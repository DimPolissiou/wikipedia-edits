In an Eastern Orthodox context, such images are typically known as ''[[Theotokos]]''. \"Madonna\" may be generally used of representations of Mary, with or without the infant Jesus, is the focus and central figure of the image, possibly flanked or surrounded by angels or saints. Other types of Marian imagery have a narrative context, depicting scenes from the [[Life of the Virgin]], e.g. the [[Annunciation to Mary]], are not typically called \"Madonna\".\n\nThe earliest depictions of Mary date still to [[Early Christianity]] (2nd to 3rd centuries), found in the [[Catacombs of Rome]].<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qd7EZAFouDgC&pg=PA191&dq=#v=onepage&q=catacomb&f=false Mary in Western Art]'' by Timothy Verdon, Filippo Rossi 2005 {{ISBN|0-9712981-9-X}} p. 11</ref> These are in a narrative context. The classical \"Madonna\" or \"Theotokos\" imagery develops from the 5th century, as [[Marian devotion]] rose to great importance after the [[Council of Ephesus]] formally affirmed her status as \"[[Mother of God]] or ''Theotokos'' (\"God-bearer\") in 431.<ref>Burke, Raymond, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ez0VRbQi1i4C&pg= Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons, Seminarians, and Consecrated Persons]'' 2008 {{ISBN|1-57918-355-7}} {{page?}}</ref> \nThe ''Theotokos'' iconography as it developed in the 6th to 8th century rose to great importance in the high medieval period (12th to 14th centuries) both in the Eastern Orthodox and in the Latin spheres. According to a tradition recorded in the 8th century, Marian iconography goes back to a portrait drawn from life by [[Luke the Evangelist]], with a number of icons (such as the ''[[Panagia Portaitissa]]'') claimed to either represent this original icon or to be a direct copy of it. In the Western tradition, depictions of the Madonna were greatly diversified by Renaissance masters such as [[Duccio]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Caravaggio]], and [[Rubens]] (and further by certain modernists such as [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] and [[Henry Moore]]), while Eastern Orthodox iconography adheres more closely to the inherited traditional types.\n\n== Terminology ==\n{{Further information|Theotokos#Terminology|Titles of Mary|Queen of Heaven}}\n\nLiturgy depicting Mary as powerful intercessor (such as the ''[[Akathist]]'') was brought from Greek into Latin tradition in the 8th century. The Greek title of \u0394\u03b5\u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1 (''Despoina'') was adopted as Latin ''Domina'' \"Lady\". The medieval Italian ''Ma Donna'' {{IPA-it|ma\u02c8d\u0254nna|pron}} (\"My Lady\") reflects ''Mea Domina'', while ''Nostra Domina'' (\u03b4\u03b5\u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03c2 \u1f21\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd) was adopted in French, as ''Nostre Dame'' \"Our Lady\".<ref>Johannes Schneider, ''Virgo Ecclesia Facta'', 2004,  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=RfvSAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA74&lpg=PA74 p. 74].\nMichael O'Carroll, ''Theotokos: A Theological Encyclopedia of the Blessed Virgin Mary'', 2000, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=xYlKAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA127 p. 127].</ref>\n\nThese names signal both the increased importance of the cult of the virgin and the prominence of art in service to Marian devotion during the late medieval period. During the 13th century, especially,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} with the increasing influence of chivalry and aristocratic culture on poetry, song and the visual arts, the Madonna is represented as the queen of Heaven, often enthroned. Madonna was meant more to remind people of the theological concept which is placing such a high value on purity or virginity. This is also represented by the color of her clothing. The color blue symbolized purity, virginity, and royalty.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}<!--blue in Mary's dress appears to be *much* older than the 13th century. Cite some references please.-->\n\nWhile the Italian term ''Madonna'' paralleled English ''Our Lady'' in late medieval Marian devotion, it was imported as an [[Art history|art historical]] term into English usage in the 1640s, designating specifically the Marian art of the [[Italian Renaissance]]. In this sense, \"a Madonna\", or \"a Madonna with Child\" is used of specific works of art, historically mostly of Italian works. A \"Madonna\" may alternatively be called \"Virgin\" or \"Our Lady\", but \"Madonna\" is not typically applied to eastern works; e.g. the ''[[Theotokos of Vladimir]]'' may in English be called \"Our Lady of Vladimir\", while it is less usual, but not unheard of, to refer to it as the \"Madonna of Vladimir\".<ref>\"Madonna of Vladimir\" e.g. in Hans Belting, Edmund Jephcott; Edmund Jephcott (trans.) ''Likeness and Presence: A History of the Image Before the Era of Art'', University of Chicago Press, 1996, p. 289.</ref>\n\n== Modes of representation ==\nThere are several distinct types of representation of the Madonna.\n* One type of Madonna shows Mary alone (without the child Jesus), and standing, generally glorified and with a gesture of prayer, benediction or prophesy. This type of image occurs in a number of ancient apsidal [[mosaic]]s.\n* Full-length standing images of the Madonna more frequently include the infant Jesus, who turns towards the viewer or raises his hand in benediction. The most famous Byzantine image, the [[Hodegetria]] was originally of this type, though most copies are at half-length. This type of image occurs frequently in sculpture and may be found in fragile ivory carvings, in limestone on the central door posts of many cathedrals, and in polychrome wooden or plaster casts in almost every Catholic Church. There are a number of famous paintings that depict the Madonna in this manner, notably the [[Sistine Madonna]] by [[Raphael]].\n* The \"Madonna enthroned\" is a type of image that dates from the [[Byzantine]] period and was used widely in Medieval and Renaissance times. These representations of the Madonna and Child often take the form of large altarpieces. They also occur as frescoes and apsidal mosaics. In Medieval examples the Madonna is often accompanied by angels who support the throne, or by rows of saints. In Renaissance painting, particularly High Renaissance painting, the saints may be grouped informally in a type of composition known as a [[Sacra conversazione]].\n* The [[Madonna of humility]] refers to portrayals in which the Madonna is sitting on the ground, or sitting upon a low cushion. She may be holding the Child [[Jesus]] in her lap.<ref>''Renaissance art: a topical dictionary'' by Irene Earls 1987 {{ISBN|0-313-24658-0}} page 174</ref> This style was a product of [[Order of Saint Francis|Franciscan]] piety,<ref>''A history of ideas and images in Italian art'' by James Hall 1983 {{ISBN|0-06-433317-5}} page 223</ref><ref>''Iconography of Christian Art'' by [[Gertrud Schiller]], 1971 ASIN: B0023VMZMA page 112</ref> and perhaps due to [[Simone Martini]]. It spread quickly through Italy and by 1375 examples began to appear in Spain, France and Germany. It was the most popular among the styles of the early [[Trecento]] artistic period.<ref name=Meiss>''Painting in Florence and Siena after the Black Death'' by Millard Meiss 1979 {{ISBN|0-691-00312-2}} pp. 132\u2013133</ref>\n* Half-length Madonnas are the form most frequently taken by painted icons of the Eastern Orthodox Church, where the subject matter is highly formulated so that each painting expresses one particular attribute of the \"Mother of God\". Half-length paintings of the ''Madonna and Child'' are also common in [[Italian Renaissance painting]], particularly in [[Venice]].\n* The seated \"Madonna and Child\" is a style of image that became particularly popular during the 15th century in [[Florence]] and was imitated elsewhere. These representations are usually of a small size suitable for a small altar or domestic use. They usually show Mary holding the infant Jesus in an informal and maternal manner. These paintings often include symbolic reference to the [[Passion of Christ]].\n* The \"Adoring Madonna\" is a type popular during the Renaissance. These images, usually small and intended for personal devotion, show Mary kneeling in adoration of the Christ Child. Many such images were produced in glazed terracotta as well as paint.\n* The [[nursing Madonna]] refers to portrayals of the Madonna breastfeeding the infant Jesus.\n* The iconography of the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]] is applied to marian portraiture in a variety of ways over time, depending on the interpretation of the relevant Biblical passage.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Roten |first1=Johann |title=Crescent Moon: Meaning : University of Dayton, Ohio |url=https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/c/crescent-moon-meaning.php |website=udayton.edu}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Anonymous Madonna with big breasts.jpg|thumb|Painting of the Madonna and Child by an anonymous Italian, first half of 19th century]]\nThe earliest representation of the Madonna and Child may be the wall painting in the [[Catacombs of Rome|Catacomb of Priscilla]], Rome, in which the seated Madonna suckles the Child, who turns his head to gaze at the spectator.<ref>Victor Lasareff, \"Studies in the Iconography of the Virgin\" ''The Art Bulletin'' '''20'''.1 (March 1938, pp. 26-65) p 27f.</ref>\n\nThe earliest consistent representations of Mother and Child were developed in the Eastern Empire, where despite an [[Byzantine iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] strain in culture that rejected physical representations as \"[[idolatry|idols]]\", respect for venerated images was expressed in the repetition of a narrow range of highly conventionalized types, the repeated images familiar as [[icon]]s ([[Greek language|Greek]] \"image\"). On a visit to Constantinople in 536, [[Pope Agapetus I|Pope Agapetus]] was accused of being opposed to the veneration of the ''theotokos'' and to the portrayal of her image in churches.<ref>m. Mundell, \"Monophysite church decoration\" ''Iconoclasm'' (Birmingham) 1977, p 72.</ref> Eastern examples show the Madonna enthroned, even wearing the closed Byzantine pearl-encrusted crown with pendants, with the Christ Child on her lap.<ref>As in the fresco fragments of the lower [[Basilica di San Clemente]], Rome: see John L. Osborne, \"Early Medieval Painting in San Clemente, Rome: The Madonna and Child in the Niche\" ''Gesta'' '''20'''.2 (1981), pp. 299-310.</ref>\n\nIn the West, hieratic Byzantine models were closely followed in the Early Middle Ages, but with the increased importance of the cult of the Virgin in the 12th and 13th centuries a wide variety of types developed to satisfy a flood of more intensely personal forms of piety. In the usual Gothic and Renaissance formulas the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] sits with the [[Child Jesus|Infant Jesus]] on her lap, or enfolded in her arms. In earlier representations the Virgin is enthroned, and the Child may be fully aware, raising his hand to offer blessing. In a 15th-century Italian variation, a baby [[John the Baptist]] looks on.\n\nLate Gothic sculptures of the Virgin and Child may show a standing virgin with the child in her arms. [[Iconography]] varies between public images and private images supplied on a smaller scale and meant for personal devotion in the chamber: the Virgin [[Breastfeeding|suckling]] the Child (such as the ''[[Madonna Litta]]'') is an image largely confined to private devotional icons.\n\n===Early images===\n[[File:Mary & Child Icon Sinai 6th century.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of the enthroned ''Virgin and Child'' with saints and angels, and the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] above, 6th century, [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], perhaps the earliest iconic image of the subject to survive.]]\n\nThere was a great expansion of the [[cult (religion)|cult of Mary]] after the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] in 431, when her status as [[Theotokos]] (\"God-bearer\") was confirmed; this had been a subject of some controversy until then, though mainly for reasons to do with [[Christology|arguments over the nature of Christ]].  In [[mosaic]]s in [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome, dating from 432-40, just after the council, she is not yet shown with a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], and she is also not shown in Nativity scenes at this date, though she is included in the [[Adoration of the Magi]].\n\nBy the next century the iconic depiction of the Virgin enthroned carrying the infant Christ was established, as in the example from the only group of icons surviving from this period, at [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in [[Egypt]]. This type of depiction, with subtly changing differences of emphasis, has remained the mainstay of depictions of Mary to the present day. The image at Mount Sinai succeeds in combining two aspects of Mary described in the [[Magnificat]], her [[humility]] and her [[wikt:exaltation|exaltation]] above other humans, and has the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] above, up to which the archangels look. An early icon of the Virgin as queen is in the church of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]] in Rome, datable to 705-707 by the kneeling figure of [[Pope John VII]], a notable promoter of the cult of the Virgin, to whom the infant Christ reaches his hand.  This type was long confined to Rome.  The roughly half-dozen varied icons of the Virgin and Child in Rome from the 6th - 8th century form the majority of the representations surviving from this period; \"isolated images of the Madonna and Child ... are so common ... to the present day in Catholic and Orthodox tradition, that it is difficult to recover a sense of the novelty of such images in the early Middle Ages, at least in western Europe\".<ref>Nees, Lawrence. ''Early medieval art'', 143-145, quote 144, Oxford University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-19-284243-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-284243-5}}</ref>\n\nAt this period the [[iconography]] of the Nativity was taking [[Nativity of Jesus in art#Byzantine image|the form, centred on Mary]], that it has retained up to the present day in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], and on which Western depictions remained based until the [[High Middle Ages]].  Other narrative scenes for Byzantine cycles on the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' were being evolved, relying on [[New Testament apocrypha|apocypha]]l sources to fill in her life before the [[Annunciation to Mary]].  By this time the political and economic collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] meant that the Western, Latin, church was unable to compete in the development of such sophisticated [[iconography]], and relied heavily on Byzantine developments.\n\nThe earliest surviving image in a Western [[illuminated manuscript]] of the [[Madonna and Child]] comes from the [[Book of Kells]] of about 800 (there is a similar carved image on the lid of [[St Cuthbert's coffin]] of 698) and, though magnificently decorated in the style of [[Insular art]], the drawing of the figures can only be described as rather crude compared to Byzantine work of the period.  This was in fact an unusual inclusion in a [[Gospel book]], and images of the Virgin were slow to appear in large numbers in manuscript art until the [[book of hours]] was devised in the 13th century.\n\nThe ''[[Madonna of humility]]'' by [[:File:Madonna-of-humility- 1433 Domenico di Bartolo.jpg|Domenico di Bartolo]], 1433, is considered one of the most innovative devotional images from the early [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]].<ref Name =Trinchieri>''Art and music in the early modern period'' by Franca Trinchieri Camiz, Katherine A. McIver {{ISBN|0-7546-0689-9}} page 15 [https://books.google.com/books?id=mdIFQTuA4cQC&pg=PA15]</ref>\n\n===Byzantine influence on the West===\n[[File:Italo-Byzantinischer Maler des 13. Jahrhunderts 001.jpg|thumb|upright|13th century ''Madonna with Child'' in the Italo-Byzantine style.]]\n\nVery few early images of the Virgin Mary survive, though the depiction of the Madonna has roots in ancient pictorial and sculptural traditions that informed the earliest Christian communities throughout Europe, Northern Africa and the Middle East.  Important to Italian tradition are [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] [[icons]], especially those created in [[Constantinople]] (Istanbul), the capital of the longest, enduring [[medieval]] civilization whose icons participated in civic life and were celebrated for their miraculous properties.  Byzantium (324-1453) saw itself as the true [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], if [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking, Christian empire with colonies of Italians living among its citizens, participating in [[Crusades]] at the borders of its land, and ultimately, plundering its churches, palaces and monasteries of many of its treasures.  Later in the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Cretan school]] was the main source of icons for the West, and the artists there could adapt their style to Western [[iconography]] when required.\n\nWhile theft is one way that Byzantine images made their way West to Italy, the relationship between Byzantine icons and Italian images of the Madonna is far more rich and complicated.  Byzantine art played a long, critical role in Western Europe, especially when Byzantine territories included parts of Eastern Europe, Greece and much of Italy itself.  Byzantine manuscripts, ivories, gold, silver and [[Byzantine silk|luxurious textiles]] were distributed throughout the West.  In Byzantium, Mary's usual title was the [[Theotokos]] or Mother of God, rather than the Virgin Mary and it was believed that [[salvation]] was delivered to the faithful at the moment of God's [[incarnation]]. That [[theological]] concept takes pictorial form in the image of Mary holding her infant son.\n\nHowever, what is most relevant to the Byzantine heritage of the Madonna is twofold.  First, the earliest surviving independent images of the Virgin Mary are found in Rome, the center of Christianity in the medieval West.  One is a valued possession of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]], one of the many Roman churches dedicated to the Virgin Mary.  Another, a splintered, repainted ghost of its former self, is venerated at the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], that great architectural wonder of the Ancient [[Roman Empire]], that was rededicated to Mary as an expression of the Church's triumph.  Both evoke Byzantine tradition in terms of their medium, that is, the technique and materials of the paintings, in that they were originally painted in [[tempera]] (egg yolk and ground pigments) on wooden panels.  In this respect, they share the Ancient Roman heritage of Byzantine icons.  Second, they share [[iconography]], or subject matter.  Each image stresses the maternal role that Mary plays, representing her in relationship to her infant son.  It is difficult to gauge the dates of the cluster of these earlier images, however, they seem to be primarily works of the 7th and 8th centuries.\n\n===Later medieval period===\nIt was not until the revival of monumental [[panel painting]] in Italy during the 12th and 13th centuries, that the image of the Madonna gains prominence outside of Rome, especially throughout [[Tuscany]].  While members of the [[mendicant orders]] of the [[Franciscan]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Orders are some of the first to commission panels representing this subject matter, such works quickly became popular in monasteries, parish churches, and homes.  Some images of the Madonna were paid for by lay organizations called confraternities, who met to sing praises of the Virgin in chapels found within the newly reconstructed, spacious churches that were sometimes dedicated to her.  Paying for such a work might also be seen as a form of devotion.  Its expense registers in the use of thin sheets of real [[gold leaf]] in all parts of the panel that are not covered with paint, a visual analogue not only to the costly sheaths that medieval [[goldsmith]]s used to decorate altars, but also a means of surrounding the image of the Madonna with illumination from oil lamps and candles.  Even more precious is the bright blue mantle colored with [[lapis lazuli]], a stone imported from Afghanistan.\n\nThis is the case of one of the most famous, innovative and monumental works that Duccio executed for the Laudesi at Santa Maria Novella in Florence.  Often the scale of the work indicates a great deal about its original function.  Often referred to as the Rucellia Madonna (c. 1285), the panel painting towers over the spectator, offering a visual focus for members of the Laudesi confraternity to gather before it as they sang praises to the image.  Duccio made an even grander image of the Madonna enthroned for the high altar of the cathedral of Siena, his home town.  Known as the ''Maesta'' (1308\u20131311), the image represents the pair as the center of a densely populated court in the central part of a complexly carpentered work that lifts the court upon a predella (pedestal of altarpiece) of narrative scenes and standing figures of prophets and saints.  In turn, a modestly scaled image of the Madonna as a half-length figure holding her son in a memorably intimate depiction, is to be found in the National Gallery of London.  This is clearly made for the private devotion of a Christian wealthy enough to hire one of the most important Italian artists of his day.\n\nThe privileged owner need not go to Church to say his prayers or plead for salvation; all he or she had to do was open the shutters of the tabernacle in an act of private revelation. Duccio and his contemporaries inherited early pictorial conventions that were maintained, in part, to tie their own works to the authority of tradition.\n\nDespite all of the innovations of painters of the Madonna during the 13th and 14th centuries, Mary can usually be recognized by virtue of her attire.  Customarily when she is represented as a youthful mother of her newborn child, she wears a deeply saturated blue mantle over a red garment.  This mantle typically covers her head, where sometimes, one might see a linen, or later, transparent silk veil.  She holds the Christ Child, or Baby Jesus, who shares her halo as well as her regal bearing.  Often her gaze is directed out at the viewer, serving as an intercessor, or [[Conduit (spiritualism)|conduit]] for prayers that flow from the Christian, to her, and only then, to her son. However, late medieval Italian artists also followed the trends of Byzantine icon painting, developing their own methods of depicting the Madonna. Sometimes, the Madonna's complex bond with her tiny child takes the form of a close, intimate moment of tenderness steeped in sorrow where she only has eyes for him.\n\nWhile the focus of this entry currently stresses the depiction of the Madonna in panel painting, her image also appears in mural decoration, whether mosaics or fresco painting on the exteriors and interior of sacred buildings.  She is found high above the apse, or east end of the church where the liturgy is celebrated in the West.  She is also found in sculpted form, whether small ivories for private devotion, or large sculptural reliefs and free-standing sculpture.  As a participant in sacred drama, her image inspires one of the most important fresco cycles in all of Italian painting: Giotto's narrative cycle in the Arena Chapel, next to the Scrovegni family's palace in Padua.  This program dates to the first decade of the 14th century.\n\nItalian artists of the 15th century onward are indebted to traditions established in the 13th and 14th centuries in their representation of the Madonna.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Gerard David - The rest on the flight into Egypt (National Gallery of Art).jpg|''[[Rest on the Flight into Egypt (David, National Gallery of Art)|Rest on The Flight into Egypt]]'', c. 1510,<ref>[http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.50.html National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.]</ref> by [[Gerard David]] depicts a close, intimate moment of tenderness where she only has eyes for the Child.\nFile:Don Lorenzo Monaco 013.jpg|[[Lorenzo Monaco]], [[Florence]], c. 1410\n</gallery>\n\n===Renaissance===\nWhile the 15th and 16th centuries were a time when Italian painters expanded their repertoire to include historical events, independent portraits and mythological subject matter, Christianity retained a strong hold on their careers.  Most works of art from this era are sacred.  While the range of religious subject matter included subjects from the Old Testament and images of saints whose cults date after the codification of the Bible, the Madonna remained a dominant subject in the iconography of the Renaissance.\n\nSome of the most eminent 16th-century Italian painters to turn to this subject were [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]],{{NoteTag|According to [[W.&nbsp;H. Wackenroder]], some writings by [[Bramante]] reveal that Raphael told him that he discovered how to paint his Madonnas in a visionary dream he had after praying to the Virgin.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Salmi |first1=Mario |author1-link=Mario Salmi |last2=Becherucci |first2=Luisa |last3=Marabottini |first3=Alessandro |last4=Tempesti |first4=Anna Forlani |last5=Marchini |first5=Giuseppe |last6=Becatti |author6-link=Giovanni Becatti |first6=Giovanni |last7=Castagnoli |first7=Ferdinando |author7-link=Ferdinando Castagnoli |last8=Golzio |first8=Vincenzo |title=The Complete Work of Raphael |year = 1969 |publisher=Reynal and Co., [[William Morrow and Company]] |location = New York, NY |page = 622 }}</ref>}} [[Giorgione]], [[Giovanni Bellini]] and [[Titian]]. They developed on the foundations of 15th-century Marian images by [[Fra Angelico]], [[Fra Filippo Lippi]], [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] and [[Piero della Francesca]] in particular, among countless others. The subject was equally popular in [[Early Netherlandish painting]] and that of the rest of Northern Europe.\n\nThe subject retaining the greatest power on all of these men remained the maternal bond, even though other subjects, especially the [[Annunciation]], and later the [[Immaculate Conception]], led to a greater number of paintings that represented Mary alone, without her son.  As a commemorative image, the ''[[Piet\u00e0]]'' became an important subject, newly freed from its former role in narrative cycles, in part, an outgrowth of popular devotional statues in Northern Europe. Traditionally, Mary is depicted expressing compassion, grief and love, usually in highly charged, emotional works of art even though the most famous, early work by Michelangelo stifles signs of mourning. The tenderness an ordinary mother might feel towards her beloved child is captured, evoking the moment when she first held her infant son [[Christ]].  The spectator, after all, is meant to sympathize, to share in the despair of the mother who holds the body of her crucified son.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"220px\">\nFile:15th-century unknown painters - Madonna on a Crescent Moon in Hortus Conclusus - WGA23736.jpg|The ''Madonna [[Woman of the Apocalypse|on a Crescent Moon]] in [[Hortus Conclusus]]'' by an [[anonymity|anonymous]] painter.\nFile:Leonardo da Vinci - study of a woman's head.jpg|[[Leonardo da Vinci]], a study of the Head of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Madonna]], c. 1484 AD.\n</gallery>\n\n===Modern images===\n[[File:La Vierge au lys.jpg|thumb|180px|''Virgin of the Lilies'', [[Bouguereau]], 1899]]\n\nIn some European countries, such as Germany, Italy and Poland sculptures of the Madonna are found on the outside of city houses and buildings, or along the roads in small enclosures.\n\nIn Germany, such a statue placed on the outside of a building is called a ''Hausmadonna''.

In an Eastern Orthodox context, such images are typically known as ''[[Theotokos]]''. \"Madonna\" may be generally used of representations of Mary, with or without the infant Jesus, is the focus and central figure of the image, possibly flanked or surrounded by angels or saints. Other types of Marian imagery have a narrative context, depicting scenes from the [[Life of the Virgin]], e.g. the [[Annunciation to Mary]], are not typically called \"Madonna\".\n\nThe earliest depictions of Mary date still to [[Early Christianity]] (2nd to 3rd centuries), found in the [[Catacombs of Rome]].<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qd7EZAFouDgC&pg=PA191&dq=#v=onepage&q=catacomb&f=false Mary in Western Art]'' by Timothy Verdon, Filippo Rossi 2005 {{ISBN|0-9712981-9-X}} page 11</ref> These are in a narrative context. The classical \"Madonna\" or \"Theotokos\" imagery develops from the 5th century, as [[Marian devotion]] rose to great importance after the [[Council of Ephesus]] formally affirmed her status as \"[[Mother of God]] or ''Theotokos'' (\"God-bearer\") in 431.<ref>Burke, Raymond, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ez0VRbQi1i4C&pg= Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons, Seminarians, and Consecrated Persons]'' 2008 {{ISBN|1-57918-355-7}} page</ref> \nThe ''Theotokos'' iconography as it developed in the 6th to 8th century rose to great importance in the high medieval period (12th to 14th centuries) both in the Eastern Orthodox and in the Latin spheres. According to a tradition recorded in the 8th century, Marian iconography goes back to a portrait drawn from life by [[Luke the Evangelist]], with a number of icons (such as the ''[[Panagia Portaitissa]]'') claimed to either represent this original icon or to be a direct copy of it. In the Western tradition, depictions of the Madonna were greatly diversified by Renaissance masters such as [[Duccio]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Caravaggio]], and [[Rubens]] (and further by certain modernists such as [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] and [[Henry Moore]]), while Eastern Orthodox iconography adheres more closely to the inherited traditional types.\n\n== Terminology ==\n{{Further information|Theotokos#Terminology|Titles of Mary|Queen of Heaven}}\n\nLiturgy depicting Mary as powerful intercessor (such as the ''[[Akathist]]'') was brought from Greek into Latin tradition in the 8th century. The Greek title of \u0394\u03b5\u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1 (''Despoina'') was adopted as Latin ''Domina'' \"Lady\". The medieval Italian ''Ma Donna'' {{IPA-it|ma\u02c8d\u0254nna|pron}} (\"My Lady\") reflects ''Mea Domina'', while ''Nostra Domina'' (\u03b4\u03b5\u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03c2 \u1f21\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd) was adopted in French, as ''Nostre Dame'' \"Our Lady\".<ref>Johannes Schneider, ''Virgo Ecclesia Facta'', 2004,  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=RfvSAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA74&lpg=PA74 p. 74].\nMichael O'Carroll, ''Theotokos: A Theological Encyclopedia of the Blessed Virgin Mary'', 2000, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=xYlKAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA127 p. 127].</ref>\n\nThese names signal both the increased importance of the cult of the virgin and the prominence of art in service to Marian devotion during the late medieval period. During the 13th century, especially,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} with the increasing influence of chivalry and aristocratic culture on poetry, song and the visual arts, the Madonna is represented as the queen of Heaven, often enthroned. Madonna was meant more to remind people of the theological concept which is placing such a high value on purity or virginity. This is also represented by the color of her clothing. The color blue symbolized purity, virginity, and royalty.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}<!--blue in Mary's dress appears to be *much* older than the 13th century. Cite some references please.-->\n\nWhile the Italian term ''Madonna'' paralleled English ''Our Lady'' in late medieval Marian devotion, it was imported as an [[Art history|art historical]] term into English usage in the 1640s, designating specifically the Marian art of the [[Italian Renaissance]]. In this sense, \"a Madonna\", or \"a Madonna with Child\" is used of specific works of art, historically mostly of Italian works. A \"Madonna\" may alternatively be called \"Virgin\" or \"Our Lady\", but \"Madonna\" is not typically applied to eastern works; e.g. the ''[[Theotokos of Vladimir]]'' may in English be called \"Our Lady of Vladimir\", while it is less usual, but not unheard of, to refer to it as the \"Madonna of Vladimir\".<ref>\"Madonna of Vladimir\" e.g. in Hans Belting, Edmund Jephcott; Edmund Jephcott (trans.) ''Likeness and Presence: A History of the Image Before the Era of Art'', University of Chicago Press, 1996, p. 289.</ref>\n\n== Modes of representation ==\nThere are several distinct types of representation of the Madonna.\n* One type of Madonna shows Mary alone (without the child Jesus), and standing, generally glorified and with a gesture of prayer, benediction or prophesy. This type of image occurs in a number of ancient apsidal [[mosaic]]s.\n* Full-length standing images of the Madonna more frequently include the infant Jesus, who turns towards the viewer or raises his hand in benediction. The most famous Byzantine image, the [[Hodegetria]] was originally of this type, though most copies are at half-length. This type of image occurs frequently in sculpture and may be found in fragile ivory carvings, in limestone on the central door posts of many cathedrals, and in polychrome wooden or plaster casts in almost every Catholic Church. There are a number of famous paintings that depict the Madonna in this manner, notably the [[Sistine Madonna]] by [[Raphael]].\n* The \"Madonna enthroned\" is a type of image that dates from the [[Byzantine]] period and was used widely in Medieval and Renaissance times. These representations of the Madonna and Child often take the form of large altarpieces. They also occur as frescoes and apsidal mosaics. In Medieval examples the Madonna is often accompanied by angels who support the throne, or by rows of saints. In Renaissance painting, particularly High Renaissance painting, the saints may be grouped informally in a type of composition known as a [[Sacra conversazione]].\n* The [[Madonna of humility]] refers to portrayals in which the Madonna is sitting on the ground, or sitting upon a low cushion. She may be holding the Child [[Jesus]] in her lap.<ref>''Renaissance art: a topical dictionary'' by Irene Earls 1987 {{ISBN|0-313-24658-0}} page 174</ref> This style was a product of [[Order of Saint Francis|Franciscan]] piety,<ref>''A history of ideas and images in Italian art'' by James Hall 1983 {{ISBN|0-06-433317-5}} page 223</ref><ref>''Iconography of Christian Art'' by [[Gertrud Schiller]], 1971 ASIN: B0023VMZMA page 112</ref> and perhaps due to [[Simone Martini]]. It spread quickly through Italy and by 1375 examples began to appear in Spain, France and Germany. It was the most popular among the styles of the early [[Trecento]] artistic period.<ref name=Meiss>''Painting in Florence and Siena after the Black Death'' by Millard Meiss 1979 {{ISBN|0-691-00312-2}} pp. 132\u2013133</ref>\n* Half-length Madonnas are the form most frequently taken by painted icons of the Eastern Orthodox Church, where the subject matter is highly formulated so that each painting expresses one particular attribute of the \"Mother of God\". Half-length paintings of the ''Madonna and Child'' are also common in [[Italian Renaissance painting]], particularly in [[Venice]].\n* The seated \"Madonna and Child\" is a style of image that became particularly popular during the 15th century in [[Florence]] and was imitated elsewhere. These representations are usually of a small size suitable for a small altar or domestic use. They usually show Mary holding the infant Jesus in an informal and maternal manner. These paintings often include symbolic reference to the [[Passion of Christ]].\n* The \"Adoring Madonna\" is a type popular during the Renaissance. These images, usually small and intended for personal devotion, show Mary kneeling in adoration of the Christ Child. Many such images were produced in glazed terracotta as well as paint.\n* The [[nursing Madonna]] refers to portrayals of the Madonna breastfeeding the infant Jesus.\n* The iconography of the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]] is applied to marian portraiture in a variety of ways over time, depending on the interpretation of the relevant Biblical passage.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Roten |first1=Johann |title=Crescent Moon: Meaning : University of Dayton, Ohio |url=https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/c/crescent-moon-meaning.php |website=udayton.edu}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Anonymous Madonna with big breasts.jpg|thumb|Painting of the Madonna and Child by an anonymous Italian, first half of 19th century]]\nThe earliest representation of the Madonna and Child may be the wall painting in the [[Catacombs of Rome|Catacomb of Priscilla]], Rome, in which the seated Madonna suckles the Child, who turns his head to gaze at the spectator.<ref>Victor Lasareff, \"Studies in the Iconography of the Virgin\" ''The Art Bulletin'' '''20'''.1 (March 1938, pp. 26-65) p 27f.</ref>\n\nThe earliest consistent representations of Mother and Child were developed in the Eastern Empire, where despite an [[Byzantine iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] strain in culture that rejected physical representations as \"[[idolatry|idols]]\", respect for venerated images was expressed in the repetition of a narrow range of highly conventionalized types, the repeated images familiar as [[icon]]s ([[Greek language|Greek]] \"image\"). On a visit to Constantinople in 536, [[Pope Agapetus I|Pope Agapetus]] was accused of being opposed to the veneration of the ''theotokos'' and to the portrayal of her image in churches.<ref>m.

Osborne, \"Early Medieval Painting in San Clemente, Rome: The Madonna and Child in the Niche\" ''Gesta'' '''20'''.2 (1981), pp. 299-310.</ref>\n\nIn the West, hieratic Byzantine models were closely followed in the Early Middle Ages, but with the increased importance of the cult of the Virgin in the 12th and 13th centuries a wide variety of types developed to satisfy a flood of more intensely personal forms of piety. In the usual Gothic and Renaissance formulas the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] sits with the [[Child Jesus|Infant Jesus]] on her lap, or enfolded in her arms. In earlier representations the Virgin is enthroned, and the Child may be fully aware, raising his hand to offer blessing. In a 15th-century Italian variation, a baby [[John the Baptist]] looks on.\n\nLate Gothic sculptures of the Virgin and Child may show a standing virgin with the child in her arms. [[Iconography]] varies between public images and private images supplied on a smaller scale and meant for personal devotion in the chamber: the Virgin [[Breastfeeding|suckling]] the Child (such as the ''[[Madonna Litta]]'') is an image largely confined to private devotional icons.\n\n===Early images===\n[[File:Mary & Child Icon Sinai 6th century.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of the enthroned ''Virgin and Child'' with saints and angels, and the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] above, 6th century, [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], perhaps the earliest iconic image of the subject to survive.]]\n\nThere was a great expansion of the [[cult (religion)|cult of Mary]] after the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] in 431, when her status as [[Theotokos]] (\"God-bearer\") was confirmed; this had been a subject of some controversy until then, though mainly for reasons to do with [[Christology|arguments over the nature of Christ]].  In [[mosaic]]s in [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome, dating from 432-40, just after the council, she is not yet shown with a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], and she is also not shown in Nativity scenes at this date, though she is included in the [[Adoration of the Magi]].\n\nBy the next century the iconic depiction of the Virgin enthroned carrying the infant Christ was established, as in the example from the only group of icons surviving from this period, at [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in [[Egypt]]. This type of depiction, with subtly changing differences of emphasis, has remained the mainstay of depictions of Mary to the present day. The image at Mount Sinai succeeds in combining two aspects of Mary described in the [[Magnificat]], her [[humility]] and her [[wikt:exaltation|exaltation]] above other humans, and has the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] above, up to which the archangels look. An early icon of the Virgin as queen is in the church of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]] in Rome, datable to 705-707 by the kneeling figure of [[Pope John VII]], a notable promoter of the cult of the Virgin, to whom the infant Christ reaches his hand.  This type was long confined to Rome.  The roughly half-dozen varied icons of the Virgin and Child in Rome from the 6th - 8th century form the majority of the representations surviving from this period; \"isolated images of the Madonna and Child ... are so common ... to the present day in Catholic and Orthodox tradition, that it is difficult to recover a sense of the novelty of such images in the early Middle Ages, at least in western Europe\".<ref>Nees, Lawrence. ''Early medieval art'', 143-145, quote 144, Oxford University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-19-284243-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-284243-5}}</ref>\n\nAt this period the [[iconography]] of the Nativity was taking [[Nativity of Jesus in art#Byzantine image|the form, centred on Mary]], that it has retained up to the present day in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], and on which Western depictions remained based until the [[High Middle Ages]].  Other narrative scenes for Byzantine cycles on the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' were being evolved, relying on [[New Testament apocrypha|apocypha]]l sources to fill in her life before the [[Annunciation to Mary]].  By this time the political and economic collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] meant that the Western, Latin, church was unable to compete in the development of such sophisticated [[iconography]], and relied heavily on Byzantine developments.\n\nThe earliest surviving image in a Western [[illuminated manuscript]] of the [[Madonna and Child]] comes from the [[Book of Kells]] of about 800 (there is a similar carved image on the lid of [[St Cuthbert's coffin]] of 698) and, though magnificently decorated in the style of [[Insular art]], the drawing of the figures can only be described as rather crude compared to Byzantine work of the period.  This was in fact an unusual inclusion in a [[Gospel book]], and images of the Virgin were slow to appear in large numbers in manuscript art until the [[book of hours]] was devised in the 13th century.\n\nThe ''[[Madonna of humility]]'' by [[:File:Madonna-of-humility- 1433 Domenico di Bartolo.jpg|Domenico di Bartolo]], 1433, is considered one of the most innovative devotional images from the early [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]].<ref Name =Trinchieri>''Art and music in the early modern period'' by Franca Trinchieri Camiz, Katherine A. McIver {{ISBN|0-7546-0689-9}} page 15 [https://books.google.com/books?id=mdIFQTuA4cQC&pg=PA15]</ref>\n\n===Byzantine influence on the West===\n[[File:Italo-Byzantinischer Maler des 13. Jahrhunderts 001.jpg|thumb|upright|13th century ''Madonna with Child'' in the Italo-Byzantine style.]]\n\nVery few early images of the Virgin Mary survive, though the depiction of the Madonna has roots in ancient pictorial and sculptural traditions that informed the earliest Christian communities throughout Europe, Northern Africa and the Middle East.  Important to Italian tradition are [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] [[icons]], especially those created in [[Constantinople]] (Istanbul), the capital of the longest, enduring [[medieval]] civilization whose icons participated in civic life and were celebrated for their miraculous properties.  Byzantium (324-1453) saw itself as the true [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], if [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking, Christian empire with colonies of Italians living among its citizens, participating in [[Crusades]] at the borders of its land, and ultimately, plundering its churches, palaces and monasteries of many of its treasures.  Later in the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Cretan school]] was the main source of icons for the West, and the artists there could adapt their style to Western [[iconography]] when required.\n\nWhile theft is one way that Byzantine images made their way West to Italy, the relationship between Byzantine icons and Italian images of the Madonna is far more rich and complicated.  Byzantine art played a long, critical role in Western Europe, especially when Byzantine territories included parts of Eastern Europe, Greece and much of Italy itself.  Byzantine manuscripts, ivories, gold, silver and [[Byzantine silk|luxurious textiles]] were distributed throughout the West.  In Byzantium, Mary's usual title was the [[Theotokos]] or Mother of God, rather than the Virgin Mary and it was believed that [[salvation]] was delivered to the faithful at the moment of God's [[incarnation]]. That [[theological]] concept takes pictorial form in the image of Mary holding her infant son.\n\nHowever, what is most relevant to the Byzantine heritage of the Madonna is twofold.  First, the earliest surviving independent images of the Virgin Mary are found in Rome, the center of Christianity in the medieval West.  One is a valued possession of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]], one of the many Roman churches dedicated to the Virgin Mary.  Another, a splintered, repainted ghost of its former self, is venerated at the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], that great architectural wonder of the Ancient [[Roman Empire]], that was rededicated to Mary as an expression of the Church's triumph.  Both evoke Byzantine tradition in terms of their medium, that is, the technique and materials of the paintings, in that they were originally painted in [[tempera]] (egg yolk and ground pigments) on wooden panels.  In this respect, they share the Ancient Roman heritage of Byzantine icons.  Second, they share [[iconography]], or subject matter.  Each image stresses the maternal role that Mary plays, representing her in relationship to her infant son.  It is difficult to gauge the dates of the cluster of these earlier images, however, they seem to be primarily works of the 7th and 8th centuries.\n\n===Later medieval period===\nIt was not until the revival of monumental [[panel painting]] in Italy during the 12th and 13th centuries, that the image of the Madonna gains prominence outside of Rome, especially throughout [[Tuscany]].  While members of the [[mendicant orders]] of the [[Franciscan]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Orders are some of the first to commission panels representing this subject matter, such works quickly became popular in monasteries, parish churches, and homes.  Some images of the Madonna were paid for by lay organizations called confraternities, who met to sing praises of the Virgin in chapels found within the newly reconstructed, spacious churches that were sometimes dedicated to her.  Paying for such a work might also be seen as a form of devotion.  Its expense registers in the use of thin sheets of real [[gold leaf]] in all parts of the panel that are not covered with paint, a visual analogue not only to the costly sheaths that medieval [[goldsmith]]s used to decorate altars, but also a means of surrounding the image of the Madonna with illumination from oil lamps and candles.  Even more precious is the bright blue mantle colored with [[lapis lazuli]], a stone imported from Afghanistan.\n\nThis is the case of one of the most famous, innovative and monumental works that Duccio executed for the Laudesi at Santa Maria Novella in Florence.  Often the scale of the work indicates a great deal about its original function.  Often referred to as the Rucellia Madonna (c. 1285), the panel painting towers over the spectator, offering a visual focus for members of the Laudesi confraternity to gather before it as they sang praises to the image.  Duccio made an even grander image of the Madonna enthroned for the high altar of the cathedral of Siena, his home town.  Known as the ''Maesta'' (1308\u20131311), the image represents the pair as the center of a densely populated court in the central part of a complexly carpentered work that lifts the court upon a predella (pedestal of altarpiece) of narrative scenes and standing figures of prophets and saints.  In turn, a modestly scaled image of the Madonna as a half-length figure holding her son in a memorably intimate depiction, is to be found in the National Gallery of London.  This is clearly made for the private devotion of a Christian wealthy enough to hire one of the most important Italian artists of his day.\n\nThe privileged owner need not go to Church to say his prayers or plead for salvation; all he or she had to do was open the shutters of the tabernacle in an act of private revelation. Duccio and his contemporaries inherited early pictorial conventions that were maintained, in part, to tie their own works to the authority of tradition.\n\nDespite all of the innovations of painters of the Madonna during the 13th and 14th centuries, Mary can usually be recognized by virtue of her attire.  Customarily when she is represented as a youthful mother of her newborn child, she wears a deeply saturated blue mantle over a red garment.  This mantle typically covers her head, where sometimes, one might see a linen, or later, transparent silk veil.  She holds the Christ Child, or Baby Jesus, who shares her halo as well as her regal bearing.  Often her gaze is directed out at the viewer, serving as an intercessor, or [[Conduit (spiritualism)|conduit]] for prayers that flow from the Christian, to her, and only then, to her son. However, late medieval Italian artists also followed the trends of Byzantine icon painting, developing their own methods of depicting the Madonna. Sometimes, the Madonna's complex bond with her tiny child takes the form of a close, intimate moment of tenderness steeped in sorrow where she only has eyes for him.\n\nWhile the focus of this entry currently stresses the depiction of the Madonna in panel painting, her image also appears in mural decoration, whether mosaics or fresco painting on the exteriors and interior of sacred buildings.  She is found high above the apse, or east end of the church where the liturgy is celebrated in the West.  She is also found in sculpted form, whether small ivories for private devotion, or large sculptural reliefs and free-standing sculpture.  As a participant in sacred drama, her image inspires one of the most important fresco cycles in all of Italian painting: Giotto's narrative cycle in the Arena Chapel, next to the Scrovegni family's palace in Padua.  This program dates to the first decade of the 14th century.\n\nItalian artists of the 15th century onward are indebted to traditions established in the 13th and 14th centuries in their representation of the Madonna.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Gerard David - The rest on the flight into Egypt (National Gallery of Art).jpg|''[[Rest on the Flight into Egypt (David, National Gallery of Art)|Rest on The Flight into Egypt]]'', c. 1510,<ref>[http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.50.html National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.]</ref> by [[Gerard David]] depicts a close, intimate moment of tenderness where she only has eyes for the Child.\nFile:Don Lorenzo Monaco 013.jpg|[[Lorenzo Monaco]], [[Florence]], c. 1410\n</gallery>\n\n===Renaissance===\nWhile the 15th and 16th centuries were a time when Italian painters expanded their repertoire to include historical events, independent portraits and mythological subject matter, Christianity retained a strong hold on their careers.  Most works of art from this era are sacred.  While the range of religious subject matter included subjects from the Old Testament and images of saints whose cults date after the codification of the Bible, the Madonna remained a dominant subject in the iconography of the Renaissance.\n\nSome of the most eminent 16th-century Italian painters to turn to this subject were [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]],{{NoteTag|According to [[W.&nbsp;H. Wackenroder]], some writings by [[Bramante]] reveal that Raphael told him that he discovered how to paint his Madonnas in a visionary dream he had after praying to the Virgin.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Salmi |first1=Mario |author1-link=Mario Salmi |last2=Becherucci |first2=Luisa |last3=Marabottini |first3=Alessandro |last4=Tempesti |first4=Anna Forlani |last5=Marchini |first5=Giuseppe |last6=Becatti |author6-link=Giovanni Becatti |first6=Giovanni |last7=Castagnoli |first7=Ferdinando |author7-link=Ferdinando Castagnoli |last8=Golzio |first8=Vincenzo |title=The Complete Work of Raphael |year = 1969 |publisher=Reynal and Co., [[William Morrow and Company]] |location = New York, NY |page = 622 }}</ref>}} [[Giorgione]], [[Giovanni Bellini]] and [[Titian]]. They developed on the foundations of 15th-century Marian images by [[Fra Angelico]], [[Fra Filippo Lippi]], [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] and [[Piero della Francesca]] in particular, among countless others. The subject was equally popular in [[Early Netherlandish painting]] and that of the rest of Northern Europe.\n\nThe subject retaining the greatest power on all of these men remained the maternal bond, even though other subjects, especially the [[Annunciation]], and later the [[Immaculate Conception]], led to a greater number of paintings that represented Mary alone, without her son.  As a commemorative image, the ''[[Piet\u00e0]]'' became an important subject, newly freed from its former role in narrative cycles, in part, an outgrowth of popular devotional statues in Northern Europe. Traditionally, Mary is depicted expressing compassion, grief and love, usually in highly charged, emotional works of art even though the most famous, early work by Michelangelo stifles signs of mourning. The tenderness an ordinary mother might feel towards her beloved child is captured, evoking the moment when she first held her infant son [[Christ]].  The spectator, after all, is meant to sympathize, to share in the despair of the mother who holds the body of her crucified son.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"220px\">\nFile:15th-century unknown painters - Madonna on a Crescent Moon in Hortus Conclusus - WGA23736.jpg|The ''Madonna [[Woman of the Apocalypse|on a Crescent Moon]] in [[Hortus Conclusus]]'' by an [[anonymity|anonymous]] painter.\nFile:Leonardo da Vinci - study of a woman's head.jpg|[[Leonardo da Vinci]], a study of the Head of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Madonna]], c. 1484 AD.\n</gallery>\n\n===Modern images===\n[[File:La Vierge au lys.jpg|thumb|180px|''Virgin of the Lilies'', [[Bouguereau]], 1899]]\n\nIn some European countries, such as Germany, Italy and Poland sculptures of the Madonna are found on the outside of city houses and buildings, or along the roads in small enclosures.\n\nIn Germany, such a statue placed on the outside of a building is called a ''Hausmadonna''.

Talks over Danzig and the Corridor broke down and months passed without diplomatic interaction between Germany and Poland. During this interim period, the Germans learned that France and Britain had failed to secure an alliance with the Soviet Union against Germany, and that the Soviet Union was interested in an alliance with Germany against Poland. Hitler had already issued orders to prepare for a possible \"solution of the Polish problem by military means\" through the [[Fall Weiss (1939)|Case White]] scenario.\n\nIn May 1939, in a statement to his generals while they were in the midst of planning the invasion of Poland, Hitler made it clear that the invasion would not come without resistance as it had in Czechoslovakia:<ref name=\"Clark, Lloyd 2011, page 26\">Clark, Lloyd, ''Kursk: The Greatest Battle: Eastern Front 1943'', 2011, p. 26</ref>\n\n{{quote|With minor exceptions German national unification has been achieved.

In fact, the Soviets agreed not to aid France or the UK in the event of their going to war with Germany over Poland and, in a secret protocol of the pact, the Germans and the Soviets agreed to divide Eastern Europe, including Poland, into two [[spheres of influence]]; the western one-third of the country was to go to Germany and the eastern two-thirds to the Soviet Union.\n\nThe German assault was originally scheduled to begin at 04:00 on 26 August. However, on 25 August, the [[Polish-British Common Defence Pact]] was signed as an annex to the [[Franco-Polish alliance (1921)]]. In this accord, Britain committed itself to the defence of Poland, guaranteeing to preserve Polish independence. At the same time, the British and the Poles were hinting to Berlin that they were willing to resume discussions\u2014not at all how Hitler hoped to frame the conflict. Thus, he wavered and postponed his attack until 1 September, managing to in effect halt the entire invasion \"in mid-leap\".\n[[File:Ribbentrop-Molotov.svg|thumb|left|Planned and actual divisions of Poland, according to the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], with later adjustments|alt=Map showing the planned and actual divisions of Poland according to the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact.]]\n\nHowever, there was one exception: on the night of 25\u201326 August, a German sabotage group which had not heard anything about a delay of the invasion made an attack on the [[Jablunkov Pass]] and [[Mosty u Jablunkova|Mosty]] railway station in [[Silesia]]. On the morning of 26 August, this group was repelled by Polish troops. The German side described all this as an incident \"caused by an insane individual\" (see [[Jab\u0142onk\u00f3w incident]]).\n\nOn 26 August, Hitler tried to dissuade the British and the French from interfering in the upcoming conflict, even pledging that the ''Wehrmacht'' forces would be made available to Britain's empire in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/t295s04.html|title=Home \u2013 FDR Presidential Library & Museum}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/a295s04.html|title=Home \u2013 FDR Presidential Library & Museum}}</ref> The negotiations convinced Hitler that there was little chance the Western Allies would declare war on Germany, and even if they did, because of the lack of \"territorial guarantees\" to Poland, they would be willing to negotiate a compromise favourable to Germany after its conquest of Poland. Meanwhile, the increased number of overflights by high-altitude [[reconnaissance aircraft]] and cross-border troop movements signaled that war was imminent.\n[[File:Second World War Europe.png|right|thumb|The map shows the beginning of World War II in September 1939 in a European context.]]\n\nOn 29 August, prompted by the British, Germany issued one last diplomatic offer, with ''Fall Weiss'' yet to be rescheduled. That evening, the German government responded in a communication that it aimed not only for the restoration of Danzig but also the Polish Corridor (which had not previously been part of Hitler's demands) in addition to the safeguarding of the [[German minority in Poland]]. It said that they were willing to commence negotiations, but indicated that a Polish representative with the power to sign an agreement had to arrive in Berlin the next day while in the meantime it would draw up a set of proposals.<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/blbk78.asp Reply of the German Chancellor to the Communication of 28 August 1939, from His Majesty's Government] Cited in the British Blue Book</ref> The British Cabinet was pleased that negotiations had been agreed to but, mindful of how [[Emil H\u00e1cha]] had been [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|forced to sign his country away]] under similar circumstances just months earlier, regarded the requirement for an immediate arrival of a Polish representative with full signing powers as an unacceptable [[ultimatum]].<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/blbk81.asp Viscount Halifax to Sir N.

It was then broadcast that Poland had rejected Germany's offer, and negotiations with Poland came to an end. Hitler issued orders for the invasion to commence soon afterwards.\n\nOn 29 August, Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[J\u00f3zef Beck]] ordered military [[mobilization]], but under the pressure from Great Britain and France, the mobilization was cancelled. When the final mobilization started, it added to the confusion.<ref>Oslon and Cloud,\"A Question of Honor\" p. 50</ref>\n\nOn 30 August, the [[Polish Navy]] sent its destroyer [[flotilla]] to Britain, executing the [[Peking Plan]]. On the same day, [[Marshal of Poland]] [[Edward Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y]] announced the mobilization of Polish troops. However, he was pressured into revoking the order by the French, who apparently still hoped for a diplomatic settlement, failing to realize that the Germans were fully mobilized and concentrated at the Polish border.<ref>Seidner, Stanley S.

However, partly because of the earlier stoppage, Poland finally managed to mobilize only about 70% of its planned forces (only about 900,000 of 1,350,000 soldiers planned to mobilize in first order), and because of that many units were still forming or moving to their designated frontline positions. The late mobilization reduced combat capability of Polish Army by about 1/3.\n\n== Opposing forces ==\n{{See also|Opposing forces in the Polish September Campaign|Soviet order of battle for invasion of Poland in 1939|Slovak invasion of Poland}}\n\n=== Germany ===\n{{See also|German order of battle for the invasion of Poland}}\n\nGermany had a substantial numeric advantage over Poland and had developed a significant military before the conflict. The ''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]'' (army) had 3,472 [[tank]]s in its inventory, of which 2,859 were with the Field Army and 408 with the [[Replacement Army]].{{sfn|Jentz|1996|p=88}} 453 tanks were assigned into four light divisions, while another 225 tanks were in detached regiments and companies.{{sfn|Jentz|1996|p=91}}  Most notably, the Germans had seven ''[[Panzer]]'' divisions, with 2,009 tanks between them, utilizing a new [[operational doctrine]].{{sfn|Jentz|1996|pp=90\u201391}} It held that these divisions should act in coordination with other elements of the military, punching holes in the enemy line and isolating selected units, which would be [[Encirclement|encircled]] and destroyed. This would be followed up by less-mobile mechanized infantry and foot soldiers. The ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (air force) provided both tactical and strategic [[air power]], particularly [[dive bomber]]s that disrupted lines of supply and communications. Together, the new methods were nicknamed \"''[[Blitzkrieg]]''\" (lightning war). While historian [[Basil Liddell Hart]] claimed \"Poland was a full demonstration of the ''Blitzkrieg'' theory\",<ref>B.H. Hart & A.J.P.

[[Bomber aircraft|Bombers]] also attacked cities, causing huge losses amongst the civilian population through [[terror bombing]] and strafing. The ''Luftwaffe'' forces consisted of 1,180 [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]], 290 [[Junkers Ju 87|Ju 87 ''Stuka'']] [[dive bomber]]s, 1,100 conventional bombers (mainly [[Heinkel He 111]]s and [[Dornier Do 17]]s), and an assortment of 550 transport and 350 reconnaissance aircraft.<ref>Bombers of the Luftwaffe, Joachim Dressel and Manfred Griehl, Arms and Armour, 1994</ref><ref>The Flying pencil, Heinz J.

The partitioning powers did not invest in the development of industry, especially in the armaments industry in ethnically Polish areas. Moreover, Poland had to deal with damage caused by [[World War I]]. This resulted in the need to build a defense industry from scratch. Between 1936 and 1939, Poland invested heavily in the newly created [[Centralny Okr\u0119g Przemys\u0142owy|Central Industrial Region]]. Preparations for a defensive war with Germany were ongoing for many years, but most plans assumed fighting would not begin before 1942. To raise funds for industrial development, Poland sold much of the modern equipment it produced.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', p. 177</ref> In 1936, a [[Fundusz Obrony Narodowej|National Defence Fund]] was set up to collect funds necessary for strengthening the Polish Armed forces. The [[Polish Army]] had approximately a million soldiers, but not all were mobilized by 1 September. Latecomers sustained significant casualties when public transport became targets of the ''Luftwaffe''. The Polish military had fewer armored forces than the Germans, and these units, dispersed within the infantry, were unable to effectively engage the Germans.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 270\u201394</ref>\n\nExperiences in the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] shaped Polish Army organizational and operational doctrine. Unlike the [[trench warfare]] of [[World War I]], the Polish\u2013Soviet War was a conflict in which the [[cavalry]]'s mobility played a decisive role.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 135\u2013138</ref> Poland acknowledged the benefits of mobility but was unable to invest heavily in many of the expensive, unproven inventions since then.

It called for the start of hostilities before a [[declaration of war]], and pursued a doctrine of mass encirclement and destruction of enemy forces. The infantry\u2014far from completely mechanized but fitted with fast-moving artillery and logistic support\u2014was to be supported by ''Panzers'' and small numbers of truck-mounted infantry (the ''Sch\u00fctzen'' regiments, forerunners of the ''[[panzergrenadier]]s'') to assist the rapid movement of troops and concentrate on [[Schwerpunkt|localized parts]] of the enemy [[Military front|front]], eventually isolating segments of the enemy, surrounding, and destroying them. The pre-war \"armored idea\" (which an American journalist in 1939 dubbed ''Blitzkrieg'')\u2014which was advocated by some generals, including [[Heinz Guderian]]\u2014would have had the armor punching holes in the enemy's front and ranging deep into rear areas; in actuality, the campaign in Poland would be fought along more traditional lines. This stemmed from conservatism on the part of the German high command, who mainly restricted the role of armor and mechanized forces to supporting the conventional infantry divisions.\n\nPoland's terrain was well suited for mobile operations when the weather cooperated; the country had flat [[plain]]s with long frontiers totalling almost {{convert|5600|km|mi|abbr=on}}, Poland's long border with Germany on the west and north\u2014facing East Prussia\u2014extended {{convert|2000|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Those had been lengthened by another {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} on the southern side in the aftermath of the Munich Agreement of 1938. The German incorporation of [[Bohemia and Moravia]] and creation of the German [[puppet state]] of [[History of Slovakia#World War II|Slovakia]] meant that Poland's southern flank was also exposed.\n\nHitler demanded that Poland be conquered in six weeks, but German planners thought that it would require three months.<ref name=\"knickerbocker1941\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwGwpIBHhgcC&lpg=PR2&pg=PA29#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Is Tomorrow Hitler's? 200 Questions On the Battle of Mankind | publisher=Reynal & Hitchcock | author=Knickerbocker, H.R. | year=1941 | pages=29\u201330| isbn=978-1-4179-9277-5 }}</ref> They intended to fully exploit their long border with the great enveloping manoeuver of ''Fall Weiss''. German units were to invade Poland from three directions:\n* A main attack over the western Polish border. This was to be carried out by Army Group South commanded by Colonel General [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], attacking from German [[Silesia]] and from the [[Moravia]]n and Slovak border: General [[Johannes Blaskowitz]]'s 8th Army was to drive eastward against [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]; General [[Wilhelm List]]'s 14th Army was to push on toward [[Krak\u00f3w]] and to turn the Poles' [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] flank; and General [[Walter von Reichenau]]'s 10th Army, in the centre with Army Group South's armor, was to deliver the decisive blow with a northeastward thrust into the heart of Poland.\n* A second route of attack from northern [[Prussia]]. Colonel General [[Fedor von Bock]] commanded Army Group North, comprising General [[Georg von K\u00fcchler]]'s 3rd Army, which was to strike southward from East Prussia, and General [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge]]'s 4th Army, which was to attack eastward across the base of the [[Polish Corridor]].\n* A tertiary attack by part of Army Group South's allied [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovak]] units from Slovakia.\n* From within Poland, the German minority would assist by engaging in diversion and sabotage operations through ''[[Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz]]'' units prepared before the war.\n\nAll three assaults were to converge on [[Warsaw]], while the main Polish army was to be encircled and destroyed west of the [[Vistula]]. ''Fall Weiss'' was initiated on 1 September 1939, and was the first operation of [[European Theatre of World War II|Second World War in Europe]].\n\n=== Polish defence plan ===\n[[File:Dywizje wrzesien 1.png|thumb|right|Deployment of German, Polish, and Slovak divisions immediately before the German invasion.|alt=Map showing deployment of German, Polish, and Slovak divisions on 1 September 1939, immediately before the German invasion.]]\n\nThe Polish determination to deploy forces directly at the German-Polish border, prompted by the [[Polish-British Common Defence Pact]], shaped the country's defence plan, \"[[Plan West]]\". Poland's most valuable natural resources, industry and population were located along the western border in [[Silesian Voivodeship (1920\u20131939)|Eastern Upper Silesia]]. Polish policy centred on their protection especially since many politicians feared that if Poland were to retreat from the regions disputed by Germany, Britain and France would sign a separate peace treaty with Germany similar to the [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 68\u201372</ref> The fact that none of Poland's allies had specifically guaranteed Polish borders or [[territorial integrity]] didn't help in easing Polish concerns. For these reasons, the Polish government disregarded French advice to deploy the bulk of its forces behind natural barriers such as the [[Vistula]] and [[San (river)|San]] rivers, even though some Polish generals supported it as a better strategy. The West Plan did permit the Polish armies to retreat inside the country, but it was supposed to be a slow retreat behind prepared positions and was intended to give the armed forces time to complete its mobilization and execute a general [[counteroffensive]] with the support of the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]].<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 122\u201325</ref>\n\nIn the case of a failure to defend the most of the territory, the army was to retreat to the south-east of the country, where the rough terrain, the [[Stryi River|Stryj]] and [[Dniestr]] rivers, valleys, hills and swamps would provide natural lines of defence against the [[Nazi Germany|German]] advance and [[Romanian Bridgehead]] could be created.\n[[File:Polish P-11 camouflaged in airfield 1939.jpg|thumb|left|A camouflaged Polish P-11 fighter at a combat airfield|alt=A photo of a Polish P-11 fighter covered in camouflage netting at an unidentified combat airfield]]\n\nThe Polish General Staff had not begun elaborating the \"West\" defence plan until 4 March 1939. It was assumed that the Polish Army, fighting in the initial phase of the war alone, would be compelled to defend the western regions of the country. The plan of operations took into account, first of all, the numerical and material superiority of the enemy and, consequently, assumed the defensive character of Polish operations. The Polish intentions were: defence of the western regions judged as indispensable for waging the war, taking advantage of the propitious conditions for counterattacks by reserve units, and avoidance of being smashed before the beginning of Franco/British operations in Western Europe. The [[operation plan|operational plan]] had not been elaborated in detail and concerned only the first stage of operations.<ref name=\"Wojna Obronna\" />\n\nThe British and French estimated that Poland would be able to defend itself for two to three months, while Poland estimated it could do so for at least six months. While Poland drafted its estimates based upon the expectation that the Western Allies would honor their treaty obligations and quickly start an offensive of their own, the French and British expected the war to develop into [[trench warfare]] much like World War I. The Polish government was not notified of this strategy and based all of its defence plans on promises of quick relief by their Western allies.<ref name=\"Pi\u0105tkowski\">{{cite book | author =Henryk Pi\u0105tkowski | title =Kampania wrze\u015bniowa 1939 roku w Polsce | year =1943 | page =39 | publisher =Sekcja Wydawnicza APW | location =Jerusalem | url =http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~antora/WYDAW/KAMPANIA/tekst/KAMPANIA1.HTM | accessdate =2 November 2011 | language =pl | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20080209164014/http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~antora/WYDAW/KAMPANIA/tekst/KAMPANIA1.HTM | archive-date =9 February 2008 | url-status =dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Raczy\u0144ski\">{{cite book | author=Count [[Edward Raczy\u0144ski (1891\u20131993)|Edward Raczy\u0144ski]] | title = The British-Polish Alliance; Its Origin and Meaning | year =1948 | publisher=Mellville Press | location = London }}</ref>\n\nPolish forces were stretched thinly along the Polish-German border and lacked compact defence lines and good defence positions along disadvantageous terrain. This strategy also left [[supply line]]s poorly protected. One-third of Poland's forces were massed in or near the Polish Corridor, making them vulnerable to a [[Pincer movement|double envelopment]] from East Prussia and the west. Another third were concentrated in the north-central part of the country, between the major cities of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and Warsaw.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 304\u2013310</ref> The forward positioning of Polish forces vastly increased the difficulty of carrying out strategic maneuvers, compounded by inadequate mobility, as Polish units often lacked the ability to retreat from their defensive positions as they were being overrun by more mobile German mechanized formations.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n[[File:Peking.jpg|thumb|[[Peking Plan]]: Polish destroyers evacuate the Baltic Sea en route to the United Kingdom.|alt=Photo of three Polish destroyers executing the Peking Plan and evacuating to British before the start of the invasion.]]\n\nAs the prospect of conflict increased, the British government pressed Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz to evacuate the most modern elements of the Polish Navy from the Baltic Sea.<ref name=\"PN\" /> In the event of war the Polish military leaders realized that the ships which remained in the Baltic were likely to be quickly sunk by the Germans. Furthermore, the [[Danish straits]] were well within operating range of the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' and ''Luftwaffe'', so there was little chance of an evacuation plan succeeding if implemented after hostilities began. Four days after the signing of the Polish-British Common Defence Pact, three destroyers of the Polish Navy executed the Peking Plan and consequently evacuated to Great Britain.<ref name=\"PN\" />\n\nAlthough the Polish military had prepared for conflict, the civilian population remained largely unprepared. Polish pre-war [[propaganda]] emphasized that any German invasion would be easily repelled. Consequently, Polish defeats during the German invasion came as a shock to the civilian population.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Lacking training for such a disaster, the civilian population panicked and retreated east, spreading chaos, lowering troop morale and making road transportation for Polish troops very difficult.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> The propaganda also had some negative consequences for the Polish troops themselves, whose communications, disrupted by German mobile units operating in the rear and civilians blocking roads, were further thrown into chaos by bizarre reports from Polish radio stations and newspapers, which often reported imaginary victories and other military operations. This led to some Polish troops being encircled or taking a stand against overwhelming odds, when they thought they were actually counterattacking or would soon receive reinforcements from other victorious areas.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n=== Phase 1: German invasion ===\n[[File:Poland2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Map showing the advances made by the Germans, and the disposition of all troops from 1 to 14 September|alt=Map showing the advance made by the Germans, and the disposition of German and Polish troops on 14 September 1939.]]\n\nFollowing several German-staged incidents (like the Gleiwitz incident, a part of [[Operation Himmler]]), which German propaganda used as a [[pretext]] to claim that German forces were acting in [[self-defence]], one of the first acts of war took place on 1 September 1939. At 04:45, the old German [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] ''[[German battleship Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig-Holstein]]'' opened fire on the Polish military transit depot at [[Battle of Westerplatte|Westerplatte]] in the Free City of Danzig on the [[Baltic Sea]]. However, in many places German units crossed the Polish border even before 04.45. Around that time Luftwaffe attacked a number of military and civilian targets, including [[bombing of Wielu\u0144]], the first large scale city bombing of the war. At 08:00, German troops\u2014still without a formal declaration of war issued\u2014[[Battle of Mokra|attacked near the Polish village of Mokra]]. The [[Battle of the Border]] had begun. Later that day, the Germans attacked on Poland's western, southern and northern borders, while German aircraft began raids on Polish cities. The main axis of attack led eastwards from Germany through the western Polish border. Supporting attacks came from East Prussia in the north, and a joint German-Slovak tertiary attack by units ([[Field Army Bernol\u00e1k|Field Army \"Bernol\u00e1k\"]]) from the German-allied Slovak Republic in the south. All three assaults converged on the Polish capital of Warsaw.\n[[File:Zniszczenia1939 0.jpg|thumb|left|The city of [[Wielu\u0144]] destroyed by ''Luftwaffe'' bombing|alt=Aerial photo showing the city of Wielu\u0144, which was destroyed by ''Luftwaffe'' bombing on 1 September]]\n\nFrance and the UK declared war on Germany on 3 September, but [[Western betrayal|failed to provide any meaningful support]].

Despite some Polish successes in minor border battles, German technical, operational and numerical superiority forced the Polish armies to retreat from the borders towards Warsaw and [[Lw\u00f3w]]. The ''Luftwaffe'' gained [[air superiority]] early in the campaign. By destroying communications, the ''Luftwaffe'' increased the pace of the advance which overran Polish airstrips and early warning sites, causing logistical problems for the Poles.

It would be months before Hitler would see the futility of his peace negotiation attempts with the United Kingdom and France, but the culmination of combined European and Pacific conflicts would result in what was truly a \"world war\". Thus, what was not seen by most politicians and generals in 1939 is clear from the historical perspective: The Polish September Campaign marked the beginning of a pan-European war, which combined with the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]] in 1937 and the [[Pacific War]] in 1941 to form the global conflict known as World War II.\n\nThe invasion of Poland led Britain and France to declare war on Germany on 3 September. However, they did little to affect the outcome of the September Campaign. No declaration of war was issued by Britain and France against the Soviet Union. This lack of direct help led many Poles to believe that they had been [[Western betrayal#Up to 1939|betrayed by their Western allies]].

Polish cavalry consisted of 11 [[brigade]]s, equipped with [[Anti-tank rifle, model 35|\"UR\" anti-tank rifles]] and light artillery such as the highly effective [[Bofors 37 mm]] anti-tank gun.

The Polish Air Force, despite being significantly outnumbered and with its fighters outmatched by more advanced German fighters, remained active until the second week of the campaign, inflicting significant damage on the ''Luftwaffe''.<ref>Steven J.

Visible shattered window.]]\n\n=== First use of ''Blitzkrieg'' strategy ===\nIt is often assumed that '' Blitzkrieg'' is the strategy that Germany first used in Poland. Many early post-war histories, such as Barrie Pitt's in ''The Second World War'' (BPC Publishing 1966), attribute German victory to \"enormous development in military technique which occurred between 1918 and 1940\", and cite that \"Germany, who translated (British inter-war) theories into action... called the result ''Blitzkrieg''\". That idea has been repudiated by some authors. Matthew Cooper writes:\n\n{{quote|\"Throughout the Polish Campaign, the employment of the mechanized units revealed the idea that they were intended solely to ease the advance and to support the activities of the infantry.... Thus, any strategic exploitation of the armoured idea was still-born. The paralysis of command and the breakdown of morale were not made the ultimate aim of the{{nbs}}... German ground and air forces, and were only incidental by-products of the traditional manoeuvers of rapid encirclement and of the supporting activities of the flying artillery of the ''Luftwaffe'', both of which had as their purpose the physical destruction of the enemy troops. Such was the ''[[Vernichtungsgedanke]]'' of the Polish campaign.\" \u2013 Cooper<ref name=\"Cooper176\" />|sign=|source=}}\n\n''[[Vernichtungsgedanke]]'' was a strategy dating back to [[Frederick the Great]], and it was applied in the Polish Campaign, little changed from the [[Franco-Prussian War|French campaigns in 1870]] or 1914. The use of [[tank]]s\n\n{{quote|...left much to be desired... Fear of enemy action against the flanks of the advance, fear which was to prove so disastrous to German prospects in the west in 1940 and in the Soviet Union in 1941, was present from the beginning of the war. \u2013 Cooper<ref name=Cooper0 />}}\n\nJohn Ellis, writing in ''[[Brute Force (book)|Brute Force]]'', asserted that\n\n{{quote|...there is considerable justice in Matthew Cooper's assertion that the ''panzer'' divisions were not given the kind of ''strategic'' mission that was to characterize authentic armoured ''blitzkrieg'', and were almost always closely subordinated to the various mass infantry armies. \u2013 Ellis<ref>Ellis, John (1999). ''Brute Force: Allied Strategy and Tactics in the Second World War'', pp. 3\u20134</ref> (emphasis in original)}}\n\nZaloga and Madej, in ''The Polish Campaign 1939'', also address the subject of mythical interpretations of ''Blitzkrieg'' and the importance of other arms in the campaign. Western accounts of the September campaign have stressed the shock value of the ''panzers'' and ''Stuka'' attacks, they have\n\n{{quote|...tended to underestimate the punishing effect of German artillery on Polish units. Mobile and available in significant quantity, artillery shattered as many units as any other branch of the ''Wehrmacht''. \u2013 Zaloga and Madej<ref name=\"Cooper4\" />}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Eastern Front (World War II)]]\n* [[Polish resistance movement in World War II]]\n* [[History of Poland (1939\u20131945)]]\n* [[Horses in World War II]]\n* [[List of Polish divisions in World War II]]\n* [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)]]\n* [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]]\n* [[Phoney War]]\n* [[Polish cavalry brigade order of battle in 1939]]\n* [[Polish contribution to World War II]]\n* [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)]]\n* [[Timeline of the invasion of Poland]]\n* [[War crimes of the Wehrmacht]]\n* [[Western betrayal]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n== References ==\n<!--This article uses the Cite.php citation mechanism.

Talks over Danzig and the Corridor broke down and months passed without diplomatic interaction between Germany and Poland. During this interim period, the Germans learned that France and Britain had failed to secure an alliance with the Soviet Union against Germany, and that the Soviet Union was interested in an alliance with Germany against Poland. Hitler had already issued orders to prepare for a possible \"solution of the Polish problem by military means\" through the [[Fall Weiss (1939)|Case White]] scenario.\n\nIn May 1939, in a statement to his generals while they were in the midst of planning the invasion of Poland, Hitler made it clear that the invasion would not come without resistance as it had in Czechoslovakia:<ref name=\"Clark, Lloyd 2011, page 26\">Clark, Lloyd, ''Kursk: The Greatest Battle: Eastern Front 1943'', 2011, p. 26</ref>\n\n{{quote|With minor exceptions German national unification has been achieved.

In fact, the Soviets agreed not to aid France or the UK in the event of their going to war with Germany over Poland and, in a secret protocol of the pact, the Germans and the Soviets agreed to divide Eastern Europe, including Poland, into two [[spheres of influence]]; the western one-third of the country was to go to Germany and the eastern two-thirds to the Soviet Union.\n\nThe German assault was originally scheduled to begin at 04:00 on 26 August. However, on 25 August, the [[Polish-British Common Defence Pact]] was signed as an annex to the [[Franco-Polish alliance (1921)]]. In this accord, Britain committed itself to the defence of Poland, guaranteeing to preserve Polish independence. At the same time, the British and the Poles were hinting to Berlin that they were willing to resume discussions\u2014not at all how Hitler hoped to frame the conflict. Thus, he wavered and postponed his attack until 1 September, managing to in effect halt the entire invasion \"in mid-leap\".\n[[File:Ribbentrop-Molotov.svg|thumb|left|Planned and actual divisions of Poland, according to the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], with later adjustments|alt=Map showing the planned and actual divisions of Poland according to the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact.]]\n\nHowever, there was one exception: on the night of 25\u201326 August, a German sabotage group which had not heard anything about a delay of the invasion made an attack on the [[Jablunkov Pass]] and [[Mosty u Jablunkova|Mosty]] railway station in [[Silesia]]. On the morning of 26 August, this group was repelled by Polish troops. The German side described all this as an incident \"caused by an insane individual\" (see [[Jab\u0142onk\u00f3w incident]]).\n\nOn 26 August, Hitler tried to dissuade the British and the French from interfering in the upcoming conflict, even pledging that the ''Wehrmacht'' forces would be made available to Britain's empire in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/t295s04.html|title=Home \u2013 FDR Presidential Library & Museum}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/a295s04.html|title=Home \u2013 FDR Presidential Library & Museum}}</ref> The negotiations convinced Hitler that there was little chance the Western Allies would declare war on Germany, and even if they did, because of the lack of \"territorial guarantees\" to Poland, they would be willing to negotiate a compromise favourable to Germany after its conquest of Poland. Meanwhile, the increased number of overflights by high-altitude [[reconnaissance aircraft]] and cross-border troop movements signaled that war was imminent.\n[[File:Second World War Europe.png|right|thumb|The map shows the beginning of World War II in September 1939 in a European context.]]\n\nOn 29 August, prompted by the British, Germany issued one last diplomatic offer, with ''Fall Weiss'' yet to be rescheduled. That evening, the German government responded in a communication that it aimed not only for the restoration of Danzig but also the Polish Corridor (which had not previously been part of Hitler's demands) in addition to the safeguarding of the [[German minority in Poland]]. It said that they were willing to commence negotiations, but indicated that a Polish representative with the power to sign an agreement had to arrive in Berlin the next day while in the meantime it would draw up a set of proposals.<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/blbk78.asp Reply of the German Chancellor to the Communication of 28 August 1939, from His Majesty's Government] Cited in the British Blue Book</ref> The British Cabinet was pleased that negotiations had been agreed to but, mindful of how [[Emil H\u00e1cha]] had been [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|forced to sign his country away]] under similar circumstances just months earlier, regarded the requirement for an immediate arrival of a Polish representative with full signing powers as an unacceptable [[ultimatum]].<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/blbk81.asp Viscount Halifax to Sir N.

Hitler issued orders for the invasion to commence soon afterwards.\n\nOn 29 August, Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[J\u00f3zef Beck]] ordered military [[mobilization]], but under the pressure from Great Britain and France, the mobilization was cancelled. When the final mobilization started, it added to the confusion.<ref>Oslon and Cloud,\"A Question of Honor\" p. 50</ref>\n\nOn 30 August, the [[Polish Navy]] sent its destroyer [[flotilla]] to Britain, executing the [[Peking Plan]]. On the same day, [[Marshal of Poland]] [[Edward Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y]] announced the mobilization of Polish troops. However, he was pressured into revoking the order by the French, who apparently still hoped for a diplomatic settlement, failing to realize that the Germans were fully mobilized and concentrated at the Polish border.<ref>Seidner, Stanley S.

However, partly because of the earlier stoppage, Poland finally managed to mobilize only about 70% of its planned forces (only about 900,000 of 1,350,000 soldiers planned to mobilize in first order), and because of that many units were still forming or moving to their designated frontline positions.

This would be followed up by less-mobile mechanized infantry and foot soldiers. The ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (air force) provided both tactical and strategic [[air power]], particularly [[dive bomber]]s that disrupted lines of supply and communications. Together, the new methods were nicknamed \"''[[Blitzkrieg]]''\" (lightning war). While historian [[Basil Liddell Hart]] claimed \"Poland was a full demonstration of the ''Blitzkrieg'' theory\",<ref>B.H. Hart & A.J.P.

[[Bomber aircraft|Bombers]] also attacked cities, causing huge losses amongst the civilian population through [[terror bombing]] and strafing. The ''Luftwaffe'' forces consisted of 1,180 [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]], 290 [[Junkers Ju 87|Ju 87 ''Stuka'']] [[dive bomber]]s, 1,100 conventional bombers (mainly [[Heinkel He 111]]s and [[Dornier Do 17]]s), and an assortment of 550 transport and 350 reconnaissance aircraft.<ref>Bombers of the Luftwaffe, Joachim Dressel and Manfred Griehl, Arms and Armour, 1994</ref><ref>The Flying pencil, Heinz J.

The partitioning powers did not invest in the development of industry, especially in the armaments industry in ethnically Polish areas. Moreover, Poland had to deal with damage caused by [[World War I]]. This resulted in the need to build a defense industry from scratch. Between 1936 and 1939, Poland invested heavily in the newly created [[Centralny Okr\u0119g Przemys\u0142owy|Central Industrial Region]]. Preparations for a defensive war with Germany were ongoing for many years, but most plans assumed fighting would not begin before 1942. To raise funds for industrial development, Poland sold much of the modern equipment it produced.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', p. 177</ref> In 1936, a [[Fundusz Obrony Narodowej|National Defence Fund]] was set up to collect funds necessary for strengthening the Polish Armed forces. The [[Polish Army]] had approximately a million soldiers, but not all were mobilized by 1 September. Latecomers sustained significant casualties when public transport became targets of the ''Luftwaffe''. The Polish military had fewer armored forces than the Germans, and these units, dispersed within the infantry, were unable to effectively engage the Germans.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 270\u201394</ref>\n\nExperiences in the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] shaped Polish Army organizational and operational doctrine. Unlike the [[trench warfare]] of [[World War I]], the Polish\u2013Soviet War was a conflict in which the [[cavalry]]'s mobility played a decisive role.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 135\u2013138</ref> Poland acknowledged the benefits of mobility but was unable to invest heavily in many of the expensive, unproven inventions since then.

It called for the start of hostilities before a [[declaration of war]], and pursued a doctrine of mass encirclement and destruction of enemy forces. The infantry\u2014far from completely mechanized but fitted with fast-moving artillery and logistic support\u2014was to be supported by ''Panzers'' and small numbers of truck-mounted infantry (the ''Sch\u00fctzen'' regiments, forerunners of the ''[[panzergrenadier]]s'') to assist the rapid movement of troops and concentrate on [[Schwerpunkt|localized parts]] of the enemy [[Military front|front]], eventually isolating segments of the enemy, surrounding, and destroying them. The pre-war \"armored idea\" (which an American journalist in 1939 dubbed ''Blitzkrieg'')\u2014which was advocated by some generals, including [[Heinz Guderian]]\u2014would have had the armor punching holes in the enemy's front and ranging deep into rear areas; in actuality, the campaign in Poland would be fought along more traditional lines. This stemmed from conservatism on the part of the German high command, who mainly restricted the role of armor and mechanized forces to supporting the conventional infantry divisions.\n\nPoland's terrain was well suited for mobile operations when the weather cooperated; the country had flat [[plain]]s with long frontiers totalling almost {{convert|5600|km|mi|abbr=on}}, Poland's long border with Germany on the west and north\u2014facing East Prussia\u2014extended {{convert|2000|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Those had been lengthened by another {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} on the southern side in the aftermath of the Munich Agreement of 1938. The German incorporation of [[Bohemia and Moravia]] and creation of the German [[puppet state]] of [[History of Slovakia#World War II|Slovakia]] meant that Poland's southern flank was also exposed.\n\nHitler demanded that Poland be conquered in six weeks, but German planners thought that it would require three months.<ref name=\"knickerbocker1941\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwGwpIBHhgcC&lpg=PR2&pg=PA29#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Is Tomorrow Hitler's? 200 Questions On the Battle of Mankind | publisher=Reynal & Hitchcock | author=Knickerbocker, H.R. | year=1941 | pages=29\u201330| isbn=978-1-4179-9277-5 }}</ref> They intended to fully exploit their long border with the great enveloping manoeuver of ''Fall Weiss''. German units were to invade Poland from three directions:\n* A main attack over the western Polish border. This was to be carried out by Army Group South commanded by Colonel General [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], attacking from German [[Silesia]] and from the [[Moravia]]n and Slovak border: General [[Johannes Blaskowitz]]'s 8th Army was to drive eastward against [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]; General [[Wilhelm List]]'s 14th Army was to push on toward [[Krak\u00f3w]] and to turn the Poles' [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] flank; and General [[Walter von Reichenau]]'s 10th Army, in the centre with Army Group South's armor, was to deliver the decisive blow with a northeastward thrust into the heart of Poland.\n* A second route of attack from northern [[Prussia]]. Colonel General [[Fedor von Bock]] commanded Army Group North, comprising General [[Georg von K\u00fcchler]]'s 3rd Army, which was to strike southward from East Prussia, and General [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge]]'s 4th Army, which was to attack eastward across the base of the [[Polish Corridor]].\n* A tertiary attack by part of Army Group South's allied [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovak]] units from Slovakia.\n* From within Poland, the German minority would assist by engaging in diversion and sabotage operations through ''[[Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz]]'' units prepared before the war.\n\nAll three assaults were to converge on [[Warsaw]], while the main Polish army was to be encircled and destroyed west of the [[Vistula]]. ''Fall Weiss'' was initiated on 1 September 1939, and was the first operation of [[European Theatre of World War II|Second World War in Europe]].\n\n=== Polish defence plan ===\n[[File:Dywizje wrzesien 1.png|thumb|right|Deployment of German, Polish, and Slovak divisions immediately before the German invasion.|alt=Map showing deployment of German, Polish, and Slovak divisions on 1 September 1939, immediately before the German invasion.]]\n\nThe Polish determination to deploy forces directly at the German-Polish border, prompted by the [[Polish-British Common Defence Pact]], shaped the country's defence plan, \"[[Plan West]]\". Poland's most valuable natural resources, industry and population were located along the western border in [[Silesian Voivodeship (1920\u20131939)|Eastern Upper Silesia]]. Polish policy centred on their protection especially since many politicians feared that if Poland were to retreat from the regions disputed by Germany, Britain and France would sign a separate peace treaty with Germany similar to the [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 68\u201372</ref> The fact that none of Poland's allies had specifically guaranteed Polish borders or [[territorial integrity]] didn't help in easing Polish concerns. For these reasons, the Polish government disregarded French advice to deploy the bulk of its forces behind natural barriers such as the [[Vistula]] and [[San (river)|San]] rivers, even though some Polish generals supported it as a better strategy. The West Plan did permit the Polish armies to retreat inside the country, but it was supposed to be a slow retreat behind prepared positions and was intended to give the armed forces time to complete its mobilization and execute a general [[counteroffensive]] with the support of the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]].<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 122\u201325</ref>\n\nIn the case of a failure to defend the most of the territory, the army was to retreat to the south-east of the country, where the rough terrain, the [[Stryi River|Stryj]] and [[Dniestr]] rivers, valleys, hills and swamps would provide natural lines of defence against the [[Nazi Germany|German]] advance and [[Romanian Bridgehead]] could be created.\n[[File:Polish P-11 camouflaged in airfield 1939.jpg|thumb|left|A camouflaged Polish P-11 fighter at a combat airfield|alt=A photo of a Polish P-11 fighter covered in camouflage netting at an unidentified combat airfield]]\n\nThe Polish General Staff had not begun elaborating the \"West\" defence plan until 4 March 1939. It was assumed that the Polish Army, fighting in the initial phase of the war alone, would be compelled to defend the western regions of the country. The plan of operations took into account, first of all, the numerical and material superiority of the enemy and, consequently, assumed the defensive character of Polish operations. The Polish intentions were: defence of the western regions judged as indispensable for waging the war, taking advantage of the propitious conditions for counterattacks by reserve units, and avoidance of being smashed before the beginning of Franco/British operations in Western Europe. The [[operation plan|operational plan]] had not been elaborated in detail and concerned only the first stage of operations.<ref name=\"Wojna Obronna\" />\n\nThe British and French estimated that Poland would be able to defend itself for two to three months, while Poland estimated it could do so for at least six months. While Poland drafted its estimates based upon the expectation that the Western Allies would honor their treaty obligations and quickly start an offensive of their own, the French and British expected the war to develop into [[trench warfare]] much like World War I. The Polish government was not notified of this strategy and based all of its defence plans on promises of quick relief by their Western allies.<ref name=\"Pi\u0105tkowski\">{{cite book | author =Henryk Pi\u0105tkowski | title =Kampania wrze\u015bniowa 1939 roku w Polsce | year =1943 | page =39 | publisher =Sekcja Wydawnicza APW | location =Jerusalem | url =http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~antora/WYDAW/KAMPANIA/tekst/KAMPANIA1.HTM | accessdate =2 November 2011 | language =pl | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20080209164014/http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~antora/WYDAW/KAMPANIA/tekst/KAMPANIA1.HTM | archive-date =9 February 2008 | url-status =dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Raczy\u0144ski\">{{cite book | author=Count [[Edward Raczy\u0144ski (1891\u20131993)|Edward Raczy\u0144ski]] | title = The British-Polish Alliance; Its Origin and Meaning | year =1948 | publisher=Mellville Press | location = London }}</ref>\n\nPolish forces were stretched thinly along the Polish-German border and lacked compact defence lines and good defence positions along disadvantageous terrain. This strategy also left [[supply line]]s poorly protected. One-third of Poland's forces were massed in or near the Polish Corridor, making them vulnerable to a [[Pincer movement|double envelopment]] from East Prussia and the west. Another third were concentrated in the north-central part of the country, between the major cities of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and Warsaw.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 304\u2013310</ref> The forward positioning of Polish forces vastly increased the difficulty of carrying out strategic maneuvers, compounded by inadequate mobility, as Polish units often lacked the ability to retreat from their defensive positions as they were being overrun by more mobile German mechanized formations.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n[[File:Peking.jpg|thumb|[[Peking Plan]]: Polish destroyers evacuate the Baltic Sea en route to the United Kingdom.|alt=Photo of three Polish destroyers executing the Peking Plan and evacuating to British before the start of the invasion.]]\n\nAs the prospect of conflict increased, the British government pressed Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz to evacuate the most modern elements of the Polish Navy from the Baltic Sea.<ref name=\"PN\" /> In the event of war the Polish military leaders realized that the ships which remained in the Baltic were likely to be quickly sunk by the Germans. Furthermore, the [[Danish straits]] were well within operating range of the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' and ''Luftwaffe'', so there was little chance of an evacuation plan succeeding if implemented after hostilities began. Four days after the signing of the Polish-British Common Defence Pact, three destroyers of the Polish Navy executed the Peking Plan and consequently evacuated to Great Britain.<ref name=\"PN\" />\n\nAlthough the Polish military had prepared for conflict, the civilian population remained largely unprepared. Polish pre-war [[propaganda]] emphasized that any German invasion would be easily repelled. Consequently, Polish defeats during the German invasion came as a shock to the civilian population.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Lacking training for such a disaster, the civilian population panicked and retreated east, spreading chaos, lowering troop morale and making road transportation for Polish troops very difficult.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> The propaganda also had some negative consequences for the Polish troops themselves, whose communications, disrupted by German mobile units operating in the rear and civilians blocking roads, were further thrown into chaos by bizarre reports from Polish radio stations and newspapers, which often reported imaginary victories and other military operations. This led to some Polish troops being encircled or taking a stand against overwhelming odds, when they thought they were actually counterattacking or would soon receive reinforcements from other victorious areas.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n=== Phase 1: German invasion ===\n[[File:Poland2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Map showing the advances made by the Germans, and the disposition of all troops from 1 to 14 September|alt=Map showing the advance made by the Germans, and the disposition of German and Polish troops on 14 September 1939.]]\n\nFollowing several German-staged incidents (like the Gleiwitz incident, a part of [[Operation Himmler]]), which German propaganda used as a [[pretext]] to claim that German forces were acting in [[self-defence]], one of the first acts of war took place on 1 September 1939. At 04:45, the old German [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] ''[[German battleship Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig-Holstein]]'' opened fire on the Polish military transit depot at [[Battle of Westerplatte|Westerplatte]] in the Free City of Danzig on the [[Baltic Sea]]. However, in many places German units crossed the Polish border even before 04.45. Around that time Luftwaffe attacked a number of military and civilian targets, including [[bombing of Wielu\u0144]], the first large scale city bombing of the war. At 08:00, German troops\u2014still without a formal declaration of war issued\u2014[[Battle of Mokra|attacked near the Polish village of Mokra]]. The [[Battle of the Border]] had begun. Later that day, the Germans attacked on Poland's western, southern and northern borders, while German aircraft began raids on Polish cities. The main axis of attack led eastwards from Germany through the western Polish border. Supporting attacks came from East Prussia in the north, and a joint German-Slovak tertiary attack by units ([[Field Army Bernol\u00e1k|Field Army \"Bernol\u00e1k\"]]) from the German-allied Slovak Republic in the south. All three assaults converged on the Polish capital of Warsaw.\n[[File:Zniszczenia1939 0.jpg|thumb|left|The city of [[Wielu\u0144]] destroyed by ''Luftwaffe'' bombing|alt=Aerial photo showing the city of Wielu\u0144, which was destroyed by ''Luftwaffe'' bombing on 1 September]]\n\nFrance and the UK declared war on Germany on 3 September, but [[Western betrayal|failed to provide any meaningful support]].

Despite some Polish successes in minor border battles, German technical, operational and numerical superiority forced the Polish armies to retreat from the borders towards Warsaw and [[Lw\u00f3w]]. The ''Luftwaffe'' gained [[air superiority]] early in the campaign. By destroying communications, the ''Luftwaffe'' increased the pace of the advance which overran Polish airstrips and early warning sites, causing logistical problems for the Poles.

It would be months before Hitler would see the futility of his peace negotiation attempts with the United Kingdom and France, but the culmination of combined European and Pacific conflicts would result in what was truly a \"world war\". Thus, what was not seen by most politicians and generals in 1939 is clear from the historical perspective: The Polish September Campaign marked the beginning of a pan-European war, which combined with the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]] in 1937 and the [[Pacific War]] in 1941 to form the global conflict known as World War II.\n\nThe invasion of Poland led Britain and France to declare war on Germany on 3 September. However, they did little to affect the outcome of the September Campaign. No declaration of war was issued by Britain and France against the Soviet Union. This lack of direct help led many Poles to believe that they had been [[Western betrayal#Up to 1939|betrayed by their Western allies]].

Polish cavalry consisted of 11 [[brigade]]s, equipped with [[Anti-tank rifle, model 35|\"UR\" anti-tank rifles]] and light artillery such as the highly effective [[Bofors 37 mm]] anti-tank gun.

The Polish Air Force, despite being significantly outnumbered and with its fighters outmatched by more advanced German fighters, remained active until the second week of the campaign, inflicting significant damage on the ''Luftwaffe''.<ref>Steven J.

Visible shattered window.]]\n\n=== First use of ''Blitzkrieg'' strategy ===\nIt is often assumed that '' Blitzkrieg'' is the strategy that Germany first used in Poland. Many early post-war histories, such as Barrie Pitt's in ''The Second World War'' (BPC Publishing 1966), attribute German victory to \"enormous development in military technique which occurred between 1918 and 1940\", and cite that \"Germany, who translated (British inter-war) theories into action... called the result ''Blitzkrieg''\". That idea has been repudiated by some authors. Matthew Cooper writes:\n\n{{quote|\"Throughout the Polish Campaign, the employment of the mechanized units revealed the idea that they were intended solely to ease the advance and to support the activities of the infantry.... Thus, any strategic exploitation of the armoured idea was still-born. The paralysis of command and the breakdown of morale were not made the ultimate aim of the{{nbs}}... German ground and air forces, and were only incidental by-products of the traditional manoeuvers of rapid encirclement and of the supporting activities of the flying artillery of the ''Luftwaffe'', both of which had as their purpose the physical destruction of the enemy troops. Such was the ''[[Vernichtungsgedanke]]'' of the Polish campaign.\" \u2013 Cooper<ref name=\"Cooper176\" />|sign=|source=}}\n\n''[[Vernichtungsgedanke]]'' was a strategy dating back to [[Frederick the Great]], and it was applied in the Polish Campaign, little changed from the [[Franco-Prussian War|French campaigns in 1870]] or 1914. The use of [[tank]]s\n\n{{quote|...left much to be desired... Fear of enemy action against the flanks of the advance, fear which was to prove so disastrous to German prospects in the west in 1940 and in the Soviet Union in 1941, was present from the beginning of the war. \u2013 Cooper<ref name=Cooper0 />}}\n\nJohn Ellis, writing in ''[[Brute Force (book)|Brute Force]]'', asserted that\n\n{{quote|...there is considerable justice in Matthew Cooper's assertion that the ''panzer'' divisions were not given the kind of ''strategic'' mission that was to characterize authentic armoured ''blitzkrieg'', and were almost always closely subordinated to the various mass infantry armies. \u2013 Ellis<ref>Ellis, John (1999). ''Brute Force: Allied Strategy and Tactics in the Second World War'', pp. 3\u20134</ref> (emphasis in original)}}\n\nZaloga and Madej, in ''The Polish Campaign 1939'', also address the subject of mythical interpretations of ''Blitzkrieg'' and the importance of other arms in the campaign. Western accounts of the September campaign have stressed the shock value of the ''panzers'' and ''Stuka'' attacks, they have\n\n{{quote|...tended to underestimate the punishing effect of German artillery on Polish units. Mobile and available in significant quantity, artillery shattered as many units as any other branch of the ''Wehrmacht''. \u2013 Zaloga and Madej<ref name=\"Cooper4\" />}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Eastern Front (World War II)]]\n* [[Polish resistance movement in World War II]]\n* [[History of Poland (1939\u20131945)]]\n* [[Horses in World War II]]\n* [[List of Polish divisions in World War II]]\n* [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)]]\n* [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]]\n* [[Phoney War]]\n* [[Polish cavalry brigade order of battle in 1939]]\n* [[Polish contribution to World War II]]\n* [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)]]\n* [[Timeline of the invasion of Poland]]\n* [[War crimes of the Wehrmacht]]\n* [[Western betrayal]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n== References ==\n<!--This article uses the Cite.php citation mechanism.

During this season, Slutsk were suffering from financial difficulties and the fan group raised money to help the club.<ref name='\u0412 \u0410\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0438 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u044e\u0442 \u0437\u0430 \u0424\u041a \"\u0421\u043b\u0443\u0446\u043a\" \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0433\u0438'>{{cite web |title=\u0412 \u0410\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0438 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u044e\u0442 \u0437\u0430 \u0424\u041a \"\u0421\u043b\u0443\u0446\u043a\" \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0433\u0438 |url=https://euroradio.fm/ru/v-avstralii-boleyut-za-fk-sluck-i-sobirayut-dlya-nego-dengi |website=euroradio.fm |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref> As a thank you to the fans, the club displayed a banner at their stadium.<ref name=\"SFC Slutsk @ Facebook\">{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/SFC.Slutsk.1998/posts/112691193730899 |website=SFC Slutsk @ Facebook |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Current squad==\n''As of March 2020 ''<ref>[http://sfc-slutsk.by/club/teams/main FC Slutsk squad]</ref>\n\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no=4|name=[[Vitali Trubila]]|nat=BLR|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=7|name=[[Yuriy Teterenko]]|nat=UKR|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=8|name=[[Yegor Semenov]]|nat=BLR|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=9|name=[[Artyom Serdyuk]]|nat=RUS|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=10|name=[[Soslan Takulov]]|nat=RUS|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=11|name=[[Vladislav Sychev]]|nat=BLR|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=12|name=[[Pavel Zuyevich]]|nat=BLR|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=17|name=[[Umar Bala Mohammed]]|nat=NGA|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=18|name=[[Souleymane Koanda]]|nat=BFA|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=20|name=[[Dzyanis Obrazaw]]|nat=BLR|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=22|name=[[Yevgeniy Velko]]|nat=BLR|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=23|name=[[Igor Bobko]]|nat=BLR|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=24|name=[[Yury Kazlow]]|nat=BLR|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=25|name=[[Serhiy Chebotayev]]|nat=UKR|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=30|name=[[Ilya Branovets]]|nat=BLR|pos=GK}}\n{{Fs player|no=34|name=[[Barys Pankrataw]]|nat=BLR|pos=GK}}\n{{Fs player|no=55|name=[[Alyaksandr Anyukevich]]|nat=BLR|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=59|name=[[Roman Krivulkin]]|nat=BLR|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=71|name=[[Marat Burayev]]|nat=RUS|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=77|name=[[Alan Koroyev]]|nat=RUS|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=78|name=[[Abdoul Gafar Sirima]]|nat=BFA|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=99|name=[[Dramane Salou]]|nat=BFA|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n==League and Cup history==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!width=55|Season\n!width=50|{{Tooltip|Level|League level}}\n!width=30|{{Tooltip|Pos|Position}}\n!width=30|{{Tooltip|Pld|Played}}\n!width=30|{{Tooltip|W|Won}}\n!width=30|{{Tooltip|D|Drawn}}\n!width=30|{{Tooltip|L|Lost}}\n!width=60|Goals\n!width=45|Points\n![[Belarusian Cup|Domestic Cup]]\n!Notes\n|-\n| 2008 ||style=\"background:#A3E9FF\"| 3rd || '''5''' || 30 || 15 || 6 || 9 || 53\u201337 || '''51''' || || \n|-\n| 2009 ||style=\"background:#A3E9FF\"| 3rd || '''4''' || 26 || 14 || 3 || 9 || 48\u201337 || '''45''' ||Round of 64 || \n|-\n| 2010 ||style=\"background:#A3E9FF\"| 3rd || '''2''' || 34 || 25 || 6 || 3 || 79\u201330 || '''81''' ||Round of 32 || Promoted\n|-\n| 2011 ||style=\"background:#D0F0C0\"| 2nd || '''5''' || 30 || 13 || 10 || 7 || 44\u201333 || '''49''' ||Round of 32  || \n|-\n| 2012 ||style=\"background:#D0F0C0\"| 2nd || '''5''' || 28 || 15 || 7 || 6 || 59\u201327 || '''52''' ||Round of 32  ||\n|-\n| 2013 ||style=\"background:#D0F0C0\"| 2nd || '''1''' || 30 || 19 || 9 || 2 || 54\u201319 || '''66''' ||Round of 32  || Promoted\n|-\n| 2014 || 1st || '''9''' || 32 || 11 || 7 || 14 || 26\u201334 || '''40''' ||Round of 16  ||\n|-\n| 2015 || 1st || '''11''' || 26 || 6 || 7 || 13 || 26-30 || '''25''' ||Round of 16  ||\n|-\n| 2016 || 1st || '''12''' || 30 || 6 || 12 || 12 || 22-34 || '''30''' || Quarter-finals ||\n|-\n| 2017 || 1st || '''8''' || 30 || 12 || 8 || 10 || 30-34 || '''44''' || Quarter-finals ||\n|-\n| 2018 || 1st || '''8''' || 30 || 11 || 3 || 16 || 26-36 || '''36''' || Quarter-finals ||\n|-\n| 2019 || 1st || '''11''' || 30 || 9 || 7 || 14 || 29-46 || '''34''' || Quarter-finals ||\n|-\n| 2020 || 1st || '''5''' || 4 || 2 || 1 || 1 || 7-5 || '''7''' || Round of 16 ||\n|}\n\n==Honours==\n*Champions -

She was his sixth wife, as all his previous wives had died childless and in quick succession. They were a Karuneegar family in Marudhur, a village in the old  [[South Arcot|South Arcot district]], near [[Chidambaram]].  R\u0101malingam was their fifth child. The older ones were two sons Sabhapati and Parasu R\u0101man; and two daughters, Sundarammal and Unnamulai. They named their youngest child R\u0101malingam.\n\n===Childhood and divine experiences===\nOnce, R\u0101malingam's parents went to the [[Chidambaram Temple|Chidambaram Natar\u0101jar Temple]] with their five month old child, and the infant was joyous while the [[priest]]  was offering  [[Archana (Hinduism)|Deepa aradhana]] (adoration by lighted lamp being brought close to the vigrahams); this was perceived by R\u0101malingam as a deep spiritual experience. In later years he said of the experience:\n\n:\"No sooner the Light was perceived, happiness prevailed on me\", and\n\n:\"The sweet nectar was tasted by me as soon as the Arut perun jothi (Supreme Grace Of Light) became visible\".<ref>[http://www.textbooksonline.tn.nic.in/Books/08/SocSci-EM/History/chapter_6.pdf Arutperunjothi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916051722/http://www.textbooksonline.tn.nic.in/Books/08/SocSci-EM/History/chapter_6.pdf |date=2008-09-16 }}, Tamil Nadu Text books online</ref>\n\nIn 1824, his father R\u0101mayy\u0101 pillai died. Because of his untimely demise, Chinnammai shifted her residence to her mother's place at Chinna k\u0101vanam, Ponneri. Saint R\u0101malingam was a small child when he relocated with his mother to Chennai in 1826. He and his mother lived  with his eldest brother Sabhapati and his wife P\u0101pp\u0101thi at 31/14 Veerasamy Pillai Street at [[Sevenwells]] area of [[Chennai]], which is in the area near [[Kandaswami Temple, Georgetown|Chennai Kandha kottam Kandha sw\u0101mi temple.]] After R\u0101malingam reached five years of age, Sabhapati initiated his [[formal education]]. But the young child was not interested in that, instead he preferred trips to the nearby Kandha sw\u0101mi temple. Sabhapati thought that the child needed punishment as a form of discipline, and  he told his wife not to  give R\u0101malingam his daily meal. His kind sister-in-law, however, secretly gave him food and persuaded him to study seriously at home. God gave food before sister in law gave food. In return, R\u0101malingam asked  for his own room, lighted lamp and mirror.  He placed the light in front of the mirror. He started [[meditation]] by concentrating on the light and thus began the young boy's spiritual life. He miraculously saw a vision of the [[Murugan|Lord Muruga]]. R\u0101malingam said:\n\n:\"The beauty endowed divine faces six, the illustrious shoulders twelve.\"<ref>Lakshmi Devnath, [http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm \"Compassion is the essence of Saint R\u0101malingam's philosophy\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107124551/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |date=2011-01-07 }}, ''The Hindu'', February 2, 2001</ref>\n\nAt one time, R\u0101malingam had to replace his elder brother Sabhapati at an [[Katha (storytelling format)|upany\u0101sam]] (religious stories) session as up\u0101sakar. His great discourse on verses from the `[[Periya Puranam|Periya pur\u0101nam]]', an epic poem by [[Sekkizhar]] about the saintly '63 [[Nayanars|N\u0101yan\u0101rs]]', was appreciated by the devotees as being given by a very learned scholar. R\u0101malingam's mental and spiritual growth progressed rapidly.

But he was forced to marry his niece (on his sister's side). Legends say that the [[bridegroom]] during his first night after marriage was reading devotional works like the [[Tiruvasakam|Thiru v\u0101sagam]]. He was not interested in money, and it is said that in later life he reduced or ignored eating and sleeping. But he seemed fit in body, which was possibly due to his supposed physical transformation.\n\n==Teachings==\n[[File:Sathya gnana sabha, vadalur 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Heaps of grain bags at [[Satyagnana Sabha, Vadalur|Sathya gnana sabha, Vadalur]] - established by R\u0101malinga adigal ]]\nAt the age of 35 he left Chennai during the year 1858. First he went to [[Chidambaram]] where he had a debate with Kodakanallur Sundara Sw\u0101migal. At the request of one R\u0101makrishna Reddiyar he went to his house at [[Karunguzhi]] and stayed there for 9 years. He was very much against the [[caste|caste system]] because of the adverse impacts it had on society. Towards that end, he started the \"Samarasa  Vedha Sanmarga Sangam\" in 1865. In 1872 it was renamed \"Samarasa Suddha Sanmarga Sathya Sangam\",<ref name=\"ambalamyoga.org\" /> meaning \"Society for pure truth in universal self-hood\".\n\nIn 1867, he established a  facility serving free food named \"The Sathya Dharma Salai\"<ref>[http://www.Vallalarspace.com/VallalarGroups/ Image of Sathya Dharma Salai]</ref> in [[Vadalur]]. There all people are served free food without any caste distinctions. The land for the facility was donated by kind, generous people and those registered documents are available for seeing by the visitors. The free facility continues its service till the present time. R\u0101malinga disliked people eating [[non-vegetarian]] foods, about which he said:<blockquote>When I see men feeding on the coarse and vicious food of meat, it is an ever-recurring grief to me.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |title=\"The Hindu\" article on Vallal\u0101r |access-date=2008-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107124551/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |archive-date=2011-01-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref></blockquote>\n \n[[File:Sathya gnana sabha, vadalur 3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Entrance to the Sathya Gnana Sabha.

One of the primary teachings of Valallar is \"[[community service|Service]] to [[Human beings|Living Beings]] is the path of [[Moksha|Liberation/ Moksha]]\". He declared that death is not natural that our life's first priority should be to fight death. He declared religion in itself a darkness. He laid a very great emphasis on being vegetarian. He said God is \"Arul Perum Jothi\" who is personification of Grace or mercy and knowledge. He said the path of compassion and mercy are the only path to God.\n\nIn 1867 he established a center for feeding the poor people. On the inaugural day he lit the fire of the stone stove, with a declaration that the fire be ever alive and the needy shall be fed forever. Around 1872 he established the \"Sathya Gnana Sabai\", hall of True Wisdom Forum and ensuring it was entirely secular. This place is not a [[temple]]; fruits, flowers are not offered, and no blessings were given. It was open to people of all castes except those who ate meat, who were only allowed to worship from the outside. He wrote in detail about the ''pooja'' to be performed in Gn\u0101na sabai. Those who are below 12 years or those who are above 72 years alone were expected to enter Gn\u0101na sabai and do ''poojas''. The oil lamp lit by him is kept perpetually burning. He said that [[soul]]s are blinded by seven veils.<ref>[https://www.vallalyaar.com/enquiry-on-truth-satvisaaram-vallalar/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409135431/http://www.ambalamyoga.org/On%20Vallalar%20by%20Arul%20file.pdf |date=2011-04-09 }}</ref>\n \nThere are seven cotton fabric screens, representing the seven factors that prevent a soul from realizing its truth.

He said the intelligence we possess is [[Maya (religion)|Maya]] intelligence which is not true and final intelligence. The path of final intelligence is ''Jeeva Karunyam''. Looking other souls with compassion, also own soul from birth and death. He advocated a [[Caste in India|casteless society]]. Vallal\u0101r was opposed to [[superstition]]s and rituals. He forbade killing animals for the sake of food. He advocated feeding the poor as the highest form of worship. He condemned inequality based on birth.

He attained a total of 3 transformations (i.e. transformations into Pure Body, Pranava (Sound) Body, and Gnostic Body). His first transformation was the transformation of his normal human body into the Perfect Body. The supposed attributes of this body are total invulnerability to everything thus rendering him effectively immortal and impervious to any kind of damage as well as having the attributes of being omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient, this body is apparently made of Divine Light.\n\nBeyond this state there was a subsequent transformation by which the Perfect Body transformed further into the Grace Body possessing the following attributes: This body has automatically a young appearance like that of a child, can be seen but can't be touched, and has complete and absolute dominion over all the [[Siddhis]].\n\nEven beyond the State of the Grace Body supposedly there was a third and final transformation in which the Grace Body was transformed into the Bliss Body. This body is the body of the Supreme Godhead and is automatically omnipresent but can't be perceived by anyone.\n\nBy achieving this R\u0101malingam demonstrated that the ultimate states of spirituality can in fact be attained in this world with the physical body and death is not a necessity to experience the ultimate spiritual experience.\n\n==Merge with Divine as One==\nOn October 22, 1873, R\u0101malingam raised the ''flag of Brotherhood''{{what|date=October 2018}} on his one-room residence ''Siddhi Val\u0101gam'' in Mettukuppam.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |title=Article in \"The Hindu\" narration on Siddhi Valakam |access-date=2008-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107124551/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |archive-date=2011-01-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He gave his final and most popular lecture, about spiritual progress and, \"nature of the powers that lie beyond us and move us,\" and recommended meditation using the lighted lamp from his room, which he then kept outside.\n\nOn January 30, 1874, R\u0101malingam entered the room, locked himself inside and told his followers not to open it. After opening, he said, he will not be found there. (He will be \"United with Nature & ruling the actions of 'all of the alls',\" as told in his poem called 'Gnana Sariyai'). His seclusion spurred many rumors, and the Government finally forced the doors open in May. The room was empty, with no clues. In 1906, records about his disappearance<ref>[http://bp3.blogger.com/_ye_-S-DaxNE/R_RyHb_UkJI/AAAAAAAAAqs/98zB2rqpjDI/s1600-h/gazette+1.jpg The image of engraved stone in Vadalur] about the Madras District Gazette's note describing the R\u0101malingam's disappearance incident, that took place on January 30, 1874</ref> were published in the South Arcot District's 'The Madras District [[Gazette]]er'.\n\nThiruarutpa explains that he transmigrated the physical body to divine light body by thavam/penance.

She was his sixth wife, as all his previous wives had died childless and in quick succession. They were a Karuneegar family in Marudhur, a village in the old  [[South Arcot|South Arcot district]], near [[Chidambaram]].  R\u0101malingam was their fifth child. The older ones were two sons Sabhapati and Parasu R\u0101man; and two daughters, Sundarammal and Unnamulai. They named their youngest child R\u0101malingam.\n\n===Childhood and divine experiences===\nOnce, R\u0101malingam's parents went to the [[Chidambaram Temple|Chidambaram Natar\u0101jar Temple]] with their five month old child, and the infant was joyous while the [[priest]]  was offering  [[Archana (Hinduism)|Deepa aradhana]] (adoration by lighted lamp being brought close to the vigrahams); this was perceived by R\u0101malingam as a deep spiritual experience. In later years he said of the experience:\n\n:\"No sooner the Light was perceived, happiness prevailed on me\", and\n\n:\"The sweet nectar was tasted by me as soon as the Arut perun jothi (Supreme Grace Of Light) became visible\".<ref>[http://www.textbooksonline.tn.nic.in/Books/08/SocSci-EM/History/chapter_6.pdf Arutperunjothi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916051722/http://www.textbooksonline.tn.nic.in/Books/08/SocSci-EM/History/chapter_6.pdf |date=2008-09-16 }}, Tamil Nadu Text books online</ref>\n\nIn 1824, his father R\u0101mayy\u0101 pillai died. Because of his untimely demise, Chinnammai shifted her residence to her mother's place at Chinna k\u0101vanam, Ponneri. Saint R\u0101malingam was a small child when he relocated with his mother to Chennai in 1826. He and his mother lived  with his eldest brother Sabhapati and his wife P\u0101pp\u0101thi at 31/14 Veerasamy Pillai Street at [[Sevenwells]] area of [[Chennai]], which is in the area near [[Kandaswami Temple, Georgetown|Chennai Kandha kottam Kandha sw\u0101mi temple.]] After R\u0101malingam reached five years of age, Sabhapati initiated his [[formal education]]. But the young child was not interested in that, instead he preferred trips to the nearby Kandha sw\u0101mi temple. Sabhapati thought that the child needed punishment as a form of discipline, and  he told his wife not to  give R\u0101malingam his daily meal. His kind sister-in-law, however, secretly gave him food and persuaded him to study seriously at home. God gave food before sister in law gave food. In return, R\u0101malingam asked  for his own room, lighted lamp and mirror.  He placed the light in front of the mirror. He started [[meditation]] by concentrating on the light and thus began the young boy's spiritual life. He miraculously saw a vision of the [[Murugan|Lord Muruga]]. R\u0101malingam said:\n\n:\"The beauty endowed divine faces six, the illustrious shoulders twelve.\"<ref>Lakshmi Devnath, [http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm \"Compassion is the essence of Saint R\u0101malingam's philosophy\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107124551/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |date=2011-01-07 }}, ''The Hindu'', February 2, 2001</ref>\n\nAt one time, R\u0101malingam had to replace his elder brother Sabhapati at an [[Katha (storytelling format)|upany\u0101sam]] (religious stories) session as up\u0101sakar. His great discourse on verses from the `[[Periya Puranam|Periya pur\u0101nam]]', an epic poem by [[Sekkizhar]] about the saintly '63 [[Nayanars|N\u0101yan\u0101rs]]', was appreciated by the devotees as being given by a very learned scholar. R\u0101malingam's mental and spiritual growth progressed rapidly. R\u0101malingam says thanks to the [[divinity|Divine]] by:\n\n:\"Effulgent flame of grace, that lit in me intelligence, to know untaught.\"<ref>[http://www.Vallalar.org/WebComponents/FrontPage.aspx?ViewName=enBlogs&WebSiteId=1&ConId=294 Early life of Saint Vallal\u0101r]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nR\u0101malingam evolved in his spiritual journey from being a devout devotee of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] to worshipping the formless.\n\nR\u0101malingam renounced the world at the young age of thirteen. But he was forced to marry his niece (on his sister's side). Legends say that the [[bridegroom]] during his first night after marriage was reading devotional works like the [[Tiruvasakam|Thiru v\u0101sagam]]. He was not interested in money, and it is said that in later life he reduced or ignored eating and sleeping. But he seemed fit in body, which was possibly due to his supposed physical transformation.\n\n==Teachings==\n[[File:Sathya gnana sabha, vadalur 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Heaps of grain bags at [[Satyagnana Sabha, Vadalur|Sathya gnana sabha, Vadalur]] - established by R\u0101malinga adigal ]]\nAt the age of 35 he left Chennai during the year 1858.

The sign above it reads \"only those who have renounced meat and murder should enter\"]]\nOn January 25th of 1872, R\u0101malingam opened the \"[[Satyagnana Sabha, Vadalur|Sathya Gnana Sabha]]\" (Hall of True Knowledge) at [[Vadalur]]. One of the primary teachings of Valallar is \"[[community service|Service]] to [[Human beings|Living Beings]] is the path of [[Moksha|Liberation/ Moksha]]\". He declared that death is not natural that our life's first priority should be to fight death. He declared religion in itself a darkness. He laid a very great emphasis on being vegetarian. He said God is \"Arul Perum Jothi\" who is personification of Grace or mercy and knowledge. He said the path of compassion and mercy are the only path to God.\n\nIn 1867 he established a center for feeding the poor people. On the inaugural day he lit the fire of the stone stove, with a declaration that the fire be ever alive and the needy shall be fed forever. Around 1872 he established the \"Sathya Gnana Sabai\", hall of True Wisdom Forum and ensuring it was entirely secular. This place is not a [[temple]]; fruits, flowers are not offered, and no blessings were given. It was open to people of all castes except those who ate meat, who were only allowed to worship from the outside. He wrote in detail about the ''pooja'' to be performed in Gn\u0101na sabai. Those who are below 12 years or those who are above 72 years alone were expected to enter Gn\u0101na sabai and do ''poojas''. The oil lamp lit by him is kept perpetually burning. He said that [[soul]]s are blinded by seven veils.<ref>[https://www.vallalyaar.com/enquiry-on-truth-satvisaaram-vallalar/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409135431/http://www.ambalamyoga.org/On%20Vallalar%20by%20Arul%20file.pdf |date=2011-04-09 }}</ref>\n \nThere are seven cotton fabric screens, representing the seven factors that prevent a soul from realizing its truth.

He said the intelligence we possess is [[Maya (religion)|Maya]] intelligence which is not true and final intelligence. The path of final intelligence is ''Jeeva Karunyam''. Looking other souls with compassion, also own soul from birth and death. He advocated a [[Caste in India|casteless society]]. Vallal\u0101r was opposed to [[superstition]]s and rituals. He forbade killing animals for the sake of food. He advocated feeding the poor as the highest form of worship. He condemned inequality based on birth.

He attained a total of 3 transformations (i.e. transformations into Pure Body, Pranava (Sound) Body, and Gnostic Body). His first transformation was the transformation of his normal human body into the Perfect Body. The supposed attributes of this body are total invulnerability to everything thus rendering him effectively immortal and impervious to any kind of damage as well as having the attributes of being omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient, this body is apparently made of Divine Light.\n\nBeyond this state there was a subsequent transformation by which the Perfect Body transformed further into the Grace Body possessing the following attributes: This body has automatically a young appearance like that of a child, can be seen but can't be touched, and has complete and absolute dominion over all the [[Siddhis]].\n\nEven beyond the State of the Grace Body supposedly there was a third and final transformation in which the Grace Body was transformed into the Bliss Body. This body is the body of the Supreme Godhead and is automatically omnipresent but can't be perceived by anyone.\n\nBy achieving this R\u0101malingam demonstrated that the ultimate states of spirituality can in fact be attained in this world with the physical body and death is not a necessity to experience the ultimate spiritual experience.\n\n==Merge with Divine as One==\nOn October 22, 1873, R\u0101malingam raised the ''flag of Brotherhood''{{what|date=October 2018}} on his one-room residence ''Siddhi Val\u0101gam'' in Mettukuppam.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |title=Article in \"The Hindu\" narration on Siddhi Valakam |access-date=2008-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107124551/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |archive-date=2011-01-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He gave his final and most popular lecture, about spiritual progress and, \"nature of the powers that lie beyond us and move us,\" and recommended meditation using the lighted lamp from his room, which he then kept outside.\n\nOn January 30, 1874, R\u0101malingam entered the room, locked himself inside and told his followers not to open it. After opening, he said, he will not be found there. (He will be \"United with Nature & ruling the actions of 'all of the alls',\" as told in his poem called 'Gnana Sariyai'). His seclusion spurred many rumors, and the Government finally forced the doors open in May. The room was empty, with no clues. In 1906, records about his disappearance<ref>[http://bp3.blogger.com/_ye_-S-DaxNE/R_RyHb_UkJI/AAAAAAAAAqs/98zB2rqpjDI/s1600-h/gazette+1.jpg The image of engraved stone in Vadalur] about the Madras District Gazette's note describing the R\u0101malingam's disappearance incident, that took place on January 30, 1874</ref> were published in the South Arcot District's 'The Madras District [[Gazette]]er'.\n\nThiruarutpa explains that he transmigrated the physical body to divine light body by thavam/penance.
