In the 5th century, Tolosa fell to the [[Visigothic kingdom]] and became one of its major cities, in the early 6th century even serving as its capital, before it fell to the [[Francia|Franks]] under [[Clovis I|Clovis]] in 507 ([[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]]).\nFrom this time, Toulouse was the capital of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] within the Frankish realm. {{Cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 721, [[Odo the Great|Duke Odo]] of [[Aquitaine]] defeated an invading [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[Muslim]] army at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]]. Many Arab chroniclers consider that Odo's victory was the real stop to Muslim expansion into [[Christendom|Christian Europe]], incursions of the following years being simple raids without real will of conquest (including the one that ended with [[Charles Martel]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Tours]], also called the Battle of Poitiers)<ref>https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k415420b/f39.</ref>. \n\nThe Frankish conquest of [[Septimania]] followed in the 750s, and a quasi-independent [[County of Toulouse]] emerged within the Carolingian sub-kingdom of Aquitaine by the late 8th century. The [[Battle of Toulouse (844)|Battle of Toulouse of 844]], pitting [[Charles the Bald]] against [[Pepin II of Aquitaine]], was key in the Carolingian Civil War.\n\n===County of Toulouse===\n{{further|County of Toulouse}}\n[[File:Raymond IV of Toulouse.jpg|thumb|[[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]] was a leader of the [[First Crusade]]]]\nThe town became the capital of the [[County of Toulouse]] during the [[Carolingian era]].\n\nIn 1096, [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]], left with his army at the call of the Pope to join the [[First Crusade]], of which he was one of the main leaders.\n\nAt the beginning of the thirteenth century the county of Toulouse was taken in another crusade, of which it was the target this time. The reason for this was the development of [[Catharism]] in the south of France, which the Pope wanted to eradicate by all possible means. This struggle took on several aspects, going beyond the [[Albigensian Crusade|military crusade]], such as the creation of an original and militant Gothic architecture: the [[Southern French Gothic]]. \n\nIn 1215 the [[Dominican Order]] was founded in Toulouse by [[Saint Dominic]] in the context of struggle against the Cathar heresy.\n\nIn the [[Treaty of Paris (1229)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1229, Toulouse formally submitted to the crown of France. The county's sole heiress [[Joan, Countess of Toulouse|Joan]] was engaged to [[Alphonse, Count of Poitiers]], a younger brother of [[Louis IX of France]]. The marriage became legal in 1241, but it remained childless so that after Joan's death the county fell to the crown of France by inheritance.\nAlso in 1229, [[University of Toulouse]] was established after the [[University of Paris|Parisian model]], intended as a means to dissolve the heretic movement. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nVarious monastic orders, like the congregation of the order of ''fr\u00e8res pr\u00eacheurs'', were started.

The fear of repression forced the leading figures to exile, or to convert themselves. The inquisition lasted nearly 400 years, making Toulouse its capital. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n===Within the Kingdom of France===\n\nIn 1271, Toulouse was incorporated into the [[kingdom of France]] and declared a \"[[Crown lands of France#Reign of Philip III|royal city]]\". {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} In 1323 the [[Consistori del Gay Saber]] was created in Toulouse to preserve the [[Lyric poetry|lyric art]] of the [[troubadour]]s by organizing a poetry contest; and Toulouse became the centre of [[Occitania|Occitan]] literary culture for the next hundred years. The [[Consistori del Gay Saber]] is considered to be the oldest literary society in Europe, at the origin of the most sophisticated [[Leys d'amor|treatise]] on grammar and rhetoric of the Middle Ages, and in 1694 it was transformed into the Royal Academy of the [[Floral Games]] (''Acad\u00e9mie des Jeux Floraux''), still active today, by king Louis XIV.\n\nThe 14th century brought a [[pogrom]] against Toulouse's Jewish population by [[crusades|Crusaders]] in 1320,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/03/is-it-time-for-the-jews-to-leave-europe/386279/.\" | title=Goldberg, Jeffrey. \"Is it Time for the Jews to Leave Europe?\" The Atlantic.

(Pierre Baudis was mayor from 1971 to 1983.) \n\nBaudis tried to strengthen the international role of Toulouse (such as its [[Airbus]] operations), as well as revive the cultural heritage of the city. The Occitan cross, flag of [[Languedoc]] and symbol of the counts of Toulouse, was chosen as the new flag of the city, instead of the traditional coat of arms of Toulouse (which included the [[fleur de lis]] of the French monarchy). Many cultural institutions were created, in order to attract foreign expatriates and emphasise the city's past. For example, monuments dating from the time of the [[History of Toulouse|counts of Toulouse]] were restored, the city's symphonic concert hall (''Halle aux Grains'') was refurbished, a city theater was built, a Museum of Modern Art was founded, the [[Bemberg Foundation]] (European paintings and [[Bronze sculpture|bronzes]] from the [[Renaissance]] to the 20th century) was established, a huge pop music concert venue (''Z\u00e9nith'', the largest in France outside Paris) was built, the space museum and educational park ''[[Cit\u00e9 de l'Espace]]'' was founded, etc.\n\nTo deal with growth, major housing and transportation projects were launched.

Douste-Blazy had to deal with a reinvigorated political opposition, as well as with the dramatic explosion of the [[AZF (factory)|AZF]] plant in late 2001.\n\nIn March 2004, he entered the national government, and left Toulouse in the hands of his second-in-command [[Jean-Luc Moudenc]], elected mayor by the municipal council. In March 2008, Moudenc was defeated by the Socialist Party's candidate [[Pierre Cohen]].\n\nAt the next elections in 2014 Moudenc defeated Cohen in a rematch to re-take the job with more than 52% of the votes.\n\n===Mayors===\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In the 5th century, Tolosa fell to the [[Visigothic kingdom]] and became one of its major cities, in the early 6th century even serving as its capital, before it fell to the [[Francia|Franks]] under [[Clovis I|Clovis]] in 507 ([[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]]).\nFrom this time, Toulouse was the capital of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] within the Frankish realm. {{Cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 721, [[Odo the Great|Duke Odo]] of [[Aquitaine]] defeated an invading [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[Muslim]] army at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]]. Many Arab chroniclers consider that Odo's victory was the real stop to Muslim expansion into [[Christendom|Christian Europe]], incursions of the following years being simple raids without real will of conquest (including the one that ended with [[Charles Martel]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Tours]], also called the Battle of Poitiers)<ref>https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k415420b/f39.</ref>. \n\nThe Frankish conquest of [[Septimania]] followed in the 750s, and a quasi-independent [[County of Toulouse]] emerged within the Carolingian sub-kingdom of Aquitaine by the late 8th century. The [[Battle of Toulouse (844)|Battle of Toulouse of 844]], pitting [[Charles the Bald]] against [[Pepin II of Aquitaine]], was key in the Carolingian Civil War.\n\n===County of Toulouse===\n{{further|County of Toulouse}}\n[[File:Raymond IV of Toulouse.jpg|thumb|[[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]] was a leader of the [[First Crusade]]]]\nThe town became the capital of the [[County of Toulouse]] during the [[Carolingian era]].\n\nIn 1096, [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]], left with his army at the call of the Pope to join the [[First Crusade]], of which he was one of the main leaders.\n\nAt the beginning of the thirteenth century the county of Toulouse was taken in another crusade, of which it was the target this time. The reason for this was the development of [[Catharism]] in the south of France, which the Pope wanted to eradicate by all possible means. This struggle took on several aspects, going beyond the [[Albigensian Crusade|military crusade]], such as the creation of an original and militant Gothic architecture: the [[Southern French Gothic]]. \n\nIn 1215 the [[Dominican Order]] was founded in Toulouse by [[Saint Dominic]] in the context of struggle against the Cathar heresy.\n\nIn the [[Treaty of Paris (1229)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1229, Toulouse formally submitted to the crown of France. The county's sole heiress [[Joan, Countess of Toulouse|Joan]] was engaged to [[Alphonse, Count of Poitiers]], a younger brother of [[Louis IX of France]]. The marriage became legal in 1241, but it remained childless so that after Joan's death the county fell to the crown of France by inheritance.\nAlso in 1229, [[University of Toulouse]] was established after the [[University of Paris|Parisian model]], intended as a means to dissolve the heretic movement. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nVarious monastic orders, like the congregation of the order of ''fr\u00e8res pr\u00eacheurs'', were started.

(Pierre Baudis was mayor from 1971 to 1983.) \n\nBaudis tried to strengthen the international role of Toulouse (such as its [[Airbus]] operations), as well as revive the cultural heritage of the city. The Occitan cross, flag of [[Languedoc]] and symbol of the counts of Toulouse, was chosen as the new flag of the city, instead of the traditional coat of arms of Toulouse (which included the [[fleur de lis]] of the French monarchy). Many cultural institutions were created, in order to attract foreign expatriates and emphasise the city's past. For example, monuments dating from the time of the [[History of Toulouse|counts of Toulouse]] were restored, the city's symphonic concert hall (''Halle aux Grains'') was refurbished, a city theater was built, a Museum of Modern Art was founded, the [[Bemberg Foundation]] (European paintings and [[Bronze sculpture|bronzes]] from the [[Renaissance]] to the 20th century) was established, a huge pop music concert venue (''Z\u00e9nith'', the largest in France outside Paris) was built, the space museum and educational park ''[[Cit\u00e9 de l'Espace]]'' was founded, etc.\n\nTo deal with growth, major housing and transportation projects were launched. Line A of the [[Rapid transit|underground]] was opened in 1993, and line B opened in 2007. The creation of a system of underground car parking structures in Toulouse city centre was sharply criticised by the [[The Greens (France)|Green Party]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bonjourlafrance.com/france-city/toulouse-france/toulouse-politics.htm |title=Toulouse politics information |publisher=Bonjourlafrance.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Dominique Baudis was at the zenith of his popularity, with approval rates of 85%. {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} He announced that he would not run for a fourth (6-year) term in 2001. He explained that with 3 terms he was already the longest-serving mayor of Toulouse since the [[French Revolution]]; he felt that change would be good for the city, and that the number of terms should be limited. He endorsed [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]], then [[Union for French Democracy|UDF]] mayor of [[Lourdes]] as his successor. Baudis has since been appointed president of the CSA (''[[Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de l'audiovisuel]]'') in Paris, the French equivalent of the American [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]].\n\nPhilippe Douste-Blazy narrowly won in the 2001 elections, which saw the left making its best showing in decades. Douste-Blazy had to deal with a reinvigorated political opposition, as well as with the dramatic explosion of the [[AZF (factory)|AZF]] plant in late 2001.\n\nIn March 2004, he entered the national government, and left Toulouse in the hands of his second-in-command [[Jean-Luc Moudenc]], elected mayor by the municipal council. In March 2008, Moudenc was defeated by the Socialist Party's candidate [[Pierre Cohen]].\n\nAt the next elections in 2014 Moudenc defeated Cohen in a rematch to re-take the job with more than 52% of the votes.\n\n===Mayors===\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Papia means speak.

The community of speakers descends mainly from [[interracial relationship]]s between Portuguese men and local women, as well as a number of migrants from [[Portuguese India]], themselves of mixed [[Luso-Indian|Indo-Portuguese]] ancestry.\n\nKristang had a substantial influence on [[Macanese language|Macanese]], the creole language spoken in [[Macau]], due to substantial migration from Malacca after its takeover by the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]].\n\nEven after Portugal lost Malacca and almost all contact in 1641, the Kristang community largely preserved its language. The language is not taught at school, although there are still some Church services in Kristang.\n\nHowever, Papia Kristang is facing a decrease in language use within the community.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Baxter |first1= Alan.N |date= 1996|title= Portuguese and Creole Portuguese in the Pacific and Western Pacific rim|doi= 10.1515/9783110819724.2.299 |access-date=}}</ref> There is a language shift to [[English_language|English]] and [[Malay_language|Bahasa Malaysia]] due to prestige and accessibility that eventually led to a decline in Kristang language use.\n\n== Distribution ==\n\nThe language has about 750 speakers in Malacca<ref>{{harvp|Baxter|2005|page=16}}</ref> and another 100 in Singapore.<ref name=\"Wong 2016\">{{cite web|last1=Wong|first1=Kevin Martens|title=Kodrah Kristang Kaminyu di Kodramintu: Kinyang Ngua (The Kristang Language Revitalization Plan, Phase One)|url=https://kodrahkristang.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/kaminyu-di-kodramintu-v1.pdf|website=Kodrah Kristang|accessdate=August 12, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013200854/https://kodrahkristang.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/kaminyu-di-kodramintu-v1.pdf|archivedate=October 13, 2016}}</ref> A small number of speakers also live in other Portuguese Eurasian communities in [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Penang]] in Malaysia, and in diaspora communities in [[Perth]], [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]] and elsewhere.<ref name=\"Baxter1988\">{{Cite book |url=http://sealang.net/archives/pl/pdf/PL-B95.pdf |title=A Grammar of Kristang (Malacca Creole Portuguese) |last=Baxter |first=Alan N. |publisher=Pacific Linguistics |year=1988 |isbn=0-85883-375-1  |series=Pacific Linguistics Series B - No. 95 |location=Canberra |doi=10.15144/pl-b95 |hdl=1885/145643 |hdl-access=free |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n===Revitalisation efforts===\nThe language is currently in steep decline, although efforts to revive it have begun in recent years in both the Portuguese Settlement in Malacca and Singapore.\n\n====Singapore====\nThe revitalisation of Papia Kristang in Singapore can be largely attributed to the [https://kodrah.kristang.com Kodrah Kristang]('Awaken, Kristang') initiative led by Kevin Martens Wong<ref name=\"Wong 2016\"/>. This long-term revitalisation initiative seeks to revitalize the language by teaching it to a new generation of learners through complementary classes and the provision of online materials.\n\nIn 2017, they held the first Kristang Language Festival which was attended by more than 1,400 people, including the Portuguese-Eurasian community in Singapore and Singapore\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister [[Teo Chee Hean]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://kodrah.kristang.com/1st-kristang-language-festival/|title= 1st Kristang Language Festival|accessdate=March 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\nA Kristang Online Dictionary was also launched at the first Kristang Language Festival. The project, ''Pinchah Kristang: A Dictionary of Kristang''<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.luismc.com/pinchah_kristang/|title= Pinchah Kristang: A Dictionary of Kristang|accessdate=April 15, 2020}}</ref>, is led and developed by Lu\u00eds Morgado da Costa based on the WordNet system developed at the [[Nanyang_Technological_University|Nanyang Technological University]].\n\nThis dictionary also supports another initiative known as ''Jardinggu, or Kristang Lexical Incubator''<ref>{{cite web|url= https://kodrahkristang.wordpress.com/jardinggu/|title= Jardinggu: The Kristang Lexical Incubator|accessdate=April 15, 2020}}</ref>. Initiated in April 2017, the Jardinggu provides a space for the discussion and accelerated addition of new words into the Kristang lexicon. Through this initiative, around 320 new lexemes for concepts that were previously represented by English loans have been suggested by the Kodrah community.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/blog.nus.edu.sg/dist/0/11221/files/2019/12/Wong-special-session.pdf|title=New word development in Singapore Kristang and its implications for variation |publisher= |access-date=15 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Malacca====\nThe Kristang-speaking community located at the Portuguese Settlement, or Padri sa Chang (\u201cThe Priest\u2019s Land\u201d) was able to undertake more sustained revitalisation efforts and publicise itself to non-Eurasian Malaysians, and the language. Notably with texts, stories and phrasebooks in Kristang produced by [[Joan Margaret Marbeck]] and through investments and interest from individuals and organisations outside the community. Joan Marbeck has produced three publications: ''Ungu Adanza'' (An Inheritance), ''Linggu Mai'' (Mother Tongue) and the Kristang Phrasebook. She is also credited with writing probably the only play in Kristang, called ''Seng Marianne'' (Without Marianne) and was also instrumental in staging a musical in Kristang - ''Kazamintu no Praiya'' which translates to 'Wedding on the beach'.<ref>{{cite paper|author = HAJA MOHIDEEN BIN MOHAMED ALI|title = THE MAINTENANCE OF MALAYSIA\u2019S MINORITY LANGUAGES| publisher = | date = 2010|url = http://irep.iium.edu.my/9829/4/ICMM2010_p27.pdf|format = PDF|pages = |accessdate=April 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\nWithin the community, there were efforts made together with the help of academics to promote their culture and the Kristang language.

While Portuguese verbs mainly use morphology, or suffixes, to change a verb\u2019s tense or for it to match with the person and number of its subject, Malay does not change the form of the verb itself. Instead, it makes use of pre-verbal words to convey tense and does not indicate the person or number of the subject in the form of the verb. Kristang\u2019s structure is practically identical to Malay, although the choice of words comes from Portuguese. \n\nTo indicate verb tenses, the following appositions are used: ''jah'' (i.e. from the Portuguese ''j\u00e1'', meaning \"already\", or controversially a corruption of Malay ''dah'', shortened version of ''sudah'', also \"already\") for past tenses; ''ta'' (from ''est\u00e1'', which means \"is\") for present continuous tenses and ''logu'' or ''lo'' (from ''logo'', which means \"soon\") for the future tense. These simplified forms correspond with their equivalents in Malay ''sudah'', ''sedang'', and ''akan'', respectively.\n\n{|class=wikitable\n!English\n!Portuguese\n!Malay\n!Kristang\n|-\n|I eat \n|Eu como\n|Saya makan\n|Yo kumih\n|-\n|I ate/have eaten \n|Eu comi\n|Saya sudah makan\n|Yo ja kumih\n|-\n|I will eat \n|Eu comerei\n|Saya akan makan\n|Yo logu kumih\n|-\n|He eats\n|Ele come\n|Dia makan\n|Eli kumih\n|-\n<sup></sup> \n|}\n\nPluralisation is also the same in Malay as in Kristang. For example in English and Portuguese, an \u2018\u2013s\u2019 is added to make cats or gatos, whereas in Kristang and Malay, the entire word is duplicated , such as gatu-gatu in Kristang, and kucing-kucing in Malay.\n\nAdversity Passive, which is used to talk about situations where a negative action happens to something, but the person or originator of the negative action is not mentioned something, is also present both in Kristang and Malay. The Adversity Passive is signaled by kena (Malay), and by tokah (Kristang). \n\n{|class=wikitable\n!Colloquial Malay \n!Kristang\n!Colloquial English near-equivalent\n|-\n|Ikan kena makan\n|Pesi tokah kumih\n|The fish got eaten\n|-\n<sup></sup> \n|}\n\n= Vocabulary =\n\nA peculiarity of the language is the pronoun ''yo'' (meaning \"I\") which is used in [[northern Portuguese  dialects|Northern Portuguese]]  (pronounced as ''yeu'') as well as Spanish and Italian/Sicilian.\n\nThe Kristang lexicon borrowed heavily from Portuguese, but often with drastic truncation; for example, Portuguese ''padrinho'' and ''madrinha'' (\"godfather\" and \"godmother\") became ''inyu'' and ''inya'' in Kristang. As it is primarily a Creole language, much of its vocabulary is derived from Chinese, Indian and Malay languages to varying degrees.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mohideen, S & Mohideen, S|first=|date=2008|title=Survival of the Minority Kristang Language in Malaysia|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/85673255/|journal=Language in India|volume=8(7)|pages=1-18|via=}}</ref>\n!Meaning\n!Kristang Word\n!Origin Word\n!Origin Word Language\n|-\n|Shrimp Paste\n|blacan\n|belacan\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Malay\n|-\n|Walking Stick\n|tongkah\n|tongkat\n|-\n|Hoe\n|changkol\n|cangkul\n|-\n|Jellyfish\n|ampeh\n|ampai\n|-\n|Loincloth\n|kachu\n|katchu\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Tamil\n|-\n|Lime\n|churutu\n|surutu\n|-\n|Grandfather\n|tata\n|thatha\n|-\n|Spatula\n|chengsi\n|chiensi\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Hokkien\n|-\n|Lantern\n|aloleng\n|leng tsu\n|-\n|Open-air restaurant\n|kolau\n|kou lau\n|Cantonese\n|-\n|Convent\n|konventu\n|convent\n| rowspan=\"2\" |English\n|-\n|Hospital\n|ospital\n|hospital\n|-\n|Toilet\n|kakus\n|kakhuis\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Dutch\n|-\n|Tombstone\n|kelda\n|kelder\n|}\n[[Metathesis (linguistics)|Metathesis]] was common: for example, Portuguese ''gordo'' \"fat\" gave Kristang ''godru''.  The Portuguese diphthong ''oi'' (or archaic ''ou'') was reduced to ''o'', e.g. ''dois''/''dous'' \"two\" \u2192 ''dos'',  ''\u00e0 noite''/''\u00e0 noute'' \"tonight\" \u2192 ''anoti''/''anuti''.\n \nMany Portuguese words that began with ''ch'', pronounced {{IPA|[\u0283]}} (\"sh\") in modern Portuguese, have the pronunciation {{IPA|[t\u0283]}} (\"ch\" as in \"cheese\") in Kristang. So, for example, Portuguese ''chegar'' \"to arrive\" and ''chuva'' \"rain\" produced Kristang ''chegak'' and ''chua'' (pronounced with {{IPA|[t\u0283]}}). This could have been due to [[Malay language|Malay]] influence, or it could be that Kristang preserved the original pronunciation  {{IPA|[t\u0283]}} of Old Portuguese. (Note that Portuguese \"ch\" pronounced {{IPA|[t\u0283]}} occurs in Northern Portugal.)\n\nThe chief resource for individuals to pick up Kristang is a Kristang-English dictionary compiled by Baxter and de Silva<ref>{{Cite journal|last=N Baxter|first=Alan|date=2004|title=A dictionary of Kristang (Malacca Creole Portuguese) with an English-Kristang finderlist|url=https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/146269/1/PL-564|journal=Pacific Linguistics|volume=|pages=|via=Pacific Linguistics}}</ref>\n\n== Writing system ==\n\nKristang was and is largely an oral language and has never been taught officially in schools. The first proposal<ref name=\"Baxter1988\"/> for a standard orthography was made in the late 1980s, with the publication of a thesis, \u201cA Grammar of Kristang\u201d by Alan N. Baxter, in which he emphasizes the use of the [[Malay alphabet|Malay orthography]].\n\nAs in most [[Portuguese dialects]], the vowel ''e'' is usually pronounced {{IPA|[i]}} when followed by a syllable with {{IPA|/i/}}; so, for example, ''penitensia'' (\"penitence\") is pronounced {{IPA|[pini\u02c8te\u0272sia]}}.\n\nIn the 1990s, [[Joan Margaret Marbeck]]'s book ''Ungua Andanza'' was published, with the orthography written in a Luso-Malay context.<ref>Joan Margaret Marbeck.

It is spoken by the [[Kristang people|Kristang]], a community of people of mixed Portuguese and Asian ancestry of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] race, chiefly in [[Malacca]] ([[Malaysia]]).\n\nThe language is also called '''''Crist\u00e3o''''' or '''''Cristan''''' (\"Christian\"), '''''Portugues di Melaka''''' (\"Malacca Portuguese\"), '''''Linggu Mai''''' (\"Mother Tongue\") or simply '''''Papia'''''. Papia means speak. However, locals and most of the Kristang community refer to the language as \"[[Portugis language|Portugis]]\".\n\nIn ''[[Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger]]'' (2010; formerly the ''Red Book of Endangered Languages'') published by [[UNESCO]], Kristang is classified as a \u201cseverely endangered\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last= Moseley|first= Christopher|author-link= |date= 2012 |title= The UNESCO atlas of the world's languages in danger|url= |location= |publisher=World Oral Literature Project |page= |isbn=978-92-3-104096-2}}</ref> language, with only about 2,000 people who speak it.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Kristang language originated after the conquest of [[Sultanate of Malacca|Malacca]] (Malaysia) in 1511 by the [[Portuguese Empire]]. The community of speakers descends mainly from [[interracial relationship]]s between Portuguese men and local women, as well as a number of migrants from [[Portuguese India]], themselves of mixed [[Luso-Indian|Indo-Portuguese]] ancestry.\n\nKristang had a substantial influence on [[Macanese language|Macanese]], the creole language spoken in [[Macau]], due to substantial migration from Malacca after its takeover by the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]].\n\nEven after Portugal lost Malacca and almost all contact in 1641, the Kristang community largely preserved its language. The language is not taught at school, although there are still some Church services in Kristang.\n\nHowever, Papia Kristang is facing a decrease in language use within the community.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Baxter |first1= Alan.N |date= 1996|title= Portuguese and Creole Portuguese in the Pacific and Western Pacific rim|doi= 10.1515/9783110819724.2.299 |access-date=}}</ref> There is a language shift to [[English_language|English]] and [[Malay_language|Bahasa Malaysia]] due to prestige and accessibility that eventually led to a decline in Kristang language use.\n\n== Distribution ==\n\nThe language has about 750 speakers in Malacca<ref>{{harvp|Baxter|2005|page=16}}</ref> and another 100 in Singapore.<ref name=\"Wong 2016\">{{cite web|last1=Wong|first1=Kevin Martens|title=Kodrah Kristang Kaminyu di Kodramintu: Kinyang Ngua (The Kristang Language Revitalization Plan, Phase One)|url=https://kodrahkristang.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/kaminyu-di-kodramintu-v1.pdf|website=Kodrah Kristang|accessdate=August 12, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013200854/https://kodrahkristang.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/kaminyu-di-kodramintu-v1.pdf|archivedate=October 13, 2016}}</ref> A small number of speakers also live in other Portuguese Eurasian communities in [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Penang]] in Malaysia, and in diaspora communities in [[Perth]], [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]] and elsewhere.<ref name=\"Baxter1988\">{{Cite book |url=http://sealang.net/archives/pl/pdf/PL-B95.pdf |title=A Grammar of Kristang (Malacca Creole Portuguese) |last=Baxter |first=Alan N. |publisher=Pacific Linguistics |year=1988 |isbn=0-85883-375-1  |series=Pacific Linguistics Series B - No. 95 |location=Canberra |doi=10.15144/pl-b95 |hdl=1885/145643 |hdl-access=free |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n===Revitalisation efforts===\nThe language is currently in steep decline, although efforts to revive it have begun in recent years in both the Portuguese Settlement in Malacca and Singapore.\n\n====Singapore====\nThe revitalisation of Papia Kristang in Singapore can be largely attributed to the [https://kodrah.kristang.com Kodrah Kristang]('Awaken, Kristang') initiative led by Kevin Martens Wong<ref name=\"Wong 2016\"/>. This long-term revitalisation initiative seeks to revitalize the language by teaching it to a new generation of learners through complementary classes and the provision of online materials.\n\nIn 2017, they held the first Kristang Language Festival which was attended by more than 1,400 people, including the Portuguese-Eurasian community in Singapore and Singapore\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister [[Teo Chee Hean]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://kodrah.kristang.com/1st-kristang-language-festival/|title= 1st Kristang Language Festival|accessdate=March 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\nA Kristang Online Dictionary was also launched at the first Kristang Language Festival. The project, ''Pinchah Kristang: A Dictionary of Kristang''<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.luismc.com/pinchah_kristang/|title= Pinchah Kristang: A Dictionary of Kristang|accessdate=April 15, 2020}}</ref>, is led and developed by Lu\u00eds Morgado da Costa based on the WordNet system developed at the [[Nanyang_Technological_University|Nanyang Technological University]].\n\nThis dictionary also supports another initiative known as ''Jardinggu, or Kristang Lexical Incubator''<ref>{{cite web|url= https://kodrahkristang.wordpress.com/jardinggu/|title= Jardinggu: The Kristang Lexical Incubator|accessdate=April 15, 2020}}</ref>. Initiated in April 2017, the Jardinggu provides a space for the discussion and accelerated addition of new words into the Kristang lexicon. Through this initiative, around 320 new lexemes for concepts that were previously represented by English loans have been suggested by the Kodrah community.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/blog.nus.edu.sg/dist/0/11221/files/2019/12/Wong-special-session.pdf|title=New word development in Singapore Kristang and its implications for variation |publisher= |access-date=15 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Malacca====\nThe Kristang-speaking community located at the Portuguese Settlement, or Padri sa Chang (\u201cThe Priest\u2019s Land\u201d) was able to undertake more sustained revitalisation efforts and publicise itself to non-Eurasian Malaysians, and the language. Notably with texts, stories and phrasebooks in Kristang produced by [[Joan Margaret Marbeck]] and through investments and interest from individuals and organisations outside the community. Joan Marbeck has produced three publications: ''Ungu Adanza'' (An Inheritance), ''Linggu Mai'' (Mother Tongue) and the Kristang Phrasebook. She is also credited with writing probably the only play in Kristang, called ''Seng Marianne'' (Without Marianne) and was also instrumental in staging a musical in Kristang - ''Kazamintu no Praiya'' which translates to 'Wedding on the beach'.<ref>{{cite paper|author = HAJA MOHIDEEN BIN MOHAMED ALI|title = THE MAINTENANCE OF MALAYSIA\u2019S MINORITY LANGUAGES| publisher = | date = 2010|url = http://irep.iium.edu.my/9829/4/ICMM2010_p27.pdf|format = PDF|pages = |accessdate=April 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\nWithin the community, there were efforts made together with the help of academics to promote their culture and the Kristang language. In 1988, Alan Baxter published ''A grammar of Kristang'' based on his fieldwork within the community.<ref name=\"Baxter1988\"/>\n\nThere are also supports from the Lisbon-based Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, which funded and published Marbeck\u2019s Kristang texts<ref>Joan Margaret Marbeck. ''Ungua Adanza'' (Heritage).

While Portuguese verbs mainly use morphology, or suffixes, to change a verb\u2019s tense or for it to match with the person and number of its subject, Malay does not change the form of the verb itself. Instead, it makes use of pre-verbal words to convey tense and does not indicate the person or number of the subject in the form of the verb. Kristang\u2019s structure is practically identical to Malay, although the choice of words comes from Portuguese. \n\nTo indicate verb tenses, the following appositions are used: ''jah'' (i.e. from the Portuguese ''j\u00e1'', meaning \"already\", or controversially a corruption of Malay ''dah'', shortened version of ''sudah'', also \"already\") for past tenses; ''ta'' (from ''est\u00e1'', which means \"is\") for present continuous tenses and ''logu'' or ''lo'' (from ''logo'', which means \"soon\") for the future tense. These simplified forms correspond with their equivalents in Malay ''sudah'', ''sedang'', and ''akan'', respectively.\n\n{|class=wikitable\n!English\n!Portuguese\n!Malay\n!Kristang\n|-\n|I eat \n|Eu como\n|Saya makan\n|Yo kumih\n|-\n|I ate/have eaten \n|Eu comi\n|Saya sudah makan\n|Yo ja kumih\n|-\n|I will eat \n|Eu comerei\n|Saya akan makan\n|Yo logu kumih\n|-\n|He eats\n|Ele come\n|Dia makan\n|Eli kumih\n|-\n<sup></sup> \n|}\n\nPluralisation is also the same in Malay as in Kristang. For example in English and Portuguese, an \u2018\u2013s\u2019 is added to make cats or gatos, whereas in Kristang and Malay, the entire word is duplicated , such as gatu-gatu in Kristang, and kucing-kucing in Malay.\n\nAdversity Passive, which is used to talk about situations where a negative action happens to something, but the person or originator of the negative action is not mentioned something, is also present both in Kristang and Malay. The Adversity Passive is signaled by kena (Malay), and by tokah (Kristang). \n\n{|class=wikitable\n!Colloquial Malay \n!Kristang\n!Colloquial English near-equivalent\n|-\n|Ikan kena makan\n|Pesi tokah kumih\n|The fish got eaten\n|-\n<sup></sup> \n|}\n\n= Vocabulary =\n\nA peculiarity of the language is the pronoun ''yo'' (meaning \"I\") which is used in [[northern Portuguese  dialects|Northern Portuguese]]  (pronounced as ''yeu'') as well as Spanish and Italian/Sicilian.\n\nThe Kristang lexicon borrowed heavily from Portuguese, but often with drastic truncation; for example, Portuguese ''padrinho'' and ''madrinha'' (\"godfather\" and \"godmother\") became ''inyu'' and ''inya'' in Kristang.\n\n[[Metathesis (linguistics)|Metathesis]] was common: for example, Portuguese ''gordo'' \"fat\" gave Kristang ''godru''.  The Portuguese diphthong ''oi'' (or archaic ''ou'') was reduced to ''o'', e.g. ''dois''/''dous'' \"two\" \u2192 ''dos'',  ''\u00e0 noite''/''\u00e0 noute'' \"tonight\" \u2192 ''anoti''/''anuti''.\n \nMany Portuguese words that began with ''ch'', pronounced {{IPA|[\u0283]}} (\"sh\") in modern Portuguese, have the pronunciation {{IPA|[t\u0283]}} (\"ch\" as in \"cheese\") in Kristang. So, for example, Portuguese ''chegar'' \"to arrive\" and ''chuva'' \"rain\" produced Kristang ''chegak'' and ''chua'' (pronounced with {{IPA|[t\u0283]}}). This could have been due to [[Malay language|Malay]] influence, or it could be that Kristang preserved the original pronunciation  {{IPA|[t\u0283]}} of Old Portuguese. (Note that Portuguese \"ch\" pronounced {{IPA|[t\u0283]}} occurs in Northern Portugal.)\n\n== Writing system ==\n\nKristang was and is largely an oral language and has never been taught officially in schools. The first proposal<ref name=\"Baxter1988\"/> for a standard orthography was made in the late 1980s, with the publication of a thesis, \u201cA Grammar of Kristang\u201d by Alan N. Baxter, in which he emphasizes the use of the [[Malay alphabet|Malay orthography]].\n\nAs in most [[Portuguese dialects]], the vowel ''e'' is usually pronounced {{IPA|[i]}} when followed by a syllable with {{IPA|/i/}}; so, for example, ''penitensia'' (\"penitence\") is pronounced {{IPA|[pini\u02c8te\u0272sia]}}.\n\nIn the 1990s, [[Joan Margaret Marbeck]]'s book ''Ungua Andanza'' was published, with the orthography written in a Luso-Malay context.<ref>Joan Margaret Marbeck. ''Ungua Adanza'' (Heritage). Lisbon: Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, 1995</ref>\n\n== Examples ==\n\n===Numbers===\nMuch of the lexicon for Kristang numbers draws influence from Portuguese, a [[Romance language]]. However, unlike Portuguese, which distinguishes between the masculine and feminine forms of \u201cone\u201d (''um/uma'') and \u201ctwo\u201d (''dois/duas''), numbers in Kristang do not inflect for gender.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English\n!Kristang\n!Portuguese\n!Malay\n|-\n|one\n|ungua/ngua \n|um (''masc.'') / uma (''fem.'')\n|satu\n|-\n|two\n|dos\n|dois (''masc.'') / duas (''fem.'')\n|dua\n|-\n|three\n|tres\n|tr\u00eas\n|tiga\n|-\n|four\n|katru\n|quatro\n|empat\n|-\n|five\n|singku\n|cinco\n|lima\n|-\n|six\n|sez\n|seis\n|enam\n|-\n|seven\n|seti\n|sete\n|tujuh\n|-\n|eight\n|oitu\n|oito\n|lapan\n|-\n|nine\n|nubi\n|nove\n|sembilan\n|-\n|ten\n|des\n|dez\n|sepuluh\n|-\n|}\n\n===Pronouns===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English\n!Kristang\n!Portuguese\n!Malay\n|-\n|Me\n|yo\n|eu\n|saya (''formal'') / aku (''casual'')\n|-\n|You (singular)\n|bos\n|v\u00f3s\n|Awak/Kamu\n|-\n|You (plural)\n|bolotudu/bolotu\n|v\u00f3s todos\n|Awak semua/Kamu semua\n|-\n|We\n|nus\n|n\u00f3s\n|kami\n|-\n|He/she/it\n|eli\n|ele, ela, isto\n|dia\n|-\n|They\n|olotu\n|eles\n|mereka\n|-\n|}\n\n===Common phrases===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English\n!Kristang\n!Portuguese\n!Malay\n|-\n|Thank You\n|Mutu Merseh\n|Muitas merc\u00eas\n|Terima Kasih\n|-\n|How Are You?\n|Teng Bong?\n|Est\u00e1s bom?/T\u00eam bom?\n|Awak apa khabar?\n|-\n|What's your name?\n|Ki bos sa numi?\n|Qual \u00e9 o seu nome?/Qual \u00e9 o seu nome?\n|Siapa nama awak?\n|-\n|Good Morning\n|Bong Pamiang\n|Boa Manh\u00e3\n|Selamat Pagi\n|-\n|Good Afternoon\n|Bong Midia\n|Bom Meio-dia\n|Selamat Petang\n|-\n|Good Evening\n|Bong Atadi\n|Boa Tarde\n|Selamat Malam\n|-\n|Good Night\n|Bong Anuti\n|Boa Noite\n|Selamat Malam/Tidur\n|-\n|Mother\n|mai\n|m\u00e3e\n|Emak/Ibu/Bonda/Ummi/Mama\n|-\n|Father\n|pai\n|pai\n|Bapa/Ayah/Abah/Abi\n|-\n|Wife\n|muleh\n|mulher\n|Isteri\n|-\n|Husband\n|maridu\n|marido\n|Suami\n|-\n|Old Woman\n|bela\n|velha\n|Wanita Tua\n|-\n|Old Man\n|belu\n|velho\n|Lelaki Tua\n|-\n|Little one\n|Quenino/Keninu\n|Pequenino\n|Si Kecil\n|-\n|Mouth\n|boka\n|boca\n|Mulut\n|-\n|Fat\n|godru\n|gordo\n|Gemuk\n|-\n|Beautiful\n|bonitu\n|bonito\n|Cantik\n|-\n|Party\n|festa\n|festa\n|Pesta\n|-\n|Yes\n|seng\n|sim\n|Ya\n|-\n|No\n|ngka\n|n\u00e3o\n|Tidak\n|-\n|Who\n|keng\n|quem\n|Siapa\n|-\n|What\n|ki\n|que\n|Apa\n|-\n|When\n|kiora\n|quando (\"que hora\")\n|Bila\n|-\n|Where\n|ondi\n|onde\n|Mana\n|-\n|Why\n|kifoi \n|porque (\"que foi\")\n|Mengapa\n|-\n|How\n|klai\n|como\n|Bagaimana\n|-\n|}\n\n===Poem of Malacca===\n:''Keng teng fortuna fikah na Malaka,''\n:''Nang kereh partih bai otru tera.''\n:''Pra ki tudu jenti teng amizadi,''\n:''Kontu partih logu fikah saudadi.''\n\n:''Oh Malaka, tera di San Francisku,''\n:''Nteh otru tera ki yo kereh.''\n:''Oh Malaka undi teng sempri fresku,''\n:''Yo kereh fikah ateh mureh.''\n\n\nPortuguese translation:\n:''Quem tem fortuna fica em Malaca,''\n:''N\u00e3o quer partir para outra terra.''\n:''Por aqui toda a gente tem amizade,''\n:''Quando tu partes logo fica a saudade.''\n\n:''\u00d3 Malaca, terra de S\u00e3o Francisco,''\n:''N\u00e3o tem outra terra que eu queira.''\n:''\u00d3 Malaca, onde tem sempre frescura,''\n:''Eu quero ficar at\u00e9 morrer.''\n\n\nEnglish translation:\n:Who is lucky stays in Malacca,\n:Doesn't want to go to another land.\n:In here everyone has friendship,\n:When one leaves soon has ''[[saudade]]''.\n\n:Oh Malacca, land of Saint Francis,\n:There is no other land that I want.\n:Oh Malacca, where there's always freshness,\n:I want to stay here until I die.\n\n\nMalay translation:\n\n:Siapa beruntung tinggal di Melaka,\n:Tidak mahu ke tanah berbeza.\n:Di sini semua bersahabat,\n:Bila seorang pergi terasa rindu.\n\n:Oh Melaka, tanah Saint Francis,\n:Tiada tanah lain yang ku mahu.\n:Oh Melaka, dimana adanya kesegaran,\n:Aku mahu tinggal di sini hingga ke akhir nyawa.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Kristang_people|Kristang people]]\n*[[Eurasians in Singapore]]\n*[[Chavacano language]], a similar though [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-derived [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] creole\n*[[Batavia, Dutch East Indies]], as Kristang is also called Malacca\u2013Batavia Creole\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book |url=http://sealang.net/archives/pl/pdf/PL-B95.pdf |title=A Grammar of Kristang (Malacca Creole Portuguese) |last=Baxter |first=Alan N. |publisher=Pacific Linguistics |year=1988 |isbn=0-85883-375-1  |series=Pacific Linguistics Series B -

A Rajasthani mung bean paratha uses both the layering technique together with mung dal mixed into the dough. Some so-called ''stuffed parathas'' resemble a filled pie squashed flat and shallow fried, using two discs of dough sealed around the edges. Then by alternatively using a single disc of dough to encase a ball of filling and sealed with a series of pleats pinched into the dough around the top, gently flattened with the palm against the working surface before being rolled into a circle. Most stuffed parathas are not layered.\n\nParathas can be eaten as a breakfast dish or as a tea-time ([[tiffin]]) snack. The flour used is finely ground wholemeal ([[atta flour|atta]]) and the dough is shallow fried.\n\nPerhaps the most common stuffing for parathas is mashed, spiced potatoes (''aloo ka parantha'') followed perhaps by dal (lentils). Many other alternatives exist such as [[leaf vegetable]]s, [[radish]]es, [[cauliflower]] or [[paneer]].  A paratha (especially a stuffed one) can be eaten simply with a pat of butter spread on top or with chutney, pickles, ketchup, [[Yogurt|dahi]] or a [[raita]] or with meat or vegetable curries. Some roll the paratha into a tube and eat it with tea, often dipping the paratha.\n\nTo achieve the  [[laminated dough|layered dough]] for plain parathas, a number of different traditional techniques exist. These include covering the thinly rolled out pastry with oil, folding back and forth like a paper fan and coiling the resulting strip into a round shape before rolling flat, baking on the [[tava]] and shallow frying. Another method is to cut a circle of dough from the centre to its circumference along its radius, oiling the dough and starting at the cut edge rolling so as to form a cone which is then squashed into a disc shape and rolled out. The method of oiling and repeatedly folding the dough as in western puff pastry also exists, and this is combined with folding patterns that give traditional geometrical shapes to the finished parathas.  Plain parathas can be round, heptagonal, square, or triangular.\n\n== Serving ==\n\nThe paratha is an important part of a traditional breakfast from the Indian subcontinent. Traditionally, it is made using [[ghee]] but oil is also used. Some people may even bake it in the oven for health reasons. Usually, the paratha is eaten with dollops of white butter on top of it. Side dishes which go very well with paratha are curd, fried egg, omelette, mutton kheema (ground mutton cooked with vegetables and spices), [[nihari]] (a lamb dish), jeera aloo (potatoes lightly fried with cumin seeds), daal, and [[raita]] as part of a breakfast meal.

Expressing an interest in music from an early age, Knowles had several temporary stints as a backup dancer for [[Destiny's Child]], which featured her elder sister, [[Beyonc\u00e9]], among its members, before signing with her father [[Mathew Knowles]]'s [[Music World Entertainment]] label. At age 16, Knowles released her first studio album ''[[Solo Star]]'' (2002). Between 2005 and 2007, Knowles had several minor acting roles, including the direct-to-video ''[[Bring It On: All or Nothing]]'' (2006) and continued writing music for Beyonc\u00e9 and for former Destiny's Child group members [[Kelly Rowland]] and [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]].\n\nIn 2007, Knowles began to record music again. Her second studio album ''[[Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams]]'' (2008) deviated from the pop-oriented music of her debut to the Motown Sound of the 1960s and 1970s. It peaked at number nine on [[Billboard 200|US ''Billboard'' 200]] and received positive reviews from critics. She followed this up with the [[1980s music|1980s]] pop and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]\u2013inspired extended play ''[[True (EP)|True]]'' (2012) on [[Terrible Records]] and her imprint [[Saint Records]]. Her third studio album, ''[[A Seat at the Table]]'' (2016) was released to widespread critical acclaim and became her first number-one album in the United States. The album's lead single, \"[[Cranes in the Sky]]\" won the Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance|Best R&B Performance]]. Her fourth studio album, ''[[When I Get Home (album)|When I Get Home]]'', was released in 2019.\n\nKnowles was heavily influenced by [[Motown]] [[girl group]]s and says that her first passion is songwriting. She is frequently compared by the media to her sister, Beyonc\u00e9, but Solange insists they have different aspirations and are musically different.

Knowles countered by saying, \"It's good to have her advice, but we really have different goals\".<ref name=\"RamaswamySoul\"/> In her sister's self-titled album, Beyonc\u00e9 credits Knowles with the lyric \"my sister taught me I should speak my mind\", as she acknowledges the impact her family has made on her life.\n\nIn recent years, Knowles has also garnered considerable attention as a fashion icon. Her knack for bold colors, mixed prints and [[retro]] styles, as well as her knack for glamorous, fashion-forward looks in her music videography and public appearances, has become integral to her current image. She has been photographed wearing [[Alexander Wang (designer)|Alexander Wang]], [[Alexander McQueen]] and [[Chanel]]. The music video for her 2012 single \"Losing You\" featured a heavy demonstration of the contemporary sartorial movement throughout Africa, [[La Sape]].\n\nSimilarly, her decision to grow her [[Afro-textured hair|natural hair]] initially generated strong reactions from the public. In a cover interview with [[Toyin Ojih Odutola]] for Cultured Magazine, Knowles addressed her shift to minimalist fashion and the response she received from the public, \u201cThis idea that black women could not be minimalist, we could not be subtle\u2014 we have to be big, we have to be loud, we have to be an explosive presence.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.culturedmag.com/solange-knowles-toyin-ojih-odutola/|title=Solange Knowles and Toyin Ojih Odutola Talk Sound, Art and Architecture|date=February 19, 2018|website=Cultured Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=March 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAt the 2017 Glamour Women of the Year awards, Knowles wore a yellow [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]] couture gown and was named a Woman of the Year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/solange-knowles-glamour-magazine-women-woman-of-the-year-awards |title=Only Solange Could Pull Off This Bright Yellow Jean Paul Gaultier Gown |author=Rachel Hahn |website=www.vogue.com |date=November 15, 2017|access-date=November 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\nKnowles is an activist for the Black Lives Matter movement and has openly made many statements in opposition to police brutality against African Americans.  On the day of the mass shooting at the Emanuel AME church in Charleston, South Carolina, Solange released a statement posing the following questions: \"Where can we be safe? Where can we be free? Where can we be black?\" Knowles has stated on several occasions that as a black woman, she is \"not really allowed to be mad\" without enforcing racial stereotypes, however, she has \"a lot to be mad about\".\n\nIn July 2016, she took to Twitter to critique police who were present at a peaceful protest in Baton Rouge, saying \"Protesters/marchers have been nothing but peaceful today in Baton Rouge. Police are here pulling out tear gas while children are around\" and  \"Most of the march/protest speakers in Baton Rouge were all under 17 years old... We all left feeling uplifted...Yet as I walked back to my car I personally saw @BRPD pulling huge assault rifles out on peaceful protesters....\"\n\nHer 2016 album, ''A Seat at The Table'', acknowledges the inequalities that black women face in America.  With songs like \"Mad\", \"Don't Touch My Hair\", and \"F.U.B.U\", Knowles addresses stereotypes of young, black Americans, such as criminality or the fixation people have on black women's natural hair, saying she's \"got the right to be mad\".\n\n==Other ventures==\nIn 2001, Knowles collaborated with Destiny's Child to sing the theme song for the Disney Channel show ''The Proud Family''.\n\nIn 2007, Knowles began promoting Baby Jamz, a [[hip hop]]-styled toy line for pre-schoolers.<ref name=\"Co-Publishing Deal\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/2008/06/17/2008-06-17_sister_act_solange_knowles_beyonces_youn.html|title=Sister act: Solange Knowles, Beyonce's younger sibling, comes into her own|last=Smith|first=Olivia|date=June 17, 2008|work=[[New York Daily News]]|accessdate=December 11, 2008}}</ref> It was inspired by her son, Julez, who is fond of hip hop music.<ref name=\"EdwardsFlying\" /> She is the executive producer of the CD, composed of updated hip hop inspired nursery rhymes, which is featured in all of the toys.<ref name=\"Co-Publishing Deal\" />\n\nIn 2008, Knowles was named as ambassador for [[Giorgio Armani]]'s younger diffusion line, Armani Jeans.

Expressing an interest in music from an early age, Knowles had several temporary stints as a backup dancer for [[Destiny's Child]], which featured her elder sister, [[Beyonc\u00e9]], among its members, before signing with her father [[Mathew Knowles]]'s [[Music World Entertainment]] label. At age 16, Knowles released her first studio album ''[[Solo Star]]'' (2002). Between 2005 and 2007, Knowles had several minor acting roles, including the direct-to-video ''[[Bring It On: All or Nothing]]'' (2006) and continued writing music for Beyonc\u00e9 and for former Destiny's Child group members [[Kelly Rowland]] and [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]].\n\nIn 2007, Knowles began to record music again. Her second studio album ''[[Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams]]'' (2008) deviated from the pop-oriented music of her debut to the Motown Sound of the 1960s and 1970s. It peaked at number nine on [[Billboard 200|US ''Billboard'' 200]] and received positive reviews from critics. She followed this up with the [[1980s music|1980s]] pop and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]\u2013inspired extended play ''[[True (EP)|True]]'' (2012) on [[Terrible Records]] and her imprint [[Saint Records]]. Her third studio album, ''[[A Seat at the Table]]'' (2016) was released to widespread critical acclaim and became her first number-one album in the United States. The album's lead single, \"[[Cranes in the Sky]]\" won the Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance|Best R&B Performance]]. Her fourth studio album, ''[[When I Get Home (album)|When I Get Home]]'', was released in 2019.\n\nKnowles was heavily influenced by [[Motown]] [[girl group]]s and says that her first passion is songwriting. She is frequently compared by the media to her sister, Beyonc\u00e9, but Solange insists they have different aspirations and are musically different.

Knowles countered by saying, \"It's good to have her advice, but we really have different goals\".<ref name=\"RamaswamySoul\"/> In her sister's self-titled album, Beyonc\u00e9 credits Knowles with the lyric \"my sister taught me I should speak my mind\", as she acknowledges the impact her family has made on her life.\n\nIn recent years, Knowles has also garnered considerable attention as a fashion icon. Her knack for bold colors, mixed prints and [[retro]] styles, as well as her knack for glamorous, fashion-forward looks in her music videography and public appearances, has become integral to her current image. She has been photographed wearing [[Alexander Wang (designer)|Alexander Wang]], [[Alexander McQueen]] and [[Chanel]]. The music video for her 2012 single \"Losing You\" featured a heavy demonstration of the contemporary sartorial movement throughout Africa, [[La Sape]].\n\nSimilarly, her decision to grow her [[Afro-textured hair|natural hair]] initially generated strong reactions from the public. In a cover interview with [[Toyin Ojih Odutola]] for Cultured Magazine, Knowles addressed her shift to minimalist fashion and the response she received from the public, \u201cThis idea that black women could not be minimalist, we could not be subtle\u2014 we have to be big, we have to be loud, we have to be an explosive presence.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.culturedmag.com/solange-knowles-toyin-ojih-odutola/|title=Solange Knowles and Toyin Ojih Odutola Talk Sound, Art and Architecture|date=February 19, 2018|website=Cultured Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=March 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAt the 2017 Glamour Women of the Year awards, Knowles wore a yellow [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]] couture gown and was named a Woman of the Year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/solange-knowles-glamour-magazine-women-woman-of-the-year-awards |title=Only Solange Could Pull Off This Bright Yellow Jean Paul Gaultier Gown |author=Rachel Hahn |website=www.vogue.com |date=November 15, 2017|access-date=November 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\nKnowles is an activist for the Black Lives Matter movement and has openly made many statements in opposition to police brutality against African Americans.  On the day of the mass shooting at the Emanuel AME church in Charleston, South Carolina, Solange released a statement posing the following questions: \"Where can we be safe? Where can we be free? Where can we be black?\" Knowles has stated on several occasions that as a black woman, she is \"not really allowed to be mad\" without enforcing racial stereotypes, however, she has \"a lot to be mad about\".\n\nIn July 2016, she took to Twitter to critique police who were present at a peaceful protest in Baton Rouge, saying \"Protesters/marchers have been nothing but peaceful today in Baton Rouge. Police are here pulling out tear gas while children are around\" and  \"Most of the march/protest speakers in Baton Rouge were all under 17 years old... We all left feeling uplifted...Yet as I walked back to my car I personally saw @BRPD pulling huge assault rifles out on peaceful protesters....\"\n\nHer 2016 album, ''A Seat at The Table'', acknowledges the inequalities that black women face in America.  With songs like \"Mad\", \"Don't Touch My Hair\", and \"F.U.B.U\", Knowles addresses stereotypes of young, black Americans, such as criminality or the fixation people have on black women's natural hair, saying she's \"got the right to be mad\".\n\n==Other ventures==\nIn 2001, Knowles collaborated with Destiny's Child to sing the theme song for the Disney Channel show ''The Proud Family''.\n\nIn 2007, Knowles began promoting Baby Jamz, a [[hip hop]]-styled toy line for pre-schoolers.<ref name=\"Co-Publishing Deal\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/2008/06/17/2008-06-17_sister_act_solange_knowles_beyonces_youn.html|title=Sister act: Solange Knowles, Beyonce's younger sibling, comes into her own|last=Smith|first=Olivia|date=June 17, 2008|work=[[New York Daily News]]|accessdate=December 11, 2008}}</ref> It was inspired by her son, Julez, who is fond of hip hop music.<ref name=\"EdwardsFlying\" /> She is the executive producer of the CD, composed of updated hip hop inspired nursery rhymes, which is featured in all of the toys.<ref name=\"Co-Publishing Deal\" />\n\nIn 2008, Knowles was named as ambassador for [[Giorgio Armani]]'s younger diffusion line, Armani Jeans.

A dated term in [[German language|German]], {{lang|de|Lenz}} ([[Old High German]] {{lang|goh|lenzo}}), is also related. According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 'the shorter form (? Old Germanic type *''la\u014bgito''- , *''la\u014bgiton''-) seems to be a derivative of *''la\u014bgo''- long ... and may possibly have reference to the lengthening of the days as characterizing the season of spring'. The origin of the -''en'' element is less clear: it may simply be a [[suffix]], or ''lencten'' may originally have been a compound of *''la\u014bgo''- 'long' and an otherwise little-attested word *-''tino'', meaning 'day'.<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Lent |volume=16|page=427}}</ref>\n\nIn languages spoken where Christianity was earlier established, such as [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]], the term signifies the period dating from the 40th day before Easter. In modern Greek the term is {{lang|el|\u03a3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae}} (''Sarakost\u00ed''), derived from the earlier {{lang|el|\u03a4\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae}} (''Tessarakost\u00ed''), meaning \"fortieth\". The corresponding word in [[Latin]], {{lang|la|quadragesima}} (\"fortieth\"), is the origin of the terms used in Latin-derived languages and in some others.

There are three prevailing theories: One, that it was created at the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicea]] in 325 and there is no earlier incarnation. Two, that it is based on an Egyptian post-[[theophany]] fast. Three, a combination of origins syncretized around the Council of Nicea.<ref>https://www.baylor.edu/content/services/document.php/193181.pdf</ref>\n{{expand section|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Duration and traditions==\n{{Lent_calendar.svg|400px|Some}}\nVarious Christian [[Christian denomination|denominations]] calculate the 40 days of Lent differently. The way they observe Lent also differs.\n\n===Roman Catholicism===\nIn the Roman Rite since 1970, Lent starts on Ash Wednesday and ends on Holy Thursday Evening (before the Evening Mass of the Lord's Supper).

Great Lent is broken only after the Paschal (Easter) Divine Liturgy.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church maintains the traditional Church's teaching on fasting. The rules for lenten fasting are the monastic rules. Fasting in the Orthodox Church is more than simply abstaining from certain foods. During the Great Lent Orthodox Faithful intensify their prayers and spiritual exercises, go to church services more often, study the Scriptures and the works of the [[Church Fathers]] in depth, limit their entertainment and spendings and focus on charity and good works.\n\n===Oriental Orthodoxy===\nAmong the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], there are various local traditions regarding Lent.

Saint Martin's parish, [[W\u00fcrttemberg]], Germany]]\nIn certain pious [[Christian state]]s, in which liturgical forms of Christianity predominate, religious objects were traditionally veiled for the entire 40 days of Lent. Though perhaps uncommon in the United States of America, this pious practice is consistently observed in [[Goa, India|Goa]], Malta, Peru, the Philippines (the latter only for the entire duration of Holy Week, with the exception of processional images), and in the Spanish cities: [[Barcelona]], [[M\u00e1laga]], and [[Seville]]. In Ireland, before [[Vatican II]], when impoverished rural Catholic convents and parishes could not afford purple fabrics, they resorted to either removing the statues altogether or, if too heavy or bothersome, turned the statues to face the wall. As is popular custom, the 14 [[Stations of the Cross]] plaques on the walls are not veiled.\n\nCrosses were often adorned with jewels and gemstones, the form referred to as ''Crux Gemmata''. To keep the faithful from adoring the crucifixes elaborated with ornamentation, veiling it in royal purple fabrics came into place. The violet colour later evolved as a color of penance and mourning.\n\nFurther liturgical changes in modernity reduced such observances to the last week of [[Passiontide]]. In parishes that could afford only small quantities of violet fabrics, only the heads of the statues were veiled. If no violet fabrics could be afforded at all, then the religious statues and images were turned around facing the wall. Flowers were always removed as a sign of solemn mourning.\n\nIn the [[Book of Worship for Church and Home (1965)|pre-1992 Methodist liturgy]] and pre-1970 forms of the Roman Rite, the last two weeks of Lent are known as [[Passiontide]], a period beginning on the Fifth Sunday in Lent, which in the 1962 edition of the [[Roman Missal]] is called the First Sunday in Passiontide and in earlier editions Passion Sunday. All statues (and in England paintings as well) in the church were traditionally veiled in violet. This was seen as in keeping with the Gospel of that Sunday ({{bibleverse||John|8:46\u201359}}), in which Jesus \"hid himself\" from the people.\n\nWithin many churches in the United States of America, after the Second Vatican Council, the need to veil statues or crosses became increasingly irrelevant and was deemed unnecessary by some [[diocesan]] bishops. As a result, the veils were removed at the singing of the [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo]] during the Easter Vigil. In 1970, the name \"Passiontide\" was dropped, although the last two weeks are markedly different from the rest of the season, and continuance of the tradition of veiling images is left to the discretion of a country's conference of bishops or even to individual parishes as pastors may wish.\n\nOn [[Good Friday]], the Anglican, Lutheran, and Methodist churches traditionally veiled \"all pictures, statutes, and the cross are covered in mourning black\", while \"the chancel and altar coverings are replaced with black, and altar candles are extinguished\". The fabrics are then \"replaced with white on [[sunrise]] on [[Easter Sunday]]\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Bratcher|first=Dennis|title=The Days of Holy Week|url=http://www.crivoice.org/cyholyweek.html|publisher=CRI|year=2015}}</ref>\n\n==Pre-Lenten festivals==\n{{Main|Shrovetide}}\n{{Further|Carnival|Mardi Gras|Swabian-Alemannic-Fastnacht|Maslenitsa|Pancake Day|Baklahorani}}\n\nThe carnival celebrations which in many cultures traditionally precede Lent are seen as a last opportunity for excess before Lent begins. Some of the most famous are the [[Carnival of Barranquilla]], the [[Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]], the [[Carnival of Venice]], [[Cologne Carnival]], the [[New Orleans Mardi Gras]], the [[Rio de Janeiro carnival]], and the [[Trinidad and Tobago Carnival]].\n\nThe day immediately preceding Lent is variously called [[Mardi Gras]] (\"[[Fat Tuesday]]\"), [[Pancake Tuesday]], or [[Shrove Tuesday]].  Sometimes, it is the peak of the pre-Lenten festival, while sometimes it is largely occupied with preparations for Lent.

After this celebration, the consecrated [[host (liturgy)|Hosts]] are taken solemnly from the altar to a place of reposition, where the faithful are invited to meditate in the presence of the consecrated Hosts.This is the Church's response to Jesus' question to the disciples sleeping in the [[Gethsemane|Garden of Gethsemane]], \"Could you not watch with me one hour?\" On the next day, the liturgical commemoration of the Passion of Jesus Christ is celebrated at 3&nbsp;pm, unless a later time is chosen due to work schedules.\n\nThis service consists of readings from the [[Bible|Scriptures]], especially [[John the Evangelist]]'s account of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] of Jesus, followed by prayers, veneration of the cross of Jesus, and a communion service at which the hosts consecrated at the evening Mass of the day before are distributed. The [[Easter Vigil]] during the night between Holy Saturday afternoon and Easter Sunday morning starts with the blessing of a fire and a special candle, and with readings from Scripture associated with [[baptism]]. Then, the [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo]] is sung, water is blessed, baptism and [[confirmation]] of adults may take place, the people are invited to renew the promises of their own baptism, and finally, Mass is celebrated in the usual way from the Preparation of the Gifts onwards.\n\nHoly Week and the season of Lent, depending on [[Christian denomination|denomination]] and local [[Convention (norm)|custom]], end with Easter Vigil at sundown on Holy Saturday or on the morning of Easter Sunday. It is custom for some churches to hold sunrise services which include open air celebrations in some places.\n\n==Vestments==\n[[File:Chancel on Maundy Thursday.jpg|thumb|The [[chancel]] of a [[Lutheran]] church decorated with red [[parament]]s, the liturgical colour of the last week of Lent, [[Holy Week]], in the Lutheran and Anglican Churches<ref name=\"Gally1989\">{{cite book|last=Gally|first=Howard E.|title=Ceremonies of the Eucharist|year= 1989|publisher=Cowley Publications|language=English|isbn=978-1461660521|page=45|quote=In recent decades there has been a revival of the ancient use of red (crimson or scarlet) for Holy Week among both Episcopalians and Lutherans.

Roman Catholic priests wear white vestments on solemnity days for St. Joseph (March 19) and the Annunciation (March 25), although these solemnities get transferred to another date if they fall on a Sunday in Lent or at any time during Holy Week.  On the fourth Sunday in Lent, rose-coloured (pink) vestments may be worn in lieu of violet. Historically, black had also been used: [[Pope Innocent III]] declared black to be the proper color for Lent, though [[Durandus of Saint-Pour\u00e7ain]] claims violet has preference over black.<ref>Kellner, K. A. H. (1908).

If the Collect, Readings, etc. on a Lesser Festival are those of the saint, then either red (for a martyr) or white is used; otherwise, the colour of the season is retained.\" See [http://www.churchofengland.org/media/41133/mvlectionary524-591.pdf p. 532 here].</ref> In certain other Anglican churches, as an alternative to violet for all of Lent except Holy Week and red beginning on Palm Sunday through Holy Saturday, Lenten array, typically made of sackcloth such as burlap and trimmed with crimson cloth, often velvet, is worn, even during Holy Week\u2014since the sackcloth represents penance and the crimson edges represent the Passion of Christ.  Even the veils that cover the altar crosses or crucifixes and statuary (if any) are made of the same sackcloth with the crimson trim.\n\n==See also==\n'''Christianity:'''\n*[[Eastern Orthodox Church#Fasting|Fasting in the Eastern Orthodox Church]]\n*[[Fasting and abstinence in the Catholic Church]]\n*[[Fasting and abstinence of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]\n*[[Fast of Nineveh]]\n*[[People's Sunday]]\n*[[Penance]]\n*[[Quinquagesima]]\n*[[Daniel Fast]]\n\n'''Islam:'''\n*[[Ramadan]]\n\n'''Judaism:'''\n*[[Counting of the Omer]]\n*[[Tisha B'Av]]\n*[[Yom Kippur]]\n\n'''Modern interpretations'''\n*[[Lent Event]], asks people to donate the value of what they forego during Lent\n\n'''General:'''\n*[[Asceticism]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Lent (fasting period)}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{Wiktionary|Lent}}\n*[https://www.lhm.org/lent/ Daily Lenten Devotional \u2013 Lutheran Hour Ministries]\t\n*[http://www.methodist.org.uk/lentandeaster Methodist Church: Lent and Easter Resources]\n*[http://www.simplycatholic.com/your-guide-to-a-catholic-lent-everything-you-need-for-a-more-spiritual-lent/ Simply Catholic \u2013 Your Guide to a Catholic Lent: Everything You Need for a More Spiritual Lent]\n\n{{Easter}}\n{{Liturgical year of the Catholic Church}}\n\n[[Category:Lent| ]]\n[[Category:Christian terminology]]\n[[Category:Christian fasting]]\n[[Category:March observances]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the Western Christian 40-day period|Lent in Eastern Christianity|Great Lent|other uses}}\n[[File:High Altar of Palmer Memorial Episcopal Church during Lent.jpg|thumb|The [[liturgical colour]] of the season of Lent is purple.

A dated term in [[German language|German]], {{lang|de|Lenz}} ([[Old High German]] {{lang|goh|lenzo}}), is also related. According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 'the shorter form (? Old Germanic type *''la\u014bgito''- , *''la\u014bgiton''-) seems to be a derivative of *''la\u014bgo''- long ... and may possibly have reference to the lengthening of the days as characterizing the season of spring'. The origin of the -''en'' element is less clear: it may simply be a [[suffix]], or ''lencten'' may originally have been a compound of *''la\u014bgo''- 'long' and an otherwise little-attested word *-''tino'', meaning 'day'.<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Lent |volume=16|page=427}}</ref>\n\nIn languages spoken where Christianity was earlier established, such as [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]], the term signifies the period dating from the 40th day before Easter. In modern Greek the term is {{lang|el|\u03a3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae}} (''Sarakost\u00ed''), derived from the earlier {{lang|el|\u03a4\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae}} (''Tessarakost\u00ed''), meaning \"fortieth\". The corresponding word in [[Latin]], {{lang|la|quadragesima}} (\"fortieth\"), is the origin of the terms used in Latin-derived languages and in some others. Examples in the [[Romance languages|Romance language]] group are: [[Catalan language|Catalan]] {{lang|ca|quaresma}}, [[French language|French]] {{lang|fr|car\u00eame}}, [[Galician language|Galician]] {{lang | gl | coresma}}, [[Italian language|Italian]] {{lang|it|quaresima}}, [[Occitan language|Occitan]] {{lang|oc|quaresma}}, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] {{lang|pt|quaresma}}, [[Romanian language|Romanian]] {{lang|ro|p\u0103resimi}}, [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] {{lang|sc|caresima}}, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] {{lang|es|cuaresma}}, and [[Walloon language|Walloon]] {{lang|wa|cwareme}}.

There are three prevailing theories: One, that it was created at the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicea]] in 325 and there is no earlier incarnation. Two, that it is based on an Egyptian post-[[theophany]] fast. Three, a combination of origins syncretized around the Council of Nicea.<ref>https://www.baylor.edu/content/services/document.php/193181.pdf</ref>\n{{expand section|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Duration and traditions==\n{{Lent_calendar.svg|400px|Some}}\nVarious Christian [[Christian denomination|denominations]] calculate the 40 days of Lent differently.

Great Lent is broken only after the Paschal (Easter) Divine Liturgy.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church maintains the traditional Church's teaching on fasting. The rules for lenten fasting are the monastic rules. Fasting in the Orthodox Church is more than simply abstaining from certain foods. During the Great Lent Orthodox Faithful intensify their prayers and spiritual exercises, go to church services more often, study the Scriptures and the works of the [[Church Fathers]] in depth, limit their entertainment and spendings and focus on charity and good works.\n\n===Oriental Orthodoxy===\nAmong the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], there are various local traditions regarding Lent.

Saint Martin's parish, [[W\u00fcrttemberg]], Germany]]\nIn certain pious [[Christian state]]s, in which liturgical forms of Christianity predominate, religious objects were traditionally veiled for the entire 40 days of Lent. Though perhaps uncommon in the United States of America, this pious practice is consistently observed in [[Goa, India|Goa]], Malta, Peru, the Philippines (the latter only for the entire duration of Holy Week, with the exception of processional images), and in the Spanish cities: [[Barcelona]], [[M\u00e1laga]], and [[Seville]]. In Ireland, before [[Vatican II]], when impoverished rural Catholic convents and parishes could not afford purple fabrics, they resorted to either removing the statues altogether or, if too heavy or bothersome, turned the statues to face the wall. As is popular custom, the 14 [[Stations of the Cross]] plaques on the walls are not veiled.\n\nCrosses were often adorned with jewels and gemstones, the form referred to as ''Crux Gemmata''. To keep the faithful from adoring the crucifixes elaborated with ornamentation, veiling it in royal purple fabrics came into place. The violet colour later evolved as a color of penance and mourning.\n\nFurther liturgical changes in modernity reduced such observances to the last week of [[Passiontide]]. In parishes that could afford only small quantities of violet fabrics, only the heads of the statues were veiled. If no violet fabrics could be afforded at all, then the religious statues and images were turned around facing the wall. Flowers were always removed as a sign of solemn mourning.\n\nIn the [[Book of Worship for Church and Home (1965)|pre-1992 Methodist liturgy]] and pre-1970 forms of the Roman Rite, the last two weeks of Lent are known as [[Passiontide]], a period beginning on the Fifth Sunday in Lent, which in the 1962 edition of the [[Roman Missal]] is called the First Sunday in Passiontide and in earlier editions Passion Sunday. All statues (and in England paintings as well) in the church were traditionally veiled in violet. This was seen as in keeping with the Gospel of that Sunday ({{bibleverse||John|8:46\u201359}}), in which Jesus \"hid himself\" from the people.\n\nWithin many churches in the United States of America, after the Second Vatican Council, the need to veil statues or crosses became increasingly irrelevant and was deemed unnecessary by some [[diocesan]] bishops. As a result, the veils were removed at the singing of the [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo]] during the Easter Vigil. In 1970, the name \"Passiontide\" was dropped, although the last two weeks are markedly different from the rest of the season, and continuance of the tradition of veiling images is left to the discretion of a country's conference of bishops or even to individual parishes as pastors may wish.\n\nOn [[Good Friday]], the Anglican, Lutheran, and Methodist churches traditionally veiled \"all pictures, statutes, and the cross are covered in mourning black\", while \"the chancel and altar coverings are replaced with black, and altar candles are extinguished\". The fabrics are then \"replaced with white on [[sunrise]] on [[Easter Sunday]]\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Bratcher|first=Dennis|title=The Days of Holy Week|url=http://www.crivoice.org/cyholyweek.html|publisher=CRI|year=2015}}</ref>\n\n==Pre-Lenten festivals==\n{{Main|Shrovetide}}\n{{Further|Carnival|Mardi Gras|Swabian-Alemannic-Fastnacht|Maslenitsa|Pancake Day|Baklahorani}}\n\nThe carnival celebrations which in many cultures traditionally precede Lent are seen as a last opportunity for excess before Lent begins.

Sometimes, it is the peak of the pre-Lenten festival, while sometimes it is largely occupied with preparations for Lent.  The observances vary from culture to culture, and even from town to town.\n\nOriginally, in Lebanon and Syria, the last Thursday preceding Lent was called \"Khamis el zakara\". For Catholics, it was meant to be a day of remembrance of the dead ones. However, ''zakara'' (which means \"remembrance\", in Arabic) was gradually replaced by ''sakara'' (meaning \"getting drunk\" in Arabic), and so the occasion came to be known as ''[[Khamis el sakara]]'', wherein celebrants indulge themselves with [[alcoholic beverage]]s.\n\n{{anchor|lenten foods}}\n\n==Fasting and abstinence==\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Jesus Tempted in the Wilderness (J\u00e9sus tent\u00e9 dans le d\u00e9sert) - James Tissot - overall.jpg|thumb|''Jesus Tempted in the Wilderness (J\u00e9sus tent\u00e9 dans le d\u00e9sert)'', [[James Tissot]], [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\n{{further|Fasting#Christianity|Christian dietary laws}}\nFasting during Lent was more prominent in ancient times than today.

After this celebration, the consecrated [[host (liturgy)|Hosts]] are taken solemnly from the altar to a place of reposition, where the faithful are invited to meditate in the presence of the consecrated Hosts.This is the Church's response to Jesus' question to the disciples sleeping in the [[Gethsemane|Garden of Gethsemane]], \"Could you not watch with me one hour?\" On the next day, the liturgical commemoration of the Passion of Jesus Christ is celebrated at 3&nbsp;pm, unless a later time is chosen due to work schedules.\n\nThis service consists of readings from the [[Bible|Scriptures]], especially [[John the Evangelist]]'s account of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] of Jesus, followed by prayers, veneration of the cross of Jesus, and a communion service at which the hosts consecrated at the evening Mass of the day before are distributed. The [[Easter Vigil]] during the night between Holy Saturday afternoon and Easter Sunday morning starts with the blessing of a fire and a special candle, and with readings from Scripture associated with [[baptism]]. Then, the [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo]] is sung, water is blessed, baptism and [[confirmation]] of adults may take place, the people are invited to renew the promises of their own baptism, and finally, Mass is celebrated in the usual way from the Preparation of the Gifts onwards.\n\nHoly Week and the season of Lent, depending on [[Christian denomination|denomination]] and local [[Convention (norm)|custom]], end with Easter Vigil at sundown on Holy Saturday or on the morning of Easter Sunday. It is custom for some churches to hold sunrise services which include open air celebrations in some places.\n\n==Vestments==\n[[File:Chancel on Maundy Thursday.jpg|thumb|The [[chancel]] of a [[Lutheran]] church decorated with red [[parament]]s, the liturgical colour of the last week of Lent, [[Holy Week]], in the Lutheran and Anglican Churches<ref name=\"Gally1989\">{{cite book|last=Gally|first=Howard E.|title=Ceremonies of the Eucharist|year= 1989|publisher=Cowley Publications|language=English|isbn=978-1461660521|page=45|quote=In recent decades there has been a revival of the ancient use of red (crimson or scarlet) for Holy Week among both Episcopalians and Lutherans. The Roman rite has restored the use of red only on Palm Sunday and Good Friday.}}</ref>]]\nIn the Lutheran, Methodist, Reformed, Roman Catholic, and many Anglican churches, the pastor's vestments are violet during the season of Lent. Roman Catholic priests wear white vestments on solemnity days for St. Joseph (March 19) and the Annunciation (March 25), although these solemnities get transferred to another date if they fall on a Sunday in Lent or at any time during Holy Week.  On the fourth Sunday in Lent, rose-coloured (pink) vestments may be worn in lieu of violet. Historically, black had also been used: [[Pope Innocent III]] declared black to be the proper color for Lent, though [[Durandus of Saint-Pour\u00e7ain]] claims violet has preference over black.<ref>Kellner, K. A. H. (1908).

If the Collect, Readings, etc. on a Lesser Festival are those of the saint, then either red (for a martyr) or white is used; otherwise, the colour of the season is retained.\" See [http://www.churchofengland.org/media/41133/mvlectionary524-591.pdf p. 532 here].</ref> In certain other Anglican churches, as an alternative to violet for all of Lent except Holy Week and red beginning on Palm Sunday through Holy Saturday, Lenten array, typically made of sackcloth such as burlap and trimmed with crimson cloth, often velvet, is worn, even during Holy Week\u2014since the sackcloth represents penance and the crimson edges represent the Passion of Christ.  Even the veils that cover the altar crosses or crucifixes and statuary (if any) are made of the same sackcloth with the crimson trim.\n\n==See also==\n'''Christianity:'''\n*[[Eastern Orthodox Church#Fasting|Fasting in the Eastern Orthodox Church]]\n*[[Fasting and abstinence in the Catholic Church]]\n*[[Fasting and abstinence of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]\n*[[Fast of Nineveh]]\n*[[People's Sunday]]\n*[[Penance]]\n*[[Quinquagesima]]\n*[[Daniel Fast]]\n\n'''Islam:'''\n*[[Ramadan]]\n\n'''Judaism:'''\n*[[Counting of the Omer]]\n*[[Tisha B'Av]]\n*[[Yom Kippur]]\n\n'''Modern interpretations'''\n*[[Lent Event]], asks people to donate the value of what they forego during Lent\n\n'''General:'''\n*[[Asceticism]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Lent (fasting period)}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{Wiktionary|Lent}}\n*[https://www.lhm.org/lent/ Daily Lenten Devotional \u2013 Lutheran Hour Ministries]\t\n*[http://www.methodist.org.uk/lentandeaster Methodist Church: Lent and Easter Resources]\n*[http://www.simplycatholic.com/your-guide-to-a-catholic-lent-everything-you-need-for-a-more-spiritual-lent/ Simply Catholic \u2013 Your Guide to a Catholic Lent: Everything You Need for a More Spiritual Lent]\n\n{{Easter}}\n{{Liturgical year of the Catholic Church}}\n\n[[Category:Lent| ]]\n[[Category:Christian terminology]]\n[[Category:Christian fasting]]\n[[Category:March observances]]\n", "name_user": "79.66.239.229", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(I change the festivel)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lent"}
