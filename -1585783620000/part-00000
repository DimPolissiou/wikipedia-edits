The [[Ohio and Erie Canal]] brought passengers, freight and a means to transport grain to market. The first canal boat floated through Winchester in 1831. The village was named Canal Winchester when the post office was established in 1841, because there were five other locations in the state named [[Winchester, Ohio (disambiguation)|Winchester]].<ref name= cwh />\n\nA local legend explains how Canal Winchester received its post office. On Halloween, October 31, 1841, two teenage boys, as a prank, hooked two horses up to the foundation of the post office of the town of Waterloo and then pulled it across the street to Winchester.{{Citation needed|date= March 2018}} With this, the town of Waterloo was no more and Winchester was a legitimate village. The village was annexed to Madison Township, Franklin County, in 1851.\n\nIn May 1866, the Ohio Secretary of State granted incorporation papers for the Village of Canal Winchester. In 1869, the railroad came to Canal Winchester, bringing continued prosperity.\n\n==Geography==\nCanal Winchester is located at {{coord|39|50|46|N|82|48|42|W|type:city}} (39.845977, -82.811675).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the village has a total area of {{convert|7.61|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|7.47|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.14|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web |title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2013-01-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702145235/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=2012-07-02 }}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nClimate is characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year.

The [[Ohio and Erie Canal]] brought passengers, freight and a means to transport grain to market. The first canal boat floated through Winchester in 1831. The village was named Canal Winchester when the post office was established in 1841, because there were five other locations in the state named [[Winchester, Ohio (disambiguation)|Winchester]].<ref name= cwh />\n\nA local legend explains how Canal Winchester received its post office. On Halloween, October 31, 1841, two teenage boys, as a prank, hooked two horses up to the foundation of the post office of the town of Waterloo and then pulled it across the street to Winchester.{{Citation needed|date= March 2018}} With this, the town of Waterloo was no more and Winchester was a legitimate village. The village was annexed to Madison Township, Franklin County, in 1851.\n\nIn May 1866, the Ohio Secretary of State granted incorporation papers for the Village of Canal Winchester. In 1869, the railroad came to Canal Winchester, bringing continued prosperity.\n\n==Geography==\nCanal Winchester is located at {{coord|39|50|46|N|82|48|42|W|type:city}} (39.845977, -82.811675).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the village has a total area of {{convert|7.61|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|7.47|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.14|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web |title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2013-01-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702145235/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=2012-07-02 }}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nClimate is characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year.

It always was constrained by the powerful example of the increasingly prosperous West, to which East Germans compared their nation. The changes wrought by the Communists were most apparent in ending capitalism and transforming industry and agriculture, in the militarization of society, and in the political thrust of the educational system and the media. On the other hand, there was relatively little change made in the historically independent domains of the sciences, the engineering professions, the Protestant churches, and in many bourgeois lifestyles.

Disagreements over the policies to be followed in the occupied zones quickly led to a breakdown in cooperation between the four powers, and the Soviets administered their zone without regard to the policies implemented in the other zones.

Both countries were admitted into the United Nations on 18 September 1973. This also increased the number of countries recognizing East Germany to 55, including the US, UK and France, though these three still refused to recognize East Berlin as the capital, and insisted on a specific provision in the UN resolution accepting the two Germanys into the UN to that effect.<ref name=\"time\"/>  Following the Ostpolitik the West German view was that East Germany was a ''de facto'' government within a single German nation and a ''de jure'' state organisation of parts of Germany outside the Federal Republic. The Federal Republic continued to maintain that it could not within its own structures recognize the GDR ''de jure'' as a sovereign state under international law; but it fully acknowledged that, within the structures of international law, the GDR was an independent sovereign state. By distinction, West Germany then viewed itself as being within its own boundaries, not only the ''de facto'' and ''de jure'' government, but also the sole ''de jure'' legitimate representative of a dormant \"Germany as whole\".<ref>{{citation |first=Peter E. |last=Quint |title=The Imperfect Union; Constitutional Structures for German Unification |year = 1991 |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=14 }}</ref>  The two Germanys relinquished any claim to represent the other internationally; which they acknowledged as necessarily implying a mutual recognition of each other as both capable of representing their own populations ''de jure'' in participating in international bodies and agreements, such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[Helsinki Accords|Helsinki Final Act]].\n\nThis assessment of the Basic Treaty was confirmed in a decision of the [[Federal Constitutional Court]] in 1973;<ref>{{citation |first=Donald P. |last=Kommers |title=The Constitutional Jursiprudence of the Federal Republic of Germany |year=2012 |publisher=Duke University Press |page= 308 }}</ref>\n{{quote|the German Democratic Republic is in the international-law sense a State and as such a subject of international law.

If the conduct of the Federal Republic of Germany towards the German Democratic Republic is assessed in the light of its d\u00e9tente policy, in particular the conclusion of the Treaty as de facto recognition, then it can only be understood as de facto recognition of a special kind.

The impetus for this exodus of East Germans was the removal of the electrified fence along [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]]'s border with [[Austria]] on 2 May. Although formally the Hungarian frontier was still closed, many East Germans took the opportunity to enter the country via [[Czechoslovakia]], and then make the illegal crossing from Hungary into Austria and West Germany beyond.<ref name=\"Judt\" /> By July, 25,000 East Germans had crossed into Hungary,<ref>[https://archive.is/20050419213613/http://www.germannotes.com/hist_east_wall.shtml The Berlin Wall (1961\u201389)] German Notes.

The major turning point in the exodus came on 10 September, when the Hungarian Foreign Minister [[Gyula Horn]] announced that his country would no longer restrict movement from Hungary into Austria.

To try to stem the outward flow of the population, the SED proposed a concessionary law loosening restrictions on travel.

Krenz resigned a few days later, and the SED opened negotiations with the leaders of the incipient Democratic movement, [[Neues Forum]], to schedule free elections and begin the process of democratization. As part of this, the SED eliminated the clause in the East German constitution guaranteeing the Communists leadership of the state. This was approved in the ''Volkskammer'' on 1 December 1989 by a vote of 420 to 0.<ref name=\"Postwar\">{{cite book |title = Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945 |first = Tony |last = Judt |year = 2005 |page = 615 }}</ref>\n\nEast Germany held [[East German general election, 1990|its last elections in March 1990]]. The winner was a coalition headed by the East German branch of West Germany's [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]], which advocated speedy reunification. Negotiations ([[Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany|2+4]] Talks) were held involving the two German states and the former [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] which led to agreement on the conditions for German unification. By a two-thirds vote in the ''[[Volkskammer]]'' on 23 August 1990, the German Democratic Republic declared its accession to the Federal Republic of Germany. The five original [[New states of Germany|East German states]] that had been abolished in the 1952 redistricting were restored.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> On 3 October 1990, the five states officially joined the Federal Republic of Germany, while East and West Berlin united as a third city-state (in the same manner as [[Bremen]] and [[Hamburg]]). On 1 July a currency union preceded the political union: the \"Ostmark\" was abolished, and the Western German \"Deutsche Mark\" became common currency.\n\nAlthough the Volkskammer's declaration of accession to the Federal Republic had initiated the process of reunification; the act of reunification itself (with its many specific terms, conditions and qualifications; some of which involved amendments to the West German Basic Law) was achieved constitutionally by the subsequent Unification Treaty of 31 August 1990; that is through a binding agreement between the former Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic now recognising each other as separate sovereign states in international law.<ref>{{citation|first=Donald P. |last=Kommers|title=The Constitutional Jursiprudence of the Federal Republic of Germany |date=2012 |publisher=Duke University Press|pages= 309}}</ref> This treaty was then voted into effect prior to the agreed date for Unification by both the Volkskammer and the [[Bundestag]] by the constitutionally required two-thirds majorities; effecting on the one hand, the extinction of the GDR, and on the other, the agreed amendments to the Basic Law of the Federal Republic.\n\nThe great economic and socio-political inequalities between the former Germanies required government subsidy for the full integration of the German Democratic Republic into the Federal Republic of Germany. Because of the resulting [[deindustrialization]] in the former East Germany, the causes of the failure of this integration continue to be debated. Some western commentators claim that the depressed eastern economy is a natural aftereffect of a demonstrably inefficient [[command economy]]. But many East German critics contend that the [[Shock therapy (economics)|shock-therapy]] style of [[privatization]], the artificially high [[rate of exchange]] offered for the [[East German mark|Ostmark]], and the speed with which the entire process was implemented did not leave room for East German enterprises to adapt.<ref>For example, the economist J\u00f6rg Roesler{{snd}}see: J\u00f6rg Roesler: Ein Anderes Deutschland war m\u00f6glich.

It was created in 1946 through the Soviet-directed merger of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) in the Soviet controlled zone. However, the SED quickly transformed into a full-fledged Communist party as the more independent-minded Social Democrats were pushed out.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Eric D.

As in other Soviet-bloc countries, [[Bloc party (politics)|non-communist political parties]] were allowed. Nevertheless, every political party in the GDR was forced to join the [[National Front (East Germany)|National Front of Democratic Germany]], a broad coalition of parties and mass political organisations, including:\n* ''Christlich-Demokratische Union Deutschlands'' ([[Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)|Christian Democratic Union of Germany]], CDU), which merged with the West German [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] after reunification.\n* ''Demokratische Bauernpartei Deutschlands'' ([[Democratic Farmers' Party of Germany]], DBD).

Verwaltungsbezirke farbig.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Districts of the German Democratic Republic in 1952]]\n{{Main|Administrative divisions of East Germany|List of leaders of administrative divisions of East Germany}}\n\nUntil 1952, East Germany comprised the capital, [[East Berlin]] (though legally it was not fully part of the GDR's territory), and the five [[States of Germany|German states]] of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] (in 1947 renamed Mecklenburg), [[Brandenburg]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], [[Thuringia]], and [[Saxony]], their post-war territorial demarcations approximating the pre-war German demarcations of the [[Middle Germany|Middle German]] ''L\u00e4nder'' (states) and ''Provinzen'' ([[provinces of Prussia]]). The western parts of two provinces, [[Pomerania Province (1815-1945)|Pomerania]] and [[Lower Silesia]], the remainder of which were annexed by Poland, remained in the GDR and were attached to Mecklenburg and Saxony, respectively.\n\nThe [[East German Administrative Reform of 1952]] established 14 ''Bezirke'' (districts) and ''de facto'' disestablished the five ''L\u00e4nder''. The new ''Bezirke'', named after their district centres, were as follows: (i) [[Rostock]], (ii) [[Neubrandenburg]], and (iii) [[Schwerin]] created from the ''Land'' (state) of Mecklenburg; (iv) [[Potsdam]], (v) [[Frankfurt (Oder)]], and (vii) [[Cottbus]] from Brandenburg; (vi) [[Magdeburg]] and (viii) [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] from Saxony-Anhalt; (ix) [[Leipzig]], (xi) [[Dresden]], and (xii) [[Karl-Marx-Stadt]] (Chemnitz until 1953 and again from 1990) from Saxony; and (x) [[Erfurt]], (xiii) [[Gera]], and (xiv) [[Suhl]] from Thuringia.\n\nEast Berlin was made the country's 15th ''Bezirk'' in 1961 but retained special legal status until 1968, when the residents approved the new (draft) constitution. Despite the city as a whole being legally under the control of the [[Allied Control Council]], and diplomatic objections of the Allied governments, the GDR administered the ''Bezirk'' of Berlin as part of its territory.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1982-0816-002, Leipzig, Karl-Marx-Platz, Brunnen.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|[[City-Hochhaus Leipzig|Uni-Riese]] (''University Giant'') in 1982. Built in 1972, it was once part of the [[University of Leipzig|Karl-Marx-University]] and is Leipzig's tallest building.]]\n\n== Military ==\n[[File:Nva-ehrenwache.jpg|thumb|right|upright|East German ''[[National People's Army|Nationale Volksarmee]]'' changing-of-the-guard ceremony in East Berlin]]\nThe government of East Germany had control over a large number of military and paramilitary organisations through various ministries. Chief among these was the Ministry of National Defence. Because of East Germany's proximity to the West during the [[Cold War]] (1945\u201392), its military forces were among the most advanced of the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Defining what was a military force and what was not is a matter of some dispute.\n\n=== National People's Army ===\n{{Main|National People's Army}}\nThe Nationale Volksarmee (NVA) was the largest military organisation in East Germany. It was formed in 1956 from the [[Kasernierte Volkspolizei]] (Barracked People's Police), the military units of the regular police ([[Volkspolizei]]), when East Germany joined the Warsaw Pact. From its creation, it was controlled by the [[Ministry of National Defence (East Germany)]]. It was an all volunteer force until an eighteen-month [[conscription]] period was introduced in 1962. {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\nIt was regarded by NATO officers as the best military in the Warsaw Pact.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/08/world/east-german-military-warsaw-pact-s-finest.html|title=East German Military: Warsaw Pact's Finest|first1=Bernard E.|last1=Trainor|date=8 November 1988|access-date=31 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801003742/https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/08/world/east-german-military-warsaw-pact-s-finest.html|archive-date=1 August 2018|url-status=live|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>\nThe NVA consisted of the following branches:\n* Army ''([[Landstreitkr\u00e4fte]])''\n* Navy ''([[Volksmarine]]''{{snd}}People's Navy)\n* Air Force ''([[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte der NVA|Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte/Luftverteidigung]])''\n\n=== Border troops ===\n{{Main|Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic}}\n\nThe border troops of the Eastern sector were originally organised as a police force, the Deutsche Grenzpolizei, similar to the [[Bundesgrenzschutz]] in West Germany. It was controlled by the Ministry of the Interior. Following the remilitarisation of East Germany in 1956, the Deutsche Grenzpolizei was transformed into a military force in 1961, modeled after the [[Soviet Border Troops]], and transferred to the Ministry of National Defense, as part of the National People's Army. In 1973, it was separated from the NVA, but it remained under the same ministry. At its peak, it numbered approximately 47,000 men.\n\n=== Volkspolizei ===\n{{Main|Bereitschaftspolizei#In the former German Democratic Republic}}\n\nAfter the NVA was separated from the Volkspolizei in 1956, the Ministry of the Interior maintained its own public order barracked reserve, known as the Volkspolizei-Bereitschaften (VPB). These units were, like the Kasernierte Volkspolizei, equipped as motorised infantry, and they numbered between 12,000 and 15,000 men.\n\n=== Stasi ===\n{{main|Stasi}}\nThe Ministry of State Security (Stasi) included the [[Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment]], which was mainly involved with facilities security and plain clothes events security. They were the only part of the feared Stasi that was visible to the public, and so were very unpopular within the population. The Stasi numbered around 90,000 men, the Guards Regiment around 11,000-12,000 men.\n\n=== Combat groups of the working class ===\nThe ''[[Kampfgruppen der Arbeiterklasse]]'' (combat groups of the working class) numbered around 400,000 for much of their existence, and were organised around factories. The KdA was the political-military instrument of the SED; it was essentially a \"party Army\". All KdA directives and decisions were made by the ZK's ''[[Politburo|Politb\u00fcro]]''. They received their training from the Volkspolizei and the Ministry of the Interior. Membership was voluntary, but SED members were required to join as part of their membership obligation.\n\n=== Conscientious objection ===\n{{Main|Conscientious objection in East Germany}}\n\nEvery man was required to serve eighteen months of [[conscription|compulsory military service]]; for the medically unqualified and [[conscientious objector]], there were the ''[[Baueinheiten]]'' (construction units), established in 1964, two years after the introduction of conscription, in response to political pressure by the national [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Protestant Church upon the GDR's government. In the 1970s, East German leaders acknowledged that former [[w:en:Construction soldier|construction soldiers]] were at a disadvantage when they rejoined the civilian sphere.\n\n==Foreign policy==\n=== United States as primary threat ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-48550-0036, Besuch Ho Chi Minhs bei Pionieren, bei Berlin.jpg|thumb|North Vietnamese leader [[Ho Chi Minh]] with East German [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann Pioneer Organisation|Young Pioneers]], 1957]]\n\nThe East German state promoted an \"[[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]]\" line that was reflected in all its media and all the schools.<ref>[[Mark Allinson]], ''Politics and Popular Opinion in East Germany 1945\u20131968'' (2000) ch 1</ref>  This line followed Lenin's theory of imperialism as the highest and last stage of capitalism, and [[Georgi Dimitrov|Dimitrov]]'s theory of fascism as the dictatorship of the most reactionary elements of [[finance capitalism|financial capitalism]]. Popular reaction to these measures was mixed, and Western media penetrated the country both through cross-border television and radio broadcasts from West Germany and from the U.S. propaganda network [[Radio Free Europe]]. Dissidents, particularly professionals, sometimes fled to West Germany, which was relatively easy before the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-vPuoKrNRp8C&pg=PA618 |last=Schnoor |first=Rainer |chapter=The Good and the Bad America: Perceptions of the United States in the GDR |pages=618\u201326 |title=The United States and Germany in the Era of the Cold War, 1945-1990: A Handbook |volume=1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas Adam|title=Germany and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History; a Multidisciplinary Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8uxfTF4Lm-kC&pg=PA1067 |year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=1067|isbn=9781851096282|access-date=14 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506042703/https://books.google.com/books?id=8uxfTF4Lm-kC&pg=PA1067|archive-date=6 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Support of Third World socialist countries ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-Z1014-018, Berlin, Staatsoberhaupt Angolas an der Grenze.jpg|thumb|right|Angola's [[Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos]] during his visit in East Berlin]]\n\nAfter receiving wider international diplomatic recognition in 1972\u201373, the GDR began active cooperation with Third World socialist governments and [[Wars of national liberation|national liberation movements]]. While the USSR was in control of the overall strategy and Cuban armed forces were involved in the actual combat (mostly in the [[People's Republic of Angola]] and socialist [[Derg|Ethiopia]]), the GDR provided experts for military hardware maintenance and personnel training, and oversaw creation of secret security agencies based on its own Stasi model.\n\nAlready in the 1960s contacts were established with Angola's [[MPLA]], Mozambique's [[FRELIMO]] and the [[PAIGC]] in Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde. In the 1970s official cooperation was established with other self-proclaimed socialist governments and people's republics: [[People's Republic of the Congo]], [[People's Democratic Republic of Yemen]], [[Somali Democratic Republic]], [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya]], and the [[People's Republic of Benin]].\n\nThe first military agreement was signed in 1973 with the People's Republic of the Congo. In 1979 friendship treaties were signed with Angola, Mozambique and Ethiopia.\n\nIt was estimated that altogether, 2000\u20134000 DDR military and security experts were dispatched to Africa. In addition, representatives from African and Arab countries and liberation movements underwent military training in the GDR.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rOoyp-1UOH4C&pg=PA184 |page=184 |title=Moscow's Third World Strategy |isbn=0691023328 |last1=Rubinstein |first1=Alvin Z. |date=16 July 1990 |access-date=26 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191201040239/https://books.google.com/books?id=rOoyp-1UOH4C&pg=PA184 |archive-date=1 December 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===East Germany and the Middle East conflict===\nEast Germany pursued an [[anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] policy; [[Jeffrey Herf]] argues that East Germany was waging an undeclared war on [[Israel]].<ref name=\"Herf\">{{cite book |last=Herf |first=Jeffrey |author-link=Jeffrey Herf|year=2016 |title=Undeclared Wars with Israel: East Germany and the West German Far Left, 1967\u20131989 |url= |location= |publisher= Cambridge University Press |page= |isbn= 9781107089860 }}</ref> According to Herf, \"the Middle East was one of the crucial battlefields of the global Cold War between the Soviet Union and the West; it was also a region in which East Germany played a salient role in the Soviet bloc\u2019s antagonism toward Israel.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Herf |first1=Jeffrey |author-link1=Jeffrey Herf|year=2014 |title='At War with Israel': East Germany's Key Role in Soviet Policy in the Middle East |url= |journal=[[Journal of Cold War Studies]] |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages= 129\u2013163 |doi=10.1162/JCWS_a_00450}}</ref> While East Germany saw itself as an \"anti-fascist state\", it regarded [[Israel]] as a \"fascist state\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Laqueur |first=Walter |year= 1968 |title= The Road to Jerusalem: The Origins of the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 1967 |url=https://archive.org/details/roadtojerusalemt00laqu|url-access=registration |location= |publisher=Macmillan |page= [https://archive.org/details/roadtojerusalemt00laqu/page/215 215] |isbn= 978-0025683600 |author-link=Walter Laqueur}}</ref> and East Germany strongly supported the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] in its armed struggle against Israel.

The [[Red Army]] dismantled and transported to Russia the infrastructure and industrial plants of the Soviet Zone of Occupation. By the early 1950s, the reparations were paid in agricultural and industrial products; and [[Lower Silesia]], with its coal mines and [[Szczecin]], an important natural port, were given to Poland by the decision of Stalin and in accordance with [[Potsdam Agreement]].<ref name=\"Norman M. Naimark 1949, pp. 167-9\"/>\n\nThe socialist [[centrally planned economy]] of the German Democratic Republic was like that of the USSR. In 1950, the GDR joined the [[COMECON]] trade bloc. In 1985, [[collective]] (state) enterprises earned 96.7% of the net national income. To ensure stable prices for goods and services, the state paid 80% of basic supply costs. The estimated 1984 per capita income was $9,800 ($22,600 in 2015 dollars). In 1976, the average annual growth of the GDP was approximately five percent. This made East German economy the richest in all of the [[Soviet Bloc]] until reunification in 1990.<ref name=\"Econ stats\">{{Cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1052/is_n4_v110/ai_7373809|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109185421/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1052/is_n4_v110/ai_7373809|url-status=dead|archive-date=9 November 2007|title=Business America.

East Germans with friends or relatives in the West (or with any access to a [[hard currency]]) and the necessary [[Staatsbank]] [[foreign currency account]] could afford Western products and export-quality East German products via [[Intershop]]. Consumer goods also were available, by post, from the Danish [[Jauerfood]], and Genex companies.\n\nThe government used money and prices as political devices, providing highly subsidised prices for a wide range of basic goods and services, in what was known as \"the second pay packet\".<ref>Boroch, Wilfried (1996), \"Social policy as an institutional transformation problem\", ''Transition Economies'', Volume 31, Number 3, pp. 139-146.</ref>  At the production level, artificial prices made for a system of semi-barter and resource hoarding. For the consumer, it led to the substitution of GDR money with time, barter, and hard currencies. The socialist economy became steadily more dependent on financial infusions from hard-currency loans from West Germany. East Germans, meanwhile, came to see their soft currency as worthless relative to the Deutsche Mark (DM).<ref>Jonathan R.

In 1961, the renowned philosophical theologian [[Paul Tillich]] claimed that the Protestant population in East Germany had the most admirable Church in Protestantism, because the Communists there had not been able to win a spiritual victory over them.<ref>Paul Tillich. Christianity and the Encounter of the World Religions (New York: Columbia University Press, 1963), p. 20.</ref> By 1989, membership in the Christian churches dropped significantly. Protestants constituted 25% of the population, Catholics 5%. The share of people who considered themselves non-religious rose from 5% in 1950 to 70% in 1989.\n\n===State atheism===\n{{Further|State atheism|Irreligion in Germany}}\n\nWhen it first came to power, the Communist party asserted the compatibility of Christianity and Marxism and sought Christian participation in the building of socialism. At first the promotion of [[Marxist-Leninist atheism]] received little official attention. In the mid-1950s, as the Cold War heated up, atheism became a topic of major interest for the state, in both domestic and foreign contexts. University chairs and departments devoted to the study of scientific atheism were founded and much literature (scholarly and popular) on the subject was produced.{{by whom|date=September 2015}} This activity subsided in the late 1960s amid perceptions that it had started to become counterproductive. Official and scholarly attention to atheism renewed beginning in 1973, though this time with more emphasis on scholarship and on the training of cadres than on propaganda. Throughout, the attention paid to atheism in East Germany was never intended to jeopardise the cooperation that was desired from those East Germans who were religious.<ref>Fulbrook, \"The Limits Of Totalitarianism: God, State and Society in the GDR\"</ref>\n\n=== Protestantism ===\n{{Main|de:Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR|l1=Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-W0613-039, Sitzung des Martin-Luther-Komitees.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|right|A 1980 meeting between representatives of the BEK and Erich Honecker]]\n\nEast Germany, historically, was majority [[Protestant]] (primarily [[Lutheran]]) from the early stages of the [[Protestant Reformation]] onwards. In 1948, freed from the influence of the [[Nazism|Nazi-oriented]] [[German Christians]], [[Lutheran]], [[Calvinism|Reformed]] and [[united and uniting churches|United churches]] from most parts of Germany came together as the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] (EKD) at the Conference of Eisenach (''Kirchenversammlung von Eisenach'').\n\nIn 1969 the regional Protestant churches in East Germany and [[East Berlin]]{{NoteTag|The Eastern churches were the [[Evangelical Church of Anhalt]], [[Evangelical Church in Berlin, Brandenburg and Silesian Upper Lusatia#Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg]] (EKiBB, East Ambit, for East Berlin and Brandenburg), [[Evangelical Church of Silesia|Evangelical Church of the G\u00f6rlitz Ecclesiastical Region]], [[Pomeranian Evangelical Church#Evangelical Church in Greifswald|Evangelical Church in Greifswald]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Mecklenburg]], [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Saxony]], [[Evangelical Church of the Church Province of Saxony]] (KPS), [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Thuringia]] and [[Evangelical Church of the Union]] (East Region, for EKiBB-East Ambit, G\u00f6rlitz, Greifswald and KPS, and since 1970 for Anhalt too).}} broke away from the EKD and formed the ''Federation of Protestant Churches in the German Democratic Republic'' ({{lang-de|link=no|[[:de:Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR|Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR]]}}, BEK), in 1970 also joined by the [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] ''Herrnhuter Br\u00fcdergemeine''. In June 1991, following the [[German reunification]], the BEK churches again merged with the EKD ones.\n\nBetween 1956 and 1971 the [[leadership]] of the East German Lutheran churches gradually changed its relations with the state from hostility to cooperation.<ref>Martin Onnasch, \"Konflikt und Kompromiss: Die Haltung der evangelischen Kirchen zu den gesellschaftlichen Ver\u00e4nderungen in der DDR am Anfang der f\u00fcnfziger Jahre,\" [\"Conflict and compromise: the position of the Protestant churches with regard to social changes in the GDR at the beginning of the 1950s\"], ''Kirchliche Zeitgeschichte / Halbjahresschrift f\u00fcr Theologie und Geschichtswisseschaft,'' 1990, Vol. 3 Issue 1, pp.&nbsp;152\u2013165.</ref> From the founding of the GDR in 1949, the Socialist Unity Party sought to weaken the influence of the church on the rising generation. The church adopted an attitude of confrontation and distance toward the state. Around 1956 this began to develop into a more neutral stance accommodating conditional loyalty. The government was no longer regarded as illegitimate; instead, the church leaders started viewing the authorities as installed by God and, therefore, deserving of obedience by Christians. But on matters where the state demanded something which the churches felt was not in accordance with the will of God, the churches reserved their right to say no. There were both structural and intentional causes behind this development. Structural causes included the hardening of Cold War tensions in Europe in the mid-1950s, which made it clear that the East German state was not temporary. The loss of church members also made it clear to the leaders of the church that they had to come into some kind of dialogue with the state. The intentions behind the change of attitude varied from a traditional liberal Lutheran acceptance of secular power to a positive attitude toward socialist ideas.<ref name=\"Stephen R. Bowers 1982, pp 73-86\">Stephen R.

In 1969 he helped found the ''Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR'' (BEK), where he negotiated with the government while at the same time working within the institutions of this Protestant body. He won the regional elections for the Brandenburg state assembly at the head of the SPD list in 1990. Stolpe remained in the Brandenburg government until he joined the federal government in 2002.\n\nApart from the Protestant state churches ({{lang-de|link=no|[[Landeskirche]]n}}) united in the EKD/BEK and the [[Catholic Church]] there was a number of smaller Protestant bodies, including Protestant Free Churches ({{lang-de|link=no|[[:de:Freikirche|Evangelische Freikirchen]]}}) united in the [[:de:Bund Evangelisch-Freikirchlicher Gemeinden in der DDR|Federation of the Free Protestant Churches in the German Democratic Republic]] and the [[:de:Bund Freier evangelischer Gemeinden in Deutschland|Federation of the Free Protestant Churches in Germany]], as well as [[:de:Evangelisch-Lutherische Freikirche|the Free Lutheran Church]], [[:de:Evangelisch-lutherische (altlutherische) Kirche|the Old Lutheran Church]] and [[:de:Kirchenbund Evangelisch-Reformierter Gemeinden in der DDR|Federation of the Reformed Churches in the German Democratic Republic]]. The [[Moravian Church]] also had its presence as the ''Herrnhuter Br\u00fcdergemeine''.

During the early postwar years, tensions were high. The Catholic Church as a whole (and particularly the bishops) resisted both the East German state and Marxist ideology. The state allowed the bishops to lodge protests, which they did on issues such as abortion.<ref name=\"Stephen R. Bowers 1982, pp 73-86\"/>\n\nAfter 1945 the Church did fairly well in integrating Catholic exiles from lands to the east (which mostly became part of Poland) and in adjusting its institutional structures to meet the needs of a church within an officially atheist society. This meant an increasingly hierarchical church structure, whereas in the area of religious education, press, and youth organisations, a system of temporary staff was developed, one that took into account the special situation of [[Caritas International|Caritas]], a Catholic charity organisation. By 1950, therefore, there existed a Catholic subsociety that was well adjusted to prevailing specific conditions and capable of maintaining Catholic identity.<ref>{{cite book|author= Bernd Schaefer|title= The East German State and the Catholic Church, 1945-1989|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=96QzpCRH2agC|year= 2010|publisher= Berghahn Books|isbn= 9781845458522|access-date= 14 October 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160603062014/https://books.google.com/books?id=96QzpCRH2agC|archive-date= 3 June 2016|url-status= live}} ch 1</ref>{{Page needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nWith a generational change in the episcopacy taking place in the early 1980s, the state hoped for better relations with the new bishops, but the new bishops instead began holding unauthorised mass meetings, promoting international ties in discussions with theologians abroad, and hosting ecumenical conferences. The new bishops became less politically oriented and more involved in pastoral care and attention to spiritual concerns.

However, Pence and Betts argue, the majority of East Germans over time increasingly regarded the state's ideals to be hollow, though there was also a substantial number of East Germans who regarded their culture as having a healthier, more authentic mentality than that of West Germany.<ref>Pence and Betts, ''Socialist modern: East German everyday culture and politics''. page 37 for Maaz, 58.</ref>\n\nGDR culture and politics were limited by the harsh [[Censorship in East Germany|censorship]].<ref name=\"ed\">{{cite web|url=http://www.blogs.hss.ed.ac.uk/whos-watching-who/tales-archive/secrets-of-east-german-censorship/|website=blogs.hss.ed.ac.uk|title=The Secret of East German Censorship \u2014 Who's Watching Who?|accessdate=15 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216091214/http://www.blogs.hss.ed.ac.uk/whos-watching-who/tales-archive/secrets-of-east-german-censorship/|archive-date=16 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-F0321-0204-001, Berlin, Volksb\u00fchne, Oktoberklub, Hartmut K\u00f6nig.jpg|thumb|The ''Oktoberklub'' in 1967]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-W0115-047, Berlin, Frank Sch\u00f6bel bei Autogrammstunde.jpg|thumb|Pop singer [[Frank Sch\u00f6bel]] (center) giving autographs in 1980]]\n\nThe [[Puhdys]] and [[Karat (band)|Karat]] were some of the most popular mainstream bands in East Germany.

There were approximately 3.6&nbsp;million telephones in usage (21.8 for every 100 inhabitants), and 16,476 [[Teletypewriter message|Telex]] stations. Both of these networks were run by the [[Deutsche Post der DDR]] (East German Post Office). East Germany was assigned telephone country code [[+37]]; in 1991, several months after reunification, East German telephone exchanges were incorporated into country code +49.\n\nAn unusual feature of the telephone network was that, in most cases, [[direct distance dialing]] for [[long-distance call]]s was not possible. Although [[area codes]] were assigned to all major towns and cities, they were only used for switching international calls. Instead, each location had its own list of dialing codes with shorter codes for [[local call]]s and longer codes for long-distance calls. After unification, the existing network was largely replaced, and area codes and dialing became standardised.\n\nIn 1976 East Germany inaugurated the operation of a ground-based radio station at [[F\u00fcrstenwalde]] for the purpose of relaying and receiving communications from Soviet satellites and to serve as a participant in the international telecommunications organization established by the Soviet government, [[Intersputnik]].\n\n== Official and public holidays ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The GDR dissolved itself, and Germany was [[German reunification|reunified]] on 3 October 1990, becoming a fully sovereign state in the Federal Republic of Germany. Several of the GDR's leaders, notably its last communist leader [[Egon Krenz]], were prosecuted after reunification for crimes committed during the Cold War.\n\nGeographically, the German Democratic Republic bordered the [[Baltic Sea]] to the north; [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] to the east; [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] to the southeast and [[West Germany]] to the southwest and west. Internally, the GDR also bordered the Soviet sector of [[History of Berlin#West and East Germany|Allied-occupied Berlin]], known as [[East Berlin]], which was also administered as the state's ''de facto'' capital. It also bordered the three sectors occupied by the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] known collectively as West Berlin. The three sectors occupied by the Western nations were sealed off from the GDR by the Berlin Wall from its construction in 1961 until it was brought down in 1989.\n\n==Naming conventions==\nThe official name was ''Deutsche Demokratische Republik'' (German Democratic Republic), usually abbreviated to ''DDR'' (GDR). Both terms were used in East Germany, with increasing usage of the abbreviated form, especially since East Germany considered West Germans and West Berliners to be foreigners following the promulgation of its [[Constitution of East Germany (1968)|second constitution]] in 1968. West Germans, the western media and statesmen initially avoided the official name and its abbreviation, instead using terms like ''Ostzone'' (Eastern Zone),<ref name=zeit49>{{cite news |author=Berlin Korrespondent|title=Nationale Front in der Ostzone|url=http://www.zeit.de/1949/22/nationale-front-in-der-ostzone |newspaper=[[Die Zeit]] |date = June 1949|access-date=10 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111023236/http://www.zeit.de/1949/22/nationale-front-in-der-ostzone|archive-date=11 November 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Sowjetische Besatzungszone'' (Soviet Occupation Zone; often abbreviated to ''SBZ''), and ''sogenannte DDR''<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45935352.html |title=Vom Sogenannten |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203124606/http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45935352.html |archivedate=3 February 2016 |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=21 October 1968 |page=65 |url-status=live }}</ref> (or \"so-called GDR\").<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9gQMAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA20 |title=Facts about Germany: The Federal Republic of Germany, 1959 - Germany (West) |page=20 |year=1959 |access-date=16 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221170436/https://books.google.com/books?id=9gQMAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA20 |archive-date=21 December 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe centre of political power in East Berlin was referred to as ''[[Pankow]]'' (the seat of command of the Soviet forces in East Germany was referred to as [[Karlshorst]]).<ref name=zeit49 /> Over time, however, the abbreviation ''DDR'' was also increasingly used colloquially by West Germans and West German media.{{NoteTag|The use of the abbreviation ''BRD'' (FRG) for West Germany, the ''Bundesrepublik Deutschland'' (''Federal Republic of Germany''), on the other hand, was never accepted in West Germany since it was considered a political statement. Thus ''BRD'' (FRG) was a term used by East Germans, or by West Germans who held a pro-East-German view. Colloquially, West Germans called West Germany simply \"Germany\" (reflecting West Germany's claim to represent the whole of Germany) or, alternatively, the ''Bundesrepublik'' or ''Bundesgebiet'' (federal republic, or federal territory, respectively), referring to the country, and ''Bundesb\u00fcrger'' (federal citizen[s]) for its citizens, with the adjective, ''bundesdeutsch'' (federal German).}}\n\nThe term ''Westdeutschland'' ([[West Germany]]), when used by West Germans, was almost always a reference to the geographic region of [[Western Germany]] and not to the area within the boundaries of the Federal Republic of Germany.

Ritter]] (2002) has argued that the East German state was defined by two dominant forces{{snd}}Soviet Communism on the one hand, and German traditions filtered through the interwar experiences of German Communists on the other. It always was constrained by the powerful example of the increasingly prosperous West, to which East Germans compared their nation. The changes wrought by the Communists were most apparent in ending capitalism and transforming industry and agriculture, in the militarization of society, and in the political thrust of the educational system and the media.

But many East German critics contend that the [[Shock therapy (economics)|shock-therapy]] style of [[privatization]], the artificially high [[rate of exchange]] offered for the [[East German mark|Ostmark]], and the speed with which the entire process was implemented did not leave room for East German enterprises to adapt.<ref>For example, the economist J\u00f6rg Roesler{{snd}}see: J\u00f6rg Roesler: Ein Anderes Deutschland war m\u00f6glich. Alternative Programme f\u00fcr das wirtschaftliche Zusammengehen beider deutscher Staaten, in: [[Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Forschungen zur Geschichte der Arbeiterbewegung]], No. II/2010, pp.34-46.

Conradt, ''The German Polity'' (2008) p. 20</ref> These included: 1949\u201361, which saw the building of socialism; 1961\u20131970 after the Berlin Wall closed off escape was a period of stability and consolidation; 1971\u201385 was termed the [[Honecker]] Era, and saw closer ties with West Germany; and 1985\u201389 saw the decline and extinction of East Germany.\n\n===Organization===\n{{Further|Constitution of East Germany}}\n\nThe ruling political party in East Germany was the ''Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands'' ([[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]], SED). It was created in 1946 through the Soviet-directed merger of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) in the Soviet controlled zone. However, the SED quickly transformed into a full-fledged Communist party as the more independent-minded Social Democrats were pushed out.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Eric D. Weitz, ''Creating German Communism, 1890\u20131990: From Popular Protests to Socialist State''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1997</ref>\n\nThe Potsdam Agreement committed the Soviets to supporting a democratic form of government in Germany, though the Soviets' understanding of democracy was radically different from that of the West. As in other Soviet-bloc countries, [[Bloc party (politics)|non-communist political parties]] were allowed. Nevertheless, every political party in the GDR was forced to join the [[National Front (East Germany)|National Front of Democratic Germany]], a broad coalition of parties and mass political organisations, including:\n* ''Christlich-Demokratische Union Deutschlands'' ([[Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)|Christian Democratic Union of Germany]], CDU), which merged with the West German [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] after reunification.\n* ''Demokratische Bauernpartei Deutschlands'' ([[Democratic Farmers' Party of Germany]], DBD). The party merged with the West German [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] after reunification.\n* ''Liberal-Demokratische Partei Deutschlands'' ([[Liberal Democratic Party of Germany]], LDPD), merged with the West German [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|FDP]] after reunification.\n* ''Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands'' ([[National Democratic Party of Germany (East Germany)|National Democratic Party of Germany]], NDPD), merged with the West German [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|FDP]] after reunification.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n[[File:Berlin, Palast der Republik -- um 1990 -- 2.jpg|thumb|The [[Palace of the Republic (Berlin)|Palast der Republik]], the seat of the [[Volkskammer]]]]\n[[File:Berlin DDR.jpg|thumb|Poster with the inscription \"Berlin - Hauptstadt der DDR\", 1967]]\n{{OSM Location map\n| coord = {{coord|22|02|00|N|81|24|00|W|}}\n|  zoom =   10\n| width =  217\n| height = 250\n| caption = [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann Island]] was gifted to East Germany in 1972 by Cuba as an act of fraternity, although the resulting status of the island is now unclear.<ref>{{cite web|website=Deutsche Welle (DW)|url=http://www.dw.com/en/castros-caribbean-island-gift-to-east-germany/a-36539460|title=Castro's Caribbean island gift to East Germany|date=27 November 2016|author=Nik Martin|access-date=22 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320053848/http://www.dw.com/en/castros-caribbean-island-gift-to-east-germany/a-36539460|archive-date=20 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n| minimap = file\n| mini-file = LocationCuba.svg\n| mini-width = 100\n| mini-height = 50\n| minipog-x = 56\n| minipog-y = 17\n| scalemark = 105\n| mark-coord =       {{coord|22.033333|-81.4}}\n|      label =       Ernst Th\u00e4lmann Island\n| label-color=       black\n|  label-pos =       top\n| mark-title =       Ernst Th\u00e4llman Island\n}}\n\nThe member parties were almost completely subservient to the SED, and had to accept its \"[[vanguard party|leading role]]\" as a condition of their existence. However, the parties did have representation in the Volkskammer and received some posts in the government.\n\nThe Volkskammer also included representatives from the ''[[mass movement|mass organisations]]'' like the [[Free German Youth]] (''Freie Deutsche Jugend'' or ''FDJ''), or the [[Free German Trade Union Federation]]. There was also a [[Democratic Women's Federation of Germany]], with seats in the Volkskammer.\n\nImportant non-parliamentary mass organisations in East German society included the German Gymnastics and Sports Association (''Deutscher Turn- und Sportbund'' or ''[[DTSB]]''), and [[People's Solidarity]] (''Volkssolidarit\u00e4t''), an organisation for the elderly. Another society of note was the [[Society for German-Soviet Friendship]].\n\nAfter the fall of Communism, the SED was renamed the \"[[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]]\" (PDS) which continued for a decade after reunification before merging with the West German [[Labour and Social Justice \u2013 The Electoral Alternative|WASG]] to form the [[Left Party (Germany)|Left Party]] (''Die Linke''). The Left Party continues to be a political force in many parts of Germany, albeit drastically less powerful than the SED.<ref>Mary Elise Sarotte, ''1989: The Struggle to Create Post-Cold War Europe'' (Second Edition) Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2014</ref>\n\n==Population==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1984-0807-017, Leipzig, Familienszene.jpg|thumb|right|A woman and her husband, both medical students, and their triplets in East Germany in 1984.

The new ''Bezirke'', named after their district centres, were as follows: (i) [[Rostock]], (ii) [[Neubrandenburg]], and (iii) [[Schwerin]] created from the ''Land'' (state) of Mecklenburg; (iv) [[Potsdam]], (v) [[Frankfurt (Oder)]], and (vii) [[Cottbus]] from Brandenburg; (vi) [[Magdeburg]] and (viii) [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] from Saxony-Anhalt; (ix) [[Leipzig]], (xi) [[Dresden]], and (xii) [[Karl-Marx-Stadt]] (Chemnitz until 1953 and again from 1990) from Saxony; and (x) [[Erfurt]], (xiii) [[Gera]], and (xiv) [[Suhl]] from Thuringia.\n\nEast Berlin was made the country's 15th ''Bezirk'' in 1961 but retained special legal status until 1968, when the residents approved the new (draft) constitution. Despite the city as a whole being legally under the control of the [[Allied Control Council]], and diplomatic objections of the Allied governments, the GDR administered the ''Bezirk'' of Berlin as part of its territory.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1982-0816-002, Leipzig, Karl-Marx-Platz, Brunnen.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|[[City-Hochhaus Leipzig|Uni-Riese]] (''University Giant'') in 1982.

Chief among these was the Ministry of National Defence. Because of East Germany's proximity to the West during the [[Cold War]] (1945\u201392), its military forces were among the most advanced of the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Defining what was a military force and what was not is a matter of some dispute.\n\n=== National People's Army ===\n{{Main|National People's Army}}\nThe Nationale Volksarmee (NVA) was the largest military organisation in East Germany. It was formed in 1956 from the [[Kasernierte Volkspolizei]] (Barracked People's Police), the military units of the regular police ([[Volkspolizei]]), when East Germany joined the Warsaw Pact. From its creation, it was controlled by the [[Ministry of National Defence (East Germany)]]. It was an all volunteer force until an eighteen-month [[conscription]] period was introduced in 1962. {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\nIt was regarded by NATO officers as the best military in the Warsaw Pact.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/08/world/east-german-military-warsaw-pact-s-finest.html|title=East German Military: Warsaw Pact's Finest|first1=Bernard E.|last1=Trainor|date=8 November 1988|access-date=31 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801003742/https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/08/world/east-german-military-warsaw-pact-s-finest.html|archive-date=1 August 2018|url-status=live|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>\nThe NVA consisted of the following branches:\n* Army ''([[Landstreitkr\u00e4fte]])''\n* Navy ''([[Volksmarine]]''{{snd}}People's Navy)\n* Air Force ''([[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte der NVA|Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte/Luftverteidigung]])''\n\n=== Border troops ===\n{{Main|Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic}}\n\nThe border troops of the Eastern sector were originally organised as a police force, the Deutsche Grenzpolizei, similar to the [[Bundesgrenzschutz]] in West Germany. It was controlled by the Ministry of the Interior. Following the remilitarisation of East Germany in 1956, the Deutsche Grenzpolizei was transformed into a military force in 1961, modeled after the [[Soviet Border Troops]], and transferred to the Ministry of National Defense, as part of the National People's Army. In 1973, it was separated from the NVA, but it remained under the same ministry. At its peak, it numbered approximately 47,000 men.\n\n=== Volkspolizei ===\n{{Main|Bereitschaftspolizei#In the former German Democratic Republic}}\n\nAfter the NVA was separated from the Volkspolizei in 1956, the Ministry of the Interior maintained its own public order barracked reserve, known as the Volkspolizei-Bereitschaften (VPB). These units were, like the Kasernierte Volkspolizei, equipped as motorised infantry, and they numbered between 12,000 and 15,000 men.\n\n=== Stasi ===\n{{main|Stasi}}\nThe Ministry of State Security (Stasi) included the [[Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment]], which was mainly involved with facilities security and plain clothes events security. They were the only part of the feared Stasi that was visible to the public, and so were very unpopular within the population. The Stasi numbered around 90,000 men, the Guards Regiment around 11,000-12,000 men.\n\n=== Combat groups of the working class ===\nThe ''[[Kampfgruppen der Arbeiterklasse]]'' (combat groups of the working class) numbered around 400,000 for much of their existence, and were organised around factories. The KdA was the political-military instrument of the SED; it was essentially a \"party Army\". All KdA directives and decisions were made by the ZK's ''[[Politburo|Politb\u00fcro]]''. They received their training from the Volkspolizei and the Ministry of the Interior. Membership was voluntary, but SED members were required to join as part of their membership obligation.\n\n=== Conscientious objection ===\n{{Main|Conscientious objection in East Germany}}\n\nEvery man was required to serve eighteen months of [[conscription|compulsory military service]]; for the medically unqualified and [[conscientious objector]], there were the ''[[Baueinheiten]]'' (construction units), established in 1964, two years after the introduction of conscription, in response to political pressure by the national [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Protestant Church upon the GDR's government. In the 1970s, East German leaders acknowledged that former [[w:en:Construction soldier|construction soldiers]] were at a disadvantage when they rejoined the civilian sphere.\n\n==Foreign policy==\n=== United States as primary threat ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-48550-0036, Besuch Ho Chi Minhs bei Pionieren, bei Berlin.jpg|thumb|North Vietnamese leader [[Ho Chi Minh]] with East German [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann Pioneer Organisation|Young Pioneers]], 1957]]\n\nThe East German state promoted an \"[[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]]\" line that was reflected in all its media and all the schools.<ref>[[Mark Allinson]], ''Politics and Popular Opinion in East Germany 1945\u20131968'' (2000) ch 1</ref>  This line followed Lenin's theory of imperialism as the highest and last stage of capitalism, and [[Georgi Dimitrov|Dimitrov]]'s theory of fascism as the dictatorship of the most reactionary elements of [[finance capitalism|financial capitalism]]. Popular reaction to these measures was mixed, and Western media penetrated the country both through cross-border television and radio broadcasts from West Germany and from the U.S. propaganda network [[Radio Free Europe]]. Dissidents, particularly professionals, sometimes fled to West Germany, which was relatively easy before the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-vPuoKrNRp8C&pg=PA618 |last=Schnoor |first=Rainer |chapter=The Good and the Bad America: Perceptions of the United States in the GDR |pages=618\u201326 |title=The United States and Germany in the Era of the Cold War, 1945-1990: A Handbook |volume=1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas Adam|title=Germany and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History; a Multidisciplinary Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8uxfTF4Lm-kC&pg=PA1067 |year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=1067|isbn=9781851096282|access-date=14 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506042703/https://books.google.com/books?id=8uxfTF4Lm-kC&pg=PA1067|archive-date=6 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Support of Third World socialist countries ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-Z1014-018, Berlin, Staatsoberhaupt Angolas an der Grenze.jpg|thumb|right|Angola's [[Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos]] during his visit in East Berlin]]\n\nAfter receiving wider international diplomatic recognition in 1972\u201373, the GDR began active cooperation with Third World socialist governments and [[Wars of national liberation|national liberation movements]]. While the USSR was in control of the overall strategy and Cuban armed forces were involved in the actual combat (mostly in the [[People's Republic of Angola]] and socialist [[Derg|Ethiopia]]), the GDR provided experts for military hardware maintenance and personnel training, and oversaw creation of secret security agencies based on its own Stasi model.\n\nAlready in the 1960s contacts were established with Angola's [[MPLA]], Mozambique's [[FRELIMO]] and the [[PAIGC]] in Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde. In the 1970s official cooperation was established with other self-proclaimed socialist governments and people's republics: [[People's Republic of the Congo]], [[People's Democratic Republic of Yemen]], [[Somali Democratic Republic]], [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya]], and the [[People's Republic of Benin]].\n\nThe first military agreement was signed in 1973 with the People's Republic of the Congo. In 1979 friendship treaties were signed with Angola, Mozambique and Ethiopia.\n\nIt was estimated that altogether, 2000\u20134000 DDR military and security experts were dispatched to Africa.

The [[Red Army]] dismantled and transported to Russia the infrastructure and industrial plants of the Soviet Zone of Occupation. By the early 1950s, the reparations were paid in agricultural and industrial products; and [[Lower Silesia]], with its coal mines and [[Szczecin]], an important natural port, were given to Poland by the decision of Stalin and in accordance with [[Potsdam Agreement]].<ref name=\"Norman M. Naimark 1949, pp. 167-9\"/>\n\nThe socialist [[centrally planned economy]] of the German Democratic Republic was like that of the USSR. In 1950, the GDR joined the [[COMECON]] trade bloc. In 1985, [[collective]] (state) enterprises earned 96.7% of the net national income. To ensure stable prices for goods and services, the state paid 80% of basic supply costs. The estimated 1984 per capita income was $9,800 ($22,600 in 2015 dollars). In 1976, the average annual growth of the GDP was approximately five percent.

East Germans with friends or relatives in the West (or with any access to a [[hard currency]]) and the necessary [[Staatsbank]] [[foreign currency account]] could afford Western products and export-quality East German products via [[Intershop]]. Consumer goods also were available, by post, from the Danish [[Jauerfood]], and Genex companies.\n\nThe government used money and prices as political devices, providing highly subsidised prices for a wide range of basic goods and services, in what was known as \"the second pay packet\".<ref>Boroch, Wilfried (1996), \"Social policy as an institutional transformation problem\", ''Transition Economies'', Volume 31, Number 3, pp. 139-146.</ref>  At the production level, artificial prices made for a system of semi-barter and resource hoarding. For the consumer, it led to the substitution of GDR money with time, barter, and hard currencies. The socialist economy became steadily more dependent on financial infusions from hard-currency loans from West Germany.

Official and scholarly attention to atheism renewed beginning in 1973, though this time with more emphasis on scholarship and on the training of cadres than on propaganda.

The church adopted an attitude of confrontation and distance toward the state. Around 1956 this began to develop into a more neutral stance accommodating conditional loyalty. The government was no longer regarded as illegitimate; instead, the church leaders started viewing the authorities as installed by God and, therefore, deserving of obedience by Christians. But on matters where the state demanded something which the churches felt was not in accordance with the will of God, the churches reserved their right to say no. There were both structural and intentional causes behind this development. Structural causes included the hardening of Cold War tensions in Europe in the mid-1950s, which made it clear that the East German state was not temporary. The loss of church members also made it clear to the leaders of the church that they had to come into some kind of dialogue with the state. The intentions behind the change of attitude varied from a traditional liberal Lutheran acceptance of secular power to a positive attitude toward socialist ideas.<ref name=\"Stephen R.

In 1969 he helped found the ''Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR'' (BEK), where he negotiated with the government while at the same time working within the institutions of this Protestant body. He won the regional elections for the Brandenburg state assembly at the head of the SPD list in 1990. Stolpe remained in the Brandenburg government until he joined the federal government in 2002.\n\nApart from the Protestant state churches ({{lang-de|link=no|[[Landeskirche]]n}}) united in the EKD/BEK and the [[Catholic Church]] there was a number of smaller Protestant bodies, including Protestant Free Churches ({{lang-de|link=no|[[:de:Freikirche|Evangelische Freikirchen]]}}) united in the [[:de:Bund Evangelisch-Freikirchlicher Gemeinden in der DDR|Federation of the Free Protestant Churches in the German Democratic Republic]] and the [[:de:Bund Freier evangelischer Gemeinden in Deutschland|Federation of the Free Protestant Churches in Germany]], as well as [[:de:Evangelisch-Lutherische Freikirche|the Free Lutheran Church]], [[:de:Evangelisch-lutherische (altlutherische) Kirche|the Old Lutheran Church]] and [[:de:Kirchenbund Evangelisch-Reformierter Gemeinden in der DDR|Federation of the Reformed Churches in the German Democratic Republic]].

During the early postwar years, tensions were high. The Catholic Church as a whole (and particularly the bishops) resisted both the East German state and Marxist ideology. The state allowed the bishops to lodge protests, which they did on issues such as abortion.<ref name=\"Stephen R.

This meant an increasingly hierarchical church structure, whereas in the area of religious education, press, and youth organisations, a system of temporary staff was developed, one that took into account the special situation of [[Caritas International|Caritas]], a Catholic charity organisation.

There were approximately 3.6&nbsp;million telephones in usage (21.8 for every 100 inhabitants), and 16,476 [[Teletypewriter message|Telex]] stations. Both of these networks were run by the [[Deutsche Post der DDR]] (East German Post Office). East Germany was assigned telephone country code [[+37]]; in 1991, several months after reunification, East German telephone exchanges were incorporated into country code +49.\n\nAn unusual feature of the telephone network was that, in most cases, [[direct distance dialing]] for [[long-distance call]]s was not possible. Although [[area codes]] were assigned to all major towns and cities, they were only used for switching international calls. Instead, each location had its own list of dialing codes with shorter codes for [[local call]]s and longer codes for long-distance calls. After unification, the existing network was largely replaced, and area codes and dialing became standardised.\n\nIn 1976 East Germany inaugurated the operation of a ground-based radio station at [[F\u00fcrstenwalde]] for the purpose of relaying and receiving communications from Soviet satellites and to serve as a participant in the international telecommunications organization established by the Soviet government, [[Intersputnik]].\n\n== Official and public holidays ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In colonial French and [[British North America]], Indigenous women's roles were often challenged by missionaries, and their marriages to European fur traders often brought their communities into the fur trade. Throughout the colonial period, European women were encouraged to immigrate to Canadian colonies and expand the settler population. After [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1867 women's experiences were shaped by federal laws and by legislation passed in Canada's provincial legislatures. Women have been a key part of Canada's labour market, social movements, and culture for centuries, and yet have faced systematic discrimination. Women were given the federal franchise in 1918, served in both the [[World War I|First World War]] and the [[World War II|Second World War]], and participated in the [[Second-wave feminism|second-wave feminist movement]] from the 1960s onwards. Historians have been researching and writing about women's history in Canada in increasing numbers since the 1970s.<ref>{{cite book|title=Rethinking Canada: The Promise of Women's History|date=2016|publisher=Oxford UNiversity Press|isbn=978-0-1990-1108-7|editor-last1=Campbell|editor-first1=Lara|edition=seventh|editor-last2=Myers|editor-first2=Tamara|editor-last3=Perry|editor-first3=Adele}}</ref>\n\n==Quebec==\n[[File:The Arrival of the French Girls at Quebec, 1667 - C.W.

The orders specialized in charitable works, including hospitals, orphanages, [[maternity home|homes for unwed mothers]], and schools. In the first half of the twentieth century, about 2-3% of Quebec's young women became nuns; there were 6600 in 1901, and 26,000 in 1941. In Quebec in 1917, 32 different teaching orders operated 586 boarding schools for girls. At that time there was no public education for girls in Quebec beyond elementary school. Hospitals were another specially, the first of which was founded in 1701.

Indeed, most human rights activists did not raise the issue before the 1970s, because they were family oriented and subscribed to the deeply embedded ideology of the family wage, whereby the husband should be paid enough so the wife could be a full-time housewife. After lobbying by women, labor unions, and the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF), the Conservative government passed the Female Employees Fair Remuneration Act in 1951. It required equal pay for women who did the same work as men. Feminists in the 1950s and 1960s were unsuccessful in calling for a law that would prohibit other forms of sex discrimination, such as discrimination in hiring and promotion.

At first there were many single men on the prairie, or husbands whose wives were still back east, but they had a hard time. They realized the need for a wife. As the population increased rapidly, wives played a central role in settlement of the prairie region. Their labor, skills, and ability to adapt to the harsh environment proved decisive in meeting the challenges. They prepared bannock, beans and bacon, mended clothes, raised children, cleaned, tended the garden, helped at harvest time and nursed everyone back to health.

Accusing the AAGN of ignoring the medical needs of rural Alberta women, the leaders of the UFWA worked to improve economic and living conditions of women farmers. [[Irene Parlby]], the UFWA's first president, lobbied for the establishment of a provincial Department of Public Health, government-provided hospitals and doctors, and passage of a law to permit nurses to qualify as registered midwives. The AAGN leadership opposed midwife certification, arguing that nursing curricula left no room for midwife study, and thus nurses were not qualified to participate in home births. In 1919 the AAGN compromised with the UFWA, and they worked together for the passage of the Public Health Nurses Act that allowed nurses to serve as midwives in regions without doctors. Thus, Alberta's District Nursing Service, created in 1919 to coordinate the province's women's health resources, resulted chiefly from the organized, persistent political activism of UFWA members and only minimally from the actions of professional nursing groups clearly uninterested in rural Canadians' medical needs.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Sharon |last=Richardson |title=Political Women, Professional Nurses, and the Creation of Alberta's District Nursing Service, 1919-1925 |journal=Nursing History Review |date=1998 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=25\u201350 |pmid=9357295|doi=10.1891/1062-8061.6.1.25 }}</ref>\n\nThe Alberta District Nursing Service administered health care in the predominantly rural and impoverished areas of Alberta in the first half of the 20th century.

Nurses provided prenatal care, worked as midwives, performed minor surgery, conducted medical inspections of schoolchildren, and sponsored immunization programs. The post-Second World War discovery of large oil and gas reserves resulted in economic prosperity and the expansion of local medical services.

They were called \"Nursing Sisters\" and had already been professionally trained in civilian life. However, in military service they achieved an elite status well above what they had experienced as civilians. The Nursing Sisters had much more responsibility and autonomy, and had more opportunity to use their expertise, than civilian nurses. They were often close to the front lines, and the military doctors \u2013 mostly men \u2013 delegated significant responsibility to the nurses because of the high level of casualties, the shortages of physicians, and extreme working conditions.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Cynthia |last=Toman |title=Front Lines and Frontiers: War as Legitimate Work for Nurses, 1939-1945 |journal=Social History |date=2007 |volume=40 |issue=79 |pp=45\u201374|url=https://hssh.journals.yorku.ca/index.php/hssh/article/download/37038/33626}}<br>&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp;{{cite book|last=Toman|first=Cynthia|title=An Officer and a Lady: Canadian Military Nursing and the Second World War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mFAQlfWkk08C&pg=PP1|year=2007|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5816-8}}</ref>\n\n==Upper classes in 19th century==\n[[Image:Countess of Aberdeen in Queen's U robes Topley.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Victorian Order of Nurses]] founder [[Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair|Lady Aberdeen]] was the first woman to receive an [[honorary degree]] in Canada.<ref name=\"DownieRobertson2010\">{{cite book|last1=Downie|first1=Mary Alice|last2=Robertson|first2=Barbara|last3=Errington|first3=Elizabeth Jane|title=Early Voices: Portraits of Canada by Women Writers, 1639-1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JYrOqFoELBQC&pg=PA153|year=2010|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=978-1-55488-769-9|page=153}}</ref>]]\nThe upper classes of Canada, apart from some Quebec French families were largely of British origin. Military and government officials and their families came to British North America from England or Scotland; some arrived from Ulster. Most business interests were controlled by men of British stock.  [[French-Canadians]] remained largely culturally isolated from English-speaking Canadians (a situation later described in ''[[Two Solitudes (novel)|Two Solitudes]]'' by [[Hugh MacLennan]]).\n\nEnglish-speaking Canadian writers became popular, especially [[Catharine Parr Traill]] and her sister [[Susanna Moodie]], middle-class English settlers who published memoirs of their demanding lives as pioneers.  Traill published ''The Backwoods of Canada'' (1836) and ''[[Canadian Crusoes]]'' (1852), and Moodie published ''[[Roughing it in the Bush]]'' (1852) and ''Life in the Clearings'' (1853).

Books, magazines, popular music, and theatre productions were all imported to meet women's consumer demand.\n\nUpper-class women supported philanthropic causes similar to the educational and nursing charities championed by upper-class women in England. The [[Victorian Order of Nurses]], still in existence, was founded in 1897 as a gift to [[Queen Victoria]] to commemorate her [[Diamond Jubilee]]. The [[Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire]], founded in 1900, supports educational bursaries and book awards to promote [[Canadian patriotism]], but also to support knowledge of the [[British Empire]]. One of the patrons of [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]]'s  Victoria School of Art and Design (founded in 1887 and later named the [[Nova Scotia College of Art and Design]]) was [[Anna Leonowens]]. Women began making headway in their struggle to gain access to higher education: in 1875, the first woman university graduate in Canada was [[Grace Annie Lockhart]] ([[Mount Allison University]]). In 1880, [[Emily Stowe]] became the first woman licensed to practise medicine in Canada.\n\n==Women's clubs==\n[[File:Social.

It started a chapter in Ontario in 1874 and became a national union in 1885; it reached 16,000 members across Canada in 1914. The central demand was for prohibition, a provincial law that was designed to minimize the power of the liquor interests, reduce violence among men, reduce violence towards wives and children, and keep more money in the family. The leadership in most numbers came from evangelical Protestant churches, especially the Methodists and Baptists. Episcopalians seldom joined, and Catholics almost never. They held the plurality should be under the control of the churches, not under the control of private societies or the government.  The  WCTU took the lead in demanding votes for women, Its argument was based on a [[maternal feminist]] position to the effect that women possessed superior moral standards, especially regarding issues affecting the home and family life, and needed the votes to guarantee that the government supported proper public morals.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Sharon Anne |last=Cook |title='Sowing Seed for the Master': The Ontario WCTU |journal=Journal of Canadian Studies |date=1995 |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=175\u2013194 |doi=10.3138/jcs.30.3.175}}<br>&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp;{{cite book|last=Cook|first=Sharon Anne|title=Through Sunshine and Shadow: The Woman's Christian Temperance Union, Evangelicalism, and Reform in Ontario, 1874-1930|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IIrIH7VZhk4C&pg=PP1|year=1995|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |isbn=978-0-7735-1305-1}}</ref>\n\nStarting in the late 1870s the Ontario WCTU demanded that the schools to teach \"scientific temperance,\" which reinforced moralistic temperance messages with the study of anatomy and hygiene, taught as a compulsory subject in schools. Although initially successful in convincing the Ontario Department of Education to adopt scientific temperance as part of the curriculum, teachers opposed the plan and refused to implement it. The WCTU then moved to dry up the province through government action. They started with \"local option\" laws, which allowed local governments to prohibit the sale of liquor. Many towns and rural areas went dry in the years before 1914, but not the larger cities.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Sharon Anne |last=Cook |title='Earnest Christian Women, Bent on Saving our Canadian Youth': The Ontario Woman's Christian Temperance Union and Scientific Temperance Instruction, 1881-1930 |journal=Ontario History |date=1994 |volume=86 |issue=3 |pp=249\u2013267}}</ref>\n\nThe WCTU was always committed to prohibition and suffrage, but it had alternative priorities as well.

Members traveled to London, England, in 1929 to make the case for recognizing women as full legal citizens. In the 1930s the group addressed many of the controversial political issues of the day, including the introduction of a minimum wage, fair unemployment insurance legislation, the compulsory medical examination of school children, and the requirement of a medical certificate for marriage. The national convention of the BPW was held in Calgary in 1935. The club actively supported Canadian overseas forces in the Second World War.

They were the family financiers and encouraged other wives who otherwise might have coaxed their menfolk to accept company terms.  Women's labor leagues organized a variety of social, educational, and fund-raising functions. Women also violently confronted \"scabs\", policemen, and soldiers.

Women's legal rights made slow progress throughout the 19th century. In 1859, [[Upper Canada]] passed a law allowing married women to own property. In 1885, Alberta passed a law allowing unmarried women who owned property gained the right to vote and hold office in school matters.  This early activism was focused on increasing women\u2019s role in public life, with goals including women\u2019s suffrage, increased property rights, increased access to education, and recognition as \"persons\" under the law.<ref name=Prentice1988/> This early iteration of Canadian feminism was largely based in maternal feminism; the idea that women are natural caregivers and \"mothers of the nation\" who should participate in public life because of their perceived propensity for decisions that will result in good care of society. In this view, women were seen to be a civilizing force on society \u2013 which was a significant part of women\u2019s engagement in missionary work and in the [[Woman\u2019s Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU).<ref>{{cite book |editor-last1=Newman |editor-first1=Jacquetta A. |editor-last2=White|editor-first2=Linda Ann |title=Women, Politics, and Public Policy: The Political Struggles of Canadian Women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oTIqAAAAYAAJ&pg=PP1 |year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-541805-7}}</ref>\n\nReligion was an important factor in the early stages of the Canadian women\u2019s movement. Some of the earliest groups of organized women came together for a religious purpose.  When women were rejected as missionaries by their Churches and missionary societies, they started their own missionary societies and raised funds to send female missionaries abroad. Some of them raised enough to train some of their missionaries as teachers or doctors.<ref name=Prentice1988/>\n\nWoman's political status without the vote was vigorously promoted by the [[National Council of Women of Canada]] from 1894 to 1918. It promoted a vision of \"transcendent citizenship\" for women. The ballot was not needed, for citizenship was to be exercised through personal influence and moral suasion, through the election of men with strong moral character, and through raising public-spirited sons. The National Council position was integrated into its nation-building program that sought to uphold Canada as a White settler nation. While the woman suffrage movement was important for extending the political rights of White women, it was also authorized through race-based arguments that linked White women's enfranchisement to the need to protect the nation from \"racial degeneration.\"<ref>{{cite journal |first=Anne-Marie |last=Kinahan |title=Transcendent Citizenship: Suffrage, the National Council of Women of Canada, and the Politics of Organized Womanhood |journal=Journal of Canadian Studies |date=2008 |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=5\u201327 |doi=10.3138/jcs.42.3.5 |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/367036 |url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\nWomen sometimes did have a local vote in some provinces, as in Ontario from 1850, where women who owned property could vote for school trustees.

Most women served in Canada but some served overseas, most in roles such as secretaries, mechanics, cooks and so on. The CWAC was finally abolished as a separate corps in 1964 when women were fully integrated into the Canadian armed forces.\n\nWomen's military involvement paved the way for women\u2019s future involvement in combative roles. With tens of thousands of women involved in these organizations, it provided Canadian women with the opportunity to do their part in a global conflict.

There were regional differences as well, with the eastern provinces emphasizing a more feminine \"girls rule\" game of basketball, while the Western provinces preferred identical rules.  Girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sport has traditionally been slowed down by a series of factors: girls and women historically have low levels of interest and participation; there were very few women in leadership positions in academic administration, student affairs or athletics; there were few women coaches; the media strongly emphasized men's sports as a demonstration of masculinity, suggesting that women seriously interested in sports were crossing gender lines; the male sports establishment was actively hostile. Staunch feminists dismissed sports as unworthy of their support. Women's progress was uphill; they first had to counter the widespread notion that women's bodies were so restricted and delicate that vigorous physical activity was dangerous. These notions where first challenged by the \"new woman\" around 1900. These women started with bicycling; they rode into new gender spaces in education, work, and suffrage.<ref name=Hall2002>{{cite book|last=Hall|first=M.

The Women's Amateur Federation of Canada (WAAF) was formed in 1926 to make possible new opportunities, particularly in international competition. The WAAF worked to rebut the stereotype that vigorous physical activity and intense competition was \"unwomanly\". One tactic was to set up a system of medical supervision for all women athletes. The WAAF forged an alliance with supportive men who dominated the Amateur Athletic Union of Canada; this allowed women to compete in the Olympics and the British Empire Games.\n\nMany barriers fell in the 1920s: the Edmonton Grads became the world champions of women's basketball; the first Canadian women participated in the Olympics; and women sportswriters such as Phyllis Griffiths were hired to cover their feats on the sports pages.\n\nThe 1930s brought setbacks, as critics recommended  non-competitive athletic  activities as the recreation most suited to women. During the 1930s, a team of women from the small town of Preston, Ontario, overcame the difficulty of obtaining adequate ice time for practice, and the challenge of raising adequate funds from their small fan base. The Rivulettes  dominated women's ice hockey, winning ten provincial championships and four of the six Dominion championships.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Carly |last=Adams |title='Queens of the Ice Lanes': The Preston Rivulettes and Women's Hockey in Canada, 1931-1940 |journal=Sport History Review |date=May 2008 |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201329 |doi=10.1123/shr.39.1.1 |url=https://www.uleth.ca/dspace/bitstream/handle/10133/2550/queens%20of%20the%20ice.pdf}}</ref>  With money short during the Great Depression; after 1939 the hyper-masculinity of the Second World War blocked women's opportunities.

The feminists of the 1970s rarely helped promote women's breakthroughs in sports. Nevertheless, more and more women engaged in aerobics and organized sport. Figure skater [[Barbara Ann Scott]] was the outstanding female athlete of the 1940s, as the 1948 Olympic champion, a two-time World champion (1947\u20131948), and a four-time Canadian national champion (1944\u201346, 48) in ladies' singles.

The Fitness and Amateur Sport Act of 1961 (Bill C-131) and the report of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women in 1970 marked major advances. Perhaps the most critical development came in 1974, when Marion Lay and the federal government\u2019s Fitness and Amateur Sport Branch (FASB) sponsored a National Conference on Women and Sport.  it brought together coaches, academic administrators, and athletes to talk over the issues raised by the Royal Commission, and to chart a way forward.  Even so, there was no way to monitor the process and implement the recommendations. The 1980s accelerated the movement forward. The Sport Canada\u2019s Women\u2019s Program in 1980; the Female Athlete Conference in 1981; the Women in Sport program in 1981; and the Constitution Act of 1982. In 1981 Abby Hoffman, a former Olympian, was named director general of Sport Canada. Its  \"Policy on Women's Sport\" called for equality. The AAU of Canada now became more supportive. Court cases nail down the women's right to participate. In the provinces, human rights commissions addressed dozens of sport-related equity cases for women. Gender barriers in sports became a political topic, as shown by the Minister\u2019s Task Force Report in 1992 and the landmark decision of the Canadian Sport Council to include gender equity quotas in their operating principles.  By the 1990s women proved eager to enter formerly all-male sports such as ice hockey, rugby, and wrestling.  Their activism and their prowess on the playing field eroded old stereotypes and opened up new social roles for the woman athlete on campus and in her community. New problems emerged for sportswomen trying to achieve equal status with sportsmen: raising money, attracting popular audiences, and winning sponsors.<ref name=Hall2002/>\n\nHarrigan, (2003) reviews the emergence of women's athletics in higher education during 1961\u20132001. The establishment of the National Fitness and Amateur Sport Advisory Council helped women's intercollegiate sports to gain momentum. simultaneously there was a rise in the proportion of women in the student bodies, which enhanced the visibility of their sports. To overcome institutional inertia, women concentrated on organizing their sports and raising the consciousness of both male and female students. In 1969, the Canadian Women's Intercollegiate Athletic Union was formed to oversee events and sanction national championships; it merged with the Canadian Intercollegiate Athletic Union in 1978. Women increasingly became more active after 1980.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Patrick J. |last=Harrigan |title=Women's Agency and the Development of Women's Intercollegiate Athletics, 1961-2001 |journal=Historical Studies in Education |date=Spring 2003 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=37\u201376 |url=http://historicalstudiesineducation.ca/index.php/edu_hse-rhe/article/view/474/651}}</ref>\n\n==Violence against women==\nAttention to [[violence against women]] in Canada started to gain prominence in the 1980s.

These dealt principally with pimping, procuring, operating brothels and soliciting. Most amendments to date have dealt with the latter, originally classified as a vagrancy offence, this was amended to soliciting in 1972, and communicating in 1985. Since the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] became law in 1982, the constitutionality of Canada's prostitution laws have been challenged on a number of occasions.\n\nUp to the 1880s prostitution was tolerated in The Prairie provinces. Before 1909 there were few arrests and even fewer fines for prostitution, in part because those caught were encouraged to leave town rather than be jailed. As the population became more settled, however, public opinion regarding this resource for itinerant men turned hostile.   For example, a smallpox epidemic in the red light districts of Calgary ignited a crackdown as demanded by middle-class women reformers. Local chapters of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] vigorously opposed both saloons and prostitution, and called for woman suffrage as a tool to end those evils.<ref name=Sheehan1981/><ref>{{cite journal |first=Judy |last=Bedford |title=Prostitution In Calgary 1905-1914 |journal=Alberta History |date=1981 |volume=29|issue=2|pp=1\u201311 |url=http://peel.library.ualberta.ca/bibliography/9021.29.2/3.html}}</ref>\n\n==Historiography and recognition==\n[[File:Louise McKinney 1.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Louise McKinney]] in Calgary, Alberta.

In colonial French and [[British North America]], Indigenous women's roles were often challenged by missionaries, and their marriages to European fur traders often brought their communities into the fur trade. Throughout the colonial period, European women were encouraged to immigrate to Canadian colonies and expand the settler population. After [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1867 women's experiences were shaped by federal laws and by legislation passed in Canada's provincial legislatures. Women have been a key part of Canada's labour market, social movements, and culture for centuries, and yet have faced systematic discrimination. Women were given the federal franchise in 1918, served in both the [[World War I|First World War]] and the [[World War II|Second World War]], and participated in the [[Second-wave feminism|second-wave feminist movement]] from the 1960s onwards. Historians have been researching and writing about women's history in Canada in increasing numbers since the 1970s.<ref>{{cite book|title=Rethinking Canada: The Promise of Women's History|date=2016|publisher=Oxford UNiversity Press|isbn=978-0-1990-1108-7|editor-last1=Campbell|editor-first1=Lara|edition=seventh|editor-last2=Myers|editor-first2=Tamara|editor-last3=Perry|editor-first3=Adele}}</ref>\n\n==Quebec==\n[[File:The Arrival of the French Girls at Quebec, 1667 - C.W.

The orders specialized in charitable works, including hospitals, orphanages, [[maternity home|homes for unwed mothers]], and schools. In the first half of the twentieth century, about 2-3% of Quebec's young women became nuns; there were 6600 in 1901, and 26,000 in 1941. In Quebec in 1917, 32 different teaching orders operated 586 boarding schools for girls. At that time there was no public education for girls in Quebec beyond elementary school. Hospitals were another specially, the first of which was founded in 1701. In 1936, the nuns of Quebec operated 150 institutions, with 30,000 beds to care for the long-term sick, the homeless, and orphans.<ref name=Dumont>{{cite book |last=Dumont |first=Micheline |display-authors=etal |title=Quebec Women: A History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=50UqAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA94 |year=1987 |publisher=Women's Press |isbn=978-0-88961-101-6 |pages=94\u201396, 218\u201320, 241}}</ref>  On a smaller scale, Catholic orders of  nuns operated similar institutions in other provinces.\n\nThe [[Quiet Revolution]] of the 1960s combined declericalization with the dramatic reforms of [[Vatican II]]. There was a dramatic change in the role of nuns.  Many left the convent while very few young women entered.  The provincial government took over the nuns' traditional role as provider of many of Quebec's educational and social services. Often ex-nuns continued the same roles in civilian dress, but also men for the first time started entering the teaching profession.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Micheline |last=D'Allaire |title=Les Religieuses du Qu\u00e9bec dans le Courant de la La\u00efcisation |language=French |journal=Cultures du Canada Fran\u00e7ais |date=1986 |volume=3 |pp=38\u201345}}</ref>\n\n===Historiography===\nThe history of women in Quebec was generally neglected before 1980.<ref name=Dumont/> The advent of the feminist movement, combined with the \"[[New social history]]\" that featured the study of ordinary people, created a new demand for a historiography of women.

Instead of austere functionality, they enlivened their living spaces with plush furniture, deep carpets, handmade fancy-work, hanging plants, bookcases, inexpensive paintings and decorations.

Indeed, most human rights activists did not raise the issue before the 1970s, because they were family oriented and subscribed to the deeply embedded ideology of the family wage, whereby the husband should be paid enough so the wife could be a full-time housewife. After lobbying by women, labor unions, and the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF), the Conservative government passed the Female Employees Fair Remuneration Act in 1951. It required equal pay for women who did the same work as men.

Men were primarily responsible for breaking the land; planting and harvesting; building the house; buying, operating and repairing machinery; and handling finances. At first there were many single men on the prairie, or husbands whose wives were still back east, but they had a hard time. They realized the need for a wife. As the population increased rapidly, wives played a central role in settlement of the prairie region. Their labor, skills, and ability to adapt to the harsh environment proved decisive in meeting the challenges. They prepared bannock, beans and bacon, mended clothes, raised children, cleaned, tended the garden, helped at harvest time and nursed everyone back to health. While prevailing patriarchal attitudes, legislation, and economic principles obscured women's contributions, the flexibility exhibited by farm women in performing productive and nonproductive labor was critical to the survival of family farms, and thus to the success of the wheat economy.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Sandra |last=Rollings-Magnusson |title=Canada's Most Wanted: Pioneer Women on the Western Prairies |journal=Canadian Review of Sociology and Anthropology |date=May 2000 |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=223\u2013238 |doi=10.1111/j.1755-618X.2000.tb01265.x}}<br>&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp;{{cite journal |first=Edith |last=Rowles |title=Bannock, beans and bacon: An investigation of pioneer diet |journal=[[Saskatchewan History]] |date=1952 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pp=1\u201316}}</ref>\n\n==Aboriginals==\n[[File:Kenojuak Ashevak 1 1997-05-09 cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Kenojuak Ashevak]] was a Canadian artist.

It was founded, independent of the [[Victorian Order of Nurses]], in 1909 by Jessie Turnbull Robinson. A former nurse, Robinson was elected as president of the Lethbridge Relief Society and began district nursing services aimed at poor women and children. The mission was governed by a volunteer board of women directors and began by raising money for its first year of service through charitable donations and payments from the [[Metropolitan Life Insurance Company]].

Accusing the AAGN of ignoring the medical needs of rural Alberta women, the leaders of the UFWA worked to improve economic and living conditions of women farmers. [[Irene Parlby]], the UFWA's first president, lobbied for the establishment of a provincial Department of Public Health, government-provided hospitals and doctors, and passage of a law to permit nurses to qualify as registered midwives. The AAGN leadership opposed midwife certification, arguing that nursing curricula left no room for midwife study, and thus nurses were not qualified to participate in home births. In 1919 the AAGN compromised with the UFWA, and they worked together for the passage of the Public Health Nurses Act that allowed nurses to serve as midwives in regions without doctors. Thus, Alberta's District Nursing Service, created in 1919 to coordinate the province's women's health resources, resulted chiefly from the organized, persistent political activism of UFWA members and only minimally from the actions of professional nursing groups clearly uninterested in rural Canadians' medical needs.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Sharon |last=Richardson |title=Political Women, Professional Nurses, and the Creation of Alberta's District Nursing Service, 1919-1925 |journal=Nursing History Review |date=1998 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=25\u201350 |pmid=9357295|doi=10.1891/1062-8061.6.1.25 }}</ref>\n\nThe Alberta District Nursing Service administered health care in the predominantly rural and impoverished areas of Alberta in the first half of the 20th century. Founded in 1919 to meet maternal and emergency medical needs by the United Farm Women (UFWA), the Nursing Service treated prairie settlers living in primitive areas lacking doctors and hospitals. Nurses provided prenatal care, worked as midwives, performed minor surgery, conducted medical inspections of schoolchildren, and sponsored immunization programs. The post-Second World War discovery of large oil and gas reserves resulted in economic prosperity and the expansion of local medical services. The passage of provincial health and universal hospital insurance in 1957 precipitated the eventual phasing out of the obsolete District Nursing Service in 1976.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Sharon |last=Richardson |title=Frontier Health Care: Alberta's District and Municipal Nursing Services, 1919 to 1976 |journal=Alberta History |date=1998 |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=2\u20139 |url=http://peel.library.ualberta.ca/bibliography/9021.46.1/4.html}}</ref>\n\n====Military services====\nOver 4000 women served as nurses in uniform in the Canadian Armed Forces during the Second World War.

It started a chapter in Ontario in 1874 and became a national union in 1885; it reached 16,000 members across Canada in 1914. The central demand was for prohibition, a provincial law that was designed to minimize the power of the liquor interests, reduce violence among men, reduce violence towards wives and children, and keep more money in the family. The leadership in most numbers came from evangelical Protestant churches, especially the Methodists and Baptists. Episcopalians seldom joined, and Catholics almost never. They held the plurality should be under the control of the churches, not under the control of private societies or the government.  The  WCTU took the lead in demanding votes for women, Its argument was based on a [[maternal feminist]] position to the effect that women possessed superior moral standards, especially regarding issues affecting the home and family life, and needed the votes to guarantee that the government supported proper public morals.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Sharon Anne |last=Cook |title='Sowing Seed for the Master': The Ontario WCTU |journal=Journal of Canadian Studies |date=1995 |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=175\u2013194 |doi=10.3138/jcs.30.3.175}}<br>&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp;{{cite book|last=Cook|first=Sharon Anne|title=Through Sunshine and Shadow: The Woman's Christian Temperance Union, Evangelicalism, and Reform in Ontario, 1874-1930|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IIrIH7VZhk4C&pg=PP1|year=1995|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |isbn=978-0-7735-1305-1}}</ref>\n\nStarting in the late 1870s the Ontario WCTU demanded that the schools to teach \"scientific temperance,\" which reinforced moralistic temperance messages with the study of anatomy and hygiene, taught as a compulsory subject in schools.

They were the family financiers and encouraged other wives who otherwise might have coaxed their menfolk to accept company terms.

Women's legal rights made slow progress throughout the 19th century. In 1859, [[Upper Canada]] passed a law allowing married women to own property. In 1885, Alberta passed a law allowing unmarried women who owned property gained the right to vote and hold office in school matters.  This early activism was focused on increasing women\u2019s role in public life, with goals including women\u2019s suffrage, increased property rights, increased access to education, and recognition as \"persons\" under the law.<ref name=Prentice1988/> This early iteration of Canadian feminism was largely based in maternal feminism; the idea that women are natural caregivers and \"mothers of the nation\" who should participate in public life because of their perceived propensity for decisions that will result in good care of society. In this view, women were seen to be a civilizing force on society \u2013 which was a significant part of women\u2019s engagement in missionary work and in the [[Woman\u2019s Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU).<ref>{{cite book |editor-last1=Newman |editor-first1=Jacquetta A. |editor-last2=White|editor-first2=Linda Ann |title=Women, Politics, and Public Policy: The Political Struggles of Canadian Women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oTIqAAAAYAAJ&pg=PP1 |year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-541805-7}}</ref>\n\nReligion was an important factor in the early stages of the Canadian women\u2019s movement. Some of the earliest groups of organized women came together for a religious purpose.  When women were rejected as missionaries by their Churches and missionary societies, they started their own missionary societies and raised funds to send female missionaries abroad. Some of them raised enough to train some of their missionaries as teachers or doctors.<ref name=Prentice1988/>\n\nWoman's political status without the vote was vigorously promoted by the [[National Council of Women of Canada]] from 1894 to 1918. It promoted a vision of \"transcendent citizenship\" for women. The ballot was not needed, for citizenship was to be exercised through personal influence and moral suasion, through the election of men with strong moral character, and through raising public-spirited sons. The National Council position was integrated into its nation-building program that sought to uphold Canada as a White settler nation. While the woman suffrage movement was important for extending the political rights of White women, it was also authorized through race-based arguments that linked White women's enfranchisement to the need to protect the nation from \"racial degeneration.\"<ref>{{cite journal |first=Anne-Marie |last=Kinahan |title=Transcendent Citizenship: Suffrage, the National Council of Women of Canada, and the Politics of Organized Womanhood |journal=Journal of Canadian Studies |date=2008 |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=5\u201327 |doi=10.3138/jcs.42.3.5 |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/367036 |url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\nWomen sometimes did have a local vote in some provinces, as in Ontario from 1850, where women who owned property could vote for school trustees.

The Women's Amateur Federation of Canada (WAAF) was formed in 1926 to make possible new opportunities, particularly in international competition. The WAAF worked to rebut the stereotype that vigorous physical activity and intense competition was \"unwomanly\". One tactic was to set up a system of medical supervision for all women athletes. The WAAF forged an alliance with supportive men who dominated the Amateur Athletic Union of Canada; this allowed women to compete in the Olympics and the British Empire Games.\n\nMany barriers fell in the 1920s: the Edmonton Grads became the world champions of women's basketball; the first Canadian women participated in the Olympics; and women sportswriters such as Phyllis Griffiths were hired to cover their feats on the sports pages.\n\nThe 1930s brought setbacks, as critics recommended  non-competitive athletic  activities as the recreation most suited to women. During the 1930s, a team of women from the small town of Preston, Ontario, overcame the difficulty of obtaining adequate ice time for practice, and the challenge of raising adequate funds from their small fan base.

The Fitness and Amateur Sport Act of 1961 (Bill C-131) and the report of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women in 1970 marked major advances. Perhaps the most critical development came in 1974, when Marion Lay and the federal government\u2019s Fitness and Amateur Sport Branch (FASB) sponsored a National Conference on Women and Sport.  it brought together coaches, academic administrators, and athletes to talk over the issues raised by the Royal Commission, and to chart a way forward.  Even so, there was no way to monitor the process and implement the recommendations. The 1980s accelerated the movement forward. The Sport Canada\u2019s Women\u2019s Program in 1980; the Female Athlete Conference in 1981; the Women in Sport program in 1981; and the Constitution Act of 1982. In 1981 Abby Hoffman, a former Olympian, was named director general of Sport Canada. Its  \"Policy on Women's Sport\" called for equality. The AAU of Canada now became more supportive. Court cases nail down the women's right to participate. In the provinces, human rights commissions addressed dozens of sport-related equity cases for women. Gender barriers in sports became a political topic, as shown by the Minister\u2019s Task Force Report in 1992 and the landmark decision of the Canadian Sport Council to include gender equity quotas in their operating principles.  By the 1990s women proved eager to enter formerly all-male sports such as ice hockey, rugby, and wrestling.  Their activism and their prowess on the playing field eroded old stereotypes and opened up new social roles for the woman athlete on campus and in her community. New problems emerged for sportswomen trying to achieve equal status with sportsmen: raising money, attracting popular audiences, and winning sponsors.<ref name=Hall2002/>\n\nHarrigan, (2003) reviews the emergence of women's athletics in higher education during 1961\u20132001. The establishment of the National Fitness and Amateur Sport Advisory Council helped women's intercollegiate sports to gain momentum. simultaneously there was a rise in the proportion of women in the student bodies, which enhanced the visibility of their sports. To overcome institutional inertia, women concentrated on organizing their sports and raising the consciousness of both male and female students.

He began his attack by entering a classroom at the university, where he separated the male and female students. After claiming that he was \"fighting feminism\" and calling the women \"a bunch of feminists,\" he shot all nine women in the room, killing six. He then moved through corridors, the cafeteria, and another classroom, specifically targeting women to shoot. Overall, he killed fourteen women and injured ten other women and four men in just under 20 minutes before turning the gun on himself.<ref name=\"coroner\">{{cite report |last=Sourour |first=Teresa K. |date=10 May 1991 |url=http://www.diarmani.com/Montreal_Coroners_Report.pdf |title=Report of Coroner's Investigation }}</ref><ref name=\"injured\">{{cite news |last=Buchignani|first=Walter|title=Amid the tragedy, miracles of survival|page=A3|newspaper=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]] |location=Montreal|date=8 December 1989}}</ref> [[Marc L\u00e9pine#L\u00e9pine's suicide statement|His suicide note]] claimed political motives and blamed feminists for ruining his life.

These dealt principally with pimping, procuring, operating brothels and soliciting. Most amendments to date have dealt with the latter, originally classified as a vagrancy offence, this was amended to soliciting in 1972, and communicating in 1985. Since the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] became law in 1982, the constitutionality of Canada's prostitution laws have been challenged on a number of occasions.\n\nUp to the 1880s prostitution was tolerated in The Prairie provinces. Before 1909 there were few arrests and even fewer fines for prostitution, in part because those caught were encouraged to leave town rather than be jailed. As the population became more settled, however, public opinion regarding this resource for itinerant men turned hostile.   For example, a smallpox epidemic in the red light districts of Calgary ignited a crackdown as demanded by middle-class women reformers. Local chapters of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] vigorously opposed both saloons and prostitution, and called for woman suffrage as a tool to end those evils.<ref name=Sheehan1981/><ref>{{cite journal |first=Judy |last=Bedford |title=Prostitution In Calgary 1905-1914 |journal=Alberta History |date=1981 |volume=29|issue=2|pp=1\u201311 |url=http://peel.library.ualberta.ca/bibliography/9021.29.2/3.html}}</ref>\n\n==Historiography and recognition==\n[[File:Louise McKinney 1.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Louise McKinney]] in Calgary, Alberta.

In 1966 he married and decided to move to the United States, applying to numerous American art colleges for work before eventually being accepted by [[Maryland Institute College of Art]] in [[Baltimore]], where he was offered a place in 1967 on a [[Master of Fine Arts]] programme with associated teaching work.\n\n===Baltimore and the move to photo-realism===\n[[File:JohnSalt Sportwagon.jpg|left|thumb|''Sportwagon'' (1969), oil on canvas.]]\nSalt's work at this time showed influences of both [[abstract expressionism]] and [[Pop Art]] \u2013 the two pre-eminent artistic movements of the time. Unhappy at the prospect of merely selecting which of a pre-existing set of styles he was to adopt, however, Salt sought a more distinct artistic identity and was encouraged to explore a wide variety of styles and techniques by [[Grace Hartigan]], who was the head of the graduate programme at Baltimore and a major influence on Salt's early career.<ref name=\"earlyyears\" />\n\nIt was at this time that Salt discovered the book ''Contemporary Photographers towards a Social Landscape'', featuring the work of photographers [[Garry Winogrand]] and [[Lee Friedlander]], in the Baltimore college library. Impressed at how the photographers' documentary style relieved them of the self-conscious need to adopt an artistic technique, Salt photocopied the book with an eye to painting some of its images.<ref name=\"earlyyears\" />\n\nSalt's painting ''Untitled'' (1967) was a pivotal work in this respect, being very closely based on Winogrand's photograph ''New York City'' (1959); both featuring a closely zoomed image of the inside of a car viewed from the outside. Despite the very high degree of similarity between the compositions, Salt's painting was still clearly an artistic interpretation of the photograph, however. Salt realised that if he was to eliminate all traces of expressionism in his work he had to record the image as faithfully as possible, and his next series of paintings \u2013 the first of his mature style \u2013 featured a series of paintings of car upholstery reproduced directly from a [[Buick]] catalogue.\n\n[[Alex Katz]], reviewing Salt's work as an external assessor for the college, skipped over Salt's expressionist work before remarking about the Buick works \"Oh this is better. This may not even be art.\"<ref name=\"earlyyears\" />\n\n===New York City===\nSalt had originally planned to return to England at the end of his Baltimore course in 1969, but when two of his Buick works were bought by an influential New York City art dealer he took Hartigan's advice and moved there instead. \n\nSalt's work in New York moved away from the earlier smooth [[consumerism|consumerist]] portrayals of car interiors as he started to base his paintings on his own photographs. Initially these featured exterior shots of more worn vehicles, but after his discovery of a scrapyard under [[Brooklyn Bridge]], his work began to feature images of cars mangled and wrecked to the point of violence.\n\nNew York City also saw Salt develop a relationship with the art dealer Ivan Karp, who was on the point of opening his own gallery and was to develop a portfolio of artists associated with the emerging [[photorealism|photorealist]] movement. Salt had his first one-man exhibition in New York in 1969 and in 1972 featured in the [[documenta 5]] exhibition in [[Kassel]], Germany where the photorealist school first gained an international profile,<ref name=\"Culture24\">{{cite web|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/places+to+go/west+midlands/birmingham/art19085|title=An Optical Illusion at the Southampton City Art Gallery|accessdate=27 November 2009|publisher=Culture24}}</ref> since when he has exhibited widely worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meiselgallery.com/LKMG/salt/saltBioFrameset.html|title=John Salt \u2013 Biography|accessdate=20 October 2007|publisher=Louis K.

Under the influence of [[John Clem Clarke]] he increasingly used an [[airbrush]] instead of a spray gun, with [[stencil]]s to obtain the detail and precision he sought. His subject matter also broadened to include [[pick-up truck]]s and [[mobile homes]], with the use of his own photography encouraging a deliberately informal [[Snapshot (photography)|snapshot]]-like composition.<ref name=\"elegy\">{{cite book|last=Chase|first=Linda|authorlink=|author2=|editor=|others=|title=John Salt: The Complete Works 1969\u20132006|year=2007|publisher=Philip Wilson Publishers|location=London|isbn=0-85667-634-9|pages=45\u201359|chapter=Elegy in an Auto-graveyard}}</ref>\n\n===Return to England===\nSalt returned to England in 1978<ref name=\"ngs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgalleries.org/collection/online_az/4:322/?initial=S&artistId=4812&artistName=John%20Salt&submit=1|title=John Salt (English, born 1937) |accessdate=21 October 2007|publisher=National Galleries of Scotland}}</ref> and settled in [[Bucknell, Shropshire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plusonegallery.com/Artist-Info.cfm?ArtistsID=377&Object=|title=John Salt|accessdate=20 October 2007|publisher=Plus One Gallery, London}}</ref> His work in England has largely continued to feature American scenes, however. Salt explained: \"I think in a way it [America] has that removed quality I quite like, and also the light is much sharper, you get incredibly clear light, much harder, it's much softer in Britain, it doesn't quite have that edge \u2013 edge in every way, in light and subject matter.\"<ref name=\"cityliving\" /> On another occasion he commented \"I've tried desperately to paint British subject matter.

In 1966 he married and decided to move to the United States, applying to numerous American art colleges for work before eventually being accepted by [[Maryland Institute College of Art]] in [[Baltimore]], where he was offered a place in 1967 on a [[Master of Fine Arts]] programme with associated teaching work.\n\n===Baltimore and the move to photo-realism===\n[[File:JohnSalt Sportwagon.jpg|left|thumb|''Sportwagon'' (1969), oil on canvas.]]\nSalt's work at this time showed influences of both [[abstract expressionism]] and [[Pop Art]] \u2013 the two pre-eminent artistic movements of the time. Unhappy at the prospect of merely selecting which of a pre-existing set of styles he was to adopt, however, Salt sought a more distinct artistic identity and was encouraged to explore a wide variety of styles and techniques by [[Grace Hartigan]], who was the head of the graduate programme at Baltimore and a major influence on Salt's early career.<ref name=\"earlyyears\" />\n\nIt was at this time that Salt discovered the book ''Contemporary Photographers towards a Social Landscape'', featuring the work of photographers [[Garry Winogrand]] and [[Lee Friedlander]], in the Baltimore college library. Impressed at how the photographers' documentary style relieved them of the self-conscious need to adopt an artistic technique, Salt photocopied the book with an eye to painting some of its images.<ref name=\"earlyyears\" />\n\nSalt's painting ''Untitled'' (1967) was a pivotal work in this respect, being very closely based on Winogrand's photograph ''New York City'' (1959); both featuring a closely zoomed image of the inside of a car viewed from the outside. Despite the very high degree of similarity between the compositions, Salt's painting was still clearly an artistic interpretation of the photograph, however. Salt realised that if he was to eliminate all traces of expressionism in his work he had to record the image as faithfully as possible, and his next series of paintings \u2013 the first of his mature style \u2013 featured a series of paintings of car upholstery reproduced directly from a [[Buick]] catalogue.\n\n[[Alex Katz]], reviewing Salt's work as an external assessor for the college, skipped over Salt's expressionist work before remarking about the Buick works \"Oh this is better. This may not even be art.\"<ref name=\"earlyyears\" />\n\n===New York City===\nSalt had originally planned to return to England at the end of his Baltimore course in 1969, but when two of his Buick works were bought by an influential New York City art dealer he took Hartigan's advice and moved there instead. \n\nSalt's work in New York moved away from the earlier smooth [[consumerism|consumerist]] portrayals of car interiors as he started to base his paintings on his own photographs. Initially these featured exterior shots of more worn vehicles, but after his discovery of a scrapyard under [[Brooklyn Bridge]], his work began to feature images of cars mangled and wrecked to the point of violence.\n\nNew York City also saw Salt develop a relationship with the art dealer Ivan Karp, who was on the point of opening his own gallery and was to develop a portfolio of artists associated with the emerging [[photorealism|photorealist]] movement. Salt had his first one-man exhibition in New York in 1969 and in 1972 featured in the [[documenta 5]] exhibition in [[Kassel]], Germany where the photorealist school first gained an international profile,<ref name=\"Culture24\">{{cite web|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/places+to+go/west+midlands/birmingham/art19085|title=An Optical Illusion at the Southampton City Art Gallery|accessdate=27 November 2009|publisher=Culture24}}</ref> since when he has exhibited widely worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meiselgallery.com/LKMG/salt/saltBioFrameset.html|title=John Salt \u2013 Biography|accessdate=20 October 2007|publisher=Louis K.

Under the influence of [[John Clem Clarke]] he increasingly used an [[airbrush]] instead of a spray gun, with [[stencil]]s to obtain the detail and precision he sought. His subject matter also broadened to include [[pick-up truck]]s and [[mobile homes]], with the use of his own photography encouraging a deliberately informal [[Snapshot (photography)|snapshot]]-like composition.<ref name=\"elegy\">{{cite book|last=Chase|first=Linda|authorlink=|author2=|editor=|others=|title=John Salt: The Complete Works 1969\u20132006|year=2007|publisher=Philip Wilson Publishers|location=London|isbn=0-85667-634-9|pages=45\u201359|chapter=Elegy in an Auto-graveyard}}</ref>\n\n===Return to England===\nSalt returned to England in 1978<ref name=\"ngs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgalleries.org/collection/online_az/4:322/?initial=S&artistId=4812&artistName=John%20Salt&submit=1|title=John Salt (English, born 1937) |accessdate=21 October 2007|publisher=National Galleries of Scotland}}</ref> and settled in [[Bucknell, Shropshire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plusonegallery.com/Artist-Info.cfm?ArtistsID=377&Object=|title=John Salt|accessdate=20 October 2007|publisher=Plus One Gallery, London}}</ref> His work in England has largely continued to feature American scenes, however.

Downtown Kansas City, Missouri, is immediately southeast of their intersection and [[North Kansas City, Missouri]], is to its northeast.]]\n\nThe larger ''Kansas City [[Metropolitan Area]]'' as seen on a map can be visualized roughly as four quadrants:\n\nThe southeast quadrant includes [[Kansas City, Missouri]], and surrounding areas in Missouri. It includes the notorious [[Grandview Triangle]].\n\nThe southwest quadrant includes all of [[Johnson County, Kansas]], which includes the towns in the area known as [[Shawnee Mission, Kansas]]. [[Interstate 35]] runs diagonally through [[Johnson County, Kansas]], from the southwest to downtown [[Kansas City, Missouri]].\n\nThe northwest quadrant contains [[Wyandotte County, Kansas|Wyandotte]], and [[Leavenworth County, Kansas|Leavenworth]], counties in Kansas and parts of [[Platte County, Missouri]]. Wyandotte County, Kansas (sometimes referred to as just [[Wyandotte County, Kansas|Wyandotte]]), contains [[Kansas City, Kansas]]; [[Bonner Springs, Kansas]]; and [[Edwardsville, Kansas]]; it is governed by a single unified government. Often the [[Wyandotte County, Kansas|Wyandotte]] government is referred to simply as \"The Unified Government\". Another bend in the [[Missouri River]] forms the county line between\n[[Wyandotte County, Kansas]], and [[Platte County, Missouri]], to the north and northeast.\n\nThe map's northeast quadrant is locally referred to as \"north of the river\" or \"the Northland\".

[[North Kansas City, Missouri|North Kansas City]], is bounded by a bend in the [[Missouri River]] that defines a border between [[Wyandotte County, Kansas]], and [[Clay County, Missouri]], running approximately North-South and a border between [[North Kansas City, Missouri]], and [[Kansas City, Missouri]], running approximately East-West.\nThe river bend's sharpest part forms a [[peninsula]] containing the [[Kansas City Downtown Airport]].\n\n==Divisions of the Kansas City metropolitan area==\n\n===Jackson County, Missouri===\n\n\"Downtown (KCMO)\"\n{{main|Downtown Kansas City}}\nDowntown almost always refers to downtown [[Kansas City, Missouri]] which has a population of 25,204.<ref>https://www.niche.com/places-to-live/n/greater-downtown-kansas-city-mo/</ref> Downtown is Kansas City's historic center, located entirely within Kansas City, Missouri, and containing the city's original town site, business districts, and residential neighborhoods. Downtown is bounded by the Missouri River on the north, the Missouri-Kansas state line on the west, 31st Street on the south and Woodland Avenue on the east. The downtown area includes the [[Central Business District]] and its buildings, which form the city's skyline. The [[Downtown Loop (Kansas City)|Downtown Loop]] is formed by Interstates 670, 70 and 35. Within the downtown loop are many of the tall buildings and skyscrapers that make up the city's skyline. The downtown loop also has small, distinct neighborhoods such as [[Quality Hill, Kansas City|Quality Hill]], the [[Garment District (Kansas City, Missouri)|Garment District]], the [[Financial District (Kansas City, Missouri)|Financial District]], the [[Bartle Hall Convention Center|Convention Center]] District, and the [[Power and Light District]].\n\nOther neighborhoods within downtown are the [[River Market, Kansas City|River Market]] and Columbus Park, both located between the downtown loop and the [[Missouri River]]. Between the downtown loop and the state line are the Westside neighborhood and the [[West Bottoms]], located at the bottom of the bluff adjacent to [[Kaw Point]]. East of the loop are the 18th & Vine District, the North Bottoms, and Northeast Kansas City (the East Bottoms, Northeast, and [[Pendleton Heights, Kansas City|Pendleton Heights]]). South of the loop is the [[Crossroads, Kansas City|Crossroads District]], [[Union Hill, Kansas City|Union Hill]], [[Crown Center, Kansas City|Crown Center]], [[Hospital Hill]], Longfellow, Wendell Phillips, and Washington Wheatley.\n\nThe [[Kansas City Convention Center]], [[Municipal Auditorium (Kansas City)|Municipal Auditorium]], [[City Hall (Kansas City)|City Hall]], [[Lyric Theatre (Kansas City, Missouri)|Lyric Theater]], [[Midland Theatre]], Ilus Davis Park, and [[Barney Allis Plaza]] are within the Central Business District inside the downtown loop. The [[Sprint Center]] and the [[College Basketball Experience]] are within the Power & Light District, also within the downtown loop. The [[Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts]] is perched upon a high point immediately south of the downtown loop. South of the loop is the [[Crossroads, Kansas City|Crossroads District]], [[Union Station (Kansas City, Missouri)|Union Station]], [[Crown Center]], the [[National World War I Museum]], [[Liberty Memorial]], [[Penn Valley Park]], [[Truman Medical Center-Hospital Hill|Truman Medical Center]], [[Children's Mercy Hospital]], and the 18th & Vine District. North of the loop are City Market within the [[River Market]] and Richard L. Berkeley Riverfront Park. West of the loop within the West Bottoms are [[Kemper Arena]] and [[Hale Arena]].\n\n\"Midtown/Plaza (KCMO)\"\n\nMidtown/Plaza is entirely within Kansas City, Missouri with a population of 40,355.<ref>https://www.niche.com/places-to-live/n/midtown---plaza-kansas-city-mo/</ref> It is just south of downtown, and bounded by 31st Street on the north, the state line on the west, West Gregory Boulevard (71st Street) on the south, and [[Troost Avenue]] on the east. Midtown/Plaza, the core of the metropolitan area, has many cultural attractions, shopping and entertainment areas, large hospitals, universities, and the metro area's most densely populated neighborhoods.\n\nMidtown/Plaza has many distinct and historic neighborhoods, including [[Westport, Kansas City|Westport]], [[Hyde Park, Kansas City|Hyde Park]], and [[Southmoreland]]. Shopping is centered on the Country Club Plaza, which has luxury retailers, hotels, and restaurants.

{"title_page": "History of Canadian newspapers", "text_new": "{{Culture of Canada sidebar}}\n\nThere were five important periods in the '''history of Canadian newspapers'''' responsible for the eventual development of the modern newspaper. These are the \"Transplant Period\" from 1750\u20131800, when printing and newspapers initially came to Canada as publications of government news and proclamations; followed by the \"Partisan Period from 1800\u20131850,\" when individual printers and editors played a growing role in politics. The \"Nation Building Period from 1850\u20131900,\" when Canadian editors began the work of establishing a common nationalistic view of Canadian society. The \"Modern period\" from 1900 to 1980s saw the professionalization of the industry and the growth of chains. \"Current history\" since the 1990s saw outside interests take over the chains, as they faced new competition from the Internet.\n\n==Transplant period 1750-1800==\nThere were no printing presses; in this time, and no newspaper of any kind, under the French regime. All the newspapers in the British colonies had been transplanted from the 13 American colonies.<ref name=Fetherline />\n\nThe press in Canada was born as a tool of the government to print official government documents.  \"The discovery of such unrealized potential frightened the powers that be, who commenced a centuries-long period of harassment and intimidation in order to check what today is called the power of the press\".<ref name=Fetherline />  Information that was hostile to the government was definitely not welcome especially after the end of the [[American Revolution]] in 1783. It brought a wave of United Empire Loyalists.<ref name=Fetherline />\n\nEventually, the Canadian printers began the process of printing more than just government news and proclamations. Many of the early editors and printers were, government or influential, personalities who used their newspapers as instruments of their own political beliefs; and suffered great hardships at the hands of the government because of the oppression they faced.<ref name=Raible /> There was little local news printed, and little news from other Canadian places, since there was no system of exchanging newspapers among editors. The first advertising started to appear in the 1780s. The Quebec Gazette of 12 July 1787 had a classified ad:\n:For sale, a robust Negress, active and with good hearing, about 18 years old, who has had small-pox, has been accustomed to household duties, understands the kitchen, knows how to wash, iron, sew, and very used to caring for children. She can adapt itself equally to an English, French or German family, he speaks all three languages.<ref>W.H. Kesterton, A history of journalism in Canada. (McClelland and Stewart, 1967) p 7</ref>\n\n=== Gazettes and American transplants ===\nThis was the period that introduced print culture to British North America and began fostering a reading public. All newspapers but ''The Upper Canada Gazette'' were started by Americans. In 1783, some 60,000 Loyalists migrated after the American Revolution, with around 30,000 moving to Canada- bringing printing presses with them. All of the first newspapers started life as official government organs. They were all dependent on government patronage and printed solely information condoned by the government. In every province, there was a weekly \"Gazette\" (named after ''[[The London Gazette]]'', the English governmental organ since 1665) that carried the many notices colonial administrators wanted to circulate.<ref name=Raible />\n\nAt this time, there was no \"political sphere\", as all political news was controlled by the elite.<ref name=Raible /> In the early decades of British North America, the primary purpose of the press was to propagate official propaganda - freedom of the press was an alien idea.<ref name=Raible /> Prior to the approximate turn of the 18th into the 19th century, there was no \"public sphere\" in Canada and therefore no press in the public sphere.\n\n===First printers and publishers===\nIt was the first printers and publishers working during the turn of the century who began the slow and difficult work of creating a true, liberated press in Canada. These men faced many obstacles, including beatings, jailing, and the very serious and oft-carried out threat of being charged with criminal or seditious libel. As the early printing press was an essential tool of colonial administration, anyone who attempted to publish anything other than the government notices experienced hardships. There was a prohibition on publishing legislature proceedings which kept the writers out of the courts. These were colonial laws used by British authorities to manufacture loyalty, and the punishments were severe.<ref name=Fetherline /><ref name=Raible /> As a result, many of these brave early printers and publishers lived in fear, massive debt, and constant persecution.\n\n==== John Bushell (1715-1761) ====\n{{main|John Bushell}}\n\nBushell partnered with [[Bartholomew Green (printer, born 1699)|Bartholomew Green]] (1690\u20131751) who died before their plans were realized. Bushell relocated from Boston to Halifax and opened up a printing office, and on March 23, 1752, Bushell published the first edition of the ''[[Halifax Gazette]]'' and became the colony's first \"King's Printer\".<ref name=Raible /> He was an independent entrepreneur, given no government salary,<ref name=Fetherline /> and what government administrators thought their subjects needed and what Bushell's subscribers and advertisers wanted were not necessarily the same. He was stuck in between. The government did not trust his loyalty and so made the Provincial Secretary the editor of his paper.<ref name=Raible /> Bushell, faced with these obstacles, struggled with debt and alcoholism which eventually led to his death.<ref name=Raible />\n\n====Anton Heinrich (1734-1800)====\n{{main|Henry B. Anthony}}\n\nHeinrich learned his trade in Germany but came to America as a fifer in the British Army before relocating to Halifax and anglicizing his name to the more appropriate Henry Anthony.<ref name=Raible /> Henry acquired Bushell's enterprise, including the ''Gazette''. In October 1765 he printed an editorial in the ''Gazette'' that suggested that Nova Scotians were opposed to the [[Stamp Act]] which resulted in doubts about his loyalty, and he fled back to Massachusetts and the ''Gazette'' was shut down. Eventually, he made his way back into the government's good graces and was recommissioned to print the ''Royal Gazette''.<ref name=Dictionary />\n\n==== William Brown (1737-1789) and Thomas Gilmore (1741-1773) ====\nOriginally from Philadelphia,<ref name=Dictionary /> in 1764 the two men launched the government sponsored [[Quebec Gazette]]. The paper was bilingual and was heavily censured and scrutinized by the government.<ref name=Raible /><ref name=Dictionary />\n\n====Fleury Mesplet (1734-1794)====\n{{main|Fleury Mesplet}}\nImmigrated to Montreal from France with the intent of being a printer. However, he was jailed out of suspicion before printing anything due to his status as an American sympathizer and relationship with Benjamin Franklin.<ref name=Dictionary /> In 1778 he printed Canada's first entirely French newspaper, [[The Gazette (Montreal)]]. His editor, Valentin Jautard, chose articles with a radical tone and both men were imprisoned. In 1782, Mesplet was released and allowed to go back to work for the government because he was the only capable printer, though he technically remained imprisoned.<ref name=Raible />\n\n====Louis Roy (1771-1799)====\nOn April 18, 1793, Roy launched the ''Upper Canada Gazette'', which continued until 1849. In 1797, Roy left the paper due to political persecution after printing some incendiary opinions and fled to New York.<ref name=Dictionary />\n\n==Partisan period (1800-1850)==\n\nThis is the period in which the printers and publishers began to see success in their efforts to free the press from its government control. The papers were organs of political parties and editors often played major roles in local politics.The discussion and debate surrounding the \"public sphere\" in the North Atlantic was actively undertaken in Upper Canada and partisan newspapers of the 1800s became \"pure\" inhabitants of the public sphere.<ref name=Fetherline /> Big steps were taken towards the democratization of the press, and in 1891, the right to report on political proceedings was finally won.<ref name=Fetherline /> The papers of this period were non-deferential, and demanded democratization of information. They undermined finally began to undermine the traditional hierarchical societal structure.<ref>James John Talman, \"The Newspapers of Upper Canada a Century Ago.\" ''Canadian Historical Review'' 19#1 (1938): 9-23.</ref>\n\n===Printers and publishers===\nThe development of the public sphere in Canada was closely linked with the development of a free press and there are many parallels. Most of the early publishers were - or became - very active politicians up to the mid-1800s.\nAt this time, there was a growing market for political debate, and the independent printers of this period began using their columns for opinions, to challenge policies, expose government errors, and even promote certain candidates. These men were large personalities, unafraid to strongly voice unpopular opinions. As a result, the newspapers often became a forum for debate between the disagreeing printers.\n\nThe political issue most often debated was that of [[responsible government]]. In responsible government the executive branch is responsible to the elected legislature and no laws can be passed without the approval of said legislature. However, in Upper Canada, the appointed executive remained responsible only to the colonial governor who had to answer to Britain until 1855. Many of the publisher and printer/politicians of this time were debating this key issue.\n\nDuring this period the printers were still working under very difficult conditions. Like the printers before them, many of the printers and publishers were still plagued by debt and had to work tirelessly to earn enough to support their political careers and keep the newspapers running. These men continued the difficult work of liberating the Canadian press and it is in the stories of these men that we start to see some success along with the difficulty.\n[[Image:Le Canadien Nov 22, 1806.jpg|275px|thumb|border|''Le Canadien'', November 22, 1806, vol. 1, no 1.]]\n\n====Le Canadien====\n\"[[Le Canadien]]\" was a French weekly newspaper  published in [[Lower Canada]] from November 22, 1806 to March 14, 1810. Its motto was: ''\"Nos institutions, notre langue et nos droits\"'' (Our institutions, our language, our rights).  It was the political mouthpiece of the [[Parti canadien]], the voice of the liberal elite and merchants.  It repeatedly editorialized for responsible government, and spoke out in a defense of the Canadiens and their traditions against the British rulers, while professing loyalty to the king. In 1810 Governor [[James Henry Craig|James Craig]] had the editor [[Pierre B\u00e9dard]] and his colleagues at the paper arrested and imprisoned without trial for the criticism they published.  The paper was reestablished in the 1830s under [[\u00c9tienne Parent]], who was imprisoned for advocating responsible government in 1839.  During the rebellion era, it criticized the Durham report, opposed the union with Upper Canada, and supported the Lafontaine ministry.  It was a mainstay of Liberalism until it closed at the end of the century.<ref>Louis-Georges Harvey,  \"Canadien, Le,\" ''Oxford Companion to Canadian History'' (2006)  p 111</ref>\n\n====Gideon and Sylvester Tiffany====\nThese brothers started as official government printers in the 1790s, but refused to print only government sanctioned news and instead printed news from America. When they refused to heed warnings from the government, they were more formally persecuted. In April 1797, Gideon was charged with blasphemy, fired, fined, and jailed. Sylvester was then also charged with \"treasonable and seditious conduct\". In his defense he declared that \"As the people's printer, it is my duty to devote my head, heart and hands to their service...The interests of the King and people are inseparable\".<ref name=Raible /> Eventually the brothers were forced to give up printing, through Sylvester attempted a number of other papers before moving to New York.\n\n====Titus Geer Simons====\nSimmons was appointed as the new King's printer following the legal persecution of the Tiffany brothers, though he was not officially trained in printing. The Tiffany brothers remained on, and continued to determine much of the paper's content until 1799.<ref name=Dictionary />\n\n====William Lyon Mackenzie====\n{{main|William Lyon Mackenzie|Colonial Advocate}}\n\nMackenzie was a great influence for political development in [[Upper Canada]] (Ontario) and a fierce advocate for '''responsible government'''. In 1824, he founded the ''Colonial Advocate'', which was the first independent paper in the province to have significant political impact.<ref name=Raible /><ref name=\"Colonial Advocate\"/> Mackenzie viewed the colonial administration as incompetent, ineffective, and expensive, and he used the ''Advocate'' to publicize these opinions. Though the paper became the most widely circulated paper, it was not profitable for Mackenzie and he struggled with debt for many years. In 1826 his printing office was broken into and destroyed by a mob. When MacKenzie sued the assailants, he won his case and collected enough in damages to repair the press and pay off his debts, as well as gain public sympathy.<ref name=Dictionary />  Mackenzie is a prime example of an editor who used his printing as a tool to take on the troubled politics of the time and open the door for the newspaper to enter the public sphere.<ref>David Flint, ''William Lyon Mackenzie, Rebel Against Authority'' (Oxford University Press, 1971)</ref>\n\n====Joseph Howe====\n{{main|Joseph Howe}}\n[[Image:Joe Howe1.JPG|thumb|right|275px|Howe's slogan displayed on the ''ChronicleHerald'' building in downtown Halifax.]]\n\nIn 1828, Joseph Howe took over Halifax's ''Weekly Chronicle'', renaming it the ''Acadian''. He then also purchased the ''[[Novascotian]]''. His aggressive journalism made him the voice of Nova Scotia.  Originally he was very loyal to the British government, But his growing trust ration shifted his loyalties to Nova Scotia. Howe, like MacKenzie, demanded home rule in the name of \"responsible government\".<ref>Lorna Inness, \"Joseph Howe: Journalist.,\" ''Nova Scotia Historical Quarterly'' (1973) 3#3  pp 159-170.</ref>\n\nIn 1835, Howe was prosecuted for criminal libel for one of his articles. He spoke in argument for a free press at his trial and though he was technically guilty according to the law, the jury was quick to acquit. His success during his trial made him a local hero in Nova Scotia. It was this success that took Howe into the provincial parliament, and he eventually became a provincial premier.<ref>J. Murray Beck, ''Joseph Howe: Conservative Reformer 1804\u20131848'' (v.1 (1982)</ref>\n\n====Henry David Winton (1793-1855)====\nWinton arrived in Newfoundland on August 28, 1818. In 1820, he founded the ''Public Ledger and Newfoundland General Advisor'', the fourth newspaper in St. John's. Winton used the paper to publish his own political ideas staunchly in support of responsible government. Because of his strong political sentiments he eventually became the enemy of Catholics as well as those in favor of reform - to the extent that some people wished him harm. On May 19, 1835, Winton was attacked by a group of unknown assailants and his ears were cut off. Despite this and further similar threats, Winton continued to write in opposition of the reform government until his death.<ref name=Dictionary />\n\n====John Ryan (1761-1847) and William Lewis====\nRyan was an American expatriate who, in 1807 and with the help of William Lewis, published the first issue of the ''Royal St. John's Gazette'', the earliest newspaper in Newfoundland. Ryan soon began exposing government favoritism and unfairness in the Gazette, much to the chagrin of officials. In March 1784, both men were indicted for libel.<ref name=Dictionary />\n\n====Joseph Willcocks (1773-1814)====\n{{main|Joseph Willcocks}}\nIn 1806, Willcocks moved to Niagara where he began publishing the ''Upper Canada Guardian; or Freeman's Journal'' which he used as a vehicle for his political opinions and criticisms. That same year, he was jailed for contempt of the house.\nin 1808, he rejoined politics officially and became Canada's first true leader of the Opposition against those aligned with the colonial government. He stopped printing his journal in 1812. In July 1813, he offered his services to the Americans while holding a seat in the Legislative Assembly and was formally charged with treason in 1814.<ref name=Dictionary />\n\n== Nation-building and myth-making period (1850-1900) ==\n[[File:The Evening Star Montreal 1869.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The Montreal ''Evening Star'' in 1869]]\nEditors were now free from direct governmental control. However, the government continued to influence them in other underhanded ways, such as privately persuading editorial content and putting paid advertising only into assenting newspapers.<ref name=Raible /> For the most part, the radical newspapers of the Public Sphere Period had served their purposes and the papers of this period were somewhat more unbiased. More than ever, technology and progress were of great importance.\n\nThe papers of this time took on the role of establishing the Canadian identity. In publications of this period, there was a celebration of conformity and orthodoxy. Unlike the incendiary publications of the past, there was no justification seen for the rejection of order.<ref name=Fetherline />\n\n===Printers and publishers===\nDuring this period, largely free from the government restrictions of the past, that the printers and publishers took on the role of establishing the Canadian identity. As before, many of them were personally involved in politics as well and continued to use their papers to exert their political sentiments and to push for progress and change.\n\n====George Brown (1818-1880)====\n<!-- [[File:Canada_Stamp_-_George_Brown.jpg|thumb|none]] -->\n[[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]]  (1818\u20131880) and his father immigrated to Toronto from Scotland in 1837; in 1843 they founded the \"Banner,\" a Presbyterian weekly supporting Free Kirk principles and political reform. In 1844, Brown founded [[The Globe and Mail]], a paper with strong political ambitions. Brown bought out many competitors and increased circulation using advanced technology. By 1860 it was Canada's largest newspaper.  In the 1850s, Brown entered politics and became the Reform Party leader and eventually reached an agreement that led to the Confederation and the founding of the Dominion of Canada. Afterwards, he resigned from Parliament, but continued to promote his political views in the \"Globe\".  Brown fought endless battles with the typographical union from 1843 to 1872. He paid union wages not because of generosity but only when the power of the union forced it upon him. In 1880 he was killed by an angry ex-employee.<ref <ref>Sally Zerker, \"George Brown and the Printers Union,\" ''Journal of Canadian Studies'' (1975) 10#1 pp 42-48.</ref>\n\n====Modeste Demers (1809-1871)====\nIn Victoria in 1856, Bishop Modeste Demers imported a hand press intending to publish religious materials. It remained unused until 1858, when the American printer Frederick Marriott used the \"Demers press\" to publish four different British Columbia newspapers, the most influential of which was the ''British Colonist''. The Demers press continued to be used for printing until 1908.<ref name=Dictionary />\n\n====Amor De Cosmos (1825-1897)====\n{{main|Amor De Cosmos}}\n\nAmor De Cosmos was the founder of the \"British Colonist\".  He was well known for using its pages to express his political opinions.\nDe Cosmos also eventually entered politics, assumed leadership, urged political reform and pushed for \"responsible government''. He was elected to represent Victoria in the House of Commons while at the same time serving as the provincial premiere of British Columbia.\nHe was outspoken and eccentric, and made quite a few enemies throughout his life. He was accused of a scandal with the unions which eventually forced him to leave politics. When he died he had fallen into a complete breakdown.<ref name=Raible /><ref name=Dictionary />\n\n==Modern period from 1900 to 1980s==\n\n===Changing economics===\nStarting in the 1870s, new aggressive publishers included [[Hugh Graham, 1st Baron Atholstan|Hugh Graham]] at the ''[[Montreal Star]]'', and [[John Ross Robertson]] at the ''[[Toronto Telegram]]'', the voice of working-class Orange Protestantism. They adapted the model of the American penny press and sold cheap newspapers with a strong partisan slant and an emphasis on local news of crime, scandal, and corruption. Entertainment news became increasingly prominent, especially the comings and goings of celebrities. Sports gained increasing attention as the readers followed the ups and downs of their local teams. New features were added to attract women, including articles on fashions, grooming, and recipes. The new technology made printing cheaper and faster, and encouraged multiple editions that provided updated news throughout the day in the major cities.  The ''Montreal Star''  by 1899, sold 52,600 copies a day, and by 1913 40% of its circulation was outside of Montreal. It dominated the English-language market.\n\nIn 1900, most Canadian newspapers were local affairs, designed primarily to inform local partisans about the provincial and national political scene. The publishers depended on loyal partisan subscribers, as well as  contracts for public printing  controlled by the political parties. Objectivity was not the goal, as the editors and reporters endeavored to reinforce the partisan  attitudes on major public questions.<ref>Paul  Rutherford, ''A Victorian authority: the daily press in late nineteenth-century Canada'' (1982)</ref>\n\nIn the 1910s, the newspaper industry consolidated as dailies closed, chains formed, and rivals cooperated through press associations and news services. A key factor was advertising--the larger the audience the better, but partisanship reduced potential circulation to members of only one party. In the 19th century  advertisers used papers that shared their political leanings.  But now national advertising agencies adopted new media buying practices. They became nonpartisan and favoured papers with the highest circulation.  The companies placing ads wanted to reach the maximum possible audience regardless of partisanship. The result was a series of consolidations yielding much larger, largely nonpartisan newspapers, which depended more heavily on advertising revenue than on subscriptions from loyal party members. By 1900, three-fourths of the revenue of Toronto newspapers came from advertising. About two thirds of the newspapers' editorial pages loyally supported either the Conservative or the Liberal party, while the remainder were more independent. Regardless of the editorial page, the news pages increasingly prioritized objectivity and bipartisanship. The publishers were focused on advertising revenues that were proportionate to overall circulation. A newspaper that appealed only to one party cut its potential audience in half. Simultaneously, the rapid growth of industry in Ontario and Quebec, coupled with the rapid settlement of the prairies, produced a large more affluent newspaper-reading population. The result was a golden age for Canadian newspapers peaking about 1911.  Many papers failed during the war era. Advertising agencies in 1915 gained a major advantage with the arrival of the [[Audit Bureau of Circulations]], which for the first-time provided reliable data on circulation, as opposed to the partisan boasting and exaggeration that had been the norm. the agencies now had a stronger hand in bargaining for lower advertising rates. The 1920s became a time of consolidation, budget-cutting and dropping of traditional party affiliation. By 1930 only 24% of Canada's dailies were partisan, 17% were \"independent\" partisan, and the majority, 50%, had become fully independent.<ref>Russell Johnston, \"Partisan Politics, Market Research, and Media Buying in Canada, 1920,\" '' Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly'' (2006) 83#4</ref>\n\n===Major papers===\n\n====Globe and Mail====\n{{main|The Globe and Mail}}\nIn 1936, the two main papers in Toronto merged: ''The Globe'' (circulation 78,000) absorbed  '' [[The Mail and Empire]]'' (circulation 118,000).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=7924708 |title=The Globe and Mail Inc.: Private Company Information \u2013 Businessweek|work=Bloomberg BusinessWeek |year=2012|accessdate=April 13, 2012}}</ref> The latter formed through the 1895 merger of two conservative newspapers, ''[[The Toronto Mail]]'' and ''[[Toronto Empire]].''

The editorial tone was conservative. Black spent massively in the first few years under editor Ken Whyte in a furious battle with the ''Globe and Mail''.

Montreal has one daily in English (''[[Montreal Gazette|The Gazette]]'') and three in French (''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'', ''[[Le Devoir]]'' and ''[[Le Journal de Montr\u00e9al]]'').

Consolidation has meant that all but one of the French-language newspapers belong to one of two media consortia.  [[Gesca]] is part of [[Power Corporation of Canada]] and controlled by the Desmarais family). The other, [[Quebecor Media]] controls most of the Quebec's television and magazine market. For a few years it was the largest chain in Canada, with 36 English language papers. Quebecor Media is a large conglomerate controlled by [[Pierre Karl P\u00e9ladeau]], who owns the controlling shares in Quebecor, that includes many community newspapers,  magazines, free newspapers, and Internet services chiefly in French. It is cutting back on newspapers to concentrate on its broadcasting, cable and wireless properties.

These are the \"Transplant Period\" from 1750\u20131800, when printing and newspapers initially came to Canada as publications of government news and proclamations; followed by the \"Partisan Period from 1800\u20131850,\" when individual printers and editors played a growing role in politics. The \"Nation Building Period from 1850\u20131900,\" when Canadian editors began the work of establishing a common nationalistic view of Canadian society. The \"Modern period\" from 1900 to 1980s saw the professionalization of the industry and the growth of chains. \"Current history\" since the 1990s saw outside interests take over the chains, as they faced new competition from the Internet.\n\n==Transplant period 1750-1800==\nThere were no printing presses; in this time, and no newspaper of any kind, under the French regime. All the newspapers in the British colonies had been transplanted from the 13 American colonies.<ref name=Fetherline />\n\nThe press in Canada was born as a tool of the government to print official government documents.  \"The discovery of such unrealized potential frightened the powers that be, who commenced a centuries-long period of harassment and intimidation in order to check what today is called the power of the press\".<ref name=Fetherline />  Information that was hostile to the government was definitely not welcome especially after the end of the [[American Revolution]] in 1783. It brought a wave of United Empire Loyalists.<ref name=Fetherline />\n\nEventually, the Canadian printers began the process of printing more than just government news and proclamations. Many of the early editors and printers were, government or influential, personalities who used their newspapers as instruments of their own political beliefs; and suffered great hardships at the hands of the government because of the oppression they faced.<ref name=Raible /> There was little local news printed, and little news from other Canadian places, since there was no system of exchanging newspapers among editors. The first advertising started to appear in the 1780s. The Quebec Gazette of 12 July 1787 had a classified ad:\n:For sale, a robust Negress, active and with good hearing, about 18 years old, who has had small-pox, has been accustomed to household duties, understands the kitchen, knows how to wash, iron, sew, and very used to caring for children. She can adapt itself equally to an English, French or German family, he speaks all three languages.<ref>W.H. Kesterton, A history of journalism in Canada. (McClelland and Stewart, 1967) p 7</ref>\n\n=== Gazettes and American transplants ===\nThis was the period that introduced print culture to British North America and began fostering a reading public. All newspapers but ''The Upper Canada Gazette'' were started by Americans. In 1783, some 60,000 Loyalists migrated after the American Revolution, with around 30,000 moving to Canada- bringing printing presses with them. All of the first newspapers started life as official government organs. They were all dependent on government patronage and printed solely information condoned by the government. In every province, there was a weekly \"Gazette\" (named after ''[[The London Gazette]]'', the English governmental organ since 1665) that carried the many notices colonial administrators wanted to circulate.<ref name=Raible />\n\nAt this time, there was no \"political sphere\", as all political news was controlled by the elite.<ref name=Raible /> In the early decades of British North America, the primary purpose of the press was to propagate official propaganda - freedom of the press was an alien idea.<ref name=Raible /> Prior to the approximate turn of the 18th into the 19th century, there was no \"public sphere\" in Canada and therefore no press in the public sphere.\n\n===First printers and publishers===\nIt was the first printers and publishers working during the turn of the century who began the slow and difficult work of creating a true, liberated press in Canada. These men faced many obstacles, including beatings, jailing, and the very serious and oft-carried out threat of being charged with criminal or seditious libel. As the early printing press was an essential tool of colonial administration, anyone who attempted to publish anything other than the government notices experienced hardships. There was a prohibition on publishing legislature proceedings which kept the writers out of the courts. These were colonial laws used by British authorities to manufacture loyalty, and the punishments were severe.<ref name=Fetherline /><ref name=Raible /> As a result, many of these brave early printers and publishers lived in fear, massive debt, and constant persecution.\n\n==== John Bushell (1715-1761) ====\n{{main|John Bushell}}\n\nBushell partnered with [[Bartholomew Green (printer, born 1699)|Bartholomew Green]] (1690\u20131751) who died before their plans were realized. Bushell relocated from Boston to Halifax and opened up a printing office, and on March 23, 1752, Bushell published the first edition of the ''[[Halifax Gazette]]'' and became the colony's first \"King's Printer\".<ref name=Raible /> He was an independent entrepreneur, given no government salary,<ref name=Fetherline /> and what government administrators thought their subjects needed and what Bushell's subscribers and advertisers wanted were not necessarily the same. He was stuck in between. The government did not trust his loyalty and so made the Provincial Secretary the editor of his paper.<ref name=Raible /> Bushell, faced with these obstacles, struggled with debt and alcoholism which eventually led to his death.<ref name=Raible />\n\n====Anton Heinrich (1734-1800)====\n{{main|Henry B. Anthony}}\n\nHeinrich learned his trade in Germany but came to America as a fifer in the British Army before relocating to Halifax and anglicizing his name to the more appropriate Henry Anthony.<ref name=Raible /> Henry acquired Bushell's enterprise, including the ''Gazette''. In October 1765 he printed an editorial in the ''Gazette'' that suggested that Nova Scotians were opposed to the [[Stamp Act]] which resulted in doubts about his loyalty, and he fled back to Massachusetts and the ''Gazette'' was shut down. Eventually, he made his way back into the government's good graces and was recommissioned to print the ''Royal Gazette''.<ref name=Dictionary />\n\n==== William Brown (1737-1789) and Thomas Gilmore (1741-1773) ====\nOriginally from Philadelphia,<ref name=Dictionary /> in 1764 the two men launched the government sponsored [[Quebec Gazette]]. The paper was bilingual and was heavily censured and scrutinized by the government.<ref name=Raible /><ref name=Dictionary />\n\n====Fleury Mesplet (1734-1794)====\n{{main|Fleury Mesplet}}\nImmigrated to Montreal from France with the intent of being a printer. However, he was jailed out of suspicion before printing anything due to his status as an American sympathizer and relationship with Benjamin Franklin.<ref name=Dictionary /> In 1778 he printed Canada's first entirely French newspaper, [[The Gazette (Montreal)]]. His editor, Valentin Jautard, chose articles with a radical tone and both men were imprisoned. In 1782, Mesplet was released and allowed to go back to work for the government because he was the only capable printer, though he technically remained imprisoned.<ref name=Raible />\n\n====Louis Roy (1771-1799)====\nOn April 18, 1793, Roy launched the ''Upper Canada Gazette'', which continued until 1849. In 1797, Roy left the paper due to political persecution after printing some incendiary opinions and fled to New York.<ref name=Dictionary />\n\n==Partisan period (1800-1850)==\n\nThis is the period in which the printers and publishers began to see success in their efforts to free the press from its government control. The papers were organs of political parties and editors often played major roles in local politics.The discussion and debate surrounding the \"public sphere\" in the North Atlantic was actively undertaken in Upper Canada and partisan newspapers of the 1800s became \"pure\" inhabitants of the public sphere.<ref name=Fetherline /> Big steps were taken towards the democratization of the press, and in 1891, the right to report on political proceedings was finally won.<ref name=Fetherline /> The papers of this period were non-deferential, and demanded democratization of information. They undermined finally began to undermine the traditional hierarchical societal structure.<ref>James John Talman, \"The Newspapers of Upper Canada a Century Ago.\" ''Canadian Historical Review'' 19#1 (1938): 9-23.</ref>\n\n===Printers and publishers===\nThe development of the public sphere in Canada was closely linked with the development of a free press and there are many parallels. Most of the early publishers were - or became - very active politicians up to the mid-1800s.\nAt this time, there was a growing market for political debate, and the independent printers of this period began using their columns for opinions, to challenge policies, expose government errors, and even promote certain candidates. These men were large personalities, unafraid to strongly voice unpopular opinions. As a result, the newspapers often became a forum for debate between the disagreeing printers.\n\nThe political issue most often debated was that of [[responsible government]]. In responsible government the executive branch is responsible to the elected legislature and no laws can be passed without the approval of said legislature. However, in Upper Canada, the appointed executive remained responsible only to the colonial governor who had to answer to Britain until 1855. Many of the publisher and printer/politicians of this time were debating this key issue.\n\nDuring this period the printers were still working under very difficult conditions. Like the printers before them, many of the printers and publishers were still plagued by debt and had to work tirelessly to earn enough to support their political careers and keep the newspapers running. These men continued the difficult work of liberating the Canadian press and it is in the stories of these men that we start to see some success along with the difficulty.\n[[Image:Le Canadien Nov 22, 1806.jpg|275px|thumb|border|''Le Canadien'', November 22, 1806, vol. 1, no 1.]]\n\n====Le Canadien====\n\"[[Le Canadien]]\" was a French weekly newspaper  published in [[Lower Canada]] from November 22, 1806 to March 14, 1810. Its motto was: ''\"Nos institutions, notre langue et nos droits\"'' (Our institutions, our language, our rights).  It was the political mouthpiece of the [[Parti canadien]], the voice of the liberal elite and merchants.  It repeatedly editorialized for responsible government, and spoke out in a defense of the Canadiens and their traditions against the British rulers, while professing loyalty to the king. In 1810 Governor [[James Henry Craig|James Craig]] had the editor [[Pierre B\u00e9dard]] and his colleagues at the paper arrested and imprisoned without trial for the criticism they published.  The paper was reestablished in the 1830s under [[\u00c9tienne Parent]], who was imprisoned for advocating responsible government in 1839.  During the rebellion era, it criticized the Durham report, opposed the union with Upper Canada, and supported the Lafontaine ministry.  It was a mainstay of Liberalism until it closed at the end of the century.<ref>Louis-Georges Harvey,  \"Canadien, Le,\" ''Oxford Companion to Canadian History'' (2006)  p 111</ref>\n\n====Gideon and Sylvester Tiffany====\nThese brothers started as official government printers in the 1790s, but refused to print only government sanctioned news and instead printed news from America. When they refused to heed warnings from the government, they were more formally persecuted. In April 1797, Gideon was charged with blasphemy, fired, fined, and jailed. Sylvester was then also charged with \"treasonable and seditious conduct\". In his defense he declared that \"As the people's printer, it is my duty to devote my head, heart and hands to their service...The interests of the King and people are inseparable\".<ref name=Raible /> Eventually the brothers were forced to give up printing, through Sylvester attempted a number of other papers before moving to New York.\n\n====Titus Geer Simons====\nSimmons was appointed as the new King's printer following the legal persecution of the Tiffany brothers, though he was not officially trained in printing. The Tiffany brothers remained on, and continued to determine much of the paper's content until 1799.<ref name=Dictionary />\n\n====William Lyon Mackenzie====\n{{main|William Lyon Mackenzie|Colonial Advocate}}\n\nMackenzie was a great influence for political development in [[Upper Canada]] (Ontario) and a fierce advocate for '''responsible government'''. In 1824, he founded the ''Colonial Advocate'', which was the first independent paper in the province to have significant political impact.<ref name=Raible /><ref name=\"Colonial Advocate\"/> Mackenzie viewed the colonial administration as incompetent, ineffective, and expensive, and he used the ''Advocate'' to publicize these opinions. Though the paper became the most widely circulated paper, it was not profitable for Mackenzie and he struggled with debt for many years. In 1826 his printing office was broken into and destroyed by a mob. When MacKenzie sued the assailants, he won his case and collected enough in damages to repair the press and pay off his debts, as well as gain public sympathy.<ref name=Dictionary />  Mackenzie is a prime example of an editor who used his printing as a tool to take on the troubled politics of the time and open the door for the newspaper to enter the public sphere.<ref>David Flint, ''William Lyon Mackenzie, Rebel Against Authority'' (Oxford University Press, 1971)</ref>\n\n====Joseph Howe====\n{{main|Joseph Howe}}\n[[Image:Joe Howe1.JPG|thumb|right|275px|Howe's slogan displayed on the ''ChronicleHerald'' building in downtown Halifax.]]\n\nIn 1828, Joseph Howe took over Halifax's ''Weekly Chronicle'', renaming it the ''Acadian''. He then also purchased the ''[[Novascotian]]''. His aggressive journalism made him the voice of Nova Scotia.  Originally he was very loyal to the British government, But his growing trust ration shifted his loyalties to Nova Scotia. Howe, like MacKenzie, demanded home rule in the name of \"responsible government\".<ref>Lorna Inness, \"Joseph Howe: Journalist.,\" ''Nova Scotia Historical Quarterly'' (1973) 3#3  pp 159-170.</ref>\n\nIn 1835, Howe was prosecuted for criminal libel for one of his articles. He spoke in argument for a free press at his trial and though he was technically guilty according to the law, the jury was quick to acquit. His success during his trial made him a local hero in Nova Scotia. It was this success that took Howe into the provincial parliament, and he eventually became a provincial premier.<ref>J. Murray Beck, ''Joseph Howe: Conservative Reformer 1804\u20131848'' (v.1 (1982)</ref>\n\n====Henry David Winton (1793-1855)====\nWinton arrived in Newfoundland on August 28, 1818. In 1820, he founded the ''Public Ledger and Newfoundland General Advisor'', the fourth newspaper in St. John's. Winton used the paper to publish his own political ideas staunchly in support of responsible government. Because of his strong political sentiments he eventually became the enemy of Catholics as well as those in favor of reform - to the extent that some people wished him harm. On May 19, 1835, Winton was attacked by a group of unknown assailants and his ears were cut off. Despite this and further similar threats, Winton continued to write in opposition of the reform government until his death.<ref name=Dictionary />\n\n====John Ryan (1761-1847) and William Lewis====\nRyan was an American expatriate who, in 1807 and with the help of William Lewis, published the first issue of the ''Royal St. John's Gazette'', the earliest newspaper in Newfoundland. Ryan soon began exposing government favoritism and unfairness in the Gazette, much to the chagrin of officials. In March 1784, both men were indicted for libel.<ref name=Dictionary />\n\n====Joseph Willcocks (1773-1814)====\n{{main|Joseph Willcocks}}\nIn 1806, Willcocks moved to Niagara where he began publishing the ''Upper Canada Guardian; or Freeman's Journal'' which he used as a vehicle for his political opinions and criticisms. That same year, he was jailed for contempt of the house.\nin 1808, he rejoined politics officially and became Canada's first true leader of the Opposition against those aligned with the colonial government. He stopped printing his journal in 1812. In July 1813, he offered his services to the Americans while holding a seat in the Legislative Assembly and was formally charged with treason in 1814.<ref name=Dictionary />\n\n== Nation-building and myth-making period (1850-1900) ==\n[[File:The Evening Star Montreal 1869.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The Montreal ''Evening Star'' in 1869]]\nEditors were now free from direct governmental control. However, the government continued to influence them in other underhanded ways, such as privately persuading editorial content and putting paid advertising only into assenting newspapers.<ref name=Raible /> For the most part, the radical newspapers of the Public Sphere Period had served their purposes and the papers of this period were somewhat more unbiased. More than ever, technology and progress were of great importance.\n\nThe papers of this time took on the role of establishing the Canadian identity. In publications of this period, there was a celebration of conformity and orthodoxy. Unlike the incendiary publications of the past, there was no justification seen for the rejection of order.<ref name=Fetherline />\n\n===Printers and publishers===\nDuring this period, largely free from the government restrictions of the past, that the printers and publishers took on the role of establishing the Canadian identity. As before, many of them were personally involved in politics as well and continued to use their papers to exert their political sentiments and to push for progress and change.\n\n====George Brown (1818-1880)====\n<!-- [[File:Canada_Stamp_-_George_Brown.jpg|thumb|none]] -->\n[[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]]  (1818\u20131880) and his father immigrated to Toronto from Scotland in 1837; in 1843 they founded the \"Banner,\" a Presbyterian weekly supporting Free Kirk principles and political reform. In 1844, Brown founded [[The Globe and Mail]], a paper with strong political ambitions. Brown bought out many competitors and increased circulation using advanced technology. By 1860 it was Canada's largest newspaper.  In the 1850s, Brown entered politics and became the Reform Party leader and eventually reached an agreement that led to the Confederation and the founding of the Dominion of Canada. Afterwards, he resigned from Parliament, but continued to promote his political views in the \"Globe\".  Brown fought endless battles with the typographical union from 1843 to 1872. He paid union wages not because of generosity but only when the power of the union forced it upon him. In 1880 he was killed by an angry ex-employee.<ref <ref>Sally Zerker, \"George Brown and the Printers Union,\" ''Journal of Canadian Studies'' (1975) 10#1 pp 42-48.</ref>\n\n====Modeste Demers (1809-1871)====\nIn Victoria in 1856, Bishop Modeste Demers imported a hand press intending to publish religious materials. It remained unused until 1858, when the American printer Frederick Marriott used the \"Demers press\" to publish four different British Columbia newspapers, the most influential of which was the ''British Colonist''. The Demers press continued to be used for printing until 1908.<ref name=Dictionary />\n\n====Amor De Cosmos (1825-1897)====\n{{main|Amor De Cosmos}}\n\nAmor De Cosmos was the founder of the \"British Colonist\".  He was well known for using its pages to express his political opinions.\nDe Cosmos also eventually entered politics, assumed leadership, urged political reform and pushed for \"responsible government''. He was elected to represent Victoria in the House of Commons while at the same time serving as the provincial premiere of British Columbia.\nHe was outspoken and eccentric, and made quite a few enemies throughout his life. He was accused of a scandal with the unions which eventually forced him to leave politics. When he died he had fallen into a complete breakdown.<ref name=Raible /><ref name=Dictionary />\n\n==Modern period from 1900 to 1980s==\n\n===Changing economics===\nStarting in the 1870s, new aggressive publishers included [[Hugh Graham, 1st Baron Atholstan|Hugh Graham]] at the ''[[Montreal Star]]'', and [[John Ross Robertson]] at the ''[[Toronto Telegram]]'', the voice of working-class Orange Protestantism. They adapted the model of the American penny press and sold cheap newspapers with a strong partisan slant and an emphasis on local news of crime, scandal, and corruption. Entertainment news became increasingly prominent, especially the comings and goings of celebrities. Sports gained increasing attention as the readers followed the ups and downs of their local teams. New features were added to attract women, including articles on fashions, grooming, and recipes. The new technology made printing cheaper and faster, and encouraged multiple editions that provided updated news throughout the day in the major cities.  The ''Montreal Star''  by 1899, sold 52,600 copies a day, and by 1913 40% of its circulation was outside of Montreal. It dominated the English-language market.\n\nIn 1900, most Canadian newspapers were local affairs, designed primarily to inform local partisans about the provincial and national political scene. The publishers depended on loyal partisan subscribers, as well as  contracts for public printing  controlled by the political parties. Objectivity was not the goal, as the editors and reporters endeavored to reinforce the partisan  attitudes on major public questions.<ref>Paul  Rutherford, ''A Victorian authority: the daily press in late nineteenth-century Canada'' (1982)</ref>\n\nIn the 1910s, the newspaper industry consolidated as dailies closed, chains formed, and rivals cooperated through press associations and news services. A key factor was advertising--the larger the audience the better, but partisanship reduced potential circulation to members of only one party. In the 19th century  advertisers used papers that shared their political leanings.  But now national advertising agencies adopted new media buying practices. They became nonpartisan and favoured papers with the highest circulation.  The companies placing ads wanted to reach the maximum possible audience regardless of partisanship. The result was a series of consolidations yielding much larger, largely nonpartisan newspapers, which depended more heavily on advertising revenue than on subscriptions from loyal party members. By 1900, three-fourths of the revenue of Toronto newspapers came from advertising. About two thirds of the newspapers' editorial pages loyally supported either the Conservative or the Liberal party, while the remainder were more independent. Regardless of the editorial page, the news pages increasingly prioritized objectivity and bipartisanship. The publishers were focused on advertising revenues that were proportionate to overall circulation. A newspaper that appealed only to one party cut its potential audience in half. Simultaneously, the rapid growth of industry in Ontario and Quebec, coupled with the rapid settlement of the prairies, produced a large more affluent newspaper-reading population. The result was a golden age for Canadian newspapers peaking about 1911.  Many papers failed during the war era. Advertising agencies in 1915 gained a major advantage with the arrival of the [[Audit Bureau of Circulations]], which for the first-time provided reliable data on circulation, as opposed to the partisan boasting and exaggeration that had been the norm. the agencies now had a stronger hand in bargaining for lower advertising rates. The 1920s became a time of consolidation, budget-cutting and dropping of traditional party affiliation. By 1930 only 24% of Canada's dailies were partisan, 17% were \"independent\" partisan, and the majority, 50%, had become fully independent.<ref>Russell Johnston, \"Partisan Politics, Market Research, and Media Buying in Canada, 1920,\" '' Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly'' (2006) 83#4</ref>\n\n===Major papers===\n\n====Globe and Mail====\n{{main|The Globe and Mail}}\nIn 1936, the two main papers in Toronto merged: ''The Globe'' (circulation 78,000) absorbed  '' [[The Mail and Empire]]'' (circulation 118,000).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=7924708 |title=The Globe and Mail Inc.: Private Company Information \u2013 Businessweek|work=Bloomberg BusinessWeek |year=2012|accessdate=April 13, 2012}}</ref> The latter formed through the 1895 merger of two conservative newspapers, ''[[The Toronto Mail]]'' and ''[[Toronto Empire]].''

Few changes were made in editorial or news policy.

In 1970 the Special Senate Committee on the Mass Media, or the Davey Committee warned against consolidation. Its recommendations were ignored, and consolidation continued.

The decline in newspaper advertising revenue was worldwide, and caused by the shift from paper media and television into Internet advertising in Canada, newspaper advertising revenue fell from a high of $2.6 billion Steadily down to $1.9 billion in 2011, with no end in sight.  Circulation fell steadily as well.  The newspaper chains reduced production costs  cut the number of pages, and dropped traditional features, such as detailed stock market reports.  They set up paywalls in order to charge for Internet access.<ref>Chris Powell, \"Cutting costs, building walls.\" ''Marketing'' (Nov 19, 2012) Supplement, p 11</ref><ref>.Ga\u00ebtan Tremblay, \"iPublish or perish: challenges facing the Qu\u00e9bec press in the digital age,\" ''Media, Culture & Society'' (Jan 2015) 37#1 pp 144-151.</ref> A 2019 Report conducted by the [[Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism]]; found out that only 9% of Canadian pays for any proportion online news in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalnewsreport.org/survey/2019/overview-key-findings-2019/|title=Executive Summary and Key Findings of the 2019 Report|website=Digital News Report|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref>\n\n===''The National Post''===\n[[Conrad Black]] launched his national newspaper chain [[Hollinger International]] in the 1990s by purchasing the Southam Newspapers, that included the ''Ottawa Citizen,'' ''Montreal Gazette,'' ''Edmonton Journal,'' ''Calgary Herald,'' and ''Vancouver Sun.'' For a brief time Hollinger owned almost 60 per cent of Canada's daily newspapers. Black transformed a Toronto business paper into the ''[[National Post]]'' as his flagship title.  The editorial tone was conservative. Black spent massively in the first few years under editor Ken Whyte in a furious battle with the ''Globe and Mail''.  ''Maclean's'' says \"The National Post not only shook up Canada's media establishment, it expanded the country's political conversation, providing a diversity of opinion on a wide range of public issues. The Post has given readers 10 years of insight, humour, and most of all, choice in the market for daily news.\"<ref>\"Seven Days,\" ''Maclean's,'' (Nov 10, 2008)</ref>\n\nBlack sold the ''National Post'' to CanWest Global in 2000-01.  By 2006 the ''National Post'' cut back sharply on its national distribution system in an effort to cut costs and stay alive.  By 2008 ''Globe and Mail'' and ''National Post'' had a combined circulation nationwide of 3.4 million.<ref>''Marketing Magazine'' (Sept. 15, 2008) Supplement, p 4</ref>\n\n===CanWest===\nThe emblematic network was [[CanWest]] until it collapsed in 2009.  It was founded by a Manitoba tax lawyer, journalist, and politician [[Izzy Asper]] (1932-2003), who started with a local TV station in 1975 and built the nation's largest publisher of newspapers, with ''[[The National Post]]'' as its flagship.  CanWest bought out the Southam chain.  It owned the [[Global network]] and [[E! (Canadian TV system)|E! television]], as well as the Alliance Atlantis group of specialty channels. At its peak in the early 21st century it owned the Canada.com Internet portal, and had television and radio interests in Australia and Turkey.<ref>Marc Edge, ''Asper Nation: Canada's Most Dangerous Media Company'' (Vancouver: New Star Books 2007)</ref>  CanWest went bankrupt in 2009, and the newspapers were taken over by [[Postmedia Network]], while the broadcasting assets were sold separately to [[Shaw Communications]].\n\n===Quebec newspapers===\nQuebec has always been a largely separate newspaper world.  Montreal has one daily in English (''[[Montreal Gazette|The Gazette]]'') and three in French (''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'', ''[[Le Devoir]]'' and ''[[Le Journal de Montr\u00e9al]]''). In Qu\u00e9bec City, there are two daily newspapers, ''[[Le Soleil (Quebec)|Le Soleil]]'' and ''[[Le Journal de Qu\u00e9bec]]''.  Outside Quebec's main cities, ''[[The Record (Sherbrooke)|The Record]]'' (Sherbrooke) is English-language; five publish in French: ''[[Le Droit]]'' (Gatineau/Ottawa); ''[[Le Nouvelliste (Quebec)|Le Nouvelliste]]'' (Trois-Rivi\u00e8res), ''[[Le Quotidien (Saguenay)|Le Quotidien]]'' (Saguenay), ''[[La Tribune (Sherbrooke)|La Tribune]]'' (Sherbrooke) and ''[[La Voix de l'Est (Granby)|La Voix de l'Est]]'' (Granby).  Consolidation has meant that all but one of the French-language newspapers belong to one of two media consortia.  [[Gesca]] is part of [[Power Corporation of Canada]] and controlled by the Desmarais family). The other, [[Quebecor Media]] controls most of the Quebec's television and magazine market. For a few years it was the largest chain in Canada, with 36 English language papers. Quebecor Media is a large conglomerate controlled by [[Pierre Karl P\u00e9ladeau]], who owns the controlling shares in Quebecor, that includes many community newspapers,  magazines, free newspapers, and Internet services chiefly in French. It is cutting back on newspapers to concentrate on its broadcasting, cable and wireless properties. In 2013 it sold off 74 Quebec weeklies to [[Transcontinental (company)|Transcontinental Inc.]] for $75 million. In late 2014, Quebecor sold its 175 Sun Media English language newspapers, and many websites, to the Canadian group [[Postmedia Network]] for $316 million.  Postmedia now owns all the dailies in Edmonton, Calgary and Ottawa.<ref>Martin Patriquin, \"Newspaper kershuffle,.\" ''Maclean's'' (Oct 20, 2014)</ref>  [[Gesca]] since 2013 has responded to the Internet challenge by expanding its free on-line services, which it supports through advertising.<ref>Ga\u00ebtan Tremblay, \"iPublish or perish: challenges facing the Qu\u00e9bec press in the digital age,\" ''Media, Culture & Society'' (Jan 2015) 37#1 pp 144-151.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Journalism|Canada}}\n* [[Canadian Newspaper Association]]\n* [[History of free speech in Canada]]\n* [[List of defunct newspapers of Quebec]] (historical)\n* [[List of early Canadian newspapers]] (historical)\n* [[List of newspapers in Canada]] (modern)\n* [[List of newspapers in Canada by circulation]] (modern)\n* [[List of Quebec media]]\n* [[Mass media in Canada]]\n\n===Editors, publishers and personalities===\n* [[Izzy Asper]] (1932-2003), conglomerator\n* [[John Wilson Bengough]], (1851-1923) cartoonist\n* [[Joan Fraser]] (b. 1944) <ref name=Senate>{{cite web|title=Senator Joan Fraser&nbsp;\u2014 Liberal Party of Canada|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/SenatorsMembers/Senate/SenatorsBiography/isenator_det.asp?Language=E&M=M&senator_id=142&sortord=N|publisher=[[Senate of Canada]]|accessdate=17 October 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet]]\n* [[Norman Webster]] (b. 1941) <ref name=\"Webster-Maclean's\">{{cite web|last=Wells|first=Paul|title=The last two paragraphs of Norman Webster's May 29 Montreal Gazette column|url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2009/06/08/the-last-two-paragraphs-of-norman-websters-may-29-montreal-gazette-column/|publisher=[[Maclean's]]|accessdate=17 October 2013|date=2009-06-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019144837/http://www2.macleans.ca/2009/06/08/the-last-two-paragraphs-of-norman-websters-may-29-montreal-gazette-column/|archive-date=19 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Montreal newspapers===\n* ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]''\n* ''[[La Presse (Canada)|La Presse]]''\n* ''[[Le Devoir]]''\n* ''[[Le Journal de Montr\u00e9al]]''\n\n===Toronto newspapers===\n* ''[[Toronto Standard]]'', 2010 to present (online)\n* ''[[Toronto Star]]'', 1899 to present\n* ''[[Toronto Sun]]'', 1971 to present\n* ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', 1936 to present\n** ''[[The Globe (Toronto newspaper)|The Globe]]'', 1844-1936\n** ''[[The Mail and Empire]]'', 1895-1936\n*** ''[[The Toronto Mail]]'', 1872-1895\n*** ''[[Toronto Empire]]'', 1872-1895\n\n==References==\n{{reflist\n|refs=\n<ref name=Fetherline>{{cite book|last=Fetherling|first=Douglas|title=The Rise of the Canadian Newspaper|year=1949|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Toronto}}</ref>\n<ref name=Raible>{{cite book|last=Raible|first=Chris|title=The Power of the Press: The Story of Early Canadian Printers and Publishers|year=2007|publisher=James Lorimer & Company LTD|location=Toronto}}</ref>\n<ref name=Dictionary>{{cite web|last=English|first=John|title=Dictionary of Canadian Biography|url=http://www.biographi.ca/index-e.html}}</ref><ref name=\"Colonial Advocate\">{{cite news|last=Mackenzie|first=William Lyon|newspaper=The Colonial Advocate|date=January 26, 1832}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Allen, Gene.
