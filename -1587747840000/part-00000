While it can refer to two people independently romantically linked with a third, it usually implies that each of the three people has some kind of relationship to the other two. \nThe 1994 book ''Beliefs, Reasoning, and Decision Making'' states, \"Although the romantic love triangle is formally identical to the friendship triad, as many have noted their actual implications are quite different....Romantic love is typically viewed as an exclusive relationship, whereas friendship is not.\"<ref>R.

One person typically ends up feeling betrayed at some point (e.g., \"Person A is [[Jealousy|jealous]] of Person C who is having a relationship with Person B who, in Person A's eyes, is 'his/her' person.\").<ref>David Cooper, ''The Death of the Family'' (Penguin 1974) p. 49</ref> A similar arrangement that is agreed upon by all parties is sometimes called a [[triad (relationship)|triad]], which is a type of ''[[polyamory]]'' even though polyamory usually implies sexual relations. Within the context of [[monogamy]], love triangles are inherently unstable, with [[unrequited love]] and jealousy as common themes. In most cases, the jealous or rejected first party ends a friendship\u2014and sometimes even starts a fight with\u2014the second party over the third-party love interest. Though rare, love triangles have been known to lead to [[murder]] or [[suicide]] committed by the actual or perceived rejected lover.\n\n[[Psychoanalysis]] has explored \"the theme of erotic love triangles and their roots in the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal]] triangle\".<ref name=\"auto\">Johnson, p. 6</ref> Experience suggests that \"a repeated pattern of forming or being caught in love triangle can be much dissolved by beginning to analyse the patterns of the childhood relationship to each parent in turn and to both parents as a couple\".<ref name=\"auto\"/> In such instances, \"you find men who are attracted only by married woman but who can't sustain the relationship if it threatens to become more than an affair.

Alternatively, the hero or heroine has a choice between a seemingly perfect lover and an imperfect but endearing person.  In this case, the \"too-good-to-be-true\" person is often revealed to have a significant flaw, such as hidden insensitivity or [[lechery|lecherousness]], causing the other person to become the more desirable partner.\n\n===Eternal triangle===\n{{Other uses|Eternal triangle (disambiguation)}}\n\"In geometric terms, the eternal triangle can be represented as comprising three points \u2013 a jealous mate (A) in a relationship with an unfaithful partner (B) who has a lover (C)...A feels ''abandoned'', B is ''between'' two mates, and C is a ''catalyst'' for crisis in the union A-B\".<ref>Pam/Pearson, p. 148</ref>\n\nIt has been suggested that \"a collusive network is always needed to keep the triangle eternal\".<ref name=\"auto1\">Pam/Pearson, p. 166</ref> This may take a tragic form \u2013 \"I saw no prospect of its ending except with death \u2013 the death of one of three people\"<ref>Rose Macaulay, ''The Towers of Trebizond'' (1990) p. 66</ref> \u2013 or alternately a comic one: \"A man at the funeral of a friend's wife, with whom he has been carrying on an affair, breaks into tears and finally becomes hysterical, while the husband remains impassive.

Copeland ed., ''Woman Critiqued'' (2006) p. 228</ref> [[Ren\u00e9 Girard]] has explored the role of envy and [[mimetic desire]] in such relationships, arguing that often the situation \"subordinates a desired ''something'' to the ''someone'' who enjoys a privileged relationship with it\".<ref>Ren\u00e9 Girard, ''A Theatre of Envy'', (Oxford 1991) p. 4.</ref> In such cases, 'it cannot be fair to blame the quarrel of the mimetic twins on a woman....She is their common scapegoat'.<ref>Girard, p. 323-4</ref>\n\n===Marital breakup===\nWhen a love triangle results in the breakup of a marriage, it may often be followed by what has been called \"the imposition of a 'defilement taboo'...the emotional demand imposed by a jealous ex-mate...to eschew any friendly or supportive contact with the rival in the triangle\".<ref>Pam/Pearson, p. 168</ref> The result is often to leave children gripped by \"shadows from the past...they often take sides.

Because of its dramatic qualities, LYAHF is the basis of much of the world's literature, both good and bad\".<ref>Eric Berne, ''Games People Play'' (Penguin), p. 108.</ref>\n\n[[Young adult literature]] has seen a rise in the popularity of the love triangle story structure (such as ''[[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]]'' or ''[[The Selection]]''). But the love triangle story structure has been around since before early classic writers like [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Alexandre Dumas]]. Shakespeare's famous play ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' featured a love triangle between Juliet, Romeo, and Paris. Although more subtle, Dumas's classics ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' and ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' also feature love triangles strong enough to seek revenge and start a war.\n\nLove triangles can either be relatively balanced, in which the two candidates each have a fair chance of ending up with the protagonist, or they can be lopsided, in which the hero or heroine has an obvious romantic interest in one of the candidates, and considers the other candidate as \"[[platonic love|just a friend]]\", but withholds a confession to avoid hurting feelings. An example of this is in the Broadway hit musical ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'', in which dim-witted Fiyero first displays affection for [[Glinda the Good Witch]], but then falls for [[Elphaba]], the supposedly [[Wicked Witch of the West|Wicked Witch]]. But in this latter case, to provide necessary tension and drama, the second platonic candidate is also very often the hero or heroine's long-term [[boyfriend]] or [[girlfriend]].{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nA less permanent love triangle occurs when a former lover of the main character makes an unexpected appearance to win back the character's heart, provoking feelings of jealousy from the main character's steady partner.  However, this situation is usually not considered an actual love triangle since there is little possibility of the main character breaking up with a longtime partner to pursue a just-introduced character, and it is often used as only a test of the true depth of the main character's devotion to their partner.  In these cases, the long-term partner has usually been guilty of neglect toward the main character and in the end the relationship remains intact with the long-term partner having learned some valuable lesson.\n\n===Television===\nUsually, a love triangle will end with the hero or heroine confiding their feelings in the suitor they feel is most virtuous or has the most interest in them. (As in ''[[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]]''.) The other suitor usually steps aside to allow the couple to be happy, or comes to terms with their feelings, often claiming they could not love the main character as much.  Sometimes they are written out of the love equation entirely by falling in love with someone else, or being killed off or otherwise eliminated.  While love triangles can be accused of being [[clich\u00e9d]], if done well, they provide insight into the complexity of love and what is best to pursue in a romantic relationship.\n\nIn television shows, a love triangle is often prolonged, delaying final declarations of love between the pursued character and suitors that may prematurely end this dynamic or displease fans. Some examples of these include ''[[90210 (TV series)|90210]]'', ''[[Friends]]'', ''[[The O.C.]]'', ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'', ''[[The Vampire Diaries]]'' and ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]''. Love triangles also featured prominently on [[soap operas]], and can span more than a decade, as famously shown by [[Taylor Hamilton]], [[Ridge Forrester]] and [[Brooke Logan]] on ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]''. Another famous soap opera love triangle was the one that occurred on ''[[General Hospital]]'' between [[Luke Spencer]], [[Laura Spencer (General Hospital)|Laura Spencer]], and [[Scotty Baldwin]]. Similarly, [[romance film]]s also sustain this set-up until near the film's end, although they tend to establish a more clear-cut conclusion to the romantic entanglements than in long-running TV shows.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n===Popular music===\nThe love triangle has been a recurring subject in many popular songs through the years.

M\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois is French and directly translates to \"household for three\" meaning it is usually composed of a \"married couple and a lover...who live together while sharing sexual relations\". This differs from a love triangle because each participant is equally motivated purely by sexual desires.  The m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois may be considered a subset of 'The Sandwich...a straight three-handed operation...which may be operated with any assortment of sexes: three men, three women, two men and a woman (\"''M\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois''\"), or two women and a man (\"The Tourist Sandwich\")'.<ref>Eric Berne, ''Sex in Human Loving'' (1970) p. 173</ref>\n\nThere is also the possibility of 'a ''m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois'' powered by the passion of hatred'.<ref>Belinda Sterling, ''The Journal of Dora Damage'' (London 2007) p. 190</ref>{{elaboration needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Psychology}}\n* [[Adultery]]\n* [[Affair]]\n* [[Tennessee Waltz]]\n* [[Threesome]]\n* [[Triangulation (psychology)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wiktionary|eternal triangle}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080515053238/http://www.lovecoachblog.com/lovetrianglesurvival/ How to Cope in a Love Triangle]\n\n[[Category:Love|Triangle]]\n[[Category:Narrative techniques]]\n[[Category:Sexual fidelity]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Romantic relationship involving three people}}\n{{Distinguish|Triangular theory of love|M\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois}}\n{{Other uses|Love triangle (disambiguation)}}\n{{Love sidebar|types}}\nA '''love triangle''' (also called a '''romantic love triangle''' or a '''romance triangle''' or an '''eternal triangle''') is usually a [[Intimate relationship|romantic relationship]] involving three or more people.

Love triangles also featured prominently on [[soap operas]], and can span more than a decade, as famously shown by [[Taylor Hamilton]], [[Ridge Forrester]] and [[Brooke Logan]] on ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]''. Another famous soap opera love triangle was the one that occurred on ''[[General Hospital]]'' between [[Luke Spencer]], [[Laura Spencer (General Hospital)|Laura Spencer]], and [[Scotty Baldwin]]. Similarly, [[romance film]]s also sustain this set-up until near the film's end, although they tend to establish a more clear-cut conclusion to the romantic entanglements than in long-running TV shows.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n===Popular music===\nThe love triangle has been a recurring subject in many popular songs through the years.

(London 2002) p. 55</ref>\n\n==Real life==\n*The [[Bloomsbury Group]] often produced some unusual forms of love triangles, as with that involving [[Vanessa Bell]], [[Duncan Grant]] and the latter's lover, [[David Garnett]].<ref>Hermione Lee, ''Virginia Woolf'' (London 1996) p. 381 and p. 540</ref>\n*Warned of a love triangle by one of his prospective partners, [[Einstein]] conceded to her that \"You have more respect for the difficulties of triangular geometry than I, old mathematicus, have.\"<ref>Quoted in W. Isaacson, ''Einstein'' (2007) p. 361</ref>\n\n==Related terms==\n\n===M\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois===\nA love triangle should not be confused with a [[m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois]], a three-way relationship in which either all members are romantically involved with each other, or one member has relations with two others who are reconciled to the situation instead of being in conflict. M\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois is French and directly translates to \"household for three\" meaning it is usually composed of a \"married couple and a lover...who live together while sharing sexual relations\". This differs from a love triangle because each participant is equally motivated purely by sexual desires.  The m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois may be considered a subset of 'The Sandwich...a straight three-handed operation...which may be operated with any assortment of sexes: three men, three women, two men and a woman (\"''M\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois''\"), or two women and a man (\"The Tourist Sandwich\")'.<ref>Eric Berne, ''Sex in Human Loving'' (1970) p. 173</ref>\n\nThere is also the possibility of 'a ''m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois'' powered by the passion of hatred'.<ref>Belinda Sterling, ''The Journal of Dora Damage'' (London 2007) p. 190</ref>{{elaboration needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Psychology}}\n* [[Adultery]]\n* [[Affair]]\n* [[Tennessee Waltz]]\n* [[Threesome]]\n* [[Triangulation (psychology)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wiktionary|eternal triangle}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080515053238/http://www.lovecoachblog.com/lovetrianglesurvival/ How to Cope in a Love Triangle]\n\n[[Category:Love|Triangle]]\n[[Category:Narrative techniques]]\n[[Category:Sexual fidelity]]\n", "name_user": "73.144.218.101", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_triangle"}

It was written in [[1942 in music|1942]] for the [[Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra]] under [[conducting|conductor]] [[Eugene Aynsley Goossens|Eugene Goossens]] and was inspired in part by a speech made earlier that year by then [[American Vice President]] [[Henry A. Wallace]], in which  Wallace proclaimed the dawning of the \"Century of the Common Man\".\n\nSeveral alternative versions have been made and fragments of the work have appeared in many subsequent US and British cultural productions, such as in the musical scores of movies.\n\n==Instrumentation==\nA [[fanfare]] is a piece of music usually introducing an event or another piece of music.
