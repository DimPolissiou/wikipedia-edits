Garage doors are frequently large enough to accommodate [[automobile]]s and other vehicles. Small garage doors may be made in a single panel that tilts up and back across the garage ceiling. Larger doors are usually made in several jointed panels that roll up on tracks across the garage ceiling, or into a roll above the doorway. The operating mechanism is spring-loaded or counterbalanced to offset the weight of the door and reduce human or motor effort required to operate the door. Less commonly, some garage doors slide or swing horizontally. Doors are made of wood, metal, or fiberglass, and may be insulated to prevent heat loss. [[Warehouse]]s, [[bus garage]]s and [[Motive power depot|locomotive sheds]] have larger versions.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Garage door opener.jpg|right|thumb|An electric garage-door opener operates on the center track]]\nA typical version of an overhead garage door used in the past would have been built as a one-piece panel.<ref name=\"DoItRight\">{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5N78fogAH9QC&pg=PA154&lpg=PA154&dq=Old-style+swing-up+garage+doors+were+made+in+one+piece,+and+swung+upward+to+open |page=154 |title=Do it right the first time: what every homeowner needs to know before the work begins |first=Gene |last=Hamilton |first2=Katie |last2=Hamilton |publisher=Innova Publishers |year=2004 |isbn=9780974937359 |accessdate=2015-07-19}}</ref> The panel was mounted on each side with unequal parallelogram style hinge lifting mechanism.

From the closed position a single panel door swings up and overhead with a hinge on each side (known as jamb type hardware) to the fully open position. A disadvantage of monolithic panel doors is that the swing up arc of the door occurs partially outside the garage. This means a vehicle must stop and park several feet in front of the door to avoid being hit by the garage door when it is opened.\n[[File:Kipptor nicht ausschwingendes einteiliges Tor.gif|thumb|one piece track type hardware]]\nSingle panel doors can also be installed with (one piece track type hardware) that folds the door back with a single horizontal track on each side (which is mounted at the top of the wood frame) and a roller, (mounted to the top of the door on each side. A hinge on each side that attaches to the bottom of each side of garage door. Using track hardware, a car can be parked much closer to the door, as the whole door, when in the open position, rests completely inside of the garage door header. Track type hardware has much less arc when raising and lowering the garage door as opposed jamb type hardware.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Sectional garage doors==\n[[File:Garage door in Riyadh,Saudi Arabia.jpg|right|thumb|Sectional garage door panel being installed]]\nSectional doors are usually constructed of three to eight panels and slide up and overhead. Sectional doors occupy exactly the same amount of internal garage space as a monolithic door. Sectional doors have two advantages over single panel monolithic doors:\n* Sectional doors do not require any space outside the garage to open. A vehicle may park very close to the garage before opening the door.\n* Each panel of a sectional door has its own connection to the door track. This increases reliability and robustness compared to monolithic doors, which have only a few track connections for the whole panel.\n\nGarage doors can be made out of many materials, but [[steel]], aluminum, [[wood]], copper, glass, and [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] ([[polyethylene]]) are the most popular materials. Some manufacturers incorporate foamed-in-place polyurethane insulation within the monolithic panel and sectional garage doors.\n\nThe side sliding sectional door<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATLMwqBYlSY \"Side Sliding garage Door\"] PRIMO TIM 2014</ref>\n* A lot of space under the garage ceiling.\n* Can use the entire ceiling of the garage.\n* Fast access to the garage\n\n==Roller doors==\n[[File:Crown gears on roller-door at Ngcobo.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Detail of roller door mechanism]]\nRoller doors (sometimes called \"sheet doors\") are usually constructed of corrugated steel. They evolved from cover window and door coverings.<ref name=\"amazines.com\"/> Other materials can be used (e.g.; transparent corrugated fibreglass) where strong impact resistance is not required. Corrugations give the door strength against impacts. A typical single car garage roller door has a preloaded spring inside the rolling mechanism. The spring reduces the effort required to open the door. Larger roller doors in commercial premises are not sprung (except USA) and use a manual pulley and chain system or a geared motor to raise and lower (roll up and roll down) the door. Roller doors cannot be effectively insulated.\n\nIn the UK (and other parts of the EU), 'insulated' roller garage doors are available, using an aluminium lathe filled with [[polyurethane]] foam for thermal and acoustic insulation.\n\nThe common use of roller doors in Australian garages is discussed at ''[[Garage_(residential)#In_Australia|Garage (residential) \u00a7 In Australia]]''. \n\nIn terms of thermal insulation, the roller door has a typical insulation R-value of 4.9 to 5.2. A sheet steel garage door has a typical insulation R-value of 0.5 to 2.7.\n\nApplication that need more thermal insulation typically use foam filled sectional garage door, which provide typical insulation R-values of 6.1 to 6.4.\n\n==Garage door materials==\n* Aluminum garage doors are low-cost, light, rust-proof, and feature low-maintenance. They are prone to [[denting]] because aluminum is not strong and they are energy-inefficient since aluminum is a highly [[conductive]] material.\n* Fiberglass and vinyl garage doors are composite units, combining a steel core behind a fiberglass or vinyl skin. They have also [[polyurethane]] insulated base sections, or other type of foam insulation. These premium doors can match steel garage doors, and be a realistic imitation of wood (namely fiberglass units), but they may be more expensive than steel units.\n* Steel doors have become common and are available in a variety of sizes and styles, provide strength and security, are cost-competitive, and may have optional [[R-value (insulation)|insulating value.]] Extra strength is available with two or three layers of galvanized steel with a low [[Sheet metal gauge|gauge]] number (0.6 - 0.7&nbsp;mm steel panels).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dasma.com/pdf/publications/techdatasheets/commercialresidential/tds154.pdf |title=DASMA Metal Gauge Chart Technical Data Sheet #154 |publisher=DASMA |access-date=2015-07-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802211937/http://dasma.com/PDF/Publications/TechDataSheets/CommercialResidential/TDS154.pdf |archive-date=2014-08-02 |df= }}</ref>\n* Wood garage doors offer aesthetic appeal, but they are high-maintenance and may be expensive. Low-priced wood garage doors may warp and break easily.\n\n==Steel stamped construction==\n[[File:Sectional-type overhead garage door.JPG|thumb|Sectional-type steel with exterior cladding overhead garage doors in the style of old carriage house doors]]\n\nA common material for a new garage door is steel sheet formed or stamped to look like a raised panel wooden door. Steel doors are available in uninsulated, insulated, and double skin steel. A design mimicking [[carriage house]] doors has become popular since early 2000s, and many manufacturers clad the exterior of a steel door with composite, vinyl boards, or other trim to give it the appearance of wood.\n\n==Insulation==\nIn situations involving [[Garage (residential)|residential attached garages]] where the [[R-value (insulation)|insulating value]] and the energy efficiency of a garage door is important to prevent overheating and freezing problems, as well as for comfort and energy savings.\n\nSome manufacturers advertise very high insulating values for some of their garage doors (R-15 to R-17), but it may be true for only for some central sections. The actual R-values \u2013 for the entire door \u2013 are often 1/2 or 1/3 of the advertised value.\n\n==Torsion spring lift mechanism==\nA [[torsion spring]] counterbalance system consists of one or two tightly wound up springs on a steel shaft with [[cable drum]]s at both ends. The entire apparatus mounts on the header wall above the garage door and has three supports: a center bearing plate with a steel or nylon bearing and two end bearing plates at both ends. The springs themselves consist of the steel wire with a stationary cone at one end and a winding cone at the other end. The stationary cone is attached to the center bearing plate. The winding cone consists of holes every 90 degrees for winding the springs and two set screws to secure the springs to the shaft. Steel counterbalance cables run from the roller brackets at the bottom corners of the door to a notch in the cable drums. When the door is raised, the springs unwind and the stored tension lifts the door by turning the shaft, thus turning the cable drums, wrapping the cables around the grooves on the cable drums. When the door is lowered, the cables unwrap from the drums and the springs are rewound to full tension.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truetex.com/garage |title=Garage Door Torsion Spring Replacement |publisher=Truetex.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-04}}</ref>\n\n===Life of torsion spring===\nGarage door manufacturers typically produce garage doors fitted with torsion springs that provide a minimum of 10,000 to 15,000 cycles and are guaranteed for three to seven years. One cycle is a single opening and closing sequence. Most manufacturers offer a 30,000 cycle spring. However, it is important to remember that if the weight of the garage door is increased by adding glass, additional insulation, or even several coats of paint, the life of the torsion spring may be greatly reduced. Additionally, springs at highly humid environments, such as coastal regions tend to have a significantly shorter cycle life, due to the corrosive cracking.\n\nOther factors like poor garage door maintenance, loose tracks, or components shorten torsion spring life. Owners are advised to avoid applying grease to garage door tracks because that makes the wheels \"skate\" in the track instead of turning on their bearings. Only bearings, hinges, and spring wire require lubricant.\n\n==Extension spring lift mechanism==\nAn extension spring counterbalance system consists of a pair of stretched springs running parallel to the horizontal tracks. The springs lift the door through a system of pulleys and counterbalance cables running from the bottom corner brackets through the pulleys. When the door is raised, the springs contract, thus lifting the door as the tension is released. Typically these springs are made of 11 gauge (3&nbsp;mm) galvanized steel, and the lengths of these springs are based on the height of the garage door in question. Their lifting weight capacity can best be identified by the color that is painted on the ends of the springs.\n\n==Maintenance==\n[https://localgaragedoor.repair/ Maintenance of garage door] is described in the manufacturer's instructions and consists of periodic checks for correct operation, visual inspection of parts, and lubrication.\n<ref name=\"dasma.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dasma.com/safetygdmaint.asp |title=DASMA Door and Access Systems Manufacturers Association |publisher=Dasma.com |date=1993-01-01 |access-date=2012-11-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028213832/http://www.dasma.com/SafetyGDMaint.asp |archive-date=2012-10-28 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dasma.com/safetygdoors.asp |title=DASMA Door and Access Systems Manufacturers Association |publisher=Dasma.com |accessdate=2012-11-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826054544/http://www.dasma.com/safetygdoors.asp |archivedate=2012-08-26 }}</ref>\n\n==Safety==\nGarage doors cause injury and property damage (including expensive damage to the door itself) in several different ways. The most common causes of injury from garage door systems include falling doors, pinch points, improperly adjusted opener force settings and safety eyes, attempts at do-it-yourself repair without the proper knowledge or tools, and uncontrolled release of spring tension (on torsion spring systems).\n\nA garage door with a broken spring, or the wrong strength spring, can fall. Because the effective mass of the door increases as the garage door sections transfer from the horizontal to vertical door tracks, a falling garage door accelerates rapidly. A free falling garage door can cause serious injury or death.\n\nThe sections and rollers on garage doors represent a major pinch hazard. Children should never be allowed near a moving garage door for this reason. On manually operated garage doors, handles should be installed vertically, to promote \"vertical orientation of the hand\".\n\nMechanical garage door openers can pull or push a garage door with enough force to injure or kill people and pets if they become trapped. All modern openers are equipped with \u201cforce settings\u201d that make the door reverse if it encounters too much resistance while closing or opening. Any garage door opener sold in the United States after 1992 requires ''safety eyes''\u2014sensors that prevent the door from closing if obstructed. Force settings should cause a door to stop or reverse on encountering more than approximately 20&nbsp;lbs (9.07&nbsp;kg) of resistance. Safety eyes should be installed a maximum of six inches above the ground. Many garage door injuries, and nearly all garage door related property damage, can be avoided by following these precautions.\n\nCertain parts, especially springs, cables, bottom brackets, and spring anchor plates, are under extreme tension. Injuries can occur if parts under tension are removed.\n\nExtension spring systems should always be restrained by a ''safety cable'' that runs through the middle of the spring, tying off to a solid point at the rear and front of the horizontal door track. The safety cable prevents hazards to bystanders when a spring, pulley, or cable breaks under tension and makes the system quite safe.\n\nTorsion spring systems can be very dangerous as they are always under tension and release energy when the spring fails. Serious injury or death can be caused by the projectile pieces of a failed torsion spring. Many people have been injured or killed trying to adjust torsion springs, and special training and procedures are required to safely adjust a torsion spring, it is a job for a professional not a homeowner or DIYer.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category-inline|Garage doors}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Garage Door}}\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n[[Category:Doors]]\n[[Category:Garages (residential)]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{original research|date=November 2012}}\n{{more citations needed|date=September 2012}}\n}}\n\n[[File:Garage door sliding up.jpg|right|thumb|Sectional garage door]]\n[[File:Garage door.JPG|thumb|right|Up-and-over garage door]]\n\nA '''garage door''' is a large [[door]] on a [[Garage (house)|garage]] that opens either manually or by an electric motor (a [[garage door opener]]).

Their lifting weight capacity can best be identified by the color that is painted on the ends of the springs.\n\n==Maintenance==\nMaintenance of garage door is described in the manufacturer's instructions and consists of periodic checks for correct operation, visual inspection of parts, and lubrication.\n<ref name=\"dasma.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dasma.com/safetygdmaint.asp |title=DASMA Door and Access Systems Manufacturers Association |publisher=Dasma.com |date=1993-01-01 |access-date=2012-11-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028213832/http://www.dasma.com/SafetyGDMaint.asp |archive-date=2012-10-28 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dasma.com/safetygdoors.asp |title=DASMA Door and Access Systems Manufacturers Association |publisher=Dasma.com |accessdate=2012-11-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826054544/http://www.dasma.com/safetygdoors.asp |archivedate=2012-08-26 }}</ref>\n\n==Safety==\nGarage doors cause injury and property damage (including expensive damage to the door itself) in several different ways. The most common causes of injury from garage door systems include falling doors, pinch points, improperly adjusted opener force settings and safety eyes, attempts at do-it-yourself repair without the proper knowledge or tools, and uncontrolled release of spring tension (on torsion spring systems).\n\nA garage door with a broken spring, or the wrong strength spring, can fall. Because the effective mass of the door increases as the garage door sections transfer from the horizontal to vertical door tracks, a falling garage door accelerates rapidly. A free falling garage door can cause serious injury or death.\n\nThe sections and rollers on garage doors represent a major pinch hazard. Children should never be allowed near a moving garage door for this reason. On manually operated garage doors, handles should be installed vertically, to promote \"vertical orientation of the hand\".\n\nMechanical garage door openers can pull or push a garage door with enough force to injure or kill people and pets if they become trapped. All modern openers are equipped with \u201cforce settings\u201d that make the door reverse if it encounters too much resistance while closing or opening. Any garage door opener sold in the United States after 1992 requires ''safety eyes''\u2014sensors that prevent the door from closing if obstructed. Force settings should cause a door to stop or reverse on encountering more than approximately 20&nbsp;lbs (9.07&nbsp;kg) of resistance. Safety eyes should be installed a maximum of six inches above the ground. Many garage door injuries, and nearly all garage door related property damage, can be avoided by following these precautions.\n\nCertain parts, especially springs, cables, bottom brackets, and spring anchor plates, are under extreme tension. Injuries can occur if parts under tension are removed.\n\nExtension spring systems should always be restrained by a ''safety cable'' that runs through the middle of the spring, tying off to a solid point at the rear and front of the horizontal door track. The safety cable prevents hazards to bystanders when a spring, pulley, or cable breaks under tension and makes the system quite safe.\n\nTorsion spring systems can be very dangerous as they are always under tension and release energy when the spring fails. Serious injury or death can be caused by the projectile pieces of a failed torsion spring. Many people have been injured or killed trying to adjust torsion springs, and special training and procedures are required to safely adjust a torsion spring, it is a job for a professional not a homeowner or DIYer.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category-inline|Garage doors}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Garage Door}}\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n[[Category:Doors]]\n[[Category:Garages (residential)]]\n", "name_user": "ShairazMasood", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eMaintenance)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garage_door"}

He played professionally for the [[Minnesota Vikings]], [[Seattle Seahawks]], and [[Buffalo Bills]].\n\nThe Vikings selected Jackson in the second round of the [[2006 NFL Draft]], and Jackson played for the Vikings from 2006 to 2010. A reserve quarterback for much of his time with the Vikings, Jackson was starting quarterback for the [[2007 Minnesota Vikings season|2007 season]] and part of the [[2008 Minnesota Vikings season|2008 season]], after which Jackson started the Vikings' [[2008\u201309 NFL playoffs#NFC: Philadelphia Eagles 26, Minnesota Vikings 14|Wild Card playoff game]]. In 2011, Jackson signed with the Seahawks and was starting quarterback for [[2011 Seattle Seahawks season|the 2011 season]].

They were also impressed by his workout at the [[NFL Combine|scouting combine]] (among the top 5 quarterbacks in ball speed and the 40-yard dash). Several NFL teams, including the Vikings, had arranged secret workouts with him too. Jackson was selected with the last pick in the 2nd round (64th overall) of the [[2006 NFL Draft]], while he was projected to go much later, in the sixth or seventh round.<ref name=\"draft scout\"/> The Vikings traded two 3rd round picks to get the 2nd round pick with which they drafted Jackson, fearing he might get picked sooner than anticipated. Jackson's early selection caused some surprise, as he was the 5th quarterback taken and the 1st [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I-AA]] player selected (the previous I-AA quarterback drafted was [[Spergon Wynn]] in 2000). He was also the first quarterback from Alabama State to be drafted into the NFL since Ricky Jones in 1992. Even Jackson was surprised by the pick, saying, \"I was more focused on [getting drafted in] the third round and even that was stretching it\".<ref>[http://www.onnidan.com/05-06/news/april/alst0429.htm Jackson's Reaction].

He also showed great scrambling skills averaging 11.3 yards in rushing (the only Viking other than [[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]] to average more than 3.3 yards in rushing). [[ESPN]] analyst [[Mike Tirico]] referred to Jackson as a right-handed [[Michael Vick]]. His pre-season performance was enough to surpass second and third-string quarterbacks [[Mike McMahon (American football)|Mike McMahon]] and [[J. T. O'Sullivan]] on the depth chart. After the pre-season, McMahon and O'Sullivan were cut from the team and [[Brooks Bollinger]] was brought in, whom Jackson then competed against for the number two spot.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pasquarelli |first1=Len |authorlink1=Len Pasquarelli |title=Backing up Brad: Vikings get QB Bollinger from Jets |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=2568097 |accessdate=April 13, 2020 |agency=ESPN.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=2006 NFL Preseason Statistics |url=http://www.nfl.com/stats/player?seasonId=2006&seasonType=PRE&Submit=Go |website=NFL.com |accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn September 25, 2006, Jackson had minor knee surgery to repair the [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] in his knee.

Although Johnson had not thrown an interception that game and had a respectable passer rating of 94.2 in the game, the Minnesota fans jeered Johnson throughout the game and chanted \"We want Jackson!\" at numerous points because Johnson had only thrown nine touchdowns all season (in 14 games) and had a career worst 71.9 passer rating throughout the season. Jackson received a standing ovation as he trotted out onto the field. A landmark in Jackson's career happened that game when Jackson completed his first touchdown pass to [[Mewelde Moore]].

Jackson played [[college football]] for the [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas Razorbacks]] and [[Alabama State Hornets football|Alabama State Hornets]]. He played professionally for the [[Minnesota Vikings]], [[Seattle Seahawks]], and [[Buffalo Bills]].\n\nThe Vikings selected Jackson in the second round of the [[2006 NFL Draft]], and Jackson played for the Vikings from 2006 to 2010. A reserve quarterback for much of his time with the Vikings, Jackson was starting quarterback for the [[2007 Minnesota Vikings season|2007 season]] and part of the [[2008 Minnesota Vikings season|2008 season]], after which Jackson started the Vikings' [[2008\u201309 NFL playoffs#NFC: Philadelphia Eagles 26, Minnesota Vikings 14|Wild Card playoff game]]. In 2011, Jackson signed with the Seahawks and was starting quarterback for [[2011 Seattle Seahawks season|the 2011 season]]. Jackson was then traded to the Bills before the [[2012 NFL season]] but never played a game. Jackson returned to the Seahawks in 2013. He was the backup quarterback for [[Russell Wilson]] during their [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] win over the [[Denver Broncos]].\n\n==Early life and college career==\nJackson was born and raised in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], and graduated from [[Sidney Lanier High School]] of Montgomery in 2001.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/sports/college/rankinfile/2016/02/29/montgomery-native-tarvaris-jackson-talks-lanier-alabama-state-football/81114924/ |title=Montgomery native Tarvaris Jackson talks Lanier, ASU football |website=The Montgomery Advertiser |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"middle name\">{{citation|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080408104029/http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/11986316.html|archivedate=April 8, 2008|url=https://www.startribune.com/c-j-ta-var-i-us-or-tar-var-is-just-call-him-dad/11986316/|author=C.J.|title=Ta-var-i-us or Tar-var-is?

They were also impressed by his workout at the [[NFL Combine|scouting combine]] (among the top 5 quarterbacks in ball speed and the 40-yard dash). Several NFL teams, including the Vikings, had arranged secret workouts with him too. Jackson was selected with the last pick in the 2nd round (64th overall) of the [[2006 NFL Draft]], while he was projected to go much later, in the sixth or seventh round.<ref name=\"draft scout\"/> The Vikings traded two 3rd round picks to get the 2nd round pick with which they drafted Jackson, fearing he might get picked sooner than anticipated. Jackson's early selection caused some surprise, as he was the 5th quarterback taken and the 1st [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I-AA]] player selected (the previous I-AA quarterback drafted was [[Spergon Wynn]] in 2000). He was also the first quarterback from Alabama State to be drafted into the NFL since Ricky Jones in 1992. Even Jackson was surprised by the pick, saying, \"I was more focused on [getting drafted in] the third round and even that was stretching it\".<ref>[http://www.onnidan.com/05-06/news/april/alst0429.htm Jackson's Reaction]. Jackson's reaction after getting drafted.</ref> Most pre-draft publications did not even have him listed as one of the top 10 eligible quarterbacks, while he was the 5th selected. On July 26, 2006, Jackson signed a four-year deal with Minnesota, including a $1&nbsp;million signing bonus.<ref>\"[http://www.cbc.ca/cp/football/060726/f072680.html Vikings sign quarterback Tarvaris Jackson to four-year contract]\".

Childress quotes before the draft.</ref>\n\nThe day after the draft, Childress was quoted by the ''[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]'' as saying: \"I think you judge quarterbacks a little bit differently...When you see what you want at the quarterback position, you need to go get it. And that's exactly what I see with Tarvaris Jackson is a guy that's a piece of clay, that has all the skills in terms of, No. 1, what's he look like throwing the football?...He's got a great throwing motion; he's athletic. He has all those things that we're looking for, and he's wired right. That's important for a quarterback. I think he's a flatline guy. I think he's a sponge. You're talking about a guy that never had a coach there as a quarterback coach. So what can he do with coaching?\"<ref>\"That's a good question,\" many people reply, noting that Jackson is Seattle's only Black Mormon. http://vikings.scout.com/2/526690.html Childress Quotes after draft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060828071130/http://vikings.scout.com/2/526690.html |date=August 28, 2006}}.</ref>\n\n===Minnesota Vikings===\n\n====2006 season====\nJackson's 2006 pre-season [[passer rating]] was 106.1, 15th in the league out of 110 quarterbacks who performed. Only one quarterback from his draft class ([[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]]) did better. He also showed great scrambling skills averaging 11.3 yards in rushing (the only Viking other than [[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]] to average more than 3.3 yards in rushing). [[ESPN]] analyst [[Mike Tirico]] referred to Jackson as a right-handed [[Michael Vick]]. His pre-season performance was enough to surpass second and third-string quarterbacks [[Mike McMahon (American football)|Mike McMahon]] and [[J. T. O'Sullivan]] on the depth chart. After the pre-season, McMahon and O'Sullivan were cut from the team and [[Brooks Bollinger]] was brought in, whom Jackson then competed against for the number two spot.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pasquarelli |first1=Len |authorlink1=Len Pasquarelli |title=Backing up Brad: Vikings get QB Bollinger from Jets |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=2568097 |accessdate=April 13, 2020 |agency=ESPN.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=2006 NFL Preseason Statistics |url=http://www.nfl.com/stats/player?seasonId=2006&seasonType=PRE&Submit=Go |website=NFL.com |accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn September 25, 2006, Jackson had minor knee surgery to repair the [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] in his knee. He returned to limited practice after two weeks, and then came back to play his first NFL game with the Vikings in week 13 against the [[2006 Chicago Bears|Chicago Bears]]<ref>[http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/sports/15727620.htm HOME - TwinCities.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in the fourth quarter after Johnson was benched for throwing four interceptions and backup quarterback Brooks Bollinger was injured. Jackson completed three of his four passes before fumbling the ball to Chicago and the Bears then ran the clock out. Following this game when Jackson was asked if he was ready to take over as starter he said \"Not really...We still have a chance to make the playoffs, so we're still trying to do that. So it's obvious that Brad is still our quarterback so we can stay on that.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Vikings Staring at a Quarterback Controversy|url=http://www.sportsnetwork.com/default.asp?c=sportsnetwork&page=/nfl/news/ABN4052702.htm|author=Benoit, Andy|publisher=The Sports Network|accessdate=May 9, 2007}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n\nIn Week 15, Johnson started the game but was benched in the fourth quarter when the Vikings had been underperforming the entire game losing by a score of 26\u20137 at the time Jackson went in late in the third quarter against the [[2006 New York Jets|New York Jets]]. Although Johnson had not thrown an interception that game and had a respectable passer rating of 94.2 in the game, the Minnesota fans jeered Johnson throughout the game and chanted \"We want Jackson!\" at numerous points because Johnson had only thrown nine touchdowns all season (in 14 games) and had a career worst 71.9 passer rating throughout the season. Jackson received a standing ovation as he trotted out onto the field. A landmark in Jackson's career happened that game when Jackson completed his first touchdown pass to [[Mewelde Moore]]. Jackson threw 177 yards, one touchdown, and ran three times for 20 yards while the Jets protected their large lead. He also threw an interception in the red zone.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200612170min.htm |title=New York Jets at Minnesota Vikings - December 17th, 2006 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\nJackson was named the starting quarterback for Minnesota towards the end of his rookie season. Jackson's first game was a week 16 night game against the [[2006 Green Bay Packers|Green Bay Packers]] at [[Lambeau Field]]. Game conditions were very poor. A steady rain fell throughout the evening and the kickoff temperature was only 36 degrees Fahrenheit. The Vikings lost by a score of 9\u20137 with the only Vikings score coming from an interception for a touchdown by defensive back [[Fred Smoot]]. The offense set a franchise low record of only three first downs the whole game, did not get close enough to the end zone to even attempt a field goal, and only had 27 passing yards gained against the NFL's 19th ranked defense (ranked 26th against the pass).

It connects [[Middlesbrough]], on the south bank, to [[Port Clarence]], on the north bank.  It is a [[transporter bridge]], carrying a travelling 'car', or 'gondola', suspended from the bridge, across the river in 90 seconds. The gondola can carry 200 people, 9 cars, or 6 cars and one minibus. It carries the [[A178 road|A178]] Middlesbrough to Hartlepool road. Locally, the bridge is often referred to simply as 'the Transporter'.\n\n[[File:Middlesbrough transporter bridge (Wonder Book of Engineering Wonders, 1931).jpg|thumbnail|The gondola in 1931]]\n\n== History ==\n\nThe idea of a transporter bridge across the River Tees was first mooted in 1872 when Charles Smith, Manager of the Hartlepool Iron Works, submitted a scheme to Middlesbrough Corporation.  However, the scheme was not pursued, and it would not be until the new century that the idea of a transporter bridge across the river would again be revisited. Following a 1907 [[Act of Parliament]] the Bridge was built at a cost of [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]68,026 6[[Shilling (British coin)|s]] 8[[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d]] (equivalent to \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|68026|1907|{{Inflation-year|UK}}|r=-4}}}} in {{inflation-year|UK}} values),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} by [[Sir William Arrol & Co.]] of Glasgow between 1910 and 1911 to replace the 'Hugh Bell' and 'Erimus' steam [[ferry]] services.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Howes |first= Brian |authorlink= |date=May 2009 |title=Building the Past \u2013 Middlesbrough Transport Bridge|journal=Best of British |volume= |issue= |pages=73 |issn=1355-6681}}</ref> A transporter bridge was chosen because Parliament ruled that the new scheme of crossing the river had to avoid affecting the river navigation.

In 1953, the gondola got stuck half-way. While it was stuck, [[gale]] force winds lashed water to within inches of it. However, despite this the gondola and the Transporter Bridge are still running in perfect order.\n\nIn 1974, the comedy actor [[Terry Scott]], travelling between his hotel in Middlesbrough and a performance at the [[Billingham]] Forum, mistook the bridge for a regular toll crossing and drove his [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] off the end of the roadway, landing in the safety netting beneath.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tees-19947021 |title=Transporter Bridge celebrations end with time capsule |work=BBC News (Tees) Website |date=15 October 2012 |publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=22 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1993, the bridge was awarded the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]]' highest honour, The Heritage Plaque, for engineering excellence, in recognition of the Council's efforts in keeping the bridge in good working order. Its historical importance was also recognised in 1985 by its listing as a Grade II* [[Listed Building]] and its prominence as a local landmark was further enhanced in 1993 by the installation of floodlights that operate during the winter months.\n\nIt has been featured in films and TV programmes including ''[[Boys from the Blackstuff]]'', ''[[Billy Elliot]]'', ''[[The Fast Show]]'', ''[[Spender]]'', and ''[[Steel River Blues]]''. In the [[millennium]] celebrations of 2000, [[firework]]s were fired from its length. The storyline of the third series of ''[[Auf Wiedersehen, Pet]]'', saw the bridge dismantled to be sold to and re-erected in the USA. The local council received calls from people worried that the bridge was really being pulled down,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1985075.stm |title=Bridge not under threat, pet |work=BBC News |date=13 May 2002 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=20 January 2009 }}</ref> with the BBC adding a disclaimer on the end of the final episode of the series stating that 'The Transporter Bridge is still in Middlesbrough'.\n\nIn July 2000 a visitor centre was opened on land previously occupied by the bridge workshop<ref name=allan111>{{cite book |last=Allan |first=Dave |date=2011 |title=The Transporter 100 Years of the Tees Transporter Bridge |publisher=Middlesbrough Council |page=111 |isbn=0860830896 }}</ref> In August 2019, the bridge was temporarily closed for engineering works.\n\n== Facts and figures ==\n\nThe Tees Transporter Bridge has an overall length (including cantilevers) of {{convert|851|ft|m}}, leaving a span between the centres of the towers of {{convert|590|ft|m}}, the beam of the bridge being carried at a height of {{convert|160|ft|m}} above the road.

Middlesbrough Council has control of the day-to-day operations and maintenance.  In 2011 the Tees Transporter Bridge received a \u00a32.6&nbsp;million Heritage Lottery Fund award for improvement and renovation work to mark the Bridge's centenary. The improvement works include the installation of a glass viewing lift to the landmark's upper walkway and renovation of the gondola. The bridge was closed on 27 August 2013 for 40 days repainting. It was then discovered that repairs were needed. The bridge was re-opened for traffic on 6 April 2015, but improvement work continued with the bridge still in daily use. These were completed in September 2015 after more than \u00a34&nbsp;million had been spent on the structure.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tees Transporter Bridge reopens |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tees-31787804 |accessdate=15 October 2018 |work=BBC News |date=9 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Engineering Timelines - Middlesbrough Transporter Bridge |url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=6 |website=www.engineering-timelines.com |accessdate=15 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe bridge is a Grade II* [[Listed Building]], and other elements, such as its Winch House, piers, railings, and gates, are Grade II listed.<ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1139845|desc=Transporter Bridge|accessdate=18 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1139847|desc=Winch House, Adjoining Railings, Wall, Gates and Gatepiers, C.40M South West of Transporter Bridge|accessdate=18 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1139846|desc=Piers, Railings and Gates at Entrance to Transporter Bridge|accessdate=18 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn 5 March 2015, the Royal Mail issued a set of 10 First Class postage stamps featuring iconic British bridges including the Tees Transporter Bridge.\n\n== Vintage bus running day ==\n\n[[Image:Daimler Fleetline JDC544L at the Transporter Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|Daimler Fleetline JDC544L at the Transporter Bridge]]\n\nThe bridge is also host to an annual vintage bus running day, organised by The 500 Group.<ref>[http://www.500group.org.uk/ The 500 Group] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403100213/http://www.500group.org.uk/ |date=3 April 2007 }}</ref> On this one day per year, usually a Sunday in April, vintage buses take people on free rides around [[Teesside]].

Locally, the bridge is often referred to simply as 'the Transporter'.\n\n[[File:Middlesbrough transporter bridge (Wonder Book of Engineering Wonders, 1931).jpg|thumbnail|The gondola in 1931]]\n\n== History ==\n\nThe idea of a transporter bridge across the River Tees was first mooted in 1872 when Charles Smith, Manager of the Hartlepool Iron Works, submitted a scheme to Middlesbrough Corporation.  However, the scheme was not pursued, and it would not be until the new century that the idea of a transporter bridge across the river would again be revisited. Following a 1907 [[Act of Parliament]] the Bridge was built at a cost of [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]68,026 6[[Shilling (British coin)|s]] 8[[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d]] (equivalent to \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|68026|1907|{{Inflation-year|UK}}|r=-4}}}} in {{inflation-year|UK}} values),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} by [[Sir William Arrol & Co.]] of Glasgow between 1910 and 1911 to replace the 'Hugh Bell' and 'Erimus' steam [[ferry]] services.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Howes |first= Brian |authorlink= |date=May 2009 |title=Building the Past \u2013 Middlesbrough Transport Bridge|journal=Best of British |volume= |issue= |pages=73 |issn=1355-6681}}</ref> A transporter bridge was chosen because Parliament ruled that the new scheme of crossing the river had to avoid affecting the river navigation. Construction work started in July 1909 with [[caisson (engineering)|caissons]] being used to allow workers to dig down to bedrock.<ref name=allan48 /> This turned out to be {{convert|65|ft}} below the high tide mark on the Middlesbrough side and {{convert|90|ft}} on the other.<ref name=allan48>{{cite book |last=Allan |first=Dave |date=2011 |title=The Transporter 100 Years of the Tees Transporter Bridge |publisher=Middlesbrough Council |pages=48\u201349 |isbn=0860830896 }}</ref> The [[Shaft (civil engineering)|shafts]] that had been dug out by this process were then filled with [[concrete]].<ref name=allan50 /> The formal laying of the foundation stones, made of [[Economy of Aberdeen#Granite|Aberdeen granite]], took place in August 1910 when they were laid by Mayor of Middlesbrough Thomas Gibson-Poole and Alderman Joseph McLauchlan, the initiator of the transporter bridge scheme.<ref name=allan50>{{cite book |last=Allan |first=Dave |date=2011 |title=The Transporter 100 Years of the Tees Transporter Bridge |publisher=Middlesbrough Council |page=50|isbn=0860830896 }}</ref>\n\nThe opening ceremony on 17 October 1911 was performed by [[Prince Arthur of Connaught]].<ref name=allan3>{{cite book |last=Allan |first=Dave |date=2011 |title=The Transporter 100 Years of the Tees Transporter Bridge |publisher=Middlesbrough Council |page=3|isbn=0860830896 }}</ref> \nDuring [[World War II]] the superstructure of the bridge was hit by a bomb. In 1953, the gondola got stuck half-way. While it was stuck, [[gale]] force winds lashed water to within inches of it. However, despite this the gondola and the Transporter Bridge are still running in perfect order.\n\nIn 1974, the comedy actor [[Terry Scott]], travelling between his hotel in Middlesbrough and a performance at the [[Billingham]] Forum, mistook the bridge for a regular toll crossing and drove his [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] off the end of the roadway, landing in the safety netting beneath.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tees-19947021 |title=Transporter Bridge celebrations end with time capsule |work=BBC News (Tees) Website |date=15 October 2012 |publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=22 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1993, the bridge was awarded the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]]' highest honour, The Heritage Plaque, for engineering excellence, in recognition of the Council's efforts in keeping the bridge in good working order. Its historical importance was also recognised in 1985 by its listing as a Grade II* [[Listed Building]] and its prominence as a local landmark was further enhanced in 1993 by the installation of floodlights that operate during the winter months.\n\nIt has been featured in films and TV programmes including ''[[Boys from the Blackstuff]]'', ''[[Billy Elliot]]'', ''[[The Fast Show]]'', ''[[Spender]]'', and ''[[Steel River Blues]]''. In the [[millennium]] celebrations of 2000, [[firework]]s were fired from its length. The storyline of the third series of ''[[Auf Wiedersehen, Pet]]'', saw the bridge dismantled to be sold to and re-erected in the USA. The local council received calls from people worried that the bridge was really being pulled down,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1985075.stm |title=Bridge not under threat, pet |work=BBC News |date=13 May 2002 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=20 January 2009 }}</ref> with the BBC adding a disclaimer on the end of the final episode of the series stating that 'The Transporter Bridge is still in Middlesbrough'.\n\nIn July 2000 a visitor centre was opened on land previously occupied by the bridge workshop<ref name=allan111>{{cite book |last=Allan |first=Dave |date=2011 |title=The Transporter 100 Years of the Tees Transporter Bridge |publisher=Middlesbrough Council |page=111 |isbn=0860830896 }}</ref> In August 2019, the bridge was temporarily closed for engineering works.\n\n== Facts and figures ==\n\nThe Tees Transporter Bridge has an overall length (including cantilevers) of {{convert|851|ft|m}}, leaving a span between the centres of the towers of {{convert|590|ft|m}}, the beam of the bridge being carried at a height of {{convert|160|ft|m}} above the road. The bridge is the longest remaining transporter bridge in the world.\n[[File:Transporter Bridge.jpg|alt=Transporter Bridge - April 2018|thumb|269x269px|Transporter Bridge - April 2018]]\nThe bridge is currently owned by Middlesbrough Council and Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council. Middlesbrough Council has control of the day-to-day operations and maintenance.  In 2011 the Tees Transporter Bridge received a \u00a32.6&nbsp;million Heritage Lottery Fund award for improvement and renovation work to mark the Bridge's centenary. The improvement works include the installation of a glass viewing lift to the landmark's upper walkway and renovation of the gondola. The bridge was closed on 27 August 2013 for 40 days repainting. It was then discovered that repairs were needed. The bridge was re-opened for traffic on 6 April 2015, but improvement work continued with the bridge still in daily use. These were completed in September 2015 after more than \u00a34&nbsp;million had been spent on the structure.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tees Transporter Bridge reopens |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tees-31787804 |accessdate=15 October 2018 |work=BBC News |date=9 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Engineering Timelines - Middlesbrough Transporter Bridge |url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=6 |website=www.engineering-timelines.com |accessdate=15 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe bridge is a Grade II* [[Listed Building]], and other elements, such as its Winch House, piers, railings, and gates, are Grade II listed.<ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1139845|desc=Transporter Bridge|accessdate=18 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1139847|desc=Winch House, Adjoining Railings, Wall, Gates and Gatepiers, C.40M South West of Transporter Bridge|accessdate=18 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1139846|desc=Piers, Railings and Gates at Entrance to Transporter Bridge|accessdate=18 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn 5 March 2015, the Royal Mail issued a set of 10 First Class postage stamps featuring iconic British bridges including the Tees Transporter Bridge.\n\n== Vintage bus running day ==\n\n[[Image:Daimler Fleetline JDC544L at the Transporter Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|Daimler Fleetline JDC544L at the Transporter Bridge]]\n\nThe bridge is also host to an annual vintage bus running day, organised by The 500 Group.<ref>[http://www.500group.org.uk/ The 500 Group] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403100213/http://www.500group.org.uk/ |date=3 April 2007 }}</ref> On this one day per year, usually a Sunday in April, vintage buses take people on free rides around [[Teesside]].
