The fictional series focuses on the lives of surgical [[internship (medicine)|interns,]] [[residency (medicine)|residents]], and [[attending physician|attending doctor]]s, as they develop into seasoned doctors while trying to maintain personal lives and relationships. The title is an allusion to ''[[Gray's Anatomy]]'', a classic human anatomy textbook first published in 1858 in London and written by [[Henry Gray]]. [[Shonda Rhimes]] developed the pilot and continues to write for the series; she is also one of the executive producers, along with [[Betsy Beers]], [[Mark Gordon]], [[Krista Vernoff]], [[Rob Corn]], [[Mark Wilding]], and [[Allan Heinberg]]. Although the series is set in [[Seattle]] (at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, later renamed), it is filmed primarily in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].\n\nThe series is designed to be racially diverse and uses [[color-blind casting]]. It revolves around the title character, Dr. [[Meredith Grey]], played by [[Ellen Pompeo]], first featured as an intern. The original cast consisted of nine star-billed actors: Pompeo, [[Sandra Oh]], [[Katherine Heigl]], [[Justin Chambers]], [[T. R. Knight]], [[Chandra Wilson]], [[James Pickens Jr.]], [[Isaiah Washington]] and [[Patrick Dempsey]]. The cast has undergone major changes through the series' run, with many members leaving and being replaced by [[List of Grey's Anatomy characters|others]]. At the start of [[Grey's Anatomy (season 16)|sixteenth season]], the show had a large ensemble of fourteen actors, including four characters from the original cast (Meredith Grey, Alex Karev, Miranda Bailey, and Richard Webber), with Justin Chambers leaving the show during the season.\n\n''Grey's Anatomy'' was renewed for a [[Grey's Anatomy (season 16)|sixteenth season]] which premiered on September 26, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hypable.com/greys-anatomy-season-16-release-date-trailer-episodes/|title='Grey's Anatomy' season 16 premiere date, trailer, episode guide and more|date=2019-10-11|website=Hypable|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref> The series' success catapulted such long-running cast members as Pompeo, Dempsey and Oh to worldwide recognition; they were among the top five highest-earning television actors in 2013.<ref name=\"bustle2013\">{{cite web|title=How Much Does The 'Grey's Anatomy' Cast Make?

Robbins cheats on Torres with a visiting facial reconstruction surgeon. ''Grey's Anatomy'' then concluded its 10th season and saw the departure of one of its major players, Cristina Yang, played by Sandra Oh. The eleventh season also saw the introduction of the new Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Maggie Pearce, Richard's secret daughter with Ellis Grey. Towards the end of the eleventh season, Derek Shepherd witnesses a car accident and pulls over to help the injured, but his car is hit by a truck with him inside as he attempts to leave the scene. He later dies at another hospital following the doctors' mishandling of his injuries. The season 12 finale saw the departure of one of the show's longest running characters, Callie Torres, played by Sara Ramirez. Altman returns to Seattle at the beginning of the 14th season while Robbins and Kepner depart at the season's end to pursue other career opportunities.

The fictional series focuses on the lives of surgical [[internship (medicine)|interns,]] [[residency (medicine)|residents]], and [[attending physician|attending doctor]]s, as they develop into seasoned doctors while trying to maintain personal lives and relationships. The title is an allusion to ''[[Gray's Anatomy]]'', a classic human anatomy textbook first published in 1858 in London and written by [[Henry Gray]]. [[Shonda Rhimes]] developed the pilot and continues to write for the series; she is also one of the executive producers, along with [[Betsy Beers]], [[Mark Gordon]], [[Krista Vernoff]], [[Rob Corn]], [[Mark Wilding]], and [[Allan Heinberg]]. Although the series is set in [[Seattle]] (at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, later renamed), it is filmed primarily in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].\n\nThe series is designed to be racially diverse and uses [[color-blind casting]]. It revolves around the title character, Dr. [[Meredith Grey]], played by [[Ellen Pompeo]], first featured as an intern. The original cast consisted of nine star-billed actors: Pompeo, [[Sandra Oh]], [[Katherine Heigl]], [[Justin Chambers]], [[T. R. Knight]], [[Chandra Wilson]], [[James Pickens Jr.]], [[Isaiah Washington]] and [[Patrick Dempsey]]. The cast has undergone major changes through the series' run, with many members leaving and being replaced by [[List of Grey's Anatomy characters|others]].

Robbins cheats on Torres with a visiting facial reconstruction surgeon. ''Grey's Anatomy'' then concluded its 10th season and saw the departure of one of its major players, Cristina Yang, played by Sandra Oh. The eleventh season also saw the introduction of the new Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Maggie Pearce, Richard's secret daughter with Ellis Grey. Towards the end of the eleventh season, Derek Shepherd witnesses a car accident and pulls over to help the injured, but his car is hit by a truck with him inside as he attempts to leave the scene. He later dies at another hospital following the doctors' mishandling of his injuries. The season 12 finale saw the departure of one of the show's longest running characters, Callie Torres, played by Sara Ramirez. Altman returns to Seattle at the beginning of the 14th season while Robbins and Kepner depart at the season's end to pursue other career opportunities.
