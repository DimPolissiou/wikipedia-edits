Kenshin wanders the country offering protection and aid to those in need, as atonement for the killings he once committed as an assassin. In Tokyo, he meets a young woman named Kamiya Kaoru, who invites him to live in her dojo despite learning about Kenshin's past. Throughout the series, Kenshin begins to establish relationships with many people, including ex-enemies, while dealing with his fair share of foes, new and old.\n\n===Kamiya Kaoru===\n{{Main|Kamiya Kaoru}}\n{{nihongo|Kamiya Kaoru|\u795e\u8c37 \u85ab}} is the instructor of a kendo school in Tokyo called ''Kamiya Kasshin-ry\u016b''. All of its students leave when a large number of people are killed by someone claiming to be ''Hitokiri Batt\u014dsai'' and a practitioner of ''Kamiya Kasshin-ry\u016b'', damaging her school's reputation. Kaoru is saved from this murderous impostor by the real ''Batt\u014dsai'', Himura Kenshin, now a pacifist wanderer. Kaoru invites Kenshin to stay at her dojo as she notes that he is a gentle person instead of a ''hitokiri''. As the series continues, Kaoru develops strong romantic feelings for Kenshin, who is constantly haunted by his past deeds and believes he does not deserve happiness.\n\n===My\u014djin Yahiko===\n{{Main|My\u014djin Yahiko}}\n{{nihongo|My\u014djin Yahiko|\u660e\u795e \u5f25\u5f66}} is an orphan from a [[samurai]] family who was forced to work as a [[pickpocket]] to repay the debt he had presumably owed, as his parents died before they could repay it. When he is rescued by Himura Kenshin, he decides that he will grow up to be just like Kenshin. But because of his strong beliefs, Kenshin will not teach the sword style he had learned. Therefore, Kenshin arranges for Yahiko to be trained in ''Kamiya Kasshin-ry\u016b'' by Kamiya Kaoru.

She is loyal to her friends and is always there to heal their wounds, especially Sanosuke, whom she often cautions about fighting.

Despite this version and her final version in the main series being so different, Watsuki said that they have the same spirit and therefore are not so unalike. Although he admitted the one-shot's version of Megumi had a \"lighter quality\" because of her small role, so he therefore gave her a more \"earthy quality\" in the main serial so she could make an impression. By the time of the publication of ''Rurouni Kenshin'' volume four, Watsuki felt some disappointment as she did not turn out nearly the way he wanted. However, because she is entertaining to draw and is the only other woman whom Kaoru can interact with, he planned to have Megumi appear frequently as a secondary character. Watsuki's used the young grandmother from [[Takeshi Obata]]'s ''Cyborg Jii-chan G'' as the design model for Megumi.

She wishes to learn what happened to Aoshi and his comrades and follows Kenshin on his way to Kyoto hoping to meet him again.{{gnr|ch|64}} When she learns of how Aoshi has become evil and obsessed with revenge, she decides to take over his title as \"Okashira\" and tries to forget him but she can not.

After Kaoru's father died, the elder brother {{nihongo|Kihei|\u559c\u5175\u885b}} collapsed in front of the dojo and Kaoru took him in; becoming a kind of a live-in apprentice and gaining Kaoru's trust, while trying to persuade her to sell the dojo.{{gnr|ch|1}} {{nihongo|Gohei|\u4f0d\u5175\u885b}}, a former samurai who falsely uses the \"''Hitokiri Batt\u014dsai''\" and ''Kamiya Kasshin-ry\u016b'' names to commit murders. They use the {{nihongo|''Kiheikan''|\u9b3c\u5175\u9928}}, a former dojo in a neighboring town that has become a gathering spot for gamblers and rogues, as their base of operations.{{gnr|ch|1}} When Kaoru begins to discover the truth, the brothers attempt to kill her, but Kenshin easily defeats them after revealing himself to be the real ''Hitokiri Batt\u014dsai''.{{gnr|ch|1}} Having escaped jail, the brothers appear again hiring Sanosuke to fight Kenshin and planning to use a gun to kill a weakened Kenshin.{{gnr|ch|5}} When Kenshin defeats Sanosuke, Kenshin stops Kihei's bullet dead on the guard of his sword. When the brothers then try to attack Kaoru and Yahiko, Sanosuke defeats Gohei and Kenshin injures Kihei into submission.{{gnr|ch|7}} Later in the series, they are employed as bodyguards by [[#Fud\u014dsawa|Fud\u014dsawa]], a [[yakuza]] in Sanosuke's hometown, and then by [[#Tani J\u016bsanr\u014d|Tani J\u016bsanr\u014d]]. Sanosuke easily beats them up on both occasions.{{gnr|ch|228|, |234}}\n\nIn the anime, Gohei is the only brother to appear and is more intelligent than his manga counterpart. He is a former student at the Kamiya dojo, but when Gohei insisted using swords for killing and then unsuccessfully attacked the master of the dojo, Kaoru's father, he received a broken thumb and an expulsion. In the story Gohei tries to take over the Kamiya dojo, but Kenshin prevents him from doing so. Gohei hires Sanosuke to defeat Kenshin, but this fails. Later, he hires the Kisaki brothers to defeat Kenshin. Though they almost succeed, the brothers are defeated and Yahiko sends Gohei limping away after kicking him in the genitals. Gohei is voiced by Tetsuo Komura in Japanese, by [[Beau Billingslea]] in the Media Blasters dub and by [[Richard Epcar]] in the Sony ''Samurai X'' dub.\n\nWatsuki described the creation of the brothers as a \"direct function of the story.\" Watsuki wanted \"interesting villains to start things off with a bang\" and made one \"brainy\" and the other \"wild.\" He decided that the story involving the two coming together was taking \"too many\" pages, so he made the duo as brothers instead of being \"circumstantially related.\" He used a manager and director from Takeshi Obata's ''Chikarabito Densetsu'' sumo manga as a model for Kihei and a character he found in a magazine that made him think \"Ooh, ''impact''!\" for Gohei. Watsuki stated that, unlike the faces of Kenshin and other characters, the faces of Kihei and Gohei are of basic shapes and therefore the two were easy to draw as a result. He said that he became fonder of the brothers as his deadlines approached.<ref>Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (4) Hiruma Kihei & Gohei,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 1.

But when he was about to be disciplined for killing people he was not supposed to, he escaped and switched sides to the Ishin Shishi and became a ''hitokiri'' for hire in Kyoto.{{gnr|ch|10|, |11}} He now appears as a man dressed in a long kimono with a long scarf and straw hat, and has a unique technique to project [[qi|chi]] toward people, hypnotizing them with his eyes via the {{nihongo|''Shin no Ipp\u014d''|\u5fc3\u306e\u4e00\u65b9||\"One Side of the Soul\"}}.{{gnr|ch|10}} When Kenshin stops him from killing Tani J\u016bsanr\u014d, Jin-e makes Kenshin his next target.{{gnr|ch|10}} Believing the new repenting Kenshin to be soft and weak, Jin-e kidnaps Kaoru Kamiya in order to enrage Kenshin into his old ''Hitokiri Batt\u014dsai'' self.{{gnr|ch|12}} Though he assumes his old mindset and crushes Jin-e's right elbow, ending his life as a swordsman, Kenshin stops himself from killing when Kaoru calls out.{{gnr|ch|13}} Though spared, Jin-e stabs himself in the heart so the police will not discover who his government employer is.{{gnr|ch|14}}\n\nWatsuki intended for the motif of Jin-e to be [[Okada Iz\u014d]], the top ''hitokiri'' of the Bakumatsu, but admitted that his design looks even less like his counterpart than Kenshin's looks like his.<ref name=\"Udo\">Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (7) Ud\u014d Jin-e,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 2. [[Viz Media]]. 168.</ref> He was designed to be a \"murderous ogre\", the \"polar opposite of Kenshin.\" The author described Jin-e as a \"complicated fellow\" who is \"''crazy''-crazy\" and not merely \"crazy-acting.\" Although both the character and story were difficult, Watsuki said it was worth it as Jin-e was the fan-favorite bad guy. He summarized Jin-e as, in a sense, the only character to defeat Kenshin even though he did not defeat ''Batt\u014dsai''. Jin-e's outfit originates from that of [[Serizawa Kamo]], the main character from a Shinsengumi manga released around 14\u201315 years before the release of ''Rurouni Kenshin'' volume two in Japan. Jin-e's laugh, the \"uhu-hu-hu,\" is from the character Ukon played by [[Ry\u014dtar\u014d Sugi]] in the television series ''Kenka-ya Ukon''.<ref name=\"Udo\"/> The third volume of the [[drama CD]]s adapted the Jin-e story.

His kidnapping of Kaoru and fight with Kenshin are similar with some differences. He has holes in both hands from when Kenshin pierced them during the Bakumatsu, where he now inserts hilt-less swords to fight. Watsuki said that a lot of the changes he made to Jin-e in ''Restoration'' did not work out, proving that the original version is perfect. Giving Jin-e a motive to attack Kenshin, lost some of his madness; leaving out the ''Shin no Ipp\u014d'' for being \"too supernatural\", diminished the excitement unique to [[sh\u014dnen manga]]; and the change in his skin tone to make him odder, made keeping the tone of the entire story consistent difficult.<ref name=\"Restoration\">Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"Character/Production Anecdotes Part 56 -People of ''Rurouni Kenshin: Restoration''-\" ''Rurouni Kenshin: Restoration'' Volume 2.

Kanry\u016b wears white since Watsuki felt that \"between Kenshin and Aoshi, there was too much black already.\" Watsuki felt that since he put so much emphasis on Megumi and the Oniwabansh\u016b, Kanry\u016b never became the character he intended, which \"was a bit of a letdown.\" The historical Takeda Kanry\u016bsai is well known as having been homosexual and Watsuki considered making Kanry\u016b homosexual as well, but dropped the idea as he felt it would \"unnecessarily complicate things.\"<ref>Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (12) Takeda Kanry\u016b,\" ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' Volume 4.

When Raij\u016bta is confronted with the choice of actually killing someone, Kenshin explains what ''satsujin-ken'' truly entails; the weight of the lives you have taken \"dragging you to hell.\" Raij\u016bta's confidence breaks down and he can no longer wield a sword again.{{gnr|ch|43}} In the anime, Raij\u016bta was depicted as an actual murderer, as he ruthlessly killed the thugs he hired for conning his way into Yutar\u014d's fortune, and after his defeat, he was simply arrested.\n\nWatsuki intended for Raij\u016bta to be the opposite of Kenshin, \"intelligently macho and a believer of ''satsujin-ken''.\" But somehow he became \"a total fake\" who became \"a smaller and smaller man\" as the story progressed, until he was \"defeated by a single blow\u2014ending almost as a villain.\" The author concluded that designing and developing Raij\u016bta taught him \"quite a bit\" and he wanted to give Raij\u016bta \"peace\" in future stories, but added \"then again...this guy\u2014! Sigh.\" Raij\u016bta's appearance was originally based on a character in an American superhero comic book,<!--DO NOT say which comic it is UNLESS you use a reliable source that states so.--> but as the story progressed his appearance and personality \"deteriorated.\" Because he had difficulty with \"the complicated details\" in the Oniwabansh\u016b story arc, Watsuki gave Raij\u016bta a relatively simple outfit with only one design flourish, the black feathers, which turned out to be difficult to draw. Watsuki concluded that the development of Raij\u016bta taught him a lot about character design.<ref>Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (16) Isurugi Raij\u016bta,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 6.

Watsuki believes that he was unable to make Arundo's chain-scythe to appear like real chains. The character's design originates from a superhuman soldier in an American comic book<!--DO NOT state who this is without a reliable source documenting it.--> who has a name similar to Arundo's,<ref>[[Nobuhiro Watsuki|Watsuki, Nobuhiro]]. \"The Secret Life of Characters (20) Akamatsu Arundo,\" ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' Volume 7.

Senkaku fights with a pair of [[Ulu|knuckle blades]] and has high speed, contrary to his size. However, this proves to be his undoing, as Kenshin defeats Senkaku in a battle by using the gigantic size as a way to stress out Senkaku's limits, causing his leg to break.{{gnr|ch|69}} The police take Senkaku away, in which Sait\u014d notes he would most likely be executed.{{gnr|ch|71}} In the anime, he manages to escape and is killed by [[Seta S\u014djir\u014d]].\n\nOriginally Senkaku was one of the Juppongatana and so Watsuki put a lot of effort into his creation. But since Shishio and S\u014djir\u014d were present and Kenshin needed to go to Kyoto, he decided to make Senkaku a \"violent village despot.\" Originally the author had Senkaku as an experimental character who could not form any words, but an editor commented that Senkaku \"is not a wild animal\" during a meeting, so Watsuki scrapped this idea. Senkaku had no model for his personality, and after the scrapping of the inarticulation trait he became \"pretty much just muscle-head small fry.\" The origin of Senkaku's design stems from the design of the four Abukuma priests, a group of minor antagonists. Watsuki had no attachment towards the four bald-headed priests, but felt that the cone-shaped head design was \"a waste for an unimportant character.\" So he instead used that design for Senkaku, who Watsuki said turned out to be unimportant also. In retrospect Watsuki felt that he may have been influenced by the Coneheads in a [[Sega Saturn]] commercial, and the Giant Soldier in ''[[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (manga)|Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind]]''. The author felt regret about Senkaku; what he regretted most was how he was unable to use Senkaku's special technique \"Piercing Head-Butt\" in the storyline.<ref>Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (25) Senkaku,\" ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' Volume 9.

Shishio was Kenshin's successor as ''hitokiri'' for the Ishin Shishi. Fearing he would threaten to reveal his victims publicly in order to gain leverage against them, the new Meiji government tried killing Shishio by dousing him in oil and burning him alive. But he survived and has recruited an army to get his revenge, with the government asking Kenshin to stop him.\n\n===Komagata Yumi===\n{{Anime voices|Kanako Irie|[[Wendee Lee]] (TV Series), Claire Hamilton (''New Kyoto Arc'')}}\n\n{{nihongo|Komagata Yumi|\u99d2\u5f62 \u7531\u7f8e}}, also known as {{nihongo|\"Caretaker\"|\u591c\u4f3d|Yotogi}},{{gnr|ch|97}} is Shishio's lover. She was the most famous ''[[oiran]]'' in [[Yoshiwara]] and took pride in it, until the [[Mar\u00eda Luz Incident]].{{gnr|ch|148}} She became reviled at the Japanese government's refusal to compensate the newly emancipated prostitutes due to it regarding them as equivalent to livestock.{{gnr|ch|148}} She serves as Kenshin, Sait\u014d and Sanosuke's guide through Shishio's maze-like hideout, taking them from each duel so as to avoid traps.{{gnr|ch|107}} She is often concerned about Shishio and his medical state.{{gnr|ch|136|, |141}} When Shishio's body becomes overheated in his fight with Kenshin, she runs in between them and pleads with Kenshin to end the duel, but Shishio runs her through with his sword, mortally wounding her in the process and injuring the unguarded Kenshin.{{gnr|ch|144}} Knowing that she has finally been of use to Shishio in his most important battle, she dies happy and released of her former frustration for not being able to fight next to him.{{gnr|ch|144}} She is then seen with Shishio and H\u014dji in hell.{{gnr|ch|148}}\n\nYumi was originally designed to be a sexy accessory for Shishio and nothing more, as Watsuki figured that a villain should always have a \"temptress\" or two around him, and so he was surprised to see her develop into a character so motivated by love. Commenting on her death, the author said he saw happiness for Yumi as following Shishio everywhere and figured \"everywhere\" would include hell. Watsuki had no particular personality model for Yumi, but the character is essentially a version of Ogin, a character played by actress [[Kaoru Yumi]] in ''Mitok\u014dmon Gaiden: Kager\u014d Ninp\u014d-Ch\u014d'', a spinoff series of ''[[Mitok\u014dmon]]''. Having designed Yumi on the spot with the intention of her to be sexy, Watsuki had no specific design model. But halfway through, Watsuki became a fan of [[Morrigan Aensland]] from ''[[Darkstalkers|Vampire Hunter]]'' and as a result began to expose more and more of Yumi's cleavage and shoulders, \"eventually increasing the sexiness by about 120%.\" Admitting that he has always had trouble drawing women, Watsuki stated that drawing Yumi taught him that he could have fun while drawing female characters not just by making them appear \"cute,\" but also by making them \"seductive, or even evil.\" He added that, since Yumi had a \"sexed-up body,\" botching even one line could make the character appear \"downright indecent.\" Watsuki stated that in this way, Yumi taught him the importance of skillful sketching.<ref name=\"YumiProfile\">[[Nobuhiro Watsuki|Watsuki, Nobuhiro]]. \"The Secret Life of Characters (40) Komagata Yumi,\" ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' Volume 17.

H\u014dji envisions Japan as a mighty power led by Shishio, ruling with the principles of basic animal survival. Although he is not proficient in any fighting style, he is a cunning organizer and possesses formidable leadership qualities. He manages to acquire firearms on the black market and purchases the gigantic [[ironclad warship]]\u2014{{nihongo|''Rengoku''|\u7149\u7344||\"Purgatory\"}} without anyone knowing.{{gnr|ch|76|, |99}} H\u014dji's plan with the Rengoku fails when Sanosuke blows it up with bombs. H\u014dji disagrees with Shishio using the Juppongatana to fight Himura Kenshin, believing they might lose, putting their actual goal to overthrow the government in jeopardy.{{gnr|ch|76}} But he strongly believes in Shishio's strength, even throwing away a gun he had hidden after Shishio and Kenshin's fight surpasses Shishio's fifteen-minute timelimit.{{gnr|ch|141}} He is in utter disbelief when Shishio finally loses upon bursting into flames and destroys Shishio's hideout in an attempt to kill Kenshin and company rather than accept his master's defeat.{{gnr|ch|146}} He is saved by [[#Y\u016bky\u016bzan Anji|Anji]] and then surrenders himself to the police, not for penance but to use the trial to project Shishio's ideals and plans.{{gnr|ch|146}} However, he is never given a trial and, although he was offered a government job should he pledge loyalty to it, H\u014dji commits suicide in his cell; using his blood to write a final message detailing his disgust with the regime: \"The world is dead to me. I go to serve my lord in Hell.\"{{gnr|ch|148}} In Hell, H\u014dji is reunited with Shishio and vows to continue following him in his new quest to conquer Hell.{{gnr|ch|148}}\n\nWatsuki stated that most of the overall concept for H\u014dji originates from a character in ''X-Men'', whose name sounds similar to H\u014dji's<!--Don't specify which one it is without a reliable source-->; the ''X-Men'' character gave him a \"hint\" for the story but not H\u014dji's personality. The ''X-Men'' character does not directly fight but instead invents machines to help his team members, so Watsuki wanted a character who held a support role in the Juppongatana. At first H\u014dji was just an individual who was surprised a lot, but Watsuki realized that would \"get awfully dull.\" When he decided to look at H\u014dji as Shishio's \"Number Two\" man (like [[Hijikata Toshiz\u014d]] and Shokatsury\u014d K\u014dmei) it \"strummed the chords of [his] heart,\" and ideas came one after another until H\u014dji became one of his favorite characters. Watsuki stated that H\u014dji's character design is \"100% original\" to him and that it is one of which he is the most confident in. Watsuki added that the one aspect he did not like about H\u014dji is his costume; he had wanted to make it more like the \"European style authentic\" to the time period, but could not find any resources. The author revealed that by the end of the Kyoto arc, H\u014dji would become \"a pretty cool guy.\"<ref>[[Nobuhiro Watsuki|Watsuki, Nobuhiro]]. \"The Secret Life of Characters (33) Sadojima H\u014dji,\" ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' Volume 13.

However, he had difficulty in determining what Anji's backstory would be and whether he would be a friend or foe, so he put Anji in \"storage\" until his ultimate introduction. Having determined that Sanosuke needed to become more powerful, Watsuki introduced Anji as a counterpart to Sanosuke's fighting style, so that he could give Sanosuke a strong opponent and increase Sanosuke's power at the same time. Watsuki had no model for Anji's personality, but pictured him as being similar to Shinsengumi lieutenant Shimada Kai due to the \"manly air.\" He also said that Anji is his second attempt at \"manly intelligence,\" following the \"failed\" Isurugi Raij\u016bta. Anji's visual model originates from the lead vocalist of a punk band called Angie, and his name originates from the band's as well. Watsuki said that their bandannas on shaved heads and the black makeup under the eyes looks \"cool\" but still gives an impression suggesting intelligence.

An assistant from Kansai checked Ch\u014d's accent, but Watsuki had it \"broken down\" so that everyone from Japan can understand it; meaning Ch\u014d's Kansai accent differs from the actual one. Watsuki created Ch\u014d's basic design when he was 20 years old; originally designed to be a space alien. While Watsuki did not use the alien aspect, he said the \"horse-headed monkey-face\" was \"hard to throw out completely,\" so he used it for Ch\u014d. The original design had black, \"messy\" hair swept back, but he gave Ch\u014d a \"[[punk rock]]\" quality to give the character more impact as the first Juppongatana member shown. Despite being a villain, Ch\u014d was a popular character with ''Rurouni Kenshin'' readers; Watsuki said that characters with Kansai dialects are \"''always'' pretty popular.\" Because he also enjoyed drawing Ch\u014d, the author felt it would be \"a waste\" to \"finish off\" Ch\u014d after the conclusion of the Iori story and therefore had him reappear at later points.

Equal to S\u014djir\u014d in strength, he is the member most feared by Shishio.{{gnr|ch|93}} Before the revolution, he was a swordsman working for the [[Shogun]] as an anti-''hitokiri''. In a fight against Shishio, he was blinded in both eyes and has trained to take revenge ever since.{{gnr|ch|93}} Usui and Shishio made a deal upon him joining the Juppongatana; Usui can try to kill Shishio anytime he gets the chance.{{gnr|ch|93}} A native of the [[Ryukyu Islands]], Usui fights using a short spear with a weighted end - the ''[[Tinbe-Rochin|rochin]]'' - to attack, and a [[tortoise]] shell - the ''[[Tinbe-Rochin|tinbei]]'' - as a shield to deflect attacks and block the enemy's vision.{{gnr|ch|114}} He possesses the {{nihongo|''Shingan''|\u5fc3\u773c||[[mind's eye]]}}, which is actually [[superhuman]] hearing that lets him hear another's heartbeat, muscle contractions and bone friction thus enabling him to read their emotions and physical position.{{gnr|ch|113}} Usui dies when his body is ripped in half by Sait\u014d's attack.{{gnr|ch|114}}\n\nUsui originated from a chat Watsuki had with one of his assistants who proposed a blind swordsman. Although originally not interested in the idea, Watsuki decided to go with it after discussing the Shingan ability that read people's emotions by listening to their heartbeat and pulse. The original plan was to have Usui fight Kenshin right after he fought Ch\u014d - chasing him down in the city in a manner similar to the [[Terminator (character concept)|Terminator]]; but the plot went in a different direction, with Usui fighting and dying at the hands of Sait\u014d. Watsuki did state that the Terminator-like character he did not use would be showing up after the Kyoto arc. The author said that he regretted creating Usui, like he regretted creating Raij\u016bta, but that Usui became more popular and therefore \"that must also mean\" Usui is stronger. The model for Usui's design is [[Taopaipai]] from ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' by [[Akira Toriyama]]; Watsuki said that as the first villain to defeat [[Goku|Son Goku]], Taopaipai made \"a strong impression.\" As for the \"eyeball-covered costume,\" Watsuki originally planned to give Usui a plain \"tribal\" outfit, but scratched that idea after seeing the \"[[List of Angels in Neon Genesis Evangelion#Matarael|spider-like angel]]\" in ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]''. He originally planned to make Usui a \"handsome, long-haired type,\" but when he saw a rough sketch of the concept, it looked too much like Uky\u014d from ''[[Samurai Shodown|Samurai Spirits]]''<!--SamuSupi -> Samurai Spirits -> Samurai Shodown-->, so he started over.

Watsuki used ideas from assistants to create many of the Juppongatana and Kamatari was one he seized immediately, but when coming up with the specifics, the concept \"just wasn't coming together.\" In the beginning some of his ideas were \"male-appearing on the surface, but personality-wise, will be feminine,\" \"A very erotic and seductive, womanly appearance from the outside, but a manly man on the inside,\" and \"a big macho gay guy.\" But a friend of Watsuki's suggested to make Kamatari \"just a 'pretty girl' type,\" leading to the solidification of the character. Watsuki planned for Kamatari to have a \"light-hearted and cheerful\" personality, but found complications when a \"more serious side\" began to emerge, leading him to feel some regret with the outcome; he admitted that one of his bad habits is to cross the fine line between \"serious\" and \"depressing\". Watsuki added that the next time he will use the character, he will try to \"keep his outlook sunny\" while not compromising the \"essential self.\" Watsuki used [[Ikari Yui]] from ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'' as the visual model for Kamatari's face; but colored the hair black<!--Even though the anime doesn't use black, keep in mind the manga is only white and black-->, exposed more of the forehead, and had the back of Kamatari's hair \"flip out as I've seen so many high-schoolers do these days.\" Watsuki found that the character's triangular silhouette has influences from [[Hsien-Ko|Rei-Rei]] in ''Vampire Hunter''. The large chain-scythe that Kamatari uses exists in real life, but Watsuki made the blade larger to give it \"a real super-impact look\" and noted that it is not intended to be used in the way that Kamatari does.<ref name=\"Kamataripage\">[[Nobuhiro Watsuki|Watsuki, Nobuhiro]]. \"The Secret Life of Characters (37) Honj\u014d Kamatari,\" ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' Volume 15.

His battle technique is called {{nihongo|Fire Flight|\u98db\u7a7a\u767a\u7834|Hiku Happa}}, in which he uses [[dynamite]] to lift himself into flight and attack from above with a blade on his arm before blowing himself back into the air.{{gnr|ch|122}} The power of flight is harnessed thanks to Henya starving himself to extreme [[emaciation]]; he is so light that the constant uplift from the explosions can easily keep him in the air with the wings.{{gnr|ch|12}} Yahiko defeats Henya by gliding on a [[sh\u014dji]] door blown up by Henya's dynamite and attacking him from above.{{gnr|ch|122}} Henya is pardoned for his crimes and used as an army spy in Asia by the government because of his aviation abilities.{{gnr|ch|147}}\n\nHenya was modeled after Matsubayashi Henyasai, a swordsman in the early [[Edo period]] who possessed \"avoidance techniques,\" which would now be called [[acrobatics]] in the modern era. Watsuki revealed that he originally planned to introduce Henya as a [[tengu]] during the Megumi arc as part of the Oniwabansh\u016b, but that story was \"not as well-planned as it otherwise might have been,\" so the chance was lost and Henya had to become one of the Juppongatana. It was originally planned for Henya to engage in a mid-air battle with Kenshin, but Watsuki felt that Kenshin had become too strong after learning the secret ''Hiten Mitsurugi-ry\u016b'' technique, so Yahiko became his opponent instead. Henya's design model was a bat with a streamlined head and \"a little bit\" of [[List of Cyborg 009 characters##00 Cyborgs|Cyborg 002]] from ''[[Cyborg 009]]''. The author intended for Henya to be \"monster-like\" since, originally none of the Juppongatana aside from S\u014djir\u014d were supposed to be \"lookers.\" Watsuki reported that some people felt that Henya was \"''still'' too good-looking,\" so he made his body \"super-emaciated.\" He said that [[Freak (Image Comics)|Freak]] from ''[[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]]'' was also a reference for Henya.<ref name=\"Henyaprofile\">[[Nobuhiro Watsuki|Watsuki, Nobuhiro]]. \"The Secret Life of Characters (36) Hariwa Henya,\" ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' Volume 15.

Despite defeating four members of the Kyoto Oniwabansh\u016b by himself, Iwanb\u014d flees when Henya and Kamatari are defeated.{{gnr|ch|124}} After Shishio's defeat, Ch\u014d remarks that Iwanb\u014d is too stupid to do anything on his own.{{gnr|ch|148}} Iwanb\u014d is later shown to be a [[karakuri puppet]] controlled from the inside by [[#Gein|Gein]].{{gnr|ch|152}} Gein uses the new Iwanb\u014d Version Three, Savage Mode to fight Kenshin during the [[#Six Comrades|Six Comrades]]' attack on Kamiya dojo.{{gnr|ch|187}} This version has detachable unrestricted joints, allowing every limb to move in any direction, and anti-piercing armor of woven steel protecting Gein inside.{{gnr|ch|188|, |190}} It is defeated when Kenshin lodges debris in its internal gears to stop its offense, and then destroyed by his strongest technique.{{gnr|ch|191}}\n\nFollowing having a \"giant\" in the Juppongatana (Fuji), Iwanb\u014d was created as a \"full body costume.\" Although Watsuki admitted he might have included too many elements from the Kyoto arc in the Jinch\u016b arc, he said he enjoyed the character of Iwanb\u014d. Because he had to hide the fact that it was just a costume, the author portrayed Version One as a very mysterious character, but the design kept changing and he became a \"weird, but likable personality.\" Version Two was not intended to appear, but because Gein broke Version One, Watsuki had to \"cut and paste\" and utilized this in the story later. Version Three had to fight Kenshin and therefore was made into a \"powerful suit.\" The author reflected that after all this, he seems to have gotten carried away, making Iwanb\u014d feel out of place in the ''Rurouni Kenshin'' universe. The design models for Version One (and Two) were the characters [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] and [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]] from ''X-Men''. But elements of [[Victor von Gerdenheim|Victor]] and [[Sasquatch (Darkstalkers)|Sasquatch]] from ''Vampire Hunter'' were also incorporated, making him \"cuter.\" The design model for Version Three was the comic book character [[Hulk]], specifically the version that was on ''Marvel X'', a small booklet included in an issue of ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' in relation to ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]''. Version Three's full body tattoo was added to give him the look of a \"battling tribe\" from an undeveloped world, but Watsuki said it does not look that good.<ref>[[Nobuhiro Watsuki|Watsuki, Nobuhiro]]. \"The Secret Life of Characters (43) Iwanb\u014d (Versions One-Three,\" ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' Volume 22.

Saizuchi's talents lie not in battle-abilities, but his proficient use of words. Having taken Fuji in after he was nearly killed, Saizuchi reminds Fuji that he has to repay him.{{gnr|ch|126}} During the Juppongatana's attack of Aoi-Ya, Saizuchi attempts to destroy the morale of the Oniwabansh\u016b by giving a speech as to why it is impossible for them to defeat Fuji and himself.{{gnr|ch|125}} Saizuchi is knocked unconscious when Fuji's left arm falls on him upon being defeated by [[#Hiko Seij\u016br\u014d|Hiko Seij\u016br\u014d]].{{gnr|ch|127}} Pardoned for his crimes, Saizuchi uses his gifts of persuasion for the Foreign Ministry in secret negotiations.{{gnr|ch|147}}\n\nThe overall model for Saizuchi is a villainous elf who tricks the giant in what Watsuki was told is a Finnish folktale called \"Frost Giant\"; he combined that with an \"image of a giant-robot pilot.\" Originally Watsuki planned for Okina to fight Saizuchi, but he cut the concept because he wanted to maintain the balance of the story and because his \"inner story-editor\" asked him if anyone would really like to see \"two old codgers\" fight each other. The design model is Director-General Luchi of the Akuda Republic from ''Purin Purin Monogatari'', an [[NHK]] [[puppet show]]. Watsuki said that the large size of Director-General Luchi's head would \"freak me out.\" Watsuki commented that Luchi's design was \"efficient\" since one could tell that he was very intelligent at one glance. Watsuki felt that of all the Juppongatana, Saizuchi got the \"short end of the stick\" since the character did not have a chance to fully display what his \"massive brain could do.\" He described this as the \"Senkaku Effect,\" where the characters with the \"best noggins\" are not used to their \"full potential.\"<ref name=\"Saizuchimodel\">[[Nobuhiro Watsuki|Watsuki, Nobuhiro]]. \"The Secret Life of Characters (39) Elder Saizuchi,\" ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' Volume 15.

Considered a freak by everyone around him, one day he was attacked and almost killed but Saizuchi found him and took him in.{{gnr|ch|126}} The gentle, depressed Fuji was in an ideal state for Saizuchi to manipulate his emotions and turn him into an unbelievable fighter. Saizuchi keeps telling Fuji that he owes him for saving his life and uses that to control him.{{gnr|ch|126}} Fuji is easily defeated by Hiko Seij\u016br\u014d, who acknowledges Fuji's samurai soul and was the first to look at Fuji as someone other than a monster.{{gnr|ch|126|, |127}} Pardoned for his crimes, the Meiji government assigns Fuji to Hokkaid\u014d to develop land and act as a defending fighter during times of war.{{gnr|ch|147}}\n\nThe idea for a giant originated from the [[List of Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind characters#God Warriors|God-Soldier]] in the ''[[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (film)|Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind]]'', after Watsuki saw the film. He wondered if it would \"even be interesting\" for Kenshin to fight a giant, but could not let it go and so decided to have Fuji fight Hiko instead. Watsuki revealed that he and his editor both had doubts about actually doing it because Fuji was so big, but friends and assistants told him it would be fun and he was pleased that it seemed to have paid off. Fuji also utilized inspiration from what Watsuki was told is a Finnish folktale called \"Frost Giant\", in which a monster-like giant is revealed to have a heart. The design was inspired by the first [[Evangelion (mecha)|Eva]] in ''Neon Genesis Evangelion''. The face originated from Eva #2, but Watsuki's assistants believed the design looked too similar. So his then-assistant [[Hiroyuki Takei]] created a \"skull-like riff on Eva #1\" and Watsuki added the biting of his helmet's anchor rope feature, finishing Fuji's helmet face. Watsuki tried \"very hard\" to keep the body from being too similar to the Eva. Fuji's actual face originates from Dogura Magura in ''Arabian Lamp-Lamp'' by Takeshi Obata; Watsuki wanted to work with the concept of a \"monstrous character who's still somehow good looking,\" which Watsuki says Dogura Magura is \"the epitome of.\" The author admitted that due to the \"tight\" schedule of the Fuji chapters, he had insufficient time to revise the design, resulting in \"an essentially unoriginal face.\"<ref name=\"Fujipage\">[[Nobuhiro Watsuki|Watsuki, Nobuhiro]]. \"The Secret Life of Characters (38) Fuji (Real Name Unknown),\" ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' Volume 15.

The group agreed to then disband and whoever gets to Kenshin first, gets to kill him.{{gnr|ch|156}} Because many of the Juppongatana were characters that were \"hard to hate,\" Watsuki wanted to make the five comrades (excluding Enishi) in this storyline as \"scum-like\" as possible.

The younger brother of [[#Yukishiro Tomoe|Yukishiro Tomoe]], Enishi seeks revenge against Kenshin for killing his sister fifteen years earlier. In China he taught himself the {{nihongo|''Wat\u014djutsu''|\u502d\u5200\u8853}} style, which was derived from Japanese kenjutsu.{{gnr|ch|202}} He is the head of a black market weapons smuggling organization that he runs with [[#Woo Heishin|Woo Heishin]].\n\n====Gein====\n{{nihongo|Gein|\u5916\u5370}}, the {{nihongo|\"Artist of Karakuri\"|\u6a5f\u5de7\u82b8\u8853\u5bb6}}, is a member of the Six Comrades and the puppeteer behind Juppongatana member [[#Iwanb\u014d|Iwanb\u014d]].{{gnr|ch|152|, |188}} Gein was tasked with assembling the Six Comrades and acquiring them a mansion in [[Yokohama]], while Enishi was still in Shanghai.{{gnr|ch|154}} However, Gein does not actually seek revenge against Kenshin.{{gnr|ch|156}} He is the last remaining descendant of a family who mastered the art of [[Karakuri puppet|karakuri]] in the Middle Ages.{{gnr|ch|188}} He creates puppet-like suits out of human corpses, most notably the Iwanb\u014d series.{{gnr|ch|211}} Gein is actually an old man, yet he is very strong due to controlling his heavy puppets for so long. The diamond edged steel wires he uses, {{nihongo|''Zankosen''|\u65ac\u92fc\u7dda}}, to control his puppets can also be used as a weapon as they are sharp enough to cut flesh and break bone.{{gnr|ch|216}} Gein just wants to test out his creations and needs to be around men of battle to do it since, according to him, the forefront of technology is always in battle.{{gnr|ch|188}} This is also the reason why Gein joined Shishio.{{gnr|ch|188}} During the attack on Kamiya dojo, Gein fights Kenshin by operating a new version of Iwanb\u014d.{{gnr|ch|188}} For Enishi's Jinch\u016b he creates a corpse doll of Kaoru to fool Kenshin into thinking she had been killed by Enishi, he considers this his masterpiece.{{gnr|ch|211}} Having completed his job, Enishi and Woo Heishin both decide to have Gein killed during his return boat ride to Tokyo, but Gein easy kills the large group of martial artists who attack him.{{gnr|ch|214}} When retrieving his Kaoru doll from the graveyard, he runs into a trap set by Aoshi, who knew that the corpse was a fake.{{gnr|ch|215}} Aoshi kills Gein after having him divulge where the real Kaoru is.{{gnr|ch|217}}\n\nGein originated from serial killer [[Ed Gein]]<!--Note: Viz Media's English release incorrectly gives Gein's given name as \"Edgar\".-->, who made lampshades and chairs out of corpses, combined with the puppet master required by the story. Watsuki suggested Gein might have been one of the most popular of the Six Comrades based on the many negative comments he got when he unveiled his face, like he did with [[#Han'nya|Han'nya]]. He wanted to \"challenge a good-looking masked character like [[Char Aznable|Char]] from ''[[Gundam]]''.\" Gein's obsession with functional and physical beauty comes from the author's own. Gein had no model in terms of physical design; his costume mixes the outfits worn by stage crew and a skull mark from his \"necromancer\" image. This minimal \"highlights\" outfit was a successful experiment for Watsuki's next work where he hoped to have fewer highlights to save time.<ref>Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (47) Gein,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 24.

While shown to be a relatively selfless person when first introduced, his nature is later distorted until he reaches the point of insanity. During the Battle of Toba\u2013Fushimi in the Bakumatsu, Kujiranami's right arm was cut off by Kenshin.{{gnr|ch|154}} Kujiranami requested that Kenshin kill him since he did not want to live to see an era where wars are fought with guns instead of swords, absent of skill and soul. However, Kenshin refused, saying that he did not want to kill any more than he needed to and that Kujiranami should live in the new era. Already feeling that he had been robbed of a warrior's pride and era, being robbed of a warrior's death was the last straw for Kujiranami.{{gnr|ch|154}} Since then he vowed to kill Kenshin for dishonoring him and joined the Six Comrades to get his revenge. Enishi gave Kujiranami an [[Armstrong cannon]] to replace his missing arm which Kujiranami uses to blow up the Akabeko and [[#Chief Uramura|Chief Uramura]]'s home.{{gnr|ch|154|, |155|, |161}} During the attack on Kamiya dojo, he is taken down by Sait\u014d and arrested,{{gnr|ch|207}} but later goes berserk in his jail cell and breaks out.{{gnr|ch|218}} He gets the upgraded weapon he received from Enishi, a grenade launcher, and goes on a rampage in Tokyo searching for Kenshin. Yahiko is the only one around to fight Kujiranami at the time and manages to hold him off until Kenshin arrives and cuts off his grenade launcher, which returns his sanity.{{gnr|ch|226}} Afterwards Yahiko manages to convince Kujiranami that his hatred for a fellow samurai is wrong and has done nothing for him except lead him down the wrong path. Moved to tears by Yahiko's words, Kujiranami accepts that he was wrong, apologizes to Kenshin and turns himself back into the police.{{gnr|ch|226}}\n\nThe idea for a one-handed fighter originates from Iba Hachir\u014d, a swordsman from the Bakumatsu. Watsuki originally planned to make Enishi one-handed, but after considering the problems involving a one-handed swordsman facing the skilled Kenshin and deciding that \"boss fights\" should simply involve a sword versus a sword, he made Kujiranami one-handed instead. Kujiranami was going to be the Terminator-like character that Watsuki initially planned for Usui, but the idea was scrapped again due to him and his assistants being exhausted at the time. The design model for Kujiranami is [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] from ''X-Men'', one of Watsuki's favorite villains.

He is the student of [[#Yaminobu|Tatsumi]] who was killed by Kenshin fifteen years ago. Inui does not seek to avenge his master's death, whom he calls a loser, but is using it as an excuse to fight and prove how powerful he is.{{gnr|ch|159}} He likes to boast about being invincible and undefeated, but Sano figures out that Banjin is full of himself from wearing the gauntlets and that he only fights people weaker than him. Inui attacks [[#Minor characters|Maekawa dojo]] as part of the Jinch\u016b campaign while [[#Otowa Hy\u014dko|Otowa Hy\u014dko]] simultanesouly attacks Chief Uramura's house.{{gnr|ch|158}} During the encounter, Sanosuke wrecks one of his gauntlets with the Mastery of Two Layers.{{gnr|ch|160}} After receiving a pair of upgraded gauntlets from Enishi, the \"Neo-Invulnerable Gauntlets\", he fights Sano again during the attack on Kamiya dojo.{{gnr|ch|186}} In the end Inui provokes Sano into attacking him with the Mastery of Two Layers again and is defeated as a result with both of his gauntlets destroyed.{{gnr|ch|193}} After being taken down, Inui vows to kill Sano next time and Sano welcomes him to try but warns him that he will not win as long as he wears the gauntlets to cover his weakness. Banjin is arrested by the police afterwards.\n\nOriginally considered for the Juppongatana, Inui started as a \"camouflage costume character.\" Then he was going to have army style hand-to-hand combat, but when it was questioned whether or not such a thing existed in this time period, he changed to being a combined martial-arts user, with gauntlets added for uniqueness. His personality is that of a \"very lively idiot\" and is taken from Kazama Kangetsu in ''Samurai Spirits''. Kangetsu was also the design model for the character, specifically the version of Kangetsu that appears at the end of the game. Watsuki said that because a lot of different concepts went into Inui, he looks weird, which the author greatly regrets. He also regrets him looking too much like Kangetsu, and vowed that this would be the last time he uses ''Samurai Spirits'' as a design. However, Watsuki said he likes Inui quite a bit, and would like to create more of these \"stupid types\" in his next work.<ref>Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (44) Inui Banjin,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 22.

The author wanted to make him more cunning and sadistic, but said Otowa was not developed satisfactorily due to his own incompetence. Otowa's design model was a previously rejected \"[[drag queen]]-ish\" villain who wore a lot of lipstick. The six-pronged accessory was borrowed from [[Mister Sinister|Mr. Sinister]] in ''X-Men: Age of Apocalypse''.

His teeth have also been sharpened into fangs from a young age, although his long tongue is natural.{{gnr|ch|197}} Fifteen years earlier, Yatsume took up fighting and joined the [[#Yaminobu|Yaminobu]] in order to support his clan, who had fallen on hard times due to depleted gold mines, by hoping to prove to the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] that their bodies had battle potential.{{gnr|ch|197}} But the Yaminobu were defeated by Kenshin and the Shogunate defeated by the Ishin Shishi. Yatsume wants revenge on Kenshin to uphold the laws of his clan (which state that anyone who sees a member of their clan must be killed) and for the misfortunes of his clan, which he blames on the Ishin Shishi and Kenshin.{{gnr|ch|196|, |197}} Before he can fight Kenshin however, he ends up fighting Sait\u014d instead and is brutally maimed in defeat, despite having managed to outmaneuver the man's trademark attack once.{{gnr|ch|198|, |199}} Kenshin stops Sait\u014d from killing him and offers to let Yatsume fight him if he still wants to after healing, but suggests that he go up north and use his abilities to help his clan.{{gnr|ch|199}} He is arrested by the police afterwards.\n\nYatsume's model was ''kumo otoko'' (\"Spider Man\"), not the American version, so he has similar roots as Han'nya. Because the \"freaks\" theme did not go so well with Han'nya, Yatsume is Watsuki's second attempt at it. But the author said he was utterly defeated, citing Sait\u014d as the biggest reason; any character turns into a weakling in front of Sait\u014d, just like Usui did. Watsuki said that the body shaping is one of the ideas he likes, but seems a little unfitting for a shonen manga. Because body deformation is a very sensitive issue, he had to be careful how he dealt with it, which might have detracted from the storyline as a whole. He stated that there would be no further attempts at the freaks theme because he has come to the belief that there needs to be more \"positive themes\" in shonen manga; but will still use it in terms of design. Watsuki admitted that the design model is all \"jumbled up.\" The silhouette version of Yatsume, seen before his full reveal, was modeled after the \"bandana mask version\" of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] from ''X-Men'' and [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] from ''[[Spider-Man]]''. After being told by various people to \"do Spider-Man, or to do Spawn and such,\" Watsuki got agitated and said \"I'll throw in [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] also!,\" which he referred to as digging his own grave. The gold-mining clan backstory was added after the fact, but Yatsume still ended up sticking out from the time period.<ref>Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (46) Yatsume Mumy\u014di,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 23.

He possesses no true fighting skills and is guarded by the [[#S\u016b-shin|S\u016b-shin]], who are skilled in various fighting styles.{{gnr|ch|238}} In exchange for being allowed to use the organization's resources for his personal Jinch\u016b campaign, Enishi agreed to hand over total control of it to Heishin.{{gnr|ch|214}} After receiving control, Heishin tries to have the S\u016b-shin take Enishi's revenge by killing Kenshin.{{gnr|ch|237}} But all four are defeated by Kenshin's comrades, while Heishin is beaten up by Enishi. He later recovers and begins shooting with dual revolvers before being beaten up by Enishi again, but when Enishi is about to kill Heishin, Kenshin stops him.{{gnr|ch|250}}\n\nWatsuki had no model for Heishin. He created him after his editor told Watsuki that he needed to put more depth into the black market weapons organization. Since the organization was made simply to explain Enishi's finances, Watsuki believed that the addition of Heishin \"didn't seem to change anything.\" The author felt that chapters flew by and he was unable to set Heishin's personality, so he became \"this pathetic creature.\" Even though Heishin was his favorite \"#2,\" he became an unattractive character and Watsuki regretted how he turned out. Heishin also had no design model; he was designed around the time of the Tomoe chapters when Watsuki was aiming for originality and creating characters that did not obviously look like any other. Heishin was designed to be \"heavy\" on black to contrast with the \"whiteness\" of Enishi.<ref>Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (52) Woo Heishin,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 27.

Because they were \"irresponsibly made,\" he initially named them the \"Four Stars\", but changed it to the \"Four Gods\" and individually named them after the four godly beasts. He realized this and tried to fix the dialogue but it \"got weird\" and the fights were not as glamorous as he had hoped. This made him realize how important it is to decide the scenes and plot in advance. The S\u016b-shin had no design models either; it was simply an easy to draw design and making them quadruplets in Chinese clothes without any tone.

When Hiko was placed in ''Rurouni Kenshin'', the author simplified the design, such as changing the hair to make it easier to draw. Watsuki said that Hiko's body became \"more macho\" because he is a different kind of ''Hiten Mitsurugi-ry\u016b'' swordsman and because of the addition of \"manliness.\" At the time, Watsuki said that he was fascinated by images of \"manliness\" and that Hiko is one of the first characters to reflect this fascination. His cloak originates from the American comic book series ''Spawn''. As one of his favorite characters, Watsuki wanted to use Hiko more often, but because he is more powerful than Kenshin, it was too difficult to find a place to use him in the story.<ref name=\"Hikodev\">Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (32) Hiko Seij\u016br\u014d,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 12.

The author said he did not realize that because cool beauties do not show emotion, once she revealed her true feelings in the end, she become a completely different character. He also pointed out that her death is the same as Yumi's.

He said that Tae was his first character to evolve in this manner and he would like it to continue to surprise himself.

The storyline was created to act as a bridge to the Raij\u016bta one and to give Yahiko the spotlight. The concept of \"a young girl being a young man's motivation to act\" introduced her as the heroine. The author used Tsubame as a \"testament\" of the \"wrong thinking of a previous age\" and gave her a manner that contrasts with Yahiko's \"acts-before-he-thinks\" manner. Her design model originated from a popular \"planet-themed\" anime series, particularly its character symbolized by the \"ringed-planet.\" As Tsubame is \"an average girl\" the author decided that her hair should either be in a bowl cut or in pigtails, and after watching that anime he decided on a bowl cut.<ref>Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (15) Sanj\u014d Tsubame,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 5.

A cunning, but bottom-ranked onmitsu,{{gnr|ch|17}} Beshimi received no prosperous government job offers because of his physical competency in only one skill.{{gnr|ch|28}} His favorite weapons are spiral darts, with which he poisons Yahiko. He is gunned down by Kanry\u016b's Gatling gun trying to help save Aoshi.{{gnr|ch|28}} In the anime only, one of his darts jams Kanry\u016b's Gatling gun. Watsuki stated that Beshimi was \"largely created on-the-spot\" and does not have a motif. He said that without a personality set for him, the character turned out \"kind of timid.\" Not originally intended to be a standalone character, Beshimi became shorter than Kenshin to add variety to the Oniwabansh\u016b. Watsuki said that Beshimi's shortness and timidness gave him a group of fans who wrote to him calling the character \"cute.\"<ref name=\"WatsukiBeshimi\"/>\n\n====Hyottoko====\n{{Anime voices|[[Sh\u014dz\u014d Iizuka]]|[[Bob Papenbrook]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|Hyottoko|\u706b\u7537}} is the large and fat member of the Oniwabansh\u016b. A mid-ranked omnitsu, Hyottoko breathes fire at his opponents by means of a large oil bag he keeps stored in his stomach with a nozzle coming out of his mouth, that he ignites by using his false teeth of flint.{{gnr|ch|17}} Hyottoko received no prosperous government job offers because he had competency in one skill.{{gnr|ch|28}} Hyottoko dies while charging for Kanry\u016b as an unsuccessful decoy for Beshimi.{{gnr|ch|28}} Watsuki said he had no particular motif while designing Hyottoko; using his rudimentary [[kanji]] knowledge (the name Hyottoko is formed by the kanji for \"Fire\" and \"Man\"), he created a fire-breather. The creator made Hyottoko fat since he wanted the Oniwabansh\u016b to represent several shapes and sizes and because the character would have a bag of oil in his stomach. Watsuki said that since he had never drawn a figure like that before, he went through several designs until he found one he could draw comfortably and repeatedly. Watsuki decided to give Hyottoko the ability to breathe fire, because he felt it would be natural for an \"onmitsu\" to be \"flashy.\" Looking back, the author saw the character as somewhat out of place and \"not really organic\" to his world. According to Watsuki the fire breathing and Kenshin's sword spinning method to defeat Hyottoko's fire-breathing received criticism from fans, authors of [[d\u014djinshi]] [[fanzine]]s, and personal friends. The author described Hyottoko as \"the guy who makes a big entrance and then gets just as spectacularly beaten,\" whose \"ridiculously confident\" and \"a bit of an idiot\", but that that is just the \"natural evolution of the character, I guess.\"<ref name=\"HyottokoProfile\"/>\n\n====Han'nya====\n{{Anime voices|[[Akio Nojima]]|[[Tom Wyner]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|Han'nya|\u822c\u82e5|[[Hannya]]}} is a skilled martial artist and was the master of intelligence for the Edo Castle Oniwabansh\u016b.{{gnr|ch|23}} In the poor village he was born in, it is common to abandon a child at birth to reduce the number of people to feed. Han'nya survived and wandered around like an animal until Aoshi found him and trained him to be an Oniwabansh\u016b.{{gnr|ch|24}} Thus he is extremely loyal to Aoshi, giving his life to allow Kenshin enough time to retrieve his sword to defeat Kanry\u016b and save Aoshi.{{gnr|ch|28}} His arms have horizontal stripes painted on them, which gives them the appearance of being shorter than they actually are, thus luring opponents into a false sense of security regarding distance of attacks.{{gnr|ch|23}} He also wears steel gauntlets beneath his gloves, which help him to block attacks from other weapons.{{gnr|ch|23}} These gauntlets contain retractable steel claws, which he will resort to as a sort of trump card.{{gnr|ch|24}} Han'nya is also the master of disguise within the group; he gained his ability by removing all his prominent facial features, which is why he wears the demonic mask on his face. Han'nya burned his lips, cut off his ears and nose, and crushed his cheekbones so he could disguise himself as any individual.{{gnr|ch|24}} After the Bakumatsu, Han'nya received no prosperous government job offers because of his appearance.{{gnr|ch|28}}\n\nWatsuki was originally going to base Han'nya off of the \"[[Joseph Merrick|Elephant Man]]\"; intending for his face to be deformed because a person stepped on it while he was still in his mother's womb.<ref name=\"Han'nya\">Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (10) Oniwabansh\u016b \u25cf Han'nya,\" ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' Volume 4.

Han'nya would join the Oniwabansh\u016b, becoming a tragic figure who finds his [[wikt:raison d'\u00eatre|raison d'\u00eatre]] in fighting, saying \"Only in the Oniwabansh\u016b am I able to live as a human being.\" Watsuki and his editor discussed how this could be interpreted meaning \"the shape of one's destiny is determined by how one is born\" and whether or not this would be appropriate for a young men's magazine. Watsuki decided a change needed to be made and said that for him Han'nya was a difficult character as it made him aware of the responsibilities of writing for young people. Han'nya's personality is derived from [[Yamazaki Susumu]], a member of the Shinsengumi. Some readers proposed that Han'nya had a handsome face under his mask, was Aoshi's ''[[kagemusha]]'' (such as his twin brother), or was a ''[[kunoichi]]''. The design model for Han'nya was a human skeleton.

Aoshi gave Shikij\u014d a chance to join the Oniwabansh\u016b and gain strength using their training methods and medicines.{{gnr|ch|25}} Shikij\u014d received no prosperous government job offers because he was a traitor.{{gnr|ch|28}} Shikij\u014d is mainly a hand-to-hand fighter but he also swings around a large ball and chain. He fights Sagara Sanosuke at Takeda Kanry\u016b's mansion and is defeated. He is the first to die at Kanry\u016b's hand, protecting Aoshi from the Gatling gun.{{gnr|ch|28}} Watsuki said that he modeled Shikij\u014d after Sanosuke by giving Shikij\u014d the same philosophy, strength, and personality. By putting them on opposite sides Watsuki intended to illustrate the differences between the two factions. Watsuki created Shikij\u014d as a complete villain, but said that the \"noble manner\" of his death made the character \"a pretty cool guy.\" The author used no specific model for Shikij\u014d's design; giving him many muscles as the character is a \"power fighter,\" but feeling that Shikij\u014d was not sufficiently \"strange-enough looking,\" Watsuki added scars and \"superhero-like exaggerated musculature.\"<ref name=\"Shikij\u014d\"/>\n\n====Okina====\n{{Anime voices|[[Koichi Kitamura]]|[[Michael McConnohie]] (TV Series), Marty Fleck (''New Kyoto Arc'')}}\n\n{{nihongo|Kashiwazaki Nenji|\u67cf\u5d0e \u5ff5\u81f3}}, also known as {{nihongo|Okina|\u7fc1}}, was a member of the Oniwabansh\u016b during the Bakumatsu. Sent to Kyoto to set up an information network, the Aoi-Ya inn became his headquarters.{{gnr|ch|74}} Although old, Okina still possesses a quick mind and knows all that goes on in Kyoto as the old intelligence network is still active.{{gnr|ch|74}} Okina was expected to become the next leader of the Oniwabansh\u016b but refused the position, saying that it was the time for the younger generation, and recommended Aoshi.{{gnr|ch|75}} He uses his network to help Kenshin find [[#Arai Family|Arai Seik\u016b]] and Hiko Seij\u016br\u014d.{{gnr|ch|74}} When Aoshi allows Shishio's men to attack Aoi-Ya, Okina challenges him to a duel for forgetting the dignity of the Oniwabansh\u016b and becoming just another killer.{{gnr|ch|88}} Okina tends to like drinking games and pretty girls.

Watsuki supposes that a bit of the character Kohei from [[Sh\u014dtar\u014d Ikenami]]'s ''Kenkyaku Sh\u014dbai'' is in Okina. The author said that he likes Okina since as a character he was able to \"tie up loose ends.\" Okina's design model is Tokijir\u014d Kaiz\u014d from Takeshi Obata's ''Cyborg Jii-chan G''. Watsuki said that while he was careful to not make Okina look too similar to his influence, his assistants guessed the design model right away. He expressed disappointment with Okina's hair; he intended for it to stand up when Okina is very angry, making him resemble \"Sally's dad from the anime.\" Because of a lack of available pages, Watsuki concluded \"this hasn't ended up coming across too well.\"<ref>[[Nobuhiro Watsuki|Watsuki, Nobuhiro]]. \"The Secret Life of Characters (31) Okina (Kashiwazaki Nenji),\" ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' Volume 11.

When Kenshin falls into a deep depression after he believes that he had failed to protect Kaoru from being killed by Enishi, Geezer gently persuades Kenshin (partly through the use of ''[[Prunus mume|hakubaik\u014d]]'' perfume) to find his purpose to stand again rather than listen to his friends telling him to avenge Kaoru, who mean well but lack the insight to realize what Kenshin's inner conflict is. He is then revealed to be the father of Yukishiro Tomoe and Enishi.{{gnr|ch|225}} He is aware that Tomoe has died and that Kenshin was her husband. Geezer is last seen with the broken Enishi in the Fallen Village; father and son remark that each other looks familiar, though it is left unknown whether either knows their connection.{{gnr|ch|251}}\n\nWatsuki based Geezer off of an empty milk can who is a character in \"Now go, Robot!,\" a story by Makoto \u014cishi. The motif of the entire plotline involving Kenshin in the Fallen Village is based on that same story, with it also taking influence from the comic ''[[Silver Surfer]]'' by [[Jean Giraud|Moebius]]. Watsuki used no design model for Geezer. He was created simply based on the attributes; homeless, \"an unusual personality,\" and not easily showing his true thoughts. Afterwards, Watsuki noticed that Geezer was very similar to Grandpa Bob in ''B\u00f8y'' by [[Haruto Umezawa]].<ref>Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (48) Geezer,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 25.

Yutar\u014d feels that his father's actions degrade him and wants to show him how a true samurai lives by the sword.{{gnr|ch|38}} The Tsukayama family was deceived by Isurugi Raij\u016bta, who faked a robbery so the Tsukayama family would pay him to teach Yutar\u014d how to use swords.{{gnr|ch|41}} Yutar\u014d trains at Kamiya dojo a little and becomes My\u014djin Yahiko's rival, the two gaining a mutual desire to become better than the other. When Raij\u016bta initiates a failed sneak attack on Kenshin's group, he accidentally slices Yutar\u014d's right arm so that the nerves are severed, therefore making Yutar\u014d unable to hold a sword with that hand.{{gnr|ch|41}} Yuzaemon takes Yutar\u014d to Germany to get medical treatment. Before he leaves, however, Yahiko confronts him, scorns his sulking, and tells him that he can overcome his sorrow by working to be better than he imagined Raijuta to be. Yutaro responds that he will never stop practicing swordsmanship and his left arm is still enough to become great.{{gnr|ch|44}} At the end of the series, Yutar\u014d's name is listed as one of the acting instructors of the ''Kamiya Kasshin-ry\u016b'' dojo, along with Yahiko.{{gnr|ch|255}}\n\nIn the anime Yutar\u014d's father, a well-known swordsman, is dead. Yutar\u014d, who had inherited a lot of money after his parents died, wishes to learn swordsmanship to become as skilled as his father. When he sees Kenshin, he demands lessons on how to use a sword, but Kenshin refuses. Yutar\u014d finds Raij\u016bta, who plans to overthrow the Meiji government. During a scuffle one of Raij\u016bta's men accidentally hits Yutar\u014d, causing him to fall into the ocean. After Kenshin rescues him Yutaro gets to know Kenshin's group. In a similar manner Raij\u016bta injures Yutar\u014d's right arm, and Yutar\u014d goes to Germany for medical treatment.\n\nWatsuki created Yutar\u014d as Yahiko's rival with no real model; while they both want to be stronger, their desires come the complete opposite places. He gave Yutar\u014d the traits of admiring Kaoru, an older woman, and Kenshin's strength but made him unable to \"be honest\" about it because they were Raij\u016bta's enemies, as aspects of his youth. Watsuki said that Yutar\u014d is one of the \"good guys\" but because he was \"brought down a bit\" by the author's \"most disgraceful character\" (Raij\u016bta) he may not have been developed \"to his full extent.\" Yutar\u014d's design is also the opposite of Yahiko. Watsuki initially had difficulty with his hair, but once he got used to it, it became easy and he enjoyed drawing it. He also had difficulty in compensating for Yutar\u014d's black-less design on the page, which if he was not careful, would go all white.<ref>Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (17) Tsukayama Yutar\u014d,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 6.

He asks Kenshin to go to Kyoto and kill Shishio for the sake of the country.{{gnr|ch|55}} Returning a week later for Kenshin's answer, \u014ckubo is assassinated by Seta S\u014djir\u014d with seven [[Ishikawa Prefecture]] samurai taking responsibility.{{gnr|ch|56}}\n\nWatsuki feels that many Japanese people have bias towards [[Saig\u014d Takamori]] with \u014ckubo being thought of as \"sly\" and \"cunning.\" The author expressed disappointment in this and instead stated that while \u014ckubo was indeed a strategist during the Bakumatsu, he was ethical during the Meiji era and did not try to enrich himself personally through politics (like Saig\u014d did). Watsuki feels that \u014ckubo, who had been demonized during his time period, is an example of what a politician should be and needs more appreciation from the population. For his design, Watsuki wanted to use portrait photographs of \u014ckubo, but could not find them. So he tried using a statue as a model, but believes that the final product does not look at all similar to the statue. In retrospect he believes that the character resembles [[President of the United States]] [[Abraham Lincoln]], another historical figure that Watsuki has respect for.<ref>Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (22) \u014ckubo Toshimichi,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 7.

The author said that Kenji exists solely to be the son of Kenshin and Kaoru, and even though the character was \"clich\u00e9\", he felt that Kenji had to appear.

After Kenshin buries his bombs, Tsukioka stops painting and starts his own newspaper to report the government's wrongdoings.{{gnr|ch|47}} However, he still makes bombs solely as protection and gave several to Sanosuke just before he followed Kenshin to Kyoto.{{gnr|ch|58|, |101}} In the anime series, he becomes a valuable source of information for Kenshin and Sanosuke, serving as their intelligence source during the Feng Shui arc.\n\nWatsuki said that Tsunan originated from a fake advertisement within the series, labeled \"Mysterious Artist Appears.\" When he decided to do the extra Sanosuke chapters he created a \"comrade from the Sekih\u014d Army \u2014 lone explosive expert plotting overthrow of the government.\" But felt that this alone did not give Tsunan \"interesting\" qualities, so he added the \"fake artist\" trait. Due to exhaustion and scheduling issues, the arc became three chapters instead of the planned four and Watsuki said some parts did not get fully developed as a result. The author expressed a desire to use Tsunan at a later point in the series since he is the sole character with a \"mass media\" connection and therefore could have further uses. Despite the fact that Tsunan is \"a little depressing,\" Watsuki likes Tsunan's \"straightforward personality.\" Tsunan had no design model. Due to a lack of time Watsuki adapted an earlier concept of a man with dreadlocks, which \"to my surprise, turned out to be just right.\" After making some \"tweaks\" the design assembled \"quickly,\" with the [[bandanna]] and the \"oddly patterned\" jacket added to give him \"artist-y\" clothing.<ref name=\"TsunanDesign\">[[Nobuhiro Watsuki|Watsuki, Nobuhiro]]. \"The Secret Life of Characters (19) Tsukioka Tsunan,\" ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' Volume 6.

Eiji tries to kill the unconscious Senkaku with a sword, but Sait\u014d stops him so the police can question Senkaku.{{gnr|ch|71}} When Eiji insists that Senkaku needs to be killed for his family's honor, Kenshin tells him that his dead family wants him to be happy, not for him to kill someone. Sait\u014d arranges for his wife, Tokio (\u6642\u5c3e), to care for Eiji in the near future.{{gnr|ch|71}} Watsuki created Eiji between the tragedy in Shingetsu village and the concept of a new beginning, and with the main theme of revenge. In retrospect, the author said that the plot pulled Eiji around and therefore could not develop as a character. Watsuki felt the design looked too similar to Yahiko.<ref>[[Nobuhiro Watsuki|Watsuki, Nobuhiro]]. \"The Secret Life of Characters (27) Mishima Eiji,\" ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' Volume 9.

As a child soldier underneath S\u014dz\u014d, Sanosuke looked up to him greatly; hence he took S\u014dz\u014d's family name as his own and became Sagara Sanosuke.{{gnr|ch|7}} Supporters of the revolution, the Sekih\u014d Army traveled the countryside spreading news about the upcoming change of regime, such as tax cuts. The Meiji government could not keep the promise and so used the Sekih\u014d Army as scapegoats, denouncing them as a \"false army.\"{{gnr|ch|7}} S\u014dz\u014d was decapitated when he reported to the commanding general and his head was placed on a platform in a cage for all to see,{{gnr|ch|7}} haunting Sanosuke for many years and causing his embitterment towards the Meiji government. In the anime, S\u014dz\u014d died of fatal gunshot wounds while protecting Sanosuke.\n\nAlthough a historical figure, Watsuki's own mental image of Sagara S\u014dz\u014d ended up taking precedence; according to the author, S\u014dz\u014d genuinely wanted equality for Japan's people. With him being depicted within the framework of Sanosuke's memories, S\u014dz\u014d ends up being glorified in the story. Watsuki debated whether to include the Sekih\u014d Army Incident due to its obscurity. But because he believed that it exposed the truths and lies of the Meiji Restoration, he decided to include it. He did say that the series' popularity fell to its lowest point during this storyline, as of ''Rurouni Kenshin'' volume two, but repeated that leaving it out was not an option. With no actual historic photographs of S\u014dz\u014d to use as a design, the character became popular \"in the eyes (and hearts) of female readers.\"<ref name=\"SecretLife5Sagara S\u014dz\u014d\">Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (5) Sagara S\u014dz\u014d,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 2.

Seik\u016b's father {{nihongo|Shakk\u016b|\u8d64\u7a7a}} was the swordsmith who made Kenshin's sakabat\u014d. Kenshin seeks Shakk\u016b out in Kyoto for a replacement and learns he is dead, but that his son is still alive and learned everything he knew. With his sakabat\u014d broken, Kenshin asks Seik\u016b to make a new sword, but Seik\u016b refuses because he wants to live a peaceful life in the Meiji era and does not want to make anymore weapons.{{gnr|ch|75}} Wanting Shakk\u016b's final sword, Sawagej\u014d Ch\u014d kidnaps Iori and uses him as a hostage until Azusa reveals that it was offered to the Hakusan Shrine as a \"godsword.\"{{gnr|ch|77}} With Kenshin about to lose to Ch\u014d without a sword, Seik\u016b entrusts his father's last sword to Kenshin, who immediately uses it to defeat Ch\u014d; to everyone's surprise the sword is also a sakabat\u014d.{{gnr|ch|80|, |81}}\n\nWatsuki said that he had \"lots of different things in my mind\" when he created the family, but that he forgot many of them. He said that Iori symbolizes peace, Seik\u016b demonstrates selfishness demonstrated by fathers, and Azusa \"uh... holds it all together?\" Iori's design originated from \"a fairly famous women's manga involving babies.\" Watsuki said that he created the father and mother \"on the spot.\" Watsuki felt that Seik\u016b's design in the end \"kind of\" looked similar to Takeda Kanry\u016b, and so concluded that the design \"didn't turn out quite right.\" But admitted that he also initially thought Azusa was \"not quite right\" until changing his mind, feeling \"she's a really good character.\" The author added that he found it \"refreshing\" that Azusa is the first female character he designed who shows her entire forehead. Watsuki was planning to have Seik\u016b's family reappear later in the Kyoto arc with Yahiko as the lead character in the story.<ref name=\"Seik\u016bFamilydesign\">[[Nobuhiro Watsuki|Watsuki, Nobuhiro]]. \"The Secret Life of Characters (30) Seik\u016b's Family,\" ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' Volume 10.

His father, {{nihongo|Higashidani Kamishimoemon|\u6771\u8c37 \u4e0a\u4e0b\u30a7\u9580}}, is a farmer adept at fighting with his fists and who has fended off Fud\u014dsawa from taking over the village. {{nihongo|Uki|\u53f3\u559c}} is his younger sister, and {{nihongo|\u014cta|\u592e\u592a}} is his younger brother.{{gnr|ch|229}} Their mother, {{nihongo|Naname|\u83dc\u3005\u82bd}}, died around four years after the birth of \u014cta due to a cold.{{gnr|ch|231}} Uki became protective of her little brother because Sanosuke left them and because her mother died, so she was afraid of losing other family members.{{gnr|ch|234}} As a result, \u014cta was sheltered. After learning about Sanosuke's deeds \u014cta becomes willing to fight. At the end of the series, \u014cta's name is listed as a student at Kaoru's dojo.{{gnr|ch|255}}\n\nWatsuki said that he always had some idea of what Sanosuke's family would be like, and therefore formed the Higashidani family along those concepts. Kamishimoemon is what Sanosuke will be like when he is older, Uki is very \"lively\" and protective of others, and \u014cta is the opposite of Sanosuke, a weak little boy. Watsuki felt that the story was a little unsatisfactory because he was tired from the previous storyline and therefore unable to concentrate. In retrospect, he said he should have chosen either Uki or \u014cta and made it only a three-person family. However, the author said that illustrating the family was fun and that he liked challenging himself with a whole family. Watsuki had no models for the visual designs of the characters. Kamishimoemon originated from a concept of an aged Sanosuke that was considered for the final ''Rurouni Kenshin'' chapter. He described Uki as just a \"modern, easy to draw type.\" \u014cta is a \"typical Watsuki image\" of a weak child from a rural area who has cheeks with circle marks. Watsuki intended for designs that would be drawn quickly, but found it difficult and as they evolved he decided that he needed to study images of real people.<ref>Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (50) Higashidani Family,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 26.

During one raid, some pirates wanted to kidnap Kaoru but Shura did not accept that because of her belief that the Kairyu do not harm woman or children, so she took Kenshin to free Kaoru. Due to Shura's strictness and honor-bound rules, along with the fact that she is a woman, she became very unpopular amongst the crew, with the exception of two, Sarujiro and Iwazo. As a result, the rest of them chose Ginjo, one member who allied with an opium dealer (Senbonya Yohei) they once robbed, as their new leader, and attempted to kill Shura in mutiny after adding firearms in their dealings. Shura returned, and with the help of Kenshin, defeated her wayward crew, and with Sarujiro and Iwazo, she left to the sea, as they were still criminals.

Kenshin wanders the country offering protection and aid to those in need, as atonement for the killings he once committed as an assassin. In Tokyo, he meets a young woman named Kamiya Kaoru, who invites him to live in her dojo despite learning about Kenshin's past. Throughout the series, Kenshin begins to establish relationships with many people, including ex-enemies, while dealing with his fair share of foes, new and old.\n\n===Kamiya Kaoru===\n{{Main|Kamiya Kaoru}}\n{{nihongo|Kamiya Kaoru|\u795e\u8c37 \u85ab}} is the instructor of a kendo school in Tokyo called ''Kamiya Kasshin-ry\u016b''. All of its students leave when a large number of people are killed by someone claiming to be ''Hitokiri Batt\u014dsai'' and a practitioner of ''Kamiya Kasshin-ry\u016b'', damaging her school's reputation. Kaoru is saved from this murderous impostor by the real ''Batt\u014dsai'', Himura Kenshin, now a pacifist wanderer. Kaoru invites Kenshin to stay at her dojo as she notes that he is a gentle person instead of a ''hitokiri''. As the series continues, Kaoru develops strong romantic feelings for Kenshin, who is constantly haunted by his past deeds and believes he does not deserve happiness.\n\n===My\u014djin Yahiko===\n{{Main|My\u014djin Yahiko}}\n{{nihongo|My\u014djin Yahiko|\u660e\u795e \u5f25\u5f66}} is an orphan from a [[samurai]] family who was forced to work as a [[pickpocket]] to repay the debt he had presumably owed, as his parents died before they could repay it. When he is rescued by Himura Kenshin, he decides that he will grow up to be just like Kenshin. But because of his strong beliefs, Kenshin will not teach the sword style he had learned. Therefore, Kenshin arranges for Yahiko to be trained in ''Kamiya Kasshin-ry\u016b'' by Kamiya Kaoru. As the series progresses, Yahiko becomes skilled at swordsmanship and faces many opponents.\n\n===Sagara Sanosuke===\n{{Main|Sagara Sanosuke}}\n{{nihongo|Sagara Sanosuke|\u76f8\u697d \u5de6\u4e4b\u52a9}} is a former member of the [[Sekih\u014dtai|Sekih\u014d Army]].

During his introduction in the series, he encounters the wanderer Himura Kenshin, who easily defeats him and is able to convince him to stop his mercenary work and instead start protecting people. Sanosuke becomes Kenshin's best friend as well as his partner in most of their fights.\n\n===Takani Megumi===\n{{Anime voices|[[Mika Doi]] (Japanese), [[Mari Devon]] (TV anime, English), Rebeca Robinson (''[[Samurai X: Reflection]]'', English)}}\n\n{{nihongo|Takani Megumi|\u9ad8\u8377 \u6075}} comes from a famous family of physicians from the [[Aizu]] region.{{gnr|ch|19}} She became the assistant to a Tokyo physician who had created a deadly new form of [[opium]], and when the doctor was killed she was forced to make the new opium for corrupt industrialist [[#Takeda Kanry\u016b|Takeda Kanry\u016b]] for the past three years.{{gnr|ch|19}} After being freed and stopped from committing suicide by Kenshin and Sanosuke, she becomes a doctor to atone for her past misdeeds.{{gnr|ch|29}} She has a wicked sense of humor and enjoys flirting with Kenshin to make Kaoru jealous (both Kaoru and Sanosuke refer to her as a \"[[Kitsune|vixen]]\" and in the manga vixen ears appear whenever she indulges in her sense of humor), but helps Kaoru come to terms with her feelings towards Kenshin. She is loyal to her friends and is always there to heal their wounds, especially Sanosuke, whom she often cautions about fighting.

Despite this version and her final version in the main series being so different, Watsuki said that they have the same spirit and therefore are not so unalike. Although he admitted the one-shot's version of Megumi had a \"lighter quality\" because of her small role, so he therefore gave her a more \"earthy quality\" in the main serial so she could make an impression. By the time of the publication of ''Rurouni Kenshin'' volume four, Watsuki felt some disappointment as she did not turn out nearly the way he wanted. However, because she is entertaining to draw and is the only other woman whom Kaoru can interact with, he planned to have Megumi appear frequently as a secondary character. Watsuki's used the young grandmother from [[Takeshi Obata]]'s ''Cyborg Jii-chan G'' as the design model for Megumi.

She traveled to Tokyo in search of Shinomori Aoshi whom she is in love with. She wishes to learn what happened to Aoshi and his comrades and follows Kenshin on his way to Kyoto hoping to meet him again.{{gnr|ch|64}} When she learns of how Aoshi has become evil and obsessed with revenge, she decides to take over his title as \"Okashira\" and tries to forget him but she can not. Kenshin promises that he will bring Aoshi back to her again.\n\n==Antagonists==\n\n===Hiruma Brothers===\nThe {{nihongo|Hiruma Brothers|\u6bd4\u7559\u9593 \u5144\u5f1f|Hiruma Ky\u014ddai}} are crooks who scheme to take ownership of Kaoru's dojo. After Kaoru's father died, the elder brother {{nihongo|Kihei|\u559c\u5175\u885b}} collapsed in front of the dojo and Kaoru took him in; becoming a kind of a live-in apprentice and gaining Kaoru's trust, while trying to persuade her to sell the dojo.{{gnr|ch|1}} {{nihongo|Gohei|\u4f0d\u5175\u885b}}, a former samurai who falsely uses the \"''Hitokiri Batt\u014dsai''\" and ''Kamiya Kasshin-ry\u016b'' names to commit murders. They use the {{nihongo|''Kiheikan''|\u9b3c\u5175\u9928}}, a former dojo in a neighboring town that has become a gathering spot for gamblers and rogues, as their base of operations.{{gnr|ch|1}} When Kaoru begins to discover the truth, the brothers attempt to kill her, but Kenshin easily defeats them after revealing himself to be the real ''Hitokiri Batt\u014dsai''.{{gnr|ch|1}} Having escaped jail, the brothers appear again hiring Sanosuke to fight Kenshin and planning to use a gun to kill a weakened Kenshin.{{gnr|ch|5}} When Kenshin defeats Sanosuke, Kenshin stops Kihei's bullet dead on the guard of his sword. When the brothers then try to attack Kaoru and Yahiko, Sanosuke defeats Gohei and Kenshin injures Kihei into submission.{{gnr|ch|7}} Later in the series, they are employed as bodyguards by [[#Fud\u014dsawa|Fud\u014dsawa]], a [[yakuza]] in Sanosuke's hometown, and then by [[#Tani J\u016bsanr\u014d|Tani J\u016bsanr\u014d]]. Sanosuke easily beats them up on both occasions.{{gnr|ch|228|, |234}}\n\nIn the anime, Gohei is the only brother to appear and is more intelligent than his manga counterpart. He is a former student at the Kamiya dojo, but when Gohei insisted using swords for killing and then unsuccessfully attacked the master of the dojo, Kaoru's father, he received a broken thumb and an expulsion. In the story Gohei tries to take over the Kamiya dojo, but Kenshin prevents him from doing so. Gohei hires Sanosuke to defeat Kenshin, but this fails. Later, he hires the Kisaki brothers to defeat Kenshin. Though they almost succeed, the brothers are defeated and Yahiko sends Gohei limping away after kicking him in the genitals. Gohei is voiced by Tetsuo Komura in Japanese, by [[Beau Billingslea]] in the Media Blasters dub and by [[Richard Epcar]] in the Sony ''Samurai X'' dub.\n\nWatsuki described the creation of the brothers as a \"direct function of the story.\" Watsuki wanted \"interesting villains to start things off with a bang\" and made one \"brainy\" and the other \"wild.\" He decided that the story involving the two coming together was taking \"too many\" pages, so he made the duo as brothers instead of being \"circumstantially related.\" He used a manager and director from Takeshi Obata's ''Chikarabito Densetsu'' sumo manga as a model for Kihei and a character he found in a magazine that made him think \"Ooh, ''impact''!\" for Gohei. Watsuki stated that, unlike the faces of Kenshin and other characters, the faces of Kihei and Gohei are of basic shapes and therefore the two were easy to draw as a result. He said that he became fonder of the brothers as his deadlines approached.<ref>Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (4) Hiruma Kihei & Gohei,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 1.

But when he was about to be disciplined for killing people he was not supposed to, he escaped and switched sides to the Ishin Shishi and became a ''hitokiri'' for hire in Kyoto.{{gnr|ch|10|, |11}} He now appears as a man dressed in a long kimono with a long scarf and straw hat, and has a unique technique to project [[qi|chi]] toward people, hypnotizing them with his eyes via the {{nihongo|''Shin no Ipp\u014d''|\u5fc3\u306e\u4e00\u65b9||\"One Side of the Soul\"}}.{{gnr|ch|10}} When Kenshin stops him from killing Tani J\u016bsanr\u014d, Jin-e makes Kenshin his next target.{{gnr|ch|10}} Believing the new repenting Kenshin to be soft and weak, Jin-e kidnaps Kaoru Kamiya in order to enrage Kenshin into his old ''Hitokiri Batt\u014dsai'' self.{{gnr|ch|12}} Though he assumes his old mindset and crushes Jin-e's right elbow, ending his life as a swordsman, Kenshin stops himself from killing when Kaoru calls out.{{gnr|ch|13}} Though spared, Jin-e stabs himself in the heart so the police will not discover who his government employer is.{{gnr|ch|14}}\n\nWatsuki intended for the motif of Jin-e to be [[Okada Iz\u014d]], the top ''hitokiri'' of the Bakumatsu, but admitted that his design looks even less like his counterpart than Kenshin's looks like his.<ref name=\"Udo\">Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (7) Ud\u014d Jin-e,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 2.

He summarized Jin-e as, in a sense, the only character to defeat Kenshin even though he did not defeat ''Batt\u014dsai''. Jin-e's outfit originates from that of [[Serizawa Kamo]], the main character from a Shinsengumi manga released around 14\u201315 years before the release of ''Rurouni Kenshin'' volume two in Japan.

Watsuki said that a lot of the changes he made to Jin-e in ''Restoration'' did not work out, proving that the original version is perfect. Giving Jin-e a motive to attack Kenshin, lost some of his madness; leaving out the ''Shin no Ipp\u014d'' for being \"too supernatural\", diminished the excitement unique to [[sh\u014dnen manga]]; and the change in his skin tone to make him odder, made keeping the tone of the entire story consistent difficult.<ref name=\"Restoration\">Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"Character/Production Anecdotes Part 56 -People of ''Rurouni Kenshin: Restoration''-\" ''Rurouni Kenshin: Restoration'' Volume 2.

Having acquired Kenshin's old katana in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Toba\u2013Fushimi]], Jin-e found employment under the corrupt, power-hungry business man, Takeda Kanry\u016b. While sent to assassinate Takani Megumi, Jin-e crosses paths with Kenshin and recognizes him. As Kenshin and Sanosuke deal with Kanry\u016b, Jin-e captures Kaoru and paralyzes her lungs to force Kenshin into a duel that ultimately leads to his own suicide.

He said that there was no real model in terms of design, and described Takeda Kanry\u016b as a \"carryover\" of Nishiwaki, a character in the first ''Rurouni: Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story'' one-shot. Kanry\u016b wears white since Watsuki felt that \"between Kenshin and Aoshi, there was too much black already.\" Watsuki felt that since he put so much emphasis on Megumi and the Oniwabansh\u016b, Kanry\u016b never became the character he intended, which \"was a bit of a letdown.\" The historical Takeda Kanry\u016bsai is well known as having been homosexual and Watsuki considered making Kanry\u016b homosexual as well, but dropped the idea as he felt it would \"unnecessarily complicate things.\"<ref>Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (12) Takeda Kanry\u016b,\" ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' Volume 4.

Sigh.\" Raij\u016bta's appearance was originally based on a character in an American superhero comic book,<!--DO NOT say which comic it is UNLESS you use a reliable source that states so.--> but as the story progressed his appearance and personality \"deteriorated.\" Because he had difficulty with \"the complicated details\" in the Oniwabansh\u016b story arc, Watsuki gave Raij\u016bta a relatively simple outfit with only one design flourish, the black feathers, which turned out to be difficult to draw. Watsuki concluded that the development of Raij\u016bta taught him a lot about character design.<ref>Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (16) Isurugi Raij\u016bta,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 6.

Because Arundo is jealous that Shibumi orders Sait\u014d Hajime to kill Kenshin, Sait\u014d allows Arundo to have the job, knowing he stands no chance.{{gnr|ch|50}} Arundo ambushes Kenshin and tries to use a chain to immobilize Kenshin, but is ultimately defeated.{{gnr|ch|51}} Arundo discovers that Sait\u014d is actually allied with [[#\u014ckubo Toshimichi|\u014ckubo Toshimichi]].

Watsuki believes that he was unable to make Arundo's chain-scythe to appear like real chains. The character's design originates from a superhuman soldier in an American comic book<!--DO NOT state who this is without a reliable source documenting it.--> who has a name similar to Arundo's,<ref>[[Nobuhiro Watsuki|Watsuki, Nobuhiro]]. \"The Secret Life of Characters (20) Akamatsu Arundo,\" ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' Volume 7.

Senkaku fights with a pair of [[Ulu|knuckle blades]] and has high speed, contrary to his size. However, this proves to be his undoing, as Kenshin defeats Senkaku in a battle by using the gigantic size as a way to stress out Senkaku's limits, causing his leg to break.{{gnr|ch|69}} The police take Senkaku away, in which Sait\u014d notes he would most likely be executed.{{gnr|ch|71}} In the anime, he manages to escape and is killed by [[Seta S\u014djir\u014d]].\n\nOriginally Senkaku was one of the Juppongatana and so Watsuki put a lot of effort into his creation. But since Shishio and S\u014djir\u014d were present and Kenshin needed to go to Kyoto, he decided to make Senkaku a \"violent village despot.\" Originally the author had Senkaku as an experimental character who could not form any words, but an editor commented that Senkaku \"is not a wild animal\" during a meeting, so Watsuki scrapped this idea. Senkaku had no model for his personality, and after the scrapping of the inarticulation trait he became \"pretty much just muscle-head small fry.\" The origin of Senkaku's design stems from the design of the four Abukuma priests, a group of minor antagonists. Watsuki had no attachment towards the four bald-headed priests, but felt that the cone-shaped head design was \"a waste for an unimportant character.\" So he instead used that design for Senkaku, who Watsuki said turned out to be unimportant also. In retrospect Watsuki felt that he may have been influenced by the Coneheads in a [[Sega Saturn]] commercial, and the Giant Soldier in ''[[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (manga)|Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind]]''. The author felt regret about Senkaku; what he regretted most was how he was unable to use Senkaku's special technique \"Piercing Head-Butt\" in the storyline.<ref>Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (25) Senkaku,\" ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' Volume 9.

Shishio was Kenshin's successor as ''hitokiri'' for the Ishin Shishi. Fearing he would threaten to reveal his victims publicly in order to gain leverage against them, the new Meiji government tried killing Shishio by dousing him in oil and burning him alive. But he survived and has recruited an army to get his revenge, with the government asking Kenshin to stop him.\n\n===Komagata Yumi===\n{{Anime voices|Kanako Irie|[[Wendee Lee]] (TV Series), Claire Hamilton (''New Kyoto Arc'')}}\n\n{{nihongo|Komagata Yumi|\u99d2\u5f62 \u7531\u7f8e}}, also known as {{nihongo|\"Caretaker\"|\u591c\u4f3d|Yotogi}},{{gnr|ch|97}} is Shishio's lover. She was the most famous ''[[oiran]]'' in [[Yoshiwara]] and took pride in it, until the [[Mar\u00eda Luz Incident]].{{gnr|ch|148}} She became reviled at the Japanese government's refusal to compensate the newly emancipated prostitutes due to it regarding them as equivalent to livestock.{{gnr|ch|148}} She serves as Kenshin, Sait\u014d and Sanosuke's guide through Shishio's maze-like hideout, taking them from each duel so as to avoid traps.{{gnr|ch|107}} She is often concerned about Shishio and his medical state.{{gnr|ch|136|, |141}} When Shishio's body becomes overheated in his fight with Kenshin, she runs in between them and pleads with Kenshin to end the duel, but Shishio runs her through with his sword, mortally wounding her in the process and injuring the unguarded Kenshin.{{gnr|ch|144}} Knowing that she has finally been of use to Shishio in his most important battle, she dies happy and released of her former frustration for not being able to fight next to him.{{gnr|ch|144}} She is then seen with Shishio and H\u014dji in hell.{{gnr|ch|148}}\n\nYumi was originally designed to be a sexy accessory for Shishio and nothing more, as Watsuki figured that a villain should always have a \"temptress\" or two around him, and so he was surprised to see her develop into a character so motivated by love. Commenting on her death, the author said he saw happiness for Yumi as following Shishio everywhere and figured \"everywhere\" would include hell. Watsuki had no particular personality model for Yumi, but the character is essentially a version of Ogin, a character played by actress [[Kaoru Yumi]] in ''Mitok\u014dmon Gaiden: Kager\u014d Ninp\u014d-Ch\u014d'', a spinoff series of ''[[Mitok\u014dmon]]''. Having designed Yumi on the spot with the intention of her to be sexy, Watsuki had no specific design model. But halfway through, Watsuki became a fan of [[Morrigan Aensland]] from ''[[Darkstalkers|Vampire Hunter]]'' and as a result began to expose more and more of Yumi's cleavage and shoulders, \"eventually increasing the sexiness by about 120%.\" Admitting that he has always had trouble drawing women, Watsuki stated that drawing Yumi taught him that he could have fun while drawing female characters not just by making them appear \"cute,\" but also by making them \"seductive, or even evil.\" He added that, since Yumi had a \"sexed-up body,\" botching even one line could make the character appear \"downright indecent.\" Watsuki stated that in this way, Yumi taught him the importance of skillful sketching.<ref name=\"YumiProfile\">[[Nobuhiro Watsuki|Watsuki, Nobuhiro]]. \"The Secret Life of Characters (40) Komagata Yumi,\" ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' Volume 17.

H\u014dji envisions Japan as a mighty power led by Shishio, ruling with the principles of basic animal survival. Although he is not proficient in any fighting style, he is a cunning organizer and possesses formidable leadership qualities. He manages to acquire firearms on the black market and purchases the gigantic [[ironclad warship]]\u2014{{nihongo|''Rengoku''|\u7149\u7344||\"Purgatory\"}} without anyone knowing.{{gnr|ch|76|, |99}} H\u014dji's plan with the Rengoku fails when Sanosuke blows it up with bombs. H\u014dji disagrees with Shishio using the Juppongatana to fight Himura Kenshin, believing they might lose, putting their actual goal to overthrow the government in jeopardy.{{gnr|ch|76}} But he strongly believes in Shishio's strength, even throwing away a gun he had hidden after Shishio and Kenshin's fight surpasses Shishio's fifteen-minute timelimit.{{gnr|ch|141}} He is in utter disbelief when Shishio finally loses upon bursting into flames and destroys Shishio's hideout in an attempt to kill Kenshin and company rather than accept his master's defeat.{{gnr|ch|146}} He is saved by [[#Y\u016bky\u016bzan Anji|Anji]] and then surrenders himself to the police, not for penance but to use the trial to project Shishio's ideals and plans.{{gnr|ch|146}} However, he is never given a trial and, although he was offered a government job should he pledge loyalty to it, H\u014dji commits suicide in his cell; using his blood to write a final message detailing his disgust with the regime: \"The world is dead to me. I go to serve my lord in Hell.\"{{gnr|ch|148}} In Hell, H\u014dji is reunited with Shishio and vows to continue following him in his new quest to conquer Hell.{{gnr|ch|148}}\n\nWatsuki stated that most of the overall concept for H\u014dji originates from a character in ''X-Men'', whose name sounds similar to H\u014dji's<!--Don't specify which one it is without a reliable source-->; the ''X-Men'' character gave him a \"hint\" for the story but not H\u014dji's personality. The ''X-Men'' character does not directly fight but instead invents machines to help his team members, so Watsuki wanted a character who held a support role in the Juppongatana. At first H\u014dji was just an individual who was surprised a lot, but Watsuki realized that would \"get awfully dull.\" When he decided to look at H\u014dji as Shishio's \"Number Two\" man (like [[Hijikata Toshiz\u014d]] and Shokatsury\u014d K\u014dmei) it \"strummed the chords of [his] heart,\" and ideas came one after another until H\u014dji became one of his favorite characters. Watsuki stated that H\u014dji's character design is \"100% original\" to him and that it is one of which he is the most confident in. Watsuki added that the one aspect he did not like about H\u014dji is his costume; he had wanted to make it more like the \"European style authentic\" to the time period, but could not find any resources.

However, he had difficulty in determining what Anji's backstory would be and whether he would be a friend or foe, so he put Anji in \"storage\" until his ultimate introduction. Having determined that Sanosuke needed to become more powerful, Watsuki introduced Anji as a counterpart to Sanosuke's fighting style, so that he could give Sanosuke a strong opponent and increase Sanosuke's power at the same time. Watsuki had no model for Anji's personality, but pictured him as being similar to Shinsengumi lieutenant Shimada Kai due to the \"manly air.\" He also said that Anji is his second attempt at \"manly intelligence,\" following the \"failed\" Isurugi Raij\u016bta. Anji's visual model originates from the lead vocalist of a punk band called Angie, and his name originates from the band's as well.

After hearing him talk of the new era, Seik\u016b entrusts Kenshin with his father's last sword.{{gnr|ch|80}} Despite assuming the sword to be a normal one, Kenshin is forced to use it to stop Ch\u014d; only to learn that it is another sakabat\u014d.{{gnr|ch|81}} After Shishio's death, Ch\u014d, who was given a full pardon in exchange for information, pays Kenshin and his friends a visit to inform them of what has happened to the members of the Juppongatana before going to work under Sait\u014d as a spy and informant.{{gnr|ch|147}} He later appears several times in the Jinch\u016b arc investigating or relaying information about Enishi.{{gnr|ch|183|, |200|, |213}} In the anime, Ch\u014d later appears when he tries to attack [[#Amakusa Sh\u014dgo|Amakusa]] but is soundly defeated.\n\nWatsuki had no particular model for Ch\u014d's personality, but said that if he had to give one, it would be the stereotyped depictions of people from the [[Kansai region]]. An assistant from Kansai checked Ch\u014d's accent, but Watsuki had it \"broken down\" so that everyone from Japan can understand it; meaning Ch\u014d's Kansai accent differs from the actual one. Watsuki created Ch\u014d's basic design when he was 20 years old; originally designed to be a space alien. While Watsuki did not use the alien aspect, he said the \"horse-headed monkey-face\" was \"hard to throw out completely,\" so he used it for Ch\u014d. The original design had black, \"messy\" hair swept back, but he gave Ch\u014d a \"[[punk rock]]\" quality to give the character more impact as the first Juppongatana member shown. Despite being a villain, Ch\u014d was a popular character with ''Rurouni Kenshin'' readers; Watsuki said that characters with Kansai dialects are \"''always'' pretty popular.\" Because he also enjoyed drawing Ch\u014d, the author felt it would be \"a waste\" to \"finish off\" Ch\u014d after the conclusion of the Iori story and therefore had him reappear at later points. But in \"a bit more of a neutral position\" since Watsuki felt it would be strange for Ch\u014d to \"become friendly with Kenshin and the others.\"<ref name=\"Ch\u014dpage\">[[Nobuhiro Watsuki|Watsuki, Nobuhiro]]. \"The Secret Life of Characters (29) Sawagej\u014d Ch\u014d,\" ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' Volume 10.

Equal to S\u014djir\u014d in strength, he is the member most feared by Shishio.{{gnr|ch|93}} Before the revolution, he was a swordsman working for the [[Shogun]] as an anti-''hitokiri''. In a fight against Shishio, he was blinded in both eyes and has trained to take revenge ever since.{{gnr|ch|93}} Usui and Shishio made a deal upon him joining the Juppongatana; Usui can try to kill Shishio anytime he gets the chance.{{gnr|ch|93}} A native of the [[Ryukyu Islands]], Usui fights using a short spear with a weighted end - the ''[[Tinbe-Rochin|rochin]]'' - to attack, and a [[tortoise]] shell - the ''[[Tinbe-Rochin|tinbei]]'' - as a shield to deflect attacks and block the enemy's vision.{{gnr|ch|114}} He possesses the {{nihongo|''Shingan''|\u5fc3\u773c||[[mind's eye]]}}, which is actually [[superhuman]] hearing that lets him hear another's heartbeat, muscle contractions and bone friction thus enabling him to read their emotions and physical position.{{gnr|ch|113}} Usui dies when his body is ripped in half by Sait\u014d's attack.{{gnr|ch|114}}\n\nUsui originated from a chat Watsuki had with one of his assistants who proposed a blind swordsman. Although originally not interested in the idea, Watsuki decided to go with it after discussing the Shingan ability that read people's emotions by listening to their heartbeat and pulse. The original plan was to have Usui fight Kenshin right after he fought Ch\u014d - chasing him down in the city in a manner similar to the [[Terminator (character concept)|Terminator]]; but the plot went in a different direction, with Usui fighting and dying at the hands of Sait\u014d. Watsuki did state that the Terminator-like character he did not use would be showing up after the Kyoto arc. The author said that he regretted creating Usui, like he regretted creating Raij\u016bta, but that Usui became more popular and therefore \"that must also mean\" Usui is stronger. The model for Usui's design is [[Taopaipai]] from ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' by [[Akira Toriyama]]; Watsuki said that as the first villain to defeat [[Goku|Son Goku]], Taopaipai made \"a strong impression.\" As for the \"eyeball-covered costume,\" Watsuki originally planned to give Usui a plain \"tribal\" outfit, but scratched that idea after seeing the \"[[List of Angels in Neon Genesis Evangelion#Matarael|spider-like angel]]\" in ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]''. He originally planned to make Usui a \"handsome, long-haired type,\" but when he saw a rough sketch of the concept, it looked too much like Uky\u014d from ''[[Samurai Shodown|Samurai Spirits]]''<!--SamuSupi -> Samurai Spirits -> Samurai Shodown-->, so he started over.

He then tries to commit suicide with a needle, but Misao knocks him unconscious, preventing him from driving it into his neck.{{gnr|ch|124}} Pardoned for his crimes, the government hopes to use Kamatari as a foreign spy under the guise of an exchange student, but his sadness over Shishio's death has him contemplating suicide.{{gnr|ch|147}} So Ch\u014d lies to Kamatari claiming that Shishio wanted the Juppongatana to live and spread his story to prevent the government from rewriting it in the event of their loss.{{gnr|ch|147}}\n\nThe concept for Kamatari originated from a play on words by Watsuki's assistant [[Eiichiro Oda]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mania.com/anime-expo-friday-report_article_86123.html |title=Anime Expo 2002: Friday Report |first=Andrew |last=Tei |date=2005-07-05 |publisher=Mania Entertainment |accessdate=2018-03-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727032541/http://www.mania.com/anime-expo-friday-report_article_86123.html |archivedate=2008-07-27}}</ref> in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], {{nihongo|''okama''|\u304a\u91dc}} is a slang word for homosexual, while the word for a scythe is {{nihongo|''kama''|\u938c}}. Watsuki used ideas from assistants to create many of the Juppongatana and Kamatari was one he seized immediately, but when coming up with the specifics, the concept \"just wasn't coming together.\" In the beginning some of his ideas were \"male-appearing on the surface, but personality-wise, will be feminine,\" \"A very erotic and seductive, womanly appearance from the outside, but a manly man on the inside,\" and \"a big macho gay guy.\" But a friend of Watsuki's suggested to make Kamatari \"just a 'pretty girl' type,\" leading to the solidification of the character. Watsuki planned for Kamatari to have a \"light-hearted and cheerful\" personality, but found complications when a \"more serious side\" began to emerge, leading him to feel some regret with the outcome; he admitted that one of his bad habits is to cross the fine line between \"serious\" and \"depressing\". Watsuki added that the next time he will use the character, he will try to \"keep his outlook sunny\" while not compromising the \"essential self.\" Watsuki used [[Ikari Yui]] from ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'' as the visual model for Kamatari's face; but colored the hair black<!--Even though the anime doesn't use black, keep in mind the manga is only white and black-->, exposed more of the forehead, and had the back of Kamatari's hair \"flip out as I've seen so many high-schoolers do these days.\" Watsuki found that the character's triangular silhouette has influences from [[Hsien-Ko|Rei-Rei]] in ''Vampire Hunter''. The large chain-scythe that Kamatari uses exists in real life, but Watsuki made the blade larger to give it \"a real super-impact look\" and noted that it is not intended to be used in the way that Kamatari does.<ref name=\"Kamataripage\">[[Nobuhiro Watsuki|Watsuki, Nobuhiro]]. \"The Secret Life of Characters (37) Honj\u014d Kamatari,\" ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' Volume 15.

His battle technique is called {{nihongo|Fire Flight|\u98db\u7a7a\u767a\u7834|Hiku Happa}}, in which he uses [[dynamite]] to lift himself into flight and attack from above with a blade on his arm before blowing himself back into the air.{{gnr|ch|122}} The power of flight is harnessed thanks to Henya starving himself to extreme [[emaciation]]; he is so light that the constant uplift from the explosions can easily keep him in the air with the wings.{{gnr|ch|12}} Yahiko defeats Henya by gliding on a [[sh\u014dji]] door blown up by Henya's dynamite and attacking him from above.{{gnr|ch|122}} Henya is pardoned for his crimes and used as an army spy in Asia by the government because of his aviation abilities.{{gnr|ch|147}}\n\nHenya was modeled after Matsubayashi Henyasai, a swordsman in the early [[Edo period]] who possessed \"avoidance techniques,\" which would now be called [[acrobatics]] in the modern era. Watsuki revealed that he originally planned to introduce Henya as a [[tengu]] during the Megumi arc as part of the Oniwabansh\u016b, but that story was \"not as well-planned as it otherwise might have been,\" so the chance was lost and Henya had to become one of the Juppongatana. It was originally planned for Henya to engage in a mid-air battle with Kenshin, but Watsuki felt that Kenshin had become too strong after learning the secret ''Hiten Mitsurugi-ry\u016b'' technique, so Yahiko became his opponent instead. Henya's design model was a bat with a streamlined head and \"a little bit\" of [[List of Cyborg 009 characters##00 Cyborgs|Cyborg 002]] from ''[[Cyborg 009]]''. The author intended for Henya to be \"monster-like\" since, originally none of the Juppongatana aside from S\u014djir\u014d were supposed to be \"lookers.\" Watsuki reported that some people felt that Henya was \"''still'' too good-looking,\" so he made his body \"super-emaciated.\" He said that [[Freak (Image Comics)|Freak]] from ''[[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]]'' was also a reference for Henya.<ref name=\"Henyaprofile\">[[Nobuhiro Watsuki|Watsuki, Nobuhiro]]. \"The Secret Life of Characters (36) Hariwa Henya,\" ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' Volume 15.

Despite defeating four members of the Kyoto Oniwabansh\u016b by himself, Iwanb\u014d flees when Henya and Kamatari are defeated.{{gnr|ch|124}} After Shishio's defeat, Ch\u014d remarks that Iwanb\u014d is too stupid to do anything on his own.{{gnr|ch|148}} Iwanb\u014d is later shown to be a [[karakuri puppet]] controlled from the inside by [[#Gein|Gein]].{{gnr|ch|152}} Gein uses the new Iwanb\u014d Version Three, Savage Mode to fight Kenshin during the [[#Six Comrades|Six Comrades]]' attack on Kamiya dojo.{{gnr|ch|187}} This version has detachable unrestricted joints, allowing every limb to move in any direction, and anti-piercing armor of woven steel protecting Gein inside.{{gnr|ch|188|, |190}} It is defeated when Kenshin lodges debris in its internal gears to stop its offense, and then destroyed by his strongest technique.{{gnr|ch|191}}\n\nFollowing having a \"giant\" in the Juppongatana (Fuji), Iwanb\u014d was created as a \"full body costume.\" Although Watsuki admitted he might have included too many elements from the Kyoto arc in the Jinch\u016b arc, he said he enjoyed the character of Iwanb\u014d. Because he had to hide the fact that it was just a costume, the author portrayed Version One as a very mysterious character, but the design kept changing and he became a \"weird, but likable personality.\" Version Two was not intended to appear, but because Gein broke Version One, Watsuki had to \"cut and paste\" and utilized this in the story later. Version Three had to fight Kenshin and therefore was made into a \"powerful suit.\" The author reflected that after all this, he seems to have gotten carried away, making Iwanb\u014d feel out of place in the ''Rurouni Kenshin'' universe. The design models for Version One (and Two) were the characters [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] and [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]] from ''X-Men''. But elements of [[Victor von Gerdenheim|Victor]] and [[Sasquatch (Darkstalkers)|Sasquatch]] from ''Vampire Hunter'' were also incorporated, making him \"cuter.\" The design model for Version Three was the comic book character [[Hulk]], specifically the version that was on ''Marvel X'', a small booklet included in an issue of ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' in relation to ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]''. Version Three's full body tattoo was added to give him the look of a \"battling tribe\" from an undeveloped world, but Watsuki said it does not look that good.<ref>[[Nobuhiro Watsuki|Watsuki, Nobuhiro]]. \"The Secret Life of Characters (43) Iwanb\u014d (Versions One-Three,\" ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' Volume 22.

Saizuchi's talents lie not in battle-abilities, but his proficient use of words. Having taken Fuji in after he was nearly killed, Saizuchi reminds Fuji that he has to repay him.{{gnr|ch|126}} During the Juppongatana's attack of Aoi-Ya, Saizuchi attempts to destroy the morale of the Oniwabansh\u016b by giving a speech as to why it is impossible for them to defeat Fuji and himself.{{gnr|ch|125}} Saizuchi is knocked unconscious when Fuji's left arm falls on him upon being defeated by [[#Hiko Seij\u016br\u014d|Hiko Seij\u016br\u014d]].{{gnr|ch|127}} Pardoned for his crimes, Saizuchi uses his gifts of persuasion for the Foreign Ministry in secret negotiations.{{gnr|ch|147}}\n\nThe overall model for Saizuchi is a villainous elf who tricks the giant in what Watsuki was told is a Finnish folktale called \"Frost Giant\"; he combined that with an \"image of a giant-robot pilot.\" Originally Watsuki planned for Okina to fight Saizuchi, but he cut the concept because he wanted to maintain the balance of the story and because his \"inner story-editor\" asked him if anyone would really like to see \"two old codgers\" fight each other. The design model is Director-General Luchi of the Akuda Republic from ''Purin Purin Monogatari'', an [[NHK]] [[puppet show]]. Watsuki said that the large size of Director-General Luchi's head would \"freak me out.\" Watsuki commented that Luchi's design was \"efficient\" since one could tell that he was very intelligent at one glance. Watsuki felt that of all the Juppongatana, Saizuchi got the \"short end of the stick\" since the character did not have a chance to fully display what his \"massive brain could do.\" He described this as the \"Senkaku Effect,\" where the characters with the \"best noggins\" are not used to their \"full potential.\"<ref name=\"Saizuchimodel\">[[Nobuhiro Watsuki|Watsuki, Nobuhiro]]. \"The Secret Life of Characters (39) Elder Saizuchi,\" ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' Volume 15.

Considered a freak by everyone around him, one day he was attacked and almost killed but Saizuchi found him and took him in.{{gnr|ch|126}} The gentle, depressed Fuji was in an ideal state for Saizuchi to manipulate his emotions and turn him into an unbelievable fighter. Saizuchi keeps telling Fuji that he owes him for saving his life and uses that to control him.{{gnr|ch|126}} Fuji is easily defeated by Hiko Seij\u016br\u014d, who acknowledges Fuji's samurai soul and was the first to look at Fuji as someone other than a monster.{{gnr|ch|126|, |127}} Pardon for his crimes, the Meiji government assigns Fuji to Hokkaid\u014d to develop land and act as a defending fighter during times of war.{{gnr|ch|147}}\n\nThe idea for a giant originated from the [[List of Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind characters#God Warriors|God-Soldier]] in the ''[[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (film)|Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind]]'', after Watsuki saw the film. He wondered if it would \"even be interesting\" for Kenshin to fight a giant, but could not let it go and so decided to have Fuji fight Hiko instead. Watsuki revealed that he and his editor both had doubts about actually doing it because Fuji was so big, but friends and assistants told him it would be fun and he was pleased that it seemed to have paid off. Fuji also utilized inspiration from what Watsuki was told is a Finnish folktale called \"Frost Giant\", in which a monster-like giant is revealed to have a heart. The design was inspired by the first [[Evangelion (mecha)|Eva]] in ''Neon Genesis Evangelion''. The face originated from Eva #2, but Watsuki's assistants believed the design looked too similar. So his then-assistant [[Hiroyuki Takei]] created a \"skull-like riff on Eva #1\" and Watsuki added the biting of his helmet's anchor rope feature, finishing Fuji's helmet face. Watsuki tried \"very hard\" to keep the body from being too similar to the Eva. Fuji's actual face originates from Dogura Magura in ''Arabian Lamp-Lamp'' by Takeshi Obata; Watsuki wanted to work with the concept of a \"monstrous character who's still somehow good looking,\" which Watsuki says Dogura Magura is \"the epitome of.\" The author admitted that due to the \"tight\" schedule of the Fuji chapters, he had insufficient time to revise the design, resulting in \"an essentially unoriginal face.\"<ref name=\"Fujipage\">[[Nobuhiro Watsuki|Watsuki, Nobuhiro]]. \"The Secret Life of Characters (38) Fuji (Real Name Unknown),\" ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' Volume 15.

The diamond edged steel wires he uses, {{nihongo|''Zankosen''|\u65ac\u92fc\u7dda}}, to control his puppets can also be used as a weapon as they are sharp enough to cut flesh and break bone.{{gnr|ch|216}} Gein just wants to test out his creations and needs to be around men of battle to do it since, according to him, the forefront of technology is always in battle.{{gnr|ch|188}} This is also the reason why Gein joined Shishio.{{gnr|ch|188}} During the attack on Kamiya dojo, Gein fights Kenshin by operating a new version of Iwanb\u014d.{{gnr|ch|188}} For Enishi's Jinch\u016b he creates a corpse doll of Kaoru to fool Kenshin into thinking she had been killed by Enishi, he considers this his masterpiece.{{gnr|ch|211}} Having completed his job, Enishi and Woo Heishin both decide to have Gein killed during his return boat ride to Tokyo, but Gein easy kills the large group of martial artists who attack him.{{gnr|ch|214}} When retrieving his Kaoru doll from the graveyard, he runs into a trap set by Aoshi, who knew that the corpse was a fake.{{gnr|ch|215}} Aoshi kills Gein after having him divulge where the real Kaoru is.{{gnr|ch|217}}\n\nGein originated from serial killer [[Ed Gein]]<!--Note: Viz Media's English release incorrectly gives Gein's given name as \"Edgar\".-->, who made lampshades and chairs out of corpses, combined with the puppet master required by the story. Watsuki suggested Gein might have been one of the most popular of the Six Comrades based on the many negative comments he got when he unveiled his face, like he did with [[#Han'nya|Han'nya]]. He wanted to \"challenge a good-looking masked character like [[Char Aznable|Char]] from ''[[Gundam]]''.\" Gein's obsession with functional and physical beauty comes from the author's own. Gein had no model in terms of physical design; his costume mixes the outfits worn by stage crew and a skull mark from his \"necromancer\" image. This minimal \"highlights\" outfit was a successful experiment for Watsuki's next work where he hoped to have fewer highlights to save time.<ref>Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (47) Gein,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 24.

While shown to be a relatively selfless person when first introduced, his nature is later distorted until he reaches the point of insanity. During the Battle of Toba\u2013Fushimi in the Bakumatsu, Kujiranami's right arm was cut off by Kenshin.{{gnr|ch|154}} Kujiranami requested that Kenshin kill him since he did not want to live to see an era where wars are fought with guns instead of swords, absent of skill and soul. However, Kenshin refused, saying that he did not want to kill any more than he needed to and that Kujiranami should live in the new era. Already feeling that he had been robbed of a warrior's pride and era, being robbed of a warrior's death was the last straw for Kujiranami.{{gnr|ch|154}} Since then he vowed to kill Kenshin for dishonoring him and joined the Six Comrades to get his revenge. Enishi gave Kujiranami an [[Armstrong cannon]] to replace his missing arm which Kujiranami uses to blow up the Akabeko and [[#Chief Uramura|Chief Uramura]]'s home.{{gnr|ch|154|, |155|, |161}} During the attack on Kamiya dojo, he is taken down by Sait\u014d and arrested,{{gnr|ch|207}} but later goes berserk in his jail cell and breaks out.{{gnr|ch|218}} He gets the upgraded weapon he received from Enishi, a grenade launcher, and goes on a rampage in Tokyo searching for Kenshin. Yahiko is the only one around to fight Kujiranami at the time and manages to hold him off until Kenshin arrives and cuts off his grenade launcher, which returns his sanity.{{gnr|ch|226}} Afterwards Yahiko manages to convince Kujiranami that his hatred for a fellow samurai is wrong and has done nothing for him except lead him down the wrong path. Moved to tears by Yahiko's words, Kujiranami accepts that he was wrong, apologizes to Kenshin and turns himself back into the police.{{gnr|ch|226}}\n\nThe idea for a one-handed fighter originates from Iba Hachir\u014d, a swordsman from the Bakumatsu. Watsuki originally planned to make Enishi one-handed, but after considering the problems involving a one-handed swordsman facing the skilled Kenshin and deciding that \"boss fights\" should simply involve a sword versus a sword, he made Kujiranami one-handed instead. Kujiranami was going to be the Terminator-like character that Watsuki initially planned for Usui, but the idea was scrapped again due to him and his assistants being exhausted at the time. The design model for Kujiranami is [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] from ''X-Men'', one of Watsuki's favorite villains. He felt that Apocalypse's lips are \"quite interesting,\" so he gave Kujiranami similar lips. Another theme used is \"macho middle age fatness,\" which the author enjoyed depicting.<ref>Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (49) Kujiranami Hy\u014dgo,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 25.

He is the student of [[#Yaminobu|Tatsumi]] who was killed by Kenshin fifteen years ago. Inui does not seek to avenge his master's death, whom he calls a loser, but is using it as an excuse to fight and prove how powerful he is.{{gnr|ch|159}} He likes to boast about being invincible and undefeated, but Sano figures out that Banjin is full of himself from wearing the gauntlets and that he only fights people weaker than him. Inui attacks [[#Minor characters|Maekawa dojo]] as part of the Jinch\u016b campaign while [[#Otowa Hy\u014dko|Otowa Hy\u014dko]] simultanesouly attacks Chief Uramura's house.{{gnr|ch|158}} During the encounter, Sanosuke wrecks one of his gauntlets with the Mastery of Two Layers.{{gnr|ch|160}} After receiving a pair of upgraded gauntlets from Enishi, the \"Neo-Invulnerable Gauntlets\", he fights Sano again during the attack on Kamiya dojo.{{gnr|ch|186}} In the end Inui provokes Sano into attacking him with the Mastery of Two Layers again and is defeated as a result with both of his gauntlets destroyed.{{gnr|ch|193}} After being taken down, Inui vows to kill Sano next time and Sano welcomes him to try but warns him that he will not win as long as he wears the gauntlets to cover his weakness. Banjin is arrested by the police afterwards.\n\nOriginally considered for the Juppongatana, Inui started as a \"camouflage costume character.\" Then he was going to have army style hand-to-hand combat, but when it was questioned whether or not such a thing existed in this time period, he changed to being a combined martial-arts user, with gauntlets added for uniqueness. His personality is that of a \"very lively idiot\" and is taken from Kazama Kangetsu in ''Samurai Spirits''. Kangetsu was also the design model for the character, specifically the version of Kangetsu that appears at the end of the game. Watsuki said that because a lot of different concepts went into Inui, he looks weird, which the author greatly regrets. He also regrets him looking too much like Kangetsu, and vowed that this would be the last time he uses ''Samurai Spirits'' as a design. However, Watsuki said he likes Inui quite a bit, and would like to create more of these \"stupid types\" in his next work.<ref>Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (44) Inui Banjin,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 22. [[Viz Media]]. 138.</ref> In the first live-action film, Inui appears as one of Kanry\u016b's men and is portrayed by [[Genki Sudo]].\n\n====Otowa Hy\u014dko====\n{{nihongo|Otowa Hy\u014dko|\u4e59\u548c \u74e2\u6e56}}, the {{nihongo|\"Human Shadow Instrument\"|\u4eba\u9593\u6697\u5668}}, is member number five of the Six Comrades and an effeminate-looking user of assassin's weapons or \"Instruments of the Shadows\".{{gnr|ch|155|, |195}} He says he has thirteen hidden weapons all over his body, but only four are shown in the series. The first is {{nihongo|Baika Ch\u016bzen|\u6885\u82b1\u8896\u7bad}}, a small six-barreled arrow-launcher worn on his left wrist.{{gnr|ch|160}} The second is the {{nihongo|Kasui Busuen|\u904e\u6c34\u6bd2\u7159}}, a paralyzing mist generated by dropping two small cubes into water.{{gnr|ch|160}} The third is a jar of iron powder, {{nihongo|Bishamon's Powder|\u6bd8\u6c99\u9580\u7c89}}, used in conjunction with his magnetic {{nihongo|Bishamon's Sword|\u6bd8\u6c99\u9580\u5263}}.{{gnr|ch|194}} The last is the {{nihongo|Rikud\u014dko|\u516d\u9053\u8831}}, six long piercing tentacle-like appendages worn on his torso.{{gnr|ch|194}} His battle tactic is to outwit the opponent and catch them off guard with his hidden weapons as opposed to simply overpowering them. Otowa is a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] individual who enjoys killing people for fun and is not above targeting women and children. Otowa seeks Kenshin's death in revenge for the death of his friend [[#Yaminobu|Nakaj\u014d]], whom he had competitive killing sprees with.{{gnr|ch|160|, |172}} In reality Otowa joined the fight just for pleasure.{{gnr|ch|195}} Otowa attacks Chief Uramura's house as part of the Jinch\u016b campaign while Inui simultanesouly attacks Maekawa dojo.{{gnr|ch|158}} Otowa later fights My\u014djin Yahiko during the attack on Kamiya dojo.{{gnr|ch|187}} He comes close to killing Yahiko with a few of his weapons, but Yahiko eventually defeats him.{{gnr|ch|196}} As Otowa goes down he has a crazed smile on his face as he could not believe his defeat at the hands of someone not even half his age; though Sanosuke notes Otowa was not in peak form because he was fearful of Kenshin's abilities and thinking of fleeing after the duel with Yahiko.{{gnr|ch|196}} Otowa is arrested by the police afterwards.\n\nWatsuki had no personality model for Otowa and made him cruel because he is a shadow instrument user, which he notes resulted in him being sort of like Kanry\u016b. The author wanted to make him more cunning and sadistic, but said Otowa was not developed satisfactorily due to his own incompetence. Otowa's design model was a previously rejected \"[[drag queen]]-ish\" villain who wore a lot of lipstick. The six-pronged accessory was borrowed from [[Mister Sinister|Mr. Sinister]] in ''X-Men: Age of Apocalypse''. Watsuki said that he feels Otowa is one of his better designed characters.<ref name=\"Otowa\">Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (45) Otowa Hy\u014dko,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 22.

His teeth have also been sharpened into fangs from a young age, although his long tongue is natural.{{gnr|ch|197}} Fifteen years earlier, Yatsume took up fighting and joined the [[#Yaminobu|Yaminobu]] in order to support his clan, who had fallen on hard times due to depleted gold mines, by hoping to prove to the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] that their bodies had battle potential.{{gnr|ch|197}} But the Yaminobu were defeated by Kenshin and the Shogunate defeated by the Ishin Shishi. Yatsume wants revenge on Kenshin to uphold the laws of his clan (which state that anyone who sees a member of their clan must be killed) and for the misfortunes of his clan, which he blames on the Ishin Shishi and Kenshin.{{gnr|ch|196|, |197}} Before he can fight Kenshin however, he ends up fighting Sait\u014d instead and is brutally maimed in defeat, despite having managed to outmaneuver the man's trademark attack once.{{gnr|ch|198|, |199}} Kenshin stops Sait\u014d from killing him and offers to let Yatsume fight him if he still wants to after healing, but suggests that he go up north and use his abilities to help his clan.{{gnr|ch|199}} He is arrested by the police afterwards.\n\nYatsume's model was ''kumo otoko'' (\"Spider Man\"), not the American version, so he has similar roots as Han'nya. Because the \"freaks\" theme did not go so well with Han'nya, Yatsume is Watsuki's second attempt at it. But the author said he was utterly defeated, citing Sait\u014d as the biggest reason; any character turns into a weakling in front of Sait\u014d, just like Usui did. Watsuki said that the body shaping is one of the ideas he likes, but seems a little unfitting for a shonen manga. Because body deformation is a very sensitive issue, he had to be careful how he dealt with it, which might have detracted from the storyline as a whole. He stated that there would be no further attempts at the freaks theme because he has come to the belief that there needs to be more \"positive themes\" in shonen manga; but will still use it in terms of design. Watsuki admitted that the design model is all \"jumbled up.\" The silhouette version of Yatsume, seen before his full reveal, was modeled after the \"bandana mask version\" of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] from ''X-Men'' and [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] from ''[[Spider-Man]]''. After being told by various people to \"do Spider-Man, or to do Spawn and such,\" Watsuki got agitated and said \"I'll throw in [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] also!,\" which he referred to as digging his own grave. The gold-mining clan backstory was added after the fact, but Yatsume still ended up sticking out from the time period.<ref>Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (46) Yatsume Mumy\u014di,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 23.

He possesses no true fighting skills and is guarded by the [[#S\u016b-shin|S\u016b-shin]], who are skilled in various fighting styles.{{gnr|ch|238}} In exchange for being allowed to use the organization's resources for his personal Jinch\u016b campaign, Enishi agreed to hand over total control of it to Heishin.{{gnr|ch|214}} After receiving control, Heishin tries to have the S\u016b-shin take Enishi's revenge by killing Kenshin.{{gnr|ch|237}} But all four are defeated by Kenshin's comrades, while Heishin is beaten up by Enishi. He later recovers and begins shooting with dual revolvers before being beaten up by Enishi again, but when Enishi is about to kill Heishin, Kenshin stops him.{{gnr|ch|250}}\n\nWatsuki had no model for Heishin. He created him after his editor told Watsuki that he needed to put more depth into the black market weapons organization. Since the organization was made simply to explain Enishi's finances, Watsuki believed that the addition of Heishin \"didn't seem to change anything.\" The author felt that chapters flew by and he was unable to set Heishin's personality, so he became \"this pathetic creature.\" Even though Heishin was his favorite \"#2,\" he became an unattractive character and Watsuki regretted how he turned out. Heishin also had no design model; he was designed around the time of the Tomoe chapters when Watsuki was aiming for originality and creating characters that did not obviously look like any other. Heishin was designed to be \"heavy\" on black to contrast with the \"whiteness\" of Enishi.<ref>Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (52) Woo Heishin,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 27.

They are identical quadruplets named after the [[Four Symbols (China)|four symbols of Chinese astrology]], and each versed in a different form of combat. Heishin tries to have the S\u016b-shin take Enishi's revenge by killing Kenshin, but Kenshin's friends take them on so he can save his energy for Enishi.{{gnr|ch|237|, |238}} {{nihongo|Seiry\u016b|\u9752\u9f8d}} fights using a [[naginata]]-like weapon and prides himself on being able to determine his opponents moves and conquer them. He lets himself be hit by Sait\u014d's ''Gatotsu'' and correctly identifies its weakness as the blind spot created by extending the right hand as a counterweight. But Sait\u014d defeats him with the move regardless by using his right hand to grab Seiry\u016b by the mouth.{{gnr|ch|339}} {{nihongo|Suzaku|\u6731\u96c0}} fights using two swords and prides himself on being able to mimic his opponents moves.

Although he delivers a lot of blows, Sanosuke defeats Byakko as his attacks are too weak to do any damage.{{gnr|ch|341}} {{nihongo|Genbu|\u7384\u6b66}} fights with what looks like a staff but is actually a retractable six-jointed mace and prides himself on his battle strategy. He is defeated when Yahiko uses the ''Kamiya Kasshin-ry\u016b'' secret technique and ultimately destroys his mace.{{gnr|ch|342}}\n\nThe S\u016b-shin had no personality models and were created simply to \"fill out the numbers.\" As the story advanced towards Kenshin's final battle, Watsuki realized that the other characters would have no \"glamour\" and created the S\u016b-shin on the spot. Because they were \"irresponsibly made,\" he initially named them the \"Four Stars\", but changed it to the \"Four Gods\" and individually named them after the four godly beasts. He realized this and tried to fix the dialogue but it \"got weird\" and the fights were not as glamorous as he had hoped. This made him realize how important it is to decide the scenes and plot in advance. The S\u016b-shin had no design models either; it was simply an easy to draw design and making them quadruplets in Chinese clothes without any tone.

When Hiko was placed in ''Rurouni Kenshin'', the author simplified the design, such as changing the hair to make it easier to draw. Watsuki said that Hiko's body became \"more macho\" because he is a different kind of ''Hiten Mitsurugi-ry\u016b'' swordsman and because of the addition of \"manliness.\" At the time, Watsuki said that he was fascinated by images of \"manliness\" and that Hiko is one of the first characters to reflect this fascination. His cloak originates from the American comic book series ''Spawn''.

This reticence left Kiyosato unaware of her thoughts, and\u2014thinking that he needed to please her with greater accomplishments\u2014made him join the [[Kyoto Mimawarigumi]].{{gnr|ch|174}} He was killed by Kenshin in 1864 in Kyoto, but not before injuring him with the first half of his cross-shaped scar.{{gnr|ch|165}} Around six months later, Kenshin sticks up for Tomoe against two Aizu samurai in a pub. Later when she tries to thank him, she witnesses him kill an assassin sent to kill him.{{gnr|ch|167}} She faints, though Kenshin knows he should kill her for being a witness, he can not bring himself to do so and takes her to his room at an inn housing his fellow [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain|Ch\u014dsh\u016b]] Ishin Shishi. He asks her to promise to forget what she saw and leave, but instead she starts to work at the inn and the two develop feelings for one another.{{gnr|ch|168|, |169}} Following the [[Ikedaya incident|Ikeda-Ya]] and [[Kinmon incident]]s the Ch\u014dsh\u016b are near ruin, so Katsura Kogor\u014d tells Kenshin to lay-low in a farm village and bring Tomoe to better blend in. But Kenshin reveals to Tomoe that he does not want it only for appearance sake, and the two get married.{{gnr|ch|170}} When Enishi arrives to tell his sister that the Yaminobu operation to kill Kenshin is nigh, she sends him away, and subsequently reveals her past to Kenshin (but not about the current conspiracy).{{gnr|ch|173|, |174}} The following morning, Tomoe leaves Kenshin to meet with the Yaminobu in the hopes of misleading them and saving his life, only to find that she was nothing but a pawn in their plans, and ended up being used as bait to draw him in for the kill.{{gnr|ch|175}} In the middle of Kenshin's duel with the leader of the Yaminobu, Tomoe throws herself between them. With his senses impaired, Kenshin is unable to see her until it is too late, and delivers a fatal blow to his opponent and to her with the same slash of his sword.{{gnr|ch|178}} The little sword she was holding falls from her hand and gives Kenshin the second part of his cross-shaped scar.{{gnr|ch|178}} A gravestone for Tomoe was erected in a Kyoto temple, where Kenshin also left her diaries.{{gnr|ch|181}}\n\nEven though the plot for the \"remembrance episodes\" was already set before serialization started, which was three and a half years before her debut, Watsuki had no model for Tomoe other than a \"super beautiful woman whose intent was unclear\" or put simply \"cool beauty.\" He said she became an [[Rei Ayanami|Ayanami]] lookalike, with the only unique feature being her black pupils. The author said he did not realize that because cool beauties do not show emotion, once she revealed her true feelings in the end, she become a completely different character. He also pointed out that her death is the same as Yumi's. Watsuki said he not only regretted what he made her into, but was also \"disgusted with himself.\" He said he did enjoy the first half when she was a cool beauty and would like to bring her back in a different work.<ref>Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (41) Yukishiro (Himura) Tomoe,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 21.

As the story progressed Watsuki found himself adding additional details such as her family name, her status as the daughter of the owner of ''Akabeko'', and her collecting of [[nishiki-e]] paintings. He said that Tae was his first character to evolve in this manner and he would like it to continue to surprise himself. The author said he used \"no thought\" while creating Tae, including a lack of planning in her character design, which originates from a rejected model for Kenshin with a prototype Kenshin hairstyle colored black<!--The anime pic may show dark brown, but the manga is only in black and white, so...--> and a \"softer, female\" face. Tae has no lipstick so she would be easily distinguished from Megumi. Watsuki originally intended for Tae to have a [[Kansai dialect]] and had an assistant from the [[Kansai region]] vet the dialog, but Watsuki ultimately rejected the idea after he felt the concept was becoming too strange.<ref name=\"TaeProfile\">Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (18) Sekihara Tae,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 6.

The storyline was created to act as a bridge to the Raij\u016bta one and to give Yahiko the spotlight. The concept of \"a young girl being a young man's motivation to act\" introduced her as the heroine. The author used Tsubame as a \"testament\" of the \"wrong thinking of a previous age\" and gave her a manner that contrasts with Yahiko's \"acts-before-he-thinks\" manner. Her design model originated from a popular \"planet-themed\" anime series, particularly its character symbolized by the \"ringed-planet.\" As Tsubame is \"an average girl\" the author decided that her hair should either be in a bowl cut or in pigtails, and after watching that anime he decided on a bowl cut.<ref>Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (15) Sanj\u014d Tsubame,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 5.

He is gunned down by Kanry\u016b's Gatling gun trying to help save Aoshi.{{gnr|ch|28}} In the anime only, one of his darts jams Kanry\u016b's Gatling gun. Watsuki stated that Beshimi was \"largely created on-the-spot\" and does not have a motif. He said that without a personality set for him, the character turned out \"kind of timid.\" Not originally intended to be a standalone character, Beshimi became shorter than Kenshin to add variety to the Oniwabansh\u016b. Watsuki said that Beshimi's shortness and timidness gave him a group of fans who wrote to him calling the character \"cute.\"<ref name=\"WatsukiBeshimi\"/>\n\n====Hyottoko====\n{{Anime voices|[[Sh\u014dz\u014d Iizuka]]|[[Bob Papenbrook]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|Hyottoko|\u706b\u7537}} is the large and fat member of the Oniwabansh\u016b.

The creator made Hyottoko fat since he wanted the Oniwabansh\u016b to represent several shapes and sizes and because the character would have a bag of oil in his stomach. Watsuki said that since he had never drawn a figure like that before, he went through several designs until he found one he could draw comfortably and repeatedly. Watsuki decided to give Hyottoko the ability to breathe fire, because he felt it would be natural for an \"onmitsu\" to be \"flashy.\" Looking back, the author saw the character as somewhat out of place and \"not really organic\" to his world. According to Watsuki the fire breathing and Kenshin's sword spinning method to defeat Hyottoko's fire-breathing received criticism from fans, authors of [[d\u014djinshi]] [[fanzine]]s, and personal friends. The author described Hyottoko as \"the guy who makes a big entrance and then gets just as spectacularly beaten,\" whose \"ridiculously confident\" and \"a bit of an idiot\", but that that is just the \"natural evolution of the character, I guess.\"<ref name=\"HyottokoProfile\"/>\n\n====Han'nya====\n{{Anime voices|[[Akio Nojima]]|[[Tom Wyner]]}}\n\n{{nihongo|Han'nya|\u822c\u82e5|[[Hannya]]}} is a skilled martial artist and was the master of intelligence for the Edo Castle Oniwabansh\u016b.{{gnr|ch|23}} In the poor village he was born in, it is common to abandon a child at birth to reduce the number of people to feed. Han'nya survived and wandered around like an animal until Aoshi found him and trained him to be an Oniwabansh\u016b.{{gnr|ch|24}} Thus he is extremely loyal to Aoshi, giving his life to allow Kenshin enough time to retrieve his sword to defeat Kanry\u016b and save Aoshi.{{gnr|ch|28}} His arms have horizontal stripes painted on them, which gives them the appearance of being shorter than they actually are, thus luring opponents into a false sense of security regarding distance of attacks.{{gnr|ch|23}} He also wears steel gauntlets beneath his gloves, which help him to block attacks from other weapons.{{gnr|ch|23}} These gauntlets contain retractable steel claws, which he will resort to as a sort of trump card.{{gnr|ch|24}} Han'nya is also the master of disguise within the group; he gained his ability by removing all his prominent facial features, which is why he wears the demonic mask on his face. Han'nya burned his lips, cut off his ears and nose, and crushed his cheekbones so he could disguise himself as any individual.{{gnr|ch|24}} After the Bakumatsu, Han'nya received no prosperous government job offers because of his appearance.{{gnr|ch|28}}\n\nWatsuki was originally going to base Han'nya off of the \"[[Joseph Merrick|Elephant Man]]\"; intending for his face to be deformed because a person stepped on it while he was still in his mother's womb.<ref name=\"Han'nya\">Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (10) Oniwabansh\u016b \u25cf Han'nya,\" ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' Volume 4.

Han'nya would join the Oniwabansh\u016b, becoming a tragic figure who finds his [[wikt:raison d'\u00eatre|raison d'\u00eatre]] in fighting, saying \"Only in the Oniwabansh\u016b am I able to live as a human being.\" Watsuki and his editor discussed how this could be interpreted meaning \"the shape of one's destiny is determined by how one is born\" and whether or not this would be appropriate for a young men's magazine. Watsuki decided a change needed to be made and said that for him Han'nya was a difficult character as it made him aware of the responsibilities of writing for young people. Han'nya's personality is derived from [[Yamazaki Susumu]], a member of the Shinsengumi. Some readers proposed that Han'nya had a handsome face under his mask, was Aoshi's ''[[kagemusha]]'' (such as his twin brother), or was a ''[[kunoichi]]''. The design model for Han'nya was a human skeleton.

Aoshi gave Shikij\u014d a chance to join the Oniwabansh\u016b and gain strength using their training methods and medicines.{{gnr|ch|25}} Shikij\u014d received no prosperous government job offers because he was a traitor.{{gnr|ch|28}} Shikij\u014d is mainly a hand-to-hand fighter but he also swings around a large ball and chain.

He is the first to die at Kanry\u016b's hand, protecting Aoshi from the Gatling gun.{{gnr|ch|28}} Watsuki said that he modeled Shikij\u014d after Sanosuke by giving Shikij\u014d the same philosophy, strength, and personality. By putting them on opposite sides Watsuki intended to illustrate the differences between the two factions. Watsuki created Shikij\u014d as a complete villain, but said that the \"noble manner\" of his death made the character \"a pretty cool guy.\" The author used no specific model for Shikij\u014d's design; giving him many muscles as the character is a \"power fighter,\" but feeling that Shikij\u014d was not sufficiently \"strange-enough looking,\" Watsuki added scars and \"superhero-like exaggerated musculature.\"<ref name=\"Shikij\u014d\"/>\n\n====Okina====\n{{Anime voices|[[Koichi Kitamura]]|[[Michael McConnohie]] (TV Series), Marty Fleck (''New Kyoto Arc'')}}\n\n{{nihongo|Kashiwazaki Nenji|\u67cf\u5d0e \u5ff5\u81f3}}, also known as {{nihongo|Okina|\u7fc1}}, was a member of the Oniwabansh\u016b during the Bakumatsu.

Watsuki supposes that a bit of the character Kohei from [[Sh\u014dtar\u014d Ikenami]]'s ''Kenkyaku Sh\u014dbai'' is in Okina. The author said that he likes Okina since as a character he was able to \"tie up loose ends.\" Okina's design model is Tokijir\u014d Kaiz\u014d from Takeshi Obata's ''Cyborg Jii-chan G''. Watsuki said that while he was careful to not make Okina look too similar to his influence, his assistants guessed the design model right away. He expressed disappointment with Okina's hair; he intended for it to stand up when Okina is very angry, making him resemble \"Sally's dad from the anime.\" Because of a lack of available pages, Watsuki concluded \"this hasn't ended up coming across too well.\"<ref>[[Nobuhiro Watsuki|Watsuki, Nobuhiro]]. \"The Secret Life of Characters (31) Okina (Kashiwazaki Nenji),\" ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' Volume 11.

He is then revealed to be the father of Yukishiro Tomoe and Enishi.{{gnr|ch|225}} He is aware that Tomoe has died and that Kenshin was her husband. Geezer is last seen with the broken Enishi in the Fallen Village; father and son remark that each other looks familiar, though it is left unknown whether either knows their connection.{{gnr|ch|251}}\n\nWatsuki based Geezer off of an empty milk can who is a character in \"Now go, Robot!,\" a story by Makoto \u014cishi. The motif of the entire plotline involving Kenshin in the Fallen Village is based on that same story, with it also taking influence from the comic ''[[Silver Surfer]]'' by [[Jean Giraud|Moebius]]. Watsuki used no design model for Geezer. He was created simply based on the attributes; homeless, \"an unusual personality,\" and not easily showing his true thoughts. Afterwards, Watsuki noticed that Geezer was very similar to Grandpa Bob in ''B\u00f8y'' by [[Haruto Umezawa]].<ref>Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (48) Geezer,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 25.

Before he leaves, however, Yahiko confronts him, scorns his sulking, and tells him that he can overcome his sorrow by working to be better than he imagined Raijuta to be. Yutaro responds that he will never stop practicing swordsmanship and his left arm is still enough to become great.{{gnr|ch|44}} At the end of the series, Yutar\u014d's name is listed as one of the acting instructors of the ''Kamiya Kasshin-ry\u016b'' dojo, along with Yahiko.{{gnr|ch|255}}\n\nIn the anime Yutar\u014d's father, a well-known swordsman, is dead. Yutar\u014d, who had inherited a lot of money after his parents died, wishes to learn swordsmanship to become as skilled as his father. When he sees Kenshin, he demands lessons on how to use a sword, but Kenshin refuses. Yutar\u014d finds Raij\u016bta, who plans to overthrow the Meiji government. During a scuffle one of Raij\u016bta's men accidentally hits Yutar\u014d, causing him to fall into the ocean. After Kenshin rescues him Yutaro gets to know Kenshin's group. In a similar manner Raij\u016bta injures Yutar\u014d's right arm, and Yutar\u014d goes to Germany for medical treatment.\n\nWatsuki created Yutar\u014d as Yahiko's rival with no real model; while they both want to be stronger, their desires come the complete opposite places. He gave Yutar\u014d the traits of admiring Kaoru, an older woman, and Kenshin's strength but made him unable to \"be honest\" about it because they were Raij\u016bta's enemies, as aspects of his youth. Watsuki said that Yutar\u014d is one of the \"good guys\" but because he was \"brought down a bit\" by the author's \"most disgraceful character\" (Raij\u016bta) he may not have been developed \"to his full extent.\" Yutar\u014d's design is also the opposite of Yahiko. Watsuki initially had difficulty with his hair, but once he got used to it, it became easy and he enjoyed drawing it. He also had difficulty in compensating for Yutar\u014d's black-less design on the page, which if he was not careful, would go all white.<ref>Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (17) Tsukayama Yutar\u014d,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 6.

He asks Kenshin to go to Kyoto and kill Shishio for the sake of the country.{{gnr|ch|55}} Returning a week later for Kenshin's answer, \u014ckubo is assassinated by Seta S\u014djir\u014d with seven [[Ishikawa Prefecture]] samurai taking responsibility.{{gnr|ch|56}}\n\nWatsuki feels that many Japanese people have bias towards [[Saig\u014d Takamori]] with \u014ckubo being thought of as \"sly\" and \"cunning.\" The author expressed disappointment in this and instead stated that while \u014ckubo was indeed a strategist during the Bakumatsu, he was ethical during the Meiji era and did not try to enrich himself personally through politics (like Saig\u014d did). Watsuki feels that \u014ckubo, who had been demonized during his time period, is an example of what a politician should be and needs more appreciation from the population. For his design, Watsuki wanted to use portrait photographs of \u014ckubo, but could not find them. So he tried using a statue as a model, but believes that the final product does not look at all similar to the statue. In retrospect he believes that the character resembles [[President of the United States]] [[Abraham Lincoln]], another historical figure that Watsuki has respect for.<ref>Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (22) \u014ckubo Toshimichi,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 7.

Although he bears an uncanny resemblance to Kenshin, he is more fond of his mother and less caring towards his father (he has a habit of pulling Kenshin's hair).{{gnr|ch|255}} He also appears in ''Yahiko no Sakabat\u014d'', where he is about four years old and is seen training with a shinai.\n\nWatsuki said that \"stupid\" was Kenji's personality model, and described him as equivalent to Arai Iori. The author said that Kenji exists solely to be the son of Kenshin and Kaoru, and even though the character was \"clich\u00e9\", he felt that Kenji had to appear. The author said that he is not \"twisted enough\" to place \"negative elements in the ideal family.\" Kenji's character design is \"a small Kenshin.\"<ref name=\"KenjiDesign\">Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (54) Himura Kenji and the rest of the 15th Year of Meiji,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 28.

Like Sanosuke, he was a child soldier of the Sekih\u014d Army.{{gnr|ch|45}} For the past ten years he has cursed the Meiji government and created a cache of grenades to blow up the department of internal affairs.{{gnr|ch|46}} He recruits Sanosuke and they embark on their terrorist attack, but are stopped by Kenshin. After Kenshin buries his bombs, Tsukioka stops painting and starts his own newspaper to report the government's wrongdoings.{{gnr|ch|47}} However, he still makes bombs solely as protection and gave several to Sanosuke just before he followed Kenshin to Kyoto.{{gnr|ch|58|, |101}} In the anime series, he becomes a valuable source of information for Kenshin and Sanosuke, serving as their intelligence source during the Feng Shui arc.\n\nWatsuki said that Tsunan originated from a fake advertisement within the series, labeled \"Mysterious Artist Appears.\" When he decided to do the extra Sanosuke chapters he created a \"comrade from the Sekih\u014d Army \u2014 lone explosive expert plotting overthrow of the government.\" But felt that this alone did not give Tsunan \"interesting\" qualities, so he added the \"fake artist\" trait. Due to exhaustion and scheduling issues, the arc became three chapters instead of the planned four and Watsuki said some parts did not get fully developed as a result. The author expressed a desire to use Tsunan at a later point in the series since he is the sole character with a \"mass media\" connection and therefore could have further uses. Despite the fact that Tsunan is \"a little depressing,\" Watsuki likes Tsunan's \"straightforward personality.\" Tsunan had no design model. Due to a lack of time Watsuki adapted an earlier concept of a man with dreadlocks, which \"to my surprise, turned out to be just right.\" After making some \"tweaks\" the design assembled \"quickly,\" with the [[bandanna]] and the \"oddly patterned\" jacket added to give him \"artist-y\" clothing.<ref name=\"TsunanDesign\">[[Nobuhiro Watsuki|Watsuki, Nobuhiro]]. \"The Secret Life of Characters (19) Tsukioka Tsunan,\" ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' Volume 6.

Eiji tries to kill the unconscious Senkaku with a sword, but Sait\u014d stops him so the police can question Senkaku.{{gnr|ch|71}} When Eiji insists that Senkaku needs to be killed for his family's honor, Kenshin tells him that his dead family wants him to be happy, not for him to kill someone. Sait\u014d arranges for his wife, Tokio (\u6642\u5c3e), to care for Eiji in the near future.{{gnr|ch|71}} Watsuki created Eiji between the tragedy in Shingetsu village and the concept of a new beginning, and with the main theme of revenge. In retrospect, the author said that the plot pulled Eiji around and therefore could not develop as a character. Watsuki felt the design looked too similar to Yahiko.<ref>[[Nobuhiro Watsuki|Watsuki, Nobuhiro]]. \"The Secret Life of Characters (27) Mishima Eiji,\" ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' Volume 9.

As a child soldier underneath S\u014dz\u014d, Sanosuke looked up to him greatly; hence he took S\u014dz\u014d's family name as his own and became Sagara Sanosuke.{{gnr|ch|7}} Supporters of the revolution, the Sekih\u014d Army traveled the countryside spreading news about the upcoming change of regime, such as tax cuts. The Meiji government could not keep the promise and so used the Sekih\u014d Army as scapegoats, denouncing them as a \"false army.\"{{gnr|ch|7}} S\u014dz\u014d was decapitated when he reported to the commanding general and his head was placed on a platform in a cage for all to see,{{gnr|ch|7}} haunting Sanosuke for many years and causing his embitterment towards the Meiji government. In the anime, S\u014dz\u014d died of fatal gunshot wounds while protecting Sanosuke.\n\nAlthough a historical figure, Watsuki's own mental image of Sagara S\u014dz\u014d ended up taking precedence; according to the author, S\u014dz\u014d genuinely wanted equality for Japan's people. With him being depicted within the framework of Sanosuke's memories, S\u014dz\u014d ends up being glorified in the story. Watsuki debated whether to include the Sekih\u014d Army Incident due to its obscurity. But because he believed that it exposed the truths and lies of the Meiji Restoration, he decided to include it. He did say that the series' popularity fell to its lowest point during this storyline, as of ''Rurouni Kenshin'' volume two, but repeated that leaving it out was not an option. With no actual historic photographs of S\u014dz\u014d to use as a design, the character became popular \"in the eyes (and hearts) of female readers.\"<ref name=\"SecretLife5Sagara S\u014dz\u014d\">Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (5) Sagara S\u014dz\u014d,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 2.

Seik\u016b's father {{nihongo|Shakk\u016b|\u8d64\u7a7a}} was the swordsmith who made Kenshin's sakabat\u014d. Kenshin seeks Shakk\u016b out in Kyoto for a replacement and learns he is dead, but that his son is still alive and learned everything he knew. With his sakabat\u014d broken, Kenshin asks Seik\u016b to make a new sword, but Seik\u016b refuses because he wants to live a peaceful life in the Meiji era and does not want to make anymore weapons.{{gnr|ch|75}} Wanting Shakk\u016b's final sword, Sawagej\u014d Ch\u014d kidnaps Iori and uses him as a hostage until Azusa reveals that it was offered to the Hakusan Shrine as a \"godsword.\"{{gnr|ch|77}} With Kenshin about to lose to Ch\u014d without a sword, Seik\u016b entrusts his father's last sword to Kenshin, who immediately uses it to defeat Ch\u014d; to everyone's surprise the sword is also a sakabat\u014d.{{gnr|ch|80|, |81}}\n\nWatsuki said that he had \"lots of different things in my mind\" when he created the family, but that he forgot many of them. He said that Iori symbolizes peace, Seik\u016b demonstrates selfishness demonstrated by fathers, and Azusa \"uh... holds it all together?\" Iori's design originated from \"a fairly famous women's manga involving babies.\" Watsuki said that he created the father and mother \"on the spot.\" Watsuki felt that Seik\u016b's design in the end \"kind of\" looked similar to Takeda Kanry\u016b, and so concluded that the design \"didn't turn out quite right.\" But admitted that he also initially thought Azusa was \"not quite right\" until changing his mind, feeling \"she's a really good character.\" The author added that he found it \"refreshing\" that Azusa is the first female character he designed who shows her entire forehead. Watsuki was planning to have Seik\u016b's family reappear later in the Kyoto arc with Yahiko as the lead character in the story.<ref name=\"Seik\u016bFamilydesign\">[[Nobuhiro Watsuki|Watsuki, Nobuhiro]]. \"The Secret Life of Characters (30) Seik\u016b's Family,\" ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' Volume 10.

His father, {{nihongo|Higashidani Kamishimoemon|\u6771\u8c37 \u4e0a\u4e0b\u30a7\u9580}}, is a farmer adept at fighting with his fists and who has fended off Fud\u014dsawa from taking over the village. {{nihongo|Uki|\u53f3\u559c}} is his younger sister, and {{nihongo|\u014cta|\u592e\u592a}} is his younger brother.{{gnr|ch|229}} Their mother, {{nihongo|Naname|\u83dc\u3005\u82bd}}, died around four years after the birth of \u014cta due to a cold.{{gnr|ch|231}} Uki became protective of her little brother because Sanosuke left them and because her mother died, so she was afraid of losing other family members.{{gnr|ch|234}} As a result, \u014cta was sheltered. After learning about Sanosuke's deeds \u014cta becomes willing to fight. At the end of the series, \u014cta's name is listed as a student at Kaoru's dojo.{{gnr|ch|255}}\n\nWatsuki said that he always had some idea of what Sanosuke's family would be like, and therefore formed the Higashidani family along those concepts. Kamishimoemon is what Sanosuke will be like when he is older, Uki is very \"lively\" and protective of others, and \u014cta is the opposite of Sanosuke, a weak little boy. Watsuki felt that the story was a little unsatisfactory because he was tired from the previous storyline and therefore unable to concentrate. In retrospect, he said he should have chosen either Uki or \u014cta and made it only a three-person family. However, the author said that illustrating the family was fun and that he liked challenging himself with a whole family. Watsuki had no models for the visual designs of the characters. Kamishimoemon originated from a concept of an aged Sanosuke that was considered for the final ''Rurouni Kenshin'' chapter. He described Uki as just a \"modern, easy to draw type.\" \u014cta is a \"typical Watsuki image\" of a weak child from a rural area who has cheeks with circle marks. Watsuki intended for designs that would be drawn quickly, but found it difficult and as they evolved he decided that he needed to study images of real people.<ref>Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (50) Higashidani Family,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 26.
