Short plays were unfashionable in the theatre of the 1920s and 30s, but Coward was fond of the genre and conceived the idea of a group of one-act or otherwise brief pieces to be played across several evenings. The actress most closely associated with him was [[Gertrude Lawrence]], and he wrote the ten plays as vehicles for them both.\n\n''Shadow Play'' was first produced in 1935 in [[Manchester]] and then toured for nine weeks before opening in  London (1936) and New York (1936\u20131937), where it played to full houses. It has enjoyed several major revivals and has been adapted for television.\n\nThe play depicts a husband and wife in a marriage on the brink of collapse. Under the influence of an unwisely large dose of sleeping pills, the wife has a dream that retells their story in hallucinatory form. Musical intervals weave in and out of the dream. The husband is so concerned for his wife's condition that his love is rekindled, and when she comes round they are reconciled.\n\n==Background and first productions==\nShort plays had been popular in the previous century, often as [[curtain-raiser]]s to longer plays; by the 1920s they had gone out of fashion, but Coward was fond of the genre. He wrote, \"A short play, having a great advantage over a long one in that it can sustain a mood without technical creaking or over padding, deserves a better fate, and if, by careful writing, acting and producing I can do a little towards reinstating it in its rightful pride, I shall have achieved one of my more sentimental ambitions.\"<ref>''Quoted'' in Morley, p. 66</ref> In 1935 he conceived the idea of a set of nine short plays, to run in varying permutations on three consecutive nights at the theatre. His biographer [[Philip Hoare]] describes it as \"a bold idea, risky and innovative\".<ref>Hoare, p. 268</ref>\n\nThe actress most closely associated with Coward was [[Gertrude Lawrence]], his oldest friend, with whom he has starred in his comedy ''[[Private Lives]]'' in 1930\u201331,<ref>Morley, (2013), p. viii; and Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 209 and 217</ref> and he wrote the ''Tonight at 8.30'' plays \"as acting, singing and dancing vehicles for Gertrude Lawrence and myself\".<ref>''Quoted'' in Mander and Mitchenson, p. 283</ref> Coward directed the plays as well as acting in them. They were performed in various combinations of three.{{refn|The plays chosen for each performance were announced in advance, although a myth evolved that the groupings were random.<ref>\"Phoenix Theatre\", ''[[The Times]]'', 20 January 1936, p. 10; 11 February 1936, p. 12; 2 March 1936, p. 12; 6 April 1936, p. 10; 2 May 1936, p. 12; 10 June 1936, p. 14.</ref>|group=n}}  ''Shadow Play'' was first presented on 18 October 1935 at the [[Manchester Opera House|Opera House, Manchester]], the final play in a programme that also contained ''[[Hands Across the Sea (play)|Hands Across the Sea]]'' and ''[[Fumed Oak]]''.<ref>Mander and Mitchenson, p. 282</ref>\n\nThe first London performance was on 18 January 1936 at the [[Phoenix Theatre (London)|Phoenix Theatre]].<ref name=times>\"Phoenix Theatre\", ''The Times'', 19 January 1936, p. 15.</ref> The production ran for a limited season, playing to full houses, but ending after three months.<ref>Morley (1974), p. 192</ref>{{refn|Coward, who disliked long runs, and also needed to set aside time to write and compose,<ref>Morley (1974), pp. 94\u201395</ref> usually insisted on playing a part for no longer than three months.<ref>Hoare, p. 155</ref>|group=n}} The Broadway premiere was at the [[Nederlander Theatre|National Theatre]] on 27 November 1936.

They have been to the theatre together, but Vicky refuses to accompany Martha to a party because Simon Gayforth, her husband, is sure to be there with Sybil Heston, to whom he somewhat attached. Vicky intends to go to bed, and takes three strong sleeping tablets. Her admirer Michael Doyle, rings up, and she tells him brusquely to to call back tomorrow as she is too tired to talk now.\n\nSimon comes to tell Martha that George, her husband, is waiting impatiently for her. Simon too has decided not to go to the party, and he asks the Cunninghams to make his excuses for him. When they have gone he begins a serious conversation with his wife: he asks her to divorce him. She agrees, noting sadly that they have been married for just five years. The sleeping tablets begin to take effect making her head swim. The action becomes confused and dreamlike, and is evidently seen through Vicky's drugged eyes. Music is heard; it stops and then starts again. Simon dances a few steps. The music becomes more insistent. Simon and Vicky sing a duet, \"Then\" about transitory joy. This is followed by a second song, \"Play, Orchestra, Play\" (\"We Must Have Music\"). The lights fade to nothing. Sybil Heston appears in a pool of light, telling Simon that they must let Vicky know the truth; they are joined by Michael Doyle, who asks them to give her his love. The lights fade on a reprise of \"Play, Orchestra, Play\".\n\nThe scene changes to a moonlit garden. We see the first meeting of Vicky and Simon, at a country ball. Their dialogue is a mixture of what they said at the time and their current comments on it:\n:Vicky: What do you do?\n:Simon: I'm in a bank.\n:Vicky: High up in a bank? Or just sitting in a cage totting up things?\n:Simon: Oh, quite high up, really. It's a very good bank.\n:Vicky: I'm so glad.\n:Simon: How lovely you are.\n:Vicky: No, no, that came later \u2013 you've skipped some.\n:Simon: Sorry.\n:Vicky: You're nice and thin \u2013 your eyes are funny \u2013 you move easily \u2013 I'm afraid you're terribly attractive.\n:Simon: You never said that.\n:Vicky: No, but I thought it.\n:Simon: Stick to the script.\nThey sing a duet, \"You Were There,\" finishing in each other's arms in a spotlight. The dreamlike mood continues. Lena is seen spotlit, carrying sleeping tablets and a glass of water, and singing \"Then\". In another pool of light, Martha and George are seen in a car discussing the Gayforths' matrimonial troubles: Vicky runs on and accuses them of \"spoiling it all\". There follow hallucinatory images of the Gayforths' honeymoon journey to Venice and a noisy nightclub where Sybil Heston and Michael Doyle dance together in a brilliant spotlight. Another spotlight picks up Vicky and Simon, and the two couples dance on, constantly switching partners, faster and faster, as voices from the darkness rhythmically chant the names of night-clubs: \"The Florida, The Cocoanut Grove, The Four Hundred, The Blue Train\". The noise crescendos and then stops suddenly, with a blackout.\n\nLena, spotlit, is seen telephoning Martha asking her to come back because Vicky is suffering from an overdose of sleeping tablets and Simon is alarmed about her. In the final scene the lighting returns to normal. Simon, Lena and Martha are at Vicky's bedside, giving her black coffee. Simon tells her, when she asks for explanations, that, under the influence of the drug, \"you just went mad, that's all \u2013 raving \u2026 you began dancing about the room\". Deciding that Vicky is now safe, the others leave her alone with Simon. When she asks him about the divorce, he declares that he wants nothing of the sort; everything is all right again between them. He lifts her on to the bed, covers her over with the counterpane, and lies down on the sofa at her feet.\n\n==Revivals and adaptations==\n===Theatre===\n\nIn 1937 a company led by [[Estelle Winwood]] and [[Robert Henderson (actor)| Robert Henderson]] toured the ''Tonight at 8.30'' cycle in the US and Canada.

It was reprised by me later in the show while Gertie was scrambling breathlessly into a grey bouffant dress in the quick-change room at the side of the stage.

It is arguably Australia's most famous steam locomotive, being the only one to have visited all mainland states and territories.\n\n==Construction==\n3801 was built in 1943 by [[Clyde Engineering]] as the first of 30 [[New South Wales C38 class locomotive|38 class]] locomotives built to haul express trains. The first five were built by Clyde Engineering to a [[Streamliner|streamlined]] design, whilst the 25 post-war locomotives in the class were built by the NSWGR themselves at [[Eveleigh Railway Workshops|Eveleigh]] and [[Cardiff Locomotive Workshops]] and were unstreamlined.\n\nThe 38 class were first conceived in 1938. They suffered many delays during construction due to material shortages caused by [[World War II]]. 3801 was the first engine completed late 1942 and entered service on 22 January 1943 to little fanfare. It became known at the time as the ''Grey Nurse'' due to its drab, all grey colour scheme, a wartime camouflage scheme. \n\n==In service==\n[[File:Railway Station - Stanmore (2715093301).jpg|thumb|left|3801 passes through [[Stanmore railway station, Sydney|Stanmore]] in 1945]]\nOn 25 February 1943, 3801 worked the ''[[Newcastle Flyer]]'' for the first time.<ref name=Roundhouse>\"The 38 Class\" ''[[Roundhouse (periodical)|Roundhouse]]\" July 1981 pages 22\u201329</ref> When joined by 3802 in April 1943, these engines were allotted to working the ''Melbourne Limited'' expresses between [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney]] and [[Goulburn railway station|Goulburn]]. In early 1947 3801 was given a heavy overhaul and was painted in its standard colour scheme of green with yellow lining. A [[Waratah]] emblem was added to the top of the nose cone in later years. In 1955 3801 was overhauled again, being painted black with red lining as a cost-cutting measure. It was around this time that [[diesel locomotive]]s started appearing on the rails of NSW. These would take the \"glamour workings\" away from the 38 class, the intention being to replace steam with diesel power, and to confine even modern steam to all-stations passenger and even goods trains. This intention was not realised until the end of steam on the NSWGR in 1972, as the available diesels were unable to match the speed performance of the 38's. In December 1956 3801 was the first in its class to accrue 1 million miles (1.61 million kilometres).\n\nIn early 1963 3801 was given a major overhaul during which it was repainted green. It was often used on special services operated by railway heritage organisations, the most famous being a non-stop run from Sydney to [[Newcastle railway station, New South Wales|Newcastle]] on 28 June 1964. Just failing to break the two-hour barrier, this remained the fastest journey from Sydney to Newcastle by rail (2 hours 1 minute 51 seconds) until bettered by an [[New South Wales XPT|XPT]] in 1988.<ref>\"New Newcastle Speed Record\" ''[[Railway Digest]]'' December 1988 page 437</ref> On the return journey 3801 again fell just short of the two-hour mark. In October 1965 the locomotive was found to have serious [[boiler]] problems, so was withdrawn and placed in the care of the [[NSW Rail Museum|New South Wales Rail Transport Museum]]. The museum contributed $18,000 to return 3801 to service and the boiler from 3819 was fitted. In October 1966 3801 returned to service, however the following year boiler problems re-emerged and the loco was withdrawn. Another boiler exam gave the loco a reprieve and allowed it to return to service. During this time it operated a train celebrating the 25th anniversary of the ''[[Newcastle Flyer]]'' on 31 May 1969, as well as the ''[[Western Endeavour]]'' special across the continent to [[Perth]] between 22 August and 12 September 1970.<ref name=Roundhouse/> In October 1972, 3801 worked to [[South Australia]] with [[3642]] as part of celebrations to open the [[Whyalla railway line|Whyalla line]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bayley|first1=William|title=Steel Wheels on Railway to Whyalla|date=1973|publisher=Austrail Publications|location=Bulli|isbn=0 909597 12 X}}</ref><ref name=Enviro>[http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=4807230 Locomotive, Steam 3801] NSW Environment & Heritage</ref>\n\nFrom April 1974 under the [[Public Transport Commission]] all steam trains were barred from New South Wales main lines, however during June and July of that year 3801 was allowed back to be used as the star of the award-winning film ''[[A Steam Train Passes]]''.\n\n==Preservation==\n[[File:3801 walsh island.jpg|thumb|3801 under restoration at the [[State Dockyard]]]]\n[[File:3801 (NSW steam locomotive) 2.JPG|thumb|3801 at [[Lithgow railway station|Lithgow station]] in January 2006]]\n[[File:3801 Wagga Wagga.jpg|thumb|3801 at [[Wagga Wagga railway station|Wagga Wagga station]] in June 2006 with a recreation of its original ''Grey Nurse'' colour scheme]]\n3801 returned to service on 6 January 1975, operating services on the [[Bankstown railway line|Bankstown line]] to help raise money for survivors of [[Cyclone Tracy]]. After this 3801 was deeded to the Rail Transport Museum.  In June 1975, it hauled [[New South Wales D57 class locomotive|5711]] and [[New South Wales Z19 class locomotive|1905]] to [[Thirlmere railway station|Thirlmere]] when the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum relocated.<ref>\"Museum on the Move\" ''Roundhouse'' June 1976 page 16</ref> The engine was then used on tours until December 1976, when boiler problems led to its withdrawal.\n\nIn November 1982 [[David Hill (businessman)|David Hill]] [[Chief Executive]] of the [[State Rail Authority]] enquired about the suitability of restoring 3801. Hill had the 1988 [[Australian Bicentenary|Bicentenary]] of British settlement in Australia in mind, and saw a restored 3801 as a representative of Australia's railways. The boiler was the major item needing repair and an investigation needed to be carried out to ascertain if restoration was viable. A visit was made to the [[South Maitland Railway]]s (who at the time still used steam engines) to learn about modern boiler techniques. It was discovered that many advances had been made and it was possible to return boilers to service which previously would have been scrapped. The next step was to examine the boilers of the other preserved 38 class members \u2013 [[3820]] and [[3830]] (though 3813 had survived, it was completely stripped and in two different locations) \u2013 and compare them with 3801's boiler. It was decided to use the boiler already in 3801, however, the inner firebox had suffered thermal fractures and would need extensive repairs. Restoration was deemed possible and a fund-raising appeal began.\n\nWith some finance raised, 3801 was taken to the [[State Dockyard]] in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] on 20 November 1983 for restoration by the Hunter Valley Training Company \u2013 an apprenticeship scheme later involved in the restoration of 3830. This was due to the railway's workshops being stretched by regular work. It was marshalled behind [[New South Wales 81 class locomotive|8111]] on an excursion train from [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney]].<ref>\"3801 Welcome back\" ''Railway Digest'' December 1986 pages 363\u2013366</ref>\n\nThe firebox was to be completely replaced, however, the dies and jigs used to press the boiler metal had been scrapped, so the old firebox was used as a template. The new firebox had a different shape and this reduced the boiler pressure from 245 psi to 215 psi. It was decided to weld the new firebox and some conservative engineers were sceptical as to whether this would work. Repairs and reconditioning of many other components were also carried out. The [[Tender locomotive|tender]] tank was so rusted, it needed to be replaced. The new tank was welded rather than riveted and this resulted in a sleek, plain tender. On 8 November 1986, a fire was lit for the first time. By 10 November 3801 was running around nearby sidings. More short trials followed and on 15 November 3801 was handed over and hauled a train to [[Maitland railway station|Maitland]]. More trial runs followed and on 29 November 1986, 3801 headed from Newcastle to a grand ball on the concourse of [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney Central station]].<ref>\"Re-Commissioning 3801 15th November 1986\" ''Railway Digest'' January 1987 page 30</ref>\n\nAfter restoration 3801 operated heritage trains throughout New South Wales. It was operated by [[3801 Limited]] under a 20-year lease. During the [[Australian Bicentenary]] celebrations in 1988, it operated an extensive program across Australia visiting every mainland capital accessible by rail including another trip to Perth in April/May 1988.<ref>\"3801 West\" ''Railway Digest'' July 1988 page 250</ref> In October 1988, [[LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman|''Flying Scotsman'']] arrived from England and for much of its year-long tour across Australia was accompanied by 3801.<ref name=Enviro/>\n\nOn 6 May 1990, 3801 was involved in the [[Cowan rail disaster]]. 3801 was struggling to climb the [[Cowan Bank]] (on the Sydney side of the [[Hawkesbury River]]) when returning from the Morpeth Jazz Festival when a [[CityRail]] [[NSW TrainLink V set|Interurban]] passenger service crashed into the back of 3801's train. Six people lost their lives, including the driver of the intercity electric, and a passenger in the V set's cab. 3801 applied sand to the track to assist grip and an investigation into the crash suggested this may have caused the signals to malfunction. The signals changed from red to green several times. After the signals were green for a few moments, the interurban driver then entered the tunnel behind 3801 where the accident occurred. The handbrake in one of the carriages may also have been applied.<ref>{{cite web|work=Emergency NSW | title=Cowan 1990| url=http://www.emergency.nsw.gov.au/content.php/647.html|accessdate=8 December 2007\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002120830/http://www.emergency.nsw.gov.au/content.php/647.html\n|archivedate=2 October 2013\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=Australian Emergency Management|title=Transport \u2013 Brooklyn Train Collision|url=http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=40|accessdate=8 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714180333/http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=40|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992 3801 visited [[Alice Springs railway station|Alice Springs]] for the first time, using the standard gauge track laid in 1980. The locomotive was awarded an Historic Engineering Marker plaque by Engineers Australia on 6 November 1994, the ceremony taking place at [[Robertson railway station|Robertson]]. 3801 was a regular at the [[Hunter Valley Steamfest]].\n\nDespite a campaign by 3801 Limited to retain custodianship of the locomotive, on 26 November 2006 the custodianship passed back to the [[NSW Rail Museum|New South Wales Rail Transport Museum]]. The locomotive continued to haul day trips and longer excursions until withdrawn from service for a major overhaul at the end of 2007.\n\n==2008\u20132020 overhaul==\nWhen 3801 was withdrawn in 2007, it was decided to replace the original boiler with a new welded one as well as conducting various mechanical repairs.<ref>{{cite web| work=Office of Rail Heritage | title=Office of Rail Heritage \u2013 Projects| url=http://www.nswrailheritage.com.au/orhprojects.htm| accessdate=1 May 2009}}</ref> This was timetabled to be complete by the end of 2010. The contract for the construction of the new boiler was let to [[Meiningen Steam Locomotive Works|Dampflokwerk Meiningen]] in Germany, while the tender tank was transferred to the Hunter Valley Training Company at Maitland for repair.\n\nIn 2010, the new boiler arrived in Australia.

It is arguably Australia's most famous steam locomotive, being the only one to have visited all mainland states and territories.\n\n==Construction==\n3801 was built in 1943 by [[Clyde Engineering]] as the first of 30 [[New South Wales C38 class locomotive|38 class]] locomotives built to haul express trains. The first five were built by Clyde Engineering to a [[Streamliner|streamlined]] design, whilst the 25 post-war locomotives in the class were built by the NSWGR themselves at [[Eveleigh Railway Workshops|Eveleigh]] and [[Cardiff Locomotive Workshops]] and were unstreamlined.\n\nThe 38 class were first conceived in 1938. They suffered many delays during construction due to material shortages caused by [[World War II]]. 3801 was the first engine completed late 1942 and entered service on 22 January 1943 to little fanfare. It became known at the time as the ''Grey Nurse'' due to its drab, all grey colour scheme, a wartime camouflage scheme. \n\n==In service==\n[[File:Railway Station - Stanmore (2715093301).jpg|thumb|left|3801 passes through [[Stanmore railway station, Sydney|Stanmore]] in 1945]]\nOn 25 February 1943, 3801 worked the ''[[Newcastle Flyer]]'' for the first time.<ref name=Roundhouse>\"The 38 Class\" ''[[Roundhouse (periodical)|Roundhouse]]\" July 1981 pages 22-29</ref> When joined by 3802 in April 1943, these engines were allotted to working the ''Melbourne Limited'' expresses between [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney]] and [[Goulburn railway station|Goulburn]]. In early 1947 3801 was given a heavy overhaul and was painted in its standard colour scheme of green with yellow lining. A [[Waratah]] emblem was added to the top of the nose cone in later years. In 1955 3801 was overhauled again, being painted black with red lining as a cost-cutting measure. It was around this time that [[diesel locomotive]]s started appearing on the rails of NSW. These would take the \"glamour workings\" away from the 38 class, the intention being to replace steam with diesel power, and to confine even modern steam to all-stations passenger and even goods trains. This intention was not realised until the end of steam on the NSWGR in 1972, as the available diesels were unable to match the speed performance of the 38's. In December 1956 3801 was the first in its class to accrue 1 million miles (1.61 million kilometres).\n\nIn early 1963 3801 was given a major overhaul during which it was repainted green. It was often used on special services operated by railway heritage organisations, the most famous being a non-stop run from Sydney to [[Newcastle railway station, New South Wales|Newcastle]] on 28 June 1964. Just failing to break the two-hour barrier, this remained the fastest journey from Sydney to Newcastle by rail (2 hours 1 minute 51 seconds) until bettered by an [[New South Wales XPT|XPT]] in 1988.<ref>\"New Newcastle Speed Record\" ''[[Railway Digest]]'' December 1988 page 437</ref> On the return journey 3801 again fell just short of the two-hour mark. In October 1965 the locomotive was found to have serious [[boiler]] problems, so was withdrawn and placed in the care of the [[NSW Rail Museum|New South Wales Rail Transport Museum]]. The museum contributed $18,000 to return 3801 to service and the boiler from 3819 was fitted. In October 1966 3801 returned to service, however the following year boiler problems re-emerged and the loco was withdrawn. Another boiler exam gave the loco a reprieve and allowed it to return to service. During this time it operated a train celebrating the 25th anniversary of the ''[[Newcastle Flyer]]'' on 31 May 1969, as well as the ''[[Western Endeavour]]'' special across the continent to [[Perth]] between 22 August and 12 September 1970.<ref name=Roundhouse/> In October 1972, 3801 worked to [[South Australia]] with [[3642]] as part of celebrations to open the [[Whyalla railway line|Whyalla line]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bayley|first1=William|title=Steel Wheels on Railway to Whyalla|date=1973|publisher=Austrail Publications|location=Bulli|isbn=0 909597 12 X}}</ref><ref name=Enviro>[http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=4807230 Locomotive, Steam 3801] NSW Environment & Heritage</ref>\n\nFrom April 1974 under the [[Public Transport Commission]] all steam trains were barred from New South Wales main lines, however during June and July of that year 3801 was allowed back to be used as the star of the award-winning film ''[[A Steam Train Passes]]''.\n\n==Preservation==\n[[File:3801 walsh island.jpg|thumb|3801 under restoration at the [[State Dockyard]]]]\n[[File:3801 (NSW steam locomotive) 2.JPG|thumb|3801 at [[Lithgow railway station|Lithgow station]] in January 2006]]\n[[File:3801 Wagga Wagga.jpg|thumb|3801 at [[Wagga Wagga railway station|Wagga Wagga station]] in June 2006 with a recreation of its original ''Grey Nurse'' colour scheme]]\n3801 returned to service on 6 January 1975, operating services on the [[Bankstown railway line|Bankstown line]] to help raise money for survivors of [[Cyclone Tracy]]. After this 3801 was deeded to the Rail Transport Museum.  In June 1975, it hauled [[New South Wales D57 class locomotive|5711]] and [[New South Wales Z19 class locomotive|1905]] to [[Thirlmere railway station|Thirlmere]] when the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum relocated.<ref>\"Museum on the Move\" ''Roundhouse'' June 1976 page 16</ref> The engine was then used on tours until December 1976, when boiler problems led to its withdrawal.\n\nIn November 1982 [[David Hill (businessman)|David Hill]] [[Chief Executive]] of the [[State Rail Authority]] enquired about the suitability of restoring 3801. Hill had the 1988 [[Australian Bicentenary|Bicentenary]] of British settlement in Australia in mind, and saw a restored 3801 as a representative of Australia's railways. The boiler was the major item needing repair and an investigation needed to be carried out to ascertain if restoration was viable. A visit was made to the [[South Maitland Railway]]s (who at the time still used steam engines) to learn about modern boiler techniques. It was discovered that many advances had been made and it was possible to return boilers to service which previously would have been scrapped. The next step was to examine the boilers of the other preserved 38 class members - [[3820]] and [[3830]] (though 3813 had survived, it was completely stripped and in two different locations) - and compare them with 3801's boiler. It was decided to use the boiler already in 3801, however, the inner firebox had suffered thermal fractures and would need extensive repairs. Restoration was deemed possible and a fund-raising appeal began.\n\nWith some finance raised, 3801 was taken to the [[State Dockyard]] in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] on 20 November 1983 for restoration by the Hunter Valley Training Company - an apprenticeship scheme later involved in the restoration of 3830. This was due to the railway's workshops being stretched by regular work. It was marshalled behind [[New South Wales 81 class locomotive|8111]] on an excursion train from [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney]].<ref>\"3801 Welcome back\" ''Railway Digest'' December 1986 pages 363-366</ref>\n\nThe firebox was to be completely replaced, however, the dies and jigs used to press the boiler metal had been scrapped, so the old firebox was used as a template. The new firebox had a different shape and this reduced the boiler pressure from 245 psi to 215 psi. It was decided to weld the new firebox and some conservative engineers were sceptical as to whether this would work. Repairs and reconditioning of many other components were also carried out. The [[Tender locomotive|tender]] tank was so rusted, it needed to be replaced. The new tank was welded rather than riveted and this resulted in a sleek, plain tender. On 8 November 1986, a fire was lit for the first time. By 10 November 3801 was running around nearby sidings. More short trials followed and on 15 November 3801 was handed over and hauled a train to [[Maitland railway station|Maitland]]. More trial runs followed and on 29 November 1986, 3801 headed from Newcastle to a grand ball on the concourse of [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney Central station]].<ref>\"Re-Commissioning 3801 15th November 1986\" ''Railway Digest'' January 1987 page 30</ref>\n\nAfter restoration 3801 operated heritage trains throughout New South Wales. It was operated by [[3801 Limited]] under a 20-year lease. During the [[Australian Bicentenary]] celebrations in 1988, it operated an extensive program across Australia visiting every mainland capital accessible by rail including another trip to Perth in April/May 1988.<ref>\"3801 West\" ''Railway Digest'' July 1988 page 250</ref> In October 1988, [[LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman|''Flying Scotsman'']] arrived from England and for much of its year-long tour across Australia was accompanied by 3801.<ref name=Enviro/>\n\nOn 6 May 1990, 3801 was involved in the [[Cowan rail disaster]]. 3801 was struggling to climb the [[Cowan Bank]] (on the Sydney side of the [[Hawkesbury River]]) when returning from the Morpeth Jazz Festival when a [[CityRail]] [[NSW TrainLink V set|Interurban]] passenger service crashed into the back of 3801's train. Six people lost their lives, including the driver of the intercity electric, and a passenger in the V set's cab. 3801 applied sand to the track to assist grip and an investigation into the crash suggested this may have caused the signals to malfunction. The signals changed from red to green several times. After the signals were green for a few moments, the interurban driver then entered the tunnel behind 3801 where the accident occurred. The handbrake in one of the carriages may also have been applied.<ref>{{cite web|work=Emergency NSW | title=Cowan 1990| url=http://www.emergency.nsw.gov.au/content.php/647.html|accessdate=8 December 2007\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002120830/http://www.emergency.nsw.gov.au/content.php/647.html\n|archivedate=2 October 2013\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=Australian Emergency Management|title=Transport - Brooklyn Train Collision|url=http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=40|accessdate=8 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714180333/http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=40|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992 3801 visited [[Alice Springs railway station|Alice Springs]] for the first time, using the standard gauge track laid in 1980. The locomotive was awarded an Historic Engineering Marker plaque by Engineers Australia on 6 November 1994, the ceremony taking place at [[Robertson railway station|Robertson]]. 3801 was a regular at the [[Hunter Valley Steamfest]].\n\nDespite a campaign by 3801 Limited to retain custodianship of the locomotive, on 26 November 2006 the custodianship passed back to the [[NSW Rail Museum|New South Wales Rail Transport Museum]]. The locomotive continued to haul day trips and longer excursions until withdrawn from service for a major overhaul at the end of 2007.\n\n==2008-2020 overhaul==\nWhen 3801 was withdrawn in 2007, it was decided to replace the original boiler with a new welded one as well as conducting various mechanical repairs.<ref>{{cite web| work=Office of Rail Heritage | title=Office of Rail Heritage \u2013 Projects| url=http://www.nswrailheritage.com.au/orhprojects.htm| accessdate=1 May 2009}}</ref> This was timetabled to be complete by the end of 2010. The contract for the construction of the new boiler was let to [[Meiningen Steam Locomotive Works|Dampflokwerk Meiningen]] in Germany, while the tender tank was transferred to the Hunter Valley Training Company at Maitland for repair.\n\nIn 2010, the new boiler arrived in Australia.  Trial fitting of the boiler revealed a number of dimensional and technical issues which made it unsuitable for use.

His father, Robert Baldwin, Sr., (1926-2008) was a full-time Engineer, and a part-time pianist who worked local clubs throughout [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County, NY]], just north of New York City. While his father was a fan of such jazz icons like Mikes Davis, Bud Powell and Oscar Peterson, his older sister, Deborah, was a fan of soul music of the 1960s, including music by Motown, Stax record labels. These early musical experiences profoundly impacted Baldwin's musical path. He's also a fan of his elder cousin, jazz pianist [[Larry Willis]], who played with Blood, Sweat and Tears, Jerry Gonzalez and the Fort Apache Band.\n\nIn 1987, Sony founded the Sony Innovator's Awards, an annual ceremony to award aspiring Afro-American artists who have shown outstanding talent in music and the visual arts. In his opening speech at the first ceremony held in 1988, music producer [[Quincy Jones]] stated that it was encouraging that a large firm like Sony was providing Afro-American artists a chance to be introduced to the entire nation. Baldwin was awarded the Sony Innovators Award in 1989,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JMwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA29&lpg=PA29&dq=%22sony+innovators+award%22+bob+baldwin&source=bl&ots=Eaq4JB388j&sig=vOLsrBhXJO-hQjDvJz0o6KNttVU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi5_P7S_uLaAhXCm-AKHexbC_MQ6AEIWjAI#v=onepage&q=%22sony+innovators+award%22+bob+baldwin&f=false|title=Ebony|first=Johnson Publishing|last=Company|date=1 November 1989|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|accessdate=19 April 2019|via=Google Books}}</ref> selected by [[Roberta Flack]].<ref name=\"Sony\">{{cite news|title=Sony Innovators|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JMwDAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA29&ots=E7v8ME665i&dq=%22sony%20innovators%20award%22%201989&pg=PA29#v=onepage&q=%22sony%20innovators%20award%22%201989&f=false|page=29|accessdate=24 July 2012|newspaper=Ebony|date=November 1989}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, he met his cousin, Pianist [[Larry Willis]], who's claim to fame began with the pop group Blood, Sweat and Tears. They met later at the funeral of Bob's grandfather, Percy Willis in Norfolk, Va. They played at the elder Willis funeral, and a musical bond was created. Bob and Larry later played at the Savannah Jazz Festival in 2008, both opening for pianist Bob James. They maintained a musical and family bond since 1990.\n\nOut of necessity to maintain creative control, he independently learned how to record music from engineers Wayne Warnecke, Dennis. In 1990, Baldwin worked briefly with producer/arranger/keyboardist [[Kashif (musician)|Kashif]], where he learned about the \u2018wall of sound\u2019 panning technique. In 1989 -1990, he was hired by Kashif to play keyboards and piano on a recording project by a group called The Promise (Arista Records) featuring vocalist [[Joi Cardwell]], but the project was never released.\n\n==Education==\nHe attended [[Geneva College]] in 1978, and graduated in 1986, but to complete his degree, he would have to attend several New York-based Colleges, including [[Hunter College|Hunter]], [[Concordia College (New York)|Concordia]] and [[Iona College (New York)|Iona]], transferring credits back to Geneva between 1980-1986. He majored in Business Administration and minored in Broadcast Communication.\n\nIt was at Geneva College where he discovered Broadcasting radio and hosted his first radio program at college radio station [[WGEV]] from 1979-1980, and after falling short on college funding at Geneva, he returned to New York in 1981, where he completed his college degree, and while in New York, he further developed his broadcasting skills. He later founded the NewUrbanJazz radio program in 2008, which originally aired on WFSK, WNAA, WJAB, WVAS, and WVSU.\n\nBaldwin is listed as a famous Geneva College Alumni, according to Ranker.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ranker.com/list/famous-geneva-college-alumni-and-students/reference|title=Famous Geneva College Alumni|website=Ranker|accessdate=19 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Radio career==\nBetween 1978-1980, Baldwin discovered his love of radio at Geneva College at [[WGEV]], where he minored in Broadcast Communications. It was there he learned radio production, and was a jazz jock on Sunday nights. At Geneva College, he also re-ignited his love for the piano.\n\nBaldwin returned to New York in January, 1981 to utilize and further hone both his music and radio skills. He finished his college career at Concordia, Hunter and Iona Colleges while doing local gigs in the Bronx, Manhattan, and Westchester County.\n\nIn September 1981, Baldwin secured a radio internship at [[Inner City Broadcasting Corporation|Inner City Broadcasting]] ([[WLIB]]/[[WBLS|WBLS) in New York, NY]], then owned by Tuskegee Airman [[Percy Sutton]], where he studied news reporting, and honed other broadcasting skills under the tutelage of then News Director [[KTWV|Pat Prescott]], the late Carl Ferguson<ref>{{cite web|url=http://universityofaltonmaddox.com/site/the-making-of-a-media-monster/|title=The Making of a Media Monster \u00a9 \u2013 University Of Alton Maddox|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2019}}</ref> News Director David Lampel, Larry Hardesty, and Mark Reilly.\n\nIn 1981-1983, he worked briefly at [[WINS (AM)|WINS]], then-owned by Westinghouse Broadcasting, where he pulled news wire for the staff writers.\n\nIn 1984, he was a field news reporter in Westchester County for [[WVIP]] Radio, then located in Mt. Kisco, NY (now located in New Rochelle, NY). He covered the Jesse Jackson Presidential campaign that same year when Jackson came to Shiloh Baptist Church in New Rochelle.\n\nBaldwin reunited with the aforementioned Prescott when she worked for CD101.9 in New York. Prescott introduced Baldwin's music there in the late 1980s. Between 1998 and 2004, he wrote, sang and produced the [[WFAN-FM|CD101.9]] jingle, up to when they changed their smooth jazz format to \"New York Chill\" in 2004.\n\nIn 2004, he was hired by Tame Broadcasting<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rbr.com/former-tama-wjsj-to-be-sold/|title=Former Tama WJSJ to be Sold|first=|last=RBR.com|date=20 November 2015|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2019}}</ref> as the Music Director at [[WJSJ]] (Jacksonville, Fl.), and after that tenure, he helped to launch the first ever smooth jazz station in Bermuda (KJAZ - Trott Communications) from 2005 to 2006.\n\nBaldwin then worked as the Music Director in 2007 at [[WCLK]] (Clark University), then later that fall at [[WJZZ (FM)|WJZZ]], a Radio-One company. Radio-One's WJZZ became Urban AC \u201cMagic 107.5\u201d at 12:00am.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://radioinsight.com/headlines/netgnomes/612/107-5-wjzz-atlanta-to-change-formats/|title=107.5 WJZZ Atlanta To Change Formats|date=28 January 2009|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Baldwin started programming music at both WCLK and WJZZ, which he would later coin the programming sound as \"NewUrbanJazz\". He later founded the NewUrbanJazz Lounge, a weekly syndicated program.\n\n==The NewUrbanJazz radio program==\nIn October 2008, Baldwin fused his musician and radio skills and launched NewUrbanJazz Radio, which programs The NewUrbanJazz Lounge, a 2-hour program that is affiliated on over 40 stations in the U.S. WJAB (Huntsville, Al), WFSK (Nashville, Tn), WNAA (Greensboro, NC), WVAS (Montgomery, Al) and WVSU (Birmingham) were their initial affiliate base. NewUrbanJazz is a fusion of contemporary Jazz, fused with Urban and Brazilian flavors, but also spins music from independent artists. Baldwin's decision to launch NewUrbanJazz Radio Format was based on the sudden closure of [[WFAN-FM|CD101.9]].,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newurbanjazz.com/|title=NewUrbanJazz Lounge - Jazz Music, Radio, Events, Artists, & Musician Page|website=Newurbanjazz.com|accessdate=19 April 2019}}</ref> and his show has expanded to stations in Springfield (WEIB), Atlanta (WCLK), and the U.S. Virgin Islands [https://stjohnsource.com/2019/08/12/wtjx-93-1adds-10-new-shows-to-roster/ (WTJX)], as well as some stations under the [http://www.aaprc.org/ African-American Public Radio Consortium.]\n\n==Early career==\nBetween March and September 1986, Baldwin, along with New York-based guitarist Al Orlo, created the Bob Baldwin/Al Orlo Project, and they performed on Sundays at the Vinnie Pastore-owned Crazy Horse,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/bronx-spotlight-vincent-pastore-article-1.342233|title=Bronx spotlight on Vincent Pastore|author=Bob Kappstater|website=Nydailynews.com|accessdate=19 April 2019}}</ref> a now-defunct small rock and roll club (with a capacity of 50 people) in [[New Rochelle, New York]]. It was a workshop-based project to practice and perform live original material written by Orlo and Baldwin.\n\nBaldwin opened up for the aforementioned trumpeter Browne at The Bottom Line, based in New York City, NY. From that performance, he played alongside Browne in his band, and later collaborated with him on his disc ''No Longer I'', a Gospel-Jazz recording in 1987. Through that production, he met Danny Weiss, the then President for Malaco Jazz. They later co-produced Baldwin's first disc, ''I've Got a Long Way to Go'' together on [[Malaco Records]] in 1988 along with David Wilkes. He began his Contemporary Jazz music career with his first solo album release in 1988 (\"I've Got a Long Way To Go\") on [[Malaco Jazz Records]]. The project was submitted to the Sony Innovators Award<ref name=\"Sony\" /> in 1989 and won first place.

His father, Robert Baldwin, Sr., (1926-2008) was a full-time Engineer, and a part-time pianist who worked local clubs throughout [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County, NY]], just north of New York City. While his father was a fan of such jazz icons like Mikes Davis, Bud Powell and Oscar Peterson, his older sister, Deborah, was a fan of soul music of the 1960s, including music by Motown, Stax record labels. These early musical experiences profoundly impacted Baldwin's musical path. He's also a fan of his elder cousin, jazz pianist [[Larry Willis]], who played with Blood, Sweat and Tears, Jerry Gonzalez and the Fort Apache Band.\n\nIn 1987, Sony founded the Sony Innovator's Awards, an annual ceremony to award aspiring Afro-American artists who have shown outstanding talent in music and the visual arts. In his opening speech at the first ceremony held in 1988, music producer [[Quincy Jones]] stated that it was encouraging that a large firm like Sony was providing Afro-American artists a chance to be introduced to the entire nation. Baldwin was awarded the Sony Innovators Award in 1989,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JMwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA29&lpg=PA29&dq=%22sony+innovators+award%22+bob+baldwin&source=bl&ots=Eaq4JB388j&sig=vOLsrBhXJO-hQjDvJz0o6KNttVU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi5_P7S_uLaAhXCm-AKHexbC_MQ6AEIWjAI#v=onepage&q=%22sony+innovators+award%22+bob+baldwin&f=false|title=Ebony|first=Johnson Publishing|last=Company|date=1 November 1989|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|accessdate=19 April 2019|via=Google Books}}</ref> selected by [[Roberta Flack]].<ref name=\"Sony\">{{cite news|title=Sony Innovators|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JMwDAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA29&ots=E7v8ME665i&dq=%22sony%20innovators%20award%22%201989&pg=PA29#v=onepage&q=%22sony%20innovators%20award%22%201989&f=false|page=29|accessdate=24 July 2012|newspaper=Ebony|date=November 1989}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, he met his cousin, Pianist [[Larry Willis]], who's claim to fame began with the pop group Blood, Sweat and Tears. They met later at the funeral of Bob's grandfather, Percy Willis in Norfolk, Va. They played at the elder Willis funeral, and a musical bond was created. Bob and Larry later played at the Savannah Jazz Festival in 2008, both opening for pianist Bob James. They maintained a musical and family bond since 1990.\n\nOut of necessity to maintain creative control, he independently learned how to record music from engineers Wayne Warnecke, Dennis. In 1990, Baldwin worked briefly with producer/arranger/keyboardist [[Kashif (musician)|Kashif]], where he learned about the \u2018wall of sound\u2019 panning technique. In 1989 -1990, he was hired by Kashif to play keyboards and piano on a recording project by a group called The Promise (Arista Records) featuring vocalist [[Joi Cardwell]], but the project was never released.\n\n==Education==\nHe attended [[Geneva College]] in 1978, and graduated in 1986, but to complete his degree, he would have to attend several New York-based Colleges, including [[Hunter College|Hunter]], [[Concordia College (New York)|Concordia]] and [[Iona College (New York)|Iona]], transferring credits back to Geneva between 1980-1986. He majored in Business Administration and minored in Broadcast Communication.\n\nIt was at Geneva College where he discovered Broadcasting radio and hosted his first radio program at college radio station [[WGEV]] from 1979-1980, and after falling short on college funding at Geneva, he returned to New York in 1981, where he completed his college degree, and while in New York, he further developed his broadcasting skills. He later founded the NewUrbanJazz radio program in 2008, which originally aired on WFSK, WNAA, WJAB, WVAS, and WVSU.\n\nBaldwin is listed as a famous Geneva College Alumni, according to Ranker.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ranker.com/list/famous-geneva-college-alumni-and-students/reference|title=Famous Geneva College Alumni|website=Ranker|accessdate=19 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Radio career==\nBetween 1978-1980, Baldwin discovered his love of radio at Geneva College at [[WGEV]], where he minored in Broadcast Communications. It was there he learned radio production, and was a jazz jock on Sunday nights. At Geneva College, he also re-ignited his love for the piano.\n\nBaldwin returned to New York in January, 1981 to utilize and further hone both his music and radio skills. He finished his college career at Concordia, Hunter and Iona Colleges while doing local gigs in the Bronx, Manhattan, and Westchester County.\n\nIn September 1981, Baldwin secured a radio internship at [[Inner City Broadcasting Corporation|Inner City Broadcasting]] ([[WLIB]]/[[WBLS|WBLS) in New York, NY]], then owned by Tuskegee Airman [[Percy Sutton]], where he studied news reporting, and honed other broadcasting skills under the tutelage of then News Director [[KTWV|Pat Prescott]], the late Carl Ferguson<ref>{{cite web|url=http://universityofaltonmaddox.com/site/the-making-of-a-media-monster/|title=The Making of a Media Monster \u00a9 \u2013 University Of Alton Maddox|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2019}}</ref> News Director David Lampel, Larry Hardesty, and Mark Reilly.\n\nIn 1981-1983, he worked briefly at [[WINS (AM)|WINS]], then-owned by Westinghouse Broadcasting, where he pulled news wire for the staff writers.\n\nIn 1984, he was a field news reporter in Westchester County for [[WVIP]] Radio, then located in Mt. Kisco, NY (now located in New Rochelle, NY). He covered the Jesse Jackson Presidential campaign that same year when Jackson came to Shiloh Baptist Church in New Rochelle.\n\nBaldwin reunited with the aforementioned Prescott when she worked for CD101.9 in New York. Prescott introduced Baldwin's music there in the late 1980s. Between 1998 and 2004, he wrote, sang and produced the [[WFAN-FM|CD101.9]] jingle, up to when they changed their smooth jazz format to \"New York Chill\" in 2004.\n\nIn 2004, he was hired by Tame Broadcasting<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rbr.com/former-tama-wjsj-to-be-sold/|title=Former Tama WJSJ to be Sold|first=|last=RBR.com|date=20 November 2015|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2019}}</ref> as the Music Director at [[WJSJ]] (Jacksonville, Fl.), and after that tenure, he helped to launch the first ever smooth jazz station in Bermuda (KJAZ - Trott Communications) from 2005 to 2006.\n\nBaldwin then worked as the Music Director in 2007 at [[WCLK]] (Clark University), then later that fall at [[WJZZ (FM)|WJZZ]], a Radio-One company.

He later founded the NewUrbanJazz Lounge, a weekly syndicated program.\n\n==The NewUrbanJazz radio program==\nIn October, 2008, Baldwin fused his musician and radio skills and launched NewUrbanJazz Radio, which programs The NewUrbanJazz Lounge, a 2-hour program that is affiliated on over 40 stations in the U.S. WJAB (Huntsville, Al), WFSK (Nashville, Tn), WNAA (Greensboro, NC), WVAS (Montgomery, Al) and WVSU (Birmingham) were their initial affiliate base. NewUrbanJazz is a fusion of contemporary Jazz, fused with Urban and Brazilian flavors, but also spins music from independent artists. Baldwin's decision to launch NewUrbanJazz Radio Format was based on the sudden closure of [[WFAN-FM|CD101.9]].,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newurbanjazz.com/|title=NewUrbanJazz Lounge - Jazz Music, Radio, Events, Artists, & Musician Page|website=Newurbanjazz.com|accessdate=19 April 2019}}</ref> and his show has expanded to stations in Springfield (WEIB), Atlanta (WCLK), and the U.S. Virgin Islands [https://stjohnsource.com/2019/08/12/wtjx-93-1adds-10-new-shows-to-roster/ (WTJX)], as well as some stations under the [http://www.aaprc.org/ African-American Publc Radio Consortium.]\n\n==Early career==\nBetween March and September 1986, Baldwin, along with New York-based guitarist Al Orlo, created the Bob Baldwin/Al Orlo Project, and they performed on Sundays at the Vinnie Pastore-owned Crazy Horse,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/bronx-spotlight-vincent-pastore-article-1.342233|title=Bronx spotlight on Vincent Pastore|author=Bob Kappstater|website=Nydailynews.com|accessdate=19 April 2019}}</ref> a now-defunct small rock and roll club (with a capacity of 50 people) in [[New Rochelle, New York]]. It was a workshop-based project to practice and perform live original material written by Orlo and Baldwin.\n\nBaldwin opened up for the aforementioned trumpeter Browne at The Bottom Line, based in New York City, NY. From that performance, he played alongside Browne in his band, and later collaborated with him on his disc ''No Longer I'', a Gospel-Jazz recording in 1987. Through that production, he met Danny Weiss, the then President for Malaco Jazz. They later co-produced Baldwin's first disc, ''I've Got a Long Way to Go'' together on [[Malaco Records]] in 1988 along with David Wilkes. He began his Contemporary Jazz music career with his first solo album release in 1988 (\"I've Got a Long Way To Go\") on [[Malaco Jazz Records]].The project was submitted to the Sony Innovators Award<ref name=\"Sony\" /> in 1989 and won first place.

They compete in the annual [[Six Nations Championship]] with [[France national rugby union team|France]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]]. England have won the championship on a total of 28 occasions (as well as sharing 10 victories) \u2013 winning the [[Grand Slam (rugby union)|Grand Slam]] 13 times and the [[Triple Crown (rugby union)|Triple Crown]] 26 times \u2013 making them the most successful outright winners in the tournament's history. {{As of|2019|11|18}}, England are [[IRB World Rankings|ranked]] third in the world by the [[International Rugby Board]]. They are currently the only team from the [[Northern Hemisphere]] to win the [[Rugby World Cup]], having won the tournament in [[2003 Rugby World Cup|2003]], and have been runners-up on three other occasions.<!--DETAILED BELOW-->\n\nThe history of the team extends back to 1871 when the English rugby team played [[1871 Scotland versus England rugby union match|their first official]] [[Test match (rugby union)|test match]], losing 1\u20130 to Scotland. England dominated the early Home Nations Championship (now the [[Six Nations Championship|Six Nations]]) which started in 1883. Following the [[History of rugby league#The schism in England|schism]] of rugby football in 1895 into union and league, England did not win the Championship again until 1910. They first played against [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] in 1905, [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] in 1906, and [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] in 1909. England was one of the teams invited to take part in the inaugural Rugby World Cup in [[1987 Rugby World Cup|1987]] and progressed to the final in the second tournament in [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]], losing 12\u20136 to Australia. Following their Grand Slam in [[2003 Six Nations Championship|2003]], England went on to win the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]], defeating Australia 20\u201317 in extra time. They contested the final again in [[2007 Rugby World Cup|2007]] in defence of their title, losing 15\u20136 to South Africa, and reached the final for the fourth time in [[2019 Rugby World Cup|2019]], once again losing to South Africa, 32\u201312.\n\nEngland players traditionally wear a white shirt with a rose embroidered on the chest, white shorts, and navy blue socks with a white trim. England's home ground is [[Twickenham Stadium]] where they first played in 1910. The team is administered by the [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU). Four former players have been inducted into the [[International Rugby Hall of Fame]]; one of these is also a member of the [[IRB Hall of Fame]]. Seven other former players are members of the IRB Hall \u2013 four solely for their accomplishments as players, two solely for their achievements in other roles in the sport, and one for achievements both as a player and administrator.\n\n==History==\n{{main article|History of the England national rugby union team}}\n<!--This is only a SUMMARY of the history of the England team.

England's first international at Twickenham in 1910 brought them victory over Wales on their way to winning the [[Six Nations Championship|International Championship]] (known from then as the Five Nations) for the first time since [[1892 Home Nations Championship|1892]].

The land for the ground was purchased in 1907 for [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]5,572 12[[Shilling|s]] and 6[[Old penny sterling|d]], and construction began the following year.<ref name=\"Twickenhamhist\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rfu.com/TwickenhamStadium/WorldRugbyMuseum/RugbyHistory/StadiumChronology.aspx |title=Twickenham Stadium Time Line |publisher=[[Rugby Football Union]] |website=rfu.com |accessdate=16 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115050016/http://www.rfu.com/TwickenhamStadium/WorldRugbyMuseum/RugbyHistory/StadiumChronology.aspx |archivedate=15 January 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe first international match at Twickenham took place on 15 January 1910 between England and Wales.

England have won the title outright 28 times (a record for the tournament) and shared victory ten times. Their longest wait between championships was 18 years (1892\u20131910). During the Six Nations, England also contests the [[Calcutta Cup]] with Scotland (which England first won in 1880) and the [[Millennium Trophy]] with Ireland (which England first won in 1988).

They again finished pool runners-up in [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]] but recovered to beat France in the quarter-finals, and then Scotland in the semi-finals, en route to a 12\u20136 final defeat to Australia at Twickenham on 2 November 1991.\n\nIn [[1995 Rugby World Cup|1995]], England topped their pool and defeated Australia 25\u201322 at the quarter-final stage before being beaten by the All Blacks in the semi-final. Their [[1995 Rugby World Cup#Third-place play-off|third-place play-off]] match against France was lost 19\u20139.\n\nIn the [[1999 Rugby World Cup|1999 tournament]], England again finished second in their pool. Although they proceeded to win a play-off game against Fiji, they went out of the tournament in the quarter-finals, losing 44\u201321 to South Africa.\n\nEngland came top of their pool in [[2003 Rugby World Cup|2003]] and progressed to the final, beating Wales and France in the quarter- and semi-finals. With a drop goal in the last minute of extra time, England won the final 20\u201317 against Australia in Sydney on 22 November 2003.\n\nEngland made a poor start to their defence of the World Cup in [[2007 Rugby World Cup|2007]], with a below par victory over the United States and a heavy 36\u20130 defeat to South Africa, leaving the title holders on the brink of elimination at the pool stage. Improved performances against Samoa and Tonga ensured that England again reached the knockout stage as pool runners-up, before a surprise 12\u201310 defeat of Australia in the quarter-finals followed by a narrow 14\u20139 victory over the host nation carried England to a second successive final appearance. In the final, held in Paris on 20 October, England lost 15\u20136 to South Africa, their second defeat by the Springboks during the 2007 tournament.\n\nEngland reached the quarter-final stage in [[2011 Rugby World Cup|2011]], losing 19\u201312 to France.\n\nIn [[2015 Rugby World Cup|2015]], England became the first sole host nation to fail to qualify for the knockout stage, after losing to Wales and Australia in the pool stage.\n\nIn [[2019 Rugby World Cup|2019]], England finished top of their pool before defeating Australia and New Zealand in the knockout stage. On 2 November 2019, they suffered a 32\u201312 final defeat to South Africa in Yokohama, becoming World Cup runners-up for the third time.\n\nEngland's [[Jonny Wilkinson]] is the highest points scorer in the Rugby World Cup, having scored 277 points between 1999 and 2011.

They again dropped to 2nd in the rankings, and then to 3rd, from mid-June 2004. Following the [[2005 Six Nations Championship]], they fell to 6th in the world rankings, where they remained until moving up to 5th place in December of that year. After a decline in form in 2006, England finished the year ranked 7th; however, they bounced back to 3rd in 2007 due to their good run in that year's [[2007 Rugby World Cup|World Cup]], where they finished runners-up. \n\nTheir ranking slipped again in 2008 and during the [[2009 Six Nations Championship]] they dropped to their lowest ranking of 8th, where they remained for the duration of the [[2009 end of year rugby tests|2009 Autumn internationals]]. After a brief resurgence that saw them rise to a ranking of 4th in the world, England again slipped following a poor showing at the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]] and were ranked 6th in February 2012. The team entered the [[2015 Rugby World Cup]] ranked 4th, but after failing to progress beyond the pool stage, England again sank to 8th in the world in November 2015. In March 2016, after securing the Grand Slam in the [[2016 Six Nations Championship]], England rose to second place, where they remained the following year after winning the [[2017 Six Nations Championship]]. A poor fifth-place performance in the [[2018 Six Nations Championship]] saw them fall to sixth place. \n\nIn October 2019, England defeated New Zealand in the semi-final of the [[2019 Rugby World Cup]] to top the World Rugby Rankings for the first time since 2004<ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-union/international/rugby-world-cup-2019-rankings-england-top-15-years-final-vs-south-africa-new-zealand-all-blacks-a9174251.html</ref>.

Playing as [[Flanker (rugby union)|flanker]], Wakefield introduced new elements to back row tactics which beforehand concentrated on the set piece. He became a [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] in 1935, and was knighted in 1944.

He was best known as a superlative leader, motivating England to a remarkable three Grand Slams in five years, including back to back slams in 1991 and 1992. He also led England to the final of the 1991 World Cup, and captained the [[Barbarian F.C.|Barbarians FC]]. His playing talents were not as flamboyant as some of his colleagues, but his effectiveness cemented him as a first choice at [[Centre (rugby union)|centre]]. It is possible he would already be in the Hall of Fame were it not for outspoken tendencies with respect to the English RFU committee (\"Old Farts\"), who may, as a result, be reluctant to acknowledge his achievements. He was made an [[OBE]] in 1991.

The IRB recognised them for \"their unique contribution to the way that Rugby was played\", specifically stating that they \"are credited with pioneering the passing game and the three-man backline, which became widespread during the 1880s\".<ref name=\"Rotherham-Vassall\"/>\n\nTwo other England internationals, [[John Kendall-Carpenter]] and [[Clive Woodward]], were inducted into the IRB Hall alongside Johnson at the 2011 IRB Awards.

They compete in the annual [[Six Nations Championship]] with [[France national rugby union team|France]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]]. England have won the championship on a total of 28 occasions (as well as sharing 10 victories) \u2013 winning the [[Grand Slam (rugby union)|Grand Slam]] 13 times and the [[Triple Crown (rugby union)|Triple Crown]] 26 times \u2013 making them the most successful outright winners in the tournament's history. {{As of|2019|11|18}}, England are [[IRB World Rankings|ranked]] third in the world by the [[International Rugby Board]]. They are currently the only team from the [[Northern Hemisphere]] to win the [[Rugby World Cup]], having won the tournament in [[2003 Rugby World Cup|2003]], and have been runners-up on three other occasions.<!--DETAILED BELOW-->\n\nThe history of the team extends back to 1871 when the English rugby team played [[1871 Scotland versus England rugby union match|their first official]] [[Test match (rugby union)|test match]], losing 1\u20130 to Scotland. England dominated the early Home Nations Championship (now the [[Six Nations Championship|Six Nations]]) which started in 1883. Following the [[History of rugby league#The schism in England|schism]] of rugby football in 1895 into union and league, England did not win the Championship again until 1910. They first played against [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] in 1905, [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] in 1906, and [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] in 1909. England was one of the teams invited to take part in the inaugural Rugby World Cup in [[1987 Rugby World Cup|1987]] and progressed to the final in the second tournament in [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]], losing 12\u20136 to Australia. Following their Grand Slam in [[2003 Six Nations Championship|2003]], England went on to win the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]], defeating Australia 20\u201317 in extra time. They contested the final again in [[2007 Rugby World Cup|2007]] in defence of their title, losing 15\u20136 to South Africa, and reached the final for the fourth time in [[2019 Rugby World Cup|2019]], once again losing to South Africa, 32\u201312.\n\nEngland players traditionally wear a white shirt with a rose embroidered on the chest, white shorts, and navy blue socks with a white trim. England's home ground is [[Twickenham Stadium]] where they first played in 1910. The team is administered by the [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU). Four former players have been inducted into the [[International Rugby Hall of Fame]]; one of these is also a member of the [[IRB Hall of Fame]]. Seven other former players are members of the IRB Hall \u2013 four solely for their accomplishments as players, two solely for their achievements in other roles in the sport, and one for achievements both as a player and administrator.\n\n==History==\n{{main article|History of the England national rugby union team}}\n<!--This is only a SUMMARY of the history of the England team.

England's first international at Twickenham in 1910 brought them victory over Wales on their way to winning the [[Six Nations Championship|International Championship]] (known from then as the Five Nations) for the first time since [[1892 Home Nations Championship|1892]].

The land for the ground was purchased in 1907 for [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]5,572 12[[Shilling|s]] and 6[[Old penny sterling|d]], and construction began the following year.<ref name=\"Twickenhamhist\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rfu.com/TwickenhamStadium/WorldRugbyMuseum/RugbyHistory/StadiumChronology.aspx |title=Twickenham Stadium Time Line |publisher=[[Rugby Football Union]] |website=rfu.com |accessdate=16 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115050016/http://www.rfu.com/TwickenhamStadium/WorldRugbyMuseum/RugbyHistory/StadiumChronology.aspx |archivedate=15 January 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe first international match at Twickenham took place on 15 January 1910 between England and Wales.

England have won the title outright 28 times (a record for the tournament) and shared victory ten times. Their longest wait between championships was 18 years (1892\u20131910). During the Six Nations, England also contests the [[Calcutta Cup]] with Scotland (which England first won in 1880) and the [[Millennium Trophy]] with Ireland (which England first won in 1988).

They again finished pool runners-up in [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]] but recovered to beat France in the quarter-finals, and then Scotland in the semi-finals, en route to a 12\u20136 final defeat to Australia at Twickenham on 2 November 1991.\n\nIn [[1995 Rugby World Cup|1995]], England topped their pool and defeated Australia 25\u201322 at the quarter-final stage before being beaten by the All Blacks in the semi-final. Their [[1995 Rugby World Cup#Third-place play-off|third-place play-off]] match against France was lost 19\u20139.\n\nIn the [[1999 Rugby World Cup|1999 tournament]], England again finished second in their pool. Although they proceeded to win a play-off game against Fiji, they went out of the tournament in the quarter-finals, losing 44\u201321 to South Africa.\n\nEngland came top of their pool in [[2003 Rugby World Cup|2003]] and progressed to the final, beating Wales and France in the quarter- and semi-finals. With a drop goal in the last minute of extra time, England won the final 20\u201317 against Australia in Sydney on 22 November 2003.\n\nEngland made a poor start to their defence of the World Cup in [[2007 Rugby World Cup|2007]], with a below par victory over the United States and a heavy 36\u20130 defeat to South Africa, leaving the title holders on the brink of elimination at the pool stage. Improved performances against Samoa and Tonga ensured that England again reached the knockout stage as pool runners-up, before a surprise 12\u201310 defeat of Australia in the quarter-finals followed by a narrow 14\u20139 victory over the host nation carried England to a second successive final appearance. In the final, held in Paris on 20 October, England lost 15\u20136 to South Africa, their second defeat by the Springboks during the 2007 tournament.\n\nEngland reached the quarter-final stage in [[2011 Rugby World Cup|2011]], losing 19\u201312 to France.\n\nIn [[2015 Rugby World Cup|2015]], England became the first sole host nation to fail to qualify for the knockout stage, after losing to Wales and Australia in the pool stage.\n\nIn [[2019 Rugby World Cup|2019]], England finished top of their pool before defeating Australia and New Zealand in the knockout stage. On 2 November 2019, they suffered a 32\u201312 final defeat to South Africa in Yokohama, becoming World Cup runners-up for the third time.\n\nEngland's [[Jonny Wilkinson]] is the highest points scorer in the Rugby World Cup, having scored 277 points between 1999 and 2011.

They again dropped to 2nd in the rankings, and then to 3rd, from mid-June 2004. Following the [[2005 Six Nations Championship]], they fell to 6th in the world rankings, where they remained until moving up to 5th place in December of that year. After a decline in form in 2006, England finished the year ranked 7th; however, they bounced back to 3rd in 2007 due to their good run in that year's [[2007 Rugby World Cup|World Cup]], where they finished runners-up. \n\nTheir ranking slipped again in 2008 and during the [[2009 Six Nations Championship]] they dropped to their lowest ranking of 8th, where they remained for the duration of the [[2009 end of year rugby tests|2009 Autumn internationals]]. After a brief resurgence that saw them rise to a ranking of 4th in the world, England again slipped following a poor showing at the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]] and were ranked 6th in February 2012. The team entered the [[2015 Rugby World Cup]] ranked 4th, but after failing to progress beyond the pool stage, England again sank to 8th in the world in November 2015. In March 2016, after securing the Grand Slam in the [[2016 Six Nations Championship]], England rose to second place, where they remained the following year after winning the [[2017 Six Nations Championship]]. A poor fifth-place performance in the [[2018 Six Nations Championship]] saw them fall to sixth place. \n\nIn October 2019, England defeated New Zealand in the semi-final of the [[2019 Rugby World Cup]] to top the World Rugby Rankings for the first time since 2004<ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-union/international/rugby-world-cup-2019-rankings-england-top-15-years-final-vs-south-africa-new-zealand-all-blacks-a9174251.html</ref>.

Playing as [[Flanker (rugby union)|flanker]], Wakefield introduced new elements to back row tactics which beforehand concentrated on the set piece. He became a [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] in 1935, and was knighted in 1944.

He was best known as a superlative leader, motivating England to a remarkable three Grand Slams in five years, including back to back slams in 1991 and 1992. He also led England to the final of the 1991 World Cup, and captained the [[Barbarian F.C.|Barbarians FC]]. His playing talents were not as flamboyant as some of his colleagues, but his effectiveness cemented him as a first choice at [[Centre (rugby union)|centre]]. It is possible he would already be in the Hall of Fame were it not for outspoken tendencies with respect to the English RFU committee (\"Old Farts\"), who may, as a result, be reluctant to acknowledge his achievements. He was made an [[OBE]] in 1991.

The IRB recognised them for \"their unique contribution to the way that Rugby was played\", specifically stating that they \"are credited with pioneering the passing game and the three-man backline, which became widespread during the 1880s\".<ref name=\"Rotherham-Vassall\"/>\n\nTwo other England internationals, [[John Kendall-Carpenter]] and [[Clive Woodward]], were inducted into the IRB Hall alongside Johnson at the 2011 IRB Awards.

During the 1907 conversion, the hotel was extended by two storeys, preserving the architectural style of the original building.<ref name=\":5\" /> Instead of the formerly continuous loggia, all the rooms behind the main fa\u00e7ade were fitted with verandas and the pillars on the ground floor were narrowed down. The new floors were joined together by pillars with plant capitals that spanned several storeys. The top floor is distinguished by a meandering stone railing and pharaoh figures supporting the beams.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nIn the 1970s, the building had to be completely demolished in accordance with fire protection guidelines, but also for reasons of comfort; conversion was not possible. At the same time, however, the street scene, consisting of the Tiefenhofh\u00e4usern, the Kreditanstalt and the Hotel Savoy Baur en Ville on Paradeplatz, was to be retained. The contract for the construction was awarded to Karl Steiner AG,<ref name=\":4\" /> which removed the fa\u00e7ade step by step, erected a new building and then rebuilt the historic fa\u00e7ade.

During the 1907 conversion, the hotel was extended by two storeys, preserving the architectural style of the original building.<ref name=\":5\" /> Instead of the formerly continuous loggia, all the rooms behind the main fa\u00e7ade were fitted with verandas and the pillars on the ground floor were narrowed down.

At the same time, however, the street scene, consisting of the Tiefenhofh\u00e4usern, the Kreditanstalt and the Hotel Savoy Baur en Ville on Paradeplatz, was to be retained. The contract for the construction was awarded to Karl Steiner AG,<ref name=\":4\" /> which removed the fa\u00e7ade step by step, erected a new building and then rebuilt the historic fa\u00e7ade.

Water skiing typically begins with a deep-water start. The skier enters the water with their skis on or they jump in without the skis on their feet, have the skis floated to them, and put them on while in the water. Most times it can be easier to put the skis on when they are wet. Once the skier has their skis on they will be thrown a tow rope from the boat, which they position between their skis. In the deep-water start, the skier crouches down in the water while holding onto the ski rope; they are in a cannonball position with their legs tucked into their chest, with skis pointing towards the sky and approximately {{convert|30|cm|ft|abbr=on}} of the ski out of the water. The skier can also perform a \"dry start\" by standing on the shore or a pier; however, this type of entry is recommended for professionals only. When the skier is ready (usually acknowledged by them yelling \"hit it\"), the driver accelerates the boat. As the boat accelerates and takes up the slack on the rope, the skier allows the boat to pull them out of the water by applying some [[muscle strength]] to get them! into an upright body position.\n\nBy leaning back and keeping the legs slightly bent, the skis will eventually plane out and the skier will start to glide over the water. The skier turns by shifting weight left or right. The skier's body weight should be balanced between the balls of the feet and the heels. While being towed, the skier's arms should be relaxed but still fully extended so as to reduce stress on the arms. The handle can be held vertically or horizontally, depending on whichever position is more comfortable for the skier.\n\nIn addition to the driver and the skier, a third person known as the ''spotter'' or the ''observer'' should be present. The spotter's job is to watch the skier and inform the driver if the skier falls. The spotter usually sits in a chair on the boat facing backwards to see the skier. The skier and the boat's occupants communicate using hand signals (see the [[#Safety measures|Safety]] section below).\n\n==Equipment==\n\n===Water===\n[[File:Chantalyy Lakes By The Cliff Side.jpg|thumb|A privately owned, man-made water ski lake commonly referred to as Chantalyy Lakes By The Cliff Side, located near Orangeville, Ontario seen with a slalom course and jump ramp]]\nWater skiing can take place on any type of water \u2013 such as a river, lake, or ocean \u2013 but calmer waters are ideal for recreational skiing.  There should be a {{convert|200|ft|m|sigfig=1|order=flip|adj=mid|-wide}} skiing space and the water should be at least {{convert|5|to|6|ft|m|1|order=flip}} deep. There must be enough space for the water skier to safely \"get up\", or successfully be in the upright skiing position. Skiers and their boat drivers must also have sufficient room to avoid hazards.\n\n===Skis===\n[[File:Datteln - KF2011 - Ostufer 06 ies.jpg|thumb|Several types of water skis and [[wetsuit]]s]]\nYounger skiers generally start out on children's skis, which consist of two skis tied together at their back and front.

Generally the heavier the person, the bigger the skis will be.

A trick ski is around 40 inches long and wider than combo skis. Again the skier rides it with his or her dominant foot in front. It has no fins which allows for spins to be performed.\n\n===Boat===\n{{hatnote|This section describes water skiing behind a boat. For information about skiing with a cable installation, see the related Wikipedia article on [[cable skiing]].}}\n\nCompetition skiing uses specifically designed towboats. Most towboats have a very small hull and a flat bottom to minimize wake. A true tournament ski boat will have a direct drive motor shaft that centers the weight in the boat for an optimal wake shape. However, some recreational ski boats will have the motor placed in the back of the boat ([[v-drive]]), which creates a bigger wake. Permitted towboats used for tournament water skiing are the Mastercraft ProStar 197, MasterCraft ProStar 190, Nautique 200, Malibu Response TXi, and Centurion Carbon Pro.<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.usawaterski.org/pages/TournKit/AWSA/Chief%20Driver/ApprovedTournamentTowboats.pdf | format = PDF | title = American Water Ski Association Approved Tournament Towboats, 2013 | date = 15 January 2013 | publisher = American Water Ski Association | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120916234342/http://www.usawaterski.org/pages/TournKit/AWSA/Chief%20Driver/ApprovedTournamentTowboats.pdf | archivedate = 16 September 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> These boats have ability to pull skiers for trick skiing, jumping, and slalom.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.waterskimag.com/features/2013/03/04/best-of-boats-top-tournament-ski-boats/ | title = Best of Boats: Top Tournament Ski Boats 2013 | author = Geena | date = 7 May 2013 | publisher = Waterski Magazine | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130908021150/http://www.waterskimag.com/features/2013/03/04/best-of-boats-top-tournament-ski-boats/ | archivedate = 8 September 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nRecreational boats can serve as water skiing platforms as well as other purposes such as cruising and fishing.

Samuelson experimented with different positions on the skis for several days until 2 July 1922. Samuelson discovered that leaning backwards in the water with ski tips up and poking out of the water at the tip was the optimal method. His brother Ben towed him and they reached a speed of {{convert|20|mph|km/h|order=flip}}.<ref name=ABC-history/> Samuelson spent 15 years performing shows and teaching water skiing to people in the United States.\n\nSamuelson went through several iterations of equipment in his quest to ski on water. His first equipment consisted of barrel staves for skis.<ref name=ABC-history>{{cite web|title=History of Water Skiing|url=http://www.abc-of-skiing.com/water-skiing/history.asp|work=ABC of Skiing|publisher=MaxLifestyle International Inc.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421022737/http://www.abc-of-skiing.com/water-skiing/history.asp|archivedate=21 April 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He later tried [[Ski|snow skis]],<ref name=ABC-history/> but finally fabricated his own design out of lumber with bindings made of strips of leather. The ski rope was made from a long [[Sash window|window sash]] cord.<ref name=ABC-history/> Samuelson never patented any of his ski equipment.\n\nThe first patent for water skis was issued to [[Fred Waller]], of Huntington, NY, on 27 October 1925, for skis he developed independently and marketed as \"Dolphin Akwa-Skees.\" Waller's skis were constructed of kiln-dried mahogany, as were some boats at that time. Jack Andresen patented the first trick ski, a shorter, fin-less water ski, in 1940.\n\nIn 1928 [http://www.usawaterskifoundation.org/#!don-ibsen/czd0 Don Ibsen] developed his own water skis on the West Coast, never having heard of Samuelson or Waller. In 1941 Don Ibsen founded The Olympic Water Ski Club in Seattle, WA. It was the first such club in America. Ibsen, a showman and entrepreneur, was one of the earliest manufacturers of water skis and was a leading enthusiast and promoter of the sport. In 1983 he was inducted into the Water Ski Hall of Fame in Winterhaven, FL.\n\nThe sport of water skiing remained an obscure activity for several years after 1922, until Samuelson performed water ski shows from Michigan to Florida. The American Water Ski Association formally acknowledged Samuelson in 1966 as the first recorded water skier in history. Samuelson was also the first ski racer, slalom skier, and the first organizer of a water ski show.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ralph W.

Pope cultivated a distinct image for his theme-park, which included countless photographs of the water skiers featured at the park. These photographs began appearing in magazines worldwide in the 1940s and 1950s, helping to bring international attention to the sport for the first time.<ref>The Lakeland Ledger, 29 January 1988.

Both men are in the [[Water Ski Hall of Fame and Museum|Water Ski Hall of Fame]]. Today, Winter Haven, Florida, with its famous [[Chain of Lakes (Winter Haven)|Chain of Lakes]], remains an important city for water skiing, with several major ski schools operating there.\n\nWater skiing has developed over time. Water skiing tournaments and water skiing competitions have been organized. As an exhibition sport, water skiing was included in the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympics]]. The first National Show Ski Tournament was held in 1974, and the first ever National Intercollegiate Water Ski Championships were held in 1979. The Home CARE US National Water Ski Challenge, the first competition for people with disabilities, was organized ten years later.\n\nThe first patented design of a water ski which included carbon fiber was that of Hani Audah at SPORT labs in 2001.

Slalom skis are narrow and long, at {{convert|57|-|70|in|cm|0}} depending on the height and weight of the skier. The two forward-facing bindings vary: they can be made of rubber or thick plastic, and they can be designed more like a [[Ski binding|snow ski binding]] or more like a [[Inline skates|roller blade boot]].\n\nSlalom skiing involves a multi-buoy course that the skier must go around in order to complete the pass. A complete slalom water ski course consists of 26 buoys. There are entrance gates at the beginning and end of the course that the skier must go between, and there are 6 turn buoys that the skier must navigate around in a zigzag pattern. The remainder of the buoys are for the driver to ensure the boat goes straight down the center of the course. For a tournament to be sanctioned as 'record capable' by the [[International Waterski & Wakeboard Federation]] (IWWF), the entire course must be surveyed prior to competition by a land surveyor to ensure its accuracy. The drivers boat path must be verified as well to ensure that all skiers are getting a fair pull.\n\nEvery consecutive<ref name=iwsf-history/> pass is harder than the pass before it. When a pass is completed, the boat is sped up by {{convert|3|km/h|mph|0}} until the maximum speed has been reached for the division, based on the skier's gender and age ({{convert|55|km/h|mph|0}} for women and {{convert|58|km/h|mph|0}} for men). After the skier has run their maximum speed pass, the rope is shortened at specific increments to make it more difficult to reach the buoy width. In a tournament, the boat speeds up or the rope shortens until the skier fails to complete the slalom course by falling or not getting around a buoy.<ref name=iwsf-history/>\n\nA skier's score is based upon the number of successful buoys cleared, the speed of the boat, and the length of the rope. In a tournament, skiers choose the starting boat speed and rope length (with a maximum length of {{convert|22.86|m|ft|0}}). Professional water skiers will typically start at the max speed of {{convert|58|km/h|mph|0}} with a rope that has already been shortened to {{convert|13|m|ft}}. The skier with the most buoys wins the competition.<ref name=iwsf-history/>\n\nThe turn buoys are positioned {{convert|11.5|m|ft}} away from the center of the slalom course. As the rope is shortened beyond that, the skiers are required to use the momentum generated through their turns to swing up on the side of the boat and reach out in order to get their ski around the next buoy. At these rope lengths, the skier's body is experiencing intense isometric contractions and extreme upper body torque with loads of up to 600&nbsp;kg as they begin accelerating after rounding a turn buoy. Their top speeds will generally be more than double the boat's speed, which means that the Pro men can reach speeds in excess of {{convert|116|km/h|mph}} and each turn will generally generate around 4 [[g-force|g of force]]. Essentially, slalom water skiers are using their body as a lever, which allows them to withstand loads that would otherwise not be possible for the human body.\n\n====Jump====\n\nWater ski jumpers use two long skis to ride over a water ski jump in an attempt to travel the longest distance. In a tournament, skiers are given three attempts to hit the ramp. The winner is the skier who travels the farthest calculated<ref name=manual-2003/> distance and successfully rides away.<ref name=ripnride>{{cite web|title=Jump Gold|work=Rip 'n Ride|publisher=Water Ski and Wakeboard Canada|url=http://www.ripnride.ca/#!__the-program/jump-gold|accessdate=1 October 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004222034/http://www.ripnride.ca/#!__the-program/jump-gold|archivedate=4 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> There are no style points, simply distance.<ref name=iwsf-history/>\n\nWater ski jumps have specific dimensions and the ramp height is adjustable. Skiers may choose their boat speed and ramp height, although there are maximums based the skier's gender and age. Professional ski jumpers have a maximum boat speed of {{convert|58|km/h|mph kn|abbr=on}}. The ramp height must be between {{convert|5|and|6|ft|m|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}. As a professional jumper approaches the ramp they will zigzag behind the boat in a series of cuts<ref name=ripnride/> to generate speed and angle. When the jumper hits the ramp they will generally be going over {{convert|112|km/h|mph|0}} and the load they have generated on the rope can be over {{convert|600|kg|lb}}.\n\n====Trick====\n[[File:Fischlham Mevisto Cup 2017 Trickski Theresa Schmidberger1-1.jpg|thumb|A competitor at a trick skiing event in Austria in 2017]]\nThe Trick competition has been described as the most technical of the three classic water skiing events.<ref name=iwsf-history/>\n\nTrick skiing uses small, oval-shaped or oblong water skis. Beginners generally use two skis while more advanced skiers use one.<ref name=iwsf-history/> The shorter, wider Trick ski has a front binding facing forward and a back binding facing at a 45\u00b0. It has a smooth bottom that allows it to turn over the surface of the water. According to official 2013 Tournament Rules for 3-event competition in the United States and the Pan-Am Games, skis used in the Tricks event must be a single ski without fins, although molded rails/grooves less than {{convert|1/4|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} are allowed, as are a foot pad cemented to the ski as a place for the rear foot; in addition, the ski must float with all bindings, fins, etc., installed.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The ski's configuration allows the skier to perform both surface and air tricks in quick succession.\n\nIn a tournament, skiers are given two 20-second runs during which they perform a series of their chosen tricks. In most cases, one pass is for hand tricks, which includes surface turns, rotations over the wake, and flips. The second pass is for toe tricks, which are done by doing wake turns and rotations with only a foot attaching them to the handle; the foot is either in the toehold part of the handle or, professionally, attached to the rope. <ref name=iwsf-history/>The toehold part of the handle does not allow the skier to let go of the handle if they lose their balance and fall into the water, therefore a person in the boat is required to release the rope from the boat using a quick release mechanism installed on the ski pylon. A trick cannot be repeated.<ref name=iwsf-history/> Each trick has a point value. A panel of five judges assesses which tricks were completed correctly and assigns that predetermined point value to each successfully completed trick. The skier with the most points wins.<ref name=iwsf-history/>\n\n===Barefoot water skiing===\n[[File:Barefoot Waterskier Michael French.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Barefoot skiing]] on [[Lake Ozonia]] in the Adirondacks]]\n{{main|Barefoot skiing}}\nA barefoot water skier should use a [[wetsuit]] instead of a [[life jacket]] because the wetsuit covers more of the body in case of a fall at high speed. The [[wetsuit]] also allows the skier to do starts in the water where they lie on their back. Unlike a normal life jacket, the \"barefoot wetsuit\" allows the skier to glide on their back on top of the water once they reach a high enough speed. The barefoot wetsuit is generally thicker in the back, rear, and chest for flotation and impact absorption.\n\nBarefoot skiing requires a higher speed because the skier's feet are smaller than skis, providing less lift. A rule of thumb for barefoot water skiing speed in miles per hour is (M/10)+18=S, where M equals the skier's weight in pounds. In other words, a {{convert|175|lb|abbr=on}} person would have to divide 175/10, which is 17.5; then simply add 17.5+18 which equals {{convert|35.5|mph|km/h}}.\n\nAnother tool used in barefoot water skiing is the barefoot boom. It provides a stable aluminum bar on the side of the boat where a short rope can be attached or the skier can grip the bar itself. The skier is within earshot of the people in the boat, providing a good platform for teaching. Once the bare footer is good enough, he/she will go behind the boat with a long rope.\n\nA beginner can wear shoes to decrease the necessary speed, lessen foot injury from choppy water, learn better technique, and master the sport.\n\n===Show skiing===\n[[File:4high.jpg|thumb|right|Water ski pyramid with 18 skiers Lake Zumbro, Minnesota, August 2010]]\nShow skiing is a type of water skiing where skiers perform tricks somewhat similar to those of [[gymnasts]] while being pulled by the boat. Traditional ski show acts include pyramids, ski doubles, freestyle jumping, and swivel skiing. Show skiing is normally performed in water ski shows, with elaborate costumes, choreography, music, and an announcer. Show teams may also compete regionally or nationally. In the US, each team member must be a member of [[USA Water Ski]] to compete.\n\nThe first organized show occurred in 1928.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.usawaterski.org/pages/divisions/showski/ShowSkiHistory.htm | title = National Show Ski Association: A Brief History of Show Skiing | publisher = USA Water Ski | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131105211331/http://www.usawaterski.org/pages/divisions/showski/ShowSkiHistory.htm | archivedate = 5 November 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>  The bi-annual World Show Ski Championship was inaugurated in September 2012 in Janesville, Wisconsin.<ref name=2014tournament>{{citation | url = http://www.iwsf.com/dbheadlines/headlinefiles/2014%20Show%20Ski%20Tournament.pdf | format = PDF | title = 2014 WORLD SHOW SKI TOURNAMENT | author = Rock Aqua Jays Water Ski Club, Inc. | publisher = International Waterski & Wakeboard Federation | accessdate = 29 October 2013 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131022053225/http://www.iwsf.com/dbheadlines/headlinefiles/2014%20Show%20Ski%20Tournament.pdf | archivedate = 22 October 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.usawaterski.org/pages/calendar.html | title = Master Calendar of Events | date = 28 October 2013 | publisher = USA Water Ski | quote = 9/12 - 9/14[2014] &ndash; 2nd IWWF World Show Ski Tournament &ndash; Janesville, Wis. | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131020030123/http://www.usawaterski.org/pages/calendar.html | archivedate = 20 October 2013 | df = dmy-all | access-date = 29 October 2013 }}</ref> Past competition included teams from Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, and the United States.<ref name=2014tournament/>\n\n===Freestyle jumping===\nFreestyle jumping is often related to show skiing. The goal is to go off the jump, perform one of many stunts, and successfully land back on the water. The most common freestyle stunts \u2013 in order of usual progression \u2013 would be a heli (360\u00b0), a flip (forwards), a gainer (a back flip), and a m\u00f6bius (back flip with 360\u00b0).\n\n[[File:Women's round of the Barry Carne Interstate Ski Challenge.jpg|thumb|Ski racing in Australia]]\n\n===Ski racing===\nWater ski racing consists of 1 or 2 skiers per boat who race around a set course behind boats set up for this type of event. It can occur in a 'circle' or lap format type racing - which is the format used for world championship events, held ever four years, or on river courses offering longer distances and higher speeds. Races can be timed events such as 20 minute races and up to 1 hour or on courses where race distance can be over 100&nbsp;km in length.\n\nSpeeds vary by classes but can reach up to 200&nbsp;km/h. Boats can be inboards or outboards and are generally between 19 and 21 feet in length. Outboards are commonly 300HP and Inboards around 1,300HP.\n\nAustralia is the identified home of ski racing, being responsible for some of the world's biggest races, including the world's fastest races, as well as a history of the majority of skier world championships.\n\nCurrent format world championship racing involves men's and women's formula 1 races (unrestricted), and men's and women formula 2 races (limited to single rig, 300&nbsp;hp outboards, as well as junior classes for under 16's.\n\nSome of the biggest races in the world include the Southern 80, in Echuca, Victoria, Australia, the diamond race, in Belgium, the Catalina ski race, in Long Beach, USA, and the Sydney Bridge to Bridge in Sydney, Australia. Races can have anywhere from 10 boats to 150 boats (in classes) competing.\n\n===Marathon===\nThe marathon event consists of each skier having to ski on all 6 pieces of equipment. \n\u2013 Single ski, Double skis, Single, Single finless, Double finless, a freeboard (a ski without bindings), and a fence paling.\n\n===Disabled===\nDisabled water skiing uses equipment or other adaptations to allow disabled people to compete in standard 3 event skiing.  Seated water skis, special handles, audio slalom gear, and other adaptations are all used for different disabilities.\n\n[[File:Sit-ski-slalom.jpg|thumb|a Disabled water skier on a Slalom sit ski]]\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[George A.

The sport requires sufficient area on a smooth stretch of water, one or two skis, a tow boat with tow rope, three people (depending on state boating laws), and a [[personal flotation device]].

Water skiing typically begins with a deep-water start. The skier enters the water with their skis on or they jump in without the skis on their feet, have the skis floated to them, and put them on while in the water. Most times it can be easier to put the skis on when they are wet. Once the skier has their skis on they will be thrown a tow rope from the boat, which they position between their skis. In the deep-water start, the skier crouches down in the water while holding onto the ski rope; they are in a cannonball position with their legs tucked into their chest, with skis pointing towards the sky and approximately {{convert|30|cm|ft|abbr=on}} of the ski out of the water. The skier can also perform a \"dry start\" by standing on the shore or a pier; however, this type of entry is recommended for professionals only. When the skier is ready (usually acknowledged by them yelling \"hit it\"), the driver accelerates the boat. As the boat accelerates and takes up the slack on the rope, the skier allows the boat to pull them out of the water by applying some [[muscle strength]] to get them! into an upright body position.\n\nBy leaning back and keeping the legs slightly bent, the skis will eventually plane out and the skier will start to glide over the water. The skier turns by shifting weight left or right. The skier's body weight should be balanced between the balls of the feet and the heels. While being towed, the skier's arms should be relaxed but still fully extended so as to reduce stress on the arms. The handle can be held vertically or horizontally, depending on whichever position is more comfortable for the skier.\n\nIn addition to the driver and the skier, a third person known as the ''spotter'' or the ''observer'' should be present. The spotter's job is to watch the skier and inform the driver if the skier falls. The spotter usually sits in a chair on the boat facing backwards to see the skier. The skier and the boat's occupants communicate using hand signals (see the [[#Safety measures|Safety]] section below).\n\n==Equipment==\n\n===Water===\n[[File:Chantalyy Lakes By The Cliff Side.jpg|thumb|A privately owned, man-made water ski lake commonly referred to as Chantalyy Lakes By The Cliff Side, located near Orangeville, Ontario seen with a slalom course and jump ramp]]\nWater skiing can take place on any type of water \u2013 such as a river, lake, or ocean \u2013 but calmer waters are ideal for recreational skiing.  There should be a {{convert|200|ft|m|sigfig=1|order=flip|adj=mid|-wide}} skiing space and the water should be at least {{convert|5|to|6|ft|m|1|order=flip}} deep. There must be enough space for the water skier to safely \"get up\", or successfully be in the upright skiing position. Skiers and their boat drivers must also have sufficient room to avoid hazards.\n\n===Skis===\n[[File:Datteln - KF2011 - Ostufer 06 ies.jpg|thumb|Several types of water skis and [[wetsuit]]s]]\nYounger skiers generally start out on children's skis, which consist of two skis tied together at their back and front. These connections mean that less strength is necessary for the child to keep the skis together. Sometimes these skis can come with a handle to help balance the skier as well.<ref name=childrens-skis>{{cite web | title = Children's Waterskis | url = http://www.mademan.com/mm/5-best-childrens-water-skis.html | first = Houlihan | last = Macaco | date = 27 January 2011 | work = Made Manual | publisher = Break Media | accessdate = 23 October 2013 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195032/http://www.mademan.com/mm/5-best-childrens-water-skis.html | archivedate = 29 October 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Children's skis are short \u2013 usually {{convert|45|-|60|in|cm|sigfig=2|order=flip}} long<ref name=childrens-skis/> \u2013 reflecting the skier's smaller size.

Generally the heavier the person, the bigger the skis will be. Length will also vary based on the type of water skiing being performed; jump skis, for example, are longer than skis used in regular straight-line recreational skiing or competitive slalom and trick skiing. A trick ski is around 40 inches long and wider than combo skis. Again the skier rides it with his or her dominant foot in front. It has no fins which allows for spins to be performed.\n\n===Boat===\n{{hatnote|This section describes water skiing behind a boat. For information about skiing with a cable installation, see the related Wikipedia article on [[cable skiing]].}}\n\nCompetition skiing uses specifically designed towboats. Most towboats have a very small hull and a flat bottom to minimize wake. A true tournament ski boat will have a direct drive motor shaft that centers the weight in the boat for an optimal wake shape. However, some recreational ski boats will have the motor placed in the back of the boat ([[v-drive]]), which creates a bigger wake. Permitted towboats used for tournament water skiing are the Mastercraft ProStar 197, MasterCraft ProStar 190, Nautique 200, Malibu Response TXi, and Centurion Carbon Pro.<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.usawaterski.org/pages/TournKit/AWSA/Chief%20Driver/ApprovedTournamentTowboats.pdf | format = PDF | title = American Water Ski Association Approved Tournament Towboats, 2013 | date = 15 January 2013 | publisher = American Water Ski Association | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120916234342/http://www.usawaterski.org/pages/TournKit/AWSA/Chief%20Driver/ApprovedTournamentTowboats.pdf | archivedate = 16 September 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> These boats have ability to pull skiers for trick skiing, jumping, and slalom.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.waterskimag.com/features/2013/03/04/best-of-boats-top-tournament-ski-boats/ | title = Best of Boats: Top Tournament Ski Boats 2013 | author = Geena | date = 7 May 2013 | publisher = Waterski Magazine | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130908021150/http://www.waterskimag.com/features/2013/03/04/best-of-boats-top-tournament-ski-boats/ | archivedate = 8 September 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nRecreational boats can serve as water skiing platforms as well as other purposes such as cruising and fishing.

The ski rope was made from a long [[Sash window|window sash]] cord.<ref name=ABC-history/> Samuelson never patented any of his ski equipment.\n\nThe first patent for water skis was issued to [[Fred Waller]], of Huntington, NY, on 27 October 1925, for skis he developed independently and marketed as \"Dolphin Akwa-Skees.\" Waller's skis were constructed of kiln-dried mahogany, as were some boats at that time. Jack Andresen patented the first trick ski, a shorter, fin-less water ski, in 1940.\n\nIn 1928 [http://www.usawaterskifoundation.org/#!don-ibsen/czd0 Don Ibsen] developed his own water skis on the West Coast, never having heard of Samuelson or Waller. In 1941 Don Ibsen founded The Olympic Water Ski Club in Seattle, WA. It was the first such club in America. Ibsen, a showman and entrepreneur, was one of the earliest manufacturers of water skis and was a leading enthusiast and promoter of the sport. In 1983 he was inducted into the Water Ski Hall of Fame in Winterhaven, FL.\n\nThe sport of water skiing remained an obscure activity for several years after 1922, until Samuelson performed water ski shows from Michigan to Florida. The American Water Ski Association formally acknowledged Samuelson in 1966 as the first recorded water skier in history. Samuelson was also the first ski racer, slalom skier, and the first organizer of a water ski show.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ralph W.

A demonstrating behind a motorboat was made to the Swedish public at the 100th anniversary of the [[Royal Swedish Yacht Club]] in [[Sandhamn]] outside [[Stockholm]] in 1930.<ref>Fredrik Ljungstr\u00f6m 1875-1964 Uppfinnare och inspirat\u00f6r (1999) by Olle Ljungstr\u00f6m, Sveriges Mekanisters Riksf\u00f6rening, {{ISBN|91-630-7639-X}}</ref>\n\nWater skiing gained international attention in the hands of famed promoter, [[Dick Pope, Sr.]], often referred to as the \"Father of American Water Skiing\" and founder of [[Cypress Gardens]] in [[Winter Haven, Florida]]. Pope cultivated a distinct image for his theme-park, which included countless photographs of the water skiers featured at the park. These photographs began appearing in magazines worldwide in the 1940s and 1950s, helping to bring international attention to the sport for the first time.<ref>The Lakeland Ledger, 29 January 1988. Vol. 82 No.99 Pg11A</ref> He was also the first person to complete a jump on water skis, jumping over a wooden ramp in 1928, for a distance of 25 feet.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pope, Sr.|first=Dick|title=Water Skiing|year=1958|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|pages=52}}</ref> His son, [[Dick Pope, Jr.]], is the inventor of bare-foot skiing. Both men are in the [[Water Ski Hall of Fame and Museum|Water Ski Hall of Fame]]. Today, Winter Haven, Florida, with its famous [[Chain of Lakes (Winter Haven)|Chain of Lakes]], remains an important city for water skiing, with several major ski schools operating there.\n\nWater skiing has developed over time. Water skiing tournaments and water skiing competitions have been organized. As an exhibition sport, water skiing was included in the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympics]]. The first National Show Ski Tournament was held in 1974, and the first ever National Intercollegiate Water Ski Championships were held in 1979. The Home CARE US National Water Ski Challenge, the first competition for people with disabilities, was organized ten years later.\n\nThe first patented design of a water ski which included carbon fiber was that of Hani Audah at SPORT labs in 2001. Its first inclusion in tournament slalom skiing was in 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportkc.org/sportkc.aspx?pgID=1180 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323232839/http://www.sportkc.org/sportkc.aspx?pgID=1180 |archivedate=23 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Disciplines ==\n\n===3-event tournament water skiing===\nIn the United States, there are over 900 sanctioned water ski competitions each summer.<ref name=ws-profile/> [[Orlando, Florida]] is considered to be the competitive 3-event waterskiing capital of the world.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.waterskimag.com/features/2015/08/05/how-orlando-became-the-mecca-of-water-skiing|title=How Orlando Became the Mecca of Water Skiing|work=Waterski Magazine|access-date=2017-05-02|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160904012142/http://www.waterskimag.com/features/2015/08/05/how-orlando-became-the-mecca-of-water-skiing|archivedate=4 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Competitive water skiing consists of three events: slalom, jump, and trick.<ref name=ws-profile/><ref name=iwsf-history>{{cite web | url = http://www.iwsfranking.com/WSWC/history.htm | title = World Championship History | publisher = Water Ski World Cup (WSWC) | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061019114906/http://www.iwsfranking.com/WSWC/history.htm | archivedate = 19 October 2006 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n====Slalom====\n[[File:Slalom Good Pic.jpg|thumb|17-year-old Toronto skier [[Chantal Singer]] slaloming at the 2012 Canadian National Waterski Championships in [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]]]]\nIn an attempt to become as agile as possible, slalom water skiers use only one ski with feet oriented forward, one in front of the other. Slalom skis are narrow and long, at {{convert|57|-|70|in|cm|0}} depending on the height and weight of the skier. The two forward-facing bindings vary: they can be made of rubber or thick plastic, and they can be designed more like a [[Ski binding|snow ski binding]] or more like a [[Inline skates|roller blade boot]].\n\nSlalom skiing involves a multi-buoy course that the skier must go around in order to complete the pass. A complete slalom water ski course consists of 26 buoys. There are entrance gates at the beginning and end of the course that the skier must go between, and there are 6 turn buoys that the skier must navigate around in a zigzag pattern. The remainder of the buoys are for the driver to ensure the boat goes straight down the center of the course. For a tournament to be sanctioned as 'record capable' by the [[International Waterski & Wakeboard Federation]] (IWWF), the entire course must be surveyed prior to competition by a land surveyor to ensure its accuracy. The drivers boat path must be verified as well to ensure that all skiers are getting a fair pull.\n\nEvery consecutive<ref name=iwsf-history/> pass is harder than the pass before it. When a pass is completed, the boat is sped up by {{convert|3|km/h|mph|0}} until the maximum speed has been reached for the division, based on the skier's gender and age ({{convert|55|km/h|mph|0}} for women and {{convert|58|km/h|mph|0}} for men). After the skier has run their maximum speed pass, the rope is shortened at specific increments to make it more difficult to reach the buoy width. In a tournament, the boat speeds up or the rope shortens until the skier fails to complete the slalom course by falling or not getting around a buoy.<ref name=iwsf-history/>\n\nA skier's score is based upon the number of successful buoys cleared, the speed of the boat, and the length of the rope. In a tournament, skiers choose the starting boat speed and rope length (with a maximum length of {{convert|22.86|m|ft|0}}). Professional water skiers will typically start at the max speed of {{convert|58|km/h|mph|0}} with a rope that has already been shortened to {{convert|13|m|ft}}. The skier with the most buoys wins the competition.<ref name=iwsf-history/>\n\nThe turn buoys are positioned {{convert|11.5|m|ft}} away from the center of the slalom course so as the rope is shortened beyond that the skiers are required to use the momentum generated through their turns to swing up on the side of the boat and reach out in order to get their ski around the next buoy. At this rope length the skier's body is experiencing intense isometric contractions and extreme upper body torque with loads of up to 600&nbsp;kg as they begin accelerating after rounding a turn buoy. Their top speeds will generally be more than double the boat's speed, which means that the Pro men can reach speeds in excess of {{convert|116|km/h|mph}} and each turn will generally generate around 4 [[g-force|g of force]]. Essentially, slalom water skiers are using their body as a lever, which allows them to withstand loads that would otherwise not be possible for the human body.\n\n====Jump====\n\nWater ski jumpers use two long skis to ride over a water ski jump in an attempt to travel the longest distance. In a tournament, skiers are given three attempts to hit the ramp. The winner is the skier who travels the farthest calculated<ref name=manual-2003/> distance and successfully rides away.<ref name=ripnride>{{cite web|title=Jump Gold|work=Rip 'n Ride|publisher=Water Ski and Wakeboard Canada|url=http://www.ripnride.ca/#!__the-program/jump-gold|accessdate=1 October 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004222034/http://www.ripnride.ca/#!__the-program/jump-gold|archivedate=4 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> There are no style points, simply distance.<ref name=iwsf-history/>\n\nWater ski jumps have specific dimensions and the ramp height is adjustable. Skiers may choose their boat speed and ramp height, although there are maximums based the skier's gender and age. Professional ski jumpers have a maximum boat speed of {{convert|58|km/h|mph kn|abbr=on}}. The ramp height must be between {{convert|5|and|6|ft|m|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}. As a professional jumper approaches the ramp they will zigzag behind the boat in a series of cuts<ref name=ripnride/> to generate speed and angle. When the jumper hits the ramp they will generally be going over {{convert|112|km/h|mph|0}} and the load they have generated on the rope can be over {{convert|600|kg|lb}}.\n\n====Trick====\n[[File:Fischlham Mevisto Cup 2017 Trickski Theresa Schmidberger1-1.jpg|thumb|A competitor at a trick skiing event in Austria in 2017]]\nThe Trick competition has been described as the most technical of the three classic water skiing events.<ref name=iwsf-history/>\n\nTrick skiing uses small, oval-shaped or oblong water skis. Beginners generally use two skis while more advanced skiers use one.<ref name=iwsf-history/> The shorter, wider Trick ski has a front binding facing forward and a back binding facing at a 45\u00b0. It has a smooth bottom that allows it to turn over the surface of the water. According to official 2013 Tournament Rules for 3-event competition in the United States and the Pan-Am Games, skis used in the Tricks event must be a single ski without fins, although molded rails/grooves less than {{convert|1/4|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} are allowed, as are a foot pad cemented to the ski as a place for the rear foot; in addition, the ski must float with all bindings, fins, etc., installed.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The ski's configuration allows the skier to perform both surface and air tricks in quick succession.\n\nIn a tournament, skiers are given two 20-second runs during which they perform a series of their chosen tricks. In most cases, one pass is for hand tricks, which includes surface turns, rotations over the wake, and flips. The second pass is for toe tricks, which are done by doing wake turns and rotations with only a foot attaching them to the handle; the foot is either in the toehold part of the handle or, professionally, attached to the rope. <ref name=iwsf-history/>The toehold part of the handle does not allow the skier to let go of the handle if they lose their balance and fall into the water, therefore a person in the boat is required to release the rope from the boat using a quick release mechanism installed on the ski pylon. A trick cannot be repeated.<ref name=iwsf-history/> Each trick has a point value. A panel of five judges assesses which tricks were completed correctly and assigns that predetermined point value to each successfully completed trick. The skier with the most points wins.<ref name=iwsf-history/>\n\n===Barefoot water skiing===\n[[File:Barefoot Waterskier Michael French.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Barefoot skiing]] on [[Lake Ozonia]] in the Adirondacks]]\n{{main|Barefoot skiing}}\nA barefoot water skier should use a [[wetsuit]] instead of a [[life jacket]] because the wetsuit covers more of the body in case of a fall at high speed. The [[wetsuit]] also allows the skier to do starts in the water where they lie on their back. Unlike a normal life jacket, the \"barefoot wetsuit\" allows the skier to glide on their back on top of the water once they reach a high enough speed. The barefoot wetsuit is generally thicker in the back, rear, and chest for flotation and impact absorption.\n\nBarefoot skiing requires a higher speed because the skier's feet are smaller than skis, providing less lift. A rule of thumb for barefoot water skiing speed in miles per hour is (M/10)+18=S, where M equals the skier's weight in pounds. In other words, a {{convert|175|lb|abbr=on}} person would have to divide 175/10, which is 17.5; then simply add 17.5+18 which equals {{convert|35.5|mph|km/h}}.\n\nAnother tool used in barefoot water skiing is the barefoot boom. It provides a stable aluminum bar on the side of the boat where a short rope can be attached or the skier can grip the bar itself. The skier is within earshot of the people in the boat, providing a good platform for teaching. Once the bare footer is good enough, he/she will go behind the boat with a long rope.\n\nA beginner can wear shoes to decrease the necessary speed, lessen foot injury from choppy water, learn better technique, and master the sport.\n\n===Show skiing===\n[[File:4high.jpg|thumb|right|Water ski pyramid with 18 skiers Lake Zumbro, Minnesota, August 2010]]\nShow skiing is a type of water skiing where skiers perform tricks somewhat similar to those of [[gymnasts]] while being pulled by the boat. Traditional ski show acts include pyramids, ski doubles, freestyle jumping, and swivel skiing. Show skiing is normally performed in water ski shows, with elaborate costumes, choreography, music, and an announcer. Show teams may also compete regionally or nationally. In the US, each team member must be a member of [[USA Water Ski]] to compete.\n\nThe first organized show occurred in 1928.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.usawaterski.org/pages/divisions/showski/ShowSkiHistory.htm | title = National Show Ski Association: A Brief History of Show Skiing | publisher = USA Water Ski | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131105211331/http://www.usawaterski.org/pages/divisions/showski/ShowSkiHistory.htm | archivedate = 5 November 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>  The bi-annual World Show Ski Championship was inaugurated in September 2012 in Janesville, Wisconsin.<ref name=2014tournament>{{citation | url = http://www.iwsf.com/dbheadlines/headlinefiles/2014%20Show%20Ski%20Tournament.pdf | format = PDF | title = 2014 WORLD SHOW SKI TOURNAMENT | author = Rock Aqua Jays Water Ski Club, Inc. | publisher = International Waterski & Wakeboard Federation | accessdate = 29 October 2013 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131022053225/http://www.iwsf.com/dbheadlines/headlinefiles/2014%20Show%20Ski%20Tournament.pdf | archivedate = 22 October 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.usawaterski.org/pages/calendar.html | title = Master Calendar of Events | date = 28 October 2013 | publisher = USA Water Ski | quote = 9/12 - 9/14[2014] &ndash; 2nd IWWF World Show Ski Tournament &ndash; Janesville, Wis. | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131020030123/http://www.usawaterski.org/pages/calendar.html | archivedate = 20 October 2013 | df = dmy-all | access-date = 29 October 2013 }}</ref> Past competition included teams from Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, and the United States.<ref name=2014tournament/>\n\n===Freestyle jumping===\nFreestyle jumping is often related to show skiing. The goal is to go off the jump, perform one of many stunts, and successfully land back on the water. The most common freestyle stunts \u2013 in order of usual progression \u2013 would be a heli (360\u00b0), a flip (forwards), a gainer (a back flip), and a m\u00f6bius (back flip with 360\u00b0).\n\n[[File:Women's round of the Barry Carne Interstate Ski Challenge.jpg|thumb|Ski racing in Australia]]\n\n===Ski racing===\nWater ski racing consists of 1 or 2 skiers per boat who race around a set course behind boats set up for this type of event. It can occur in a 'circle' or lap format type racing - which is the format used for world championship events, held ever four years, or on river courses offering longer distances and higher speeds. Races can be timed events such as 20 minute races and up to 1 hour or on courses where race distance can be over 100&nbsp;km in length.\n\nSpeeds vary by classes but can reach up to 200&nbsp;km/h. Boats can be inboards or outboards and are generally between 19 and 21 feet in length. Outboards are commonly 300HP and Inboards around 1,300HP.\n\nAustralia is the identified home of ski racing, being responsible for some of the world's biggest races, including the world's fastest races, as well as a history of the majority of skier world championships.\n\nCurrent format world championship racing involves men's and women's formula 1 races (unrestricted), and men's and women formula 2 races (limited to single rig, 300&nbsp;hp outboards, as well as junior classes for under 16's.\n\nSome of the biggest races in the world include the Southern 80, in Echuca, Victoria, Australia, the diamond race, in Belgium, the Catalina ski race, in Long Beach, USA, and the Sydney Bridge to Bridge in Sydney, Australia. Races can have anywhere from 10 boats to 150 boats (in classes) competing.\n\n===Marathon===\nThe marathon event consists of each skier having to ski on all 6 pieces of equipment. \n\u2013 Single ski, Double skis, Single, Single finless, Double finless, a freeboard (a ski without bindings), and a fence paling.\n\n===Disabled===\nDisabled water skiing uses equipment or other adaptations to allow disabled people to compete in standard 3 event skiing.  Seated water skis, special handles, audio slalom gear, and other adaptations are all used for different disabilities.\n\n[[File:Sit-ski-slalom.jpg|thumb|a Disabled water skier on a Slalom sit ski]]\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[George A.
