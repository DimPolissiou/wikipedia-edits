It holds an ambitious village Gala every July in which local girls are picked to be the Gala Queen and her attendants. The village will hold events daily including a games day which involves an race through the village in wheelbarrows or prams followed by \"It's a knockout\" style team games. The gala is a bigger event than might be expected for such a small village, and attracts many visitors from surrounding areas.\n\n==Features==\nThere is a lot of forestry in this region. The gardens of Dallas Lodge are often open to the public. The Church of St. Michael in the village dates from 1793, but is built on the site of an earlier church known from records to have been in existence in 1226.\n\n==Notable people==\n[[William Anderson (VC)|William Anderson]] [[Victoria Cross|VC]] (November 1885 \u2013 13 March 1915), a [[World War I]] recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]], was born in Dallas.<ref>[http://www.victoriacross.org.uk/suffolk.htm victoriacross.org.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926224018/http://www.victoriacross.org.uk/suffolk.htm |date=26 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Dallas Castle==\n[[File:DallasCastle.JPG|thumbnail|200px|left|Ruins of Dallas Castle]]\n\nDallas Castle is barely standing, with only one small wall remaining.

It holds an ambitious village Gala every July in which local girls are picked to be the Gala Queen and her attendants. The village will hold events daily including a games day which involves an race through the village in wheelbarrows or prams followed by \"It's a knockout\" style team games. The gala is a bigger event than might be expected for such a small village, and attracts many visitors from surrounding areas.\n\n==Features==\nThere is a lot of forestry in this region. The gardens of Dallas Lodge are often open to the public. The Church of St. Michael in the village dates from 1793, but is built on the site of an earlier church known from records to have been in existence in 1226.\n\n==Notable people==\n[[William Anderson (VC)|William Anderson]] [[Victoria Cross|VC]] (November 1885 \u2013 13 March 1915), a [[World War I]] recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]], was born in Dallas.<ref>[http://www.victoriacross.org.uk/suffolk.htm victoriacross.org.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926224018/http://www.victoriacross.org.uk/suffolk.htm |date=26 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Dallas Castle==\n[[File:DallasCastle.JPG|thumbnail|200px|left|Ruins of Dallas Castle]]\n\nDallas Castle is barely standing, with only one small wall remaining.
