It is located 82&nbsp;km towards East from District headquarters [[Mangalore]], 31&nbsp;km from [[Puttur, Karnataka|Puttur]] and 272&nbsp;km from State capital [[Bangalore]].\n\n==Etymology==\nAs per the locals, Kadaba was ruled by 'Kadamba' dynasty hence the name 'Kadaba'. However, there are no valid evidence proving the same. As per the Historians Kadaba had been called Kadamma (Kadave, a male deer) since the animals were found in large number here in the past. The main languages are [[Tulu language|Tulu]], [[Kannada]], [[Hindi]], [[Malayalam]], [[Beary language|Beary]].\nKadaba taluk is the place where all religions are free to practice their rituals.\nDuring the festivals all religion people gather in the temples, churches and mosques and worship and show harmony.\n\n==History==\n\nThe demand for Taluk status for Kadaba was first raised in 1961. The B.M Hundekar taluk reorganisation committee, in its recommendations in 1985, had suggested the formation of Kadaba taluk. Later, the Gaddigowdar Committee had also recommended the same. The government had appointed a special Tahsildar for Kadaba in 2001. However, in 2009, the Taluk reconstitution committee under the chairmanship of M.B Prakash excluded Kadaba in its recommendations. \n\nLocal leaders and well wishers continued the demand for Kadaba Taluk under 'Kadaba Taluk Rachana Horata Samiti' president C.C Philip and Vice President Kushalappa Gowda resulting in the formation of new Taluk on January 1st 2018 followed by official inauguration on March 8th 2019 by Karnataka Revenue Minister R.V. Deshpande and Karnataka Urban Development & DK District In-charge Minister U.T. Khader. \n\nIn 2013, then ruling BJP government under Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar had declared Kadaba as Taluk along with Moodbidri, Byndoor and Brahmavar of Mangalore district. On 15 March 2017, Karnataka government under Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has re-declared Kadaba as Taluk again and from 1 January 2018 it is officially functioning as Taluk headquarters. Kadaba taluk is carved out of Puttur and Sullia taluks and the new taluk comprises nine villages from Puttur taluk and seven villages of Sullia. The creation of Kadaba taluk will benefit the people who have been travelling 65&nbsp;km to the Puttur taluk office to get any work done. Now, the people of Subramnya, Nelyadi, Shiradi can reach the taluk head office by travelling a distance of only 10 to 20&nbsp;km.\n\n==Education==\nKadaba has Schools and Colleges in and around though Professional colleges are yet to start in Kadaba. Govt. Primary, High Schools and PU College and St. Joachims Institutions (founded in 1926) are the oldest schools of Kadaba. Other English medium schools are also popular here.\nApart from promises from different governments, Kadaba is yet to be sanctioned with a Government First Grade college. \n\nHowever, in Oct. 2017, then Chief Minister Siddaramaih laid the foundation stone for the Veterinary College at Koila to be built under the management of Karnataka Veterinary, Animal and Fisheries Sciences University. The college campus comprising Veterinary Hospital, College, Hostel and Farm will be spread in 247 acres of land and hopes to improve animal resource in the State. Karnataka Government has plans to develop Koila Veterinary College as a Breeding Center for Cattle along with preservation of local varieties of Cattle such as Malenadu Gidda.\n\n==Pilgrimage and Tourism==\nFamous Pilgrimage places like Kukke Subramanya and Dharmasthala are easily accessible from Kadaba.\n\n'''Pilgrim Centers:'''\n\nThere are few pilgrim centers around Kadaba, which made its existence through regular visits by tourists every year.

However, there are no valid evidence proving the same. As per the Historians Kadaba had been called Kadamma (Kadave, a male deer) since the animals were found in large number here in the past. The main languages are [[Tulu language|Tulu]], [[Kannada]], [[Hindi]], [[Malayalam]], [[Beary language|Beary]].\nKadaba taluk is the place where all religions are free to practice their rituals.\nDuring the festivals all religion people gather in the temples, churches and mosques and worship and show harmony.\n\n==History==\n\nThe demand for Taluk status for Kadaba was first raised in 1961. The B.M Hundekar taluk reorganisation committee, in its recommendations in 1985, had suggested the formation of Kadaba taluk. Later, the Gaddigowdar Committee had also recommended the same. The government had appointed a special Tahsildar for Kadaba in 2001. However, in 2009, the Taluk reconstitution committee under the chairmanship of M.B Prakash excluded Kadaba in its recommendations. \n\nLocal leaders and well wishers continued the demand for Kadaba Taluk under 'Kadaba Taluk Rachana Horata Samiti' president C.C Philip and Vice President Kushalappa Gowda resulting in the formation of new Taluk on January 1st 2018 followed by official inauguration on March 8th 2019 by Karnataka Revenue Minister R.V. Deshpande and Karnataka Urban Development & DK District In-charge Minister U.T. Khader. \n\nIn 2013, then ruling BJP government under Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar had declared Kadaba as Taluk along with Moodbidri, Byndoor and Brahmavar of Mangalore district. On 15 March 2017, Karnataka government under Chief Mnister Siddaramaiah has re-declared Kadaba as Taluk again and from 1 January 2018 it is officially functioning as Taluk headquarters. Kadaba taluk is carved out of Puttur and Sullia taluks and the new taluk comprises nine villages from Puttur taluk and seven villages of Sullia. The creation of Kadaba taluk will benefit the people who have been travelling 65&nbsp;km to the Puttur taluk office to get any work done. Now, the people of Subramnya, Nelyadi, Shiradi can reach the taluk head office by travelling a distance of only 10 to 20&nbsp;km.\n\n==Education==\nKadaba has Schools and Colleges in and around though Professional colleges are yet to start in Kadaba. Govt. Primary, High Schools and PU College and St. Joachims Institutions (founded in 1926) are the oldest schools of Kadaba. Other English medium schools are also popular here.\nApart from promises from different governments, Kadaba is yet to be sanctioned with a Government First Grade college. \n\nHowever, in Oct. 2017, then Chief Minister Siddaramaih laid the foundation stone for the Veterinary College at Koila to be built under the management of Karnataka Veterinary, Animal and Fisheries Sciences University. The college campus comprising Veterinary Hospital, College, Hostel and Farm will be spread in 247 acres of land and hopes to improve animal resource in the State. Karnataka Government has plans to develop Koila Veterinary College as a Breeding Center for Cattle along with preservation of local varieties of Cattle such as Malenadu Gidda.\n\n==Pilgrimage and Tourism==\nFamous Pilgrimage places like Kukke Subramanya and Dharmasthala are easily accessible from Kadaba.\n\n'''Pilgrim Centers:'''\n\nThere are few pilgrim centers around Kadaba, which made its existence through regular visits by tourists every year.

It began on 15 April 2011 and ended on 5 November 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Summary - Virsliga 2011 - Latvia|url=https://int.soccerway.com/national/latvia/virsliga/2011/regular-season/|publisher=Soccerway|accessdate=7 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe competition was won by [[FK Ventspils]], who thus qualified for the [[2012\u201313 UEFA Champions League]]. Runners-up [[FK Liep\u0101jas Metalurgs|Liep\u0101jas Metalurgs]] and third-placed sides [[FC Daugava|Daugava Daugavpils]] earned spots for the [[2012\u201313 UEFA Europa League]]. On the bottom end of the table, [[JFK Olimps/RFS]] were relegated after losing their play-off series against [[FK Spartaks J\u016brmala|Spartaks J\u016brmala]].\n\nAll nine clubs played every other club four times during the course of the season: twice at home and twice away. In addition, there will be no direct relegation to the [[Latvian First League]] this year.<ref name=ClubMeeting>{{cite web|title=Virsl\u012bgas \u010dempion\u0101ta klubu un LFF san\u0101ksmes l\u0113mumi|url=http://www.lff.lv/lv/news/2011/jan/84/|publisher=[[Latvian Football Federation]]|accessdate=17 February 2011|language=Latvian}}</ref>\n\n==Teams==\n[[FK Jaun\u012bba R\u012bga|Jaun\u012bba R\u012bga]] finished [[2010 Latvian Higher League|the previous year]]'s competition in tenth place and were relegated to the Latvian First League. This ended a one-year stay in the top flight. Promoted to the Higher League from the First Division automatically were the previous season's First Division champions, [[FB Gulbene 2005|Gulbene 2005]], who are taking part in the top flight for the first time in their history in 2011.\n\n[[FC Tranzit]] finished 9th in the 2010 Higher League competition and were supposed to compete in a promotion/relegation playoff against the runners-up of the First Division, [[FC J\u016brmala]]. However, before this playoff took place, Tranzit informed the [[Latvian Football Federation]] that they were forfeiting their place in the Higher League altogether, ending a two-year stay in the top flight.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Therefore, FC J\u016brmala were promoted to the Higher League automatically. Like Gulbene, they are competing in the top flight for the first time in their history in 2011.\n\nFinally, [[SK Bl\u0101zma]] decided to withdraw from the league during the off-season. This ended a three-year stay in the top flight.

The tectonic processes on the high Atlas proabaly lead to most of the Volcanic manifestations locally.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/> \n\n===Stratigraphy===\nThe formation is subdivided on several stratigraphic levels, starting with the so called  facies of term A, composed by  [[Gypsum]] and [[Salt]], from Triassic age, supported by the presence of Volcanic Intercalations of basalt.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain0 /><ref name=Allain1 /><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Above that, there are carbonates of term B alternated at the first with [[Dolomite (rock)|Dolomite]]s, [[Pelite]]s and [[Limestone]]s along with Marly-[[Silt]] crimes with plant debris, which had regular influence  of a marine environment.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> That is proved by the presence of [[Ooid]]s, [[Oncolith]]s, debris of [[Mollusc]]s and benthic [[Foraminifer]]s, being dissolved and recrystallized as [[Sparite]].<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The third level shows a transition between marine and continental deposits, through carbonate palustrine levels and [[Caliche]] horizons, being continental layers superimposed in stratigraphic continuity over the marine carbonates of the lower Lias ([[Sinemurian]]-[[Hettangian]]).<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Those continental layers are rich in [[Coarse structure|Coarse]] Volcano-detrital episodes as result of a sedimentary  process of  high sedimentation rates, where the strata,  including the deposit with Dinosaur fossils, where deposited on a short time interval, where Middle Jurassic [[Bajocian]]-[[Bathonian]] carbonate levels, frequent within the Atlas domain, do not exist not in Toundoute.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The sedimentation on the Toundoute member have some characteristics, such as  lenticular channels with [[Sieve]]-[[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]] of ~5 m thick (\u2264 5m) for visible decametric, composed of several materials, like  Volcanic products, as  blocks of volcanic rocks such as sands made of [[Feldspar]]s, black ferruginous grains from the surface of volcanic rocks on dry periods, siliceous green fragments from post eruption processes  ([[Vein (geology)|Vein]]s, [[Microgeode]]s, [[Nippled Concretions]]), [[Limestone]] debris with traces of roots and cracks, where in some parts traces dark fine bushy algae filaments are still visible, similar to te genus [[Girvanella]] blue-green algae.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Other materials include [[Schist]] and Vein [[Quartz]], witouth bone and wood debris with a good cellular structure.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The [[Floodplain]]-like deposits are divided in two parts, with hard [[Limestone]] nodules, pink or brick and very irregular, typical of profiles of [[Calcimorph Soils]] formed on climates with pronounced dry phases. Those nodules had a visible reorganization in the channels, as a result of erosion of the alluvial plain by the fluvial network.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain0 /> Finally there are present interlays of fine sandstone often laminated that mark the [[Flood]] facies from channels in period of flood, being composed only by plagioclase [[Feldspar]]s and in a lesser proportion of [[Orthoclase]]s, along  with small ferruginous grains or fine silts of [[Quartz]].<ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 />\nThere is documentation of warm climatic conditions locally, that alternating wet and dry periods, as is seen on the other formations gave rise to soils with differentiated limestone profiles, such as [[Pedogenetic Nodules]] or [[Caliche]].<ref name=\"Montenat\"/> The accumulation in the channels from calcimorphic soil profiles shows the presence of an active erosion on soils with probably sparse vegetation.<ref name=\"Ettaki, M. 2000\"/><ref name=Allain0 /><ref name=Allain1 /> \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Stratigraphy of the Toundoute Continental Series\n!Unit \n!Lithology\n!Thickness (metres)\n!Dinosaur fossils\n|-\n|[[Alluvium]]\n|Holocene conglomerate\n|\n|\n|-\n|H\n|Clay-sandstone series\n|\u2265 100 \n|\n|-\n|G\n|Clay-sandstone series, with gypsum layer present at the top, just below this a second dinosaur bearing horizon is present with very similar lithology to unit F.\n|50 \n|''[[Tazoudasaurus]], [[Berberosaurus]]''<ref name=\"Taquet4\"/>\n|-\n|F\n|Greenish grey clay-marl, detrital gravel to pebble sized clasts with lignite and bones.\n|\u2264 5 \n|Present, indeterminate\n|-\n|E\n|Alternation of red brown clay, fine sandstone and sandstone coarse conglomerates\n|100 \n|\n|-\n|D\n|Clay, fine sandstone and conglomerate, large volcanic rocks present.<ref>Ellero, A., Ottria, G., Malus\u00e0, M.

The facies of the formation follow a deposition typical of Alluvial Plains.<ref name=Jenny1 /><ref name=Ibouh1 /> It also recovers a succession of reddish brown tones predominantly terrigenous: [[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]]s, [[Sandstone]], clays related to  [[Paleosoils]], along with dolomitized [[Limestone]]. The Wazzant formation has a notorious proximal character compared to the Azilal formation.  These deposits fill in many small tear pools in the Atlas Central.<ref>Laville, E. (1978).

The predominantly terrigenous deposits of this formation suggest they were  deposited in continental setting, influenced by at least 6 different river channels, that trace it's path to the Atlas Gulf. On the [[Toarcian]]-[[Aalenian]] transgression, the High Atlas domain experienced a long process of extension and rifting, recorded by the presence of marine carbonates and shales, found on the Wazzant Formation Beds. It is related to the formation of the [[Atlantic Rifting]] to the west and of the formation of the [[Tethys]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} to the north.<ref>El Harfi, A., Guiraud, M., & Lang, J. (2006).

The tectonic processes on the high Atlas proabaly lead to most of the Volcanic manifestations locally.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/> \n\n===Stratigraphy===\nThe formation is subdivided on several stratigraphic levels, starting with the so called  facies of term A, composed by  [[Gypsum]] and [[Salt]], from Triassic age, supported by the presence of Volcanic Intercalations of basalt.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain0 /><ref name=Allain1 /><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Above that, there are carbonates of term B alternated at the first with [[Dolomite (rock)|Dolomite]]s, [[Pelite]]s and [[Limestone]]s along with Marly-[[Silt]] crimes with plant debris, which had regular influence  of a marine environment.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> That is proved by the presence of [[Ooid]]s, [[Oncolith]]s, debris of [[Mollusc]]s and benthic [[Foraminifer]]s, being dissolved and recrystallized as [[Sparite]].<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The third level shows a transition between marine and continental deposits, through carbonate palustrine levels and [[Caliche]] horizons, being continental layers superimposed in stratigraphic continuity over the marine carbonates of the lower Lias ([[Sinemurian]]-[[Hettangian]]).<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Those continental layers are rich in [[Coarse structure|Coarse]] Volcano-detrital episodes as result of a sedimentary  process of  high sedimentation rates, where the strata,  including the deposit with Dinosaur fossils, where deposited on a short time interval, where Middle Jurassic [[Bajocian]]-[[Bathonian]] carbonate levels, frequent within the Atlas domain, do not exist not in Toundoute.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The sedimentation on the Toundoute member have some characteristics, such as  lenticular channels with [[Sieve]]-[[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]] of ~5 m thick (\u2264 5m) for visible decametric, composed of several materials, like  Volcanic products, as  blocks of volcanic rocks such as sands made of [[Feldspar]]s, black ferruginous grains from the surface of volcanic rocks on dry periods, siliceous green fragments from post eruption processes  ([[Vein (geology)|Vein]]s, [[Microgeode]]s, [[Nippled Concretions]]), [[Limestone]] debris with traces of roots and cracks, where in some parts traces dark fine bushy algae filaments are still visible, similar to te genus [[Girvanella]] blue-green algae.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Other materials include [[Schist]] and Vein [[Quartz]], witouth bone and wood debris with a good cellular structure.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The [[Floodplain]]-like deposits are divided in two parts, with hard [[Limestone]] nodules, pink or brick and very irregular, typical of profiles of [[Calcimorph Soils]] formed on climates with pronounced dry phases. Those nodules had a visible reorganization in the channels, as a result of erosion of the alluvial plain by the fluvial network.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain0 /> Finally there are present interlays of fine sandstone often laminated that mark the [[Flood]] facies from channels in period of flood, being composed only by plagioclase [[Feldspar]]s and in a lesser proportion of [[Orthoclase]]s, along  with small ferruginous grains or fine silts of [[Quartz]].<ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 />\nThere is documentation of warm climatic conditions locally, that alternating wet and dry periods, as is seen on the other formations gave rise to soils with differentiated limestone profiles, such as [[Pedogenetic Nodules]] or [[Caliche]].<ref name=\"Montenat\"/> The accumulation in the channels from calcimorphic soil profiles shows the presence of an active erosion on soils with probably sparse vegetation.<ref name=\"Ettaki, M. 2000\"/><ref name=Allain0 /><ref name=Allain1 /> \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Stratigraphy of the Toundoute Continental Series\n!Unit \n!Lithology\n!Thickness (metres)\n!Dinosaur fossils\n|-\n|[[Alluvium]]\n|Holocene conglomerate\n|\n|\n|-\n|H\n|Clay-sandstone series\n|\u2265 100 \n|\n|-\n|G\n|Clay-sandstone series, with gypsum layer present at the top, just below this a second dinosaur bearing horizon is present with very similar lithology to unit F.\n|50 \n|''[[Tazoudasaurus]], [[Berberosaurus]]''<ref name=\"Taquet4\"/>\n|-\n|F\n|Greenish grey clay-marl, detrital gravel to pebble sized clasts with lignite and bones.\n|\u2264 5 \n|Present, indeterminate\n|-\n|E\n|Alternation of red brown clay, fine sandstone and sandstone coarse conglomerates\n|100 \n|\n|-\n|D\n|Clay, fine sandstone and conglomerate, large volcanic rocks present.<ref>Ellero, A., Ottria, G., Malus\u00e0, M.

It was the first major battle fought between [[Kingdom of Greece|Greek]] forces under Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces under General [[Hasan Tahsin Pasha]] during the [[First Balkan War]]. The battle began when the Greek army attacked the Ottoman defensive line at Sarandaporo pass, which connected [[Thessaly]] with central [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].\n\nDespite being perceived as impregnable by its defenders, the main body of the Greek forces managed to advance deep inside the pass, while auxiliary units broke through the Ottoman flanks. The Ottomans abandoned their defensive line during the night, fearing encirclement. The Greek victory at Sarandaporo opened the way for the capture of [[Servia, Greece|Servia]] and [[Kozani]].\n\n==Background==\nThe disastrous Greek defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]] of 1897 exposed major flaws in the [[Greek Army]]'s organization, training and logistics. Upon his appointment in December 1905, [[Georgios Theotokis]] became the first post-war Greek prime minister to focus his attention on strengthening the army. He established the National Defense Fund which financed the purchase of large quantities of ammunition. In addition a new [[table of organization]] was introduced for the country's [[Greek Navy|navy]] and army, the latter being augmented by numerous artillery batteries. Theotokis' resignation in January 1909 and the perceived neglect of the armed forces by his successor resulted in the [[Goudi coup]] seven months later. Rather than taking power for themselves, the putschists invited Cretan politician [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] to rule the country.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=19\u201321}} Venizelos followed in Theotokis' footsteps by continuing to re-arm and re-train the military, enacted extensive fortification and infrastructure works, purchased new weapons, and recalled the [[Military reserve force|reserve classes]] for training. The climax of this effort was the invitation in 1911 of a [[British naval mission to Greece (1911\u20131915)|British naval mission]] and a [[French military mission to Greece (1911\u20131914)|French military mission]].{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|pp=5\u20136}} \n\nAfter being informed of a Serbo-Bulgarian alliance, Venizelos ordered his ambassador in [[Sofia]] to prepare a Greco-Bulgarian defense agreement by 14 April 1912. Fearing that should Greece fail to participate in a future war against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], it would be unable to capture the Greek majority areas of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. The treaty was signed on 15 July 1912, with the two countries agreeing to assist each other in case of a defensive war and to safeguard the rights of Christian populations in Ottoman held Macedonia, thus joining the loose [[Balkan League]] alliance with [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Bulgaria]]. Fearing a new war in the Balkans, the Ottomans mobilized their armed forces on 14 September and began transferring units to [[Thrace]]; the Balkan League responded in kind.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=26\u201329}} On 30 September, the League presented the Ottomans with a list of demands regarding the rights of its Christian population. The Ottoman Empire rebuffed the demands, recalled its ambassadors in Sofia, Belgrade and Athens and expelled the League's negotiators on 4 October. The League's negotiators declared [[First Balkan War|war]] against the Ottomans, while Montenegro had already began military operations on 25 September.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=35\u201338}}\n\n==Prelude==\nGreece dispatched the [[Army of Epirus]] and the [[Army of Thessaly]] to its frontiers in [[Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]] respectively. The latter numbered 100,000 men, and was divided into seven divisions: namely the [[1st Infantry Division (Greece)|1st Infantry Division]], the [[2nd Infantry Division (Greece)|2nd Infantry Division]], the [[3rd Infantry Division (Greece)|3rd Infantry Division]], the [[4th Infantry Division (Greece)|4th Infantry Division]], the [[5th Infantry Division (Greece)|5th Infantry Division]], the [[6th Infantry Division (Greece)|6th Infantry Division]] and the [[7th Mechanized Infantry Brigade (Greece)|7th Infantry Division]], as well as a cavalry brigade and four independent [[Evzones]] battalions. The Army of Thessaly was commanded by Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]].{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|pp=289\u2013290}} Facing the Greeks in Thessaly was the Ottoman [[VIII Corps (Ottoman Empire)|VIII Corps]] under General [[Hasan Tahsin Pasha]] which included three divisions: the regular (''nizamiye'') [[22nd Infantry Division (Ottoman Empire)|22nd Division]] and the reserve (''redif'') Nasli\u00e7 and Ayd\u0131n Divisions{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=170}} which, combined with the Ottoman garrisons in western Macedonia, totaled 35,000-40,000 men.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nThe Army of Thessaly crossed into Ottoman territory in the early morning hours of 5 October, finding most border posts to be abandoned, with the garrisons at Melouna Pass, Profitis Ilias and Tsouka resisting for several hours before retreating. The first major clashes took place the following day when the 1st and 2nd Greek Divisions attacked hastily organized defenses north of [[Elassona]]. Elassona was defended by three infantry battalions, two artillery batteries and half a squadron of cavalry.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}} The battle for Elassona lasted for three hours, with the Ottomans retreating to avoid encirclement, thus giving the troops manning the main defensive line at Sarandaporo additional time to reinforce their positions.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=44\u201345}} The Greeks went on to advance {{convert|20|km|miles}} into the Elassona plateau without encountering any resistance.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=47}} Between 7 and 8 October, Greek troops regrouped in front of Sarandaporo and dispatched cavalry reconnaissance patrols towards the Ottoman positions, locating the headquarters of the Ottoman VIII Provisional Corps at Hania Viglas and those of a reserve division at Glikovo.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nSituated between the Vigla and Amorves mountains, Sarandaporo was a narrow mountain pass, the only one connecting Thessaly with central Macedonia; it spanned some {{convert|7-8|km|miles|sigfig=1}}. Having ceded Thessaly to Greece in the [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)]], the Ottomans began methodically reinforcing their positions around Sarandaporo in anticipation of a future war.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=48}} The Ottomans had organized their defenses under the guidance of German military advisors, placing their artillery batteries and infantry in sheltered, camouflaged trenches on the ravine's steep slopes, allowing them to accurately fire along its entire length. Considered to be nearly impenetrable it was dubbed \"the graveyard of the Greek Army\" by  the Prussian Field Marshal [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=42}}\n\n==Battle==\nAt 7 a.m. on 9 October, the Greek infantry began its assault on Sarandaporo. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Divisions attacked the Ottoman main line frontally, their advance hampered by accurate Ottoman rifle and artillery fire and the ruggedness of the terrain. In the meantime, the 4th Division conducted a flanking maneuver from the west with the intention of occupying the Porta Pass, and striking the rear of the Ottoman positions.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The 5th Division advanced further to the west towards the village of Zampourda which was situated on the other bank of the [[Haliacmon]], with the intention of protecting the left flank of the Greek forces emerging from the Sarandaporo pass. The cavalry brigade moved on the extreme west along the road towards [[Servia, Greece|Servia]], planning to block the bridge across the Haliacmon.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=51}} Attacking from the east of the pass the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment overcame stiff resistance at Vlacholeivado and captured the village, but failing to advance further due to heavy fog.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=207\u2013209}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} At 2 p.m., the main bulk of the Greek artillery was brought to the main line, joining the engagement. Despite suffering heavy casualties, the three divisions had halted some {{convert|500-700|m|yards|sigfig=1}} from the Ottoman trenches intending to launch a final assault the following morning.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}}\n\nThe 4th Division fought its way through the villages of Metaxas and Rachovo. Upon reaching the Porta Pass it engaged in a sanguinary clash with the defenders, securing its objective at 5 p.m.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=53}} The 5th Division and the Gennadis Evzone detachment were confronted by four Ottoman reserve battalions at Lazarades which held their ground until sunset.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The commander of the cavalry brigade ordered his unit to encamp at Loudani, refusing to advance further because of the resistance offered by the Ottomans at Lazarades. Fearing that they would be encircled by the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment, the Ottomans began to withdraw at 7 p.m., towards their second defensive line at Hani 739, under the cover of the night. Before retreating they fired a 20-minute artillery barrage on Greek positions along the entire frontline.

It was the first major battle fought between [[Kingdom of Greece|Greek]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces during the [[First Balkan War]], and revolved around the Sarandaporo pass, which connected [[Thessaly]] with central [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].\n\nDespite being perceived as impregnable by its defenders, the main body of the Greek forces managed to advance deep inside the pass, while auxiliary units broke through the Ottoman flanks. The Ottomans abandoned their defensive line during the night, fearing encirclement. The Greek victory at Sarandaporo opened the way for the capture of [[Servia, Greece|Servia]] and [[Kozani]].\n\n==Background==\nThe disastrous Greek defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]] of 1897 exposed major flaws in the [[Greek Army]]'s organization, training and logistics. Upon his appointment in December 1905, [[Georgios Theotokis]] became the first post-war Greek prime minister to focus his attention on strengthening the army. He established the National Defense Fund which financed the purchase of large quantities of ammunition. In addition a new [[table of organization]] was introduced for the country's [[Greek Navy|navy]] and army, the latter being augmented by numerous artillery batteries. Theotokis' resignation in January 1909 and the perceived neglect of the armed forces by his successor resulted in the [[Goudi coup]] seven months later. Rather than taking power for themselves, the putschists invited Cretan politician [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] to rule the country.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=19\u201321}} Venizelos followed in Theotokis' footsteps by continuing to re-arm and re-train the military, enacted extensive fortification and infrastructure works, purchased new weapons, and recalled the [[Military reserve force|reserve classes]] for training. The climax of this effort was the invitation in 1911 of a [[British naval mission to Greece (1911\u20131915)|British naval mission]] and a [[French military mission to Greece (1911\u20131914)|French military mission]].{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|pp=5\u20136}} \n\nAfter being informed of a Serbo-Bulgarian alliance, Venizelos ordered his ambassador in [[Sofia]] to prepare a Greco-Bulgarian defense agreement by 14 April 1912. Fearing that should Greece fail to participate in a future war against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], it would be unable to capture the Greek majority areas of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. The treaty was signed on 15 July 1912, with the two countries agreeing to assist each other in case of a defensive war and to safeguard the rights of Christian populations in Ottoman held Macedonia, thus joining the loose [[Balkan League]] alliance with [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Bulgaria]]. Fearing a new war in the Balkans, the Ottomans mobilized their armed forces on 14 September and began transferring units to [[Thrace]]; the Balkan League responded in kind.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=26\u201329}} On 30 September, the League presented the Ottomans with a list of demands regarding the rights of its Christian population. The Ottoman Empire rebuffed the demands, recalled its ambassadors in Sofia, Belgrade and Athens and expelled the League's negotiators on 4 October. The League's negotiators declared [[First Balkan War|war]] against the Ottomans, while Montenegro had already began military operations on 25 September.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=35\u201338}}\n\n==Prelude==\nGreece dispatched the [[Army of Epirus]] and the [[Army of Thessaly]] to its frontiers in [[Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]] respectively. The latter numbered 100,000 men, and was divided into seven divisions: namely the [[1st Infantry Division (Greece)|1st Infantry Division]], the [[2nd Infantry Division (Greece)|2nd Infantry Division]], the [[3rd Infantry Division (Greece)|3rd Infantry Division]], the [[4th Infantry Division (Greece)|4th Infantry Division]], the [[5th Infantry Division (Greece)|5th Infantry Division]], the [[6th Infantry Division (Greece)|6th Infantry Division]] and the [[7th Mechanized Infantry Brigade (Greece)|7th Infantry Division]], as well as a cavalry brigade and four independent [[Evzones]] battalions. The Army of Thessaly was commanded by Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]].{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|pp=289\u2013290}} Facing the Greeks in Thessaly was the Ottoman [[VIII Corps (Ottoman Empire)|VIII Corps]] under General [[Hasan Tahsin Pasha]] which included three divisions: the regular (''nizamiye'') [[22nd Infantry Division (Ottoman Empire)|22nd Division]] and the reserve (''redif'') Nasli\u00e7 and Ayd\u0131n Divisions{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=170}} which, combined with the Ottoman garrisons in western Macedonia, totaled 35,000-40,000 men.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nThe Army of Thessaly crossed into Ottoman territory in the early morning hours of 5 October, finding most border posts to be abandoned, with the garrisons at Melouna Pass, Profitis Ilias and Tsouka resisting for several hours before retreating. The first major clashes took place the following day when the 1st and 2nd Greek Divisions attacked hastily organized defenses north of [[Elassona]]. Elassona was defended by three infantry battalions, two artillery batteries and half a squadron of cavalry.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}} The battle for Elassona lasted for three hours, with the Ottomans retreating to avoid encirclement, thus giving the troops manning the main defensive line at Sarandaporo additional time to reinforce their positions.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=44\u201345}} The Greeks went on to advance {{convert|20|km|miles}} into the Elassona plateau without encountering any resistance.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=47}} Between 7 and 8 October, Greek troops regrouped in front of Sarandaporo and dispatched cavalry reconnaissance patrols towards the Ottoman positions, locating the headquarters of the Ottoman VIII Provisional Corps at Hania Viglas and those of a reserve division at Glikovo.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nSituated between the Vigla and Amorves mountains, Sarandaporo was a narrow mountain pass, the only one connecting Thessaly with central Macedonia; it spanned some {{convert|7-8|km|miles|sigfig=1}}. Having ceded Thessaly to Greece in the [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)]], the Ottomans began methodically reinforcing their positions around Sarandaporo in anticipation of a future war.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=48}} The Ottomans had organized their defenses under the guidance of German military advisors, placing their artillery batteries and infantry in sheltered, camouflaged trenches on the ravine's steep slopes, allowing them to accurately fire along its entire length. Considered to be nearly impenetrable it was dubbed \"the graveyard of the Greek Army\" by  the Prussian Field Marshal [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=42}}\n\n==Battle==\nAt 7 a.m. on 9 October, the Greek infantry began its assault on Sarandaporo. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Divisions attacked the Ottoman main line frontally, their advance hampered by accurate Ottoman rifle and artillery fire and the ruggedness of the terrain. In the meantime, the 4th Division conducted a flanking maneuver from the west with the intention of occupying the Porta Pass, and striking the rear of the Ottoman positions.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The 5th Division advanced further to the west towards the village of Zampourda which was situated on the other bank of the [[Haliacmon]], with the intention of protecting the left flank of the Greek forces emerging from the Sarandaporo pass. The cavalry brigade moved on the extreme west along the road towards [[Servia, Greece|Servia]], planning to block the bridge across the Haliacmon.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=51}} Attacking from the east of the pass the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment overcame stiff resistance at Vlacholeivado and captured the village, but failing to advance further due to heavy fog.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=207\u2013209}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} At 2 p.m., the main bulk of the Greek artillery was brought to the main line, joining the engagement. Despite suffering heavy casualties, the three divisions had halted some {{convert|500-700|m|yards|sigfig=1}} from the Ottoman trenches intending to launch a final assault the following morning.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}}\n\nThe 4th Division fought its way through the villages of Metaxas and Rachovo. Upon reaching the Porta Pass it engaged in a sanguinary clash with the defenders, securing its objective at 5 p.m.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=53}} The 5th Division and the Gennadis Evzone detachment were confronted by four Ottoman reserve battalions at Lazarades which held their ground until sunset.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The commander of the cavalry brigade ordered his unit to encamp at Loudani, refusing to advance further because of the resistance offered by the Ottomans at Lazarades. Fearing that they would be encircled by the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment, the Ottomans began to withdraw at 7 p.m., towards their second defensive line at Hani 739, under the cover of the night. Before retreating they fired a 20-minute artillery barrage on Greek positions along the entire frontline. Unaware of the Ottoman retreat the Greeks failed to use the opportunity and cut their access to the bridge across the Haliacmon. Upon reaching their second defensive line, the Ottomans became aware of the 4th Divisions' seizure of Porta Pass, panic spread in their ranks and many soldiers fled, abandoning their equipment.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=203\u2013205}} On the morning of 10 October, the 4th Division charged down the northern slope of the Rahovo Mountain, surprising the Ottoman infantry and artillerymen who abandoned over twenty [[Krupp gun]]s and engaged in a disorganized retreat.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}} The Greek cavalry's indecision once again enabled the fleeing Ottomans to safely reach Servia and [[Kozani]].{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=56\u201357}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nAt 4 p.m. on 10 October, the 4th Division entered Servia, witnessing 75 to 90 severed human heads lined up on either side of one of its streets.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} Following the declaration of war local authorities had detained all the Christian dignitaries from Servia and the surrounding villages with the intention of massacring them, a plan that was thwarted by Ottoman officer Omer Bey.

He reigned for 38 years from 1460 to 1497; his era was eulogized as the ''Prospered reign of H\u1ed3ng \u0110\u1ee9c'' (\u6d2a\u5fb7\u4e4b\u76db\u6cbb).\n==Biography==\nL\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng has a [[real name]] '''L\u00ea H\u1ea1o''' (\u9ece\u705d), [[courtesy name]] '''T\u01b0 Th\u00e0nh''' (\u601d\u8aa0), [[pseudonym]] '''\u0110\u1ea1o Am ch\u1ee7 nh\u00e2n''' (\u9053\u5eb5\u4e3b\u4eba), [[rhymed name]] '''Tao \u0110\u00e0n nguy\u00ean s\u00fay''' (\u9a37\u58c7\u5143\u5e25), [[formal title]] '''Thi\u00ean Nam \u0111\u1ed9ng ch\u1ee7''' (\u5929\u5357\u6d1e\u4e3b), was the son of emperor [[L\u00ea Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng]] and his consort [[Ng\u00f4 Th\u1ecb B\u00ednh|Ng\u00f4 Th\u1ecb Ng\u1ecdc Dao]]. He was a half-brother of [[L\u00ea Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng]] and it is likely that his mother and consort [[Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Anh]] (the mother of [[L\u00ea Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng]]) were related (cousins or perhaps sisters). He was educated just like his half brother, the emperor, at the palace in [[Hanoi]]. When his elder half brother, Nghi D\u00e2n, staged a coup and killed the emperor in 1459, Prince T\u01b0 Th\u00e0nh was spared. Nine months later, when the second counter-coup was successfully carried out, the plotters asked Prince T\u01b0 Th\u00e0nh to become the new emperor and he accepted.\n\nThe leaders of the counter-coup which removed and killed Nghi D\u00e2n were two of the last surviving friends and aides of [[L\u00ea L\u1ee3i]]- [[Nguy\u1ec5n X\u00ed]]  and [[\u0110inh Li\u1ec7t]] . The pair had been out of power since the 1440s, but they still commanded respect due to their association with the dynasty's founder, [[L\u00ea L\u1ee3i]]. The new emperor appointed these men to the highest positions in his new government-          became one of the emperor's councilors [[Nguy\u1ec5n X\u00ed]]  and \u0110inh Li\u1ec7t was gifted command over the army of [[Name of Vietnam|Vi\u1ec7t Nam]].\n\n===The idea of rule===\nL\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng created and widely distributed a new legal code- also called 'H\u1ed3ng \u0110\u1ee9c'. The new laws were <blockquote> \"based on Chinese law but included distinctly Vietnamese features, such as recognition of the higher position of women in Vietnamese society than in Chinese society. Under the new code, parental consent was not required for marriage, and daughters were granted equal inheritance rights with sons.  [http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/11.htm U.S. Library of Congress Country Studies \u2013 Vietnam]</blockquote>\n\nA group of 28 poets was formally recognized by the court (the Tao Dan) and a new official history of Vietnam was written called ''[[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t s\u1eed k\u00fd to\u00e0n th\u01b0]]'' (The Full History of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t, \u5927\u8d8a\u53f2\u8a18\u5168\u66f8). The historian [[Ng\u00f4 S\u0129 Li\u00ean]] compiled this in 1479<ref>Keith Weller Taylor: ''The Birth of Vietnam''. Revision of thesis (Ph.D.). Appendix O, page 355. University of California Press (1991). {{ISBN|0-520-07417-3}}</ref> and it was published under supervision of the emperor.\n\nAs a young prince he was given the best Confucian education; his teacher was Tran Phong who later wrote about how serious a student Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng had been. He went about implementing Confucian principals in his government and seeing that the land was in Confucian harmony through the invocation of various rituals.\n\nThe emperor toured the entire country in 1467, addressing local problems that he found, firing government officials that he found to be corrupt, and re-distributing land that had been illegally taken. This made him very popular with the people and increased his base of support among them.\n\nHe also wrote poetry, some of which has survived. He wrote the following at the start of his campaign against the Champa:\n<blockquote>\nOne hundred thousand officers and men, <br>\nStart out on a distant journey. <br>\nFalling on the sails, the rain <br>\nSoftens the sounds of the army.</blockquote>\n\nL\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng tried to be and essentially succeeded in becoming the ideal Confucian ruler; he was deeply concerned with maintaining a good government and keeping personal morality.\n\n===The rise of Confucianism===\nTh\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng was strongly influenced by his Confucian teachers and he resolved to make [[Name of Vietnam|Vi\u1ec7t Nam]] more like the former [[Song Dynasty]] with its [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucianist]] philosophy and the key idea that the government should be run by men of noble character as opposed to men from noble families. This meant that he needed to take power away from the ruling families (mostly from [[Thanh H\u00f3a Province|Thanh H\u00f3a province]]) and give power to the scholars who did well on the official examinations. The first step on this path was to revive the examination process, which had continued sporadically in the 1450s. The first examination was held in 1463 and, as expected, the top scholars were men from elsewhere- usually from the river delta surrounding the capital, not from [[Thanh H\u00f3a]].\n\nTh\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng encouraged the spread of Confucian values throughout Vietnam by having \"[[Temple of Confucius|temples of literature]]\" built in all the provinces. There, Confucius was venerated and classic works on Confucianism could be found. He also halted the building of any new Buddhist or Taoist temples and ordered that monks were not to be allowed to purchase any new land.\n\nFollowing the Chinese model, L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng divided the government into six ministries; they were Finance, Rites, Justice, Personnel, Army, and Public Works. Nine grades of rank were set up for both the civil administration and the military. A Board of Censors was set up with royal authority to monitor governmental officials and reported exclusively to the emperor. However, governmental authority did not extend all the way to the village level. The villages were ruled by their own councils in Vietnam (''Vietnam, Trials and Tribulations of a Nation'' D. R. SarDesai, ppg 35\u201337, 1988).\n\nWith the death of [[Nguy\u1ec5n X\u00ed]]  in 1465, the noble families from Thanh H\u00f3a province lost their leader. Soon they were mostly relegated to secondary positions in the new Confucian government of Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng. However, they still retained control over Vietnam's armies as the old general, \u0110inh Li\u1ec7t, was still in command of the army.\n\nIn 1469, all of Vietnam was mapped and a full census was taken, listing all the villages in the kingdom. Around this time the country was divided into 13 dao (provinces). Each was administrated by a Governor, Judge, and the local army commander. The emperor Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng also ordered that a new census should be taken every six years. Other public works that were undertaken included building and repair of granaries, using the army to rebuild and repair irrigation systems after floods, and sending out doctors to areas afflicted by outbreaks of disease. Also in 1469, Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng's reign name was chosen- '''Great Virtue''' (H\u1ed3ng \u0110\u1ee9c). Even though the emperor, at 25, was relatively young, he had already restored Vietnam's stability, which was a marked contrast from the turbulent times marking the reigns of the two emperors before him.\n\nThe new government proved to be effective and represented a successful adaptation of the Chinese Confucian system of government outside of China.\n\n===Relations with the Ming dynasty===\nL\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng was aggressive in his relations with foreign countries including China and Malacca and cracked down on foreign trade and contacts, enforcing an isolationist policy.\n\nSeveral Malay envoys from the [[Malacca sultanate]] were attacked and captured in 1469 by [[Name of Vietnam|Vi\u1ec7t Nam]] as they were returning to Malacca from China.

This was dealt with by sending additional forces to the north to fight the pirates. Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng also sent a military force to the west to subdue the Ai-lao mountain tribe that was raiding the northern border.\n\nIn 1470, the Vietnamese began preparing for a crucial war against Champa to the south. The war was ignited by [[P'an-Lo T'ou-Ts'iuan|Tra-Toan]], who led a Cham army into the southern extremities of Vietnam. L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng responded with a swift counterattack; Vietnamese armies were mobilized from all over the country, and in keeping with tradition, an envoy was sent to Beijing explaining the motives of the offensive. On 6 November 1470, he ordered generals \u0110inh Li\u1ec7t and L\u00ea Niem to lead a vanguard of 100,000 men south into Champa. On 16 November 1470, L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng personally led the main army of 150,000 and marched south.  On December 18, the first Vietnamese soldiers entered Champa territory.<ref name=Maspero>Maspero, G., 2002, The Champa Kingdom, Bangkok: White Lotus Co., Ltd., {{ISBN|9747534991}}</ref>{{rp|117}}\n\nOn February 5, Champa king [[P'an-Lo T'ou-Ts'iuan|Tra-Toan]] ordered his brother to lead six generals and 5,000 men and elephants to secretly approach L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng's army. The Vietnamese forces discovered this plan so a force of 30,000 commanded by generals Le Hy Cat, Hoang Nhan Thiem, Le The, and Tr\u1ecbnh Van Sai attacked the enemy's rear from the sea. At the same time, an army commanded by Nguyen Duc Trung ambushed the Champa army and forced it to withdraw. This army was then completely wiped out by Le Hy Cat's troops.\n\nOn 27 February, L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng personally led the troops to capture Thi Nai, the most important harbor of Champa.\n\nOn 29 February, the Vietnamese army surrounded the Champa capital city of [[Vijaya (Champa)|Vijaya]] (near modern-day [[Qui Nh\u01a1n]]). The city was captured, and the Cham king, Tra-Toan, was taken captive. He died on the return journey to Thang Long. Cham losses were immense, with some 60,000 dead and 30,000 enslaved. The Champa regions of Amaravati and Vijaya were formally annexed to the Vietnamese kingdom as the newly organized province of Quang-nam.<ref name=Maspero/>{{rp|118}}\n\nThe Vietnamese army continued marching south until it reached C\u1ea3 pass \u2013 some 50 miles north of the Champa city of Kauthara (modern-day [[Nha Trang]]).\n\nThe conquest of the Cham kingdoms started a rapid period of expansion by the Vietnamese southwards into this newly conquered land. The government used a system of land settlement called ''\u0111\u1ed3n \u0111i\u1ec1n'' ([[wikt:\u5c6f|\u5c6f]][[wikt:\u7530|\u7530]]). <blockquote> Under this system, military colonies were established in which soldiers and landless peasants cleared new areas, began rice production on the new lands, established villages and served as a militia to defend them. After three years, the villages would be incorporated into the Vietnamese administrative system. A communal village meeting house (dinh) would be built, and the workers were given an opportunity to share in the communal lands given by the state to each village. The remainder of the land belonged to the state. As each area was cleared and a village established, the soldiers of the don dien would move on to clear more land.

A powerful Vietnamese army invaded the Lao lands, sacking the capital city of Luang Phrab\u0101ng (''Vietnam, Trials and Tribulations of a Nation'' D. R. SarDesai, pg 35, 1988), despite an eventual Lao counteroffensive which repulsed the Vietnamese. Dai Viet would intervene at least once more in Laos during the rule of [[Tr\u1ecbnh C\u0103n]] in 1694. As a result of this war, the modern-day provinces of [[Lai Ch\u00e2u Province|Lai Ch\u00e2u]] and [[\u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Province|\u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean]] were annexed by \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t from Lan Xang, and are still part of Vietnam today.\n\n== Family ==\n* Father: [[L\u00ea Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng]]\n* Mother: Empress Quang Thuc [[Ngo Thi Ngoc Dao]] (\u5149\u6dd1\u6587\u7687\u540e\u5433\u6c0f; 1421 - 1496)\n* Consort(s) and their Respective Issue(s):\n# Empress Huy Gia (Empress Truong Lac) [[Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb H\u1eb1ng]] of Nguyen Clan (\u5fbd\u5609\u7687\u540e\u962e\u6c0f; 1441 - 1505)\n## Crown Prince Le Tranh, so Emperor [[L\u00ea Hi\u1ebfn T\u00f4ng]]\n# Empress Nhu Huy of Phung clan (\u67d4\u5fbd\u7687\u540e\u99ae\u6c0f; 1444 - 1489)\n## Prince Le Tan, father of Emperor [[L\u00ea T\u01b0\u01a1ng D\u1ef1c]]\n# Imperial Consort Minh of Pham clan (\u660e\u5983\u8303\u6c0f; 1448 - 1498)\n## Prince Le Tung\n## Princess Loi Y L\u00ea O\u00e1nh Ng\u1ecdc (\u96f7\u61ff\u516c\u4e3b\u9ece\u83b9\u7389)\n## Princess Lan Minh L\u00ea Lan Khu\u00ea (\u5170\u660e\u516c\u4e3b\u9ece\u5170\u572d; 1470 - 14??)\n# Imperial Consort Kinh of Nguyen clan  (\u656c\u5983\u962e\u6c0f; 1444 - 1485)\n## Princess Minh Kinh L\u00ea Th\u1ee5y Hoa (\u660e\u656c\u516c\u4e3b\u9ece\u745e\u534e)\n# Consort Nguyen thi (\u8cb4\u5983\u962e\u6c0f)\n## Prince Le Thoan\n# Lady Nguyen (\u4fee\u5bb9\u962e\u6c0f)\n# Lady Nguyen (\u624d\u4eba\u962e\u6c0f; 1444 - 1479)\n## Prince Le Tranh\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category|L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng}}\n* [[List of Vietnamese monarchs]]\n* [[L\u00ea Dynasty]]\n==References==\n{{reflist|4}}\n*The first part of this history is based on the doctoral thesis of John K.

He reigned for 38 years from 1460 to 1497; his era was eulogized as the ''Prospered reign of H\u1ed3ng \u0110\u1ee9c'' (\u6d2a\u5fb7\u4e4b\u76db\u6cbb).\n==Biography==\nL\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng has a [[real name]] '''L\u00ea H\u1ea1o''' (\u9ece\u705d), [[courtesy name]] '''T\u01b0 Th\u00e0nh''' (\u601d\u8aa0), [[pseudonym]] '''\u0110\u1ea1o Am ch\u1ee7 nh\u00e2n''' (\u9053\u5eb5\u4e3b\u4eba), [[rhymed name]] '''Tao \u0110\u00e0n nguy\u00ean s\u00fay''' (\u9a37\u58c7\u5143\u5e25), [[formal title]] '''Thi\u00ean Nam \u0111\u1ed9ng ch\u1ee7''' (\u5929\u5357\u6d1e\u4e3b), was the son of emperor [[L\u00ea Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng]] and his consort [[Ng\u00f4 Th\u1ecb B\u00ednh|Ng\u00f4 Th\u1ecb Ng\u1ecdc Dao]]. He was a half-brother of [[L\u00ea Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng]] and it is likely that his mother and consort [[Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Anh]] (the mother of [[L\u00ea Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng]]) were related (cousins or perhaps sisters). He was educated just like his half brother, the emperor, at the palace in [[Hanoi]]. When his elder half brother, Nghi D\u00e2n, staged a coup and killed the emperor in 1459, Prince T\u01b0 Th\u00e0nh was spared. Nine months later, when the second counter-coup was successfully carried out, the plotters asked Prince T\u01b0 Th\u00e0nh to become the new emperor and he accepted.\n\nThe leaders of the counter-coup which removed and killed Nghi D\u00e2n were two of the last surviving friends and aides of [[L\u00ea L\u1ee3i]]- [[Nguy\u1ec5n X\u00ed]]  and [[\u0110inh Li\u1ec7t]] . The pair had been out of power since the 1440s, but they still commanded respect due to their association with the dynasty's founder, [[L\u00ea L\u1ee3i]]. The new emperor appointed these men to the highest positions in his new government-          became one of the emperor's councilors [[Nguy\u1ec5n X\u00ed]]  and \u0110inh Li\u1ec7t was gifted command over the army of [[Name of Vietnam|Vi\u1ec7t Nam]].\n\n===The idea of rule===\nL\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng created and widely distributed a new legal code- also called 'H\u1ed3ng \u0110\u1ee9c'. The new laws were <blockquote> \"based on Chinese law but included distinctly Vietnamese features, such as recognition of the higher position of women in Vietnamese society than in Chinese society. Under the new code, parental consent was not required for marriage, and daughters were granted equal inheritance rights with sons.  [http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/11.htm U.S. Library of Congress Country Studies \u2013 Vietnam]</blockquote>\n\nA group of 28 poets was formally recognized by the court (the Tao Dan) and a new official history of Vietnam was written called ''[[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t s\u1eed k\u00fd to\u00e0n th\u01b0]]'' (The Full History of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t, \u5927\u8d8a\u53f2\u8a18\u5168\u66f8). The historian [[Ng\u00f4 S\u0129 Li\u00ean]] compiled this in 1479<ref>Keith Weller Taylor: ''The Birth of Vietnam''. Revision of thesis (Ph.D.). Appendix O, page 355. University of California Press (1991). {{ISBN|0-520-07417-3}}</ref> and it was published under supervision of the emperor.\n\nAs a young prince he was given the best Confucian education; his teacher was Tran Phong who later wrote about how serious a student Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng had been. He went about implementing Confucian principals in his government and seeing that the land was in Confucian harmony through the invocation of various rituals.\n\nThe emperor toured the entire country in 1467, addressing local problems that he found, firing government officials that he found to be corrupt, and re-distributing land that had been illegally taken. This made him very popular with the people and increased his base of support among them.\n\nHe also wrote poetry, some of which has survived. He wrote the following at the start of his campaign against the Champa:\n<blockquote>\nOne hundred thousand officers and men, <br>\nStart out on a distant journey. <br>\nFalling on the sails, the rain <br>\nSoftens the sounds of the army.</blockquote>\n\nL\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng tried to be and essentially succeeded in becoming the ideal Confucian ruler; he was deeply concerned with maintaining a good government and keeping personal morality.\n\n===The rise of Confucianism===\nTh\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng was strongly influenced by his Confucian teachers and he resolved to make [[Name of Vietnam|Vi\u1ec7t Nam]] more like the former [[Song Dynasty]] with its [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucianist]] philosophy and the key idea that the government should be run by men of noble character as opposed to men from noble families. This meant that he needed to take power away from the ruling families (mostly from [[Thanh H\u00f3a Province|Thanh H\u00f3a province]]) and give power to the scholars who did well on the official examinations. The first step on this path was to revive the examination process, which had continued sporadically in the 1450s. The first examination was held in 1463 and, as expected, the top scholars were men from elsewhere- usually from the river delta surrounding the capital, not from [[Thanh H\u00f3a]].\n\nTh\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng encouraged the spread of Confucian values throughout Vietnam by having \"[[Temple of Confucius|temples of literature]]\" built in all the provinces. There, Confucius was venerated and classic works on Confucianism could be found. He also halted the building of any new Buddhist or Taoist temples and ordered that monks were not to be allowed to purchase any new land.\n\nFollowing the Chinese model, L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng divided the government into six ministries; they were Finance, Rites, Justice, Personnel, Army, and Public Works. Nine grades of rank were set up for both the civil administration and the military. A Board of Censors was set up with royal authority to monitor governmental officials and reported exclusively to the emperor. However, governmental authority did not extend all the way to the village level. The villages were ruled by their own councils in Vietnam (''Vietnam, Trials and Tribulations of a Nation'' D. R. SarDesai, ppg 35\u201337, 1988).\n\nWith the death of [[Nguy\u1ec5n X\u00ed]]  in 1465, the noble families from Thanh H\u00f3a province lost their leader. Soon they were mostly relegated to secondary positions in the new Confucian government of Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng. However, they still retained control over Vietnam's armies as the old general, \u0110inh Li\u1ec7t, was still in command of the army.\n\nIn 1469, all of Vietnam was mapped and a full census was taken, listing all the villages in the kingdom. Around this time the country was divided into 13 dao (provinces). Each was administrated by a Governor, Judge, and the local army commander. The emperor Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng also ordered that a new census should be taken every six years. Other public works that were undertaken included building and repair of granaries, using the army to rebuild and repair irrigation systems after floods, and sending out doctors to areas afflicted by outbreaks of disease. Also in 1469, Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng's reign name was chosen- '''Great Virtue''' (H\u1ed3ng \u0110\u1ee9c). Even though the emperor, at 25, was relatively young, he had already restored Vietnam's stability, which was a marked contrast from the turbulent times marking the reigns of the two emperors before him.\n\nThe new government proved to be effective and represented a successful adaptation of the Chinese Confucian system of government outside of China.\n\n===Relations with the Ming dynasty===\nL\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng was aggressive in his relations with foreign countries including China and Malacca and cracked down on foreign trade and contacts, enforcing an isolationist policy.\n\nSeveral Malay envoys from the [[Malacca sultanate]] were attacked and captured in 1469 by [[Name of Vietnam|Vi\u1ec7t Nam]] as they were returning to Malacca from China. The Vietnamese enslaved and castrated the young from among the captured.<ref>Tsai (1996), p. 15  {{Google books|Ka6jNJcX_ygC|The Eunuchs in the Ming Dynasty (Ming Tai Huan Kuan)|page=15}}</ref><ref>Rost (1887), p. 252  {{Google books|TgkYAAAAYAAJ|Miscellaneous papers relating to Indo-China: reprinted for the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society from Dalrymple's \"Oriental Repertory,\" and the \"Asiatic Researches\" and \"Journal\" of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Volume 1|page=252}}</ref><ref>Rost (1887), p. 252 {{Google books|utZMAAAAYAAJ|Miscellaneous papers relating to Indo-China and Indian archipelage: reprinted for the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society.

Twelve of them were enslaved to work as agricultural laborers, while the youngest, [[Wu Rui (eunuch)|Wu Rui]] (\u5433\u745e) was selected for castration since he was the only young man and he became a eunuch at the [[Imperial Citadel of Thang Long|Vietnamese imperial palace in Thang Long]].

A soldier told him of an escape route back to China and Wu Rui escaped to [[Longzhou County|Longzhou]].

This was dealt with by sending additional forces to the north to fight the pirates. Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng also sent a military force to the west to subdue the Ai-lao mountain tribe that was raiding the northern border.\n\nIn 1470, the Vietnamese began preparing for a crucial war against Champa to the south. The war was ignited by [[P'an-Lo T'ou-Ts'iuan|Tra-Toan]], who led a Cham army into the southern extremities of Vietnam. L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng responded with a swift counterattack; Vietnamese armies were mobilized from all over the country, and in keeping with tradition, an envoy was sent to Beijing explaining the motives of the offensive. On 6 November 1470, he ordered generals \u0110inh Li\u1ec7t and L\u00ea Niem to lead a vanguard of 100,000 men south into Champa. On 16 November 1470, L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng personally led the main army of 150,000 and marched south.  On December 18, the first Vietnamese soldiers entered Champa territory.<ref name=Maspero>Maspero, G., 2002, The Champa Kingdom, Bangkok: White Lotus Co., Ltd., {{ISBN|9747534991}}</ref>{{rp|117}}\n\nOn February 5, Champa king [[P'an-Lo T'ou-Ts'iuan|Tra-Toan]] ordered his brother to lead six generals and 5,000 men and elephants to secretly approach L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng's army. The Vietnamese forces discovered this plan so a force of 30,000 commanded by generals Le Hy Cat, Hoang Nhan Thiem, Le The, and Tr\u1ecbnh Van Sai attacked the enemy's rear from the sea. At the same time, an army commanded by Nguyen Duc Trung ambushed the Champa army and forced it to withdraw. This army was then completely wiped out by Le Hy Cat's troops.\n\nOn 27 February, L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng personally led the troops to capture Thi Nai, the most important harbor of Champa.\n\nOn 29 February, the Vietnamese army surrounded the Champa capital city of [[Vijaya (Champa)|Vijaya]] (near modern-day [[Qui Nh\u01a1n]]). The city was captured, and the Cham king, Tra-Toan, was taken captive. He died on the return journey to Thang Long. Cham losses were immense, with some 60,000 dead and 30,000 enslaved. The Champa regions of Amaravati and Vijaya were formally annexed to the Vietnamese kingdom as the newly organized province of Quang-nam.<ref name=Maspero/>{{rp|118}}\n\nThe Vietnamese army continued marching south until it reached C\u1ea3 pass \u2013 some 50 miles north of the Champa city of Kauthara (modern-day [[Nha Trang]]).\n\nThe conquest of the Cham kingdoms started a rapid period of expansion by the Vietnamese southwards into this newly conquered land. The government used a system of land settlement called ''\u0111\u1ed3n \u0111i\u1ec1n'' ([[wikt:\u5c6f|\u5c6f]][[wikt:\u7530|\u7530]]). <blockquote> Under this system, military colonies were established in which soldiers and landless peasants cleared new areas, began rice production on the new lands, established villages and served as a militia to defend them. After three years, the villages would be incorporated into the Vietnamese administrative system. A communal village meeting house (dinh) would be built, and the workers were given an opportunity to share in the communal lands given by the state to each village. The remainder of the land belonged to the state. As each area was cleared and a village established, the soldiers of the don dien would move on to clear more land.

Fox took office vowing to clear up several high-profile murders. Deputy Attorney General [[Mar\u00eda de la Luz Lima Malvido]] cited serious irregularities in earlier probes, including police obstruction and the disappearance of over 1,000 key documents.

[[Evans Brothers]])]]\n'''''The Dam Busters''''' is a non-fiction book by [[Paul Brickhill]] about [[Royal Air Force]] [[No. 617 Squadron RAF|Squadron 617]]\nOriginally commanded by [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] [[Guy Gibson]] [[Victoria Cross|V.C.]] during [[World War II]]. The squadron became known as the \"Dam Busters\" because of [[Operation Chastise]], a mission using highly specialised bombs to destroy [[Ruhr Area|Ruhr]] dams in Germany.\n\nThe book also covers the subsequent history of [[No. 617 Squadron RAF|617 Squadron]], as an elite squadron specializing in attacking difficult targets with outsize weapons and precision techniques. Among Gibson's successors as commander was [[Group Captain]] [[Leonard Cheshire]] [[Victoria Cross|V.C.]], and the book describes Cheshire's unorthodox leadership style and innovative target marking techniques.\n\n==Development==\n\nAfter the end of World War II John Nerney, head of the Air Historical Branch of the British Air Ministry identified the need for a history of 617 Squadron. He initially approached its former commanding officer Leonard Cheshire, who declined citing health issues and his work commitments running a hospice.<ref name=Cooper>Cooper. Page 163.</ref>\n\nCheshire recommended that McGowan Cradon be considered for the task. Cradon had served as intelligence officer with the squadron. in December 1946 Cradon was approached and agreed but his services were rejected by the RAF as senior officers questioned his commitment since, during the war, he had been too interested in flying on practice flights rather than attending to his duties.<ref name=Cooper/>\n\nNerney then discussed the issue with John Pudney, who was an editor at News Review. Pudney had liked Paul Brickhill's book of World War II escape attempts ''Escape to Danger'' (which he had co-authored with Conrad Norton) and was at the time attempting to turn it into a series for BBC TV.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 196.</ref>\n\nFollowing up Pudney's recommendation, Nerney approached Brickhill in February 1949, who jumped at the offer. As an officer and a pilot in the RAF and a proven writer and journalist Brickhill was acceptable provided he could obtain written confirmation from the RAAF of his service with the RAF. Eventually this was received in March 1949.<ref name= Dando-CollinsP198>Dando-Collins. Page 198.</ref>\n\nWhile doing all it could to assist his research the Air Ministry could only provided Brickhill with a small honorarium, and no guarantee of publication other than as a government produced publication.<ref>Dando-Collins.

[[Evans Brothers]])]]\n'''''The Dam Busters''''' is a non-fiction book by [[Paul Brickhill]] about [[Royal Air Force]] [[No. 617 Squadron RAF|Squadron 617]]\nOriginally commanded by [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] [[Guy Gibson]] [[Victoria Cross|V.C.]] during [[World War II]]. The squadron became known as the \"Dam Busters\" because of [[Operation Chastise]], a mission using highly specialised bombs to destroy [[Ruhr Area|Ruhr]] dams in Germany.\n\nThe book also covers the subsequent history of [[No. 617 Squadron RAF|617 Squadron]], as an elite squadron specializing in attacking difficult targets with outsize weapons and precision techniques. Among Gibson's successors as commander was [[Group Captain]] [[Leonard Cheshire]] [[Victoria Cross|V.C.]], and the book describes Cheshire's unorthodox leadership style and innovative target marking techniques.\n\n==Development==\n\nAfter the end of World War II John Nerney, head of the Air Historical Branch of the British Air Ministry identified the need for a history of 617 Squadron. He initially approached its former commanding officer Leonard Cheshire, who declined citing health issues and his work commitments running a hospice.<ref name=Cooper>Cooper. Page 163.</ref>\n\nCheshire recommended that McGowan Cradon be considered for the task. Cradon had served as intelligence officer with the squadron. in December 1946 Cradon was approached and agreed but his services were rejected by the RAF as senior officers questioned his commitment since, during the war, he had been too interested in flying on practice flights rather than attending to his duties.<ref name=Cooper/>\n\nNerney then discussed the issue with John Pudney, who was an editor at News Review. Pudney had liked Paul Brickhill's book of World War II escape attempts ''Escape to Danger'' (which he had co-authored with Conrad Norton) and was at the time attempting to turn it into a series for BBC TV.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 196.</ref>\n\nFollowing up Pudney's recommendation, Nerney approached Brickhill in February 1949, who jumped at the offer. As an officer and a pilot in the RAF and a proven writer and journalist Brickhill was acceptable provided he could obtain written confirmation from the RAAF of his service with the RAF. Eventually this was received in March 1949.<ref name= Dando-CollinsP198>Dando-Collins. Page 198.</ref>\n\nWhile doing all it could to assist his research the Air Ministry could only provided Brickhill with a small honorarium, and no guarantee of publication other than as a government produced publication.<ref>Dando-Collins.
