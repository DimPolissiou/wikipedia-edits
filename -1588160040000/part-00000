These countries include Germany and Poland. In the United States the baby boom was attributed to the number of veterans returning home after the war ended in 1945. It also was due to the strong post-war American economy. The U.S. Congress passed the G.I. Bill of Rights to encourage home ownership and higher levels of education by charging very low or no interest at all on loans for veterans. Getting settled in with a more comfortable economic position allowed families to have a place to live, be educated, and start having babies. \"Now thriving on the American Dream, life was simple, jobs were plentiful, and a record number of babies were born.\"\n\nThe U.S. birthrate exploded after World War II. From 1941 to 1961, more than 65 million children were born in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.countriesquest.com/north_america/usa/people/growth_of_u_s_population/growth_through_natural_increase_births/birthrates_since_world_war_ii/baby_boom.htm|title=Baby Boom \u2013 Birthrates Since World War II \u2013 Growth through Natural Increase: Births \u2013 Growth of U.S. Population \u2013 People \u2013 USA \u2013 North America: tubal ligation, adult baby, birth control, security system, million baby|website=www.countriesquest.com|access-date=2017-06-14}}</ref> At the height of this baby boom, a child was born every seven seconds on average. Factors that contributed to the baby boom consisted of young couples who started families after putting off marriage during the War, government encouragement of growth of families through the aid of GI benefits, and popular culture that celebrated pregnancy, parenthood, and large families.\n\nThe baby boom was the result of couples holding off on having children due to the Great Depression and World War II. Once the baby boom began, the average woman started getting married around the age of 20 instead of 22. Couples were eager to have babies after the war ended because they knew that the world would be a safer place to start a family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-us-history/period-8/apush-postwar-era/a/the-baby-boom|title=The baby boom|website=Khan Academy|language=en|access-date=2017-06-14}}</ref>\n\nAnother leading cause that led to the baby boom was that people were able to afford moving out to the suburbs to raise a family instead of living in the city. Additionally, the cost of living in the suburbs was very low, especially for those returning from the military. This was also the time period where women were encouraged to take on their \"[[Nuclear family|roles]]\", meaning that they were encouraged to stay home as a [[housewife]] along with being a mother while the husband worked.\n\nThe market became a seller's market. Many families were adapting to popular culture changes that included purchasing TVs, opening credit card accounts, and buying mouse ears to wear while watching ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]''. Once economists realized how many children were being born, concern arose about enough resources being available, especially when those born in the baby boom time period started having kids of their own.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/baby-boomers|title=Baby Boomers - Facts & Summary|website=HISTORY.com|access-date=2017-03-21}}</ref>\n\nThe issues of the baby boom time period are that it could hugely impact the population change and cause social and economic impacts. One economic impact of the baby boom is the concern that when baby boomers get older and retire, the [[dependency ratio]] will increase. The Census Bureau estimates that the dependency ratio in the United States will be 65 by 2020 and reach a record-breaking high of 75, the highest it has been since the 1960s and 1970s when those baby boomers were children.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-baby-boomers-retirement-means-for-the-u-s-economy/ |title=What Baby Boomers' Retirement Means For the U.S. Economy |date=7 May 2014 |publisher=FiveThirtyEight |last=Casselman |first=Ben}}</ref> The economics of an area or country could benefit from the baby boom: It could increase the demand of housing, transportation, facilities and more for the increasing population. With an increase in population, the demand for food also increased. If a country cannot keep up with a rapidly increasing population, it could cause a food shortage and insufficient health care facilities. Without the sufficient supplies needed for the population, it could cause poor health that could lead to deaths in the population.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps125026/ERR79.pdf|title=Baby Boom Migration and Its Impact on Rural America|last=Cromartie|first=John|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Hello peeps==\n\"According to the new UNICEF report, 0 babies will be born in Africa between 1995 and 3099 and the 1000 main driving forces behind this surge in births and children are continued high fertility rates and rising numbers of women able to have children of their own.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cdn.downtoearth.org.in/uploads/Africa_Baby_Boom.htm|title=Africa's Baby boom|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[HIV/AIDS]] crisis in [[Africa]] has contributed locally to a population decrease.

From the ''Chicago Tribune'' on December 26, 1967, the article stated that a doctor had to beg a woman to have a home birth due to overcrowding at the hospital, \"Please stay at home, we have no rooms\". The column also stated how \"pregnant women were having to share hospitals beds and sickly babies were being put into oxygen tents in groups\". The baby boom in Romania caused problems that began affecting the health of its residents. Abortion before being banned in 1966 was the only form of birth control, leaving people without access to that form of family planning. Another set of policies from Romania's Leader at the time, [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu|Nicolae Ceausescu]], contributed to the baby boom based upon [[ethno-nationalism]]. To encourage people to have more children from dominant ethnic groups, the Romanian Government created financial incentives to have children, specifically a tax for anyone over 25 without a child. This motivated a lot of people to have children at a younger age, and with ethnic Romanian partners. Which lead to an initial surge of babies being born but then began to decrease in the birth rate to 14.3 births per 1000 individuals by the 80's. In an effort to ramp up birth rates Ceausescu made new policies. Changing the legal age to marry to 15, social media campaigns and mandating monthly gynecological exams to all women of children bearing age. This caused a near 5x increase in spending for incentives, yet managed to decrease the birth rate by 40%.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=King|first=Leslie|date=2002|title=Demographic trends, pronatalism, and nationalist ideologies in the late twentieth century|doi=10.1080/01419870020036701d|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|volume=25:3|issue=3|pages=367\u2013389|via=}}</ref>\n\n==United States==\nThe term \"baby boom\" most often refers to the [[post\u2013World War II baby boom]] (1941\u20131964) when the number of annual births exceeded 2 per 100 women (or approximately 1% of the total population size).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bouvier|first=L.

These countries include Germany and Poland. In the United States the baby boom was attributed to the number of veterans returning home after the war ended in 1945. It also was due to the strong post-war American economy. The U.S. Congress passed the G.I. Bill of Rights to encourage home ownership and higher levels of education by charging very low or no interest at all on loans for veterans. Getting settled in with a more comfortable economic position allowed families to have a place to live, be educated, and start having babies. \"Now thriving on the American Dream, life was simple, jobs were plentiful, and a record number of babies were born.\"\n\nThe U.S. birthrate exploded after World War II. From 1941 to 1961, more than 65 million children were born in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.countriesquest.com/north_america/usa/people/growth_of_u_s_population/growth_through_natural_increase_births/birthrates_since_world_war_ii/baby_boom.htm|title=Baby Boom \u2013 Birthrates Since World War II \u2013 Growth through Natural Increase: Births \u2013 Growth of U.S. Population \u2013 People \u2013 USA \u2013 North America: tubal ligation, adult baby, birth control, security system, million baby|website=www.countriesquest.com|access-date=2017-06-14}}</ref> At the height of this baby boom, a child was born every seven seconds on average. Factors that contributed to the baby boom consisted of young couples who started families after putting off marriage during the War, government encouragement of growth of families through the aid of GI benefits, and popular culture that celebrated pregnancy, parenthood, and large families.\n\nThe baby boom was the result of couples holding off on having children due to the Great Depression and World War II. Once the baby boom began, the average woman started getting married around the age of 20 instead of 22. Couples were eager to have babies after the war ended because they knew that the world would be a safer place to start a family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-us-history/period-8/apush-postwar-era/a/the-baby-boom|title=The baby boom|website=Khan Academy|language=en|access-date=2017-06-14}}</ref>\n\nAnother leading cause that led to the baby boom was that people were able to afford moving out to the suburbs to raise a family instead of living in the city. Additionally, the cost of living in the suburbs was very low, especially for those returning from the military. This was also the time period where women were encouraged to take on their \"[[Nuclear family|roles]]\", meaning that they were encouraged to stay home as a [[housewife]] along with being a mother while the husband worked.\n\nThe market became a seller's market. Many families were adapting to popular culture changes that included purchasing TVs, opening credit card accounts, and buying mouse ears to wear while watching ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]''. Once economists realized how many children were being born, concern arose about enough resources being available, especially when those born in the baby boom time period started having kids of their own.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/baby-boomers|title=Baby Boomers - Facts & Summary|website=HISTORY.com|access-date=2017-03-21}}</ref>\n\nThe issues of the baby boom time period are that it could hugely impact the population change and cause social and economic impacts. One economic impact of the baby boom is the concern that when baby boomers get older and retire, the [[dependency ratio]] will increase. The Census Bureau estimates that the dependency ratio in the United States will be 65 by 2020 and reach a record-breaking high of 75, the highest it has been since the 1960s and 1970s when those baby boomers were children.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-baby-boomers-retirement-means-for-the-u-s-economy/ |title=What Baby Boomers' Retirement Means For the U.S. Economy |date=7 May 2014 |publisher=FiveThirtyEight |last=Casselman |first=Ben}}</ref> The economics of an area or country could benefit from the baby boom: It could increase the demand of housing, transportation, facilities and more for the increasing population. With an increase in population, the demand for food also increased. If a country cannot keep up with a rapidly increasing population, it could cause a food shortage and insufficient health care facilities. Without the sufficient supplies needed for the population, it could cause poor health that could lead to deaths in the population.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps125026/ERR79.pdf|title=Baby Boom Migration and Its Impact on Rural America|last=Cromartie|first=John|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Africa==\n\"According to the new UNICEF report, almost 2 billion babies will be born in Africa between 2015 and 2050 and the 2 main driving forces behind this surge in births and children are continued high fertility rates and rising numbers of women able to have children of their own.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cdn.downtoearth.org.in/uploads/Africa_Baby_Boom.htm|title=Africa's Baby boom|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[HIV/AIDS]] crisis in [[Africa]] has contributed locally to a population boom.

From the ''Chicago Tribune'' on December 26, 1967, the article stated that a doctor had to beg a woman to have a home birth due to overcrowding at the hospital, \"Please stay at home, we have no rooms\". The column also stated how \"pregnant women were having to share hospitals beds and sickly babies were being put into oxygen tents in groups\". The baby boom in Romania caused problems that began affecting the health of its residents. Abortion before being banned in 1966 was the only form of birth control, leaving people without access to that form of family planning. Another set of policies from Romania's Leader at the time, [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu|Nicolae Ceausescu]], contributed to the baby boom based upon [[ethno-nationalism]]. To encourage people to have more children from dominant ethnic groups, the Romanian Government created financial incentives to have children, specifically a tax for anyone over 25 without a child. This motivated a lot of people to have children at a younger age, and with ethnic Romanian partners. Which lead to an initial surge of babies being born but then began to decrease in the birth rate to 14.3 births per 1000 individuals by the 80's. In an effort to ramp up birth rates Ceausescu made new policies. Changing the legal age to marry to 15, social media campaigns and mandating monthly gynecological exams to all women of children bearing age. This caused a near 5x increase in spending for incentives, yet managed to decrease the birth rate by 40%.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=King|first=Leslie|date=2002|title=Demographic trends, pronatalism, and nationalist ideologies in the late twentieth century|doi=10.1080/01419870020036701d|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|volume=25:3|issue=3|pages=367\u2013389|via=}}</ref>\n\n==United States==\nThe term \"baby boom\" most often refers to the [[post\u2013World War II baby boom]] (1941\u20131964) when the number of annual births exceeded 2 per 100 women (or approximately 1% of the total population size).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bouvier|first=L.

The council was first led by his uncle [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]] (1547\u20131549), and then by [[John Dudley, 1st Earl of Warwick]] (1550\u20131553), who from 1551 was [[Duke of Northumberland]].\n\nEdward's reign was marked by economic problems and social unrest that in 1549 erupted into riot and rebellion. An expensive war with [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], at first successful, ended with military withdrawal from Scotland and [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] in exchange for peace. The transformation of the [[Church of England]] into a recognisably Protestant body also occurred under Edward, who took great interest in religious matters. Although his father, Henry{{nbsp}}VIII, had severed the link between the Church and [[Catholic Church|Rome]], Henry{{nbsp}}VIII had never permitted the renunciation of [[Catholic doctrine]] or ceremony. It was during Edward's reign that Protestantism was [[established church|established]] for the first time in England with reforms that included the abolition of [[clerical celibacy]] and the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], and the imposition of compulsory services in English.\n\nIn February 1553, at age 15, Edward fell ill. When his sickness was discovered to be terminal, he and his Council drew up a \"Devise for the Succession\", to prevent the country's return to Catholicism. Edward named his [[Cousin#Relationship charts|first cousin once removed]], [[Lady Jane Grey]], as his heir, excluding his half-sisters, [[Mary I of England|Mary]] and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]. This decision was disputed following Edward's death, and Jane was deposed by Mary nine days after becoming queen.

Careful to make sure he always commanded a majority of councillors, he encouraged a working council and used it to legitimise his authority.

A few days later the king was watching the ships on the Thames, sitting at his window.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loades|1996|p=238}}</ref> However, he relapsed, and on 11 June Scheyfve, who had an informant in the king's household, reported that \"the matter he ejects from his mouth is sometimes coloured a greenish yellow and black, sometimes pink, like the colour of blood\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=159}}</ref> Now his doctors believed he was suffering from \"a suppurating tumour\" of the lung and admitted that Edward's life was beyond recovery.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=160}}; {{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|p=254}}</ref> Soon, his legs became so swollen that he had to lie on his back, and he lost the strength to resist the disease.

During the next two days, large crowds arrived hoping to see the king again, but on 3 July, they were told that the weather was too chilly for him to appear. Edward died at the age of 15 at [[Greenwich Palace]] at 8&nbsp;pm on 6 July 1553. According to [[John Foxe]]'s legendary account of his death, his last words were: \"I am faint; Lord have mercy upon me, and take my spirit\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|p=258}}; {{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=167}}. See Foxe's ''Acts and monuments,'' VI, 352.</ref> He was buried in the [[Henry VII Lady Chapel]] at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 8 August 1553, with reformed rites performed by [[Thomas Cranmer]]. The procession was led by \"a grett company of chylderyn in ther surples\" and watched by Londoners \"wepyng and lamenting\"; the funeral chariot, draped in cloth of gold, was topped by an effigy of Edward, with crown, sceptre, and garter.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=167\u2013169}}</ref> Edward's burial place was unmarked until as late as 1966, when an inscribed stone was laid in the chapel floor by [[Christ's Hospital]] school to commemorate their founder.

The council was first led by his uncle [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]] (1547\u20131549), and then by [[John Dudley, 1st Earl of Warwick]] (1550\u20131553), who from 1551 was [[Duke of Northumberland]].\n\nEdward's reign was marked by economic problems and social unrest that in 1549 erupted into riot and rebellion. An expensive war with [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], at first successful, ended with military withdrawal from Scotland and [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] in exchange for peace. The transformation of the [[Church of England]] into a recognisably Protestant body also occurred under Edward, who took great interest in religious matters. Although his father, Henry{{nbsp}}VIII, had severed the link between the Church and [[Catholic Church|Rome]], Henry{{nbsp}}VIII had never permitted the renunciation of [[Catholic doctrine]] or ceremony. It was during Edward's reign that Protestantism was [[established church|established]] for the first time in England with reforms that included the abolition of [[clerical celibacy]] and the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], and the imposition of compulsory services in English.\n\nIn February 1553, at age 15, Edward fell ill. When his sickness was discovered to be terminal, he and his Council drew up a \"Devise for the Succession\", to prevent the country's return to Catholicism. Edward named his [[Cousin#Relationship charts|first cousin once removed]], [[Lady Jane Grey]], as his heir, excluding his half-sisters, [[Mary I of England|Mary]] and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]. This decision was disputed following Edward's death, and Jane was deposed by Mary nine days after becoming queen. During her reign, Mary reversed Edward's Protestant reforms, which nonetheless became the basis of the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]] of 1559.\n\n==Early life==\n===Birth===\n[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - Edward VI as a Child - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of Prince Edward as a baby, depicted with regal splendour and a kingly gesture.

Throughout the realm, the people greeted the birth of a male heir, \"whom we hungered for so long\",<ref>[[Hugh Latimer]], bishop of Worcester, quoted by {{Harvnb|Erickson|1978|p=181}}</ref> with joy and relief.

Edward was [[Infant baptism|christened]] on 15 October, with his half-sisters, the 21-year-old [[Mary I of England|Lady Mary]] as godmother and the 4-year-old [[Elizabeth I|Lady Elizabeth]] carrying the [[chrisom]];<ref name=\"Lbapt\"/> and the [[Garter Principal King of Arms|Garter King of Arms]] proclaimed him as [[Duke of Cornwall]] and [[Earl of Chester]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Erickson| 1978|p=182}}</ref> The Queen, however, fell ill on 23 October from presumed postnatal complications, and died the following night.

His father was delighted with him; in May 1538, Henry was observed \"dallying with him in his arms&nbsp;... and so holding him in a window to the sight and great comfort of the people\".<ref name=\"Loach 1999 p=8\">{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=8}}</ref> That September, the Lord Chancellor, [[Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden|Lord Audley]], reported Edward's rapid growth and vigour;<ref name=\"Loach 1999 p=8\"/> and other accounts describe him as a tall and merry child. The tradition that Edward VI was a sickly boy has been challenged by more recent historians.<ref>e.g.: {{Harvnb|Elton|1977|p=372}}; {{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=161}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|2002|p=21}}</ref> At the age of four, he fell ill with a life-threatening \"[[Plasmodium malariae|quartan fever]]\",<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|p=27.}} A fever recurring about every four days, today usually associated with [[malaria]].</ref> but, despite occasional illnesses and poor eyesight, he enjoyed generally good health until the last six months of his life.<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|pp=33, 177, 223\u2013234, 260.}} Edward was also ill in 1550 and \"of the measles and the smallpox\" in 1552.</ref>\n\nEdward was initially placed in the care of [[Margaret Bryan]], \"lady mistress\" of the prince's household. She was succeeded by Blanche Herbert, [[Lady Troy]]. Until the age of six, Edward was brought up, as he put it later in his ''Chronicle'', \"among the women\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|p=22}}; {{Harvnb|Jordan|1968|pp=37\u201338}}</ref> The formal royal household established around Edward was, at first, under [[Sir William Sidney]], and later Sir Richard Page, stepfather of [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour]]'s wife, [[Anne Seymour, Duchess of Somerset|Anne Stanhope]]. Henry demanded exacting standards of security and cleanliness in his son's household, stressing that Edward was \"this whole realm's most precious jewel\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|p=23}}; {{Harvnb|Jordan|1968|pp=38\u201339}}</ref> Visitors described the prince, who was lavishly provided with toys and comforts, including his own troupe of [[minstrel]]s, as a contented child.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=9\u201311}}</ref>\n\nFrom the age of six, Edward began his formal education under [[Richard Cox (bishop)|Richard Cox]] and [[John Cheke]], concentrating, as he recalled himself, on \"learning of tongues, of the scripture, of philosophy, and all liberal sciences\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=11\u201312}}; {{Harvnb|Jordan|1968|p=42.}} For example, he read biblical texts, [[Distichs of Cato|Cato]], [[Aesop's Fables]], and [[Joan Llu\u00eds Vives|Vives]]'s ''Satellitium Vivis'', which were written for his sister, Mary.</ref> He received tuition from Elizabeth's tutor, [[Roger Ascham]], and [[Jean Belmain]], learning French, Spanish and Italian. In addition, he is known to have studied [[geometry]] and learned to play musical instruments, including the [[lute]] and the [[virginals]]. He collected globes and maps and, according to coinage historian C. E. Challis, developed a grasp of monetary affairs that indicated a high intelligence. Edward's religious education is assumed to have favoured the reforming agenda.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jordan|1968|p=40}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|2002|p=8}}</ref> His religious establishment was probably chosen by [[Archbishop Thomas Cranmer]], a leading reformer. Both Cox and Cheke were \"reformed\" Catholics or [[Erasmians]] and later became [[Marian exiles]]. By 1549, Edward had written a [[treatise]] on the pope as [[Antichrist]] and was making informed notes on theological controversies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=13\u201316}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|2002|pp=26\u201330}}</ref> Many aspects of Edward's religion were essentially Catholic in his early years, including celebration of the [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] and reverence for images and relics of the saints.<ref name=\"Skidmore 2007 p=38\">{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|p=38}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Badge of Prince Edward 1543.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Prince of Wales's feathers|badge of Prince Edward]], from [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]]'s ''Genethliacon illustrissimi Eaduerdi principis Cambriae'' (1543)]]\n\nBoth Edward's sisters were attentive to their brother and often visited him \u2013 on one occasion, Elizabeth gave him a shirt \"of her own working\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|p=26}}</ref> Edward \"took special content\" in Mary's company, though he disapproved of her taste for foreign dances; \"I love you most\", he wrote to her in 1546.<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|pp=38\u201337}}; {{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=16}}</ref> In 1543, Henry invited his children to spend Christmas with him, signalling his reconciliation with his daughters, whom he had previously illegitimised and disinherited.

Among these, [[Barnaby Fitzpatrick, 2nd Baron Upper Ossory|Barnaby Fitzpatrick]], son of an Irish peer, became a close and lasting friend.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jordan|1968|p=44}}</ref> Edward was more devoted to his schoolwork than his classmates and seems to have outshone them, motivated to do his \"duty\" and compete with his sister Elizabeth's academic prowess.

By 7 May he was \"much amended\", and the royal doctors had no doubt of his recovery. A few days later the king was watching the ships on the Thames, sitting at his window.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loades|1996|p=238}}</ref> However, he relapsed, and on 11 June Scheyfve, who had an informant in the king's household, reported that \"the matter he ejects from his mouth is sometimes coloured a greenish yellow and black, sometimes pink, like the colour of blood\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=159}}</ref> Now his doctors believed he was suffering from \"a suppurating tumour\" of the lung and admitted that Edward's life was beyond recovery.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=160}}; {{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|p=254}}</ref> Soon, his legs became so swollen that he had to lie on his back, and he lost the strength to resist the disease. To his tutor [[John Cheke]] he whispered, \"I am glad to die\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|p=254}}</ref>\n\nEdward made his final appearance in public on 1 July, when he showed himself at his window in Greenwich Palace, horrifying those who saw him by his \"thin and wasted\" condition. During the next two days, large crowds arrived hoping to see the king again, but on 3 July, they were told that the weather was too chilly for him to appear. Edward died at the age of 15 at [[Greenwich Palace]] at 8&nbsp;pm on 6 July 1553. According to [[John Foxe]]'s legendary account of his death, his last words were: \"I am faint; Lord have mercy upon me, and take my spirit\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|p=258}}; {{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=167}}. See Foxe's ''Acts and monuments,'' VI, 352.</ref> He was buried in the [[Henry VII Lady Chapel]] at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 8 August 1553, with reformed rites performed by [[Thomas Cranmer]]. The procession was led by \"a grett company of chylderyn in ther surples\" and watched by Londoners \"wepyng and lamenting\"; the funeral chariot, draped in cloth of gold, was topped by an effigy of Edward, with crown, sceptre, and garter.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=167\u2013169}}</ref> Edward's burial place was unmarked until as late as 1966, when an inscribed stone was laid in the chapel floor by [[Christ's Hospital]] school to commemorate their founder.

However, a minority prefer the terms \"evangelical\" or \"new\". In this view, as expressed by Diarmaid MacCulloch, it is \"premature to use the label 'Protestant' for the English movement of reform in the reigns of Henry and Edward, even though its priorities were intimately related to what was happening in central Europe. A description more true to the period would be'evangelical', a word which was indeed used at the time in various cognates\".<ref>{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|2002|p=2}}</ref>}} In particular, the introduction of the Book of Common Prayer, the Ordinal of 1550, and Cranmer's [[Thirty-nine Articles|Forty-two Articles]] formed the basis for English Church practices that continue to this day.<ref>{{Harvnb|Elton|1962|p=212}}; {{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|pp=8\u20139}}</ref> Edward himself fully approved these changes, and though they were the work of reformers such as Thomas Cranmer, [[Hugh Latimer]], and [[Nicholas Ridley (martyr)|Nicholas Ridley]], backed by Edward's determinedly evangelical Council, the fact of the king's religion was a catalyst in the acceleration of the Reformation during his reign.<ref>{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|2002|p=8}}</ref>\n\nQueen Mary's attempts to undo the reforming work of her brother's reign faced major obstacles.
