However, the county was renamed on December 6, 1861 in honor of [[Francis S. Bartow]] because of Cass's support of the Union,<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IP4vAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2jsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4196%2C213560 | title=Bartow County | work=Calhoun Times | date=September 1, 2004 | accessdate=23 April 2015 | pages=13}}</ref> even though Bartow never visited in the county, living {{Convert|200|mi|km|abbr=out}} away near Savannah all of his life. Cass had supported the doctrine of [[popular sovereignty]], the right of each state to determine its own laws independently of the Federal government, the platform of conservative Southerners who removed his name. The first county seat was at [[Cassville, Georgia|Cassville]], but after the burning of the county courthouse and the Sherman Occupation, the seat moved to Cartersville, where it remains.\n\nThe county was profoundly affected by the Civil War, setting it back economically for many decades. May 18 and 19, 1864, General [[George Henry Thomas]] led the Army of the Cumberland after General [[William J. Hardee]]'s Corps of the Army of Tennessee, and General [[James B. McPherson]] led his Federal Army of the Tennessee flanking Hardee's army to the west. This huge army was disruptive and sought food. Elements were out of control and sacked homes depleting meager supplies.<ref>{{Cite book |first = Frances Thomas |last = Howard |authorlink =  |coauthors = |title = In and Out of the Lines|publisher = Etowah Valley Historical Society |year = 2007 |location = Cartesville, Georgia |pages =9, overleaf |url = |doi = |id = |isbn =  }}</ref>\n\nProperty destruction and the deaths of one-third of the county's soldiers during the war caused financial and social calamity for many.\n\nSlaves gained their freedom, and for over a decade exercised the political franchise through the Republican Party. In 1870, about 1 black family in 12 owned real estate. More of the blacks lived in white-headed households, working as domestic servants and laborers. The great majority of freedpeople were day laborers or farm laborers, while a sizable minority occupied skilled positions such as blacksmiths, wheelwrights, and iron workers.<ref>Keith S.

Cass had supported the doctrine of [[popular sovereignty]], the right of each state to determine its own laws independently of the Federal government, the platform of conservative Southerners who removed his name. The first county seat was at [[Cassville, Georgia|Cassville]], but after the burning of the county courthouse and the Sherman Occupation, the seat moved to Cartersville, where it remains.\n\nThe county was profoundly affected by the Civil War, setting it back economically for many decades. May 18 and 19, 1864, General [[George Henry Thomas]] led the Army of the Cumberland after General [[William J. Hardee]]'s Corps of the Army of Tennessee, and General [[James B. McPherson]] led his Federal Army of the Tennessee flanking Hardee's army to the west. This huge army was disruptive and sought food. Elements were out of control and sacked homes depleting meager supplies.<ref>{{Cite book |first = Frances Thomas |last = Howard |authorlink =  |coauthors = |title = In and Out of the Lines|publisher = Etowah Valley Historical Society |year = 2007 |location = Cartesville, Georgia |pages =9, overleaf |url = |doi = |id = |isbn =  }}</ref>\n\nProperty destruction and the deaths of one-third of the county's soldiers during the war caused financial and social calamity for many.\n\nSlaves gained their freedom, and for over a decade exercised the political franchise through the Republican Party. In 1870, about 1 black family in 12 owned real estate. More of the blacks lived in white-headed households, working as domestic servants and laborers. The great majority of freedpeople were day laborers or farm laborers, while a sizable minority occupied skilled positions such as blacksmiths, wheelwrights, and iron workers.<ref>Keith S.

At various times in its history, the Florida peninsula has been a series of small island with only small slivers such as the ridges in Polk County above water, and other times a much wider peninsula than it is today. It was during a time when Florida was at its widest that the first [[Paleo-Indians|paleo-indians]] probably arrived in the Bartow area as they followed big game such as woolly mammoth southward. At the time, the climate of the area was much different than it is today; cooler, drier- probably similar to that found in the [[British Isles]] today.\n\nThe first [[Paleo-indians]] reached the central Florida area near the end of the last [[ice age]], as they followed big game south.<ref name=\"Ancient Native:The Ancient One\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.ancientnative.org/tao.php \n |title=Ancient Native \n |accessdate=2010-09-09 \n |publisher=HOTOA \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017085248/http://www.ancientnative.org/tao.php \n |archivedate=2010-10-17 \n}}</ref><ref name=\"Polk County History\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.polkcountyhistory.org/History.asp \n |title=Polk County History \n |accessdate=2010-09-11 \n |publisher=Polk County Historical Association \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727182027/http://www.polkcountyhistory.org/History.asp \n |archivedate=2011-07-27 \n}}</ref> These first Floridians were hunters and small gatherers and left little impact on the area. As the ice melted and sea levels rose, these Indians gave way to the first Indians which set up permanent residence. These Indians thrived on the Florida peninsula for thousands of years and it is estimated that by the time the first [[Spain|Spanish]] conquistadors arrived, there were 250,000 Native Americans living on the Florida peninsula. Some of these first early tribes were the [[Tocobago]], [[Timucua]] and the [[Calusa]]. In 1527, a Spanish map showed a settlement near the [[Peace River (Florida)|Rio de la Paz]].<ref name=\"Ancient Native:The Ancient One\"/><ref name=\"Polk County History\"/> The arrival of the Spanish turned out to be disastrous to these Native American tribes. Within 150 years, the majority of the [[pre-Columbian]] Native American peoples of Florida had been wiped out.

Eventually the remnants of these tribes would merge with Creek Indians who arrived from the north and become the [[Seminoles|Seminole Indian tribe]].<ref name=\"Polk County History\"/><ref name=\"Trail of Florida's Indian Heritage\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, European powers were struggling to establish themselves on the Florida peninsula. The Spanish, [[France|French]] and [[Great Britain|British]] all gained and lost control over Florida before the United States finally gained permanent control of the peninsula in 1819. By this time, the Seminoles had established themselves on the peninsula and proved to be an impediment to white settlement of Florida. At first, the United States attempted to force the Seminoles onto a large reservation covering much of Central Florida, which included the land now part of present-day Bartow. At the conclusion of the [[First Seminole War]], the United States passed the [[Indian Removal Act|Indian Removal Act of 1830]], which attempted to remove most of the Seminoles to Oklahoma.\n\n==Antebellum beginnings==\nIn 1845 Florida became the 27th state and the time seemed right for the part of Florida south of [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]] to grow. This growth was slow at first: heat and humidity, dangerous wildlife, and uncharted swampland made a comfortable life in southern Florida problematic. A bigger potential threat were those Seminoles who had decided to stay instead of going to [[Oklahoma]]. These Indians were, for the most part, peaceful; but many white settlers felt uneasy about the continued Seminole presence around the Peace River and stories were told of attacks \"not far away.\" As a result, many of these early settlements were built as forts to discourage any Indian aggression.<ref name=\"Chamber of Commerce, History\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.bartowchamber.com/our-community/history\n| title = Chamber of Commerce, History\n| accessdate =  2010-09-11\n| publisher = Bartow Chamber of Commerce\n}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Armed Occupation Act|Armed Occupation Act of 1842]] prohibited settlement near the Peace River as that was considered Seminole land; however cattlemen eventually moved in from Tampa Bay and into the area surrounding the Peace River anyway.<ref name=\"Polk County History\"/>\n\nIn 1851, the settlement of '''Fort Blount''' was founded by Redding Blount just west of current downtown Bartow.<ref name=\"A look back in time\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://mainstreetbartow.com/time.asp\n |title       = A look back in time\n |accessdate  = 2010-09-11\n |publisher   = Mainstreet Bartow\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20091226230300/http://mainstreetbartow.com/time.asp\n |archivedate = 2009-12-26\n}}</ref> This settlement was eventually renamed '''Peace Creek''' or '''Peas Creek'''.

The first site chosen for the county seat was actually near present-day Highland City, but the war meant that the plans for building the seat would be delayed. At the time there were still few families living in Polk County. Like much of the south, the Civil War was a disaster for everyday life in Polk County.

At this time, a wealthy cattleman named [[Jacob Summerlin]] donated a large part of the old Blount homestead. This land would be used to build the first Polk County courthouse, the first high school in the county, and two churches. This proved to be the crucial event in the development of both Bartow and Polk County. Although growth was slow at first and Bartow had less than 4 00 permanent residents by 1880, the town would grow exponentially in the last two decades of the 19th Century. In 1887 the first brick schoolhouse south of [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] was built. This school named [[Bartow High School|Summerlin Institute]] (now Bartow High School) would eventually become one of the most respected high schools in the [[Southern United States|south]]. Around the same time, the first library in central Florida would be built. By the turn of the century, Bartow would become the third most populous city in central Florida and the fifteenth most populous in the state.<ref name=\"1900 Census\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/33405927v1ch08.pdf\n| title = Us Census\n| accessdate = 2010-09-16\n| publisher = US Census\n}}</ref>\n\n==20th century to present==\nDuring the 20th century, Bartow grew slowly as the rest of the state experienced a huge population boom. In 1909, a new courthouse was built on the corner of Main Street and Broadway Avenue. This courthouse is still standing and is the  current site of the Polk County Historical Museum.\n\nAs the city grew, a number of industries moved into the Bartow area. In the first few decades of the 1900s, thousands of acres of land around the city were purchased by the [[phosphate]] industry and Bartow would become the hub of the largest phosphate industry in the United States. After a succession of freezes north of Polk County, the county eventually became the leading citrus county in the United States and much of the agriculture of areas surrounding Bartow is citrus based. In 1941, the city built an airport northeast of town. This airport was taken over by the federal government during [[World War II]]. This airport would be the training location for many [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] pilots. This airport would eventually be returned to the city in 1967.<ref name=\"Airport History\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.firehouse.com/forums/showthread.php?t=72663\n| title = Airport History\n| accessdate = 2010-09-12\n| publisher = Bartow Municipal Airport\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Bartow was severely impacted by three [[tropical cyclones|hurricanes]] which hit the area within a space of 44 days.<ref name=\"Polk County takes a place in history\">{{cite web\n| author = Frisbie, L\n| url = http://www.firehouse.com/forums/showthread.php?t=72663\n| title = Polk County takes a place in history\n| accessdate = 2010-09-12\n| publisher = Polk County Democrat\n}}</ref> The eye of all three hurricanes, [[Hurricane Charley]], [[Hurricane Frances]] and [[Hurricane Jeanne]], passed within {{convert|10|mi|km}} of town.<ref name=\"Polk County takes a place in history\"/><ref name=\"The Hurricane Recovery Task Force Report\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.haznet.org/haznet_pdf/hurr_tf_report_v02.pdf\n| title = The Hurricane Recovery Task Force Report\n| accessdate = 2010-09-12\n| publisher = Hurricane Recovery Task Force\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726142637/http://www.haznet.org/haznet_pdf/hurr_tf_report_v02.pdf\n| archive-date = 2011-07-26\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref> The damage from the three storms, especially Charley, was extensive.

While other cities in Polk County aggressively annexed adjacent land and allowed rapid growth, the government of Bartow generally took a more cautious approach.

With the annexation of over 18,000 acres of former phosphate land owned by the Clear Creek Development Company, Bartow has more than quadrupled in size and is projected to triple in population within the next twenty years.\n\nThere is an old Bartow saying that no town has produced more prominent people per capita since Jamestown.<ref name=\"History of Bartow\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.bartowchamber.com/our-community/history\n| title = History of Bartow \n| accessdate = 2010-09-27\n| publisher = Bartow Chamber of Commerce\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Bartow History\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://mainstreetbartow.com/time.asp\n |title       = Bartow History\n |accessdate  = 2010-09-27\n |publisher   = Main Street Bartow\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20091226230300/http://mainstreetbartow.com/time.asp\n |archivedate = 2009-12-26\n}}</ref> That may be a point which is open to debate, but there is no doubt that Bartow has produced its share of  prominent people in a myriad number of ways; Former  Florida governor and U.S. senator [[Spessard Holland]], controversial Florida Secretary of State [[Katherine Harris]], [[Playboy Playmate]] [[Jaime Faith Edmondson]], Tony-winning actress [[Karen Olivo]], Winston Cup Stock Car Driver Rick Wilson, iconoclast [[Marshall Ledbetter]], [[Pro Bowl]] [[linebacker]] [[Ray Lewis]], [[motorcross]] legend [[James Stewart, Jr.|Bubba Stewart]], and three United States generals are among the people who were born in, raised in, or in some way have a connection with the ''City of Oaks and Azaleas.''\n\n==Pre-Columbian era to statehood ==\nThe [[Physical geography|physiographic history]] of the Florida peninsula is one of constant expansion and contraction. At various times in its history, the Florida peninsula has been a series of small island with only small slivers such as the ridges in Polk County above water, and other times a much wider peninsula than it is today. It was during a time when Florida was at its widest that the first [[Paleo-Indians|paleo-indians]] probably arrived in the Bartow area as they followed big game such as woolly mammoth southward. At the time, the climate of the area was much different than it is today; cooler, drier- probably similar to that found in the [[British Isles]] today.\n\nThe first [[Paleo-indians]] reached the central Florida area near the end of the last [[ice age]], as they followed big game south.<ref name=\"Ancient Native:The Ancient One\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.ancientnative.org/tao.php \n |title=Ancient Native \n |accessdate=2010-09-09 \n |publisher=HOTOA \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017085248/http://www.ancientnative.org/tao.php \n |archivedate=2010-10-17 \n}}</ref><ref name=\"Polk County History\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.polkcountyhistory.org/History.asp \n |title=Polk County History \n |accessdate=2010-09-11 \n |publisher=Polk County Historical Association \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727182027/http://www.polkcountyhistory.org/History.asp \n |archivedate=2011-07-27 \n}}</ref> These first Floridians were hunters and small gatherers and left little impact on the area. As the ice melted and sea levels rose, these Indians gave way to the first Indians which set up permanent residence. These Indians thrived on the Florida peninsula for thousands of years and it is estimated that by the time the first [[Spain|Spanish]] conquistadors arrived, there were 250,000 Native Americans living on the Florida peninsula. Some of these first early tribes were the [[Tocobago]], [[Timucua]] and the [[Calusa]]. In 1527, a Spanish map showed a settlement near the [[Peace River (Florida)|Rio de la Paz]].<ref name=\"Ancient Native:The Ancient One\"/><ref name=\"Polk County History\"/> The arrival of the Spanish turned out to be disastrous to these Native American tribes. Within 150 years, the majority of the [[pre-Columbian]] Native American peoples of Florida had been wiped out. Those who had not succumbed to diseases such as Small Pox or Yellow Fever were either killed or enslaved.<ref name=\"Ancient Native:The Ancient One\"/><ref name=\"Polk County History\"/><ref name=\"The Ancient Ones\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.ancientnative.org/index.php \n |title=The Ancient Ones \n |accessdate=2010-09-09 \n |publisher=HOTOA \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017085328/http://www.ancientnative.org/index.php \n |archivedate=2010-10-17 \n}}</ref><ref name=\"Trail of Florida's Indian Heritage\">{{cite web\n |author      = Weibel, B\n |url         = http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/florida-native-american-museums-7383.html\n |title       = Trail of Florida's Ancient Heritage\n |accessdate  = 2010-09-09\n |publisher   = active.com\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100713193146/http://attractions.uptake.com/blog/florida-native-american-museums-7383.html\n |archivedate = 2010-07-13\n}}</ref> Little is left of these first Native Americans cultures in Polk County except for scant archeological records including a few personal artifacts and shell mounds. Eventually the remnants of these tribes would merge with Creek Indians who arrived from the north and become the [[Seminoles|Seminole Indian tribe]].<ref name=\"Polk County History\"/><ref name=\"Trail of Florida's Indian Heritage\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, European powers were struggling to establish themselves on the Florida peninsula. The Spanish, [[France|French]] and [[Great Britain|British]] all gained and lost control over Florida before the United States finally gained permanent control of the peninsula in 1819. By this time, the Seminoles had established themselves on the peninsula and proved to be an impediment to white settlement of Florida. At first, the United States attempted to force the Seminoles onto a large reservation covering much of Central Florida, which included the land now part of present-day Bartow. At the conclusion of the [[First Seminole War]], the United States passed the [[Indian Removal Act|Indian Removal Act of 1830]], which attempted to remove most of the Seminoles to Oklahoma.\n\n==Antebellum beginnings==\nIn 1845 Florida became the 27th state and the time seemed right for the part of Florida south of [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]] to grow. This growth was slow at first: heat and humidity, dangerous wildlife, and uncharted swampland made a comfortable life in southern Florida problematic. A bigger potential threat were those Seminoles who had decided to stay instead of going to [[Oklahoma]]. These Indians were, for the most part, peaceful; but many white settlers felt uneasy about the continued Seminole presence around the Peace River and stories were told of attacks \"not far away.\" As a result, many of these early settlements were built as forts to discourage any Indian aggression.<ref name=\"Chamber of Commerce, History\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.bartowchamber.com/our-community/history\n| title = Chamber of Commerce, History\n| accessdate =  2010-09-11\n| publisher = Bartow Chamber of Commerce\n}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Armed Occupation Act|Armed Occupation Act of 1842]] prohibited settlement near the Peace River as that was considered Seminole land; however cattlemen eventually moved in from Tampa Bay and into the area surrounding the Peace River anyway.<ref name=\"Polk County History\"/>\n\nIn 1851, the settlement of '''Fort Blount''' was founded by Redding Blount just west of current downtown Bartow.<ref name=\"A look back in time\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://mainstreetbartow.com/time.asp\n |title       = A look back in time\n |accessdate  = 2010-09-11\n |publisher   = Mainstreet Bartow\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20091226230300/http://mainstreetbartow.com/time.asp\n |archivedate = 2009-12-26\n}}</ref> This settlement was eventually renamed '''Peace Creek''' or '''Peas Creek'''.

The first site chosen for the county seat was actually near present-day Highland City, but the war meant that the plans for building the seat would be delayed. At the time there were still few families living in Polk County. Like much of the south, the Civil War was a disaster for everyday life in Polk County.

At this time, a wealthy cattleman named [[Jacob Summerlin]] donated a large part of the old Blount homestead. This land would be used to build the first Polk County courthouse, the first high school in the county, and two churches. This proved to be the crucial event in the development of both Bartow and Polk County. Although growth was slow at first and Bartow had less than 4 00 permanent residents by 1880, the town would grow exponentially in the last two decades of the 19th Century. In 1887 the first brick schoolhouse south of [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] was built. This school named [[Bartow High School|Summerlin Institute]] (now Bartow High School) would eventually become one of the most respected high schools in the [[Southern United States|south]]. Around the same time, the first library in central Florida would be built. By the turn of the century, Bartow would become the third most populous city in central Florida and the fifteenth most populous in the state.<ref name=\"1900 Census\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/33405927v1ch08.pdf\n| title = Us Census\n| accessdate = 2010-09-16\n| publisher = US Census\n}}</ref>\n\n==20th century to present==\nDuring the 20th century, Bartow grew slowly as the rest of the state experienced a huge population boom. In 1909, a new courthouse was built on the corner of Main Street and Broadway Avenue. This courthouse is still standing and is the  current site of the Polk County Historical Museum.\n\nAs the city grew, a number of industries moved into the Bartow area. In the first few decades of the 1900s, thousands of acres of land around the city were purchased by the [[phosphate]] industry and Bartow would become the hub of the largest phosphate industry in the United States. After a succession of freezes north of Polk County, the county eventually became the leading citrus county in the United States and much of the agriculture of areas surrounding Bartow is citrus based. In 1941, the city built an airport northeast of town. This airport was taken over by the federal government during [[World War II]]. This airport would be the training location for many [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] pilots. This airport would eventually be returned to the city in 1967.<ref name=\"Airport History\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.firehouse.com/forums/showthread.php?t=72663\n| title = Airport History\n| accessdate = 2010-09-12\n| publisher = Bartow Municipal Airport\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Bartow was severely impacted by three [[tropical cyclones|hurricanes]] which hit the area within a space of 44 days.<ref name=\"Polk County takes a place in history\">{{cite web\n| author = Frisbie, L\n| url = http://www.firehouse.com/forums/showthread.php?t=72663\n| title = Polk County takes a place in history\n| accessdate = 2010-09-12\n| publisher = Polk County Democrat\n}}</ref> The eye of all three hurricanes, [[Hurricane Charley]], [[Hurricane Frances]] and [[Hurricane Jeanne]], passed within {{convert|10|mi|km}} of town.<ref name=\"Polk County takes a place in history\"/><ref name=\"The Hurricane Recovery Task Force Report\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.haznet.org/haznet_pdf/hurr_tf_report_v02.pdf\n| title = The Hurricane Recovery Task Force Report\n| accessdate = 2010-09-12\n| publisher = Hurricane Recovery Task Force\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726142637/http://www.haznet.org/haznet_pdf/hurr_tf_report_v02.pdf\n| archive-date = 2011-07-26\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref> The damage from the three storms, especially Charley, was extensive.

While other cities in Polk County aggressively annexed adjacent land and allowed rapid growth, the government of Bartow generally took a more cautious approach.

It was incorporated as a district municipality in 1892, growing to include additional villages and rural areas over the years, adding the original Town of '''Mission City''', long an independent core of the region, in 1969.\n\nIt is situated on the north bank of the [[Fraser River]], backing onto mountains and lakes overlooking the [[Fraser Valley|Central Fraser Valley]], {{convert|80|km|miles|abbr=on}} east-southeast of [[Vancouver]], British Columbia.\n\n==Geography==\nUnlike the other [[Fraser Valley]] municipalities, Mission is mostly forested upland with only small floodplains lining the shore of the Fraser River. Some benches of farmland rise in succession northwards above the core developed area of the city. Mission was once the heart of the berry industry in the Fraser Valley, with \"Home of the Big Red Strawberry\" as Mission's slogan in the 1930s and into the 1940s.\n\nThe more southerly portion of the municipality is bounded on the west by the lower reaches of the [[Stave River]], which consists mostly of the lakewaters of two hydroelectric reservoirs, [[Stave Lake]] and [[Hayward Lake]]. Although the vast majority of the population of Mission lives well to the east of the Stave, over 50% of the northern land area of the municipality is west and north of that river; its extreme northwest corner is on the far side of upper [[Alouette Lake]]. A small portion of the lower Stave still runs free in its last two miles before its confluence with the [[Fraser River|Fraser]] at [[Ruskin, British Columbia|Ruskin]]; its last three-quarters of a mile forms the border with the larger municipality of [[Maple Ridge, British Columbia|Maple Ridge]] to the west.\n\n[[File:Snow-capped mountain.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Mount Robie Reid lies just past Mission's northern boundary.]]Over 40% of Mission is actually tree farm, making it only one of two communities with municipal [[tree farm]]s. (Revelstoke BC, with a much smaller and newer farm, is the second.) Mission's tree farm celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2008.  It comprises much of the northern part of the district, including the area west of the Stave River, up to the district's northern boundary near the foot of [[Mount Robie Reid]]; a small sliver of Mission District is at the head of [[Alouette Lake]] (normally thought of as being in Maple Ridge).\n\nThe eastern boundary of the municipality roughly coincides with the division between the Mission upland and the alluvial floodplain of Hatzic Prairie, which resembles much of the rest of the Fraser Valley Lowland. The unincorporated communities from Hatzic eastwards through [[Dewdney, British Columbia|Dewdney]] and [[Nicomen Island]] to [[Deroche, British Columbia|Deroche]] are part of the social and commercial matrix centred on Mission but have never joined the municipality, as is also the case with areas north of Hatzic and Dewdney such as [[McConnell Creek, British Columbia|McConnell Creek]] and [[Durieu, British Columbia|Durieu]]; the local economy and societies are built on dairy, berry and corn farming as well as a large [[First Nations]] community at the Indian Reserves of the [[Leq' a: mel First Nation]], formerly known as the Lakahahmen First Nation, on [[Nicomen Island]] and [[Deroche, British Columbia|Deroche]].\n\n==Government==\nMission was incorporated in 1892 and is {{convert|225.78|km2|abbr=on}} in size. In 1922 the District of Mission was partitioned by the creation of the Village of Mission, which later became the Village of Mission City, then the Town of Mission City, until amalgamated with the District by plebiscite in 1969.\n\nThe District of Mission uses the current Council-Manager system of local government. The present Mayor and Council, was elected on November 15, 2018. The current mayor is [[Pam Alexis]]. A notable past mayor is [[Randy Hawes]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mission Junction (HS85-10-22902).jpg|thumb|300px|right|Mission's old CPR train station in 1910]]\nThe Town of Mission City began as a land promotion. The town's core commercial properties and residential streets were auctioned off through [[James Welton Horne|James Horne's]] auction, the \"Great Land Sale\" May 19, 1891<ref>https://missionmuseum.com/local-history/the-great-land-sale/</ref>, with buyers brought in via the CPR mainline from Vancouver as well as from Eastern Canada. Soon afterwards, Harry Brown French, an American from New York, came to the city and founded the [[Mission Regional Chamber of Commerce]] on June 19, 1893.<ref name=\"Old Document\">\"Old Document Reveals Board Founded in '93\", ''[[The Fraser Valley Record]]'', Mission, BC, Canada, 19 April 1945.</ref> It was the first [[Board of Trade]] in B.C.\"<ref name=\"First Board\">Kask, Glen. \"First board of trade in B.C.\", ''[[The Fraser Valley Record]]'', Mission, BC, Canada, 16 June 1993.</ref> Some of the early houses and commercial buildings were, in fact, specifically designed to be reminiscent of small towns in southern Ontario in order to encourage buyers. Hailed at the time as a new metropolis, the fledgling town's location at the junction of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] mainline with a northward extension of the [[Burlington Northern Railroad]] brought name suggestions that included East Vancouver and North Seattle. The name Mission City was chosen due to the site's proximity to the historic [[St. Mary's Indian Residential School|St. Mary's Mission]] of the [[Oblate (religion)|Oblate]] order just east of town, which was founded in 1868 (now the [[Peckquaylis Indian Reserve]]).\n\nAt the time of founding, the swing-span [[Mission Railway Bridge]] opened in 1891 was the only crossing of the Fraser River in the Fraser Valley below the [[Alexandra Bridge (Trans-Canada)|Alexandra Bridge]], and all rail traffic between Vancouver and the United States was necessarily routed through Mission until the [[New Westminster Bridge]] at [[New Westminster]] was built in 1904. The rail bridge at Mission doubled duty as a one-way alternating vehicular bridge until 1973, when a long-promised new [[Mission Bridge]] was finally completed. The bridge's location is geographically important at the head of the tidal bore on the Fraser River, and its water level gauge is an important measure of the Fraser's annual and sometimes dangerously large spring [[freshet]].\n\n[[File:Sir Wilfrid Laurier at Mission City, British Columbia (HS85-10-22903).jpg|thumb|left|Prime Minister Sir [[Wilfrid Laurier]] visiting Mission City, 1910]]\nMission City's original retail core was in the small area of lowland between the CPR mainline and the river. Following the great flood of 1894 a few years after the town's founding, the core was relocated just north of the rail line at the foot of the hillside rising above the rail junction. This small commercial strip, originally named Washington Avenue, later Main Street and since the 1980s called First Avenue, is only four or five blocks long and was one of the principal commercial centres of the Fraser Valley for many decades and had a lively retail trade and social life.  Following the 1894 flood, abandoned buildings and lots in the old downtown were taken over by Chinese merchants and workers, creating a Chinatown which lasted until the 1920s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.missionmuseum.com/ |title=From public display at the Mission Museum |publisher=Missionmuseum.com |date=2012-04-14 |accessdate=2012-05-25}}</ref>\n\nThe western part of the district, the [[Stave Valley]], is largely rural and forested but its watercourse is home to what was the largest hydroelectric project in British Columbia until the [[Bridge River Power Project]] opened in 1961. It was built by the [[British Columbia Electric Railway]] (BCER) to provide power to the electric street railway and interurban system in Vancouver. The [[Stave Falls Power Co.]] operated a light-gauge railway for passenger and freight service up the lower canyon of the river to the [[Stave Falls Dam|dam]] at [[Stave Falls]]. During the construction of the [[Ruskin Dam]] (completed 1931) the railway was rebuilt at a higher elevation so as to skirt the new Hayward Lake reservoir. The rail line has long been discontinued, but the old grade and its trestles are now part of a recreation trail circling the reservoir.\n\nFlanking the outraces of the powerhouse at Stave Falls there was once a fairly large community (300 houses), which was served by the railway via connections to the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] line at [[Ruskin, British Columbia|Ruskin]], although the (then very rough) Dewdney Trunk Road used the dam to cross the [[Stave River]]. Population in the Stave Falls area is now away from the dams, west along the Dewdney Trunk towards Maple Ridge, in a rural farm-and-wilderness area south of [[Rolley Lake Provincial Park]].\n\nUp against the Maple Ridge boundary near the waterfront on the west side of the Stave, and halfway between the dam and the mills at Ruskin, was a large drive-in theatre for many years. It is now a large trailer park, and the most populated of Ruskin's neighbourhoods.\n\nThe building of the Highway 1 freeway on the south side of the Fraser in the early 1960s brought huge population growth and large shopping malls to formerly rural Abbotsford, Matsqui, Sumas and Langley; as a result Mission lost its \"anchor\", the main Eaton's department store in the Valley, and the town's Main Street businesses lost much of their business to the new shopping malls a few minutes away across the river. This process was accelerated with the opening of the new bridge in the mid-1970s.\n\n[[File:Mission Post Office British Columbia Canada.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Mission Post Office, First Avenue at Welton Avenue in the heart of Mission's commercial core]]Despite a cohesive business community and new retail malls on the edges of the old core, Mission's retail community has never regained its former prominence in the [[Fraser Valley]]. Burgeoning \"[[Commuter town|exurban]]\" population growth connected with the rapid growth of the population of the [[Lower Mainland]] and encouraged by a new [[commuter rail]] line direct to downtown Vancouver, the [[West Coast Express]], has reversed this trend.\nOutside of the core \"urban\" area, most of which had been the Town of Mission City, the former District of Mission was a collection of distinct rural communities, each with their own history and sometimes distinct ethnic flavour. Silverdale, 7 kilometres west of Mission on the east bank of the lower Stave River, was homesteaded in the 1880s by Italian immigrants (including the Gagliardi family); their descendants reside there to this day. Neighbouring Silverhill was founded by a Finnish Utopian sect who were superseded by Scandinavian and German settlers following a forest fire that virtually wiped out the Finns.\n\nSteelhead, in the northern part of the district, was originally a weekend retreat for some of Vancouver's press community. Other localities such as Ferndale, Cedar Valley and Hatzic were farming communities of mixed origin, with Europeans and anglicized French-Canadians alongside the usual English-Scottish Canadian mix typical of much of the Fraser Valley. Throughout the Mission area before [[World War II]], there was a large Japanese-Canadian population involved in berry farming, logging and milling and in the fishery on the river.\n\n[[File:Seminary of Christ the King & Westminster Abbey, Mission, BC 01.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Westminster Abbey]]In 1954, [[Benedictine]] [[monk]]s obtained land near Mission, where they set up their [[Westminster Abbey (British Columbia)|Westminster Abbey]] and Seminary of Christ the King. They have lived there ever since, running their own farm and teaching high school and college men at the seminary.\n\nThe berry industry, formerly the district's largest and most important, formed the heart of the town's annual summer party, the Strawberry Festival. The Strawberry Festival began in 1946, when it was suggested by the Board of Trade. But with the impacts on this industry ([[Japanese Canadian Internment|relocation]] of the Japanese during wartime and the devastating [[Fraser River#Flooding|flood]] of 1948), the strawberry theme was abandoned. The town acquired the rights to the Western Canada championships of the [[Soap Box Derby]], which were held annually in a specially built facility until 1973; the Derby has been revived in the new millennium.\n\nMission's other major industry was logging, and the town's several mills were noted for being the world's largest suppliers of red cedar [[shake (shingle)|shake]]s and shingles. The District of Mission has operated for many years its own [[tree farm]], covering most of its northern and northwestern mountainous forests. This tree farm served as a model for silvicultural management on a larger scale throughout British Columbia as well as provided a unique income source for the municipality. From 1967 through the 1970s the Soap Box Derby shared [[Dominion Day]] with a large [[Loggers Sports]] event, one of the largest in British Columbia and important on the [[North American Loggers Sports Association]] circuit.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s there was a large cluster of productive mills on the waterfront in Mission, for many years world capital of red cedar shake production (the mill at [[Whonnock, British Columbia|Whonnock]] outproduced the largest of the Mission mills, but Mission's city of mills was the largest overall producer). Nearby Eddy Match Co., between Mission and Hatzic, was the largest matchstick-making plant in the world until it closed in the 1960s; its only rival was in [[Hull, Quebec]].\n\nAdjoining it was the Empress Foods Co. cannery, the survivor of the struggles of the berry industry in the Central Fraser Valley, and dating from the days of Mission's supremacy as strawberry capital of the valley before the 1948 [[Fraser River]] flood wiped it out. In more recent times one of these buildings was for a while converted into the province's largest [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] [[grow-op]], in a scandal involving one of the town's wealthiest families.\n\nMission is noted as the home of a long-established professional dragstrip, [[Mission Raceway Park]], which was moved in relatively recent times outside the dyking of the lower part of town to reduce noise in residential and commercial areas nearby.\n\nIn 1972 a large tract of land in central Mission's Ferndale area, flat upland at the top of the slope above downtown, was acquired by the federal government and developed into two large penal facilities. One is a [[Ferndale Institution|minimum]] security facility, and the other is a [[Mission Institution|medium security]] prison. The northern part of the district, and the wilds of the Stave River basin to the north of it, are home to a few wilderness work camps for young offenders and low-risk convicts; these camps have over recent decades participated in the ongoing clearing of vast forests of flooded-out trees from the inundated areas of [[Stave Lake]], opening the lake to water recreation and public exploration.\n\n==Economy==\nHistorically, [[forestry]], hydroelectricity and agriculture were Mission's chief resource sectors and provided the basis for varied related retail and service activities. In recent history, transportation improvements have enabled the manufacturing sector to expand beyond sawmilling and food processing.\n\nForest and wood related industries dominate the manufacturing sector, with an emphasis on [[Western Redcedar|redcedar]] shake and shingle mills. Mission also holds the only municipal tree farm license in British Columbia.\n\n[[Agriculture]] is mostly restricted to a narrow belt along the Fraser River, and the unincorporated Dewdney-Deroche district east of Mission contains the majority of the farms in the area. There are about 96 commercial and hobby farms in the area. Dairy is the chief agricultural enterprise; other income sources include poultry, hogs, beef and vegetables.\n\nMission's largest employer is the local school district, School District #75, and its second largest employer is the District (i.e. the municipality) itself.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Mission City railway station (5993731063).jpg|thumb|left|The West Coast Express station in 2011]]\nTransportation infrastructure includes [[British Columbia Highway 11|Abbotsford-Mission Highway 11]], and the [[British Columbia Highway 7|Lougheed Highway 7]]. Mission is also accessible through commuter rail, the [[West Coast Express]], which runs five trains in each direction a day, five days a week, between [[Vancouver]] and [[Mission City Station]].  Bus service in Mission is served by the [[Central Fraser Valley Transit System]] connecting with the [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|City of Abbotsford]], as well as [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]] with service to [[Coquitlam Central Station]] via route 701.\nThree days per week [[Via Rail]]'s ''[[The Canadian]]'' provides eastbound flag stop service from [[Mission Harbour railway station]].\n\nMission differs from some of the other Fraser Valley communities because of its access to the Fraser River. The Fraser near Mission is for the most part undeveloped and unspoiled which makes Mission the launch point for many water based activities that happen year round.

Organizations established in Mission included the  Japanese Farmer's Association (Nokai), established in 1916; the Mission Judo Club; the Mission Buddhist Church; and a Japanese Language School.

territories of Canada|province]] of [[British Columbia]], Canada.  It was incorporated as a district municipality in 1892, growing to include additional villages and rural areas over the years, adding the original Town of '''Mission City''', long an independent core of the region, in 1969.\n\nIt is situated on the north bank of the [[Fraser River]], backing onto mountains and lakes overlooking the [[Fraser Valley|Central Fraser Valley]], {{convert|80|km|miles|abbr=on}} east-southeast of [[Vancouver]], British Columbia.\n\n==Geography==\nUnlike the other [[Fraser Valley]] municipalities, Mission is mostly forested upland with only small floodplains lining the shore of the Fraser River. Some benches of farmland rise in succession northwards above the core developed area of the city. Mission was once the heart of the berry industry in the Fraser Valley, with \"Home of the Big Red Strawberry\" as Mission's slogan in the 1930s and into the 1940s.\n\nThe more southerly portion of the municipality is bounded on the west by the lower reaches of the [[Stave River]], which consists mostly of the lakewaters of two hydroelectric reservoirs, [[Stave Lake]] and [[Hayward Lake]]. Although the vast majority of the population of Mission lives well to the east of the Stave, over 50% of the northern land area of the municipality is west and north of that river; its extreme northwest corner is on the far side of upper [[Alouette Lake]]. A small portion of the lower Stave still runs free in its last two miles before its confluence with the [[Fraser River|Fraser]] at [[Ruskin, British Columbia|Ruskin]]; its last three-quarters of a mile forms the border with the larger municipality of [[Maple Ridge, British Columbia|Maple Ridge]] to the west.\n\n[[File:Snow-capped mountain.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Mount Robie Reid lies just past Mission's northern boundary.]]Over 40% of Mission is actually tree farm, making it only one of two communities with municipal [[tree farm]]s. (Revelstoke BC, with a much smaller and newer farm, is the second.) Mission's tree farm celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2008.  It comprises much of the northern part of the district, including the area west of the Stave River, up to the district's northern boundary near the foot of [[Mount Robie Reid]]; a small sliver of Mission District is at the head of [[Alouette Lake]] (normally thought of as being in Maple Ridge).\n\nThe eastern boundary of the municipality roughly coincides with the division between the Mission upland and the alluvial floodplain of Hatzic Prairie, which resembles much of the rest of the Fraser Valley Lowland. The unincorporated communities from Hatzic eastwards through [[Dewdney, British Columbia|Dewdney]] and [[Nicomen Island]] to [[Deroche, British Columbia|Deroche]] are part of the social and commercial matrix centred on Mission but have never joined the municipality, as is also the case with areas north of Hatzic and Dewdney such as [[McConnell Creek, British Columbia|McConnell Creek]] and [[Durieu, British Columbia|Durieu]]; the local economy and societies are built on dairy, berry and corn farming as well as a large [[First Nations]] community at the Indian Reserves of the [[Leq' a: mel First Nation]], formerly known as the Lakahahmen First Nation, on [[Nicomen Island]] and [[Deroche, British Columbia|Deroche]].\n\n==Government==\nMission was incorporated in 1892 and is {{convert|225.78|km2|abbr=on}} in size. In 1922 the District of Mission was partitioned by the creation of the Village of Mission, which later became the Village of Mission City, then the Town of Mission City, until amalgamated with the District by plebiscite in 1969.\n\nThe District of Mission uses the current Council-Manager system of local government. The present Mayor and Council, was elected on November 15, 2018. The current mayor is [[Pam Alexis]]. A notable past mayor is [[Randy Hawes]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mission Junction (HS85-10-22902).jpg|thumb|300px|right|Mission's old CPR train station in 1910]]\nThe Town of Mission City began as a land promotion. The town's core commercial properties and residential streets were auctioned off through [[James Welton Horne|James Horne's]] auction, the \"Great Land Sale\" May 19, 1891<ref>https://missionmuseum.com/local-history/the-great-land-sale/</ref>, with buyers brought in via the CPR mainline from Vancouver as well as from Eastern Canada. Soon afterwards, Harry Brown French, an American from New York, came to the city and founded the [[Mission Regional Chamber of Commerce]] on June 19, 1893.<ref name=\"Old Document\">\"Old Document Reveals Board Founded in '93\", ''[[The Fraser Valley Record]]'', Mission, BC, Canada, 19 April 1945.</ref> It was the first [[Board of Trade]] in B.C.\"<ref name=\"First Board\">Kask, Glen. \"First board of trade in B.C.\", ''[[The Fraser Valley Record]]'', Mission, BC, Canada, 16 June 1993.</ref> Some of the early houses and commercial buildings were, in fact, specifically designed to be reminiscent of small towns in southern Ontario in order to encourage buyers. Hailed at the time as a new metropolis, the fledgling town's location at the junction of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] mainline with a northward extension of the [[Burlington Northern Railroad]] brought name suggestions that included East Vancouver and North Seattle. The name Mission City was chosen due to the site's proximity to the historic [[St. Mary's Indian Residential School|St. Mary's Mission]] of the [[Oblate (religion)|Oblate]] order just east of town, which was founded in 1868 (now the [[Peckquaylis Indian Reserve]]).\n\nAt the time of founding, the swing-span [[Mission Railway Bridge]] opened in 1891 was the only crossing of the Fraser River in the Fraser Valley below the [[Alexandra Bridge (Trans-Canada)|Alexandra Bridge]], and all rail traffic between Vancouver and the United States was necessarily routed through Mission until the [[New Westminster Bridge]] at [[New Westminster]] was built in 1904. The rail bridge at Mission doubled duty as a one-way alternating vehicular bridge until 1973, when a long-promised new [[Mission Bridge]] was finally completed. The bridge's location is geographically important at the head of the tidal bore on the Fraser River, and its water level gauge is an important measure of the Fraser's annual and sometimes dangerously large spring [[freshet]].\n\n[[File:Sir Wilfrid Laurier at Mission City, British Columbia (HS85-10-22903).jpg|thumb|left|Prime Minister Sir [[Wilfrid Laurier]] visiting Mission City, 1910]]\nMission City's original retail core was in the small area of lowland between the CPR mainline and the river. Following the great flood of 1894 a few years after the town's founding, the core was relocated just north of the rail line at the foot of the hillside rising above the rail junction. This small commercial strip, originally named Washington Avenue, later Main Street and since the 1980s called First Avenue, is only four or five blocks long and was one of the principal commercial centres of the Fraser Valley for many decades and had a lively retail trade and social life.  Following the 1894 flood, abandoned buildings and lots in the old downtown were taken over by Chinese merchants and workers, creating a Chinatown which lasted until the 1920s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.missionmuseum.com/ |title=From public display at the Mission Museum |publisher=Missionmuseum.com |date=2012-04-14 |accessdate=2012-05-25}}</ref>\n\nThe western part of the district, the [[Stave Valley]], is largely rural and forested but its watercourse is home to what was the largest hydroelectric project in British Columbia until the [[Bridge River Power Project]] opened in 1961. It was built by the [[British Columbia Electric Railway]] (BCER) to provide power to the electric street railway and interurban system in Vancouver. The [[Stave Falls Power Co.]] operated a light-gauge railway for passenger and freight service up the lower canyon of the river to the [[Stave Falls Dam|dam]] at [[Stave Falls]]. During the construction of the [[Ruskin Dam]] (completed 1931) the railway was rebuilt at a higher elevation so as to skirt the new Hayward Lake reservoir. The rail line has long been discontinued, but the old grade and its trestles are now part of a recreation trail circling the reservoir.\n\nFlanking the outraces of the powerhouse at Stave Falls there was once a fairly large community (300 houses), which was served by the railway via connections to the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] line at [[Ruskin, British Columbia|Ruskin]], although the (then very rough) Dewdney Trunk Road used the dam to cross the [[Stave River]]. Population in the Stave Falls area is now away from the dams, west along the Dewdney Trunk towards Maple Ridge, in a rural farm-and-wilderness area south of [[Rolley Lake Provincial Park]].\n\nUp against the Maple Ridge boundary near the waterfront on the west side of the Stave, and halfway between the dam and the mills at Ruskin, was a large drive-in theatre for many years. It is now a large trailer park, and the most populated of Ruskin's neighbourhoods.\n\nThe building of the Highway 1 freeway on the south side of the Fraser in the early 1960s brought huge population growth and large shopping malls to formerly rural Abbotsford, Matsqui, Sumas and Langley; as a result Mission lost its \"anchor\", the main Eaton's department store in the Valley, and the town's Main Street businesses lost much of their business to the new shopping malls a few minutes away across the river. This process was accelerated with the opening of the new bridge in the mid-1970s.\n\n[[File:Mission Post Office British Columbia Canada.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Mission Post Office, First Avenue at Welton Avenue in the heart of Mission's commercial core]]Despite a cohesive business community and new retail malls on the edges of the old core, Mission's retail community has never regained its former prominence in the [[Fraser Valley]]. Burgeoning \"[[Commuter town|exurban]]\" population growth connected with the rapid growth of the population of the [[Lower Mainland]] and encouraged by a new [[commuter rail]] line direct to downtown Vancouver, the [[West Coast Express]], has reversed this trend.\nOutside of the core \"urban\" area, most of which had been the Town of Mission City, the former District of Mission was a collection of distinct rural communities, each with their own history and sometimes distinct ethnic flavour. Silverdale, 7 kilometres west of Mission on the east bank of the lower Stave River, was homesteaded in the 1880s by Italian immigrants (including the Gagliardi family); their descendants reside there to this day. Neighbouring Silverhill was founded by a Finnish Utopian sect who were superseded by Scandinavian and German settlers following a forest fire that virtually wiped out the Finns.\n\nSteelhead, in the northern part of the district, was originally a weekend retreat for some of Vancouver's press community. Other localities such as Ferndale, Cedar Valley and Hatzic were farming communities of mixed origin, with Europeans and anglicized French-Canadians alongside the usual English-Scottish Canadian mix typical of much of the Fraser Valley. Throughout the Mission area before [[World War II]], there was a large Japanese-Canadian population involved in berry farming, logging and milling and in the fishery on the river.\n\n[[File:Seminary of Christ the King & Westminster Abbey, Mission, BC 01.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Westminster Abbey]]In 1954, [[Benedictine]] [[monk]]s obtained land near Mission, where they set up their [[Westminster Abbey (British Columbia)|Westminster Abbey]] and Seminary of Christ the King. They have lived there ever since, running their own farm and teaching high school and college men at the seminary.\n\nThe berry industry, formerly the district's largest and most important, formed the heart of the town's annual summer party, the Strawberry Festival. The Strawberry Festival began in 1946, when it was suggested by the Board of Trade. But with the impacts on this industry ([[Japanese Canadian Internment|relocation]] of the Japanese during wartime and the devastating [[Fraser River#Flooding|flood]] of 1948), the strawberry theme was abandoned. The town acquired the rights to the Western Canada championships of the [[Soap Box Derby]], which were held annually in a specially built facility until 1973; the Derby has been revived in the new millennium.\n\nMission's other major industry was logging, and the town's several mills were noted for being the world's largest suppliers of red cedar [[shake (shingle)|shake]]s and shingles. The District of Mission has operated for many years its own [[tree farm]], covering most of its northern and northwestern mountainous forests. This tree farm served as a model for silvicultural management on a larger scale throughout British Columbia as well as provided a unique income source for the municipality. From 1967 through the 1970s the Soap Box Derby shared [[Dominion Day]] with a large [[Loggers Sports]] event, one of the largest in British Columbia and important on the [[North American Loggers Sports Association]] circuit.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s there was a large cluster of productive mills on the waterfront in Mission, for many years world capital of red cedar shake production (the mill at [[Whonnock, British Columbia|Whonnock]] outproduced the largest of the Mission mills, but Mission's city of mills was the largest overall producer). Nearby Eddy Match Co., between Mission and Hatzic, was the largest matchstick-making plant in the world until it closed in the 1960s; its only rival was in [[Hull, Quebec]].\n\nAdjoining it was the Empress Foods Co. cannery, the survivor of the struggles of the berry industry in the Central Fraser Valley, and dating from the days of Mission's supremacy as strawberry capital of the valley before the 1948 [[Fraser River]] flood wiped it out. In more recent times one of these buildings was for a while converted into the province's largest [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] [[grow-op]], in a scandal involving one of the town's wealthiest families.\n\nMission is noted as the home of a long-established professional dragstrip, [[Mission Raceway Park]], which was moved in relatively recent times outside the dyking of the lower part of town to reduce noise in residential and commercial areas nearby.\n\nIn 1972 a large tract of land in central Mission's Ferndale area, flat upland at the top of the slope above downtown, was acquired by the federal government and developed into two large penal facilities. One is a [[Ferndale Institution|minimum]] security facility, and the other is a [[Mission Institution|medium security]] prison. The northern part of the district, and the wilds of the Stave River basin to the north of it, are home to a few wilderness work camps for young offenders and low-risk convicts; these camps have over recent decades participated in the ongoing clearing of vast forests of flooded-out trees from the inundated areas of [[Stave Lake]], opening the lake to water recreation and public exploration.\n\n==Economy==\nHistorically, [[forestry]], hydroelectricity and agriculture were Mission's chief resource sectors and provided the basis for varied related retail and service activities. In recent history, transportation improvements have enabled the manufacturing sector to expand beyond sawmilling and food processing.\n\nForest and wood related industries dominate the manufacturing sector, with an emphasis on [[Western Redcedar|redcedar]] shake and shingle mills. Mission also holds the only municipal tree farm license in British Columbia.\n\n[[Agriculture]] is mostly restricted to a narrow belt along the Fraser River, and the unincorporated Dewdney-Deroche district east of Mission contains the majority of the farms in the area. There are about 96 commercial and hobby farms in the area. Dairy is the chief agricultural enterprise; other income sources include poultry, hogs, beef and vegetables.\n\nMission's largest employer is the local school district, School District #75, and its second largest employer is the District (i.e. the municipality) itself.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Mission City railway station (5993731063).jpg|thumb|left|The West Coast Express station in 2011]]\nTransportation infrastructure includes [[British Columbia Highway 11|Abbotsford-Mission Highway 11]], and the [[British Columbia Highway 7|Lougheed Highway 7]]. Mission is also accessible through commuter rail, the [[West Coast Express]], which runs five trains in each direction a day, five days a week, between [[Vancouver]] and [[Mission City Station]].  Bus service in Mission is served by the [[Central Fraser Valley Transit System]] connecting with the [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|City of Abbotsford]], as well as [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]] with service to [[Coquitlam Central Station]] via route 701.\nThree days per week [[Via Rail]]'s ''[[The Canadian]]'' provides eastbound flag stop service from [[Mission Harbour railway station]].\n\nMission differs from some of the other Fraser Valley communities because of its access to the Fraser River. The Fraser near Mission is for the most part undeveloped and unspoiled which makes Mission the launch point for many water based activities that happen year round. Boat tours run from Mission's docks on Harbour Avenue, which are also home to sport and commercial fishing vessels; the Fraser has famous salmon runs and population of [[green sturgeon]].\n\n[[File:Missionbridge.jpg|thumb|300px|The Mission Bridge is used by Highway 11.  Following this bridge's opening much of the town's retail business was lost to Abbotsford.]]\n\n==Climate==\nMission has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb'') due to its proximity to the Pacific Ocean. Mission has plentiful rainfall all year round though with a drying trend in summer.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Mission\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 15.6\n|Feb record high C = 20.6\n|Mar record high C = 22.5\n|Apr record high C = 28.0\n|May record high C = 36.5\n|Jun record high C = 36.0\n|Jul record high C = 37.8\n|Aug record high C = 36.5\n|Sep record high C = 36.0\n|Oct record high C = 27.0\n|Nov record high C = 18.9\n|Dec record high C = 17.5\n|year record high C = 37.8\n|Jan high C = 5.1\n|Feb high C = 8.0\n|Mar high C = 10.9\n|Apr high C = 14.6\n|May high C = 17.4\n|Jun high C = 19.9\n|Jul high C = 23.5\n|Aug high C = 23.4\n|Sep high C = 20.9\n|Oct high C = 14.9\n|Nov high C = 8.9\n|Dec high C = 6.0\n|year high C = 14.5\n|Jan mean C = 2.5\n|Feb mean C = 4.7\n|Mar mean C = 6.8\n|Apr mean C = 9.7\n|May mean C = 12.6\n|Jun mean C = 15.1\n|Jul mean C = 17.9\n|Aug mean C = 18.0\n|Sep mean C = 15.6\n|Oct mean C = 10.9\n|Nov mean C = 6.1\n|Dec mean C = 3.5\n|year mean C = 10.3\n|Jan low C = \u22120.2\n|Feb low C = 1.3\n|Mar low C = 2.7\n|Apr low C = 4.8\n|May low C = 7.7\n|Jun low C = 10.3\n|Jul low C = 12.3\n|Aug low C = 12.5\n|Sep low C = 10.4\n|Oct low C = 6.7\n|Nov low C = 3.2\n|Dec low C = 0.9\n|year low C = 6.1\n|Jan record low C = \u221214.4\n|Feb record low C = \u221215.5\n|Mar record low C = \u221212.2\n|Apr record low C = \u22122.8\n|May record low C = \u22122.2\n|Jun record low C = 2.2\n|Jul record low C = 4.4\n|Aug record low C = 5.0\n|Sep record low C = 0.6\n|Oct record low C = \u22123.5\n|Nov record low C = \u221213.3\n|Dec record low C = \u221219.4\n|year record low C = \u221219.4\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 217.0\n|Feb precipitation mm = 190.7\n|Mar precipitation mm = 154.6\n|Apr precipitation mm = 129.7\n|May precipitation mm = 102.5\n|Jun precipitation mm = 100.6\n|Jul precipitation mm = 63.6\n|Aug precipitation mm = 74.1\n|Sep precipitation mm = 77.9\n|Oct precipitation mm = 141.2\n|Nov precipitation mm = 252.7\n|Dec precipitation mm = 260.1\n|year precipitation mm = 1764.5\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 197.3\n|Feb rain mm = 178.8\n|Mar rain mm = 151.2\n|Apr rain mm = 129.5\n|May rain mm = 102.5\n|Jun rain mm = 100.6\n|Jul rain mm = 63.6\n|Aug rain mm = 74.0\n|Sep rain mm = 77.9\n|Oct rain mm = 141.1\n|Nov rain mm = 249.1\n|Dec rain mm = 242.9\n|year rain mm = 1708.5\n|Jan snow cm = 19.7\n|Feb snow cm = 11.9\n|Mar snow cm = 3.4\n|Apr snow cm = 0.2\n|May snow cm = 0\n|Jun snow cm = 0\n|Jul snow cm = 0\n|Aug snow cm = 0\n|Sep snow cm = 0\n|Oct snow cm = 0.1\n|Nov snow cm = 3.6\n|Dec snow cm = 17.2\n|year snow cm = 56.0\n|unit precipitation days= 0.2 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 19.3\n|Feb precipitation days = 16.9\n|Mar precipitation days = 18.0\n|Apr precipitation days = 15.0\n|May precipitation days = 15.6\n|Jun precipitation days = 14.4\n|Jul precipitation days = 9.7\n|Aug precipitation days = 9.6\n|Sep precipitation days = 9.8\n|Oct precipitation days = 15.4\n|Nov precipitation days = 20.7\n|Dec precipitation days = 21.6\n|year precipitation days= 186.0\n|unit rain days= 0.2 mm\n|Jan rain days = 17.3\n|Feb rain days = 15.8\n|Mar rain days = 17.6\n|Apr rain days = 15.0\n|May rain days = 15.6\n|Jun rain days = 14.4\n|Jul rain days = 9.7\n|Aug rain days = 9.6\n|Sep rain days = 9.8\n|Oct rain days = 15.4\n|Nov rain days = 20.4\n|Dec rain days = 19.5\n|year rain days= 180.1\n|unit snow days= 0.2 cm\n|Jan snow days = 4.2\n|Feb snow days = 2.3\n|Mar snow days = 1.1\n|Apr snow days = 0.17\n|May snow days = 0.03\n|Jun snow days = 0\n|Jul snow days = 0\n|Aug snow days = 0\n|Sep snow days = 0\n|Oct snow days = 0.06\n|Nov snow days = 0.82\n|Dec snow days = 3.7\n|year snow days= 12.4\n|source 1 = [[Environment Canada]]<ref name=\"climate\">[[Environment Canada]]\u2014[http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=809&lang=e&dCode=0&province=BC&provBut=Search&month1=0&month2=12 Canadian Climate Normals 1971\u20132000], accessed 24 November 2012</ref>\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\nMission offers few jobs, so many residents (more than 6 out of 10) commute to work in other locales.

Many ''[[issei]]'', or first time immigrants, included prospective farmers and \"picture brides\", or women who communicated with suitors through the mail for the purpose of marriage. Organizations established in Mission included the  Japanese Farmer's Association (Nokai), established in 1916; the Mission Judo Club; the Mission Buddhist Church; and a Japanese Language School.

The World War II-era [[Japanese Canadian internment]] disrupted Mission's ethnic Japanese community as their properties were confiscated, and productivity decreased as the farms were managed by their new non-Japanese.

This season saw Nadal suffer from injuries that included a back injury, a wrist injury, and appendicitis. After losing in the final of the [[2014 Australian Open|Australian Open]] where he suffered from a back injury, Nadal failed to defend his titles at [[2013 BNP Paribas Open|Indian Wells]], [[2013 Barcelona Open Banco Sabadell|Barcelona]], and [[2013 Internazionali BNL d'Italia|Rome]]. He rebounded by claiming his 9th [[2014 French Open|French Open]]. Prior to the North American hardcourt season, Nadal would experience another injury, this time a wrist injury which forced him to withdraw from the [[2014 Rogers Cup|Rogers Cup]], the [[2014 Western & Southern Open|Western & Southern Open]] and the [[2014 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] where he was the defending champion. Nadal announced on 24 October that he would not be competing for rest of the season due to appendicitis and eventually underwent surgery.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/29755595 BBSSport:Rafael Nadal: 14-time Grand Slam winner confirms his season is over]</ref> Despite an injury plagued season, Nadal still ended the year at No. 3 with four titles.\n\n==Year summary==\n\n===Early hard court season and Australian Open===\n\n====Qatar Open====\nRafael Nadal won the title at [[2014 Qatar ExxonMobil Open|2014 Qatar Open]] after defeating [[Ga\u00ebl Monfils]] in the final on January 4.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/25606655 BBC Sport:Rafael Nadal beats Gael Monfils to win Qatar title]</ref>\n\n====Australian Open====\nNadal reached his third final Down Under by dispatching his old rival [[Roger Federer]] in the semi-finals with a straight set victory and by dropping only one set on the way, against [[Grigor Dimitrov]] in the quarter-finals. Victory in the final would have seen Nadal equal [[Pete Sampras]]'s total of 14 major titles and also become only the third man to win all four grand slams at least twice, [[Roy Emerson]] and [[Rod Laver]] being the other two. In the final, though, he was unexpectedly beaten by [[Stanislas Wawrinka]], who had previously never beaten Nadal or even won a set against him in 12 previous meetings. At a set and a break down, Nadal sustained a back injury that saw him swiftly lose the second set. He recovered enough to win the third and fought hard before Wawrinka prevailed in four sets.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/25893279</ref>\n\n====Rio Open====\nNadal won the inaugural Rio Open after beating [[Alexandr Dolgopolov]] in the final on February 23. In the semifinal a day earlier, he had to save two match points in the 3rd set tie breaker to win against [[Pablo And\u00fajar]].\n\n====Indian Wells Masters====\nNadal next competed in the Indian Wells Masters. He received a bye in the first round and fought back from a set down to overcome [[Radek Stepanek]] in the second round. His tournament ended in the next round, though, as [[Alexandr Dolgopolov]] exacted a measure of revenge for his Rio Open final loss by dispatching Nadal in a third set tie break.\n\n====Miami Masters====\nAfter not competing in 2013, Nadal returned to Key Biscane for a chance at his first Miami Masters title. He dominated his first three opponents, losing a total of nine games combined. He then fought back from a set down to overcome [[Milos Raonic]] in the quarter-finals. In an unprecedented event both [[Novak Djokovic]] and he received walkovers from their semi-final opponents to set up their 40th clash. It was Nadal's fourth Miami final, following runner-up finishes in 2005, 2008, and 2011. Nadal would once again fail to lift the trophy, though, as Djokovic displayed near perfect form and eased his way to a two-set victory.\n\n===Spring clay court season and French Open===\n\n====Monte-Carlo Masters====\nAfter finally relinquishing his Monte-Carlo crown to [[Novak Djokovic]] in 2013, Nadal returned to the red clay in an attempt to reclaim the title that had been his from 2005\u20132012. As expected the King of Clay won his first two matches with ease. His victory against [[Andreas Seppi]] in the third round brought his career clay court wins to 300, a feat achieved by only ten other players. In the quarter-finals, though, Nadal would succumb to the relentless attack of [[David Ferrer]]. It was the first time Ferrer had beaten Nadal on clay in ten years and the first time Nadal failed to reach the Monte-Carlo final since his first stint in the tournament as a qualifier in 2003.\n\n====Barcelona Open====\nNadal hadn't lost a match at the Barcelona Open since 2003 and hadn't lost a set at the tournament since dropping one against [[David Ferrer]] in the 2008 final. These streaks seemed destined to continue and did against his first two opponents, both of whom he dispatched in straight sets. In the quarter-finals, Nadal's set streak ended at 44 when [[Nicolas Almagro]] took the second set of their match in a tight tiebreak. Almagro would also put an end to Nadal's win streak at 41 when he clinched the match by winning the third set as well.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/apr/25/rafael-nadal-barcelona-open-nicolas-almagro Rafael Nadal's Barcelona Open winning streak ended by Nicol\u00e1s Almagro]</ref>\n\n====Madrid Open====\nNadal claimed his fourth Madrid Open crown (third on clay) by defeating [[Kei Nishikori]] in the final. Nadal was down a set and a break in the final when Nishikori began showing signs of injury. This injury aided Nadal as he fought back to win the second set and take a three-game lead in the third before Nishikori retired.\n\n====Italian Open====\nNadal made his ninth final at the Italian Open and was vying for his eighth title, but was beaten in three sets by his rival [[Novak Djokovic]] in the final. In the second round, Nadal played the longest three set match of the year (thus far) by battling [[Gilles Simon]] for 199 minutes. In the third round and quarter-final, he was forced to rally from a set down to claim victory against [[Mikhail Youzhny]] and [[Andy Murray]] respectively. His loss marked the first time in ten years that he would enter into the French Open with fewer than two European clay court titles.\n\n====French Open====\nDespite a sub-par European clay court season, Nadal entered the second [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Major]] of the year with a 59\u20131 record at the event. By the end of the tournament Nadal would extend this record to 66\u20131 by claiming his record fifth consecutive and record ninth French Open title with a four set victory over [[Novak Djokovic]]. He won his first four rounds against [[Robby Ginepri]], [[Dominic Thiem]], [[Leonardo Mayer]], and [[Du\u0161an Lajovi\u0107]], respectively, without dropping a set. In the quarter-finals, he faced last year's finalist, [[David Ferrer]]. He dropped the opening set, his first of the tournament, but went on to win in four sets. In the semi-finals, he put on a devastating display and lost only six games as he dispatched [[Andy Murray]] in straight sets. The final was a rematch of last year's semifinal and the 2012 final as well as his 42nd match against [[Novak Djokovic]]. In winning his 9th Roland Garros title, Nadal became the only player to have won one Grand Slam for ten consecutive years.<ref>http://www.atpworldtour.com/</ref>\n\n===Grass court season and Wimbledon===\n\n====Halle Open====\nNadal received a bye in the first round and then lost to [[Dustin Brown (tennis)|Dustin Brown]] in the second round. The loss marked Nadal's third consecutive defeat on grass and dropped his record on the surface to 2\u20135 since he reached the 2011 Wimbledon final.\n\n====Wimbledon====\nHaving been bounced in the second round by [[Lukas Rosol]] in 2012, the first round by [[Steve Darcis]] in 2013, and riding a three match grass losing streak, Nadal entered the 2014 edition of Wimbledon looking for redemption. His first match started off rocky as he dropped the opening set against [[Martin Kli\u017ean]], but he recovered to win in four and snap his losing streak. Up next was his 2012 conqueror, Rosol. Rosol looked capable of pulling out the upset once again as he led by a set and a break, but Nadal righted the ship and got revenge for his 2012 defeat by pulling the match out in four. Nadal again recovered from a set down against [[Mikhail Kukushkin]] in the third round, marking the first time in his career that he won three consecutive matches after dropping the first set. Nadal went on to face 19-year-old wildcard [[Nick Kyrgios]] in the fourth round and once again dropped the opening set, but was unable to recover this time and succumbed to Kyrgios in four sets. It was Nadal's first defeat to a player born in the 1990s and the first time a teenager had beaten the World No. 1 at a Grand Slam since Nadal himself beat [[Roger Federer]] at the 2005 French Open.\n\n===Summer hard court season===\n\n====Canadian Open, Cincinnati Masters, and US Open====\n\nNadal was the defending champion of all three tournaments, but had to withdraw from each because he was unable to recover from a right wrist injury that he suffered while practicing on July 29.\n\n===Asian Swing===\n\n====China Open====\n\nNadal returned to action from his wrist injury after three months away from the tour with a dominant two set victory over [[Richard Gasquet]]. He won the next round as well, but rust and lack of training became apparent as he fell to [[Martin Klizan]] in the quarters.\n\n====Shanghai Masters====\n\nBefore his opening match, Nadal announced that he had been receiving aggressive medical treatment for appendicitis in hopes of avoiding surgery until the end of the tennis season. The effects of this ailment, though, could be seen in his movement and play in his opening match as [[Feliciano Lopez]] handed him a straight set defeat.\n\n===Indoor hard court season and World Tour Finals===\n\n====Swiss indoors====\n\nNadal seemed to be back to his winning ways as he easily dispatched his first two opponents. In the quarter-finals, though, he ran into red hot 17-year-old [[Borna \u0106ori\u0107]] and was beaten in straight sets.\n\n====Paris Masters and ATP World Tour Finals====\n\nAfter his defeat in Basel, Nadal announced that he was not in a condition to be able to compete at the level necessary to win and opted out of both the Paris Masters and the ATP World Tour Finals to have surgery for his appendicitis. It was the third time that Nadal was forced to withdrew from the ATP World Tour Finals after he had qualified.\n\n==All matches==\n{{performance key}}\n\n===Singles matches===\n{{tennis sm

[[2014 Qatar ExxonMobil Open]]. This season saw Nadal suffer from injuries that included a back injury, a wrist injury, and appendicitis. After losing in the final of the [[2014 Australian Open|Australian Open]] where he suffered from a back injury, Nadal failed to defend his titles at [[2013 BNP Paribas Open|Indian Wells]], [[2013 Barcelona Open Banco Sabadell|Barcelona]], and [[2013 Internazionali BNL d'Italia|Rome]]. He rebounded by claiming his 9th [[2014 French Open|French Open]]. Prior to the North American hardcourt season, Nadal would experience another injury, this time a wrist injury which forced him to withdraw from the [[2014 Rogers Cup|Rogers Cup]], the [[2014 Western & Southern Open|Western & Southern Open]] and the [[2014 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] where he was the defending champion. Nadal announced on 24 October that he would not be competing for rest of the season due to appendicitis and eventually underwent surgery.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/29755595 BBSSport:Rafael Nadal: 14-time Grand Slam winner confirms his season is over]</ref> Despite an injury plagued season, Nadal still ended the year at No. 3 with four titles.\n\n==Year summary==\n\n===Early hard court season and Australian Open===\n\n====Qatar Open====\nRafael Nadal won the title at [[2014 Qatar ExxonMobil Open|2014 Qatar Open]] after defeating [[Ga\u00ebl Monfils]] in the final on January 4.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/25606655 BBC Sport:Rafael Nadal beats Gael Monfils to win Qatar title]</ref>\n\n====Australian Open====\nNadal reached his third final Down Under by dispatching his old rival [[Roger Federer]] in the semi-finals with a straight set victory and by dropping only one set on the way, against [[Grigor Dimitrov]] in the quarter-finals. Victory in the final would have seen Nadal equal [[Pete Sampras]]'s total of 14 major titles and also become only the third man to win all four grand slams at least twice, [[Roy Emerson]] and [[Rod Laver]] being the other two. In the final, though, he was unexpectedly beaten by [[Stanislas Wawrinka]], who had previously never beaten Nadal or even won a set against him in 12 previous meetings. At a set and a break down, Nadal sustained a back injury that saw him swiftly lose the second set. He recovered enough to win the third and fought hard before Wawrinka prevailed in four sets.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/25893279</ref>\n\n====Rio Open====\nNadal won the inaugural Rio Open after beating [[Alexandr Dolgopolov]] in the final on February 23. In the semifinal a day earlier, he had to save two match points in the 3rd set tie breaker to win against [[Pablo And\u00fajar]].\n\n====Indian Wells Masters====\nNadal next competed in the Indian Wells Masters. He received a bye in the first round and fought back from a set down to overcome [[Radek Stepanek]] in the second round. His tournament ended in the next round, though, as [[Alexandr Dolgopolov]] exacted a measure of revenge for his Rio Open final loss by dispatching Nadal in a third set tie break.\n\n====Miami Masters====\nAfter not competing in 2013, Nadal returned to Key Biscane for a chance at his first Miami Masters title. He dominated his first three opponents, losing a total of nine games combined. He then fought back from a set down to overcome [[Milos Raonic]] in the quarter-finals. In an unprecedented event both [[Novak Djokovic]] and he received walkovers from their semi-final opponents to set up their 40th clash. It was Nadal's fourth Miami final, following runner-up finishes in 2005, 2008, and 2011. Nadal would once again fail to lift the trophy, though, as Djokovic displayed near perfect form and eased his way to a two-set victory.\n\n===Spring clay court season and French Open===\n\n====Monte-Carlo Masters====\nAfter finally relinquishing his Monte-Carlo crown to [[Novak Djokovic]] in 2013, Nadal returned to the red clay in an attempt to reclaim the title that had been his from 2005\u20132012. As expected the King of Clay won his first two matches with ease. His victory against [[Andreas Seppi]] in the third round brought his career clay court wins to 300, a feat achieved by only ten other players. In the quarter-finals, though, Nadal would succumb to the relentless attack of [[David Ferrer]]. It was the first time Ferrer had beaten Nadal on clay in ten years and the first time Nadal failed to reach the Monte-Carlo final since his first stint in the tournament as a qualifier in 2003.\n\n====Barcelona Open====\nNadal hadn't lost a match at the Barcelona Open since 2003 and hadn't lost a set at the tournament since dropping one against [[David Ferrer]] in the 2008 final. These streaks seemed destined to continue and did against his first two opponents, both of whom he dispatched in straight sets. In the quarter-finals, Nadal's set streak ended at 44 when [[Nicolas Almagro]] took the second set of their match in a tight tiebreak. Almagro would also put an end to Nadal's win streak at 41 when he clinched the match by winning the third set as well.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/apr/25/rafael-nadal-barcelona-open-nicolas-almagro Rafael Nadal's Barcelona Open winning streak ended by Nicol\u00e1s Almagro]</ref>\n\n====Madrid Open====\nNadal claimed his fourth Madrid Open crown (third on clay) by defeating [[Kei Nishikori]] in the final. Nadal was down a set and a break in the final when Nishikori began showing signs of injury. This injury aided Nadal as he fought back to win the second set and take a three-game lead in the third before Nishikori retired.\n\n====Italian Open====\nNadal made his ninth final at the Italian Open and was vying for his eighth title, but was beaten in three sets by his rival [[Novak Djokovic]] in the final. In the second round, Nadal played the longest three set match of the year (thus far) by battling [[Gilles Simon]] for 199 minutes. In the third round and quarter-final, he was forced to rally from a set down to claim victory against [[Mikhail Youzhny]] and [[Andy Murray]] respectively. His loss marked the first time in ten years that he would enter into the French Open with fewer than two European clay court titles.\n\n====French Open====\nDespite a sub-par European clay court season, Nadal entered the second [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Major]] of the year with a 59\u20131 record at the event. By the end of the tournament Nadal would extend this record to 66\u20131 by claiming his record fifth consecutive and record ninth French Open title with a four set victory over [[Novak Djokovic]]. He won his first four rounds against [[Robby Ginepri]], [[Dominic Thiem]], [[Leonardo Mayer]], and [[Du\u0161an Lajovi\u0107]], respectively, without dropping a set. In the quarter-finals, he faced last year's finalist, [[David Ferrer]]. He dropped the opening set, his first of the tournament, but went on to win in four sets. In the semi-finals, he put on a devastating display and lost only six games as he dispatched [[Andy Murray]] in straight sets. The final was a rematch of last year's semifinal and the 2012 final as well as his 42nd match against [[Novak Djokovic]]. In winning his 9th Roland Garros title, Nadal became the only player to have won one Grand Slam for ten consecutive years.<ref>http://www.atpworldtour.com/</ref>\n\n===Grass court season and Wimbledon===\n\n====Halle Open====\nNadal received a bye in the first round and then lost to [[Dustin Brown (tennis)|Dustin Brown]] in the second round. The loss marked Nadal's third consecutive defeat on grass and dropped his record on the surface to 2\u20135 since he reached the 2011 Wimbledon final.\n\n====Wimbledon====\nHaving been bounced in the second round by [[Lukas Rosol]] in 2012, the first round by [[Steve Darcis]] in 2013, and riding a three match grass losing streak, Nadal entered the 2014 edition of Wimbledon looking for redemption. His first match started off rocky as he dropped the opening set against [[Martin Kli\u017ean]], but he recovered to win in four and snap his losing streak. Up next was his 2012 conqueror, Rosol. Rosol looked capable of pulling out the upset once again as he led by a set and a break, but Nadal righted the ship and got revenge for his 2012 defeat by pulling the match out in four. Nadal again recovered from a set down against [[Mikhail Kukushkin]] in the third round, marking the first time in his career that he won three consecutive matches after dropping the first set. Nadal went on to face 19-year-old wildcard [[Nick Kyrgios]] in the fourth round and once again dropped the opening set, but was unable to recover this time and succumbed to Kyrgios in four sets. It was Nadal's first defeat to a player born in the 1990s and the first time a teenager had beaten the World No. 1 at a Grand Slam since Nadal himself beat [[Roger Federer]] at the 2005 French Open.\n\n===Summer hard court season===\n\n====Canadian Open, Cincinnati Masters, and US Open====\n\nNadal was the defending champion of all three tournaments, but had to withdraw from each because he was unable to recover from a right wrist injury that he suffered while practicing on July 29.\n\n===Asian Swing===\n\n====China Open====\n\nNadal returned to action from his wrist injury after three months away from the tour with a dominant two set victory over [[Richard Gasquet]]. He won the next round as well, but rust and lack of training became apparent as he fell to [[Martin Klizan]] in the quarters.\n\n====Shanghai Masters====\n\nBefore his opening match, Nadal announced that he had been receiving aggressive medical treatment for appendicitis in hopes of avoiding surgery until the end of the tennis season. The effects of this ailment, though, could be seen in his movement and play in his opening match as [[Feliciano Lopez]] handed him a straight set defeat.\n\n===Indoor hard court season and World Tour Finals===\n\n====Swiss indoors====\n\nNadal seemed to be back to his winning ways as he easily dispatched his first two opponents. In the quarter-finals, though, he ran into red hot 17-year-old [[Borna \u0106ori\u0107]] and was beaten in straight sets.\n\n====Paris Masters and ATP World Tour Finals====\n\nAfter his defeat in Basel, Nadal announced that he was not in a condition to be able to compete at the level necessary to win and opted out of both the Paris Masters and the ATP World Tour Finals to have surgery for his appendicitis. It was the third time that Nadal was forced to withdrew from the ATP World Tour Finals after he had qualified.\n\n==All matches==\n{{performance key}}\n\n===Singles matches===\n{{tennis sm

The decisions made by the Administrative Council are monitored by the State, represented by DRASS (''Directions r\u00e9gionales des affaires sanitaires et sociales'', or the regional director for health and social matters).\n\nURSSAF organizations are spread across France to form a network totaling more than one hundred members (101 as of January 1, 2006), with at least one organization per department. The organizations are deemed to be infallible, and without any reference to court and in disregard of any banking conventions, they can take money out of a person's bank account if they believe they are owed it. There are no appeals procedures. {{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nURSSAF is supervised primarily by the Ministry for Social Security and secondarily by the Ministry for the Budget, Public Accounts and Civil Service.\n\nSince May 18, 2007, management of the URSSAF network has been supervised by Xavier Bertrand, the Minister of Labor, Social Affairs and Solidarity, while Eric Woerth, minister for the Budget, Public Accounts and Civil Service, is the acting supervisor for the collection of contributions and other taxes.\n\nThe objectives of ACOSS ({{Interlanguage link multi|Agence centrale des organismes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale|fr}}, or the central agency for social security organizations) have been recorded in three successive COGs (''conventions d'objectifs et de gestion'', or agreements on objectives and management), the first covering the period 1998-2001, the second 2002&ndash;2005, and the current version covering 2006-2009. ACOSS has had to work within the framework of this third COG to lay off 600 employees out of a workforce of 14,500 between now and 2009.\n\nIn [[Overseas department|DOM]]<nowiki/>s (''d\u00e9partements d'outre-mer'', or overseas departments), URSSAF organizations do not exist as such, so social security contributions are collected by the CGSS (''Caisses g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale'', or general social security funds).\n\nACOSS is the national fund for the entire group of organizations (as decreed by the law of July 25, 1994), including the CNAM-TS for health insurance, the CNAF for family benefits and the CNAV for retirement.\n\nACOSS manages the social security budget.\n\n== Sources ==\n* The 2002-2006 COG signed on May 31, 2006, by the Minister

French '''URSSAF''' ('''Unions de Recouvrement des Cotisations de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Sociale et d'Allocations Familiales''', meaning the '''Organizations for the Collection of Social Security and Family Benefit Contributions''') is a network of private organizations created in 1960 whose main task is to collect employee and employer [[social security]] contributions that finance the ''R\u00e9gime general'' (general account) of France's social security system, including state health insurance ({{Interlanguage link multi|Assurance maladie en France|fr}}).\n\n\n[[File:France-urssaf-cotisations-exonerations.svg|thumb|Chart of the Urssaf (the French social welfare collection agencies) incomes and exemptions for the 1998-2007 period, based on

manage two other salary deductions for the French [[Ministry of Public Action and Accounts]]: \n* the [[Generalized Social Contribution]] (''Contribution sociale g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e'', or CSG);\n* the [[Social debt repayment contribution]] (''Contribution au remboursement de la dette sociale'', or CRDS: a contribution for the repayment of the French social security deficit).\n\nURSSAF employees are not, as commonly assumed, [[civil servants]], and thus they are covered by the same employment agreements as other social security employees.\n\nEach organization is a private entity responsible for a particular [[public services|public service]] and is headed by a Director.\n\nEach of them (including the national fund) is controlled by an Administrative Council made up in equal parts of managers and workers. The decisions made by the Administrative Council are monitored by the State, represented by DRASS (''Directions r\u00e9gionales des affaires sanitaires et sociales'', or the regional director for health and social matters).\n\nURSSAF organizations are spread across France to form a network totaling more than one hundred members (101 as of January 1, 2006), with at least one organization per department. The organizations are deemed to be infallible, and without any reference to court and in disregard of any banking conventions, they can take money out of a person's bank account if they believe they are owed it. There are no appeals procedures. {{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nURSSAF is supervised primarily by the Ministry for Social Security and secondarily by the Ministry for the Budget, Public Accounts and Civil Service.\n\nSince May 18, 2007, management of the URSSAF network has been supervised by Xavier Bertrand, the Minister of Labor, Social Affairs and Solidarity, while Eric Woerth, minister for the Budget, Public Accounts and Civil Service, is the acting supervisor for the collection of contributions and other taxes.\n\nThe objectives of ACOSS ({{Interlanguage link multi|Agence centrale des organismes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale|fr}}, or the central agency for social security organizations) have been recorded in three successive COGs (''conventions d'objectifs et de gestion'', or agreements on objectives and management), the first covering the period 1998-2001, the second 2002&ndash;2005, and the current version covering 2006-2009. ACOSS has had to work within the framework of this third COG to lay off 600 employees out of a workforce of 14,500 between now and 2009.\n\nIn [[Overseas department|DOM]]<nowiki/>s (''d\u00e9partements d'outre-mer'', or overseas departments), URSSAF organizations do not exist as such, so social security contributions are collected by the CGSS (''Caisses g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale'', or general social security funds).\n\nACOSS is the national fund for the entire group of organizations (as decreed by the law of July 25, 1994), including the CNAM-TS for health insurance, the CNAF for family benefits and the CNAV for retirement.\n\nACOSS manages the social security budget.\n\n== Sources ==\n* The 2002-2006 COG signed on May 31, 2006, by the Minister of Social Affairs, which expresses the objectives assigned to contribution collections and the need for 600 layoffs.\n* [http://www.acoss.urssaf.fr/index.php?option=com_docman&task=docclick&bid=1042 Press release on the 2006-2009 COG]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.urssaf.fr }}\n\n[[Category:Government of France]]\n", "name_user": "Amrcmln", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URSSAF"}

She performed regularly at the [[Cotton Club (New York City)|Cotton Club]] in [[Harlem]]. Theatrical manager Lou Bolton testified during the ''Kane v. Fleischer'' trial that [[Helen Kane]] saw Baby Esther's [[cabaret]] act in 1928 with him and appropriated Jones' style of singing, changing the interpolated words \"boo-boo-boo\" and \"doo-doo-doo\" to \"boop-boop-a-doop\" in a recording of \"[[I Wanna Be Loved By You]]\". Kane never publicly admitted this. Jones' style, as imitated by Kane, went on to become the inspiration for the voice of the cartoon character [[Betty Boop]].\n\nWhen Kane attempted to sue [[Fleischer Studios]] for using her persona, the studios defended themselves by arguing that Kane herself had taken it from \"Baby Esther\" Jones. An early test sound film of Baby Esther's performance was used as evidence. In court, it was presumed that Jones was still in Paris.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4cQ9DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA175 |page= 175 |first= James D. |last= Taylor Jr. |title= Helen Kane and Betty Boop: On Stage and On Trial |date= 2017 |publisher= Algora |isbn= 9781628942996}}</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\n'''Baby Esther Lee Jones''' originally billed ('''Lil' Little Esther''') was a child entertainer who lived in Chicago, Illinois. She was managed by her mother Gertrude Jones and her father William Jones. Esther was a trained scat singer, dancer and acrobat who used to perform regularly at nightclubs in Harlem and all over the United States in the early 1920s. In her act Baby Esther would dance, make funny faces, roll her eyes and interpolated words such as \"Boo-Boo-Boo\", \"Wha-Da-Da\", \"Doo-Doo-Doo\" & \"Do-Do-De-Do-Ho-De-Wa-Da-De-Da,\" \"Boo-Did-Do-Doo,\" \"Lo-Di-De-Do,\" and would finish off her routine with a \"De-Do\".\n\n[[Helen Kane]] first saw Esther perform in 1928, where she had a ringside seat with Tony Shayne (booking agent for both Kane and Jones) at the Everglades Club on Broadway. According to Lou Bolton, Esther debuted her \"Boops\" in April 1928. Helen Kane adapted the scat sounds she had heard to \"Poop Poop Padoop\", first using it in the Broadway musical ''Good Boy'' in which she interpolated it into the hit song \"[[I Wanna Be Loved by You|I Wanna Be Loved By You]]\" becoming famous overnight. Helen also used a variety of scat sounds in her 1928 Victor song releases; \"[[That's My Weakness Now]]\" and \"[[Get Out and Get Under the Moon]]\". Kane didn't release the hit Broadway song \"I Wanna Be Loved By You\" on record until September 20, 1928. An early test sound film was discovered which featured Baby Esther performing in this style, disproving Kane's claims of inventing the scat lyrics \"Boop-Boop-a-Doop\". Baby Esther's ex-manager Bolton testified that Helen Kane had seen Baby Esther's cabaret act in 1928 with Tony Shayne, and then not too long after suddenly started to scat sing in shows. Supreme Court Judge Edward J. McGoldrick ruled: \"The plaintiff has failed to sustain either cause of action by proof of sufficient probative force.\"{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nEsther had been cited as the \"original\" scat singer who inspired Helen Kane to scat sing. Esther was honored along with Josephine Hall in 1930, for representing African-Americans and the United States of America when she toured Europe.\n\n== Career ==\nBaby Esther's career began in the early 1920s when she won first prize in a Charleston contest in Chicago. Esther lived in the obscure \"colored\" part of Chicago with her mother and father. She was then only 4. Russian-American theatrical manager Lou Bolton saw her performance and got her engagements in Chicago, New York, Detroit, Toronto and other cities, after which he brought her to Europe. Esther Jones was rarely called Baby Esther while performing and went by the names \"Li'l Esther\" and \"Little Esther\". Originally she was billed \"Farina's Kid Sister\", but was later known as the \"Miniature Florence Mills\". Esther started her career impersonating [[Florence Mills]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nLou Bolton, who was Esther Jones' ex-manager, used Farina's fame to promote Esther in her earlier career. In 1926, Farina, better known as [[Allen Hoskins]], was an expert Charleston dancer, along with his sister Baby Jane. When Esther Jones debuted as Lil' Esther, she was impersonating and or copying Lil' Farina, and was even using his name. Farina was also known as \"Little Farina\" and that is where the name \"Little Esther\" originates. Before Esther left for Europe she was connected to Loew's vaudeville theatre. While touring Spain, Esther was referenced as a \"La Pandilla\" which translates to \"Little Rascal.\" In reality, this had more to do with her impersonation of Farina.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} Sources indicate that Esther might have appeared in a MGM ''[[Our Gang]]'' film short.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== 1928 ===\nIn 1928, Esther performed briefly at an obscure nightclub called the Everglades Club, where she would do imitations of Florence Mills, late at night. One time Esther's 60-year-old father William Jones and manager Lou Bolton got fined for having Esther perform on stage. Esther's booking agent was Tony Shayne at the time, who one night brought Helen Sugar Kane (another person who he managed) to meet Lou Bolton. There both Kane and Shayne had ringside seats and watched Esther sing and dance on stage. Not too long after watching Esther's performance, Helen Kane suddenly started to scat sing in her act.\n\nIn 1928, Esther was signed for a talking short by Movietone booked through William Morris for M.G.M, flanked by a 26-piece orchestra from the Capitol theater, New York city.\n\nHarrison G. Smith, a business associate of Bolden Smith of New York, furnished Esther with several songs: \"The Turtle Walk,\" \"My Little Dixie Home,\" \"I've Got the Blues for Dixieland\" and \"I need a Man (Around My House)\".\n\n=== 1929 ===\nEsther toured Europe in 1929 and became the highest-paid child artist in the world. While touring Europe she delighted audiences including royalty. In Spain she played for King Alphonso and [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg|Queen Victoria Eugenie]]. In Sweden [[Gustaf V of Sweden|King Gustave]] and the Queen came to the theater especially to see her. In France, Germany, and other countries, Esther also gave private performances for the nobility and high society. Esther also returned to America a few times.\n\nEsther Jones' first appearance was at the Moulin Rouge. In Paris, Esther was known as the \"Miniature Josephine Baker\". Audiences raved over her and the Parisian newspapers gave much space to her. ''Vu'', leading illustrated weekly, devoted the entire front cover to her picture and a full page in the interior. Esther would sing, dance, do the splits and generally carry on to the great delight of her audiences and was dubbed as being \"too cute for words\".{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe ''London Sunday People'' in its review of Paris plays said of Baby Esther: \"Thousands flock no longer to the Moulin Rouge to see [[Mistinguett]] herself or the clever American ballet girls, or the beautiful women of the chorus, but to applaud a little mite, 10-year-old, who has won fame and wealth within the space of a few weeks. We are living in an age of speed but this amazing little child has broken every record of sudden theatrical success.\"{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nEsther continued her success in South America. In Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Montevideo she proved to be a sensation. In Rio de Janeiro, American Ambassador Morgan came to see her play and after her performance came backstage to congratulate her. He said that is was simply marvelous that she could sing in so many different languages and invited her to sing for him at the American embassy. Accompanying Esther was [[Gordon Stretton]], who was known as the Prince of Wales' favorite jazz entertainer. In the course of the evening the president of Brazil expressed to Sidney Garner his great pleasure at seeing such capable black American artists in Brazil.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nEsther was interviewed in Rio de Janeiro by press who wanted to know how she had avoided the racists who lynched and burned black people in Texas and Alabama. Esther replied that she had so far escaped their wrath by staying out of the South.\n\n=== 1930\u20131934 ===\nWhen Esther returned to the United States she continued touring and danced for [[Cab Calloway]] and his Orchestra as one of his Sepia Dancers at his club in New York. From 1933 to 1934, Esther appeared in Helena Justa's ''Harlem Maniacs'' revue. One of the main reasons Baby Esther is not remembered is because she was never a feature attraction in Cab Calloway's New York club; she was a background Sepia dancer, which is why Esther was only given a small tap dancing number in Justa's revue. Justa had loaned the Sepia dancers from Cab Calloway. In 1934, Esther would have been 13 years old, as she was 7 in 1928. Although with Esther, there seemed to have been a bit of age fabrication, to make her seem either younger or older than she actually was. In a few articles from 1929, it states that Esther was around 11\u201312 years of age.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nEsther later returned to the stage as \"The Sepia Dancing Doll\" and was dubbed the fastest colored dancer who was red hot. Misinformation spread by pseudologists lay claim that Esther died, when in reality she was still active up until September 1934.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn 1934, Esther also attended a NAACP for Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson. Robinson also taught Helena Justa and Florence Mills. According to a source, Esther later became a full-time acrobat and had later lost most of her appeal and was then succeeded by other black child stars such as Baby Hilda and Baby Selma.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==''Kane v. Fleischer''==\nIn 1930, [[Fleischer Studios]] animator [[Grim Natwick]] introduced a caricature of Helen Kane, in the form of an anthropomorphic singing dog with droopy ears and a squeaky singing voice, in the [[Talkartoons]] cartoon ''[[Dizzy Dishes]]''. \"Betty Boop\", as the character was later dubbed, soon became popular and the star of her own cartoons. In 1932, Betty Boop was changed into a human, the long dog ears becoming hoop earrings.\n\nIn May 1932, [[Helen Kane]] filed a $250,000 lawsuit against [[Max Fleischer]] and [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Publix Corporation]], for \"exploiting her image\", charging unfair competition and wrongful appropriation in the Betty Boop cartoons, contending that Betty Boop's \"boop-oop-a-doop\" style constituted a \"deliberate caricature\" that gave her \"unfair competition\".\n[[Image:Betty-boop-opening-title.jpg|thumb|right|200px|1930 title card of one of the earliest [[Betty Boop]] cartoons]]\nThe trial opened that year in the [[New York State Supreme Court]], with Kane and Betty Boop films being viewed only by the judge. No jury was called. Vocal performers [[Margie Hines]], [[Little Ann Little]], Kate Wright, [[Bonnie Poe]], and most notably [[Mae Questel]] were all summoned to testify.\n\nLittle Ann Little told the court how the \"boop-oop-a-doop\" phrase had started out as \"ba-da inde-do\", which developed into \"bo do-de-o-do\" and finally to \"boop-oop-a-doop\". Helen Kane's counsel asked Little, who spoke throughout the trial in a Betty Boop voice, \"Oh, do you speak like that way at home?\" Little responded to the court, \"Yes, indeedy!\"\n\n=== Defense uses Baby Esther===\nThe defense argued that Kane had taken the idea from Baby Esther. Evidence was produced that Kane actually derived that singing style from watching Baby Esther perform at the Cotton Club several years before the creation of the Betty Boop character. Theatrical manager Lou Bolton testified for the defense stating that in 1925, he coached a \"young negro child\" named Esther, teaching her how to interpolate her songs with scat lyrics, \"boo-boo-boo\" and \"doo-doo-doo\", which Kane later reinvented as her trademark \"boop oop a doop\". Jones' manager testified that he and Kane had seen her act together in April 1928, and just a few weeks later, Kane began to \"boop\".<ref>{{cite news |title=The \"Boop\" Song Is Traced: Witness in Helen Kane's Suit Says Negro Girl Originated Style |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 2, 1934 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1934/05/02/archives/the-boop-song-is-traced-witness-in-helen-kanes-suit-says-negro-girl.html}}</ref>\n\n[[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] was able to prove that Kane did not uniquely originate or have claim to the Betty Boop style of singing or look.

She performed regularly at the [[Cotton Club (New York City)|Cotton Club]] in [[Harlem]]. Theatrical manager Lou Boulton testified during the ''Kane v. Fleischer'' trial that [[Helen Kane]] saw Baby Esther's [[cabaret]] act in 1928 with him and appropriated Jones' style of singing, changing the interpolated words \"boo-boo-boo\" and \"doo-doo-doo\" to \"boop-boop-a-doop\" in a recording of \"[[I Wanna Be Loved By You]]\". Kane never publicly admitted this. Jones' style, as imitated by Kane, went on to become the inspiration for the voice of the cartoon character [[Betty Boop]].\n\nWhen Kane attempted to sue [[Fleischer Studios]] for using her persona, the studios defended themselves by arguing that Kane herself had taken it from \"Baby Esther\" Jones. An early test sound film of Baby Esther's performance was used as evidence.

She was managed by her mother Gertrude Jones and her father William Jones. Esther was a trained scat singer, dancer and acrobat who used to perform regularly at nightclubs in Harlem and all over the United States in the early 1920s. In her act Baby Esther would dance, make funny faces, roll her eyes and interpolated words such as \"Boo-Boo-Boo\", \"Wha-Da-Da\", \"Doo-Doo-Doo\" & \"Do-Do-De-Do-Ho-De-Wa-Da-De-Da,\" \"Boo-Did-Do-Doo,\" \"Lo-Di-De-Do,\" and would finish off her routine with a \"De-Do\".\n\n[[Helen Kane]] first saw Esther perform in 1928, where she had a ringside seat with Tony Shayne (booking agent for both Kane and Jones) at the Everglades Club on Broadway. According to Lou Bolton, Esther debuted her \"Boops\" in April 1928. Helen Kane adapted the scat sounds she had heard to \"Poop Poop Padoop\", first using it in the Broadway musical ''Good Boy'' in which she interpolated it into the hit song \"[[I Wanna Be Loved by You|I Wanna Be Loved By You]]\" becoming famous overnight. Helen also used a variety of scat sounds in her 1928 Victor song releases; \"[[That's My Weakness Now]]\" and \"[[Get Out and Get Under the Moon]]\". Kane didn't release the hit Broadway song \"I Wanna Be Loved By You\" on record until September 20, 1928. An early test sound film was discovered which featured Baby Esther performing in this style, disproving Kane's claims of inventing the scat lyrics \"Boop-Boop-a-Doop\". Baby Esther's ex-manager Bolton testified that Helen Kane had seen Baby Esther's cabaret act in 1928 with Tony Shayne, and then not too long after suddenly started to scat sing in shows. Supreme Court Judge Edward J. McGoldrick ruled: \"The plaintiff has failed to sustain either cause of action by proof of sufficient probative force.\"{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nEsther had been cited as the \"original\" scat singer who inspired Helen Kane to scat sing. Esther was honored along with Josephine Hall in 1930, for representing African-Americans and the United States of America when she toured Europe.\n\n== Career ==\nBaby Esther's career began in the early 1920s when she won first prize in a Charleston contest in Chicago. Esther lived in the obscure \"colored\" part of Chicago with her mother and father. She was then only 4. Russian-American theatrical manager Lou Bolton saw her performance and got her engagements in Chicago, New York, Detroit, Toronto and other cities, after which he brought her to Europe. Esther Jones was rarely called Baby Esther while performing and went by the names \"Li'l Esther\" and \"Little Esther\". Originally she was billed \"Farina's Kid Sister\", but was later known as the \"Miniature Florence Mills\". Esther started her career impersonating [[Florence Mills]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nLou Bolton, who was Esther Jones' ex-manager, used Farina's fame to promote Esther in her earlier career. In 1926, Farina, better known as [[Allen Hoskins]], was an expert Charleston dancer, along with his sister Baby Jane. When Esther Jones debuted as Lil' Esther, she was impersonating and or copying Lil' Farina, and was even using his name. Farina was also known as \"Little Farina\" and that is where the name \"Little Esther\" originates. Before Esther left for Europe she was connected to Loew's vaudeville theatre. While touring Spain, Esther was referenced as a \"La Pandilla\" which translates to \"Little Rascal.\" In reality, this had more to do with her impersonation of Farina.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} Sources indicate that Esther might have appeared in a MGM ''[[Our Gang]]'' film short.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== 1928 ===\nIn 1928, Esther performed briefly at an obscure nightclub called the Everglades Club, where she would do imitations of Florence Mills, late at night. One time Esther's 60-year-old father William Jones and manager Lou Bolton got fined for having Esther perform on stage. Esther's booking agent was Tony Shayne at the time, who one night brought Helen Sugar Kane (another person who he managed) to meet Lou Bolton. There both Kane and Shayne had ringside seats and watched Esther sing and dance on stage. Not too long after watching Esther's performance, Helen Kane suddenly started to scat sing in her act.\n\nIn 1928, Esther was signed for a talking short by Movietone booked through William Morris for M.G.M, flanked by a 26-piece orchestra from the Capitol theater, New York city.\n\nHarrison G. Smith, a business associate of Bolden Smith of New York, furnished Esther with several songs: \"The Turtle Walk,\" \"My Little Dixie Home,\" \"I've Got the Blues for Dixieland\" and \"I need a Man (Around My House)\".\n\n=== 1929 ===\nEsther toured Europe in 1929 and became the highest-paid child artist in the world. While touring Europe she delighted audiences including royalty. In Spain she played for King Alphonso and [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg|Queen Victoria Eugenie]]. In Sweden [[Gustaf V of Sweden|King Gustave]] and the Queen came to the theater especially to see her. In France, Germany, and other countries, Esther also gave private performances for the nobility and high society. Esther also returned to America a few times.\n\nEsther Jones' first appearance was at the Moulin Rouge. In Paris, Esther was known as the \"Miniature Josephine Baker\". Audiences raved over her and the Parisian newspapers gave much space to her. ''Vu'', leading illustrated weekly, devoted the entire front cover to her picture and a full page in the interior. Esther would sing, dance, do the splits and generally carry on to the great delight of her audiences and was dubbed as being \"too cute for words\".{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe ''London Sunday People'' in its review of Paris plays said of Baby Esther: \"Thousands flock no longer to the Moulin Rouge to see [[Mistinguett]] herself or the clever American ballet girls, or the beautiful women of the chorus, but to applaud a little mite, 10-year-old, who has won fame and wealth within the space of a few weeks.
