Respiratory droplet transmission is the usual route for respiratory infections. Transmission can occur when respiratory droplets reach susceptible mucosal surfaces, such as in the eyes, nose or mouth. This can also happen indirectly via contact with [[Fomite|contaminated surfaces]] when hands then touch the face.

Respiratory droplet transmission is the usual route for respiratory infections. Transmission can occur when respiratory droplets reach susceptible mucosal surfaces, such as in the eyes, nose or mouth. This can also happen indirectly via contact with [[Fomite|contaminated surfaces]] when hands then touch the face. Respiratory droplets are large and cannot remain suspended in the air for long, and are usually dispersed over short distances.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/file/9771/download?token=kglD2z9R|title=Clinical Educators Guide for the prevention and control of infection in healthcare|last=|first=|date=2010|website=|publisher=Australian [[National Health and Medical Research Council]]|page=3|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405034015/http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/cd33_icg_clinical_ed_guide_web.pdf|archivedate=2015-04-05|accessdate=2015-09-12}}</ref>\n\nViruses spread by droplet transmission include [[influenza virus]], [[rhinovirus]], [[respiratory syncytial virus]], [[enterovirus]], and [[norovirus]];<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=La Rosa|first=Giuseppina|last2=Fratini|first2=Marta|last3=Della Libera|first3=Simonetta|last4=Iaconelli|first4=Marcello|last5=Muscillo|first5=Michele|date=2013-06-01|title=Viral infections acquired indoors through airborne, droplet or contact transmission|url=https://www.scielosp.org/article/aiss/2013.v49n2/124-132/|journal=Annali dell'Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0|volume=49|issue=02|pages=124\u2013132|doi=10.4415/ANN_13_02_03|issn=0021-2571|via=}}</ref> [[measles morbillivirus]];<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://eportal.mountsinai.ca/Microbiology/faq/transmission.shtml|title=FAQ: Methods of Disease Transmission|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Mount Sinai Hospital (Toronto)]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> and [[coronaviruses]] such as [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS coronavirus]]<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> and [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2|the virus]] that causes [[COVID-19]].<ref name=\"WHO\">{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/23-03-2020-pass-the-message-five-steps-to-kicking-out-coronavirus|title=Pass the message: Five steps to kicking out coronavirus|last=|first=|date=2020-02-23|website=World Health Organization|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=2020-03-24}}</ref>  Bacterial and fungal infection agents may also be transmitted by respiratory droplets.<ref name=\":1\" />  By contrast, a limited number of diseases can be spread through [[airborne disease|airborne transmission]] after the respiratory droplet dries out.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nAmbient temperature and humidity affects the survivability of bioaerosols, because as the droplet evaporates and becomes smaller, it provides less protection for the infectious agents it may contain.

Set in the small town of Banshee in Pennsylvania [[Amish]] country, the series' main character is an enigmatic ex-con ([[Antony Starr]]), who assumes the identity of Lucas Hood, the town's murdered sheriff, to hide from powerful crime lord Rabbit ([[Ben Cross]]). Imposing his own brand of justice, Hood attempts to reconcile with his former lover, Rabbit's daughter, Anastasia ([[Ivana Mili\u010devi\u0107]]), who has herself adopted an assumed identity, married, and raised a family during Hood's incarceration. Hood struggles to maintain his new identity while still embracing crime alongside his partners Job ([[Hoon Lee]]) and Sugar ([[Frankie Faison]]), and coming into conflict with local kingpin Kai Proctor ([[Ulrich Thomsen]]).\n\nThe series was developed as part of Cinemax's drive to develop original content. A 10-episode second season debuted in January 2014. ''Banshee'' was renewed for a third season that same month, which debuted in January 2015. In February 2015, the series was renewed for an 8-episode fourth and final season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2015/02/12/banshee-renewed-for-season-4?abthid=54dcf0e1843c33e828000015|title=Banshee Renewed for Season 4|last=Fowler|first=Matt|work=[[IGN]]|date=February 12, 2015|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cinemax-cancels-banshee-811754|title=Cinemax Cancels 'Banshee'|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=July 28, 2015|accessdate=July 29, 2015}}</ref> The final episode aired on May 20, 2016.\n\n== Premise ==\nA man is released from prison after serving 15 years for stealing $15 million in diamonds on behalf of his employer, a Ukrainian mob boss named Rabbit. He and his former lover and accomplice, Rabbit's daughter Anastasia (Ana), had already decided to keep the loot for themselves.  Anastasia got away with the diamonds and Rabbit is after the man, thinking he will lead him to his daughter and the diamonds. The man flees to the small fictional Pennsylvanian town of Banshee, where Ana has been living under the alias of Carrie Hopewell, mother of two and wife of the DA. Lucas Hood, the new sheriff, arrives in a bar at the entrance to the town and is immediately killed when he intervenes in a dispute between local criminals and the bar owner. The man takes Hood's identity and has to impersonate the sheriff and deal with ex-Amish crime lord Kai Proctor, sort things out with \"Carrie\" and get his share of the diamonds while evading Rabbit.<ref name=\"Plot1\"/><ref name=\"Plot2\"/>\n\nSeason 1 focuses on Hood's attempts to restore his relationship with Carrie under the looming threat of Rabbit finding them. Hood completely disregards the law while clashing with Proctor and pursuing his often criminal activities, alienating his own deputies. Rabbit eventually tracks him down and Hood surrenders to spare Carrie. Carrie leads some criminal accomplices and the deputies in a raid to free Hood and shoots Rabbit.\n\nSeason 2 deals with tribal chief Alex Longshadow's attempt to build a casino on the reservation which places Sheriff Hood in the middle of a violent struggle between Longshadow and Proctor. Carrie must face up to her past when she is imprisoned for her part in the raid against her father. With Carrie trying to fix her marriage, Hood enters into a relationship with his deputy Siobhan.<ref name=\"Series1General2\"/> He must deal with the real Hood's son when he comes to Banshee looking for his father.<ref name=\"Season2Jason\"/> Hood and Carrie are forced to track down and confront Rabbit and settle things once and for all when they learn he survived being shot.<ref name=\"S2E10Review\"/>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Banshee episodes}}\n{{:List of Banshee episodes}}\n\n== Cast ==\n=== Starring ===\n* [[Antony Starr]] as the man known as Lucas Hood: An ex-con and master thief released from prison after 15 years who adopts the identity of the real Lucas Hood, Banshee's incoming sheriff, who dies in the premiere episode.

''Banshee'' premiered on January 11, 2013.<ref name=\"futon\"/> The show was first revealed in August 2011, when it was announced that [[Alan Ball (screenwriter)|Alan Ball]] would produce the crime drama. Ball helped develop the project alongside creators [[Jonathan Tropper]] and [[David Schickler]]. ''Banshee'' was originally set up at Cinemax owner [[HBO]], but moved to Cinemax when it was decided to increase original programming on that network. By August, Cinemax was finalizing casting and financial details with the intention of filming in Spring 2012 in [[North Carolina]].<ref name=\"DevelopmentOrigin\"/><ref name=\"DevelopmentOrigin2\"/> In January 2012, Cinemax ordered ten episodes for the show's first season, with the first episode being directed by [[Greg Yaitanes]].<ref name=\"DevelopmentOrigin2\"/> In March 2012, Servitto, Dunn and Owens were cast as, respectively, Brock Lotus, Siobhan Kelly, and Mayor Dan Kendall.<ref name=\"DevelopmentCasting\"/> Later that month, Starr was cast as lead character Lucas Hood, alongside Grosse as deputy Emmett Yawners, Thomsen as Kai Proctor, Lee as Job, and Milicevic as Carrie Hopewell.<ref name=\"DevelopmentCasting3\"/><ref name=\"DevelopmentCasting4\"/><ref name=\"DevelopmentCasting7\"/> Simmons was cast in April as Proctor's niece, Rebecca Bowman, an Amish girl who lives a rebellious double life,<ref name=\"DevelopmentCasting5\"/> and in August 2012, Odette Annable was cast in the recurring role of Nola Longshadow, a Native American assassin.<ref name=\"DevelopmentCasting6\"/> Tropper, Schickler, Ball, Yaitanes and [[Peter Macdissi]] serve as executive producers.<ref name=\"SeasonOneProducers\"/>\n\nDuring the first day of shooting on the series, Starr suffered a facial injury when stunt fight choreography went wrong, splitting his lip open. He continued to film for six hours to complete the scene before going to the hospital to receive six stitches. The injury required digital removal for all scenes set before the fight but filmed after the stunt, resulting in lengthy post-production on the first episode. Some of the many fight scenes on the show can take up to 25 hours to film.<ref name=\"Series1General\"/> Yaitanes cited [[Jason Statham]]-starring action films, and [[John Carpenter]] films ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]'' (1986) and ''[[They Live]]'' (1988) as inspiration for the fights and violence in ''Banshee''. Marcus Young serves as the series' fight choreographer.<ref name=\"StuntsMisc1\"/>\n\nOn January 29, 2013 Cinemax renewed ''Banshee'' for a 10-episode second season which premiered on January 10, 2014.<ref name=\"Season2B\"/><ref name=\"season2\"/> The season's opening action set piece featuring Milicevic, Starr, and Lee, performing a high-speed heist, was filmed across five miles of closed highway. Tropper originally wrote the scene for the show's accompanying graphic novel, ''Banshee Origins'' which follows the trio sixteen years earlier, but he decided that it would be an interesting live action stunt.<ref name=\"Season2Ep1Stunt\"/> The season finale's shoot out was filmed inside a church in Harlem, New York. The scene was shot over three days.<ref name=\"Season3StarrInt\"/>\n\nAfter three episodes of the second season had aired, ''Banshee'' was renewed for third season,<ref name=\"Season3Renew\"/> which premiered on January 9, 2015.<ref name=\"Season3Premiere\"/>\n\nFor the first three seasons, filming took place mainly in the [[Mooresville, North Carolina]] area. In addition to Mooresville, other area locations were used including Huntersville, Mount Ulla, Lincolnton, Salisbury, Charlotte, Monroe, Gastonia and Waxhaw. Because [[North Carolina General Assembly|North Carolina's legislature]] chose not to continue tax credits for filming movies and TV series, the show moved to the [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] area, centering in the suburb of [[Vandergrift, Pennsylvania]]. Pennsylvania has continued to offer tax incentives.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://triblive.com/neighborhoods/yourallekiskivalley/yourallekiskivalleymore/8301549-74/street-vandergrift-banshee#axzz3ZmTtYSea |title='Banshee' to begin filming in Vandergrift}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nThe first season of ''Banshee'' received a 64% score on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], an average rating of 6.05/10, sampled from 33 reviews.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/banshee/s01/ |title=Banshee: Season 1 (2013) |work=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref> Seasons 2, 3, and 4 received scores of 93%, 100%, and 100% respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/banshee/|title=Banshee|website= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]] it has a weighted average score of 61/100 based on reviews from 29 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Banshee |url= http://www.metacritic.com/tv/banshee/ |website= [[Metacritic]] |publisher=CBS Interactive}}</ref>\n\n''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' critic Dorothy Rabinowitz wrote, \"Its smartness comes shining through despite the claptrap (none worse than the parade of sex scenes, soft-porn variety, whose noisiness is exceeded only by their unconvincingness); its story, littered with intriguingly repellent characters, like Kai Proctor (Ulrich Thomsen), local evil tycoon, grows ever more enticing\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Wall street Journal Review|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324081704578233710443186102|newspaper=Wall street journal}}</ref> The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' said about Banshee, \"It has a solid pedigree.

Set in the small town of Banshee in Pennsylvania [[Amish]] country, the series' main character is an enigmatic ex-con ([[Antony Starr]]), who assumes the identity of Lucas Hood, the town's murdered sheriff, to hide from powerful crime lord Rabbit ([[Ben Cross]]). Imposing his own brand of justice, Hood attempts to reconcile with his former lover, Rabbit's daughter, Anastasia ([[Ivana Mili\u010devi\u0107]]), who has herself adopted an assumed identity, married, and raised a family during Hood's incarceration. Hood struggles to maintain his new identity while still embracing crime alongside his partners Job ([[Hoon Lee]]) and Sugar ([[Frankie Faison]]), and coming into conflict with local kingpin Kai Proctor ([[Ulrich Thomsen]]).\n\nThe series was developed as part of Cinemax's drive to develop original content. A 10-episode second season debuted in January 2014. ''Banshee'' was renewed for a third season that same month, which debuted in January 2015. In February 2015, the series was renewed for an 8-episode fourth and final season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2015/02/12/banshee-renewed-for-season-4?abthid=54dcf0e1843c33e828000015|title=Banshee Renewed for Season 4|last=Fowler|first=Matt|work=[[IGN]]|date=February 12, 2015|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cinemax-cancels-banshee-811754|title=Cinemax Cancels 'Banshee'|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=July 28, 2015|accessdate=July 29, 2015}}</ref> The final episode aired on May 20, 2016.\n\n== Premise ==\nA man is released from prison after serving 15 years for stealing $15 million in diamonds on behalf of his employer, a Ukrainian mob boss named Rabbit. He and his former lover and accomplice, Rabbit's daughter Anastasia (Ana), had already decided to keep the loot for themselves.  Anastasia got away with the diamonds and Rabbit is after the man, thinking he will lead him to his daughter and the diamonds. The man flees to the small fictional Pennsylvanian town of Banshee, where Ana has been living under the alias of Carrie Hopewell, mother of two and wife of the DA. Lucas Hood, the new sheriff, arrives in a bar at the entrance to the town and is immediately killed when he intervenes in a dispute between local criminals and the bar owner. The man takes Hood's identity and has to impersonate the sheriff and deal with ex-Amish crime lord Kai Proctor, sort things out with \"Carrie\" and get his share of the diamonds while evading Rabbit.<ref name=\"Plot1\"/><ref name=\"Plot2\"/>\n\nSeason 1 focuses on Hood's attempts to restore his relationship with Carrie under the looming threat of Rabbit finding them. Hood completely disregards the law while clashing with Proctor and pursuing his often criminal activities, alienating his own deputies. Rabbit eventually tracks him down and Hood surrenders to spare Carrie. Carrie leads some criminal accomplices and the deputies in a raid to free Hood and shoots Rabbit.\n\nSeason 2 deals with tribal chief Alex Longshadow's attempt to build a casino on the reservation which places Sheriff Hood in the middle of a violent struggle between Longshadow and Proctor. Carrie must face up to her past when she is imprisoned for her part in the raid against her father. With Carrie trying to fix her marriage, Hood enters into a relationship with his deputy Siobhan.<ref name=\"Series1General2\"/> He must deal with the real Hood's son when he comes to Banshee looking for his father.<ref name=\"Season2Jason\"/> Hood and Carrie are forced to track down and confront Rabbit and settle things once and for all when they learn he survived being shot.<ref name=\"S2E10Review\"/>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Banshee episodes}}\n{{:List of Banshee episodes}}\n\n== Cast ==\n=== Starring ===\n* [[Antony Starr]] as the man known as Lucas Hood: An ex-con and master thief released from prison after 15 years who adopts the identity of the real Lucas Hood, Banshee's incoming sheriff, who dies in the premiere episode.

''Banshee'' premiered on January 11, 2013.<ref name=\"futon\"/> The show was first revealed in August 2011, when it was announced that [[Alan Ball (screenwriter)|Alan Ball]] would produce the crime drama. Ball helped develop the project alongside creators [[Jonathan Tropper]] and [[David Schickler]]. ''Banshee'' was originally set up at Cinemax owner [[HBO]], but moved to Cinemax when it was decided to increase original programming on that network. By August, Cinemax was finalizing casting and financial details with the intention of filming in Spring 2012 in [[North Carolina]].<ref name=\"DevelopmentOrigin\"/><ref name=\"DevelopmentOrigin2\"/> In January 2012, Cinemax ordered ten episodes for the show's first season, with the first episode being directed by [[Greg Yaitanes]].<ref name=\"DevelopmentOrigin2\"/> In March 2012, Servitto, Dunn and Owens were cast as, respectively, Brock Lotus, Siobhan Kelly, and Mayor Dan Kendall.<ref name=\"DevelopmentCasting\"/> Later that month, Starr was cast as lead character Lucas Hood, alongside Grosse as deputy Emmett Yawners, Thomsen as Kai Proctor, Lee as Job, and Milicevic as Carrie Hopewell.<ref name=\"DevelopmentCasting3\"/><ref name=\"DevelopmentCasting4\"/><ref name=\"DevelopmentCasting7\"/> Simmons was cast in April as Proctor's niece, Rebecca Bowman, an Amish girl who lives a rebellious double life,<ref name=\"DevelopmentCasting5\"/> and in August 2012, Odette Annable was cast in the recurring role of Nola Longshadow, a Native American assassin.<ref name=\"DevelopmentCasting6\"/> Tropper, Schickler, Ball, Yaitanes and [[Peter Macdissi]] serve as executive producers.<ref name=\"SeasonOneProducers\"/>\n\nDuring the first day of shooting on the series, Starr suffered a facial injury when stunt fight choreography went wrong, splitting his lip open. He continued to film for six hours to complete the scene before going to the hospital to receive six stitches. The injury required digital removal for all scenes set before the fight but filmed after the stunt, resulting in lengthy post-production on the first episode. Some of the many fight scenes on the show can take up to 25 hours to film.<ref name=\"Series1General\"/> Yaitanes cited [[Jason Statham]]-starring action films, and [[John Carpenter]] films ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]'' (1986) and ''[[They Live]]'' (1988) as inspiration for the fights and violence in ''Banshee''. Marcus Young serves as the series' fight choreographer.<ref name=\"StuntsMisc1\"/>\n\nOn January 29, 2013 Cinemax renewed ''Banshee'' for a 10-episode second season which premiered on January 10, 2014.<ref name=\"Season2B\"/><ref name=\"season2\"/> The season's opening action set piece featuring Milicevic, Starr, and Lee, performing a high-speed heist, was filmed across five miles of closed highway. Tropper originally wrote the scene for the show's accompanying graphic novel, ''Banshee Origins'' which follows the trio sixteen years earlier, but he decided that it would be an interesting live action stunt.<ref name=\"Season2Ep1Stunt\"/> The season finale's shoot out was filmed inside a church in Harlem, New York. The scene was shot over three days.<ref name=\"Season3StarrInt\"/>\n\nAfter three episodes of the second season had aired, ''Banshee'' was renewed for third season,<ref name=\"Season3Renew\"/> which premiered on January 9, 2015.<ref name=\"Season3Premiere\"/>\n\nFor the first three seasons, filming took place mainly in the [[Mooresville, North Carolina]] area. In addition to Mooresville, other area locations were used including Huntersville, Mount Ulla, Lincolnton, Salisbury, Charlotte, Monroe, Gastonia and Waxhaw. Because [[North Carolina General Assembly|North Carolina's legislature]] chose not to continue tax credits for filming movies and TV series, the show moved to the [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] area, centering in the suburb of [[Vandergrift, Pennsylvania]]. Pennsylvania has continued to offer tax incentives.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://triblive.com/neighborhoods/yourallekiskivalley/yourallekiskivalleymore/8301549-74/street-vandergrift-banshee#axzz3ZmTtYSea |title='Banshee' to begin filming in Vandergrift}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nThe first season of ''Banshee'' received a 64% score on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], an average rating of 6.05/10, sampled from 33 reviews.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/banshee/s01/ |title=Banshee: Season 1 (2013) |work=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref> Seasons 2, 3, and 4 received scores of 93%, 100%, and 100% respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/banshee/|title=Banshee|website= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]] it has a weighted average score of 61/100 based on reviews from 29 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Banshee |url= http://www.metacritic.com/tv/banshee/ |website= [[Metacritic]] |publisher=CBS Interactive}}</ref>\n\n''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' critic Dorothy Rabinowitz wrote, \"Its smartness comes shining through despite the claptrap (none worse than the parade of sex scenes, soft-porn variety, whose noisiness is exceeded only by their unconvincingness); its story, littered with intriguingly repellent characters, like Kai Proctor (Ulrich Thomsen), local evil tycoon, grows ever more enticing\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Wall street Journal Review|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324081704578233710443186102|newspaper=Wall street journal}}</ref> The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' said about Banshee, \"It has a solid pedigree.

The species is [[endemic]] to [[Australia]]. Originally described by [[George Shaw]] in 1794 as a species new to science, it is one of eastern Australia's most commonly encountered snakes. Averaging around {{convert|1.25|m|abbr=on}} in length, it has glossy black upperparts, bright red or orange flanks, and a pink or dull red belly. It is not an aggressive species and generally retreats from encounters with people, but can attack if provoked.  Although its venom is capable of causing significant illness, no deaths have been recorded from its bite, which is less venomous than other Australian elapid snakes. The venom contains [[neurotoxin]]s, [[myotoxin]]s, and [[Coagulation#Procoagulants|coagulants]] and has [[Hemolysis|haemolytic]] properties; victims can also lose their sense of smell.\n\nCommon in woodlands, forests and swamplands, the red-bellied black snake often ventures into nearby urban areas. It forages in bodies of shallow water, commonly with tangles of water plants and logs, where it hunts its main prey item, frogs, as well as fish, reptiles, and small mammals. The snake is considered to be a [[least-concern species]] according to the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]], but its numbers are thought to be declining due to habitat fragmentation and decline of frog populations.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe red-bellied black snake was first described and named by English naturalist [[George Shaw]] in ''Zoology of New Holland'' (1794) as ''Coluber porphyriacus''.<ref name=shaw/>  Incorrectly assuming it was harmless,<ref name=\"williams\"/> he wrote, \"This beautiful snake, which appears to be unprovided with tubular teeth or fangs, and consequently not of a venomous nature, is three, sometimes four, feet in nature.\"<ref name=shaw>{{cite book | last=Shaw | first=George | year=1794 |title=Zoology of New Holland | location= London, United Kingdom | publisher= J.

The species is [[endemic]] to [[Australia]]. Originally described by [[George Shaw]] in 1794 as a species new to science, it is one of eastern Australia's most commonly encountered snakes. Averaging around {{convert|1.25|m|abbr=on}} in length, it has glossy black upperparts, bright red or orange flanks, and a pink or dull red belly. It is not an aggressive species and generally retreats from encounters with people, but can attack if provoked.  Although its venom is capable of causing significant illness, no deaths have been recorded from its bite, which is less venomous than other Australian elapid snakes. The venom contains [[neurotoxin]]s, [[myotoxin]]s, and [[Coagulation#Procoagulants|coagulants]] and has [[Hemolysis|haemolytic]] properties; victims can also lose their sense of smell.\n\nCommon in woodlands, forests and swamplands, the red-bellied black snake often ventures into nearby urban areas. It forages in bodies of shallow water, commonly with tangles of water plants and logs, where it hunts its main prey item, frogs, as well as fish, reptiles, and small mammals. The snake is considered to be a [[least-concern species]] according to the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]], but its numbers are thought to be declining due to habitat fragmentation and decline of frog populations.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe red-bellied black snake was first described and named by English naturalist [[George Shaw]] in ''Zoology of New Holland'' (1794) as ''Coluber porphyriacus''.<ref name=shaw/>  Incorrectly assuming it was harmless,<ref name=\"williams\"/> he wrote, \"This beautiful snake, which appears to be unprovided with tubular teeth or fangs, and consequently not of a venomous nature, is three, sometimes four, feet in nature.\"<ref name=shaw>{{cite book | last=Shaw | first=George | year=1794 |title=Zoology of New Holland | location= London, United Kingdom | publisher= J.
