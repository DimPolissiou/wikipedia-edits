The individual who holds the office is the most senior [[Minister of the Crown|minister of state]], and the leader of the [[Cabinet of Australia|federal Cabinet]]. The prime minister also has the responsibility of administering the [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]], and is the chair of the [[National Security Committee (Australia)|National Security Committee]] and the [[Council of Australian Governments]]. The office of prime minister is not mentioned in the [[Constitution of Australia]] but exists through Westminster [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|political convention]]. The individual who holds the office is commissioned by the [[Governor-General of Australia|governor-general of Australia]] and at the [[at Her Majesty's pleasure|governor-general's pleasure]] subject to the [[Constitution of Australia]] and constitutional conventions.\n\n[[Scott Morrison]] has held the office of prime minister since 24 August 2018. He received his commission after replacing [[Malcolm Turnbull]] as the leader of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]], the largest party in the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] government, following the [[2018 Liberal Party of Australia leadership spills|Liberal Party leadership spill]] earlier the same day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Scott Morrison sworn in as Australia's 30th Prime Minister |publisher=ABC News |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-15/malcolm-turbull-sworn-in-as-new-prime-minister/6777416|accessdate=23 August 2018|date=15 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Constitutional basis and appointment==\n{{Politics of Australia sidebar}}\n[[File:Australian House of Reps 1901.jpg|thumb|left|Australia's first prime minister, [[Edmund Barton]] at the central table in the [[House of Representatives (Australia)|House of Representatives]] in 1901.]]\nThe prime minister of Australia is appointed by the governor-general of Australia under Section 64 of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]], which empowers the governor-general, as the official representative of the [[Monarchy of Australia|Crown]], to appoint government ministers of state on the advice of the prime minister and requires them to be members of the House of Representatives or the Senate, or become members within three months of the appointment. The prime minister and [[Treasurer of Australia|treasurer]] are traditionally members of the House, but the Constitution does not have such a requirement.<ref name=\"senatebrief14\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Senate_Briefs/Brief14 |title=No. 14 - Ministers in the Senate |date=December 2016 |website=Senate Briefs |publisher=Parliament of Australia}}</ref> Before being sworn in as a [[Minister of the Crown|Minister of State]], a person must first be sworn in as a member of the [[Federal Executive Council (Australia)|Federal Executive Council]] if they are not already a member. Membership of the Federal Executive Council entitles the member to the style of ''The Honourable'' (usually abbreviated to ''The Hon'') for life, barring exceptional circumstances. The senior members of the Executive Council constitute the [[Cabinet of Australia]].\n\nThe prime minister is, like other ministers, normally sworn in by the governor-general and then presented with the commission ([[letters patent]]) of office. When defeated in an election, or on resigning, the prime minister is said to \"hand in the commission\" and actually does so by returning it to the governor-general. In the event of a prime minister dying in office, or becoming incapacitated, or for other reasons, the governor-general can terminate the commission. Ministers hold office \"during the pleasure of the governor-general\" (s. 64 of the Constitution of Australia), so theoretically, the governor-general can dismiss a minister at any time, by notifying them in writing of the termination of their commission; however, their power to do so except on the advice of the prime minister is heavily circumscribed by convention.\n\nAccording to convention, the prime minister is the leader of the majority party or largest party in a coalition of parties in the [[House of Representatives (Australia)|House of Representatives]] which holds the confidence of the House. Some commentators argue that the governor-general may also dismiss a prime minister who is unable to pass the government's supply bill through both houses of parliament, including the [[Australian Senate]], where the government doesn't normally command the majority, as happened in the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|1975 constitutional crisis]].<ref name=kerr>{{cite web|last1=Kerr|first1=John|title=Statement from John Kerr (dated 11 November 1975) explaining his decisions.|url=http://whitlamdismissal.com/documents/kerr-statement.shtml|website=WhitlamDismissal.com|accessdate=11 January 2017}}</ref> Other commentators argue that the governor-general acted improperly in 1975 as Whitlam still retained the confidence of the House of Representatives, and there are no generally accepted conventions to guide the use of the governor-general's reserve powers in this circumstance.<ref name=\"auto\"/> However, there is no constitutional requirement that the prime minister sit in the House of Representatives, or even be a member of the federal parliament (subject to a constitutionally prescribed limit of three months), though by convention this is always the case. The only case where a member of the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] was appointed Prime Minister was [[John Gorton]], who subsequently resigned his Senate position and was elected as a member of the House of Representatives.\n\nDespite the importance of the office of Prime Minister, the Constitution does not mention the office by name. The conventions of the [[Westminster system]] were thought to be sufficiently entrenched in Australia by the authors of the Constitution that it was deemed unnecessary to detail these.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Indeed, prior to Federation in 1901 the terms State Premier and Prime Minister were used interchangeably. <ref>{{cite news  |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/page/18494769\n|title=The Premiers' Conference - Text of the Resolutions\n|newspaper=[[The Age]]\n|accessdate=5 December 2019 \n|date=23 August 1898}}</ref>\n\nIf a government cannot get its appropriation (budget) legislation passed by the House of Representatives, or the House passes a vote of \"no confidence\" in the government, the prime minister is bound by convention to immediately advise the governor-general to dissolve the House of Representatives and hold a fresh election.\n\nFollowing a resignation in other circumstances or the death of a prime minister, the governor-general generally appoints the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Australia|deputy prime minister]] as the new prime minister, until or if such time as the governing party or senior coalition party elects an alternative party leader. This has resulted in the party leaders from the Country Party (now named National Party) being appointed as Prime Minister, despite being the smaller party of their coalition. This occurred when [[Earle Page]] became caretaker prime minister following the death of [[Joseph Lyons]] in 1939, and when [[John McEwen]] became caretaker prime minister following the [[Disappearance of Harold Holt|disappearance]] of [[Harold Holt]] in 1967. However in 1941, [[Arthur Fadden]] became the leader of the Coalition and subsequently Prime Minister by the agreement of both coalition parties, despite being the leader of the smaller party in coalition, following the resignation of UAP leader Robert Menzies.\n\nExcluding the brief transition periods during changes of government or leadership elections, there have only been a handful of cases where someone other than the leader of the majority party in the House of Representatives was Prime Minister:\n* [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] occurred on 1 January 1901, but [[1901 Australian federal election|elections for the first parliament]] were not scheduled until late March. In the interim, an unelected [[caretaker government]] was necessary. In what is now known as the [[Hopetoun Blunder]], the governor-general, [[John Hope, 7th Earl of Hopetoun|Lord Hopetoun]], invited Sir [[William Lyne]], the [[Premier of New South Wales|premier]] of the most populous state, [[New South Wales]], to form a government. Lyne was unable to do so and returned his commission in favour of [[Edmund Barton]], who became the first prime minister and led the inaugural government into and beyond the election.\n* During the second parliament, three parties (Free Trade, Protectionist and Labor) had roughly equal representation in the House of Representatives. The leaders of the three parties, [[Alfred Deakin]], [[George Reid]] and [[Chris Watson]] each served as Prime Minister before losing a vote of confidence.\n* As a result of the [[Australian Labor Party split of 1916|Labor Party's split over conscription]], [[Billy Hughes]] and his supporters were expelled from the Labor Party in November 1916. He subsequently continued on as prime minister at the head of the new [[National Labor Party]], which had only 14 members out of a total of 75 in the House of Representatives. The [[Commonwealth Liberal Party]] \u2013 despite still forming the official Opposition \u2013 provided confidence and supply until February 1917, when the two parties agree to merge and form the [[Nationalist Party (Australia)|Nationalist Party]].\n* During the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|1975 constitutional crisis]], on 11 November 1975, the governor-general, Sir [[John Kerr (governor-general)|John Kerr]], dismissed the Labor Party's [[Gough Whitlam]] as Prime Minister. Despite Labor holding a majority in the House of Representatives, Kerr appointed the Leader of the Opposition, [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] leader [[Malcolm Fraser]] as caretaker prime minister, conditional on the passage of the Whitlam government's [[Confidence and supply|Supply]] bills through the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] and the calling of an election for both houses of parliament. Fraser accepted these terms and immediately advised a [[double dissolution]]. An election was called for [[1975 Australian federal election|13&nbsp;December]], which the Liberal Party won in its own right (although the Liberals governed in a coalition with the Country Party).\n\n==Powers and role==\n[[Image:ac.bartonministry.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The first prime minister of Australia, Edmund Barton (sitting second from left), with his Cabinet, 1901.]]\n\nMost of the prime minister's power derives from being the [[head of government]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} In practice, the [[Federal Executive Council (Australia)|Federal Executive Council]] acts to ratify all executive decisions made by the government and requires the support of the prime minister. The powers of the prime minister are to direct the governor-general through advice to grant [[royal assent|Royal Assent]] to legislation, to dissolve and prorogue parliament, to call elections and to make government appointments, which the governor-general follows.\n\nThe Constitution divides power between the federal government and the states, and the prime minister is constrained by this.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://australianpolitics.com/executive/pm/prime-minister-roles-powers-restraints|title=Prime Minister: Roles, Powers and Restraints|publisher=Australian Politics}}</ref>\n\nThe formal power to appoint the [[Governor-General of Australia|governor-general]] lies with the [[Monarchy of Australia|queen of Australia]], on the advice of the prime minister, whereby convention holds that the queen is bound to follow the advice. The prime minister can also advise the monarch to dismiss the governor-general, though it remains unclear how quickly the monarch would act on such advice in a constitutional crisis. This uncertainty, and the possibility of a \"race\" between the governor-general and prime minister to dismiss the other, was a key question in the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|1975 constitutional crisis]]. Prime ministers whose government loses a [[motion of no confidence|vote of no-confidence]] in the House of Representatives, are expected to advise the governor-general to dissolve parliament and hold an election, if an alternative government cannot be formed. If they fail to do this, the governor-general may by convention dissolve parliament or appoint an alternative government.<ref name=kerr>{{cite web|last1=Kerr|first1=John|title=Statement from John Kerr (dated 11 November 1975) explaining his decisions.|url=http://whitlamdismissal.com/documents/kerr-statement.shtml|website=WhitlamDismissal.com|accessdate=11 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe prime minister is also the responsible minister for the [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]], which is tasked with supporting the policy agendas of the prime minister and [[Cabinet of Australia|Cabinet]] through policy advice and the coordination of the implementation of key government programs, to manage [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander]] policy and programs and to promote [[conflict resolution|reconciliation]], to provide leadership for the [[Australian Public Service]] alongside the [[Australian Public Service Commission]], to oversee the [[Australian honours system|honours]] and [[Australian royal symbols|symbols]] of the Commonwealth, to provide support to ceremonies and official visits, to set whole of government service delivery policy, and to coordinate national security, cyber, counterterrorism, regulatory reform, cities, population, data, and women's policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dpmc.gov.au/resource-centre/government/administrative-arrangements-order-1-september-2016|title=Administrative Arrangements Order|date=1 September 2016|publisher=[[Commonwealth of Australia]]|accessdate=11 January 2017|work=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet|format=PDF}}</ref> Since 1992, the prime minister also acts as the chair of the [[Council of Australian Governments]] (COAG), an intergovernmental forum between the federal government and the state governments in which the prime minister, the state premiers and chief ministers, and  a representative of local governments meet annually.<ref>https://www.coag.gov.au/about-coag</ref>\n\n==Privileges of office==\n\n===Salary===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"float:right; margin:1ex 0 1ex 1ex;\"\n|+ '''Prime ministerial salary history'''\n|-\n!

The primary official residence is [[The Lodge (Australia)|The Lodge]] in [[Canberra]]. Most prime ministers have chosen The Lodge as their primary residence because of its security facilities and close proximity to Parliament House. There have been some exceptions, however. [[James Scullin]] preferred to live at the [[Hotel Canberra]] (now the Hyatt Hotel) and [[Ben Chifley]] lived in the [[Hotel Kurrajong]]. More recently, [[John Howard]] used the [[Sydney]] Prime Ministerial residence, [[Kirribilli House]], as his primary accommodation. On her appointment on 24 June 2010, [[Julia Gillard]] said she would not be living in The Lodge until such time as she was returned to office by popular vote at the [[2010 Australian federal election|next general election]], as she became Prime Minister by replacing an incumbent during a parliamentary term. [[Tony Abbott]] was never able to occupy The Lodge during his term (2013\u201315) as it was undergoing extensive renovations, which continued into the early part of his successor [[Malcolm Turnbull]]'s term.<ref>[https://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/act/report-blames-abbott-government-for-renovation-nightmare-at-the-lodge-20170818-gxzbd9.html Canberra Times, 18 August 2017].

At [[Kirribilli House]] in Sydney, there is one full-time chef and one full-time house attendant.<ref>{{cite news|last=Metherell|first=Mark|title=Rudds' staff extends to a child carer at the Lodge|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/rudds-staff-extends-to-a-child-carer-at-the-lodge/2008/02/18/1203190740533.html|accessdate=24 June 2010|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=19 February 2008}}</ref>\nThe official residences are fully staffed and catered for both the prime minister and their family. In addition, both have extensive security facilities. These residences are regularly used for official entertaining, such as receptions for [[Australian of the Year]] finalists.\n\nThe prime minister receives a number of transport amenities for official business. The [[Royal Australian Air Force]]'s [[No. 34 Squadron RAAF|No. 34 Squadron]] transports the prime minister within Australia and overseas by specially converted Boeing Business Jets and smaller Challenger aircraft. The aircraft contain secure communications equipment as well as an office, conference room and sleeping compartments. The call-sign for the aircraft is \"Envoy\". For ground travel, the prime minister is transported in an armoured [[BMW]] 7 Series model. It is referred to as \"C-1\", or Commonwealth One, because of its licence plate. It is escorted by police vehicles from state and federal authorities.<ref>{{cite web|author=CarAdvice.com.au |url=http://www.caradvice.com.au/27616/over-25-of-government-car-fleet-foreign-made/ |title=25% of government car fleet foreign made |publisher=Car Advice |date=6 April 2009|accessdate=12 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" style=\"text-align: center;\" heights=\"150\" perrow=\"3\" caption=\"Privileges of office\">\nFile:The Lodge Canberra.jpg|'''[[The Lodge (Australia)|The Lodge]]'''\nFile:(1)Kirribilli House Kirribilli.jpg|'''[[Kirribilli House]]'''\nFile:BMW 7er M-Sportpaket (F01) \u2013 Frontansicht, 7.

of the [[Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]]. The individual who holds the office is the most senior [[Minister of the Crown|minister of state]], and the leader of the [[Cabinet of Australia|federal Cabinet]]. The prime minister also has the responsibility of administering the [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]], and is the chair of the [[National Security Committee (Australia)|National Security Committee]] and the [[Council of Australian Governments]]. The office of prime minister is not mentioned in the [[Constitution of Australia]] but exists through Westminster [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|political convention]]. The individual who holds the office is commissioned by the [[Governor-General of Australia|governor-general of Australia]] and at the [[at Her Majesty's pleasure|governor-general's pleasure]] subject to the [[Constitution of Australia]] and constitutional conventions.\n\n[[Scott Morrison]] has held the office of prime minister since 24 August 2018. He received his commission after replacing [[Malcolm Turnbull]] as the leader of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]], the largest party in the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] government, following the [[2018 Liberal Party of Australia leadership spills|Liberal Party leadership spill]] earlier the same day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Scott Morrison sworn in as Australia's 30th Prime Minister |publisher=ABC News |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-15/malcolm-turbull-sworn-in-as-new-prime-minister/6777416|accessdate=23 August 2018|date=15 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Constitutional basis and appointment==\n{{Politics of Australia sidebar}}\n[[File:Australian House of Reps 1901.jpg|thumb|left|Australia's first prime minister, [[Edmund Barton]] at the central table in the [[House of Representatives (Australia)|House of Representatives]] in 1901.]]\nThe prime minister of Australia is appointed by the governor-general of Australia under Section 64 of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]], which empowers the governor-general, as the official representative of the [[Monarchy of Australia|Crown]], to appoint government ministers of state on the advice of the prime minister and requires them to be members of the House of Representatives or the Senate, or become members within three months of the appointment. The prime minister and [[Treasurer of Australia|treasurer]] are traditionally members of the House, but the Constitution does not have such a requirement.<ref name=\"senatebrief14\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Senate_Briefs/Brief14 |title=No. 14 - Ministers in the Senate |date=December 2016 |website=Senate Briefs |publisher=Parliament of Australia}}</ref> Before being sworn in as a [[Minister of the Crown|Minister of State]], a person must first be sworn in as a member of the [[Federal Executive Council (Australia)|Federal Executive Council]] if they are not already a member. Membership of the Federal Executive Council entitles the member to the style of ''The Honourable'' (usually abbreviated to ''The Hon'') for life, barring exceptional circumstances. The senior members of the Executive Council constitute the [[Cabinet of Australia]].\n\nThe prime minister is, like other ministers, normally sworn in by the governor-general and then presented with the commission ([[letters patent]]) of office. When defeated in an election, or on resigning, the prime minister is said to \"hand in the commission\" and actually does so by returning it to the governor-general. In the event of a prime minister dying in office, or becoming incapacitated, or for other reasons, the governor-general can terminate the commission. Ministers hold office \"during the pleasure of the governor-general\" (s. 64 of the Constitution of Australia), so theoretically, the governor-general can dismiss a minister at any time, by notifying them in writing of the termination of their commission; however, their power to do so except on the advice of the prime minister is heavily circumscribed by convention.\n\nAccording to convention, the prime minister is the leader of the majority party or largest party in a coalition of parties in the [[House of Representatives (Australia)|House of Representatives]] which holds the confidence of the House. Some commentators argue that the governor-general may also dismiss a prime minister who is unable to pass the government's supply bill through both houses of parliament, including the [[Australian Senate]], where the government doesn't normally command the majority, as happened in the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|1975 constitutional crisis]].<ref name=kerr>{{cite web|last1=Kerr|first1=John|title=Statement from John Kerr (dated 11 November 1975) explaining his decisions.|url=http://whitlamdismissal.com/documents/kerr-statement.shtml|website=WhitlamDismissal.com|accessdate=11 January 2017}}</ref> Other commentators argue that the governor-general acted improperly in 1975 as Whitlam still retained the confidence of the House of Representatives, and there are no generally accepted conventions to guide the use of the governor-general's reserve powers in this circumstance.<ref name=\"auto\"/> However, there is no constitutional requirement that the prime minister sit in the House of Representatives, or even be a member of the federal parliament (subject to a constitutionally prescribed limit of three months), though by convention this is always the case. The only case where a member of the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] was appointed Prime Minister was [[John Gorton]], who subsequently resigned his Senate position and was elected as a member of the House of Representatives.\n\nDespite the importance of the office of Prime Minister, the Constitution does not mention the office by name. The conventions of the [[Westminster system]] were thought to be sufficiently entrenched in Australia by the authors of the Constitution that it was deemed unnecessary to detail these.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Indeed, prior to Federation in 1901 the terms State Premier and Prime Minister were used interchangeably. <ref>{{cite news  |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/page/18494769\n|title=The Premiers' Conference - Text of the Resolutions\n|newspaper=[[The Age]]\n|accessdate=5 December 2019 \n|date=23 August 1898}}</ref>\n\nIf a government cannot get its appropriation (budget) legislation passed by the House of Representatives, or the House passes a vote of \"no confidence\" in the government, the prime minister is bound by convention to immediately advise the governor-general to dissolve the House of Representatives and hold a fresh election.\n\nFollowing a resignation in other circumstances or the death of a prime minister, the governor-general generally appoints the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Australia|deputy prime minister]] as the new prime minister, until or if such time as the governing party or senior coalition party elects an alternative party leader. This has resulted in the party leaders from the Country Party (now named National Party) being appointed as Prime Minister, despite being the smaller party of their coalition. This occurred when [[Earle Page]] became caretaker prime minister following the death of [[Joseph Lyons]] in 1939, and when [[John McEwen]] became caretaker prime minister following the [[Disappearance of Harold Holt|disappearance]] of [[Harold Holt]] in 1967. However in 1941, [[Arthur Fadden]] became the leader of the Coalition and subsequently Prime Minister by the agreement of both coalition parties, despite being the leader of the smaller party in coalition, following the resignation of UAP leader Robert Menzies.\n\nExcluding the brief transition periods during changes of government or leadership elections, there have only been a handful of cases where someone other than the leader of the majority party in the House of Representatives was Prime Minister:\n* [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] occurred on 1 January 1901, but [[1901 Australian federal election|elections for the first parliament]] were not scheduled until late March. In the interim, an unelected [[caretaker government]] was necessary. In what is now known as the [[Hopetoun Blunder]], the governor-general, [[John Hope, 7th Earl of Hopetoun|Lord Hopetoun]], invited Sir [[William Lyne]], the [[Premier of New South Wales|premier]] of the most populous state, [[New South Wales]], to form a government. Lyne was unable to do so and returned his commission in favour of [[Edmund Barton]], who became the first prime minister and led the inaugural government into and beyond the election.\n* During the second parliament, three parties (Free Trade, Protectionist and Labor) had roughly equal representation in the House of Representatives. The leaders of the three parties, [[Alfred Deakin]], [[George Reid]] and [[Chris Watson]] each served as Prime Minister before losing a vote of confidence.\n* As a result of the [[Australian Labor Party split of 1916|Labor Party's split over conscription]], [[Billy Hughes]] and his supporters were expelled from the Labor Party in November 1916. He subsequently continued on as prime minister at the head of the new [[National Labor Party]], which had only 14 members out of a total of 75 in the House of Representatives. The [[Commonwealth Liberal Party]] \u2013 despite still forming the official Opposition \u2013 provided confidence and supply until February 1917, when the two parties agree to merge and form the [[Nationalist Party (Australia)|Nationalist Party]].\n* During the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|1975 constitutional crisis]], on 11 November 1975, the governor-general, Sir [[John Kerr (governor-general)|John Kerr]], dismissed the Labor Party's [[Gough Whitlam]] as Prime Minister. Despite Labor holding a majority in the House of Representatives, Kerr appointed the Leader of the Opposition, [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] leader [[Malcolm Fraser]] as caretaker prime minister, conditional on the passage of the Whitlam government's [[Confidence and supply|Supply]] bills through the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] and the calling of an election for both houses of parliament. Fraser accepted these terms and immediately advised a [[double dissolution]]. An election was called for [[1975 Australian federal election|13&nbsp;December]], which the Liberal Party won in its own right (although the Liberals governed in a coalition with the Country Party).\n\n==Powers and role==\n[[Image:ac.bartonministry.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The first prime minister of Australia, Edmund Barton (sitting second from left), with his Cabinet, 1901.]]\n\nMost of the prime minister's power derives from being the [[head of government]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} In practice, the [[Federal Executive Council (Australia)|Federal Executive Council]] acts to ratify all executive decisions made by the government and requires the support of the prime minister. The powers of the prime minister are to direct the governor-general through advice to grant [[royal assent|Royal Assent]] to legislation, to dissolve and prorogue parliament, to call elections and to make government appointments, which the governor-general follows.\n\nThe Constitution divides power between the federal government and the states, and the prime minister is constrained by this.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://australianpolitics.com/executive/pm/prime-minister-roles-powers-restraints|title=Prime Minister: Roles, Powers and Restraints|publisher=Australian Politics}}</ref>\n\nThe formal power to appoint the [[Governor-General of Australia|governor-general]] lies with the [[Monarchy of Australia|queen of Australia]], on the advice of the prime minister, whereby convention holds that the queen is bound to follow the advice. The prime minister can also advise the monarch to dismiss the governor-general, though it remains unclear how quickly the monarch would act on such advice in a constitutional crisis. This uncertainty, and the possibility of a \"race\" between the governor-general and prime minister to dismiss the other, was a key question in the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|1975 constitutional crisis]]. Prime ministers whose government loses a [[motion of no confidence|vote of no-confidence]] in the House of Representatives, are expected to advise the governor-general to dissolve parliament and hold an election, if an alternative government cannot be formed. If they fail to do this, the governor-general may by convention dissolve parliament or appoint an alternative government.<ref name=kerr>{{cite web|last1=Kerr|first1=John|title=Statement from John Kerr (dated 11 November 1975) explaining his decisions.|url=http://whitlamdismissal.com/documents/kerr-statement.shtml|website=WhitlamDismissal.com|accessdate=11 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe prime minister is also the responsible minister for the [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]], which is tasked with supporting the policy agendas of the prime minister and [[Cabinet of Australia|Cabinet]] through policy advice and the coordination of the implementation of key government programs, to manage [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander]] policy and programs and to promote [[conflict resolution|reconciliation]], to provide leadership for the [[Australian Public Service]] alongside the [[Australian Public Service Commission]], to oversee the [[Australian honours system|honours]] and [[Australian royal symbols|symbols]] of the Commonwealth, to provide support to ceremonies and official visits, to set whole of government service delivery policy, and to coordinate national security, cyber, counterterrorism, regulatory reform, cities, population, data, and women's policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dpmc.gov.au/resource-centre/government/administrative-arrangements-order-1-september-2016|title=Administrative Arrangements Order|date=1 September 2016|publisher=[[Commonwealth of Australia]]|accessdate=11 January 2017|work=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet|format=PDF}}</ref> Since 1992, the prime minister also acts as the chair of the [[Council of Australian Governments]] (COAG), an intergovernmental forum between the federal government and the state governments in which the prime minister, the state premiers and chief ministers, and  a representative of local governments meet annually.<ref>https://www.coag.gov.au/about-coag</ref>\n\n==Privileges of office==\n\n===Salary===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"float:right; margin:1ex 0 1ex 1ex;\"\n|+ '''Prime ministerial salary history'''\n|-\n!

The primary official residence is [[The Lodge (Australia)|The Lodge]] in [[Canberra]]. Most prime ministers have chosen The Lodge as their primary residence because of its security facilities and close proximity to Parliament House. There have been some exceptions, however. [[James Scullin]] preferred to live at the [[Hotel Canberra]] (now the Hyatt Hotel) and [[Ben Chifley]] lived in the [[Hotel Kurrajong]]. More recently, [[John Howard]] used the [[Sydney]] Prime Ministerial residence, [[Kirribilli House]], as his primary accommodation. On her appointment on 24 June 2010, [[Julia Gillard]] said she would not be living in The Lodge until such time as she was returned to office by popular vote at the [[2010 Australian federal election|next general election]], as she became Prime Minister by replacing an incumbent during a parliamentary term. [[Tony Abbott]] was never able to occupy The Lodge during his term (2013\u201315) as it was undergoing extensive renovations, which continued into the early part of his successor [[Malcolm Turnbull]]'s term.<ref>[https://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/act/report-blames-abbott-government-for-renovation-nightmare-at-the-lodge-20170818-gxzbd9.html Canberra Times, 18 August 2017].

At [[Kirribilli House]] in Sydney, there is one full-time chef and one full-time house attendant.<ref>{{cite news|last=Metherell|first=Mark|title=Rudds' staff extends to a child carer at the Lodge|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/rudds-staff-extends-to-a-child-carer-at-the-lodge/2008/02/18/1203190740533.html|accessdate=24 June 2010|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=19 February 2008}}</ref>\nThe official residences are fully staffed and catered for both the prime minister and their family. In addition, both have extensive security facilities. These residences are regularly used for official entertaining, such as receptions for [[Australian of the Year]] finalists.\n\nThe prime minister receives a number of transport amenities for official business. The [[Royal Australian Air Force]]'s [[No. 34 Squadron RAAF|No. 34 Squadron]] transports the prime minister within Australia and overseas by specially converted Boeing Business Jets and smaller Challenger aircraft. The aircraft contain secure communications equipment as well as an office, conference room and sleeping compartments. The call-sign for the aircraft is \"Envoy\". For ground travel, the prime minister is transported in an armoured [[BMW]] 7 Series model. It is referred to as \"C-1\", or Commonwealth One, because of its licence plate. It is escorted by police vehicles from state and federal authorities.<ref>{{cite web|author=CarAdvice.com.au |url=http://www.caradvice.com.au/27616/over-25-of-government-car-fleet-foreign-made/ |title=25% of government car fleet foreign made |publisher=Car Advice |date=6 April 2009|accessdate=12 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" style=\"text-align: center;\" heights=\"150\" perrow=\"3\" caption=\"Privileges of office\">\nFile:The Lodge Canberra.jpg|'''[[The Lodge (Australia)|The Lodge]]'''\nFile:(1)Kirribilli House Kirribilli.jpg|'''[[Kirribilli House]]'''\nFile:BMW 7er M-Sportpaket (F01) \u2013 Frontansicht, 7.

[[Stanley Bruce]] was defeated in his own seat in [[1929 Australian federal election|1929]] while Prime Minister but was re-elected to parliament in [[1931 Australian federal election|1931]]. Other prime ministers were elected to parliaments other than the Australian federal parliament: [[George Reid|Sir George Reid]] was elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|UK House of Commons]] (after his term as High Commissioner to the UK), and [[Frank Forde]] was re-elected to the Queensland Parliament (after his term as High Commissioner to Canada, and a failed attempt to re-enter the Federal Parliament).\n\n==Acting prime minister==\nIt is a convention for the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Australia|deputy prime minister]] to serve as [[acting prime minister]] when the prime minister is travelling outside Australia or absent due to illness.

However, their relationship with the rest of the Gaoche and its tribal components is unclear.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 185\u2013186.</ref>\n\nIn 391 the Rouran chief, Heduohan (\u66f7\u591a\u6c57) was killed by the Tuoba [[Northern Wei]]. Heduohan's brother [[Yujiul\u00fc Shelun|Shelun]] raided several tribal dependencies of the [[Tuoba]] in retaliation, but reportedly suffered a serious defeat in 399, and was forced to flee westward.  Here Shelun defeated the Hulu (\u659b\u5f8b) tribe and subjugated them. With the aid of a Hulu named Chiluohou (\u53f1\u6d1b\u4faf), Shelun conquered most of the Gaoche tribes and proclaimed himself Kaghan of the Rouran on March 11, 402. Many Gaoche, such as Chiluohou, were promoted to establish better control.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 208\u2013211.</ref><ref>Bo Yang, \"Zizhi Tongjian\", p. 7,105 (Vol.27).</ref>\n\nDuring the reign of Shelun and his successor [[Yujiul\u00fc Datan|Datan]], the Rouran pushed as far as the [[Issyk Kul]], where they defeated the [[Wusun]] and drove them to the south. In the east they raided the Northern Wei before they were defeated on June 16, 429.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 213\u2013214, 228.</ref><ref>Bo Yang, \"Zizhi Tongjian\", p. 7,671 (Vol.30).</ref> Afterwards, as many as 1.5 million Gaoche were said to be captured and settled to areas adjacent to the capital [[Datong|Pingcheng]] in the south.\n\nAfter this settlement they were called the '''Western Chile''' (\u897f\u90e8\u6555\u52d2), including a section of the [[Ordos Desert]] south of the [[Yellow River]] known as the Hexi Chile [\u6cb3\u897f\u6555\u52d2]), the '''Eastern Chile''' (\u4e1c\u90e8\u6555\u52d2), between Wuzhou (\u6b66\u5468) and the capital suburbs), and the '''Northern Chile''' (\u5317\u90e8\u6555\u52d2), to the north and around the borders.\n\nThe greater part of the latter two possibly fled back to the steppe and were not heard of after 524 and 445 respectively. The Western Chile (mainly the Hulu and Tiele related to Fufuluo's Qifuli (\u6ce3\u4f0f\u5229) clan) rebelled between 524\uff0d526, moved further south and were eventually assimilated.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 272\u2013273, 315\u2013320.</ref>\n\nWith the loss of numerous subjects and vital resources, the Rouran went into a temporary decline. However, in 460 they launched new campaigns in the west, destroying the remnant of [[Northern Liang]]. During a campaign against [[Khotan]] in 470, the king wrote in his supplicatory letter to the Toba Emperor that all of the statelets in the west had submitted to the Rouran. In 472, [[Yujiul\u00fc Yucheng|Yucheng]] attacked Northern Wei across the western border. By the time of his death in 485, Yucheng had restored the Kaghanate to a status even more powerful than the times of Datan.\n\nDuring these wars, a southwestern Gaoche tribal group known as the '''Fufuluo''' united twelve clans and rebelled, but were defeated by the Rouran. They escaped and established a state northwest of [[Gaochang]] in 487. From then on, little is known about the rest of the Gaoche until the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks]].\n\n===Fufuluo===\nThe Fufuluo (\u526f\u4f0f\u7f57) were a Gaoche tribe of twelve clans, dwelling close to the Gaochang kingdom (likely by the Tuin River of the [[Govi-Altai Province|Govi-Altai range]]. Early on a Fufuluo clan known as the Yizhan (which had lived there since the mid 2nd century) allied with the Touba.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 186.</ref> In 481, the Fufuluo began to interfere with the [[Gaochang]] and deposed one of their kings. After the death of Yucheng, his belligerent son [[Yujiul\u00fc Doulun|Dulun]] fought more wars against the Touba.\n\nAfter a disagreement, A-Fuzhiluo betrayed him, and in 487, together with his younger cousin Qiongqi (\u7a77\u5947), they managed their clans of over 100,000 yurts to escape from the pursuing armies, led by Dulun and his uncle [[Yujiul\u00fc Nagai|Nagai]] by defeating them.\n\nAfter they settled, he founded a statelet (also known as the A-Fuzhiluo kingdom) under the title of Ulu Beglik (\u5019\u5a04\u5310\u52d2, based on an interpretation of [[Shiratori Kurakichi]] and [[Edwin G. Pulleyblank|Pulleyblank]]). Like the later Qibi and [[Xueyantuo]] in 605, the Fufuluo divided their rule between north and south at [[Dzungaria]].<ref name=\"highcart\" /> <ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 38, 217\u2013219, 366\u2013367.</ref>\n\nThe Fufuluo allied with the Northern Wei in 490 and fought against the Rouran until 541 when they were dispersed by them.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 216, 226, 229\u2013230, 252.</ref>\n\nShortly after the death of Dulun in 492, several important cities on the eastern route were taken by Fufuluo, separating the Rouran from the west. With the elimination of Rouran influence, the [[Hephthalite]]s, kindred steppe nomads, for the first time extended their domain as far as [[Karashahr]], where Qiongqi was killed and his son Mietu (\u5f25\u4fc4\u7a81) was taken hostage{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.\n\nAfter 507, the [[Hephthalites]] uninterruptedly sent eighteen embassies with gifts (\u671d\u732e/\u671d\u8d21) to the Chinese courts (twelve to [[Northern Wei]], three to [[Liang Dynasty]], two to [[Western Wei]] and one to [[Northern Zhou]]), as opposed to only one in 456.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 235\u2013239.</ref> Like [[Peroz I]] and his son [[Kavadh I]] earlier in the west, the Hephthalites helped Mietu. He returned to his realm and [[Biliyan]] (\u8dcb\u5229\u5ef6), the successor of A-Fuzhiluo, was overthrown by his tribesmen, while shortly paying tribute to the Touba. In 508, [[Yujiul\u00fc Futu|Futu]] attacked the Fufuluo and gained a victory, but was killed by Mietu on his course back. Later in 516, [[Yujiul\u00fc Chounu|Chounu]], son of Futu, defeated Mietu, and in reprisal had him towed to death by a horse. The Fufuluo went for several years into exile under the refuge of the Hephthalites. In 520, Chounu was repulsed by his younger brother Yifu (\u4f0a\u5310) who restored the realm. After his defeat, Chounu returned to the east, where he was killed in a coup in which the ruling clan of Yujiulu (\u90c1\u4e45\u95fe) was split into two factions. In 521, the Fufuluo penetrated into the Rouran territory, but were finally repulsed by 524. Thereafter, the Fufuluo suffered a series of defeats from [[Yujiul\u00fc Anagui|Anagui]] before being annihilated in 541. During the final decade, they helped the [[Eastern Wei]] to fight the [[Western Wei]] in a civil war. After defeat, the nobility surrendered to them.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 242\u2013254.</ref>\n\n=== Rulers of Gaoche ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Around 250,000 of them were then incorporated into his army. In 552, Bumin Khan sent his army and defeated Anagui just north of the Chinese border.

There was no ruler among them, and they belonged to the [[Eastern Turkic Khaganate|Eastern]] and [[Western Turkic Khaganate|Western]] [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks|T\u00fcrks]] separately. They lived in unsettled places, and moved along with the water and grass.\nThey were good at shooting on horseback, and were fierce and cruel, especially greedy. They live on plundering. The clans close to the west do several kinds of cultivating, and breed more cattle and sheep than horses.

References of the tribes in the remote areas west of the Pamir Mountains were sparse and mentioned only in passing, some tribes like the [[Alans]] were probably erroneously added. By the end of the 6th century nothing more was known about them. Those tribes in the eastern areas (north of China and near Lake Baikal), such as the [[Kurykans|Guligan]] (\u9aa8\u5229\u5e72), Duolange (\u591a\u89c8\u845b) Xijie (\u595a\u7ed3) and [[Barsils|Baixi]] (\u767d\u972b) were being rewarded afterward, though a few like the Fuluo (\u8986\u7f57), Mengchen (\u8499\u9648) and Turuhe (\u5410\u5982\u7ea5) disappeared.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 47\u201349, 330\u2013339.</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''[[New Book of Tang]]'', the [[Ashina tribe|Ashina]] clan were descended from the Tiele tribe by ancestral lineage.<ref>Rachel Lung, Interpreters in Early Imperial China, John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2011, p.48</ref><ref>Duan: ''Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele''. 1988, pp. 39-41</ref> Like the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks]], the Tiele were probably one of many nomadic [[Turkic peoples]] on the steppe.<ref>[https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E9%9A%8B%E6%9B%B8/%E5%8D%B784 Suishu]</ref><ref>Suribadalaha, \"New Studies of the Origins of the Mongols\", p. 46\u201347.</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cheng|first=Fangyi|title=The Research on the Identification Between Tiele and the Oghuric Tribes|url=https://www.academia.edu/4314856/The_Research_on_the_Identification_Between_Tiele_and_the_Oghuric_Tribes|language=en}}</ref> As some scholars noted the name \"Tiele\" and \"Tujue\" are semantically more or less alike.

Many of their tribal chiefs were expelled and some were killed during this period.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 346\u2013347.</ref> They allied themselves in a rebellion against the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks during the turmoil between 599 and 603. This might have already started as early as in 582, when rumor was spread about a revolt in the north when a raiding campaign led [[Ishbara Qaghan]] away from the capital. Among the rivals of Ishbara in the west was Tardu, son of [[Ist\u00e4mi]]. He allied with Apa Khan, a qaghan at the northern Dzungaria and Khovd River, and declared himself independent.\n\nIn 587 Baga Khan, heir of Ishbara, captured Apa with the help of the Chinese but died the next year on a campaign in the west. Later on, [[Tulan Qaghan|Dulan]] took over his reign and in 599 he, together with Tardu, launched a civil war against his son [[Qimin]], who sided with the Chinese. However, he was unsuccessful and was assassinated during his battles with the Chinese. His partner Tardu took over and launched a revolt against the Qaghanate. In 603 he was revolted against by the Tiele tribes, provoked by the Chinese, and fled to the [[Tuyuhun Kingdom|Tuyuhun]].<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 344, 349\u2013352.</ref><ref>Bo Yang, \"Zizhi Tongjian\", p. 10,680 (Vol.41) 10,795, 10,805, 10,857 (Vol.42).</ref> Earlier, when Apa was captured, Nili took over from him, but he died after the defeat of Tardu in the east. His son [[Heshana Khan]] succeeded him in the Western Qaghanate, levying heavy taxes on the Tiele. To prevent a revolt he gathered several hundreds of chiefs and murdered them. In 605 an alliance among the Tiele under the Qibi (\u5951\u82fe) and Xueyantuo (\u859b\u5ef6\u9640) tribes was formed to overthrow him. They captured most of the Dzungaria and defeated his occupying army, taking several important cities, including [[Kumul, Xinjiang|Kumul]], Karashahr and [[Gaochang]], pushing Heshana Khan further west to the lower [[Ili River]] by 607.\n\nAfter victory, the Qibi chief Geleng (\u54e5\u695e) was proclaimed as the qaghan by the tribes and the Xueyantuo chief [[Yiedie Khan]] as subordinate qaghan. At the same year Geleng allied with the Chinese to defeat the Tuyuhun to resolve a conflict at [[Dunhuang]].\n\nIn 611, Shekui, a qaghan from [[Tashkent]] and grandson of Tardu, attacked [[Ashina Xichun|Chuluo]] and forced him to escape to China. The return of Shekui marked the end of the rebellion, although exactly when the rebels were put down is uncertain. One Chinese account indicated that the Gaochang kingdom still remained under their vassal until the year 612. They were most likely subdued after this year as Shekui restored order in the Western Qaghanate.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 352\u2013356.</ref>\n\nFailure to put down these uprisings led to a fatal division within the G\u00f6kturks ruling Ashina clan. Under the leadership of [[Zhenzhu Khan]] in 628, grandson of Yishibo, the [[Xueyantuo]] made their crossing over the Altai, and quickly founded a confederation with the rest of the Tiele at the east.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 360.</ref>\n\nThe Xueyantuo founded a short-lived Qaghanate over the steppe under [[Zhenzhu Khan]], his son [[Duomi Khan]] and nephew [[Yitewushi Khan]], the last of which eventually surrendered to the Chinese.\n\n=== Chinese subjugation ===\nShortly after 646, the Uyghur and the rest of the twelve Tiele chiefs (and subsequently the far-away Guligan and Dubo) arrived at the Chinese court. They were bestowed either with the title of commander-in-chief (\u90fd\u7763 ''dudu'') or prefect (\u523a\u53f2 ''{{transl|cmn|cishi}}'') under the [[Jimi system|loose control]] (\u7f81\u7e3b ''jimi'') of the northern protectorate or \"pacificed north\" (\u5b89\u5317\u5e9c), whose seat and name changed at certain times.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 445\u2013449.</ref>\n\nThe Uyghur were prominent among the Tiele tribes next to the Xueyantuo. Their name first appeared in 390 as ''Yuanhe'' (\u8881\u7ea5). Under the leadership of Pusa (\u83e9\u8428), son of chief Tejian (\u7279\u5065), the Uyghur co-operated with the Xueyantuo to make a stand against the Eastern Qaghanate. Soon after his death, his successor Tumidu (\u5410\u8ff7\u5ea6) formed a new alliance with the Chinese and turned against his former ally. Thereafter, Tumidu was granted a Chinese title like the rest of the Tiele chiefs, and carried the title of qaghan among the other tribes, who now annually donated  furs to the Chinese to fulfill their tax obligations.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 186, 451, 453\u2013457.</ref>\n\nIn 648, Tumidu was murdered by his nephew Wuhe (\u4e4c\u7ea5) and another tribesman named Juluobo (\u4ff1\u7f57\u52c3). Both were sons-in-law of the [[Chebi Khan]], the ruler of the Eastern Qaghanate at the northern Altai, who now held hegemony over the surrounding tribes, including the Qarluq. This alerted the Chinese, and Wuhe was assassinated by a ruse upon receiving his uncle's position from the Chinese deputy in the north. Later Juluobo was detained by the Chinese. On November 17, Porun (\u5a46\u95f0) was granted his fathers title.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 457\u2013458.</ref>\n\nSince their submission, the Tiele (mainly the Uyghur) had participated in several campaigns under Chinese leadership. Under the command of Ashina Sheer (\u963f\u53f2\u90a3\u793e\u5c14), Yuan Lichen (\u5143\u793c\u81e3), Gao Kan (\u9ad8\u4f83), Liang Jianfang (\u6881\u5efa\u65b9), Cheng Zhijie (\u7a0b\u77e5\u8282), [[Su Ding Fang]] and Xiao Siya (\u8427\u55e3\u4e1a) this resulted in the capture of Chebi Khan in 650 and the end of the Western Qaghanate in 657, except for a last campaign at [[Goguryeo]] which probably killed Porun.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 459\u2013470, 493.</ref><ref>Bo Yang, \"Zizhi Tongjian\", p. 11,972 (Vol.47).</ref>\n\nDuring those campaigns, visits would be paid to restrain the tribes. In 658 such a visit was repelled, and a revolt broke out in 660 starting with the Sijie (\u601d\u7ed3), Bayegu (\u62d4\u91ce\u53e4), Pugu (\u4ec6\u9aa8) and Tongluo (\u540c\u7f57). The reason for this revolt is unclear, perhaps due to the Chinese repression of the surrounding tribes during the campaigns.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 472\u2013475.</ref> Two years later the revolts were suppressed by the Chinese at the upper [[Selenge River]] around [[Khangai Mountains|Khangai]]. The battle was short, and a massacre was said to be committed by the two leading commanders. According to one exaggerated account from [[Tang Huiyao]] around 900,000 surrendered tribesmen were slaughtered, though it is certain that a large number of them were captured.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 477\u2013478.</ref> After the event, a message was sent to the north to appease the restless Tiele.\n\nIn 669 similar unsuccessful revolts had been made by the Xueyantuo, but the details of these are vague.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 479\u2013481.</ref> The last revolt was mentioned in 686, led by the Pugu and Tongluo to join with the Ashina clan, who had formed the [[Second Turkic Khaganate]] under [[Ilterish Qaghan]] in 682. They were immediately suppressed by an army dispatched from [[Juyan]]. A number of them were moved to that region along with the seat of the protectorate under the jurisdiction of [[Zhangye|Ganzhou]]. Earlier during the rebellion contacts between the northern protectorate and the Chinese capital were cut off, and the only way to pass was through the area of [[Jiuquan|Suzhou]].<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 482\u2013488.</ref>\n\n=== Rise of the Uyghur Khaganate ===\n{{Main article|Uyghur Khaganate}}\nAfter the disintegration of the Eastern Qaghanate in 630, many G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk nobles were resettled either at the Chinese border or in the capital. Some went on to participate in frontier campaigns for the Chinese.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 413.</ref><ref>Bo Yang, \"Zizhi Tongjian\", p. 11,660 (Vol.46).</ref>\n\nIn 679 a major rebellion was led by three G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk nobles{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. Among them, Ashina Nishufu (\u963f\u53f2\u90a3\u6ce5\u719f\u5310), a direct descendant of Illig, was chosen as their qaghan. They were quickly subdued by the Chinese and their leader was betrayed and killed by his own troops. The rest of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks managed to escape and allied themselves with Ashina Funian (\u963f\u53f2\u90a3\u4f0f\u5ff5) for a new rebellion. Funian declared himself qaghan in 681, but his revolt did not succeed and more than fifty participants were executed on November 16 at the Chinese capital.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 481, 483.</ref><ref>Bo Yang, \"Zizhi Tongjian\", p. 12,265, 12,273, 12,284, 12,292 (Vol.48).</ref> The remaining rebellious G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks formed the Second Turkic Eastern Qaghanate under Ilteris Sad and his 5,000 supporters. They were mostly active in the southern region bordering China at mount \u010co\u03b3ay (\u603b\u6750\u5c71). Over the decade they held countless raids across the Chinese border.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 483, 495.</ref>\n\nExactly when or how the Tiele came under their subjection is unclear. However, during this period, a number of pro-Chinese Tiele groups who had earlier cooperated with the Chinese against them, such as Uyghur, Qibi, Sijie and Hun (\u6d51), escaped into the [[Hexi Corridor]] and eventually resettled to [[Wuwei, Gansu|Liangzhou]].\n\nAccording to the Tonyukuk and K\u00fcltigin [[Orkhon script]], the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks made five out of forty-seven attacks on the Tiele who were led by Ilteris. Among them, four seem to have been mere raids while the last attack could be seen as their re-subjection on the northern steppe. The estimated date for the Tiele submission to the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks would be around 687, probably without much resistance.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 484, 501\u2013505, 523.</ref>\n\nThe establishment of a second G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk capital at the foot of the sacred mountain \u00d6t\u00fcken (\u90fd\u65a4\u5c71) brought unrest to the Tiele tribes. After the Uyghur chief was killed, they were recruited for their annual raiding campaigns over the Chinese border after 694.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 434, 505\u2013509.</ref> These raids were halted in 708, as the Chinese constructed fortifications along the Ordos. Raids continued elsewhere as [[Qapagan Khan|Qapagan]] turned his attention to the west and the [[Turgesh]] and [[Karl\u00edk|Qarluq]] tribes between 708 and 715. By this time, some of the Tiele had escaped into China and were settled in [[Yinchuan|Lingzhou]] and elsewhere, while others like the Bayegu had revolted in 707. These revolts continued until 716 and Qapagan, on his way back from suppressing revolts by the Uyghur, Tongluo, Baixi, Bayegu and Pugu, was ambushed and killed by a Bayegu tribesman named Xiezhilue (\u9889\u8d28\u7565) on July 22. In conclusion, not all tribes were involved in the revolts. Two of the northernmost tribal allies, the Guligan and Dubo (\u90fd\u64ad) did not participate in any of the revolts.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 509\u2013511, 515.</ref><ref>Bo Yang, \"Zizhi Tongjian\", p. 12,852 (Vol.50).</ref>\n\nSoon, [[Bilge Khan]] took over the reign and together with [[Tonyukuk]], began to appease the subjected Tiele. Tonyukuk was born in China and was considered a wise statesman in both Turkic and Chinese accounts. Meanwhile, a friendly relationship was built with the Chinese. Till the end of the Second Eastern Qaghanate only one raid in 720 was made on the Chinese border. Bilge Khan started to call for a return of the former members of the Tiele tribes who had settled in China. He had risen in status among the tribal chiefs, especially the Uyghur within the Qaghanate.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 517\u2013520.</ref>\n\nDuring this period, many Tiele had betrayed the local Chinese authorities and fled to the north, in particular the five communities around Liang, Ling, [[Yulin, Shaanxi|Xia]], [[Baynnur|Feng]], and [[Shuozhou|Bingzhou]], while minor insurgencies had occurred throughout the process.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 532\u2013539.</ref> Among the returning Tiele tribes was the Uyghur, specifically the Yaoluoge, who had escaped into China until 727.

Within a few years, an alliance was established between the [[Basmyl]] (\u62d4\u6089\u871c), Uyghur and Qarluq. They overthrew the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks and killed the qaghan. Most of the heirs were killed subsequently. At the same time the Basmyl chief, who was approved as qaghan, was overthrown by the allies.\n\nIn 745 the exiled qaghan of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks was killed by an Uyghur chief named Qutlugh Boyla, son of Hushu (\u62a4\u8f93).

However, their relationship with the rest of the Gaoche and its tribal components is unclear.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 185\u2013186.</ref>\n\nIn 391 the Rouran chief, Heduohan (\u66f7\u591a\u6c57) was killed by the Tuoba [[Northern Wei]]. Heduohan's brother [[Yujiul\u00fc Shelun|Shelun]] raided several tribal dependencies of the [[Tuoba]] in retaliation, but reportedly suffered a serious defeat in 399, and was forced to flee westward.  Here Shelun defeated the Hulu (\u659b\u5f8b) tribe and subjugated them. With the aid of a Hulu named Chiluohou (\u53f1\u6d1b\u4faf), Shelun conquered most of the Gaoche tribes and proclaimed himself Kaghan of the Rouran on March 11, 402. Many Gaoche, such as Chiluohou, were promoted to establish better control.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 208\u2013211.</ref><ref>Bo Yang, \"Zizhi Tongjian\", p. 7,105 (Vol.27).</ref>\n\nDuring the reign of Shelun and his successor [[Yujiul\u00fc Datan|Datan]], the Rouran pushed as far as the [[Issyk Kul]], where they defeated the [[Wusun]] and drove them to the south.

The Western Chile (mainly the Hulu and Tiele related to Fufuluo's Qifuli (\u6ce3\u4f0f\u5229) clan) rebelled between 524\uff0d526, moved further south and were eventually assimilated.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 272\u2013273, 315\u2013320.</ref>\n\nWith the loss of numerous subjects and vital resources, the Rouran went into a temporary decline. However, in 460 they launched new campaigns in the west, destroying the remnant of [[Northern Liang]]. During a campaign against [[Khotan]] in 470, the king wrote in his supplicatory letter to the Toba Emperor that all of the statelets in the west had submitted to the Rouran. In 472, [[Yujiul\u00fc Yucheng|Yucheng]] attacked Northern Wei across the western border. By the time of his death in 485, Yucheng had restored the Kaghanate to a status even more powerful than the times of Datan.\n\nDuring these wars, a southwestern Gaoche tribal group known as the '''Fufuluo''' united twelve clans and rebelled, but were defeated by the Rouran. They escaped and established a state northwest of [[Gaochang]] in 487. From then on, little is known about the rest of the Gaoche until the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks]].\n\n===Fufuluo===\nThe Fufuluo (\u526f\u4f0f\u7f57) were a Gaoche tribe of twelve clans, dwelling close to the Gaochang kingdom (likely by the Tuin River of the [[Govi-Altai Province|Govi-Altai range]]. Early on a Fufuluo clan known as the Yizhan (which had lived there since the mid 2nd century) allied with the Touba.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 186.</ref> In 481, the Fufuluo began to interfere with the [[Gaochang]] and deposed one of their kings. After the death of Yucheng, his belligerent son [[Yujiul\u00fc Doulun|Dulun]] fought more wars against the Touba.\n\nAfter a disagreement, A-Fuzhiluo betrayed him, and in 487, together with his younger cousin Qiongqi (\u7a77\u5947), they managed their clans of over 100,000 yurts to escape from the pursuing armies, led by Dulun and his uncle [[Yujiul\u00fc Nagai|Nagai]] by defeating them.\n\nAfter they settled, he founded a statelet (also known as the A-Fuzhiluo kingdom) under the title of Ulu Beglik (\u5019\u5a04\u5310\u52d2, based on an interpretation of [[Shiratori Kurakichi]] and [[Edwin G. Pulleyblank|Pulleyblank]]). Like the later Qibi and [[Xueyantuo]] in 605, the Fufuluo divided their rule between north and south at [[Dzungaria]].<ref name=\"highcart\" /> <ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 38, 217\u2013219, 366\u2013367.</ref>\n\nThe Fufuluo allied with the Northern Wei in 490 and fought against the Rouran until 541 when they were dispersed by them.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 216, 226, 229\u2013230, 252.</ref>\n\nShortly after the death of Dulun in 492, several important cities on the eastern route were taken by Fufuluo, separating the Rouran from the west. With the elimination of Rouran influence, the [[Hephthalite]]s, kindred steppe nomads, for the first time extended their domain as far as [[Karashahr]], where Qiongqi was killed and his son Mietu (\u5f25\u4fc4\u7a81) was taken hostage{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.\n\nAfter 507, the [[Hephthalites]] uninterruptedly sent eighteen embassies with gifts (\u671d\u732e/\u671d\u8d21) to the Chinese courts (twelve to [[Northern Wei]], three to [[Liang Dynasty]], two to [[Western Wei]] and one to [[Northern Zhou]]), as opposed to only one in 456.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 235\u2013239.</ref> Like [[Peroz I]] and his son [[Kavadh I]] earlier in the west, the Hephthalites helped Mietu. He returned to his realm and [[Biliyan]] (\u8dcb\u5229\u5ef6), the successor of A-Fuzhiluo, was overthrown by his tribesmen, while shortly paying tribute to the Touba. In 508, [[Yujiul\u00fc Futu|Futu]] attacked the Fufuluo and gained a victory, but was killed by Mietu on his course back. Later in 516, [[Yujiul\u00fc Chounu|Chounu]], son of Futu, defeated Mietu, and in reprisal had him towed to death by a horse. The Fufuluo went for several years into exile under the refuge of the Hephthalites. In 520, Chounu was repulsed by his younger brother Yifu (\u4f0a\u5310) who restored the realm. After his defeat, Chounu returned to the east, where he was killed in a coup in which the ruling clan of Yujiulu (\u90c1\u4e45\u95fe) was split into two factions. In 521, the Fufuluo penetrated into the Rouran territory, but were finally repulsed by 524. Thereafter, the Fufuluo suffered a series of defeats from [[Yujiul\u00fc Anagui|Anagui]] before being annihilated in 541. During the final decade, they helped the [[Eastern Wei]] to fight the [[Western Wei]] in a civil war. After defeat, the nobility surrendered to them.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 242\u2013254.</ref>\n\n=== Rulers of Gaoche ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

There was no ruler among them, and they belonged to the [[Eastern Turkic Khaganate|Eastern]] and [[Western Turkic Khaganate|Western]] [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks|T\u00fcrks]] separately. They lived in unsettled places, and moved along with the water and grass.\nThey were good at shooting on horseback, and were fierce and cruel, especially greedy. They live on plundering. The clans close to the west do several kinds of cultivating, and breed more cattle and sheep than horses.

References of the tribes in the remote areas west of the Pamir Mountains were sparse and mentioned only in passing, some tribes like the [[Alans]] were probably erroneously added. By the end of the 6th century nothing more was known about them. Those tribes in the eastern areas (north of China and near Lake Baikal), such as the [[Kurykans|Guligan]] (\u9aa8\u5229\u5e72), Duolange (\u591a\u89c8\u845b) Xijie (\u595a\u7ed3) and [[Barsils|Baixi]] (\u767d\u972b) were being rewarded afterward, though a few like the Fuluo (\u8986\u7f57), Mengchen (\u8499\u9648) and Turuhe (\u5410\u5982\u7ea5) disappeared.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 47\u201349, 330\u2013339.</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''[[New Book of Tang]]'', the [[Ashina tribe|Ashina]] clan were descended from the Tiele tribe by ancestral lineage.<ref>Rachel Lung, Interpreters in Early Imperial China, John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2011, p.48</ref><ref>Duan: ''Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele''. 1988, pp. 39-41</ref> Like the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks]], the Tiele were probably one of many nomadic [[Turkic peoples]] on the steppe.<ref>[https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E9%9A%8B%E6%9B%B8/%E5%8D%B784 Suishu]</ref><ref>Suribadalaha, \"New Studies of the Origins of the Mongols\", p. 46\u201347.</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cheng|first=Fangyi|title=The Research on the Identification Between Tiele and the Oghuric Tribes|url=https://www.academia.edu/4314856/The_Research_on_the_Identification_Between_Tiele_and_the_Oghuric_Tribes|language=en}}</ref> As some scholars noted the name \"Tiele\" and \"Tujue\" are semantically more or less alike.

Many of their tribal chiefs were expelled and some were killed during this period.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 346\u2013347.</ref> They allied themselves in a rebellion against the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks during the turmoil between 599 and 603. This might have already started as early as in 582, when rumor was spread about a revolt in the north when a raiding campaign led [[Ishbara Qaghan]] away from the capital. Among the rivals of Ishbara in the west was Tardu, son of [[Ist\u00e4mi]]. He allied with Apa Khan, a qaghan at the northern Dzungaria and Khovd River, and declared himself independent.\n\nIn 587 Baga Khan, heir of Ishbara, captured Apa with the help of the Chinese but died the next year on a campaign in the west. Later on, [[Tulan Qaghan|Dulan]] took over his reign and in 599 he, together with Tardu, launched a civil war against his son [[Qimin]], who sided with the Chinese. However, he was unsuccessful and was assassinated during his battles with the Chinese. His partner Tardu took over and launched a revolt against the Qaghanate. In 603 he was revolted against by the Tiele tribes, provoked by the Chinese, and fled to the [[Tuyuhun Kingdom|Tuyuhun]].<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 344, 349\u2013352.</ref><ref>Bo Yang, \"Zizhi Tongjian\", p. 10,680 (Vol.41) 10,795, 10,805, 10,857 (Vol.42).</ref> Earlier, when Apa was captured, Nili took over from him, but he died after the defeat of Tardu in the east. His son [[Heshana Khan]] succeeded him in the Western Qaghanate, levying heavy taxes on the Tiele. To prevent a revolt he gathered several hundreds of chiefs and murdered them. In 605 an alliance among the Tiele under the Qibi (\u5951\u82fe) and Xueyantuo (\u859b\u5ef6\u9640) tribes was formed to overthrow him. They captured most of the Dzungaria and defeated his occupying army, taking several important cities, including [[Kumul, Xinjiang|Kumul]], Karashahr and [[Gaochang]], pushing Heshana Khan further west to the lower [[Ili River]] by 607.\n\nAfter victory, the Qibi chief Geleng (\u54e5\u695e) was proclaimed as the qaghan by the tribes and the Xueyantuo chief [[Yiedie Khan]] as subordinate qaghan. At the same year Geleng allied with the Chinese to defeat the Tuyuhun to resolve a conflict at [[Dunhuang]].\n\nIn 611, Shekui, a qaghan from [[Tashkent]] and grandson of Tardu, attacked [[Ashina Xichun|Chuluo]] and forced him to escape to China. The return of Shekui marked the end of the rebellion, although exactly when the rebels were put down is uncertain. One Chinese account indicated that the Gaochang kingdom still remained under their vassal until the year 612. They were most likely subdued after this year as Shekui restored order in the Western Qaghanate.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 352\u2013356.</ref>\n\nFailure to put down these uprisings led to a fatal division within the G\u00f6kturks ruling Ashina clan. Under the leadership of [[Zhenzhu Khan]] in 628, grandson of Yishibo, the [[Xueyantuo]] made their crossing over the Altai, and quickly founded a confederation with the rest of the Tiele at the east.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 360.</ref>\n\nThe Xueyantuo founded a short-lived Qaghanate over the steppe under [[Zhenzhu Khan]], his son [[Duomi Khan]] and nephew [[Yitewushi Khan]], the last of which eventually surrendered to the Chinese.\n\n=== Chinese subjugation ===\nShortly after 646, the Uyghur and the rest of the twelve Tiele chiefs (and subsequently the far-away Guligan and Dubo) arrived at the Chinese court. They were bestowed either with the title of commander-in-chief (\u90fd\u7763 ''dudu'') or prefect (\u523a\u53f2 ''{{transl|cmn|cishi}}'') under the [[Jimi system|loose control]] (\u7f81\u7e3b ''jimi'') of the northern protectorate or \"pacificed north\" (\u5b89\u5317\u5e9c), whose seat and name changed at certain times.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 445\u2013449.</ref>\n\nThe Uyghur were prominent among the Tiele tribes next to the Xueyantuo. Their name first appeared in 390 as ''Yuanhe'' (\u8881\u7ea5). Under the leadership of Pusa (\u83e9\u8428), son of chief Tejian (\u7279\u5065), the Uyghur co-cooperated with the Xueyantuo to make a stand against the Eastern Qaghanate. Soon after his death, his successor Tumidu (\u5410\u8ff7\u5ea6) formed a new alliance with the Chinese and turned against his former ally. Thereafter, Tumidu was granted a Chinese title like the rest of the Tiele chiefs, and carried the title of qaghan among the other tribes, who now annually donated  furs to the Chinese to fulfill their tax obligations.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 186, 451, 453\u2013457.</ref>\n\nIn 648, Tumidu was murdered by his nephew Wuhe (\u4e4c\u7ea5) and another tribesman named Juluobo (\u4ff1\u7f57\u52c3). Both were sons-in-law of the [[Chebi Khan]], the ruler of the Eastern Qaghanate at the northern Altai, who now held hegemony over the surrounding tribes, including the Qarluq. This alerted the Chinese, and Wuhe was assassinated by a ruse upon receiving his uncle's position from the Chinese deputy in the north. Later Juluobo was detained by the Chinese. On November 17, Porun (\u5a46\u95f0) was granted his fathers title.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 457\u2013458.</ref>\n\nSince their submission, the Tiele (mainly the Uyghur) had participated in several campaigns under Chinese leadership. Under the command of Ashina Sheer (\u963f\u53f2\u90a3\u793e\u5c14), Yuan Lichen (\u5143\u793c\u81e3), Gao Kan (\u9ad8\u4f83), Liang Jianfang (\u6881\u5efa\u65b9), Cheng Zhijie (\u7a0b\u77e5\u8282), [[Su Ding Fang]] and Xiao Siya (\u8427\u55e3\u4e1a) this resulted in the capture of Chebi Khan in 650 and the end of the Western Qaghanate in 657, except for a last campaign at [[Goguryeo]] which probably killed Porun.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 459\u2013470, 493.</ref><ref>Bo Yang, \"Zizhi Tongjian\", p. 11,972 (Vol.47).</ref>\n\nDuring those campaigns, visits would be paid to restrain the tribes. In 658 such a visit was repelled, and a revolt broke out in 660 starting with the Sijie (\u601d\u7ed3), Bayegu (\u62d4\u91ce\u53e4), Pugu (\u4ec6\u9aa8) and Tongluo (\u540c\u7f57). The reason for this revolt is unclear, perhaps due to the Chinese repression of the surrounding tribes during the campaigns.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 472\u2013475.</ref> Two years later the revolts were suppressed by the Chinese at the upper [[Selenge River]] around [[Khangai Mountains|Khangai]]. The battle was short, and a massacre was said to be committed by the two leading commanders. According to one exaggerated account from [[Tang Huiyao]] around 900,000 surrendered tribesmen were slaughtered, though it is certain that a large number of them were captured.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 477\u2013478.</ref> After the event, a message was sent to the north to appease the restless Tiele.\n\nIn 669 similar unsuccessful revolts had been made by the Xueyantuo, but the details of these are vague.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 479\u2013481.</ref> The last revolt was mentioned in 686, led by the Pugu and Tongluo to join with the Ashina clan, who had formed the [[Second Turkic Khaganate]] under [[Ilterish Qaghan]] in 682. They were immediately suppressed by an army dispatched from [[Juyan]]. A number of them were moved to that region along with the seat of the protectorate under the jurisdiction of [[Zhangye|Ganzhou]]. Earlier during the rebellion contacts between the northern protectorate and the Chinese capital were cut off, and the only way to pass was through the area of [[Jiuquan|Suzhou]].<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 482\u2013488.</ref>\n\n=== Rise of the Uyghur Khaganate ===\n{{Main article|Uyghur Khaganate}}\nAfter the disintegration of the Eastern Qaghanate in 630, many G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk nobles were resettled either at the Chinese border or in the capital. Some went on to participate in frontier campaigns for the Chinese.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 413.</ref><ref>Bo Yang, \"Zizhi Tongjian\", p. 11,660 (Vol.46).</ref>\n\nIn 679 a major rebellion was led by three G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk nobles{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. Among them, Ashina Nishufu (\u963f\u53f2\u90a3\u6ce5\u719f\u5310), a direct descendant of Illig, was chosen as their qaghan. They were quickly subdued by the Chinese and their leader was betrayed and killed by his own troops. The rest of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks managed to escape and allied themselves with Ashina Funian (\u963f\u53f2\u90a3\u4f0f\u5ff5) for a new rebellion. Funian declared himself qaghan in 681, but his revolt did not succeed and more than fifty participants were executed on November 16 at the Chinese capital.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 481, 483.</ref><ref>Bo Yang, \"Zizhi Tongjian\", p. 12,265, 12,273, 12,284, 12,292 (Vol.48).</ref> The remaining rebellious G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks formed the Second Turkic Eastern Qaghanate under Ilteris Sad and his 5,000 supporters. They were mostly active in the southern region bordering China at mount \u010co\u03b3ay (\u603b\u6750\u5c71). Over the decade they held countless raids across the Chinese border.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 483, 495.</ref>\n\nExactly when or how the Tiele came under their subjection is unclear. However, during this period, a number of pro-Chinese Tiele groups who had earlier cooperated with the Chinese against them, such as Uyghur, Qibi, Sijie and Hun (\u6d51), escaped into the [[Hexi Corridor]] and eventually resettled to [[Wuwei, Gansu|Liangzhou]].\n\nAccording to the Tonyukuk and K\u00fcltigin [[Orkhon script]], the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks made five out of forty-seven attacks on the Tiele who were led by Ilteris. Among them, four seem to have been mere raids while the last attack could be seen as their re-subjection on the northern steppe. The estimated date for the Tiele submission to the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks would be around 687, probably without much resistance.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 484, 501\u2013505, 523.</ref>\n\nThe establishment of a second G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk capital at the foot of the sacred mountain \u00d6t\u00fcken (\u90fd\u65a4\u5c71) brought unrest to the Tiele tribes. After the Uyghur chief was killed, they were recruited for their annual raiding campaigns over the Chinese border after 694.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 434, 505\u2013509.</ref> These raids were halted in 708, as the Chinese constructed fortifications along the Ordos. Raids continued elsewhere as [[Qapagan Khan|Qapagan]] turned his attention to the west and the [[Turgesh]] and [[Karl\u00edk|Qarluq]] tribes between 708 and 715. By this time, some of the Tiele had escaped into China and were settled in [[Yinchuan|Lingzhou]] and elsewhere, while others like the Bayegu had revolted in 707. These revolts continued until 716 and Qapagan, on his way back from suppressing revolts by the Uyghur, Tongluo, Baixi, Bayegu and Pugu, was ambushed and killed by a Bayegu tribesman named Xiezhilue (\u9889\u8d28\u7565) on July 22. In conclusion, not all tribes were involved in the revolts. Two of the northernmost tribal allies, the Guligan and Dubo (\u90fd\u64ad) did not participate in any of the revolts.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 509\u2013511, 515.</ref><ref>Bo Yang, \"Zizhi Tongjian\", p. 12,852 (Vol.50).</ref>\n\nSoon, [[Bilge Khan]] took over the reign and together with [[Tonyukuk]], began to appease the subjected Tiele. Tonyukuk was born in China and was considered a wise statesman in both Turkic and Chinese accounts. Meanwhile, a friendly relationship was built with the Chinese. Till the end of the Second Eastern Qaghanate only one raid in 720 was made on the Chinese border. Bilge Khan started to call for a return of the former members of the Tiele tribes who had settled in China. He had risen in status among the tribal chiefs, especially the Uyghur within the Qaghanate.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 517\u2013520.</ref>\n\nDuring this period, many Tiele had betrayed the local Chinese authorities and fled to the north, in particular the five communities around Liang, Ling, [[Yulin, Shaanxi|Xia]], [[Baynnur|Feng]], and [[Shuozhou|Bingzhou]], while minor insurgencies had occurred throughout the process.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 532\u2013539.</ref> Among the returning Tiele tribes was the Uyghur, specifically the Yaoluoge, who had escaped into China until 727.

Within a few years, an alliance was established between the [[Basmyl]] (\u62d4\u6089\u871c), Uyghur and Qarluq. They overthrew the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks and killed the qaghan. Most of the heirs were killed subsequently. At the same time the Basmyl chief, who was approved as qaghan, was overthrown by the allies.\n\nIn 745 the exiled qaghan of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks was killed by an Uyghur chief named Qutlugh Boyla, son of Hushu (\u62a4\u8f93).

The group managed to assemble a 30-Watt radio transmitter from surplus parts bought at Raon Street in [[Quiapo, Manila|Quiapo]], [[Manila]]. [[Henry Canoy]] broke the airwaves as a [[Pirate radio]] station in 1949, declaring '''\"This is Cagayan de Oro calling...\"'''. Because the broadcast was not authorized by the [[National Telecommunications Commission (Philippines)|Radio Control Office (RCO)]], it did not contain call letters.\n\nIn 1950 [[Henry Canoy|Canoy]], at the insistence of his brother, lawyer Reuben R. Canoy, decided to establish a more powerful radio station and applied for a congressional franchise in [[Manila]] to support its lawful operation. In 1951, he set up the fledgling station in partnership with Robin Cui, Max Suniel, Oscar Neri and Andres Bacal as equity partners with P10,000 in capital. on 23 June 1952 he was granted a permit to maintain and operate the radio broadcasting station.\n\nUsing the ''[[Radio Amateur's Handbook]]'' as their guide and also with surplus parts bought from Raon in [[Quiapo, Manila|Quiapo]], [[Manila]], they built their own 500-watt [[amplitude modulation|AM]] [[transmitter]] with the assistance from Far East Broadcasting Company [[engineers]], [[United States|American]] Dick Rowland and Byrd Bruneimer. The transmitter was transported to Mindanao aboard the boat MV Snug Hitch. With only a telescopic steel pole as antenna borrowed from the [[National Telecommunications Commission (Philippines)|Bureau of Telecom]], the improvised horizontal radio antenna was mounted by the team which include Ongkoy Padero, former vice president for engineering of CEPALCO, attaching one end of a copper wire to the pole and the other end to a 30&nbsp;meters [[coconut]] [[tree]] a block away . While their first \u201ctransmitter building\u201d was financed with a P5,000 \u201cduck farm\u201d loan from the [[Philippine National Bank]]. The [[National Telecommunications Commission (Philippines)|Radio Control Office (RCO)]] headed by Mr Jose Viado, assigned the station a broadcast frequency of 1560&nbsp;kHz.\n\nOn July 4, 1952, it went on air for test broadcast the second time coinciding with the birthday of his mother. It officially started broadcasting on August 28, 1952, also coinciding with the [[town]] [[festival|fiesta]] of [[Augustine of Hippo|San Agustin]], the patron [[saint]] of [[Cagayan de Oro]] [[archdiocese]]. Listeners anticipated the first words they would hear on radio and were greeted the station ID and the following words: \u201cYou are tuned to Station DXCC, broadcasting with a power of 500 watts on 1560 kHz from Cagayan de Oro\u2019s Gateway to Mindanao!\u201d and every hour thereafter. The stations first [[live radio|live broadcast]] coincides with its opening and the program involves the airing of a 3-hour '''\u201cAnejo Rum\u201d show''' from Plaza Divisoria, a central park in downtown Cagayan de Oro, for which Canoy billed [[San Miguel Corporation|La Tondena]] executive Hugo Chan Hong the sum of P500 as payment for the radio coverage.  The Radio signal was able to reach Del Monte Pacific [[plantation]] in [[Bukidnon]] {{convert|30|km}} away and as far as [[Australia]] through [[ham radio]] operations which managed to call back.<ref>[http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/62756 Henry R. Canoy, 84]</ref> (RMN The Henry R. Canoy Story, ISBN ?, Copyright 1997)\n\nIn 1954, Henry R. Canoy visited the [[United States]] under an observation grant. Instead of going to the giant networks and other big cities, he opted to be taken to a small town of [[Greeley, Colorado]], and he came upon a station that was doing exactly what DXCC was already trying to do in Mindanao. Its broadcast fare was peppered with farm prices, market and road conditions, weather warnings and personal messages. He came back with the blueprint for DXCC, which is entertainment, information and most of all education to the public.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19991129040626/http://rmn.com.ph/ About Us, retrieved on May 29, 2008].</ref>\n\nThe success of its broadcasting concept enabled DXCC to expand to [[Iligan]], then to [[Butuan]] and [[Davao City|Davao]]. By 1957, the station with a coconut tree for an antenna had given birth to four others. And so the string of community stations became '''Radio Mindanao Network''' (RMN).\n\nIn 1962, RMN's approach to broadcasting drew the interest of another visionary business leader, the late Andres Soriano Sr. of [[San Miguel Corporation]] who eventually bought the majority shares of RMN and brought the radio network to [[Manila]], the first provincial station to do so. \"The Sound of the City\" concept was born with the establishment of DZHP in the Greater Manila Area. Its format was strictly music and news. RMN joined forces with the Philippine Herald and [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|Inter-Island Broadcasting Corporation]] to form the powerful first tri-media organization. That association gave RMN at the forefront of broadcast journalism and public service. Other \"Sound of the City\" stations soon followed in [[Iloilo]] in 1962 (DYRI), [[Cebu]] in 1963 (DYHP), DZHB in [[Baguio]] and DXHP in [[Cagayan de Oro]] in 1968.\n\nIn 1968, RMN made a \"first\" in Philippine radio history by initiating the national [[newscasts]] via [[microwave]]. Fast, direct and crystal clear network newscasts emanating from the Tri-Media News Central in Manila brought the events as they happened in all parts of the country via stations DZHP in [[Manila]], DZHB in [[Baguio]], DYHP in [[Cebu]], DXVM in [[Cagayan de Oro]] and DXDC in [[Davao City|Davao]].\n\nFrom 1969 to 1970 three more community stations emerged - DXRS in [[Surigao City|Surigao]] and DZHN in [[Naga City, Camarines Sur|Naga]]. In early 1972, station DXHP in Cagayan de Oro was transferred to [[Bislig]], [[Surigao del Sur]]. By 1972, RMN had twelve (12) AM stations under its wings.\n\nIn 1973, with a constitutional limitation prohibiting the ownership of media by non-Filipinos or corporations not 100% Filipino owned, Henry Canoy's group brought out the Soriano-San Miguel group holdings in RMN.\n\nIn 1975, the call letters of the Manila flagship station, DZHP was changed to DWXL. Together with this, English programming gave way to Filipino. RMN's AM stations were broadcasting in three major dialects, Filipino, Cebuano and Ilonggo. Noted columnist Teodoro Valencia joined RMN as its Chairman of the Board. Under his guidance RMN was able to secure a loan from the [[Development Bank of the Philippines]] to finance its massive expansion and development program. A Cebuano drama production center based in DYHP-Cebu was established and subsequently followed by an Ilonggo drama production center based in DYHB-Bacolod.\n\nIn 1978, RMN's major expansion program was launched which include the upgrading of the technical facilities of its existing stations and the establishment of additional AM and FM stations. Among the stations that were added to the roster of RMN stations were: DXVM-FM in [[Cagayan de Oro]], DXXL-FM in [[Davao City|Davao]], DYXL-FM in [[Cebu]], [[DWKC-FM]] in [[Metro Manila]] & [[DXKR-AM]] in [[Marbel, South Cotabato]]. DWHB-FM in [[Baguio]] opened in 1980. DXDR-AM in [[Dipolog]] & DXPR in [[Pagadian]] was added in 1981.\n\nRMN also increased its coverage by entering into tie-up arrangements with smaller networks. Under this scheme, RMN provided programming, marketing, technical and management expertise where these small stations would be found wanting. This gave birth to a new name for these stations under the RMN umbrella - '''Radio Mindanao Network, Inc. and Associates'''.\n\nIn 1985, the programming of all RMN FM stations were also re-oriented to cater to a younger pop music audience. This was in line with the network's philosophy of positioning to be No.1 in listenership ratings. To give more emphasis to the emerging FM station market, RMN also divided its operations into two Operating Divisions, AM and FM. During the early 90s, DYHP in Cebu was also aired their programs via satellite thru the stations DYHD in Tagbilaran, DYRR in Ormoc, DYWC in Dumaguete, DYRS in San Carlos, DXDR in Dipolog and DXRS in Surigao.\n\nIn 1990, RMN undertook another major expansion program which entailed the addition of seven FM radio stations. A permit for RMN's first TV station located in Cagayan de Oro City was also granted.\n\nIn April 18, 1991, [[President (government title)|President]] [[Corazon Aquino]] signed into law Republic Act 6980 entitled \"An Act Renewing the Franchise Granted to Radio Mindanao Network, Inc. under Republic Act Numbered Thirty-One Hundred Twenty-Two to another Twenty-Five (25) years from the date of approval of this Act\". This was the first broadcast franchise approved under President Aquino's term of office.\n\nOn August 28, 1991, TV-8, RMN's first television station went on the air in Cagayan de Oro City. RMN-TV 8 was then an affiliate of the then newly established [[TV5 Network, Inc.|Associated Broadcasting Company]] from 1992 to 1995. Thirty nine years after its start, RMN was now venturing into television. In December 1991, RMN was also granted a permit to operate a UHF television station in Metro Manila (which was led to officially started two years later, on October 31, 1993; the frequency was now used by [[Broadcast Enterprises and Affiliated Media]], Inc. (thru [[Globe Telecom]]'s then-subsidiary [[Altimax Broadcasting Company]])).\n\nIn 1998, it went global by establishing the first Philippine radio station to conquer the [[United States]] airwaves through [[#WRMN New York|WRMN]] in [[New York City]].\n\nIn June 2007, RMN fm station DWKC 93.9 in [[Manila]] was the first commercial station in the country to broadcast with [[HD Radio]] technology. It broadcast in three HD Radio digital audio channels along with its pre-existing analog signal. The operation of its facility was in high-level combined hybrid mode with an existing 35&nbsp;kW analog transmitter, a new [[Nautel]] 1&nbsp;kW HD Radio transmitter, with the digital exciter, importer and exporter providing the digital signal component.<ref>[http://radiomagonline.com/digital_radio_update/digital_radio_update_060607/ Multicasting Signs On in the Philippines ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527201029/http://radiomagonline.com/digital_radio_update/digital_radio_update_060607/ |date=2008-05-27 }}</ref>\n\n===Television===\nWith the acquisition of Radio Mindanao Network by Andr\u00e9s Soriano, Sr. in 1962, RMN, together with the television network [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|Inter-Island Broadcasting Corporation]] (IBC) formed its first ever tri-media organization in the Philippines along with newspaper, Philippine Herald. As the ''de facto'' television arm of the RMN, IBC partnered with the RMN radio stations for coverages of the [[1969 Philippine general election|general elections of 1969]] and [[1971 Philippine Senate election|1971]].\n\nHowever, on February 1, 1975, during the [[Proclamation No. 1081|martial law]] era, due to a constitutional limitation prohibiting the ownership of media by non-Filipinos or corporations not 100% Filipino owned, the network was sold to a [[Marcos crony]] named [[Roberto Benedicto]], who also owned [[Radio Philippines Network|Kanlaon Broadcasting System]] (KBS), and was renamed Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation. IBC later sequestered by the [[Government of the Philippines|government]] following the [[EDSA Revolution]] in 1986.\n\nOn October 31, 1993, Radio Mindanao Network became the second radio-based network to launch a TV network called Cinema Television (CTV) through its flagship station, [[DWKC-TV]] and other regional stations. An all-movie channel, its programming included a presentation of Filipino  and [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] movies respectively, and programs from [[E!]], an American cable channel.

The group managed to assemble a 30-Watt radio transmitter from surplus parts bought at Raon Street in [[Quiapo, Manila|Quiapo]], [[Manila]]. [[Henry Canoy]] broke the airwaves as a [[Pirate radio]] station in 1949, declaring '''\"This is Cagayan de Oro calling...\"'''. Because the broadcast was not authorized by the [[National Telecommunications Commission (Philippines)|Radio Control Office (RCO)]], it did not contain call letters.\n\nIn 1950 [[Henry Canoy|Canoy]], at the insistence of his brother, lawyer Reuben R. Canoy, decided to establish a more powerful radio station and applied for a congressional franchise in [[Manila]] to support its lawful operation. In 1951, he set up the fledgling station in partnership with Robin Cui, Max Suniel, Oscar Neri and Andres Bacal as equity partners with P10,000 in capital. on 23 June 1952 he was granted a permit to maintain and operate the radio broadcasting station.\n\nUsing the ''[[Radio Amateur's Handbook]]'' as their guide and also with surplus parts bought from Raon in [[Quiapo, Manila|Quiapo]], [[Manila]], they built their own 500-watt [[amplitude modulation|AM]] [[transmitter]] with the assistance from Far East Broadcasting Company [[engineers]], [[United States|American]] Dick Rowland and Byrd Bruneimer. The transmitter was transported to Mindanao aboard the boat MV Snug Hitch. With only a telescopic steel pole as antenna borrowed from the [[National Telecommunications Commission (Philippines)|Bureau of Telecom]], the improvised horizontal radio antenna was mounted by the team which include Ongkoy Padero, former vice president for engineering of CEPALCO, attaching one end of a copper wire to the pole and the other end to a 30&nbsp;meters [[coconut]] [[tree]] a block away . While their first \u201ctransmitter building\u201d was financed with a P5,000 \u201cduck farm\u201d loan from the [[Philippine National Bank]]. The [[National Telecommunications Commission (Philippines)|Radio Control Office (RCO)]] headed by Mr Jose Viado, assigned the station a broadcast frequency of 1560&nbsp;kHz.\n\nOn July 4, 1952, it went on air for test broadcast the second time coinciding with the birthday of his mother. It officially started broadcasting on August 28, 1952, also coinciding with the [[town]] [[festival|fiesta]] of [[Augustine of Hippo|San Agustin]], the patron [[saint]] of [[Cagayan de Oro]] [[archdiocese]]. Listeners anticipated the first words they would hear on radio and were greeted the station ID and the following words: \u201cYou are tuned to Station DXCC, broadcasting with a power of 500 watts on 1560 kHz from Cagayan de Oro\u2019s Gateway to Mindanao!\u201d and every hour thereafter. The stations first [[live radio|live broadcast]] coincides with its opening and the program involves the airing of a 3-hour '''\u201cAnejo Rum\u201d show''' from Plaza Divisoria, a central park in downtown Cagayan de Oro, for which Canoy billed [[San Miguel Corporation|La Tondena]] executive Hugo Chan Hong the sum of P500 as payment for the radio coverage.  The Radio signal was able to reach Del Monte Pacific [[plantation]] in [[Bukidnon]] {{convert|30|km}} away and as far as [[Australia]] through [[ham radio]] operations which managed to call back.<ref>[http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/62756 Henry R. Canoy, 84]</ref> (RMN The Henry R. Canoy Story, ISBN ?, Copyright 1997)\n\nIn 1954, Henry R. Canoy visited the [[United States]] under an observation grant. Instead of going to the giant networks and other big cities, he opted to be taken to a small town of [[Greeley, Colorado]], and he came upon a station that was doing exactly what DXCC was already trying to do in Mindanao. Its broadcast fare was peppered with farm prices, market and road conditions, weather warnings and personal messages. He came back with the blueprint for DXCC, which is entertainment, information and most of all education to the public.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19991129040626/http://rmn.com.ph/ About Us, retrieved on May 29, 2008].</ref>\n\nThe success of its broadcasting concept enabled DXCC to expand to [[Iligan]], then to [[Butuan]] and [[Davao City|Davao]]. By 1957, the station with a coconut tree for an antenna had given birth to four others. And so the string of community stations became '''Radio Mindanao Network''' (RMN).\n\nIn 1962, RMN's approach to broadcasting drew the interest of another visionary business leader, the late Andres Soriano Sr. of [[San Miguel Corporation]] who eventually bought the majority shares of RMN and brought the radio network to [[Manila]], the first provincial station to do so. \"The Sound of the City\" concept was born with the establishment of DZHP in the Greater Manila Area. Its format was strictly music and news. RMN joined forces with the Philippine Herald and [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|Inter-Island Broadcasting Corporation]] to form the powerful first tri-media organization. That association gave RMN at the forefront of broadcast journalism and public service. Other \"Sound of the City\" stations soon followed in [[Iloilo]] in 1962 (DYRI), [[Cebu]] in 1963 (DYHP), DZHB in [[Baguio]] and DXHP in [[Cagayan de Oro]] in 1968.\n\nIn 1968, RMN made a \"first\" in Philippine radio history by initiating the national [[newscasts]] via [[microwave]]. Fast, direct and crystal clear network newscasts emanating from the Tri-Media News Central in Manila brought the events as they happened in all parts of the country via stations DZHP in [[Manila]], DZHB in [[Baguio]], DYHP in [[Cebu]], DXVM in [[Cagayan de Oro]] and DXDC in [[Davao City|Davao]].\n\nFrom 1969 to 1970 three more community stations emerged - DXRS in [[Surigao City|Surigao]] and DZHN in [[Naga City, Camarines Sur|Naga]]. In early 1972, station DXHP in Cagayan de Oro was transferred to [[Bislig]], [[Surigao del Sur]]. By 1972, RMN had twelve (12) AM stations under its wings.\n\nIn 1973, with a constitutional limitation prohibiting the ownership of media by non-Filipinos or corporations not 100% Filipino owned, Henry Canoy's group brought out the Soriano-San Miguel group holdings in RMN.\n\nIn 1975, the call letters of the Manila flagship station, DZHP was changed to DWXL. Together with this, English programming gave way to Filipino. RMN's AM stations were broadcasting in three major dialects, Filipino, Cebuano and Ilonggo. Noted columnist Teodoro Valencia joined RMN as its Chairman of the Board. Under his guidance RMN was able to secure a loan from the [[Development Bank of the Philippines]] to finance its massive expansion and development program. A Cebuano drama production center based in DYHP-Cebu was established and subsequently followed by an Ilonggo drama production center based in DYHB-Bacolod.\n\nIn 1978, RMN's major expansion program was launched which include the upgrading of the technical facilities of its existing stations and the establishment of additional AM and FM stations. Among the stations that were added to the roster of RMN stations were: DXVM-FM in [[Cagayan de Oro]], DXXL-FM in [[Davao City|Davao]], DYXL-FM in [[Cebu]], [[DWKC-FM]] in [[Metro Manila]] & [[DXKR-AM]] in [[Marbel, South Cotabato]]. DWHB-FM in [[Baguio]] opened in 1980. DXDR-AM in [[Dipolog]] & DXPR in [[Pagadian]] was added in 1981.\n\nRMN also increased its coverage by entering into tie-up arrangements with smaller networks. Under this scheme, RMN provided programming, marketing, technical and management expertise where these small stations would be found wanting. This gave birth to a new name for these stations under the RMN umbrella - '''Radio Mindanao Network, Inc. and Associates'''.\n\nIn 1985, the programming of all RMN FM stations were also re-oriented to cater to a younger pop music audience. This was in line with the network's philosophy of positioning to be No.1 in listenership ratings. To give more emphasis to the emerging FM station market, RMN also divided its operations into two Operating Divisions, AM and FM. During the early 90s, DYHP in Cebu was also aired their programs via satellite thru the stations DYHD in Tagbilaran, DYRR in Ormoc, DYWC in Dumaguete, DYRS in San Carlos, DXDR in Dipolog and DXRS in Surigao.\n\nIn 1990, RMN undertook another major expansion program which entailed the addition of seven FM radio stations. A permit for RMN's first TV station located in Cagayan de Oro City was also granted.\n\nIn April 18, 1991, [[President (government title)|President]] [[Corazon Aquino]] signed into law Republic Act 6980 entitled \"An Act Renewing the Franchise Granted to Radio Mindanao Network, Inc. under Republic Act Numbered Thirty-One Hundred Twenty-Two to another Twenty-Five (25) years from the date of approval of this Act\". This was the first broadcast franchise approved under President Aquino's term of office.\n\nOn August 28, 1991, TV-8, RMN's first television station went on the air in Cagayan de Oro City. RMN-TV 8 was then an affiliate of the then newly established [[TV5 Network, Inc.|Associated Broadcasting Company]] from 1992 to 1995. Thirty nine years after its start, RMN was now venturing into television. In December 1991, RMN was also granted a permit to operate a UHF television station in Metro Manila (which was led to officially started two years later, on October 31, 1993; the frequency was now used by [[Broadcast Enterprises and Affiliated Media]], Inc. (thru [[Globe Telecom]]'s then-subsidiary [[Altimax Broadcasting Company]])).\n\nIn 1998, it went global by establishing the first Philippine radio station to conquer the [[United States]] airwaves through [[#WRMN New York|WRMN]] in [[New York City]].\n\nIn June 2007, RMN fm station DWKC 93.9 in [[Manila]] was the first commercial station in the country to broadcast with [[HD Radio]] technology. It broadcast in three HD Radio digital audio channels along with its pre-existing analog signal. The operation of its facility was in high-level combined hybrid mode with an existing 35&nbsp;kW analog transmitter, a new [[Nautel]] 1&nbsp;kW HD Radio transmitter, with the digital exciter, importer and exporter providing the digital signal component.<ref>[http://radiomagonline.com/digital_radio_update/digital_radio_update_060607/ Multicasting Signs On in the Philippines ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527201029/http://radiomagonline.com/digital_radio_update/digital_radio_update_060607/ |date=2008-05-27 }}</ref>\n\n===Television===\nWith the acquisition of Radio Mindanao Network by Andr\u00e9s Soriano, Sr. in 1962, RMN, together with the television network [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|Inter-Island Broadcasting Corporation]] (IBC) formed its first ever tri-media organization in the Philippines along with newspaper, Philippine Herald. As the ''de facto'' television arm of the RMN, IBC partnered with the RMN radio stations for coverages of the [[1969 Philippine general election|general elections of 1969]] and [[1971 Philippine Senate election|1971]].\n\nHowever, on February 1, 1975, during the [[Proclamation No. 1081|martial law]] era, due to a constitutional limitation prohibiting the ownership of media by non-Filipinos or corporations not 100% Filipino owned, the network was sold to a [[Marcos crony]] named [[Roberto Benedicto]], who also owned [[Radio Philippines Network|Kanlaon Broadcasting System]] (KBS), and was renamed Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation. IBC later sequestered by the [[Government of the Philippines|government]] following the [[EDSA Revolution]] in 1986.\n\nOn October 31, 1993, Radio Mindanao Network became the second radio-based network to launch a TV network called Cinema Television (CTV) through its flagship station, [[DWKC-TV]] and other regional stations. An all-movie channel, its programming included a presentation of Filipino  and [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] movies respectively, and programs from [[E!]], an American cable channel. It is the first [[Ultra High Frequency|UHF]] stations to be inspired by the format of a cable movie channel. It once clinched a top spot for its TV ratings in all UHF stations in Manila.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gaviola |first1=Gilbert |title=A good showing, a strong following, a bright future |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LpUVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2QoEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6592%2C5297183 |accessdate=7 January 2019 |publisher=[[Manila Standard]] |date=31 October 1994}}</ref>\n\nHowever, because of the broadcasting rules assigned by [[National Telecommunications Commission (Philippines)|National Telecommunications Commission]] and the matter that they acquired the broadcast rights from E!, CTV stopped its broadcast in September 2000.\n\nIn October 2000, E! and RMN announced its partnership to relaunch CTV into E!

Some of E!'s programs were brought to the Philippines and remade in a local version, one of which was ''Wild On! Philippines''. On June 1, 2003, RMN decided to cease their operations on TV due to financial constraints and poor television ratings, and somehow to focus only on their 2 radio networks (RMN and iFM). There were several religious groups who had wished to acquire block programming of E! Philippines, but RMN refused to accept their offers.\n\nDWKC-TV and other regional stations soon acquired by [[Broadcast Enterprises and Affiliated Media]] and resumed its operations in 2011.\n\nIn March 2016, president and chairman of RMN, Eric S. Canoy announced its intention to bid for \nthe acquisition of the government-sequestered TV network [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation]], as part of the government's efforts to privatize the network.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Monzon |first1=Alden M. |title=Invitation to bid for IBC-13 expected in April |url=http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=Corporate&title=invitation-to-bid-for-ibc-13-expected-in-april&id=124925 |publisher=[[BusinessWorld]] |accessdate=7 January 2019 |date=23 March 2016 |quote=\"We are interested in Channel 13 but subject to the conditions and terms of the reference of bidding\", Radio Mindanao Network Inc.

It later became [[UM Broadcasting Network]]. DXMC-AM is now the present-day [[DXWT|DXWT-FM]], which was converted into the FM band since 1988.\nThe second, dxAW, was established by Alfred James Wills, a retired US Army Signal Corps officer (The dxAW calls were used by the TV station in Davao (which is now known as [[DXAS-TV|DXAS-TV Channel 4]]) owned by [[ABS-CBN]] from 1967 to 1972.)  There were four others that operated in Butuan, Surigao, Pagadian and Ozamiz.\nDxCC-AM is the 7th legally operating radio station having been founded in 1952.<ref>[http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view/20080602-140162/Henry-Canoy-signs-off ''refer to 1''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602160806/http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view/20080602-140162/Henry-Canoy-signs-off |date=2008-06-02 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[5 (TV channel)|5]]\n* [[Catholic Media Network]]\n* [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation]] - former sister media company of RMN\n* [[Radio Corporation of the Philippines]]\n* [[Central Luzon Broadcasting Corporation|RadioWorld Broadcasting Corporation]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|www.rmn.ph}}\n* [http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=sports5_may20_2008 Farewell, Dear mentor]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080618030530/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/dav/2008/05/28/oped/jun.ledesma.sunbursts.html Sir Henry]\n* [http://www.gmanews.tv/story/95905/Arroyo-lauds-late-RMN-founder President Arroyo lauds late RMN founder]\n\n{{Radio Mindanao Network}}\n{{Radio in the Philippines}}\n{{Television in the Philippines}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Radio Mindanao Network}}\n[[Category:Radio Mindanao Network]]\n[[Category:Philippine radio networks]]\n[[Category:Mindanao]]\n[[Category:Radio stations in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Philippine television networks]]\n[[Category:Media companies of the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Media companies established in 1952]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1992]]\n[[Category:1952 establishments in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Makati]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toDXIC(link changed toDXIC-AM) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Mindanao_Network"}

Infill of the inner harbour began in the 1850's and accelerated with the arrival of the railroad resulting in the current day shape of downtown <ref>https://www.cgenarchive.org/toronto-lakeshores.html</ref>.  By 1858 the site was located between two warfs (Rees & Tinnings Warf). As land was expanded southward, it remained under Government control as possible locations of various Union Station expansions.  The majority of the land was still part of the lake up until the early 1900's. By 1925 The northern parcel of the property was turned into of Bayside Park, which had been part of an early proposal that was to have seen the lands south of the rail corridor transformed into an extensive lakeside park that followed today's Esplande. The remaining land was most likely under the control of Central Harbor Terminals<ref>https://maps.library.utoronto.ca/dvhmp/maps.html</ref>.\n\nIn the 1930s the property became the proposed home to [[Canada Post]]'s Toronto Postal Delivery Building.  In the 1920's a postal handling facility already existed in the east wing of the city's then New Union Station (Downtown Toronto's 3rd major train station)<ref>{{cite book |last=Filey |first=Mike |author-link= |date=1992 |title=A Toronto Album 2: More Glimpses of the City That Was|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=K0tIsZ_TAIoC&pg=PA43 |location=Toronto |publisher=Dundurn Press |page=43 |isbn=}}</ref>.

Modifications were made to the building to be more adequately equipped for postal delivery, after it was altered by the Department of National Defence.  After the refurbishment work was completed in 1948, the building now possessed the capability and equipment for proper mail sorting and other mailing functions. Though it was designed as a mail sorting warehouse it was also the home of Postal Station \"A\" which served mostly institutional & commercial clients.  The Ground floor was where the mail was dropped off by both railway carts and postal vans. Unsorted mail was moved by conveyor belts to the top floor and via gravity fed mail chutes sorted by size & destination.  Eventually the sorted mail would end up back on the ground floor where it would be sent out for delivery<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://torontoplaques.com/Pages/Toronto_Postal_Delivery_Building.html|title=History|language=en|access-date=April 16, 2020</ref>.

In a cost cutting move (part of larger overall service changes & cuts made to the Crown Corporation under the [[Brian Mulroney]] Conservatives), Canada Post decided to close the facility and move operations to an alternate more modern c.1970s letter processing faculty on nearby Eastern Avenue. A structure with easy access to highways was designed specificity for transport truck delivery of mail. By 1989, all of the old building's work was transferred here.<ref name=\":0\" />. The 1980s real estate boom saw the building site become surrounded by skyscrapers, hotels, convention centres, SkyDome stadium & condo towers.  In the early 1990s, real estate developers [[Bramalea (company)|Bramalea Ltd]] and [[Trizec Properties|Trizec]] arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post, and redevelop the site into a {{convert|230,000|m2|sqft|adj=on}} office, retail and residential space. Financial and development details of the purchase imposed various conditions prior to development, including rezoning by the city, remediation of soil contamination by Canada Post.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bramalea's Moves Shake Taxpayers|first=Stevie|last=Cameron|date=November 15, 1992|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\nDue to financial difficulties, the building's ownership was returned to Canada Post in 1993 and remained abandoned. The Toronto Raptors purchased the unused building from Canada Post the following year.<ref name=\"rapnba\">{{cite web| url=http://www.nba.com/raptors/history/raptors_history.html/| title=Laying the Groundwork for the NBA in Toronto| website=nba.com| accessdate=October 14, 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Postal terminal now Air Canada Centre.jpg|thumb|left|The arena retains the eastern & southern walls of the original postal structure built, through a process of [[facadism]].]]\nConstruction of the arena was started by the Toronto Raptors, under their initial ownership group headed by Canadian businessman [[John Bitove]]. In 1995, it had been decided that the NBA would expand into Canada. The Toronto Raptors were created and would need an indoor arena to play in. The Canada Post building was chosen to be the new home of the Raptors due to its downtown location and lot size. Other venues such as [[Exhibition Place]], North York Centre, Bay and Wellesley, and Bay and Dundas were also considered. The Canada Post building was purchased for {{CAD|60}} million.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Raptors initially played in SkyDome (now [[Rogers Centre]]) while the arena was constructed.<ref name=\"blogTo\">{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Bateman|title=That time the Raptors and the Maple Leafs moved to the ACC|url=http://www.blogto.com/city/2014/02/that_time_the_raptors_and_leafs_moved_to_the_acc/|website=blogTo|date=February 22, 2014|accessdate=December 4, 2017}}</ref> Groundbreaking took place in March 1997. The building retained the [[Art Deco]] Queenston limestone facade of the Toronto Postal Delivery Building along the east (along [[Bay Street]]) and south ([[Lake Shore Boulevard]]) walls of that structure, but the rest of the building (facing [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]]) was removed to make room for the arena, through the process of [[facadism]]. The original building is protected under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.\n\n====Arena 'Wars'====\nWhen MLGL ([[Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment|Maple Leaf Gardens, Limited]] at the time the controlling company of the Toronto Maple Leafs) lost out on their desire to be the franchise owners of the Raptors, competition between the two organizations heated up centred around venues. MLGL declined to allow Maple Leaf Gardens to be used for the NBA upstart as a result pushing Bitove to secure rights to have the Raptors' opening seasons played at SkyDome until construction of the new stadium to be complete.\n\nThe 1930s-era Maple Leaf Gardens was showing its age; the Maple Leafs in desperate desire for a new facility began developing plans for building an all-new stadium with one of the key criteria for the new location that it must be within close walking proximity to both the subway system and GO Transit. During the early stages of construction, MLGL floated to the media plans for their own plans to build a competing single-use stadium on adjacent property just to the north of the stadium atop the train sheds at Union Station (similar to how [[Madison Square Garden]] was constructed) as the new home for the Toronto Maple Leafs.<ref name=ArenaWars>{{cite news|title=Leafs ready to Move (Page 2)|first=Craig|last=Daniels|date=April 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Toronto Sun]]}}</ref> The reaction from Raptors was nothing but anger. \"This proposed (Maple Leaf) location really disturbs us\" stated team president Richard Peddie, who went on to say that they would fight the Leafs \"every step of the way\" and he didn't understand why the Leafs have refused to join with the Raptors at their site; claiming that the Leafs want to \"build virtually on top of us\".<ref name=\"ArenaWars\" /> The major problem of the Union Station proposal is the land that the stadium would be built on was actually City of Toronto land that was leased out to CN Rail and CP Rail, which were in a major, long-standing dispute over rent payments (dating back to 1969). As a result, MLGL offered the city $156 Million (1997 CAD) in cash & assets to settle any and all outstanding claims and to buy the air rights above the Union Station train platforms.\n\nDuring this period John Bitove who disputed over the future of the arena who as a result of a [[shotgun clause]] was forced to sell his stake to Allan Slaight (who wanted a joint arena deal with MLGL) and now with majority ownership immediately went into talks with MLGL which eventually purchased both the Raptors and their partially completed arena, which subsequently resulted in major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217&nbsp;million, MLGL increased the budget to $265&nbsp;million after taking control.<ref name=cost>{{cite news|title=Upgrades added to cost|first=David|last=Shoalts|date=February 17, 1999|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> The Raptors were twice fined a million dollars (which were donated to their charitable foundation) by the NBA for missing deadlines to begin construction of their new arena.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors' arena bites dust|last=Christe|first=James|date=May 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\n====Construction==== \nAfter the purchase of the Raptors and the Air Canada Centre the new owners entered into a design-build contract with PCL with the commitment to finish the stadium in 24-months by March 1st 1999<ref>https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/projects/2017/03/pcl-construction-reflects-on-building-the-air-canada-centre-1022273w</ref>.

This boosted Toronto's economy and led to further construction in the downtown core.

Infill of the inner harbour began in the 1850's and accelerated with the arrival of the railroad resulting in the current day shape of downtown <ref>https://www.cgenarchive.org/toronto-lakeshores.html</ref>.  By 1858 the site was located between two warfs (Rees & Tinnings Warf). As land was expanded southward, it remained under Government control as possible locations of various Union Station expansions.  The majority of the land was still part of the lake up until the early 1900's. By 1925 The northern parcel of the property was turned into of Bayside Park, which had been part of an early proposal that was to have seen the lands south of the rail corridor transformed into an extensive lakeside park that followed today's Esplande. The remaining land was most likely under the control of Central Harbor Terminals<ref>https://maps.library.utoronto.ca/dvhmp/maps.html</ref>.\n\nIn the 1930s the property became the proposed home to [[Canada Post]]'s Toronto Postal Delivery BuildingIn the 1920's a postal handling facility already existed in the east wing of the city's then new Union Station<ref>{{cite book |last=Filey |first=Mike |author-link= |date=1992 |title=A Toronto Album 2: More Glimpses of the City That Was|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=K0tIsZ_TAIoC&pg=PA43 |location=Toronto |publisher=Dundurn Press |page=43 |isbn=}}</ref>.

Modifications were made to the building to be more adequately equipped for postal delivery, after it was altered by the Department of National Defence.  After the refurbishment work was completed in 1948, the building now possessed the capability and equipment for proper mail sorting and other mailing functions. Though it was designed as a mail sorting warehouse it was also the home of Postal Station \"A\" which served mostly institutional & commercial clients.  The Ground floor was where the mail was dropped off by both railway carts and postal vans. Unsorted mail was moved by conveyor belts to the top floor and via gravity fed mail chutes sorted by size & destination.  Eventually the sorted mail would end up back on the ground floor where it would be sent out for delivery<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://torontoplaques.com/Pages/Toronto_Postal_Delivery_Building.html|title=History|language=en|access-date=April 16, 2020</ref>.

The sculptors son Louis Temporale jr. helped with restoration efforts in 1998 and in 2016 was still critical of the lack of protection of the artwork by stadium ownership for over 20 years.

In a cost cutting move (part of larger overall service changes & cuts made to the Crown Corporation under the [[Brian Mulroney]] Conservatives), Canada Post decided to close the facility and move operations to an alternate more modern c.1970s letter processing faculty on nearby Eastern Avenue. A structure with easy access to highways was designed specificity for transport truck delivery of mail. By 1989, all of the old building's work was transferred here.<ref name=\":0\" />. The 1980s real estate boom saw the building site become surrounded by skyscrapers, hotels, convention centres, SkyDome stadium & condo towers.  In the early 1990s, real estate developers [[Bramalea (company)|Bramalea Ltd]] and [[Trizec Properties|Trizec]] arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post, and redevelop the site into a {{convert|230,000|m2|sqft|adj=on}} office, retail and residential space. Financial and development details of the purchase imposed various conditions prior to development, including rezoning by the city, remediation of soil contamination by Canada Post.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bramalea's Moves Shake Taxpayers|first=Stevie|last=Cameron|date=November 15, 1992|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\nDue to financial difficulties, the building's ownership was returned to Canada Post in 1993 and remained abandoned. The Toronto Raptors purchased the unused building from Canada Post the following year.<ref name=\"rapnba\">{{cite web| url=http://www.nba.com/raptors/history/raptors_history.html/| title=Laying the Groundwork for the NBA in Toronto| website=nba.com| accessdate=October 14, 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Postal terminal now Air Canada Centre.jpg|thumb|left|The arena retains the eastern & southern walls of the original postal structure built, through a process of [[facadism]].]]\nConstruction of the arena was started by the Toronto Raptors, under their initial ownership group headed by Canadian businessman [[John Bitove]]. In 1995, it had been decided that the NBA would expand into Canada. The Toronto Raptors were created and would need an indoor arena to play in. The Canada Post building was chosen to be the new home of the Raptors due to its downtown location and lot size. Other venues such as [[Exhibition Place]], North York Centre, Bay and Wellesley, and Bay and Dundas were also considered. The Canada Post building was purchased for {{CAD|60}} million.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Raptors initially played in SkyDome (now [[Rogers Centre]]) while the arena was constructed.<ref name=\"blogTo\">{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Bateman|title=That time the Raptors and the Maple Leafs moved to the ACC|url=http://www.blogto.com/city/2014/02/that_time_the_raptors_and_leafs_moved_to_the_acc/|website=blogTo|date=February 22, 2014|accessdate=December 4, 2017}}</ref> Groundbreaking took place in March 1997. The building retained the [[Art Deco]] Queenston limestone facade of the Toronto Postal Delivery Building along the east (along [[Bay Street]]) and south ([[Lake Shore Boulevard]]) walls of that structure, but the rest of the building (facing [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]]) was removed to make room for the arena, through the process of [[facadism]]. The original building is protected under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.\n\n====Arena 'Wars'====\nWhen MLGL ([[Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment|Maple Leaf Gardens, Limited]] at the time the controlling company of the Toronto Maple Leafs) lost out on their desire to be the franchise owners of the Raptors, competition between the two organizations heated up centred around venues. MLGL declined to allow Maple Leaf Gardens to be used for the NBA upstart as a result pushing Bitove to secure rights to have the Raptors' opening seasons played at SkyDome until construction of the new stadium to be complete.\n\nThe 1930s-era Maple Leaf Gardens was showing its age; the Maple Leafs in desperate desire for a new facility began developing plans for building an all-new stadium with one of the key criteria for the new location that it must be within close walking proximity to both the subway system and GO Transit. During the early stages of construction, MLGL floated to the media plans for their own plans to build a competing single-use stadium on adjacent property just to the north of the stadium atop the train sheds at Union Station (similar to how [[Madison Square Garden]] was constructed) as the new home for the Toronto Maple Leafs.<ref name=ArenaWars>{{cite news|title=Leafs ready to Move (Page 2)|first=Craig|last=Daniels|date=April 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Toronto Sun]]}}</ref> The reaction from Raptors was nothing but anger. \"This proposed (Maple Leaf) location really disturbs us\" stated team president Richard Peddie, who went on to say that they would fight the Leafs \"every step of the way\" and he didn't understand why the Leafs have refused to join with the Raptors at their site; claiming that the Leafs want to \"build virtually on top of us\".<ref name=\"ArenaWars\" /> The major problem of the Union Station proposal is the land that the stadium would be built on was actually City of Toronto land that was leased out to CN Rail and CP Rail, which were in a major, long-standing dispute over rent payments (dating back to 1969). As a result, MLGL offered the city $156 Million (1997 CAD) in cash & assets to settle any and all outstanding claims and to buy the air rights above the Union Station train platforms.\n\nDuring this period John Bitove who disputed over the future of the arena who as a result of a [[shotgun clause]] was forced to sell his stake to Allan Slaight (who wanted a joint arena deal with MLGL) and now with majority ownership immediately went into talks with MLGL which eventually purchased both the Raptors and their partially completed arena, which subsequently resulted in major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217&nbsp;million, MLGL increased the budget to $265&nbsp;million after taking control.<ref name=cost>{{cite news|title=Upgrades added to cost|first=David|last=Shoalts|date=February 17, 1999|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> The Raptors were twice fined a million dollars (which were donated to their charitable foundation) by the NBA for missing deadlines to begin construction of their new arena.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors' arena bites dust|last=Christe|first=James|date=May 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\n====Construction==== \nAfter the purchase of the Raptors and the Air Canada Centre the new owners entered into a design-build contract with PCL with the commitment to finish the stadium in 24-months by March 1st 1999<ref>https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/projects/2017/03/pcl-construction-reflects-on-building-the-air-canada-centre-1022273w</ref>.

The Raptors had attempted to play the April 19 match at Maple Leaf Gardens, but were unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors Move Final Game to Hamilton|date=January 7, 1998|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://www.apnews.com/7027ff09054e45b3b7471205f12cb521}}</ref>\n[[File:Air Canada Centre in 1999.jpg|thumb|left|Air Canada Centre in July 1999, five months after the arena opened]]\n\nOn December 30th 1998, the building's construction was completed, 9 days ahead of schedule.

Renew our faith and be afraid of [[Allah]], as death is something that is genuine, and comes without invitation.\u201d After much blowback on social media, she temporarily closed her Twitter account.\n\n==Election results==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:95%\"\n|+ '''[[Dewan Rakyat|Parliament of Malaysia]]''': P23 [[Rantau Panjang (federal constituency)|Rantau Panjang]], Kelantan<ref name=\"election results\">{{cite web|url=http://semak.spr.gov.my/spr/laporan/5_KedudukanAkhir.php|title=Keputusan Pilihan Raya Umum Parlimen/Dewan Undangan Negeri|publisher=[[Election Commission of Malaysia]]|accessdate=27 May 2010}} Percentage figures based on total turnout.</ref><ref name=\"undiinfo\">{{cite web |url= http://undi.info/# | title = Malaysia General Election  | work =undiinfo Malaysian Election Data |publisher= [[Malaysiakini]] |accessdate= 19 April 2013}} Results only available from the [[2004 Malaysian general election|2004 election]] (GE11).</ref><ref name=\"PRU13\">{{cite web |url=http://resultpru13.spr.gov.my/module/keputusan/paparan/paparan_laporan.php |title=KEPUTUSAN PILIHAN RAYA UMUM 13|work=Sistem Pengurusan Maklumat Pilihan Raya Umum|publisher=[[Election Commission of Malaysia]]|language=Malay|accessdate=24 March 2017}}Results only available for the [[2013 Malaysian general election|2013 election]].</ref><ref name =\"myundi pru 13\">{{cite web |url=http://www.myundi.com.my/pru13/region.aspx |title=my undi : Kawasan & Calon-Calon PRU13 : Keputusan PRU13 (Archived copy) |website=www.myundi.com.my|accessdate=2014-04-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331000718/http://www.myundi.com.my/pru13/region.aspx |archivedate=31 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Utusan PRU 13 results\">{{cite web|url=http://ww2.utusan.com.my/utusan/special.asp?pr=PilihanRaya2013&pg=keputusan.htm|title=Keputusan Pilihan Raya Umum ke-13|work=[[Utusan Malaysia]]|accessdate=26 October 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"GE14 results\">{{cite web|url=https://keputusan.spr.gov.my/|title=SEMAKAN KEPUTUSAN PILIHAN RAYA UMUM KE -
