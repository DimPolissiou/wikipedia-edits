To protect against the cold, the [[udder]] in females and the [[scrotum]] in males are small and covered in a layer of hair. Females have four [[teat]]s. Both sexes have long shaggy hair with a dense woolly undercoat over the chest, flanks, and thighs for insulation against the cold. In males especially, this undercoat may form a long \"skirt\" that can reach the ground. The tail is long and horse-like rather than tufted like the tails of cattle or bison. The coat is typically black or dark brown covering most of the body, with a grey muzzle, although some wild golden-brown individuals have been reported. Wild yaks with gold coloured hair  are known as the Wild Golden Yak ({{zh|c={{linktext|\u91d1|\u8272|\u91ce|\u7266|\u725b}}|p=j\u012bns\u00e8y\u011b m\u00e1oni\u00fa}}).

Conflicts with herders themselves, as in preventive and retaliatory killings for abduction of domestic yaks by wild herds, also occur but appear to be relatively rare.

Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]], [[Pennsylvania]], USA, in the [[Monongahela River]] valley {{convert|7|mi|0}} southeast of downtown [[Pittsburgh]] and directly across the river from the city limit line. The borough is known for the [[Homestead Strike]] of 1892, an important event in the history of labor relations in the United States. The population of Homestead was 3,165 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{cite web| url=https://www.census.gov| title=Race, Hispanic or Latino, Age, and Housing Occupancy: 2010 Census Redistricting Data (Public Law 94-171) Summary File (QT-PL), Homestead borough, Pennsylvania| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]| accessdate=September 20, 2011}}</ref>\nAdam C. Walker - NFL Player Philadelphia Eagles/San Francisco 49ers and Business Executive\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Homestead map from the darlington collection.png|thumb|left|An early map of Homestead]]\nThe area on the south bank of the [[Monongahela River]] now comprising the boroughs of Homestead, [[Munhall, Pennsylvania|Munhall]] and [[West Homestead, Pennsylvania|West Homestead]] saw the first white settlers arrive in the 1770s. One hundred years later, much of the existing farmland on the flats and hillsides by the river was purchased, laid out in lots and sold by local banks and land owners to create the town of Homestead. The town was chartered in 1880. The building of a [[railroad]], [[glass]] factory, and in 1881 the first [[ironworks|iron mill]] began a period of rapid growth and prosperity. In 1883, [[Andrew Carnegie]] bought out [[Homestead Steel Works]], adding it to his empire of [[steel]] and [[coke (fuel)|coke]] enterprises. Carnegie had recently acquired a controlling interest in [[Henry Clay Frick]]'s coke works on the Monongahela, setting the stage for the dramatic labor clash in Homestead.\n\nHomestead gained international notoriety in July 1892 as the site of a violent clash between locked-out steelworkers and hired Pinkerton guards, known as the [[Homestead Strike]]. When Henry Clay Frick, manager for Andrew Carnegie, owner of the local Homestead Steel Works, announced in the spring of 1892 that skilled workers would receive a reduction in wages, the advisory committee of the [[Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers]] refused to sign a new contract. Carnegie's management locked the workforce out, declaring that the union would no longer be recognized at the steel works.\n\nTo break the strike and secure the mill from the disgruntled workers, industrialist [[Henry Clay Frick]] hired hundreds of armed toughs from the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency]]. When barges carrying the Pinkertons arrived at the mill on the morning of July 6, workers and townspeople met them at the riverbanks. Though eyewitness accounts differed on which side first fired a shot, a day-long armed battle ensued which resulted in eleven deaths and dozens of injuries. The governor of Pennsylvania eventually called out the [[Pennsylvania National Guard|National Guard]] to restore order to the town and take control of the mill. Frick successfully destroyed the union in Homestead and, by extension, in most of his other steel mills through the nation. The \"Battle of Homestead,\" as the event came to be known, represented a stunning setback for [[unionization]] in the highly mechanized steel industry. It also set the stage for the future [[steel strike of 1919]], in which Homestead played an important role.\n\n[[File:\"Steel for Victory\" - NARA - 534929.jpg|thumb|300px|right|\"Steel for Victory. Many scenes filmed at Homestead.\"]][[File:Frick to Carnegie letter about the arming of the Pinkertons.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Frick's letter to Carnegie describing the plans and munitions that will be on the barges when the Pinkertons arrive to confront the strikers in Homestead.]]\nAt the turn of the 20th century, in 1900, the population of Homestead was 12,554 people, of whom some 7,000 were employed in the plants. Due mostly to immigration from [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Southern Europe]], by 1910 the population jumped to 18,713, then to 20,452 in 1920. In the first decade of the 20th century, Homestead was studied as part of the sociological [[Pittsburgh Survey]], the results of which were eventually published as ''Homestead: The Households of a Mill Town''.\n\nIn 1940, 19,041 people lived in Homestead. During the early 1940s half the population was displaced as the United States government added to the steel mills to have the capacity for armor plating for ships and tanks (preparing for [[World War II]]).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=http://journals.psu.edu/wph/article/view/4133/3950|publisher=[[Pittsburgh History]]|accessdate=2015-02-10|date=2015-02-10|title=Engineering an Industrial Diaspora: Homestead, 1941}}</ref> After the end of the war, a decline in the steel-making industry of the [[United States]] took place.\n\nBy 1980, it had become difficult to obtain employment at the Homestead Works, which was not producing much steel at that time. In 1986, the mill closed.  The Homestead Works was demolished in the early 1990s, replaced in 1999 by [[The Waterfront]] shopping mall. As a direct result of the loss of mill employment, the number of people living in Homestead dwindled. By the time of the 2010 census, the borough population was 3,165. The borough began financially recovering in 2002, with the enlarging retail tax base.\n\n==Geography==\nHomestead is located at {{coord|40|24|18|N|79|54|28|W|type:city}} (40.405069, \u221279.907785).<ref name=\"CensusGazetteer\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|0.6|mi2}}, of which {{convert|0.6|mi2}} is land and {{convert|0.1|mi2}}, or 11.11%, is water.\n\n==Government and Politics==\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential Elections Results'''<ref>{{cite web|last1=EL|title=2012 Allegheny County election|url=http://triblive.com/politics/2907065-74/pittsburgh-ward-hills-west-borough-braddock-east-elizabeth-north-park|website=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=EL|title=2016 Pennsylvani general election...|url=http://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/electionresultsgen2016/|website=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

The [[population density]] was 6,281.6 people per square mile (2,417.5/km\u00b2). There were 2,071 housing units at an average density of 3,645.0 per square mile (1,402.8/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the borough was 42.64% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 51.30% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.25% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 2.83% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.03% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 0.22% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 2.72% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 0.62% of the population.\n\nThere were 1,607 households, out of which 24.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 23.3% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 24.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 47.5% were non-families. 42.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 19.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.16 and the average family size was 2.99.\n\nIn the borough the population was spread out, with 24.2% under the age of 18, 8.0% from 18 to 24, 25.1% from 25 to 44, 23.8% from 45 to 64, and 18.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 80.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 75.1 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the borough was $16,603, and the median income for a family was $28,314. Males had a median income of $25,500 versus $21,559 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the borough was $12,690. About 23.0% of families and 26.6% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 31.0% of those under age 18 and 16.8% of those age 65 or over.\n\n== Attractions ==\nAlso of interest is the [[Bost Building]], a restored brick structure that served as headquarters for the strikers during the 1892 strike by workers at Carnegie Steel. The Bost Building was declared a National Landmark in 1999. It is located at 621 East Eighth Avenue. It now houses a museum and visitors center of the Rivers of Steel Heritage Area.\n\nMuch of Homestead and some of the surrounding communities are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the [[Homestead Historic District]]. Many churches, commercial buildings, and homes date to the late 19th century or early 20th century and are of architectural and historic interest. Unfortunately, since the closing of the steel mills in the 1980s, the population and business district of Homestead have seriously declined, causing many older buildings to be abandoned. The final nail in the coffin of the formerly thriving business district, mainly along 8th Avenue, was the opening of many big box chain stores and restaurants in the new (1990s) Waterfront development.\n\nThe [[Carnegie Library]] of Homestead was opened to the public in 1898. This historic building, located on East 11th Avenue in the neighboring borough of Munhall, now houses, in addition to a public library, a music hall and athletic club open to the public. The impressive stone architecture of the building is set off by the surrounding park. The library is one of only three that Andrew Carnegie provided with an [[financial endowment|endowment]]. Some claim it was a peace offering to the community following the events of the steel strike in 1892, and that as such it was rejected by Homestead, which is why it is in Munhall instead. In fact, the plans were already in the works for the building of the library before the strike, and the Borough of Munhall had not been incorporated when the library was built.\n\nAlso not technically in Homestead proper, but located just west of the borough, is the popular [[waterpark]], Sandcastle, with waterslides, pools and waterside nightclub adjacent to the Monongahela River. Sandcastle's sister location for summertime fun is [[Kennywood]], located in [[West Mifflin, Pennsylvania|West Mifflin]], about {{convert|4|mi|0}} east of Homestead. This historic amusement park has been a family destination for generations of Pittsburghers. It is home to some of the best known and loved wooden roller coaster rides.\n\nIn 2000, Continental Realestate Companies opened [[The Waterfront]].  This large \"lifestyle\" shopping center was built on the former site of the [[Carnegie Steel]] Works.  Most of the structures associated with the steel mills on this site were demolished during construction. Still standing in the Waterfront development are some of the brick stacks from the [[Homestead Steel Works]]. In addition, near the river is a former mill structure known as the Pump House which was restored by the developer.\n\n== Transportation ==\nAn important state route, [[Pennsylvania Route 837]], runs through Homestead. [[Interstate 376]] is only a few miles away from Homestead. For public transit, the [[Port Authority of Allegheny County]] has several bus routes running through Homestead that go to downtown [[Pittsburgh]] and to [[McKeesport, Pennsylvania|McKeesport]].\n\nHomestead is served by three railroads: the [[Norfolk Southern]], [[CSX Transportation]] and the [[Union Railroad (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)|Union Railroad]]. All three used to have large operations when the Homestead steel mill was open. Now that the mill has closed, only one company, WHEMCO, is served by the railroad. The Union Railroad had a large [[rail yard|yard]] to serve the Homestead Works, which is now Waterfront Drive.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{further|:Category:People from Homestead, Pennsylvania}}\n*[[Charlie Batch]], [[NFL]] quarterback for the [[Detroit Lions]] and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]\n*[[William Campbell (business executive)|William Campbell]], business executive\n*[[John S.

One hundred years later, much of the existing farmland on the flats and hillsides by the river was purchased, laid out in lots and sold by local banks and land owners to create the town of Homestead. The town was chartered in 1880. The building of a [[railroad]], [[glass]] factory, and in 1881 the first [[ironworks|iron mill]] began a period of rapid growth and prosperity. In 1883, [[Andrew Carnegie]] bought out [[Homestead Steel Works]], adding it to his empire of [[steel]] and [[coke (fuel)|coke]] enterprises. Carnegie had recently acquired a controlling interest in [[Henry Clay Frick]]'s coke works on the Monongahela, setting the stage for the dramatic labor clash in Homestead.\n\nHomestead gained international notoriety in July 1892 as the site of a violent clash between locked-out steelworkers and hired Pinkerton guards, known as the [[Homestead Strike]]. When Henry Clay Frick, manager for Andrew Carnegie, owner of the local Homestead Steel Works, announced in the spring of 1892 that skilled workers would receive a reduction in wages, the advisory committee of the [[Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers]] refused to sign a new contract. Carnegie's management locked the workforce out, declaring that the union would no longer be recognized at the steel works.\n\nTo break the strike and secure the mill from the disgruntled workers, industrialist [[Henry Clay Frick]] hired hundreds of armed toughs from the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency]]. When barges carrying the Pinkertons arrived at the mill on the morning of July 6, workers and townspeople met them at the riverbanks. Though eyewitness accounts differed on which side first fired a shot, a day-long armed battle ensued which resulted in eleven deaths and dozens of injuries. The governor of Pennsylvania eventually called out the [[Pennsylvania National Guard|National Guard]] to restore order to the town and take control of the mill. Frick successfully destroyed the union in Homestead and, by extension, in most of his other steel mills through the nation. The \"Battle of Homestead,\" as the event came to be known, represented a stunning setback for [[unionization]] in the highly mechanized steel industry. It also set the stage for the future [[steel strike of 1919]], in which Homestead played an important role.\n\n[[File:\"Steel for Victory\" - NARA - 534929.jpg|thumb|300px|right|\"Steel for Victory. Many scenes filmed at Homestead.\"]][[File:Frick to Carnegie letter about the arming of the Pinkertons.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Frick's letter to Carnegie describing the plans and munitions that will be on the barges when the Pinkertons arrive to confront the strikers in Homestead.]]\nAt the turn of the 20th century, in 1900, the population of Homestead was 12,554 people, of whom some 7,000 were employed in the plants. Due mostly to immigration from [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Southern Europe]], by 1910 the population jumped to 18,713, then to 20,452 in 1920. In the first decade of the 20th century, Homestead was studied as part of the sociological [[Pittsburgh Survey]], the results of which were eventually published as ''Homestead: The Households of a Mill Town''.\n\nIn 1940, 19,041 people lived in Homestead. During the early 1940s half the population was displaced as the United States government added to the steel mills to have the capacity for armor plating for ships and tanks (preparing for [[World War II]]).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=http://journals.psu.edu/wph/article/view/4133/3950|publisher=[[Pittsburgh History]]|accessdate=2015-02-10|date=2015-02-10|title=Engineering an Industrial Diaspora: Homestead, 1941}}</ref> After the end of the war, a decline in the steel-making industry of the [[United States]] took place.\n\nBy 1980, it had become difficult to obtain employment at the Homestead Works, which was not producing much steel at that time. In 1986, the mill closed.  The Homestead Works was demolished in the early 1990s, replaced in 1999 by [[The Waterfront]] shopping mall. As a direct result of the loss of mill employment, the number of people living in Homestead dwindled. By the time of the 2010 census, the borough population was 3,165. The borough began financially recovering in 2002, with the enlarging retail tax base.\n\n==Geography==\nHomestead is located at {{coord|40|24|18|N|79|54|28|W|type:city}} (40.405069, \u221279.907785).<ref name=\"CensusGazetteer\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|0.6|mi2}}, of which {{convert|0.6|mi2}} is land and {{convert|0.1|mi2}}, or 11.11%, is water.\n\n==Government and Politics==\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential Elections Results'''<ref>{{cite web|last1=EL|title=2012 Allegheny County election|url=http://triblive.com/politics/2907065-74/pittsburgh-ward-hills-west-borough-braddock-east-elizabeth-north-park|website=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=EL|title=2016 Pennsylvani general election...|url=http://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/electionresultsgen2016/|website=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

The [[population density]] was 6,281.6 people per square mile (2,417.5/km\u00b2). There were 2,071 housing units at an average density of 3,645.0 per square mile (1,402.8/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the borough was 42.64% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 51.30% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.25% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 2.83% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.03% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 0.22% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 2.72% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 0.62% of the population.\n\nThere were 1,607 households, out of which 24.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 23.3% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 24.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 47.5% were non-families. 42.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 19.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.16 and the average family size was 2.99.\n\nIn the borough the population was spread out, with 24.2% under the age of 18, 8.0% from 18 to 24, 25.1% from 25 to 44, 23.8% from 45 to 64, and 18.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 80.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 75.1 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the borough was $16,603, and the median income for a family was $28,314. Males had a median income of $25,500 versus $21,559 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the borough was $12,690. About 23.0% of families and 26.6% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 31.0% of those under age 18 and 16.8% of those age 65 or over.\n\n== Attractions ==\nAlso of interest is the [[Bost Building]], a restored brick structure that served as headquarters for the strikers during the 1892 strike by workers at Carnegie Steel. The Bost Building was declared a National Landmark in 1999. It is located at 621 East Eighth Avenue. It now houses a museum and visitors center of the Rivers of Steel Heritage Area.\n\nMuch of Homestead and some of the surrounding communities are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the [[Homestead Historic District]]. Many churches, commercial buildings, and homes date to the late 19th century or early 20th century and are of architectural and historic interest. Unfortunately, since the closing of the steel mills in the 1980s, the population and business district of Homestead have seriously declined, causing many older buildings to be abandoned. The final nail in the coffin of the formerly thriving business district, mainly along 8th Avenue, was the opening of many big box chain stores and restaurants in the new (1990s) Waterfront development.\n\nThe [[Carnegie Library]] of Homestead was opened to the public in 1898. This historic building, located on East 11th Avenue in the neighboring borough of Munhall, now houses, in addition to a public library, a music hall and athletic club open to the public. The impressive stone architecture of the building is set off by the surrounding park. The library is one of only three that Andrew Carnegie provided with an [[financial endowment|endowment]]. Some claim it was a peace offering to the community following the events of the steel strike in 1892, and that as such it was rejected by Homestead, which is why it is in Munhall instead. In fact, the plans were already in the works for the building of the library before the strike, and the Borough of Munhall had not been incorporated when the library was built.\n\nAlso not technically in Homestead proper, but located just west of the borough, is the popular [[waterpark]], Sandcastle, with waterslides, pools and waterside nightclub adjacent to the Monongahela River. Sandcastle's sister location for summertime fun is [[Kennywood]], located in [[West Mifflin, Pennsylvania|West Mifflin]], about {{convert|4|mi|0}} east of Homestead. This historic amusement park has been a family destination for generations of Pittsburghers. It is home to some of the best known and loved wooden roller coaster rides.\n\nIn 2000, Continental Realestate Companies opened [[The Waterfront]].  This large \"lifestyle\" shopping center was built on the former site of the [[Carnegie Steel]] Works.  Most of the structures associated with the steel mills on this site were demolished during construction. Still standing in the Waterfront development are some of the brick stacks from the [[Homestead Steel Works]]. In addition, near the river is a former mill structure known as the Pump House which was restored by the developer.\n\n== Transportation ==\nAn important state route, [[Pennsylvania Route 837]], runs through Homestead. [[Interstate 376]] is only a few miles away from Homestead. For public transit, the [[Port Authority of Allegheny County]] has several bus routes running through Homestead that go to downtown [[Pittsburgh]] and to [[McKeesport, Pennsylvania|McKeesport]].\n\nHomestead is served by three railroads: the [[Norfolk Southern]], [[CSX Transportation]] and the [[Union Railroad (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)|Union Railroad]]. All three used to have large operations when the Homestead steel mill was open. Now that the mill has closed, only one company, WHEMCO, is served by the railroad. The Union Railroad had a large [[rail yard|yard]] to serve the Homestead Works, which is now Waterfront Drive.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{further|:Category:People from Homestead, Pennsylvania}}\n*[[Charlie Batch]], [[NFL]] quarterback for the [[Detroit Lions]] and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]\n*[[William Campbell (business executive)|William Campbell]], business executive\n*[[John S.

He visits some of the killers and their collaborators\u2014including his uncle\u2014under the pretense of an eye exam.

Out of concern for his safety, the man is not fully identified in the film and is credited only as \"anonymous,\" as are many of the film's crew positions. Some shots consist of the man watching (what seems to be) extra footage from ''The Act of Killing'', which includes video of the men who killed his brother. He visits some of the killers and their collaborators\u2014including his uncle\u2014under the pretense of an eye exam. Although none of the killers expresses any remorse, the daughter of one of them is clearly shaken when she hears, apparently for the first time, the details of the killings.\n\n==Release==\nThe film was screened in the official competition at the [[71st Venice International Film Festival]],<ref name=\"Venice\">{{cite web |url=http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/71st-festival/line-up/off-sel/venezia71/ |title=International competition of feature films |accessdate=24 July 2014 |work=Venice |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006083927/http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/71st-festival/line-up/off-sel/venezia71/ |archivedate=6 October 2014  }}</ref><ref name=\"Deadline\">{{cite web |url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/07/venice-film-festival-lineup-2014-movie-list/ |title=Venice Film Festival Lineup Announced |accessdate=24 July 2014 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]}}</ref> where it won the Grand Jury Prize, the International Film Critics Award ([[FIPRESCI]]), the Italian online critics award (Mouse d'Oro), the [[European Film Critics Award]] (FEDEORA), as well as the Human Rights Nights Award.<ref name=\"BBCAwards\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29098103 |title=Roy Andersson film scoops Venice Golden Lion award |date=7 September 2014 |accessdate=7 September 2014 |work=BBC News}}</ref> Since then, it has gone on to win multiple awards, including Best World Documentary (Cinephile Prize) at the [[Busan International Film Festival]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/busan-festival-announces-vision-awards-1201326583/|title=Busan Festival Announces Vision Awards|author=Patrick Frater|work=Variety}}</ref> the Grand Prize (DOX Award) at [[CPH:DOX]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/filmogtv/ECE2454846/joshua-oppenheimer-vinder-hovedprisen-paa-cphdox/|title=Joshua Oppenheimer vinder hovedprisen p\u00e5 CPH:DOX|work=politiken.dk}}</ref> the prize for Best Documentary at the Starz Denver Film Festival,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodintoto.com/viva-la-liberta-capturing-grace-starz-denver-film-festival-winners/|title='Viva la Liberta,' 'Capturing Grace' Win SDFF Awards|work=Hollywood in Toto}}</ref> a [[Danish Arts Council]] Award for outstanding achievement in filmmaking,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kunst.dk/kunstomraader/film/nyheder/tre-af-aarets-danske-film-udvalgt-af-statens-kunstfond/|title=Tre af \u00e5rets danske film udvalgt af Statens Kunstfond|work=kunst.dk}}</ref> and the Best Film Award at the [[One World human rights documentary film festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://oneworld.cz/2015/awarded-films|title = Awarded Films|date =11 March 2015|accessdate =12 March 2015|website = One World 2015 international human rights documentary film festival|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the film has screened at the [[Telluride Film Festival]], [[Toronto International Film Festival]], [[New York Film Festival]], [[Zurich Film Festival]], IDFA ([[International Documentary Festival Amsterdam]]), and MIFF ([[Melbourne International Film Festival]]).\n\nOn 10 November 2014, 2,000 people came to the official and public premiere of the film in Jakarta.

The ''rosanero'' ended the season in first place, being crowned Serie B champions and promoted to [[Serie A]] after 31 years in the lower divisions.\n\n==Summary==\nAmbitious Palermo failed to gain promotion to [[Serie A]] in the previous season following a 3-0 away defeat in the final match against [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]], which were promoted at Palermo's place<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914131104/http://www.ilpalermocalcio.it/it/0304/numeri.jsp|title= Season 2002-30 Palermo |publisher=ilpalermocalcio.it|language=Italian}}</ref>. That dramatic defeat was also the last appearance in his playing career for team captain [[Antonino Asta]], who seriously injured during the match and did not manage to recover; he was part of the first team squad in the season 2003-04, without however making a single appearance. Following the events, Palermo made a number of prominent signings in the summer market, such as [[Eugenio Corini]], [[Andrea Gasbarroni]] and [[Luca Toni]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2004/giugno/13/ultima_notte_Toni_ga_10_0406135443.shtml|publisher=gazzetta.it|title= The last night of Toni|language=Italian}}</ref>; in addition, Palermo-born star [[Gaetano Vasari]] agreed to join the ''rosanero'' with a salary based on the number of appearances he would have made in the season. [[Silvio Baldini]] was appointed as new boss to replace [[Nedo Sonetti]]. Several football pundits suggested Palermo to be the real favourite team to win the Serie B league because of the quality of its roster.\n\nThe team made a very impressive start by defeating [[Gianfranco Zola]]'s [[Cagliari Calcio]], and managed to be always in the promotion spots. However, following a surprising 3-1 home defeat to [[Salernitana Calcio 1919|Salernitana]] that brought Palermo down to third place, Baldini heavily criticized club chairman [[Maurizio Zamparini]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116150927/http://www.raisport.rai.it/pub/sezione/raiSportSezioneIndex/0%2C5785%2C_205_60_1416%2C00.html|title= Zamparini Interview|language=Italian|publisher=raisport.it}}</ref> who consequently fired him and appointed [[Francesco Guidolin]] at his place. On the last day of the January transfer market, three new notable signings were made: [[Antonio Filippini]], [[Emanuele Filippini]] and [[Fabio Grosso]]. Palermo later returned to top the table and eventually won the league, ending with the same points than Cagliari, but being crowned as Serie B champions due to head-to-head matches.\n\n==Squad==\n{{fs

The ''rosanero'' ended the season in first place, being crowned Serie B champions and promoted to [[Serie A]] after 31 years in the lower divisions.\n\n==Summary==\nAmbitious Palermo failed to gain promotion to [[Serie A]] in the previous season following a 3-0 away defeat in the final match against [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]], which were promoted at Palermo's place<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914131104/http://www.ilpalermocalcio.it/it/0304/numeri.jsp|title= Season 2002-30 Palermo |publisher=ilpalermocalcio.it|language=Italian}}</ref>. That dramatic defeat was also the last appearance in his playing career for team captain [[Antonino Asta]], who seriously injured during the match and did not manage to recover; he was part of the first team squad in the season 2003-04, without however making a single appearance. Following the events, Palermo made a number of prominent signings in the summer market, such as [[Eugenio Corini]], [[Andrea Gasbarroni]] and [[Luca Toni]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2004/giugno/13/ultima_notte_Toni_ga_10_0406135443.shtml|publisher=gazzetta.it|title= The last night of Toni|language=Italian}}</ref>; in addition, Palermo-born star [[Gaetano Vasari]] agreed to join the ''rosanero'' with a salary based on the number of appearances he would have made in the season. [[Silvio Baldini]] was appointed as new boss to replace [[Nedo Sonetti]]. Several football pundits suggested Palermo to be the real favourite team to win the Serie B league because of the quality of its roster.\n\nThe team made a very impressive start by defeating [[Gianfranco Zola]]'s [[Cagliari Calcio]], and managed to be always in the promotion spots. However, following a surprising 3-1 home defeat to [[Salernitana Calcio 1919|Salernitana]] that brought Palermo down to third place, Baldini heavily criticized club chairman [[Maurizio Zamparini]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116150927/http://www.raisport.rai.it/pub/sezione/raiSportSezioneIndex/0%2C5785%2C_205_60_1416%2C00.html|title= Zamparini Interview|language=Italian|publisher=raisport.it}}</ref> who consequently fired him and appointed [[Francesco Guidolin]] at his place. On the last day of the January transfer market, three new notable signings were made: [[Antonio Filippini]], [[Emanuele Filippini]] and [[Fabio Grosso]]. Palermo later returned to top the table and eventually won the league, ending with the same points than Cagliari, but being crowned as Serie B champions due to head-to-head matches.\n\n==Squad==\n{{fs
