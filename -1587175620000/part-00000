The outreach mission was further expanded by the [[Smith\u2013Lever Act of 1914]] to include [[Cooperative extension service|cooperative extension]]\u2014the sending of agents into rural areas to help bring the results of agricultural research to the end users. Beyond the original land grants, each land-grant college receives annual federal appropriations for research and extension work on the condition that those funds are matched by state funds.\n\n==Expansion==\nWhile today's land-grant universities were initially known as land-grant [[college]]s, only a few  of the [[List of land-grant universities|more than 70]] institutions that developed from the Morrill Acts retain \"College\" in their official names; most are universities.\n\nThe [[University of the District of Columbia]] received land-grant status in 1967 and a $7.24 million endowment ([[United States dollar|USD]]) in lieu of a land grant. In a 1972 Special Education Amendment, [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], [[Micronesia]], [[Northern Marianas]], and [[Virgin Islands|the Virgin Islands]] each received $3 million.\n\nIn 1994, 29 [[tribal colleges and universities]] became land-grant institutions under the [[Improving America's Schools Act of 1994]]. As of 2008, 32 tribal colleges and universities have land-grant status.  Most of these colleges grant two-year degrees. Six are four-year institutions, and two offer a master's degree.\n\n==Land Acknowledgement Statements==\nIn the early 21st century, a growing number of land-grant universities placed Land Acknowledgement statements on their websites in recognition of the fact that their institutions occupy lands that were once home to Native Americans.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nash |first1=Margaret A. |title=Entangled Pasts: Land-Grant Colleges and American Indian Dispossession. |journal=History of Education Quarterly |date=November 2019 |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=437\u2013467 |doi=10.1017/heq.2019.31|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Nash |first1=Margaret A. |title=The Dark History of Land-Grant Universities |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/11/08/dark-history-land-grant-universities/ |accessdate=December 3, 2019 |work=The Washington Post |date=November 8, 2019}}</ref>  For example, the University of Illinois System states, \" These lands were the traditional birthright of indigenous peoples who were forcibly removed and who have faced two centuries of struggle for survival and identity in the wake of dispossession.

The outreach mission was further expanded by the [[Smith\u2013Lever Act of 1914]] to include [[Cooperative extension service|cooperative extension]]\u2014the sending of agents into rural areas to help bring the results of agricultural research to the end users. Beyond the original land grants, each land-grant college receives annual federal appropriations for research and extension work on the condition that those funds are matched by state funds.\n\n==Expansion==\nWhile today's land-grant universities were initially known as land-grant [[college]]s, only a few  of the [[List of land-grant universities|more than 70]] institutions that developed from the Morrill Acts retain \"College\" in their official names; most are universities.\n\nThe [[University of the District of Columbia]] received land-grant status in 1967 and a $7.24 million endowment ([[United States dollar|USD]]) in lieu of a land grant. In a 1972 Special Education Amendment, [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], [[Micronesia]], [[Northern Marianas]], and [[Virgin Islands|the Virgin Islands]] each received $3 million.\n\nIn 1994, 29 [[tribal colleges and universities]] became land-grant institutions under the [[Improving America's Schools Act of 1994]]. As of 2008, 32 tribal colleges and universities have land-grant status.  Most of these colleges grant two-year degrees. Six are four-year institutions, and two offer a master's degree.\n\n==Land Acknowledgement Statements==\nIn the early 21st century, a growing number of land-grant universities placed Land Acknowledgement statements on their websites in recognition of the fact that their institutions occupy lands that were once home to Native Americans.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nash |first1=Margaret A. |title=Entangled Pasts: Land-Grant Colleges and American Indian Dispossession. |journal=History of Education Quarterly |date=November 2019 |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=437\u2013467 |doi=10.1017/heq.2019.31|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Nash |first1=Margaret A. |title=The Dark History of Land-Grant Universities |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/11/08/dark-history-land-grant-universities/ |accessdate=December 3, 2019 |work=The Washington Post |date=November 8, 2019}}</ref>  For example, the University of Illinois System states, \" These lands were the traditional birthright of indigenous peoples who were forcibly removed and who have faced two centuries of struggle for survival and identity in the wake of dispossession.

He was best known for his work on [[Race (human classification)|race]] and [[social class]] and for his call to abolish \"[[Whiteness studies|whiteness]]\". Ignatiev was the co-founder of the New [[Abolitionism (disambiguation)|Abolitionist]] Society and co-editor of the journal ''Race Traitor'', which promoted the idea that \"treason to whiteness is loyalty to humanity\".<ref name=HarvardMagazine/> He also wrote a book on [[Antebellum South|antebellum]] [[Northern United States|northern]] xenophobia against [[Immigration to the United States|Irish immigrants]], ''How the Irish Became White''.

Allen]] and [[Harry Haywood]]) to help form the [[Communist Labor Party of North America|Provisional Organizing Committee to Reconstitute the Marxist\u2013Leninist Communist Party]] (POC). He was expelled from the POC in 1966.<ref>{{cite web|author=Noel Ignatin |url=http://www.marxists.org/history/erol/1956-1960/ignatin01.htm |title=The POC: A Personal Memoir |publisher=Theoretical Review #12 |accessdate=July 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\nHe later became involved in the [[Students for a Democratic Society]]. When that organization fractured in the late 1960s, Ignatiev became part of the group [[Sojourner Truth Organization]] (STO) in 1970. Unlike other groups in the New Communist movement, the STO and Ignatiev were also heavily influenced by the ideas of Trinidadian writer [[C. L. R. James]].\n\nFor twenty years, Ignatiev worked in a [[Gary, Indiana]] [[steel mill]] and also in the manufacturing of farming equipment and electrical components. A [[Marxist]] activist, he was involved in efforts by African American steel workers to achieve equality in the mills. In 1984, he was [[layoff|laid off]] from the steel mill, approximately a year after an arrest on charges of attacking a strike-breaker's car with a paint bomb.<ref name=WashTimes/>\n\n== Academic career ==\nIgnatiev set up Marxist discussion groups in the early 1980s. In 1985, Ignatiev was accepted to the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]] without an undergraduate degree. After earning his master's degree, he joined the Harvard faculty as a lecturer and worked toward a doctorate in [[History of the United States|U.S. history]].\n\nIgnatiev was a graduate student at [[Harvard University]] where he earned his Ph.D. in 1995. He taught courses there before moving to the [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design|Massachusetts College of Art]]. His academic work was linked to his call to \"abolish\" the [[white race]], a controversial slogan whose meaning is not always agreed upon by those who debate his work. His dissertation, published by [[Routledge]] as the book ''How the Irish Became White'', was advised by prominent social historian of American race and ethnicity [[Stephan Thernstrom]]. Ignatiev was the co-founder and co-editor of the journal ''Race Traitor'' and the ''New Abolitionist Society''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://racetraitor.org/naindex.html|title=New Abolitionist Society|website=racetraitor.org|access-date=2018-04-10}}</ref>\n\n== Ideas and controversies ==\n=== Views of race ===\nIgnatiev viewed race distinctions and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] itself as a [[social construct]], not a scientific reality.<ref>Smedley, Audrey (2007-March-14-17). \"[http://www.understandingrace.org/resources/pdf/disease/smedley.pdf The History of the Idea of Race... and Why It Matters]\". presented at the conference \"Race, Human Variation and Disease: Consensus and Frontiers\" sponsored by the American Anthropological Association (AAA).\nSober, Elliott (2000).

Ignatiev asserted that the Irish were not initially accepted as white by the dominant English-American population. He claimed that only through their own violence against free blacks and support of slavery did the Irish gain acceptance as white. Ignatiev defined [[whiteness studies|whiteness]] as the access to [[white privilege]], which according to Ignatiev gains people perceived to have \"white\" skin admission to certain neighborhoods, schools, and jobs. In the 19th century, whiteness was strongly associated with political power, especially [[suffrage]]. Ignatiev's book on Irish immigrants has been criticized for \"conflat[ing] race and economic position\" and for ignoring data that contradicts his theses.<ref name=\"Arnesen2001\"/>\n\nIgnatiev stated that attempts to give race a biological foundation have only led to absurdities as in the common example that a white woman could give birth to a black child, but a black woman could never give birth to a white child.<ref name=Routledge/> Ignatiev asserted that the only logical explanation for this notion is that people are members of different racial categories because society assigns people to these categories.\n\n=== \"New abolition\" and the \"white race\" ===\nIgnatiev's web site and publication ''Race Traitor'' displayed the motto \"treason to whiteness is loyalty to humanity\". In response to a letter to the site which understood the motto as meaning that the authors \"hated\" white people because of their \"white skin\", Ignatiev and the other editors responded:\n{{quote|We do not hate you or anyone else for the color of her skin. What we hate is a system that confers privileges (and burdens) on people because of their color. It is not fair skin that makes people white; it is fair skin in a certain kind of society, one that attaches social importance to skin color. When we say we want to abolish the white race, we do not mean we want to exterminate people with fair skin. We mean that we want to do away with the social meaning of skin color, thereby abolishing the white race as a social category. Consider this parallel: To be against royalty does not mean wanting to kill the king. It means wanting to do away with crowns, thrones, titles, and the privileges attached to them. In our view, whiteness has a lot in common with royalty: they are both social formations that carry unearned advantages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://racetraitor.org/ |title=Racetraitor.org |publisher=Racetraitor.org |date= |accessdate=April 8, 2010}}</ref>}}\n\nIn September 2002, ''[[Harvard Magazine]]'' published an excerpt from ''When Race Becomes Real: Black and White Writers Confront Their Personal Histories'', edited by Bernestine Singley, about Ignatiev's role in launching ''Race Traitor''.<ref name=HarvardMagazine>{{cite web |url=http://www.harvardmagazine.com/2002/09/abolish-the-white-race.html |title=Abolish the White Race |date=September\u2013October 2002 |work=[[Harvard Magazine]] |department=The Browser |accessdate=March 7, 2016 }}</ref> In the excerpt, Ignatiev wrote that \"[t]he goal of abolishing the white race is on its face so desirable that some may find it hard to believe that it could incur any opposition other than from committed white supremacists\".<ref name=HarvardMagazine/> He wrote that the magazine's editors were frequently accused of being racists or part of a hate group, to which his \"standard response\" was \"to draw an analogy with anti-royalism: to oppose monarchy does not mean killing the king; it means getting rid of crowns, thrones, royal titles, etc.\"<ref name=HarvardMagazine/> Ignatiev also wrote that \"[t]he editors meant it when they replied to a reader, 'Make no mistake about it: we intend to keep bashing the dead white males, and the live ones, and the females too, until the social construct known as \"the white race\" is destroyed\u2014not \"deconstructed\" but destroyed'\".<ref name=HarvardMagazine/>\n\nSome conservative critics, particularly [[David Horowitz]], saw the excerpt as an example of [[institutional racism]] against white people at Harvard, in \"progressive culture\" and in [[academia]].<ref name=WashTimes/> On his website, Horowitz wrote: \"Suppose [[Frontpagemagazine.com]] ran a headline 'Abolish the Black Race'? What do you think the reaction would be? But at Harvard, where demonizing whites is merely the standard curriculum, an article like this can appear in a glossy magazine whose cover story is 'Whither the Art Museum?'\".<ref name=WashTimes/>\n\n=== Toaster controversy ===\nFrom 1986 until 1992, Ignatiev served as a tutor (academic adviser) for [[Dunster House]] at Harvard College. In early 1992, Ignatiev objected to the university's purchase of a toaster oven for the Dunster House dining hall that would be designated for [[Kosher foods|kosher]] use only. He insisted that cooking utensils with restricted use should be paid for by private funds. In a letter to the Harvard student newspaper, the ''[[Harvard Crimson]]'', Ignatiev wrote: \"I regard anti-Semitism, like all forms of religious, ethnic and racial bigotry, as a crime against humanity and whoever calls me an anti-Semite will face a libel suit\".<ref>{{cite web|author=No Writer Attributed |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=229365 |title=No Toaster Subsidy |publisher=Thecrimson.com |date=March 18, 1992 |accessdate=April 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\nDunster House subsequently declined to renew Ignatiev's contract, saying that his conduct during the dispute was \"unbecoming of a Harvard tutor\". Dunster co-master Hetty Liem said it was the job of a tutor \"to foster a sense of community and tolerance and to serve as a role model for the students\" and that Ignatiev had not done so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=222958 |title=Dunster Dismisses Vocal Tutor |publisher=Thecrimson.com |date=May 11, 1992 |accessdate=April 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Encyclopedia of Race and Racism'' ===\nIn 2008, the [[American Jewish Committee]] objected to an encyclopedia article on [[Zionism]] that Ignatiev wrote for ''The Encyclopedia of Race and Racism''.<ref name=AJC>[http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/110745.html AJC: Withdraw Zionism chapter in race book], December 10, 2008, Jewish Telegraphic Agency</ref> In the article, Ignatiev described [[Israel]] as a \"racial state, where rights are assigned on the basis of ascribed descent or the approval of the superior race\" and likened it to [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Southern United States]] before the [[civil rights movement]].<ref>\"Zionism\", Encyclopedia of Race and Racism, Macmillan Press, 2007, pp 240\u2013244.</ref>\n\nThe American Jewish Committee cited numerous \"factual and historical inaccuracies\" in Ignatiev's article.

He was best known for his work on [[Race (human classification)|race]] and [[social class]] and for his call to abolish \"[[Whiteness studies|whiteness]]\". Ignatiev was the co-founder of the New [[Abolitionism (disambiguation)|Abolitionist]] Society and co-editor of the journal ''Race Traitor'', which promoted the idea that \"treason to whiteness is loyalty to humanity\".<ref name=HarvardMagazine/> He also wrote a book on [[Antebellum South|antebellum]] [[Northern United States|northern]] xenophobia against [[Immigration to the United States|Irish immigrants]], ''How the Irish Became White''.

Allen]] and [[Harry Haywood]]) to help form the [[Communist Labor Party of North America|Provisional Organizing Committee to Reconstitute the Marxist\u2013Leninist Communist Party]] (POC). He was expelled from the POC in 1966.<ref>{{cite web|author=Noel Ignatin |url=http://www.marxists.org/history/erol/1956-1960/ignatin01.htm |title=The POC: A Personal Memoir |publisher=Theoretical Review #12 |accessdate=July 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\nHe later became involved in the [[Students for a Democratic Society]]. When that organization fractured in the late 1960s, Ignatiev became part of the group [[Sojourner Truth Organization]] (STO) in 1970. Unlike other groups in the New Communist movement, the STO and Ignatiev were also heavily influenced by the ideas of Trinidadian writer [[C. L. R. James]].\n\nFor twenty years, Ignatiev worked in a [[Gary, Indiana]] [[steel mill]] and also in the manufacturing of farming equipment and electrical components. A [[Marxist]] activist, he was involved in efforts by African American steel workers to achieve equality in the mills. In 1984, he was [[layoff|laid off]] from the steel mill, approximately a year after an arrest on charges of attacking a strike-breaker's car with a paint bomb.<ref name=WashTimes/>\n\n== Academic career ==\nIgnatiev set up Marxist discussion groups in the early 1980s. In 1985, Ignatiev was accepted to the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]] without an undergraduate degree. After earning his master's degree, he joined the Harvard faculty as a lecturer and worked toward a doctorate in [[History of the United States|U.S. history]].\n\nIgnatiev was a graduate student at [[Harvard University]] where he earned his Ph.D. in 1995. He taught courses there before moving to the [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design|Massachusetts College of Art]]. His academic work was linked to his call to \"abolish\" the [[white race]], a controversial slogan whose meaning is not always agreed upon by those who debate his work. His dissertation, published by [[Routledge]] as the book ''How the Irish Became White'', was advised by prominent social historian of American race and ethnicity [[Stephan Thernstrom]]. Ignatiev was the co-founder and co-editor of the journal ''Race Traitor'' and the ''New Abolitionist Society''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://racetraitor.org/naindex.html|title=New Abolitionist Society|website=racetraitor.org|access-date=2018-04-10}}</ref>\n\n== Ideas and controversies ==\n=== Views of race ===\nIgnatiev viewed race distinctions and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] itself as a [[social construct]], not a scientific reality.<ref>Smedley, Audrey (2007-March-14-17). \"[http://www.understandingrace.org/resources/pdf/disease/smedley.pdf The History of the Idea of Race... and Why It Matters]\". presented at the conference \"Race, Human Variation and Disease: Consensus and Frontiers\" sponsored by the American Anthropological Association (AAA).\nSober, Elliott (2000).

Ignatiev asserted that the Irish were not initially accepted as white by the dominant English-American population. He claimed that only through their own violence against free blacks and support of slavery did the Irish gain acceptance as white. Ignatiev defined [[whiteness studies|whiteness]] as the access to [[white privilege]], which according to Ignatiev gains people perceived to have \"white\" skin admission to certain neighborhoods, schools, and jobs. In the 19th century, whiteness was strongly associated with political power, especially [[suffrage]]. Ignatiev's book on Irish immigrants has been criticized for \"conflat[ing] race and economic position\" and for ignoring data that contradicts his theses.<ref name=\"Arnesen2001\"/>\n\nIgnatiev stated that attempts to give race a biological foundation have only led to absurdities as in the common example that a white woman could give birth to a black child, but a black woman could never give birth to a white child.<ref name=Routledge/> Ignatiev asserted that the only logical explanation for this notion is that people are members of different racial categories because society assigns people to these categories.\n\n=== \"New abolition\" and the \"white race\" ===\nIgnatiev's web site and publication ''Race Traitor'' displayed the motto \"treason to whiteness is loyalty to humanity\". In response to a letter to the site which understood the motto as meaning that the authors \"hated\" white people because of their \"white skin\", Ignatiev and the other editors responded:\n{{quote|We do not hate you or anyone else for the color of her skin. What we hate is a system that confers privileges (and burdens) on people because of their color. It is not fair skin that makes people white; it is fair skin in a certain kind of society, one that attaches social importance to skin color. When we say we want to abolish the white race, we do not mean we want to exterminate people with fair skin. We mean that we want to do away with the social meaning of skin color, thereby abolishing the white race as a social category. Consider this parallel: To be against royalty does not mean wanting to kill the king. It means wanting to do away with crowns, thrones, titles, and the privileges attached to them. In our view, whiteness has a lot in common with royalty: they are both social formations that carry unearned advantages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://racetraitor.org/ |title=Racetraitor.org |publisher=Racetraitor.org |date= |accessdate=April 8, 2010}}</ref>}}\n\nIn September 2002, ''[[Harvard Magazine]]'' published an excerpt from ''When Race Becomes Real: Black and White Writers Confront Their Personal Histories'', edited by Bernestine Singley, about Ignatiev's role in launching ''Race Traitor''.<ref name=HarvardMagazine>{{cite web |url=http://www.harvardmagazine.com/2002/09/abolish-the-white-race.html |title=Abolish the White Race |date=September\u2013October 2002 |work=[[Harvard Magazine]] |department=The Browser |accessdate=March 7, 2016 }}</ref> In the excerpt, Ignatiev wrote that \"[t]he goal of abolishing the white race is on its face so desirable that some may find it hard to believe that it could incur any opposition other than from committed white supremacists\".<ref name=HarvardMagazine/> He wrote that the magazine's editors were frequently accused of being racists or part of a hate group, to which his \"standard response\" was \"to draw an analogy with anti-royalism: to oppose monarchy does not mean killing the king; it means getting rid of crowns, thrones, royal titles, etc.\"<ref name=HarvardMagazine/> Ignatiev also wrote that \"[t]he editors meant it when they replied to a reader, 'Make no mistake about it: we intend to keep bashing the dead white males, and the live ones, and the females too, until the social construct known as \"the white race\" is destroyed\u2014not \"deconstructed\" but destroyed'\".<ref name=HarvardMagazine/>\n\nSome conservative critics, particularly [[David Horowitz]], saw the excerpt as an example of [[institutional racism]] against white people at Harvard, in \"progressive culture\" and in [[academia]].<ref name=WashTimes/> On his website, Horowitz wrote: \"Suppose [[Frontpagemagazine.com]] ran a headline 'Abolish the Black Race'? What do you think the reaction would be? But at Harvard, where demonizing whites is merely the standard curriculum, an article like this can appear in a glossy magazine whose cover story is 'Whither the Art Museum?'\".<ref name=WashTimes/>\n\n=== Toaster controversy ===\nFrom 1986 until 1992, Ignatiev served as a tutor (academic adviser) for [[Dunster House]] at Harvard College. In early 1992, Ignatiev objected to the university's purchase of a toaster oven for the Dunster House dining hall that would be designated for [[Kosher foods|kosher]] use only. He insisted that cooking utensils with restricted use should be paid for by private funds. In a letter to the Harvard student newspaper, the ''[[Harvard Crimson]]'', Ignatiev wrote: \"I regard anti-Semitism, like all forms of religious, ethnic and racial bigotry, as a crime against humanity and whoever calls me an anti-Semite will face a libel suit\".<ref>{{cite web|author=No Writer Attributed |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=229365 |title=No Toaster Subsidy |publisher=Thecrimson.com |date=March 18, 1992 |accessdate=April 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\nDunster House subsequently declined to renew Ignatiev's contract, saying that his conduct during the dispute was \"unbecoming of a Harvard tutor\". Dunster co-master Hetty Liem said it was the job of a tutor \"to foster a sense of community and tolerance and to serve as a role model for the students\" and that Ignatiev had not done so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=222958 |title=Dunster Dismisses Vocal Tutor |publisher=Thecrimson.com |date=May 11, 1992 |accessdate=April 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Encyclopedia of Race and Racism'' ===\nIn 2008, the [[American Jewish Committee]] objected to an encyclopedia article on [[Zionism]] that Ignatiev wrote for ''The Encyclopedia of Race and Racism''.<ref name=AJC>[http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/110745.html AJC: Withdraw Zionism chapter in race book], December 10, 2008, Jewish Telegraphic Agency</ref> In the article, Ignatiev described [[Israel]] as a \"racial state, where rights are assigned on the basis of ascribed descent or the approval of the superior race\" and likened it to [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Southern United States]] before the [[civil rights movement]].<ref>\"Zionism\", Encyclopedia of Race and Racism, Macmillan Press, 2007, pp 240\u2013244.</ref>\n\nThe American Jewish Committee cited numerous \"factual and historical inaccuracies\" in Ignatiev's article. The American Jewish Committee also questioned why the encyclopedia included an entry about Zionism, stating that it was the only nationalist movement with an article in the encyclopedia.<ref name=AJC/> Gideon Shimoni, Professor Emeritus at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, criticized the article as a \"litany of errors and distortions of fact\".<ref>Gideon Shimoni, [http://www.spme.net/cgi-bin/articles.cgi?ID=4739 A Comment on the Entry \"Zionism\" in the Encyclopedia of Race and Racism], December 1, 2008.</ref>\n\nSubsequently, the encyclopedia's publisher Gale announced the appointment of an independent committee to investigate \"the factual accuracy, scholarly basis, coverage, scope, and balance of every article\".
