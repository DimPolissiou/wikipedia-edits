The camp is a host to many bizarre occurrences, such as camp counselors who are popular girl witches, horses that transform into unicorns, talking sharks, yetis, haunted cabins, post-it notes that lead to other dimensions, and nosey monsters that live under the bed. Oscar and Hedgehog must contend with these out-of-place events and make their stay at camp worthwhile.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/01/summer-camp-island-series-cartoon-network-julia-pott-sundance-short-1201896930/|title=\u2018Summer Camp Island\u2019 Series Gets Greenlight From Cartoon Network|first=Denise|last=Petski|website=Deadline|date=January 30, 2017|accessdate=March 5, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-X6SEDtQ1M|title=Summer Camp Island|author=Black player|website=[[YouTube]]|date=January 31, 2017|accessdate=March 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n*Oscar Peltzer (voiced by Justin Felbinger in the pilot and Elliott Smith (episodes 1-38); Asher Bishop (episode 39-present) in the series), an 11 year old anthropomorphic [[elephant]] who is best friends with Hedgehog. Oscar tends to be socially awkward and slightly uncomfortable with his new surroundings. However, when he sets his mind to something, he will become determined to perform any task or complete any objective. He has a strong connection to Hedgehog to the point that if she disappeared or something happened to her, he becomes inconsolable, though he does learn to work without her. He believes in order and will do anything to outsmart or outdo Susie, the main antagonist. He lives in [[New Jersey]].\n*Hedgehog (voiced by [[Ashley Boettcher]] in the pilot and [[Oona Laurence]] in the series) an 11 year old anthropomorphic [[hedgehog]] who is best friends with Oscar. She is the more level-headed and logical of the two. She mostly wants to help Oscar out of his comfort zone, but also wants to outdo Susie. Due to the events of \"Hedgehog Werewolf\", Hedgehog transforms into a [[werewolf]] at the full moon. She has a crush on Max. She lives in [[New Jersey]]. After the events of \"Spell Crushers\", she finally gets her magic wand from Betsy after she passed her Witch Final Exams, but at the episode \"The Library\", it got confiscated by Susie after she sees her using magic spells with it. Hedgehog enjoys playing music, radio show hosting, science and spells throughout episodes.\n*Susie McCallister (voiced by Julia Pott), an anthropomorphic [[cat]], a witch and lead camp counselor. She can be mean and condescending to the campers at times. Deep down, she does display some responsible and sympathetic behavior, but would rather be rude to the campers. Despite looking and acting as a fifteen-year-old, the episode \"Fuzzy Pink Time Babies\" indicates that she is at least around 150 years old. She loves to tease and torment Oscar and Hedgehog whenever she gets the chance to do it, especially Oscar.\n*Alice Fefferman (voiced by [[Charlyne Yi]]), an anthropomorphic [[elephant]], a witch and one of the camp's counselors and the most powerful of the three. She serves as Susie's [[Personal Assistant|right-hand woman]] but generally is not as mean to the campers as Susie is. She is very commanding however, and would rather turn everything around her cute just to please her.\n*Betsy Spellman (voiced by Nikki Castillo), an anthropomorphic [[horse]], a witch and one of the camp's counselors. She appears to be the kindest and most down-to-earth of the witches and seems to clash with Susie at times. It is revealed in \"Hedgehog Werewolf\" that she herself is a werewolf, something she keeps secret from everyone except Hedgehog. She also teaches Hedgehog the ways of magic in secret especially from Susie.\n*Max (voiced by Thomas Vaethroeder in the pilot, and Ramone Hamilton in the series), an anthropomorphic [[bat]]. He is a fun-loving, wily, and also helpful kid who likes to enjoy the company of Oscar and Hedgehog. However, in the pilot he shows a more aggressive attitude towards Oscar, seeing him as somewhat of a nuisance. Everyone appears to think he is cool because of his backwards cap.\n\n===Supporting===\n*Pajamas (voiced by Anna Strupinsky [Pilot] and Naomi Hansen [Series]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bakersfield.com/entertainment/tv-voice-role-really-the-elephant-s-pajamas-for-young/article_956272f6-7e1d-11e8-acdd-3feb23196027.html|title=TV voice role really the elephant's pajamas for young local actor|first=KELLY ARDIS|last=kardis@bakersfield.com|publisher=}}</ref>), a pair of sentient pajamas owned by Oscar.\n*Pepper Corn (voiced by [[Sam Lavagnino]]), an anthropomorphic [[Giant panda|panda]] normally seen with his security blanket.

The camp is a host to many bizarre occurrences, such as camp counselors who are popular girl witches, horses that transform into unicorns, talking sharks, yetis, haunted cabins, post-it notes that lead to other dimensions, and nosey monsters that live under the bed. Oscar and Hedgehog must contend with these out-of-place events and make their stay at camp worthwhile.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/01/summer-camp-island-series-cartoon-network-julia-pott-sundance-short-1201896930/|title=\u2018Summer Camp Island\u2019 Series Gets Greenlight From Cartoon Network|first=Denise|last=Petski|website=Deadline|date=January 30, 2017|accessdate=March 5, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-X6SEDtQ1M|title=Summer Camp Island|author=Black player|website=[[YouTube]]|date=January 31, 2017|accessdate=March 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n*Oscar Peltzer (voiced by Justin Felbinger in the pilot and Elliott Smith (episodes 1-38); Asher Bishop (episode 39-present) in the series), an 11 year old anthropomorphic [[elephant]] who is best friends with Hedgehog. Oscar tends to be socially awkward and slightly uncomfortable with his new surroundings. However, when he sets his mind to something, he will become determined to perform any task or complete any objective. He has a strong connection to Hedgehog to the point that if she disappeared or something happened to her, he becomes inconsolable, though he does learn to work without her. He believes in order and will do anything to outsmart or outdo Susie, the main antagonist. He lives in [[New Jersey]].\n*Hedgehog (voiced by [[Ashley Boettcher]] in the pilot and [[Oona Laurence]] in the series) an 11 year old anthropomorphic [[hedgehog]] who is best friends with Oscar. She is the more level-headed and logical of the two. She mostly wants to help Oscar out of his comfort zone, but also wants to outdo Susie. Due to the events of \"Hedgehog Werewolf\", Hedgehog transforms into a [[werewolf]] at the full moon. She has a crush on Max. She lives in [[New Jersey]]. After the events of \"Spell Crushers\", she finally gets her magic wand from Betsy after she passed her Witch Final Exams, but at the episode \"The Library\", it got confiscated by Susie after she sees her using magic spells with it. Hedgehog enjoys playing music, radio show hosting, science and spells throughout episodes.\n*Susie McCallister (voiced by Julia Pott), an anthropomorphic [[cat]], a witch and lead camp counselor. She can be mean and condescending to the campers at times. Deep down, she does display some responsible and sympathetic behavior, but would rather be rude to the campers. Despite looking and acting as a fifteen-year-old, the episode \"Fuzzy Pink Time Babies\" indicates that she is at least around 150 years old. She loves to tease and torment Oscar and Hedgehog whenever she gets the chance to do it, especially Oscar.\n*Alice Fefferman (voiced by [[Charlyne Yi]]), an anthropomorphic [[elephant]], a witch and one of the camp's counselors and the most powerful of the three. She serves as Susie's [[Personal Assistant|right-hand woman]] but generally is not as mean to the campers as Susie is. She is very commanding however, and would rather turn everything around her cute just to please her.\n*Betsy Spellman (voiced by Nikki Castillo), an anthropomorphic [[horse]], a witch and one of the camp's counselors. She appears to be the kindest and most down-to-earth of the witches and seems to clash with Susie at times. It is revealed in \"Hedgehog Werewolf\" that she herself is a werewolf, something she keeps secret from everyone except Hedgehog. She also teaches Hedgehog the ways of magic in secret especially from Susie.\n*Max (voiced by Thomas Vaethroeder in the pilot, and Ramone Hamilton in the series), an anthropomorphic [[bat]]. He is a fun-loving, wily, and also helpful kid who likes to enjoy the company of Oscar and Hedgehog. However, in the pilot he shows a more aggressive attitude towards Oscar, seeing him as somewhat of a nuisance. Everyone appears to think he is cool because of his backwards cap.\n\n===Supporting===\n*Pajamas (voiced by Anna Strupinsky [Pilot] and Naomi Hansen [Series]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bakersfield.com/entertainment/tv-voice-role-really-the-elephant-s-pajamas-for-young/article_956272f6-7e1d-11e8-acdd-3feb23196027.html|title=TV voice role really the elephant's pajamas for young local actor|first=KELLY ARDIS|last=kardis@bakersfield.com|publisher=}}</ref>), a pair of sentient pajamas owned by Oscar.\n*Pepper Corn (voiced by [[Sam Lavagnino]]), an anthropomorphic [[Giant panda|panda]] normally seen with his security blanket.

Article Begins Here -->\nThe '''German Wirehaired Pointer''' is a medium to large-sized  [[Griffon (dog type)|griffon]] type [[dog breed|breed]] of [[dog]] developed in the 19th century in [[Germany]] for hunting.  It became a leading gun dog in Germany in the later part of the 20th century. It is the result of the careful mixing and crossing of the [[Wirehaired Pointing Griffon]], [[German Shorthaired Pointer]], [[Stichelhaar|German Roughhaired Pointer]], and the hunting [[Pudelpointer]] in the late 19th century.\n\n== Description ==\n\n===Appearance===\nThe German Wirehaired pointer is a well muscled, medium to large-sized dog of distinctive appearance. Balanced in size and sturdily built, the breed's most distinguishing characteristics are its weather resistant, wire-like coat and its facial furnishings. Typically pointer in character and style, the German wirehaired pointer is an intelligent, energetic and determined hunter. The tail is typically [[Docking (animals)|docked]] to two-fifths of the natural length. In countries where docking is prohibited the tail should be of sufficient length to reach down to the [[hock (zoology)|hocks]]. Like all German pointers, they have webbed feet. This dog is sometimes confused with the [[Italiano Spinone|Spinone Italiano]].\n\n====Coat====\nThe functional wiry coat is the breed's most distinctive feature. A dog must have a correct coat to be of correct type. The coat is weather resistant and water-repellent. The undercoat is dense enough in winter to insulate against the cold but is so thin in summer as to be almost invisible. The distinctive outer coat is straight, harsh, wiry and flat lying, and is from one to two inches in length. The outer coat is long enough to protect against the punishment of rough cover, but not so long as to hide the outline of the dog. On the lower legs the coat is shorter and between the toes it is of softer texture. On the skull the coat is naturally short and close fitting. Over the shoulders and around the tail it is very dense and heavy. The tail is nicely coated, particularly on the underside, but devoid of feather. Eyebrows are of strong, straight hair. Beard and whiskers are medium length. The hairs in the liver patches of a liver and white dog may be shorter than the white hairs. A short smooth coat, a soft woolly coat, or an excessively long coat is to be severely penalized when showing. While maintaining a harsh, wiry texture, the puppy coat may be shorter than that of an adult coat. The coat of the puppy should be shorter than 1&nbsp;inch the adult coat should be kept at 1&nbsp;inch long.\n\n====Gait====\nThe dog should be evaluated at a moderate gait. The movement is free and smooth with good reach in the forequarters and good driving power in the hindquarters. The topline should remain firm.\n\n===Temperament===\nThe German Wirehaired pointer is affectionate, lively, very determined, active and intelligent. Eager to learn and loyal to its family, it needs a handler who is consistent in approach. They like to be occupied, are vigorous and enjoy working for their owners. They are friendly with those they know, but are sometimes aloof with strangers and should be socialized at an early age. They often don't do well in a kennel environment.  German Wirehaired pointers are happiest and most well behaved when they are part of the family and can spend time with their people. They can be rather willful.  Some dogs have a tendency to roam.  Powerful and energetic, they can become bored and hard to manage without enough exercise. The German Wirehaired pointer is a good all-around gun dog, able to hunt any sort of game on any sort of terrain. This dog has a good nose and can track, point, and retrieve on both land and water. Loyal and playful, the German Wirehaired Pointer thrives on human companionship. However, they are still dogs, and all dogs may bite small children without adequate management and supervision. Although they are generally accepting of other dogs, they tend to focus upon the people in their family.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/german_wirehaired_pointer/index.cfm|title= German Wirehaired Pointer AKC|publisher=www.akc.org|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===Color===\n[[Image:AKC German Wirehaired Pointer Dog Show 2013.jpg|right|thumb|German Wirehaired Pointer head]]\nThe Colors are: Liver (brown) and white or black and white ticked usually with some solid patches, and solid liver (brown) with or without a white chest patch.<ref name=\"American Kennel Club\">{{cite web|title=German Wirehaired Pointer Breed Standard|url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/german_wirehaired_pointer/index.cfm|accessdate=2012-10-15|year=2007 |publisher=American Kennel Club}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n==Health==\n\nVery few health risks.\n\n==History==\n{{Refimprove section|date=April 2019}}\n\nGerman Wirehaired pointers trace their origins back to 1880.
