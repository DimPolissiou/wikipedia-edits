A [[Chain smoking|chain smoker]], he was likened to TV police detective Lieutenant [[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]. He was the father of the referee [[Guy Goethals]], who officiated at the [[UEFA Euro 96|1996 European Championships]].\n\n==Playing career and early coaching career==\nGoethals began his career as a goalkeeper in the 1930s with [[R. Daring Club Molenbeek|Daring Brussels]], making his way through the youth ranks of the club before joining Racing Club Brussel in 1947. He remained at Racing Club Brussel until 1948. After a period spent playing for Renaisi\u00e8nne, he moved into coaching with Hannutois and Waremme, and led [[K. Sint-Truidense V.V.|Sint-Truiden]] to second place in the [[Belgian First Division]] in 1966.\n\n===Belgium national coach===\nGoethals took charge of the [[Belgium national football team|Belgian national side]] in 1968. Belgium would succeed in qualifying for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]] in [[Mexico]], although they were eliminated in the first round of the tournament. Belgium hosted the [[1972 UEFA European Football Championship|1972 European Championship]], having knocked out holders [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the qualifying stages, and defeated [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] in the match for third place after losing in the semi-final to eventual tournament winners [[Germany national football team|Germany]]. That marked Goethals' greatest success as national team coach. He also took great pride in the fact that Belgium had held the emergent [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national team]] scoreless in both their meetings in [[1974 FIFA World Cup qualification|1974 World Cup qualifying]]. Belgium completed their qualifying campaign without having conceded a single goal, but lost out to the Netherlands on account of their inferior goal difference.\n\n===Return to club coaching===\nIn 1976 Goethals' tenure as coach of the national side ended, and he joined [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] as coach. In his first season, Anderlecht reached the final of the [[1977 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|European Cup Winners' Cup]], where they lost to German side [[Hamburger SV]], but won the trophy the following year with a comprehensive victory over [[FK Austria Wien|FK Austria/WAC]]. After spells coaching in France at [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] and in Brazil with [[S\u00e3o Paulo Futebol Clube|S\u00e3o Paulo]], Goethals returned to Belgium to coach [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]]. Standard Li\u00e8ge were Belgian champions in 1982 and 1983, and they reached the [[1982 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|Cup Winners' Cup Final]] in 1982, losing to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], who were at a considerable advantage in that the final was played at their home ground, [[Camp Nou]].\n\n===Controversy and Goethals' return to Anderlecht===\nStandard Li\u00e8ge's 1982 championship win was to become the subject of great controversy in 1984. Seemingly preoccupied with winning his first Belgian title, Goethals had suggested and initiated the bribing of the Waterschei players prior to the teams' meeting in the final match of the season, in order to secure championship honours for Standard Li\u00e8ge and ensure that none of his players would miss their European final against Barcelona through injury. Goethals was forced to resign in the wake of the scandal, and he moved to Portugal to take charge of [[Vit\u00f3ria S.C.|Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es]]. He then returned to Belgium to coach [[R. Jet Wavre|Racing Jet de Bruxelles]] before a second spell in charge of Anderlecht, where he won [[Belgian Cup]] trophy in 1989. [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] again recruited Goethals, and they finished runners-up in the [[Ligue 1|French championship]] in [[1989\u201390 French Division 1|1989\u201390]] behind [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]]. Approaching 70 years of age, Goethals' greatest triumph as a coach was yet to come.\n\n===Olympique de Marseille===\nIn 1990, Goethals was named coach of [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] and was entrusted with the task of leading the club to [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] success. In his first season, the club narrowly missed out on European glory, losing on penalties in the [[1991 European Cup Final|European Cup Final]] to [[Red Star Belgrade]]. There was recognition for Goethals' coaching abilities, as he was voted 1991 European Coach of the Year. In 1993, Marseille again reached the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] [[1993 UEFA Champions League Final|final]], where they defeated favourites [[A.C. Milan]] with a headed goal by [[Basile Boli]]. Having achieved his primary objective at Marseille, Goethals left the club.\n\nMarseille were later stripped of their [[1992\u201393 French Division 1|1993]] French championship when it emerged that three [[Valenciennes FC|Valenciennes]] players had been offered money to underperform in a crucial match against Marseille. The club were not allowed to defend their European title as a result, and were punished with relegation to the French [[Ligue 2|second division]].\n\n==Retirement==\nGoethals' coaching career ended at Anderlecht in season 1995\u201396, but he remained in demand as a television analyst for his insights into football. He died of bowel cancer aged 83. In 2005, the year following his death, he was voted 38th in [[De Grootste Belg]], a Flemish television programme based on the [[BBC]]'s [[100 Greatest Britons]]. The number 2 stand at [[F. C. Molenbeek Brussels Strombeek|F.C. Brussels]]' home ground, [[Edmond Machtens Stadium]], was renamed in honour of Goethals in late 2005. He remains today as the oldest winning manager of [[UEFA Champions League]].\n\n==Honours==\n===Manager===\n'''Anderlecht''' \n*[[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]]: [[1977\u201378 European Cup Winners' Cup|1977\u201378]]\n*[[UEFA Super Cup|European Super Cup]]: [[1976 European Super Cup|1976]], [[1978 European Super Cup|1978]]\n*[[Belgian Cup]]: 1988\u201389\n\n'''Standard Li\u00e8ge'''\n*[[Belgian Pro League|Belgian First Division]]: [[1981\u201382 Belgian First Division|1981\u201382]], [[1982\u201383 Belgian First Division|1982\u201383]]\n*[[Belgian Super Cup]]: 1981, 1983\n\n''Marseille'''' \n*[[Ligue 1|French Division 1]]: [[1990\u201391 French Division 1|1990\u201391]], [[1991\u201392 French Division 1|1991\u201392]]\n*[[UEFA Champions League]]: [[1992\u201393 UEFA Champions League|1992\u201393]]\n\n'''Belgium'''\n*[[UEFA Euro 1972]]: Third place\n\n===Individual===\n*[[Albo Panchina d'Oro|Panchina d'Oro]]: 1990\u201391<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alleniamo.com/comunicati/2010/febbraio/panchina_oro_allegri.htm|title=Albo \"Panchina d'Oro\"|publisher=Alleniamo.com|language=Italian|accessdate=25 April 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707113036/http://www.alleniamo.com/comunicati/2010/febbraio/panchina_oro_allegri.htm|archivedate=7 July 2011}}</ref>\n*[[France Football]] 47th Greatest Manager of All Time: 2019<ref name=\"FOXSports\">{{cite web |url=https://www.foxsports.com.mx/news/400382-los--mejores-entrenadores-de-la-historia|title=Los 50 mejores entrenadores de la historia|publisher=[[FOX Sports]] |date=19 March 2019 |accessdate=29 December 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"ABCes\">{{cite web |url=https://www.abc.es/deportes/futbol/abci-50-mejores-entrenadores-historia-futbol-201903191710_noticia.html|title=Los 50 mejores entrenadores de la historia del f\u00fatbol|publisher=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]] |date=19 March 2019 |accessdate=29 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100613010330/http://raymondgoethals.be/ Raymond Goethals on www.belgium.be in Dutch/French and English]\n* [http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=265278.html Raymond Goethals' obituary on UEFA.com]\n* [http://www.uefa.com/uefa/aboutuefa/organisation/history/obituaries/newsid=265401.html The magician remembered' by Berend Scholten on UEFA.com]\n\n{{Navboxes colour\n|title = Belgium squads\n|bg = #d4071a\n|fg = #ffce4a\n|bordercolor = Black\n|list1 =\n{{Belgium squad 1970 FIFA World Cup}}\n{{Belgium squad UEFA Euro 1972}}\n}}\n{{Navboxes colour\n|title=Awards\n|bg=gold\n|fg=navy\n|list1=\n{{European Cup / Champions League winning managers}}\n{{UEFA Cup Winners' Cup winning managers}}\n{{Ligue 1 winning managers}}\n}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title= Managerial positions\n|list1=\n{{K.

He has been active in the avant garde theatre in India in Marathi and Hindi theatre as an actor, director and producer since 1967. His contribution to the modern Indian theatre is often overshadowed by his popularity as a lead actor in Hindi films.\n\nAs a film actor, he was most prominent in the 1970s. His image as a \"boy next door\" contrasted with the larger-than-life heroes prevalent at that time in Indian cinema. He received one [[Filmfare award]] and six State awards as Best Actor. His performances in regional language films in Marathi, Bengali, Malayalam and Kannada fetched him critical acclaim as well. He decided not to act after 1986 in order to concentrate on filmmaking.\n\nAs a director, he is known for the sensitive portrayal of women, selection of classic stories from Indian literature, and perceptive handling of progressive issues. He has directed several television serials on the national network such as ''Kachchi Dhoop'', ''Mrignayani'', ''Naquab'', ''Paool Khuna'' and ''Krishna Kali''.\n\n===Theatre journey===\nPalekar began in [[Marathi language|Marathi]] experimental theatre with [[Satyadev Dubey]], and later started his own group, ''Aniket'', in 1972.\n\n===Movie career===\nPalekar made his debut in 1971 with the [[Marathi language|Marathi]] film ''[[Shantata!

This led to many other such roles in \"middle-class\" comedies, mostly alternative. These were mostly directed by Chatterjee or [[Hrishikesh Mukherjee]] and included films such as ''[[Gol Maal]]'' and ''[[Naram Garam]]''. He won the Filmfare Best Actor Award for ''Gol Maal''.\n\nHe is noted for his image of the \"middle-class everyman\" who struggles to get a job (''[[Gol Maal]]''), his own flat (''[[Gharonda]]''), a girlfriend/wife (''[[Baaton Baaton Mein]]''), and appreciation from his boss.\n\nIn 1979, he was paired with a sixteen-year-old [[Sridevi]] in [[Solva Saawan]], which was her debut Hindi movie as a heroine. Amol played the role of an intellectually disabled man, a character played by [[Kamal Haasan]] in the original Tamil movie.\n\nIn 1982 he played the role of Ravi in the [[Malayalam]] movie ''[[Olangal]]''. He turned to directing with the [[Marathi language|Marathi]] film ''Aakriet''.

He has been active in the avant garde theatre in India in Marathi and Hindi theatre as an actor, director and producer since 1967. His contribution to the modern Indian theatre is often overshadowed by his popularity as a lead actor in Hindi films.\n\nAs a film actor, he was most prominent in the 1970s. His image as a \"boy next door\" contrasted with the larger-than-life heroes prevalent at that time in Indian cinema. He received one [[Filmfare award]] and six State awards as Best Actor. His performances in regional language films in Marathi, Bengali, Malayalam and Kannada fetched him critical acclaim as well. He decided not to act after 1986 in order to concentrate on filmmaking.\n\nAs a director, he is known for the sensitive portrayal of women, selection of classic stories from Indian literature, and perceptive handling of progressive issues. He has directed several television serials on the national network such as ''Kachchi Dhoop'', ''Mrignayani'', ''Naquab'', ''Paool Khuna'' and ''Krishna Kali''.\n\n===Theatre journey===\nPalekar began in [[Marathi language|Marathi]] experimental theatre with [[Satyadev Dubey]], and later started his own group, ''Aniket'', in 1972.\n\n===Movie career===\nPalekar made his debut in 1971 with the [[Marathi language|Marathi]] film ''[[Shantata! Court Chalu Aahe]]'' directed by [[Satyadev Dubey]], which started the New Cinema Movement in Marathi.<ref>{{cite news|title=Amol Palekar's debut|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/marathi/movies/did-you-know/Amol-Palekars-debut-/articleshow/13698397.cms|accessdate=27 June 2016|work=The Times of India|date=4 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171220140351/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/marathi/movies/did-you-know/Amol-Palekars-debut-/articleshow/13698397.cms|archive-date=20 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\nIn 1974 he was cast as an actor by [[Basu Chatterjee]] in ''[[Rajnigandha]]'', and in the surprise low-budget hit, ''[[Chhoti Si Baat]]''. This led to many other such roles in \"middle-class\" comedies, mostly alternative. These were mostly directed by Chatterjee or [[Hrishikesh Mukherjee]] and included films such as ''[[Gol Maal]]'' and ''[[Naram Garam]]''. He won the Filmfare Best Actor Award for ''Gol Maal''.\n\nHe is noted for his image of the \"middle-class everyman\" who struggles to get a job (''[[Gol Maal]]''), his own flat (''[[Gharonda]]''), a girlfriend/wife (''[[Baaton Baaton Mein]]''), and appreciation from his boss.\n\nIn 1979, he was paired with a sixteen-year-old [[Sridevi]] in [[Solva Saawan]], which was her debut Hindi movie as a heroine. Amol played the role of an intellectually disabled man, a character played by [[Kamal Haasan]] in the original Tamil movie.\n\nIn 1982 he played the role of Ravi in the [[Malayalam]] movie ''[[Olangal]]''. He turned to directing with the [[Marathi language|Marathi]] film ''Aakriet''. He showed his capabilities as a [[film director|director]] with movies such as [[Thodasa Roomani Ho Jaayen]] and [[Paheli]].

The line occupied a point where the routes into Tunisia from the south converged, leading toward Mareth, with the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the east and a sand sea on the other.\n\nThe line ran north of Wadi Zigzaou for about {{cvt|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} south-westwards from the [[Gulf of Gab\u00e8s]] to Cheguimi and the Djebel (mountain) Matmata on the Dahar plateau between the [[Grand Erg Oriental|Great Eastern Sand Sea]] and the [[Matmata, Tunisia|Matmata]] hills. The [[Tebaga Gap]], between the Mareth line and the Great Eastern Sand Sea, a potential route by which an invader could outflank the Mareth line, was not given consideration until 1938.\n\nTunisia was occupied by [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces after [[Operation Torch]] in 1942 and the line was used by the Axis to defend against the British and Allied [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]], which had conquered Libya early in 1943.\n\n==Background==\n\n===French strategy===\nIn 1930s the defence of the [[French colonial empire]] (French Indochina, Pacific Islands, West Indies, African colonies and Syria\u2013Lebanon) was left to the [[French Foreign Legion]], colonial and \"native\" units, the {{lang|fr|[[Marine nationale]]}} (Navy) and the {{lang|fr|[[Arm\u00e9e de l'Air]]}} (Air Force). By the late 1930s, the Navy had only one aircraft carrier and the {{lang|fr|Arm\u00e9e de l'Air}} could spare only second-rate aircraft. [[French Algeria|Algeria]], [[French Protectorate in Morocco|Morocco]] and Tunisia provided much of the manpower of the {{lang|fr|[[Troupes coloniales|Arm\u00e9e coloniale]]}} and Tunisia, with the Italian colony of [[Italian Libya|Libya]] to the east, was excepted from the priority given to the defence of metropolitan France.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaufmann|1a2=Kaufmann|1y=2006|1p=89|2a1=Jackson|2y=2000|2pp=332\u2013333}}\n\nFrench plans for defence of Tunisia assumed that Italy would launch an overwhelming assault that France could not easily oppose. Italy was expected to launch attacks on [[Egypt]] and Tunisia as soon as war was declared, with the Italian Navy securing supply and blocking any substantial Anglo-French relief. With a force of six divisions, a fortress division and a cavalry division to defend Tunisia, the French army considered the construction of a \"[[Maginot Line]] in the desert\" ({{lang|fr|ligne Maginot du d\u00e9sert}}).{{sfn|Playfair|1954|p=92}}\n\n===Geography===\n\nThe geography of central Tunisia is dominated by the [[Atlas Mountains]], while the northern and southern portions are largely flat. The primary feature in the south is the Matmata Hills, a range running north-south roughly parallel to the Mediterranean coast. West of the hills, the land is the inhospitable [[Jebel Dahar]] then the Dehar region of desert to the west, making the region between the hills and the coast the only easily traversed approach to northern Tunisia.{{sfn|Ford|2012|p=46}} A smaller line of hills runs east\u2013west along the northern edge of the Matmata range, further complicating this approach. At the far northern end of the Matmata Hills is the [[Tebaga Gap]].\n\n===Plans===\n\n[[File:Tunisia Topography.png|thumb|upright=.75|{{center|Topographic map of Tunisia}}]]\nIn January 1934 planning began on the new fortifications; Infantry officers selected the sites for strongpoints to dominate the ground in front with overlapping fields of fire. In 1936, the French government provided funds for construction after Italy formed the [[Axis powers|Rome\u2013Berlin Axis]] with Germany, creating a greater threat to French security in North Africa.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}{{efn|The cost of the Mareth Line and its forward defences was similar to that of {{lang|fr|ouvrage of St Agnes}} in the Alps.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}}} The casemates designed for the line had much less concrete than comparable examples in France and had no {{lang|fr|[[wkt:fosse|foss\u00e9]]}} (gap) rather a stable door, in case the lower part was blocked by d\u00e9bris. In September 1936, during a meeting with General [[Alphonse Joseph Georges|Joseph Georges]], it was agreed that the fortification of the Mareth Line, Bizerte, Medenine, Ben Gardane and Foum Tathouine must be completed.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}\n\nMedenine, Ben Gardane to the west and Foum Tathouine to the east, were south of the proposed line, Foum Tathouine being the place where the routes to Mareth passed through a bottleneck between the Matmata Mountains and the sea. The line was divided into eastern and western sectors with a main line of resistance and a reserve line about about {{cvt|1.5|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} back. A {{lang|fr|secteur d\u00e9fensif}} (SD) was to be built on the rocky Dahar Plateau, which later became part of an SD across the Matmata Hills to [[Kebili]] on the edge of the [[Chott el Djerid]]. The chott and and Chott El Fedjaj drained across Tunisia into Wadi Akarit, across Tunisia but Wadi Akarit was only sketchily fortified, the French concentrating on the Mareth Line {{cvt|50|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} south, to cover Gabes.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}} The gap between the Mareth Line and the Great Eastern Sand Sea, a potential route by which an invader could outflank the Mareth line, was not given consideration until 1938.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=89}}\n\n==The Mareth Line==\n\n[[File:Mareth Line Panel.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Mareth Line Panel}}]]\nThe Mareth Line consisted of casemates surrounded by barbed wire and built for for all-round defence in the main and reserve lines, the obstacles being doubled on the fronts and sides. The strongpoints in the main line included flanking machine-gun casemates and anti-tank gun positions; in the reserve line artillery emplacements provided covering fire in the gaps between the strongpoints in the main line. Some of the flanking casemates for machine-guns covering the gaps were connected by galleries; strongpoints on the plain and in hills had anti-tank positions. An anti-tank obstacle of vertical rails was built along the front of the line and the sides of Wadi Zigzaou were steepened. Eight artillery casemates, forty infantry casemates or blockhouses and fifteen command posts were built. The eastern sector had twelve strongpoints in the main line and eleven in the reserve line. The western sector had eleven strongpoints in the main line and seven in the reserve line.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}\n\nIn the Matmata hills, Ksar el Hallouf covered an anti-tank ditch which continued the position beyond the main line which ended on the foothills. An infantry position was dug into the Matmata hills at Ksar-el-Hallouf and in the Dahar beyond, a strongpoint at Bir Soltane had two 75 mm turrets, removed from [[Char 2C]] tanks built in 1918. At Ben Gardane an advanced position was built consisting of a square redoubt inside an anti-tank ditch with casemates on the flanks and concrete infantry shelters. Small triangular strongpoints at the corners were surrounded by anti-tank rail obstacles that continued around the position. After the outbreak of the war a line of {{lang|fr|avant-postes}} advanced positions was built on the high ground of Aram {{cvt|10|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} south of the main line.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}\n\n==Second World War==\n\nThe [[Second World War]] began in 1939 but the Mareth Line saw no use from 1939\u20131940, as Italy remained neutral until a few days before the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940]], after which, the line was demilitarised by an Italo-German commission. In November 1942, the British [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] ([[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Bernard Montgomery]]) defeated {{lang|de|[[Panzer Army Africa|Panzerarmee Afrika]]}} at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] and the British [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] landed in French North Africa in [[Operation Torch]]. Axis forces occupied Tunisia in the [[Tunisia Campaign]] and from November 1942 to March 1943, the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}} conducted a fighting retreat through Egypt and Libya, pursued by the Eighth Army. Axis engineers refurbished the Mareth Line for occupation by the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}} and by March 1943, more than {{convert|100|km|mi|order=flip}} of [[barbed wire]], 100,000 anti-tank mines and 70,000 anti-personnel mines had been laid, bunkers had been reinforced with concrete and armed with anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns.  In March 1943, the Eighth Army reached the Libya\u2013Tunisia border and paused at Medenine to prepare to attack the Mareth Line. Axis forces were renamed the [[First Army (Italy)|Italian 1st Army]] (General [[Giovanni Messe]]) and attempted a spoiling attack, {{lang|de|[[Operation Capri|Unternehmen Capri]]}} (Operation Capri). The attack failed and the Axis troops withdrew to the Mareth Line, to await the British attack.{{efn|The Mareth Line was garrisoned by the [[136th Infantry Division Giovani Fascisti|136th Infantry Division \"Giovani Fascisti\"]], [[101st Motorised Division Trieste|101st Motorised Division \"Trieste\"]], [[90th Light Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|90th Light Division]], [[80th Infantry Division La Spezia (Airlanding)|80th Infantry Division \"La Spezia\"]], [[16th Motorised Division Pistoia|16th Motorised Division \"Pistoia\"]], [[164th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|164th Light ''Afrika'' Division]] and the [[15th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|15th Panzer Division]] with 32 operational tanks. In reserve were the [[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|21st Panzer Division]] and the [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] with 110 operational tanks. The line from Djebel Tebaga\u2013Djebel Melab was held by the {{lang|it|Raggruppamento Sahariano}}.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=333}}}} The British survey of the Mareth Line was assisted by General Rime-Bruneau, a former Chief of Staff of the Tunisian garrison and Captain Paul Mezan, the Garrison Engineer of the Mareth Line.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=332}}\n\n===Battle of the Mareth Line===\n{{Main article|Battle of the Mareth Line}}\n\n[[File:Mareth line object.jpg|thumb|{{center|Infantry bunker of the Mareth Line}}]]\nOn 19 March 1943, the Eighth Army, made a frontal assault against the Mareth Line in Operation Pugilist. The [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division|50th Northumbrian Infantry Division]] penetrated the Line near [[Zarat, Tunisia|Zarat]] but was driven back by the [[33rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|15th Panzer Division]] and the{{lang|it|Giovani Fascisti}} on 22 March.<ref>[https://adviceandresearch.blogspot.com/2019/06/division-giovani-fascisti-in-1943.html Giovani Fascisti division at Mareth]</ref> Earlier reconnaissance by the [[Long Range Desert Group]] had shown that the Line could be outflanked. A force could pass through the southern Matmata Hills, reach the Tebaga Gap from the west and pass on to the coastal plain behind the Mareth Line. At the same time as Pugilist, Montgomery had sent the [[2nd New Zealand Division]] around the Matmata Hills but its attack was contained at the Tebaga Gap from 21 to 24 March.

The line occupied a point where the routes into Tunisia from the south converged, leading toward Mareth, with the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the east and a sand sea on the other. The line ran north of Wadi Zigzaou for about {{cvt|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} south-westwards from the [[Gulf of Gab\u00e8s]] to Cheguimi and the Djebel (mountain) Matmata on the Dahar plateau between the [[Grand Erg Oriental|Great Eastern Sand Sea]] and the [[Matmata, Tunisia|Matmata]] hills. The [[Tebaga Gap]], between the Mareth line and the Great Eastern Sand Sea, a potential route by which an invader could outflank the Mareth line, was not given consideration until 1938.\n\nTunisia was occupied by [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces after [[Operation Torch]] in 1942 and the line was used by the Axis to defend against the British and Allied [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]], which had conquered Libya early in 1943.\n\n==Background==\n\n===French strategy===\nIn 1930s the defence of the [[French colonial empire]] (French Indochina, Pacific Islands, West Indies, African colonies and Syria\u2013Lebanon) was left to the [[French Foreign Legion]], colonial and \"native\" units, the {{lang|fr|[[Marine nationale]]}} (Navy) and the {{lang|fr|[[Arm\u00e9e de l'Air]]}} (Air Force). By the late 1930s, the Navy had only one aircraft carrier and the {{lang|fr|Arm\u00e9e de l'Air}} could spare only second-rate aircraft. [[French Algeria|Algeria]], [[French Protectorate in Morocco|Morocco]] and Tunisia provided much of the manpower of the {{lang|fr|[[Troupes coloniales|Arm\u00e9e coloniale]]}} and Tunisia, with the Italian colony of [[Italian Libya|Libya]] to the east, was excepted from the priority given to the defence of metropolitan France.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaufmann|1a2=Kaufmann|1y=2006|1p=89|2a1=Jackson|2y=2000|2pp=332\u2013333}}\n\nFrench plans for defence of Tunisia assumed that Italy would launch an overwhelming assault that France could not easily oppose. Italy was expected to launch attacks on [[Egypt]] and Tunisia as soon as war was declared, with the Italian Navy securing supply and blocking any substantial Anglo-French relief. With a force of six divisions, a fortress division and a cavalry division to defend Tunisia, the French army considered the construction of a \"[[Maginot Line]] in the desert\" ({{lang|fr|ligne Maginot du d\u00e9sert}}).{{sfn|Playfair|1954|p=92}}\n\n===Geography===\n\nThe geography of central Tunisia is dominated by the [[Atlas Mountains]], while the northern and southern portions are largely flat. The primary feature in the south is the Matmata Hills, a range running north-south roughly parallel to the Mediterranean coast. West of the hills, the land is the inhospitable [[Jebel Dahar]] then the Dehar region of desert to the west, making the region between the hills and the coast the only easily traversed approach to northern Tunisia.{{sfn|Ford|2012|p=46}} A smaller line of hills runs east\u2013west along the northern edge of the Matmata range, further complicating this approach. At the far northern end of the Matmata Hills is the [[Tebaga Gap]].\n\n===Plans===\n\n[[File:Tunisia Topography.png|thumb|upright=.75|{{center|Topographic map of Tunisia}}]]\nIn January 1934 planning began on the new fortifications; Infantry officers selected the sites for strongpoints to dominate the ground in front with overlapping fields of fire. In 1936, the French government provided funds for construction after Italy formed the [[Axis powers|Rome\u2013Berlin Axis]] with Germany, creating a greater threat to French security in North Africa.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}{{efn|The cost of the Mareth Line and its forward defences was similar to that of {{lang|fr|ouvrage of St Agnes}} in the Alps.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}}} The casemates designed for the line had much less concrete than comparable examples in France and had no {{lang|fr|[[wkt:fosse|foss\u00e9]]}} (gap) rather a stable door, in case the lower part was blocked by d\u00e9bris. In September 1936, during a meeting with General [[Alphonse Joseph Georges|Joseph Georges]], it was agreed that the fortification of the Mareth Line, Bizerte, Medenine, Ben Gardane and Foum Tathouine must be completed.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}\n\nMedenine, Ben Gardane to the west and Foum Tathouine to the east, were south of the proposed line, Foum Tathouine being the place where the routes to Mareth passed through a bottleneck between the Matmata Mountains and the sea. The line was divided into eastern and western sectors with a main line of resistance and a reserve line about about {{cvt|1.5|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} back. A {{lang|fr|secteur d\u00e9fensif}} (SD) was to be built on the rocky Dahar Plateau, which later became part of an SD across the Matmata Hills to [[Kebili]] on the edge of the [[Chott el Djerid]]. The chott and and Chott El Fedjaj drained across Tunisia into Wadi Akarit, across Tunisia but Wadi Akarit was only sketchily fortified, the French concentrating on the Mareth Line {{cvt|50|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} south, to cover Gabes.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}} The gap between the Mareth Line and the Great Eastern Sand Sea, a potential route by which an invader could outflank the Mareth line, was not given consideration until 1938.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=89}}\n\n==The Mareth Line==\n\n[[File:Mareth Line Panel.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Mareth Line Panel}}]]\nThe Mareth Line consisted of casemates surrounded by barbed wire and built for for all-round defence in the main and reserve lines, the obstacles being doubled on the fronts and sides. The strongpoints in the main line included flanking machine-gun casemates and anti-tank gun positions; in the reserve line artillery emplacements provided covering fire in the gaps between the strongpoints in the main line. Some of the flanking casemates for machine-guns covering the gaps were connected by galleries; strongpoints on the plain and in hills had anti-tank positions. An anti-tank obstacle of vertical rails was built along the front of the line and the sides of Wadi Zigzaou were steepened. Eight artillery casemates, forty infantry casemates or blockhouses and fifteen command posts were built. The eastern sector had twelve strongpoints in the main line and eleven in the reserve line. The western sector had eleven strongpoints in the main line and seven in the reserve line.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}\n\nIn the Matmata hills, Ksar el Hallouf covered an anti-tank ditch which continued the position beyond the main line which ended on the foothills. An infantry position was dug into the Matmata hills at Ksar-el-Hallouf and in the Dahar beyond, a strongpoint at Bir Soltane had two 75 mm turrets, removed from [[Char 2C]] tanks built in 1918. At Ben Gardane an advanced position was built consisting of a square redoubt inside an anti-tank ditch with casemates on the flanks and concrete infantry shelters. Small triangular strongpoints at the corners were surrounded by anti-tank rail obstacles that continued around the position. After the outbreak of the war a line of {{lang|fr|avant-postes}} advanced positions was built on the high ground of Aram {{cvt|10|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} south of the main line.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}\n\n==Second World War==\n\nThe [[Second World War]] began in 1939 but the Mareth Line saw no use from 1939\u20131940, as Italy remained neutral until a few days before the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940]], after which, the line was demilitarised by an Italo-German commission. In November 1942, the British [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] ([[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Bernard Montgomery]]) defeated {{lang|de|[[Panzer Army Africa|Panzerarmee Afrika]]}} at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] and the British [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] landed in French North Africa in [[Operation Torch]]. Axis forces occupied Tunisia in the [[Tunisia Campaign]] and from November 1942 to March 1943, the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}} conducted a fighting retreat through Egypt and Libya, pursued by the Eighth Army. Axis engineers refurbished the Mareth Line for occupation by the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}} and by March 1943, more than {{convert|100|km|mi|order=flip}} of [[barbed wire]], 100,000 anti-tank mines and 70,000 anti-personnel mines had been laid, bunkers had been reinforced with concrete and armed with anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns.  In March 1943, the Eighth Army reached the Libya\u2013Tunisia border and paused at Medenine to prepare to attack the Mareth Line. Axis forces were renamed the [[First Army (Italy)|Italian 1st Army]] (General [[Giovanni Messe]]) and attempted a spoiling attack, {{lang|de|[[Operation Capri|Unternehmen Capri]]}} (Operation Capri). The attack failed and the Axis troops withdrew to the Mareth Line, to await the British attack.{{efn|The Mareth Line was garrisoned by the [[136th Infantry Division Giovani Fascisti|136th Infantry Division \"Giovani Fascisti\"]], [[101st Motorised Division Trieste|101st Motorised Division \"Trieste\"]], [[90th Light Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|90th Light Division]], [[80th Infantry Division La Spezia (Airlanding)|80th Infantry Division \"La Spezia\"]], [[16th Motorised Division Pistoia|16th Motorised Division \"Pistoia\"]], [[164th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|164th Light ''Afrika'' Division]] and the [[15th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|15th Panzer Division]] with 32 operational tanks. In reserve were the [[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|21st Panzer Division]] and the [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] with 110 operational tanks. The line from Djebel Tebaga\u2013Djebel Melab was held by the {{lang|it|Raggruppamento Sahariano}}.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=333}}}} The British survey of the Mareth Line was assisted by General Rime-Bruneau, a former Chief of Staff of the Tunisian garrison and Captain Paul Mezan, the Garrison Engineer of the Mareth Line.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=332}}\n\n===Battle of the Mareth Line===\n{{Main article|Battle of the Mareth Line}}\n\n[[File:Mareth line object.jpg|thumb|{{center|Infantry bunker of the Mareth Line}}]]\nOn 19 March 1943, the Eighth Army, made a frontal assault against the Mareth Line in Operation Pugilist. The [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division|50th Northumbrian Infantry Division]] penetrated the Line near [[Zarat, Tunisia|Zarat]] but was driven back by the [[33rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|15th Panzer Division]] and the{{lang|it|Giovani Fascisti}} on 22 March.<ref>[https://adviceandresearch.blogspot.com/2019/06/division-giovani-fascisti-in-1943.html Giovani Fascisti division at Mareth]</ref> Earlier reconnaissance by the [[Long Range Desert Group]] had shown that the Line could be outflanked. A force could pass through the southern Matmata Hills, reach the Tebaga Gap from the west and pass on to the coastal plain behind the Mareth Line. At the same time as Pugilist, Montgomery had sent the [[2nd New Zealand Division]] around the Matmata Hills but its attack was contained at the Tebaga Gap from 21 to 24 March. Montgomery sent the [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|1st Armoured Division]] ([[X Corps (United Kingdom)|X Corps]]) to reinforce the attack at the Tebaga Gap. The British attacked again in [[Battle of the Mareth Line#Operation Supercharge II|Operation Supercharge II]] on 26 March and broke through the gap the next day.
