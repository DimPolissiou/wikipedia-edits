{"title_page": "Kabarett", "text_new": "{{unbalanced|date=December 2015}}\n'''Kabarett''' ({{IPA-de|kaba\u02c8\u0281\u025bt}}; from French ''cabaret'' = [[tavern]]) is satirical [[revue]], a form of [[cabaret]] which developed in [[France]] by [[Rodolphe Salis]] in 1881 as the ''cabaret artistique''. It was named [[Le Chat Noir]] and was centered on political events and satire. It later inspired creation of Kabarett venues in [[Germany]] from 1901, with the creation of [[Berlin]]'s [[\u00dcberbrettl]] venue and in [[Austria]] with the creation of the [[Jung-Wiener Theater zum lieben Augustin]] housed in the [[Theater an der Wien]]. By the [[Weimar era]] in the mid-1920s it was characterized by [[political satire]] and [[gallows humor]].<ref name=\"Britannica97V2p702\"/><ref name=\"Schonfeld06p192\"/> It shared the characteristic atmosphere of intimacy with the [[Cabaret#French cabaret (from 1881)|French cabaret]] from which it was imported, but the gallows humor was a distinct German aspect.<ref name=\"Britannica97V2p702\"/>\n\n==Difference from other forms==\nKabarett is the [[German language|German]] word for the French word ''[[cabaret]]''  but has two different meanings. The first meaning is the same as in English, describing a form of entertainment featuring comedy, song, dance, and theatre (often the word \"cabaret\" is used in German for this as well to distinguish this form). The latter describes a kind of [[political satire]]. Unlike [[comedian]]s who make fun of all kind of things, Kabarett artists ({{lang-de|Kabarettisten}}) pride themselves as dedicated almost completely to political and social topics of more serious nature which they criticize using techniques like [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]], [[sarcasm]] and [[irony]].<ref name=\"Britannica97V2p702\">(1997) [https://books.google.com/books?id=eecaAQAAMAAJ ''The new encyclopaedia Britannica''], Volume 2, p.702 quote: {{quotation|It retained the intimate atmosphere, entertainment platform, and improvisational character of the French cabaret but developed its own characteristic gallows humour.

This was lifted at the end of the [[First World War]], allowing the kabarett artists to deal with social themes and political developments of the time. This meant that German kabarett really began to blossom in the 1920s and 1930s, bringing forth all kinds of new cabaret artists, such as [[Werner Finck]] at the ''Katakombe'', [[Karl Valentin]] (died 1948) at the ''Wien-M\u00fcnchen'', [[Fritz Gr\u00fcnbaum]] and [[Karl Farkas]] at the Kabarett ''Simpl'' in Vienna, and [[Claire Waldoff]]. Some of their texts were written by great literary figures such as [[Kurt Tucholsky]], [[Erich K\u00e4stner]], and [[Klaus Mann]].\n\nWhen the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi party]] came to power in 1933, they started to repress this intellectual criticism of the times. Kabarett in Germany was hit badly. ([[Kander and Ebb]]'s Broadway musical, ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'', based on the [[Christopher Isherwood]] novel, [[Goodbye to Berlin]], deals with this period.) In 1935 [[Werner Finck]] was briefly imprisoned and sent to a [[concentration camp]]; at the end of that year Kurt Tucholsky committed suicide; and nearly all German-speaking kabarett artists fled into exile in [[Switzerland]], [[France]], [[Scandinavia]], or the [[United States of America|United States]].\n\nWhen the war ended, the occupying powers ensured that the kabarett portrayed the horrors of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime.

At the end of the decade, the students' movement of May 1968 split opinion on the genre as some old kabarett artists were booed off the stage for being part of the old establishment. In the 1970s, new forms of kabarett developed, such as the television show ''[[Notizen aus der Provinz]]''. At the end of the 1980s, kabarett was an important part of social criticism, with a minor boom at the time of [[Reunification of Germany|German reunification]]. In eastern Germany, kabarett artists had been growing more and more daring in their criticism of politicians in the time leading up to 1989. After reunification, new social problems, such as mass unemployment, the privatization of companies, and rapid changes in society, meant that cabarets rose in number. [[Dresden]], for example, gained two new cabarets alongside the popular ''Herkuleskeule''.\n\nIn the 1990s and at the start of the new millennium, the television and film comedy boom and a lessening of public interest in politics meant that television kabarett audiences in Germany dropped.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} In order to increase interest again the [[Walk of Fame of Cabaret]] in Mainz is honoring selected cabaret celebrities; many past cabaret celebrities are honored by stars and each year a star for a living one is added.\n\nAs of 1999, contemporary active political kabarettists and satirists in Germany include: [[Urban Priol]], [[Thomas Reis (Kabarettist)|Thomas Reis]], [[Arnulf Rating]], [[Heinrich Pachl]], [[3 Gestirn K\u00f6ln 1]], [[Bruno Jonas]], [[Richard Rogler]], [[Mathias Richling]], [[Dieter Hildebrandt]] (died 2013), [[Henning Venske]], [[Matthias Beltz]] (died 2002), [[Matthias Deutschmann]] and [[Volker Pispers]].<ref name=\"Pispers1999p9\">Pisper, Volker (1999) ''Damit m\u00fcssen Sie rechnen'', Teil 1, pp. 9-10, in ''Gef\u00fchlte Wirklichkeiten'' (2001)</ref>\n\n==Other notable Kabarett artists==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n*[[Willy Astor]]\n*[[J\u00fcrgen Becker]]\n*[[Konrad Beikircher]]\n*[[Martin Betz]]\n*[[Gerhard Bronner]]\n*[[Karl Dall]]\n*[[Alfred Dorfer]]\n*[[Gerd Dudenh\u00f6ffer]]\n*[[Max Ehrlich]], died 1944\n*[[Karl Farkas]]\n*[[Ottfried Fischer]]\n*[[Lisa Fitz]]\n*[[Egon Friedell]], died 1938\n*[[Andreas Giebel]]\n*[[Rainald Grebe]]\n*[[Christoph Grissemann]]\n*[[Fritz Gr\u00fcnbaum]], died 1941\n*[[G\u00fcnter Gr\u00fcnwald]]\n*[[Josef Hader]]\n*[[Dieter Hallervorden]]\n*[[Peter Hammerschlag]], died 1942\n*[[Eckart von Hirschhausen]]\n*[[Franz Hohler]]\n*[[J\u00f6rg Hube]], died 2009\n*[[Hanns Dieter H\u00fcsch]], died 2005\n*[[Georg Kreisler]], died 2011\n*[[Reiner Kr\u00f6hnert]]\n*[[Maren Kroymann]]\n*[[Frank L\u00fcdecke]]\n*[[Uwe Lyko]]\n*[[Rolf Miller]]\n*[[Wolfgang Neuss]], died 1989\n*[[Michael Niavarani]]\n*[[Dieter Nuhr]]\n*[[G\u00fcnther Paal]]\n*[[Rainer Pause]]\n*[[Erwin Pelzig]]\n*[[Sissi Perlinger]]\n*[[Gerhard Polt]]\n*[[Andreas Rebers]]\n*[[Lukas Resetarits]]\n*[[Hagen Rether]]\n*[[Helmut Schleich]]\n*[[Wilfried Schmickler]]\n*[[Werner Schneyder]]\n*[[Georg Schramm]]\n*[[Horst Schroth]]\n*[[Serdar Somuncu]]\n*[[Emil Steinberger (actor)|Emil Steinberger]]\n*[[Dirk Stermann]]\n*[[Ludger Stratmann]]\n*[[Mathias Tretter]]\n*[[Max Uthoff]]\n*[[Claus von Wagner]]\n*[[Bodo Wartke]]\n*[[Sigi Zimmerschied]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notable Kabarett shows and venues==\n*''[[Scheibenwischer]]''\n*''[[Neues aus der Anstalt]]''\n*''[[Notizen aus der Provinz]]''\n*''Tol(l)leranten'' ([[Mainz]])\n*''[[Kom(m)\u00f6dchen]]'' ([[D\u00fcsseldorf]])\n*''M\u00fcnchner Lach- und Schie\u00dfgesellschaft'' ([[Munich]])\n*''Herkuleskeule'' ([[Dresden]])\n*''[[Mitternachtsspitzen]]'' ([[Cologne]])\n*''[[Cabaret Ulenspiegel]]'' ([[Berlin]])\n*''[[Pantheon-Theater]]'' ([[Bonn]])\n\n==See also==\n*[[Walk of Fame of Cabaret]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Ambesser, Gwendolyn von: ''Schaubudenzauber - Geschichte und Geschichten eines legend\u00e4ren Kabaretts'', Verlag Edition AV, Lich/Hessen 2006, {{ISBN|3-936049-68-8}}\n* Arnbom, Marie-Theres, Wacks, Georg: ''J\u00fcdisches Kabarett in Wien. 1889 - 2009'', Armin Berg Verlag, Wien 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-9502673-0-3}}\n* Budzinski, Klaus: ''Pfeffer ins Getriebe \u2013 So ist und wurde das Kabarett'', Universitas Vlg., M\u00fcnchen 1982, {{ISBN|3-8004-1008-7}}\n* Budzinski, Klaus/Hippen, Reinhard: ''Metzler Kabarett Lexikon'', Vlg.

The latter describes a kind of [[political satire]]. Unlike [[comedian]]s who make fun of all kind of things, Kabarett artists ({{lang-de|Kabarettisten}}) pride themselves as dedicated almost completely to political and social topics of more serious nature which they criticize using techniques like [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]], [[sarcasm]] and [[irony]].<ref name=\"Britannica97V2p702\">(1997) [https://books.google.com/books?id=eecaAQAAMAAJ ''The new encyclopaedia Britannica''], Volume 2, p.702 quote: {{quotation|It retained the intimate atmosphere, entertainment platform, and improvisational character of the French cabaret but developed its own characteristic gallows humour.

The album features a wide range of samples and instrumentation, with many aspects of [[alternative hip hop]] that would come to dominate the hip hop music scene in the mid-late 1990s. ''The Score'''s production was handled mostly by the Fugees themselves, [[Jerry Duplessis]] and Warren Riker, with additional production from [[Salaam Remi]], [[John Fort\u00e9]], [[Diamond D]], Warren Riker and Shawn King. The album's guest raps are from [[Outsidaz]] members [[Rah Digga]], [[Young Zee]] and Pacewon, as well as Omega, John Fort\u00e9, and Diamond D. Most versions of the album feature four bonus tracks, including three remixes of \"Fu-Gee-La\", and a short acoustic Wyclef Jean solo track entitled \"Mista Mista\".\n\nUpon its release, ''The Score'' was a commercial success, peaking at the number one spot on both the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and the [[Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums]] chart (it was a number-one album on the latter in 1996 on the year-end chart). The singles \"[[Killing Me Softly with His Song#The Fugees version|Killing Me Softly]]\", \"[[Fu-Gee-La]]\", and \"[[Ready or Not (Fugees song)|Ready or Not]]\" also achieved notable chart success, and helped the group achieve worldwide recognition. On October 3, 1997, ''The Score'' was certified six times platinum in sales by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). In addition to receiving mostly favorable reviews upon its release, the album has garnered a considerable amount of acclaim over the years, with many music critics and publications noting it as one of the greatest albums of the 1990s, as well as one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time. In 1998, the album was included in ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'''s 100 best rap albums list, and in 2012, it was ranked number 469 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of [[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]].<ref name=\"500-greatest\">{{cite magazine| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-156826/the-fugees-the-score-43106/| date=May 31, 2012| title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time Rolling Stone\u2019s definitive list of the 500 greatest albums of all time| magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]| accessdate= September 2, 2019}}</ref> The album won the [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album]] at the [[39th Annual Grammy Awards]].\n\n== Background ==\nAlthough the Fugees' previous album ''[[Blunted on Reality]]'' proved to be critically and commercially unsuccessful, Chris Schwartz, head of Ruffhouse Records, decided to give the group another chance. In early 1995, he gave them a $135,000 advance and granted them complete artistic control for a follow-up album.<ref name=\"Technique\">{{cite book|first=Brian|last=Coleman|title=[[Check the Technique]]|publisher=[[Random House]]|location=New York City|date=2007|ISBN=978-0812977752|pages=[https://archive.org/details/checktechniqueli00cole/page/213 213\u2013215]}}</ref> The group used the money for recording equipment and set up a studio in Wyclef's uncle's basement, which they referred to as Booga Basement.<ref name=\"Technique\" />\n\nRecording for the album began in June 1995, and extended into November<ref name=\"Furman86\">Furman; Leah, Elina. 1999. P.86</ref> at what Jean described as a \"relaxed pace... It was done calmly, almost unconsciously. There wasn't any pressure - it was like 'let's make some music,' and it just started forming into something amazing. It sounded like a feel-good hip hop record to us, and it was different than what anyone was doing at the time. It was three kids from an urban background expressing themselves.\"<ref name=\"Technique\" />\n\nIn regard to ''The Score'''s unified themes and production, Hill commented \"It's an audio film. It's like how radio was back in the 1940s. It tells a story, and there are cuts and breaks in the music. It's almost like a hip hop version of ''[[Tommy (The Who album)|Tommy]]'', like what [[The Who]] did for rock music.\"<ref>Furman; Leah, Elina. 1999. P.78</ref>\n\n== Music ==\n''The Score'' was produced by a variety of producers including each member of the Fugees as well as [[Diamond D]], [[Salaam Remi]] and [[Jerry Duplessis]]. Although most tracks are built on [[sampling (music)|sampled]] [[melodies]], live instrumentation and [[Disc jockey|DJing]] are incorporated into multiple tracks. Wyclef Jean plays the guitar on \"Family Business\", while DJ Scribble [[Scratching|scratches]] on \"Manifest/Outro\". Nevertheless, samples are the predominant production tool on ''The Score''. \"Fu-Gee-La\" incorporates a sample of [[Teena Marie]]'s \"Ooh La La La\", and is [[Interpolation (music)|interpolated]] in the song's chorus. \"[[Ready or Not (Fugees song)|Ready or Not]]\" also contains a sample that is interpolated; \"Ready or Not (Here I Come)\" by [[The Delfonics]]. \"Manifest/Outro\" contains a sample from \"Rock Dis Funky Joint\" by [[Poor Righteous Teachers]], while the title track contains vocal samples from every track on the entire album.\n\nThree official singles were released in promotion of ''The Score'', the first of which was \"Fu-Gee-La\". The single was released January 9, 1996 and peaked at number 29 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], number 13 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]], and number 2 on the [[Hot Rap Songs]] chart.<ref name=\"Singles\">[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r231543/charts-awards/billboard-single|pure_url=yes}} ''The Score'' Singles Billboard Peak Positions].

worldwide February 13, 1996 on [[Columbia Records]]. The album features a wide range of samples and instrumentation, with many aspects of [[alternative hip hop]] that would come to dominate the hip hop music scene in the mid-late 1990s. ''The Score'''s production was handled mostly by the Fugees themselves, [[Jerry Duplessis]] and Warren Riker, with additional production from [[Salaam Remi]], [[John Fort\u00e9]], [[Diamond D]], Warren Riker and Shawn King. The album's guest raps are from [[Outsidaz]] members [[Rah Digga]], [[Young Zee]] and Pacewon, as well as Omega, John Fort\u00e9, and Diamond D. Most versions of the album feature four bonus tracks, including three remixes of \"Fu-Gee-La\", and a short acoustic Wyclef Jean solo track entitled \"Mista Mista\".\n\nUpon its release, ''The Score'' was a commercial success, peaking at the number one spot on both the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and the [[Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums]] chart (it was a number-one album on the latter in 1996 on the year-end chart). The singles \"[[Killing Me Softly with His Song#The Fugees version|Killing Me Softly]]\", \"[[Fu-Gee-La]]\", and \"[[Ready or Not (Fugees song)|Ready or Not]]\" also achieved notable chart success, and helped the group achieve worldwide recognition. On October 3, 1997, ''The Score'' was certified six times platinum in sales by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). In addition to receiving mostly favorable reviews upon its release, the album has garnered a considerable amount of acclaim over the years, with many music critics and publications noting it as one of the greatest albums of the 1990s, as well as one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time. In 1998, the album was included in ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'''s 100 best rap albums list, and in 2012, it was ranked number 469 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of [[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]].<ref name=\"500-greatest\">{{cite magazine| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-156826/the-fugees-the-score-43106/| date=May 31, 2012| title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time Rolling Stone\u2019s definitive list of the 500 greatest albums of all time| magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]| accessdate= September 2, 2019}}</ref> The album won the [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album]] at the [[39th Annual Grammy Awards]].\n\n== Background ==\nAlthough the Fugees' previous album ''[[Blunted on Reality]]'' proved to be critically and commercially unsuccessful, Chris Schwartz, head of Ruffhouse Records, decided to give the group another chance. In early 1995, he gave them a $135,000 advance and granted them complete artistic control for a follow-up album.<ref name=\"Technique\">{{cite book|first=Brian|last=Coleman|title=[[Check the Technique]]|publisher=[[Random House]]|location=New York City|date=2007|ISBN=978-0812977752|pages=[https://archive.org/details/checktechniqueli00cole/page/213 213\u2013215]}}</ref> The group used the money for recording equipment and set up a studio in Wyclef's uncle's basement, which they referred to as Booga Basement.<ref name=\"Technique\" />\n\nRecording for the album began in June 1995, and extended into November<ref name=\"Furman86\">Furman; Leah, Elina. 1999. P.86</ref> at what Jean described as a \"relaxed pace... It was done calmly, almost unconsciously. There wasn't any pressure - it was like 'let's make some music,' and it just started forming into something amazing. It sounded like a feel-good hip hop record to us, and it was different than what anyone was doing at the time. It was three kids from an urban background expressing themselves.\"<ref name=\"Technique\" />\n\nIn regard to ''The Score'''s unified themes and production, Hill commented \"It's an audio film. It's like how radio was back in the 1940s. It tells a story, and there are cuts and breaks in the music. It's almost like a hip hop version of ''[[Tommy (The Who album)|Tommy]]'', like what [[The Who]] did for rock music.\"<ref>Furman; Leah, Elina. 1999. P.78</ref>\n\n== Music ==\n''The Score'' was produced by a variety of producers including each member of the Fugees as well as [[Diamond D]], [[Salaam Remi]] and [[Jerry Duplessis]]. Although most tracks are built on [[sampling (music)|sampled]] [[melodies]], live instrumentation and [[Disc jockey|DJing]] are incorporated into multiple tracks. Wyclef Jean plays the guitar on \"Family Business\", while DJ Scribble [[Scratching|scratches]] on \"Manifest/Outro\". Nevertheless, samples are the predominant production tool on ''The Score''. \"Fu-Gee-La\" incorporates a sample of [[Teena Marie]]'s \"Ooh La La La\", and is [[Interpolation (music)|interpolated]] in the song's chorus. \"[[Ready or Not (Fugees song)|Ready or Not]]\" also contains a sample that is interpolated; \"Ready or Not (Here I Come)\" by [[The Delfonics]]. \"Manifest/Outro\" contains a sample from \"Rock Dis Funky Joint\" by [[Poor Righteous Teachers]], while the title track contains vocal samples from every track on the entire album.\n\nThree official singles were released in promotion of ''The Score'', the first of which was \"Fu-Gee-La\". The single was released January 9, 1996 and peaked at number 29 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], number 13 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]], and number 2 on the [[Hot Rap Songs]] chart.<ref name=\"Singles\">[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r231543/charts-awards/billboard-single|pure_url=yes}} ''The Score'' Singles Billboard Peak Positions].
