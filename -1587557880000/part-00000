Despite this, the combined per capita crime rate of the 33rd and 34th precincts was lower than that of the Harlem precincts in 2019, with significantly lower rates of murder (50.5%), rape (49.2%), felony assault (39.2%), and robbery (37%), in addition to slightly lower rates of burglary (8.7%) and grand larceny (5.8%); the one exception was motor vehicle theft, which was 13.6% higher in the Washington Heights precincts.<ref name=\"crime map\"/><ref name=\"NYPD 30th Precinct CS\">{{cite web|url=https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/nypd/downloads/pdf/crime_statistics/cs-en-us-030pct.pdf|title=30th Precinct CompStat Report|date=|format=PDF|publisher=[[New York City Police Department]]|access-date=April 16, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"NYPD 32nd Precinct CS\">{{cite web|url=https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/nypd/downloads/pdf/crime_statistics/cs-en-us-032pct.pdf|title=32nd Precinct CompStat Report|date=|format=PDF|publisher=[[New York City Police Department]]|access-date=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe crime drop, which was felt across all major cities, owed itself largely to the decrease in new users and dealers of crack cocaine, and the move of existing dealers from dealing on the streets to dealing from inside apartments.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/17/nyregion/where-has-your-neighborhood-drug-dealer-gone.html|title=Where Has Your Neighborhood Drug Dealer Gone?|last=Rohde|first=David|date=August 17, 1997|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=April 17, 2020|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/19/us/crack-s-legacy-a-special-report-a-drug-ran-its-course-then-hid-with-its-users.html|first=Timothy|last=Egan|accessdate=April 17, 2020|date=September 19, 1999|title=CRACK'S LEGACY: A special report; A Drug Ran Its Course, Then Hid With Its Users|work=[[The New York Times]]|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In Washington Heights, this meant a move back to the established cocaine dealing culture that had existed before the introduction of crack.

The benzene molecule is composed of six carbon atoms joined in a ring with one hydrogen atom attached to each. As it contains only carbon and hydrogen atoms, benzene is classed as a [[hydrocarbon]].\n\nBenzene is a natural constituent of [[petroleum|crude oil]] and is one of the elementary [[petrochemical]]s. Due to the cyclic continuous [[pi bond]]s between the carbon atoms, benzene is classed as an [[aromatic hydrocarbon]], the second [''n'']-[[annulene]] ([6]-annulene). It is sometimes abbreviated [[Phenyl|Ph]]H. Benzene is a [[color]]less and highly [[flammable]] liquid with a sweet smell, and is responsible for the aroma around petrol (gasoline) stations. It is used primarily as a precursor to the manufacture of chemicals with more complex structure, such as [[ethylbenzene]] and [[cumene]], of which billions of kilograms are produced annually. As benzene has a high [[octane number]], aromatic derivatives like [[toluene]] and [[xylene]] typically comprise up to 25% of [[gasoline]] (petrol). Benzene itself has been limited to less than 1% in gasoline because it is a known human [[carcinogen]]. Most non-industrial applications have been limited as well for the same reason.\n\n==History==\n\n===Discovery===\nThe word \"benzene\" derives from \"gum benzoin\" ([[benzoin resin]]), an aromatic resin known to European pharmacists and perfumers since the 16th century as a product of southeast Asia.<ref>The word \"benzoin\" is derived from the Arabic expression \"''luban jawi''\", or \"[[frankincense]] of [[Java]]\". {{cite book|last=Morris|first=Edwin T.|title=Fragrance: The Story of Perfume from Cleopatra to Chanel|year=1984|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|isbn=978-0684181950|page=101}}</ref> An acidic material was derived from benzoin by [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]], and named \"flowers of benzoin\", or benzoic acid.

Thus on page 44, Mitscherlich states:  ''\"Da diese Fl\u00fcssigkeit aus der Benzo\u00ebs\u00e4ure gewonnen wird, und wahrscheinlich mit den Benzoylverbindungen im Zusammenhang steht, so gibt man ihr am besten den Namen Benzol, da der Name Benzo\u00efn schon f\u00fcr die mit dem Bittermandel\u00f6l isomerische Verbindung von Liebig und W\u00f6hler gew\u00e4hlt worden ist.\"''  (Since this liquid [benzene] is obtained from benzoic acid and probably is related to benzoyl compounds, the best name for it is \"benzol\", since the name \"benzo\u00efn\" has already been chosen, by Liebig and W\u00f6hler, for the compound that's isomeric with the oil of bitter almonds [benzaldehyde].)</ref> In 1836, the French chemist [[Auguste Laurent]] named the substance \"ph\u00e8ne\";<ref>Laurent, Auguste (1836) \"Sur la chloroph\u00e9nise et les acides chloroph\u00e9nisique et chloroph\u00e9n\u00e8sique,\" ''Annales de Chemie et de Physique'', vol. 63, pp. 27\u201345, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lx0AAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA44#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 44]:  ''\"Je donne le nom de ph\u00e8ne au radical fondamental des acides pr\u00e9c\u00e9dens (\u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9, j'\u00e9claire), puisque la benzine se trouve dans le gaz de l'\u00e9clairage.\"''  (I give the name of \"ph\u00e8ne\" (\u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9, I illuminate) to the fundamental radical of the preceding acids, because benzene is found in illuminating gas.)</ref> this word has become the root of the English word \"[[phenol]]\", which is [[hydroxylated]] benzene, and \"[[phenyl]]\", the radical formed by abstraction of a hydrogen atom ([[free radical]] H\u2022) from benzene.\n[[File:Historic Benzene Formulae Kekul\u00e9 (original).png|thumb|left|300px|Kekul\u00e9's 1872 modification of his 1865 theory, illustrating rapid alternation of double bonds<ref group=note>Critics pointed out a  problem with Kekul\u00e9's original (1865) structure for benzene:  Whenever benzene underwent substitution at the ortho position, two distinguishable isomers should have resulted, depending on whether a double bond or a single bond existed between the carbon atoms to which the substituents were attached; however, no such isomers were observed.  In 1872, Kekul\u00e9 suggested that benzene had two complementary structures and that these forms rapidly interconverted, so that if there were a double bond between any pair of carbon atoms at one instant, that double bond would become a single bond at the next instant (and vice versa).  To provide a mechanism for the conversion process, Kekul\u00e9 proposed that the valency of an atom is determined by the frequency with which it collided with its neighbors in a molecule.  As the carbon atoms in the benzene ring collided with each other, each carbon atom would collide twice with one neighbor during a given interval and then twice with its other neighbor during the next interval.  Thus, a double bond would exist with one neighbor during the first interval and with the other neighbor during the next interval.  Therefore, between the carbon atoms of benzene there were no fixed (i.e., constant) and distinct single or double bonds; instead, the bonds between the carbon atoms were identical.  See [http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:Kekule_-_Ueber_einige_Condensationsproducte_des_Aldehyds.pdf&page=10 pages 86\u201389] of Auguste Kekul\u00e9 (1872) \"Ueber einige Condensationsprodukte des Aldehyds\" (On some condensation products of aldehydes), ''Liebig's Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie'', '''162'''(1): 77\u2013124, 309\u2013320.  From p. 89:  ''\"Das einfachste Mittel aller St\u00f6\u00dfe eines Kohlenstoffatoms ergiebt sich aus der Summe der St\u00f6\u00dfe der beiden ersten Zeiteinheiten, die sich dann periodisch wiederholen.  \u2026 man sieht daher, da\u00df jedes Kohlenstoffatom mit den beiden anderen, \u2026 da\u00df diese Verschiedenheit nur eine scheinbare, aber keine wirkliche ist.\"'' (The simplest average of all the collisions of a carbon atom [in benzene] comes from the sum of the collisions during the first two units of time, which then periodically repeat.  \u2026 thus one sees that each carbon atom collides equally often with the two others against which it bumps, [and] thus stands in exactly the same relation with its two neighbors.  The usual structural formula for benzene expresses, of course, only the collisions that occur during ''one'' unit of time, thus during one phase, and so one is led to the view [that] doubly substituted derivatives [of benzene] must be different at positions 1,2 and 1,6 [of the benzene ring].

This discovery led to the production of [[Sanka]]. This process was later discontinued. Benzene was historically used as a significant component in many consumer products such as [[Liquid Wrench]], several [[paint stripper]]s, [[rubber cement]]s, spot removers, and other products.

It is a byproduct of the incomplete combustion of many materials.  For commercial use, until [[World War II]], most benzene was obtained as a by-product of [[coke (fuel)|coke]] production (or \"coke-oven light oil\") for the [[steel]] industry. However, in the 1950s, increased demand for benzene, especially from the growing [[polymer]]s industry, necessitated the production of benzene from petroleum.

The aromatic products of the reaction are then separated from the reaction mixture (or reformate) by [[Liquid-liquid extraction|extraction]] with any one of a number of [[solvent]]s, including [[diethylene glycol]] or [[sulfolane]], and benzene is then separated from the other aromatics by distillation. The extraction step of aromatics from the reformate is designed to produce aromatics with lowest non-aromatic components. Recovery of the aromatics, commonly referred to as [[BTX (chemistry)|BTX]] (benzene, toluene and xylene isomers), involves such extraction and distillation steps. There are a good many licensed processes available for extraction of the aromatics.\n\nIn similar fashion to this catalytic reforming, [[UOP LLC|UOP]] and [[BP]] commercialized a method from LPG (mainly propane and butane) to aromatics.\n\n===Toluene hydrodealkylation===\nToluene [[hydrodealkylation]] converts [[toluene]] to benzene. In this hydrogen-intensive process, toluene is mixed with hydrogen, then passed over a [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], or [[platinum]] [[oxide]] catalyst at 500\u2013600&nbsp;\u00b0C and 40\u201360 atm pressure. Sometimes, higher temperatures are used instead of a catalyst (at the similar reaction condition). Under these conditions, toluene undergoes dealkylation to benzene and [[methane]]:\n\n:C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> \u2192 C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> + CH<sub>4</sub>\n\nThis irreversible reaction is accompanied by an equilibrium side reaction that produces\n[[biphenyl]] (aka diphenyl) at higher temperature:\n\n:2 {{chem|C|6|H|6}} {{eqm}} {{chem|H|2}} + {{chem|C|6|H|5|\u2013C|6|H|5}}\n\nIf the raw material stream contains much non-aromatic components (paraffins or naphthenes), those are likely decomposed to lower hydrocarbons such as methane, which increases the consumption of hydrogen.\n\nA typical reaction yield exceeds 95%. Sometimes, [[xylene]]s and heavier aromatics are used in place of toluene, with similar efficiency.\n\nThis is often called \"on-purpose\" methodology to produce benzene, compared to conventional BTX (benzene-toluene-xylene) extraction processes.\n\n===Toluene disproportionation===\nWhere a chemical complex has similar demands for both benzene and [[xylene]], then toluene [[disproportionation]] ('''TDP''') may be an attractive alternative to the toluene hydrodealkylation. In the broad sense, two toluene molecules are reacted and the methyl groups rearranged from one toluene molecule to the other, yielding one benzene molecule and one xylene molecule.\n\nGiven that demand for ''para''-xylene ([[P-Xylene|''p''-xylene]]) substantially exceeds demand for other xylene isomers, a refinement of the TDP process called '''Selective TDP''' (STDP) may be used. In this process, the xylene stream exiting the TDP unit is approximately 90% paraxylene. In some current catalytic systems, even the benzene-to-xylenes ratio is decreased (more xylenes) when the demand of xylenes is higher.\n\n===Steam cracking===\n[[Steam cracking]] is the process for producing [[ethylene]] and other [[alkene]]s from [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatic hydrocarbons]]. Depending on the feedstock used to produce the olefins, steam cracking can produce a benzene-rich liquid by-product called ''[[pyrolysis gasoline]]''. Pyrolysis gasoline can be blended with other hydrocarbons as a gasoline additive, or routed through an extraction process to recover [[BTX (chemistry)|BTX]] aromatics (benzene, toluene and xylenes).\n\n=== Other methods ===\nAlthough of no commercial significance, many other routes to benzene exist. [[Phenol]] and [[halobenzene]]s can be reduced with metals. [[Benzoic acid]] and its salts undergo [[decarboxylation]] to benzene.  Via the reaction the [[diazonium compound]] with [[hypophosphorus acid]] [[aniline]] gives benzene. [[Trimerization]] of [[acetylene]] gives benzene.\n\n==Uses==\nBenzene is used mainly as an intermediate to make other chemicals, above all [[ethylbenzene]], [[cumene]], [[cyclohexane]], nitrobenzene, and alkylbenzene. More than half of the entire benzene production is processed into ethylbenzene, a precursor to [[styrene]], which is used to make polymers and plastics like polystyrene and EPS. Some 20% of the benzene production is used to manufacture cumene, which is needed to produce [[phenol]] and acetone for resins and adhesives. [[Cyclohexane]] consumes around 10% of the world's benzene production; it is primarily used in the manufacture of nylon fibers, which are processed into textiles and engineering plastics. Smaller amounts of benzene are used to make some types of [[rubber]]s, [[lubricant]]s, [[dye]]s, [[detergent]]s, [[drug]]s, [[explosive]]s, and [[pesticide]]s. In 2013, the biggest consumer country of benzene was China, followed by the USA. Benzene production is currently expanding in the Middle East and in Africa, whereas production capacities in Western Europe and North America are stagnating.<ref name=\"Ceresana\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/chemicals/benzene/|title=Market Study: Benzene (2nd edition), Ceresana, August 2014|publisher=ceresana.com|accessdate=2015-02-10}}</ref>\n\n[[Toluene]] is now often used as a substitute for benzene, for instance as a fuel additive.

As a consequence, gasoline often contained several percent benzene before the 1950s, when [[tetraethyl lead]] replaced it as the most widely used antiknock additive. With the global phaseout of leaded gasoline, benzene has made a comeback as a gasoline additive in some nations. In the [[United States]], concern over its negative health effects and the possibility of benzene's entering the [[groundwater]] have led to stringent regulation of gasoline's benzene content, with limits typically around 1%.<ref>Kolmetz, Gentry, Guidelines for BTX Revamps, AIChE 2007 Spring Conference</ref> European petrol specifications now contain the same 1% limit on benzene content. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] introduced new regulations in 2011 that lowered the benzene content in gasoline to 0.62%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/EPA-AIR/2006/March/Day-29/a2315b.htm |title=Control of Hazardous Air Pollutants From Mobile Sources |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |page=15853 |accessdate=2008-06-27 |date=2006-03-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205233108/http://www.epa.gov/EPA-AIR/2006/March/Day-29/a2315b.htm |archivedate=2008-12-05 }}</ref>\nIn many European languages, the word for petroleum or gasoline is an exact cognate of \"benzene\".\n\n==Reactions==\nThe most common reactions of benzene involve substitution of a proton by other groups.<ref name=\"StranksEtAl1970\">\n{{Cite book\n| last = Stranks\n| first = D.

Benzene is sufficiently [[nucleophile|nucleophilic]] that it undergoes substitution by [[acylium]] ions and alkyl [[carbocation]]s to give substituted derivatives.\n:[[File:OChem-Mech-ElectrophilicAromaticSubstitution-General.png|thumb|center|450px|Electrophilic aromatic substitution of benzene]]\n\nThe most widely practiced example of this reaction is the [[ethylation]] of benzene.\n::[[File:EtC6H5route.png|320 px]]\nApproximately 24,700,000 tons were produced in 1999.<ref>Welch, Vincent A.; Fallon, Kevin J. and Gelbke, Heinz-Peter (2005) \"Ethylbenzene\" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a10_035.pub2}}</ref>\nHighly instructive but of far less industrial significance is the [[Friedel-Crafts alkylation]] of benzene (and many other aromatic rings) using an [[alkyl halide]] in the presence of a strong Lewis acid catalyst. Similarly, the [[Friedel-Crafts acylation]] is a related example of [[electrophilic aromatic substitution]]. The reaction involves the [[acylation]] of benzene (or many other aromatic rings) with an [[acyl chloride]] using a strong [[Lewis acid]] [[catalyst]] such as [[aluminium chloride]] or [[Iron(III) chloride]].\n\n[[File:Benzen acylowany.svg|thumb|center|300px|Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene by acetyl chloride]]\n\n===Sulfonation, chlorination, nitration===\nUsing electrophilic aromatic substitution, many functional groups are introduced onto the benzene framework.  [[Aromatic sulfonation|Sulfonation]] of benzene involves the use of [[oleum]], a mixture of sulfuric acid with [[sulfur trioxide]]. Sulfonated benzene derivatives are useful [[detergent]]s.  In [[nitration]], benzene reacts with nitronium ions (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>), which is a strong electrophile produced by combining sulfuric and nitric acids.  [[Nitrobenzene]] is the precursor to [[aniline]].  Chlorination is achieved with chlorine to give [[chlorobenzene]] in the presence of a catalyst such as aluminium tri-chloride.\n\n===Hydrogenation===\nVia [[hydrogenation]], benzene and its derivatives convert to [[cyclohexane]] and derivatives.  This reaction is achieved by the use of high pressures of [[hydrogen]] in the presence of [[heterogeneous catalyst]]s, such as finely divided [[nickel]].  Whereas alkenes can be hydrogenated near room temperatures, benzene and related compounds are more reluctant substrates, requiring temperatures >100&nbsp;\u00b0C.  This reaction is practiced on a large scale industrially. In the absence of the catalyst, benzene is impervious to hydrogen.  Hydrogenation cannot be stopped to give cyclohexene or cyclohexadienes as these are superior substrates.  [[Birch reduction]], a non catalytic process, however selectively hydrogenates benzene to the diene.\n\n===Metal complexes===\nBenzene is an excellent [[ligand]] in the [[complex (chemistry)|organometallic]] chemistry of low-valent metals. Important examples include the sandwich and half-sandwich complexes, respectively, [[Bis(benzene)chromium|Cr(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]] and [[(Benzene)ruthenium dichloride dimer|[RuCl<sub>2</sub>(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>)]<sub>2</sub>]].\n\n==Health effects==\n[[File:Benzol.JPG|A bottle of benzene.

Benzene itself can be measured in breath, blood or urine, but such testing is usually limited to the first 24 hours post-exposure due to the relatively rapid removal of the chemical by exhalation or biotransformation. Most people in developed countries have measureable baseline levels of benzene and other aromatic petroleum hydrocarbons in their blood. In the body, benzene is enzymatically converted to a series of oxidation products including [[muconic acid]], [[phenylmercapturic acid]], [[phenol]], [[catechol]], [[hydroquinone]] and [[Hydroxyquinol|1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene]]. Most of these metabolites have some value as biomarkers of human exposure, since they accumulate in the urine in proportion to the extent and duration of exposure, and they may still be present for some days after exposure has ceased. The current ACGIH biological exposure limits for occupational exposure are 500 \u03bcg/g creatinine for muconic acid and 25 \u03bcg/g creatinine for phenylmercapturic acid in an end-of-shift urine specimen.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ashley|pmid=8013127|first1=DL|year=1994|pages=1401\u20134|issue=7 Pt 2|last2=Bonin|volume=40|journal=Clinical Chemistry|first2=MA|last3=Cardinali|first3=FL|last4=McCraw|first4=JM|last5=Wooten|first5=JV|title=Blood concentrations of volatile organic compounds in a nonoccupationally exposed US population and in groups with suspected exposure|doi=10.1093/clinchem/40.7.1401|url=http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/reprint/40/7/1401.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Fustinoni S, Buratti M, Campo L, Colombi A, Consonni D, Pesatori AC, Bonzini M, Farmer P, Garte S, Valerio F, Merlo DF, Bertazzi PA |title=Urinary t,t-muconic acid, S-phenylmercapturic acid and benzene as biomarkers of low benzene exposure|journal=Chemico-Biological Interactions|volume=153\u2013154|pages=253\u20136|year=2005|pmid=15935823|doi=10.1016/j.cbi.2005.03.031}}</ref><ref>ACGIH (2009).

In bacteria, [[dioxygenase]] enzyme can add an [[oxygen]] to the ring, and the unstable product is immediately reduced (by [[NADH]]) to a cyclic [[diol]] with two double bonds, breaking the aromaticity. Next, the diol is newly reduced by NADH to [[catechol]]. The catechol is then metabolized to [[acetyl CoA]] and [[succinyl CoA]], used by organisms mainly in the [[Krebs Cycle]] for energy production.\n\nThe pathway for the metabolism of benzene is complex and begins in the liver.  Several enzymes are involved.  These include [[cytochrome P450]] 2E1 (CYP2E1), quinine oxidoreductase (NQ01 or DT-diaphorase or [[NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone 1)]]), GSH, and myeloperoxidase (MPO).  CYP2E1 is involved at multiple steps: converting benzene to [[oxepin]] (benzene oxide), [[phenol]] to [[hydroquinone]], and hydroquinone to both benzenetriol and [[catechol]].  Hydroquinone, benzenetriol and catechol are converted to polyphenols.  In the bone marrow, MPO converts these polyphenols to benzoquinones.  These intermediates and metabolites induce genotoxicity by multiple mechanisms including inhibition of topoisomerase II (which maintains chromosome structure), disruption of microtubules (which maintains cellular structure and organization), generation of oxygen free radicals (unstable species) that may lead to point mutations, increasing oxidative stress, inducing DNA strand breaks, and altering DNA methylation (which can affect gene expression).  NQ01 and GSH shift metabolism away from toxicity.  NQ01 metabolizes benzoquinone toward polyphenols (counteracting the effect of MPO).  GSH is involved with the formation of phenylmercapturic acid.<ref name=\"Smith 2010 133\u201348\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Snyder|first=R|author2=Hedli, C.C.|title=An overview of benzene metabolism|journal=Environ Health Perspect|year=1996|volume=104|pages=1165\u20131171|pmid=9118888|pmc=1469747|issue=Suppl 6|doi=10.1289/ehp.96104s61165}}</ref>\n\nGenetic polymorphisms in these enzymes may induce loss of function or gain of function.

The benzene molecule is composed of six carbon atoms joined in a ring with one hydrogen atom attached to each. As it contains only carbon and hydrogen atoms, benzene is classed as a [[hydrocarbon]].\n\nBenzene is a natural constituent of [[petroleum|crude oil]] and is one of the elementary [[petrochemical]]s. Due to the cyclic continuous [[pi bond]]s between the carbon atoms, benzene is classed as an [[aromatic hydrocarbon]], the second [''n'']-[[annulene]] ([6]-annulene). It is sometimes abbreviated [[Phenyl|Ph]]H. Benzene is a [[color]]less and highly [[flammable]] liquid with a sweet smell, and is responsible for the aroma around petrol (gasoline) stations. It is used primarily as a precursor to the manufacture of chemicals with more complex structure, such as [[ethylbenzene]] and [[cumene]], of which billions of kilograms are produced annually. As benzene has a high [[octane number]], aromatic derivatives like [[toluene]] and [[xylene]] typically comprise up to 25% of [[gasoline]] (petrol). Benzene itself has been limited to less than 1% in gasoline because it is a known human [[carcinogen]]. Most non-industrial applications have been limited as well for the same reason.\n\n==History==\n\n===Discovery===\nThe word \"benzene\" derives from \"gum benzoin\" ([[benzoin resin]]), an aromatic resin known to European pharmacists and perfumers since the 16th century as a product of southeast Asia.<ref>The word \"benzoin\" is derived from the Arabic expression \"''luban jawi''\", or \"[[frankincense]] of [[Java]]\". {{cite book|last=Morris|first=Edwin T.|title=Fragrance: The Story of Perfume from Cleopatra to Chanel|year=1984|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|isbn=978-0684181950|page=101}}</ref> An acidic material was derived from benzoin by [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]], and named \"flowers of benzoin\", or benzoic acid.

Thus on page 44, Mitscherlich states:  ''\"Da diese Fl\u00fcssigkeit aus der Benzo\u00ebs\u00e4ure gewonnen wird, und wahrscheinlich mit den Benzoylverbindungen im Zusammenhang steht, so gibt man ihr am besten den Namen Benzol, da der Name Benzo\u00efn schon f\u00fcr die mit dem Bittermandel\u00f6l isomerische Verbindung von Liebig und W\u00f6hler gew\u00e4hlt worden ist.\"''  (Since this liquid [benzene] is obtained from benzoic acid and probably is related to benzoyl compounds, the best name for it is \"benzol\", since the name \"benzo\u00efn\" has already been chosen, by Liebig and W\u00f6hler, for the compound that's isomeric with the oil of bitter almonds [benzaldehyde].)</ref> In 1836, the French chemist [[Auguste Laurent]] named the substance \"ph\u00e8ne\";<ref>Laurent, Auguste (1836) \"Sur la chloroph\u00e9nise et les acides chloroph\u00e9nisique et chloroph\u00e9n\u00e8sique,\" ''Annales de Chemie et de Physique'', vol. 63, pp. 27\u201345, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lx0AAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA44#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 44]:  ''\"Je donne le nom de ph\u00e8ne au radical fondamental des acides pr\u00e9c\u00e9dens (\u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9, j'\u00e9claire), puisque la benzine se trouve dans le gaz de l'\u00e9clairage.\"''  (I give the name of \"ph\u00e8ne\" (\u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9, I illuminate) to the fundamental radical of the preceding acids, because benzene is found in illuminating gas.)</ref> this word has become the root of the English word \"[[phenol]]\", which is [[hydroxylated]] benzene, and \"[[phenyl]]\", the radical formed by abstraction of a hydrogen atom ([[free radical]] H\u2022) from benzene.\n[[File:Historic Benzene Formulae Kekul\u00e9 (original).png|thumb|left|300px|Kekul\u00e9's 1872 modification of his 1865 theory, illustrating rapid alternation of double bonds<ref group=note>Critics pointed out a  problem with Kekul\u00e9's original (1865) structure for benzene:  Whenever benzene underwent substitution at the ortho position, two distinguishable isomers should have resulted, depending on whether a double bond or a single bond existed between the carbon atoms to which the substituents were attached; however, no such isomers were observed.  In 1872, Kekul\u00e9 suggested that benzene had two complementary structures and that these forms rapidly interconverted, so that if there were a double bond between any pair of carbon atoms at one instant, that double bond would become a single bond at the next instant (and vice versa).  To provide a mechanism for the conversion process, Kekul\u00e9 proposed that the valency of an atom is determined by the frequency with which it collided with its neighbors in a molecule.  As the carbon atoms in the benzene ring collided with each other, each carbon atom would collide twice with one neighbor during a given interval and then twice with its other neighbor during the next interval.  Thus, a double bond would exist with one neighbor during the first interval and with the other neighbor during the next interval.  Therefore, between the carbon atoms of benzene there were no fixed (i.e., constant) and distinct single or double bonds; instead, the bonds between the carbon atoms were identical.  See [http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:Kekule_-_Ueber_einige_Condensationsproducte_des_Aldehyds.pdf&page=10 pages 86\u201389] of Auguste Kekul\u00e9 (1872) \"Ueber einige Condensationsprodukte des Aldehyds\" (On some condensation products of aldehydes), ''Liebig's Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie'', '''162'''(1): 77\u2013124, 309\u2013320.  From p. 89:  ''\"Das einfachste Mittel aller St\u00f6\u00dfe eines Kohlenstoffatoms ergiebt sich aus der Summe der St\u00f6\u00dfe der beiden ersten Zeiteinheiten, die sich dann periodisch wiederholen.  \u2026 man sieht daher, da\u00df jedes Kohlenstoffatom mit den beiden anderen, \u2026 da\u00df diese Verschiedenheit nur eine scheinbare, aber keine wirkliche ist.\"'' (The simplest average of all the collisions of a carbon atom [in benzene] comes from the sum of the collisions during the first two units of time, which then periodically repeat.  \u2026 thus one sees that each carbon atom collides equally often with the two others against which it bumps, [and] thus stands in exactly the same relation with its two neighbors.  The usual structural formula for benzene expresses, of course, only the collisions that occur during ''one'' unit of time, thus during one phase, and so one is led to the view [that] doubly substituted derivatives [of benzene] must be different at positions 1,2 and 1,6 [of the benzene ring].  If the idea [that was] just presented \u2014 or a similar one \u2014 can be regarded as correct, then [it] follows therefrom that this difference [between the bonds at positions 1,2 and 1,6] is only an apparent [one], not a real [one].)</ref>]]\n\nIn 1845, [[Charles Blachford Mansfield|Charles Mansfield]], working under [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]], isolated benzene from [[coal tar]].<ref>Hofmann, A.

To accurately reflect the nature of the bonding, benzene is often depicted with a circle inside a hexagonal arrangement of carbon atoms.\n\nDerivatives of benzene occur sufficiently often as a component of organic molecules that the [[Unicode]] Consortium has allocated a symbol in the [[Miscellaneous Technical (Unicode)|Miscellaneous Technical]] block with the code U+232C (\u232c) to represent it with three double bonds,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/232c/index.htm |title=Unicode Character 'BENZENE RING' (U+232C) |accessdate=2009-01-16|website=fileformat.info}}</ref> and U+23E3 (\u23e3) for a delocalized version.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/23e3/index.htm |title=Unicode Character 'BENZENE RING WITH CIRCLE' (U+23E3) |accessdate=2009-01-16|website=fileformat.info}}</ref>\n\n==Benzene derivatives==\n{{Main|Aromatic hydrocarbons|Alkylbenzenes}}\nMany important chemical compounds are derived from benzene by replacing one or more of its hydrogen atoms with another [[functional group]]. Examples of simple benzene derivatives are [[phenol]], [[toluene]], and [[aniline]], abbreviated PhOH, PhMe, and PhNH<sub>2</sub>, respectively. Linking benzene rings gives [[biphenyl]], C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>\u2013C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>. Further loss of hydrogen gives \"fused\" aromatic hydrocarbons, such as [[naphthalene]], [[anthracene]], [[phenanthrene]], and [[pyrene]]. The limit of the fusion process is the hydrogen-free allotrope of carbon, [[graphite]].\n\nIn [[heterocyclic chemistry|heterocycles]], carbon atoms in the benzene ring are replaced with other elements. The most important variations contain [[nitrogen]]. Replacing one CH with N gives the compound [[pyridine]], C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N. Although benzene and pyridine are ''structurally'' related, benzene cannot be converted into pyridine. Replacement of a second CH bond with N gives, depending on the location of the second N, [[pyridazine]], [[pyrimidine]], or [[pyrazine]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www2.chemistry.msu.edu/faculty/reusch/virttxtjml/heterocy.htm | title = Heterocyclic Chemistry: Heterocyclic Compounds | publisher = [[Michigan State University]], Department of Chemistry}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nFour chemical processes contribute to industrial benzene production: [[catalytic reforming]], [[toluene]] hydrodealkylation, toluene disproportionation, and [[steam cracking]]. According to the [[ATSDR]] Toxicological Profile for benzene, between 1978 and 1981, catalytic reformates accounted for approximately 44\u201350% of the total U.S benzene production.<ref name=Ullmann>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Hillis O. Folkins|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|encyclopedia=Ullmann\u2019s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|publisher=Wiley-VCH|place=Weinheim|year=2005|doi=10.1002/14356007.a03_475|isbn=978-3527306732|chapter=Benzene}}</ref>\n\n===Catalytic reforming===\nIn catalytic reforming, a mixture of [[hydrocarbon]]s with boiling points between 60\u2013200&nbsp;\u00b0C is blended with [[hydrogen]] gas and then exposed to a [[bifunctional]] [[platinum(II) chloride|platinum chloride]] or [[rhenium]] chloride [[catalyst]] at 500\u2013525&nbsp;\u00b0C and pressures ranging from 8\u201350 atm. Under these conditions, [[aliphatic]] hydrocarbons form rings and lose hydrogen to become aromatic hydrocarbons. The aromatic products of the reaction are then separated from the reaction mixture (or reformate) by [[Liquid-liquid extraction|extraction]] with any one of a number of [[solvent]]s, including [[diethylene glycol]] or [[sulfolane]], and benzene is then separated from the other aromatics by distillation. The extraction step of aromatics from the reformate is designed to produce aromatics with lowest non-aromatic components. Recovery of the aromatics, commonly referred to as [[BTX (chemistry)|BTX]] (benzene, toluene and xylene isomers), involves such extraction and distillation steps. There are a good many licensed processes available for extraction of the aromatics.\n\nIn similar fashion to this catalytic reforming, [[UOP LLC|UOP]] and [[BP]] commercialized a method from LPG (mainly propane and butane) to aromatics.\n\n===Toluene hydrodealkylation===\nToluene [[hydrodealkylation]] converts [[toluene]] to benzene. In this hydrogen-intensive process, toluene is mixed with hydrogen, then passed over a [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], or [[platinum]] [[oxide]] catalyst at 500\u2013600&nbsp;\u00b0C and 40\u201360 atm pressure. Sometimes, higher temperatures are used instead of a catalyst (at the similar reaction condition). Under these conditions, toluene undergoes dealkylation to benzene and [[methane]]:\n\n:C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> \u2192 C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> + CH<sub>4</sub>\n\nThis irreversible reaction is accompanied by an equilibrium side reaction that produces\n[[biphenyl]] (aka diphenyl) at higher temperature:\n\n:2 {{chem|C|6|H|6}} {{eqm}} {{chem|H|2}} + {{chem|C|6|H|5|\u2013C|6|H|5}}\n\nIf the raw material stream contains much non-aromatic components (paraffins or naphthenes), those are likely decomposed to lower hydrocarbons such as methane, which increases the consumption of hydrogen.\n\nA typical reaction yield exceeds 95%. Sometimes, [[xylene]]s and heavier aromatics are used in place of toluene, with similar efficiency.\n\nThis is often called \"on-purpose\" methodology to produce benzene, compared to conventional BTX (benzene-toluene-xylene) extraction processes.\n\n===Toluene disproportionation===\nWhere a chemical complex has similar demands for both benzene and [[xylene]], then toluene [[disproportionation]] ('''TDP''') may be an attractive alternative to the toluene hydrodealkylation. In the broad sense, two toluene molecules are reacted and the methyl groups rearranged from one toluene molecule to the other, yielding one benzene molecule and one xylene molecule.\n\nGiven that demand for ''para''-xylene ([[P-Xylene|''p''-xylene]]) substantially exceeds demand for other xylene isomers, a refinement of the TDP process called '''Selective TDP''' (STDP) may be used. In this process, the xylene stream exiting the TDP unit is approximately 90% paraxylene. In some current catalytic systems, even the benzene-to-xylenes ratio is decreased (more xylenes) when the demand of xylenes is higher.\n\n===Steam cracking===\n[[Steam cracking]] is the process for producing [[ethylene]] and other [[alkene]]s from [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatic hydrocarbons]]. Depending on the feedstock used to produce the olefins, steam cracking can produce a benzene-rich liquid by-product called ''[[pyrolysis gasoline]]''. Pyrolysis gasoline can be blended with other hydrocarbons as a gasoline additive, or routed through an extraction process to recover [[BTX (chemistry)|BTX]] aromatics (benzene, toluene and xylenes).\n\n=== Other methods ===\nAlthough of no commercial significance, many other routes to benzene exist. [[Phenol]] and [[halobenzene]]s can be reduced with metals. [[Benzoic acid]] and its salts undergo [[decarboxylation]] to benzene.  Via the reaction the [[diazonium compound]] with [[hypophosphorus acid]] [[aniline]] gives benzene. [[Trimerization]] of [[acetylene]] gives benzene.\n\n==Uses==\nBenzene is used mainly as an intermediate to make other chemicals, above all [[ethylbenzene]], [[cumene]], [[cyclohexane]], nitrobenzene, and alkylbenzene. More than half of the entire benzene production is processed into ethylbenzene, a precursor to [[styrene]], which is used to make polymers and plastics like polystyrene and EPS. Some 20% of the benzene production is used to manufacture cumene, which is needed to produce [[phenol]] and acetone for resins and adhesives. [[Cyclohexane]] consumes around 10% of the world's benzene production; it is primarily used in the manufacture of nylon fibers, which are processed into textiles and engineering plastics. Smaller amounts of benzene are used to make some types of [[rubber]]s, [[lubricant]]s, [[dye]]s, [[detergent]]s, [[drug]]s, [[explosive]]s, and [[pesticide]]s. In 2013, the biggest consumer country of benzene was China, followed by the USA. Benzene production is currently expanding in the Middle East and in Africa, whereas production capacities in Western Europe and North America are stagnating.<ref name=\"Ceresana\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/chemicals/benzene/|title=Market Study: Benzene (2nd edition), Ceresana, August 2014|publisher=ceresana.com|accessdate=2015-02-10}}</ref>\n\n[[Toluene]] is now often used as a substitute for benzene, for instance as a fuel additive.

As a consequence, gasoline often contained several percent benzene before the 1950s, when [[tetraethyl lead]] replaced it as the most widely used antiknock additive. With the global phaseout of leaded gasoline, benzene has made a comeback as a gasoline additive in some nations. In the [[United States]], concern over its negative health effects and the possibility of benzene's entering the [[groundwater]] have led to stringent regulation of gasoline's benzene content, with limits typically around 1%.<ref>Kolmetz, Gentry, Guidelines for BTX Revamps, AIChE 2007 Spring Conference</ref> European petrol specifications now contain the same 1% limit on benzene content. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] introduced new regulations in 2011 that lowered the benzene content in gasoline to 0.62%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/EPA-AIR/2006/March/Day-29/a2315b.htm |title=Control of Hazardous Air Pollutants From Mobile Sources |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |page=15853 |accessdate=2008-06-27 |date=2006-03-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205233108/http://www.epa.gov/EPA-AIR/2006/March/Day-29/a2315b.htm |archivedate=2008-12-05 }}</ref>\nIn many European languages, the word for petroleum or gasoline is an exact cognate of \"benzene\".\n\n==Reactions==\nThe most common reactions of benzene involve substitution of a proton by other groups.<ref name=\"StranksEtAl1970\">\n{{Cite book\n| last = Stranks\n| first = D.

Benzene is sufficiently [[nucleophile|nucleophilic]] that it undergoes substitution by [[acylium]] ions and alkyl [[carbocation]]s to give substituted derivatives.\n:[[File:OChem-Mech-ElectrophilicAromaticSubstitution-General.png|thumb|center|450px|Electrophilic aromatic substitution of benzene]]\n\nThe most widely practiced example of this reaction is the [[ethylation]] of benzene.\n::[[File:EtC6H5route.png|320 px]]\nApproximately 24,700,000 tons were produced in 1999.<ref>Welch, Vincent A.; Fallon, Kevin J. and Gelbke, Heinz-Peter (2005) \"Ethylbenzene\" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a10_035.pub2}}</ref>\nHighly instructive but of far less industrial significance is the [[Friedel-Crafts alkylation]] of benzene (and many other aromatic rings) using an [[alkyl halide]] in the presence of a strong Lewis acid catalyst. Similarly, the [[Friedel-Crafts acylation]] is a related example of [[electrophilic aromatic substitution]]. The reaction involves the [[acylation]] of benzene (or many other aromatic rings) with an [[acyl chloride]] using a strong [[Lewis acid]] [[catalyst]] such as [[aluminium chloride]] or [[Iron(III) chloride]].\n\n[[File:Benzen acylowany.svg|thumb|center|300px|Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene by acetyl chloride]]\n\n===Sulfonation, chlorination, nitration===\nUsing electrophilic aromatic substitution, many functional groups are introduced onto the benzene framework.  [[Aromatic sulfonation|Sulfonation]] of benzene involves the use of [[oleum]], a mixture of sulfuric acid with [[sulfur trioxide]]. Sulfonated benzene derivatives are useful [[detergent]]s.  In [[nitration]], benzene reacts with nitronium ions (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>), which is a strong electrophile produced by combining sulfuric and nitric acids.  [[Nitrobenzene]] is the precursor to [[aniline]].  Chlorination is achieved with chlorine to give [[chlorobenzene]] in the presence of a catalyst such as aluminium tri-chloride.\n\n===Hydrogenation===\nVia [[hydrogenation]], benzene and its derivatives convert to [[cyclohexane]] and derivatives.  This reaction is achieved by the use of high pressures of [[hydrogen]] in the presence of [[heterogeneous catalyst]]s, such as finely divided [[nickel]].  Whereas alkenes can be hydrogenated near room temperatures, benzene and related compounds are more reluctant substrates, requiring temperatures >100&nbsp;\u00b0C.  This reaction is practiced on a large scale industrially. In the absence of the catalyst, benzene is impervious to hydrogen.  Hydrogenation cannot be stopped to give cyclohexene or cyclohexadienes as these are superior substrates.  [[Birch reduction]], a non catalytic process, however selectively hydrogenates benzene to the diene.\n\n===Metal complexes===\nBenzene is an excellent [[ligand]] in the [[complex (chemistry)|organometallic]] chemistry of low-valent metals. Important examples include the sandwich and half-sandwich complexes, respectively, [[Bis(benzene)chromium|Cr(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]] and [[(Benzene)ruthenium dichloride dimer|[RuCl<sub>2</sub>(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>)]<sub>2</sub>]].\n\n==Health effects==\n[[File:Benzol.JPG|A bottle of benzene.

Benzene itself can be measured in breath, blood or urine, but such testing is usually limited to the first 24 hours post-exposure due to the relatively rapid removal of the chemical by exhalation or biotransformation. Most people in developed countries have measureable baseline levels of benzene and other aromatic petroleum hydrocarbons in their blood. In the body, benzene is enzymatically converted to a series of oxidation products including [[muconic acid]], [[phenylmercapturic acid]], [[phenol]], [[catechol]], [[hydroquinone]] and [[Hydroxyquinol|1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene]]. Most of these metabolites have some value as biomarkers of human exposure, since they accumulate in the urine in proportion to the extent and duration of exposure, and they may still be present for some days after exposure has ceased. The current ACGIH biological exposure limits for occupational exposure are 500 \u03bcg/g creatinine for muconic acid and 25 \u03bcg/g creatinine for phenylmercapturic acid in an end-of-shift urine specimen.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ashley|pmid=8013127|first1=DL|year=1994|pages=1401\u20134|issue=7 Pt 2|last2=Bonin|volume=40|journal=Clinical Chemistry|first2=MA|last3=Cardinali|first3=FL|last4=McCraw|first4=JM|last5=Wooten|first5=JV|title=Blood concentrations of volatile organic compounds in a nonoccupationally exposed US population and in groups with suspected exposure|doi=10.1093/clinchem/40.7.1401|url=http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/reprint/40/7/1401.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Fustinoni S, Buratti M, Campo L, Colombi A, Consonni D, Pesatori AC, Bonzini M, Farmer P, Garte S, Valerio F, Merlo DF, Bertazzi PA |title=Urinary t,t-muconic acid, S-phenylmercapturic acid and benzene as biomarkers of low benzene exposure|journal=Chemico-Biological Interactions|volume=153\u2013154|pages=253\u20136|year=2005|pmid=15935823|doi=10.1016/j.cbi.2005.03.031}}</ref><ref>ACGIH (2009).

In bacteria, [[dioxygenase]] enzyme can add an [[oxygen]] to the ring, and the unstable product is immediately reduced (by [[NADH]]) to a cyclic [[diol]] with two double bonds, breaking the aromaticity. Next, the diol is newly reduced by NADH to [[catechol]]. The catechol is then metabolized to [[acetyl CoA]] and [[succinyl CoA]], used by organisms mainly in the [[Krebs Cycle]] for energy production.\n\nThe pathway for the metabolism of benzene is complex and begins in the liver.  Several enzymes are involved.  These include [[cytochrome P450]] 2E1 (CYP2E1), quinine oxidoreductase (NQ01 or DT-diaphorase or [[NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone 1)]]), GSH, and myeloperoxidase (MPO).  CYP2E1 is involved at multiple steps: converting benzene to [[oxepin]] (benzene oxide), [[phenol]] to [[hydroquinone]], and hydroquinone to both benzenetriol and [[catechol]].  Hydroquinone, benzenetriol and catechol are converted to polyphenols.  In the bone marrow, MPO converts these polyphenols to benzoquinones.  These intermediates and metabolites induce genotoxicity by multiple mechanisms including inhibition of topoisomerase II (which maintains chromosome structure), disruption of microtubules (which maintains cellular structure and organization), generation of oxygen free radicals (unstable species) that may lead to point mutations, increasing oxidative stress, inducing DNA strand breaks, and altering DNA methylation (which can affect gene expression).  NQ01 and GSH shift metabolism away from toxicity.  NQ01 metabolizes benzoquinone toward polyphenols (counteracting the effect of MPO).  GSH is involved with the formation of phenylmercapturic acid.<ref name=\"Smith 2010 133\u201348\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Snyder|first=R|author2=Hedli, C.C.|title=An overview of benzene metabolism|journal=Environ Health Perspect|year=1996|volume=104|pages=1165\u20131171|pmid=9118888|pmc=1469747|issue=Suppl 6|doi=10.1289/ehp.96104s61165}}</ref>\n\nGenetic polymorphisms in these enzymes may induce loss of function or gain of function.  For example, mutations in CYP2E1 increase activity and result in increased generation of toxic metabolites.  NQ01 mutations result in loss of function and may result in decreased detoxification.  Myeloperoxidase mutations result in loss of function and may result in decreased generation of toxic metabolites.  GSH mutations or deletions result in loss of function and result in decreased detoxification.

The tenth and final consecutive hurricane and the sixth major hurricane of the very active [[2017 Atlantic hurricane season]], Ophelia had non-tropical origins from a decaying cold front on 6 October. Located within a [[Tropical cyclone#Factors|favorable environment]], the storm steadily strengthened over the next two days, drifting north and then southeastwards before becoming a hurricane on 11 October. After becoming a Category 2 hurricane and fluctuating in intensity for a day, Ophelia intensified into a major hurricane on 14 October south of the [[Azores]], brushing the archipelago with high winds and heavy rainfall. Shortly after achieving peak intensity, Ophelia began weakening as it accelerated over progressively colder waters to its northeast towards [[Ireland]] and [[Great Britain]]. Completing an extratropical transition early on 16 October, Ophelia became the second storm of the [[2017\u201318 European windstorm season]]. Early on 17 October, the cyclone crossed the [[North Sea]] and struck [[western Norway]], with wind gusts up to {{convert|70|kph|mph}} in [[Rogaland|Rogaland county]], before weakening during the evening of 17 October.

The tenth and final consecutive hurricane and the sixth major hurricane of the very active [[2017 Atlantic hurricane season]], Ophelia had non-tropical origins from a decaying cold front on 6 October. Located within a [[Tropical cyclone#Factors|favorable environment]], the storm steadily strengthened over the next two days, drifting north and then southeastwards before becoming a hurricane on 11 October. After becoming a Category 2 hurricane and fluctuating in intensity for a day, Ophelia intensified into a major hurricane on 14 October south of the [[Azores]], brushing the archipelago with high winds and heavy rainfall. Shortly after achieving peak intensity, Ophelia began weakening as it accelerated over progressively colder waters to its northeast towards [[Ireland]] and [[Great Britain]]. Completing an extratropical transition early on 16 October, Ophelia became the second storm of the [[2017\u201318 European windstorm season]]. Early on 17 October, the cyclone crossed the [[North Sea]] and struck [[western Norway]], with wind gusts up to {{convert|70|kph|mph}} in [[Rogaland|Rogaland county]], before weakening during the evening of 17 October. The system then moved across [[Scandinavia]], before dissipating over [[Norway]] on the next day.\n\nThree deaths can be directly attributed to Ophelia, all of which occurred in Ireland. Total losses from the storm were less than initially feared, with a minimum estimate of total insured losses across Ireland and the United Kingdom of US$87.7&nbsp;million.\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|Ophelia 2017 track.png}}\nOn 3 October, a broad [[low-pressure area]] had formed along a [[stationary front]] about {{convert|460|mi|km|abbr=on|round=5}} west of the [[Azores]].
