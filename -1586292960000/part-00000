The station is affectionately referred to as 'Chi' by locals.\n\nThe station was used by approximately 390,000 passengers in 2017-18.\n\nThe [[Tyne and Wear Metro|Tyne & Wear Metro]] station at Chichester was opened in March 1984, and completed the initial [[Tyne and Wear Metro|Metro]] network. It was originally a station on the Green Line from [[Bank Foot Metro station|Bank Foot]] (until 1991), and later, [[Airport Metro station (Tyne and Wear)|Airport]]. Since 2005, the station has been on the Yellow Line from [[St James Metro station|St. James]].\n\nA statue of [[Queen Victoria]] had been moved to Chichester in 1949, from its original position in front of [[South Shields]] Town Hall.<ref>[http://www.journallive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-news/2010/10/18/south-shields-town-hall-reaches-its-century-61634-27493895/]</ref> In 1981, it was removed to make way for the new [[Tyne and Wear Metro|Metro]] station at Chichester, and returned to its original position at the front of the Town Hall, where it remains today.\n\nChichester is situated on the former [[Stanhope and Tyne Railway|Stanhope & Tyne Railway]] route, rather than the former [[Brandling Junction Railway]] route via High Shields.\n\nPart of this line had been transferred into [[National Coal Board]] ownership, and to the south of the station was a single-track electrified freight line, part of the Harton Colliery system.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Vintage Electric|first=Michael|last=Rhodes|pages=22\u201324|issue=83|date=August 1988|magazine=[[RAIL (magazine)|RAIL]]|publisher=EMAP National Publications|issn=0953-4563|oclc=49953699}}</ref> In the early 1990s, this line was de-electrified, and following the closure of Westoe Colliery in 1993, has been closed completely.\n\nThe former colliery line along Chichester Road was regenerated in the late 1990s, being replaced with a supermarket. The line itself was also the spot of the [[Westoe Netty]], an open air public urinal which was depicted in a famous 1972 painting by Bob Olley.<ref>[https://www.shieldsgazette.com/news/celebrated-artist-robert-olley-condemns-fake-copies-of-famous-works-383894]</ref> These toilets were saved when the colliery line was demolished, and are now preserved at the [[Beamish Museum|Beamish Open Air Museum]] in County Durham.\n\nChichester was intended as one of the original interchange stations, which meant buses were timetabled to interchange with [[Tyne and Wear Metro|Metro]] services.  This arrangement broke down after the deregulation of local bus services in 1986.

The station is affectionately referred to as 'Chi' by locals.\n\nThe station was used by approximately 390,000 passengers in 2017-18.\n\nThe [[Tyne and Wear Metro|Tyne & Wear Metro]] station at Chichester was opened in March 1984, and completed the initial [[Tyne and Wear Metro|Metro]] network. It was originally a station on the Green Line from [[Bank Foot Metro station|Bank Foot]] (until 1991), and later, [[Airport Metro station (Tyne and Wear)|Airport]]. Since 2005, the station has been on the Yellow Line from [[St James Metro station|St. James]].\n\nA statue of [[Queen Victoria]] had been moved to Chichester in 1949, from its original position in front of [[South Shields]] Town Hall.<ref>[http://www.journallive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-news/2010/10/18/south-shields-town-hall-reaches-its-century-61634-27493895/]</ref> In 1981, it was removed to make way for the new [[Tyne and Wear Metro|Metro]] station at Chichester, and returned to its original position at the front of the Town Hall, where it remains today.\n\nChichester is situated on the former [[Stanhope and Tyne Railway|Stanhope & Tyne Railway]] route, rather than the former [[Brandling Junction Railway]] route via High Shields.\n\nPart of this line had been transferred into [[National Coal Board]] ownership, and to the south of the station was a single-track electrified freight line, part of the Harton Colliery system.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Vintage Electric|first=Michael|last=Rhodes|pages=22\u201324|issue=83|date=August 1988|magazine=[[RAIL (magazine)|RAIL]]|publisher=EMAP National Publications|issn=0953-4563|oclc=49953699}}</ref> In the early 1990s, this line was de-electrified, and following the closure of Westoe Colliery in 1993, has been closed completely.\n\nThe former colliery line along Chichester Road was regenerated in the late 1990s, being replaced with a supermarket. The line itself was also the spot of the [[Westoe Netty]], an open air public urinal which was depicted in a famous 1972 painting by Bob Olley.<ref>[https://www.shieldsgazette.com/news/celebrated-artist-robert-olley-condemns-fake-copies-of-famous-works-383894]</ref> These toilets were saved when the colliery line was demolished, and are now preserved at the [[Beamish Museum|Beamish Open Air Museum]] in County Durham.\n\nChichester was intended as one of the original interchange stations, which meant buses were timetabled to interchange with [[Tyne and Wear Metro|Metro]] services.  This arrangement broke down after the deregulation of local bus services in 1986. Today, Chichester still serves as one of the [[Tyne and Wear Metro|Metro]]'s main bus interchanges, due to the close proximity of the [[Stagecoach North East|Stagecoach]] bus depot,  but now serves mainly for nearby residential areas, as well as the [[South Tyneside College]] campus.\n\nThe platforms at Chichester are below street level, however the ticket hall is at ground level.

(British game show)|same-titled British program]] and developed for the United States by [[Michael Davies (television producer)|Michael Davies]]. The show features a [[quiz]] competition in which contestants attempt to win a top prize of $1,000,000 by answering a series of multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty (although, for a time, most of the questions were of random difficulty). The program endured as one of the longest-running and most successful international variants in the ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' franchise, running continuously in some form from 1999 until 2019.\n\nThe original U.S. version premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on August 16, 1999 as part of a two-week daily special event hosted by [[Regis Philbin]]. After this and a second two-week event aired in November 1999, ABC commissioned a regular series that launched on January 18, 2000 and ran until June 27, 2002. Philbin hosted the entire run of the original network series as well as three additional special event series that aired on ABC in 2004 and 2009. \n\nA daily version of ''Millionaire'' produced for [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] began airing on September 16, 2002, and was initially hosted by [[Meredith Vieira]]. [[Cedric the Entertainer]] took over the show in 2013 following Vieira's departure, with [[Terry Crews]] replacing him in 2014. The syndicated series' final host was [[Chris Harrison]], who took over from Crews in 2015 and hosted until the show was ultimately cancelled, with the finale airing on May 31, 2019.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-canceled-1203217602/ |title=\u2018Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\u2019 to End After 17 Years in Syndication (Exclusive)|magazine=Variety.com|last=Otterson|first=Joe|date=May 17, 2019|accessdate=June 27, 2019}}</ref> \nOn January 8, 2020, seven months after the cancellation was announced, ABC renewed the show for a twenty-first season (consisting of eight episodes) that would be hosted by [[Jimmy Kimmel]] and feature celebrity contestants; the twenty-first season is expected to premiere on April 8, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/jimmy-kimmel-host-celebrity-driven-who-wants-be-a-millionaire-abc-1268004|title=Jimmy Kimmel to Host Celebrity-Driven 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' for ABC|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 8, 2020|accessdate=January 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAs the first U.S. network game show to offer a million-dollar top prize, the show made television history by becoming one of the highest-rated game shows in the history of American television.

If at any time the contestant gives a wrong answer, the game is over and the contestant's winnings are reduced (or increased, in the first two questions) to $1,000 for tier-one questions, $5,000 for tier-two questions, and $50,000 for tier-three questions. However, the contestant may choose to stop playing after being presented with a question, allowing them to keep all the money they have won to that point.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/> With the exception of the shuffle format, upon correctly answering questions five and ten, contestants are guaranteed at least the amount of prize money associated with that level. If the contestant gives an incorrect answer, their winnings drop down to the last milestone achieved. Since 2015, if the contestant answers a question incorrectly before reaching question five, he or she leaves with $1,000, even on the first question that is worth only $500. For celebrities, the minimum guarantee for their nominated charities is $10,000. Prior to the shuffle format, a contestant left with nothing if they answered a question incorrectly before reaching the first milestone. In the shuffle format, contestants who incorrectly answered a question had their winnings reduced to $1,000 in round one and $25,000 in round two.<ref name=\"Millionaire Facebook\u20142010 changes\">{{cite press release|url= https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/network-press-releases/syndicated-who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-premieres-new-season-september-13/|title=Syndicated ''Who Wants To Be A Millionaire'' Premieres New Season September 13|author= Disney-ABC Domestic Television|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]|publisher=Zap2it|date=August 16, 2010|accessdate=December 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Format history ===\n==== Original format (1999\u20132008) ====\nFrom 1999 to 2002, 10 contestants played a round of Fastest Finger to determine who would play in the hot seat. The participants would be confronted with one question and four answers, and they would have to set the four answers in the correct order (ascending, chronological, etc.) in the fastest time. The competitor who did so correctly in the fastest time would play. If nobody got the correct order, the round was played again, and when a tie breaker occurred, the remaining participants answered a second Fastest Finger question. This round was removed when the syndicated version began in 2002, though it returned in 2004 for Super Millionaire and in 2009 for the 10th Anniversary shows. The format remained unchanged, except for changes to the money staircase and the addition of a new lifeline, until 2008.\n\n====Clock format (2008\u20132010)====\nIn 2008, the format was altered to include a time limit on each question. The amount of time for each question was as follows:\n* Questions 1\u20135 '''($500-$5,000):''' 15 seconds\n* Questions 6\u201310 '''($7,500-$25,000):''' 30 seconds\n* Questions 11\u201314 '''($50,000-$500,000):''' 45 seconds\n* Question 15 '''($1,000,000 question):''' 45 seconds, plus the total of all unused time from the previous 14 questions\n\nThe timer began to run as soon as the four answer options were revealed, and the contestant had to give a final answer before it reached 0. \n\nIf time ran out, the game ended and the contestant left with whatever money they had won to that point. If this happened while the Double Dip lifeline was in effect, the contestant's winnings were instead reduced to the last safe haven they had reached.\n\nWhile the clock format was in use, the contestant was shown the categories of all 15 questions in the order they would be asked.\n\n====Shuffle format (2010\u20132015)====\nThe format was overhauled in September 2010, splitting the game into two rounds. The first round consisted of 10 questions, each in a different category and worth a different amount from $100 to $25,000. Both the category order and the amounts were randomized at the start of the game, with the latter hidden from the contestant's view. The difficulty level and value of each question were not tied to one another. The value of each question was revealed only after the contestant answered it correctly or chose to \"jump\" (skip) it; a correct answer added the money to the contestant's bank, while a jump put the value out of play. The maximum bank from this round was $68,600. If the contestant missed a question in the first round, they left with $1,000, even if their bank was lower than this total. Choosing to stop allowed the contestant to keep half their bank.\n\nThe second round presented four questions of increasing difficulty in the traditional format, each of which augmented the contestant's total winnings to a set value. A miss in this round reduced their winnings to $25,000. Categories for these questions were not given ahead of time.\n\nFrom 2011\u20132014, some weeks were \"Double Your Money\" weeks, in which one first-round question was randomly designated as being worth double value. The maximum potential bank from this round thus became $93,600.\n\n====Final format (2015\u20132019)====\nWith the hiring of new host Chris Harrison, the format was changed once again to resemble that of the original ''Millionaire''. Each contestant faces 14 general-knowledge questions of increasing difficulty, with no time limit or information about the categories.

Multiple lifelines may be used on a single question, but each one can only be used once per game (unless otherwise noted below). Three lifelines are available from the start of the game. Depending on the format of the show, additional lifelines may become available after the contestant correctly answers the fifth or tenth question. In the clock format, usage of lifelines temporarily pauses the clock while the lifelines are played.\n*'''+1''' (2014\u20132019): The contestant may invite a friend onstage from the audience to assist with the current question. After the question result, the friend must return to the audience.\n*'''50:50''' (1999\u20132008, 2015\u20132019): Two incorrect answers are eliminated, leaving the contestant with a choice between the correct answer and one remaining incorrect answer.\n*'''Ask the Audience''' (1999\u20132019): The audience members individually use four-button keypads to register the answer they believe is correct. The percentage of votes for each answer is immediately shown to the host, contestant, and home viewer. Beginning in 2004 and ending a few years later, [[AOL Instant Messenger]] users who added the screen name MillionaireIM to their buddy list and were online were able to receive and register answers they believed to be correct to Ask the Audience questions in real-time; these results were then shown as a separate chart to the contestant.<ref>https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/buena-vista-aol-make-millionaire-interactive-74453/</ref> \n*'''Ask the Expert''' (2008\u20132010): Based on Three Wise Men, the lifeline was earned after answering five questions correctly until 2010, when it was given to the contestant immediately following the removal of Phone a Friend. The contestant was connected to an expert via a video call, and the two could discuss the question with no time limit.\n*'''Crystal Ball''' (2012\u20132015): Used occasionally during the \"shuffle\" round, this lifeline allowed the contestant to see the value of the current question before either answering or jumping it (if Jump the Question had not yet been used).\n*'''Double Dip''' (2004, 2008\u20132010): First used during ''Super Millionaire'', this lifeline allowed a contestant to make a second guess at the answer if his/her first one was wrong. The contestant had to invoke the lifeline before making the first guess, and it was removed from play regardless of which guess was correct. In addition, the contestant could not walk away from the question after invoking the lifeline. It was introduced to the main series in 2008, replacing 50:50.\n*'''Jump the Question''' (2010\u20132015): This lifeline allowed the contestant to skip the current question, but the money associated with it was removed from play. It could be used twice per game from 2010\u20132014, but only once from 2014\u20132015.\n*'''Phone a Friend''' (1999\u20132010): The contestant called a pre-arranged friend and was then given 30 seconds to discuss the question with that person. In 2010, this lifeline was eliminated due to an increasing use of search engines by home viewers to look up answers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McGee |first1=Matt |title=How Google Killed \"Phone A Friend\" From \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?\" |url=https://searchengineland.com/how-google-killed-phone-a-friend-52624 |website=Search Engine Land |accessdate=26 January 2019}}</ref>\n*'''Switch/Cut the Question''' (2004\u20132008): Earned after answering 10 questions, this lifeline allowed a contestant to discard the current question and replace it with one of the same value. It has been used occasionally during Whiz Kids Week in the current version and is available from the outset.\n*'''Three Wise Men''' (2004): Used during ''Super Millionaire'', this lifeline allowed the contestant 30 seconds of advice from a panel of three experts, who were sequestered backstage and saw the question only when their help was requested.\n\n===Top prize winners===\nOver the course of the program's history, twelve people answered the final question correctly and walked away with the top prize:  \n*[[John Carpenter (game show contestant)|John Carpenter]] \u2013 Became the first winner of the top prize on November 19, 1999.<ref>{{cite news|title=Taxman scoops a million|work=BBC News|date=November 21, 1999 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/529186.stm|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref><ref name=PeopleMillionaires>{{cite magazine |url=http://people.com/archive/millionaire-makeovers-vol-54-no-20/|title=Millionaire Makeovers!|work=People|publisher=Time Inc.|volume=54 |number=20|date=November 13, 2000|accessdate=July 8, 2015}}</ref>\n*Dan Blonsky \u2013 Won on January 18, 2000.<ref name=PeopleMillionaires/>\n*Joe Trela \u2013 Won on  March 23, 2000.<ref name=PeopleMillionaires/>\n*Bob House \u2013 Won on June 13, 2000.<ref name=PeopleMillionaires/>\n*Kim Hunt \u2013 Won on July 6, 2000.<ref name=PeopleMillionaires/>\n*David Goodman \u2013 Won on July 11, 2000.<ref name=PeopleMillionaires/>\n*Kevin Olmstead \u2013 Won the top prize on April 10, 2001; however, because of the jackpot having been set to increase by $10,000 each episode, he won $2,180,000 \u2013 making him the biggest winner in television history at the time.<ref name=Jackpot>{{cite news|title=Double jackpot winner on US Millionaire|work=BBC News|date=April 11, 2001 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1271553.stm|accessdate=July 29, 2014}}</ref>\n*Bernie Cullen \u2013 Won the top prize just five days after Olmstead's win on April 15, 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2001/04/16/improbably-millionaire-strikes-again/ |title=Improbably, ''Millionaire'' Strikes Again|work=[[New York Post]]|last=Kaplan|first=Don|date=April 16, 2001|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref>\n*Ed Toutant \u2013 Won on September 7, 2001.

Having earlier created ''[[Debt (game show)|Debt]]'' for [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime Television]] and participated with Al Burton and Donnie Brainard in the creation of ''[[Win Ben Stein's Money]]'' for [[Comedy Central]],<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> Davies decided to create a primetime game show that would save the network from collapse and revive interest in game shows.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nDavies originally considered reviving [[CBS]]'s long-lost quiz show ''[[The $64,000 Question]]'', with a new home on ABC.<ref>{{cite book|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: The Official Book from the Hit TV Show|last1=Davies|first1=Michael|year=2000|publisher=Hyperion Books|isbn=9780786885770|page=[https://archive.org/details/whowantstobemill00fish/page/14 14]|url=https://archive.org/details/whowantstobemill00fish/page/14}}</ref> However, this effort's development was limited as when the producer heard that the British ''Millionaire'' was about to make its debut, he got his friends and family members in the UK to record the show, and subsequently ended up receiving about eight [[FedEx]] packages from different family members, each containing a copy of ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first episode. Davies was so captivated by everything that he had seen and heard, from host [[Chris Tarrant]]'s intimate involvement with the contestant to the show's lighting system and music tracks, that he chose to abandon his work on the ''$64,000 Question'' revival in favor of introducing ''Millionaire'' to American airwaves, convinced that it would become extraordinarily popular.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nWhen Davies presented his ideas for the U.S. ''Millionaire'' to ABC, the network's executives initially rejected them, so he resigned his position there and became an independent producer.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> Determined to bring his idea for the show to fruition, Davies decided that he was betting his whole career on ''Millionaire''{{'}}s production, and the first move that he made was planning to attach a celebrity host to the show. Along with Philbin, a number of other popular television personalities were considered for hosting positions on the U.S. ''Millionaire'' during its development, including [[Peter Jennings]],<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> [[Bob Costas]], [[Phil Donahue]], and [[Montel Williams]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=msDfDRx6OK4C&pg=PA147&lpg=PA147&dq=Bob+Costas,+Phil+Donahue,+and+Montel+Williams,&source=bl&ots=vhUiVfMMVj&sig=ZbvvC89-UDTTvoO46tsqQS3lq98&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwje_J3qgffYAhWNyVMKHQl9AIEQ6AEIPDAH#v=onepage&q=Bob%20Costas%2C%20Phil%20Donahue%2C%20and%20Montel%20Williams%2C&f=false|title=Regis!: The Unauthorized Biography|last=Tracy|first=Kathleen|publisher=ECW Press|page=147|isbn=9781550224399|year=2000}}</ref> but among those considered, it was Philbin who wanted the job the most, and when he saw an episode of the British ''Millionaire'' and was blown away by his content, Davies and his team ultimately settled on having him host the American show.<ref name=\"Furman & Furman\"/> When Davies approached ABC again after having hired Philbin, the network finally agreed to accept the U.S. ''Millionaire''.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> With production now ready to begin, the team had only five months to finish developing the show and get it launched, with Davies demanding perfection in every element of ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s production.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\n===Audition process===\nWith few exceptions, any legal resident of the United States who was 18 years of age or older had the potential of becoming a contestant through ''Millionaire''{{'}}s audition process. Those ineligible included employees, immediate family or household members, and close acquaintances of SPE, Disney, or any of their respective affiliates or subsidiaries; television stations that broadcast the syndicated version; or any advertising agency or other firm or entity engaged in the production, administration, or judging of the show. Also ineligible were candidates for political office and individuals who had appeared on a different game show outside of cable that had been broadcast within the past year, was intended to be broadcast within the next year, or had played the main game on any of the U.S. versions of ''Millionaire'' itself.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/>\n\nPotential contestants of the original primetime version had to compete in a telephone contest which had them dial a toll-free number and answer three questions by putting objects or events in order. Callers had ten seconds to enter the order on a keypad, with any incorrect answer ending the game/call. The 10,000 to 20,000 candidates who answered all three questions correctly were selected into a random drawing in which approximately 300 contestants competed for ten spots on the show using the same phone quiz method.{{refn|To qualify for 2004's ''Super Millionaire'' spin-off, potential contestants were required to answer five questions. Each person who successfully answered all five questions chose one tape date, and the contestants for that tape date were drawn from that pool.|group=note}} Accommodations for contestants outside the New York City area included round trip airfare (or other transportation) and hotel accommodations.\n\nThe syndicated version's potential contestants, depending on tryouts, were required to pass an electronically scored test<ref name=\"About.com\">{{cite web|url=http://gameshows.about.com/od/beacontestant/a/wwtbamauditions.htm |title=Be a Contestant on Who Wants to be a Millionaire |last=Grosvenor |first=Carrie |publisher=about.com |accessdate=August 13, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113020940/http://gameshows.about.com/od/beacontestant/a/wwtbamauditions.htm |archivedate=November 13, 2016 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> comprising a set of thirty questions which had to be answered within a 10-minute time limit. Contestants who failed the test were eliminated, while those who passed were interviewed for an audition by the production staff,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.seattletimes.com/html/television/2003638513_tvgameshowaudition28.html|title=Who wants to be a game-show contestant?|first=Claudia|last=Perry|date=March 28, 2007|work=The Seattle Times|accessdate=July 16, 2010}}</ref> and those who impressed the staff the most were then notified by postal mail that they had been placed into a pool for possible selection as contestants. At the producers' discretion, contestants from said pool were selected to appear on actual episodes of the syndicated program; these contestants were given a phone call from staff and asked to confirm the information on their initial application form and verify that they met all eligibility requirements. Afterwards, they were given a date to travel to the show's taping facilities to participate in a scheduled episode of the show.<ref name=\"About.com\"/> Unlike its ABC counterpart, the syndicated version did not offer transportation or hotel accommodations to contestants at the production company's expense; that version's contestants were instead required to provide transportation and accommodations of their own.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/>\n\nThe syndicated ''Millionaire'' also conducts open casting calls in various locations across the United States to search for potential contestants. These are held in late spring or early summer, with all dates and locations posted on the show's official website. The producers make no guarantee on how many applicants will be tested at each particular venue;<ref name=\"About.com\"/> however, the show will not test any more than 2,500 individuals per audition day.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/>\n\nIn cases when the show features themed episodes with two people playing as a team, auditions for these episodes' contestants are announced on the show's website. Both members of the team must pass the written test and the audition interview successfully in order to be considered for selection. If only one member of the team passes, he or she is placed into the contestant pool alone and must continue the audition process as an individual in order to proceed.<ref name=\"About.com\"/>\n\n===Music===\nOriginally, the U.S. ''Millionaire'' carried over the musical score from the British version, composed by father-and-son duo [[Keith Strachan|Keith]] and [[Matthew Strachan]]. Unlike older game show musical scores, ''Millionaire''{{'}}s musical score was created to feature music playing almost throughout the entire show. The Strachans' main ''Millionaire'' [[theme song]] took some inspiration from the \"Mars\" movement of [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'',<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\">{{cite news|title=Million Pound Notes: Keith Strachan|last=Smurthwaite|first=Nick|newspaper=[[The Stage]]|date=March 21, 2005|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612081217/http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991|archivedate=June 12, 2011}}</ref> and their question cues from the $2,000 to the $32,000/$25,000 level, and then from the $64,000/$50,000 to $500,000 level, took the pitch up a semitone for each subsequent question, in order to increase tension as the contestant progressed through the game.<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\"/> On GSN's ''Gameshow Hall of Fame'' special, the narrator described the Strachan tracks as \"mimicking the sound of a beating heart\", and stated that as the contestant worked their way up the money ladder, the music was \"perfectly in tune with their ever-increasing pulse\".<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nThe original ''Millionaire'' musical score holds the distinction of being the only game show soundtrack to be acknowledged by the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]], as the Strachans were honored with numerous ASCAP awards for their work, the earliest of them awarded in 2000.<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\"/> The original music cues were given minor rearrangements for the clock format in 2008; for example, the question cues were synced to the \"ticking\" sounds of the game clock. Even later, the Strachan score was removed from the U.S. version altogether for the introduction of the shuffle format in 2010, in favor of a new musical score with cues written by Jeff Lippencott and Mark T. Williams, co-founders of the Los Angeles-based company [[Ah2 Music]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Ah2 Music Marks 10th Anniversary|url=http://www.trailermusicvibe.com/ah2-music-marks-10th-anniversary/|publisher=TrailerMusicVibe|date=August 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Set===\nThe U.S. ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s basic set was a direct adaptation of the British version's set design, which was conceived by [[Andy Walmsley]]. Paul Smith's original licensing agreement for the U.S. ''Millionaire'' required that the show's set design, along with all other elements of the show's on-air presentation (musical score, lighting system, host's wardrobe, etc.), adhere faithfully to the way in which they were presented in the British version; this same licensing agreement applied to all other international versions of the show, making Walmsley's ''Millionaire'' set design the most reproduced scenic design in television history.<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/> The original version of the U.S. ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s set cost $200,000 to construct.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The U.S. ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Production designer|production design]] was handled at different times by David Weller, Jim Fenhagen and George Allison.<ref name=\"Production credits\"/>\n\nUnlike older game shows whose sets are or were designed to make the contestant(s) feel at ease, ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s set was designed to make the contestant feel uncomfortable, so that the program feels more like a movie thriller than a typical quiz show.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The floor is made of [[Plexiglas]]<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/> beneath which lies a huge dish covered in mirror paper.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> Before the shuffle format was implemented in 2010, the main game had the contestant and host sit in chairs in the center of the stage, known as \"Hot Seats\"; these measured {{convert|3|ft|m}} high, were modeled after chairs typically found in [[hair salon]]s,<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> and each seat featured a computer monitor directly facing it to display questions and other pertinent information. Shortly after the shuffle format was introduced to ''Millionaire'', Vieira stated in an interview with her ''Millionaire'' predecessor on [[Live with Kelly and Michael|his morning talk show]] that the Hot Seat was removed because it was decided that the seat, which was originally intended to make the contestant feel nervous, actually ended up having contestants feel so comfortable in it that it did not service the production team any longer.<ref name=\"Regis and Kelly\">{{Cite episode|title=Season 23, Episode 8|series=Live! with Regis and Kelly|airdate=September 15, 2010|network=Syndicated|credits=Disney-ABC Domestic Television}}</ref>\n\nThe lighting system was programmed to darken the set as the contestant progressed further into the game. There were also spotlights situated at the bottom of the set area that zoomed down on the contestant when they answered a major question; to increase the visibility of the light beams emitted by such spotlights, oil was vaporized, creating a haze effect.

Despite the ratings struggles of the network edition, there was still enough interest in ''Millionaire'' as a series that enough stations signed on for a fall 2002 launch; the original idea for the syndicated series to serve as an accompaniment to the network series did not come to fruition, as intended, due to ABC's decision to cancel ''Millionaire''.<ref name=\"weekday millionaire\"/><ref name=\"tvseriesfinale.com\"/> \n\nOn September 16, 2002, nearly three months after the network ''Millionaire'' ended its run, the syndicated series premiered. Right away, it found itself having similar ratings issues. Some stations began to look for other options to place in the slots where they had initially plugged ''Millionaire''; this included several larger market stations, especially their largest market affiliate, and thus ''Millionaire'' was looking at a second cancellation notice in less than a year. As fate would have it, though, this turn of events happened to coincide with a significant one going on at two of BVT's corporate siblings.\n\nWhen BVT initially sold ''Millionaire'' into syndication, the largest market station to come on board was [[WCBS-TV]] in New York, the flagship of the [[CBS]] network. Looking to bolster its offerings in the two hours between the end of CBS' daytime schedule and its first evening newscast of the day, which had been an ongoing problem for the station for years, ''Millionaire'' was one of two major additions to WCBS' lineup for the 2002\u20132003 season. The station gave it the 4 pm weekday timeslot that had housed ''[[Weakest Link (American game show)|Weakest Link]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/20/arts/tv-notes-games-to-clash-on-syndication.html|title=TV Notes: Games to Clash on Syndication|work=The New York Times|last=Carter|first=Bill|date=June 20, 2001|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref> <ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://adage.com/article/special-report-hoagtest01/dr-phil-millionaire-john-walsh-arrive-heat-factor-lacking/52202/|title='Dr. Phil,' 'Millionaire,' 'John Walsh' arrive, but heat factor is lacking|magazine=Advertising Age|last=Pendleton|first=Jennifer|date=May 13, 2002|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref> a syndicated version of another network primetime quiz show (in this case, produced by NBC) that had launched in January 2002.\n\nThe timeslot, at the time, was a fairly competitive one. [[WABC-TV]] had been airing ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', which had consistently been the most popular daytime talk show, there since September 1986. [[WNBC]] at the time carried ''[[Judge Judy]]'', which was the second-highest rated program in daytime syndication behind ''Oprah''. ''Millionaire'' was unable to cut into the audience for either program, despite having the other major WCBS acquisition, the talk show ''[[Dr. Phil (talk show)|Dr. Phil]]'', as its lead in. WCBS again decided to switch its lineup.\n\nIn April 2003, with the season in its final weeks, WCBS announced its addition of ''[[The People's Court]]'' to its lineup for fall 2003 after the revived series had aired since its 1997 debut on WNBC.<ref name=\"Millionaire Poorer\"/> WCBS announced that ''The People's Court'' would be airing at 4:00 pm once it joined the station's lineup, which meant that ''Millionaire'' would be forced out of the timeslot after one year. BVT tried to negotiate with WCBS for another timeslot but the station had other obligations and thus could not accommodate them. There was not much in the way of open time slots on any of the other New York stations either, as they had other obligations in daytime and nighttime fringe slots, and BVT was in a position that could have seen ''Millionaire'' be reduced to airing in a post-midnight period or another non-traditional time that syndicators try to avoid. <ref name=\"Millionaire Poorer\">{{Cite news|url=http://business.highbeam.com/2012/article-1G1-95355049/millionaire-poorer-ny-game-loses-wcbs-plum-4-pm-slot|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808042435/http://business.highbeam.com/2012/article-1G1-95355049/millionaire-poorer-ny-game-loses-wcbs-plum-4-pm-slot|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 8, 2014|title=''Millionaire'' poorer in N.Y.|url-access=subscription |work=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Highbeam Business|date=December 2, 2002|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref> <ref name=\"Millionaire Poorer\"/> \n\nMeanwhile, ABC was about to shake up its daytime schedule in a move made shortly after ''Millionaire'' concluded its season. The network had long programmed a thirty-minute serial at 12:30 pm, and since 1997 that time slot had belonged to ''[[Port Charles]]''. In July 2003, however, the network decided that it would be discontinuing the program after its contract to air it expired in October and, once that happened, the timeslot ''Port Charles'' had occupied would be given back to the affiliates to program as they wished. BVT decided to go to its parent company's flagship station and offered ''Millionaire'' to WABC as the replacement for ''Port Charles'', and the two sides agreed. Beginning in September 2003, ''Millionaire'' joined WABC's lineup and remained part of the station's lineup for the rest of its run.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/television/brief_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1967240|title=''Millionaire'' nabs key slots in syndication|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=September 2, 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030907080505/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/television/brief_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1967240|archivedate=September 7, 2003}}</ref> ABC was impressed enough with the ratings improvement that the network, with one or two exceptions ([[WLS-TV]] in Chicago and [[KABC-TV]] in Los Angeles, though the latter would eventually add the series) picked up ''Millionaire'' for the other stations it owned.\n\nFollowing the 2014\u201315 season, ''Millionaire'' nearly was cancelled after a disagreement with BVT's successor, Disney-ABC Domestic Television, and [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]], the owner of the  format rights through its subsidiary [[2waytraffic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://millionairetv.dadt.com/local-listings/|title=Local Listings|publisher=Millionaire TV|accessdate=August 20, 2014}}</ref> According to e-mails released in the [[Sony Pictures Entertainment hack]], ''Millionaire'''s declining ratings prompted DADT to demand a dramatically reduced licensing fee for renewal, which SPE was hesitant to accept. The two sides eventually agreed on terms for renewal, which included a return to the original question format (but with fourteen questions) and cuts to the production budget, which resulted in the series leaving New York for [[Stamford, Connecticut]] (although this had been done in 2014) and later moving to [[Las Vegas]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Anotado|first=Cory|url=http://www.buzzerblog.com/2015/06/29/millionaire-re-introduces-ladder-format-for-2015-season/|title=Millionaire re-introduces ladder format for 2015 season|work=Buzzerblog|date=June 29, 2015|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}</ref> Had the show not been renewed, SPE was going to place the show on extended hiatus for three years, after which it would reclaim full rights to the show and be free to shop the revived show to another network or syndicator.

With a time of 4:39 (45 seconds + 3:54 banked time), Basin was given a question involving President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Baines Johnson]]'s fondness for [[Fresca]]. Using his one remaining lifeline, Basin asked the audience, which supported his own hunch of [[Yoo-hoo]] rather than the correct answer. He decided to answer the question and lost $475,000, becoming the first contestant in the U.S. version to answer a $1,000,000 question incorrectly.

Deciding that six-plus years had been too long since someone had won the top prize, producers conducted a tournament to find a third million dollar winner.<ref>{{Cite episode|season=8|number=1|series=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire|network=Syndicated|date=September 7, 2009}}</ref> For the first nine weeks of the 2009\u201310 season, each episode saw contestants attempt to qualify for what was referred to as the \"Tournament of Ten\". Contestants were seeded based on how much money they had won, with the biggest winner ranked first and the lowest ranked tenth. Ties were broken based on how much time a contestant had banked when they had walked away from the game.<ref name=\"Tournament\">{{cite web|url=http://gameshows.about.com/od/millionaireglossary/g/tournament_of_ten.htm |title='Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' Tournament of Ten |publisher=about.com |accessdate=July 16, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113062329/http://gameshows.about.com/od/millionaireglossary/g/tournament_of_ten.htm |archivedate=November 13, 2009 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe tournament began on the episode aired November 9, 2009, and playing in order from the lowest to the highest seed, tournament contestants played one at a time at the end of that episode and the next nine. The rules were exactly the same as they were for a normal million dollar question under the clock format introduced the season before, except here, the contestants had no lifelines at their disposal. Each contestant received a base time of 45 seconds. For each question they had answered before walking away, the contestants received any unused seconds that were left when they gave their answers. The accumulated total of those unused seconds was then added to the base time to give the contestants their final question time limit.<ref name=\"Tournament\"/>\n\nEach contestant had the same decision facing them as before, which was whether to attempt to answer the question or walk away with their pre-tournament total intact. Attempting the question and answering incorrectly incurred the same penalty as in regular play, with a reduction of their pre-tournament winnings to $25,000. If the question was answered correctly, the player that did so became the tournament leader. If another player after him/her answered correctly, that player assumed the lead and the previous leader kept their pre-tournament winnings. The highest remaining seed to have attempted and correctly answered their question at the end of the tournament on November 20, 2009 would be declared the winner and become the syndicated series' third millionaire.<ref name=\"Tournament\"/>\n\nThe first contestant to attempt to answer the million dollar question was Sam Murray, the tournament's eighth-seeded qualifier. On November 11, Murray was asked approximately how many people had lived on Earth in its history and correctly guessed 100 billion. Murray was still atop the leaderboard entering the November 20 finale as he remained the only contestant to even attempt to answer his or her question. The only person who could defeat him was top seed and $250,000 winner Jehan Shamsid-Deen, who was asked a question regarding the [[Blorenge]], cited as \"a rare example of a word that rhymes with orange\". Shamsid-Deen considered taking the risk, believing (correctly) that the name belonged to a mountain in [[Wales]]. However, she decided that the potential of losing $225,000 did not justify the risk and elected to walk away from the question, giving Murray the win and the million dollar prize.<ref name=\"Murray millionaire\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nSince its introduction to the United States, GSN credited ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' with not only single-handedly reviving the game show genre, but also breaking new ground for it.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The series revolutionized the look and feel of game shows with its unique lighting system, dramatic music cues, and futuristic set. The show also became one of the highest-rated and most popular game shows in U.S. television history, and has been credited with paving the way for the rise of the primetime reality TV phenomenon to prominence throughout the 2000s.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/><ref name=\"Far from\"/>\n\nThe U.S. ''Millionaire'' also made catchphrases out of various lines used on the show. In particular, ''\"Is that your final answer?\"'', asked by ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s hosts whenever a contestant's answer needs to be verified, was popularized by Philbin during his tenure as host,<ref name=\"tvseriesfinale.com\"/> and was also included on [[TV Land]]'s special \"100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catch Phrases\", which aired in 2006.<ref>The Star Ledger.

This game featured an altered version of the shuffle format, condensing the number of questions to twelve\u2014eight in round one and four in round two. Contestants competed against eight other ''Millionaire'' fans in round one, with the top three playing round two alone. There was no \"final answer\" rule; the contestant's responses were automatically locked in. Answering a question correctly earned a contestant the value of that question, multiplied by the number of people who responded incorrectly. Contestants were allowed to use two of their Facebook friends as Jump the Question lifelines in round one, and to use the Ask the Audience lifeline in round two to invite up to 50 such friends of theirs to answer a question for a portion of the prize money of the current question.<ref>{{cite web|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire now on Facebook: Compete with others for virtual riches|url=https://www.aol.com/article/2011/04/07/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-now-on-facebook-compete-with-othe/19906686/|last=Shaul|first=Brandy|publisher=AOL|date=April 7, 2011|accessdate=April 2, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404043122/https://www.aol.com/article/2011/04/07/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-now-on-facebook-compete-with-othe/19906686/|archivedate=April 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Album===\nWho Wants to Be a Millionaire: The Album (Celador Records), by [[Keith Strachan]], [[Matthew Strachan]], and various artists, was released August 1, 2000 and features songs based on the show.<ref>{{cite web |title=Keith Strachan & Matthew Strachan \u2013 Who Wants To Be A Millionaire (The Album) |url=https://www.discogs.com/Keith-Strachan-Matthew-Strachan-Who-Wants-To-Be-A-Millionaire-The-Album/release/3958022 |website=Discogs |accessdate=14 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Disney Parks attraction===\n{{Main|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire \u2013 Play It!}}\n[[File:Who Wants to Be a Millionaire - Play It!

Both the Florida and California ''Play It!'' attractions opened in 2001; the California version closed in 2004,<ref>{{cite book|last=Shaffer|first=Joshua C.|title=Discovering the Magic Kingdom: An Unofficial Disneyland Vacation Guide|publisher=Author House|year=2010|page=207|isbn=9781452063133}}</ref> and the Florida version closed in 2006 and was replaced by ''[[Toy Story Midway Mania!]]''\n\nThe format in the ''Play It!'' attraction was very similar to that of the television show that inspired it. When a show started, a Fastest Finger question was given, and the audience was asked to put the four answers in order; the person with the fastest time was the first contestant in the Hot Seat for that show. However, the main game had some differences: for example, contestants competed for points rather than dollars, the questions were set to time limits, and the Phone-a-Friend lifeline became ''Phone a Complete Stranger'' which connected the contestant to a Disney cast member outside the attraction's theater who would find a guest to help.

(British game show)|same-titled British program]] and developed for the United States by [[Michael Davies (television producer)|Michael Davies]]. The show features a [[quiz]] competition in which contestants attempt to win a top prize of $1,000,000 by answering a series of multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty (although, for a time, most of the questions were of random difficulty). The program endured as one of the longest-running and most successful international variants in the ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' franchise, running continuously in some form from 1999 until 2019.\n\nThe original U.S. version premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on August 16, 1999 as part of a two-week daily special event hosted by [[Regis Philbin]]. After this and a second two-week event aired in November 1999, ABC commissioned a regular series that launched on January 18, 2000 and ran until June 27, 2002. Philbin hosted the entire run of the original network series as well as three additional special event series that aired on ABC in 2004 and 2009. \n\nA daily version of ''Millionaire'' produced for [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] began airing on September 16, 2002, and was initially hosted by [[Meredith Vieira]]. [[Cedric the Entertainer]] took over the show in 2013 following Vieira's departure, with [[Terry Crews]] replacing him in 2014. The syndicated series' final host was [[Chris Harrison]], who took over from Crews in 2015 and hosted until the show was ultimately cancelled, with the finale airing on May 31, 2019.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-canceled-1203217602/ |title=\u2018Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\u2019 to End After 17 Years in Syndication (Exclusive)|magazine=Variety.com|last=Otterson|first=Joe|date=May 17, 2019|accessdate=June 27, 2019}}</ref> \nOn January 8, 2020, seven months after the cancellation was announced, ABC renewed the show for a twenty-first season (consisting of eight episodes) that would be hosted by [[Jimmy Kimmel]] and feature celebrity contestants; the twenty-first season is expected to premiere on April 8, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/jimmy-kimmel-host-celebrity-driven-who-wants-be-a-millionaire-abc-1268004|title=Jimmy Kimmel to Host Celebrity-Driven 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' for ABC|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 8, 2020|accessdate=January 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAs the first U.S. network game show to offer a million-dollar top prize, the show made television history by becoming one of the highest-rated game shows in the history of American television. The U.S. ''Millionaire'' won seven [[Daytime Emmy Award]]s, and ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked it No. 6 in its 2013 list of the 60 greatest game shows of all time.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Gameplay==\n===Core rules===\n[[File:Wales on millionaire.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Screenshot illustrating how question text and answer choices appear on-screen]]\nAt its core, the game is a quiz competition in which the goal is to correctly answer a series of fourteen (originally fifteen) consecutive multiple-choice questions.

If at any time the contestant gives a wrong answer, the game is over and the contestant's winnings are reduced (or increased, in the first two questions) to $1,000 for tier-one questions, $5,000 for tier-two questions, and $50,000 for tier-three questions. However, the contestant may choose to stop playing after being presented with a question, allowing them to keep all the money they have won to that point.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/> With the exception of the shuffle format, upon correctly answering questions five and ten, contestants are guaranteed at least the amount of prize money associated with that level. If the contestant gives an incorrect answer, their winnings drop down to the last milestone achieved. Since 2015, if the contestant answers a question incorrectly before reaching question five, he or she leaves with $1,000, even on the first question that is worth only $500. For celebrities, the minimum guarantee for their nominated charities is $10,000. Prior to the shuffle format, a contestant left with nothing if they answered a question incorrectly before reaching the first milestone. In the shuffle format, contestants who incorrectly answered a question had their winnings reduced to $1,000 in round one and $25,000 in round two.<ref name=\"Millionaire Facebook\u20142010 changes\">{{cite press release|url= https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/network-press-releases/syndicated-who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-premieres-new-season-september-13/|title=Syndicated ''Who Wants To Be A Millionaire'' Premieres New Season September 13|author= Disney-ABC Domestic Television|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]|publisher=Zap2it|date=August 16, 2010|accessdate=December 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Format history ===\n==== Original format (1999\u20132008) ====\nFrom 1999 to 2002, 10 contestants played a round of Fastest Finger to determine who would play in the hot seat. The participants would be confronted with one question and four answers, and they would have to set the four answers in the correct order (ascending, chronological, etc.) in the fastest time. The competitor who did so correctly in the fastest time would play. If nobody got the correct order, the round was played again, and when a tie breaker occurred, the remaining participants answered a second Fastest Finger question. This round was removed when the syndicated version began in 2002, though it returned in 2004 for Super Millionaire and in 2009 for the 10th Anniversary shows. The format remained unchanged, except for changes to the money staircase and the addition of a new lifeline, until 2008.\n\n====Clock format (2008\u20132010)====\nIn 2008, the format was altered to include a time limit on each question. The amount of time for each question was as follows:\n* Questions 1\u20135 '''($500-$5,000):''' 15 seconds\n* Questions 6\u201310 '''($7,500-$25,000):''' 30 seconds\n* Questions 11\u201314 '''($50,000-$500,000):''' 45 seconds\n* Question 15 '''($1,000,000 question):''' 45 seconds, plus the total of all unused time from the previous 14 questions\n\nThe timer began to run as soon as the four answer options were revealed, and the contestant had to give a final answer before it reached 0. \n\nIf time ran out, the game ended and the contestant left with whatever money they had won to that point. If this happened while the Double Dip lifeline was in effect, the contestant's winnings were instead reduced to the last safe haven they had reached.\n\nWhile the clock format was in use, the contestant was shown the categories of all 15 questions in the order they would be asked.\n\n====Shuffle format (2010\u20132015)====\nThe format was overhauled in September 2010, splitting the game into two rounds. The first round consisted of 10 questions, each in a different category and worth a different amount from $100 to $25,000. Both the category order and the amounts were randomized at the start of the game, with the latter hidden from the contestant's view. The difficulty level and value of each question were not tied to one another. The value of each question was revealed only after the contestant answered it correctly or chose to \"jump\" (skip) it; a correct answer added the money to the contestant's bank, while a jump put the value out of play. The maximum bank from this round was $68,600. If the contestant missed a question in the first round, they left with $1,000, even if their bank was lower than this total. Choosing to stop allowed the contestant to keep half their bank.\n\nThe second round presented four questions of increasing difficulty in the traditional format, each of which augmented the contestant's total winnings to a set value. A miss in this round reduced their winnings to $25,000. Categories for these questions were not given ahead of time.\n\nFrom 2011\u20132014, some weeks were \"Double Your Money\" weeks, in which one first-round question was randomly designated as being worth double value. The maximum potential bank from this round thus became $93,600.\n\n====Final format (2015\u20132019)====\nWith the hiring of new host Chris Harrison, the format was changed once again to resemble that of the original ''Millionaire''. Each contestant faces 14 general-knowledge questions of increasing difficulty, with no time limit or information about the categories. Beginning in 2017, a contestant who missed any of the first five questions left with $1,000, even if the missed question was of a lower value.\n\n===Payout structure===\nFive different ladders have been used over the course of the series:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:50%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10%;\"|Question<br>number\n!colspan=\"5\"|Question value\n|-\n! style=\"width:18%\"|1999\u20132004, 2020\u2013\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|2004\u201309\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|2009\u201310\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|2010\u201315<ref name=\"Millionaire Facebook\u20142010 changes\"/>\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|2015\u201319\n|-\n|1\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$100\n|$500\n| rowspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|<small>Random values</small><br>$100, $500, $1,000, $2,000, $3,000, $5,000, $7,000, $10,000, $15,000, and $25,000\n|$500\n|-\n|2\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$200\n|$1,000\n|$1,000\n|-\n|3\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$300\n|$2,000\n|$2,000\n|-\n|4\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$500\n|$3,000\n|$3,000\n|-\n|5\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''$1,000'''\n|'''$5,000'''\n|'''$5,000'''\n|-\n|6\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$2,000\n|$7,500\n|$7,000\n|-\n|7\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$4,000\n|$10,000\n|$10,000\n|-\n|8\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$8,000\n|$12,500\n|$20,000\n|-\n|9\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$16,000\n|$15,000\n|$30,000\n|-\n|10\n|'''$32,000'''\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''$25,000'''\n|'''$50,000'''\n|-\n|11\n|$64,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$50,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$100,000\n|-\n|12\n|$125,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$100,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$250,000\n|-\n|13\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$250,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$500,000\n|-\n|14\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|$500,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''$1,000,000'''\n|-\n|15\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''$1,000,000'''\n|  colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#c9cac8;\"|\n|}\n\nThe $500,000 and $1,000,000 prizes were initially lump-sum payments, but were changed to annuities in September 2002 when the series moved to syndication. Contestants winning either of these prizes receive $250,000 thirty days after their show broadcasts and the remainder paid in equal annual payments. The $500,000 prize consists of $25,000 per year for 10 years, while the $1,000,000 prize consists of $37,500 per year for 20 years.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/>\n\nFrom 2017\u20132019, contestants who answered one of the first five questions incorrectly received a $1,000 consolation prize.<ref>{{cite web|title=Who Wants To Be A Millionaire: Official Rules (Archive)|url=http://millionairetv.dadt.com/official-rules/|accessdate=24 July 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629022556/http://millionairetv.dadt.com/official-rules/|archivedate=June 29, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> On the original primetime version and in earlier seasons of the syndicated version prior to 2010, contestants who missed one of the first five questions left with no winnings.\n\n===Lifelines===\nForms of assistance known as \"lifelines\" are available for a contestant to use if a question proves difficult. Multiple lifelines may be used on a single question, but each one can only be used once per game (unless otherwise noted below). Three lifelines are available from the start of the game. Depending on the format of the show, additional lifelines may become available after the contestant correctly answers the fifth or tenth question. In the clock format, usage of lifelines temporarily pauses the clock while the lifelines are played.\n*'''+1''' (2014\u20132019): The contestant may invite a friend onstage from the audience to assist with the current question. After the question result, the friend must return to the audience.\n*'''50:50''' (1999\u20132008, 2015\u20132019): Two incorrect answers are eliminated, leaving the contestant with a choice between the correct answer and one remaining incorrect answer.\n*'''Ask the Audience''' (1999\u20132019): The audience members individually use four-button keypads to register the answer they believe is correct. The percentage of votes for each answer is immediately shown to the host, contestant, and home viewer. Beginning in 2004 and ending a few years later, [[AOL Instant Messenger]] users who added the screen name MillionaireIM to their buddy list and were online were able to receive and register answers they believed to be correct to Ask the Audience questions in real-time; these results were then shown as a separate chart to the contestant.<ref>https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/buena-vista-aol-make-millionaire-interactive-74453/</ref> \n*'''Ask the Expert''' (2008\u20132010): Based on Three Wise Men, the lifeline was earned after answering five questions correctly until 2010, when it was given to the contestant immediately following the removal of Phone a Friend. The contestant was connected to an expert via a video call, and the two could discuss the question with no time limit.\n*'''Crystal Ball''' (2012\u20132015): Used occasionally during the \"shuffle\" round, this lifeline allowed the contestant to see the value of the current question before either answering or jumping it (if Jump the Question had not yet been used).\n*'''Double Dip''' (2004, 2008\u20132010): First used during ''Super Millionaire'', this lifeline allowed a contestant to make a second guess at the answer if his/her first one was wrong. The contestant had to invoke the lifeline before making the first guess, and it was removed from play regardless of which guess was correct. In addition, the contestant could not walk away from the question after invoking the lifeline. It was introduced to the main series in 2008, replacing 50:50.\n*'''Jump the Question''' (2010\u20132015): This lifeline allowed the contestant to skip the current question, but the money associated with it was removed from play.

Having earlier created ''[[Debt (game show)|Debt]]'' for [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime Television]] and participated with Al Burton and Donnie Brainard in the creation of ''[[Win Ben Stein's Money]]'' for [[Comedy Central]],<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> Davies decided to create a primetime game show that would save the network from collapse and revive interest in game shows.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nDavies originally considered reviving [[CBS]]'s long-lost quiz show ''[[The $64,000 Question]]'', with a new home on ABC.<ref>{{cite book|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: The Official Book from the Hit TV Show|last1=Davies|first1=Michael|year=2000|publisher=Hyperion Books|isbn=9780786885770|page=[https://archive.org/details/whowantstobemill00fish/page/14 14]|url=https://archive.org/details/whowantstobemill00fish/page/14}}</ref> However, this effort's development was limited as when the producer heard that the British ''Millionaire'' was about to make its debut, he got his friends and family members in the UK to record the show, and subsequently ended up receiving about eight [[FedEx]] packages from different family members, each containing a copy of ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first episode. Davies was so captivated by everything that he had seen and heard, from host [[Chris Tarrant]]'s intimate involvement with the contestant to the show's lighting system and music tracks, that he chose to abandon his work on the ''$64,000 Question'' revival in favor of introducing ''Millionaire'' to American airwaves, convinced that it would become extraordinarily popular.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nWhen Davies presented his ideas for the U.S. ''Millionaire'' to ABC, the network's executives initially rejected them, so he resigned his position there and became an independent producer.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> Determined to bring his idea for the show to fruition, Davies decided that he was betting his whole career on ''Millionaire''{{'}}s production, and the first move that he made was planning to attach a celebrity host to the show. Along with Philbin, a number of other popular television personalities were considered for hosting positions on the U.S. ''Millionaire'' during its development, including [[Peter Jennings]],<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> [[Bob Costas]], [[Phil Donahue]], and [[Montel Williams]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=msDfDRx6OK4C&pg=PA147&lpg=PA147&dq=Bob+Costas,+Phil+Donahue,+and+Montel+Williams,&source=bl&ots=vhUiVfMMVj&sig=ZbvvC89-UDTTvoO46tsqQS3lq98&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwje_J3qgffYAhWNyVMKHQl9AIEQ6AEIPDAH#v=onepage&q=Bob%20Costas%2C%20Phil%20Donahue%2C%20and%20Montel%20Williams%2C&f=false|title=Regis!: The Unauthorized Biography|last=Tracy|first=Kathleen|publisher=ECW Press|page=147|isbn=9781550224399|year=2000}}</ref> but among those considered, it was Philbin who wanted the job the most, and when he saw an episode of the British ''Millionaire'' and was blown away by his content, Davies and his team ultimately settled on having him host the American show.<ref name=\"Furman & Furman\"/> When Davies approached ABC again after having hired Philbin, the network finally agreed to accept the U.S. ''Millionaire''.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> With production now ready to begin, the team had only five months to finish developing the show and get it launched, with Davies demanding perfection in every element of ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s production.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\n===Audition process===\nWith few exceptions, any legal resident of the United States who was 18 years of age or older had the potential of becoming a contestant through ''Millionaire''{{'}}s audition process. Those ineligible included employees, immediate family or household members, and close acquaintances of SPE, Disney, or any of their respective affiliates or subsidiaries; television stations that broadcast the syndicated version; or any advertising agency or other firm or entity engaged in the production, administration, or judging of the show. Also ineligible were candidates for political office and individuals who had appeared on a different game show outside of cable that had been broadcast within the past year, was intended to be broadcast within the next year, or had played the main game on any of the U.S. versions of ''Millionaire'' itself.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/>\n\nPotential contestants of the original primetime version had to compete in a telephone contest which had them dial a toll-free number and answer three questions by putting objects or events in order. Callers had ten seconds to enter the order on a keypad, with any incorrect answer ending the game/call. The 10,000 to 20,000 candidates who answered all three questions correctly were selected into a random drawing in which approximately 300 contestants competed for ten spots on the show using the same phone quiz method.{{refn|To qualify for 2004's ''Super Millionaire'' spin-off, potential contestants were required to answer five questions. Each person who successfully answered all five questions chose one tape date, and the contestants for that tape date were drawn from that pool.|group=note}} Accommodations for contestants outside the New York City area included round trip airfare (or other transportation) and hotel accommodations.\n\nThe syndicated version's potential contestants, depending on tryouts, were required to pass an electronically scored test<ref name=\"About.com\">{{cite web|url=http://gameshows.about.com/od/beacontestant/a/wwtbamauditions.htm |title=Be a Contestant on Who Wants to be a Millionaire |last=Grosvenor |first=Carrie |publisher=about.com |accessdate=August 13, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113020940/http://gameshows.about.com/od/beacontestant/a/wwtbamauditions.htm |archivedate=November 13, 2016 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> comprising a set of thirty questions which had to be answered within a 10-minute time limit. Contestants who failed the test were eliminated, while those who passed were interviewed for an audition by the production staff,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.seattletimes.com/html/television/2003638513_tvgameshowaudition28.html|title=Who wants to be a game-show contestant?|first=Claudia|last=Perry|date=March 28, 2007|work=The Seattle Times|accessdate=July 16, 2010}}</ref> and those who impressed the staff the most were then notified by postal mail that they had been placed into a pool for possible selection as contestants. At the producers' discretion, contestants from said pool were selected to appear on actual episodes of the syndicated program; these contestants were given a phone call from staff and asked to confirm the information on their initial application form and verify that they met all eligibility requirements. Afterwards, they were given a date to travel to the show's taping facilities to participate in a scheduled episode of the show.<ref name=\"About.com\"/> Unlike its ABC counterpart, the syndicated version did not offer transportation or hotel accommodations to contestants at the production company's expense; that version's contestants were instead required to provide transportation and accommodations of their own.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/>\n\nThe syndicated ''Millionaire'' also conducts open casting calls in various locations across the United States to search for potential contestants. These are held in late spring or early summer, with all dates and locations posted on the show's official website. The producers make no guarantee on how many applicants will be tested at each particular venue;<ref name=\"About.com\"/> however, the show will not test any more than 2,500 individuals per audition day.<ref name=\"millionairetv\"/>\n\nIn cases when the show features themed episodes with two people playing as a team, auditions for these episodes' contestants are announced on the show's website. Both members of the team must pass the written test and the audition interview successfully in order to be considered for selection. If only one member of the team passes, he or she is placed into the contestant pool alone and must continue the audition process as an individual in order to proceed.<ref name=\"About.com\"/>\n\n===Music===\nOriginally, the U.S. ''Millionaire'' carried over the musical score from the British version, composed by father-and-son duo [[Keith Strachan|Keith]] and [[Matthew Strachan]]. Unlike older game show musical scores, ''Millionaire''{{'}}s musical score was created to feature music playing almost throughout the entire show. The Strachans' main ''Millionaire'' [[theme song]] took some inspiration from the \"Mars\" movement of [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'',<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\">{{cite news|title=Million Pound Notes: Keith Strachan|last=Smurthwaite|first=Nick|newspaper=[[The Stage]]|date=March 21, 2005|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612081217/http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991|archivedate=June 12, 2011}}</ref> and their question cues from the $2,000 to the $32,000/$25,000 level, and then from the $64,000/$50,000 to $500,000 level, took the pitch up a semitone for each subsequent question, in order to increase tension as the contestant progressed through the game.<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\"/> On GSN's ''Gameshow Hall of Fame'' special, the narrator described the Strachan tracks as \"mimicking the sound of a beating heart\", and stated that as the contestant worked their way up the money ladder, the music was \"perfectly in tune with their ever-increasing pulse\".<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nThe original ''Millionaire'' musical score holds the distinction of being the only game show soundtrack to be acknowledged by the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]], as the Strachans were honored with numerous ASCAP awards for their work, the earliest of them awarded in 2000.<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\"/> The original music cues were given minor rearrangements for the clock format in 2008; for example, the question cues were synced to the \"ticking\" sounds of the game clock. Even later, the Strachan score was removed from the U.S. version altogether for the introduction of the shuffle format in 2010, in favor of a new musical score with cues written by Jeff Lippencott and Mark T. Williams, co-founders of the Los Angeles-based company [[Ah2 Music]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Ah2 Music Marks 10th Anniversary|url=http://www.trailermusicvibe.com/ah2-music-marks-10th-anniversary/|publisher=TrailerMusicVibe|date=August 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Set===\nThe U.S. ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s basic set was a direct adaptation of the British version's set design, which was conceived by [[Andy Walmsley]]. Paul Smith's original licensing agreement for the U.S. ''Millionaire'' required that the show's set design, along with all other elements of the show's on-air presentation (musical score, lighting system, host's wardrobe, etc.), adhere faithfully to the way in which they were presented in the British version; this same licensing agreement applied to all other international versions of the show, making Walmsley's ''Millionaire'' set design the most reproduced scenic design in television history.<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/> The original version of the U.S. ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s set cost $200,000 to construct.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The U.S. ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Production designer|production design]] was handled at different times by David Weller, Jim Fenhagen and George Allison.<ref name=\"Production credits\"/>\n\nUnlike older game shows whose sets are or were designed to make the contestant(s) feel at ease, ''Millionaire''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s set was designed to make the contestant feel uncomfortable, so that the program feels more like a movie thriller than a typical quiz show.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The floor is made of [[Plexiglas]]<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/> beneath which lies a huge dish covered in mirror paper.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> Before the shuffle format was implemented in 2010, the main game had the contestant and host sit in chairs in the center of the stage, known as \"Hot Seats\"; these measured {{convert|3|ft|m}} high, were modeled after chairs typically found in [[hair salon]]s,<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> and each seat featured a computer monitor directly facing it to display questions and other pertinent information. Shortly after the shuffle format was introduced to ''Millionaire'', Vieira stated in an interview with her ''Millionaire'' predecessor on [[Live with Kelly and Michael|his morning talk show]] that the Hot Seat was removed because it was decided that the seat, which was originally intended to make the contestant feel nervous, actually ended up having contestants feel so comfortable in it that it did not service the production team any longer.<ref name=\"Regis and Kelly\">{{Cite episode|title=Season 23, Episode 8|series=Live! with Regis and Kelly|airdate=September 15, 2010|network=Syndicated|credits=Disney-ABC Domestic Television}}</ref>\n\nThe lighting system was programmed to darken the set as the contestant progressed further into the game. There were also spotlights situated at the bottom of the set area that zoomed down on the contestant when they answered a major question; to increase the visibility of the light beams emitted by such spotlights, oil was vaporized, creating a haze effect. [[Media scholar]] [[Robert Thompson (media scholar)|Dr. Robert Thompson]], a professor at [[Syracuse University]], stated that the show's lighting system made the contestant feel as though they were outside of prison when an escape was in progress.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nWhen the shuffle format was introduced, the Hot Seats and corresponding monitors were replaced with a single podium, so that the contestant and host stood throughout the game and were also able to walk around the stage.<ref name=\"Regis and Kelly\"/> Also, two video screens were installed\u2013one that displayed the current question in play, and another that displayed the contestant's cumulative total and progress during the game. In September 2012, the redesigned set was improved with a modernized look and feel, in order to take into account the show's transition to [[High-definition television|high-definition broadcasting]], which had just come about the previous year. The two video screens were replaced with two larger ones, having twice as many projectors as the previous screens had; the previous contestant podium was replaced with a new one; and [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) technology was integrated into the lighting system to give the lights more vivid colors and the set and gameplay experience a more intimate feel.<ref name=\"New set\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/anderson-live-wendy-williams-rachael-369024|title=''Anderson Live'', ''Wendy Williams'', ''Rachael Ray'' Among Syndicated Shows Getting Set Makeovers (Photos)|first=Kimberly|last=Nordyke|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=September 10, 2012|accessdate=September 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast history==\n===ABC===\nThe U.S. version of ''Millionaire'' was launched by ABC as a half-hour primetime program on August 16, 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/broadcast/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-returns-for-ten-year-anniversary/24432/|title=''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' Returns for its Ten Year Anniversary|work=[[TV By the Numbers]]|publisher=Zap2it|last=Seidman|first=Robert|date=August 9, 2009|accessdate=August 6, 2014}}</ref> When it premiered, it became the first U.S. network game show to offer a million-dollar top prize to contestants.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> After airing thirteen episodes and reaching an audience of 15 million viewers by the end of the show's first week on the air, the program expanded to an hour-long format when it returned in November.<ref name=\"Far from\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/09/arts/television/09cart.html?pagewanted=all|title=''Millionaire'' Far From Its Final Answer|last=Carter|first=Bill|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 9, 2009|accessdate=January 20, 2018}}</ref> The series, of which episodes were originally shown only a day after their initial taping, was promoted to regular status on January 18, 2000<ref>{{citation|title=Disney Factbook 2000 \u2013 Year in Review|author=Walt Disney Company|date=February 5, 2001|page=7}}</ref> and, at the height of its popularity, was airing on ABC five nights a week.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/05/abc-hopes-who-wants-to-be_n_251566.html |title=\"ABC Hopes \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire\" Lightning Can Strike Twice\" |last=Bauder |first=David |work=[[Huffington Post]] |date=August 4, 2009 |accessdate=August 18, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304132904/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/05/abc-hopes-who-wants-to-be_n_251566.html |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The show was so popular during its original primetime run that rival networks created or re-incarnated game shows of their own (e.g., ''[[Greed (game show)|Greed]]'', ''[[Twenty One (game show)#2000|Twenty One]]'', etc.), as well as importing various game shows of British and Australian origin to America (such as ''[[Winning Lines (American game show)|Winning Lines]]'', ''[[Weakest Link (American game show)|Weakest Link]]'', and ''[[It's Your Chance of a Lifetime]]'').\n\nThe nighttime version initially drew in up to 30 million viewers a day three times a week, an unheard-of number in modern network television. In the 1999\u20132000 season, it averaged No. 1 in the ratings against all other television shows,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fbibler.chez.com/tvstats/recent_data/1999-00.html|title=TV Ratings 1999\u20132000|publisher=fbibler.chez.com|accessdate=March 11, 2013}}</ref> with 28,848,000 viewers.

Despite the ratings struggles of the network edition, there was still enough interest in ''Millionaire'' as a series that enough stations signed on for a fall 2002 launch; the original idea for the syndicated series to serve as an accompaniment to the network series did not come to fruition, as intended, due to ABC's decision to cancel ''Millionaire''.<ref name=\"weekday millionaire\"/><ref name=\"tvseriesfinale.com\"/> \n\nOn September 16, 2002, nearly three months after the network ''Millionaire'' ended its run, the syndicated series premiered. Right away, it found itself having similar ratings issues. Some stations began to look for other options to place in the slots where they had initially plugged ''Millionaire''; this included several larger market stations, especially their largest market affiliate, and thus ''Millionaire'' was looking at a second cancellation notice in less than a year. As fate would have it, though, this turn of events happened to coincide with a significant one going on at two of BVT's corporate siblings.\n\nWhen BVT initially sold ''Millionaire'' into syndication, the largest market station to come on board was [[WCBS-TV]] in New York, the flagship of the [[CBS]] network. Looking to bolster its offerings in the two hours between the end of CBS' daytime schedule and its first evening newscast of the day, which had been an ongoing problem for the station for years, ''Millionaire'' was one of two major additions to WCBS' lineup for the 2002\u20132003 season. The station gave it the 4 pm weekday timeslot that had housed ''[[Weakest Link (American game show)|Weakest Link]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/20/arts/tv-notes-games-to-clash-on-syndication.html|title=TV Notes: Games to Clash on Syndication|work=The New York Times|last=Carter|first=Bill|date=June 20, 2001|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref> <ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://adage.com/article/special-report-hoagtest01/dr-phil-millionaire-john-walsh-arrive-heat-factor-lacking/52202/|title='Dr. Phil,' 'Millionaire,' 'John Walsh' arrive, but heat factor is lacking|magazine=Advertising Age|last=Pendleton|first=Jennifer|date=May 13, 2002|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref> a syndicated version of another network primetime quiz show (in this case, produced by NBC) that had launched in January 2002.\n\nThe timeslot, at the time, was a fairly competitive one. [[WABC-TV]] had been airing ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', which had consistently been the most popular daytime talk show, there since September 1986. [[WNBC]] at the time carried ''[[Judge Judy]]'', which was the second-highest rated program in daytime syndication behind ''Oprah''. ''Millionaire'' was unable to cut into the audience for either program, despite having the other major WCBS acquisition, the talk show ''[[Dr. Phil (talk show)|Dr. Phil]]'', as its lead in. WCBS again decided to switch its lineup.\n\nIn April 2003, with the season in its final weeks, WCBS announced its addition of ''[[The People's Court]]'' to its lineup for fall 2003 after the revived series had aired since its 1997 debut on WNBC.<ref name=\"Millionaire Poorer\"/> WCBS announced that ''The People's Court'' would be airing at 4:00 pm once it joined the station's lineup, which meant that ''Millionaire'' would be forced out of the timeslot after one year. BVT tried to negotiate with WCBS for another timeslot but the station had other obligations and thus could not accommodate them. There was not much in the way of open time slots on any of the other New York stations either, as they had other obligations in daytime and nighttime fringe slots, and BVT was in a position that could have seen ''Millionaire'' be reduced to airing in a post-midnight period or another non-traditional time that syndicators try to avoid. <ref name=\"Millionaire Poorer\">{{Cite news|url=http://business.highbeam.com/2012/article-1G1-95355049/millionaire-poorer-ny-game-loses-wcbs-plum-4-pm-slot|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808042435/http://business.highbeam.com/2012/article-1G1-95355049/millionaire-poorer-ny-game-loses-wcbs-plum-4-pm-slot|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 8, 2014|title=''Millionaire'' poorer in N.Y.|url-access=subscription |work=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Highbeam Business|date=December 2, 2002|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref> <ref name=\"Millionaire Poorer\"/> \n\nMeanwhile, ABC was about to shake up its daytime schedule in a move made shortly after ''Millionaire'' concluded its season. The network had long programmed a thirty-minute serial at 12:30 pm, and since 1997 that time slot had belonged to ''[[Port Charles]]''. In July 2003, however, the network decided that it would be discontinuing the program after its contract to air it expired in October and, once that happened, the timeslot ''Port Charles'' had occupied would be given back to the affiliates to program as they wished. BVT decided to go to its parent company's flagship station and offered ''Millionaire'' to WABC as the replacement for ''Port Charles'', and the two sides agreed. Beginning in September 2003, ''Millionaire'' joined WABC's lineup and remained part of the station's lineup for the rest of its run.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/television/brief_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1967240|title=''Millionaire'' nabs key slots in syndication|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=September 2, 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030907080505/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/television/brief_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1967240|archivedate=September 7, 2003}}</ref> ABC was impressed enough with the ratings improvement that the network, with one or two exceptions ([[WLS-TV]] in Chicago and [[KABC-TV]] in Los Angeles, though the latter would eventually add the series) picked up ''Millionaire'' for the other stations it owned.\n\nFollowing the 2014\u201315 season, ''Millionaire'' nearly was cancelled after a disagreement with BVT's successor, Disney-ABC Domestic Television, and [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]], the owner of the  format rights through its subsidiary [[2waytraffic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://millionairetv.dadt.com/local-listings/|title=Local Listings|publisher=Millionaire TV|accessdate=August 20, 2014}}</ref> According to e-mails released in the [[Sony Pictures Entertainment hack]], ''Millionaire'''s declining ratings prompted DADT to demand a dramatically reduced licensing fee for renewal, which SPE was hesitant to accept. The two sides eventually agreed on terms for renewal, which included a return to the original question format (but with fourteen questions) and cuts to the production budget, which resulted in the series leaving New York for [[Stamford, Connecticut]] (although this had been done in 2014) and later moving to [[Las Vegas]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Anotado|first=Cory|url=http://www.buzzerblog.com/2015/06/29/millionaire-re-introduces-ladder-format-for-2015-season/|title=Millionaire re-introduces ladder format for 2015 season|work=Buzzerblog|date=June 29, 2015|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}</ref> Had the show not been renewed, SPE was going to place the show on extended hiatus for three years, after which it would reclaim full rights to the show and be free to shop the revived show to another network or syndicator.

When ''FABlife'' failed to gain an audience and was cancelled at midseason, ''Millionaire'' was able to return to many of its former airing tines for 2016; beginning that year, ''Millionaire'' and the viral video show ''[[RightThisMinute]]'' began being sold as a package to ABC stations. \n\nOn January 17, 2017, it was announced that ''Millionaire'' has been renewed through 2018.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lincoln|first1=Ross|title=''Who Wants To Be A Millionaire'' & ''RightThisMinute'' Renewed For Syndication On ABC Stations Through 2018|url=http://deadline.com/2017/01/millionaire-rightthisminute-renewed-through-2018-on-abc-channels-1201884820/|website=Deadline Hollywood|publisher=PMC|date=January 17, 2017|accessdate=January 23, 2018}}</ref> Millionaire was subsequently renewed through the 2018\u201319 season on January 17, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/abc-renews-who-wants-be-a-millionaire-17th-season-1075368|title=''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' Renewed for 17th Season on ABC Stations|last=Sandberg|first=Bryn Elise|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=January 17, 2018|accessdate=January 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAs the seventeenth season progressed, the future of ''Millionaire'' became uncertain.

As usual, contestants had to answer a series of 15 multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty, but the dollar values rose substantially. The questions for ''Super Millionaire'' were worth $1,000, $2,000, $3,000, $4,000, $5,000 (the first safe haven), $10,000, $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $100,000 (the second safe haven), $500,000, $1,000,000, $2,500,000, $5,000,000, and '''$10,000,000'''.\n\nContestants were given the standard three lifelines in place at the time (50:50, Ask the Audience, and Phone-a-Friend) at the beginning of the game. However, after correctly answering the $100,000 question, the contestant earned two additional lifelines: Three Wise Men and Double Dip.<ref name=SuperMillionaire/> The Three Wise Men lifeline involved a panel of three experts, one of whom was always a former ''Millionaire'' contestant and at least one of whom was female. When this lifeline was used, the contestant and panel had 30 seconds to discuss the question and choices before the audio and video feeds were dropped. Double Dip gave a contestant two chances to answer a question. Once used, the contestant must answer the question without using any further lifelines; moreover, if the \"first final answer\" was incorrect, the contestant could ''not'' walk away. If the \"second final answer\" was also wrong, the contestant left with $100,000.\n\n===''10th Anniversary Celebration''===\nTo celebrate the tenth anniversary of ''Millionaire''{{'}}s U.S. debut, the show returned to ABC primetime for an eleven-night event hosted by Philbin, which aired from August 9 to 23, 2009.<ref name=\"accesshollywood.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/articles/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-returns-with-a-hollywood-makeover-74474/|title=''Who Wants To Be A Millionaire'' Returns With A Hollywood Makeover|publisher=AccessHollywood.com|accessdate=April 2, 2017}}</ref> The [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning movie ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' and the [[Late-2000s recession|2008 economic crisis]] helped boost interest of renewal of the game show.<ref name=\"tvseriesfinale.com\"/>\n\nThe episodes featured game play based on the previous rule set of the syndicated version (including the rule changes implemented in season seven) but used the Fastest Finger round to select contestants.

Contestants were seeded based on how much money they had won, with the biggest winner ranked first and the lowest ranked tenth. Ties were broken based on how much time a contestant had banked when they had walked away from the game.<ref name=\"Tournament\">{{cite web|url=http://gameshows.about.com/od/millionaireglossary/g/tournament_of_ten.htm |title='Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' Tournament of Ten |publisher=about.com |accessdate=July 16, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113062329/http://gameshows.about.com/od/millionaireglossary/g/tournament_of_ten.htm |archivedate=November 13, 2009 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe tournament began on the episode aired November 9, 2009, and playing in order from the lowest to the highest seed, tournament contestants played one at a time at the end of that episode and the next nine. The rules were exactly the same as they were for a normal million dollar question under the clock format introduced the season before, except here, the contestants had no lifelines at their disposal. Each contestant received a base time of 45 seconds. For each question they had answered before walking away, the contestants received any unused seconds that were left when they gave their answers. The accumulated total of those unused seconds was then added to the base time to give the contestants their final question time limit.<ref name=\"Tournament\"/>\n\nEach contestant had the same decision facing them as before, which was whether to attempt to answer the question or walk away with their pre-tournament total intact. Attempting the question and answering incorrectly incurred the same penalty as in regular play, with a reduction of their pre-tournament winnings to $25,000. If the question was answered correctly, the player that did so became the tournament leader. If another player after him/her answered correctly, that player assumed the lead and the previous leader kept their pre-tournament winnings. The highest remaining seed to have attempted and correctly answered their question at the end of the tournament on November 20, 2009 would be declared the winner and become the syndicated series' third millionaire.<ref name=\"Tournament\"/>\n\nThe first contestant to attempt to answer the million dollar question was Sam Murray, the tournament's eighth-seeded qualifier. On November 11, Murray was asked approximately how many people had lived on Earth in its history and correctly guessed 100 billion. Murray was still atop the leaderboard entering the November 20 finale as he remained the only contestant to even attempt to answer his or her question. The only person who could defeat him was top seed and $250,000 winner Jehan Shamsid-Deen, who was asked a question regarding the [[Blorenge]], cited as \"a rare example of a word that rhymes with orange\". Shamsid-Deen considered taking the risk, believing (correctly) that the name belonged to a mountain in [[Wales]]. However, she decided that the potential of losing $225,000 did not justify the risk and elected to walk away from the question, giving Murray the win and the million dollar prize.<ref name=\"Murray millionaire\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nSince its introduction to the United States, GSN credited ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' with not only single-handedly reviving the game show genre, but also breaking new ground for it.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The series revolutionized the look and feel of game shows with its unique lighting system, dramatic music cues, and futuristic set.

Contestants competed against eight other ''Millionaire'' fans in round one, with the top three playing round two alone. There was no \"final answer\" rule; the contestant's responses were automatically locked in. Answering a question correctly earned a contestant the value of that question, multiplied by the number of people who responded incorrectly.

Both the Florida and California ''Play It!'' attractions opened in 2001; the California version closed in 2004,<ref>{{cite book|last=Shaffer|first=Joshua C.|title=Discovering the Magic Kingdom: An Unofficial Disneyland Vacation Guide|publisher=Author House|year=2010|page=207|isbn=9781452063133}}</ref> and the Florida version closed in 2006 and was replaced by ''[[Toy Story Midway Mania!]]''\n\nThe format in the ''Play It!'' attraction was very similar to that of the television show that inspired it. When a show started, a Fastest Finger question was given, and the audience was asked to put the four answers in order; the person with the fastest time was the first contestant in the Hot Seat for that show. However, the main game had some differences: for example, contestants competed for points rather than dollars, the questions were set to time limits, and the Phone-a-Friend lifeline became ''Phone a Complete Stranger'' which connected the contestant to a Disney cast member outside the attraction's theater who would find a guest to help. After the contestant's game was over, they were awarded anything from a collectible pin, to clothing, to a ''Millionaire'' CD game, to a 3-night [[Disney Cruise Line|Disney Cruise]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Who Wants to Be a Winner?

Michot]], the Lafayette businessman who served in the [[Louisiana House of Representatives]] from 1960 to 1964, ran for [[governor of Louisiana]] in the 1963 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[primary election]], and served as the state education superintendent from 1972 to 1976, described Authement, prior to retirement from ULL, accordingly:\n\n<blockquote>\n\nIn spite of all the things he must have put up with in 30-something years, he's still there. ... In a political climate like Louisiana, he stayed head of a public institution for one-third of a century. He must have been doing something right.<ref name=newsmaker/></blockquote>\n\nRaymond \"Coach\" Blanco, a former ULL dean of students and the husband of former Governor [[Kathleen Babineaux Blanco]] said that Authement, who was in competition with presidents from other state institutions, such as [[F. Jay Taylor]] and [[Dan Reneau]] of [[Louisiana Tech University]] and [[Rene J. Bienvenu]] of [[Northwestern State University]], for limited available funds, \"never believed in going down and playing the [lobbying] game in Baton Rouge. He always thought that if you did what you're supposed to do and had the merit that you would get rewarded. And sometimes that worked, and sometimes it didn't ...\"<ref name=newsmaker/>\n\nIn reality though, Authement was like most college presidents a politician but not the kind who places  his name on a ballot. He developed close ties to the local political elite, having met on occasion with the late Lafayette Mayor [[J. Rayburn Bertrand]] and Sheriff Carlo Listi. Authement also established a close friendship with the clothing merchants, the brothers Edward and Herbert Abdalla, all of these interactions even before he became ULL president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theind.com/cover-story/243|title=Closing Time|publisher=theind.com|accessdate=June 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\nFormer Governor Blanco said of Authement:\n\n<blockquote>\n\nHe had great academic vision. He knew how to drive areas of excellence. And that takes a lot of fortitude. There's a lot of campus politics that goes on. He had to convince that faculty, and they understood and went along with his program that achieving areas of excellence would bring the university out of being a little country school with limited vision and limited education for its students and into the modern world.

Michot]], the Lafayette businessman who served in the [[Louisiana House of Representatives]] from 1960 to 1964, ran for [[governor of Louisiana]] in the 1963 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[primary election]], and served as the state education superintendent from 1972 to 1976, described Authement, prior to retirement from ULL, accordingly:\n\n<blockquote>\n\nIn spite of all the things he must have put up with in 30-something years, he's still there. ... In a political climate like Louisiana, he stayed head of a public institution for one-third of a century. He must have been doing something right.<ref name=newsmaker/></blockquote>\n\nRaymond \"Coach\" Blanco, a former ULL dean of students and the husband of former Governor [[Kathleen Babineaux Blanco]] said that Authement, who was in competition with presidents from other state institutions, such as [[F. Jay Taylor]] and [[Dan Reneau]] of [[Louisiana Tech University]] and [[Rene J. Bienvenu]] of [[Northwestern State University]], for limited available funds, \"never believed in going down and playing the [lobbying] game in Baton Rouge. He always thought that if you did what you're supposed to do and had the merit that you would get rewarded. And sometimes that worked, and sometimes it didn't ...\"<ref name=newsmaker/>\n\nIn reality though, Authement was like most college presidents a politician but not the kind who places  his name on a ballot. He developed close ties to the local political elite, having met on occasion with the late Lafayette Mayor [[J. Rayburn Bertrand]] and Sheriff Carlo Listi. Authement also established a close friendship with the clothing merchants, the brothers Edward and Herbert Abdalla, all of these interactions even before he became ULL president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theind.com/cover-story/243|title=Closing Time|publisher=theind.com|accessdate=June 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\nFormer Governor Blanco said of Authement:\n\n<blockquote>\n\nHe had great academic vision. He knew how to drive areas of excellence. And that takes a lot of fortitude. There's a lot of campus politics that goes on. He had to convince that faculty, and they understood and went along with his program that achieving areas of excellence would bring the university out of being a little country school with limited vision and limited education for its students and into the modern world. And they understood that and supported it. That's very hard to do. There are many campuses that have never been able to get that far down the road.<ref name=newsmaker/></blockquote>\n\nIn retirement, Authement and his wife resided in Lafayette.\n\n==Death==\nOn April 5, 2020, Authement succumbed to an \"extended illness\" at the age of 91 in [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]].

{"title_page": "Greek to me", "text_new": "'''That's Greek to me''' or '''it's (all) Greek to me''' is an [[idiom]] in English, expressing that something is difficult to understand.\n\nThe idiom is typically used with respect to something of a foreign nature, however it may be considered an insult to some. Complexity or imprecision of [[Speech|verbal]] or [[Writing|written]] expression or [[diagram]], often containing excessive use of [[jargon]], [[dialect]], [[mathematics]], [[science]], [[symbols]], or diagrams. The metaphor makes reference to [[Greek language|Greek]] (either [[Ancient Greek|ancient]] or [[Modern Greek|modern]]), as an [[Archetype|archetypal]] foreign form of communication both written and spoken. Technically, the phrase is classified as a [[dead metaphor]], meaning that its components cannot be used separately, unlike for example the dormant metaphor \"foot of the hill\", which permits saying \"that hill has a tree at its foot\". \n\n==Origins==\nIt may have been a direct translation of a similar phrase in {{lang-la|\"Graecum est; non legitur\"}} (\"it is Greek, [therefore] it cannot be read\"). This phrase was increasingly used by monk scribes in the Middle Ages, as knowledge of the Greek alphabet and language was dwindling among those who were copying manuscripts in monastic libraries.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nRecorded usage of the metaphor in English traces back to the [[early modern period]]. It appears in 1599 in Shakespeare's play ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', as spoken by [[Servilius Casca]] to [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] after a festival in which Caesar was offered a crown:\n{{quote|text=\nCASSIUS: Did Cicero say any thing?<br/>\nCASCA: Ay, he spoke Greek.<br/>\nCASSIUS: To what effect?<br/>\nCASCA: Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' the face again: but those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own part, '''it was Greek to me'''. I could tell you more news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you well. There was more foolery yet, if I could remember it.\n|source=[[William Shakespeare]], ''[[The Tragedy of Julius Caesar]]'' (1599)}}\n\nHere, Casca's literal ignorance of Greek is the source of the phrase, using its common meaning to play on the uncertainty among the conspirators about [[Cicero]]'s attitude to Caesar's increasingly regal behaviour. Shakespeare was not the only author to use the expression.{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\nIt was also used in 1603 by [[Thomas Dekker (writer)|Thomas Dekker]] in his play ''[[Patient Grissel]]'':\n{{quote|text=\nFAR: Asking for a Greek poet, to him he fails. I\u2019ll be sworn he knows not so much as one character of the tongue.<br/>\nRIC: Why, then it\u2019s Greek to him.\n|source=[[Thomas Dekker (writer)|Thomas Dekker]], ''[[Patient Grissel]]'' (1603)}}\n\nThe expression is almost exclusively used with reference to the speaker (generally \"Greek to me\"); Dekker's \"Greek to him\" is rare.\n\n==Variations==\nDifferent languages have similar formulations. Many have picked the point of reference to be a foreign language with another [[alphabet]] or [[writing system]].\n\nThis is an example of the usage of [[demonym]]s in relation to the ability of a people to be understood, comparable to the development of the words ''[[barbarian]]'' (one who babbles), ''Nemec'' ([[Slavic language|Slavic]] for \"the mute one\" indicating [[Germans]]).\n\n===In other languages===\nIn an article published by Arnold L. Rosenberg in the language journal ''[[Lingvisticae Investigationes|Lingvistic\u00e6 Investigationes]]'', he claimed that there was a popular \"consensus\" that [[Chinese language|Chinese]] was the \"hardest\" language, since various non-English languages most frequently used the Chinese language in their equivalent expression to the English idiom \"it's all Greek to me\".<ref>Rosenberg, A. (1979). Lingvistic\u00e6 Investigationes:III 3(2). 323-339</ref> Also, David Moser of the University of Michigan Center for Chinese Studies made the same claim as Arnold L.

me''' or '''it's (all) Greek to me''' is an [[idiom]] in English, expressing that something is difficult to understand.\n\nThe idiom is typically used with respect to something of a foreign nature, however it may be considered an insult to some. Complexity or imprecision of [[Speech|verbal]] or [[Writing|written]] expression or [[diagram]], often containing excessive use of [[jargon]], [[dialect]], [[mathematics]], [[science]], [[symbols]], or diagrams. The metaphor makes reference to [[Greek language|Greek]] (either [[Ancient Greek|ancient]] or [[Modern Greek|modern]]), as an [[Archetype|archetypal]] foreign form of communication both written and spoken. Technically, the phrase is classified as a [[dead metaphor]], meaning that its components cannot be used separately, unlike for example the dormant metaphor \"foot of the hill\", which permits saying \"that hill has a tree at its foot\". \n\n==Origins==\nIt may have been a direct translation of a similar phrase in {{lang-la|\"Graecum est; non legitur\"}} (\"it is Greek, [therefore] it cannot be read\"). This phrase was increasingly used by monk scribes in the Middle Ages, as knowledge of the Greek alphabet and language was dwindling among those who were copying manuscripts in monastic libraries.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nRecorded usage of the metaphor in English traces back to the [[early modern period]]. It appears in 1599 in Shakespeare's play ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', as spoken by [[Servilius Casca]] to [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] after a festival in which Caesar was offered a crown:\n{{quote|text=\nCASSIUS: Did Cicero say any thing?<br/>\nCASCA: Ay, he spoke Greek.<br/>\nCASSIUS: To what effect?<br/>\nCASCA: Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' the face again: but those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own part, '''it was Greek to me'''. I could tell you more news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you well. There was more foolery yet, if I could remember it.\n|source=[[William Shakespeare]], ''[[The Tragedy of Julius Caesar]]'' (1599)}}\n\nHere, Casca's literal ignorance of Greek is the source of the phrase, using its common meaning to play on the uncertainty among the conspirators about [[Cicero]]'s attitude to Caesar's increasingly regal behaviour. Shakespeare was not the only author to use the expression.{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\nIt was also used in 1603 by [[Thomas Dekker (writer)|Thomas Dekker]] in his play ''[[Patient Grissel]]'':\n{{quote|text=\nFAR: Asking for a Greek poet, to him he fails. I\u2019ll be sworn he knows not so much as one character of the tongue.<br/>\nRIC: Why, then it\u2019s Greek to him.\n|source=[[Thomas Dekker (writer)|Thomas Dekker]], ''[[Patient Grissel]]'' (1603)}}\n\nThe expression is almost exclusively used with reference to the speaker (generally \"Greek to me\"); Dekker's \"Greek to him\" is rare.\n\n==Variations==\nDifferent languages have similar formulations. Many have picked the point of reference to be a foreign language with another [[alphabet]] or [[writing system]].\n\nThis is an example of the usage of [[demonym]]s in relation to the ability of a people to be understood, comparable to the development of the words ''[[barbarian]]'' (one who babbles), ''Nemec'' ([[Slavic language|Slavic]] for \"the mute one\" indicating [[Germans]]).\n\n===In other languages===\nIn an article published by Arnold L. Rosenberg in the language journal ''[[Lingvisticae Investigationes|Lingvistic\u00e6 Investigationes]]'', he claimed that there was a popular \"consensus\" that [[Chinese language|Chinese]] was the \"hardest\" language, since various non-English languages most frequently used the Chinese language in their equivalent expression to the English idiom \"it's all Greek to me\".<ref>Rosenberg, A. (1979). Lingvistic\u00e6 Investigationes:III 3(2). 323-339</ref> Also, David Moser of the University of Michigan Center for Chinese Studies made the same claim as Arnold L. Rosenberg.<ref name=\"Moser\">Moser, D. P\u012bny\u012bn.Info. Why Chinese Is So Damn Hard.

The mounted raiders achieved complete surprise, capturing the Federal garrison and destroying $1.5 million of supplies intended for [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s army. In the following days, Van Dorn's troopers moved north along the [[Mississippi Central Railroad]] almost to [[Bolivar, Tennessee]], destroying track and bridges, before escaping into northern Mississippi. The damage inflicted by the Holly Springs Raid together with the harm caused by [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]]'s [[West Tennessee Raids]] forced Grant's Union army to withdraw to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].   \n\n==Background==\nAfter Van Dorn's defeat in the [[Second Battle of Corinth]] on October 3\u20134, 1862, Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]] named [[John C. Pemberton]] to lead the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana and elevated him in rank to [[Lieutenant General]]. The promotion made Pemberton superior to Van Dorn.{{sfn|Cozzens|1997|p=307}} On October 25, Grant assumed command of the Department of Tennessee and a week later he started the [[Vicksburg campaign]].{{sfn|Boatner|1959|p=871}} By the end of October, Grant massed almost 50,000 Federal troops around Memphis and [[Corinth, Mississippi]].{{sfn|Cozzens|1997|p=309}} Grant planned to move south along the Mississippi Central Railroad with 40,000 troops.{{sfn|Boatner|1959|p=871}} As he awaited approval from Union General-in-chief [[Henry Halleck]], Grant began concentrating five divisions at [[Grand Junction, Tennessee]]. When Halleck endorsed the plan and told Grant that 20,000 additional reinforcements were forthcoming, Grant decided to wait for the new troops. However, he sent [[James B. McPherson]] ahead with two divisions. Though a recent prisoner exchange swelled Van Dorn's strength to 24,000 troops, many of his soldiers were in poor health and the onset of cold weather increased the sick list.{{sfn|Cozzens|1997|p=309}} \n\nOn November 9, Van Dorn withdrew from Holly Springs to a new defensive line behind the [[Tallahatchie River]]. On December 1, Grant pressed forward again.{{sfn|Cozzens|1997|p=310}} A Federal force under [[Alvin Peterson Hovey]] steamed down the [[Mississippi River]], landed at [[Greenville, Mississippi]], and marched inland toward the railroad.{{sfn|Atkinson|2018}} Van Dorn retreated behind the [[Yalobusha River]] covering [[Grenada, Mississippi|Grenada]], only {{cvt|120|mi|km|0}} north of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]].{{sfn|Cozzens|1997|p=310}} At this time, Lieutenant Colonel John S. Griffiths of the [[6th Texas Cavalry Regiment]] suggested raiding Grant's supply base at Holly Springs.{{sfn|Bridges|2011}} Pemberton liked the idea and gave Van Dorn three brigades of cavalry to attempt the raid. He assigned Van Dorn's corps to [[Dabney H. Maury]].{{sfn|Cozzens|1997|p=310}}\n\nMeanwhile, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] authorized [[John A. McClernand]] to raise an army in the Midwestern states and lead it in an expedition against Vicksburg. McClernand's program was successful in recruiting large numbers of Union soldiers, which were forwarded to Memphis. The problem was that McClernand's expedition would be operating in a department commanded by Grant, a violation of the principle of [[Unity of command]]. Furthermore, neither Grant nor General-in-chief [[Henry Halleck]] liked McClernand. Halleck told Grant that all troops in the department were his to command. Grant ordered [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] to take the soldiers at Memphis down the Mississippi River, enter the [[Yazoo River]], and assault Vicksburg from the north. On 18 December, Halleck telegraphed Grant that the troops at Memphis were to be organized into two corps, one under McClernand and one under Sherman.

The mounted raiders achieved complete surprise, capturing the Federal garrison and destroying $1.5 million of supplies intended for [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s army. In the following days, Van Dorn's troopers moved north along the [[Mississippi Central Railroad]] almost to [[Bolivar, Tennessee]], destroying track and bridges, before escaping into northern Mississippi. The damage inflicted by the Holly Springs Raid together with the harm caused by [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]]'s [[West Tennessee Raids]] forced Grant's Union army to withdraw to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].   \n\n==Background==\nAfter Van Dorn's defeat in the [[Second Battle of Corinth]] on October 3\u20134, 1862, Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]] named [[John C. Pemberton]] to lead the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana and elevated him in rank to [[Lieutenant General]]. The promotion made Pemberton superior to Van Dorn.{{sfn|Cozzens|1997|p=307}} On October 25, Grant assumed command of the Department of Tennessee and a week later he started the [[Vicksburg campaign]].{{sfn|Boatner|1959|p=871}} By the end of October, Grant massed almost 50,000 Federal troops around Memphis and [[Corinth, Mississippi]].{{sfn|Cozzens|1997|p=309}} Grant planned to move south along the Mississippi Central Railroad with 40,000 troops.{{sfn|Boatner|1959|p=871}} As he awaited approval from Union General-in-chief [[Henry Halleck]], Grant began concentrating five divisions at [[Grand Junction, Tennessee]]. When Halleck endorsed the plan and told Grant that 20,000 additional reinforcements were forthcoming, Grant decided to wait for the new troops. However, he sent [[James B. McPherson]] ahead with two divisions. Though a recent prisoner exchange swelled Van Dorn's strength to 24,000 troops, many of his soldiers were in poor health and the onset of cold weather increased the sick list.{{sfn|Cozzens|1997|p=309}} \n\nOn November 9, Van Dorn withdrew from Holly Springs to a new defensive line behind the [[Tallahatchie River]]. On December 1, Grant pressed forward again.{{sfn|Cozzens|1997|p=310}} A Federal force under [[Alvin Peterson Hovey]] steamed down the [[Mississippi River]], landed at [[Greenville, Mississippi]], and marched inland toward the railroad.{{sfn|Atkinson|2018}} Van Dorn retreated behind the [[Yalobusha River]] covering [[Grenada, Mississippi|Grenada]], only {{cvt|120|mi|km|0}} north of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]].{{sfn|Cozzens|1997|p=310}} At this time, Lieutenant Colonel John S. Griffiths of the [[6th Texas Cavalry Regiment]] suggested raiding Grant's supply base at Holly Springs.{{sfn|Bridges|2011}} Pemberton liked the idea and gave Van Dorn three brigades of cavalry to attempt the raid. He assigned Van Dorn's corps to [[Dabney H. Maury]].{{sfn|Cozzens|1997|p=310}}\n\nMeanwhile, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] authorized [[John A. McClernand]] to raise an army in the Midwestern states and lead it in an expedition against Vicksburg. McClernand's program was successful in recruiting large numbers of Union soldiers, which were forwarded to Memphis. The problem was that McClernand's expedition would be operating in a department commanded by Grant, a violation of the principle of [[Unity of command]]. Furthermore, neither Grant nor General-in-chief [[Henry Halleck]] liked McClernand. Halleck told Grant that all troops in the department were his to command. Grant ordered [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] to take the soldiers at Memphis down the Mississippi River, enter the [[Yazoo River]], and assault Vicksburg from the north. On 18 December, Halleck telegraphed Grant that the troops at Memphis were to be organized into two corps, one under McClernand and one under Sherman. Grant notified McClernand at [[Springfield, Illinois]] that he should go to Memphis to take charge of the expedition since he outranked everyone in the department except Grant.

The station was located on Mile End Road in the town centre. The station was opened by the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|NER]] in 1879 as the terminus of their newly extended ''Newcastle and South Shields Railway'' branch from [[Pelaw Metro station|Pelaw]] via [[Hebburn]] and had two platforms and an ornate overall roof.\n\nThe town had been rail-served by some years prior to this - the [[Stanhope and Tyne Railway]] had opened their route from [[Washington, Tyne and Wear|Washington]] back in 1834, whilst the [[Brandling Junction Railway]] followed with a branch from {{rws|Brockley Whins}} five years later.  Both these companies (and the S&T's successor the ''Pontop and South Shields Railway'') had though been purely concerned with mineral traffic and passenger provision was limited.  The new route though was built to carry passengers from the outset as well as coal & iron ore to/from Tyne Dock and had regular services to both {{rws|Newcastle Central}} via {{rws|Gateshead}} and to {{rws|Sunderland}}, these running via the old BJR route via Tyne Dock and {{rws|East Boldon}}.  It also served as the western terminus or the [[South Shields, Marsden, and Whitburn Colliery Railway]] from its opening to public passenger traffic in 1888.\n\nThe [[1923 Grouping]] saw the station pass from the NER into the control of the [[London and North Eastern Railway]].  Services on both routes remained well used and in 1938, the line from Newcastle was electrified on the 660 V [[Direct current|DC]] system as an extension of the existing [[North Tyneside Loop|North Tyneside suburban network]].<ref name = \"SERA\">[http://www.emus.co.uk/zone/tyneside/tyneside.htm SERA History Zone - The Tyneside Electrics] ''Suburban Electric Railway Association'' article; Retrieved 2014-04-10</ref>\n\n[[Nationalisation]] in 1948 saw the station become part of [[British Railways]] North Eastern Region, but over the next few years services began to decline - those to Whitburn Colliery ended in November 1953,<ref>[http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/m/marsden/ \"Disused Stations - Marsden (2nd site)\"] ''Disused Stations''; Retrieved 2014-04-10</ref> whilst the direct Sunderland trains fell victim to the [[Beeching Axe]] in May 1965 (passengers thereafter having to change at Pelaw).  The Newcastle line was also converted to [[diesel multiple unit]] operation in 1963, with BR stating that it was cheaper to remove the third rail than renew the electrical equipment on the route.<ref name = \"SERA\"/>  Though it survived the Beeching cuts, by the 1970s the station (and route) had become increasingly run down and so it was a logical choice to be included in the planned [[Tyne & Wear Metro]] network.<ref>[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/466518 South Shields Station just before closure] Clifton, Neil; ''Geograph.org''; Retrieved 2014-04-10</ref>\n\nIt was eventually closed on 1 June 1981, when the line was temporarily shut down for conversion to Metro operation.  It was replaced by a new [[South Shields Metro station]] a short distance to the south, when the line reopened in 1984. The station building survived as an entrance to the Metro system until the 1990s, when it was demolished.\n\nToday, a Shopmobility centre stands on the site of the original station building.

The station was located on Mile End Road in the town centre. The station was opened by the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|NER]] in 1879 as the terminus of their newly extended ''Newcastle and South Shields Railway'' branch from [[Pelaw Metro station|Pelaw]] via [[Hebburn]] and had two platforms and an ornate overall roof.\n\nThe town had been rail-served by some years prior to this - the [[Stanhope and Tyne Railway]] had opened their route from [[Washington, Tyne and Wear|Washington]] back in 1834, whilst the [[Brandling Junction Railway]] followed with a branch from {{rws|Brockley Whins}} five years later.  Both these companies (and the S&T's successor the ''Pontop and South Shields Railway'') had though been purely concerned with mineral traffic and passenger provision was limited.  The new route though was built to carry passengers from the outset as well as coal & iron ore to/from Tyne Dock and had regular services to both {{rws|Newcastle Central}} via {{rws|Gateshead}} and to {{rws|Sunderland}}, these running via the old BJR route via Tyne Dock and {{rws|East Boldon}}.  It also served as the western terminus or the [[South Shields, Marsden, and Whitburn Colliery Railway]] from its opening to public passenger traffic in 1888.\n\nThe [[1923 Grouping]] saw the station pass from the NER into the control of the [[London and North Eastern Railway]].  Services on both routes remained well used and in 1938, the line from Newcastle was electrified on the 660 V [[Direct current|DC]] system as an extension of the existing [[North Tyneside Loop|North Tyneside suburban network]].<ref name = \"SERA\">[http://www.emus.co.uk/zone/tyneside/tyneside.htm SERA History Zone - The Tyneside Electrics] ''Suburban Electric Railway Association'' article; Retrieved 2014-04-10</ref>\n\n[[Nationalisation]] in 1948 saw the station become part of [[British Railways]] North Eastern Region, but over the next few years services began to decline - those to Whitburn Colliery ended in November 1953,<ref>[http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/m/marsden/ \"Disused Stations - Marsden (2nd site)\"] ''Disused Stations''; Retrieved 2014-04-10</ref> whilst the direct Sunderland trains fell victim to the [[Beeching Axe]] in May 1965 (passengers thereafter having to change at Pelaw).  The Newcastle line was also converted to [[diesel multiple unit]] operation in 1963, with BR stating that it was cheaper to remove the third rail than renew the electrical equipment on the route.<ref name = \"SERA\"/>  Though it survived the Beeching cuts, by the 1970s the station (and route) had become increasingly run down and so it was a logical choice to be included in the planned [[Tyne & Wear Metro]] network.<ref>[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/466518 South Shields Station just before closure] Clifton, Neil; ''Geograph.org''; Retrieved 2014-04-10</ref>\n\nIt was eventually closed on 1 June 1981, when the line was temporarily shut down for conversion to Metro operation.  It was replaced by a new [[South Shields Metro station]] a short distance to the south, when the line reopened in 1984. The station building survived as an entrance to the Metro system until the 1990s, when it was demolished.\n\nToday, a Shopmobility centre stands on the site of the original station building. The new building was built to a similar style as the station it replaced.  The platforms behind have been removed, but the rest of the site is still used by Metro as carriage & engineers' sidings.\n\nIn early 2019 a new interchange opened there which is also a bus terminal. The same tracks are used but the platform has moved.\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.railbrit.co.uk/location.php?loc=South%20Shields RAILSCOT - South Shields]\n\n{{coord|54.9996|-1.4344|type:railwaystation_region:GB|display=title}}\n{{Closed stations Tyne and Wear}}\n\n[[Category:Disused railway stations in Tyne and Wear]]\n[[Category:South Shields|Railway station]]\n[[Category:Railway stations opened in 1879]]\n[[Category:Railway stations closed in 1981]]\n[[Category:Former North Eastern Railway (UK) stations]]\n[[Category:1879 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:1981 disestablishments in England]]\n", "name_user": "MSGJ", "label": "safe", "comment": "refine category", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Shields_railway_station"}
