In Uruguay, charcoal is not used, but instead direct embers or hot coals.\n\nCooking can be done ''al asador'' or ''a la parrilla''. In the first case, a fire is made on the ground or in a fire pit and surrounded by metal crosses (''asadores'') that hold the entire carcass of an animal splayed open to receive the heat from the fire.

Dishes such as ''[[pamplona (meat)|pamplona]]'', pork, and Patagonian lamb are becoming more frequent, particularly in restaurants. An ''asado'' also includes bread, a simple mixed salad of, for instance, lettuce, tomato, and onions, or it could be accompanied with ''verdurajo'' (grilled vegetables), a mixture made of potatoes, corn, onion, and eggplant cooked on the grill and seasoned with olive oil and salt. Beer, wine, soft drink, and other beverages are common. Dessert is usually fresh fruit.\n\n[[File:Plato de lechazo, Valladolid.jpg|thumb|left|''Lechazo asado'' (roast [[lechazo]]), shown above, is a typical dish from [[Spanish cuisine]], as is the similar  ''Cochinillo asado'' ([[Pig roast|roast suckling pig]]).]]\nAnother traditional form to mainly roast the meat, used in Patagonia, is with the whole animal (especially lamb and pork) in a wood stick nailed in the ground and exposed to the heat of live coals, called ''asado al palo''.\n\nThe meat for an ''asado'' is not [[marination|marinate]]d, the only preparation being the application of salt before or during the cooking period.<ref name=rockridge>{{cite web|title=Rockridge Cornucopia: Politics and Food|url=http://www.rockridge.org/news/rockridge-cornucopia-politics-and-food|accessdate=12 June 2015|date=9 June 2013|last1=Kaufman|first1=Barry}}</ref> Also, the heat and distance from the coals are controlled to provide a slow cooking; it usually takes around two hours to cook ''asado''. Further, grease from the meat is not encouraged to fall on the coals and create smoke which would adversely flavour the meat. In some ''asados'' the area directly under the meat is kept clear of coals.\n\nThe ''asado'' is usually placed in a tray to be immediately served, but it can also be placed on a brasero right on the table to keep the meat warm. ''[[Chimichurri]]'', a sauce of chopped parsley, dried oregano, garlic, salt, black pepper, onion, and paprika with olive oil, or ''salsa criolla'', a sauce of tomato and onion in vinegar, are common accompaniments to an ''asado'', where they are traditionally used on the offal, but not the steaks.\n\n===Salad===\nFood is often accompanied by salads, which in ''asado'' gatherings are traditionally made by women on site or brought to the ''asado'' from their homes while the men focus on the meats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vagabundomagazine.com/understanding-the-asado-barbecue-the-argentinian-way/ |title=Understanding the Asado: Barbecue The Argentinian Way |first=Guillermo |last=Astigarraga |date=19 October 2011 |work=Vagabundo Magazine |accessdate=29 December 2012 |quote=Men grill the meat, women make the salad -which is just tomato and lettuce dressed with oil and salt, and maybe a squirt of vinegar; after all, the salad is not the point, it\u2019s all about the meat (look closely at how the different groups function, men in the backyard grilling, women in the kitchen chopping vegetables, all roles predetermined, neither side interested in introducing any variations). |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426042323/http://www.vagabundomagazine.com/understanding-the-asado-barbecue-the-argentinian-way/ |archive-date=26 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Salad Olivier]] (''ensalada rusa'') is one of the most common salads served at ''asados''.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-an-asado.htm |title=What is an Asado? |first=Devon |last=Pryor |work=wiseGEEK |accessdate=29 December 2012 |quote=One is more likely to see an ensalada rusa, made from potato, carrot, green peas, hardboiled eggs, and mayonnaise.}}</ref> In Paraguay [[Chipa Guasu]], [[sopa paraguaya]] and boiled [[cassava|manioc]] as a side dish is also served.\n\n==Variations==\n[[File:Argentinean asado.jpg|thumb|A typical Argentinean ''asado'' assortment consisting of beef, pork, ribs, pork ribs, chitterlings, sweetbread, sausages, blood sausages, and chicken.]]\n\nIn Chile, the normal version ''cordero al palo'' (whole roast lamb) is usually accompanied with ''[[pebre]]'', a local condiment made from [[pur\u00e9e|pureed]] herbs, garlic, and hot peppers; in many ways similar to ''[[chimichurri]]''. The dish is typical of southern Chile and is served hot accompanied by salads. A whole lamb is tied to a spit and is then roasted perpendicular on a wood fire. The preparation lasts around 5 hours since cooking must be constant and on a low heat.\n[[File:Grilling sauages in Montevideo.jpg|thumb|left|Line cooks grilling sausages, asado, and [[offal]] in a market near the port of Montevideo, Uruguay.]]\n[[File:Asado Gral Pico 2.JPG|thumb|left|Asado in Patagonia]]\nIn Brazil, ''asado'' is called ''{{lang|pt|[[churrasco]]}}'', although the cooking is usually faster. Grilled and salted meat in Brazil is generally called \"carne assada\" and is often cut into small strips and served on a plate or cutting board in the middle of the table for all to partake. Various grilled meats, pork, sausages and occasionally chicken are also passed around from table to table on a spit and a slice is offered to each person. This is called \"rodizio\" because each person partakes in turn. Charcoal is predominantly used instead of [[ember]]s of [[wood]], and Brazilians tend to cook the meat on [[skewer]]s or grills. In some places, the meat is seasoned with salt and a little sugar.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nIn Mexico, there is similar tradition of as ''parrilladas'' or ''[[carne asada]]s'', which incorporates various marinated cuts of meat, including steaks, chicken, and sausages (''chorizo'', ''[[longaniza]]'', and ''[[moronga]]'' being especially popular). These are all grilled over wood charcoal. Vegetables are also placed over the grill, especially green onions (''cebollitas''), ''[[nopal]]es'', and corn ([[elote]]'').\n\n[[File:Chulengo.jpg|thumb|A \"chulengo\" is usually an oil barrel cut in half, used to protect the fire and meat from winds]]\nAgain, in Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay, some alternatives are the ''asado al disco'' and ''asado al horno de barro'', especially in the countryside. The recipe doesn't change, only the way of cooking. In the ''asado al disco'' the worn-out disc of a [[plough]] is used. Being metallic and concave, three or four metallic legs are welded and with hot coal or lumber below it is easily transformed into an effective grill. Food is put in a spiral, in such a way that the fat naturally slips to the center, preserving the meat for being fried. [[Bell pepper]]s and onions are usually put next to the edge, so that they gradually release their juices on the meat. The ''asado al horno de barro'' differs from tradition, as an adobe'' [[horno]]'' (oven, called tatakua in Paraguay) is used. These ovens are a common view in Argentine and Paraguayan ''[[estancia]]s''; their primary function is to bake bread, [[Chipa Guasu]] and [[Sopa paraguaya]], but they are well suited for roasting meat. [[Pork]] suckling and, less commonly, [[lamb and mutton|lamb]] are served, as they are more unlikely to become dry.\nAnother way of cooking the asado is inside a ''chulengo'', an oil barrel (or similar) cut in half, inside which the grill is placed to protect both the meat and fire from heavy winds. This makes the ''chulengo'' specially used in the [[Patagonia]], although it's also used in other areas for practicality and the ability to move it around.\n\n==Other dishes==\nSouth American ''asado'' should not to be confused with ''[[Philippine asado|asado]]'' in the [[Philippines]], which refers to two different [[braised]] dishes: ''[[asado de carajay]]'', which is braised meat with vegetables in a savory stew; and [[Philippine asado|pork ''asado'']], which is a sweet braised version of ''{{lang|zh|[[char siu]]}}''. The equivalent of Latin American ''asado'' barbecues in Philippine cuisine would be the various ''inihaw'' dishes (also known as ''sinugba'' or ''inasal'').\n\nIn [[Portugal]], a roasted fish dish served with sausages and bacon is also known as ''[[assado]]''.\n\nIn [[Goa]], roast beef is called ''assad'', from Portuguese ''[[assado]]''.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Food}}\n* [[Argentine cuisine]]\n** [[Argentine beef]]\n* [[List of barbecue dishes]]\n* [[Paraguayan cuisine]]\n* [[Uruguayan cuisine]]\n** [[Cuisine of Montevideo]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Asado}}\n* The Art of Cordero al Palo [https://www.newworlder.com/article/8193/the-art-of-cordero-al-palo]\n{{National emblems of Argentina}}\n{{Barbecue}}\n\n[[Category:Argentine cuisine]]\n[[Category:Barbecue]]\n[[Category:Chilean cuisine]]\n[[Category:Colombian cuisine]]\n[[Category:National symbols of Argentina]]\n[[Category:Uruguayan cuisine]]\n[[Category:National dishes]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Latin-American dish of beef, sausages, and sometimes other meats, cooked on a grill (parrilla) or an open fire}}\n{{For2|the braised dish|[[Philippine asado]]|the roasted fish dish|[[Portuguese assado]]}}\n{{Steak}}\n'''''{{lang|es|Asado}}''''' ({{IPA-es|a\u02c8sa\u00f0o|lang}}) are the techniques and the social event of having or attending a barbecue<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.woz.ch/artikel/2007/nr26/leben/15131.html |title=Jedes Biest auf den Grill |first=Christoph |last=Kuhn |date=28 June 2007 |publisher=WOZ Die Wochenzeitung |location=Zurich |language=German |accessdate=29 December 2012 |quote=Asado heisst eigentlich gegrilltes Fleisch, Braten; das Wort wird heute f\u00fcr das Grillereignis allgemein gebraucht.}}</ref> in various South American countries, where it is also a traditional event.

Dessert is usually fresh fruit.\n\n[[File:Plato de lechazo, Valladolid.jpg|thumb|left|''Lechazo asado'' (roast [[lechazo]]), shown above, is a typical dish from [[Spanish cuisine]], as is the similar  ''Cochinillo asado'' ([[Pig roast|roast suckling pig]]).]]\nAnother traditional form to mainly roast the meat, used in Patagonia, is with the whole animal (especially lamb and pork) in a wood stick nailed in the ground and exposed to the heat of live coals, called ''asado al palo''.\n\nThe meat for an ''asado'' is not [[marination|marinate]]d, the only preparation being the application of salt before or during the cooking period.<ref name=rockridge>{{cite web|title=Rockridge Cornucopia: Politics and Food|url=http://www.rockridge.org/news/rockridge-cornucopia-politics-and-food|accessdate=12 June 2015|date=9 June 2013|last1=Kaufman|first1=Barry}}</ref> Also, the heat and distance from the coals are controlled to provide a slow cooking; it usually takes around two hours to cook ''asado''. Further, grease from the meat is not encouraged to fall on the coals and create smoke which would adversely flavour the meat. In some ''asados'' the area directly under the meat is kept clear of coals.\n\nThe ''asado'' is usually placed in a tray to be immediately served, but it can also be placed on a brasero right on the table to keep the meat warm. ''[[Chimichurri]]'', a sauce of chopped parsley, dried oregano, garlic, salt, black pepper, onion, and paprika with olive oil, or ''salsa criolla'', a sauce of tomato and onion in vinegar, are common accompaniments to an ''asado'', where they are traditionally used on the offal, but not the steaks.\n\n===Salad===\nFood is often accompanied by salads, which in ''asado'' gatherings are traditionally made by women on site or brought to the ''asado'' from their homes while the men focus on the meats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vagabundomagazine.com/understanding-the-asado-barbecue-the-argentinian-way/ |title=Understanding the Asado: Barbecue The Argentinian Way |first=Guillermo |last=Astigarraga |date=19 October 2011 |work=Vagabundo Magazine |accessdate=29 December 2012 |quote=Men grill the meat, women make the salad -which is just tomato and lettuce dressed with oil and salt, and maybe a squirt of vinegar; after all, the salad is not the point, it\u2019s all about the meat (look closely at how the different groups function, men in the backyard grilling, women in the kitchen chopping vegetables, all roles predetermined, neither side interested in introducing any variations). |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426042323/http://www.vagabundomagazine.com/understanding-the-asado-barbecue-the-argentinian-way/ |archive-date=26 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Salad Olivier]] (''ensalada rusa'') is one of the most common salads served at ''asados''.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-an-asado.htm |title=What is an Asado? |first=Devon |last=Pryor |work=wiseGEEK |accessdate=29 December 2012 |quote=One is more likely to see an ensalada rusa, made from potato, carrot, green peas, hardboiled eggs, and mayonnaise.}}</ref> In Paraguay [[Chipa Guasu]], [[sopa paraguaya]] and boiled [[cassava|manioc]] as a side dish is also served.\n\n==Variations==\n[[File:Argentinean asado.jpg|thumb|A typical Argentinean ''asado'' assortment consisting of beef, pork, ribs, pork ribs, chitterlings, sweetbread, sausages, blood sausages, and chicken.]]\n\nIn Chile, the normal version ''cordero al palo'' (whole roast lamb) is usually accompanied with ''[[pebre]]'', a local condiment made from [[pur\u00e9e|pureed]] herbs, garlic, and hot peppers; in many ways similar to ''[[chimichurri]]''. The dish is typical of southern Chile and is served hot accompanied by salads. A whole lamb is tied to a spit and is then roasted perpendicular on a wood fire. The preparation lasts around 5 hours since cooking must be constant and on a low heat.\n[[File:Grilling sauages in Montevideo.jpg|thumb|left|Line cooks grilling sausages, asado, and [[offal]] in a market near the port of Montevideo, Uruguay.]]\n[[File:Asado Gral Pico 2.JPG|thumb|left|Asado in Patagonia]]\nIn Brazil, ''asado'' is called ''{{lang|pt|[[churrasco]]}}'', although the cooking is usually faster. Grilled and salted meat in Brazil is generally called \"carne assada\" and is often cut into small strips and served on a plate or cutting board in the middle of the table for all to partake. Various grilled meats, pork, sausages and occasionally chicken are also passed around from table to table on a spit and a slice is offered to each person. This is called \"rodizio\" because each person partakes in turn. Charcoal is predominantly used instead of [[ember]]s of [[wood]], and Brazilians tend to cook the meat on [[skewer]]s or grills. In some places, the meat is seasoned with salt and a little sugar.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nIn Mexico, there is similar tradition of as ''parrilladas'' or ''[[carne asada]]s'', which incorporates various marinated cuts of meat, including steaks, chicken, and sausages (''chorizo'', ''[[longaniza]]'', and ''[[moronga]]'' being especially popular). These are all grilled over wood charcoal. Vegetables are also placed over the grill, especially green onions (''cebollitas''), ''[[nopal]]es'', and corn ([[elote]]'').\n\n[[File:Chulengo.jpg|thumb|A \"chulengo\" is usually an oil barrel cut in half, used to protect the fire and meat from winds]]\nAgain, in Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay, some alternatives are the ''asado al disco'' and ''asado al horno de barro'', especially in the countryside. The recipe doesn't change, only the way of cooking. In the ''asado al disco'' the worn-out disc of a [[plough]] is used. Being metallic and concave, three or four metallic legs are welded and with hot coal or lumber below it is easily transformed into an effective grill. Food is put in a spiral, in such a way that the fat naturally slips to the center, preserving the meat for being fried. [[Bell pepper]]s and onions are usually put next to the edge, so that they gradually release their juices on the meat. The ''asado al horno de barro'' differs from tradition, as an adobe'' [[horno]]'' (oven, called tatakua in Paraguay) is used. These ovens are a common view in Argentine and Paraguayan ''[[estancia]]s''; their primary function is to bake bread, [[Chipa Guasu]] and [[Sopa paraguaya]], but they are well suited for roasting meat. [[Pork]] suckling and, less commonly, [[lamb and mutton|lamb]] are served, as they are more unlikely to become dry.\nAnother way of cooking the asado is inside a ''chulengo'', an oil barrel (or similar) cut in half, inside which the grill is placed to protect both the meat and fire from heavy winds. This makes the ''chulengo'' specially used in the [[Patagonia]], although it's also used in other areas for practicality and the ability to move it around.\n\n==Other dishes==\nSouth American ''asado'' should not to be confused with ''[[Philippine asado|asado]]'' in the [[Philippines]], which refers to two different [[braised]] dishes: ''[[asado de carajay]]'', which is braised meat with vegetables in a savory stew; and [[Philippine asado|pork ''asado'']], which is a sweet braised version of ''{{lang|zh|[[char siu]]}}''. The equivalent of Latin American ''asado'' barbecues in Philippine cuisine would be the various ''inihaw'' dishes (also known as ''sinugba'' or ''inasal'').\n\nIn [[Portugal]], a roasted fish dish served with sausages and bacon is also known as ''[[assado]]''.\n\nIn [[Goa]], roast beef is called ''assad'', from Portuguese ''[[assado]]''.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Food}}\n* [[Argentine cuisine]]\n** [[Argentine beef]]\n* [[List of barbecue dishes]]\n* [[Paraguayan cuisine]]\n* [[Uruguayan cuisine]]\n** [[Cuisine of Montevideo]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Asado}}\n* The Art of Cordero al Palo [https://www.newworlder.com/article/8193/the-art-of-cordero-al-palo]\n{{National emblems of Argentina}}\n{{Barbecue}}\n\n[[Category:Argentine cuisine]]\n[[Category:Barbecue]]\n[[Category:Chilean cuisine]]\n[[Category:Colombian cuisine]]\n[[Category:National symbols of Argentina]]\n[[Category:Uruguayan cuisine]]\n[[Category:National dishes]]\n", "name_user": "Nihiltres", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Simplified hatnote syntax", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asado"}

It is {{convert|14.8|mi|km}} long and forms part of the connected English/Welsh inland waterway network.\n\n==Route and features==\n\n===General description===\nThe canal consists of two level pounds, separated by a [[Marple Lock Flight|flight of 16 locks]] that raise the canal by {{convert|209|ft}} over the course of {{convert|1|mi}}.\n\nThe two pounds of the canal are generally known as the Upper Peak Forest Canal and Lower Peak Forest Canal. Whilst there is no evidence that these names were used historically, the designation Lower Peak Forest Canal was used in the British Waterways Act 1983, which redesignated the lower part of the canal as a Cruising Waterway.\n\n===Route===\nThe '''Lower Peak Forest Canal''' heads south from [[Dukinfield Junction]] at [[Dukinfield]] in [[Greater Manchester]], where it makes a junction with the [[Ashton Canal]] at the southern end of the [[River Tame, Greater Manchester|Tame Aqueduct]]  ({{gbmapping|SJ934984}}) through [[Newton, Hyde|Newton]], [[Hyde, Greater Manchester|Hyde]], [[Woodley, Greater Manchester|Woodley]], [[Bredbury]], [[Romiley]], before crossing the [[River Goyt]] on [[Marple Aqueduct]], alongside a railway viaduct, to the foot of Marple Locks, a distance of {{convert|6.9|mi}}. The environs are largely rural, passing woods and fields, with some industrial premises encroaching towards the Dukinfield end of the pound.\n\nWhilst the {{convert|1|mi}} section through '''[[Marple Lock Flight|Marple Locks]]''' is legally a part of the Lower Peak Forest Canal it is often considered as a separate section, raising the canal through {{convert|209|ft}} in a partly woodland, partly municipal park and partly urban setting through the centre of Marple, to connect with the [[Macclesfield Canal]] at [[Marple, Greater Manchester|Marple]] junction.\n\nThe '''Upper Peak Forest Canal''' is on the same level as that of the upper [[Macclesfield Canal]], allowing boats to cruise from [[Whaley Bridge]] or [[Bugsworth]] all the way to the top lock at Bosley without having to use a lock. The canal is perched halfway up the valley-side with extensive views of [[Furness Vale]], and the Peak District beyond from Marple through [[Strines]], [[Disley]], [[New Mills]], Furness Vale and [[Bridgemont]]. It terminates at [[Bugsworth Basin]], [[Derbyshire]] ({{gbmapping|SK021820}}), a distance of {{convert|6.9|mi}}. The village was renamed Buxworth in Victorian times. Recently, the extensive basin has been reopened, and is now a popular venue for visiting boats. There is also a short branch from Bridgemont to the centre of Whaley Bridge, once the site of a connection to the [[Cromford and High Peak Railway]], which ran across the Peak District and joined up with the [[Cromford Canal]].\n\n===Cruising rings===\nThe section from Dukinfield Junction to Marple Junction is part of the [[Cheshire Ring]] route.\n\n==History==\n\n===Authorisation===\nThe canal was authorised by Act of Parliament in 1794 and its purpose was to provide an outlet for the vast limestone deposits around [[Dove Holes]]. As Dove Holes is over {{convert|1000|ft|m}} above sea level, the canal was terminated in a basin at [[Buxworth|Bugsworth]] in Derbyshire and the line was continued up to the quarries by means of a gravity-operated feeder tramway, known as the [[Peak Forest Tramway]], which was {{convert|6|mi}} long.\n\n===Construction===\n{{Peak Forest Canal map}}\nThe construction of the canal and tramway was promoted by [[Samuel Oldknow]] (the largest shareholder)<ref>{{Citation |last=Parkinson-Bailey |first=John|title=Manchester: An Architectural History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ush5WC9BM_gC |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=0-7190-5606-3|year=2000}}</ref> with much of the finance being provided by [[Richard Arkwright Junior]] of [[Cromford]], Derbyshire. The line was surveyed by [[Thomas Brown (engineer)|Thomas Brown]] and the consulting engineer and resident engineer were [[Benjamin Outram]] and Thomas Brown, respectively.\n\nWork was begun first on the section between Ashton and Hyde Hall, where new coal-pits were being opened, so as to derive some income as soon as possible. Outram was somewhat delayed by a request from the committee to report on ideas by [[Robert Fulton]] who had been awarded the contract for the cuttings at [[Werneth, Cheshire|Werneth]]. These would have replaced the stone construction of Marple Aqueduct by a somewhat flimsy cast iron trough. Outram, who was experiencing problems with the Holmes Aqueduct on the [[Derby Canal]], was well aware of potential weaknesses. Fulton had also suggested the use of small tub boats rather than conventional narrow boats, and an inclined plane at Marple instead of locks. Outram having privately voiced his disquiet, Fulton's plans were quietly dropped.\n\nAt the same time as Outram was working on the lower end, he came under pressure to make progress on the section Bugsworth to Marple, and Samuel Oldknow's coal-pits and lime kilns. Splitting the work in this way possibly contributed to the \u00a31100 overspend recorded in 1795, though there were problems getting the shareholders to meet their commitments. By 1796 this had risen to \u00a34000, but in August the tramway and the canal opened to Marple.\n\nNevertheless, at the end of 1796, funds from investors were still insufficient to finish the locks and the aqueduct at Marple and Outram was asked to suggest a temporary alternative. He produced two solutions, one to cross the arches of the aqueduct, the other assuming that the arches were unfinished. It was decided not to interfere with the ongoing construction of the aqueduct, so the railway ran from its Marple end to the proposed top lock. The arches of the aqueduct were completed in November 1798\u2014and the workers were given a \"handsome treat\" in celebration\u2014being finally completed towards the end of 1799.\n\nHowever, there was still a great of work to be done at the lower end\u2014the driving of Hyde Bank Tunnel proving a particular problem\u2014and the railway and aqueduct saw little use until the canal finally opened along its full length in 1800.\n\n===Operation===\n[[Image:Bugsworth 058079.jpg|256px|right|thumb|The Gauging Stop Place and Wharfinger's house at Bugsworth Basin]]\nThe upper level of the canal and tramway opened for trade on 31 August 1796 and [[Bugsworth Basin]] soon became a bustling interchange between the tramway and canal.\n\nBrown and Outram's efforts were much assisted by the appointment of Gernan Wheatcroft to manage the canal at Bugsworth and Whaley Bridge. He proved so efficient that he was able to use the threat of resignation to gain the addition of \u00a330 to his \u00a375 a year salary to keep and maintain a horse to assist him in his duties. In a move that would not disgrace a modern marketing organisation, the quarry owners retained Outram's future father-in-law, Dr. James Anderson, the Scottish agricultural expert, to write a treatise on the benefits of lime in farming, which they published.\n\nTrade increased rapidly and it was becoming necessary to double the railways. Attracting suitable labour was also a problem. Cottages were rented to convert into dormitories, and Wheatcroft opened a shop where goods could be purchased cheaply. At one point, the employers offered \"a good flannel waistcoat and trousers\" for each worker, plus a jug of ale each day.\n\nThe Marple railway was still a serious bottleneck. The canal company still lacked funds to complete the Marple locks and the [[Combs Reservoir]] that would be necessary. A petition to Parliament was considered but, finally, \u00a324,000 was borrowed from [[Samuel Oldknow]] and Arkwright and the work was completed in 1805.\n\nAt Bugsworth, limestone brought down the tramway was either put into boats to be taken to [[Manchester]] and beyond or it was put into lime kilns to be burnt to produce [[Calcium oxide|quick lime]]. The trade in limestone and quick lime (also known as burnt lime), as well as the transport of coal into the basin for firing the kilns, accounted for the greatest proportion of the Canal Company's income.\n\n===Decline===\nWith the coming of the railways, the canal began to lose its business and in the 1920s the Peak Forest Tramway and Bugsworth Basin closed. Later, the lower level of the canal and Marple locks fell into disuse, to the extent that by the early 1960s the lower part of the canal was impassable.\n\n===Restoration===\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Peak Forest Canal Society and the [[Inland Waterways Association]] campaigned for the restoration of the Peak Forest and Ashton Canals, and they reopened on 1 April 1974. The Lower Peak Forest Canal, from Dukinfield Junction to Marple, was one of seven stretches of canal formally designated as remainder waterways that were re-classified by the British Waterways Act of 8 February 1983. Under the act, a total of 82 route miles (132&nbsp;km) were upgraded to Cruising Waterway Standard.<ref>{{cite book |first=Lewis A. |last=Edwards |date=1985 |title=Inland Waterways of Great Britain |edition=6th |publisher=Imray, Laurie, Norie & Wilson |isbn=0-85288-081-2}}</ref>\n\nBugsworth Basin remained derelict for much longer, but was the subject of long-term restoration attempts by the Inland Waterways Protection Society. It was finally re-opened to navigation in 2003 after professional restoration work was undertaken by [[British Waterways]].\n\n{{Commons category|Peak Forest Canal}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United Kingdom|Transport}}\n*[[Narrowboat]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Schofield, R.B., (2000) ''Benjamin Outram,'' Cardiff: Merton Priory Press\n* Ripley, D., (1989) \"The Peak Forest Tramway including the Peak Forest Canal\" Oakwood Press\n*\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Attached KML|display=title,inline}}\n*[http://www.penninewaterways.co.uk/peak/ Virtual Tour]\n*[http://www.trafalgarmarineservices.co.uk/static/41/peak-forest-canal/ Peak Forest Canal Map]\n{{Canals of Britain}}\n\n{{Alt text missing|England }}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2011}}\n\n[[Category:Canals in England]]\n[[Category:Canals opened in 1796]]\n[[Category:Canals in Cheshire]]\n[[Category:Canals in Derbyshire]]\n[[Category:Canals in Manchester]]\n[[Category:Canals in the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport]]\n[[Category:Canals in Tameside]]\n[[Category:Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway]]\n[[Category:1796 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:New Mills]]\n[[Category:Marple, Greater Manchester]]\n[[Category:Whaley Bridge]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Canal\n  |name        = Peak Forest Canal\n  |image       = Horseboat Maria.jpg\n  |image_caption     = Horseboat ''Maria'' Descending Lock 9 on the Peak Forest Canal\n  |original_owner     = Peak Forest Canal Company\n  |engineer    = [[Benjamin Outram]]\n  |other_engineer  = [[Thomas Brown (engineer)|Thomas Brown]]\n  |date_act    = 1794\n  |date_began  = 1794\n  |date_use    = August 1796\n  |date_completed   = 1805\n  |date_closed = Impassable by early 1960s\n  |date_restored   = 1974\n  |len_ft         = 72\n  |beam_ft        = 7\n  |start_point       = [[Dukinfield Junction]], [[Ashton-under-Lyne]]\n  |end_point         = [[Bugsworth Basin]], [[Buxworth]]\n  |branch      = [[Whaley Bridge]] Branch\n  |connects_to        = [[Ashton Canal]]<br />[[Macclesfield Canal]]\n  |locks       = 16\n  |length_mi      = 14.8\n  |status      = Navigable\n  |navigation_authority         = [[Canal & River Trust]]\n}}\nThe '''Peak Forest Canal''' is a narrow ({{convert|7|ft|m|sigfig=3|adj=on}} gauge) locked artificial waterway in northern [[England]].

Later, the lower level of the canal and Marple locks fell into disuse, to the extent that by the early 1960s the lower part of the canal was impassable.\n\n===Restoration===\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Peak Forest Canal Society and the [[Inland Waterways Association]] campaigned for the restoration of the Peak Forest and Ashton Canals, and they reopened on 1 April 1974. The Lower Peak Forest Canal, from Dukinfield Junction to Marple, was one of seven stretches of canal formally designated as remainder waterways that were re-classified by the British Waterways Act of 8 February 1983. Under the act, a total of 82 route miles (132&nbsp;km) were upgraded to Cruising Waterway Standard.<ref>{{cite book |first=Lewis A. |last=Edwards |date=1985 |title=Inland Waterways of Great Britain |edition=6th |publisher=Imray, Laurie, Norie & Wilson |isbn=0-85288-081-2}}</ref>\n\nBugsworth Basin remained derelict for much longer, but was the subject of long-term restoration attempts by the Inland Waterways Protection Society. It was finally re-opened to navigation in 2003 after professional restoration work was undertaken by [[British Waterways]].\n\n{{Commons category|Peak Forest Canal}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United Kingdom|Transport}}\n*[[Narrowboat]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Schofield, R.B., (2000) ''Benjamin Outram,'' Cardiff: Merton Priory Press\n* Ripley, D., (1989) \"The Peak Forest Tramway including the Peak Forest Canal\" Oakwood Press\n*\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Attached KML|display=title,inline}}\n*[http://www.penninewaterways.co.uk/peak/ Virtual Tour]\n*[http://www.trafalgarmarineservices.co.uk/static/41/peak-forest-canal/ Peak Forest Canal Map]\n{{Canals of Britain}}\n\n{{Alt text missing|England }}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2011}}\n\n[[Category:Canals in England]]\n[[Category:Canals opened in 1796]]\n[[Category:Canals in Cheshire]]\n[[Category:Canals in Derbyshire]]\n[[Category:Canals in Manchester]]\n[[Category:Canals in the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport]]\n[[Category:Canals in Tameside]]\n[[Category:Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway]]\n[[Category:1796 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:New Mills]]\n[[Category:Marple, Greater Manchester]]\n[[Category:Whaley Bridge]]\n", "name_user": "Douglal", "label": "safe", "comment": "Link to Combs Reservoir", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_Forest_Canal"}

The series premiered on [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] on June 3, 2007 and ran for seven seasons, ending on June 9, 2013. The show had the largest series premiere in Lifetime's 23-year history, and the largest viewership in the 10:00 pm to 11:00 pm time slot since December 2007 for Lifetime.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN0626629620070606|title=\"Wives\" bow scores ratings of a Lifetime|date=2007-06-06|publisher=reuters.com|accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref> It received favorable reviews and several award nominations, and won five [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] Awards and one [[Gracie Awards|Gracie Allen Award]].\n\nOn September 21, 2012, the show was picked up for a thirteen-episode seventh season to air in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mitovich|first=Matt Webb|title=Army Wives Is Renewed \u2014 But Who Will Return?|url=http://tvline.com/2012/09/21/army-wives-renewed-season-7/|work=[[TVLine]]|accessdate=December 27, 2012|date=September 21, 2012}}</ref> In November 2012, it was confirmed that season 6 main cast members [[Catherine Bell (actress)|Catherine Bell]], [[Wendy Davis (actress)|Wendy Davis]], [[Terry Serpico]], [[Brian McNamara]], [[Kelli Williams]], [[Alyssa Diaz]], and [[Joseph Julian Soria]] would return as regulars.

The show itself is filmed in various locations such as the Charleston Air Force Base (now [[Charleston Field]]) and the sound stage off Dorchester Road in the City of [[North Charleston, South Carolina|North Charleston]]. Some scenes have been shot in and around the City of Charleston. In Season 5 the 23rd is disbanded and the 32nd Airborne Division becomes the new resident unit, having moved to Fort Marshall from the fictional Fort Hope. The 23rd Airborne Division, XVII Airborne Corps and Fort Marshall are presumably based on the actual [[82nd Airborne Division (United States)|82nd Airborne Division]], [[XVIII Airborne Corps (United States)|XVIII Airborne Corps]] based at [[Fort Bragg]], home of the airborne divisions and the [[United States Army Special Operations Command]]. In Season 7 Fort Marshall was merged with an Air Force base, mirroring the mergers of several Army posts with nearby Air Force bases as a result of the [[2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission]]. Mercer Army Medical Center is the fictional hospital on post where some of the characters worked.\n\nIn the pilot episode of ''Army Wives'', \"A Tribe is Born\", Roxy ([[Sally Pressman]]) accepts the marriage proposal of [[Private First Class]] Trevor LeBlanc ([[Drew Fuller]]) after dating for less than a week, and moves with her two children to his Army post. Floundering in her new life as an Army wife, she takes a job as a bartender at a local joint known for being a [[wiktionary:Jody|Jody]] bar (where [[civilian]] men go to hit on enlisted men's wives). While on the post, Roxy meets Claudia Joy Holden ([[Kim Delaney]]), who believes that her husband [[Colonel (United States)|Col.]] Michael Holden ([[Brian McNamara]]) recently missed out on a promotion because of base [[politics]]. Another Army wife, Pamela Moran ([[Brigid Brannagh]]), is pregnant with twins; she is secretly acting as a [[surrogacy|surrogate]] to get her family out of debt. Pamela's husband Chase ([[Jeremy Davidson (actor)|Jeremy Davidson]]) is a [[non-commissioned officer]] assigned to the highly secretive and frequently deployed special operations unit [[Delta Force]]. Meanwhile, [[psychiatrist]] Roland Burton ([[Sterling K. Brown]]) is trying to reconnect with his wife, [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Joan Burton ([[Wendy Davis (actress)|Wendy Davis]]), who has just returned from [[Afghanistan]]. Denise Sherwood ([[Catherine Bell (actress)|Catherine Bell]]), a long-time friend of Claudia Joy, is dealing with her son Jeremy's anger issues, and her strict husband, [[Major (United States)|Major]] Frank Sherwood ([[Terry Serpico]]), is about to be deployed. The unlikely group bonds when Pamela unexpectedly goes into labor at Claudia Joy's wives' tea party, and subsequently gives birth on the pool table in the bar where Roxy works. Not wanting everyone to know her family's dire financial situation, Pamela relies on these new friends to keep her surrogacy from being exposed.\n\nAs the first season progresses, the four women and Roland all become close friends. Along with their spouses and other characters they face issues such as [[Military deployment|deployments]], abuse, hostage situations, adultery, post-traumatic stress disorder, death and loss of friends and loved ones in combat, homophobia in the military, financial problems, and alcohol and prescription drug addiction.\n\nThough the show is based on the book of the same name, and some of the characters echo their book counterparts, significant differences exist. For example, in the book, Andrea Lynn Cory (the basis of Claudia Joy) loses her husband in a helicopter crash during a mission to find the remains of soldiers in [[Vietnam]].<ref name=\"awbook-vietnammission\">Google Books, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9IofY_hDo2cC&pg=PA99&lpg=PA99&dq=tanya+biank+mission+vietnam&source=bl&ots=IGC_ulDYj2&sig=iTjKGBsTgZ1oHgONBUP9hZapNso&hl=en&ei=i70vTryRL4yitgfWr_ijCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false Army Wives: The Unwritten Code of Military Marriage, page 99] Retrieved 2011-07-27.</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of Army Wives characters}}\n\n===Main cast and characters===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Actor\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Character\n! colspan=\"7\"|Seasons\n|-\n! style=\"width:7%;\"|[[Army Wives (season 1)|1]]\n! style=\"width:7%;\"|[[Army Wives (season 2)|2]]\n! style=\"width:7%;\"|[[Army Wives (season 3)|3]]\n! style=\"width:7%;\"|[[Army Wives (season 4)|4]]\n! style=\"width:7%;\"|[[Army Wives (season 5)|5]]\n! style=\"width:7%;\"|[[Army Wives (season 6)|6]]\n! style=\"width:7%;\"|[[Army Wives (season 7)|7]]\n|-\n| [[Drew Fuller]]\n| [[Trevor LeBlanc|2nd Lieutenant Trevor LeBlanc]]\n| colspan=\"6\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{no2|'''Special Guest'''}}\n|-\n| [[Jeremy Davidson (actor)|Jeremy Davidson]]\n| MSG Chase Moran\n| colspan=\"6\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{no2|'''Special Guest'''}}\n|- \n| [[Terry Serpico]]  \n| Colonel Frank Sherwood \n| colspan=\"1\" {{no2|'''Recurring'''}}\n| colspan=\"6\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|- \n| [[Brian McNamara]]\n| [[Michael Holden (character)|Lt.

The show itself is filmed in various locations such as the Charleston Air Force Base (now [[Charleston Field]]) and the sound stage off Dorchester Road in the City of [[North Charleston, South Carolina|North Charleston]]. Some scenes have been shot in and around the City of Charleston. In Season 5 the 23rd is disbanded and the 32nd Airborne Division becomes the new resident unit, having moved to Fort Marshall from the fictional Fort Hope. The 23rd Airborne Division, XVII Airborne Corps and Fort Marshall are presumably based on the actual [[82nd Airborne Division (United States)|82nd Airborne Division]], [[XVIII Airborne Corps (United States)|XVIII Airborne Corps]] based at [[Fort Bragg]], home of the airborne divisions and the [[United States Army Special Operations Command]]. In Season 7 Fort Marshall was merged with an Air Force base, mirroring the mergers of several Army posts with nearby Air Force bases as a result of the [[2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission]]. Mercer Army Medical Center is the fictional hospital on post where some of the characters worked.\n\nIn the pilot episode of ''Army Wives'', \"A Tribe is Born\", Roxy ([[Sally Pressman]]) accepts the marriage proposal of [[Private First Class]] Trevor LeBlanc ([[Drew Fuller]]) after dating for less than a week, and moves with her two children to his Army post. Floundering in her new life as an Army wife, she takes a job as a bartender at a local joint known for being a [[wiktionary:Jody|Jody]] bar (where [[civilian]] men go to hit on enlisted men's wives). While on the post, Roxy meets Claudia Joy Holden ([[Kim Delaney]]), who believes that her husband [[Colonel (United States)|Col.]] Michael Holden ([[Brian McNamara]]) recently missed out on a promotion because of base [[politics]]. Another Army wife, Pamela Moran ([[Brigid Brannagh]]), is pregnant with twins; she is secretly acting as a [[surrogacy|surrogate]] to get her family out of debt. Pamela's husband Chase ([[Jeremy Davidson (actor)|Jeremy Davidson]]) is a [[non-commissioned officer]] assigned to the highly secretive and frequently deployed special operations unit [[Delta Force]]. Meanwhile, [[psychiatrist]] Roland Burton ([[Sterling K. Brown]]) is trying to reconnect with his wife, [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Joan Burton ([[Wendy Davis (actress)|Wendy Davis]]), who has just returned from [[Afghanistan]]. Denise Sherwood ([[Catherine Bell (actress)|Catherine Bell]]), a long-time friend of Claudia Joy, is dealing with her son Jeremy's anger issues, and her strict husband, [[Major (United States)|Major]] Frank Sherwood ([[Terry Serpico]]), is about to be deployed. The unlikely group bonds when Pamela unexpectedly goes into labor at Claudia Joy's wives' tea party, and subsequently gives birth on the pool table in the bar where Roxy works. Not wanting everyone to know her family's dire financial situation, Pamela relies on these new friends to keep her surrogacy from being exposed.\n\nAs the first season progresses, the four women and Roland all become close friends. Along with their spouses and other characters they face issues such as [[Military deployment|deployments]], abuse, hostage situations, adultery, post-traumatic stress disorder, death and loss of friends and loved ones in combat, homophobia in the military, financial problems, and alcohol and prescription drug addiction.\n\nThough the show is based on the book of the same name, and some of the characters echo their book counterparts, significant differences exist. For example, in the book, Andrea Lynn Cory (the basis of Claudia Joy) loses her husband in a helicopter crash during a mission to find the remains of soldiers in [[Vietnam]].<ref name=\"awbook-vietnammission\">Google Books, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9IofY_hDo2cC&pg=PA99&lpg=PA99&dq=tanya+biank+mission+vietnam&source=bl&ots=IGC_ulDYj2&sig=iTjKGBsTgZ1oHgONBUP9hZapNso&hl=en&ei=i70vTryRL4yitgfWr_ijCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false Army Wives: The Unwritten Code of Military Marriage, page 99] Retrieved 2011-07-27.</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of Army Wives characters}}\n\n===Main cast and characters===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Actor\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Character\n! colspan=\"7\"|Seasons\n|-\n! style=\"width:7%;\"|[[Army Wives (season 1)|1]]\n! style=\"width:7%;\"|[[Army Wives (season 2)|2]]\n! style=\"width:7%;\"|[[Army Wives (season 3)|3]]\n! style=\"width:7%;\"|[[Army Wives (season 4)|4]]\n! style=\"width:7%;\"|[[Army Wives (season 5)|5]]\n! style=\"width:7%;\"|[[Army Wives (season 6)|6]]\n! style=\"width:7%;\"|[[Army Wives (season 7)|7]]\n|-\n| [[Drew Fuller]]\n| [[Trevor LeBlanc|2nd Lieutenant Trevor LeBlanc]]\n| colspan=\"6\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{no2|'''Special Guest'''}}\n|-\n| [[Jeremy Davidson (actor)|Jeremy Davidson]]\n| MSG Chase Moran\n| colspan=\"6\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{no2|'''Special Guest'''}}\n|- \n| [[Terry Serpico]]  \n| Colonel Frank Sherwood \n| colspan=\"1\" {{no2|'''Recurring'''}}\n| colspan=\"6\" {{yes2|'''Main'''}}\n|- \n| [[Brian McNamara]]\n| [[Michael Holden (character)|Lt.

The oldest models were found in Malta, such as at [[Tarxien Temples]], and are now at the archaeology museum in Valletta.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Daniel Cilia|date=2004|first=Anthony|last=Pace|chapter=Tarxien|title=Malta before History \u2013 The World's Oldest Free Standing Stone Architecture|publisher=Miranda Publishers|pages=|isbn=978-9990985085}}</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\n[[File:Pn-ushomirsky-1986-1.jpg|thumb|right|Project managers discuss the plant development using an architectural model]]\n\nArchitectural models are used by architects for a range of purposes:\n* [[Ad hoc]] models, or sketch models, are sometimes made to study the interaction of volumes, different viewpoints, or concepts during the design process. They may also be useful in explaining a complicated or unusual design to builders, or as a focus for discussion between designers and consultants such as architects, engineers and town planners.\n* Presentation models can be used to exhibit, visualise or sell a final design. A model are also used as show pieces, for instance as a feature in the reception of a building, or as part of a museum exhibition such as scale replicas of historical buildings.\n\nTypes of models include:\n* Exterior models are models of buildings which usually include some landscaping or civic spaces around the building.\n* Interior models are models showing interior space planning, finishes, colors, furniture and beautification.\n* Landscaping design models are models of landscape design and development representing features such as walkways, small bridges, pergolas, vegetation patterns and beautification. Landscaping design models usually represent public spaces and may, in some cases, include buildings as well.\n* Urban models are models typically built at a much smaller scale (starting from 1:500 and less, 1:700, 1:1000, 1:1200, 1:2000, 1:20 000), representing several city blocks, even a whole town or village, large resort, campus, industrial facility, military base and so on. Urban models are a vital tool for town/city planning and development. Urban models of large urban areas are displayed at museums such as the [[Shanghai Urban Planning Exhibition Center]], [[Queens Museum]] in New York, the [[Beijing Planning Exhibition Hall]], and the [[Singapore City Gallery]].\n* Engineering and construction models show isolated building/structure elements and components and their interaction.\n<gallery>\nImage:Truman71-381.jpg|A model by architect [[Lorenzo Winslow]] which he used to explore the structure of the [[Grand Staircase (White House)|Grand Staircase]] at the [[White House]] for his redesign of the [[East Wing]].\nImage:Auckland Museum Model Stage II.jpg|Model of a museum building.\nImage:Architectural model condo interior.jpg|Model of a building interior.\nImage:1.150 Capitol Theatre Hong Kong.jpg|A scale replica model of the demolished Capitol Theatre in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong\nFile:W-latblada.1.JPG|A model used for urban planning in the [[Buenos Aires Province]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Virtual modeling==\nBuildings are increasingly designed in software with CAD ([[computer-aided design]]) systems. Early virtual modelling involved the fixing of arbitrary lines and points in virtual space, mainly to produce technical drawings. Modern packages include advanced features such as databases of components, automated engineering calculations, visual fly-throughs, dynamic reflections, and accurate textures and colours.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.MoHinh.VN/ |title=What is Architectural Visualisation? |website=Flying 3D |access-date=18 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.MoHinh.VN |title=What is Accurate Visual Representation? |website=Flying 3D |access-date=18 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nAs an extension to CAD (computer-aided design) and BIM ([[building information modeling |building information modelling]]), virtual reality architectural sessions are also being adopted at increasingly faster rates. As this technology enables participants to be immersed in a 1:1 scale model, essentially experiencing the building before it is even being built.\n\n==Materials==\nRough study models can be made quickly using cardboard, wooden blocks, polystyrene, foam, foam boards and other materials. Such models are an efficient [[design tool]] for three-dimensional understanding of a structure, space or form, used by architects, interior designers and exhibit designers.\n\nCommon materials used for centuries in architectural model building were card stock, [[balsa wood]], [[basswood]] and other woods. Modern professional architectural model builders are taking advantage of twenty-first century materials, such as [[Taskboard]] (a flexible and lightweight wood/fiber board), plastics, wooden and wooden-plastic composites, foams, [[foamcore|foam board]] and urethane compounds.\n \nA number of companies produce ready-made pieces for structural components (e.g. girders, beams), siding, furniture, figures (people), vehicles, trees, bushes and other features which are found in the models. Features such as vehicles, people figurines, trees, street lights and other are called \"scenery elements\" and serve not only to beautify the model, but also to help the observer to obtain a correct feel of scale and proportions represented by the model.\n\nIncreasingly, [[rapid prototyping]] techniques such as [[3D printing]] and [[CNC router|CNC routing]] are used to automatically construct models straight from [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] plans.<ref>{{cite journal | author1 = Ian Gibson | author2 = Thomas Kvan | author3 = Ling Wai Ming | date = 2002 | title = Rapid prototyping for architectural models |  journal = Rapid Prototyping Journal | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 91\u201395 | doi = 10.1108/13552540210420961| url = http://cumincad.architexturez.net//doc/oai-cumincadworks-id-8ec5 }}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Pottery tower 6.JPG|An [[earthenware]] model of two residential towers, made during the [[Han Dynasty]] in China.\nImage:House Model.JPG| Paper architectural models of  a [[bungalow]], [[office]] and  [[house]].\nImage:Royal Military College of Canada model.jpg|A wooden exterior model of the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] grounds.\nImage:Bundesarchiv_Bild_146-1986-029-02,_%22Germania%22,_Modell_%22Gro%C3%9Fe_Halle%22.jpg|Painted wood model of the ''[[Volkshalle]]'' in [[Hitler]]'s planned ''[[Germania (city)|Germania]]'' project.\n</gallery>\n\n===Cork models===\n\nA cork model is an architectural model made predominantly of cork. The art of cork modelling is also called phelloplasty (Greek \u03c6\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2 phellos, cork).\n\nCork was already used in the 16th century in Naples to make Christmas cribs. Crib making became extremely popular there in the 18th and early 19th centuries. \n\nThe invention of architectural models made of cork was (self-)attributed to Augusto Rosa (1738-1784) but Giovanni Altieri (documented 1766/67-1790) and above all Antonio Chichi (1743-1816, https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tempel_des_Portunus_Gotha.JPG) were already active in Rome as manufacturers of cork models. \n\nChichi's models were copied with great success by Carl May (1747-1822, https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_May) and his son Georg Heinrich May (1790\u20131853). \n\nOther artists can be mentioned like Luigi Carotti (Rome), Carlo Lucangeli (1747-1812, Rome, Naples), Domenico Padiglione and his sons Agostino and Felice (Naples) and Auguste Pelet (1785-1865, N\u00eemes). In Marseille,  several scale models were made representing archaeological digs by Hippolyte Augier (1830-1889) ([[Marseille History Museum]] /  Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Histoire de Marseille) or Stanislas Clastrier (1857-1925, https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislas_Clastrier).\n\nDieter C\u00f6llen is a contemporary phelloplastic.\n\n====Collections====\n\nMany cork models of classical monuments in Italy were made and sold to tourists during their [[Grand Tour]]. Cork, especially when carefully painted, was ideal to reproduce the weathered look of wall surfaces. \n\nAs a rule, they were produced on a large scale (the [[Colosseum]] in Aschaffenburg is three metres long and one metre high) and with great, almost scientific precision. \n\nCork models were highly esteemed in the princely courts of the 18th century.

Soane in London, who turned his home into a museum, [[Sir John Soane's Museum]], housing a collection of 14 models in cork of Roman and Greek buildings.\n\nChichi's cork models can be found at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] in St. Petersburg (34 models made around 1774); [[Schloss Wilhelmsh\u00f6he]], Kassel (33 models made 1777-1782); [[Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt]] (26 models acquired 1790/91); and the [[Herzogliches Museum Gotha]] (12 models, acquired after 1777/78.

The oldest models were found in Malta, such as at [[Tarxien Temples]], and are now at the archaeology museum in Valletta.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Daniel Cilia|date=2004|first=Anthony|last=Pace|chapter=Tarxien|title=Malta before History \u2013 The World's Oldest Free Standing Stone Architecture|publisher=Miranda Publishers|pages=|isbn=978-9990985085}}</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\n[[File:Pn-ushomirsky-1986-1.jpg|thumb|right|Project managers discuss the plant development using an architectural model]]\n\nArchitectural models are used by architects for a range of purposes:\n* [[Ad hoc]] models, or sketch models, are sometimes made to study the interaction of volumes, different viewpoints, or concepts during the design process. They may also be useful in explaining a complicated or unusual design to builders, or as a focus for discussion between designers and consultants such as architects, engineers and town planners.\n* Presentation models can be used to exhibit, visualise or sell a final design. A model are also used as show pieces, for instance as a feature in the reception of a building, or as part of a museum exhibition such as scale replicas of historical buildings.\n\nTypes of models include:\n* Exterior models are models of buildings which usually include some landscaping or civic spaces around the building.\n* Interior models are models showing interior space planning, finishes, colors, furniture and beautification.\n* Landscaping design models are models of landscape design and development representing features such as walkways, small bridges, pergolas, vegetation patterns and beautification. Landscaping design models usually represent public spaces and may, in some cases, include buildings as well.\n* Urban models are models typically built at a much smaller scale (starting from 1:500 and less, 1:700, 1:1000, 1:1200, 1:2000, 1:20 000), representing several city blocks, even a whole town or village, large resort, campus, industrial facility, military base and so on. Urban models are a vital tool for town/city planning and development. Urban models of large urban areas are displayed at museums such as the [[Shanghai Urban Planning Exhibition Center]], [[Queens Museum]] in New York, the [[Beijing Planning Exhibition Hall]], and the [[Singapore City Gallery]].\n* Engineering and construction models show isolated building/structure elements and components and their interaction.\n<gallery>\nImage:Truman71-381.jpg|A model by architect [[Lorenzo Winslow]] which he used to explore the structure of the [[Grand Staircase (White House)|Grand Staircase]] at the [[White House]] for his redesign of the [[East Wing]].\nImage:Auckland Museum Model Stage II.jpg|Model of a museum building.\nImage:Architectural model condo interior.jpg|Model of a building interior.\nImage:1.150 Capitol Theatre Hong Kong.jpg|A scale replica model of the demolished Capitol Theatre in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong\nFile:W-latblada.1.JPG|A model used for urban planning in the [[Buenos Aires Province]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Virtual modeling==\nBuildings are increasingly designed in software with CAD ([[computer-aided design]]) systems. Early virtual modelling involved the fixing of arbitrary lines and points in virtual space, mainly to produce technical drawings. Modern packages include advanced features such as databases of components, automated engineering calculations, visual fly-throughs, dynamic reflections, and accurate textures and colours.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.MoHinh.VN/ |title=What is Architectural Visualisation? |website=Flying 3D |access-date=18 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.MoHinh.VN |title=What is Accurate Visual Representation? |website=Flying 3D |access-date=18 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nAs an extension to CAD (computer-aided design) and BIM ([[building information modeling |building information modelling]]), virtual reality architectural sessions are also being adopted at increasingly faster rates. As this technology enables participants to be immersed in a 1:1 scale model, essentially experiencing the building before it is even being built.\n\n==Materials==\nRough study models can be made quickly using cardboard, wooden blocks, polystyrene, foam, foam boards and other materials. Such models are an efficient [[design tool]] for three-dimensional understanding of a structure, space or form, used by architects, interior designers and exhibit designers.\n\nCommon materials used for centuries in architectural model building were card stock, [[balsa wood]], [[basswood]] and other woods. Modern professional architectural model builders are taking advantage of twenty-first century materials, such as [[Taskboard]] (a flexible and lightweight wood/fiber board), plastics, wooden and wooden-plastic composites, foams, [[foamcore|foam board]] and urethane compounds.\n \nA number of companies produce ready-made pieces for structural components (e.g. girders, beams), siding, furniture, figures (people), vehicles, trees, bushes and other features which are found in the models. Features such as vehicles, people figurines, trees, street lights and other are called \"scenery elements\" and serve not only to beautify the model, but also to help the observer to obtain a correct feel of scale and proportions represented by the model.\n\nIncreasingly, [[rapid prototyping]] techniques such as [[3D printing]] and [[CNC router|CNC routing]] are used to automatically construct models straight from [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] plans.<ref>{{cite journal | author1 = Ian Gibson | author2 = Thomas Kvan | author3 = Ling Wai Ming | date = 2002 | title = Rapid prototyping for architectural models |  journal = Rapid Prototyping Journal | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 91\u201395 | doi = 10.1108/13552540210420961| url = http://cumincad.architexturez.net//doc/oai-cumincadworks-id-8ec5 }}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Pottery tower 6.JPG|An [[earthenware]] model of two residential towers, made during the [[Han Dynasty]] in China.\nImage:House Model.JPG| Paper architectural models of  a [[bungalow]], [[office]] and  [[house]].\nImage:Royal Military College of Canada model.jpg|A wooden exterior model of the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] grounds.\nImage:Bundesarchiv_Bild_146-1986-029-02,_%22Germania%22,_Modell_%22Gro%C3%9Fe_Halle%22.jpg|Painted wood model of the ''[[Volkshalle]]'' in [[Hitler]]'s planned ''[[Germania (city)|Germania]]'' project.\n</gallery>\n\n===Cork models===\n\nA cork model is an architectural model made predominantly of cork. The art of cork modelling is also called phelloplasty (Greek \u03c6\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2 phellos, cork).\n\nCork was already used in the 16th century in Naples to make Christmas cribs. Crib making became extremely popular there in the 18th and early 19th centuries. \n\nThe invention of architectural models made of cork was (self-)attributed to Augusto Rosa (1738-1784) but Giovanni Altieri (documented 1766/67-1790) and above all Antonio Chichi (1743-1816, https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tempel_des_Portunus_Gotha.JPG) were already active in Rome as manufacturers of cork models. \n\nChichi's models were copied with great success by Carl May (1747-1822, https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_May) and his son Georg Heinrich May (1790\u20131853). \n\nOther artists can be mentioned like Luigi Carotti (Rome), Carlo Lucangeli (1747-1812, Rome, Naples), Domenico Padiglione and his sons Agostino and Felice (Naples) and Auguste Pelet (1785-1865, N\u00eemes). In Marseille,  several scale models were made representing archaeological digs by Hippolyte Augier (1830-1889) ([[Marseille History Museum]] /  Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Histoire de Marseille) or Stanislas Clastrier (1857-1925, https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislas_Clastrier).\n\nDieter C\u00f6llen is a contemporary phelloplastic.\n\n====Collections====\n\nMany cork models of classical monuments in Italy were made and sold to tourists during their [[Grand Tour]]. Cork, especially when carefully painted, was ideal to reproduce the weathered look of wall surfaces. \n\nAs a rule, they were produced on a large scale (the [[Colosseum]] in Aschaffenburg is three metres long and one metre high) and with great, almost scientific precision. \n\nCork models were highly esteemed in the princely courts of the 18th century. They were also acquired for their scientific value by schools of architecture in the late 18th/early 19th century, or institutions like the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]] and the [[British Museum]] thus introducing the general public to ancient architecture. \n\nDespite their fragility, cork models have often survived better than wooden models threatened by wood-destroying insects.\n\nApart from kings and princes, cork models were collected by people such as [[Filippo Farsetti]] (1703-1774) in Venice, [[Pierre Gaspard Marie Grimod d'Orsay]] (1748-1809) or the architect [[Louis-Fran\u00e7ois  Cassas]] in France, [[Charles Townley]] or  Sir J. Soane in London, who turned his home into a museum, [[Sir John Soane's Museum]], housing a collection of 14 models in cork of Roman and Greek buildings.\n\nChichi's cork models can be found at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] in St. Petersburg (34 models made around 1774); [[Schloss Wilhelmsh\u00f6he]], Kassel (33 models made 1777-1782); [[Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt]] (26 models acquired 1790/91); and the [[Herzogliches Museum Gotha]] (12 models, acquired after 1777/78.

She was noticed internationally when she stepped in for a performance of Donizetti's ''[[Lucrezia Borgia (opera)|Lucrezia Borgia]]'' at [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1965, and then appeared at leading opera houses. Her voice was described as pure but powerful, with superb control of vocal shadings and exquisite [[Dynamics (music)|pianissimo]].\n\nCaball\u00e9 became popular to non-classical music audiences in 1987, when she recorded, at the request of the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]], \"[[Barcelona (Freddie Mercury and Montserrat Caball\u00e9 song)|Barcelona]]\", a duet with [[Freddie Mercury]], which became an official theme song for the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympic Games]].

She was noticed internationally when she stepped in for a performance of Donizetti's ''[[Lucrezia Borgia (opera)|Lucrezia Borgia]]'' at [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1965, and then appeared at leading opera houses. Her voice was described as pure but powerful, with superb control of vocal shadings and exquisite [[Dynamics (music)|pianissimo]].\n\nCaball\u00e9 became popular to non-classical music audiences in 1987, when she recorded, at the request of the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]], \"[[Barcelona (Freddie Mercury and Montserrat Caball\u00e9 song)|Barcelona]]\", a duet with [[Freddie Mercury]], which became an official theme song for the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympic Games]].

She became part of the [[Theater Basel|Basel Opera]] company between 1957 and 1959, singing a repertoire that included Mozart (Erste Dame in ''[[The Magic Flute|Die Zauberfl\u00f6te]]'') and Strauss (''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'') in German, unusual for Spanish singers, but which proved useful for her next engagement at the [[Theater Bremen|Bremen Opera]] (1959\u20131962). In 1961, she starred as Iphig\u00e9nie in Gluck's ''[[Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride (Gluck)|Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride]]'' at the [[Teatro Nacional de S\u00e3o Carlos|National Theatre of S.

While this was her first engagement in a bel canto opera and she had to learn the role in less than one month, her performance made her famous throughout the opera world.
