{"title_page": "Structure of the Italian Army in 1989", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=October 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2019}}\nThe '''[[Order of Battle]] of the [[Italian Army]] at the end of 1989''' is given below.\n\nThe article is based on the 1984 publication of the Italian Army's order of battle by the Institute for Disarmament, Development and Peace (Istituto di ricerche per il disarmo, lo sviluppo e la pace (IRDISP) in [[Rome]] (a think thank of the [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radical Party]]). The published order of battle, down to company level, can be found at the Radical's Radio's website ([https://web.archive.org/web/20171201031533/http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/lesercito-italiano-3-quello-che-i-russi-gia-sanno-e-gli-italiani-non-devono-sapere Link]). The structure was then adapted with information from the Italian Army's website and its units' histories listed there. Additionally the following website was used, which lists every Order of Battle for Italy's armies from 1553 to 1997, [http://xoomer.virgilio.it/ramius//Militaria/L'ESERCITO_DAL_1553_AL_1996.html Link]. Specifically the Order of Battle after the 1986 reform was used, which was then corrected and expanded with the Italian Army's website information.\n\n== Graphic of the Italian Army in 1989 ==\n\n[[File:Italy Army - 1989.png|thumb|center|1200px|Structure of the Italian Army in 1989 (click image to enlarge)]]\n\n== Army General Staff ==\nThe Army General Staff in Rome oversaw all Italian Army units.

publication of the Italian Army's order of battle by the Institute for Disarmament, Development and Peace (Istituto di ricerche per il disarmo, lo sviluppo e la pace (IRDISP) in [[Rome]] (a think thank of the [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radical Party]]). The published order of battle, down to company level, can be found at the Radical's Radio's website ([https://web.archive.org/web/20171201031533/http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/lesercito-italiano-3-quello-che-i-russi-gia-sanno-e-gli-italiani-non-devono-sapere Link]). The structure was then adapted with information from the Italian Army's website and its units' histories listed there. Additionally the following website was used, which lists every Order of Battle for Italy's armies from 1553 to 1997, [http://xoomer.virgilio.it/ramius//Militaria/L'ESERCITO_DAL_1553_AL_1996.html Link].

She developed a [[silk screen]] technique that became her trademark. \n\n== Early Life & Education ==\nMalle Leis was born on July 7, 1940 in the town [[Viljandi|Viljandi, Estonia]]<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/967259045|title=Benezit dictionary of artists.|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=B\u00e9n\u00e9zit, E.

Leis began her education at the [[Tartu Art School]] attending from 1958 to 1961 and attended the [[Estonian Academy of Arts]] (also called Art Institute of Tallinn, see [[Estonian Academy of Arts|Wiki]] for associated names in past) from 1961 to 1967.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Rosenfeld|first=Alla|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46918250|title=Art of the Baltics : the struggle for freedom of artistic expression under the Soviets, 1945-1991|last2=Dodge|first2=Norton T|date=2002|publisher=Rutgers University Press|others=Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum|year=2002|isbn=0-8135-3042-3|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=67-69|oclc=46918250}}</ref> \n\nIn 1964, a group of young artists in Tallinn formed an organization called [[ANK '64]]<ref name=\":2\" />. Members of ANK' 64 included students of the [[Estonian Academy of Arts|art institute]], Malle Leis, [[T\u00f5nis Vint]], [[J\u00fcri Arrak]], Kristiina Kaasik, T\u00f5nis Laanemaa, Marju Mutsu, Enno Ootsing, Tiiu Pallo-Vaik, Vello Tamm, and Aili Vint. The small group aimed to hold exhibitions outside the official system, to change theoretical ideas, and to organize private seminars on modern art. Each of these goals were being neglected by the art institute, and ANK '64 worked to change that. The small group influenced many younger beginner artists. Many artists argued that ANK '64 played more of a role in artistic development than the institute would have.

was an Estonian painter and graphic artist.\n\nHer works mostly represent abstract forms in nature, including flowers, fruits and vegetables, but also landscapes. She developed a [[silk screen]] technique that became her trademark. \n\n== Early Life & Education ==\nMalle Leis was born on July 7, 1940 in the town [[Viljandi|Viljandi, Estonia]]<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/967259045|title=Benezit dictionary of artists.|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=B\u00e9n\u00e9zit, E.

Leis began her education at the [[Tartu Art School]] attending from 1958 to 1961 and attended the [[Estonian Academy of Arts]] (also called Art Institute of Tallinn, see [[Estonian Academy of Arts|Wiki]] for associated names in past) from 1961 to 1967.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Rosenfeld|first=Alla|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46918250|title=Art of the Baltics : the struggle for freedom of artistic expression under the Soviets, 1945-1991|last2=Dodge|first2=Norton T|date=2002|publisher=Rutgers University Press|others=Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum|year=2002|isbn=0-8135-3042-3|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=67-69|oclc=46918250}}</ref> \n\nIn 1964, a group of young artists in Tallinn formed an organization called [[ANK '64]]<ref name=\":2\" />. Members of ANK' 64 included students of the [[Estonian Academy of Arts|art institute]], Malle Leis, [[T\u00f5nis Vint]], [[J\u00fcri Arrak]], Kristiina Kaasik, T\u00f5nis Laanemaa, Marju Mutsu, Enno Ootsing, Tiiu Pallo-Vaik, Vello Tamm, and Aili Vint. The small group aimed to hold exhibitions outside the official system, to change theoretical ideas, and to organize private seminars on modern art. Each of these goals were being neglected by the art institute, and ANK '64 worked to change that. The small group influenced many younger beginner artists. Many argued that ANK '64 played more of a role in artistic development than the institute would have.<ref name=\":3\" /><br />\n\n== Artwork ==\n\n=== Mediums ===\nLeis typically worked with [[Oil painting|oil]], [[Watercolor painting|watercolor]], and [[Screen printing|serigraphs]], establishing herself not only as a painter, but also as a graphic artist.<br />\n\n== Awards ==\n\n=== Order of the White Star ===\nLeis was awarded the [[Order of the White Star]], IV Class in 2001.

In 2007, he joined the [[New Zealand Breakers]] of the Australian [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]] (NBL). In 2009, he was named the [[NBL Most Valuable Player Award|NBL MVP]], and in 2011, he won his first championship with the Breakers.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in the [[Auckland]] suburb of [[Milford, New Zealand|Milford]], Penney attended [[Westlake Boys High School]] and played junior basketball for the North Harbour Basketball Association, joining their [[National Basketball League (New Zealand)|New Zealand NBL]] team, the [[Harbour Heat|North Harbour Kings]], in [[1998 New Zealand NBL season|1998]] as a 17-year-old.

{"title_page": "List of power metal bands", "text_new": "{{Dynamic list}} \nThis is a '''list of power metal bands''' including notable bands that have at some point in their careers played power metal or heavily contributed to the genre's development. [[Power metal]] is a subgenre of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] music combining characteristics of [[traditional heavy metal|traditional metal]] with [[speed metal]], often within [[symphony|symphonic]] context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, in contrast to the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as [[doom metal]] and [[death metal]]. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \"powerful\" sound. Power metal has two distinct early styles, which developed in parallel. [[Power metal#American style|US Power Metal]] was developed in the mid/late 80s, pioneered by bands such as [[Omen (band)|Omen]] characterized by harsh thrashy sound and a focus on speed and soaring operatic vocals. It was directly influenced by [[speed metal]] and [[new wave of British heavy metal|NWOBHM]], and had a drop in popularity in the 90s. [[Power metal#European power metal|European Power Metal]] was developed in the late 80s by key bands such as [[Helloween]], and was more melodic, employing keyboards, synths and anthem-like songs.\n\n<!-- Please add bands that have articles to this list.

[[Power metal]] is a subgenre of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] music combining characteristics of [[traditional heavy metal|traditional metal]] with [[speed metal]], often within [[symphony|symphonic]] context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, in contrast to the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as [[doom metal]] and [[death metal]]. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \"powerful\" sound. Power metal has two distinct early styles, which developed in parallel. [[Power metal#American style|US Power Metal]] was developed in the mid/late 80s, pioneered by bands such as [[Omen (band)|Omen]] characterized by harsh thrashy sound and a focus on speed and soaring operatic vocals. It was directly influenced by [[speed metal]] and [[new wave of British heavy metal|NWOBHM]], and had a drop in popularity in the 90s. [[Power metal#European power metal|European Power Metal]] was developed in the late 80s by key bands such as [[Helloween]], and was more melodic, employing keyboards, synths and anthem-like songs.\n\n<!-- Please add bands that have articles to this list.
