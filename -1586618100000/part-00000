It was discovered in 1898 when [[Erik Lindblom]], [[Jafet Lindeberg]] and [[John Brynteson]], the \"Three Lucky Swedes\", found placer [[gold]] deposits on [[Anvil Creek, Alaska|Anvil Creek]] and on the [[Snake River (Nome, Alaska)|Snake River]] few miles from the future site of [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]]. Word of the strike caused a major [[gold rush]] to Nome in the spring of 1899.\n\n[[File:Nome Beach map.PNG|right|thumb|260px|Sketch map of the Nome Beach deposits and area creeks 1908]]\nThis was one of the first and was the biggest Alaskan gold rush in North America, only the [[California gold rush]]  and [[Klondike stampede]] in Canada were larger. A chaotic and lawless scene ensued, with rampant claim-jumping, crooked judges, and not enough gold found for the 20,000 prospectors, gamblers, shop and saloon-keepers, and prostitutes living in the tent city on the beachfront tundra, at least not at first.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sewardpeninsula.com/posts/nome|title=History of Nome|publisher=Carrie M. McLain Memorial Museum}}</ref> Then someone thought to pan the red-and-black streaked beach sands. Within days, gold was found for tens of miles up and down the beach from Nome.  More than a million dollars' worth of gold was taken from the beach in 1899. Subsequently the second and third beach lines were discovered and mined.  Anvil Creek produced the second-largest gold nugget found in Alaska (182 troy ounces), as well as the 6th, 7th, 9th, and 10th-largest.<ref>[http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF7/729.html The Nome Gold Rush, Alaska Science Forum<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.akmining.com/mine/nuggets.htm Alaska's Largest Gold Nuggets<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nExcept while prohibited by law during WWII, placer mining near Nome has continued to this day. Over 3.6 million troy ounces  of gold have been recovered from the creeks of the Nome District.\n\nA myriad of small hard-rock gold deposits were exploited near Nome, but production was very small, compared to the placer deposits, and none of the hard rock mines operated for more than a few years.<ref>''Nome quad ARDF, USGS''http://ardf.wr.usgs.gov/ardf_data/Nome.pdf</ref>\n\nIn 1908, the [[Alaska Road Commission]] began constructing a trail from [[Seward, Alaska|Seward]] to Nome, and in 1911, one year after the trail was completed, thousands of prospectors mushed or hiked to the [[Iditarod, Alaska|Iditarod]] gold fields, a population boom that helped lead to Alaska becoming a territory. That trail is known as the [[Iditarod Trail]], and is about 900 miles long.\n\n==Rock Creek mine==\nA new hardrock gold mine, Rock Creek, has been built. Start-up procedures began in September 2008. Production efforts were suspended in November, due to design inadequacies in the mill and complications meeting regulatory requirements. NovaGold's Rock Creek project has two planned components; the Rock Creek mine and mill complex seven miles north of Nome and the historic underground Big Hurrah mine site 42 miles east. Both sites are on the road net. The gold deposit at Rock Creek consists of sheeted gold and sulfide-bearing quartz veins in metamorphosed and deformed pelitic sediments. A placer gold deposit exploited in the early and late 1900s overlies the hardrock deposit. Early miners sunk workings to explore for hardrock gold, but did not find the large and high-grade gold-in-quartz veins necessary to be economic at that time. A prescient [[USGS]] geologist in 1908 identified the cluster of small veins as essentially a \"large low grade gold deposit\".  Underlying land is patented land owned by NovaGold and by the Sitnasauk Native village (surface) and Bering Sea regional (subsurface) Alaska Native Corporations.\n\nPlans include additional ore from the Big Hurrah mine, 42 miles west in the Solomon River watershed, to be trucked to the mill at Rock Creek. Big Hurrah originally opened in 1908, an underground mine exploiting large quartz veins cutting black slates.  The mine closed after only a few years; it was reopened for a few years in the 1950s and again in the 1970s.  Big Hurrah was the largest underground mine on the Seward Peninsula.\n\nBoth sites will be mined from [[open pit mining|open pits]]<ref>[http://www.novagold.com/section.asp?pageid=3357 NovaGold Resources Inc<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and ore recovery will use a combination of gravity methods and vat cyanide leach procedures. Rock Creek and Big Hurrah have combined probable reserves of 510,000 ounces of gold, with 32,000 additional indicated and inferred ounces of gold. Ore grade is about 1.75 g/t gold (0.05 ounces per ton gold).<ref>[http://www.novagold.com/section.asp?pageid=3432 NovaGold Resources Inc<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Gold mining in Alaska]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nome Mining District}}\n[[Category:Gold mining in Alaska]]\n[[Category:Geography of Nome Census Area, Alaska]]\n[[Category:Alaskan gold rushes]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n|name                     = Cape Nome mining district\n|official_name            = \n|settlement_type          = unincorporated mining district\n|nickname                 = \n|motto                    =\n\n<!-- Maps -->\n||pushpin_map            =Alaska\n|pushpin_label_position =left <!-- the position of the pushpin label: left, right, top, bottom, none -->\n|pushpin_map_caption    = \n|pushpin_mapsize        =\n|image_map                =  \n|mapsize                  = \n|map_caption              = \n|image_map1               = \n|mapsize1                 = \n|map_caption1             =\n\n<!-- General information -->\n|coordinates              = {{coord|64|34|N|165|20|W|display=inline}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Nome mining district''', also known as the '''[[Cape Nome]] mining district''', is a [[gold mining]] district in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Alaska]].
