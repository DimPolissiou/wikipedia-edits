In the next stage, [[Romain Maes]], who had finished in the same group as Fournier, won the time trial, and captured the lead. He lost it in the second part of that stage, when a group got away.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=144\u2013147}} Three regional riders were now on top of the general classification, led by [[Jean Fontenay]].\n\n[[Ren\u00e9 Vietto]], leader of the regional South-East team, was in second place. In the fourth stage, Vietto got into the winning break, and took over the lead, closesly followed by [[Mathias Clemens]] on six seconds.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=144\u2013147}}\n\nIn the ninth stage, the single Pyrenees stage of 1939, [[Edward Vissers]] attacked instead of helping his team leader [[Sylv\u00e8re Maes]]. Vissers won the stage, but Vietto was able to stay with Maes. Maes climbed to the second place in the general classification, three minutes behind Vietto.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=144\u2013147}}\n\nMaes was able to win back a little time, and just before the Alps were climbed from stage 15 on, Vietto was still leading, with Maes still in second place, two minutes behind. Sylv\u00e8re Maes attacked on that stage, and Vietto was not able to follow. Vietto finished 17 minutes behind Maes, and lost the lead. The next stage was split in three split stages. In the first part, Vietto was able to stay close to Maes, but in the second part, the individual mountain time trial, Maes won ten minutes on Vietto. Maes was now leading with a margin of 27 minutes, and the victory seemed secure.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=144\u2013147}}\n\nIn the last stages, Maes was able to extend his lead with a few more minutes. Maes became the winner, with a margin of more than half an hour.\n\n==Classification leadership and minor prizes==\n\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish each stage was recorded, and these times were added together for the [[general classification in the Tour de France|general classification]]. If a cyclist had received a time bonus, it was subtracted from this total; all time penalties were added to this total. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey. Of the 79 cyclists that started the race, 49 finished.\n\nFor the [[Mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]], 10 mountains were selected by the Tour organisation.<ref name=\"mdc1939\"/> The mountains classification in 1939 was won by [[Sylv\u00e8re Maes]]. The first cyclist to reach the top received 10 points, the second cyclist 9 points, and so on until the tenth cyclist who received 1 point.\n\nThe [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]] was calculated in 1939 by adding up the times of the best three cyclists of a team; the team with the least time was the winner. In 1939, there were ten teams of eight cyclists. There were the national teams of Belgium, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, and France. Belgium also sent a second team, \"Belgium B\". Finally, there were four regional French teams: North-East, West, South-West and South-East.<ref name=\"mdc1939\"/> The South-West team was registered with eight cyclist, but only seven cyclists started the race. Only two of the South-West cyclists finished the race, so they were not in the team classification.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:smaller; clear:both;\"\n|+Classification leadership by stage<ref name=\"tdf-statistics\">{{cite web|last=van den Akker|first=Pieter|title=Informatie over de Tour de France van 1939|trans-title=Information about the Tour de France from 1939|url=http://www.tourdefrancestatistieken.nl/tour.php?jaar=1939|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190302050021/http://www.tourdefrancestatistieken.nl/tour.php?jaar=1939|archivedate=2 March 2019|language=Dutch|website=TourDeFranceStatistieken.nl|accessdate=2 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:1%;\"| Stage\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:24%;\"| Winner\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:24%;\"| [[General classification in the Tour de France|General classification]]<br />[[File:Jersey yellow.svg|25px|link=]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:24%;\"| [[Mountains classification in the Tour de France|Mountains classification]]{{efn|name=mountains-jersey|No jersey was awarded to the leader of the mountains classification until a white jersey with red [[polka dot]]s was introduced in [[1975 Tour de France|1975]].{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=454}}}}\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:24%;\"| [[Team classification in the Tour de France|Team classification]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 10c#Stage 1|1]]\n| [[Romain Maes]]\n| style=\"background:#FFEB64;\"| [[Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Fournier]]\n| rowspan=\"11\"| ''no award''\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Belgium A\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 10c#Stage 2a|2a]]\n| [[\u00c9loi Tassin]]\n| style=\"background:#FFEB64;\"| [[Romain Maes]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 10c#Stage 2b|2b]]\n| [[Pierre Cloarec]]\n| style=\"background:#FFEB64;\" rowspan=\"2\"| [[Jean Fontenay]]\n| rowspan=\"6\"| France-West\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 10c#Stage 3|3]]\n| [[Raymond Louviot]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 10c#Stage 4|4]]\n| [[Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Fournier]]\n| style=\"background:#FFEB64;\" rowspan=\"16\"| [[Ren\u00e9 Vietto]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 10c#Stage 5|5]]\n| [[Lucien Storme]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 10c#Stage 6a|6a]]\n| [[Edmond Pag\u00e8s]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 10c#Stage 6b|6b]]\n| [[Raymond Passat]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 10c#Stage 7|7]]\n| [[Marcel Kint]]\n| rowspan=\"20\"| Belgium B\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 10c#Stage 8a|8a]]\n| [[Karl Litschi]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 10c#Stage 8b|8b]]\n| [[Edward Vissers]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 10c#Stage 9|9]]\n| [[Pierre Jaminet]]\n| rowspan=\"11\"| [[Edward Vissers]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 10c#Stage 10a|10a]]\n| [[Pierre Jaminet]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 10c#Stage 10b|10b]]\n| [[Maurice Archambaud]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 10c#Stage 10c|10c]]\n| [[Maurice Archambaud]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 11 to Stage 18b#Stage 11|11]]\n| [[Fabien Galateau]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 11 to Stage 18b#Stage 12a|12a]]\n| [[Fran\u00e7ois Neuens]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 11 to Stage 18b#Stage 12b|12b]]\n| [[Maurice Archambaud]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 11 to Stage 18b#Stage 13|13]]\n| [[Pierre Gallien]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 11 to Stage 18b#Stage 14|14]]\n| [[Pierre Cloarec]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 11 to Stage 18b#Stage 15|15]]\n| [[Sylv\u00e8re Maes]]\n| style=\"background:#FFEB64;\" rowspan=\"8\"| [[Sylv\u00e8re Maes]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 11 to Stage 18b#Stage 16a|16a]]\n| [[Pierre Jaminet]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 11 to Stage 18b#Stage 16b|16b]]\n| [[Sylv\u00e8re Maes]]\n| rowspan=\"6\"| [[Sylv\u00e8re Maes]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 11 to Stage 18b#Stage 16c|16c]]\n| [[Antoon van Schendel]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 11 to Stage 18b#Stage 17a|17a]]\n| [[Fran\u00e7ois Neuens]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 11 to Stage 18b#Stage 17b|17b]]\n| [[Maurice Archambaud]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 11 to Stage 18b#Stage 18a|18a]]\n| [[Ren\u00e9 Le Grev\u00e8s]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 11 to Stage 18b#Stage 18b|18b]]\n| [[Marcel Kint]]\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Final\n! style=\"background:#FFDB00;\"|[[Sylv\u00e8re Maes]]\n!

Maes was now leading with a margin of 27 minutes, and the victory seemed secure.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=144\u2013147}}\n\nIn the last stages, Maes was able to extend his lead with a few more minutes. Maes became the winner, with a margin of more than half an hour.\n\n==Classification leadership and minor prizes==\n\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish each stage was recorded, and these times were added together for the [[general classification in the Tour de France|general classification]]. If a cyclist had received a time bonus, it was subtracted from this total; all time penalties were added to this total. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey. Of the 79 cyclists that started the race, 49 finished.\n\nFor the [[Mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]], 10 mountains were selected by the Tour organisation.<ref name=\"mdc1939\"/> The mountains classification in 1939 was won by [[Sylv\u00e8re Maes]]. The first cyclist to reach the top received 10 points, the second cyclist 9 points, and so on until the tenth cyclist who received 1 point.\n\nThe [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]] was calculated in 1939 by adding up the times of the best three cyclists of a team; the team with the least time was the winner. In 1939, there were ten teams of eight cyclists. There were the national teams of Belgium, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, and France. Belgium also sent a second team, \"Belgium B\". Finally, there were four regional French teams: North-East, West, South-West and South-East.<ref name=\"mdc1939\"/> The South-West team was registered with eight cyclist, but only seven cyclists started the race. Only two of the South-West cyclists finished the race, so they were not in the team classification.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:smaller; clear:both;\"\n|+Classification leadership by stage<ref name=\"tdf-statistics\">{{cite web|last=van den Akker|first=Pieter|title=Informatie over de Tour de France van 1939|trans-title=Information about the Tour de France from 1939|url=http://www.tourdefrancestatistieken.nl/tour.php?jaar=1939|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190302050021/http://www.tourdefrancestatistieken.nl/tour.php?jaar=1939|archivedate=2 March 2019|language=Dutch|website=TourDeFranceStatistieken.nl|accessdate=2 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:1%;\"| Stage\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:24%;\"| Winner\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:24%;\"| [[General classification in the Tour de France|General classification]]<br />[[File:Jersey yellow.svg|25px|link=]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:24%;\"| [[Mountains classification in the Tour de France|Mountains classification]]{{efn|name=mountains-jersey|No jersey was awarded to the leader of the mountains classification until a white jersey with red [[polka dot]]s was introduced in [[1975 Tour de France|1975]].{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=454}}}}\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:24%;\"| [[Team classification in the Tour de France|Team classification]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 10c#Stage 1|1]]\n| [[Romain Maes]]\n| style=\"background:#FFEB64;\"| [[Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Fournier]]\n| rowspan=\"11\"| ''no award''\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Belgium A\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 10c#Stage 2a|2a]]\n| [[\u00c9loi Tassin]]\n| style=\"background:#FFEB64;\"| [[Romain Maes]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 10c#Stage 2b|2b]]\n| [[Pierre Cloarec]]\n| style=\"background:#FFEB64;\" rowspan=\"2\"| [[Jean Fontenay]]\n| rowspan=\"6\"| France-West\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 10c#Stage 3|3]]\n| [[Raymond Louviot]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 10c#Stage 4|4]]\n| [[Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Fournier]]\n| style=\"background:#FFEB64;\" rowspan=\"16\"| [[Ren\u00e9 Vietto]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 10c#Stage 5|5]]\n| [[Lucien Storme]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 10c#Stage 6a|6a]]\n| [[Edmond Pag\u00e8s]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 10c#Stage 6b|6b]]\n| [[Raymond Passat]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 10c#Stage 7|7]]\n| [[Marcel Kint]]\n| rowspan=\"20\"| Belgium B\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 10c#Stage 8a|8a]]\n| [[Karl Litschi]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 10c#Stage 8b|8b]]\n| [[Edward Vissers]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 10c#Stage 9|9]]\n| [[Pierre Jaminet]]\n| rowspan=\"11\"| [[Edward Vissers]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 10c#Stage 10a|10a]]\n| [[Pierre Jaminet]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 10c#Stage 10b|10b]]\n| [[Maurice Archambaud]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 10c#Stage 10c|10c]]\n| [[Maurice Archambaud]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 11 to Stage 18b#Stage 11|11]]\n| [[Fabien Galateau]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 11 to Stage 18b#Stage 12a|12a]]\n| [[Fran\u00e7ois Neuens]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 11 to Stage 18b#Stage 12b|12b]]\n| [[Maurice Archambaud]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 11 to Stage 18b#Stage 13|13]]\n| [[Pierre Gallien]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 11 to Stage 18b#Stage 14|14]]\n| [[Pierre Cloarec]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 11 to Stage 18b#Stage 15|15]]\n| [[Sylv\u00e8re Maes]]\n| style=\"background:#FFEB64;\" rowspan=\"8\"| [[Sylv\u00e8re Maes]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 11 to Stage 18b#Stage 16a|16a]]\n| [[Pierre Jaminet]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 11 to Stage 18b#Stage 16b|16b]]\n| [[Sylv\u00e8re Maes]]\n| rowspan=\"6\"| [[Sylv\u00e8re Maes]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 11 to Stage 18b#Stage 16c|16c]]\n| [[Antoon van Schendel]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 11 to Stage 18b#Stage 17a|17a]]\n| [[Fran\u00e7ois Neuens]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 11 to Stage 18b#Stage 17b|17b]]\n| [[Maurice Archambaud]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 11 to Stage 18b#Stage 18a|18a]]\n| [[Ren\u00e9 Le Grev\u00e8s]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[1939 Tour de France, Stage 11 to Stage 18b#Stage 18b|18b]]\n| [[Marcel Kint]]\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Final\n! style=\"background:#FFDB00;\"|[[Sylv\u00e8re Maes]]\n!

The Tour was split in 14 stages, with a total distance of {{convert|4497|km|mi}}.{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=108}}\n\nThe pre-race favourite was [[Lucien Petit-Breton]], winner of the [[1907 Tour de France|previous Tour]].
