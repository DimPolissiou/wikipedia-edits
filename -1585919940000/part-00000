Despite not being part of the original Arabic text, it is one of the best known tales in [[One Thousand and One Nights|''The Book of One Thousand and One Nights (The Arabian Nights)'']]. It was added to the collection in the 18th century by the Frenchman [[Antoine Galland]], who acquired the tale from [[Ottoman Syria|Syrian]] [[Maronites|Maronite]] storyteller [[Hanna Diyab]].<ref name=\"razzaque\">Razzaque (2017)</ref> In any case, since it first appeared, ''\"Aladdin and the Magic Lamp\"'' has been one of the best known and most retold of all fairy tales.\n\n==Sources==\nKnown along with [[Ali Baba]] as one of the \"orphan tales\", the story was not part of the original ''Nights'' collection and has no authentic Arabic textual source, but was incorporated into the book ''[[Les mille et une nuits]]'' by its [[French language|French]] translator, [[Antoine Galland]].<ref>Allen (2005) pp.280\u2013</ref>\n\n[[John Payne (poet)|John Payne]] quotes passages from Galland's unpublished diary: recording Galland's encounter with a [[Ottoman Syria|Syrian]] [[Maronite]] storyteller from [[Aleppo]], [[Hanna Diyab]].<ref name=\"razzaque\"/> According to Galland's diary, he met with Hanna, who had travelled from Aleppo to [[Paris]] with celebrated French traveller [[Paul Lucas (traveller)|Paul Lucas]], on March 25, 1709. Galland's diary further reports that his transcription of \"Aladdin kieki\" for publication occurred in the winter of 1709\u201310. It was included in his volumes ix and x of the ''Nights'', published in 1710, without any mention or published acknowledgment of Hanna's contribution. Paulo Lemos Horta, in the introduction to his translation of ''Aladdin'', speculates that Diyab might be the original author of at least some of the \"orphan\" tales, including Aladdin.<ref name=\"Horta\">Horta (2018) pp. 8-10</ref>\n\nTo return to Payne, he also records the discovery in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France|Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale]] in Paris of two [[Arabic language|Arabic manuscripts]] containing ''Aladdin'' (with two more of the \"interpolated\" tales). One was written by a Syrian Christian priest living in Paris, named [[Dionysios Shawish]], alias Dom Denis Chavis. The other is supposed to be a copy Mikhail Sabbagh made of a manuscript written in [[Baghdad]] in 1703. It was purchased by the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale at the end of the nineteenth century.<ref name=Payne1>Payne (1901) pp. 13-15</ref> As part of his work on the first critical edition of the ''Nights'', [[Iraq]]'s [[Muhsin Mahdi]] has shown<ref>Irwin (1994) pp. 57-58</ref> that both these manuscripts are \"back-translations\" of Galland's text into Arabic.<ref name=Mahdi1>Mahdi (1994) pp. 51-71 </ref><ref>Dobie (2008) p.36</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Robida - Aladin illustration page1.jpeg|200px|thumb|left|The Sorcerer traps Aladdin in the magic cave.]]\nThe story is often \"re-told\" with variations. The following is a pr\u00e9cis of the Burton translation of 1885.''<ref name=Burtony1>Burton (2009) pp. 1 ff</ref>\n\nAladdin is an impoverished young ne'er-do-well, dwelling in \"one of the cities of China\". He is recruited by a [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] from the [[Maghreb]], who passes himself off as the brother of Aladdin's late father, ''Mustapha the [[tailor]]'', convincing Aladdin and his mother of his good will by pretending to set up the lad as a wealthy merchant. The sorcerer's real motive is to persuade young Aladdin to retrieve a wonderful [[oil lamp]] from a [[Booby trap|booby-trapped]] magic cave. After the sorcerer attempts to double-cross him, Aladdin finds himself trapped in the cave. Aladdin is still wearing a [[magic ring]] the sorcerer has lent him. When he rubs his hands in despair, he inadvertently rubs the ring and a [[jinn]]\u012b (or \"genie\") appears who releases him from the cave, allowing him to return to his mother while in possession of the lamp. When his mother tries to clean the lamp, so they can sell it to buy food for their supper, a second far more powerful genie appears who is bound to do the bidding of the person holding the lamp.\n\nWith the aid of the genie of the lamp, Aladdin becomes rich and powerful and marries Princess [[Badroulbadour]], the [[sultan]]'s daughter (after magically foiling her marriage to the [[vizier]]'s son). The genie builds Aladdin and his bride a wonderful palace, far more magnificent than the sultan's.\n\nThe sorcerer hears of Aladdin's good fortune, and returns; he gets his hands on the lamp by tricking Aladdin's wife (who is unaware of the lamp's importance) by offering to exchange \"new lamps for old\". He orders the genie of the lamp to take the palace, along with all its contents, to his home in the Maghreb. Aladdin still has the magic ring and is able to summon the lesser genie. The genie of the ring cannot directly undo any of the magic of the genie of the lamp, but he is able to transport Aladdin to the Maghreb where, with the help of the \"woman's wiles\" of the princess, he recovers the lamp and slays the sorcerer, returning the palace to its proper place.\n\nThe sorcerer's more powerful and evil brother plots to destroy Aladdin for killing his brother by disguising himself as an old woman known for her healing powers. Badroulbadour falls for his disguise and commands the \"woman\" to stay in her palace in case of any illnesses. Aladdin is warned of this danger by the genie of the lamp and slays the impostor.\n\nAladdin eventually succeeds to his father-in-law's throne.\n\n==Setting==\nThe opening sentences of the story, in both the Galland and the Burton versions, set it in \"one of the cities of China\".<ref name=Plotz1>Plotz (2001) p. 148\u2013149</ref> On the other hand, there is practically nothing in the rest of the story that is inconsistent with a Middle Eastern setting. For instance, the ruler is referred to as \"[[Sultan]]\" rather than being called the \"[[Emperor of China|Emperor]]\", as in some re-tellings, and the people in the story are Muslims and their conversation is larded with [[Muslims|devout Muslim]] platitudes. A [[Jews|Jewish]] merchant buys Aladdin's wares (and incidentally cheats him), but there is no mention of [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] or [[Confucianism|Confucians]] (or other distinctively [[Chinese people]]).\n\nNotably, [[ethnic groups in Chinese history]] have long included [[Chinese Muslims|Muslim groups]], including large populations of [[Uighurs]], and the [[Hui people]] whose origins go back to [[Silk Road]] travelers. Islamic communities have been known to exist in the region since the [[History of Islam in China#Tang dynasty|Tang Dynasty]]. Some have suggested that the intended setting may be [[Turkestan]] (encompassing [[Central Asia]] and the modern Chinese province of [[Xinjiang]] in [[Western China]]).<ref name=Moon1>Moon (2005) p. 23</ref>\n\nFor all this, speculation about a \"real\" Chinese setting depends on a knowledge of China that the teller of a folk tale (as opposed to a geographic expert) might well not possess.<ref name=honor1>Honour (1973) - Section I \"The Imaginary Continent\"</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n{{See also|Aladdin (franchise)}}\n\nAdaptations vary in their faithfulness to the original story. In particular, difficulties with the Chinese setting are sometimes resolved by giving the story a more typical ''Arabian Nights'' background.\n\n===Books===\n* One of the many literary retellings of the tale appears in ''A Book of Wizards'' (1966) and ''[[A Choice of Magic]]'' (1971), by [[Ruth Manning-Sanders]].\n* \"The Nobility of Faith\" by [[Jonathan Clements]] in the anthology ''[[Doctor Who]] Short Trips: The Ghosts of Christmas ''(2007) is a retelling of the Aladdin story in the style of the Arabian Nights, but featuring the Doctor in the role of the genie.\n\n===Pantomimes===\n[[File:He's behind you.jpg|thumb|120px|right| An 1886 theatre poster advertising a production of the pantomime Aladdin.]]\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the story of Aladdin was dramatised in 1788 by [[John O'Keeffe (writer)|John O'Keefe]] for the [[The Royal Opera|Theatre Royal, Covent Garden]].<ref name=\"Witchard1\">Witchard (2017)</ref> It has been a popular subject for [[pantomime]] for over 200 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.its-behind-you.com/aladdin.html |title=Aladdin |website=www.its-behind-you.com |accessdate=2008-01-22 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080205031442/http://www.its-behind-you.com/aladdin.html| archivedate= 5 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional Aladdin pantomime is the source of the well-known pantomime character [[Widow Twankey]] (Aladdin's mother). In pantomime versions, changes in the setting and story are often made to fit it better into \"China\" (albeit a China situated in the [[East End of London]] rather than Medieval [[Baghdad]]), and elements of other Arabian Nights tales (in particular [[Ali Baba]]) are often introduced into the plot. One version of the \"pantomime Aladdin\" is [[Sandy Wilson]]'s [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Aladdin (1979 musical)|Aladdin]]'', from 1979.\n\nSince the early 1990s Aladdin pantomimes have tended to be influenced by [[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|the Disney animation]]. For instance, the 2007/8 production at the [[Birmingham Hippodrome]] starring [[John Barrowman]] featured songs from the Disney movies ''Aladdin'' and ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]''.\n\n=== Other musical theatre ===\n[[File:Victoria Disraeli cartoon.jpg|thumb|right|180px|''New Crowns for Old'', a 19th-century British cartoon based on the Aladdin story ([[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraeli]] as Abanazer from the [[pantomime]] version of Aladdin offering [[Queen Victoria]] an Imperial crown (of India) in exchange for a Royal one)]]\n* ''[[The New Aladdin]]'' was a successful [[Edwardian musical comedy]] in 1906.\n*[[Adam Oehlenschl\u00e4ger]] wrote his verse drama ''Aladdin'' in 1805.

In this version the princess Aladdin pursues is Achmed's sister and the sorcerer is his rival for her hand. The sorcerer steals the castle and the princess through his own magic and then sets a monster to attack Aladdin, from which Achmed rescues him. Achmed then informs Aladdin he requires the lamp to rescue his own intended wife, Princess Pari Banou, from the demons of the Island of Wak Wak. They convince the Witch of the Fiery Mountain to defeat the sorcerer, and then all three heroes join forces to battle the demons.\n* The 1938 animated film ''[[Have You Got Any Castles?]]'', Aladdin makes a brief appearance asking for help but gets punched by one of the Three Musketeers.\n* ''[[Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp]]'' is a 1939 ''[[Popeye|Popeye the Sailor]]'' cartoon.\n* The 1959 animated film ''[[1001 Arabian Nights (1959 film)|1001 Arabian Nights]]'' starring [[Mr. Magoo]] as Aladdin's uncle and produced by [[UPA (animation studio)|UPA]]''.\n* The animated feature ''[[Aladdin and His Magic Lamp (1970 film)|Aladdin et la lampe merveilleuse]]'' by Film Jean Image was released in 1970 in France. The story contains many of the original elements of the story as compared to the Disney version.\n* ''[[Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp (1982 film)|Aladdin and the Magic Lamp]]'' was a rendition in Japanese directed by Yoshikatsu Kasai, produced in Japan by [[Toei Animation]] and released in United States by [[The Samuel Goldwyn Company]] in 1982.\n* ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', the 1992 [[animated feature]] by [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]] (possibly currently the best known re-telling of the story). In this version several characters are renamed or amalgamated. For instance the Sorcerer and the Sultan's vizier become one character named [[List of Disney's Aladdin characters#Jafar|Jafar]] while the Princess is re-named [[Princess Jasmine|Jasmine]]. They have new motivations for their actions. The [[Genie (Disney)|Genie of the Lamp]] only grants three wishes and desires freedom from his role. A sentient [[magic carpet]] replaces the ring's genie while Jafar uses a royal magic ring to find Aladdin. The names \"Jafar\" and \"Abu\", the Sultan's delight in toys, and their physical appearances are borrowed from the 1940 film, ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1940 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]''. The setting is moved from China to the fictional Arabian city of Agrabah and the structure of the plot is simplified.\n**''[[The Return of Jafar]]'' (1994), [[direct-to-video]] sequel to the 1992 Walt Disney movie.\n**''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]'' (1996), direct-to-video second and final sequel to the 1992 Walt Disney movie.\n* ''[[Aladdin (1992 Golden Films film)|Aladdin]]'' by [[Golden Films]] was released directly on video in 1992.\n\n====Live action====\n* ''[[Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp (1917 film)|Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp]]'' (1917), directed by [[Chester M.

Despite not being part of the original Arabic text, it is one of the best known tales in [[One Thousand and One Nights|''The Book of One Thousand and One Nights (The Arabian Nights)'']]. It was added to the collection in the 18th century by the Frenchman [[Antoine Galland]], who acquired the tale from [[Ottoman Syria|Syrian]] [[Maronites|Maronite]] storyteller [[Hanna Diyab]].<ref name=\"razzaque\">Razzaque (2017)</ref> In any case, since it first appeared, ''\"Aladdin and the Magic Lamp\"'' has been one of the best known and most retold of all fairy tales.\n\n==Sources==\nKnown along with [[Ali Baba]] as one of the \"orphan tales\", the story was not part of the original ''Nights'' collection and has no authentic Arabic textual source, but was incorporated into the book ''[[Les mille et une nuits]]'' by its [[French language|French]] translator, [[Antoine Galland]].<ref>Allen (2005) pp.280\u2013</ref>\n\n[[John Payne (poet)|John Payne]] quotes passages from Galland's unpublished diary: recording Galland's encounter with a [[Ottoman Syria|Syrian]] [[Maronite]] storyteller from [[Aleppo]], [[Hanna Diyab]].<ref name=\"razzaque\"/> According to Galland's diary, he met with Hanna, who had travelled from Aleppo to [[Paris]] with celebrated French traveller [[Paul Lucas (traveller)|Paul Lucas]], on March 25, 1709. Galland's diary further reports that his transcription of \"Aladdin\" for publication occurred in the winter of 1709\u201310. It was included in his volumes ix and x of the ''Nights'', published in 1710, without any mention or published acknowledgment of Hanna's contribution. Paulo Lemos Horta, in the introduction to his translation of ''Aladdin'', speculates that Diyab might be the original author of at least some of the \"orphan\" tales, including Aladdin.<ref name=\"Horta\">Horta (2018) pp. 8-10</ref>\n\nTo return to Payne, he also records the discovery in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France|Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale]] in Paris of two [[Arabic language|Arabic manuscripts]] containing ''Aladdin'' (with two more of the \"interpolated\" tales). One was written by a Syrian Christian priest living in Paris, named [[Dionysios Shawish]], alias Dom Denis Chavis. The other is supposed to be a copy Mikhail Sabbagh made of a manuscript written in [[Baghdad]] in 1703. It was purchased by the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale at the end of the nineteenth century.<ref name=Payne1>Payne (1901) pp. 13-15</ref> As part of his work on the first critical edition of the ''Nights'', [[Iraq]]'s [[Muhsin Mahdi]] has shown<ref>Irwin (1994) pp. 57-58</ref> that both these manuscripts are \"back-translations\" of Galland's text into Arabic.<ref name=Mahdi1>Mahdi (1994) pp. 51-71 </ref><ref>Dobie (2008) p.36</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Robida - Aladin illustration page1.jpeg|200px|thumb|left|The Sorcerer traps Aladdin in the magic cave.]]\nThe story is often \"re-told\" with variations. The following is a pr\u00e9cis of the Burton translation of 1885.''<ref name=Burtony1>Burton (2009) pp. 1 ff</ref>\n\nAladdin is an impoverished young ne'er-do-well, dwelling in \"one of the cities of China\". He is recruited by a [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] from the [[Maghreb]], who passes himself off as the brother of Aladdin's late father, ''Mustapha the [[tailor]]'', convincing Aladdin and his mother of his good will by pretending to set up the lad as a wealthy merchant. The sorcerer's real motive is to persuade young Aladdin to retrieve a wonderful [[oil lamp]] from a [[Booby trap|booby-trapped]] magic cave. After the sorcerer attempts to double-cross him, Aladdin finds himself trapped in the cave. Aladdin is still wearing a [[magic ring]] the sorcerer has lent him. When he rubs his hands in despair, he inadvertently rubs the ring and a [[jinn]]\u012b (or \"genie\") appears who releases him from the cave, allowing him to return to his mother while in possession of the lamp. When his mother tries to clean the lamp, so they can sell it to buy food for their supper, a second far more powerful genie appears who is bound to do the bidding of the person holding the lamp.\n\nWith the aid of the genie of the lamp, Aladdin becomes rich and powerful and marries Princess [[Badroulbadour]], the [[sultan]]'s daughter (after magically foiling her marriage to the [[vizier]]'s son). The genie builds Aladdin and his bride a wonderful palace, far more magnificent than the sultan's.\n\nThe sorcerer hears of Aladdin's good fortune, and returns; he gets his hands on the lamp by tricking Aladdin's wife (who is unaware of the lamp's importance) by offering to exchange \"new lamps for old\". He orders the genie of the lamp to take the palace, along with all its contents, to his home in the Maghreb. Aladdin still has the magic ring and is able to summon the lesser genie. The genie of the ring cannot directly undo any of the magic of the genie of the lamp, but he is able to transport Aladdin to the Maghreb where, with the help of the \"woman's wiles\" of the princess, he recovers the lamp and slays the sorcerer, returning the palace to its proper place.\n\nThe sorcerer's more powerful and evil brother plots to destroy Aladdin for killing his brother by disguising himself as an old woman known for her healing powers. Badroulbadour falls for his disguise and commands the \"woman\" to stay in her palace in case of any illnesses. Aladdin is warned of this danger by the genie of the lamp and slays the impostor.\n\nAladdin eventually succeeds to his father-in-law's throne.\n\n==Setting==\nThe opening sentences of the story, in both the Galland and the Burton versions, set it in \"one of the cities of China\".<ref name=Plotz1>Plotz (2001) p. 148\u2013149</ref> On the other hand, there is practically nothing in the rest of the story that is inconsistent with a Middle Eastern setting. For instance, the ruler is referred to as \"[[Sultan]]\" rather than being called the \"[[Emperor of China|Emperor]]\", as in some re-tellings, and the people in the story are Muslims and their conversation is larded with [[Muslims|devout Muslim]] platitudes. A [[Jews|Jewish]] merchant buys Aladdin's wares (and incidentally cheats him), but there is no mention of [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] or [[Confucianism|Confucians]] (or other distinctively [[Chinese people]]).\n\nNotably, [[ethnic groups in Chinese history]] have long included [[Chinese Muslims|Muslim groups]], including large populations of [[Uighurs]], and the [[Hui people]] whose origins go back to [[Silk Road]] travelers. Islamic communities have been known to exist in the region since the [[History of Islam in China#Tang dynasty|Tang Dynasty]]. Some have suggested that the intended setting may be [[Turkestan]] (encompassing [[Central Asia]] and the modern Chinese province of [[Xinjiang]] in [[Western China]]).<ref name=Moon1>Moon (2005) p. 23</ref>\n\nFor all this, speculation about a \"real\" Chinese setting depends on a knowledge of China that the teller of a folk tale (as opposed to a geographic expert) might well not possess.<ref name=honor1>Honour (1973) - Section I \"The Imaginary Continent\"</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n{{See also|Aladdin (franchise)}}\n\nAdaptations vary in their faithfulness to the original story. In particular, difficulties with the Chinese setting are sometimes resolved by giving the story a more typical ''Arabian Nights'' background.\n\n===Books===\n* One of the many literary retellings of the tale appears in ''A Book of Wizards'' (1966) and ''[[A Choice of Magic]]'' (1971), by [[Ruth Manning-Sanders]].\n* \"The Nobility of Faith\" by [[Jonathan Clements]] in the anthology ''[[Doctor Who]] Short Trips: The Ghosts of Christmas ''(2007) is a retelling of the Aladdin story in the style of the Arabian Nights, but featuring the Doctor in the role of the genie.\n\n===Pantomimes===\n[[File:He's behind you.jpg|thumb|120px|right| An 1886 theatre poster advertising a production of the pantomime Aladdin.]]\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the story of Aladdin was dramatised in 1788 by [[John O'Keeffe (writer)|John O'Keefe]] for the [[The Royal Opera|Theatre Royal, Covent Garden]].<ref name=\"Witchard1\">Witchard (2017)</ref> It has been a popular subject for [[pantomime]] for over 200 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.its-behind-you.com/aladdin.html |title=Aladdin |website=www.its-behind-you.com |accessdate=2008-01-22 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080205031442/http://www.its-behind-you.com/aladdin.html| archivedate= 5 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional Aladdin pantomime is the source of the well-known pantomime character [[Widow Twankey]] (Aladdin's mother). In pantomime versions, changes in the setting and story are often made to fit it better into \"China\" (albeit a China situated in the [[East End of London]] rather than Medieval [[Baghdad]]), and elements of other Arabian Nights tales (in particular [[Ali Baba]]) are often introduced into the plot. One version of the \"pantomime Aladdin\" is [[Sandy Wilson]]'s [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Aladdin (1979 musical)|Aladdin]]'', from 1979.\n\nSince the early 1990s Aladdin pantomimes have tended to be influenced by [[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|the Disney animation]]. For instance, the 2007/8 production at the [[Birmingham Hippodrome]] starring [[John Barrowman]] featured songs from the Disney movies ''Aladdin'' and ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]''.\n\n=== Other musical theatre ===\n[[File:Victoria Disraeli cartoon.jpg|thumb|right|180px|''New Crowns for Old'', a 19th-century British cartoon based on the Aladdin story ([[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraeli]] as Abanazer from the [[pantomime]] version of Aladdin offering [[Queen Victoria]] an Imperial crown (of India) in exchange for a Royal one)]]\n* ''[[The New Aladdin]]'' was a successful [[Edwardian musical comedy]] in 1906.\n*[[Adam Oehlenschl\u00e4ger]] wrote his verse drama ''Aladdin'' in 1805.

In this version the princess Aladdin pursues is Achmed's sister and the sorcerer is his rival for her hand. The sorcerer steals the castle and the princess through his own magic and then sets a monster to attack Aladdin, from which Achmed rescues him. Achmed then informs Aladdin he requires the lamp to rescue his own intended wife, Princess Pari Banou, from the demons of the Island of Wak Wak. They convince the Witch of the Fiery Mountain to defeat the sorcerer, and then all three heroes join forces to battle the demons.\n* The 1938 animated film ''[[Have You Got Any Castles?]]'', Aladdin makes a brief appearance asking for help but gets punched by one of the Three Musketeers.\n* ''[[Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp]]'' is a 1939 ''[[Popeye|Popeye the Sailor]]'' cartoon.\n* The 1959 animated film ''[[1001 Arabian Nights (1959 film)|1001 Arabian Nights]]'' starring [[Mr. Magoo]] as Aladdin's uncle and produced by [[UPA (animation studio)|UPA]]''.\n* The animated feature ''[[Aladdin and His Magic Lamp (1970 film)|Aladdin et la lampe merveilleuse]]'' by Film Jean Image was released in 1970 in France. The story contains many of the original elements of the story as compared to the Disney version.\n* ''[[Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp (1982 film)|Aladdin and the Magic Lamp]]'' was a rendition in Japanese directed by Yoshikatsu Kasai, produced in Japan by [[Toei Animation]] and released in United States by [[The Samuel Goldwyn Company]] in 1982.\n* ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', the 1992 [[animated feature]] by [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]] (possibly currently the best known re-telling of the story). In this version several characters are renamed or amalgamated. For instance the Sorcerer and the Sultan's vizier become one character named [[List of Disney's Aladdin characters#Jafar|Jafar]] while the Princess is re-named [[Princess Jasmine|Jasmine]]. They have new motivations for their actions. The [[Genie (Disney)|Genie of the Lamp]] only grants three wishes and desires freedom from his role. A sentient [[magic carpet]] replaces the ring's genie while Jafar uses a royal magic ring to find Aladdin. The names \"Jafar\" and \"Abu\", the Sultan's delight in toys, and their physical appearances are borrowed from the 1940 film, ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1940 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]''. The setting is moved from China to the fictional Arabian city of Agrabah and the structure of the plot is simplified.\n**''[[The Return of Jafar]]'' (1994), [[direct-to-video]] sequel to the 1992 Walt Disney movie.\n**''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]'' (1996), direct-to-video second and final sequel to the 1992 Walt Disney movie.\n* ''[[Aladdin (1992 Golden Films film)|Aladdin]]'' by [[Golden Films]] was released directly on video in 1992.\n\n====Live action====\n* ''[[Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp (1917 film)|Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp]]'' (1917), directed by [[Chester M.

They were directed by [[T. R. Raghunath]] and produced by [[T. S. Balaiah]].\n* In the 1960s [[Bollywood]] produced ''Aladdin and [[Sinbad the Sailor|Sinbad]]'', very loosely based on the original, in which the two named heroes get to meet and share in each other's adventures.

{"title_page": "Sol Campbell", "text_new": "{{Use British English|date=January 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2018}}\n\n'''Sulzeer Jeremiah Campbell'''  (born 18 September 1974) is an English professional [[Manager (association football)|football manager]] and former [[Football player|player]] who is currently the manager of {{English football updater|SouthenU}} club [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]]. He previously managed [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]] from November 2018 to August 2019. A [[centre back]], he had a 20-year career playing in the [[Premier League]] and an 11-year international career with the [[England national football team|England national team]].\n\nBorn in [[North East (London sub region)|east London]] to Jamaican parents, Campbell began his career with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in December 1992. He spent nine years at Spurs, scoring 10 goals in 255 appearances, and [[captain (association football)|captaining]] the team to victory in the [[1999 Football League Cup Final]] against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]. In 2001, he joined Tottenham's [[North London derby|North London rivals]] [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on a free transfer, and as a result has known as \u2018Judas\u2019 and has remained a deeply unpopular figure amongst Spurs supporters. In his five years and 195 appearances at Arsenal, he won two Premier League winners medals and two [[FA Cup]] winners medals, encompassing the 2001\u201302 league and FA Cup [[Double (association football)|double]], and being part of the team that became known as ''[[The Invincibles (football)|The Invincibles]]'' for their undefeated [[2003\u201304 Arsenal F.C. season|2003\u201304 Premier League campaign]]. He scored Arsenal's only goal in their 2\u20131 defeat to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in the [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final]]. In August 2006, he joined [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] on a free transfer. His three years with the club included captaining them to victory in the [[2008 FA Cup Final]]. At the end of the 2008\u201309 season, he made the surprise move of dropping down three levels of the [[English football league system|English football pyramid]] to join League Two side [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] on a free transfer. He left the club by mutual consent in September 2009, having played just one match for the club. The next year, he made a brief return to Arsenal before ending his career with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].\n\nHaving already won caps for the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21s]] and [[England national football B team|England B team]], Campbell gained his first of 73 full caps for England aged 21. In May 1998, Campbell became what was then England's second-youngest captain, after [[Bobby Moore]], aged 23 years 248 days. In 2006, he became the only player to have represented England in six consecutive major tournaments, playing in the [[UEFA Euro 1996|1996]], [[UEFA Euro 2000|2000]] and [[UEFA Euro 2004|2004]] [[UEFA European Championship]]s; and the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]], [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] [[FIFA World Cup]]s. He was named in the Teams of the Tournament for the 2002 World Cup and at Euro 2004. Other honours in the game include being in the [[PFA Team of the Year]] three times, in 1999, 2003 and 2004.\n\nIn February 2015, Campbell announced an (ultimately unsuccessful) ambition to become the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] nominee for [[Mayor of London]] in the [[2016 London mayoral election|2016 election]].<ref name=\"independent1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/sol-campbell-confirms-intentions-to-run-for-london-mayor-i-have-got-so-much-to-offer-10071666.html|title=Sol Campbell confirms his intentions to run for this high-powered political role|date=26 February 2015|website=The Independent|accessdate=10 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nCampbell was born in [[Plaistow, Newham|Plaistow]], London, to Jamaican parents Sewell and Wihelmina.<ref>{{harvnb|Astaire|2014|p=5}}</ref> He was the youngest of twelve children, nine of whom were boys.<ref name=\"page 2\">{{harvnb|Astaire|2014|p=2}}</ref> His father Sewell was a railway worker and his mother Wihelmina was a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] factory worker.<ref name=\"page 2\"/> Despite growing up in a rough neighbourhood to a family with very little money, Campbell veered away from a life of crime due to his strict parents.<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\"><!--?REPEAT1?-->{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/inside-the-mind-of-sol-campbell-411153.html |title=Inside the mind of Sol Campbell |newspaper=The Independent |date=9 August 2006 |accessdate=19 April 2010 |location=London |first=Jason |last=Burt}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|\"I became a recluse within my own house.

He previously managed [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]] from November 2018 to August 2019. A [[centre back]], he had a 20-year career playing in the [[Premier League]] and an 11-year international career with the [[England national football team|England national team]].\n\nBorn in [[North East (London sub region)|east London]] to Jamaican parents, Campbell began his career with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in December 1992. He spent nine years at Spurs, scoring 10 goals in 255 appearances, and [[captain (association football)|captaining]] the team to victory in the [[1999 Football League Cup Final]] against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]. In 2001, he joined Tottenham's [[North London derby|North London rivals]] [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on a free transfer, and as a result has remained a deeply unpopular figure amongst Spurs supporters. In his five years and 195 appearances at Arsenal, he won two Premier League winners medals and two [[FA Cup]] winners medals, encompassing the 2001\u201302 league and FA Cup [[Double (association football)|double]], and being part of the team that became known as ''[[The Invincibles (football)|The Invincibles]]'' for their undefeated [[2003\u201304 Arsenal F.C. season|2003\u201304 Premier League campaign]]. He scored Arsenal's only goal in their 2\u20131 defeat to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in the [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final]]. In August 2006, he joined [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] on a free transfer. His three years with the club included captaining them to victory in the [[2008 FA Cup Final]]. At the end of the 2008\u201309 season, he made the surprise move of dropping down three levels of the [[English football league system|English football pyramid]] to join League Two side [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] on a free transfer. He left the club by mutual consent in September 2009, having played just one match for the club. The next year, he made a brief return to Arsenal before ending his career with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].\n\nHaving already won caps for the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21s]] and [[England national football B team|England B team]], Campbell gained his first of 73 full caps for England aged 21. In May 1998, Campbell became what was then England's second-youngest captain, after [[Bobby Moore]], aged 23 years 248 days. In 2006, he became the only player to have represented England in six consecutive major tournaments, playing in the [[UEFA Euro 1996|1996]], [[UEFA Euro 2000|2000]] and [[UEFA Euro 2004|2004]] [[UEFA European Championship]]s; and the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]], [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] [[FIFA World Cup]]s. He was named in the Teams of the Tournament for the 2002 World Cup and at Euro 2004. Other honours in the game include being in the [[PFA Team of the Year]] three times, in 1999, 2003 and 2004.\n\nIn February 2015, Campbell announced an (ultimately unsuccessful) ambition to become the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] nominee for [[Mayor of London]] in the [[2016 London mayoral election|2016 election]].<ref name=\"independent1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/sol-campbell-confirms-intentions-to-run-for-london-mayor-i-have-got-so-much-to-offer-10071666.html|title=Sol Campbell confirms his intentions to run for this high-powered political role|date=26 February 2015|website=The Independent|accessdate=10 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nCampbell was born in [[Plaistow, Newham|Plaistow]], London, to Jamaican parents Sewell and Wihelmina.<ref>{{harvnb|Astaire|2014|p=5}}</ref> He was the youngest of twelve children, nine of whom were boys.<ref name=\"page 2\">{{harvnb|Astaire|2014|p=2}}</ref> His father Sewell was a railway worker and his mother Wihelmina was a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] factory worker.<ref name=\"page 2\"/> Despite growing up in a rough neighbourhood to a family with very little money, Campbell veered away from a life of crime due to his strict parents.<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\"><!--?REPEAT1?-->{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/inside-the-mind-of-sol-campbell-411153.html |title=Inside the mind of Sol Campbell |newspaper=The Independent |date=9 August 2006 |accessdate=19 April 2010 |location=London |first=Jason |last=Burt}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|\"I became a recluse within my own house.

Earlier Viking settlers had begun arriving in the 880s, but were divided between colonies in the east ([[Roumois]] and [[Pays de Caux]]) around the low Seine valley and in the west in the [[Cotentin Peninsula]], and were separated by traditional ''[[Pagus|pagii]]'', where the population remained about the same with almost no foreign settlers. Rollo's contingents from Scandinavia who raided and ultimately settled Normandy and parts of the European Atlantic coast included [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], [[Norwegians]], [[Norse\u2013Gaels]], [[Orkney|Orkney Vikings]], possibly [[Swedes]], and Anglo-Danes from the English [[Danelaw]] territory which earlier came under Norse control in the early [[11th century]].\n\nThe descendants of Vikings replaced the [[Norse religion]] and [[Old Norse]] language with [[Catholicism]] ([[Christianity]]) and the [[Langues d'o\u00efl|Langue d'oil]] of the local people, descending from the [[Latin language|Latin]] of the [[Roman Empire|Romans]]. The [[Norman language]] (Norman French ) was forged by the adoption of the indigenous ''[[Langues d'o\u00efl|langue d'o\u00efl]]'' branch of [[Romance languages|Romance]] by a Norse-speaking ruling class, and it developed into the [[Languages of France|French regional languages]] that survive today.<ref name=\"Norman\" />\n\nThe Normans thereafter adopted the growing [[feudalism|feudal]] doctrines of the rest of France, and worked them into a functional hierarchical system in both [[Normandy]] and in [[Norman England|Norman dominated England]].<ref name=\"searle\"/> The new Norman rulers were culturally and ethnically distinct from the old [[French nobility|French aristocracy]], most of whom traced their lineage to the [[Franks]] of the [[Carolingian dynasty]] from the days of [[Charlemagne]] in the [[9th century]]. Most Norman knights remained poor and land-hungry, and by the time of the expedition and invasion of England in 1066, Normandy had been exporting fighting horsemen for more than a generation. Many Normans of [[Italy]], France and England eventually served as avid [[Crusades|Crusaders]] soldiers under the [[Italo-Norman]] prince [[Bohemund I of Antioch]] and the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] king [[Richard the Lion-Heart]], one of the more famous and illustrious Kings of England.\n\n==Conquests and military offensives==\n===Italy===\n{{See also|Norman conquest of southern Italy|Emirate of Sicily|Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture|Robert Guiscard|Italo-Norman}}\n[[File:Adrano normannisches Kastell.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The early Norman castle at [[Adrano]]]]\n\nOpportunistic bands of Normans successfully established a foothold in [[southern Italy]]. Probably as the result of returning pilgrims' stories, the Normans entered southern Italy as warriors in 1017 at the latest. In 999, according to [[Amatus of Montecassino]], Norman pilgrims returning from [[Jerusalem]] called in at the port of [[Salerno]] when a [[Saracen]] attack occurred. The Normans fought so valiantly that Prince [[Guaimar III of Salerno|Guaimar III]] begged them to stay, but they refused and instead offered to tell others back home of the Prince's request. [[William of Apulia]] tells that, in 1016, Norman pilgrims to the shrine of the [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] at [[Sanctuary of Monte Sant'Angelo|Monte Gargano]] were met by [[Melus of Bari]], a [[Lombards|Lombard]] nobleman and rebel, who persuaded them to return with more warriors to help throw off the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] rule, which they did.\n\nThe two most prominent Norman families to arrive in the [[Mediterranean]] were descendants of [[Tancred of Hauteville]] and the [[Drengot family]].\nA group of Normans with at least five brothers from the Drengot family fought the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] in [[Apulia]] under the command of Melo di Bari. Between 1016 and 1024, in a fragmented political context, the County of [[Ariano Irpino|Ariano]] was founded by another group of Norman knights headed by [[Gilbert Buat\u00e8re]] and hired by Melo di Bari. Defeated at [[Canne]], Melo di Bari escaped to [[Bamberg]], [[Germany]], where he died in 1022. The County, which replaced the pre-existing chamberlainship, is considered to be the first political body established by the Normans in the South of Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cesn.it/mezzogiorno.htm|title=Il Mezzogiorno agli inizi dell'XI secolo|trans-title=The south of Italy at the beginning of 11th century|website=European Center for Norman Studies|language=Italian}}</ref>\nThen [[Rainulf Drengot]], from the same family, received the county of [[Aversa]] from Duke [[Sergius IV of Naples]] in 1030.\n\nThe [[Hauteville family]] achieved princely rank by proclaiming Prince [[Guaimar IV of Salerno]] \"Duke of [[Apulia]] and [[Calabria]]\". He promptly awarded their elected leader, [[William Iron Arm]], with the title of count in his capital of [[Melfi]]. The Drengot family thereafter attained the [[principality of Capua]], and Emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] legally ennobled the Hauteville leader, [[Drogo of Hauteville|Drogo]], as \"''dux et magister Italiae comesque Normannorum totius Apuliae et Calabriae''\" (\"''Duke and Master of Italy and Count of the Normans of all Apulia and Calabria''\") in 1047.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Normans|last=Brown, R.

The Kingdom of Sicily thus became characterized by Norman, Byzantine, Greek, Arab, Lombard and \"native\" Sicilian populations living in harmony, and its [[List of monarchs of Sicily#Kings of Sicily|Norman rulers]] fostered plans of establishing an empire that would have encompassed [[Fatimid]] [[Egypt]] as well as the [[crusader states]] in the [[Levant]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url=http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9377080/Roger-II |title=Roger II \u2014King of Sicily |publisher=Concise.britannica.com |accessdate=2010-01-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523045823/http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9377080/Roger-II |archivedate=23 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D61331F935A15757C0A961948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2 |title=Tracing The Norman Rulers of Sicily |newspaper=New York Times |date=1987-04-26 |accessdate=2010-01-21 | first=Louis | last=Inturrisi}}</ref><ref>''Les Normands en Sicile'', p. 17.</ref> One of the great geographical treatises of the [[Middle Ages]], the \"''[[Tabula Rogeriana]]''\", was written by the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] [[al-Idrisi]] for King Roger II of Sicily, and entitled \"''Kitab Rudjdjar''\" (\"''The Book of Roger''\").<ref name=\"Lewis, p.148\">Lewis, p.148</ref>\n\n=== North Africa===\n{{See also|Kingdom of Africa}}\nBetween 1135 and 1160, the Norman kingdom of Sicily conquered and kept as vassals several cities on the [[Ifriqiya]] coast,  corresponding to Tunisia and parts of Algeria and Libya today.\nThey were lost to the Almohads.\n\n===Byzantium===\n{{See also|Byzantine-Norman wars|Varangian Guard|William Iron Arm}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2012}}\n{{context|section|date=December 2012}}\nSoon after the Normans began to enter Italy, they entered the [[Byzantine Empire]] and then [[Medieval Armenia|Armenia]], fighting against the [[Pechenegs]], the [[Bulgars]], and especially the [[Seljuk Turks]]. Norman mercenaries were first encouraged to come to the south by the Lombards to act against the Byzantines, but they soon fought in Byzantine service in Sicily. They were prominent alongside [[Varangian]] and Lombard contingents in the Sicilian campaign of [[George Maniaces]] in 1038\u201340. There is debate whether the Normans in Greek service actually were from Norman Italy, and it now seems likely only a few came from there. It is also unknown how many of the \"Franks\", as the Byzantines called them, were Normans and not other Frenchmen.\n\n[[File:Normannen.png|upright=1.15|thumb|Norman expansion by 1130]]\n\nOne of the first Norman mercenaries to serve as a Byzantine general was [[Herv\u00e9 (Norman)|Herv\u00e9]] in the 1050s. By then, however, there were already Norman mercenaries serving as far away as [[Trabzon|Trebizond]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. They were based at [[Malatya]] and [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], under the Byzantine duke of [[Antioch]], [[Isaac Komnenos, Duke of Antioch|Isaac Komnenos]]. In the 1060s, [[Robert Crispin]] led the Normans of Edessa against the Turks. [[Roussel de Bailleul]] even tried to carve out an independent state in [[Asia Minor]] with support from the local population, but he was stopped by the Byzantine general [[Alexius I Komnenos|Alexius Komnenos]].\n\nSome Normans joined Turkish forces to aid in the destruction of the Armenian vassal-states of [[Sassoun]] and [[Taron (historic Armenia)|Taron]] in far eastern [[Anatolia]]. Later, many took up service with the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenian state further south in Cilicia]] and the [[Taurus Mountains]]. A Norman named [[Roussel de Bailleul|Oursel]] led a force of \"Franks\" into the upper [[Euphrates]] valley in northern [[Syria]]. From 1073 to 1074, 8,000 of the 20,000 troops of the Armenian general [[Philaretus Brachamius]] were Normans\u2014formerly of Oursel\u2014led by [[Raimbaud]]. They even lent their ethnicity to the name of their castle: Afranji, meaning \"Franks\". The known trade between [[Republic of Amalfi|Amalfi]] and Antioch and between [[Bari]] and [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] may be related to the presence of Italo-Normans in those cities while Amalfi and Bari were under Norman rule in Italy.\n\nSeveral families of Byzantine Greece were of Norman mercenary origin during the period of the [[Comnenian Restoration]], when Byzantine emperors were seeking out western European warriors. The Raoulii were descended from an Italo-Norman named Raoul, the Petraliphae were descended from a Pierre d'Aulps, and that group of [[Albania]]n clans known as the Maniakates were descended from Normans who served under [[George Maniaces]] in the Sicilian expedition of 1038.\n\n[[Robert Guiscard]], another Norman adventurer previously elevated to the dignity of count of [[Apulia]] as the result of his military successes, ultimately drove the Byzantines out of southern [[Italy]]. Having obtained the consent of [[Pope Gregory VII]] and acting as his vassal, Robert continued his campaign conquering the Balkan peninsula as a foothold for western feudal lords and the Catholic Church. After allying himself with [[Kingdom of Croatia (925\u20131102)|Croatia]] and the Catholic cities of Dalmatia, in 1081 he led an army of 30,000 men in 300 ships landing on the southern shores of [[Albania]], capturing [[Vlora|Valona]], [[Kanin\u00eb|Kanina]], Jericho ([[Orikumi]]), and reaching [[Butrint]] after numerous pillages. They joined the fleet that had previously conquered [[Corfu]] and attacked [[Dyrrachium]] from land and sea, devastating everything along the way. Under these harsh circumstances, the locals accepted the call of Emperor [[Alexius I Comnenus]] to join forces with the Byzantines against the Normans. The [[Albania]]n forces could not take part in the ensuing [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (1081)|battle]] because it had started before their arrival. Immediately before the battle, the Venetian fleet had secured a victory in the coast surrounding the city. Forced to retreat, Alexius ceded the city of Dyrrachium to the [[Count of the Tent]] (or Byzantine provincial administrators) mobilizing from [[Arbanon]] (i.e., \u1f10\u03be \u1f08\u03c1\u03b2\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u1f41\u03c1\u03bc\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9 \u039a\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7; the term ''\u039a\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7'' is short for \u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 meaning \"Count of the Tent\").<ref>[[Anna Comnena]]. ''The Alexiad'', 4.8; {{harvnb|Vranousi|1962|pp=5\u201326}}.</ref> The city's garrison resisted until February 1082, when Dyrrachium was betrayed to the Normans by the Venetian and [[Amalfi]]tan merchants who had settled there. The Normans were now free to penetrate into the hinterland; they took Ioannina and some minor cities in southwestern Macedonia and Thessaly before appearing at the gates of Thessalonica. Dissension among the high ranks coerced the Normans to retreat to Italy. They lost Dyrrachium, Valona, and [[Butrint]] in 1085, after the death of Robert.\n\nA few years after the [[First Crusade]], in 1107, the Normans under the command of Bohemond, Robert's son, landed in Valona and besieged Dyrrachium using the most sophisticated military equipment of the time, but to no avail. Meanwhile, they occupied [[Petrela]], the citadel of Mili at the banks of the river [[Devoll (river)|Deabolis]], Gllavenica (Ballsh), Kanina and Jericho. This time, the Albanians sided with the Normans, dissatisfied by the heavy taxes the Byzantines had imposed upon them. With their help, the Normans secured the [[Arbanon]] passes and opened their way to Dibra. The lack of supplies, disease and Byzantine resistance forced Bohemond to retreat from his campaign and sign a peace treaty with the Byzantines in the city of Deabolis.\n\nThe further decline of Byzantine state-of-affairs paved the road to a third attack in 1185, when a large Norman army invaded [[Dyrrachium]], owing to the betrayal of high Byzantine officials. Some time later, Dyrrachium\u2014one of the most important naval bases of the [[Adriatic]]\u2014fell again to Byzantine hands.\n\n===England===\n<!--Tostig Godwinson links here-->\n{{See also|Norman conquest of England|William the Conqueror|Domesday Book|Anglo-Normans}}\n{{House of Normandy}}\nThe Normans were in contact with England from an early date. Not only were their original Viking brethren still ravaging the English coasts, they occupied most of the important ports opposite England across the [[English Channel]]. This relationship eventually produced closer ties of blood through the marriage of [[Emma of Normandy|Emma]], sister of Duke [[Richard II of Normandy]], and King [[Ethelred II of England]]. Because of this, Ethelred fled to Normandy in 1013, when he was forced from his kingdom by [[Sweyn Forkbeard]]. His stay in Normandy (until 1016) influenced him and his sons by Emma, who stayed in Normandy after [[Cnut the Great]]'s conquest of the isle.\n\nWhen [[Edward the Confessor]] finally returned from his father's refuge in 1041, at the invitation of his half-brother [[Harthacnut]], he brought with him a Norman-educated mind. He also brought many Norman counsellors and fighters, some of whom established an English cavalry force. This concept never really took root, but it is a typical example of Edward's attitude. He appointed [[Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges]] [[archbishop of Canterbury]] and made [[Ralph the Timid]] [[earl of Hereford]]. He invited his brother-in-law [[Eustace II, Count of Boulogne]] to his court in 1051, an event that resulted in the greatest of early conflicts between Saxon and Norman and ultimately resulted in the exile of Earl [[Godwin of Wessex]].\n\n[[File:Bayeux Tapestry scene19 detail Castle Dinan.jpg|upright=1.15|left|thumb|Siege of a [[motte-and-bailey]] castle from the [[Bayeux Tapestry]]]]\n\nOn 14 October 1066, [[William the Conqueror]] gained a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Hastings]], which led to the conquest of England three years later;<ref>''The Normans'', [[Marjorie Chibnall]]</ref> this can be seen on the [[Bayeux tapestry]] (a linen, embroidered cloth). The invading Normans and their descendants replaced the [[Anglo-Saxons]] as the ruling class of England. The nobility of England were part of a single Norman culture and many had lands on both sides of the channel. Early Norman kings of England, as Dukes of Normandy, owed homage to the King of France for their land on the continent. They considered England to be their most important holding (it brought with it the title of King\u2014an important status symbol).\n\nEventually, the Normans merged with the natives, combining languages and traditions, so much so that [[Marjorie Chibnall]] says \"writers still referred to Normans and English; but the terms no longer meant the same as in the immediate aftermath of 1066.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Normans|last=Chibnall|first=Marjorie|authorlink = Marjorie Chibnall|publisher=Blackwell publishing|year=2000|isbn=978-1-4051-4965-5|location=Oxford|pages=62|quote=|via=}}</ref> In the course of the [[Hundred Years' War]], the Norman aristocracy often identified themselves as English. The [[Anglo-Norman language]] became distinct from the [[Latin language]], something that was the subject of some humour by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]. The Anglo-Norman language was eventually absorbed into the Anglo-Saxon language of their subjects (see [[Old English]]) and influenced it, helping (along with the [[Norse language]] of the earlier [[Danelaw|Anglo-Norse]] settlers and the [[Ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]] used by the church) in the development of [[Middle English]]. It in turn evolved into [[Modern English]].\n\n===Ireland===\n{{See also|Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman Ireland|Normans in Ireland}}\n[[File:Trim Castle 6.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Norman keep in [[Trim, County Meath|Trim]], [[County Meath]]]]\nThe Normans had a profound effect on Irish culture and history after their invasion at [[Bannow Bay]] in 1169. Initially, the Normans maintained a distinct culture and ethnicity. Yet, with time, they came to be subsumed into Irish culture to the point that it has been said that they became \"[[More Irish than the Irish themselves (slogan)|more Irish than the Irish themselves]]\". The Normans settled mostly in an area in the east of [[Ireland]], later known as [[the Pale]], and also built many fine castles and settlements, including [[Trim Castle]] and [[Dublin Castle]]. Both cultures intermixed, borrowing from each other's language, culture and outlook. Norman descendants today can be recognised by their [[surnames]]. Names such as French, (De) Roche, Devereux, D'Arcy, Treacy and Lacy are particularly common in the southeast of Ireland, especially in the southern part of County [[Wexford]], where the first Norman settlements were established. Other Norman names, such as Furlong, predominate there. Another common Norman-Irish name was Morell (Murrell), derived from the French Norman name Morel. Names beginning with Fitz (from the Norman for son) usually indicate Norman ancestry. Except for the native surname Fitzpatrick, a [[Gallicisation|gallicisation]] of Mac Giolla Ph\u00e1draig/\u00d3 Maol Ph\u00e1draig. Hiberno-Norman surnames with the prefix - 'fitz' include [[FitzGerald dynasty|Fitzgerald]], FitzGibbons (Gibbons) dynasty, [[Fitzmaurice]]. Families bearing such surnames as [[Barry (name)|Barry (de Barra)]] and [[House of Burke|De B\u00farca (Burke)]] are also of Norman extraction.\n\n===Scotland===\n{{See also|Scotland in the High Middle Ages|Scoto-Norman}}\nOne of the claimants of the English throne opposing [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]], [[Edgar Atheling]], eventually fled to Scotland. King [[Malcolm III of Scotland]] married Edgar's sister [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Margaret]], and came into opposition to William who had already disputed Scotland's southern borders. William invaded Scotland in 1072, riding as far as [[Abernethy, Perth and Kinross|Abernethy]] where he met up with his fleet of ships. Malcolm submitted, paid homage to William and surrendered his son [[Duncan II of Scotland|Duncan]] as a hostage, beginning a series of arguments as to whether the Scottish Crown owed allegiance to the King of England.\n\nNormans went into Scotland, building castles and founding noble families that would provide some future kings, such as [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]], as well as founding a considerable number of the [[Scottish clan]]s. King [[David I of Scotland]], whose elder brother [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]] had married [[Sybilla of Normandy]], was instrumental in introducing Normans and Norman culture to [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], part of the process some scholars call the \"[[Davidian Revolution]]\". Having spent time at the court of [[Henry I of England]] (married to David's sister [[Edith of Scotland|Maud of Scotland]]), and needing them to wrestle the kingdom from his half-brother [[M\u00e1el Coluim mac Alaxandair]], David had to reward many with lands. The process was continued under David's successors, most intensely of all under [[William I of Scotland|William the Lion]]. The Norman-derived [[feudal]] system was applied in varying degrees to most of Scotland. Scottish families of the names [[Bruce (surname)|Bruce]], [[Gray (surname)|Gray]], Ramsay, Fraser, Rose, Ogilvie, Montgomery, Sinclair, Pollock, Burnard, Douglas and [[Gordon (surname)|Gordon]] to name but a few, and including the later royal [[House of Stewart]], can all be traced back to Norman ancestry.\n\n===Wales===\n{{See also|Norman invasion of Wales|Cambro-Norman}}\n[[File:Mms chepstow castle from river wye.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|[[Chepstow Castle]] in Wales, built by [[William fitzOsbern]] in 1067]]\nEven before the Norman Conquest of England, the Normans had come into contact with [[Wales]]. Edward the Confessor had set up the aforementioned Ralph as earl of Hereford and charged him with defending the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]] and warring with the Welsh. In these original ventures, the Normans failed to make any headway into Wales.\n\nSubsequent to the Conquest, however, the Marches came completely under the dominance of William's most trusted Norman barons, including [[Bernard de Neufmarch\u00e9]], [[Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury|Roger of Montgomery]] in [[Shropshire]] and [[Hugh, 1st Earl of Chester|Hugh Lupus]] in [[Cheshire]]. These Normans began a long period of slow conquest during which almost all of Wales was at some point subject to Norman interference. Norman words, such as ''baron'' (''barwn''), first entered [[Welsh language|Welsh]] at that time.\n\n===On crusade===\n{{See also|Principality of Antioch|Bohemund I of Antioch|Richard the Lion-Heart}}\nThe legendary religious zeal of the Normans was exercised in religious wars long before the [[First Crusade]] carved out a Norman [[Principality of Antioch|principality in Antioch]]. They were major foreign participants in the [[Reconquista]] in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]]. In 1018, [[Roger I of Tosny|Roger de Tosny]] travelled to the Iberian Peninsula to carve out a state for himself from [[Moorish]] lands, but failed. In 1064, during the [[War of Barbastro]], [[William of Montreuil]] led the papal army and took a huge booty.\n\nIn 1096, Crusaders passing by the siege of [[Amalfi]] were joined by [[Bohemund I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]] and his nephew [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]] with an army of Italo-Normans. Bohemond was the ''de facto'' leader of the Crusade during its passage through [[Asia Minor]]. After the successful [[Siege of Antioch]] in 1097, Bohemond began carving out an independent principality around that city. Tancred was instrumental in the conquest of [[Jerusalem]] and he worked for the expansion of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Crusader kingdom]] in [[Oultrejordain|Transjordan]] and the region of [[Galilee]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n===Anglo-Norman conquest of Cyprus===\n{{See also|Kingdom of Cyprus|Cyprus in the Middle Ages}}[[File:Lusignan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Illuminated manuscript showing king [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lion-hearted]] authorizing [[Guy de Lusignan]] to take [[Kingdom of Cyprus|Cyprus]]]]\nThe conquest of [[Cyprus]] by the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] forces of the [[Third Crusade]] opened a new chapter in the history of the island, which would be under [[Western Europe]]an domination for the following 380 years. Although not part of a planned operation, the conquest had much more permanent results than initially expected.\n\nIn April 1191, [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lion-hearted]] left [[Messina]] with a large fleet in order to reach [[Acre (city)|Acre]].{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 131}} But a storm dispersed the fleet. After some searching, it was discovered that the boat carrying his sister and his fianc\u00e9e Berengaria was anchored on the south coast of Cyprus, together with the wrecks of several other ships, including the treasure ship.

Richard then proceeded to conquer the whole island, his troops being led by Guy de Lusignan. Isaac surrendered and was confined with silver chains, because Richard had promised that he would not place him in irons. By 1 June, Richard had conquered the whole island. His exploit was well publicized and contributed to his reputation; he also derived significant financial gains from the conquest of the island.{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 138}} Richard left for [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] on 5 June, with his allies.{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 138}} Before his departure, he named two of his Norman generals, [[Richard de Camville]] and [[Robert of Thornham|Robert de Thornham]], as governors of Cyprus.\n\nWhile in Limassol, Richard the Lion-Heart married [[Berengaria of Navarre]], first-born daughter of King [[Sancho VI of Navarre]]. The wedding was held on 12 May 1191 at the Chapel of St. George and it was attended by Richard's sister [[Joan of England, Queen of Sicily|Joan]], whom he had brought from [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]]. The marriage was celebrated with great pomp and splendor. Among other grand ceremonies was a double coronation: Richard caused himself to be crowned [[King of Cyprus]], and Berengaria Queen of England and [[List of Cypriot consorts|Queen of Cyprus]] as well.\n\n[[File:Le Canarien.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Norman expeditionary ship depicted in the chronicle ''[[Le Canarien]]'' (1490)]]\n\nThe rapid Anglo-Norman conquest proved more important than it seemed. The island occupied a key strategic position on the maritime lanes to the Holy Land, whose occupation by the Christians could not continue without support from the sea.{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 137}} Shortly after the conquest, Cyprus was sold to the [[Knights Templar]] and it was subsequently acquired, in 1192, by Guy de Lusignan and became a [[Kingdom of Cyprus|stable feudal kingdom]].{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 137}} It was only in 1489 that the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] acquired full control of the island, which remained a Christian stronghold until the [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1570\u20131573)|fall of Famagusta]] in 1571.{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 138}}\n\n===Canary Islands===\n{{see also|Conquest of the Canary Islands}}\nBetween 1402 and 1405, the expedition led by the Norman noble [[Jean de Bethencourt]]<ref name=\"EB1911Bethencourt\">{{EB1911|wstitle=B\u00e9thencourt, Jean de|volume=3}}</ref> and the [[Poitevine]] [[Gadifer de la Salle]] conquered the [[Canary Islands|Canarian islands]] of [[Lanzarote]], [[Fuerteventura]] and [[El Hierro]] off the Atlantic coast of Africa. Their troops were gathered in Normandy, Gascony and were later reinforced by [[Castilian people|Castilian]] colonists.\n\nBethencourt took the title of [[King of the Canary Islands]], as vassal to [[Henry III of Castile]]. In 1418, Jean's nephew [[Maciot de Bethencourt]] sold the rights to the islands to [[Enrique P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n, 2nd Count de Niebla]].\n\n==Culture==\n===Norman law===\n{{main|Norman law|Clameur de haro}}\nThe [[Custom (law)|customary law]] of [[Normandy]] was developed between the 10th and 13th centuries and survives today through the legal systems of [[Law of Jersey|Jersey]] and [[Guernsey]] in the [[Channel Islands]]. Norman customary law was transcribed in two [[Coutume|customaries]] in [[Latin]] by two judges for use by them and their colleagues:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mondes-normands.caen.fr/angleterre/cultures/GB_FR/culture1_7.htm|title=Norman customary law|website=Mondes-normands.caen.fr|accessdate=20 May 2018}}</ref> These are the ''Tr\u00e8s ancien coutumier'' (''Very ancient customary''), authored between 1200 and 1245; and the ''Grand coutumier de Normandie'' (''Great customary of Normandy'', originally ''Summa de legibus Normanniae in curia la\u00efcali''), authored between 1235 and 1245.\n\n===Architecture===\n{{Main|Norman architecture}}\n[[File:Tower of London, Traitors Gate.jpg|thumb|A quintessential Norman keep: the [[Tower of London|White Tower]] in [[London]]]]\n\nNorman architecture typically stands out as a new stage in the architectural history of the regions they subdued. They spread a unique [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque idiom]] to England, Italy and Ireland, and the [[encastellation]] of these regions with [[keep]]s in their north French style fundamentally altered the military landscape. Their style was characterised by rounded [[arch]]es, particularly over windows and doorways, and massive proportions.\n\nIn England, the period of Norman architecture immediately succeeds that of the [[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Anglo-Saxon]] and precedes the [[Gothic architecture|Early Gothic]]. In southern Italy, the Normans incorporated elements of [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]], [[Lombardic architecture|Lombard]], and [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] building techniques into their own, initiating a unique style known as [[Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture#Norman-Arab-Byzantine architecture|Norman-Arab architecture]] within the [[Kingdom of Sicily]].<ref name=\"Sicily\" />\n\n===Visual arts===\nIn the visual arts, the Normans did not have the rich and distinctive traditions of the cultures they conquered. However, in the early 11th century the dukes began a programme of church reform, encouraging the [[Cluniac reform]] of monasteries and patronising intellectual pursuits, especially the proliferation of [[scriptoria]] and the reconstitution of a compilation of lost [[illuminated manuscript]]s. The church was utilised by the dukes as a unifying force for their disparate duchy. The chief monasteries taking part in this \"renaissance\" of Norman art and scholarship were [[Mont-Saint-Michel]], [[F\u00e9camp]], [[Jumi\u00e8ges]], [[Bec-de-Mortagne|Bec]], [[Saint-Ouen, Rouen|Saint-Ouen]], [[Saint-Evroul]], and [[Saint-Wandrille]]. These centres were in contact with the so-called \"[[Winchester]] school\", which channeled a pure [[Carolingian art]]istic tradition to Normandy. In the final decade of the 11th and first of the 12th century, Normandy experienced a golden age of illustrated manuscripts, but it was brief and the major scriptoria of Normandy ceased to function after the midpoint of the century.\n\n[[File:Lion, Norman Italy 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A bronze lion sculpture attributed to an [[Italo-Norman]] artist. Now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]\n\nThe [[French Wars of Religion]] in the 16th century and the [[French Revolution]] in the 18th successively destroyed much of what existed in the way of the architectural and artistic remnant of this Norman creativity. The former, with their violence, caused the wanton destruction of many Norman edifices; the latter, with its assault on religion, caused the purposeful destruction of religious objects of any type, and its destabilisation of society resulted in rampant pillaging.\n\nBy far the most famous work of Norman art is the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], which is not a [[tapestry]] but a work of [[embroidery]]. It was commissioned by [[Odo of Bayeux|Odo]], the [[Bishop of Bayeux]] and first [[Earl of Kent]], employing natives from [[Kent]] who were learned in the Nordic traditions imported in the previous half century by the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danish]] [[Vikings]].\n\nIn Britain, Norman art primarily survives as [[stonework]] or [[metalwork]], such as [[capital (column)|capitals]] and [[baptismal font]]s. In southern Italy, however, Norman artwork survives plentifully in forms strongly influenced by its Greek, Lombard, and Arab forebears. Of the royal regalia preserved in Palermo, the crown is Byzantine in style and the coronation cloak is of Arab craftsmanship with [[Arabic language|Arabic]] inscriptions. Many churches preserve sculptured fonts, capitals, and more importantly mosaics, which were common in Norman Italy and drew heavily on the Greek heritage. Lombard Salerno was a centre of [[ivory]]work in the 11th century and this continued under Norman domination. The intercourse between French Crusaders traveling to the Holy Land who brought with them French artefacts with which to gift the churches at which they stopped in southern Italy amongst their Norman cousins. For this reason many south Italian churches preserve works from France alongside their native pieces.\n\n===Music===\n[[File:David on harp.jpg|thumb|An illuminated manuscript from [[Saint-Evroul]] depicting [[King David]] on the lyre (or harp) in the middle of the back of the initial 'B']]\nNormandy was the site of several important developments in the history of [[classical music]] in the 11th century. [[F\u00e9camp Abbey]] and [[Saint-Evroul Abbey]] were centres of musical production and education. At F\u00e9camp, under two Italian abbots, [[William of Volpiano]] and John of Ravenna, the system of denoting notes by letters was developed and taught. It is still the most common form of pitch representation in English- and German-speaking countries today. Also at F\u00e9camp, the [[Staff (music)|staff]], around which [[neume]]s were oriented, was first developed and taught in the 11th century. Under the German abbot [[Isembard of La Trinit\u00e9-du-Mont|Isembard]], [[La Trinit\u00e9-du-Mont]] became a centre of musical composition.\n\nAt Saint Evroul, a tradition of singing had developed and the choir achieved fame in Normandy. Under the Norman abbot [[Robert de Grantmesnil]], several monks of Saint-Evroul fled to southern Italy, where they were patronised by Robert Guiscard and established a Latin monastery at [[Lamezia Terme#Sant'Eufemia Lamezia|Sant'Eufemia Lamezia]].

Rollo's contingents from Scandinavia who raided and ultimately settled Normandy and parts of the European Atlantic coast included [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], [[Norwegians]], [[Norse\u2013Gaels]], [[Orkney|Orkney Vikings]], possibly [[Swedes]], and Anglo-Danes from the English [[Danelaw]] territory which earlier came under Norse control in the early [[11th century]].\n\nThe descendants of Vikings replaced the [[Norse religion]] and [[Old Norse]] language with [[Catholicism]] ([[Christianity]]) and the [[Langues d'o\u00efl|Langue d'oil]] of the local people, descending from the [[Latin language|Latin]] of the [[Roman Empire|Romans]].

In 999, according to [[Amatus of Montecassino]], Norman pilgrims returning from [[Jerusalem]] called in at the port of [[Salerno]] when a [[Saracen]] attack occurred. The Normans fought so valiantly that Prince [[Guaimar III of Salerno|Guaimar III]] begged them to stay, but they refused and instead offered to tell others back home of the Prince's request. [[William of Apulia]] tells that, in 1016, Norman pilgrims to the shrine of the [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] at [[Sanctuary of Monte Sant'Angelo|Monte Gargano]] were met by [[Melus of Bari]], a [[Lombards|Lombard]] nobleman and rebel, who persuaded them to return with more warriors to help throw off the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] rule, which they did.\n\nThe two most prominent Norman families to arrive in the [[Mediterranean]] were descendants of [[Tancred of Hauteville]] and the [[Drengot family]].\nA group of Normans with at least five brothers from the Drengot family fought the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] in [[Apulia]] under the command of Melo di Bari. Between 1016 and 1024, in a fragmented political context, the County of [[Ariano Irpino|Ariano]] was founded by another group of Norman knights headed by [[Gilbert Buat\u00e8re]] and hired by Melo di Bari. Defeated at [[Canne]], Melo di Bari escaped to [[Bamberg]], [[Germany]], where he died in 1022. The County, which replaced the pre-existing chamberlainship, is considered to be the first political body established by the Normans in the South of Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cesn.it/mezzogiorno.htm|title=Il Mezzogiorno agli inizi dell'XI secolo|trans-title=The south of Italy at the beginning of 11th century|website=European Center for Norman Studies|language=Italian}}</ref>\nThen [[Rainulf Drengot]], from the same family, received the county of [[Aversa]] from Duke [[Sergius IV of Naples]] in 1030.\n\nThe [[Hauteville family]] achieved princely rank by proclaiming Prince [[Guaimar IV of Salerno]] \"Duke of [[Apulia]] and [[Calabria]]\". He promptly awarded their elected leader, [[William Iron Arm]], with the title of count in his capital of [[Melfi]]. The Drengot family thereafter attained the [[principality of Capua]], and Emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] legally ennobled the Hauteville leader, [[Drogo of Hauteville|Drogo]], as \"''dux et magister Italiae comesque Normannorum totius Apuliae et Calabriae''\" (\"''Duke and Master of Italy and Count of the Normans of all Apulia and Calabria''\") in 1047.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Normans|last=Brown, R.

Under this state, there was great religious freedom, and alongside the Norman nobles existed a meritocratic bureaucracy of [[Jews]], [[Muslim]]s and Christians, both [[Catholicism|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]]. The Kingdom of Sicily thus became characterized by Norman, Byzantine, Greek, Arab, Lombard and \"native\" Sicilian populations living in harmony, and its [[List of monarchs of Sicily#Kings of Sicily|Norman rulers]] fostered plans of establishing an empire that would have encompassed [[Fatimid]] [[Egypt]] as well as the [[crusader states]] in the [[Levant]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url=http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9377080/Roger-II |title=Roger II \u2014King of Sicily |publisher=Concise.britannica.com |accessdate=2010-01-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523045823/http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9377080/Roger-II |archivedate=23 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D61331F935A15757C0A961948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2 |title=Tracing The Norman Rulers of Sicily |newspaper=New York Times |date=1987-04-26 |accessdate=2010-01-21 | first=Louis | last=Inturrisi}}</ref><ref>''Les Normands en Sicile'', p. 17.</ref> One of the great geographical treatises of the [[Middle Ages]], the \"''[[Tabula Rogeriana]]''\", was written by the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] [[al-Idrisi]] for King Roger II of Sicily, and entitled \"''Kitab Rudjdjar''\" (\"''The Book of Roger''\").<ref name=\"Lewis, p.148\">Lewis, p.148</ref>\n\n=== North Africa===\n{{See also|Kingdom of Africa}}\nBetween 1135 and 1160, the Norman kingdom of Sicily conquered and kept as vassals several cities on the [[Ifriqiya]] coast,  corresponding to Tunisia and parts of Algeria and Libya today.\nThey were lost to the Almohads.\n\n===Byzantium===\n{{See also|Byzantine-Norman wars|Varangian Guard|William Iron Arm}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2012}}\n{{context|section|date=December 2012}}\nSoon after the Normans began to enter Italy, they entered the [[Byzantine Empire]] and then [[Medieval Armenia|Armenia]], fighting against the [[Pechenegs]], the [[Bulgars]], and especially the [[Seljuk Turks]]. Norman mercenaries were first encouraged to come to the south by the Lombards to act against the Byzantines, but they soon fought in Byzantine service in Sicily. They were prominent alongside [[Varangian]] and Lombard contingents in the Sicilian campaign of [[George Maniaces]] in 1038\u201340. There is debate whether the Normans in Greek service actually were from Norman Italy, and it now seems likely only a few came from there. It is also unknown how many of the \"Franks\", as the Byzantines called them, were Normans and not other Frenchmen.\n\n[[File:Normannen.png|upright=1.15|thumb|Norman expansion by 1130]]\n\nOne of the first Norman mercenaries to serve as a Byzantine general was [[Herv\u00e9 (Norman)|Herv\u00e9]] in the 1050s. By then, however, there were already Norman mercenaries serving as far away as [[Trabzon|Trebizond]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. They were based at [[Malatya]] and [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], under the Byzantine duke of [[Antioch]], [[Isaac Komnenos, Duke of Antioch|Isaac Komnenos]]. In the 1060s, [[Robert Crispin]] led the Normans of Edessa against the Turks. [[Roussel de Bailleul]] even tried to carve out an independent state in [[Asia Minor]] with support from the local population, but he was stopped by the Byzantine general [[Alexius I Komnenos|Alexius Komnenos]].\n\nSome Normans joined Turkish forces to aid in the destruction of the Armenian vassal-states of [[Sassoun]] and [[Taron (historic Armenia)|Taron]] in far eastern [[Anatolia]]. Later, many took up service with the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenian state further south in Cilicia]] and the [[Taurus Mountains]]. A Norman named [[Roussel de Bailleul|Oursel]] led a force of \"Franks\" into the upper [[Euphrates]] valley in northern [[Syria]]. From 1073 to 1074, 8,000 of the 20,000 troops of the Armenian general [[Philaretus Brachamius]] were Normans\u2014formerly of Oursel\u2014led by [[Raimbaud]]. They even lent their ethnicity to the name of their castle: Afranji, meaning \"Franks\". The known trade between [[Republic of Amalfi|Amalfi]] and Antioch and between [[Bari]] and [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] may be related to the presence of Italo-Normans in those cities while Amalfi and Bari were under Norman rule in Italy.\n\nSeveral families of Byzantine Greece were of Norman mercenary origin during the period of the [[Comnenian Restoration]], when Byzantine emperors were seeking out western European warriors. The Raoulii were descended from an Italo-Norman named Raoul, the Petraliphae were descended from a Pierre d'Aulps, and that group of [[Albania]]n clans known as the Maniakates were descended from Normans who served under [[George Maniaces]] in the Sicilian expedition of 1038.\n\n[[Robert Guiscard]], another Norman adventurer previously elevated to the dignity of count of [[Apulia]] as the result of his military successes, ultimately drove the Byzantines out of southern [[Italy]]. Having obtained the consent of [[Pope Gregory VII]] and acting as his vassal, Robert continued his campaign conquering the Balkan peninsula as a foothold for western feudal lords and the Catholic Church. After allying himself with [[Kingdom of Croatia (925\u20131102)|Croatia]] and the Catholic cities of Dalmatia, in 1081 he led an army of 30,000 men in 300 ships landing on the southern shores of [[Albania]], capturing [[Vlora|Valona]], [[Kanin\u00eb|Kanina]], Jericho ([[Orikumi]]), and reaching [[Butrint]] after numerous pillages. They joined the fleet that had previously conquered [[Corfu]] and attacked [[Dyrrachium]] from land and sea, devastating everything along the way. Under these harsh circumstances, the locals accepted the call of Emperor [[Alexius I Comnenus]] to join forces with the Byzantines against the Normans. The [[Albania]]n forces could not take part in the ensuing [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (1081)|battle]] because it had started before their arrival. Immediately before the battle, the Venetian fleet had secured a victory in the coast surrounding the city. Forced to retreat, Alexius ceded the city of Dyrrachium to the [[Count of the Tent]] (or Byzantine provincial administrators) mobilizing from [[Arbanon]] (i.e., \u1f10\u03be \u1f08\u03c1\u03b2\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u1f41\u03c1\u03bc\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9 \u039a\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7; the term ''\u039a\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7'' is short for \u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 meaning \"Count of the Tent\").<ref>[[Anna Comnena]]. ''The Alexiad'', 4.8; {{harvnb|Vranousi|1962|pp=5\u201326}}.</ref> The city's garrison resisted until February 1082, when Dyrrachium was betrayed to the Normans by the Venetian and [[Amalfi]]tan merchants who had settled there. The Normans were now free to penetrate into the hinterland; they took Ioannina and some minor cities in southwestern Macedonia and Thessaly before appearing at the gates of Thessalonica. Dissension among the high ranks coerced the Normans to retreat to Italy. They lost Dyrrachium, Valona, and [[Butrint]] in 1085, after the death of Robert.\n\nA few years after the [[First Crusade]], in 1107, the Normans under the command of Bohemond, Robert's son, landed in Valona and besieged Dyrrachium using the most sophisticated military equipment of the time, but to no avail. Meanwhile, they occupied [[Petrela]], the citadel of Mili at the banks of the river [[Devoll (river)|Deabolis]], Gllavenica (Ballsh), Kanina and Jericho. This time, the Albanians sided with the Normans, dissatisfied by the heavy taxes the Byzantines had imposed upon them. With their help, the Normans secured the [[Arbanon]] passes and opened their way to Dibra. The lack of supplies, disease and Byzantine resistance forced Bohemond to retreat from his campaign and sign a peace treaty with the Byzantines in the city of Deabolis.\n\nThe further decline of Byzantine state-of-affairs paved the road to a third attack in 1185, when a large Norman army invaded [[Dyrrachium]], owing to the betrayal of high Byzantine officials. Some time later, Dyrrachium\u2014one of the most important naval bases of the [[Adriatic]]\u2014fell again to Byzantine hands.\n\n===England===\n<!--Tostig Godwinson links here-->\n{{See also|Norman conquest of England|William the Conqueror|Domesday Book|Anglo-Normans}}\n{{House of Normandy}}\nThe Normans were in contact with England from an early date. Not only were their original Viking brethren still ravaging the English coasts, they occupied most of the important ports opposite England across the [[English Channel]]. This relationship eventually produced closer ties of blood through the marriage of [[Emma of Normandy|Emma]], sister of Duke [[Richard II of Normandy]], and King [[Ethelred II of England]]. Because of this, Ethelred fled to Normandy in 1013, when he was forced from his kingdom by [[Sweyn Forkbeard]]. His stay in Normandy (until 1016) influenced him and his sons by Emma, who stayed in Normandy after [[Cnut the Great]]'s conquest of the isle.\n\nWhen [[Edward the Confessor]] finally returned from his father's refuge in 1041, at the invitation of his half-brother [[Harthacnut]], he brought with him a Norman-educated mind. He also brought many Norman counsellors and fighters, some of whom established an English cavalry force. This concept never really took root, but it is a typical example of Edward's attitude. He appointed [[Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges]] [[archbishop of Canterbury]] and made [[Ralph the Timid]] [[earl of Hereford]]. He invited his brother-in-law [[Eustace II, Count of Boulogne]] to his court in 1051, an event that resulted in the greatest of early conflicts between Saxon and Norman and ultimately resulted in the exile of Earl [[Godwin of Wessex]].\n\n[[File:Bayeux Tapestry scene19 detail Castle Dinan.jpg|upright=1.15|left|thumb|Siege of a [[motte-and-bailey]] castle from the [[Bayeux Tapestry]]]]\n\nOn 14 October 1066, [[William the Conqueror]] gained a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Hastings]], which led to the conquest of England three years later;<ref>''The Normans'', [[Marjorie Chibnall]]</ref> this can be seen on the [[Bayeux tapestry]] (a linen, embroidered cloth). The invading Normans and their descendants replaced the [[Anglo-Saxons]] as the ruling class of England. The nobility of England were part of a single Norman culture and many had lands on both sides of the channel. Early Norman kings of England, as Dukes of Normandy, owed homage to the King of France for their land on the continent. They considered England to be their most important holding (it brought with it the title of King\u2014an important status symbol).\n\nEventually, the Normans merged with the natives, combining languages and traditions, so much so that [[Marjorie Chibnall]] says \"writers still referred to Normans and English; but the terms no longer meant the same as in the immediate aftermath of 1066.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Normans|last=Chibnall|first=Marjorie|authorlink = Marjorie Chibnall|publisher=Blackwell publishing|year=2000|isbn=978-1-4051-4965-5|location=Oxford|pages=62|quote=|via=}}</ref> In the course of the [[Hundred Years' War]], the Norman aristocracy often identified themselves as English. The [[Anglo-Norman language]] became distinct from the [[Latin language]], something that was the subject of some humour by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]. The Anglo-Norman language was eventually absorbed into the Anglo-Saxon language of their subjects (see [[Old English]]) and influenced it, helping (along with the [[Norse language]] of the earlier [[Danelaw|Anglo-Norse]] settlers and the [[Ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]] used by the church) in the development of [[Middle English]]. It in turn evolved into [[Modern English]].\n\n===Ireland===\n{{See also|Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman Ireland|Normans in Ireland}}\n[[File:Trim Castle 6.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Norman keep in [[Trim, County Meath|Trim]], [[County Meath]]]]\nThe Normans had a profound effect on Irish culture and history after their invasion at [[Bannow Bay]] in 1169. Initially, the Normans maintained a distinct culture and ethnicity. Yet, with time, they came to be subsumed into Irish culture to the point that it has been said that they became \"[[More Irish than the Irish themselves (slogan)|more Irish than the Irish themselves]]\". The Normans settled mostly in an area in the east of [[Ireland]], later known as [[the Pale]], and also built many fine castles and settlements, including [[Trim Castle]] and [[Dublin Castle]]. Both cultures intermixed, borrowing from each other's language, culture and outlook. Norman descendants today can be recognised by their [[surnames]]. Names such as French, (De) Roche, Devereux, D'Arcy, Treacy and Lacy are particularly common in the southeast of Ireland, especially in the southern part of County [[Wexford]], where the first Norman settlements were established. Other Norman names, such as Furlong, predominate there. Another common Norman-Irish name was Morell (Murrell), derived from the French Norman name Morel. Names beginning with Fitz (from the Norman for son) usually indicate Norman ancestry. Except for the native surname Fitzpatrick, a [[Gallicisation|gallicisation]] of Mac Giolla Ph\u00e1draig/\u00d3 Maol Ph\u00e1draig. Hiberno-Norman surnames with the prefix - 'fitz' include [[FitzGerald dynasty|Fitzgerald]], FitzGibbons (Gibbons) dynasty, [[Fitzmaurice]]. Families bearing such surnames as [[Barry (name)|Barry (de Barra)]] and [[House of Burke|De B\u00farca (Burke)]] are also of Norman extraction.\n\n===Scotland===\n{{See also|Scotland in the High Middle Ages|Scoto-Norman}}\nOne of the claimants of the English throne opposing [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]], [[Edgar Atheling]], eventually fled to Scotland. King [[Malcolm III of Scotland]] married Edgar's sister [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Margaret]], and came into opposition to William who had already disputed Scotland's southern borders. William invaded Scotland in 1072, riding as far as [[Abernethy, Perth and Kinross|Abernethy]] where he met up with his fleet of ships. Malcolm submitted, paid homage to William and surrendered his son [[Duncan II of Scotland|Duncan]] as a hostage, beginning a series of arguments as to whether the Scottish Crown owed allegiance to the King of England.\n\nNormans went into Scotland, building castles and founding noble families that would provide some future kings, such as [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]], as well as founding a considerable number of the [[Scottish clan]]s. King [[David I of Scotland]], whose elder brother [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]] had married [[Sybilla of Normandy]], was instrumental in introducing Normans and Norman culture to [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], part of the process some scholars call the \"[[Davidian Revolution]]\". Having spent time at the court of [[Henry I of England]] (married to David's sister [[Edith of Scotland|Maud of Scotland]]), and needing them to wrestle the kingdom from his half-brother [[M\u00e1el Coluim mac Alaxandair]], David had to reward many with lands. The process was continued under David's successors, most intensely of all under [[William I of Scotland|William the Lion]]. The Norman-derived [[feudal]] system was applied in varying degrees to most of Scotland. Scottish families of the names [[Bruce (surname)|Bruce]], [[Gray (surname)|Gray]], Ramsay, Fraser, Rose, Ogilvie, Montgomery, Sinclair, Pollock, Burnard, Douglas and [[Gordon (surname)|Gordon]] to name but a few, and including the later royal [[House of Stewart]], can all be traced back to Norman ancestry.\n\n===Wales===\n{{See also|Norman invasion of Wales|Cambro-Norman}}\n[[File:Mms chepstow castle from river wye.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|[[Chepstow Castle]] in Wales, built by [[William fitzOsbern]] in 1067]]\nEven before the Norman Conquest of England, the Normans had come into contact with [[Wales]]. Edward the Confessor had set up the aforementioned Ralph as earl of Hereford and charged him with defending the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]] and warring with the Welsh. In these original ventures, the Normans failed to make any headway into Wales.\n\nSubsequent to the Conquest, however, the Marches came completely under the dominance of William's most trusted Norman barons, including [[Bernard de Neufmarch\u00e9]], [[Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury|Roger of Montgomery]] in [[Shropshire]] and [[Hugh, 1st Earl of Chester|Hugh Lupus]] in [[Cheshire]]. These Normans began a long period of slow conquest during which almost all of Wales was at some point subject to Norman interference. Norman words, such as ''baron'' (''barwn''), first entered [[Welsh language|Welsh]] at that time.\n\n===On crusade===\n{{See also|Principality of Antioch|Bohemund I of Antioch|Richard the Lion-Heart}}\nThe legendary religious zeal of the Normans was exercised in religious wars long before the [[First Crusade]] carved out a Norman [[Principality of Antioch|principality in Antioch]]. They were major foreign participants in the [[Reconquista]] in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]]. In 1018, [[Roger I of Tosny|Roger de Tosny]] travelled to the Iberian Peninsula to carve out a state for himself from [[Moorish]] lands, but failed. In 1064, during the [[War of Barbastro]], [[William of Montreuil]] led the papal army and took a huge booty.\n\nIn 1096, Crusaders passing by the siege of [[Amalfi]] were joined by [[Bohemund I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]] and his nephew [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]] with an army of Italo-Normans. Bohemond was the ''de facto'' leader of the Crusade during its passage through [[Asia Minor]]. After the successful [[Siege of Antioch]] in 1097, Bohemond began carving out an independent principality around that city. Tancred was instrumental in the conquest of [[Jerusalem]] and he worked for the expansion of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Crusader kingdom]] in [[Oultrejordain|Transjordan]] and the region of [[Galilee]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n===Anglo-Norman conquest of Cyprus===\n{{See also|Kingdom of Cyprus|Cyprus in the Middle Ages}}[[File:Lusignan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Illuminated manuscript showing king [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lion-hearted]] authorizing [[Guy de Lusignan]] to take [[Kingdom of Cyprus|Cyprus]]]]\nThe conquest of [[Cyprus]] by the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] forces of the [[Third Crusade]] opened a new chapter in the history of the island, which would be under [[Western Europe]]an domination for the following 380 years.

Richard then proceeded to conquer the whole island, his troops being led by Guy de Lusignan. Isaac surrendered and was confined with silver chains, because Richard had promised that he would not place him in irons. By 1 June, Richard had conquered the whole island. His exploit was well publicized and contributed to his reputation; he also derived significant financial gains from the conquest of the island.{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 138}} Richard left for [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] on 5 June, with his allies.{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 138}} Before his departure, he named two of his Norman generals, [[Richard de Camville]] and [[Robert of Thornham|Robert de Thornham]], as governors of Cyprus.\n\nWhile in Limassol, Richard the Lion-Heart married [[Berengaria of Navarre]], first-born daughter of King [[Sancho VI of Navarre]]. The wedding was held on 12 May 1191 at the Chapel of St. George and it was attended by Richard's sister [[Joan of England, Queen of Sicily|Joan]], whom he had brought from [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]]. The marriage was celebrated with great pomp and splendor. Among other grand ceremonies was a double coronation: Richard caused himself to be crowned [[King of Cyprus]], and Berengaria Queen of England and [[List of Cypriot consorts|Queen of Cyprus]] as well.\n\n[[File:Le Canarien.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Norman expeditionary ship depicted in the chronicle ''[[Le Canarien]]'' (1490)]]\n\nThe rapid Anglo-Norman conquest proved more important than it seemed.

Norman customary law was transcribed in two [[Coutume|customaries]] in [[Latin]] by two judges for use by them and their colleagues:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mondes-normands.caen.fr/angleterre/cultures/GB_FR/culture1_7.htm|title=Norman customary law|website=Mondes-normands.caen.fr|accessdate=20 May 2018}}</ref> These are the ''Tr\u00e8s ancien coutumier'' (''Very ancient customary''), authored between 1200 and 1245; and the ''Grand coutumier de Normandie'' (''Great customary of Normandy'', originally ''Summa de legibus Normanniae in curia la\u00efcali''), authored between 1235 and 1245.\n\n===Architecture===\n{{Main|Norman architecture}}\n[[File:Tower of London, Traitors Gate.jpg|thumb|A quintessential Norman keep: the [[Tower of London|White Tower]] in [[London]]]]\n\nNorman architecture typically stands out as a new stage in the architectural history of the regions they subdued. They spread a unique [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque idiom]] to England, Italy and Ireland, and the [[encastellation]] of these regions with [[keep]]s in their north French style fundamentally altered the military landscape. Their style was characterised by rounded [[arch]]es, particularly over windows and doorways, and massive proportions.\n\nIn England, the period of Norman architecture immediately succeeds that of the [[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Anglo-Saxon]] and precedes the [[Gothic architecture|Early Gothic]]. In southern Italy, the Normans incorporated elements of [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]], [[Lombardic architecture|Lombard]], and [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] building techniques into their own, initiating a unique style known as [[Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture#Norman-Arab-Byzantine architecture|Norman-Arab architecture]] within the [[Kingdom of Sicily]].<ref name=\"Sicily\" />\n\n===Visual arts===\nIn the visual arts, the Normans did not have the rich and distinctive traditions of the cultures they conquered. However, in the early 11th century the dukes began a programme of church reform, encouraging the [[Cluniac reform]] of monasteries and patronising intellectual pursuits, especially the proliferation of [[scriptoria]] and the reconstitution of a compilation of lost [[illuminated manuscript]]s. The church was utilised by the dukes as a unifying force for their disparate duchy. The chief monasteries taking part in this \"renaissance\" of Norman art and scholarship were [[Mont-Saint-Michel]], [[F\u00e9camp]], [[Jumi\u00e8ges]], [[Bec-de-Mortagne|Bec]], [[Saint-Ouen, Rouen|Saint-Ouen]], [[Saint-Evroul]], and [[Saint-Wandrille]]. These centres were in contact with the so-called \"[[Winchester]] school\", which channeled a pure [[Carolingian art]]istic tradition to Normandy. In the final decade of the 11th and first of the 12th century, Normandy experienced a golden age of illustrated manuscripts, but it was brief and the major scriptoria of Normandy ceased to function after the midpoint of the century.\n\n[[File:Lion, Norman Italy 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A bronze lion sculpture attributed to an [[Italo-Norman]] artist. Now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]\n\nThe [[French Wars of Religion]] in the 16th century and the [[French Revolution]] in the 18th successively destroyed much of what existed in the way of the architectural and artistic remnant of this Norman creativity. The former, with their violence, caused the wanton destruction of many Norman edifices; the latter, with its assault on religion, caused the purposeful destruction of religious objects of any type, and its destabilisation of society resulted in rampant pillaging.\n\nBy far the most famous work of Norman art is the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], which is not a [[tapestry]] but a work of [[embroidery]]. It was commissioned by [[Odo of Bayeux|Odo]], the [[Bishop of Bayeux]] and first [[Earl of Kent]], employing natives from [[Kent]] who were learned in the Nordic traditions imported in the previous half century by the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danish]] [[Vikings]].\n\nIn Britain, Norman art primarily survives as [[stonework]] or [[metalwork]], such as [[capital (column)|capitals]] and [[baptismal font]]s. In southern Italy, however, Norman artwork survives plentifully in forms strongly influenced by its Greek, Lombard, and Arab forebears. Of the royal regalia preserved in Palermo, the crown is Byzantine in style and the coronation cloak is of Arab craftsmanship with [[Arabic language|Arabic]] inscriptions. Many churches preserve sculptured fonts, capitals, and more importantly mosaics, which were common in Norman Italy and drew heavily on the Greek heritage. Lombard Salerno was a centre of [[ivory]]work in the 11th century and this continued under Norman domination. The intercourse between French Crusaders traveling to the Holy Land who brought with them French artefacts with which to gift the churches at which they stopped in southern Italy amongst their Norman cousins. For this reason many south Italian churches preserve works from France alongside their native pieces.\n\n===Music===\n[[File:David on harp.jpg|thumb|An illuminated manuscript from [[Saint-Evroul]] depicting [[King David]] on the lyre (or harp) in the middle of the back of the initial 'B']]\nNormandy was the site of several important developments in the history of [[classical music]] in the 11th century. [[F\u00e9camp Abbey]] and [[Saint-Evroul Abbey]] were centres of musical production and education. At F\u00e9camp, under two Italian abbots, [[William of Volpiano]] and John of Ravenna, the system of denoting notes by letters was developed and taught. It is still the most common form of pitch representation in English- and German-speaking countries today. Also at F\u00e9camp, the [[Staff (music)|staff]], around which [[neume]]s were oriented, was first developed and taught in the 11th century. Under the German abbot [[Isembard of La Trinit\u00e9-du-Mont|Isembard]], [[La Trinit\u00e9-du-Mont]] became a centre of musical composition.\n\nAt Saint Evroul, a tradition of singing had developed and the choir achieved fame in Normandy. Under the Norman abbot [[Robert de Grantmesnil]], several monks of Saint-Evroul fled to southern Italy, where they were patronised by Robert Guiscard and established a Latin monastery at [[Lamezia Terme#Sant'Eufemia Lamezia|Sant'Eufemia Lamezia]]. There they continued the tradition of singing.\n\n==Rulers==\n* [[Dukes of Normandy#Succession of the Dukes of Normandy|List of Dukes of Normandy]]\n* [[Count of Apulia|List of Counts and Dukes of Apulia and Calabria]]\n* [[List of Counts of Aversa]]\n* [[List of Princes of Capua]]\n* [[List of Hypati and Dukes of Gaeta|List of Dukes of Gaeta]]\n* [[Principality of Taranto#Hauteville (Altavilla) dynasty|List of Princes of Taranto]]\n* [[List of monarchs of Sicily]]\n* [[Principality of Antioch#Princes of Antioch, 1098\u20131268|List of Princes of Antioch]]\n* [[Officers of the Principality of Antioch|List of Officers of the Principality of Antioch]]\n* [[Lusignan dynasty#Second House of Lusignan|Second House of Lusignan]]\n* [[List of English monarchs#Normans|List of English Monarchs]]\n* [[List of Scottish monarchs]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture|France}}\n* [[House of Normandy]]\n* [[Norman language]]\n* [[Norsemen]]\n* [[Rus' people]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n\n===Primary===\n* {{Citation | editor-first = Elisabeth | editor-last = van Houts | title = The Normans in Europe | publisher = Manchester Medieval Sources | place = Manchester | year = 2000}}.\n* {{Citation | url = http://www.leeds.ac.uk/history/weblearning/MedievalHistoryTextCentre/medievalTexts.htm | title = Medieval History Texts in Translation | publisher = [[University of Leeds]]}}.\n\n===Secondary===\n* {{Citation | last = Bates | first = David | title = Normandy before 1066 | place = London | year = 1982}}\n* {{Citation | first = R.
