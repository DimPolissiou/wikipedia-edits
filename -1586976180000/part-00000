The station would therefore have to be located on the edge of Thornbury at a significant distance from the town centre, making it less attractive to passengers. The Grovesend tunnel would also need to be reopened, with its current condition unknown, and there would be capacity constraints at Westerleigh Junction. This led to the Authority deciding not to pursue reopening the line. FOSBR continue to advocate reopening the line in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fosbr.org.uk/files/newsletter/FOSBR_Newsletter_95_201710.pdf|title=October 2017 - Issue 95(V2)|website=FOSBR|date= October 2017|accessdate=25 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Greater Bristol]]\n*[[MetroBus (Bristol)]]\n*[[Transport in Bristol]]\n*[[Urban rail in the United Kingdom]]\n*[[Rail services in the West of England]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Rail transport in Bristol}}\n* {{Official website|https://travelwest.info/projects/metrowest}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035459/http://travelwest.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/overview-of-metrowest.pdf  MetroWest: Investing in our local rail network], June 2014\n* [http://www.fosbr.org.uk/ Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways (FOSBR)]\n\n{{Proposed rail infrastructure projects in the United Kingdom}}\n{{Transport in Bristol}}\n\n[[Category:Rail transport in Bristol]]\n[[Category:Proposed railway lines in England]]\n", "name_user": "Ira Leviton", "label": "safe", "comment": "Deleted a duplicate \"the\".", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetroWest_(Bristol)"}
