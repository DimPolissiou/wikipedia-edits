By promising to continue the peace talks which Johnson began in May 1968 in Paris Nixon admitted that he had ruled out \"a military victory\" in Vietnam..{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=582}} Nixon wanted a diplomatic settlement similar to the armistice of Panmunjom that ended the Korean War and frequently stated in private he had no intention of being \"the first president of the United States to lose a war\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=582}} To force the North Vietnamese to sign an armistice, Nixon favored a two-pronged approach of the \"madman theory\" of seeking to act rashly to intidimate the North Vietnamese while at the same time trying using the strategy of \"linkage\" to improve relations with the Soviet Union and China in order to persuade both these nations to stop sending arms to North Vietnam..{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=582\u2013583}}  In office, and assisted by Kissinger, Nixon implemented a policy of [[Vietnamization]] that aimed to gradually withdraw U.S. troops while expanding the combat role of the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|South Vietnamese Army]] so that it would be capable of independently defending its government against the [[Viet Cong|National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam]], a Communist guerrilla organization, and the North Vietnamese army ([[Vietnam People's Army]] or PAVN).\n\nIn an article published in ''Foreign Affairs'' in January 1969, Kissinger criticized General William Westmoreland's attrition strategy because the Vietnamese Communists were willing to accept far higher losses on the battlefield than the United States and could therefore \"win\" as long as they did not \"lose\" by merely keeping the war going.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=588}} In the same article, he argued that losses endured by the Vietnamese Communists in the Tet Offensive were meaningless as the Tet Offensive had turned American public opinion against the war, ruling out the possibility of a military solution, and the best that could be done now was to negotiate the most favorable peace settlement at the Paris peace talks.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=587}} Kissinger, when he came into office in 1969 favored a negotiating strategy under which the United States and North Vietnam would sign an armistice and agreed to pull their troops out of South Vietnam while the South Vietnamese government and the Viet Cong were to agree to a coalition government.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=588}} Kissinger had doubts about Nixon's theory of \"linkage\", believing that this would give the Soviet Union leverage over the United States and unlike Nixon was less concerned about the ultimate fate of South Vietnam.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=588\u2013589}} One of Kissinger's first acts as National Security Adviser in early 1969 was to seek opinions of the Vietnam experts within the CIA, the military and the State Department.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=589}} The lengthy volume that emerged contained a diverse collection of opinions with some stating the South Vietnamese were making \"rapid strides\" while others doubted that the government in Saigon would \"ever constitute an effective political or military counter to the Vietcong\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=589}} The \"bulls\" estimated that American troops would need to fight on in Vietnam for 8.3 years before the South Vietnamese would be able to fight on their own while the \"bears\" estimated it take 13.4 years of American troops fighting in Vietnam before the South Vietnamese would be able to fight on their own.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=589}} Kissinger passed the volume on to Nixon with the comment that there was no consensus within the expert community with the implied conclusion that he should be free on his own without consulting the experts.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=589}}\n\nIn early 1969, Kissinger was opposed to the plans for [[Operation Menu]], the bombing of Cambodia, fearing that Nixon was acting rashly with no plans for the diplomatic fall-out, but on 16 March 1969 Nixon at a meeting at the White House attended by Kissinger announced the bombing would start the next day.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=591}} As Congress was unlikely to grant approval to bombing Cambodia, Nixon decided to go ahead without Congressional approval and keep the bombings secret, a decision that several constitutional law experts argued was illegal.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=592}} In May 1969, the bombing was leaked to [[William M. Beecher]] of the ''New York Times'' who published an article about it, which infuriated Kissinger.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=592}} At the time, Kissinger told the FBI director J.E. Hoover \"we will destroy whoever did this\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=592}} As a result, the phones of 13 members of Kissinger's staff were taped by the FBI without a warrant.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=592}} At the time, Kissinger portrayed himself to his friends at Harvard as a moderating force who was working to remove the United States from Vietnam, saying he did not want to end up like his predecessor W.W. Rostow, whose actions as National Security Adviser had caused him to be ostracized by the liberal American intelligentsia.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}}\n\nAs part of the \"linkage\" concept, Kissinger in March 1969 sent [[Cyrus Vance]] to Moscow with the message that if the Soviet Union pressured North Vietnam into a diplomatic settlement favorable to the United States, the reward would be concessions on the talks on limiting the nuclear arms race.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=592\u2013593}} At the same time, Kissinger met with the Soviet ambassador [[Anatoly Dobrynin]] to warn him that Nixon was a dangerous man who wanted to escalate the Vietnam war.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=593}} Nixon and Kissinger played a \"good cop-bad cop\" routine with Dobrynin with Nixon acting the part of the petulant president at the end of his patience with North Vietnam while Kissinger acted as the reasonable diplomat anxious to improve relations with the Soviet Union, saying to Dobrynin in May 1969 that Nixon would \"escalate the war\" if the Soviet Union \"didn't produce a settlement\" in Vietnam.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=595}} At another meeting in 1969, Kissinger warned Dobrynin that \"the train has just left the station and is now headed down the track\", saying the Soviet Union better start pressuring North Vietnam now before Nixon did something truly reckless and dangerous.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=593}} The attempt at \"linkage\" failed as the Soviet Union did not pressure North Vietnam and instead Dobrynin told Kissinger that the Soviets wanted better relations with the United States regardless of the Vietnam war.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=593}} After the failure of the \"linkage\" attempt, Nixon became more open to the alternative strategy suggested by the Defense Secretary [[Melvin Laird]] who argued that the burden of the war should be shifted to the South Vietnamese, which was initially called \"de-Americanization\" and which Laird renamed Vietnamization because it sounded better.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=594}}\n\nOn 4 August 1969, Kissinger met secretly with [[Xu\u00e2n Th\u1ee7y]] at the Paris apartment of [[Jean Sainteny]] to discuss peace.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=597}} Kissinger repeated the American offer of \"mutual withdrawal\" of U.S and North Vietnamese forces from South Vietnam which Th\u1ee7y rejected while Th\u1ee7y demanded a new government in Saigon which Kissinger rejected.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=597}} &nbsp;Kissinger had a low opinion of North Vietnam, saying \"I can't believe that a fourth-rate power like North Vietnam doesn't have a breaking point\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}} Kissinger was opposed to the strategy of Vietnamization, expressing some doubt about the ability of the ARVN (Army of the Republic of Vietnam-i.e. the South Vietnamese Army) to hold the field, causing much tension with Defense Secretary Laird who was deeply committed to Vietnamization.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}}  In September 1969, Kissinger in a memo advised Nixon against \"de-escalation\", saying that keeping U.S troops fighting in Vietnam \"remains one of our few bargaining weapons\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}} In the same memo, Kissinger stated he was \"deeply disturbed\" that Nixon had started pulling out U.S. troops, saying that withdrawing the troops was like \"salted peanuts\" to the American people, \"the more U.S troops come home, the more will be demanded\", giving the advantage to the enemy who merely had to \"wait us out\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}} Instead, he recommenced that the United States resume bombing North Vietnam and mine the coast.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}} Later in September 1969, Kissinger proposed a plan for what he called a \"savage, punishing\" blow against North Vietnam code-named [[Duck Hook]] to Nixon, arguing that this was the best way to force North Vietnam to agree to peace on American terms.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}} Laird was strongly opposed to Duck Hook, warning Nixon that the use of nuclear weapons to kill a massive number of North Vietnamese civilians would alienate American public opinion from the administration and persuaded Nixon to reject it.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}} Reflecting his background as a Harvard professor of political science who belonged to the ''Primat der Aussenpolitik'' school which saw foreign policy as belonging only to a small elite, Kissinger was less sensitive to public opinion than Laird, a former Republican congressman who constantly advised Nixon to keep American public opinion in mind.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}}\n\nKissinger played a key role in [[Operation Menu|bombing Cambodia]] to disrupt PAVN and Viet Cong units launching raids into South Vietnam from within Cambodia's borders and resupplying their forces by using the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]] and other routes, as well as the 1970 [[Cambodian Incursion]] and subsequent widespread bombing of [[Khmer Rouge]] targets in Cambodia. The Paris peace talks had become stalemated by late 1969 owing to the obstructionism of the South Vietnamese delegation who wanted the talks to fail.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=624}} The South Vietnamese President [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u]] did not want the United States to withdraw from Vietnam, and out of frustration with him, Kissinger decided to begin secret peace talks in Paris parallel to the official talks that the South Vietnamese were unaware of.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=623}} On 21 February 1970, Kissinger secretly met in a modest house in a Paris suburb [[L\u00ea \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1ecd]], the North Vietnamese diplomat who was to become his most tenacious adversary.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=623}} In 1981, Kissinger told the journalist [[Stanley Karnow]]: \"I don't look back on our meetings with any great joy, yet he was a person of substance and discipline who defended the position he represented with dedication\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=623}} Not until February 1971 were Rogers and Laird first informed of the parallel peace talks in Paris.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=623}} Kissinger was to meet Tho three times between February-April 1970, and the North Vietnamese first sensed a softening of the American position during these talks as Kissinger slightly altered the \"mutual withdrawal formula\" that the Americans had previously held to.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=625}}&nbsp;Nixon was gravely disappointed that the secret talks in Paris did not have the prompt results he wanted.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=607}} Kissinger wrote in his memoirs that \"historians rarely do justice to the psychological stress on a policy-maker\", noting that by early 1970 Nixon was feeling very much besieged and inclined to lash out against a world he was believed was plotting his downfall.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=606}} Nixon had become obsessed with the film ''Patton'', seeing how the film presented Patton as a solitary and misunderstood genius whom the world did not appreciate a parallel to himself and kept watching the film over and over again.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=607}}\n\nOn 18 March 1970, the Prime Minister of Cambodia, [[Lon Nol]] carried out a coup against King Sihanouk and ultimately declared Cambodia a republic.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=604\u2013605}} Out of fury with Lon Nol, the king went to Beijing where he allied himself to his former enemies, the Khmer Rouge, calling upon the Khmer people to \"liberate our motherland\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=606}} As the most of the Khmer peasantry regarded the king as a god-like figure, the royal endorsement of the Khmer Rouge had immediate results. Cambodia had descended into chaos by late March 1970 as Lon Nol regime to prove its nationalist credibility organized pogroms against the Vietnamese minority, leading the North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong to attack and defeat Cambodia's weak army.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=606}} Nixon believed in the situation in Cambodia offered the chance for him to be like Patton by doing something bold and risky.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=606\u2013607}} Kissinger was initially ambivalent about Nixon's plans to invade Cambodia, but as he saw the president was committed, he became more and more supportive.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=608}} On 23 April 1970, Nixon in a memo to Kissinger declared \"we need a bold move in Cambodia to show that we stand with Lon Nol\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=608}}\n\nOn 26 April 1970, Nixon decided to \"go for broke\" by invading Cambodia with U.S troops.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=608}} When Nixon's speech-writer [[William Safire]] pointed out that the use of U.S. troops violated the Nixon Doctrine that America's Asian allies should do the fighting, Kissinger snapped at him: \"We wrote the goddamn doctrine, we can change it!\"{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=609}} Kissinger was under immense strain as several of his aides were planning to resign to protest the invasion of Cambodia, his liberal friends from Harvard were pressuring him to resign as well while Nixon was all for more belligerence.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=609}} Kissinger received a phone call from Nixon and his best friend, [[Bebe Rebozo|Charles \"Bebe\" Rebozo]], who both sounded very drunk; Nixon began the call and then handed the phone to Rebozo who said: \"The President wants you to know if this doesn't work, Henry, it's your ass\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=609}} On 30 April 1970, the United States invaded Cambodia which Nixon announced in a television address that Kissinger contemptuously called \"vintage Nixon\" because of his overblown rhetoric.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=609}} At the time, Nixon was seen as recklessly escalating the war and in early May 1970 the largest protests ever against the Vietnam war took place.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=611}} Four of Kissinger's aides resigned in protest while the Cambodian \"incursion\" ended several of Kissinger's friendships with colleagues from Harvard when he chose not to resign.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=611}} Nixon in his memoirs claimed that Kissinger \"took a particularly hard line\" with regards to the \"Cambodian incursion\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=611}} Roger Morris, one of Kissinger's aides later recalled that he was frightened by the huge anti-war demonstrations, comparing the antiwar movement to Nazis.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=611}} Kissinger was haunted by memories of his youth in Germany, and had a deep distrust of mass movements of either the left or the right, favoring the Primat der Aussenpolitik school of foreign-policy making by an elite with the masses excluded. In his interview with Karnow, Kissinger maintained he felt torn about where he stood and blamed Nixon for his failure to find \"the language of respect and compassion that might have created a bridge at least to the more reasonable elements of the antiwar movement\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=611}}\n\nThe Cambodian \"incursion\" saw American and South Vietnamese take the areas of eastern Cambodia that American commanders called the Fish Hook and Parrot's Beak and captured an impressive haul of arms originating from China and the Soviet Union.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=609\u2013610}} But the majority of Vietnamese Communist forces had withdrawn deeper into Cambodia before the invasion with only a small number left behind to wage a fighting retreat to avoid charges of cowardice.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=609\u2013610}} In June 1970, the Americans pulled out of Cambodia and the Vietnamese Communists returned, through the loss of weapons greatly hindered their operations in the Saigon area for the rest of 1970.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=610 & 625}} Having committed itself to supporting Lon Nol, the United States now had two allies instead of one to support in Southeast Asia.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=612}}\n\nThe bombing campaign in Cambodia contributed to the chaos of the [[Cambodian Civil War]], which saw the forces of leader [[Lon Nol]] unable to retain foreign support to combat the growing Khmer Rouge insurgency that would overthrow him in 1975.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Totten |first1=Samuel |last2=Parsons |first2=William S. |last3=Charny |first3=Israel W. |title=Century of Genocide: Critical Essays and Eyewitness Accounts |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2004 |page=349 |isbn=978-0-415-94430-4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5Ef8Hrx8Cd0C&pg=PA349 |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Smyth |first1=Marie |last2=Robinson |first2=Gillian |title=Researching Violently Divided Societies: Ethical and Methodological Issues |publisher=[[United Nations University Press]] |year=2001 |page=93 |isbn=978-92-808-1065-3 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZWqNwsv6AIQC&pg=PA93 |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}</ref> Documents uncovered from the Soviet archives after 1991 reveal that the North Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1970 was launched at the explicit request of the Khmer Rouge and negotiated by [[Pol Pot]]'s then second in command, [[Nuon Chea]].<ref>Dmitry Mosyakov, \"The Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese Communists: A History of Their Relations as Told in the Soviet Archives\", in Susan E.

The ARVN invaded Laos on 8 February 1971 and were stopped decisively by the North Vietnamese.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=629\u2013630}} In March, Kissinger sent his deputy Haig to inspect the situation personally, leading him to report that the ARVN officers lacked courage and did not want to fight, making retreat the only option.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=630}}&nbsp;The retreat when it began turned into a rout.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=630}} Kissinger wrote Lam Son had fallen \"far short of our expectations\", which he blamed on bad American planning, poor South Vietnamese tactics and Nixon's leadership style, leading Karnow to write he blamed \"everyone, characteristically, except himself\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=631}}\n\nIn late May 1971, Kissinger returned to Paris to fruitlessly meet again with Tho.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} The North Vietnamese demand that Thi\u1ec7u step down proved to the main obstacle.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} Kissinger did not want a repeat of the prolonged bout of political instability that characterized South Vietnam from 1963 to 1967 and believed Thi\u1ec7u was a force for order.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} Tho suggested to Kissinger that Americans \"stop supporting\"  Thi\u1ec7u who was running for the reelection in a ballot scheduled for 3 October 1971.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} Tho claimed that Thi\u1ec7u's opponents, Air Marshal [[Nguy\u1ec5n Cao K\u1ef3]] and General [[D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh]] aka \"Big Minh\", were both open to a coalition government with the Viet Cong and had if either men were elected president, the war would be over by late 1971.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} Thi\u1ec7u used a legal technicality to disqualify K\u1ef3 while Minh dropped out when it was clear the election was rigged.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} In the 1971 election, the CIA donated money for Thi\u1ec7u's reelection campaign while the Americans did not pressure Thi\u1ec7u to stop rigging the election.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}} Through Kissinger did not regard South Vietnam as important in its own right, he believed it was necessary to support South Vietnam to maintain the United States as a global power, believing that none of America's allies would trust the United States if South Vietnam were abandoned too quickly.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} Kissinger also believed that if South Vietnam were to collapse, it \"leave deep scars on our society, feeling impulses for recrimination\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} As a Jew who had grown up in Nazi Germany, Kissinger was haunted by how the ''Dolchsto\u00dflegende'' had used by the German right to delegitimatize the Weimar Republic, and believed that something similar would happen in the United States should it lose the Vietnam War, fueling the rise of right-wing extremism.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}}\n\nIn June 1971, Kissinger supported Nixon's effort to ban the [[Pentagon Papers]] saying the \"hemorrhage of state secrets\" to the media was making diplomacy impossible.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=633}} [[Daniel Ellsberg]], the man who leaked the Pentagon Papers to the ''New York Times'' had been consulted by Kissinger for ideas about Vietnam in late 1968-early 1969, but when he leaked the papers, Kissinger told Nixon that he was a left-wing \"fanatic\" and a \"drug abuser\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=633}} Kissinger depicted Ellsberg to Nixon as a drug-crazed degenerate of questionable mental stability out to ruin his administration. Reflecting his increasingly frustration with the war, Nixon often talked to Kissinger in a bloodthirsty manner about a \"fantasy holocaust\" in which he would have U.S. forces kill every living thing in North Vietnam and then pull out, leading the latter appalled by his own account.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}}\n\nBy early 1972, Nixon boosted that he had pulled out 400, 000 U.S soldiers from Vietnam since July 1969, and battle deaths had fallen from an average of 200 per week in 1969 down to an average of 10 per week in 1972.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}} The policy of Vietnamization had, as Laird predicted it would, tamed the antiwar movement as most Americans objected not to war in Vietnam per se, only to Americans dying in it.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}} With the antiwar movement in decline by 1972, Nixon believed his chances of reelection were good, but Kissinger kept complaining that he was losing \"negotiating assets\" in his talks with Tho every time a withdrawal of American forces was announced.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}}  Likewise, Kissinger noted that the major reason why Congress despite the antiwar feelings of many of its members kept voting to fund the war was because the argument it was patriotic to support \"our boys in the field\"; as more Americans were pulled out, Congress was less inclined to vote to fund keeping South Vietnamese \"boys in the field\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}} However, the imperatives of being re-elected was far more important to Nixon than with giving Kissinger \"negotiating assets\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}} In early 1972, Nixon publicly revealed that Kissinger had secretly negotiating with Tho since 1970 to prove that he was really was committed to peace in Vietnam despite what the antiwar movement had been saying about him for the last three years.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}} Reflecting Kissinger's weakening hand in his talks with Tho, Nixon had increasingly come by 1971\u201372 to believe that \"linkage\" concept of improving relations with the Soviet Union and China in exchange for those nations cutting off the supply of weapons to North Vietnam offered his best chance of a favorable peace deal.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}}\n\nOn 21 February 1972 was in Nixon's words \"the week that changed the world\" as he landed in Beijing to meet [[Mao Zedong]].{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=638}} Kissinger who accompanied Nixon to China spent much time talking to the suave Chinese Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] about Vietnam, pressing him to end the supply of arms to North Vietnam.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=638}} The talks went nowhere as Zhou told Kissinger that the North Vietnamese played off China against the Soviet Union, and to cut off North Vietnam would allow it to fall into the Soviet sphere of influence.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=638}} As the Chinese People's Liberation Army had badly bloodied by the Red Army in a border war in 1969, Zhou stated that to face a two-front war with Chinese forces facing North Vietnam in the south and the Soviet Union in the north was not acceptable to his government.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=638}} Zhou offered Kissinger only the vague message that China supported efforts to find peace in Vietnam while refusing to make any promises, though Kissinger also noted that Zhou declined to endorse North Vietnam's demands.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=638}} Despite Nixon's coming visit, in late 1971 the Chinese drastically increased their military aid to North Vietnam and continued to send a massive amount of weapons south even as Nixon and Kissinger exchanged pleasantries with Mao and Zhou in Beijing.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=639}}&nbsp;As usual, when the Chinese increased their supply of arms to North Vietnam, the Soviet Union did likewise as both Communist states competed with one another for influence in Hanoi by tying to be the biggest supplier of weapons.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=639}} On 30 March 1972, the PAVN launched the [[Easter Offensive]] that overran several provinces in South Vietnam while pushing the ARVN to the brink of collapse.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=640\u2013642}}\n\nAt the time of the Easter Offensive, Kissinger was deeply involved in planning for Nixon's visit to Moscow in May 1972. The offensive brought to the fore the differences between Nixon and Kissinger. Nixon threatened to cancel his summit with [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in Moscow if the Soviet Union did not force North Vietnam to end the Easter Offensive at once, saying: \"Whatever else happens, we cannot lose this war. The summit isn't worth a damn if the price for it is losing in Vietnam\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=644}} Nixon in his instructions to Kissinger stated that he viewed the relations with the Soviet Union through the prism of the Vietnam war and if the Soviets were not prepared to help, Kissinger \"should just pack up and come home\"..{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=644}} Kissinger for his part believed that Nixon was massively exaggerating Soviet influence in North Vietnam and not longer believed if he ever did in Nixon's \"linkage\" concept.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=644}} Kissinger feared that Nixon was obsessed with Vietnam and damaging relations with the Soviet Union over Vietnam would destabilize the international power balance by increasing American-Soviet tensions.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=644}} On 20 April 1972, Kissinger arrived in Moscow without informing the U.S. ambassador [[Jacob D. Beam]], and then went to have tea with Brezhnev in the Kremlin.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=644}} Nixon as usual when under stress departed for a marathon drinking session with Rebozo at Camp David, and via Haig kept sending messages to Kissinger to be tough with Brezhnev.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=644}} As no American president had ever visited Moscow before, Kissinger got the impression that Brezhnev wanted the planned summit to happen \"at almost any cost\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=644}} Kissinger's implemented Nixon's emphasis on building an amicable personal relationship with Brezhnev.<ref>Barbara Keys,  \"Nixon/Kissinger and Brezhnev.\" ''Diplomatic History'' 42.4 (2018): 548-551.</ref>  Upon his return to Washington, Kissinger reported that Brezhnev would not cancel the summit and was keen to sign the SALT I Treaty.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} Kissinger went to Paris on 3 May to meet Tho with orders from Nixon that North Vietnam must \"Settle or else!\"{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} Nixon complained that Kissinger was \"obsessed\" with the need for a peace treaty while he charged that he now wished he followed his instincts to bomb North Vietnam in 1970, saying if he had done so, the war would have been over by now.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} On 2 May 1972, the PAVN had captured Quangtri, an important provincial city in South Vietnam, and as a result of this victory, Tho was in no mood for a compromise.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} Through Kissinger in general shared Nixon's determination to be tough, he was afraid that the president would overreact and destroy the budding d\u00e9tente with the Soviet Union and China by striking too hard at North Vietnam.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} Moreover, after the rupture caused by the Cambodian incursion, Kissigner was trying hard to rebuilt his relations with the liberal American intelligentsia, saying he did want to become \"this administration's Walt Rostow\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} Kissinger's predecessor, Rostow had once being a professor at Harvard, Oxford the MIT, and Cambridge, but serving as the National Security Adviser had shunned by the Ivy League universities and ended up at the lowly University of Texas, a fate that Kissinger was determined to avoid.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} On 5 May 1972, Nixon ordered the U.S. Air Force to start bombing Hanoi and Haiphong and on 8 May ordered the U.S Navy to mine the coast of North Vietnam.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} As the bombings and mining of North Vietnam, Nixon and even more so Kissinger waited anxiously for the Soviet reaction, and much to their relief received only the standard statement decrying the American action and a diplomatic note complaining that American aircraft had bombed a Soviet freighter in Haiphong harbor.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=646}} The Moscow summit was not canceled.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=646}}\n\nOn 24 July 1972, Congress passed an act calling for the total withdraw of all American forces from Vietnam once all of the American POWs in North Vietnam were released, causing Kissinger to say the North Vietnamese only had to wait until \"Congress voted us of the war\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=646}} However, the sight of Nixon and Kissinger posing for photographs with Brezhnev and Mao deeply worried the North Vietnamese who were afraid of being \"sold out\" by either China and/or the Soviet Union, causing some flexibility in their negotiating tactics.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=646}} The Eastern Offensive had not caused the collapse of the South Vietnamese government, but it increased the amount of territory under Communist control.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=647}} The North Vietnamese were moving towards taking up the \"standstill ceasefire\" offer and ordered the Viet Cong to seize as much territory as possible in preparation for a \"leopard's spot\" ceasefire (so called because the patchwork of territories controlled by the Viet Cong and the Saigon government resembled the spots on a leopard's fur).{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=647}} On 1 August 1972, Kissinger met Tho again in Paris, and for first time, he seemed willing to compromise, saying that political and military terms of an armistice could be treated separately and hinted that his government was no longer willing to make the overthrow of Thi\u1ec7u a precondition.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=647}}\n\nOn the evening of 8 October 1972 at a secret meeting of Kissinger and Tho in a house in the Paris suburb of Gif-sur-Yvette once owned by the painter Fernard L\u00e9ger&nbsp;came the decisive breakthrough in the talks.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=647\u2013648}} Tho believed that Kissinger was as he later it put \"in a rush\"&nbsp;for a peace deal before the presidential election, and began with he called \"a very realistic and very simple proposal\" for a ceasefire that would see the Americans pull all their forces out of Vietnam in exchange for the release of all the POWs in North Vietnam.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=648}} As for the ultimate fate of South Vietnam, Tho proposed the creation of a \"council of national reconciliation\" that would govern the nation, but in the meantime Thi\u1ec7u could stay in power until the council was formed while a \"leopard's spot\" ceasefire would come into effect with the Viet Cong and the Saigon government controlling whatever territories they were had at the time of the ceasefire.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=648}} The \"mutual withdrawal formula\" was to be disregarded with PAVN forces to stay in South Vietnam with Tho giving Kissinger a vague promise that no more supplies would be sent down the Ho Chi Minh Trail.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=648}} Kissinger accepted Tho's offer as the most best deal possible, saying that the \"mutual withdrawal formula\" had to be abandoned as it been \"unobtainable through ten years of war...We could not make it a condition for a final settlement. We had long passed that threshold\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=648}} Several of Kissinger's own staff, most notably [[John Negroponte]], were strongly opposed to him accepting this offer, saying Kissinger had given away more than he had obtained.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=648}} In response to Negronponte's objections, Kissinger exploded in rage, accusing him of \"nit-picking\" and screamed at the top of his voice: \"You don't understand. I want to meet their terms. I want to reach an agreement. I want to end this war before the election. It can be done and it will be done...What do you want us to do? Stay there forever?\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=648}}\n\nReflecting the \"leopard's spot\" ceasefire, Kissinger sent Thi\u1ec7u a message saying he should \"seize as much territory as possible\" before the ceasefire came into effect while the United States launched Operation Enhance Plus to give South Vietnam as many weapons as possible.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=648\u2013649}} Over the course of six weeks in the fall of 1972, South Vietnam ended up with the world's fourth largest air force as the Americans provided as war planes as possibly could.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=649}} However, neither Kissinger nor Nixon appreciated that for Thi\u1ec7u any sort of peace deal calling for withdrawal of American forces was unacceptable and he saw the draft peace agreement that Kissinger signed in Paris on 18 October 1972 as a betrayal.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=650}} On 21 October Kissinger together with the American ambassador Ellsworth Bunker arrived at the Gia Long Palace in Saigon to show Thi\u1ec7u the peace agreement.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=650}} The meeting went extremely badly with Thi\u1ec7u engaged that Kissinger did not take the time to translate the draft peace treaty into Vietnamese, bringing with him only an English language copy.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=650}}&nbsp;The meeting went from bad to worse with Thi\u1ec7u having a meltdown as he broke down in tears and hysterically accused Kissinger of plotting with the Soviet Union and China to betray him, saying he could never accept this peace agreement.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=650}} Thi\u1ec7u refused to sign the peace agreement and demanded very extensive amendments that Kissinger reported to Nixon \"verge on insanity\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=650}} Nixon ordered Kissinger to \"push Thi\u1ec7u as far as possible\", but Thi\u1ec7u refused to sign the peace agreement.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=650}} As Kissinger returned to Washington, one of his aides recalled \"In twenty-four hours, the bottom fell out\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=648}}\n\nThrough Nixon had initially supported Kissinger against Thi\u1ec7u, but two of his most influential advisers, namely his Chief of Staff, [[H.R. Haldeman]] and the Domestic Affairs Adviser [[John Ehrlichman]] urged him to reconsider, arguing that Kissinger had given away too much and Thi\u1ec7u's objections had merit.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} As Thi\u1ec7u sensed Nixon's changing mood, on 24 October 1972 he called a press conference to denounce the draft agreement as a betrayal and stated the Viet Cong \"must be wiped out quickly and mercilessly\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} On October 26, North Vietnam published the draft agreement and accused the United States of tying to \"sabotage\" it by backing Thi\u1ec7u.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} On the same day, Kissinger who until then had never spoken to the media called a press conference at the White House to say: \"We believe peace is at hand. We believe an agreement is within sight\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} Kissinger later admitted that this statement was a major mistake as it inflated hopes for peace while enraging Nixon who saw it as weakness.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} Nixon came very close to disavowed Kissinger as he declared the draft peace agreement had \"differences that must be resolved\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} Taking up Thi\u1ec7u's cause as his own, Nixon wanted 69 amendments to the draft peace agreement included in the final treaty and ordered Kissinger back to Paris to force Tho to accept them.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} Kissinger regarded Nixons' 69 amendments as \"preposterous\" as he knew Tho would never accept them.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} By this point, Kissinger's relations with Nixon were tense while Nixon's \"German shepherds\" Haldeman and Ehrlichman intrigued against him.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}}\n\nAs expected, Tho refused to consider any of the 69 amendments and on 13 December 1972 left Paris for Hanoi after he accused the Americans of negotiating in bad faith.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=652}} Kissinger by this stage was worked up into a state of fury after Tho walked out of the Paris talks and told Nixon: \"They're just a bunch of shits.

Sadat's liked to say that his favorite game was backgammon, a game where skill and persistence was rewarded, but was best won by sudden gambles, making an analogy between how he played backgammon and conducted his diplomacy.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=393}} Under Nasser, Egypt and Saudi Arabia had engaged what was known as the [[Arab Cold War]], but Sadat got along very well with King [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia]], forming an alliance between the most populous Arab state and the most wealthiest Arab state. Kissinger later admitted that he was engrossed with the Paris peace talks to end Vietnam war that he and others in Washington missed the significance of the Egyptian-Saudi alliance. At the same that Sadat moved closer to Saudi Arabia, he also wanted a rapprochement with the United States and to move Egypt away from its alliance with the Soviet Union. In July 1972, Sadat expelled all 16, 000 of the Soviet military personnel in Egypt in a signal that he wanted better relations with the United States. Kissinger was taken completely by surprise by Sadat's move, saying: \"Why has he done me this favor? Why didn't he demand all sorts of concessions first?\"{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=393}}\n\nSadat expected as a reward that the United States would respond by pressuring Israel to return the Sinai to Egypt, but after his anti-Soviet move prompted no response from the United States, by November 1972 Sadat moved again closer to the Soviet Union, buying a massive amount of Soviet arms for a war he planned to launch against Israel in 1973. For Sadat, cost was no object as the money to buy Soviet arms came from Saudi Arabia.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=393\u2013394}} At the same time, Faisal promised Sadat that if it should come to war, Saudi Arabia would embargo oil to the West. In April 1973, the Saudi Oil Minister [[Ahmed Zaki Yamani]] visited Washington to meet Kissinger and told him that King Faisal was becoming more and more unhappy with the United States, saying he wanted America to pressure Israel to return all the lands captured in the Six Day War of 1967.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=398\u2013399}} In a later interview, Yamani accused Kissinger of not taking his warning seriously, saying all he did was to ask him not to speak anymore of this threat.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=399}} Angry at Kissinger, Yamani in an interview with the ''Washington Post'' on 19 April 1973 warned that King Faisal was considering an oil embargo.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=399}} At the time, the general feeling in Washington was the Saudis were bluffing and nothing would come of their threat to impose an oil embargo.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=400\u2013401}}&nbsp;The fact that Faisal's ineffectual half brother King Saud had imposed a cripplingly oil embargo on Britain and France during the Suez War of 1956 was not considered an important precedent.

Likewise, Kissinger regarded Meir as being rather arrogant and believed that an armistice that ended the war in a manner that was not an unambiguous Israeli victory would make her more humble.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=408}} As both Syria and Egypt lost much equipment during the fighting, the Soviet Union began to fly new equipment in starting on 12 October, and the Soviet flights to Syria and Egypt were recorded by the British radar stations in Cyprus.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=408}} Through the Soviets were flying in an average of 60 flights per day, exaggerated accounts appeared in Western newspapers speaking of \"one hundred flights per day\".{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=408\u2013409}} At this point, both Nixon and Kissinger began to see the October War more in terms of the Cold War rather than Middle Eastern politics, both seeing the Soviet arms lifts to Egypt and Syria as a Soviet power play that required an American answer.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=408\u2013409}}\n\nIsrael took heavy losses in men and material during the fighting against Egypt and Syria, and on 18 October 1973 Meir requested $850 million worth of American arms and equipment to replace its material losses.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=409\u2013410}} Nixon decided characteristically to act on an epic scale and instead of the $850 million worth of arms requested sent some $2 billion worth of arms to Israel as he boasted that the U.S. Air Force flew more sorties to Israel in October 1973 than it had during the Berlin Airlift of 1948\u201349.<ref>Arnon Gutfeld  and Boaz Vanetik. \"\u2018A Situation That Had to Be Manipulated\u2019: The American Airlift to Israel During the Yom Kippur War.\" ''Middle Eastern Studies'' 52.3 (2016): 419-447.</ref>  In an interview with the British historian [[Robert Lacey]] in 1981, Kissinger later admitted about the arms lift to Israel: \"I made a mistake.

The years from 1945 to 1973 had been a period of unprecedented prosperity in the West, a \"long summer\" that many believed would never end, and its abrupt end in 1973 as the oil embargo which increased the price of oil by 400% within a matter of days threw the world's economy into a sharp recession with unemployment mounting and inflation raging came as a profound shock.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=414\u2013416}} The end of what the French called the ''Trente Glorieuses'' (\"Glorious Thirty\") led to a mood of widespread pessimism in the West with the ''Financial Times'' running a famous headline in late 1973 saying \"The Future will be subject to Delay\".{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=416\u2013417}}\n\nIn the midst of the war, in what journalist Elizabeth Drew called \u201cStrangelove Day,\u201d Kissinger put U.S. military forces on [[DEFCON]] 3 late in the evening of October 24, in what a historian argues is \"best understood as an emotional response to a misunderstanding\" with Soviet ambassador to the United States [[Anatoly Dobrynin]].<ref name=\"Barbara Keys 2011\"/>\n\nIsrael regained the territory it lost in the early fighting and gained new territories from Syria and Egypt, including land in Syria east of the previously captured [[Golan Heights]], and additionally on the western bank of the [[Suez Canal]], although they did lose some territory on the eastern side of the Suez Canal that had been in Israeli hands since the end of the [[Six-Day War]]. During a summit in Cairo on 6 November, Kissinger asked Sadat what Faisal was like and was told: \"Well, Dr. Henry, he will probably go on with you about Communism and the Jews\".{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=417}} King Faisal's two great hatreds were Communism and Zionism as he believed that the Soviet Union and Israel were plotting together against Islam.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=385\u2013386}} When King Faisal was shown a translation into Arabic of ''The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion'', he instantly believed in the authenticity of ''The Protocols'' and therefore talked to anyone who would listen about what he had learned, despite the fact that ''The Protocols'' had been exposed as a forgery in 1921.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=385\u2013386}} On 7 November 1973, Kissinger flew to Riyadh to meet King Faisal and ask him to end the oil embargo in exchange for promising to be \"evenhanded\" with the Arab-Israeli dispute.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=417}} As the plane carrying him prepared to land in Riyadh, Kissinger was clearly nervous at the prospect of negotiating with the stern Wahhabi Faisal who had a marked dislike of Jews.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=417}} Kissinger discovered that King Faisal was a worthy companion to [[L\u00ea \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1ecd]] in terms of stubbornness as the king accused the United States of being biased in favor of Israel, instead engaging in a long rant about the balefulness of \"Jewish Communists\" in Russia and Israel, and despite all of Kissinger's efforts to charm him, refused to end the oil embargo.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=418\u2013419}} In February 1974, King Faisal chaired the second summit of Islamic states (which unlike the first summit Faisal had chaired in 1969 was not boycotted by Iraq and Syria), where he was acclaimed as a conquering hero who humiliated and humbled the West by wrecking its economy, and henceforward Kissinger had to face a bloc of Muslim states who were far more assertive and self-confident than before.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=419\u2013420}}\n\nOnly on 19 March 1974 did the king end the oil embargo after Sadat, whom he trusted, reported to him that the United States was being more \"evenhanded\" and after Kissinger had promised to sell Saudi Arabia weapons that it had previously denied under the grounds that they might be used against Israel.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=420\u2013421}} More importantly, Saudi Arabia had billions of dollars invested in Western banks, and the massive bout of inflation set off by the oil embargo was a threat to this fortune as inflation eroded the value of the money, giving Faisal a vested interest in helping to contain the damage he himself inflicted on the economies of the West.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=421}}\n\nKissinger pressured the Israelis to [[cede]] some of the newly captured land back to its Arab neighbors, contributing to the first phases of Israeli\u2013Egyptian non-aggression. In 1973\u201374, Kissinger engaged in \"shuttle diplomacy\" flying between Tel Avi, Cairo and Damascus in a bid to make the armistice the basis of a preferment peace.

He might then allow himself to be driven back to the attainable, fighting a dogged rear guard action that made clear that concessions could be exacted only at a heavy price and that discouraged excessive expectations of them.

The move saw a warming in [[Foreign relations of Egypt#United States|U.S.\u2013Egyptian relations]], bitter since the 1950s, as the country moved away from its former independent stance and into a close partnership with the United States. The peace was finalized in 1978 when U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] mediated the [[Camp David Accords (1978)|Camp David Accords]], during which Israel returned the [[Sinai Peninsula]] in exchange for an Egyptian peace agreement that included the recognition of the state of Israel.\n\n===The Persian Gulf===\nA major concern for Kissinger was the possibility of Soviet influence in the oil-rich region of the Persian Gulf. Iraq had been ruled by the Baath Party since 1968, and in April 1969 came into conflict with Iran when Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] renounced the 1937 treaty governing the Shatt-al-Arab river. After two years of skirmishes along the border, President [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]] broke off diplomatic relations with Iran on 1 December 1971.{{sfnp|Zonis|1991|p=69}} On 9 April 1972, Iraq signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union.{{sfnp|Zonis|1991|p=69}} In May 1972, Nixon and Kissinger visited Tehran to tell the Shah that there would be no \"second-guessing of his requests\" to buy American weapons.{{sfnp|Zonis|1991|p=69}} At the same time, Nixon and Kissinger agreed a plan of the Shah's that the United States together with Iran and Israel would support the Kurdish ''peshmerga'' guerrillas fighting for independence from Iraq.{{sfnp|Zonis|1991|p=69}} Kissinger later wrote that after Vietnam, there was no possibility of deploying American forces in the Middle East, and henceforward Iran was to act as America's surrogate in the Persian Gulf.{{sfnp|Zonis|1991|p=201}} Kissinger described the Baathist regime in Iraq as a potential threat to the United States and believed that building up Iran and supporting the ''peshmerga'' was the best counterweight.{{sfnp|Zonis|1991|p=201}}\n\nKissinger wrote about the last Shah: \"[he] had been restored to the throne in 1953 by American influence when a leftist government had come close to toppling him. He never forgot that; it may have been the root of his extraordinary trust in American purposes and American goodwill, and of his psychological disintegration when he sensed that friendship evaporating. On some levels excessively, even morbidly, suspicious of possible attempts to diminish his authority, he nevertheless retained an almost naive faith in the United States\".{{sfnp|Zonis|1991|p=166}} An essentially weak man, the Shah's ego was greatly inflated when Nixon and Kissinger told him that he was to be America's \"man in the Persian Gulf\", and he began to display signs of the megalomania that characterized his reign until his overthrow in the Iranian Revolution.{{sfnp|Zonis|1991|p=210}} A childlike man whose upbringing was warped by his overbearing and violent father, Reza Khan, the last Shah had a pathological and desperate need for American approval that closely resembled the way he needed his father's approval which he never received.{{sfnp|Zonis|1991|pp=210\u2013211}} Once Mohammad Reza felt he finally had the approval of the United States, his ego became inflated, leading to his belief that he was always right because America approved of him.{{sfnp|Zonis|1991|p=210}}\n\nTo put further pressure on Iraq, in the winter of 1974\u201375, the ''peshmerga'' were encouraged by Iran and the United States to switch from guerrilla warfare to conventional war, marking the sharpest point in the fighting.<ref name=Brogan>{{cite book|last=Brogan|first=Patrick|title=World Conflicts|publisher=Bloomsburgy|year=1989|p=298|isbn=0810835517}}</ref>  In March 1975, Mohammad Reza signed the Algiers Accord with Vice President [[Saddam Hussein]] of Iraq which settled the dispute over the Shatt-al-Arab river to Iran's satisfaction, and at which point Iran, Israel and the United States abandoned the ''peshmerga'' to their fate, cutting off the arms supplies.{{sfnp|Zonis|1991|p=70}} The sudden ending of support caused the overexposed ''peshmerga'' to be rapidly defeated and as the British journalist Patrick Brogan noted that \"...the Iraqis celebrated their victory in the usual manner, by executing as many of the rebels as they could lay their hands on\".<ref name=Brogan/> At the time, Kissinger stated: \"Fuck the Kurds if they can\u2019t take a joke\" and \u201ccovert action should not be confused with missionary work.\u201d<ref>{{cite news |last1=Riede |first1=Bruce |title=Masoud Barzani and the roots of Kurdish distrust of the United States |url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2017/11/02/masoud-barzani-and-the-roots-of-kurdish-distrust-of-the-united-states/ |accessdate=13 January 2020 |publisher=Brookings Institution |date=2 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Turkish invasion of Cyprus===\n{{See also|Turkish invasion of Cyprus}}\nFollowing a period of steady relations between the U.S. Government and the [[Greek junta|Greek military regime]] after 1967, Secretary of State Kissinger was faced with the coup by the Greek junta and the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in July and August 1974.

By promising to continue the peace talks which Johnson began in May 1968 in Paris Nixon admitted that he had ruled out \"a military victory\" in Vietnam..{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=582}} Nixon wanted a diplomatic settlement similar to the armistice of Panmunjom that ended the Korean War and frequently stated in private he had no intention of being \"the first president of the United States to lose a war\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=582}} To force the North Vietnamese to sign an armistice, Nixon favored a two-pronged approach of the \"madman theory\" of seeking to act rashly to intimate the North Vietnamese while at the same time trying using the strategy of \"linkage\" to improve relations with the Soviet Union and China in order to persuade both these nations to stop sending arms to North Vietnam..{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=582\u2013583}}  In office, and assisted by Kissinger, Nixon implemented a policy of [[Vietnamization]] that aimed to gradually withdraw U.S. troops while expanding the combat role of the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|South Vietnamese Army]] so that it would be capable of independently defending its government against the [[Viet Cong|National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam]], a Communist guerrilla organization, and the North Vietnamese army ([[Vietnam People's Army]] or PAVN).\n\nIn an article published in ''Foreign Affairs'' in January 1969, Kissinger criticized General William Westmoreland's attrition strategy because the Vietnamese Communists were willing to accept far higher losses on the battlefield than the United States and could therefore \"win\" as long as they did not \"lose\" by merely keeping the war going.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=588}} In the same article, he argued that losses endured by the Vietnamese Communists in the Tet Offensive were meaningless as the Tet Offensive had turned American public opinion against the war, ruling out the possibility of a military solution, and the best that could be done now was to negotiate the most favorable peace settlement at the Paris peace talks.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=587}} Kissinger, when he came into office in 1969 favored a negotiating strategy under which the United States and North Vietnam would sign an armistice and agreed to pull their troops out of South Vietnam while the South Vietnamese government and the Viet Cong were to agree to a coalition government.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=588}} Kissinger had doubts about Nixon's theory of \"linkage\", believing that this would give the Soviet Union leverage over the United States and unlike Nixon was less concerned about the ultimate fate of South Vietnam.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=588\u2013589}} One of Kissinger's first acts as National Security Adviser in early 1969 was to seek opinions of the Vietnam experts within the CIA, the military and the State Department.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=589}} The lengthy volume that emerged contained a diverse collection of opinions with some stating the South Vietnamese were making \"rapid strides\" while others doubted that the government in Saigon would \"ever constitute an effective political or military counter to the Vietcong\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=589}} The \"bulls\" estimated that American troops would need to fight on in Vietnam for 8.3 years before the South Vietnamese would be able to fight on their own while the \"bears\" estimated it take 13.4 years of American troops fighting in Vietnam before the South Vietnamese would be able to fight on their own.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=589}} Kissinger passed the volume on to Nixon with the comment that there was no consensus within the expert community with the implied conclusion that he should be free on his own without consulting the experts.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=589}}\n\nIn early 1969, Kissinger was opposed to the plans for [[Operation Menu]], the bombing of Cambodia, fearing that Nixon was acting rashly with no plans for the diplomatic fall-out, but on 16 March 1969 Nixon at a meeting at the White House attended by Kissinger announced the bombing would start the next day.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=591}} As Congress was unlikely to grant approval to bombing Cambodia, Nixon decided to go ahead without Congressional approval and keep the bombings secret, a decision that several constitutional law experts argued was illegal.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=592}} In May 1969, the bombing was leaked to [[William M. Beecher]] of the ''New York Times'' who published an article about it, which infuriated Kissinger.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=592}} At the time, Kissinger told the FBI director J.E. Hoover \"we will destroy whoever did this\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=592}} As a result, the phones of 13 members of Kissinger's staff were taped by the FBI without a warrant.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=592}} At the time, Kissinger portrayed himself to his friends at Harvard as a moderating force who was working to remove the United States from Vietnam, saying he did not want to end up like his predecessor W.W. Rostow, whose actions as National Security Adviser had caused him to be ostracized by the liberal American intelligentsia.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}}\n\nAs part of the \"linkage\" concept, Kissinger in March 1969 sent [[Cyrus Vance]] to Moscow with the message that if the Soviet Union pressured North Vietnam into a diplomatic settlement favorable to the United States, the reward would be concessions on the talks on limiting the nuclear arms race.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=592\u2013593}} At the same time, Kissinger met with the Soviet ambassador [[Anatoly Dobrynin]] to warn him that Nixon was a dangerous man who wanted to escalate the Vietnam war.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=593}} Nixon and Kissinger played a \"good cop-bad cop\" routine with Dobrynin with Nixon acting the part of the petulant president at the end of his patience with North Vietnam while Kissinger acted as the reasonable diplomat anxious to improve relations with the Soviet Union, saying to Dobrynin in May 1969 that Nixon would \"escalate the war\" if the Soviet Union \"didn't produce a settlement\" in Vietnam.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=595}} At another meeting in 1969, Kissinger warned Dobrynin that \"the train has just left the station and is now headed down the track\", saying the Soviet Union better start pressuring North Vietnam now before Nixon did something truly reckless and dangerous.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=593}} The attempt at \"linkage\" failed as the Soviet Union did not pressure North Vietnam and instead Dobrynin told Kissinger that the Soviets wanted better relations with the United States regardless of the Vietnam war.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=593}} After the failure of the \"linkage\" attempt, Nixon became more open to the alternative strategy suggested by the Defense Secretary [[Melvin Laird]] who argued that the burden of the war should be shifted to the South Vietnamese, which was initially called \"de-Americanization\" and which Laird renamed Vietnamization because it sounded better.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=594}}\n\nOn 4 August 1969, Kissinger met secretly with [[Xu\u00e2n Th\u1ee7y]] at the Paris apartment of [[Jean Sainteny]] to discuss peace.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=597}} Kissinger repeated the American offer of \"mutual withdrawal\" of U.S and North Vietnamese forces from South Vietnam which Th\u1ee7y rejected while Th\u1ee7y demanded a new government in Saigon which Kissinger rejected.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=597}} &nbsp;Kissinger had a low opinion of North Vietnam, saying \"I can't believe that a fourth-rate power like North Vietnam doesn't have a breaking point\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}} Kissinger was opposed to the strategy of Vietnamization, expressing some doubt about the ability of the ARVN (Army of the Republic of Vietnam-i.e. the South Vietnamese Army) to hold the field, causing much tension with Defense Secretary Laird who was deeply committed to Vietnamization.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}}  In September 1969, Kissinger in a memo advised Nixon against \"de-escalation\", saying that keeping U.S troops fighting in Vietnam \"remains one of our few bargaining weapons\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}} In the same memo, Kissinger stated he was \"deeply disturbed\" that Nixon had started pulling out U.S. troops, saying that withdrawing the troops was like \"salted peanuts\" to the American people, \"the more U.S troops come home, the more will be demanded\", giving the advantage to the enemy who merely had to \"wait us out\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}} Instead, he recommenced that the United States resume bombing North Vietnam and mine the coast.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}} Later in September 1969, Kissinger proposed a plan for what he called a \"savage, punishing\" blow against North Vietnam code-named [[Duck Hook]] to Nixon, arguing that this was the best way to force North Vietnam to agree to peace on American terms.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}} Laird was strongly opposed to Duck Hook, warning Nixon that the use of nuclear weapons to kill a massive number of North Vietnamese civilians would alienate American public opinion from the administration and persuaded Nixon to reject it.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}} Reflecting his background as a Harvard professor of political science who belonged to the ''Primat der Aussenpolitik'' school which saw foreign policy as belonging only to a small elite, Kissinger was less sensitive to public opinion than Laird, a former Republican congressman who constantly advised Nixon to keep American public opinion in mind.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}}\n\nKissinger played a key role in [[Operation Menu|bombing Cambodia]] to disrupt PAVN and Viet Cong units launching raids into South Vietnam from within Cambodia's borders and resupplying their forces by using the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]] and other routes, as well as the 1970 [[Cambodian Incursion]] and subsequent widespread bombing of [[Khmer Rouge]] targets in Cambodia. The Paris peace talks had become stalemated by late 1969 owing to the obstructionism of the South Vietnamese delegation who wanted the talks to fail.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=624}} The South Vietnamese President [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u]] did not want the United States to withdraw from Vietnam, and out of frustration with him, Kissinger decided to begin secret peace talks in Paris parallel to the official talks that the South Vietnamese were unaware of.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=623}} On 21 February 1970, Kissinger secretly met in a modest house in a Paris suburb [[L\u00ea \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1ecd]], the North Vietnamese diplomat who was to become his most tenacious adversary.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=623}} In 1981, Kissinger told the journalist [[Stanley Karnow]]: \"I don't look back on our meetings with any great joy, yet he was a person of substance and discipline who defended the position he represented with dedication\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=623}} Not until February 1971 were Rogers and Laird first informed of the parallel peace talks in Paris.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=623}} Kissinger was to meet Tho three times between February-April 1970, and the North Vietnamese first sensed a softening of the American position during these talks as Kissinger slightly altered the \"mutual withdrawal formula\" that the Americans had previously held to.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=625}}&nbsp;Nixon was gravely disappointed that the secret talks in Paris did not have the prompt results he wanted.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=607}} Kissinger wrote in his memoirs that \"historians rarely do justice to the psychological stress on a policy-maker\", noting that by early 1970 Nixon was feeling very much besieged and inclined to lash out against a world he was believed was plotting his downfall.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=606}} Nixon had become obsessed with the film ''Patton'', seeing how the film presented Patton as a solitary and misunderstood genius whom the world did not appreciate a parallel to himself and kept watching the film over and over again.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=607}}\n\nOn 18 March 1970, the Prime Minister of Cambodia, [[Lon Nol]] carried out a coup against King Sihanouk and ultimately declared Cambodia a republic.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=604\u2013605}} Out of fury with Lon Nol, the king went to Beijing where he allied himself to his former enemies, the Khmer Rouge, calling upon the Khmer people to \"liberate our motherland\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=606}} As the most of the Khmer peasantry regarded the king as a god-like figure, the royal endorsement of the Khmer Rouge had immediate results. Cambodia had descended into chaos by late March 1970 as Lon Nol regime to prove its nationalist credibility organized pogroms against the Vietnamese minority, leading the North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong to attack and defeat Cambodia's weak army.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=606}} Nixon believed in the situation in Cambodia offered the chance for him to be like Patton by doing something bold and risky.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=606\u2013607}} Kissinger was initially ambivalent about Nixon's plans to invade Cambodia, but as he saw the president was committed, he became more and more supportive.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=608}} On 23 April 1970, Nixon in a memo to Kissinger declared \"we need a bold move in Cambodia to show that we stand with Lon Nol\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=608}}\n\nOn 26 April 1970, Nixon decided to \"go for broke\" by invading Cambodia with U.S troops.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=608}} When Nixon's speech-writer [[William Safire]] pointed out that the use of U.S. troops violated the Nixon Doctrine that America's Asian allies should do the fighting, Kissinger snapped at him: \"We wrote the goddamn doctrine, we can change it!\"{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=609}} Kissinger was under immense strain as several of his aides were planning to resign to protest the invasion of Cambodia, his liberal friends from Harvard were pressuring him to resign as well while Nixon was all for more belligerence.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=609}} Kissinger received a phone call from Nixon and his best friend, [[Bebe Rebozo|Charles \"Bebe\" Rebozo]], who both sounded very drunk; Nixon began the call and then handed the phone to Rebozo who said: \"The President wants you to know if this doesn't work, Henry, it's your ass\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=609}} On 30 April 1970, the United States invaded Cambodia which Nixon announced in a television address that Kissinger contemptuously called \"vintage Nixon\" because of his overblown rhetoric.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=609}} At the time, Nixon was seen as recklessly escalating the war and in early May 1970 the largest protests ever against the Vietnam war took place.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=611}} Four of Kissinger's aides resigned in protest while the Cambodian \"incursion\" ended several of Kissinger's friendships with colleagues from Harvard when he chose not to resign.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=611}} Nixon in his memoirs claimed that Kissinger \"took a particularly hard line\" with regards to the \"Cambodian incursion\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=611}} Roger Morris, one of Kissinger's aides later recalled that he was frightened by the huge anti-war demonstrations, comparing the antiwar movement to Nazis.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=611}} Kissinger was haunted by memories of his youth in Germany, and had a deep distrust of mass movements of either the left or the right, favoring the Primat der Aussenpolitik school of foreign-policy making by an elite with the masses excluded. In his interview with Karnow, Kissinger maintained he felt torn about where he stood and blamed Nixon for his failure to find \"the language of respect and compassion that might have created a bridge at least to the more reasonable elements of the antiwar movement\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=611}}\n\nThe Cambodian \"incursion\" saw American and South Vietnamese take the areas of eastern Cambodia that American commanders called the Fish Hook and Parrot's Beak and captured an impressive haul of arms originating from China and the Soviet Union.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=609\u2013610}} But the majority of Vietnamese Communist forces had withdrawn deeper into Cambodia before the invasion with only a small number left behind to wage a fighting retreat to avoid charges of cowardice.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=609\u2013610}} In June 1970, the Americans pulled out of Cambodia and the Vietnamese Communists returned, through the loss of weapons greatly hindered their operations in the Saigon area for the rest of 1970.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=610 & 625}} Having committed itself to supporting Lon Nol, the United States now had two allies instead of one to support in Southeast Asia.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=612}}\n\nThe bombing campaign in Cambodia contributed to the chaos of the [[Cambodian Civil War]], which saw the forces of leader [[Lon Nol]] unable to retain foreign support to combat the growing Khmer Rouge insurgency that would overthrow him in 1975.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Totten |first1=Samuel |last2=Parsons |first2=William S. |last3=Charny |first3=Israel W. |title=Century of Genocide: Critical Essays and Eyewitness Accounts |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2004 |page=349 |isbn=978-0-415-94430-4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5Ef8Hrx8Cd0C&pg=PA349 |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Smyth |first1=Marie |last2=Robinson |first2=Gillian |title=Researching Violently Divided Societies: Ethical and Methodological Issues |publisher=[[United Nations University Press]] |year=2001 |page=93 |isbn=978-92-808-1065-3 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZWqNwsv6AIQC&pg=PA93 |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}</ref> Documents uncovered from the Soviet archives after 1991 reveal that the North Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1970 was launched at the explicit request of the Khmer Rouge and negotiated by [[Pol Pot]]'s then second in command, [[Nuon Chea]].<ref>Dmitry Mosyakov, \"The Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese Communists: A History of Their Relations as Told in the Soviet Archives\", in Susan E.

The ARVN invaded Laos on 8 February 1971 and were stopped decisively by the North Vietnamese.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=629\u2013630}} In March, Kissinger sent his deputy Haig to inspect the situation personally, leading him to report that the ARVN officers lacked courage and did not want to fight, making retreat the only option.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=630}}&nbsp;The retreat when it began turned into a rout.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=630}} Kissinger wrote Lam Son had fallen \"far short of our expectations\", which he blamed on bad American planning, poor South Vietnamese tactics and Nixon's leadership style, leading Karnow to write he blamed \"everyone, characteristically, except himself\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=631}}\n\nIn late May 1971, Kissinger returned to Paris to fruitlessly meet again with Tho.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} The North Vietnamese demand that Thi\u1ec7u step down proved to the main obstacle.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} Kissinger did not want a repeat of the prolonged bout of political instability that characterized South Vietnam from 1963 to 1967 and believed Thi\u1ec7u was a force for order.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} Tho suggested to Kissinger that Americans \"stop supporting\"  Thi\u1ec7u who was running for the reelection in a ballot scheduled for 3 October 1971.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} Tho claimed that Thi\u1ec7u's opponents, Air Marshal [[Nguy\u1ec5n Cao K\u1ef3]] and General [[D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh]] aka \"Big Minh\", were both open to a coalition government with the Viet Cong and had if either men were elected president, the war would be over by late 1971.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} Thi\u1ec7u used a legal technicality to disqualify K\u1ef3 while Minh dropped out when it was clear the election was rigged.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} In the 1971 election, the CIA donated money for Thi\u1ec7u's reelection campaign while the Americans did not pressure Thi\u1ec7u to stop rigging the election.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}} Through Kissinger did not regard South Vietnam as important in its own right, he believed it was necessary to support South Vietnam to maintain the United States as a global power, believing that none of America's allies would trust the United States if South Vietnam were abandoned too quickly.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} Kissinger also believed that if South Vietnam were to collapse, it \"leave deep scars on our society, feeling impulses for recrimination\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} As a Jew who had grown up in Nazi Germany, Kissinger was haunted by how the ''Dolchsto\u00dflegende'' had used by the German right to delegitimatize the Weimar Republic, and believed that something similar would happen in the United States should it lose the Vietnam War, fueling the rise of right-wing extremism.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}}\n\nIn June 1971, Kissinger supported Nixon's effort to ban the [[Pentagon Papers]] saying the \"hemorrhage of state secrets\" to the media was making diplomacy impossible.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=633}} [[Daniel Ellsberg]], the man who leaked the Pentagon Papers to the ''New York Times'' had been consulted by Kissinger for ideas about Vietnam in late 1968-early 1969, but when he leaked the papers, Kissinger told Nixon that he was a left-wing \"fanatic\" and a \"drug abuser\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=633}} Kissinger depicted Ellsberg to Nixon as a drug-crazed degenerate of questionable mental stability out to ruin his administration. Reflecting his increasingly frustration with the war, Nixon often talked to Kissinger in a bloodthirsty manner about a \"fantasy holocaust\" in which he would have U.S. forces kill every living thing in North Vietnam and then pull out, leading the latter appalled by his own account.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}}\n\nBy early 1972, Nixon boosted that he had pulled out 400, 000 U.S soldiers from Vietnam since July 1969, and battle deaths had fallen from an average of 200 per week in 1969 down to an average of 10 per week in 1972.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}} The policy of Vietnamization had, as Laird predicted it would, tamed the antiwar movement as most Americans objected not to war in Vietnam per se, only to Americans dying in it.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}} With the antiwar movement in decline by 1972, Nixon believed his chances of reelection were good, but Kissinger kept complaining that he was losing \"negotiating assets\" in his talks with Tho every time a withdrawal of American forces was announced.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}}  Likewise, Kissinger noted that the major reason why Congress despite the antiwar feelings of many of its members kept voting to fund the war was because the argument it was patriotic to support \"our boys in the field\"; as more Americans were pulled out, Congress was less inclined to vote to fund keeping South Vietnamese \"boys in the field\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}} However, the imperatives of being re-elected was far more important to Nixon than with giving Kissinger \"negotiating assets\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}} In early 1972, Nixon publicly revealed that Kissinger had secretly negotiating with Tho since 1970 to prove that he was really was committed to peace in Vietnam despite what the antiwar movement had been saying about him for the last three years.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}} Reflecting Kissinger's weakening hand in his talks with Tho, Nixon had increasingly come by 1971\u201372 to believe that \"linkage\" concept of improving relations with the Soviet Union and China in exchange for those nations cutting off the supply of weapons to North Vietnam offered his best chance of a favorable peace deal.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}}\n\nOn 21 February 1972 was in Nixon's words \"the week that changed the world\" as he landed in Beijing to meet [[Mao Zedong]].{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=638}} Kissinger who accompanied Nixon to China spent much time talking to the suave Chinese Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] about Vietnam, pressing him to end the supply of arms to North Vietnam.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=638}} The talks went nowhere as Zhou told Kissinger that the North Vietnamese played off China against the Soviet Union, and to cut off North Vietnam would allow it to fall into the Soviet sphere of influence.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=638}} As the Chinese People's Liberation Army had badly bloodied by the Red Army in a border war in 1969, Zhou stated that to face a two-front war with Chinese forces facing North Vietnam in the south and the Soviet Union in the north was not acceptable to his government.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=638}} Zhou offered Kissinger only the vague message that China supported efforts to find peace in Vietnam while refusing to make any promises, though Kissinger also noted that Zhou declined to endorse North Vietnam's demands.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=638}} Despite Nixon's coming visit, in late 1971 the Chinese drastically increased their military aid to North Vietnam and continued to send a massive amount of weapons south even as Nixon and Kissinger exchanged pleasantries with Mao and Zhou in Beijing.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=639}}&nbsp;As usual, when the Chinese increased their supply of arms to North Vietnam, the Soviet Union did likewise as both Communist states competed with one another for influence in Hanoi by tying to be the biggest supplier of weapons.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=639}} On 30 March 1972, the PAVN launched the [[Easter Offensive]] that overran several provinces in South Vietnam while pushing the ARVN to the brink of collapse.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=640\u2013642}}\n\nAt the time of the Easter Offensive, Kissinger was deeply involved in planning for Nixon's visit to Moscow in May 1972. The offensive brought to the fore the differences between Nixon and Kissinger. Nixon threatened to cancel his summit with [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in Moscow if the Soviet Union did not force North Vietnam to end the Easter Offensive at once, saying: \"Whatever else happens, we cannot lose this war. The summit isn't worth a damn if the price for it is losing in Vietnam\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=644}} Nixon in his instructions to Kissinger stated that he viewed the relations with the Soviet Union through the prism of the Vietnam war and if the Soviets were not prepared to help, Kissinger \"should just pack up and come home\"..{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=644}} Kissinger for his part believed that Nixon was massively exaggerating Soviet influence in North Vietnam and not longer believed if he ever did in Nixon's \"linkage\" concept.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=644}} Kissinger feared that Nixon was obsessed with Vietnam and damaging relations with the Soviet Union over Vietnam would destabilize the international power balance by increasing American-Soviet tensions.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=644}} On 20 April 1972, Kissinger arrived in Moscow without informing the U.S. ambassador [[Jacob D. Beam]], and then went to have tea with Brezhnev in the Kremlin.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=644}} Nixon as usual when under stress departed for a marathon drinking session with Rebozo at Camp David, and via Haig kept sending messages to Kissinger to be tough with Brezhnev.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=644}} As no American president had ever visited Moscow before, Kissinger got the impression that Brezhnev wanted the planned summit to happen \"at almost any cost\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=644}} Kissinger's implemented Nixon's emphasis on building an amicable personal relationship with Brezhnev.<ref>Barbara Keys,  \"Nixon/Kissinger and Brezhnev.\" ''Diplomatic History'' 42.4 (2018): 548-551.</ref>  Upon his return to Washington, Kissinger reported that Brezhnev would not cancel the summit and was keen to sign the SALT I Treaty.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} Kissinger went to Paris on 3 May to meet Tho with orders from Nixon that North Vietnam must \"Settle or else!\"{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} Nixon complained that Kissinger was \"obsessed\" with the need for a peace treaty while he charged that he now wished he followed his instincts to bomb North Vietnam in 1970, saying if he had done so, the war would have been over by now.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} On 2 May 1972, the PAVN had captured Quangtri, an important provincial city in South Vietnam, and as a result of this victory, Tho was in no mood for a compromise.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} Through Kissinger in general shared Nixon's determination to be tough, he was afraid that the president would overreact and destroy the budding d\u00e9tente with the Soviet Union and China by striking too hard at North Vietnam.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} Moreover, after the rupture caused by the Cambodian incursion, Kissigner was trying hard to rebuilt his relations with the liberal American intelligentsia, saying he did want to become \"this administration's Walt Rostow\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} Kissinger's predecessor, Rostow had once being a professor at Harvard, Oxford the MIT, and Cambridge, but serving as the National Security Adviser had shunned by the Ivy League universities and ended up at the lowly University of Texas, a fate that Kissinger was determined to avoid.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} On 5 May 1972, Nixon ordered the U.S. Air Force to start bombing Hanoi and Haiphong and on 8 May ordered the U.S Navy to mine the coast of North Vietnam.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} As the bombings and mining of North Vietnam, Nixon and even more so Kissinger waited anxiously for the Soviet reaction, and much to their relief received only the standard statement decrying the American action and a diplomatic note complaining that American aircraft had bombed a Soviet freighter in Haiphong harbor.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=646}} The Moscow summit was not canceled.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=646}}\n\nOn 24 July 1972, Congress passed an act calling for the total withdraw of all American forces from Vietnam once all of the American POWs in North Vietnam were released, causing Kissinger to say the North Vietnamese only had to wait until \"Congress voted us of the war\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=646}} However, the sight of Nixon and Kissinger posing for photographs with Brezhnev and Mao deeply worried the North Vietnamese who were afraid of being \"sold out\" by either China and/or the Soviet Union, causing some flexibility in their negotiating tactics.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=646}} The Eastern Offensive had not caused the collapse of the South Vietnamese government, but it increased the amount of territory under Communist control.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=647}} The North Vietnamese were moving towards taking up the \"standstill ceasefire\" offer and ordered the Viet Cong to seize as much territory as possible in preparation for a \"leopard's spot\" ceasefire (so called because the patchwork of territories controlled by the Viet Cong and the Saigon government resembled the spots on a leopard's fur).{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=647}} On 1 August 1972, Kissinger met Tho again in Paris, and for first time, he seemed willing to compromise, saying that political and military terms of an armistice could be treated separately and hinted that his government was no longer willing to make the overthrow of Thi\u1ec7u a precondition.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=647}}\n\nOn the evening of 8 October 1972 at a secret meeting of Kissinger and Tho in a house in the Paris suburb of Gif-sur-Yvette once owned by the painter Fernard L\u00e9ger&nbsp;came the decisive breakthrough in the talks.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=647\u2013648}} Tho believed that Kissinger was as he later it put \"in a rush\"&nbsp;for a peace deal before the presidential election, and began with he called \"a very realistic and very simple proposal\" for a ceasefire that would see the Americans pull all their forces out of Vietnam in exchange for the release of all the POWs in North Vietnam.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=648}} As for the ultimate fate of South Vietnam, Tho proposed the creation of a \"council of national reconciliation\" that would govern the nation, but in the meantime Thi\u1ec7u could stay in power until the council was formed while a \"leopard's spot\" ceasefire would come into effect with the Viet Cong and the Saigon government controlling whatever territories they were had at the time of the ceasefire.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=648}} The \"mutual withdrawal formula\" was to be disregarded with PAVN forces to stay in South Vietnam with Tho giving Kissinger a vague promise that no more supplies would be sent down the Ho Chi Minh Trail.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=648}} Kissinger accepted Tho's offer as the most best deal possible, saying that the \"mutual withdrawal formula\" had to be abandoned as it been \"unobtainable through ten years of war...We could not make it a condition for a final settlement. We had long passed that threshold\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=648}} Several of Kissinger's own staff, most notably [[John Negroponte]], were strongly opposed to him accepting this offer, saying Kissinger had given away more than he had obtained.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=648}} In response to Negronponte's objections, Kissinger exploded in rage, accusing him of \"nit-picking\" and screamed at the top of his voice: \"You don't understand. I want to meet their terms. I want to reach an agreement. I want to end this war before the election. It can be done and it will be done...What do you want us to do? Stay there forever?\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=648}}\n\nReflecting the \"leopard's spot\" ceasefire, Kissinger sent Thi\u1ec7u a message saying he should \"seize as much territory as possible\" before the ceasefire came into effect while the United States launched Operation Enhance Plus to give South Vietnam as many weapons as possible.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=648\u2013649}} Over the course of six weeks in the fall of 1972, South Vietnam ended up with the world's fourth largest air force as the Americans provided as war planes as possibly could.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=649}} However, neither Kissinger nor Nixon appreciated that for Thi\u1ec7u any sort of peace deal calling for withdrawal of American forces was unacceptable and he saw the draft peace agreement that Kissinger signed in Paris on 18 October 1972 as a betrayal.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=650}} On 21 October Kissinger together with the American ambassador Ellsworth Bunker arrived at the Gia Long Palace in Saigon to show Thi\u1ec7u the peace agreement.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=650}} The meeting went extremely badly with Thi\u1ec7u engaged that Kissinger did not take the time to translate the draft peace treaty into Vietnamese, bringing with him only an English language copy.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=650}}&nbsp;The meeting went from bad to worse with Thi\u1ec7u having a meltdown as he broke down in tears and hysterically accused Kissinger of plotting with the Soviet Union and China to betray him, saying he could never accept this peace agreement.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=650}} Thi\u1ec7u refused to sign the peace agreement and demanded very extensive amendments that Kissinger reported to Nixon \"verge on insanity\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=650}} Nixon ordered Kissinger to \"push Thi\u1ec7u as far as possible\", but Thi\u1ec7u refused to sign the peace agreement.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=650}} As Kissinger returned to Washington, one of his aides recalled \"In twenty-four hours, the bottom fell out\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=648}}\n\nThrough Nixon had initially supported Kissinger against Thi\u1ec7u, but two of his most influential advisers, namely his Chief of Staff, [[H.R. Haldeman]] and the Domestic Affairs Adviser [[John Ehrlichman]] urged him to reconsider, arguing that Kissinger had given away too much and Thi\u1ec7u's objections had merit.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} As Thi\u1ec7u sensed Nixon's changing mood, on 24 October 1972 he called a press conference to denounce the draft agreement as a betrayal and stated the Viet Cong \"must be wiped out quickly and mercilessly\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} On October 26, North Vietnam published the draft agreement and accused the United States of tying to \"sabotage\" it by backing Thi\u1ec7u.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} On the same day, Kissinger who until then had never spoken to the media called a press conference at the White House to say: \"We believe peace is at hand. We believe an agreement is within sight\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} Kissinger later admitted that this statement was a major mistake as it inflated hopes for peace while enraging Nixon who saw it as weakness.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} Nixon came very close to disavowed Kissinger as he declared the draft peace agreement had \"differences that must be resolved\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} Taking up Thi\u1ec7u's cause as his own, Nixon wanted 69 amendments to the draft peace agreement included in the final treaty and ordered Kissinger back to Paris to force Tho to accept them.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} Kissinger regarded Nixons' 69 amendments as \"preposterous\" as he knew Tho would never accept them.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} By this point, Kissinger's relations with Nixon were tense while Nixon's \"German shepherds\" Haldeman and Ehrlichman intrigued against him.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}}\n\nAs expected, Tho refused to consider any of the 69 amendments and on 13 December 1972 left Paris for Hanoi after he accused the Americans of negotiating in bad faith.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=652}} Kissinger by this stage was worked up into a state of fury after Tho walked out of the Paris talks and told Nixon: \"They're just a bunch of shits.

Sadat's liked to say that his favorite game was backgammon, a game where skill and persistence was rewarded, but was best won by sudden gambles, making an analogy between how he played backgammon and conducted his diplomacy.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=393}} Under Nasser, Egypt and Saudi Arabia had engaged what was known as the [[Arab Cold War]], but Sadat got along very well with King [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia]], forming an alliance between the most populous Arab state and the most wealthiest Arab state. Kissinger later admitted that he was engrossed with the Paris peace talks to end Vietnam war that he and others in Washington missed the significance of the Egyptian-Saudi alliance. At the same that Sadat moved closer to Saudi Arabia, he also wanted a rapprochement with the United States and to move Egypt away from its alliance with the Soviet Union. In July 1972, Sadat expelled all 16, 000 of the Soviet military personnel in Egypt in a signal that he wanted better relations with the United States. Kissinger was taken completely by surprise by Sadat's move, saying: \"Why has he done me this favor? Why didn't he demand all sorts of concessions first?\"{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=393}}\n\nSadat expected as a reward that the United States would respond by pressuring Israel to return the Sinai to Egypt, but after his anti-Soviet move prompted no response from the United States, by November 1972 Sadat moved again closer to the Soviet Union, buying a massive amount of Soviet arms for a war he planned to launch against Israel in 1973. For Sadat, cost was no object as the money to buy Soviet arms came from Saudi Arabia.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=393\u2013394}} At the same time, Faisal promised Sadat that if it should come to war, Saudi Arabia would embargo oil to the West. In April 1973, the Saudi Oil Minister [[Ahmed Zaki Yamani]] visited Washington to meet Kissinger and told him that King Faisal was becoming more and more unhappy with the United States, saying he wanted America to pressure Israel to return all the lands captured in the Six Day War of 1967.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=398\u2013399}} In a later interview, Yamani accused Kissinger of not taking his warning seriously, saying all he did was to ask him not to speak anymore of this threat.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=399}} Angry at Kissinger, Yamani in an interview with the ''Washington Post'' on 19 April 1973 warned that King Faisal was considering an oil embargo.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=399}} At the time, the general feeling in Washington was the Saudis were bluffing and nothing would come of their threat to impose an oil embargo.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=400\u2013401}}&nbsp;The fact that Faisal's ineffectual half brother King Saud had imposed a cripplingly oil embargo on Britain and France during the Suez War of 1956 was not considered an important precedent.

Likewise, Kissinger regarded Meir as being rather arrogant and believed that an armistice that ended the war in a manner that was not an unambiguous Israeli victory would make her more humble.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=408}} As both Syria and Egypt lost much equipment during the fighting, the Soviet Union began to fly new equipment in starting on 12 October, and the Soviet flights to Syria and Egypt were recorded by the British radar stations in Cyprus.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=408}} Through the Soviets were flying in an average of 60 flights per day, exaggerated accounts appeared in Western newspapers speaking of \"one hundred flights per day\".{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=408\u2013409}} At this point, both Nixon and Kissinger began to see the October War more in terms of the Cold War rather than Middle Eastern politics, both seeing the Soviet arms lifts to Egypt and Syria as a Soviet power play that required an American answer.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=408\u2013409}}\n\nIsrael took heavy losses in men and material during the fighting against Egypt and Syria, and on 18 October 1973 Meir requested $850 million worth of American arms and equipment to replace its material losses.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=409\u2013410}} Nixon decided characteristically to act on an epic scale and instead of the $850 million worth of arms requested sent some $2 billion worth of arms to Israel as he boasted that the U.S. Air Force flew more sorties to Israel in October 1973 than it had during the Berlin Airlift of 1948\u201349.<ref>Arnon Gutfeld  and Boaz Vanetik. \"\u2018A Situation That Had to Be Manipulated\u2019: The American Airlift to Israel During the Yom Kippur War.\" ''Middle Eastern Studies'' 52.3 (2016): 419-447.</ref>  In an interview with the British historian [[Robert Lacey]] in 1981, Kissinger later admitted about the arms lift to Israel: \"I made a mistake.

The years from 1945 to 1973 had been a period of unprecedented prosperity in the West, a \"long summer\" that many believed would never end, and its abrupt end in 1973 as the oil embargo which increased the price of oil by 400% within a matter of days threw the world's economy into a sharp recession with unemployment mounting and inflation raging came as a profound shock.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=414\u2013416}} The end of what the French called the ''Trente Glorieuses'' (\"Glorious Thirty\") led to a mood of widespread pessimism in the West with the ''Financial Times'' running a famous headline in late 1973 saying \"The Future will be subject to Delay\".{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=416\u2013417}}\n\nIn the midst of the war, in what journalist Elizabeth Drew called \u201cStrangelove Day,\u201d Kissinger put U.S. military forces on [[DEFCON]] 3 late in the evening of October 24, in what a historian argues is \"best understood as an emotional response to a misunderstanding\" with Soviet ambassador to the United States [[Anatoly Dobrynin]].<ref name=\"Barbara Keys 2011\"/>\n\nIsrael regained the territory it lost in the early fighting and gained new territories from Syria and Egypt, including land in Syria east of the previously captured [[Golan Heights]], and additionally on the western bank of the [[Suez Canal]], although they did lose some territory on the eastern side of the Suez Canal that had been in Israeli hands since the end of the [[Six-Day War]]. During a summit in Cairo on 6 November, Kissinger asked Sadat what Faisal was like and was told: \"Well, Dr. Henry, he will probably go on with you about Communism and the Jews\".{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=417}} King Faisal's two great hatreds were Communism and Zionism as he believed that the Soviet Union and Israel were plotting together against Islam.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=385\u2013386}} When King Faisal was shown a translation into Arabic of ''The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion'', he instantly believed in the authenticity of ''The Protocols'' and therefore talked to anyone who would listen about what he had learned, despite the fact that ''The Protocols'' had been exposed as a forgery in 1921.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=385\u2013386}} On 7 November 1973, Kissinger flew to Riyadh to meet King Faisal and ask him to end the oil embargo in exchange for promising to be \"evenhanded\" with the Arab-Israeli dispute.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=417}} As the plane carrying him prepared to land in Riyadh, Kissinger was clearly nervous at the prospect of negotiating with the stern Wahhabi Faisal who had a marked dislike of Jews.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=417}} Kissinger discovered that King Faisal was a worthy companion to [[L\u00ea \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1ecd]] in terms of stubbornness as the king accused the United States of being biased in favor of Israel, instead engaging in a long rant about the balefulness of \"Jewish Communists\" in Russia and Israel, and despite all of Kissinger's efforts to charm him, refused to end the oil embargo.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=418\u2013419}} In February 1974, King Faisal chaired the second summit of Islamic states (which unlike the first summit Faisal had chaired in 1969 was not boycotted by Iraq and Syria), where he was acclaimed as a conquering hero who humiliated and humbled the West by wrecking its economy, and henceforward Kissinger had to face a bloc of Muslim states who were far more assertive and self-confident than before.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=419\u2013420}}\n\nOnly on 19 March 1974 did the king end the oil embargo after Sadat, whom he trusted, reported to him that the United States was being more \"evenhanded\" and after Kissinger had promised to sell Saudi Arabia weapons that it had previously denied under the grounds that they might be used against Israel.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=420\u2013421}} More importantly, Saudi Arabia had billions of dollars invested in Western banks, and the massive bout of inflation set off by the oil embargo was a threat to this fortune as inflation eroded the value of the money, giving Faisal a vested interest in helping to contain the damage he himself inflicted on the economies of the West.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=421}}\n\nKissinger pressured the Israelis to [[cede]] some of the newly captured land back to its Arab neighbors, contributing to the first phases of Israeli\u2013Egyptian non-aggression. In 1973\u201374, Kissinger engaged in \"shuttle diplomacy\" flying between Tel Avi, Cairo and Damascus in a bid to make the armistice the basis of a preferment peace.

He might then allow himself to be driven back to the attainable, fighting a dogged rear guard action that made clear that concessions could be exacted only at a heavy price and that discouraged excessive expectations of them.

The move saw a warming in [[Foreign relations of Egypt#United States|U.S.\u2013Egyptian relations]], bitter since the 1950s, as the country moved away from its former independent stance and into a close partnership with the United States. The peace was finalized in 1978 when U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] mediated the [[Camp David Accords (1978)|Camp David Accords]], during which Israel returned the [[Sinai Peninsula]] in exchange for an Egyptian peace agreement that included the recognition of the state of Israel.\n\n===The Persian Gulf===\nA major concern for Kissinger was the possibility of Soviet influence in the oil-rich region of the Persian Gulf. Iraq had been ruled by the Baath Party since 1968, and in April 1969 came into conflict with Iran when Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] renounced the 1937 treaty governing the Shatt-al-Arab river. After two years of skirmishes along the border, President [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]] broke off diplomatic relations with Iran on 1 December 1971.{{sfnp|Zonis|1991|p=69}} On 9 April 1972, Iraq signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union.{{sfnp|Zonis|1991|p=69}} In May 1972, Nixon and Kissinger visited Tehran to tell the Shah that there would be no \"second-guessing of his requests\" to buy American weapons.{{sfnp|Zonis|1991|p=69}} At the same time, Nixon and Kissinger agreed a plan of the Shah's that the United States together with Iran and Israel would support the Kurdish ''peshmerga'' guerrillas fighting for independence from Iraq.{{sfnp|Zonis|1991|p=69}} Kissinger later wrote that after Vietnam, there was no possibility of deploying American forces in the Middle East, and henceforward Iran was to act as America's surrogate in the Persian Gulf.{{sfnp|Zonis|1991|p=201}} Kissinger described the Baathist regime in Iraq as a potential threat to the United States and believed that building up Iran and supporting the ''peshmerga'' was the best counterweight.{{sfnp|Zonis|1991|p=201}}\n\nKissinger wrote about the last Shah: \"[he] had been restored to the throne in 1953 by American influence when a leftist government had come close to toppling him. He never forgot that; it may have been the root of his extraordinary trust in American purposes and American goodwill, and of his psychological disintegration when he sensed that friendship evaporating. On some levels excessively, even morbidly, suspicious of possible attempts to diminish his authority, he nevertheless retained an almost naive faith in the United States\".{{sfnp|Zonis|1991|p=166}} An essentially weak man, the Shah's ego was greatly inflated when Nixon and Kissinger told him that he was to be America's \"man in the Persian Gulf\", and he began to display signs of the megalomania that characterized his reign until his overthrow in the Iranian Revolution.{{sfnp|Zonis|1991|p=210}} A childlike man whose upbringing was warped by his overbearing and violent father, Reza Khan, the last Shah had a pathological and desperate need for American approval that closely resembled the way he needed his father's approval which he never received.{{sfnp|Zonis|1991|pp=210\u2013211}} Once Mohammad Reza felt he finally had the approval of the United States, his ego became inflated, leading to his belief that he was always right because America approved of him.{{sfnp|Zonis|1991|p=210}}\n\nTo put further pressure on Iraq, in the winter of 1974\u201375, the ''peshmerga'' were encouraged by Iran and the United States to switch from guerrilla warfare to conventional war, marking the sharpest point in the fighting.<ref name=Brogan>{{cite book|last=Brogan|first=Patrick|title=World Conflicts|publisher=Bloomsburgy|year=1989|p=298|isbn=0810835517}}</ref>  In March 1975, Mohammad Reza signed the Algiers Accord with Vice President [[Saddam Hussein]] of Iraq which settled the dispute over the Shatt-al-Arab river to Iran's satisfaction, and at which point Iran, Israel and the United States abandoned the ''peshmerga'' to their fate, cutting off the arms supplies.{{sfnp|Zonis|1991|p=70}} The sudden ending of support caused the overexposed ''peshmerga'' to be rapidly defeated and as the British journalist Patrick Brogan noted that \"...the Iraqis celebrated their victory in the usual manner, by executing as many of the rebels as they could lay their hands on\".<ref name=Brogan/> At the time, Kissinger stated: \"Fuck the Kurds if they can\u2019t take a joke\" and \u201ccovert action should not be confused with missionary work.\u201d<ref>{{cite news |last1=Riede |first1=Bruce |title=Masoud Barzani and the roots of Kurdish distrust of the United States |url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2017/11/02/masoud-barzani-and-the-roots-of-kurdish-distrust-of-the-united-states/ |accessdate=13 January 2020 |publisher=Brookings Institution |date=2 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Turkish invasion of Cyprus===\n{{See also|Turkish invasion of Cyprus}}\nFollowing a period of steady relations between the U.S. Government and the [[Greek junta|Greek military regime]] after 1967, Secretary of State Kissinger was faced with the coup by the Greek junta and the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in July and August 1974.

He lives with his grandfather, Grim, and grandmother, Gram. Max thinks of himself as a big butthead. People are afraid of him because he looks like his father, Kenneth \"Killer\" Kane, a convicted murderer. Max sets the stage for the story by reminiscing about his time in daycare, when he had met a boy named Kevin, or Freak, as their classmates called him. Kevin has a condition called [[Morquio syndrome]], wears leg braces and uses crutches, and thinks of himself as a robot and is bullied by many bigger kids due to his short height. However, Max likes Kevin and thinks the crutches and leg braces are neat.\n\nMany years later, when Max is in middle school, he finds out that Freak and his mother, Gwen (referred to as \"The Fair Guinevere\") are moving into the house next door. When Max initially approaches Freak, Freak acts with hostility. However, sometime later, Max saves Kevin's toy [[ornithopter]] from a tree and they start to become friends. On the Fourth of July, they go to see the fireworks show and are attacked by an older boy, Tony \"Blade\" D. and his gang but avoid any mental or physical conflict. After the show, Blade chases the two with his gang after Freak calls him a [[Cretinism|cretin]]. Despite Max's lack of knowledge and disability, he escapes by acting on Freak's orders, but the two are driven into a muddy [[millpond]], Freak riding on Max's shoulders.  Freak gets the attention of a nearby police car, who drives off Blade's gang and takes the boys home. After this incident, Kevin starts riding on Max's shoulders regularly. They begin to call themselves \"Freak the Mighty\". They go on adventures such as going to the hospital which Freak claims has a secret department called the \"Bionics Department\" which has had his brain [[Computed tomography|CT scanned]] to be fitted into a [[Bionics|bionic]] body.\n\nOn one adventure they find a woman's purse in the storm drain. They return it to the woman who is named Loretta Lee. She is the wife of Iggy Lee, leader of the Panheads, a motorcycle gang who \"struck fear in everyone, even the cops\", as Max puts it. Iggy says that the two of them once knew Max's father. They consider \"having some fun\" with the boys but don't because they are afraid that Max's father will get parole even though he's serving a life sentence. They also reveal that Kevin's father left once he heard that his son had a birth defect.\n\nFreak has an emergency at school and is taken to the hospital.  Later, Grim reveals to Max that his father has been released from prison on parole. Throughout the story, it has been gradually revealed that Max's father killed his mother by strangling her. Grim and Gram dislike his dad, and are afraid of Max ending up like him. Grim threatens to buy a gun for the family's protection. Max is shocked and scared by the news of his father's parole. On Christmas Eve, Max is woken up by his father, Killer Kane, who has come to take him to train him to be his assistant. After Max is kidnapped by his father, the two walk to Iggy Lee's apartment in the Testaments.\n\nKiller Kane is even bigger than Max and acts in a very threatening, intimidating manner towards everyone, including his son, whom he keeps tied up on a small chair. Killer Kane swears that he did not murder Max's mother and calls himself \"a man of God\". On Christmas morning he leaves Max alone, tied up in a room in an old abandoned apartment. Loretta, shocked that Kane would do something like that to his own child, tries to help him escape. Killer Kane catches her and starts to strangle her. He begins but is interrupted by Max. Max tries to get up and rips off the rope to which the old boiler has been attached. Max attempts to stop him and reveals that he witnessed his father kill his mother in the same fashion. Kane lets go of Loretta, letting her lie on the ground breathing like a \"broken bird\" and gives up on training Max to be his obedient assistant so he tries to murder him by strangling him, the same as what he did to Max's mother, but Freak arrives just in time and saves Max by squirting Kane with a squirt gun in the eye which he claims is filled with [[sulfuric acid]] when in fact, as Freak reveals later, it is filled with [[soap]], [[vinegar]], and [[curry powder]]. The police are waiting outside, and Killer Kane is taken back to prison and has to serve his original sentence plus ten years. Killer Kane pleads guilty.\n\nAfter having a [[seizure]] on his birthday, Freak is admitted into the hospital, where he gives Max a blank book, telling him to write the story of Freak the Mighty in it. Max returns to the hospital the next day to find that Freak died because his heart became too big for his body. Dr. Spivak, Kevin's doctor, reveals that Freak knew he was going to have a very short life, but he told Max he was going to get a bionic body because it would give himself hope. The Fair Gwen moves away, with a new man she is in love with, and Max misses Freak's funeral, staying in his room, the \"down under\" for months. Not even Grim or Gram can get him out, until Grim orders Max to return to school. One day, Max sees Loretta, who tells him \"Doing nothing's a drag, kid\", so Max writes all of the adventures he and Freak had, in honor of his best friend.\n\n==Characters==\n\n*'''Maxwell \"Max\" Kane''' is the main character and narrator of the story. He is described to be very big and have a striking resemblance to his father, Kenneth (Killer) Kane. In daycare, Max earned the nickname \"Kicker\" because he had a thing of booting and kicking anyone who dared to touch him, when he was a child. Max lives with his grandparents, Grim and Gram, and usually stays in \"The Down Under\", a small room in the basement. He hates his father, whom he witnessed killing his mother, Annie. He becomes best friends with Freak, who customarily rides on his shoulders and acts as Max's surrogate \"brain\".  Max becomes depressed after Freak dies, locking himself in \"The Down Under\" for days. He is also very insecure about himself. He usually calls himself a \"butthead\" and is never confident. Until Freak comes along, Max cannot read or write.\n* '''Kevin \"Freak\" Avery''' is a crippled, blonde-haired boy whom Max becomes best friends with. Kevin has [[Morquio syndrome]], where the outside of his body cannot grow. He walks on crutches and wears a leg brace. He is a genius for his age and size and is cuttingly sarcastic. He carries a dictionary with him. He is interested in [[Robotics]] and the tales of King Arthur, to the extent of calling his mother Gwen \"The Fair Gwen Of Air/[[Guinevere]] \" and calling his adventures with Max \"quests\". Kevin looks forward to his surgery (which Max later finds out was a lie so he wouldn't know the truth), in which he will gain a robot's body. Unexpectedly on his 13th birthday, Kevin has a [[seizure]]. In the hospital, he dies, because as his doctor puts it, \"his heart became too big for his body\". In the film, Kevin's last name was changed from Avery to Dillon.\n*'''Grim''' is Maxwell's grandfather. He is usually pretty grim, thus explaining why Maxwell gave him the nickname, although in real life he is a pretty friendly person. He dislikes Max's father because of what he did to Grim's daughter, Annie. In the book, Grim decides to shoot Kenneth if he sets foot in the house, after hearing about his release from jail. At first, Grim feels sorry for Kevin, but later, he appreciates Kevin's abilities and intelligence.\n*'''Gram''' is Maxwell's grandmother. Like her husband, she also dislikes Kenneth and misses her daughter, Annie. Gram is really kind and polite, careful not to hurt anyone's feelings. She protests against shooting Kenneth once Grim announces that he will do so.\n*'''Gwen \"Fair Gwen\" Avery''' is Kevin's beautiful and kind mother. Kevin nicknames her \"Fair Gwen\" after [[King Arthur]]'s beautiful wife, [[Guinevere|Fair Guinevere]]. She and Maxwell's mother were friends until Kenneth Kane came along.  After her son's death, Gwen moves to California and starts a relationship with a man named Rick.\n*'''Kenneth \"Kenny\" David Kane (also known as Killer Kane)''' is the main antagonist of the book. He is Max's selfish and sociopathic father. He was sent to prison for strangling his wife to death. After his release from prison on parole, Kenny kidnaps Maxwell on Christmas Eve and takes him to Loretta and Iggy's apartment. Loretta Lee tries to save Max but ends up getting strangled by Kenneth, though she survives. Eventually, Kevin rescues Max by spraying a mixture of soap, vinegar and curry powder in Kenny's eyes, which he claimed was sulfuric acid. In the end, Kenny is jailed.\n*'''Loretta Lee''' is a thin, red-haired lady whose stolen purse is recovered by Freak and Max. She is married to the leader of a motorcycle gang named The Panheads, Iggy. Loretta is an alcoholic and a smoker and lives in the \"poor\" part of the town, the Testaments. When she attempts to help Max escape, she is almost strangled to death by Kenny Kane.\n*'''Iggy Lee''' is an alcoholic, like Loretta, and lives with her in the Testaments. He is the boss of The Panheads, a motorcycle gang. It is suggested that he may have [[vertigo]], as he states it makes him nervous looking up. He was also a friend of Maxwell's dad (Killer Kane), who makes him scared and nervous. He attempts to help rescue Max when he was kidnapped by his father. He is the husband of Loretta Lee.\n*'''Dr. Spivak''' is Kevin's doctor. She tells Max about Kevin's death and that the real cause of his death was his heart growing too big for his body.\n*'''Annie Kane''' is Maxwell's mother but does not appear in the book. She was brutally murdered by her husband, Kenneth Kane.\n*'''Tony D.''' is a juvenile delinquent who first encountered Max and Freak during the Fourth of July drunkenly asking them for M-80 fireworks and along with his nasty gang tried to harm Max and Freak with a knife. His gang steals Loretta Lee's purse. He later tells Max he's sorry about Kevin (Freak), who died after having a seizure, though Max doesn't like it and wants to be enemies with him. He is also known as \"Blade\".\n*'''Rick''' does not appear in this book. After Kevin Avery dies, he starts a relationship with Gwen Avery in California.\n*'''Mr. Meehan''' is Maxwell's reading skills tutor.\n*'''Mrs. Donelli''' is Maxwell's new English teacher.\n*'''Mrs. Addison''' is the school's principal.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:1993 novels]]\n[[Category:Novels by Rodman Philbrick]]\n[[Category:American young adult novels]]\n[[Category:Novels about friendship]]\n[[Category:Novels set in New Hampshire]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Novel by Rodman Philbrick}}\n{{about|the book|the film|The Mighty}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{primary sources|date=November 2015}}\n{{refimprove|date=November 2015}}\n}}\n{{Infobox book \n| name          = Freak the Mighty\n| image         = FreakTheMightyBookCover.jpg\n| image_size = \n| caption = First edition\n| author        = [[Rodman Philbrick]]\n| cover_artist  = [[David Shannon]]\n| country       = United States\n| genre         = [[Young Adult fiction]]\n| publisher     = Blue Sky/[[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]]\n| release_date  = 1993\n| media_type    = Print\n| pages         = 160\n| isbn          = 0-7857-6594-8\n| preceded_by   =\n| followed_by   = [[Max the Mighty]]\n}}\n\n'''''Freak the Mighty''''' is a [[young adult novel]] by [[Rodman Philbrick]].

Kevin is diagnosed with [[Morquio syndrome]].\n\nThe novel was adapted for the screen under the title ''[[The Mighty]]'' by [[Charles Leavitt]]; the film was shot in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada and [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], and directed by [[Peter Chelsom]], and released in 1998.<ref>Peter Chelsom, ''The Mighty'', Chaos Productions, 1998.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe novel is set in a version of [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Rodman Philbrick|title=Freak The Mighty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V3tRg4C1rKIC&pg=PT147|date=1 March 2013|publisher=Scholastic Inc.|isbn=978-0-545-60027-9|pages=147\u2013}}</ref> In the beginning of the book, Maxwell Kane is a young boy with low [[self-esteem]]. He lives with his grandfather, Grim, and grandmother, Gram. Max thinks of himself as a big butthead. People are afraid of him because he looks like his father, Kenneth \"Killer\" Kane, a convicted murderer. Max sets the stage for the story by reminiscing about his time in daycare, when he had met a boy named Kevin, or Freak, as their classmates called him. Kevin has [[Morquio syndrome]], wears leg braces and uses crutches, and thinks of himself as a robot and is bullied by many bigger kids due to his short height. However, Max likes Kevin and thinks the crutches and leg braces are neat.\n\nMany years later, when Max is in middle school, he finds out that Freak and his mother, Gwen (referred to as \"The Fair Guinevere\") are moving into the house next door. When Max initially approaches Freak, Freak acts with hostility. However, sometime later, Max saves Kevin's toy [[ornithopter]] from a tree and they start to become friends. On the Fourth of July, they go to see the fireworks show and are attacked by an older boy, Tony \"Blade\" D. and his gang but avoid any mental or physical conflict. After the show, Blade chases the two with his gang after Freak calls him a [[Cretinism|cretin]]. Despite Max's lack of knowledge and disability, he escapes by acting on Freak's orders, but the two are driven into a muddy [[millpond]], Freak riding on Max's shoulders.  Freak gets the attention of a nearby police car, who drives off Blade's gang and takes the boys home. After this incident, Kevin starts riding on Max's shoulders regularly. They begin to call themselves \"Freak the Mighty\". They go on adventures such as going to the hospital which Freak claims has a secret department called the \"Bionics Department\" which has had his brain [[Computed tomography|CT scanned]] to be fitted into a [[Bionics|bionic]] body.\n\nOn one adventure they find a woman's purse in the storm drain. They return it to the woman who is named Loretta Lee. She is the wife of Iggy Lee, leader of the Panheads, a motorcycle gang who \"struck fear in everyone, even the cops\", as Max puts it. Iggy says that the two of them once knew Max's father. They consider \"having some fun\" with the boys but don't because they are afraid that Max's father will get parole even though he's serving a life sentence. They also reveal that Kevin's father left once he heard that his son had a birth defect.\n\nFreak has an emergency at school and is taken to the hospital.  Later, Grim reveals to Max that his father has been released from prison on parole. Throughout the story, it has been gradually revealed that Max's father killed his mother by strangling her.

On the following day, a [[geomagnetic storm]] was observed, and Carrington suspected that there might be a connection, which is now attributed to the arrival of the coronal mass ejection in near-Earth space and its subsequent interaction with the Earth's magnetosphere. [[George Francis FitzGerald|George FitzGerald]] later suggested that matter was being regularly accelerated away from the Sun and was reaching the Earth after several days.<ref name=meyer-vernet>{{cite book\n | first=Nicole | last=Meyer-Vernet | date=2007\n | title=Basics of the Solar Winds\n | publisher=Cambridge University Press\n | isbn=978-0-521-81420-1 }}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Birkeland-anode-globe-fig259.jpg|thumb|250px|Laboratory simulation of the magnetosphere's influence on the solar wind; these auroral-like [[Birkeland current]]s were created in a [[terrella]], a magnetised anode globe in an evacuated chamber.]]\n\nIn 1910 British astrophysicist [[Arthur Eddington]] essentially suggested the existence of the solar wind, without naming it, in a footnote to an article on [[Comet Morehouse]].<ref name=durham>{{cite news\n| first=Ian T. | last=Durham | date=2006\n| title=Rethinking the History of Solar Wind Studies: Eddington's Analysis of Comet Morehouse\n| url=http://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/60/3/261.abstract\n| journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society | volume=60 | pages=261\u2013270}}</ref> The idea never fully caught on even though Eddington had also made a similar suggestion at a Royal Institution address the previous year.

As these displays and other geomagnetic activity were being produced by particles from the Sun, he concluded that the Earth was being continually bombarded by \"rays of electric corpuscles emitted by the Sun\".<ref name=\"meyer-vernet\" /> In 1916, Birkeland proposed that, \"From a physical point of view it is most probable that solar rays are neither exclusively negative nor positive rays, but of both kinds\". In other words, the solar wind consists of both negative electrons and positive [[ions]].<ref>Kristian Birkeland, \"Are the Solar Corpuscular Rays that penetrate the Earth's Atmosphere Negative or Positive Rays?\" in ''Videnskapsselskapets Skrifter'', I Mat - Naturv.

Later spectroscopic work confirmed this extraordinary temperature. In the mid-1950s [[Sydney Chapman (astronomer)|Sydney Chapman]] calculated the properties of a gas at such a temperature and determined it was such a superb conductor of heat that it must extend way out into space, beyond the orbit of Earth. Also in the 1950s, [[Ludwig Biermann]] became interested in the fact that no matter whether a [[comet]] is headed towards or away from the Sun, its tail always points away from the Sun.

CMEs are caused by release of magnetic energy at the Sun. CMEs are often called \"solar storms\" or \"space storms\" in the popular media. They are sometimes, but not always, associated with [[solar flare]]s, which are another manifestation of magnetic energy release at the Sun. CMEs cause shock waves in the thin plasma of the heliosphere, launching electromagnetic [[wave]]s and accelerating particles (mostly [[proton]]s and [[electrons]]) to form showers of [[ionizing radiation]] that precede the CME.\n\nWhen a CME impacts the Earth's [[magnetosphere]], it temporarily deforms the Earth's [[magnetic field]], changing the direction of [[compass]] needles and inducing large electrical ground currents in Earth itself; this is called a [[geomagnetic storm]] and it is a global phenomenon. CME impacts can induce [[magnetic reconnection]] in Earth's [[Magnetosphere#Magnetic tails|magnetotail]] (the midnight side of the [[magnetosphere]]); this launches protons and electrons downward toward Earth's atmosphere, where they form the [[Aurora (phenomenon)|aurora]].\n\nCMEs are not the only cause of [[space weather]]. Different patches on the Sun are known to give rise to slightly different speeds and densities of wind depending on local conditions. In isolation, each of these different wind streams would form a spiral with a slightly different angle, with fast-moving streams moving out more directly and slow-moving streams wrapping more around the Sun. Fast moving streams tend to overtake slower streams that originate [[west]]ward of them on the Sun, forming turbulent co-rotating interaction regions that give rise to wave motions and accelerated particles, and that affect Earth's magnetosphere in the same way as, but more gently than, CMEs.\n\n==Solar System effects==\n{{Main|Space weather}}\n[[File:Heliospheric-current-sheet.gif|250px|thumb|The [[heliospheric current sheet]] results from the influence of the Sun's rotating magnetic field on the plasma in the solar wind]]\n\nOver the Sun's lifetime, the interaction of its surface layers with the escaping solar wind has significantly decreased its surface rotation rate.<ref>{{cite journal\n | last=Endal | first=A.

The solar wind flows from left to right.]]\n\nWhere the solar wind intersects with a planet that has a well-developed [[magnetic field]] (such as Earth, Jupiter or Saturn), the particles are deflected by the [[Lorentz force]]. This region, known as the [[magnetosphere]], causes the particles to travel around the planet rather than bombarding the atmosphere or surface. The magnetosphere is roughly shaped like a [[Sphere|hemisphere]] on the side facing the Sun, then is drawn out in a long wake on the opposite side. The boundary of this region is called the [[magnetopause]], and some of the particles are able to penetrate the magnetosphere through this region by partial reconnection of the magnetic field lines.<ref name=\"encrenaz\" />\n\n[[File:Solar Wind and Earth's magnetic field.png|thumb|Noon meridian section of magnetosphere]]\n\nThe solar wind is responsible for the overall shape of Earth's magnetosphere. Fluctuations in its speed, density, direction, and [[Interplanetary magnetic field|entrained magnetic field]] strongly affect Earth's local space environment. For example, the levels of ionizing radiation and radio interference can vary by factors of hundreds to thousands; and the shape and location of the magnetopause and bow [[shock wave]] upstream of it can change by several Earth radii, exposing [[Geosynchronous orbit|geosynchronous]] satellites to the direct solar wind. These phenomena are collectively called [[space weather]].\n\nFrom the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[Cluster II (spacecraft)|Cluster]] mission, a new study has taken place that proposes that it is easier for the solar wind to infiltrate the magnetosphere than previously believed. A group of scientists directly observed the existence of certain waves in the solar wind that were not expected. A recent study shows that these waves enable incoming charged particles of solar wind to breach the magnetopause. This suggests that the magnetic bubble forms more as a filter than a continuous barrier. This latest discovery occurred through the distinctive arrangement of the four identical Cluster spacecraft, which fly in a controlled configuration through near-Earth space. As they sweep from the magnetosphere into interplanetary space and back again, the fleet provides exceptional three-dimensional insights on the phenomena that connect the sun to Earth.\n\nThe research characterised variances in formation of the [[interplanetary magnetic field]] (IMF) largely influenced by [[Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz instability]] (which occur at the interface of two fluids) as a result of differences in thickness and numerous other characteristics of the boundary layer. Experts believe that this was the first occasion that the appearance of Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz waves at the magnetopause had been displayed at high latitude dawnward orientation of the IMF. These waves are being seen in unforeseen places under solar wind conditions that were formerly believed to be undesired for their generation. These discoveries show how Earth's magnetosphere can be penetrated by solar particles under specific IMF circumstances. The findings are also relevant to studies of magnetospheric progressions around other planetary bodies. This study suggests that Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz waves can be a somewhat common, and possibly constant, instrument for the entrance of solar wind into terrestrial magnetospheres under various IMF orientations.<ref>NASA Study Using Cluster Reveals New Insights Into Solar Wind, NASA, Greenbelt, 2012, p.1</ref>\n\n===Atmospheres===\nThe solar wind affects other incoming [[cosmic ray]]s interacting with planetary atmospheres. Moreover, planets with a weak or non-existent magnetosphere are subject to atmospheric stripping by the solar wind.\n\n[[Venus]], the nearest and most similar planet to Earth, has 100 times denser atmosphere, with little or no geo-magnetic field.

A smaller number of particles from the solar wind manage to travel, as though on an electromagnetic energy transmission line, to the Earth's upper atmosphere and [[ionosphere]] in the auroral zones. The only time the solar wind is observable on the Earth is when it is strong enough to produce phenomena such as the [[aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] and [[geomagnetic storm]]s. Bright auroras strongly heat the ionosphere, causing its plasma to expand into the magnetosphere, increasing the size of the plasma [[geosphere]] and injecting atmospheric matter into the solar wind.

CMEs are caused by release of magnetic energy at the Sun. CMEs are often called \"solar storms\" or \"space storms\" in the popular media. They are sometimes, but not always, associated with [[solar flare]]s, which are another manifestation of magnetic energy release at the Sun. CMEs cause shock waves in the thin plasma of the heliosphere, launching electromagnetic [[wave]]s and accelerating particles (mostly [[proton]]s and [[electrons]]) to form showers of [[ionizing radiation]] that precede the CME.\n\nWhen a CME impacts the Earth's [[magnetosphere]], it temporarily deforms the Earth's [[magnetic field]], changing the direction of [[compass]] needles and inducing large electrical ground currents in Earth itself; this is called a [[geomagnetic storm]] and it is a global phenomenon. CME impacts can induce [[magnetic reconnection]] in Earth's [[Magnetosphere#Magnetic tails|magnetotail]] (the midnight side of the [[magnetosphere]]); this launches protons and electrons downward toward Earth's atmosphere, where they form the [[Aurora (phenomenon)|aurora]].\n\nCMEs are not the only cause of [[space weather]]. Different patches on the Sun are known to give rise to slightly different speeds and densities of wind depending on local conditions. In isolation, each of these different wind streams would form a spiral with a slightly different angle, with fast-moving streams moving out more directly and slow-moving streams wrapping more around the Sun. Fast moving streams tend to overtake slower streams that originate [[west]]ward of them on the Sun, forming turbulent co-rotating interaction regions that give rise to wave motions and accelerated particles, and that affect Earth's magnetosphere in the same way as, but more gently than, CMEs.\n\n==Solar System effects==\n{{Main|Space weather}}\n[[File:Heliospheric-current-sheet.gif|250px|thumb|The [[heliospheric current sheet]] results from the influence of the Sun's rotating magnetic field on the plasma in the solar wind]]\n\nOver the Sun's lifetime, the interaction of its surface layers with the escaping solar wind has significantly decreased its surface rotation rate.<ref>{{cite journal\n | last=Endal | first=A.

The solar wind flows from left to right.]]\n\nWhere the solar wind intersects with a planet that has a well-developed [[magnetic field]] (such as Earth, Jupiter or Saturn), the particles are deflected by the [[Lorentz force]]. This region, known as the [[magnetosphere]], causes the particles to travel around the planet rather than bombarding the atmosphere or surface. The magnetosphere is roughly shaped like a [[Sphere|hemisphere]] on the side facing the Sun, then is drawn out in a long wake on the opposite side. The boundary of this region is called the [[magnetopause]], and some of the particles are able to penetrate the magnetosphere through this region by partial reconnection of the magnetic field lines.<ref name=\"encrenaz\" />\n\n[[File:Solar Wind and Earth's magnetic field.png|thumb|Noon meridian section of magnetosphere]]\n\nThe solar wind is responsible for the overall shape of Earth's magnetosphere. Fluctuations in its speed, density, direction, and [[Interplanetary magnetic field|entrained magnetic field]] strongly affect Earth's local space environment. For example, the levels of ionizing radiation and radio interference can vary by factors of hundreds to thousands; and the shape and location of the magnetopause and bow [[shock wave]] upstream of it can change by several Earth radii, exposing [[Geosynchronous orbit|geosynchronous]] satellites to the direct solar wind. These phenomena are collectively called [[space weather]].\n\nFrom the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[Cluster II (spacecraft)|Cluster]] mission, a new study has taken place that proposes that it is easier for the solar wind to infiltrate the magnetosphere than previously believed. A group of scientists directly observed the existence of certain waves in the solar wind that were not expected. A recent study shows that these waves enable incoming charged particles of solar wind to breach the magnetopause. This suggests that the magnetic bubble forms more as a filter than a continuous barrier. This latest discovery occurred through the distinctive arrangement of the four identical Cluster spacecraft, which fly in a controlled configuration through near-Earth space. As they sweep from the magnetosphere into interplanetary space and back again, the fleet provides exceptional three-dimensional insights on the phenomena that connect the sun to Earth.\n\nThe research characterised variances in formation of the [[interplanetary magnetic field]] (IMF) largely influenced by [[Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz instability]] (which occur at the interface of two fluids) as a result of differences in thickness and numerous other characteristics of the boundary layer. Experts believe that this was the first occasion that the appearance of Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz waves at the magnetopause had been displayed at high latitude dawnward orientation of the IMF. These waves are being seen in unforeseen places under solar wind conditions that were formerly believed to be undesired for their generation. These discoveries show how Earth's magnetosphere can be penetrated by solar particles under specific IMF circumstances. The findings are also relevant to studies of magnetospheric progressions around other planetary bodies. This study suggests that Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz waves can be a somewhat common, and possibly constant, instrument for the entrance of solar wind into terrestrial magnetospheres under various IMF orientations.<ref>NASA Study Using Cluster Reveals New Insights Into Solar Wind, NASA, Greenbelt, 2012, p.1</ref>\n\n===Atmospheres===\nThe solar wind affects other incoming [[cosmic ray]]s interacting with planetary atmospheres. Moreover, planets with a weak or non-existent magnetosphere are subject to atmospheric stripping by the solar wind.\n\n[[Venus]], the nearest and most similar planet to Earth, has 100 times denser atmosphere, with little or no geo-magnetic field. Space probes discovered a comet-like tail that extends to Earth's orbit.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gr\u00fcnwaldt H|display-authors=etal |date=1997 |title=Venus tail ray observation near Earth |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=24 |issue=10 |pages=163\u20131166 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?num=100&hl=en&lr=&safe=active&cluster=13741676747552292586 | doi = 10.1029/97GL01159 |bibcode=1997GeoRL..24.1163G}}</ref>\n\nEarth itself is largely protected from the solar wind by [[Earth's magnetic field|its magnetic field]], which deflects most of the charged particles; however some of the charged particles are trapped in the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]. A smaller number of particles from the solar wind manage to travel, as though on an electromagnetic energy transmission line, to the Earth's upper atmosphere and [[ionosphere]] in the auroral zones. The only time the solar wind is observable on the Earth is when it is strong enough to produce phenomena such as the [[aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] and [[geomagnetic storm]]s. Bright auroras strongly heat the ionosphere, causing its plasma to expand into the magnetosphere, increasing the size of the plasma [[geosphere]] and injecting atmospheric matter into the solar wind. [[Geomagnetic storm]]s result when the pressure of plasmas contained inside the magnetosphere is sufficiently large to inflate and thereby distort the geomagnetic field.\n\nAlthough [[Mars]] is larger than Mercury and four times farther from the Sun, it is thought that the solar wind has stripped away up to a third of its original atmosphere, leaving a layer 1/100th as dense as the Earth's. It is believed the mechanism for this atmospheric stripping is gas caught in bubbles of magnetic field, which are ripped off by solar winds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.cosmosmagazine.com/news/solar-wind-ripping-chunks-mars/|title=Solar wind ripping chunks off Mars -|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072916/http://archive.cosmosmagazine.com/news/solar-wind-ripping-chunks-mars/|archivedate=2016-03-04}}</ref> In 2015 the NASA Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution ([[MAVEN]]) mission measured the rate of atmospheric stripping caused by the magnetic field carried by the solar wind as it flows past Mars, which generates an electric field, much as a turbine on Earth can be used to generate electricity.

During coronal mass ejections, however, the magnetopause may get pressed into the surface of the planet, and under these conditions, the solar wind may interact freely with the planetary surface.\n\nThe Earth's [[Moon]] has no atmosphere or intrinsic [[Magnetosphere|magnetic field]], and consequently its surface is bombarded with the full solar wind. The [[Apollo program|Project Apollo missions]] deployed passive aluminum collectors in an attempt to sample the solar wind, and lunar soil returned for study confirmed that the lunar [[regolith]] is enriched in atomic nuclei deposited from the solar wind.

Under the direction of the Translation Services Department, translation of the Old Testament in a particular language may be completed in as little as two years. During the period from 1963 to 1989, the ''New World Translation'' became available in ten additional languages.

The ''New World Translation'' employs nearly 16,000 English expressions to translate about 5,500 biblical Greek terms, and over 27,000 English expressions to translate about 8,500 Hebrew terms. The translators state that, where possible in the target language, the ''New World Translation'' prefers literal renderings and does not paraphrase the original text.<ref>How Can You Choose a Good Bible Translation?

The Hebrew texts, [[Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia]] and [[Biblia Hebraica Quinta]], were used for preparing the latest version of this translation. Other works consulted in preparing the translation include Aramaic [[Targum]]s, the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], the [[Samaritan Torah]], the Greek [[Septuagint]], the Latin [[Vulgate]], the [[Masoretic Text]], the [[Codex Cairensis|Cairo Codex]], the [[Aleppo Codex]], [[Christian David Ginsburg]]'s Hebrew Text, and the [[Leningrad Codex]].<ref name=\"autogenerated305\">[http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1101990132 \"All Scripture is Inspired of God and Beneficial\" 1990 pp. 305-314]</ref><ref>[http://www.jw.org/en/publications/bible/nwt/appendix-a/how-the-bible-came-to-us/ How the Bible Came to Us, Appendix A3 of 2013 REVISION]</ref>\n<gallery caption=\"Diagrammatic representation of textual basis\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:NWT-HS.jpg|Hebrew\nFile:NWT-GS.jpg|Greek\n</gallery>\n\nThe Greek master text by the [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] scholars [[Brooke Foss Westcott|B.

Bover (1943),{{sfn|Paul|2003|pp=85}} and Augustinus Merk (1948).{{sfn|Paul|2003|pp=85}} The [[United Bible Societies]]' text (1975) and the [[Erwin Nestle|Nestle]]-[[Kurt Aland|Aland]] text (1979) were used to update the footnotes in the 1984 version. Additional works consulted in preparing the ''New World Translation'' include the [[Armenian Bible translation|Armenian Version]], [[Coptic versions of the Bible|Coptic Versions]], the Latin Vulgate, [[Sixto-Clementine Vulgate|Sistine and Clementine Revised Latin Texts]], [[Textus Receptus]], the [[Johann Jakob Griesbach]]'s Greek text, the [[Emphatic Diaglott]], and various [[Papyrus#Collections of papyri|papyri]].<ref name=\"autogenerated305\"/>\n\n=== Other languages ===\nTranslation into other languages is based on the English text, supplemented by comparison with the Hebrew and Greek.<ref>Jehovah's Witnesses\u2014Proclaimers of God's Kingdom (1993) Chap. 27 p. 611, subheading Translation Into Other Languages.</ref> The complete ''New World Translation'' has been published in more than one hundred languages or [[writing system|scripts]], with the New Testament available in more than fifty additional languages.\n\nWhen the Writing Committee approves the translation of the Bible into a new language, it appoints a group of baptized Jehovah's Witnesses to serve as a translation team. Translators are given a list of words and expressions commonly used in the English ''New World Translation'' with related English words grouped together (e.g. ''atone'', ''atonement'' or ''propitiation''). A list of vernacular equivalents is then composed. A database of Greek and Hebrew terms is available where a translator has difficulty rendering a verse. The vernacular terms are then applied to the text in the target language. Further editing and translation is then performed to produce a final version.<ref name=translation />\n\n== Features ==\nThe layout resembles the 1901 edition of the [[American Standard Version]]. The translators use the terms \"Hebrew-Aramaic Scriptures\" and \"Christian Greek Scriptures\" rather than \"Old Testament\" and \"New Testament\", stating that the use of \"testament\" was based on a misunderstanding of 2 Corinthians 3:14.{{sfn|Chryssides|2009|pp=100}}<ref>Appendix 7E in the ''New World Translation'' reference edition</ref> Headings were included at the top of each page to assist in locating texts; these have been replaced in the 2013 revision by an \"Outline of Contents\" introducing each Bible book. There is also an index listing scriptures by subject.\n\nSquare brackets [ ] were added around words that were inserted editorially, but were removed as of the 2006 printing. Double brackets were used to indicate text considered doubtful. The pronoun \"you\" was printed in [[small capitals]] (i.e., <small>YOU</small>) to indicate plurality, as were some verbs when plurality may be unclear. These features were discontinued in the 2013 release. The ''New World Translation'' attempts to indicate progressive rather than completed actions, such as \"proceeded to rest\" at Genesis 2:2 instead of \"rested\". The 2013 release indicates progressive verbs only where considered contextually important.\n\n=== Use of ''Jehovah'' ===\n{{main|Jehovah}}\n{{see also|Names and titles of God in the New Testament}}\nThe name ''[[Jehovah]]'' is a translation of the [[Tetragrammaton]] ({{lang-he|\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4}}, transliterated as ''YHWH'', though the original pronunciation is unknown). The ''New World Translation'' uses the name ''Jehovah'' 6,979 times in the Old Testament.<ref>[http://www.jw.org/en/news/headlines/?v=2552828400#mid702013141 Revised ''New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures''].

Under the direction of the Translation Services Department, translation of the Old Testament in a particular language may be completed in as little as two years. During the period from 1963 to 1989, the ''New World Translation'' became available in ten additional languages.

The ''New World Translation'' employs nearly 16,000 English expressions to translate about 5,500 biblical Greek terms, and over 27,000 English expressions to translate about 8,500 Hebrew terms. The translators state that, where possible in the target language, the ''New World Translation'' prefers literal renderings and does not paraphrase the original text.<ref>How Can You Choose a Good Bible Translation? (Watchtower May 1, 2008 pp. 18\u201322)</ref>\n\n=== Textual basis ===\n\nThe master text used for translating the Old Testament into English was [[Biblia Hebraica (Kittel)|Kittel's Biblia Hebraica]]. The Hebrew texts, [[Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia]] and [[Biblia Hebraica Quinta]], were used for preparing the latest version of this translation. Other works consulted in preparing the translation include Aramaic [[Targum]]s, the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], the [[Samaritan Torah]], the Greek [[Septuagint]], the Latin [[Vulgate]], the [[Masoretic Text]], the [[Codex Cairensis|Cairo Codex]], the [[Aleppo Codex]], [[Christian David Ginsburg]]'s Hebrew Text, and the [[Leningrad Codex]].<ref name=\"autogenerated305\">[http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1101990132 \"All Scripture is Inspired of God and Beneficial\" 1990 pp. 305-314]</ref><ref>[http://www.jw.org/en/publications/bible/nwt/appendix-a/how-the-bible-came-to-us/ How the Bible Came to Us, Appendix A3 of 2013 REVISION]</ref>\n<gallery caption=\"Diagrammatic representation of textual basis\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:NWT-HS.jpg|Hebrew\nFile:NWT-GS.jpg|Greek\n</gallery>\n\nThe Greek master text by the [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] scholars [[Brooke Foss Westcott|B.

Hort]] (1881) was used as the basis for translating the New Testament into English.{{sfn|Paul|2003|pp=85}} The committee also referred to the [[Novum Testamentum Graece]] (18th edition, 1948) and to works by Jesuit scholars Jos\u00e9 M. Bover (1943),{{sfn|Paul|2003|pp=85}} and Augustinus Merk (1948).{{sfn|Paul|2003|pp=85}} The [[United Bible Societies]]' text (1975) and the [[Erwin Nestle|Nestle]]-[[Kurt Aland|Aland]] text (1979) were used to update the footnotes in the 1984 version. Additional works consulted in preparing the ''New World Translation'' include the [[Armenian Bible translation|Armenian Version]], [[Coptic versions of the Bible|Coptic Versions]], the Latin Vulgate, [[Sixto-Clementine Vulgate|Sistine and Clementine Revised Latin Texts]], [[Textus Receptus]], the [[Johann Jakob Griesbach]]'s Greek text, the [[Emphatic Diaglott]], and various [[Papyrus#Collections of papyri|papyri]].<ref name=\"autogenerated305\"/>\n\n=== Other languages ===\nTranslation into other languages is based on the English text, supplemented by comparison with the Hebrew and Greek.<ref>Jehovah's Witnesses\u2014Proclaimers of God's Kingdom (1993) Chap. 27 p. 611, subheading Translation Into Other Languages.</ref> The complete ''New World Translation'' has been published in more than one hundred languages or [[writing system|scripts]], with the New Testament available in more than fifty additional languages.\n\nWhen the Writing Committee approves the translation of the Bible into a new language, it appoints a group of baptized Jehovah's Witnesses to serve as a translation team. Translators are given a list of words and expressions commonly used in the English ''New World Translation'' with related English words grouped together (e.g. ''atone'', ''atonement'' or ''propitiation''). A list of vernacular equivalents is then composed. A database of Greek and Hebrew terms is available where a translator has difficulty rendering a verse. The vernacular terms are then applied to the text in the target language. Further editing and translation is then performed to produce a final version.<ref name=translation />\n\n== Features ==\nThe layout resembles the 1901 edition of the [[American Standard Version]]. The translators use the terms \"Hebrew-Aramaic Scriptures\" and \"Christian Greek Scriptures\" rather than \"Old Testament\" and \"New Testament\", stating that the use of \"testament\" was based on a misunderstanding of 2 Corinthians 3:14.{{sfn|Chryssides|2009|pp=100}}<ref>Appendix 7E in the ''New World Translation'' reference edition</ref> Headings were included at the top of each page to assist in locating texts; these have been replaced in the 2013 revision by an \"Outline of Contents\" introducing each Bible book. There is also an index listing scriptures by subject.\n\nSquare brackets [ ] were added around words that were inserted editorially, but were removed as of the 2006 printing. Double brackets were used to indicate text considered doubtful. The pronoun \"you\" was printed in [[small capitals]] (i.e., <small>YOU</small>) to indicate plurality, as were some verbs when plurality may be unclear. These features were discontinued in the 2013 release. The ''New World Translation'' attempts to indicate progressive rather than completed actions, such as \"proceeded to rest\" at Genesis 2:2 instead of \"rested\". The 2013 release indicates progressive verbs only where considered contextually important.\n\n=== Use of ''Jehovah'' ===\n{{main|Jehovah}}\n{{see also|Names and titles of God in the New Testament}}\nThe name ''[[Jehovah]]'' is a translation of the [[Tetragrammaton]] ({{lang-he|\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4}}, transliterated as ''YHWH'', though the original pronunciation is unknown). The ''New World Translation'' uses the name ''Jehovah'' 6,979 times in the Old Testament.<ref>[http://www.jw.org/en/news/headlines/?v=2552828400#mid702013141 Revised ''New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures''].

Another factor leading to abductions and murders is that the area is largely isolated and remote, with soft soil in many areas and carnivorous scavengers to carry away human remains; these factors precipitate violent attacks as perpetrators feel a sense of impunity, privacy (i.e. being outside the sight and earshot of the bystanders), and the ability to easily carry out their crimes and hide evidence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://britishcolumbia.com/things-to-do-and-see/wildlife-viewing/northern-bc-haida-gwaii/|title=Northern BC & Haida Gwaii|last=Lovegrove|first=Donald|date=2013-02-23|website=British Columbia Travel and Adventure Vacations|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-02}}</ref><ref name=\":28\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/esd/distdata/ecosystems/Soils_Reports/bc23_report.pdf|title=Soils of the Prince George, McLeod Lake area \u2013 MOE Technical Document 29|website=Ministry of Environment}}</ref>{{external media | width = 210px | float = right | video1 = [http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/bcs-infamous-highway-of-tears B.C.\u2018s infamous Highway of Tears], [[Canadian Broadcasting Company|CBC Archives]], 2:32, June 21, 2006, reported by Miyoung Lee<ref name=\"CBC\" />\n}}\n\n== Victims ==\nAccounts vary as to the exact number of victims.

Witnesses were under the age of 16 and were taken in to police custody where, after 3 hours of unsupervised interrogations, they were coerced by police to lie and say that Thomas was playing chicken with Redekop's truck (See [[Forensic developmental psychology#Susceptibility to suggestion|Forensic developmental psychology and Child Susceptibility to suggestion]]). Coroner Eric Turner was satisfied that the death happened by accident, but he later retracted his testimony after it was made public that he was let off with a lesser charge after the drunken hit-and-run death of an Indigenous man which he was responsible for 10 years earlier. Eric Turner also presided over an inquest two years before in the death of Larry Thomas, who was killed by a vehicle operated by Redekop's younger brother Stanley Redekop on the same road where Coreen was killed.

Another factor leading to abductions and murders is that the area is largely isolated and remote, with soft soil in many areas and carnivorous scavengers to carry away human remains; these factors precipitate violent attacks as perpetrators feel a sense of impunity, privacy (i.e. being outside the sight and earshot of the bystanders), and the ability to easily carry out their crimes and hide evidence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://britishcolumbia.com/things-to-do-and-see/wildlife-viewing/northern-bc-haida-gwaii/|title=Northern BC & Haida Gwaii|last=Lovegrove|first=Donald|date=2013-02-23|website=British Columbia Travel and Adventure Vacations|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-02}}</ref><ref name=\":28\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/esd/distdata/ecosystems/Soils_Reports/bc23_report.pdf|title=Soils of the Prince George, McLeod Lake area \u2013 MOE Technical Document 29|website=Ministry of Environment}}</ref>{{external media | width = 210px | float = right | video1 = [http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/bcs-infamous-highway-of-tears B.C.\u2018s infamous Highway of Tears], [[Canadian Broadcasting Company|CBC Archives]], 2:32, June 21, 2006, reported by Miyoung Lee<ref name=\"CBC\" />\n}}\n\n== Victims ==\nAccounts vary as to the exact number of victims.

Witnesses were under the age of 16 and were taken in to police custody where, after 3 hours of unsupervised interrogations, they were coerced by police to lie and say that Thomas was playing chicken with Redekop's truck (See [[Forensic developmental psychology#Susceptibility to suggestion|Forensic developmental psychology and Child Susceptibility to suggestion]]). Coroner Eric Turner was satisfied that the death happened by accident, but he later retracted his testimony after it was made public that he was let off with a lesser charge after the drunken hit-and-run death of an Indigenous man which he was responsible for 10 years earlier. Eric Turner also presided over an inquest two years before in the death of Larry Thomas, who was killed by a vehicle operated by Redekop's younger brother Stanley Redekop on the same road where Coreen was killed.

When they arrived, the building was engulfed in flames. Four people died in the blaze, including infant Kimberly Dumais (granddaughter), Helga Rochon (grandmother), Sherri Rochon (daughter) and Pauline Rochon (daughter). At the time, Helga was hosting her daughters and granddaughter in her third floor apartment for an overnight visit. Law enforcement determined that the blaze was set deliberately.

She was last seen after the house party, heading to a cabin in the Leo Creek area, north of Tachie.

They had been drinking and were going to pickup tin. When the truck got stuck after an accident, she separated from the two and headed for the cabin alone. This is what was told to the police by Keith and Victor. Mackie would usually call her sisters every day at 10 am. Her sister, Chrystal became alarmed after a few days of not receiving a call. Mackie was reported missing to the RCMP Monday June 17, 2013 by Chrystal. The RCMP came to Fort St James to file a missing persons report on June 18, 2013. Mackie didn't bring an extra set of clothes or makeup, which she changed daily, and her family considers her disappearance to be out of character.

The first three series were broadcast only on [[BBC One Scotland]], though five episodes selected from the first two series were later broadcast throughout the UK on [[BBC Two]] from January to February 2004. From the fourth series, ''Still Game'' was broadcast across the UK on [[BBC Two]]. With the seventh series in 2016, the programme began to be broadcast on [[BBC One]].\n\nIt was announced on 13 July 2018 that a ninth and final series would be produced later in the year which would see the characters go into \"comedy retirement\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BBCScotComms/status/1017544383200153600|title=We're raising a glass, with a tear in our eyes \u2013 it's last orders for #StillGame.

Due to a broken lift, the three men are stranded in Victor's flat and discuss a variety of subjects ranging from death to sex. The stage play toured Scotland, England, Ireland and Canada before returning to Glasgow, where the show was filmed at the Cottiers Theatre in 1999 and released on video on 22 November 1999. A DVD of the show was later released on 2 December 2002\n\nA small number of revisions accompanied ''Still Game'''s transition from stage to television. [[Gavin Mitchell (actor)|Gavin Mitchell]], who originally played Winston (and was replaced by Paul Riley for later performances), played the part of Boabby in the series. Characters mentioned in passing were later fleshed out into supporting characters.\n\nIn 1998, Jack and Victor appeared in a number of skits in a tongue-in-cheek documentary about Scottish [[pop music]] called ''Och Around the Clock''. In these, they are shown to be watching while sitting in Victor's flat. Their skits centred on the duo's disparaging comments about the performers.\n\nThe characters reappeared in Kiernan and Hemphill's sketch show ''[[Chewin' the Fat]]'', nearly every episode of which featured Jack, Victor, Tam and Winston, with minor differences from their counterparts in the series. By the time ''Still Game'' became a show in its own right Winston's physical appearance had changed significantly, but he was still played by [[Paul Riley (actor)|Paul Riley]]. As the show evolved, supporting characters assumed greater prominence. Jack and Victor made their final appearance on ''Chewin' the Fat'' in the 2002 Hogmanay Special.\n\nFor the show's first three series, the broadcast of ''Still Game'' was limited to BBC One Scotland. The show was then moved to BBC Two for the fourth series and shown throughout the UK. On 28 December 2005, the first Christmas special was shown on BBC One, the first national broadcast of the show on the channel. A fifth series of the show started filming in February 2006 and was shown the following June on BBC Two. As of 2006, series three had not been shown nationally, and only five episodes from the first two series were shown on national BBC Two from 17 January to 14 February 2004. The second series was shown nationally from 10 July 2008. This meant it was listed as a new series in TV listings, even though it was not for Scottish viewers.\n\nIn the first three series, the episode titles were all Glaswegian dialect words that were related to the episode. Starting from series four, the episodes were titled using standard English, so that general audiences could understand them.\n\nThe events of ''Still Game'' take place in a [[floating timeline]] where the characters remain the same age from series to series. One of the most prominent examples of this is that Victor reveals that he is 74 years old in \"Scran\", an episode of the second series, but it is not until the fifth series (\"Smoke On The Water\") that he celebrates his 75th birthday.\n\nThe sixth series of ''Still Game'' ended on BBC Two on 23 August 2007. A [[Christmas television special|Christmas special]] was aired on BBC One Scotland on 23 December and for the rest of the UK on BBC Two on 28 December. There was also a Hogmanay special called \"Hootenanny\" aired on BBC One Scotland, later aired to the rest of the UK on 2 January 2008.\n\nFord Kiernan, Greg Hemphill and Paul Riley's company [[Effingee Productions]] is thought to have split up after Riley walked away to go it alone after being refused more control over the future of the company by Kiernan. Hemphill stated that he didn't want a \"boardroom battle\".<ref name=eveningtimes4>{{cite web | title=Evening Times | work=It\u2019s game over for Scots comedy duo | url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/display.var.2447240.0.0.php?act=complaint&cid=1901999 | accessdate=16 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn 15 October 2013, the [[Daily Record (Scotland)|''Daily Record'']] ran a front-page story that the show would be returning. On 23 October 2013, Ford Kiernan and Greg Hemphill announced details of live shows entitled '' Still Game Live'' at [[The SSE Hydro]] in Glasgow at a press conference.

The sketch also featured a cameo of a director played by Still Game director Michael Hines. On [[Hogmanay]] 2014, BBC Scotland showed a documentary celebrating the show titled ''Still Game: The Story So Far''. The programme featured interviews with the cast, celebrities who have appeared on the show and super fans, including a look at some favourite moments.\n\nOn 12 May 2016, the [[BBC]] announced that the show would return in 2016 with a six-part seventh series, nine years after the previous series concluded. Filming of the new seventh series started in the summer and the series began on 7 October 2016.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-36275062 BBC comedy ''Still Game'' to return for new series]</ref> The show's return attracted its highest ever overnight audience for a single episode on 7 October, taking a 58% share of the Scottish TV audience with 1,300,000 viewers.

The early part of the first episode \"Flittin\" was filmed in the South Nitshill area of Glasgow, where Jack lived before he moved into the flat next-door to Victor at Osprey Heights. The block of flats which was used to film Osprey Heights can be found at Collina Street in the [[Maryhill]] area of Glasgow. The shops featured in the series can be found in the [[Townhead]] area of Glasgow. The [[Forth and Clyde Canal]] and its locks are used in background shots, along with the nearby high-rise tower blocks (flats) including the one used for Osprey Heights. For the first three series of the show, a pub (\"The Gimlet\") in [[Ruchill]] served as the set exterior of Jenny's pub, originally \"The Clansman\". Between series three and four, the building owner had it demolished. A reproduction exterior set was constructed by the production team in the Glasgow North Media Park, Maryhill for filming starting with the fourth series. An outdoor market in [[Possilpark]] was used in the episode \"Cauld\" when Winston buys several electric heaters. The bingo scene in \"Courtin\" was filmed at the [[Gala Bingo]] hall in Possilpark and was a scene that coincidentally brought two old friends together, as Paul Riley (Winston) and Joe Houston (the Gala Bingo caller featured in filming); were friends in their youth. Scene interiors (Jack and Victor's flats, hallways and the interior of Harrid's) were constructed sets in a warehouse of a complex now a Maryhill industrial estate and part of Craigmont Studios). Scenes from several episodes were also filmed in the [[Knightswood]] area of Glasgow, including exterior scenes in the episode \"Courtin\", and the golf course scenes in the episode \"Tappin\".\n\nFinport, as mentioned and seen in the fifth series, was filmed on location in [[Largs]] and [[Saltcoats]], [[North Ayrshire]], both of which were once popular seaside resorts with Glaswegians. The shots of the promenade and the sea wall is that of Saltcoats' harbour area. The caf\u00e9 that Jack and Victor walk past is The Melbourne Caf\u00e9 in Saltcoats. The pub scene is set in the Royal Oak pub in Largs, while the [[bed and breakfast]] where Jack and Victor stay overnight is located at the north end of Largs promenade. In the scene where Jack and Victor arrive on the bus from the right in Finport, this leads from the sea, as there is no road there. In the scene where Jack and Victor find Winston, a wide panning shot reveals the famous Nardini's ice-cream building and the [[Caledonian MacBrayne]] ferry to [[Millport, Isle of Cumbrae|Millport]].\n\n[[Ardgowan House]], a late eighteenth-century mansion at [[Inverkip]], [[Inverclyde]], was used as the setting for Blairtunnoch in the episode \"Fly Society\". Jack and Victor buy tickets for a meal and evening at the theatre from Tam who won them in a radio quiz. During the pre-theatre meal, they meet two apparently sophisticated, attractive ladies, played by [[Una McLean]] and [[Jeannie Fisher]], whom they try to impress with tall tales of overseas adventures and wealth: the women thus invite them to a country house party at Blairtunnoch.\n\nThe area where Jack and Victor are sitting during the court recess in the episode \"Recipe\" of series six is the Main Lounge of The Crookston Hotel in Glasgow. The interior shots of the bakery in the same episode \"Recipe\" were filmed at factories in Glasgow, one of which [[Tunnocks]] factory in [[Uddingston]] (the baker at the start of this episode is also the Tunnocks baker in Uddingston) and also Pars Foods for the production line scene with Winston.The court scenes were filmed in Court No. 2 of Hamilton Sheriff Court.\n\nThe bar used during the [[Still Game#Hogmanay Special .282007.29|Hogmanay Special in 2007, Hootenanny]], was The Red Hoose in [[Dunipace]], chosen by producers for its old world qualities.\n\nNavid's shop interior was a set in Hillington industrial estate, the exterior shots being a row of shops in Kennedy Path, Townhead, Glasgow.\n\nThe shots where Jack and Victor visit Barbara at her workplace were filmed in [[Clydebank]], a town 8 miles west of Glasgow. The interior of the shop was also filmed on site in a local charity shop which is still in use today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clyde-shoppingcentre.co.uk/map/storemap.aspx?UnitNo=SWS27&Shopcategory=Miscellaneous|title=Clyde Shopping Centre map|website=www.clyde-shoppingcentre.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nJust before the fifth series started filming, a pest control team had to be called into the Maryhill studio set when it was discovered that rats had infested Navid's shop and were eating their way through the stock. The alarm was raised after [[Jane McCarry]] (Isa) found a dead rat on the set. The high rat population in the area was due to the proximity of the [[Forth and Clyde Canal]].<ref name=\"daily record3\">{{cite web | title=Daily Record | work=A FORD IN THE RIVER | url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16708129&method=full&siteid=66633&headline=a-ford-in-the-river--name_page.html/ | accessdate=4 August 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Children In Need]] sketch was filmed on the [[River City|River City set]] at the [[BBC Scotland|BBC Scotland studios]] in [[Dumbarton, Scotland]], as was much of the seventh series.\n\nThe theme music used on the TV broadcasts of the show is an excerpt from \"Cuban Boy\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cubanboys.bandcamp.com/track/cuban-boy-cuban-boys-go-boom-mix|title=Cuban Boy (Cuban Boys Go Boom mix), by Cuban Boys|website=Cuban Boys}}</ref> as recorded by The Cuban Boys, which is itself based on a sample of [[Frank Chacksfield]]'s track of the same name from the album ''West of Sunset''. The opening and ending theme tune was changed to an entirely different theme on the BBC DVD releases: the reason behind this is still unexplained, however licensing could be a possibility. The [[BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra]] recorded an updated version of the theme tune for Series 7, which is also used on the DVD release of that series.\n\n==Awards==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It was created by [[Ford Kiernan]] and [[Greg Hemphill]], who played the lead characters, [[Jack Jarvis (Still Game character)|Jack Jarvis]] and [[Victor McDade]], two [[Glasgow|Glaswegian]] [[pensioner]]s. The characters first appeared in the pair's previous TV sketch show ''[[Chewin' the Fat]]'', which aired in Scotland from January 1999 until December 2005.\n\nFollowing its debut on 6 September 2002, [[List of Still Game episodes|62 episodes]] of ''Still Game'' were aired, including Christmas and [[Hogmanay]] specials. The first three series were broadcast only on [[BBC One Scotland]], though five episodes selected from the first two series were later broadcast throughout the UK on [[BBC Two]] from January to February 2004. From the fourth series, ''Still Game'' was broadcast across the UK on [[BBC Two]]. With the seventh series in 2016, the programme began to be broadcast on [[BBC One]].\n\nIt was announced on 13 July 2018 that a ninth and final series would be produced later in the year which would see the characters go into \"comedy retirement\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BBCScotComms/status/1017544383200153600|title=We're raising a glass, with a tear in our eyes \u2013 it's last orders for #StillGame.

Due to a broken lift, the three men are stranded in Victor's flat and discuss a variety of subjects ranging from death to sex. The stage play toured Scotland, England, Ireland and Canada before returning to Glasgow, where the show was filmed at the Cottiers Theatre in 1999 and released on video on 22 November 1999. A DVD of the show was later released on 2 December 2002\n\nA small number of revisions accompanied ''Still Game'''s transition from stage to television. [[Gavin Mitchell (actor)|Gavin Mitchell]], who originally played Winston (and was replaced by Paul Riley for later performances), played the part of Boabby in the series. Characters mentioned in passing were later fleshed out into supporting characters.\n\nIn 1998, Jack and Victor appeared in a number of skits in a tongue-in-cheek documentary about Scottish [[pop music]] called ''Och Around the Clock''. In these, they are shown to be watching while sitting in Victor's flat. Their skits centred on the duo's disparaging comments about the performers.\n\nThe characters reappeared in Kiernan and Hemphill's sketch show ''[[Chewin' the Fat]]'', nearly every episode of which featured Jack, Victor, Tam and Winston, with minor differences from their counterparts in the series. By the time ''Still Game'' became a show in its own right Winston's physical appearance had changed significantly, but he was still played by [[Paul Riley (actor)|Paul Riley]]. As the show evolved, supporting characters assumed greater prominence. Jack and Victor made their final appearance on ''Chewin' the Fat'' in the 2002 Hogmanay Special.\n\nFor the show's first three series, the broadcast of ''Still Game'' was limited to BBC One Scotland. The show was then moved to BBC Two for the fourth series and shown throughout the UK. On 28 December 2005, the first Christmas special was shown on BBC One, the first national broadcast of the show on the channel. A fifth series of the show started filming in February 2006 and was shown the following June on BBC Two. As of 2006, series three had not been shown nationally, and only five episodes from the first two series were shown on national BBC Two from 17 January to 14 February 2004. The second series was shown nationally from 10 July 2008. This meant it was listed as a new series in TV listings, even though it was not for Scottish viewers.\n\nIn the first three series, the episode titles were all Glaswegian dialect words that were related to the episode. Starting from series four, the episodes were titled using standard English, so that general audiences could understand them.\n\nThe events of ''Still Game'' take place in a [[floating timeline]] where the characters remain the same age from series to series. One of the most prominent examples of this is that Victor reveals that he is 74 years old in \"Scran\", an episode of the second series, but it is not until the fifth series (\"Smoke On The Water\") that he celebrates his 75th birthday.\n\nThe sixth series of ''Still Game'' ended on BBC Two on 23 August 2007. A [[Christmas television special|Christmas special]] was aired on BBC One Scotland on 23 December and for the rest of the UK on BBC Two on 28 December. There was also a Hogmanay special called \"Hootenanny\" aired on BBC One Scotland, later aired to the rest of the UK on 2 January 2008.\n\nFord Kiernan, Greg Hemphill and Paul Riley's company [[Effingee Productions]] is thought to have split up after Riley walked away to go it alone after being refused more control over the future of the company by Kiernan. Hemphill stated that he didn't want a \"boardroom battle\".<ref name=eveningtimes4>{{cite web | title=Evening Times | work=It\u2019s game over for Scots comedy duo | url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/display.var.2447240.0.0.php?act=complaint&cid=1901999 | accessdate=16 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn 15 October 2013, the [[Daily Record (Scotland)|''Daily Record'']] ran a front-page story that the show would be returning. On 23 October 2013, Ford Kiernan and Greg Hemphill announced details of live shows entitled '' Still Game Live'' at [[The SSE Hydro]] in Glasgow at a press conference. They were scheduled to perform four shows beginning in September 2014, but due to high demand, it was extended to 16 and then 21 shows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/entertainment/theatre/five-more-dates-added-for-still-games-hydro-show.1385548830|title=Five more dates added for Still Game's Hydro show|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe 21 shows at The Hydro ran from 19 September 2014 until 10 October 2014, played to 210,000 fans and made \u00a36,000,000 in ticket sales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/still-game-pulls-6million-21-4417745|title=Still Game pulls in \u00a36million from 21 sell-out shows|first=John|last=Dingwall|date=11 October 2014|publisher=}}</ref> The show received mixed reviews.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bigissue.com/reviews/live-reviews/4356/still-game-review| work=The Big Issue| title=STILL GAME \u2013 REVIEW| accessdate=6 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2014, a special sketch featuring Jack and Victor visiting the set of ''[[River City]]'' was made for [[Children in Need]]. The sketch also featured a cameo of a director played by Still Game director Michael Hines. On [[Hogmanay]] 2014, BBC Scotland showed a documentary celebrating the show titled ''Still Game: The Story So Far''. The programme featured interviews with the cast, celebrities who have appeared on the show and super fans, including a look at some favourite moments.\n\nOn 12 May 2016, the [[BBC]] announced that the show would return in 2016 with a six-part seventh series, nine years after the previous series concluded.

The early part of the first episode \"Flittin\" was filmed in the South Nitshill area of Glasgow, where Jack lived before he moved into the flat next-door to Victor at Osprey Heights. The block of flats which was used to film Osprey Heights can be found at Collina Street in the [[Maryhill]] area of Glasgow. The shops featured in the series can be found in the [[Townhead]] area of Glasgow. The [[Forth and Clyde Canal]] and its locks are used in background shots, along with the nearby high-rise tower blocks (flats) including the one used for Osprey Heights. For the first three series of the show, a pub (\"The Gimlet\") in [[Ruchill]] served as the set exterior of Jenny's pub, originally \"The Clansman\". Between series three and four, the building owner had it demolished. A reproduction exterior set was constructed by the production team in the Glasgow North Media Park, Maryhill for filming starting with the fourth series. An outdoor market in [[Possilpark]] was used in the episode \"Cauld\" when Winston buys several electric heaters. The bingo scene in \"Courtin\" was filmed at the [[Gala Bingo]] hall in Possilpark and was a scene that coincidentally brought two old friends together, as Paul Riley (Winston) and Joe Houston (the Gala Bingo caller featured in filming); were friends in their youth. Scene interiors (Jack and Victor's flats, hallways and the interior of Harrid's) were constructed sets in a warehouse of a complex now a Maryhill industrial estate and part of Craigmont Studios). Scenes from several episodes were also filmed in the [[Knightswood]] area of Glasgow, including exterior scenes in the episode \"Courtin\", and the golf course scenes in the episode \"Tappin\".\n\nFinport, as mentioned and seen in the fifth series, was filmed on location in [[Largs]] and [[Saltcoats]], [[North Ayrshire]], both of which were once popular seaside resorts with Glaswegians. The shots of the promenade and the sea wall is that of Saltcoats' harbour area. The caf\u00e9 that Jack and Victor walk past is The Melbourne Caf\u00e9 in Saltcoats. The pub scene is set in the Royal Oak pub in Largs, while the [[bed and breakfast]] where Jack and Victor stay overnight is located at the north end of Largs promenade. In the scene where Jack and Victor arrive on the bus from the right in Finport, this leads from the sea, as there is no road there. In the scene where Jack and Victor find Winston, a wide panning shot reveals the famous Nardini's ice-cream building and the [[Caledonian MacBrayne]] ferry to [[Millport, Isle of Cumbrae|Millport]].\n\n[[Ardgowan House]], a late eighteenth-century mansion at [[Inverkip]], [[Inverclyde]], was used as the setting for Blairtunnoch in the episode \"Fly Society\". Jack and Victor buy tickets for a meal and evening at the theatre from Tam who won them in a radio quiz. During the pre-theatre meal, they meet two apparently sophisticated, attractive ladies, played by [[Una McLean]] and [[Jeannie Fisher]], whom they try to impress with tall tales of overseas adventures and wealth: the women thus invite them to a country house party at Blairtunnoch.\n\nThe area where Jack and Victor are sitting during the court recess in the episode \"Recipe\" of series six is the Main Lounge of The Crookston Hotel in Glasgow. The interior shots of the bakery in the same episode \"Recipe\" were filmed at factories in Glasgow, one of which [[Tunnocks]] factory in [[Uddingston]] (the baker at the start of this episode is also the Tunnocks baker in Uddingston) and also Pars Foods for the production line scene with Winston.The court scenes were filmed in Court No. 2 of Hamilton Sheriff Court.\n\nThe bar used during the [[Still Game#Hogmanay Special .282007.29|Hogmanay Special in 2007, Hootenanny]], was The Red Hoose in [[Dunipace]], chosen by producers for its old world qualities.\n\nNavid's shop interior was a set in Hillington industrial estate, the exterior shots being a row of shops in Kennedy Path, Townhead, Glasgow.\n\nThe shots where Jack and Victor visit Barbara at her workplace were filmed in [[Clydebank]], a town 8 miles west of Glasgow. The interior of the shop was also filmed on site in a local charity shop which is still in use today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clyde-shoppingcentre.co.uk/map/storemap.aspx?UnitNo=SWS27&Shopcategory=Miscellaneous|title=Clyde Shopping Centre map|website=www.clyde-shoppingcentre.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nJust before the fifth series started filming, a pest control team had to be called into the Maryhill studio set when it was discovered that rats had infested Navid's shop and were eating their way through the stock. The alarm was raised after [[Jane McCarry]] (Isa) found a dead rat on the set. The high rat population in the area was due to the proximity of the [[Forth and Clyde Canal]].<ref name=\"daily record3\">{{cite web | title=Daily Record | work=A FORD IN THE RIVER | url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16708129&method=full&siteid=66633&headline=a-ford-in-the-river--name_page.html/ | accessdate=4 August 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Children In Need]] sketch was filmed on the [[River City|River City set]] at the [[BBC Scotland|BBC Scotland studios]] in [[Dumbarton, Scotland]], as was much of the seventh series.\n\nThe theme music used on the TV broadcasts of the show is an excerpt from \"Cuban Boy\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cubanboys.bandcamp.com/track/cuban-boy-cuban-boys-go-boom-mix|title=Cuban Boy (Cuban Boys Go Boom mix), by Cuban Boys|website=Cuban Boys}}</ref> as recorded by The Cuban Boys, which is itself based on a sample of [[Frank Chacksfield]]'s track of the same name from the album ''West of Sunset''. The opening and ending theme tune was changed to an entirely different theme on the BBC DVD releases: the reason behind this is still unexplained, however licensing could be a possibility. The [[BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra]] recorded an updated version of the theme tune for Series 7, which is also used on the DVD release of that series.\n\n==Awards==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In the late 1990s, the northern Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex suburban development tide hit the northern border of [[Plano, Texas|Plano]] and spilled into Frisco, sparking rapid growth into the 2000s. Like many of the cities in the northern suburbs of [[Dallas]], Frisco serves as a [[bedroom community]] for professionals who work in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.\n\nSince 2003, Frisco has received the designation [[Tree City USA]] by the [[National Arbor Day Foundation]].\n\n==History==\nWhen the Dallas area was being settled by American pioneers, many of the [[settler]]s traveled by [[wagon train]]s along the [[Texas Road|Shawnee Trail]]. This trail became the [[Preston Trail]], and later, [[Texas State Highway 289|Preston Road]]. With all of this activity, the community of [[Lebanon, Texas|Lebanon]] was founded along this trail, and was granted a U.S. post office in 1860. In 1902, a line of the [[St. Louis-San Francisco Railway]] was being built through the area, and periodic watering stops were needed along the route for the steam locomotives. The current settlement of Lebanon was on the Preston Ridge and was therefore too high in elevation, so the watering stop was placed about four miles (6&nbsp;km) to the west on lower ground. A community grew around this train stop. Some residents of [[Lebanon, Texas|Lebanon]] actually moved their houses to the new community on logs. The new town was originally named Emerson, but the [[U.S. Postal Service]] rejected the name as being too similar to another town in Texas. In 1904, the town's residents chose \"Frisco City\" in honor of the St. Louis\u2013San Francisco Railway. This name was later shortened to Frisco.\n\nLater, in 1978, the first season of the hit show ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' was filmed at Frisco's [[Cloyce Box Ranch]] (now the Brinkmann Ranch), where the house on site was used as the Ewing family home.

In the late 1990s, the northern Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex suburban development tide hit the northern border of [[Plano, Texas|Plano]] and spilled into Frisco, sparking rapid growth into the 2000s. Like many of the cities in the northern suburbs of [[Dallas]], Frisco serves as a [[bedroom community]] for professionals who work in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.\n\nSince 2003, Frisco has received the designation [[Tree City USA]] by the [[National Arbor Day Foundation]].\n\n==History==\nWhen the Dallas area was being settled by American pioneers, many of the [[settler]]s traveled by [[wagon train]]s along the [[Texas Road|Shawnee Trail]]. This trail became the [[Preston Trail]], and later, [[Texas State Highway 289|Preston Road]]. With all of this activity, the community of [[Lebanon, Texas|Lebanon]] was founded along this trail, and was granted a U.S. post office in 1860. In 1902, a line of the [[St. Louis-San Francisco Railway]] was being built through the area, and periodic watering stops were needed along the route for the steam locomotives. The current settlement of Lebanon was on the Preston Ridge and was therefore too high in elevation, so the watering stop was placed about four miles (6&nbsp;km) to the west on lower ground. A community grew around this train stop. Some residents of [[Lebanon, Texas|Lebanon]] actually moved their houses to the new community on logs. The new town was originally named Emerson, but the [[U.S. Postal Service]] rejected the name as being too similar to another town in Texas. In 1904, the town's residents chose \"Frisco City\" in honor of the St. Louis\u2013San Francisco Railway. This name was later shortened to Frisco.\n\nLater, in 1978, the first season of the hit show ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' was filmed at Frisco's [[Cloyce Box Ranch]] (now the Brinkmann Ranch), where the house on site was used as the Ewing family home. This house burned down during renovations in 1987, and the steel skeleton of the house still stands on today's Brinkmann Ranch, now the largest family owned estate in Frisco.\n\nThe distinctive Frisco coat of arms is based on the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway's logo.\n\n==Geography==\nFrisco is in western Collin County and eastern Denton County at {{Coord|33.141263|-96.813120|type:city_region:US|format=dms|display=inline}} (33.141263, -96.813120).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020527061848/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|archive-date=May 27, 2002|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{Geographic location\n|Centre    = Frisco\n|Northwest = [[Savannah, Texas|Savannah]]\n|North     = [[Prosper, Texas|Prosper]]\n|Northeast = [[McKinney, Texas|McKinney]]\n|West      = [[Little Elm, Texas|Little Elm]]\n|East      = [[McKinney, Texas|McKinney]]\n|Southwest = [[The Colony, Texas|The Colony]]\n|South     = [[Plano, Texas|Plano]]\n|Southeast = [[Allen, Texas|Allen]]\n}}\n\n===Climate===\nFrisco is part of the [[humid subtropical]] region.

Other characteristics of a star, including diameter and temperature, change over its life, while the star's environment affects its rotation and movement. A plot of the temperature of many stars against their luminosities produces a plot known as a [[Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram]] (H\u2013R diagram). Plotting a particular star on that diagram allows the age and evolutionary state of that star to be determined.\n\nA star's life [[star formation|begins]] with the [[gravitational collapse]] of a gaseous [[nebula]] of material composed primarily of hydrogen, along with helium and trace amounts of heavier elements.

However, stars of different masses have markedly different properties at various stages of their development. The ultimate fate of more massive stars differs from that of less massive stars, as do their luminosities and the impact they have on their environment.

The Sun is expected to live 10 billion (10<sup>10</sup>) years. Massive stars consume their fuel very rapidly and are short-lived. Low mass stars consume their fuel very slowly. Stars less massive than 0.25 {{Solar mass}}, called [[red dwarf]]s, are able to fuse nearly all of their mass while stars of about 1 {{Solar mass}} can only fuse about 10% of their mass.

In a red giant of up to 2.25 {{Solar mass}}, the mass of the helium core becomes degenerate prior to [[helium fusion]]. Finally, when the temperature increases sufficiently, helium fusion begins explosively in what is called a [[helium flash]], and the star rapidly shrinks in radius, increases its surface temperature, and moves to the [[horizontal branch]] of the HR diagram. For more massive stars, helium core fusion starts before the core becomes degenerate, and the star spends some time in the [[red clump]], slowly burning helium, before the outer convective envelope collapses and the star then moves to the horizontal branch.<ref name=\"iben\"/>\n\nAfter the star has fused the helium of its core, the carbon product fuses producing a hot core with an outer shell of fusing helium. The star then follows an evolutionary path called the [[asymptotic giant branch]] (AGB) that parallels the other described red giant phase, but with a higher luminosity. The more massive AGB stars may undergo a brief period of carbon fusion before the core becomes degenerate.\n\n====Massive stars====\n{{Main|Supergiant star|Hypergiant|Wolf\u2013Rayet star}}\nDuring their helium-burning phase, a star of more than 9 solar masses expands to form first a [[blue supergiant|blue]] and then a [[red supergiant]]. Particularly massive stars may evolve to a [[Wolf-Rayet star]], characterised by spectra dominated by emission lines of elements heavier than hydrogen, which have reached the surface due to strong convection and intense mass loss.\n\nWhen helium is exhausted at the core of a massive star, the core contracts and the temperature and pressure rises enough to fuse [[carbon]] (see [[Carbon-burning process]]). This process continues, with the successive stages being fueled by [[neon]] (see [[neon-burning process]]), [[oxygen]] (see [[oxygen-burning process]]), and [[silicon]] (see [[silicon-burning process]]). Near the end of the star's life, fusion continues along a series of onion-layer shells within a massive star. Each shell fuses a different element, with the outermost shell fusing hydrogen; the next shell fusing helium, and so forth.<ref>\n{{cite web |url= https://www.e-education.psu.edu/astro801/content/l6_p5.html |title=The Evolution of Massive Stars and Type II Supernovae |publisher=Penn Stats College of Science |accessdate= 2016-01-05}}\n</ref>\n\nThe final stage occurs when a massive star begins producing [[iron]]. Since iron nuclei are more [[binding energy|tightly bound]] than any heavier nuclei, any fusion beyond iron does not produce a net release of energy. To a very limited degree such a process proceeds, but it consumes energy. Likewise, since they are more tightly bound than all lighter nuclei, such energy cannot be released by [[Nuclear fission|fission]].<ref name=\"sneden\">{{Cite journal |title= Astronomy: The age of the Universe |journal= Nature |date= February 8, 2001  |pages= 673\u2013675 |volume= 409 |issue= 6821 |doi= 10.1038/35055646 |pmid= 11217843 |first= Christopher |last= Sneden}}</ref>\n\n====Collapse====\nAs a star's core shrinks, the intensity of radiation from that surface increases, creating such [[radiation pressure]] on the outer shell of gas that it will push those layers away, forming a [[planetary nebula]].

The components of motion of a star consist of the [[radial velocity]] toward or away from the Sun, and the traverse angular movement, which is called its [[proper motion]].\n\nRadial velocity is measured by the [[doppler shift]] of the star's spectral lines, and is given in units of km/[[second|s]]. The proper motion of a star, its [[parallax]], is determined by precise astrometric measurements in units of milli-[[arc second]]s (mas) per year. With knowledge of the star's parallax and its distance, the proper motion velocity can be calculated. Together with the radial velocity, the total velocity can be calculated. Stars with high rates of proper motion are likely to be relatively close to the Sun, making them good candidates for parallax measurements.<ref>{{cite web\n | date=September 10, 1999 | url=http://www.rssd.esa.int/index.php?project=HIPPARCOS\n | title=Hipparcos: High Proper Motion Stars\n | publisher=ESA | accessdate=2006-10-10}}</ref>\n\nWhen both rates of movement are known, the [[space velocity (astronomy)|space velocity]] of the star relative to the Sun or the galaxy can be computed.

The main classifications in order of decreasing surface temperature are: ''O, B, A, F, G, K'', and ''M''. A variety of rare spectral types are given special classifications. The most common of these are types ''L'' and ''T'', which classify the coldest low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.

The balanced forces are inward gravitational force and an outward force due to the pressure [[gradient]] within the star. The [[pressure gradient]] is established by the temperature gradient of the plasma; the outer part of the star is cooler than the core. The temperature at the core of a main sequence or giant star is at least on the order of 10<sup>7</sup> K.

These photons interact with the surrounding plasma, adding to the thermal energy at the core. Stars on the main sequence convert hydrogen into helium, creating a slowly but steadily increasing proportion of helium in the core. Eventually the helium content becomes predominant, and energy production ceases at the core. Instead, for stars of more than 0.4 {{Solar mass}}, fusion occurs in a slowly expanding shell around the [[degenerate matter|degenerate]] helium core.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://aether.lbl.gov/www/tour/elements/stellar/stellar_a.html |title= Formation of the High Mass Elements |publisher= Smoot Group |accessdate= 2006-07-11}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to hydrostatic equilibrium, the interior of a stable star will also maintain an energy balance of [[thermal equilibrium]]. There is a radial temperature gradient throughout the interior that results in a flux of energy flowing toward the exterior. The outgoing flux of energy leaving any layer within the star will exactly match the incoming flux from below.\n\nThe [[radiation zone]] is the region of the stellar interior where the flux of energy outward is dependent on radiative heat transfer, since convective heat transfer is inefficient in that zone. In this region the plasma will not be perturbed, and any mass motions will die out. If this is not the case, however, then the plasma becomes unstable and convection will occur, forming a [[convection zone]]. This can occur, for example, in regions where very high energy fluxes occur, such as near the core or in areas with high [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] (making radiatative heat transfer inefficient) as in the outer envelope.<ref name=\"Schwarzschild\" />\n\nThe occurrence of convection in the outer envelope of a main sequence star depends on the star's mass. Stars with several times the mass of the Sun have a convection zone deep within the interior and a radiative zone in the outer layers. Smaller stars such as the Sun are just the opposite, with the convective zone located in the outer layers.<ref name=\"imagine\">{{cite web |date= 2006-09-01 |url= http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l2/stars.html |title= What is a Star? |publisher= NASA |accessdate= 2006-07-11}}</ref> Red dwarf stars with less than 0.4 {{Solar mass}} are convective throughout, which prevents the accumulation of a helium core.<ref name=\"late stages\" /> For most stars the convective zones will also vary over time as the star ages and the constitution of the interior is modified.<ref name=\"Schwarzschild\" />\n\n[[File:Sun parts big.jpg|thumb|This diagram shows a cross-section of the [[Sun]].]]\nThe [[photosphere]] is that portion of a star that is visible to an observer.

It is within the photosphere that [[sun spots]], regions of lower than average temperature, appear.\n\nAbove the level of the photosphere is the [[stellar atmosphere]]. In a main sequence star such as the Sun, the lowest level of the atmosphere, just above the photosphere, is the thin [[chromosphere]] region, where [[spicule (solar physics)|spicules]] appear and [[solar flare|stellar flares]] begin.

The nearest star to [[Earth]] is the [[Sun]]. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of [[Fixed stars|fixed]] luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into [[constellation]]s and [[asterism (astronomy)|asterisms]], the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled [[star catalogue]]s that identify the known stars and provide standardized [[stellar designation]]s. The [[observable Universe]] contains an estimated {{val|1e24}} stars,<ref name=\"ESA-2019\">{{cite web |author=Staff |title=How Many Stars Are There In The Universe? |url=https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Herschel/How_many_stars_are_there_in_the_Universe |date=2019 |work=[[European Space Agency]] |accessdate=21 September 2019 }}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite book|chapter=The Structure of the Universe|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-8730-2_10|title=The Fundamentals of Modern Astrophysics|pages=279\u2013294|year=2015|last1=Marov|first1=Mikhail Ya.|isbn=978-1-4614-8729-6}}</ref> but most are invisible to the naked eye from Earth, including all stars outside our [[galaxy]], the [[Milky Way]].\n\nFor at least a portion of its life, a star shines due to [[thermonuclear fusion]] of [[hydrogen]] into [[helium]] in its core, releasing energy that traverses the star's interior and then [[radiation|radiates]] into [[outer space]]. Almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than helium are created by [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] during the star's lifetime, and for some stars by [[supernova nucleosynthesis]] when it explodes. Near the end of its life, a star can also contain [[degenerate matter]]. [[Astronomer]]s can determine the [[stellar mass|mass]], age, [[metallicity]] (chemical composition), and many other properties of a star by observing its motion through space, its [[luminosity]], and [[astronomical spectroscopy|spectrum]] respectively. The total mass of a star is the main factor that determines its [[stellar evolution|evolution]] and eventual fate. Other characteristics of a star, including diameter and temperature, change over its life, while the star's environment affects its rotation and movement. A plot of the temperature of many stars against their luminosities produces a plot known as a [[Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram]] (H\u2013R diagram). Plotting a particular star on that diagram allows the age and evolutionary state of that star to be determined.\n\nA star's life [[star formation|begins]] with the [[gravitational collapse]] of a gaseous [[nebula]] of material composed primarily of hydrogen, along with helium and trace amounts of heavier elements. When the stellar core is sufficiently dense, hydrogen becomes steadily converted into helium through nuclear fusion, releasing energy in the process.<ref name=\"sunshine\">{{cite web\n | last= Bahcall | first= John N.\n | date= June 29, 2000\n | url= http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/articles/fusion/index.html\n | title= How the Sun Shines | publisher= Nobel Foundation\n | accessdate= 2006-08-30}}</ref> The remainder of the star's interior carries energy away from the core through a combination of [[radiation|radiative]] and [[convection|convective]] [[heat transfer]] processes.

However, stars of different masses have markedly different properties at various stages of their development. The ultimate fate of more massive stars differs from that of less massive stars, as do their luminosities and the impact they have on their environment.

In a red giant of up to 2.25 {{Solar mass}}, the mass of the helium core becomes degenerate prior to [[helium fusion]]. Finally, when the temperature increases sufficiently, helium fusion begins explosively in what is called a [[helium flash]], and the star rapidly shrinks in radius, increases its surface temperature, and moves to the [[horizontal branch]] of the HR diagram. For more massive stars, helium core fusion starts before the core becomes degenerate, and the star spends some time in the [[red clump]], slowly burning helium, before the outer convective envelope collapses and the star then moves to the horizontal branch.<ref name=\"iben\"/>\n\nAfter the star has fused the helium of its core, the carbon product fuses producing a hot core with an outer shell of fusing helium. The star then follows an evolutionary path called the [[asymptotic giant branch]] (AGB) that parallels the other described red giant phase, but with a higher luminosity. The more massive AGB stars may undergo a brief period of carbon fusion before the core becomes degenerate.\n\n====Massive stars====\n{{Main|Supergiant star|Hypergiant|Wolf\u2013Rayet star}}\nDuring their helium-burning phase, a star of more than 9 solar masses expands to form first a [[blue supergiant|blue]] and then a [[red supergiant]]. Particularly massive stars may evolve to a [[Wolf-Rayet star]], characterised by spectra dominated by emission lines of elements heavier than hydrogen, which have reached the surface due to strong convection and intense mass loss.\n\nWhen helium is exhausted at the core of a massive star, the core contracts and the temperature and pressure rises enough to fuse [[carbon]] (see [[Carbon-burning process]]). This process continues, with the successive stages being fueled by [[neon]] (see [[neon-burning process]]), [[oxygen]] (see [[oxygen-burning process]]), and [[silicon]] (see [[silicon-burning process]]). Near the end of the star's life, fusion continues along a series of onion-layer shells within a massive star. Each shell fuses a different element, with the outermost shell fusing hydrogen; the next shell fusing helium, and so forth.<ref>\n{{cite web |url= https://www.e-education.psu.edu/astro801/content/l6_p5.html |title=The Evolution of Massive Stars and Type II Supernovae |publisher=Penn Stats College of Science |accessdate= 2016-01-05}}\n</ref>\n\nThe final stage occurs when a massive star begins producing [[iron]].

Of the intrinsically variable stars, the primary types can be subdivided into three principal groups.\n\nDuring their stellar evolution, some stars pass through phases where they can become pulsating variables. Pulsating variable stars vary in radius and luminosity over time, expanding and contracting with periods ranging from minutes to years, depending on the size of the star. This category includes [[Cepheid variable|Cepheid and Cepheid-like stars]], and long-period variables such as [[Mira variable|Mira]].<ref name=\"variables\">{{cite web |url=http://www.aavso.org/types-variables |title=Types of Variable |date=May 11, 2010 |publisher=AAVSO |accessdate=2010-08-20}}</ref>\n\nEruptive variables are stars that experience sudden increases in luminosity because of flares or mass ejection events.<ref name=\"variables\" /> This group includes protostars, Wolf-Rayet stars, and [[flare star]]s, as well as giant and supergiant stars.\n\nCataclysmic or explosive variable stars are those that undergo a dramatic change in their properties. This group includes [[nova]]e and supernovae. A binary star system that includes a nearby white dwarf can produce certain types of these spectacular stellar explosions, including the nova and a Type 1a supernova.<ref name=\"iben\" /> The explosion is created when the white dwarf accretes hydrogen from the companion star, building up mass until the hydrogen undergoes fusion.<ref>{{cite web\n | date =2004-11-01 | url= http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l2/cataclysmic_variables.html\n | title= Cataclysmic Variables\n | publisher= NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\n | accessdate= 2006-06-08}}</ref> Some novae are also recurrent, having periodic outbursts of moderate amplitude.<ref name=\"variables\" />\n\nStars can also vary in luminosity because of extrinsic factors, such as eclipsing binaries, as well as rotating stars that produce extreme starspots.<ref name=\"variables\" /> A notable example of an eclipsing binary is Algol, which regularly varies in magnitude from 2.1 to 3.4 over a period of 2.87 days.<ref name=gcvs>{{cite journal|bibcode=2009yCat....102025S|title=VizieR Online Data Catalog: General Catalogue of Variable Stars (Samus+ 2007-2013)|journal=VizieR On-line Data Catalog: B/GCVS.

The balanced forces are inward gravitational force and an outward force due to the pressure [[gradient]] within the star. The [[pressure gradient]] is established by the temperature gradient of the plasma; the outer part of the star is cooler than the core. The temperature at the core of a main sequence or giant star is at least on the order of 10<sup>7</sup> K. The resulting temperature and pressure at the hydrogen-burning core of a main sequence star are sufficient for [[nuclear fusion]] to occur and for sufficient energy to be produced to prevent further collapse of the star.<ref name=\"hansen\">{{cite book |last1=Hansen |first1=Carl J. |last2=Kawaler |first2=Steven D. |last3=Trimble |first3=Virginia |pages=[https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-1-4419-9110-2/page/n44 32]\u201333 |title=Stellar Interiors |url=https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-1-4419-9110-2 |publisher=Springer |date=2004 |isbn=978-0-387-20089-7}}</ref><ref name=\"Schwarzschild\">{{cite book|title=Structure and Evolution of the Stars|last=Schwarzschild|first=Martin|date=1958|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-08044-4}}<!-- Book republished by Dover as ISBN 0-486-61479-4, but ISBN in the cite book template is the one as published by Prin. Univ. Press--></ref>\n\nAs atomic nuclei are fused in the core, they emit energy in the form of [[gamma ray]]s. These photons interact with the surrounding plasma, adding to the thermal energy at the core. Stars on the main sequence convert hydrogen into helium, creating a slowly but steadily increasing proportion of helium in the core. Eventually the helium content becomes predominant, and energy production ceases at the core. Instead, for stars of more than 0.4 {{Solar mass}}, fusion occurs in a slowly expanding shell around the [[degenerate matter|degenerate]] helium core.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://aether.lbl.gov/www/tour/elements/stellar/stellar_a.html |title= Formation of the High Mass Elements |publisher= Smoot Group |accessdate= 2006-07-11}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to hydrostatic equilibrium, the interior of a stable star will also maintain an energy balance of [[thermal equilibrium]]. There is a radial temperature gradient throughout the interior that results in a flux of energy flowing toward the exterior. The outgoing flux of energy leaving any layer within the star will exactly match the incoming flux from below.\n\nThe [[radiation zone]] is the region of the stellar interior where the flux of energy outward is dependent on radiative heat transfer, since convective heat transfer is inefficient in that zone. In this region the plasma will not be perturbed, and any mass motions will die out. If this is not the case, however, then the plasma becomes unstable and convection will occur, forming a [[convection zone]]. This can occur, for example, in regions where very high energy fluxes occur, such as near the core or in areas with high [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] (making radiatative heat transfer inefficient) as in the outer envelope.<ref name=\"Schwarzschild\" />\n\nThe occurrence of convection in the outer envelope of a main sequence star depends on the star's mass. Stars with several times the mass of the Sun have a convection zone deep within the interior and a radiative zone in the outer layers. Smaller stars such as the Sun are just the opposite, with the convective zone located in the outer layers.<ref name=\"imagine\">{{cite web |date= 2006-09-01 |url= http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l2/stars.html |title= What is a Star? |publisher= NASA |accessdate= 2006-07-11}}</ref> Red dwarf stars with less than 0.4 {{Solar mass}} are convective throughout, which prevents the accumulation of a helium core.<ref name=\"late stages\" /> For most stars the convective zones will also vary over time as the star ages and the constitution of the interior is modified.<ref name=\"Schwarzschild\" />\n\n[[File:Sun parts big.jpg|thumb|This diagram shows a cross-section of the [[Sun]].]]\nThe [[photosphere]] is that portion of a star that is visible to an observer. This is the layer at which the plasma of the star becomes transparent to photons of light. From here, the energy generated at the core becomes free to propagate into space. It is within the photosphere that [[sun spots]], regions of lower than average temperature, appear.\n\nAbove the level of the photosphere is the [[stellar atmosphere]]. In a main sequence star such as the Sun, the lowest level of the atmosphere, just above the photosphere, is the thin [[chromosphere]] region, where [[spicule (solar physics)|spicules]] appear and [[solar flare|stellar flares]] begin. Above this is the transition region, where the temperature rapidly increases within a distance of only {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}}. Beyond this is the [[corona]], a volume of super-heated plasma that can extend outward to several million kilometres.<ref>{{cite press release\n | publisher= ESO | date= August 1, 2001\n | title= The Glory of a Nearby Star: Optical Light from a Hot Stellar Corona Detected with the VLT\n | url= http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0127/\n | accessdate= 2006-07-10}}</ref> The existence of a corona appears to be dependent on a convective zone in the outer layers of the star.<ref name= \"imagine\" /> Despite its high temperature, and the corona emits very little light, due to its low gas density.
