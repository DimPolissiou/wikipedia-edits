The Cocoa Panyols  are an Hispanic (Latino) ethnic mixture of mainly European (Spanish and/or French), Amerindian and African ancestry.  Because of French influence most of the villagers in Paramin speak/spoke [[Antillean Creole French|French Creole]] or Patois, in addition to English; French Creole or Patois was spoken by most residents in the 1960s.\n\nSome of the early settlers in the village of Paramin were runaway slaves from the Maraval (Negre Marron Caves) and Diego Martin Valleys (Camp Marron or Cameron).<ref>Trinidad Express http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/Paramin_keeping_patois_alive-126497818.html</ref>\n\n==Names of places within Paramin==\nWithin Paramin many locations have French names including Finette Road <ref>Island Hikers http://islandhikers.com/tt-trails/saut-deau-beach/</ref> Saut D'Eau, Morne Espoire, Morne Roche, Beau Pres, Morne Rene <ref>TTGeoViewhttp://tt.geoview.info/,4988754p</ref>\n\n==Music==\nThe area is also home to two specific music genres\u2014[[Cr\u00e8che (music)|Cr\u00e8che]] and [[Parang]] <ref>Trinidad Express http://www.trinidadexpress.com/sunday-mix/We-paranging--in-Paramin-234833971.html.</ref>  Both are specifically played at Christmas time.  They reflect the French and Spanish influences of the island mixed with Afro/Caribbean beats.  Parang has seen a large resurgence in recent years with mixes of both Soca and even Chutney music with lyrics in English.  The Maraval Folk Choir, known for both Cr\u00e8che and Parang, produced a Cr\u00e8che album in the 1970s, and the Paramin Folk Choir produced one in 2004.{{cn|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Catholicism==\nThe area is predominantly Roman Catholic with many of the residents being practicing Catholics.{{cn|date=August 2018}}  Within the village of Paramin are a Roman Catholic primary school and a Catholic church (Our Lady of Guadalupe) that serve the area. The churches within Paramin and Maraval are linked in their record keeping of the Sacraments.\n\n==Activity==\n\n===French Creole or Patois mass on Dimanche Gras===\nThe church still offers a well-known French Creole or Patois mass on Dimanche Gras, the Sunday before Carnival,<ref>Uncommon Caribbean http://www.uncommoncaribbean.com/2012/05 /08/on-site-trinidad-</ref> exploring the steep Paramin hills. Persons from areas outside of Maraval and Paramin, including foreign dignitaries of French origin and French Creole origin such as Louisiana attend the Mass either to experience the culture of the area or to participate in an activity that falls outside of the Carnival setting.\n\nMost of the Mass is said in Creole or Patois.

It is a sprawling, steep and mountainous village whose residents have traditionally been farmers, producing herbs like chives, thyme and parsley, as well as vegetables like tomatoes and yams.\n\n==Population==\n[[File:Botanical Gazette, 1885.pdf|Botanical Gazette, 1885|thumb|right|Botanist [[Augustus Fendler]] on his visit to the Maraval area]]\nMany of the original residents of the area are descendants of the [[Creole peoples#Caribbean|French Creole]] migrants to the island following the [[Cedula of Population]] (1783) <ref>Uncommon Caribbean http://www.uncommoncaribbean.com/2012/05/08/on-site-trinidad-exploring-the-steep-and-storied-paramin-hills/</ref> and the surnames reflect this heritage:  Constantine, Fournillier (Fournier), Isidore, Laurent (Lawrence), Pascal, Romany, etc.   Following the Cedula of Population, Paramin was peopled by French Creole immigrants from [[Martinique]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Grenada]] (La Grenade), [[Dominica]] (La Dominique), [[St. Lucia]] (Ste. Lucie), etc.<ref>TNT Island http://www.tntisland.com/patois.html</ref>\n\nParamin  was later also populated by Cocoa Panyols <ref>Trinidad Express http://www. trinidadexpress.com/news/Paramin_keeping_patois_alive-126497818.html</ref> from Venezuela in South America who aided in establishing the cocoa industry.  The Cocoa Panyols  are an Hispanic (Latino) ethnic mixture of mainly European (Spanish and/or French), Amerindian and African ancestry.  Because of French influence most of the villagers in Paramin speak/spoke [[Antillean Creole French|French Creole]] or Patois, in addition to English; French Creole or Patois was spoken by most residents in the 1960s.\n\nSome of the early settlers in the village of Paramin were runaway slaves from the Maraval (Negre Marron Caves) and Diego Martin Valleys (Camp Marron or Cameron).<ref>Trinidad Express http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/Paramin_keeping_patois_alive-126497818.html</ref>\n\n==Names of places within Paramin==\nWithin Paramin many locations have French names including Finette Road <ref>Island Hikers http://islandhikers.com/tt-trails/saut-deau-beach/</ref> Saut D'Eau, Morne Espoire, Morne Roche, Beau Pres, Morne Rene <ref>TTGeoViewhttp://tt.geoview.info/,4988754p</ref>\n\n==Music==\nThe area is also home to two specific music genres\u2014[[Cr\u00e8che (music)|Cr\u00e8che]] and [[Parang]] <ref>Trinidad Express http://www.trinidadexpress.com/sunday-mix/We-paranging--in-Paramin-234833971.html.</ref>  Both are specifically played at Christmas time.  They reflect the French and Spanish influences of the island mixed with Afro/Caribbean beats.  Parang has seen a large resurgence in recent years with mixes of both Soca and even Chutney music with lyrics in English.  The Maraval Folk Choir, known for both Cr\u00e8che and Parang, produced a Cr\u00e8che album in the 1970s, and the Paramin Folk Choir produced one in 2004.{{cn|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Catholicism==\nThe area is predominantly Roman Catholic with many of the residents being practicing Catholics.{{cn|date=August 2018}}  Within the village of Paramin are a Roman Catholic primary school and a Catholic church (Our Lady of Guadalupe) that serve the area. The churches within Paramin and Maraval are linked in their record keeping of the Sacraments.\n\n==Activity==\n\n===French Creole or Patois mass on Dimanche Gras===\nThe church still offers a well-known French Creole or Patois mass on Dimanche Gras, the Sunday before Carnival,<ref>Uncommon Caribbean http://www.uncommoncaribbean.com/2012/05 /08/on-site-trinidad-</ref> exploring the steep Paramin hills. Persons from areas outside of Maraval and Paramin, including foreign dignitaries of French origin and French Creole origin such as Louisiana attend the Mass either to experience the culture of the area or to participate in an activity that falls outside of the Carnival setting.\n\nMost of the Mass is said in Creole or Patois. There is a choir which leads the singing of the hymns at the Mass.\n\nMembers of the choir and the congregation at the Mass are  dressed in colorful plaids, in the style of La Reine Rive, which is a white cotton top and skirt, with an overskirt in plaid, which drapes to the sides of the front of the skirt and leaves the front of the white skirt visible.

[[London postal district|London postcode districts]] often have an influence over where a place is considered to be although they were not designed for that purpose. All London boroughs are divided into [[Ward (country subdivision)|ward]]s which often share the names of London districts, however, they rarely share the historic or commonly accepted contemporary boundaries of those places.\n\n===London boroughs===\n[[Greater London]] consists of the [[City of London]] and 32 [[London borough]]s, of which 12 are statutory [[Inner London]] boroughs and 20 are [[Outer London]] boroughs.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! class=\"unsortable\" |\n!

[[London postal district|London postcode districts]] often have an influence over where a place is considered to be although they were not designed for that purpose.

It is one of the [[British ensign]]s, and it is used either plain or [[defacement (flag)|defaced]] with a badge or other [[emblem]], mostly in the right half.\n\nIt is the flag flown by British merchant or passenger ships since 1707. Prior to 1707, an [[Kingdom of England|English]] red ensign and a [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish]] red ensign were flown by the English and Scottish Royal navies, respectively. The precise date of the first appearance of these earlier red ensigns is not known, but surviving payment receipts indicate that the English navy was paying to have such flags sewn in the 1620s.\n\n==History==\n===England (pre-1707)===\n[[File:English Red Ensign 1620.svg|250px|right|thumb|{{FIAV|historical|n}}The English Red Ensign as it appeared in the 17th century]]\nPrior to the reorganisation of the [[Royal Navy]] in 1864, the plain red ensign had been the ensign of one of three squadrons of the Royal Navy, the [[Coloured squadrons of the Royal Navy|Red Squadron]], as early as 1558. By 1620, the plain red ensign started to appear with the [[Saint George's Cross|Cross of St George]] in the [[canton (flag)|canton]].\n\nThe [[Colony of Massachusetts]] used the red ensign from its founding; after a sermon by [[Roger Williams]] in 1636, equating crosses with the [[papacy]], Governor [[John Endecott|Endicott]] ordered the St George cross removed from the flag. The Great and General Court of the colony found that Endicott had \"exceeded the lymits of his calling\", and yet left the flag without its cross for a number of decades afterward.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20070401075528/http://www.midcoast.com/~martucci/flags/NEFlag.html</ref>\n\nIn 1674, a Royal Proclamation of King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (1630\u20131685, reigned 1660\u20131685) confirmed that the Red Ensign was the appropriate flag to be worn by English [[merchant marine|merchant ships]]. The wording of the 1674 proclamation indicates that the flag was customarily being used by English merchantmen before that date. At this time, the ensign displayed the Cross of St George in the canton. This changed in 1864, when an order in council provided that the Red Ensign was allocated to merchantmen.\n\n===Scotland (pre-1707)===\n[[File:Scottish Red Ensign.svg|250px|right|thumb|{{FIAV|historical|n}}The Scottish Red Ensign, flown by ships of the former [[Royal Scots Navy]] before it was merged into the British [[Royal Navy]] in 1707]]\nIt is probable that the cross-saltire was adopted by the Scots as a national ensign at a very early period, but there seems no direct evidence of this before the fourteenth century. The earliest Scottish records were lost at sea in the ship that was sent to return them to that country, whence they had been carried off, with the \"[[Stone of Scone|Stone of Destiny]]\", by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] (1239\u20131307, reigned 1272\u20131307). Prior to 1707, the Scottish Red Ensign was flown by ships of the [[Royal Scots Navy]], with a [[Flag of Scotland|saltire]] in the canton.\n\nThe Scottish Ensign has been flown unofficially by many Scottish vessels for a number of years. In 2015, a movement was launched by Lieutenant Commander George MacKenzie [[Royal Naval Reserve|RNR]] to have the Scottish Ensign officially recognised, on the basis that the Merchant Shipping Act of 1995 permits Her Majesty the Queen in Council or a Secretary of State to approve \"any colours consisting of the Red Ensign defaced or modified\". Supporters cited the example of the States of [[Jersey]], who in 2010 were permitted to use a \"voluntary or informal\" red ensign, adorned with a [[Plantagenet]] crown.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/could-scottish-ensign-replace-union-jack-on-ships-1-3777602|title=Could Scottish Ensign replace Union Jack on ships?|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=19 May 2015| access-date=1 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.scot/comment/14850611.Michael_Russell__Petition_aims_to_see_boats_flying_the_flag_for_Scotland/|title=Michael Russell: Petition aims to see boats flying the flag for Scotland|first=Michael|last=Russell|newspaper=The National|date=19 May 2015| \naccess-date=1 November 2018}}</ref> The movement culminated in a petition for the [[Scottish Government]] to seek a warrant from the U.K. government to reintroduce the flag as an \"informal or voluntary ensign\" for Scottish merchant vessels.

An Order in Council of 21 July 1707, established as naval flags of the royal standard, the Union flag and \"the ensign directed by her Majesty since the said Union of the two Kingdoms\", which from the coloured drafts attached to the order is seen to be the red ensign. The white and blue ensigns are not mentioned in this Order; evidently the red ensign was alone regarded as the legal ensign of [[Great Britain]] and the others as merely variations of it for tactical purposes.<ref>W. G. Perrin, ''British Flags'' (1922)</ref>\n\nIn 1707, [[Act of Union 1707|Acts of Union]], ratifying the [[Treaty of Union]] that had been agreed the previous year, were passed by the parliaments of [[Parliament of England|England]] and [[Parliament of Scotland|Scotland]], thereby uniting the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] with the [[Kingdom of England]] (which included the [[Wales|Principality of Wales]]) into a new state with the name \"[[Kingdom of Great Britain]]\". This resulted in a new red ensign which placed the first [[Flag of Great Britain|Union Flag]] in the first quarter. The new design of the Red Ensign was proclaimed by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] (1665\u20131714, reigned 1702\u20131714), who indicated that it was to be used by both the navy and ships owned by \"our loving subjects\". \n\nThe flag was flown by ships of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in [[North America]] before the [[American Revolution]]. Modification of the flag was used to express the discontent of the colonists before and during the outbreak of revolution.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Capture the Flag: The Stars and Stripes in American History|last=Testi|first=Arnaldo|publisher=New York University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York, N.Y|pages=16}}</ref> This can be seen in both the [[Flag of Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton flag]] and the [[George Rex Flag|George Rex flag]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Citizens or Papists?

The [[Saint Patrick's Flag|St Patrick's Cross]] was added to the Union Flag and, accordingly, to the first quarters of the British ensigns.\n\nThe [[Merchant Shipping Act 1854]] included a specific provision that the Red Ensign was the appropriate flag for a British merchantman. This provision was repeated in successive British shipping legislation (i.e., [[Merchant Shipping Act 1889|1889]], [[Merchant Shipping Act 1894|1894]] (section 73) and [[Merchant Shipping Act 1995|1995]]).\n\nUntil 1864, the Red Ensign was also the principal ensign of the Royal Navy, and as such it was worn by ships of the Red Squadron of the navy, as well as by those warships that were not assigned to any squadron (i.e., those sailing under independent command). The white ensign and the blue ensign were also used by the Royal Navy.\n\nMany in the [[Admiralty]] felt that the Royal Navy's use of three separate ensigns (i.e., the red, white, and blue) was outdated and confusing. Many also felt that steam merchantmen should be clearly distinguishable from warships. In July 1864, an [[order-in-council]] provided that the White Ensign was the ensign of the Royal Naval Service. The Blue Ensign was designated as the proper national colours for ships commanded by an officer of the [[Royal Naval Reserve]], and (with an appropriate badge) as national colours for ships in government service. The Red Ensign was assigned to British merchantmen. This basic structure remains today.\n\nA few years later (1867\u20131869), the Admiralty determined that the [[Blue Ensign|blue ensign]] charged with an appropriate badge in the fly would be used as the ensign by those ships in the armed, or public, service of the many British colonies. Most British colonies needed to use the blue ensign due to the fact that most had government vessels; some colonies, such as South Australia, had warships. As a result, the Blue Ensign was used throughout the Empire and thus became the model for the flags used by a number of colonies and former colonies in the [[British Empire]]. At the same time, the red ensign (which was designated in 1864 as the flag for merchant shipping) was used by merchantmen of those colonies which obtained an Admiralty warrant. Not all colonies obtained an Admiralty warrant, however; the ones that did tended to be larger, and included Canada (1892); New Zealand (1899); Australia (1901); South Africa (1910) and [[Cyprus]] (1922). Those areas that did not have an Admiralty warrant used the plain Red Ensign, although unofficial local versions of the Red Ensign were used.\n\n{{As of|2005|alt=Today}}, Red Ensigns charged with the local emblem are available to be used by ships registered on several of the component registers of the Red Ensign Group:  [[Bermuda]], [[British Virgin Islands]], [[Cayman Islands]], [[Falkland Islands]], [[Gibraltar]], [[Guernsey]], [[Jersey]], and [[Isle of Man]].\n\n==Plain red ensign==\nThe plain red ensign is the [[civil ensign]] or merchant ensign of the [[United Kingdom]]. The flag has overall ratio of 1:2 with the [[Union Jack|Union]] occupying one quarter of the field and placed in the [[Canton (flag)|canton]].\n\n==Defaced red ensign==\nSome government departments or public bodies fly red ensigns [[Defacement (flag)|defaced]] with a badge or emblem, to form the ensign of United Kingdom.

The flag has apparently been flown unofficially since Bermuda's arms were granted in 1910. There appears to be no formal adoption of the Bermuda flag for use on land, although a 1969 [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] circular mentions its use. The white and green shield has a red lion holding a scrolled shield showing the sinking of the ship ''[[Sea Venture]]'' off of Bermuda in 1609. The Red Ensign is likely to have been chosen as Bermuda's land flag due to Canadian influence. (In the early 20th century, Canada made use of the Red Ensign defaced with the Canadian shield as an unofficial land flag.) Bermuda's 2002 shipping legislation officially recognises the flag as an ensign for Bermudian registered ships. Prior to 2002, the flag was often used unofficially by Bermudian ships as an ensign, as reflected in Admiralty correspondence dating back to the 1950s. Bermuda (civil) Government vessels and maritime services use the [[Blue Ensign#Defaced blue ensign|defaced blue ensign]], which is flown both from vessels and from shore facilities.\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Gibraltar====\n[[File:Civil_Ensign_of_Gibraltar.svg|250px|right|thumb|[[Gibraltar]]'s Red Ensign]]\n[[Gibraltar]] features variant flags of the territory which incorporate the Gibraltar [[Coat of arms of Gibraltar|coat of arms]] into a red ensign.

From 1901 to 1954 the flag was used as a civil flag, to be flown by private citizens on land, while the government used the Blue Ensign, reflecting British practice. In 1941, Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] stated that there should be no restrictions on private citizens using the Blue Ensign on land, and in 1947 Prime Minister [[Ben Chifley]] reaffirmed this position, but it was not until the passage of the Flags Act 1953 that the restriction on civilians flying the Blue Ensign was officially lifted, after which use of the Red Ensign on land became a rarity. Under the Navigation and Shipping Act 1912 and the Shipping Registration Act 1981, the Red Ensign remains the only flag permitted for use by merchant ships registered in Australia. Pleasure craft may use either the Red Ensign or the national flag, but not both at the same time.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C00182/c53816f1-e166-4a20-b073-5b59c8003a02\n|title=Shipping Registration Act 1981\n|pages=10, 22\n|accessdate=2012-04-25\n}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Canada===\n{{main|Canadian Red Ensign}}\n{{See also|Great Canadian Flag Debate|Flag of Manitoba|Flag of Ontario}}\n[[File:Canadian Red Ensign 1868-1921.svg|250px|thumb|right|{{FIAV|historical|n}}Canadian flag (1868\u20131921)]]\n[[File:Canadian Red Ensign 1921-1957.svg|250px|thumb|right|{{FIAV|historical|n}}Canadian flag (1921\u20131957)]]\n[[File:Canadian Red Ensign 1957-1965.svg|250px|thumb|right|{{FIAV|historical|n}}Final Canadian Red Ensign (1957\u20131965)]]\n\nThe term \"Red Ensign\" is often used to refer to the [[Canadian Red Ensign]], the former ''de facto'' [[national flag]] of Canada. It was informally adopted following [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867 and, from 1892, it was the official flag for use on Canadian merchant ships. On land, however, the official national flag was the Union Flag. Despite its unofficial status, the Red Ensign was widely used on land as well. In 1924, the Red Ensign was approved for use on Canadian government buildings outside Canada, and from 1945 for those inside Canada as well.\n\nCanada's Red Ensign bore various forms of the shield from the [[Coat of Arms of Canada|Canadian coat of arms]] in its fly during the period of its use. Shown here are pictures of the three official forms between 1868 and 1965. Canada also used a [[blue ensign]] for ships operated by the Canadian government and for the [[Royal Canadian Navy]].\n\nThe Red Ensign served as Canada's national flag until 1965 when, after considerable [[Great Canadian Flag Debate|debate]], it was replaced by the [[Flag of Canada|Maple Leaf flag]]. The Red Ensign is still popular among [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalists]] and [[Monarchism in Canada|monarchists]]. Although the national Red Ensign is no longer used officially, the provincial flags of [[Flag of Manitoba|Manitoba]] and [[Flag of Ontario|Ontario]] are Red Ensigns bearing their respective coats of arms.\n\nThe [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and the [[North West Company]] also used Red Ensigns as their corporate flags.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Flag of Ontario.svg|Ontario's official flag since 1965\nFile:Flag of Manitoba.svg|Manitoba's official flag since 1966\nFile:Hudson's Bay Company Flag.svg|Hudson's Bay Company corporate flag\nFile:Hudson's Bay Company Flag (1707-1801).svg|HBC flag, 1707-1801\nFile:Hudson's Bay Company Flag (1682-1707).svg|HBC flag, 1682-1707\nFile:Flag of the North West Company Post-1801.svg|[[North West Company]] flag, 1801-1821\nFile:Flag of the North West Company Pre-1801.svg|North West Company flag before 1801\n</gallery>\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Newfoundland====\n[[File:Dominion of Newfoundland Red Ensign.svg|250px|right|thumb|{{FIAV|historical|n}}Newfoundland Red Ensign]]\nThe Red Ensign with the Newfoundland great seal in the fly was considered the unofficial flag of the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] from 1904 until 1931, at which point it was officially legislated as the Dominion of Newfoundland's \"National Colours\" to be flown as the [[civil ensign]], with the [[Union Flag]] being legislated as the national flag at that time as well.

It is one of the [[British ensign]]s, and it is used either plain or [[defacement (flag)|defaced]] with a badge or other [[emblem]], mostly in the right half.\n\nIt is the flag flown by British merchant or passenger ships since 1707. Prior to 1707, an [[Kingdom of England|English]] red ensign and a [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish]] red ensign were flown by the English and Scottish Royal navies, respectively. The precise date of the first appearance of these earlier red ensigns is not known, but surviving payment receipts indicate that the English navy was paying to have such flags sewn in the 1620s.\n\n==History==\n===England (pre-1707)===\n[[File:English Red Ensign 1620.svg|250px|right|thumb|{{FIAV|historical|n}}The English Red Ensign as it appeared in the 17th century]]\nPrior to the reorganisation of the [[Royal Navy]] in 1864, the plain red ensign had been the ensign of one of three squadrons of the Royal Navy, the [[Coloured squadrons of the Royal Navy|Red Squadron]], as early as 1558. By 1620, the plain red ensign started to appear with the [[Saint George's Cross|Cross of St George]] in the [[canton (flag)|canton]].\n\nThe [[Colony of Massachusetts]] used the red ensign from its founding; after a sermon by [[Roger Williams]] in 1636, equating crosses with the [[papacy]], Governor [[John Endecott|Endicott]] ordered the St George cross removed from the flag. The Great and General Court of the colony found that Endicott had \"exceeded the lymits of his calling\", and yet left the flag without its cross for a number of decades afterward.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20070401075528/http://www.midcoast.com/~martucci/flags/NEFlag.html</ref>\n\nIn 1674, a Royal Proclamation of King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (1630\u20131685, reigned 1660\u20131685) confirmed that the Red Ensign was the appropriate flag to be worn by English [[merchant marine|merchant ships]]. The wording of the 1674 proclamation indicates that the flag was customarily being used by English merchantmen before that date. At this time, the ensign displayed the Cross of St George in the canton. This changed in 1864, when an order in council provided that the Red Ensign was allocated to merchantmen.\n\n===Scotland (pre-1707)===\n[[File:Scottish Red Ensign.svg|250px|right|thumb|{{FIAV|historical|n}}The Scottish Red Ensign, flown by ships of the former [[Royal Scots Navy]] before it was merged into the British [[Royal Navy]] in 1707]]\nIt is probable that the cross-saltire was adopted by the Scots as a national ensign at a very early period, but there seems no direct evidence of this before the fourteenth century. The earliest Scottish records were lost at sea in the ship that was sent to return them to that country, whence they had been carried off, with the \"[[Stone of Scone|Stone of Destiny]]\", by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] (1239\u20131307, reigned 1272\u20131307). Prior to 1707, the Scottish Red Ensign was flown by ships of the [[Royal Scots Navy]], with a [[Flag of Scotland|saltire]] in the canton.\n\nThe Scottish Ensign has been flown unofficially by many Scottish vessels for a number of years. In 2015, a movement was launched by Lieutenant Commander George MacKenzie [[Royal Naval Reserve|RNR]] to have the Scottish Ensign officially recognised, on the basis that the Merchant Shipping Act of 1995 permits Her Majesty the Queen in Council or a Secretary of State to approve \"any colours consisting of the Red Ensign defaced or modified\". Supporters cited the example of the States of [[Jersey]], who in 2010 were permitted to use a \"voluntary or informal\" red ensign, adorned with a [[Plantagenet]] crown.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/could-scottish-ensign-replace-union-jack-on-ships-1-3777602|title=Could Scottish Ensign replace Union Jack on ships?|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=19 May 2015| access-date=1 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.scot/comment/14850611.Michael_Russell__Petition_aims_to_see_boats_flying_the_flag_for_Scotland/|title=Michael Russell: Petition aims to see boats flying the flag for Scotland|first=Michael|last=Russell|newspaper=The National|date=19 May 2015| \naccess-date=1 November 2018}}</ref> The movement culminated in a petition for the [[Scottish Government]] to seek a warrant from the U.K. government to reintroduce the flag as an \"informal or voluntary ensign\" for Scottish merchant vessels.

An Order in Council of 21 July 1707, established as naval flags of the royal standard, the Union flag and \"the ensign directed by her Majesty since the said Union of the two Kingdoms\", which from the coloured drafts attached to the order is seen to be the red ensign. The white and blue ensigns are not mentioned in this Order; evidently the red ensign was alone regarded as the legal ensign of [[Great Britain]] and the others as merely variations of it for tactical purposes.<ref>W. G. Perrin, ''British Flags'' (1922)</ref>\n\nIn 1707, [[Act of Union 1707|Acts of Union]], ratifying the [[Treaty of Union]] that had been agreed the previous year, were passed by the parliaments of [[Parliament of England|England]] and [[Parliament of Scotland|Scotland]], thereby uniting the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] with the [[Kingdom of England]] (which included the [[Wales|Principality of Wales]]) into a new state with the name \"[[Kingdom of Great Britain]]\". This resulted in a new red ensign which placed the first [[Flag of Great Britain|Union Flag]] in the first quarter. The new design of the Red Ensign was proclaimed by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] (1665\u20131714, reigned 1702\u20131714), who indicated that it was to be used by both the navy and ships owned by \"our loving subjects\". \n\nThe flag was flown by ships of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in [[North America]] before the [[American Revolution]]. Modification of the flag was used to express the discontent of the colonists before and during the outbreak of revolution.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Capture the Flag: The Stars and Stripes in American History|last=Testi|first=Arnaldo|publisher=New York University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York, N.Y|pages=16}}</ref> This can be seen in both the [[Flag of Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton flag]] and the [[George Rex Flag|George Rex flag]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Citizens or Papists?

The [[Saint Patrick's Flag|St Patrick's Cross]] was added to the Union Flag and, accordingly, to the first quarters of the British ensigns.\n\nThe [[Merchant Shipping Act 1854]] included a specific provision that the Red Ensign was the appropriate flag for a British merchantman. This provision was repeated in successive British shipping legislation (i.e., [[Merchant Shipping Act 1889|1889]], [[Merchant Shipping Act 1894|1894]] (section 73) and [[Merchant Shipping Act 1995|1995]]).\n\nUntil 1864, the Red Ensign was also the principal ensign of the Royal Navy, and as such it was worn by ships of the Red Squadron of the navy, as well as by those warships that were not assigned to any squadron (i.e., those sailing under independent command). The white ensign and the blue ensign were also used by the Royal Navy.\n\nMany in the [[Admiralty]] felt that the Royal Navy's use of three separate ensigns (i.e., the red, white, and blue) was outdated and confusing. Many also felt that steam merchantmen should be clearly distinguishable from warships. In July 1864, an [[order-in-council]] provided that the White Ensign was the ensign of the Royal Naval Service. The Blue Ensign was designated as the proper national colours for ships commanded by an officer of the [[Royal Naval Reserve]], and (with an appropriate badge) as national colours for ships in government service. The Red Ensign was assigned to British merchantmen. This basic structure remains today.\n\nA few years later (1867\u20131869), the Admiralty determined that the [[Blue Ensign|blue ensign]] charged with an appropriate badge in the fly would be used as the ensign by those ships in the armed, or public, service of the many British colonies. Most British colonies needed to use the blue ensign due to the fact that most had government vessels; some colonies, such as South Australia, had warships. As a result, the Blue Ensign was used throughout the Empire and thus became the model for the flags used by a number of colonies and former colonies in the [[British Empire]]. At the same time, the red ensign (which was designated in 1864 as the flag for merchant shipping) was used by merchantmen of those colonies which obtained an Admiralty warrant. Not all colonies obtained an Admiralty warrant, however; the ones that did tended to be larger, and included Canada (1892); New Zealand (1899); Australia (1901); South Africa (1910) and [[Cyprus]] (1922). Those areas that did not have an Admiralty warrant used the plain Red Ensign, although unofficial local versions of the Red Ensign were used.\n\n{{As of|2005|alt=Today}}, Red Ensigns charged with the local emblem are available to be used by ships registered on several of the component registers of the Red Ensign Group:  [[Bermuda]], [[British Virgin Islands]], [[Cayman Islands]], [[Falkland Islands]], [[Gibraltar]], [[Guernsey]], [[Jersey]], and [[Isle of Man]].\n\n==Plain red ensign==\nThe plain red ensign is the [[civil ensign]] or merchant ensign of the [[United Kingdom]]. The flag has overall ratio of 1:2 with the [[Union Jack|Union]] occupying one quarter of the field and placed in the [[Canton (flag)|canton]].\n\n==Defaced red ensign==\nSome government departments or public bodies fly red ensigns [[Defacement (flag)|defaced]] with a badge or emblem, to form the ensign of United Kingdom.

The flag has apparently been flown unofficially since Bermuda's arms were granted in 1910. There appears to be no formal adoption of the Bermuda flag for use on land, although a 1969 [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] circular mentions its use. The white and green shield has a red lion holding a scrolled shield showing the sinking of the ship ''[[Sea Venture]]'' off of Bermuda in 1609. The Red Ensign is likely to have been chosen as Bermuda's land flag due to Canadian influence. (In the early 20th century, Canada made use of the Red Ensign defaced with the Canadian shield as an unofficial land flag.) Bermuda's 2002 shipping legislation officially recognises the flag as an ensign for Bermudian registered ships. Prior to 2002, the flag was often used unofficially by Bermudian ships as an ensign, as reflected in Admiralty correspondence dating back to the 1950s.

From 1901 to 1954 the flag was used as a civil flag, to be flown by private citizens on land, while the government used the Blue Ensign, reflecting British practice. In 1941, Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] stated that there should be no restrictions on private citizens using the Blue Ensign on land, and in 1947 Prime Minister [[Ben Chifley]] reaffirmed this position, but it was not until the passage of the Flags Act 1953 that the restriction on civilians flying the Blue Ensign was officially lifted, after which use of the Red Ensign on land became a rarity. Under the Navigation and Shipping Act 1912 and the Shipping Registration Act 1981, the Red Ensign remains the only flag permitted for use by merchant ships registered in Australia.

It was informally adopted following [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867 and, from 1892, it was the official flag for use on Canadian merchant ships. On land, however, the official national flag was the Union Flag. Despite its unofficial status, the Red Ensign was widely used on land as well. In 1924, the Red Ensign was approved for use on Canadian government buildings outside Canada, and from 1945 for those inside Canada as well.\n\nCanada's Red Ensign bore various forms of the shield from the [[Coat of Arms of Canada|Canadian coat of arms]] in its fly during the period of its use. Shown here are pictures of the three official forms between 1868 and 1965.

Taupin, the US-based French poet and critic, concluded that free verse and ''vers libre'' are not synonymous, since \"the French language tends to give equal [[Syllable weight|weight]] to each spoken syllable, whereas English syllables vary in quantity according to whether [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed or unstressed]].\"<ref>Taupin, Rene.

A clear example of this can be found in [[Walt Whitman]]'s poems, where he repeats certain phrases and uses commas to create both a rhythm and structure.\n\nPattern and discipline is to be found in good free verse: the internal pattern of sounds, the choice of exact words, and the effect of associations give free verse its beauty.<ref>Boulton, Marjories, ''Anatomy of Poetry'', Routledge&Kegan, London 1953</ref> With the [[Imagists]] free verse became a discipline and acquired status as a legitimate poetic form.<ref>Pratt, William.

Taupin, the US-based French poet and critic, concluded that free verse and ''vers libre'' are not synonymous, since \"the French language tends to give equal [[Syllable weight|weight]] to each spoken syllable, whereas English syllables vary in quantity according to whether [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed or unstressed]].\"<ref>Taupin, Rene.

[[Christina Rossetti]], [[Coventry Patmore]], and [[T. E. Brown]] all wrote examples of rhymed but unmetered verse, poems such as [[W. E. Henley]]'s \"Discharged\" (from his ''In Hospital'' sequence).\n\nFree verse in English was persuasively advocated by critic [[T. E. Hulme]] in his ''[[A Lecture on Modern Poetry]]'' (1908). Later in the preface to ''Some Imagist Poets'' 1916, he comments, \"Only the name is new, you will find something much like ''vers libre'' in [[John Dryden|Dryden]]'s ''Threnodia Augustalis''; a great deal of [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Samson Agonistes]]'', and the oldest in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] ''[[The House of Fame|House of Fame]]''.\"<ref>Preface to ''Some Imagist Poets'', Constable, 1916</ref>\n\nIn France, a few pieces in [[Arthur Rimbaud]]'s [[prose poem]] collection ''[[Illuminations (poems)|Illuminations]]'' were arranged in manuscript in lines, rather than prose, and in the Netherlands, [[tachtiger]] (i.e., a member of the 1880s generation of innovative poets) [[Frederik van Eeden]] employed the form at least once in his poem \"Waterlelie\" (\"Water Lily\").<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://4umi.com/vaneeden/waterlelie.htm|title=De waterlelie < Frederik van Eeden|website=4umi.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Goethe]]\u2014particularly in some early poems, such as \"[[Prometheus (Goethe)|Prometheus]]\"\u2014and [[H\u00f6lderlin]] used free verse occasionally, due in part to a misinterpretation of the meter used in [[Pindar]]'s poetry; in H\u00f6lderlin's case, he also continued to write unmetered poems after discovering this error.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ELuZzgnE81MC&pg=PR15 Michael Hamburger: ''Foreword''] in Robert Marcellus Browning (ed.): ''German poetry from 1750 to 1900'' (''The German Library'', vol. 39), New York: The Continuum Publishing Company, 1984, p.

A clear example of this can be found in [[Walt Whitman]]'s poems, where he repeats certain phrases and uses commas to create both a rhythm and structure.\n\nPattern and discipline is to be found in good free verse: the internal pattern of sounds, the choice of exact words, and the effect of associations give free verse its beauty.<ref>Boulton, Marjories, ''Anatomy of Poetry'', Routledge&Kegan, London 1953</ref> With the [[Imagists]] free verse became a discipline and acquired status as a legitimate poetic form.<ref>Pratt, William.
