A leader of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]], he was Irrigation Minister of Odisha from 1990 to 1995 in the [[Biju Patnaik]] [[Cabinet of India|cabinet]]. He was the most powerful minister (known as Super Chief Minister) in [[Biju Patnaik]]'s cabinet. He was a four time [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|MLA]] from [[Patkura (Odisha Vidhan Sabha constituency)|Patkura Constituency]] of [[Kendrapara (Odisha Vidhan Sabha constituency)|Kendrapara district]]. He won four straight elections in 1980, 1985, 1990 and 1995.\n\nAfter the completion of his [[secondary education|early education]] at Korua High School, in 1965, Mohapatra received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree from Kendrapara [[College]], [[Utkal University]] in 1969. He later received his [[Bachelor of Laws|LLB]].\n\n==Political career==\nMohapatra played an instrumental role in the formation of [[Biju Janata Dal]] in 1997 after the demise of Biju Pattanaik. He was one of the founding members of Biju Janata Dal and one of the most powerful [[party leader|leaders in the party]]. He was the [[Chairman]] of the Political Affairs Committee of the party. He was the leader of a group of leaders in the [[political party|party]], and was opposed to many decisions of party President [[Naveen Patnaik]].\n\nIn 2000, after filing nomination paper for the Odisha Assembly elections of 2000, Mohapatra was busy in parliamentary board meeting of [[Biju Janata Dal]] as the chairman of parliamentary affairs committee. In the meantime, [[Naveen Patnaik]] as the President of the party, cancelled Mohapatra's ticket and gave it to Atanu sabyasachi Nayak, a journalist who is a son of Ex MLA . Due to lack of time Bijoy couldn't reach to file a new nomination. Bijoy proceeded to support Trilocahan Behera, a candidate of the [[Trinamool Congress]], who won the seat by more than 40,000 votes over Atanu Sabyasachi, the official BJD nominee. The understanding was that Behera would vacate the seat for Bijoy.It is speculated that leaders like [[Pyarimohan Mohapatra]] had a role behind the ouster of Bijoy.\n\nHowever, supporters of Mohapatra in the BJD could not get a majority in the BJD legislature party in the 2000 elections. As a result, Navin Patnaik was elected as the leader of BJD legislature Party and a BJD-BJP government came to power in Odisha. After his failure to get the post of BJD legislature party, many of Mohapatra's supporters in the BJD kept mum or even supported Naveen Patnaik.\n\nIn 2001, Bijoy formed [[Odisha Gana Parishad]], a regional party. A majority of his supporters in the BJD did not join it, though, as they did not want to lose their power. The OGP formed an alliance with the [[Indian National Congress]] in the 2004 assembly elections, and got only four seats to contest. The Party won two of these seats, but Mohapatra narrowly lost his bid.\n\nDue to financial constraints, Bijoy decided to merge his party with the [[Nationalist Congress Party|NCP]], and became its head in Odisha. However, before the 2009 elections, [[Sharad Pawar]], NCP National President decided to ally with BJD. In protest, Bijoy resigned from NCP in 2009 and joined BJP.\n\nPresently, Mohapatra is a national executive member of BJP. However, due to very poor organisational strength of BJP in coastal Odisha, Bijoy lost the Assembly elections in 2009 and 2014, contesting from the [[Patkura]] and [[Mahakalapada (Odisha Vidhan Sabha constituency)|Mahakalapada]] Assembly seats respectively. Despite the setbacks, Mohapatra has decided to stay with BJP for the present. He was selected as the Campaign Committee Chairman of BJP for the [[Kandhamal (Lok Sabha constituency)|Kandhamal Lok Sabha]] by-election in 2014.\n\nBijoy was sidelined in Odisha BJP since 2016, when Basant Panda was elected as BJP state President. He finally quit BJP on 30 November 2018 but returned again to BJP on 27 March 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/amp/news/india/will-no-longer-be-showpieces-senior-leaders-dilip-ray-bijoy-mahapatra-quit-bjp-in-odisha-1955673.html|title='Will No Longer be Showpieces': Senior Leaders Dilip Ray, Bijoy Mahapatra Quit BJP in Odisha}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1705/17050150.htm|title=On a roll in Orissa|website=www.frontline.in}}</ref>\n<ref>{{YouTube|9_x_h037dCE}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1140503/jsp/odisha/story_18302286.jsp|title=Naveen has no moral guts, authority|website=www.telegraphindia.com}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/will-bijoy-mohapatra-be-third-time-lucky/article5899766.ece|title=Will Bijoy Mohapatra be third time lucky?|first=Satyasundar|last=Barik|date=11 April 2014|publisher=|via=www.thehindu.com|newspaper=The Hindu}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://odishachannel.com/index.php/1860/bijoy-to-head-bjps-campaign-in-kandhamal/|title=Bijoy to head BJP's campaign in Kandhamal -

He suggests that the Qur'anic text underwent a series of secondary omissions and additions which were designed to adapt the text to the dogma of finality of prophethood, and that the idea of finality only became the prevailing interpretation (alongside the notion of confirmation or fulfillment) by the end of the 1st century AH / 7th century.<ref name=rubin/><ref name=powers>{{cite book|last1=Powers|first1=David S.|title=Mu\u1e25ammad is Not the Father of Any of Your Men: The Making of the Last Prophet|date=2009|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780812241785}}</ref> In a review of Powers' book, [[Gerald Hawting]] goes further, suggesting that the development of the doctrine was not complete before the 3rd century AH / 9th century.<ref name=rubin/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hawting|first1=G.R.|title=Muhammad Is Not the Father of Any of Your Men: The Making of the Last Prophet|journal=Islamic Law and Society|date=1 February 2011|volume=18|issue=1|pages=116\u2013119|doi=10.1163/156851910X538396}}</ref> Madelung comments that Power's argument, that verses 36-40 are a later addition dating from the generation after Muhammad's death, is \"hardly sustainable.\"<ref name=madelung/>\n\n[[Uri Rubin]] holds that the finality of prophethood is a Qur'anic idea, not a post-Qur'anic one, and that the expression ''khatam an-nabiyyin'' implies both finality of prophethood and confirmation. In response to Powers and other modern scholars skeptical of the early origin of the doctrine, Rubin concludes from his study \"that, at least as far as Sura 33 is concerned, the consonantal structure of the Qur'anic text has not been tampered with, and that the idea of finality of prophethood is well-represented in the text, as well as in the earliest available extra-Quranic materials.\" Rubin reexamines the early extra-Qur'anic texts cited by Friedmann and other modern scholars, and concludes that rather than indicating that the notion of finality of prophethood is late, the texts confirm the early origin of the belief. He concludes that \"there is no compelling reason to assume that the Muslims of the first Islamic century originally understood the Qur'anic ''khatam an-nabiyyin'' in the sense of confirmation alone, without that of finality.\"<ref name=rubin/>\n\n==Ahmadiyya Interpretation==\n{{Main|Prophethood (Ahmadiyya)}}\n\n===Muhammad===\nThe [[Ahmadiyya Community]] (Ahmadi) while accepting Muhammad as the 'Seal of the Prophets' (Khatamun Nabiyyin) and the last prophet to have brought a complete and comprehensive universal law for humanity (last law-bearing Prophet), believe that prophethood subordinate to Muhammad is still open. Muhammad is believed to have brought prophethood to perfection and was the last law-bearing prophet, the apex of man's spiritual evolution.

He suggests that the Qur'anic text underwent a series of secondary omissions and additions which were designed to adapt the text to the dogma of finality of prophethood, and that the idea of finality only became the prevailing interpretation (alongside the notion of confirmation or fulfillment) by the end of the 1st century AH / 7th century.<ref name=rubin/><ref name=powers>{{cite book|last1=Powers|first1=David S.|title=Mu\u1e25ammad is Not the Father of Any of Your Men: The Making of the Last Prophet|date=2009|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780812241785}}</ref> In a review of Powers' book, [[Gerald Hawting]] goes further, suggesting that the development of the doctrine was not complete before the 3rd century AH / 9th century.<ref name=rubin/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hawting|first1=G.R.|title=Muhammad Is Not the Father of Any of Your Men: The Making of the Last Prophet|journal=Islamic Law and Society|date=1 February 2011|volume=18|issue=1|pages=116\u2013119|doi=10.1163/156851910X538396}}</ref> Madelung comments that Power's argument, that verses 36-40 are a later addition dating from the generation after Muhammad's death, is \"hardly sustainable.\"<ref name=madelung/>\n\n[[Uri Rubin]] holds that the finality of prophethood is a Qur'anic idea, not a post-Qur'anic one, and that the expression ''khatam an-nabiyyin'' implies both finality of prophethood and confirmation. In response to Powers and other modern scholars skeptical of the early origin of the doctrine, Rubin concludes from his study \"that, at least as far as Sura 33 is concerned, the consonantal structure of the Qur'anic text has not been tampered with, and that the idea of finality of prophethood is well-represented in the text, as well as in the earliest available extra-Quranic materials.\" Rubin reexamines the early extra-Qur'anic texts cited by Friedmann and other modern scholars, and concludes that rather than indicating that the notion of finality of prophethood is late, the texts confirm the early origin of the belief. He concludes that \"there is no compelling reason to assume that the Muslims of the first Islamic century originally understood the Qur'anic ''khatam an-nabiyyin'' in the sense of confirmation alone, without that of finality.\"<ref name=rubin/>\n\n==Ahmadiyya Interpretation==\n{{Main|Prophethood (Ahmadiyya)}}\n\n===Muhammad===\nThe [[Ahmadiyya Community]] (Ahmadi) while accepting Muhammad as the 'Seal of the Prophets' (Khatamun Nabiyyin) and the last prophet to have brought a complete and comprehensive universal law for humanity (last law-bearing Prophet), believe that prophethood subordinate to Muhammad is still open.

In previous seasons, the bottom two queens had to \"Lip-sync for their Life\" to avoid elimination. This season had the top two performing queens of the challenge \"Lip-sync for their Legacy,\" with the winner of the lip-sync earning $10,000 and choosing which one of the bottom queens gets eliminated. The prizes for the winner were a one-year supply of [[Anastasia Beverly Hills]] cosmetics and a cash prize of $100,000.\n\nThe winner of the second season of ''RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars'' was [[Alaska Thunderfuck|Alaska]], with [[Katya Zamolodchikova|Katya]] and [[Detox Icunt|Detox]] being the runners-up.\n\n==Contestants==\n{{See also|List of RuPaul's Drag Race contestants}}\n''(Ages and

His theater company is currently producing a play that stars his wife Nicole, a former teen film actress. The couple is experiencing marital troubles and sees a mediator, who suggests that they each write down what they like about one another, but Nicole is too embarrassed to read hers aloud and they decide to forgo the counseling.\n\nNicole is offered a starring role in a television pilot in [[Los Angeles]], and she decides to leave the theater company and temporarily live with her mother in [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]], taking the couple's young son Henry with her. Charlie decides to stay in New York, as the play is in the process of moving to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Despite the couple agreeing to split amicably and forgo lawyers, Nicole hires Nora Fanshaw, a family lawyer. Nicole tells Nora the full story of her relationship with Charlie and how she gradually felt neglected by him and how he rejects her ideas and desires. Nicole also reveals that she thinks Charlie slept with the stage manager of the theater company. Charlie flies out to Los Angeles to visit his family, revealing that he has won a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellowship]] grant, but Nicole serves him divorce papers. Charlie meets with Jay Marotta, a brash and expensive lawyer who urges Charlie to fight dirty, but Charlie returns to New York without hiring him. He receives a call from Nora, who urges him to get a lawyer soon or risk losing custody of Henry. Charlie returns to Los Angeles and hires Bert Spitz, an empathetic and retired family lawyer who favors a civil and conciliatory approach.\n\nOn Bert's counsel, Charlie rents an apartment in Los Angeles to be closer to his family and strengthen his custody case. Charlie wishes to avoid going to court, so Bert arranges a meeting with Nora and Nicole. Nora argues that Charlie refused to respect Nicole's wishes to move back to Los Angeles and that Henry would prefer to stay with his mother rather than fly back and forth between coasts. Bert privately advises Charlie to drop his New York residency altogether, but a frustrated Charlie refuses and decides to fire him.\n\nUsing the first payout of his MacArthur Fellowship grant, Charlie hires Jay on retainer. The case moves to court, where Nora and Jay argue aggressively on behalf of their clients and attempt to paint the other party in a negative light. Nora highlights Charlie's past infidelity and emotional distance, while Jay exaggerates Nicole's drinking habits as alcoholism and threatens criminal action for hacking into Charlie's emails. Meanwhile, Charlie and Nicole remain friendly out of court and share time with Henry, who is increasingly annoyed with the back and forth.\n\nDisillusioned with the legal process, the couple decides to meet in private away from the lawyers. A friendly discussion in Charlie's apartment devolves into a bitter argument; Nicole claims that Charlie has now fully merged with his own selfishness, and Charlie punches a hole in a wall and says he wishes that she would die. He then breaks down in shame and apologizes; Nicole comforts him. An appointed expert evaluator monitors a night in with Charlie and Henry, during which Charlie accidentally cuts himself. Soon after, the couple agrees to relax their demands and reach an equal agreement to finalize the divorce, although Nora negotiates slightly better terms for Nicole, against Nicole's wishes.\n\nA year later, Charlie's play has a successful Broadway run, while Nicole has a new boyfriend and is nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for directing an episode of her show. Charlie informs Nicole that he has taken a residency at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and will be living in Los Angeles full-time to be closer to Henry. Later, he discovers Henry reading Nicole's list of things she likes about Charlie she wrote down during counseling. Henry asks Charlie to read it aloud to him, and Charlie does so, becoming emotional as Nicole watches from afar. That evening, after attending a Halloween party together, Nicole offers to let Charlie take Henry home even though it is her night. As Charlie walks out to his car carrying a sleeping Henry, Nicole stops Charlie to tie his shoe for him. He thanks her, and they part ways once more.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Nicole Barber, Charlie's wife\n* [[Adam Driver]] as Charlie Barber, Nicole's husband\n* [[Laura Dern]] as Nora Fanshaw, Nicole's lawyer\n* [[Alan Alda]] as Bert Spitz, Charlie's second lawyer\n* [[Ray Liotta]] as Jay Marotta, Charlie's first lawyer\n* Azhy Robertson as Henry Barber, Nicole and Charlie's son\n* [[Julie Hagerty]] as Sandra, Nicole's mother\n* [[Merritt Wever]] as Cassie, Nicole's sister\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Frank\n* [[Martha Kelly]] as Nancy Katz\n* [[Mark O'Brien (actor)|Mark O'Brien]] as Carter Mitchum\n* [[Matthew Shear]] as Terry\n* [[Brooke Bloom]] as Mary Ann\n* [[Kyle Bornheimer]] as Ted\n* [[Mickey Sumner]] as Beth\n* [[Robert Smigel]] as Mediator\n* [[Rich Fulcher]] as Judge Neil Tilden\n* [[Lucas Neff]] as Pablo\n* [[Tunde Adebimpe]] as Sam\n}}\n\n[[Jasmine Cephas Jones]], [[Mary Wiseman (actress)|Mary Wiseman]], [[Matthew Maher (actor)|Matthew Maher]], [[Gideon Glick]], and [[Becca Blackwell]] appear as members of Nicole and Charlie's theater group.\n\n==Production==\nThe idea for the film first came to Baumbach in 2016, while in post-production on ''[[The Meyerowitz Stories]]''.

His theater company is currently producing a play that stars his wife Nicole, a former teen film actress. The couple is experiencing marital troubles and sees a mediator, who suggests that they each write down what they like about one another, but Nicole is too embarrassed to read hers aloud and they decide to forgo the counseling.\n\nNicole is offered a starring role in a television pilot in [[Los Angeles]], and she decides to leave the theater company and temporarily live with her mother in [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]], taking the couple's young son Henry with her. Charlie decides to stay in New York, as the play is in the process of moving to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Despite the couple agreeing to split amicably and forgo lawyers, Nicole hires Nora Fanshaw, a family lawyer. Nicole tells Nora the full story of her relationship with Charlie and how she gradually felt neglected by him and how he rejects her ideas and desires. Nicole also reveals that she thinks Charlie slept with the stage manager of the theater company. Charlie flies out to Los Angeles to visit his family, revealing that he has won a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellowship]] grant, but Nicole serves him divorce papers. Charlie meets with Jay Marotta, a brash and expensive lawyer who urges Charlie to fight dirty, but Charlie returns to New York without hiring him. He receives a call from Nora, who urges him to get a lawyer soon or risk losing custody of Henry. Charlie returns to Los Angeles and hires Bert Spitz, an empathetic and retired family lawyer who favors a civil and conciliatory approach.\n\nOn Bert's counsel, Charlie rents an apartment in Los Angeles to be closer to his family and strengthen his custody case. Charlie wishes to avoid going to court, so Bert arranges a meeting with Nora and Nicole. Nora argues that Charlie refused to respect Nicole's wishes to move back to Los Angeles and that Henry would prefer to stay with his mother rather than fly back and forth between coasts. Bert privately advises Charlie to drop his New York residency altogether, but a frustrated Charlie refuses and decides to fire him.\n\nUsing the first payout of his MacArthur Fellowship grant, Charlie hires Jay on retainer. The case moves to court, where Nora and Jay argue aggressively on behalf of their clients and attempt to paint the other party in a negative light. Nora highlights Charlie's past infidelity and emotional distance, while Jay exaggerates Nicole's drinking habits as alcoholism and threatens criminal action for hacking into Charlie's emails. Meanwhile, Charlie and Nicole remain friendly out of court and share time with Henry, who is increasingly annoyed with the back and forth.\n\nDisillusioned with the legal process, the couple decides to meet in private away from the lawyers. A friendly discussion in Charlie's apartment devolves into a bitter argument; Nicole claims that Charlie has now fully merged with his own selfishness, and Charlie punches a hole in a wall and says he wishes that she would die. He then breaks down in shame and apologizes; Nicole comforts him. An appointed expert evaluator monitors a night in with Charlie and Henry, during which Charlie accidentally cuts himself. Soon after, the couple agrees to relax their demands and reach an equal agreement to finalize the divorce, although Nora negotiates slightly better terms for Nicole, against Nicole's wishes.\n\nA year later, Charlie's play has a successful Broadway run, while Nicole has a new boyfriend and is nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for directing an episode of her show. Charlie informs Nicole that he has taken a residency at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and will be living in Los Angeles full-time to be closer to Henry. Later, he discovers Henry reading Nicole's list of things she likes about Charlie she wrote down during counseling. Henry asks Charlie to read it aloud to him, and Charlie does so, becoming emotional as Nicole watches from afar. That evening, after attending a Halloween party together, Nicole offers to let Charlie take Henry home even though it is her night. As Charlie walks out to his car carrying a sleeping Henry, Nicole stops Charlie to tie his shoe for him. He thanks her, and they part ways once more.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Nicole Barber, Charlie's wife\n* [[Adam Driver]] as Charlie Barber, Nicole's husband\n* [[Laura Dern]] as Nora Fanshaw, Nicole's lawyer\n* [[Alan Alda]] as Bert Spitz, Charlie's second lawyer\n* [[Ray Liotta]] as Jay Marotta, Charlie's first lawyer\n* Azhy Robertson as Henry Barber, Nicole and Charlie's son\n* [[Julie Hagerty]] as Sandra, Nicole's mother\n* [[Merritt Wever]] as Cassie, Nicole's sister\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Frank\n* [[Martha Kelly]] as Nancy Katz\n* [[Mark O'Brien (actor)|Mark O'Brien]] as Carter Mitchum\n* [[Matthew Shear]] as Terry\n* [[Brooke Bloom]] as Mary Ann\n* [[Kyle Bornheimer]] as Ted\n* [[Mickey Sumner]] as Beth\n* [[Robert Smigel]] as Mediator\n* [[Rich Fulcher]] as Judge Neil Tilden\n* [[Lucas Neff]] as Pablo\n* [[Tunde Adebimpe]] as Sam\n}}\n\n[[Jasmine Cephas Jones]], [[Mary Wiseman (actress)|Mary Wiseman]], [[Matthew Maher (actor)|Matthew Maher]], [[Gideon Glick]], and [[Becca Blackwell]] appear as members of Nicole and Charlie's theater group.\n\n==Production==\nThe idea for the film first came to Baumbach in 2016, while in post-production on ''[[The Meyerowitz Stories]]''.

The nationalists have combined this campaign with the [[Battle of Siping]] as part of the battle, but this was rather misleading since the strategies for both sides were totally different from the strategies in this campaign and unrelated to each other, furthermore, the commanders for both sides in this campaign were completely different from the [[Battle of Siping]].  More importantly, the nationalists in the [[Battle of Siping]] was in name only, because they were former nationalists (mostly [[Warlord era|warlords]] ostensively under nationalist reign) turned Japanese puppet regime forces who rejoined the nationalists after [[World War II]], and the local bandits recruited by the nationalist administrators to fight off communists, since [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s nationalist regime simply did not have the resource to rapidly deploy his forces into the region.  In fact, in the [[Battle of Siping]], Chiang's own force did not even participated in the fights.  This campaign was characterized by the fact that the supreme commanders of both sides had overestimated their strength and set unrealistic goals that could doom their troops in the field, but in both cases, the brilliant frontline commanders on both sides had successfully averted the potential catastrophes by convincing their respective supreme commanders to change their original decisions.\n\n==Prelude==\nAfter the defeat of [[Jinjiatun Campaign]], the nationalists resumed their offensive with vengeance.  In a short period of just two days, the nationalists were able to regroup and re-supply completely, and continued their push toward Siping.  [[Chiang Kai-shek]] was determined to take [[Changchun]] after taking Siping, and [[Mao Zedong]] was equally determined to hold Siping  to the end and prevent the nationalists from taking both Siping and Changchun.  Both sides realized the upcoming campaign would be a difficult one and both sides placed one of their best field commanders in charge:  [[Du Yuming]] for the nationalists and [[Lin Biao]] for the communists.\n\n==Order of battle==\nAttackers: nationalist [[order of battle]]:\n*[[New 1st Army]]\n*[[New 6th Army]]\n*71st Army\n*93rd Army\n*Army-sized 207th Division of the Youth Army\nDefenders: communist [[order of battle]]:\n* Wan Yi (\u4e07\u6bc5) Column\n*Southern Manchurian 3rd Column\n*Western Manchurian 3rd [[Division (military)|Division]]\n*Northern Manchurian 7th Division\n*[[Shandong]] 1st Division\n*[[Shandong]] 2nd Division\n*[[Shandong]] 3rd Division\n*3rd Division of the [[New Fourth Army]]\n*8th [[Brigade]] of the [[New Fourth Army]]\n*359th Brigade\n\n==First stage==\nUnder [[Mao Zedong]]'s strategy, the communists were determined to hold Siping to the end.  In order to fortify the city, everyone was mobilized to build bunkers inside the city, while food, ammunition and other supplies were stacked.  [[Lin Biao]] and Mao Zedong had personally inspected communist fortifications at important defensive positions such as Pagoda Mountain (Ta Zi Shan, \u5854\u5b50\u5c71) and Three Lines of Groves (San Dao Lin Zi, \u4e09\u9053\u6797\u5b50) with [[Peng Zhen]] in preparation for a prolonged campaign.  Lin Biao also held a conference at Pear Tree (Li Shu, \u68a8\u6811) county to plan the strategy of the defense:  To better coordinate the defense of Siping, the communist formed an urban defense command inside the city headed by the Ma Renxing (\u9a6c\u4ec1\u5174), the commander of the communist 1st Brigade, while the general headquarters retreated to the suburb at Pear Tree (Li Shu, \u68a8\u6811) county.  In order to boost the morale of defenders, a newspaper titled \"Self Defense Newspaper\" was created with Chen Yi (\u9648\u6c82), the deputy director of the political directorate of the communist general headquarters as the chief editor.  The communist decided to deploy only two regiments in the city to check the nationalist attacks while the bulk of their force would be deployed in the rear, in the region between Siping and Pear Tree (Li Shu, \u68a8\u6811) county and the region between Siping and the Eight Sided City (Ba Mian Cheng, \u516b\u9762\u57ce).  Once the attacking nationalists were checked by the defensive force of the city in fortification, the communists would then concentrate their force to strike the weakest nationalist 71st Army.\n\nOn April 17, 1946, nationalist frontline commander [[Zheng Dongguo]] (\u90d1\u6d1e\u56fd) and his deputy [[Liang Huasheng]] (\u6881\u534e\u76db) moved their headquarters to Twin Temples (Shuang Miao Zi, \u53cc\u5e99\u5b50) and ordered an immediate attack on the city.  On April 18, the railways reaching the city was successfully severed.  Two regiments of the 30th Division of the nationalist 71st Army under the command of [[Chen Mingren]] (\u9648\u660e\u4ec1) attacked the enemy positions from the south from Haifeng Village (Haifeng Tun, \u6d77\u4e30\u5c6f), Pobozi (\u6cca\u8116\u5b50), and Duck Lake Pao (Ya Hu Pao, \u9e2d\u6e56\u6ce1) regions, but were beaten back three times consecutively.  After the initial setback, Zheng Dongguo (\u90d1\u6d1e\u56fd) held a military conference on April 19.  The nationalist army and divisional commanders attending the conference concluded that the frontal attack on the strongly defended enemy positions was impossible, and attacks from flanks or other weak points must be selected instead in order to achieve a successful breakthrough.  The railway junctions that provided the link between the 3rd Battalion of the communist 1st Regiment and the communist 56th Regiment appeared to be a good point for the breakthrough.  After the conference, under heavy artillery cover, the 30th Division of the nationalist New 1st Army launched its offensive on the junction of the two communist units, and the nationalists had successfully taken the enemy position as expected.  The loss of the position at the railway junction signaled that the defensive force inside the city must be strengthened and Lin Biao immediately did so, and informed the defenders in the city.\n\nThe arrival of the reinforcements greatly boosted the morale of the defenders and the advance guard of the 21st Regiment of the 7th Brigade of the communist Western Manchurian 3rd Division launched a counterassault on the nationalists with the help of other communist units, and successfully took back the positions at railway junction previously lost on the same afternoon, while inflicting heavy casualties on the nationalists in the process, and the heavy casualties stopped the offensive of the nationalist 30th Division completely.  After the struggle for Siping had begun, both Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong in their distant headquarters were concerned about the development and both frequently inquired the progress on the battlefield.  Chiang was determined to take Changchun and thus Siping must be taken first to open the path for Changchun, while Mao felt that Siping must be held at all cost and on April 22, Mao telegraphed Lin Biao to order him to hold on and wait for the campaign to turn for the better.  From April 18, through April 26, 3 divisions from the nationalist New 1st Army and the 71st Army took turns to assault the enemy positions, but were all beaten back by the enemy in favorable terrain.  By the evening of April 26, 1946, heavy casualties forced the offensive of the nationalist 71st Army to a complete stop, while that of the nationalist [[New 1st Army]] was reduced to skirmishes.\n\nAfter failing to make significant progress, the nationalists resorted to artillery to shell the enemy, but this resulted in a disastrous failure.  The terrain favored the defenders in that there were relatively few artillery positions outside the city for shelling the city, and defenders were well aware these positions.  The nationalists enjoyed numerical superiorities in artillery so these positions were jammed with nationalist batteries.  The enemy defending the city, on the other hand, had fewer artilleries and thus was forced to move around whenever and wherever they were needed, and such frequent and rapid movement to the next new position where artillery support was needed helped the enemy artilleries from being shelled by the nationalist counter-artillery fire.  In contrast, nationalist artillery was the first to fire for most of the time, but after firing, they were not able to move around due to limited positions available and the high concentration of batteries deployed in the few available positions.  As a result, the nationalist batteries became victims of enemy counter-artillery fire and suffered great loss.  When nationalists were forced to withdraw their batteries from the few available artillery positions to avoid losses, the enemy was out of range.  As a result, the attacking nationalists lost the artillery duel.  Mao was happy that the nationalist attack was beaten back again, and on April 27, 1946, telegraphed Lin Biao to praise him and his troop, and asked Lin Biao to deploy one or two more regiments to develop Siping into [[Madrid]] in the East.\n\n==Second stage==\nTo better defend the city, Lin Biao redeployed his forces:  the 21st Regiment of the 7th Brigade of the communist Western Manchurian 3rd Division, the 67th Regiment and the 2nd Regiment of the Artillery Brigade of the Northern Manchurian 7th Division entered the city to boost the defense, the 55th Regiment and the 58th Regiment of the 19th Brigade of the communist Wan Yi (\u4e07\u6bc5) Column was deployed in southern suburb, the [[Shandong]] 1st Division and 2nd Division were deployed in the northwestern suburb, the 7th Brigade and the 10th Brigade of the Western Manchurian 3rd Division were deployed in the eastern suburb, and 359th Brigade stationed at [[Gongzhuling]] as reserve.  The 7th Brigade and the 8th Brigade of the communist Southern Manchurian 3rd Column had also successfully severed the nationalist supply line between [[Changtu]] and [[Kaiyuan, Liaoning]], thus slowed down the nationalist push on the city.  To distract nationalist forces elsewhere and preventing them from reinforcing their comrades-in-arms attacking Siping, other communist units launched separate attacks on the nationalist positions, and by April 18, all of the final nationalist strongholds in Changchun region fell into the enemy hands, and on April 25, [[Qiqihar]] fell into the enemy hands, and finally on April 28, all of the final nationalist strongholds in the [[Harbin]] region fell into the enemy hands.  However, such success only strengthened Chiang Kai-shek's resolve to take Changchun after Siping.\n\nAfter the initial success of repelling the nationalist attack, the communist high command became overconfident and daydreamed that within ten days, the communist defenders of Siping would leave the city and annihilate the elite nationalist [[New 1st Army]].  On April 28, 1946, the communist high command telegraphed the entire communist force defending the city by praising them for their success in defending Siping and hoped that they would continue their effort for the final victory, turning [[Siping (city)|Siping]] into another [[Madrid]].  Lin Biao was well aware that the communist force at the time was not capable of fighting with the New 1st Army face to face, and telegraphed back on April 29, claiming that it was impossible to annihilate the New 1st Army at Siping, though this elite nationalist force would definitely be annihilated in [[Northeast China]], it was not the time when defending Siping.  However, the unscathed large communist force in other areas was quite capable of badly mauling the exhausted New 1st Army after the fierce battles at Siping in an ambush at the favorable terrain and under the cover of darkness and bad weather, and such ambush was planned later on the presumed nationalist attack on Changchun.  Du Yuming, the brilliant nationalist commander would not provide the enemy with such opportunity they wanted and thus would consequently foil the enemy's hope by successfully convincing Chiang Kai-shek instead of immediately continuing to take Changchun after taking Siping as originally planned, the exhausted nationalists would stop at Siping regroup and re-supply, hence avoiding any possible ambush or counterattacks by the enemy.\n\nConfident that the nationalists would be able to completely annihilate the communist enemy and would be able to first take Northeast China and then the entire [[China]] afterward, on April 30, 1946, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] turned down [[George Marshall]]'s peace proposal that was agreed by the communists and neutral political parties in [[China]], and both the nationalists and the communists realized that any gains in the following peace negotiations would come from the victories in the battlefield.  On April 1, Mao Zedong telegrammed Lin Biao, giving the latter the following orders:  First, Lin Biao would have the overall control of the communist political and military power in Northeast China and if help was needed, [[Gao Gang]] would be sent.  Second, the nationalists had turned down the [[George Marshall]]'s peace proposal that was agreed by the communists and neutral political parties and insisted on taking Changchun, so Siping and [[Benxi]] must be held to the end so that the enemy (nationalists) would exhaust its supplies and ammunitions to the point that it would take at least six months to resupply, and thus providing time for us (communists) to strengthen ourselves (communists) at Changchun and [[Harbin]] for better positions in the peace negotiation followed.  Third, concentrating our (communist) force to achieve victory.\n\nAfter setbacks outside Siping, the nationalists believed that the situation in Northeast China depended on the successful capture of the city, and after Siping was taken from the enemy, the overall situation for the nationalist in Northeast China would immediately be improved significantly, and thus the city must be taken at all costs.  The elite nationalist New 6th Army under the command of [[Liao Yaoxiang]] (\u5ed6\u8000\u6e58) was first airlifted by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] to Northeast China, and made its move to Siping from [[Kaiyuan, Liaoning]], [[Xifeng County, Liaoning]], and the Town of [[Yehe Nara]] (Ye He Zhen, \u53f6\u8d6b\u9547).  With the arrival of new reinforcements, the nationalists planned to concentrate their forces to take Siping and then take the city of Eternal Auspiciousness (Yong Ji, \u6c38\u5409) and Changchun. In preparation, the 14th Division and the 22nd Division of the nationalist New 6th Army was deployed to [[Kaiyuan, Liaoning]] from [[Liaoyang]] and [[Benxi]], the nationalist 93rd Army was also deployed to Northeast China from [[Beijing]].  In addition, the nationalist [[air force]] concentrated all of its available aircraft in the region to support the offensive on the ground.\n\n==Third stage==\nOn May 15, Du Yuming gave the order to launch a general assault on Siping and declared to his men that the city must be taken this time.  The nationalist assault came in three fronts:  the 88th Division and the New 6th Army of the nationalist right front would attack the enemy's left flank, targeting cities including [[Gongzhuling]], [[Meihekou]], [[Changchun]] and Qitamu (\u5176\u5854\u6728).  The [[New 1st Army]]  on the nationalist central front would directly attack city and then would take [[Shuangcheng]] and [[Dehui]] after taking Siping, and continue its push to the regions north of the [[Songhua River]].  Two divisions of the 71st Army on the nationalist left front would attack the enemy's right flank, targeting Zheng Family's Village (Zheng Jia Tun, \u90d1\u5bb6\u5c6f) and [[Shuangcheng]].  On May 15, 1946, with ten times numerical superiority and additional technical superiority, the nationalist 50th Division at the left flank of the nationalist central front launched its fierce attacks under air cover and air support on the peak # 258 held by the enemy, located to the east of Siping and south of Hafu (\u54c8\u798f).  After severe casualties, the enemy was forced to give up peak # 258.\n\nOn May 17, Du Yuming ordered the nationalist 195th Division in reserve into action and soon took Hafu (\u54c8\u798f), and surrounded the most critical point of defense of the city, the highest point in the east, a hill called Pagoda Mountain (Ta Zi Shan, \u5854\u5b50\u5c71) located 10&nbsp;km to the southeast of the city.  Excited about the progress, Du reported to Chiang Kai-shek that Siping would be taken soon.  Chiang, on the other hands, was not so sure and worried that the nationalist offensive would once more suffer a setback, sent the nationalist Deputy [[Chief of the General Staff (Republic of China)|Chief of the General Staff]] [[Bai Chongxi]] to Northeast China to investigate.  The night Bai reached [[Shenyang]], Bai told Du Yuming that Chiang had felt the battle to capture Siping took too long, and he could not wait any longer.  As long as Siping was captured, the nationalists would be in a better position on the peace negotiation table than the communists and taking Changchun would be after taking Siping.\n\nBoth sides were well aware of the importance of the hill and the nationalists launched multiple assaults on the hill, and all were beaten back by the communist 19th Regiment of the 7th Brigade of the Western Manchurian 3rd Division defending the hill.  The nationalists then concentrated all available firepower to bombard the enemy position with an area around a hundred square metres at the hilltop at a rate of more than 30 rounds per minute, and under the cover of intense artillery shelling, the nationalist New 6th Army under its commander [[Liao Yaoxiang]] (\u5ed6\u8000\u6e58) attacked the hill from three sides in the east, the south, and the west.  After beating back the nationalist attacks for six times, it was obvious reinforcements were needed.  The communist 10th Brigade was ordered to reinforce Pagoda Mountain (Ta Zi Shan, \u5854\u5b50\u5c71) but they were delayed when crossing the [[Liao River]], and this was the most important reason that caused the eventual abandonment of city.\n\nIt was obvious that it would be only a matter of time before the communist stronghold at Pagoda Mountain (Ta Zi Shan, \u5854\u5b50\u5c71) would be taken by the attacking nationalists, and with neither the technical nor the numerical superiority, Lin Biao believed it was much more important to preserve the communist strength for the future and he radioed Mao Zedong on May 18, to report the situation and intention to abandon the city.  After sending the message, Lin Biao ordered a general withdraw without waiting for the Mao's reply, and by midnight, the general withdrawal in was completed in an orderly fashion and in total secrecy.  Next morning, the nationalists entered and secured the city, and only after that did Mao's reply came on May 19, in which Mao finally changed his mind and agreed with Lin Biao.  Had Lin Biao waited, his entire force in the city would be annihilated.\n\n==Outcome==\nThe brilliance of the frontline commanders from both sides was obvious towards the end and after the campaign.  Chiang Kai-shek was overjoyed with the taking of Siping and ordered the nationalists to immediately continue their attack and to take Changchun without a break, so that the enemy would not have the chance to regroup.  Du Yuming, the nationalist frontline commander was well aware that his exhausted force must rest and regroup for sometime before launching anymore attacks on the enemy.  Furthermore, Du and his fellow officers were also keenly aware that the majority of the enemy force in the rural regions was unscathed and was waiting to ambush them out in the open if the exhausted nationalists had ventured into the terrain hostile to the mechanized force.  Du and his officers were determined not to give the enemy the opportunity they had been waiting for, and in a rare example among Chiang's most trusted subordinates, Du Yuming refused to carry out Chiang's order and successfully convinced Chiang to stop the planned offensive to allow the nationalists to consolidate their gains in [[Northeast China]], and thus foiled the enemy's hope of possible ambush.\n\nEqually brilliant, the communist commander Lin Biao dared to ignore Mao Zedong's order and withdrew from the city on his own, thus successfully avoided total annihilation of his defending force by the numerically and technically superior adversary.  However, Lin Biao was more fortunate than his counterpart in that he did not have to convince Mao for his decision and actions because Mao had realized his error and concurred with what Lin Biao's had done.  However, neither Chiang's original plan of continuing to take Changchun nor Mao's original plan of holding Siping had materialized and thus the campaign ended in a stalemate.\n\n==External links==\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20070701054002/http://www.coldwarchina.com/zgyj/zgnz/000714.html (Chinese)\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Chinese battles#Modern China|List of battles of the Chinese Civil War]]\n*[[National Revolutionary Army]]\n*[[History of the People's Liberation Army]]\n*[[Chinese Civil War]]\n{{Chinese Civil War}}\n\n==References==\n*Zhu, Zongzhen and Wang, Chaoguang, ''Liberation War History'', 1st Edition, Social Scientific Literary Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 2000, {{ISBN|7-80149-207-2}} (set)\n*Zhang, Ping, ''History of the Liberation War'', 1st Edition, Chinese Youth Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 1987, {{ISBN|7-5006-0081-X}} (pbk.)\n*Jie, Lifu, ''Records of the Libration War: The Decisive Battle of Two Kinds of Fates'', 1st Edition, [[Hebei]] People's Publishing House in [[Shijiazhuang]], 1990, {{ISBN|7-202-00733-9}} (set)\n*Literary and Historical Research Committee of the [[Anhui]] Committee of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]], ''Liberation War'', 1st Edition, [[Anhui]] People's Publishing House in [[Hefei]], 1987, {{ISBN|7-212-00007-8}}\n*Li, Zuomin, ''Heroic Division and Iron Horse: Records of the Liberation War'', 1st Edition, [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist]] Party History Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 2004, {{ISBN|7-80199-029-3}}\n*Wang, Xingsheng, and Zhang, Jingshan, ''Chinese Liberation War'', 1st Edition, [[People's Liberation Army]] Literature and Art Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 2001, {{ISBN|7-5033-1351-X}} (set)\n*Huang, Youlan, ''History of the Chinese People's Liberation War'', 1st Edition, Archives Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 1992, {{ISBN|7-80019-338-1}}\n*Liu Wusheng, ''From [[Yan'an]] to [[Beijing]]: A Collection of Military Records and Research Publications of Important Campaigns in the Liberation War'', 1st Edition, Central Literary Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 1993, {{ISBN|7-5073-0074-9}}\n*Tang, Yilu and Bi, Jianzhong, ''History of Chinese [[People's Liberation Army]] in Chinese Liberation War'', 1st Edition, Military Scientific Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 1993 &ndash; 1997, {{ISBN|7-80021-719-1}} (Volum 1), 7800219615 (Volum 2), 7800219631 (Volum 3), 7801370937 (Volum 4), and 7801370953 (Volum 5)\n*Harold M.

The nationalists have combined this campaign with the [[Battle of Siping]] as part of the battle, but this was rather misleading since the strategies for both sides were totally different from the strategies in this campaign and unrelated to each other, furthermore, the commanders for both sides in this campaign were completely different from the [[Battle of Siping]].  More importantly, the nationalists in the [[Battle of Siping]] was in name only, because they were former nationalists (mostly [[Warlord era|warlords]] ostensively under nationalist reign) turned Japanese puppet regime forces who rejoined the nationalists after [[World War II]], and the local bandits recruited by the nationalist administrators to fight off communists, since [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s nationalist regime simply did not have the resource to rapidly deploy his forces into the region.  In fact, in the [[Battle of Siping]], Chiang's own force did not even participated in the fights.  This campaign was characterized by the fact that the supreme commanders of both sides had overestimated their strength and set unrealistic goals that could doom their troops in the field, but in both cases, the brilliant frontline commanders on both sides had successfully averted the potential catastrophes by convincing their respective supreme commanders to change their original decisions.\n\n==Prelude==\nAfter the defeat of [[Jinjiatun Campaign]], the nationalists resumed their offensive with vengeance.  In a short period of just two days, the nationalists were able to regroup and re-supply completely, and continued their push toward Siping.  [[Chiang Kai-shek]] was determined to take [[Changchun]] after taking Siping, and [[Mao Zedong]] was equally determined to hold Siping  to the end and prevent the nationalists from taking both Siping and Changchun.  Both sides realized the upcoming campaign would be a difficult one and both sides placed one of their best field commanders in charge:  [[Du Yuming]] for the nationalists and [[Lin Biao]] for the communists.\n\n==Order of battle==\nAttackers: nationalist [[order of battle]]:\n*[[New 1st Army]]\n*[[New 6th Army]]\n*71st Army\n*93rd Army\n*Army-sized 207th Division of the Youth Army\nDefenders: communist [[order of battle]]:\n* Wan Yi (\u4e07\u6bc5) Column\n*Southern Manchurian 3rd Column\n*Western Manchurian 3rd [[Division (military)|Division]]\n*Northern Manchurian 7th Division\n*[[Shandong]] 1st Division\n*[[Shandong]] 2nd Division\n*[[Shandong]] 3rd Division\n*3rd Division of the [[New Fourth Army]]\n*8th [[Brigade]] of the [[New Fourth Army]]\n*359th Brigade\n\n==First stage==\nUnder [[Mao Zedong]]'s strategy, the communists were determined to hold Siping to the end.  In order to fortify the city, everyone was mobilized to build bunkers inside the city, while food, ammunition and other supplies were stacked.  [[Lin Biao]] and personally inspected communist fortifications at important defensive positions such as Pagoda Mountain (Ta Zi Shan, \u5854\u5b50\u5c71) and Three Lines of Groves (San Dao Lin Zi, \u4e09\u9053\u6797\u5b50) with [[Peng Zhen]] in preparation for a prolonged campaign.  Lin Biao also held a conference at Pear Tree (Li Shu, \u68a8\u6811) county to plan the strategy of the defense:  To better coordinate the defense of Siping, the communist formed an urban defense command inside the city headed by the Ma Renxing (\u9a6c\u4ec1\u5174), the commander of the communist 1st Brigade, while the general headquarters retreated to the suburb at Pear Tree (Li Shu, \u68a8\u6811) county.  In order to boost the morale of defenders, a newspaper titled \"Self Defense Newspaper\" was created with Chen Yi (\u9648\u6c82), the deputy director of the political directorate of the communist general headquarters as the chief editor.  The communist decided to deploy only two regiments in the city to check the nationalist attacks while the bulk of their force would be deployed in the rear, in the region between Siping and Pear Tree (Li Shu, \u68a8\u6811) county and the region between Siping and the Eight Sided City (Ba Mian Cheng, \u516b\u9762\u57ce).  Once the attacking nationalists were checked by the defensive force of the city in fortification, the communists would then concentrate their force to strike the weakest nationalist 71st Army.\n\nOn April 17, 1946, nationalist frontline commander Zheng Dongguo (\u90d1\u6d1e\u56fd) and his deputy Liang Huasheng (\u6881\u534e\u76db) moved their headquarters to Twin Temples (Shuang Miao Zi, \u53cc\u5e99\u5b50) and ordered immediately attack on the city.  On April 18, the railways reaching the city was successfully severed.  Two regiments of the 30th Division of the nationalist 71st Army under the command of Chen Mingren (\u9648\u660e\u4ec1) attacked the enemy positions from the south from Haifeng Village (Haifeng Tun, \u6d77\u4e30\u5c6f), Pobozi (\u6cca\u8116\u5b50), and Duck Lake Pao (Ya Hu Pao, \u9e2d\u6e56\u6ce1) regions, but were beaten back three time consecutively.  After the initial setback, Zheng Dongguo (\u90d1\u6d1e\u56fd) held a military conference on April 19.  The nationalist army and divisional commanders attending the conference concluded that the front attack on the strongly defended enemy positions was impossible, and attacks from flanks or other weak points must be selected instead in order to achieve successful breakthrough.  The railway junctions that provided the link between the 3rd [[Battalion]] of the communist 1st Regiment and the communist 56th Regiment appeared to be a good point for breakthrough.  After the conference, under the heavy artillery cover, the 30th Division of the nationalist New 1st Army launched its offensive on the junction of the two communist units, and the nationalists had successfully taken the enemy position as expected.  The loss of the position at the railway junction signaled that the defensive force inside the city must be strengthened and Lin Biao immediately did so, and informed the defenders in the city.\n\nThe arrival of the reinforcement greatly boosted the morale of the defenders and the advance guard of the 21st Regiment of the 7th Brigade of the communist Western Manchurian 3rd Division launched a counterassault on the nationalists with the help of other communist units, successfully took back the positions at railway junction previously lost on the same afternoon, while inflicting heavy casualties on the nationalists in the process, and the heavy casualties stopped the offensive of the nationalist 30th Division completely.  After the struggle for Siping had begun, both Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong in their distant headquarters were concerned about the development and both frequently inquired the progress on the battlefield.  Chiang was determined to take Changchun and thus Siping must be taken first to open the path for Changchun, while Mao felt that Siping must be held at all cost and on April 22, Mao telegraphed Lin Biao to order him to hold on and wait for the campaign to turn for the better.  From April 18,  through April 26, 3 divisions from the nationalist New 1st Army and the 71st Army took turns to assault the enemy positions, but were all beaten back by the enemy in favorable terrain.  By the evening of April 26, 1946, heavy casualties forced the offensive of the nationalist 71st Army to a complete stop, while that of the nationalist [[New 1st Army]] was reduced to skirmishes.\n\nAfter failing to make significant progress, the nationalist resorted to artillery to shell the enemy, but resulted in disastrous failure.  The terrain favored the defenders in that there were relatively few artillery positions outside the city for shelling the city, and defenders were well aware these positions.  The nationalists enjoyed numerical superiorities in artillery so these positions were jammed with nationalist batteries.  The enemy defending the city, on the other hand, had fewer artilleries and thus was forced to move around whenever and wherever they were needed, and such frequent and rapid movement to the next new position where artillery support was needed helped the enemy artilleries from being shelled by the nationalist counter-artillery fire.  In contrast, nationalist artillery was the first to fire for most of the time, but after firing, they were not able to move around due to limited positions available and the high concentration of batteries deployed in the few available positions.  As a result, the nationalist batteries became victims of enemy counter-artillery fire and suffered great loss.  When nationalists were forced to withdraw their batteries from the few available artillery positions to avoid losses, the enemy was out of range.  As a result, the attacking nationalists lost the artillery duel.  Mao was happy that the nationalist attack was beaten back again, and on April 27, 1946, telegraphed Lin Biao to praise him and his troop, and asked Lin Biao to deploy one or two more regiments to develop Siping into [[Madrid]] in the East.\n\n==Second stage==\nTo better defend the city, Lin Biao redeployed his forces:  the 21st Regiment of the 7th Brigade of the communist Western Manchurian 3rd Division, the 67th Regiment and the 2nd Regiment of the Artillery Brigade of the Northern Manchurian 7th Division entered the city to boost the defense, the 55th Regiment and the 58th Regiment of the 19th Brigade of the communist Wan Yi (\u4e07\u6bc5) Column was deployed in southern suburb, the [[Shandong]] 1st Division and 2nd Division were deployed in the northwestern suburb, the 7th Brigade and the 10th Brigade of the Western Manchurian 3rd Division were deployed in the eastern suburb, and 359th Brigade stationed at [[Gongzhuling]] as reserve.  The 7th Brigade and the 8th Brigade of the communist Southern Manchurian 3rd Column had also successfully severed the nationalist supply line between [[Changtu]] and [[Kaiyuan, Liaoning]], thus slowed down the nationalist push on the city.  To distract nationalist force elsewhere and preventing them from reinforcing their comrades-in-arms attacking Siping, other communist units launched separate attacks on the nationalist positions, and by April 18, all of the final nationalist strongholds in Changchun region fell into the enemy hands, and on April 25, [[Qiqihar]] fell into the enemy hands, and finally on April 28, all of the final nationalist strongholds in [[Harbin]] region fell into the enemy hands.  However, such success only strengthened Chiang Kai-shek's resolve to take Changchun after Siping.\n\nAfter the initial success of the beating back the nationalist attack, the communist high command became overconfident and daydreamed that within ten days, the communist defenders of Siping would go out of the city and annihilate the elite nationalist [[New 1st Army]].  On April 28, 1946, the communist high command telegraphed the entire communist force defending the city by praising them for their success in defending Siping and hoped that they would continue their effort for the final victory, turning [[Siping (city)|Siping]] into another [[Madrid]].  Lin Biao was well aware that the communist force at the time was not capable of fighting with the New 1st Army face to face, and telegraphed back on April 29, claiming that it was impossible to annihilate the New 1st Army at Siping, though this elite nationalist force would definitely be annihilated in [[Northeast China]], it was not the time when defending Siping.  However, the unscathed large communist force in other areas was quite capable of badly mauling the exhausted New 1st Army after the fierce battles at Siping in an ambush at the favorable terrain and under the cover of darkness and bad weather, and such ambush was planned later on the presumed nationalist attack on Changchun.  Du Yuming, the brilliant nationalist commander would not provide the enemy with such opportunity they wanted and thus would consequently foil the enemy's hope by successfully convincing Chiang Kai-shek instead of immediately continuing to take Changchun after taking Siping as originally planned, the exhausted nationalists would stop at Siping regroup and re-supply, hence avoiding any possible ambush or counterattacks by the enemy.\n\nConfident that the nationalists would be able to completely annihilate the communist enemy and would be able to first take Northeast China and then the entire [[China]] afterward, on April 30, 1946, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] turned down [[George Marshall]]'s peace proposal that was agreed by the communists and neutral political parties in [[China]], and both the nationalists and the communists realized that any gains in the following peace negotiations would come from the victories in the battlefield.  On April 1, Mao Zedong telegrammed Lin Biao, giving the latter the following orders:  First, Lin Biao would have the overall control of the communist political and military power in Northeast China and if help was needed, [[Gao Gang]] would be sent.  Second, the nationalists had turned down the [[George Marshall]]'s peace proposal that was agreed by the communists and neutral political parties and insisted on taking Changchun, so Siping and [[Benxi]] must be held to the end so that the enemy (nationalists) would exhaust its supplies and ammunitions to the point that it would take at least six months to resupply, and thus providing time for us (communists) to strengthen ourselves (communists) at Changchun and [[Harbin]] for better positions in the peace negotiation followed.  Third, concentrating our (communist) force to achieve victory.\n\nAfter setbacks outside the Siping, the nationalists believed that the situation in Northeast China depended the successful taking of the city, and after Siping was taken from the enemy, the overall situation for the nationalist in Northeast China would immediately be improved significantly, and thus the city must be taken at all cost.  The elite nationalist New 6th Army under the command of [[Liao Yaoxiang]] (\u5ed6\u8000\u6e58) was first airlifted by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] to Northeast China, and made its move to Siping from [[Kaiyuan, Liaoning]], [[Xifeng County, Liaoning]], and the Town of [[Yehe Nara]] (Ye He Zhen, \u53f6\u8d6b\u9547).  With the arrival of the new reinforcement, the nationalists planned to concentrate their forces to take Siping and then take the city of Eternal Auspiciousness (Yong Ji, \u6c38\u5409) and Changchun. In preparation, the 14th Division and the 22nd Division of the nationalist New 6th Army was deployed to [[Kaiyuan, Liaoning]] from [[Liaoyang]] and [[Benxi]], the nationalist 93rd Army was also deployed to Northeast China from [[Beijing]].  In addition, the nationalist [[air force]] concentrated all of its available aircraft in the region to support the offensive on the ground.\n\n==Third stage==\nOn May 15, Du Yuming gave the order to launch a general assault on the Siping and declared to his men that the city must be taken this time.  The nationalist assault came in three fronts:  the 88th Division and the New 6th Army of the nationalist right front would attack the enemy's left flank, targeting cities including [[Gongzhuling]], [[Meihekou]], [[Changchun]] and Qitamu (\u5176\u5854\u6728).  The [[New 1st Army]]  on the nationalist central front would directly attack city and then would take [[Shuangcheng]] and [[Dehui]] after taking Siping, and continue its push to the regions north of [[Songhua River]].  Two divisions of the 71st Army on the nationalist left front would attack enemy's right flank, targeting Zheng Family's Village (Zheng Jia Tun, \u90d1\u5bb6\u5c6f) and [[Shuangcheng]].  On May 15, 1946, with 10 times numerical superiority and additional technical superiority, the nationalist 50th Division at the left flank of the nationalist central front launched its fierce attacks under air cover and air support on the peak # 258 held by the enemy, located to the east of Siping and south of Hafu (\u54c8\u798f).  After severe casualties, the enemy was forced to give up peak # 258.\n\nOn May 17, Du Yuming ordered the nationalist 195th Division in reserve into action and soon took Hafu (\u54c8\u798f), and surrounded the most critical point of defense of the city, the highest point in the east, a hill called Pagoda Mountain (Ta Zi Shan, \u5854\u5b50\u5c71) located 10&nbsp;km to the southeast of the city.  Excited about the progress, Du reported to Chiang Kai-shek that Siping would be taken soon.  Chiang, on the other hands, was not so sure and worried that the nationalist offensive would once more suffer a setback, sent the nationalist Deputy [[Chief of the General Staff (Republic of China)|Chief of the General Staff]] [[Bai Chongxi]] to Northeast China to investigate.  The night Bai reached [[Shenyang]], Bai told Du Yuming that Chiang had felt the battle to take Siping took too long, and he could not wait any longer.  As long as Siping was taken, the nationalists would have a better position on the peace negotiation table than their communist enemy and taking Changchun would be after taking Siping.\n\nBoth sides were well aware the importance of the hill and nationalists launched multiple assaults on the hill, and all were beaten back by the communist 19th Regiment of the 7th Brigade of the Western Manchurian 3rd Division defending the hill.  The nationalists then concentrate all available firepower to bombard the enemy position with an area around a hundred square metres at the hilltop at a rate of more than 30 rounds per minute, and the under the cover of intense artillery shelling, the nationalist New 6th Army under its commander [[Liao Yaoxiang]] (\u5ed6\u8000\u6e58) attacked the hill from three sides in the east, the south, and the west.  After beating back nationalist attacks for six times, it was obvious reinforcement was needed.  The communist 10th Brigade was ordered to reinforce Pagoda Mountain (Ta Zi Shan, \u5854\u5b50\u5c71) but they were delayed when crossing the [[Liao River]], and this was the most important reason caused the eventual abandonment of city.\n\nIt was obvious that it would be only a matter of time before the communist stronghold at Pagoda Mountain (Ta Zi Shan, \u5854\u5b50\u5c71) to be taken by the attacking nationalists, and with neither the technical nor the numerical superiority, Lin Biao felt it was much more important to preserve the communist strength for the future and he radioed Mao Zedong on May 18, to report the situation and intention to abandon the city.  After sending the message, Lin Biao ordered a general withdraw without waiting for the Mao's reply, and by midnight, the general withdraw in an orderly fashion was completed in total secrecy.  Next morning, the nationalists entered and secured the city, and only after that did Mao's reply came on May 19, in which Mao finally changed his mind and agreed with Lin Biao.  Had Lin Biao waited, his entire force in the city would be annihilated.\n\n==Outcome==\nThe brilliance of the frontline commanders on both sides was obvious toward the end and after the campaign.  Chiang Kai-shek was overjoyed with the taking of Siping and ordered the nationalists to immediately continue their attack and to take Changchun without a break, so that the enemy would not have the chance to regroup.  Du Yuming, the nationalist frontline commander was well aware that his exhausted force must rest and regroup for sometime before launching anymore attacks on the enemy.  Furthermore, Du and his fellow officers were also keenly aware that the majority of the enemy force in the rural regions was unscathed and was waiting to ambush them out in the open if the exhausted nationalists had ventured into the terrain hostile to the mechanized force.  Du and his officers were determined not to give the enemy the opportunity they had been waiting for, and in a rare example among Chiang's most trusted subordinates, Du Yuming refused to carry out Chiang's order and successfully convinced Chiang to stop the planned offensive to allow the nationalists to consolidate their gains in [[Northeast China]], and thus foiled the enemy's hope of possible ambush.\n\nEqually brilliant, the communist commander Lin Biao dared to ignore Mao Zedong's order and withdrew from the city on his own, thus successfully avoided total annihilation of his defending force by the numerically and technically superior adversary.  However, Lin Biao was more fortunate than his counterpart in that he did not have to convince Mao for his decision and actions because Mao had realized his error and concurred with what Lin Biao's had done.  However, neither Chiang's original plan of continuing to take Changchun nor Mao's original plan of holding Siping had materialized and thus the campaign ended in a stalemate.\n\n==External links==\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20070701054002/http://www.coldwarchina.com/zgyj/zgnz/000714.html (Chinese)\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Chinese battles#Modern China|List of battles of the Chinese Civil War]]\n*[[National Revolutionary Army]]\n*[[History of the People's Liberation Army]]\n*[[Chinese Civil War]]\n{{Chinese Civil War}}\n\n==References==\n*Zhu, Zongzhen and Wang, Chaoguang, ''Liberation War History'', 1st Edition, Social Scientific Literary Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 2000, {{ISBN|7-80149-207-2}} (set)\n*Zhang, Ping, ''History of the Liberation War'', 1st Edition, Chinese Youth Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 1987, {{ISBN|7-5006-0081-X}} (pbk.)\n*Jie, Lifu, ''Records of the Libration War: The Decisive Battle of Two Kinds of Fates'', 1st Edition, [[Hebei]] People's Publishing House in [[Shijiazhuang]], 1990, {{ISBN|7-202-00733-9}} (set)\n*Literary and Historical Research Committee of the [[Anhui]] Committee of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]], ''Liberation War'', 1st Edition, [[Anhui]] People's Publishing House in [[Hefei]], 1987, {{ISBN|7-212-00007-8}}\n*Li, Zuomin, ''Heroic Division and Iron Horse: Records of the Liberation War'', 1st Edition, [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist]] Party History Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 2004, {{ISBN|7-80199-029-3}}\n*Wang, Xingsheng, and Zhang, Jingshan, ''Chinese Liberation War'', 1st Edition, [[People's Liberation Army]] Literature and Art Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 2001, {{ISBN|7-5033-1351-X}} (set)\n*Huang, Youlan, ''History of the Chinese People's Liberation War'', 1st Edition, Archives Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 1992, {{ISBN|7-80019-338-1}}\n*Liu Wusheng, ''From [[Yan'an]] to [[Beijing]]: A Collection of Military Records and Research Publications of Important Campaigns in the Liberation War'', 1st Edition, Central Literary Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 1993, {{ISBN|7-5073-0074-9}}\n*Tang, Yilu and Bi, Jianzhong, ''History of Chinese [[People's Liberation Army]] in Chinese Liberation War'', 1st Edition, Military Scientific Publishing House in [[Beijing]], 1993 &ndash; 1997, {{ISBN|7-80021-719-1}} (Volum 1), 7800219615 (Volum 2), 7800219631 (Volum 3), 7801370937 (Volum 4), and 7801370953 (Volum 5)\n*Harold M.
