Manchester City ended a 44-year wait to win their first Premier League title on goal difference, with [[Sergio Ag\u00fcero]] scoring in the last minute of stoppage time during their dramatic 3\u20132 win over Queens Park Rangers on the final day. Despite being pushed all the way, they won their final six games, while cross-city neighbours Manchester United squandered an eight-point lead in what was largely a trophyless season for [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]]'s men for the first time in six years. Arsenal recovered from a poor start to the season to take third place, while striker Robin van Persie won the [[Professional Footballers' Association|Players' Player of the Year Award]] by scoring 30 goals.\n\nNewcastle finished fifth to qualify for the [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]], recording their first top-six finish in eight years under Alan Pardew, who won the Manager of the Year award. Chelsea suffered their worst season in ten years, finishing sixth with 64 points; [[Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas]], the personal choice for owner [[Roman Abramovich]], was sacked after just nine months with automatic qualification for the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] at risk. Under caretaker manager [[Roberto Di Matteo]], however, they excelled in the cup competitions, winning the FA Cup for the fourth time in six seasons. It was the Champions League, though, in which they stunned everyone, storming their way through each round to reach the final against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]. Pushing the German powerhouse to penalties, they kept the advantage and ultimately won 4\u20133, giving them their first European Cup victory and ensuring they qualified for the elite competition once again; their victory meant that fourth-placed Tottenham had to enter the Europa League and caused [[Harry Redknapp]] to lose his job after three-and-a-half years in charge.\n\nLiverpool were similar to Chelsea for parts of the league, but ultimately worse as they recorded their lowest league finish for 18 years, finishing in eighth place and only edging ninth-placed Fulham on a higher goal difference; their season was marred by striker [[Luis Su\u00e1rez]] being convicted of racially abusing Manchester United defender [[Patrice Evra]] in October. They put this controversy behind them by winning the League Cup, ending five consecutive seasons without winning a trophy. [[Kenny Dalglish]], fabled for his earlier Liverpool managerial reign in the late 1980s, was sacked after just 16 months following a poor finish to the season that saw them pick up just 13 points from 14 games.\n\nFor only the second time in Premier League history, all three promoted teams survived, though all finished in the bottom half. Swansea City were the pundit's choice to be relegated, but they defied their critics with their own unique style of football and claimed shock victories over the likes of Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool to finish a respectable 11th; by the season's end, [[Brendan Rodgers]] was starting to attract the attention of other Premier League teams. Norwich City finished just below them in 12th, impressing on their return to the top flight and also had manager [[Paul Lambert]] attracting the attention of other Premier League clubs. Queens Park Rangers were left needing to rely on other results on the last day to help them survive, though a run of 19 points from their last nine home fixtures played a major part in their survival.\n\nThe sacking of [[Mick McCarthy]] after nearly six years and the appointment of first team coach [[Terry Connor]] effectively ended Wolverhampton Wanderers' three-year spell in the top-flight. With just four points and no wins taken from Connor's final 13 games in charge, they finished bottom of the table. Having been clear of the relegation zone at the start of April, Blackburn Rovers were also undone by poor late-season form; losing eight of their last nine games as growing anger from the supporters toward owners [[Venky's]] and manager [[Steve Kean]] continued. Bolton Wanderers, who coincidentally had been promoted alongside Blackburn in 2001, went down on the last day of the season after a horrible start to the year that saw them bottom for most of the campaign.\n{{:2011\u201312 Premier League}}\nLeading goalscorer: [[Robin van Persie]] (Arsenal) \u2013 30\n\n===Championship===\n{{main|2011\u201312 Football League Championship}}\nA year after suffering heartbreak in the play-off final, an excellent run of 50 points from their remaining 21 games saw Reading crowned divisional champions, earning promotion to the top flight for only the second time in their history. Having been in the top two for the majority of the season, Southampton finished in the runners-up spot to claim their second successive promotion, returning to the Premier League after a seven-year absence as their revival under [[Nigel Adkins]] continued, one year after Norwich won a second successive promotion. West Ham United, who lost out to Southampton on the last day of the season, won promotion via the play-offs, with manager [[Sam Allardyce]] passing his former clubs Blackburn and Bolton on the way up.\n\nDoncaster Rovers' luck finally ran out after four years of operating on the division's lowest budget, and they were relegated in bottom place. 11 years after dropping out of the Premier League, Coventry City finally hit rock bottom as they suffered from an ongoing financial crisis and the loss of several key players pre-season, their never-ending downward spiral culminating in relegation to the third tier for the first time since 1964. Portsmouth fell back into financial difficulties and went into administration for the second time in three seasons, with the resulting ten-point deduction dealing a fatal blow to their survival hopes and sending them down to League One (had it not been for Portsmouth's points deduction, Barnsley would have been the third relegated side).\n{{:2011\u201312 Football League Championship}}\nLeading goalscorer [[Rickie Lambert]] (Southampton) \u2013 27\n\n===League One===\n{{main|2011\u201312 Football League One}}\n[[Chris Powell]]'s first full season in charge of Charlton earned the Addicks promotion at the third time of asking, leading the division for virtually the entire season to win the title with a club record of 101 points. The two Sheffield clubs contested the second automatic promotion spot; United were in the top two for most of the season, but struggled with form after top scorer [[Ched Evans]] was imprisoned for rape, allowing Wednesday to claim second place and a return to the Championship after a two-year absence. It was ultimately to be another Yorkshire side, Huddersfield Town, who were victorious over United in the play-offs, meaning they would be playing in the second tier for the first time since 2001.\n\nAfter equalling their highest league finish last season, the departure of [[Keith Hill (footballer)|Keith Hill]] to Barnsley during the summer meant that Rochdale finished bottom, bringing their long-awaited spell in League One to an end after just two years. Exeter City also failed to build on their near-miss of the previous season's play-offs and finished second bottom, returning to League Two after three years. Chesterfield couldn't adjust to life in the third tier and they too were relegated, despite winning the [[Football League Trophy]]. Wycombe Wanderers, who finished six points behind the Spireites last season, didn't last long either, and they also suffered immediate relegation back to League Two.\n{{:2011\u201312 Football League One}}\nLeading goalscorer: [[Jordan Rhodes]] (Huddersfield) \u2013 36\n\n===League Two===\n{{main|2011\u201312 Football League Two}}\nSwindon Town made an immediate return to League One, as [[Paolo Di Canio]] won the League Two title in his first season as a manager. Shrewsbury took the runners-up spot, going the entire season unbeaten at home and earning veteran manager [[Graham Turner]] his second promotion with the club 33 years after his first.

Manchester City ended a 44-year wait to win their first Premier League title on goal difference, with [[Sergio Ag\u00fcero]] scoring in the last minute of stoppage time during their dramatic 3\u20132 win over Queens Park Rangers on the final day. Despite being pushed all the way, they won their final six games, while cross-city neighbours Manchester United squandered an eight-point lead in what was largely a trophyless season for [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]]'s men for the first time in six years. Arsenal recovered from a poor start to the season to take third place, while striker Robin van Persie won the [[Professional Footballers' Association|Players' Player of the Year Award]] by scoring 30 goals.\n\nNewcastle finished fifth to qualify for the [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]], recording their first top-six finish in eight years under Alan Pardew, who won the Manager of the Year award. Chelsea suffered their worst season in ten years, finishing sixth with 64 points; [[Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas]], the personal choice for owner [[Roman Abramovich]], was sacked after just nine months with automatic qualification for the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] at risk. Under caretaker manager [[Roberto Di Matteo]], however, they excelled in the cup competitions, winning the FA Cup for the fourth time in six seasons. It was the Champions League, though, in which they stunned everyone, storming their way through each round to reach the final against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]. Pushing the German powerhouse to penalties, they kept the advantage and ultimately won 4\u20133, giving them their first European Cup victory and ensuring they qualified for the elite competition once again; their victory meant that fourth-placed Tottenham had to enter the Europa League and caused [[Harry Redknapp]] to lose his job after three-and-a-half years in charge.\n\nLiverpool were similar to Chelsea for parts of the league, but ultimately worse as they recorded their lowest league finish for 18 years, finishing in eighth place and only edging ninth-placed Fulham on a higher goal difference; their season was marred by striker [[Luis Su\u00e1rez]] being convicted of racially abusing Manchester United defender [[Patrice Evra]] in October. They put this controversy behind them by winning the League Cup, ending five consecutive seasons without winning a trophy. [[Kenny Dalglish]], fabled for his earlier Liverpool managerial reign in the late 1980s, was sacked after just 16 months following a poor finish to the season that saw them pick up just 13 points from 14 games.\n\nFor only the second time in Premier League history, all three promoted teams survived, though all finished in the bottom half. Swansea City were the pundit's choice to be relegated, but they defied their critics with their own unique style of football and claimed shock victories over the likes of Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool to finish a respectable 11th; by the season's end, [[Brendan Rodgers]] was starting to attract the attention of other Premier League teams. Norwich City finished just below them in 12th, impressing on their return to the top flight and also had manager [[Paul Lambert]] attracting the attention of other Premier League clubs. Queens Park Rangers were left needing to rely on other results on the last day to help them survive, though a run of 19 points from their last nine home fixtures played a major part in their survival.\n\nThe sacking of [[Mick McCarthy]] after nearly six years and the appointment of first team coach [[Terry Connor]] effectively ended Wolverhampton Wanderers' three-year spell in the top-flight. With just four points and no wins taken from Connor's final 13 games in charge, they finished bottom of the table. Having been clear of the relegation zone at the start of April, Blackburn Rovers were also undone by poor late-season form; losing eight of their last nine games as growing anger from the supporters toward owners [[Venky's]] and manager [[Steve Kean]] continued. Bolton Wanderers, who coincidentally had been promoted alongside Blackburn in 2001, went down on the last day of the season after a horrible start to the year that saw them bottom for most of the campaign.\n{{:2011\u201312 Premier League}}\nLeading goalscorer: [[Robin van Persie]] (Arsenal) \u2013 30\n\n===Championship===\n{{main|2011\u201312 Football League Championship}}\nA year after suffering heartbreak in the play-off final, an excellent run of 50 points from their remaining 21 games saw Reading crowned divisional champions, earning promotion to the top flight for only the second time in their history. Having been in the top two for the majority of the season, Southampton finished in the runners-up spot to claim their second successive promotion, returning to the Premier League after a seven-year absence as their revival under [[Nigel Adkins]] continued, one year after Norwich won a second successive promotion. West Ham United, who lost out to Southampton on the last day of the season, won promotion via the play-offs, with manager [[Sam Allardyce]] passing his former clubs Blackburn and Bolton on the way up.\n\nDoncaster Rovers' luck finally ran out after four years of operating on the division's lowest budget, and they were relegated in bottom place. 11 years after dropping out of the Premier League, Coventry City finally hit rock bottom as they suffered from an ongoing financial crisis and the loss of several key players pre-season, their never-ending downward spiral culminating in relegation to the third tier for the first time since 1964. Portsmouth fell back into financial difficulties and went into administration for the second time in three seasons, with the resulting ten-point deduction dealing a fatal blow to their survival hopes and sending them down to League One (had it not been for Portsmouth's points deduction, Barnsley would have been the third relegated side).\n{{:2011\u201312 Football League Championship}}\nLeading goalscorer [[Rickie Lambert]] (Southampton) \u2013 27\n\n===League One===\n{{main|2011\u201312 Football League One}}\n[[Chris Powell]]'s first full season in charge of Charlton earned the Addicks promotion at the third time of asking, leading the division for virtually the entire season to win the title with a club record of 101 points. The two Sheffield clubs contested the second automatic promotion spot; United were in the top two for most of the season, but struggled with form after top scorer [[Ched Evans]] was imprisoned for rape, allowing Wednesday to claim second place and a return to the Championship after a two-year absence. It was ultimately to be another Yorkshire side, Huddersfield Town, who were victorious over United in the play-offs, meaning they would be playing in the second tier for the first time since 2001.\n\nAfter equalling their highest league finish last season, the departure of [[Keith Hill (footballer)|Keith Hill]] to Barnsley during the summer meant that Rochdale finished bottom, bringing their long-awaited spell in League One to an end after just two years. Exeter City also failed to build on their near-miss of the previous season's play-offs and finished second bottom, returning to League Two after three years. Chesterfield couldn't adjust to life in the third tier and they too were relegated, despite winning the [[Football League Trophy]]. Wycombe Wanderers, who finished six points behind the Spireites last season, didn't last long either, and they also suffered immediate relegation back to League Two.\n{{:2011\u201312 Football League One}}\nLeading goalscorer: [[Jordan Rhodes]] (Huddersfield) \u2013 36\n\n===League Two===\n{{main|2011\u201312 Football League Two}}\nSwindon Town made an immediate return to League One, as [[Paolo Di Canio]] won the League Two title in his first season as a manager. Shrewsbury took the runners-up spot, going the entire season unbeaten at home and earning veteran manager [[Graham Turner]] his second promotion with the club 33 years after his first.

Summers are normally warm in northern areas to hot in southern areas. In summer, the building [[Bermuda High]] pumps warm and sultry air toward the Northeast, and frequent (but brief) thundershowers are common on hot summer days. In winter the subtropical high retreats southeastward, and the polar jet stream moves south bringing colder air masses from up in Canada and more frequent storm systems to the region.

Summers are normally warm in northern areas to hot in southern areas. In summer, the building [[Bermuda High]] pumps warm and sultry air toward the Northeast, and frequent (but brief) thundershowers are common on hot summer days. In winter the subtropical high retreats southeastward, and the polar jet stream moves south bringing colder air masses from up in Canada and more frequent storm systems to the region.

Extreme amounts have been registered at the betting agencies always predicting a large win for the [[Cyprus|Cypriots]], as a result [[UEFA]] is investigating this match and others of [[Ethnikos Achna FC]] for corruption/bribery. [[Club Brugge]] makes a few mistakes as [[Lithuania]]n team [[FK S\u016bduva]] manage to come back to 2-2 after having led 2\u20130, however they then pump up the pace and finally it ends 5\u20132. [[Club Brugge]] goes on into the [[UEFA Cup 2006-07#First round|Uefa Cup First Round]]. Meanwhile, [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] gets drawn into group H of the [[UEFA Champions League 2006-07|UEFA Champions League]] together with [[AC Milan]], [[Lille OSC]] and [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]]. Their first match is scheduled on September 13 at home to [[Lille OSC]].\n*August 25, 2006 - The draw for the [[UEFA Cup 2006-07#First round|Uefa Cup First Round]] is concluded, [[Club Brugge]] gets paired with [[Slovakia]]n champions [[MFK Ru\u017eomberok]], [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]] has to play against [[Celta de Vigo]] from [[Spain]] and [[S.V. Zulte-Waregem|Zulte-Waregem]] faces a long trip to [[Moscow]] to meet up with [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow]]. [[Club Brugge]] and [[S.V. Zulte-Waregem|Zulte-Waregem]] get to play their first match away from home, [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]] starts with hosting the first leg.\n*August 30, 2006 - [[Johan Boskamp]] gets fired as manager of [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]] after only scoring 2 out of 12 in the league and failure to qualify for the [[UEFA Champions League 2006-07|UEFA Champions League]]. The technical director at [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]], [[Michel Preud'homme]], takes over his job.\n\n===September===\n*September 6, 2006 - After the bad start to the [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying]] campaign, [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] now beats [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]] in [[Yerevan]] by a narrow 1-0 margin. [[Daniel Van Buyten]] scores with a well placed header a few minutes before halftime. Belgium played a moderate match with low quality of play, however the abominable state of the field was also a reason for that.\n*September 9, 2006 - In the first division, on matchday 5, leaders [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] lose their perfect record as a late goal by [[R.E. Mouscron]]'s [[Adnan \u0106ustovi\u0107]] ends the game in a 1\u20131 draw. Meanwhile, [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]] win their first match of the season, 1\u20133 away to [[Lierse S.K.]].\n*September 11, 2006 - It is announced that the [[Belgian Supercup]] between league champions [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] and cup winners [[S.V. Zulte-Waregem]], which was originally abandoned at half time due to excessive rain on July 22,  will be replayed on 20 December.\n*September 13, 2006 - [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] has not won their opening match for several years in the [[UEFA Champions League]] and also this year they don't manage to win. Against [[Lille OSC]], the match ends in a 1\u20131 draw as both teams had several chances, Anderlecht mainly in the first half and Lille mainly in the second half.\n*September 14, 2006 - [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow]] is very patient as they wait for good chances to appear against [[S.V. Zulte-Waregem]] in the [[Uefa Cup]] first round match and their tactics seem to pay off as after 90 minutes [[Dmitri Loskov|Loskov]] and [[Branislav Ivanovi\u0107|Ivanovi\u0107]] have set the 2\u20130 on the board. However, in the 94th minute, [[Jonas Vandermarliere]] scores the all important away goal and thereby causes the return match to be very exciting. Meanwhile, [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]] is overrun for 90 minutes at home as they struggle to create any chances against [[Celta de Vigo]], in the end they're lucky to just lose 0-1 and as they leave the field, they are booed by the home crowd. In [[Slovakia]], [[Club Brugge]] struggles in the opening few minutes against [[MFK Ru\u017eomberok]], but then they take over and after a free-kick goal by [[Bo\u0161ko Balaban]] they control the match to prevent the Slovakian team from scoring, in which they succeed to make for a 1\u20130 victory away from home.\n*September 26, 2006 - Again a 1\u20131 draw for [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] in the [[UEFA Champions League]], this time against [[AEK Athens FC]]. Anderlecht took the lead in the first half through [[Nicol\u00e1s Frutos]] but the equaliser followed just minutes later from [[J\u00falio C\u00e9sar da Silva e Souza|J\u00falio C\u00e9sar]].\n*September 28, 2006 - Return matches of the first round of the [[UEFA Cup 2006-07]]: [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]] plays a decent match, but when [[Karel Geraerts]] misses a penalty kick, the morale is gone and eventually [[Celta de Vigo]] wins the return match 3\u20130. Against [[MFK Ru\u017eomberok]], [[Club Brugge]] plays very poorly but eventually they go through after a last minute equaliser by [[Bo\u0161ko Balaban]]. The stunt of the day comes from [[S.V. Zulte-Waregem]] as they beat [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow]] 2\u20130 at home to go through into the group stage.\n*September 30, 2006 - In the first division, joint leaders [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] and [[K.R.C. Genk]] play against each other on the 8th matchday. Anderlecht, at that time recognised by many as the most probable champions for the current season solely on strength of the squad, loses out 1\u20134 on their home ground, where they had not been beaten since February 2005. Genk are the new leaders.\n\n===October===\n*October 3, 2006 - The draw for the [[UEFA Cup 2006-07#Group stage|Uefa Cup 2006-07 Group Stage]] is concluded, with [[Club Brugge]] ending up in group B together with [[Bayer Leverkusen]], [[Be\u015fikta\u015f J.K.|Be\u015fikta\u015f]], [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u015fti|Dinamo Bucharest]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] while [[S.V. Zulte-Waregem]] gets paired with [[Ajax Amsterdam|Ajax]], [[AC Sparta Prague|Sparta Prague]], [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]] and [[FK Austria Wien|Austria Vienna]] in group F.\n*October 6, 2006 - The [[Belgian Football Association|KBVB/URBSFA]] met with representatives of the city of Brussels and together they agreed to renew the contract concerning the [[King Baudouin Stadium]] and extend it to June 30, 2008. As of November 15, 2006 against [[Poland national football team]] on, the [[Belgium national football team|Belgian national football team]] will play in the King Baudouin Stadium again.\n*October 7, 2006 - In the [[2008 UEFA European Football Championship qualifying]] tournament, [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] loses 1\u20130 to [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]] in [[Belgrade]]. In the first half, the Belgians never got into trouble but did not create many chances themselves, while in the second half it was Serbia having control. Serbia scored with more than half an hour to go through [[Nikola \u017digi\u0107]] and Belgium tried to respond, but never managed to score.\n*October 11, 2006 - [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] easily beats [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]] 3\u20130 in [[Anderlecht]]. For the first time since long, the Belgian team manages to score more than one goal when it matters.\n*October 17, 2006 - After a red card for [[Daniele Bonera]] early in the second half, it looked promising for [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] to take some points in the [[UEFA Champions League]] match at home to [[A.C. Milan]]. However they did not manage to score whereas [[Kak\u00e1]] for Milan did with a slightly deviated shot from about 20 meters. The game ended 0\u20131.\n*October 19, 2006 - In the [[UEFA Cup 2006-07]], [[Bayer Leverkusen]] holds [[Club Brugge]] to a 1\u20131 draw in [[Bruges]]. In [[Vienna]], [[S.V. Zulte-Waregem]] beats [[FK Austria Wien|Austria Vienna]] 4\u20131 with the help of three goals from [[Tim Matthys]].\n*October 21\u201322, 2006 - Apart from [[R.A.E.C. Mons|Mons]], who already joined (and got eliminated) in round 4, the other teams from the first division enter the [[Belgian Cup 2006-07|Belgian Cup]] in round 6 during this weekend. [[R. Charleroi S.C.|Charleroi]], [[K.S.K. Beveren|Beveren]] and [[K.S.C. Lokeren Oost-Vlaanderen|Lokeren]] lose to [[K.F.C. V.W. Hamme|Hamme]], [[Lierse S.K.|Lierse]] and [[R. Antwerp F.C.|Antwerp]] respectively on Saturday. While on Sunday [[Cercle Brugge K.S.V.|Cercle Brugge]] and [[F.C. Molenbeek Brussels Strombeek|Brussels]], two more teams from the first division are also knocked out of the cup. With one more match of [[Belgian Cup 2006-07#Round 6|Round 6]] to go, only 11 remain. For [[Lierse S.K.|Lierse]], this is the very first victory this season, as they are in last position in the league with just 1 point out of 9 matches.\n*October 25, 2006 - [[Y.R. K.V. Mechelen|KV Mechelen]] is the last team to qualify for [[Belgian Cup 2006-07#Round 7|Round 7]] of the Belgian Cup as they beat [[K.F.C. Germinal Beerschot|Germinal Beerschot]] 1-0 after [[extra time]].\n*October 26, 2006 - The draw for the [[Belgian Cup 2006-07#Round 7|Seventh Round]] of the Belgian Cup yields no big clashes as [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]] and [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] get home matches against [[Belgian Second Division|Division Two]] teams and [[K.R.C. Genk|RC Genk]] and [[Club Brugge]] also play at home against [[R.E. Mouscron|Mouscron]] and [[K.V.C. Westerlo|Westerlo]].\n*October 29, 2006 - After losing in the cup to [[Belgian Second Division]] team [[R. Antwerp F.C.|Antwerp]] and a 4\u20131 loss to [[K.V.C. Westerlo|Westerlo]] in the league, [[Ari\u00ebl Jacobs]] is the second manager to get fired this season as he is sacked by [[K.S.C. Lokeren Oost-Vlaanderen|Lokeren]].\n\n===November===\n*November 1, 2006 - [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] loses by a harsh 4-1 margin to [[A.C. Milan]] in the [[UEFA Champions League]], although they had numerous chances in the last half-hour to come back to 3\u20132. [[Kak\u00e1]] had however already scored three times.\n*November 2, 2006 - In the [[UEFA Cup 2006-07]], [[S.V. Zulte-Waregem]] surprises again as they now beat [[AC Sparta Prague|Sparta Prague]] 3\u20131, they are now almost sure of qualification for the next round. Meanwhile, [[Club Brugge]] has a lot of work to do as they lose 3\u20131 to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.]].\n*November 7, 2006 - [[Thomas Caers]] quits his job as manager of [[K. Sint-Truidense V.V.|Sint Truiden]] as he feels the players don't respect him anymore after a series of bad results. Meanwhile, rumours are saying [[K.S.C. Lokeren Oost-Vlaanderen|Lokeren]] could soon be giving [[Slavoljub Muslin]] a contract with the club as their new manager.\n*November 13, 2006 - [[Ren\u00e9 Trost]] agrees with the management of [[Lierse S.K.|Lierse]] to split up and each go their own way. At that time Lierse is in last position, with two points out of 12 matches.\n*November 15, 2006 - The [[Belgium national football team|Belgian national football team]] loses their home match against [[Poland national football team|Poland]] 0-1 after a shameful performance in which they did not succeed in creating good scoring opportunities.\n*November 21, 2006 - [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] is eliminated from the [[UEFA Champions League]] as they play 2\u20132 in [[Lyon]] against [[Lille OSC]], but since [[AEK Athens FC]] beats [[A.C. Milan]] 1\u20130 at home, [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] can only finish third at best.\n*November 22, 2006 - [[Lierse S.K.|Lierse]] finds a new manager as [[Kjetil Rekdal]] is contracted to try to keep the team in the first division. In [[K. Sint-Truidense V.V.|Sint Truiden]], [[Henk Houwaart]] is the new manager.\n*November 23, 2006 - In the [[UEFA Cup 2006-07]], [[Club Brugge]] plays a good match but is not rewarded as they only manage a 1\u20131 draw against [[Romania]]n side [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u015fti|Dinamo Bucharest]], they now need to win against [[Be\u015fikta\u015f J.K.]] to have a chance of progressing. In [[Barcelona]], [[S.V. Zulte-Waregem]] gets beaten 6-2 by [[RCD Espanyol de Barcelona|Espanyol]] and so they lose their good looking goal difference, however they still have a good chance of progressing.\n*November 26, 2006 - [[K.S.C. Lokeren Oost-Vlaanderen|Lokeren]] announces that [[Slavoljub Muslin]] will sign a contract as the new manager within the next few days.\n*November 29, 2006 - [[Be\u015fikta\u015f J.K.]] beats [[Club Brugge]] 2-1 and thereby eliminates [[Club Brugge]] in [[UEFA Cup 2006-07]].\n*November 30, 2006 - Because of beneficial results in Group F, [[S.V. Zulte-Waregem]] is qualified for the next round of the [[UEFA Cup 2006-07]] without playing themselves. They still have one match left in the group fase against [[Ajax Amsterdam]].\n\n===December===\n*December 6, 2006 - In the [[UEFA Champions League]], [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] gives away a 2\u20130 lead to [[AEK Athens FC]] to end in a 2\u20132 draw, but would have been eliminated from European football entirely anyway, as [[Lille OSC]] beat [[A.C. Milan]] in [[Milan]] 2\u20130.\n*December 8, 2006 - [[K.R.C. Genk|RC Genk]], already sure of being in first position at the half way mark of the championship after only 15 out of 34 matches, lose their first match of the season in and against [[R. Charleroi S.C.|Charleroi]] by a big 4-1 margin. However they still have six-point lead over [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] and seven over [[Club Brugge]], although both those teams have played one match less and so could close in to three and four points respectively with just one match to go before the winter-break.\n*December 13, 2006 - [[Ajax Amsterdam]] is too strong for [[S.V. Zulte-Waregem]], as Zulte-Waregem gets beaten 0\u20133 at home in the [[UEFA Cup 2006-07]]. However they were already sure of qualifying for the next round.\n*December 15, 2006 - In the draw for the [[UEFA Cup 2006-07]] Round of 32, [[S.V. Zulte-Waregem]] gets paired with [[Newcastle United F.C.]].

Lokeren Oost-Vlaanderen|Lokeren]] 1\u20130. [[K.R.C. Genk|RC Genk]] end 2006 with 40 points, three points clear of [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] and seven over [[K.A.A. Gent|Gent]]. [[Club Brugge]] are nine points behind but have one match left against their city-rivals, [[Cercle Brugge K.S.V.|Cercle Brugge]].\n*December 20, 2006 - The [[Belgian Supercup]], originally planned to be played on July 22 but abandoned due to heavy rainfall, is won by title-holders [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] as they beat cup-winners [[S.V. Zulte-Waregem]] 3\u20131.\n\n===January===\n*January 13\u201314, 2007 - In the [[Belgian Cup 2006-07#Round 7|Seventh Round]] of the Belgian Cup, the current top five of the first division all progress to the quarter-finals together with [[Belgian Second Division|Division Two]] teams [[Royal Antwerp FC|Antwerp]], [[K.V.

Mechelen|KV Mechelen]].\n*January 17, 2007 - [[Mbark Boussoufa]] of [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] wins the [[Belgian Golden Shoe]] as the best player of 2006. In the second half of the 2005\u201306 season he helped [[K.A.A. Gent|Gent]] to reach fourth place and in the current season he was one of the better players of Anderlecht. Anderlecht is the big winner of the day as the top-4 of the overall rankings are also Anderlecht players and all the side awards go to Anderlecht players, [[Daniel Z\u00edtka]] is chosen to be the best goalkeeper, [[Lucas Biglia]] wins the rookie of the year award and [[Mohammed Tchit\u00e9]] scored the most beautiful goal of the season, away to [[F.C. Molenbeek Brussels Strombeek|Brussels]].\n*January 28, 2007 - After losing 0\u20131 at home to [[K.S.V. Roeselare|Roeselare]] and a disappointing fifth place in the standings, 12 points behind leaders [[K.R.C. Genk|RC Genk]], [[Emilio Ferrera]] is fired as manager of [[Club Brugge K.V.|Club Brugge]]. [[Cedomir Janevski]] is appointed as the new manager.\n\n===February===\n* February 1, 2007 - At [[R.E. Mouscron]], [[Gil Vandenbrouck]] resigns after disappointing results and is given another job at the club. [[Ari\u00ebl Jacobs]] is the new coach.\n* February 7, 2007 - The [[Belgium national football team|Red Devils]] lose 0\u20132 at home to the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]]. Yet another bad result makes few people in Belgium believe that Belgium will not lose to [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in March.\n* February 14, 2007 - In [[Ghent]], [[S.V. Zulte-Waregem|Zulte-Waregem]] loses 3\u20131 to [[Newcastle United]] in the first leg of their Round of 32 match in the [[UEFA Cup 2006-07|UEFA Cup]].\n* February 22, 2007 - In the [[UEFA Cup 2006-07|UEFA Cup]], the return match in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] is also lost as [[Obafemi Martins]] scores the only goal in the match for [[Newcastle United]]. [[S.V. Zulte-Waregem|Zulte-Waregem]] is now eliminated, but after beating [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv Moscow]], [[AC Sparta Prague|Sparta Prague]] and [[FK Austria Wien|Austria Wien]] and having played against [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol Barcelona]], [[Ajax Amsterdam]] and [[Newcastle United]] the team has had an exceptional season in Europe, certainly as it's only their second season back at the highest level of Belgian football. With this elimination, all Belgian teams have now been eliminated from European football.\n* February 28, 2007 - In the league, [[K.R.C. Genk]] and [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] seem to be the two only teams left able to win the title as they are several points ahead of [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]] and [[K.A.A. Gent]] in third and fourth. With a match Genk vs. Anderlecht coming up in two weeks which will probably be decisive for the championship, all eyes are on the quarter-finals of the [[Belgian Cup 2006-07|Belgian Cup]] match between both those teams. In a very exciting match, Anderlecht wins the first leg 0\u20131 in [[Genk]] and has a good chance to progress to the semi-finals. The other quarter finals: [[Royal Antwerp FC|Antwerp]] 0-1 [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]], [[Club Brugge]] 2-1 [[K.V. Kortrijk|Kortrijk]] and [[K.A.A. Gent|Gent]] 2-1 [[Y.R. K.V. Mechelen|KV Mechelen]].\n\n===March===\n* March 11, 2007 \u2013 The [[K.R.C. Genk|Genk]]\u2013[[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] match ends in a 1\u20131 draw, meaning Genk retains its two-point lead over Anderlecht with nine matches to play.\n* March 24, 2007 \u2013 Belgium loses 4\u20130 to [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in a qualifying match for Euro 2008. After a scoreless first-half, [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] and [[Ricardo Quaresma]] lead Portugal to victory.\n\n==National team==\nAfter failing to qualify for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], Belgium will attempt to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 2008]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Date\n!Venue\n!Location\n!Opponents\n!Score<ref name=\"Belgian Team's score given first\">Belgian Team's score given first</ref>\n!Competition\n!Belgium scorers\n!Match Report\n|-\n|August 16, 2006\n|[[Constant Vanden Stock Stadium]] (H)\n|{{flagicon|Belgium}} [[Anderlecht]]\n|{{fb|KAZ}}\n|0-0\n|ECQ\n|\n|[http://www.uefa.com/competitions/EURO/FixturesResults/Round=2241/match=83750/index.html Uefa.com]\n|-\n|September 6, 2006\n|[[Hrazdan Stadium]] (A)\n|{{flagicon|Armenia}} [[Yerevan]]\n|{{fb|ARM}}\n|1-0\n|ECQ\n|[[Daniel Van Buyten|Van Buyten]] 41'\n|[http://www.uefa.com/Competitions/EURO/FixturesResults/Round=2241/match=83756/index.html Uefa.com]\n|-\n|October 7, 2006\n|[[Stadion Crvena Zvezda]] (A)\n|{{flagicon|Serbia}} [[Belgrade]]\n|{{fb|SRB}}\n|0-1\n|ECQ\n|\n|[http://www.uefa.com/competitions/EURO/FixturesResults/Round=2241/match=83759/index.html Uefa.com]\n|-\n|October 11, 2006\n|[[Constant Vanden Stock Stadium]] (H)\n|{{flagicon|Belgium}} [[Anderlecht]]\n|{{fb|AZE}}\n|3-0\n|ECQ\n|[[Timmy Simons|Simons]] 24' ([[Penalty kick (association football)|pen]])<br>[[Kevin Vandenbergh|Vandenbergh]] 47'<br>[[Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 (Belgian footballer)|Demb\u00e9l\u00e9]] 82'\n|[http://www.uefa.com/competitions/EURO/FixturesResults/Round=2241/match=83761/index.html Uefa.com]\n|-\n|November 15, 2006\n|[[King Baudouin Stadium]] (H)\n|{{flagicon|Belgium}} [[Brussels]]\n|{{fb|POL}}\n|0-1\n|ECQ\n|\n|[http://www.uefa.com/competitions/EURO/FixturesResults/Round=2241/match=83767/index.html Uefa.com]\n|-\n|February 7, 2007\n|[[King Baudouin Stadium]] (H)\n|{{flagicon|Belgium}} [[Brussels]]\n|{{fb|CZE}}\n|0-2\n|F\n|\n|[http://www.uefa.com/competitions/euro/news/kind=1/newsid=504778.html Uefa.com]\n|-\n|March 24, 2007\n|[[Est\u00e1dio Jos\u00e9 Alvalade]] (A)\n|{{flagicon|Portugal}} [[Lisbon]]\n|{{fb|POR}}\n|0-4\n|ECQ\n|\n|[https://web.archive.org/web/20080616094231/http://www.euro2008.uefa.com/tournament/qualifying/matches/match=83769/index.html Uefa.com]\n|-\n|June 2, 2007\n|[[King Baudouin Stadium]] (H)\n|{{flagicon|Belgium}} [[Brussels]]\n|{{fb|POR}}\n|1-2\n|ECQ\n|[[Marouane Fellaini|Fellaini]] 55'\n|[https://web.archive.org/web/20080616094152/http://www.euro2008.uefa.com/tournament/qualifying/matches/match=83777/index.html Uefa.com]\n|-\n|June 6, 2007\n|[[Helsinki Olympic Stadium|Olympic Stadium]] (A)\n|{{flagicon|Finland}} [[Helsinki]]\n|{{fb|FIN}}\n|0-2\n|ECQ\n|\n|[https://web.archive.org/web/20080616131459/http://www.euro2008.uefa.com/tournament/qualifying/matches/match=83778/index.html Uefa.com]\n|}\n\n;Key\n* H = Home match\n* A = Away match\n* F = Friendly\n* ECQ = European Championship Qualifier\n\n==European club results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Date\n!Team\n!Competition\n!Round\n!Leg\n!Opponent\n!Location\n!Score<ref name=\"Belgian Team's score given first\"/>\n|-\n|July 13\n|[[K.S.V.

Roeselare|Roeselare]] is the first Belgian team to compete in Europe this season as they take part in the first qualifying round of the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]. They win their very first European match ever, 2\u20131, against Macedonian side [[FK Vardar|Vardar]] away in [[Skopje]].\n* July 16, 2006 \u2013 In the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup 2006|Intertoto Cup]], [[K.A.A. Gent|Gent]] loses the first leg of their tie with [[Grasshopper Club Z\u00fcrich|Grasshoppers Z\u00fcrich]] 2\u20131 in [[Z\u00fcrich]].\n* July 22, 2006 - The [[Belgian Supercup]], played at the [[Constant Vanden Stock Stadium]] between [[R.S.C.

Steaua looks to become the opponent as they already have won the first leg of the match over Gorica.\n* July 28, 2006 - [[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]] and Roeselare receive their opponents in the second qualifying round of the UEFA Cup: [[FK S\u016bduva]] and [[Ethnikos Achna FC|Ethnikos Achna]], respectively.\n* July 28, 2006 - Club Brugge plays Gent in the first match of the domestic season, winning 5\u20130.\n* July 29, 2006 - Official start of the first division with five more matches.\n\n===August===\n*August 2, 2006 - It is now sure that [[FC Steaua Bucure\u015fti|Steaua Bucure\u015fti]] will be the opponent of [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]] in the third qualification round of the [[UEFA Champions League 2006-07|Champions League]] as they also beat [[ND Gorica]] in the return leg.\n*August 9, 2006 - [[FC Steaua Bucure\u015fti|Steaua Bucure\u015fti]], the opponent of [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]] in the third qualification round of the [[UEFA Champions League 2006-07|Champions League]], has the best chances of progressing to the group stage as the first leg ends 2-2 at [[Stade Maurice Dufrasne|Sclessin]] in [[Li\u00e8ge]].\n*August 10, 2006 - Both [[FK S\u016bduva]] and [[Ethnikos Achna FC]] prove not strong enough for [[Club Brugge]] and [[K.S.V. Roeselare]] respectively as both [[Belgium|Belgian]] teams win their first match. [[K.S.V. Roeselare]] won 2-1 at home and still has some work to do in the return leg in [[Cyprus]] while [[Club Brugge]] looks sure of progressing to the [[UEFA Cup 2006-07|UEFA Cup]] proper as they won 0-2 away from home in [[S\u016bduva stadium]], [[Marijampol\u0117]].\n*August 16, 2006 - The match between [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] and [[Kazakhstan national football team|Kazakhstan]] (141st on the [[FIFA World Rankings]]) ends in a scoreless 0-0 draw and just like the previous qualifying campaigns the \"Red Devils\" don't get off to a good start.\n*August 23, 2006 - [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]] start good in the second leg of the third qualification round of the [[UEFA Champions League 2006-07|Champions League]] as they score after three minutes already away to [[FC Steaua Bucure\u015fti|Steaua Bucure\u015fti]] and almost manage to make it 0-2 a few minutes later. However, in the end they lose 2-1 after two goals from [[Valentin Badea]]. As a result, Standard Li\u00e8ge will play in the [[UEFA Cup 2006-07|UEFA Cup]]. Elsewhere, [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] loses to [[Real Madrid]] 2-1 in the [[Trofeo Santiago Bernab\u00e9u]]. In Belgium, the [[Belgian Second Division|Second Division 2006-07]] season gets underway, as the first matchday is played.\n*August 24, 2006 - In the heat of [[Cyprus]], [[K.S.V. Roeselare]] gets stomped 5-0 by [[Ethnikos Achna FC]] and so loses its 2-1 lead from the first leg, they are eliminated from European football for this season. Extreme amounts have been registered at the betting agencies always predicting a large win for the [[Cyprus|Cypriots]], as a result [[UEFA]] is investigating this match and others of [[Ethnikos Achna FC]] for corruption/bribery. [[Club Brugge]] makes a few mistakes as [[Lithuania]]n team [[FK S\u016bduva]] manage to come back to 2-2 after having led 2-0, however they then pump up the pace and finally it ends 5-2. [[Club Brugge]] goes on into the [[UEFA Cup 2006-07#First round|Uefa Cup First Round]]. Meanwhile, [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] gets drawn into group H of the [[UEFA Champions League 2006-07|UEFA Champions League]] together with [[AC Milan]], [[Lille OSC]] and [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]]. Their first match is scheduled on September 13 at home to [[Lille OSC]].\n*August 25, 2006 - The draw for the [[UEFA Cup 2006-07#First round|Uefa Cup First Round]] is concluded, [[Club Brugge]] gets paired with [[Slovakia]]n champions [[MFK Ru\u017eomberok]], [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]] has to play against [[Celta de Vigo]] from [[Spain]] and [[S.V. Zulte-Waregem|Zulte-Waregem]] faces a long trip to [[Moscow]] to meet up with [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow]]. [[Club Brugge]] and [[S.V. Zulte-Waregem|Zulte-Waregem]] get to play their first match away from home, [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]] starts with hosting the first leg.\n*August 30, 2006 - [[Johan Boskamp]] gets fired as manager of [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]] after only scoring 2 out of 12 in the league and failure to qualify for the [[UEFA Champions League 2006-07|UEFA Champions League]]. The technical director at [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]], [[Michel Preud'homme]], takes over his job.\n\n===September===\n*September 6, 2006 - After the bad start to the [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying]] campaign, [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] now beats [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]] in [[Yerevan]] by a narrow 1-0 margin. [[Daniel Van Buyten]] scores with a well placed header a few minutes before halftime. Belgium played a moderate match with low quality of play, however the abominable state of the field was also a reason for that.\n*September 9, 2006 - In the first division, on matchday 5, leaders [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] lose their perfect record as a late goal by [[R.E. Mouscron]]'s [[Adnan \u0106ustovi\u0107]] ends the game in a 1-1 draw. Meanwhile, [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]] win their first match of the season, 1-3 away to [[Lierse S.K.]].\n*September 11, 2006 - It is announced that the [[Belgian Supercup]] between league champions [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] and cup winners [[S.V. Zulte-Waregem]], which was originally abandoned at half time due to excessive rain on July 22,  will be replayed on 20 December.\n*September 13, 2006 - [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] has not won their opening match for several years in the [[UEFA Champions League]] and also this year they don't manage to win. Against [[Lille OSC]], the match ends in a 1-1 draw as both teams had several chances, Anderlecht mainly in the first half and Lille mainly in the second half.\n*September 14, 2006 - [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow]] is very patient as they wait for good chances to appear against [[S.V. Zulte-Waregem]] in the [[Uefa Cup]] first round match and their tactics seem to pay off as after 90 minutes [[Dmitri Loskov|Loskov]] and [[Branislav Ivanovi\u0107|Ivanovi\u0107]] have set the 2-0 on the board. However, in the 94th minute, [[Jonas Vandermarliere]] scores the all important away goal and thereby causes the return match to be very exciting. Meanwhile, [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]] is overrun for 90 minutes at home as they struggle to create any chances against [[Celta de Vigo]], in the end they're lucky to just lose 0-1 and as they leave the field, they are booed by the home crowd. In [[Slovakia]], [[Club Brugge]] struggles in the opening few minutes against [[MFK Ru\u017eomberok]], but then they take over and after a free-kick goal by [[Bo\u0161ko Balaban]] they control the match to prevent the Slovakian team from scoring, in which they succeed to make for a 1-0 victory away from home.\n*September 26, 2006 - Again a 1-1 draw for [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] in the [[UEFA Champions League]], this time against [[AEK Athens FC]]. Anderlecht took the lead in the first half through [[Nicol\u00e1s Frutos]] but the equaliser followed just minutes later from [[J\u00falio C\u00e9sar da Silva e Souza|J\u00falio C\u00e9sar]].\n*September 28, 2006 - Return matches of the first round of the [[UEFA Cup 2006-07]]: [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]] plays a decent match, but when [[Karel Geraerts]] misses a penalty kick, the morale is gone and eventually [[Celta de Vigo]] wins the return match 3-0. Against [[MFK Ru\u017eomberok]], [[Club Brugge]] plays very poorly but eventually they go through after a last minute equaliser by [[Bo\u0161ko Balaban]]. The stunt of the day comes from [[S.V. Zulte-Waregem]] as they beat [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow]] 2-0 at home to go through into the group stage.\n*September 30, 2006 - In the first division, joint leaders [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] and [[K.R.C. Genk]] play against each other on the 8th matchday. Anderlecht, at that time recognised by many as the most probable champions for the current season solely on strength of the squad, loses out 1-4 on their home ground, where they had not been beaten since February 2005. Genk are the new leaders.\n\n===October===\n*October 3, 2006 - The draw for the [[UEFA Cup 2006-07#Group stage|Uefa Cup 2006-07 Group Stage]] is concluded, with [[Club Brugge]] ending up in group B together with [[Bayer Leverkusen]], [[Be\u015fikta\u015f J.K.|Be\u015fikta\u015f]], [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u015fti|Dinamo Bucharest]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] while [[S.V. Zulte-Waregem]] gets paired with [[Ajax Amsterdam|Ajax]], [[AC Sparta Prague|Sparta Prague]], [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]] and [[FK Austria Wien|Austria Vienna]] in group F.\n*October 6, 2006 - The [[Belgian Football Association|KBVB/URBSFA]] met with representatives of the city of Brussels and together they agreed to renew the contract concerning the [[King Baudouin Stadium]] and extend it to June 30, 2008. As of November 15, 2006 against [[Poland national football team]] on, the [[Belgium national football team|Belgian national football team]] will play in the King Baudouin Stadium again.\n*October 7, 2006 - In the [[2008 UEFA European Football Championship qualifying]] tournament, [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] loses 1-0 to [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]] in [[Belgrade]]. In the first half, the Belgians never got into trouble but did not create many chances themselves, while in the second half it was Serbia having control. Serbia scored with more than half an hour to go through [[Nikola \u017digi\u0107]] and Belgium tried to respond, but never managed to score.\n*October 11, 2006 - [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] easily beats [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]] 3-0 in [[Anderlecht]]. For the first time since long, the Belgian team manages to score more than one goal when it matters.\n*October 17, 2006 - After a red card for [[Daniele Bonera]] early in the second half, it looked promising for [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] to take some points in the [[UEFA Champions League]] match at home to [[A.C. Milan]]. However they did not manage to score whereas [[Kak\u00e1]] for Milan did with a slightly deviated shot from about 20 meters. The game ended 0-1.\n*October 19, 2006 - In the [[UEFA Cup 2006-07]], [[Bayer Leverkusen]] holds [[Club Brugge]] to a 1-1 draw in [[Bruges]]. In [[Vienna]], [[S.V. Zulte-Waregem]] beats [[FK Austria Wien|Austria Vienna]] 4-1 with the help of three goals from [[Tim Matthys]].\n*October 21\u201322, 2006 - Apart from [[R.A.E.C. Mons|Mons]], who already joined (and got eliminated) in round 4, the other teams from the first division enter the [[Belgian Cup 2006-07|Belgian Cup]] in round 6 during this weekend. [[R. Charleroi S.C.|Charleroi]], [[K.S.K. Beveren|Beveren]] and [[K.S.C. Lokeren Oost-Vlaanderen|Lokeren]] lose to [[K.F.C. V.W. Hamme|Hamme]], [[Lierse S.K.|Lierse]] and [[R. Antwerp F.C.|Antwerp]] respectively on Saturday. While on Sunday [[Cercle Brugge K.S.V.|Cercle Brugge]] and [[F.C. Molenbeek Brussels Strombeek|Brussels]], two more teams from the first division are also knocked out of the cup. With one more match of [[Belgian Cup 2006-07#Round 6|Round 6]] to go, only 11 remain. For [[Lierse S.K.|Lierse]], this is the very first victory this season, as they are in last position in the league with just 1 point out of 9 matches.\n*October 25, 2006 - [[Y.R. K.V. Mechelen|KV Mechelen]] is the last team to qualify for [[Belgian Cup 2006-07#Round 7|Round 7]] of the Belgian Cup as they beat [[K.F.C. Germinal Beerschot|Germinal Beerschot]] 1-0 after [[extra time]].\n*October 26, 2006 - The draw for the [[Belgian Cup 2006-07#Round 7|Seventh Round]] of the Belgian Cup yields no big clashes as [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]] and [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] get home matches against [[Belgian Second Division|Division Two]] teams and [[K.R.C. Genk|RC Genk]] and [[Club Brugge]] also play at home against [[R.E. Mouscron|Mouscron]] and [[K.V.C. Westerlo|Westerlo]].\n*October 29, 2006 - After losing in the cup to [[Belgian Second Division]] team [[R. Antwerp F.C.|Antwerp]] and a 4-1 loss to [[K.V.C. Westerlo|Westerlo]] in the league, [[Ari\u00ebl Jacobs]] is the second manager to get fired this season as he is sacked by [[K.S.C. Lokeren Oost-Vlaanderen|Lokeren]].\n\n===November===\n*November 1, 2006 - [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] loses by a harsh 4-1 margin to [[A.C. Milan]] in the [[UEFA Champions League]], although they had numerous chances in the last half-hour to come back to 3-2. [[Kak\u00e1]] had however already scored three times.\n*November 2, 2006 - In the [[UEFA Cup 2006-07]], [[S.V. Zulte-Waregem]] surprises again as they now beat [[AC Sparta Prague|Sparta Prague]] 3-1, they are now almost sure of qualification for the next round. Meanwhile, [[Club Brugge]] has a lot of work to do as they lose 3-1 to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.]].\n*November 7, 2006 - [[Thomas Caers]] quits his job as manager of [[K. Sint-Truidense V.V.|Sint Truiden]] as he feels the players don't respect him anymore after a series of bad results. Meanwhile, rumours are saying [[K.S.C. Lokeren Oost-Vlaanderen|Lokeren]] could soon be giving [[Slavoljub Muslin]] a contract with the club as their new manager.\n*November 13, 2006 - [[Ren\u00e9 Trost]] agrees with the management of [[Lierse S.K.|Lierse]] to split up and each go their own way. At that time Lierse is in last position, with two points out of 12 matches.\n*November 15, 2006 - The [[Belgium national football team|Belgian national football team]] loses their home match against [[Poland national football team|Poland]] 0-1 after a shameful performance in which they did not succeed in creating good scoring opportunities.\n*November 21, 2006 - [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] is eliminated from the [[UEFA Champions League]] as they play 2-2 in [[Lyon]] against [[Lille OSC]], but since [[AEK Athens FC]] beats [[A.C. Milan]] 1-0 at home, [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] can only finish third at best.\n*November 22, 2006 - [[Lierse S.K.|Lierse]] finds a new manager as [[Kjetil Rekdal]] is contracted to try to keep the team in the first division. In [[K. Sint-Truidense V.V.|Sint Truiden]], [[Henk Houwaart]] is the new manager.\n*November 23, 2006 - In the [[UEFA Cup 2006-07]], [[Club Brugge]] plays a good match but is not rewarded as they only manage a 1-1 draw against [[Romania]]n side [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u015fti|Dinamo Bucharest]], they now need to win against [[Be\u015fikta\u015f J.K.]] to have a chance of progressing. In [[Barcelona]], [[S.V. Zulte-Waregem]] gets beaten 6-2 by [[RCD Espanyol de Barcelona|Espanyol]] and so they lose their good looking goal difference, however they still have a good chance of progressing.\n*November 26, 2006 - [[K.S.C. Lokeren Oost-Vlaanderen|Lokeren]] announces that [[Slavoljub Muslin]] will sign a contract as the new manager within the next few days.\n*November 29, 2006 - [[Be\u015fikta\u015f J.K.]] beats [[Club Brugge]] 2-1 and thereby eliminates [[Club Brugge]] in [[UEFA Cup 2006-07]].\n*November 30, 2006 - Because of beneficial results in Group F, [[S.V. Zulte-Waregem]] is qualified for the next round of the [[UEFA Cup 2006-07]] without playing themselves. They still have one match left in the group fase against [[Ajax Amsterdam]].\n\n===December===\n*December 6, 2006 - In the [[UEFA Champions League]], [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] gives away a 2-0 lead to [[AEK Athens FC]] to end in a 2-2 draw, but would have been eliminated from European football entirely anyway, as [[Lille OSC]] beat [[A.C. Milan]] in [[Milan]] 2-0.\n*December 8, 2006 - [[K.R.C. Genk|RC Genk]], already sure of being in first position at the half way mark of the championship after only 15 out of 34 matches, lose their first match of the season in and against [[R. Charleroi S.C.|Charleroi]] by a big 4-1 margin. However they still have six-point lead over [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] and seven over [[Club Brugge]], although both those teams have played one match less and so could close in to three and four points respectively with just one match to go before the winter-break.\n*December 13, 2006 - [[Ajax Amsterdam]] is too strong for [[S.V. Zulte-Waregem]], as Zulte-Waregem gets beaten 0-3 at home in the [[UEFA Cup 2006-07]]. However they were already sure of qualifying for the next round.\n*December 15, 2006 - In the draw for the [[UEFA Cup 2006-07]] Round of 32, [[S.V. Zulte-Waregem]] gets paired with [[Newcastle United F.C.]]. The winner of the tie will face the winner of [[Fenerbah\u00e7e S.K.|Fenerbah\u00e7e]] against [[AZ Alkmaar]].\n*December 16, 2006 - On the last day of the first half of the season, [[Lierse S.K.|Lierse]] finally manages to win a match in the first division as they beat [[K.S.C. Lokeren Oost-Vlaanderen|Lokeren]] 1-0. [[K.R.C. Genk|RC Genk]] end 2006 with 40 points, three points clear of [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] and seven over [[K.A.A. Gent|Gent]]. [[Club Brugge]] are nine points behind but have one match left against their city-rivals, [[Cercle Brugge K.S.V.|Cercle Brugge]].\n*December 20, 2006 - The [[Belgian Supercup]], originally planned to be played on July 22 but abandoned due to heavy rainfall, is won by title-holders [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] as they beat cup-winners [[S.V. Zulte-Waregem]] 3-1.\n\n===January===\n*January 13\u201314, 2007 - In the [[Belgian Cup 2006-07#Round 7|Seventh Round]] of the Belgian Cup, the current top five of the first division all progress to the quarter-finals together with [[Belgian Second Division|Division Two]] teams [[Royal Antwerp FC|Antwerp]], [[K.V. Kortrijk|Kortrijk]] and [[Y.R. K.V. Mechelen|KV Mechelen]].\n*January 17, 2007 - [[K.R.C. Genk|RC Genk]] and [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] are paired together in the draw for the quarter finals for the [[Belgian Cup 2006-07|Belgian Cup]]. The other matches are [[Royal Antwerp FC|Antwerp]] vs. [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]], [[Club Brugge]] vs. [[K.V. Kortrijk|Kortrijk]] and [[K.A.A. Gent|Gent]] vs. [[Y.R. K.V. Mechelen|KV Mechelen]].\n*January 17, 2007 - [[Mbark Boussoufa]] of [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] wins the [[Belgian Golden Shoe]] as the best player of 2006. In the second half of the 2005-06 season he helped [[K.A.A. Gent|Gent]] to reach fourth place and in the current season he was one of the better players of Anderlecht. Anderlecht is the big winner of the day as the top-4 of the overall rankings are also Anderlecht players and all the side awards go to Anderlecht players, [[Daniel Z\u00edtka]] is chosen to be the best goalkeeper, [[Lucas Biglia]] wins the rookie of the year award and [[Mohammed Tchit\u00e9]] scored the most beautiful goal of the season, away to [[F.C. Molenbeek Brussels Strombeek|Brussels]].\n*January 28, 2007 - After losing 0-1 at home to [[K.S.V. Roeselare|Roeselare]] and a disappointing fifth place in the standings, 12 points behind leaders [[K.R.C. Genk|RC Genk]], [[Emilio Ferrera]] is fired as manager of [[Club Brugge K.V.|Club Brugge]]. [[Cedomir Janevski]] is appointed as the new manager.\n\n===February===\n* February 1, 2007 - At [[R.E. Mouscron]], [[Gil Vandenbrouck]] resigns after disappointing results and is given another job at the club. [[Ari\u00ebl Jacobs]] is the new coach.\n* February 7, 2007 - The [[Belgium national football team|Red Devils]] lose 0-2 at home to the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]]. Yet another bad result makes few people in Belgium believe that Belgium will not lose to [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in March.\n* February 14, 2007 - In [[Ghent]], [[S.V. Zulte-Waregem|Zulte-Waregem]] loses 3-1 to [[Newcastle United]] in the first leg of their Round of 32 match in the [[UEFA Cup 2006-07|UEFA Cup]].\n* February 22, 2007 - In the [[UEFA Cup 2006-07|UEFA Cup]], the return match in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] is also lost as [[Obafemi Martins]] scores the only goal in the match for [[Newcastle United]]. [[S.V. Zulte-Waregem|Zulte-Waregem]] is now eliminated, but after beating [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv Moscow]], [[AC Sparta Prague|Sparta Prague]] and [[FK Austria Wien|Austria Wien]] and having played against [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol Barcelona]], [[Ajax Amsterdam]] and [[Newcastle United]] the team has had an exceptional season in Europe, certainly as it's only their second season back at the highest level of Belgian football. With this elimination, all Belgian teams have now been eliminated from European football.\n* February 28, 2007 - In the league, [[K.R.C. Genk]] and [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]] seem to be the two only teams left able to win the title as they are several points ahead of [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]] and [[K.A.A. Gent]] in third and fourth. With a match Genk vs. Anderlecht coming up in two weeks which will probably be decisive for the championship, all eyes are on the quarter-finals of the [[Belgian Cup 2006-07|Belgian Cup]] match between both those teams. In a very exciting match, Anderlecht wins the first leg 0-1 in [[Genk]] and has a good chance to progress to the semi-finals. The other quarter finals: [[Royal Antwerp FC|Antwerp]] 0-1 [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]], [[Club Brugge]] 2-1 [[K.V. Kortrijk|Kortrijk]] and [[K.A.A. Gent|Gent]] 2-1 [[Y.R. K.V. Mechelen|KV Mechelen]].\n\n===March===\n* March 11, 2007 \u2013 The [[K.R.C. Genk|Genk]]\u2013[[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] match ends in a 1\u20131 draw, meaning Genk retains its two-point lead over Anderlecht with nine matches to play.\n* March 24, 2007 \u2013 Belgium loses 4\u20130 to [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in a qualifying match for Euro 2008. After a scoreless first-half, [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] and [[Ricardo Quaresma]] lead Portugal to victory.\n\n==National team==\nAfter failing to qualify for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], Belgium will attempt to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 2008]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Date\n!Venue\n!Location\n!Opponents\n!Score<ref name=\"Belgian Team's score given first\">Belgian Team's score given first</ref>\n!Competition\n!Belgium scorers\n!Match Report\n|-\n|August 16, 2006\n|[[Constant Vanden Stock Stadium]] (H)\n|{{flagicon|Belgium}} [[Anderlecht]]\n|{{fb|KAZ}}\n|0-0\n|ECQ\n|\n|[http://www.uefa.com/competitions/EURO/FixturesResults/Round=2241/match=83750/index.html Uefa.com]\n|-\n|September 6, 2006\n|[[Hrazdan Stadium]] (A)\n|{{flagicon|Armenia}} [[Yerevan]]\n|{{fb|ARM}}\n|1-0\n|ECQ\n|[[Daniel Van Buyten|Van Buyten]] 41'\n|[http://www.uefa.com/Competitions/EURO/FixturesResults/Round=2241/match=83756/index.html Uefa.com]\n|-\n|October 7, 2006\n|[[Stadion Crvena Zvezda]] (A)\n|{{flagicon|Serbia}} [[Belgrade]]\n|{{fb|SRB}}\n|0-1\n|ECQ\n|\n|[http://www.uefa.com/competitions/EURO/FixturesResults/Round=2241/match=83759/index.html Uefa.com]\n|-\n|October 11, 2006\n|[[Constant Vanden Stock Stadium]] (H)\n|{{flagicon|Belgium}} [[Anderlecht]]\n|{{fb|AZE}}\n|3-0\n|ECQ\n|[[Timmy Simons|Simons]] 24' ([[Penalty kick (association football)|pen]])<br>[[Kevin Vandenbergh|Vandenbergh]] 47'<br>[[Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 (Belgian footballer)|Demb\u00e9l\u00e9]] 82'\n|[http://www.uefa.com/competitions/EURO/FixturesResults/Round=2241/match=83761/index.html Uefa.com]\n|-\n|November 15, 2006\n|[[King Baudouin Stadium]] (H)\n|{{flagicon|Belgium}} [[Brussels]]\n|{{fb|POL}}\n|0-1\n|ECQ\n|\n|[http://www.uefa.com/competitions/EURO/FixturesResults/Round=2241/match=83767/index.html Uefa.com]\n|-\n|February 7, 2007\n|[[King Baudouin Stadium]] (H)\n|{{flagicon|Belgium}} [[Brussels]]\n|{{fb|CZE}}\n|0-2\n|F\n|\n|[http://www.uefa.com/competitions/euro/news/kind=1/newsid=504778.html Uefa.com]\n|-\n|March 24, 2007\n|[[Est\u00e1dio Jos\u00e9 Alvalade]] (A)\n|{{flagicon|Portugal}} [[Lisbon]]\n|{{fb|POR}}\n|0-4\n|ECQ\n|\n|[https://web.archive.org/web/20080616094231/http://www.euro2008.uefa.com/tournament/qualifying/matches/match=83769/index.html Uefa.com]\n|-\n|June 2, 2007\n|[[King Baudouin Stadium]] (H)\n|{{flagicon|Belgium}} [[Brussels]]\n|{{fb|POR}}\n|1-2\n|ECQ\n|[[Marouane Fellaini|Fellaini]] 55'\n|[https://web.archive.org/web/20080616094152/http://www.euro2008.uefa.com/tournament/qualifying/matches/match=83777/index.html Uefa.com]\n|-\n|June 6, 2007\n|[[Helsinki Olympic Stadium|Olympic Stadium]] (A)\n|{{flagicon|Finland}} [[Helsinki]]\n|{{fb|FIN}}\n|0-2\n|ECQ\n|\n|[https://web.archive.org/web/20080616131459/http://www.euro2008.uefa.com/tournament/qualifying/matches/match=83778/index.html Uefa.com]\n|}\n\n;Key\n* H = Home match\n* A = Away match\n* F = Friendly\n* ECQ = European Championship Qualifier\n\n==European club results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Date\n!Team\n!Competition\n!Round\n!Leg\n!Opponent\n!Location\n!Score<ref name=\"Belgian Team's score given first\"/>\n|-\n|July 13\n|[[K.S.V.

Lasting only two months, it saw no bills pass and was not even regarded as a Parliament by its contemporaries. However, for this legislative failure it has been known to posterity as the '''Addled Parliament'''.\n\nJames had struggled with debt ever since he came to the English throne. The failure of the [[Blessed Parliament]] of 1604\u20131610 to, in its six-year sitting, rescue the king from his mounting debt or allow James to unite his two kingdoms, had left him bitter with the body. The four-year hiatus between Parliaments saw the royal debt and deficit grow further, despite the best efforts of [[Lord High Treasurer|Treasurer]] [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]. The failure of the last and most lucrative financial expedient of this period, a foreign [[dowry]] from the marriage of his heir-apparent, finally convinced James to recall Parliament in early 1614.\n\nThe Parliament got off to a bad start, with poor choices made for the king's representatives in Parliament. Rumours of conspiracy to manage (the \"undertaking\") or pack the Parliament for the king, though not based in fact, spread quickly. This spreading, and the ultimate failure of Parliament, has been generally attributed to the scheming of the crypto-Catholic [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]], though this has met with some recent skepticism. Parliament opened on 5 April and, despite the king's wishes it would be a \"Parliament of Love\", flung itself immediately into the controversy over the conspiracies, splitting parliament and leading to the exclusion of one alleged packer. However, by late April, Parliament had moved on to a familiar controversy, that of [[impositions]]. The Commons were pitted against the Lords, culminating in a controversy over an unrestrained speech by one prelate.\n\nJames grew impatient with the Parliamentary proceedings. He issued an ultimatum to Parliament, but they treated it irreverently. Insult was added to injury by belligerent, and supposedly threatening, attacks on him from the Commons. On the advice of Northampton, James dissolved Parliament on 7 June, and had 4 MPs sent to the [[Tower of London]]. James fell back on new financial expedients to settle his still-growing debt, to little success. Historiographically, historians are divided between the [[Whig history|Whiggish]] view of the Parliament as anticipating the constitutional disputes of future Parliaments, and the revisionist view of it as a conflict primarily concerned with James's finances.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|James VI and I|Blessed Parliament}}\n[[File:King James I of England and VI of Scotland in Parliament by Renold or Reginold Elstrack (Elstracke).jpg|left|thumb|King James I at the [[Blessed Parliament]] on 5 November 1605.]]\nJames VI and I (1566\u20141625) ascended to the [[List of Scottish monarchs|Scottish throne]] on 24 July 1567, and subsequently to the [[List of English monarchs|English and Irish throne]] on 24 March 1603, becoming [[Union of the Crowns|the first king of to reign over both kingdoms]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} James inherited, with the latter throne, a national debt to the amount of \u00a3300,000, a sum that only increased during his reign. By 1608, it stood at \u00a31 million. During his predecessor [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s reign, the inward revenue of the crown had steadily fallen; taxes from customs and land were consistently undervalued and the parliamentary subsidies steadily shrank.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It did not help that James reigned as \"one of the most extravagant kings\" in English history.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} In peace, Elizabeth's yearly expenditure never rose above \u00a3300,000; almost immediately after James took the throne, it was at \u00a3400,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} James had instituted various extra-parliamentary plans to recuperate this lost income, but these drew controversy from Parliament, and James still wanted for money.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} Moreover, James was keen to not be \"a husband to two wives\" as king, and to unite his crowns as one kingdom of [[Great Britain]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} urging for \"one king, one people, and one law\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}{{efn|In James's original Latinism: \"{{lang|la|Unus Rex}} [...] {{lang|la|Unus Grex}} and {{lang|la|Una Lex}}\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}}} The first parliament of his reign, also known as the [[Blessed Parliament]], was called in 1604; it took seven years, five sessions, to dissolve,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} ending unsatisfactorily for both king and Parliament.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In the first session, many members feared James's unification would lead to the dissolution of the English [[Common Law]] system. Though many prominent politicians publicly praised the idea of unification and MPs accepted a commission to investigate the union early in the Parliament, James's proposed title of the \"king of Great Britain\" was rejected outright.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} Between the first and second sessions, in October 1604, James assumed the title of king of Great Britain by proclamation, controversially circumventing parliament. Unification was not brought up at the second session, to ease outrage,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but by the end of the third session, unification faced such criticism from MPs that it was practically dead.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It was quietly dropped from discussion in the fourth and fifth sessions.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}\n\n[[File:John de Critz Robert Cecil Earl of Salisbury c 1608.png||thumb|[[Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury]] depicted with the white staff of a [[Lord High Treasurer]]. Though a skilled treasurer, Salisbury was unable to significantly reduce the Crown's crippling debt before his death.]]\n\nDuring the Blessed Parliament, Parliament's own aims saw similar disappointment; James rebuffed the proposed institution of Puritan ecclesiastical reforms,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} and failed to address two unpopular royal rights, [[purveyance]] and [[wardship]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{efn|According to Andrew Thrush of [[The History of Parliament]]: \"Purveyance was the right of the Crown to take up provisions for the royal household at below the market rate, while wardship was the right of the Crown to manage the estates of minors whose lands were held of the king.\"{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}}} In the second session, Parliament granted the king a subsidy of between \u00a3400,000, keen to exhibit royal support in the wake of the Gunpowder Plot,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but thanks to the reduction of these subsidies under Elizabeth, this was rather less than the king desired.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} After a 3-year delay between sessions due to plague, the fourth session was called in February 1610, and was dominated by financial discussion. [[Lord High Treasurer]], [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]] proposed the [[Great Contract]]: a financial plan wherein Parliament would grant the Crown \u00a3600,000 immediately (to pay off its debts) and an annual stipend of \u00a3200,000 thereafter; in return, the king was to abolish ten feudal dues, among them, purveyance. After much haggling, in which wardship was added to the abolished dues, the session adjourned on a supportive note. However, when the next session began, support had cooled. Parliament refused to give an annual stipend unless James abolished [[impositions]] as well.{{efn|Impositions were bringing James \u00a370,000 annually, a sum which would only expand with the growth of trade in England.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} By the 1630s, they were bringing the king \u00a3218,000 a year.{{sfn|Russell|1990|p=39}}}} Parliament did give the king an immediate subsidy, but the proposed \u00a3600,000 was reduced to a mere \u00a3100,000. By 6 November 1610, James demanded the other \u00a3500,000 and conditioned that, if impositions were to be abolished, Parliament would have to supply him with another equally lucrative income source. Parliament were outraged, and the Contract was abandoned three days later. Though both Salisbury and James made conciliatory gestures in hope of securing at least some more funds, James grew impatient, and proclaimed the dissolution of the Parliament on 31 December.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} James's first parliament ended on a bitter note; \"your greatest error\", he chastised Salisbury, \"hath been that ye ever expected to draw honey out of gall.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=80}}\n\nAfter this, James was not keen to call another Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} However, without Parliament to raise taxes, the treasury was forced to find new ways to raise money.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In 1611, the City of London loaned the Crown \u00a3100,000; \u00a360,000 was extracted from [[Louis XIII of France|the King of France]] over debts accumulated in the reign of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]; [[Honour#Awards|honours]] were sold to wealthy gentlemen, raising \u00a390,000; a forced loan was levied on nearly 10,000 people.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|pp=148\u2013149}} Yet, after the death of Treasurer Salisbury in 1612, England's finances still remained destitute, with a debt of \u00a3500,000 and annual [[Deficit spending|deficit]] of \u00a3160,000.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|p=149}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=10}} However, James's principal fiscal expedient was to be the marriage of his [[heir-apparent]], [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry, Prince of Wales]], for which he expected a sizeable [[dowry]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} not to mention a foreign ally.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=84}} James went into talks with several Catholic countries but, in late 1612, aged 18, Henry contracted [[typhoid]] and abruptly died;{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=85}} [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]], newly heir-apparent at age 12, took his place in the negotiations. Negotiations were going most promisingly in France, where a marriage of Prince Charles to the 6-year-old Princess [[Christine of France]] promised a healthy sum of \u00a3240,000, almost halving James's debt.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} However, by early 1614, France's internal religious strife had intensified to such a point that civil war seemed imminent, so negotiations stalled on the French side; James grew impatient.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James's financial insecurity had only worsened in this time, the debt now at \u00a3680,000 and the deficit, \u00a3200,000.{{sfn|Roberts|1985|p=7}} Conspicuous consumption had raised yearly expenditure to an unsustainable \u00a3522,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|pp=98-99}} A group of advisors, led by the [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Earls of Suffolk]] and [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]], encouraged the king to call a Parliament to raise funds, convincing James \"that\"\u2014as he later put it\u2014\"my subjects did not hate me, which I know I had not deserved.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Northampton stringently opposed the meeting,{{sfn|Cramsie|2002|p=135}} but, reluctantly, James summoned another parliament in 1614.

Crewe was a surprising choice for Speaker, a last minute pick with little previous experience.]]\n\nThe Privy Council as a whole was not optimistic about the upcoming parliament. Two of the king's closest advisors were unavailable, the Earls of Salisbury was dead and Northampton was ill.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Even Suffolk and Pembroke were clueless of any way to prevent Parliament from bringing up thorny issues such as impositions again.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} However, two Councillors were to provide advice to the king over his new parliament, which would prove significant.{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] [[Sir Francis Bacon]], who had been among the most vocal in favour of calling Parliament, blamed Salisbury entirely for the failure of the previous Parliament, privately holding the treasurer had undermine his early career. He asserted that Salisbury's deal-making had been the king's downfall, and that the king should approach Parliament as a king, rather than a merchant, and request subsidies on the basis of the Commons' good will.{{sfn|Willson|1967|pp=344-345}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|pp=251-252}} Bacon added to this that the king should employ patronage to win over the men of Parliament to his side.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=489}} [[Sir Henry Neville (died 1615)|Sir Henry Neville]] offered advice to the king on how to warm relations with Parliament, which he accepted amiably.{{sfn|Thrush|2010c}} But Neville's more portentous offer was that of an \"undertaking\", whereby Neville and a group of \"patriots\" would arrange to manage the Parliament in James's favour, in return for the office of Secretary of State.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} James rejected the undertaking derisively, and no such conspiracy was ever arranged,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} but rumours of its actual occurrence spread quickly in the lead up to Parliament.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=491}}\n\nMPs later accused James of trying to [[wikt:pack#Verb|pack]] the Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=52}} Indeed, Bacon had plainly advised the king on the \"placing of persons well-affected and discreet\" in Parliament,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=221-222}} and James was unapologetic in packing the Irish Parliament the previous year.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93}}{{efn|James attempted to pack the Irish Parliament of 1613 with Protestants by adding a 84 new seats to the former 148 that election: 38 represented tiny or as-yet nonexistent settlements in the Protestant [[Ulster plantation]]. The election came out with a Protestant majority of 32. James insisted he was within his royal right in doing this and mocked the Parliament's grievances.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93, 148}}}} A large number of Crown officials found themselves in this Parliament,{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} four Privy Councillors found themselves in the Commons, alongside plenty of Crown lawyers.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=222-223}} Though there is no evidence that the Crown sought to pack Parliament with easily controlled and pacified MPs, James certainly promoted the election of those sympathetic to the crown.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} However, there is more evidence of an apathy towards this Parliament from the [[Privy Council]]: few of the expected preparations were made.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} After some Byzantine wrangling in which another better-qualified candidate was dropped, [[Ranulph Crewe]], MP for the [[rotten borough|government-controlled borough]] of [[Saltash (UK Parliament constituency)|Saltash]], was chosen at the last minute to be the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]].{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=41-42}} This was a surprising choice: Crewe's previous experience in Parliament was limited to a short stint as an MP in 1597-98 and an appearance on two minor legal counsels, his legal career was no more impressive.{{sfn|Hunneyball|2010}} Crewe's inexperience precipitated the disorder that Parliament would quickly descend into.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=169}} James's most senior representative in the House of Commons, [[Ralph Winwood]], [[Secretary of State (England)|Secretary of State]], was announced similarly late. Though an spirited official and zealous Puritan, Winwood had no parliamentary experience at all and was a terse, unlikable figure.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=345}} The new House of Commons as a whole was not especially inexperienced,{{efn|61% (281 out of 464) of the members had never sat in Parliament before, a little above the Elizabethan average of 50%, but perfectly reasonable given the decade interval between elections.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=55}}}} but it was the inexperience of his most important officials and advisors that was to damage the king.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=55}}\n\n===Opening: Rumours and conspiracy===\n[[File:Henry Neville 1599.jpg|right|thumb|The first six weeks of Parliament were marked by the suspicion of an \"undertaking\", headed by Sir [[Henry Neville (died 1615)|Henry Neville]].]]\nParliament opened on 5 April 1614.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James opened the Parliament with the wish that it would come to be known as the \"Parliament of Love\", and that king and Parliament would go on in harmony and understanding.{{sfn|Mondi|2007|p=153}} His opening speech was divided into three sections: the first ({{lang|la|bona animi}}), decrying the growth of Catholicism and imploring the harsher enforcement of existing laws;{{efn|According to Thomas L. Moir, this aspect of James's speech \"displayed one of those flashes of visions which occasionally revealed his intellectual capacity.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=81}} Rather than demand the institution of new anti-Catholic legislature, James contended that persecution only aided the Catholic cause, and that, as Protestantism was correct, it could reject Catholicism for its own fallacies.

For a brief period, this investigation dominated the Commons: Parry was suspended from the House and, passingly, from his Chancellorship. For many in parliament, this seemed evidence enough that the king's officials had attempted to pack Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}}{{sfn|Seddon|2008}} Simultaneously, a [[Parliamentary committees of the United Kingdom|committee]] to inquire into the alleged undertaking was launched, though this proved less fruitful. The committee's chairman returned on 2 May; he spoke confusingly, but concluded against the existence of any undertaking. However, Parliamentary provocateur [[John Hoskins (poet)|John Hoskins]] demanded further investigation, which the House accepted.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} On 14 May, the inquiry ended; after six weeks of Parliament, rumours of an undertaking had finally been dismissed.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} By the end, resentment against the undertakers had dissipated, and Neville was never suspended for his part, but rather met with commendation from Parliament in his efforts to remedy its grievances.

After five days of debate, the Lords returned with their formal refusal of such a conference, meeting with the astonishment of many.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} The Lords had voted 39 to 30 against it, carried by the near unanimity of the Bishops against this conference.{{efn|Out of the 17 [[prelates]] who voted, all but one opposed the conference, namely the old-fashioned [[Archbishop of York]], [[Tobias Matthew]].{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}}}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}} [[Lord Spiritual]] [[Richard Neile]], who was one of the most vocal opponents of the conference,{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=116-117}} added insult to injury with a sharp speech condemning the petitioners.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}} The remarks made in this speech, known as the \"{{lang|la|Noli me tangere}} speech\", have been described by one historian as \"the most dangerous words used in the reign [of James I] by any politician.\"{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=228}} The Commons refused to conduct any more business until Neile had been punished for this affront.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} Though the Commons received a tearful apology and retraction from the Bishop on 30 May, they were unsatisfied, and doubled down on their demands of disciplinary action.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=130-131}} By the end of May, as Moir put it, \"the temper of the Commons had reached a fever pitch\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=132}} and leadership had broke down in this intractable atmosphere.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=132-133}} No punishment for Neile, however, ever materialised, and the king was growing impatient with Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\n===Finale: James grows impatient===\n[[File:Henry Howard Earl of Northampton circle of Gheeraerts.JPG|right|thumb|[[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton]]'s wishes were finally fulfilled on his deathbed, as James dissolved Parliament and looked for Spanish support.]]\n\nParliament was adjourned on 1 June for [[Ascension Day]], reconvening again on 3 June.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} When the Commons met on this day, they received an ultimatum from the king: unless Parliament agreed to grant him a financial supply soon, he would dissolve Parliament on 9 June.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=136}} James expected this to shock the Commons into pursuing his aims, but instead it only entrenched the opposition further into its obstinancy. Many felt this demand was a bluff; the king was stil deeply in debt, and Parliamentary subsidies still seemed his only way out. Instead of effecting any subsidies, the Commons attacked the king mercilessly. His Court, especially the Scots, were accused of extravagance, suggesting the king would have no need for impositions or subsidies if not for these subjects.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} As one member memorably pronounced, James's courtiers were \"spaniels to the king and wolves to the people\".{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=229}} Possibly encouraged by Northampton,{{efn|According to Moir, Hoskins here \"seems to have been simply the tool of the pro-Spanish [i.e. Northampton's] interests.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} The provocative historical reference was submitted by two of Northampton's lackeys: [[Lionel Sharpe]], [[Sir Charles Cornwallis (diplomat)|Sir Charles Cornwallis]].

Either way, Hoskins was promised the protection of Northampton (and possibly Somerset) and was perhaps given a \u00a320 bribe.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} This interpretation has been questioned by Peck, who asserts that Hoskyns' misunderstanding of the allusion was \"unlikely\" given his educational background, and Hoskyns was a known opponent of Scottish influence. Thus, in her view: \"it seems more reasonable to view Hoskyns not as the innocent tool or victim of the pro-Spanish interests, but as a member of the Commons who agreed with the idea of sending home the Scots\".{{sfn|Peck|1981|p=550}}}}           Hoskins grimly hinted that the lives of these Scottish courtiers were in danger, alluding to the ethnic massacre of the [[Anjou|Angevins]] in the [[Sicilian Vespers]]; this was communicated to the king as a threat to the life of himself and his closest friends, such that he likely feared himself in danger of assassination.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} One MP, Sir Thomas Roe, was more prescient, if somewhat melodramatic, in his judgement that the impending dissolution would be \"the ending, not only of this, but of all Parliaments\".{{sfn|Thrush|2014}} The Commons issued their own ultimatum to James: if he abolished impositions, \"wherewith the whole kingdom doth groan\", they would give him financial support.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\nHowever, James was in no position to give up such a source of income.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} While the anti-Northampton faction pleaded with the king to [[Prorogation in the United Kingdom|prorogue]] rather than dissolve Parliament, the king visited Northampton on his deathbed. Northampton persuaded the desperate king to dissolve Parliament, and shortly after James contacted the Spanish Ambassador, [[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a, 1st Count of Gondomar|the Count of Gondomar]], to be assured of Spain's support.

Lasting only two months, it saw no bills pass and was not even regarded as a Parliament by its contemporaries. However, for this legislative failure it has been known to posterity as the '''Addled Parliament'''.\n\nJames had struggled with debt ever since he came to the English throne. The failure of the [[Blessed Parliament]] of 1604\u20131610 to, in its six-year sitting, rescue the king from his mounting debt or allow James to unite his two kingdoms, had left him bitter with the body. The four-year hiatus between Parliaments saw the royal debt and deficit grow further, despite the best efforts of [[Lord High Treasurer|Treasurer]] [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]. The failure of the last and most lucrative financial expedient of this period, a foreign [[dowry]] from the marriage of his heir-apparent, finally convinced James to recall Parliament in early 1614.\n\nThe Parliament got off to a bad start, with poor choices made for the king's representatives in Parliament. Rumours of conspiracy to manage (the \"undertaking\") or pack the Parliament for the king, though not based in fact, spread quickly. This spreading, and the ultimate failure of Parliament, has been generally attributed to the scheming of the crypto-Catholic [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]], though this has met with some recent skepticism. Parliament opened on 5 April and, despite the king's wishes it would be a \"Parliament of Love\", flung itself immediately into the controversy over the conspiracies, splitting parliament and leading to the exclusion of one alleged packer. However, by late April, Parliament had moved on to a familiar controversy, that of [[impositions]]. The Commons were pitted against the Lords, culminating in a controversy over an unrestrained speech by one prelate.\n\nJames grew impatient with the Parliamentary proceedings. He issued an ultimatum to Parliament, but they treated it irreverently. Insult was added to injury by belligerent, and supposedly threatening, attacks on him from the Commons. On the advice of Northampton, James dissolved Parliament on 7 June, and had 4 MPs sent to the [[Tower of London]]. James fell back on new financial expedients to settle his still-growing debt, to little success. Historiographically, historians are divided between the [[Whig history|Whiggish]] view of the Parliament as anticipating the constitutional disputes of future Parliaments, and the revisionist view of it as a conflict primarily concerned with James's finances.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|James VI and I|Blessed Parliament}}\n[[File:King James I of England and VI of Scotland in Parliament by Renold or Reginold Elstrack (Elstracke).jpg|left|thumb|King James I at the [[Blessed Parliament]] on 5 November 1605.]]\nJames VI and I (1566\u20141625) ascended to the [[List of Scottish monarchs|Scottish throne]] on 24 July 1567, and subsequently to the [[List of English monarchs|English and Irish throne]] on 24 March 1603, becoming [[Union of the Crowns|the first king of to reign over both kingdoms]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} James inherited, with the latter throne, a national debt to the amount of \u00a3300,000, a sum that only increased during his reign. By 1608, it stood at \u00a31 million. During his predecessor [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s reign, the inward revenue of the crown had steadily fallen; taxes from customs and land were consistently undervalued and the parliamentary subsidies steadily shrank.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It did not help that James reigned as \"one of the most extravagant kings\" in English history.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} In peace, Elizabeth's yearly expenditure never rose above \u00a3300,000; almost immediately after James took the throne, it was at \u00a3400,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} James had instituted various extra-parliamentary plans to recuperate this lost income, but these drew controversy from Parliament, and James still wanted for money.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} Moreover, James was keen to not be \"a husband to two wives\" as king, and to unite his crowns as one kingdom of [[Great Britain]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} urging for \"one king, one people, and one law\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}{{efn|In James's original Latinism: \"{{lang|la|Unus Rex}} [...] {{lang|la|Unus Grex}} and {{lang|la|Una Lex}}\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}}} The first parliament of his reign, also known as the [[Blessed Parliament]], was called in 1604; it took seven years, five sessions, to dissolve,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} ending unsatisfactorily for both king and Parliament.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In the first session, many members feared James's unification would lead to the dissolution of the English [[Common Law]] system. Though many prominent politicians publicly praised the idea of unification and MPs accepted a commission to investigate the union early in the Parliament, James's proposed title of the \"king of Great Britain\" was rejected outright.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} Between the first and second sessions, in October 1604, James assumed the title of king of Great Britain by proclamation, controversially circumventing parliament. Unification was not brought up at the second session, to ease outrage,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but by the end of the third session, unification faced such criticism from MPs that it was practically dead.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It was quietly dropped from discussion in the fourth and fifth sessions.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}\n\n[[File:John de Critz Robert Cecil Earl of Salisbury c 1608.png||thumb|[[Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury]] depicted with the white staff of a [[Lord High Treasurer]]. Though a skilled treasurer, Salisbury was unable to significantly reduce the Crown's crippling debt before his death.]]\n\nDuring the Blessed Parliament, Parliament's own aims saw similar disappointment; James rebuffed the proposed institution of Puritan ecclesiastical reforms,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} and failed to address two unpopular royal rights, [[purveyance]] and [[wardship]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{efn|According to Andrew Thrush of [[The History of Parliament]]: \"Purveyance was the right of the Crown to take up provisions for the royal household at below the market rate, while wardship was the right of the Crown to manage the estates of minors whose lands were held of the king.\"{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}}} In the second session, Parliament granted the king a subsidy of between \u00a3400,000, keen to exhibit royal support in the wake of the Gunpowder Plot,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but thanks to the reduction of these subsidies under Elizabeth, this was rather less than the king desired.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} After a 3-year delay between sessions due to plague, the fourth session was called in February 1610, and was dominated by financial discussion. [[Lord High Treasurer]], [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]] proposed the [[Great Contract]]: a financial plan wherein Parliament would grant the Crown \u00a3600,000 immediately (to pay off its debts) and an annual stipend of \u00a3200,000 thereafter; in return, the king was to abolish ten feudal dues, among them, purveyance. After much haggling, in which wardship was added to the abolished dues, the session adjourned on a supportive note. However, when the next session began, support had cooled. Parliament refused to give an annual stipend unless James abolished [[impositions]] as well.{{efn|Impositions were bringing James \u00a370,000 annually, a sum which would only expand with the growth of trade in England.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} By the 1630s, they were bringing the king \u00a3218,000 a year.{{sfn|Russell|1990|p=39}}}} Parliament did give the king an immediate subsidy, but the proposed \u00a3600,000 was reduced to a mere \u00a3100,000. By 6 November 1610, James demanded the other \u00a3500,000 and conditioned that, if impositions were to be abolished, Parliament would have to supply him with another equally lucrative income source. Parliament were outraged, and the Contract was abandoned three days later. Though both Salisbury and James made conciliatory gestures in hope of securing at least some more funds, James grew impatient, and proclaimed the dissolution of the Parliament on 31 December.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} James's first parliament ended on a bitter note; \"your greatest error\", he chastised Salisbury, \"hath been that ye ever expected to draw honey out of gall.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=80}}\n\nAfter this, James was not keen to call another Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} However, without Parliament to raise taxes, the treasury was forced to find new ways to raise money.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In 1611, the City of London loaned the Crown \u00a3100,000; \u00a360,000 was extracted from [[Louis XIII of France|the King of France]] over debts accumulated in the reign of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]; [[Honour#Awards|honours]] were sold to wealthy gentlemen, raising \u00a390,000; a forced loan was levied on nearly 10,000 people.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|pp=148\u2013149}} Yet, after the death of Treasurer Salisbury in 1612, England's finances still remained destitute, with a debt of \u00a3500,000 and annual [[Deficit spending|deficit]] of \u00a3160,000.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|p=149}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=10}} However, James's principal fiscal expedient was to be the marriage of his [[heir-apparent]], [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry, Prince of Wales]], for which he expected a sizeable [[dowry]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} not to mention a foreign ally.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=84}} James went into talks with several Catholic countries but, in late 1612, aged 18, Henry contracted [[typhoid]] and abruptly died;{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=85}} [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]], newly heir-apparent at age 12, took his place in the negotiations. Negotiations were going most promisingly in France, where a marriage of Prince Charles to the 6-year-old Princess [[Christine of France]] promised a healthy sum of \u00a3240,000, almost halving James's debt.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} However, by early 1614, France's internal religious strife had intensified to such a point that civil war seemed imminent, so negotiations stalled on the French side; James grew impatient.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James's financial insecurity had only worsened in this time, the debt now at \u00a3680,000 and the deficit, \u00a3200,000.{{sfn|Roberts|1985|p=7}} Conspicuous consumption had raised yearly expenditure to an unsustainable \u00a3522,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|pp=98-99}} A group of advisors, led by the [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Earls of Suffolk]] and [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]], encouraged the king to call a Parliament to raise funds, convincing James \"that\"\u2014as he later put it\u2014\"my subjects did not hate me, which I know I had not deserved.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Northampton stringently opposed the meeting,{{sfn|Cramsie|2002|p=135}} but, reluctantly, James summoned another parliament in 1614.

Two of the king's closest advisors were unavailable, the Earls of Salisbury was dead and Northampton was ill.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Even Suffolk and Pembroke were clueless of any way to prevent Parliament from bringing up thorny issues such as impositions again.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} However, two Councillors were to provide advice to the king over his new parliament, which would prove significant.{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] [[Sir Francis Bacon]], who had been among the most vocal in favour of calling Parliament, blamed Salisbury entirely for the failure of the previous Parliament, privately holding the treasurer had undermine his early career. He asserted that Salisbury's deal-making had been the king's downfall, and that the king should approach Parliament as a king, rather than a merchant, and request subsidies on the basis of the Commons' good will.{{sfn|Willson|1967|pp=344-345}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|pp=251-252}} Bacon added to this that the king should employ patronage to win over the men of Parliament to his side.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=489}} [[Sir Henry Neville (died 1615)|Sir Henry Neville]] offered advice to the king on how to warm relations with Parliament, which he accepted amiably.{{sfn|Thrush|2010c}} But Neville's more portentous offer was that of an \"undertaking\", whereby Neville and a group of \"patriots\" would arrange to manage the Parliament in James's favour, in return for the office of Secretary of State.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} James rejected the undertaking derisively, and no such conspiracy was ever arranged,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} but rumours of its actual occurrence spread quickly in the lead up to Parliament.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=491}}\n\nMPs later accused James of trying to [[wikt:pack#Verb|pack]] the Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=52}} Indeed, Bacon had plainly advised the king on the \"placing of persons well-affected and discreet\" in Parliament,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=221-222}} and James was unapologetic in packing the Irish Parliament the previous year.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93}}{{efn|James attempted to pack the Irish Parliament of 1613 with Protestants by adding a 84 new seats to the former 148 that election: 38 represented tiny or as-yet nonexistent settlements in the Protestant [[Ulster plantation]]. The election came out with a Protestant majority of 32. James insisted he was within his royal right in doing this and mocked the Parliament's grievances.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93, 148}}}} A large number of Crown officials found themselves in this Parliament,{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} four Privy Councillors found themselves in the Commons, alongside plenty of Crown lawyers.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=222-223}} Though there is no evidence that the Crown sought to pack Parliament with easily controlled and pacified MPs, James certainly promoted the election of those sympathetic to the crown.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} However, there is more evidence of an apathy towards this Parliament from the [[Privy Council]]: few of the expected preparations were made.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} After some Byzantine wrangling in which another better-qualified candidate was dropped, [[Ranulph Crewe]], MP for the [[rotten borough|government-controlled borough]] of [[Saltash (UK Parliament constituency)|Saltash]], was chosen at the last minute to be the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]].{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=41-42}} This was a surprising choice: Crewe's previous experience in Parliament was limited to a short stint as an MP in 1597-98 and an appearance on two minor legal counsels, his legal career was no more impressive.{{sfn|Hunneyball|2010}} Crewe's inexperience precipitated the disorder that Parliament would quickly descend into.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=169}} James's most senior representative in the House of Commons, [[Ralph Winwood]], [[Secretary of State (England)|Secretary of State]], was announced similarly late. Though an spirited official and zealous Puritan, Winwood had no parliamentary experience at all and was a terse, unlikable figure.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=345}} The new House of Commons as a whole was not especially inexperienced,{{efn|61% (281 out of 464) of the members had never sat in Parliament before, a little above the Elizabethan average of 50%, but perfectly reasonable given the decade interval between elections.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=55}}}} but it was the inexperience of his most important officials and advisors that was to damage the king.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=55}}\n\n===Opening: Rumours and conspiracy===\n[[File:Henry Neville 1599.jpg|right|thumb|The first six weeks of Parliament were marked by the suspicion of an \"undertaking\", headed by Sir [[Henry Neville (died 1615)|Henry Neville]].]]\nParliament opened on 5 April 1614.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James opened the Parliament with the wish that it would come to be known as the \"Parliament of Love\", and that king and Parliament would go on in harmony and understanding.{{sfn|Mondi|2007|p=153}} His opening speech was divided into three sections: the first ({{lang|la|bona animi}}), decrying the growth of Catholicism and imploring the harsher enforcement of existing laws;{{efn|According to Thomas L. Moir, this aspect of James's speech \"displayed one of those flashes of visions which occasionally revealed his intellectual capacity.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=81}} Rather than demand the institution of new anti-Catholic legislature, James contended that persecution only aided the Catholic cause, and that, as Protestantism was correct, it could reject Catholicism for its own fallacies.

For a brief period, this investigation dominated the Commons: Parry was suspended from the House and, passingly, from his Chancellorship. For many in parliament, this seemed evidence enough that the king's officials had attempted to pack Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}}{{sfn|Seddon|2008}} Simultaneously, a [[Parliamentary committees of the United Kingdom|committee]] to inquire into the alleged undertaking was launched, though this proved less fruitful. The committee's chairman returned on 2 May; he spoke confusingly, but concluded against the existence of any undertaking. However, Parliamentary provocateur [[John Hoskins (poet)|John Hoskins]] demanded further investigation, which the House accepted.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} On 14 May, the inquiry ended; after six weeks of Parliament, rumours of an undertaking had finally been dismissed.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} By the end, resentment against the undertakers had dissipated, and Neville was never suspended for his part, but rather met with commendation from Parliament in his efforts to remedy its grievances.

After five days of debate, the Lords returned with their formal refusal of such a conference, meeting with the astonishment of many.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} The Lords had voted 39 to 30 against it, carried by the near unanimity of the Bishops against this conference.{{efn|Out of the 17 [[prelates]] who voted, all but one opposed the conference, namely the old-fashioned [[Archbishop of York]], [[Tobias Matthew]].{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}}}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}} [[Lord Spiritual]] [[Richard Neile]], who was one of the most vocal opponents of the conference,{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=116-117}} added insult to injury with a sharp speech condemning the petitioners.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}} The remarks made in this speech, known as the \"{{lang|la|Noli me tangere}} speech\", have been described by one historian as \"the most dangerous words used in the reign [of James I] by any politician.\"{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=228}} The Commons refused to conduct any more business until Neile had been punished for this affront.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} Though the Commons received a tearful apology and retraction from the Bishop on 30 May, they were unsatisfied, and doubled down on their demands of disciplinary action.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=130-131}} By the end of May, as Moir put it, \"the temper of the Commons had reached a fever pitch\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=132}} and leadership had broke down in this intractable atmosphere.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=132-133}} No punishment for Neile, however, ever materialised, and the king was growing impatient with Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\n===Finale: James grows impatient===\n[[File:Henry Howard Earl of Northampton circle of Gheeraerts.JPG|right|thumb|[[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton]]'s wishes were finally fulfilled on his deathbed, as James dissolved Parliament and looked for Spanish support.]]\n\nParliament was adjourned on 1 June for [[Ascension Day]], reconvening again on 3 June.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} When the Commons met on this day, they received an ultimatum from the king: unless Parliament agreed to grant him a financial supply soon, he would dissolve Parliament on 9 June.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=136}} James expected this to shock the Commons into pursuing his aims, but instead it only entrenched the opposition further into its obstinancy. Many felt this demand was a bluff; the king was stil deeply in debt, and Parliamentary subsidies still seemed his only way out. Instead of effecting any subsidies, the Commons attacked the king mercilessly. His Court, especially the Scots, were accused of extravagance, suggesting the king would have no need for impositions or subsidies if not for these subjects.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} As one member memorably pronounced, James's courtiers were \"spaniels to the king and wolves to the people\".{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=229}} Encouraged by Northampton,{{efn|According to Moir, Hoskins here \"seems to have been simply the tool of the pro-Spanish [i.e. Northampton's] interests.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} The provocative historical reference was submitted by two of Northampton's lackeys: [[Lionel Sharpe]], [[Sir Charles Cornwallis (diplomat)|Sir Charles Cornwallis]]. Gardiner alleges he was not the most historically learned member, and likely misunderstood the insinuation of the reference. Either way, Hoskins was promised the protection of Northampton (and possibly Somerset) and was perhaps given a \u00a320 bribe.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} This interpretation has been questioned by Peck, who asserts that Hoskyns' misunderstanding of the allusion was \"unlikely\" given his educational background, and Hoskyns was a known opponent of Scottish influence. Thus, in her view: \"it seems more reasonable to view Hoskyns not as the innocent tool or victim of the pro-Spanish interests, but as a member of the Commons who agreed with the idea of sending home the Scots\".{{sfn|Peck|1981|p=550}}}}           Hoskins grimly hinted that the lives of these Scottish courtiers were in danger, alluding to the ethnic massacre of the [[Anjou|Angevins]] in the [[Sicilian Vespers]]; this was communicated to the king as a threat to the life of himself and his closest friends, such that he likely feared himself in danger of assassination.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} One MP, Sir Thomas Roe, was more prescient, if somewhat melodramatic, in his judgement that the impending dissolution would be \"the ending, not only of this, but of all Parliaments\".{{sfn|Thrush|2014}} The Commons issued their own ultimatum to James: if he abolished impositions, \"wherewith the whole kingdom doth groan\", they would give him financial support.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\nHowever, James was in no position to give up such a source of income.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} While the anti-Northampton faction pleaded with the king to [[Prorogation in the United Kingdom|prorogue]] rather than dissolve Parliament, the king visited Northampton on his deathbed. Northampton persuaded the desperate king to dissolve Parliament, and shortly after James contacted the Spanish Ambassador, [[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a, 1st Count of Gondomar|the Count of Gondomar]], to be assured of Spain's support. James dissolved Parliament on 7 June 1614.

From that single failure, all the constitutional troubles of the reign stemmed.{{sfn|Clucas|Davies|2003|p=2}}}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of MPs elected to the English parliament in 1614]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite book |last1=Clucas |first1=Stephen |last2=Davies |first2=Rosalind |date=2003 |chapter=Introduction |editor1-last=Clucas |editor1-first=Stephen |editor2-last=Davies |editor2-first=Rosalind |title=The Crisis of 1614 and The Addled Parliament: Literary and Historical Perspectives |edition=1st |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |location=Aldershot |isbn=978-0-7546-0681-9 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Crisis_of_1614_and_the_Addled_Parlia.html?id=wVdnAAAAMAAJ |ref=harv }}\n: {{cite book |last=Cramsie |first=John |date=2002 |title=Kingship and Crown Finance under James VI and I, 1603\u20131625 |location=Suffolk |publisher=The Boydell Press |series=[[Royal Historical Society Studies in History]] (New Series) |isbn=978-0-86193-259-7 |ref=harv }}\n: {{cite book |last=Croft |first=Pauline |author-link=Pauline Croft |date=2003 |title=King James |location=Hampshire |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |url=https://archive.org/details/kingjames00crof |url-access=registration |oclc=938114859 |ref=harv }}\n: {{cite book |last=Dietz |first=Frederick C. |date=1964 |title=English Public Finance, 1558\u20131641 |series=English Public Finance, 1485\u20131641 |volume=2 |edition=2nd |publisher=Barnes & Noble, Inc. |location=New York |url=https://archive.org/details/englishpublicfin0002diet |url-access=registration |oclc=22976184 |ref=harv }}\n: {{cite journal |last1=Duncan |first1=Owen |last2=Roberts |first2=Clayton |date=July 1978 |title= The Parliamentary Undertaking of 1614  |journal=[[The English Historical Review]] |volume=93 |issue=238 |pp=481\u2013498  |doi=10.1093/ehr/xciii.ccclxviii.481 |jstor=565464 |ref=harv }} \n: {{cite book |last=Gardiner |first=Samuel R. |date=1883 |title=History of England from the Accession of James I to the Outbreak of the Civil War, 1603\u20131642.
