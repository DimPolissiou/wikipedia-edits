Our ancestors survived on a diet high in fish, nuts, fruits, vegetables, wild game meat and bones. They also received a large amount of exercise from walking, bending, lifting, carrying, swimming, climbing, and other activities that were necessary to their daily routines.<ref>{{YouTube|sBVlXOliI8M|Dr. James O'Keefe on How to Live a Heart Healthy Lifestyle}}</ref> O\u2019Keefe recommends beverages including water, sparkling water, green tea and coffee; also, red wine can be a healthy choice if used in moderation.<ref>{{YouTube|KOc-susXfVY|Dr. James O'Keefe on The Best Diet for Preventing Heart Disease}}</ref>\n\n== Evolutionary basis of homosexuality ==\nO\u2019Keefe gave a TEDx Talk in October 2016, on the natural origin of homosexuality. In this talk, and subsequent scientific paper, he proposes a theory about the evolutionary basis of homosexuality mediated by epigenetics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.glreview.org/article/evolutionary-origins-of-homosexuality/|title=Evolutionary Origins of Homosexuality|last=O\u2019Keefe JH, O\u2019Keefe EL, Hodes J|first=|date=2018|website=The Gay & Lesbian Review|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-22}}</ref>  This theory posits that homosexuality is a naturally intended, normal variant that evolved to improve the interconnectedness and resilience of the family. The suite of psychological traits that tend to co-occur with same-sex orientation include increased IQ, and higher emotional intelligence, with less physical aggression. Through a complex interplay of epigenetics and genetics, homosexuality occurs more often in larger families, especially in a baby boy with multiple older brothers, or at times of increased stress during the pregnancy. In these settings, homosexuality is prescribed by nature largely via epigenetic changes in the developing fetus in response to the mother's environment. This can help to reduce overpopulation pressures at the family level; the gay individual also tends to improve the emotional bonding of their family and friends, thereby improving the strength survivability of the group.\n\n== Research ==\nO'Keefe's research and publications have focused mostly on exercise, diet and evolution.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2008.08.050 |pmid=19055985 |title=Vitamin D Deficiency |journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology |volume=52 |issue=24 |pages=1949\u201356 |year=2008 |last1=Lee |first1=John H |last2=O'Keefe |first2=James H |last3=Bell |first3=David |last4=Hensrud |first4=Donald D |last5=Holick |first5=Michael F }}</ref> Daily exercise is one of the key components of lifestyle for promoting health and longevity, and will reduce risks for heart disease, Alzheimer's, hypertension, osteoporosis, depression and diabetes dramatically.

O'Keefe, MD]]\n'''James O'Keefe Jr.''' (born June 8, 1956) is an American author and [[cardiologist]] who has conducted studies in the field of cardiovascular medicine, diet and exercise. O'Keefe is a leading proponent of exercise but argues that moderate rather than extreme efforts, in a social setting-like are best for conferring longevity. He has also proposed a hypothesis regarding the evolutionary basis of homosexuality. He is currently a professor of medicine at the [[University of Missouri\u2013Kansas City]], Director of Preventive Cardiology at the Mid America Heart Institute of Saint Luke's hospital and Chief Medical Officer of the health supplement company Cardiotabs.\n\n==Career==\nJames Henry O'Keefe Jr. was born to James Henry O'Keefe Sr. and Leatrice O\u2019Keefe in [[Grand Forks, North Dakota]], on June 8, 1956. He graduated from the [[University of North Dakota]] where he received an undergraduate BS ''summa cum laude'' and [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in Natural Science. In 1982, he received his MD ''summa cum laude'' with his MD from [[Baylor College of Medicine]].

Our ancestors survived on a diet high in fish, nuts, fruits, vegetables, wild game meat and bones. They also received a large amount of exercise from walking, bending, lifting, carrying, swimming, climbing, and other activities that were necessary to their daily routines.<ref>{{YouTube|sBVlXOliI8M|Dr. James O'Keefe on How to Live a Heart Healthy Lifestyle}}</ref> O\u2019Keefe recommends beverages including water, sparkling water, green tea and coffee; also, red wine can be a healthy choice if used in moderation.<ref>{{YouTube|KOc-susXfVY|Dr. James O'Keefe on The Best Diet for Preventing Heart Disease}}</ref>\n\n== Evolutionary basis of homosexuality ==\nO\u2019Keefe gave a TEDx Talk in October 2016, on the natural origin of homosexuality. In this talk, and subsequent scientific paper, he proposes a theory about the evolutionary basis of homosexuality mediated by epigenetics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.glreview.org/article/evolutionary-origins-of-homosexuality/|title=Evolutionary Origins of Homosexuality|last=O\u2019Keefe JH, O\u2019Keefe EL, Hodes J|first=|date=2018|website=The Gay & Lesbian Review|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-22}}</ref>  This theory posits that homosexuality is a naturally intended, normal variant that evolved to improve the interconnectedness and resilience of the family. The suite of psychological traits that tend to co-occur with same-sex orientation include increased IQ, and higher emotional intelligence, with less physical aggression. Through a complex interplay of epigenetics and genetics, homosexuality occurs more often in larger families, especially in a baby boy with multiple older brothers, or at times of increased stress during the pregnancy. In these settings, homosexuality is prescribed by nature largely via epigenetic changes in the developing fetus in response to the mother's environment. This can help to reduce overpopulation pressures at the family level; the gay individual also tends to improve the emotional bonding of their family and friends, thereby improving the strength survivability of the group.\n\n== Research ==\nO'Keefe's research and publications have focused mostly on exercise, diet and evolution.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2008.08.050 |pmid=19055985 |title=Vitamin D Deficiency |journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology |volume=52 |issue=24 |pages=1949\u201356 |year=2008 |last1=Lee |first1=John H |last2=O'Keefe |first2=James H |last3=Bell |first3=David |last4=Hensrud |first4=Donald D |last5=Holick |first5=Michael F }}</ref> Daily exercise is one of the key components of lifestyle for promoting health and longevity, and will reduce risks for heart disease, Alzheimer's, hypertension, osteoporosis, depression and diabetes dramatically.

Alexander led Murray State for four seasons, posting a 45-54 record, including a 15-10 mark in 1955-56. But after his first team was Ohio Valley Conference regular-season and tournament runners-up, his teams never finished higher than third in the conference and he was replaced by DePauw University head coach Cal Luther on March 5, 1958. Alexander agreed to stay on as an assistant coach under Luther.\n\n===Luther era (1959\u20131974)===\n\nIn 1958, Murray State hired [[Cal Luther]], who had served the previous four seasons as head coach at [[DePauw Tigers|DePauw]]. In 16 seasons under Luther, Murray State won three OVC regular-season championships and made the NCAA Tournament in [[1964 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1964]] and [[1969 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1969]]. His 1970-71 team reached No. 17 in the [[Associated Press Poll|Associated Press poll]], entering the rankings after a thrilling 73-71 victory over [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|Western Kentucky]] in Murray. WKU would go on to reach the [[1971 NCAA Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] Final Four that season. A two-time OVC Coach of the Year, Luther led the Racers to a 241-134 record.\n\nLuther's most notable players were future professional players [[Dick Cunningham]], [[Claude Virden]] and [[Stew Johnson|Stewart Johnson]], as well as Racer greats Herb McPherson, Jim Jennings and Les Taylor.\n\nCal Luther was a firebrand of a coach. The standing joke at the university was the over and under of Cal throwing off his jacket during a game due to a call by a ref, or from frustration with a player. The latter part of his tenure was marred by an OVC issue with testing and which tests the schools in the OVC used to qualify athletes. During the 1973-74 season several players were disqualified for using an illegal testing equivalency. This happened across the OVC, and Murray was not the only school to lose student athletes. Most of the disqualified athletes were allowed to transfer by the NCAA to other schools, but OVC schools lost the services of those athletes who had not actually taken the SAT, but had taken the ACT.\n\n===Overton era (1975\u20131978)===\n\nAfter three seasons as an assistant under Cal Luther, [[Fred Overton]] was elevated to head coach in 1975. After a 9-17 first season, the Racers started the 1976-77 season with a 17-6 record before dropping their last four games for a 17-10 final ledger, finishing second in the OVC. But after the Racers posted an 8-17 in 1977-78, Overton was fired.<ref>[http://racerhistory.com Racerhistory.com]</ref>\n\n===Greene era (1978\u20131985)===\n[[Ron Greene]] returned to his alma mater fresh off earning the AP Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year award at Mississippi State in 1978.\n\nAfter managing only four wins in his first season as coach at Murray, Greene led the Racers to 23 wins the following year and an appearance in the [[National Invitation Tournament]]. The Racers knocked off Jacksonville and Alabama before losing to Illinois 65-63 in the quarterfinals, all on the road. Greene's Racers would win three Ohio Valley Conference regular-season titles and reach the NIT twice more under his guidance.\n\nA highlight of the 1981\u201382 season came when Murray State traveled to South Bend, Indiana, to play against [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]].  Murray State defeated a [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]] team coached by [[Digger Phelps]] 56-54.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/08/sports/murray-state-56-notre-dame-54.html | work=The New York Times | title=Murray State 56 Notre Dame 54 | date=8 December 1981}}</ref>\n\nHis overall record at Murray State was 119-78.

Martin did not make the team but impressed many with his performance.\n\nThe best-known player in the Newton era is [[Popeye Jones]].  While at Murray State, Jones scored 2,057 points which still ranks fourth all time for the Racers. He is also Murray State's all-time leader in rebounds with 1,374, and led the nation in that category in the 1990\u201391 season. Jones is the only player in MSU history to record more than 2,000 points and 1,000 rebounds.  Jones helped lead the Racers to OVC championships in 1991 and 1992. He went on to have a successful career in the NBA after being drafted in the second round by the [[Houston Rockets]] in the 1992 NBA Draft.\n\n===Edgar era (1992\u20131995)===\n\n[[Scott Edgar (basketball)|Scott Edgar]] was hired as head basketball coach after serving six seasons as an assistant coach under [[Nolan Richardson]] at [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|Arkansas]]. Bringing a version of Richardson's uptempo \"40 Minutes of Hell\" philosophy to Murray, Edgar led the Racers to two NCAA tournament appearances ([[1992 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1992]], [[1995 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1995]]) and one NIT appearance ([[1994 National Invitation Tournament|1994]]) in four seasons. His teams won three OVC regular-season championships (1992, 1994 and 1995), posting a 48-14 record in conference games during his tenure.\n\nEdgar recruited Racer greats [[Marcus Brown]] and Vincent Rainey to Murray State, with Brown averaging 22.4 points and Rainey 18.8 points in Edgar's final season at Murray.\n\nEdgar left Murray State after the 1994-95 season to become head coach at [[Duquesne Dukes men's basketball|Duquesne]].\n\n===Gottfried era (1995\u20131998)===\n[[Mark Gottfried]] was hired as head basketball coach after serving seven seasons as an assistant coach under [[Jim Harrick]] at [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]]. Gottfried was hired shortly after he finished the 1995 season with the Bruins, in which he helped lead the Bruins to an [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]]. Mark Gottfried was also the nephew of ESPN analyst and former Murray State football coach [[Mike Gottfried]].\n\nIn Gottfried's first season, the Racers returned four starters, including [[Marcus Brown]], from the Racer team that nearly upset North Carolina in the 1995 NCAA Tournament, and the team was picked to finished first in the OVC. The Racers won the Ohio Valley Conference regular season championship in 1996 for the third straight season; however, the Racers were defeated in the OVC tournament. In the final game of the tournament, Murray State's Vincent Rainey was charged with a foul with two-tenths of a second left on the clock in a tie game against the rival [[Austin Peay Governors]]. APSU's Reggie Crenshaw made two free throws and the Racers lost the game 70-68. As a result of the loss, the Racers did not reach the 1996 NCAA Tournament. The Racers lost to the [[Missouri Tigers]] in the opening round of the 1996 National Invitational Tournament, and finished the season 19-10. [[Marcus Brown]] finished his college playing career at the close of the 1996 season with 2,236 career points, which is third best in Murray State history.\n\nWith a November 23, 1996, victory over the [[Belmont Bruins men's basketball|Belmont Bruins]], the Racers began a 47-game home winning streak that would last into the 1999\u20132000 season. The Racers won the 1997 OVC Tournament with an overtime win over Austin Peay and earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nESPN's College Basketball Encyclopedia names the Racers 1997\u201398 season as having the best team in school history. OVC player of the year De'Teri Mayes led the 1997\u201398 team to 23 victories by double digit margins. Isaac Spencer was a freshman on the team. Spencer would go on to score 2,248 points over four seasons, which places him second place all time for the Racers. The Racers won both the OVC regular season and OVC tournament again in 1998; however, Murray State fell to number eight seed Rhode Island in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. The Racers finished the season a number 25 ranking in the final AP Poll. Mark Gottfried won three Ohio Valley Conference Championships in each of his three seasons, the only OVC coach to accomplish such a mark.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Mark Gottfried''|work=Rolltide.com|url=http://www.rolltide.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=8000&ATCLID=239593|date=2002-05-02|accessdate=2007-03-05}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>''ESPN College Basketball Encyclopedia: The Complete History of the Men's Game''. 2009. p 31.</ref>\n\nGottfried was hired by [[Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball|Alabama]] to be head basketball coach in March 1998. He had been a starting player for the Crimson Tide for three seasons between 1985 and 1987.\n\n===Anderson era (1998\u20132003)===\n[[Tevester Anderson]] was promoted to head coach of the Racers in March, 1998 after [[Mark Gottfried]] left Murray State to take the head coach position at the [[University of Alabama]]. Anderson, the first African American to serve as head coach of the Murray State men's basketball team, had previously served as an assistant coach under Gottfried during the previous three seasons. At age 61, Anderson was also the oldest rookie head coach in NCAA Division I basketball. In his first year as coach of the Racers, Anderson led the team to a 27-6 record, an Ohio Valley Conference championship, and an NCAA Tournament appearance. Anderson was named the OVC's Co-Coach of the Year and was named NABC District 7 Coach of the Year following the 1998\u201399 season.<ref>\"Anderson Hired at Murray State\". ''Kentucky New Era''. March 28, 1998. p 3B.</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1015130/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Rookie Of The Year | date=22 February 1999}}</ref>\n\nIn Anderson's second year as head coach, the Racers finished the 1999\u20132000 season with a 23-9 record. The record was good enough to capture a share of the OVC regular season championship, but the Racer's failed to win the OVC Tournament and earn a spot in the NCAA Tournament. Murray State home court winning streak, the longest in the nation, also came to an end in 2000 with a January 15 loss to [[Southeast Missouri State University]].\n\nOver the next three years under Anderson, the success of the Racer basketball program steadily declined, culminating in a low point during the 2002\u201303 season. The Racers finished the 2002\u201303 season with a 17-12 record, which was fourth-place in the OVC standings. The fourth-place finish was the worst finish in the OVC standings since the 1986\u201387 season. Amid rumors that Anderson would relinquish his coaching duties at Murray State under pressure from university officials, he resigned from the head coach position in March 2003.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://murrayledger.com/anderson-retires-as-racers-head-coach/article_07d9a74c-dd7b-575b-95a4-23568d84d141.html |title=Anderson retires as Racers' head coach - Murray Ledger & Times: Home |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2003-03-24 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref> Anderson was named as the new head coach at [[Jackson State University]] in April 2003.<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://murrayledger.com/anderson-to-take-over-at-jackson-state/article_a355ded1-0ab3-5b7c-982b-5d678d5c2169.html |title=Anderson to take over at Jackson State - Murray Ledger & Times: Home |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2003-04-09 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref>\n\n===Cronin era (2003\u20132006)===\nPreviously an assistant at [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati]] (1997\u20132001) under [[Bob Huggins]] and at [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]] (2001\u201303) under [[Rick Pitino]], Mick Cronin was introduced as the new head coach of the Racers on April 5, 2003. When he accepted the position, Cronin became the fourth youngest head coach in NCAA Division-I basketball. In Cronin's first season as head coach, the Racers won the OVC tournament and advanced to the first round of the NCAA Tournament where the Racers fell to No. 5 seeded Illinois. The success of the 2003\u201304 season was also tainted by arrests and suspensions. Just before the start of the 2004 NCAA Tournament, juniors Adam Chiles and Kelvin Brown were arrested on drug charges. Chiles was charged with hindering prosecution and possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, and Brown was charged with theft from an alleged gas drive-off, possession of marijuana, and his second offense of possession of drug paraphernalia. Both were arrested following a 911 hangup call from their apartment in which Chiles was found outside and Brown was found hiding in a closet. Chiles was cleared to play in the tournament, but Brown was suspended indefinitely and later dismissed from the team in April.<ref>\"Drugs, suspension taint Racers' glorious season\". The Murray State News. March 26, 2004. p 1</ref>\n\nProblems continued for the Racers in the 2004\u201305 season. The team's only returning starter, Adam Chiles, was dismissed from the team in November following his second arrest of 2004. Chiles was stopped by Kentucky State Police while driving on [[Western Kentucky Parkway]] near [[Leitchfield, Kentucky]]. Chiles was charged with driving under the influence, possession of marijuana, possession of an open alcoholic beverage container, and speeding. Chiles had averaged 10.1 points and 3.9 assists for the Racers in the previous season. The Racers went on to finish the 2004\u201305 season with a record of 20-10 and a first round loss in the OVC tournament.<ref>\"Murray State dismisses player after arrest\". Portsmouth Daily Times.

This was the first time that any Ohio Valley Conference team had advanced to the 2nd round of the NCAA Tournament since [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders|Middle Tennessee]] advanced in 1989. The Racers followed up a regular season conference championship for the second year in a row in 2011. The Racers were eliminated from the OVC tournament in 2011; however, they earned a number six seed in the [[National Invitational Tournament]] where the Racers suffered a first round loss to [[Missouri State University]].

Alexander led Murray State for four seasons, posting a 45-54 record, including a 15-10 mark in 1955-56. But after his first team was Ohio Valley Conference regular-season and tournament runners-up, his teams never finished higher than third in the conference and he was replaced by DePauw University head coach Cal Luther on March 5, 1958. Alexander agreed to stay on as an assistant coach under Luther.\n\n===Luther era (1959\u20131974)===\n\nIn 1958, Murray State hired [[Cal Luther]], who had served the previous four seasons as head coach at [[DePauw Tigers|DePauw]]. In 16 seasons under Luther, Murray State won three OVC regular-season championships and made the NCAA Tournament in [[1964 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1964]] and [[1969 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1969]]. His 1970-71 team reached No. 17 in the [[Associated Press Poll|Associated Press poll]], entering the rankings after a thrilling 73-71 victory over [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|Western Kentucky]] in Murray. WKU would go on to reach the [[1971 NCAA Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] Final Four that season. A two-time OVC Coach of the Year, Luther led the Racers to a 241-134 record.\n\nLuther's most notable players were future professional players [[Dick Cunningham]], [[Claude Virden]] and [[Stew Johnson|Stewart Johnson]], as well as Racer greats Herb McPherson, Jim Jennings and Les Taylor.\n\nCal Luther was a firebrand of a coach. The standing joke at the university was the over and under of Cal throwing off his jacket during a game due to a call by a ref, or from frustration with a player. The latter part of his tenure was marred by an OVC issue with testing and which tests the schools in the OVC used to qualify athletes. During the 1973-74 season several players were disqualified for using an illegal testing equivalency. This happened across the OVC, and Murray was not the only school to lose student athletes. Most of the disqualified athletes were allowed to transfer by the NCAA to other schools, but OVC schools lost the services of those athletes who had not actually taken the SAT, but had taken the ACT.\n\n===Overton era (1975\u20131978)===\n\nAfter three seasons as an assistant under Cal Luther, [[Fred Overton]] was elevated to head coach in 1975. After a 9-17 first season, the Racers started the 1976-77 season with a 17-6 record before dropping their last four games for a 17-10 final ledger, finishing second in the OVC. But after the Racers posted an 8-17 in 1977-78, Overton was fired.<ref>[http://racerhistory.com Racerhistory.com]</ref>\n\n===Greene era (1978\u20131985)===\n[[Ron Greene]] returned to his alma mater fresh off earning the AP Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year award at Mississippi State in 1978.\n\nAfter managing only four wins in his first season as coach at Murray, Greene led the Racers to 23 wins the following year and an appearance in the [[National Invitation Tournament]]. The Racers knocked off Jacksonville and Alabama before losing to Illinois 65-63 in the quarterfinals, all on the road. Greene's Racers would win three Ohio Valley Conference regular-season titles and reach the NIT twice more under his guidance.\n\nA highlight of the 1981\u201382 season came when Murray State traveled to South Bend, Indiana, to play against [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]].  Murray State defeated a [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]] team coached by [[Digger Phelps]] 56-54.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/08/sports/murray-state-56-notre-dame-54.html | work=The New York Times | title=Murray State 56 Notre Dame 54 | date=8 December 1981}}</ref>\n\nHis overall record at Murray State was 119-78.

He is also Murray State's all-time leader in rebounds with 1,374, and led the nation in that category in the 1990\u201391 season. Jones is the only player in MSU history to record more than 2,000 points and 1,000 rebounds.  Jones helped lead the Racers to OVC championships in 1991 and 1992. He went on to have a successful career in the NBA after being drafted in the second round by the [[Houston Rockets]] in the 1992 NBA Draft.\n\n===Edgar era (1992\u20131995)===\n\n[[Scott Edgar (basketball)|Scott Edgar]] was hired as head basketball coach after serving six seasons as an assistant coach under [[Nolan Richardson]] at [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|Arkansas]]. Bringing a version of Richardson's uptempo \"40 Minutes of Hell\" philosophy to Murray, Edgar led the Racers to two NCAA tournament appearances ([[1992 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1992]], [[1995 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1995]]) and one NIT appearance ([[1994 National Invitation Tournament|1994]]) in four seasons. His teams won three OVC regular-season championships (1992, 1994 and 1995), posting a 48-14 record in conference games during his tenure.\n\nEdgar recruited Racer greats [[Marcus Brown]] and Vincent Rainey to Murray State, with Brown averaging 22.4 points and Rainey 18.8 points in Edgar's final season at Murray.\n\nEdgar left Murray State after the 1994-95 season to become head coach at [[Duquesne Dukes men's basketball|Duquesne]].\n\n===Gottfried era (1995\u20131998)===\n[[Mark Gottfried]] was hired as head basketball coach after serving seven seasons as an assistant coach under [[Jim Harrick]] at [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]]. Gottfried was hired shortly after he finished the 1995 season with the Bruins, in which he helped lead the Bruins to an [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]]. Mark Gottfried was also the nephew of ESPN analyst and former Murray State football coach [[Mike Gottfried]].\n\nIn Gottfried's first season, the Racers returned four starters, including [[Marcus Brown]], from the Racer team that nearly upset North Carolina in the 1995 NCAA Tournament, and the team was picked to finished first in the OVC. The Racers won the Ohio Valley Conference regular season championship in 1996 for the third straight season; however, the Racers were defeated in the OVC tournament. In the final game of the tournament, Murray State's Vincent Rainey was charged with a foul with two-tenths of a second left on the clock in a tie game against the rival [[Austin Peay Governors]]. APSU's Reggie Crenshaw made two free throws and the Racers lost the game 70-68. As a result of the loss, the Racers did not reach the 1996 NCAA Tournament. The Racers lost to the [[Missouri Tigers]] in the opening round of the 1996 National Invitational Tournament, and finished the season 19-10. [[Marcus Brown]] finished his college playing career at the close of the 1996 season with 2,236 career points, which is third best in Murray State history.\n\nWith a November 23, 1996, victory over the [[Belmont Bruins men's basketball|Belmont Bruins]], the Racers began a 47-game home winning streak that would last into the 1999\u20132000 season. The Racers won the 1997 OVC Tournament with an overtime win over Austin Peay and earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nESPN's College Basketball Encyclopedia names the Racers 1997\u201398 season as having the best team in school history. OVC player of the year De'Teri Mayes led the 1997\u201398 team to 23 victories by double digit margins. Isaac Spencer was a freshman on the team. Spencer would go on to score 2,248 points over four seasons, which places him second place all time for the Racers. The Racers won both the OVC regular season and OVC tournament again in 1998; however, Murray State fell to number eight seed Rhode Island in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. The Racers finished the season a number 25 ranking in the final AP Poll. Mark Gottfried won three Ohio Valley Conference Championships in each of his three seasons, the only OVC coach to accomplish such a mark.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Mark Gottfried''|work=Rolltide.com|url=http://www.rolltide.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=8000&ATCLID=239593|date=2002-05-02|accessdate=2007-03-05}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>''ESPN College Basketball Encyclopedia: The Complete History of the Men's Game''. 2009. p 31.</ref>\n\nGottfried was hired by [[Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball|Alabama]] to be head basketball coach in March 1998. He had been a starting player for the Crimson Tide for three seasons between 1985 and 1987.\n\n===Anderson era (1998\u20132003)===\n[[Tevester Anderson]] was promoted to head coach of the Racers in March, 1998 after [[Mark Gottfried]] left Murray State to take the head coach position at the [[University of Alabama]]. Anderson, the first African American to serve as head coach of the Murray State men's basketball team, had previously served as an assistant coach under Gottfried during the previous three seasons. At age 61, Anderson was also the oldest rookie head coach in NCAA Division I basketball. In his first year as coach of the Racers, Anderson led the team to a 27-6 record, an Ohio Valley Conference championship, and an NCAA Tournament appearance. Anderson was named the OVC's Co-Coach of the Year and was named NABC District 7 Coach of the Year following the 1998\u201399 season.<ref>\"Anderson Hired at Murray State\". ''Kentucky New Era''.

The record was good enough to capture a share of the OVC regular season championship, but the Racer's failed to win the OVC Tournament and earn a spot in the NCAA Tournament. Murray State home court winning streak, the longest in the nation, also came to an end in 2000 with a January 15 loss to [[Southeast Missouri State University]].\n\nOver the next three years under Anderson, the success of the Racer basketball program steadily declined, culminating in a low point during the 2002\u201303 season. The Racers finished the 2002\u201303 season with a 17-12 record, which was fourth-place in the OVC standings. The fourth-place finish was the worst finish in the OVC standings since the 1986\u201387 season. Amid rumors that Anderson would relinquish his coaching duties at Murray State under pressure from university officials, he resigned from the head coach position in March 2003.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://murrayledger.com/anderson-retires-as-racers-head-coach/article_07d9a74c-dd7b-575b-95a4-23568d84d141.html |title=Anderson retires as Racers' head coach - Murray Ledger & Times: Home |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2003-03-24 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref> Anderson was named as the new head coach at [[Jackson State University]] in April 2003.<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://murrayledger.com/anderson-to-take-over-at-jackson-state/article_a355ded1-0ab3-5b7c-982b-5d678d5c2169.html |title=Anderson to take over at Jackson State - Murray Ledger & Times: Home |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2003-04-09 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref>\n\n===Cronin era (2003\u20132006)===\nPreviously an assistant at [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati]] (1997\u20132001) under [[Bob Huggins]] and at [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]] (2001\u201303) under [[Rick Pitino]], Mick Cronin was introduced as the new head coach of the Racers on April 5, 2003. When he accepted the position, Cronin became the fourth youngest head coach in NCAA Division-I basketball. In Cronin's first season as head coach, the Racers won the OVC tournament and advanced to the first round of the NCAA Tournament where the Racers fell to No. 5 seeded Illinois. The success of the 2003\u201304 season was also tainted by arrests and suspensions. Just before the start of the 2004 NCAA Tournament, juniors Adam Chiles and Kelvin Brown were arrested on drug charges. Chiles was charged with hindering prosecution and possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, and Brown was charged with theft from an alleged gas drive-off, possession of marijuana, and his second offense of possession of drug paraphernalia. Both were arrested following a 911 hangup call from their apartment in which Chiles was found outside and Brown was found hiding in a closet. Chiles was cleared to play in the tournament, but Brown was suspended indefinitely and later dismissed from the team in April.<ref>\"Drugs, suspension taint Racers' glorious season\". The Murray State News. March 26, 2004. p 1</ref>\n\nProblems continued for the Racers in the 2004\u201305 season. The team's only returning starter, Adam Chiles, was dismissed from the team in November following his second arrest of 2004. Chiles was stopped by Kentucky State Police while driving on [[Western Kentucky Parkway]] near [[Leitchfield, Kentucky]]. Chiles was charged with driving under the influence, possession of marijuana, possession of an open alcoholic beverage container, and speeding. Chiles had averaged 10.1 points and 3.9 assists for the Racers in the previous season. The Racers went on to finish the 2004\u201305 season with a record of 20-10 and a first round loss in the OVC tournament.<ref>\"Murray State dismisses player after arrest\". Portsmouth Daily Times.

This was the first time that any Ohio Valley Conference team had advanced to the 2nd round of the NCAA Tournament since [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders|Middle Tennessee]] advanced in 1989. The Racers followed up a regular season conference championship for the second year in a row in 2011. The Racers were eliminated from the OVC tournament in 2011; however, they earned a number six seed in the [[National Invitational Tournament]] where the Racers suffered a first round loss to [[Missouri State University]].

The team's 23-0 start under Prohm was the best start to a season in team history. The 23-0 start beat the previous best start record of 16-0 set by the 1935\u201336 men's basketball team under [[Carlisle Cutchin]].
