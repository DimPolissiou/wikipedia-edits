This line-up lasted only for the [[The Golden Palominos (album)|first record]], although all of the core members apart from Zorn were guests on subsequent Palominos recordings.\n\n===1985\u20131989===\n\n[[Image:AmandaKramer(by Scott Dudelson).jpg|thumb|238px|right|[[Amanda Kramer]] - Former Golden Palaminos singer in Concert in 2009]]\nThe Palominos' next album, 1985's ''[[Visions of Excess]]'', sounded vastly different.  Of the band members that were on the first album, only Fier, Laswell and Arto Lindsay  remained.\n''Visions of Excess'' also marked the debut of singer [[Syd Straw]],<ref name=\"Brennan\"/> whose songwriting and vocals were featured prominently, as well as on the group's next album.  [[Michael Stipe]], [[John Lydon]] and [[Jack Bruce]] took turns on lead vocals, while [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]] and [[Jody Harris]] were featured on lead guitar.\n\n''[[Blast of Silence (Axed My Baby for a Nickel)]]'' was released the following year, continuing in much the same vein as ''Visions of Excess'' and with appearances by many of the same personnel. It included covers of two songs written by [[Little Feat]]'s Lowell George, both sung by Syd Straw. The record also featured prominent guest appearances by [[Peter Blegvad]], [[Matthew Sweet]], [[Don Dixon (musician)|Don Dixon]], [[Peter Holsapple]] and [[T-Bone Burnett]].\n\n''[[A Dead Horse]]'' (1989) carried on in the sound of its predecessors slightly, but some of the songs crossed into a darker, more ambient and ethereal sound that dominated the Palomino records of the 1990s. Syd Straw had moved on and was no longer in the band, with most of the vocals now handled by Amanda Kramer, formerly of the [[dance music]] group [[Information Society (band)|Information Society]]. Fier later was a guest on Straw's first solo record, ''Surprise''.\n\n===1990\u20131995===\n''[[Drunk with Passion]]'' marked the first album not on Celluloid Records, taking cues from some of the darker sounds heard on ''A Dead Horse'' and using more processed and electronic sounds, giving some of its songs an ethereal feel.  This album is arguably more influenced by its guest appearances than are any of the previous albums. Guests included [[H\u00fcsker D\u00fc]]'s [[Bob Mould]] (who formed the band [[Sugar (American band)|Sugar]] the following year), Richard Thompson, and Michael Stipe, who provided (along with a forceful solo by Thompson) one of the band's finer moments, the opening track \"[[Alive and Living Now]]\".  Nicky Skopelitis also became more of a cornerstone of the band, contributing to the bulk of ''Drunk with Passion'''s songs along with Fier and Kramer. In 1992, Fier released his first solo record, ''Dreamspeed'', which is partially a reworking of the Palomino's next album, ''This Is How It Feels''.<ref name=\"Brennan\"/>\n\n''[[This Is How It Feels (album)|This Is How It Feels]]'', released on [[Restless Records]] in 1993, continued the ambient sound of ''Drunk with Passion'', but also incorporated elements of club and trance music.  It also marked the introduction of new lead vocalist [[Lori Carson]], who co-wrote nine of the CD's tracks with Anton Fier.  Bill Laswell also returned to contribute on this record, and his production work on this and on the following record, ''Pure'', heavily influenced Laswell's own remix work of the late 1990s, as seen on the CDs ''Emerald Ather'' and ''City of Light''.  The album also contains the first cover song since ''Blast of Silence'', an ethereal, drum-machine-laced re-interpretation of [[Jackson Browne]]'s \"[[These Days (Jackson Browne song)|These Days]]\".  To further highlight the album's dance elements, an EP of remixes of songs from ''This Is How It Feels'' , entitled ''Prison of the Rhythm'', was released shortly after the CD's release.\n\n''[[Pure (The Golden Palominos album)|Pure]]'', released a year later, is seen by many as the band's most focused work, owing much to the strong contributions once again of Carson, Laswell, and Skopelitis. Tracks such as \"No Skin\" and \"Pure\" continue in the dance/ambient style of the previous album.  The CD also stirred a minor controversy over the bare female breast on its cover, with some stores carrying a version of the CD with a booklet and the cover replaced by simple, text-based artwork.  Another remix EP (''No Thought, No Breath, No Eyes, No Heart'') accompanied ''Pure'''s release.\n\n''Pure'' was also the last Palominos record for Lori Carson. However, the song \"Little Suicides\", from ''Pure'' showed the same sparse sound, production, and strong yet quiet vocals (albeit less electronic) that influenced Carson's solo work.  Anton Fier produced Carson's 1995 solo record, ''Where It Goes''.\n\n1994 also saw the release of what was essentially Fier's second solo recording, ''Absence of Time'' (released under the moniker [[Blind Light]]), which used outtakes from ''Pure'' for much of its framework.\n\n===1995\u20132000===\n''[[Dead Inside (album)|Dead Inside]]'' (1996) was another stylistic turnaround for the Palominos, and their last proper album.  This record had a deathly, [[Industrial music|industrial]] sound, with the line-up consisting only of Fier, [[multi-instrumentalist]] [[Knox Chandler]] (who before joining the Palominos, was also in a band with Lori Carson), Nicky Skopelitis, and poet [[Nicole Blackman]]. Blackman's dark and deliberate lyrics (tellingly, Blackman had also recently worked with the industrial German band [[KMFDM]]) made ''Dead Inside'' a challenging record; its sound and tone stand out as decidedly unlike any of the others. The album's opener is a brutal, spoken-word track, \"Victim\", which details a woman's thoughts as she is abducted and eventually murdered by her kidnapper.\n\nIn 1997, The Palominos released another EP, named ''Dead Outside'', composed of five remixes of tracks from ''Dead Inside''. The EP, in a novelty for its time, was released as free [[MP3]]s on the Internet, made available via Nicole Blackman's website and through a fan-created band appreciation website (since decommissioned).  The EP consisted of five remixes, each released sequentially for download from the sites for one month only, as per Fier's instructions:\n\n# ''Victim: The Last Thing'' by [[Sean Beavan]] (whose credits include [[8mm (band)|8MM]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], & [[Marilyn Manson]]) with John Van Eaton\n# ''Ride: Pragmatic Spasmatic'' by [[Raymond Watts]] (of KMFDM & Pig)\n# ''Belfast: Empty As Wire'' by [[Robin Rimbaud|Scanner]] (a frequent Blackman collaborator)\n# ''Ride'' remixed by [[Mark Walk]] (of [[Ruby (British band)|Ruby]])\n# ''Victim: Interference'' by John Van Eaton (another Blackman collaborator who also worked with NiN for 10 years)'''\n\n===2000-present===\n\nAfter the turn of the millennium, the band went on hiatus.  Both Syd Straw and Lori Carson have gone on to moderately successful and [[critic]]ally acclaimed solo careers, with Carson a frequent contributor to television shows and movies.  A compilation of some of Carson's contributed songs, called ''Stolen Beauty'', was released by [[Rykodisc]] in 2003, and her last solo record, ''The Finest Thing'', was released in 2004.  She intends to have a new record, entitled ''Another Year'', out in March 2012, and has a book scheduled to be published in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last=Carson|first=Lori|title=Maybe|url=http://lifeandmusic.loricarson.com/?p=381|work=lori carson life and music|publisher=Lori Carson|accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nAnton Fier re-appeared on the music scene in 2009, producing [[Drivin N Cryin|Drivin' 'n' Cryin']]s album ''[[The Great American Bubble Factory]]'',<ref name=\"Jurek\">{{cite web|last=Jurek|first=Thom|title=A Good Country Mile review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/a-good-country-mile-r2385041/review|work=allmusic.com|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=21 February 2012}}</ref> which was the band's first album in 12 years.\n\nIn 2010, the Golden Palominos played two shows in New York City: a May 7 show at Le Poisson Rouge, and a May 11 show at The Living Room.

A few best-of compilations are available: two ''A History'' collections on Celluloid both released in 1992; a German collection released in 1997; and 2002's collection ''Run Pony Run''. However, none include any material from ''Drunk with Passion'' onward.  The later albums on Restless are growing harder to find on CD, with the earliest CDs on Celluloid and ''Drunk with Passion'' being nearly non-existent.  (''Dreamspeed'' is also extremely rare in its original release and is a prized possession of Fier aficionados.  However, Fier re-released it and his other solo record, ''Absence of Time'', on John Zorn's [[Tzadik Records|Tzadik]] label in late 2003.)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060905063615/http://launch.yahoo.com/ar-250140-bio--The-Golden-Palominos Profile at Yahoo!

Syd Straw had moved on and was no longer in the band, with most of the vocals now handled by Amanda Kramer, formerly of the [[dance music]] group [[Information Society (band)|Information Society]]. Fier later was a guest on Straw's first solo record, ''Surprise''.\n\n===1990\u20131995===\n''[[Drunk with Passion]]'' marked the first album not on Celluloid Records, taking cues from some of the darker sounds heard on ''A Dead Horse'' and using more processed and electronic sounds, giving some of its songs an ethereal feel.  This album is arguably more influenced by its guest appearances than are any of the previous albums. Guests included [[H\u00fcsker D\u00fc]]'s [[Bob Mould]] (who formed the band [[Sugar (American band)|Sugar]] the following year), Richard Thompson, and Michael Stipe, who provided (along with a forceful solo by Thompson) one of the band's finer moments, the opening track \"[[Alive and Living Now]]\".  Nicky Skopelitis also became more of a cornerstone of the band, contributing to the bulk of ''Drunk with Passion'''s songs along with Fier and Kramer. In 1992, Fier released his first solo record, ''Dreamspeed'', which is partially a reworking of the Palomino's next album, ''This Is How It Feels''.<ref name=\"Brennan\"/>\n\n''[[This Is How It Feels (album)|This Is How It Feels]]'', released on [[Restless Records]] in 1993, continued the ambient sound of ''Drunk with Passion'', but also incorporated elements of club and trance music.  It also marked the introduction of new lead vocalist [[Lori Carson]], who co-wrote nine of the CD's tracks with Anton Fier.  Bill Laswell also returned to contribute on this record, and his production work on this and on the following record, ''Pure'', heavily influenced Laswell's own remix work of the late 90's, as seen on the CDs ''Emerald Ather'' and ''City of Light''.  The album also contains the first cover song since ''Blast of Silence'', an ethereal, drum-machine-laced re-interpretation of [[Jackson Browne]]'s \"[[These Days (Jackson Browne song)|These Days]]\".  To further highlight the album's dance elements, an EP of remixes of songs from ''This Is How It Feels'' , entitled ''Prison of the Rhythm'', was released shortly after the CD's release.\n\n''[[Pure (The Golden Palominos album)|Pure]]'', released a year later, is seen by many as the band's most focused work, owing much to the strong contributions once again of Carson, Laswell, and Skopelitis. Tracks such as \"No Skin\" and \"Pure\" continue in the dance/ambient style of the previous album.  The CD also stirred a minor controversy over the bare female breast on its cover, with some stores carrying a version of the CD with a booklet and the cover replaced by simple, text-based artwork.  Another remix EP (''No Thought, No Breath, No Eyes, No Heart'') accompanied ''Pure'''s release.\n\n''Pure'' was also the last Palominos record for Lori Carson. However, the song \"Little Suicides\", from ''Pure'' showed the same sparse sound, production, and strong yet quiet vocals (albeit less electronic) that influenced Carson's solo work.  Anton Fier produced Carson's 1995 solo record, ''Where It Goes''.\n\n1994 also saw the release of what was essentially Fier's second solo recording, ''Absence of Time'' (released under the moniker [[Blind Light]]), which used outtakes from ''Pure'' for much of its framework.\n\n===1995\u20132000===\n''[[Dead Inside (album)|Dead Inside]]'' (1996) was another stylistic turnaround for the Palominos, and their last proper album.  This record had a deathly, [[Industrial music|industrial]] sound, with the line-up consisting only of Fier, [[multi-instrumentalist]] [[Knox Chandler]] (who before joining the Palominos, was also in a band with Lori Carson), Nicky Skopelitis, and poet [[Nicole Blackman]]. Blackman's dark and deliberate lyrics (tellingly, Blackman had also recently worked with the industrial German band [[KMFDM]]) made ''Dead Inside'' a challenging record; its sound and tone stand out as decidedly unlike any of the others. The album's opener is a brutal, spoken-word track, \"Victim\", which details a woman's thoughts as she is abducted and eventually murdered by her kidnapper.\n\nIn 1997, The Palominos released another EP, named ''Dead Outside'', composed of five remixes of tracks from ''Dead Inside''. The EP, in a novelty for its time, was released as free [[MP3]]s on the Internet, made available via Nicole Blackman's website and through a fan-created band appreciation website (since decommissioned).  The EP consisted of five remixes, each released sequentially for download from the sites for one month only, as per Fier's instructions:\n\n# ''Victim: The Last Thing'' by [[Sean Beavan]] (whose credits include [[8mm (band)|8MM]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], & [[Marilyn Manson]]) with John Van Eaton\n# ''Ride: Pragmatic Spasmatic'' by [[Raymond Watts]] (of KMFDM & Pig)\n# ''Belfast: Empty As Wire'' by [[Robin Rimbaud|Scanner]] (a frequent Blackman collaborator)\n# ''Ride'' remixed by [[Mark Walk]] (of [[Ruby (British band)|Ruby]])\n# ''Victim: Interference'' by John Van Eaton (another Blackman collaborator who also worked with NiN for 10 years)'''\n\n===2000-present===\n\nAfter the turn of the millennium, the band went on hiatus.  Both Syd Straw and Lori Carson have gone on to moderately successful and [[critic]]ally acclaimed solo careers, with Carson a frequent contributor to television shows and movies.  A compilation of some of Carson's contributed songs, called ''Stolen Beauty'', was released by [[Rykodisc]] in 2003, and her last solo record, ''The Finest Thing'', was released in 2004.  She intends to have a new record, entitled ''Another Year'', out in March 2012, and has a book scheduled to be published in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last=Carson|first=Lori|title=Maybe|url=http://lifeandmusic.loricarson.com/?p=381|work=lori carson life and music|publisher=Lori Carson|accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nAnton Fier re-appeared on the music scene in 2009, producing [[Drivin N Cryin|Drivin' 'n' Cryin']]s album ''[[The Great American Bubble Factory]]'',<ref name=\"Jurek\">{{cite web|last=Jurek|first=Thom|title=A Good Country Mile review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/a-good-country-mile-r2385041/review|work=allmusic.com|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=21 February 2012}}</ref> which was the band's first album in 12 years.\n\nIn 2010, the Golden Palominos played two shows in New York City: a May 7 show at Le Poisson Rouge, and a May 11 show at The Living Room.

A few best-of compilations are available: two ''A History'' collections on Celluloid both released in 1992; a German collection released in 1997; and 2002's collection ''Run Pony Run''. However, none include any material from ''Drunk with Passion'' onward.  The later albums on Restless are growing harder to find on CD, with the earliest CDs on Celluloid and ''Drunk with Passion'' being nearly non-existent.  (''Dreamspeed'' is also extremely rare in its original release and is a prized possession of Fier aficionados.  However, Fier re-released it and his other solo record, ''Absence of Time'', on John Zorn's [[Tzadik Records|Tzadik]] label in late 2003.)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060905063615/http://launch.yahoo.com/ar-250140-bio--The-Golden-Palominos Profile at Yahoo!
