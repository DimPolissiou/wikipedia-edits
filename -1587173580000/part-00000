They are known as the [[Plano culture|Plano]], and they used stone-tipped spears to hunt [[caribou]] on the northwestern side of Lake Minong.\n\nThe next documented people are known as the Shield Archaic (c. 5000\u2013500&nbsp;BC). Evidence of this culture can be found at the eastern and western ends of the Canadian shore. They used bows and arrows, dugout canoes, fished, hunted, mined copper for tools and weapons, and established trading networks. They are believed to be the direct ancestors of the Ojibwe and [[Cree]].<ref name=\"Chisholm & Gutsche, p. xvi\">{{harvp|Chisholm|Gutsche|1998|p= xvi}}.</ref>\n\nThe Laurel people (c. 500 BC to AD 500) developed [[seine net]] fishing, evidence being found at rivers around Superior such as the Pic and Michipicoten.\n\n[[File:AgawaRock23.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pictograph]]s at [[Lake Superior Provincial Park]], Ontario]]\nAnother culture known as the Terminal Woodland Indians (c. AD 900\u20131650) has been found. They were [[Algonquian peoples|Algonkian]] people who hunted, fished and gathered berries. They used [[Snowshoe|snow shoes]], [[birch bark]] canoes and conical or domed lodges. At the mouth of the Michipicoten River, nine layers of encampments have been discovered. Most of the [[Pukaskwa Pit]]s were likely made during this time.<ref name=\"Chisholm & Gutsche, p. xvi\"/>\n\nThe [[Anishinaabe]], which includes the Ojibwe or [[Chippewa]], have inhabited the Lake Superior region for over five hundred years and were preceded by the [[Lakota people|Dakota]], [[Fox (tribe)|Fox]], [[Menominee]], Nipigon, Noquet and [[Gros Ventres]]. They called Lake Superior either ''Ojibwe Gichigami'' (\"the Ojibwe's Great Sea\") or ''Anishnaabe Gichgamiing'' (\"the Anishinaabe's Great Sea\"). After the arrival of Europeans, the Anishinaabe made themselves the middle-men between the French [[fur trade]]rs and other Native peoples. They soon became the dominant Native American nation in the region: they forced out the [[Sioux]] and Fox and won a victory against the [[Iroquois]] west of Sault Ste. Marie in 1662. By the mid-18th century, the Ojibwe occupied all of Lake Superior's shores.<ref>{{harvp|Chisholm|Gutsche|1998|p= xvii}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:050820 GrandPortageNationalMonument.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed Great Hall, [[Grand Portage National Monument]], Minnesota]]\nIn the 18th century, the fur trade in the region was booming, with the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] having a virtual monopoly until 1783, when the [[North West Company]] was formed to rival the Hudson's Bay Company. The North West Company built forts on Lake Superior at [[Grand Portage]], [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]], Nipigon, the Pic River, the Michipicoten River, and Sault Ste. Marie. But by 1821, with competition taking too great a toll on both, the companies merged under the Hudson's Bay Company name.\n\nMany towns around the lake are either current or former mining areas, or engaged in processing or shipping.

Large cargo vessels called [[lake freighter]]s, as well as smaller ocean-going [[seawaymax|freighters]], transport these commodities across Lake Superior.\n\nShipping was slow to arrive at Lake Superior in the 19th century.

Evidence of this culture can be found at the eastern and western ends of the Canadian shore. They used bows and arrows, dugout canoes, fished, hunted, mined copper for tools and weapons, and established trading networks.

They called Lake Superior either ''Ojibwe Gichigami'' (\"the Ojibwe's Great Sea\") or ''Anishnaabe Gichgamiing'' (\"the Anishinaabe's Great Sea\"). After the arrival of Europeans, the Anishinaabe made themselves the middle-men between the French [[fur trade]]rs and other Native peoples. They soon became the dominant Native American nation in the region: they forced out the [[Sioux]] and Fox and won a victory against the [[Iroquois]] west of Sault Ste. Marie in 1662.
