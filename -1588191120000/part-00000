It may also extend to neighbouring countries or regions that are populated by peoples over which Russia ruled (e.g. [[Iranian Azerbaijan]] in [[Iran]]), or peoples which are closely related to them due to linguistic, ethnic or religious ties. Historically, Russia has pursued all of these avenues; examples include the [[Panslavism]] movement to put all of the [[Balkans]] (where there exists Slavic and [[Eastern Orthodox]] majorities) under Russian hegemony; the [[Moscow, third Rome|Third Rome]] philosophy, which focused on re-claiming the former [[Byzantine Empire]] regions (in particular the warm winter port of [[Constantinople]], today [[Istanbul]]), and in addition establishing a hegemony over [[Greater Armenia (political concept)|Greater Armenia]] and the [[Holy Land]] ([[Lebanon]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] etc.). Simultaneously, there were ambitions to continue expansion into [[Persia]] and even [[India]] (see [[The Great Game]]). The Russian Empire also planned to force [[Qing Dynasty|Qing China]] to cede [[Xinjiang]], [[Manchuria]], [[Mongolia|Outer Mongolia]], and [[Korea]]. While the [[Russo-Japanese War]] ended most of these prospects, the Soviet Union would eventually create a sphere of influence in this area in the form of the [[Mongolian People's Republic]] and the [[Tuvan People's Republic]]. Finally, in [[Russian America]], Russia held claims extending from the [[Aleutian Islands]] to northern [[California]], but these plans were cancelled after Alaska [[Alaska Purchase|was sold to the United States]] in 1867.\n* The intermediate sense includes some or all of the independent countries and/or territories that made up the historical Russian borders. These may include [[Moldova]], [[Ukraine]], eastern [[Poland]], [[Belarus]], the [[Baltic states]], and [[Finland]] in Europe, [[Azerbaijan]], [[Armenia]], and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] in the [[Caucasus]], and [[Kazakhstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], and [[Uzbekistan]] in [[Central Asia]]. Some narrower definitions include only the pro-Russian breakaway states of [[Abkhazia]] (Georgia), [[South Ossetia]] (Georgia), and [[Transnistria]] (Moldova), as well as [[Kars Oblast]] in Turkey and [[Batum Oblast]] partly in Turkey also ([[Ardahan Province]]) and [[Adjara]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].\n* The narrow sense of Russian irredentism focuses only on regions that are populated by [[Russians|ethnic Russians]] that are outside the Russian Federation, such as: [[Narva]] in [[Estonia]]; lands around [[Daugavpils]] and [[Riga]] in [[Latvia]]; [[Sloboda Ukraine]], [[Novorossiya]], and [[Crimea]] from Ukraine (the latter of which has ''de facto'' joined the Federation<ref>{{cite journal|first=Vladimir |last=Socor |author-link=Vladimir Socor |url=http://www.jamestown.org/regions/centralasia/single/?tx_ttnews[tt_news]=42144&tx_ttnews[backPid]=53&cHash=377ed0c543440239db55d887478f2c53#.VyAwZ3rbucw |title=Putin's Crimea Speech: A Manifesto of Greater-Russia Irredentism |journal=Eurasia Daily Monitor |volume=11 |issue=56 |date=25 March 2014 |accessdate=27 April 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427052607/http://www.jamestown.org/programs/edm/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=42144&cHash=7d7b25bd2616f914691c6f7e3b00c3eb |archivedate=27 April 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Saideman|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/why-crimea-is-likely-the-limit-of-greater-russia/article17542819/|title=Why Crimea is likely the limit of Greater Russia|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=18 March 2014|accessdate=27 April 2016}}</ref>); [[Gagra district]] in Georgia (also claimed by [[Abkhazia]]); and lands between the Russian border and the rivers of [[Ural River|Ural]] and [[Irtysh River|Irtysh]] in [[Kazakhstan]], as well as parts of [[Semirechye]].\n\n====Historical and fringe disputes====\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2020}}\nMany fringe and opposition groups in various countries maintain their own set of territorial claims, which are given below:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"130\" | State\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"150\" | Claimed area\n!

It may also extend to neighbouring countries or regions that are populated by peoples over which Russia ruled (e.g. [[Iranian Azerbaijan]] in [[Iran]]), or peoples which are closely related to them due to linguistic, ethnic or religious ties. Historically, Russia has pursued all of these avenues; examples include the [[Panslavism]] movement to put all of the [[Balkans]] (where there exists Slavic and [[Eastern Orthodox]] majorities) under Russian hegemony; the [[Moscow, third Rome|Third Rome]] philosophy, which focused on re-claiming the former [[Byzantine Empire]] regions (in particular the warm winter port of [[Constantinople]], today [[Istanbul]]), and in addition establishing a hegemony over [[Greater Armenia (political concept)|Greater Armenia]] and the [[Holy Land]] ([[Lebanon]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] etc.). Simultaneously, there were ambitions to continue expansion into [[Persia]] and even [[India]] (see [[The Great Game]]). The Russian Empire also planned to force [[Qing Dynasty|Qing China]] to cede [[Xinjiang]], [[Manchuria]], [[Mongolia|Outer Mongolia]], and [[Korea]]. While the [[Russo-Japanese War]] ended most of these prospects, the Soviet Union would eventually create a sphere of influence in this area in the form of the [[Mongolian People's Republic]] and the [[Tuvan People's Republic]]. Finally, in [[Russian America]], Russia held claims extending from the [[Aleutian Islands]] to northern [[California]], but these plans were cancelled after Alaska [[Alaska Purchase|was sold to the United States]] in 1867.\n* The intermediate sense includes some or all of the independent countries and/or territories that made up the historical Russian borders. These may include [[Moldova]], [[Ukraine]], eastern [[Poland]], [[Belarus]], the [[Baltic states]], and [[Finland]] in Europe, [[Azerbaijan]], [[Armenia]], and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] in the [[Caucasus]], and [[Kazakhstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], and [[Uzbekistan]] in [[Central Asia]]. Some narrower definitions include only the pro-Russian breakaway states of [[Abkhazia]] (Georgia), [[South Ossetia]] (Georgia), and [[Transnistria]] (Moldova), as well as [[Kars Oblast]] in Turkey and [[Batum Oblast]] partly in Turkey also ([[Ardahan Province]]) and [[Adjara]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].\n* The narrow sense of Russian irredentism focuses only on regions that are populated by [[Russians|ethnic Russians]] that are outside the Russian Federation, such as: [[Narva]] in [[Estonia]]; lands around [[Daugavpils]] and [[Riga]] in [[Latvia]]; [[Sloboda Ukraine]], [[Novorossiya]], and [[Crimea]] from Ukraine (the latter of which has ''de facto'' joined the Federation<ref>{{cite journal|first=Vladimir |last=Socor |author-link=Vladimir Socor |url=http://www.jamestown.org/regions/centralasia/single/?tx_ttnews[tt_news]=42144&tx_ttnews[backPid]=53&cHash=377ed0c543440239db55d887478f2c53#.VyAwZ3rbucw |title=Putin's Crimea Speech: A Manifesto of Greater-Russia Irredentism |journal=Eurasia Daily Monitor |volume=11 |issue=56 |date=25 March 2014 |accessdate=27 April 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427052607/http://www.jamestown.org/programs/edm/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=42144&cHash=7d7b25bd2616f914691c6f7e3b00c3eb |archivedate=27 April 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Saideman|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/why-crimea-is-likely-the-limit-of-greater-russia/article17542819/|title=Why Crimea is likely the limit of Greater Russia|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=18 March 2014|accessdate=27 April 2016}}</ref>); [[Gagra district]] in Georgia (also claimed by [[Abkhazia]]); and lands between the Russian border and the rivers of [[Ural River|Ural]] and [[Irtysh River|Irtysh]] in [[Kazakhstan]], as well as parts of [[Semirechye]].\n\n====Historical and fringe disputes====\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2020}}\nMany fringe and opposition groups in various countries maintain their own set of territorial claims, which are given below:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"130\" | State\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"150\" | Claimed area\n!

Sadoc Vilarrasa and Bishop [[Joseph Alemany]].  Alemany, who in 1840 completed his studies in sacred theology in Rome at the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] College of St. Thomas, the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']], had been appointed Bishop of [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] and invited Fr. Vilarrasa to accompany him to [[California]].  On his way to his new post in California Alemany stopped in Paris and asked  Dominican sisters to join him to teach the children of the [[California Gold Rush|Forty-niners]]. Mary Goemaere (1809-1891) volunteered to accompany the new bishop and to begin a school in his new diocese. Within three years, nine women (three American, one Mexican, and five Spanish) joined Sister Mary to form the Congregation of the Most Holy Name.  The province was soon reduced to a self-governing Congregation.  Finally in 1912, the congregation was formally re-erected as a province,<ref>Article \"Dominicans\" by W.A. Hinnebusch, P.

In whatever lifestyle they find themselves, married or single, Lay Dominicans enrich the Dominican Family with their passion for the Truth, their love of Dominican prayer and apostolic zeal.\n\nLay Dominicans have a direct role in the preaching mission. Many pursue degrees in theology or liturgy, are engaged in justice ministries and fully participate in St. Dominic's call to contemplate and share with others the fruits of contemplation.. Lay Dominicans preach primarily in the marketplace or wherever our station in life finds us. We preach by our lives and example, and when opportunity arises, with our voices as well. Dominican Lay men and women pursue study, particularly in theology, Scripture, and catechesis in order to preach well when called upon to do so.\n\nThe Lay Dominicans make promises to follow The Rule of the Lay Chapters of St. Dominic and the Particular Directory of the Province in which they live. They meet in community regularly and participate with the friars, nuns, and sisters, as well as the Church in general, in praying the Liturgy of the Hours. They engage in active apostolates such as letter-writing on issues of peace and justice, ministry to the poor, liturgical ministries, teaching, authorship, and spiritual counseling. They endeavor to live lives of simplicity and generosity.<ref>[http://www.domlife.org/beingdominican/WhoWeAre/Laity.htm ''Dominican Life USA'': \"Who are Lay Dominicans\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121230095255/http://www.domlife.org/beingdominican/WhoWeAre/Laity.htm |date=December 30, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Dominican Young Adults, USA==\nIn the summer of 2008, members who attended the Preaching in Action College conference, held a reunion at Edgewood College in Madison, WI.

Sadoc Vilarrasa and Bishop [[Joseph Alemany]].  Alemany, who in 1840 completed his studies in sacred theology in Rome at the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] College of St. Thomas, the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']], had been appointed Bishop of [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] and invited Fr. Vilarrasa to accompany him to [[California]].  On his way to his new post in California Alemany stopped in Paris and asked  Dominican sisters to join him to teach the children of the [[California Gold Rush|Forty-niners]]. Mary Goemaere (1809-1891) volunteered to accompany the new bishop and to begin a school in his new diocese. Within three years, nine women (three American, one Mexican, and five Spanish) joined Sister Mary to form the Congregation of the Most Holy Name.  The province was soon reduced to a self-governing Congregation.  Finally in 1912, the congregation was formally re-erected as a province,<ref>Article \"Dominicans\" by W.A. Hinnebusch, P.

In whatever lifestyle they find themselves, married or single, Lay Dominicans enrich the Dominican Family with their passion for the Truth, their love of Dominican prayer and apostolic zeal.\n\nLay Dominicans have a direct role in the preaching mission. Many pursue degrees in theology or liturgy, are engaged in justice ministries and fully participate in St. Dominic's call to contemplate and share with others the fruits of contemplation.. Lay Dominicans preach primarily in the marketplace or wherever our station in life finds us. We preach by our lives and example, and when opportunity arises, with our voices as well. Dominican Lay men and women pursue study, particularly in theology, Scripture, and catechesis in order to preach well when called upon to do so.\n\nThe Lay Dominicans make promises to follow The Rule of the Lay Chapters of St. Dominic and the Particular Directory of the Province in which they live. They meet in community regularly and participate with the friars, nuns, and sisters, as well as the Church in general, in praying the Liturgy of the Hours. They engage in active apostolates such as letter-writing on issues of peace and justice, ministry to the poor, liturgical ministries, teaching, authorship, and spiritual counseling. They endeavor to live lives of simplicity and generosity.<ref>[http://www.domlife.org/beingdominican/WhoWeAre/Laity.htm ''Dominican Life USA'': \"Who are Lay Dominicans\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121230095255/http://www.domlife.org/beingdominican/WhoWeAre/Laity.htm |date=December 30, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Dominican Young Adults, USA==\nIn the summer of 2008, members who attended the Preaching in Action College conference, held a reunion at Edgewood College in Madison, WI.  While there, work was done to form the Dominican Young Adults, USA (DYA, USA).  Local chapters are present in Dominican colleges, universities, parishes, and other local areas with Dominican influence.  Local chapters of 18- to 30-year-olds center meetings around the four pillars of Dominican life: Community, Prayer, Study, and Preaching/Mission.  They have a mentor who is a member of the Dominican Family.  Each chapter also has a young adult leader.  Every two years, national gatherings are held.
