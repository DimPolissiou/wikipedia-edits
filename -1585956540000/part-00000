The title track of Bowie's [[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|third album]], it was released in November 1970 in the US and in April 1971 in the UK. The song has been covered by a number of other artists, notably by [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], who had a UK No. 3 hit with her version in 1974; by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], whose 1993 performance of the song for the television program ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' introduced it to a new audience; and by [[Midge Ure]], whose 1982 cover of the song was featured in the 2015 video game ''[[Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain]]'' because the game itself features the song's main theme of doppelg\u00e4ngers.\n\nThe song was reworked by Bowie, featuring atmospheric synths, a new bassline, techno-style drums and a notably darker mood, for performances in concerts from 1995 to 1997, including the [[1995 MTV Europe Music Awards]]. Bowie later returned to playing the original version in the 2000s.\n\n==Recording==\nThe backing track for \"The Man Who Sold the World\" was recorded at [[Trident Studios]] in London on 4 May 1970, along with other album track \"Running Gun Blues\". At this point, the track was recorded under the working title \"Saviour Machine\" and did not contain the title phrase.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=191\u2013192}} According to producer [[Tony Visconti]], Bowie recorded his vocal on 22 May at [[Advision Studios]], the final day of mixing for the album which, when traveling to Advision, Bowie had intended to name ''Metrobolist'', an homage to [[Fritz Lang]]'s 1927 film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=193}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=316}} Bowie's last-minute addition frustrated Visconti, who recalled in 1977: \"This was the beginning of [Bowie's] new style of writing \u2013 'I can't be bothered until I have to'. When it was finished, on the last day of the last mix, I remember telling David, 'I've had it, I can't work like this anymore \u2013 I'm through...David was very disappointed.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=193\u2013194}} This frustration was mostly due in part to his dissatisfaction with the recording sessions: he was mostly in charge of budget and production, as well as maintaining Bowie's interest in the project. Bowie later told [[BBC Radio 1]]'s Stuart Grundy in 1976: \"It was a nightmare, that album. I hated the actual process of making it.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=210}}\n\n==Lyrics==\nThe person in the song has an encounter with a kind of [[doppelg\u00e4nger]], as suggested in the second chorus where \"I never lost control\" is replaced with \"We never lost control\".<ref>{{Cite book| contribution = Future Legends: David Bowie and Science Fiction| last = King| first = Maureen| editor-last = Morrison| editor-first = Michael A.| title = Trajectories of the Fantastic: Selected Essays from the Fourteenth International Conference on the Fantastic in the Arts| publisher = Greenwood| year = 1997| location = Westport, CT| page = 131 }}</ref> Beyond this, the episode is unexplained: as James E. Perone wrote,\n\n{{quote|Bowie encounters the title character, but it is not clear just what the phrase means, or exactly who this man is.&nbsp;... The main thing that the song does is to paint \u2013 however elusively \u2013 the title character as another example of the societal outcasts who populate the album.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Perone| first = James E.| title = The Words and Music of David Bowie| publisher = Praeger| year = 2007| location = Westport, Connecticut| pages = 15\u201316}}</ref>}}\n\nIn common with a number of tracks on the album, the song's themes have been compared to the [[Horror fiction|horror]]-[[fantasy]] works of [[H. P. Lovecraft]].{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=38}} The lyrics are also cited as reflecting Bowie's concerns with splintered or multiple personalities, and are believed to have been partially inspired by the poem \"[[Antigonish (poem)|Antigonish]]\" by [[William Hughes Mearns]]:{{sfn|Buckley|1999|p=100}}<ref name=\"Thompson AllMusic\">{{cite web |last1=Thompson |first1=Dave |title=\"The Man Who Sold the World\" \u2013 David Bowie |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/the-man-who-sold-the-world-mt0052219335 |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n{{poemquote|Last night I saw upon the stair\nA little man who wasn't there\nHe wasn't there again today\nOh, how I wish he'd go away...}}\n\nIn the [[BBC Radio 1]] special programme ''ChangesNowBowie'', broadcast on 8 January 1997, Bowie was interviewed by Mary Anne Hobbs and was asked about the song. He commented: \"I guess I wrote it because there was a part of myself that I was looking for. Maybe now that I feel more comfortable with the way that I live my life and my mental state (laughs) and my spiritual state whatever, maybe I feel there's some kind of unity now. That song for me always exemplified kind of how you feel when you're young, when you know that there's a piece of yourself that you haven't really put together yet.

He was \u00fcbercool at the time and I just wanted to be led by him. I loved everything he did. I didn't think 'The Man Who Sold the World' was the greatest song for my voice, but it was such a strong song in itself. I had no idea what it was about.

The title track of Bowie's [[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|third album]], it was released in November 1970 in the US and in April 1971 in the UK. The song has been covered by a number of other artists, notably by [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], who had a UK No. 3 hit with her version in 1974; by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], whose 1993 performance of the song for the television program ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' introduced it to a new audience; and by [[Midge Ure]], whose 1982 cover of the song was featured in the 2015 video game ''[[Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain]]'' because the game itself features the song's main theme of doppelg\u00e4ngers.\n\nThe song was reworked by Bowie, featuring atmospheric synths, a new bassline, techno-style drums and a notably darker mood, for performances in concerts from 1995 to 1997, including the [[1995 MTV Europe Music Awards]]. Bowie later returned to playing the original version in the 2000s.\n\n==Recording==\nThe backing track for \"The Man Who Sold the World\" was recorded at [[Trident Studios]] in London on 4 May 1970, along with other album track \"Running Gun Blues\". At this point, the track was recorded under the working title \"Saviour Machine\" and did not contain the title phrase.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=191\u2013192}} According to producer [[Tony Visconti]], Bowie recorded his vocal on 22 May at [[Advision Studios]], the final day of mixing for the album which, when traveling to Advision, Bowie had intended to name ''Metrobolist'', an homage to [[Fritz Lang]]'s 1927 film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=193}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=316}} Bowie's last-minute addition frustrated Visconti, who recalled in 1977: \"This was the beginning of [Bowie's] new style of writing \u2013 'I can't be bothered until I have to'. When it was finished, on the last day of the last mix, I remember telling David, 'I've had it, I can't work like this anymore \u2013 I'm through...David was very disappointed.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=193\u2013194}} This frustration was mostly due in part to his dissatisfaction with the recording sessions: he was mostly in charge of budget and production, as well as maintaining Bowie's interest in the project. Bowie later told BBC Radio One's Stuart Grundy in 1976: \"It was a nightmare, that album. I hated the actual process of making it.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=210}}\n\n==Lyrics==\nThe person in the song has an encounter with a kind of [[doppelg\u00e4nger]], as suggested in the second chorus where \"I never lost control\" is replaced with \"We never lost control\".<ref>{{Cite book| contribution = Future Legends: David Bowie and Science Fiction| last = King| first = Maureen| editor-last = Morrison| editor-first = Michael A.| title = Trajectories of the Fantastic: Selected Essays from the Fourteenth International Conference on the Fantastic in the Arts| publisher = Greenwood| year = 1997| location = Westport, CT| page = 131 }}</ref> Beyond this, the episode is unexplained: as James E. Perone wrote,\n\n{{quote|Bowie encounters the title character, but it is not clear just what the phrase means, or exactly who this man is.&nbsp;... The main thing that the song does is to paint \u2013 however elusively \u2013 the title character as another example of the societal outcasts who populate the album.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Perone| first = James E.| title = The Words and Music of David Bowie| publisher = Praeger| year = 2007| location = Westport, Connecticut| pages = 15\u201316}}</ref>}}\n\nIn common with a number of tracks on the album, the song's themes have been compared to the [[Horror fiction|horror]]-[[fantasy]] works of [[H. P. Lovecraft]].{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=38}} The lyrics are also cited as reflecting Bowie's concerns with splintered or multiple personalities, and are believed to have been partially inspired by the poem \"[[Antigonish (poem)|Antigonish]]\" by [[William Hughes Mearns]]:{{sfn|Buckley|1999|p=100}}<ref name=\"Thompson AllMusic\">{{cite web |last1=Thompson |first1=Dave |title=\"The Man Who Sold the World\" \u2013 David Bowie |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/the-man-who-sold-the-world-mt0052219335 |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n{{poemquote|Last night I saw upon the stair\nA little man who wasn't there\nHe wasn't there again today\nOh, how I wish he'd go away...}}\n\nIn the [[BBC Radio 1]] special programme ''ChangesNowBowie'', broadcast on 8 January 1997, Bowie was interviewed by Mary Anne Hobbs and was asked about the song. He commented: \"I guess I wrote it because there was a part of myself that I was looking for. Maybe now that I feel more comfortable with the way that I live my life and my mental state (laughs) and my spiritual state whatever, maybe I feel there's some kind of unity now. That song for me always exemplified kind of how you feel when you're young, when you know that there's a piece of yourself that you haven't really put together yet. You have this great searching, this great need to find out who you really are.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.teenagewildlife.com/Appearances/Radio/1997/0108/radio1-transcript.html |title=ChangesNowBowie Transcript \u2013 Radio 1 |first=Grant |last=Wallace |date=27 June 1999 |accessdate=19 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902074027/http://www.teenagewildlife.com/Appearances/Radio/1997/0108/radio1-transcript.html |archive-date=2 September 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Other releases by Bowie==\n*\"The Man Who Sold the World\" appeared as the B-side on the American single release of the song  \"[[Space Oddity]]\" (1973 rerelease) and British single \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" (1973).<ref name=\"1973 US single liner notes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=''\"Space Oddity\"''|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1973|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=US|type=Single liner notes|id=74-0876}}</ref><ref name=\"1973 UK single liner notes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=''\"Life on Mars?\"''|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1973|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=Single liner notes|id=RCA 2316}}</ref> It also appears on various Bowie compilations such as ''[[Sound + Vision (box set)|Sound + Vision]]'' (1989), ''[[The Best of David Bowie 1969/1974]]'' (1997), ''[[Best of Bowie]]'' (2002), ''[[The Platinum Collection (David Bowie album)|The Platinum Collection]]'' (2006), ''[[Nothing Has Changed]]'' (2014), and ''[[Bowie Legacy]]'' (2016).\n*On 15 December 1979, Bowie recorded the song for a ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' broadcast, with [[Klaus Nomi]] and [[Joey Arias]].

He was \u00fcbercool at the time and I just wanted to be led by him. I loved everything he did. I didn't think 'The Man Who Sold the World' was the greatest song for my voice, but it was such a strong song in itself. I had no idea what it was about. In the studio Bowie kept telling me to smoke more cigarettes, to give my voice a certain quality.\"{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=228}} Bowie produced the Lulu recording of \"The Man Who Sold the World\" with [[Mick Ronson]] during the July 1973 ''[[Pin Ups]]'' sessions and also contributed guitar, [[saxophone]] and backing vocals. The remainder of the band included Ronson on guitar, [[Trevor Bolder]] on bass, [[Mike Garson]] on piano, and [[Aynsley Dunbar]] on drums.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=118}}\n\nLulu's \"The Man Who Sold the World\" was released as a [[music single|single]] on 11 January 1974 having been introduced by Lulu on the ''[[Top of the Pops|TOTP]]'' broadcast of 10 January 1974: the track only made its Top 50 debut (at #27) on the chart dated 26 January 1974 following a reprise performance by Lulu on ''TOTP'' two days earlier on 24 January 1974, with a third ''TOTP'' performance by Lulu on 7 February 1974 broadcast facilitating a boost from No. 13 to No. 5 on the chart dated 9 February 1974.

Specifically, the game is most similar to later entries in the series such as ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour|World Tour]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock|Warriors of Rock]]'', using [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] assets from those games. Gameplay involves pressing colored buttons on a [[guitar]]-shaped controller to play along to songs, although in ''Clone Hero'' these inputs can be mapped to a keyboard or any other input device. Players must hold specific buttons that line up with colored notes that appear on the screen on a \"highway\"; when the notes hit the bottom of the highway, the player must strum to hit the notes in time with the music. There is also an \"open strum\" note, represented with a purple bar, which requires the player to strum without pressing any other buttons. In addition to normal notes, there are \"HOPO\"s (\"[[Hammer-on|Hammer-ons]]\" and \"[[Pull-off|Pull-offs]]\") and \"tap notes\", which both do not require the player to strum them to hit them, with the difference between the two being that a string of HOPOs must begin with a strum, and the player must re-strum if they miss a note. Unlike the ''Guitar Hero'' series, by default there is no penalty for missing notes, aside from breaking a combo, making it impossible to fail a song, although there is an option to enable this. The game also contains a mode which emulates the gameplay of ''[[Guitar Hero Live]]'', which is notably different from other games in the series, as well as support for drum-based charts.\n\n''Clone Hero'' has the ability to play community-made songs, called \"charts\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-05-01-meet-the-community-reviving-classic-guitar-hero-gameplay-in-their-own-clone|title=The spirit of Guitar Hero lives on in a bizarre community-made clone|last=Stubbs|first=Mike|date=2018-05-01|website=Eurogamer|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200403231817/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-05-01-meet-the-community-reviving-classic-guitar-hero-gameplay-in-their-own-clone|archive-date=2020-04-03|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.avclub.com/guitar-heroes-never-die-they-just-start-playing-clone-1828254899|title=Guitar Heroes never die, they just start playing Clone Hero|last=Neilan|first=Dan|date=August 10, 2018|website=AV Club|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200403231952/https://news.avclub.com/guitar-heroes-never-die-they-just-start-playing-clone-1828254899|archive-date=2020-04-03|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> However, unlike games in the ''Guitar Hero'' series, these songs do not need to be original compositions, and can instead be any audio file a member of the community wishes to turn into a playable chart.

They specialize in rapid-fire punk interpretations of a wide range of songs, often with a humorous edge.\n\nThe band is named after a children's book of the same name by Gerald G. Jampolsky and Diane V. Cirincione.\n\n==History==\nThe band's first release came with 1995's ''Denver'', a 7\" single released on band member Fat Mike's record label [[Fat Wreck Chords]], featuring two [[John Denver]] covers. The band released four more singles in 1996 and 1997, each on a different label and named after the artist covered on that particular release, as well as some compilation appearances. Their first full-length album, ''[[Have a Ball]]'', was released July 29, 1997.\n\nEach album by the band has a different theme: ''Have a Ball'' focuses on classic 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s songs by singer/songwriters like Elton John, Neil Diamond, and John Denver; ''[[Are a Drag]]'' consists entirely of [[show tunes]]; ''[[Blow in the Wind]]'' of 60s classics; ''[[Take a Break (album)|Take a Break]]'' of [[contemporary R&B]] songs (by artists such as [[Boyz 2 Men]], [[Lionel Richie]], and [[Vanessa L. Williams]]). Their fifth album ''[[Ruin Jonny's Bar Mitzvah]]'' (recorded live at a [[bar mitzvah]]) consists of pop music from the 1960s through the 1980s by artists such as [[REO Speedwagon]], [[Styx (band)|Styx]] and [[The Beatles]], as well as traditional songs like \"[[Hava Nagila]]\". The [[compilation album]] ''[[Have Another Ball!]]'' features 60's-80's classics.\n\nThe band entered the studio on April 3, 2006 to work on their sixth album, ''[[Love Their Country]]'', which was released on October 17, 2006.<ref name=\"MCLZ\">{{cite web |author1=MCLZ |title=Me First and the Gimme Gimmes, Bad Astronaut record titles and release dates |url=https://www.punknews.org/article/18612/me-first-and-the-gimme-gimmes-bad-astronaut-record-titles-and-release-dates |website=Punk News |accessdate=October 25, 2011 |language=en}}</ref> The theme of this album is [[country music|country and western]], and includes covers of tracks by [[Dixie Chicks]], [[Garth Brooks]], [[Hank Williams, Sr.]] and [[Johnny Cash]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fatwreck.com/news?page=3 |title=News: Fat Wreck Chords |publisher=Fatwreck.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821201830/http://www.fatwreck.com/news?page=3 |archive-date=2006-08-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Prior to the release of the album, Fat Wreck Chords released a digital label sampler, ''iFloyd'' which included \"[[Riders in the Sky: A Cowboy Legend|(Ghost) Riders in the Sky]]\" by the band.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fatwreck.com/ifloyd/ |title=Fat Wreck Chords Sampler 2006 |access-date=2013-06-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730051128/http://www.fatwreck.com/ifloyd/ |archive-date=2012-07-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn late 2006, [[Fat Wreck Chords]] released another digital label sampler Christmas Bonus, containing a previously-unreleased cover of [[Steve Goodman]]'s \"[[City of New Orleans (song)|City of New Orleans]]\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fatwreck.com/xmasbonus/ |title=Fat Wreck Chords :: Christmas Bonus |access-date=2013-06-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628134705/http://www.fatwreck.com/xmasbonus/ |archive-date=2007-06-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In August 2006 Me First and the Gimme Gimmes were scheduled to play three dates at [[PNC Park]] after [[Pittsburgh Pirates|Pirates]] games, but after they got booed on the first night, the next two nights were cancelled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/2006/08/26/Band-strikes-out-with-Pirates-fans/stories/200608260163 |title=Band strikes out with Pirates fans |publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date= |accessdate=2015-04-21}}</ref> They were to play along with fireworks during the post-game \"Skyblast\" shows.\n\nOn December 5, 2007, Fat Wreck Chords released a flash MP3 holiday bonus sampler called ''Hanuk-Comp'' containing \"The Boxer\", originally released on the 1997 ''Garf'' single.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://s3.fatwreck.com/dreidel/player.html |title=Fat Wreck Chords :: From The Dreidel To The Grave |publisher=S3.fatwreck.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-25}}</ref> There is also a downloadable podcast that features commentary from Fat Mike and Floyd during breaks between songs in which the next album is revealed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fatwreck.com/community |title=Community: Fat Wreck Chords |publisher=Fatwreck.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-25}}</ref> The compilation ''Have Another Ball!'' was released on July 8, 2008; it comprises all the B-side recordings from the ''Have a Ball'' singles, plus covers of \"Sodomy\" (from ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'') and Diana Ross's \"[[Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)]]\".\n\nFat Wreck Chords released ''[[Go Down Under]]'' on February 1, 2011, featuring covers of 5 songs by Australian artists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fatwreck.com/record/detail/765 |title=Me First and the Gimme Gimmes :: Go Down Under \u2013 Records: Fat Wreck Chords |publisher=Fatwreck.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-25}}</ref> On September 13, 2011 (in anticipation of a tour of Japan) Fat Wreck Chords released a 5-song EP, ''[[Sing in Japanese]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2011/09/01/music/me-first-and-the-gimme-gimmes-cover-japan-tunes |title=Me First and the Gimme Gimmes cover Japan tunes |publisher=The Japan Times |date=2011-09-01 |accessdate=2015-04-21}}</ref>\n\nIn a Reddit AMA on January 28, 2014, Fat Mike revealed the next album theme would be \"Divas\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1weo7p/this_is_fat_mike_from_nofx_i_got_tricked_into/cf1a3ml |title=Fat Mike AMA |date= |accessdate=2013-01-28}}</ref> Featuring covers of [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Christina Aguilera]] and [[Lady Gaga]], ''[[Are We Not Men?

They specialize in rapid-fire punk interpretations of a wide range of songs, often with a humorous edge.\n\nThe band is named after a children's book of the same name by Gerald G. Jampolsky and Diane V. Cirincione.\n\n==History==\nThe band's first release came with 1995's ''Denver'', a 7\" single released on band member Fat Mike's record label [[Fat Wreck Chords]], featuring two [[John Denver]] covers. The band released four more singles in 1996 and 1997, each on a different label and named after the artist covered on that particular release, as well as some compilation appearances. Their first full-length album, ''[[Have a Ball]]'', was released July 29, 1997.\n\nEach album by the band has a different theme: ''Have a Ball'' focuses on classic 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s songs by singer/songwriters like Elton John, Neil Diamond, and John Denver; ''[[Are a Drag]]'' consists entirely of [[show tunes]]; ''[[Blow in the Wind]]'' of 60s classics; ''[[Take a Break (album)|Take a Break]]'' of [[contemporary R&B]] songs (by artists such as [[Boyz 2 Men]], [[Lionel Richie]], and [[Vanessa L. Williams]]). Their fifth album ''[[Ruin Jonny's Bar Mitzvah]]'' (recorded live at a [[bar mitzvah]]) consists of pop music from the 1960s through the 1980s by artists such as [[REO Speedwagon]], [[Styx (band)|Styx]] and [[The Beatles]], as well as traditional songs like \"[[Hava Nagila]]\". The [[compilation album]] ''[[Have Another Ball!]]'' features 60's-80's classics.\n\nThe band entered the studio on April 3, 2006 to work on their sixth album, ''[[Love Their Country]]'', which was released on October 17, 2006.<ref name=\"MCLZ\">{{cite web |author1=MCLZ |title=Me First and the Gimme Gimmes, Bad Astronaut record titles and release dates |url=https://www.punknews.org/article/18612/me-first-and-the-gimme-gimmes-bad-astronaut-record-titles-and-release-dates |website=Punk News |accessdate=October 25, 2011 |language=en}}</ref> The theme of this album is [[country music|country and western]], and includes covers of tracks by [[Dixie Chicks]], [[Garth Brooks]], [[Hank Williams, Sr.]] and [[Johnny Cash]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fatwreck.com/news?page=3 |title=News: Fat Wreck Chords |publisher=Fatwreck.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821201830/http://www.fatwreck.com/news?page=3 |archive-date=2006-08-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Prior to the release of the album, Fat Wreck Chords released a digital label sampler, ''iFloyd'' which included \"[[Riders in the Sky: A Cowboy Legend|(Ghost) Riders in the Sky]]\" by the band.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fatwreck.com/ifloyd/ |title=Fat Wreck Chords Sampler 2006 |access-date=2013-06-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730051128/http://www.fatwreck.com/ifloyd/ |archive-date=2012-07-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn late 2006, [[Fat Wreck Chords]] released another digital label sampler Christmas Bonus, containing a previously-unreleased cover of [[Steve Goodman]]'s \"[[City of New Orleans (song)|City of New Orleans]]\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fatwreck.com/xmasbonus/ |title=Fat Wreck Chords :: Christmas Bonus |access-date=2013-06-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628134705/http://www.fatwreck.com/xmasbonus/ |archive-date=2007-06-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In August 2006 Me First and the Gimme Gimmes were scheduled to play three dates at [[PNC Park]] after [[Pittsburgh Pirates|Pirates]] games, but after they got booed on the first night, the next two nights were cancelled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/2006/08/26/Band-strikes-out-with-Pirates-fans/stories/200608260163 |title=Band strikes out with Pirates fans |publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date= |accessdate=2015-04-21}}</ref> They were to play along with fireworks during the post-game \"Skyblast\" shows.\n\nOn December 5, 2007, Fat Wreck Chords released a flash MP3 holiday bonus sampler called ''Hanuk-Comp'' containing \"The Boxer\", originally released on the 1997 ''Garf'' single.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://s3.fatwreck.com/dreidel/player.html |title=Fat Wreck Chords :: From The Dreidel To The Grave |publisher=S3.fatwreck.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-25}}</ref> There is also a downloadable podcast that features commentary from Fat Mike and Floyd during breaks between songs in which the next album is revealed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fatwreck.com/community |title=Community: Fat Wreck Chords |publisher=Fatwreck.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-25}}</ref> The compilation ''Have Another Ball!'' was released on July 8, 2008; it comprises all the B-side recordings from the ''Have a Ball'' singles, plus covers of \"Sodomy\" (from ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'') and Diana Ross's \"[[Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)]]\".\n\nFat Wreck Chords released ''[[Go Down Under]]'' on February 1, 2011, featuring covers of 5 songs by Australian artists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fatwreck.com/record/detail/765 |title=Me First and the Gimme Gimmes :: Go Down Under \u2013 Records: Fat Wreck Chords |publisher=Fatwreck.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-25}}</ref> On September 13, 2011 (in anticipation of a tour of Japan) Fat Wreck Chords released a 5-song EP, ''[[Sing in Japanese]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2011/09/01/music/me-first-and-the-gimme-gimmes-cover-japan-tunes |title=Me First and the Gimme Gimmes cover Japan tunes |publisher=The Japan Times |date=2011-09-01 |accessdate=2015-04-21}}</ref>\n\nIn a Reddit AMA on January 28, 2014, Fat Mike revealed the next album theme would be \"Divas\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1weo7p/this_is_fat_mike_from_nofx_i_got_tricked_into/cf1a3ml |title=Fat Mike AMA |date= |accessdate=2013-01-28}}</ref> Featuring covers of [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Christina Aguilera]] and [[Lady Gaga]], ''[[Are We Not Men?

The event, organized by the [[Entertainment Software Association]] (ESA), was to take place in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], from June 9<!-- the official E3 starts here, the press conferences do not count-->\u201311, 2020, at the [[Los Angeles Convention Center]]. However, due to concerns over the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]], the ESA announced it would not hold the physical event though would be looking at ways to hold virtual elements for the event during the same week.\n\n==Format and changes==\nIn the days prior to the event, major hardware and software vendors were to host press conferences at nearby venues, where they would introduce new hardware and games that would be on display at the exhibitor's hall during the actual event. Within the event period, attendees would have been able to view these products at the exhibitor's hall, often including playable game demos, attended special presentations offered by companies, and in some cases, had private meetings with companies on their products.

He is best known for the voice of Briar, from the hit Chinese animated television series ''[[Boonie Bears]]'', and the animated films ''[[Boonie Bears: To the Rescue]]'' (2014) and ''[[Boonie Bears: Mystical Winter]]'' (2015). He has also voiced the character \"Sarge\" in Reboant: Endless Dawn (2018), and Genesis (2019), available on ''[[PS4]]'' and ''[[Steam (software)]]''.'''\n\n==Early life==\nGrowing up in the [[Bay Area]] of California, he began singing and writing stories from the time he was in grade school. \n\nBy the time he reached junior high, his family moved to [[Concord, California]]. He later attended [[Concord High School (California)|Concord High School]]. After he graduated from high school in 2000, he continued performing with his band, Umbra. The band unfortunately disbanded in 2006, when, lead guitarist, David Tracey's father committed suicide in their [[Antioch, California]], home on July 22, 2004. Rick moved to [[Maui]] in September.\n\nAfter returning to California in 2005, Rick attended college in [[Chico, California|Chico]] to further pursue his interest in [[psychology]]. However, his passion for creative arts led him to be more involved in theater, radio, commercial and video game voice work, and independent films. He returned to Concord in 2009, where he worked retail and business-to-business marketing jobs to earn a living over the next year, before moving to [[Shenzhen]], China, to continue his acting career.\n\n==Career==\nRick began his career as an actor, studying theater at Butte College and Chico State in 2005. After several years of acting on stage, he began a short-lived career as a stand-up comic. He focused on writing and stand-up until his first full-length Indie film role as Bodhi Hemingway in \"Telling Lies\", which unfortunately never finished post-production. He continued with theater and working with the Chico Blue Room Theater's Youth Production Company. In 2010, he finally found himself working with Fantawild Animation International Studios in Shenzhen, China, voicing characters for their animated series \"Chicken Stew\" and \"Kung Fu Masters of the Zodiac: 12 Zodiac Way\".\n\nIn 2011, the company released the animated hit series \"[[Boonie Bears]]\" for which Rick voiced the famously sincere and responsible older brother bear, Briar. The series picked up momentum, as \"Boonie Bears or Bust\" (the second season to the franchise) was released and brought more loveable characters voiced by Rick, including Babu (the spastic monkey minion of King Tiki), HooHoo (the ditsy, clueless but cheerful owl), Fabian (the cunningly diabolical pet of the notorious Logger Vick), and Shaolin (the wise acrobatic tiger of the local circus troupe). As the franchise began to gain international recognition, multiple series followed.\n\nIn 2013, the company began production on \"One and a Half Heroes\" (also titled \"Tornadoclaw). The story about a great ancient warrior, Tornadoclaw (Rick Jay Glen), a master warrior cat whose reputation had been tarnished, and was exiled from the kingdom. Although the series received great reviews from the pilot episode, the production was scratched after the first episode.\n\nRick continued to work with the writing staff, music department, and marketing team of Fantawild Animation on two full-length made for tv animated movies \"Boonie Bears: Homeward Journey\" and \"Boonie Bears: Robo Rumble. After the success of \"Boonie Bears: Homeward Journey\", the company began production on the great international Box Office success \"Boonie Bears to the Rescue\", in which Rick helped doctor the final English script and provided vocals for two tracks on the Original Soundtrack, \"Lola's Eyes\" and \"Boonie Bears Samba\".\n\nOverall, Rick helped with the production and character voices of over 600 episodes of Fantawild's biggest shows, such as \"Pondemonium\", \"Brainy Bubbly Bug Buddies\", and \"Tales from the Salted Egg Temple\". After Production of \"Boonie Bears: A Mystical Winter\" on which Rick was also the musical director, he parted ways with Fantawild Animation in July of 2015.\n\nIn 2018 Rick voiced SARGE on the virtual reality AAA game \"Reboant: Endless Dawn\" for the [[Oculus Rift]] and [[Steam (service)]]. Rick consulted with Dark Lord games on the story and character development. However, by the game's release in 2018, half of the storyline and two of the characters were cut to save on production costs, in order to put more money towards marketing. The game had incredible art design and a solid budget but failed to meet the demands of gamers, who felt the game was too short for the cost.\n\nRick also appeared on [[PlayStation 4]]'s \"Genesis\" (a multiplayer online battle arena game) as five brutal characters. The first was the game's starter character, Apollo (God of the sun), Hades (Lord of the underworld), Jones (Mutant squid pirate), Minotaurus (the beast of darkness and bloodthirst), and Poseidon (the powerful and unforgiving God of the sea).\n\nRick Jay Glen left China in 2019, to come back to his home state of California where he settled and is continuing his career.\n\n==Cancer==\nAt the age of four months, he was diagnosed with [[rhabdomyosarcoma]], a cancer of the connective tissue. He was treated at [[Children's Hospital Oakland]], where they surgically removed the tumor. He underwent [[chemotherapy]] for the following two years. The cancer has not returned. He also attended camp Okizu as a child, a camp for childhood cancer survivors.\n\n==Music==\nRick was the front-man of progressive metal band, Umbra. The group was formed in late 1995 under the name 813 by Sean Mallet and David Tracey. Rick joined the group in late 1996, they later officially named themselves \"Umbra\" in 1997. The group dispersed in 2006 after a 9-year run. They recorded one album entitled \"Dark Corners of Memory\" in 2004.\n\n===Discography===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Band\n!

He is best known for the voice of Briar, from the hit Chinese animated television series ''[[Boonie Bears]]'', and the animated films ''[[Boonie Bears: To the Rescue]]'' (2014) and ''[[Boonie Bears: Mystical Winter]]'' (2015). He has also voiced the character \"Sarge\" in Reboant: Endless Dawn (2018), and Genesis (2019), available on ''[[PS4]]'' and ''[[Steam (software)]]''.'''\n\n==Early life==\nGrowing up in the [[Bay Area]] of California, he began singing and writing stories from the time he was in grade school. \n\nBy the time he reached junior high, his family moved to [[Concord, California]]. He later attended [[Concord High School (California)|Concord High School]]. After he graduated from high school in 2000, he continued performing with his band, Umbra. The band unfortunately disbanded in 2006, when, lead guitarist, David Tracey's father committed suicide in their [[Antioch, California]], home on July 22, 2004. Rick moved to [[Maui]] in September.\n\nAfter returning to California in 2005, Rick attended college in [[Chico, California|Chico]] to further pursue his interest in [[psychology]]. However, his passion for creative arts led him to be more involved in theater, radio, commercial and video game voice work, and independent films. He returned to Concord in 2009, where he worked retail and business-to-business marketing jobs to earn a living over the next year, before moving to [[Shenzhen]], China, to continue his acting career.\n\n==Career==\nRick began his career as an actor, studying theater at Butte College and Chico State in 2005. After several years of acting on stage, he began a short-lived career as a stand-up comic. He focused on writing and stand-up until his first full-length Indie film role as Bodhi Hemingway in \"Telling Lies\", which unfortunately never finished post-production. He continued with theater and working with the Chico Blue Room Theater's Youth Production Company. In 2010, he finally found himself working with Fantawild Animation International Studios in Shenzhen, China, voicing characters for their animated series \"Chicken Stew\" and \"Kung Fu Masters of the Zodiac: 12 Zodiac Way\".\n\nIn 2011, the company released the animated hit series \"[[Boonie Bears]]\" for which Rick voiced the famously sincere and responsible older brother bear, Briar.
