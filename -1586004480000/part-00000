Overwatch continued to protect the peace until it was disbanded years later under a cloud of suspicion, but its former members have returned to the fore in light of new threats to humanity. Blizzard wanted to create a diverse set of characters to reflect a positive outlook on this near future, incorporating non-human characters and non-standard character traits.

''Overwatch'' includes casual play modes, competitive ranked play modes, and various arcade modes where special rules apply. Most game modes bring together two teams of six players each into a match and compete in one of several objective-based game types based on the randomly selected map, including taking control points and escorting a payload.\n\nA match starts with each player selecting from one of the available hero characters. The game's characters are divided into three [[character classes|role]] classifications: damage, tank, and support.{{efn|Patch 1.25 issued in June 2018 merged former \"offense\" (Doomfist, Genji, McCree, Pharah, Reaper, Soldier: 76, Sombra, and Tracer) and \"defense\" (Bastion, Hanzo, Junkrat, Mei, Torbj\u00f6rn, and Widowmaker) into a single \"damage\" role.<ref name=\"gamespot patch1.25\">\n{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-update-makes-for-friendlier-post-matches/1100-6460040/ | title = Overwatch Update Makes For Friendlier Post-Matches | first = Steve | last = Watts | date = June 26, 2018 | accessdate = June 26, 2018 | work = [[Gamespot]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180627062239/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-update-makes-for-friendlier-post-matches/1100-6460040/ | archive-date = June 27, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>}} Offense characters do the majority of the team's aggressive damage. Defense characters are equipped to guard the objective and halt the enemy's advance. Tank characters can absorb large amounts of damage for the team, and support characters share healing abilities and similar [[status effects]] for the team or against enemies.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.shacknews.com/article/94529/overwatch-best-heroes-for-new-players |title= Overwatch: Best Heroes for New Players}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.vg247.com/2016/06/01/overwatch-guide/ |title= Overwatch guide: best heroes, abilities and strategies for Blizzard's shooter |date= June 6, 2016 }}</ref> The game will warn teams if they have an imbalance in their general role selection, and certain game modes require players to select different heroes. Players are able to switch between heroes mid-match after they are killed or if they return to their team's base.\n\nEach hero character has fundamentally different attributes such as health and movement speed, at least one basic attack, and at least one unique skill, collectively referred to as a skill kit. These skills can be used repeatedly after waiting out the skill's cooldown period. Each character also has at least one powerful ultimate ability that becomes available once its meter is charged, either slowly over time or through other actions such as killing opponents or healing teammates. Once the ultimate ability is used, the player has to wait for the meter to fill again. All characters have a close-combat, low damage melee attack that can be used at any time.\n\nWinning matches earns the player experience towards experience levels in the meta-game. The player earns a [[loot box]] on reaching a new experience level, which contain a random assortment of character skins, emotes, speech lines, and other cosmetic items for each character without specific game-changing effects. Players can also purchase loot boxes with real-world money. Blizzard has provided free post-release content for the game, such as new levels and characters.<ref name=\"Shacknews: post-launch\"/> Blizzard has also introduced limited-time seasonal events, offering new cosmetic items in loot boxes, themed levels, and gameplay modes.<ref>\n{{cite web |url= https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-s-winter-update-is-now-live-404634.phtml |title= Overwatch's winter update is now live |first= Kevin |last= McClusky |date= December 13, 2016 |accessdate= December 13, 2016 |work= [[Destructoid]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161213204748/https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-s-winter-update-is-now-live-404634.phtml |archive-date= December 13, 2016 |url-status= live |df= mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'' originally featured 12 characters at its November 2014 [[BlizzCon]] convention announcement,<ref name=\"Polygon: first 12\"/> but expanded to 21 by the next year's convention.<ref name=\"Polygon: BlizzCon 2015\"/> The game is character-driven, and reviewers noted ''Overwatch''{{'s}} emphasis on the individual differences between characters in the same role (e.g., between two snipers) as a departure from dominant class-based shooter paradigms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/overwatch-review/|title=Overwatch review|publisher=|date=May 28, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://kotaku.com/overwatch-the-kotaku-review-1779831636 |title= Overwatch: The Kotaku Review |first=Patricia|last=Hernandez}}</ref> Critics widely praised the game's accessible and detailed character design and its role in the game's overall success.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/5/27/11797672/overwatch-review|title=Overwatch review |first=Russ |last=Frushtick |date= May 27, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/overwatch-early-impressions-a-shooter-with-character/ |title= Overwatch early impressions: A shooter with character }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/05/27/overwatch-review/ |title= Wot I Think: Overwatch }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.wired.com/2016/05/overwatch-first-impressions/|title=Overwatch: A Laid-Back Shooter Without the Crappy Attitudes }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/im-more-excited-for-overwatchs-world-than-its-gameplay |title= I'm more excited for Overwatch's world than its gameplay |website= pcgamer |access-date= June 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\nSimilar to Valve's initial launch of ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.destructoid.com/keep-these-overwatch-animated-shorts-coming-350045.phtml |title=Keep these Overwatch animated shorts coming }}</ref> in the absence of a dedicated story mode, Blizzard tells the backstory of ''Overwatch''{{'s}} plot and characters through media outside the game, including animated shorts, character press events, tweets, and webcomics.<ref name=\"Polygon: lore\">{{cite web |url= http://www.polygon.com/2016/5/24/11722688/overwatch-timeline |title=The definitive Overwatch timeline |first=Jeff |last=Ramos |date=May 24, 2016|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/07/blizzcon-2015-overwatch-animated-shorts-announced |title= BlizzCon 2015: Overwatch Animated Shorts Announced |first= Seth G.|last=Macy }}</ref> The game's story centers around a [[technological singularity]] in which humanity assembles a team of its best heroes, Overwatch, to fight off a rogue [[artificial intelligence]] and its robotic army of Omnics in an incident called the \"Omnic Crisis\".

A few characters have had major overhauls, notably [[Symmetra]] (with two separate overhauls of her skill), Mercy, and Torbj\u00f6rn. Like new characters, these overhauls are tested in the PTR before released to all public regions.

While the sequel will add new player-versus-environment game modes, Blizzard wants to keep a shared online experience for multiplayer between the two games, so all heroes, maps, and player-versus-player game modes will be available in both ''Overwatch'' and ''Overwatch 2'', and allow matchmaking between players of the two games.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/overwatch-2-announced-blizzcon-2019/ | title = Overwatch 2 announced: New heroes, co-op story missions, and more | first=  Andy | last = Chalk | date = November 1, 2019 | accessdate = November 1, 2019 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref> With the introduction of Echo, the 32nd hero to ''Overwatch'', in March 2020, Kaplan stated that the team's focus was now on ''Overwatch 2'' and it was unlikely they would release any additional heroes prior to the game's release.<ref name=\"poly echo\"/>\n\n==Characters==\n===Tank heroes===\nTank characters broadly have a high number of hit points and often have some type of shielding to withstand damage, but tend to move slower and have lower damage output compared to the support roles.\n\n====D.Va====\n{{main|D.Va}}\nD.Va, real name Hana Song, is a [[South Korea]]n [[mecha]] pilot and former [[professional gaming|pro gamer]] from [[Busan]]. She pilots a combat mecha armed with twin ''Fusion Cannons'', shotgun-like weapons that require no ammunition or reload time. Her mecha is equipped with rocket ''Boosters'' for short bursts of flight, as well as a ''Defense Matrix'' that allows it to shoot enemy projectiles out of the air. She can also fire a volley of ''Micro-Missiles'' that do splash damage on impact.<ref name=\"vg247 sept2017\"/> D.Va's ultimate ability, ''Self-Destruct'', overloads and detonates her mecha, dealing massive damage to all enemies in a huge radius within line of sight. If her mech is destroyed (either by her ultimate or in combat), she ejects and continues to fight on foot, armed with a mid-range ''Light Gun'', until her mecha can be summoned again.\n\nTo protect its cities against a massive omnic that rose from the [[East China Sea]], the [[Republic of Korea Army|South Korean army]] developed automated battle mechs, deployed in a task force named MEKA (Mobile Exo-force of the Korean Army). As the omnic learned from its battles with the South Korean military, it disrupted the mechs' drone-control abilities, forcing the army to turn to human pilots. They elected to recruit professional gamers, who they believed possessed the necessary skills to pilot their mechs. Hana Song was the reigning ''[[StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty|StarCraft II]]'' world champion at the time, with a reputation for playing to win at all costs and showing no mercy to her opponents.

He wears a heavy suit of Crusader power armor, and carries a rocket-powered [[war hammer]] (''Rocket Hammer'') as his primary weapon. His main ability is a wide hard-light ''Barrier Field'' mounted on his arm that allows him to protect himself and teammates behind him from enemy fire. He may also launch a flaming projectile that ignores enemy barriers (''Fire Strike''), or use a rocket booster to ''Charge'' into the enemy lines, crushing them against walls. His ultimate ability, ''Earthshatter'', makes him slam his hammer against the ground, sending out a shockwave that incapacitates enemies in front of him.\n\nReinhardt Wilhelm is a decorated [[Bundeswehr]] veteran from [[Stuttgart]] who lives under a knightly code of chivalry. He served as lieutenant to Colonel Balderich von Adler, commander of the Crusaders, which served alongside the regular army to act as their shield. Reckless in his younger years, Reinhardt often left his comrades behind to find glory in battle. That would change during the battle of Eichenwalde, where he lost his left eye to the blade of an OR14 assault omnic: Retreating into Eichenwalde Castle, Balderich gave Reinhardt his Overwatch initiation medal and sent him to rejoin the others, admonishing him to \"be their shield\". Becoming the only Crusader to survive the battle, Reinhardt remained in Overwatch service well into his fifties, his code of ethics and his blunt honesty making him a respected member of the team, until he was forced to retire due to his age and left to watch as Overwatch collapsed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/reinhardt/|title=Reinhardt - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref> When Winston issued the call to arms to his Overwatch comrades, Reinhardt - living in the ruins of Eichenwalde - answered without hesitation, despite the belief of his friend Brigitte that Overwatch had tossed him aside due to his age.<ref name=\"HonorAndGlory\">\n{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2017/11/3/16604522/overwatch-reinhardt-crusaders-cinematic-honor-glory | title = The newest Overwatch cinematic, Honor and Glory, is all about Reinhardt | first = Cas | last = Marshall | date = November 3, 2017 | accessdate = November 6, 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Heroes Never Die]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171107055832/https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2017/11/3/16604522/overwatch-reinhardt-crusaders-cinematic-honor-glory | archive-date = November 7, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nReinhardt had started as one of the characters in the cancelled ''Titan'' game, as the \"Juggernaut\" character.

His main weapons are ''Hyperspheres'', gravitic projectiles that can bounce off walls and damage a small area that draw foes into the explosion, and ''Accretion'', which gathers debris into a large projectile to kinetically throw at opponents, causing knockback. He also has two defensive abilities: ''Experimental Barrier'', a shield that he can extend out in front of him to a variable distance and then recall it, upon which it starts regenerating any damage taken; and ''Kinetic Grasp'', which creates a field that absorbs projectiles that hit it which, upon release, coverts that into temporary shields for the character. His ultimate, ''Gravitic Flux'', allows him to fly up briefly to place a black hole on the ground. Any opponents trapped within the range of the hole are thrown up into the air for several seconds before being slammed to the ground, taking half of their maximum health on impact.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/22/20704154/sigma-overwatch-hero-31-trailer-animated-origin | title = Meet Sigma, Overwatch's new gravity-warping hero | first= Cass |last = Marshall | date = July 22, 2019 | accessdate  =July 22, 2019 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref><ref name=\"gspot sigma\">{{Cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatchs-new-hero-sigma-abilities-and-ultimate-d/1100-6468619/ | title = Overwatch's New Hero, Sigma, Abilities And Ultimate Detailed; Live Today On PTR | first= Steve | last =Watts | date = July 23, 2019 | accessdate = July 23, 2019 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}</ref>\n\nde Kuiper was a pioneering figure in his field and conducted most of his research at his laboratory in [[The Hague]].

He can also deploy a ''Barrier Projector'' that provides a temporary spherical shield to protect himself and teammates from enemy fire. Winston's ultimate ability is ''Primal Rage'', in which he briefly gives in to \"the beast within\" to get massively increased health and powerful melee attacks with knockback, although he foregoes his primary weapon.\n\nWinston was among a group of genetically enhanced gorillas living at the Horizon Lunar Colony, a research base on the Moon, intended to test the effects of prolonged habitation in space. He took his name from his mentor and caretaker, Dr. Harold Winston, the colony's chief scientist, from whom he also gained his signature glasses. When the other gorillas rose up, killed the human scientists, and took over the colony, Winston escaped to Earth in a rocket he built himself. He later joined up with Overwatch, offering his scientific expertise to the team (such as building Tracer's chronal accelerator).

He can engage a temporary ''Adaptive Shield'' that increase in strength with the more enemies that are nearby. He can use a ''Grappling Claw'' to attach to a surface, switching the mech to its Roll form, and which he can then swing around, gaining momentum and damage enemies in his path, and release at any time. He can execute a ''Piledriver'' that slams his mech into the ground, damaging and launching nearby enemies into the air. Hammond's ultimate is ''Minefield,'' which deploys a number of proximity mines around him that damage opponents.<ref name=\"gamespot hammond\">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatchs-new-hero-wrecking-ballhammond-is-live-o/1100-6460085/ | title =Overwatch's New Hero, Wrecking Ball/Hammond, Is Live On PTR; Abilities Revealed | first = Chris | last = Pereira | date = June 28, 2018 | accessdate = June 28, 2018 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}</ref>\n\nHammond, previously known as \"Specimen 8\", had been among the genetically engineered animals who resided at the Horizon facility on the Moon when the gorillas led an uprising against the human scientists.

His capsule separated from Winston's rocket and landed in the Australian Outback, where he modified the capsule into a combat mech to fight in the Scrapyard arena in Junkertown, earning him the nickname \"Wrecking Ball\".

She was regularly involved in fights at school, and also in petty crime. It was a chance meeting with a local ruffian named Jesse McCree, a string of crimes they committed together, and a desire to make her own \"family\" that led her to embrace the path of the outlaw, and she was one of the four original founders of the Deadlock Gang. Spurred by Ashe's increasingly larger heists, the Deadlock Gang's quick rise to prominence resulted in violent conflicts with the other criminal organizations in the American Southwest. After years of fighting, Ashe summoned the heads of the other major groups and used her business acumen, learned from her mostly-absent parents, to convince them that they could work better, if not together, then at least not against one another, so long as they kept their word, did not work with law enforcement, respected one another's territory, and punished any sort of betrayal. No longer having to focus on squabbles with other gangs, Ashe continued to build on her reputation, earning her a place at the top of the authorities' most wanted lists.<ref name=\"AsheInfo\"/>\n\nBlizzard considered Ashe a \"unicorn\" character in that her route from conception to implementation was straightforward, a rarity from their past experience. They wanted to create a female gunslinger, but needed to differentiate her from either McCree or Reaper, and some initial designs felt too goth-like. They settled on a mix of a biker and a cowboy. A similar streamlined experience was found with B.O.B., having been already drawn into the storyboard for the animated short \"Reunion\" and became an internal favorite to bring into the game, and only required translating his design into the game. One difficulty faced by the team was how to implement and optimize B.O.B., since he is treated as another teammate while on the field, impacting the game's memory and performance.<ref name=\"ashe makingof\">\n{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/11/2/18057328/overwatch-hero-29-ashe-bob-concept-art-blizzcon-2018 | title = The making of Overwatch's next hero, Ashe (and BOB) | first = Michael | last = McWhertor | date = November 2, 2018 | accessdate = November 2, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Heroes Never Die]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181103052306/https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/11/2/18057328/overwatch-hero-29-ashe-bob-concept-art-blizzcon-2018 | archive-date = November 3, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nAshe was introduced as the 29th hero in the animated short ''Reunion'', shown at [[BlizzCon#2018|BlizzCon]] on November 2, 2018, and was available to play on the PTR on November 5.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/overwatchs-new-hero-ashe-is-now-playable-on-the-ptr/ | title = Overwatch's new hero Ashe is now playable on the PTR | first = Bo | last = Moore | date = November 5, 2018 | accessdate = November 5, 2018 | work = [[PC Gamer]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181106005129/https://www.pcgamer.com/overwatchs-new-hero-ashe-is-now-playable-on-the-ptr/ | archive-date = November 6, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> She was added to the main game for all players on November 13, 2018,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.destructoid.com/today-s-overwatch-patch-brings-out-ashe-and-more-balance-changes-531105.phtml | title = Today's Overwatch patch brings out Ashe and more balance changes| first =Jordan | last = Devore | date = November 13, 2018 | accessdate = November 13, 2018 | work = [[Destructoid]] }}</ref> and to competitive play on November 27, 2018.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/11/27/18114806/ashe-competitive-play-unlock-available | title = Ashe and Bob join Overwatch competitive play | first = Cass | last = Marshall | date = November 27, 2018 | accessdate = November 27, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Heroes Never Die]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181127234356/https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/11/27/18114806/ashe-competitive-play-unlock-available | archive-date = November 27, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> She is voiced by veteran voice actress [[Jennifer Hale]].<ref name=\"ashe makingof\"/>\n\n====Bastion====\nBastion is a combat robot-turned-explorer. It can ''Reconfigure'' between a mobile form outfitted with a submachine gun (''Configuration: Recon'') and a stationary form equipped with a [[Gatling gun]] (''Configuration: Sentry''). It also has the ability to ''Self-Repair'' and quickly regain lost health, and its ''Ironclad'' passive reduces damage taken. Its ultimate ability is ''Configuration: Tank'', which allows it to roll on treads and fire explosive rounds from a smooth-bore cannon for a short period of time.\n\nBastion is a SST Laboratories Siege Automaton E54, a battle automaton originally designed for peacekeeping purposes; during the Omnic Crisis, they were deployed against their human makers becoming a symbol of the horrors of the war. Bastion was severely damaged in the field near the German village of Eichenwalde in the [[Black Forest]] during the final days of the war, and was left dormant and exposed to the elements. For more than a decade, it became overgrown with plant life and the nests of small animals, until it unexpectedly reactivated. It had developed a fascination with nature, but its combat programming still took over whenever it encountered anything it perceived as a threat. Due to conflicts with fearful humans, Bastion largely avoids populated areas in favor of exploring the wild.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/bastion/|title=Bastion - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref> It is usually accompanied by a small bird named Ganymede, who was building a nest on it when it reactivated, and both humanizes Bastion and makes it relatable.\n\nBastion is the focus of the animated short ''The Last Bastion'', showing the moments when Ganymede inadvertently reactivated it.<ref>\n{{Citation|last=PlayOverwatch|title=Overwatch Animated Short {{!}} \"The Last Bastion\"|date=2016-08-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to8yh83jlXg|accessdate=2017-08-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827005735/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to8yh83jlXg|archive-date=August 27, 2017|url-status=live}}\n</ref> Bastion was also the first character to be made available in [[Lego]] form through official collaboration between Blizzard and [[The Lego Group]].<ref>\n{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/10/lego-overwatch-first-set-revealed-available-now | title = Lego Overwatch First Set Revealed, Available Now | first = Nick | last = Santangelo | date = October 10, 2018 | accessdate = October 10, 2018 | work = [[IGN]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181011013718/http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/10/lego-overwatch-first-set-revealed-available-now | archive-date = October 11, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> A limited-time event in 2019 allowed players the opportunity to earn a Bastion skin based on the Lego version.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/new-overwatch-event-lets-players-earn-a-lego-themed-bastion-skin/ | title = New Overwatch event lets players earn a Lego-themed Bastion skin | first = Bo | last= Moore | date = September 17, 2019 | accessdate = September 17, 2019 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref>\n\nBastion is voiced by [[Chris Metzen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/50swfk/ama_request_the_overwatch_sound_design_team/?sort=old|title=AMA Request - The Overwatch Sound design team \u2022 r/Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Doomfist====\n{{Main|Doomfist}}\nDoomfist is both the name of the titular cybernetic [[gauntlet (glove)|gauntlet]] and the title of its wielder, currently the [[Nigerian]]-born Akande Ogundimu, businessman and mixed martial artist turned mercenary. He has a short-range ''Hand Cannon'' on his off-hand that fires shotgun-like bursts and regenerates ammo over time, but most of his abilities come through melee attacks from the Doomfist Gauntlet. Doomfist can charge up a ''Rocket Punch'' that lets him lunge forward and punch an opponent backwards, a ''Seismic Slam'' that launches enemies in its range a short distance towards Doomfist, and a ''Rising Uppercut'' that greatly launches a single enemy while doing damage. Each ability that successfully hits also generates personal shielding for Doomfist (''The Best Defense...'').

His main attack method is to throw three ''[[Shurikens]]'', either in quick succession or simultaneously in a horizontal spread. His abilities are ''Swift Strike'', a quick dashing lunge with good range, and ''Deflect'', a defensive stance that briefly ricochets projectiles back at enemies with his [[wakizashi]]. His ''Cyber-Agility'' allows him to double-jump and run up walls. Genji's ultimate ability is ''Dragonblade'', during which Genji unsheathes the [[odachi]] on his back and delivers powerful, sweeping melee attacks.\n\nIn his origin story, Genji transforms from a slacker to a superhero.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://killscreen.com/articles/genji-is-with-you/|title=Genji is with you - Kill Screen|date=August 12, 2016|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/94804/overwatch-how-to-use-genji-effectively|title=Overwatch: How to Use Genji Effectively|publisher=|access-date=November 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818045314/http://www.shacknews.com/article/94804/overwatch-how-to-use-genji-effectively|archive-date=August 18, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> His family\u2014the Japanese Shimada crime family\u2014ordered his eldest brother Hanzo to kill Genji for his selfish and hedonistic behavior (as shown in the short ''Dragons''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/overwatchs-new-animated-short-explores-hanzo-and-genjis-1776890949|title=Overwatch's New Animated Short Explores Hanzo And Genji's Tragic Rivalry|last=Grayson|first=Nathan|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatchs-hanzo-and-genji-square-off-in-blizzards/1100-6439845/|title=Overwatch's Hanzo and Genji Square Off in Blizzard's Latest Short Film|publisher=}}</ref> and referenced in-game Hanamura map by a shrine devoted to Genji<ref name=\"PC Gamer: hidden lore\" />).

Since the cooldown for his ''Swift Strike'' resets upon scoring a kill, it is best used as a finishing move. Genji's ''Deflect'' ability can counter many enemy ultimate abilities, like Soldier: 76's ''Tactical Visor'' or McCree's ''Deadeye''. While some characters function best when paired with specific teammates, Genji works best in isolation.<ref name=\"Polygon: Guide\" /> Genji is strong against turrets like Bastion and those of Torbj\u00f6rn, and is effective at flanking snipers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/overwatch-how-to-play-genji|title=Overwatch - How to Play Genji|first=Mike|last=Williams|publisher=}}</ref> Genji is vulnerable against characters with energy weapons that bypass his deflection, such as Symmetra, Winston, and Zarya. As Genji is reliant on ''Deflect'', the common way to counter him is baiting him into using it then attacking when it's on cooldown.

He wields the ''Storm Bow'' and is equipped with specialized arrows, including ''Sonic Arrows'' to detect enemies and ''Storm Arrows'' to fire six full-power shots in rapid succession. He is also able to ''Wall Climb'', enabling him to reach vantage points, and ''Lunge'' forward while in mid-air. His ultimate ability is ''Dragonstrike'', in which he unleashes a spiraling spirit dragon that can travel through obstacles to deal damage in a straight line.\n\nHanzo is the elder brother of Genji, and the heir to the head of the Shimada clan. He was trained from an early age to take over the clan, becoming a skilled warrior and marksman, as well as a strategist. When his father died, Hanzo was directed by the clan elders to bring Genji into line; and when Genji refused, the two brothers battled, resulting in what appeared to be Genji's death.

Junkrat's ultimate ability is ''RIP-Tire'', a self-propelled truck wheel loaded with explosives that he's able to manually steer and detonate.

The effects of the radiation awakened a sense of madness which soon developed into [[pyromania]]. In the heart of the destroyed omnium, Junkrat found a valuable secret, making him the target of bounty hunters and rival gangs.

He can quickly dodge attacks using his ''Combat Roll'' ability which also instantly reloads his [[revolver]], and can throw a ''[[Stun grenade|Flashbang]]'' grenade a short distance which stuns enemies and interrupts their abilities.

She wields an ''Endothermic Blaster'' that can either freeze enemies in place with a short-range spray or shoot a long-range icicle projectile, and she can also use it to ''Cryo-Freeze'' herself in a solid ice block to shield herself from damage and heal injuries, as well as erect ''Ice Walls'' with many versatile uses, primarily for blocking the enemies. Her ultimate ability is ''Blizzard'', which calls down Snowball, her personal weather modification drone, to freeze all enemies in a wide radius.\n\nMei was employed by Overwatch to help discover the cause for the planet's changing climate, which had been variously blamed on industry, the increasing Omnic population, and increased consumption of natural resources. While deployed at an Overwatch research base in [[Antarctica]], Mei and the other scientists there were trapped by a polar storm that damaged the facility. Lacking sufficient resources to wait for a rescue, they decided to enter cryostasis. But the pods malfunctioned, and Mei was the only survivor when she was found close to a decade later; by that time, Overwatch had disbanded, and all of the bases set up to monitor the climate crisis had stopped functioning. Mei elected to carry on the work alone, accompanied by Snowball.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/mei/|title=Mei - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref> As she restores the base's communication system, she hears Winston's recall for Overwatch, and sets off with Snowball to make her way back to society, joining Winston and Tracer on the first mission to fight the Null Sector off in Paris.<ref name=\"ign story 2019\"/>\n\nMei is the focus of the animated short ''Rise and Shine'', showing the moments after she awakened from cryostasis and had to find a way to call for help.<ref>\n{{Citation|last=PlayOverwatch|title=Overwatch Animated Short {{!}} \"Rise and Shine\"|date=2017-08-23|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tjcm_kI0n0|accessdate=2017-08-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824133610/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tjcm_kI0n0|archive-date=August 24, 2017|url-status=live}}\n</ref>\n\nMei is voiced by [[Zhang Yu (voice actress)|Yu \"Elise\" Zhang]].<ref>\n{{Cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2017/5/1/15506768/overwatch-mei-voice-line | title = Overwatch's cutest voice line was a recording booth accident | first = Allegra | last = Frank | date = May 1, 2017 | accessdate = May 1, 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170502012601/https://www.polygon.com/2017/5/1/15506768/overwatch-mei-voice-line | archive-date = May 2, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\n====Pharah====\nPharah, real name Fareeha Amari, is an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] security officer. She wears the Raptora Mark VI, a [[Jet pack|jetpack]]-equipped combat suit, and wields a ''[[Rocket launcher|Rocket Launcher]]'' as her primary weapon. She has a Wedjat ([[Eye of Horus]]) tattoo around her right eye. Her abilities are ''Concussive Blast'', a rocket with powerful knockback but no damage, and ''Jump Jets'', a quick jetpack-assisted vertical ascension comparable to a [[rocket jump]]. Her passive ability allows her to ''Hover'' in the air, which is paired well with her Jump Jets ability. Pharah's ultimate ability is ''Barrage'', where she fires a continuous stream of small air-to-ground rockets at targets, while she is frozen still in place.\n\nFareeha Amari is the daughter of Ana Amari and Sam (the same Sam that is Charlotte's husband in The Guy Who Didn't Like Musicals Ana was one of the people Sam was cheating in Charlotte with), one of the founding members of Overwatch. She served as an officer in the [[Egyptian Army]] and aspired to follow in her mother's footsteps, but Overwatch was disbanded before she could join its ranks. After leaving the army, Pharah took a job with Helix Security International, a private security firm contracted to protect an [[artificial intelligence]] facility below the [[Giza Plateau]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/pharah/|title=Pharah - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nPharah is a solid attacker able to consistently maintain pressure on the enemy team. Her rocket launcher allows her to hold chokepoints or lay out suppressive fire onto objectives both in offense and defense, and her vertical agility renders her out of reach for characters reliant on close-range fighting. Her ''Concussion Blast'' disrupts enemy formations, and in the hands of a skilled player it can be used to score environmental kills. Pharah is a good match with Mercy, whose ''Guardian Angel'' ability allows both of them to fly alongside each other; this tactic is often called \"Pharmercy\". Pharah is vulnerable against long-range oriented characters, especially those wielding [[hitscan]] weapons, such as Widowmaker or McCree.\n\nPharah is voiced by Jamie Lyn Beatty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twinfinite.net/gallery/here-are-the-voice-actors-of-the-overwatch-cast/3|title=Here Are the Voice Actors of the Overwatch Cast|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Reaper====\nReaper, real name Gabriel Reyes, is an American mercenary and terrorist, originally a founding member of Overwatch, now a leading member of Talon. He is attired in a black hooded trenchcoat with a white skull mask and wields twin ''Hellfire Shotguns''. His abilities are ''Shadow Step'', a medium-range line of sight teleport, and ''Wraith Form'', a brief period of invincibility and speed increase. He was able to heal himself by consuming the souls of fallen enemies, visible as red burning \"Soul Globes\" on the ground but later was changed to a passive ability called ''The Reaping'' which allows him to steal a 20% heal from the damage he deals. Reaper's ultimate ability is ''Death Blossom'', a twin shotgun [[gun kata]] which deals massive damage in a short radius around him.\n\nBorn in [[Los Angeles]], Gabriel Reyes was a veteran officer of the [[United States Armed Forces]] who was subjected to a \"soldier enhancement program\", where he and the other selectees were genetically enhanced to become \"perfect soldiers\"; Reyes became known as \"Soldier: 24\". When the United Nations formed Overwatch to combat the Omnic Crisis, Reyes was one of the two men from the program on the shortlist to join up and was initially tapped to lead it. However, he was passed over in favor of his friend Jack Morrison, causing a rift between the two men. Reyes was later named commander of Blackwatch, Overwatch's black ops division, but his jealousy of Morrison (due to Morrison's publicity as the official leader of Overwatch, versus Reyes' secret dealings with Blackwatch) eventually caused Reyes to reveal Blackwatch's existence to the public, destroying both organizations and resulting in a battle that destroyed their headquarters in [[Switzerland]]. Both men were believed dead, but in reality survived, although Reyes's cells are now simultaneously decaying and regenerating, causing his body to fall apart and rebuild itself over and over again.<ref name=\"FadingGlory\">{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/blog/19809396|title=Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nReyes resurfaced years later as \"the Reaper\", a mysterious mercenary responsible for terrorist attacks all around the world, having been consumed by his hunger for fame to the point that he no longer cared what he was known for. Through the efforts of rogue geneticist and former Blackwatch member [[#Moira|Moira O'Deorain]], he has developed the ability to steal life essence from his enemies, and also become incorporeal to avoid harm.<ref name=\"polygon moira story\"/> His true identity is unknown to the rest of the world, as are his motivations, though a pattern of his movements indicates that he is hunting down former agents of Overwatch.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/reaper/|title=Reaper - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref> He appears in the cinematic trailer, teamed with Widowmaker in a raid in the Overwatch Museum to steal Doomfist's gauntlet for Talon.<ref name=\"IntroCinematic\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqnKB22pOC0|title=Overwatch Cinematic Trailer|last=PlayOverwatch|date=November 7, 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> He also appears in the animated short ''Recall'', where he raids Winston's lab at [[Gibraltar]] to steal his list of Overwatch agents, though he was unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Recall\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sB5zlHMsM7k|title=Overwatch Animated Short - \"Recall\"|last=PlayOverwatch|date=March 23, 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nReaper is a flanker/assassin type of character, able to teleport behind enemy lines and attack from the rear to single out targets of importance, before using ''Wraith Form'' to escape. The ability to heal from dealing damage helps him in taking out tanks, due to their large bodies and health pools making it easier for him to heal rapidly. Reaper is vulnerable while executing his ''Death Blossom'', so proper usage of it relies heavily on the element on surprise, taking enemies out with its massive damage output before they get the chance to react.\n\nReaper is voiced by [[Keith Ferguson (voice actor)|Keith Ferguson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twinfinite.net/gallery/here-are-the-voice-actors-of-the-overwatch-cast/6|title=Here Are the Voice Actors of the Overwatch Cast|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Soldier: 76====\nSoldier: 76, real name Jack Francis Morrison, is an American soldier-turned-vigilante and a founding member of Overwatch. He wears a facemask with a visor and carries an experimental ''Heavy Pulse Rifle'' equipped with an underbarrel launcher that fires three ''Helix Rockets''. His abilities are ''Sprint'', a forward run with no duration limit or cooldown, and ''Biotic Field'', a deployable device which regenerates the health of allies in the immediate vicinity. His ultimate ability, ''Tactical Visor'', puts up a [[head-up display]] that allows his rifle to automatically track enemies in his line of sight for a brief period, similar to an [[aimbot]].\n\nJack Morrison was born in rural [[Indiana]], and enlisted in the United States military when he was eighteen. His bravery and work ethic earned him the attention of the \"soldier enhancement program\", and he later joined Overwatch alongside his friend Gabriel Reyes. His contributions to its success in ending the Omnic Crisis led to his being granted command of the task force, leading to a rift between him and Reyes. As Overwatch came under worldwide scrutiny due to allegations of corruption, the tensions between the two men came to outright conflict, resulting in the destruction of Overwatch headquarters. Morrison was believed to have been killed in the explosion, and was reportedly buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].<ref name=\"FadingGlory\"/>\n\nFive years later, however, Morrison resurfaced as the vigilante \"Soldier: 76\", becoming the focus of an international manhunt following a series of attacks against former Overwatch facilities, stealing weapons and advanced technologies. He wages a personal war to discover the truth behind the events that led to the fall of Overwatch.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/soldier-76/|title=Soldier: 76 - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref> In the \"Bastet\" short story released by Blizzard in January 2019, it is revealed that Soldier: 76 at one point had a gay relationship with a man named Vincent prior to fully investing his time into Overwatch, making him the second confirmed LGBT character of the ''Overwatch'' roster after Tracer.<ref name=\"vg247 s76 gay\">\n{{cite web | url = https://www.vg247.com/2019/01/07/overwatchs-soldier-76-confirmed-as-gay/ | title = Overwatch short story confirms that Soldier: 76 is gay | first = Shabana | last = Arif | date = January 7, 2019 | accessdate = January 7, 2019 | work = [[VG247]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190108032925/https://www.vg247.com/2019/01/07/overwatchs-soldier-76-confirmed-as-gay/ | archive-date = January 8, 2019 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nSoldier: 76 was actually developed by ''Overwatch''{{'}}s creative director [[Chris Metzen]] in the early 2000s as part of non-gaming related projects within Blizzard, and which he later adapted for a comic story used in ''[[Digital Webbing]] Presents'' #16, published in July 2004. Metzen described Soldier: 76's background here as one of a line of American \"super soldiers\" that had been implanted with microchips to give them superhuman abilities. Soldier: 76 was thought killed in an assassination attempt but instead found himself abandoned in South America with no memories of his past, only returning to the United States after a second civil war breaks out, to help try to restore order and discover his past. While ''Overwatch'' modified Metzen's original design, the game's version of Soldier: 76 still maintains the same color scheme and jacket that was used in the comic book story.<ref>\n{{Cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/one-overwatch-character-has-been-around-for-more-than-a-1773669625 | title = One Overwatch Character Has Been Around For More Than A Decade | first = Nathan | last = Grayson | date = April 28, 2016 | accessdate = May 24, 2017 | work = [[Kotaku]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170528141357/http://kotaku.com/one-overwatch-character-has-been-around-for-more-than-a-1773669625 | archive-date = May 28, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref><ref>\n{{Cite web | url = http://www.cbr.com/warcraft-diablo-creator-joins-digital-webbing-presents-16/ | title = Warcraft, Diablo Creator Joins \"Digital Webbing Presents\" #16 | date = July 7, 2004 | accessdate = May 24, 2017 | work = [[Comic Book Resources]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170825021809/http://www.cbr.com/warcraft-diablo-creator-joins-digital-webbing-presents-16/ | archive-date = August 25, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> Within ''Overwatch'' Metzen opted to use the name \"Jack Morrison\" referencing [[John Wayne]] and [[Jim Morrison]].<ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-soldier-76-middle-name | title = Soldier: 76's middle name is Francis | first = Ian | last = Bourdeau | date = September 30, 2018 | accessdate = September 30, 2018 | work = [[PCGamesN]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180930173622/https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-soldier-76-middle-name | archive-date = September 30, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nSoldier: 76 was the most popular offense character during the game's open beta.<ref name=\"Polygon: beta stats\"/> He was conceived as a \"gateway hero\" to help players that are used to modern shooters ease into the game,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://overwatch.blizzplanet.com/blog/comments/blizzcon-2014-overwatch-unveiled-panel-transcript/2|title=BlizzCon 2014 - Overwatch Unveiled Panel Transcript - Page 2 of 4 - Blizzplanet - Overwatch|date=November 24, 2014|publisher=}}</ref> but his versatility and high skill ceiling makes him a good choice for veteran players as well. He is able to perform well in almost any situation, being effective on all ranges, move quickly around the battlefield, as well as able to heal both himself and his team.

Sombra also has ''Thermoptic Camo'' that gives her invisibility paired with a speed boost, and can throw down a ''Translocator'' beacon that she can later teleport to. Her passive ability, ''Opportunist'', enables her to track enemies that are low on health, even through walls. Sombra's ultimate ability is ''[[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]]'', an electromagnetic shockwave that hacks all enemies around her, as well as disabling their barriers and shields and displaying if they have fully charged ultimates.<ref name=\"gamespot sombra announced\">\n{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatchs-next-character-sombra-officially-reveal/1100-6445128/ | title = Overwatch's Next Character, Sombra, Officially Revealed | first = Chris | last = Pereira | date = November 4, 2016 | accessdate = November 4, 2016 | work = [[GameSpot]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161107181540/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatchs-next-character-sombra-officially-reveal/1100-6445128/ | archive-date = November 7, 2016 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nIn the ''Overwatch'' narrative, Sombra had been orphaned at an early age but quickly discovered her natural gift for hacking.

She was eventually discovered by a mysterious organization that forced her into hiding, destroying all records of her existence.

His armor comes equipped with a mobile forge, and he carries a ''Rivet Gun'' that shoots molten slag and a ''Forge Hammer'' for construction and melee attacks. His ''Deploy Turret'' allows him to toss a turret a short distance away, which will then self-deploy before targeting and firing on any opponent in its sights. His ''Overload'' ability briefly increases his armor, and improves his speed and attack attributes for a short amount of time. His ultimate abilitiy ''Molten Core'' allows him to shoot up to ten globs of molten metal on the ground, damaging any opponent that crosses through them.\n\nTorbj\u00f6rn Lindholm believes that technology should serve a better vision for humanity, putting him at odds with his employers, who wanted to control the weapons with artificial intelligence. His deep-seated fear of sentient machines, dismissed at first as paranoia, became reality during the Omnic Crisis, during which he was recruited by Overwatch. His engineering knowledge proved invaluable to achieving Overwatch's aim of ending the Omnic Crisis. After Overwatch was disbanded, his weapons were stolen or stashed away, and Torbj\u00f6rn has set out to ensure they are not used to harm the innocent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/torbjorn/|title=Torbj\u00f6rn - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nWhile Torbj\u00f6rn was not the first character created for ''Overwatch'', his design, meant to bridge between ''Warcraft'' and ''Overwatch'', became the baseline for nearly all other asset design for the game.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://kotaku.com/without-torbjorn-overwatch-wouldnt-be-overwatch-1792919785 | title = Overwatch's Unique Art Style Began With Torbjorn | first = Nathan | last = Grayson | date = March 2, 2017 | accessdate = March 2, 2017 | work = [[Kotaku]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170303040136/http://kotaku.com/without-torbjorn-overwatch-wouldnt-be-overwatch-1792919785 | archive-date = March 3, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> At launch, Torbj\u00f6rn would have to place a turret and then hammer on it to bring it up to a higher level, while his ultimate ''Molten Core'' would be used to give him a burst of energy and speed as well as briefly upgrading the turret to its highest value. Torbj\u00f6rn could also collect scrap left by fallen players, when he then could use to make armor pickups for his allies. Lead game designer Geoff Goodman called Torbj\u00f6rn a \"little overly defensive focused\", and wanted to make the hero more capable on offense in non-payload map.

Her ultimate ability is ''Pulse Bomb'', an explosive charge that sticks to enemies, exploding after a brief delay for massive damage.\n\nBorn in [[London]] following the events of the Omnic Crisis, Lena Oxton became the youngest test pilot in Overwatch's experimental flight program, and was tapped to test the \"Slipstream\", a fighter jet that used teleportation technology. During the test flight, a malfunction caused the craft to vanish and Tracer along with it. She was presumed dead. However, she reappeared months later, though suffering from a condition preventing her from maintaining a physical form and which caused her to vanish for hours or even days at a time.

She also uses a ''Grappling Hook'' to reach high ledges and ''Venom Mines'' to disable enemies. Her ultimate ability is ''Infra-Sight'', which activates her recon visor to highlight all enemies through walls for her and her team, similar to a [[Cheating in online games#World-Hacking|wallhack]].\n\nAm\u00e9lie was a ballet dancer and was the wife of G\u00e9rard Lacroix, an Overwatch agent heading operations against the terrorist organization known as Talon. When their assassins were unable to get close to Lacroix, they kidnapped Am\u00e9lie and reprogrammed her as a sleeper agent. She was found and returned home by Overwatch agents, unaware of what had happened; two weeks later, she killed her husband in his sleep. Returning to Talon, she underwent extensive training in the covert arts, and her physiology was altered to slow her heart, turning her skin blue.

They may also be able to apply debuffs to the opposing team, making them more prone to attack. Support heroes tend to have the fewest hit points but also can self-regenerate their health at times.\n\n====Ana====\nAna, full name Ana Amari, is an Egyptian sniper and bounty hunter, and one of the founding members of Overwatch. She wields a ''Biotic Rifle'' loaded with smart darts that damage enemies and heal allies, as well as [[Tranquillizer gun|a sidearm that fires ''Sleep Darts'']]. She also carries ''Biotic Grenades'' that disable enemy healing and boost ally healing. Her ultimate ability is ''Nano Boost'', which grants an attack and defense boost to a teammate hero.\n\nHailing from [[Cairo]], Ana Amari was considered the best sniper in the world, and rushed in to support the unprepared Egyptian defense forces during the Omnic Crisis. Her marksmanship and her critical decision-making skills led to her being recruited by Overwatch, and she served for many years as Jack Morrison's second-in-command during the conflict, while trying to be a mother to her daughter, Fareeha. Even with her command responsibility, Ana refused to give up going on combat missions. Remaining in service well into her fifties, Ana was believed to have been killed by Widowmaker during a hostage rescue; when Ana hesitated to make the kill shot, realizing that her target had in fact been her friend Am\u00e9lie Lacroix, Widowmaker shot her through her rifle's lens, destroying her right eye, then proceeded to kill the hostages.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzFWIw7wV8Q|title=[NEW HERO] Ana Origin Story - Overwatch|last=PlayOverwatch|date=July 12, 2016|via=YouTube|access-date=July 12, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160713082817/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzFWIw7wV8Q|archive-date=July 13, 2016|url-status=live}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://comic.playoverwatch.com/en-us/legacy|title=Blizzard - Comic Book Experience|publisher=}}</ref> Though Ana survived, Overwatch soon disbanded.

When they started brainstorming new playable heroes, the idea of an [[alchemy|alchemist]] was raised, leading to the concept of a \"skill-based support healer\", according to Chu. This led to them to consider making Ana this new playable character, as these support sniper skills would contrast well against those of the already-established character of Widowmaker.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-lead-writer-discusses-diversity-and-new-/1100-6446434/ | title = Overwatch Lead Writer Discusses Diversity and New Webcomic | first = Jason | last = Imms | date = December 20, 2016 | accessdate = December 21, 2016 | work = [[GameSpot]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161224175838/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-lead-writer-discusses-diversity-and-new-/1100-6446434/ | archive-date = December 24, 2016 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> Ana was the first character to be added to ''Overwatch'' following its launch; she was announced and available to play on the Public Test regions on July 12, 2016,<ref>\n{{Cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-07-12-our-first-look-at-overwatchs-new-hero-ana | title = Our first look at Overwatch's new hero, Ana | first = Chris | last = Bratt | date = July 12, 2016 | accessdate = July 12, 2016 | work = [[Eurogamer]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160713160749/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-07-12-our-first-look-at-overwatchs-new-hero-ana | archive-date = July 13, 2016 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> and was playable by all PC and console players on July 19, 2016.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/overwatch-s-new-hero-ana-is-now-live-for-all-to-play-1783928089 | title = Overwatch's new hero, Ana, is now live for all to play | first = Nathan | last = Grayson | date = July 19, 2016 | accessdate = July 19, 2016 | work = [[Kotaku]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160721062559/http://kotaku.com/overwatch-s-new-hero-ana-is-now-live-for-all-to-play-1783928089 | archive-date = July 21, 2016 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> In January 2019, Blizzard published a short story \"Bastet\" that focused on Ana and her relationship with Soldier:76.

His active abilities includes a ''Regenerative Burst'' that heals himself and nearby allies over a short period of time, and an ''Immortality Field'' device that prevents teammates from dying while in range, but the device itself can be destroyed prematurely.  His ultimate is an ''Amplification Matrix'' that increases damage and healing effects of allies' shots that pass through it.<ref name=\"pcgamer baptiste intro\">\n{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/baptiste-abilities-overwatch/ | title = Baptiste abilities: Here's everything Overwatch's new combat medic can do | author = Bo Moore | date = February 26, 2019 | accessdate = February 26, 2019 | work = [[PC Gamer]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190227120753/https://www.pcgamer.com/baptiste-abilities-overwatch/ | archive-date = February 27, 2019 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nOriginally from [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]], Baptiste was among the thirty million children orphaned by the Omnic Crisis. He enlisted in the military of the Caribbean Coalition, an alliance of island nations united by the crisis, as a combat medic, driven by his desire to help others; he would eventually rise to become part of the Coalition's special ops division. After the end of the war, Baptiste struggled to find work until he was recruited by Talon, one of a number of mercenary groups that arose in the aftermath of the crisis. At first, he thrived within Talon, which gave him easy assignments that paid well enough for him to establish a clinic in his hometown. As time went on, however, the missions his unit was sent on became increasingly violent, including assassinations of rivals and operations that involved civilian casualties. Disgusted, Baptiste abandoned Talon and set out to wander the world, offering his aid where he could. Realizing that Baptiste knew too much about their operations, Talon regularly sent assassins, including members of his former unit, to silence him, without success; those few who were able to locate him were never seen again.<ref name=\"poly baptiste announce\">\n{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/25/18238602/overwatch-baptiste-hero-origins-animation-reveal | title = Overwatch reveals its newest hero, the support soldier Baptiste | first = Cass | last = Marshall | date = February 25, 2019 | accessdate = February 25, 2019 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190226012602/https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/25/18238602/overwatch-baptiste-hero-origins-animation-reveal | archive-date = February 26, 2019 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref><ref name=\"BaptisteInfo\">\n{{cite web | url = https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/baptiste | title = Baptiste | date = February 26, 2019 | accessdate = February 26, 2019 | work = [[Blizzard Entertainment]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190227060726/https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/baptiste | archive-date = February 27, 2019 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nAfter approximately a week of teases through their social media sites, Blizzard formally introduced Baptiste as the game's 30th hero with an origin story video on February 25, 2019,<ref name=\"poly baptiste announce\"/> and was added to the PTR the following day.<ref name=\"pcgamer baptiste intro\"/> Baptiste was made live for all servers on March 19, 2019.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/03/19/overwatch-adds-baptiste-hero-30/ | title = Overwatch patches in Baptiste to patch you up | first= Alice | last = O'Conner | date = March 19, 2019 | accessdate = March 19, 2019 | work = [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] }}</ref> In June 2019, Blizzard released \"What You Left Behind\" a short story about Baptiste's background written by [[Alissa Wong]] and illustrated by [[Arnold Tsang]].

She was named by her godfather Reinhardt Wilhelm, to whom Torbj\u00f6rn and his pregnant wife Ingrid were indebted to after Reinhardt saved his life during \"Operation White Dome\" in [[Istanbul]]. As such, Brigitte became close friends with Reinhardt, and grew up on his tales of heroes and chivalry. While Torbj\u00f6rn was more interested in creating weapons, Brigitte's aptitudes were for creating armor and defensive systems. After the fall of Overwatch, Reinhardt elected to travel the world as something of a knight-errant, and Brigitte, to his surprise, asked him if she could accompany him as his squire, to which he agreed. Her job included maintaining Reinhardt's Crusader armor, to which she was well-suited as it was based on a design created by her father, but as time went on, she was often required to take care of Reinhardt himself, who maintained an overenthusiasm for combat in spite of his increasing age and frailty. Eventually she decided that just maintaining Reinhardt's armor was not enough, and had Reinhardt train her in combat while she created her own suit of armor in secret, so that she could fight alongside him.<ref name=\"BrigitteBio\">\n{{Cite web |url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/brigitte/ |title=Brigitte - Heroes - Overwatch |access-date=February 28, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228181926/https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/brigitte |archive-date=February 28, 2018 |url-status=live  }}\n</ref> She accompanies Reinhardt to answer Winston's Overwatch recall.<ref name=\"ign story 2019\"/>\n\nShe appears in the digital comics ''Dragon Slayer'' and ''Reflections''.

Most scientists found her research dangerous due to its perceived ethical shortfalls, with some even going so far as to accuse her of having the same obsession with scientific advancement that started the Omnic Crisis. Adding to the controversy, other geneticists were unable to reproduce the results of her research. With her career stalled, Moira received a lifeline from an unlikely source: Blackwatch, the covert ops division of Overwatch under the command of Gabriel Reyes. Her involvement with Blackwatch was kept a secret until inquiries following an incident in Venice (played out in the story-based game mode \"Retribution\") revealed her work, forcing Overwatch to publicly disavow any ties to her or her work. After Overwatch disbanded, Moira was employed by the Ministries, the scientific collective that founded the city of Oasis in southern [[Iraq]], as the head of the Ministry of Genetics. She was also financed by Talon, and (along with Doomfist and Reaper) is among the members of its ruling council who appear in the game.

Rather than moving on foot, he floats above the ground in a meditative pose. He is surrounded by a circle of 8 floating metal orbs named the ''Orbs of Destruction'' (resembling [[prayer beads]]), which he can use to launch a form of energy to damage foes, either one at a time or through a charged-shot. He can also cast these orbs onto teammates as ''Orbs of Harmony'' to regenerate health, or onto enemies as ''Orbs of Discord'' that lower their defenses. His ultimate ability is ''Transcendence'', which makes him temporarily invulnerable and applies massive regenerative effects to his allies in a large radius around him.\n\nZenyatta belonged to the Shambali, an order of omnic monks that had settled in a monastery deep within the [[Himalayas]] in northern [[Nepal]], after experiencing a \"spiritual awakening\" that led them to believe that, like humans, omnics also possessed a soul. Their leader, Tekhartha Mondatta, sought to heal the breach between humans and omnics and bring them into societal harmony through the spreading of their peaceful message in public rallies (one of which resulted in Mondatta's assassination by Widowmaker in London). Zenyatta disagreed with this approach, believing that only directly engaging humans and connecting with them person-to-person will bridge the divide between man and machine. He left the Shambali monastery and wandered the world, seeking to help those he meets find inner peace (such as his encounter with the cyborg warrior Genji). He made Genji, a cyborg, more relaxed and made him understand the purpose of his metallic body.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/zenyatta/|title=Zenyatta - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nZenyatta is voiced by [[Feodor Chin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twinfinite.net/gallery/here-are-the-voice-actors-of-the-overwatch-cast/5|title=Here Are the Voice Actors of the Overwatch Cast|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Non-playable characters===\nThe following are characters who appear in other ''Overwatch'' media.\n\n====Antonio Bartalotti====\nAntonio Bartalotti was an [[Italian people|Italian]] businessman and member of Talon who orchestrated a terrorist attack on Overwatch's headquarters in Oslo, Norway, in the comic \"Retribution\".

Balderich was approached by Overwatch to become one of its founding members during the Omnic Crisis, but was forced to lead a defense against an army of Bastions in his home village of Eichenwalde, in the [[Black Forest]] near [[Stuttgart]]. It was during this battle that the omnics unleashed the OR14 (a progenitor to the OR15 on which Orisa is based), which overwhelmed the Crusaders and their army comrades. Retreating into Eichenwalde Castle with his friend and lieutenant Reinhardt Wilhelm, Balderich intended to stand his ground there, sending Reinhardt to protect the other troops, and giving him his Overwatch initiation medal. Armed with both his and Reinhardt's rocket hammers, Balderich held the line inside Eichenwalde Castle, destroying at least a large number of omnics to prevent them from overwhelming Reinhardt and the remaining troops, who at that point were at full retreat, that he was protecting, after which then he collapsed into the throne in the castle's great hall and died from his injuries. Many years later, Reinhardt - living in the ruins of Eichenwalde - left his tarnished Overwatch medallion on the arm of the throne next to his friend's body, before leaving to answer Winston's call to arms.\n\nThese events are briefly shown in the animated short ''The Last Bastion'', and in more detail in ''Honor and Glory'', while the \"Eichenwalde\" map sees one team trying to protect Balderich's remains in the castle from the other advancing team.<ref name=\"HonorAndGlory\" />\n\nBalderich von Adler is voiced by Michael Piatt.\n\n====Dae-hyun====\nDae-hyun is a MEKA mechanic assigned to [[#D.Va|D.Va]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/westofhouse/status/1032360277398835200|title=He's a mechanic, specifically assigned to D.Va|last=Chu|first=Michael|date=August 22, 2018|website=[[Twitter]]|access-date=August 24, 2018}}</ref> and a childhood friend of hers.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/what-is-dae-hyuns-role/195936/17 | title = What is Dae-Hyun's role? - Overwatch Forums | date = August 24, 2018 | accessdate = August 27, 2018 | website = us.blizard.com | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180828035652/https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/what-is-dae-hyuns-role/195936/17 | archive-date = August 28, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> He and D.Va have been working together in the MEKA unit.

He is known for hurling insults at the players, which vary depending on which characters are being played.\n\nHis name is a play on famous real-world director [[Alfred Hitchcock]], and the computer [[HAL 9000]] from the 1968 film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.\n\nHal-Fred Glitchbot is voiced by [[Travis Willingham]].\n\n====Dr. Harold Winston====\nDr. Harold Winston was the chief scientist of the Horizon Lunar Colony, a research base on the Moon where a group of genetically engineered gorillas resided to test the long-term effects of living in space. Harold took a special interest in one young gorilla who showed a great curiosity for the world around him, beginning with stealing Harold's glasses because he thought there would be more to see. Showing the young gorilla a view of Earth, Harold gave him a piece of advice he remembered years later: \"Never accept the world as it appears to be. Dare to see it for what it ''could'' be.\"\n\nWhen the other gorillas on the moon base rebelled, Harold and the other human scientists were killed; his prodigy took his name \"Winston\" to honor his fallen mentor, and escaped to Earth in a scratch-built rocket. Winston also kept Harold's glasses, as well as a photograph of the two of them at the Horizon colony.\n\nDr. Harold Winston is voiced by Greg Chun.\n\n====The Junker Queen====\nThe Junker Queen is the leader of the makeshift encampment of Junkertown, located in the Australian Outback.

A giant of a man, Mauga befriended Baptiste in his early days in the Talon organization. Baptiste, in turn, became one of the few people to be able to try to calm Mauga's wild tendencies. While Mauga thrived within Talon, Baptiste soon grew distant from it and left.

Their design was created by concept artist David Kang, who named them pachimari after the Korean word for \"onion\". Blizzard did not expect there to be much interest in pachimari, but there was a great deal of fan attention in the characters, with unlicensed plush toys, clothing, and other merchandise made by fans. Seeing this, Blizzard incorporated pachimari more into the game and media, including placing a \"King Pachimari\" atop the payload for the Junkertown map, and licensed official plush toys for purchase.

Overwatch continued to protect the peace until it was disbanded years later under a cloud of suspicion, but its former members have returned to the fore in light of new threats to humanity. Blizzard wanted to create a diverse set of characters to reflect a positive outlook on this near future, incorporating non-human characters and non-standard character traits.

''Overwatch'' includes casual play modes, competitive ranked play modes, and various arcade modes where special rules apply. Most game modes bring together two teams of six players each into a match and compete in one of several objective-based game types based on the randomly selected map, including taking control points and escorting a payload.\n\nA match starts with each player selecting from one of the available hero characters. The game's characters are divided into three [[character classes|role]] classifications: damage, tank, and support.{{efn|Patch 1.25 issued in June 2018 merged former \"offense\" (Doomfist, Genji, McCree, Pharah, Reaper, Soldier: 76, Sombra, and Tracer) and \"defense\" (Bastion, Hanzo, Junkrat, Mei, Torbj\u00f6rn, and Widowmaker) into a single \"damage\" role.<ref name=\"gamespot patch1.25\">\n{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-update-makes-for-friendlier-post-matches/1100-6460040/ | title = Overwatch Update Makes For Friendlier Post-Matches | first = Steve | last = Watts | date = June 26, 2018 | accessdate = June 26, 2018 | work = [[Gamespot]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180627062239/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-update-makes-for-friendlier-post-matches/1100-6460040/ | archive-date = June 27, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>}} Offense characters do the majority of the team's aggressive damage. Defense characters are equipped to guard the objective and halt the enemy's advance. Tank characters can absorb large amounts of damage for the team, and support characters share healing abilities and similar [[status effects]] for the team or against enemies.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.shacknews.com/article/94529/overwatch-best-heroes-for-new-players |title= Overwatch: Best Heroes for New Players}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.vg247.com/2016/06/01/overwatch-guide/ |title= Overwatch guide: best heroes, abilities and strategies for Blizzard's shooter |date= June 6, 2016 }}</ref> The game will warn teams if they have an imbalance in their general role selection, and certain game modes require players to select different heroes. Players are able to switch between heroes mid-match after they are killed or if they return to their team's base.\n\nEach hero character has fundamentally different attributes such as health and movement speed, at least one basic attack, and at least one unique skill, collectively referred to as a skill kit. These skills can be used repeatedly after waiting out the skill's cooldown period. Each character also has at least one powerful ultimate ability that becomes available once its meter is charged, either slowly over time or through other actions such as killing opponents or healing teammates. Once the ultimate ability is used, the player has to wait for the meter to fill again. All characters have a close-combat, low damage melee attack that can be used at any time.\n\nWinning matches earns the player experience towards experience levels in the meta-game. The player earns a [[loot box]] on reaching a new experience level, which contain a random assortment of character skins, emotes, speech lines, and other cosmetic items for each character without specific game-changing effects. Players can also purchase loot boxes with real-world money. Blizzard has provided free post-release content for the game, such as new levels and characters.<ref name=\"Shacknews: post-launch\"/> Blizzard has also introduced limited-time seasonal events, offering new cosmetic items in loot boxes, themed levels, and gameplay modes.<ref>\n{{cite web |url= https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-s-winter-update-is-now-live-404634.phtml |title= Overwatch's winter update is now live |first= Kevin |last= McClusky |date= December 13, 2016 |accessdate= December 13, 2016 |work= [[Destructoid]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161213204748/https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-s-winter-update-is-now-live-404634.phtml |archive-date= December 13, 2016 |url-status= live |df= mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'' originally featured 12 characters at its November 2014 [[BlizzCon]] convention announcement,<ref name=\"Polygon: first 12\"/> but expanded to 21 by the next year's convention.<ref name=\"Polygon: BlizzCon 2015\"/> The game is character-driven, and reviewers noted ''Overwatch''{{'s}} emphasis on the individual differences between characters in the same role (e.g., between two snipers) as a departure from dominant class-based shooter paradigms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/overwatch-review/|title=Overwatch review|publisher=|date=May 28, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://kotaku.com/overwatch-the-kotaku-review-1779831636 |title= Overwatch: The Kotaku Review |first=Patricia|last=Hernandez}}</ref> Critics widely praised the game's accessible and detailed character design and its role in the game's overall success.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/5/27/11797672/overwatch-review|title=Overwatch review |first=Russ |last=Frushtick |date= May 27, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/overwatch-early-impressions-a-shooter-with-character/ |title= Overwatch early impressions: A shooter with character }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/05/27/overwatch-review/ |title= Wot I Think: Overwatch }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.wired.com/2016/05/overwatch-first-impressions/|title=Overwatch: A Laid-Back Shooter Without the Crappy Attitudes }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/im-more-excited-for-overwatchs-world-than-its-gameplay |title= I'm more excited for Overwatch's world than its gameplay |website= pcgamer |access-date= June 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\nSimilar to Valve's initial launch of ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.destructoid.com/keep-these-overwatch-animated-shorts-coming-350045.phtml |title=Keep these Overwatch animated shorts coming }}</ref> in the absence of a dedicated story mode, Blizzard tells the backstory of ''Overwatch''{{'s}} plot and characters through media outside the game, including animated shorts, character press events, tweets, and webcomics.<ref name=\"Polygon: lore\">{{cite web |url= http://www.polygon.com/2016/5/24/11722688/overwatch-timeline |title=The definitive Overwatch timeline |first=Jeff |last=Ramos |date=May 24, 2016|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/07/blizzcon-2015-overwatch-animated-shorts-announced |title= BlizzCon 2015: Overwatch Animated Shorts Announced |first= Seth G.|last=Macy }}</ref> The game's story centers around a [[technological singularity]] in which humanity assembles a team of its best heroes, Overwatch, to fight off a rogue [[artificial intelligence]] and its robotic army of Omnics in an incident called the \"Omnic Crisis\".

Blizzard found players reacted negatively to this deployment, and have opted to avoid this type of prolonged teasing for future characters.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-upcoming-heroes | title = Blizzard don't tease upcoming Overwatch heroes as much due to Sombra ARG feedback | first = Kirk | last = McLeand | date = February 16, 2017 | accessdate = February 16, 2017 | work = [[PCGamesN]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170217022549/https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-upcoming-heroes | archive-date = February 17, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> Blizzard will still seed upcoming hero characters into the game's announcement media but without making comments towards that, anticipating players would find these before the character is officially announced; for example, the 26th hero Moira had appeared in at least two works prior to her announcement.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-hero-27 | title = The next Overwatch hero has been hinted at already | first = Ben | last = Barrett | date = December 12, 2017 | accessdate = December 12, 2017 | work = [[PCGamesN]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171212185204/https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-hero-27 | archive-date = December 12, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> Once a character is announced, they are typically made available on the \"Public Test Region\" (PTR) for Windows players to try out and help provide feedback to Blizzard.

A few characters have had major overhauls, notably [[Symmetra]] (with two separate overhauls of her skill), Mercy, and Torbj\u00f6rn. Like new characters, these overhauls are tested in the PTR before released to all public regions. A major notable change, reducing the number of roles from four to three (combining \"offense\" and \"defense\" heroes into the \"damage\" category) was implemented in the PTR before being released for all players in June 2018.<ref name=\"gamespot patch1.25\"/>\n\n''Overwatch 2'' was announced in November 2019. While the sequel will add new player-versus-environment game modes, Blizzard wants to keep a shared online experience for multiplayer between the two games, so all heroes, maps, and player-versus-player game modes will be available in both ''Overwatch'' and ''Overwatch 2'', and allow matchmaking between players of the two games.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/overwatch-2-announced-blizzcon-2019/ | title = Overwatch 2 announced: New heroes, co-op story missions, and more | first=  Andy | last = Chalk | date = November 1, 2019 | accessdate = November 1, 2019 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref> With the introduction of Echo, the 32nd hero to ''Overwatch'', in March 2020, Kaplan stated that the team's focus was now on ''Overwatch 2'' and it was unlikely they would release any additional heroes prior to the game's release.<ref name=\"poly echo\"/>\n\n==Characters==\n===Tank heroes===\nTank characters broadly have a high number of hit points and often have some type of shielding to withstand damage, but tend to move slower and have lower damage output compared to the support roles.\n\n====D.Va====\n{{main|D.Va}}\nD.Va, real name Hana Song, is a [[South Korea]]n [[mecha]] pilot and former [[professional gaming|pro gamer]] from [[Busan]]. She pilots a combat mecha armed with twin ''Fusion Cannons'', shotgun-like weapons that require no ammunition or reload time. Her mecha is equipped with rocket ''Boosters'' for short bursts of flight, as well as a ''Defense Matrix'' that allows it to shoot enemy projectiles out of the air. She can also fire a volley of ''Micro-Missiles'' that do splash damage on impact.<ref name=\"vg247 sept2017\"/> D.Va's ultimate ability, ''Self-Destruct'', overloads and detonates her mecha, dealing massive damage to all enemies in a huge radius within line of sight. If her mech is destroyed (either by her ultimate or in combat), she ejects and continues to fight on foot, armed with a mid-range ''Light Gun'', until her mecha can be summoned again.\n\nTo protect its cities against a massive omnic that rose from the [[East China Sea]], the [[Republic of Korea Army|South Korean army]] developed automated battle mechs, deployed in a task force named MEKA (Mobile Exo-force of the Korean Army). As the omnic learned from its battles with the South Korean military, it disrupted the mechs' drone-control abilities, forcing the army to turn to human pilots. They elected to recruit professional gamers, who they believed possessed the necessary skills to pilot their mechs. Hana Song was the reigning ''[[StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty|StarCraft II]]'' world champion at the time, with a reputation for playing to win at all costs and showing no mercy to her opponents.

He wears a heavy suit of Crusader power armor, and carries a rocket-powered [[war hammer]] (''Rocket Hammer'') as his primary weapon. His main ability is a wide hard-light ''Barrier Field'' mounted on his arm that allows him to protect himself and teammates behind him from enemy fire. He may also launch a flaming projectile that ignores enemy barriers (''Fire Strike''), or use a rocket booster to ''Charge'' into the enemy lines, crushing them against walls. His ultimate ability, ''Earthshatter'', makes him slam his hammer against the ground, sending out a shockwave that incapacitates enemies in front of him.\n\nReinhardt Wilhelm is a decorated [[Bundeswehr]] veteran from [[Stuttgart]] who lives under a knightly code of chivalry. He served as lieutenant to Colonel Balderich von Adler, commander of the Crusaders, which served alongside the regular army to act as their shield. Reckless in his younger years, Reinhardt often left his comrades behind to find glory in battle. That would change during the battle of Eichenwalde, where he lost his left eye to the blade of an OR14 assault omnic: Retreating into Eichenwalde Castle, Balderich gave Reinhardt his Overwatch initiation medal and sent him to rejoin the others, admonishing him to \"be their shield\". Becoming the only Crusader to survive the battle, Reinhardt remained in Overwatch service well into his fifties, his code of ethics and his blunt honesty making him a respected member of the team, until he was forced to retire due to his age and left to watch as Overwatch collapsed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/reinhardt/|title=Reinhardt - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref> When Winston issued the call to arms to his Overwatch comrades, Reinhardt - living in the ruins of Eichenwalde - answered without hesitation, despite the belief of his friend Brigitte that Overwatch had tossed him aside due to his age.<ref name=\"HonorAndGlory\">\n{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2017/11/3/16604522/overwatch-reinhardt-crusaders-cinematic-honor-glory | title = The newest Overwatch cinematic, Honor and Glory, is all about Reinhardt | first = Cas | last = Marshall | date = November 3, 2017 | accessdate = November 6, 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Heroes Never Die]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171107055832/https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2017/11/3/16604522/overwatch-reinhardt-crusaders-cinematic-honor-glory | archive-date = November 7, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nReinhardt had started as one of the characters in the cancelled ''Titan'' game, as the \"Juggernaut\" character.

He can also deploy a ''Barrier Projector'' that provides a temporary spherical shield to protect himself and teammates from enemy fire. Winston's ultimate ability is ''Primal Rage'', in which he briefly gives in to \"the beast within\" to get massively increased health and powerful melee attacks with knockback, although he foregoes his primary weapon.\n\nWinston was among a group of genetically enhanced gorillas living at the Horizon Lunar Colony, a research base on the Moon, intended to test the effects of prolonged habitation in space.

When the other gorillas rose up, killed the human scientists, and took over the colony, Winston escaped to Earth in a rocket he built himself. He later joined up with Overwatch, offering his scientific expertise to the team (such as building Tracer's chronal accelerator).

He can engage a temporary ''Adaptive Shield'' that increase in strength with the more enemies that are nearby. He can use a ''Grappling Claw'' to attach to a surface, switching the mech to its Roll form, and which he can then swing around, gaining momentum and damage enemies in his path, and release at any time. He can execute a ''Piledriver'' that slams his mech into the ground, damaging and launching nearby enemies into the air. Hammond's ultimate is ''Minefield,'' which deploys a number of proximity mines around him that damage opponents.<ref name=\"gamespot hammond\">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatchs-new-hero-wrecking-ballhammond-is-live-o/1100-6460085/ | title =Overwatch's New Hero, Wrecking Ball/Hammond, Is Live On PTR; Abilities Revealed | first = Chris | last = Pereira | date = June 28, 2018 | accessdate = June 28, 2018 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}</ref>\n\nHammond, previously known as \"Specimen 8\", had been among the genetically engineered animals who resided at the Horizon facility on the Moon when the gorillas led an uprising against the human scientists. Having displayed an ability to regularly escape from his enclosure, as well as a self-taught aptitude for mechanics, Hammond constructed a capsule attached to the scratch-built rocket built by Winston, and hitched a ride with him when Winston escaped to Earth. His capsule separated from Winston's rocket and landed in the Australian Outback, where he modified the capsule into a combat mech to fight in the Scrapyard arena in Junkertown, earning him the nickname \"Wrecking Ball\". With his winnings, he upgraded the mech further to escape from the Outback and travel the world.<ref name=\"pcgamesn hammond\">\n{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-wrecking-ball-abilities-release-date | title = Overwatch's newest hero is Wrecking Ball - here are his abilities | first = Dustin | last = Bailey | date = June 28, 2018 | accessdate = June 28, 2018 | work = [[PCGamesN]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180628222949/https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-wrecking-ball-abilities-release-date | archive-date = June 28, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nThe concept of Wrecking Ball originated from a spheric robotic tank based on magnetism skills, conceived early in ''Overwatch''{{'}}s development, alongside a push for how \"cute\" they could make a hero design within the game; Wrecking Ball came about when the team, looking for a new tank character, recognized the potential linkage of ideas themed around a [[hamster ball]].

She is armed with a ''Particle Cannon'' that can either emit a continuous beam of energy or launch an energy projectile in an arc. She is also able to project a personal ''Particle Barrier'' onto herself or onto one of her teammates (''Projected Barrier''), and soaking up damage with these shields raises the power of her own attacks proportionally. Zarya's ultimate ability, ''Graviton Surge'', forms a gravity well that pulls enemies in and damages them, leaving them open to other attacks.\n\nIn her fictional backstory, Aleksandra Zaryanova's village in [[Siberia]] was on the front lines of the Omnic Crisis, which devastated the region. As she grew older, she swore to gain the strength to protect her people and homeland. She became a bodybuilder and weightlifter, expected to break a number of records in the world championships, but the dormant omnium in Siberia awakened on the eve of the tournament, and she withdrew from the competition to join the local defense forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/zarya/|title=Zarya - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nZarya was initially conceived of by artist Arnold Tsang after watching a weightlifting competition.

However, they can be more vulnerable to attacks from the other team with lower hit points than other roles.\n\n====Ashe====\nAshe, full name Elizabeth Caledonia \"Calamity\" Ashe, is an American gunslinger and leader of the Deadlock Gang, a band of [[Arms trafficking|arms-trafficking]] outlaws based in Arizona. Her main weapon is ''The Viper'', a [[lever action]] [[repeating rifle]] that can be used for short-ranged quick fire or sighted long shots. She also carries a ''[[Coach gun]]'' which can knock enemies back and propel her up or away from obstacles as well as enable limited [[rocket jumping]], and can throw ''[[Dynamite]]'' bundles that detonate after a short delay or immediately when shot with her rifle, setting opponents on fire. Her ultimate ability summons ''B.O.B.'', her Big Omnic Butler/Bodyguard, who charges forward to knock enemies into the air before laying down suppressive fire with his built-in arm cannons. Unlike deployable assets from other heroes, such as Torbj\u00f6rn's turrets, B.O.B. serves as a temporary seventh player on the team until his health is exhausted, and thus is able to capture or challenge objectives, and can be healed by allies.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://venturebeat.com/2018/11/02/overwatchs-new-hero-is-ashe | title = Overwatch's new hero is Ashe | first = Mike | last = Minotti | date = November 2, 2018 | accessdate = November 2, 2018 | work = [[Venture Beat]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181103092117/https://venturebeat.com/2018/11/02/overwatchs-new-hero-is-ashe/ | archive-date = November 3, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/blizzcon/2018/11/2/18053898/new-overwatch-hero-29-ashe-blizzcon-2018 | title = Overwatch's 29th hero is Ashe of the Deadlock Gang | first = Ashley | last = Oh | date = November 2, 2018 | accessdate = November 2, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181102215249/https://www.polygon.com/blizzcon/2018/11/2/18053898/new-overwatch-hero-29-ashe-blizzcon-2018 | archive-date = November 2, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref><ref name=\"AsheInfo\">\n{{cite web | url = https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/ashe | title = Ashe | date = November 2, 2018 | accessdate = November 2, 2018 | work = [[Blizzard Entertainment]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181103045903/https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/ashe/ | archive-date = November 3, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-bob-capture-points | title = Ashe's friend Bob can capture a point in Overwatch by himself | first = Chris | last = Capel | date = November 7, 2018 | accessdate = November 7, 2018 | work = [[PCGamesN]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181107224846/https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-bob-capture-points | archive-date = November 7, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n \nBorn into a wealthy family with connections to the world's top CEOs, Ashe was largely neglected by her parents and left in the care of their omnic butler, B.O.B. She was regularly involved in fights at school, and also in petty crime. It was a chance meeting with a local ruffian named Jesse McCree, a string of crimes they committed together, and a desire to make her own \"family\" that led her to embrace the path of the outlaw, and she was one of the four original founders of the Deadlock Gang. Spurred by Ashe's increasingly larger heists, the Deadlock Gang's quick rise to prominence resulted in violent conflicts with the other criminal organizations in the American Southwest. After years of fighting, Ashe summoned the heads of the other major groups and used her business acumen, learned from her mostly-absent parents, to convince them that they could work better, if not together, then at least not against one another, so long as they kept their word, did not work with law enforcement, respected one another's territory, and punished any sort of betrayal. No longer having to focus on squabbles with other gangs, Ashe continued to build on her reputation, earning her a place at the top of the authorities' most wanted lists.<ref name=\"AsheInfo\"/>\n\nBlizzard considered Ashe a \"unicorn\" character in that her route from conception to implementation was straightforward, a rarity from their past experience. They wanted to create a female gunslinger, but needed to differentiate her from either McCree or Reaper, and some initial designs felt too goth-like. They settled on a mix of a biker and a cowboy. A similar streamlined experience was found with B.O.B., having been already drawn into the storyboard for the animated short \"Reunion\" and became an internal favorite to bring into the game, and only required translating his design into the game. One difficulty faced by the team was how to implement and optimize B.O.B., since he is treated as another teammate while on the field, impacting the game's memory and performance.<ref name=\"ashe makingof\">\n{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/11/2/18057328/overwatch-hero-29-ashe-bob-concept-art-blizzcon-2018 | title = The making of Overwatch's next hero, Ashe (and BOB) | first = Michael | last = McWhertor | date = November 2, 2018 | accessdate = November 2, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Heroes Never Die]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181103052306/https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/11/2/18057328/overwatch-hero-29-ashe-bob-concept-art-blizzcon-2018 | archive-date = November 3, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nAshe was introduced as the 29th hero in the animated short ''Reunion'', shown at [[BlizzCon#2018|BlizzCon]] on November 2, 2018, and was available to play on the PTR on November 5.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/overwatchs-new-hero-ashe-is-now-playable-on-the-ptr/ | title = Overwatch's new hero Ashe is now playable on the PTR | first = Bo | last = Moore | date = November 5, 2018 | accessdate = November 5, 2018 | work = [[PC Gamer]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181106005129/https://www.pcgamer.com/overwatchs-new-hero-ashe-is-now-playable-on-the-ptr/ | archive-date = November 6, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> She was added to the main game for all players on November 13, 2018,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.destructoid.com/today-s-overwatch-patch-brings-out-ashe-and-more-balance-changes-531105.phtml | title = Today's Overwatch patch brings out Ashe and more balance changes| first =Jordan | last = Devore | date = November 13, 2018 | accessdate = November 13, 2018 | work = [[Destructoid]] }}</ref> and to competitive play on November 27, 2018.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/11/27/18114806/ashe-competitive-play-unlock-available | title = Ashe and Bob join Overwatch competitive play | first = Cass | last = Marshall | date = November 27, 2018 | accessdate = November 27, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Heroes Never Die]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181127234356/https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/11/27/18114806/ashe-competitive-play-unlock-available | archive-date = November 27, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> She is voiced by veteran voice actress [[Jennifer Hale]].<ref name=\"ashe makingof\"/>\n\n====Bastion====\nBastion is a combat robot-turned-explorer. It can ''Reconfigure'' between a mobile form outfitted with a submachine gun (''Configuration: Recon'') and a stationary form equipped with a [[Gatling gun]] (''Configuration: Sentry''). It also has the ability to ''Self-Repair'' and quickly regain lost health, and its ''Ironclad'' passive reduces damage taken. Its ultimate ability is ''Configuration: Tank'', which allows it to roll on treads and fire explosive rounds from a smooth-bore cannon for a short period of time.\n\nBastion is a SST Laboratories Siege Automaton E54, a battle automaton originally designed for peacekeeping purposes; during the Omnic Crisis, they were deployed against their human makers becoming a symbol of the horrors of the war. Bastion was severely damaged in the field near the German village of Eichenwalde in the [[Black Forest]] during the final days of the war, and was left dormant and exposed to the elements. For more than a decade, it became overgrown with plant life and the nests of small animals, until it unexpectedly reactivated. It had developed a fascination with nature, but its combat programming still took over whenever it encountered anything it perceived as a threat. Due to conflicts with fearful humans, Bastion largely avoids populated areas in favor of exploring the wild.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/bastion/|title=Bastion - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref> It is usually accompanied by a small bird named Ganymede, who was building a nest on it when it reactivated, and both humanizes Bastion and makes it relatable.\n\nBastion is the focus of the animated short ''The Last Bastion'', showing the moments when Ganymede inadvertently reactivated it.<ref>\n{{Citation|last=PlayOverwatch|title=Overwatch Animated Short {{!}} \"The Last Bastion\"|date=2016-08-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to8yh83jlXg|accessdate=2017-08-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827005735/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to8yh83jlXg|archive-date=August 27, 2017|url-status=live}}\n</ref> Bastion was also the first character to be made available in [[Lego]] form through official collaboration between Blizzard and [[The Lego Group]].<ref>\n{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/10/lego-overwatch-first-set-revealed-available-now | title = Lego Overwatch First Set Revealed, Available Now | first = Nick | last = Santangelo | date = October 10, 2018 | accessdate = October 10, 2018 | work = [[IGN]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181011013718/http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/10/lego-overwatch-first-set-revealed-available-now | archive-date = October 11, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> A limited-time event in 2019 allowed players the opportunity to earn a Bastion skin based on the Lego version.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/new-overwatch-event-lets-players-earn-a-lego-themed-bastion-skin/ | title = New Overwatch event lets players earn a Lego-themed Bastion skin | first = Bo | last= Moore | date = September 17, 2019 | accessdate = September 17, 2019 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref>\n\nBastion is voiced by [[Chris Metzen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/50swfk/ama_request_the_overwatch_sound_design_team/?sort=old|title=AMA Request - The Overwatch Sound design team \u2022 r/Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Doomfist====\n{{Main|Doomfist}}\nDoomfist is both the name of the titular cybernetic [[gauntlet (glove)|gauntlet]] and the title of its wielder, currently the [[Nigerian]]-born Akande Ogundimu, businessman and mixed martial artist turned mercenary.

Doomfist can charge up a ''Rocket Punch'' that lets him lunge forward and punch an opponent backwards, a ''Seismic Slam'' that launches enemies in its range a short distance towards Doomfist, and a ''Rising Uppercut'' that greatly launches a single enemy while doing damage. Each ability that successfully hits also generates personal shielding for Doomfist (''The Best Defense...'').

She also has a ''Focusing Beam'' that damages a target in the beam, with damage intensified for targets that are below half-health, including barriers. She also has a ''Flight'' ability that can launch her into the air, and her ''Glide'' passive ability allows her to hover and descend at a controlled rate with good horizontal control. Her ultimate ability is ''Duplicate'', which allows Echo to take the appearance and ability of any Hero on the opposing team (save for Echo) for 15 seconds, with an accelerated ultimate gain rate.<ref name=\"poly echo\">{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2020/3/19/21186567/overwatch-echo-release-ptr-new-hero-abilities-ult-blizzard | title = Meet Echo, Overwatch\u2019s new hero with \u2018the most game-changing\u2019 powers yet | first = Sarah | last= LeBeouf | date = March 19, 2020 | accessdate = March 19, 2020  |work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref>\n\nDr. Liao was one of the scientists that had created the Omnics while part of the Omnica Corporation, and who had joined the newly-found Overwatch to deal with the Omnic Crisis.

But once they established the character's name as Echo, implying what her abilities may be including her Duplicate ultimate, this made the choice of a support role a poor one, as during the use of Duplicate her teammates would not have her normal support abilities.

His main attack method is to throw three ''[[Shurikens]]'', either in quick succession or simultaneously in a horizontal spread. His abilities are ''Swift Strike'', a quick dashing lunge with good range, and ''Deflect'', a defensive stance that briefly ricochets projectiles back at enemies with his [[wakizashi]]. His ''Cyber-Agility'' allows him to double-jump and run up walls. Genji's ultimate ability is ''Dragonblade'', during which Genji unsheathes the [[odachi]] on his back and delivers powerful, sweeping melee attacks.\n\nIn his origin story, Genji transforms from a slacker to a superhero.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://killscreen.com/articles/genji-is-with-you/|title=Genji is with you - Kill Screen|date=August 12, 2016|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/94804/overwatch-how-to-use-genji-effectively|title=Overwatch: How to Use Genji Effectively|publisher=|access-date=November 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818045314/http://www.shacknews.com/article/94804/overwatch-how-to-use-genji-effectively|archive-date=August 18, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> His family\u2014the Japanese Shimada crime family\u2014ordered his eldest brother Hanzo to kill Genji for his selfish and hedonistic behavior (as shown in the short ''Dragons''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/overwatchs-new-animated-short-explores-hanzo-and-genjis-1776890949|title=Overwatch's New Animated Short Explores Hanzo And Genji's Tragic Rivalry|last=Grayson|first=Nathan|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatchs-hanzo-and-genji-square-off-in-blizzards/1100-6439845/|title=Overwatch's Hanzo and Genji Square Off in Blizzard's Latest Short Film|publisher=}}</ref> and referenced in-game Hanamura map by a shrine devoted to Genji<ref name=\"PC Gamer: hidden lore\" />). Before he could die, Overwatch found him and their doctor Mercy restored Genji as a cyborg. After quelling the rogue artificial intelligence in the first Omnic Crisis, Genji left the Overwatch team to find peace with his new body, mentored by the Omnic Shambali monk Zenyatta.<ref name=\"Polygon: Timeline\" /> When Winston reactivates Overwatch years after the first Omnic Crisis, Genji is one of the first to return.<ref name=\"ign story 2019\">{{cite web | url = https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/07/overwatch-story-synopsis-ow-2-timeline-2 | title = Overwatch: The Story So Far | first = Matthew | last = Adler | date = November 7, 2019 | accessdate =  November 7, 2019 | work = [[IGN]] }}</ref>\n\nGameplay-wise, Genji is a flanker and an infiltrator, best suited to one-on-one fights. Since the cooldown for his ''Swift Strike'' resets upon scoring a kill, it is best used as a finishing move. Genji's ''Deflect'' ability can counter many enemy ultimate abilities, like Soldier: 76's ''Tactical Visor'' or McCree's ''Deadeye''. While some characters function best when paired with specific teammates, Genji works best in isolation.<ref name=\"Polygon: Guide\" /> Genji is strong against turrets like Bastion and those of Torbj\u00f6rn, and is effective at flanking snipers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/overwatch-how-to-play-genji|title=Overwatch - How to Play Genji|first=Mike|last=Williams|publisher=}}</ref> Genji is vulnerable against characters with energy weapons that bypass his deflection, such as Symmetra, Winston, and Zarya. As Genji is reliant on ''Deflect'', the common way to counter him is baiting him into using it then attacking when it's on cooldown. Genji's agile, melee-oriented playstyle is difficult to learn, yet is popular among new players who like his ninja design.<ref name=\"Polygon: Guide\" />\n\nA vocal minority of players began to complain about Genji's balance with other characters in August 2016, as team strategies came to be centered around his rediscovered abilities when the abilities of other offensive characters were reduced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/why-overwatch-players-hate-genji-now-1785412775|title=Why Overwatch Players Hate Genji Now|first=Nathan|last=Grayson|publisher=}}</ref> Later that month, Blizzard rebalanced Genji by reducing the power of his abilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/overwatch-test-patch-nerfs-genji-buffs-mei-and-mercy-1785424009|title=Overwatch Test Patch Nerfs Genji, Buffs Mei And Mercy|first=Nathan|last=Grayson|publisher=}}</ref> At the end of 2016, Blizzard offered a special \"[[oni]]\" character skin as a promotion for players who also played the company's [[multiplayer online battle arena]] game ''[[Heroes of the Storm]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/11/4/13524624/overwatch-oni-genji-skin-heroes-of-the-storm|title=Playing Heroes of the Storm gets Overwatch fans a special skin|date=November 4, 2016|publisher=}}</ref> Genji was added as one of the heroes in ''Heroes of the Storm'' on April 25, 2017.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-s-genji-and-hanamura-are-coming-to-heroes-of-the-storm-430678.phtml | title = Overwatch's Genji and Hanamura are coming to Heroes of the Storm | first = Chris | last = Carter | date = April 17, 2017 | accessdate = April 17, 2017 | work = [[Destructoid]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170417235847/https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-s-genji-and-hanamura-are-coming-to-heroes-of-the-storm-430678.phtml | archive-date = April 17, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nGenji is voiced by Gaku Space.<ref name=\"Eurogamer: voice actors\"/>\n\n====Hanzo====\n{{main|Hanzo (Overwatch)}}\n\nHanzo, full name Hanzo Shimada, is a [[Japan]]ese archer, assassin and mercenary. He wields the ''Storm Bow'' and is equipped with specialized arrows, including ''Sonic Arrows'' to detect enemies and ''Storm Arrows'' to fire six full-power shots in rapid succession. He is also able to ''Wall Climb'', enabling him to reach vantage points, and ''Lunge'' forward while in mid-air. His ultimate ability is ''Dragonstrike'', in which he unleashes a spiraling spirit dragon that can travel through obstacles to deal damage in a straight line.\n\nHanzo is the elder brother of Genji, and the heir to the head of the Shimada clan. He was trained from an early age to take over the clan, becoming a skilled warrior and marksman, as well as a strategist. When his father died, Hanzo was directed by the clan elders to bring Genji into line; and when Genji refused, the two brothers battled, resulting in what appeared to be Genji's death. Guilty and grief-stricken, Hanzo abandoned the clan and traveled the world in an effort to restore his honor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/hanzo/|title=Hanzo - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nHanzo is the focus of the animated short ''Dragons'', where he visits his family's castle on the day of his duel with Genji, leaving offerings at the castle shrine to honor Genji's memory.<ref name=\"Dragons\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ09xdxzIJQ|title=Overwatch Animated Short - \"Dragons\"|last=PlayOverwatch|date=May 16, 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, Hanzo had an ability called ''Scatter Arrows'', an arrow that split into multiple arrows that could ricochet off the environment and hit targets around corners. Players grew to find this ability cheap since it, if well-placed, could take out even Tank characters with a single shot. Blizzard addressed this with a rework update that replaced the ability with the above ''Storm Arrows'' and ''Lunge'' abilities, which went live in May 2018.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/03/overwatchs-hanzo-rework-goes-live-today/|title=Overwatch's Hanzo rework goes live today|last=Grubb|first=Jeff|date=May 3, 2018|work=[[Venture Beat]]|accessdate=May 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503225534/https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/03/overwatchs-hanzo-rework-goes-live-today/|archive-date=May 3, 2018|url-status=live}}\n</ref>\n\nHanzo appears as a playable hero in ''[[Heroes of the Storm]].''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/heroes/hanzo/|title=Hanzo - Heroes of the Storm|website=us.battle.net|language=en-us|access-date=2019-10-17}}</ref>\n\nHanzo is voiced by [[Paul Nakauchi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twinfinite.net/gallery/here-are-the-voice-actors-of-the-overwatch-cast/12|title=Here Are the Voice Actors of the Overwatch Cast|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Junkrat====\nJunkrat, real name Jamison Fawkes, is an [[Australians|Australian]] scavenger, mercenary and [[Anarchy|anarchist]].

Junkrat's ultimate ability is ''RIP-Tire'', a self-propelled truck wheel loaded with explosives that he's able to manually steer and detonate. Junkrat was developed by Blizzard to balance out against Torbjorn's turrets.<ref name=\"polygon sxsw\" />\n\nAfter the Omnic Crisis, an \"omnium\" - an A.I. controller that directs omnics as part of a hive mind - was destroyed in the [[Outback]], turning it into an irradiated wasteland. Living in the ruins are the Junkers, a group of scavengers and mercenaries; Jamison Fawkes was among their numbers. The effects of the radiation awakened a sense of madness which soon developed into [[pyromania]]. In the heart of the destroyed omnium, Junkrat found a valuable secret, making him the target of bounty hunters and rival gangs. He made a deal with the Junker enforcer Roadhog, who agreed to become his personal bodyguard in return for a 50-50 share of the profits from their finds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/junkrat/|title=Junkrat - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref> His loud personality often drives him into trouble, one of them is by blowing away their deception when attempting a Trojan-horse plan to get revenge on the Queen of Junkertown after banishing him and Roadhog from her dominion.<ref name=\"Junkertown: The Plan\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q0QGtk_AM0 |title= \"Junkertown: The Plan\" {{!}} Overwatch |last=PlayOverwatch|date=August 21, 2017|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nJunkrat appears as a playable hero in [[Heroes of the Storm|''Heroes of the Storm.'']]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/heroes/junkrat/|title=Junkrat - Heroes of the Storm|website=us.battle.net|language=en-us|access-date=2019-10-17}}</ref>\n\nJunkrat is voiced by [[Chris Parson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twinfinite.net/gallery/here-are-the-voice-actors-of-the-overwatch-cast/11|title=Here Are the Voice Actors of the Overwatch Cast|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====McCree====\nMcCree, full name Jesse McCree, is an [[Americans|American]] [[bounty hunter]] and vigilante with a cybernetic arm and a [[Wild West]] motif.

He can quickly dodge attacks using his ''Combat Roll'' ability which also instantly reloads his [[revolver]], and can throw a ''[[Stun grenade|Flashbang]]'' grenade a short distance which stuns enemies and interrupts their abilities.

He and his fellows were captured in an Overwatch sting operation, and he was given a choice: prison, or serving in Blackwatch, the [[black ops]] division of Overwatch. He chose the latter, believing he could make amends for his past crimes, and revelling in the lack of bureaucratic oversight.

She wields an ''Endothermic Blaster'' that can either freeze enemies in place with a short-range spray or shoot a long-range icicle projectile, and she can also use it to ''Cryo-Freeze'' herself in a solid ice block to shield herself from damage and heal injuries, as well as erect ''Ice Walls'' with many versatile uses, primarily for blocking the enemies. Her ultimate ability is ''Blizzard'', which calls down Snowball, her personal weather modification drone, to freeze all enemies in a wide radius.\n\nMei was employed by Overwatch to help discover the cause for the planet's changing climate, which had been variously blamed on industry, the increasing Omnic population, and increased consumption of natural resources. While deployed at an Overwatch research base in [[Antarctica]], Mei and the other scientists there were trapped by a polar storm that damaged the facility. Lacking sufficient resources to wait for a rescue, they decided to enter cryostasis. But the pods malfunctioned, and Mei was the only survivor when she was found close to a decade later; by that time, Overwatch had disbanded, and all of the bases set up to monitor the climate crisis had stopped functioning. Mei elected to carry on the work alone, accompanied by Snowball.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/mei/|title=Mei - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref> As she restores the base's communication system, she hears Winston's recall for Overwatch, and sets off with Snowball to make her way back to society, joining Winston and Tracer on the first mission to fight the Null Sector off in Paris.<ref name=\"ign story 2019\"/>\n\nMei is the focus of the animated short ''Rise and Shine'', showing the moments after she awakened from cryostasis and had to find a way to call for help.<ref>\n{{Citation|last=PlayOverwatch|title=Overwatch Animated Short {{!}} \"Rise and Shine\"|date=2017-08-23|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tjcm_kI0n0|accessdate=2017-08-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824133610/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tjcm_kI0n0|archive-date=August 24, 2017|url-status=live}}\n</ref>\n\nMei is voiced by [[Zhang Yu (voice actress)|Yu \"Elise\" Zhang]].<ref>\n{{Cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2017/5/1/15506768/overwatch-mei-voice-line | title = Overwatch's cutest voice line was a recording booth accident | first = Allegra | last = Frank | date = May 1, 2017 | accessdate = May 1, 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170502012601/https://www.polygon.com/2017/5/1/15506768/overwatch-mei-voice-line | archive-date = May 2, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\n====Pharah====\nPharah, real name Fareeha Amari, is an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] security officer. She wears the Raptora Mark VI, a [[Jet pack|jetpack]]-equipped combat suit, and wields a ''[[Rocket launcher|Rocket Launcher]]'' as her primary weapon. She has a Wedjat ([[Eye of Horus]]) tattoo around her right eye. Her abilities are ''Concussive Blast'', a rocket with powerful knockback but no damage, and ''Jump Jets'', a quick jetpack-assisted vertical ascension comparable to a [[rocket jump]]. Her passive ability allows her to ''Hover'' in the air, which is paired well with her Jump Jets ability. Pharah's ultimate ability is ''Barrage'', where she fires a continuous stream of small air-to-ground rockets at targets, while she is frozen still in place.\n\nFareeha Amari is the daughter of Ana Amari, one of the founding members of Overwatch. She served as an officer in the [[Egyptian Army]] and aspired to follow in her mother's footsteps, but Overwatch was disbanded before she could join its ranks. After leaving the army, Pharah took a job with Helix Security International, a private security firm contracted to protect an [[artificial intelligence]] facility below the [[Giza Plateau]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/pharah/|title=Pharah - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nPharah is a solid attacker able to consistently maintain pressure on the enemy team. Her rocket launcher allows her to hold chokepoints or lay out suppressive fire onto objectives both in offense and defense, and her vertical agility renders her out of reach for characters reliant on close-range fighting. Her ''Concussion Blast'' disrupts enemy formations, and in the hands of a skilled player it can be used to score environmental kills. Pharah is a good match with Mercy, whose ''Guardian Angel'' ability allows both of them to fly alongside each other; this tactic is often called \"Pharmercy\". Pharah is vulnerable against long-range oriented characters, especially those wielding [[hitscan]] weapons, such as Widowmaker or McCree.\n\nPharah is voiced by Jen Cohn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twinfinite.net/gallery/here-are-the-voice-actors-of-the-overwatch-cast/3|title=Here Are the Voice Actors of the Overwatch Cast|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Reaper====\nReaper, real name Gabriel Reyes, is an American mercenary and terrorist, originally a founding member of Overwatch, now a leading member of Talon. He is attired in a black hooded trenchcoat with a white skull mask and wields twin ''Hellfire Shotguns''. His abilities are ''Shadow Step'', a medium-range line of sight teleport, and ''Wraith Form'', a brief period of invincibility and speed increase. He was able to heal himself by consuming the souls of fallen enemies, visible as red burning \"Soul Globes\" on the ground but later was changed to a passive ability called ''The Reaping'' which allows him to steal a 20% heal from the damage he deals. Reaper's ultimate ability is ''Death Blossom'', a twin shotgun [[gun kata]] which deals massive damage in a short radius around him.\n\nBorn in [[Los Angeles]], Gabriel Reyes was a veteran officer of the [[United States Armed Forces]] who was subjected to a \"soldier enhancement program\", where he and the other selectees were genetically enhanced to become \"perfect soldiers\"; Reyes became known as \"Soldier: 24\". When the United Nations formed Overwatch to combat the Omnic Crisis, Reyes was one of the two men from the program on the shortlist to join up and was initially tapped to lead it. However, he was passed over in favor of his friend Jack Morrison, causing a rift between the two men. Reyes was later named commander of Blackwatch, Overwatch's black ops division, but his jealousy of Morrison (due to Morrison's publicity as the official leader of Overwatch, versus Reyes' secret dealings with Blackwatch) eventually caused Reyes to reveal Blackwatch's existence to the public, destroying both organizations and resulting in a battle that destroyed their headquarters in [[Switzerland]]. Both men were believed dead, but in reality survived, although Reyes's cells are now simultaneously decaying and regenerating, causing his body to fall apart and rebuild itself over and over again.<ref name=\"FadingGlory\">{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/blog/19809396|title=Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nReyes resurfaced years later as \"the Reaper\", a mysterious mercenary responsible for terrorist attacks all around the world, having been consumed by his hunger for fame to the point that he no longer cared what he was known for. Through the efforts of rogue geneticist and former Blackwatch member [[#Moira|Moira O'Deorain]], he has developed the ability to steal life essence from his enemies, and also become incorporeal to avoid harm.<ref name=\"polygon moira story\"/> His true identity is unknown to the rest of the world, as are his motivations, though a pattern of his movements indicates that he is hunting down former agents of Overwatch.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/reaper/|title=Reaper - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref> He appears in the cinematic trailer, teamed with Widowmaker in a raid in the Overwatch Museum to steal Doomfist's gauntlet for Talon.<ref name=\"IntroCinematic\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqnKB22pOC0|title=Overwatch Cinematic Trailer|last=PlayOverwatch|date=November 7, 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> He also appears in the animated short ''Recall'', where he raids Winston's lab at [[Gibraltar]] to steal his list of Overwatch agents, though he was unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Recall\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sB5zlHMsM7k|title=Overwatch Animated Short - \"Recall\"|last=PlayOverwatch|date=March 23, 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nReaper is a flanker/assassin type of character, able to teleport behind enemy lines and attack from the rear to single out targets of importance, before using ''Wraith Form'' to escape. The ability to heal from dealing damage helps him in taking out tanks, due to their large bodies and health pools making it easier for him to heal rapidly. Reaper is vulnerable while executing his ''Death Blossom'', so proper usage of it relies heavily on the element on surprise, taking enemies out with its massive damage output before they get the chance to react.\n\nReaper is voiced by [[Keith Ferguson (voice actor)|Keith Ferguson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twinfinite.net/gallery/here-are-the-voice-actors-of-the-overwatch-cast/6|title=Here Are the Voice Actors of the Overwatch Cast|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Soldier: 76====\nSoldier: 76, real name Jack Francis Morrison, is an American soldier-turned-vigilante and a founding member of Overwatch. He wears a facemask with a visor and carries an experimental ''Heavy Pulse Rifle'' equipped with an underbarrel launcher that fires three ''Helix Rockets''. His abilities are ''Sprint'', a forward run with no duration limit or cooldown, and ''Biotic Field'', a deployable device which regenerates the health of allies in the immediate vicinity. His ultimate ability, ''Tactical Visor'', puts up a [[head-up display]] that allows his rifle to automatically track enemies in his line of sight for a brief period, similar to an [[aimbot]].\n\nJack Morrison was born in rural [[Indiana]], and enlisted in the United States military when he was eighteen. His bravery and work ethic earned him the attention of the \"soldier enhancement program\", and he later joined Overwatch alongside his friend Gabriel Reyes. His contributions to its success in ending the Omnic Crisis led to his being granted command of the task force, leading to a rift between him and Reyes. As Overwatch came under worldwide scrutiny due to allegations of corruption, the tensions between the two men came to outright conflict, resulting in the destruction of Overwatch headquarters. Morrison was believed to have been killed in the explosion, and was reportedly buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].<ref name=\"FadingGlory\"/>\n\nFive years later, however, Morrison resurfaced as the vigilante \"Soldier: 76\", becoming the focus of an international manhunt following a series of attacks against former Overwatch facilities, stealing weapons and advanced technologies. He wages a personal war to discover the truth behind the events that led to the fall of Overwatch.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/soldier-76/|title=Soldier: 76 - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref> In the \"Bastet\" short story released by Blizzard in January 2019, it is revealed that Soldier: 76 at one point had a gay relationship with a man named Vincent prior to fully investing his time into Overwatch, making him the second confirmed LGBT character of the ''Overwatch'' roster after Tracer.<ref name=\"vg247 s76 gay\">\n{{cite web | url = https://www.vg247.com/2019/01/07/overwatchs-soldier-76-confirmed-as-gay/ | title = Overwatch short story confirms that Soldier: 76 is gay | first = Shabana | last = Arif | date = January 7, 2019 | accessdate = January 7, 2019 | work = [[VG247]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190108032925/https://www.vg247.com/2019/01/07/overwatchs-soldier-76-confirmed-as-gay/ | archive-date = January 8, 2019 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nSoldier: 76 was actually developed by ''Overwatch''{{'}}s creative director [[Chris Metzen]] in the early 2000s as part of non-gaming related projects within Blizzard, and which he later adapted for a comic story used in ''[[Digital Webbing]] Presents'' #16, published in July 2004. Metzen described Soldier: 76's background here as one of a line of American \"super soldiers\" that had been implanted with microchips to give them superhuman abilities. Soldier: 76 was thought killed in an assassination attempt but instead found himself abandoned in South America with no memories of his past, only returning to the United States after a second civil war breaks out, to help try to restore order and discover his past. While ''Overwatch'' modified Metzen's original design, the game's version of Soldier: 76 still maintains the same color scheme and jacket that was used in the comic book story.<ref>\n{{Cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/one-overwatch-character-has-been-around-for-more-than-a-1773669625 | title = One Overwatch Character Has Been Around For More Than A Decade | first = Nathan | last = Grayson | date = April 28, 2016 | accessdate = May 24, 2017 | work = [[Kotaku]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170528141357/http://kotaku.com/one-overwatch-character-has-been-around-for-more-than-a-1773669625 | archive-date = May 28, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref><ref>\n{{Cite web | url = http://www.cbr.com/warcraft-diablo-creator-joins-digital-webbing-presents-16/ | title = Warcraft, Diablo Creator Joins \"Digital Webbing Presents\" #16 | date = July 7, 2004 | accessdate = May 24, 2017 | work = [[Comic Book Resources]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170825021809/http://www.cbr.com/warcraft-diablo-creator-joins-digital-webbing-presents-16/ | archive-date = August 25, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> Within ''Overwatch'' Metzen opted to use the name \"Jack Morrison\" referencing [[John Wayne]] and [[Jim Morrison]].<ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-soldier-76-middle-name | title = Soldier: 76's middle name is Francis | first = Ian | last = Bourdeau | date = September 30, 2018 | accessdate = September 30, 2018 | work = [[PCGamesN]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180930173622/https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-soldier-76-middle-name | archive-date = September 30, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nSoldier: 76 was the most popular offense character during the game's open beta.<ref name=\"Polygon: beta stats\"/> He was conceived as a \"gateway hero\" to help players that are used to modern shooters ease into the game,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://overwatch.blizzplanet.com/blog/comments/blizzcon-2014-overwatch-unveiled-panel-transcript/2|title=BlizzCon 2014 - Overwatch Unveiled Panel Transcript - Page 2 of 4 - Blizzplanet - Overwatch|date=November 24, 2014|publisher=}}</ref> but his versatility and high skill ceiling makes him a good choice for veteran players as well. He is able to perform well in almost any situation, being effective on all ranges, move quickly around the battlefield, as well as able to heal both himself and his team. On the downside, unlike other attackers, he lacks a direct specialization, and his ultimate ability has less potential impact on the game.

She is equipped with a low-damage, high-capacity ''[[Machine pistol|Machine Pistol]]'' for short range combat. Her trademark ability allows her to ''Hack'' enemies, turrets or neutral health kits. Hacked enemies cannot use their abilities, hacked turrets are disabled, and hacked health kits respawn faster and become unusable to the enemy team. Sombra also has ''Thermoptic Camo'' that gives her invisibility paired with a speed boost, and can throw down a ''Translocator'' beacon that she can later teleport to. Her passive ability, ''Opportunist'', enables her to track enemies that are low on health, even through walls. Sombra's ultimate ability is ''[[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]]'', an electromagnetic shockwave that hacks all enemies around her, as well as disabling their barriers and shields and displaying if they have fully charged ultimates.<ref name=\"gamespot sombra announced\">\n{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatchs-next-character-sombra-officially-reveal/1100-6445128/ | title = Overwatch's Next Character, Sombra, Officially Revealed | first = Chris | last = Pereira | date = November 4, 2016 | accessdate = November 4, 2016 | work = [[GameSpot]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161107181540/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatchs-next-character-sombra-officially-reveal/1100-6445128/ | archive-date = November 7, 2016 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nIn the ''Overwatch'' narrative, Sombra had been orphaned at an early age but quickly discovered her natural gift for hacking.

His armor comes equipped with a mobile forge, and he carries a ''Rivet Gun'' that shoots molten slag and a ''Forge Hammer'' for construction and melee attacks. His ''Deploy Turret'' allows him to toss a turret a short distance away, which will then self-deploy before targeting and firing on any opponent in its sights. His ''Overload'' ability briefly increases his armor, and improves his speed and attack attributes for a short amount of time. His ultimate abilitiy ''Molten Core'' allows him to shoot up to ten globs of molten metal on the ground, damaging any opponent that crosses through them.\n\nTorbj\u00f6rn Lindholm believes that technology should serve a better vision for humanity, putting him at odds with his employers, who wanted to control the weapons with artificial intelligence. His deep-seated fear of sentient machines, dismissed at first as paranoia, became reality during the Omnic Crisis, during which he was recruited by Overwatch. His engineering knowledge proved invaluable to achieving Overwatch's aim of ending the Omnic Crisis. After Overwatch was disbanded, his weapons were stolen or stashed away, and Torbj\u00f6rn has set out to ensure they are not used to harm the innocent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/torbjorn/|title=Torbj\u00f6rn - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nWhile Torbj\u00f6rn was not the first character created for ''Overwatch'', his design, meant to bridge between ''Warcraft'' and ''Overwatch'', became the baseline for nearly all other asset design for the game.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://kotaku.com/without-torbjorn-overwatch-wouldnt-be-overwatch-1792919785 | title = Overwatch's Unique Art Style Began With Torbjorn | first = Nathan | last = Grayson | date = March 2, 2017 | accessdate = March 2, 2017 | work = [[Kotaku]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170303040136/http://kotaku.com/without-torbjorn-overwatch-wouldnt-be-overwatch-1792919785 | archive-date = March 3, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> At launch, Torbj\u00f6rn would have to place a turret and then hammer on it to bring it up to a higher level, while his ultimate ''Molten Core'' would be used to give him a burst of energy and speed as well as briefly upgrading the turret to its highest value. Torbj\u00f6rn could also collect scrap left by fallen players, when he then could use to make armor pickups for his allies. Lead game designer Geoff Goodman called Torbj\u00f6rn a \"little overly defensive focused\", and wanted to make the hero more capable on offense in non-payload map.

Her ultimate ability is ''Pulse Bomb'', an explosive charge that sticks to enemies, exploding after a brief delay for massive damage.\n\nBorn in [[London]] following the events of the Omnic Crisis, Lena Oxton became the youngest test pilot in Overwatch's experimental flight program, and was tapped to test the \"Slipstream\", a fighter jet that used teleportation technology. During the test flight, a malfunction caused the craft to vanish and Tracer along with it. She was presumed dead. However, she reappeared months later, though suffering from a condition preventing her from maintaining a physical form and which caused her to vanish for hours or even days at a time. It was discovered that the accident desynchronized her molecules from time itself, a condition eventually called \"chronal disassociation.\" The enhanced gorilla scientist Winston invented the chronal accelerator to re-synchronize her with the normal flow of time.<ref>\n{{cite web|title=Overwatch Heroes - Tracer|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/tracer|website=Official Overwatch Website|accessdate=October 12, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160526154314/https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/tracer/|archive-date=May 26, 2016|url-status=live}}\n</ref>\n\nTracer was the first Hero developed for the game and used to test the gameplay mechanics.<ref name=\"arstech dev\">\n{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/when-its-done-overwatchs-director-on-the-games-finished-yet-fluid-launch/ | title = \"When it's done\": How Blizzard dragged Overwatch across the launch threshold | first = Kyle | last = Orland | date = May 25, 2016 | accessdate = June 6, 2016 | work = [[Ars Technica]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160926203638/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/when-its-done-overwatchs-director-on-the-games-finished-yet-fluid-launch/ | archive-date = September 26, 2016 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> Tracer features in the cinematic trailer, teamed with Winston as she tries to stop Widowmaker and Reaper from taking Doomfist's gauntlet.<ref>\n{{cite web|title=Overwatch Cinematic Trailer|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqnKB22pOC0|publisher=PlayOverwatch|accessdate=October 12, 2016|date=November 7, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609072339/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqnKB22pOC0|archive-date=June 9, 2016|url-status=live}}\n</ref> She also appears in the cinematic short ''Alive'', as she unsuccessfully tries to stop Widowmaker from assassinating the omnic monk Tekhartha Mondatta in London.<ref name=\"Alive\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U130wnpi-C0|title=Overwatch Animated Short - \"Alive\"|last=PlayOverwatch|date=April 5, 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> Tracer is featured on the game's cover art, and is a playable hero in ''[[Heroes of the Storm]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/heroes/tracer/|title=Tracer - Heroes of the Storm|website=us.battle.net|language=en-us|access-date=2019-10-17}}</ref> It was revealed in an ''Overwatch'' comic that she identifies as a lesbian.<ref name=\"comic.playoverwatch.com\">{{cite web|url=https://comic.playoverwatch.com/en-us/tracer-reflections|title=Blizzard - Comic Book Experience|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nTracer is voiced by [[Cara Theobold]].\n\n====Widowmaker====\n{{main|Widowmaker (Overwatch)}}\nWidowmaker, real name Am\u00e9lie Lacroix, is a [[France|French]] [[sniper]] and assassin.

She also uses a ''Grappling Hook'' to reach high ledges and ''Venom Mines'' to disable enemies. Her ultimate ability is ''Infra-Sight'', which activates her recon visor to highlight all enemies through walls for her and her team, similar to a [[Cheating in online games#World-Hacking|wallhack]].\n\nAm\u00e9lie was a ballet dancer and was the wife of G\u00e9rard Lacroix, an Overwatch agent heading operations against the terrorist organization known as Talon. When their assassins were unable to get close to Lacroix, they kidnapped Am\u00e9lie and reprogrammed her as a sleeper agent. She was found and returned home by Overwatch agents, unaware of what had happened; two weeks later, she killed her husband in his sleep. Returning to Talon, she underwent extensive training in the covert arts, and her physiology was altered to slow her heart, turning her skin blue. Her emotional responses numbed by the conditioning, she feels little more than the satisfaction of the kill.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/widowmaker/|title=Widowmaker - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nWidowmaker appears in the intro cinematic, teamed with Reaper to steal Doomfist's gauntlet from the Overwatch Museum; a boy visiting the museum uses it against her.<ref name=\"IntroCinematic\"/> She is also featured in the animated short ''Alive'', on a mission to assassinate the omnic monk Tekhartha Mondatta, an advocate for peaceful human-omnic relations.<ref name=\"Alive\"/>\n\nWidowmaker was the most popular defense character during the game's open beta.<ref name=\"Polygon: beta stats\"/>\n\nWidowmaker is voiced by [[Chlo\u00e9 Hollings]].\n\n===Support heroes===\nSupport heroes typically lack any significant offensive abilities and instead provide support for their teammates, most often in the form of healing or other buffs. They may also be able to apply debuffs to the opposing team, making them more prone to attack. Support heroes tend to have the fewest hit points but also can self-regenerate their health at times.\n\n====Ana====\nAna, full name Ana Amari, is an Egyptian sniper and bounty hunter, and one of the founding members of Overwatch. She wields a ''Biotic Rifle'' loaded with smart darts that damage enemies and heal allies, as well as [[Tranquillizer gun|a sidearm that fires ''Sleep Darts'']]. She also carries ''Biotic Grenades'' that disable enemy healing and boost ally healing. Her ultimate ability is ''Nano Boost'', which grants an attack and defense boost to a teammate hero.\n\nHailing from [[Cairo]], Ana Amari was considered the best sniper in the world, and rushed in to support the unprepared Egyptian defense forces during the Omnic Crisis. Her marksmanship and her critical decision-making skills led to her being recruited by Overwatch, and she served for many years as Jack Morrison's second-in-command during the conflict, while trying to be a mother to her daughter, Fareeha. Even with her command responsibility, Ana refused to give up going on combat missions. Remaining in service well into her fifties, Ana was believed to have been killed by Widowmaker during a hostage rescue; when Ana hesitated to make the kill shot, realizing that her target had in fact been her friend Am\u00e9lie Lacroix, Widowmaker shot her through her rifle's lens, destroying her right eye, then proceeded to kill the hostages.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzFWIw7wV8Q|title=[NEW HERO] Ana Origin Story - Overwatch|last=PlayOverwatch|date=July 12, 2016|via=YouTube|access-date=July 12, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160713082817/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzFWIw7wV8Q|archive-date=July 13, 2016|url-status=live}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://comic.playoverwatch.com/en-us/legacy|title=Blizzard - Comic Book Experience|publisher=}}</ref> Though Ana survived, Overwatch soon disbanded.

When they started brainstorming new playable heroes, the idea of an [[alchemy|alchemist]] was raised, leading to the concept of a \"skill-based support healer\", according to Chu. This led to them to consider making Ana this new playable character, as these support sniper skills would contrast well against those of the already-established character of Widowmaker.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-lead-writer-discusses-diversity-and-new-/1100-6446434/ | title = Overwatch Lead Writer Discusses Diversity and New Webcomic | first = Jason | last = Imms | date = December 20, 2016 | accessdate = December 21, 2016 | work = [[GameSpot]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161224175838/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-lead-writer-discusses-diversity-and-new-/1100-6446434/ | archive-date = December 24, 2016 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> Ana was the first character to be added to ''Overwatch'' following its launch; she was announced and available to play on the Public Test regions on July 12, 2016,<ref>\n{{Cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-07-12-our-first-look-at-overwatchs-new-hero-ana | title = Our first look at Overwatch's new hero, Ana | first = Chris | last = Bratt | date = July 12, 2016 | accessdate = July 12, 2016 | work = [[Eurogamer]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160713160749/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-07-12-our-first-look-at-overwatchs-new-hero-ana | archive-date = July 13, 2016 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> and was playable by all PC and console players on July 19, 2016.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/overwatch-s-new-hero-ana-is-now-live-for-all-to-play-1783928089 | title = Overwatch's new hero, Ana, is now live for all to play | first = Nathan | last = Grayson | date = July 19, 2016 | accessdate = July 19, 2016 | work = [[Kotaku]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160721062559/http://kotaku.com/overwatch-s-new-hero-ana-is-now-live-for-all-to-play-1783928089 | archive-date = July 21, 2016 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> In January 2019, Blizzard published a short story \"Bastet\" that focused on Ana and her relationship with Soldier:76.

After the end of the war, Baptiste struggled to find work until he was recruited by Talon, one of a number of mercenary groups that arose in the aftermath of the crisis. At first, he thrived within Talon, which gave him easy assignments that paid well enough for him to establish a clinic in his hometown. As time went on, however, the missions his unit was sent on became increasingly violent, including assassinations of rivals and operations that involved civilian casualties.

She was named by her godfather Reinhardt Wilhelm, to whom Torbj\u00f6rn and his pregnant wife Ingrid were indebted to after Reinhardt saved his life during \"Operation White Dome\" in [[Istanbul]]. As such, Brigitte became close friends with Reinhardt, and grew up on his tales of heroes and chivalry. While Torbj\u00f6rn was more interested in creating weapons, Brigitte's aptitudes were for creating armor and defensive systems. After the fall of Overwatch, Reinhardt elected to travel the world as something of a knight-errant, and Brigitte, to his surprise, asked him if she could accompany him as his squire, to which he agreed. Her job included maintaining Reinhardt's Crusader armor, to which she was well-suited as it was based on a design created by her father, but as time went on, she was often required to take care of Reinhardt himself, who maintained an overenthusiasm for combat in spite of his increasing age and frailty. Eventually she decided that just maintaining Reinhardt's armor was not enough, and had Reinhardt train her in combat while she created her own suit of armor in secret, so that she could fight alongside him.<ref name=\"BrigitteBio\">\n{{Cite web |url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/brigitte/ |title=Brigitte - Heroes - Overwatch |access-date=February 28, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228181926/https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/brigitte |archive-date=February 28, 2018 |url-status=live  }}\n</ref> She accompanies Reinhardt to answer Winston's Overwatch recall.<ref name=\"ign story 2019\"/>\n\nShe appears in the digital comics ''Dragon Slayer'' and ''Reflections''.

Most scientists found her research dangerous due to its perceived ethical shortfalls, with some even going so far as to accuse her of having the same obsession with scientific advancement that started the Omnic Crisis. Adding to the controversy, other geneticists were unable to reproduce the results of her research. With her career stalled, Moira received a lifeline from an unlikely source: Blackwatch, the covert ops division of Overwatch under the command of Gabriel Reyes. Her involvement with Blackwatch was kept a secret until inquiries following an incident in Venice (played out in the story-based game mode \"Retribution\") revealed her work, forcing Overwatch to publicly disavow any ties to her or her work. After Overwatch disbanded, Moira was employed by the Ministries, the scientific collective that founded the city of Oasis in southern [[Iraq]], as the head of the Ministry of Genetics. She was also financed by Talon, and (along with Doomfist and Reaper) is among the members of its ruling council who appear in the game.

Rather than moving on foot, he floats above the ground in a meditative pose. He is surrounded by a circle of 8 floating metal orbs named the ''Orbs of Destruction'' (resembling [[prayer beads]]), which he can use to launch a form of energy to damage foes, either one at a time or through a charged-shot. He can also cast these orbs onto teammates as ''Orbs of Harmony'' to regenerate health, or onto enemies as ''Orbs of Discord'' that lower their defenses. His ultimate ability is ''Transcendence'', which makes him temporarily invulnerable and applies massive regenerative effects to his allies in a large radius around him.\n\nZenyatta belonged to the Shambali, an order of omnic monks that had settled in a monastery deep within the [[Himalayas]] in northern [[Nepal]], after experiencing a \"spiritual awakening\" that led them to believe that, like humans, omnics also possessed a soul. Their leader, Tekhartha Mondatta, sought to heal the breach between humans and omnics and bring them into societal harmony through the spreading of their peaceful message in public rallies (one of which resulted in Mondatta's assassination by Widowmaker in London). Zenyatta disagreed with this approach, believing that only directly engaging humans and connecting with them person-to-person will bridge the divide between man and machine. He left the Shambali monastery and wandered the world, seeking to help those he meets find inner peace (such as his encounter with the cyborg warrior Genji). He made Genji, a cyborg, more relaxed and made him understand the purpose of his metallic body.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/zenyatta/|title=Zenyatta - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nZenyatta is voiced by [[Feodor Chin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twinfinite.net/gallery/here-are-the-voice-actors-of-the-overwatch-cast/5|title=Here Are the Voice Actors of the Overwatch Cast|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Non-playable characters===\nThe following are characters who appear in other ''Overwatch'' media.\n\n====Antonio Bartalotti====\nAntonio Bartalotti was an [[Italian people|Italian]] businessman and member of Talon who orchestrated a terrorist attack on Overwatch's headquarters in Oslo, Norway, in the comic \"Retribution\".

Balderich was approached by Overwatch to become one of its founding members during the Omnic Crisis, but was forced to lead a defense against an army of Bastions in his home village of Eichenwalde, in the [[Black Forest]] near [[Stuttgart]]. It was during this battle that the omnics unleashed the OR14 (a progenitor to the OR15 on which Orisa is based), which overwhelmed the Crusaders and their army comrades. Retreating into Eichenwalde Castle with his friend and lieutenant Reinhardt Wilhelm, Balderich intended to stand his ground there, sending Reinhardt to protect the other troops, and giving him his Overwatch initiation medal. Armed with both his and Reinhardt's rocket hammers, Balderich held the line inside Eichenwalde Castle, destroying at least a large number of omnics to prevent them from overwhelming Reinhardt and the remaining troops, who at that point were at full retreat, that he was protecting, after which then he collapsed into the throne in the castle's great hall and died from his injuries. Many years later, Reinhardt - living in the ruins of Eichenwalde - left his tarnished Overwatch medallion on the arm of the throne next to his friend's body, before leaving to answer Winston's call to arms.\n\nThese events are briefly shown in the animated short ''The Last Bastion'', and in more detail in ''Honor and Glory'', while the \"Eichenwalde\" map sees one team trying to protect Balderich's remains in the castle from the other advancing team.<ref name=\"HonorAndGlory\" />\n\nBalderich von Adler is voiced by Michael Piatt.\n\n====Dae-hyun====\nDae-hyun is a MEKA mechanic assigned to [[#D.Va|D.Va]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/westofhouse/status/1032360277398835200|title=He's a mechanic, specifically assigned to D.Va|last=Chu|first=Michael|date=August 22, 2018|website=[[Twitter]]|access-date=August 24, 2018}}</ref> and a childhood friend of hers.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/what-is-dae-hyuns-role/195936/17 | title = What is Dae-Hyun's role? - Overwatch Forums | date = August 24, 2018 | accessdate = August 27, 2018 | website = us.blizard.com | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180828035652/https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/what-is-dae-hyuns-role/195936/17 | archive-date = August 28, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> He and D.Va have been working together in the MEKA unit.

He is known for hurling insults at the players, which vary depending on which characters are being played.\n\nHis name is a play on famous real-world director [[Alfred Hitchcock]], and the computer [[HAL 9000]] from the 1968 film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.\n\nHal-Fred Glitchbot is voiced by [[Travis Willingham]].\n\n====Dr. Harold Winston====\nDr. Harold Winston was the chief scientist of the Horizon Lunar Colony, a research base on the Moon where a group of genetically engineered gorillas resided to test the long-term effects of living in space. Harold took a special interest in one young gorilla who showed a great curiosity for the world around him, beginning with stealing Harold's glasses because he thought there would be more to see. Showing the young gorilla a view of Earth, Harold gave him a piece of advice he remembered years later: \"Never accept the world as it appears to be. Dare to see it for what it ''could'' be.\"\n\nWhen the other gorillas on the moon base rebelled, Harold and the other human scientists were killed; his prodigy took his name \"Winston\" to honor his fallen mentor, and escaped to Earth in a scratch-built rocket. Winston also kept Harold's glasses, as well as a photograph of the two of them at the Horizon colony.\n\nDr. Harold Winston is voiced by Greg Chun.\n\n====The Junker Queen====\nThe Junker Queen is the leader of the makeshift encampment of Junkertown, located in the Australian Outback.

She has shown animosity towards Junkrat and Roadhog, telling her guards to shoot the two on sight.

A giant of a man, Mauga befriended Baptiste in his early days in the Talon organization. Baptiste, in turn, became one of the few people to be able to try to calm Mauga's wild tendencies. While Mauga thrived within Talon, Baptiste soon grew distant from it and left.

Their design was created by concept artist David Kang, who named them pachimari after the Korean word for \"onion\". Blizzard did not expect there to be much interest in pachimari, but there was a great deal of fan attention in the characters, with unlicensed plush toys, clothing, and other merchandise made by fans. Seeing this, Blizzard incorporated pachimari more into the game and media, including placing a \"King Pachimari\" atop the payload for the Junkertown map, and licensed official plush toys for purchase.

In the King's Row map, a statue of him holding the hand of a human child stands near the spot where he was killed.\n\nMondatta and Zenyatta take their names from ''[[Zenyatta Mondatta]]'', a 1980 album by English rock band [[The Police]].\n\nTekharha Mondatta is voiced by [[Sendhil Ramamurthy]].<ref>https://twitter.com/westofhouse/status/834792964392116226</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Eurogamer: voice actors\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-11-09-overwatch-voice-actors-goofing-around-at-blizzcon-2016-should-make-you-smile |accessdate=November 22, 2016 |work=[[Eurogamer]] |title=Overwatch voice actors goofing around at Blizzard should make you smile |last1=Purchese |first1=Robert |date=November 9, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6mDZdNW6t?url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-11-09-overwatch-voice-actors-goofing-around-at-blizzcon-2016-should-make-you-smile |archivedate=November 22, 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"IGN: ref kits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/06/blizzard-releases-reference-kits-for-all-21-overwatch-characters|title=Blizzard Releases Reference Kits for All 21 Overwatch Characters|first=By Matt|last=Porter|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"PC Gamer: hidden lore\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/the-hidden-lore-of-overwatchs-maps/ |accessdate=November 22, 2016 |title=The hidden lore of Overwatch's maps |last=Marks |first=Tom |date=June 1, 2016 |work=[[PC Gamer]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6mDdk1Rur?url=http://www.pcgamer.com/the-hidden-lore-of-overwatchs-maps/ |archivedate=November 22, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Polygon: beta stats\">{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/5/20/11722218/overwatch-open-beta-stats-infographic|title=Overwatch open beta stats reveal most popular heroes, trillions of damage dealt and more|first=Allegra|last=Frank|date=May 20, 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Polygon: BlizzCon 2015\">{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/11/6/9684360/heres-the-launch-trailer-for-overwatchs-last-three-playable-characters|title=Here's the launch trailer for Overwatch's last three playable characters|first=Charlie|last=Hall|date=November 6, 2015|publisher=|via=www.polygon.com}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Polygon: first 12\">{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/11/7/7175427/overwatch-characters|title=A guide to the first 12 characters in Blizzard's Overwatch|first=Charlie|last=Hall|date=November 7, 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Polygon: Guide\">{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/5/23/11744852/overwatch-character-guide |accessdate= November 22, 2016 |title=Overwatch Character Guide |last=Carter |first=Chris |date=May 23, 2016 |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6mDWG6NgY?url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/5/23/11744852/overwatch-character-guide |archivedate= November 22, 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Polygon: Timeline\">{{cite web |url= http://www.polygon.com/2016/5/24/11722688/overwatch-timeline |accessdate=November 22, 2016 |title= The Definitive Overwatch Timeline |last=Ramos |first=Jeff |date= May 24, 2016 |work= Polygon.com |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6mDXkR3ZY?url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/5/24/11722688/overwatch-timeline |archivedate= November 22, 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Shacknews: post-launch\">{{cite web |url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/92436/overwatch-characters-and-maps-released-post-launch-will-be-free|title=Overwatch characters and maps released post-launch will be free }}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|4332152|Overwatch}}\n\n{{Overwatch}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of Blizzard characters|Overwatch]]\n[[Category:Overwatch (video game) characters| ]]\n", "name_user": "2600:1006:b05d:8e6b:702d:a705:1b84:180e", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eD.Va)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_of_Overwatch"}

Then there were lights all around, and there appeared the form of the lord. This is how the place came to be called as Karmanghat.\n\nOnce when the Kakatiya king Prataprudra II went for hunting, he became tired and came to a place called Lakshmipuram.

quarantine, closure of bars, social venues or schools, and social distancing. Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.<ref name=\"Imperial16March2020\" /> On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced in a press conference significant changes to the government advice, extending self isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that further measures were likely to be required in the future.<ref name=avoid/><ref name=\"Independent200317\" /> A paper on 30 March by Imperial estimated that the lockdown would reduce the number of dead from 510,000 to less than 20,000.<ref>[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-Europe-estimates-and-NPI-impact-30-03-2020.pdf COVID19 Europe estimates and NPI impact] Neil Ferguson, Imperial College London</ref>\n\nIn April, biostatistician Professor [[Sheila Bird]] said that delays in the reporting of deaths from the virus mean that there is a risk of underestimating the steepness of the rising epidemic trend.<ref name=guardian0404>{{cite web|author=Caelainn Barr, Pamela Duncan and Niamh McIntyre |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/why-what-we-think-we-know-about-the-uks-coronavirus-death-toll-is-wrong |title=Why what we think we know about the UK's coronavirus death toll is wrong &#124;

quarantine, closure of bars, social venues or schools, and social distancing. Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.<ref name=\"Imperial16March2020\" /> On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced in a press conference significant changes to the government advice, extending self isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that further measures were likely to be required in the future.<ref name=avoid/><ref name=\"Independent200317\" /> A paper on 30 March by Imperial estimated that the lockdown would reduce the number of dead from 510,000 to less than 20,000.<ref>[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-Europe-estimates-and-NPI-impact-30-03-2020.pdf COVID19 Europe estimates and NPI impact] Neil Ferguson, Imperial College London</ref>\n\nIn April, biostatistician Professor [[Sheila Bird]] said that delays in the reporting of deaths from the virus mean that there is a risk of underestimating the steepness of the rising epidemic trend.<ref name=guardian0404>{{cite web|author=Caelainn Barr, Pamela Duncan and Niamh McIntyre |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/why-what-we-think-we-know-about-the-uks-coronavirus-death-toll-is-wrong |title=Why what we think we know about the UK's coronavirus death toll is wrong &#124;

The craft was launched from [[Kennedy Space Center]] on April 11, 1970, but the lunar landing was aborted after an oxygen tank in the [[Apollo command and service module#Service module (SM)|service module]] (SM) failed two days into the mission. The crew instead looped around the Moon, and returned safely to Earth on April 17. The mission was commanded by [[Jim Lovell]] with [[Jack Swigert]] as [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module]] (CM) pilot and [[Fred Haise]] as [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]] (LM) pilot. Swigert was a late replacement for [[Ken Mattingly]], who was grounded after exposure to [[rubella]].\n\nAccidental ignition of damaged wire insulation inside the oxygen tank as it was being routinely stirred caused an explosion that vented the tank's contents. Without oxygen, needed both for breathing and for generating electric power, the SM's propulsion and life support systems could not operate. The CM's systems had to be shut down to conserve its remaining resources for reentry, forcing the crew to transfer to the LM as a lifeboat. With the lunar landing canceled, mission controllers worked to bring the crew home alive.\n\nAlthough the LM was designed to support two men on the lunar surface for two days, [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] in Houston improvised new procedures so it could support three men for four days. The crew experienced great hardship caused by limited power, a chilly and wet cabin and a shortage of [[potable water]]. There was a critical need to adapt the CM's cartridges for the [[carbon dioxide]] removal system to work in the LM; the crew and mission controllers were successful in improvising a solution. The astronauts' peril briefly renewed interest in the Apollo program; tens of millions watched the splashdown in the [[South Pacific Ocean]] by television.\n\nAn investigative review board found fault with preflight testing of the oxygen tank and the fact that [[Teflon]] was placed inside it. The board recommended changes, including minimizing the use of potentially combustible items inside the tank; this was done for [[Apollo 14]]. The story of Apollo&nbsp;13 has been dramatized several times, most notably in the 1995 film ''[[Apollo&nbsp;13 (film)|Apollo&nbsp;13]]''.\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1961, U.S. President [[John F.

Each member of the prime crew spent over 400 hours in simulators of the CM and (for Lovell and Haise) of the LM at KSC and at Houston, some of which involved the flight controllers at Mission Control.{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|p=104}} Flight controllers participated in many simulations of problems with the spacecraft in flight, which taught them how to react in an emergency.<ref name = \"Cass 1\" />  Specialized simulators at other locations were also used by the crew members.{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|p=104}}\n\nThe astronauts of Apollo 11 had minimal time for geology training, with only six months between crew assignment and launch; higher priorities took much of their time.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|p=100}} Apollo 12 saw more such training, including practice in the field, using a CAPCOM and a simulated backroom of scientists, to whom the astronauts had to describe what they saw.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|pp=103\u2013104}} Scientist-astronaut [[Harrison Schmitt]] saw that there was limited enthusiasm for geology field trips. Believing an inspirational teacher was needed, Schmitt arranged for Lovell and Haise to meet his old professor, [[Caltech]]'s [[Leon Silver|Lee Silver]]. The two astronauts, and backups Young and Duke, went on a field trip with Silver at their own time and expense. At the end of their week together, Lovell made Silver their geology mentor, who would be extensively involved in the geology planning for Apollo&nbsp;13.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|pp=107\u2013111}} [[Farouk El-Baz]] oversaw the training of Mattingly and his backup, Swigert, which involved describing and photographing simulated lunar landmarks from airplanes.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|p=134}} El-Baz had all three prime crew astronauts describe geologic features they saw during their flights between Houston and KSC; Mattingly's enthusiasm caused other astronauts, such as Apollo 14's CMP, Roosa, to seek out El-Baz as a teacher.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|pp=141\u2013142}}\n\nConcerned about how close Apollo 11's LM, ''Eagle'', had come to running out of propellant during its lunar descent, mission planners decided that beginning with Apollo&nbsp;13, the CSM would bring the LM to the low orbit from which the landing attempt would commence. This was a change from Apollo 11 and 12, on which the LM made the burn to bring it to the lower orbit. The change was part of an effort to increase the amount of hover time available to the astronauts as the missions headed into rougher terrain.{{sfn|Harland|1999|p=53}}\n\nThe plan was to devote the first of the two four-hour lunar surface [[extravehicular activity|extravehicular activities]] (EVAs) to setting up the [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package]] (ALSEP) group of scientific instruments; during the second, Lovell and Haise would investigate Cone crater, near the planned landing site.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|p=363}} The two astronauts wore their spacesuits for some 20 walk-throughs of EVA procedures, including sample gathering and use of tools and other equipment. They flew in the \"[[Vomit Comet]]\" in simulated microgravity or lunar gravity, including practice in donning and doffing spacesuits. To prepare for the descent to the Moon's surface, Lovell flew the [[Lunar Landing Training Vehicle]] (LLTV).{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|p=105}} Despite the fact that four of the five LLTVs and similar Lunar Landing Research Vehicles crashed during the course of the Apollo program, mission commanders considered flying them invaluable experience.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Eric M.|title=Lunar Landing Training Vehicle NASA 952|date=April 29, 2006|accessdate=July 20, 2019|url=https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/LLTV-952.html|publisher=[[NASA]]|work=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal}}</ref>\n\n== Experiments and scientific objectives ==\n[[File:Lovell and Haise geology training (S70-20253).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Lovell (left) and Haise during geology training in Hawaii, January 1970]]\n\nApollo&nbsp;13's designated landing site was near [[Fra Mauro (crater)|Fra Mauro crater]]; the [[Fra Mauro formation]] was believed to contain much material spattered by the impact that had filled the [[Imbrium basin]] early in the Moon's history.

We've had a Main&nbsp;B Bus undervolt.\"<ref name = \"journal Houston\" />\n\nLovell's initial thought on hearing the noise was that Haise had activated the LM's cabin-repressurization valve, which also produced a bang (Haise enjoyed doing so to startle his crewmates) but Lovell could see that Haise had no idea what had happened. Swigert initially thought that a [[meteoroid]] might have struck the LM, but he and Lovell quickly realized there was no leak.{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|p=293}} The Main Bus&nbsp;B undervolt meant that there was insufficient voltage flowing from the SM's three power cells (fueled by hydrogen and oxygen piped from their respective tanks) to the second of the SM's two power distribution systems. Almost everything in the CSM required power. Although the bus momentarily returned to normal status, soon both buses A and B were short on voltage. Haise checked the status of the fuel cells, and found that two of them were dead. Mission rules forbade entering lunar orbit unless all fuel cells were operational.{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|pp=293\u2013294}}\n\nIn the minutes after the accident, there were several unusual readings, showing that tank{{nbsp}}2 was empty and tank{{nbsp}}1's pressure slowly falling, that the [[Apollo Guidance Computer|computer on the spacecraft]] had reset, and that the high-gain antenna was not working.

These would be needed for the final hours of the mission, but the remaining fuel cell, already starved for oxygen, was drawing from the surge tank.

A \"direct abort\" would use the SM's main engine (the [[Service Propulsion System]] or SPS) to return before reaching the Moon. But the accident could have damaged the SPS, and the fuel cells would have to last at least another hour to meet its power requirements, so Kranz instead decided on a longer route: the spacecraft would swing around the Moon before heading back to Earth. Apollo&nbsp;13 was on the hybrid trajectory which was to take it to Fra Mauro; it now needed to be brought back to a free return. The LM's [[Descent Propulsion System]] (DPS), although not as powerful as the SPS, could do this, but new software for Mission Control's computers needed to be written by technicians as it had never been contemplated that the CSM/LM spacecraft would have to be maneuvered by the DPS. As the CM was being shut down, Lovell copied down its guidance system's orientation information and performed hand calculations to transfer it to the LM's guidance system, which had been turned off; at his request Mission Control checked his figures.<ref name = \"Cass 2\">{{cite web|last=Cass|first=Stephen|title=Houston, we have a solution, part 2|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/space-age/apollo-13-we-have-a-solution-part-2|date=April 1, 2005|website=IEEE|accessdate=August 31, 2019}}</ref>{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|pp=297\u2013298}} At 61:29:43.49 the DPS burn of 34.23&nbsp;seconds took Apollo&nbsp;13 back to a free return trajectory.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|p=369}}\n\n[[File:Mare Moscoviense AS13-60-8648.jpg|thumb|The Apollo&nbsp;13 crew photographed the Moon out of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]].]]\nThe change would get Apollo&nbsp;13 back to Earth in about four days' time{{snd}}though with splashdown in the [[Indian Ocean]], where NASA had few recovery forces. Jerry Bostick and other [[Flight controller#FDO|Flight Dynamics Officers]] (FIDOs) were anxious both to shorten the travel time and to move splashdown to the [[Pacific Ocean]], where the main recovery forces were located. One option would shave 36 hours off the return time, but required jettisoning the SM; this would expose the CM's heat shield to space during the return journey, something for which it had not been designed. The FIDOs also proposed other solutions. After a meeting involving NASA officials and engineers, the senior individual present, [[Manned Spaceflight Center]] director [[Robert R. Gilruth]], decided on a burn using the DPS, that would save 12&nbsp;hours and land Apollo&nbsp;13 in the Pacific. This \"PC+2\" burn would take place two hours after [[pericynthion]], the closest approach to the Moon.<ref name = \"Cass 2\" />  At pericynthion, Apollo&nbsp;13 set the record (per the ''Guinness Book of World Records''), which still stands, for the highest absolute altitude attained by a crewed spacecraft: {{convert|400171|km|sp=us}} from Earth at 7:21&nbsp;pm EST, April 14 (00:21:00&nbsp;UTC April 15).{{sfn|Glenday|2010|p=13}}{{NoteTag|The record was set because  the Moon was nearly at [[apogee|its furthest from Earth]] during the mission.

The resulting fire quickly increased pressure inside the tank and the tank dome failed, filling the fuel cell bay (SM Sector{{nbsp}}4) with rapidly expanding gaseous oxygen and combustion products. The escaping gas was probably enough by itself to blow out the aluminum exterior panel to Sector{{nbsp}}4, but combustion products generated as nearby insulation ignited would have added to the pressure. The panel's departure exposed the sector to space, snuffing out the fire, and it probably hit the nearby high-gain antenna, disrupting communications to Earth for 1.8&nbsp;seconds.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|pp=372\u2013373}} The sectors of the SM were not airtight from each other, and had there been time for the entire SM to become as pressurized as Sector{{nbsp}}4, the force on the CM's heat shield would have separated the two modules.

Nonetheless, the switches Beech used were not rated for 65 volts.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|p=374}}\n\nAt NAR's facility, Oxygen Tank&nbsp;2 had been originally installed in an oxygen shelf placed in the [[Apollo 10]] service module, SM-106, but which was removed to fix a potential [[electromagnetic interference]] problem and another shelf substituted. During removal, the shelf was accidentally dropped at least {{convert|2|in|cm|0|order=flip|sp=us}} because a retaining bolt had not been removed. The probability of damage from this was low, but it is possible that the fill line assembly was loose and made worse by the fall. After some retesting (which did not include filling the tank with liquid oxygen), in November 1968 the shelf was re-installed in SM-109, intended for Apollo&nbsp;13, which was shipped to KSC in June 1969.{{sfn|Accident report|pp=4-19, 4-21}}\n\nThe [[Terminal countdown demonstration test|Countdown Demonstration Test]] took place with SM-109 in its place near the top of the Saturn&nbsp;V and began on March 16, 1970. During the test, the cryogenic tanks were filled, but Oxygen Tank&nbsp;2 could not be emptied through the normal drain line, and a report was written documenting the problem. After discussion among NASA and the contractors, attempts to empty the tank resumed on March 27. When it would not empty normally, the heaters in the tank were turned on to boil off the oxygen. The thermostatic switches were designed to prevent the heaters from raising the temperature higher than {{convert|80|F|C|order=flip}}, but they failed under the 65-volt power supply applied. Temperatures on the heater tube within the tank may have reached {{convert|1,000|F|C|order=flip|-1}}, most likely damaging the Teflon insulation.{{sfn|Accident report|p=4-23}} The temperature gauge was not designed to read higher than {{convert|85|F|C|order=flip}}, so the technician monitoring the procedure detected nothing unusual.

The heaters were retained since they were necessary to maintain oxygen pressure. The stirring fans, with their unsealed motors, were removed, which meant the oxygen quantity gauge was no longer accurate. This required adding a third tank so that no tank would go below half full.{{sfn|Gatland|1976|p=281}} The third tank was placed in Bay{{nbsp}}1 of the SM, on the side opposite the other two, and was given an isolation valve that could isolate it from the fuel cells and from the other two oxygen tanks in an emergency, and allow it to feed the CM's environmental system only. The quantity probe was upgraded from aluminum to stainless steel.{{sfn|Apollo 14 Press Kit|1971|pp=96\u201397}}\n\nAll electrical wiring in Bay{{nbsp}}4 was sheathed in stainless steel. The fuel cell oxygen supply valves were redesigned to isolate the Teflon-coated wiring from the oxygen. The spacecraft and Mission Control monitoring systems were modified to give more immediate and visible warnings of anomalies.{{sfn|Gatland|1976|p=281}} An emergency supply of {{convert|5|USgal|l|order=flip}} of water was stored in the CM, and an emergency battery, identical to those that powered the LM's descent stage, was placed in the SM.

The craft was launched from [[Kennedy Space Center]] on April 11, 1970, but the lunar landing was aborted after an oxygen tank in the [[Apollo command and service module#Service module (SM)|service module]] (SM) failed two days into the mission. The crew instead looped around the Moon, and returned safely to Earth on April 17. The mission was commanded by [[Jim Lovell]] with [[Jack Swigert]] as [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module]] (CM) pilot and [[Fred Haise]] as [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]] (LM) pilot. Swigert was a late replacement for [[Ken Mattingly]], who was grounded after exposure to [[rubella]].\n\nAccidental ignition of damaged wire insulation inside the oxygen tank as it was being routinely stirred caused an explosion that vented the tank's contents. Without oxygen, needed both for breathing and for generating electric power, the SM's propulsion and life support systems could not operate. The CM's systems had to be shut down to conserve its remaining resources for reentry, forcing the crew to transfer to the LM as a lifeboat. With the lunar landing canceled, mission controllers worked to bring the crew home alive.\n\nAlthough the LM was designed to support two men on the lunar surface for two days, [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] in Houston improvised new procedures so it could support three men for four days. The crew experienced great hardship caused by limited power, a chilly and wet cabin and a shortage of [[potable water]]. There was a critical need to adapt the CM's cartridges for the [[carbon dioxide]] removal system to work in the LM; the crew and mission controllers were successful in improvising a solution. The astronauts' peril briefly renewed interest in the Apollo program; tens of millions watched the splashdown in the [[South Pacific Ocean]] by television.\n\nAn investigative review board found fault with preflight testing of the oxygen tank and the fact that [[Teflon]] was placed inside it. The board recommended changes, including minimizing the use of potentially combustible items inside the tank; this was done for [[Apollo 14]]. The story of Apollo&nbsp;13 has been dramatized several times, most notably in the 1995 film ''[[Apollo&nbsp;13 (film)|Apollo&nbsp;13]]''.\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1961, U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] challenged his nation to land an astronaut on [[the Moon]] by the end of the decade, with a safe return to Earth.<ref name = \"mission overview\" /> [[NASA]] worked towards this goal incrementally, sending astronauts into space during [[Project Mercury]] and [[Project Gemini]], leading up to the [[Apollo program]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Mercury and Gemini|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/space-race/online/sec300/sec340.htm|accessdate=February 11, 2019|publisher=[[National Air and Space Museum]]|work=The Space Race}}</ref> The goal was achieved with [[Apollo 11]], which landed on the Moon on July 20, 1969.

But the accident could have damaged the SPS, and the fuel cells would have to last at least another hour to meet its power requirements, so Kranz instead decided on a longer route: the spacecraft would swing around the Moon before heading back to Earth. Apollo&nbsp;13 was on the hybrid trajectory which was to take it to Fra Mauro; it now needed to be brought back to a free return. The LM's [[Descent Propulsion System]] (DPS), although not as powerful as the SPS, could do this, but new software for Mission Control's computers needed to be written by technicians as it had never been contemplated that the CSM/LM spacecraft would have to be maneuvered by the DPS.

Nevertheless, yet another burn was needed at 137:40:13, using the LM's [[reaction control system]] (RCS) thrusters, for 21.5&nbsp;seconds. The SM was jettisoned less than half an hour later, allowing the crew to see the damage for the first time, and photograph it. They reported that an entire panel was missing from the SM's exterior, the fuel cells above the oxygen tank shelf were tilted, that the high-gain antenna was damaged, and there was a considerable amount of debris elsewhere.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|pp=370\u2013371}} Haise could see damage to the SM's engine bell, validating Kranz's decision not to use the SPS.<ref name = \"Cass 3\" />\n\n[[File:Apollo13 splashdown.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Spaceship contacts ocean under parachute|Apollo&nbsp;13 splashes down in the South Pacific on April 17, 1970]]\n\nThe last problem to be solved was how to separate the lunar module a safe distance away from the command module just before reentry. The normal procedure, in lunar orbit, was to release the LM then use the service module's RCS to pull the CSM away, but by this point the SM had already been released. [[Grumman]], manufacturer of the LM, assigned a team of University of Toronto engineers, led by senior scientist [[Bernard Etkin]], to solve the problem of how much air pressure to use to push the modules apart.

The resulting fire quickly increased pressure inside the tank and the tank dome failed, filling the fuel cell bay (SM Sector{{nbsp}}4) with rapidly expanding gaseous oxygen and combustion products. The escaping gas was probably enough by itself to blow out the aluminum exterior panel to Sector{{nbsp}}4, but combustion products generated as nearby insulation ignited would have added to the pressure. The panel's departure exposed the sector to space, snuffing out the fire, and it probably hit the nearby high-gain antenna, disrupting communications to Earth for 1.8&nbsp;seconds.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|pp=372\u2013373}} The sectors of the SM were not airtight from each other, and had there been time for the entire SM to become as pressurized as Sector{{nbsp}}4, the force on the CM's heat shield would have separated the two modules.

During removal, the shelf was accidentally dropped at least {{convert|2|in|cm|0|order=flip|sp=us}} because a retaining bolt had not been removed. The probability of damage from this was low, but it is possible that the fill line assembly was loose and made worse by the fall. After some retesting (which did not include filling the tank with liquid oxygen), in November 1968 the shelf was re-installed in SM-109, intended for Apollo&nbsp;13, which was shipped to KSC in June 1969.{{sfn|Accident report|pp=4-19, 4-21}}\n\nThe [[Terminal countdown demonstration test|Countdown Demonstration Test]] took place with SM-109 in its place near the top of the Saturn&nbsp;V and began on March 16, 1970.

After discussion among NASA and the contractors, attempts to empty the tank resumed on March 27. When it would not empty normally, the heaters in the tank were turned on to boil off the oxygen. The thermostatic switches were designed to prevent the heaters from raising the temperature higher than {{convert|80|F|C|order=flip}}, but they failed under the 65-volt power supply applied.

The album is also notable for the absence of [[death growl|screaming vocals]]. M.

{"title_page": "Plasma railgun", "text_new": "A '''plasma railgun''' is a linear accelerator which, like a projectile [[railgun]], uses two long parallel electrodes to accelerate a \"sliding short\" armature. However, in a plasma railgun, the armature and ejected projectile consists of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], or hot, ionized, gas-like particles, instead of a solid slug of material. Scientific plasma railguns are typically operated in vacuum and not at air pressure. They are of value because they produce muzzle velocities of up to several hundreds of kilometers per second. Because of this, these devices have applications in [[magnetic confinement fusion]] (MCF), [[magneto-inertial fusion]] (MIF), [[High energy density physics|High Energy Density Physics]] research (HEDP), laboratory [[astrophysics]], and as a [[plasma propulsion engine]] for spacecraft.\n\n== Theory ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\n\nPlasma railguns appear in two principal topologies, linear and coaxial. Linear railguns consist of two flat plate electrodes separated by insulating spacers and accelerate sheet armatures. Coaxial railguns accelerate toroidal plasma armatures using a hollow outer conductor and a central, concentric, inner conductor.\n\nLinear plasma railguns place extreme demands on their insulators, as they must be an electrically insulating, plasma-facing vacuum component which can withstand both thermal and [[Acoustic shock|acoustic shocks]]. Additionally, a complex triple joint seal may exist at the breech of the bore, which can often pose an extreme engineering challenge. Coaxial accelerators require insulators only at the breech, but the plasma armature in that case is subject to the \"blow-by\" instability. This is an instability in which the magnetic pressure front can out-run or \"blow-by\" the plasma armature due to the radial dependence of acceleration current density, drastically reducing device efficiency. Coaxial accelerators use various techniques to mitigate this instability. In either design, a plasma armature is formed at the breech. As plasma railguns are an open area of research, the method of armature formation varies. However, techniques including exploding foils, gas cell burst disk injection, neutral gas injection via fast gas valve, and plasma capillary injection have been employed.\n\nAfter armature formation, the plasmoid is then accelerated down the length of the railgun by a current pulse driven through one electrode, through the armature, and out the other electrode, creating a large magnetic field behind the armature. Since the driver current through the armature is also moving through and normal to a self-generated magnetic field, the armature particles experience a [[Lorentz force]], accelerating them down the length of the gun.
