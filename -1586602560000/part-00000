''Wild, Wild Women'' was a period variation of ''The Rag Trade''.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe action centred on a fictional small clothing workshop (the title is a reference to the [[textile industry]]), ''Fenner's Fashions'' in London. Although run by Harold Fenner ([[Peter Jones (actor)|Peter Jones]]) and the foreman and pattern cutter Reg Turner ([[Reg Varney]]), the female workers are led by militant shop steward Paddy Fleming ([[Miriam Karlin]]), ever ready to strike, with the catchphrase \"Everybody out!\" Other cast members included [[Sheila Hancock]] (as Carole Taylor), [[Esma Cannon]] (as Lily Swann), [[Wanda Ventham]] (as Shirley) in series 2 and [[Barbara Windsor]] (as Gloria, during series 1, who later returned as Judy in series 3) replacing Sheila Hancock.\n\nIn 1975, a colour pilot was made, with only Peter Jones reprising his role, this colour pilot featured a young [[Tony Robinson]] (replacing Reg Varney), Gaye Brown (briefly replacing Karlin), Jumoke Debayo, [[Diane Langton]], [[Annabel Leventon]], [[Jamila Massey]], [[Mollie Maureen]] (replacing Esma Cannon) and Trixie Scales.\n\nThe theme tune for this colour pilot was performed by Alex Welsh and his Band, however, this was never transmitted, as the BBC rejected the colour revival of the series.\n\nTwo years later, the series was later revived by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] company [[London Weekend Television|LWT]], with Jones and Karlin reprising their roles. The 1977\u201378 version ran for two series, most of the scripts being based on the BBC episodes from the 1960s, and featured [[Anna Karen]] (reprising her role as Olive from ''[[On the Buses]]'') and future ''[[EastEnders]]'' star [[Gillian Taylforth]] as factory workers.\n\nThe theme tune for the LWT series was written and performed by [[Lynsey de Paul]] and released as a track on an album of T.V. themes that also featured another de Paul penned theme [[Hi Summer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Unknown-Artist-TV-Themes/release/3586598 |title=Unknown Artist \u2013 T.V.

''Wild, Wild Women'' was a period variation of ''The Rag Trade''.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe action centred on a fictional small clothing workshop (the title is a reference to the [[textile industry]]), ''Fenner's Fashions'' in London. Although run by Harold Fenner ([[Peter Jones (actor)|Peter Jones]]) and the foreman and pattern cutter Reg Turner ([[Reg Varney]]), the female workers are led by militant shop steward Paddy Fleming ([[Miriam Karlin]]), ever ready to strike, with the catchphrase \"Everybody out!\" Other cast members included [[Sheila Hancock]] (as Carole Taylor), [[Esma Cannon]] (as Lily Swann), [[Wanda Ventham]] (as Shirley) in series 2 and [[Barbara Windsor]] (as Gloria, during series 1, who later returned as Judy in series 3) replacing Sheila Hancock.\n\nIn 1975, a colour pilot was made, with only Peter Jones reprising his role, this colour pilot featured a young [[Tony Robinson]] (replacing Reg Varney), Gaye Brown (briefly replacing Karlin), Jumoke Debayo, [[Diane Langton]], [[Annabel Leventon]], [[Jamila Massey]], [[Mollie Maureen]] (replacing Esma Cannon) and Trixie Scales.\n\nThe theme tune for this colour pilot was performed by Alex Welsh and his Band, however, this was never transmitted, as the BBC rejected the colour revival of the series.\n\nTwo years later, the series was later revived by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] company [[London Weekend Television|LWT]], with Jones and Karlin reprising their roles. The 1977\u201378 version ran for two series, most of the scripts being based on the BBC episodes from the 1960s, and featured [[Anna Karen]] (reprising her role as Olive from ''[[On the Buses]]'') and future ''[[EastEnders]]'' star [[Gillian Taylforth]] as factory workers.\n\nThe theme tune for the LWT series was written and performed by [[Lynsey de Paul]] and released as a track on an album of T.V. themes that also featured another de Paul penned theme [[Hi Summer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Unknown-Artist-TV-Themes/release/3586598 |title=Unknown Artist \u2013 T.V.

been suggested that the strain might have originated from the market.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"nature feb2020\" /> However, other research indicates that visitors may have introduced the

caused the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of [[horseshoe bats]], and two viral [[nucleic acid sequence]]s found in samples taken from ''[[Chinese rufous horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus sinicus]]'' show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"MedVirEvolution\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat2\" /> A third viral nucleic acid sequence from ''[[Intermediate horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus affinis]]'', collected in [[Yunnan|Yunnan province]] and designated RaTG13, has a 96% resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat3\" /> Bats are considered the most likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2,<ref name=\"WHOChinaJoint\" /><ref name=\"LancetBinding\" /> but differences between the bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 suggest that humans were infected via an intermediate host.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" /> Nearly half of the strain's genome has a phylogenetic lineage distinct from known relatives.<ref name=\"Rejects\" />\n\nA [[metagenomic]] study published in 2019 previously revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda

identical\" to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NaturePang\" /> When released, the results clarified that \"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]] difference.\"<ref name=\"Isolation\" /> Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their [[pangolin trade|poaching and trading]] for use in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] remains common.<ref name=\"TelegraphPangolins\" /><ref name=\"NYT-Ban\" />\n\nMicrobiologists and geneticists in [[Texas]] have independently found evidence of [[reassortment]] in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in

In 1994, White discovered 4.4 million-year-old ''[[Ardipithecus ramidus]]'', a likely human ancestor from an era which was previously empty of fossil evidence.

While in certain subjects such as Mathematics, students are only required to study the Compulsory Part, while the Elective Modules are voluntary. As such, an Elective Part forms a part the subject curriculum, whereas an Extended module is designed for students with specific aim(s) or those who have higher abilities who may want additional knowledge and skills. The selection of offerings for both Elective Parts and Modules vary from school to school, for example, some schools offer both M1 (Extended Module 1) and M2 for Mathematics, while others may offer only the Compulsory Part.\n* Elective Part Example: English. The Elective Part of the English Language curriculum takes up 25% of total lesson time. The selection of Elective Parts is divided into two areas: \"Language Arts\" and \"Non-Language Arts\", each of which teaches English as used in different contexts and through various medium.<ref name=English>{{cite web|url=http://www.edb.gov.hk/FileManager/EN/Content_5999/eng_lang_final.pdf |title=English Language Curriculum and Assessment Guide |work=EMB: Senior Secondary Curriculum and Assessment Guides (Final Version) |publisher=Curriculum Development Council and the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority |accessdate=2007-06-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306130656/http://www.edb.gov.hk/FileManager/EN/Content_5999/eng_lang_final.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-06 }}</ref> During HKDSE, candidates also have the choice to write either the higher level (B2) or the standard level (B1) part of the paper, in addition to the mandatory Part A.

Speaking (Oral) components and examinations for certain Category B (Applied Learning) subjects are administered earlier. Category C (Other Languages) subjects usually take place in June (French and Spanish may be taken in the previous November), inline with CAIE AS-level practise.\n\nBefore the exam, candidates have a chance to become familiar with the different level descriptors and samples and may use them as objectives for their study. Also, they can also familiarise with the exam requirement by doing DSE Past Paper. When results are released, candidates can have a clearer picture of their attainment level. Thus, tertiary institutions and employers also have more accurate and robust information for admission or recruitment purposes.\n\n==Subjects==\nHKDSE subjects are offered in three different categories, including 24 in Category A: NSS (Traditional), over 40 in Category B: ApL (Applied Learning) and six in Category C: Other Languages.\n\n===Category A: New Senior Secondary Subjects===\nCategory A subjects are traditional school subjects. Exams in this category are held directly by HKEAA.

They are mostly vocational or professional subjects.\n\nApplied Learning Subjects may or may not be considered by tertiary institutions for admission, according to HKEAA, a reported level of \"Attained\" on the certificate is considered as equivalent to a Grade 2 in a Category A subject, and \"Attained with Distinction\" to Grade 3 or above. From 2018, \"Attained with Distinction\" has been further refined to \"Attained with Distinction (I)\" (equivalent to Grade 3) and \"Attained with Distinction (II)\" (equivalent to Grade 4 or above). However, the more prestigious universities in Hong Kong usually consider Category B subjects as mere 'Interest Groups' for admission purposes, believing them to be inferior to the traditional academic subjects in Category A.\n\nAreas of study in Category B include:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hkeaa.edu.hk/en/HKDSE/assessment/subject_information/category_b_subjects/|title=Category B: Applied Learning Subjects - HKDSE|website=www.hkeaa.edu.hk|language=en|access-date=2018-06-17}}</ref>\n\n{{columns-list|\n* Creative Studies\n* Media and Communication\n* Business, Management and Law\n* Services\n* Applied Science\n* Engineering and Production\n* Applied Learning Chinese (for non-Chinese speaking students)\n}}\n\n===Category C: Other Language Subjects===\nThese are language electives. They may be used to replace Chinese Language for university admissions for students whose first language is not Chinese, but it may not be used to replace English. It may also be chosen as an elective for native Chinese speaking students, in which case it will not serve as an alternative language for UG admission. In many cases, in lieu of a Category C subject, an [[IGCSE]] Chinese Language pass (or similar Chinese qualification) can also be accepted for admission to UG programmes for non-Chinese speaking students.\n\nCategory C subjects use the papers of [[Cambridge Assessment International Education|CAIE]] [[GCE Advanced Level (United Kingdom)|GCE AS-level]] language subjects.

While in certain subjects such as Mathematics, students are only required to study the Compulsory Part, while the Elective Modules are voluntary. As such, an Elective Part forms a part the subject curriculum, whereas an Extended module is designed for students with specific aim(s) or those who have higher abilities who may want additional knowledge and skills. The selection of offerings for both Elective Parts and Modules vary from school to school, for example, some schools offer both M1 (Extended Module 1) and M2 for Mathematics, while others may offer only the Compulsory Part.\n* Elective Part Example: English. The Elective Part of the English Language curriculum takes up 25% of total lesson time. The selection of Elective Parts is divided into two areas: \"Language Arts\" and \"Non-Language Arts\", each of which teaches English as used in different contexts and through various medium.<ref name=English>{{cite web|url=http://www.edb.gov.hk/FileManager/EN/Content_5999/eng_lang_final.pdf |title=English Language Curriculum and Assessment Guide |work=EMB: Senior Secondary Curriculum and Assessment Guides (Final Version) |publisher=Curriculum Development Council and the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority |accessdate=2007-06-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306130656/http://www.edb.gov.hk/FileManager/EN/Content_5999/eng_lang_final.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-06 }}</ref> During HKDSE, candidates also have the choice to write either the higher level (B2) or the standard level (B1) part of the paper, in addition to the mandatory Part A.

Speaking (Oral) components and examinations for certain Category B (Applied Learning) subjects are administered earlier. Category C (Other Languages) subjects usually take place in June (French and Spanish may be taken in the previous November), inline with CAIE AS-level practise.\n\nBefore the exam, candidates have a chance to become familiar with the different level descriptors and samples and may use them as objectives for their study. Also, they can also familiarise with the exam requirement by doing DSE Past Paper. When results are released, candidates can have a clearer picture of their attainment level. Thus, tertiary institutions and employers also have more accurate and robust information for admission or recruitment purposes.\n\n==Subjects==\nHKDSE subjects are offered in three different categories, including 24 in Category A: NSS (Traditional), over 40 in Category B: ApL (Applied Learning) and six in Category C: Other Languages.\n\n===Category A: New Senior Secondary Subjects===\nCategory A subjects are traditional school subjects. Exams in this category are held directly by HKEAA.

From 2018, \"Attained with Distinction\" has been further refined to \"Attained with Distinction (I)\" (equivalent to Grade 3) and \"Attained with Distinction (II)\" (equivalent to Grade 4 or above). However, the more prestigious universities in Hong Kong usually consider Category B subjects as mere 'Interest Groups' for admission purposes, believing them to be inferior to the traditional academic subjects in Category A.\n\nAreas of study in Category B include:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hkeaa.edu.hk/en/HKDSE/assessment/subject_information/category_b_subjects/|title=Category B: Applied Learning Subjects - HKDSE|website=www.hkeaa.edu.hk|language=en|access-date=2018-06-17}}</ref>\n\n{{columns-list|\n* Creative Studies\n* Media and Communication\n* Business, Management and Law\n* Services\n* Applied Science\n* Engineering and Production\n* Applied Learning Chinese (for non-Chinese speaking students)\n}}\n\n===Category C: Other Language Subjects===\nThese are language electives. They may be used to replace Chinese Language for university admissions for students whose first language is not Chinese, but it may not be used to replace English. It may also be chosen as an elective for native Chinese speaking students, in which case it will not serve as an alternative language for UG admission. In many cases, in lieu of a Category C subject, an [[IGCSE]] Chinese Language pass (or similar Chinese qualification) can also be accepted for admission to UG programmes for non-Chinese speaking students.\n\nCategory C subjects use the papers of [[Cambridge Assessment International Education|CAIE]] [[GCE Advanced Level (United Kingdom)|GCE AS-level]] language subjects.

These international qualifications are becoming more popular in Hong Kong, due to the perceived difference in difficulty and grading between HKDSE and the international qualifications, leading to the perception in some parents and students that it is comparatively easier for a student to gain entrance to local universities with an international school leaving qualification.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/family-education/article/1765551/ib-or-dse-pros-and-cons-hong-kong-secondary-school|title=IB or DSE?

[It is] insufficient for studying in universities.\" He proposed a minimal grade requirement for two elective subjects, which the Education Bureau rejected. He also mentioned that many students do not study the optional extended modules for Mathematics, leaving them lacking the advanced mathematics knowledge needed for science and engineering studies; it is very difficult for them to make this up in their undergraduate courses.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://topick.hket.com/article/1875385/%E6%96%87%E6%86%91%E8%A9%A63322%E4%B8%8D%E8%B6%B3%E4%B8%8A%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%B8%20%E5%BE%90%E7%AB%8B%E4%B9%8B%EF%BC%9A%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2%E5%B1%80%E5%A6%82%E5%90%8C%E6%94%9E%E6%A7%8D%E8%BF%AB%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%B8%E6%8E%A5%E5%8F%97|title=\u6587\u6191\u8a663322\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e0a\u5927\u5b78 \u5f90\u7acb\u4e4b\uff1a\u6559\u80b2\u5c40\u5982\u540c\u651e\u69cd\u8feb\u5927\u5b78\u63a5\u53d7|publisher=Hong Kong Economic Times|language=zh|date=8 August 2017|accessdate=12 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Hindrance to admission===\nSince the launch of the HKDSE, the Chinese language paper is often dubbed the 'paper of death' (Chinese: \u6b7b\u4ea1\u4e4b\u5377).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://yp.scmp.com/education/article/105960/year%E2%80%99s-hkdse-chinese-exam-was-lively-%E2%80%9Cpaper-death%E2%80%9D|title=This year\u2019s HKDSE Chinese exam was a lively \"paper of death\"|work=Young Post {{!}} South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en}}</ref> Some have the opinion that the high expectation is well-founded since Cantonese Chinese is the daily language in Hong Kong, but every year nearly half of all candidates failed the subject.

He went on further to mention two different options then considered by the Bureau and the HKEAA.

Most of the assembly and equipment are outsourced to both [[private firm]]s and [[public sector undertaking]]s. A [[consortium]] of more than 140 firms are taking part in the programme. This is a major departure from HAL's previous fighter aircraft, the [[HAL Tejas]], which used in-house production with minor outsourcing. Additionally, AMCA uses a modular method of production in order to reduce the time required for development and production. This method of production also results in increased on-schedule delivery resulting in an increased rate of production.

The [[cockpit]] features a single seat configuration which is placed high, near the air intakes and wings of the aircraft to provide good visibility to the pilot with a single bubble canopy construction.<ref name=\"dhqxnzzajv69c.cloudfront.net\" /> The aircraft features a [[Tricycle gear|tricycle landing gear]] configuration with a nose [[landing gear]] leg and two main landing gear legs. The weapons bay is placed on the underside of the fuselage between the nose and main landing gear. The AMCA is designed to produce a very small radar cross-section, to accomplish this it features serpentine shaped air-intakes to reduce radar exposure to the fan blade which increases stealth, uses an internal [[weapons bay]] and features the use of [[composite material|composites]] and other materials.<ref name=\"dhqxnzzajv69c.cloudfront.net\" /> The [[flight control surfaces]] are controlled by a central management computer system. Raising the [[Flap (aircraft)|wing flaps]] and [[aileron]]s on one side and lowering them on the other provides [[Flight dynamics (aircraft)|roll]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nA [[leading-edge root extension]] (LERX), which is a small [[fillet (aircraft)|fillet]], is situated on the front section of the intake and wings of the aircraft.  It has a typically roughly rectangular shape, running forward from the leading edge of the wing root to a point along the fuselage. Also, the AMCA has an [[In-flight refueling]] (IFR) probe that retracts beside the cockpit during normal operation.<ref name=\"dhqxnzzajv69c.cloudfront.net\"/>\n\nThe AMCA will be capable of operating in manned as well as in unmanned modes.<ref name=\"OnManoramaFeb2020\">{{Cite web|url=https://english.manoramaonline.com/news/nation/2020/02/05/amca-could-fly-undetected-during-dangerous-missions.html|title=AMCA could fly undetected during dangerous missions|last=|first=|date=February 5, 2020|website=[[OnManorama]]|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-06}}</ref>\n\n===Airframe===\nStressed ducts in s-shape are locked with airframe with the loaded bulkheads which are made of composite materials spanning the aircraft from air intake to engine shafts.<ref name=\"dhqxnzzajv69c.cloudfront.net\"/> The radome which holds radar is made of advance composite and construction, which result in allowing only the operating frequencies of the mated radar to transmit from the dome, while blocking other radars.<ref name=\"dhqxnzzajv69c.cloudfront.net\"/>\n\n===Flight surfaces and controls===\nSince the AMCA is a [[relaxed static stability]] design, it is equipped with a quadruplex digital [[fly-by-wire#Fly by optics|fly-by-optics]] [[flight control system]] to ease pilot handling. The AMCA's aerodynamic configuration is based on a diamond shaped trapezoidal-wing layout with shoulder-mounted wings. Its [[Flight control surfaces|control surfaces]] are [[Electro-hydraulic actuator|electro hydraulically actuated]] and digitally controlled using fiber-optic cables. The wing's outer leading edge incorporates three-section [[Leading-edge slats|slats]], while the inboard sections have additional slats to generate [[vortex lift]] over the inner wing and high-energy air-flow along the tail fin to enhance high-angle of attack stability and prevent departure from controlled flight. The wing trailing edge is occupied by two-segmented elevons to provide [[Flight dynamics|pitch and roll control]]. The only empennage-mounted control surfaces are the [[Pelikan tail]] with single-piece [[rudder]] which includes two airbrakes located in the upper rear part of the Pelikan tail, one each on either side of the tail. The AMCA feature a highly evolved integrated control laws for flight, propulsion, braking, nose-wheel steering and fuel management and adaptive neural networks for fault detection, identification and control law reconfiguration.<ref name=\"spsshownews.com\">{{cite web|url=http://spsshownews.com/exclusive/?id=31&h=The-IAF-s-Generation-Dream|title=The IAF s Generation Dream \u2013  SP's Show News|work=spsshownews.com|access-date=19 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216104324/http://spsshownews.com/exclusive/?id=31&h=The-IAF-s-Generation-Dream|archive-date=16 February 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Flights controls of the aircraft are both highly integrated and independent of each other which includes flight controls, engine controls, brake and landing controls, and other systems this is possible due the active controls gears systems (ACGS).<ref name=\"dhqxnzzajv69c.cloudfront.net\"/>\n\nThe digital FBW system of the aircraft employs an advance next-generation [[Aircraft flight control systems|distributed digital flight control computer]] (DDFCC) made by ADE comprising four computing channels, each with its own independent [[power supply]] and all housed in differently placed [[Line-replaceable unit|LRU]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spsmai.com/exclusive/?id=34&q=Will-AMCA-Be-India's-Last-Manned-Fighter-Jet-Programme?|title=Will AMCA Be India's Last Manned Fighter Jet Programme? \u2013  SP's MAI|work=spsmai.com|accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref> The DFCC receives signals from a variety of sensors and pilot control stick inputs, and processes these through the appropriate channels to excite and control the elevons, rudder and leading edge slat hydraulic actuators. DFCC provides raising the wing flaps and ailerons on one side and lowering them on the other provided roll. The Pelikan-tail fins are angled at 27 degrees from the vertical. Pitch is mainly provided by rotating these pelikan-tail fins in opposite directions so their front edges moved together or apart. Yaw is primarily supplied by rotating the tail fins in the same direction. The AMCA is designed for superior high [[Angle of attack]] (AoA) performance.

The [[cockpit]] features a single seat configuration which is placed high, near the air intakes and wings of the aircraft to provide good visibility to the pilot with a single bubble canopy construction.<ref name=\"dhqxnzzajv69c.cloudfront.net\" /> The aircraft features a [[Tricycle gear|tricycle landing gear]] configuration with a nose [[landing gear]] leg and two main landing gear legs. The weapons bay is placed on the underside of the fuselage between the nose and main landing gear. The AMCA is designed to produce a very small radar cross-section, to accomplish this it features serpentine shaped air-intakes to reduce radar exposure to the fan blade which increases stealth, uses an internal [[weapons bay]] and features the use of [[composite material|composites]] and other materials.<ref name=\"dhqxnzzajv69c.cloudfront.net\" /> The [[flight control surfaces]] are controlled by a central management computer system.

Its [[Flight control surfaces|control surfaces]] are [[Electro-hydraulic actuator|electro hydraulically actuated]] and digitally controlled using fiber-optic cables. The wing's outer leading edge incorporates three-section [[Leading-edge slats|slats]], while the inboard sections have additional slats to generate [[vortex lift]] over the inner wing and high-energy air-flow along the tail fin to enhance high-angle of attack stability and prevent departure from controlled flight. The wing trailing edge is occupied by two-segmented elevons to provide [[Flight dynamics|pitch and roll control]]. The only empennage-mounted control surfaces are the [[Pelikan tail]] with single-piece [[rudder]] which includes two airbrakes located in the upper rear part of the Pelikan tail, one each on either side of the tail.

[[Saturated fat]]s are \"saturated\" with hydrogen\u2014all available places where hydrogen atoms could be bonded to carbon atoms are occupied.

[[Unsaturated fat]]s have double bonds between some of the carbon atoms, reducing the number of places where hydrogen atoms can bond to carbon atoms. These have a lower melting point and are more likely to be liquid at room temperature.\n\n== Chemical structure ==\nTriglycerides are tri-esters consisting of a [[glycerol]] bound to three [[fatty acid]] molecules. [[Alcohols]] have a hydroxyl (HO\u2013) group. Organic acids have a carboxyl (\u2013COOH) group. Alcohols and organic acids join to form [[esters]]. The glycerol molecule has three hydroxyl (HO\u2013) groups and each fatty acid has a [[carboxylic acid|carboxyl]] group (\u2013COOH). In triglycerides, the hydroxyl groups of the glycerol join the carboxyl groups of the fatty acid to form [[ester]] bonds:\n:HOCH<sub>2</sub>CH(OH)CH<sub>2</sub>OH  +  RCO<sub>2</sub>H  +  R\u2032CO<sub>2</sub>H  +  R\u2033CO<sub>2</sub>H   \u2192   RCO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH(O<sub>2</sub>CR\u2032)CH<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>R\u2033  +  3H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nThe three fatty acids (RCO<sub>2</sub>H, R\u2032CO<sub>2</sub>H, R\u2033CO<sub>2</sub>H in the above equation) are usually different, as many kinds of triglycerides are known. The chain lengths of the fatty acids in naturally occurring triglycerides vary, but most contain 16, 18, or 20 [[carbon]] atoms.  Natural fatty acids found in plants and animals are typically composed of only even numbers of carbon atoms, reflecting the pathway for their biosynthesis from the two-carbon building-block [[acetyl CoA]]. Bacteria, however, possess the ability to synthesise odd- and branched-chain fatty acids. As a result, [[ruminant]] animal fat contains odd-numbered fatty acids, such as 15, due to the action of [[bacteria]] in the [[rumen]].  Many fatty acids are unsaturated; some are polyunsaturated (e.g., those derived from [[linoleic acid]]).<ref name=Ullmann/>\n\nMost natural fats contain a complex mixture of individual triglycerides. Because of this, they melt over a broad range of temperatures. Cocoa butter is unusual in that it is composed of only a few triglycerides, derived from [[Palmitic acid|palmitic]], [[Oleic acid|oleic]], and [[Stearic acid|stearic]] acids in the 1-, 2-, and 3-positions of glycerol, respectively.<ref name=Ullmann/>\n\n===Homotriglycerides===\nThe simplest triglycerides are those where the three fatty acids are identical.

In triglyceride form, lipids cannot be absorbed by the [[duodenum]]. Fatty acids, monoglycerides (one glycerol, one fatty acid), and some diglycerides are absorbed by the duodenum, once the triglycerides have been broken down.\n\nIn the [[intestine]], following the secretion of [[lipase]]s and [[bile]], triglycerides are split into monoacylglycerol and free fatty acids in a process called [[lipolysis]]. They are subsequently moved to absorptive [[enterocyte]] cells lining the intestines. The triglycerides are rebuilt in the enterocytes from their fragments and packaged together with [[cholesterol]] and proteins to form [[chylomicron]]s. These are excreted from the cells and collected by the lymph system and transported to the large vessels near the heart before being mixed into the blood. Various tissues can capture the chylomicrons, releasing the triglycerides to be used as a source of energy. Liver cells can synthesize and store triglycerides. When the body requires [[fatty acid]]s as an energy source, the hormone [[glucagon]] signals the breakdown of the triglycerides by hormone-sensitive [[lipase]] to release free fatty acids. As the [[brain]] cannot utilize fatty acids as an energy source (unless converted to a [[ketone]]),<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1186/cc10020|pmid = 21489321|pmc = 3219306|title = Clinical review: Ketones and brain injury|journal = Critical Care|volume = 15|issue = 2|pages = 219|year = 2011|last1 = White|first1 = Hayden|last2 = Venkatesh|first2 = Balasubramanian}}</ref> the [[glycerol]] component of triglycerides can be converted into [[glucose]], via [[gluconeogenesis]] by conversion into [[dihydroxyacetone phosphate]] and then into [[glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate]], for brain fuel when it is broken down. Fat cells may also be broken down for that reason if the brain's needs ever outweigh the body's.\n\nTriglycerides cannot pass through cell membranes freely. Special enzymes on the walls of blood vessels called [[lipoprotein lipase]]s must break down triglycerides into free fatty acids and glycerol. Fatty acids can then be taken up by cells via the fatty acid transporter (FAT).\n\nTriglycerides, as major components of [[very-low-density lipoprotein]] (VLDL) and [[chylomicron]]s, play an important role in [[metabolism]] as energy sources and transporters of dietary fat.

When the body requires [[fatty acid]]s as an energy source, the hormone [[glucagon]] signals the breakdown of the triglycerides by hormone-sensitive [[lipase]] to release free fatty acids. As the [[brain]] cannot utilize fatty acids as an energy source (unless converted to a [[ketone]]),<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1186/cc10020|pmid = 21489321|pmc = 3219306|title = Clinical review: Ketones and brain injury|journal = Critical Care|volume = 15|issue = 2|pages = 219|year = 2011|last1 = White|first1 = Hayden|last2 = Venkatesh|first2 = Balasubramanian}}</ref> the [[glycerol]] component of triglycerides can be converted into [[glucose]], via [[gluconeogenesis]] by conversion into [[dihydroxyacetone phosphate]] and then into [[glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate]], for brain fuel when it is broken down. Fat cells may also be broken down for that reason if the brain's needs ever outweigh the body's.\n\nTriglycerides cannot pass through cell membranes freely. Special enzymes on the walls of blood vessels called [[lipoprotein lipase]]s must break down triglycerides into free fatty acids and glycerol. Fatty acids can then be taken up by cells via the fatty acid transporter (FAT).\n\nTriglycerides, as major components of [[very-low-density lipoprotein]] (VLDL) and [[chylomicron]]s, play an important role in [[metabolism]] as energy sources and transporters of dietary fat.

It was created by [[Chesney and Wolfe|Ronald Chesney and Ronald Wolfe]], who wrote most of the episodes. It spawned three spin-off feature films and a stage version. Despite the writers' previous successes with ''[[The Rag Trade]]'' and ''[[Meet the Wife (TV series)|Meet the Wife]]'' with the [[BBC]], the corporation rejected ''On the Buses'', not seeing much comedy potential in a bus depot as a setting. The comedy partnership turned to [[Frank Muir]], Head of Entertainment at [[London Weekend Television]], who loved the idea; the show was accepted and despite a poor critical reception became a hit with viewers.\n\nThe series is centred on the Number 11 bus, at the Luxton and District Motor Traction Company, a green and cream double-decker crewed by driver Stan Butler and his pal [[bus conductor|conductor]] Jack Harper. With its \"bawdy, comic postcard humour and resolutely working-class outlook\" the series became \"one of the most popular British comedy series of its era, if not all time.\" At the Butler household, the typical scene would involve a family argument around the breakfast table, whilst at the bus depot, there was always fun at the expense of the crew's \"eternal nemesis\" Inspector Blake, recognisable from [[toothbrush moustache]] and facial contortions.<ref>https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/on_the_buses/</ref><ref>https://networkonair.com/features/2019/02/28/on-the-buses-at-50/</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{| class=\"wikitable planrowheaders\" style=\"width: 60%; margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Character\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Played by\n!colspan=\"7\"|Series\n|-\n!

He lives with his mother Mabel, sister Olive and brother-in-law Arthur. Stan frequently chats up the [[Bus conductor|clippies]] at the bus depot and his antics often include concocting schemes to bunk off work, gain favour from girls or solve predicaments caused by his family. Though he is rarely serious, has a disregard for authority and is rude to women he deems unattractive, Stan is ultimately good-natured at heart and tries to help those he cares for. While he loves his family, he frequently subjects sister Olive and brother-in-law Arthur to jokes at their expense, and is frequently irritated by his mother's traditional morals and rules. Due to his playboy attitude towards girls and carefree approach to life, he is oftentimes blind or ignorant of his own issues such as his health, appearance and success. He mostly triumphs over his rival Inspector Blake but on occasion, has fallen foul of the Inspector's wrath. \n*[[Cicely Courtneidge]] (series 1) and [[Doris Hare]] (series 2\u20137) as Mabel \"Mum\" Butler, Stan's mother. She is a maiden in distress when it comes to money. The Butler household is forever losing money and regularly getting the electricity cut off. Mabel is frequently caught up in arguments between Arthur, Olive and Stan but manages to retain a sense of maternal order over them. She is rather traditional, believing in the sanctity of marriage and family, as well as criticising licentious behaviour in women. Despite her strong moral compass however, she sometimes turns a blind eye to Stan's equally sultry ways and near-criminal hijinx at his job.\n*[[Anna Karen]] as Olive Rudge, Stan's sister. Olive is always being criticised by her husband Arthur, even though she helps her mum with household jobs and frequently helps Stan with the decorating. Olive has twice been a clippie at the bus depot, both times being unsuccessful. She is always wanting \"an early night\" with Arthur, much to his displeasure.\n*[[Michael Robbins]] as Arthur Rudge, Stan's brother-in-law. Somewhat aloof and stuck up, he frequently resists Olive's intimate advances. His hospital operation is a frequent source of ridicule from Stan and Jack. (Although the nature of the procedure is never disclosed, it is implied to have been a [[vasectomy]] or a hernia).  Arthur is always tampering with his motorbike, which usually falls apart. Arthur has a mother (played by [[Gillian Lind]]) and a younger sister called Linda (played by [[Helen Fraser (actress)|Helen Fraser]]) who came to stay at the Butler household for Christmas then later attend the Boxing Day Social party at the bus depot.\n*[[Bob Grant (actor)|Bob Grant]] as Jack Harper, Stan's conductor, best friend (although throughout the series he regularly attempts to discredit Stan by underhanded means, such as innuendo, accusation or the like) and next-door neighbour. He and Stan are always getting into trouble and getting reprimanded by Inspector Blake. Whether it is tampering with radio controls, putting \"DIVERSION\" road signs in the wrong places or going on dates with the buxom clippies, they are always getting into scrapes. Jack is also the [[shop steward]] of the bus depot, and frequently abuses his position to thwart Blakey's schemes, usually with the catchphrase \"As shop steward I am here to tell you.....\".\n*[[Stephen Lewis (actor)|Stephen Lewis]] as Cyril \"Blakey\" Blake \u2013 the inspector at the bus depot. Whenever there is a \"brilliant idea\" at the bus depot, it is usually Blakey's. These are usually elaborate schemes to temper Stan's and Jack's frequent insubordination, or to entrap them in their misadventures in a bid to get them fired. However Blakey's schemes typically backfire with hilarious consequences, and land him either in trouble with the General Manager or in hospital.\n\n===Recurring characters===\n* [[Michael Sheard]] as the General Manager of the bus depot. He often argues with Blakey about something that the latter has done. He was also the judge at the gardening competition in the episode \"Gardening Time\".\n* Madeleine Mills and Sandra Miller as the Inspector's niece. She was played twice by Mills and twice by Miller. In her first two appearances, she and Stan are in a relationship; in the second they are engaged, but split up after a tea party at Stan's house. In her third appearance she married Bill, a bus driver at the depot. She also appeared in the episode \"The New Nurse\".\n*[[Sandra Bryant]] as Sandra, a clippie at the bus depot. Her character is seen frequently throughout the seventh series. In the first episode of the seventh series, she goes on a date with Stan to the cinema, until Olive comes along too.\n*  [[Terry Duggan]] and [[Norman Mitchell]] as Nobby \u2013 one of the bus depot's [[mechanic]]s. He often assists Stan and Jack in their typical schemes and misadventures.\n* [[Pat Nye]] as Mrs Blake, The Inspector's mother who is domineering and unpleasant and she treats him like a little boy.\n\n==Series production==\nA total of 74 episodes of ''On the Buses'' were broadcast over seven series. Three spin-off films were also released.\n\nAll episodes and films of On The Buses were set in the fictional town of Luxton.\n\nAt the beginning of the seventh series Arthur, who is not seen, has left Olive and they are divorced. Olive again gets a job as a clippie on the buses as they are short of money. Stan takes a job in the north of England in a car factory in the \"Goodbye Stan\" episode, and the Inspector takes Stan's old room as a lodger.\n\nIn addition, two five-minute Christmas specials were made by LWT as part of an ''All Star Comedy Carnival'' in 1969 and 1972, ITV's answer to the BBC's ''[[Christmas Night with the Stars]]'' programme. The 1969 edition has been lost, but the 1972 edition \u2013 featuring a goose that the cast are chasing for Christmas dinner \u2013 exists in the [[Thames Television]] archive, which is now owned by [[FremantleMedia]]. A spin-off series, ''[[Don't Drink the Water (TV series)|Don't Drink the Water]]'' (1974\u201375), ran for thirteen episodes, featuring Blake retiring to Spain with his sister Dorothy ([[Pat Coombs]]).\n\nReg Varney undertook a [[Passenger Carrying Vehicle|PCV]] driving test in order to be filmed driving the bus for the exterior scenes.\n\nThe earlier series were recorded at [[London Weekend Television]]'s original studios in Wembley (now [[Fountain Studios]]). In late 1972, LWT relocated to new studios on the [[The London Studios|South Bank of the River Thames]]; here the outside doors to the main and secondary studios were too small to accommodate the [[double-decker bus]]es used in the series. Therefore, single decker buses were used and a plywood mock-up of an upper deck was lowered from a [[Stage lighting|lighting rig]].\n\nFilmed external shots were part of the series. LWT arranged with the now defunct [[Eastern National Omnibus Company]] to use its buses at Wood Green bus garage in North London. They were shown as belonging to Luxton and District. Luxton is supposed to be in Essex, and actual Essex towns including Southend-on-Sea, Basildon, Braintree and Tilbury are all mentioned. One of the bus route termini was \"Cemetery Gates\", for which LWT used the entrance to [[Lavender Hill Cemetery]]. A different [[Lavender Hill]] in [[Battersea]] also features in the last episode of the last series, featuring the town hall, now the [[Battersea Arts Centre]].\n\nThe fourth series was affected by the ITV [[Colour Strike|colour strike]], with seven of thirteen episodes being made in black and white.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of On the Buses episodes}}\n\n==Theme music==\nThe theme music for the series, entitled \"Happy Harry\", was written by Tony Russell.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Walker |first1=Craig |title=The On The Buses Quiz Book |publisher=Andrews UK Limited |year=2012 |isbn=9781909143111 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3q5BAAAQBAJ&pg=PT267&lpg=PT267 |page=267}}</ref>\n\n==Films==\n[[File:Onthebuses.jpg|thumb|right|The series spawned three feature film spin-offs and a stage version]]\nThe three spin-off films were produced by [[Hammer Film Productions]]. They are ''[[On the Buses (film)|On the Buses]]'' (1971), ''[[Mutiny on the Buses]]'' (1972), and ''[[Holiday on the Buses]]'' (1973), set in a holiday camp. ''On the Buses'' became Britain's top box office film of 1971.\n\nThe films were set in a different [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] to the series \u2013 in the films, Arthur and Olive manage to have a child despite their apparently sexless marriage and Arthur's 'operation' \u2013 the exact nature of which was never explicitly revealed. Arthur's operation is mentioned in the first film, but later Olive gives birth to their baby son. The three films follow a loose [[story arc]] which shows their son (Little Arthur) growing up. Olive is pregnant with a second child at the end of ''Mutiny'', but no mention of this was made in the third film, ''Holiday'', set mainly in a [[Holiday camp|Holiday Camp]]. The bus depot becomes The Town & District Bus Company instead of The Luxton & District Traction Company. The buses in the films are mostly red ones, with one green one (not including the [[Windsor Safari Park]] tour bus in ''Mutiny On The Buses'').\n\n==American adaptation==\nThe format of ''On the Buses'' was sold to America, where it was remade by [[NBC]] as ''[[Lotsa Luck]]'', starring [[Dom DeLuise]] as Stanley Belmont with [[Kathleen Freeman]] as Iris Belmont, his mum, Wynn Irwin as Arthur Swann, [[Beverly Sanders]] as Olive Swann and Jack Knight as Bummy Pfitzer, his best friend. Episodes based on the original ''On The Buses'' scripts were adapted by such American writers as [[Carl Reiner]], [[Bill Persky]] and [[Sam Denoff]]. Inspector Blake did not have a counterpart in the American version; and, in another significant change to the storyline, Stan worked at the lost property office at the bus depot rather than being a driver. After a pilot was made, the sitcom ran for one series of 22 episodes in 1973\u201374.

However, although a pilot script was written, it wasn't made.

As they attempt to get the company off the ground, they discover a rival company has set up in the town, owned by none other than Blakey. The comedy in the series would have come from the conflict between the two businesses, and how Stan and Jack attempted to battle Blakey's bigger and more professional company.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Home media==\n\n===Region 1===\n[[Visual Entertainment]] released ''On the Buses: The Ultimate Collection'', an eleven-disc box set featuring the complete series on DVD on 12 September 2006.\n\n===Region 2===\n[[Network DVD]] released ''On the Buses: The Complete Series'' box set on DVD on 13 November 2006 for the very first time.

It was created by [[Chesney and Wolfe|Ronald Chesney and Ronald Wolfe]], who wrote most of the episodes. It spawned three spin-off feature films and a stage version. Despite the writers' previous successes with ''[[The Rag Trade]]'' and ''[[Meet the Wife]]'' with the [[BBC]], the corporation rejected ''On the Buses'', not seeing much comedy potential in a bus depot as a setting. The comedy partnership turned to [[Frank Muir]], Head of Entertainment at [[London Weekend Television]], who loved the idea; the show was accepted and despite a poor critical reception became a hit with viewers.\n\nThe series is centred on the Number 11 bus, at the Luxton and District Motor Traction Company, a green and cream double-decker crewed by driver Stan Butler and his pal [[bus conductor|conductor]] Jack Harper. With its \"bawdy, comic postcard humour and resolutely working-class outlook\" the series became \"one of the most popular British comedy series of its era, if not all time.\" At the Butler household, the typical scene would involve a family argument around the breakfast table, whilst at the bus depot, there was always fun at the expense of the crew's \"eternal nemesis\" Inspector Blake, recognisable from [[toothbrush moustache]] and facial contortions. <ref>https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/on_the_buses/</ref><ref>https://networkonair.com/features/2019/02/28/on-the-buses-at-50/</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{| class=\"wikitable planrowheaders\" style=\"width: 60%; margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Character\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Played by\n!colspan=\"7\"|Series\n|-\n!

He lives with his mother Mabel, sister Olive and brother-in-law Arthur. Stan frequently chats up the [[Bus conductor|clippies]] at the bus depot and his antics often include concocting schemes to bunk off work, gain favour from girls or solve predicaments caused by his family. Though he is rarely serious, has a disregard for authority and is rude to women he deems unattractive, Stan is ultimately good-natured at heart and tries to help those he cares for. While he loves his family, he frequently subjects sister Olive and brother-in-law Arthur to jokes at their expense, and is frequently irritated by his mother's traditional morals and rules. Due to his playboy attitude towards girls and carefree approach to life, he is oftentimes blind or ignorant of his own issues such as his health, appearance and success. He mostly triumphs over his rival Inspector Blake but on occasion, has fallen foul of the Inspector's wrath. \n*[[Cicely Courtneidge]] (series 1) and [[Doris Hare]] (series 2\u20137) as Mabel \"Mum\" Butler, Stan's mother. She is a maiden in distress when it comes to money. The Butler household is forever losing money and regularly getting the electricity cut off. Mabel is frequently caught up in arguments between Arthur, Olive and Stan but manages to retain a sense of maternal order over them. She is rather traditional, believing in the sanctity of marriage and family, as well as criticising licentious behaviour in women. Despite her strong moral compass however, she sometimes turns a blind eye to Stan's equally sultry ways and near-criminal hijinx at his job.\n*[[Anna Karen]] as Olive Rudge, Stan's sister. Olive is always being criticised by her husband Arthur, even though she helps her mum with household jobs and frequently helps Stan with the decorating. Olive has twice been a clippie at the bus depot, both times being unsuccessful. She is always wanting \"an early night\" with Arthur, much to his displeasure.\n*[[Michael Robbins]] as Arthur Rudge, Stan's brother-in-law. Somewhat aloof and stuck up, he frequently resists Olive's intimate advances. His hospital operation is a frequent source of ridicule from Stan and Jack. (Although the nature of the procedure is never disclosed, it is implied to have been a [[vasectomy]] or a hernia).  Arthur is always tampering with his motorbike, which usually falls apart. Arthur has a mother (played by [[Gillian Lind]]) and a younger sister called Linda (played by [[Helen Fraser (actress)|Helen Fraser]]) who came to stay at the Butler household for Christmas then later attend the Boxing Day Social party at the bus depot.\n*[[Bob Grant (actor)|Bob Grant]] as Jack Harper, Stan's conductor, best friend (although throughout the series he regularly attempts to discredit Stan by underhanded means, such as innuendo, accusation or the like) and next-door neighbour. He and Stan are always getting into trouble and getting reprimanded by Inspector Blake. Whether it is tampering with radio controls, putting \"DIVERSION\" road signs in the wrong places or going on dates with the buxom clippies, they are always getting into scrapes. Jack is also the [[shop steward]] of the bus depot, and frequently abuses his position to thwart Blakey's schemes, usually with the catchphrase \"As shop steward I am here to tell you.....\".\n*[[Stephen Lewis (actor)|Stephen Lewis]] as Cyril \"Blakey\" Blake \u2013 the inspector at the bus depot. Whenever there is a \"brilliant idea\" at the bus depot, it is usually Blakey's. These are usually elaborate schemes to temper Stan's and Jack's frequent insubordination, or to entrap them in their misadventures in a bid to get them fired. However Blakey's schemes typically backfire with hilarious consequences, and land him either in trouble with the General Manager or in hospital.\n\n===Recurring characters===\n* [[Michael Sheard]] as the General Manager of the bus depot. He often argues with Blakey about something that the latter has done. He was also the judge at the gardening competition in the episode \"Gardening Time\".\n* Madeleine Mills and Sandra Miller as the Inspector's niece. She was played twice by Mills and twice by Miller. In her first two appearances, she and Stan are in a relationship; in the second they are engaged, but split up after a tea party at Stan's house. In her third appearance she married Bill, a bus driver at the depot. She also appeared in the episode \"The New Nurse\".\n*[[Sandra Bryant]] as Sandra, a clippie at the bus depot. Her character is seen frequently throughout the seventh series. In the first episode of the seventh series, she goes on a date with Stan to the cinema, until Olive comes along too.\n*  [[Terry Duggan]] and [[Norman Mitchell]] as Nobby \u2013 one of the bus depot's [[mechanic]]s. He often assists Stan and Jack in their typical schemes and misadventures.\n* [[Pat Nye]] as Mrs Blake, The Inspector's mother who is domineering and unpleasant and she treats him like a little boy.\n\n==Series production==\nA total of 74 episodes of ''On the Buses'' were broadcast over seven series. Three spin-off films were also released.\n\nAll episodes and films of On The Buses were set in the fictional town of Luxton.\n\nAt the beginning of the seventh series Arthur, who is not seen, has left Olive and they are divorced. Olive again gets a job as a clippie on the buses as they are short of money. Stan takes a job in the north of England in a car factory in the \"Goodbye Stan\" episode, and the Inspector takes Stan's old room as a lodger.\n\nIn addition, two five-minute Christmas specials were made by LWT as part of an ''All Star Comedy Carnival'' in 1969 and 1972, ITV's answer to the BBC's ''[[Christmas Night with the Stars]]'' programme. The 1969 edition has been lost, but the 1972 edition \u2013 featuring a goose that the cast are chasing for Christmas dinner \u2013 exists in the [[Thames Television]] archive, which is now owned by [[FremantleMedia]]. A spin-off series, ''[[Don't Drink the Water (TV series)|Don't Drink the Water]]'' (1974\u201375), ran for thirteen episodes, featuring Blake retiring to Spain with his sister Dorothy ([[Pat Coombs]]).\n\nReg Varney undertook a [[Passenger Carrying Vehicle|PCV]] driving test in order to be filmed driving the bus for the exterior scenes.\n\nThe earlier series were recorded at [[London Weekend Television]]'s original studios in Wembley (now [[Fountain Studios]]). In late 1972, LWT relocated to new studios on the [[The London Studios|South Bank of the River Thames]]; here the outside doors to the main and secondary studios were too small to accommodate the [[double-decker bus]]es used in the series. Therefore, single decker buses were used and a plywood mock-up of an upper deck was lowered from a [[Stage lighting|lighting rig]].\n\nFilmed external shots were part of the series. LWT arranged with the now defunct [[Eastern National Omnibus Company]] to use its buses at Wood Green bus garage in North London. They were shown as belonging to Luxton and District. Luxton is supposed to be in Essex, and actual Essex towns including Southend-on-Sea, Basildon, Braintree and Tilbury are all mentioned. One of the bus route termini was \"Cemetery Gates\", for which LWT used the entrance to [[Lavender Hill Cemetery]]. A different [[Lavender Hill]] in [[Battersea]] also features in the last episode of the last series, featuring the town hall, now the [[Battersea Arts Centre]].\n\nThe fourth series was affected by the ITV [[Colour Strike|colour strike]], with seven of thirteen episodes being made in black and white.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main article|List of On the Buses episodes}}\n\n==Theme music==\nThe theme music for the series, entitled \"Happy Harry\", was written by Tony Russell.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Walker |first1=Craig |title=The On The Buses Quiz Book |publisher=Andrews UK Limited |year=2012 |isbn=9781909143111 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3q5BAAAQBAJ&pg=PT267&lpg=PT267 |page=267}}</ref>\n\n==Films==\n[[File:Onthebuses.jpg|thumb|right|The series spawned three feature film spin-offs and a stage version]]\nThe three spin-off films were produced by [[Hammer Film Productions]]. They are ''[[On the Buses (film)|On the Buses]]'' (1971), ''[[Mutiny on the Buses]]'' (1972), and ''[[Holiday on the Buses]]'' (1973), set in a holiday camp. ''On the Buses'' became Britain's top box office film of 1971.\n\nThe films were set in a different [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] to the series \u2013 in the films, Arthur and Olive manage to have a child despite their apparently sexless marriage and Arthur's 'operation' \u2013 the exact nature of which was never explicitly revealed. Arthur's operation is mentioned in the first film, but later Olive gives birth to their baby son. The three films follow a loose [[story arc]] which shows their son (Little Arthur) growing up. Olive is pregnant with a second child at the end of ''Mutiny'', but no mention of this was made in the third film, ''Holiday'', set mainly in a [[Holiday_camp|Holiday Camp]]. The bus depot becomes The Town & District Bus Company instead of The Luxton & District Traction Company. The buses in the films are mostly red ones, with one green one (not including the [[Windsor Safari Park]] tour bus in ''Mutiny On The Buses'').\n\n==American adaptation==\nThe format of ''On the Buses'' was sold to America, where it was remade by [[NBC]] as ''[[Lotsa Luck]]'', starring [[Dom DeLuise]] as Stanley Belmont with [[Kathleen Freeman]] as Iris Belmont, his mum, Wynn Irwin as Arthur Swann, [[Beverly Sanders]] as Olive Swann and Jack Knight as Bummy Pfitzer, his best friend. Episodes based on the original ''On The Buses'' scripts were adapted by such American writers as [[Carl Reiner]], [[Bill Persky]] and [[Sam Denoff]]. Inspector Blake did not have a counterpart in the American version; and, in another significant change to the storyline, Stan worked at the lost property office at the bus depot rather than being a driver. After a pilot was made, the sitcom ran for one series of 22 episodes in 1973\u201374. It was not a success, and has never been screened in Britain.\n\n==Critical reception==\nDespite the popularity of ''On the Buses'' with sections of the public, TV reviewers and historians have generally held the show in lower regard.<ref name=\"tgb\">''The Guinness Book of Classic British TV'', by Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping, Second Edition.Guinness Publishing Ltd., 1996 (p.66).</ref> In its section on situation comedies, ''The Guinness Book of Classic British TV'' describes ''On the Buses'' as ITV's \"longest running and most self-consciously unfunny series\".<ref name=\"tgb\" /> TV reviewer [[Victor Lewis-Smith]] later criticised the then head of [[London Weekend Television]], [[Frank Muir]], for [[green-light]]ing the programme, which Lewis-Smith called \"the wretched ''On the Buses''\".<ref>Lewis-Smith, Victor.

However, although a pilot script was written, it wasn't made. ''Back On The Buses'' was to feature Stan Butler, having run his own business for some years and made some money, starting his own bus company in the newly deregulated market, and hiring Jack to work with him. As they attempt to get the company off the ground, they discover a rival company has set up in the town, owned by none other than Blakey. The comedy in the series would have come from the conflict between the two businesses, and how Stan and Jack attempted to battle Blakey's bigger and more professional company.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Home media==\n\n===Region 1===\n[[Visual Entertainment]] released ''On the Buses: The Ultimate Collection'', an eleven-disc box set featuring the complete series on DVD on 12 September 2006.\n\n===Region 2===\n[[Network DVD]] released ''On the Buses: The Complete Series'' box set on DVD on 13 November 2006 for the very first time.
