The name is derived from the castle Medeburu which was first mentioned in 969.\n\nAround 1940 a large housing area was added for workers of the [[Lignite|brown coal]] mining in [[Espenhain]]. Between 1977 and 1980 Magdeborn had to give way to the mining, after all inhabitants (ca. 3200) had been moved from the end of the 1960s.\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons}}\n* [http://www.magdeborn.de/ Magdeborn] private website\n* [http://grosspoesna.de/new/cms/front_content.php?idart=173 Das Projekt Vineta], art based on the former church, [[Gro\u00dfp\u00f6sna]]\n* [http://www.bauplan-potel.de/content/view/22/68/ Das Kunstobjekt \u201eVINETA\u201c nimmt Gestalt an] bauplan-potel.de\n* [http://www.kunst-statt-kohle.de/ Kunst statt Kohle]\n* {{HOV}}\n\n{{coord|51|14|N|12|27|E|display=title|region:DE_type:city_source:GNS-enwiki}}\n\n[[Category:Villages in Saxony]]\n[[Category:Kingdom of Saxony]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdeborn"}
