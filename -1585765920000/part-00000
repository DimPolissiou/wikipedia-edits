{"title_page": "Makholokoe Tribes", "text_new": "{{no footnotes|date=September 2019}}\n\n== Kholokoe Tribe ==\n\n=== Classification ===\nMakgolokoe/Makholokoe/Makgolokwe/Bakholokoe refers to the '''Bakgatla Tribe''' of Morena Khetsi/Kgetsi son for Morena Tabane. The Ba/Ma-kholokoe are found in the Easter Free State (Harrismith, Wetsieshoek, Vrede, Kestel, etc.), Kwazulu/Natal(Nqutu) and Mpumalanga (Daggakraal, Amersfoort) as their historical residence. The Ba/Ma-kholokoe are the descendants of the originally Bantu-Speaking tribes from the central Congo region who migrated Southwards around 600 AD. They are the offspring of Bakgatla Chief Tabane and Mathulare daughter of the Bafokeng Chief. Tabane fathered five sons, Diale, Kgetsi, Kgwadi (Motl\u00f4kwa), Matsibolo/Matsiboho, and Mosia (in order of their birth). Each broke away to form Bapedi, Ba/Ma-kholokwe, Batl\u00f4kwa, Maphuthing and Basia respectively. Ba/Ma-kholokoe demonstrated linguistic and cultural characteristics that distinguished them from other Bantu-speakers of southern Africa, with their language showing a merger of South Sotho and [[Nguni language]]s. Other practices included totemism (Ba/Ma-kholokoe totem is Phuthi - Duiker, some still hold on to the fowl, while others the porcupine), the preferential marriage of paternal cousins, and an architectural style characterized by a round hut with a conical thatch roof. The senior house of Ba/Ma-Kholokoe is the house of Moduli/Molupi, they are the Makholokoe a Letseba \"letseba le letsebilae ke mang, le Mokholoane a shoele a sa le tsebe\". Tabane first son from his senior wife Matlaisane remained with the Bakgatla ba Mot\u0161ha group, after Tabane concurred the Ba-Venda nation he married a Ba-Venda wife and fathered a son called Davhana who fathered Vele. \n\n=== History (Nalane) ===\n \nThe traditions of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolong_tribe Barolong kingdoms] indicate that at some time in the past up until the leadership battles of the 14th Century they were all under the same rule of a line of kings who claimed descent from a common ancestor, Morolong. Following the death of Morolong's 4th generation great- grandson Masilo there was a leadership crisis that resulted in the formation of the Ba-Hurutshe and Ba-Kwena clans. Ba/Ma-kholokoe claim lineage from the Ba-Hurutshe clan and traced their early ancestry to Mokgatla, the founder of the BaKgatla and his 4th generation great grandson Tabane. \n\nAround 1560 Kgetsi/Khetsi(Lekholokoe) son of Tabane married Mabale and fathered Moloi, Moloi married Maleseha and fathered Hlabathe, Hlabathe fathered Sehoala/Sehoele, Sehoala married Malekoesa and fathered Tjale, Tjale fathered Tsholedi, Tsholedi married Malekunya and fathered Motsoane, Motsoane fathered Mokholoane, fathered Matsemela who married Madiale and fathered the five known houses of Kholokoe Leubane, Maphale, Tsele, Motaoane and with Matsholedi fathered Lehasa. \n\nBefore the birth of Kgetsi/Khetsi, his father Tabane with other Bakgatla lived around \"Thaba tsa Mohale\" known today as [[Magaliesberg]], during the 1600s Kgetsi/Khetsi took his group and moved eastwards and North of Lekoa (Vaal) settling near Seratoe today [[Standerton]], at a mountain which since their occupation became Thaba Kholokoe.  This is where Ba/Ma-kholokoe lived for over 200 years, about eight to nine generations until the attacks of Matiwane in 1822, Mzilikazi in 1823 and is considered the birthplace of Ba/Ma-khlokoe. Some of the Ba/Ma-kholokoe Kings/Chief that lived in Thaba Kholokoe:\n- Kgetsi\n- Moloi\n- Hlabate\n- Sehoaba/Sehoele\n- Tyale\n- Tsholedi\n- Motsoane\n- Mokholoane\n- Matsemela\nFrom Thaba Kholokoe Ba/Ma-kholokoe spread to many areas around the Free State and Natal. One group under the leadership of Morena Wetsi (Oetsi) settled in today's Wetsieshoek, where many Ba/Ma-kholokoe were killed inside a [[Witsie's Cave (Lekhalong la Witsie)|cave]] during a war against the Boers. The kinship/chieftaincy of Bakholokoe has always been marked by disagreement and internal feuds, living the legacy for this leadership still in question to this day. \n\nAlthough many consider the totem of Ba/Ma-kholokoe as a [[:nso:Phuti|Phuthi]] (duiker), it is believed that this small antelope led Bakholokoe to safety during a war, there are some that say the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe totem is a porcupine [[Porcupine]].\n\n=== Land (Naha) ===\n \nAlthough one would love to hear the anecdotal side of the Ba-Kholokoe Tribe history, it is unfortunately heavily clouded by the ever-present and festering issue of land and property dispossession and subsequent brutal oppression and painful suffering of the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe, first from the Dutch \u2015Boer\u2016 Government (Volksraad) of the Free State, and subsequently from the British Orange River Colony Administration and even in the modern times, especially under the Bantustan (Native Homelands) system of the nineteen seventy's and the nineteen eighty's, during which period people like the late Qwaqwa Homeland Prime Minister T.K.Mopeli, ruthlessly sought to and nearly achieved destroying the BaKholokoe Tribe! Much of the history written today states that Qwaqwa formerly known as Wetsieshoek was residence to only two Basotho tribes Bakoena and Batlokoa completely ignoring the presence of Ba/Ma-Kholokoe.\n\nLike many other tribes, Bakholokoe were dispossessed of their land leading to their traditional leaders, the Batlokoa traditional leaders and the then secretary of Bakholokoe traditional council  [[Josiah_Tshangana_Gumede|JT Gumede]] going to England in 1906 to protest the Bakhlokoe and Batlokoa losing their ancestral land to the former Boer republics. \n\nAs early as 1837 the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe tribe was already resident in the northern Free State around the Maluti region, Northern Natal around the Klip River region and the Vaal River region, notably the areas of the Witsieshoek district and the Harrismith district. In 1856 the Ba-Kholokoe, under Morena Wetsi, were forcefully dispossessed of this part of their territory by the Free State Dutch Government, on wholly unjustifiable pretenses, only two years after the Convention of Bloemfontein of 1854.\n\nIn 1866 Commandant C. de Villiers, also popularly known as Masoothonyane, who was then in charge of the Thaba Nchu, i.e. Harrismith district, and a member of the Volksraad, requested the tribes to assist the Free State Government in the war against Moshoeshoe. They rendered military service as the Free Burgher Natives, and their armed contingents were known as the \u2015Witlaps\u2016 and the \u2015Ringhals\u2016. The services were rendered firstly in consideration to secure and confirm the Tribes in free possession of the lands they then occupied, and secondly after successful conclusion of that war in 1868, for the payment of 9450 head of cattle to Commandant De Villiers acting for his Government, he agreed to the enlargement of the lands occupied by the Tribes. He, De Villiers actually promised them that the land, approximately 2130 square miles (551 667 hectares) - which the tribes were already occupying, would be secured for them. This is war talk, since in a way he was indirectly saying that this land that they were occupying could at any time be expropriated, if need be by forceful declaration and action, from them. \n\nAt least up to and according to the guarantees of the Proclamation of 1848, no land occupied by these Tribes had been encroached by any Europeans, so De Villiers appeared to be acting in good faith as based on that Proclamation. After the conclusion of the war in 1868, for the payment of 9450 cattle, it was agreed that all the land occupied mainly by two tribes, BaTlokoa and Ba-Kholokoe, who assisted Commandant De Villiers and the Boers in the war against Moshoeshoe, would then be given to them, after it has also been enlarged. There were three payments which were made for the purchase of three different areas of the land: 2450 cattle paid for the Halspruit area, made by the BaTlokoa tribe, 4000 cattle paid for the Klip Rivier area, the land situated in the Vrede and Harrismith Districts, also made by the BaTlokoa tribe, and 3000 cattle paid for the Mill River Valley in the Harrismith district, made by the Ba-Kholokoe tribe. The payments for the land of the Ba-Tlokoa tribe were made by Morena Lesisa Tsotetsi, who was representing heirs of Morena Letika and Morena Lesala, both who were the late Marena (Chiefs) of the Ba-Tlokoa tribe. He paid the combined 6450 cattle for both the Halspruit and Klip Rivier areas, which were largely occupied by the Ba-Tlokoa tribe. The Halspruit area was home to the Ba-Tlokoa tribe under the late Morena Lesala, and the Klip Rivier area was under the late Morena Letika, both of whom were now represented by Morena Lesisa. The payment for the Mill River Valley land, which covered both Thabantsu and Witsieshoek districts of the Ba-Kholokoe Tribe was made by Morena Letlatsa Moloi, who was representing heirs of the Late Morena Hlomise, son of the late Morena Oetsi (\u2015Witsie\u2016) of the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe. However, in 1888 the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe, after having received notice to leave the land, were forcibly evicted without any compensation. The struggle to regain their land had begun. \n\nChief Letlatsa Moloi of the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe became a thorn in the flesh for Captain John Quayle Dickson, the Advisor for Native Affairs in the British Colonial Orange Free State government. On the 5th of September 1903, Captain John Quayle Dickson wrote to Sir Harry Smith from his office in Bloemfontein indicating that he had visited Thabantsu (Harrismith) where he and the Regional Magistrate of the Thaba Nchu territory had personally met and informed Paramount Chief Letlasa of the Ba-Kholokoe Tribe that from then onwards he would be granted no special privileges whatsoever, and that he was now stripped of his position as one of the well-known and respected Morena oa Ba-Kholokoe, declaring him to be \u2015just another Native\u2016, and therefore from then in his opinion Paramount Chief Letlatsa will give no further trouble. Yet more trouble from the cheated and dispossessed tribes was coming! The boundaries of these areas were well defined as verified at the inquiry held in Harrismith by Captain John Quayle Dickson, Advisor for Native affairs, and Magistrate Leary, as reported in Captain Dickson's letter of 23rd June 1906. A Mr. F Van Reenen also testified to the fact that Commander De Villiers had cheated these native Chiefs in dealing with them, and when this was brought to the knowledge of the Free State government, it forced his resignation from the Volksraad.\n\n=== Battles fought by Ba/Ma-Kholokoe ===\n\nSome of the history states that Ba/Ma-Kholokoe were not great warriors but according to the battles fought, won and lost the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe were as good warriors as any other tribe that lived in that era. Many Battles were fought at Thaba Kholokoe, with Mzilikazi have attacked Ba/Ma-Kholokoe a number of times.\n\nIn 1821 the [https://www.wdl.org/en/item/3269/view/1/231/ battle between (Mahlapo) of Chief Mofeli and Ba/Ma-Kholokoe] under Chief Polane saw Polane and his Son Selotolotsa Killed, alongside many others and their cattle were taken.\n\n[http://wiredspace.wits.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10539/9701/Appendix%201-11.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y In 1856/7 the battle of Ba/Ma-Kholokoe under Chief Wetsi/Oetsi] and the Boers saw many Ba/Makholokoe killed in the cave while Wetsi managed to escape to Lesotho.\n\n=== Genealogical tree of Ba/Ma-kholokoe ===\n\n[[File:New Makholokoe (2).png|thumb|Updated family tree]]\n[[File:Genealogy Bakgatla.jpg|thumb|Genealogy of Bakgatla from Morolong]]\n\n=== Some of the notable Ba/Ma-kholokoe ===\n\n* [[Precious_Moloi-Motsepe|Dr Precious Moloi Motsepe]]\n* [[Teboho Moloi]]\n* Dr Matholela Lucas Moloi\n* Pabi Moloi\n* [[Timothy Moloi]]\n* Nchakha Moloi\n* Vusi Moloi\n* Godfrey Moloi\n* Lehasa Moloi\n* [[Lerato Moloi]]\n* Onicca Moloi\n* Nana Moloi\n* [[Thabo Moloi]]\n=== Sources ===\n\n* DIE MAKHOLOKOE STAMHOOFDE, DIE GEKOSE STAMHOOF \u2013\nLETSITSA (II) \u2013 MOJALEFA OA BORENA BA MAKHOLOKOE\u2016, as\nrecorded in 1429 by the QWAQWA PRINTERS.

The Ba/Ma-kholokoe are found in the Easter Free State (Harrismith, Wetsieshoek, Vrede, Kestel, etc.), Kwazulu/Natal(Nqutu) and Mpumalanga (Daggakraal, Amersfoort) as their historical residence. The Ba/Ma-kholokoe are the descendants of the originally Bantu-Speaking tribes from the central Congo region who migrated Southwards around 600 AD. They are the offspring of Bakgatla Chief Tabane and Mathulare daughter of the Bafokeng Chief. Tabane fathered five sons, Diale, Kgetsi, Kgwadi (Motl\u00f4kwa), Matsibolo/Matsiboho, and Mosia (in order of their birth). Each broke away to form Bapedi, Ba/Ma-kholokwe, Batl\u00f4kwa, Maphuthing and Basia respectively. Ba/Ma-kholokoe demonstrated linguistic and cultural characteristics that distinguished them from other Bantu-speakers of southern Africa, with their language showing a merger of South Sotho and [[Nguni language]]s. Other practices included totemism (Ba/Ma-kholokoe totem is Phuthi - Duiker, some still hold on to the fowl, while others the porcupine), the preferential marriage of paternal cousins, and an architectural style characterized by a round hut with a conical thatch roof. The senior house of Ba/Ma-Kholokoe is the house of Moduli/Molupi, they are the Makholokoe a Letseba \"letseba le letsebilae ke mang, le Mokholoane a shoele a sa le tsebe\". Tabane first son from his senior wife Matlaisane remained with the Bakgatla ba Mot\u0161ha group, after Tabane concurred the Ba-Venda nation he married a Ba-Venda wife and fathered a son called Davhana who fathered Vele. \n\n=== History (Nalane) ===\n \nThe traditions of the Barolong kingdoms indicate that at some time in the past up until the leadership battles of the 14th Century they were all under the same rule of a line of kings who claimed descent from a common ancestor, Morolong. Following the death of Morolong's 4th generation great- grandson Masilo there was a leadership crisis that resulted in the formation of the Ba-Hurutshe and Ba-Kwena clans. Ba/Ma-kholokoe claim lineage from the Ba-Hurutshe clan and traced their early ancestry to Mokgatla, the founder of the BaKgatla and his 4th generation great grandson Tabane. \n\nAround 1560 Kgetsi/Khetsi(Lekholokoe) son of Tabane married Mabale and fathered Moloi, Moloi married Maleseha and fathered Hlabathe, Hlabathe fathered Sehoala/Sehoele, Sehoala married Malekoesa and fathered Tjale, Tjale fathered Tsholedi, Tsholedi married Malekunya and fathered Motsoane, Motsoane fathered Mokholoane, fathered Matsemela who married Madiale and fathered the five known houses of Kholokoe Leubane, Maphale, Tsele, Motaoane and with Matsholedi fathered Lehasa. \n\nBefore the birth of Kgetsi/Khetsi, his father Tabane with other Bakgatla lived around \"Thaba tsa Mohale\" known today as [[Magaliesberg]], during the 1600s Kgetsi/Khetsi took his group and moved eastwards and North of Lekoa (Vaal) settling near Seratoe today [[Standerton]], at a mountain which since their occupation became Thaba Kholokoe.  This is where Ba/Ma-kholokoe lived for over 200 years, about eight to nine generations until the attacks of Matiwane in 1822, Mzilikazi in 1823 and is considered the birthplace of Ba/Ma-khlokoe. Some of the Ba/Ma-kholokoe Kings/Chief that lived in Thaba Kholokoe:\n- Kgetsi\n- Moloi\n- Hlabate\n- Sehoaba/Sehoele\n- Tyale\n- Tsholedi\n- Motsoane\n- Mokholoane\n- Matsemela\nFrom Thaba Kholokoe Ba/Ma-kholokoe spread to many areas around the Free State and Natal. One group under the leadership of Morena Wetsi (Oetsi) settled in today's Wetsieshoek, where many Ba/Ma-kholokoe were killed inside a [[Witsie's Cave (Lekhalong la Witsie)|cave]] during a war against the Boers. The kinship/chieftaincy of Bakholokoe has always been marked by disagreement and internal feuds, living the legacy for this leadership still in question to this day. \n\nAlthough many consider the totem of Ba/Ma-kholokoe as a [[:nso:Phuti|Phuthi]] (duiker), it is believed that this small antelope led Bakholokoe to safety during a war, there are some that say the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe totem is a porcupine [[Porcupine]].\n\n=== Land (Naha) ===\n \nAlthough one would love to hear the anecdotal side of the Ba-Kholokoe Tribe history, it is unfortunately heavily clouded by the ever-present and festering issue of land and property dispossession and subsequent brutal oppression and painful suffering of the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe, first from the Dutch \u2015Boer\u2016 Government (Volksraad) of the Free State, and subsequently from the British Orange River Colony Administration and even in the modern times, especially under the Bantustan (Native Homelands) system of the nineteen seventy's and the nineteen eighty's, during which period people like the late Qwaqwa Homeland Prime Minister T.K.Mopeli, ruthlessly sought to and nearly achieved destroying the BaKholokoe Tribe! Much of the history written today states that Qwaqwa formerly known as Wetsieshoek was residence to only two Basotho tribes Bakoena and Batlokoa completely ignoring the presence of Ba/Ma-Kholokoe.\n\nLike many other tribes, Bakholokoe were dispossessed of their land leading to their traditional leaders, the Batlokoa traditional leaders and the then secretary of Bakholokoe traditional council  [[Josiah_Tshangana_Gumede|JT Gumede]] going to England in 1906 to protest the Bakhlokoe and Batlokoa losing their ancestral land to the former Boer republics. \n\nAs early as 1837 the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe tribe was already resident in the northern Free State around the Maluti region, Northern Natal around the Klip River region and the Vaal River region, notably the areas of the Witsieshoek district and the Harrismith district. In 1856 the Ba-Kholokoe, under Morena Wetsi, were forcefully dispossessed of this part of their territory by the Free State Dutch Government, on wholly unjustifiable pretenses, only two years after the Convention of Bloemfontein of 1854.\n\nIn 1866 Commandant C. de Villiers, also popularly known as Masoothonyane, who was then in charge of the Thaba Nchu, i.e. Harrismith district, and a member of the Volksraad, requested the tribes to assist the Free State Government in the war against Moshoeshoe. They rendered military service as the Free Burgher Natives, and their armed contingents were known as the \u2015Witlaps\u2016 and the \u2015Ringhals\u2016. The services were rendered firstly in consideration to secure and confirm the Tribes in free possession of the lands they then occupied, and secondly after successful conclusion of that war in 1868, for the payment of 9450 head of cattle to Commandant De Villiers acting for his Government, he agreed to the enlargement of the lands occupied by the Tribes. He, De Villiers actually promised them that the land, approximately 2130 square miles (551 667 hectares) - which the tribes were already occupying, would be secured for them. This is war talk, since in a way he was indirectly saying that this land that they were occupying could at any time be expropriated, if need be by forceful declaration and action, from them. \n\nAt least up to and according to the guarantees of the Proclamation of 1848, no land occupied by these Tribes had been encroached by any Europeans, so De Villiers appeared to be acting in good faith as based on that Proclamation. After the conclusion of the war in 1868, for the payment of 9450 cattle, it was agreed that all the land occupied mainly by two tribes, BaTlokoa and Ba-Kholokoe, who assisted Commandant De Villiers and the Boers in the war against Moshoeshoe, would then be given to them, after it has also been enlarged. There were three payments which were made for the purchase of three different areas of the land: 2450 cattle paid for the Halspruit area, made by the BaTlokoa tribe, 4000 cattle paid for the Klip Rivier area, the land situated in the Vrede and Harrismith Districts, also made by the BaTlokoa tribe, and 3000 cattle paid for the Mill River Valley in the Harrismith district, made by the Ba-Kholokoe tribe. The payments for the land of the Ba-Tlokoa tribe were made by Morena Lesisa Tsotetsi, who was representing heirs of Morena Letika and Morena Lesala, both who were the late Marena (Chiefs) of the Ba-Tlokoa tribe. He paid the combined 6450 cattle for both the Halspruit and Klip Rivier areas, which were largely occupied by the Ba-Tlokoa tribe. The Halspruit area was home to the Ba-Tlokoa tribe under the late Morena Lesala, and the Klip Rivier area was under the late Morena Letika, both of whom were now represented by Morena Lesisa. The payment for the Mill River Valley land, which covered both Thabantsu and Witsieshoek districts of the Ba-Kholokoe Tribe was made by Morena Letlatsa Moloi, who was representing heirs of the Late Morena Hlomise, son of the late Morena Oetsi (\u2015Witsie\u2016) of the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe. However, in 1888 the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe, after having received notice to leave the land, were forcibly evicted without any compensation. The struggle to regain their land had begun. \n\nChief Letlatsa Moloi of the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe became a thorn in the flesh for Captain John Quayle Dickson, the Advisor for Native Affairs in the British Colonial Orange Free State government. On the 5th of September 1903, Captain John Quayle Dickson wrote to Sir Harry Smith from his office in Bloemfontein indicating that he had visited Thabantsu (Harrismith) where he and the Regional Magistrate of the Thaba Nchu territory had personally met and informed Paramount Chief Letlasa of the Ba-Kholokoe Tribe that from then onwards he would be granted no special privileges whatsoever, and that he was now stripped of his position as one of the well-known and respected Morena oa Ba-Kholokoe, declaring him to be \u2015just another Native\u2016, and therefore from then in his opinion Paramount Chief Letlatsa will give no further trouble. Yet more trouble from the cheated and dispossessed tribes was coming!
