Production is alternate-bearing or [[biennial plant|biennial]]-bearing, meaning the harvest is heavier in alternate years. Peak production is reached around 20 years. Trees are usually pruned to size to make the harvest easier. One male tree produces enough pollen for eight to twelve drupe-bearing females. Harvesting in the United States and in Greece is often accomplished using equipment to shake the drupes off the tree. After hulling and drying, pistachios are sorted according to open-mouth and closed-mouth shells, then roasted or processed by special machines to produce pistachio kernels.\n\nIn California, almost all female pistachio trees are the [[cultivar]] '[[Kerman#Economy|Kerman]]'.

Aflatoxins are potent [[carcinogen]]ic chemicals produced by molds such as ''[[Aspergillus flavus]]'' and ''[[Aspergillus parasiticus]]''. The mold contamination may occur from soil, poor storage, and spread by pests. High levels of mold growth typically appear as gray to black filament-like growth. It is unsafe to eat mold-infected and aflatoxin-contaminated pistachios.<ref name=fao1998>{{cite web|title=Prevention of aflatoxin in pistachios|author=E.

The hull protects the kernel from invasion by molds and insects, but this hull protection can be damaged in the orchard by poor orchard management practices, by birds, or after harvest, which makes it much easier for pistachios to be exposed to contamination. Some pistachios undergo so-called \"early split\", wherein both the hull and the shell split. Damage or early splits can lead to aflatoxin contamination.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Doster and Michailides|title=Aspergillus Moulds and Aflatoxins in Pistachio Nuts in California|journal= Phytopathology|volume= 84|issue=6|pages=583\u2013590|year= 1994|doi=10.1094/phyto-84-583}}</ref> In some cases, a harvest may be treated to keep contamination below strict food safety thresholds; in other cases, an entire batch of pistachios must be destroyed because of aflatoxin contamination.\n\nLike other members of the family Anacardiaceae (which includes [[poison ivy]], [[sumac]], [[mango]], and [[cashew]]), pistachios contain [[urushiol]], an irritant that can cause [[allergy|allergic reactions]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Mabberley |first=D.

Production is alternate-bearing or [[biennial plant|biennial]]-bearing, meaning the harvest is heavier in alternate years. Peak production is reached around 20 years. Trees are usually pruned to size to make the harvest easier. One male tree produces enough pollen for eight to twelve drupe-bearing females. Harvesting in the United States and in Greece is often accomplished using equipment to shake the drupes off the tree. After hulling and drying, pistachios are sorted according to open-mouth and closed-mouth shells, then roasted or processed by special machines to produce pistachio kernels.\n\nIn California, almost all female pistachio trees are the [[cultivar]] '[[Kerman#Economy|Kerman]]'.

Aflatoxins are potent [[carcinogen]]ic chemicals produced by molds such as ''[[Aspergillus flavus]]'' and ''[[Aspergillus parasiticus]]''. The mold contamination may occur from soil, poor storage, and spread by pests. High levels of mold growth typically appear as gray to black filament-like growth.

The hull protects the kernel from invasion by molds and insects, but this hull protection can be damaged in the orchard by poor orchard management practices, by birds, or after harvest, which makes it much easier for pistachios to be exposed to contamination. Some pistachios undergo so-called \"early split\", wherein both the hull and the shell split. Damage or early splits can lead to aflatoxin contamination.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Doster and Michailides|title=Aspergillus Moulds and Aflatoxins in Pistachio Nuts in California|journal= Phytopathology|volume= 84|issue=6|pages=583\u2013590|year= 1994|doi=10.1094/phyto-84-583}}</ref> In some cases, a harvest may be treated to keep contamination below strict food safety thresholds; in other cases, an entire batch of pistachios must be destroyed because of aflatoxin contamination.\n\nLike other members of the family Anacardiaceae (which includes [[poison ivy]], [[sumac]], [[mango]], and [[cashew]]), pistachios contain [[urushiol]], an irritant that can cause [[allergy|allergic reactions]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Mabberley |first=D.

The season is notable for the resignation of [[Ruud Gullit]] early in the season, with [[Bobby Robson]] replacing him as manager.\n\n==Season summary==\nFour defeats from Newcastle's first five Premiership fixtures prompted the resignation of manager [[Ruud Gullit]] after one year in charge.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/news/432333.stm | work=BBC News | title=Gullit quits Newcastle | date=28 August 1999}}</ref> He had fallen out with [[Alan Shearer]]<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/news/432400.stm | work=BBC News | title=Fans blame Shearer rift for resignation | date=28 August 1999}}</ref> and dropped the striker, who was absent in an embarrassing 2-1 loss to arch-rivals [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-gullit-sunk-by-shearer-gamble-1118294.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Phil | last=Shaw | title=Football: Gullit sunk by Shearer gamble | date=30 August 1999}}</ref>\n\nVeteran ex-England manager and self-confessed [[Geordie]], [[Bobby Robson]] was brought in to replace Gullit - making Robson, at 66, the oldest manager in the league.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/436390.stm | work=BBC News | title=Robson takes Newcastle hotseat | date=3 September 1999}}</ref> His first home game in charge was particularly memorable and impressive: an 8\u20130 victory over [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], which remains the club's record Premier League home win.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/fa_carling_premiership/451554.stm|title=Shearer's five star day |date=19 September 1999|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Sir Bobby : Ten Facts|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/tyne/sport/2005/02/28/bobby_facts.shtml|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=8 July 2007}}</ref> Striker [[Alan Shearer]] scored five of the goals in that game.\n\nRobson ensured Newcastle's survival in the Premiership. This was achieved with stylish attacking football and with Lee and Shearer back onside. Robson consolidated a fading Newcastle side, and they finished a secure 11th in the final table. More impressively, they were the division's third-highest scoring team with 63 goals from 38 games.\n\n===Image gallery===\n<gallery>\nFile:Ruud Gullit 2012.jpg|{{flagicon|NED}} [[Ruud Gullit]]

However, long-term students of the Course claim that such comments indicate that the writers have not studied, let alone understood, the book\u2019s content. According to Olav Hammer, the psychiatrist and bestselling author [[Gerald G. Jampolsky]] has been among the most effective promoters of the Course. His first book ''Love is Letting go of Fear'', which is based on the principles of the Course, was published in 1979 and after being endorsed on [[Johnny Carson]]'s show went on to sell over 3 million copies by 1990.<ref>Hammer, O, 2004, ''Claiming Knowledge : Strategies of Epistemology from Theosophy to the New Age'', Studies in the history of religions 90, Brill, Leiden, Boston p451</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n''A Course in Miracles'' was written as a collaborative venture between Schucman and William ('Bill') Thetford. In 1958 Schucman began her professional career at [[Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center]] in New York City as Thetford's research associate.<ref>[https://acim.org/Scribing/about_scribes.html Helen Schucman's Career]</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://acim.biz/a-course-in-miracles-book-acim/|title=A Course in Miracles Book ACIM Lessons Online and Text|work=ACIM Portal|access-date=25 December 2017}}</ref> In the spring of 1965, at a time when their weekly office meetings had become so contentious that they both dreaded them, Thetford suggested to Schucman that \"[t]here must be another way\".<ref name=\"Collaboration\">{{cite book | title=Helen Schucman: Autobiography, in \"Origins of A Course in Miracles\" 3:27\u201328 |publisher=Foundation for Inner Peace Archives, Tiburon, CA)}}</ref> Schucman believed that this interaction acted as a stimulus, triggering a series of inner experiences that were understood by her as visions, dreams, and heightened imagery, along with an \"inner voice\" which she identified as Jesus. She said that on October 21, 1965, an \"inner voice\" told her: \"This is a Course in Miracles, please take notes.\" Schucman said that the writing made her very uncomfortable, though it never seriously occurred to her to stop.<ref>Skutch, Robert. ''Journey Without Distance: The Story Behind A Course in Miracles''. [[Ten Speed Press]], Berkeley, CA, 1984, p. 58.</ref> The next day, she explained the events of her \"note taking\" to Thetford. To her surprise, Thetford encouraged her to continue the process. He also offered to assist her in typing out her notes as she read them to him. The transcription the next day repeated itself regularly for many years to come. In 1972, the dictation of the three main sections of the Course was completed, with some additional minor dictation coming after that point.<ref>[http://www.miraclestudies.net/Scribe.html Final Dictation of The Song of Prayer]</ref>\n\n[[Image:Ken wapnick seattle unity cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Kenneth Wapnick helped edit the book and founded the Foundation for A Course in Miracles]]\n\nFr. [[Benedict Groeschel]], a Roman Catholic priest who had studied under Thetford and worked with Schucman, introduced Kenneth Wapnick to Schucman and Thetford in November 1972. Groeschel was given a copy of the ''ACIM'' manuscript in 1973 and was instructed by Schucman not to distribute the manuscript; however, with Schucman's permission, he made it available to Wapnick. Wapnick reviewed the draft and discussed with Schucman and Thetford, further revisions that he felt were needed in order to publish the book. Thetford made a few further editorial decisions about the \"Principles of Miracles\" section, and soon afterwards opted to withdraw from direct involvement. Wapnick and Schucman deleted personal material apparently directed only to Schucman and Thetford, created chapter and section headings, and corrected various inconsistencies in paragraph structure, punctuation, and capitalization.<ref name=\"The Story of A Course In Miracles\">{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpJ6BO8xeDA |title= The Story of A Course in Miracles = Documentary where Bill Thetford, Helen Schucman, and Ken Wapnick talk about A Course in Miracles  |accessdate=21 February 2011}}</ref> The editing process was completed by February 1975. Wapnick subsequently became a teacher of ''ACIM,'' a co-founder and president of the Foundation for A Course in Miracles (FACIM), and a director and executive committee member of the Foundation for Inner Peace (FIP). \n==Contents==\nThe content of ''A Course in Miracles'' is presented in the three sections: \"Textbook\", \"Workbook\", and \"Manual for Teachers\":\n* The \"Textbook\" presents a thought system about truth and illusion on two levels:\n**It states that  ''everything'' involving time, space, and [[perception]] is illusory. It presents a monism which states that God is the only truth and reality: perfect, unchanging, unchangeable, extending only love, though not in time and space, which cannot really be comprehended from a dualistic perspective. The theory further states that all life as we perceive it is actually one life (because God has only one son, sometimes called the collective sonship), dreaming of separation and fragmentation. It claims that  eternity is outside time and space and that this dream never occurred in reality and is \"already over\", though not the (illusory) perception. When addressing the question of how such an illusory dream could arise from a perfect and unchanging God, the Course states that to ask that question is to presume that the time-space dream is real, which it states is not. ''A Course in Miracles'' states that to think we exist as individuals is the fundamental error. However, since we experience ourselves in time and space, reading these pages, the course presents its thought system on a second level:\n** The time-space level, or \"perceptory\" level, which is referred to as \"the dream\". ''A Course in Miracles'' states that this level was \"made\" by the \"sleeping Son\" as an attack on God. Furthermore, the \"Son\" is regarded as not just Jesus, but as all collective life. In this time-space dream, perception is continuously fueled by what it originated from: separation, judgment, and attack. This results in what the Course calls the \"sin-guilt-fear\" cycle: we ''sinned'' by rejecting God and making a universe of time-space (the [[Big Bang]]); this results in ''guilt'' over our rejection of our Creator, and subsequent ''fear'' of God's wrath. The \"sin-guilt-fear\" is described as too horrendous to face, and therefore subsequently [[Psychological projection|projected]] out, so that to ''Homo sapiens'' it seems that evil is everywhere except in himself. The world becomes a threatening place, in which we are born only to fear, fight, and die. The thought that keeps this process going is referred to as \"[[Ego (religion)|ego]]\", or \"the wrong mind\". ''A Course in Miracles'' concludes that happiness cannot be found in earthly time-space life, and urges the reader not to commit suicide but rather to make a fundamental mind shift from \"condemnation-out-of-fear\" (mindlessness) to \"forgiveness-out-of-love\" ([[mindfulness]]), since our \"right mind\" is outside time-space and cannot be harmed by worldly attacks. According to the course, seeing \"the Face of Christ\" in all living things is the way to \"accept the Atonement\" and ultimately awaken from the dream and return to the eternity of God. Ultimately, this means the end of [[individuality]] and of the ego. In this respect, there are parallels with the Indian concept of [[karma]] and the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', which Helen Schucman reports that she was not familiar with, although William Thetford was. The basic philosophy of the Course could be described as [[Vedanta]] in Christian dress and can be seen in the same tradition as other Eastern-influenced American religious and philosophical thought such as that of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Mary Baker Eddy]] and [[Joel S. Goldsmith]].\n* The \"Workbook\" presents 365 lessons, one for each day of the year, which claim to recondition the student's mind from \"condemnation-out-of-fear\" to \"forgiveness-out-of-love\". ''A Course in Miracles'' defines \"miracle\" as the conscious choice to make that mind shift, including its non-observable effects on the minds of others.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The workbook lessons attempt to train the reader to see oneness in all living things for a steadily increasing time of the day. The lessons aim at convincing by experience. The core message of the workbook is that, to forgive oneself completely, a person must (a) forgive all living things, and (b) do this by instruction of the Holy Spirit (i.e., the \"Voice for God,\" \"right mind,\" \"Inner Teacher,\" or \"intuition\"). At the end, after one year, the workbook states that it is \"a beginning, not an end\".{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n* The \"Manual for Teachers\" is a collection of questions and answers. It aims at motivating the reader to become a \"teacher of God\": a human being living in time and space, but at the same time seeing oneness in everything, having let go of all individual and separate interests, and being fully guided by the \"voice\" of the Holy Spirit.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n* In the third edition, the two pamphlets \"Psychotherapy\" and \"The Song of Prayer\" were added. They elaborate on the parallels with current psychotherapy and on the meaning of prayer, respectively.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n== Foundation for Inner Peace and other editions ==\nA limited edition release of 300 copies of the first three sections of the book was published by The Foundation for Inner Peace, which had been created solely to publish ''A Course in Miracles''. In June 1976, FIP published the first three sections of ''ACIM'' as three hardcover volumes in a 5,000 copy run, along with the publication of the supplemental booklet ''Psychology: Purpose, Process, Practice.'' In 1985, FIP began publishing a single soft-cover volume containing all three sections. In 1992, FIP published a second, hardcover edition. This revision added some editorial content and a verse-numbering system, as well as a \"Clarification of Terms\" section. At this time, FIP also published the supplemental ''Song of Prayer'' booklet.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn October 2004, a long-standing copyright battle over ''A Course In Miracles'' ended with a ruling that put the work into the [[public domain]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn January 2006, Course in Miracles Society, a non-profit established in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], published ''A Course in Miracles-Original Edition'' (ACIM OE), which is the 1972 manuscript as completed by Helen Schucman and Bill Thetford.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn August 2017, the Circle of Atonement published ''A Course in Miracles: Complete and Annotated Edition'', which contains the original material that Helen Schucman wrote up to 1972, prior to the Foundation for Inner Peace edition.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Reception==\nSince it went on sale in 1976, the text has been translated into 22 languages.<ref name=\"translations\">{{cite web | url = http://www.acim.org |title=ACIM Translations |publisher=Foundation for Inner Peace |accessdate=28 September 2009}}</ref> The book is distributed globally, spawning a range of organized groups.<ref>Bradby, Ruth, \"A course in miracles in Ireland\". 147 \u2013 162 in Olivia Cosgrove et al.

Jampolsky]] has been among the most effective promoters of the Course.

In 1958 Schucman began her professional career at [[Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center]] in New York City as Thetford's research associate.<ref>[https://acim.org/Scribing/about_scribes.html Helen Schucman's Career]</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://acim.biz/a-course-in-miracles-book-acim/|title=A Course in Miracles Book ACIM Lessons Online and Text|work=ACIM Portal|access-date=25 December 2017}}</ref> In the spring of 1965, at a time when their weekly office meetings had become so contentious that they both dreaded them, Thetford suggested to Schucman that \"[t]here must be another way\".<ref name=\"Collaboration\">{{cite book | title=Helen Schucman: Autobiography, in \"Origins of A Course in Miracles\" 3:27\u201328 |publisher=Foundation for Inner Peace Archives, Tiburon, CA)}}</ref> Schucman believed that this interaction acted as a stimulus, triggering a series of inner experiences that were understood by her as visions, dreams, and heightened imagery, along with an \"inner voice\" which she identified as Jesus. She said that on October 21, 1965, an \"inner voice\" told her: \"This is a Course in Miracles, please take notes.\" Schucman said that the writing made her very uncomfortable, though it never seriously occurred to her to stop.<ref>Skutch, Robert. ''Journey Without Distance: The Story Behind A Course in Miracles''. [[Ten Speed Press]], Berkeley, CA, 1984, p. 58.</ref> The next day, she explained the events of her \"note taking\" to Thetford. To her surprise, Thetford encouraged her to continue the process. He also offered to assist her in typing out her notes as she read them to him. The transcription the next day repeated itself regularly for many years to come. In 1972, the dictation of the three main sections of the Course was completed, with some additional minor dictation coming after that point.<ref>[http://www.miraclestudies.net/Scribe.html Final Dictation of The Song of Prayer]</ref>\n\n[[Image:Ken wapnick seattle unity cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Kenneth Wapnick helped edit the book and founded the Foundation for A Course in Miracles]]\n\nFr. [[Benedict Groeschel]], a Roman Catholic priest who had studied under Thetford and worked with Schucman, introduced Kenneth Wapnick to Schucman and Thetford in November 1972. Groeschel was given a copy of the ''ACIM'' manuscript in 1973 and was instructed by Schucman not to distribute the manuscript; however, with Schucman's permission, he made it available to Wapnick. Wapnick reviewed the draft and discussed with Schucman and Thetford, further revisions that he felt were needed in order to publish the book. Thetford made a few further editorial decisions about the \"Principles of Miracles\" section, and soon afterwards opted to withdraw from direct involvement. Wapnick and Schucman deleted personal material apparently directed only to Schucman and Thetford, created chapter and section headings, and corrected various inconsistencies in paragraph structure, punctuation, and capitalization.<ref name=\"The Story of A Course In Miracles\">{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpJ6BO8xeDA |title= The Story of A Course in Miracles = Documentary where Bill Thetford, Helen Schucman, and Ken Wapnick talk about A Course in Miracles  |accessdate=21 February 2011}}</ref> The editing process was completed by February 1975. Wapnick subsequently became a teacher of ''ACIM,'' a co-founder and president of the Foundation for A Course in Miracles (FACIM), and a director and executive committee member of the Foundation for Inner Peace (FIP). \n==Contents==\nThe content of ''A Course in Miracles'' is presented in the three sections: \"Textbook\", \"Workbook\", and \"Manual for Teachers\":\n* The \"Textbook\" presents a thought system about truth and illusion on two levels:\n**It states that  ''everything'' involving time, space, and [[perception]] is illusory. It presents a monism which states that God is the only truth and reality: perfect, unchanging, unchangeable, extending only love, though not in time and space, which cannot really be comprehended from a dualistic perspective. The theory further states that all life as we perceive it is actually one life (because God has only one son, sometimes called the collective sonship), dreaming of separation and fragmentation. It claims that  eternity is outside time and space and that this dream never occurred in reality and is \"already over\", though not the (illusory) perception. When addressing the question of how such an illusory dream could arise from a perfect and unchanging God, the Course states that to ask that question is to presume that the time-space dream is real, which it states is not. ''A Course in Miracles'' states that to think we exist as individuals is the fundamental error. However, since we experience ourselves in time and space, reading these pages, the course presents its thought system on a second level:\n** The time-space level, or \"perceptory\" level, which is referred to as \"the dream\". ''A Course in Miracles'' states that this level was \"made\" by the \"sleeping Son\" as an attack on God. Furthermore, the \"Son\" is regarded as not just Jesus, but as all collective life. In this time-space dream, perception is continuously fueled by what it originated from: separation, judgment, and attack. This results in what the Course calls the \"sin-guilt-fear\" cycle: we ''sinned'' by rejecting God and making a universe of time-space (the [[Big Bang]]); this results in ''guilt'' over our rejection of our Creator, and subsequent ''fear'' of God's wrath. The \"sin-guilt-fear\" is described as too horrendous to face, and therefore subsequently [[Psychological projection|projected]] out, so that to ''Homo sapiens'' it seems that evil is everywhere except in himself. The world becomes a threatening place, in which we are born only to fear, fight, and die. The thought that keeps this process going is referred to as \"[[Ego (religion)|ego]]\", or \"the wrong mind\". ''A Course in Miracles'' concludes that happiness cannot be found in earthly time-space life, and urges the reader not to commit suicide but rather to make a fundamental mind shift from \"condemnation-out-of-fear\" (mindlessness) to \"forgiveness-out-of-love\" ([[mindfulness]]), since our \"right mind\" is outside time-space and cannot be harmed by worldly attacks. According to the course, seeing \"the Face of Christ\" in all living things is the way to \"accept the Atonement\" and ultimately awaken from the dream and return to the eternity of God. Ultimately, this means the end of [[individuality]] and of the ego. In this respect, there are parallels with the Indian concept of [[karma]] and the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', which Helen Schucman reports that she was not familiar with, although William Thetford was. The basic philosophy of the Course could be described as [[Vedanta]] in Christian dress and can be seen in the same tradition as other Eastern-influenced American religious and philosophical thought such as that of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Mary Baker Eddy]] and [[Joel S. Goldsmith]].\n* The \"Workbook\" presents 365 lessons, one for each day of the year, which claim to recondition the student's mind from \"condemnation-out-of-fear\" to \"forgiveness-out-of-love\". ''A Course in Miracles'' defines \"miracle\" as the conscious choice to make that mind shift, including its non-observable effects on the minds of others.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The workbook lessons attempt to train the reader to see oneness in all living things for a steadily increasing time of the day. The lessons aim at convincing by experience. The core message of the workbook is that, to forgive oneself completely, a person must (a) forgive all living things, and (b) do this by instruction of the Holy Spirit (i.e., the \"Voice for God,\" \"right mind,\" \"Inner Teacher,\" or \"intuition\"). At the end, after one year, the workbook states that it is \"a beginning, not an end\".{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n* The \"Manual for Teachers\" is a collection of questions and answers. It aims at motivating the reader to become a \"teacher of God\": a human being living in time and space, but at the same time seeing oneness in everything, having let go of all individual and separate interests, and being fully guided by the \"voice\" of the Holy Spirit.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n* In the third edition, the two pamphlets \"Psychotherapy\" and \"The Song of Prayer\" were added. They elaborate on the parallels with current psychotherapy and on the meaning of prayer, respectively.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n== Foundation for Inner Peace and other editions ==\nA limited edition release of 300 copies of the first three sections of the book was published by The Foundation for Inner Peace, which had been created solely to publish ''A Course in Miracles''. In June 1976, FIP published the first three sections of ''ACIM'' as three hardcover volumes in a 5,000 copy run, along with the publication of the supplemental booklet ''Psychology: Purpose, Process, Practice.'' In 1985, FIP began publishing a single soft-cover volume containing all three sections. In 1992, FIP published a second, hardcover edition. This revision added some editorial content and a verse-numbering system, as well as a \"Clarification of Terms\" section. At this time, FIP also published the supplemental ''Song of Prayer'' booklet.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn October 2004, a long-standing copyright battle over ''A Course In Miracles'' ended with a ruling that put the work into the [[public domain]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn January 2006, Course in Miracles Society, a non-profit established in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], published ''A Course in Miracles-Original Edition'' (ACIM OE), which is the 1972 manuscript as completed by Helen Schucman and Bill Thetford.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn August 2017, the Circle of Atonement published ''A Course in Miracles: Complete and Annotated Edition'', which contains the original material that Helen Schucman wrote up to 1972, prior to the Foundation for Inner Peace edition.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Reception==\nSince it went on sale in 1976, the text has been translated into 22 languages.<ref name=\"translations\">{{cite web | url = http://www.acim.org |title=ACIM Translations |publisher=Foundation for Inner Peace |accessdate=28 September 2009}}</ref> The book is distributed globally, spawning a range of organized groups.<ref>Bradby, Ruth, \"A course in miracles in Ireland\". 147 \u2013 162 in Olivia Cosgrove et al.

It is measured by the [[coefficient of relationship]]. Below, when discussing the coefficient of relationship, we assume the subject and the relative are only related through the kinship term. A coefficient of one represents the relationship you have with yourself. Consanguinity decreases by half for every generations of separation from the [[most recent common ancestor]], as there are two parents for each child. When there is more than one common ancestor the consanguinity between each ancestor is added together to get the final result.<ref name=\"GQAG_COR\">{{cite web|url=http://www.genetic-genealogy.co.uk/Toc115570135.html#Single_Cousins|title=Genetic And Quantitative Aspects Of Genealogy \u2013 CALCULATION OF THE COEFFICIENT OF RELATIONSHIP|publisher=Genetic-genealogy.co.uk|accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nBetween first cousins there are two shared ancestors each with four generations of separation, up and down the family tree (<math>\\left ( \\tfrac{1}{2} \\right )^4 + \\left ( \\tfrac{1}{2} \\right )^4</math>), therefore their consanguinity is one-eighth. When the removal of the cousins relationship increases consanguinity is reduced by half, as the generations of separation increase by one. When the degree of the cousins relationship increases consanguinity is reduced by a quarter, as the generations of separation increase by one on both sides.<ref name=\"GQAG_COR\" />\n\nHalf cousins have half the [[consanguinity]] of ordinary cousins as they have half the common ancestors (i.e. one vs two). Double cousins have twice the [[consanguinity]] of ordinary cousins as they have twice the number of common ancestors (i.e. four vs two). Double first cousins share the same consanguinity as half-siblings. Likewise double half cousins share the same consanguinity as cousins as they both have two common ancestors. If there are half siblings on one side and full siblings on the other they would have three-halves the consanguinity of ordinary first cousins.<ref name=\"GQAG_COR\" />\n\nIn a scenario where two monozygotic (identical) twins mate with another pair of monozygotic twins, the resulting double cousins would test as genetically similar as siblings.\n\n===Reproduction===\nCouples that possess higher than normal [[consanguinity]], shared identical [[DNA]] and [[genetics|genetic]] material, have an increased chance of sharing genes for recessive traits.<ref>[http://theconversation.com/whats-the-genetic-disease-risk-for-children-of-related-couples-7599 The Conversation: What\u2019s the genetic disease risk for children of related couples?] Date: September 27, 2012.

See [[inbreeding]] for more information.\n\nScientists through multiple studies have established a substantial and consistent positive correlation between the kinship of couples and the number of children and grandchildren they have.

It is measured by the [[coefficient of relationship]]. Below, when discussing the coefficient of relationship, we assume the subject and the relative are only related through the kinship term. A coefficient of one represents the relationship you have with yourself. Consanguinity decreases by half for every generations of separation from the [[most recent common ancestor]], as there are two parents for each child.

When the removal of the cousins relationship increases consanguinity is reduced by half, as the generations of separation increase by one. When the degree of the cousins relationship increases consanguinity is reduced by a quarter, as the generations of separation increase by one on both sides.<ref name=\"GQAG_COR\" />\n\nHalf cousins have half the [[consanguinity]] of ordinary cousins as they have half the common ancestors (i.e. one vs two). Double cousins have twice the [[consanguinity]] of ordinary cousins as they have twice the number of common ancestors (i.e. four vs two). Double first cousins share the same consanguinity as half-siblings. Likewise double half cousins share the same consanguinity as cousins as they both have two common ancestors. If there are half siblings on one side and full siblings on the other they would have three-halves the consanguinity of ordinary first cousins.<ref name=\"GQAG_COR\" />\n\nIn a scenario where two monozygotic (identical) twins mate with another pair of monozygotic twins, the resulting double cousins would test as genetically similar as siblings.\n\n===Reproduction===\nCouples that possess higher than normal [[consanguinity]], shared identical [[DNA]] and [[genetics|genetic]] material, have an increased chance of sharing genes for recessive traits.<ref>[http://theconversation.com/whats-the-genetic-disease-risk-for-children-of-related-couples-7599 The Conversation: What\u2019s the genetic disease risk for children of related couples?] Date: September 27, 2012.
