Bhimsen rose to influence after helping the exiled ex-King [[Rana Bahadur Shah]] engineer his return to power in 1804. In gratitude, Rana Bahadur made Bhimsen a ''[[Kaji (Nepal)|Kaji]]'' (equivalent to a minister) of the newly formed government. Rana Bahadur's assassination by his step-brother in 1806 led Bhimsen to massacre ninety-three people, after which he was able to claim the title of the ''[[Mukhtiyar]]'' (equivalent to prime minister). The death of King [[Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah Deva|Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah]] in 1816 at the immature age of 17, with  his heir, King [[Rajendra of Nepal|Rajendra Bikram Shah]] being only 3 years old, along with the support from [[Queen Tripurasundari]] (the junior queen of Rana Bahadur Shah) allowed him to remain in power even after Nepal's defeat in the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]]. After the death of Queen Tripurasundari in 1832 and the adulthood of King [[Rajendra of Nepal|Rajendra]], the conspiracies and infighting with the British envoy [[Brian Houghton Hodgson]], Senior Queen [[Samrajya Laxmi Devi]] and rival courtiers (especially the [[Kala Pandes]], who held Bhimsen Thapa responsible for the death of [[Damodar Pande]] in 1804) finally led to his imprisonment and death by suicide in 1839.\n\nBhimsen's prime ministership is best remembered for the Anglo-Nepalese war. The territorial expanse of the [[Kingdom of Nepal|Gurkha empire]] had reached its greatest extent from [[Sutlej]] river in the west to the [[Teesta River|Teesta]] river in the east. However, Nepal entered into a disastrous Anglo-Nepalese War with the [[East India Company]] lasting from 1814\u201316, which was concluded with the [[Treaty of Sugauli]], by which Nepal lost almost one-third of its land. He is also remembered for bringing about a large number of social, economic, and administrative reforms, as well as the modernization of [[Nepalese Army]] on the template of the [[French Army|French military forces]]. During his lifetime, he commissioned the building of many temples and monuments such as [[Dharahara]] known as ''Bhimsen Stambha'' (\"Bhimsen Tower\").\n\n== Early years ==\n[[File:Nishankalika Flag of Bagale Thapa clan.svg|thumb|upright|Nishankalika flag of [[Bagale Thapa]] clan, Bhimsen's ancestral clan]]\nBhimsen Thapa{{refn|group=note|His given name ''Bhimsen'' is the name of one of the [[Pandava|Pandu princes]] i.e [[Bhimasena]].

At the age of 11, Bhimsen came into contact with the Nepalese Royal Palace when his ''[[Bratabandha]]'' (sacred thread) ceremony was held together with the Crown Prince [[Rana Bahadur Shah]] in Gorkha in 1785.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=13}}{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=23}} In 1798, his father took him to Kathmandu and enrolled him as a bodyguard to the king.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=23}} In Kathmandu, Bhimsen took up residence at Thapathali, after which he lived in [[Bagh Durbar]] near Tundikhel after becoming a ''[[Kaji (Nepal)|Kaji]]'' (equivalent to a minister).{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=23}}\n\n==Rise to power: 1798\u20131804==\n[[File:Rana Bahadur Shah.jpg|thumb|left|King [[Rana Bahadur Shah]], the King of Nepal from 1777 to 1806.]]\n[[File:King Girvan Yuddhavikram Shah (1797-1816) LACMA M.76.129.jpg|left|thumb|King [[Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah]] (1797\u20131816)]]\n\n===Royal household===\nThe premature death of [[Pratap Singh Shah]] (reigned 1775\u201377), the eldest son of [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], left a huge power vacuum that remained unfilled, seriously debilitating the emerging Nepalese state. Pratap Singh Shah's successor was his son, [[Rana Bahadur Shah]] (reigned 1777\u201399), aged two and one-half years at his accession.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=13}} The acting regent until 1785 was [[Queen Rajendra of Nepal|Queen Rajendra Lakshmi]], followed by [[Bahadur Shah of Nepal|Bahadur Shah]] (reigned 1785\u201394), the second son of Prithvi Narayan Shah.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=10}} Court life was consumed by rivalry centered on alignments with these two regents rather than on issues of national administration, and it set a bad precedent for future competition among contending regents. The exigencies of [[Sino-Nepalese War]] in 1788\u201392 had forced Bahadur Shah to temporarily take a pro-British stance, which had led to a commercial treaty with the British in 1792.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nMeanwhile, Rana Bahadur Shah's youth had been spent in pampered luxury. In 1794 Rana Bahadur came of age, and his first act was to re-constitute the government, with his uncle, Bahadur Shah, removed from all official position.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=14}}{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=12}} In mid-1795, he became infatuated with a Maithili Brahman widow, Kantavati Jha, and married her on the oath of making their illegitimate half-caste son (as per the Hindu law of that time) the heir apparent, by excluding the legitimate heir from his previous marriage.{{refn|group=note|Rana Bahadur Shah had two legitimate wives before marrying Kantavati. His first wife was Rajrajeshwori Devi with whom he begot one daughter. His second wife was Subarnaprabha Devi with whom he begot two sons, Ranodyot Shah and Shamsher Shah.

Such acts earned Rana Bahadur notoriety both among courtiers and common people, especially among Brahmins.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=12}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=17\u201321}}\n\nThat same year in 1797, [[Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah Deva|Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah]] was born and was hastily declared the crown prince.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=22\u201325}} However, within a year of Girvan's birth, Kantavati contracted tuberculosis; and it was advised by physicians that she perform ascetic penances to cure herself. To make sure that Girvan succeeded to the throne while Kantavati was still alive, Rana Bahadur, aged just 23, abdicated in favor of their son on 23 March 1799, placing his first wife, [[Maharani Raj Rajeshwari Devi|Rajrajeshwori]], as the regent.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=22\u201325}} He joined his ailing wife, Kantavati, with his second wife, Subarnaprabha, in ascetic life and started living in Deopatan, donning saffron robes and titling himself Swami Nirgunanda or Nirvanananda.{{refn|group=note|From here on Rana Bahadur Shah became known as Swami Maharaj. Rana Bahadur, however, was an ascetic in name only. Although Rana Bahadur left the royal duties after his abdication, he did not relinquish any of its privileges and luxuries.{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=40}}}} This move was also supported by all the courtiers who were discontented with his wanton and capricious behavior.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=12}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=22\u201325}} It was around this time that both Bhimsen Thapa and his father [[Amar Singh Thapa (born 1759)|Amar Singh Thapa (sanu)]] were promoted from ''[[Subedar]]'' to the rank of ''[[Sardar]]'', and Bhimsen began to serve as the ex-King's chief bodyguard.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=24\u201325}} Bhimsen received the position of personal secretary of King Rana Bahadur from the patronage of ''[[Mulkaji]]'' [[Kirtiman Singh Basnyat]], since both his father and [[Birbhadra Thapa|grandfather]] were in close military affiliations with Kaji [[Abhiman Singh Basnyat]] - the uncle of Kirtiman Singh.{{sfn|Whelpton|1991|p=35}} Meanwhile, Rana Bahadur's renunciation lasted only a few months. After the inevitable death of Kantavati, Rana Bahadur suffered a mental breakdown during which he lashed out by desecrating temples and cruelly punishing the attendant physicians and astrologers.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=26\u201327}} He then renounced his ascetic life and attempted to re-assert his royal authority.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=28\u201332}} This led to a direct conflict with almost all the courtiers who had pledged a holy oath of allegiance to the legitimate King Girvan; this conflict eventually led to the establishment of a dual government and to an imminent civil war, with [[Damodar Pande]] leading the military force against the dissenting ex-King and his group.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=13}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=28\u201332}} Since most of the military officers had sided with the courtiers, Rana Bahadur realized that his authority could not be re-established; and he was forced to flee to the British-controlled city of [[Varanasi]] in May 1800.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=13}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=28\u201332}}\n\n===Exile in Varanasi: 1800\u20131804===\n[[File:Nepaul valley map 1802.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Kathmandu Valley made by Charles Crawford (a member of Captain Knox's entourage) in 1802\u201303.]]\nAs Rana Bahadur Shah's bodyguard and advisor, [[Sardar]] Bhimsen Thapa also accompanied him to Varanasi. Rana Bahadur's retinue included his first wife, [[Raj Rajeshwari Devi]], while his second wife, [[Subarna Prabha Devi]], stayed back in Kathmandu to serve as the regent.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=32}} Since Rana Bahadur was willing to do anything to regain his power and punish those who had forced him to exile, he served as a focal point of dissident factions in Varanasi. In November 1800, he first sought help from the British in exchange for which he was willing to concede a trading post in Kathmandu and grant them 37.5% of the tax revenue derived from the hills and 50% from the Terai.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=13}}{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=50}} However, the British were in favor of working with the existing government in Nepal, rather than risk the uncertainties of restoring an exiled ex-King to power.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=14}}{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=51}}\n\nThe Kathmandu Durbar was willing to appease the British and agreed to sign a commercial treaty so long as the wayward Rana Bahadur and his group were held in India under strict British surveillance.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=14}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=34}} This arrangement was kept a secret from Rana Bahadur and his group; but when they eventually became aware of the strictures on their movement, and hence the treaty, they were incensed at the British as well as the proponents ([[Damodar Pande]] and his faction) of this treaty in Nepal.{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=51}} An intrigue was set in motion with the aim of splitting the unity of courtiers in Kathmandu Durbar and fomenting anti-British feelings. A flurry of letters were exchanged between the ex-King and individual courtiers in which he tried to set them up against Damodar Pande and tried to woo them by promises of high government positions, which they could hold for their entire life, and which could be inherited by their progeny.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=38\u201342}}{{sfn|Nepal|2007|pp=52,56}} Baburam Acharya holds Bhimsen responsible for all these schemes, reasoning that Rana Bahadur did not have the mental capacity for such negotiations and intrigues. He contends that Bhimsen was responsible for negotiation with the British as well as responsible for writing letters in the name of the ex-King, while the ex-King was bidding his time in debauchery.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=38\u201342}}{{refn|group=note|Rana Bahadur Shah wrote the following letters: \n*A letter to his brother, Chautariya Sher Bahadur Shah, in an attempt to win him over.

The letters Rana Bahadur Shah wrote to Chautariya Sher Bahadur Shah also gave expression to brotherly affection, although it was Chautariya Sher Bahadur Shah himself who finally assassinated him. Rana Bahadur Shah also asked Chautariya Sher Bahadur Shah to make efforts to free him from detention. He wrote, ''Do whatever is possible so that the reign of (King Girvan) may be stable, the people who have come to Nepal from other countries may not be able to continue staying there and I may become free from detention and be able to come back to Nepal.''Rana Bahadur Shah also wrote, ''The treaty is only a pretext to create a split between you and me and make Krishna Shah King. This is the reason why Gajaraj Mishra and [[Damodar Pande]] have joined hands.'' He thus warned Chautariya Sher Bahadur Shah that the Bhardars were hatching a conspiracy to banish King Girvan to Gorkha.{{sfn|Nepali|1971|p=105}} \n*Rana Bahadur Shah wrote similar letters to Chautariya Bidur Shahi also.{{sfn|Nepali|1971|p=105}} \n*In addition, Rana Bahadur Shah wrote letters to a member of the Council of Kajis, [[Bakhtawar Singh Basnyat]], a brother of the murdered Kaji [[Kirtiman Singh Basnyat|Kirtiman Basnet]]. In these letters, Rana Bahadur Shah asked Bakhtawar Singh not only to make arrangements to free him from detention but also to beware of Gajraj Mishra, who had had the main hand in concluding the treaty with the British. He wrote, ''Gajaraj Mishra may try to win you over, or intimidate you, in our name as well as in that of our eldest queen. However, I have not sent him to Nepal. In fact, he has gone there in contravention of my order. Let nobody believe there that he has come there with my consent.''{{sfn|Nepali|1971|pp=105-106}}\n\nBhimsen Thapa and other followers too had written letters to Bakhatwar Singh Basnet referring to the detention of Rana Bahadur Shah and expressing opposition to the British, who had entered into Nepal. He viewed the British Residents to have interfered in the administration of native states, encourage factionalism and ultimately converted such states into British colonies.{{sfn|Nepali|1971|p=106}}}} Similarly, historian Chittaranjan Nepali considered that in addition to the realization of the motive of Nepali Bharadars to detain Rana Bahadur's retinue in Banaras, Bhimsen also had fully realized the real meaning of the system of protectorates adopted by the [[East India Company]] Government.{{sfn|Nepali|1971|p=105}}\n\nMeanwhile, Rajrajeshwari, perhaps due to frustration over her debauch husband{{refn|group=note|The exact reason for Rajrajeshwari's departure from Varanasi is a matter of controversy.

''Jagir'' lands assignments were made only for current services, while land granted in appreciation of past services were associated with the ''birta'' system.

As a further punishment, the Mukhtiyar cancelled their holidays on Saturday, whereas all other companies enjoyed such benefit.{{sfn|Acharya|1972|p=166}} Their ''Devata'' flag carried by ''Nishan'' flag-bearers were also treated with indignity.{{sfn|Acharya|1972|p=166}}\n\n===Hold on power===\n[[Image:Bhimsen-thapa-portrait.jpg|thumbnail|left|Bhimsen Thapa, the Prime Minister of Nepal from 1806 to 1837]]\nIn May 1816, Edward Gardner arrived in Kathmandu as the first British Resident after the conclusion of the Treaty of Sugauli. Bhimsen used all his influence to cultivate peace, although not friendliness, with the British, \"a Power,\" as he said, \"that crushed thrones like potsherds.\"{{sfn|Oldfield|1880|p=299}} His foreign policy after the war was essentially the one handed down by Prithvi Narayan Shah \u2013 to keep Nepal isolated from any foreign influences. As such, although he was forced to accept a British resident in Kathmandu as per the Treaty of Sugauli, he made sure to cut off the resident from all contacts with life in Nepal to the point of making the Resident a virtual prisoner. Apart from petty harassment, the Resident was only allowed to travel within the Kathmandu valley, that too only with special escorts. The resident was also barred from meeting the king or any courtiers at will. Thus the threat of having a Resident in Kathmandu was not as keen as had been anticipated.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=111}}\n\nOn 20 November 1816, King Girvan Yuddha died of smallpox, aged nineteen.{{sfn|Oldfield|1880|p=298}} Girvan had two wives \u2013 the first wife committed sati with Girvan, while the second wife also died of smallpox after 14 days of Girvan's death. Thus, Girvan was succeeded by his only son, [[Rajendra of Nepal|Rajendra Bikram Shah]], an infant of two years old, after 18 days of his father's death on 8 December 1816. Therefore, Bhimsen Thapa, in collusion with the queen regent, Tripurasundari, remained in power despite the defeat of Nepal in the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] of 1814\u201316.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=74\u201375}} There was a sustained opposition against Bhimsen from factions centered around leading members of other aristocratic families, notably the [[Pande family|Pandes]],{{refn|group=note|After the execution of Damodar Pande, some of his sons had managed to escape to India. During the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]], [[Rana Jang Pande]] had informed [[Ranabir Singh Thapa]] that the British would be off guard during Christmas. Following this advice, Ranbir Singh was able to obtain a major victory during a battle in Parsa. This won the [[Pande family (Nepal)|Pandes]] the trust of Ranbir Singh, which eventually led to their pardon by King Girvan and subsequent return to Nepal.{{sfn|Nepal|2007|pp=104\u2013105}} }} who denounced what they felt was his cowardly submission to the British. Paradoxically, the peacetime after the Anglo-Nepalese War saw the inflation and modernization of the Nepal army, which Bhimsen used to keep his opposition under control,{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=76}} while at the same time convincing the suspicious British that he had no intention of using it against them. Bhimsen appointed his own family members and his most trusted men to the highest positions at the court and in the army, while members of older aristocratic families were made administrators of far-flung provinces of the kingdom, away from the capital.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=77}}\n\nThus, Bhimsen was able to continue making all the administrative decisions of the country, while the Regent Queen Tripurasundari would unquestioningly approve these decisions by stamping the royal seal issued in the name of King Rajendra on these government orders. The Regent never dared to express any doubts regarding Bhimsen's decisions.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=147}} Nevertheless, to make sure that the King, his wives \u2013 Samrajya Laxmi Devi (senior) and Rajya Lakshmi Devi (junior) \u2013 and the Regent were insulated from influences of people other than Bhimsen and his closest relatives, Bhimsen had instated his youngest brother, [[Ranabir Singh Thapa|Ranvir Singh Thapa]], in the royal palace to keep a watch on the royal family and to keep guard against any outside person.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=148}} Any priest or courtier who wished to be granted an interview with the King, the Queens, or the Regent, had to get approval from Ranbir Singh and the interview had to be conducted under his watchful presence.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=148}} Similarly, the royal family was not allowed to leave the palace without Bhimsen's permission either. Bhimsen had also neglected the formal education of Rajendra, due to which he had grown to be uncritical and weak minded to the extent that he was even unaware that he was virtually a prisoner.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=148}} However, his wives were more alert and wary of Bhimsen since, according to [[Baburam Acharya]], they received unfiltered news of the world outside the royal palace from their handmaidens, who would leave the palace compounds and go to their homes during their menstruation and gather news and rumors of the day, which they would then relate to the Queens.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=148\u2013149}}\n\n==Infighting==\n[[File:King Bikram Shah Deva of Nepal.jpg|thumbnail|right|Portrait of Rajendra Bikram Shah.]]\n[[File:A Nepalese Official (Perhaps Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, served 1806-1837) LACMA M.91.206.jpg|right|thumb|Possible portrait of young Bhimsen Thapa]]\n\n===Reasons===\nThe Gorkha aristocracy had led Nepal into a disaster on the international front but preserved the political unity of the country, which at the end of the Anglo-Nepalese War in 1816 still was only about twenty-five years old as a unified nation. The success of the central government rested in part on its ability to appoint and control regional administrators, who also were high officers in the army. In theory, these officials had great local powers; in practice they spent little energy on the daily affairs of their subjects, interfering only when communities could not cope with problems or conflicts. Another reason for Gorkha success in uniting the country was the willingness to placate local leaders by preserving areas where former kings and communal assemblies continued to rule under the loose supervision of Kathmandu, leaving substantial parts of the country out of the control of regional administrators. Even within the areas directly administered by the central government, agricultural lands were given away as ''jagir'' to the armed services and as ''birta'' to court favorites and retired servicemen.{{refn|group=\"note\"|name=\"land ownership\"}} The holder of such grants in effect became the lord of the peasants working there, with little if any state interference.{{sfn|Regmi|1976|p=18}} From the standpoint of the average cultivator, the government remained a distant force, and the main authority figure was the landlord, who took part of the harvest, or (especially in the Tarai) the tax collector, who was often a private individual contracted to extort money or crops in return for a share.{{sfn|Regmi|1976|p=33}} For the leaders in the administration and the army, as military options became limited and alternative sources of employment grew very slowly, career advancement depended less on attention to local conditions than on loyalty to factions fighting at court.{{sfn|Savada|1993}}\n\n===Actors===\nFive leading families or factions contended for power during this period\u2014the [[Shah dynasty|Shahs]], [[Thapa dynasty|Thapas]], [[Basnyat family|Basnyats]], [[Pande family (Nepal)|Pandes]], and the Chautariyas, who were of Shah dynasty but acted as counselors for the King. Working for these families and their factions were hill Brahmans, who acted as religious preceptors or astrologers, and [[Newars]], who occupied secondary administrative positions. No one else in the country had any influence on the central government. When a family or faction achieved power, it killed, exiled, or demoted members of opposing alliances. Under these circumstances, there was little opportunity for either public political life or coordinated economic development.{{sfn|Savada|1993}}{{sfn|Joshi|Rose|1966|pp=23\u201325}}\n\n===Consequences===\nThe struggle for power at the court had unfortunate consequences for both foreign affairs and for internal administration. All parties tried to satisfy the army in order to avoid interference in court affairs by leading commanders, and the military was given a free hand to pursue ever-larger conquests. As long as the Gorkhas were invading disunited hill states, this policy\u2014or lack of policy\u2014was adequate. Inevitably, continued aggression led Nepal into disastrous collisions with the Chinese and then with the British. At home, because power struggles centered on control of the king, there was little progress in sorting out procedures for sharing power or expanding representative institutions. A consultative body of nobles, a royal court called the Assembly of Lords (Bharadari Sabha), was in place after 1770 and it had substantial involvement in major policy issues. The assembly consisted of high government officials and leading courtiers, all heads of important Gorkha families. In the intense atmosphere surrounding the monarch, however, the Assembly of Lords broke into factions that fought for access to the prime minister or regent, and alliances developed around patron/client relationships.{{sfn|Savada|1993}}{{sfn|Joshi|Rose|1966|pp=25\u201327}}\n\n==Downfall: 1832\u20131838==\n[[File:King Rajendra Bikram Shah Deva.jpg|thumb|Portrait of King [[Rajendra Bikram Shah]].]]\n[[File:King Surendra Bikram Shah 1.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of King [[Surendra Bikram Shah]].]]\n\n===Death of Queen Tripurasundari===\nThe power balance began to change after King Rajendra came of age and his grandmother, Tripurasundari, died on 26 March 1832 due to cholera.{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=103}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=149}} Bhimsen lost his main support and the court became a stage for a power struggle, which even though started off as an attempt to assert the King's authority from the ''Mukhtiyar'', spread to various aristocratic clans and their attempt to secure total authority.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|pp=155\u2013156}} However, King Rajendra still feared the ''Mukhtiyar'' and the [[Thapa dynasty|Thapa faction]] as \"...a race of men who for the last fifty-five years have dragged the country and its princes at the wheels of military car.\"{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|pp=155}} It was no secret that Bhimsen was able to maintain his supremacy due to the large standing army under his and his family's command; and in the subsequent years, different factions would attempt to increase their influence based on the strength of the number of battalions under their grip.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|pp=155\u2013156}} After Tripurasundari's death, the royal seal by which government orders were approved naturally went into the hands of the senior queen Samrajya Laxmi, who knew all too well of its powers and wanted to emulate the queens of the past by establishing her own regency.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=149}}{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=156}}\n\nSensing Samrajya Laxmi's ambition, Ranbir Singh started to stroke her dislike of Bhimsen in the hopes of becoming the ''Mukhtiyar'' himself.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=149}} There was a quarrel between Bhimsen's nephew, [[Mathabar Singh Thapa]], and Ranbir Singh regarding the latter's shift of loyalty towards the Senior Queen Samrajya Lakshmi, resulting in Mathabar resigning from the command of Sri Nath Regiment.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=147}} Getting a whiff of this matter, Bhimsen strongly reprimanded Ranbir Singh which caused him to resign from his General's position and live in retirement in his house at Sipamandan.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=149\u2013150}} However, Bhimsen later managed to placate his brother, by giving him the title of Chota (Little) General, and send him to Palpa as its governor.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=151}}{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=148}} To counter the opposition arising in Darbar after the incident, he appointed young Kaji Surath Singh Thapa, a grandson of Bada Kaji [[Amar Singh Thapa]] to a very high administrative position in the Darbar and made him joint chief signatory.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=148}} Since he could find nobody that he could trust to keep watch over the royal palace, Bhimsen from then on started to live in an ordinary rented house located near the palace premise.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=150}}\n\n===Sharing of administrative duties===\nThe King and the Queens also started to openly challenge Bhimsen's authority. By this time, Rajendra and his wives had heard the widespread rumor that Bhimsen, in order to remain in power, had killed the late King Girvan and his wives by administering poison a few days after Girvan's coming off age. So when Rajendra was afflicted by an ordinary illness, the Queens cautioned the King and prohibited him to take the medicine offered by the royal physician, Sardar Ekdev Upadhyay, who was loyal to Bhimsen.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=150}} Similarly, during the annual muster of 1833, during which the civil and military officers were promoted, renewed, retained, or retired, everything was conducted according to Bhimsen's plan, but Rajendra delayed the retainment of Bhimsen's own position as the ''Mukhtiyar''.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=150}}\n\nThis forced Bhimsen to share the administrative burden between Rajendra, Samrajya Laxmi, and himself, and ask for their opinions on administrative matters, in order to reduce further friction between himself and the royalty. Rajendra was put in charge of defense, finance, and foreign relations; while Samrajya Laxmi was put in charge of justice, accountancy, and civil administration.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=152}} Nevertheless, Rajendra's activities were heavily influenced by the advice of Samrajya Laxmi, while the Junior Queen Rajya Laxmi had no say in any matter; furthermore, the King and the Senior Queen did not dare yet to outright dismiss Bhimsen's plans and advice, fearful of the large army under his command.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=152}} This arrangement worked well for the next three years; for instance, on 26 August 1833, Nepal was struck by a great earthquake,{{sfn|Dasgupta|2015|pp=491-513}} and all three power holders were able to coordinate with each other and provide emergency relief to the citizens.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=152}}{{refn|group=note| There were two fore-shocks occurring at 6:30 PM and 11:30 PM, with the main shock, felt around 11:55 PM Calcutta time (10:58 PM Kathmandu time). The epicenter was close to Kathmandu. It has been estimated that its epicenter was around 28.0\u00b0N, 86.0\u00b0E and its magnitude to be around 7.7 Mw. It reportedly killed 414 people, wounded 172 people, and destroyed 4040 houses in Nepal.{{sfn|Dasgupta|2015|pp=491-513}}}}\n\n===Mounting frustration of the Senior Queen===\n[[File:Ranabir Singh Thapa.jpg|thumb|[[Ranabir Singh Thapa]]]]\nQueen Samrajya Laxmi was ambitious to show herself as powerful and as independent as her predecessor Queen Tripurasundari.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=156}} Initially, King Rajendra supported Bhimsen instead of [[Ranabir Singh Thapa|Ranbir Singh]] and the removal of Ranabir Singh sabotaged the Queen's plan.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=148}} King Rajendra appointed Bhimsen to the post of [[Commander-In-Chief of the Nepalese Army|Commander-In-Chief]] and praised Bhimsen for his long service to the nation.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=149}} However, Queen Samrajya Laxmi would harass King Rajendra by such words as:\n\n{{Quote|You are an independent Raja indeed. You are a slave of Bhim Sen Thapa.... a sheep led to the slaughter. Has he bewitch you or has he poured lead into your ears rendering you deaf. Let me and my children leave you to the fate your imbecility deserve, or ...you become religious and go to Benaras to bath and pray and leave me without the eldest boy to rule the country and try if a women can succeed where a man has failed in annihilating the [[Thapa family|Thapas]] and asserting the lawful rights of sovereignty among her people.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=149}}}}\n\nQueen Samrajya Laxmi was very frustrated by King Rajendra's failure to remove Bhimsen from power. On 8 November 1835, she caused a turmoil by leaving the Durbar at midnight, angered by King Rajendra's inability to stop Bhimsen from dealings with the Governor General, with whom she felt the King should be  directly dealing with.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|pp=156-157}} Meanwhile, she demanded the King to establish a new regiment; however the King failed to obtain the required financial allocation from the ''Mukhtiyar''. Instead, King Rajendra authorized Bhimsen with a ''Sunnad'' in favour of the ''Mukhtiyar''. Upon learning this, the Queen Samrajya Laxmi shouted angrily at King Rajendra:\n\n{{Quote|You have given him a Sunnad making once for all everything to the Minister, who with his family and creatures will eat up all so that neither have we any right nor any means to provide for our children. You are no Raja, other rule and spend, you have your mere [[throne|gaddi]] and mouthful to eat. Such too is my share and your children.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=157}}}}\n\nShe also demanded an allocation of [[Nepalese Rupee|Rs.]] 50,000 for her children from the [[Terai]] revenues. If her demands were not to be met, she threatened to part from the state affairs. However, despite all her efforts to pressurize King Rajendra, she achieved no success.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=157}}\n\n===Failure of Mathabar Singh Thapa's mission to Britain===\n[[File:Brian Houghton Hodgson by Louisa Starr-Canziani.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Brian Houghton Hodgson]].]]\n[[File:Colonel Mathabar Singh Thapa 1.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Colonel [[Mathabar Singh Thapa]] from 1831]]\nThat same year, [[Brian Houghton Hodgson|Brian Hodgson]], who had spent many years in Nepal serving as the Assistant Resident, and who had a good knowledge about Nepal's biodiversity, culture, and politics, became the new British Resident.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=151}}{{sfn|Rana|1988|p=14}} Although the British Residents were officially instructed to keep out of the internal politics of Nepal, the Resident was courted by both the King as well as the ''Mukhtiyar''. Hodgson was waiting for an opportunity to exploit the rift between the ''Mukhtiyar'' and the royal family and begin a more aggressive campaign to increase British influence and trading opportunities.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=151}}{{sfn|Rana|1988|pp=15\u201316}} Hodgson also believed the large standing army to be a security threat{{sfn|Rana|1988|p=15}} and that the border tensions could be pacified if the King was directly in control, rather than a ''Mukhtiyar'' who needed to keep on the right side of the army.{{sfn|Whelpton|2004|p=27}} By 1834, Hodgson had come to a conclusion that he would not be able to have his way so long as Bhimsen was in control of the Nepalese administration;{{sfn|Rana|1988|p=16}} thus he strongly sympathized with the Pande faction,{{sfn|Whelpton|2004|p=27}} and he wished to install [[Fatte Jang Chautaria|Fateh Jung Shah]], who was more favorably disposed to him, as the ''Mukhtiyar''.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=153}} Hodgson reported to the Government of India on the dominance of Bhimsen over the position of the King as:\n\n{{Quote|the Rajah is surrounded by the Minister's creature and is at present helpless. Bhim Sen has all the powers in his hands...The Rajah is so uncomfortable in his honorary confinement that the probability is the Minister may work on him with success to make voluntary retirement of his throne in favour of his infant son and in the highest conformity with the [[Dharmashastra|sacred code]] of the [[Hindu]], to which His Highness is proved.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=127}}}}\n\nIn August 1834, Hodgson proposed to conduct a new commercial treaty between Nepal and Britain, which Bhimsen in principle agreed to but disagreed with several of the clauses.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=153}}{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=104}}{{sfn|Rana|1988|p=17}} At a time when his authority was diminishing, Bhimsen could not afford to antagonize the Resident; but at the same time, he could not accept his proposals and be seen as subservient to the British by the Nepalese court. Nevertheless, he tried to maintain a friendly and conciliatory attitude toward the Resident, in order to win him as his ally, by loosening the restrictions on his movements and granting direct access to the King.{{sfn|Rana|1988|p=18}}\n\nIn the meantime, a royal letter was received from the Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]], ruler of [[Sikh Empire]] in Punjab, addressed to King Rajendra. The Nepalese court seized this opportunity to re-establish diplomatic contact with Punjab as well as other states such as [[Burma]] and [[Gwalior]].{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=152}} In April 1835, Bhimsen also hatched a plan to make a state visit to Britain, hoping to force Britain to acknowledge the sovereignty of Nepal; but since he could not make the visit himself, his nephew Colonel [[Mathabarsingh Thapa|Mathabar Singh Thapa]] was chosen as the representative of Nepal, bearing a few gifts and a letter from King Rajendra addressed to [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]].{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=104}}{{sfn|Rana|1988|p=18}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=152\u2013153}} The idea was initially received favorably by Hodgson as well as the Governor-General, who hoped that the mission could increase the trust between the two nations.{{sfn|Rana|1988|p=18}} In this process, Mathabar Singh was promoted to Chota General; his brother, Ranbir Singh, the governor of Palpa, was made Full General; and Mathabar's nephew, the sixteen-year-old Sher Jung Thapa, was made Commanding Colonel. Thus, Bhimsen managed to consolidate his military powers.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=152\u2013153}} Both Rajendra and Samrajya Laxmi were also pleased with this plan, and on 1 November 1835, Bhimsen was conferred the title of [[Commander-In-Chief of the Nepalese Army|Commander-in-Chief]].{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=153}}{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=104}} On 27 November 1835, Mathabar Singh left Kathmandu with a retinue of two thousand men, including 200 officers and 600 soldiers, for London via Calcutta.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=153}}{{sfn|Rana|1988|p=19}}\n\nMathabar was given a grand welcome in Calcutta by the acting Governor-General [[Charles Metcalfe, 1st Baron Metcalfe|Charles Metcalfe]]; and while there, Mathabar started to indulge in needless luxuries and show offs.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=153\u2013154}} Meanwhile, Hodgson sent a secret letter to Metcalfe asking him not to allow Mathabar to make a state visit to Britain.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=154}} Hence, Metcalfe was only willing to grant him the visa of an ordinary traveler, and not the diplomatic visa of a state representative. Mathabar thus returned to Nepal in March 1836, having wasted a vast sum of money, without accomplishing any of his goals.{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=104}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=154}} The deliberate sabotage of Mathabar's mission was Hodgson's diplomatic attack against Bhimsen.{{sfn|Rana|1988|p=19}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=154}} Until that time, it was widely believed by both the royal family as well as the common people that Bhimsen's good relationship with the high ranking British officials, since he was the only one allowed to communicate with them, was responsible for preventing the East India Company to take full control of Nepal. The mission's failure unambiguously revealed to everyone that this was not the case, and severely undermined Bhimsen's political credibility.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=154}} Mathabar Singh spent a sum of one lakh and fifty thousand in Calcutta on the fruitless mission.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=150}} Mathabar's extravagant expenditure was also heavily criticized by Samrajya Laxmi, since at that time the state coffer was in dire condition; and to pacify her, Bhimsen had to reimburse the extra expenses from his own pockets.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=156}}\n\n===Rise of the [[Kala Pandes]]===\n[[File:Ranajang_Pande.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of [[Ranajang Pande]].]]\nBy this time, [[Rana Jang Pande|Ranajang Pande]], the youngest son of [[Damodar Pande]], was stationed as a captain in the army in Kathmandu.

This news was spread all over the country by the Pandes, and the resulting public disgrace forced Mathabar to leave Kathmandu and reside in his ancestral home in Pipal Thok, Borlang, Gorkha.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=155}} To save face, Bhimsen gave Mathabar the governorship of Gorkha.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=155}}\n\nTaking advantage of Mathabar's absence in Kathmandu, the military battalions under his command were distributed to other courtiers during the annual muster at the beginning of 1837.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=156}} Nevertheless, Bhimsen managed to secure his and his family members' positions in the civil and military offices. An investigation was also started to check Bhimsen's expenditures in establishing various battalions.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=156}} Such events led the courtiers to feel that Bhimsen's ''Mukhtiyari'' would not last very long; thus Ranbir Singh, in the hopes of becoming the next ''Mukhtiyar'', wrote a letter to the King asking him to be recalled to Kathmandu from Palpa. His wish was granted; and Bhimsen, pleased to see his brother after many years, made Ranbir Singh the acting ''Mukhtiyar'' and decided to go to his ancestral home in Borlang Gorkha for the sake of pilgrimage.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=157}} But in truth, Bhimsen had gone to Gorkha to placate his nephew and bring him back to Kathmandu.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=157}}\n\nIn Bhimsen's absence, King Rajendra established a new battalion, ''Hanuman Dal'', to be kept under his personal command. By February 1837, both Ranajang and his brother, Ranadal Pande, had been promoted to the position of a ''kaji''; and Ranajang was made a personal secretary to the King, while Ranadal Pande was made the governor of Palpa.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=158}} Ranjang was also made the chief palace guard, the position formerly occupied by Ranbir Singh and then Bhimsen. Thus, this curtailed Bhimsen's access to the royal family.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=158}} On 14 June 1837, the King took over the command of all the battalions put in charge of various courtiers, and himself became the Commander-in-Chief.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=215}}{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=105}}\n\n===Poisoning case===\nOn 24 July 1837, Rajendra's youngest son, Devendra Bikram Shah, an infant of six months, died suddenly.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=158}}{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=105}} It was at once rumored that the child had died of poison intended for his mother the Senior Queen Samrajya Laxmi Devi: given at the instigation of Bhimsen, or someone of his faction.{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=105}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=159}}{{sfn|Whelpton|2004|pp=28\u201329}} On this charge, Bhimsen, his brother Ranbir Singh, his nephew Mathbar Singh, their families, the court physicians, [[Sardar]] Ekdev and Eksurya Upadhyay, and his deputy Bhajuman Baidya, with a few more of the nearest relatives of the Thapas were incarcerated, proclaimed outcasts, and their properties confiscated.{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=105}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=159}}{{sfn|Acharya|1971a|p=13}}{{sfn|Oldfield|1880|p=310}} The physicians Ekdev and Eksurya, being Brahmins, were severely tortured but spared, while Bhajuman Baidya was impaled and killed.{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=106}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=160}}{{refn|group=note|Historian [[Baburam Acharya]] writes that Bhajuman Baidya confessed that he treated the young prince with the medicine provided by Ekadev Baidya under torture.

Bhimsen had nothing to gain by killing an infant less a year old, and the accusation was simply a ruse to answer foreign inquiries on Bhimsen's imprisonment.{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=107}} It was a general practice among the physicians of the time to check the strength of their medicine by first letting the mother taste it, before giving it to their newborn.{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=108}} It was later rumored that it was the Junior Queen who had actually contrived to kill the Senior Queen by poisoning the medicine intended for her newborn. While the poison did not express itself on the intended Queen, it managed to kill the infant prince, and the powerless Bhimsen was made a convenient scapegoat.{{sfn|Oldfield|1880|p=310}}{{sfn|Nepal|2007|pp=108\u2013109}}{{sfn|Hunter|1896|pp=130, 159}} Historian Gyanmani Nepal contends this to be closer to the truth.{{sfn|Nepal|2007|pp=108\u2013109}}\n\n===Dismissal from office and subsequent pardon===\n[[File:Portrait of Rangnath Paudel.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Pandit [[Ranga Nath Poudyal]].]]\nImmediately after the incarceration of the Thapas, a new government with joint ''Mukhtiyars'' was formed with Ranganath Paudel as the head of civil administration, and [[Dalbhanjan Pande]] and Ranajang Pande as joint heads of military administration.{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=106}} This appointment established the Pandes as the dominant faction in the court, and they started to make preparations for war with the British in order to win back the lost territories of Kumaon and Garhwal.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=163}} While such war posturing was nothing new, the din the Pandes created alarmed not just the Resident Hodgson{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=163}} but the opposing court factions as well, who saw their aggressive policy as detrimental to the survival of the country.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=164}} After about three months in power, under pressure from the opposing factions, the King removed Ranjang as ''Mukhtiyar'' and Ranganath Paudel, who was favorably inclined towards the Thapas, was chosen as the sole ''Mukhtiyar''.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=160}}{{sfn|Oldfield|1880|p=311}}{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=109}}{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=164}}\n\nFearful that the Pandes would re-establish their power, [[Fateh Jung Shah|Fatte Jang Shah]], Ranganath Poudel, and the Junior Queen [[Rajya Laxmi Devi]] obtained from the King the liberation of Bhimsen, Mathabar, and the rest of the faction, in March 1838 about eight months after they were incarcerated for the poisoning case.{{sfn|Oldfield|1880|p=311}}{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=109}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=161}} Some of their confiscated land, as well as the [[Bagh Durbar]], was also returned. Upon his release, the soldiers loyal to Bhimsen crowded behind him in jubilation and followed him up to his house; a similar treatment was given to Mathabar Singh and Sher Jung Thapa.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=164}} Although pardon had been granted to Bhimsen, his former office was not re-instated; thus he went to live in retirement at his patrimony in Borlang, Gorkha.{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=109}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=161}}\n\nHowever, Ranganath Poudel, finding himself unsupported by the King, resigned from the ''Mukhtiyari'', which was then conferred on [[Chautariya Pushkar Shah|Pushkar Shah]]; but Pushkar Shah was only a nominal head, and the actual authority was bestowed on Ranjang Pande.{{sfn|Oldfield|1880|p=313}} Sensing that a catastrophe was going to befall the Thapas, Mathabar Singh fled to India while pretending to go on a hunting trip; Ranbir Singh gave up all his property and became a [[sannyas|sanyasi]], titling himself Abhayanand Puri; but Bhimsen Thapa preferred to remain in his old home in Gorkha.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=161}}{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=110}} The Pandes were now in full possession of power; they had gained over the King to their side by flattery.

In the description given in the portrait, he is titled as General [[Commander-In-Chief of the Nepalese Army|Commander-in-Chief]].]]\nAt the beginning of 1839, Ranajang Pande was made the sole ''Mukhtiyar''. However, knowledge about Ranajang's war preparations and his communication with other princely states of India, fomenting anti-British sentiments, alarmed the Governor-General of the time, [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland|Lord Auckland]], who mobilized some British troops near the border of Nepal.{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=110}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=161\u2013162}} In order to resolve this diplomatic fiasco, Bhimsen was recalled from Gorkha and the rest of his confiscated property was also released.{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=111}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=162}} Bhimsen suggested some of the battalions under Ranjang's command to be given to other courtiers, thus severely weakening Ranjang's military power, and in the process convincing the British that Nepal was not on the path to war.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=163}} The King agreed to this arrangement; however, this aroused a strong suspicion in Samrajya Laxmi, who determined to eradicate Bhimsen's influence permanently.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=163}}\n\nIn April 1839, the accusation of poisoning the young prince in 1837, along with two other fabricated cases, was revived against Bhimsen and his faction, and forged papers and evidence were produced professing to incriminate him.{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=111}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=163}}{{sfn|Oldfield|1880|p=315}} The date when Bhimsen was charged on the alleged crime was 18 May 1839, according to then Assistant British Resident J.R.

The Assistant British Resident J.R. Tickell observed that \"...Not a voice raised in his (Bhimsen's) behalf throughout the Darbar, the chiefs sat by in dejected silence.\"{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=167}} Bhimsen appealed for justice and tried to defend himself, but the King, blindly believing the forgeries, denounced him as a traitor and put him in house arrest in a room at the ground floor of his own Bagh Durbar.{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=111}}{{sfn|Oldfield|1880|p=315}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=164}} Although pardon had already been given, based on these forged evidences, the court physicians, Ekdev and Eksurya Upadhyay were again arrested and tortured. Except for Mathabar Singh, who managed to escape to India, rest of the Thapa family were again arrested, their properties confiscated, were declared outcasts, and were proclaimed to be expelled from every public office for seven generations.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=164}}{{sfn|Acharya|1971a|p=13}}{{sfn|Oldfield|1880|p=316}}\n\nWhile under house arrest, Bhimsen smuggled a letter to the Resident Hodgson appealing him to intervene on his behalf, which Hodgson refused at that moment but sought permission from his superiors to do so.{{sfn|Whelpton|2004|p=29-30}} Bhimsen was given brutal treatment at the orders of Rana Jang during the arrest. Rana Jang did not choose direct assassination of Bhimsen but some strong calculated savage measures to make Bhimsen commit suicide.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=168}} One of the savage measures was that the false rumours on the method of punishment to Bhimsen was circulated every day.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=168}} Meanwhile, Bhimsen's third wife, Bhakta Kumari, happened to insult the Senior Queen Samrajya Laxmi, who upon hearing about this insult, was so angered that she order Bhakta Kumari to be removed from Bagh Durbar and put in a common jail.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=164}} After this, a rumor started to spread around Kathmandu that Bhakta Kumari would be stripped of her clothes and paraded through the streets of the city.{{sfn|Oldfield|1880|p=316}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=164}}{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=168}} This rumor also fell on Bhimsen's ears; and unable to bear such indignity, Bhimsen attempted suicide by slitting his throat with a [[khukuri]] on 28 July 1839.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=164}} The news of this attempted suicide further angered the King and the Queen, who came to look at his body, and instead of feeling sympathy for the old minister and ordering immediate medical care, Bhimsen's blood-soaked, unconscious body was ordered that same day to be dragged through the streets and dumped by the same bank of Bishnumati river, where Bhimsen had dumped the dead bodies of 45 people 33 years ago during the Bhandarkhal massacre.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=165}} Bhimsen finally died nine days later, surrounded by vultures, jackals, and dogs, on 5 August 1839, at the age of 64.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=165}} Since suicide was considered a grave crime, soldiers were stationed at his death spot so that his body would not be removed and given ordinary cremation rites; and his body was allowed to be devoured by scavenging animals.{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=111}}{{sfn|Oldfield|1880|p=316}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=165}} On the spot where Bhimsen drew his last breath, a Shiva temple by the name Bhim-Mukteshwar was later constructed by his nephew Mathabar Singh Thapa.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=166}}\n\nWhile there is a general consensus on the cause and circumstances of Bhimsen's death, there is a disagreement on the exact date of his death. Baburam Acharya contends that Bhimsen attempted suicide on 28 July in his house and died nine days later on 5 August by the banks of Bishnumati;{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=165}} while Henry Oldfield, [[Kumar Pradhan|K.L. Pradhan]], and Gyanmani Nepal contend that the suicide was attempted on 20 July and the death occurred nine days later on 28 July in his house, only after which his dead body was disposed by the banks of Bishnumati.{{sfn|Oldfield|1880|p=316}}{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=111}}{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=168}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Mathabar Singh Thapa portrait.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Mukhtiyar [[Mathabar Singh Thapa]].]]\n[[File:Sir Jang Bahadur Kunwar Rana (1850).jpg|thumb|right|[[Jang Bahadur Kunwar Rana]] in a portrait of 1850.]]\nThe death of Bhimsen Thapa did not resolve the factional fighting at court. Five months after Bhimsen's death, Ranajang Pande was again made prime minister; but Ranajang's inability to control the general lawlessness in the country forced him to resign from prime minister's office, which was then conferred on Puskar Shah, based on Samrajya Laxmi's recommendation.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=167}} While Pushkar Shah was not as anti-British as Ranajang Pande, he was nevertheless unfavorably predisposed towards them. During his tenure, a border dispute with the British in April 1840 resulted in Governor-General of India, [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland|1st Earl of Auckland]] dispatching some troop near the Nepalese border once again, which Pushkar managed to resolve diplomatically.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=167\u2013168}} There was also a brief army mutiny in June 1840, as a reaction against the government's attempt to cut military salary, during which houses of several noblemen in favor of this unpopular act were vandalized and burned. The mutiny was calmed only after King Rajendra publicly agreed not to implement the reform.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=168\u2013169}} Taking advantage of this mutiny, Resident [[Brian Houghton Hodgson|Hodgson]] sent an incriminating report against the Nepalese government to his superiors in Calcutta. The Governor-General demanded the King to dissolve the incumbent government and appoint ministers more favorable towards the British. Thus, Pushkar Shah and his Pande associates were dismissed, and Fateh Jang Shah was appointed the Prime Minister in November 1840.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=170}} Dismissal of Pushkar Shah curtailed Samrajya Laxmi's power. When Rajendra refused to abdicate in favor of their eldest son [[Surendra of Nepal|Surendra]], the heir apparent, she left Kathmandu and settled at a border town in Terai. However, during the monsoon season, Samrajya Laxmi was afflicted with malaria from which she died in October 1841 at the age of twenty-seven.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=171\u2013172}}\n\nThe death of the Senior Queen Samrajya Laxmi allowed the emergence of the Junior Queen Rajya Laxmi and Crown Prince Surendra onto the political stage. To consolidate her political influence and see her own son, rather than the heir apparent, Surendra, succeed on the throne, Rajya Laxmi had obtained pardon for Sher Jung Thapa and other jailed members of Thapa family. It was only after this that Bhimsen Thapa managed to get a symbolic funeral rite in August 1841.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=172\u2013174}} Thus, the Nepalese court was split into three factions centered around the King, the Queen, and the Crown Prince. Fateh Jung and his administration supported the King, the [[Thapa dynasty|Thapas]] supported the Junior Queen, while the [[Pande family|Pandes]] supported the Crown Prince. The resurgent Thapa coalition succeeded in sowing animosity between Fateh Jung's ministry and the Pande coalition, who were swiftly imprisoned.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=173\u2013176}} During his two years in power, Fateh Jung was able to maintain a rule of law in the country; however, after the incarceration of the Pandes, nobody could rein in the worsening sadistic tendencies, sometimes with fatal consequences, of Surendra, who was then still a minor.{{refn|group=note| Whelpton: \"In May 1842 the Residency diary records that one of Surendra's wives, a girl of only nine years, died after he had made her stand all day in a tank of water at the palace.\"{{sfn|Whelpton|2004|p=32}} }} Under immense pressure from the Queen and the nobility, along with the backing from army and the general populace, the King in January 1843 handed the highest authority of the state to his Junior Queen, Rajya Laxmi, curtailing both his own and his son's power.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=176\u2013177}}{{sfn|Whelpton|2004|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nThe Queen, seeking the support of her own son's claims to the throne over those of Surendra, invited Mathabar Singh Thapa back after almost six years in exile.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=177\u2013178}} Upon his arrival in Kathmandu, an investigation of his uncle's death took place, and a number of his Pande enemies were massacred.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=179\u2013181}} As for Ranajang Pande, he had by that time contracted mental illness and would not have posed any threat to Mathabar. Nevertheless, Ranajang was paraded through the streets and made to witness the execution of his family members, after which he was forced to commit suicide by poison.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=179\u2013181}} By December 1843, Mathabar Singh was appointed prime minister; but after a year in power, he alienated both the King and the Queen by supporting Surendra's claim over the throne. On 17 May 1845, he was assassinated, on both the King and Queen's orders, by his nephew, [[Jang Bahadur|Jang Bahadur Kunwar]]. The death of Mathabar Singh ended the Thapa hegemony and set the stage for [[Kot massacre]] and the establishment of [[Rana Dynasty]], a dictatorship of hereditary prime ministers, which was founded on the basic template provided by Bhimsen Thapa. These events provided the long period of stability the country needed but at the cost of political and economic development.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=11\u201312}}\n\n==Reforms and Heritages==\n===Reforms===\n[[File:Picture of bhimsen thapa standing beside a horse.jpg|thumb|Picture of Bhimsen Thapa standing beside a horse in the reformed Nepalese military uniforms designed from [[French military]] uniform]] \nBhimsen implemented the reorganization of [[Nepalese Army]] on the basis of European military system and the maintenance of the newly reorganized strong army was done from the confiscation of ''Birta'' funds of 1805.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=29}} He appointed French military officials to modernize the military on the basis of [[French military]] ranks and uniforms. Military jobs were made attractive by increasing facilities including ''Jhara'' (porter) facility even in the peacetime under his ''Mukhtiyari''.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=29}} Due to extensive lack of labour forces in the country, he issued legal obligations to all adult males of all castes to provide compulsory labour to the state subject to royal exemptions. Those state jobs included construction and maintenance of forts, bridges, roads, and production of ammunition for military expeditions.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|pp=29\u201330}} ''Hulaki'' (postal) system from Kathmandu to the western front was implemented in 1804 through rotational [[relay]]s of [[porters]]. In 1808 during the premiership of Bhimsen, it was reported that minors were engaged in Hulaki services in the villages with small Hulaki households. The regulation issued by Bhimsen's government was to increase the number of relays in the villages consisting low Hulaki households and person forcing minors and females for personal Hulaki services would be severely punished.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=30}} These Jhara (porter) services for Hulaki system were regularly required due to which some were compensated with land under ''Adhiya'' (half-ownership) tenure and others in the form of cash wages compensation.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=31}} Regulations issued in July 1809 was:\n{{Quote|In the areas west of [[Dharmasthali]] (in Kathmandu) and east of [[Bheri River]], inspect whether or not Hulaki outposts for transport or mail have been established as mentioned in the previous order.

In 1812, he imposed a general restriction on [[human trafficking]] in [[Garhwal region|Garhwal]] Sirmur and other areas.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=33}} Around 1808, Bhimsen ordered the reclamation of wastelands in [[Terai]] region for increasing state revenue and offered irrigation facilities to settlers reclaiming the wastelands.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|pp=33\u201334}} In places where there was a lack of tenants, farmers were allocated the wastelands with tax exemption and loan was provided for new incoming settlers. The wastelands reclamation policy was largely advantageous to the government and tenants, and was greatly successful in Eastern Terai.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|pp=33\u201334}} For the coordination of this policy, officials were appointed all over the state in 1811.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=34}} The trade policy of Bhimsen Thapa was influenced from King [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] who believed foreign (in the context English) traders would weaken the economy of the country and impoverish the general people. Customs offices were relocated within the country to reduce discomfort to native traders. Essential arrangements and facilities were provided to native traders and officials were warned not to intimidate native traders.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=34}} Bhimsen is quoted to have said: {{Quote|If Tibetans and Firangis [i.e. foreigners or, in the contemporary context, Englishmen] meet and trade with each other, our ryots and traders will lose their employment and result will not be good.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=35}}}} After 1807, markets were opened in the Terai and [[Inner Terai]] under direct governmental efforts and supervision to facilitate native traders. For instances; in 1809, market towns were made at Hitaruwa in Makawanpur and at Bhadaruwa in Saptari.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=35}} Indian traders were also encouraged to trade within the country{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=34}} and Nepalese officials were instructed to take care of the development of border markets, [[land reclamation]] and settlement, and protection of land encroachment.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=35}} In 1811, timber exports from Chitwan to Calcutta were introduced together with the diversification of agricultural products to strengthen the export. Also, mining and [[minting coins]] were undertaken by the Bhimsen government.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=35}} Bhimsen considered [[Sivalik Hills|Churia hills]] as the basic line of defense of the [[Kingdom of Nepal]]. He thus wanted to build communications to the western parts such as [[Kumaon region|Kumaon]], [[Garhwal region|Garhwal]] and [[Yamuna]]-[[Sutlej]] region of Kingdom of Nepal and block the strategic routes to the [[Kathmandu valley]].{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|pp=35\u201336}} The possessions of passers-by were strictly searched and even private letters were censored.

We shall behead you.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=36}}}} \nBhimsen put forth the principle of [[Equality before the law]] in Nepal. In 1826, a regulation was issued by him through ''Lalmohar'' (Red Seal) of [[Maharaja]] directing Kaji [[Dalbhanjan Pande]] to maintain the sanctity of judiciary and it further stated:\n{{Quote|irrespective of castes, creeds or position in the society, all are same in the eyes of law.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=184}}}} ''Mohi'' ([[tenant farmer]]s) felt it easier to pay taxes in kind to their [[Zamindars]] due to cash shortage. He directed the [[Zamindars]] to accept foodgrain as tax and not to harass the farmers. The regulation further directed that it was the responsibility of Zamindars to make arrangements for cash and not of the farmers.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=182}} The [[anti-bribery]] regulations were issued due to reports of Zamindars, Amalis, and regional officials taking up bribery from people in the far-flung provinces. Bhimsen through his regulations declared it illegal to give or take any form of bribes or gifts from people.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=182}} Merchants at Ridi in 1829 and [[Tansen, Palpa|Tansen]] in 1830 lost their [[thatched]] shopping houses to fire. The affected merchants demanded individual rights on property and allowance of building concrete shopping houses. He accepted the merchants' proposal of building concrete shopping houses and allowed individual [[property rights|rights on the property]].{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=182}} Due to long ongoing [[Unification of Nepal|unification campaigns of Nepal]], there was anarchy in Nepalese administration before Bhimsen's Mukhtiyari. In [[Achham district|Achham Province]], Zamindars, Amalis, and traders perpetrated great injustice to farmers by increasing heavy interest on loans, to which farmers revolted. Bhimsen being moved by the plight of the victims issued ''Lalmohar'' with binding instructions to write off outstanding dues at once.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=181}}\n\nThe socio-religious customs like birth and death ceremonies among [[Newar]] community was leading to [[indebtedness]]. The priests took up huge ceremonial fees and failure to adhere to such customs led people to excommunication in the Newar society. In 1830\u201331, Bhimsen by issuing ''Lalmohar'', a regulation was introduced with a limit of ceremonial fees and the amount of expenditure was restricted.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|pp=180\u2013181}} The children of debtors were acquired by the traders against the accumulated interest of the loans and were sold on profit. The feudal lords did not allow them legal facilities and considered slaves as non-human. Bhimsen challenged the widespread notion of inhuman treatment of slaves.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=180}} In 1830, Bhimsen having introduced anti-slavery regulations beforehand in 1807,{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=33}} restricted all of the [[Danuwar]] traders in Western Nepal to acquire and sell ''Kariya'' slaves and also freed slaves from the custody of their owner.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|pp=179\u2013180}} The regulation was targeted to provide legal rights to slaves and boost their morale.

The first ''Mukhtiyar'' to title himself as a prime minister, as per the British convention, was Bhimsen's nephew, [[Mathabar Singh Thapa]].{{sfn|Kandel|2011|p=10}}}} (equivalent to prime minister) and de facto ruler of [[Nepal]]<ref name=\"htmilitary\"/> from 1806 to 1837.{{sfn|Whelpton|1991|p=21}}\n\nBhimsen's life is known for his dramatic rise and fall from power. Bhimsen rose to influence after helping the exiled ex-King [[Rana Bahadur Shah]] engineer his return to power in 1804. In gratitude, Rana Bahadur made Bhimsen a ''[[Kaji (Nepal)|Kaji]]'' (equivalent to a minister) of the newly formed government. Rana Bahadur's assassination by his step-brother in 1806 led Bhimsen to massacre ninety-three people, after which he was able to claim the title of the ''[[Mukhtiyar]]'' (equivalent to prime minister). The death of King [[Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah Deva|Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah]] in 1816 at the immature age of 17, with  his heir, King [[Rajendra of Nepal|Rajendra Bikram Shah]] being only 3 years old, along with the support from [[Queen Tripurasundari]] (the junior queen of Rana Bahadur Shah) allowed him to remain in power even after Nepal's defeat in the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]]. After the death of Queen Tripurasundari in 1832 and the adulthood of King [[Rajendra of Nepal|Rajendra]], the conspiracies and infighting with the British envoy [[Brian Houghton Hodgson]], Senior Queen [[Samrajya Laxmi Devi]] and rival courtiers (especially the [[Kala Pandes]], who held Bhimsen Thapa responsible for the death of [[Damodar Pande]] in 1804) finally led to his imprisonment and death by suicide in 1839.\n\nBhimsen's prime ministership is best remembered for the Anglo-Nepalese war. The territorial expanse of the [[Kingdom of Nepal|Gurkha empire]] had reached its greatest extent from [[Sutlej]] river in the west to the [[Teesta River|Teesta]] river in the east. However, Nepal entered into a disastrous Anglo-Nepalese War with the [[East India Company]] lasting from 1814\u201316, which was concluded with the [[Treaty of Sugauli]], by which Nepal lost almost one-third of its land. He is also remembered for bringing about a large number of social, economic, and administrative reforms, as well as the modernization of [[Nepalese Army]] on the template of the [[French Army|French military forces]]. During his lifetime, he commissioned the building of many temples and monuments such as [[Dharahara]] known as ''Bhimsen Stambha'' (\"Bhimsen Tower\").\n\n== Early years ==\n[[File:Nishankalika Flag of Bagale Thapa clan.svg|thumb|upright|Nishankalika flag of [[Bagale Thapa]] clan, Bhimsen's ancestral clan]]\nBhimsen Thapa{{refn|group=note|His given name ''Bhimsen'' is the name of one of the [[Pandava|Pandu princes]] i.e [[Bhimasena]].

The exigencies of [[Sino-Nepalese War]] in 1788\u201392 had forced Bahadur Shah to temporarily take a pro-British stance, which had led to a commercial treaty with the British in 1792.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nMeanwhile, Rana Bahadur Shah's youth had been spent in pampered luxury.

However, in 1804, Garhwal refused to pay the amount upon which Bhimsen sent an army under the command of ''Bada Kaji'' [[Amar Singh Thapa]] (not to be confused with his father), [[Bhakti Thapa]] and [[Hasti Dal Shah]] to attack Garhwal.{{sfn|Stiller|1973|p=228}} The army succeeded in annexing Garhwal to Nepalese territory, thus extending the territory of Nepal up to the Sutlej river in the west.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=83\u201387}} After the annexation of Garhwal, the Nepalese army attacked the fort of Kangra but was defeated by the combined army of [[Sansar Chand]], the ruler of Kangra, and that of [[Ranjit Singh]], the ruler of Punjab.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=87\u2013102}} Other states like Salyan were also annexed to Nepal during his rule.

Furthermore, according to the treaty, Nepal had to allow for the establishment of a permanent British resident in Kathmandu and had to forgo all self-determination in foreign affairs.

As such, Bhimsen had the Samar Jung Company removed from its position of royal palace guard.{{sfn|Acharya|1972|p=166}} Some of the officers and soldiers of the Samar Jung Company were imprisoned, while the remaining personnel were assigned guard duties in common jails as well as monitoring of road construction by convicts. As a further punishment, the Mukhtiyar cancelled their holidays on Saturday, whereas all other companies enjoyed such benefit.{{sfn|Acharya|1972|p=166}} Their ''Devata'' flag carried by ''Nishan'' flag-bearers were also treated with indignity.{{sfn|Acharya|1972|p=166}}\n\n===Hold on power===\n[[Image:Bhimsen-thapa-portrait.jpg|thumbnail|left|Bhimsen Thapa, the Prime Minister of Nepal from 1806 to 1837]]\nIn May 1816, Edward Gardner arrived in Kathmandu as the first British Resident after the conclusion of the Treaty of Sugauli. Bhimsen used all his influence to cultivate peace, although not friendliness, with the British, \"a Power,\" as he said, \"that crushed thrones like potsherds.\"{{sfn|Oldfield|1880|p=299}} His foreign policy after the war was essentially the one handed down by Prithvi Narayan Shah \u2013 to keep Nepal isolated from any foreign influences. As such, although he was forced to accept a British resident in Kathmandu as per the Treaty of Sugauli, he made sure to cut off the resident from all contacts with life in Nepal to the point of making the Resident a virtual prisoner. Apart from petty harassment, the Resident was only allowed to travel within the Kathmandu valley, that too only with special escorts. The resident was also barred from meeting the king or any courtiers at will. Thus the threat of having a Resident in Kathmandu was not as keen as had been anticipated.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=111}}\n\nOn 20 November 1816, King Girvan Yuddha died of smallpox, aged nineteen.{{sfn|Oldfield|1880|p=298}} Girvan had two wives \u2013 the first wife committed sati with Girvan, while the second wife also died of smallpox after 14 days of Girvan's death. Thus, Girvan was succeeded by his only son, [[Rajendra of Nepal|Rajendra Bikram Shah]], an infant of two years old, after 18 days of his father's death on 8 December 1816. Therefore, Bhimsen Thapa, in collusion with the queen regent, Tripurasundari, remained in power despite the defeat of Nepal in the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] of 1814\u201316.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=74\u201375}} There was a sustained opposition against Bhimsen from factions centered around leading members of other aristocratic families, notably the [[Pande family|Pandes]],{{refn|group=note|After the execution of Damodar Pande, some of his sons had managed to escape to India.

Paradoxically, the peacetime after the Anglo-Nepalese War saw the inflation and modernization of the Nepal army, which Bhimsen used to keep his opposition under control,{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=76}} while at the same time convincing the suspicious British that he had no intention of using it against them. Bhimsen appointed his own family members and his most trusted men to the highest positions at the court and in the army, while members of older aristocratic families were made administrators of far-flung provinces of the kingdom, away from the capital.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=77}}\n\nThus, Bhimsen was able to continue making all the administrative decisions of the country, while the Regent Queen Tripurasundari would unquestioningly approve these decisions by stamping the royal seal issued in the name of King Rajendra on these government orders. The Regent never dared to express any doubts regarding Bhimsen's decisions.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=147}} Nevertheless, to make sure that the King, his wives \u2013 Samrajya Laxmi Devi (senior) and Rajya Lakshmi Devi (junior) \u2013 and the Regent were insulated from influences of people other than Bhimsen and his closest relatives, Bhimsen had instated his youngest brother, [[Ranabir Singh Thapa|Ranvir Singh Thapa]], in the royal palace to keep a watch on the royal family and to keep guard against any outside person.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=148}} Any priest or courtier who wished to be granted an interview with the King, the Queens, or the Regent, had to get approval from Ranbir Singh and the interview had to be conducted under his watchful presence.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=148}} Similarly, the royal family was not allowed to leave the palace without Bhimsen's permission either. Bhimsen had also neglected the formal education of Rajendra, due to which he had grown to be uncritical and weak minded to the extent that he was even unaware that he was virtually a prisoner.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=148}} However, his wives were more alert and wary of Bhimsen since, according to [[Baburam Acharya]], they received unfiltered news of the world outside the royal palace from their handmaidens, who would leave the palace compounds and go to their homes during their menstruation and gather news and rumors of the day, which they would then relate to the Queens.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=148\u2013149}}\n\n==Infighting==\n[[File:King Bikram Shah Deva of Nepal.jpg|thumbnail|right|Portrait of Rajendra Bikram Shah.]]\n[[File:A Nepalese Official (Perhaps Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, served 1806-1837) LACMA M.91.206.jpg|right|thumb|Possible portrait of young Bhimsen Thapa]]\n\n===Reasons===\nThe Gorkha aristocracy had led Nepal into a disaster on the international front but preserved the political unity of the country, which at the end of the Anglo-Nepalese War in 1816 still was only about twenty-five years old as a unified nation. The success of the central government rested in part on its ability to appoint and control regional administrators, who also were high officers in the army. In theory, these officials had great local powers; in practice they spent little energy on the daily affairs of their subjects, interfering only when communities could not cope with problems or conflicts. Another reason for Gorkha success in uniting the country was the willingness to placate local leaders by preserving areas where former kings and communal assemblies continued to rule under the loose supervision of Kathmandu, leaving substantial parts of the country out of the control of regional administrators. Even within the areas directly administered by the central government, agricultural lands were given away as ''jagir'' to the armed services and as ''birta'' to court favorites and retired servicemen.{{refn|group=\"note\"|name=\"land ownership\"}} The holder of such grants in effect became the lord of the peasants working there, with little if any state interference.{{sfn|Regmi|1976|p=18}} From the standpoint of the average cultivator, the government remained a distant force, and the main authority figure was the landlord, who took part of the harvest, or (especially in the Tarai) the tax collector, who was often a private individual contracted to extort money or crops in return for a share.{{sfn|Regmi|1976|p=33}} For the leaders in the administration and the army, as military options became limited and alternative sources of employment grew very slowly, career advancement depended less on attention to local conditions than on loyalty to factions fighting at court.{{sfn|Savada|1993}}\n\n===Actors===\nFive leading families or factions contended for power during this period\u2014the [[Shah dynasty|Shahs]], [[Thapa dynasty|Thapas]], [[Basnyat family|Basnyats]], [[Pande family (Nepal)|Pandes]], and the Chautariyas, who were of Shah dynasty but acted as counselors for the King. Working for these families and their factions were hill Brahmans, who acted as religious preceptors or astrologers, and [[Newars]], who occupied secondary administrative positions. No one else in the country had any influence on the central government. When a family or faction achieved power, it killed, exiled, or demoted members of opposing alliances. Under these circumstances, there was little opportunity for either public political life or coordinated economic development.{{sfn|Savada|1993}}{{sfn|Joshi|Rose|1966|pp=23\u201325}}\n\n===Consequences===\nThe struggle for power at the court had unfortunate consequences for both foreign affairs and for internal administration. All parties tried to satisfy the army in order to avoid interference in court affairs by leading commanders, and the military was given a free hand to pursue ever-larger conquests. As long as the Gorkhas were invading disunited hill states, this policy\u2014or lack of policy\u2014was adequate. Inevitably, continued aggression led Nepal into disastrous collisions with the Chinese and then with the British. At home, because power struggles centered on control of the king, there was little progress in sorting out procedures for sharing power or expanding representative institutions. A consultative body of nobles, a royal court called the Assembly of Lords (Bharadari Sabha), was in place after 1770 and it had substantial involvement in major policy issues. The assembly consisted of high government officials and leading courtiers, all heads of important Gorkha families. In the intense atmosphere surrounding the monarch, however, the Assembly of Lords broke into factions that fought for access to the prime minister or regent, and alliances developed around patron/client relationships.{{sfn|Savada|1993}}{{sfn|Joshi|Rose|1966|pp=25\u201327}}\n\n==Downfall: 1832\u20131838==\n[[File:King Rajendra Bikram Shah Deva.jpg|thumb|Portrait of King [[Rajendra Bikram Shah]].]]\n[[File:King Surendra Bikram Shah 1.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of King [[Surendra Bikram Shah]].]]\n\n===Death of Queen Tripurasundari===\nThe power balance began to change after King Rajendra came of age and his grandmother, Tripurasundari, died on 26 March 1832 due to cholera.{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=103}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=149}} Bhimsen lost his main support and the court became a stage for a power struggle, which even though started off as an attempt to assert the King's authority from the ''Mukhtiyar'', spread to various aristocratic clans and their attempt to secure total authority.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|pp=155\u2013156}} However, King Rajendra still feared the ''Mukhtiyar'' and the [[Thapa dynasty|Thapa faction]] as \"...a race of men who for the last fifty-five years have dragged the country and its princes at the wheels of military car.\"{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|pp=155}} It was no secret that Bhimsen was able to maintain his supremacy due to the large standing army under his and his family's command; and in the subsequent years, different factions would attempt to increase their influence based on the strength of the number of battalions under their grip.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|pp=155\u2013156}} After Tripurasundari's death, the royal seal by which government orders were approved naturally went into the hands of the senior queen Samrajya Laxmi, who knew all too well of its powers and wanted to emulate the queens of the past by establishing her own regency.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=149}}{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=156}}\n\nSensing Samrajya Laxmi's ambition, Ranbir Singh started to stroke her dislike of Bhimsen in the hopes of becoming the ''Mukhtiyar'' himself.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=149}} There was a quarrel between Bhimsen's nephew, [[Mathabar Singh Thapa]], and Ranbir Singh regarding the latter's shift of loyalty towards the Senior Queen Samrajya Lakshmi, resulting in Mathabar resigning from the command of Sri Nath Regiment.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=147}} Getting a whiff of this matter, Bhimsen strongly reprimanded Ranbir Singh which caused him to resign from his General's position and live in retirement in his house at Sipamandan.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=149\u2013150}} However, Bhimsen later managed to placate his brother, by giving him the title of Chota (Little) General, and send him to Palpa as its governor.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=151}}{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=148}} To counter the opposition arising in Darbar after the incident, he appointed young Kaji Surath Singh Thapa, a grandson of Bada Kaji [[Amar Singh Thapa]] to a very high administrative position in the Darbar and made him joint chief signatory.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=148}} Since he could find nobody that he could trust to keep watch over the royal palace, Bhimsen from then on started to live in an ordinary rented house located near the palace premise.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=150}}\n\n===Sharing of administrative duties===\nThe King and the Queens also started to openly challenge Bhimsen's authority. By this time, Rajendra and his wives had heard the widespread rumor that Bhimsen, in order to remain in power, had killed the late King Girvan and his wives by administering poison a few days after Girvan's coming off age. So when Rajendra was afflicted by an ordinary illness, the Queens cautioned the King and prohibited him to take the medicine offered by the royal physician, Sardar Ekdev Upadhyay, who was loyal to Bhimsen.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=150}} Similarly, during the annual muster of 1833, during which the civil and military officers were promoted, renewed, retained, or retired, everything was conducted according to Bhimsen's plan, but Rajendra delayed the retainment of Bhimsen's own position as the ''Mukhtiyar''.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=150}}\n\nThis forced Bhimsen to share the administrative burden between Rajendra, Samrajya Laxmi, and himself, and ask for their opinions on administrative matters, in order to reduce further friction between himself and the royalty. Rajendra was put in charge of defense, finance, and foreign relations; while Samrajya Laxmi was put in charge of justice, accountancy, and civil administration.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=152}} Nevertheless, Rajendra's activities were heavily influenced by the advice of Samrajya Laxmi, while the Junior Queen Rajya Laxmi had no say in any matter; furthermore, the King and the Senior Queen did not dare yet to outright dismiss Bhimsen's plans and advice, fearful of the large army under his command.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=152}} This arrangement worked well for the next three years; for instance, on 26 August 1833, Nepal was struck by a great earthquake,{{sfn|Dasgupta|2015|pp=491-513}} and all three power holders were able to coordinate with each other and provide emergency relief to the citizens.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=152}}{{refn|group=note| There were two fore-shocks occurring at 6:30 PM and 11:30 PM, with the main shock, felt around 11:55 PM Calcutta time (10:58 PM Kathmandu time).

It reportedly killed 414 people, wounded 172 people, and destroyed 4040 houses in Nepal.{{sfn|Dasgupta|2015|pp=491-513}}}}\n\n===Mounting frustration of the Senior Queen===\n[[File:Ranabir Singh Thapa.jpg|thumb|[[Ranabir Singh Thapa]]]]\nQueen Samrajya Laxmi was ambitious to show herself as powerful and as independent as her predecessor Queen Tripurasundari.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=156}} Initially, King Rajendra supported Bhimsen instead of [[Ranabir Singh Thapa|Ranbir Singh]] and the removal of Ranabir Singh sabotaged the Queen's plan.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=148}} King Rajendra appointed Bhimsen to the post of [[Commander-In-Chief of the Nepalese Army|Commander-In-Chief]] and praised Bhimsen for his long service to the nation.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=149}} However, Queen Samrajya Laxmi would harass King Rajendra by such words as:\n\n{{Quote|You are an independent Raja indeed. You are a slave of Bhim Sen Thapa.... a sheep led to the slaughter. Has he bewitch you or has he poured lead into your ears rendering you deaf. Let me and my children leave you to the fate your imbecility deserve, or ...you become religious and go to Benaras to bath and pray and leave me without the eldest boy to rule the country and try if a women can succeed where a man has failed in annihilating the [[Thapa family|Thapas]] and asserting the lawful rights of sovereignty among her people.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=149}}}}\n\nQueen Samrajya Laxmi was very frustrated by King Rajendra's failure to remove Bhimsen from power. On 8 November 1835, she caused a turmoil by leaving the Durbar at midnight, angered by King Rajendra's inability to stop Bhimsen from dealings with the Governor General, with whom she felt the King should be  directly dealing with.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|pp=156-157}} Meanwhile, she demanded the King to establish a new regiment; however the King failed to obtain the required financial allocation from the ''Mukhtiyar''. Instead, King Rajendra authorized Bhimsen with a ''Sunnad'' in favour of the ''Mukhtiyar''. Upon learning this, the Queen Samrajya Laxmi shouted angrily at King Rajendra:\n\n{{Quote|You have given him a Sunnad making once for all everything to the Minister, who with his family and creatures will eat up all so that neither have we any right nor any means to provide for our children. You are no Raja, other rule and spend, you have your mere [[throne|gaddi]] and mouthful to eat. Such too is my share and your children.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=157}}}}\n\nShe also demanded an allocation of [[Nepalese Rupee|Rs.]] 50,000 for her children from the [[Terai]] revenues. If her demands were not to be met, she threatened to part from the state affairs. However, despite all her efforts to pressurize King Rajendra, she achieved no success.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=157}}\n\n===Failure of Mathabar Singh Thapa's mission to Britain===\n[[File:Brian Houghton Hodgson by Louisa Starr-Canziani.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Brian Houghton Hodgson]].]]\n[[File:Colonel Mathabar Singh Thapa 1.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Colonel [[Mathabar Singh Thapa]] from 1831]]\nThat same year, [[Brian Houghton Hodgson|Brian Hodgson]], who had spent many years in Nepal serving as the Assistant Resident, and who had a good knowledge about Nepal's biodiversity, culture, and politics, became the new British Resident.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=151}}{{sfn|Rana|1988|p=14}} Although the British Residents were officially instructed to keep out of the internal politics of Nepal, the Resident was courted by both the King as well as the ''Mukhtiyar''. Hodgson was waiting for an opportunity to exploit the rift between the ''Mukhtiyar'' and the royal family and begin a more aggressive campaign to increase British influence and trading opportunities.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=151}}{{sfn|Rana|1988|pp=15\u201316}} Hodgson also believed the large standing army to be a security threat{{sfn|Rana|1988|p=15}} and that the border tensions could be pacified if the King was directly in control, rather than a ''Mukhtiyar'' who needed to keep on the right side of the army.{{sfn|Whelpton|2004|p=27}} By 1834, Hodgson had come to a conclusion that he would not be able to have his way so long as Bhimsen was in control of the Nepalese administration;{{sfn|Rana|1988|p=16}} thus he strongly sympathized with the Pande faction,{{sfn|Whelpton|2004|p=27}} and he wished to install [[Fatte Jang Chautaria|Fateh Jung Shah]], who was more favorably disposed to him, as the ''Mukhtiyar''.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=153}} Hodgson reported to the Government of India on the dominance of Bhimsen over the position of the King as:\n\n{{Quote|the Rajah is surrounded by the Minister's creature and is at present helpless. Bhim Sen has all the powers in his hands...The Rajah is so uncomfortable in his honorary confinement that the probability is the Minister may work on him with success to make voluntary retirement of his throne in favour of his infant son and in the highest conformity with the [[Dharmashastra|sacred code]] of the [[Hindu]], to which His Highness is proved.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=127}}}}\n\nIn August 1834, Hodgson proposed to conduct a new commercial treaty between Nepal and Britain, which Bhimsen in principle agreed to but disagreed with several of the clauses.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=153}}{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=104}}{{sfn|Rana|1988|p=17}} At a time when his authority was diminishing, Bhimsen could not afford to antagonize the Resident; but at the same time, he could not accept his proposals and be seen as subservient to the British by the Nepalese court. Nevertheless, he tried to maintain a friendly and conciliatory attitude toward the Resident, in order to win him as his ally, by loosening the restrictions on his movements and granting direct access to the King.{{sfn|Rana|1988|p=18}}\n\nIn the meantime, a royal letter was received from the Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]], ruler of [[Sikh Empire]] in Punjab, addressed to King Rajendra. The Nepalese court seized this opportunity to re-establish diplomatic contact with Punjab as well as other states such as [[Burma]] and [[Gwalior]].{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=152}} In April 1835, Bhimsen also hatched a plan to make a state visit to Britain, hoping to force Britain to acknowledge the sovereignty of Nepal; but since he could not make the visit himself, his nephew Colonel [[Mathabarsingh Thapa|Mathabar Singh Thapa]] was chosen as the representative of Nepal, bearing a few gifts and a letter from King Rajendra addressed to [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]].{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=104}}{{sfn|Rana|1988|p=18}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=152\u2013153}} The idea was initially received favorably by Hodgson as well as the Governor-General, who hoped that the mission could increase the trust between the two nations.{{sfn|Rana|1988|p=18}} In this process, Mathabar Singh was promoted to Chota General; his brother, Ranbir Singh, the governor of Palpa, was made Full General; and Mathabar's nephew, the sixteen-year-old Sher Jung Thapa, was made Commanding Colonel. Thus, Bhimsen managed to consolidate his military powers.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=152\u2013153}} Both Rajendra and Samrajya Laxmi were also pleased with this plan, and on 1 November 1835, Bhimsen was conferred the title of [[Commander-In-Chief of the Nepalese Army|Commander-in-Chief]].{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=153}}{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=104}} On 27 November 1835, Mathabar Singh left Kathmandu with a retinue of two thousand men, including 200 officers and 600 soldiers, for London via Calcutta.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=153}}{{sfn|Rana|1988|p=19}}\n\nMathabar was given a grand welcome in Calcutta by the acting Governor-General [[Charles Metcalfe, 1st Baron Metcalfe|Charles Metcalfe]]; and while there, Mathabar started to indulge in needless luxuries and show offs.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=153\u2013154}} Meanwhile, Hodgson sent a secret letter to Metcalfe asking him not to allow Mathabar to make a state visit to Britain.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=154}} Hence, Metcalfe was only willing to grant him the visa of an ordinary traveler, and not the diplomatic visa of a state representative. Mathabar thus returned to Nepal in March 1836, having wasted a vast sum of money, without accomplishing any of his goals.{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=104}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=154}} The deliberate sabotage of Mathabar's mission was Hodgson's diplomatic attack against Bhimsen.{{sfn|Rana|1988|p=19}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=154}} Until that time, it was widely believed by both the royal family as well as the common people that Bhimsen's good relationship with the high ranking British officials, since he was the only one allowed to communicate with them, was responsible for preventing the East India Company to take full control of Nepal. The mission's failure unambiguously revealed to everyone that this was not the case, and severely undermined Bhimsen's political credibility.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=154}} Mathabar Singh spent a sum of one lakh and fifty thousand in Calcutta on the fruitless mission.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=150}} Mathabar's extravagant expenditure was also heavily criticized by Samrajya Laxmi, since at that time the state coffer was in dire condition; and to pacify her, Bhimsen had to reimburse the extra expenses from his own pockets.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=156}}\n\n===Rise of the [[Kala Pandes]]===\n[[File:Ranajang_Pande.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of [[Ranajang Pande]].]]\nBy this time, [[Rana Jang Pande|Ranajang Pande]], the youngest son of [[Damodar Pande]], was stationed as a captain in the army in Kathmandu. He was aware of the disunity between Samrajya Laxmi and Bhimsen, and thus he had secretly expressed his loyalty to Samrajya Laxmi and had vowed to help her in bringing Bhimsen down for all the wrongs he had committed against his family.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=155}} In November 1834, Ranajang requested to the King for the restoration of his family properties and honors, to which the King of Nepal favorably received the request.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=158}} Assistant British Resident J.R. Tickell wrote that: {{Quote|From that day may be reckoned, the commencement of a counter-revolution and of those intrigues of the [[Kala Pandes]] which eventually succeeded so well in overthrowing of their rivals and in repaying the cruelties that they themselves suffered at his [Bhimsen's] hands.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=158}}}} Ranajang also tried to communicate with the Chinese [[Amban]] in [[Lhasa]] to restore his family connections with Tibet and falsely tagged Bhimsen being inclined to the enemy of China i.e. the British.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=158}}{{refn|group=note|In reply, the Chinese Amban wrote to the King of Nepal to depute Ranajang in the next quinquennial mission to [[Peking]]; however, the King deputed [[Chautariya Pushkar Shah|Pushkar Shah]].{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|pp=158-159}}}} Factions in the Nepalese court had also started to develop around the rivalry between the two queens, with the Senior Queen supporting the Pandes, while the Junior Queen supporting the Thapas.{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=108}} About a month after Mathabar's return to Kathmandu, a child was born out of an adulterous relationship between him and his widowed sister-in-law. This news was spread all over the country by the Pandes, and the resulting public disgrace forced Mathabar to leave Kathmandu and reside in his ancestral home in Pipal Thok, Borlang, Gorkha.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=155}} To save face, Bhimsen gave Mathabar the governorship of Gorkha.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=155}}\n\nTaking advantage of Mathabar's absence in Kathmandu, the military battalions under his command were distributed to other courtiers during the annual muster at the beginning of 1837.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=156}} Nevertheless, Bhimsen managed to secure his and his family members' positions in the civil and military offices. An investigation was also started to check Bhimsen's expenditures in establishing various battalions.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=156}} Such events led the courtiers to feel that Bhimsen's ''Mukhtiyari'' would not last very long; thus Ranbir Singh, in the hopes of becoming the next ''Mukhtiyar'', wrote a letter to the King asking him to be recalled to Kathmandu from Palpa. His wish was granted; and Bhimsen, pleased to see his brother after many years, made Ranbir Singh the acting ''Mukhtiyar'' and decided to go to his ancestral home in Borlang Gorkha for the sake of pilgrimage.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=157}} But in truth, Bhimsen had gone to Gorkha to placate his nephew and bring him back to Kathmandu.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=157}}\n\nIn Bhimsen's absence, King Rajendra established a new battalion, ''Hanuman Dal'', to be kept under his personal command. By February 1837, both Ranajang and his brother, Ranadal Pande, had been promoted to the position of a ''kaji''; and Ranajang was made a personal secretary to the King, while Ranadal Pande was made the governor of Palpa.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=158}} Ranjang was also made the chief palace guard, the position formerly occupied by Ranbir Singh and then Bhimsen. Thus, this curtailed Bhimsen's access to the royal family.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=158}} On 14 June 1837, the King took over the command of all the battalions put in charge of various courtiers, and himself became the Commander-in-Chief.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=215}}{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=105}}\n\n===Poisoning case===\nOn 24 July 1837, Rajendra's youngest son, Devendra Bikram Shah, an infant of six months, died suddenly.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=158}}{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=105}} It was at once rumored that the child had died of poison intended for his mother the Senior Queen Samrajya Laxmi Devi: given at the instigation of Bhimsen, or someone of his faction.{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=105}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=159}}{{sfn|Whelpton|2004|pp=28\u201329}} On this charge, Bhimsen, his brother Ranbir Singh, his nephew Mathbar Singh, their families, the court physicians, [[Sardar]] Ekdev and Eksurya Upadhyay, and his deputy Bhajuman Baidya, with a few more of the nearest relatives of the Thapas were incarcerated, proclaimed outcasts, and their properties confiscated.{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=105}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=159}}{{sfn|Acharya|1971a|p=13}}{{sfn|Oldfield|1880|p=310}} The physicians Ekdev and Eksurya, being Brahmins, were severely tortured but spared, while Bhajuman Baidya was impaled and killed.{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=106}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=160}}{{refn|group=note|Historian [[Baburam Acharya]] writes that Bhajuman Baidya confessed that he treated the young prince with the medicine provided by Ekadev Baidya under torture.

Except for Mathabar Singh, who managed to escape to India, rest of the Thapa family were again arrested, their properties confiscated, were declared outcasts, and were proclaimed to be expelled from every public office for seven generations.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=164}}{{sfn|Acharya|1971a|p=13}}{{sfn|Oldfield|1880|p=316}}\n\nWhile under house arrest, Bhimsen smuggled a letter to the Resident Hodgson appealing him to intervene on his behalf, which Hodgson refused at that moment but sought permission from his superiors to do so.{{sfn|Whelpton|2004|p=29-30}} Bhimsen was given brutal treatment at the orders of Rana Jang during the arrest. Rana Jang did not choose direct assassination of Bhimsen but some strong calculated savage measures to make Bhimsen commit suicide.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=168}} One of the savage measures was that the false rumours on the method of punishment to Bhimsen was circulated every day.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=168}} Meanwhile, Bhimsen's third wife, Bhakta Kumari, happened to insult the Senior Queen Samrajya Laxmi, who upon hearing about this insult, was so angered that she order Bhakta Kumari to be removed from Bagh Durbar and put in a common jail.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=164}} After this, a rumor started to spread around Kathmandu that Bhakta Kumari would be stripped off her clothes and paraded through the streets of the city.{{sfn|Oldfield|1880|p=316}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=164}}{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=168}} This rumor also fell on Bhimsen's ears; and unable to bear such indignity, Bhimsen attempted suicide by slitting his throat with a [[khukuri]] on 28 July 1839.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=164}} The news of this attempted suicide further angered the King and the Queen, who came to look at his body, and instead of feeling sympathy for the old minister and ordering immediate medical care, Bhimsen's blood-soaked, unconscious body was ordered that same day to be dragged through the streets and dumped by the same bank of Bishnumati river, where Bhimsen had dumped the dead bodies of 45 people 33 years ago during the Bhandarkhal massacre.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=165}} Bhimsen finally died nine days later, surrounded by vultures, jackals, and dogs, on 5 August 1839, at the age of 64.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=165}} Since suicide was considered a grave crime, soldiers were stationed at his death spot so that his body would not be removed and given ordinary cremation rites; and his body was allowed to be devoured by scavenging animals.{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=111}}{{sfn|Oldfield|1880|p=316}}{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=165}} On the spot where Bhimsen drew his last breath, a Shiva temple by the name Bhim-Mukteshwar was later constructed by his nephew Mathabar Singh Thapa.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=166}}\n\nWhile there is a general consensus on the cause and circumstances of Bhimsen's death, there is a disagreement on the exact date of his death. Baburam Acharya contends that Bhimsen attempted suicide on 28 July in his house and died nine days later on 5 August by the banks of Bishnumati;{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=165}} while Henry Oldfield, [[Kumar Pradhan|K.L. Pradhan]], and Gyanmani Nepal contend that the suicide was attempted on 20 July and the death occurred nine days later on 28 July in his house, only after which his dead body was disposed by the banks of Bishnumati.{{sfn|Oldfield|1880|p=316}}{{sfn|Nepal|2007|p=111}}{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=168}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Mathabar Singh Thapa portrait.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Mukhtiyar [[Mathabar Singh Thapa]].]]\n[[File:Sir Jang Bahadur Kunwar Rana (1850).jpg|thumb|right|[[Jang Bahadur Kunwar Rana]] in a portrait of 1850.]]\nThe death of Bhimsen Thapa did not resolve the factional fighting at court. Five months after Bhimsen's death, Ranajang Pande was again made prime minister; but Ranajang's inability to control the general lawlessness in the country forced him to resign from prime minister's office, which was then conferred on Puskar Shah, based on Samrajya Laxmi's recommendation.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=167}} While Pushkar Shah was not as anti-British as Ranajang Pande, he was nevertheless unfavorably predisposed towards them. During his tenure, a border dispute with the British in April 1840 resulted in Governor-General of India, [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland|1st Earl of Auckland]] dispatching some troop near the Nepalese border once again, which Pushkar managed to resolve diplomatically.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=167\u2013168}} There was also a brief army mutiny in June 1840, as a reaction against the government's attempt to cut military salary, during which houses of several noblemen in favor of this unpopular act were vandalized and burned. The mutiny was calmed only after King Rajendra publicly agreed not to implement the reform.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=168\u2013169}} Taking advantage of this mutiny, Resident [[Brian Houghton Hodgson|Hodgson]] sent an incriminating report against the Nepalese government to his superiors in Calcutta. The Governor-General demanded the King to dissolve the incumbent government and appoint ministers more favorable towards the British. Thus, Pushkar Shah and his Pande associates were dismissed, and Fateh Jang Shah was appointed the Prime Minister in November 1840.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|p=170}} Dismissal of Pushkar Shah curtailed Samrajya Laxmi's power. When Rajendra refused to abdicate in favor of their eldest son [[Surendra of Nepal|Surendra]], the heir apparent, she left Kathmandu and settled at a border town in Terai. However, during the monsoon season, Samrajya Laxmi was afflicted with malaria from which she died in October 1841 at the age of twenty-seven.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=171\u2013172}}\n\nThe death of the Senior Queen Samrajya Laxmi allowed the emergence of the Junior Queen Rajya Laxmi and Crown Prince Surendra onto the political stage. To consolidate her political influence and see her own son, rather than the heir apparent, Surendra, succeed on the throne, Rajya Laxmi had obtained pardon for Sher Jung Thapa and other jailed members of Thapa family. It was only after this that Bhimsen Thapa managed to get a symbolic funeral rite in August 1841.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=172\u2013174}} Thus, the Nepalese court was split into three factions centered around the King, the Queen, and the Crown Prince. Fateh Jung and his administration supported the King, the [[Thapa dynasty|Thapas]] supported the Junior Queen, while the [[Pande family|Pandes]] supported the Crown Prince. The resurgent Thapa coalition succeeded in sowing animosity between Fateh Jung's ministry and the Pande coalition, who were swiftly imprisoned.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=173\u2013176}} During his two years in power, Fateh Jung was able to maintain a rule of law in the country; however, after the incarceration of the Pandes, nobody could rein in the worsening sadistic tendencies, sometimes with fatal consequences, of Surendra, who was then still a minor.{{refn|group=note| Whelpton: \"In May 1842 the Residency diary records that one of Surendra's wives, a girl of only nine years, died after he had made her stand all day in a tank of water at the palace.\"{{sfn|Whelpton|2004|p=32}} }} Under immense pressure from the Queen and the nobility, along with the backing from army and the general populace, the King in January 1843 handed the highest authority of the state to his Junior Queen, Rajya Laxmi, curtailing both his own and his son's power.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=176\u2013177}}{{sfn|Whelpton|2004|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nThe Queen, seeking the support of her own son's claims to the throne over those of Surendra, invited Mathabar Singh Thapa back after almost six years in exile.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=177\u2013178}} Upon his arrival in Kathmandu, an investigation of his uncle's death took place, and a number of his Pande enemies were massacred.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=179\u2013181}} As for Ranajang Pande, he had by that time contracted mental illness and would not have posed any threat to Mathabar. Nevertheless, Ranajang was paraded through the streets and made to witness the execution of his family members, after which he was forced to commit suicide by poison.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=179\u2013181}} By December 1843, Mathabar Singh was appointed prime minister; but after a year in power, he alienated both the King and the Queen by supporting Surendra's claim over the throne. On 17 May 1845, he was assassinated, on both the King and Queen's orders, by his nephew, [[Jang Bahadur|Jang Bahadur Kunwar]]. The death of Mathabar Singh ended the Thapa hegemony and set the stage for [[Kot massacre]] and the establishment of [[Rana Dynasty]], a dictatorship of hereditary prime ministers, which was founded on the basic template provided by Bhimsen Thapa. These events provided the long period of stability the country needed but at the cost of political and economic development.{{sfn|Acharya|2012|pp=11\u201312}}\n\n==Reforms and Heritages==\n===Reforms===\n[[File:Picture of bhimsen thapa standing beside a horse.jpg|thumb|Picture of Bhimsen Thapa standing beside a horse in the reformed Nepalese military uniforms designed from [[French military]] uniform]] \nBhimsen implemented the reorganization of [[Nepalese Army]] on the basis of European military system and the maintenance of the newly reorganized strong army was done from the confiscation of ''Birta'' funds of 1805.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=29}} He appointed French military officials to modernize the military on the basis of [[French military]] ranks and uniforms. Military jobs were made attractive by increasing facilities including ''Jhara'' (porter) facility even in the peacetime under his ''Mukhtiyari''.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=29}} Due to extensive lack of labour forces in the country, he issued legal obligations to all adult males of all castes to provide compulsory labour to the state subject to royal exemptions. Those state jobs included construction and maintenance of forts, bridges, roads, and production of ammunition for military expeditions.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|pp=29\u201330}} ''Hulaki'' (postal) system from Kathmandu to the western front was implemented on 1804 through rotational [[relay]]s of [[porters]]. In 1808 during the premiership of Bhimsen, it was reported that minors were engaged in Hulaki services in the villages with small Hulaki households. The regulation issued by Bhimsen's government was to increase the number of relays in the villages consisting low Hulaki households and person forcing minors and females for personal Hulaki services would be severely punished.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=30}} These Jhara (porter) services for Hulaki system were regularly required due to which some were compensated with land under ''Adhiya'' (half-ownership) tenure and others in the form of cash wages compensation.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=31}} Regulations issued in July 1809 was:\n{{Quote|In the areas west of [[Dharmasthali]] (in Kathmandu) and east of [[Bheri River]], inspect whether or not Hulaki outposts for transport or mail have been established as mentioned in the previous order. According to this order, Hulaki porters had been granted a 50 percent concession in the Walak levies, in addition to full exemption from (other) compulsory labour obligations and taxes on their homesteads...<br> In areas west of Bheri river and east of [[Yamuna River|Jamuna river]], make an estimate of the amount required for payment to Hulaki porters employed for the transport of mail on the basis of sum sanctioned in the previous order and the sum required according to arrangements made this year for different areas and submit a report accordingly.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=31}}}}\n\nIn 1807 dealing with [[slavery]], the government of Bhimsen directed revenue officials to collect outstanding taxes and fines in terms of cash and ordered the freedom of all enslaved farmers in case of defaulting taxes and no farmer would be enslaved for non-payment of taxes. In 1812, he imposed a general restriction on [[human trafficking]] in [[Garhwal region|Garhwal]] Sirmur and other areas.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=33}} Around 1808, Bhimsen ordered the reclamation of wastelands in [[Terai]] region for increasing state revenue and offered irrigation facilities to settlers reclaiming the wastelands.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|pp=33\u201334}} In places where there was a lack of tenants, farmers were allocated the wastelands with tax exemption and loan was provided for new incoming settlers. The wastelands reclamation policy was largely advantageous to the government and tenants, and was greatly successful in Eastern Terai.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|pp=33\u201334}} For the coordination of this policy, officials were appointed all over the state in 1811.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=34}} The trade policy of Bhimsen Thapa was influenced from King [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] who believed foreign (in the context English) traders would weaken the economy of the country and impoverish the general people. Customs offices were relocated within the country to reduce discomfort to native traders. Essential arrangements and facilities were provided to native traders and officials were warned not to intimidate native traders.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=34}} Bhimsen is quoted to have said: {{Quote|If Tibetans and Firangis [i.e. foreigners or, in the contemporary context, Englishmen] meet and trade with each other, our ryots and traders will lose their employment and result will not be good.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=35}}}} After 1807, markets were opened in the Terai and [[Inner Terai]] under direct governmental efforts and supervision to facilitate native traders. For instances; in 1809, market towns were made at Hitaruwa in Makawanpur and at Bhadaruwa in Saptari.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=35}} Indian traders were also encouraged to trade within the country{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=34}} and Nepalese officials were instructed to take care of the development of border markets, [[land reclamation]] and settlement, and protection of land encroachment.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=35}} In 1811, timber exports from Chitwan to Calcutta were introduced together with the diversification of agricultural products to strengthen the export. Also, mining and [[minting coins]] were undertaken by the Bhimsen government.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=35}} Bhimsen considered [[Sivalik Hills|Churia hills]] as the basic line of defense of the [[Kingdom of Nepal]]. He thus wanted to build communications to the western parts such as [[Kumaon region|Kumaon]], [[Garhwal region|Garhwal]] and [[Yamuna]]-[[Sutlej]] region of Kingdom of Nepal and block the strategic routes to the [[Kathmandu valley]].{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|pp=35\u201336}} The possessions of passers-by were strictly searched and even private letters were censored. Such was implemented to prevent outflow of secret information of Nepal to [[British East India Company|British Company government]].{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=184}} [[Passport]] system was introduced to check the access to the capital city with officials appointed on the Churai routes with instructions as follows: {{Quote|In case you permit any person, irrespective of his status, leaving this side to proceed onward even though he does not have (a document bearing) signature of passports authority. We shall behead you.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=36}}}} \nBhimsen put forth the principle of [[Equality before the law]] in Nepal. In 1826, a regulation was issued by him through ''Lalmohar'' (Red Seal) of [[Maharaja]] directing Kaji [[Dalbhanjan Pande]] to maintain the sanctity of judiciary and it further stated:\n{{Quote|irrespective of castes, creeds or position in the society, all are same in the eyes of law.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=184}}}} ''Mohi'' ([[tenant farmer]]s) felt it easier to pay taxes in kind to their [[Zamindars]] due to cash shortage. He directed the [[Zamindars]] to accept foodgrain as tax and not to harass the farmers. The regulation further directed that it was the responsibility of Zamindars to make arrangements for cash and not of the farmers.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=182}} The [[anti-bribery]] regulations were issued due to reports of Zamindars, Amalis, and regional officials taking up bribery from people in the far-flung provinces. Bhimsen through his regulations declared it illegal to give or take any form of bribes or gifts from people.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=182}} Merchants at Ridi in 1829 and [[Tansen, Palpa|Tansen]] in 1830 lost their [[thatched]] shopping houses to fire. The affected merchants demanded individual rights on property and allowance of building concrete shopping houses. He accepted the merchants' proposal of building concrete shopping houses and allowed individual [[property rights|rights on the property]].{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=182}} Due to long ongoing [[Unification of Nepal|unification campaigns of Nepal]], there was anarchy in Nepalese administration before Bhimsen's Mukhtiyari. In [[Achham district|Achham Province]], Zamindars, Amalis, and traders perpetrated great injustice to farmers by increasing heavy interest on loans, to which farmers revolted. Bhimsen being moved by the plight of the victims issued ''Lalmohar'' with binding instructions to write off outstanding dues at once.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=181}}\n\nThe socio-religious customs like birth and death ceremonies among [[Newar]] community was leading to [[indebtedness]]. The priests took up huge ceremonial fees and failure to adhere to such customs led people to excommunication in the Newar society. In 1830\u201331, Bhimsen by issuing ''Lalmohar'', a regulation was introduced with a limit of ceremonial fees and the amount of expenditure was restricted.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|pp=180\u2013181}} The children of debtors were acquired by the traders against the accumulated interest of the loans and were sold on profit. The feudal lords did not allow them legal facilities and considered slaves as non-human. Bhimsen challenged the widespread notion of inhuman treatment of slaves.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=180}} In 1830, Bhimsen having introduced anti-slavery regulations beforehand in 1807,{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=33}} restricted all of the [[Danuwar]] traders in Western Nepal to acquire and sell ''Kariya'' slaves and also freed slaves from the custody of their owner.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|pp=179\u2013180}} The regulation was targeted to provide legal rights to slaves and boost their morale. Six years afterward, he restricted ban on sales of children prevalent among [[Magars|Magar community]] of Marsyangdi and Western Pyuthan.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=180}} The [[slave trading]] was made illegal on various parts of Nepal by Bhimsen. It was considered one of the greatest achievement in the history on comparison to their British counterparts. [[William Wilberforce|Wilberforce]] in England was obtaining the public mandate against it while one of the most powerful Prime Minister in the world (in the 1800s) \u2013 [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]] was hesitant to outlaw the [[slave trading]].{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=180}}\n\n===Heritages built===\nIn 1811, he built the bridge at Thapathali over [[Bagmati River]] connecting strategically significant cities; [[Kathmandu]] and [[Patan, Nepal|Patan]].{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=185}} In 1825, he built the famous [[Dharahara]] Tower on the orders of then reigning [[Queen Tripurasundari of Nepal]]. Beforehand, he had already built the taller antecedent of Dharahara for himself on 1824. The taller Dharahara collapsed on 1833 Nepal earthquake and was never repaired.

His contemporary King [[Rana Bahadur Shah]] of Nepal had told that {{Quote|''If I die the nation will not die, but if Bhimsen dies the nation will collapse.''{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=189}}}} Similarly, British writer and journalist [[Perceval Landon]] had told {{Quote|''Nepal is Bhimsen and Bhimsen is Nepal.''{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=189}}}}\n\nHistorian [[Baburam Acharya]] considered Bhimsen to be a nationalist with personal interest and a very cruel temperament.{{sfn|Acharya|1972|pp=166-167}} He termed Bhimsen as a [[military dictator]] who had control over 6000 armed forces.{{sfn|Acharya|1974|p=214}} However, historian [[Kumar Pradhan]] asserts that Bhimsen could not be termed as military dictator because he was dependent on [[Pajani System]] (annual renewal) for renewal of his every tenure of office.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=184}} Pradhan also asserts that Bhimsen did not manipulate [[Nepal Army|the Army]] which could be seen when he was not backed up by any soldiers after his removal from Mukhtiyarship.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=185}} Pradhan asserts that administrative system of Nepal was people-centric and upward mobility. Most of the [[Thapa Kaji|Thapa Bharadars (courtiers)]] were appointed before 1816 and there was no monopoly of any single family in the inner circle of court.{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=187}} Similarly, Pradhan explains that there was no monopoly of Bhimsen because the regulations were all issued in the name of [[Maharaja]].{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=176}}\n\n[[Perceval Landon]] had also expressed the bitterness of Bhimsen's death in the quote: {{Quote|''His was a life of contrast and no Greek tragedy has ever presented a more dramatic catastrophe than his fearful end.''{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=177}}}} German philosopher and historian [[Karl Marx]] quoted that\n{{Quote|''Bhimsen was the only man in Asia who braved to protest submission to colonists.''{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=189}}}} An English writer remarked about him as; {{Quote|''He was the first Nepalese statesman who grasped the meaning of the system of protectorate which [[Lord Wellesley]] had carried out in India. He saw one native state after another came within the net of British Subsidiary Alliance and his policy was steadily directed to save Nepal from a similar fate.''{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=24}}}}\n\nHistorian Nayaraj Panta considered that Bhimsen's action to suppress British influences on Nepal and strengthening of Nepalese military forces was important to save the fate of the only [[Hindu]] Kingdom in the world.{{sfn|Panta|1975|p=235}} Historian Ludwig Stiller considered Bhimsen to be \"..a very clever statesman but he was not an economist by any means.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.recordnepal.com/podcast/the-downfall-of-bhimsen-thapa/ | title=The Record - the downfall of Bhimsen Thapa|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190110135612/https://www.recordnepal.com/podcast/the-downfall-of-bhimsen-thapa/|archive-date=10 January 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Nepalese-Canadian essayist [[Manjushree Thapa]] had written a column about him.

It was created by [[Simon Wheeler]] and stars [[Stephen Fry]] as Peter Kingdom, a [[Norfolk]] [[solicitor]] who is coping with family, colleagues, and the strange locals who come to him for legal assistance. The series also starred [[Hermione Norris]], [[Celia Imrie]], [[Karl Davies]], [[Phyllida Law]] and [[Tony Slattery]].\n\nThe first series of six one-hour episodes was aired in 2007 and averaged six million viewers per week. Despite a mid-series ratings dip, the executive chairman of ITV praised the programme and ordered a second series, which was filmed in 2007 and broadcast in January and February 2008. Filming on the third series ran from July to September 2008 for broadcast from 7 June 2009.\n\nStephen Fry announced in October 2009 that ITV was cancelling the series, a fact later confirmed by the channel, which said that given tighter budgets, more expensive productions were being cut.<ref>{{cite news|author= Steve Busfield|title= ITV axes Stephen Fry's Kingdom|url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/oct/09/stephen-fry-kingdom-itv|work= The Guardian|date= 2009-10-09|accessdate= 2009-10-09 | location=London}}</ref>\n\n==Series synopses==\n{{see also|List of Kingdom (British TV series) episodes}}\n\nThe series follows Peter Kingdom, a small-town solicitor whose work revolves around cases brought by the eclectic and eccentric populace of Market Shipborough. The series retains a largely episodic format, where self-contained plots play out before the hour concludes, though a continuing storyline concerns the mysterious disappearance of Simon Kingdom, Peter's half-brother. The first episode reveals that he vanished at sea six months previously and that everybody who knew him (including Peter) assumed that he committed [[suicide]]. Each week there are further indications that he did not die, culminating in episode six when it is revealed that he had a relationship with a woman who become pregnant with his child after he had supposedly died. In the first series we are also introduced to Peter's half-sister, Beatrice, who slowly becomes an integral character in the series.\n\nSimon returns in the second series with his son Daniel, and is charged with faking his own death. He is released from custody after Lyle uses Simon's own money to bail him, and when Simon reveals he was actually attempting suicide. Beatrice learns that she is pregnant, so she leaves Market Shipborough until the baby is born in the last episode of the series. Lyle threatens to leave Kingdom & Kingdom when his mentor Peter begins to neglect him, but he changes his mind when Peter makes him a partner. In the final episode, a torrential storm hits Market Shipborough, flooding much of the town. While searching for his brother, who drove off the previous night, Peter encounters something unseen by the audience, which is revealed to be Simon's dead body in Series 3.\n\nSeries 3 largely steps away from Simon as we are now aware that he has died. Instead, this series focuses more on Peter's life, Beatrice and her new baby (Petra), Lyle, and Gloria, the receptionist. Toward the end of the series Peter begins to suffer from small blackouts. He has some minor tests done to find out the cause of the problem. It is revealed in the last episode that Peter has Type 2 diabetes. When Peter asks the doctor whether he should tell Beatrice and Petra to get checked out, the doctor revealed that diabetes isn't the only thing they discovered. In the final scenes Peter reveals that he has found out that he has no blood relation to Beatrice or Simon, and that therefore \"their\" father was not in fact ''his'' father.\n\n==Characters==\n[[File:Sidney Snell.jpg|thumb|right|Tony Slattery (right) as Sidney Snell during filming of the second series in 2007. To emphasise the character's unkempt nature, his costume is rarely changed.]]\nThe characters are described by Wheeler as \"three families\"; Peter's relations, his colleagues, and the populace of Market Shipborough.<ref name=\"dsannouncement\"/>\n* '''Peter Kingdom''' (played by '''[[Stephen Fry]]''') is [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]]-educated  solicitor and one half of Kingdom & Kingdom, a law firm he ran with his father. Peter is respected and regarded as compassionate by the local community. Fry describes him as \"kind and empathetic\", \"on the side of the ordinary people\"<ref name=\"homeandfry\"/> and as being \"lonely and isolated\" and not revealing his true emotions.<ref name=\"behindthescenes\"/> Phyllida Law describes Peter as \"into the community like one of those old French village priests\".<ref>{{cite news|first=Tony |last=Padman |title=Phyllida enjoys home comforts in her West Hampstead kingdom |url=http://woodandvale.london24.net/woodandvale/whatson/story.aspx?brand=NorthLondon24&category=whatsonfeatures&tBrand=northlondon24&tCategory=whatson&itemid=WeED30%20May%202007%2014%3A38%3A33%3A030 |work=Ham and High: Wood and Vale edition |date=2007-05-30 |accessdate=2007-06-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010031250/http://woodandvale.london24.net/woodandvale/whatson/story.aspx?brand=NorthLondon24&category=whatsonfeatures&tBrand=northlondon24&tCategory=whatson&itemid=WeED30%20May%202007%2014%3A38%3A33%3A030 |archivedate=10 October 2007 }}</ref>\n* '''Beatrice Kingdom''' (played by '''[[Hermione Norris]]''') is Peter's half-sister, who arrives in the first episode after leaving rehabilitation. She is described by Wheeler as intended to be the \"ultimate annoying little sister\".<ref name=\"behindthescenes\"/> By series two, she is successfully controlling her mental illness with medication and has become more responsible and reliable. Norris's second pregnancy (with her daughter, Hero) was worked into the series storyline; Beatrice is portrayed as promiscuous in the first series and takes several pregnancy tests in the second series, which all come up positive. Beatrice goes into labour in episode five of the second series and asks Simon to be present at the birth. The identity of Petra's father is initially not known, and Simon tells Peter he \"will totally flip\" when he finds out. It is later revealed her father is a local philandering judge.  Petra is played by twin girls in the third series. Their mother answered a casting call for young twins in a local newspaper.<ref>{{cite news|author= Staff|title= Norfolk twins star in Kingdom TV show|url= http://new.edp24.co.uk/content/news/story.aspx?brand=EDPOnline&category=News&tBrand=EDPOnline&tCategory=News&itemid=NOED19%20Sep%202008%2008%3A15%3A02%3A000|work= Eastern Daily Press|date= 2008-09-19|accessdate= 2008-10-14|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081023140525/http://new.edp24.co.uk/content/news/story.aspx?brand=EDPOnline&category=News&tBrand=EDPOnline&tCategory=News&itemid=NOED19%20Sep%202008%2008%3A15%3A02%3A000|archivedate= 23 October 2008|df= dmy-all}}</ref>\n* '''Lyle Anderson''' (played by '''[[Karl Davies]]''') is a trainee solicitor at Kingdom & Kingdom during the first series. At the end of the second series, he qualifies, and is offered and accepts a partnership in the practice. Lyle is a somewhat comic character often having bad luck, whether he misses out on a potential relationship or gets hit by a golf ball. The writers created a running joke for the character, where he gets wet in almost every episode, from falling in swimming pools to landing in dikes.\n* '''Gloria Millington''' (played by '''[[Celia Imrie]]''') is a legal secretary who is recovering from the death of her husband a year before the first series.<ref name=\"localhero\">{{cite news |last= McClure|first= Richard|title= Local hero|work= [[What's on TV]]|date= 21\u201327 April 2007|page= 13 }}</ref> She has a young son (played by [[Angus Imrie]], the actress's son) and is \"the sister he (Peter) deserved\" but never had.<ref name=\"behindthescenes\"/> Gloria is antagonised by Beatrice during the first series, but the two become friends after a day out together.\n* '''Sidney Snell''' (played by '''[[Tony Slattery]]''') is a smelly local and a frequent client of Peter who often finds ways to sue the local council. Slattery described Snell as an \"everyman anti-hero\", with Wheeler calling him an \"unlikely guardian of Market Shipborough\" on account of his numerous attempts to stop building work.<ref name=\"behindthescenes\"/> Snell develops a close friendship with the recently widowed Gloria in the first series. To emphasise his unwashed state, the wardrobe department rotated Snell's costume only once in the first series.<ref name=\"behindthescenes\"/>\n* '''Aunt Auriel''' (played by '''[[Phyllida Law]]''') is Peter's aunt and confidante. She lives in a retirement home on a large country estate.\n* '''Nigel Pearson''' (played by '''[[John Thomson (comedian)|John Thomson]]''') is introduced in the second series as the captain of Market Shipborough's cricket team. Peter investigates Nigel after discovering he has not honoured sponsorship contracts made with several local businesses. Nigel confides in Peter that his marriage is breaking down - his wife (played by Rachel Fielding) is having an affair with Simon, and he returns the money owed. Nigel returns as a regular cast member in the third series, now working as a relationship counsellor.<ref name=\"s3 start\">{{cite news|title=Stephen Fry returns to his Kingdom |url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/news/3570 |work=[[What's on TV]] |date=2008-07-01 |accessdate=2008-07-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001084619/http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/news/3570 |archivedate=1 October 2011 }}</ref>\n* '''Simon Kingdom''' (played by '''[[Dominic Mafham]]''') was an unseen character (with the exception of some photographs) in the first series, with the final episode revealing that he had fled to [[Dublin]], apparently to escape large debts. In the second series, he returns to Market Shipborough with his baby son, Daniel, and is charged with faking his own death. Simon has a reputation as a ne'er-do-well, and usually behaves in a self-centered and womanising manner. At the end of the second series, he disappears after fleeing from a Mafia-type gang during a storm. It is revealed at the start of series three that he now really is dead, with the opening scene showing Peter, Beatrice and Auriel standing at his grave.\n\n[[Tom Fisher (actor)|Thomas Fisher]] plays Ted, a local yokel who is the landlord of the local pub and a friend of Sidney Snell. [[Gerard Horan]] plays DC Yelland, who is in charge of prosecuting the Simon Kingdom case but also sometimes appears on other matters. Both Ted and Yelland's roles are expanded in the second series. In the first series, Maryann Turner plays a recurring minor character referred to only as \"Mrs Thing\", whom Peter is constantly trying to avoid. Simon's pregnant partner, Honor O'Sullivan (played by [[Kelly Campbell (actress)|Kelly Campbell]]), is introduced in the final episode of the first series. By the second series she has given birth to baby Daniel and is living with Beatrice and Peter, where she develops an attraction to Lyle. She leaves after Simon returns.\n\nGuest appearances in the first series are made by [[Richard Wilson (Scottish actor)|Richard Wilson]] (as Peter's old university tutor in episode four), [[Robert Bathurst]] (as a cross-dressing husband in episode five), [[Lynsey De Paul]] as Sheila Larsen, who drowns in her own swimming pool, [[Joss Ackland]] (as an [[Auschwitz]] survivor in episode six), and [[Rory Bremner]] (as a vicar, also in episode six).<ref name=\"dsseriestwo\"/> Bremner, known more for satire than acting, has joked that he played the vicar \"as\" [[Michael Howard]] and [[Rowan Williams]] and that his character's name was \"Jane\", due to an error in the script.<ref name=\"behindthescenes\"/> Wilson returned for the second series, which also includes roles by [[Lucy Benjamin]] and [[Richard Briers]], and [[Diana Quick]].

It was created by [[Simon Wheeler]] and stars [[Stephen Fry]] as Peter Kingdom, a [[Norfolk]] [[solicitor]] who is coping with family, colleagues, and the strange locals who come to him for legal assistance. The series also starred [[Hermione Norris]], [[Celia Imrie]], [[Karl Davies]], [[Phyllida Law]] and [[Tony Slattery]].\n\nThe first series of six one-hour episodes was aired in 2007 and averaged six million viewers per week. Despite a mid-series ratings dip, the executive chairman of ITV praised the programme and ordered a second series, which was filmed in 2007 and broadcast in January and February 2008. Filming on the third series ran from July to September 2008 for broadcast from 7 June 2009.\n\nStephen Fry announced in October 2009 that ITV was cancelling the series, a fact later confirmed by the channel, which said that given tighter budgets, more expensive productions were being cut.<ref>{{cite news|author= Steve Busfield|title= ITV axes Stephen Fry's Kingdom|url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/oct/09/stephen-fry-kingdom-itv|work= The Guardian|date= 2009-10-09|accessdate= 2009-10-09 | location=London}}</ref>\n\n==Series synopses==\n{{see also|List of Kingdom (British TV series) episodes}}\n\nThe series follows Peter Kingdom, a small-town solicitor whose work revolves around cases brought by the eclectic and eccentric populace of Market Shipborough. The series retains a largely episodic format, where self-contained plots play out before the hour concludes, though a continuing storyline concerns the mysterious disappearance of Simon Kingdom, Peter's half-brother. The first episode reveals that he vanished at sea six months previously and that everybody who knew him (including Peter) assumed that he committed [[suicide]]. Each week there are further indications that he did not die, culminating in episode six when it is revealed that he had a relationship with a woman, and that she had become pregnant with his child after he had supposedly died. In the first series we are also introduced to Peter's half-sister, Beatrice, who slowly becomes an integral character in the series.\n\nSimon returns in the second series with his son Daniel, and is charged with faking his own death. He is released from custody after Lyle uses Simon's own money to bail him, and when Simon reveals he was actually attempting suicide. Beatrice learns that she is pregnant, so she leaves Market Shipborough until the baby is born in the last episode of the series. Lyle threatens to leave Kingdom & Kingdom when his mentor Peter begins to neglect him, but he changes his mind when Peter makes him a partner. In the final episode, a torrential storm hits Market Shipborough, flooding much of the town. While searching for his brother, who drove off the previous night, Peter encounters something unseen by the audience, which is revealed to be Simon's dead body in Series 3.\n\nSeries 3 largely steps away from Simon as we are now aware that he has died. Instead, this series focuses more on Peter's life, Beatrice and her new baby (Petra), Lyle, and Gloria, the receptionist. Toward the end of the series Peter begins to suffer from small blackouts. He has some minor tests done to find out the cause of the problem. It is revealed in the last episode that Peter has Type 2 diabetes. When Peter asks the doctor whether he should tell Beatrice and Petra to get checked out, the doctor revealed that diabetes isn't the only thing they discovered. In the final scenes Peter reveals that he has found out that he has no blood relation to Beatrice or Simon, and that therefore \"their\" father was not in fact ''his'' father.\n\n==Characters==\n[[File:Sidney Snell.jpg|thumb|right|Tony Slattery (right) as Sidney Snell during filming of the second series in 2007. To emphasise the character's unkempt nature, his costume is rarely changed.]]\nThe characters are described by Wheeler as \"three families\"; Peter's relations, his colleagues, and the populace of Market Shipborough.<ref name=\"dsannouncement\"/>\n* '''Peter Kingdom''' (played by '''[[Stephen Fry]]''') is [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]]-educated  solicitor and one half of Kingdom & Kingdom, a law firm he ran with his father. Peter is respected and regarded as compassionate by the local community. Fry describes him as \"kind and empathetic\", \"on the side of the ordinary people\"<ref name=\"homeandfry\"/> and as being \"lonely and isolated\" and not revealing his true emotions.<ref name=\"behindthescenes\"/> Phyllida Law describes Peter as \"into the community like one of those old French village priests\".<ref>{{cite news|first=Tony |last=Padman |title=Phyllida enjoys home comforts in her West Hampstead kingdom |url=http://woodandvale.london24.net/woodandvale/whatson/story.aspx?brand=NorthLondon24&category=whatsonfeatures&tBrand=northlondon24&tCategory=whatson&itemid=WeED30%20May%202007%2014%3A38%3A33%3A030 |work=Ham and High: Wood and Vale edition |date=2007-05-30 |accessdate=2007-06-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010031250/http://woodandvale.london24.net/woodandvale/whatson/story.aspx?brand=NorthLondon24&category=whatsonfeatures&tBrand=northlondon24&tCategory=whatson&itemid=WeED30%20May%202007%2014%3A38%3A33%3A030 |archivedate=10 October 2007 }}</ref>\n* '''Beatrice Kingdom''' (played by '''[[Hermione Norris]]''') is Peter's half-sister, who arrives in the first episode after leaving rehabilitation. She is described by Wheeler as intended to be the \"ultimate annoying little sister\".<ref name=\"behindthescenes\"/> By series two, she is successfully controlling her mental illness with medication and has become more responsible and reliable. Norris's second pregnancy (with her daughter, Hero) was worked into the series storyline; Beatrice is portrayed as promiscuous in the first series and takes several pregnancy tests in the second series, which all come up positive. Beatrice goes into labour in episode five of the second series and asks Simon to be present at the birth. The identity of Petra's father is initially not known, and Simon tells Peter he \"will totally flip\" when he finds out. It is later revealed her father is a local philandering judge.  Petra is played by twin girls in the third series. Their mother answered a casting call for young twins in a local newspaper.<ref>{{cite news|author= Staff|title= Norfolk twins star in Kingdom TV show|url= http://new.edp24.co.uk/content/news/story.aspx?brand=EDPOnline&category=News&tBrand=EDPOnline&tCategory=News&itemid=NOED19%20Sep%202008%2008%3A15%3A02%3A000|work= Eastern Daily Press|date= 2008-09-19|accessdate= 2008-10-14|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081023140525/http://new.edp24.co.uk/content/news/story.aspx?brand=EDPOnline&category=News&tBrand=EDPOnline&tCategory=News&itemid=NOED19%20Sep%202008%2008%3A15%3A02%3A000|archivedate= 23 October 2008|df= dmy-all}}</ref>\n* '''Lyle Anderson''' (played by '''[[Karl Davies]]''') is a trainee solicitor at Kingdom & Kingdom during the first series. At the end of the second series, he qualifies, and is offered and accepts a partnership in the practice. Lyle is a somewhat comic character often having bad luck, whether he misses out on a potential relationship or gets hit by a golf ball. The writers created a running joke for the character, where he gets wet in almost every episode, from falling in swimming pools to landing in dikes.\n* '''Gloria Millington''' (played by '''[[Celia Imrie]]''') is a legal secretary who is recovering from the death of her husband a year before the first series.<ref name=\"localhero\">{{cite news |last= McClure|first= Richard|title= Local hero|work= [[What's on TV]]|date= 21\u201327 April 2007|page= 13 }}</ref> She has a young son (played by [[Angus Imrie]], the actress's son) and is \"the sister he (Peter) deserved\" but never had.<ref name=\"behindthescenes\"/> Gloria is antagonised by Beatrice during the first series, but the two become friends after a day out together.\n* '''Sidney Snell''' (played by '''[[Tony Slattery]]''') is a smelly local and a frequent client of Peter who often finds ways to sue the local council. Slattery described Snell as an \"everyman anti-hero\", with Wheeler calling him an \"unlikely guardian of Market Shipborough\" on account of his numerous attempts to stop building work.<ref name=\"behindthescenes\"/> Snell develops a close friendship with the recently widowed Gloria in the first series.

She lives in a retirement home on a large country estate.\n* '''Nigel Pearson''' (played by '''[[John Thomson (comedian)|John Thomson]]''') is introduced in the second series as the captain of Market Shipborough's cricket team. Peter investigates Nigel after discovering he has not honoured sponsorship contracts made with several local businesses. Nigel confides in Peter that his marriage is breaking down - his wife (played by Rachel Fielding) is having an affair with Simon, and he returns the money owed.

In the second series, he returns to Market Shipborough with his baby son, Daniel, and is charged with faking his own death. Simon has a reputation as a ne'er-do-well, and usually behaves in a self-centered and womanising manner. At the end of the second series, he disappears after fleeing from a Mafia-type gang during a storm. It is revealed at the start of series three that he now really is dead, with the opening scene showing Peter, Beatrice and Auriel standing at his grave.\n\n[[Tom Fisher (actor)|Thomas Fisher]] plays Ted, a local yokel who is the landlord of the local pub and a friend of Sidney Snell. [[Gerard Horan]] plays DC Yelland, who is in charge of prosecuting the Simon Kingdom case but also sometimes appears on other matters. Both Ted and Yelland's roles are expanded in the second series. In the first series, Maryann Turner plays a recurring minor character referred to only as \"Mrs Thing\", whom Peter is constantly trying to avoid. Simon's pregnant partner, Honor O'Sullivan (played by [[Kelly Campbell (actress)|Kelly Campbell]]), is introduced in the final episode of the first series. By the second series she has given birth to baby Daniel and is living with Beatrice and Peter, where she develops an attraction to Lyle. She leaves after Simon returns.\n\nGuest appearances in the first series are made by [[Richard Wilson (Scottish actor)|Richard Wilson]] (as Peter's old university tutor in episode four), [[Robert Bathurst]] (as a cross-dressing husband in episode five), [[Lynsey De Paul]] as Sheila Larsen, who drowns in her own swimming pool, [[Joss Ackland]] (as an [[Auschwitz]] survivor in episode six), and [[Rory Bremner]] (as a vicar, also in episode six).<ref name=\"dsseriestwo\"/> Bremner, known more for satire than acting, has joked that he played the vicar \"as\" [[Michael Howard]] and [[Rowan Williams]] and that his character's name was \"Jane\", due to an error in the script.<ref name=\"behindthescenes\"/> Wilson returned for the second series, which also includes roles by [[Lucy Benjamin]] and [[Richard Briers]], and [[Diana Quick]].

He was formerly Co-founder and CEO at Solar Notion, Inc., a privately held company in [[Silicon Valley]], set out to achieve [[grid parity]] for PV electricity through a radically new silicon process technology.\n\nDr. Nikoonahad was involved with a number of start-up, private, and public companies at the executive level, all in the high technology arena. He was formerly Vice President of Technology for Strategic Business Development at [[KLA-Tencor]] (KT) Corporation focusing on [[merger and acquisitions]] (M&A) and investment activity in the areas of equipment for [[microelectromechanical systems]](MEMS), [[optical communication]] devices, magnetic media inspection and [[metrology]], and for [[semiconductor manufacturing]]. He joined Tencor Instruments in Mountain View, California in 1992 when he proposed and helped develop a platform for a high-speed, [[laser]]-based, wafer inspection system, which, then for the first time, addressed the inspection needs for 0.25 micrometre [[semiconductor device fabrication]] technology during high volume production.  That platform was subsequently named Advanced Inspection Technology (AIT) and during its peak times generated over $1 billion in revenue. Dr. Nikoonahad then managed development groups and extended that capability for smaller silicon geometries, using [[ultraviolet]] lasers. Subsequent to the AIT, he led numerous development teams for inspection and metrology products used in silicon manufacturing.  Laser imaging, metals and [[dielectric]] thin film metrology, laser and spectral [[ellipsometry]] for dielectric film characterization, photothermal ellipsometry for implant measurement, [[chemical-mechanical planarization]] (CMP) end-point detection, optical CD (OCD), overlay characterization, and micro/macro defect inspection are among some the technologies that Dr. Nikoonahad and his teams have developed. He was Vice President of Technology for a new division of KT focused on integrated meteorology. He was also held an advisory role for the KT Venture Fund and was a member of the corporate Patent Review Committee. He was the winner of numerous innovation and patent awards while at KT.\n\nPrior to KT he was at [[Philips]] research labs in [[Briarcliff Manor, New York]] where he served as Senior Member Technical Staff and led research on acoustic imaging, and [[medical ultrasound]].

He was formerly Co-founder and CEO at Solar Notion, Inc., a privately held company in [[Silicon Valley]], set out to achieve [[grid parity]] for PV electricity through a radically new silicon process technology.\n\nDr. Nikoonahad was involved with a number of start-up, private, and public companies at the executive level, all in the high technology arena. He was formerly Vice President of Technology for Strategic Business Development at [[KLA-Tencor]] (KT) Corporation focusing on [[merger and acquisitions]] (M&A) and investment activity in the areas of equipment for [[microelectromechanical systems]](MEMS), [[optical communication]] devices, magnetic media inspection and [[metrology]], and for [[semiconductor manufacturing]]. He joined Tencor Instruments in Mountain View, California in 1992 when he proposed and helped develop a platform for a high-speed, [[laser]]-based, wafer inspection system, which, then for the first time, addressed the inspection needs for 0.25 micrometre [[semiconductor device fabrication]] technology during high volume production.  That platform was subsequently named Advanced Inspection Technology (AIT) and during its peak times generated over $1 billion in revenue. Dr. Nikoonahad then managed development groups and extended that capability for smaller silicon geometries, using [[ultraviolet]] lasers. Subsequent to the AIT, he led numerous development teams for inspection and metrology products used in silicon manufacturing.  Laser imaging, metals and [[dielectric]] thin film metrology, laser and spectral [[ellipsometry]] for dielectric film characterization, photothermal ellipsometry for implant measurement, [[chemical-mechanical planarization]] (CMP) end-point detection, optical CD (OCD), overlay characterization, and micro/macro defect inspection are among some the technologies that Dr. Nikoonahad and his teams have developed. He was Vice President of Technology for a new division of KT focused on integrated meteorology. He was also held an advisory role for the KT Venture Fund and was a member of the corporate Patent Review Committee. He was the winner of numerous innovation and patent awards while at KT.\n\nPrior to KT he was at [[Philips]] research labs in [[Briarcliff Manor, New York]] where he served as Senior Member Technical Staff and led research on acoustic imaging, and [[medical ultrasound]]. Dr. Nikoonahad has been [[principal investigator]] on a number R&D projects for the US [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) and the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH).\n\nHe has authored or coauthored over 50 scientific papers, including a book chapter and is a named inventor on over 100 US [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=0&p=1&f=S&l=50&Query=in%2Fnikoonahad&d=PTXT patents] and [http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&r=0&p=1&f=S&l=50&Query=in%2Fnikoonahad&d=PG01 patent applications].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nikoonahad, Mehrdad}}\n[[Category:American chief executives of energy companies]]\n[[Category:21st-century American engineers|Nikooonahad, Mehrdad]]\n[[Category:Iranian engineers|Nikooonahad, Mehrdad]]\n[[Category:American people of Iranian descent|Nikooonahad, Mehrdad]]\n[[Category:Living people|Nikooonahad, Mehrdad]]\n[[Category:Senior Members of the IEEE|Nikooonahad, Mehrdad]]\n[[Category:Stanford Graduate School of Business alumni|Nikooonahad, Mehrdad]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n", "name_user": "Ajdarc", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCareer and business interests", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehrdad_Nikoonahad"}
