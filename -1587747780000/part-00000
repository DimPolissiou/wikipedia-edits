She campaigned against [[social liberalism]] and the mainstream British media, both of which she accused of encouraging a more [[permissive society]]. She was the founder and first president of the [[Mediawatch-UK|National Viewers' and Listeners' Association]], through which she led a longstanding campaign against the [[BBC]]. A hard-line [[Social conservatism|social conservative]], she was disparagingly termed a [[reactionary]] by her socially liberal opponents. Her motivation derived from her traditional [[Christianity|Christian]] beliefs, her aversion to the rapid social and political changes in British society of the 1960s and her work as a teacher of sex education.<ref name=\"LA Times\">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/nov/26/local/me-8356|title=Mary Whitehouse, 91; Led British TV Cleanup|work=Los Angeles Times|date=26 November 2001|accessdate=5 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306230659/http://articles.latimes.com/2001/nov/26/local/me-8356|archive-date=6 March 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nBorn in [[Nuneaton]], [[Warwickshire]], Whitehouse became an art teacher, at the same time becoming involved in evangelical Christian groups such as the [[Student Christian Movement of Great Britain|Student Christian Movement]] (which became increasingly more liberal leading up to and after a 1928 split with the [[Universities and Colleges Christian Fellowship]]) and [[Moral Re-Armament]]. She became a public figure via the Clean-Up TV pressure group, established in 1964, in which she was the most prominent figure. The following year she founded the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association, using it as a platform to criticise the BBC for what she perceived as a lack of accountability, and excessive use of bad language and portrayals of sex and violence in its programmes. As a result, she became an object of mockery in the media.\n\nDuring the 1970s she broadened her activities, and was a leading figure in the [[Nationwide Festival of Light]], a Christian campaign that gained mass support for a period. She initiated a successful private prosecution against ''[[Gay News]]'' on the grounds of [[blasphemous libel]], the first such case for more than 50 years. Another private prosecution was against the director of the play ''[[The Romans in Britain]]'', which had been performed at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]].\n\nWhitehouse's campaigns continue to divide opinion. Her critics have accused her of being a highly censorious figure, and her traditional moral convictions brought her into direct conflict with advocates of the [[sexual revolution]], [[feminism]], [[Children's rights#Opposition|children's rights]] and [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|gay rights]]. Others see her more positively and believe she was attempting to halt a decline in what they perceived as Britain's moral standards. According to Ben Thompson, the editor of an anthology of Whitehouse-related letters published in 2012: \"From ... feminist anti-pornography campaigns to the executive naming and shaming strategies of [[UK Uncut]], her ideological and tactical influence has been discernible in all sorts of unexpected places in recent years.\"<ref name=\"Thompson\">Ben Thompson [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/093c3726-24e1-11e2-86fb-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2Bv5X3utv \"Ban this filth!\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112141447/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/093c3726-24e1-11e2-86fb-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2Bv5X3utv#axzz2Bv5X3utv |date=12 November 2012 }}, ''Financial Times'', 9 November 2012.

A hard-line [[Social conservatism|social conservative]], she was disparagingly termed a [[reactionary]] by her socially liberal opponents.

She became a public figure via the Clean-Up TV pressure group, established in 1964, in which she was the most prominent figure. The following year she founded the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association, using it as a platform to criticise the BBC for what she perceived as a lack of accountability, and excessive use of bad language and portrayals of sex and violence in its programmes. As a result, she became an object of mockery in the media.\n\nDuring the 1970s she broadened her activities, and was a leading figure in the [[Nationwide Festival of Light]], a Christian campaign that gained mass support for a period. She initiated a successful private prosecution against ''[[Gay News]]'' on the grounds of [[blasphemous libel]], the first such case for more than 50 years. Another private prosecution was against the director of the play ''[[The Romans in Britain]]'', which had been performed at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]].\n\nWhitehouse's campaigns continue to divide opinion. Her critics have accused her of being a highly censorious figure, and her traditional moral convictions brought her into direct conflict with advocates of the [[sexual revolution]], [[feminism]], [[Children's rights#Opposition|children's rights]] and [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|gay rights]]. Others see her more positively and believe she was attempting to halt a decline in what they perceived as Britain's moral standards.

The new construction of Inholland on Zeeburgereiland is the result of the fact that the location in Diemen has reached the end of its lifespan. But also because the municipality of Amsterdam has indicated that it would like to see Hogeschool Inholland operate in and from the city. The relocation gives the university of applied sciences a recognizable position in the city of Amsterdam and a good profile in the city and region.

For example, NEWb and Rookie Entertainment are student-run companies for our music and media students. Here they learn how to produce a radio or TV show, do market research, create a promotional campaign or organise an event. In Delft, Inholland Composites offers Aeronautical Engineering students an opportunity to gain practical and theoretical knowledge on advanced composite materials.\n\n[[Bachelor's degree]]s at Inholland University of Applied Sciences demand three or four years of full-time study and require 240 European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) credits. One [[ECTS grading scale|ECTS]] credit represents 28 hours of full-time study and the study/workload for one academic year accounts for 60 credits.The Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders ([[Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders|NVAO]]) approves study programs offered by [[Dutch universities]]. All international bachelor's programs offered by Inholland University of Applied Sciences are recognised by [[Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders|NVAO]].\n\n'''Internships'''\n\nDuring their studies, all Inholland students are required to do at least one internship (one semester in the third academic year). Internships, or\u00a0 work placements, can be done in the Netherlands or abroad, and the choice upon the company is generally done by students themselves, but supervised and approved by the university. Specific requirements may vary according to the study programme.\n\nDuring the internship students are supervised by one university lecturer or coach, and one company employee.\n\nThese internships are useful for building a professional network and gaining work experience directly on the field.

For Inholland, international mobility is a tool in order to reach that goal. Currently Inholland is actively part of the Erasmus and exchange program.  This allows students to obtain credits at Inholland that count towards their degree at their home institution. It is an excellent way to experience a different education system and to broaden students\u2019 international outlook.\n\nWith approximately 190 partner universities in Europe, and few others overseas (Australia, China, South Korea, Argentina, just to name a few), Inholland\u2019s students are given the opportunity of studying abroad for one semester in the third year, by maintaining the same tuition fees that in The Netherlands.\n\nAlternatively, students can choose to stay at Inholland and take part in one of many academic minors offered by each study programme.\n\nEach year more than 300 students and 60 teachers take part in the exchanges, and at the same time, Inholland\u2019s locations welcome over 200 students from partner universities around the world.\n\nPartner universities differ based on faculty and course.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{in lang|en}} [https://www.inholland.nl/inhollandcom/ Official website]\n\n{{Dutch Vocational Universities}}\n\n{{coord missing|Netherlands}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Vocational universities in the Netherlands]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Dutch university with eight campuses}}\n{{Infobox university\n| name = Inholland University of Applied Sciences\n| native_name = Hogeschool Inholland\n| image = Short logo.png\n| caption = \n| motto = Leren = durven\n| mottoeng = Learning = being courageous\n| established = 1 September 2002 - mergers of higher vocational education institutions in the provinces of North and South Holland\n| type = University of Applied Sciences\n| chairperson = Jet de Ranitz\n| students = 37,000; 6000 international students\n| city = [[The Hague]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Haarlem]], [[Alkmaar]], [[Delft]], [[Diemen]], [[Dordrecht]], [[Rotterdam]]\n| province = [[South Holland]]\n| country = [[Netherlands]]\n| campus = Multiple campuses\n| colours = {{color box|#E10075}} [[Magenta]]\n| website = {{URL|https://www.inholland.nl/}}\n| logo = [[File:Inholland University black.png|thumb|Inholland University black]]\n}}\n[[File:Hogeschool-inholland-delft.jpg|thumb|Inholland Delft Campus]]\n'''Inholland University of Applied Sciences''' ({{Lang-nl|Hogeschool Inholland}}; {{Lang-fr|Universit\u00e9 des sciences appliqu\u00e9es d'Inholland}}; {{Lang-de|Hochschule Inholland}}) is a [[university]] of applied sciences with its campuses located in 8 different cities<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.inholland.nl/locaties/|title=Locaties - Hogeschool Inholland - Hbo-opleidingen|website=www.inholland.nl|language=nl|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref> placed throughout the western [[Netherlands]] with an education campus in every main city of the [[Randstad]] \u2013 the country's economic, political and cultural hub.

Research universities are essentially accountable for offering research-oriented programs, while universities of applied sciences offer courses that focus on the practical application of arts and sciences with the main focus on real-life practice and career preparation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.studyinholland.nl/dutch-education/dutch-higher-education|title=Dutch education|last=Nuffic|date=2012-04-12|website=Study in Holland|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> \n\nBetween 2007 and 2010, the chairman of the Executive Board was Geert Dales. In the period 2010 to December 2014, the position was filled by Doekle Terpstra.

The new construction of Inholland on Zeeburgereiland is the result of the fact that the location in Diemen has reached the end of its lifespan. But also because the municipality of Amsterdam has indicated that it would like to see Hogeschool Inholland operate in and from the city. The relocation gives the university of applied sciences a recognizable position in the city of Amsterdam and a good profile in the city and region. The study programs from Amsterdam and Diemen will soon come together at one location.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.inholland.nl/nieuws/nieuwbouw-amsterdam-bestemmingsplan-sluisbuurt-vastgesteld/|title=Nieuwbouw Amsterdam: bestemmingsplan Sluisbuurt vastgesteld|website=Nieuwbouw Amsterdam: bestemmingsplan Sluisbuurt vastgesteld|language=nl|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\n== Organization and activities ==\nWorking in the pattern of applied sciences, Inholland University of Applied Sciences has several in-house learning companies where students conduct projects within a particular industry, often on behalf of a company, institution or governmental agency. For example, NEWb and Rookie Entertainment are student-run companies for our music and media students. Here they learn how to produce a radio or TV show, do market research, create a promotional campaign or organise an event. In Delft, Inholland Composites offers Aeronautical Engineering students an opportunity to gain practical and theoretical knowledge on advanced composite materials.\n\n[[Bachelor's degree]]s at Inholland University of Applied Sciences demand three or four years of full-time study and require 240 European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) credits. One [[ECTS grading scale|ECTS]] credit represents 28 hours of full-time study and the study/workload for one academic year accounts for 60 credits.The Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders ([[Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders|NVAO]]) approves study programs offered by [[Dutch universities]]. All international bachelor's programs offered by Inholland University of Applied Sciences are recognised by [[Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders|NVAO]].\n\n=== '''Internships''' ===\nDuring their studies, all Inholland students are required to do at least one internship (one semester in the third academic year). Internships, or\u00a0 work placements, can be done in the Netherlands or abroad, and the choice upon the company is generally done by students themselves, but supervised and approved by the university. Specific requirements may vary according to the study programme.\n\nDuring the internship students are supervised by one university lecturer or coach, and one company employee.\n\nThese internships are useful for building a professional network and gaining work experience directly on the field. Inholland is committed to protect its students during the work placements experience by monitoring its development and quality in rapport to the study career.\n\n== Faculties ==\nThe [[degree programs]] of Inholland University of Applied Sciences are divided into faculties.

For Inholland, international mobility is a tool in order to reach that goal. Currently Inholland is actively part of the Erasmus and exchange program.  This allows students to obtain credits at Inholland that count towards their degree at their home institution. It is an excellent way to experience a different education system and to broaden students\u2019 international outlook.\n\nWith approximately 190 partner universities in Europe, and few others overseas (Australia, China, South Korea, Argentina, just to name a few), Inholland\u2019s students are given the opportunity of studying abroad for one semester in the third year, by maintaining the same tuition fees that in The Netherlands.\n\nAlternatively, students can choose to stay at Inholland and take part in one of many academic minors offered by each study programme.\n\nEach year more than 300 students and 60 teachers take part in the exchanges, and at the same time, Inholland\u2019s locations welcome over 200 students from partner universities around the world.\n\nPartner universities differ based on faculty and course.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{in lang|en}} [https://www.inholland.nl/inhollandcom/ Official website]\n\n{{Dutch Vocational Universities}}\n\n{{coord missing|Netherlands}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Vocational universities in the Netherlands]]\n", "name_user": "Adrianvanrein", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inholland_University_of_Applied_Sciences"}

In [[RNA]], thymine is replaced with [[uracil]] in most cases.  In DNA, thymine (T) binds to [[adenine]] (A) via two hydrogen bonds, thereby stabilizing the nucleic acid structures.\n\nThymine combined with [[deoxyribose]] creates the [[nucleoside]] [[deoxythymidine]], which is synonymous with the term [[thymidine]]. Thymidine can be phosphorylated with up to three phosphoric acid groups, producing [[dTMP]] ('''d'''eoxy'''t'''hymidine '''m'''ono'''p'''hosphate), [[dTDP]], or [[dTTP]] (for the '''d'''i- and '''t'''ri- phosphates, respectively).\n\nOne of the common mutations of DNA involves two adjacent thymines or cytosine, which, in presence of [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet light]], may form [[thymine dimers]], causing \"kinks\" in the DNA molecule that inhibit normal function.\n\nThymine could also be a target for actions of 5-[[fluorouracil]] (5-FU) in [[cancer]] treatment. 5-FU can be a metabolic analog of thymine (in DNA synthesis) or uracil (in RNA synthesis).  Substitution of this analog inhibits [[DNA replication|DNA synthesis]] in actively dividing cells.\n\nThymine bases are frequently oxidized to [[hydantoin]]s over time after the death of an organism.<ref>Hofreiter M., Serre D., Poinar H.N., Kuch M., and Paabo S.

[[China|People's Republic of China]]. It is located on the southern estuary of the [[Yangtze]], with the [[Huangpu River]] flowing through it. With a population of 24.28 million {{as of|2019|lc=y}}, it is the [[List of cities in China by population and built-up area|most populous urban area in China]] and the second [[List of largest cities|most populous city proper]] in the world. Shanghai is a global center for finance, [[Science and technology in China|innovation]] and [[Transport in China|transportation]] and the [[Port of Shanghai]] is the [[world's busiest container port]].\n\nOriginally a fishing village and market town, Shanghai grew in importance in the 19th century due to trade and its favorable port location. The city was one of five [[treaty ports]] forced open to foreign trade after the [[First Opium War]]. The [[Shanghai International Settlement]] and the [[Shanghai French Concession|French Concession]] were subsequently established. The city then flourished, becoming a primary commercial and financial hub of the [[Asia-Pacific]] region in the 1930s. During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], the city was the site of the major [[Battle of Shanghai]]. After the war, with the [[Chinese Civil War|CPC takeover of mainland China]] in 1949, trade was limited to other socialist countries and the city's global influence declined.\n\nIn the 1990s, [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms]] introduced by [[Deng Xiaoping]] resulted in an intense redevelopment of the city, especially the [[Pudong]] district, aiding the return of finance and foreign investment to the city. The city has since re-emerged as a hub for international trade and finance; it is the home of the [[Shanghai Stock Exchange]], one of the [[List of stock exchanges|largest stock exchanges in the world]] by market capitalization and the [[Shanghai Free-Trade Zone]], the first [[free-trade zone]] in China.\n\nShanghai has been described as the \"showpiece\" of the booming [[economy of China]]. Featuring several architecture styles such as [[Art Deco]] and [[shikumen]], the city is renowned for its [[Lujiazui]] [[List of tallest buildings in Shanghai|skyline]], museums and historic buildings\u2014including the [[City God Temple of Shanghai|City God Temple]], [[Yu Garden]], the [[China Pavilion]] and buildings along [[the Bund]]. Shanghai is also known for its [[Shanghai cuisine|sugary cuisine]], [[Shanghainese|distinctive dialect]] and vibrant international flair. Every year, the city hosts numerous national and international events, including [[Shanghai Fashion Week]], the [[Chinese Grand Prix]] and [[ChinaJoy]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe two [[Chinese character]]s in the city's name are {{zh|c={{linktext|\u4e0a}} |labels=no}} ({{transl|zh|sh\u00e0ng}}/''zan'', \"upon\") and {{zh|c={{linktext|\u6d77}} |labels=no}} ({{transl|zh|h\u01cei}}/''hae'', \"sea\"), together meaning \"Upon the Sea\". The earliest occurrence of this name dates from the 11th-century [[Song dynasty]], when there was already a river confluence and a town with this name in the area. How the name should be understood has been disputed, but Chinese historians have concluded that during the [[Tang dynasty]], the area of modern-day Shanghai was under the sea level, so the land appeared to be literally \"on the sea\".<ref name=\"Danielson, Eric N. 2004, pp.8-9\">Danielson, Eric N., ''Shanghai and the Yangzi Delta'', 2004, pp.&nbsp;8\u20139.</ref>\nShanghai is officially abbreviated {{zh|s={{linktext|\u6caa}} |labels=no}}{{efn|Traditional Chinese: {{lang|zh-hant|\u6eec}}<ref>{{Cite web|script-title=zh:\u6559\u80b2\u90e8\u91cd\u7de8\u570b\u8a9e\u8fad\u5178\u4fee\u8a02\u672c|url=http://dict.revised.moe.edu.tw/cgi-bin/cbdic/gsweb.cgi?ccd=jhLPR1&o=e0&sec=sec1&op=v&view=1-1|accessdate=29 September 2019|author=National Academy for Educational Research|date=|format=|work=dict.revised.moe.edu.tw|publisher=|language=zh|author-link = National Academy for Educational Research}}</ref>}} ({{transl|zh|H\u00f9}}/''Vu''<sup>2</sup>) in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], a contraction of {{zh|s={{linktext|\u6caa\u6e0e}} |labels=no}}{{efn|Traditional Chinese: {{lang|zh-hant|\u6eec\u7006}}<ref>{{Cite web |script-title=zh:\u6eec\u7006\u8a5e\u8a9e\u89e3\u91cb / \u6eec\u7006\u662f\u4ec0\u9ebd\u610f\u601d|url=http://www.chinesewords.org/dict/178009-179.html|accessdate=29 September 2019|author=|date=|format=|work=www.chinesewords.org|publisher=\u6f22\u8a9e\u7db2|language=zh|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190929063643/http://www.chinesewords.org/dict/178009-179.html|archive-date=29 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>}} ({{transl|zh|H\u00f9 D\u00fa}}/''Vu Doh'', \"[[Harpoon]] Ditch\"), a 4th- or {{nowrap|5th-century}} [[Jin Dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin]] name for the mouth of [[Suzhou Creek]] when it was the main conduit into the ocean.<ref name=\"Shenhu Origin\">{{cite web |url = http://www.shanghai.gov.cn/shanghai/node2314/node3766/node3767/node3768/index.html |script-title=zh:\"\u7533\",\"\u6caa\"\u7684\u7531\u6765 |publisher=Shanghai Municipal People's Government |language=zh-Hans |access-date=11 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110416003831/http://www.shanghai.gov.cn/shanghai/node2314/node3766/node3767/node3768/index.html |archive-date=16 April 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> This character appears on all motor vehicle license plates issued in the municipality today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cgs.gzjd.gov.cn/nsyycms/u/cms/www/201310/141301475hqv.pdf|script-title=zh:\u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u673a\u52a8\u8f66\u53f7\u724c|trans-title=License plate of motor vehicle of the People's Republic of China|date=28 September 2007|access-date=29 September 2019|publisher=[[Ministry of State Security of the People's Republic of China]]|language=zh-cn|page=14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503024552/http://www.gzjd.gov.cn/nsyycms/u/cms/www/201310/141301475hqv.pdf|archive-date=3 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n=== Alternative names ===\n{{zh|c={{linktext|\u7533}} |labels=no}} (''Sh\u0113n'') or {{zh|c={{linktext|\u7533|\u57ce}} |labels=no}} (''Sh\u0113nch\u00e9ng'', \"Shen City\") was an early name originating from [[Lord Chunshen]], a 3rd-century BC nobleman and prime minister of the [[Chu (state)|state of Chu]], whose [[fief]] included modern Shanghai.<ref name=\"Shenhu Origin\" /> Shanghainese sports teams and newspapers often use Shen in their names, such as [[Shanghai Shenhua F.C.]] and ''[[Shen Bao]]''.\n\n{{zh|s={{linktext|\u534e|\u4ead}} |labels=no}}{{Efn|{{zh|t=\u83ef\u4ead}}|name=|group=}} (''Hu\u00e1t\u00edng'') was another early name for Shanghai.

[[China|People's Republic of China]]. It is located on the southern estuary of the [[Yangtze]], with the [[Huangpu River]] flowing through it. With a population of 24.28 million {{as of|2019|lc=y}}, it is the [[List of cities in China by population and built-up area|most populous urban area in China]] and the second [[List of largest cities|most populous city proper]] in the world. Shanghai is a global center for finance, [[Science and technology in China|innovation]] and [[Transport in China|transportation]] and the [[Port of Shanghai]] is the [[world's busiest container port]].\n\nOriginally a fishing village and market town, Shanghai grew in importance in the 19th century due to trade and its favorable port location. The city was one of five [[treaty ports]] forced open to foreign trade after the [[First Opium War]]. The [[Shanghai International Settlement]] and the [[Shanghai French Concession|French Concession]] were subsequently established. The city then flourished, becoming a primary commercial and financial hub of the [[Asia-Pacific]] region in the 1930s. During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], the city was the site of the major [[Battle of Shanghai]]. After the war, with the [[Chinese Civil War|CPC takeover of mainland China]] in 1949, trade was limited to other socialist countries and the city's global influence declined.\n\nIn the 1990s, [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms]] introduced by [[Deng Xiaoping]] resulted in an intense redevelopment of the city, especially the [[Pudong]] district, aiding the return of finance and foreign investment to the city. The city has since re-emerged as a hub for international trade and finance; it is the home of the [[Shanghai Stock Exchange]], one of the [[List of stock exchanges|largest stock exchanges in the world]] by market capitalization and the [[Shanghai Free-Trade Zone]], the first [[free-trade zone]] in China.\n\nShanghai has been described as the \"showpiece\" of the booming [[economy of China]]. Featuring several architecture styles such as [[Art Deco]] and [[shikumen]], the city is renowned for its [[Lujiazui]] [[List of tallest buildings in Shanghai|skyline]], museums and historic buildings\u2014including the [[City God Temple of Shanghai|City God Temple]], [[Yu Garden]], the [[China Pavilion]] and buildings along [[the Bund]]. Shanghai is also known for its [[Shanghai cuisine|sugary cuisine]], [[Shanghainese|distinctive dialect]] and vibrant international flair. Every year, the city hosts numerous national and international events, including [[Shanghai Fashion Week]], the [[Chinese Grand Prix]] and [[ChinaJoy]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe two [[Chinese character]]s in the city's name are {{zh|c={{linktext|\u4e0a}} |labels=no}} ({{transl|zh|sh\u00e0ng}}/''zan'', \"upon\") and {{zh|c={{linktext|\u6d77}} |labels=no}} ({{transl|zh|h\u01cei}}/''hae'', \"sea\"), together meaning \"Upon the Sea\". The earliest occurrence of this name dates from the 11th-century [[Song dynasty]], when there was already a river confluence and a town with this name in the area. How the name should be understood has been disputed, but Chinese historians have concluded that during the [[Tang dynasty]], the area of modern-day Shanghai was under the sea level, so the land appeared to be literally \"on the sea\".<ref name=\"Danielson, Eric N. 2004, pp.8-9\">Danielson, Eric N., ''Shanghai and the Yangzi Delta'', 2004, pp.&nbsp;8\u20139.</ref>\nShanghai is officially abbreviated {{zh|s={{linktext|\u6caa}} |labels=no}}{{efn|Traditional Chinese: {{lang|zh-hant|\u6eec}}<ref>{{Cite web|script-title=zh:\u6559\u80b2\u90e8\u91cd\u7de8\u570b\u8a9e\u8fad\u5178\u4fee\u8a02\u672c|url=http://dict.revised.moe.edu.tw/cgi-bin/cbdic/gsweb.cgi?ccd=jhLPR1&o=e0&sec=sec1&op=v&view=1-1|accessdate=29 September 2019|author=National Academy for Educational Research|date=|format=|work=dict.revised.moe.edu.tw|publisher=|language=zh|author-link = National Academy for Educational Research}}</ref>}} ({{transl|zh|H\u00f9}}/''Vu''<sup>2</sup>) in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], a contraction of {{zh|s={{linktext|\u6caa\u6e0e}} |labels=no}}{{efn|Traditional Chinese: {{lang|zh-hant|\u6eec\u7006}}<ref>{{Cite web |script-title=zh:\u6eec\u7006\u8a5e\u8a9e\u89e3\u91cb / \u6eec\u7006\u662f\u4ec0\u9ebd\u610f\u601d|url=http://www.chinesewords.org/dict/178009-179.html|accessdate=29 September 2019|author=|date=|format=|work=www.chinesewords.org|publisher=\u6f22\u8a9e\u7db2|language=zh|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190929063643/http://www.chinesewords.org/dict/178009-179.html|archive-date=29 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>}} ({{transl|zh|H\u00f9 D\u00fa}}/''Vu Doh'', \"[[Harpoon]] Ditch\"), a 4th- or {{nowrap|5th-century}} [[Jin Dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin]] name for the mouth of [[Suzhou Creek]] when it was the main conduit into the ocean.<ref name=\"Shenhu Origin\">{{cite web |url = http://www.shanghai.gov.cn/shanghai/node2314/node3766/node3767/node3768/index.html |script-title=zh:\"\u7533\",\"\u6caa\"\u7684\u7531\u6765 |publisher=Shanghai Municipal People's Government |language=zh-Hans |access-date=11 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110416003831/http://www.shanghai.gov.cn/shanghai/node2314/node3766/node3767/node3768/index.html |archive-date=16 April 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> This character appears on all motor vehicle license plates issued in the municipality today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cgs.gzjd.gov.cn/nsyycms/u/cms/www/201310/141301475hqv.pdf|script-title=zh:\u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u673a\u52a8\u8f66\u53f7\u724c|trans-title=License plate of motor vehicle of the People's Republic of China|date=28 September 2007|access-date=29 September 2019|publisher=[[Ministry of State Security of the People's Republic of China]]|language=zh-cn|page=14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503024552/http://www.gzjd.gov.cn/nsyycms/u/cms/www/201310/141301475hqv.pdf|archive-date=3 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n=== Alternative names ===\n{{zh|c={{linktext|\u7533}} |labels=no}} (''Sh\u0113n'') or {{zh|c={{linktext|\u7533|\u57ce}} |labels=no}} (''Sh\u0113nch\u00e9ng'', \"Shen City\") was an early name originating from [[Lord Chunshen]], a 3rd-century BC nobleman and prime minister of the [[Chu (state)|state of Chu]], whose [[fief]] included modern Shanghai.<ref name=\"Shenhu Origin\" /> Shanghainese sports teams and newspapers often use Shen in their names, such as [[Shanghai Shenhua F.C.]] and ''[[Shen Bao]]''.\n\n{{zh|s={{linktext|\u534e|\u4ead}} |labels=no}}{{Efn|{{zh|t=\u83ef\u4ead}}|name=|group=}} (''Hu\u00e1t\u00edng'') was another early name for Shanghai.
