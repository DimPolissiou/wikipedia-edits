In the present, [[Phil Coulson]]'s team monitors a deal revolving around the Obelisk, which goes awry when [[Absorbing Man|Carl Creel]] kills the ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. agent offering the intel and escapes with it. Agent Skye interrogates Grant Ward and learns that Hydra is using communication channels not monitored by S.H.I.E.L.D. The team realizes that General [[Glenn Talbot]] is in trouble and rushes to rescue him from Creel, before abducting Talbot themselves and using him to break into a military facility full of confiscated S.H.I.E.L.D. assets. Agent Isabelle Hartley finds the Obelisk, while Skye and Agent Antoine Triplett steal a cloak-capable [[quinjet]]. [[Lance Hunter]] leaves with his team of mercenaries enlisted by S.H.I.E.L.D., only to be ambushed by Creel, whose attack kills Hartley.

When a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and patient of T.A.H.I.T.I. is killed and her body carved with the symbols (by the former agent who had carved the painting previously), Coulson uses [[The Magical Place|Hydra's memory machine]] to find other patients who were injected with the drug. He goes after the remaining patients, trying to find an end to the madness. He discovers that the writing is actually a 3D diagram of a city where the alien host of GH-325 apparently wished to go. Seeing the completed design ends his need to carve, but since Hydra is also searching for the city, he makes it a priority for S.H.I.E.L.D. to find it first.

PaleyFest panel that the writers are able to read the screenplays for upcoming [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|Marvel Cinematic Universe films]] to know where the universe is heading, which allowed them to form a plan for the show through the end of a third season.<ref name=\"Mar2014Paley\" /> On May 8, 2014, the series was renewed for a second season of 22 episodes.<ref name=\"S2Renew\" /><ref name=\"S2Eps\" />\n\n===Writing===\nIn July 2014, [[Clark Gregg]] stated that the season resumes months after the end of season one, and \"the monumental nature of [rebuilding S.H.I.E.L.D.] is made very clear almost immediately, because you realize everyone\u2014US government, US military and other wise\u2014wants to arrest us. S.H.I.E.L.D.'s illegal. We have very few resources. Everything we're going to do involves dealing with, still, finding out who's Hydra and who's not amongst our friends. To rebuild S.H.I.E.L.D., we're going to need some old friends to prove themselves, some new friends, and we're going to have to do it in a way that's very back alley, old school.\"<ref name=\"GreggS2Plot\" />\n\nIn September 2014, talking about whether the ending of the season would also be a satisfying end to the series, Bell said \"we're not thinking of it as a series finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some momentum coming in [to season 2] and I think we pick up on it. I'm optimistic that we can keep the plane in the air a little longer.\" He also talked about whether the themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re-explored in the second, saying \"What we always look for are the human elements in the big story. That's what television does well, it makes you care about people, and whether it's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together, it takes on some sort of family metaphor.\"<ref name=\"BellSep2014\" /> Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season, saying \"In many ways, the whole metaphor at the heart of the show is family\u2014you've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people, and it allows us to play out different dynamics; literally, this season, we had Skye's biological parents versus her surrogate parents. And at the same time, we had Skye growing up. We had her going from a slightly sulky hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full-fledged superhero and so as we grow up, we separate from our parents... In our minds, her mom wasn't a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position.\"<ref name=\"BellVarietyFinale\" /> Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually [[Daisy Johnson]], [[Maurissa Tancharoen]] explained that<blockquote>Johnson is a character that we always liked. We always knew there was a potential to evolve Skye into something else. It took a little bit of time, but we were happy when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson, and actually have that work in our mythology. But as with everything that we do on the show, we pull from the properties, and we do our own spin to it. So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her evolve as a person, we've grown to like her as a person, we've seen her evolve as an agent. And now, finally bringing her to her origin story\u2014I think there's just a lot more emotional weight to it, because you already know her as just Skye, and now she will have this ability that she may not understand, that she may not want ... We're going to focus on Skye, and how that affects the people around her, and how the relationships may shift. Because we've seen through the course of our series so far; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or views them, and they're categorized, things like that. What does that mean when one of your own is now considered someone with an ability? How do you categorize her?</blockquote>Whedon elaborated that \"We're going to walk her through the steps of discovering what this really means, and coming to terms with it. All that stuff is really interesting to us, and in television, because we have time to explore, we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths.\"<ref name=\"CBRDec2014\" /> Additionally, Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal, saying, \"She's still Skye, because ''she'' thinks she's Skye. I think her dad thinks she's Daisy, and we'll see if she ever gets to the point where she believes that that's something that she would want to call herself. But right now, she has her own identity.\"<ref name=\"CBRMar2015\" />\n\nIn December 2014, [[Jed Whedon]] explained the benefits of introducing a society of superhuman characters in the [[Inhumans]], saying \"One of the things that, early on was very important to us last season was, there were so few people in the Cinematic Universe who had powers. Really, only two humans had powers, Captain America and the Hulk. We had to be very responsible\u2014we didn't want to dive into this show and have a new one every week, and have it feel like we disregarded everything that they spent so much money and time building in the films. Along those same lines, the origin of a power is always a complex thing\u2014Marvel cares about it feeling grounded, it feeling scientific at some level. Even on ''Thor'', he says, \"In our world, magic and science are the same thing.\" So this is a way for us to sort of open up our world. It's a way to introduce, into the MCU, the idea that people can be born with a power. They don't have to be engineered in a lab, they don't need to have some freak accident with a vat of acid. They can be born with this. That's sort of a gamechanger, not just on our show, but in the cinematic universe\".<ref name=\"CBRDec2014\" />\n\nAfter the season finale, Bell talked about Coulson losing his arm, saying that \"he paid a price\u2014that was important to us. You don't mess with the forces of nature without getting bitten, and the fact that he literally saved everyone on the ship by that crystal not shattering was a wonderful, heroic thing and showed you that at heart, Coulson is a heroic man whose actions back up his words.\" Bell also talked about the cliffhanger involving Simmons being absorbed by a [[Kree]] monolith: \"When we first started talking about the Monolith, we knew that it needed to present a threat and we needed to demonstrate some of that threat and the promise of more story... It's easy to kill a character for shock value or whatever, and we did have a number of deaths this season, but ... we prefer to leave you with something to talk about, to walk away with. This is something that came up in the room, we talked about what it meant ... The idea of getting Fitz and Simmons\u2014who had been one person\u2014to become two whole people, come back together, agree to go on a date, and then have this happen, felt beautifully poetic\".<ref name=\"BellVarietyFinale\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Chloe Bennet at PaleyFest 2014.jpg|thumb|180px|Chloe Bennet portrays series regular Skye, who is revealed to be a version of Daisy Johnson in the season]]\nAll principal cast members from the first season (Gregg as [[Phil Coulson]], [[Ming-Na Wen]] as Melinda May, [[Brett Dalton]] as Grant Ward, [[Chloe Bennet]] as Skye, [[Iain De Caestecker]] as Leo Fitz, and [[Elizabeth Henstridge]] as Jemma Simmons) returned for the second season, and were joined by [[Nick Blood]] as [[Lance Hunter]].<ref name=\"Ep1Synopsis\" /><ref name=\"2014SDCCPanel\" /> In December 2014, main character Skye was revealed to be a version of Daisy Johnson.<ref name=\"DaisyCal\" /><ref name=\"SkyeReveal\" /> With the episode \"Aftershocks\", [[Adrianne Palicki]], who portrays [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Bobbi Morse]], was upgraded to a principal cast member.<ref name=\"Palicki\" /><ref name=\"PalickiMainVariety\" /><ref name=\"PalickiMain\" /> Also returning from earlier in the series are [[Christine Adams (actress)|Christine Adams]] as Anne Weaver,<ref name=\"RealSHIELDLeaders\" /> [[Jaimie Alexander]] as [[Sif (comics)|Sif]],<ref name=\"Alexander\" /> B.J.

To get to the final look, the writers spent a lot of time discussing what her transformed look would entail, such as if she would have a nose, or a tail, with series writer Drew Greenberg eventually suggesting thorns. With the design idea in hand, Hetrick and his team began compiling potential designs for the character, looking to the [[Clive Barker]] film ''[[Nightbreed]]'', specifically the character Shuna Sassi, because \"She's a creature covered in porcupine quills and that image is so strong \u2014 it creates such a striking silhouette\". Since Hetrick and his team did not have source material to pull from in the comics, he wanted to \"make her feel like the first real Inhuman\" and give her face a level of symmetry. When creating the prosthetic makeup, which was done in two weeks, the producers wanted to still be able to see Negga's eyes, with Bell saying, \"Ruth Negga has amazingly expressive eyes and eyebrows. And she gets so much of who Raina is through the eyes. We wanted her to still be able to communicate, we still wanted you to feel her expressions through all of [the makeup].\"<ref name=\"RainaMakeUp\" />\n\nFor the \"real S.H.I.E.L.D.\" faction introduced this season, the producers and Marvel decided to create a new S.H.I.E.L.D. logo, to differentiate from the normal one used on the series. This new logo uses the shape of [[Captain America]]'s original shield, as opposed to the updated round shape, and has 3 stars on it.<ref name=\"OneDoorClosesPoster\" />\n\n===Filming===\nProduction on the season began in late July 2014,<ref name=\"Zap2ItJuly2014\" /> in [[Culver City, California]].<ref name=\"PostVFX\" /> Additional photography took place around the world, including in [[Old San Juan, Puerto Rico]] for \"[[...Ye Who Enter Here]]\" and \"[[What They Become]]\".<ref name=\"PuertoRicoFilming\" />\n\n===Music===\nTo reflect the darker tone of the second season, the standard orchestra was changed from season one, with the low brass and strings expanded, and the woodwind section reduced, \"giving [the orchestra] added punch and menace.\" Composer [[Bear McCreary]]'s use of the electric guitar was also reduced for the second season, while his general synth programming was changed from \"warm, round tones\" to \"mangled under heavy distortion\" sound.<ref name=\"McCrearyS2Begins\" />\n\nMcCreary introduced a new Hydra theme for the season, explaining that \"Last season got pretty musically complicated. I had a theme that associated itself with Centipede, The Clairvoyant, [[John Garrett (comics)|John Garrett]] and Raina. That theme ultimately functioned like a Hydra Theme. I had a theme for Victoria Hand that, while the audience briefly suspected her, also functioned as the Hydra Theme. I had a[nother] theme for Garrett that also acted like the theme for Hydra. It got so complicated ... The answer was obvious: I needed to write a new Hydra Theme, one that could be associated with Dr. Whitehall.\"<ref name=\"McCrearyS2Begins\" /> For Hayley Atwell's appearances as Peggy Carter, McCreary decided to quote the Agent Carter theme composed by [[Christopher Lennertz]] for the ''[[Agent Carter (film)|Agent Carter]]'' short film. On using Lennertz's theme, McCreary said, \"I was excited for the opportunity to incorporate his music into my S.H.I.E.L.D. score, because it further cements the Marvel [Cinematic] Universe together as a coherent whole ... Chris was thrilled and sent me his scores for reference.\"<ref name=\"McCrearyS2Begins\" /> A soundtrack featuring music from the first and second seasons was released by [[Marvel Music]] digitally on September 4, 2015, and on CD in October 2015.<ref name=\"SeriesSoundtrack\" /><ref name=\"SoundtrackiTunes\" />\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\nExecutive producer Maurissa Tancharoen stated the production team was not ruling out creating crossover episodes with ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Agent Carter]]'' or ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' during the season, with executive producer Jed Whedon adding that any such episodes would not equal the scale seen in the ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' crossover from the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 1)|first season]], saying, \"In terms of game-changers, [those episodes are] hard to beat.\"<ref name=\"Zap2ItJuly2014\" /> Bell later said ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' \"is coming up and we know what's going on with that and look forward to seeing it, but it's pretty cool to find ways to tie-in stuff and connect things.\"<ref name=\"BellSep2014\" /> In December 2014, ABC confirmed the series would tie-in with ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', with Whedon saying, \"You should expect something. ''The Avengers'' is the big tent that all the franchises play under. Obviously, we're included in that.\"<ref name=\"AoUTieIn\" /> The episodes \"The Frenemy of My Enemy\" and \"The Dirty Half Dozen\" feature \"Easter eggs, plot threads and other connective tissue leading into the opening scene of ''Avengers: Age of Ultron''\" while \"Scars\" explores the aftermath of the film.<ref name=\"AoUTieIn2\" />\n\nTalking on how the season would interact with ''Agent Carter'', Bell said, \"Here's what I think is interesting. ''Agent Carter'' seems to be about S.S.R. pre-S.H.I.E.L.D., but about the beginnings of something, and the basic values of that. S.H.I.E.L.D. got blown up last year and what Coulson always wanted was a return to basics, and it gives us an opportunity to return to some of those core values and even physically, some of that S.S.R. stuff has a way of finding its way into our show that could be cool. Anyway we can tie things together, we're going to try to do it, but it is hard when the stories are 60 years apart.\"<ref name=\"BellSep2014\" /> Several scenes in \"Shadows\" and \"The Things We Bury\" are flashbacks featuring Peggy Carter which serve as an introduction to the world of ''Agent Carter'', setting up characters and ideas for that series, including Carter's belief in the need for \"a permanent unit during peacetime\", which will lead to the creation of S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref name=\"ACcrossover\" /><ref name=\"Ep8Synopsis\" /> The episode \"Making Friends and Influencing People\" names Hydra's ability to brainwash people as the [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Faustus Method]],<ref name=\"Faustus1\" /><ref name=\"Faustus2\" /> named for the character who appears, as Johann Fennhoff, in ''Agent Carter'', played by [[Ralph Brown]].<ref name=\"Fennhoff\" />\n\nThe season confirms that the blue alien seen in the first season, and a recurring plot point this season, was a member of the [[Kree]] race, who play a significant role in ''Guardians of the Galaxy''.<ref name=\"BennetBellKree\" /> Whedon explained that \"We obviously showed this body a year ago at around this time. When we were breaking that and sussing out what this arc would be, we had to have a lot of the pieces in place from the get go ... we had to talk to features about what their plans were and where they were going.\" When asked whether this counts as the series tie-in to ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', Whedon said \"It is a very far away other galaxy, so it's a little bit harder to have one of them walk into our set, so a direct tie-in is a little bit more challenging, but it's all one universe, so there's always opportunity for more. ... In ''Guardians'', we saw parts in our universe that we hadn't explored yet, so it shows we're a part of that too.\"<ref name=\"EWKree\" /> This storyline also introduces the Inhumans to the MCU, ahead of their [[Inhumans (film)|own film]] that was planned.<ref name=\"SkyeReveal\" />\n\nAt the end of the season, Bell stated on the way that the season had tied in with the films, \"we got to be our own show and tell our own stories in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and do a nice hand off or a tie-in, but neither are incumbent upon the other to be a follow, and I think that's a great model for us.\"<ref name=\"BellVarietyFinale\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n[[File:Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. season 2 motion poster.gif|thumb|155px|left|A motion poster released in December 2014, showing the shift in focus from Hydra in the first half of the season to the Inhumans in the second.]]\nAt the [[San Diego Comic-Con International|2014 San Diego Comic-Con]], ahead of the premiere of the season, Marvel Custom Solutions and [[Lexus]] released a limited single-issue [[Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics|comic tie-in]] titled [[Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics#Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: The Chase (2014)|''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: The Chase'']],<ref name=\"AoSTC\" /> set between the Season 1 episodes \"Seeds\" and \"T.R.A.C.K.S.\",<ref name=\"AoSTC1\" /> written by George Kitson, and with art by  Mirko Colak, Neil Edwards, and Mirco Pierfederici.<ref name=\"AoSTCTeam\" /> On October 10, 2014, \"Face My Enemy\" was screened at [[New York Comic Con]].<ref name=\"NYCCEpisode\" />\n\n===\"The Art of Evolution\"===\nFor the final twelve episodes of the season, Marvel once again ran the \"Art of...\" initiative, in which a different image was released each Thursday before a new episode, depicting a first look at a key event from the upcoming episode, with the season's title being \"The Art of Evolution\". The different artists were once again chosen to create the teaser posters, based on their previous work and how it connected to the themes and emotion of the intended episode. On how what is shown on each poster is chosen, Bell said, \"maybe we'll show [the artist] the script or let them watch the episode and let them respond to it emotionally and see what's interesting to them. And then we have a conversation with them about how we'd like to portray that, and then we try to lean into the strengths that they have. Some are more graphic, some are more character based, some are more composite, and some are cleaner. And that's one of the things [the producers] really look forward to each week, getting the initial sketches back from the artists and seeing their interpretation.\"<ref name=\"AftershocksPoster\" /> The art once again appeared as [[variant cover]]s to select titles published by [[Marvel Comics]] in June 2015.<ref name=\"ArtEvolutionVariants\" />\n\nThe poster for \"Aftershocks\", created by [[Gabriele Dell'Otto]], the co-creator of Daisy Johnson, depicts Skye twice, as she is transforming from the Terrigen mist and as the person dealing with her powers, as well as a transformed Raina, Coulson and the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo in the background.<ref name=\"AftershocksPoster\" /> For \"Who You Really Are\", the producers enlisted [[Marcos Mart\u00edn]] to create the poster, which highlighted Sif's (Jaimie Alexander) return to the show, as well as an \"inside look\" at S.H.I.E.L.D. as the logo crumbles, with Skye in the center of it, ambiguously leaving the viewer questioning if the logo was crumbling due to Sif's sword, or Skye's powers.<ref name=\"WhoYouReallyArePoster\" /> The third poster, for \"One of Us\", was created by [[Declan Shalvey]] and [[Jordie Bellaire]]. It features muted colors and shows \"Coulson surrounded by villains [from the S.H.I.E.L.D. index], and the giant Cal looming over, and [a bird and] S.H.I.E.L.D. behind him.\"<ref name=\"OneofUsPoster\" /> Annie Wu was brought on for the \"Love in the Time of Hydra\" poster, which shows Grant Ward holding a woman, though depicts her as two; one drawn in red, the other in blue \u2013 \"half of that goes to Agent 33, who has two faces... And it also goes to the fact that she's been imitating other people as she did with Agent May.\"<ref name=\"LoveintheTimeofHydraPoster\" />\n\n\"One Door Closes\", an episode focused on Bobbi Morse's history, received a poster of her with the \"real S.H.I.E.L.D.\" logo, that \"embraced the basics\" of four-color printing, utilizing magenta, cyan, black and yellow, while still having layers and complications, much like the character of Morse. The poster was designed by Delicious Design League.<ref name=\"OneDoorClosesPoster\" /> The poster for \"Afterlife\" by Dave Johnson, highlights the divide within S.H.I.E.L.D. and the alliances on each side. With Coulson in the middle, Agents Gonzales, Morse, Mackenzie and Weaver stem from the \"real S.H.I.E.L.D.\", while Hunter, Fitz and Simmons stem from the other.<ref name=\"AfterlifePoster\" /> \"Melinda\"{{'}}s poster, by [[Jenny Frison]], mirrored the focus of the episode by prominently featuring an image of May, highlighting her backstory and why she is called \"the Cavalry\".<ref name=\"MelindaPoster\" /> Marvel teamed with Nathan Fox on the poster for \"The Frenemy of My Enemy\", which depicts Ward, Kara, and Bakshi in \"Hydra red\"; Coulson, Hunter, and Fitz in \"S.H.I.E.L.D. blue\"; and Deathlok neutral. They are all featured together, just as the season is \"starting to put [all of its plotlines] together in new combinations in new ways, [to] propel us into the last four episodes.\"<ref name=\"TheFrenemyofMyEnemyPoster\" />\n\nAs alluded to by the episode title, the poster for \"The Dirty Half Dozen\", with art by Jake Wyatt, sees the original recruits to Coulson's S.H.I.E.L.D. team from the first season (May, Ward, Fitz, Simmons and Skye), along with Coulson, together once again, suiting up for a mission together; it is also the first poster of the \"Art of...\" series to feature the episode title on the poster.<ref name=\"DirtyHalfDozenPoster\" /> Marguerite Sauvage provided the poster for \"Scars\", which prominently features Jiaying and her scars in a way that the series cannot do with special effects, while also depicting Skye near the former's stomach to cement the maternal connection between them.<ref name=\"ScarsPoster\" /> For Part One of the season finale, \"S.O.S\", [[Ryan Sook]]'s poster hints at Cal's transformation into the [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mr. Hyde]] persona from the comics, in an homage to traditional comic book covers.<ref name=\"SOS1Poster\" /> For Part Two, artist Joshua Budich brought together all of the main players of the season, divided into Coulson and his team, and those who served as antagonists to them throughout the season (though not necessarily villains), with Skye and some Terrigen crystals in the middle, pointing to Skye's confused allegiances and the importance of the crystals in the finale.<ref name=\"SOS2Poster\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Broadcast===\nIn June 2014, Clark Gregg stated he believed the season would be shown in a block of 10 episodes, then breaking for ''Agent Carter'', before airing the remaining 12.<ref name=\"S2EpisodeNumber\" /> Explaining this decision, Bell said, <blockquote>One of our challenges last year was to produce 22 episodes that aired over, what, 40 weeks? 36 weeks? Something like that. And the age of re-runs is dead. Re-runs are death, and so you're trying to commit to the habit of the show and [viewers] tune in to something else or a re-run and they'll get pissed off. They'll go away. What this allows us to do is minimize repeats. We're showing ten episodes, and there has to be a gap or two because it's physically impossible to produce ten shows and get through post production in time, we can't do that so there's going to be a Marvel special at some point. But pretty much every week you're showing up and we're there, and then instead of a repeat showing up mid-run and losing momentum, ''Agent Carter'' comes in and has its own cool stuff, and they're running eight weeks in a row, then we can come back and run twelve in a row with no interruptions. We're still producing our show every week but it just gives us time, barely, to finish 22 on schedule.

United States network television schedule|2014\u201315 television season]]. It also had an average total 18-49 rating of 2.7, which was 32nd.<ref name=\"S2AvgRatings\" />\n\n===Critical response===\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports a 91% approval rating with an average score of 7.66/10, based on 32 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"''Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' relaxes into itself during its sophomore season, mitigating the show's growing pains by focusing on characters while amping up narrative thrills.\"<ref name=\"RT\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/marvel-s-agents-of-s-h-i-e-l-d-/s02/|title=Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Season 2 (2014\u20132015)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=September 19, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006185922/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/marvel-s-agents-of-s-h-i-e-l-d-/s02|archive-date=October 6, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMarc Buston for ''[[Den of Geek]]'' scored the premiere episode 4.5 stars out of 5, feeling that the series had finally reached its potential by incorporating Marvel elements such as Creel and Whitehall, while also creating a darker tone and developing the original characters. He specifically highlighted the changes made to Fitz' character, saying \"This lair of tragedy greatly deepens Fitz's character and gives the comic relief of last season a heartbreaking edge.\"<ref name=\"DoGBuxtonPremiereReview\" /> James Hunt, also for ''Den of Geek'', gave a positive review as well, stating \"The momentum of last season's finale hasn't been lost, and indeed, it's even been added to. Last year I criticised the pilot episode for, above all else, failing to recreate the feel of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This year, it's only fair that I praise the season opener for doing exactly that.\"<ref name=\"DoGHuntPremiereReview\" /> Kevin Fitzpatrick at Screen Crush called the premiere \"unexpectedly good\", noting that the series \"remains as serialized a show as it can over 22 episodes\", introducing new and interesting ideas for the rest of the season, while also setting a high standard for subsequent episodes to meet.<ref name=\"ScreenCrushPremiereReview\" />\n\nAlan Sepinwall at HitFix called the episode a promising start to the season, \"a fairly lively hour in spite of [a lot of exposition], helped by some good casting and smart creative choices\". He was positive about both the changes to the existing characters and the introduction of the new ones, and though he noted that the opening sequence was \"itself a piece of brand extension \u2014 early promotion for ''Agent Carter'',\" he felt that \"Links to the rest of the Marvel [Cinematic U]niverse are always welcome when they're in service to the story the show is telling\".<ref name=\"HitFixPremiereReview\" /> Eric Goldman of [[IGN]] scored the episode an 8.3 out of 10, praising the visual style, which he called \"less glossy\" than previous episodes, as well as the introduction of new characters and development of old ones, especially the introduction of Carl Creel and the \"nicely done FX showing off his power\".<ref name=\"IGNPremiereReview\" /> Oliver Sava of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' graded the episode a 'B-', feeling that \"With a clearly defined villain and mission statement, this show's second season is already off to a better start than its first year, but there's still plenty of room for the series to grow. The scripts could use more energy, the action could be better choreographed, and it could use a huge injection of style for both the visual and audio elements. There's so much potential in ''Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' ... but the show's creators aren't fully exploring it yet.\"<ref name=\"AVClubPremiereReview\" />\n\nAt the end of the season, Goldman graded it an 8.2 out of 10, saying the season \"found the show much-improved, as it moved faster and delved deeper into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\" Compared to the first season, Goldman felt the \"pacing was hugely improved, with storylines no longer taking forever to bubble up again and secrets no longer being kept both from the audience and the characters,\" with content from the first season being resolved, while still introducing new plot lines and mysteries to play out over the season. He also praised the characterization improvement and called the season \"less restrained\" in connecting to its comics roots. While he appreciated the new characters that join the series, specifically MacLachlan's portrayal of Cal, he felt Triplett was \"never fully utilized\", which made his death in the midseason finale less impactful. Additionally, Goldman criticized the tie-in to ''Age of Ultron'', calling it \"forced\" and distracting from the Inhuman/S.H.I.E.L.D. 2.0 storylines.<ref name=\"IGNSeasonReview\" /> Nick Hogan at TV Overmind rated the season 9 out of 10 stars, calling it, \"for the most part, a very enjoyable season of television.\" Hogan praised that cast and characters, particularly MacLachlan's portrayal of Calvin Zabo, saying \"He had perhaps the strongest character arc of anyone this season, and it was such a pleasure to watch.\" He did criticize some of the story direction, feeling that it took a while for the Inhumans to connect to the rest of the series, and that the way the ''Age of Ultron'' tie-in concluded the S.H.I.E.L.D. vs. S.H.I.E.L.D. storyline was \"rushed and choppy\".<ref name=\"TVOvermindSeasonReview\" />\n\n===Analysis===\nThe season's introduction of the Inhumans and apparent willingness to establish new norms ahead of the films has been highlighted by critics:\n\nSava felt that having the series introduce the race made ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' \"an essential part of Marvel Studios' bigger plans for the future\", explaining that \"the series has become more and more connected to the larger MCU since ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', but it's always been in a reactive role. Stuff happens in the movies, and ''Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' deals with the fallout. Not anymore. This show is making things happen, and these events will clearly impact the future of the MCU because we know there's an ''Inhumans'' movie planned for 2019.\" Sava also mentioned that introducing the Inhumans \"on a personal level rather than a cosmic level\" via the television series makes \"the whole idea a bit easier to swallow\" for the general MCU audience.<ref name=\"SavaAnalysis\" />\n\nMerrill Barr of ''[[Forbes]]'' thought that by not only introducing the Inhumans ahead of the film, but by depicting the spreading of the race throughout the world, was part of the series cementing its \"right to exist\" apart from the films. Talking about the season finale, Barr said, \"''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' does a most excellent job of standing on its own two feet in a way we've never seen it do before. Come the final frame, all anyone \u2013 Marvel fan or otherwise \u2013 will be asking is when season three begins. The note the show leaves viewers on is one that will make them realize, perhaps for the first time, that the journey of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' is not only worth it now, but perhaps always has been.\"<ref name=\"BarrAnalysis\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 99%;\"\n|-\n!

The season is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) and acknowledges the continuity of [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the franchise's films]] and other [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|television series]]. It was produced by [[ABC Studios]], [[Marvel Television]], and [[Mutant Enemy Productions]], with [[Jed Whedon]], [[Maurissa Tancharoen]], and [[Jeffrey Bell]] serving as [[showrunner]]s.\n\n[[Clark Gregg]] reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, starring alongside the returning series regulars [[Ming-Na Wen]], [[Brett Dalton]], [[Chloe Bennet]], [[Iain De Caestecker]], and [[Elizabeth Henstridge]]. They are joined by [[Nick Blood]] and [[Adrianne Palicki]]. A second season of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' was ordered in May 2014, and production began in [[Culver City, California]] that July. Some episodes directly crossover with the television series ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Agent Carter]]'' and the film ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015), while the [[Inhumans]] were introduced to set up the [[Inhumans (film)|planned film of the same name]] and connect to the film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014). [[Glenn Hetrick]] designed prosthetics for the Inhuman characters. Several actors reprise their MCU roles in the season for guest appearances.\n\nThe season aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from September 23, 2014, to May 12, 2015, and consists of 22 episodes. The [[Shadows (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|season premiere]] was watched by 5.98 million people, less than half the viewing total for the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

In the present, [[Phil Coulson]]'s team monitors a deal revolving around the Obelisk, which goes awry when [[Absorbing Man|Carl Creel]] kills the ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. agent offering the intel and escapes with it. Agent Skye interrogates Grant Ward and learns that Hydra is using communication channels not monitored by S.H.I.E.L.D. The team realizes that General [[Glenn Talbot]] is in trouble and rushes to rescue him from Creel, before abducting Talbot themselves and using him to break into a military facility full of confiscated S.H.I.E.L.D. assets. Agent Isabelle Hartley finds the Obelisk, while Skye and Agent Antoine Triplett steal a cloak-capable [[quinjet]]. [[Lance Hunter]] leaves with his team of mercenaries enlisted by S.H.I.E.L.D., only to be ambushed by Creel, whose attack kills Hartley. Creel then steals the Obelisk for an apparently un-aged Reinhardt, now going by the name Daniel Whitehall.\n |LineColor = 881E1E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

Creel absorbs the properties of the Obelisk and accidentally kills a waitress in a bar. He later meets Raina, but declines her offer to help him. Talbot tries to persuade Hunter to work for him and sets him free, but Hunter returns to S.H.I.E.L.D. wanting revenge for his fallen friends. Agent Leo Fitz and the mechanic Agent [[Al MacKenzie|Mack]] are able to build a weapon that can incapacitate Creel. As the team observes Creel making a deal with Whitehall's second-in-command Sunil Bakshi, Hunter disarms the other agents and tries to kill Creel himself. However, Creel easily defeats him.

S.H.I.E.L.D.'s illegal. We have very few resources. Everything we're going to do involves dealing with, still, finding out who's Hydra and who's not amongst our friends. To rebuild S.H.I.E.L.D., we're going to need some old friends to prove themselves, some new friends, and we're going to have to do it in a way that's very back alley, old school.\"<ref name=\"GreggS2Plot\" />\n\nIn September 2014, talking about whether the ending of the season would also be a satisfying end to the series, Bell said \"we're not thinking of it as a series finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some momentum coming in [to season 2] and I think we pick up on it. I'm optimistic that we can keep the plane in the air a little longer.\" He also talked about whether the themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re-explored in the second, saying \"What we always look for are the human elements in the big story. That's what television does well, it makes you care about people, and whether it's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together, it takes on some sort of family metaphor.\"<ref name=\"BellSep2014\" /> Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season, saying \"In many ways, the whole metaphor at the heart of the show is family\u2014you've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people, and it allows us to play out different dynamics; literally, this season, we had Skye's biological parents versus her surrogate parents. And at the same time, we had Skye growing up. We had her going from a slightly sulky hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full-fledged superhero and so as we grow up, we separate from our parents... In our minds, her mom wasn't a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position.\"<ref name=\"BellVarietyFinale\" /> Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually [[Daisy Johnson]], [[Maurissa Tancharoen]] explained that<blockquote>Johnson is a character that we always liked. We always knew there was a potential to evolve Skye into something else. It took a little bit of time, but we were happy when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson, and actually have that work in our mythology. But as with everything that we do on the show, we pull from the properties, and we do our own spin to it. So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her evolve as a person, we've grown to like her as a person, we've seen her evolve as an agent. And now, finally bringing her to her origin story\u2014I think there's just a lot more emotional weight to it, because you already know her as just Skye, and now she will have this ability that she may not understand, that she may not want ... We're going to focus on Skye, and how that affects the people around her, and how the relationships may shift. Because we've seen through the course of our series so far; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or views them, and they're categorized, things like that. What does that mean when one of your own is now considered someone with an ability? How do you categorize her?</blockquote>Whedon elaborated that \"We're going to walk her through the steps of discovering what this really means, and coming to terms with it. All that stuff is really interesting to us, and in television, because we have time to explore, we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths.\"<ref name=\"CBRDec2014\" /> Additionally, Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal, saying, \"She's still Skye, because ''she'' thinks she's Skye. I think her dad thinks she's Daisy, and we'll see if she ever gets to the point where she believes that that's something that she would want to call herself. But right now, she has her own identity.\"<ref name=\"CBRMar2015\" />\n\nIn December 2014, [[Jed Whedon]] explained the benefits of introducing a society of superhuman characters in the [[Inhumans]], saying \"One of the things that, early on was very important to us last season was, there were so few people in the Cinematic Universe who had powers. Really, only two humans had powers, Captain America and the Hulk. We had to be very responsible\u2014we didn't want to dive into this show and have a new one every week, and have it feel like we disregarded everything that they spent so much money and time building in the films. Along those same lines, the origin of a power is always a complex thing\u2014Marvel cares about it feeling grounded, it feeling scientific at some level. Even on ''Thor'', he says, \"In our world, magic and science are the same thing.\" So this is a way for us to sort of open up our world. It's a way to introduce, into the MCU, the idea that people can be born with a power. They don't have to be engineered in a lab, they don't need to have some freak accident with a vat of acid. They can be born with this. That's sort of a gamechanger, not just on our show, but in the cinematic universe\".<ref name=\"CBRDec2014\" />\n\nAfter the season finale, Bell talked about Coulson losing his arm, saying that \"he paid a price\u2014that was important to us. You don't mess with the forces of nature without getting bitten, and the fact that he literally saved everyone on the ship by that crystal not shattering was a wonderful, heroic thing and showed you that at heart, Coulson is a heroic man whose actions back up his words.\" Bell also talked about the cliffhanger involving Simmons being absorbed by a [[Kree]] monolith: \"When we first started talking about the Monolith, we knew that it needed to present a threat and we needed to demonstrate some of that threat and the promise of more story... It's easy to kill a character for shock value or whatever, and we did have a number of deaths this season, but ... we prefer to leave you with something to talk about, to walk away with. This is something that came up in the room, we talked about what it meant ... The idea of getting Fitz and Simmons\u2014who had been one person\u2014to become two whole people, come back together, agree to go on a date, and then have this happen, felt beautifully poetic\".<ref name=\"BellVarietyFinale\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Chloe Bennet at PaleyFest 2014.jpg|thumb|180px|Chloe Bennet portrays series regular Skye, who is revealed to be a version of Daisy Johnson in the season]]\nAll principal cast members from the first season (Gregg as [[Phil Coulson]], [[Ming-Na Wen]] as Melinda May, [[Brett Dalton]] as Grant Ward, [[Chloe Bennet]] as Skye, [[Iain De Caestecker]] as Leo Fitz, and [[Elizabeth Henstridge]] as Jemma Simmons) returned for the second season, and were joined by [[Nick Blood]] as [[Lance Hunter]].<ref name=\"Ep1Synopsis\" /><ref name=\"2014SDCCPanel\" /> In December 2014, main character Skye was revealed to be a version of Daisy Johnson.<ref name=\"DaisyCal\" /><ref name=\"SkyeReveal\" /> With the episode \"Aftershocks\", [[Adrianne Palicki]], who portrays [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Bobbi Morse]], was upgraded to a principal cast member.<ref name=\"Palicki\" /><ref name=\"PalickiMainVariety\" /><ref name=\"PalickiMain\" /> Also returning from earlier in the series are [[Christine Adams (actress)|Christine Adams]] as Anne Weaver,<ref name=\"RealSHIELDLeaders\" /> [[Jaimie Alexander]] as [[Sif (comics)|Sif]],<ref name=\"Alexander\" /> B.J.

To get to the final look, the writers spent a lot of time discussing what her transformed look would entail, such as if she would have a nose, or a tail, with series writer Drew Greenberg eventually suggesting thorns. With the design idea in hand, Hetrick and his team began compiling potential designs for the character, looking to the [[Clive Barker]] film ''[[Nightbreed]]'', specifically the character Shuna Sassi, because \"She's a creature covered in porcupine quills and that image is so strong \u2014 it creates such a striking silhouette\". Since Hetrick and his team did not have source material to pull from in the comics, he wanted to \"make her feel like the first real Inhuman\" and give her face a level of symmetry. When creating the prosthetic makeup, which was done in two weeks, the producers wanted to still be able to see Negga's eyes, with Bell saying, \"Ruth Negga has amazingly expressive eyes and eyebrows. And she gets so much of who Raina is through the eyes. We wanted her to still be able to communicate, we still wanted you to feel her expressions through all of [the makeup].\"<ref name=\"RainaMakeUp\" />\n\nFor the \"real S.H.I.E.L.D.\" faction introduced this season, the producers and Marvel decided to create a new S.H.I.E.L.D. logo, to differentiate from the normal one used on the series. This new logo uses the shape of [[Captain America]]'s original shield, as opposed to the updated round shape, and has 3 stars on it.<ref name=\"OneDoorClosesPoster\" />\n\n===Filming===\nProduction on the season began in late July 2014,<ref name=\"Zap2ItJuly2014\" /> in [[Culver City, California]].<ref name=\"PostVFX\" /> Additional photography took place around the world, including in [[Old San Juan, Puerto Rico]] for \"[[...Ye Who Enter Here]]\" and \"[[What They Become]]\".<ref name=\"PuertoRicoFilming\" />\n\n===Music===\nTo reflect the darker tone of the second season, the standard orchestra was changed from season one, with the low brass and strings expanded, and the woodwind section reduced, \"giving [the orchestra] added punch and menace.\" Composer [[Bear McCreary]]'s use of the electric guitar was also reduced for the second season, while his general synth programming was changed from \"warm, round tones\" to \"mangled under heavy distortion\" sound.<ref name=\"McCrearyS2Begins\" />\n\nMcCreary introduced a new Hydra theme for the season, explaining that \"Last season got pretty musically complicated. I had a theme that associated itself with Centipede, The Clairvoyant, [[John Garrett (comics)|John Garrett]] and Raina. That theme ultimately functioned like a Hydra Theme. I had a theme for Victoria Hand that, while the audience briefly suspected her, also functioned as the Hydra Theme. I had a[nother] theme for Garrett that also acted like the theme for Hydra. It got so complicated ... The answer was obvious: I needed to write a new Hydra Theme, one that could be associated with Dr. Whitehall.\"<ref name=\"McCrearyS2Begins\" /> For Hayley Atwell's appearances as Peggy Carter, McCreary decided to quote the Agent Carter theme composed by [[Christopher Lennertz]] for the ''[[Agent Carter (film)|Agent Carter]]'' short film. On using Lennertz's theme, McCreary said, \"I was excited for the opportunity to incorporate his music into my S.H.I.E.L.D. score, because it further cements the Marvel [Cinematic] Universe together as a coherent whole ... Chris was thrilled and sent me his scores for reference.\"<ref name=\"McCrearyS2Begins\" /> A soundtrack featuring music from the first and second seasons was released by [[Marvel Music]] digitally on September 4, 2015, and on CD in October 2015.<ref name=\"SeriesSoundtrack\" /><ref name=\"SoundtrackiTunes\" />\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\nExecutive producer Maurissa Tancharoen stated the production team was not ruling out creating crossover episodes with ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Agent Carter]]'' or ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' during the season, with executive producer Jed Whedon adding that any such episodes would not equal the scale seen in the ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' crossover from the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 1)|first season]], saying, \"In terms of game-changers, [those episodes are] hard to beat.\"<ref name=\"Zap2ItJuly2014\" /> Bell later said ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' \"is coming up and we know what's going on with that and look forward to seeing it, but it's pretty cool to find ways to tie-in stuff and connect things.\"<ref name=\"BellSep2014\" /> In December 2014, ABC confirmed the series would tie-in with ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', with Whedon saying, \"You should expect something. ''The Avengers'' is the big tent that all the franchises play under. Obviously, we're included in that.\"<ref name=\"AoUTieIn\" /> The episodes \"The Frenemy of My Enemy\" and \"The Dirty Half Dozen\" feature \"Easter eggs, plot threads and other connective tissue leading into the opening scene of ''Avengers: Age of Ultron''\" while \"Scars\" explores the aftermath of the film.<ref name=\"AoUTieIn2\" />\n\nTalking on how the season would interact with ''Agent Carter'', Bell said, \"Here's what I think is interesting. ''Agent Carter'' seems to be about S.S.R. pre-S.H.I.E.L.D., but about the beginnings of something, and the basic values of that. S.H.I.E.L.D. got blown up last year and what Coulson always wanted was a return to basics, and it gives us an opportunity to return to some of those core values and even physically, some of that S.S.R. stuff has a way of finding its way into our show that could be cool. Anyway we can tie things together, we're going to try to do it, but it is hard when the stories are 60 years apart.\"<ref name=\"BellSep2014\" /> Several scenes in \"Shadows\" and \"The Things We Bury\" are flashbacks featuring Peggy Carter which serve as an introduction to the world of ''Agent Carter'', setting up characters and ideas for that series, including Carter's belief in the need for \"a permanent unit during peacetime\", which will lead to the creation of S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref name=\"ACcrossover\" /><ref name=\"Ep8Synopsis\" /> The episode \"Making Friends and Influencing People\" names Hydra's ability to brainwash people as the [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Faustus Method]],<ref name=\"Faustus1\" /><ref name=\"Faustus2\" /> named for the character who appears, as Johann Fennhoff, in ''Agent Carter'', played by [[Ralph Brown]].<ref name=\"Fennhoff\" />\n\nThe season confirms that the blue alien seen in the first season, and a recurring plot point this season, was a member of the [[Kree]] race, who play a significant role in ''Guardians of the Galaxy''.<ref name=\"BennetBellKree\" /> Whedon explained that \"We obviously showed this body a year ago at around this time. When we were breaking that and sussing out what this arc would be, we had to have a lot of the pieces in place from the get go ... we had to talk to features about what their plans were and where they were going.\" When asked whether this counts as the series tie-in to ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', Whedon said \"It is a very far away other galaxy, so it's a little bit harder to have one of them walk into our set, so a direct tie-in is a little bit more challenging, but it's all one universe, so there's always opportunity for more. ... In ''Guardians'', we saw parts in our universe that we hadn't explored yet, so it shows we're a part of that too.\"<ref name=\"EWKree\" /> This storyline also introduces the Inhumans to the MCU, ahead of their [[Inhumans (film)|own film]] that was planned.<ref name=\"SkyeReveal\" />\n\nAt the end of the season, Bell stated on the way that the season had tied in with the films, \"we got to be our own show and tell our own stories in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and do a nice hand off or a tie-in, but neither are incumbent upon the other to be a follow, and I think that's a great model for us.\"<ref name=\"BellVarietyFinale\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n[[File:Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. season 2 motion poster.gif|thumb|155px|left|A motion poster released in December 2014, showing the shift in focus from Hydra in the first half of the season to the Inhumans in the second.]]\nAt the [[San Diego Comic-Con International|2014 San Diego Comic-Con]], ahead of the premiere of the season, Marvel Custom Solutions and [[Lexus]] released a limited single-issue [[Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics|comic tie-in]] titled [[Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics#Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: The Chase (2014)|''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: The Chase'']],<ref name=\"AoSTC\" /> set between the Season 1 episodes \"Seeds\" and \"T.R.A.C.K.S.\",<ref name=\"AoSTC1\" /> written by George Kitson, and with art by  Mirko Colak, Neil Edwards, and Mirco Pierfederici.<ref name=\"AoSTCTeam\" /> On October 10, 2014, \"Face My Enemy\" was screened at [[New York Comic Con]].<ref name=\"NYCCEpisode\" />\n\n===\"The Art of Evolution\"===\nFor the final twelve episodes of the season, Marvel once again ran the \"Art of...\" initiative, in which a different image was released each Thursday before a new episode, depicting a first look at a key event from the upcoming episode, with the season's title being \"The Art of Evolution\". The different artists were once again chosen to create the teaser posters, based on their previous work and how it connected to the themes and emotion of the intended episode. On how what is shown on each poster is chosen, Bell said, \"maybe we'll show [the artist] the script or let them watch the episode and let them respond to it emotionally and see what's interesting to them. And then we have a conversation with them about how we'd like to portray that, and then we try to lean into the strengths that they have. Some are more graphic, some are more character based, some are more composite, and some are cleaner. And that's one of the things [the producers] really look forward to each week, getting the initial sketches back from the artists and seeing their interpretation.\"<ref name=\"AftershocksPoster\" /> The art once again appeared as [[variant cover]]s to select titles published by [[Marvel Comics]] in June 2015.<ref name=\"ArtEvolutionVariants\" />\n\nThe poster for \"Aftershocks\", created by [[Gabriele Dell'Otto]], the co-creator of Daisy Johnson, depicts Skye twice, as she is transforming from the Terrigen mist and as the person dealing with her powers, as well as a transformed Raina, Coulson and the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo in the background.<ref name=\"AftershocksPoster\" /> For \"Who You Really Are\", the producers enlisted [[Marcos Mart\u00edn]] to create the poster, which highlighted Sif's (Jaimie Alexander) return to the show, as well as an \"inside look\" at S.H.I.E.L.D. as the logo crumbles, with Skye in the center of it, ambiguously leaving the viewer questioning if the logo was crumbling due to Sif's sword, or Skye's powers.<ref name=\"WhoYouReallyArePoster\" /> The third poster, for \"One of Us\", was created by [[Declan Shalvey]] and [[Jordie Bellaire]]. It features muted colors and shows \"Coulson surrounded by villains [from the S.H.I.E.L.D. index], and the giant Cal looming over, and [a bird and] S.H.I.E.L.D. behind him.\"<ref name=\"OneofUsPoster\" /> Annie Wu was brought on for the \"Love in the Time of Hydra\" poster, which shows Grant Ward holding a woman, though depicts her as two; one drawn in red, the other in blue \u2013 \"half of that goes to Agent 33, who has two faces... And it also goes to the fact that she's been imitating other people as she did with Agent May.\"<ref name=\"LoveintheTimeofHydraPoster\" />\n\n\"One Door Closes\", an episode focused on Bobbi Morse's history, received a poster of her with the \"real S.H.I.E.L.D.\" logo, that \"embraced the basics\" of four-color printing, utilizing magenta, cyan, black and yellow, while still having layers and complications, much like the character of Morse. The poster was designed by Delicious Design League.<ref name=\"OneDoorClosesPoster\" /> The poster for \"Afterlife\" by Dave Johnson, highlights the divide within S.H.I.E.L.D. and the alliances on each side. With Coulson in the middle, Agents Gonzales, Morse, Mackenzie and Weaver stem from the \"real S.H.I.E.L.D.\", while Hunter, Fitz and Simmons stem from the other.<ref name=\"AfterlifePoster\" /> \"Melinda\"{{'}}s poster, by [[Jenny Frison]], mirrored the focus of the episode by prominently featuring an image of May, highlighting her backstory and why she is called \"the Cavalry\".<ref name=\"MelindaPoster\" /> Marvel teamed with Nathan Fox on the poster for \"The Frenemy of My Enemy\", which depicts Ward, Kara, and Bakshi in \"Hydra red\"; Coulson, Hunter, and Fitz in \"S.H.I.E.L.D. blue\"; and Deathlok neutral. They are all featured together, just as the season is \"starting to put [all of its plotlines] together in new combinations in new ways, [to] propel us into the last four episodes.\"<ref name=\"TheFrenemyofMyEnemyPoster\" />\n\nAs alluded to by the episode title, the poster for \"The Dirty Half Dozen\", with art by Jake Wyatt, sees the original recruits to Coulson's S.H.I.E.L.D. team from the first season (May, Ward, Fitz, Simmons and Skye), along with Coulson, together once again, suiting up for a mission together; it is also the first poster of the \"Art of...\" series to feature the episode title on the poster.<ref name=\"DirtyHalfDozenPoster\" /> Marguerite Sauvage provided the poster for \"Scars\", which prominently features Jiaying and her scars in a way that the series cannot do with special effects, while also depicting Skye near the former's stomach to cement the maternal connection between them.<ref name=\"ScarsPoster\" /> For Part One of the season finale, \"S.O.S\", [[Ryan Sook]]'s poster hints at Cal's transformation into the [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mr. Hyde]] persona from the comics, in an homage to traditional comic book covers.<ref name=\"SOS1Poster\" /> For Part Two, artist Joshua Budich brought together all of the main players of the season, divided into Coulson and his team, and those who served as antagonists to them throughout the season (though not necessarily villains), with Skye and some Terrigen crystals in the middle, pointing to Skye's confused allegiances and the importance of the crystals in the finale.<ref name=\"SOS2Poster\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Broadcast===\nIn June 2014, Clark Gregg stated he believed the season would be shown in a block of 10 episodes, then breaking for ''Agent Carter'', before airing the remaining 12.<ref name=\"S2EpisodeNumber\" /> Explaining this decision, Bell said, <blockquote>One of our challenges last year was to produce 22 episodes that aired over, what, 40 weeks? 36 weeks? Something like that. And the age of re-runs is dead. Re-runs are death, and so you're trying to commit to the habit of the show and [viewers] tune in to something else or a re-run and they'll get pissed off. They'll go away. What this allows us to do is minimize repeats. We're showing ten episodes, and there has to be a gap or two because it's physically impossible to produce ten shows and get through post production in time, we can't do that so there's going to be a Marvel special at some point. But pretty much every week you're showing up and we're there, and then instead of a repeat showing up mid-run and losing momentum, ''Agent Carter'' comes in and has its own cool stuff, and they're running eight weeks in a row, then we can come back and run twelve in a row with no interruptions. We're still producing our show every week but it just gives us time, barely, to finish 22 on schedule. It takes out the need for repeats in the back half.<ref name=\"BellSep2014\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe season began airing on September 23, 2014, on ABC in the United States,<ref name=\"2.01\" /> and on

He specifically highlighted the changes made to Fitz' character, saying \"This lair of tragedy greatly deepens Fitz's character and gives the comic relief of last season a heartbreaking edge.\"<ref name=\"DoGBuxtonPremiereReview\" /> James Hunt, also for ''Den of Geek'', gave a positive review as well, stating \"The momentum of last season's finale hasn't been lost, and indeed, it's even been added to. Last year I criticised the pilot episode for, above all else, failing to recreate the feel of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This year, it's only fair that I praise the season opener for doing exactly that.\"<ref name=\"DoGHuntPremiereReview\" /> Kevin Fitzpatrick at Screen Crush called the premiere \"unexpectedly good\", noting that the series \"remains as serialized a show as it can over 22 episodes\", introducing new and interesting ideas for the rest of the season, while also setting a high standard for subsequent episodes to meet.<ref name=\"ScreenCrushPremiereReview\" />\n\nAlan Sepinwall at HitFix called the episode a promising start to the season, \"a fairly lively hour in spite of [a lot of exposition], helped by some good casting and smart creative choices\". He was positive about both the changes to the existing characters and the introduction of the new ones, and though he noted that the opening sequence was \"itself a piece of brand extension \u2014 early promotion for ''Agent Carter'',\" he felt that \"Links to the rest of the Marvel [Cinematic U]niverse are always welcome when they're in service to the story the show is telling\".<ref name=\"HitFixPremiereReview\" /> Eric Goldman of [[IGN]] scored the episode an 8.3 out of 10, praising the visual style, which he called \"less glossy\" than previous episodes, as well as the introduction of new characters and development of old ones, especially the introduction of Carl Creel and the \"nicely done FX showing off his power\".<ref name=\"IGNPremiereReview\" /> Oliver Sava of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' graded the episode a 'B-', feeling that \"With a clearly defined villain and mission statement, this show's second season is already off to a better start than its first year, but there's still plenty of room for the series to grow. The scripts could use more energy, the action could be better choreographed, and it could use a huge injection of style for both the visual and audio elements. There's so much potential in ''Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' ... but the show's creators aren't fully exploring it yet.\"<ref name=\"AVClubPremiereReview\" />\n\nAt the end of the season, Goldman graded it an 8.2 out of 10, saying the season \"found the show much-improved, as it moved faster and delved deeper into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\" Compared to the first season, Goldman felt the \"pacing was hugely improved, with storylines no longer taking forever to bubble up again and secrets no longer being kept both from the audience and the characters,\" with content from the first season being resolved, while still introducing new plot lines and mysteries to play out over the season. He also praised the characterization improvement and called the season \"less restrained\" in connecting to its comics roots. While he appreciated the new characters that join the series, specifically MacLachlan's portrayal of Cal, he felt Triplett was \"never fully utilized\", which made his death in the midseason finale less impactful. Additionally, Goldman criticized the tie-in to ''Age of Ultron'', calling it \"forced\" and distracting from the Inhuman/S.H.I.E.L.D. 2.0 storylines.<ref name=\"IGNSeasonReview\" /> Nick Hogan at TV Overmind rated the season 9 out of 10 stars, calling it, \"for the most part, a very enjoyable season of television.\" Hogan praised that cast and characters, particularly MacLachlan's portrayal of Calvin Zabo, saying \"He had perhaps the strongest character arc of anyone this season, and it was such a pleasure to watch.\" He did criticize some of the story direction, feeling that it took a while for the Inhumans to connect to the rest of the series, and that the way the ''Age of Ultron'' tie-in concluded the S.H.I.E.L.D. vs. S.H.I.E.L.D. storyline was \"rushed and choppy\".<ref name=\"TVOvermindSeasonReview\" />\n\n===Analysis===\nThe season's introduction of the Inhumans and apparent willingness to establish new norms ahead of the films has been highlighted by critics:\n\nSava felt that having the series introduce the race made ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' \"an essential part of Marvel Studios' bigger plans for the future\", explaining that \"the series has become more and more connected to the larger MCU since ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', but it's always been in a reactive role. Stuff happens in the movies, and ''Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' deals with the fallout. Not anymore. This show is making things happen, and these events will clearly impact the future of the MCU because we know there's an ''Inhumans'' movie planned for 2019.\" Sava also mentioned that introducing the Inhumans \"on a personal level rather than a cosmic level\" via the television series makes \"the whole idea a bit easier to swallow\" for the general MCU audience.<ref name=\"SavaAnalysis\" />\n\nMerrill Barr of ''[[Forbes]]'' thought that by not only introducing the Inhumans ahead of the film, but by depicting the spreading of the race throughout the world, was part of the series cementing its \"right to exist\" apart from the films. Talking about the season finale, Barr said, \"''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' does a most excellent job of standing on its own two feet in a way we've never seen it do before. Come the final frame, all anyone \u2013 Marvel fan or otherwise \u2013 will be asking is when season three begins. The note the show leaves viewers on is one that will make them realize, perhaps for the first time, that the journey of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' is not only worth it now, but perhaps always has been.\"<ref name=\"BarrAnalysis\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 99%;\"\n|-\n!

The season is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) and acknowledges the continuity of [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the franchise's films]]. It was produced by [[ABC Studios]], [[Marvel Television]], and [[Mutant Enemy Productions]], with [[Jed Whedon]], [[Maurissa Tancharoen]], and [[Jeffrey Bell]] serving as [[showrunner]]s.\n\n[[Clark Gregg]] reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by series regulars [[Ming-Na Wen]], [[Brett Dalton]], [[Chloe Bennet]], [[Iain De Caestecker]], and [[Elizabeth Henstridge]]. ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' was picked up for a full season by ABC in May 2013, and filming took place primarily in Los Angeles. The main recurring setting of the season is the Bus, a retrofitted [[Boeing C-17]] plane that was designed by visual effects company FuseFX, and created with CGI. Some episodes of the season directly [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] with the films ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' (2013) and ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014), with the latter causing a major retooling of the season for its final six episodes. Several other actors also reprise their MCU roles in the season for guest appearances.\n\nThe season aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from September 24, 2013, to May 13, 2014, and consists of 22 episodes. Its [[Pilot (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|pilot episode]] was watched by 12.12 million viewers, the highest ratings received by the first episode of a drama series since 2009, but ratings decreased as the season progressed. The critical reception was initially mixed, but grew more positive in the second half of the season and particularly after the crossover with ''The Winter Soldier''.

Those were things we knew loosely.|source=\u2014Jeffrey Bell, executive producer, on the evolving nature of characters and story lines throughout the season.<ref name=\"BellSep2014\" />}}\nThe character arcs were laid out by the series' creative team, with Marvel's only guidelines being to work around ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'',<ref name=\"BuzzFeedMay2014\" /> which sees S.H.I.E.L.D. destroyed. Jed Whedon said on this, \"if someone told you that concept, you'd think it was a great thing to have happen at the beginning of the show or the end of Season 3. To have it happen in the middle of your first season is an interesting kind of riddle\". The writers worked to establish a \"regular day at S.H.I.E.L.D.\" and the existing hierarchy, and then \"to blow that up, we knew the way to best illustrate that was by putting it on a personal level with our main man Coulson\".<ref name=\"BuzzFeedMay2014\" /> Tancharoen elaborated that \"We see what it actually looks like for S.H.I.E.L.D. to crumble in ''Captain America 2'', we see the [[Helicarrier]]s literally barreling through the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]], we see the massive destruction throughout the city, but the benefit of our show is we get to dive into the emotional toll of that.\"<ref name=\"BuzzFeedMay2014\" /> Therefore, it was decided at the beginning of the series that one of the main characters would be a traitor, with Jed Whedon saying \"since this is an infiltration based on betrayal on a massive scale, we wanted to have it on the small scale, and have it be a really personal dagger to the heart.\"<ref name=\"BuzzFeedMay2014\" />\n\nOn whether it was Marvel's idea or the showrunner's to have Coulson promoted to Director and tasked with rebuilding S.H.I.E.L.D. at the end of the season, Jed Whedon said \"They're {{sic|one in}} the same. They have plans for films, and we have plans to intermingle with them, and it's the name of our show. The second to last episode is called \"Ragtag\", and that's a term we've used; we wanted to create this ragtag group, but within this giant organization with billions of dollars and support all over the globe and satellite feeds on their luxurious plane.

One of the storyboard artists, Warren Drummond, noted the process was different to that on films, because there was limited time to complete the work, and because the storyboard artists were often working with different directors for each episode. Most of the sequences storyboarded were action or science fiction sequences.<ref name=\"Storyboards\" />\n\nThe main recurring setting for the season is the Bus, a retrofitted [[Boeing C-17]], that serves as both the transportation and headquarters of the titular team. The Bus includes such features as a soundproof interrogation room, a forensics and research lab located on the lower deck, where Fitz and Simmons work, and a cargo hold directly outside the lab where the team parks its SUV and Lola, Coulson's prized [[Chevy Corvette|1962 Corvette]].<ref name=\"TVGuide3.10.14\" />\n\n===Filming===\nThe pilot was produced almost entirely in [[Los Angeles]] to accommodate Joss Whedon's busy schedule.<ref name=\"Jan2013LeeInterview2\" /> Subsequent episodes were also produced in Los Angeles,<ref name=\"Oct2013Armand\" /> as well as [[Culver City, California]],<ref name=\"VFX1\" /> though additional filming took place around the world, including in [[Paris]], [[France]], for \"[[Pilot (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Pilot]]\",<ref name=\"Oct2013Dalton\" /> and in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], for \"[[Eye Spy (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Eye Spy]]\".<ref name=\"Oct2013Armand\" />\n\nThe stunt coordinator for the season was Tanner Gill.<ref name=\"LacovaraInterview\" /> In September 2013, Ming-Na Wen talked about stunts and action scenes on the series, saying \"I have great stunt coordinators and choreographers to help me through every step and with the magic of filmmaking and editing, it all brings about her skills, to another level. That has to be very believable ... I think the hardest part is doing the actual stunts, the stunt-fighting. That's a whole other thing. I'm not really punching out the stunt guy, nor are they hitting me, so it's learning this dance, really, within the fight. It's how to pull back, how to take a hit and make it look real.<ref name=\"WenHitFix\" /> \n\nAs with many Marvel projects, secrecy was a big issue.  For instance, it was a challenge keeping Samuel L. Jackson's cameo in \"[[0-8-4]]\" a surprise due to \"this age of tweets and spoilers\".<ref name=\"BellOct2013\" /> The showrunners had been exposed to this while working on ''The Avengers'', but with their own series they were able to see \"all the details that go into keeping everything under lock and key\".<ref name=\"BuzzFeedMay2014\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nThe visual effects supervisor for the season was Mark Kolpack,<ref name=\"VFX1\" /> with Los Angeles-based visual effects company FuseFX the main visual effects vendor. Kevin Lingenfelser started the season focused on 2D supervising, but took over as lead in-house visual effects supervisor after episode eight from David Altenau. Two separate production management and creative teams were established to work on the show, with most of the episodes being worked on concurrently, either two or three at a time.<ref name=\"VFX2\" />\n\n[[File:The Bus from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.png|thumb|right|250px|The Bus is a modified C17 transport plane. The digital model used in the series was designed and created by FuseFX.|alt=Digital model of \"the Bus\" from the series.]]\nFor the Bus, Altenau explained that it \"has all kinds of S.H.I.E.L.D. technology that is revealed over time as the series progresses. This includes an extra wing and engines in the rear giving the plane the ability to operate vertically for take-offs and landings, and even mid-flight u-turns ... FuseFX was given the opportunity to design the Bus. The design included many features from the start, such as the ability to do vertical take-offs and landing\". FuseFX designed the Bus, and \"Extreme attention was paid when designing the textures and rigging for this asset. Half a dozen 8k maps make up the details on the plane which allows the camera to get right up to the surface of the plane without any loss of detail. A very complex rig controls every aspect of the plane from the landing gear, engine transformation, doors opening, lighting and even the wings have flex controls for the animators to sell the weight of this massive aircraft. When the engines are in vertical flight mode they have several degrees of rotation which gives the jet a lot of maneuvering ability.\"<ref name=\"VFX2\" /> \n\nFuseFX also worked on Lola, Coulson's \"vintage 1962 Corvette\" which was described as \"a classic car and beautiful in its own right, but through digital effects, Fuse has added hovercraft capabilities. When Coulson needs it, the wheel's rotate into a horizontal position, exposing hidden jet engine ducts that create lifting thrust through the rims of the tires, which double as turbo-fan blades. We worked closely with production to help design the mechanism and the look of the hovercraft engines. It's [[Stark Industries|Stark]] technology designed to be consistent with the period aspect of the car.\"<ref name=\"VFX2\" /> When the real Corvette is shown transitioning to its hover mode, volumetric dust, exhaust, and particle effects are added. Occasionally, FuseFX was required to use a fully digital model of the car, which matches the real vehicle precisely.<ref name=\"VFX1\" />\n\n===Music===\nIn addition to the series' main theme for Coulson, [[Bear McCreary]] composed several other themes that he used throughout the season: themes for Mike Peterson and Project: Centipede were introduced in \"Pilot\";<ref name=\"McCrearyPilot\" /> a theme for the Agents as a team was introduced in \"[[0-8-4]]\";<ref name=\"McCreary084\" /> the Skye theme was introduced in \"[[The Asset]]\";<ref name=\"McCrearyAsset\" /> a theme for both Fitz and Simmons together was introduced in \"[[FZZT]]\";<ref name=\"McCrearyFZZT\" /> a theme for Victoria Hand and The Hub, which served as the theme for 'Big S.H.I.E.L.D.', as opposed to Coulson's 'little S.H.I.E.L.D.' team, was introduced in \"[[The Hub (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|The Hub]]\".<ref name=\"McCrearyHub\" /> McCreary opted not to reprise any themes from the films during the season, notably composing his own themes for the [[Cosmic Cube#Film|Tesseract]] and [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], which he acknowledged had already appeared in several films.<ref name=\"McCreary084\" /><ref name=\"McCrearyWell\" /> A soundtrack featuring music from the first and second seasons, was released by [[Marvel Music]] digitally on September 4, 2015, and on CD in October 2015.<ref name=\"SeriesSoundtrack\" /><ref name=\"SoundtrackiTunes\" />\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\nIn June 2013, Clark Gregg explained how the series would tie into the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|Marvel Cinematic Universe films]]: \"...the exciting part is going to be seeing the way that ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' interacts with the S.H.I.E.L.D. component in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier|Captain America 2]]'', and the other movies, and whether those movies will then affect our show.\"<ref name=\"June2013GreggInterview\" /> Joss Whedon did state that the show would be autonomous from ''The Avengers'', saying \"It's gotta be a show that works for people who haven't seen the Marvel movies. It will please Marvel fans, I think.\"<ref name=\"Aug2012WhedonInterview\" /> He reiterated that sentiment in an interview at the 2012 [[Toronto International Film Festival]], explaining \"It's new characters. It needs to be its own thing. It needs to be adjacent [to ''The Avengers'']... What does S.H.I.E.L.D. have that the other superheroes don't? And that, to me, is that they're not superheroes, but they live in that universe. Even though they're a big organization, that [lack of powers] makes them underdogs, and that's interesting to me.\"<ref name=\"Sep2012WhedonInterview\" />\n\nUltimately, the season featured several tie-in episodes with Marvel Cinematic Universe films: the episode \"The Well\" takes place directly after the events of ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'';<ref name=\"EWNov2013\" /> the episode \"T.A.H.I.T.I.\" introduces the alien race the [[Kree]] to the MCU (confirmed as such in the second season), members of which play a significant role in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'';<ref name=\"BennetKree\" /><ref name=\"BennetBellKree\" /> and the episodes \"End of the Beginning\" and \"Turn, Turn, Turn\" revolve around the events of ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier''.<ref name=\"ZapNov2013\" /><ref name=\"HitfixPg1\" /> Due to ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' revealing that Hydra had infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. with sleeper agents, the season sees a retooling for the final six episodes. Regarding the synergy the show has with addressing events from the films, Loeb said \"It's an extremely unique experience that doesn't exist anywhere else out there in the entertainment business\". The characters face the Hydra issue head on, while experiencing trust issues within themselves. Jed Whedon added that the Hydra element, which the show could not mention until after the release of ''The Winter Soldier'' in order to avoid spoiling the film, also attempts to address the lack of characters from the comics, a complaint fans had throughout the season, while also tying established threats such as the Clairvoyant, Project Centipede, and Deathlok, back into Hydra.<ref name=\"USATodayHYDRA\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n[[File:Jeph Loeb, Jeffrey Bell and Clark Gregg at PaleyFest 2014.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Three men sitting, facing the camera. Jeph Loeb, on the left and Jeffery Bell, middle, have their hands touching, with Clark Gregg on the right with his leg crossed.|Executive producers Loeb (L) and Bell (M) along with Gregg (R) at PaleyFest 2014, where the episode \"End of the Beginning\" was screened.]]\nThree episodes were screened before their initial air dates: \"Pilot\" at [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] on July 19, 2013,<ref name=\"PilotComicCon\" /> \"Eye Spy\" at [[New York Comic Con]] on October 12, 2013,<ref name=\"EyeSpyComicCon\" /> and \"End of the Beginning\" at Marvel's PaleyFest panel for the series on March 23, 2014.<ref name=\"HitfixPg2\" /> Beginning with \"T.A.H.I.T.I.\", all episodes leading up to ''The Winter Soldier'' crossover were marketed as ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Uprising''.<ref name=\"Uprising\" /> On March 18, 2014, ABC aired a one-hour [[television special]] titled ''[[Marvel Cinematic Universe#Marvel Studios: Assembling a Universe|Marvel Studios: Assembling a Universe]]'' in the place of an ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' episode. The special included promotional footage for then unaired episodes of the season.<ref name=\"TVSpecial\" />\n\n===\"The Art of Level Seven\"===\nFor the final six episodes, Marvel began the \"''Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'': The Art of Level Seven\" initiative, in which a different image was released each Thursday before a new episode, depicting a first look at a key event from the upcoming episode. Bell stated that the initiative was a way to tie the series back to its comics roots, and was thought of at the beginning of the season. The production team tried to pair specific artists to the teaser posters based on their previous work and how it connected to the themes and emotion of the intended episode.<ref name=\"TurnTurnTurnPoster\" /> The art also appeared as [[variant cover]]s to select titles published by [[Marvel Comics]] in August 2014. Jeph Loeb stated, \"It's exciting to bring this art to life once more, exclusively at comic book stores, and to give fans a chance to own the ''Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' art in a different format.\"<ref name=\"ArtLevel7Variants\" />\n\nThe poster for \"Turn, Turn, Turn\", created by Mike Del Mundo, depicts a maze forming the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo and show title, with a rat inside, hinting ominously at S.H.I.E.L.D.'s corruption and a possible traitor.<ref name=\"TurnTurnTurnPoster\" /> The poster for \"Providence\", created by [[Paolo Rivera]], highlights the rise of [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] by showing a melded Hydra and S.H.I.E.L.D. logo, and depicts the team divided by Coulson, Raina, and Ward.<ref name=\"ProvidencePoster\" /> The poster for \"The Only Light in The Darkness\", created by Pascal Campion, focuses on Coulson and his cellist lover, Audrey, while also hinting at the villain for the episode, [[Blackout (Marcus Daniels)|Marcus Daniels]].<ref name=\"LightDarkPoster\" /> The poster for \"Nothing Personal\", created by Stephanie Hans,  highlights Skye and Ward in a depiction of a moment from the episode, with Deathlok looming over them, and the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo in the background.<ref name=\"NothingPersonalPoster\" /> The poster for \"Ragtag\", created by Emma R\u00edos, depicts significant moments in Ward's life, as well as Fitz\u2013Simmons in danger, and Skye looming behind the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo, as if she is a presence that Ward cannot seem to shake.<ref name=\"RagtagPoster\" /> The poster for \"Beginning of the End\", created by Phantom City Creative, is reminiscent of the first official poster released, with differences including the characters' order and clothing, the poster's coloring, a broken S.H.I.E.L.D. logo over Hydra's, and Ward being tinted by Hydra.<ref name=\"BeginningEndPoster\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Broadcast===\nAlong with the premiere in the United States on ABC, the season began airing in Canada on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] on September 24, 2013.<ref name=\"CanadianRatings\" /> In the United Kingdom, the season debuted three days later on [[Channel 4]],<ref name=\"UKRatings\" /> while it began airing on the [[Seven Network]] in Australia on October 2, 2013,<ref name=\"AUSBroadcast2\" /> and in New Zealand on [[TV2 (New Zealand)|TV2]] on February 16, 2014.<ref name=\"NewZealandRatings\" />\n\n===Home media===\nThe season was released on September 9, 2014, on [[Blu-ray]] and [[DVD]]. Bonus features included behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, a blooper reel, as well as the television special, ''[[Marvel Studios: Assembling a Universe]]''.<ref

name=\"PilotSep2013Numbers\" /> In Canada, the premiere saw 2.706 million viewers, the third highest viewership for the week on the network.<ref name=\"CanadianRatings\" /> In the United Kingdom, the episode debuted as the highest rated drama launch of the year,<ref name=\"UKRatings\" /> averaging 3.23 million viewers including the +1 channel and recordings viewed the same night, a share of 14.8 percent of people watching TV in the UK at the time.<ref name=\"UKRatings2\" /> The premiere in Australia was watched by 1.3 million viewers, the top show of the night.<ref name=\"AUSBroadcast2\" /> In New Zealand, the episode premiered to 326,790 viewers, the fourth highest show of the night, and the most watched show on TV2.<ref name=\"NewZealandRatings\" /> By the time the full season was picked up by ABC it ranked as the number one new series of the [[2013\u201314 United States network television schedule|2013\u201314 television season]] among adults 18\u201349.<ref name=\"S1pickup\" /> The season averaged 8.31 million total viewers, ranking 43rd among network series. It also had an average total 18-49 rating of 3.0, which was 20th.<ref name=\"S1AvgRatings\" />\n\n===Critical response===\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports an 88% approval rating with an average score of 7.83/10, based on 72 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"''Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' is sure to please comic book fans, but the strong ensemble and brisk pacing help to make this better-than-average superhero show accessible to non-fanboys as well.\"<ref name=\"RT\" /> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 74 out of 100 based on 33 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"<ref name=\"MC\" /> \n\n[[File:Agents of SHIELD - SDCC 2013.jpg|thumb|right|(L to R) Gregg, Wen, Dalton, Bennet and De Caestecker were among those on the 2013 San Diego Comic\u2013Con panel, where the pilot was screened to a positive crowd reaction.]]\nThe early screening of the pilot at San Diego Comic-Con International was met with a very positive reaction from the crowd.<ref name=\"PilotComicCon\" /> Critically, the initial screening of the pilot was met with mostly positive reviews, though ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} Brooks Barnes noted that \"what goes over well at Comic-Con does not necessarily work in the real world,\" especially on a network with \"''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]'' moms and ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' grandparents\".<ref name=\"NYTPilot\" /> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s initial reactions were that if everything that made the show appealing&mdash; its continuity with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, its continuance of ''The Avengers'' storyline, and Whedon's return to television, were stripped from it, the show would still work. However, they also questioned whether the show was accessible enough to attract a wider audience.<ref name=\"EWPilotInitial\" />\n\nEvan Valentine, writing for Collider, divided the season into highs and lows: highs included the ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' crossover, with Valentine noting that \"The creators had clearly known this moment was coming ... and did a great job of capitalizing [on] it,\" as well as other tie-ins with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and he praised Gregg's performance, stating \"What made us fall in love with the character from the first ''Iron Man'' to his death in ''The Avengers'' is still alive and kicking\"; lows of the season included the episodes before the ''Winter Soldier'' tie-in, with Valentine feeling that the series \"became the show that had to stall its developments and character building to make way for the [tie-in].\" He also criticized the rest of the main cast, though he did approve of the guest and supporting cast members, and he criticized the series' use of minor comic book characters and concepts, singling out the costume design for Deathlok as \"horrid\" and not scary.<ref name=\"ColliderSeasonReview\" /> Eric Goldman of [[IGN]] gave the season a 7.5 out of 10, calling it \"a fun, lighthearted, but fairly disposable piece of entertainment\", noting that it improved through the season, especially following the ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' tie-in, and that by the end of the season, the series \"was starting to come into its own\". Though he found the main cast's performances to all be good, and praised the strong guest and recurring stars, Goldman found the main characterizations to be weak during the first half of the season, and he also criticized the pacing of certain overarching plotlines, noting \"the mystery of Coulson's return, Skye's parentage, etc. \u2013 moved far too slow, with relatively minor revelations treated as though they were big reveals\".<ref name=\"IGNSeasonReview\" /> \n\n[[Jim Steranko]], an artist and writer who worked on the ''Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' comic between 1966 and 1968, was critical of the pilot episode, lamenting that \"the show had no menace, no tension.\"<ref name=\"Steranko\" /> For the second episode, Steranko said that it was \"too unfocused to be satisfying,\" but praised Jackson's cameo as Nick Fury as \"an electrifying reminder of what the series could and should be.\"<ref name=\"Steranko2\" /> In contrast, Steranko's opinion of some later episodes in the first season were more positive, congratulating the writer and director of \"The End of the Beginning\" for \"finding an entertaining, bravura groove that finally brings the concept to life\",<ref name=\"Steranko3\" /> and saying of the next episode \"I was concerned that last week's bravura transformation was only a fluke, but it was apparent from the opening moments that the exec lineup's new image-and-edit policy was in play.\"<ref name=\"Steranko4\" /> Overall, however, he found season one to be \"22 episodes of 'sanctified' plot and character crumbs being salted with terminally-sluggish velocity (into anemic 'standalone' stories)\".<ref name=\"Steranko5\" />\n\n===Analysis===\nBoth the way the series was affected by the destruction of S.H.I.E.L.D. in ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' and the way its characters are depicted rebuilding the organization have been noted by some:\n\nTerri Schwartz, writing for Zap2it following the airing of \"Nothing Personal\", called the series \"incredible\", stating that it \"got off to a rocky start\", but that changed once the ''Winter Soldier'' tie-in took place. Schwartz felt that the season earned many of its early criticisms from having to \"bide time\" until the crossover, but \"Now that it has the freedom to be the series it was always intended to, ''Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' has turned into a fantastic show. Its connection to Marvel's Cinematic Universe is clear: This is where viewers get to see the fallout of Hydra's S.H.I.E.L.D. infiltration. And the fact that the movie so influenced the show is game-changing in terms of how the mediums of film and television can be interwoven.\"<ref name=\"Zap2itSeasonReview\" />\n\nMerrill Barr, reviewing \"Beginning of the End\" for ''[[Forbes]]'', reiterated this sentiment, stating that \"the series finally stands its ground and stakes its claim as a member of the Marvel Cinematic Universe ... By establishing world changing consequences that don't just affect one MCU franchise, but all of them.\" He continues saying that \"what Marvel's daring to say with this season finale is \"everything we do matters, and you need to pay attention to all of it.\" ... It's been a long journey, and there's no question many viewers' patience wore thin toward the end, but that never stopped Marvel from pushing forward to one of the most entertaining hours of television this season and finally cementing a deserved place on the small screen.\"<ref name=\"ForbesSeasonReview\" />\n\nMary McNamara of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' felt that the series \"created a whole new sort of television show: One that must support, and change with, the plot twists of its film family ... never before has television been literally married to film, charged with filling in the back story and creating the connective tissue of an ongoing film franchise.\" She stated that the ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' crossover \"infused ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' with a new energy, and helped explain, perhaps, why the show took so long to find its footing\u2014in the writers' room at least ... That ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' was able to succeed as a story both independent and ancillary is all but miraculous.\" She concluded that the series \"is now not only a very good show in its own right, it's part of Marvel's multiplatform city-state. It faces a future of perpetual re-invention, and that puts it in the exhilarating first car of television's roller-coaster ride toward possible world domination.\"<ref name=\"LATimesSeasonReview\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 99%;\"\n|-\n!

The season is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) and acknowledges the continuity of [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the franchise's films]]. It was produced by [[ABC Studios]], [[Marvel Television]], and [[Mutant Enemy Productions]], with [[Jed Whedon]], [[Maurissa Tancharoen]], and [[Jeffrey Bell]] serving as [[showrunner]]s.\n\n[[Clark Gregg]] reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by series regulars [[Ming-Na Wen]], [[Brett Dalton]], [[Chloe Bennet]], [[Iain De Caestecker]], and [[Elizabeth Henstridge]]. ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' was picked up for a full season by ABC in May 2013, and filming took place primarily in Los Angeles. The main recurring setting of the season is the Bus, a retrofitted [[Boeing C-17]] plane that was designed by visual effects company FuseFX, and created with CGI. Some episodes of the season directly [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] with the films ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' (2013) and ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014), with the latter causing a major retooling of the season for its final six episodes. Several other actors also reprise their MCU roles in the season for guest appearances.\n\nThe season aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from September 24, 2013, to May 13, 2014, and consists of 22 episodes. Its [[Pilot (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|pilot episode]] was watched by 12.12 million viewers, the highest ratings received by the first episode of a drama series since 2009, but ratings decreased as the season progressed. The critical reception was initially mixed, but grew more positive in the second half of the season and particularly after the crossover with ''The Winter Soldier''. The series was renewed for a [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

Garrett accidentally discloses information that reveals himself as the true Clairvoyant, and is captured by Coulson and May.

Those were things we knew loosely.|source=\u2014Jeffrey Bell, executive producer, on the evolving nature of characters and story lines throughout the season.<ref name=\"BellSep2014\" />}}\nThe character arcs were laid out by the series' creative team, with Marvel's only guidelines being to work around ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'',<ref name=\"BuzzFeedMay2014\" /> which sees S.H.I.E.L.D. destroyed. Jed Whedon said on this, \"if someone told you that concept, you'd think it was a great thing to have happen at the beginning of the show or the end of Season 3. To have it happen in the middle of your first season is an interesting kind of riddle\". The writers worked to establish a \"regular day at S.H.I.E.L.D.\" and the existing hierarchy, and then \"to blow that up, we knew the way to best illustrate that was by putting it on a personal level with our main man Coulson\".<ref name=\"BuzzFeedMay2014\" /> Tancharoen elaborated that \"We see what it actually looks like for S.H.I.E.L.D. to crumble in ''Captain America 2'', we see the [[Helicarrier]]s literally barreling through the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]], we see the massive destruction throughout the city, but the benefit of our show is we get to dive into the emotional toll of that.\"<ref name=\"BuzzFeedMay2014\" /> Therefore, it was decided at the beginning of the series that one of the main characters would be a traitor, with Jed Whedon saying \"since this is an infiltration based on betrayal on a massive scale, we wanted to have it on the small scale, and have it be a really personal dagger to the heart.\"<ref name=\"BuzzFeedMay2014\" />\n\nOn whether it was Marvel's idea or the showrunner's to have Coulson promoted to Director and tasked with rebuilding S.H.I.E.L.D. at the end of the season, Jed Whedon said \"They're {{sic|one in}} the same. They have plans for films, and we have plans to intermingle with them, and it's the name of our show. The second to last episode is called \"Ragtag\", and that's a term we've used; we wanted to create this ragtag group, but within this giant organization with billions of dollars and support all over the globe and satellite feeds on their luxurious plane.

One of the storyboard artists, Warren Drummond, noted the process was different to that on films, because there was limited time to complete the work, and because the storyboard artists were often working with different directors for each episode. Most of the sequences storyboarded were action or science fiction sequences.<ref name=\"Storyboards\" />\n\nThe main recurring setting for the season is the Bus, a retrofitted [[Boeing C-17]], that serves as both the transportation and headquarters of the titular team. The Bus includes such features as a soundproof interrogation room, a forensics and research lab located on the lower deck, where Fitz and Simmons work, and a cargo hold directly outside the lab where the team parks its SUV and Lola, Coulson's prized [[Chevy Corvette|1962 Corvette]].<ref name=\"TVGuide3.10.14\" />\n\n===Filming===\nThe pilot was produced almost entirely in [[Los Angeles]] to accommodate Joss Whedon's busy schedule.<ref name=\"Jan2013LeeInterview2\" /> Subsequent episodes were also produced in Los Angeles,<ref name=\"Oct2013Armand\" /> as well as [[Culver City, California]],<ref name=\"VFX1\" /> though additional filming took place around the world, including in [[Paris]], [[France]], for \"[[Pilot (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Pilot]]\",<ref name=\"Oct2013Dalton\" /> and in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], for \"[[Eye Spy (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Eye Spy]]\".<ref name=\"Oct2013Armand\" />\n\nThe stunt coordinator for the season was Tanner Gill.<ref name=\"LacovaraInterview\" /> In September 2013, Ming-Na Wen talked about stunts and action scenes on the series, saying \"I have great stunt coordinators and choreographers to help me through every step and with the magic of filmmaking and editing, it all brings about her skills, to another level. That has to be very believable ... I think the hardest part is doing the actual stunts, the stunt-fighting. That's a whole other thing. I'm not really punching out the stunt guy, nor are they hitting me, so it's learning this dance, really, within the fight. It's how to pull back, how to take a hit and make it look real.<ref name=\"WenHitFix\" /> \n\nAs with many Marvel projects, secrecy was a big issue.  For instance, it was a challenge keeping Samuel L. Jackson's cameo in \"[[0-8-4]]\" a surprise due to \"this age of tweets and spoilers\".<ref name=\"BellOct2013\" /> The showrunners had been exposed to this while working on ''The Avengers'', but with their own series they were able to see \"all the details that go into keeping everything under lock and key\".<ref name=\"BuzzFeedMay2014\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nThe visual effects supervisor for the season was Mark Kolpack,<ref name=\"VFX1\" /> with Los Angeles-based visual effects company FuseFX the main visual effects vendor. Kevin Lingenfelser started the season focused on 2D supervising, but took over as lead in-house visual effects supervisor after episode eight from David Altenau. Two separate production management and creative teams were established to work on the show, with most of the episodes being worked on concurrently, either two or three at a time.<ref name=\"VFX2\" />\n\n[[File:The Bus from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.png|thumb|right|250px|The Bus is a modified C17 transport plane.

FuseFX was given the opportunity to design the Bus. The design included many features from the start, such as the ability to do vertical take-offs and landing\". FuseFX designed the Bus, and \"Extreme attention was paid when designing the textures and rigging for this asset. Half a dozen 8k maps make up the details on the plane which allows the camera to get right up to the surface of the plane without any loss of detail. A very complex rig controls every aspect of the plane from the landing gear, engine transformation, doors opening, lighting and even the wings have flex controls for the animators to sell the weight of this massive aircraft. When the engines are in vertical flight mode they have several degrees of rotation which gives the jet a lot of maneuvering ability.\"<ref name=\"VFX2\" /> \n\nFuseFX also worked on Lola, Coulson's \"vintage 1962 Corvette\" which was described as \"a classic car and beautiful in its own right, but through digital effects, Fuse has added hovercraft capabilities. When Coulson needs it, the wheel's rotate into a horizontal position, exposing hidden jet engine ducts that create lifting thrust through the rims of the tires, which double as turbo-fan blades. We worked closely with production to help design the mechanism and the look of the hovercraft engines. It's [[Stark Industries|Stark]] technology designed to be consistent with the period aspect of the car.\"<ref name=\"VFX2\" /> When the real Corvette is shown transitioning to its hover mode, volumetric dust, exhaust, and particle effects are added. Occasionally, FuseFX was required to use a fully digital model of the car, which matches the real vehicle precisely.<ref name=\"VFX1\" />\n\n===Music===\nIn addition to the series' main theme for Coulson, [[Bear McCreary]] composed several other themes that he used throughout the season: themes for Mike Peterson and Project: Centipede were introduced in \"Pilot\";<ref name=\"McCrearyPilot\" /> a theme for the Agents as a team was introduced in \"[[0-8-4]]\";<ref name=\"McCreary084\" /> the Skye theme was introduced in \"[[The Asset]]\";<ref name=\"McCrearyAsset\" /> a theme for both Fitz and Simmons together was introduced in \"[[FZZT]]\";<ref name=\"McCrearyFZZT\" /> a theme for Victoria Hand and The Hub, which served as the theme for 'Big S.H.I.E.L.D.', as opposed to Coulson's 'little S.H.I.E.L.D.' team, was introduced in \"[[The Hub (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|The Hub]]\".<ref name=\"McCrearyHub\" /> McCreary opted not to reprise any themes from the films during the season, notably composing his own themes for the [[Cosmic Cube#Film|Tesseract]] and [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], which he acknowledged had already appeared in several films.<ref name=\"McCreary084\" /><ref name=\"McCrearyWell\" /> A soundtrack featuring music from the first and second seasons, was released by [[Marvel Music]] digitally on September 4, 2015, and on CD in October 2015.<ref name=\"SeriesSoundtrack\" /><ref name=\"SoundtrackiTunes\" />\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\nIn June 2013, Clark Gregg explained how the series would tie into the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|Marvel Cinematic Universe films]]: \"...the exciting part is going to be seeing the way that ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' interacts with the S.H.I.E.L.D. component in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier|Captain America 2]]'', and the other movies, and whether those movies will then affect our show.\"<ref name=\"June2013GreggInterview\" /> Joss Whedon did state that the show would be autonomous from ''The Avengers'', saying \"It's gotta be a show that works for people who haven't seen the Marvel movies. It will please Marvel fans, I think.\"<ref name=\"Aug2012WhedonInterview\" /> He reiterated that sentiment in an interview at the 2012 [[Toronto International Film Festival]], explaining \"It's new characters. It needs to be its own thing. It needs to be adjacent [to ''The Avengers'']... What does S.H.I.E.L.D. have that the other superheroes don't? And that, to me, is that they're not superheroes, but they live in that universe. Even though they're a big organization, that [lack of powers] makes them underdogs, and that's interesting to me.\"<ref name=\"Sep2012WhedonInterview\" />\n\nUltimately, the season featured several tie-in episodes with Marvel Cinematic Universe films: the episode \"The Well\" takes place directly after the events of ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'';<ref name=\"EWNov2013\" /> the episode \"T.A.H.I.T.I.\" introduces the alien race the [[Kree]] to the MCU (confirmed as such in the second season), members of which play a significant role in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'';<ref name=\"BennetKree\" /><ref name=\"BennetBellKree\" /> and the episodes \"End of the Beginning\" and \"Turn, Turn, Turn\" revolve around the events of ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier''.<ref name=\"ZapNov2013\" /><ref name=\"HitfixPg1\" /> Due to ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' revealing that Hydra had infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. with sleeper agents, the season sees a retooling for the final six episodes. Regarding the synergy the show has with addressing events from the films, Loeb said \"It's an extremely unique experience that doesn't exist anywhere else out there in the entertainment business\". The characters face the Hydra issue head on, while experiencing trust issues within themselves. Jed Whedon added that the Hydra element, which the show could not mention until after the release of ''The Winter Soldier'' in order to avoid spoiling the film, also attempts to address the lack of characters from the comics, a complaint fans had throughout the season, while also tying established threats such as the Clairvoyant, Project Centipede, and Deathlok, back into Hydra.<ref name=\"USATodayHYDRA\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n[[File:Jeph Loeb, Jeffrey Bell and Clark Gregg at PaleyFest 2014.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Three men sitting, facing the camera.

The special included promotional footage for then unaired episodes of the season.<ref name=\"TVSpecial\" />\n\n===\"The Art of Level Seven\"===\nFor the final six episodes, Marvel began the \"''Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'': The Art of Level Seven\" initiative, in which a different image was released each Thursday before a new episode, depicting a first look at a key event from the upcoming episode. Bell stated that the initiative was a way to tie the series back to its comics roots, and was thought of at the beginning of the season. The production team tried to pair specific artists to the teaser posters based on their previous work and how it connected to the themes and emotion of the intended episode.<ref name=\"TurnTurnTurnPoster\" /> The art also appeared as [[variant cover]]s to select titles published by [[Marvel Comics]] in August 2014. Jeph Loeb stated, \"It's exciting to bring this art to life once more, exclusively at comic book stores, and to give fans a chance to own the ''Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' art in a different format.\"<ref name=\"ArtLevel7Variants\" />\n\nThe poster for \"Turn, Turn, Turn\", created by Mike Del Mundo, depicts a maze forming the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo and show title, with a rat inside, hinting ominously at S.H.I.E.L.D.'s corruption and a possible traitor.<ref name=\"TurnTurnTurnPoster\" /> The poster for \"Providence\", created by [[Paolo Rivera]], highlights the rise of [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] by showing a melded Hydra and S.H.I.E.L.D. logo, and depicts the team divided by Coulson, Raina, and Ward.<ref name=\"ProvidencePoster\" /> The poster for \"The Only Light in The Darkness\", created by Pascal Campion, focuses on Coulson and his cellist lover, Audrey, while also hinting at the villain for the episode, [[Blackout (Marcus Daniels)|Marcus Daniels]].<ref name=\"LightDarkPoster\" /> The poster for \"Nothing Personal\", created by Stephanie Hans,  highlights Skye and Ward in a depiction of a moment from the episode, with Deathlok looming over them, and the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo in the background.<ref name=\"NothingPersonalPoster\" /> The poster for \"Ragtag\", created by Emma R\u00edos, depicts significant moments in Ward's life, as well as Fitz\u2013Simmons in danger, and Skye looming behind the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo, as if she is a presence that Ward cannot seem to shake.<ref name=\"RagtagPoster\" /> The poster for \"Beginning of the End\", created by Phantom City Creative, is reminiscent of the first official poster released, with differences including the characters' order and clothing, the poster's coloring, a broken S.H.I.E.L.D. logo over Hydra's, and Ward being tinted by Hydra.<ref name=\"BeginningEndPoster\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Broadcast===\nAlong with the premiere in the United States on ABC, the season began airing in Canada on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] on September 24, 2013.<ref name=\"CanadianRatings\" /> In the United Kingdom, the season debuted three days later on [[Channel 4]],<ref name=\"UKRatings\" /> while it began airing on the [[Seven Network]] in Australia on October 2, 2013,<ref name=\"AUSBroadcast2\" /> and in New Zealand on [[TV2 (New Zealand)|TV2]] on February 16, 2014.<ref name=\"NewZealandRatings\" />\n\n===Home media===\nThe season was released on September 9, 2014, on [[Blu-ray]] and [[DVD]].

name=\"PilotSep2013Numbers\" /> In Canada, the premiere saw 2.706 million viewers, the third highest viewership for the week on the network.<ref name=\"CanadianRatings\" /> In the United Kingdom, the

In New Zealand, the episode premiered to 326,790 viewers, the fourth highest show of the night, and the most watched show on TV2.<ref name=\"NewZealandRatings\" /> By the time the full season was picked up by ABC it ranked as the number one new series of the [[2013\u201314 United States network television schedule|2013\u201314 television season]] among adults 18\u201349.<ref name=\"S1pickup\" /> The season averaged 8.31 million total viewers, ranking 43rd among network series. It also had an average total 18-49 rating of 3.0, which was 20th.<ref name=\"S1AvgRatings\" />\n\n===Critical response===\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports an 88% approval rating with an average score of 7.83/10, based on 72 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"''Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' is sure to please comic book fans, but the strong ensemble and brisk pacing help to make this better-than-average superhero show accessible to non-fanboys as well.\"<ref name=\"RT\" /> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 74 out of 100 based on 33 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"<ref name=\"MC\" /> \n\n[[File:Agents of SHIELD - SDCC 2013.jpg|thumb|right|(L to R) Gregg, Wen, Dalton, Bennet and De Caestecker were among those on the 2013 San Diego Comic\u2013Con panel, where the pilot was screened to a positive crowd reaction.]]\nThe early screening of the pilot at San Diego Comic-Con International was met with a very positive reaction from the crowd.<ref name=\"PilotComicCon\" /> Critically, the initial screening of the pilot was met with mostly positive reviews, though ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} Brooks Barnes noted that \"what goes over well at Comic-Con does not necessarily work in the real world,\" especially on a network with \"''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]'' moms and ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' grandparents\".<ref name=\"NYTPilot\" /> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s initial reactions were that if everything that made the show appealing&mdash; its continuity with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, its continuance of ''The Avengers'' storyline, and Whedon's return to television, were stripped from it, the show would still work. However, they also questioned whether the show was accessible enough to attract a wider audience.<ref name=\"EWPilotInitial\" />\n\nEvan Valentine, writing for Collider, divided the season into highs and lows: highs included the ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' crossover, with Valentine noting that \"The creators had clearly known this moment was coming ... and did a great job of capitalizing [on] it,\" as well as other tie-ins with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and he praised Gregg's performance, stating \"What made us fall in love with the character from the first ''Iron Man'' to his death in ''The Avengers'' is still alive and kicking\"; lows of the season included the episodes before the ''Winter Soldier'' tie-in, with Valentine feeling that the series \"became the show that had to stall its developments and character building to make way for the [tie-in].\" He also criticized the rest of the main cast, though he did approve of the guest and supporting cast members, and he criticized the series' use of minor comic book characters and concepts, singling out the costume design for Deathlok as \"horrid\" and not scary.<ref name=\"ColliderSeasonReview\" /> Eric Goldman of [[IGN]] gave the season a 7.5 out of 10, calling it \"a fun, lighthearted, but fairly disposable piece of entertainment\", noting that it improved through the season, especially following the ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' tie-in, and that by the end of the season, the series \"was starting to come into its own\". Though he found the main cast's performances to all be good, and praised the strong guest and recurring stars, Goldman found the main characterizations to be weak during the first half of the season, and he also criticized the pacing of certain overarching plotlines, noting \"the mystery of Coulson's return, Skye's parentage, etc. \u2013 moved far too slow, with relatively minor revelations treated as though they were big reveals\".<ref name=\"IGNSeasonReview\" /> \n\n[[Jim Steranko]], an artist and writer who worked on the ''Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' comic between 1966 and 1968, was critical of the pilot episode, lamenting that \"the show had no menace, no tension.\"<ref name=\"Steranko\" /> For the second episode, Steranko said that it was \"too unfocused to be satisfying,\" but praised Jackson's cameo as Nick Fury as \"an electrifying reminder of what the series could and should be.\"<ref name=\"Steranko2\" /> In contrast, Steranko's opinion of some later episodes in the first season were more positive, congratulating the writer and director of \"The End of the Beginning\" for \"finding an entertaining, bravura groove that finally brings the concept to life\",<ref name=\"Steranko3\" /> and saying of the next episode \"I was concerned that last week's bravura transformation was only a fluke, but it was apparent from the opening moments that the exec lineup's new image-and-edit policy was in play.\"<ref name=\"Steranko4\" /> Overall, however, he found season one to be \"22 episodes of 'sanctified' plot and character crumbs being salted with terminally-sluggish velocity (into anemic 'standalone' stories)\".<ref name=\"Steranko5\" />\n\n===Analysis===\nBoth the way the series was affected by the destruction of S.H.I.E.L.D. in ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' and the way its characters are depicted rebuilding the organization have been noted by some:\n\nTerri Schwartz, writing for Zap2it following the airing of \"Nothing Personal\", called the series \"incredible\", stating that it \"got off to a rocky start\", but that changed once the ''Winter Soldier'' tie-in took place. Schwartz felt that the season earned many of its early criticisms from having to \"bide time\" until the crossover, but \"Now that it has the freedom to be the series it was always intended to, ''Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' has turned into a fantastic show. Its connection to Marvel's Cinematic Universe is clear: This is where viewers get to see the fallout of Hydra's S.H.I.E.L.D. infiltration. And the fact that the movie so influenced the show is game-changing in terms of how the mediums of film and television can be interwoven.\"<ref name=\"Zap2itSeasonReview\" />\n\nMerrill Barr, reviewing \"Beginning of the End\" for ''[[Forbes]]'', reiterated this sentiment, stating that \"the series finally stands its ground and stakes its claim as a member of the Marvel Cinematic Universe ... By establishing world changing consequences that don't just affect one MCU franchise, but all of them.\" He continues saying that \"what Marvel's daring to say with this season finale is \"everything we do matters, and you need to pay attention to all of it.\" ... It's been a long journey, and there's no question many viewers' patience wore thin toward the end, but that never stopped Marvel from pushing forward to one of the most entertaining hours of television this season and finally cementing a deserved place on the small screen.\"<ref name=\"ForbesSeasonReview\" />\n\nMary McNamara of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' felt that the series \"created a whole new sort of television show: One that must support, and change with, the plot twists of its film family ... never before has television been literally married to film, charged with filling in the back story and creating the connective tissue of an ongoing film franchise.\" She stated that the ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' crossover \"infused ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' with a new energy, and helped explain, perhaps, why the show took so long to find its footing\u2014in the writers' room at least ... That ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' was able to succeed as a story both independent and ancillary is all but miraculous.\" She concluded that the series \"is now not only a very good show in its own right, it's part of Marvel's multiplatform city-state. It faces a future of perpetual re-invention, and that puts it in the exhilarating first car of television's roller-coaster ride toward possible world domination.\"<ref name=\"LATimesSeasonReview\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 99%;\"\n|-\n!

Under the direction of his father, he completed his first film at 13; in college he studied economics with the goal of continuing his father's business, but an interest in class issues distracted him from that path. He met photographer [[Germaine Krull]] in Berlin in 1923, and entered into a [[marriage of convenience]] with her between 1927 and 1943 so that Krull could hold a Dutch passport and could have a \"veneer of married respectability without sacrificing her autonomy.\"<ref>Sichel, Kim. ''Germaine Krull: Photographer of Modernity''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1999. Pages 41 and 70. {{ISBN|0-262-19401-5}}.</ref>\n\nOriginally his work focused on technique, especially in ''[[Rain (1929 film)|Rain]]'' (''Regen'', 1929), a 10-minute short filmed over 2 years, and in ''[[De brug|The Bridge]]'' (''De Brug'', 1928). Around this time, along with [[Menno ter Braak]] and others, he was involved in the creation of the Dutch Film League ([[:nl:De Nederlandsche Filmliga|''De Nederlandsche Filmliga'']]) based in Amsterdam. The League drew foreign filmmakers to the Netherlands such as [[Alberto Cavalcanti]], [[Ren\u00e9 Clair]], [[Sergei Eisenstein]], [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]], and [[Dziga Vertov]], who also became his friends.\n\nIn 1929, Ivens went to the Soviet Union and was invited to direct a film on a topic of his own choosing which was the new industrial city of [[Magnitogorsk]]. Before commencing work, he returned to the Netherlands to make ''Industrial Symphony'' for Philips Electric which is considered to be a film of great technical beauty.<ref>Erik Barnouw. Documentary. New York: Oxford University Press, 2nd revised edition, 1993. pp.: 133-134</ref> He returned to the Soviet Union to make the film about Magnitogorsk, ''Song of Heroes '' in 1931 with music composed by [[Hanns Eisler]]. This was the first film on which Ivens and Eisler worked together. It was a propaganda film about this new industrial city where masses of forced laborers and communist youth worked for Stalin's Five Year Plan.\nWith [[Henri Storck]], Ivens made ''[[Mis\u00e8re au Borinage]]'' (''Borinage'', 1933), a documentary on life in a coal mining region. In 1943, he also directed two Allied propaganda films for the [[National Film Board of Canada]], including ''Action Stations'', about the [[Royal Canadian Navy]]'s escorting of convoys in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].<ref>[http://www.nfb.ca/collection/films/resultat.php?type=fonction&idFcr=7845&idFct=01&nom=Joris+Ivens&nomfunc=Director]</ref>\n\n==U.S. and World War II-era career==\nFrom 1936 to 1945, Ivens was based in the United States. For [[Pare Lorentz]]'s [[U.S. Film Service]], in the year 1940, he made a documentary film on [[rural electrification]] called ''Power and the Land''. It focused on a family, the Parkinsons, who ran a business providing milk for their community. The film showed the problem in the lack of electricity and the way the problem was fixed. Ivens was, however, known for his anti-[[fascism|fascist]] and other [[propaganda film]]s, including ''[[The Spanish Earth]]'', for the Spanish [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republicans]], co-written with [[Ernest Hemingway]] and music by [[Marc Blitzstein]] and [[Virgil Thomson]]. [[Jean Renoir]] did the French narration for the film and Hemingway did the English version only after [[Orson Welles]]' sounded too theatrical.. This film was financed by [[Archibald MacLeish]], [[Fredric March]], [[Florence Eldridge]], [[Lillian Hellman]], [[Luise Rainer]], [[Dudley Nichols]], [[Franchot Tone]] and other Hollywood movie stars, moguls, and writers who composed a group known as the [[Contemporary Historians]]. '' Spanish Earth '' was shown at the [[White House]] on July 8, 1937 after Ivens, Hemingway, [[Martha Gellhorn]], had had dinner with President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and [[Harry Hopkins]]. The Roosevelts loved the film but said that it needed more propaganda.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} This 1937 documentary was considered his masterpiece.<ref name=NYTobit/>\n\nIn 1938 he traveled to China. ''[[The 400 Million]]'' (1939) depicted the history of modern China and the Chinese resistance during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], including dramatic shots of the [[Battle of Taierzhuang]]. [[Robert Capa]] did camerawork, [[Sidney Lumet]] worked on the film as a reader, [[Hanns Eisler]] wrote the musical score, and [[Fredric March]] provided the narration. It, too, had been financed by the same people as those of ''Spanish Earth''. Its chief fundraiser was [[Luise Rainer]], recipient of the best actress [[Academy Award|Oscar]] two years in a row; and the entire group called themselves this time, ''History Today, Inc ''. The [[Guomindang]] government censored the film, fearing that it would give too much credit to left-wing forces.<ref>European Foundation Joris Ivens.

''A Memoir: Travels with Myself and Another''. New York: Penguin Putnam, Inc, 1978. p.:52</ref>\n\nIn early 1943, [[Frank Capra]] hired Ivens to supervise the production of ''Know Your Enemy: Japan '' for his U.S. War Department film series ''[[Why We Fight]]''. The film's commentary was written largely by [[Carl Foreman]]. Capra fired Ivens from the project because he felt that his approach was too sympathetic toward the Japanese. The film's release was held up because there were concerns that [[Emperor Hirohito]] was being depicted as a war criminal, and there was a policy shift to portray the Emperor more favorably after the war{{dubious|This probably only concerned the last episode? All were shot before Japan's surrender! Or is it misleading, and meant to say: the US took into consideration in advance what the post-war impact might be?|date=April 2020}} as a means of maintaining order in post-war Japan.\n\nWith the emerging \"Red Scare\" of the late 1940s, Ivens was forced to leave the country in the early months of the Truman administration. Ivens' leftist politics also put the kibosh on his first feature film project which was to have starred [[Greta Garbo]]. In fact, [[Walter Wanger]], the film's producer, was adamant about \"running [Ivens] out of town.\"\n\n== Return to Europe ==\n\nIn 1946, commissioned to make a Dutch film about Indonesian 'independence', Ivens resigned in protest over what he considered ongoing [[imperialism]]; the Dutch were in his view resisting decolonization. Instead, Ivens filmed ''[[Indonesia Calling]]'' in secret, for which he received funding from the [[International Workers Order]].<ref name=Musser>\n{{cite journal\n| first = Charles\n| last = Musser\n| authorlink = Charles Musser\n| title = Carl Marzani and Union Films: Making Left-Wing Documentaries during the Cold War, 1946\u201353\n| journal = The Moving Image\n| publisher = University of Minnesota Press\n| url = http://www.charlesmusser.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Musser-MarzaniandUnionFilms.pdf\n| pages = 104-160, 124 (Indonesia Calling)\n| date = 2009\n| accessdate = 26 January 2020}}</ref> For around a decade Ivens lived in Eastern Europe, working for several studios there. His position concerning Indonesia and his taking sides for the [[Eastern Bloc]] in the [[Cold War]] annoyed the Dutch government. Over a period of many years, he was obliged to renew his passport every three or four months. According to later mythology however, he lost his passport for ten years, which is not true, as demonstrated by the fact that he was able to travel to New York City to sit by the bedside of his old friend [[Paul Robeson]] when he was ill.\n\nFrom 1965 to 1970 he filmed two propaganda films about North Vietnam during the war: he made ''[[17e parall\u00e8le: La guerre du peuple]]'' ''(17th Parallel: Vietnam in War)'' and he participated in the collective work ''[[Loin du Vietnam]]'' (''Far from Vietnam''). He was awarded the [[Lenin Peace Prize]] for the year 1967.\n\nFrom 1971 to 1977, he shot ''[[How Yukong Moved the Mountains]]'', a 763-minute propaganda documentary about the [[Cultural Revolution]] in China. He was given unprecedented access because of his pro-communist views and his old personal friendships with [[Zhou Enlai]] and [[Mao Zedong]].\n\nHe spoke to [[Radio Netherlands]] about his life and work in a wide-ranging interview.<ref>[http://www.radionetherlandsarchives.org/vip-lounge-joris-ivens/ \"VIP Lounge - Joris Ivens\", Radio Netherlands Archives, June 7, 1989]</ref>\n\nIn 1988 Ivens received the [[Golden Lion|Golden Lion Honorary Award]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://ivens.nl/en/biographie|website=Joris Ivens Archive|accessdate=9 June 2017}}</ref> He then received the [[Order of the Netherlands Lion]] in January 1989, and died on 28 June that year.

Under the direction of his father, he completed his first film at 13; in college he studied economics with the goal of continuing his father's business, but an interest in class issues distracted him from that path. He met photographer [[Germaine Krull]] in Berlin in 1923, and entered into a [[marriage of convenience]] with her between 1927 and 1943 so that Krull could hold a Dutch passport and could have a \"veneer of married respectability without sacrificing her autonomy.\"<ref>Sichel, Kim. ''Germaine Krull: Photographer of Modernity''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1999. Pages 41 and 70.  {{ISBN|0-262-19401-5}}.</ref>\n\nOriginally his work focused on technique, especially in ''[[Rain (1929 film)|Rain]]'' (''Regen'', 1929), a 10-minute short filmed over 2 years, and in ''[[De brug|The Bridge]]''  (''De Brug'', 1928).  Around this time, along with [[Menno ter Braak]] and others, he was involved in the creation of the Dutch Film League ([[:nl:De Nederlandsche Filmliga|''De Nederlandsche Filmliga'']]) based in Amsterdam.  The League drew foreign filmmakers to the Netherlands such as [[Alberto Cavalcanti]], [[Ren\u00e9 Clair]], [[Sergei Eisenstein]], [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]], and [[Dziga Vertov]], who also became his friends.\n\nIn 1929, Ivens went to the Soviet Union and was invited to direct a film on a topic of his own choosing which was the new industrial city of [[Magnitogorsk]].  Before commencing work, he returned to the Netherlands to make ''Industrial Symphony'' for Philips Electric which is considered to be a film of great technical beauty.<ref>Erik Barnouw. Documentary. New York: Oxford University Press, 2nd revised edition, 1993. pp.: 133-134</ref> He returned to the Soviet Union to make the film about Magnitogorsk, ''Song of Heroes '' in 1931 with music composed by [[Hanns Eisler]]. This was the first film on which Ivens and Eisler worked together. It was a propaganda film about this new industrial city where masses of forced laborers and communist youth worked for Stalin's Five Year Plan.\nWith [[Henri Storck]], Ivens made ''[[Mis\u00e8re au Borinage]]'' (''Borinage'', 1933), a documentary on life in a coal mining region. In 1943, he also directed two Allied propaganda films for the [[National Film Board of Canada]], including ''Action Stations'', about the [[Royal Canadian Navy]]'s escorting of convoys in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].<ref>[http://www.nfb.ca/collection/films/resultat.php?type=fonction&idFcr=7845&idFct=01&nom=Joris+Ivens&nomfunc=Director]</ref>\n\n==U.S. and World War II-era career==\nFrom 1936 to 1945, Ivens was based in the United States.  For [[Pare Lorentz]]'s [[U.S. Film Service]], in the year 1940, he made a documentary film on [[rural electrification]] called ''Power and the Land''. It focused on a family, the Parkinsons, who ran a business providing milk for their community. The film showed the problem in the lack of electricity and the way the problem was fixed. Ivens was, however, known for his anti-[[fascism|fascist]] and other [[propaganda film]]s, including ''[[The Spanish Earth]]'', for the Spanish [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republicans]], co-written with [[Ernest Hemingway]] and music by [[Marc Blitzstein]] and [[Virgil Thomson]].  [[Jean Renoir]] did the French narration for the film and Hemingway did the English version only after [[Orson Welles]]' sounded too theatrical.. This film was financed by [[Archibald MacLeish]], [[Fredric March]], [[Florence Eldridge]], [[Lillian Hellman]], [[Luise Rainer]], [[Dudley Nichols]], [[Franchot Tone]] and other Hollywood movie stars, moguls, and writers who composed a group known as the [[Contemporary Historians]].  '' Spanish Earth '' was shown at the [[White House]] on July 8, 1937 after Ivens, Hemingway, [[Martha Gellhorn]], had had dinner with President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and [[Harry Hopkins]]. The Roosevelts loved the film but said that it needed more propaganda.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} This 1937 documentary was considered his masterpiece.<ref name=NYTobit/>\n\nIn 1938 he traveled to China. ''[[The 400 Million]]'' (1939) depicted the history of modern China and the Chinese resistance during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], including dramatic shots of the [[Battle of Taierzhuang]]. [[Robert Capa]] did camerawork, [[Sidney Lumet]] worked on the film as a reader, [[Hanns Eisler]] wrote the musical score, and [[Fredric March]] provided the narration. It, too, had been financed by the same people as those of  ''Spanish Earth''.  Its chief fundraiser was [[Luise Rainer]], recipient of the best actress [[Academy Award|Oscar]] two years in a row; and the entire group called themselves this time, ''History Today, Inc ''. The [[Guomindang]] government censored the film, fearing that it would give too much credit to left-wing forces.<ref>European Foundation Joris Ivens.

''A Memoir: Travels with Myself and Another''. New York: Penguin Putnam, Inc, 1978. p.:52</ref>\n\nIn early 1943, [[Frank Capra]] hired Ivens to supervise the production of ''Know Your Enemy: Japan '' for his U.S. War Department film series ''[[Why We Fight]]''. The film's commentary was written largely by [[Carl Foreman]].  Capra fired Ivens from the project because he felt that his approach was too sympathetic toward the Japanese. The film's release was held up because there were concerns that [[Emperor Hirohito]] was being depicted as a war criminal, and there was a policy shift to portray the Emperor more favorably after the war{{dubious|This probably only concerned the last episode? All were shot before Japan's surrender! Or is it misleading, and meant to say: the US took into consideration in advance what the post-war impact might be?|date=April 2020}} as a means of maintaining order in post-war Japan.\n\nWith the emerging \"Red Scare\" of the late 1940s, Ivens was forced to leave the country in the early months of the Truman administration. Ivens' leftist politics also put the kibosh on his first feature film project which was to have starred [[Greta Garbo]]. In fact, [[Walter Wanger]], the film's producer, was adamant about \"running [Ivens] out of town.\"\n\n== Return to Europe ==\n\nIn 1946, commissioned to make a Dutch film about Indonesian 'independence', Ivens resigned in protest over what he considered ongoing [[imperialism]]; the Dutch were in his view resisting decolonization. Instead, Ivens filmed ''[[Indonesia Calling]]'' in secret, for which he received funding from the [[International Workers Order]].<ref name=Musser>\n{{cite journal\n| first = Charles\n| last = Musser\n| authorlink = Charles Musser\n| title = Carl Marzani and Union Films: Making Left-Wing Documentaries during the Cold War, 1946\u201353\n| journal = The Moving Image\n| publisher = University of Minnesota Press\n| url = http://www.charlesmusser.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Musser-MarzaniandUnionFilms.pdf\n| pages = 104-160, 124 (Indonesia Calling)\n| date = 2009\n| accessdate = 26 January 2020}}</ref> For around a decade Ivens lived in Eastern Europe, working for several studios there. His position concerning Indonesia and his taking sides for the [[Eastern Bloc]] in the [[Cold War]] annoyed the Dutch government. Over a period of many years, he was obliged to renew his passport every three or four months. According to later mythology however, he lost his passport for ten years, which is not true, as demonstrated by the fact that he was able to travel to New York City to sit by the bedside of his old friend [[Paul Robeson]] when he was ill.\n\nFrom 1965 to 1970 he filmed two propaganda films about North Vietnam during the war: he made ''[[17e parall\u00e8le: La guerre du peuple]]'' ''(17th Parallel: Vietnam in War)'' and he participated in the collective work ''[[Loin du Vietnam]]'' (''Far from Vietnam''). He was awarded the [[Lenin Peace Prize]] for the year 1967.\n\nFrom 1971 to 1977, he shot ''[[How Yukong Moved the Mountains]]'', a 763-minute propaganda documentary about the [[Cultural Revolution]] in China. He was given unprecedented access because of his pro-communist views and his old personal friendships with [[Zhou Enlai]] and [[Mao Zedong]].\n\nHe spoke to [[Radio Netherlands]] about his life and work in a wide-ranging interview.<ref>[http://www.radionetherlandsarchives.org/vip-lounge-joris-ivens/ \"VIP Lounge - Joris Ivens\", Radio Netherlands Archives, June 7, 1989]</ref>\n\nIn 1988 Ivens received the [[Golden Lion|Golden Lion Honorary Award]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://ivens.nl/en/biographie|website=Joris Ivens Archive|accessdate=9 June 2017}}</ref>  He then received the [[Order of the Netherlands Lion]] in January 1989, and died on 28 June that year.  Shortly before his death he released the last of more than 40 films ''[[Une histoire de vent]]'' (''A Tale of the Wind'').

He had first caught the eye of Barons' manager [[Piper Davis]] in tenth grade, when Davis had Mays try out for the team. Davis encouraged Mays to work on hitting the [[curveball]], coached him periodically for a couple years, and gave Mays a chance to play for the Barons starting in 1947, when Mays was just 16.<ref>Mays, pp. 24, 26, 30</ref> When E.

Mays hit a respectable .262 for the season, but it was also his excellent fielding and baserunning that made him a standout.<ref>Hirsch, p. 38-48</ref>\n\nOver the next several years, a number of major league baseball franchises sent scouts to watch him play. The first was the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]]. The scout who discovered him, Bud Maughn, had been following him for over a year and referred him to the Braves, who then packaged a deal that called for $7,500 down and $7,500 in 30 days. They also planned to give Mays $6,000. The obstacle in the deal was that Tom Hayes, owner of the [[Birmingham Black Barons]], wanted to keep Mays for the balance of the season. Had the team been able to act more quickly, the Braves franchise might have had both Mays and [[Hank Aaron]] in their outfield from 1954 to 1973. The [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] also scouted him and wanted Ray Blades to negotiate a deal, but they were too late. The New York Giants had already signed Mays for $4,000 and assigned him to their Class-B affiliate in [[Trenton, New Jersey]].<ref>June 22, 1950 letter from Eddie Montague to Jack Schwarz</ref>\n\n===Minor leagues===\nAccording to Mays, Eddie Montague had been sent to Birmingham to scout [[Alonzo Perry]] as a potential first baseman for the [[Sioux City Soos]] of the Class-A [[Western League (1900\u20131958)|Western League]], but Montague became interested in Mays instead after watching a doubleheader.<ref>Mays, pp. 44-45</ref> Due to a scandal in Sioux City concerning a Native American's burial in a whites-only cemetery at the time, Sioux City decided not to take Mays, and he was assigned to the [[Trenton Giants]] of the [[Interstate League]] instead.<ref>Mays, pp. 45-46</ref>\n\nAfter Mays batted .353 in Trenton, he began the 1951 season with the class AAA [[Minneapolis Millers]] of the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]]. During his short time span in Minneapolis, Mays played with two other future Hall of Famers: [[Hoyt Wilhelm]] and [[Ray Dandridge]]. Batting .477 in 35 games and playing excellent defense, Mays was called up to the Giants on May 24, 1951. Mays was at a [[movie theater]] in [[Sioux City, Iowa]] when he found out he was being called up. A message flashed up on the screen that said:  \"WILLIE MAYS CALL YOUR HOTEL.\"<ref>''The Giants of the Polo Grounds'' by Noel Hynd (1988).

Although his .274 average, 68 RBI and 20 homers (in 121 games) were among the lowest of his career, he still won the 1951 [[MLB Rookie of the Year award|Rookie of the Year Award]].

In the middle of May, 1955, Durocher asked him to try for more home runs.<ref>Mays, pp. 128-29</ref> Mays led the league with 51. In 1956, he hit 36 homers and stole 40 bases, being only the second player, and first National League player, to join the \"[[30\u201330 club]]\". In 1957, the first season the [[Gold Glove]] award was presented, he won the first of 12 consecutive [[Gold Glove Award]]s. At the same time, Mays continued to finish in the National League's top-five in a variety of offensive categories. Mays, [[Roberto Clemente]] (also with 12), [[Al Kaline]], [[Andruw Jones]], [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]] and [[Ichiro Suzuki]] are the only outfielders to have ten or more career Gold Gloves.

He had first caught the eye of Barons' manager [[Piper Davis]] in tenth grade, when Davis had Mays try out for the team. Davis encouraged Mays to work on hitting the [[curveball]], coached him periodically for a couple years, and gave Mays a chance to play for the Barons starting in 1947, when Mays was just 16.<ref>Mays, pp. 24, 26, 30</ref> When E. T. Oliver, principal at Mays's high school, threatened to suspend Mays for playing professional ball, Davis and Mays's father convinced him that Mays would still be able to concentrate on his studies.<ref>Mays, p. 32</ref> Mays helped Birmingham win the pennant and advance to the 1948 [[Negro League World Series]], which they lost 4-1 to the [[Homestead Grays]]. Mays hit a respectable .262 for the season, but it was also his excellent fielding and baserunning that made him a standout.<ref>Hirsch, p. 38-48</ref>\n\nOver the next several years, a number of major league baseball franchises sent scouts to watch him play. The first was the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]]. The scout who discovered him, Bud Maughn, had been following him for over a year and referred him to the Braves, who then packaged a deal that called for $7,500 down and $7,500 in 30 days. They also planned to give Mays $6,000. The obstacle in the deal was that Tom Hayes, owner of the [[Birmingham Black Barons]], wanted to keep Mays for the balance of the season. Had the team been able to act more quickly, the Braves franchise might have had both Mays and [[Hank Aaron]] in their outfield from 1954 to 1973. The [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] also scouted him and wanted Ray Blades to negotiate a deal, but they were too late. The New York Giants had already signed Mays for $4,000 and assigned him to their Class-B affiliate in [[Trenton, New Jersey]].<ref>June 22, 1950 letter from Eddie Montague to Jack Schwarz</ref>\n\n===Minor leagues===\nAccording to Mays, Eddie Montague had been sent to Birmingham to scout [[Alonzo Perry]] as a potential first baseman for the [[Sioux City Soos]] of the Class-A [[Western League (1900\u20131958)|Western League]], but Montague became interested in Mays instead after watching a doubleheader.<ref>Mays, pp. 44-45</ref> Due to a scandal in Sioux City concerning a Native American's burial in a whites-only cemetery at the time, Sioux City decided not to take Mays, and he was assigned to the [[Trenton Giants]] of the [[Interstate League]] instead.<ref>Mays, pp. 45-46</ref>\n\nAfter Mays batted .353 in Trenton, he began the 1951 season with the class AAA [[Minneapolis Millers]] of the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]]. During his short time span in Minneapolis, Mays played with two other future Hall of Famers: [[Hoyt Wilhelm]] and [[Ray Dandridge]]. Batting .477 in 35 games and playing excellent defense, Mays was called up to the Giants on May 24, 1951. Mays was at a [[movie theater]] in [[Sioux City, Iowa]] when he found out he was being called up. A message flashed up on the screen that said:  \"WILLIE MAYS CALL YOUR HOTEL.\"<ref>''The Giants of the Polo Grounds'' by Noel Hynd (1988). New York: Doubleday. page 358. {{ISBN|0-385 23790-1}}</ref>{{efn|Mays's autobiography has the account slightly differently. He remembered the houselights coming on in the middle of a movie and someone mounting the stage to announce, \"If Willie Mays is in the audience, would he please report immediately to his manager at the hotel.\"<ref>Mays, p. 60</ref>}} He appeared in his first major league game the next day in [[Philadelphia]]. Mays moved to [[Harlem, New York]], where his mentor was a [[New York State Boxing Commission]] official and former Harlem Rens basketball legend  \"Strangler\" [[Frank Forbes]].\n\n===Major leagues===\n\n====New York Giants (1951\u20131957)====\nMays began his major league career on a sour note, with no hits in his first 12 [[at bat]]s. On his 13th at-bat, however, he hit a towering home run up and over the left field roof of the [[Polo Grounds]] off future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Famer]] [[Warren Spahn]].<ref>[http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016223.html ESPN.com: Mays brought joy to baseball<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Spahn later joked, \"I'll never forgive myself. We might have gotten rid of Willie forever if I'd only struck him out.\"  Mays' batting average improved steadily throughout the rest of the season. Although his .274 average, 68 RBI and 20 homers (in 121 games) were among the lowest of his career, he still won the 1951 [[MLB Rookie of the Year award|Rookie of the Year Award]].

In addition he won two 4 \u00d7 100 relay gold medals. He gained worldwide fame for his double sprint victory in world record times at the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Olympics]], which made him the first person to hold both records since [[fully automatic time]] became mandatory. \n\nAn eleven-time [[World Championships in Athletics|World Champion]], he won consecutive [[100 metres at the World Championships in Athletics|World Championship 100&nbsp;m]], [[200 metres at the World Championships in Athletics|200&nbsp;m]] and [[4 \u00d7 100 metres relay at the World Championships in Athletics|4 \u00d7 100 metres relay]] gold medals from 2009 to 2015, with the exception of a 100&nbsp;m [[false start]] in 2011.

A French army under the command of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was defeated by two of the armies of the [[Seventh Coalition]]: an army consisting of units from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Hanover, Brunswick and Nassau, under the command of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], referred to by many authors as the Anglo-allied army or Wellington's army, and a [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] army under the command of Field Marshal [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|von Bl\u00fccher]] referred also as Bl\u00fccher's army. The battle marked the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nUpon Napoleon's return to power in March 1815, many states that had opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition and began to mobilise armies. Wellington and Bl\u00fccher's armies were [[canton (military)|cantoned]] close to the northeastern border of France. Napoleon planned to attack them separately in the hope of destroying them before they could join in a coordinated invasion of France with other members of the coalition. On 16 June, Napoleon successfully attacked the bulk of the Prussian army at the [[Battle of Ligny]] with his main force, causing the Prussians to [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|withdraw northwards on the 17th]], parallel to Wellington and in good order. Napoleon sent a third of his forces to pursue the Prussians, which resulted in the separate [[Battle of Wavre]] with the Prussian rear-guard on 18\u201319 June, and prevented that French force from participating at Waterloo. Also on 16 June, a small portion of the French army contested the [[Battle of Quatre Bras]] with the Anglo-allied army. The Anglo-allied army held their ground on 16 June, but the withdrawal of the Prussians caused Wellington to [[Waterloo campaign: Quatre Bras to Waterloo|withdraw north to Waterloo on the 17th.]]\n \nUpon learning that the Prussian army was able to support him, Wellington decided to offer battle on the [[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Mont-Saint-Jean]] escarpment across the Brussels road, near the village of Waterloo. Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon of the 18th, aided by the progressively arriving Prussians who attacked the French flank and inflicted heavy casualties. In the evening Napoleon assaulted the Anglo-allied line with his last reserves, the senior infantry battalions of the [[French Imperial Guard]]. With the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank, the Anglo-allied army withstood and repulsed the [[French Imperial Guard]], and the French army was routed.\n\nWaterloo was the decisive engagement of the [[Waterloo Campaign]] and Napoleon's last. According to Wellington, the battle was \"the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life\".<ref>[[q:Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wikiquote:Wellington]] citing ''Creevey Papers'', ch. x, p. 236</ref> [[Abdication of Napoleon, 1815|Napoleon abdicated]] four days later, and coalition forces entered Paris on 7 July. The defeat at Waterloo ended Napoleon's rule as [[Emperor of the French]] and marked the end of his [[Hundred Days]] return from exile. This ended the [[First French Empire]] and set a chronological milestone between serial European wars and decades of [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)|relative peace]], often referred to as the ''[[Pax Britannica]]''.\n\nThe battlefield is located in the Belgian municipalities of [[Braine-l'Alleud]] and [[Lasne]],{{sfn|Marcelis|2015}} about {{convert|15|km|mi}} south of [[Brussels]], and about {{convert|2|km|mi}} from the town of Waterloo. The site of the battlefield today is dominated by the monument of the [[Lion's Mound]], a large artificial hill constructed from earth taken from the battlefield itself; the topography of the battlefield near the mound has not been preserved.\n\n==Prelude==\n{{Main|Waterloo Campaign}}\n[[File:Strategic Situation of Western Europe 1815.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|The strategic situation in Western Europe in 1815: 250,000 Frenchmen faced a coalition of about 850,000 soldiers on four [[Front (military)|fronts]].

Crucially, this would have bought him time to recruit and train more men before turning his armies against the Austrians and Russians.{{sfn|Siborne|1895| pp= 320\u2013323}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.waterloo-campaign.nl/bestanden/files/preambles/plannen.nap.pdf |title= The campaign of 1815: a study - A fundamental choice: a defensive or offensive war  |publisher= Waterloo Campaign NL | date= | author=  | accessdate= April 8, 2020  }}</ref>\n\nAn additional consideration for Napoleon was that a French victory might cause French-speaking sympathisers in Belgium to launch a friendly revolution. Also, coalition troops in Belgium were largely second-line, as many units were of dubious quality and loyalty, and most of the British veterans of the [[Peninsular War]] had been sent to North America to fight in the [[War of 1812]].{{sfn|Chandler|1966|pp=1016, 1017, 1093}}\n\nThe initial dispositions of British commander [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], were intended to counter the threat of Napoleon enveloping the Coalition armies by moving through [[Mons]] to the south-west of Brussels.{{sfn|Siborne<!--W-->|1895|p=82}} This would have pushed Wellington closer to the Prussian forces, led by [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher]], but might have cut Wellington's communications with his base at [[Ostend]]. In order to delay Wellington's deployment, Napoleon spread false intelligence which suggested that Wellington's supply chain from the channel ports would be cut.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=136\u2013160}}\n\nBy June, Napoleon had raised a total army strength of about 300,000 men. The force at his disposal at Waterloo was less than one third that size, but the rank and file were nearly all loyal and experienced soldiers.{{sfn|Herold|1967|pp= 53, 58, 110}} Napoleon divided his army into a left wing commanded by [[Michel Ney|Marshal Ney]], a right wing commanded by [[Emmanuel, marquis de Grouchy|Marshal Grouchy]] and a reserve under his command (although all three elements remained close enough to support one another). Crossing the frontier near [[Charleroi]] before dawn on 15 June, the French [[Waterloo Campaign: Start of hostilities (15 June)|rapidly overran Coalition outposts]], securing Napoleon's \"central position\" between Wellington's and Bl\u00fccher's armies. He hoped this would prevent them from combining, and he would be able to destroy first the Prussian's army, then Wellington's.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/battle-waterloo |title= Battle of Waterloo - Opening moves    |publisher= National Army Museum | date=  | author=   | accessdate= April 17, 2020  }}</ref><ref name=\"Simner\">{{cite book|author=Mark Simner|title=An Illustrated Introduction to the Battle of Waterloo - Quatre Bras and Ligny |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQAnCgAAQBAJ|date=15 May 2015|publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited|isbn=978-1-4456-4667-1}}</ref><ref name=\"Hussey2017\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/35009953/The_Road_to_Waterloo_a_concise_history_of_the_1815_campaign |title=  The Road to Waterloo: a concise history of the 1815 campaign | publisher=Academia | date=  | author=Alasdair White | accessdate= April 19, 2020  }}</ref>\n\nOnly very late on the night of 15 June was Wellington certain that the Charleroi attack was the main French thrust. In the early hours of 16 June, at the [[Duchess of Richmond's ball]] in Brussels, he received a dispatch from the [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]] and was shocked by the speed of Napoleon's advance. He hastily ordered his army to concentrate on [[Quatre Bras]], where the Prince of Orange, with the brigade of [[Bernhard Carl of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar]], was holding a tenuous position against the soldiers of Ney's left wing.{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=508}}\n\nNey's orders were to secure the crossroads of Quatre Bras, so that he could later swing east and reinforce Napoleon if necessary. Ney found the crossroads of [[Battle of Quatre Bras|Quatre Bras]] lightly held by the Prince of Orange, who repelled Ney's initial attacks but was gradually driven back by overwhelming numbers of French troops. First reinforcements, and then Wellington arrived. He took command and drove Ney back, securing the crossroads by early evening, too late to send help to the Prussians, who had already been defeated.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061125023608/http://waterloobattletours.users.btopenworld.com/page14.html |title= The Battle of Quatre Bras (June 16th 1815)    |publisher= Archive Org | date=  | author=   | accessdate= April 17, 2020  }}</ref><ref name=\"Simner\"/><ref name=\"Perr2013\">{{cite book|author=Bryan Perrett|title=Why the Germans Lost: The Rise and Fall of the Black Eagle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b8o7BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA51|date=20 November 2013|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=978-1-78159-197-0|pages=51\u2013}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 16 June, Napoleon attacked and defeated Bl\u00fccher's Prussians at the [[Battle of Ligny]] using part of the reserve and the right wing of his army. The Prussian centre gave way under heavy French assaults, but the flanks held their ground. [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|The Prussian retreat from Ligny]] went uninterrupted and seemingly unnoticed by the French. The bulk of their rearguard units held their positions until about midnight, and some elements did not move out until the following morning, ignored by the French.{{sfn|Chesney|1874|p=144}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/36063281/Beckes_Waterloo_Logistics |title= Becke's Waterloo Logistics    |publisher= Academia | date=  | author=Stephen Summerfield | accessdate= April 17, 2020  }}</ref>\n\nCrucially, the Prussians did not retreat to the east, along their own lines of communication. Instead, they, too, fell back northwards\u2014parallel to Wellington's line of march, still within supporting distance and in communication with him throughout. The Prussians rallied on [[Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von B\u00fclow|B\u00fclow]]'s IV Corps, which had not been engaged at Ligny and was in a strong position south of [[Wavre]].{{sfn|Chesney|1874|pp=144\u2013145}}\n\nWith the Prussian retreat from Ligny, Wellington's position at Quatre Bras was untenable.

With the exception of the British and some from Hanover and Brunswick who had fought with the British army in Spain, many of the professional soldiers in the Coalition armies had spent some of their time in the French army or in armies allied to the Napoleonic regime. The historian [[Alessandro Barbero]] states that in this heterogeneous army the difference between British and foreign troops did not prove significant under fire.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|p=19}}\n\nWellington was also acutely short of heavy cavalry, having only seven British and three Dutch regiments. The [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] imposed many of his staff officers on Wellington, including his second-in-command the [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Earl of Uxbridge]]. Uxbridge commanded the cavalry and had [[Blank cheque|carte blanche]] from Wellington to commit these forces at his discretion. Wellington stationed a further 17,000 troops at [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]], {{convert|8|mi|km}} away to the west. They were mostly composed of Dutch troops under the Prince of Orange's younger brother [[Prince Frederick of the Netherlands]]. They were placed as a guard against any possible wide flanking movement by the French forces, and also to act as a rearguard if Wellington was forced to retreat towards Antwerp and the coast.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=239\u2013240}}{{efn|The straight-line distance from Halle to Braine-l'Alleud, Wellington's far right flank is nearly the same as the straight-line distance from Wavre to [[Frichermont]], Wellington's far left flank, around {{convert|8|mi|km}}.}}\n\nThe Prussian army was in the throes of reorganisation. In 1815, the former Reserve regiments, Legions, and ''Freikorps'' volunteer formations from the wars of 1813\u20131814 were in the process of being absorbed into the line, along with many ''[[Landwehr]]'' (militia) regiments. The ''Landwehr'' were mostly untrained and unequipped when they arrived in Belgium. The Prussian cavalry were in a similar state.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|p=59}} Its artillery was also reorganising and did not give its best performance\u2014guns and equipment continued to arrive during and after the battle.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nOffsetting these handicaps, the Prussian Army had excellent and professional leadership in its [[German General Staff|General Staff]] organisation. These officers came from four schools developed for this purpose and thus worked to a common standard of training. This system was in marked contrast to the conflicting, vague orders issued by the French army. This staff system ensured that before Ligny, three-quarters of the Prussian army concentrated for battle with 24 hours' notice.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nAfter Ligny, the Prussian army, although defeated, was able to realign its supply train, reorganise itself, and intervene decisively on the Waterloo battlefield within 48 hours.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}} Two and a half Prussian army corps, or 48,000 men, were engaged at Waterloo; two brigades under B\u00fclow, commander of IV Corps, attacked [[Georges Mouton|Lobau]] at 16:30, while [[Hans Ernst Karl, Graf von Zieten|Zieten]]'s I Corps and parts of [[Pirch I]]'s II Corps engaged at about 18:00.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Prussian March |url=https://www.waterlooassociation.org.uk/2018/06/04/prussian-advance/ |website=Waterloo Association |accessdate=9 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Battlefield==\n{{further|List of Waterloo Battlefield locations}}\n[[File:Waterloo.1816.02.jpg|thumb|left|An 1816 map of the local topography and the location of the battle]]\n[[File:Belgium-6773 - Battlefield View (14152126362).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A view of the battlefield from the Lion's mound. On the top right are the buildings of [[La Haye Sainte]].]]\n\nThe Waterloo position was a strong one. It consisted of a long ridge running east\u2013west, perpendicular to, and bisected by, the main road to Brussels. Along the crest of the ridge ran the [[Ohain, Belgium|Ohain]] road, a deep [[sunken lane]]. Near the crossroads with the Brussels road was [[Waterloo Elm|a large elm tree]] that was roughly in the centre of Wellington's position and served as his command post for much of the day. Wellington deployed his infantry in a line just behind the crest of the ridge following the Ohain road.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78\u201379}}\n\nUsing the [[Reverse slope defence|reverse slope]], as he had many times previously, Wellington concealed his strength from the French, with the exception of his [[skirmisher]]s and artillery.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78\u201379}} The length of front of the battlefield was also relatively short at {{convert|2.5|mi|0}}. This allowed Wellington to draw up his forces in depth, which he did in the centre and on the right, all the way towards the village of [[Braine-l'Alleud]], in the expectation that the Prussians would reinforce his left during the day.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=80}}\n\nIn front of the ridge, there were three positions that could be fortified. On the extreme right were the ch\u00e2teau, garden, and orchard of [[Hougoumont (farmhouse)|Hougoumont]]. This was a large and well-built country house, initially hidden in trees. The house faced north along a sunken, covered lane (usually described by the British as \"the hollow-way\") along which it could be supplied. On the extreme left was the hamlet of [[Papelotte]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}}\n\nBoth Hougoumont and Papelotte were fortified and garrisoned, and thus anchored Wellington's [[Flanking maneuver|flanks]] securely. Papelotte also commanded the road to Wavre that the Prussians would use to send reinforcements to Wellington's position. On the western side of the main road, and in front of the rest of Wellington's line, was the farmhouse and orchard of [[La Haye Sainte]], which was garrisoned with 400 light infantry of the King's German Legion.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}} On the opposite side of the road was a disused sand quarry, where the [[95th Rifles]] were posted as sharpshooters.{{sfn|Parry|1900|p=58}}\n\nWellington's forces positioning presented a formidable challenge to any attacking force. Any attempt to turn Wellington's right would entail taking the entrenched Hougoumont position. Any attack on his right centre would mean the attackers would have to march between [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilading fire]] from Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte. On the left, any attack would also be enfiladed by fire from La Haye Sainte and its adjoining sandpit, and any attempt at turning the left flank would entail fighting through the lanes and hedgerows surrounding Papelotte and the [[List of Waterloo Battlefield locations#Eastern end of the line of battle|other garrisoned buildings]] on that flank, and some very wet ground in the Smohain [[defile (geography)|defile]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=141, 235}}\n\nThe French army formed on the slopes of another ridge to the south. Napoleon could not see Wellington's positions, so he drew his forces up symmetrically about the Brussels road. On the right was I Corps under [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon|d'Erlon]] with 16,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry, plus a cavalry reserve of 4,700. On the left was II Corps under [[Honor\u00e9 Charles Reille|Reille]] with 13,000 infantry, and 1,300 cavalry, and a cavalry reserve of 4,600. In the centre about the road south of the inn ''[[La Belle Alliance]]'' were a reserve including Lobau's VI Corps with 6,000 men, the 13,000 infantry of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]], and a cavalry reserve of 2,000.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=83\u201385}}\n\nIn the right rear of the French position was the substantial village of [[Plancenoit]], and at the extreme right, the ''Bois de Paris'' wood. Napoleon initially commanded the battle from Rossomme farm, where he could see the entire battlefield, but moved to a position near ''La Belle Alliance'' early in the afternoon. Command on the battlefield (which was largely hidden from his view) was delegated to Ney.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=91}}\n{{wide image|Panorama waterloo v2.jpg|1100px|align-cap=center|Panorama of the Waterloo battlefield, (2012)}}\n\n==Battle==\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Waterloo Campaign map-alt3.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Map of the Waterloo campaign]]\n\nWellington rose at around 02:00 or 03:00 on 18 June, and wrote letters until dawn. He had earlier written to Bl\u00fccher confirming that he would give battle at Mont-Saint-Jean if Bl\u00fccher could provide him with at least one corps; otherwise he would retreat towards Brussels. At a late-night council, Bl\u00fccher's chief of staff, [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau]], had been distrustful of Wellington's strategy, but Bl\u00fccher persuaded him that they should march to join Wellington's army. In the morning Wellington duly received a reply from Bl\u00fccher, promising to support him with three corps.{{sfn|Longford|1971|pp=535\u2013536}}\n\nFrom 06:00 Wellington was in the field supervising the deployment of his forces. At Wavre, the Prussian IV Corps under B\u00fclow was designated to lead the march to Waterloo as it was in the best shape, not having been involved in the Battle of Ligny. Although they had not taken casualties, IV Corps had been marching for two days, covering the retreat of the three other corps of the Prussian army from the battlefield of Ligny. They had been posted farthest away from the battlefield, and progress was very slow. The roads were in poor condition after the night's heavy rain, and B\u00fclow's men had to pass through the congested streets of Wavre and move 88&nbsp;artillery pieces. Matters were not helped when a fire broke out in Wavre, blocking several streets along B\u00fclow's intended route. As a result, the last part of the corps left at 10:00, six hours after the leading elements had moved out towards Waterloo. B\u00fclow's men were followed to Waterloo first by I Corps and then by II Corps.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=141}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\">{{cite book|author=John Grehan|title=Voices from the Past: Waterloo 1815: History's most famous battle told through eyewitness accounts, newspaper reports, parliamentary debate, memoirs and diaries.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0KuCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA342|date=30 May 2015|publisher=Frontline Books|isbn=978-1-78383-199-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref>\n\nNapoleon breakfasted off silver plate at ''Le Caillou'', the house where he had spent the night. When [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Soult]] suggested that Grouchy should be recalled to join the main force, Napoleon said, \"Just because you have all been beaten by Wellington, you think he's a good general.

He had acted similarly in the past, and on the morning of the battle of Waterloo may have been responding to the pessimism and objections of his chief of staff and senior generals.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|pp=163\u2013166}}\n\n[[File:Napoleon.Waterloo.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Battle of Mont-Saint-Jean]]]]\n\nLater on, being told by his brother, [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte|Jerome]], of some gossip overheard by a waiter between British officers at lunch at the 'King of Spain' inn in Genappe that the Prussians were to march over from Wavre, Napoleon declared that the Prussians would need at least two days to recover and would be dealt with by Grouchy.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=73}} Surprisingly, Jerome's overheard gossip aside, the French commanders present at the pre-battle conference at ''Le Caillou'' had no information about the alarming proximity of the Prussians and did not suspect that Bl\u00fccher's men would start erupting onto the field of battle in great numbers just five hours later.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=xxxii}}\n\nNapoleon had delayed the start of the battle owing to the sodden ground, which would have made manoeuvring cavalry and artillery difficult. In addition, many of his forces had [[bivouac shelter|bivouacked]] well to the south of ''La Belle Alliance''. At 10:00, in response to a dispatch he had received from Grouchy six hours earlier, he sent a reply telling Grouchy to \"head for Wavre [to Grouchy's north] in order to draw near to us [to the west of Grouchy]\" and then \"push before him\" the Prussians to arrive at Waterloo \"as soon as possible\".{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=548}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\"/>\n\nAt 11:00, Napoleon drafted his general order: Reille's Corps on the left and d'Erlon's Corps to the right were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep abreast of one another. This order assumed Wellington's battle-line was in the village, rather than at the more forward position on the ridge.{{sfn|Bonaparte|1869|pp=292\u2013293}} To enable this, Jerome's division would make an initial attack on Hougoumont, which Napoleon expected would draw in Wellington's reserves,{{sfn|Fletcher|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=US-QQxjHnn8C&pg=PA20 20]}} since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea. A ''[[Grand Battery|grande batterie]]'' of the reserve artillery of I, II, and VI Corps was to then bombard the centre of Wellington's position from about 13:00. D'Erlon's corps would then attack Wellington's left, break through, and roll up his line from east to west. In his memoirs, Napoleon wrote that his intention was to separate Wellington's army from the Prussians and drive it back towards the sea.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=95\u201398}}\n\n===Hougoumont===\n{{Main|Hougoumont}}\n[[File:Nassau - Hougoumont - Papendrecht.jpg|thumb|Nassau troops at the Hougoumont farm]]\n[[File:800px-North gate Hougoumont.jpg|thumb|Gate on the north side assaulted by the ''1st L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' who were led by ''[[sous-lieutenant]]'' Legros{{sfn|Lamar|2000|p=119}}]]\n\nThe historian Andrew Roberts notes that \"It is a curious fact about the Battle of Waterloo that no one is absolutely certain when it actually began\".{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=55}} Wellington recorded in his dispatches that at \"about ten o'clock [Napoleon] commenced a furious attack upon our post at Hougoumont\".{{sfn|Wellesley|1815|loc=''To Earl Bathurst.

The Duke of Wellington puts it at 10:00. General Alava says half-past eleven, Napoleon and Drouet say noon, and Ney 13:00. Lord Hill may be credited with having settled this minute question of fact. He took two watches with him into the fight, one a stop-watch, and he marked with it the sound of the first shot fired, and this evidence is now accepted as proving that the first flash of red flame which marked the opening of the world-shaking tragedy of Waterloo took place at exactly ten minutes to twelve\" {{Harv|Fitchett|2006|loc=Chapter: King-making Waterloo}}. \"...watches had to be set by solar time, this meant that it was rare for two watches to agree... For example, on 9 June, ... the French I Corps had been at Lille, while the IV Corps was at Metz. Assuming an officer had set his watch at noon and then meticulously wound it twice a day but not reset it during the approach march, by the time the two corps reached the vicinity of Waterloo, the I Corps officer's watch would have read 12:40 p.m. at a time when the IV Corps officer's read 11:20 a.m., and it was noon at Waterloo. This is an extreme example, and unlikely to have actually been the case, but it demonstrates the problem quite well\" {{harv|Nofi|1998|p=182}}.}} The house and its immediate environs were defended by four light companies of [[Foot guards|Guards]], and the wood and park by Hanoverian ''[[J\u00e4ger (military)|J\u00e4ger]]'' and the 1/2nd Nassau.{{efn|That is, the 1st battalion of the 2nd Regiment.

As the British guns were distracted by a duel with French artillery, a second attack by Soye's brigade and what had been Bauduin's succeeded in reaching the north gate of the house. Sous-Lieutenant Legros, a French officer, broke the gate open with an axe, and some French troops managed to enter the courtyard.{{sfn|Thiers|1862|p=215}} The [[Coldstream Guards]] and the [[Scots Guards]] arrived to support the defence. There was a fierce melee, and the British managed to close the gate on the French troops streaming in. The Frenchmen trapped in the courtyard were all killed. Only a young drummer boy was spared.\n\nFighting continued around Hougoumont all afternoon. Its surroundings were heavily invested by French light infantry, and coordinated attacks were made against the troops behind Hougoumont. Wellington's army defended the house and the hollow way running north from it. In the afternoon, Napoleon personally ordered the house to be shelled to set it on fire,{{efn|Seeing the flames, Wellington sent a note to the house's commander stating that he must hold his position whatever the cost {{Harv|Barbero|2005|p=298}}.}} resulting in the destruction of all but the chapel. Du Plat's brigade of the King's German Legion was brought forward to defend the hollow way, which they had to do without senior officers. Eventually they were relieved by the [[71st (Highland) Regiment of Foot|71st Highlanders]], a British infantry regiment. Adam's brigade was further reinforced by [[Hugh Halkett]]'s 3rd Hanoverian Brigade, and successfully repulsed further infantry and cavalry attacks sent by Reille.

The farmhouse was defended by the [[King's German Legion]]. While one French battalion engaged the defenders from the front, the following battalions fanned out to either side and, with the support of several squadrons of [[cuirassiers]], succeeded in isolating the farmhouse. The King's German Legion resolutely defended the farmhouse. Each time the French tried to scale the walls the outnumbered Germans somehow held them off. The [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]] saw that La Haye Sainte had been cut off and tried to reinforce it by sending forward the Hanoverian L\u00fcneburg Battalion in line. Cuirassiers concealed in a fold in the ground caught and destroyed it in minutes and then rode on past La Haye Sainte, almost to the crest of the ridge, where they covered d'Erlon's left flank as his attack developed.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=289\u2013293}}\n\nAt about 13:30, d'Erlon started to advance his three other divisions, some 14,000&nbsp;men over a front of about {{convert|1,000|m|yd|abbr=off}}, against Wellington's left wing. At the point they aimed for they faced 6,000&nbsp;men: the first line consisted of the Dutch 1st \"[[Brigade van Bylandt]]\" of the 2nd Dutch division, flanked by the British brigades of Kempt and Pack on either side. The second line consisted of British and Hanoverian troops under [[Sir Thomas Picton]], who were lying down in dead ground behind the ridge. All had suffered badly at Quatre Bras. In addition, the Bijlandt brigade had been ordered to deploy its skirmishers in the hollow road and on the forward slope. The rest of the brigade was lying down just behind the road.{{efn|Website of current Dutch historian<!--s: Erwin van Muilwijk: [http://home.tiscali.nl/erwinmuilwijk/index.htm Tiscali.nl], and... website no longer contains the referenced sources--> Marco Bijl: [http://www.8militia.net/ 8militia.net];{{Harvnb|Eenens|1879|pp=14\u201330, 131\u2013198}}; De Jongh, W.A.: Veldtocht van den Jare 1815, Historisch verhaal; in De Nieuwe Militaire Spectator (Nijmegen 1866), pp. 13\u201327.(This is the original account of Colonel de Jongh, commander of the Dutch 8th Militia.

It was lined on both sides by thick hedges, with [[Willem Frederik van Bylandt|Bylandt]]'s brigade just across the road while the British brigades had been lying down some 100 yards back from the road, Pack's to Bylandt's left and Kempt's to Bylandt's right. Kempt's 1,900 men were engaged by Bourgeois' brigade of 1,900 men of Quiot's division. In the centre, Donzelot's division had pushed back Bylandt's brigade. On the right of the French advance was Marcognet's division led by Grenier's brigade consisting of the ''45e R\u00e9giment de Ligne'' and followed by the ''25e R\u00e9giment de Ligne'', somewhat less than 2,000 men, and behind them, Nogue's brigade of the ''21e'' and ''45e'' regiments. Opposing them on the other side of the road was [[Denis Pack|Pack]]'s 9th Brigade consisting of the [[44th Foot]] and three Scottish regiments: the [[Royal Scots]], the 42nd [[Black Watch]], and the 92nd Gordons, totalling something over 2,000 men. A very even fight between British and French infantry was about to occur.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|pp=134\u2013138}}\n\nThe French advance drove in the British skirmishers and reached the sunken road. As they did so, Pack's men stood up, formed into a four deep line formation for fear of the French cavalry, advanced, and opened fire. However, a firefight had been anticipated and the French infantry had accordingly advanced in more linear formation. Now, fully deployed into line, they returned fire and successfully pressed the British troops; although the attack faltered at the centre, the line in front of d'Erlon's right started to crumble. Picton was killed shortly after ordering the counter-attack and the British and Hanoverian troops also began to give way under the pressure of numbers.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=296\u2013297}} Pack's regiments, all four ranks deep, advanced to attack the French in the road but faltered and began to fire on the French instead of charging. The 42nd Black Watch halted at the hedge and the resulting fire-fight drove back the British 92nd Foot while the leading French ''45e Ligne'' burst through the hedge cheering. Along the sunken road, the French were forcing the Anglo-allies back, the British line was dispersing, and at two o'clock in the afternoon Napoleon was winning the Battle of Waterloo.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|p=138}}\n\nReports from [[Karl Freiherr von M\u00fcffling|Baron von M\u00fcffling]], the Prussian liaison officer attached to Wellington's army, relate that: \"After 3 o'clock the Duke's situation became critical, unless the succour of the Prussian army arrived soon\".{{sfn|Uffindell|Corum|2002|p=211}}\n\n===Charge of the British heavy cavalry===\n{{quote|Our officers of cavalry have acquired a trick of galloping at everything.

He mistook the movement of casualties to the rear for the beginnings of a retreat, and sought to exploit it. Following the defeat of d'Erlon's Corps, Ney had few infantry reserves left, as most of the infantry had been committed either to the futile Hougoumont attack or to the defence of the French right.

Squares were much smaller than usually depicted in paintings of the battle\u2014a 500-man battalion square would have been no more than {{convert|60|ft}} in length on a side. Squares that stood their ground were deadly to cavalry, as cavalry could not engage with soldiers behind a hedge of bayonets, but were themselves vulnerable to fire from the squares. Horses would not charge a square, nor could they be outflanked, but they were vulnerable to artillery or infantry. Wellington ordered his artillery crews to take shelter within the squares as the cavalry approached, and to return to their guns and resume fire as they retreated.{{sfn|Siborne<!--W-->|1895|pp=444, 447}}{{sfn|Adkin|2001|pp=273, 414}}\n\nWitnesses in the British infantry recorded as many as 12&nbsp;assaults, though this probably includes successive waves of the same general attack; the number of general assaults was undoubtedly far fewer. Kellermann, recognising the futility of the attacks, tried to reserve the elite ''carabinier'' brigade from joining in, but eventually Ney spotted them and insisted on their involvement.{{sfn|Adkin|2001|p=359}}\n\nA British eyewitness of the first French cavalry attack, an officer in the Foot Guards, recorded his impressions very lucidly and somewhat poetically:\n\n{{quote|About four p.m., the enemy's artillery in front of us ceased firing all of a sudden, and we saw large masses of cavalry advance: not a man present who survived could have forgotten in after life the awful grandeur of that charge. You discovered at a distance what appeared to be an overwhelming, long moving line, which, ever advancing, glittered like a stormy wave of the sea when it catches the sunlight. On they came until they got near enough, whilst the very earth seemed to vibrate beneath the thundering tramp of the mounted host. One might suppose that nothing could have resisted the shock of this terrible moving mass. They were the famous cuirassiers, almost all old soldiers, who had distinguished themselves on most of the battlefields of Europe. In an almost incredibly short period they were within twenty yards of us, shouting ''\"Vive l'Empereur!\"'' The word of command, \"Prepare to receive cavalry\", had been given, every man in the front ranks knelt, and a wall bristling with steel, held together by steady hands, presented itself to the infuriated cuirassiers.|Captain Rees Howell Gronow, Foot Guards.{{sfn|Gronow|1862|loc=''The Duke of Wellington in our square''}} }}\n\n[[File:Artillery in Battle of Waterloo by Jones.jpg|thumb|\"The artillery officers had the range so accurately, that every shot and shell fell into the very centre of their masses\" (Original inscription and drawing after [[George Jones (painter)|George Jones]])]]\n\nIn essence this type of massed cavalry attack relied almost entirely on psychological shock for effect.{{sfn|Weller|1992|pp=211, 212}} Close artillery support could disrupt infantry squares and allow cavalry to penetrate; at Waterloo, however, co-operation between the French cavalry and artillery was not impressive. The French artillery did not get close enough to the Anglo-allied infantry in sufficient numbers to be decisive.{{sfn|Adkin|2001|pp=252, 361}} Artillery fire between charges did produce mounting casualties, but most of this fire was at relatively long range and was often indirect, at targets beyond the ridge. If infantry being attacked held firm in their square defensive formations, and were not panicked, cavalry on their own could do very little damage to them. The French cavalry attacks were repeatedly repelled by the steadfast infantry squares, the harrying fire of British artillery as the French cavalry recoiled down the slopes to regroup, and the decisive countercharges of Wellington's light cavalry regiments, the Dutch heavy cavalry brigade, and the remaining effectives of the Household Cavalry. At least one artillery officer disobeyed Wellington's order to seek shelter in the adjacent squares during the charges. [[Cavali\u00e9 Mercer|Captain Mercer]], who commanded [[G Parachute Battery (Mercer's Troop) Royal Horse Artillery|'G' Troop]], [[Royal Horse Artillery]], thought the Brunswick troops on either side of him so shaky that he kept his battery of six nine-pounders in action against the cavalry throughout, to great effect.{{sfn|Mercer|1870a|pp=313\u2013315}}{{efn|This qualification may have been self-serving on Mercer's part.

The Prince of Orange then ordered a single battalion of the KGL, the Fifth, to recapture the farm despite the obvious presence of enemy cavalry.

This attack, mounted at around 19:30, was intended to break through Wellington's centre and roll up his line away from the Prussians.

Two batteries of Imperial Guard Horse Artillery accompanied them with sections of two guns between the squares. Each square was led by a general and Marshal Ney, mounted on his 5th horse of the day, led the advance.{{sfn|Field|2013|pp=191\u2013192}} Behind them, in reserve, were the three battalions of the Old Guard, right to left 1st/2nd Grenadiers, 2nd/2nd Chasseurs and 1st/2nd Chasseurs. Napoleon left Ney to conduct the assault; however, Ney led the Middle Guard on an oblique towards the Anglo-allied centre right instead of attacking straight up the centre. Napoleon sent Ney's senior ADC Colonel Crabb\u00e9 to order Ney to adjust, but Crabb\u00e9 was unable to get there in time.\n\nOther troops rallied to support the advance of the Guard. On the left infantry from Reille's corps that was not engaged with Hougoumont and cavalry advanced. On the right all the now rallied elements of D'\u00c9rlon's corps once again ascended the ridge and engaged the Anglo-allied line. Of these, P\u00e9got's brigade broke into skirmish order and moved north and west of La Haye Sainte and provided fire support to Ney, once again unhorsed, and Friant's 1st/3rd Grenadiers. The Guards first received fire from some Brunswick battalions, but the return fire of the grenadiers forced them to retire. Next, Colin Halket's brigade front line consisting of the 30th Foot and 73rd traded fire but they were driven back in confusion into the 33rd and 69th regiments, Halket was shot in the face and seriously wounded and the whole brigade retreated in a mob. Other Anglo-allied troops began to give way as well. A counterattack by the Nassauers and the remains of Kielmansegge's brigade from the Anglo-allied second line, led by the Prince of Orange, was also thrown back and the Prince of Orange was seriously wounded. General Harlet brought up the 4th Grenadiers and the Anglo-allied centre was now in serious danger of breaking.\n\n[[File:General D H Chass\u00e9.jpg|thumb|upright|General D H Chass\u00e9|General [[David Hendrik Chass\u00e9]]]]\n\nIt was at this critical moment that the Dutch General [[David Hendrik Chass\u00e9|Chass\u00e9]] engaged the advancing French forces.{{sfn|Field|2013|pp=196\u2013199}} Chass\u00e9's relatively fresh Dutch division was sent against them, led by a battery of Dutch horse-artillery commanded by Captain [[Carel Frederik Krahmer de Bichin|Krahmer de Bichin]].

Suddenly 1,500 British Foot Guards under [[Peregrine Maitland|Maitland]] who had been lying down to protect themselves from the French artillery rose and devastated them with point-blank volleys.

At the crest the chasseurs came upon the battery that had caused severe casualties on the 1st and 2nd/3rd Chasseurs. They opened fire and swept away the gunners. The left flank of their square now came under fire from a heavy formation of British skirmishers, which the chasseurs drove back. But the skirmishers were replaced by the [[52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot|52nd Light Infantry]], led by [[John Colborne]], which wheeled in line onto the chasseurs' flank and poured a devastating fire into them. The chasseurs returned a very sharp fire which killed or wounded some 150 men of the 52nd.{{sfn|Field|2013|pp=203}} The 52nd then charged,{{sfn|Chesney|1874|pp=214\u2013215}}{{sfn|Parry|1900|p=70}} and under this onslaught, the chasseurs broke.{{sfn|Parry|1900|p=70}}\n\nThe last of the Guard retreated headlong.

Changes to the configuration of European states, as refashioned after Waterloo, included the formation of the [[Holy Alliance]] of reactionary governments intent on repressing revolutionary and democratic ideas, and the reshaping of the former [[Holy Roman Empire]] into a [[German Confederation]] increasingly marked by the political dominance of [[Prussia]]. The bicentenary of Waterloo prompted renewed attention to the geopolitical and economic legacy of the battle and to the century of relative transatlantic peace which followed.<ref>{{harvnb|Rapport|2015}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Black|2015}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Keeling|2015}}</ref>{{efn|Napoleon's last escapade was important politically because it \"compelled all the powers at Vienna to bury their remaining differences in order to achieve a peace which would enshrine the principles of the balance of power\".{{Harv|Kennedy|1987|p= 37}} \"No international disturbance comparable in magnitude...has ever been followed by such a protracted period of peace\". {{Harv|Palmer|1956|p=420}} Recovering, after Waterloo, from six decades of abnormal obstacles to transatlantic commerce (from the Seven Years War onwards), increasingly industrialized Europe and North America, by 1914, accounted for over 90% of global coal, iron and steel production and 76% of international trade.{{Harv|Paxton|1985|p= 2}} }}\n\n===Views on the reasons for Napoleon's defeat===\nGeneral [[Antoine-Henri Jomini|Antoine-Henri]], Baron Jomini, one of the leading military writers on the Napoleonic art of war, had a number of very cogent explanations of the reasons behind Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo.{{efn|Jomini was Swiss, but was an officer, eventually a general, in the French army and had served on the staff of Marshal Ney. He later served in the Russian Army.}}\n\n{{quote|\nIn my opinion, four principal causes led to this disaster:\n\nThe first, and most influential, was the arrival, skilfully combined, of Bl\u00fccher, and the false movement that favoured this arrival;{{efn|This \"false movement\" was the detachment of Grouchy's force in pursuit of the Prussians: Napoleon had overestimated the extent of his victory at Ligny and underestimated the resilience of the Prussians. He also seems to have discounted the presence of B\u00fclow's substantial corps, which had not been in action at Ligny. Had Napoleon retained Grouchy's 30,000 men as a guard for his right flank, it is likely that these troops could have held off the Prussians and allowed the rest of Napoleon's army to attack Wellington's army unmolested.}} the second, was the admirable firmness of the British infantry, joined to the sang-froid and aplomb of its chiefs; the third, was the horrible weather, that had softened the ground, and rendered the offensive movements so toilsome, and retarded till one o'clock the attack that should have been made in the morning; the fourth, was the inconceivable formation of the first corps, in masses very much too deep for the first grand attack.|Antoine-Henri Jomini.{{sfn|Jomini|1864|pp=223, 224}} }}\n\nThe Prussian soldier, historian, and theorist [[Carl von Clausewitz]], who as a young colonel had served as chief-of-staff to Thielmann's Prussian III Corps during the Waterloo campaign, expressed the following opinion:\n\n{{quote|\nBonaparte and the authors who support him have always attempted to portray the great catastrophes that befell him as the result of chance. They seek to make their readers believe that through his great wisdom and extraordinary energy the whole project had already moved forward with the greatest confidence, that complete success was but a hair's breadth away, when treachery, accident, or even fate, as they sometimes call it, ruined everything. He and his supporters do not want to admit that huge mistakes, sheer recklessness, and, above all, overreaching ambition that exceeded all realistic possibilities, were the true causes.|Carl von Clausewitz.{{sfn|Clausewitz|Feldzug von 1815 (''Campaign of 1815'')|loc=''[http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/1815/five1-9.htm#Ch3 Chapter 3]''}} }}\n\nWellington himself wrote in his official dispatch back to London:\n\n{{quote|I should not do justice to my own feelings, or to Marshal Bl\u00fccher and the Prussian army, if I did not attribute the successful result of this arduous day to the cordial and timely assistance I received from them. The operation of General B\u00fclow upon the enemy's flank was a most decisive one; and, even if I had not found myself in a situation to make the attack which produced the final result, it would have forced the enemy to retire if his attacks should have failed, and would have prevented him from taking advantage of them if they should unfortunately have succeeded\".<ref name=\"Gazette, 17028\"/>}}\nDespite their differences on other matters, discussed at length in Carl von Clausewitz's study of the ''Campaign of 1815'' and ''Wellington's famous 1842 essay'' in reply to it, the Prussian Clausewitz agreed with Wellington on this assessment.{{sfn|Clausewitz|Wellington|2010|loc=''[http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/1815/five1-9.htm Campaign of 1815]'' and ''[http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/1815/six.htm Wellington's famous 1842 essay]''}} Indeed, Clausewitz viewed the battle prior to the Prussian intervention more as a mutually exhausting stalemate than as an impending French victory, with the advantage, if any, leaning towards Wellington.{{sfn|Clausewitz|Wellington|2010|pp=144\u2013145 (Chapter 41 of Clausewitz's ''Feldzug'')}}\n\nAn alternative view is that towards the end of the battle Wellington's Anglo-allied army faced imminent defeat without Prussian help. For example, Parkinson (2000) writes: \"Neither army beat Napoleon alone. But whatever the part played by Prussian troops in the actual moment when the Imperial Guard was repulsed, it is difficult to see how Wellington could have staved off defeat, when his centre had been almost shattered, his reserves were almost all committed, the French right remained unmolested and the Imperial Guard intact. .... Bl\u00fccher may not have been totally responsible for victory over Napoleon, but he deserved full credit for preventing a British defeat\".{{sfn|Parkinson|2000|pp=240\u2013241}} Steele (2014) writes: \"Bl\u00fccher's arrival not only diverted vital reinforcements, but also forced Napoleon to accelerate his effort against Wellington.

Tourism began the day after the battle, with Captain Mercer noting that on 19 June \"a carriage drove on the ground from Brussels, the inmates of which, alighting, proceeded to examine the field\".{{sfn|Mercer|1870a|p=345}} In 1820, the Netherlands' King [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]] ordered the construction of a monument.

It has been disfigured for the sake of glorifying it. Wellington, when he beheld Waterloo once more, two years later, exclaimed, \"They have altered my field of battle!\" Where the great pyramid of earth, surmounted by the lion, rises to-day, there was a hillock which descended in an easy slope towards the Nivelles road, but which was almost an escarpment on the side of the highway to Genappe. The elevation of this escarpment can still be measured by the height of the two knolls of the two great sepulchres which enclose the road from Genappe to Brussels: one, the English tomb, is on the left; the other, the German tomb, is on the right.

These include the rolling farmland to the east of the Brussels\u2013Charleroi Road as well as the buildings at Hougoumont, La Haye Sainte, and La Belle Alliance.\n\nApart from the Lion Mound, there are several more conventional but noteworthy monuments throughout the battlefield. A cluster of monuments at the Brussels\u2013Charleroi and Braine L'Alleud\u2013Ohain crossroads marks the mass graves of British, Dutch, Hanoverian and King's German Legion troops.

A French army under the command of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was defeated by two of the armies of the [[Seventh Coalition]]: an army consisting of units from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Hanover, Brunswick and Nassau, under the command of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], referred to by many authors as the Anglo-allied army or Wellington's army, and a [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] army under the command of Field Marshal [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|von Bl\u00fccher]] referred also as Bl\u00fccher's army. The battle marked the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nUpon Napoleon's return to power in March 1815, many states that had opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition and began to mobilise armies. Wellington and Bl\u00fccher's armies were [[canton (military)|cantoned]] close to the northeastern border of France. Napoleon planned to attack them separately in the hope of destroying them before they could join in a coordinated invasion of France with other members of the coalition. On 16 June, Napoleon successfully attacked the bulk of the Prussian army at the [[Battle of Ligny]] with his main force, causing the Prussians to [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|withdraw northwards on the 17th]], parallel to Wellington and in good order. Napoleon sent a third of his forces to pursue the Prussians, which resulted in the separate [[Battle of Wavre]] with the Prussian rear-guard on 18\u201319 June, and prevented that French force from participating at Waterloo. Also on 16 June, a small portion of the French army contested the [[Battle of Quatre Bras]] with the Anglo-allied army. The Anglo-allied army held their ground on 16 June, but the withdrawal of the Prussians caused Wellington to [[Waterloo campaign: Quatre Bras to Waterloo|withdraw north to Waterloo on the 17th.]]\n \nUpon learning that the Prussian army was able to support him, Wellington decided to offer battle on the [[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Mont-Saint-Jean]] escarpment across the Brussels road, near the village of Waterloo. Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon of the 18th, aided by the progressively arriving Prussians who attacked the French flank and inflicted heavy casualties. In the evening Napoleon assaulted the Anglo-allied line with his last reserves, the senior infantry battalions of the [[French Imperial Guard]]. With the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank, the Anglo-allied army withstood and repulsed the [[French Imperial Guard]], and the French army was routed.\n\nWaterloo was the decisive engagement of the [[Waterloo Campaign]] and Napoleon's last. According to Wellington, the battle was \"the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life\".<ref>[[q:Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wikiquote:Wellington]] citing ''Creevey Papers'', ch. x, p. 236</ref> [[Abdication of Napoleon, 1815|Napoleon abdicated]] four days later, and coalition forces entered Paris on 7 July. The defeat at Waterloo ended Napoleon's rule as [[Emperor of the French]] and marked the end of his [[Hundred Days]] return from exile. This ended the [[First French Empire]] and set a chronological milestone between serial European wars and decades of [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)|relative peace]], often referred to as the ''[[Pax Britannica]]''.\n\nThe battlefield is located in the Belgian municipalities of [[Braine-l'Alleud]] and [[Lasne]],{{sfn|Marcelis|2015}} about {{convert|15|km|mi}} south of [[Brussels]], and about {{convert|2|km|mi}} from the town of Waterloo.

Also, coalition troops in Belgium were largely second-line, as many units were of dubious quality and loyalty, and most of the British veterans of the [[Peninsular War]] had been sent to North America to fight in the [[War of 1812]].{{sfn|Chandler|1966|pp=1016, 1017, 1093}}\n\nThe initial dispositions of British commander [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], were intended to counter the threat of Napoleon enveloping the Coalition armies by moving through [[Mons]] to the south-west of Brussels.{{sfn|Siborne<!--W-->|1895|p=82}} This would have pushed Wellington closer to the Prussian forces, led by [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher]], but might have cut Wellington's communications with his base at [[Ostend]].

The force at his disposal at Waterloo was less than one third that size, but the rank and file were nearly all loyal and experienced soldiers.{{sfn|Herold|1967|pp= 53, 58, 110}} Napoleon divided his army into a left wing commanded by [[Michel Ney|Marshal Ney]], a right wing commanded by [[Emmanuel, marquis de Grouchy|Marshal Grouchy]] and a reserve under his command (although all three elements remained close enough to support one another).

In the early hours of 16 June, at the [[Duchess of Richmond's ball]] in Brussels, he received a dispatch from the [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]] and was shocked by the speed of Napoleon's advance. He hastily ordered his army to concentrate on [[Quatre Bras]], where the Prince of Orange, with the brigade of [[Bernhard Carl of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar]], was holding a tenuous position against the soldiers of Ney's left wing.{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=508}}\n\nNey's orders were to secure the crossroads of Quatre Bras, so that he could later swing east and reinforce Napoleon if necessary. Ney found the crossroads of [[Battle of Quatre Bras|Quatre Bras]] lightly held by the Prince of Orange, who repelled Ney's initial attacks but was gradually driven back by overwhelming numbers of French troops. First reinforcements, and then Wellington arrived. He took command and drove Ney back, securing the crossroads by early evening, too late to send help to the Prussians, who had already been defeated.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061125023608/http://waterloobattletours.users.btopenworld.com/page14.html |title= The Battle of Quatre Bras (June 16th 1815)    |publisher= Archive Org | date=  | author=   | accessdate= April 17, 2020  }}</ref><ref name=\"Simner\"/><ref name=\"Perr2013\">{{cite book|author=Bryan Perrett|title=Why the Germans Lost: The Rise and Fall of the Black Eagle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b8o7BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA51|date=20 November 2013|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=978-1-78159-197-0|pages=51\u2013}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 16 June, Napoleon attacked and defeated Bl\u00fccher's Prussians at the [[Battle of Ligny]] using part of the reserve and the right wing of his army. The Prussian centre gave way under heavy French assaults, but the flanks held their ground. [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|The Prussian retreat from Ligny]] went uninterrupted and seemingly unnoticed by the French.

Instead, they, too, fell back northwards\u2014parallel to Wellington's line of march, still within supporting distance and in communication with him throughout. The Prussians rallied on [[Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von B\u00fclow|B\u00fclow]]'s IV Corps, which had not been engaged at Ligny and was in a strong position south of [[Wavre]].{{sfn|Chesney|1874|pp=144\u2013145}}\n\nWith the Prussian retreat from Ligny, Wellington's position at Quatre Bras was untenable.

The [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] imposed many of his staff officers on Wellington, including his second-in-command the [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Earl of Uxbridge]]. Uxbridge commanded the cavalry and had [[Blank cheque|carte blanche]] from Wellington to commit these forces at his discretion. Wellington stationed a further 17,000 troops at [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]], {{convert|8|mi|km}} away to the west. They were mostly composed of Dutch troops under the Prince of Orange's younger brother [[Prince Frederick of the Netherlands]]. They were placed as a guard against any possible wide flanking movement by the French forces, and also to act as a rearguard if Wellington was forced to retreat towards Antwerp and the coast.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=239\u2013240}}{{efn|The straight-line distance from Halle to Braine-l'Alleud, Wellington's far right flank is nearly the same as the straight-line distance from Wavre to [[Frichermont]], Wellington's far left flank, around {{convert|8|mi|km}}.}}\n\nThe Prussian army was in the throes of reorganisation. In 1815, the former Reserve regiments, Legions, and ''Freikorps'' volunteer formations from the wars of 1813\u20131814 were in the process of being absorbed into the line, along with many ''[[Landwehr]]'' (militia) regiments. The ''Landwehr'' were mostly untrained and unequipped when they arrived in Belgium. The Prussian cavalry were in a similar state.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|p=59}} Its artillery was also reorganising and did not give its best performance\u2014guns and equipment continued to arrive during and after the battle.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nOffsetting these handicaps, the Prussian Army had excellent and professional leadership in its [[German General Staff|General Staff]] organisation. These officers came from four schools developed for this purpose and thus worked to a common standard of training. This system was in marked contrast to the conflicting, vague orders issued by the French army. This staff system ensured that before Ligny, three-quarters of the Prussian army concentrated for battle with 24 hours' notice.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nAfter Ligny, the Prussian army, although defeated, was able to realign its supply train, reorganise itself, and intervene decisively on the Waterloo battlefield within 48 hours.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}} Two and a half Prussian army corps, or 48,000 men, were engaged at Waterloo; two brigades under B\u00fclow, commander of IV Corps, attacked [[Georges Mouton|Lobau]] at 16:30, while [[Hans Ernst Karl, Graf von Zieten|Zieten]]'s I Corps and parts of [[Pirch I]]'s II Corps engaged at about 18:00.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Prussian March |url=https://www.waterlooassociation.org.uk/2018/06/04/prussian-advance/ |website=Waterloo Association |accessdate=9 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Battlefield==\n{{further|List of Waterloo Battlefield locations}}\n[[File:Waterloo.1816.02.jpg|thumb|left|An 1816 map of the local topography and the location of the battle]]\n[[File:Belgium-6773 - Battlefield View (14152126362).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A view of the battlefield from the Lion's mound. On the top right are the buildings of [[La Haye Sainte]].]]\n\nThe Waterloo position was a strong one. It consisted of a long ridge running east\u2013west, perpendicular to, and bisected by, the main road to Brussels. Along the crest of the ridge ran the [[Ohain, Belgium|Ohain]] road, a deep [[sunken lane]]. Near the crossroads with the Brussels road was [[Waterloo Elm|a large elm tree]] that was roughly in the centre of Wellington's position and served as his command post for much of the day. Wellington deployed his infantry in a line just behind the crest of the ridge following the Ohain road.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78\u201379}}\n\nUsing the [[Reverse slope defence|reverse slope]], as he had many times previously, Wellington concealed his strength from the French, with the exception of his [[skirmisher]]s and artillery.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78\u201379}} The length of front of the battlefield was also relatively short at {{convert|2.5|mi|0}}. This allowed Wellington to draw up his forces in depth, which he did in the centre and on the right, all the way towards the village of [[Braine-l'Alleud]], in the expectation that the Prussians would reinforce his left during the day.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=80}}\n\nIn front of the ridge, there were three positions that could be fortified. On the extreme right were the ch\u00e2teau, garden, and orchard of [[Hougoumont (farmhouse)|Hougoumont]]. This was a large and well-built country house, initially hidden in trees. The house faced north along a sunken, covered lane (usually described by the British as \"the hollow-way\") along which it could be supplied. On the extreme left was the hamlet of [[Papelotte]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}}\n\nBoth Hougoumont and Papelotte were fortified and garrisoned, and thus anchored Wellington's [[Flanking maneuver|flanks]] securely. Papelotte also commanded the road to Wavre that the Prussians would use to send reinforcements to Wellington's position. On the western side of the main road, and in front of the rest of Wellington's line, was the farmhouse and orchard of [[La Haye Sainte]], which was garrisoned with 400 light infantry of the King's German Legion.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}} On the opposite side of the road was a disused sand quarry, where the [[95th Rifles]] were posted as sharpshooters.{{sfn|Parry|1900|p=58}}\n\nWellington's forces positioning presented a formidable challenge to any attacking force. Any attempt to turn Wellington's right would entail taking the entrenched Hougoumont position. Any attack on his right centre would mean the attackers would have to march between [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilading fire]] from Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte. On the left, any attack would also be enfiladed by fire from La Haye Sainte and its adjoining sandpit, and any attempt at turning the left flank would entail fighting through the lanes and hedgerows surrounding Papelotte and the [[List of Waterloo Battlefield locations#Eastern end of the line of battle|other garrisoned buildings]] on that flank, and some very wet ground in the Smohain [[defile (geography)|defile]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=141, 235}}\n\nThe French army formed on the slopes of another ridge to the south. Napoleon could not see Wellington's positions, so he drew his forces up symmetrically about the Brussels road. On the right was I Corps under [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon|d'Erlon]] with 16,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry, plus a cavalry reserve of 4,700. On the left was II Corps under [[Honor\u00e9 Charles Reille|Reille]] with 13,000 infantry, and 1,300 cavalry, and a cavalry reserve of 4,600. In the centre about the road south of the inn ''[[La Belle Alliance]]'' were a reserve including Lobau's VI Corps with 6,000 men, the 13,000 infantry of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]], and a cavalry reserve of 2,000.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=83\u201385}}\n\nIn the right rear of the French position was the substantial village of [[Plancenoit]], and at the extreme right, the ''Bois de Paris'' wood. Napoleon initially commanded the battle from Rossomme farm, where he could see the entire battlefield, but moved to a position near ''La Belle Alliance'' early in the afternoon. Command on the battlefield (which was largely hidden from his view) was delegated to Ney.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=91}}\n{{wide image|Panorama waterloo v2.jpg|1100px|align-cap=center|Panorama of the Waterloo battlefield, (2012)}}\n\n==Battle==\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Waterloo Campaign map-alt3.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Map of the Waterloo campaign]]\n\nWellington rose at around 02:00 or 03:00 on 18 June, and wrote letters until dawn. He had earlier written to Bl\u00fccher confirming that he would give battle at Mont-Saint-Jean if Bl\u00fccher could provide him with at least one corps; otherwise he would retreat towards Brussels. At a late-night council, Bl\u00fccher's chief of staff, [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau]], had been distrustful of Wellington's strategy, but Bl\u00fccher persuaded him that they should march to join Wellington's army. In the morning Wellington duly received a reply from Bl\u00fccher, promising to support him with three corps.{{sfn|Longford|1971|pp=535\u2013536}}\n\nFrom 06:00 Wellington was in the field supervising the deployment of his forces. At Wavre, the Prussian IV Corps under B\u00fclow was designated to lead the march to Waterloo as it was in the best shape, not having been involved in the Battle of Ligny. Although they had not taken casualties, IV Corps had been marching for two days, covering the retreat of the three other corps of the Prussian army from the battlefield of Ligny. They had been posted farthest away from the battlefield, and progress was very slow. The roads were in poor condition after the night's heavy rain, and B\u00fclow's men had to pass through the congested streets of Wavre and move 88&nbsp;artillery pieces. Matters were not helped when a fire broke out in Wavre, blocking several streets along B\u00fclow's intended route. As a result, the last part of the corps left at 10:00, six hours after the leading elements had moved out towards Waterloo. B\u00fclow's men were followed to Waterloo first by I Corps and then by II Corps.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=141}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\">{{cite book|author=John Grehan|title=Voices from the Past: Waterloo 1815: History's most famous battle told through eyewitness accounts, newspaper reports, parliamentary debate, memoirs and diaries.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0KuCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA342|date=30 May 2015|publisher=Frontline Books|isbn=978-1-78383-199-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref>\n\nNapoleon breakfasted off silver plate at ''Le Caillou'', the house where he had spent the night. When [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Soult]] suggested that Grouchy should be recalled to join the main force, Napoleon said, \"Just because you have all been beaten by Wellington, you think he's a good general. I tell you Wellington is a bad general, the English are bad troops, and this affair is nothing more than eating breakfast\".{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=547}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\"/>\n\nNapoleon's seemingly dismissive remark may have been strategic, given his maxim \"in war, morale is everything\". He had acted similarly in the past, and on the morning of the battle of Waterloo may have been responding to the pessimism and objections of his chief of staff and senior generals.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|pp=163\u2013166}}\n\n[[File:Napoleon.Waterloo.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Battle of Mont-Saint-Jean]]]]\n\nLater on, being told by his brother, [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte|Jerome]], of some gossip overheard by a waiter between British officers at lunch at the 'King of Spain' inn in Genappe that the Prussians were to march over from Wavre, Napoleon declared that the Prussians would need at least two days to recover and would be dealt with by Grouchy.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=73}} Surprisingly, Jerome's overheard gossip aside, the French commanders present at the pre-battle conference at ''Le Caillou'' had no information about the alarming proximity of the Prussians and did not suspect that Bl\u00fccher's men would start erupting onto the field of battle in great numbers just five hours later.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=xxxii}}\n\nNapoleon had delayed the start of the battle owing to the sodden ground, which would have made manoeuvring cavalry and artillery difficult. In addition, many of his forces had [[bivouac shelter|bivouacked]] well to the south of ''La Belle Alliance''. At 10:00, in response to a dispatch he had received from Grouchy six hours earlier, he sent a reply telling Grouchy to \"head for Wavre [to Grouchy's north] in order to draw near to us [to the west of Grouchy]\" and then \"push before him\" the Prussians to arrive at Waterloo \"as soon as possible\".{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=548}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\"/>\n\nAt 11:00, Napoleon drafted his general order: Reille's Corps on the left and d'Erlon's Corps to the right were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep abreast of one another. This order assumed Wellington's battle-line was in the village, rather than at the more forward position on the ridge.{{sfn|Bonaparte|1869|pp=292\u2013293}} To enable this, Jerome's division would make an initial attack on Hougoumont, which Napoleon expected would draw in Wellington's reserves,{{sfn|Fletcher|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=US-QQxjHnn8C&pg=PA20 20]}} since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea. A ''[[Grand Battery|grande batterie]]'' of the reserve artillery of I, II, and VI Corps was to then bombard the centre of Wellington's position from about 13:00. D'Erlon's corps would then attack Wellington's left, break through, and roll up his line from east to west. In his memoirs, Napoleon wrote that his intention was to separate Wellington's army from the Prussians and drive it back towards the sea.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=95\u201398}}\n\n===Hougoumont===\n{{Main|Hougoumont}}\n[[File:Nassau - Hougoumont - Papendrecht.jpg|thumb|Nassau troops at the Hougoumont farm]]\n[[File:800px-North gate Hougoumont.jpg|thumb|Gate on the north side assaulted by the ''1st L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' who were led by ''[[sous-lieutenant]]'' Legros{{sfn|Lamar|2000|p=119}}]]\n\nThe historian Andrew Roberts notes that \"It is a curious fact about the Battle of Waterloo that no one is absolutely certain when it actually began\".{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=55}} Wellington recorded in his dispatches that at \"about ten o'clock [Napoleon] commenced a furious attack upon our post at Hougoumont\".{{sfn|Wellesley|1815|loc=''To Earl Bathurst.

The Duke of Wellington puts it at 10:00. General Alava says half-past eleven, Napoleon and Drouet say noon, and Ney 13:00. Lord Hill may be credited with having settled this minute question of fact. He took two watches with him into the fight, one a stop-watch, and he marked with it the sound of the first shot fired, and this evidence is now accepted as proving that the first flash of red flame which marked the opening of the world-shaking tragedy of Waterloo took place at exactly ten minutes to twelve\" {{Harv|Fitchett|2006|loc=Chapter: King-making Waterloo}}. \"...watches had to be set by solar time, this meant that it was rare for two watches to agree... For example, on 9 June, ... the French I Corps had been at Lille, while the IV Corps was at Metz. Assuming an officer had set his watch at noon and then meticulously wound it twice a day but not reset it during the approach march, by the time the two corps reached the vicinity of Waterloo, the I Corps officer's watch would have read 12:40 p.m. at a time when the IV Corps officer's read 11:20 a.m., and it was noon at Waterloo. This is an extreme example, and unlikely to have actually been the case, but it demonstrates the problem quite well\" {{harv|Nofi|1998|p=182}}.}} The house and its immediate environs were defended by four light companies of [[Foot guards|Guards]], and the wood and park by Hanoverian ''[[J\u00e4ger (military)|J\u00e4ger]]'' and the 1/2nd Nassau.{{efn|That is, the 1st battalion of the 2nd Regiment.

As the British guns were distracted by a duel with French artillery, a second attack by Soye's brigade and what had been Bauduin's succeeded in reaching the north gate of the house. Sous-Lieutenant Legros, a French officer, broke the gate open with an axe, and some French troops managed to enter the courtyard.{{sfn|Thiers|1862|p=215}} The [[Coldstream Guards]] and the [[Scots Guards]] arrived to support the defence. There was a fierce melee, and the British managed to close the gate on the French troops streaming in. The Frenchmen trapped in the courtyard were all killed. Only a young drummer boy was spared.\n\nFighting continued around Hougoumont all afternoon. Its surroundings were heavily invested by French light infantry, and coordinated attacks were made against the troops behind Hougoumont. Wellington's army defended the house and the hollow way running north from it. In the afternoon, Napoleon personally ordered the house to be shelled to set it on fire,{{efn|Seeing the flames, Wellington sent a note to the house's commander stating that he must hold his position whatever the cost {{Harv|Barbero|2005|p=298}}.}} resulting in the destruction of all but the chapel. Du Plat's brigade of the King's German Legion was brought forward to defend the hollow way, which they had to do without senior officers. Eventually they were relieved by the [[71st (Highland) Regiment of Foot|71st Highlanders]], a British infantry regiment. Adam's brigade was further reinforced by [[Hugh Halkett]]'s 3rd Hanoverian Brigade, and successfully repulsed further infantry and cavalry attacks sent by Reille. Hougoumont held out until the end of the battle.\n\n{{quote|I had occupied that post with a detachment from General Byng's brigade of Guards, which was in position in its rear; and it was some time under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel MacDonald, and afterwards of Colonel Home; and I am happy to add that it was maintained, throughout the day, with the utmost gallantry by these brave troops, notwithstanding the repeated efforts of large bodies of the enemy to obtain possession of it.|Wellington.{{sfn|Booth|1815|p=10}} }}\n\n{{quote|When I reached Lloyd's abandoned guns, I stood near them for about a minute to contemplate the scene: it was grand beyond description.

Similarly, though the house never contained a large number of troops, Wellington devoted 21&nbsp;battalions (12,000&nbsp;troops) over the course of the afternoon in keeping the hollow way open to allow fresh troops and ammunition to reach the buildings. He moved several artillery batteries from his hard-pressed centre to support Hougoumont,{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=305, 306}} and later stated that \"the success of the battle turned upon closing the gates at Hougoumont\".{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=57}}\n\n===The Grand Battery starts its bombardment===\n[[File:Battle of Waterloo.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Map of the battle: Napoleon's units are in blue, Wellington's in red, Bl\u00fccher's in grey.]]\n\nThe 80 guns of Napoleon's ''grande batterie'' drew up in the centre.

The King's German Legion resolutely defended the farmhouse. Each time the French tried to scale the walls the outnumbered Germans somehow held them off. The [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]] saw that La Haye Sainte had been cut off and tried to reinforce it by sending forward the Hanoverian L\u00fcneburg Battalion in line. Cuirassiers concealed in a fold in the ground caught and destroyed it in minutes and then rode on past La Haye Sainte, almost to the crest of the ridge, where they covered d'Erlon's left flank as his attack developed.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=289\u2013293}}\n\nAt about 13:30, d'Erlon started to advance his three other divisions, some 14,000&nbsp;men over a front of about {{convert|1,000|m|yd|abbr=off}}, against Wellington's left wing. At the point they aimed for they faced 6,000&nbsp;men: the first line consisted of the Dutch 1st \"[[Brigade van Bylandt]]\" of the 2nd Dutch division, flanked by the British brigades of Kempt and Pack on either side. The second line consisted of British and Hanoverian troops under [[Sir Thomas Picton]], who were lying down in dead ground behind the ridge. All had suffered badly at Quatre Bras. In addition, the Bijlandt brigade had been ordered to deploy its skirmishers in the hollow road and on the forward slope.

The total of casualties for the whole brigade for the day was around 800 killed and wounded {{Harv|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=310\u2013311}}.}} D'Erlon's troops pushed through this gap in the line and the remaining battalions in the Bylandt brigade (8th Dutch Militia and Belgian 7th Line Battalion) were forced to retreat to the square of the 5th Dutch Militia, which was in reserve between Picton's troops, about 100 paces to the rear.

Van Zuylen rallied 400 men, according to his estimate, who were ready to join the counterattack and even captured two French fanions ({{Harvnb|Bas|Wommersom|1909|pp=338\u2013341}}(vol. 3); {{Harvnb|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=293\u2013295}}).}} A moment later the Prince of Orange ordered a counterattack, which actually occurred around 10 minutes later.

It was lined on both sides by thick hedges, with [[Willem Frederik van Bylandt|Bylandt]]'s brigade just across the road while the British brigades had been lying down some 100 yards back from the road, Pack's to Bylandt's left and Kempt's to Bylandt's right. Kempt's 1,900 men were engaged by Bourgeois' brigade of 1,900 men of Quiot's division. In the centre, Donzelot's division had pushed back Bylandt's brigade. On the right of the French advance was Marcognet's division led by Grenier's brigade consisting of the ''45e R\u00e9giment de Ligne'' and followed by the ''25e R\u00e9giment de Ligne'', somewhat less than 2,000 men, and behind them, Nogue's brigade of the ''21e'' and ''45e'' regiments. Opposing them on the other side of the road was [[Denis Pack|Pack]]'s 9th Brigade consisting of the [[44th Foot]] and three Scottish regiments: the [[Royal Scots]], the 42nd [[Black Watch]], and the 92nd Gordons, totalling something over 2,000 men. A very even fight between British and French infantry was about to occur.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|pp=134\u2013138}}\n\nThe French advance drove in the British skirmishers and reached the sunken road. As they did so, Pack's men stood up, formed into a four deep line formation for fear of the French cavalry, advanced, and opened fire. However, a firefight had been anticipated and the French infantry had accordingly advanced in more linear formation. Now, fully deployed into line, they returned fire and successfully pressed the British troops; although the attack faltered at the centre, the line in front of d'Erlon's right started to crumble. Picton was killed shortly after ordering the counter-attack and the British and Hanoverian troops also began to give way under the pressure of numbers.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=296\u2013297}} Pack's regiments, all four ranks deep, advanced to attack the French in the road but faltered and began to fire on the French instead of charging. The 42nd Black Watch halted at the hedge and the resulting fire-fight drove back the British 92nd Foot while the leading French ''45e Ligne'' burst through the hedge cheering. Along the sunken road, the French were forcing the Anglo-allies back, the British line was dispersing, and at two o'clock in the afternoon Napoleon was winning the Battle of Waterloo.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|p=138}}\n\nReports from [[Karl Freiherr von M\u00fcffling|Baron von M\u00fcffling]], the Prussian liaison officer attached to Wellington's army, relate that: \"After 3 o'clock the Duke's situation became critical, unless the succour of the Prussian army arrived soon\".{{sfn|Uffindell|Corum|2002|p=211}}\n\n===Charge of the British heavy cavalry===\n{{quote|Our officers of cavalry have acquired a trick of galloping at everything.

In an almost incredibly short period they were within twenty yards of us, shouting ''\"Vive l'Empereur!\"'' The word of command, \"Prepare to receive cavalry\", had been given, every man in the front ranks knelt, and a wall bristling with steel, held together by steady hands, presented itself to the infuriated cuirassiers.|Captain Rees Howell Gronow, Foot Guards.{{sfn|Gronow|1862|loc=''The Duke of Wellington in our square''}} }}\n\n[[File:Artillery in Battle of Waterloo by Jones.jpg|thumb|\"The artillery officers had the range so accurately, that every shot and shell fell into the very centre of their masses\" (Original inscription and drawing after [[George Jones (painter)|George Jones]])]]\n\nIn essence this type of massed cavalry attack relied almost entirely on psychological shock for effect.{{sfn|Weller|1992|pp=211, 212}} Close artillery support could disrupt infantry squares and allow cavalry to penetrate; at Waterloo, however, co-operation between the French cavalry and artillery was not impressive. The French artillery did not get close enough to the Anglo-allied infantry in sufficient numbers to be decisive.{{sfn|Adkin|2001|pp=252, 361}} Artillery fire between charges did produce mounting casualties, but most of this fire was at relatively long range and was often indirect, at targets beyond the ridge. If infantry being attacked held firm in their square defensive formations, and were not panicked, cavalry on their own could do very little damage to them. The French cavalry attacks were repeatedly repelled by the steadfast infantry squares, the harrying fire of British artillery as the French cavalry recoiled down the slopes to regroup, and the decisive countercharges of Wellington's light cavalry regiments, the Dutch heavy cavalry brigade, and the remaining effectives of the Household Cavalry. At least one artillery officer disobeyed Wellington's order to seek shelter in the adjacent squares during the charges. [[Cavali\u00e9 Mercer|Captain Mercer]], who commanded [[G Parachute Battery (Mercer's Troop) Royal Horse Artillery|'G' Troop]], [[Royal Horse Artillery]], thought the Brunswick troops on either side of him so shaky that he kept his battery of six nine-pounders in action against the cavalry throughout, to great effect.{{sfn|Mercer|1870a|pp=313\u2013315}}{{efn|This qualification may have been self-serving on Mercer's part.

The whole of that plain is a sepulchre for France.|[[Victor Hugo]], ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables]]''.{{sfn|Hugo|1862|loc=Chapter VII: Napoleon in a Good Humor}} }}\n\nThe alleged remark by Wellington about the alteration of the battlefield as described by Hugo was never documented, however.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/10218931/Rescuing-the-farm-where-Wellington-won-the-battle-of-Waterloo.html|title=Rescuing the farm where Wellington won the battle of Waterloo|last=Shute|first=Joe|date=2013-08-02|access-date=2018-01-17|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\nOther terrain features and notable landmarks on the field have remained virtually unchanged since the battle. These include the rolling farmland to the east of the Brussels\u2013Charleroi Road as well as the buildings at Hougoumont, La Haye Sainte, and La Belle Alliance.\n\nApart from the Lion Mound, there are several more conventional but noteworthy monuments throughout the battlefield. A cluster of monuments at the Brussels\u2013Charleroi and Braine L'Alleud\u2013Ohain crossroads marks the mass graves of British, Dutch, Hanoverian and King's German Legion troops. A monument to the French dead, entitled ''L'Aigle bless\u00e9'' (\"The Wounded Eagle\"), marks the location where it is believed one of the Imperial Guard units formed a square during the closing moments of the battle.{{sfn|Hoorebeeke|2007|pp=6\u201321}}\n\nA monument to the Prussian dead is located in the village of Plancenoit on the site where one of their artillery batteries took position. The [[Guillaume Philibert Duhesme|Duhesme]] mausoleum is one among the few graves of the fallen. It is located at the side of Saint Martin's Church in Ways, a hamlet in the municipality of [[Genappe]]. Seventeen fallen officers are buried in the crypt of the [[Brussels Cemetery#The British Waterloo Campaign Monument|British Monument]] in the [[Brussels Cemetery]] in [[Evere]].{{sfn|Hoorebeeke|2007|pp=6\u201321}} The remains of a 23-year-old soldier named Friederich Brandt were discovered in 2012.{{sfn|Paton|2015}} He was a slightly hunchbacked infantryman, {{convert|1.60|m}} tall, and was hit in the chest by a French bullet. His rifle, coins, and position on the battlefield identified him as an Hanoverian fighting in the King's German Legion.{{sfn|Peel|2012}}\n\n==Coin controversy==\nAs part of the bicentennial celebration of the battle, in 2015 [[Belgium]] minted a two-[[euro]] coin depicting the Lion monument over a map of the field of battle. France officially protested against this issue of coins, while the Belgian government noted that the French mint sells souvenir medals at Waterloo.{{sfn|Torfs|2015}} After 180,000 coins were minted but not released, the issue was melted. Instead, Belgium issued an identical commemorative coin in the non-standard value of 2{{sfrac|1|2}} euros. Legally valid only within the issuing country (but unlikely to circulate) it was minted in brass, packaged, and sold by the Belgian mint for 6 euros. A ten-euro coin, showing Wellington, Bl\u00fccher, their troops and the silhouette of Napoleon, was also available in silver for 42 euros.{{sfn|Kottasova|2015}}\n\n==Recent discovery at Mont St. Jean==\nOn 15 July 2019, archaeologists at [[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium]], found evidence of a shooting clash that happened there between attacking French cavalry and defending British infantry, including 58 [[musket ball]]s and 3 amputated human leg bones.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.itv.com/news/2019-07-17/human-remains-and-cannon-ball-unearthed-at-battle-of-waterloo-hospital-site/ |title=Human remains and cannon ball unearthed at Battle of Waterloo hospital site |date=17 July 2019 |access-date=20 September 2019 |work=[[ITV News]] |publisher=[[ITV plc]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/07/17/veterans-unearth-amputated-leg-bones-musket-balls-waterloo-field/ |title=Soldier archaeologists unearth musket balls and amputated leg bones at Battle of Waterloo field hospital site |first=James |last=Crisp |date=17 July 2019 |access-date=20 September 2019 |newspaper=[[Telegraph (newspaper)|Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group Limited]] |page=16}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|France|War}}\n* [[Lord Uxbridge's leg]] was shattered by a [[grape-shot]] at the Battle of Waterloo and removed by a surgeon.

In most countries, \"Shrekster\" is a high honor and only bestowed upon the best of shreksters. In some, the use of the rank \"shrekster\" is legally reserved for yo mama.\n\nPolice officers are generally charged with the apprehension of [[criminal]]s and the prevention and detection of [[crime]], protection and assistance of the general public, and the maintenance of public order. Police officers may be sworn to an [[Police oath|oath]], and have the power to [[arrest]] people and [[police custody|detain them]] for a limited time, along with other duties and powers. Some officers are trained in special duties, such as [[counter-terrorism]], [[surveillance]], [[child protection]], [[Very Important Person|VIP]] [[Protective security units|protection]], [[Civil law (common law)|civil law enforcement]], and investigation techniques into major crime including [[fraud]], [[rape]], [[murder]], and [[drug trafficking]]. Although many police officers wear a corresponding uniform, some police officers are plain-clothed in order to pass themselves off as civilians. In most countries police officers are given exemptions from certain laws to perform their duties. For example an officer may use force if necessary to arrest or detain a person when it would ordinarily be assault. In some countries, officers can also break road rules to perform their duties.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dulaney, W.

The more general term for the function is [[law enforcement officer]] or peace officer. A [[sheriff]] is typically the top police officer of a county, with that word coming from the person enforcing law over a [[shire]]. A person who has been deputized to serve the function of the sheriff is referred to as the deputy.\n\nPolice officers are those empowered by government to enforce the laws it creates. In ''[[The Federalist]]'' collection of articles and essays, [[James Madison]] wrote: \"[[:s:The Federalist (Dawson)/50|If men were angels, no Government would be necessary]]\". These words apply to those who serve government, including police. {{anchor|cop}}A common nickname for a police officer is \"cop\"; derived from the verb sense \"to arrest\", itself derived from \"to grab\". Thus, \"someone who captures\", a \"copper\", was shortened to just \"cop\".<ref>{{cite book|last = Dalzell|first = T.|date = 2007|title = Concise New Partridge Dictionary of Slang|titlelink = A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|location = New York|publisher = [[Routledge]]|page = 162|isbn = 9780415212595}}</ref> It may also find its origin in the Latin {{lang|la|capere}}, brought to English via the [[Old French]] {{lang|fr|caper}}.<ref>{{cite book|last = Partridge|first = E.|authorlink = Eric Partridge|date = 1972|title = A Dictionary of Historical Slang|titlelink = A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|location = London|publisher = [[Penguin Books|Penguin]]|isbn = 9780140510461|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/lenglish00eric}}</ref>\n\n==Duties and functions==\nResponsibilities of a police officer are varied, and may differ greatly from within one political context to another. Typical duties relate to keeping the peace, law enforcement, protection of people and property and the investigation of crimes. Officers are expected to respond to a variety of situations that may arise while they are on duty. Rules and guidelines dictate how an officer should behave within the community, and in many contexts, restrictions are placed on what the uniformed officer wears. In some countries, [[rule making|rules and procedures]] dictate that a police officer is obliged to intervene in a criminal incident, even if they are off-duty. Police officers in nearly all countries retain their lawful powers while off duty.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://education-portal.com/articles/Police_Officer_Educational_Requirements_for_Police_Officers.html |title=Educational Requirements for Police Officers |work=education-portal.com |year=2011 |accessdate=June 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the majority of [[Western world|Western]] legal systems, the major role of the police is to maintain order, keeping the peace through surveillance of the public, and the subsequent reporting and apprehension of suspected violators of the law. They also function to [[Deterrence (psychology)|discourage]] crimes through high-visibility policing, and most police forces have an investigative capability. Police have the legal authority to arrest and detain, usually granted by magistrates. Police officers also respond to emergency calls, along with routine [[community policing]].\n\nPolice are often used as an [[emergency service]] and may provide a public safety function at large gatherings, as well as in emergencies, [[Emergency preparedness|disasters]], [[search and rescue]] situations, and [[Car accident|road traffic collisions]]. To provide a prompt response in emergencies, the police often coordinate their operations with [[firefighting|fire]] and [[emergency medical service]]s. In some countries, individuals serve jointly as police officers as well as firefighters (creating the role of [[fire police]]). In many countries, there is a common [[emergency service number]] that allows the police, firefighters, or medical services to be summoned to an emergency. Some countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]] have outlined command procedures, for the use in major emergencies or disorder. The [[Gold Silver Bronze command structure]] is a system set up to improve communications between ground-based officers and the control room, typically, Bronze Commander would be a senior officer on the ground, coordinating the efforts in the center of the emergency, Silver Commanders would be positioned in an 'Incident Control Room' erected to improve better communications at the scene, and a Gold Commander who would be in the Control Room.\n\nPolice are also responsible for reprimanding minor offenders by issuing [[summons|citations]] which typically may result in the imposition of [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], particularly for violations of [[traffic]] law. Traffic enforcement is often and effectively accomplished by police officers on [[motorcycle]]s\u2014called ''motor officers,'' these officers refer to the motorcycles they ride on duty as simply ''motors.'' Police are also trained to assist persons in distress, such as motorists whose car has broken down and people experiencing a medical emergency. Police are typically trained in basic [[first aid]] such as [[CPR]].\n\nSome [[park ranger]]s are commissioned as law enforcement officers and carry out a law-enforcement role within [[national park]]s and other back-country wilderness and recreational areas, whereas [[Military police]] perform law enforcement functions within the military.\n\n==Entry and promotion qualifications==\nIn most countries, candidates for the police force must have completed some formal education.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://study.com/requirements_to_become_a_police_officer.html|title=Requirements to Become a Police Officer|publisher=}}</ref> Increasing numbers of people are joining the police force who possess [[tertiary education]] <ref>{{cite web|url=https://learn.org/articles/What_is_Tertiary_Education.html|title=What Is Tertiary Education?|publisher=}}</ref> and in response to this many police forces have developed a \"fast-track\" scheme whereby those with [[university degree]]s spend two to three years as a [[Constable]] before receiving promotion to higher ranks, such as [[Sergeant]]s or [[Inspector]]s. (Officers who work within investigative divisions or plainclothes are not necessarily of a higher rank but merely have different duties.){{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Police officers are also recruited from those with experience in the military or security services. In the United States [[U.S. state|state]] laws may [[Codification (law)|codify]] statewide qualification standards regarding age, education, criminal record, and training but in other places requirements are set by local police agencies. Each local Police agency has different requirements. \n[[File:Pol mun agenti.jpg|thumb|Officers of the [[Municipal police (Italy)|Polizia Municipale]] from [[Piacenza]], [[Italy]]]]\nPromotion is not automatic and usually requires the candidate to pass some kind of examination, interview board or other selection procedure. Although promotion normally includes an increase in [[salary]], it also brings with it an increase in responsibility and for most, an increase in administrative paperwork. There is no stigma attached to this, as experienced line patrol officers are highly regarded.\n\nDependent upon each agency, but generally after completing two years of service, officers may apply for specialist positions, such as [[detective]], [[police dog]] handler, [[mounted police]] officer, [[motorcycle]] officer, [[water police]] officer, or [[firearms officer]] (in countries where police are not routinely armed).\n\nIn some countries, including [[Singapore]], police ranks are supplemented through [[conscription]], similar to [[national service]] in the military. Qualifications may thus be relaxed or enhanced depending on the target mix of conscripts. Conscripts face tougher physical requirements in areas such as eyesight, but minimum academic qualification requirements are less stringent. Some join as volunteers, again via differing qualification requirements.\n\n==Pay==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2010}}\nIn some societies, police officers are paid relatively well compared to other occupations; their pay depends on what rank they are within their police force and how many years they have served.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.police-information.co.uk/policepay.htm |title=Police Pay |publisher=Police-information.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-02-06}}</ref>\nIn the United States, an average police officer's salary is between $53,561 and $64,581 in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.policeteststudyguide.com/police-officer-salaries-in-the-us/ |title=Police Pay |publisher=Police Test Study Guide |date= |accessdate=2020-04-12}}</ref> In the United Kingdom for the year 2015\u201316 a police officer's average salary was \u00a330,901.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n== Occupational safety and health ==\n{{main article|Police officer safety and health}}There are numerous issues affecting the [[Occupational safety and health|safety and health]] of police officers, including line of duty deaths and [[occupational stress]].

In most countries, \"police officer\" is a generic term not specifying a particular rank. In some, the use of the rank \"officer\" is legally reserved for military personnel.\n\nPolice officers are generally charged with the apprehension of [[criminal]]s and the prevention and detection of [[crime]], protection and assistance of the general public, and the maintenance of public order. Police officers may be sworn to an [[Police oath|oath]], and have the power to [[arrest]] people and [[police custody|detain them]] for a limited time, along with other duties and powers. Some officers are trained in special duties, such as [[counter-terrorism]], [[surveillance]], [[child protection]], [[Very Important Person|VIP]] [[Protective security units|protection]], [[Civil law (common law)|civil law enforcement]], and investigation techniques into major crime including [[fraud]], [[rape]], [[murder]], and [[drug trafficking]]. Although many police officers wear a corresponding uniform, some police officers are plain-clothed in order to pass themselves off as civilians. In most countries police officers are given exemptions from certain laws to perform their duties. For example an officer may use force if necessary to arrest or detain a person when it would ordinarily be assault. In some countries, officers can also break road rules to perform their duties.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dulaney, W.

The more general term for the function is [[law enforcement officer]] or peace officer. A [[sheriff]] is typically the top police officer of a county, with that word coming from the person enforcing law over a [[shire]]. A person who has been deputized to serve the function of the sheriff is referred to as the deputy.\n\nPolice officers are those empowered by government to enforce the laws it creates. In ''[[The Federalist]]'' collection of articles and essays, [[James Madison]] wrote: \"[[:s:The Federalist (Dawson)/50|If men were angels, no Government would be necessary]]\". These words apply to those who serve government, including police. {{anchor|cop}}A common nickname for a police officer is \"cop\"; derived from the verb sense \"to arrest\", itself derived from \"to grab\". Thus, \"someone who captures\", a \"copper\", was shortened to just \"cop\".<ref>{{cite book|last = Dalzell|first = T.|date = 2007|title = Concise New Partridge Dictionary of Slang|titlelink = A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|location = New York|publisher = [[Routledge]]|page = 162|isbn = 9780415212595}}</ref> It may also find its origin in the Latin {{lang|la|capere}}, brought to English via the [[Old French]] {{lang|fr|caper}}.<ref>{{cite book|last = Partridge|first = E.|authorlink = Eric Partridge|date = 1972|title = A Dictionary of Historical Slang|titlelink = A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|location = London|publisher = [[Penguin Books|Penguin]]|isbn = 9780140510461|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/lenglish00eric}}</ref>\n\n==Duties and functions==\nResponsibilities of a police officer are varied, and may differ greatly from within one political context to another.
