First settlements in this region are dated back to the epoch of mesolite (9\u20135th centuries B.C.). Later on the area was inhabited by the [[Dregovichi]] tribe. The town was first mentioned in the Novgorod chronicle in 1213 as a town of the [[Chernihiv]] Principality. Rechytsa was also ruled by [[Kiev]] and [[Turov, Belarus|Turov]] Grand Dukes. At the time of Gediminas reign (1311\u20131341) the town was annexed to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Re\u010dyca as well as Orsha, Shklow, Mogilev, Stary Bychaw and [[Rahachow]] formed a well-developed frontier defense system at the River Dniepr.\n\n[[File:Rzeczyca (BY) kosciol.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Holy Trinity Catholic church]]\n1392\u20131430 \u2013 the reign of Grand Duke Vytautas. He constructed a fortified castle with five towers in the area of the detinets (old Belarusian for the downtown) on the bank of the Dniepr. At that time the town had three fortification lines in the form of water trenches and ramparts with bastions. In the area between the fortress and the second fortification line there was a territory for rich mansions, Church of the Order of Friars Preachers and a trade square. The town inhabitants settled lived between the second and third fortification lines. The construction of the town had clear right-angled forms.\n\nIn 1561 the town was partially granted the [[Magdeburg rights]].\n\nIn the middle of the 17th century Rechytsa was practically destroyed during the Cossack war of 1648\u20131651. After the Truce of Anrusovo the town became a part of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1793 Rechytsa joined Russia and became an used center of the Minsk province.\n\nThe first permanent town plan of Rechytsa was approved in 1800. During the Napoleon Wars in 1812 the town was a temporary residence of the Minsk governor. Rechytsa (Retschschutz) was occupied by Napoleon's Immense Armee in some of 1812, fought over by Whites and Reds, 1917\u20131922, occupied by Central Powers Forces C. 1917-1918 and by Hitler's Axis, 1941-1943/4.\n\n===Jewish community===\nRechytsa had one of the oldest Jewish communities in Belarus, and later the town was a center for [[Chabad]] [[Hasidic]] Jews.

For other information about the professional [[soccer]] club based in [[Utah]], please see the [[Real Salt Lake|main article]].\n\n==2004==\n\n[[Image:Dave Checketts, cropped.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dave Checketts]], the founder of Real Salt Lake]]\nOn July 14, [[Major League Soccer]] officially awarded its 12th franchise to the state of [[Utah]] and ownership group SCP Worldwide, headed by [[Dave Checketts]].  Steve Pastorino was named general manager of the new team, and [[John Ellinger]] was hired as head coach.  The team was officially named \"Real Salt Lake\" in October of that year in honor to [[Real Madrid]].  The announcement was met with some discontent<ref>http://www.deseretnews.com/cgi-bin/cqcgi_plus/@plus.env?CQ_SESSION_KEY=RTNYEDTWUYCG&CQ_CUR_DOCUMENT=30&CQ_TEXT_MAIN=YES{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> among local soccer fans (see main article), but overall, the community remained excited about the new team.\n\nOn November 17, RSL acquired the first player in club history, trading with [[Dallas Burn]] for star forward [[Jason Kreis]].  Over the following months, the team added several players, including decorated MLS veterans [[Clint Mathis]] and [[Eddie Pope]].  Also, the team made arrangements to play home matches at [[Rice-Eccles Stadium]] on the campus of the [[University of Utah]], with hopes of eventually building a soccer-specific stadium in the [[Salt Lake City metropolitan area|Salt Lake area]] to host matches in the future.\n\n==2005==\n\nThe team played its first official match on April 2, slogging through a windy, rain-soaked<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/03/sports/soccer/03stars.html | work=The New York Times | first=Ron | last=Dicker | title=On a Night Unfit for Scoring, the MetroStars Slog to a Tie | date=April 3, 2005}}</ref> contest against [[New York Red Bulls|New York MetroStars]] at [[Giants Stadium]] in New Jersey.  That match ended as a scoreless draw.  The following week, Jason Kreis scored the first goal in franchise history in a 3\u20131 loss to [[LA Galaxy]] at the [[Home Depot Center]].  RSL returned to Utah to play its first-ever home match on April 16.  With 25,287 fans present at Rice-Eccles Stadium, [[Brian Dunseth]] scored a header in the 81st minute to deliver a 1\u20130 victory over the rival [[Colorado Rapids]].<ref>http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700264165/Real-Salt-Lake-Things-have-changed-a-lot-since-05-opener.html</ref>\n\nThe RSL faithful were thrilled, but from that point on, the season was mostly frustration and disappointment.  The team did log back-to-back victories in May, but high hopes were quickly dashed as RSL's offense sputtered.  The team set a league record by posting a 557-minute scoreless streak (later broken by [[Toronto FC]]).  Real recovered enough to log back-to-back wins later in the year, but again met with disaster: the team lost 10 consecutive matches before managing a 2\u20132 draw on the road against the [[San Jose Earthquakes]].  The season ended with a 1\u20130 loss at home against Colorado, giving RSL an overall record of 5-22-5 in the franchise's inaugural season.\n\nDespite the disappointing season, there were a few highlights.  In June, Salt Lake hosted a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] qualifier match between [[United States men's national soccer team|Team USA]] and [[Costa Rica]], drawing a boisterous crowd of 40,586 fans for the double-header at Rice-Eccles Stadium.<ref>http://www.mlssoccer.com/content/landon-donovan-kasey-keller-power-united-states-3-0-world-cup-qualifier-victory-over-costa-r</ref>  In August, Kreis notched his 100th career goal, becoming the first player in MLS history to reach that milestone.\n\n==2006==\n\nReal Salt Lake's sophomore season began much the way the rookie campaign ended.  The team recorded five losses and one tie in the first six matches of the season.  Overall, RSL had gone 18 consecutive matches without a victory \u2013 the longest winless streak in MLS history.  But despite hitting rock-bottom, the team responded positively.  On May 13, RSL routed LA Galaxy 3\u20130, with two goals scored by newly acquired forward [[Jeff Cunningham]].  It was the first road victory in team history.  A three-game homestand produced two wins and a tie, and suddenly Real looked like a playoff contender.\n\nHowever, their fortunes changed quickly, with four losses and two ties in the next six matches.  Yet RSL rebounded again, posting  five wins, one tie, and just one loss from mid-July to mid-August.  But the roller coaster season hit a low point with a demoralizing 6\u20130 loss at the hands of [[New York Red Bulls]].  The team managed two wins and four draws in the last eight matches, but failed to qualify for the playoffs, finishing with a 10-13-9 record.\n\nCunningham provided most of Real's highlights during the up-and-down 2006 season.  He had come to Salt Lake from Colorado - in exchange for Mathis, who had been a major disappointment for RSL.  Cunningham earned the [[MLS Golden Boot]] by scoring a league-high 16 goals.  He also added 11 assists, tied for the second-highest total in the MLS.\n\nDespite mixed results on the field, RSL scored a huge victory off the field in 2006.  After much controversy and debate (see main article), the franchise finally secured a guarantee for a state-of-the-art, soccer-specific stadium to be built in Sandy \u2013 a suburb of Salt Lake City.  The team broke ground for the structure on the morning of August 12, with representatives from soccer giant [[Real Madrid]] present, including superstar [[David Beckham]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06E0DD1330F931A25752C0A9619C8B63 | work=The New York Times | first=Harvey | last=Araton | title=SPORTS OF THE TIMES; American Soccer Takes a Bold Gamble On a Boldface Name | date=January 12, 2007}}</ref>   That evening, RSL faced its namesake in front of a sellout crowd of 45,511 fans at Rice-Eccles Stadium.  Salt Lake made a good showing, but Real Madrid won the exhibition match, 2\u20130.\n\nIn September 2006, representatives from Real Salt Lake and Real Madrid signed a 10-year agreement in which the two clubs agreed to work together to promote soccer throughout both [[Utah]] and the [[United States]]. Among the provisions included in the deal were a biennial friendly match between the two teams in [[Salt Lake City]]; annual February training for the RSL squad at Real Madrid's practice facility in Spain, and the creation of a $25 million youth academy in Salt Lake City that would train up to 200 youth players ranging from ages 12 to 18.<ref>[http://www.sltrib.com/sports/ci_4273347 Salt Lake Tribune article] announcing the RSL-RM deal</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20060902/ai_n16711063 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206163245/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20060902/ai_n16711063 |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 6, 2008 |title=Real Madrid will be back in '08 |publisher=Findarticles.com |date=September 2, 2006 |accessdate=October 11, 2011 }} </ref> However, the deal has seemed to have been dissolved, as none of the agreed upon provisions have come true: only one friendly match was ever played between the two sides, in 2006 (which the Madrid side won 2\u20130), and the planned soccer complex between the two has not come to fruition, with Salt Lake opening an academy on its own in [[Casa Grande, Arizona]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700112226/Whats-the-Real-deal-with-SL-soccer-complex.html?pg=all|title=What's the Real deal with S.L. soccer complex?|author=Jared Page|date=February 21, 2011|work=DeseretNews.com|accessdate=November 2, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/mls/2006-08-13-real-madrid-rsl-exhibition_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com - Real Madrid bests Real Salt Lake|publisher=|accessdate=November 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==2007==\n\nThe 2007 season opened with high hopes.  Real Salt Lake boasted a formidable attack with Cunningham and Kreis up front, joined by recently signed [[Panama]]nian international [[Luis Tejada]].  They were supported by veteran talent in the midfield and defense, such as [[Chris Klein (soccer)|Chris Klein]], [[Carey Talley]], and newly arrived goalkeeper [[Nick Rimando]].  But most of the pre-season buzz surrounded up-and-coming young players in the midfield.  [[Mehdi Ballouchy]] returned after a solid rookie season in 2006, and RSL acquired highly touted [[Freddy Adu]] in an off-season trade with [[D.C. United]].  At just 17 years old, Adu was already a three-year MLS veteran and was thought by some to be the future star of American soccer.\n\nBut the club's excitement quickly gave way to disappointment.   In the first match of the season, RSL controlled throughout, but a fluke goal by [[Carlos Ruiz (Guatemalan footballer)|Carlos Ruiz]] in the final minute of stoppage time salvaged a 2\u20132 draw for FC Dallas on Real's home turf.  RSL was devastated by the crushing result.  The players appeared lifeless as they were outscored 6\u20130 in their next three games.  In a stunning move, Ellinger was fired<ref>http://www.deseretnews.com/article/695198790/Tireless-Ellinger-setting-sails.html</ref> and replaced by Kreis, who immediately retired as a player.  Also, general manager Steve Pastorino resigned and was later replaced by [[Garth Lagerwey]].\n\nThe franchise launched a massive re-construction project that continued throughout the year.  Cunningham \u2013 who had feuded with Kreis on more than one occasion \u2013 was traded to Toronto.  Tejada was out-of-shape and played just two minutes for RSL before being released.  Adu left mid-season to pursue a career in [[Portugal]].  By the end of the year, several other key players \u2013 such as Ballouchy and Klein \u2013 had been traded away.  In addition, veteran defender Eddie Pope retired.  The team finished with a disappointing 6-15-9 record, missing the playoffs yet again.\n\n==2008==\n\nAlthough the previous season seemed like a giant step backwards for RSL, the team added several players in 2007 that provided a foundation for future success.  [[Kyle Beckerman]], [[Robbie Findley]], and [[Yura Movsisyan]] came to Salt Lake via trades from other MLS teams, while [[Fabi\u00e1n Esp\u00edndola]] and [[Javier Morales]] were brought from their native [[Argentina]] to bolster the offensive attack.  Early in 2008, the club added central defenders [[Nat Borchers]] and [[Jamison Olave]] to solidify the backline.   Rimando held off rookie [[Chris Seitz]] to remain the team's first-choice goalkeeper.\n\nAs Real established chemistry together, they emerged as a force to be reckoned with \u2013 at least in Salt Lake.  RSL marched through the regular season with just one loss at home, against eight wins and six ties.  The team's home field advantage improved dramatically in October with the opening of [[Rio Tinto Stadium]], the new soccer-specific stadium in Sandy.  However, road matches were a different story: RSL posted a dismal 2-9-4 record outside the state of Utah.\n\nBut when they desperately needed a road result in the last match of the regular season, the team came up big.  Movsisyan scored on a rebound shot in the 90th minute to secure a 1\u20131 draw in Colorado, good enough to clinch the first-ever playoff spot in franchise history.  2008 marked the first non-losing season for the club, as Real finished with a 10-10-10 record.  Also, Movsisyan's late strike gave the team a positive goal differential (40 goals for, 39 against) for the first time ever.\n\nRSL advanced past [[Chivas USA]] in the first round, winning 1\u20130 at home and drawing 2\u20132 on the road.  However, the season ended in disappointing fashion, as New York Red Bulls handed RSL a rare home loss in the Western Conference Final, ending Real's postseason run.  Despite the setback, optimism ran high in the organization, knowing that the team was moving in the right direction.  Beckerman provided strong leadership as team captain, and Morales emerged as the spearhead of the offense, setting a team record with 15 assists during the regular season.\n\n==2009==\n\n{{See also|2009 MLS Cup}}\nThe team and fans had hoped for dramatic improvement in 2009; however, the season progressed in much the same way as 2008.  Again, RSL proved nearly invincible at home, posting a 9-1-5 record in Rio Tinto Stadium, with a record-setting +23 goal differential.  However, yet again, the team struggled to maintain form during road matches.  In the final few weeks, RSL found itself in a five-way battle for the final two spots in the MLS playoffs \u2013 and Salt Lake had the fewest points of the five teams.  However, thanks to a 3\u20130 victory over Colorado in the final game of the regular season \u2013 combined with a miraculous series of results in several other matches around the league<ref>[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705339209/Real-Salt-Lake-Believe-it-RSL-earns-playoff-spot.html]</ref> \u2013 RSL clinched the 8th and final position in the playoffs.  Despite finishing with a losing record overall (11-12-7), the team was granted the last spot over two other teams through a tie-breaker formula (the Rapids and [[D.C. United]] also finished the year with 40 points each).\n\nAs a \"reward\" for qualifying, RSL faced the top-seeded [[Columbus Crew]] in the Eastern Conference bracket.  Led by [[Guillermo Barros Schelotto]], the Crew stood as the defending MLS champions, in addition to owning the best record in the league during the recent regular season.  Salt Lake therefore entered the two-match first round series as heavy underdogs.  Still, the team was not intimidated.  They used their strong home field advantage to post a 1\u20130 victory in the first match, and fought valiantly in the second leg, overcoming a 2\u20130 deficit to stun the Crew (3-2) in Columbus.\n\nHaving advanced on aggregate, Real now faced the [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]] in the second round.  With Mexican superstar [[Cuauhtemoc Blanco]], the Fire would be tough to beat \u2013 especially in a single match in Chicago, where RSL had never won before.  The teams played to a scoreless draw, and Salt Lake emerged victorious in the shootout (5-4) thanks to 3 huge saves by Rimando.  As improbable as it seemed, RSL claimed the Eastern Conference championship and advanced to face the LA Galaxy in the final match for the [[MLS Cup]].\n\nOver 46,000 fans packed into Seattle's [[Qwest Field]] to watch one of the most highly anticipated finals in MLS history.  The two teams were polar opposites.  The Galaxy were a well-established franchise, boasting several previous championships, in the giant metro area of Los Angeles.  Their roster included [[David Beckham]] \u2013 arguably the most famous athlete in the world at the time \u2013 along with American superstar [[Landon Donovan]], and several other well-known MLS veterans.  In contrast, Real Salt Lake was a small-market franchise with very little tradition and no star players.  Yet again, they found themselves heavy underdogs, but it was a role they relished.\n\nLA Galaxy struck first in the match, but Robbie Findley countered with a rebound shot in the 64th minute.  The teams battled to a 1\u20131 draw at the end of regulation, and neither team was able to score during the hard-fought overtime.  Each keeper made huge saves during the shootout, and the teams remained deadlocked after five rounds of penalty kicks.  After Rimando stopped a blast by [[Edson Buddle]] in the seventh round, [[Robbie Russell (soccer)|Robbie Russell]] buried his try, giving Real Salt Lake a 5\u20134 victory in the shootout and thus claiming the 2009 MLS Cup championship.  Rimando was named MVP for his standout performance as goalkeeper.\n\nRSL's title run remains one of the biggest upsets in American soccer, and stands as the only time in the history of major professional sports in the United States in which a team has claimed the league championship despite finishing the regular season with a losing record.<ref>[https://sports.yahoo.com/mls/news?slug=ro-realsaltlake111709]</ref>  Real Salt Lake was formally honored by President [[Barack Obama]] at a press conference in the [[White House]] on June 4, 2010.\n\n==2010==\n\nOn September 4, 2010, Real Salt Lake tied the MLS record set by the Columbus Crew the year prior (2008\u20132009) of 22 straight unbeaten games at home by beating the New York Red Bulls 1\u20130.

Real Salt Lake started their CONCACAF Champions League tournament on August 18 at [[Rio Tinto Stadium]] playing the Panamanian champions, \u00c1rabe Unido. Real Salt Lake won the game 2\u20131 with both goals scored by [[Alvaro Saborio]]. Next, Real Salt Lake went down to Mexico City to take on Cruz Azul on August 25. No American team had ever won in Mexico City before, and RSL looked to be the first. Late in the game, RSL had a commanding lead of 3 goals to 1 over Cruz Azul. However, Cruz Azul wasn't about to go down quietly, and within 12 minutes they put four goals on RSL to defeat them 5\u20134.\n\nOn September 15, 2010, Real Salt Lake took on Toronto FC at home, in Rio Tinto Stadium. Toronto struck early in the ninth minute, with a goal by Santos. However, Kyle Beckerman scored in the 21st minute, leading to three more goals throughout the match. RSL won the match 4\u20131, and took second place in Group A, behind Cruz Azul. Later that month, on September 22, Real Salt Lake went down to Panama to take on \u00c1rabe Unido for the 2nd time. This time, Real Salt Lake defeated \u00c1rabe Unido 3\u20132 on their home soil. Cruz Azul tied with Toronto FC the same night, and so RSL was on top of Group A with 9 points. Cruz Azul had 7 points with two more games for both teams to play.\n\nOn September 28, Real Salt Lake went north up to Canada to take on Toronto FC for a second time. RSL needed at least one more point to clinch one of the two top spots in their group in order to move on to the next round. The game ended up tying 1-1, giving RSL enough points to clinch the spot.\n\nThe 6th and final game for the first round of Group A came on October 19, when Cruz Azul came to Rio Tinto Stadium. Both teams stood on top of Group A with 10 points each, and the winner would take top of the group. With mostly second-tier players on the field, Real Salt Lake ended up beating Cruz Azul 3\u20131 in front of a record crowd of 20,463 fans, with two goals coming from rookie [[Paulo Araujo Jr.]] Real Salt Lake ended the first round at first place in Group A. This win also made Real Salt Lake the first ever MLS club to win its group in the CONCACAF Champions League.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usdish.com/rsl-concacaf-champions |title=Real Salt Lake, Club World Champions? |publisher=usdish.com |accessdate=2011-04-26}}</ref>\n\nAfter a lackluster 0\u20130 tie against the [[Columbus Crew]] in Columbus, Real Salt Lake defeated the Crew 4-1 back home on March 1, 2011 at Rio Tinto Stadium to advance to the semifinals. The win over Columbus made Real Salt Lake the first ever American team to advance past the quarterfinals of the CONCACAF Champions League, although two American have previously won the CONCACAF Champions Cup(LA Galaxy and DC United).\n\nOn March 15, 2011, Real Salt Lake beat Saprissa 2\u20130 in the first leg of the CONCACAF Champions League Semifinals at Rio Tinto Stadium and then lost 2\u20131 in Costa Rica on April 5, 2011. However, this was enough to secure advancement to the CONCACAF Champions League Final by an aggregate score of 3\u20132. Also, in doing so Real Salt Lake became the first MLS team to ever reach the CONCACAF Champions League Final.\n\nThanks in part to their performance in the Champions League, RSL became the first American club ever to crack the Top 25 World Rankings at WorldClubRankings.com (in April 2011).<ref>[http://www.worldclubrankings.com/2011/04/wcr-top-25-clubs-in-world-back-from.html World Club Rankings Top 25 - April 18, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630054702/http://www.worldclubrankings.com/2011/04/wcr-top-25-clubs-in-world-back-from.html |date=June 30, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nOn April 20, 2011, Real Salt Lake played their first leg of the CONCACAF Champions League Final at [[Estadio Tecnol\u00f3gico]] against [[CF Monterrey]].

Over the following months, the team added several players, including decorated MLS veterans [[Clint Mathis]] and [[Eddie Pope]].  Also, the team made arrangements to play home matches at [[Rice-Eccles Stadium]] on the campus of the [[University of Utah]], with hopes of eventually building a soccer-specific stadium in the [[Salt Lake City metropolitan area|Salt Lake area]] to host matches in the future.\n\n==2005==\n\nThe team played its first official match on April 2, slogging through a windy, rain-soaked<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/03/sports/soccer/03stars.html | work=The New York Times | first=Ron | last=Dicker | title=On a Night Unfit for Scoring, the MetroStars Slog to a Tie | date=April 3, 2005}}</ref> contest against [[New York Red Bulls|New York MetroStars]] at [[Giants Stadium]] in New Jersey.  That match ended as a scoreless draw.  The following week, Jason Kreis scored the first goal in franchise history in a 3-1 loss to [[LA Galaxy]] at the [[Home Depot Center]].  RSL returned to Utah to play its first-ever home match on April 16.  With 25,287 fans present at Rice-Eccles Stadium, [[Brian Dunseth]] scored a header in the 81st minute to deliver a 1-0 victory over the rival [[Colorado Rapids]].<ref>http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700264165/Real-Salt-Lake-Things-have-changed-a-lot-since-05-opener.html</ref>\n\nThe RSL faithful were thrilled, but from that point on, the season was mostly frustration and disappointment.  The team did log back-to-back victories in May, but high hopes were quickly dashed as RSL's offense sputtered.  The team set a league record by posting a 557-minute scoreless streak (later broken by [[Toronto FC]]).  Real recovered enough to log back-to-back wins later in the year, but again met with disaster: the team lost 10 consecutive matches before managing a 2-2 draw on the road against the [[San Jose Earthquakes]].  The season ended with a 1-0 loss at home against Colorado, giving RSL an overall record of 5-22-5 in the franchise's inaugural season.\n\nDespite the disappointing season, there were a few highlights.  In June, Salt Lake hosted a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] qualifier match between [[United States men's national soccer team|Team USA]] and [[Costa Rica]], drawing a boisterous crowd of 40,586 fans for the double-header at Rice-Eccles Stadium.<ref>http://www.mlssoccer.com/content/landon-donovan-kasey-keller-power-united-states-3-0-world-cup-qualifier-victory-over-costa-r</ref>  In August, Kreis notched his 100th career goal, becoming the first player in MLS history to reach that milestone.\n\n==2006==\n\nReal Salt Lake's sophomore season began much the way the rookie campaign ended.  The team recorded five losses and one tie in the first six matches of the season.  Overall, RSL had gone 18 consecutive matches without a victory \u2013 the longest winless streak in MLS history.  But despite hitting rock-bottom, the team responded positively.  On May 13, RSL routed LA Galaxy 3-0, with two goals scored by newly acquired forward [[Jeff Cunningham]].  It was the first road victory in team history.  A three-game homestand produced two wins and a tie, and suddenly Real looked like a playoff contender.\n\nHowever, their fortunes changed quickly, with four losses and two ties in the next six matches.  Yet RSL rebounded again, posting  five wins, one tie, and just one loss from mid-July to mid-August.  But the roller coaster season hit a low point with a demoralizing 6-0 loss at the hands of [[New York Red Bulls]].  The team managed two wins and four draws in the last eight matches, but failed to qualify for the playoffs, finishing with a 10-13-9 record.\n\nCunningham provided most of Real's highlights during the up-and-down 2006 season.  He had come to Salt Lake from Colorado - in exchange for Mathis, who had been a major disappointment for RSL.  Cunningham earned the [[MLS Golden Boot]] by scoring a league-high 16 goals.  He also added 11 assists, tied for the second-highest total in the MLS.\n\nDespite mixed results on the field, RSL scored a huge victory off the field in 2006.  After much controversy and debate (see main article), the franchise finally secured a guarantee for a state-of-the-art, soccer-specific stadium to be built in Sandy \u2013 a suburb of Salt Lake City.  The team broke ground for the structure on the morning of August 12, with representatives from soccer giant [[Real Madrid]] present, including superstar [[David Beckham]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06E0DD1330F931A25752C0A9619C8B63 | work=The New York Times | first=Harvey | last=Araton | title=SPORTS OF THE TIMES; American Soccer Takes a Bold Gamble On a Boldface Name | date=January 12, 2007}}</ref>   That evening, RSL faced its namesake in front of a sellout crowd of 45,511 fans at Rice-Eccles Stadium.

Real Salt Lake boasted a formidable attack with Cunningham and Kreis up front, joined by recently signed [[Panama]]nian international [[Luis Tejada]].  They were supported by veteran talent in the midfield and defense, such as [[Chris Klein (soccer)|Chris Klein]], [[Carey Talley]], and newly arrived goalkeeper [[Nick Rimando]].  But most of the pre-season buzz surrounded up-and-coming young players in the midfield.  [[Mehdi Ballouchy]] returned after a solid rookie season in 2006, and RSL acquired highly touted [[Freddy Adu]] in an off-season trade with [[D.C. United]].  At just 17 years old, Adu was already a three-year MLS veteran and was thought by some to be the future star of American soccer.\n\nBut the club's excitement quickly gave way to disappointment.   In the first match of the season, RSL controlled throughout, but a fluke goal by [[Carlos Ruiz (Guatemalan footballer)|Carlos Ruiz]] in the final minute of stoppage time salvaged a 2-2 draw for FC Dallas on Real's home turf.  RSL was devastated by the crushing result.  The players appeared lifeless as they were outscored 6-0 in their next three games.  In a stunning move, Ellinger was fired<ref>http://www.deseretnews.com/article/695198790/Tireless-Ellinger-setting-sails.html</ref> and replaced by Kreis, who immediately retired as a player.  Also, general manager Steve Pastorino resigned and was later replaced by [[Garth Lagerwey]].\n\nThe franchise launched a massive re-construction project that continued throughout the year.  Cunningham \u2013 who had feuded with Kreis on more than one occasion \u2013 was traded to Toronto.  Tejada was out-of-shape and played just two minutes for RSL before being released.  Adu left mid-season to pursue a career in [[Portugal]].  By the end of the year, several other key players \u2013 such as Ballouchy and Klein \u2013 had been traded away.  In addition, veteran defender Eddie Pope retired.  The team finished with a disappointing 6-15-9 record, missing the playoffs yet again.\n\n==2008==\n\nAlthough the previous season seemed like a giant step backwards for RSL, the team added several players in 2007 that provided a foundation for future success.  [[Kyle Beckerman]], [[Robbie Findley]], and [[Yura Movsisyan]] came to Salt Lake via trades from other MLS teams, while [[Fabi\u00e1n Esp\u00edndola]] and [[Javier Morales]] were brought from their native [[Argentina]] to bolster the offensive attack.  Early in 2008, the club added central defenders [[Nat Borchers]] and [[Jamison Olave]] to solidify the backline.   Rimando held off rookie [[Chris Seitz]] to remain the team's first-choice goalkeeper.\n\nAs Real established chemistry together, they emerged as a force to be reckoned with \u2013 at least in Salt Lake.  RSL marched through the regular season with just one loss at home, against eight wins and six ties.  The team's home field advantage improved dramatically in October with the opening of [[Rio Tinto Stadium]], the new soccer-specific stadium in Sandy.  However, road matches were a different story: RSL posted a dismal 2-9-4 record outside the state of Utah.\n\nBut when they desperately needed a road result in the last match of the regular season, the team came up big.  Movsisyan scored on a rebound shot in the 90th minute to secure a 1-1 draw in Colorado, good enough to clinch the first-ever playoff spot in franchise history.  2008 marked the first non-losing season for the club, as Real finished with a 10-10-10 record.  Also, Movsisyan's late strike gave the team a positive goal differential (40 goals for, 39 against) for the first time ever.\n\nRSL advanced past [[Chivas USA]] in the first round, winning 1-0 at home and drawing 2-2 on the road.  However, the season ended in disappointing fashion, as New York Red Bulls handed RSL a rare home loss in the Western Conference Final, ending Real's postseason run.  Despite the setback, optimism ran high in the organization, knowing that the team was moving in the right direction.  Beckerman provided strong leadership as team captain, and Morales emerged as the spearhead of the offense, setting a team record with 15 assists during the regular season.\n\n==2009==\n\n{{See also|2009 MLS Cup}}\nThe team and fans had hoped for dramatic improvement in 2009; however, the season progressed in much the same way as 2008.  Again, RSL proved nearly invincible at home, posting a 9-1-5 record in Rio Tinto Stadium, with a record-setting +23 goal differential.  However, yet again, the team struggled to maintain form during road matches.  In the final few weeks, RSL found itself in a five-way battle for the final two spots in the MLS playoffs \u2013 and Salt Lake had the fewest points of the five teams.  However, thanks to a 3-0 victory over Colorado in the final game of the regular season \u2013 combined with a miraculous series of results in several other matches around the league<ref>[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705339209/Real-Salt-Lake-Believe-it-RSL-earns-playoff-spot.html]</ref> \u2013 RSL clinched the 8th and final position in the playoffs.  Despite finishing with a losing record overall (11-12-7), the team was granted the last spot over two other teams through a tie-breaker formula (the Rapids and [[D.C. United]] also finished the year with 40 points each).\n\nAs a \"reward\" for qualifying, RSL faced the top-seeded [[Columbus Crew]] in the Eastern Conference bracket.  Led by [[Guillermo Barros Schelotto]], the Crew stood as the defending MLS champions, in addition to owning the best record in the league during the recent regular season.  Salt Lake therefore entered the two-match first round series as heavy underdogs.  Still, the team was not intimidated.  They used their strong home field advantage to post a 1-0 victory in the first match, and fought valiantly in the second leg, overcoming a 2-0 deficit to stun the Crew (3-2) in Columbus.\n\nHaving advanced on aggregate, Real now faced the [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]] in the second round.  With Mexican superstar [[Cuauhtemoc Blanco]], the Fire would be tough to beat \u2013 especially in a single match in Chicago, where RSL had never won before.  The teams played to a scoreless draw, and Salt Lake emerged victorious in the shootout (5-4) thanks to 3 huge saves by Rimando.  As improbable as it seemed, RSL claimed the Eastern Conference championship and advanced to face the LA Galaxy in the final match for the [[MLS Cup]].\n\nOver 46,000 fans packed into Seattle's [[Qwest Field]] to watch one of the most highly anticipated finals in MLS history.  The two teams were polar opposites.  The Galaxy were a well-established franchise, boasting several previous championships, in the giant metro area of Los Angeles.  Their roster included [[David Beckham]] \u2013 arguably the most famous athlete in the world at the time \u2013 along with American superstar [[Landon Donovan]], and several other well-known MLS veterans.  In contrast, Real Salt Lake was a small-market franchise with very little tradition and no star players.  Yet again, they found themselves heavy underdogs, but it was a role they relished.\n\nLA Galaxy struck first in the match, but Robbie Findley countered with a rebound shot in the 64th minute.  The teams battled to a 1-1 draw at the end of regulation, and neither team was able to score during the hard-fought overtime.  Each keeper made huge saves during the shootout, and the teams remained deadlocked after five rounds of penalty kicks.  After Rimando stopped a blast by [[Edson Buddle]] in the seventh round, [[Robbie Russell (soccer)|Robbie Russell]] buried his try, giving Real Salt Lake a 5-4 victory in the shootout and thus claiming the 2009 MLS Cup championship.  Rimando was named MVP for his standout performance as goalkeeper.\n\nRSL's title run remains one of the biggest upsets in American soccer, and stands as the only time in the history of major professional sports in the United States in which a team has claimed the league championship despite finishing the regular season with a losing record.<ref>[https://sports.yahoo.com/mls/news?slug=ro-realsaltlake111709]</ref>  Real Salt Lake was formally honored by President [[Barack Obama]] at a press conference in the [[White House]] on June 4, 2010.\n\n==2010==\n\nOn September 4, 2010, Real Salt Lake tied the MLS record set by the Columbus Crew the year prior (2008\u20132009) of 22 straight unbeaten games at home by beating the New York Red Bulls 1\u20130. Real Salt Lake has not lost a league game at home since May 2009.\n\nOn October 16, 2010 Real Salt Lake improved their home unbeaten streak to 25 games in a row after beating the FC Dallas 2\u20130.

Real Salt Lake started their CONCACAF Champions League tournament on August 18 at [[Rio Tinto Stadium]] playing the Panamanian champions, \u00c1rabe Unido. Real Salt Lake won the game 2\u20131 with both goals scored by [[Alvaro Saborio]]. Next, Real Salt Lake went down to Mexico City to take on Cruz Azul on August 25. No American team had ever won in Mexico City before, and RSL looked to be the first. Late in the game, RSL had a commanding lead of 3 goals to 1 over Cruz Azul. However, Cruz Azul wasn't about to go down quietly, and within 12 minutes they put four goals on RSL to defeat them 5-4.\n\nOn September 15, 2010, Real Salt Lake took on Toronto FC at home, in Rio Tinto Stadium. Toronto struck early in the ninth minute, with a goal by Santos. However, Kyle Beckerman scored in the 21st minute, leading to three more goals throughout the match. RSL won the match 4\u20131, and took second place in Group A, behind Cruz Azul. Later that month, on September 22, Real Salt Lake went down to Panama to take on \u00c1rabe Unido for the 2nd time. This time, Real Salt Lake defeated \u00c1rabe Unido 3\u20132 on their home soil. Cruz Azul tied with Toronto FC the same night, and so RSL was on top of Group A with 9 points. Cruz Azul had 7 points with two more games for both teams to play.\n\nOn September 28, Real Salt Lake went north up to Canada to take on Toronto FC for a second time. RSL needed at least one more point to clinch one of the two top spots in their group in order to move on to the next round. The game ended up tying 1-1, giving RSL enough points to clinch the spot.\n\nThe 6th and final game for the first round of Group A came on October 19, when Cruz Azul came to Rio Tinto Stadium. Both teams stood on top of Group A with 10 points each, and the winner would take top of the group. With mostly second-tier players on the field, Real Salt Lake ended up beating Cruz Azul 3\u20131 in front of a record crowd of 20,463 fans, with two goals coming from rookie [[Paulo Araujo Jr.]] Real Salt Lake ended the first round at first place in Group A. This win also made Real Salt Lake the first ever MLS club to win its group in the CONCACAF Champions League.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usdish.com/rsl-concacaf-champions |title=Real Salt Lake, Club World Champions? |publisher=usdish.com |accessdate=2011-04-26}}</ref>\n\nAfter a lackluster 0-0 tie against the [[Columbus Crew]] in Columbus, Real Salt Lake defeated the Crew 4-1 back home on March 1, 2011 at Rio Tinto Stadium to advance to the semifinals. The win over Columbus made Real Salt Lake the first ever American team to advance past the quarterfinals of the CONCACAF Champions League, although two American have previously won the CONCACAF Champions Cup(LA Galaxy and DC United).\n\nOn March 15, 2011, Real Salt Lake beat Saprissa 2-0 in the first leg of the CONCACAF Champions League Semifinals at Rio Tinto Stadium and then lost 2-1 in Costa Rica on April 5, 2011. However, this was enough to secure advancement to the CONCACAF Champions League Final by an aggregate score of 3-2. Also, in doing so Real Salt Lake became the first MLS team to ever reach the CONCACAF Champions League Final.\n\nThanks in part to their performance in the Champions League, RSL became the first American club ever to crack the Top 25 World Rankings at WorldClubRankings.com (in April 2011).<ref>[http://www.worldclubrankings.com/2011/04/wcr-top-25-clubs-in-world-back-from.html World Club Rankings Top 25 - April 18, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630054702/http://www.worldclubrankings.com/2011/04/wcr-top-25-clubs-in-world-back-from.html |date=June 30, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nOn April 20, 2011, Real Salt Lake played their first leg of the CONCACAF Champions League Final at [[Estadio Tecnol\u00f3gico]] against [[CF Monterrey]].

In the spring of 1795, Harvey Redinbo, a [[Pennsylvania Dutch]]man, visited from [[Reading, Pennsylvania]]. Pleased with the land that Voorhees had acquired, Redinbo purchased his own land, in the area of Hunt Road and Columbia Avenue. Around 1798, Voorhees [[plat]]ted a town named Voorhees-Town but did not record it with county officials until January 7, 1804. By then, Redinbo had convinced him to rename the town to Reading, after Redinbo's hometown.<ref name=\"Nelson\">{{cite book|title=History of Cincinnati and Hamilton County, Ohio: Their Past and Present, Including...biographies and Portraits of Pioneers and Representative Citizens, etc.|volume=1|first=S.

'The motto (on the flag) reflects the German ancestry of our city.'}} [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/28535974/]</ref>\n\n<!-- Images -->\n|image_skyline            = Benson east of Lind, Reading.jpg\n|imagesize                = 250px\n|image_caption            = Benson Street downtown\n|image_flag               = \n|image_seal               =\n\n<!-- Maps -->\n|image_map                = Hamilton County Ohio Incorporated and Unincorporated areas Reading highlighted.svg\n|mapsize                  = 250px\n|map_caption              = Location in [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton County]] and the state of [[Ohio]].\n\n<!-- Location -->\n|subdivision_type         = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n|subdivision_name         = United States\n|subdivision_type1        = [[U.S. state|State]]\n|subdivision_name1        = [[Ohio]]\n|subdivision_type2        = [[List of counties in Ohio|County]]\n|subdivision_name2        = [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton]]\n\n<!-- Government -->\n|government_footnotes     = \n|government_type          = \n|leader_title             = Mayor\n|leader_name              = Robert Bemmes ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]])<ref>{{cite web|title=Hamilton County Officials 2016|url=http://boe.hamilton-co.org/files/files/Offices_Candidate/2016/HAM%20CO%20ELECTED%20OFFICIALS%202016(1).pdf#page=20|website=Hamilton County Board of Elections|accessdate=1 February 2016|page=20|date=27 January 2016}}</ref>\n|leader_title1            = \n|leader_name1             = \n|established_title1        = Settled\n|established_date1         = 1797\n|established_title2        = Incorporated\n|established_date2         = March 24, 1851\n|established_title3        = Became a city\n|established_date3         = January 1, 1932\n|established_title4        = Withdrew from [[Sycamore Township, Hamilton County, Ohio|Sycamore Township]]\n|established_date4         = May 19, 1943\n\n<!-- Area -->\n|unit_pref                = Imperial\n|area_footnotes           = <ref name=\"Gazetteer files\"/>\n|area_magnitude           = \n|area_total_km2           = 7.49\n|area_land_km2            = 7.49\n|area_water_km2           = 0\n|area_total_sq_mi         = 2.89\n|area_land_sq_mi          = 2.89\n|area_water_sq_mi         = 0\n\n<!-- Population -->\n|population_as_of         = [[2010 United States Census|2010]]\n|population_est           = 10264\n|pop_est_as_of            = 2018<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 12, 2019}}</ref>\n|population_footnotes     = <ref name=\"FactFinder\"/>\n|population_total         = 10385\n|population_density_km2   = 1387.4\n|population_density_sq_mi = 3593.4\n\n<!-- General information -->\n|timezone                 = [[North American Eastern Time Zone|Eastern (EST)]]\n|utc_offset               = -5\n|timezone_DST             = EDT\n|utc_offset_DST           = -4\n|elevation_footnotes      = <ref name=\"GR3\">{{cite web|url=http://geonames.usgs.gov|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=US Board on Geographic Names|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|date=2007-10-25}}</ref>\n|elevation_m              = 171\n|elevation_ft             = 561\n|coordinates              = {{coord|39|13|22|N|84|26|21|W|region:US_type:city|display=inline,title}}\n|postal_code_type         = [[ZIP code]]s\n|postal_code              = 45215, 45236, 45237\n|area_code                = [[Area code 513|513]]\n|blank_name               = [[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS code]]\n|blank_info               = 39-65732<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212221153/http://factfinder.census.gov/main.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=American FactFinder}}</ref>\n|blank1_name              = [[Geographic Names Information System|GNIS]] feature ID\n|blank1_info              = 1056486<ref name=\"GR3\" />\n|website                  = {{URL|www.readingohio.org}}\n|footnotes                = \n}}\n\n'''Reading''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|r|\u025b|d|\u026a|\u014b}} {{respell|RED|ing}}) is a [[city]] in [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton County]], [[Ohio]], United States.
