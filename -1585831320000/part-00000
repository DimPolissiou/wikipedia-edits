Since Saturn (Cronus) ruled over the [[Earth]], the [[heaven]]s and the [[sea]], she hid him by dangling him on a [[rope]] from a [[tree]] so he was suspended between earth, sea and sky and thus, invisible to his father.\n# According to Pseudo-Apollodorus (Bibliotheca, [http://www.theoi.com/Text/Apollodorus1.html#1 1.1.5-7])) Zeus was raised by a [[goat]] named [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]] in a cave called Dictaeon Antron ([[Psychro Cave]]). A a company of soldiers called [[Kouretes]] danced, shouted and clashed their spears against their shields so that Cronus would not hear the baby's cry.\n\n===King of the gods===\n\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter reaching manhood, Zeus forced Cronus to disgorge first the stone (which was set down at [[Pytho]] under the glens of [[Parnassus]] to be a sign to mortal men, the [[Omphalos]]) then his siblings in reverse order of swallowing. In some versions, [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]] gave Cronus an [[emetic]] to force him to disgorge the babies, or Zeus cut Cronus's [[stomach]] open. Then Zeus released the brothers of Cronus, the [[Hekatonkheires|Hecatonchires]] and the [[Cyclopes]], from their dungeon in [[Tartarus]], killing their guard, [[Campe]].\n\nAs a token of their appreciation, the Cyclopes gave him [[thunder]] and the thunderbolt, or [[lightning]], which had previously been hidden by Gaia. Together, Zeus, his brothers and sisters, Hecatonchires and Cyclopes overthrew Cronus and the other Titans, in the combat called the [[Titanomachy]]. The defeated Titans were then cast into a shadowy underworld region known as Tartarus. [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], one of the titans who fought against Zeus, was punished by having to hold up the sky.[[File:Zeus Getty Villa.jpg|thumb|First century statue of Zeus]]\n\nAfter the battle with the Titans, Zeus shared the world with his elder brothers, [[Poseidon]] and [[Hades]], by drawing lots: Zeus got the sky and air, Poseidon the waters, and Hades the world of the dead (the underworld). The ancient Earth, [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], could not be claimed; she was left to all three, each according to their capabilities, which explains why Poseidon was the \"earth-shaker\" (the god of earthquakes) and Hades claimed the humans who died (see also [[Penthus]]).\n\nGaia resented the way Zeus had treated the Titans, because they were her children. Soon after taking the throne as king of the gods, Zeus had to fight some of Gaia's other children, the [[monster]]s [[Typhon]] and [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]]. He vanquished Typhon and trapped him under [[Mount Etna]], but left Echidna and her children alive.\n\n===Conflicts with humans===\n<!-- Since Greek mythology, as far as I understand, is essentially a loose collection of stories told by several groups in Ancient Greece where none can be considered the \"official canon\", this should really be prefaced with \"In the writings of (Greek author)...\" or \"In (work)...\", and several of the sentences describe details that probably vary by telling. -->\nWhen Zeus was atop Mount Olympus he was appalled by human sacrifice and other signs of human decadence. He decided to wipe out mankind and flooded the world with the help of his brother [[Poseidon]].

Their quadrennial [[festival]] featured the famous Games. There was also an altar to Zeus made not of stone, but of ash, from the accumulated remains of many centuries' worth of animals sacrificed there.\n\nOutside of the major inter-[[polis]] sanctuaries, there were no modes of worshipping Zeus precisely shared across the Greek world. Most of the titles listed below, for instance, could be found at any number of [[Greek temple]]s from [[Asia Minor]] to [[Sicily]]. Certain modes of ritual were held in common as well: sacrificing a white animal over a raised altar, for instance.\n\n====Zeus Velchanos====\n\nWith one exception, Greeks were unanimous in recognizing the birthplace of Zeus as Crete. Minoan culture contributed many essentials of ancient Greek religion: \"by a hundred channels the old civilization emptied itself into the new\", Will Durant observed,<ref>Durant, ''The Life of Greece'' (''The Story of Civilization'' Part II, New York: Simon & Schuster) 1939:23.</ref> and Cretan Zeus retained his youthful Minoan features. The local child of the Great Mother, \"a small and inferior deity who took the roles of son and consort\",<ref>Rodney Castleden, ''Minoans: Life in Bronze-Age Crete'', \"The Minoan belief-system\" (Routledge) 1990:125</ref> whose Minoan name the Greeks Hellenized as Velchanos, was in time assumed as an [[epithet]] by Zeus, as transpired at many other sites, and he came to be venerated in Crete as '''Zeus Velchanos''' (\"boy-Zeus\"), often simply the ''[[Kouros]]''.\n\nIn [[Crete]], Zeus was worshipped at a number of caves at [[Knossos]], [[Mount Ida, Crete|Ida]] and [[Palaikastro]]. In the Hellenistic period a small sanctuary dedicated to Zeus Velchanos was founded at the [[Hagia Triada]] site of a long-ruined Minoan palace. Broadly contemporary coins from [[Phaistos]] show the form under which he was worshiped: a youth sits among the branches of a tree, with a cockerel on his knees.<ref>Pointed out by Bernard Clive Dietrich, ''The Origins of Greek Religion'' (de Gruyter) 1973:15.</ref> On other Cretan coins Velchanos is represented as an eagle and in association with a goddess celebrating a mystic marriage.<ref>A.B. Cook, ''Zeus'' Cambridge University Press, 1914, I, figs 397, 398.</ref> Inscriptions at [[Gortyn]] and Lyttos record a ''Velchania'' festival, showing that Velchanios was still widely venerated in Hellenistic Crete.<ref>Dietrich 1973, noting [[Martin P. Nilsson]], ''Minoan-Mycenaean Religion, and Its Survival in Greek Religion'' 1950:551 and notes.</ref>\n\nThe stories of [[Minos]] and [[Epimenides]] suggest that these caves were once used for [[Incubation (ritual)|incubatory]] divination by kings and priests. The dramatic setting of [[Plato]]'s ''Laws'' is along the pilgrimage-route to one such site, emphasizing archaic Cretan knowledge. On Crete, Zeus was represented in art as a long-haired youth rather than a mature adult and hymned as ''ho megas kouros'', \"the great youth\". Ivory statuettes of the \"Divine Boy\" were unearthed near the [[Labyrinth]] at [[Knossos]] by [[Sir Arthur Evans]].<ref>\"Professor [[Stylianos Alexiou]] reminds us that there were other divine boys who survived from the religion of the pre-Hellenic period \u2014 [[Linos]], [[Ploutos]] and [[Dionysos]] \u2014 so not all the young male deities we see depicted in Minoan works of art are necessarily Velchanos\" (Castleden 1990:125</ref> With the [[Kouretes]], a band of ecstatic armed dancers, he presided over the rigorous military-athletic training and secret rites of the Cretan ''[[paideia]]''.\n\nThe myth of the death of Cretan Zeus, localised in numerous mountain sites though only mentioned in a comparatively late source, [[Callimachus]],<ref>Richard Wyatt Hutchinson, ''Prehistoric Crete'', (Harmondsworth: Penguin) 1968:204, mentions that there is no classical reference to the death of Zeus (noted by Dietrich 1973:16 note 78).</ref> together with the assertion of [[Antoninus Liberalis]] that a fire shone forth annually from the birth-cave the infant shared with a [[Bees (mythology)|mythic swarm of bees]], suggests that Velchanos had been an annual vegetative spirit.<ref>\"This annually reborn god of vegetation also experienced the other parts of the vegetation cycle: holy marriage and annual death when he was thought to disappear from the earth\" (Dietrich 1973:15).</ref>\nThe Hellenistic writer [[Euhemerus]] apparently proposed a theory that Zeus had actually been a great king of [[Crete]] and that posthumously, his glory had slowly turned him into a deity. The works of Euhemerus himself have not survived, but Christian [[patristic]] writers took up the suggestion.\n\n====Zeus Lykaios====\n{{details|Lykaia}}\n\n[[File:Stater Zeus Lampsacus CdM.jpg|thumb|[[Laurel wreath|Laurel-wreathed]] head of Zeus on a gold [[stater]], [[Lampsacus]], c 360\u2013340 BC ([[Cabinet des M\u00e9dailles]]).]]\nThe epithet '''Zeus Lykaios''' (\"wolf-Zeus\") is assumed by Zeus only in connection with the archaic festival of the [[Lykaia]] on the slopes of [[Lycaeus|Mount Lykaion]] (\"Wolf Mountain\"), the tallest peak in rustic [[Arcadia]]; Zeus had only a formal connection<ref>In the founding myth of [[Lycaon (mythology)|Lycaon]]'s banquet for the gods that included the flesh of a human sacrifice, perhaps one of his sons, [[Nyctimus]] or [[Arcas]]. Zeus overturned the table and struck the house of Lyceus with a thunderbolt; his patronage at the Lykaia can have been little more than a formula.</ref> with the rituals and myths of this primitive [[rite of passage]] with an ancient threat of [[cannibalism]] and the possibility of a [[werewolf]] transformation for the [[ephebos|ephebes]] who were the participants.<ref>A morphological connection to ''lyke'' \"brightness\" may be merely fortuitous.</ref> Near the ancient ash-heap where the sacrifices took place<ref>Modern archaeologists have found no trace of human remains among the sacrificial detritus, [[Walter Burkert]], \"Lykaia and Lykaion\", ''Homo Necans'', tr. by Peter Bing ([[University of California]]) 1983, p. 90.</ref> was a forbidden precinct in which, allegedly, no shadows were ever cast.<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 8.38.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Plato]],<ref>''Republic'' 565d-e</ref>  a particular clan would gather on the mountain to make a sacrifice every nine years to Zeus Lykaios, and a single morsel of human entrails would be intermingled with the animal's. Whoever ate the human flesh was said to turn into a wolf, and could only regain human form if he did not eat again of human flesh until the next nine-year cycle had ended. There were games associated with the Lykaia, removed in the fourth century to the first urbanization of Arcadia, [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopolis]]; there the major temple was dedicated to Zeus Lykaios.\n\nThere is, however, the crucial detail that ''Lykaios'' or ''Lykeios'' (epithets of Zeus and Apollo) may derive from [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]] *{{lang|grc|\u03bb\u03cd\u03ba\u03b7}}, \"light\", a noun still attested in compounds such as {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cd\u03ba\u03b7}}, \"twilight\", {{lang|grc|\u03bb\u03c5\u03ba\u03ac\u03b2\u03b1\u03c2}}, \"year\" (lit. \"light's course\") etc. This, Cook argues, brings indeed much new 'light' to the matter as [[Achaeus of Eretria|Achaeus]], the contemporary tragedian of [[Sophocles]], spoke of Zeus Lykaios as \"starry-eyed\", and this Zeus Lykaios may just be the Arcadian Zeus, son of Aether, described by [[Cicero]]. Again under this new signification may be seen [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]' descriptions of Lykosoura being 'the first city that ever the sun beheld', and of the altar of Zeus, at the summit of Mount Lykaion, before which stood two columns bearing gilded eagles and 'facing the sun-rise'. Further Cook sees only the tale of Zeus' sacred precinct at Mount Lykaion allowing no shadows referring to Zeus as 'god of light' (Lykaios).<ref>A. B. Cook ('''1914'''), ''Zeus: A Study in Ancient Religion'', Vol. I, p.63, Cambridge University Press</ref>[[File:Statue of Zeus.jpg|thumb|A statue of Zeus in a drawing.]]\n\n====Additional cults of Zeus====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\nAlthough etymology indicates that Zeus was originally a sky god, many Greek cities honored a local Zeus who lived underground. Athenians and Sicilians honored '''Zeus Meilichios''' (\"kindly\" or \"honeyed\") while other cities had '''Zeus Chthonios''' (\"earthy\"), '''Zeus Katachthonios''' (\"under-the-earth\") and '''Zeus Plousios''' (\"wealth-bringing\"). These deities might be represented as snakes or in human form in visual art, or, for emphasis as both together in one image. They also received offerings of black animal victims sacrificed into sunken pits, as did [[chthonic]] deities like [[Persephone]] and [[Demeter]], and also the [[hero]]es at their tombs. Olympian gods, by contrast, usually received white victims sacrificed upon raised altars.\n\nIn some cases, cities were not entirely sure whether the ''daimon'' to whom they sacrificed was a hero or an underground Zeus. Thus the shrine at Lebadaea in [[Boeotia]] might belong to the hero [[Trophonius]] or to '''Zeus Trephonius''' (\"the nurturing\"), depending on whether you believe [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], or [[Strabo]]. The hero [[Amphiaraus]] was honored as '''Zeus Amphiaraus''' at Oropus outside of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], and the Spartans even had a shrine to '''Zeus Agamemnon'''. Ancient [[Molossians|Molossian]] kings sacrificed to '''[[Zeus Areius]]'''. [[Strabo]] mention that at [[Tralles]] there was the '''Zeus Larisaeus'''.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239%3Abook%3D14%3Achapter%3D1%3Asection%3D42 Strabo, Geography,  book 14, chapter 1.42]</ref>\n\n===Non-panhellenic cults===\n[[File:Museo Barracco - Giove Ammone 1010637.JPG|thumb|Roman cast [[terracotta]] of ram-horned ''Jupiter Ammon'', 1st century AD ([[Museo Barracco]], Rome).]]\n\nIn addition to the Panhellenic titles and conceptions listed above, local cults maintained their own idiosyncratic ideas about the king of gods and men.  With the epithet '''Zeus [[Aetnaeus]]''' he was worshiped on [[Mount Etna|Mount Aetna]], where there was a statue of him, and a local festival called the Aetnaea in his honor.<ref>Schol. ''ad Pind. Ol.'' vi. 162</ref> Other examples are listed below. As '''Zeus Aeneius''' or '''Zeus Aenesius''', he was worshiped in the island of [[Cephalonia]], where he had a temple on [[Mount Ainos|Mount Aenos]].<ref>Hesiod, according to a scholium on Apollonius of Rhodes. ''Argonautika'', ii. 297</ref>\n\n===Oracles of Zeus===\nAlthough most oracle sites were usually dedicated to [[Apollo]], the heroes, or various goddesses like [[Themis]], a few oracular sites were dedicated to Zeus. In addition, some foreign oracles, such as [[Ba\u02bfal]]'s at [[Heliopolis (Syria)|Heliopolis]], were [[interpretatio graeca|associated]] with Zeus in Greek or [[Jupiter]] in Latin.\n\n====The Oracle at Dodona====\n\nThe cult of Zeus at [[Dodona]] in [[Epirus]], where there is evidence of religious activity from the second millennium BC onward, centered on a sacred oak. When the ''[[Odyssey]]'' was composed (circa 750 BC), divination was done there by barefoot priests called ''Selloi'', who lay on the ground and observed the rustling of the leaves and branches.<ref>''Odyssey'' 14.326-7</ref> By the time [[Herodotus]] wrote about Dodona, female priestesses called [[peleiades]] (\"doves\") had replaced the male priests.\n\nZeus' consort at Dodona was not [[Hera]], but the goddess [[Dione (Titaness/Oceanid)|Dione]] \u2014 whose name is a feminine form of \"Zeus\". Her status as a [[Titan (mythology)|titaness]] suggests to some that she may have been a more powerful pre-Hellenic deity, and perhaps the original occupant of the oracle.\n\n==== The Oracle at Siwa ====\nThe [[oracle of Ammon]] at the [[Siwa Oasis]] in the Western Desert of [[Egypt]] did not lie within the bounds of the Greek world before [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s day, but it already loomed large in the Greek mind during the archaic era: [[Herodotus]] mentions consultations with Zeus Ammon in his account of the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian War]]. Zeus Ammon was especially favored at [[Sparta]], where a temple to him existed by the time of the [[Peloponnesian War]].<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 3.18.</ref>\n\nAfter Alexander made a trek into the desert to consult the oracle at Siwa, the figure arose in the Hellenistic imagination of a [[Libyan Sibyl]].\n\n==Gnostic literature==\n[[Pistis Sophia]], a piece belonging to [[Gnosticism]] shown to date back at least to the 4th century AD,<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Birger A.

Since Saturn (Cronus) ruled over the [[Earth]], the [[heaven]]s and the [[sea]], she hid him by dangling him on a [[rope]] from a [[tree]] so he was suspended between earth, sea and sky and thus, invisible to his father.\n# According to Pseudo-Apollodorus (Bibliotheca, [http://www.theoi.com/Text/Apollodorus1.html#1 1.1.5-7])) Zeus was raised by a [[goat]] named [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]] in a cave called Dictaeon Antron ([[Psychro Cave]]). A a company of soldiers called [[Kouretes]] danced, shouted and clashed their spears against their shields so that Cronus would not hear the baby's cry.\n\n===King of the gods===\n\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter reaching manhood, Zeus forced Cronus to disgorge first the stone (which was set down at [[Pytho]] under the glens of [[Parnassus]] to be a sign to mortal men, the [[Omphalos]]) then his siblings in reverse order of swallowing. In some versions, [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]] gave Cronus an [[emetic]] to force him to disgorge the babies, or Zeus cut Cronus's [[stomach]] open. Then Zeus released the brothers of Cronus, the [[Hekatonkheires|Hecatonchires]] and the [[Cyclopes]], from their dungeon in [[Tartarus]], killing their guard, [[Campe]].\n\nAs a token of their appreciation, the Cyclopes gave him [[thunder]] and the thunderbolt, or [[lightning]], which had previously been hidden by Gaia. Together, Zeus, his brothers and sisters, Hecatonchires and Cyclopes overthrew Cronus and the other Titans, in the combat called the [[Titanomachy]]. The defeated Titans were then cast into a shadowy underworld region known as Tartarus. [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], one of the titans who fought against Zeus, was punished by having to hold up the sky.[[File:Zeus Getty Villa.jpg|thumb|First century statue of Zeus]]\n\nAfter the battle with the Titans, Zeus shared the world with his elder brothers, [[Poseidon]] and [[Hades]], by drawing lots: Zeus got the sky and air, Poseidon the waters, and Hades the world of the dead (the underworld). The ancient Earth, [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], could not be claimed; she was left to all three, each according to their capabilities, which explains why Poseidon was the \"earth-shaker\" (the god of earthquakes) and Hades claimed the humans who died (see also [[Penthus]]).\n\nGaia resented the way Zeus had treated the Titans, because they were her children. Soon after taking the throne as king of the gods, Zeus had to fight some of Gaia's other children, the [[monster]]s [[Typhon]] and [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]]. He vanquished Typhon and trapped him under [[Mount Etna]], but left Echidna and her children alive.\n\n===Conflicts with humans===\n<!-- Since Greek mythology, as far as I understand, is essentially a loose collection of stories told by several groups in Ancient Greece where none can be considered the \"official canon\", this should really be prefaced with \"In the writings of (Greek author)...\" or \"In (work)...\", and several of the sentences describe details that probably vary by telling. -->\nWhen Zeus was atop Mount Olympus he was appalled by human sacrifice and other signs of human decadence. He decided to wipe out mankind and flooded the world with the help of his brother [[Poseidon]].

Some also include [[Eileithyia]], [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], [[Enyo]] and [[Angelos (Greek mythology)|Angelos]] as their daughters. In the section of the Iliad known to scholars as the [[Deception of Zeus]], the two of them are described as having begun their sexual relationship without their parents knowing about it.<ref>Iliad, Book 14, line 294</ref> The conquests of Zeus among [[nymph]]s and the mythic mortal progenitors of [[Greeks|Hellenic]] dynasties are famous.

For a time, a [[nymph]] named [[Echo (mythology)|Echo]] had the job of distracting Hera from his affairs by talking incessantly, and when Hera discovered the deception, she cursed Echo to repeat the words of others.\n\n=== Transformation of Zeus ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Love interest\n!Disguises\n|-\n|[[Aegina (mythology)|Aegina]]\n|an eagle or a flame of fire\n|-\n|[[Alcmene]]\n|[[Amphitryon]]\n|-\n|[[Antiope of Thebes|Antiope]]\n|a [[satyr]]\n|-\n|[[Asopis]]\n|a flame of fire\n|-\n|[[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]]\n|Artemis\n|-\n|[[Cassiopeia (wife of Phoenix)|Cassiopeia]]\n|[[Phoenix of Phoenicia|Phoenix]]\n|-\n|[[Dana\u00eb|Danae]]\n|shower of gold\n|-\n|[[Europa (consort of Zeus)|Europa]]\n|a bull\n|-\n|[[Eurymedousa|Eurymedusa]]\n|ant\n|-\n|[[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]]\n|an eagle\n|-\n|Imandra\n|a shower\n|-\n|[[Lamia]]\n|a lapwing\n|-\n|[[Leda (mythology)|Leda]]\n|a swan and a star\n|-\n|[[Manthea]]\n|a bear\n|-\n|Mnemosyne\n|a shepherd\n|-\n|[[Nemesis]]\n|a goose\n|-\n|[[Persephone]]\n|a serpent\n|-\n|[[Semele]]\n|a fire\n|-\n|[[Thalia (nymph)|Thalia]]\n|a vulture\n|}\n\n===Consorts and offspring===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+<big>Comparative table of Zeus' family</big>\n!Divine Lovers\n!Offspring\n!Divine Lovers\n!Offspring\n!Mortal Consort\n!Offspring\n|-\n|[[Aega (goddess)|Aega]] or\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\u2022 [[Aegipan]]<ref>[[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 155</ref>\n| rowspan=\"21\" |[[Themis]]\n|\u2022 [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]]\n|Alcmene\n|\u2022 [[Heracles]]\n|-\n|Aix or\n|\u2022 [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]]\n|Anaxithea\n|\u2022 [[Olenus]]<ref>[[Stephanus of Byzantium]], s. v.

Their quadrennial [[festival]] featured the famous Games. There was also an altar to Zeus made not of stone, but of ash, from the accumulated remains of many centuries' worth of animals sacrificed there.\n\nOutside of the major inter-[[polis]] sanctuaries, there were no modes of worshipping Zeus precisely shared across the Greek world. Most of the titles listed below, for instance, could be found at any number of [[Greek temple]]s from [[Asia Minor]] to [[Sicily]]. Certain modes of ritual were held in common as well: sacrificing a white animal over a raised altar, for instance.\n\n====Zeus Velchanos====\n\nWith one exception, Greeks were unanimous in recognizing the birthplace of Zeus as Crete. Minoan culture contributed many essentials of ancient Greek religion: \"by a hundred channels the old civilization emptied itself into the new\", Will Durant observed,<ref>Durant, ''The Life of Greece'' (''The Story of Civilization'' Part II, New York: Simon & Schuster) 1939:23.</ref> and Cretan Zeus retained his youthful Minoan features. The local child of the Great Mother, \"a small and inferior deity who took the roles of son and consort\",<ref>Rodney Castleden, ''Minoans: Life in Bronze-Age Crete'', \"The Minoan belief-system\" (Routledge) 1990:125</ref> whose Minoan name the Greeks Hellenized as Velchanos, was in time assumed as an [[epithet]] by Zeus, as transpired at many other sites, and he came to be venerated in Crete as '''Zeus Velchanos''' (\"boy-Zeus\"), often simply the ''[[Kouros]]''.\n\nIn [[Crete]], Zeus was worshipped at a number of caves at [[Knossos]], [[Mount Ida, Crete|Ida]] and [[Palaikastro]]. In the Hellenistic period a small sanctuary dedicated to Zeus Velchanos was founded at the [[Hagia Triada]] site of a long-ruined Minoan palace. Broadly contemporary coins from [[Phaistos]] show the form under which he was worshiped: a youth sits among the branches of a tree, with a cockerel on his knees.<ref>Pointed out by Bernard Clive Dietrich, ''The Origins of Greek Religion'' (de Gruyter) 1973:15.</ref> On other Cretan coins Velchanos is represented as an eagle and in association with a goddess celebrating a mystic marriage.<ref>A.B. Cook, ''Zeus'' Cambridge University Press, 1914, I, figs 397, 398.</ref> Inscriptions at [[Gortyn]] and Lyttos record a ''Velchania'' festival, showing that Velchanios was still widely venerated in Hellenistic Crete.<ref>Dietrich 1973, noting [[Martin P. Nilsson]], ''Minoan-Mycenaean Religion, and Its Survival in Greek Religion'' 1950:551 and notes.</ref>\n\nThe stories of [[Minos]] and [[Epimenides]] suggest that these caves were once used for [[Incubation (ritual)|incubatory]] divination by kings and priests. The dramatic setting of [[Plato]]'s ''Laws'' is along the pilgrimage-route to one such site, emphasizing archaic Cretan knowledge. On Crete, Zeus was represented in art as a long-haired youth rather than a mature adult and hymned as ''ho megas kouros'', \"the great youth\". Ivory statuettes of the \"Divine Boy\" were unearthed near the [[Labyrinth]] at [[Knossos]] by [[Sir Arthur Evans]].<ref>\"Professor [[Stylianos Alexiou]] reminds us that there were other divine boys who survived from the religion of the pre-Hellenic period \u2014 [[Linos]], [[Ploutos]] and [[Dionysos]] \u2014 so not all the young male deities we see depicted in Minoan works of art are necessarily Velchanos\" (Castleden 1990:125</ref> With the [[Kouretes]], a band of ecstatic armed dancers, he presided over the rigorous military-athletic training and secret rites of the Cretan ''[[paideia]]''.\n\nThe myth of the death of Cretan Zeus, localised in numerous mountain sites though only mentioned in a comparatively late source, [[Callimachus]],<ref>Richard Wyatt Hutchinson, ''Prehistoric Crete'', (Harmondsworth: Penguin) 1968:204, mentions that there is no classical reference to the death of Zeus (noted by Dietrich 1973:16 note 78).</ref> together with the assertion of [[Antoninus Liberalis]] that a fire shone forth annually from the birth-cave the infant shared with a [[Bees (mythology)|mythic swarm of bees]], suggests that Velchanos had been an annual vegetative spirit.<ref>\"This annually reborn god of vegetation also experienced the other parts of the vegetation cycle: holy marriage and annual death when he was thought to disappear from the earth\" (Dietrich 1973:15).</ref>\nThe Hellenistic writer [[Euhemerus]] apparently proposed a theory that Zeus had actually been a great king of [[Crete]] and that posthumously, his glory had slowly turned him into a deity. The works of Euhemerus himself have not survived, but Christian [[patristic]] writers took up the suggestion.\n\n====Zeus Lykaios====\n{{details|Lykaia}}\n\n[[File:Stater Zeus Lampsacus CdM.jpg|thumb|[[Laurel wreath|Laurel-wreathed]] head of Zeus on a gold [[stater]], [[Lampsacus]], c 360\u2013340 BC ([[Cabinet des M\u00e9dailles]]).]]\nThe epithet '''Zeus Lykaios''' (\"wolf-Zeus\") is assumed by Zeus only in connection with the archaic festival of the [[Lykaia]] on the slopes of [[Lycaeus|Mount Lykaion]] (\"Wolf Mountain\"), the tallest peak in rustic [[Arcadia]]; Zeus had only a formal connection<ref>In the founding myth of [[Lycaon (mythology)|Lycaon]]'s banquet for the gods that included the flesh of a human sacrifice, perhaps one of his sons, [[Nyctimus]] or [[Arcas]].

Whoever ate the human flesh was said to turn into a wolf, and could only regain human form if he did not eat again of human flesh until the next nine-year cycle had ended. There were games associated with the Lykaia, removed in the fourth century to the first urbanization of Arcadia, [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopolis]]; there the major temple was dedicated to Zeus Lykaios.\n\nThere is, however, the crucial detail that ''Lykaios'' or ''Lykeios'' (epithets of Zeus and Apollo) may derive from [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]] *{{lang|grc|\u03bb\u03cd\u03ba\u03b7}}, \"light\", a noun still attested in compounds such as {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cd\u03ba\u03b7}}, \"twilight\", {{lang|grc|\u03bb\u03c5\u03ba\u03ac\u03b2\u03b1\u03c2}}, \"year\" (lit. \"light's course\") etc. This, Cook argues, brings indeed much new 'light' to the matter as [[Achaeus of Eretria|Achaeus]], the contemporary tragedian of [[Sophocles]], spoke of Zeus Lykaios as \"starry-eyed\", and this Zeus Lykaios may just be the Arcadian Zeus, son of Aether, described by [[Cicero]]. Again under this new signification may be seen [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]' descriptions of Lykosoura being 'the first city that ever the sun beheld', and of the altar of Zeus, at the summit of Mount Lykaion, before which stood two columns bearing gilded eagles and 'facing the sun-rise'. Further Cook sees only the tale of Zeus' sacred precinct at Mount Lykaion allowing no shadows referring to Zeus as 'god of light' (Lykaios).<ref>A. B. Cook ('''1914'''), ''Zeus: A Study in Ancient Religion'', Vol. I, p.63, Cambridge University Press</ref>[[File:Statue of Zeus.jpg|thumb|A statue of Zeus in a drawing.]]\n\n====Additional cults of Zeus====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\nAlthough etymology indicates that Zeus was originally a sky god, many Greek cities honored a local Zeus who lived underground. Athenians and Sicilians honored '''Zeus Meilichios''' (\"kindly\" or \"honeyed\") while other cities had '''Zeus Chthonios''' (\"earthy\"), '''Zeus Katachthonios''' (\"under-the-earth\") and '''Zeus Plousios''' (\"wealth-bringing\"). These deities might be represented as snakes or in human form in visual art, or, for emphasis as both together in one image. They also received offerings of black animal victims sacrificed into sunken pits, as did [[chthonic]] deities like [[Persephone]] and [[Demeter]], and also the [[hero]]es at their tombs. Olympian gods, by contrast, usually received white victims sacrificed upon raised altars.\n\nIn some cases, cities were not entirely sure whether the ''daimon'' to whom they sacrificed was a hero or an underground Zeus. Thus the shrine at Lebadaea in [[Boeotia]] might belong to the hero [[Trophonius]] or to '''Zeus Trephonius''' (\"the nurturing\"), depending on whether you believe [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], or [[Strabo]]. The hero [[Amphiaraus]] was honored as '''Zeus Amphiaraus''' at Oropus outside of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], and the Spartans even had a shrine to '''Zeus Agamemnon'''. Ancient [[Molossians|Molossian]] kings sacrificed to '''[[Zeus Areius]]'''. [[Strabo]] mention that at [[Tralles]] there was the '''Zeus Larisaeus'''.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239%3Abook%3D14%3Achapter%3D1%3Asection%3D42 Strabo, Geography,  book 14, chapter 1.42]</ref>\n\n===Non-panhellenic cults===\n[[File:Museo Barracco - Giove Ammone 1010637.JPG|thumb|Roman cast [[terracotta]] of ram-horned ''Jupiter Ammon'', 1st century AD ([[Museo Barracco]], Rome).]]\n\nIn addition to the Panhellenic titles and conceptions listed above, local cults maintained their own idiosyncratic ideas about the king of gods and men.  With the epithet '''Zeus [[Aetnaeus]]''' he was worshiped on [[Mount Etna|Mount Aetna]], where there was a statue of him, and a local festival called the Aetnaea in his honor.<ref>Schol. ''ad Pind. Ol.'' vi. 162</ref> Other examples are listed below. As '''Zeus Aeneius''' or '''Zeus Aenesius''', he was worshiped in the island of [[Cephalonia]], where he had a temple on [[Mount Ainos|Mount Aenos]].<ref>Hesiod, according to a scholium on Apollonius of Rhodes. ''Argonautika'', ii. 297</ref>\n\n===Oracles of Zeus===\nAlthough most oracle sites were usually dedicated to [[Apollo]], the heroes, or various goddesses like [[Themis]], a few oracular sites were dedicated to Zeus. In addition, some foreign oracles, such as [[Ba\u02bfal]]'s at [[Heliopolis (Syria)|Heliopolis]], were [[interpretatio graeca|associated]] with Zeus in Greek or [[Jupiter]] in Latin.\n\n====The Oracle at Dodona====\n\nThe cult of Zeus at [[Dodona]] in [[Epirus]], where there is evidence of religious activity from the second millennium BC onward, centered on a sacred oak. When the ''[[Odyssey]]'' was composed (circa 750 BC), divination was done there by barefoot priests called ''Selloi'', who lay on the ground and observed the rustling of the leaves and branches.<ref>''Odyssey'' 14.326-7</ref> By the time [[Herodotus]] wrote about Dodona, female priestesses called [[peleiades]] (\"doves\") had replaced the male priests.\n\nZeus' consort at Dodona was not [[Hera]], but the goddess [[Dione (Titaness/Oceanid)|Dione]] \u2014 whose name is a feminine form of \"Zeus\". Her status as a [[Titan (mythology)|titaness]] suggests to some that she may have been a more powerful pre-Hellenic deity, and perhaps the original occupant of the oracle.\n\n==== The Oracle at Siwa ====\nThe [[oracle of Ammon]] at the [[Siwa Oasis]] in the Western Desert of [[Egypt]] did not lie within the bounds of the Greek world before [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s day, but it already loomed large in the Greek mind during the archaic era: [[Herodotus]] mentions consultations with Zeus Ammon in his account of the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian War]]. Zeus Ammon was especially favored at [[Sparta]], where a temple to him existed by the time of the [[Peloponnesian War]].<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 3.18.</ref>\n\nAfter Alexander made a trek into the desert to consult the oracle at Siwa, the figure arose in the Hellenistic imagination of a [[Libyan Sibyl]].\n\n==Gnostic literature==\n[[Pistis Sophia]], a piece belonging to [[Gnosticism]] shown to date back at least to the 4th century AD,<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Birger A.

Four years later, in 1847, his father died, leaving his mother on a meager pension. In 1858, the Zolas moved to Paris, where \u00c9mile's childhood friend [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]] soon joined him. Zola started to write in the [[Romanticism|romantic]] style. His widowed mother had planned a law career for \u00c9mile, but he failed his [[Baccalaur\u00e9at]] examination.<ref name=\"nom\">[[\u00c9ditions Larousse|Larousse]], [http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/personnage/Zola/150676  \n\nBefore his breakthrough as a writer, Zola worked for minimal pay as a clerk in a shipping firm and then in the sales department for the publisher ([[Louis Christophe Fran\u00e7ois Hachette|Hachette]]). He also wrote literary and art reviews for newspapers. As a political journalist, Zola did not hide his dislike of [[Napoleon III]], who had successfully run for the office of president under the constitution of the [[French Second Republic]], only to misuse this position as a springboard for the [[French coup d'\u00e9tat of 1851|coup d'\u00e9tat that made him emperor]].\n\n==Later life==\nIn 1862, Zola was naturalized as a French citizen.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} In 1865, he met \u00c9l\u00e9onore-Alexandrine Meley, who called herself Gabrielle, a seamstress, who became his mistress.<ref name=\"nom\"/> They married on 31 May 1870.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Frederick|title=Zola: A Life|publisher=Farrar Straus Giroux|isbn=0374297428|page=195}}</ref> She stayed with him all his life and was instrumental in promoting his work. The marriage remained childless. Alexandrine Zola had a child before she met Zola that she had given up, because she was unable to take care of it. When she confessed this to Zola after their marriage, they went looking for the girl, but she had died a short time after birth.\n\nIn 1888, he was given a camera, but he only began to use it in 1895 and obtained a near professional level of expertise.<ref>{{Cite news|title=IN LATER YEARS, ZOLA SAW WORLD THROUGH A CAMERA|last=August|first=Marilyn|date=14 December 2000|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|page=F-8|via=ProQuest}}</ref> Also in 1888, Alexandrine hired Jeanne Rozerot, a seamstress who was to live with them in their home in [[M\u00e9dan]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Frederick|title=Zola: A Life|publisher=Farrar Straus Giroux|isbn=0374297428|pages=614, 615}}</ref> Zola fell in love with Jeanne and fathered two children with her: Denise in 1889 and Jacques in 1891.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Frederick|title=Zola: A Life|publisher=Farrar Straus Giroux|isbn=0374297428|pages=646\u2013648}}</ref> After Jeanne left M\u00e9dan for Paris, Zola continued to support and visit her and their children.

Among his early books was ''Contes \u00e0 Ninon'', published in 1864.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> With the publication of his sordid autobiographical novel ''La Confession de Claude'' (1865) attracting police attention, Hachette fired Zola. His novel ''Les Myst\u00e8res de Marseille'' appeared as a serial in 1867. He was also an aggressive critic, his articles on literature and art appearing in [[Hippolyte de Villemessant|Villemessant's]] journal ''L'\u00c9v\u00e9nement''.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> After his first major novel, ''[[Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin]]'' (1867), Zola started the series called [[Les Rougon-Macquart]].\n\nIn Paris, Zola maintained his friendship with [[C\u00e9zanne]], who painted a portrait of him with another friend from Aix-en-Provence, writer [[Paul Alexis]], entitled ''Paul Alexis Reading to Zola''.\n\n===Literary output===\n[[Image:Paul C\u00e9zanne - Paul Alexis L\u00ea um Manuscrito a Zola.jpg|thumb|right|[[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], ''[[Paul Alexis]] Reading to \u00c9mile Zola'', 1869\u20131870, [[S\u00e3o Paulo Museum of Art]]]]\nMore than half of Zola's novels were part of a set of 20 collectively known as [[Les Rougon-Macquart]], about a family under the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]]. Unlike [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]], who in the midst of his literary career resynthesized his work into ''[[La Com\u00e9die Humaine]]'', Zola from the start, at the age of 28, had thought of the complete layout of the series.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Set in France's Second Empire, in the context of [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris|Baron Haussman's changing Paris]], the series traces the \"environmental\" influences of violence, alcohol, and prostitution which became more prevalent during the second wave of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The series examines two branches of a family\u2014the respectable (that is, legitimate) Rougons and the disreputable (illegitimate) Macquarts\u2014for five generations.\n\nAs he described his plans for the series, \"I want to portray, at the outset of a century of liberty and truth, a family that cannot restrain itself in its rush to possess all the good things that progress is making available and is derailed by its own momentum, the fatal convulsions that accompany the birth of a new world.\"{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nAlthough Zola and C\u00e9zanne were friends from childhood, they experienced a falling out later in life over Zola's fictionalised depiction of C\u00e9zanne and the [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] life of painters in Zola's novel ''[[L'\u0152uvre]]'' (''The Masterpiece'', 1886).\n\nFrom 1877, with the publication of ''[[L'Assommoir]]'', \u00c9mile Zola became wealthy; he was better paid than [[Victor Hugo]], for example.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Because ''L'Assommoir'' was such a success, Zola was able to renegotiate his contract with his publisher Georges Charpentier to receive more than 14 percent royalties and the exclusive rights to serial publication in the press.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Books : a living history|last=Martyn|first=Lyons|date=2011|publisher=J.

''[[Germinal (novel)|Germinal]]'' in 1885, then the three \"cities\"\u2014''Lourdes'' (1894), ''Rome'' (1896), and ''Paris'' (1897), further established Zola as a successful author.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} However, despite being nominated several times, Zola was never elected to the {{lang|fr|[[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]]}}.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nZola's output also included novels on population (''F\u00e9condit\u00e9'') and work (''Travail''), a volume of plays, and several volumes of criticism. He wrote every day for around 30 years, and took as his motto {{lang|la|Nulla dies sine linea}} (\"not a day without a line\").\n\nThe self-proclaimed leader of French naturalism, Zola's works inspired operas such as those of [[Gustave Charpentier]], notably ''[[Louise (opera)|Louise]]'' in the 1890s. His works, inspired by the concepts of [[heredity]] ([[Claude Bernard]]), social [[Manicheanism]], and idealistic socialism, resonate with those of [[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]], [[\u00c9douard Manet|Manet]], and subsequently [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n \nHe is considered to be a significant influence on those writers that are credited with the creation of the so-called [[new journalism]]; Wolfe, Capote, Thompson, Mailer, Didion, Talese and others.\n[[Tom Wolfe]] wrote that his goal in writing fiction was to document contemporary society in the tradition of John Steinbeck, Charles Dickens, and \u00c9mile Zola.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Dreyfus affair==\n{{Main|Dreyfus affair|J'accuse}}\n[[File:J\u2019accuse.jpg|thumb|Front page cover of the newspaper ''L'Aurore'' for Thursday 13 January 1898, with the open letter ''[[J'Accuse\u2026!]]'', written by \u00c9mile Zola about the [[Dreyfus affair]].

In September 1894, French intelligence found information about someone giving the German Embassy military secrets. Anti-semitism caused senior officers to suspect Dreyfus, though there was no direct evidence of any wrongdoing. Dreyfus was court-martialed, convicted of treason, and sent to [[Devil's Island]] in French Guiana.\n\nLt. Col. [[Georges Picquart]] came across evidence that implicated another officer, [[Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy]], and informed his superiors. Rather than move to clear Dreyfus, the decision was made to protect Esterhazy and ensure the original verdict was not overturned. Major [[Hubert-Joseph Henry]] forged documents that made it seem as if Dreyfus were guilty, while Picquart was reassigned to duty in Africa. However, Picquart's findings were communicated by his lawyer to the Senator [[Auguste Scheurer-Kestner]], who took up the case, at first discreetly and then increasingly publicly. Meanwhile, further evidence was brought forward by Dreyfus's family and Esterhazy's estranged family and creditors. Under pressure, the general staff arranged for a closed court-martial to be held on 10\u201311 January 1898, at which Esterhazy was tried ''in camera'' and acquitted. Picquart was detained on charges of violation of professional secrecy.\n\nIn response Zola risked his career and more, and on 13 January 1898 published ''[[J'Accuse\u2026!]]''<ref>[//en.wikisource.org/wiki/J'accuse...!?match=fr J'accuse letter] at French [[wikisource]]</ref> on the front page of the Paris daily ''[[L'Aurore]]''. The newspaper was run by Ernest Vaughan and [[Georges Clemenceau]], who decided that the controversial story would be in the form of an [[open letter]] to the President, [[F\u00e9lix Faure]]. Zola's ''J'Accuse...!'' accused the highest levels of the French Army of obstruction of justice and [[antisemitism]] by having wrongfully convicted Alfred Dreyfus to life imprisonment on Devil's Island. Zola's intention was that he be prosecuted for libel so that the new evidence in support of Dreyfus would be made public.<ref>{{cite web|title=Correspondence Between Emile Zola and Imprisoned Alfred Dreyfus|url=http://www.shapell.org/manuscript.aspx?170038|publisher=Shapell Manuscript Foundation}}</ref> The case, known as the Dreyfus affair, divided France deeply between the reactionary army and Catholic church on one hand, and the more liberal commercial society on the other. The ramifications continued for many years; on the 100th anniversary of Zola's article, France's [[Roman Catholic]] daily paper, ''[[La Croix]]'', apologized for its [[antisemitic]] editorials during the Dreyfus affair.<ref>{{cite news|title=World News Briefs; French Paper Apologizes For Slurs on Dreyfus|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/13/world/world-news-briefs-french-paper-apologizes-for-slurs-on-dreyfus.html|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=13 January 1998|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref> As Zola was a leading French thinker and public figure, his letter formed a major turning point in the affair.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nZola was brought to trial for criminal libel on 7 February 1898, and was convicted on 23 February and removed from the [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur|Legion of Honor]]. The first judgment was overturned in April on a technicality, but a new suit was pressed against Zola, which opened on 18 July. At his lawyer's advice, Zola fled to England rather than wait for the end of the trial (at which he was again convicted). Without even having had the time to pack a few clothes, he arrived at [[London Victoria station|Victoria Station]] on 19 July, the start of a brief and unhappy residence in London, living at [[Upper Norwood]] from October 1898 to June 1899.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nIn France, the furious divisions over the Dreyfus affair continued. The fact of Major Henry's forgery was discovered and admitted to in August 1898, and the Government referred Dreyfus's original court-martial to the Supreme Court for review the following month, over the objections of the General Staff. Eight months later, on 3 June 1899, the Supreme Court annulled the original verdict and ordered a new military court-martial. The same month Zola returned from his exile in England. Still the anti-Dreyfusards would not give up, and on 8 September 1899 Dreyfus was again convicted. Dreyfus applied for a retrial, but the government countered by offering Dreyfus a pardon (rather than exoneration), which would allow him to go free, provided that he admit to being guilty. Although he was clearly not guilty, he chose to accept the pardon. Later the same month, despite Zola's condemnation, an amnesty bill was passed, covering \"all criminal acts or misdemeanours related to the Dreyfus affair or that have been included in a prosecution for one of these acts\", indemnifying Zola and Picquart, but also all those who had concocted evidence against Dreyfus. Dreyfus was finally completely exonerated by the Supreme Court in 1906.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZqpCrG3qw0C&lpg=PA117&dq=In%201906,%20Dreyfus%20was%20completely%20exonerated%20by%20the%20Supreme%20Court.&pg=PA117#v=onepage&q=In%201906,%20Dreyfus%20was%20completely%20exonerated%20by%20the%20Supreme%20Court.&f=false|title=The New Jewish Encyclopedia|last=Bridger|first=David|last2=Wolk|first2=Samuel|date=1 January 1976|publisher=Behrman House, Inc|isbn=978-0874411201|pages=111|language=en}}</ref>\n  \nZola said of the affair, \"The truth is on the march, and nothing shall stop it.\"<ref>Wikisource, [[s:J'accuse...!|I Accuse....!

They are the story of a family principally between the years 1851 and 1871. These 20 novels contain over 300 major characters, who descend from the two family lines of the Rougons and Macquarts and who are related. In Zola's words, which are the subtitle of the Rougon-Macquart series, they are ''\"L'Histoire naturelle et sociale d'une famille sous le Second Empire\"(\"The natural and social history of a family under the Second Empire\").<ref name=\"Daily Telegraph 5 December 2015\">{{cite news|last=Cummins|first=Anthony|title=How \u00c9mile Zola made novels out of gutter voices and ultra-violence|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/how-emile-zola-made-novels-out-of-gutter-voices-and-ultra-violenc/|date=5 December 2015|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|accessdate=3 November 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\">{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Rougon-Macquart-cycle|title=Rougon-Macquart cycle: Work by Zola|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]|publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.]]|accessdate=3 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nMost of the Rougon-Macquart novels were written during the [[French Third Republic]]. To an extent, attitudes and value judgments may have been superimposed on that picture with the wisdom of hindsight. The d\u00e9b\u00e2cle in which the reign of [[Napoleon III of France]] culminated may have imparted a note of decadence to certain of the novels about France in the years before that disastrous defeat.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Nowhere is the doom laden image of the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] so clearly seen as in ''[[Nana (novel)|Nana]]'', which culminates in echoes of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (and hence by implication of the French defeat).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kdK-qPMBbAC&pg=PA135&dq=zola+nana+french+defeat&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi-s-7u69PlAhWnmOAKHf9gCNQQ6AEwAnoECAMQAg#v=onepage&q=zola%20nana%20french%20defeat&f=false|title=The Cambridge Companion to Zola|last=Nelson|first=Brian|date=15 February 2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139827270|language=en}}</ref> Even in novels dealing with earlier periods of Napoleon III's reign the picture of the Second Empire is sometimes overlaid with the imagery of catastrophe.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn the Rougon-Macquart novels, provincial life can seem to be overshadowed by Zola's preoccupation with the capital.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}.However, the following novels (see the individual titles in the Livre de poche series) scarcely touch on life in Paris: ''[[La Terre]]'' (peasant life in Beauce), ''[[Le R\u00eave (novel)|Le R\u00eave]]'' (an unnamed cathedral city), ''[[Germinal (novel)|Germinal]]'' (collieries in the north east of France), ''[[La Joie de vivre]]'' (the Atlantic coast), and the four novels set in and around Plassans (modelled on his childhood home, Aix-en-Provence), (''[[La Fortune des Rougon]]'', ''[[La Conqu\u00eate de Plassans]]'', ''[[La Faute de l'Abb\u00e9 Mouret]]'' and ''[[Le Docteur Pascal]]''){{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}. ''[[La D\u00e9b\u00e2cle]]'', the military novel is set for the most part in country districts of eastern France; its d\u00e9nouement takes place in the capital during the civil war leading to the suppression of the [[Paris Commune]]. Though Paris has its role in ''La B\u00eate humaine'' the most striking incidents (notably the train-crash) take place elsewhere. Even the Paris-centred novels tend to set some scenes outside, if not very far from, the capital. In the political novel Son Excellence Eugene Rougon, the eponymous minister's interventions on behalf of his soi-disant friends, have their consequences elsewhere, and the reader is witness to some of them. Even Nana, that most Parisian of Zola's characters, makes a brief and typically disastrous trip to the country. Perhaps Une Page d'Amour, set in Passy, has something to tell us about Zola's attitude to Paris: H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, the central character has fled to the suburbs, but from her window the city dominates the view, beautiful but somehow baleful.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PjclDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=zola+nana+french+defeat&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi-s-7u69PlAhWnmOAKHf9gCNQQ6AEwAXoECAAQAg#v=onepage&q=zola%20nana%20french%20defeat&f=false|title=La Debacle: (reissue)|last=Zola|first=Emile|date=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780198801894|location=|pages=vii-xxviii|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Quasi-scientific purpose==\nIn ''Le Roman exp\u00e9rimental'' and ''Les Romanciers naturalistes,'' Zola expounded the purposes of the \"naturalist\" novel.

He was a major figure in the political liberalization of France and in the exoneration of the falsely accused and convicted army officer [[Alfred Dreyfus]], which is encapsulated in the renowned newspaper headline ''[[J'Accuse\u2026!]]'' Zola was nominated for the first and second [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1901 and 1902.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/literature/nomination.php?string=1901&action=simplesearch&submit.x=20&submit.y=8&submit=submit|title=Nomination Database \u2013 Literature \u2013 1901|publisher=Nobel Foundation|accessdate=7 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/literature/nomination.php?string=1902&action=simplesearch&submit.x=11&submit.y=4&submit=submit|title=Nomination Database \u2013 Literature \u2013 1902|publisher=Nobel Foundation|accessdate=7 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nZola was born in Paris in 1840 to [[Fran\u00e7ois Zola]] (originally Francesco Zola), and his wife \u00c9milie Aubert.

Four years later, in 1847, his father died, leaving his mother on a meager pension. In 1858, the Zolas moved to Paris, where \u00c9mile's childhood friend [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]] soon joined him. Zola started to write in the [[Romanticism|romantic]] style. His widowed mother had planned a law career for \u00c9mile, but he failed his [[Baccalaur\u00e9at]] examination.<ref name=\"nom\">[[\u00c9ditions Larousse|Larousse]], [http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/personnage/Zola/150676 ''\u00c9mile Zola'']</ref> Emile Zola spent his childhood in Aix-en- Provence. When Zola was seven years old his father died with his project uncompleted, leaving the family with money problems. Zola's mother was largely dependent on a tiny pension. \n\nBefore his breakthrough as a writer, Zola worked for minimal pay as a clerk in a shipping firm and then in the sales department for the publisher ([[Louis Christophe Fran\u00e7ois Hachette|Hachette]]). He also wrote literary and art reviews for newspapers. As a political journalist, Zola did not hide his dislike of [[Napoleon III]], who had successfully run for the office of president under the constitution of the [[French Second Republic]], only to misuse this position as a springboard for the [[French coup d'\u00e9tat of 1851|coup d'\u00e9tat that made him emperor]].\n\n==Later life==\nIn 1862, Zola was naturalized as a French citizen.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} In 1865, he met \u00c9l\u00e9onore-Alexandrine Meley, who called herself Gabrielle, a seamstress, who became his mistress.<ref name=\"nom\"/> They married on 31 May 1870.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Frederick|title=Zola: A Life|publisher=Farrar Straus Giroux|isbn=0374297428|page=195}}</ref> She stayed with him all his life and was instrumental in promoting his work. The marriage remained childless. Alexandrine Zola had a child before she met Zola that she had given up, because she was unable to take care of it. When she confessed this to Zola after their marriage, they went looking for the girl, but she had died a short time after birth.\n\nIn 1888, he was given a camera, but he only began to use it in 1895 and obtained a near professional level of expertise.<ref>{{Cite news|title=IN LATER YEARS, ZOLA SAW WORLD THROUGH A CAMERA|last=August|first=Marilyn|date=14 December 2000|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|page=F-8|via=ProQuest}}</ref> Also in 1888, Alexandrine hired Jeanne Rozerot, a seamstress who was to live with them in their home in [[M\u00e9dan]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Frederick|title=Zola: A Life|publisher=Farrar Straus Giroux|isbn=0374297428|pages=614, 615}}</ref> Zola fell in love with Jeanne and fathered two children with her: Denise in 1889 and Jacques in 1891.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Frederick|title=Zola: A Life|publisher=Farrar Straus Giroux|isbn=0374297428|pages=646\u2013648}}</ref> After Jeanne left M\u00e9dan for Paris, Zola continued to support and visit her and their children. In November 1891 Alexandrine discovered the affair, which brought the marriage to the brink of divorce.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The discord was partially healed, which allowed Zola to take an increasingly active role in the lives of the children. Eugene Ionesco's sister lived probably in Medan, a children's home founded by Zola. <ref>Ionesco, Eugene, Present Past, Past Present {{isbn|0-394-17783-5}}</ref> After Zola's death, the children were given his name as their lawful surname.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Frederick|title=Zola: A Life|publisher=Farrar Straus Giroux|isbn=0374297428|page=802}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:\u00c9mile Zola by Carjat.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Zola early in his career]]\n\nDuring his early years, Zola wrote numerous short stories and essays, four plays, and three novels. Among his early books was ''Contes \u00e0 Ninon'', published in 1864.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> With the publication of his sordid autobiographical novel ''La Confession de Claude'' (1865) attracting police attention, Hachette fired Zola. His novel ''Les Myst\u00e8res de Marseille'' appeared as a serial in 1867. He was also an aggressive critic, his articles on literature and art appearing in [[Hippolyte de Villemessant|Villemessant's]] journal ''L'\u00c9v\u00e9nement''.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> After his first major novel, ''[[Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin]]'' (1867), Zola started the series called [[Les Rougon-Macquart]].\n\nIn Paris, Zola maintained his friendship with [[C\u00e9zanne]], who painted a portrait of him with another friend from Aix-en-Provence, writer [[Paul Alexis]], entitled ''Paul Alexis Reading to Zola''.\n\n===Literary output===\n[[Image:Paul C\u00e9zanne - Paul Alexis L\u00ea um Manuscrito a Zola.jpg|thumb|right|[[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], ''[[Paul Alexis]] Reading to \u00c9mile Zola'', 1869\u20131870, [[S\u00e3o Paulo Museum of Art]]]]\nMore than half of Zola's novels were part of a set of 20 collectively known as [[Les Rougon-Macquart]], about a family under the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]]. Unlike [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]], who in the midst of his literary career resynthesized his work into ''[[La Com\u00e9die Humaine]]'', Zola from the start, at the age of 28, had thought of the complete layout of the series.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Set in France's Second Empire, in the context of [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris|Baron Haussman's changing Paris]], the series traces the \"environmental\" influences of violence, alcohol, and prostitution which became more prevalent during the second wave of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The series examines two branches of a family\u2014the respectable (that is, legitimate) Rougons and the disreputable (illegitimate) Macquarts\u2014for five generations.\n\nAs he described his plans for the series, \"I want to portray, at the outset of a century of liberty and truth, a family that cannot restrain itself in its rush to possess all the good things that progress is making available and is derailed by its own momentum, the fatal convulsions that accompany the birth of a new world.\"{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nAlthough Zola and C\u00e9zanne were friends from childhood, they experienced a falling out later in life over Zola's fictionalised depiction of C\u00e9zanne and the [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] life of painters in Zola's novel ''[[L'\u0152uvre]]'' (''The Masterpiece'', 1886).\n\nFrom 1877, with the publication of ''[[L'Assommoir]]'', \u00c9mile Zola became wealthy; he was better paid than [[Victor Hugo]], for example.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Because ''L'Assommoir'' was such a success, Zola was able to renegotiate his contract with his publisher Georges Charpentier to receive more than 14 percent royalties and the exclusive rights to serial publication in the press.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Books : a living history|last=Martyn|first=Lyons|date=2011|publisher=J.

''[[Germinal (novel)|Germinal]]'' in 1885, then the three \"cities\"\u2014''Lourdes'' (1894), ''Rome'' (1896), and ''Paris'' (1897), further established Zola as a successful author.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} However, despite being nominated several times, Zola was never elected to the {{lang|fr|[[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]]}}.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nZola's output also included novels on population (''F\u00e9condit\u00e9'') and work (''Travail''), a volume of plays, and several volumes of criticism. He wrote every day for around 30 years, and took as his motto {{lang|la|Nulla dies sine linea}} (\"not a day without a line\").\n\nThe self-proclaimed leader of French naturalism, Zola's works inspired operas such as those of [[Gustave Charpentier]], notably ''[[Louise (opera)|Louise]]'' in the 1890s. His works, inspired by the concepts of [[heredity]] ([[Claude Bernard]]), social [[Manicheanism]], and idealistic socialism, resonate with those of [[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]], [[\u00c9douard Manet|Manet]], and subsequently [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n \nHe is considered to be a significant influence on those writers that are credited with the creation of the so-called [[new journalism]]; Wolfe, Capote, Thompson, Mailer, Didion, Talese and others.\n[[Tom Wolfe]] wrote that his goal in writing fiction was to document contemporary society in the tradition of John Steinbeck, Charles Dickens, and \u00c9mile Zola.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Dreyfus affair==\n{{Main|Dreyfus affair|J'accuse}}\n[[File:J\u2019accuse.jpg|thumb|Front page cover of the newspaper ''L'Aurore'' for Thursday 13 January 1898, with the open letter ''[[J'Accuse\u2026!]]'', written by \u00c9mile Zola about the [[Dreyfus affair]]. The headline reads \"I Accuse...! Letter to the President of the Republic\"\u2014Paris [[Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire du Juda\u00efsme|Museum of Jewish Art and History]]]]\n\nCaptain [[Alfred Dreyfus]] was a French-Jewish artillery officer in the French army. In September 1894, French intelligence found information about someone giving the German Embassy military secrets. Anti-semitism caused senior officers to suspect Dreyfus, though there was no direct evidence of any wrongdoing. Dreyfus was court-martialed, convicted of treason, and sent to [[Devil's Island]] in French Guiana.\n\nLt. Col. [[Georges Picquart]] came across evidence that implicated another officer, [[Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy]], and informed his superiors. Rather than move to clear Dreyfus, the decision was made to protect Esterhazy and ensure the original verdict was not overturned. Major [[Hubert-Joseph Henry]] forged documents that made it seem as if Dreyfus were guilty, while Picquart was reassigned to duty in Africa. However, Picquart's findings were communicated by his lawyer to the Senator [[Auguste Scheurer-Kestner]], who took up the case, at first discreetly and then increasingly publicly. Meanwhile, further evidence was brought forward by Dreyfus's family and Esterhazy's estranged family and creditors. Under pressure, the general staff arranged for a closed court-martial to be held on 10\u201311 January 1898, at which Esterhazy was tried ''in camera'' and acquitted. Picquart was detained on charges of violation of professional secrecy.\n\nIn response Zola risked his career and more, and on 13 January 1898 published ''[[J'Accuse\u2026!]]''<ref>[//en.wikisource.org/wiki/J'accuse...!?match=fr J'accuse letter] at French [[wikisource]]</ref> on the front page of the Paris daily ''[[L'Aurore]]''. The newspaper was run by Ernest Vaughan and [[Georges Clemenceau]], who decided that the controversial story would be in the form of an [[open letter]] to the President, [[F\u00e9lix Faure]]. Zola's ''J'Accuse...!'' accused the highest levels of the French Army of obstruction of justice and [[antisemitism]] by having wrongfully convicted Alfred Dreyfus to life imprisonment on Devil's Island.

The first judgment was overturned in April on a technicality, but a new suit was pressed against Zola, which opened on 18 July. At his lawyer's advice, Zola fled to England rather than wait for the end of the trial (at which he was again convicted). Without even having had the time to pack a few clothes, he arrived at [[London Victoria station|Victoria Station]] on 19 July, the start of a brief and unhappy residence in London, living at [[Upper Norwood]] from October 1898 to June 1899.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nIn France, the furious divisions over the Dreyfus affair continued. The fact of Major Henry's forgery was discovered and admitted to in August 1898, and the Government referred Dreyfus's original court-martial to the Supreme Court for review the following month, over the objections of the General Staff. Eight months later, on 3 June 1899, the Supreme Court annulled the original verdict and ordered a new military court-martial. The same month Zola returned from his exile in England. Still the anti-Dreyfusards would not give up, and on 8 September 1899 Dreyfus was again convicted. Dreyfus applied for a retrial, but the government countered by offering Dreyfus a pardon (rather than exoneration), which would allow him to go free, provided that he admit to being guilty. Although he was clearly not guilty, he chose to accept the pardon. Later the same month, despite Zola's condemnation, an amnesty bill was passed, covering \"all criminal acts or misdemeanours related to the Dreyfus affair or that have been included in a prosecution for one of these acts\", indemnifying Zola and Picquart, but also all those who had concocted evidence against Dreyfus. Dreyfus was finally completely exonerated by the Supreme Court in 1906.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZqpCrG3qw0C&lpg=PA117&dq=In%201906,%20Dreyfus%20was%20completely%20exonerated%20by%20the%20Supreme%20Court.&pg=PA117#v=onepage&q=In%201906,%20Dreyfus%20was%20completely%20exonerated%20by%20the%20Supreme%20Court.&f=false|title=The New Jewish Encyclopedia|last=Bridger|first=David|last2=Wolk|first2=Samuel|date=1 January 1976|publisher=Behrman House, Inc|isbn=978-0874411201|pages=111|language=en}}</ref>\n  \nZola said of the affair, \"The truth is on the march, and nothing shall stop it.\"<ref>Wikisource, [[s:J'accuse...!|I Accuse....!

These 20 novels contain over 300 major characters, who descend from the two family lines of the Rougons and Macquarts and who are related. In Zola's words, which are the subtitle of the Rougon-Macquart series, they are ''\"L'Histoire naturelle et sociale d'une famille sous le Second Empire\"(\"The natural and social history of a family under the Second Empire\").<ref name=\"Daily Telegraph 5 December 2015\">{{cite news|last=Cummins|first=Anthony|title=How \u00c9mile Zola made novels out of gutter voices and ultra-violence|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/how-emile-zola-made-novels-out-of-gutter-voices-and-ultra-violenc/|date=5 December 2015|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|accessdate=3 November 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\">{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Rougon-Macquart-cycle|title=Rougon-Macquart cycle: Work by Zola|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]|publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.]]|accessdate=3 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nMost of the Rougon-Macquart novels were written during the [[French Third Republic]]. To an extent, attitudes and value judgments may have been superimposed on that picture with the wisdom of hindsight.

''[[La D\u00e9b\u00e2cle]]'', the military novel is set for the most part in country districts of eastern France; its d\u00e9nouement takes place in the capital during the civil war leading to the suppression of the [[Paris Commune]]. Though Paris has its role in ''La B\u00eate humaine'' the most striking incidents (notably the train-crash) take place elsewhere. Even the Paris-centred novels tend to set some scenes outside, if not very far from, the capital. In the political novel Son Excellence Eugene Rougon, the eponymous minister's interventions on behalf of his soi-disant friends, have their consequences elsewhere, and the reader is witness to some of them. Even Nana, that most Parisian of Zola's characters, makes a brief and typically disastrous trip to the country. Perhaps Une Page d'Amour, set in Passy, has something to tell us about Zola's attitude to Paris: H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, the central character has fled to the suburbs, but from her window the city dominates the view, beautiful but somehow baleful.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PjclDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=zola+nana+french+defeat&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi-s-7u69PlAhWnmOAKHf9gCNQQ6AEwAXoECAAQAg#v=onepage&q=zola%20nana%20french%20defeat&f=false|title=La Debacle: (reissue)|last=Zola|first=Emile|date=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780198801894|location=|pages=vii-xxviii|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Quasi-scientific purpose==\nIn ''Le Roman exp\u00e9rimental'' and ''Les Romanciers naturalistes,'' Zola expounded the purposes of the \"naturalist\" novel.
