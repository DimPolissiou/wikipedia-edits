It was based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of prior album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" received positive reception, called \"impossibly catchy\" and \"classic pop\". It became Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States and stayed atop the chart for three weeks. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, which ranked her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The single fared well internationally, reaching number five in the United Kingdom, and peaking within the top-ten in Italy and Denmark. It attained a silver certification in the United Kingdom, and allowed Jam and Lewis to receive a [[Grammy]] nomination for [[Producer of the Year]]. The song was later included in two of Jackson's greatest hits collections, ''[[Number Ones (Janet Jackson album)|Number Ones]]'' and ''[[Icon: Number Ones]]''.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to clips from the movie, it features advanced technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. The video had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, being one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. Its accolades include \"Outstanding Music Video\" and \"Most Stylish Music Video\" at the [[VH1]] Fashion Awards. The song was performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]], the latter regarded as one of the leading performances of Jackson's career.\n\nA slightly modified version of the song appeared on Jackson's seventh [[album]] ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was considered to influence music videos from [[Britney Spears]], [[Jessica Simpson]] and [[Cassie (singer)|Cassie]]. The video was the first by director Joseph Kahn to feature Japanese themes and imagery, which he later used frequently following its popularity. Actress [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her debut appearances in the video, crediting Jackson for the experience and platform to star in the dance film ''[[Step Up (film)|Step Up]]''. [[Rihanna]]'s \"Watch n' Learn\" was likened to the song, and it was also covered by Japanese singer [[Hitomi Shimatani]] as \"Papillon\".\n\n==Background==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Jam & Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]]. She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of Sherman Klump, one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\"/>\n\nJackson stated that \"it really tells you about the movie and how it doesn't matter what is on the exterior, but the interior. His heart, his soul, that really matters to me. That's what I'm in love with, that's what matters to me the most, and it doesn't matter what other people say.\"<ref name=\"Making\" /> An [[Audio mastering|unmastered]] version [[internet leak|leaked]] and received airplay ahead of its scheduled release, followed by a positive response from critics and fans.

Jam recalled, \"He said, 'Now that you've seen the film, if you'd like to do a song for it, that'd be great.'\" Segal told Jackson she was an exceptional actress after becoming convinced she truly loved Murphy's character, leading Jackson to suggest writing an up-tempo love song rather than a ballad.<ref name=\"Bronson\" />\n\nThe song was based on a poem Jackson had written, discarded, then rediscovered.<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/jun/03/janet-jackson-10-of-the-best|title=Janet Jackson: 10 of the best|last=Cragg|first=Michael|website=[[The Guardian]]|date=June 3, 2015|access-date=February 7, 2020}}</ref> Jackson's original lyrics were kept intact, although its structure was altered. Jam stated that \"the lyrical idea for 'Doesn't Really Matter' is totally hers, but the music and melody was something I had done with one of our drum programmers, Alex Richburg. I thought of it as a slow melody, but we sped it up.\" Jackson wrote the remaining lyrics overnight. \"We ended up with two different choruses,\" said Jam. \"I wrote, 'Nutty, nutty, nutty, my love for you.' and she wrote 'Doesn't really matter.'\" \"The 'Doesn't really matter' chorus was better but she liked 'Nutty, nutty, nutty' and said we should put it at the end of the song.\"<ref name=\"Bronson\" /> Jackson presented three songs including \"Doesn't Really Matter\" and an early version of \"Feels So Right\", later included on Jackson's following album. Segal decided \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was a better fit and a \"summertime record.\" A slightly modified version was included on ''All for You'', featuring an alternate introduction and elements from the song's remix by [[Rockwilder]].<ref name=\"Bronson\" />\n\n==Composition==\nIn \"Doesn't Really Matter\", Jackson speaks of looking past physical appearance, choosing to love the person inside. Using a vocal [[falsetto]], Jackson assures \"[It] doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing, 'cause I'm in love with the inner being,\" considered a \"sweet song of unconditional love.\" Its theme also emphasizes self-acceptance and pride, opposing negativity. Jackson said \"It plays a major part in society, it seems today. Their image, what a woman is supposed to look like \u2013 all the things you read in the magazines about either being too thin or too this or too that, but it's really about feeling good yourself and accepting yourself. Self-acceptance, which is another story you see here in this film, is the most important thing as well as being happy with who you are.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.femail.com.au/jacksonii.htm |title=Janet Jackson \u2013 Nutty Professor II Interview |work=Femail.com.au |accessdate=February 2, 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe song is based on Jackson's character Denise's \"unconditional love\" for the obese but gentle Sherman. Jackson said, \"I loved this character so much because she didn't care about all the other things that people may have seen or saw and thought was wrong with Sherman. Those were the things she loved about him, and then on top of that she saw beyond that \u2013 how genuine of a man he is, how kind he is, a very good-hearted person and that's what she loves about him[...] he's someone I could fall in love with because it's about what's inside.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Mrs. Klump, If You're Nasty |work=[[Yahoo!

It was based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of prior album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" received positive reception, called \"impossibly catchy\" and \"classic pop\". It became Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States and stayed atop the chart for three weeks. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, which ranked her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The single fared well internationally, reaching number five in the United Kingdom, and peaking within the top-ten in Italy and Denmark. It attained a silver certification in the United Kingdom, and allowed Jam and Lewis to receive a [[Grammy]] nomination for [[Producer of the Year]]. The song was later included in two of Jackson's greatest hits collections, ''[[Number Ones (Janet Jackson album)|Number Ones]]'' and ''[[Icon: Number Ones]]''.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to clips from the movie, it features advanced technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. The video had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, being one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. Its accolades include \"Outstanding Music Video\" and \"Most Stylish Music Video\" at the [[VH1]] Fashion Awards. The song was performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]], the latter regarded as one of the leading performances of Jackson's career.\n\nA slightly modified version of the song appeared on Jackson's seventh [[album]] ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was considered to influence music videos from [[Britney Spears]], [[Jessica Simpson]] and [[Cassie (singer)|Cassie]]. The video was the first by director Joseph Kahn to feature Japanese themes and imagery, which he later used frequently following its popularity. Actress [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her debut appearances in the video, crediting Jackson for the experience and platform to star in the dance film ''[[Step Up (film)|Step Up]]''. [[Rihanna]]'s \"Watch n' Learn\" was likened to the song, and it was also covered by Japanese singer [[Hitomi Shimatani]] as \"Papillon\".\n\n==Background==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Jam & Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]]. She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of Sherman Klump, one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\"/>\n\nJackson stated that \"it really tells you about the movie and how it doesn't matter what is on the exterior, but the interior. His heart, his soul, that really matters to me. That's what I'm in love with, that's what matters to me the most, and it doesn't matter what other people say.\"<ref name=\"Making\" /> An [[Audio mastering|unmastered]] version [[internet leak|leaked]] and received airplay ahead of its scheduled release, followed by a positive response from critics and fans.

Jam recalled, \"He said, 'Now that you've seen the film, if you'd like to do a song for it, that'd be great.'\" Segal told Jackson she was an exceptional actress after becoming convinced she truly loved Murphy's character, leading Jackson to suggest writing an up-tempo love song rather than a ballad.<ref name=\"Bronson\" />\n\nThe song was based on a poem Jackson had written, discarded, then rediscovered.<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/jun/03/janet-jackson-10-of-the-best|title=Janet Jackson: 10 of the best|last=Cragg|first=Michael|website=[[The Guardian]]|date=June 3, 2015|access-date=February 7, 2020}}</ref> Jackson's original lyrics were kept intact, although its structure was altered. Jam stated that \"the lyrical idea for 'Doesn't Really Matter' is totally hers, but the music and melody was something I had done with one of our drum programmers, Alex Richburg. I thought of it as a slow melody, but we sped it up.\" Jackson wrote the remaining lyrics overnight. \"We ended up with two different choruses,\" said Jam. \"I wrote, 'Nutty, nutty, nutty, my love for you.' and she wrote 'Doesn't really matter.'\" \"The 'Doesn't really matter' chorus was better but she liked 'Nutty, nutty, nutty' and said we should put it at the end of the song.\"<ref name=\"Bronson\" /> Jackson presented three songs including \"Doesn't Really Matter\" and an early version of \"Feels So Right\", later included on Jackson's following album. Segal decided \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was a better fit and a \"summertime record.\" A slightly modified version was included on ''All for You'', featuring an alternate introduction and elements from the song's remix by [[Rockwilder]].<ref name=\"Bronson\" />\n\n==Composition==\nIn \"Doesn't Really Matter\", Jackson speaks of looking past physical appearance, choosing to love the person inside. Using a vocal [[falsetto]], Jackson assures \"[It] doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing, 'cause I'm in love with the inner being,\" considered a \"sweet song of unconditional love.\" Its theme also emphasizes self-acceptance and pride, opposing negativity. Jackson said \"It plays a major part in society, it seems today. Their image, what a woman is supposed to look like \u2013 all the things you read in the magazines about either being too thin or too this or too that, but it's really about feeling good yourself and accepting yourself. Self-acceptance, which is another story you see here in this film, is the most important thing as well as being happy with who you are.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.femail.com.au/jacksonii.htm |title=Janet Jackson \u2013 Nutty Professor II Interview |work=Femail.com.au |accessdate=February 2, 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe song is based on Jackson's character Denise's \"unconditional love\" for the obese but gentle Sherman. Jackson said, \"I loved this character so much because she didn't care about all the other things that people may have seen or saw and thought was wrong with Sherman. Those were the things she loved about him, and then on top of that she saw beyond that \u2013 how genuine of a man he is, how kind he is, a very good-hearted person and that's what she loves about him[...] he's someone I could fall in love with because it's about what's inside.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Mrs. Klump, If You're Nasty |work=[[Yahoo!

It is north of the [[celestial equator]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for \u201c(the) charioteer\u201d, associating it with various mythological beings, including [[Erichthonius of Athens|Erichthonius]] and [[Myrtilus]]. Auriga is most prominent during winter evenings in the [[northern Hemisphere]], as are five other constellations that have stars in the [[Winter Hexagon]] [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]]. Because of its northern [[declination]], Auriga is only visible in its entirety as far as 34\u00b0 south; for observers farther south it lies partially or fully below the horizon. A large constellation, with an area of 657 square degrees, it is half the size of the largest, [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]].\n\nIts brightest star, [[Capella (star)|Capella]], is an unusual [[Star system|multiple star system]] among the brightest stars in the night sky. [[Beta Aurigae]] is an interesting [[variable star]] in the constellation; [[Epsilon Aurigae]], a nearby eclipsing binary with an unusually long period, has been studied intensively. Because of its position near the winter [[Milky Way]], Auriga has many bright [[open cluster]]s in its borders, including [[Messier 36|M36]], [[Messier 37|M37]], and [[Messier 38|M38]], popular targets for amateur astronomers. In addition, it has one prominent [[nebula]], the [[Flaming Star Nebula]], associated with the variable star [[AE Aurigae]].\n\nIn Chinese mythology, Auriga's stars were incorporated into several constellations, including the celestial emperors' chariots, made up of the modern constellation's brightest stars. Auriga is home to the [[radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]] for the [[Aurigids]], [[Zeta Aurigids]], [[Delta Aurigids]], and the hypothesized [[Iota Aurigids]].\n\n== History and mythology ==\n\nThe first record of Auriga's stars was in [[Mesopotamia]] as a constellation called GAM, representing a [[scimitar]] or crook. However, this may have represented just Capella (Alpha Aurigae) or the modern constellation as a whole; this figure was alternatively called Gamlum or MUL.GAM in the [[MUL.APIN]]. The crook of Auriga stood for a goat-herd or shepherd. It was formed from most of the stars of the modern constellation; all of the bright stars were included except for [[Beta Tauri|Elnath]], traditionally assigned to both Taurus and Auriga. Later, [[Bedouin]] astronomers created constellations that were groups of animals, where each star represented one animal. The stars of Auriga comprised a herd of goats, an association also present in Greek mythology.{{sfn|Rogers, ''Mesopotamian Traditions''|1998}} The association with goats carried into the Greek astronomical tradition, though it later became associated with a charioteer along with the shepherd.{{sfn|Rogers, ''Mediterranean Traditions''|1998}}\n\nIn [[Greek mythology]], Auriga is often identified as the mythological Greek hero [[Erichthonius of Athens]], the [[chthonic]] son of [[Hephaestus]] who was raised by the goddess [[Athena]]. Erichthonius was generally credited to be the inventor of the [[quadriga]], the four-horse chariot, which he used in the battle against the usurper [[Amphictyon]], the event that made Erichthonius the king of [[Athens]].{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|p=130\u2013131}}{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2009|p=67}} His chariot was created in the image of the Sun's chariot, the reason Zeus placed him in the heavens.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Auriga}} The Athenian hero then dedicated himself to Athena and, soon after, Zeus raised him into the night sky in honor of his ingenuity and heroic deeds.{{sfn|Krupp|2007}}\n[[File:Rubens, Peter Paul - Finding of Erichthonius - 1632-1633.jpg|thumb|A painting by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] entitled ''[[Finding of Erichthonius]]''; [[Erichthonius of Athens|Erichthonius]] and Auriga are often associated.]]\n\nAuriga, however, is sometimes described as [[Myrtilus]], who was [[Hermes]]'s son and the charioteer of [[Oenomaus]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2009|p=67}} The association of Auriga and Myrtilus is supported by depictions of the constellation, which rarely show a chariot. Myrtilus's chariot was destroyed in a race intended for suitors to win the heart of Oenomaus's daughter [[Hippodamia]]. Myrtilus earned his position in the sky when Hippodamia's successful suitor, [[Pelops]], killed him, despite his complicity in helping Pelops win her hand. After his death, Myrtilus's father Hermes placed him in the sky. Yet another mythological association of Auriga is [[Theseus]]'s son [[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolytus]]. He was ejected from Athens after he refused the romantic advances of his stepmother [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]], who committed suicide as a result. He was killed when his chariot was wrecked, but revived by [[Asclepius]].{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Auriga}}{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=79}} Regardless of Auriga's specific representation, it is likely that the constellation was created by the ancient Greeks to commemorate the importance of the chariot in their society.{{sfn|Winterburn|2009|p=131}}\n\nAn incidental appearance of Auriga in Greek mythology is as the limbs of [[Medea]]'s brother. In the myth of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]], as they journeyed home, Medea killed her brother and dismembered him, flinging the parts of his body into the sea, represented by the Milky Way. Each individual star represents a different limb.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=109}}\n\n[[Capella (star)|Capella]] is associated with the mythological she-goat [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]], who breast-fed the infant Zeus. It forms an [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] with the stars [[Epsilon Aurigae]], [[Zeta Aurigae]], and [[Eta Aurigae]], the latter two of which are known as the ''Haedi'' (the [[Goat|Kids]]).{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=86\u201388}} Though most often associated with Amalthea, Capella has sometimes been associated with Amalthea's owner, a [[nymph]]. The myth of the nymph says that the goat's hideous appearance, resembling a Gorgon, was partially responsible for the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]]' defeat, because Zeus skinned the goat and wore it as his [[aegis]].{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Auriga}} The asterism containing the three goats had been a separate constellation; however, [[Ptolemy]] merged the Charioteer and the Goats in the 2nd-century [[Almagest]].{{sfn|Winterburn|2009|p=131}} Before that, Capella was sometimes seen as its own constellation\u2014by [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]]\u2014called ''Capra'', ''Caper'', or ''Hircus'', all of which relate to its status as the \"goat star\".{{sfn|Allen|1899|pp=83\u201391}} Zeta Aurigae and Eta Aurigae were first called the \"Kids\" by [[Cleostratus]], an ancient Greek astronomer.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Auriga}}\n\n[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Auriga.jpg|thumb|left|Auriga carrying the goat and kids as depicted in ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'', a set of constellation cards illustrated by Sidney Hall, London c. 1825.]]\n\nTraditionally, illustrations of Auriga represent it as a chariot and its driver. The charioteer holds a goat over his left shoulder and has two [[Goat#Reproduction|kids]] under his left arm; he holds the reins to the chariot in his right hand.{{sfn|Pasachoff|2006}} However, depictions of Auriga have been inconsistent over the years. The reins in his right hand have also been drawn as a whip, though Capella is almost always over his left shoulder and the Kids under his left arm. The 1488 atlas ''[[Hyginus]]'' deviated from this typical depiction by showing a four-wheeled cart driven by Auriga, who holds the reins of two oxen, a horse, and a zebra. [[Jacob Micyllus]] depicted Auriga in his ''Hyginus'' of 1535 as a charioteer with a two-wheeled cart, powered by two horses and two oxen. Arabic and Turkish depictions of Auriga varied wildly from those of the European Renaissance; one Turkish atlas depicted the stars of Auriga as a [[mule]], called ''Mulus clitellatus'' by [[Johann Bayer]].{{sfn|Allen|1899|pp=83\u201391}} One unusual representation of Auriga, from 17th-century France, showed Auriga as [[Adam]] kneeling on the Milky Way, with a goat wrapped around his shoulders.{{sfn|Olcott|2004|pp=65\u201369}}\n\nOccasionally, Auriga is seen not as the Charioteer but as [[Bellerophon]], the mortal rider of [[Pegasus]] who dared to approach [[Mount Olympus]]. In this version of the tale, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] pitied Bellerophon for his foolishness and placed him in the stars.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=29}}\n\n[[Oxford English Dictionary|Oxford]] research finds it likely the group was equally named Agitator in about the 15th century and provides a quotation as late as 1623, from a [[Gerard de Malynes]] multi-topic work.{{sfn|OED|2012|agitator, n.}} Some of the stars of Auriga were incorporated into a [[former constellations|now-defunct constellation]] called [[Telescopium Herschelii]]. This constellation was introduced by [[Maximilian Hell]] to honor [[William Herschel]]'s discovery of [[Uranus]].

''Wuche'', the five chariots of the celestial emperors and the representation of the grain harvest, was a constellation formed by Alpha Aurigae, Beta Aurigae, Beta Tauri, Theta Aurigae, and Iota Aurigae. ''Sanzhu'' or ''Zhu'' was one of three constellations which represented poles for horses to be tethered. They were formed by the triplets of Epsilon, Zeta, and Eta Aurigae; Nu, Tau, and Upsilon Aurigae; and Chi and 26 Aurigae, with one other undetermined star. ''Xianchi'', the pond where the sun set and ''Tianhuang'', a pond, bridge, or pier, were other constellations in Auriga, though the stars that composed them are undetermined. ''Zuoqi'', representing chairs for the emperor and other officials, was made up of nine stars in the east of the constellation. ''Bagu'', a constellation mostly formed from stars in [[Camelopardalis]] representing different types of crops, included the northern stars of Delta and Xi Aurigae.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Auriga}}\n\nIn ancient [[Hindu astronomy]], Capella represented the heart of [[Brahma]] and was important religiously.

The eastern portion of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] is the rest of the tail, while [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] is its body and [[Lepus (constellation)|Lepus]] is the head. This constellation arose because of the prominence of caymans in daily Amazonian life.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=70}} There is evidence that Capella was significant to the [[Aztec people]], as the [[Mesoamerica#Late Classic|Late Classic]] site [[Monte Alb\u00e1n]] has a marker for the star's [[heliacal rising]].{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=225}} [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous peoples]] of [[California]] and [[Nevada]] also noticed the bright pattern of Auriga's stars.

The mother of the stars, [[Ligedaner]],{{sfn|Staal|1988|pp=221\u2013222}}{{sfn|Goodenough|1953|p=43}} is represented by Capella; she lived on the island of [[Alinablab]]. She told her sons that the first to reach an eastern island would become the King of the Stars, and asked D\u00fcmur to let her come in his canoe. He refused, as did each of her sons in turn, except for Pleiades. Pleiades won the race with the help of Ligedaner, and became the King of the Stars.{{sfn|Staal|1988|pp=221\u2013222}} Elsewhere in the central [[Caroline Islands]], Capella was called ''Jefegen uun'' (variations include ''efang alul'', ''evang-el-ul'', and ''iefangel uul''), meaning \"north of Aldebaran\".{{sfn|Goodenough|1953|pp=26,43}} Different names were noted for Auriga and Capella in Eastern Pacific societies.

Its rising signalled that the constellation [[Aagjuuk]], made up of [[Altair]] (Alpha Aquilae), [[Tarazed]] (Gamma Aquilae), and sometimes [[Alshain]] (Beta Aquilae), would rise soon.

Over the subsequent two years, its brightness decreased to 11.5, and by 1903, it was approximately 14th magnitude. By 1925, it had reached its current magnitude of 15.5. When the nova was discovered, its spectrum showed material moving at a high speed towards Earth. However, when the spectrum was examined again in August 1892, it appeared to be a planetary nebula. Observations at the Lick Observatory by Edward Emerson Barnard showed it to be disc-shaped, with clear nebulosity in a diameter of 3 arcseconds. The shell had a diameter of 12 arcseconds in 1943. T Aurigae is classified as a [[slow nova]], similar to [[DQ Herculis]].

The maximum [[zenithal hourly rate]] was 100 meteors per hour, observed at 4:15&nbsp;am, California time (12:15 UTC) by a team of astronomers flying on NASA planes.{{sfn|Jenniskens|Kemp|2007}}\n\nThe Aurigids are normally a placid Class II meteor shower that peaks in the early morning hours of September 1, beginning on August 28 every year. Though the maximum [[zenithal hourly rate]] is 2\u20135 meteors per hour, the Aurigids are fast, with an entry velocity of {{convert|67|km|mi}}/sec. The annual Aurigids have a radiant located about two degrees north of [[Theta Aurigae]], a third-magnitude star in the center of the constellation.{{sfn|Lunsford, Activity}} The Aurigids end on September 4.{{sfn|Lunsford, Showers}} Some years, the maximum rate has reached 9\u201330 meteors per hour.{{sfn|Levy|2008|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\nThe other meteor showers radiating from Auriga are far less prominent and capricious than the Alpha Aurigids. The [[Zeta Aurigids]] are a weak shower with a northern and southern branch lasting from December 11 to January 21. The shower peaks on January 1 and has very slow meteors, with a maximum rate of 1\u20135 meteors per hour. It was discovered by [[William Denning]] in 1886 and was discovered to be the source of rare [[meteoroid#Fireball|fireballs]] by [[Alexander Stewart Herschel]].{{sfn|Levy|2008|pp=103\u2013104}} There is another faint stream of meteors called the \"Aurigids\", unrelated to the September shower. This shower lasts from January 31 to February 23, peaking from February 5 through February 10; its slow meteors peak at a rate of approximately 2 per hour.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=106}} The [[Delta Aurigids]] are a faint shower radiating from Auriga. It was discovered by a group of researchers at [[New Mexico State University]] and has a very low peak rate. The Delta Aurigids last from September 22 through October 23, peaking between October 6 and October 15.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=119}} They may be related to the [[September Epsilon Perseids]], though they are more similar to the [[Coma Berenicids]] in that the Delta Aurigids last longer and have a dearth of bright meteors.{{sfn|Dubietis|Arlt|2002}} They too have a hypothesized connection to an unknown short period retrograde comet.{{sfn|Drummond|1982}} The [[Iota Aurigids]] are a hypothesized shower occurring in mid-November; its parent body may be the asteroid [[2000 NL10]], but this connection is highly disputed. The hypothesized Iota Aurigids may instead be a faint stream of [[Taurids]].{{sfn|Meng|2002}}\n\n== See also==\n* [[Psi Aurigae]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|16em}}\n\n===

It is north of the [[celestial equator]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for \u201c(the) charioteer\u201d, associating it with various mythological beings, including [[Erichthonius of Athens|Erichthonius]] and [[Myrtilus]]. Auriga is most prominent during winter evenings in the [[northern Hemisphere]], as are five other constellations that have stars in the [[Winter Hexagon]] [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]]. Because of its northern [[declination]], Auriga is only visible in its entirety as far as 34\u00b0 south; for observers farther south it lies partially or fully below the horizon. A large constellation, with an area of 657 square degrees, it is half the size of the largest, [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]].\n\nIts brightest star, [[Capella (star)|Capella]], is an unusual [[Star system|multiple star system]] among the brightest stars in the night sky. [[Beta Aurigae]] is an interesting [[variable star]] in the constellation; [[Epsilon Aurigae]], a nearby eclipsing binary with an unusually long period, has been studied intensively. Because of its position near the winter [[Milky Way]], Auriga has many bright [[open cluster]]s in its borders, including [[Messier 36|M36]], [[Messier 37|M37]], and [[Messier 38|M38]], popular targets for amateur astronomers. In addition, it has one prominent [[nebula]], the [[Flaming Star Nebula]], associated with the variable star [[AE Aurigae]].\n\nIn Chinese mythology, Auriga's stars were incorporated into several constellations, including the celestial emperors' chariots, made up of the modern constellation's brightest stars. Auriga is home to the [[radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]] for the [[Aurigids]], [[Zeta Aurigids]], [[Delta Aurigids]], and the hypothesized [[Iota Aurigids]].\n\n== History and mythology ==\n\nThe first record of Auriga's stars was in [[Mesopotamia]] as a constellation called GAM, representing a [[scimitar]] or crook. However, this may have represented just Capella (Alpha Aurigae) or the modern constellation as a whole; this figure was alternatively called Gamlum or MUL.GAM in the [[MUL.APIN]]. The crook of Auriga stood for a goat-herd or shepherd. It was formed from most of the stars of the modern constellation; all of the bright stars were included except for [[Beta Tauri|Elnath]], traditionally assigned to both Taurus and Auriga. Later, [[Bedouin]] astronomers created constellations that were groups of animals, where each star represented one animal. The stars of Auriga comprised a herd of goats, an association also present in Greek mythology.{{sfn|Rogers, ''Mesopotamian Traditions''|1998}} The association with goats carried into the Greek astronomical tradition, though it later became associated with a charioteer along with the shepherd.{{sfn|Rogers, ''Mediterranean Traditions''|1998}}\n\nIn [[Greek mythology]], Auriga is often identified as the mythological Greek hero [[Erichthonius of Athens]], the [[chthonic]] son of [[Hephaestus]] who was raised by the goddess [[Athena]]. Erichthonius was generally credited to be the inventor of the [[quadriga]], the four-horse chariot, which he used in the battle against the usurper [[Amphictyon]], the event that made Erichthonius the king of [[Athens]].{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|p=130\u2013131}}{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2009|p=67}} His chariot was created in the image of the Sun's chariot, the reason Zeus placed him in the heavens.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Auriga}} The Athenian hero then dedicated himself to Athena and, soon after, Zeus raised him into the night sky in honor of his ingenuity and heroic deeds.{{sfn|Krupp|2007}}\n[[File:Rubens, Peter Paul - Finding of Erichthonius - 1632-1633.jpg|thumb|A painting by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] entitled ''[[Finding of Erichthonius]]''; [[Erichthonius of Athens|Erichthonius]] and Auriga are often associated.]]\n\nAuriga, however, is sometimes described as [[Myrtilus]], who was [[Hermes]]'s son and the charioteer of [[Oenomaus]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2009|p=67}} The association of Auriga and Myrtilus is supported by depictions of the constellation, which rarely show a chariot. Myrtilus's chariot was destroyed in a race intended for suitors to win the heart of Oenomaus's daughter [[Hippodamia]]. Myrtilus earned his position in the sky when Hippodamia's successful suitor, [[Pelops]], killed him, despite his complicity in helping Pelops win her hand. After his death, Myrtilus's father Hermes placed him in the sky. Yet another mythological association of Auriga is [[Theseus]]'s son [[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolytus]]. He was ejected from Athens after he refused the romantic advances of his stepmother [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]], who committed suicide as a result. He was killed when his chariot was wrecked, but revived by [[Asclepius]].{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Auriga}}{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=79}} Regardless of Auriga's specific representation, it is likely that the constellation was created by the ancient Greeks to commemorate the importance of the chariot in their society.{{sfn|Winterburn|2009|p=131}}\n\nAn incidental appearance of Auriga in Greek mythology is as the limbs of [[Medea]]'s brother. In the myth of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]], as they journeyed home, Medea killed her brother and dismembered him, flinging the parts of his body into the sea, represented by the Milky Way.

The reins in his right hand have also been drawn as a whip, though Capella is almost always over his left shoulder and the Kids under his left arm. The 1488 atlas ''[[Hyginus]]'' deviated from this typical depiction by showing a four-wheeled cart driven by Auriga, who holds the reins of two oxen, a horse, and a zebra. [[Jacob Micyllus]] depicted Auriga in his ''Hyginus'' of 1535 as a charioteer with a two-wheeled cart, powered by two horses and two oxen. Arabic and Turkish depictions of Auriga varied wildly from those of the European Renaissance; one Turkish atlas depicted the stars of Auriga as a [[mule]], called ''Mulus clitellatus'' by [[Johann Bayer]].{{sfn|Allen|1899|pp=83\u201391}} One unusual representation of Auriga, from 17th-century France, showed Auriga as [[Adam]] kneeling on the Milky Way, with a goat wrapped around his shoulders.{{sfn|Olcott|2004|pp=65\u201369}}\n\nOccasionally, Auriga is seen not as the Charioteer but as [[Bellerophon]], the mortal rider of [[Pegasus]] who dared to approach [[Mount Olympus]].

''Wuche'', the five chariots of the celestial emperors and the representation of the grain harvest, was a constellation formed by Alpha Aurigae, Beta Aurigae, Beta Tauri, Theta Aurigae, and Iota Aurigae. ''Sanzhu'' or ''Zhu'' was one of three constellations which represented poles for horses to be tethered. They were formed by the triplets of Epsilon, Zeta, and Eta Aurigae; Nu, Tau, and Upsilon Aurigae; and Chi and 26 Aurigae, with one other undetermined star. ''Xianchi'', the pond where the sun set and ''Tianhuang'', a pond, bridge, or pier, were other constellations in Auriga, though the stars that composed them are undetermined. ''Zuoqi'', representing chairs for the emperor and other officials, was made up of nine stars in the east of the constellation. ''Bagu'', a constellation mostly formed from stars in [[Camelopardalis]] representing different types of crops, included the northern stars of Delta and Xi Aurigae.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Auriga}}\n\nIn ancient [[Hindu astronomy]], Capella represented the heart of [[Brahma]] and was important religiously.

However, it appears to be elongated in an amateur telescope.{{sfn|Higgins|1992|p=}} Some observers may note a green hue in the nebula; a large telescope will easily show the nebula's \"peanut\" shape, as well as the quartet of stars that are engulfed by the nebula.{{sfn|Harrington|1992|p=}} The open cluster portion of NGC 1931 is classed as a I 3 p n cluster; the nebula portion is classed as both an [[emission nebula|emission]] and [[reflection nebula]].{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|pp=94\u2013101}} NGC 1931 is approximately 6,000 light-years from Earth and could easily be confused with a [[comet]] in the [[eyepiece]] of a telescope.{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=97\u201399}}\n\nNGC 1664 is a fairly large open cluster, with a diameter of 18 arcminutes, and moderately bright, with a magnitude of 7.6, comparable to several other open clusters in Auriga. One open cluster with a similar magnitude is [[NGC 1778]], with a magnitude of 7.7. This small cluster has a diameter of 7 arcminutes and contains 25 stars. [[NGC 1857]], a small cluster, is slightly brighter at magnitude 7.0. It has a diameter of 6 arcminutes and contains 40 stars, making it far more concentrated than the similar-sized NGC 1778. Far dimmer than the other open clusters is [[NGC 2126]] at magnitude 10.2. Despite its dimness, NGC 2126 is as concentrated as NGC 1857, having 40 stars in a diameter of 6 arcminutes.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=338\u2013340|loc=Table 14.12}}\n\n=== Meteor showers ===\n\n[[File:Aurigids - Jeremie Vaubaillon.jpg|thumb|The 2007 Aurigid outburst observed from 47,000 feet by a NASA mission.]]\n\nAuriga is home to two meteor showers. The [[Aurigids]], named for the entire constellation and formerly called the \"Alpha Aurigids\", are renowned for their intermittent outbursts, such as those in 1935, 1986, 1994, and 2007.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|pp=175\u2013178}} They are associated with the comet [[Kiess (C/1911 N1)]], discovered in 1911 by [[Carl Clarence Kiess]]. The association was discovered after the outburst in 1935 by [[Cuno Hoffmeister]] and [[Arthur Teichgraeber]].{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=82}} The Aurigid outburst on September 1, 1935 prompted the investigation of a connection with Comet Kiess, though the 24-year delay between the comet's return caused doubt in the scientific community. However, the outburst in 1986 erased much of this doubt. Istvan Teplickzky, a Hungarian amateur meteor observer, observed many bright meteors [[radiant (meteor shower)|radiating]] from Auriga in a fashion very similar to the confirmed 1935 outburst. Because the position of Teplickzky's observed radiant and the 1935 radiant were close to the position of Comet Kiess, the comet was confirmed as the source of the Aurigid meteor stream.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|pp=175\u2013178}}\n\nThe Aurigids had a spectacular outburst in 1994, when many [[grazing meteors]]\u2014those that have a shallow angle of entry and seem to rise from the horizon\u2014were observed in California. The meteors were tinted blue and green, moved slowly, and left trails at least 45\u00b0 long. Because they had such a shallow angle of entry, some 1994 Aurigids lasted up to 2 seconds. Though there were only a few visual observers for part of the outburst, the 1994 Aurigids peak, which lasted less than two hours, was later confirmed by Finnish amateur radio astronomer Ilkka Yrj\u00f6l\u00e4.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|pp=175\u2013178}} The connection with Comet Kiess was finally confirmed in 1994.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=82}} The 2007 outburst of the Aurigids was predicted by [[Peter Jenniskens]] and was observed by astronomers worldwide.{{sfn|Levy|2008|pp=117\u2013118}} Despite some predictions that there would be no Alpha Aurigid outburst, many bright meteors were observed throughout the shower, which peaked on September 1 as predicted. Much like in the 1994 outburst, the 2007 Aurigids were very bright and often colored blue and green. The maximum [[zenithal hourly rate]] was 100 meteors per hour, observed at 4:15&nbsp;am, California time (12:15 UTC) by a team of astronomers flying on NASA planes.{{sfn|Jenniskens|Kemp|2007}}\n\nThe Aurigids are normally a placid Class II meteor shower that peaks in the early morning hours of September 1, beginning on August 28 every year. Though the maximum [[zenithal hourly rate]] is 2\u20135 meteors per hour, the Aurigids are fast, with an entry velocity of {{convert|67|km|mi}}/sec. The annual Aurigids have a radiant located about two degrees north of [[Theta Aurigae]], a third-magnitude star in the center of the constellation.{{sfn|Lunsford, Activity}} The Aurigids end on September 4.{{sfn|Lunsford, Showers}} Some years, the maximum rate has reached 9\u201330 meteors per hour.{{sfn|Levy|2008|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\nThe other meteor showers radiating from Auriga are far less prominent and capricious than the Alpha Aurigids. The [[Zeta Aurigids]] are a weak shower with a northern and southern branch lasting from December 11 to January 21. The shower peaks on January 1 and has very slow meteors, with a maximum rate of 1\u20135 meteors per hour. It was discovered by [[William Denning]] in 1886 and was discovered to be the source of rare [[meteoroid#Fireball|fireballs]] by [[Alexander Stewart Herschel]].{{sfn|Levy|2008|pp=103\u2013104}} There is another faint stream of meteors called the \"Aurigids\", unrelated to the September shower. This shower lasts from January 31 to February 23, peaking from February 5 through February 10; its slow meteors peak at a rate of approximately 2 per hour.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=106}} The [[Delta Aurigids]] are a faint shower radiating from Auriga. It was discovered by a group of researchers at [[New Mexico State University]] and has a very low peak rate. The Delta Aurigids last from September 22 through October 23, peaking between October 6 and October 15.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=119}} They may be related to the [[September Epsilon Perseids]], though they are more similar to the [[Coma Berenicids]] in that the Delta Aurigids last longer and have a dearth of bright meteors.{{sfn|Dubietis|Arlt|2002}} They too have a hypothesized connection to an unknown short period retrograde comet.{{sfn|Drummond|1982}} The [[Iota Aurigids]] are a hypothesized shower occurring in mid-November; its parent body may be the asteroid [[2000 NL10]], but this connection is highly disputed. The hypothesized Iota Aurigids may instead be a faint stream of [[Taurids]].{{sfn|Meng|2002}}\n\n== See also==\n* [[Psi Aurigae]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|16em}}\n\n===

{"title_page": "Timothy Dempsey", "text_new": "'''Timothy Dempsey''' (October 21, 1867 - April 6, 1936) was an ordained [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Priest]] who was born in Cadamstown, Ireland and served the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis|Archdiocese of St. Louis,]] Missouri from 1891 through 1936.  Dempsey was instrumental in helping the working class and the \"down and out\" of St. Louis, founding a hotel for working men in 1906, a hotel for working women in 1911, and a segregated hotel hotel for working African American workers in 1922.  Dempsey created \"Father Tim's Free Lunch Room\" during the depression, serving millions of free meals to the public in a time of great need.  He served as mediator for many labor disputes, helping to bring resolution to several strikes during the 1920s.  In 1909, Dempsey purchased a portion of ground in an existing cemetery and devoted its use to those who had no families, naming it \"Exiles Rest,\" which is where he was interred in 1936.  The legacy of Father Tim Dempsey has continued long after his death and the organizations that he started continue to help homeless in St. Louis, operating as \"Father Tim's Charities\" under the administration of the Archdiocese of St. Louis. \n\n== Biography ==\nTimothy Dempsey was born in Cadamstown, Ireland in 1867, the first born to Thomas Dempsey and Bridget Ryan.<ref>Ancestry.com.

He first appeared in the 1992 television series ''[[Goof Troop]]'' as a [[preteen]]. He later appeared as a teenager in the spin-off film ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' (1995), its [[direct-to-video]] [[sequel]] ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]'' (2000), and in the 2001 TV series ''[[House of Mouse]]'' as a parking valet. He appeared as a child in the direct-to-video film ''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]'' (1999) and as a young adult in its sequel ''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]'' (2004). He makes a cameo appearance in the [[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|2017 DuckTales reboot]] episode \"Quack Pack\".\n\nMax has also appeared as a [[playable character]] in [[video game]]s such as ''Goof Troop'' (1993) for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], ''Disney Golf'' (2002) for the [[PlayStation 2]], and ''Disney's Extremely Goofy Skateboarding'' (2001) for [[Personal computers|PC CD]].\n\n==Origins==\nThe first appearance of Goofy's son was in the 1951 theatrical short ''Fathers Are People''. He is referred to as '''Goofy Junior''' or simply Junior. He later appeared in a few other shorts such as ''[[Father's Lion]]'' (1952), ''Father's Day Off'' (in which Goofy refers to his son as \"George\" at one point), ''Father's Weekend'' (1953), and ''[[Aquamania]]'' (1961). In these earlier films, Goofy was also portrayed with a wife, though nameless and with her face always hidden from view. When ''Goof Troop'' was created, Goofy Junior evolved into Max, and Goofy's wife was no longer on the scene. Disney Guest Services FAQ later stated there is no definitive answer regarding details of his mother, as one has not been revealed \"on the screen\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.disney.go.com/guestservices/faq?id=mnf12 |title=Disney FAQ: Who was the mother of Goofy's son Max? |publisher=[[The Walt Disney Company]] |accessdate=2014-07-31 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810155058/http://home.disney.go.com/guestservices/faq?id=mnf12 |archivedate=2014-08-10 }}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Maxwdw.jpg|thumb|left|200 px|Theme park incarnation of Max]]\nMax is one of the few Disney characters, aside from his best friend [[Pete Junior|PJ]] and [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]], child or otherwise, who has actually aged in subsequent appearances. He is depicted as an 11\u00bd-year-old in ''Goof Troop'', then a teenager in high school in ''A Goofy Movie'',<ref>In ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1RkXekdCHU The Making of A Goofy Movie]'', director [[Kevin Lima]] describes Max as being 14 years old.</ref> and then in ''An Extremely Goofy Movie'' he is a high school graduate starting college. In ''House of Mouse'', he is still a teenager but one who is old enough to be employed as a [[parking valet]]. In ''Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas'', he is a child who looks and sounds younger than he does in ''Goof Troop''. In ''Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas'', he is a young adult who is returning home for the holidays.\n\nMax, much to his own dismay, takes after his father at times, whether it be mannerisms (including Goofy's trademark laugh) or occasionally being clumsy (although that is a trait he does not display obviously in ''An Extremely Goofy Movie'' during the College X-Games competition). He feels that he is much cooler than Goofy however, and is not as earnest and humble as his old man, as he can be somewhat of a show-off at times when he excels at anything. While Goofy is still clumsy, he works hard to be a good father towards Max, at one time reprimanding him to take personal responsibility by telling him about his (Max's) great-uncle, Eliot Goof, an [[FBI]] agent with a never-give-up attitude (and a parody of [[Eliot Ness]]).<ref name=\"The Ungoofables\">{{cite episode|title=The Ungoofables|series=Goof Troop|airdate=October 19, 1992|season=1 (The Disney Afternoon)|number=27}}</ref> In the ''Goof Troop'' show, there are times he would get suckered in by [[Pete (Disney)|Pete]] and his [[get-rich-quick scheme]]s, only to come around towards the end. It seems, personality wise, that [[Pete Junior|PJ]] is more like Goofy at times, while Max seems more like Pete. Despite everything, Max loves his father, even if he does wish that Goofy would be a little more normal.\n\nIn the ''Goof Troop'' television series, Max is voiced by [[Dana Hill]], while [[Shaun Fleming]] voices the younger Max in ''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]''. [[Jason Marsden]] voices an older Max in all other appearances starting with ''A Goofy Movie''. The ''Goof Troop'' series shows some of his relatives \u2013 an older cousin named Debbie was featured in the episode \"Leader of the Pack\". In the Halloween episode \"Hallow-Weenies\" his father's \"great-great-granddaddy\" was Gooferamus T. Goofy, while a  \"Gooferamus G. Goof\" is instead referred in \"Calling All Goofs\" as Max's \"great-great-great-grandpappy\";<ref name=\"Gooferamus\">The ''Goof Troop'' episode \"Hallow-Weenies\" features a \"Gooferamus T. Goofy\", while the episode \"Calling All Goofs\" instead has Max refer to a \"Gooferamus G. Goof\". It is entirely possible that these are two separate men and are thus listed here as such, even if their names are admittedly quite similar and both are said to be Goofy's \"great-great-granddaddy\"/Max's \"great-great-great-grandpappy\".</ref> at a family reunion in \"Calling All Goofs\" his relatives are Goofy's Aunt Goophelia, Pattonleather Goof (Goofy's great-uncle and a parody of General [[George S. Patton]]), Wernher von Goof (Goofy's scientist cousin and a parody of [[Wernher von Braun]]), and M. Angelo Goof (Goofy's artist uncle and a parody of [[Michelangelo]]). In \"the Old Country\" his father's \"great-grand uncle\"<ref name=\"Frankengoof\">Goofy identified Dr. Frankengoof as his \"great grand-uncle\", an alternate description for a \"great-great-uncle\", thereby making Dr. Frankengoof Max's \"great-great-great-uncle\".</ref> was the late [[mad scientist]] Dr. Frankengoof. Other relatives include Sir Goofy of Knock-Knees A.K.A. \"Goofin' Hood\" (Max's great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-granddad, and a parody of [[Robin Hood]]), Sherlock Goof (Max's great-great-great uncle and a parody of [[Sherlock Holmes]]), Mopalong Goofy (Max's great-great-great-grandpa and a parody of [[Hopalong Cassidy]]), and Caveman Goof (Max's and Goofy's prehistoric ancestor) In one episode of ''Goof Troop'', Goofy says that Max was scared of the witch in ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' when he was younger.\n\nOver the course of his life, Max's  has been romantically involved with at least two young ladies. In ''A Goofy Movie'', Max tries to impress a popular girl at his school named Roxanne, and ends up with her by the film's end, but by the second movie, Max is apparently single again as he flirts with a number of other girls at the college. However, in an episode of ''House of Mouse'', he and Roxanne are a couple once more, on a date at the titular House of Mouse. Later, in ''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]'', Max is seen with yet another a girl named Mona, whom he brings home for Christmas to meet his father and attempts to impress her while trying not to be embarrassed by his father's goofiness. Both Roxanne and Mona are voiced by [[Kellie Martin]], except in the ''House of Mouse'' episode in which Roxanne is instead voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]].\n\nMax has a love for [[skateboarding]], as shown in the ''Goof Troop'' episodes \"Leader of the Pack\" and \"Meanwhile, Back at the Ramp\" and the films ''A Goofy Movie'' and ''An Extremely Goofy Movie''.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''Goof Troop''===\nIn the series ''[[Goof Troop]]'', Max is 11\u00bd years old,<ref name=\"You Camp Take It with You\">{{cite episode|title=You Camp Take It with You|series=Goof Troop|airdate=September 9, 1992|season=1 (The Disney Afternoon)|number=5}}</ref><ref name=\"Midnight Movie Madness\">{{cite episode|title=Midnight Movie Madness|series=Goof Troop|airdate=September 10, 1992|season=1 (The Disney Afternoon)|number=6}}</ref> active, nice, observant, friendly, and best friends with P.J., Pete's son.

He wears baggy jeans, white gloves, multicolored sneakers, and a red shirt.\n\n===''A Goofy Movie''===\n{{main|A Goofy Movie}}\n\n''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' features Max as a teenage high school student, finishing the school year before going on summer vacation. In this movie, Max has grown to find his father's goofy antics embarrassing, and is likewise viewed by his peers as a geek and a goof himself; a view he seeks to change at the school assembly when he dresses up like the musician rock star Powerline and interrupts the principal's speech to dance and perform to Powerline's hit song \"Stand Out\" before the entire student body. Additionally, Max seeks to gain the attention of his crush, a popular girl named Roxanne, whom Max is convinced only ever '[looks] right through [him]' and believes the laugh he inherited from his father (\"ah-hyuck\") is to her disliking. Though Max ends up in detention for hijacking the assembly, he succeeds in not only impressing the other students but also winning the affections of Roxanne, who shyly yet delightedly agrees to go with him to a party that is to be held the next Saturday.\n\nHowever, the principal informs Max's father, Goofy, about Max's bad behavior. Fearful that his son is becoming a delinquent, Goofy decides to take Max on a cross-country fishing trip for some 'father-son bonding', much to Max's chagrin. Before Goofy and Max hit the road, Max pays a quick visit to Roxanne's house to explain to her why he can no longer go with her to the party, but ends up lying to her that it's because he's instead going to see Powerline live in concert in Los Angeles, and that he and his father will join Powerline on stage for the last song since, as Max claims, Goofy and Powerline are old acquaintance. The guilt from this lie eats at Max throughout the film, while Goofy tries to bond with his son in ways that end up pushing Max away even further. When Goofy appoints Max the official navigator of their road trip, things go much more smoothly for the two as Max gets to pick all the stops along the way.\n\nBut, unbeknownst to Goofy, Max had secretly changed the driving route on the map to lead them to Los Angeles, and when Goofy finds out, he and Max come to a head as the two finally let out all their held-back emotions at each other before they finally reach an understanding in which Max confesses to his dad how he's felt about Roxanne and the lie he told her before. By this point, Max and Goofy admit that they are stuck together and wouldn't want to be with anyone else in this situation. The two actually make it to the Powerline concert, even appearing (accidentally) onstage. By the end of the film, when the two arrive back home, Max reveals to Roxanne that he lied, admitting that he just wanted her to like him. Roxanne in turn confesses that she already did like Max, revealing that the goofy laugh Max had been so embarrassed by was the very thing that led to her liking him. After Goofy's car suddenly explodes, he is sent crashing through the roof of Roxanne's porch, at which point Max introduces Roxanne to his dad.\n\n===''An Extremely Goofy Movie''===\n{{main|An Extremely Goofy Movie}}\n\nIn the [[direct-to-video]] sequel to ''A Goofy Movie'', ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]'', Max is a high school graduate and leaves for college with his best friends [[Pete Junior|P.J.]] and Bobby Zimuruski. He hopes to start a new life for himself and partake in the College X-Games competition. Upon his arrival to the campus, he and his friends are met by the five-time X-Games champions, the Gamma Mu Mu fraternity. However, because the Gammas invited only Max and not P.J. and Bobby to join them, Max makes a bet against the Gammas' leader, Bradley Uppercrust III, to see who will be towel boy to the other should either win the X-Games.\n\nMeanwhile, Goofy gets fired from his job (for an accident caused by his empty nest syndrome) and must go back to college to get a degree, as it's the only way for him to get a new job. He attends the same college as his son, much to Max's dismay as he'd hoped to finally get away from his father's overbearing doting. Eventually, Max manages to distract his father by introducing him to Ms. Sylvia Marpole, the college's librarian, who takes a romantic interest in Goofy and vice versa while Max sneaks off to practice his skateboarding. When Goofy gets a date with Sylvia, he rushes off to tell Max only to interfere with Max's practice, resulting in the onlooking Bradley to misinterpret Goofy's clumsy antics on Max's skateboard for skill and offers Goofy membership to the Gammas. Max encourages his father to join, viewing it as another distraction to keep Goofy further away from his X-Games practices.\n\nWhen Goofy inadvertently beats Max at the qualifying rounds for the College X-Games (thanks in part to some sneaky cheating by Bradley), Max ends up blowing up at his father, revealing his desires to get away from his father and [[Family estrangement|estranges]] him completely by telling him to \"leave him alone and get his own life\", sending Goofy into depression. When Goofy later overhears the Gammas' plan to cheat in the games, Goofy tries to warn his son, who doesn't believe him, as he still wants him out of his life. But once it becomes clear to Max (during the X-Games' final round) that the Gammas really have been cheating all along, Max realizes that Goofy was telling the truth and, feeling remorseful for disowning him, manages to ask his dad to fill in for the incapacitated P.J., which Goofy happily accepts. During the final stretch of the triathlon, Bradley activates a rocket hidden in Max's skateboard, causing an explosion that ends up trapping  fellow Gamma member Tank underneath some fallen fiery debris. Max forgoes heading straight to the finish line to first rescue Tank (with help from Goofy) and ultimately manages to just barely beat Bradley to the finish line. In the end, both father and son make amends at Goofy's graduation and Max gives his father the X-Games championship trophy as an apology gift for his unkind and selfish disownment while Goofy finally sees that Max no longer needs a guardian as the two part ways, with Goofy (now cured of his empty nest syndrome) heading to another date with Sylvia, and finally leaving Max to at last live his own life at college.\n\n===''Disney's House of Mouse''===\nIn the ''[[Disney's House of Mouse|House of Mouse]]'' TV series, Max is still a teenager (although considerably older than in a Goofy Movie) and works as the [[valet parking|parking valet]] for the club, and appears to be most level-headed and calm of all the club's employees. However, this may be because his duties are not nearly as important as some of the others, and his inclusions are just to help out the rest of the cast. However, in episodes that revolve around him or Goofy, his insecurities and personal flaws are much more noticeable and intentional.\n\nIn the episode \"Max's Embarrassing Date\", Max is off work and on a date with Roxanne at the House of Mouse. While all the main Disney cast ([[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]], [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]], [[Donald Duck|Donald]] and [[Daisy Duck|Daisy]]) attempted to keep Goofy away from the two so as to not embarrass Max in front of Roxanne, they ended up embarrassing him themselves until Goofy finally cuts in to give Max and Roxanne some privacy for the night. Max makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]'' when the villains are entering the House of Mouse.\n\n===''Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas'' and ''Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas''===\nIn the direct-to-video [[traditional animation|traditionally animated]] film ''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]'', in the segment \"A Very Goofy Christmas\", Max goes bicycling into the mall with his father, Goofy, to catch up to the mail truck in order to mail his letter to Santa. However, when their neighbor Pete tells Max that there is no such thing as Santa, Goofy goes out of his way to try to prove to Max that Santa does exist. However, after staying up all night with no luck, Goofy is filled with disappointment, leaving it to Max to cheer his father. In the end, Santa finally arrives to the joyful awe and wonderment of Goofy and Max. In this film, Max is a little boy, placing \"A Very Goofy Christmas\" chronologically before all other titles Max appears in.\n\nThe direct-to-video [[computer animation|computer animated]] film ''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]'' (a sequel to ''Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas'') is currently Max's latest appearance in any Disney media produced. In the segment titled \"Christmas Maximus\", Max has grown up into a young adult. He brings his lady friend Mona (whom Max hopes to make his girlfriend) home for Christmas to meet his father. Goofy picks them up at the train station and brings them back to the house, where Goofy shows Mona Max's baby pictures and unwittingly embarrasses Max with all his fatherly love. In the end, as Mona finds Goofy's quirks to be endearing, Max decides to forget his embarrassment and join in the fun.\n\nMax later appears (in a non-speaking role) with his father and the other characters in the last segment of the film, \"Mickey's Dog-Gone Christmas\", in which they drive around the city in a snowplow to look for Pluto, who had previously run away after his having angering Mickey. After Pluto returns, everyone (Max included) pulls up to Mickey's house in the snowplow, exits the snowplow, and goes inside the house to celebrate Christmas. Max and everyone applaud Mickey and Pluto topping the Christmas tree with the star decoration, and then they all join in singing a short medley of \"[[We Wish You a Merry Christmas]]\" and \"[[Deck the Halls]]\" to close out the special.\n\nDuring the end credits sequence, a pop-up book version of Max and Mona are seen sliding close to each other (presumably to share a kiss) before a pop-up version of Goofy covers them both from view with a picture frame containing credits specific to the \"Christmas Maximus\" segment. Later, the closing image of Goofy and Max holding a Christmas caroling book together from the end of \"Mickey's Dog-Gone Christmas\" is shown again towards the end of the credits, as the last time Max was seen in Disney animation to date.\n\n===''DuckTales''===\nIn the 2017 [[Ducktales (2017 TV series)]] series, Goofy refers to \"Maxie\" by name in the episode \"Quack Pack!\", when the former shows pictures of him and Max in his wallet, with one showing Max and Roxanne.<ref name=\"Quack Pack!\">{{cite episode|title=Quack Pack!|series=DuckTales|airdate=2020-04-04|season=3|number=49}}</ref>\n\n==''Disney Parks''==\nAt the [[Walt Disney World Resort]], Max is a [[meetable character]].

He first appeared in the 1992 television series ''[[Goof Troop]]'' as a [[preteen]]. He later appeared as a teenager in the spin-off film ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' (1995), its [[direct-to-video]] [[sequel]] ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]'' (2000), and in the 2001 TV series ''[[House of Mouse]]'' as a parking valet. He appeared as a child in the direct-to-video film ''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]'' (1999) and as a young adult in its sequel ''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]'' (2004). He makes a cameo appearance in the [[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|2017 DuckTales reboot]] episode \"Quack Pack\".\n\nMax has also appeared as a [[playable character]] in [[video game]]s such as ''Goof Troop'' (1993) for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], ''Disney Golf'' (2002) for the [[PlayStation 2]], and ''Disney's Extremely Goofy Skateboarding'' (2001) for [[Personal computers|PC CD]].\n\n==Origins==\nThe first appearance of Goofy's son was in the 1951 theatrical short ''Fathers Are People''. He is referred to as '''Goofy Junior''' or simply Junior. He later appeared in a few other shorts such as ''[[Father's Lion]]'' (1952), ''Father's Day Off'' (in which Goofy refers to his son as \"George\" at one point), ''Father's Weekend'' (1953), and ''[[Aquamania]]'' (1961). In these earlier films, Goofy was also portrayed with a wife, though nameless and with her face always hidden from view. When ''Goof Troop'' was created, Goofy Junior evolved into Max, and Goofy's wife was no longer on the scene. Disney Guest Services FAQ later stated there is no definitive answer regarding details of his mother, as one has not been revealed \"on the screen\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.disney.go.com/guestservices/faq?id=mnf12 |title=Disney FAQ: Who was the mother of Goofy's son Max? |publisher=[[The Walt Disney Company]] |accessdate=2014-07-31 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810155058/http://home.disney.go.com/guestservices/faq?id=mnf12 |archivedate=2014-08-10 }}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Maxwdw.jpg|thumb|left|200 px|Theme park incarnation of Max]]\nMax is one of the few Disney characters, aside from his best friend [[Pete Junior|PJ]] and [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]], child or otherwise, who has actually aged in subsequent appearances. He is depicted as an 11\u00bd-year-old in ''Goof Troop'', then a teenager in high school in ''A Goofy Movie'',<ref>In ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1RkXekdCHU The Making of A Goofy Movie]'', director [[Kevin Lima]] describes Max as being 14 years old.</ref> and then in ''An Extremely Goofy Movie'' he is a high school graduate starting college. In ''House of Mouse'', he is still a teenager but one who is old enough to be employed as a [[parking valet]]. In ''Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas'', he is a child who looks and sounds younger than he does in ''Goof Troop''. In ''Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas'', he is a young adult who is returning home for the holidays.\n\nMax, much to his own dismay, takes after his father at times, whether it be mannerisms (including Goofy's trademark laugh) or occasionally being clumsy (although that is a trait he does not display obviously in ''An Extremely Goofy Movie'' during the College X-Games competition). He feels that he is much cooler than Goofy however, and is not as earnest and humble as his old man, as he can be somewhat of a show-off at times when he excels at anything. While Goofy is still clumsy, he works hard to be a good father towards Max, at one time reprimanding him to take personal responsibility by telling him about his (Max's) great-uncle, Eliot Goof, an [[FBI]] agent with a never-give-up attitude (and a parody of [[Eliot Ness]]).<ref name=\"The Ungoofables\">{{cite episode|title=The Ungoofables|series=Goof Troop|airdate=October 19, 1992|season=1 (The Disney Afternoon)|number=27}}</ref> In the ''Goof Troop'' show, there are times he would get suckered in by [[Pete (Disney)|Pete]] and his [[get-rich-quick scheme]]s, only to come around towards the end. It seems, personality wise, that [[Pete Junior|PJ]] is more like Goofy at times, while Max seems more like Pete. Despite everything, Max loves his father, even if he does wish that Goofy would be a little more normal.\n\nIn the ''Goof Troop'' television series, Max is voiced by [[Dana Hill]], while [[Shaun Fleming]] voices the younger Max in ''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]''. [[Jason Marsden]] voices an older Max in all other appearances starting with ''A Goofy Movie''. The ''Goof Troop'' series shows some of his relatives \u2013 an older cousin named Debbie was featured in the episode \"Leader of the Pack\". In the Halloween episode \"Hallow-Weenies\" his father's \"great-great-granddaddy\" was Gooferamus T. Goofy, while a  \"Gooferamus G. Goof\" is instead referred in \"Calling All Goofs\" as Max's \"great-great-great-grandpappy\";<ref name=\"Gooferamus\">The ''Goof Troop'' episode \"Hallow-Weenies\" features a \"Gooferamus T. Goofy\", while the episode \"Calling All Goofs\" instead has Max refer to a \"Gooferamus G. Goof\". It is entirely possible that these are two separate men and are thus listed here as such, even if their names are admittedly quite similar and both are said to be Goofy's \"great-great-granddaddy\"/Max's \"great-great-great-grandpappy\".</ref> at a family reunion in \"Calling All Goofs\" his relatives are Goofy's Aunt Goophelia, Pattonleather Goof (Goofy's great-uncle and a parody of General [[George S. Patton]]), Wernher von Goof (Goofy's scientist cousin and a parody of [[Wernher von Braun]]), and M. Angelo Goof (Goofy's artist uncle and a parody of [[Michelangelo]]). In \"the Old Country\" his father's \"great-grand uncle\"<ref name=\"Frankengoof\">Goofy identified Dr. Frankengoof as his \"great grand-uncle\", an alternate description for a \"great-great-uncle\", thereby making Dr. Frankengoof Max's \"great-great-great-uncle\".</ref> was the late [[mad scientist]] Dr. Frankengoof. Other relatives include Sir Goofy of Knock-Knees A.K.A. \"Goofin' Hood\" (Max's great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-granddad, and a parody of [[Robin Hood]]), Sherlock Goof (Max's great-great-great uncle and a parody of [[Sherlock Holmes]]), Mopalong Goofy (Max's great-great-great-grandpa and a parody of [[Hopalong Cassidy]]), and Caveman Goof (Max's and Goofy's prehistoric ancestor) In one episode of ''Goof Troop'', Goofy says that Max was scared of the witch in ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' when he was younger.\n\nOver the course of his life, Max's  has been romantically involved with at least two young ladies. In ''A Goofy Movie'', Max tries to impress a popular girl at his school named Roxanne, and ends up with her by the film's end, but by the second movie, Max is apparently single again as he flirts with a number of other girls at the college. However, in an episode of ''House of Mouse'', he and Roxanne are a couple once more, on a date at the titular House of Mouse. Later, in ''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]'', Max is seen with yet another a girl named Mona, whom he brings home for Christmas to meet his father and attempts to impress her while trying not to be embarrassed by his father's goofiness. Both Roxanne and Mona are voiced by [[Kellie Martin]], except in the ''House of Mouse'' episode in which Roxanne is instead voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]].\n\nMax has a love for [[skateboarding]], as shown in the ''Goof Troop'' episodes \"Leader of the Pack\" and \"Meanwhile, Back at the Ramp\" and the films ''A Goofy Movie'' and ''An Extremely Goofy Movie''.\n\n==Appearances==\n===''Goof Troop''===\nIn the series ''[[Goof Troop]]'', Max is 11\u00bd years old,<ref name=\"You Camp Take It with You\">{{cite episode|title=You Camp Take It with You|series=Goof Troop|airdate=September 9, 1992|season=1 (The Disney Afternoon)|number=5}}</ref><ref name=\"Midnight Movie Madness\">{{cite episode|title=Midnight Movie Madness|series=Goof Troop|airdate=September 10, 1992|season=1 (The Disney Afternoon)|number=6}}</ref> active, nice, observant, friendly, and best friends with P.J., Pete's son.

He wears baggy jeans, white gloves, multicolored sneakers, and a red shirt.\n\n===''A Goofy Movie''===\n{{main|A Goofy Movie}}\n\n''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' features Max as a teenage high school student, finishing the school year before going on summer vacation. In this movie, Max has grown to find his father's goofy antics embarrassing, and is likewise viewed by his peers as a geek and a goof himself; a view he seeks to change at the school assembly when he dresses up like the musician rock star Powerline and interrupts the principal's speech to dance and perform to Powerline's hit song \"Stand Out\" before the entire student body. Additionally, Max seeks to gain the attention of his crush, a popular girl named Roxanne, whom Max is convinced only ever '[looks] right through [him]' and believes the laugh he inherited from his father (\"ah-hyuck\") is to her disliking. Though Max ends up in detention for hijacking the assembly, he succeeds in not only impressing the other students but also winning the affections of Roxanne, who shyly yet delightedly agrees to go with him to a party that is to be held the next Saturday.\n\nHowever, the principal informs Max's father, Goofy, about Max's bad behavior. Fearful that his son is becoming a delinquent, Goofy decides to take Max on a cross-country fishing trip for some 'father-son bonding', much to Max's chagrin. Before Goofy and Max hit the road, Max pays a quick visit to Roxanne's house to explain to her why he can no longer go with her to the party, but ends up lying to her that it's because he's instead going to see Powerline live in concert in Los Angeles, and that he and his father will join Powerline on stage for the last song since, as Max claims, Goofy and Powerline are old acquaintance. The guilt from this lie eats at Max throughout the film, while Goofy tries to bond with his son in ways that end up pushing Max away even further. When Goofy appoints Max the official navigator of their road trip, things go much more smoothly for the two as Max gets to pick all the stops along the way.\n\nBut, unbeknownst to Goofy, Max had secretly changed the driving route on the map to lead them to Los Angeles, and when Goofy finds out, he and Max come to a head as the two finally let out all their held-back emotions at each other before they finally reach an understanding in which Max confesses to his dad how he's felt about Roxanne and the lie he told her before. By this point, Max and Goofy admit that they are stuck together and wouldn't want to be with anyone else in this situation. The two actually make it to the Powerline concert, even appearing (accidentally) onstage. By the end of the film, when the two arrive back home, Max reveals to Roxanne that he lied, admitting that he just wanted her to like him. Roxanne in turn confesses that she already did like Max, revealing that the goofy laugh Max had been so embarrassed by was the very thing that led to her liking him. After Goofy's car suddenly explodes, he is sent crashing through the roof of Roxanne's porch, at which point Max introduces Roxanne to his dad.\n\n===''An Extremely Goofy Movie''===\n{{main|An Extremely Goofy Movie}}\n\nIn the [[direct-to-video]] sequel to ''A Goofy Movie'', ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]'', Max is a high school graduate and leaves for college with his best friends [[Pete Junior|P.J.]] and Bobby Zimuruski.

Sunspots have been observed since the early 17th century and the sunspot time series is the longest, continuously observed (recorded) time series of any natural phenomena. Accompanying the 11 year quasi-periodicity in sunspots, the large-scale dipolar (north-south) magnetic field component of the Sun also flips every 11 years, however, the peak in the dipolar field lags the peak in the sunspot number, with the former occurring at the minimum between two cycles. Levels of [[solar radiation]] and ejection of solar material, the number and size of [[sunspot]]s, [[solar flare]]s, and [[coronal loop]]s all exhibit a synchronized fluctuation, from active to quiet to active again, with a period of 11 years.  This cycle has been observed for centuries by changes in the Sun's appearance and by terrestrial phenomena such as [[Aurora (astronomy)|auroras]]. Solar activity, driven both by the sunspot cycle and transient aperiodic processes govern the environment of the Solar System planets by creating space weather and impact space- and ground-based technologies as well as the Earth's atmosphere and also possibly climate fluctuations on scales of centuries and longer.\n \nUnderstanding and predicting the sunspot cycle remains one of the grand challenges in astrophysics with major ramifications for space science and the understanding of magnetohydrodynamic phenomena elsewhere in the Universe.\n\n[[File:Evolution of Magnetism on the Sun.ogv|thumb|Evolution of magnetism on the Sun.]]\n\n== Definition ==\nSolar cycles have an average duration of about 11 years.

In 1919 they showed that the magnetic polarity of sunspot pairs:\n* Is constant throughout a cycle;\n* Is opposite across the equator throughout a cycle;\n* Reverses itself from one cycle to the next.\n\nHale's observations revealed that the complete magnetic cycle spans two solar cycles, or 22 years, before returning to its original state (including polarity). Because nearly all manifestations are insensitive to polarity, the \"11-year solar cycle\" remains the focus of research; however, the two halves of the 22-year cycle are typically not identical: the 11-year cycles usually alternate between higher and lower sums of [[Wolf number|Wolf's sunspot numbers]] (the [[Gnevyshev-Ohl rule]]).<ref name=\"hathaway_review\" />\n\nIn 1961 the father-and-son team of [[Harold D. Babcock|Harold]] and [[Horace Babcock]] established that the solar cycle is a spatiotemporal magnetic process unfolding over the Sun as a whole. They observed that the solar surface is magnetized outside of sunspots, that this (weaker) magnetic field is to first order a [[dipole]], and that this dipole undergoes polarity reversals with the same period as the sunspot cycle.

Complex coronal magnetic field structures evolve in response to fluid motions at the solar surface, and emergence of [[magnetic flux]] produced by [[solar dynamo|dynamo]] action in the solar interior. For reasons not yet understood in detail, sometimes these structures lose stability, leading to [[coronal mass ejections]] into interplanetary space, or [[Solar flares|flares]], caused by sudden localized release of magnetic energy driving emission of ultraviolet and X-ray radiation as well as energetic particles. These eruptive phenomena can have a significant impact on Earth's upper atmosphere and space environment, and are the primary drivers of what is now called [[space weather]].\n\nThe occurrence frequency of coronal mass ejections and flares is strongly modulated by the cycle. Flares of any given size are some 50 times more frequent at solar maximum than at minimum. Large coronal mass ejections occur on average a few times a day at solar maximum, down to one every few days at solar minimum. The size of these events themselves does not depend sensitively on the phase of the solar cycle. A case in point are the three large X-class flares that occurred in December 2006, very near solar minimum; an X9.0 flare on Dec 5 stands as one of the brightest on record.<ref>{{Cite journal\n | title=The Most Powerful Solar Flares Ever Recorded\n | website=Spaceweather.com\n | url=http://www.spaceweather.com/solarflares/topflares.html\n }}</ref>\n\n== Patterns ==\n[[File:SpaceEnvironmentOverview From 19830101.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|An overview of three solar cycles shows the relationship between the sunspot cycle, galactic cosmic rays, and the state of our near-space environment.<ref>{{cite web | title=Extreme Space Weather Events | publisher=[[National Geophysical Data Center]] | url=http://sxi.ngdc.noaa.gov/sxi_greatest.html | accessdate=2015-11-17}}</ref>]]\n\nThe Waldmeier effect names the observation that cycles with larger maximum amplitudes tend to take less time to reach their maxima than cycles with smaller amplitudes;<ref>[[Max Waldmeier|Waldmeier M.]], 1939, Astron.

This flux is dispersed and churned by turbulent convection and solar large-scale flows. These transport mechanisms lead to the accumulation of magnetized decay products at high solar latitudes, eventually reversing the polarity of the polar fields (notice how the blue and yellow fields reverse in the Hathaway/NASA/MSFC graph above).\n\nThe dipolar component of the solar magnetic field reverses polarity around the time of solar maximum and reaches peak strength at the solar minimum.\n\n=== Space ===\n\n==== Spacecraft ====\nCMEs ([[coronal mass ejection]]s) produce a radiation flux of high-energy [[protons]], sometimes known as solar cosmic rays.  These can cause radiation damage to electronics and [[solar cell]]s in [[satellites]].  Solar proton events also can cause [[single-event upset]] (SEU) events on electronics; at the same, the reduced flux of galactic cosmic radiation during solar maximum decreases the high-energy component of particle flux.\n\nCME radiation is dangerous to [[astronaut]]s on a space mission who are outside the shielding produced by the [[Earth's magnetic field]]. Future mission designs (''e.g.'', for a [[Manned mission to Mars|Mars Mission]]) therefore incorporate a radiation-shielded \"storm shelter\" for astronauts to retreat to during such an event.\n\nGlei\u00dfberg developed a CME forecasting method that relies on consecutive cycles.<ref>{{cite book |author=Wolfgang Glei\u00dfberg |title=Die H\u00e4ufigkeit der Sonnenflecken |publisher=Ahademie Verlag |location=Berlin |date=1953 |language=German}}</ref>\n\nOn the positive side, the increased irradiance during solar maximum expands the envelope of the Earth's atmosphere, causing low-orbiting [[space debris]] to re-enter more quickly.\n\n==== Galactic cosmic ray flux ====\nThe outward expansion of solar ejecta into interplanetary space provides overdensities of plasma that are efficient at scattering high-energy [[cosmic rays]] entering the solar system from elsewhere in the galaxy. The frequency of solar eruptive events is modulated by the cycle, changing the degree of cosmic ray scattering in the outer solar system accordingly.

However, hotter upper layers of the Sun's atmosphere ([[chromosphere]] and [[solar corona|corona]]) emit more short-wavelength radiation.

F10.7 is often expressed in SFU or [[Spectral irradiance#Solar energy|solar flux units]] (1 SFU = 10<sup>\u221222</sup> W m<sup>\u22122</sup> Hz<sup>\u22121</sup>). It represents a measure of diffuse, nonradiative coronal plasma heating. It is an excellent indicator of overall solar activity levels and correlates well with solar UV emissions.\n\nSunspot activity has a major effect on long distance [[radio communications]], particularly on the [[shortwave]] bands although medium wave and low [[VHF]] frequencies are also affected. High levels of sunspot activity lead to improved signal propagation on higher frequency bands, although they also increase the levels of solar noise and ionospheric disturbances.

At solar minimum, the toroidal field is, correspondingly, at minimum strength, sunspots are relatively rare and the poloidal field is at maximum strength. During the next cycle, differential rotation converts magnetic energy back from the poloidal to the toroidal field, with a polarity that is opposite to the previous cycle.

The Sun has a radiative core surrounded by a convective envelope, and at the boundary of these two is the [[tachocline]].  However, brown dwarfs lack radiative cores and tachoclines.

Sunspots have been observed since the early 17th century and the sunspot time series is the longest, continuously observed (recorded) time series of any natural phenomena. Accompanying the 11 year quasi-periodicity in sunspots, the large-scale dipolar (north-south) magnetic field component of the Sun also flips every 11 years, however, the peak in the dipolar field lags the peak in the sunspot number, with the former occurring at the minimum between two cycles. Levels of [[solar radiation]] and ejection of solar material, the number and size of [[sunspot]]s, [[solar flare]]s, and [[coronal loop]]s all exhibit a synchronized fluctuation, from active to quiet to active again, with a period of 11 years.  This cycle has been observed for centuries by changes in the Sun's appearance and by terrestrial phenomena such as [[Aurora (astronomy)|auroras]]. Solar activity, driven both by the sunspot cycle and transient aperiodic processes govern the environment of the Solar System planets by creating space weather and impact space- and ground-based technologies as well as the Earth's atmosphere and also possibly climate fluctuations on scales of centuries and longer.\n \nUnderstanding and predicting the sunspot cycle remains one of the grand challenges in astrophysics with major ramifications for space science and the understanding of magnetohydrodynamic phenomena elsewhere in the Universe. \n\n[[File:Evolution of Magnetism on the Sun.ogv|thumb|Evolution of magnetism on the Sun.]]\n\n== Definition ==\nSolar cycles have an average duration of about 11 years.

In 1919 they showed that the magnetic polarity of sunspot pairs:\n* Is constant throughout a cycle;\n* Is opposite across the equator throughout a cycle;\n* Reverses itself from one cycle to the next.\n\nHale's observations revealed that the complete magnetic cycle spans two solar cycles, or 22 years, before returning to its original state (including polarity). Because nearly all manifestations are insensitive to polarity, the \"11-year solar cycle\" remains the focus of research; however, the two halves of the 22-year cycle are typically not identical: the 11-year cycles usually alternate between higher and lower sums of [[Wolf number|Wolf's sunspot numbers]] (the [[Gnevyshev-Ohl rule]]).<ref name=\"hathaway_review\" />\n\nIn 1961 the father-and-son team of [[Harold D. Babcock|Harold]] and [[Horace Babcock]] established that the solar cycle is a spatiotemporal magnetic process unfolding over the Sun as a whole. They observed that the solar surface is magnetized outside of sunspots, that this (weaker) magnetic field is to first order a [[dipole]], and that this dipole undergoes polarity reversals with the same period as the sunspot cycle. Horace's [[Babcock Model]] described the Sun's oscillatory magnetic field as having a quasi-steady periodicity of 22 years.<ref name=\"Schwabe\"/><ref name=\"oma.be\">{{cite web|url=http://sidc.oma.be/sunspot-index-graphics/wolfjmms.php|title=Sunspot Number graphics|work=oma.be}}</ref> It covered the oscillatory exchange of energy between [[toroidal and poloidal]] solar magnetic field ingredients.\n\n== Cycle history ==\n[[File:Sunspots 11000 years.svg|thumb|300x300px|Reconstruction of solar activity over 11,400&nbsp;years.

This pattern is best visualized in the form of the so-called butterfly diagram. Images of the Sun are divided into latitudinal strips, and the monthly-averaged fractional surface of sunspots is calculated. This is plotted vertically as a color-coded bar, and the process is repeated month after month to produce this time-series diagram.\n\n[[File:Sunspot-bfly.gif|thumb|upright=3|center|F2|The sunspot butterfly diagram.

Complex coronal magnetic field structures evolve in response to fluid motions at the solar surface, and emergence of [[magnetic flux]] produced by [[solar dynamo|dynamo]] action in the solar interior. For reasons not yet understood in detail, sometimes these structures lose stability, leading to [[coronal mass ejections]] into interplanetary space, or [[Solar flares|flares]], caused by sudden localized release of magnetic energy driving emission of ultraviolet and X-ray radiation as well as energetic particles. These eruptive phenomena can have a significant impact on Earth's upper atmosphere and space environment, and are the primary drivers of what is now called [[space weather]].\n\nThe occurrence frequency of coronal mass ejections and flares is strongly modulated by the cycle. Flares of any given size are some 50 times more frequent at solar maximum than at minimum. Large coronal mass ejections occur on average a few times a day at solar maximum, down to one every few days at solar minimum. The size of these events themselves does not depend sensitively on the phase of the solar cycle. A case in point are the three large X-class flares that occurred in December 2006, very near solar minimum; an X9.0 flare on Dec 5 stands as one of the brightest on record.<ref>{{Cite journal\n | title=The Most Powerful Solar Flares Ever Recorded\n | website=Spaceweather.com\n | url=http://www.spaceweather.com/solarflares/topflares.html\n }}</ref>\n\n== Patterns ==\n[[File:SpaceEnvironmentOverview From 19830101.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|An overview of three solar cycles shows the relationship between the sunspot cycle, galactic cosmic rays, and the state of our near-space environment.<ref>{{cite web | title=Extreme Space Weather Events | publisher=[[National Geophysical Data Center]] | url=http://sxi.ngdc.noaa.gov/sxi_greatest.html | accessdate=2015-11-17}}</ref>]]\n\nThe Waldmeier effect names the observation that cycles with larger maximum amplitudes tend to take less time to reach their maxima than cycles with smaller amplitudes;<ref>[[Max Waldmeier|Waldmeier M.]], 1939, Astron.

This flux is dispersed and churned by turbulent convection and solar large-scale flows. These transport mechanisms lead to the accumulation of magnetized decay products at high solar latitudes, eventually reversing the polarity of the polar fields (notice how the blue and yellow fields reverse in the Hathaway/NASA/MSFC graph above).\n\nThe dipolar component of the solar magnetic field reverses polarity around the time of solar maximum and reaches peak strength at the solar minimum.\n\n=== Space ===\n\n==== Spacecraft ====\nCMEs ([[coronal mass ejection]]s) produce a radiation flux of high-energy [[protons]], sometimes known as solar cosmic rays.  These can cause radiation damage to electronics and [[solar cell]]s in [[satellites]].  Solar proton events also can cause [[single-event upset]] (SEU) events on electronics; at the same, the reduced flux of galactic cosmic radiation during solar maximum decreases the high-energy component of particle flux.\n\nCME radiation is dangerous to [[astronaut]]s on a space mission who are outside the shielding produced by the [[Earth's magnetic field]]. Future mission designs (''e.g.'', for a [[Manned mission to Mars|Mars Mission]]) therefore incorporate a radiation-shielded \"storm shelter\" for astronauts to retreat to during such an event.\n\nGlei\u00dfberg developed a CME forecasting method that relies on consecutive cycles.<ref>{{cite book |author=Wolfgang Glei\u00dfberg |title=Die H\u00e4ufigkeit der Sonnenflecken |publisher=Ahademie Verlag |location=Berlin |date=1953 |language=German}}</ref>\n\nOn the positive side, the increased irradiance during solar maximum expands the envelope of the Earth's atmosphere, causing low-orbiting [[space debris]] to re-enter more quickly.\n\n==== Galactic cosmic ray flux ====\nThe outward expansion of solar ejecta into interplanetary space provides overdensities of plasma that are efficient at scattering high-energy [[cosmic rays]] entering the solar system from elsewhere in the galaxy. The frequency of solar eruptive events is modulated by the cycle, changing the degree of cosmic ray scattering in the outer solar system accordingly.

Credit: the Yohkoh mission of [[Institute of Space and Astronautical Science|ISAS]] (Japan) and [[NASA]] (US).]]\nWith a temperature of 5870 K, the [[photosphere]] emits a proportion of radiation in the [[extreme ultraviolet]] (EUV) and above. However, hotter upper layers of the Sun's atmosphere ([[chromosphere]] and [[corona]]) emit more short-wavelength radiation. Since the upper atmosphere is not homogeneous and contains significant magnetic structure, the solar ultraviolet (UV), [[Extreme ultraviolet|EUV]] and X-ray flux varies markedly over the cycle.\n\nThe photo montage to the left illustrates this variation for soft [[X-ray]], as observed by the Japanese satellite [[Yohkoh]] from after August 30, 1991, at the peak of cycle 22, to September 6, 2001, at the peak of cycle 23. Similar cycle-related variations are observed in the flux of solar UV or EUV radiation, as observed, for example, by the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] or [[TRACE]] satellites.\n\nEven though it only accounts for a minuscule fraction of total solar radiation, the impact of solar UV, EUV and X-ray radiation on the Earth's upper atmosphere is profound. Solar UV flux is a major driver of [[Stratosphere|stratospheric chemistry]], and increases in ionizing radiation significantly affect [[ionosphere]]-influenced temperature and [[electrical conductivity]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Solar radio flux====\nEmission from the Sun at centimetric (radio) wavelength is due primarily to coronal plasma trapped in the magnetic fields overlying active regions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tapping K.F. |title=Recent solar radio astronomy at centimeter wavelength: the temporal variability of the 10.7-cm flux |journal=J.

It represents a measure of diffuse, nonradiative coronal plasma heating. It is an excellent indicator of overall solar activity levels and correlates well with solar UV emissions.\n\nSunspot activity has a major effect on long distance [[radio communications]], particularly on the [[shortwave]] bands although medium wave and low [[VHF]] frequencies are also affected. High levels of sunspot activity lead to improved signal propagation on higher frequency bands, although they also increase the levels of solar noise and ionospheric disturbances.

At this point in the dynamo cycle, buoyant upwelling within the [[Convection zone]] forces emergence of the toroidal magnetic field through the photosphere, giving rise to pairs of sunspots, roughly aligned east\u2013west with opposite magnetic polarities. The magnetic polarity of sunspot pairs alternates every solar cycle, a phenomenon known as the Hale cycle.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Hale | first1 = G.

At solar minimum, the toroidal field is, correspondingly, at minimum strength, sunspots are relatively rare and the poloidal field is at maximum strength. During the next cycle, differential rotation converts magnetic energy back from the poloidal to the toroidal field, with a polarity that is opposite to the previous cycle. The process carries on continuously, and in an idealized, simplified scenario, each 11-year sunspot cycle corresponds to a change in the polarity of the Sun's large-scale magnetic field.<ref>{{Cite news\n |date=16 February 2001 \n |title=Sun flips magnetic field \n |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/space/02/16/sun.flips/index.html \n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051115051328/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/space/02/16/sun.flips/index.html \n |url-status=dead \n |archive-date=15 November 2005 \n |work=[[CNN]] \n |accessdate=11 July 2009 \n}}http://www.cnn.com/2001/TECH/space/02/16/sun.flips/index.html</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |last=Phillips \n |first=T. \n |date=15 February 2001 \n |title=The Sun Does a Flip \n |url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2001/ast15feb_1.htm \n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011104023531/https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2001/ast15feb_1.htm \n |url-status=dead \n |archive-date=4 November 2001 \n |publisher=[[NASA]] \n |accessdate=11 July 2009 \n}}</ref>\n\nSolar dynamo models indicate that plasma flux transport processes in the solar interior such as differential rotation, meridional circulation and turbulent pumping play an important role in the recycling of the toroidal and poloidal components of the solar magnetic field ([https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-637X/832/1/9/meta Hazra and Nandy 2016]). The relative strengths of these flux transport processes also determine the \"memory\" of the solar cycle that plays an important role in physics-based predictions of the solar cycle. [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/524352 Yeates, Nandy and Mackay (2008)] and [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/761/1/L13 Karak and Nandy (2012)], in particular, utilized stochastically forced non-linear solar dynamo simulations to establish that the solar cycle memory is short, lasting over one cycle, thus implying accurate predictions are possible only for the next sunspot cycle and not beyond. This postulate of a short one cycle memory in the solar dynamo mechanism was later observationally verified by [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/767/2/L25 Mu\u00f1oz-Jaramillo et al. (2013)].\n\nAlthough the [[tachocline]] has long been thought to be the key to generating the Sun's large-scale magnetic field, recent research has questioned this assumption.  Radio observations of [[brown dwarfs]] have indicated that they also maintain large-scale magnetic fields and may display cycles of magnetic activity.  The Sun has a radiative core surrounded by a convective envelope, and at the boundary of these two is the [[tachocline]].  However, brown dwarfs lack radiative cores and tachoclines.  Their structure consists of a solar-like convective envelope that exists from core to surface.  Since they lack a [[tachocline]] yet still display solar-like magnetic activity, it has been suggested that solar magnetic activity is only generated in the convective envelope.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Route|first1=Matthew|title=The Discovery of Solar-like Activity Cycles Beyond the End of the Main Sequence?|journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters|date=October 20, 2016|volume=830|issue=2|page=27|doi=10.3847/2041-8205/830/2/L27|arxiv=1609.07761|bibcode=2016ApJ...830L..27R}}</ref>\n\n==Speculated influence of the planets==\nIt has long been theorized that the planets may have an influence on the solar cycle, with many speculative papers published through years.

The Library was part of a larger research institution called the [[Musaeum|Mouseion]], which was dedicated to the [[Muse]]s, the nine goddesses of the arts.<ref name=\":0\">Murray, S. A., (2009). The library: An illustrated history. New York: Skyhorse Publishing, p.17</ref> The idea of a universal library in Alexandria may have been proposed by [[Demetrius of Phalerum]], an exiled Athenian statesman living in Alexandria, to [[Ptolemy I Soter]], who may have established plans for the Library, but the Library itself was probably not built until the reign of his son [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]]. The Library quickly acquired many [[papyrus]] [[scroll]]s, due largely to the Ptolemaic kings' aggressive and well-funded policies for procuring texts. It is unknown precisely how many such scrolls were housed at any given time, but estimates range from 40,000 to 400,000 at its height.\n\nAlexandria came to be regarded as the capital of knowledge and learning, in part because of the Great Library.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The library : an illustrated history|last=Murray|first=Stuart|date=2009|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]]|isbn=978-1-61608-453-0|location=New York, NY|pages= 17|oclc=277203534}}</ref> Many important and influential scholars worked at the Library during the third and second centuries BC, including, among many others: [[Zenodotus of Ephesus]], who worked towards standardizing the texts of the [[Homeric poems]]; [[Callimachus]], who wrote the ''[[Pinakes]]'', sometimes considered to be the world's first [[library catalogue]]; [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], who composed the epic poem the ''[[Argonautica]]''; [[Eratosthenes of Cyrene]], who calculated the [[circumference of the earth]] within a few hundred kilometers of accuracy; [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]], who invented the system of [[Greek diacritics]] and was the first to divide poetic texts into lines; and [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]], who produced the definitive texts of the Homeric poems as well as extensive commentaries on them. During the reign of [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]], a daughter library was established in the [[Serapeum of Alexandria|Serapeum]], a temple to the Greco-Egyptian god [[Serapis]].\n\nDespite the widespread modern belief that the Library of Alexandria was burned once and cataclysmically destroyed, the Library actually declined gradually over the course of several centuries, starting with the purging of intellectuals from Alexandria in 145 BC during the reign of [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon]], which resulted in Aristarchus of Samothrace, the head librarian, resigning from his position and exiling himself to [[Cyprus]]. Many other scholars, including [[Dionysius Thrax]] and [[Apollodorus of Athens]], fled to other cities, where they continued teaching and conducting scholarship. The Library, or part of its collection, was accidentally burned by [[Julius Caesar]] during [[Caesar's Civil War|his civil war]] in 48 BC, but it is unclear how much was actually destroyed and it seems to have either survived or been rebuilt shortly thereafter; the geographer [[Strabo]] mentions having visited the Mouseion in around 20 BC and the prodigious scholarly output of [[Didymus Chalcenterus]] in Alexandria from this period indicates that he had access to at least some of the Library's resources.\n\nThe Library dwindled during the Roman Period, due to lack of funding and support. Its membership appears to have ceased by the 260s AD. Between 270 and 275 AD, the city of Alexandria saw a rebellion and an imperial counterattack that probably destroyed whatever remained of the Library, if it still existed at that time. The daughter library of the Serapeum may have survived after the main Library's destruction. The Serapeum was vandalized and demolished in 391 AD under a decree issued by [[Coptic Christian]] [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria]], but it does not seem to have housed books at the time and was mainly used as a gathering place for [[Neoplatonist]] philosophers following the teachings of [[Iamblichus]].\n\n== Historical background ==\n{{multiple image|align=right\n|image1=Ptolemy I Soter

Tracy, however, argues that it is highly probable that Demetrius played an important role in collecting at least some of the earliest texts that would later become part of the Library's collection.{{sfn|Tracy|2000|pages=343\u2013344}} In around 295 BC or thereabouts, Demetrius may have acquired early texts of the writings of Aristotle and [[Theophrastus]], which he would have been uniquely positioned to do, since he was a distinguished member of the [[Peripatetic school]].{{sfn|Tracy|2000|pages=344\u2013345}}\n\nThe Library was built in the Brucheion (Royal Quarter) as part of the [[Musaeum|Mouseion]].{{sfn|Wiegand|Davis|2015|p=19}}{{efn|\"Mouseion\" means \"House of Muses\", whence the term \"museum\".<ref>Entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2368883 \u039c\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03bd] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912160936/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2368883 |date=12 September 2007 }} at [[Liddell & Scott]].</ref>}} Its main purpose was to show off the wealth of Egypt, with research as a lesser goal,<ref name=\"Lindberg1980\">{{cite book|author=David C.

large, circular dining hall with a high domed ceiling in which they ate meals communally.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}} There were also numerous classrooms, where the scholars were expected to at least occasionally teach students.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}} Ptolemy II Philadelphus is said to have had a keen interest in zoology, so it has been speculated that the Mouseion may have even had a zoo for exotic animals.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}} According to classical scholar [[Lionel Casson]], the idea was that if the scholars were completely freed from all the burdens of everyday life they would be able to devote more time to research and intellectual pursuits.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=34}} Strabo called the group of scholars who lived at the Mouseion a [[:wikt:\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2|\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2]] ({{lang|grc-Latn|synodos}}, \"community\").{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}} As early as 283 BC, they may have numbered between thirty and fifty learned men.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}}\n\n=== Early scholarship ===\nThe Library of Alexandria was not affiliated with any particular philosophical school and, consequently, scholars who studied there had considerable academic freedom.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} They were, however, subject to the authority of the king.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} A probably apocryphal story is told of a poet named [[Sotades]] who wrote an obscene epigram making fun of Ptolemy II for marrying his sister [[Arsinoe II]].{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} Ptolemy II is said to have jailed him and, after he escaped, sealed him in a lead jar and dropped him into the sea.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} As a religious center, the Mouseion was directed by a priest of the Muses known as an ''epistates'', who was appointed by the king in the same manner as the priests who managed the various [[Egyptian temples]].{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=3\u20134}} The Library itself was directed by a scholar who served as [[:Category:Librarians of Alexandria|head librarian]], as well as tutor to the king's son.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}}{{sfn|Staikos|2000|page=66}}{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}}\n\nThe first recorded head librarian was [[Zenodotus of Ephesus]] (lived {{circa}} 325\u2013{{circa}} 270 BC).{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Zenodotus's main work was devoted to the establishment of canonical texts for the Homeric poems and the early Greek lyric poets.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Most of what is known about him comes from later commentaries that mention his preferred readings of particular passages.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} Zenodotus is known to have written a glossary of rare and unusual words, which was organized in [[alphabetical order]], making him the first person known to have employed alphabetical order as a method of organization.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Since the collection at the Library of Alexandria seems to have been organized in alphabetical order by the first letter of the author's name from very early, Casson concludes that it is highly probable that Zenodotus was the one who organized it in this way.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Zenodotus's system of alphabetization, however, only used the first letter of the word{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} and it was not until the second century AD that anyone is known to have applied the same method of alphabetization to the remaining letters of the word.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}}\n\nMeanwhile, the scholar and poet [[Callimachus]] compiled the ''[[Pinakes]]'', a 120-book catalogue of various authors and all their known works.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Staikos|2000|page=66}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} The ''Pinakes'' has not survived, but enough references to it and fragments of it have survived to allow scholars to reconstruct its basic structure.{{sfn|Casson|2001|pages=39\u201340}} The ''Pinakes'' was divided into multiple sections, each containing entries for writers of a particular genre of literature.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|pages=39\u201340}} The most basic division was between writers of poetry and prose, with each section divided into smaller subsections.{{sfn|Casson|2001|pages=39\u201340}} Each section listed authors in alphabetical order.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=40}} Each entry included the author's name, father's name, place of birth, and other brief biographical information, sometimes including nicknames by which that author was known, followed by a complete list of all that author's known works.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=40}} The entries for prolific authors such as [[Aeschylus]], [[Euripides]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Theophrastus]] must have been extremely long, spanning multiple columns of text.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=40}} Although Callimachus did his most famous work at the Library of Alexandria, he never held the position of head librarian there.{{sfn|Staikos|2000|page=66}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} Callimachus's pupil [[Hermippus of Smyrna]] wrote biographies, [[Philostephanus of Cyrene]] studied geography, and [[Istros the Callimachean|Istros]] (who may have also been from Cyrene) studied Attic antiquities.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=109}} In addition to the Great Library, many other smaller libraries also began to spring up all around the city of Alexandria.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}}\n\n[[File:Archimedes-screw one-screw-threads with-ball 3D-view animated small.gif|thumb|According to legend, the Syracusan inventor [[Archimedes]] invented the [[Archimedes' screw]], a pump for transporting water, while studying at the Library of Alexandria.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}}]]\n\nAfter Zenodotus either died or retired, Ptolemy II Philadelphus appointed [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] (lived {{circa}} 295\u2013{{circa}} 215 BC), a native of Alexandria and a student of Callimachus, as the second head librarian of the Library of Alexandria.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=109}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} Philadelphus also appointed Apollonius of Rhodes as the tutor to his son, the future [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]].{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=109}} Apollonius of Rhodes is best known as the author of the ''[[Argonautica]]'', an epic poem about the voyages of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]], which has survived to the present in its complete form.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=110}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} The ''Argonautica'' displays Apollonius's vast knowledge of history and literature and makes allusions to a vast array of events and texts, while simultaneously imitating the style of the Homeric poems.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=110}} Some fragments of his scholarly writings have also survived, but he is generally more famous today as a poet than as a scholar.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}\n\nAccording to legend, during the librarianship of Apollonius, the mathematician and inventor [[Archimedes]] (lived {{circa}}\u2009287 \u2013{{circa}}\u2009212 BC) came to visit the Library of Alexandria.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} During his time in Egypt, Archimedes is said to have observed the rise and fall of the [[Nile]], leading him to invent the [[Archimedes' screw]], which can be used to transport water from low-lying bodies into irrigation ditches.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} Archimedes later returned to Syracuse, where he continued making new inventions.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}}\n\nAccording to two late and largely unreliable biographies, Apollonius was forced to resign from his position as head librarian and moved to the island of Rhodes (after which he takes his name) on account of the hostile reception he received in Alexandria to the first draft of his ''Argonautica''.{{sfn|Montana|2015|pages=109\u2013110}} It is more likely that Apollonius's resignation was on account of Ptolemy III Euergetes's ascension to the throne in 246 BC.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=110}}\n\n=== Later scholarship and expansion ===\n[[File:Eratosthenes_measure_of_Earth_circumference.svg|thumb|300px|right|Illustration showing a portion of the globe

This detail arises from the fact that Alexandria was a man-made bidirectional port between the mainland and the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria|Pharos]] island, welcoming trade from the East and West, and soon found itself to be an international hub for trade, the leading producer of papyrus and, soon enough, books.{{sfn|Trumble|MacIntyre Marshall|2003}} As the Library expanded, it ran out of space to house the scrolls in its collection, so, during the reign of Ptolemy III Euergetes, it opened a satellite collection in the [[Serapeum of Alexandria]], a temple to the Greco-Egyptian god [[Serapis]]

history.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=118}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=7}} During this phase of the Library's history, [[literary criticism]] reached its peak{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=118}} and came to dominate the Library's scholarly output.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=7\u20138}} Aristophanes of Byzantium edited poetic texts and introduced the division of poems into separate lines on the page, since they had previously been written out just like prose.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5, 93}} He also invented the system of [[Greek diacritics]],{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5, 92\u201393}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=7}} wrote important works on [[lexicography]],{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} and introduced a series of signs for textual criticism.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=93}} He wrote introductions to many plays, some of which have survived in partially rewritten forms.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} The fifth head librarian was an obscure

medicine.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=117}} However, it was also during the early second century BC that the political power of Ptolemaic Egypt began to decline.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}} After the [[Battle of Raphia]] in 217 BC, Ptolemaic power became increasingly unstable.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}} There were uprisings among segments of the Egyptian population and, in the first half of the second century BC, connection with [[Upper Egypt]] became largely disrupted.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}} Ptolemaic rulers also began to emphasize the Egyptian aspect of their nation over the Greek aspect.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}} Consequently, many Greek scholars began to leave Alexandria for safer countries with more generous patronages.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}}\n\n[[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] (lived {{circa}} 216\u2013{{circa}} 145 BC) was the sixth head librarian.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} He earned a reputation as the greatest of all ancient scholars and produced not only texts of classic poems and works of prose, but full ''[[hypomnema]]ta'', or long, free-standing commentaries, on them.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} These commentaries would typically cite a passage of a classical text, explain its meaning, define any unusual words used in it, and comment on whether the words in the passage were really those used by the original author or if they were later interpolations added by scribes.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=43}} He made many contributions to a variety of studies, but particularly the study of the Homeric poems,{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} and his editorial opinions are widely quoted by ancient authors as authoritative.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} A portion of one of

Aristarchus became caught up in a dynastic struggle in which he supported [[Ptolemy VII Neos Philopator]] as the ruler of Egypt.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=130}} Ptolemy VII was murdered and succeeded by [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon]], who immediately set about punishing all those who had supported his predecessor, forcing Aristarchus to flee Egypt and take refuge on the island of [[Cyprus]], where he died shortly thereafter.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=130}}{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} Ptolemy VIII expelled all foreign scholars from Alexandria, forcing them to disperse across the Eastern

research and write treatises, but most of them no longer did so in association with the Library.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5\u20136}} A [[diaspora]] of Alexandrian scholarship occurred, in which scholars dispersed first throughout the eastern Mediterranean and later throughout the western Mediterranean as well.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5\u20136}} Aristarchus's student [[Dionysius Thrax]] ({{circa}}

twelfth century AD.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=45}} The Romans based their grammatical writings on it, and its basic format remains the basis for grammar guides in many languages even today.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=45}} Another one of Aristarchus's pupils, [[Apollodorus of Athens]] ({{circa}} 180\u2013{{circa}} 110 BC), went to Alexandria's greatest rival, Pergamum, where he taught

alike.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=373}}\n\nMeanwhile, in Alexandria, from the middle of the second century BC onwards, Ptolemaic rule in Egypt grew less stable than it had been previously.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Confronted with growing social unrest and other major political and economic problems, the later Ptolemies did not devote as much attention towards the Library and the Mouseion as their predecessors had.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} The status of both the Library and the head librarian diminished.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Several of the later Ptolemies used the position of head librarian as a mere political plum to reward their most devoted supporters.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Ptolemy VIII appointed a man named Cydas, one of his palace guards, as head librarian{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=149}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} and [[Ptolemy IX Lathyros|Ptolemy IX Soter II]] (ruled 88\u201381 BC) is said to have given the position to a political supporter.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Eventually, the position of head librarian lost so much of its former prestige that even contemporary authors ceased to take interest in recording the terms of office for individual head librarians.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=149}}\n\nA shift in Greek scholarship at large occurred around the beginning of the first century BC.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=351}} By this time, all major classical poetic texts had finally been standardized and extensive commentaries had already been produced on the writings of all the major literary authors of the [[Greek Classical Era]].{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} Consequently, there was little original work left for scholars to do with these texts.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} Many scholars began producing syntheses and reworkings of the commentaries of the Alexandrian scholars of previous centuries, at the expense of their own originalities.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=351}}{{efn|This shift paralleled a similar, concurrent trend in philosophy, in which many philosophers were beginning to synthesize the views of earlier philosophers rather than coming up with original ideas of their own.{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=351}}}} Other scholars branched out and began writing commentaries on the poetic works of postclassical authors, including Alexandrian poets such as Callimachus and Apollonius of Rhodes.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} Meanwhile, Alexandrian scholarship was probably introduced to [[Rome]] in the

It is unknown precisely how many such scrolls were housed at any given time, but estimates range from 40,000 to 400,000 at its height.\n\nAlexandria came to be regarded as the capital of knowledge and learning, in part because of the Great Library.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The library : an illustrated history|last=Murray|first=Stuart|date=2009|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]]|isbn=978-1-61608-453-0|location=New York, NY|pages= 17|oclc=277203534}}</ref> Many important and influential scholars worked at the Library during the third and second centuries BC, including, among many others: [[Zenodotus of Ephesus]], who worked towards standardizing the texts of the [[Homeric poems]]; [[Callimachus]], who wrote the ''[[Pinakes]]'', sometimes considered to be the world's first [[library catalogue]]; [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], who composed the epic poem the ''[[Argonautica]]''; [[Eratosthenes of Cyrene]], who calculated the [[circumference of the earth]] within a few hundred kilometers of accuracy; [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]], who invented the system of [[Greek diacritics]] and was the first to divide poetic texts into lines; and [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]], who produced the definitive texts of the Homeric poems as well as extensive commentaries on them. During the reign of [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]], a daughter library was established in the [[Serapeum of Alexandria|Serapeum]], a temple to the Greco-Egyptian god [[Serapis]].\n\nDespite the widespread modern belief that the Library of Alexandria was burned once and cataclysmically destroyed, the Library actually declined gradually over the course of several centuries, starting with the purging of intellectuals from Alexandria in 145 BC during the reign of [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon]], which resulted in Aristarchus of Samothrace, the head librarian, resigning from his position and exiling himself to [[Cyprus]]. Many other scholars, including [[Dionysius Thrax]] and [[Apollodorus of Athens]], fled to other cities, where they continued teaching and conducting scholarship. The Library, or part of its collection, was accidentally burned by [[Julius Caesar]] during [[Caesar's Civil War|his civil war]] in 48 BC, but it is unclear how much was actually destroyed and it seems to have either survived or been rebuilt shortly thereafter; the geographer [[Strabo]] mentions having visited the Mouseion in around 20 BC and the prodigious scholarly output of [[Didymus Chalcenterus]] in Alexandria from this period indicates that he had access to at least some of the Library's resources.\n\nThe Library dwindled during the Roman Period, due to lack of funding and support. Its membership appears to have ceased by the 260s AD. Between 270 and 275 AD, the city of Alexandria saw a rebellion and an imperial counterattack that probably destroyed whatever remained of the Library, if it still existed at that time. The daughter library of the Serapeum may have survived after the main Library's destruction. The Serapeum was vandalized and demolished in 391 AD under a decree issued by [[Coptic Christian]] [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria]], but it does not seem to have housed books at the time and was mainly used as a gathering place for [[Neoplatonist]] philosophers following the teachings of [[Iamblichus]].\n\n== Historical background ==\n{{multiple image|align=right\n|image1=Ptolemy I Soter

the groundwork for the Library, it probably did not come into being as a physical institution until the reign of Ptolemy II.{{sfn|Tracy|2000|page=343}} By that time, Demetrius of Phalerum had fallen

occasionally teach students.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}} Ptolemy II Philadelphus is said to have had a keen interest in zoology, so it has been speculated that the Mouseion may have even had a zoo for exotic animals.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}} According to classical scholar [[Lionel Casson]], the idea was that if the scholars were completely freed from all the burdens of everyday life they would be able to devote more time to research and intellectual pursuits.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=34}} Strabo called the group of scholars who lived at the Mouseion a

numbered between thirty and fifty learned men.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}}\n\n=== Early scholarship ===\nThe Library of Alexandria was not affiliated with any particular philosophical school and, consequently, scholars who studied there had considerable academic freedom.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} They were, however, subject to the authority of the king.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} A probably apocryphal story is told of a poet named [[Sotades]] who wrote an obscene epigram making fun of Ptolemy II for marrying his sister [[Arsinoe II]].{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} Ptolemy II is said to have jailed him and, after he escaped, sealed him in a lead jar and dropped him into the sea.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} As a religious center, the Mouseion was directed by a priest of the Muses known as an ''epistates'', who was appointed by the king in the same manner as the priests who managed the various [[Egyptian temples]].{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=3\u20134}} The Library itself was directed by a scholar who served as [[:Category:Librarians of Alexandria|head librarian]], as well as tutor to the king's

325\u2013{{circa}} 270 BC).{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Zenodotus's main work was devoted to the establishment of canonical texts for the Homeric poems and the early Greek lyric poets.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Most of what is known about him comes from later commentaries that mention his preferred readings of particular passages.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} Zenodotus is known to have written a glossary of rare and unusual words, which was organized in [[alphabetical order]], making him the first person known to have employed alphabetical order as a method of organization.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Since the collection at the Library of Alexandria seems to have been organized in alphabetical order by the first letter of the author's name from very early, Casson concludes that it is highly probable that Zenodotus was the one who organized it in this way.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Zenodotus's system of alphabetization, however, only used the first letter of the word{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} and it was not until the second century AD that anyone is known to have applied the same method of alphabetization to the remaining letters of the word.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}}\n\nMeanwhile, the scholar and poet [[Callimachus]] compiled the ''[[Pinakes]]'', a 120-book catalogue of various authors and all their known works.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Staikos|2000|page=66}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} The ''Pinakes'' has not survived, but enough references to it and fragments of it have survived to allow scholars to reconstruct its basic structure.{{sfn|Casson|2001|pages=39\u201340}} The ''Pinakes'' was divided into multiple sections, each containing entries for writers of a particular genre of literature.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|pages=39\u201340}} The most basic division was between writers of poetry and prose, with each section divided into smaller subsections.{{sfn|Casson|2001|pages=39\u201340}} Each section listed authors in alphabetical order.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=40}} Each entry included the author's name, father's name, place of birth, and other brief biographical information, sometimes including nicknames by which that author was known, followed by a complete list of all that author's known works.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=40}} The entries for prolific authors such as [[Aeschylus]], [[Euripides]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Theophrastus]] must have been extremely long, spanning multiple columns of text.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=40}} Although Callimachus did his most famous work at the Library of Alexandria, he never held the position of head librarian there.{{sfn|Staikos|2000|page=66}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} Callimachus's pupil [[Hermippus of Smyrna]] wrote biographies, [[Philostephanus of Cyrene]] studied geography, and [[Istros the Callimachean|Istros]] (who may have also been from Cyrene) studied Attic antiquities.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=109}} In addition to the Great Library, many other smaller libraries also began to spring up all around the city of

appointed [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] (lived {{circa}} 295\u2013{{circa}} 215 BC), a native of Alexandria and a student of Callimachus, as the second head librarian of the Library of Alexandria.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=109}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} Philadelphus also appointed Apollonius of Rhodes as the tutor to his son, the future [[Ptolemy III

survived to the present in its complete form.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=110}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} The ''Argonautica'' displays Apollonius's vast knowledge of history and literature and makes allusions to a vast array of events and texts, while simultaneously imitating the style of the Homeric poems.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=110}} Some fragments of his scholarly writings have also survived, but he is generally more famous today as a poet than as a scholar.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}\n\nAccording to legend, during the librarianship of Apollonius, the mathematician and inventor [[Archimedes]] (lived {{circa}}\u2009287 \u2013{{circa}}\u2009212 BC) came to visit the Library of Alexandria.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} During his time in Egypt, Archimedes is said to have observed the rise and fall of the [[Nile]], leading him to invent the [[Archimedes' screw]], which can be used to transport water from low-lying bodies into irrigation ditches.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} Archimedes later returned to Syracuse, where he continued making new inventions.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}}\n\nAccording to two late and largely unreliable biographies, Apollonius was forced to resign from his position as head librarian and moved to the island of Rhodes (after which he takes his name) on account of the hostile reception he received in Alexandria to the first draft of his ''Argonautica''.{{sfn|Montana|2015|pages=109\u2013110}} It is more likely that Apollonius's resignation was on account of Ptolemy III Euergetes's ascension to the throne in 246 BC.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=110}}\n\n=== Later scholarship and expansion ===\n[[File:Eratosthenes_measure_of_Earth_circumference.svg|thumb|300px|right|Illustration showing a portion of the globe

twelfth century AD.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=45}} The Romans based their grammatical writings on it, and its basic format remains the basis for grammar guides in many languages even today.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=45}} Another one of Aristarchus's pupils, [[Apollodorus of Athens]] ({{circa}} 180\u2013{{circa}} 110 BC), went to Alexandria's greatest rival, Pergamum, where he taught and conducted research.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} This diaspora prompted the historian Menecles of Barce to sarcastically comment that Alexandria had become the teacher of all Greeks and barbarians alike.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=373}}\n\nMeanwhile, in Alexandria, from the middle of the second century BC onwards, Ptolemaic rule in Egypt grew less stable than it had been previously.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Confronted with growing social unrest and other major political and economic problems, the later Ptolemies did not devote as much attention towards the Library and the Mouseion as their predecessors had.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} The status of both the Library and the head librarian diminished.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Several of the later Ptolemies used the position of head librarian as a mere political plum to reward their most devoted supporters.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Ptolemy VIII appointed a man named Cydas, one of his palace guards, as head librarian{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=149}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} and [[Ptolemy IX Lathyros|Ptolemy IX Soter II]] (ruled 88\u201381 BC) is said to have given the position to a political supporter.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Eventually, the position of head librarian lost so much of its former prestige that even contemporary authors ceased to take interest in recording the terms of office for individual head librarians.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=149}}\n\nA shift in Greek scholarship at large occurred around the beginning of the first century BC.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=351}} By this time, all major classical poetic texts had finally been standardized and extensive commentaries had already been produced on the writings of all the major literary authors of the [[Greek Classical Era]].{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} Consequently, there was little original work left for scholars to do with these texts.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} Many scholars began producing syntheses and reworkings of the commentaries of the Alexandrian scholars of previous centuries, at the expense of their own originalities.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=351}}{{efn|This shift paralleled a similar, concurrent trend in philosophy, in which many philosophers were beginning to synthesize the

postclassical authors, including Alexandrian poets such as Callimachus and Apollonius of Rhodes.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} Meanwhile, Alexandrian scholarship was probably introduced to [[Rome]] in the
