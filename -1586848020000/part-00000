A total of 21 women competed in this event, limited to [[j\u016bd\u014dka]] with a body weight of less than 78 kilograms.\nPreliminary rounds started at 12:00 Noon [[China Standard Time|CST]]. [[Repechage]] finals, semifinals, bouts for bronze medals and the final were held at 18:00pm CST.\n\nThis event was the second-heaviest of the women's judo weight classes, limiting competitors to a maximum of 78 kilograms of body mass. Like all other judo events, bouts lasted five minutes. If the bout was still tied at the end, it was extended for another five-minute, sudden-death period; if neither judoka scored during that period, the match is decided by the judges. The tournament bracket consisted of a single-elimination contest culminating in a gold medal match. There was also a repechage to determine the winners of the two bronze medals. Each judoka who had lost to a semifinalist competed in the repechage. The two judokas who lost in the semifinals faced the winner of the opposite half of the bracket's repechage in bronze medal bouts.\n\n==Qualifying athletes==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

He graduated from [[Choctawhatchee High School]] in [[Fort Walton Beach, Florida]], in 1964; he received a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[Engineering Science]] with a major in Astronautical Engineering from the [[United States Air Force Academy]] in 1968, and a [[Master of Science]] degree in [[Aeronautics]] and [[Astronautics]] from [[Purdue University]] in 1969.\n\n==Military career==\nAs a member of the [[U.S. Air Force]], Covey was an operational [[fighter pilot]] from 1970\u20131974, flying the [[F-100 Super Sabre]], [[A-37 Dragonfly]] and [[A-7 Corsair II]]. He flew 339 [[Aerial warfare|combat mission]]s during two tours in [[Southeast Asia]]. At [[Eglin Air Force Base]], [[Florida]], between 1975 and 1978, he was an [[F-4 Phantom II]] and [[A-7D]] weapons system [[test pilot]] and joint test force director for [[electronic warfare]] testing of the [[F-15 Eagle]].\n\nHe has flown over 5,700 hours in more than 30 different types of aircraft.\n\n==NASA career==\nSelected as an astronaut candidate by [[NASA]] in January 1978, Covey became an astronaut in August 1979. A veteran of four space flights, [[STS-51-I]] in 1985, [[STS-26]] in 1988, [[STS-38]] in 1990, and [[STS-61]] in 1993, Covey has logged over 646 hours in [[Outer space|space]]. \n\nPrior to the first flight of the [[Space Shuttle]], he provided astronaut support in [[Space Shuttle orbiter|Orbiter]] engineering development and testing. He was a [[T-38 Talon|T-38]] [[Chase plane|chase pilot]] for the second and third Shuttle flights and support crewman for the first operational Shuttle flight, [[STS-5]]. Covey also served as Mission Control spacecraft communicator ([[Capsule communicator|CAPCOM]]) for Shuttle Missions STS-5, [[STS-6|6]], [[STS-61-B|61-B]], [[STS-61-C|61-C]], and [[STS-51-L|51-L]] (it was his voice that said the now infamous words, \"[[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']], go at throttle up\" shortly before the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]]). During 1989, he was Chairman of NASA's Space Flight Safety Panel. He has held additional technical assignments within the NASA [[Astronaut Office]], and has also served as Acting Deputy Chief of the Astronaut Office, and Acting Deputy Director of Flight Crew Operations.\n\n===Space flights===\nOn his first mission, Covey was the Pilot on the five-man crew of [[STS-51-I]], which launched from [[Kennedy Space Center]], Florida, on August 27, 1985. During this seven-day mission, crew members deployed three communications satellites: the Navy [[Syncom|SYNCOM IV-4]], the Australian [[Optus fleet of satellites|AUSSAT]], and [[American Satellite Corporation|American Satellite Corporation's]] [[ASC-1]]. The crew also performed the successful on-orbit rendezvous and repair of the ailing 15,000 pound (6.8 t) SYNCOM IV-3 satellite. This repair activity involved the first manual grapple and manual deployment of a satellite by a spacewalking crew member. Mission duration was 170 hours. The [[Space Shuttle Discovery|Space Shuttle ''Discovery'']] completed 112 orbits of the [[Earth]] before landing at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], [[California]], on September 3, 1985.\n\nHe next served as Pilot on [[STS-26]], the first flight to be flown after the Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster. The five-man crew launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]], Florida, on September 29, 1988, aboard the Space Shuttle ''Discovery''. Mission duration was 97 hours during which crew members successfully deployed the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite|TDRS-C]] satellite and operated eleven secondary payloads which included two student experiments. ''Discovery'' completed 64 orbits of the Earth before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on October 3, 1988.\n\nOn [[STS-38]] Covey was the spacecraft commander of a five-man crew which launched at night from the [[Kennedy Space Center]], Florida, on November 15, 1990. During the five-day mission crew members conducted [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] operations. After 80 orbits of the Earth in 117 hours, Covey piloted the [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Space Shuttle ''Atlantis'']] to a landing on the runway at the Kennedy Space Center on November 20, 1990. This was the first Shuttle recovery in Florida since 1985.\n\nOn his fourth flight, Covey commanded a crew of seven aboard the [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'']] on the [[STS-61]] [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST) servicing and repair mission. STS-61 launched at night from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on December 2, 1993. During the 11-day flight, the HST was captured and restored to full capacity through a record five [[space walk]]s by four astronauts. After having traveled 4,433,772 miles (7,135,464&nbsp;km) in 163 orbits of the Earth, Covey landed the ''Endeavour'' at night on the runway at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] on December 13, 1993.\n\n==Post-NASA career==\nOn August 1, 1994, Covey retired from NASA and the Air Force. Covey is married and has two grown daughters.  After the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster]] in 2003, Covey, along with retired Air Force [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Thomas Patten Stafford]], headed the Stafford-Covey Commission in returning the Space Shuttle fleet to space, starting with the [[STS-114]] mission.  In 2005, Covey received the [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]] from the [[Boy Scouts of America]]\u2014he became an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] in 1960 when his father was stationed at an Air Force base in California. Covey was featured in a 2005 issue of ''Eagletter'', a magazine for members of the [[National Eagle Scout Association]].  In January 2006, Covey was selected for the position of [[Chief Operating Officer]] of [[United Space Alliance]]. As of September 28, 2007, Covey has succeeded fellow astronaut [[Michael J. McCulley]] as [[Chief Executive Officer]] of United Space Alliance.\n\n==Special honors==\nCovey has been awarded the [[Defense Distinguished Service Medal]], the [[Defense Superior Service Medal]], 5 [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Air Force Distinguished Flying Crosses]], 16 [[Air Medal]]s, the [[Meritorious Service Medal (United States)|Air Force Meritorious Service Medal]], the [[Air Force Commendation Medal]], the [[National Intelligence Medal of Achievement]], the [[NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal]], the [[NASA Exceptional Service Medal]], 4 [[NASA Space Flight Medal]]s, the [[Johnson Space Center]] Certificate of Commendation, the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] (AIAA) [[Andrew G. Haley|Haley]] Space Flight Award for 1988, and the [[American Astronautical Society]] (AAS) Flight Achievement Award for 1988. He is a Distinguished Graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy, received the Liethen-Tittle Award as the Outstanding Graduate of [[U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School]] Class 74B, and is a Distinguished Astronaut Engineering Alumnus of Purdue University.\n\nArkansas Aviation Historical Society inducted Covey into the [[Arkansas Aviation Historical Society|Arkansas Aviation Hall of Fame]] in 1995.<ref name=\"Arkansas Aviation Historical Society Collection\">{{cite web |url=http://cdm15728.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/findingaids/id/3529 |title= Arkansas Aviation Historical Society Collection |work= Butler Center for Arkansas Studies}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/covey-ro.html Covey's official NASA biography]\n* [http://www.spacefacts.de/bios/astronauts/english/covey_richard.htm Spacefacts biography of Richard O.

In the absence of external fields,\nthe potential <math>V</math> should not depend on the absolute position of\natoms, but only on the relative positions. This means\nthat the functional form can be rewritten as a function\nof interatomic distances <math>\\textstyle r_{ij} = |\\vec r_i-\\vec r_j|</math>\nand angles between the bonds\n(vectors to neighbours) <math>\\textstyle \\theta_{ijk}</math>.\nThen, in the absence of external forces, the general\nform becomes\n\n::<math>\n\tV_\\mathrm{TOT} =  \\sum_{i,j}^N V_2(r_{ij}) + \\sum_{i,j,k}^N V_3(r_{ij},r_{ik},\\theta_{ijk}) + \\cdots\n</math>\n\nIn the three-body term <math>\\textstyle V_3</math> the\ninteratomic distance <math>\\textstyle r_{jk}</math> is not needed\nsince the three terms <math>\\textstyle r_{ij},r_{ik},\\theta_{ijk} </math>\nare sufficient to give the relative positions of three atoms <math>i, j, k</math> in three-dimensional space. Any terms of order higher than\n2 are also called ''many-body potentials''.\nIn some interatomic potentials the many-body interactions are \nembedded into the terms of a pair potential (see discussion on\nEAM-like and bond order potentials below).\n\nIn principle the sums in the expressions run over all <math>N</math> atoms.\nHowever, if the range of the interatomic potential is finite,\ni.e. the potentials <math>\\textstyle V(r) \\equiv 0 </math> above\nsome cutoff distance <math>\\textstyle r_\\mathrm{cut}</math>,\nthe summing can be restricted to atoms within the cutoff\ndistance of each other.

Potentials with an infinite\nrange can be summed up efficiently by [[Ewald summation]]\nand its further developments.\n\n== Force calculation ==\n\nThe forces acting between atoms can be obtained by differentiation of\nthe total energy with respect to atom positions.

In the absence of external fields,\nthe potential <math>V</math> should not depend on the absolute position of\natoms, but only on the relative positions. This means\nthat the functional form can be rewritten as a function\nof interatomic distances <math>\\textstyle r_{ij} = |\\vec r_i-\\vec r_j|</math>\nand angles between the bonds\n(vectors to neighbours) <math>\\textstyle \\theta_{ijk}</math>.\nThen, in the absence of external forces, the general\nform becomes\n\n::<math>\n\tV_\\mathrm{TOT} =  \\sum_{i,j}^N V_2(r_{ij}) + \\sum_{i,j,k}^N V_3(r_{ij},r_{ik},\\theta_{ijk}) + \\cdots\n</math>\n\nIn the three-body term <math>\\textstyle V_3</math> the\ninteratomic distance <math>\\textstyle r_{jk}</math> is not needed\nsince the three terms <math>\\textstyle r_{ij},r_{ik},\\theta_{ijk} </math>\nare sufficient to give the relative positions of three atoms <math>i, j, k</math> in three-dimensional space. Any terms of order higher than\n2 are also called ''many-body potentials''.\nIn some interatomic potentials the many-body interactions are \nembedded into the terms of a pair potential (see discussion on\nEAM-like and bond order potentials below).\n\nIn principle the sums in the expressions run over all <math>N</math> atoms.\nHowever, if the range of the interatomic potential is finite,\ni.e. the potentials <math>\\textstyle V(r) \\equiv 0 </math> above\nsome cutoff distance <math>\\textstyle r_\\mathrm{cut}</math>,\nthe summing can be restricted to atoms within the cutoff\ndistance of each other.

[[Walter W. Stone]], book publisher (Wentworth Books) and passionate supporter of Australian literature, was also born in Orange. The first [[Australian Touring Car Championship]], known today as [[V8 Supercar|V8 Supercar Championship Series]], was held at the [[Gnoo Blas Motor Racing Circuit]] in [[1960 Australian Touring Car Championship|1960]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Graham Howard & Stewart Wilson |title=Australian Touring Car Championship, 25 Fabulous Years |year=1986 |publisher=R&T Publishing |location=Gordon, NSW |isbn=0-9590378-2-9 |pages=14\u201326 |chapter=1960: Let the race begin}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Orange, 1929 (8208833593).jpg|thumb|Summer Street in 1929]]\nIn 1822 Captain Percy Simpson marched into the Wellington District and established a convict settlement which was called \"Blackman's Swamp\" after James Blackman; Simpson had employed James Blackman as a guide because he had already accompanied an earlier explorer, [[John Oxley]] into that region.<ref name=adb>{{cite web|last=Greaves|first=Bernard|title=Blackman, James (1792\u20131868)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/blackman-james-1790|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1820s, the surveyor J. B. Richards worked on a survey of the [[Macquarie River (New South Wales)|Macquarie River]] below [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] and also of the road to [[Wellington, New South Wales|Wellington]]. On a plan dated 1829, he indicated a village reserve, in the parish of Orange. [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Sir Thomas Mitchell]] named the parish Orange, as he had been an associate of the [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]] in the [[Peninsular War]], when both were [[aide-de-camp|aides-de-camp]] to the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], whose title was bestowed on the valley to the west by Oxley.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55185386 |title=PLACE NAMES. |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]|date=13 May 1964 |accessdate=23 February 2011 |page=61 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nInitial occupation by British graziers began in late 1829, and tiny settlements eventually turned into larger towns as properties came into connection with the road. In 1844, the surveyor Davidson was sent to check on encroachments onto the land reserved for a village, and to advise on the location for a township. His choices were Frederick's Valley, Pretty Plains, or Blackman's Swamp.\n\nBlackman's Swamp was chosen, and it was proclaimed a village and named Orange by Major [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]] in 1846 in honour of [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince William of Orange]]. At nearby [[Ophir, New South Wales|Ophir]], a significant gold find in Australia was made in 1851, resulting in a sporadic population movement which is known as the [[Australian gold rush]]. Additional gold finds in nearby areas led to the establishment of Orange as a central trading centre for the gold.\n\nThe growth of Orange continued as the conditions were well suited for agriculture, and in 1860 it was proclaimed a municipality. The railway from [[Sydney]] reached Orange in 1877. In 1946, 100 years after it was first being established as a village, Orange was proclaimed as a minor city.\n\n==Population==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2018}}\nAccording to the [[Census in Australia#2016|2016 census]] of Population, there were 37,182 people in the Orange urban centre.\n* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 6.6% of the population. \n* 83.2% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 1.6%, India 1.0%, New Zealand 0.9%, Philippines 0.5% and China 0.4%.\n* 87.3% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Malayalam 0.7%, Mandarin 0.4%, Italian 0.3% and Nepali 0.3%. \n* The most common responses for religion were Catholic 30.1%, No Religion 22.0% and Anglican 20.2%.\n* Of the employed people in Orange (Urban Centres and Localities), 6.2% worked in hospitals (except psychiatric hospitals). Other major industries of employment included gold ore mining 4.2%, state government administration 3.4%, other social assistance services 3.2% and supermarket and grocery Stores 2.5%.\n\n==Geography and climate==\nOwing to its altitude, Orange has a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Cfb''), with warm summers (though with cool mornings) and cool winters with frequent morning [[frost]]s and light to moderate, sometimes heavy snowfalls. The city is relatively wet for an inland location owing to orographic effects from Mount Canobolas, especially during the cooler months when snow falls; Orange is amongst the few cities in Australia to receive regular snowfall, and is likewise the snowiest city in Australia (not counting smaller towns such as Oberon). Compared with most population centres in Australia it has colder winters, especially in terms of its daytime maximum temperatures, owing chiefly to its south-westerly exposure. In summer, the average (and absolute) maximum temperatures are also lower than in most inland centres, on account of its elevation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winesoforange.com.au/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=165885|title=Orange Region Terroir|date=2010|work=Wines of Orange}}</ref> Owing to its inland location, the humidity is low in the summer months with the [[dewpoint]] typically around 10&nbsp;\u00b0C.

as [[cherries]], [[peach]]es, [[apricot]]s, and [[plum]]s; oranges are not grown in the area, since its climate is too cool. In recent years, a large number of [[vineyard]]s have been planted in the area for rapidly expanding wine production. The growth of this wine industry, coupled with the further development of Orange as a gourmet food capital, has ensured Orange's status as a prominent tourism destination.\n\nOther large industries include:\n* [[Cadia mine|Cadia gold mine]] is a large open cut gold and copper mine located about 20 kilometres south of Orange. The mine has been developed throughout the 1990s and is a major employer in the region with an expected lifespan of several decades.

The Orange region is good for grape growing and winemaking due to a combination of geology, soils, climate and temperature. Together these factors combine to produce grapes and wine of distinct flavours and colour. The climate perhaps plays the biggest part in giving Orange some distinct natural advantages \u2013 the cool temperatures during most of the growing season coupled with dry autumn conditions are ideal for grape growing.<ref>http://www.winesoforange.com.au/</ref>\n\n===Wineries===\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-break}}\n* Angullong Vineyard\n* Atallah Wines\n* Bloodwood\n* Borrodell on the Mount\n* Brangayne of Orange\n* Canobolas Smith\n* Cargo Road Winery\n* Cooks Lot\n* Colmar Estate\n{{col-break}}\n* Cumulus Estate\n* Dindima\n* De Salis\n* Faisan Estate\n* Habitat Vineyard\n* Heifer Station Vineyard\n* Highland Heritage\n* La Colline\n* Matison Estate\n{{col-break}}\n* Mayfield Vineyard\n* Montoro Wines\n* Moody's\n* Nashdale Lane\n* Orange Mountain Wines\n* Patina\n* Philip Shaw\n* Printhie\n* Ross Hill\n{{col-break}}\n* Rowlee Wines\n* Rikard Wines\n* Sassy Wines\n* Slow Wine Co.\n* Strawhouse Wines\n* Stockman's Ridge\n* Swinging Bridge\n* Turner's Vineyard\n* Word of Mouth Wines\n{{col-end}}\nWineries that use Orange region grapes in their wines include [[Brokenwood Wines]] (Hunter Valley based), Logan (Mudgee), Tamburlaine (Hunter Valley), Gartelmann (Hunter Valley), Windowrie (Central Ranges), Eloquesta Wines (Mudgee) and [[David Lowe (winemaker)|Lowe]] Wines (Mudgee).

Currently Suma Park Dam and Spring Creek Reservoir are used for domestic water consumption. Two other dams, [[Lake Canobolas]] and Gosling Creek Reservoir, were previously used for domestic water consumption; however, they are now used for recreational purposes. The city is currently on Level 5 water restrictions.  Orange City Council is undertaking a number of strategies to supplement its supply, including stormwater harvesting.\n\nThe first batch of harvested stormwater was released into Suma Park Dam on 21 April 2009. The harvested stormwater was tested by Analytical Laboratory Services, an independent laboratory based in Sydney. ALS tested for 90 potential pollutants. The tests revealed that the water quality met all targets. The first batch contained 14 megalitres. It is believed to be an Australian first for harvesting stormwater for potable use. The hardware is in place, operating rules have been developed and environmental factors and impacts on downstream users have been considered. A three-month trial will ensure all these elements are working together to ensure high water quality and environmental standards are met. There are several phases involved in the commissioning period. The hardware, which includes three separate pumping stations, creek flow monitoring points and advanced electronics including fibre optic cables, will undergo further operating tests. The other elements of the scheme include a weir on Blackmans Swamp Creek, which creates a 3 megalitre pool and the site for the first pump station, a 200 megalitre dam and two 17 megalitre batching ponds. The pumps on the creek transfer stormwater to the 200 megalitre dam at a rate of up to 450 litres per second and are designed to rapidly extract peak storm flows from the creek. The operating rules require that a base flow immediately downstream in the creek must be maintained. The creek flow monitoring points ensure these standards are met. The monitoring station also measures when harvesting can commence. The trigger is flows passing the monitor in Blackmans Swamp Creek exceeding 1000 litres per second.\n\nThe local mine, Cadia-Ridgeway Mine, uses the city's treated effluent to supplement its water supply.\n\nOrange is currently planning to implement a pipeline from the Macquarie river to boost the town water supply. This is hotly debated, and researchers believe that it will endanger threatened wetland areas.<ref>Cubby, Ben, Pipeline plan puts protected wetlands in peril, say researchers [http://www.smh.com.au/environment/pipeline-plan-puts-protected-wetlands-in-peril-say-researchers-20130728-2qsnw.html]</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Roads===\nOrange is situated on the [[Mitchell Highway]], linking the city to [[Molong]], [[Wellington, New South Wales|Wellington]], [[Dubbo]] and [[Bourke, New South Wales|Bourke]] to the north west, and to [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] to the east and from there to Sydney via the Great Western Highway ({{convert|260|km|mi|-1|disp=or|abbr=on}}).

[[Walter W. Stone]], book publisher (Wentworth Books) and passionate supporter of Australian literature, was also born in Orange. The first [[Australian Touring Car Championship]], known today as [[V8 Supercar|V8 Supercar Championship Series]], was held at the [[Gnoo Blas Motor Racing Circuit]] in [[1960 Australian Touring Car Championship|1960]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Graham Howard & Stewart Wilson |title=Australian Touring Car Championship, 25 Fabulous Years |year=1986 |publisher=R&T Publishing |location=Gordon, NSW |isbn=0-9590378-2-9 |pages=14\u201326 |chapter=1960: Let the race begin}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Orange, 1929 (8208833593).jpg|thumb|Summer Street in 1929]]\nIn 1822 Captain Percy Simpson marched into the Wellington District and established a convict settlement which was called \"Blackman's Swamp\" after James Blackman; Simpson had employed James Blackman as a guide because he had already accompanied an earlier explorer, [[John Oxley]] into that region.<ref name=adb>{{cite web|last=Greaves|first=Bernard|title=Blackman, James (1792\u20131868)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/blackman-james-1790|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1820s, the surveyor J. B. Richards worked on a survey of the [[Macquarie River (New South Wales)|Macquarie River]] below [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] and also of the road to [[Wellington, New South Wales|Wellington]]. On a plan dated 1829, he indicated a village reserve, in the parish of Orange. [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Sir Thomas Mitchell]] named the parish Orange, as he had been an associate of the [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]] in the [[Peninsular War]], when both were [[aide-de-camp|aides-de-camp]] to the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], whose title was bestowed on the valley to the west by Oxley.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55185386 |title=PLACE NAMES. |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]|date=13 May 1964 |accessdate=23 February 2011 |page=61 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nInitial occupation by British graziers began in late 1829, and tiny settlements eventually turned into larger towns as properties came into connection with the road. In 1844, the surveyor Davidson was sent to check on encroachments onto the land reserved for a village, and to advise on the location for a township. His choices were Frederick's Valley, Pretty Plains, or Blackman's Swamp.\n\nBlackman's Swamp was chosen, and it was proclaimed a village and named Orange by Major [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]] in 1846 in honour of [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince William of Orange]]. At nearby [[Ophir, New South Wales|Ophir]], a significant gold find in Australia was made in 1851, resulting in a sporadic population movement which is known as the [[Australian gold rush]]. Additional gold finds in nearby areas led to the establishment of Orange as a central trading centre for the gold.\n\nThe growth of Orange continued as the conditions were well suited for agriculture, and in 1860 it was proclaimed a municipality. The railway from [[Sydney]] reached Orange in 1877. In 1946, 100 years after it was first being established as a village, Orange was proclaimed as a minor city.\n\n==Population==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2018}}\nAccording to the [[Census in Australia#2016|2016 census]] of Population, there were 37,182 people in the Orange urban centre.\n* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 6.6% of the population. \n* 83.2% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 1.6%, India 1.0%, New Zealand 0.9%, Philippines 0.5% and China 0.4%.\n* 87.3% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Malayalam 0.7%, Mandarin 0.4%, Italian 0.3% and Nepali 0.3%. \n* The most common responses for religion were Catholic 30.1%, No Religion 22.0% and Anglican 20.2%.\n* Of the employed people in Orange (Urban Centres and Localities), 6.2% worked in hospitals (except psychiatric hospitals). Other major industries of employment included gold ore mining 4.2%, state government administration 3.4%, other social assistance services 3.2% and supermarket and grocery Stores 2.5%.\n\n==Geography and climate==\nOwing to its altitude, Orange has a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Cfb''), with warm summers (though with cool mornings) and cool winters with frequent morning [[frost]]s and light to moderate, sometimes heavy snowfalls. The city is relatively wet for an inland location owing to orographic effects from Mount Canobolas, especially during the cooler months when snow falls; Orange is amongst the few cities in Australia to receive regular snowfall, and is likewise the snowiest city in Australia (not counting smaller towns such as Oberon). Compared with most population centres in Australia it has colder winters, especially in terms of its daytime maximum temperatures, owing chiefly to its south-westerly exposure. In summer, the average (and absolute) maximum temperatures are also lower than in most inland centres, on account of its elevation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winesoforange.com.au/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=165885|title=Orange Region Terroir|date=2010|work=Wines of Orange}}</ref> Owing to its inland location, the humidity is low in the summer months with the [[dewpoint]] typically around 10&nbsp;\u00b0C.

as [[cherries]], [[peach]]es, [[apricot]]s, and [[plum]]s; oranges are not grown in the area, since its climate is too cool. In recent years, a large number of [[vineyard]]s have been planted in the area for rapidly expanding wine production. The growth of this wine industry, coupled with the further development of Orange as a gourmet food capital, has ensured Orange's status as a prominent tourism destination.\n\nOther large industries include:\n* [[Cadia mine|Cadia gold mine]] is a large open cut gold and copper mine located about 20 kilometres south of Orange.

The Orange region is good for grape growing and winemaking due to a combination of geology, soils, climate and temperature. Together these factors combine to produce grapes and wine of distinct flavours and colour. The climate perhaps plays the biggest part in giving Orange some distinct natural advantages \u2013 the cool temperatures during most of the growing season coupled with dry autumn conditions are ideal for grape growing.<ref>http://www.winesoforange.com.au/</ref>\n\n===Wineries===\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-break}}\n* Angullong Vineyard\n* Atallah Wines\n* Bloodwood\n* Borrodell on the Mount\n* Brangayne of Orange\n* Canobolas Smith\n* Cargo Road Winery\n* Cooks Lot\n* Colmar Estate\n{{col-break}}\n* Cumulus Estate\n* Dindima\n* De Salis\n* Faisan Estate\n* Habitat Vineyard\n* Heifer Station Vineyard\n* Highland Heritage\n* La Colline\n* Matison Estate\n{{col-break}}\n* Mayfield Vineyard\n* Montoro Wines\n* Moody's\n* Nashdale Lane\n* Orange Mountain Wines\n* Patina\n* Philip Shaw\n* Printhie\n* Ross Hill\n{{col-break}}\n* Rowlee Wines\n* Rikard Wines\n* Sassy Wines\n* Slow Wine Co.\n* Strawhouse Wines\n* Stockman's Ridge\n* Swinging Bridge\n* Turner's Vineyard\n* Word of Mouth Wines\n{{col-end}}\nWineries that use Orange region grapes in their wines include [[Brokenwood Wines]] (Hunter Valley based), Logan (Mudgee), Tamburlaine (Hunter Valley), Gartelmann (Hunter Valley), Windowrie (Central Ranges), Eloquesta Wines (Mudgee) and [[David Lowe (winemaker)|Lowe]] Wines (Mudgee).

Currently Suma Park Dam and Spring Creek Reservoir are used for domestic water consumption. Two other dams, [[Lake Canobolas]] and Gosling Creek Reservoir, were previously used for domestic water consumption; however, they are now used for recreational purposes. The city is currently on Level 5 water restrictions.  Orange City Council is undertaking a number of strategies to supplement its supply, including stormwater harvesting.\n\nThe first batch of harvested stormwater was released into Suma Park Dam on 21 April 2009. The harvested stormwater was tested by Analytical Laboratory Services, an independent laboratory based in Sydney. ALS tested for 90 potential pollutants. The tests revealed that the water quality met all targets. The first batch contained 14 megalitres. It is believed to be an Australian first for harvesting stormwater for potable use. The hardware is in place, operating rules have been developed and environmental factors and impacts on downstream users have been considered. A three-month trial will ensure all these elements are working together to ensure high water quality and environmental standards are met. There are several phases involved in the commissioning period. The hardware, which includes three separate pumping stations, creek flow monitoring points and advanced electronics including fibre optic cables, will undergo further operating tests. The other elements of the scheme include a weir on Blackmans Swamp Creek, which creates a 3 megalitre pool and the site for the first pump station, a 200 megalitre dam and two 17 megalitre batching ponds. The pumps on the creek transfer stormwater to the 200 megalitre dam at a rate of up to 450 litres per second and are designed to rapidly extract peak storm flows from the creek. The operating rules require that a base flow immediately downstream in the creek must be maintained. The creek flow monitoring points ensure these standards are met. The monitoring station also measures when harvesting can commence. The trigger is flows passing the monitor in Blackmans Swamp Creek exceeding 1000 litres per second.\n\nThe local mine, Cadia-Ridgeway Mine, uses the city's treated effluent to supplement its water supply.\n\nOrange is currently planning to implement a pipeline from the Macquarie river to boost the town water supply. This is hotly debated, and researchers believe that it will endanger threatened wetland areas.<ref>Cubby, Ben, Pipeline plan puts protected wetlands in peril, say researchers [http://www.smh.com.au/environment/pipeline-plan-puts-protected-wetlands-in-peril-say-researchers-20130728-2qsnw.html]</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Roads===\nOrange is situated on the [[Mitchell Highway]], linking the city to [[Molong]], [[Wellington, New South Wales|Wellington]], [[Dubbo]] and [[Bourke, New South Wales|Bourke]] to the north west, and to [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] to the east and from there to Sydney via the Great Western Highway ({{convert|260|km|mi|-1|disp=or|abbr=on}}).

According to Father Juan Paguere, it was just a wide and long stretch of virgin land located at the southern most end of the province of Cagayan. In 1718, the Govierno Superior ordered the place to become one of the barrios of Tuguegarao. It was named \u201cCabugag\u201d or in short Cabug, the dialect term for hunchback for the first settler was a man with this deformity. So the place was named after him. The name \u201cCabug\u201d is engraved on the town\u2019s first church bell which is still found in the steeple.\n\nIn 1724, The Dominican Friars have thought of giving the barrios their Patron Saint. Cabug was given \u201cNuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Caldas\u201d. The old prominent residents of the barrio had chosen the sixth day of August as her feast day. As year went by, the land area and population of the barrio increased with surprising rapidly. The Cagayan River which flowed close to the barrio site gradually changed its course and moved further towards Cataggaman as flood plains were formed. The non Christian inhabitants called Kalingas gradually deserted the barrio and moved westward to the Mountain Province. As a result, more agricultural lands were cleared and cultivated. Tobacco and corn are the chief crops of the people.\n\nIn September 1849, the Govierno Superior ordered the separation of Cabug from the municipality of Tuguegarao to become a town by itself. The new town was named Enrile in honor of Governor Pascual Enrile who was responsible for building roads in the northern part of Luzon during those days. The separation of Enrile from Tuguegarao led to a change of its patron saint. The population unanimously adopted \u201cNuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Nieves\u201d as its patron Saint. The fifth day of August was selected as her feast day. Since then the feast day had always been celebrated pompously.\n\nAccording to Father Julian Malumbres in his Historia de Cagayan, the name \u201cCabug\u201d was first recorded in the official documents of the Dominican Fathers on January 20, 1849. However the town was known as \u201cCabug\u201d even up 1863 when the name Enrile was officially written and road in the official documents of the Dominican Fathers. Cabug was the original name of Enrile when it was a barrio of Tuguegarao. It was established as a separate town in September 1849 and named in honor of the Spanish Governor General Pascual Enrile during the Spanish regime.\n\nEnrile lies on the southernmost part of Cagayan, bounded by Sta. Maria, Isabela to the south, by the mighty Cagayan River\u00a0 to the east, by Solana and Tuguegarao to the north, Kalinga to the west.\n\nEnrile is predominantly an agricultural town where the majority of its population derive their income from farming. It has a land area of 18,450 hectares unevenly distributed to the 22-barangays of the municipality.

While Enrile has limited natural resources, it takes pride in its human resources. Almost every family in the community has a member that is of the professional class. Enrile is best known as community of intellectuals having the highest literacy rate among all municipalities in the province.\n\nIn 1690, the town of Enrile was a virgin forest on the southernmost portion of the province of Cagayan.\n\nIn 1724 or thereabouts, it was named Cabug, a barrio of Tuguegarao City and it now celebrates its feast day on August 6, later changed to August 5, in honor of its Patron Saint Nuestra Seno\u0155a de las Caldas.\n\nIn the chronicle of Fray Julian Manumbres, Cabug as a geographical unit was officially recorded on January 20, 1849. And although the name Enrile was officially written and read in the records of the Dominicans up to 1863, the town of Enrile was still known as \u201cCabug\u201d.\n\nKalingas, the early settlers, were later joined by neighbor inhabitants in the cleaning and cultivating its rich soil. They plowed and planted the fields with staple products and tobacco.\n\nWith the increasing production and number of educated elders, the Gobierno Superior proclaimed \u201cCabug\u201d separated from Tuguegarao City in 1849, with a new patroness named Nuestra Seno\u0155a de las Nieves.\n\nThis proclamed \u201cCabug\u201d as \u201cEnrile\u201d in honor of Gobernardo General Pascual Enrile, who was responsible for the construction of Luzon\u2019s highways.\n\nSinupac, a hinterland of Enrile, was the hiding place of Emilio Aguinaldo and his revolutionary forces when they retreated from pursuing American forces.\n\nToday the town of Enrile not only boasts of its peaceful,orderly conditions and its competent professionals, but also of its rapidly growing hog and poultry industry.\n\n== Head of Government ==\n=== Gobernadorcillos ===\nA.

DA Assistant Secretary for Agribusiness Leandro Gazmin, who went to Enrile to represent Alcala during the peanut harvest ceremony, said the soil suitability of the town \u2013 sandy to sandy-loam \u2013 and its unique ability to produce peanut year-round are the \u201cprimary reasons why it will be known as an important source of peanut henceforth.\u201d\n\nGazmin said the Secretary lauds them for their collective effort but that the DA chief requests that they \u201ccommit themselves to improve and develop even further not just the peanut industry but the entire agricultural sector as well.\u201d\n\nHe said the Secretary is also happy to know that farmers have been receptive to new technologies hence, they are able to increase productivity from 1.5 to 1.8 tons per hectare.\n\nDuring the peanut harvest, the DA regional office turned over to the local government of Enrile over P4-million worth of farm machineries and equipment, including one unit four-wheel drive tractor, four units of mill for corngrits, 10 heads of carabao, 2,500 kilos of peanut seeds for planting and 300 bags of open-pollinated corn variety.\n\nThough peanut is considered a high value crop by DA, not just in Enrile but in neighboring towns of Pe\u00f1ablanca and Tuguegarao (Cagayan) and Sta. Maria and Cabagan in Isabela, the former was chosen as \u201cnumber one\u201d for having the \u201chighest production share of 1,800 metric tons per year or 8 to10 percent of the national supply.\u201d\n\nAlso, Enrile is the only municipality that can cultivate peanuts during the dry and wet season cropping, the DA said.\n\nDA Region II Executive Director Lucrecio Alviar said that per cropping, the town of Enrile is able to produce a big chunk of the national production, making it the major source of raw materials for various peanut-based products processed and sold in Metro Manila.\n\nEnrile is home to 800 peanut farmers cultivating 700 hectares of farmlands with a potential expansion area of another 800 hectares. \u201cWith improved production and yield, Enrile may be able to fill up a portion, if not all, of the import requirement for peanut of 15,060 metric tons,\u201d Alviar added.\n\nWith the use of technology from DA and the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) \u2013 particularly the use of improved varieties and fertilizers like Boron and Gypsum \u2013 the DA is optimistic that \u201cpeanut production could reach an all-time high of 3.25 tons per hectare,\u201d or an increase of 200 percent over its current average. The DA said it hopes the farmers can sustain their productivity.\n\nGazmin also encouraged peanut farmers to bring their harvest to the Isabela Agri-Pinoy Trading Center, where they can directly sell their produce. The Isabela APTC is part of the government\u2019s effort to empower farmers to become traders to enhance their incomes, stabilize food prices and encourage them to produce more. \u201cLet us utilize the center as a venue for cooperativism\u201d and enabling each other to produce and earn more, he said.\n\n== Transportation ==\n[[File:1Enrile.jpg|alt=|thumb|1 Enrile.

According to Father Juan Paguere, it was just a wide and long stretch of virgin land located at the southern most end of the province of Cagayan. In 1718, the Govierno Superior ordered the place to become one of the barrios of Tuguegarao. It was named \u201cCabugag\u201d or in short Cabug, the dialect term for hunchback for the first settler was a man with this deformity. So the place was named after him. The name \u201cCabug\u201d is engraved on the town\u2019s first church bell which is still found in the steeple.\n\nIn 1724, The Dominican Friars have thought of giving the barrios their Patron Saint. Cabug was given \u201cNuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Caldas\u201d. The old prominent residents of the barrio had chosen the sixth day of August as her feast day. As year went by, the land area and population of the barrio increased with surprising rapidly. The Cagayan River which flowed close to the barrio site gradually changed its course and moved further towards Cataggaman as flood plains were formed. The non Christian inhabitants called Kalingas gradually deserted the barrio and moved westward to the Mountain Province. As a result, more agricultural lands were cleared and cultivated. Tobacco and corn are the chief crops of the people.\n\nIn September 1849, the Govierno Superior ordered the separation of Cabug from the municipality of Tuguegarao to become a town by itself. The new town was named Enrile in honor of Governor Pascual Enrile who was responsible for building roads in the northern part of Luzon during those days. The separation of Enrile from Tuguegarao led to a change of its patron saint. The population unanimously adopted \u201cNuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Nieves\u201d as its patron Saint. The fifth day of August was selected as her feast day. Since then the feast day had always been celebrated pompously.\n\nAccording to Father Julian Malumbres in his Historia de Cagayan, the name \u201cCabug\u201d was first recorded in the official documents of the Dominican Fathers on January 20, 1849. However the town was known as \u201cCabug\u201d even up 1863 when the name Enrile was officially written and road in the official documents of the Dominican Fathers. Cabug was the original name of Enrile when it was a barrio of Tuguegarao. It was established as a separate town in September 1849 and named in honor of the Spanish Governor General Pascual Enrile during the Spanish regime.\n\nEnrile lies on the southernmost part of Cagayan, bounded by Sta.

Enrile is best known as community of intellectuals having the highest literacy rate among all municipalities in the province.\n\nIn 1690, the town of Enrile was a virgin forest on the southernmost portion of the province of Cagayan.\n\nIn 1724 or thereabouts, it was named Cabug, a barrio of Tuguegarao City and it now celebrates its feast day on August 6, later changed to August 5, in honor of its Patron Saint Nuestra Seno\u0155a de las Caldas.\n\nIn the chronicle of Fray Julian Manumbres, Cabug as a geographical unit was officially recorded on January 20, 1849. And although the name Enrile was officially written and read in the records of the Dominicans up to 1863, the town of Enrile was still known as \u201cCabug\u201d.\n\nKalingas, the early settlers, were later joined by neighbor inhabitants in the cleaning and cultivating its rich soil. They plowed and planted the fields with staple products and tobacco.\n\nWith the increasing production and number of educated elders, the Gobierno Superior proclaimed \u201cCabug\u201d separated from Tuguegarao City in 1849, with a new patroness named Nuestra Seno\u0155a de las Nieves.\n\nThis proclamed \u201cCabug\u201d as \u201cEnrile\u201d in honor of Gobernardo General Pascual Enrile, who was responsible for the construction of Luzon\u2019s highways.\n\nSinupac, a hinterland of Enrile, was the hiding place of Emilio Aguinaldo and his revolutionary forces when they retreated from pursuing American forces.\n\nToday the town of Enrile not only boasts of its peaceful,orderly conditions and its competent professionals, but also of its rapidly growing hog and poultry industry.\n\n== Head of Government ==\n=== Gobernadorcillos ===\nA.

DA Assistant Secretary for Agribusiness Leandro Gazmin, who went to Enrile to represent Alcala during the peanut harvest ceremony, said the soil suitability of the town \u2013 sandy to sandy-loam \u2013 and its unique ability to produce peanut year-round are the \u201cprimary reasons why it will be known as an important source of peanut henceforth.\u201d\n\nGazmin said the Secretary lauds them for their collective effort but that the DA chief requests that they \u201ccommit themselves to improve and develop even further not just the peanut industry but the entire agricultural sector as well.\u201d\n\nHe said the Secretary is also happy to know that farmers have been receptive to new technologies hence, they are able to increase productivity from 1.5 to 1.8 tons per hectare.\n\nDuring the peanut harvest, the DA regional office turned over to the local government of Enrile over P4-million worth of farm machineries and equipment, including one unit four-wheel drive tractor, four units of mill for corngrits, 10 heads of carabao, 2,500 kilos of peanut seeds for planting and 300 bags of open-pollinated corn variety.\n\nThough peanut is considered a high value crop by DA, not just in Enrile but in neighboring towns of Pe\u00f1ablanca and Tuguegarao (Cagayan) and Sta. Maria and Cabagan in Isabela, the former was chosen as \u201cnumber one\u201d for having the \u201chighest production share of 1,800 metric tons per year or 8 to10 percent of the national supply.\u201d\n\nAlso, Enrile is the only municipality that can cultivate peanuts during the dry and wet season cropping, the DA said.\n\nDA Region II Executive Director Lucrecio Alviar said that per cropping, the town of Enrile is able to produce a big chunk of the national production, making it the major source of raw materials for various peanut-based products processed and sold in Metro Manila.\n\nEnrile is home to 800 peanut farmers cultivating 700 hectares of farmlands with a potential expansion area of another 800 hectares. \u201cWith improved production and yield, Enrile may be able to fill up a portion, if not all, of the import requirement for peanut of 15,060 metric tons,\u201d Alviar added.\n\nWith the use of technology from DA and the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) \u2013 particularly the use of improved varieties and fertilizers like Boron and Gypsum \u2013 the DA is optimistic that \u201cpeanut production could reach an all-time high of 3.25 tons per hectare,\u201d or an increase of 200 percent over its current average. The DA said it hopes the farmers can sustain their productivity.\n\nGazmin also encouraged peanut farmers to bring their harvest to the Isabela Agri-Pinoy Trading Center, where they can directly sell their produce. The Isabela APTC is part of the government\u2019s effort to empower farmers to become traders to enhance their incomes, stabilize food prices and encourage them to produce more. \u201cLet us utilize the center as a venue for cooperativism\u201d and enabling each other to produce and earn more, he said.\n\n== Transportation ==\n[[File:1Enrile.jpg|alt=|thumb|1 Enrile. Christmas at Enrile, Cagayan]]\nPassenger jeepneys, tricycles and other private transportation vehicles service all routes within and outside Enrile. Kalesa is also driven within the Poblacion and barangays only.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120413163013/http://nap.psa.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/default.asp Philippine Standard Geographic Code]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081120024509/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/census2007/index.html Philippine Census Information]\n\n{{Geographic location\n|Centre    = Enrile\n|North     = [[Solana, Cagayan|Solana]] / [[Tuguegarao]]<br>''[[Cagayan River]]''\n|East      = ''[[Cagayan River]]'' / [[Tuguegarao]]\n|South     = [[Santa Maria, Isabela]]\n|Southwest = [[Rizal, Kalinga]]\n|West      = [[Solana, Cagayan|Solana]]\n}}\n{{Cagayan}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities of Cagayan]]\n[[Category:Populated places on the Rio Grande de Cagayan]]\n\n\n{{CagayanValley-geo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Sangguniang Bayan ng Enrile", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrile,_Cagayan"}
