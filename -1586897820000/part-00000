After two years at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, he entered the [[Society of Jesus]] (the Jesuits) at the age of nineteen and began his path to ordination as a priest in 1956. During these years, he published several books of poetry and a journal, ''Picnic in Babylon: A Jesuit Priest's Journal,'' 1963- 1967 (1967), which chronicled his final years of seminary study. The latter part of L'Heureux's life as a Jesuit coincided with the upheaval the Roman Catholic Church experienced in the wake of the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965), which was convened to \"open the church's windows\" more widely to the complicated aspirations of the modern world. The turbulence that accompanied engagement with the world proved to be both exhilarating and disruptive for an entire generation of priests and nuns.

His poem \"from St. Ignatius Loyola, Founder of the Jesuits: His Autobiography [with directions for reading]\" (in ''[[No Place for Hiding]]'', 1971)  bridged verse and narrative prose. L'Heureux said later in an unpublished interview that he \"never looked back. It became more satisfying to explore consciousnesses different from one's own.\" His short fiction began appearing in ''The New Yorker'', ''The Atlantic Monthly'', ''Harper's'', ''Esquire'', and several literary journals, and has been included in Prize Stories: [[O.

In the first part the author teaches a good religious divers means and practices which he should observe in order to remain a faithful child of the Church, to acquire, on earth, the grace of perfection and, in heaven, ever-lasting happiness. In the second part, by a quaint allegory, he puts the religious on his guard against the faults of monastic life which are represented by twenty birds of prey, the eagle, the vulture, the hawk, the owl, etc., whose characteristics and manners he describes. Though written in an uncultured style, the book was much read in the monasteries of the Middle Ages.\n\nThe subject of Kr\u00e4mer's second book is against [[anger]], as indicated by its title, \"Tractatus exhortativus ad evitandam malam iram\".\n\nAn unpublished treatise, \"De Objectionibus bibliae\", has also been sometimes attributed to Kr\u00e4mer, but without sufficient warrant.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n;Attribution\n*{{Catholic|wstitle=John Kr\u00e4mer}} The entry cites:\n**[[Bernard Pez]], ''Bibliotheca ascetica, antiquo-nova'' VII (Ratisbon, 1723-), 119-388; \n**PETREIUS, Bibliotheca Carthusiana (Cologne, 1609);\n**FABRICIUS, Bibliotheca Latina mediae aetatis (Florence, 1898 -) III; \n**PUYOL, L'Auteur du livre de imitatione Christi (Paris, 1899).\n\n<!-- Navboxes go here -->\n{{Subject bar |portal1= Biography |portal2= Catholicism |portal3= Germany}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kramer,  John}}\n[[Category:15th-century German people]]\n[[Category:Carthusians]]\n[[Category:German Christian monks]]\n[[Category:15th-century German writers]]\n[[Category:15th-century Roman Catholics]]\n[[Category:German male writers]]\n", "text_old": "{{no footnotes|date=November 2019}}\n'''John Kr\u00e4mer''' (known also as Institor, a Latin form of his surname) was a German [[Carthusian]] writer.

In the first part the author teaches a good religious divers means and practices which he should observe in order to remain a faithful child of the Church, to acquire, on earth, the grace of perfection and, in heaven, ever-lasting happiness. In the second part, by a quaint allegory, he puts the religious on his guard against the faults of monastic life which are represented by twenty birds of prey, the eagle, the vulture, the hawk, the owl, etc., whose characteristics and manners he describes. Though written in an uncultured style, the book was much read in the monasteries of the Middle Ages.\n\nThe subject of Kr\u00e4mer's second book is against [[anger]], as indicated by its title, \"Tractatus exhortativus ad evitandam malam iram\".\n\nAn unpublished treatise, \"De Objectionibus bibliae\", has also been sometimes attributed to Kr\u00e4mer, but without sufficient warrant.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n;Attribution\n*{{Catholic|wstitle=John Kr\u00e4mer}} The entry cites:\n**[[Bernard Pez]], ''Bibliotheca ascetica, antiquo-nova'' VII (Ratisbon, 1723-), 119-388; \n**PETREIUS, Bibliotheca Carthusiana (Cologne, 1609);\n**FABRICIUS, Bibliotheca Latina mediae aetatis (Florence, 1898 -) III; \n**PUYOL, L'Auteur du livre de imitatione Christi (Paris, 1899).\n\n<!-- Navboxes go here -->\n{{Subject bar |portal1= Biography |portal2= Catholicism |portal3= Germany}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kramer,  John}}\n[[Category:15th-century German people]]\n[[Category:Carthusians]]\n[[Category:German Christian monks]]\n[[Category:15th-century German writers]]\n[[Category:15th-century Roman Catholics]]\n[[Category:German male writers]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kr%C3%A4mer"}
