Artistic representations of the ''auto-da-f\u00e9'' usually depict physical punishment such as [[flagellation|whipping]], torture, and [[execution by burning|burning at the stake]].\n\nThe ''auto-da-f\u00e9'' was also a form of penitence for the public viewers, because they too were engaging in a process of reconciliation and by being involved were given the chance to confront their sins and be forgiven by the Church.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[File:Goya9.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Condemned by the Inquisition wearing a sambenito carrying the cross of St. Andrew  ([[Francisco de Goya]]).]]\n\nThe ''auto-da-f\u00e9'', usually represented as a heretic being burned at the stake, is a symbol used widely in the arts, especially in Europe.\n\n*[[Voltaire]] featured an ''auto-da-f\u00e9'' held by the people of Lisbon after the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]] in chapter six of his anti-religious satire ''[[Candide]]'' (1759). The university of Coimbra decides that this \"great ceremony was an infallible means of preventing the earth from quaking.\"\n*[[Edgar Allan Poe]] \u2013 In \"[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]\", Poe uses the ''auto-da-f\u00e9'' as a reference point for the narrator as he tries to determine what is happening to him.\n*[[Giuseppe Verdi]] \u2013 In his 1866 opera ''[[Don Carlos]]'', Verdi includes a pivotal scene in the third act that depicts the beginning of an ''auto-da-f\u00e9'' in front of the Cathedral of Valladolid in Spain where heretics are about to be burned at the stake.\n*[[Herman Melville]] \u2013 In ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', near the end of Chapter 54, mentions ''auto-da-f\u00e9'' in passing: {{\"'}}Though there are no Auto-da-Fe's in Lima now,' said one of the company to another; 'I fear our sailor friend runs the risk of the [[archiepiscopacy]].  Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight.  I see no need of this.{{'\"}} In \"The Confidence-Man: His Masquerade\" (1857), set on a Mississippi steamboat filled with colorful characters and the Devil himself as the con-man, Melville weaves an allegory on how easily one may win over a person's, or for that matter,  an entire people's confidence. The story begins and ends with the appearance of mysterious young men, the latter of whom is described as wearing tattered red and yellow clothes reminiscent of \u201ca victim in <i>auto-da-fe</i>.\u201d The book opens with the words \"Dedicated to victims of Auto da Fe.\"\n*[[Leonard Bernstein]] composed and produced a [[Candide (musical)|musical adaptation of Voltaire's ''Candide'']] in 1956, featuring a song called ''Auto-da-F\u00e9'' that includes the chorus, \"It's a lovely day for drinking and for watching people fry,\" referring to the spectacle of public executions.\n*[[Elias Canetti]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1981 for his work, especially his novel ''Die Blendung'' (1935), literally \"The Blinding,\" translated into English as ''[[Auto-da-F\u00e9 (novel)|Auto-da-F\u00e9]]'' (1946).\n*[[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] begins a chapter of ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' with a \"splendid Auto-da-F\u00e9\". The chapter is famously called \"[[The Grand Inquisitor]]\".\n*In [[Thornton Wilder]]'s 1927 novel [[The Bridge of San Luis Rey]], a central character, the friar Brother Juniper, is burned for heresy in an auto-da-f\u00e9 in early 18th-century [[Peru]].  Although the novel is fictional, autos-de-f\u00e9 did occur in [[Lima, Peru]] at least as late as 1733.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historiayverdad.org/Inquisicion/Auto-de-fe-Lima-Peru-1733.pdf|title=Relacion del auto de fe}}</ref> \n*[[Tennessee Williams]] wrote a one-act play entitled ''Auto-da-F\u00e9'' (1938).\n*[[Roger Zelazny]] wrote a short story, ''[[Auto-da-F\u00e9 (short story)|Auto-da-F\u00e9]]'', which appeared in ''[[Dangerous Visions]]'', 1967.\n*In [[Dai Sijie]]'s ''[[Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress]]'', the final climactic book burning is repeatedly referred to as ''auto-da-f\u00e9''.\n*[[Man of La Mancha]], 1965 [[Musical theatre|musical]] with a book by [[Dale Wasserman]].  It tells the story of the \"mad\" knight Don Quixote as a play within a play, performed by Cervantes and his fellow prisoners as he awaits a hearing with the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. \n*[[Richard Zimler]] describes the humiliation and torments of his narrator and an imprisoned [[Jain]] in an auto-da-f\u00e9 in his novel ''Guardian of the Dawn'', which is set in the Portuguese colony of [[Goa]] at the beginning of the 17th century.\n*[[Jos\u00e9 Saramago]] goes into detail about an Auto-da-f\u00e9 in ''[[Baltasar and Blimunda]]'' (1982).\n*[[Mel Brooks]]'s cult comedy ''[[History of the World, Part I]]'' (1981) makes reference to the auto-da-f\u00e9 in its segment about the [[Spanish Inquisition]].\n*''[[The West Wing]]'' episode \"7A Wf 83429\", the first episode of the fifth season, when referring to a meeting where the Democratic leaders are going to punish them for invoking the 25th, Josh says \"Anyone else coming to the auto da fe?\"\n*[[SPK (band)|SPK]] titled their 1983 compilation album ''Auto Da Fe''.\n*In [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|Matthew Lewis]]'s Gothic novel ''[[The Monk]]'' (1796), [[madrile\u00f1o]] monk Ambrosio barely escapes burning in an auto-da-f\u00e9. Convicted of rape and murder (which also turns out to be incest and matricide) he is sentenced to death by burning at the stake. He is rescued last-minute by the intervention of Lucifer only to be left on a precipice in the [[Sierra Morena]] mountains. After falling down, insects drink his blood and mountain eagles \"tore his flesh piecemeal, and dug out his eye-balls with their crooked beaks\" before he perishes.\n*The 2016 film [[Assassin's Creed (film)|''Assassin's Creed'']] depicts an auto-da-f\u00e9 in 1492 Spain.  The sequence involves a parading of the accused and the outcomes of the sentencing.\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n;Bibliography\n* Arouet, Francois-Marie (Voltaire) (1758).

On leaving secondary school he was conscripted as a [[Flakhelfer]] before, in April 1944, he joined the [[Nazi Party]] and served in the [[Wehrmacht]]. He became a [[POW]] and was released by the Americans in 1946. From 1947 until 1949 he was a chemists' apprentice, working in that profession until 1950. From 1950 to 1952 he was the manager of a pharmaceutical company in the [[German Democratic Republic]].\n\nSince the publication of his first crime novel, \"Gro\u00dfgarage S\u00fcdwest\" he worked as a freelance author. He travelled several times to the [[Caribbean]] and to the United States. Since 1958, the GDR's [[Ministerium f\u00fcr Staatssicherheit|Staatssicherheitsdienst (Stasi)]] kept him under special surveillance. Until 1972 Schreyer lived in [[Magdeburg]]; since then he lived in [[Ahrenshoop]] on the coast of the Baltic Sea.\n\nSchreyer was the author of numerous novels, which are mainly considered entertainment, containing some criticism of society. Most successful were the stories set in Central America and the Caribbean, in which he skillfully mixed fiction and documentary. Other works are crime stories, a science-fiction story, film scripts, TV and radio drama. Having sold more than five million copies, Schreyer is considered one of the most successful East German authors.\n\nIn 1956 Schreyer was awarded the [[Heinrich-Mann-Preis]]. Since 1952 he was a member of the East German authors guild, since 1974 a member of [[P.E.N.]]; and since [[German reunification]] in 1990 he was a member of the German authors guild.\n\nSchreyer died on 14 November 2017 at the age of 89.<ref>[http://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/mecklenburg-vorpommern/DDR-Autor-Wolfgang-Schreyer-gestorben,schreyer104.html DDR-Autor Wolfgang Schreyer gestorben] {{in lang|de}}</ref>\n\n==Work==\n* ''Gro\u00dfgarage S\u00fcdwest'', Berlin 1952\n* ''Mit Kr\u00e4uterschnaps und Gottvertrauen'', Berlin 1953\n* ''Unternehmen \"Thunderstorm\"'', Berlin 1954\n* ''Die Banknote'', Berlin 1955\n* ''Sch\u00fcsse \u00fcber der Ostsee'', Berlin 1956\n* ''Der Traum des Hauptmann Loy'', Berlin 1956\n* ''Das Attentat'', Berlin 1957\n* ''Der Spion von Akrotiri'', Berlin 1957\n* ''Alaskaf\u00fcchse'', Berlin 1959\n* ''Das gr\u00fcne Ungeheuer'', Berlin 1959\n* ''Entscheidung an der Weichsel'', Berlin 1960\n* ''Tempel des Satans'', Berlin 1960\n* ''Die Piratenchronik'', Berlin 1961 (republished in 1967 as ''Augen am Himmel: Eine Piratenchronik'' (Eyes in the sky))\n* ''Vampire, Tyrannen, Rebellen'', Berlin 1963 (together with G\u00fcnter Schumacher)\n* ''Preludio 11'', Berlin 1964\n* ''Fremder im Paradies'', Halle (Saale) 1966 (republished 1971 within ''Welt der Abenteuer'')\n* ''Aufstand des Sisyphos'', Berlin 1969 (together with J\u00fcrgen Hell)\n* ''Der gelbe Hai'', Berlin 1969\n* ''Bananengangster'', Berlin 1970\n* ''Der Adjutant'', Halle (S.) 1971\n* ''Der Resident'', Halle (Saale) 1973\n* ''Tod des Chefs oder Die Liebe zur Opposition'', Berlin 1975\n* ''Schwarzer Dezember'', Halle (Saale) 1977\n* ''Die Entf\u00fchrung'', Halle [u.a.] 1979\n* ''Der Reporter'', Halle [u.a.] 1980\n* ''Die Suche oder Die Abenteuer des Uwe Reuss'', Berlin 1981\n* ''Eiskalt im Paradies'', Halle [u.a.] 1982\n* ''Die f\u00fcnf Leben des Dr. Gundlach'', Berlin 1982\n* ''Der Fund oder Die Abenteuer des Uwe Reuss'', Berlin 1987\n* ''Der Mann auf den Klippen'', Berlin 1987\n* ''Der sechste Sinn'', Halle [u.a.] 1987\n* ''Unabwendbar'', Berlin 1988\n* ''Die Beute'', Rostock 1989\n* ''Endzeit der Sieger'', Halle [u.a.] 1989\n* ''Alptr\u00e4ume'', Oschersleben 1991\n* ''Nebel'', Berlin 1991\n* ''Das Quartett'', Berlin 1994\n* ''Der zweite Mann'', Berlin 2000\n* ''Der Verlust oder Die Abenteuer des Uwe Reuss'', Rostock 2001\n* ''Das Kurhaus'', Rostock 2002\n* ''Die Legende'', Berlin 2006 (together with Paul Schreyer)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{DNB portal|122338820|TYP=}}\n* [http://www.stiftung-aufarbeitung.de/service_wegweiser/personen_detail.php?ID=2184 Profile] at [[Stiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur]]\n* [http://www.mvweb.de/kdb/autoren/schreyer/ Profil at mvweb.de]\n* http://www.dielegende.info/\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20120213134430/http://www.ila-bonn.de/buchbesprechungen/buecher249.htm\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2016}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Schreyer, Wolfgang}}\n[[Category:1927 births]]\n[[Category:2017 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Magdeburg]]\n[[Category:People from the Province of Saxony]]\n[[Category:Nazi Party members]]\n[[Category:East German writers]]\n[[Category:German male novelists]]\n[[Category:Writers from Saxony-Anhalt]]\n[[Category:20th-century German male writers]]\n[[Category:20th-century German novelists]]\n[[Category:21st-century German novelists]]\n[[Category:21st-century German male writers]]\n[[Category:German military personnel of World War II]]\n[[Category:German prisoners of war in World War II held by the United States]]\n[[Category:Heinrich Mann Prize winners]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox person\n| name          = Wolfgang Schreyer\n| birth_name    = \n| image     = Wolfgang Schreyer (2004) by Guenter Prust.jpg\n| caption      = Wolfgang Schreyer (2004)\n| imagesize     = \n| birth_date     = 20 November 1927\n| birth_place    = [[Magdeburg]], [[Province of Saxony]], [[Weimar Republic|Germany]]\n| death_date     = {{death date and age|2017|11|14|1927|11|20|df=y}}\n| death_place    =  [[Ahrenshoop]]\n| occupation    = Writer\n|party         = [[NSDAP]] (1944\u20131945)\n|partner        = \n|children        = \n|parents    = \n|alma_mater =\n| nationality   = Germany\n}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-37039-0004, Verleihung des Heinrich-Mann-Preis an Franz F\u00fchmann.jpg|thumb|Wolfgang Schreyer (left) with [[Franz F\u00fchmann]] and [[Rudolf Fischer (writer)|Rudolf Fischer]].]]\n'''Wolfgang Schreyer''' (20 November 1927 &ndash;

He became a [[POW]] and was released by the Americans in 1946. From 1947 until 1949 he was a chemists' apprentice, working in that profession until 1950. From 1950 to 1952 he was the manager of a pharmaceutical company in the [[German Democratic Republic]].\n\nSince the publication of his first crime novel, \"Gro\u00dfgarage S\u00fcdwest\" he worked as a freelance author. He travelled several times to the [[Caribbean]] and to the United States. Since 1958, the GDR's [[Ministerium f\u00fcr Staatssicherheit|Staatssicherheitsdienst (Stasi)]] kept him under special surveillance. Until 1972 Schreyer lived in [[Magdeburg]]; since then he lived in [[Ahrenshoop]] on the coast of the Baltic Sea.\n\nSchreyer was the author of numerous novels, which are mainly considered entertainment, containing some criticism of society. Most successful were the stories set in Central America and the Caribbean, in which he skillfully mixed fiction and documentary. Other works are crime stories, a science-fiction story, film scripts, TV and radio drama. Having sold more than five million copies, Schreyer is considered one of the most successful East German authors.\n\nIn 1956 Schreyer was awarded the [[Heinrich-Mann-Preis]]. Since 1952 he was a member of the East German authors guild, since 1974 a member of [[P.E.N.]]; and since [[German reunification]] in 1990 he was a member of the German authors guild.\n\nSchreyer died on 14 November 2017 at the age of 89.<ref>[http://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/mecklenburg-vorpommern/DDR-Autor-Wolfgang-Schreyer-gestorben,schreyer104.html DDR-Autor Wolfgang Schreyer gestorben] {{in lang|de}}</ref>\n\n==Work==\n* ''Gro\u00dfgarage S\u00fcdwest'', Berlin 1952\n* ''Mit Kr\u00e4uterschnaps und Gottvertrauen'', Berlin 1953\n* ''Unternehmen \"Thunderstorm\"'', Berlin 1954\n* ''Die Banknote'', Berlin 1955\n* ''Sch\u00fcsse \u00fcber der Ostsee'', Berlin 1956\n* ''Der Traum des Hauptmann Loy'', Berlin 1956\n* ''Das Attentat'', Berlin 1957\n* ''Der Spion von Akrotiri'', Berlin 1957\n* ''Alaskaf\u00fcchse'', Berlin 1959\n* ''Das gr\u00fcne Ungeheuer'', Berlin 1959\n* ''Entscheidung an der Weichsel'', Berlin 1960\n* ''Tempel des Satans'', Berlin 1960\n* ''Die Piratenchronik'', Berlin 1961 (republished in 1967 as ''Augen am Himmel: Eine Piratenchronik'' (Eyes in the sky))\n* ''Vampire, Tyrannen, Rebellen'', Berlin 1963 (together with G\u00fcnter Schumacher)\n* ''Preludio 11'', Berlin 1964\n* ''Fremder im Paradies'', Halle (Saale) 1966 (republished 1971 within ''Welt der Abenteuer'')\n* ''Aufstand des Sisyphos'', Berlin 1969 (together with J\u00fcrgen Hell)\n* ''Der gelbe Hai'', Berlin 1969\n* ''Bananengangster'', Berlin 1970\n* ''Der Adjutant'', Halle (S.) 1971\n* ''Der Resident'', Halle (Saale) 1973\n* ''Tod des Chefs oder Die Liebe zur Opposition'', Berlin 1975\n* ''Schwarzer Dezember'', Halle (Saale) 1977\n* ''Die Entf\u00fchrung'', Halle [u.a.] 1979\n* ''Der Reporter'', Halle [u.a.] 1980\n* ''Die Suche oder Die Abenteuer des Uwe Reuss'', Berlin 1981\n* ''Eiskalt im Paradies'', Halle [u.a.] 1982\n* ''Die f\u00fcnf Leben des Dr. Gundlach'', Berlin 1982\n* ''Der Fund oder Die Abenteuer des Uwe Reuss'', Berlin 1987\n* ''Der Mann auf den Klippen'', Berlin 1987\n* ''Der sechste Sinn'', Halle [u.a.] 1987\n* ''Unabwendbar'', Berlin 1988\n* ''Die Beute'', Rostock 1989\n* ''Endzeit der Sieger'', Halle [u.a.] 1989\n* ''Alptr\u00e4ume'', Oschersleben 1991\n* ''Nebel'', Berlin 1991\n* ''Das Quartett'', Berlin 1994\n* ''Der zweite Mann'', Berlin 2000\n* ''Der Verlust oder Die Abenteuer des Uwe Reuss'', Rostock 2001\n* ''Das Kurhaus'', Rostock 2002\n* ''Die Legende'', Berlin 2006 (together with Paul Schreyer)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{DNB portal|122338820|TYP=}}\n* [http://www.stiftung-aufarbeitung.de/service_wegweiser/personen_detail.php?ID=2184 Profile] at [[Stiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur]]\n* [http://www.mvweb.de/kdb/autoren/schreyer/ Profil at mvweb.de]\n* http://www.dielegende.info/\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20120213134430/http://www.ila-bonn.de/buchbesprechungen/buecher249.htm\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2016}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Schreyer, Wolfgang}}\n[[Category:1927 births]]\n[[Category:2017 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Magdeburg]]\n[[Category:People from the Province of Saxony]]\n[[Category:Nazi Party members]]\n[[Category:East German writers]]\n[[Category:German male novelists]]\n[[Category:Writers from Saxony-Anhalt]]\n[[Category:20th-century German male writers]]\n[[Category:20th-century German novelists]]\n[[Category:21st-century German novelists]]\n[[Category:21st-century male writers]]\n[[Category:German military personnel of World War II]]\n[[Category:German prisoners of war in World War II held by the United States]]\n[[Category:Heinrich Mann Prize winners]]\n", "name_user": "Bearcat", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:recat", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Schreyer"}

His father was employed in the transport and commercial sectors.<ref name=WFlautwww/>    In 1935 his father died as a result of wounds sustained during the [[First World War]], leaving his mother to raise the children under conditions of financial hardship.  She succeeded in distancing them from Nazi indoctrination.   As a school boy, between 1936 and 1944, Wieland rejected the Nazi system and pressures to take part in government sponsored uniformed organisations.

He was also conscripted into the local branch of the newly launched [[Volkssturm|German Home Guard (''\"Volksturm\"'')]], and it was as a member of the Home Guard that he experienced the [[Bombing of Dresden|English and American air attacks that destroyed the central districts of city]] one day after his fifteenth birthday, on the night of 13 February 1945.<ref name=WFlautDLR/>   In the chaos following the attacks he was able to escape from the Home Guard, remaining in his home district till war ended, formally on 8 May 1945, after which Dresden and the surrounding region of central Germany were [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|administered]] as the [[Soviet occupation]].   Technical draftsmanship was officially designated as women's work, and Wieland was required to undertake hands-on work (''\"als Rohrleger\"'') in industrial engineering.<ref name=BreifwechsellautPL/>\n\nOn 17 September 1946 he found himself taken in by the police and handed over to the [[NKVD]] after a neighbour denounced him on grounds of suspected possession of weapons.<ref name=BreifwechsellautPL/>    The background to the affair was an attempt to make the F\u00f6rster family exchange their home for rented accommodation, after the German police had blocked an attempt by the Communist authorities to make them pay rent for living in their own home.<ref name=\"Mlekusch2012\"/>   Wieland was initially sentenced to ten years of forced labour in [[Siberia]], but after three months of nightly interrogation, a Soviet military tribunal reduced the term to 7\u00bd years.   On 28 December 1946 he was interned at [[NKVD special camps in Germany 1945\u201349|NKVD \"Special Camp\" IV]], a concentration camp which the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|authorities]] had constructed  next to [[:de:Justizvollzugsanstalt Bautzen|the jail]] at [[Bautzen]].   As the camp commanders set about sorting out the prisoners fit for work to be transported to Siberia, a Soviet military doctor determined that Wieland F\u00f6rster was unfit for work.   He was therefore left behind in [[NKVD special camps in Germany 1945\u201349|NKVD \"Special Camp\" IV]].<ref name=\"Mlekusch2012\"/>   In the aftermath of war the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|authorities]] refused to discuss or even to acknowledge the continuing existence of concentration camps in the [[Soviet occupation zone|Soviet part]] of occupied Germany, but their all too physical presence never became increasingly hard to dispute.   By 1950 F\u00f6rster was in poor general health dangerously ill with [[Tuberculosis]] and on 21 January 1950, following a threatened investigation by the [[International Red Cross]], he was the beneficiary of a \"backdoor\" release, emerging from the camp without identity papers and without any formal pardon or other explanation.   Official acknowledgment that he had been a victim of Stalinist persecution followed in 1991.<ref name=\"Mlekusch2012\"/>\n\n=== Further study and training===\nDespite having emerged from after nearly four years interned in [[NKVD special camps in Germany 1945\u201349|NKVD \"Special Camp\" IV]], in 1950 F\u00f6rster was still aged only 20.<ref name=\"Mlekusch2012\"/>   The previous year, in October 1949, the [[Soviet occupation zone]] had been relaunched as the Soviet sponsored [[German Democratic Republic|German Democratic Republic (East Germany)]].   It was in this new kind of [[one-party state|one-]][[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|party]] [[National Front (East Germany)|dictatorship]],  with its principal [[Constitution of East Germany|political]] and economic structures modelled on those of the [[Soviet Union]] itself, that F\u00f6rster built his life and career over the next four decades.   He abandoned his ambition to become a technical draftsman, but nevertheless returned to work with the Dresden municipal waterworks, employed in the planning department till 1953.<ref name=WFlautGH>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-himmel.de/en/Kuenstler/Wieland-Foerster/Vita_2_2.html|title=Wieland F\u00f6rster|publisher=Galerie Himmel, Dresden|accessdate=3 March 2017}}</ref>   During these years he was using his spare time to try out various artistic forms of expression, such as writing, music, theatre and advertising, along with the more visual arts.   In the Autumn/Fall of 1952 he took part in a public \"drawing event\" at the [[Dresden Academy of Fine Arts]] where the teachers encouraged him to enroll as a student.<ref name=\"Mlekusch2012\"/>\n\nHe applied to his employers to back his application to sponsor his application to study at [[Dresden Academy of Fine Arts|the academy]], but was turned down for reasons that involved the risk of \"Verb\u00fcrgerlichung\" (''loosely: \"bourgeoisization\"'').   He therefore made the application anyway, on his own responsibility, and was accepted.   He was a student at the [[Dresden Academy of Fine Arts]] between 1953 and 1958.<ref name=WFlautwww/>   He began his study of sculpting in 1953, taught by [[Walter Arnold (sculptor)|Walter Arnold]] and Arnold's assistant [[Gerd Jaeger]] .   Another of his teachers was [[Hans Steger (sculptor)|Hans Steger]].   The focus of the training at Dresden was on [[:de:Neoklassizismus (Bildende Kunst)|neoclassical form]], backed up by compulsory courses in drawing, on use of plaster casts and on nature.   The study of anatomy and history of art were also included and required.<ref name=\"Mlekusch2012\"/>\n\nBy his second year F\u00f6rster was already establishing contacts with representatives of the officially forbidden \"classical modern\" art movement.   By this time the [[Iron curtain|division]] [[Allied-occupied Germany|of Germany]] agreed between the [[Allies of World War II|Americans and the Soviets]] at [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]] at the beginning of 1945 had crystallised into  a permanent frontier, but the [[Inner German border|border]] between the two Germanies was still relatively porous, especially between [[West Berlin]] and the surrounding territories governed as [[East Germany]], and F\u00f6rster took the opportunity to visit [[Bernhard Heiliger]] in [[West Berlin|the west]].   [[Walter Arnold (sculptor)|Walter Arnold]], himself a consummate hands-on craftsman, helped a few of his students, whom he regarded as politically reliable, to deepen their understanding on the essential elements in figurative sculpture, by gaining experience with the works of the westerners [[Hermann Haller (sculptor)|Hermann Haller]] and [[Charles Despiau]].<ref name=\"Mlekusch2012\"/>   In his third year, required to produce a \"portrait from a 'photo\", F\u00f6rster chose as his subject [[Bertolt Brecht]], a long-standing icon of the German intellectual left but nevertheless at this stage ostracised by [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|the authorities]].   In order to accomplish his course objective he was permitted, a few weeks before [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht's]] death in 1956, to attend a rehearsal of [[Life of Galileo]], being staged by the [[Berliner Ensemble|Berliner Ensemble (theatre company)]].<ref name=WFlautZZ>{{cite web|url=http://www.zeitzeugen-tv.com/dossier/movie/4220/wieland-foerster-ein-stiller-rebell.html| title=Wieland F\u00f6rster.

In the end, in December 1972, working under conditions of increasing privation from which his health suffered, he was able to arrange an evidently candid meeting with [[Konrad Wolf]], the politically well connected president of the [[Academy of Arts, Berlin|National Arts Academy]], at which he spelled out his situation.    The timing was propitious, in that the country's new leader, [[Erich Honecker]], was cautiously trying to move the East German government beyond the unrelenting inflexibility of [[Walter Ulbricht|his predecessor]].   The exhibitions ban was lifted, and  F\u00f6rster found himself elected to membership of the [[Academy of Arts, Berlin|National Arts Academy]].   More generally, from now on, till the [[Die Wende|demise]] of the East German state in 1989/90, he became a (semi-detached and unconventional) member of the artistic establishment: his relationship with the state now reflected a certain level of mutual acceptance bordering on respect.<ref name=\"Mlekusch2012\"/>\n\nBetween 1979 and 1990 he served as fifth vice-president, with responsibility for the training of Master Students (''\"Meistersch\u00fcler\"'') at the [[Academy of Arts, Berlin|National Arts Academy]].

His father was employed in the transport and commercial sectors.<ref name=WFlautwww/>    In 1935 his father died as a result of wounds sustained during the [[First World War]], leaving his mother to raise the children under conditions of financial hardship.  She succeeded in distancing them from Nazi indoctrination.   As a school boy, between 1936 and 1944, Wieland rejected the Nazi system and pressures to take part in government sponsored uniformed organisations.   In 1944 he took an apprenticeship as a trainee technical draftsman at the Dresden municipal waterworks.<ref name=\"Mlekusch2012\">{{cite book|author=Monika Mlekusch|title=Biografie|work=Wieland F\u00f6rster: Werkverzeichnis der Plastiken und Skulpturen| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=it9dfzKHsWsC&pg=PA10| year=2012|publisher=LIT Verlag M\u00fcnster| isbn=978-3-643-50402-9| pages=9\u201317}}</ref>   Towards the end of 1944, still aged only 14, he was sent for four weeks to a [[Hitler Youth]] detention camp.

He was also conscripted into the local branch of the newly launched [[Volkssturm|German Home Guard (''\"Volksturm\"'')]], and it was as a member of the Home Guard that he experienced the [[Bombing of Dresden|English and American air attacks that destroyed the central districts of city]] one day after his fifteenth birthday, on the night of 13 February 1945.<ref name=WFlautDLR/>   In the chaos following the attacks he was able to escape from the Home Guard, remaining in his home district till war ended, formally on 8 May 1945, after which Dresden and the surrounding region of central Germany were [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|administered]] as the [[Soviet occupation]].   Technical draftsmanship was officially designated as women's work, and Wieland was required to undertake hands-on work (''\"als Rohrleger\"'') in industrial engineering.<ref name=BreifwechsellautPL/>\n\nOn 17 September 1946 he found himself taken in by the police and handed over to the [[NKVD]] after a neighbour denounced him on grounds of suspected possession of weapons.<ref name=BreifwechsellautPL/>    The background to the affair was an attempt to make the F\u00f6rster family exchange their home for rented accommodation, after the German police had blocked an attempt by the Communist authorities to make them pay rent for living in their own home.<ref name=\"Mlekusch2012\"/>   Wieland was initially sentenced to ten years of forced labour in [[Siberia]], but after three months of nightly interrogation, a Soviet military tribunal reduced the term to 7\u00bd years.   On 28 December 1946 he was interned at [[NKVD special camps in Germany 1945\u201349|NKVD \"Special Camp\" IV]], a concentration camp which the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|authorities]] had constructed  next to [[:de:Justizvollzugsanstalt Bautzen|the jail]] at [[Bautzen]].   As the camp commanders set about sorting out the prisoners fit for work to be transported to Siberia, a Soviet military doctor determined that Wieland F\u00f6rster was unfit for work.   He was therefore left behind in [[NKVD special camps in Germany 1945\u201349|NKVD \"Special Camp\" IV]].<ref name=\"Mlekusch2012\"/>   In the aftermath of war the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|authorities]] refused to discuss or even to acknowledge the continuing existence of concentration camps in the [[Soviet occupation zone|Soviet part]] of occupied Germany, but their all too physical presence never became increasingly hard to dispute.   By 1950 F\u00f6rster was in poor general health dangerously ill with [[Tuberculosis]] and on 21 January 1950, following a threatened investigation by the [[International Red Cross]], he was the beneficiary of a \"backdoor\" release, emerging from the camp without identity papers and without any formal pardon or other explanation.

It was in this new kind of [[one-party state|one-]][[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|party]] [[National Front (East Germany)|dictatorship]],  with its principal [[Constitution of East Germany|political]] and economic structures modelled on those of the [[Soviet Union]] itself, that F\u00f6rster built his life and career over the next four decades.   He abandoned his ambition to become a technical draftsman, but nevertheless returned to work with the Dresden municipal waterworks, employed in the planning department till 1953.<ref name=WFlautGH>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-himmel.de/en/Kuenstler/Wieland-Foerster/Vita_2_2.html|title=Wieland F\u00f6rster|publisher=Galerie Himmel, Dresden|accessdate=3 March 2017}}</ref>   During these years he was using his spare time to try out various artistic forms of expression, such as writing, music, theatre and advertising, along with the more visual arts.   In the Autumn/Fall of 1952 he took part in a public \"drawing event\" at the [[Dresden Academy of Fine Arts]] where the teachers encouraged him to enroll as a student.<ref name=\"Mlekusch2012\"/>\n\nHe applied to his employers to back his application to sponsor his application to study at [[Dresden Academy of Fine Arts|the academy]], but was turned down for reasons that involved the risk of \"Verb\u00fcrgerlichung\" (''loosely: \"bourgeoisization\"'').   He therefore made the application anyway, on his own responsibility, and was accepted.   He was a student at the [[Dresden Academy of Fine Arts]] between 1953 and 1958.<ref name=WFlautwww/>   He began his study of sculpting in 1953, taught by [[Walter Arnold (sculptor)|Walter Arnold]] and Arnold's assistant [[Gerd Jaeger]] .   Another of his teachers was [[Hans Steger (sculptor)|Hans Steger]].   The focus of the training at Dresden was on [[:de:Neoklassizismus (Bildende Kunst)|neoclassical form]], backed up by compulsory courses in drawing, on use of plaster casts and on nature.   The study of anatomy and history of art were also included and required.<ref name=\"Mlekusch2012\"/>\n\nBy his second year F\u00f6rster was already establishing contacts with representatives of the officially forbidden \"classical modern\" art movement.   By this time the [[Iron curtain|division]] [[Allied-occupied Germany|of Germany]] agreed between the [[Allies of World War II|Americans and the Soviets]] at [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]] at the beginning of 1945 had crystallised into  a permanent frontier, but the [[Inner German border|border]] between the two Germanies was still relatively porous, especially between [[West Berlin]] and the surrounding territories governed as [[East Germany]], and F\u00f6rster took the opportunity to visit [[Bernhard Heiliger]] in [[West Berlin|the west]].   [[Walter Arnold (sculptor)|Walter Arnold]], himself a consummate hands-on craftsman, helped a few of his students, whom he regarded as politically reliable, to deepen their understanding on the essential elements in figurative sculpture, by gaining experience with the works of the westerners [[Hermann Haller (sculptor)|Hermann Haller]] and [[Charles Despiau]].<ref name=\"Mlekusch2012\"/>   In his third year, required to produce a \"portrait from a 'photo\", F\u00f6rster chose as his subject [[Bertolt Brecht]], a long-standing icon of the German intellectual left but nevertheless at this stage ostracised by [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|the authorities]].

More generally, from now on, till the [[Die Wende|demise]] of the East German state in 1989/90, he became a (semi-detached and unconventional) member of the artistic establishment: his relationship with the state now reflected a certain level of mutual acceptance bordering on respect.<ref name=\"Mlekusch2012\"/>\n\nBetween 1979 and 1990 he served as fifth vice-president, with responsibility for the training of Master Students (''\"Meistersch\u00fcler\"'') at the [[Academy of Arts, Berlin|National Arts Academy]].   In 1985 he was appointed to a professorship.   Since 1991 he has also been a member of [[PEN Centre Germany]].   However, 1991 was also the year in which he resigned from the (formerly ''East'' German) National Arts Academy in protest at the inadequacy of the institution's willingness to investigate and disclose its role under the East German dictatorship.<ref name=WFlautwww/>  Following [[German reunification|reunification]], in 1991 he was obliged to relocate from his 16 M<small>2</small> studio to a small back yard which is where, despite by now suffering from serious heart disease, much of his later work was produced.   For his larger sandstone sculptures he used a piece of land he had acquired (and where he still lives) at [[:de:Wensickendorf|Wensickendorf]] near [[Oranienburg]], to the north of Berlin.<ref name=WFinWensickendorf>{{cite web|url=http://www.maz-online.de/Lokales/Oberhavel/Luther-in-Oranienburg|title=Luther in Oranienburg ...

His brother, 16 years his senior, was a soldier in the Waffen SS and died in Ukraine in 1943. Decades later, Uwe Timm approached his relationship with his father and brother in the critically acclaimed novel ''In my brother's shadow''.\n\nAfter working as a furrier, Timm studied Philosophy and German in [[Munich]] and Paris, achieving a PhD in German literature in 1971 with his thesis: ''The Problem of Absurdity in the Works of Albert Camus''. During his studies, Timm was engaged in leftist activities of the 1960s. He became a member of the [[Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund|Socialist German Student Union]] and was associated with [[Benno Ohnesorg]]. From 1973 to 1981 he was a member of the [[German Communist Party]]. Three times Timm has been called as a writer-in-residence to several universities in English-speaking countries: in 1981 to the [[University of Warwick]], in 1994 to [[Swansea]] and in 1997 to the [[Washington University in St. Louis]]. He has also been a lecturer at universities in Paderborn, Darmstadt, L\u00fcneburg and Frankfurt.\n\nTimm started publishing in the early 1970s and became known to a larger audience in Germany after one of his children's books, ''Rennschwein Rudi R\u00fcssel'', was turned into a movie. Today he is one of the most successful contemporary authors in Germany. His books ''Die Entdeckung der Currywurst ([[The Invention of Curried Sausage]])'' and ''Am Beispiels meines Bruders (In my brother's shadow, or literally: \"By my Brother's Example\")'' can both be found on the syllabi of German schools. His readers usually appreciate Timm's writing style, which he himself calls \"''die \u00c4sthetik des Alltags''\" (\"the aesthetics of everyday life\").<ref>''Erz\u00e4hlen und kein Ende'', A collection of speeches (1993)</ref> Timm imitates everyday storytelling by using everyday vocabulary and simple sentences and generally tries to imitate the way stories are orally told. His works often indirectly link with each other by taking up minor characters from one story and making this character the main character of another work. For example, a minor character like Frau Br\u00fccker from ''Johannisnacht'' is taken up as a main character in his book ''Die Entdeckung der Currywurst''. Timm's works also tend to have autobiographical features and often deal with the German past or are set in the German past.<ref>Hanjo Kersting, Axel Ruckaberle: \"Uwe Timm\", ''Kritisches Lexikon zur deutschsprachigen Gegenwartsliteratur (KLG)'', K\u00f6ln 2004.</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n*1995 [[Bayerischer Filmpreis|Bavarian Film Award]], Best Young People's Film<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bayern.de/Anlage19170/PreistraegerdesBayerischenFilmpreises-Pierrot.pdf | title=Preistraeger des Bayerischen Filmpreises | accessdate=20 March 2012 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819211539/http://www.bayern.de/Anlage19170/PreistraegerdesBayerischenFilmpreises-Pierrot.pdf | archivedate=19 August 2008 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n*1990 [[Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis]] for ''Rennschwein Rudi R\u00fcssel''\n*2009 [[Heinrich-B\u00f6ll-Preis]]\n*2012 [[Carl Zuckmayer Medal]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n*''Widerspr\u00fcche'', Poems (1971)\n*''Hei\u00dfer Sommer'' (1974)\n*''Wolfenb\u00fcttlerstr. 57'', Poems (1977)\n*''Morenga'' (1978)\n*''Kerbels Flucht'' (1980)\n*''Die deutschen Kolonien'', Photo book (1981)\n*''Die Zugmaus'', Children's book (1981)\n*''Die Piratenamsel'', Children's book (1983)\n*''Der Mann auf dem Hochrad'', Children's book (1984)\n*''Der Schlangenbaum'' (1986)\n*''Rennschwein Rudi R\u00fcssel'', Children's book (1989)\n*''Vogel, friss die Feige nicht'' (1989)\n*''Der Kopfj\u00e4ger'' (1991)\n*''Die Piratenamsel'', Children's book (1991)\n*''Erz\u00e4hlen und kein Ende'', A collection of speeches (1993)\n*''Die Entdeckung der Currywurst'' (1993)\n*''Der Schatz auf Pagensand'' (1995)\n*''Johannisnacht'' (1996)\n*''Nicht morgen, nicht gestern'', Short stories (1999)\n*''Rot'', novel (2001), awarded the 2003 [[Schubart-Literaturpreis]]<ref>[[Aalen|City of Aalen]].
