Canada had a population of 3.5 million, residing in the large expanse from Cape Breton to just beyond the Great Lakes, usually within a hundred miles or so of the [[Canada\u2013United States border]]. One in three Canadians was French, and about 100,000 were aboriginal (First Nation, Inuit, M\u00e9tis). It was a rural country composed of small farms. With a population of 115,000, Montreal was the largest city, followed by Toronto and Quebec at about 60,000. Pigs roamed the muddy streets of Ottawa, the small new national capital.\n\nBesides subsistence agriculture, hoi ya'll whats good in the hood the economy was based on exports of lumber, fish and grain, and the import of investment capital from London and New York. Factories were small, except for those making farm implements. Overall the economy prospered in the first years of Confederation, but a world-wide depression 1873-1896 severely hurt the export economy, reduced the inflow of foreign capital, and reduced the flow of immigration. Economic growth of total GNP (in constant dollars) averaged only 2.4 percent per year, 1870 to 1896, then surged to 6.2 percent, 1897\u20131913. Part of that increase was due to population growth. The rate of growth of GNP per capita was 1.3% , 1870 to 1896, then surged to 2.6 percent, 1897\u20131913. The growth rate was respectable, but lower than that of the United States, and fuelled a sense of disappointment that Confederation had not delivered on its promise of prosperity.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Kenneth |last1=Norrie |author-link1=Kenneth Norrie |first2=Douglas |last2=Owram |title=A History of the Canadian Economy |publisher=Harcourt Brace |date=1991 |pp=[https://archive.org/details/historyofcanadia0000norr_v9a5/page/293 293\u201397] |isbn=978-0-7747-3087-7 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofcanadia0000norr_v9a5/page/293 }}</ref> \n[[File:John A Macdonald election poster 1891.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative]] election poster from 1891, featuring John A.

The Anglophones took pride in their Britishness and in their refusal to be swallowed up by the United States. Baseball and lacrosse were favourite sports. Cultural facilities were limited. There were only two public libraries in the entire new country; half the adults in Quebec could not read. Hard drinking in all ranks was the norm; in fact, the new prime minister, [[John A. Macdonald]], was sometimes drunk in public. Politically, the new nation was defined by its practicality, realism, and stoicism; it had little interest in theory or esthetics. Much more important was loyalty to family, church, political party, and Queen Victoria. Historians later emphasized the iconic phrase \"Peace, Order and Good Government\" (\"paix, ordre et bon gouvernement\") as founding constitutional principles, but at the time it was rarely quoted.<ref>{{cite book |first=Richard J. |last=Gwyn |author-link=Richard Gwyn |title=Nation Maker: Sir John A.

So too did increasingly bitter disputes on language issues, especially the role of the French language outside Qu\u00e9bec. Ethno-religious tensions flared between the Francophones and the Anglophones, between the Catholic Irish (\"greens\") and the Protestant Irish (\"Orange\"), and between the whites and the Asians on the West Coast.\n\n== Confederation ==\n{{Main|Canadian Confederation}}\nIn the 1860s, the British were concerned with the possibility of an American assault on Canada in the wake of the [[American Civil War]]. Britain also feared that American settlers might expand to the north, into land that was technically British but which was sparsely settled. There were also problems with raids into Canada launched by the [[Fenian Brotherhood]], a group of Irish Americans who wanted to pressure Britain into granting independence to Ireland. Canada was already essentially a self-governing colony since the 1840s, and Britain no longer felt it was worth the expense of keeping it as a colony. Both sides would, it was felt, be better off politically and economically if Canada was independent. These factors led to the first serious discussions about real, formal political union in Canada. However, there were internal political obstacles to overcome first. The Province of Canada had little success in keeping a stable government for any period of time; the Tories, led by [[John A. Macdonald]] and [[George-\u00c9tienne Cartier]], were constantly at odds with the \"Clear Grits\" led by [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]]. In 1864, the two parties decided to unite in the \"[[Great Coalition]]\". This was an important step towards [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Donald |last=Creighton |title=The Road to Confederation: The Emergence of Canada, 1863-1867 |url=https://archive.org/details/roadtoconfederat0000crei |url-access=registration |date=1965}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fathers of Confederation LAC c001855.jpg|left|thumb|350px|\"Fathers of Confederation\" meet in Quebec City]]\nMeanwhile, the colonies further east, [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]], [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], were also discussing a political union with each other. Representatives from the Province of Canada joined them at the [[Charlottetown Conference]] in [[Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island]] in 1864 to discuss a union of all the colonies, and these discussions were extended into the [[Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Conference]] of 1864. While there was opposition in each of the colonies, only Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland decided to remain outside of the planned Confederation. In 1867, representatives of the other colonies travelled to Britain to finalize the union, which was granted by the ''[[British North America Act, 1867|British North America Act]]'' (BNA Act) on July 1, 1867.<ref>{{cite book |first=W. L. |last=Morton |title=The Critical Years: The Union of British North America, 1857-1873 |publisher=McClelland and Stewart |volume=Volume 12 |series=Canadian Centenary Series |date=1968 |isbn=}}</ref>\n\nEarly drafts of the BNA Act showed that Macdonald and the other [[Fathers of Confederation]] had viewed the new nation as a kingdom, calling for the official name of the country to be the \"[[Monarchy in Canada|Kingdom of Canada]]\". Though it is still considered that Canada became a \"kingdom in her own right\" in 1867, it was felt by the [[Colonial Office]] in London that a name such as Kingdom of Canada was too \"premature\" and \"pretentious.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=John |last=Farthing |first2=Judith |last2=Robinson |title=Freedom Wears a Crown |publisher=Kingswood House |location=Toronto |date=1957}}</ref> Instead the term \"[[Canada's Name#Adoption of Dominion|Dominion]]\" was adopted. In 1879, July 1 was formally established as ''[[Dominion Day]]'' to celebrate Confederation. While the BNA Act gave Canada a high degree of autonomy within the [[British Empire]], this autonomy extended only to internal affairs. External affairs, such as border negotiations with the United States, were still controlled from Britain.\n\n==Social and political tensions==\nCanada's material condition was weak, 1867\u20131896, and the psychological mood became increasingly embittered. Historian Arthur Lower concludes that in the late 1880s, \u201cnever before or since has Canada reached such a low state; never has there been so little evidence among its people of national spirit.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |first=Arthur R.M. |last=Lower |author-link=Arthur R.

Canada industrialized very slowly, and therefore generated few high-paying jobs. The hard-scrabble farms were hard-pressed to compete with American agriculture. Immigrants were bypassing Canada for the fast-growing United States, where high wages and new jobs and fresh lands were awaiting the ambitious. Many Canadians themselves emigrated to the States. Anglophones went to New York, Michigan and Minnesota. Quebeckers move south into the textile mills of New England.<ref>{{cite book |first=Gerard J. |last=Brault |title=The French-Canadian Heritage in New England |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gXbC2EFS08gC&pg=PA51 |year=1986 |publisher=University Press of New England |page=51 |isbn=978-0-8745-1359-2}}</ref> A half-million people left the Maritimes, and few newcomers arrived.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Patricia A. |last=Thornton |title=The Problem of Out-Migration from Atlantic Canada, 1871-1921: A New Look |journal=[[Acadiensis]] |date=Autumn 1985 |volume=XV |issue=1 |pp=3\u201334 |issn=0044-5851 |url=http://journals.hil.unb.ca/index.php/Acadiensis/article/viewPDFInterstitial/12079/12923 |jstor=30302704}}</ref> The Fathers of Confederation had envisioned fast economic growth through building a transcontinental railroad network. But it was not finished until the late 1880s, and it seemed to produce more frustration and dismay than prosperity.<ref>{{harvp|Lower|1977|pp=380-81, 395-96}}</ref> In Manitoba, for example, local businessmen and speculators were outraged when the Canadian Pacific Railway suddenly shifted its operations away from the center of the province, to the southern edge, and its lawyers and politicians blocked the opening of rival lines. Canadians distrusted their politicians, and repeatedly sought out and discovered corrupt deals, especially financial contracts made by and for the benefit of politicians. There was a widespread sense that Confederation had been a failure. Provincial politicians sought to weaken the powers of the central government, and there were few local voices speaking in support of it.<ref>{{harvp|Lower|1977|pp=381-85, 395-96}}</ref>\n \nReligious, language and ethnic differences worsened decade by decade. European Canadians were highly religious, but the Protestants and Catholics hated each other. The Francophones saw their traditional culture under siege by the Anglophones, who controlled business and finance across Canada, including Qu\u00e9bec's, and systematically blocked the expansion of French language schools outside Qu\u00e9bec. The hanging of Louis Riel for treason in 1885 convinced Francophones they were under attack, and permanently undermined the Conservative base in Qu\u00e9bec. French nationalism emerged as a powerful force that is still a dominant factor in Qu\u00e9bec's history. Inside the Irish community, the longstanding bitterness between the [[Orange Order in Canada|Protestant Orange]] and the Catholic green continued unabated. The Orange boasted of the supremacy of their Anglo-Saxon civilization and Protestant culture over the backward, medieval, priest-ridden Catholicism. They ridiculed the French and Irish races as backward and ultimately doomed.{{efn|\"Race\u201d was a synonym for what the 21st century calls an [[ethnic group]].<ref>{{cite book |first=J.R. |last=Miller |title=Equal Rights: The Jesuits' Estates Act Controversy |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |date=1979 |pp=27\u201334 |isbn=978-0-7735-0302-1}}</ref>}}<ref>{{cite book |first=P.

Intermarriage was rare and indeed friendships and casual communication were not sought after. The Catholic Irish, however, joined with Protestants to block the expansion of French schools outside Qu\u00e9bec, thereby causing severe tensions inside the Catholic community. Anglophones generally trusted Britain and the British Empire, but London had different ideas. London pushed for Confederation after the American Civil War so as to avoid the enormous expense of defending Canada against a possible American invasion. In the [[Alaska Boundary Dispute]] it demonstrated that the goodwill of the United States outweighed Canadian interests. Many businessmen, on the other hand, wanted to join the United States, leading to political tension in the upper-class clubs and boardrooms.<ref>{{cite book |first=Donald Frederick |last=Warner |title=The Idea of Continental Union: Agitation for the Annexation of Canada to the United States, 1849-1893 |publisher=Mississippi Valley Historical Association |date=1960}}</ref> \n\nFinally after 1896, with the opening of the rich Western wheat plans, did the Canadian economy recover. Immigration surged, and a spirit of optimism returned to Canada.<ref>{{harvp|Lower|1977|pp=403-413}}</ref>\n\n==First Nations==\nThe new country was led by Prime Minister John A. Macdonald. As part of Confederation, Canada was now responsible for existing treaty obligations with First Nations. Under Macdonald, Canada bought [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[North-Western Territory]] from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1869. This was unceded First Nations territory and the new government continued the British policy of acquiring land through treaty negotiations with several First Nations to enable European settlement. The exception was the existing colony of [[British Columbia]], which did not enter into treaties with the Coastal First Nations.\n\nThere were no full-scale Indian wars such as those fought in the United States as Canada expanded into First Nations territory in the Prairies.<ref>{{cite book |first=Bruce |last=Vandervort |title=Indian Wars of Canada, Mexico and the United States, 1812-1900 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H-SAAgAAQBAJ&pg=PR12 |year=2007 |publisher=Routledge |page=xii}}</ref> However, the expansion was not fully peaceful. A [[Metis (people)|M\u00e9tis]] uprising led to the formation of Manitoba in 1870. The M\u00e9tis and some First Nations allies launched a small-scale rebellion in 1885 that was put down militarily. Smaller-scale skirmishes occurred between whites and native peoples. \n\nThe period after Confederation was a period of hardship for many Prairie First Nations. The 1870s saw the disappearance of the herds of wild [[bison]] on the prairie, (partly due to illnesses passed from domesticated cattle). Many natives were affected by famine and disease introduced by Europeans and sought food and medical support when signing treaties with Canada. Aid to the natives was a political issue and federal allocations for the Department of Indian Affairs to provide medical support and food destined for famine relief were reduced by Macdonald's government.<ref name=\"daschuk\">{{cite web |url=http://activehistory.ca/2013/12/an-unsettling-prairie-history-a-review-of-james-daschuks-clearing-the-plains/ |title=An Unsettling Prairie History: A Review of James Daschuk\u2019s Clearing the Plains |first=Kevin |last=Plummer |date=December 5, 2013 |accessdate=February 3, 2020}}</ref> The period saw epidemics of [[smallpox]] and [[tuberculosis]] among the Plains First Nations. Partly due to malnutrition, tuberculosis ravaged the reserves in the 1880s.<ref name=\"daschuk\"/>\n\nUnder Prime Minister [[Alexander Mackenzie (politician)|Alexander Mackenzie]], Canada introduced the ''[[Indian Act]]'' in 1876 to govern its relations with the First Nations. Canada continued the pre-Confederation policy of 'civilizing' the First Nations people through \"enfranchisement.\" To become full British subjects, natives had to give up their Indian status. Canada banned some First Nations customs, for example, the [[Potlatch ban]]. The Canadian government introduced [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential schools]], where First Nation children were taught to forget their traditions. The policies would continue well into the 20th century. The [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada]] would later term the school system to be a case of cultural genocide.<ref name=\"TRCExec\">{{cite web |title=Honouring the Truth, Reconciling for the Future: Summary of the Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada |url=http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/File/2015/Findings/Exec_Summary_2015_05_31_web_o.pdf |website=National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation |publisher=Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada |accessdate=June 28, 2016 |date=May 31, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706170855/http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/File/2015/Findings/Exec_Summary_2015_05_31_web_o.pdf |archivedate=July 6, 2016  }}</ref>\n\n=== The Red River Rebellion ===\n{{Main|Red River Rebellion}}\n[[File:ProvisionalMetisGovernment.jpg|thumb|200px|The M\u00e9tis Red River Provisional Government]]\nThe new government of the confederated Canada encouraged westward settlement in the prairies. However, the people who already lived there, natives and M\u00e9tis, descendants of the children of natives and French Canadian fur traders, were opposed to waves of English-speaking settlers buying their lands. The M\u00e9tis of the Red River settlement (near present-day [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]]), led by [[Louis Riel]], formed a provisional government to negotiate with the Canadian government, although these negotiations quickly fell apart. Riel led the [[Red River Rebellion]] in 1869 and 1870, during which he executed an uppity [[Orange Order of Canada|Orange Protestant Irishman]], causing an uproar among Protestant English Canadians. Macdonald sent the militia to put down the rebellion, which they quickly did, and Riel fled to the United States. Many of the M\u00e9tis moved west into unsettled areas of Saskatchewan.\n\nThe Rebellion led to the creation of the province of [[Manitoba]] in 1870, with laws intended to protect the rights of the natives, M\u00e9tis, French-speakers and English-speakers, Catholics and Protestants.<ref>{{cite book |first=W.L. |last=Morton |title=Manitoba: a History |publisher=University of Toronto Press |date=1967}}</ref>\n\n=== The North-West Rebellion of 1885===\n{{Main|North-West Rebellion}}\n[[File:MetisPrisoners.jpg|thumb|right|250px|M\u00e9tis and First Nation prisoners following the rebellion, August 1885.]]\nAfter the Red River Rebellion, many M\u00e9tis moved west to what is now [[Saskatchewan]]. However, with the relentless westward expansion of the railway and the steady flow of settlers, they feared their way of life was threatened. In 1884 Riel was called upon by the M\u00e9tis leadership, now based in Saskatchewan, to articulate M\u00e9tis grievances to the Canadian government. Unexpectedly, he went beyond petitions and organized a military force that escalated into a small war, the [[North-West Rebellion]] of 1885. Riel was deserted by Catholic missionaries distressed by his heresies, and by all his former white allies. He was supported by the First Nations Cree and Assiniboine of Saskatchewan who joined the rebellion. Ottawa used the new rail lines to send in thousands of combat soldiers as well as Mounties and militia. They decisively defeated the rebel forces at their capital at [[Batoche, Saskatchewan|Batoche]]. Some rebels escaped to the U.S. Riel was captured and convicted of [[Treason Act 1351|high treason]]. Rejecting many protests and popular appeals, especially from Quebec, Prime Minister Macdonald decided to hang him. The M\u00e9tis submitted sullenly; there was no further Indian war.<ref>{{harvp|Gwyn|2012|pp=434\u2013493}}</ref>\n\nRiel was idealized as a heroic victim by [[Francophones]]; his execution had a lasting negative impact on Canada, polarizing the new nation along ethnic and religious lines. Riel's historical reputation has long been polarized between portrayals as a dangerous half-insane religious fanatic and rebel against the Canadian nation or by contrast a heroic rebel who fought to protect his Francophone people from the unfair encroachments of an Anglophone national government. He is increasingly celebrated as a proponent of multiculturalism, although that downplays his primary commitment to M\u00e9tis nationalism and political independence.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first=George F.

It cost about $5 million, plus millions more to complete the Canadian Pacific Railway.

British Columbia had been important for British control of the Pacific Ocean and was a centre of the fur trade between Britain, the United States, Russia, Spain, and China. It did not participate in the original Confederation conferences but agreed to join Canada in 1871 when Macdonald promised to build a [[transcontinental railroad]] to it. The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] and the [[Dominion Land Survey]] were started soon after. \n[[File:Canada provinces 1881-1886.png|thumb|200px|left|Canadian provinces, 1881-1886]]\nIn 1873, Prince Edward Island finally accepted the inducements on offer to pay its railway debts and buy-out of the last of the colony's absentee landlords.

First, it wanted to knit the far-flung provinces together, and second, it wanted to maximize trade inside Canada and minimize trade with the United States, to avoid becoming an economic satellite. The [[Intercolonial Railway]] built 1872 - 1876, linked the Maritimes to Quebec and Ontario and contributed to an ice-free winter route to Britain. Diplomatically, it avoided the necessity of getting Washington's permission in wartime to ship munitions across the American state of Maine.  In a larger perspective, it provided the model for a government-owned and operated railway system.<ref>Ken Cruikshank, \"The People's Railway: The Intercolonial Railway and the Canadian Public Enterprise Experience.\" ''Acadiensis'' 16#1 (1986): 78\u2013100.</ref>\n\nNo less than three transcontinental lines were built to the west coast, but that was far more than the traffic would bear, making the system simply too expensive.  The priority, however, was national unity more than the national budget.<ref>Den Otter, Andy Albert, ''The Philosophy of Railways: The Transcontinental Railway Idea in British North America'' (U of Toronto Press, 1997.</ref>\n\nOne after another, the federal government was forced to take over the lines and cover their deficits. Since most of the equipment was imported from Britain or the United States, and most of the products carried were from farms, mines or forests, there was little stimulation to manufacturing. On the other hand, the railways were essential to the growth of the wheat regions in the Prairies, and to the expansion of coal mining, lumbering, and paper-making. Improvements to the St. Lawrence waterway system continued apace, and many short lines were built to river ports.<ref>J.A. Eagle, ''The Canadian Pacific and the Development of Western Canada'' (Kingston, 1989).</ref>\n\nBy 1875, the government was spending a fourth of its budget on building the {{convert|4000|km|mile}}-long Canadian Pacific, as well as finishing the Intercolonial. Arrangements with the Canadian Pacific Railway syndicate in 1880 brought on board the leading bankers and financiers in Canada as well as American and European bankers.

The railway also opened coal and lead mines, fixed establishments press service, and open telegraph lines. It created tourist hotels in the mountains, most famously at [[Banff, Alberta]] and nearby [[Chateau Lake Louise]], as well as landmark stations in major cities. The CPR built a fleet to enable fast passenger and freight service between Europe and Asia via Canada. Connections to American railways proved valuable. As the American frontier was largely closed by 1890, migrants looking to settle virgin land moved from the United States into the Prairie provinces. They shipped their wheat out by rail, and ordered supplies from Ontario.<ref>{{cite book |first=James Blaine |last=Hedges |title=Building the Canadian West: The Land and Colonization Policies of the Canadian Pacific Railway |url=https://archive.org/details/buildingthecanad009200mbp |date=1939}}</ref>\n\nA scandal erupted in 1873. Macdonald and the Conservative government faced a major political crisis when it was revealed that the Canadian Pacific Railway Company had helped fund Macdonald's [[1872 Canadian federal election|election campaign in 1872]]. A [[1874 Canadian federal election|new election was called in 1874]], and [[Alexander Mackenzie (politician)|Alexander Mackenzie]] became prime minister. The public's suspicion of Macdonald was overcome by 1878 when Macdonald and the Conservatives were re-elected.\n\n=== Macdonald's \"National Policy\" ===\n{{Main|National Policy}}\nAfter being restored as Prime Minister, Macdonald introduced the [[National Policy]], a system of protective tariffs meant to strengthen the Canadian economy. Part of the policy was the completion of the railroad, which would allow products to be transferred more easily across the country. It was also a response to the United States, which had a much stronger economy that threatened to overwhelm Canada; the United States had a trade reciprocity treaty with the United Province of Canada from 1854 to 1866 but abrogated the treaty before Confederation. Many people believed this policy was only beneficial to Ontario, as the Maritimes especially depended on trade with the United States. While it was somewhat beneficial for asserting Canadian independence, it was not very useful in the less industrial Maritimes and West.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Vernon C. |last=Fowke |title=National Policy and Western Development in North America |journal=Journal of Economic History |date=December 1956 |volume=16 |issue=4 |pp=461\u2013479 |jstor=2114691}}</ref>\n\n=== Ontario's quest for provincial rights ===\nWhile Macdonald may have hoped that the BNA Act would provide the central government in Ottawa with a strong hand, some of the provinces, particularly Ontario under the leadership of its premier [[Oliver Mowat]], pushed for interpretations of the constitution that favoured provincial rather than Dominion interests. Mowat, premier from 1872 until 1896, became the \"implacable enemy\" of Prime Minister Macdonald<ref>{{cite book |first=John |last=Ibbitson |author-link=John Ibbitson |title=Loyal No More: Ontario's Struggle for a Separate Destiny |publisher=HarperCollins |date=2001 |p=[https://archive.org/details/loyalnomoreontar0000ibbi_j9w0/page/40 40] |url=https://archive.org/details/loyalnomoreontar0000ibbi_j9w0 |url-access=registration |isbn= |ref=harv}}</ref> as a result of a series of court decisions regarding provincial jurisdiction over liquor licences, use of streams, and mineral rights. The boundary between Ontario and Manitoba became a hotly contested matter, with the federal government attempting to extend Manitoba's jurisdiction eastward to the Great Lakes, into the areas that Ontario claimed. In 1882 Premier Mowat threatened to pull Ontario from Confederation over the issue. Mowat sent police into the disputed territory to assert Ontario's claims, while Manitoba (at the behest of the national government) did the same.<ref>{{harvp|Ibbitson|2001|p=46}}</ref> The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in Britain, serving as Canada's highest appeal court, repeatedly issued rulings taking the side of provincial rights. These decisions would to some extent neutralize the power of the central government, creating a more decentralized federation. John Ibbitson writes that by 1914:\n{{quote|text=Confederation had evolved into a creation beyond John A. Macdonald's worst nightmare. Powerful, independent provinces, sovereign within their own spheres, manipulated the rights of property, levied their own taxes\u2014even income taxes, in a few cases\u2014exploited their natural resources, and managed schools, hospitals, and relief for the poor, while a weak and ineffectual central government presided over not much of anything in the drab little capital on the banks of the Ottawa.<ref>{{harvp|Ibbitson|2001|p=49}}</ref>}}\n\n=== The Manitoba Schools Question ===\n{{Main|Manitoba Schools Question}}\nAfter the Red River Rebellion and the entrance of Manitoba into Confederation, settlers from English Canada arrived in the new province in greater numbers. In 1890, the provincial government passed the ''Manitoba Schools Act'', abolishing government funding for Catholic schools and abolishing French as an official language - contrary to the ''[[Manitoba Act]]'' that created the province. This led to another federal political crisis, and by 1896, Prime Minister [[Mackenzie Bowell]] was forced to resign. [[Wilfrid Laurier]], a Catholic from Quebec, became prime minister. Laurier developed a compromise stating that French would be used in schools when there were a significant number of French-speaking students; this compromise was denounced by both sides but was recognized as the only possible solution. However, along with the execution of Louis Riel, the Manitoba Schools Question led to an increase of French Canadian nationalism.<ref>{{cite book |editor-first=Lovell |editor-last=Clark |title=The Manitoba School Question: majority rule or minority rights? |publisher=Copp Clark |date=1968}} historians debate the issue</ref>\n\n== Immigration to the West ==\n[[File:Ad to attract Immigrants to wheat belt in 1898.jpg|thumb|390px|Canada sought immigrants from Europe, especially farmers; cartoon by [[John Wilson Bengough]] from Toronto ''Globe'' May 19, 1898]]\n{{further|Last Best West}}\nWhile the National Policy, CPR and ''[[Dominion Lands Act]]'' had been in place for several decades, mass immigration to Canada's prairie regions only got underway around 1896. Why it began then is a matter of debate among historians. John Dales argued that it was a combination of rising wheat prices, cheaper ocean transport costs, technological change, new varieties of wheat, and the scarcity of land in the United States. Norry does not view any of these developments as being important and instead argues that new methods of [[dry farming]] lead to the breakthrough. Recently, Ward had argued that technological change was the most important factor, with a number of different inventions becoming cheap and reliable enough to be widely used around this period. The period of western settlement was one of the most prosperous in Canadian history. From 1896 to 1911, Canada had the world's fastest-growing economy. Immigration from Eastern Europe and the eastern parts of the former Austro-Hungarian empire brought many old-world farmers to settle the west and despite their lack of knowledge of the English language, many adapted quickly to the farming environment which was somewhat similar to their original homelands.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Klondike Gold Rush===\n{{Main|Klondike Gold Rush}}\n\n[[File:Klondike camp Yukon head.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Miner's camp at the head of the Yukon River]]\nIn August 1896, a party led by [[Skookum Jim Mason]] discovered gold on a tributary of the [[Klondike River]]. After the discovery was publicized in 1897, an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 people braved numerous hardships to reach the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]] goldfields in the winter and spring of 1897\u201398. With the influx of American stampeders, the government decided to relieve the [[Northwest Territories|North-West Territories]]' administration from the task of controlling the sudden boom of population, economic activity and influx of non-Canadians. On June 13, 1898, the [[Yukon]] became a separate territory. In 1901, after many had gone back, the [[Census in Canada|Census]] put the population of the territory at 27,219, a figure that was not reached again until 1991. The influx of people greatly stimulated mineral exploration in other parts of the Yukon and led to two subsidiary gold rushes in [[Atlin, British Columbia]] and [[Nome, Alaska]] as well as a number of mini-rushes. Transportation needs to the goldfields led to the construction of the [[White Pass and Yukon Route]].\n\n=== Alaska Boundary Dispute ===\n{{main|Alaska Boundary Dispute}}\nThe precise Alaska-Canada boundary became important when gold was discovered in the Klondike. Miners had to enter through American Alaska to get there. Canada wanted its own Pacific port and rejected American offers to lease it one. Instead, it claimed its historic boundary with Russian Alaska included the [[Lynn Canal]] and the port of [[Skagway]], both occupied by the U.S. The dispute went to arbitration in 1903 but, to the anger of Canadians, the British delegate sided with the Americans. It was a matter of ensuring good relations between London and Washington, at the expense of Canada. The resentment contributed to the defeat of [[Wilfrid Laurier]] and his Liberal Party in the 1911 election as they proposed a reciprocal trade treaty with the U.S. that would lower tariff barriers.<ref>{{cite book |editor-first=John A. |editor-last=Munro |title=The Alaska Boundary Dispute |publisher=Copp Clark |date=1970}} provides primary and secondary sources.</ref>\n\n=== Rising Anti-Asian sentiment in British Columbia ===\n[[File:Demand-oriental-exclusion-1907-Vancouver.jpg|thumb|370px|Exclusionist cartoon in ''Saturday Sunset'' magazine, (Vancouver, August 24, 1907.)

Then came the introduction of the first [[Head tax (Canada)|Chinese Head Tax]] legislation passed in 1885, which was in response to a growing number of [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] working on the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. Subsequent increases in the head tax in 1900 and 1903 limited Chinese entrants to Canada. [[Anti-Oriental Riots (Vancouver)|In 1907 a major riot against Asians from India, Japan and China took place in Vancouver, BC.]] In 1923 the government passed the ''Chinese Immigration Act'' which excluded Chinese from entering Canada altogether between 1923 and 1947.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Howard H. |last=Sugimoto |title=The Vancouver Riot and Its International Significance |journal=Pacific Northwest Quarterly |date=October 1973 |volume=64 |issue=4 |pp=163\u2013174 |jstor=40489721}}</ref>\n\nCanadians in British Columbia grew increasingly fearful and angry about immigration from Asia that they perceived threatened their jobs and the British culture and standard of living in B.C.

Serious anti-Asian riots erupted in Vancouver in 1887 and 1907. In the 1907 riot a mob of English-Canadian rioters attacked Chinese- and Japanese-Canadian businesses but met stiff resistance from the Japanese community. By 1923 the dominion government passed the ''[[Chinese Immigration Act]]'', which prohibited all Chinese immigration until it was repealed in 1947. [[Sikh]]s had to face an amended ''Immigration Act'' in 1908 that required Sikhs to have $200 on arrival in Canada, and immigration would be allowed only if the passenger had arrived by continuous journey from India, which was impossible. In 1914 the ''[[Komagata Maru incident|Komagata Maru]]'' arrived in Vancouver with 376 Sikhs aboard, but only 24 were admitted. The Japanese in 1942 were rounded up and sent to inland camps for the duration of the war. Asian-Canadians were finally given equal status and the vote in 1947. For discriminating against Chinese immigrants in past periods, an official government apology and compensations were announced on June 22, 2006.\n<ref>{{harvp|Barman|2007|pp=156-157}}</ref>\n\n==Popular culture==\nCanadians in the 19th century came to believe themselves possessed of a unique \"northern character,\" due to the long, harsh winters that only those of hardy body and mind could survive.

Along with some Americans, he also hoped for a shift of focus towards North America, a policy often known as \"continentalism.\" However, in 1899, the British immediately assumed Canada would send military support to the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] in South Africa, and there was indeed enormous support for military action from English Canada. French Canada was strongly opposed to military support for Britain's imperialist wars. The opposition was led by [[Henri Bourassa]], who, like Laurier, preferred a united, independent Canada. Bourassa denounced Laurier when Laurier eventually decided to allow a volunteer force to fight in the war, even though the other option would have been calling up an official army.\n\nAs Prime Minister, [[Wilfrid Laurier|Laurier]] successfully brought [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Alberta]] into Confederation in 1905, carving those provinces out of the Northwest Territories. He felt Canada was on the verge of becoming a world power and declared that the 20th century would \"belong to Canada\". However, he faced even more criticism when he introduced the ''[[Naval Service Act]]'' in 1910. It was meant to make Canada less dependent on Britain and British imperialism, but Bourassa believed the British would now call on the Canadian navy whenever it was needed, just as they did with the Canadian army. Pro-British imperialists were also opposed to the attempt to remove Canada from the Empire. The Naval Service Bill led to Laurier's downfall in the [[1911 Canadian federal election|election of 1911]]. Conservatives led by [[Robert Laird Borden]] attacked reciprocity with the United States, warning that strong economic links would weaken the Empire and allow the neighbour to increasingly take over the economy.\n\nBritish politicians at the time and historians ever since have explored whether the British Empire was too expensive for the British budget. [[Joseph Chamberlain]] thought so but he had little success at the Imperial Conference of 1902 asking overseas partners to increase their contribution. Canada and Australia spoke of funding a warship\u2014the Canadian Senate voted it down in 1913.<ref>{{cite book|author=Martin Thornton|title=Churchill, Borden and Anglo-Canadian Naval Relations, 1911\u201314|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-RZEAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT82|year=2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|pages=82\u201385}}</ref> Meanwhile, the Royal Navy adjusted its war plans to focus on Germany, economizing on defending against lesser threats in peripheral areas such as the Pacific and Indian Oceans.

Canada had a population of 3.5 million, residing in the large expanse from Cape Breton to just beyond the Great Lakes, usually within a hundred miles or so of the [[Canada\u2013United States border]]. One in three Canadians was French, and about 100,000 were aboriginal (First Nation, Inuit, M\u00e9tis). It was a rural country composed of small farms. With a population of 115,000, Montreal was the largest city, followed by Toronto and Quebec at about 60,000. Pigs roamed the muddy streets of Ottawa, the small new national capital.\n\nBesides subsistence agriculture, the economy was based on exports of lumber, fish and grain, and the import of investment capital from London and New York. Factories were small, except for those making farm implements. Overall the economy prospered in the first years of Confederation, but a world-wide depression 1873-1896 severely hurt the export economy, reduced the inflow of foreign capital, and reduced the flow of immigration. Economic growth of total GNP (in constant dollars) averaged only 2.4 percent per year, 1870 to 1896, then surged to 6.2 percent, 1897\u20131913. Part of that increase was due to population growth. The rate of growth of GNP per capita was 1.3% , 1870 to 1896, then surged to 2.6 percent, 1897\u20131913. The growth rate was respectable, but lower than that of the United States, and fuelled a sense of disappointment that Confederation had not delivered on its promise of prosperity.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Kenneth |last1=Norrie |author-link1=Kenneth Norrie |first2=Douglas |last2=Owram |title=A History of the Canadian Economy |publisher=Harcourt Brace |date=1991 |pp=[https://archive.org/details/historyofcanadia0000norr_v9a5/page/293 293\u201397] |isbn=978-0-7747-3087-7 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofcanadia0000norr_v9a5/page/293 }}</ref> \n[[File:John A Macdonald election poster 1891.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative]] election poster from 1891, featuring John A.

Much more important was loyalty to family, church, political party, and Queen Victoria.

So too did increasingly bitter disputes on language issues, especially the role of the French language outside Qu\u00e9bec. Ethno-religious tensions flared between the Francophones and the Anglophones, between the Catholic Irish (\"greens\") and the Protestant Irish (\"Orange\"), and between the whites and the Asians on the West Coast.\n\n== Confederation ==\n{{Main|Canadian Confederation}}\nIn the 1860s, the British were concerned with the possibility of an American assault on Canada in the wake of the [[American Civil War]]. Britain also feared that American settlers might expand to the north, into land that was technically British but which was sparsely settled. There were also problems with raids into Canada launched by the [[Fenian Brotherhood]], a group of Irish Americans who wanted to pressure Britain into granting independence to Ireland. Canada was already essentially a self-governing colony since the 1840s, and Britain no longer felt it was worth the expense of keeping it as a colony. Both sides would, it was felt, be better off politically and economically if Canada was independent. These factors led to the first serious discussions about real, formal political union in Canada. However, there were internal political obstacles to overcome first. The Province of Canada had little success in keeping a stable government for any period of time; the Tories, led by [[John A. Macdonald]] and [[George-\u00c9tienne Cartier]], were constantly at odds with the \"Clear Grits\" led by [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]]. In 1864, the two parties decided to unite in the \"[[Great Coalition]]\". This was an important step towards [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Donald |last=Creighton |title=The Road to Confederation: The Emergence of Canada, 1863-1867 |url=https://archive.org/details/roadtoconfederat0000crei |url-access=registration |date=1965}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fathers of Confederation LAC c001855.jpg|left|thumb|350px|\"Fathers of Confederation\" meet in Quebec City]]\nMeanwhile, the colonies further east, [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]], [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], were also discussing a political union with each other. Representatives from the Province of Canada joined them at the [[Charlottetown Conference]] in [[Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island]] in 1864 to discuss a union of all the colonies, and these discussions were extended into the [[Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Conference]] of 1864. While there was opposition in each of the colonies, only Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland decided to remain outside of the planned Confederation. In 1867, representatives of the other colonies travelled to Britain to finalize the union, which was granted by the ''[[British North America Act, 1867|British North America Act]]'' (BNA Act) on July 1, 1867.<ref>{{cite book |first=W.

Though it is still considered that Canada became a \"kingdom in her own right\" in 1867, it was felt by the [[Colonial Office]] in London that a name such as Kingdom of Canada was too \"premature\" and \"pretentious.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=John |last=Farthing |first2=Judith |last2=Robinson |title=Freedom Wears a Crown |publisher=Kingswood House |location=Toronto |date=1957}}</ref> Instead the term \"[[Canada's Name#Adoption of Dominion|Dominion]]\" was adopted. In 1879, July 1 was formally established as ''[[Dominion Day]]'' to celebrate Confederation. While the BNA Act gave Canada a high degree of autonomy within the [[British Empire]], this autonomy extended only to internal affairs. External affairs, such as border negotiations with the United States, were still controlled from Britain.\n\n==Social and political tensions==\nCanada's material condition was weak, 1867\u20131896, and the psychological mood became increasingly embittered. Historian Arthur Lower concludes that in the late 1880s, \u201cnever before or since has Canada reached such a low state; never has there been so little evidence among its people of national spirit.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |first=Arthur R.M. |last=Lower |author-link=Arthur R.

Canada industrialized very slowly, and therefore generated few high-paying jobs. The hard-scrabble farms were hard-pressed to compete with American agriculture. Immigrants were bypassing Canada for the fast-growing United States, where high wages and new jobs and fresh lands were awaiting the ambitious. Many Canadians themselves emigrated to the States. Anglophones went to New York, Michigan and Minnesota. Quebeckers move south into the textile mills of New England.<ref>{{cite book |first=Gerard J. |last=Brault |title=The French-Canadian Heritage in New England |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gXbC2EFS08gC&pg=PA51 |year=1986 |publisher=University Press of New England |page=51 |isbn=978-0-8745-1359-2}}</ref> A half-million people left the Maritimes, and few newcomers arrived.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Patricia A. |last=Thornton |title=The Problem of Out-Migration from Atlantic Canada, 1871-1921: A New Look |journal=[[Acadiensis]] |date=Autumn 1985 |volume=XV |issue=1 |pp=3\u201334 |issn=0044-5851 |url=http://journals.hil.unb.ca/index.php/Acadiensis/article/viewPDFInterstitial/12079/12923 |jstor=30302704}}</ref> The Fathers of Confederation had envisioned fast economic growth through building a transcontinental railroad network. But it was not finished until the late 1880s, and it seemed to produce more frustration and dismay than prosperity.<ref>{{harvp|Lower|1977|pp=380-81, 395-96}}</ref> In Manitoba, for example, local businessmen and speculators were outraged when the Canadian Pacific Railway suddenly shifted its operations away from the center of the province, to the southern edge, and its lawyers and politicians blocked the opening of rival lines. Canadians distrusted their politicians, and repeatedly sought out and discovered corrupt deals, especially financial contracts made by and for the benefit of politicians. There was a widespread sense that Confederation had been a failure. Provincial politicians sought to weaken the powers of the central government, and there were few local voices speaking in support of it.<ref>{{harvp|Lower|1977|pp=381-85, 395-96}}</ref>\n \nReligious, language and ethnic differences worsened decade by decade. European Canadians were highly religious, but the Protestants and Catholics hated each other. The Francophones saw their traditional culture under siege by the Anglophones, who controlled business and finance across Canada, including Qu\u00e9bec's, and systematically blocked the expansion of French language schools outside Qu\u00e9bec. The hanging of Louis Riel for treason in 1885 convinced Francophones they were under attack, and permanently undermined the Conservative base in Qu\u00e9bec. French nationalism emerged as a powerful force that is still a dominant factor in Qu\u00e9bec's history. Inside the Irish community, the longstanding bitterness between the [[Orange Order in Canada|Protestant Orange]] and the Catholic green continued unabated. The Orange boasted of the supremacy of their Anglo-Saxon civilization and Protestant culture over the backward, medieval, priest-ridden Catholicism. They ridiculed the French and Irish races as backward and ultimately doomed.{{efn|\"Race\u201d was a synonym for what the 21st century calls an [[ethnic group]].<ref>{{cite book |first=J.R. |last=Miller |title=Equal Rights: The Jesuits' Estates Act Controversy |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |date=1979 |pp=27\u201334 |isbn=978-0-7735-0302-1}}</ref>}}<ref>{{cite book |first=P.

Intermarriage was rare and indeed friendships and casual communication were not sought after. The Catholic Irish, however, joined with Protestants to block the expansion of French schools outside Qu\u00e9bec, thereby causing severe tensions inside the Catholic community. Anglophones generally trusted Britain and the British Empire, but London had different ideas. London pushed for Confederation after the American Civil War so as to avoid the enormous expense of defending Canada against a possible American invasion. In the [[Alaska Boundary Dispute]] it demonstrated that the goodwill of the United States outweighed Canadian interests. Many businessmen, on the other hand, wanted to join the United States, leading to political tension in the upper-class clubs and boardrooms.<ref>{{cite book |first=Donald Frederick |last=Warner |title=The Idea of Continental Union: Agitation for the Annexation of Canada to the United States, 1849-1893 |publisher=Mississippi Valley Historical Association |date=1960}}</ref> \n\nFinally after 1896, with the opening of the rich Western wheat plans, did the Canadian economy recover. Immigration surged, and a spirit of optimism returned to Canada.<ref>{{harvp|Lower|1977|pp=403-413}}</ref>\n\n==First Nations==\nThe new country was led by Prime Minister John A. Macdonald. As part of Confederation, Canada was now responsible for existing treaty obligations with First Nations. Under Macdonald, Canada bought [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[North-Western Territory]] from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1869. This was unceded First Nations territory and the new government continued the British policy of acquiring land through treaty negotiations with several First Nations to enable European settlement. The exception was the existing colony of [[British Columbia]], which did not enter into treaties with the Coastal First Nations.\n\nThere were no full-scale Indian wars such as those fought in the United States as Canada expanded into First Nations territory in the Prairies.<ref>{{cite book |first=Bruce |last=Vandervort |title=Indian Wars of Canada, Mexico and the United States, 1812-1900 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H-SAAgAAQBAJ&pg=PR12 |year=2007 |publisher=Routledge |page=xii}}</ref> However, the expansion was not fully peaceful. A [[Metis (people)|M\u00e9tis]] uprising led to the formation of Manitoba in 1870. The M\u00e9tis and some First Nations allies launched a small-scale rebellion in 1885 that was put down militarily. Smaller-scale skirmishes occurred between whites and native peoples. \n\nThe period after Confederation was a period of hardship for many Prairie First Nations. The 1870s saw the disappearance of the herds of wild [[bison]] on the prairie, (partly due to illnesses passed from domesticated cattle). Many natives were affected by famine and disease introduced by Europeans and sought food and medical support when signing treaties with Canada. Aid to the natives was a political issue and federal allocations for the Department of Indian Affairs to provide medical support and food destined for famine relief were reduced by Macdonald's government.<ref name=\"daschuk\">{{cite web |url=http://activehistory.ca/2013/12/an-unsettling-prairie-history-a-review-of-james-daschuks-clearing-the-plains/ |title=An Unsettling Prairie History: A Review of James Daschuk\u2019s Clearing the Plains |first=Kevin |last=Plummer |date=December 5, 2013 |accessdate=February 3, 2020}}</ref> The period saw epidemics of [[smallpox]] and [[tuberculosis]] among the Plains First Nations.

Canada continued the pre-Confederation policy of 'civilizing' the First Nations people through \"enfranchisement.\" To become full British subjects, natives had to give up their Indian status. Canada banned some First Nations customs, for example, the [[Potlatch ban]]. The Canadian government introduced [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential schools]], where First Nation children were taught to forget their traditions. The policies would continue well into the 20th century. The [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada]] would later term the school system to be a case of cultural genocide.<ref name=\"TRCExec\">{{cite web |title=Honouring the Truth, Reconciling for the Future: Summary of the Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada |url=http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/File/2015/Findings/Exec_Summary_2015_05_31_web_o.pdf |website=National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation |publisher=Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada |accessdate=June 28, 2016 |date=May 31, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706170855/http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/File/2015/Findings/Exec_Summary_2015_05_31_web_o.pdf |archivedate=July 6, 2016  }}</ref>\n\n=== The Red River Rebellion ===\n{{Main|Red River Rebellion}}\n[[File:ProvisionalMetisGovernment.jpg|thumb|200px|The M\u00e9tis Red River Provisional Government]]\nThe new government of the confederated Canada encouraged westward settlement in the prairies. However, the people who already lived there, natives and M\u00e9tis, descendants of the children of natives and French Canadian fur traders, were opposed to waves of English-speaking settlers buying their lands. The M\u00e9tis of the Red River settlement (near present-day [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]]), led by [[Louis Riel]], formed a provisional government to negotiate with the Canadian government, although these negotiations quickly fell apart. Riel led the [[Red River Rebellion]] in 1869 and 1870, during which he executed an uppity [[Orange Order of Canada|Orange Protestant Irishman]], causing an uproar among Protestant English Canadians. Macdonald sent the militia to put down the rebellion, which they quickly did, and Riel fled to the United States. Many of the M\u00e9tis moved west into unsettled areas of Saskatchewan.\n\nThe Rebellion led to the creation of the province of [[Manitoba]] in 1870, with laws intended to protect the rights of the natives, M\u00e9tis, French-speakers and English-speakers, Catholics and Protestants.<ref>{{cite book |first=W.L. |last=Morton |title=Manitoba: a History |publisher=University of Toronto Press |date=1967}}</ref>\n\n=== The North-West Rebellion of 1885===\n{{Main|North-West Rebellion}}\n[[File:MetisPrisoners.jpg|thumb|right|250px|M\u00e9tis and First Nation prisoners following the rebellion, August 1885.]]\nAfter the Red River Rebellion, many M\u00e9tis moved west to what is now [[Saskatchewan]]. However, with the relentless westward expansion of the railway and the steady flow of settlers, they feared their way of life was threatened. In 1884 Riel was called upon by the M\u00e9tis leadership, now based in Saskatchewan, to articulate M\u00e9tis grievances to the Canadian government. Unexpectedly, he went beyond petitions and organized a military force that escalated into a small war, the [[North-West Rebellion]] of 1885. Riel was deserted by Catholic missionaries distressed by his heresies, and by all his former white allies. He was supported by the First Nations Cree and Assiniboine of Saskatchewan who joined the rebellion. Ottawa used the new rail lines to send in thousands of combat soldiers as well as Mounties and militia. They decisively defeated the rebel forces at their capital at [[Batoche, Saskatchewan|Batoche]]. Some rebels escaped to the U.S. Riel was captured and convicted of [[Treason Act 1351|high treason]]. Rejecting many protests and popular appeals, especially from Quebec, Prime Minister Macdonald decided to hang him. The M\u00e9tis submitted sullenly; there was no further Indian war.<ref>{{harvp|Gwyn|2012|pp=434\u2013493}}</ref>\n\nRiel was idealized as a heroic victim by [[Francophones]]; his execution had a lasting negative impact on Canada, polarizing the new nation along ethnic and religious lines. Riel's historical reputation has long been polarized between portrayals as a dangerous half-insane religious fanatic and rebel against the Canadian nation or by contrast a heroic rebel who fought to protect his Francophone people from the unfair encroachments of an Anglophone national government. He is increasingly celebrated as a proponent of multiculturalism, although that downplays his primary commitment to M\u00e9tis nationalism and political independence.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first=George F.

British Columbia had been important for British control of the Pacific Ocean and was a centre of the fur trade between Britain, the United States, Russia, Spain, and China. It did not participate in the original Confederation conferences but agreed to join Canada in 1871 when Macdonald promised to build a [[transcontinental railroad]] to it. The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] and the [[Dominion Land Survey]] were started soon after. \n[[File:Canada provinces 1881-1886.png|thumb|200px|left|Canadian provinces, 1881-1886]]\nIn 1873, Prince Edward Island finally accepted the inducements on offer to pay its railway debts and buy-out of the last of the colony's absentee landlords.

First, it wanted to knit the far-flung provinces together, and second, it wanted to maximize trade inside Canada and minimize trade with the United States, to avoid becoming an economic satellite. The [[Intercolonial Railway]] built 1872 - 1876, linked the Maritimes to Quebec and Ontario and contributed to an ice-free winter route to Britain. Diplomatically, it avoided the necessity of getting Washington's permission in wartime to ship munitions across the American state of Maine.  In a larger perspective, it provided the model for a government-owned and operated railway system.<ref>Ken Cruikshank, \"The People's Railway: The Intercolonial Railway and the Canadian Public Enterprise Experience.\" ''Acadiensis'' 16#1 (1986): 78\u2013100.</ref>\n\nNo less than three transcontinental lines were built to the west coast, but that was far more than the traffic would bear, making the system simply too expensive.  The priority, however, was national unity more than the national budget.<ref>Den Otter, Andy Albert, ''The Philosophy of Railways: The Transcontinental Railway Idea in British North America'' (U of Toronto Press, 1997.</ref>\n\nOne after another, the federal government was forced to take over the lines and cover their deficits. Since most of the equipment was imported from Britain or the United States, and most of the products carried were from farms, mines or forests, there was little stimulation to manufacturing. On the other hand, the railways were essential to the growth of the wheat regions in the Prairies, and to the expansion of coal mining, lumbering, and paper-making. Improvements to the St. Lawrence waterway system continued apace, and many short lines were built to river ports.<ref>J.A. Eagle, ''The Canadian Pacific and the Development of Western Canada'' (Kingston, 1989).</ref>\n\nBy 1875, the government was spending a fourth of its budget on building the {{convert|4000|km|mile}}-long Canadian Pacific, as well as finishing the Intercolonial. Arrangements with the Canadian Pacific Railway syndicate in 1880 brought on board the leading bankers and financiers in Canada as well as American and European bankers. Incredible geographical obstacles \u2013 rivers, swamps, mountains, and severe weather were major impediments, but the line opened from Montreal to Vancouver in late 1885.<ref>{{cite book |first=Harold Adams |last=Innis |title=A History of the Canadian Pacific Railway |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.173579 |publisher=P.

The railway also opened coal and lead mines, fixed establishments press service, and open telegraph lines. It created tourist hotels in the mountains, most famously at [[Banff, Alberta]] and nearby [[Chateau Lake Louise]], as well as landmark stations in major cities. The CPR built a fleet to enable fast passenger and freight service between Europe and Asia via Canada. Connections to American railways proved valuable. As the American frontier was largely closed by 1890, migrants looking to settle virgin land moved from the United States into the Prairie provinces. They shipped their wheat out by rail, and ordered supplies from Ontario.<ref>{{cite book |first=James Blaine |last=Hedges |title=Building the Canadian West: The Land and Colonization Policies of the Canadian Pacific Railway |url=https://archive.org/details/buildingthecanad009200mbp |date=1939}}</ref>\n\nA scandal erupted in 1873. Macdonald and the Conservative government faced a major political crisis when it was revealed that the Canadian Pacific Railway Company had helped fund Macdonald's [[1872 Canadian federal election|election campaign in 1872]]. A [[1874 Canadian federal election|new election was called in 1874]], and [[Alexander Mackenzie (politician)|Alexander Mackenzie]] became prime minister. The public's suspicion of Macdonald was overcome by 1878 when Macdonald and the Conservatives were re-elected.\n\n=== Macdonald's \"National Policy\" ===\n{{Main|National Policy}}\nAfter being restored as Prime Minister, Macdonald introduced the [[National Policy]], a system of protective tariffs meant to strengthen the Canadian economy. Part of the policy was the completion of the railroad, which would allow products to be transferred more easily across the country. It was also a response to the United States, which had a much stronger economy that threatened to overwhelm Canada; the United States had a trade reciprocity treaty with the United Province of Canada from 1854 to 1866 but abrogated the treaty before Confederation. Many people believed this policy was only beneficial to Ontario, as the Maritimes especially depended on trade with the United States. While it was somewhat beneficial for asserting Canadian independence, it was not very useful in the less industrial Maritimes and West.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Vernon C. |last=Fowke |title=National Policy and Western Development in North America |journal=Journal of Economic History |date=December 1956 |volume=16 |issue=4 |pp=461\u2013479 |jstor=2114691}}</ref>\n\n=== Ontario's quest for provincial rights ===\nWhile Macdonald may have hoped that the BNA Act would provide the central government in Ottawa with a strong hand, some of the provinces, particularly Ontario under the leadership of its premier [[Oliver Mowat]], pushed for interpretations of the constitution that favoured provincial rather than Dominion interests.

The boundary between Ontario and Manitoba became a hotly contested matter, with the federal government attempting to extend Manitoba's jurisdiction eastward to the Great Lakes, into the areas that Ontario claimed. In 1882 Premier Mowat threatened to pull Ontario from Confederation over the issue. Mowat sent police into the disputed territory to assert Ontario's claims, while Manitoba (at the behest of the national government) did the same.<ref>{{harvp|Ibbitson|2001|p=46}}</ref> The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in Britain, serving as Canada's highest appeal court, repeatedly issued rulings taking the side of provincial rights. These decisions would to some extent neutralize the power of the central government, creating a more decentralized federation. John Ibbitson writes that by 1914:\n{{quote|text=Confederation had evolved into a creation beyond John A. Macdonald's worst nightmare. Powerful, independent provinces, sovereign within their own spheres, manipulated the rights of property, levied their own taxes\u2014even income taxes, in a few cases\u2014exploited their natural resources, and managed schools, hospitals, and relief for the poor, while a weak and ineffectual central government presided over not much of anything in the drab little capital on the banks of the Ottawa.<ref>{{harvp|Ibbitson|2001|p=49}}</ref>}}\n\n=== The Manitoba Schools Question ===\n{{Main|Manitoba Schools Question}}\nAfter the Red River Rebellion and the entrance of Manitoba into Confederation, settlers from English Canada arrived in the new province in greater numbers. In 1890, the provincial government passed the ''Manitoba Schools Act'', abolishing government funding for Catholic schools and abolishing French as an official language - contrary to the ''[[Manitoba Act]]'' that created the province. This led to another federal political crisis, and by 1896, Prime Minister [[Mackenzie Bowell]] was forced to resign. [[Wilfrid Laurier]], a Catholic from Quebec, became prime minister. Laurier developed a compromise stating that French would be used in schools when there were a significant number of French-speaking students; this compromise was denounced by both sides but was recognized as the only possible solution. However, along with the execution of Louis Riel, the Manitoba Schools Question led to an increase of French Canadian nationalism.<ref>{{cite book |editor-first=Lovell |editor-last=Clark |title=The Manitoba School Question: majority rule or minority rights? |publisher=Copp Clark |date=1968}} historians debate the issue</ref>\n\n== Immigration to the West ==\n[[File:Ad to attract Immigrants to wheat belt in 1898.jpg|thumb|390px|Canada sought immigrants from Europe, especially farmers; cartoon by [[John Wilson Bengough]] from Toronto ''Globe'' May 19, 1898]]\n{{further|Last Best West}}\nWhile the National Policy, CPR and ''[[Dominion Lands Act]]'' had been in place for several decades, mass immigration to Canada's prairie regions only got underway around 1896. Why it began then is a matter of debate among historians. John Dales argued that it was a combination of rising wheat prices, cheaper ocean transport costs, technological change, new varieties of wheat, and the scarcity of land in the United States. Norry does not view any of these developments as being important and instead argues that new methods of [[dry farming]] lead to the breakthrough. Recently, Ward had argued that technological change was the most important factor, with a number of different inventions becoming cheap and reliable enough to be widely used around this period. The period of western settlement was one of the most prosperous in Canadian history. From 1896 to 1911, Canada had the world's fastest-growing economy. Immigration from Eastern Europe and the eastern parts of the former Austro-Hungarian empire brought many old-world farmers to settle the west and despite their lack of knowledge of the English language, many adapted quickly to the farming environment which was somewhat similar to their original homelands.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Klondike Gold Rush===\n{{Main|Klondike Gold Rush}}\n\n[[File:Klondike camp Yukon head.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Miner's camp at the head of the Yukon River]]\nIn August 1896, a party led by [[Skookum Jim Mason]] discovered gold on a tributary of the [[Klondike River]]. After the discovery was publicized in 1897, an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 people braved numerous hardships to reach the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]] goldfields in the winter and spring of 1897\u201398. With the influx of American stampeders, the government decided to relieve the [[Northwest Territories|North-West Territories]]' administration from the task of controlling the sudden boom of population, economic activity and influx of non-Canadians. On June 13, 1898, the [[Yukon]] became a separate territory. In 1901, after many had gone back, the [[Census in Canada|Census]] put the population of the territory at 27,219, a figure that was not reached again until 1991. The influx of people greatly stimulated mineral exploration in other parts of the Yukon and led to two subsidiary gold rushes in [[Atlin, British Columbia]] and [[Nome, Alaska]] as well as a number of mini-rushes. Transportation needs to the goldfields led to the construction of the [[White Pass and Yukon Route]].\n\n=== Alaska Boundary Dispute ===\n{{main|Alaska Boundary Dispute}}\nThe precise Alaska-Canada boundary became important when gold was discovered in the Klondike. Miners had to enter through American Alaska to get there. Canada wanted its own Pacific port and rejected American offers to lease it one. Instead, it claimed its historic boundary with Russian Alaska included the [[Lynn Canal]] and the port of [[Skagway]], both occupied by the U.S. The dispute went to arbitration in 1903 but, to the anger of Canadians, the British delegate sided with the Americans. It was a matter of ensuring good relations between London and Washington, at the expense of Canada. The resentment contributed to the defeat of [[Wilfrid Laurier]] and his Liberal Party in the 1911 election as they proposed a reciprocal trade treaty with the U.S. that would lower tariff barriers.<ref>{{cite book |editor-first=John A. |editor-last=Munro |title=The Alaska Boundary Dispute |publisher=Copp Clark |date=1970}} provides primary and secondary sources.</ref>\n\n=== Rising Anti-Asian sentiment in British Columbia ===\n[[File:Demand-oriental-exclusion-1907-Vancouver.jpg|thumb|370px|Exclusionist cartoon in ''Saturday Sunset'' magazine, (Vancouver, August 24, 1907.)

Then came the introduction of the first [[Head tax (Canada)|Chinese Head Tax]] legislation passed in 1885, which was in response to a growing number of [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] working on the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. Subsequent increases in the head tax in 1900 and 1903 limited Chinese entrants to Canada. [[Anti-Oriental Riots (Vancouver)|In 1907 a major riot against Asians from India, Japan and China took place in Vancouver, BC.]] In 1923 the government passed the ''Chinese Immigration Act'' which excluded Chinese from entering Canada altogether between 1923 and 1947.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Howard H. |last=Sugimoto |title=The Vancouver Riot and Its International Significance |journal=Pacific Northwest Quarterly |date=October 1973 |volume=64 |issue=4 |pp=163\u2013174 |jstor=40489721}}</ref>\n\nCanadians in British Columbia grew increasingly fearful and angry about immigration from Asia that they perceived threatened their jobs and the British culture and standard of living in B.C.

Serious anti-Asian riots erupted in Vancouver in 1887 and 1907. In the 1907 riot a mob of English-Canadian rioters attacked Chinese- and Japanese-Canadian businesses but met stiff resistance from the Japanese community. By 1923 the dominion government passed the ''[[Chinese Immigration Act]]'', which prohibited all Chinese immigration until it was repealed in 1947. [[Sikh]]s had to face an amended ''Immigration Act'' in 1908 that required Sikhs to have $200 on arrival in Canada, and immigration would be allowed only if the passenger had arrived by continuous journey from India, which was impossible. In 1914 the ''[[Komagata Maru incident|Komagata Maru]]'' arrived in Vancouver with 376 Sikhs aboard, but only 24 were admitted. The Japanese in 1942 were rounded up and sent to inland camps for the duration of the war. Asian-Canadians were finally given equal status and the vote in 1947. For discriminating against Chinese immigrants in past periods, an official government apology and compensations were announced on June 22, 2006.\n<ref>{{harvp|Barman|2007|pp=156-157}}</ref>\n\n==Popular culture==\nCanadians in the 19th century came to believe themselves possessed of a unique \"northern character,\" due to the long, harsh winters that only those of hardy body and mind could survive.

Along with some Americans, he also hoped for a shift of focus towards North America, a policy often known as \"continentalism.\" However, in 1899, the British immediately assumed Canada would send military support to the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] in South Africa, and there was indeed enormous support for military action from English Canada. French Canada was strongly opposed to military support for Britain's imperialist wars. The opposition was led by [[Henri Bourassa]], who, like Laurier, preferred a united, independent Canada. Bourassa denounced Laurier when Laurier eventually decided to allow a volunteer force to fight in the war, even though the other option would have been calling up an official army.\n\nAs Prime Minister, [[Wilfrid Laurier|Laurier]] successfully brought [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Alberta]] into Confederation in 1905, carving those provinces out of the Northwest Territories. He felt Canada was on the verge of becoming a world power and declared that the 20th century would \"belong to Canada\". However, he faced even more criticism when he introduced the ''[[Naval Service Act]]'' in 1910. It was meant to make Canada less dependent on Britain and British imperialism, but Bourassa believed the British would now call on the Canadian navy whenever it was needed, just as they did with the Canadian army. Pro-British imperialists were also opposed to the attempt to remove Canada from the Empire. The Naval Service Bill led to Laurier's downfall in the [[1911 Canadian federal election|election of 1911]]. Conservatives led by [[Robert Laird Borden]] attacked reciprocity with the United States, warning that strong economic links would weaken the Empire and allow the neighbour to increasingly take over the economy.\n\nBritish politicians at the time and historians ever since have explored whether the British Empire was too expensive for the British budget. [[Joseph Chamberlain]] thought so but he had little success at the Imperial Conference of 1902 asking overseas partners to increase their contribution. Canada and Australia spoke of funding a warship\u2014the Canadian Senate voted it down in 1913.<ref>{{cite book|author=Martin Thornton|title=Churchill, Borden and Anglo-Canadian Naval Relations, 1911\u201314|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-RZEAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT82|year=2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|pages=82\u201385}}</ref> Meanwhile, the Royal Navy adjusted its war plans to focus on Germany, economizing on defending against lesser threats in peripheral areas such as the Pacific and Indian Oceans.

The series depicts the lives of two neighbouring families in a village, and the struggle of a group of four friends living in the city, trying to pursue a music career. In the village, it focuses on two close neighbours, Rashida ([[Bushra Ansari]]) and Sajida ([[Samiya Mumtaz]]). Rashida (nicknamed as Sheedaan) along with her husband Maajid ([[Rehan Sheikh]]), daughter Meera ([[Urwa Hocane]]) and son Ejaz are local musicians who earn through singing and entertaining people at weddings, because of which they are discriminated and criticised in the society, being termed as ''Marasi''. Whereas  Sajida, Parvez's widow, works as a maid in a distant house. She runs the household, cares for herself and her 10-year-old daughter, named Zebo. Simultaneously, in urban city ''Lahore'', resides a group of four students, Maleeha, Haris, Arsh and Farwa who want to pursue a music carrier. Meera is in a complicated relationship with Illyas who happens to be Sajida's nephew. He always warned her to stop singing or he will break his relationship.

Explaining what prompted the decision to create the drama on such a complex subject, Roshaneh Zafar from Kashf Foundation pointed to the Kasur incident as the catalyst which pushed both Kashf Foundation and MD Productions towards bringing the issue onto mainstream television.

Bushra Ansari shared her role which is that of a woman who is extremely confident but unrefined, and embodies the real culture of Pakistan's rural areas. She regaled the media present with her quick vivid descriptions and stories painted about the time on set in Mirpur Khas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Meet and Greet the cast of Udaari|date=8 April 2016|publisher=TrendinginSocial|accessdate=30 June 2016|url=http://www.trendinginsocial.com/meet-greet-cast-udaari/}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Udaari OST\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Farhan Saeed]], [[Hadiqa Kiani]], [[Bushra Ansari]] and [[Maryam Fatima]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = {{Start date|df=yes|2016|04|12}}\n| recorded   = 2016\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Television soundtrack]]\n| length     =\n| language   = [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]]\n| label      = [[Momina Duraid Productions|M.D Productions]] and Kashf Foundation\n| producer   = [[Momina Duraid]]\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\nThe [[title song]] of Udaari was composed by musician [[Sahir Ali Bagga]] and Sohail Haider, the lyrics were penned down by Imran Raza.

Momina Duraid from MD productions shared that some of the actors had to really come out of their comfort zones for the roles that they played in the drama.

Wajih ([[Bilal Abbas|Bilal Abbas Khan]]), Yawer ([[Aijaz Aslam]]), Shayaan ([[Emmad Irfani]]), and Haya are siblings. Mannat is married to Shayaan.  Her [[In-Laws]] are shown as quite wealthy. However, Nayab is poor. Her mother died and she lives with her father Ramzaan (Noor-ul-Hassan), greedy step-mother (Saima Qureshi) and her 2 step-sisters. Nayab gets murdered after a rape attempt and physical violence on the night of her friend Haya's engagement. Nayab is rushed to the hospital where she soon dies. As Nayab breathes her last, she indicates in her testimony before Mannat & the police the identity of her assailant by calling him 'Raja' (a nickname which the women in the family jokingly use for Wajih). Mannat - after hearing this, files an F.I.R. [[First information report|F.I.R]] against him which creates havoc in Mannat's relationship with her In-Laws. As the story unfolds, the viewers are made to see straight through Mannat's in-laws' so-called perfect aristocratic facade and how each member of the family is either directly part of  or indirectly aiding & abetting in eliminating Nayab. Mannat's husband is really supportive of his wife because he has studied in America and is beginning to doubt his brother based on all that he hears regarding this case. He is on the path of the righteousness and truth. In addition to the main plot, there are several sub-plots in which we are made to see that all the main characters involved in the death of Nayab (Yawer, Wajih, Haya and even Shahwar) have their own dark side and that they seem to have skeletons in their closet (they are hiding something) which makes the main story line all the more sensational & interesting. The story meanders through a series of interesting twists & turns, with police, lawyers, courts and even street goons participating in an effort to shield & cover-up the real culprit and drag Mannat away from getting her hands round Wajih's throat, until - as fate would have it, the truth is as plain as a nose on our face.  Finally the curtain falls with the culprit getting his comeuppance and justice being served.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arynews.tv/en/secret-out-cheekh-nayab/|title=So the audiences finally know who killed Nayab in Cheekh!|date=2019-02-11|website=ARYNEWS|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-11}}</ref> <!--(Edited: [[Masood Khan Editor]])-->\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Saba Qamar]] as Mannat Shayan: Shayan's wife; Wajih, Yawer, and Haya's sister-in-law; Nayab's friend.<ref name=Nation/>\n*[[Bilal Abbas|Bilal Abbas Khan]] as Wajih Taseer: Haya, Yawer, and Shayan's younger brother; Mannat's brother-in-law.<ref name=TNS/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mangobaaz.com/people-think-bilal-abbas-khan-is-the-psycho-murderer-in-cheekh-but-is-there-enough-proof|title=People Think Bilal Abbas Khan Is The Psycho Villain In \"Cheekh\" But Is There Enough Proof?|last=Zia|first=Iman|date=2019-02-08|website=[[MangoBaaz]]|access-date=2019-02-20}}</ref>\n*[[Aijaz Aslam]] as Yawer Taseer: Haya, Shayan, and Wajih's elder brother; Shewar's husband.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hipinpakistan.com/news/1155826|title=Exclusive: Aijaz Aslam to play a pivotal role in Saba Qamar, Bilal Abbas starrer Cheekh!|last=Desk|first=H.

Wajih ([[Bilal Abbas|Bilal Abbas Khan]]), Yawer ([[Aijaz Aslam]]), Shayaan ([[Emmad Irfani]]), and Haya are siblings. Mannat is married to Shayaan.  Her [[In-Laws]] are shown as quite wealthy. However, Nayab is poor. Her mother died and she lives with her father Ramzaan ([[Noor-ul-Hassan]]), greedy step-mother (Saima Qureshi) and her 2 step-sisters. Nayab gets murdered after a rape attempt and physical violence on the night of her friend Haya's engagement. Nayab is rushed to the hospital where she soon dies. As Nayab breathes her last, she indicates in her testimony before Mannat & the police the identity of her assailant by calling him 'Raja' (a nickname which the women in the family jokingly use for Wajih). Mannat - after hearing this, files an F.I.R. [[First information report|F.I.R]] against him which creates havoc in Mannat's relationship with her In-Laws. As the story unfolds, the viewers are made to see straight through Mannat's in-laws' so-called perfect aristocratic facade and how each member of the family is either directly part of  or indirectly aiding & abetting in eliminating Nayab. Mannat's husband is really supportive of his wife because he has studied in America and is beginning to doubt his brother based on all that he hears regarding this case. He is on the path of the righteousness and truth. In addition to the main plot, there are several sub-plots in which we are made to see that all the main characters involved in the death of Nayab (Yawer, Wajih, Haya and even Shahwar) have their own dark side and that they seem to have skeletons in their closet (they are hiding something) which makes the main story line all the more sensational & interesting. The story meanders through a series of interesting twists & turns, with police, lawyers, courts and even street goons participating in an effort to shield & cover-up the real culprit and drag Mannat away from getting her hands round Wajih's throat, until - as fate would have it, the truth is as plain as a nose on our face.  Finally the curtain falls with the culprit getting his comeuppance and justice being served.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arynews.tv/en/secret-out-cheekh-nayab/|title=So the audiences finally know who killed Nayab in Cheekh!|date=2019-02-11|website=ARYNEWS|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-11}}</ref> <!--(Edited: [[Masood Khan Editor]])-->\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Saba Qamar]] as Mannat Shayan: Shayan's wife; Wajih, Yawer, and Haya's sister-in-law; Nayab's friend.<ref name=Nation/>\n*[[Bilal Abbas|Bilal Abbas Khan]] as Wajih Taseer: Haya, Yawer, and Shayan's younger brother; Mannat's brother-in-law.<ref name=TNS/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mangobaaz.com/people-think-bilal-abbas-khan-is-the-psycho-murderer-in-cheekh-but-is-there-enough-proof|title=People Think Bilal Abbas Khan Is The Psycho Villain In \"Cheekh\" But Is There Enough Proof?|last=Zia|first=Iman|date=2019-02-08|website=[[MangoBaaz]]|access-date=2019-02-20}}</ref>\n*[[Aijaz Aslam]] as Yawer Taseer: Haya, Shayan, and Wajih's elder brother; Shewar's husband.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hipinpakistan.com/news/1155826|title=Exclusive: Aijaz Aslam to play a pivotal role in Saba Qamar, Bilal Abbas starrer Cheekh!|last=Desk|first=H.

Hadi is a successful and famous gynecologist. She thinks that he is coming back for her but actually Hadi is coming back for Uroosa ([[Naveen Waqar]]) who he loves. Haya has been raised by her Taya and Tayee (Hadi's parents) because her mother died when she was young and her father couldn't look after her. She has two other sisters Uroosa and Lubna who were raised by their khala. When Haadi announces his desire to marry Uroosa, Haya is left in shock and anger. She does all she can to ruin their wedding with the help of her childhood friend Fariha ([[Sarah Khan]]) who is Hadi and her cousin, as well. Nevertheless, the wedding takes place and on Uroosa and Hadi's wedding night, Haya blurts out about her feelings to Uroosa. Uroosa is shocked and so is Hadi. The next day Haya decides to leave the house and she takes refuge with her friend Kaukab. Her friend's husband has bad intentions and Haya also slaps him. Haya leaves Kaukab's house and she starts living in a hostel. Here, she works as a teacher. She meets her colleague Rameez ([[Zahid Ahmed (actor)|Zahid Ahmed]]). While Haya had left the house, Uroosa and Hadi go for their honeymoon and after returning, they find out that Uroosa is pregnant. Both are very happy at the thought of becoming parents. When Haya finds out about this, she gets even more depressed. However, Uroosa is suffering from pre-eclampsia and Hadi operates Uroosa but she dies during childbirth. Hadi starts blaming himself for his wife's death.\n\n===Part 2===\nHadi holds himself responsible for Uroosa's death as he was the one operating on her. Fareesa is given the job of looking after the baby. Meanwhile, Haya gets friendly with Rameez and the two start hanging out together. When Fareesa realizes how rich Hadi is she tries to woo him and ditches her boyfriend Saim. She talks to Haya and tells her never to come back while Haya is also unaware of Uroosa's death. Meanwhile, Fareesa is living in Hadi's house and creates misunderstandings within the family. She tells Hadi that his mom wants them married and she tells Hadi's mom that Hadi is interested in her. Hadi's mom forces Hadi to marry Fareesa against his will. Meanwhile, Haya returns on their wedding day as she has found about Uroosa's death from her friend Kaukab who meets her to apologize and tells her that her husband, Faiz ([[Danish Nawaz]]) died. She is stunned to see Hadi married to Fareesa. Fareesa is really happy as she has finally got the life she dreamed for. She wants to get rid of Haya as she believes that Hadi will fall in love with Haya. Haya agrees to leave. Haya goes to live with her father. When Fareesa finds out that Haya and Hadi spent a night together talking and having fun, she blames Hadi for deceiving her. Hadi in a fit of rage slaps Fareesa. Haya is really depressed as Fareesa came to her house and said that she will never let Haya steal her husband. When Hadi finds out about Haya's friendship with Rameez, he is jealous and tells her to never talk to Rameez again. Haya and Rameez become good friends and Rameez even proposes to Haya. Haya accepts the proposal. On the other hand, Hadi is getting jealous of Rameez. Saim who was rejected by Fareesa has come back from America. Now he has a job in America and is quite rich. He and Fareesa accidentally meet in the mall and their friendship rekindles.\nRameez goes to Haya's house to talk about his and Haya's marriage. Haya's father and Haya's Taya (Hadi's father) asks him various questions and at last he decides that Rameez is the man for Haya. Hadi constantly tries to persuade Haya not to marry Rameez, as he thinks Rameez is not the perfect man for her. She refuses. Rameez's and Haya's marriage preparations begin.\nHaya and Hadi's friendship rekindles and they talk with each other like they were before. Haya feels like what she is doing is wrong, she should not marry Rameez. So, she starts to ignore him. Rameez scared of why Haya isn't replying to his call, sneaks into her house through the terrace. He meets Haya at last, who gets surprised and scared when she sees him. Unfortunately Hadi sees them but allows them to talk upon Rameez's request. After a while Rameez leaves. Haya constantly think of her decision of marrying Rameez. Her Tayee (Hadi's mother)  asks her that if she wants she can stop her marriage. They are not pressurizing her to marry Rameez. She says that she is happy in marrying Rameez, she is just a bit nervous.\nHaya's and Rameez's marriage take place.\n\n===Part 3===\nAfter their marriage takes place they return to Rameez's home and Rameez takes a few pictures of Haya and suddenly she faints. Rameez takes her to the hospital. He even informs Hadi. Hadi reaches the hospital immediately. Rameez asks him if he can stay with Haya for sometime in the hospital as he has to go back home. Hadi agrees. When Hadi and Haya are in the hospital's room, Rameez takes a few pictures of them through a small window of the room. Hadi tells Haya that now she is not alone, she has a husband, she should think about Rameez.\nWhen Haya and Rameez reach back home, Rameez tells her that how he had always wished for a house in which his beautiful wife and he would cook food for themselves together.\nIt is then shown that Haya is leaving for her Taya (Hadi's father) and Tai (Hadi's mother) house for some days according to a rasam. Rameez asks her to stay but she says that she would be back in some days. Then she leaves.\nAt her Tai's house Haya receives Rameez's call, who asks her to come back as he is feeling alone.when Haya refuses to do so, Rameez says that he is coming to her house right now because he is missing her a lot. She says that it's not possible as his house is far away from her house, it would take hours to reach there, and she is stunned when she turns around to see Rameez standing near the door.\nHaya comes to know that Hadi has started taking patients (which he had stopped before because of the death of his first wife Uroosa). Her Tayee in shock talks to Haya and says that I wonder how he agreed on taking cases once again. Haya says it's because of me, I asked him to do so. She says that there should be a party because it's a big news. They should celebrate. Her Tayee even tells Rameez about this, who also seems to be happy.\nOn the other hand, Fareesa goes to meet Saim, who tells her that he would be leaving for America soon as he cannot stay longer. His company has asked him to come back. Fareesa gets angry. She says to him that she cannot live without him, to which he replies by saying that he cannot too.\nAs Fareesa had gone to meet Saim and refused to prepare lunch for Hadi, which is to be sent to his hospital, Haya prepares his lunch. While Haya is preparing his lunch Rameez arrives there and asks her whether she would prepare the lunch for him in the same way, as she is preparing for Hadi. She replies \"Yes ! I would.\"\nWhen Hadi receives his lunch box at his hospital he sees that there is a note inside the lunch box as well. The note is from Haya and she has written on the note \"Just for HS.\" Hadi smiles and begins eating his lunch.\nWhen he reaches back at his home he is ecstatic to see the house's dining room decorated and everyone standing there waiting for him to cut the cake. He cuts the cake and suddenly Fareesa appears. She asks what is going on. Hadi's mother tells her that it's a celebration and also tells her the reason behind it. She says that why doesn't she ask him (Hadi) what happened that made him take this decision.\nBut Haya, interrupts her. Hadi's mom takes him to a side and tells him that Haya is not willing to go back with Rameez. She says that Hadi know better than her about Haya, and requests him to ask her to leave, it will be better for her and as well as you. Hadi leaves the party and goes to his room. Haya arrives there and asks him why he left the party and came here. He tells Haya that he is not interested in this party and she should leave him alone.

Hadi is a successful and famous gynecologist. She thinks that he is coming back for her but actually Hadi is coming back for Uroosa ([[Naveen Waqar]]) who he loves. Haya has been raised by her Taya and Tayee (Hadi's parents) because her mother died when she was young and her father couldn't look after her. She has two other sisters Uroosa and Lubna who were raised by their khala. When Haadi announces his desire to marry Uroosa, Haya is left in shock and anger. She does all she can to ruin their wedding with the help of her childhood friend Fariha ([[Sarah Khan]]) who is Hadi and her cousin, as well. Nevertheless, the wedding takes place and on Uroosa and Hadi's wedding night, Haya blurts out about her feelings to Uroosa. Uroosa is shocked and so is Hadi. The next day Haya decides to leave the house and she takes refuge with her friend Kaukab. Her friend's husband has bad intentions and Haya also slaps him. Haya leaves Kaukab's house and she starts living in a hostel. Here, she works as a teacher. She meets her colleague Rameez ([[Zahid Ahmed (actor)|Zahid Ahmed]]). While Haya had left the house, Uroosa and Hadi go for their honeymoon and after returning, they find out that Uroosa is pregnant. Both are very happy at the thought of becoming parents. When Haya finds out about this, she gets even more depressed. However, Uroosa is suffering from pre-eclampsia and Hadi operates Uroosa but she dies during childbirth. Hadi starts blaming himself for his wife's death.\n\n===Part 2===\nHadi holds himself responsible for Uroosa's death as he was the one operating on her. Fareesa is given the job of looking after the baby. Meanwhile, Haya gets friendly with Rameez and the two start hanging out together. When Fareesa realizes how rich Hadi is she tries to woo him and ditches her boyfriend Saim. She talks to Haya and tells her never to come back while Haya is also unaware of Uroosa's death. Meanwhile, Fareesa is living in Hadi's house and creates misunderstandings within the family. She tells Hadi that his mom wants them married and she tells Hadi's mom that Hadi is interested in her. Hadi's mom forces Hadi to marry Fareesa against his will. Meanwhile, Haya returns on their wedding day as she has found about Uroosa's death from her friend Kaukab who meets her to apologize and tells her that her husband, Faiz ([[Danish Nawaz]]) died. She is stunned to see Hadi married to Fareesa. Fareesa is really happy as she has finally got the life she dreamed for. She wants to get rid of Haya as she believes that Hadi will fall in love with Haya. Haya agrees to leave. Haya goes to live with her father. When Fareesa finds out that Haya and Hadi spent a night together talking and having fun, she blames Hadi for deceiving her. Hadi in a fit of rage slaps Fareesa. Haya is really depressed as Fareesa came to her house and said that she will never let Haya steal her husband. When Hadi finds out about Haya's friendship with Rameez, he is jealous and tells her to never talk to Rameez again. Haya and Rameez become good friends and Rameez even proposes to Haya. Haya accepts the proposal. On the other hand, Hadi is getting jealous of Rameez. Saim who was rejected by Fareesa has come back from America. Now he has a job in America and is quite rich. He and Fareesa accidentally meet in the mall and their friendship rekindles.\nRameez goes to Haya's house to talk about his and Haya's marriage. Haya's father and Haya's Taya (Hadi's father) asks him various questions and at last he decides that Rameez is the man for Haya. Hadi constantly tries to persuade Haya not to marry Rameez, as he thinks Rameez is not the perfect man for her. She refuses. Rameez's and Haya's marriage preparations begin.\nHaya and Hadi's friendship rekindles and they talk with each other like they were before. Haya feels like what she is doing is wrong, she should not marry Rameez. So, she starts to ignore him. Rameez scared of why Haya isn't replying to his call, sneaks into her house through the terrace. He meets Haya at last, who gets surprised and scared when she sees him. Unfortunately Hadi sees them but allows them to talk upon Rameez's request. After a while Rameez leaves. Haya constantly think of her decision of marrying Rameez. Her Tayee (Hadi's mother)  asks her that if she wants she can stop her marriage. They are not pressurizing her to marry Rameez. She says that she is happy in marrying Rameez, she is just a bit nervous.\nHaya's and Rameez's marriage take place.\n\n===Part 3===\nAfter their marriage takes place they return to Rameez's home and Rameez takes a few pictures of Haya and suddenly she faints. Rameez takes her to the hospital. He even informs Hadi. Hadi reaches the hospital immediately. Rameez asks him if he can stay with Haya for sometime in the hospital as he has to go back home. Hadi agrees. When Hadi and Haya are in the hospital's room, Rameez takes a few pictures of them through a small window of the room. Hadi tells Haya that now she is not alone, she has a husband, she should think about Rameez.\nWhen Haya and Rameez reach back home, Rameez tells her that how he had always wished for a house in which his beautiful wife and he would cook food for themselves together.\nIt is then shown that Haya is leaving for her Taya (Hadi's father) and Tai (Hadi's mother) house for some days according to a rasam. Rameez asks her to stay but she says that she would be back in some days. Then she leaves.\nAt her Tai's house Haya receives Rameez's call, who asks her to come back as he is feeling alone.when Haya refuses to do so, Rameez says that he is coming to her house right now because he is missing her a lot. She says that it's not possible as his house is far away from her house, it would take hours to reach there, and she is stunned when she turns around to see Rameez standing near the door.\nHaya comes to know that Hadi has started taking patients (which he had stopped before because of the death of his first wife Uroosa). Her Tayee in shock talks to Haya and says that I wonder how he agreed on taking cases once again. Haya says it's because of me, I asked him to do so. She says that there should be a party because it's a big news. They should celebrate. Her Tayee even tells Rameez about this, who also seems to be happy.\nOn the other hand, Fareesa goes to meet Saim, who tells her that he would be leaving for America soon as he cannot stay longer. His company has asked him to come back. Fareesa gets angry. She says to him that she cannot live without him, to which he replies by saying that he cannot too.\nAs Fareesa had gone to meet Saim and refused to prepare lunch for Hadi, which is to be sent to his hospital, Haya prepares his lunch. While Haya is preparing his lunch Rameez arrives there and asks her whether she would prepare the lunch for him in the same way, as she is preparing for Hadi. She replies \"Yes ! I would.\"\nWhen Hadi receives his lunch box at his hospital he sees that there is a note inside the lunch box as well. The note is from Haya and she has written on the note \"Just for HS.\" Hadi smiles and begins eating his lunch.\nWhen he reaches back at his home he is ecstatic to see the house's dining room decorated and everyone standing there waiting for him to cut the cake. He cuts the cake and suddenly Fareesa appears. She asks what is going on. Hadi's mother tells her that it's a celebration and also tells her the reason behind it. She says that why doesn't she ask him (Hadi) what happened that made him take this decision.\nBut Haya, interrupts her. Hadi's mom takes him to a side and tells him that Haya is not willing to go back with Rameez. She says that Hadi know better than her about Haya, and requests him to ask her to leave, it will be better for her and as well as you. Hadi leaves the party and goes to his room. Haya arrives there and asks him why he left the party and came here. He tells Haya that he is not interested in this party and she should leave him alone. He says that he is suffering from a headache and wants to rest. Haya asks him if her Tayee said something regarding her to him. He says no he just wants her to leave and live with her husband. She asks him that he is asking her to live with her husband, but before saying that he should first think about him and Fareesa and why they don't even live the same room, even when they are husband and wife. He says that it's not about him and Fareesa it's about Haya and Rameez. She says that she wants to leave Hadi and start her life with Rameez. At last he says \"Yes !\" Haya leaves his room. Feeling dejected, Haya then tells Rameez to take her back to their home. Once they reach their home, Rameez gifts her a dress and asks her to wear it. After that, he asks her if she would do everything that she does for HS. He shows her pictures that he took of her and Hadi in hospital.

He had seen her love for Hadi way before.\nHe grabs her hand and hurts her when she is sleeping for her to wake up get ready for his own entertainment.\nHe asks her to make lunch and breakfast for him. And gets excited on seeing the lunchbox (Apparently he had seen a dream about it). He tells Haya that he has finished off her balance on her phone and would take it with him. He has also disconnected landline and internet connection and anyway by which she could communicate with anyone.\nHaya gets perplexed about the happenings with her.\nWhile Hadi is trying to get back to Fareesa, Fareesa avoids him. He sees her while she's talking to Saim. But Fareesa tells him that she was talking to her mother. Haadi still feels that she's lying because she kept changing the subject. Later Hadi tracks her and sees her with saim in a public park. Hadi furiously reaches home and when \nFareesa arrives he questions her but she simply refuses to what Hadi saw.
