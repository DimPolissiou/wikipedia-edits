It is one of the [[list of largest art museums in the world|largest]] art museums in [[France]].\n\nIt was one of the first museums built in France, established under the instructions of [[Napoleon I]] at the beginning of the 19th century as part of the popularisation of art. [[Jean-Antoine Chaptal]]'s decree of 1801 selected fifteen French cities (among which Lille) to receive the works seized from churches and from the European territories occupied by the armies of Revolutionary France. The painters [[Louis Joseph Watteau]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Watteau]], known as the \"Watteau of Lille\", were heavily involved in the museum's beginnings - Louis Joseph Watteau made in 1795 the first inventory of the paintings confiscated during the Revolution, whilst his son Fran\u00e7ois was deputy curator of the museum from 1808 to 1823.\n\nThe museum opened in 1809 and was initially housed in a church confiscated from the [[R\u00e9collets]] before being transferred to the city's town hall. In 1866, the \"mus\u00e9e Wicar\", formed from the collection of [[Jean-Baptiste Wicar]], was merged into the Palais des Beaux-Arts. Construction of the Palais's current [[Belle \u00c9poque]]-style building began in 1885 under the direction of G\u00e9ry Legrand, mayor of Lille, and it was completed in 1892. The architects chosen to design the new building were Edouard B\u00e9rard (1843\u20131912) and Fernand Etienne-Charles Delmas (1852\u20131933) from Paris. The building is located on the place de la R\u00e9publique, in the center of the city, facing the [[Prefectures in France|pr\u00e9fecture]] of Lille. It was renovated during the 1990s and reopened in 1997.\n\nAt the start of the 1990s, the building's poor state and the moving of [[S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Vauban]]'s relief models of fortified towns to Lille forced the town to renovate the building. Work began in 1991, under the architects Jean-Marc Ibos and Myrto Vitart, and was completed in 1997. This allowed the creation of a new 700 m<sup>2</sup> basement room for temporary exhibitions, as well as departments for the relief models and for 19th-century sculpture. Overall the museum covers 22000 m<sup>2</sup> and held 72430 pieces as of 2015, one of the largest provincial collections of fine art. The collection includes works by [[Raphael]], [[Donatello]], [[Anthony van Dyck|Van Dyck]], [[James Tissot|Tissot]], [[Jacob Jordaens|Jordaens]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Francisco Goya|Goya]], [[El Greco]], [[Jacques-Louis David|David]], [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Corot]], [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Rubens]], [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]], [[Camille Claudel|Claudel]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Chardin]].\n\n== Collections ==\n\n=== Antiquities, Middle Ages and Renaissance ===\n[[Image:Dieric Bouts 001.jpg|thumb|right|''Ascension of the Elect'' by [[Dirk Bouts]].]]\n* ''Ascension of the Elect'', [[Dirk Bouts]], oil on wood (c 1450)\n* ''Fall of the Damned'', [[Dirk Bouts]], oil on wood (c 1450)\n* ''Portrait of man, skull in a niche'', [[Barthel Bruyn]], oil on wood\n* ''Three donors with Saint John the Baptist'', [[Barthel Bruyn the Younger]], oil on wood\n* ''The Virgin and the Sleeping Jesus'', [[Joos van Cleve]], oil on wood (16th century)\n* ''The Virgin nursing the Infant Jesus'', [[Joos van Cleve]], oil on wood (16th century)\n* ''Christ blessing the Virgin'', [[Jacob Cornelisz van Amsterdam]], oil on wood (16th century)\n* ''The Virgin, the Infant Jesus and saint Cecilia'', [[Domenico Panetti]]\n* ''Trinity, triptych of Marchiennes'', [[Jean Bellegambe]], oil on wood (c 1510)\n* ''Triptych of the mystic bath'', [[Jehan Bellegambe]], oil on wood (1510)\n* ''Feast of Herod'', [[Donatello]], marble (vers 1435)\n* ''Vanity'', [[Jan Sanders van Hemessen]], oil on wood (c 1535-1540)\n* ''Virgin and Child surrounded by angels'', [[Master of the foliage in embroidery]], triptych, oil on wood (c 1495-1500)\n* ''Portraits of Louis de Quarre and Barbe de Cruysinck as donors ; saint Barbara and saint Louis on foot under arcades'', [[Master of the foliage in embroidery]], oil on wood (c 1495-1500)\n* ''The Virgin in glory amidst the apostles'', [[Master of the Lyversberg Passion]], oil on wood (c 1460-1480)\n* ''Adoration of the Shepherds'', [[Ma\u00eester of the Lille Adoration]], oil on wood (1520)\n* ''Preaching of saint John the Baptist'', [[Master of the Lille Preaching]], oil on wood (1530\u20131540)\n* ''Vierge au lait'', [[Ma\u00eetre des Madones mosanes]], marble (c 1350)\n* ''Adoration of the Magi'', [[Ma\u00eetre MS]], oil on wood (c 1506-1510)\n* ''Saint Dorothea'' and ''Saint Mary Magdalen'', [[Master of saint-S\u00e9verin]], two panels, oil on wood (1480\u20131520)\n* ''[[Noli me tangere (Sustris)|Noli me tangere]]'', [[Lambert Sustris]] (1548-1560)\n* ''The Resurrection'' and ''La Vierge du rosaire'', anonymous, South German, oil on wood (c 1480-1490)\n* ''Adoration of the Magi'', anonymous, triptych, oil on wood (c 1510-1520)\n* ''Saint Henri and saint Cun\u00e9gonde, saint Jerome and a bishop saint, [[predella]] of the retable of saint George'', anonymous, Tyrol, oil on wood (c 1520)\n* ''Saint John the Baptist and saint Catherine'', anonymous, German, oil on wood (16th century)\n* ''Saint Barbara and two saints'', anonymous, German, oil on wood (16th century)\n* ''Sketch for Paradise'', [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], oil on wood\n\n=== 17th-century paintings ===\n[[Image:La descente de croix Rubens.jpg|thumb|right|''Descent from the Cross'' by [[Rubens]]]]\n[[Image:0 La Lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 du roi -

It is one of the [[list of largest art museums in the world|largest]] art museums in France.\n\nIt was one of the first museums built in France, established under the instructions of [[Napoleon I]] at the beginning of the 19th century as part of the popularisation of art. [[Jean-Antoine Chaptal]]'s decree of 1801 selected fifteen French cities (among which Lille) to receive the works seized from churches and from the European territories occupied by the armies of Revolutionary France. The painters [[Louis Joseph Watteau]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Watteau]], known as the \"Watteau of Lille\", were heavily involved in the museum's beginnings - Louis Joseph Watteau made in 1795 the first inventory of the paintings confiscated during the Revolution, whilst his son Fran\u00e7ois was deputy curator of the museum from 1808 to 1823.\n\nThe museum opened in 1809 and was initially housed in a church confiscated from the [[R\u00e9collets]] before being transferred to the city's town hall. In 1866, the \"mus\u00e9e Wicar\", formed from the collection of [[Jean-Baptiste Wicar]], was merged into the Palais des Beaux-Arts. Construction of the Palais's current [[Belle \u00c9poque]]-style building began in 1885 under the direction of G\u00e9ry Legrand, mayor of Lille, and it was completed in 1892. The architects chosen to design the new building were Edouard B\u00e9rard (1843\u20131912) and Fernand Etienne-Charles Delmas (1852\u20131933) from Paris. The building is located on the place de la R\u00e9publique, in the center of the city, facing the [[Prefectures in France|pr\u00e9fecture]] of Lille. It was renovated during the 1990s and reopened in 1997.\n\nAt the start of the 1990s, the building's poor state and the moving of [[S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Vauban]]'s relief models of fortified towns to Lille forced the town to renovate the building. Work began in 1991, under the architects Jean-Marc Ibos and Myrto Vitart, and was completed in 1997. This allowed the creation of a new 700 m<sup>2</sup> basement room for temporary exhibitions, as well as departments for the relief models and for 19th-century sculpture. Overall the museum covers 22000 m<sup>2</sup> and held 72430 pieces as of 2015, one of the largest provincial collections of fine art. The collection includes works by [[Raphael]], [[Donatello]], [[Anthony van Dyck|Van Dyck]], [[James Tissot|Tissot]], [[Jacob Jordaens|Jordaens]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Francisco Goya|Goya]], [[El Greco]], [[Jacques-Louis David|David]], [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Corot]], [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Rubens]], [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]], [[Camille Claudel|Claudel]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Chardin]].\n\n== Collections ==\n\n=== Antiquities, Middle Ages and Renaissance ===\n[[Image:Dieric Bouts 001.jpg|thumb|right|''Ascension of the Elect'' by [[Dirk Bouts]].]]\n* ''Ascension of the Elect'', [[Dirk Bouts]], oil on wood (c 1450)\n* ''Fall of the Damned'', [[Dirk Bouts]], oil on wood (c 1450)\n* ''Portrait of man, skull in a niche'', [[Barthel Bruyn]], oil on wood\n* ''Three donors with Saint John the Baptist'', [[Barthel Bruyn the Younger]], oil on wood\n* ''The Virgin and the Sleeping Jesus'', [[Joos van Cleve]], oil on wood (16th century)\n* ''The Virgin nursing the Infant Jesus'', [[Joos van Cleve]], oil on wood (16th century)\n* ''Christ blessing the Virgin'', [[Jacob Cornelisz van Amsterdam]], oil on wood (16th century)\n* ''The Virgin, the Infant Jesus and saint Cecilia'', [[Domenico Panetti]]\n* ''Trinity, triptych of Marchiennes'', [[Jean Bellegambe]], oil on wood (c 1510)\n* ''Triptych of the mystic bath'', [[Jehan Bellegambe]], oil on wood (1510)\n* ''Feast of Herod'', [[Donatello]], marble (vers 1435)\n* ''Vanity'', [[Jan Sanders van Hemessen]], oil on wood (c 1535-1540)\n* ''Virgin and Child surrounded by angels'', [[Master of the foliage in embroidery]], triptych, oil on wood (c 1495-1500)\n* ''Portraits of Louis de Quarre and Barbe de Cruysinck as donors ; saint Barbara and saint Louis on foot under arcades'', [[Master of the foliage in embroidery]], oil on wood (c 1495-1500)\n* ''The Virgin in glory amidst the apostles'', [[Master of the Lyversberg Passion]], oil on wood (c 1460-1480)\n* ''Adoration of the Shepherds'', [[Ma\u00eester of the Lille Adoration]], oil on wood (1520)\n* ''Preaching of saint John the Baptist'', [[Master of the Lille Preaching]], oil on wood (1530\u20131540)\n* ''Vierge au lait'', [[Ma\u00eetre des Madones mosanes]], marble (c 1350)\n* ''Adoration of the Magi'', [[Ma\u00eetre MS]], oil on wood (c 1506-1510)\n* ''Saint Dorothea'' and ''Saint Mary Magdalen'', [[Master of saint-S\u00e9verin]], two panels, oil on wood (1480\u20131520)\n* ''[[Noli me tangere (Sustris)|Noli me tangere]]'', [[Lambert Sustris]] (1548-1560)\n* ''The Resurrection'' and ''La Vierge du rosaire'', anonymous, South German, oil on wood (c 1480-1490)\n* ''Adoration of the Magi'', anonymous, triptych, oil on wood (c 1510-1520)\n* ''Saint Henri and saint Cun\u00e9gonde, saint Jerome and a bishop saint, [[predella]] of the retable of saint George'', anonymous, Tyrol, oil on wood (c 1520)\n* ''Saint John the Baptist and saint Catherine'', anonymous, German, oil on wood (16th century)\n* ''Saint Barbara and two saints'', anonymous, German, oil on wood (16th century)\n* ''Sketch for Paradise'', [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], oil on wood\n\n=== 17th-century paintings ===\n[[Image:La descente de croix Rubens.jpg|thumb|right|''Descent from the Cross'' by [[Rubens]]]]\n[[Image:0 La Lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 du roi -

Firstly that the surrounding woods needed to be cleared for a better defence of the town, so Ogulin received its name because of the resulting bare area (\"ogolio\" in Croatian) around it.  There were a lot of lime-trees along the road from Ogulin towards O\u0161tarije, and the people used to peel the bark, in order to get bass{{clarify|date=January 2016}}.  It is suggested that Ogulin got its name from the verb to peel (\"guliti\" in Croatian).  Neither proposal is historically confirmed.\n\n==History==\nOgulin's history dates back to the fifteenth century, when it struggled against the [[Ottoman Turks]].  The exact timing of the building of the Ogulin tower has not been established.  However, a document issued by Bernardin Frankopan in his town of [[Tr\u017ean Castle in Modru\u0161|Modru\u0161]] at around 1500 AD marked off the boundaries of new castle between Modru\u0161 and Vitunj, and this is, at the same time, the first historical mention of Ogulin. <!--Ogulin was named Julija's town on the first geographical map of Croatia, made by the Jesuit cartographer Stjepan Glava\u010d in 1673. ---it is disinformation transcribed everywhere--> Ogulin is known for the legend of \u0110ula (also Zuleika or Zula) who threw herself into the abyss of the River Dobra because of an unhappy love affair.<ref name=\"Ratkovi\u0107 2007\"/>  In the sixteenth century, it became a military stronghold against the Ottomans.\n\nFor a brief time, between 1809 and 1813, Ogulin was a part of the [[Illyrian Provinces]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tz-grada-ogulina.hr/ogulin/povijest-ogulina/|title=Povijest Ogulina - Turisti\u010dka zajednica Grada Ogulina|website=Tz-grada-ogulina.hr|accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nUntil 1918, Ogulin was part of the [[Austrian monarchy]] ([[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]], [[Modru\u0161-Rijeka County]], after the [[compromise of 1867]]), in the [[Croatian Military Frontier]].<ref>Handbook of Austria and Lombardy-Venetia Cancellations on the Postage Stamp Issues 1850-1864, by Edwin MUELLER, 1961.</ref>  It was administered by the ''Oguliner Grenz-Infanterie-Regiment N\u00b0III'' before 1881.\n\n==Geography==\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2011}}\n[[File:Ogulin map plan.png|thumb|right|300px|City map of Ogulin]]\n[[File:Der Hexenberg Klek bei Ogulin.JPG|thumb|left|[[Klek mountain, Croatia|Klek]] mountain]]\n[[File:Ribarici.jpg|thumb|left|Sabljaci lake near Ogulin]]\nThe town of Ogulin is situated in the very centre of mainland Croatia, between [[Zagreb]] and [[Rijeka]].  It was founded in a large valley formed by two rivers: the [[Dobra (Kupa)|Dobra]] and [[Zagorska Mre\u017enica]].  The administrative constitution of the town of Ogulin covers the area of 543.32&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>,<ref name=\"polozaj\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ogulin.hr/o-gradu/polozaj|title=Polo\u017eaj|website=Ogulin.hr|accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref> and has about 14,000 inhabitants according to 2011 census.\n\nThis is a kind of transitional micro-region neighbouring the larger regions of Croatia - [[Gorski Kotar]], [[Lika]], [[Kordun]] and Gornje [[Pokuplje]]. The Ogulin-Modru\u0161 valley finishes towards the south where the Modru\u0161 hills pass into the second largest field of the area under [[Mala Kapela|Kapela]]-[[Pla\u0161ki]] [[Polje]]. This comprises a completed geographical whole border on the western side by the mountain massif of [[Velika Kapela]] dominated by [[Klek mountain, Croatia|Klek]] (1181&nbsp;m).

Sylvan Hills' administration officials were enforcing the PCSSD policy regarding cell phone use by students while in the classroom, which is a violation of the PCSSD Student Handbook.  According to the district's handbook, such a violation allows officials to confiscate the phone for two weeks before returning the device. These actions eventually resulted in the lawsuit ''Koch v. Adams'' on the basis that the officials' actions resulted in [[Conversion (law)|conversion]] and [[trespass to chattels]]. The trial court dismissed the case, which subsequently led to the case being heard by the [[Arkansas Supreme Court]], which by unanimous decision had upheld the school district's policy and the lower court's decision to allow such confiscation and that no violation of state or federal policy occurred.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://courts.arkansas.gov/court_opinions/sc/2010a/20100318/Koch%20v.%20Adams.pdf |title=2010 Ark. 131 |last1=Brown, Associate Judge |first=Robert L. |publisher=Arkansas Supreme Court |accessdate=August 13, 2012}}</ref> As school districts around the United States have similar policies regarding students' cell phone use in classrooms, this legal decision has been widely discussed in the education community.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nsba.org/TEMP/LegalClips/Koch-v-Adams.html |title=Arkansas Supreme Court upholds school officials' confiscation of student's cell phone |publisher=National School Boards Association |access-date=August 13, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307081823/http://www.nsba.org/TEMP/LegalClips/Koch-v-Adams.html |archive-date=March 7, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iapss-in.org/subsite/dist/page/may-2010-legal-issues-236 |title=Students Rights & Discipline, Arkansas Supreme Court upholds school officials' confiscation of student's cell phone |publisher=Indiana Association of Public School Superintendents |accessdate=September 19, 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n=== Awards and recognition ===\nSince 1993, Sylvan Hills High School has been an institutional member of The College Board.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://apps.collegeboard.org/cbsearch/searchMInstitution.jsp?searchaction=display&PAGECOUNT=20&STARTPAGE=80 |title=Institutional Member : Search > Arkansas |publisher=College Board |accessdate=November 15, 2013}}</ref> In 2008, Sylvan Hills was recognized with an Arkansas Picturing America Award,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://picturingamerica.neh.gov/ |title=Picturing America |access-date=November 12, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123084231/https://picturingamerica.neh.gov/ |archive-date=November 23, 2016  }} NEH Picture America</ref> which is an initiative by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] that brings masterpieces of American art into classrooms and libraries nationwide.\n\nA Sylvan Hills student was named one of Arkansas' top two youth volunteers for 2009 by The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards, a nationwide program honoring young people for acts of voluntarism.

According to the district's handbook, such a violation allows officials to confiscate the phone for two weeks before returning the device. These actions eventually resulted in the lawsuit ''Koch v. Adams'' on the basis that the officials' actions resulted in [[Conversion (law)|conversion]] and [[trespass to chattels]]. The trial court dismissed the case, which subsequently led to the case being heard by the [[Arkansas Supreme Court]], which by unanimous decision had upheld the school district's policy and the lower court's decision to allow such confiscation and that no violation of state or federal policy occurred.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://courts.arkansas.gov/court_opinions/sc/2010a/20100318/Koch%20v.%20Adams.pdf |title=2010 Ark. 131 |last1=Brown, Associate Judge |first=Robert L. |publisher=Arkansas Supreme Court |accessdate=August 13, 2012}}</ref> As school districts around the United States have similar policies regarding students' cell phone use in classrooms, this legal decision has been widely discussed in the education community.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nsba.org/TEMP/LegalClips/Koch-v-Adams.html |title=Arkansas Supreme Court upholds school officials' confiscation of student's cell phone |publisher=National School Boards Association |access-date=August 13, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307081823/http://www.nsba.org/TEMP/LegalClips/Koch-v-Adams.html |archive-date=March 7, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iapss-in.org/subsite/dist/page/may-2010-legal-issues-236 |title=Students Rights & Discipline, Arkansas Supreme Court upholds school officials' confiscation of student's cell phone |publisher=Indiana Association of Public School Superintendents |accessdate=September 19, 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n=== Awards and recognition ===\nSince 1993, Sylvan Hills High School has been an institutional member of The College Board.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://apps.collegeboard.org/cbsearch/searchMInstitution.jsp?searchaction=display&PAGECOUNT=20&STARTPAGE=80 |title=Institutional Member : Search > Arkansas |publisher=College Board |accessdate=November 15, 2013}}</ref> In 2008, Sylvan Hills was recognized with an Arkansas Picturing America Award,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://picturingamerica.neh.gov/ |title=Picturing America |access-date=November 12, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123084231/https://picturingamerica.neh.gov/ |archive-date=November 23, 2016  }} NEH Picture America</ref> which is an initiative by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] that brings masterpieces of American art into classrooms and libraries nationwide.\n\nA Sylvan Hills student was named one of Arkansas' top two youth volunteers for 2009 by The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards, a nationwide program honoring young people for acts of voluntarism.

Ben Cameron leads a heroic final charge at the [[Siege of Petersburg]], earning the nickname of \"the Little Colonel\", but he is also wounded and captured.

Also at the hospital, he meets Elsie Stoneman, whose picture he has been carrying; she is working there as a nurse. Elsie takes Cameron's mother, who had traveled to Washington to tend her son, to see [[Abraham Lincoln]], and Mrs. Cameron persuades the President to pardon Ben. When [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln is assassinated]] at [[Ford's Theatre]], his conciliatory postwar policy expires with him.

As a result, Elsie, out of loyalty to her father, breaks off her relationship with Ben. Later, Flora Cameron goes off alone into the woods to fetch water and is followed by Gus, a [[freedman]] and soldier who is now a captain. He confronts Flora and tells her that he desires to get married. Frightened, she flees into the forest, pursued by Gus. Trapped on a precipice, Flora warns Gus she will jump if he comes any closer. When he does, she leaps to her death. Having run through the forest looking for her, Ben has seen her jump; he holds her as she dies, then carries her body back to the Cameron home. In response, the Klan hunts down Gus, tries him, finds him guilty, and [[Lynching|lynches]] him.\n\nLynch then orders a crackdown on the Klan after discovering Gus's murder. He also secures the passing of legislation allowing [[interracial marriage|mixed-race marriages]]. Dr. Cameron is arrested for possessing Ben's [[Ku Klux Klan regalia and insignia|Klan regalia]], now considered a [[Capital punishment|capital crime]]. He is rescued by Phil Stoneman and a few of his black servants. Together with Margaret Cameron, they flee. When their wagon breaks down, they make their way through the woods to a small hut that is home to two sympathetic former Union soldiers who agree to hide them.

Gov. Lynch's crackdown. Elsie, learning of Dr. Cameron's arrest, goes to Lynch to plead for his release. Lynch, who had been lusting after Elsie, tries to force her to marry him, which causes her to faint. Stoneman returns, causing Elsie to be placed in another room.  At first Stoneman is happy when Lynch tells him he wants to marry a white woman, but he is then angered when Lynch tells him that it is Stoneman's daughter. Undercover Klansman spies go to get help when they discover Elsie's plight after she breaks a window and cries out for help. Elsie falls unconscious again and revives while gagged and being bound. The Klan gathered together, with Ben leading them, ride in to gain control of the town. When news about Elsie reaches Ben, he and others go to her rescue. Elsie frees her mouth and screams for help. Lynch is captured. Victorious, the Klansmen celebrate in the streets. Meanwhile, Lynch's militia surrounds and attacks the hut where the Camerons are hiding. The Klansmen, with Ben at their head, race in to save them just in time. The next election day, blacks find a line of mounted and armed Klansmen just outside their homes and are intimidated into not voting.\n\nThe film concludes with a double wedding as Margaret Cameron marries Phil Stoneman and Elsie Stoneman marries Ben Cameron. The masses are shown oppressed by a giant warlike figure who gradually fades away. The scene shifts to another group finding peace under the image of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]].

It's tempting to think of the film's influence as evidence of the inherent corruption of realism as a cinematic mode\u2014but it's even more revealing to acknowledge the disjunction between its beauty, on the one hand, and, on the other, its injustice and falsehood. The movie's fabricated events shouldn't lead any viewer to deny the historical facts of slavery and Reconstruction. But they also shouldn't lead to a denial of the peculiar, disturbingly exalted beauty of ''Birth of a Nation'', even in its depiction of immoral actions and its realization of blatant propaganda. The worst thing about ''The Birth of a Nation'' is how good it is. The merits of its grand and enduring aesthetic make it impossible to ignore and, despite its disgusting content, also make it hard not to love. And it's that very conflict that renders the film all the more despicable, the experience of the film more of a torment\u2014together with the acknowledgment that Griffith, whose short films for Biograph were already among the treasures of world cinema, yoked his mighty talent to the cause of hatred (which, still worse, he sincerely depicted as virtuous).<ref name=\"Brody\"/></blockquote>\n\nBrody also argued that Griffith unintentionally undercut his own thesis in the film, citing the scene before the Civil War when the Cameron family offers up lavish hospitality to the Stoneman family who travel past mile after mile of slaves working the cotton fields of South Carolina to reach the Cameron home-maintaining that a modern audience can see that the wealth of the Camerons comes from the slaves forced to do back-breaking work picking the cotton. Likewise, Brody argued that the scene where people in South Carolina celebrate the Confederate victory at the [[First Battle of Bull Run|Battle of Bull Run]] by dancing around the \"eerie flare of a bonfire\" which imply \"a dance of death\", foreshadowing the destruction of [[Sherman's March to the Sea|Sherman's March]] that was to come. In the same way, Brody wrote that the scene where the Klan dumps Gus's body off at the doorstep of Lynch is meant to have the audience cheering, but modern audiences find the scene \"obscene and horrifying\". Finally, Brody argued that the end of the film, where the Klan prevents defenseless African-Americans from exercising their right to vote by pointing guns at them, today seems \"unjust and cruel\".<ref name=\"Brody\"/>\n\nIn an article for ''[[The Atlantic]]'', film critic [[Ty Burr]] deemed ''The Birth of a Nation'' the most influential film in history while criticizing its portrayal of black men as savage.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/03/what-was-the-most-influential-film-in-history/513863/|title=What Was the Most Influential Film in History?|website=[[The Atlantic]]|date=March 2017|accessdate=February 26, 2018}}</ref> Richard Corliss of ''Time'' wrote that Griffith \"established in the hundreds of one- and two-reelers he directed a cinematic textbook, a fully formed visual language, for the generations that followed.

Elsie takes Cameron's mother, who had traveled to Washington to tend her son, to see [[Abraham Lincoln]], and Mrs. Cameron persuades the President to pardon Ben. When [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln is assassinated]] at [[Ford's Theatre]], his conciliatory postwar policy expires with him. In the wake of the president's death, Austin Stoneman and other [[Radical Republican]]s are determined to punish the South, employing harsh measures that Griffith depicts as having been typical of the [[Reconstruction Era]].<ref>Griffith followed the then-dominant [[Dunning School]] or \"Tragic Era\" view of Reconstruction presented by early 20th-century historians such as [[William Archibald Dunning]] and [[Claude G.

During the election, in which Lynch is elected [[Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina|lieutenant governor]], blacks are observed [[Ballot box stuffing|stuffing the ballot boxes]], while [[Reconstruction era#Suffrage|many whites are denied the vote]]. The newly elected, mostly black members of the [[South Carolina General Assembly|South Carolina legislature]] are shown at their desks displaying inappropriate behavior, such as one member taking off his shoe and putting his feet up on his desk, and others drinking liquor and feasting on [[Fried chicken#Racial stereotype|fried chicken]].\n[[File:Birth-of-a-nation-klan-and-black-man.jpg|thumb|left|Hooded Klansmen catch Gus, portrayed in [[blackface]] by white actor [[Walter Long (actor)|Walter Long]].]]\n\nMeanwhile, inspired by observing white children pretending to be ghosts to scare black children, Ben fights back by forming the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. As a result, Elsie, out of loyalty to her father, breaks off her relationship with Ben. Later, Flora Cameron goes off alone into the woods to fetch water and is followed by Gus, a [[freedman]] and soldier who is now a captain. He confronts Flora and tells her that he desires to get married. Frightened, she flees into the forest, pursued by Gus. Trapped on a precipice, Flora warns Gus she will jump if he comes any closer. When he does, she leaps to her death. Having run through the forest looking for her, Ben has seen her jump; he holds her as she dies, then carries her body back to the Cameron home. In response, the Klan hunts down Gus, tries him, finds him guilty, and [[Lynching|lynches]] him.\n\nLynch then orders a crackdown on the Klan after discovering Gus's murder. He also secures the passing of legislation allowing [[interracial marriage|mixed-race marriages]]. Dr. Cameron is arrested for possessing Ben's [[Ku Klux Klan regalia and insignia|Klan regalia]], now considered a [[Capital punishment|capital crime]]. He is rescued by Phil Stoneman and a few of his black servants. Together with Margaret Cameron, they flee. When their wagon breaks down, they make their way through the woods to a small hut that is home to two sympathetic former Union soldiers who agree to hide them.

Gov. Lynch's crackdown. Elsie, learning of Dr. Cameron's arrest, goes to Lynch to plead for his release. Lynch, who had been lusting after Elsie, tries to force her to marry him, which causes her to faint. Stoneman returns, causing Elsie to be placed in another room.  At first Stoneman is happy when Lynch tells him he wants to marry a white woman, but he is then angered when Lynch tells him that it is Stoneman's daughter. Undercover Klansman spies go to get help when they discover Elsie's plight after she breaks a window and cries out for help. Elsie falls unconscious again and revives while gagged and being bound. The Klan gathered together, with Ben leading them, ride in to gain control of the town. When news about Elsie reaches Ben, he and others go to her rescue. Elsie frees her mouth and screams for help. Lynch is captured. Victorious, the Klansmen celebrate in the streets. Meanwhile, Lynch's militia surrounds and attacks the hut where the Camerons are hiding. The Klansmen, with Ben at their head, race in to save them just in time. The next election day, blacks find a line of mounted and armed Klansmen just outside their homes and are intimidated into not voting.\n\nThe film concludes with a double wedding as Margaret Cameron marries Phil Stoneman and Elsie Stoneman marries Ben Cameron. The masses are shown oppressed by a giant warlike figure who gradually fades away. The scene shifts to another group finding peace under the image of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]].

It's tempting to think of the film's influence as evidence of the inherent corruption of realism as a cinematic mode\u2014but it's even more revealing to acknowledge the disjunction between its beauty, on the one hand, and, on the other, its injustice and falsehood. The movie's fabricated events shouldn't lead any viewer to deny the historical facts of slavery and Reconstruction. But they also shouldn't lead to a denial of the peculiar, disturbingly exalted beauty of ''Birth of a Nation'', even in its depiction of immoral actions and its realization of blatant propaganda. The worst thing about ''The Birth of a Nation'' is how good it is. The merits of its grand and enduring aesthetic make it impossible to ignore and, despite its disgusting content, also make it hard not to love. And it's that very conflict that renders the film all the more despicable, the experience of the film more of a torment\u2014together with the acknowledgment that Griffith, whose short films for Biograph were already among the treasures of world cinema, yoked his mighty talent to the cause of hatred (which, still worse, he sincerely depicted as virtuous).<ref name=\"Brody\"/></blockquote>\n\nBrody also argued that Griffith unintentionally undercut his own thesis in the film, citing the scene before the Civil War when the Cameron family offers up lavish hospitality to the Stoneman family who travel past mile after mile of slaves working the cotton fields of South Carolina to reach the Cameron home-maintaining that a modern audience can see that the wealth of the Camerons comes from the slaves forced to do back-breaking work picking the cotton. Likewise, Brody argued that the scene where people in South Carolina celebrate the Confederate victory at the [[First Battle of Bull Run|Battle of Bull Run]] by dancing around the \"eerie flare of a bonfire\" which imply \"a dance of death\", foreshadowing the destruction of [[Sherman's March to the Sea|Sherman's March]] that was to come. In the same way, Brody wrote that the scene where the Klan dumps Gus's body off at the doorstep of Lynch is meant to have the audience cheering, but modern audiences find the scene \"obscene and horrifying\". Finally, Brody argued that the end of the film, where the Klan prevents defenseless African-Americans from exercising their right to vote by pointing guns at them, today seems \"unjust and cruel\".<ref name=\"Brody\"/>\n\nIn an article for ''[[The Atlantic]]'', film critic [[Ty Burr]] deemed ''The Birth of a Nation'' the most influential film in history while criticizing its portrayal of black men as savage.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/03/what-was-the-most-influential-film-in-history/513863/|title=What Was the Most Influential Film in History?|website=[[The Atlantic]]|date=March 2017|accessdate=February 26, 2018}}</ref> Richard Corliss of ''Time'' wrote that Griffith \"established in the hundreds of one- and two-reelers he directed a cinematic textbook, a fully formed visual language, for the generations that followed.

Merton Coulter]] in his ''The South Under Reconstruction'' (1947), maintained the Dunning School view after World War II. Today, the Dunning School position is largely seen as a product of anti-black racism of the early 20th century, by which many white Americans held that black Americans were unequal as citizens.

Building on [[Black Reconstruction in America|W. E. B.

This stemmed from several factors, one of which was the fact that Griffith and others had frequently reworked the film, leaving no definitive version.

A short documentary, ''The Making of The Birth of a Nation'', newly produced and narrated by Shepard, was also included. Both were released on [[DVD]] by Image in 1998 and the [[United Kingdom]]'s Eureka Entertainment in 2000.<ref name=\"Brenton Film\" />\n\nIn the UK, [[Photoplay Productions]] restored the [[Museum of Modern Art]]'s [[35mm movie film|35mm]] print that was the source of Shepard's 16&nbsp;mm print, though they also augmented it with extra material from the [[British Film Institute]]. It was also given a full orchestral recording of the original Breil score.

It never bogged me down in useless desktop drivel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://desktoplinuxreviews.com/crunchbang-reviews/crunchbang-11-waldorf/ |title=CrunchBang 11 Waldorf Review |publisher=Desktoplinuxreviews.com |first=Jim |last=Lynch |date=2013-05-21 |accessdate=2013-05-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522193322/http://desktoplinuxreviews.com/crunchbang-reviews/crunchbang-11-waldorf/ |archivedate=2013-05-22 }}</ref>}}\n\n== Successors ==\nNewborough announced in February 2015 that he was abandoning further development of CrunchBang Linux, feeling that it no longer served a purpose.<ref>{{cite web|title=The end|first=Philip|last=Newborough|date=February 6, 2015|url=http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=38916|work=CrunchBang Forum|accessdate=28 August 2015}}</ref> The users did not all agree, and a number proceeded to develop successor distributions BunsenLabs, CrunchBang++ (#!++) and CrunchBang-Monara.\n\n=== BunsenLabs ===\n[[File:BunsenLabs Helium cdsized R4.png|thumb|right|BunsenLabs Helium R4 ''cdsized'']]\nBunsenLabs Linux is a community-organized successor to Crunchbang.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://crunchbanglinux.org/ |title=CrunchBang \u2013 a nimble Openbox Linux Distro |work=crunchbanglinux.org |accessdate=12 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=39049 |title=A community continuation: BunsenLabs (Page 1) / News & Announcements |work=CrunchBang Linux Forums |accessdate=12 September 2015}}</ref> It is based on the [[Debian version history#Debian 9 (Stretch)|Debian 9 (Stretch)]]<ref>https://wiki.debian.org/DebianStretch</ref> stable release.<ref>https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Census/BunsenLabs</ref><ref>https://forums.bunsenlabs.org/viewtopic.php?id=4772</ref> Between 17 and 30 September 2015, CrunchBang's domain began redirecting to [https://www.bunsenlabs.org/ BunsenLabs].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://crunchbang.org/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-09-30 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150930135019/http://crunchbang.org/ |archivedate=2015-09-30 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBunsenLabs is one of the few modern Debian-based live distributions that still offers a CD edition with both the X Window System and a modern version of Firefox, making the distro useful for running on old computers with just around 1 GB of RAM memory.\n\n=== CrunchBang++ ===\nCrunchBang PlusPlus (#!++) was developed in response to Newborough's announcement of the end of CrunchBang.<ref name=Lynch>{{cite web|url=http://jimlynch.com/linux-articles/crunchbang-linux-is-back-from-the-dead/|title=CrunchBang Linux is back from the dead|first=Jim|last=Lynch|work=JimLynch.com}}</ref> It is currently based on the [[Debian]] Buster (release 10.1) distribution.<ref name=Lynch/> Release 1.0 was announced on 29 April 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://crunchbangplusplus.org/news/|title=News|work=CrunchBangPlusPlus.org|accessdate=28 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907080958/https://crunchbangplusplus.org/news/|archive-date=7 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The latest version based on Debian 10.0 was released on 8 July 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/CBPP/crunchbangplusplus.org/commit/8ebdb788f6bd47c982539d074a3b8db5f0f235c4|title=More 10s|date=8 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== CrunchBang-Monara ===\nCrunchBang-Monara is another successor to CrunchBang.
