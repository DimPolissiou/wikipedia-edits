Her work exemplifies [[Modernism]] and in particular modern sculpture. She was one of the few female artists of her generation to achieve international prominence.<ref name=gale/> Along with artists such as [[Ben Nicholson]] and [[Naum Gabo]], Hepworth was a leading figure in the colony of artists who resided in [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]] during the [[Second World War]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early Life===\nJocelyn Barbara Hepworth was born on 10 January 1903 in [[Wakefield]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], the eldest child of Gertrude and Herbert Hepworth.<ref name=\"bio\" /> Her father was a civil engineer for the West Riding County Council, who in 1921 became County Surveyor.<ref name=\"bio\" /> Hepworth attended [[Wakefield Girls' High School]], where she was awarded music prizes at the age of twelve <ref>as noted by Sophie Bowness in \"Rhythm of the Stones:  Barbara Hepworth and Music\" {{cite book |title=Barbara Hepworth: Centenary |last= |first= |publisher=Tate Publishing |year=2003 |isbn=1-85437-479-6 |location= |page=[https://archive.org/details/barbarahepworth00chri/page/25 25] |url=https://archive.org/details/barbarahepworth00chri/page/25 }}</ref><ref name=\"hepworth1970\">{{cite book |first1=Barbara |last1=Hepworth |title=Barbara Hepworth: A Pictorial Autobiography |publisher=Praeger Publishers |date=1970 |edition=1st |location=New York |lccn=73-99496}}</ref> and won a scholarship to and studied at the [[Leeds School of Art]] from 1920. It was there that she met her fellow Yorkshireman, [[Henry Moore]].<ref name=\"bio\" /> They became friends and established a friendly rivalry that lasted professionally for many years. Hepworth was the first to sculpt the pierced figures that are characteristic of works by both. They would lead in the path to modernism in sculpture.\n\nDespite attempting to gain a position in what was a male-dominated environment,<ref>{{cite book |last=Festing |first=Sally |title=Barbara Hepworth: A Life of Forms |date=1995 |pages=xviii, 24}}</ref> Hepworth successfully won a county scholarship to attend the [[Royal College of Art]] (RCA) in London, and studied there from 1921 until she was awarded the diploma of the Royal College of Art in 1924.<ref name=\"ccc\" />\n\n===Early career===\nFollowing her studies at the RCA, Hepworth travelled to [[Florence]], Italy, in 1924 on a [[West Riding]] Travel Scholarship.<ref name=gale/> Hepworth was also the runner-up for the [[Prix-de-Rome]], which the sculptor [[John Skeaping]] won.<ref name=gale/> After travelling with him to Siena and Rome, Hepworth married Skeaping on 13 May 1925 in Florence.<ref name=bio/> In Italy, Hepworth learned how to carve marble from the master sculptor, Giovanni Ardini.<ref name=bio/> Hepworth and Skeaping returned to London in 1926, where they exhibited their works together from their flat.<ref name=bio/> Their son Paul was born in London in 1929.<ref name=gale/>\nHer early work was highly interested in abstraction and art movements on the continent. In 1933, Hepworth travelled with [[Ben Nicholson]] to France, where they visited the studios of [[Jean Arp]], [[Pablo Picasso]], and [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u015fi]].<ref name=bio/> Hepworth later became involved with the Paris-based art movement, [[Abstraction-Cr\u00e9ation]].<ref name=eb/> In 1933, Hepworth co-founded the [[Unit One]] art movement with Nicholson and [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], the critic [[Herbert Read]], and the architect [[Wells Coates]].<ref name=nash/> The movement sought to unite Surrealism and abstraction in British art.<ref name=nash/>\n\nHepworth also helped raise awareness of continental artists amongst the British public. In 1937, she designed the layout for ''[[Circle: An International Survey of Constructivist Art]]'', a 300-page book that surveyed Constructivist artists and that was published in London and edited by Nicholson, [[Naum Gabo]], and [[Leslie Martin]].<ref name=peggy/>\n\nHepworth married Nicholson on 17 November 1938 at [[Hampstead]] Register Office in north London, following his divorce from his wife [[Winifred Nicholson|Winifred]].<ref name=alan/> The couple had triplets in 1934, Rachel, Sarah, and Simon. Rachel and [[Simon Nicholson|Simon]] also became artists.<ref name=riggs/> For a woman of this period, the practicalities of dealing with multiple babies simultaneously were intense. Hepworth, atypically for the period, found a way to both take care of her children and continue producing her art. \"A woman artist,\" she argued, \"is not deprived by cooking and having children, nor by nursing children with measles (even in triplicate)&nbsp;\u2013 one is in fact nourished by this rich life, provided one always does some work each day; even a single half hour, so that the images grow in one's mind.\"<ref>quoted by Fiona MacCarthy in {{cite web |last1=MacCarthy |first1=Fiona |title=Touchy feely |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2003/may/17/art.artsfeatures |journal=Art Features |publisher=The Guardian |location=London |date=May 16, 2003}}</ref>\n\n===St Ives===\nHepworth, Nicholson and their children went to live in Cornwall at the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939.<ref name=tate/><ref name=\"Phaidon Editors\">{{cite book |last1=Phaidon Editors |title=Great women artists |date=2019 |publisher=Phaidon Press |isbn=0714878774 |page=183}}</ref>\n\nHepworth lived in Trewyn Studios in [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]] from 1949 until her death in 1975.<ref name=tate/> She said that \"Finding Trewyn Studio was sort of magic. Here was a studio, a yard, and garden where I could work in open air and space.\"<ref name=tate/> St Ives had become a refuge for many artists during the war. On 8 February 1949, Hepworth and Nicholson co-founded the [[Penwith Society of Arts]] at the Castle Inn; nineteen artists were founding members, including [[Peter Lanyon]] and [[Bernard Leach]].\n<ref name=penwith/>\n\nHepworth was also a skilled draughtsman.

Hepworth moved away from working only in stone or wood and began to work with bronze and clay.<ref name=tate/> Hepworth often used her garden in St Ives, which she designed with her friend the composer [[Priaulx Rainier]], to view her large-scale bronzes.<ref name=tate/>\n\n====Death of son Paul====\nHer eldest son, Paul, was killed on 13 February 1953 in a plane crash while serving with the [[Royal Air Force]] in Thailand.<ref name=stephens/> A memorial to him, ''Madonna and Child'', is in the [[St Ia's Church, St Ives|parish church of St Ives]].<ref name=bio1/>\n\nExhausted, in part from her son's death, Hepworth travelled to Greece with her good friend [[Margaret Gardiner (artist)|Margaret Gardiner]] in August 1954.<ref name=stephens/> They visited [[Athens]], [[Delphi]], and many of the [[Aegean Islands]].<ref name=stephens/>\n\nWhen Hepworth returned to St Ives from Greece in August 1954, she found that Gardiner had sent her a large shipment of Nigerian [[guarea]] hardwood.<ref name = stephens/> Although she received only a single tree trunk, Hepworth noted that the shipment from Nigeria to the Tilbury docks came in at 17 tons.<ref name = stephens/> Between 1954\u20131956 Hepworth sculpted six pieces out of guarea wood, many of which were inspired by her trip to Greece, such as \"Corinthos\" (1954) and \"Curved Form (Delphi)\" (1955).<ref name = stephens/>\n\n===Ambivalent Burden of International Reputation===\nIt was also during this decade that Hepworth sought to establish a market base for her work in the [[United States]]. Initially she hoped to follow Henry Moore's successful sale of artwork via [[Curt Valentin]] of Bucholz Gallery in New York. Negotiations with Valentin did result in a number of American sales. But despite the sales, and despite interventions by Hepworth's friends, Valentin rebuffed repeated requests to hold any substantial stock of her work. It was not until 1955, after the Martha Jackson Gallery had offered Hepworth the opportunity to exhibit in their space alongside works by [[William Scott (artist)|William Scott]] and [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], that Hepworth formalized gallery representation in the new world.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Roberts |first1=Emma |title=Representation and Reputation: Barbara Hepworth\u2019s Relationships with her American and British Dealers |url=https://www.tate.org.uk/research/publications/tate-papers/20/representation-and-reputation-barbara-hepworths-relationships-with-her-american-and-british-dealers|journal=Tate Papers 20, Autumn 2013|publisher=Tate Gallery |location=London |ISSN= 1753-9854 |date=2013}}</ref>\n\nHepworth's difficulties in establishing a stable gallery relationship in the United States have been attributed to many factors, including the artist's own diffidence regarding personal promotion of her work. When Martha Jackson failed to arrange the solo American exhibition of sculptures and drawings that Hepworth demanded, Hepworth moved, in 1957, to [[Galerie Chalette]], run by Arthur and Madeleine Lejwa, known for their close relationship with [[Jean Arp]], and dedication to close relationships with their artists.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://artdaily.cc/news/108881/Christie-s-announces-selections-from-the-Israel-Museum-to-benefit-the-acquisitions-fund | title=Christie's announces selections from the Israel Museum to benefit the acquisitions fund | publisher=Art Daily | date=2018 | accessdate=March 21, 2020 }}</ref> The Lejwas came through with the solo exhibition Hepworth craved.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Roberts |first1=Emma |title=Representation and Reputation: Barbara Hepworth\u2019s Relationships with her American and British Dealers |url=https://www.tate.org.uk/research/publications/tate-papers/20/representation-and-reputation-barbara-hepworths-relationships-with-her-american-and-british-dealers|journal=Tate Papers 20, Autumn 2013|publisher=Tate Gallery |location=London |ISSN= 1753-9854 |date=2013}}</ref> Hepworth came to New York for the opening (her first visit to the city),<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bowness |first1=Sophie |title=Barbara Hepworth Chronology |url=https://barbarahepworth.org.uk/biography/ |publisher=Hepworth Estate}}</ref>, but made minimal contact with the press and left as soon as possible. \"Have seen all the press,\" she wrote, \"pulled faces at the camera and generally done my best!\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Roberts |first1=Emma |title=Representation and Reputation: Barbara Hepworth\u2019s Relationships with her American and British Dealers |url=https://www.tate.org.uk/research/publications/tate-papers/20/representation-and-reputation-barbara-hepworths-relationships-with-her-american-and-british-dealers|journal=Tate Papers 20, Autumn 2013|publisher=Tate Gallery |location=London |ISSN= 1753-9854 |date=2013}}</ref>.

Her work exemplifies [[Modernism]] and in particular modern sculpture. She was one of the few female artists of her generation to achieve international prominence.<ref name=gale/> Along with artists such as [[Ben Nicholson]] and [[Naum Gabo]], Hepworth was a leading figure in the colony of artists who resided in [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]] during the [[Second World War]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early Life===\nJocelyn Barbara Hepworth was born on 10 January 1903 in [[Wakefield]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], the eldest child of Gertrude and Herbert Hepworth.<ref name=\"bio\" /> Her father was a civil engineer for the West Riding County Council, who in 1921 became County Surveyor.<ref name=\"bio\" /> Hepworth attended [[Wakefield Girls' High School]], where she was awarded music prizes at the age of twelve <ref>as noted by Sophie Bowness in \"Rhythm of the Stones:  Barbara Hepworth and Music\" {{cite book |title=Barbara Hepworth: Centenary |last= |first= |publisher=Tate Publishing |year=2003 |isbn=1-85437-479-6 |location= |page=[https://archive.org/details/barbarahepworth00chri/page/25 25] |url=https://archive.org/details/barbarahepworth00chri/page/25 }}</ref><ref name=\"hepworth1970\">{{cite book |first1=Barbara |last1=Hepworth |title=Barbara Hepworth: A Pictorial Autobiography |publisher=Praeger Publishers |date=1970 |edition=1st |location=New York |lccn=73-99496}}</ref> and won a scholarship to and studied at the [[Leeds School of Art]] from 1920. It was there that she met her fellow Yorkshireman, [[Henry Moore]].<ref name=\"bio\" /> They became friends and established a friendly rivalry that lasted professionally for many years. Hepworth was the first to sculpt the pierced figures that are characteristic of works by both. They would lead in the path to modernism in sculpture.\n\nDespite attempting to gain a position in what was a male-dominated environment,<ref>{{cite book |last=Festing |first=Sally |title=Barbara Hepworth: A Life of Forms |date=1995 |pages=xviii, 24}}</ref> Hepworth successfully won a county scholarship to attend the [[Royal College of Art]] (RCA) in London, and studied there from 1921 until she was awarded the diploma of the Royal College of Art in 1924.<ref name=\"ccc\" />\n\n===Early career===\nFollowing her studies at the RCA, Hepworth travelled to [[Florence]], Italy, in 1924 on a [[West Riding]] Travel Scholarship.<ref name=gale/> Hepworth was also the runner-up for the [[Prix-de-Rome]], which the sculptor [[John Skeaping]] won.<ref name=gale/> After travelling with him to Siena and Rome, Hepworth married Skeaping on 13 May 1925 in Florence.<ref name=bio/> In Italy, Hepworth learned how to carve marble from the master sculptor, Giovanni Ardini.<ref name=bio/> Hepworth and Skeaping returned to London in 1926, where they exhibited their works together from their flat.<ref name=bio/> Their son Paul was born in London in 1929.<ref name=gale/>\nHer early work was highly interested in abstraction and art movements on the continent. In 1933, Hepworth travelled with [[Ben Nicholson]] to France, where they visited the studios of [[Jean Arp]], [[Pablo Picasso]], and [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u015fi]].<ref name=bio/> Hepworth later became involved with the Paris-based art movement, [[Abstraction-Cr\u00e9ation]].<ref name=eb/> In 1933, Hepworth co-founded the [[Unit One]] art movement with Nicholson and [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], the critic [[Herbert Read]], and the architect [[Wells Coates]].<ref name=nash/> The movement sought to unite Surrealism and abstraction in British art.<ref name=nash/>\n\nHepworth also helped raise awareness of continental artists amongst the British public. In 1937, she designed the layout for ''[[Circle: An International Survey of Constructivist Art]]'', a 300-page book that surveyed Constructivist artists and that was published in London and edited by Nicholson, [[Naum Gabo]], and [[Leslie Martin]].<ref name=peggy/>\n\nHepworth married Nicholson on 17 November 1938 at [[Hampstead]] Register Office in north London, following his divorce from his wife [[Winifred Nicholson|Winifred]].<ref name=alan/> The couple had triplets in 1934, Rachel, Sarah, and Simon. Rachel and [[Simon Nicholson|Simon]] also became artists.<ref name=riggs/> For a woman of this period, the practicalities of dealing with multiple babies simultaneously were intense. Hepworth, atypically for the period, found a way to both take care of her children and continue producing her art. \"A woman artist,\" she argued, \"is not deprived by cooking and having children, nor by nursing children with measles (even in triplicate) - one is in fact nourished by this rich life, provided one always does some work each day; even a single half hour, so that the images grow in one's mind.\"<ref>quoted by Fiona MacCarthy in {{cite web |last1=MacCarthy |first1=Fiona |title=Touchy feely |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2003/may/17/art.artsfeatures |journal=Art Features |publisher=The Guardian |location=London |date=May 16, 2003}}</ref>\n\n===St Ives===\nHepworth, Nicholson and their children went to live in Cornwall at the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939.<ref name=tate/><ref name=\"Phaidon Editors\">{{cite book |last1=Phaidon Editors |title=Great women artists |date=2019 |publisher=Phaidon Press |isbn=0714878774 |page=183}}</ref>\n\nHepworth lived in Trewyn Studios in [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]] from 1949 until her death in 1975.<ref name=tate/> She said that \"Finding Trewyn Studio was sort of magic. Here was a studio, a yard, and garden where I could work in open air and space.\"<ref name=tate/> St Ives had become a refuge for many artists during the war. On 8 February 1949, Hepworth and Nicholson co-founded the [[Penwith Society of Arts]] at the Castle Inn; nineteen artists were founding members, including [[Peter Lanyon]] and [[Bernard Leach]].\n<ref name=penwith/>\n\nHepworth was also a skilled draughtsman. After her daughter Sarah was hospitalised in 1944, she struck up a close friendship with the surgeon Norman Capener.<ref name=\"pallant2012\">{{cite web|title=Barbara Hepworth: The Hospital Drawings 27th November 2012|url=http://pallant.org.uk/about1/press-office/press-releases/2012/barbara-hepworth-hospital-drawings|website=pallant.org.uk|publisher=Pallant House Gallery|accessdate=11 February 2016}}</ref> At Capener's invitation, she was invited to view surgical procedures and, between 1947\u20131949, she produced nearly eighty drawings of operating rooms in chalk, ink, and pencil.<ref name=\"pallant2012\"/><ref name=\"hepburn2013\">{{Cite book| publisher = Tate| isbn = 978-1-84976-165-9| last = Hepburn| first = Nathaniel| title = Barbara Hepworth: The Hospital Drawings| location = New York, NY| date = 3 September 2013}}</ref> Hepworth was fascinated by the similarities between surgeons and artists, stating: \"There is, it seems to me, a close affinity between the work and approach of both physicians and surgeons, and painters and sculptors.\"<ref name=\"pallant2012\"/>\n\nIn 1950, works by Hepworth were exhibited in the British Pavilion at the XXV [[Venice Biennale]]<ref name=bio/> alongside works by [[Matthew Smith (painter)|Matthew Smith]] and [[John Constable]].<ref name=british/> The 1950 Biennale was the last time that contemporary British artists were exhibited alongside artists from the past.<ref name=british/> Two early public commissions, ''[[Contrapunctal Forms (sculpture)|Contrapunctal Forms]]'' and ''[[Turning Forms]]'', were exhibited at the [[Festival of Britain]] in 1951.\n\nDuring this period, Hepworth and Nicholson divorced (1951).<ref name=riggs/>. Hepworth moved away from working only in stone or wood and began to work with bronze and clay.<ref name=tate/> Hepworth often used her garden in St Ives, which she designed with her friend the composer [[Priaulx Rainier]], to view her large-scale bronzes.<ref name=tate/>\n\n====Death of son Paul====\nHer eldest son, Paul, was killed on 13 February 1953 in a plane crash while serving with the [[Royal Air Force]] in Thailand.<ref name=stephens/> A memorial to him, ''Madonna and Child'', is in the [[St Ia's Church, St Ives|parish church of St Ives]].<ref name=bio1/>\n\nExhausted, in part from her son's death, Hepworth travelled to Greece with her good friend [[Margaret Gardiner (artist)|Margaret Gardiner]] in August 1954.<ref name=stephens/> They visited [[Athens]], [[Delphi]], and many of the [[Aegean Islands]].<ref name=stephens/>\n\nWhen Hepworth returned to St Ives from Greece in August 1954, she found that Gardiner had sent her a large shipment of Nigerian [[guarea]] hardwood.<ref name = stephens/> Although she received only a single tree trunk, Hepworth noted that the shipment from Nigeria to the Tilbury docks came in at 17 tons.<ref name = stephens/> Between 1954\u20131956 Hepworth sculpted six pieces out of guarea wood, many of which were inspired by her trip to Greece, such as \"Corinthos\" (1954) and \"Curved Form (Delphi)\" (1955).<ref name = stephens/>\n\n===Ambivalent Burden of International Reputation===\nIt was also during this decade that Hepworth sought to establish a market base for her work in the [[United States]]. Initially she hoped to follow Henry Moore's successful sale of artwork via [[Curt Valentin]] of Bucholz Gallery in New York. Negotiations with Valentin did result in a number of American sales. But despite the sales, and despite interventions by Hepworth's friends, Valentin rebuffed repeated requests to hold any substantial stock of her work. It was not until 1955, after the Martha Jackson Gallery had offered Hepworth the opportunity to exhibit in their space alongside works by [[William Scott (artist)|William Scott]] and [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], that Hepworth formalized gallery representation in the new world.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Roberts |first1=Emma |title=Representation and Reputation: Barbara Hepworth\u2019s Relationships with her American and British Dealers |url=https://www.tate.org.uk/research/publications/tate-papers/20/representation-and-reputation-barbara-hepworths-relationships-with-her-american-and-british-dealers|journal=Tate Papers 20, Autumn 2013|publisher=Tate Gallery |location=London |ISSN= 1753-9854 |date=2013}}</ref>\n\nHepworth's difficulties in establishing a stable gallery relationship in the United States have been attributed to many factors, including the artist's own diffidence regarding personal promotion of her work. When Martha Jackson failed to arrange the solo American exhibition of sculptures and drawings that Hepworth demanded, Hepworth moved, in 1957, to [[Galerie Chalette]], run by Arthur and Madeleine Lejwa, known for their close relationship with [[Jean Arp]], and dedication to close relationships with their artists.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://artdaily.cc/news/108881/Christie-s-announces-selections-from-the-Israel-Museum-to-benefit-the-acquisitions-fund | title=Christie's announces selections from the Israel Museum to benefit the acquisitions fund | publisher=Art Daily | date=2018 | accessdate=March 21, 2020 }}</ref> The Lejwas came through with the solo exhibition Hepworth craved.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Roberts |first1=Emma |title=Representation and Reputation: Barbara Hepworth\u2019s Relationships with her American and British Dealers |url=https://www.tate.org.uk/research/publications/tate-papers/20/representation-and-reputation-barbara-hepworths-relationships-with-her-american-and-british-dealers|journal=Tate Papers 20, Autumn 2013|publisher=Tate Gallery |location=London |ISSN= 1753-9854 |date=2013}}</ref> Hepworth came to New York for the opening (her first visit to the city),<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bowness |first1=Sophie |title=Barbara Hepworth Chronology |url=https://barbarahepworth.org.uk/biography/ |publisher=Hepworth Estate}}</ref>, but made minimal contact with the press and left as soon as possible. \"Have seen all the press,\" she wrote, \"pulled faces at the camera and generally done my best!\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Roberts |first1=Emma |title=Representation and Reputation: Barbara Hepworth\u2019s Relationships with her American and British Dealers |url=https://www.tate.org.uk/research/publications/tate-papers/20/representation-and-reputation-barbara-hepworths-relationships-with-her-american-and-british-dealers|journal=Tate Papers 20, Autumn 2013|publisher=Tate Gallery |location=London |ISSN= 1753-9854 |date=2013}}</ref>.

The first totalisators were introduced about this time. They faced opposition from a curious alliance of bookmakers and anti-gambling factions but were approved by the Clubs and licensed by the Colonial Secretary. The first trotting race on a racecourse in Canterbury, in 1875, before the totalisator was introduced, the stake was only about a \"tenner\" (\u00a310), but the match created a lot of interest. About 1880, Lower Heathcote Racing Club was founded, supporting gallops, but added trotting events to its programme, giving smaller stakes. Some years later the club discontinued gallops and became the Lower Heathcote Trotting Club, which gave stakes ranging from \u00a315 to \u00a335.<ref name=\"addington\" />\n\nThe New South Wales bred, [[Lawn Derby]], racing un-hoppled, was the first pacer to break the two-minute barrier in Australia or New Zealand when he recorded 1:59.4 at the Addington track in New Zealand in 1938.<ref>[http://www.brisbaneracing.com.au/article.php?current_article=2571 Brisbane racing: Did you know these harness racing facts?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015060102/http://brisbaneracing.com.au/article.php?current_article=2571 |date=2009-10-15 }} Retrieved 2010-7-18</ref> \n\nFrom these early stages, the sport has developed with top races and top horses from then right up to the present day.\n\n== Major New Zealand harness races ==\n[[Image:Uncle Petrika (harness racing-trotter).jpg|thumb|200px|right|NZ trotter Uncle Petrika]]\nIn [[New Zealand]] the richest and most important race is the [[New Zealand Trotting Cup]], run for older pacers in November at Addington. Other major races include the [[Auckland Trotting Cup]] as well as the [[Noel J Taylor Memorial Mile]] and the [[New Zealand Messenger Championship]] for four-year-olds. There are also the [[New Zealand Derby (harness)|New Zealand Derby]] and the [[Great Northern Derby (harness)|Great Northern Derby]] for three-year-olds, and the [[Dominion Handicap]] and [[Rowe Cup]] for trotters. The Harness Jewels raceday (the end-of year championships for two-, three- and four-year-olds) takes place in late May or early June\n\nA marquee event is the annual series which takes place between [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]] called the [[Inter Dominion]]. The series, which includes a pacing series and a trotting series, is held yearly and rotated around the Australian State Controlling Bodies and once every four years the [[Inter Dominion]] Championships are held in New Zealand.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"  width=\"670px\"\n|+ List of major harness races in New Zealand\n|-\n|}\n{| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\"

differs from [[North America]]n racing in that [[Metric system|metric]] distances are used, generally above the equivalent of one mile and horses are classed by how many wins they have. Another large difference is that in [[New Zealand]] racing the leader does not have to hand up the lead to any horse that challenges, often leaving a horse parked outside the leader in the \"death seat\", \"the death\", or \"facing the breeze\", as this horse covers more ground than the leader. New Zealand racing generally has more horses in each race, a field of 12 or 13 is not uncommon. This generally means that with the smaller tracks a \"three wide train\" starts as the field gets the bell at signal their final lap. There is a system of an 'open lane' or 'passing lane' ('sprint lane' in Australia). These lanes do not operate on all tracks and have been a point of argument between many industry participants. Many horses are able to easily \"cross the [[Tasman Sea|Tasman]]\" to Australia, as the rules are similar.\n\n== United States and Canada ==\nThe association with trotting in New Zealand and the United States has always been strong, with much of the breeding stock coming from America. Particularly in the 1950s and 1960s, New Zealand horses competed in both Canada and the United States. The first New Zealand horse to be raced in America by a New Zealander was the trotter Vodka, the winner of the 1953 [[Dominion Handicap]]. He was taken there in 1956 by his owner, J. S. Shaw, won 11 races and was later leased to American interests.\n\nIn 1960 [[Caduceus (horse)|Caduceus]] was the first New Zealand pacer to compete in the [[Yonkers Raceway|Yonkers International Series]] with his trainer-driver, J. D. Litten. Despite his nine years, Caduceus showed he was the equal of the top American horses, winning the last race of the series, only to be disqualified. He also was leased to American interests and at 10 years of age was still winning races.\n\n[[False Step]] was driven in the Yonkers International series during the 1960\u201361 season by his trainer [[C C Devine]]. False Step's performances showed he was one of the greatest pacers in the world. He beat the acknowledged American champion, [[Adios Butler]], in a 1\u00bd mile race. He was sold in America for 115,000 dollars, the fifth highest price paid for a pacer in the United States. \n\nArania also entered the series with False Step. She did not do well, but after being leased won several races and proved she was able to race with the best in America, and in fact created a record of 1 min 57 sec for 1 mile in the Lexington Red Mile.<ref>[http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/R/RacingTrotting/NewZealandHorsesInAmerica/en New Zealand Horses in America]</ref>\n\nIn 1964, [[Cardigan Bay (horse)|Cardigan Bay]] was to travel to America with reinsman [[Stanley Dancer]], who paid 100,000 dollars for the horse. Cardigan Bay was already an established racehorse in New Zealand, having won the 1963 [[New Zealand Trotting Cup]] and other top races in Australia and New Zealand. He went on to win over a million dollars in the United States, the first harness horse ever to do so.\n\n\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Harness racing]]\n*[[Harness racing in Australia]]\n*[[Horse racing]]\n*[[Glossary of Australian and New Zealand punting]]\n*[[Thoroughbred racing in New Zealand]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons cat|Horse racing in New Zealand}}\n*[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/racing-trotting/1 ''Racing, Trotting'', from An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand]\n\n{{Oceania topic|Harness racing in}}\n{{Sport in New Zealand}}\n\n[[Category:Harness racing in New Zealand|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|equestrian sport}}\n'''Harness racing in New Zealand''' is more often called '''trotting''' in the \"old school\"  rather than the more fashionable name of \"harness racing\".<ref>[http://www.addington.co.nz/Timeline.asp?Case=6&ItemId=6&AlphaId=4&CategoryId=3 Trotting in New Zealand with reinsman C C Devine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018073231/http://www.addington.co.nz/Timeline.asp?Case=6&ItemId=6&AlphaId=4&CategoryId=3 |date=2008-10-18 }}</ref> The sport is long standing with events being held as early as 1864.

The first totalisators were introduced about this time. They faced opposition from a curious alliance of bookmakers and anti-gambling factions but were approved by the Clubs and licensed by the Colonial Secretary. The first trotting race on a racecourse in Canterbury, in 1875, before the totalisator was introduced, the stake was only about a \"tenner\" (\u00a310), but the match created a lot of interest. About 1880, Lower Heathcote Racing Club was founded, supporting gallops, but added trotting events to its programme, giving smaller stakes. Some years later the club discontinued gallops and became the Lower Heathcote Trotting Club, which gave stakes ranging from \u00a315 to \u00a335.<ref name=\"addington\" />\n\nThe New South Wales bred, [[Lawn Derby]], racing un-hoppled, was the first pacer to break the two-minute barrier in Australia or New Zealand when he recorded 1:59.4 at the Addington track in New Zealand in 1938.<ref>[http://www.brisbaneracing.com.au/article.php?current_article=2571 Brisbane racing: Did you know these harness racing facts?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015060102/http://brisbaneracing.com.au/article.php?current_article=2571 |date=2009-10-15 }} Retrieved 2010-7-18</ref> \n\nFrom these early stages, the sport has developed with top races and top horses from then right up to the present day.\n\n== Major New Zealand harness races ==\n[[Image:Uncle Petrika (harness racing-trotter).jpg|thumb|200px|right|NZ trotter Uncle Petrika]]\nIn [[New Zealand]] the richest and most important race is the [[New Zealand Trotting Cup]], run for older pacers in November at Addington. Other major races include the [[Auckland Trotting Cup]] as well as the [[Noel J Taylor Memorial Mile]] and the [[New Zealand Messenger Championship]] for four-year-olds. There are also the [[New Zealand Derby (harness)|New Zealand Derby]] and the [[Great Northern Derby (harness)|Great Northern Derby]] for three-year-olds, and the [[Dominion Handicap]] and [[Rowe Cup]] for trotters. The Harness Jewels raceday (the end-of year championships for two-, three- and four-year-olds) takes place in late May or early June\n\nA marquee event is the annual series which takes place between [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]] called the [[Inter Dominion]]. The series, which includes a pacing series and a trotting series, is held yearly and rotated around the Australian State Controlling Bodies and once every four years the [[Inter Dominion]] Championships are held in New Zealand.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"  width=\"670px\"\n|+ List of harness races in New Zealand\n|-\n|}\n{| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\"

differs from [[North America]]n racing in that [[Metric system|metric]] distances are used, generally above the equivalent of one mile and horses are classed by how many wins they have. Another large difference is that in [[New Zealand]] racing the leader does not have to hand up the lead to any horse that challenges, often leaving a horse parked outside the leader in the \"death seat\", \"the death\", or \"facing the breeze\", as this horse covers more ground than the leader. New Zealand racing generally has more horses in each race, a field of 12 or 13 is not uncommon. This generally means that with the smaller tracks a \"three wide train\" starts as the field gets the bell at signal their final lap. There is a system of an 'open lane' or 'passing lane' ('sprint lane' in Australia). These lanes do not operate on all tracks and have been a point of argument between many industry participants. Many horses are able to easily \"cross the [[Tasman Sea|Tasman]]\" to Australia, as the rules are similar.\n\n== United States and Canada ==\nThe association with trotting in New Zealand and the United States has always been strong, with much of the breeding stock coming from America. Particularly in the 1950s and 1960s, New Zealand horses competed in both Canada and the United States. The first New Zealand horse to be raced in America by a New Zealander was the trotter Vodka, the winner of the 1953 [[Dominion Handicap]]. He was taken there in 1956 by his owner, J. S. Shaw, won 11 races and was later leased to American interests.\n\nIn 1960 [[Caduceus (horse)|Caduceus]] was the first New Zealand pacer to compete in the [[Yonkers Raceway|Yonkers International Series]] with his trainer-driver, J. D. Litten. Despite his nine years, Caduceus showed he was the equal of the top American horses, winning the last race of the series, only to be disqualified. He also was leased to American interests and at 10 years of age was still winning races.\n\n[[False Step]] was driven in the Yonkers International series during the 1960\u201361 season by his trainer [[C C Devine]]. False Step's performances showed he was one of the greatest pacers in the world. He beat the acknowledged American champion, [[Adios Butler]], in a 1\u00bd mile race. He was sold in America for 115,000 dollars, the fifth highest price paid for a pacer in the United States. \n\nArania also entered the series with False Step. She did not do well, but after being leased won several races and proved she was able to race with the best in America, and in fact created a record of 1 min 57 sec for 1 mile in the Lexington Red Mile.<ref>[http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/R/RacingTrotting/NewZealandHorsesInAmerica/en New Zealand Horses in America]</ref>\n\nIn 1964, [[Cardigan Bay (horse)|Cardigan Bay]] was to travel to America with reinsman [[Stanley Dancer]], who paid 100,000 dollars for the horse. Cardigan Bay was already an established racehorse in New Zealand, having won the 1963 [[New Zealand Trotting Cup]] and other top races in Australia and New Zealand. He went on to win over a million dollars in the United States, the first harness horse ever to do so.\n\n\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Harness racing]]\n*[[Harness racing in Australia]]\n*[[Horse racing]]\n*[[Glossary of Australian and New Zealand punting]]\n*[[Thoroughbred racing in New Zealand]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons cat|Horse racing in New Zealand}}\n*[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/racing-trotting/1 ''Racing, Trotting'', from An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand]\n\n{{Oceania topic|Harness racing in}}\n{{Sport in New Zealand}}\n\n[[Category:Harness racing in New Zealand|*]]\n", "name_user": "ToddyOC", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMajor New Zealand harness races", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harness_racing_in_New_Zealand"}

{"title_page": "Paulino Bernal", "text_new": "{{BLP sources|date=January 2012}}\n\n'''Paulino Bernal''' (born June 22, 1939) is an [[accordion]] player and [[Christians|Christian]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]]. He was a member of the Tejano Tex-Mex group Conjunto Bernal.<ref>http://www.galegroup.com/free_resources/chh/bio/bernal.htm</ref>\n\nIn 1972, Paulino converted from the [[apostolic succession|apostolic]] Christian denomination of [[Catholicism]] to Evangelical Protestantism and founded Bernal Christian Records in order to evangelize his Protestant Christian beliefs. Through his La Nuevo Cristiana ministry, Bernal currently owns and operates more than a dozen [[Spanish Language]] [[religious radio]] stations located in [[Texas]] carrying a satellite-fed programming schedule. In 2008 Paulino Bernal released a new CD of polkas produced by [[Grammy]]-winning producer [[Armando Lichtenberger Jr.]], \"El Maestro Del Acordeon Y Sus Polkas\" on [[Urbana Records]] and received his first Grammy Nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Polka Album|Best Polka Album]] for the 51st Annual Grammys.<ref>http://www.governor.state.tx.us/divisions/music/directory/radio/radio.south.htm</ref>\n\nThe best of the [[conjunto]]s is, beyond a doubt, El Conjunto Bernal. Described by connoisseurs of conjunto music as \"the only one of its kind\" and \"twenty years ahead of its time\" El Conjunto Bernal is well known for its tremendous range of innovations. Its musical experiments spanned the gamut of conjunto, from the traditional polka to Latin music such as the bolero, cha cha cha, and even American rock and roll. El Conjunto Bernal owed much of its originality and meteoric rise to fame to the genius of its founder, Paulino Bernal.\n\n==Early life==\nPaulino Bernal was born June 22, 1939, in [[Raymondville, Texas|Raymondville]], Texas. Reared in the grinding poverty that was experienced by most Chicanos of his generation, Paulino was forced to give up schooling when he was in the [[seventh grade]]. An accomplished [[accordion]]ist by that time, he left school  \"to try and earn money and get us out of the poverty in which we found ourselves.\" Bernal\u2019s mother was a [[divorcee]], and early on she moved to [[Kingsville, Texas|Kingsville]], Texas, where Paulino, his older brother Eloy, the younger Luis, and three sisters were all forced to pick [[cotton]], [[cucumber]]s, and other crops to help support the [[family]]. One day a man came by the house selling a [[guitar]], and Mrs. Bernal \"with great [[sacrifice]],\" bought it for the boys. Paulino soon learned enough to play the [[cantinas]] with an elderly accordionist, where he picked up tips to help buy food for the Bernal family. But Paulino's future lay with the accordion. He remembers hearing the best accordionists of the late 1940s and early 1950s on the radio \u2013 Narciso Martinez, Valerio Longoria, [[Tony de la Rosa (Tejano musician)|Tony De La Rosa]] \u2013 all of whom were recording for the largest Mexican-American company at the time, [[Ideal Records]]. Paulino dreamed of joining their ranks, and when a friend of his was given an accordion as a gift, it was Paulino who spent the most time practising on it. Shortly afterwards, during a trip to visit his [[father]] in Rio Grande Valley, Eloy was given a [[bajo sexto]] by him and the Bernal\u2019s were soon on\ntrack toward their future.\n\nLos Hermanitos Bernal launched their musical career in 1952. They were hired to play a dance in nearby [[Premont, Texas|Premont]] \u2013 Paulino on accordion, Eloy on bajo sexto, and a friend, Adan Lomas, on [[drums]]. According to Bernal, \"a lot of people attended, and they liked the Bernal Brothers so much, they kept calling us back.\" They began playing in [[Falfurrias, Texas|Falfurrias]] and in [[Alice, Texas|Alice]] nearby, the home of  Ideal Records. Soon the Bernal Brothers came to the attention of [[Armando Marroqu\u00edn]], the man who recorded all the artists for Ideal Records.\n\nThe Bernal Brothers were first recorded as the backup [[conjunto]] for some of the [[duet]]s then popular among Texas-Mexicans, such as [[Carmen y Laura]]. In March 1955, Marroquin gave the Bernals their chance as [[Headliner (performances)|headliner]]s, and a [[78 rpm record]] was released with the [[cancion ranchera]] [[Mujer Paseada]] on one side and the romantic [[bolero]] Desprecio on the other. With the release of their first record, the Bernal Brothers quickly put their cotton picking days behind them forever and soon joined [[Valerio Longoria]] and [[Tony De La Rosa (Tejano musician)|Tony De La Rosa]] as the top conjuntos in Texas.\n\nEl Conjunto Bernal recorded prolifically for Ideal between 1955 and 1960 and some of the best sides including the monster hits: [[Mi Unico Camino]] and [[Sentimiento Y Renco]], both from late 1958, are on this CD and cassette.\n\nMarroquin began taking them on tours throughout the southwest and beyond where they always played for packed houses. They were especially popular in [[Arizona]] where local bandleader [[Pedro Bugarin]] was fond of featuring them with his [[orchestra]]. In fact, according to Paulino, he and Eloy used to sit in with Bugarin\u2019s band, and some of the [[band musician]]s would in turn sit in with El Conjunto Bernal.

He was a member of the Tejano Tex-Mex group Conjunto Bernal.<ref>http://www.galegroup.com/free_resources/chh/bio/bernal.htm</ref>\n\nIn 1972, Paulino converted from the [[apostolic succession|apostolic]] Christian denomination of [[Catholicism]] to Evangelical Protestantism and founded Bernal Christian Records in order to evangelize his Protestant Christian beliefs. Through his La Nuevo Cristiana ministry, Bernal currently owns and operates more than a dozen [[Spanish Language]] [[religious radio]] stations located in [[Texas]] carrying a satellite-fed programming schedule. In 2008 Paulino Bernal released a new CD of polkas produced by [[Grammy]]-winning producer [[Armando Lichtenberger Jr.]], \"El Maestro Del Acordeon Y Sus Polkas\" on [[Urbana Records]] and received his first Grammy Nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Polka Album|Best Polka Album]] for the 51st Annual Grammys.<ref>http://www.governor.state.tx.us/divisions/music/directory/radio/radio.south.htm</ref>\n\nThe best of the [[conjunto]]s is, beyond a doubt, El Conjunto Bernal. Described by connoisseurs of conjunto music as \"the only one of its kind\" and \"twenty years ahead of its time\" El Conjunto Bernal is well known for its tremendous range of innovations. Its musical experiments spanned the gamut of conjunto, from the traditional polka to Latin music such as the bolero, cha cha cha, and even American rock and roll. El Conjunto Bernal owed much of its originality and meteoric rise to fame to the genius of its founder, Paulino Bernal.\n\n==Early life==\nPaulino Bernal was born June 22, 1939, in [[Raymondville, Texas|Raymondville]], Texas. Reared in the grinding poverty that was experienced by most Chicanos of his generation, Paulino was forced to give up schooling when he was in the [[seventh grade]]. An accomplished [[accordion]]ist by that time, he left school  \"to try and earn money and get us out of the poverty in which we found ourselves.\" Bernal\u2019s mother was a [[divorcee]], and early on she moved to [[Kingsville, Texas|Kingsville]], Texas, where Paulino, his older brother Eloy, the younger Luis, and three sisters were all forced to pick [[cotton]], [[cucumber]]s, and other crops to help support the [[family]]. One day a man came by the house selling a [[guitar]], and Mrs. Bernal \"with great [[sacrifice]],\" bought it for the boys. Paulino soon learned enough to play the [[cantinas]] with an elderly accordionist, where he picked up tips to help buy food for the Bernal family. But Paulino's future lay with the accordion. He remembers hearing the best accordionists of the late 1940s and early 1950s on the radio \u2013 Narciso Martinez, Valerio Longoria, [[Tony de la Rosa (Tejano musician)|Tony De La Rosa]] \u2013 all of whom were recording for the largest Mexican-American company at the time, [[Ideal Records]]. Paulino dreamed of joining their ranks, and when a friend of his was given an accordion as a gift, it was Paulino who spent the most time practising on it. Shortly afterwards, during a trip to visit his [[father]] in Rio Grande Valley, Eloy was given a [[bajo sexto]] by him and the Bernal\u2019s were soon on\ntrack toward their future.\n\nLos Hermanitos Bernal launched their musical career in 1952. They were hired to play a dance in nearby [[Premont, Texas|Premont]] \u2013 Paulino on accordion, Eloy on bajo sexto, and a friend, Adan Lomas, on [[drums]]. According to Bernal, \"a lot of people attended, and they liked the Bernal Brothers so much, they kept calling us back.\" They began playing in [[Falfurrias, Texas|Falfurrias]] and in [[Alice, Texas|Alice]] nearby, the home of  Ideal Records. Soon the Bernal Brothers came to the attention of [[Armando Marroqu\u00edn]], the man who recorded all the artists for Ideal Records.\n\nThe Bernal Brothers were first recorded as the backup [[conjunto]] for some of the [[duet]]s then popular among Texas-Mexicans, such as [[Carmen y Laura]]. In March 1955, Marroquin gave the Bernals their chance as [[Headliner (performances)|headliner]]s, and a [[78 rpm record]] was released with the [[cancion ranchera]] [[Mujer Paseada]] on one side and the romantic [[bolero]] Desprecio on the other. With the release of their first record, the Bernal Brothers quickly put their cotton picking days behind them forever and soon joined [[Valerio Longoria]] and [[Tony De La Rosa (Tejano musician)|Tony De La Rosa]] as the top conjuntos in Texas.\n\nEl Conjunto Bernal recorded prolifically for Ideal between 1955 and 1960 and some of the best sides including the monster hits: [[Mi Unico Camino]] and [[Sentimiento Y Renco]], both from late 1958, are on this CD and cassette.\n\nMarroquin began taking them on tours throughout the southwest and beyond where they always played for packed houses. They were especially popular in [[Arizona]] where local bandleader [[Pedro Bugarin]] was fond of featuring them with his [[orchestra]]. In fact, according to Paulino, he and Eloy used to sit in with Bugarin\u2019s band, and some of the [[band musician]]s would in turn sit in with El Conjunto Bernal. This exposure to band music inspired Paulino to branch out of the normally simple [[ranchera]] music of the conjunto into the more sophisticated style of the [[orquesta]].\n\nWhen Armando Marroquin ended his relationship with Ideal Records around 1960, El Conjunto Bernal stayed with him and recorded for his new label, Nopal Records. Shortly thereafter, Conjunto Bernal relocated to McAllen, Texas, across the border from Mexico in the Lower Rio Grande Valley.

Alberta is located in the [[Geography of North America|northwestern quadrant]] of [[North America]], in a region of low [[population density]] called the [[Interior Plains]]. Alberta is [[landlocked]], and separated by [[Western Cordillera (North America)|a series of mountain ranges]] from the nearest [[List of North American ports#Canada 5|outlets]] to the [[British Columbia Coast|Pacific Ocean]], and by the [[Canadian Shield]] from ports on [[Thunder Bay|the Lakehead]] or [[Hudson Bay]]. From these ports to major populations centres and markets in Europe or Asia is several thousands of kilometers. The largest population clusters of North America (the [[Northeast megalopolis|Boston&nbsp;\u2013 Washington]], [[California megapolitan areas|San Francisco - San Diego]], [[Great Lakes Megalopolis|Chicago&nbsp;\u2013 Pittsburgh]], and [[Quebec City&nbsp;\u2013 Windsor Corridor]]s) are all thousands of kilometers away from Alberta. Partly for this reason, Alberta has never developed a large presence in the industries that have traditionally started [[industrialization]] in other places (notably the original [[Industrial Revolution]] in Great Britain) but which require large [[labour force]]s, and large internal markets or easy transportation to export markets, namely [[Textile manufacturing|textiles]], [[metallurgy]], or transportation-related manufacturing ([[automotive manufacturing|automotives]], [[ship building|ships]], or [[List of locomotive builders|train cars]]).\n\n[[Agriculture in Canada|Agriculture]] has been a key industry since the 1870s. The climate is dry, [[temperate]], and [[continental climate|continental]], with extreme variations between seasons. Productive soils are found in most of the southern half of the province (excluding the mountains), and in certain parts of the north. Agriculture on a large scale is practiced further north in Alberta than anywhere else in North America, extending into the [[Peace River country]] above the [[55th parallel north]]. Generally, however, [[northern Alberta]] (and areas along the [[Alberta Rockies]]) is forested land and [[logging]] is more important than agriculture there. Agriculture is divided into primarily [[field crops]] in the east, [[livestock]] in the west, and a mixture in between and in the [[Aspen parkland|parkland belt]] in the near north.\n\nConventional oil and gas fields are found throughout the province on an axis running from the northwest to the southeast. Oil sands are found in the northeast, especially around [[Fort McMurray]] (the [[Athabasca Oil Sands]]).\n\nBecause of its (relatively) economically isolated location, Alberta relies heavily on [[transportation in Alberta|transportation links]] with the rest of the world. Alberta's historical development has been largely influenced by the development of new [[transportation infrastructure]], (see \"trends\" below). Alberta is now served by two major [[transcontinental railways]] ([[Canadian National Railway|CN]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CP]]), by three major highway connections to the Pacific (the [[Trans-Canada (highway)|Trans-Canada]] via [[Kicking Horse Pass]], the [[Yellowhead (highway)|Yellowhead]] via [[Yellowhead Pass]] and the [[Crowsnest (highway)|Crowsnest]] via [[Crowsnest Pass]]), and one to the United States ([[Interstate 15]]), as well as two international airports ([[Calgary International Airport|Calgary]] and [[Edmonton International Airport|Edmonton]]). Also, Alberta is connected to the [[TransCanada pipeline|TransCanada pipeline system]] (natural gas) to Eastern Canada, the [[Northern Border Pipeline]] (gas), [[Alliance Pipeline]] (gas) and [[Enbridge Pipeline System]] (oil) to the Eastern United States, the [[Gas Transmission Northwest]] and [[Northwest Pipeline]] (gas) to the Western United States, and the [[McNeill HVDC Back-to-back station]] (electric power) to Saskatchewan.\n\n{{Economy of Canada}}\n\n=== Economic regions and cities ===\nSince the days of early agricultural settlement, the majority of Alberta's population has been concentrated in the [[parkland belt]] (mixed forest-grassland), a boomerang-shaped strip of land extending along the [[North Saskatchewan River]] from Lloydminster to Edmonton and then along the [[Rocky Mountain foothills]] south to Calgary. This area is slightly more humid and treed than the drier [[prairie]] (grassland) region called [[Palliser's Triangle]] to its south, and large areas of the south (the \"[[Special Areas, Alberta|Special Areas]]\") were [[depopulated]] during the [[drought]]s of the 1920s and 30s. The [[chernozem]] (black soil) of the parkland region is more agriculturally productive than the red and grey soils to the south. Urban development has also been most advanced in the parkland belt. Edmonton and Red Deer are parkland cities, while Calgary is on the parkland-prairie fringe. Lethbridge and Medicine Hat are prairie cities. Grande Prairie lies in the [[Peace River Country]] a parkland region (with isolated patches of prairie, hence the name) in the northwest isolated from the rest of the parkland by the forested [[Swan Hills]]. [[Fort McMurray]] is the only urbanized population centre in the [[boreal forest of Canada|boreal forest]] which covers much of the northern half of the province.\n\n==== Calgary and Edmonton ====\nThe Calgary and Edmonton regions, by far the province's two largest metropolitan regions, account for the majority of the province's population. They are relatively close to each other by the standards of Western Canada and distant from other metropolitan regions such as Vancouver or Winnipeg. This has produced a history of political and economic rivalry and comparison but also economic integration that has created an urbanized corridor between the two cities.\n\nThe economic profile of the two regions is slightly different. Both cities are mature service economies built on a base of resource extraction in their hinterlands. However, Calgary is predominant in hosting the regional and national headquarters of oil and gas exploration and drilling companies. Edmonton skews much more towards governments, universities and hospitals as large employers, while Edmonton's suburban fringes (e.g. [[Fort Saskatchewan]], [[Nisku, Alberta|Nisku]], [[Strathcona County]] ([[Refinery Row (Edmonton)|Refinery Row]]), [[Leduc, Alberta|Leduc]], [[Beaumont, Alberta|Beaumont]], [[Acheson, Alberta|Acheson]]) are home to most of the province's manufacturing (much of it related to oil and gas).<ref name=\"edmontonjournal_Lamphier_20161210\">{{Cite news| last = Lamphier| first = Gary| newspaper = Edmonton Journal |title=It's a wrap, folks: thanks for a great run | access-date = September 5, 2019| date = December 10, 2016| url = https://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/columnists/gary-lamphier-its-a-wrap-folks-thanks-for-a-great-run}}</ref>\n\n===== Calgary-Edmonton Corridor =====\nThe [[Calgary-Edmonton Corridor]] is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in Canada. Measured from north to south, the region covers a distance of roughly {{convert|400|km}}. In 2001, the population of the Calgary-Edmonton Corridor was 2.15 million (72% of Alberta's population).<ref name=\"CECorridor\">{{cite web|url=http://geodepot.statcan.ca/Diss/Highlights/Page9/Page9d_e.cfm|title=Calgary-Edmonton corridor|work=[[Statistics Canada]], 2001 Census of Population|date=2003-01-20|accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref> It is also one of the fastest-growing regions in the country. A 2003 study by [[TD Bank Financial Group]] found the corridor was the only Canadian urban centre to amass a U.S. level of wealth while maintaining a Canadian-style quality of life, offering universal health care benefits. The study found GDP per capita in the corridor was 10% above average U.S. metropolitan areas and 40% above other Canadian cities at that time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\n===== Calgary\u2013Edmonton rivalry =====\n{{See also|Battle of Alberta}}\nSeeing Calgary and Edmonton as part of a single economic region as the TD study did in 2003 was novel. The more traditional view had been to see the two cities as economic rivals. For example, in the 1980 both cities claimed to be the \"Oil Capital of Canada\".\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Leduc oil.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Leduc No. 1]] well, which blew in 1947, marked the beginning of series of petroleum-related [[economic booms]].]]\n{{See also|History of Alberta|History of the petroleum industry in Canada}}\n\nAlberta has always been an [[export-oriented economy]]. In line with [[Harold Innis]]' \"[[Staples Thesis]]\", the economy has changed substantially as different export commodities have risen or fallen in importance. In sequence, the most important products have been: fur, wheat and beef, and oil and gas.\n\nThe development of [[transportation in Alberta]] has been crucial to its historical economic development. The [[North American fur trade]] relied on [[birch-bark canoes]], [[York boats]], and [[Red River carts]] on [[buffalo trails]] to move furs out of, and European trade goods into, the region. Immigration into the province was eased tremendously by the arrival of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]'s [[transcontinental line]] in 1880s. Commercial farming became viable in the area once the [[grain trade]] had developed technologies to handle the [[bulk cargo|bulk]] export of grain, especially [[hopper car]]s and [[grain elevator]]s. Oil and gas exports have been possible because of increasing [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] technology.\n\nPrior to the 1950s, Alberta was a primarily agricultural economy, based on the export of [[grain trade|wheat]], [[beef]], and a few other [[Commodity|commodities]]. The health of economy was closely bound up with the [[price of wheat]].\n\nIn 1947 a major [[oil field]] was discovered near Edmonton. It was not the first petroleum find in Alberta, but it was large enough to significantly alter the economy of the province (and coincided with growing American demand for energy). Since that time, Alberta's economic fortunes have largely tracked the [[price of oil]], and increasingly [[natural gas prices]]. When oil prices spiked during the [[1967 Oil Embargo]], [[1973 oil crisis]], and [[1979 energy crisis]], Alberta's economy boomed. However, during the [[1980s oil glut]] Alberta's economy suffered. Alberta boomed once again during the [[2003 to 2008 world oil market chronology|2003-2008 oil price spike]]. In July 2008 the price of oil peaked and began to decline and Alberta's economy soon followed suit, with unemployment doubling within a year. By 2009 with natural gas prices at a long-term low, Alberta's economy was in poor health compared to before, although still relatively better than many other comparable jurisdictions. By 2012 natural gas prices were at a ten-year low, the Canadian dollar was high, and oil prices recovered until June 2014.\n\nThe spin-offs from petroleum allowed Alberta to develop many other industries.

In both [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]] and [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], world class [[polyethylene]] and [[Vinyl group|vinyl]] manufacturers produce products shipped all over the world, and Edmonton's [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] provide the raw materials for a large [[petrochemical industry]] to the east of Edmonton. Since the early 1940s, Alberta had supplied oil and gas to the rest of Canada and the [[United States]]. The [[Athabasca River]] region produces oil for internal and external use. The [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] contain the largest proven reserves of oil in the world outside [[Saudi Arabia]].\n\nThe [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] (sometimes known as the Athabasca [[Tar sands]]) have estimated [[unconventional oil]] reserves approximately equal to the [[conventional oil]] reserves of the rest of the world, estimated to be {{convert|1.6|Toilbbl}}. With the development of new extraction methods such as [[steam assisted gravity drainage]] (SAGD), which was developed in Alberta, bitumen and synthetic crude oil can be produced at costs close to those of conventional crude. Many companies employ both conventional [[surface mining|strip mining]] and non-conventional [[in situ]] methods to extract the [[bitumen]] from the oil sands. With current technology and at current prices, about {{convert|315|Goilbbl}} of bitumen are recoverable. [[Fort McMurray]], one of Canada's fastest growing cities, has grown enormously in recent years because of the large corporations which have taken on the task of oil production. As of late 2006 there were over $100 billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern Alberta.\n\nAnother factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands was the price of oil. The [[oil price increases since 2003]] made it more than profitable to extract this oil, which in the past would give little profit or even a loss.\n\nAlberta's economy was negatively impacted by the [[2016 oil glut|2015-2016 oil glut]] with a record high volume of worldwide oil [[inventory|inventories]] in storage,<ref name=\"Firzli\"/> with global crude oil collapsing at near ten-year low prices.<ref name=\"G&M_Deloitte_2016\"/><ref name=\"reuters_2016_Feb16\"/><ref name=\"fortune_2016\"/> The United States doubled its 2008 production levels mainly due to substantial improvements in [[tight oil|shale]] \"[[fracking]]\" technology, OPEC members consistently exceeded their production ceiling, and China experienced a marked slowdown in economic growth and crude oil imports.<ref name=\"G&M_Deloitte_2016\"/><ref name=\"reuters_2016_Feb16\"/><ref name=\"fortune_2016\"/><ref name=\"NYT_2014\">{{cite news |title=U.S. Oil Prices Fall Below $80 a Barrel |first=Clifford |last=Krassnov |date=November 3, 2014 |accessdate=December 13, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/business/energy-environment/us-oil-prices-fall-below-80-a-barrel.html |newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref><ref name=glut>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-04/opec-maintains-crude-production-as-group-defers-output-target-ihryzilb |title=OPEC Won't Cut Production to Stop Oil's Slump |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=4 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nMining and Oil and Gas Extraction Industry (2017)<ref name=\"GOV_AB_Profile_Extraction_2018\">{{cite report |series=Industry Profiles 2018 |title=Mining and Oil and Gas Extraction Industry |url=https://work.alberta.ca/documents/industry-profile-mining-oil-and-gas-extraction.pdf |date=February 2018 |isbn=978-1-4601-3781-9 |issn= 2292-8960 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190909194936/https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/f5a3586b-9fad-47a5-8741-e46cf5008d16/resource/9b026daf-1045-49bb-aad6-34996db59914/download/industry-profile-mining-oil-and-gas-extraction.pdf |archivedate=September 9, 2019 }}</ref>\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! \n!Alberta\n!Mining and Oil and Gas Extraction Industry \n|-\n|Employment ||2,286,900 ||140,300 \n|-\n|Employment Share ||N/A ||6.1% \n|-\n|Unemployment ||194,700 ||8,800 \n|-\n|Unemployment rate ||7.8% ||5.9%\n|} \n*Data Source: Statistics Canada, Labour Force Survey, CANSIM Table 282\u20130008, 2017 \"Employment share is obtained by dividing the number of employment in this industry by total employment in Alberta.\"<ref name=\"GOV_AB_Profile_Extraction_2018\"/>\n\n====Natural gas====\n[[Natural gas]] has been found at several points, and in 1999, the production of natural gas liquids ([[ethane]], [[propane]], and [[butane]]s) totalled {{convert|172.8|Moilbbl}}, valued at $2.27 billion.

Currently Alberta produces cattle valued at over $3.3 billion, as well as other livestock in lesser quantities. In this region [[irrigation]] is widely used. [[Wheat]], accounting for almost half of the $2 billion agricultural economy, is supplemented by [[canola]], [[barley]], [[rye]], [[sugar beets]], and other [[mixed farming]]. In 2011, Alberta producers seeded an estimated total of {{convert|17900000000|acres}} to [[spring wheat]], [[durum]], barley, oats, [[mixed grains]], [[triticale]], canola and [[dry peas]]. Of the total seeded area, 94 per cent was harvested as grains and [[oilseeds]] and six per cent as [[greenfeed]] and [[silage]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/sdd14009 |title=Alberta 2011 Greenfeed and Silage Production Survey Results |date=2011 |work=Department of Agriculture, Government of Alberta}}</ref>\n\n[[Agriculture]] has a significant position in the province's economy.

Nearly one half of all Canadian beef is produced in Alberta. Alberta is one of the prime producers of plains [[American Bison|buffalo (bison)]] for the consumer market. [[domestic sheep|Sheep]] for [[wool]] and [[Lamb (food)|lamb]] are also [[sheep farm|raised]].\n\n[[Wheat]] and [[canola]] are primary farm crops, with Alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production, with other [[cereal|grains]] also prominent. Much of the farming is dryland farming, often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation. Continuous cropping (in which there is no fallow season) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion. Across the province, the once common [[grain elevator]] is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreased and farmers now truck the grain to central points.\n\nAlberta is the leading [[beekeeping]] province of Canada, with some beekeepers wintering [[Beehive (beekeeping)|hive]]s indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta, then migrating north during the summer into the [[Peace River (Alberta)|Peace River]] valley where the season is short but the working days are long for [[Western honey bee|honeybee]]s to produce honey from [[clover]] and [[fireweed]]. [[Hybrid (biology)|Hybrid]] [[canola]] also requires [[bee]] [[pollination]], and some beekeepers service this need.\n\n==== Forestry ====\n{{see also|Pulp and paper industry in Canada|Alberta Forest Products Association}}\n\nThe vast northern [[forest]] reserves of [[softwood]] allow Alberta to produce large quantities of [[lumber]], [[Oriented strand board|oriented strand board (OSB)]] and [[plywood]], and several plants in northern Alberta supply North America and the [[Pacific Rim]] [[nation]]s with bleached [[wood pulp]] and [[newsprint]].\n\nIn 1999, [[lumber]] products from Alberta were valued at $4.1 billion of which 72% were exported around the world. Since forests cover approximately 59% of the province's land area, the government allows about {{convert|23.3|e6m3}} to be harvested annually from the forests on public lands.\n\n===Services===\nDespite the high profile of the extractive industries, Alberta has a mature economy and most people work in services. In 2014 there were 1,635.8 thousand people employed in the services-producing sector. Since then, the number has steadily increased to 1754.8 thousand jobs by August 2019, which is an increase of 16.7 thousand jobs from August 2018<ref name=\"statcan_2016_services\">{{cite web|url=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410035501|title=Employment by industry, monthly, seasonally adjusted (x 1,000)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=September 26, 2019}}</ref> This includes wholesale and retail trade; transportation and warehousing; finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing; professional, scientific and technical services; business, building and other support services; educational services; health care and social assistance; information, culture and recreation; accommodation and food services; other services (except public administration) and public administration.<ref name=\"statcan_2016_services\" />\n\n====Finance====\nThe [[TSX Venture Exchange]] is headquartered in Calgary, and Calgary also has a robust service industry relating to the [[Security (finance)|securities]] market.

Alberta is located in the [[Geography of North America|northwestern quadrant]] of [[North America]], in a region of low [[population density]] called the [[Interior Plains]]. Alberta is [[landlocked]], and separated by [[Western Cordillera (North America)|a series of mountain ranges]] from the nearest [[List of North American ports#Canada 5|outlets]] to the [[British Columbia Coast|Pacific Ocean]], and by the [[Canadian Shield]] from ports on [[Thunder Bay|the Lakehead]] or [[Hudson Bay]]. From these ports to major populations centres and markets in Europe or Asia is several thousands of kilometers. The largest population clusters of North America (the [[Northeast megalopolis|Boston&nbsp;\u2013 Washington]], [[California megapolitan areas|San Francisco - San Diego]], [[Great Lakes Megalopolis|Chicago&nbsp;\u2013 Pittsburgh]], and [[Quebec City&nbsp;\u2013 Windsor Corridor]]s) are all thousands of kilometers away from Alberta. Partly for this reason, Alberta has never developed a large presence in the industries that have traditionally started [[industrialization]] in other places (notably the original [[Industrial Revolution]] in Great Britain) but which require large [[labour force]]s, and large internal markets or easy transportation to export markets, namely [[Textile manufacturing|textiles]], [[metallurgy]], or transportation-related manufacturing ([[automotive manufacturing|automotives]], [[ship building|ships]], or [[List of locomotive builders|train cars]]).\n\n[[Agriculture in Canada|Agriculture]] has been a key industry since the 1870s. The climate is dry, [[temperate]], and [[continental climate|continental]], with extreme variations between seasons. Productive soils are found in most of the southern half of the province (excluding the mountains), and in certain parts of the north. Agriculture on a large scale is practiced further north in Alberta than anywhere else in North America, extending into the [[Peace River country]] above the [[55th parallel north]]. Generally, however, [[northern Alberta]] (and areas along the [[Alberta Rockies]]) is forested land and [[logging]] is more important than agriculture there. Agriculture is divided into primarily [[field crops]] in the east, [[livestock]] in the west, and a mixture in between and in the [[Aspen parkland|parkland belt]] in the near north.\n\nConventional oil and gas fields are found throughout the province on an axis running from the northwest to the southeast. Oil sands are found in the northeast, especially around [[Fort McMurray]] (the [[Athabasca Oil Sands]]).\n\nBecause of its (relatively) economically isolated location, Alberta relies heavily on [[transportation in Alberta|transportation links]] with the rest of the world. Alberta's historical development has been largely influenced by the development of new [[transportation infrastructure]], (see \"trends\" below). Alberta is now served by two major [[transcontinental railways]] ([[Canadian National Railway|CN]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CP]]), by three major highway connections to the Pacific (the [[Trans-Canada (highway)|Trans-Canada]] via [[Kicking Horse Pass]], the [[Yellowhead (highway)|Yellowhead]] via [[Yellowhead Pass]] and the [[Crowsnest (highway)|Crowsnest]] via [[Crowsnest Pass]]), and one to the United States ([[Interstate 15]]), as well as two international airports ([[Calgary International Airport|Calgary]] and [[Edmonton International Airport|Edmonton]]). Also, Alberta is connected to the [[TransCanada pipeline|TransCanada pipeline system]] (natural gas) to Eastern Canada, the [[Northern Border Pipeline]] (gas), [[Alliance Pipeline]] (gas) and [[Enbridge Pipeline System]] (oil) to the Eastern United States, the [[Gas Transmission Northwest]] and [[Northwest Pipeline]] (gas) to the Western United States, and the [[McNeill HVDC Back-to-back station]] (electric power) to Saskatchewan.\n\n{{Economy of Canada}}\n\n=== Economic regions and cities ===\nSince the days of early agricultural settlement, the majority of Alberta's population has been concentrated in the [[parkland belt]] (mixed forest-grassland), a boomerang-shaped strip of land extending along the [[North Saskatchewan River]] from Lloydminster to Edmonton and then along the [[Rocky Mountain foothills]] south to Calgary. This area is slightly more humid and treed than the drier [[prairie]] (grassland) region called [[Palliser's Triangle]] to its south, and large areas of the south (the \"[[Special Areas, Alberta|Special Areas]]\") were [[depopulated]] during the [[drought]]s of the 1920s and 30s. The [[chernozem]] (black soil) of the parkland region is more agriculturally productive than the red and grey soils to the south. Urban development has also been most advanced in the parkland belt. Edmonton and Red Deer are parkland cities, while Calgary is on the parkland-prairie fringe. Lethbridge and Medicine Hat are prairie cities. Grande Prairie lies in the [[Peace River Country]] a parkland region (with isolated patches of prairie, hence the name) in the northwest isolated from the rest of the parkland by the forested [[Swan Hills]]. [[Fort McMurray]] is the only urbanized population centre in the [[boreal forest of Canada|boreal forest]] which covers much of the northern half of the province.\n\n==== Calgary and Edmonton ====\nThe Calgary and Edmonton regions, by far the province's two largest metropolitan regions, account for the majority of the province's population. They are relatively close to each other by the standards of Western Canada and distant from other metropolitan regions such as Vancouver or Winnipeg. This has produced a history of political and economic rivalry and comparison but also economic integration that has created an urbanized corridor between the two cities.\n\nThe economic profile of the two regions is slightly different. Both cities are mature service economies built on a base of resource extraction in their hinterlands. However, Calgary is predominant in hosting the regional and national headquarters of oil and gas exploration and drilling companies. Edmonton skews much more towards governments, universities and hospitals as large employers, while Edmonton's suburban fringes (e.g. [[Fort Saskatchewan]], [[Nisku, Alberta|Nisku]], [[Strathcona County]] ([[Refinery Row (Edmonton)|Refinery Row]]), [[Leduc, Alberta|Leduc]], [[Beaumont, Alberta|Beaumont]], [[Acheson, Alberta|Acheson]]) are home to most of the province's manufacturing (much of it related to oil and gas).<ref name=\"edmontonjournal_Lamphier_20161210\">{{Cite news| last = Lamphier| first = Gary| newspaper = Edmonton Journal |title=It's a wrap, folks: thanks for a great run | access-date = September 5, 2019| date = December 10, 2016| url = https://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/columnists/gary-lamphier-its-a-wrap-folks-thanks-for-a-great-run}}</ref>\n\n===== Calgary-Edmonton Corridor =====\nThe [[Calgary-Edmonton Corridor]] is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in Canada. Measured from north to south, the region covers a distance of roughly {{convert|400|km}}. In 2001, the population of the Calgary-Edmonton Corridor was 2.15 million (72% of Alberta's population).<ref name=\"CECorridor\">{{cite web|url=http://geodepot.statcan.ca/Diss/Highlights/Page9/Page9d_e.cfm|title=Calgary-Edmonton corridor|work=[[Statistics Canada]], 2001 Census of Population|date=2003-01-20|accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref> It is also one of the fastest-growing regions in the country. A 2003 study by [[TD Bank Financial Group]] found the corridor was the only Canadian urban centre to amass a U.S. level of wealth while maintaining a Canadian-style quality of life, offering universal health care benefits. The study found GDP per capita in the corridor was 10% above average U.S. metropolitan areas and 40% above other Canadian cities at that time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\n===== Calgary\u2013Edmonton rivalry =====\n{{See also|Battle of Alberta}}\nSeeing Calgary and Edmonton as part of a single economic region as the TD study did in 2003 was novel. The more traditional view had been to see the two cities as economic rivals. For example, in the 1980 both cities claimed to be the \"Oil Capital of Canada\".\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Leduc oil.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Leduc No. 1]] well, which blew in 1947, marked the beginning of series of petroleum-related [[economic booms]].]]\n{{See also|History of Alberta|History of the petroleum industry in Canada}}\n\nAlberta has always been an [[export-oriented economy]]. In line with [[Harold Innis]]' \"[[Staples Thesis]]\", the economy has changed substantially as different export commodities have risen or fallen in importance. In sequence, the most important products have been: fur, wheat and beef, and oil and gas.\n\nThe development of [[transportation in Alberta]] has been crucial to its historical economic development. The [[North American fur trade]] relied on [[birch-bark canoes]], [[York boats]], and [[Red River carts]] on [[buffalo trails]] to move furs out of, and European trade goods into, the region. Immigration into the province was eased tremendously by the arrival of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]'s [[transcontinental line]] in 1880s. Commercial farming became viable in the area once the [[grain trade]] had developed technologies to handle the [[bulk cargo|bulk]] export of grain, especially [[hopper car]]s and [[grain elevator]]s. Oil and gas exports have been possible because of increasing [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] technology.\n\nPrior to the 1950s, Alberta was a primarily agricultural economy, based on the export of [[grain trade|wheat]], [[beef]], and a few other [[Commodity|commodities]]. The health of economy was closely bound up with the [[price of wheat]].\n\nIn 1947 a major [[oil field]] was discovered near Edmonton. It was not the first petroleum find in Alberta, but it was large enough to significantly alter the economy of the province (and coincided with growing American demand for energy). Since that time, Alberta's economic fortunes have largely tracked the [[price of oil]], and increasingly [[natural gas prices]]. When oil prices spiked during the [[1967 Oil Embargo]], [[1973 oil crisis]], and [[1979 energy crisis]], Alberta's economy boomed. However, during the [[1980s oil glut]] Alberta's economy suffered. Alberta boomed once again during the [[2003 to 2008 world oil market chronology|2003-2008 oil price spike]]. In July 2008 the price of oil peaked and began to decline and Alberta's economy soon followed suit, with unemployment doubling within a year. By 2009 with natural gas prices at a long-term low, Alberta's economy was in poor health compared to before, although still relatively better than many other comparable jurisdictions. By 2012 natural gas prices were at a ten-year low, the Canadian dollar was high, and oil prices recovered until June 2014.\n\nThe spin-offs from petroleum allowed Alberta to develop many other industries. Oilpatch-related manufacturing is an obvious example, but financial services and government services have also benefited from oil money.\n\nA comparison of the development of Alberta's less oil and gas-endowed neighbours, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, reveals the role petroleum has played. Alberta was once the smallest of the three [[Prairie Provinces]] by population in the early 20th century, but by 2009, Alberta's population was 3,632,483 or approximately three times as much as either Saskatchewan (1,023,810) or Manitoba (1,213,815).\n\n==Employment==\nAlberta's economy is a highly developed one in which most people work in services such as healthcare, government, or retail.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Job market trends and profiles |work=Alberta| access-date = September 9, 2019| date = 2018| url = https://www.alberta.ca/job-market-trends-profiles.aspx | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190909182248/https://www.alberta.ca/job-market-trends-profiles.aspx | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2019-09-09 }}</ref> Primary industries are also of great importance, however.\n\nBy March 2016 the unemployment rate in Alberta rose to 7.9%\u2014<ref name=\"finance_alberta_2016_mar_11\" /> its \"highest level since April 1995 and the first time the province\u2019s rate has surpassed the national average since December 1988.\"<ref name=\"finance_alberta_about_2016_mar_11\">{{cite web | url=http://www.finance.alberta.ca/aboutalberta/at-a-glance/current-economy-indicators-at-a-glance.pdf | title=Alberta Economy: Indicators at a Glance | publisher=Treasury Board and Finance Economics and Revenue Forecasting | date=March 11, 2016 | accessdate=March 16, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314172259/http://www.finance.alberta.ca/aboutalberta/at-a-glance/current-economy-indicators-at-a-glance.pdf | archive-date=March 14, 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref> There were 21,200 fewer jobs than February 2015.<ref name=\"finance_alberta_2016_mar_11\" /> The unemployment rate was expected to average 7.4% in 2016.<ref name=\"financealberta_2016_Feb\">{{cite report | url=http://finance.alberta.ca/publications/budget/quarterly/2015/2015-16-3rd-Quarter-Fiscal-Update.pdf#page=12 | title=2015\u201316 Third Quarter Fiscal Update and Economic Statement | publisher=Department of Finance, Government of Alberta | date=February 2016 | accessdate=16 March 2016 |location=Edmonton, Alberta |pages=15}}</ref>{{rp|13}} The [[Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers]] (CAPP) claimed that Alberta lost 35,000 jobs in 2015\u201325,000 from the oil services sector and 10,000 from exploration and production.<ref name=\"huffington_2015\">{{citation |title=Alberta Oilpatch Layoffs Total 35,000, Says CAPP |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/09/02/alberta-oilpatch-layoffs_n_8078660.html |work=The Huffington Post|location=Alberta |first=Michelle |last=Butterfield |date=September 2, 2015 |accessdate=March 16, 2016}}</ref> Full-time employment increased by 10,000 in February 2016 after falling 20,000 in both December 2015 and January 2016.

In both [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]] and [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], world class [[polyethylene]] and [[Vinyl group|vinyl]] manufacturers produce products shipped all over the world, and Edmonton's [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] provide the raw materials for a large [[petrochemical industry]] to the east of Edmonton. Since the early 1940s, Alberta had supplied oil and gas to the rest of Canada and the [[United States]]. The [[Athabasca River]] region produces oil for internal and external use. The [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] contain the largest proven reserves of oil in the world outside [[Saudi Arabia]].\n\nThe [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] (sometimes known as the Athabasca [[Tar sands]]) have estimated [[unconventional oil]] reserves approximately equal to the [[conventional oil]] reserves of the rest of the world, estimated to be {{convert|1.6|Toilbbl}}. With the development of new extraction methods such as [[steam assisted gravity drainage]] (SAGD), which was developed in Alberta, bitumen and synthetic crude oil can be produced at costs close to those of conventional crude. Many companies employ both conventional [[surface mining|strip mining]] and non-conventional [[in situ]] methods to extract the [[bitumen]] from the oil sands. With current technology and at current prices, about {{convert|315|Goilbbl}} of bitumen are recoverable. [[Fort McMurray]], one of Canada's fastest growing cities, has grown enormously in recent years because of the large corporations which have taken on the task of oil production. As of late 2006 there were over $100 billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern Alberta.\n\nAnother factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands was the price of oil. The [[oil price increases since 2003]] made it more than profitable to extract this oil, which in the past would give little profit or even a loss.\n\nAlberta's economy was negatively impacted by the [[2016 oil glut|2015-2016 oil glut]] with a record high volume of worldwide oil [[inventory|inventories]] in storage,<ref name=\"Firzli\"/> with global crude oil collapsing at near ten-year low prices.<ref name=\"G&M_Deloitte_2016\"/><ref name=\"reuters_2016_Feb16\"/><ref name=\"fortune_2016\"/> The United States doubled its 2008 production levels mainly due to substantial improvements in [[tight oil|shale]] \"[[fracking]]\" technology, OPEC members consistently exceeded their production ceiling, and China experienced a marked slowdown in economic growth and crude oil imports.<ref name=\"G&M_Deloitte_2016\"/><ref name=\"reuters_2016_Feb16\"/><ref name=\"fortune_2016\"/><ref name=\"NYT_2014\">{{cite news |title=U.S. Oil Prices Fall Below $80 a Barrel |first=Clifford |last=Krassnov |date=November 3, 2014 |accessdate=December 13, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/business/energy-environment/us-oil-prices-fall-below-80-a-barrel.html |newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref><ref name=glut>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-04/opec-maintains-crude-production-as-group-defers-output-target-ihryzilb |title=OPEC Won't Cut Production to Stop Oil's Slump |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=4 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nMining and Oil and Gas Extraction Industry (2017)<ref name=\"GOV_AB_Profile_Extraction_2018\">{{cite report |series=Industry Profiles 2018 |title=Mining and Oil and Gas Extraction Industry |url=https://work.alberta.ca/documents/industry-profile-mining-oil-and-gas-extraction.pdf |date=February 2018 |isbn=978-1-4601-3781-9 |issn= 2292-8960 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190909194936/https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/f5a3586b-9fad-47a5-8741-e46cf5008d16/resource/9b026daf-1045-49bb-aad6-34996db59914/download/industry-profile-mining-oil-and-gas-extraction.pdf |archivedate=September 9, 2019 }}</ref>\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! \n!Alberta\n!Mining and Oil and Gas Extraction Industry \n|-\n|Employment ||2,286,900 ||140,300 \n|-\n|Employment Share ||N/A ||6.1% \n|-\n|Unemployment ||194,700 ||8,800 \n|-\n|Unemployment rate ||7.8% ||5.9%\n|} \n*Data Source: Statistics Canada, Labour Force Survey, CANSIM Table 282\u20130008, 2017 \"Employment share is obtained by dividing the number of employment in this industry by total employment in Alberta.\"<ref name=\"GOV_AB_Profile_Extraction_2018\"/>\n\n====Natural gas====\n[[Natural gas]] has been found at several points, and in 1999, the production of natural gas liquids ([[ethane]], [[propane]], and [[butane]]s) totalled {{convert|172.8|Moilbbl}}, valued at $2.27 billion.

Currently Alberta produces cattle valued at over $3.3 billion, as well as other livestock in lesser quantities. In this region [[irrigation]] is widely used. [[Wheat]], accounting for almost half of the $2 billion agricultural economy, is supplemented by [[canola]], [[barley]], [[rye]], [[sugar beets]], and other [[mixed farming]]. In 2011, Alberta producers seeded an estimated total of {{convert|17900000000|acres}} to [[spring wheat]], [[durum]], barley, oats, [[mixed grains]], [[triticale]], canola and [[dry peas]]. Of the total seeded area, 94 per cent was harvested as grains and [[oilseeds]] and six per cent as [[greenfeed]] and [[silage]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/sdd14009 |title=Alberta 2011 Greenfeed and Silage Production Survey Results |date=2011 |work=Department of Agriculture, Government of Alberta}}</ref>\n\n[[Agriculture]] has a significant position in the province's economy. Over three million [[cattle]] are residents of the province at one time or another,<ref>{{citation |url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/rsb11006 |title=Alberta Livestock Inspections |date=August 2006 |work=Department of Agriculture, Government of Alberta |access-date=2007-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815131438/http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/rsb11006 |archive-date=2011-08-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and Albertan beef has a healthy worldwide market. Nearly one half of all Canadian beef is produced in Alberta. Alberta is one of the prime producers of plains [[American Bison|buffalo (bison)]] for the consumer market. [[domestic sheep|Sheep]] for [[wool]] and [[Lamb (food)|lamb]] are also [[sheep farm|raised]].\n\n[[Wheat]] and [[canola]] are primary farm crops, with Alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production, with other [[cereal|grains]] also prominent. Much of the farming is dryland farming, often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation. Continuous cropping (in which there is no fallow season) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion. Across the province, the once common [[grain elevator]] is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreased and farmers now truck the grain to central points.\n\nAlberta is the leading [[beekeeping]] province of Canada, with some beekeepers wintering [[Beehive (beekeeping)|hive]]s indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta, then migrating north during the summer into the [[Peace River (Alberta)|Peace River]] valley where the season is short but the working days are long for [[Western honey bee|honeybee]]s to produce honey from [[clover]] and [[fireweed]]. [[Hybrid (biology)|Hybrid]] [[canola]] also requires [[bee]] [[pollination]], and some beekeepers service this need.\n\n==== Forestry ====\n{{see also|Pulp and paper industry in Canada|Alberta Forest Products Association}}\n\nThe vast northern [[forest]] reserves of [[softwood]] allow Alberta to produce large quantities of [[lumber]], [[Oriented strand board|oriented strand board (OSB)]] and [[plywood]], and several plants in northern Alberta supply North America and the [[Pacific Rim]] [[nation]]s with bleached [[wood pulp]] and [[newsprint]].\n\nIn 1999, [[lumber]] products from Alberta were valued at $4.1 billion of which 72% were exported around the world. Since forests cover approximately 59% of the province's land area, the government allows about {{convert|23.3|e6m3}} to be harvested annually from the forests on public lands.\n\n===Services===\nDespite the high profile of the extractive industries, Alberta has a mature economy and most people work in services. In 2014 there were 1,635.8 thousand people employed in the services-producing sector. Since then, the number has steadily increased to 1754.8 thousand jobs by August 2019, which is an increase of 16.7 thousand jobs from August 2018<ref name=\"statcan_2016_services\">{{cite web|url=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410035501|title=Employment by industry, monthly, seasonally adjusted (x 1,000)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=September 26, 2019}}</ref> This includes wholesale and retail trade; transportation and warehousing; finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing; professional, scientific and technical services; business, building and other support services; educational services; health care and social assistance; information, culture and recreation; accommodation and food services; other services (except public administration) and public administration.<ref name=\"statcan_2016_services\" />\n\n====Finance====\nThe [[TSX Venture Exchange]] is headquartered in Calgary, and Calgary also has a robust service industry relating to the [[Security (finance)|securities]] market. The city has the second highest number of corporate head offices in Canada after Toronto, and the financial services industry in Calgary has developed to support them.\n\nEdmonton hosts the headquarters of the only major Canadian banks west of Toronto: [[Canadian Western Bank]], and [[ATB Financial]], as well as the only province-wide [[credit union]], [[Servus]].\n\n====Government====\nDespite Alberta's reputation as a \"small government\" province, many health care and education professionals are lured to Alberta from other provinces by the higher wages the Alberta government is able to offer because of oil revenues. In 2014 the median household income in Alberta was $100,000 with the average weekly wage at $1,163\u201423 per cent higher than the Canadian national average.<ref name=\"CBC_2015_wages\">{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/alberta-wages-almost-25-higher-than-canadian-average-1.2981768 | title=Alberta wages almost 25% higher than Canadian average: Economists, politicians and business leaders seek ways to bring wages down | publisher=CBC | date=March 5, 2015 | accessdate=March 16, 2016 | author=Johnson, Tracy}}</ref>\n\nIn their May 2018 report co-authored by [[C.

These instructions incorporated most of the plantations and developments of Virginia into four boroughs or cities. These cities were [[Charles City (Virginia Company)|Charles City]], [[Elizabeth City (Virginia Company)|Elizabeth City]], Henrico City, and [[James City (Virginia Company)|James City]]. The latter included the seat of government for the colony at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]]. Each of the four cities extended across the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]], the main conduit of transportation of the era.\n\nIn 1634, under Royal authority, a portion became Henrico Shire, later [[Henrico County, Virginia]].<ref name= Hening1809/> The [[county seat]] was designated near [[John Rolfe]] and [[Pocahontas]]' former home [[Varina Farms]] and remained there until 1752, when a new courthouse was built in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].\n\nHenrico's first major settlement was in 1611 at the fortified town of [[Henricus]] on what is now known as [[Farrar's Island]],<ref name=Surface1907/> near the location of the [[Dutch Gap Canal]] today. Sir [[Thomas Dale]]'s was abandoned during the [[Indian Massacre of 1622]], as were the [[Falling Creek Ironworks]]. However, the offshoot town of Henrico, as differentiated from the adjacent, defunct fort, would survive until 1786, its courthouse having been burned by [[Benedict Arnold]] in 1781, during the 1776 revolution. Both locations were recently rediscovered and are now located in [[Chesterfield County, Virginia|Chesterfield County]], which was formed from parts of Henrico before the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name= Hening1809>{{cite book|chapter=Acts made at the Grand Assembly Holden at James {{not a typo|Citty}}, The 21st Aug, 1633|title= The Statutes at Large; Being a Collection of All the Laws of Virginia, from the First Session of the Legislature, in the year 1619.

Up to the Season 3 finale, Draper was [[creative director]] of fictional [[Manhattan]] [[advertising firm]] Sterling Cooper. He then became a founding partner at a new firm, Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, after he and his superiors left their previous agency in advance of an unwanted acquisition. The agency later [[mergers and acquisitions|merged]] with a rival firm, Cutler Gleason & Chaough, to become Sterling Cooper & Partners while pursuing a contract from [[Chevrolet]].\n\nThe character of Don Draper is partially inspired by Draper Daniels, a creative director at [[Leo Burnett Worldwide|Leo Burnett advertising agency]] in [[Chicago]] in the 1950s, who worked on the [[Marlboro Man]] campaign.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Myra Janco |last=Daniels|title=I Married a Mad Man|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/August-2009/I-Married-a-Mad-Man/|magazine=[[Chicago (magazine)|Chicago]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=August 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801085117/http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/August-2009/I-Married-a-Mad-Man/|archivedate=August 1, 2010|accessdate=April 8, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Character biography ==\n=== Early life ===\nDonald Francis Draper is revealed through flashbacks to be the assumed identity of <!-- PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS NAME, THE CHARACTER'S BIRTH NAME IS RICHARD WHITMAN, THIS HAS BEEN CITED AND VERIFIED.

His mother died in labor, and his father was killed from a kick by a spooked horse, an accident a 10-year-old Dick witnessed.\n\nDick was raised primarily by Archie's second wife Abigail (Brynn Horrocks), who treated him with cruelty because she saw his very existence as a reminder of her husband's infidelity. She had a son named Adam, who was Dick's half-brother. The one person to show him any kindness as a child was \"Uncle Mack,\" ([[Morgan Rusler]]) who taught him how to survive in the real world. Mack was \"with\" Abigail's sister and ran the brothel where Dick and Adam grew up after leaving the family farm. Many years later, Dick recalled one of his few exposures to the outside world was the story of [[Milton Hershey]] and his school for orphaned children, and wondered why he failed to qualify for such a place considering both his parents were deceased, which made him think he was forgotten. One of the prostitutes had Dick and Adam pickpocket coins from trousers while she was turning tricks, to which the boys would be paid in the form of Hershey bars. Don recalls eating these as the closest he ever got to a \"normal childhood\".\n\nDuring this period of his life, he began to suffer from [[croup]] and was left under the care of a prostitute named Aim\u00e9e ([[Megan Ferguson]]).

A seriously wounded Whitman switches Draper's dog tags with his own before passing out. He later awakens in a U.S. Army field hospital, presumed to be Lieutenant Draper, and is awarded the [[Purple Heart]]. He is sent home on a train with Lieutenant Draper's coffin (believed to be Private Whitman's) to offer the Army's regrets to Whitman's survivors. He avoids meeting the Whitmans at the train station but is spotted by Adam ([[Jay Paulson]]), whose parents fail to recognize him. Years later Adam tracks his half-brother down in New York, but \"Draper\" insists on leaving the past behind and coldly rejects him, paying him off with a check for $5,000 to keep the [[identity theft]] secret. Years later, Dick learned Adam took this so hard he hung himself. \n\nWhitman begins his life anew as Don Draper, working as a used-car salesman. [[List of Mad Men characters#Anna Draper|Anna M. Draper]] ([[Melinda Page Hamilton]]), widow of the real Don Draper, tracks him down. He informs her of Don's death and confesses to his masquerade. The two form a close bond that continues for many years. Anna remains a close friend and confidante until her death from [[bone cancer]] in 1965.\n\n=== Life as \"Don Draper\" ===\nThe new Don Draper relocates to New York City, where he works as a [[furrier|fur]] salesman and attends [[City College of New York|City College]] at night. With the support of his boss, he writes advertising copy for the fur company, helping him build a portfolio along with some spec ads. It is at this job that Draper meets his future wife, [[Betty Draper|Eizabeth \"Betty\" Hofstadt]] ([[January Jones]]), a model who is photographed for one of his own ads. After a chance meeting at the store, he tricks a drunken [[Roger Sterling]] ([[John Slattery]]) into offering him a job at Sterling Cooper, and eventually becomes its [[Creative director|Creative Director]].\n\nHe is considered a major asset to the company, as he has considerable talent for understanding the desires of others and for effectively pitching and selling ideas. Because of this, he is occasionally courted by other advertising firms. Although he keeps his true character heavily guarded, almost everyone at the firm is portrayed as respecting his talent. At the same time, many in the firm are also troubled by Draper's erratic behavior.\n\n[[Peggy Olson]] ([[Elisabeth Moss]])  begins her career at Sterling Cooper as Draper's secretary, but with her boss' support she becomes a [[copywriter]]. Throughout the series their relationship is portrayed as one of trust and mutual respect, even as Peggy advances in her career and eventually leaves the firm.\n\nDraper and Betty are married in May 1953, and eventually move into a house with an address shown as 42 Bullet Park Road, [[Ossining (village), New York|Ossining]] in [[Westchester County, New York]]. They have two children - Sally ([[Kiernan Shipka]]), born in 1954 or early 1955, and Bobby ([[Maxwell Huckabee]]), born in 1957 or early 1958.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Chrysanthemum and the Sword|series=Mad Men|serieslink=Mad Men|network=[[AC]]{{dn|date=March 2020}}|season=4|number=5|airdate=August 22, 2010|quote=In this episode, Don tells Dr. Faye Miller the ages of his children.

While the new agency (rebranded Sterling Cooper & Partners, SC&P) is successful, at the end of Season 6, he is forced to take \"a leave of absence\" from the new firm because of his erratic behavior, which costs the firm a possible advertising account with [[Hershey Chocolate]].<ref name=\"care\">{{cite episode |title=In Care Of |series=Mad Men |network=AMC |airdate=June 23, 2013 |season=6 |number=13}}</ref>\n\nDraper works as a freelancer for a year while still technically on SC&P's payroll. Megan has moved to Los Angeles to pursue her acting career, and asks him for a divorce. Feeling guilty over his past infidelities, Draper gives her a generous divorce settlement. SC&P eventually allows him to come back on the condition that he stops drinking on the job. He does his work well and eventually assumes his old position with the company. Following Bert Cooper's death, Roger Sterling, with Draper and other partners' support, sells SC&P to McCann as an independent and separate subsidiary. The arrangement lasts for a year before McCann decides to fully absorb SC&P. McCann's executives groom Draper as management material, but he panics at the thought of being tied down and leaves the company in the middle of a meeting.\n\nDraper embarks upon a nomadic existence as a mechanic, and in the series' final episode, \"Person to Person\", moves into a commune with Anna's niece Stephanie ([[Caity Lotz]]). In the last scene of the episode and series, he sits and meditates, with a smile on his face.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Person to Person |series=Mad Men |network=AMC |airdate=May 17, 2015 |season=7 |number=14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Ashley|last=Lee|url=http://time.com/3891861/mad-men-finale-don-draper-jon-hamm-matthew-weiner-coke-ad-recap/|title=Don Draper Wrote That Coke Ad, After All|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=May 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170123160933/http://time.com/3891861/mad-men-finale-don-draper-jon-hamm-matthew-weiner-coke-ad-recap/|archive-date=January 23, 2017|url-status=live|access-date=January 23, 2017}}</ref> His ultimate fate is left ambiguous: in their reviews of the final episode, some critics said that the episode's final shot\u2014the iconic \"[[I'd Like to Buy the World a Coke]]\" ad, produced by McCann Erickson\u2014implied that the episode did not provide a definite ending to Draper's story, while others noted that Peggy's last conversation with Don was a phone call inviting him to work with her on a new client she just landed, Coca-Cola, suggests Draper returned to advertising and created that commercial.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Shirley|last=Li|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/05/18/mad-men-series-finale-reviews-are|title=Here's what everyone wrote about the Mad Men finale|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=May 15, 2015|accessdate=March 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Don Draper and women ==\nDon Draper met his future wife, [[Betty Draper|Betty Hofstadt]], when she was working as a model, later surprising her when he purchased a fur she wore during a photo shoot. With that gesture being the start of their relationship, Betty and Don were soon married. The couple later has their first child, Sally, soon followed by a son, Bobby. In Season 3, the Drapers have another son, Gene, named after Betty's recently deceased father.\n\nDon cheats on his wife repeatedly throughout Seasons 1 and 2. In Season 1, he is involved with Midge Daniels ([[Rosemary DeWitt]]), a [[marijuana|pot]]-smoking artist and [[beatnik]] who works out of a small apartment in [[Greenwich Village]]. Her [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle and friends do not appeal to Don, but their relationship offers him an escape from his high-pressure job and life of responsibilities. When he receives a bonus check of $2,500 from Sterling Cooper, he asks her to vacation with him in [[Paris]]. He changes his mind after realizing Midge is in love with a fellow [[beatnik]], and instead stuffs the check into her blouse, telling her to 'go buy a car' with it. Don doesn't see her again until Season 4, when Midge pretends to inadvertently run into him with the hope of selling a painting to help fund her [[heroin]] addiction. He agrees to visit her apartment but, after learning of her true intentions, somberly purchases a painting and leaves.\n\nDuring and after his affair with Midge, Don pursues [[List of Mad Men characters#Rachel Menken|Rachel Menken]] ([[Maggie Siff]]), the daughter of Abraham Menken, the elderly Jewish founder of the upscale Menken's Department Store. Rachel is educated, sophisticated, and a savvy businesswoman, assisting her father in running the family business. Despite bickering with her during their initial business meetings, Don and she become intimate, and they eventually begin an affair. Their relationship collapses after he professes a desire to run away with her, prompting Rachel to realize Draper simply wants an excuse to run away and forget his responsibilities. She leaves on a cruise to [[Europe]] and marries sometime before the beginning of Season 2.\n\nIn Season 2, Draper has an affair with [[List of Mad Men characters#Jimmy and Bobbie Barrett|Bobbie Barrett]] ([[Melinda McGraw]]), the wife of Jimmy Barrett ([[Patrick Fischler]]), an [[insult comic]] who is filming a commercial for one of Sterling Cooper's clients, [[Utz Quality Foods, Inc.|Utz Potato Chips]]. Don admires her savvy and boldness and the pair enter into a sexualized power struggle. They continue their affair, taking a trip to Bobbie's beach house in [[Stony Brook, New York|Stony Brook]] on [[Long Island]], but their plans are interrupted by a car accident. Arrested for [[drunk driving]] and unable to post bond with the cash on his person, Don reaches out to Peggy, who travels from [[Brooklyn]] to Long Island in the middle of the night to post his bail. Bobbie stays with Peggy until her injuries from the accident heal. The affair between Draper and Bobbie continues until the episode \"Maidenform\", when she lets it slip that his previous mistresses have been talking about his sexual prowess. Because he highly values his privacy, Draper is disgusted that his extramarital escapades are being gossiped about, and immediately ends the affair. He must continue his professional relationship with the Barretts. The Drapers and the Barretts meet at the [[Stork Club]] for a night out. At the end of the evening, Jimmy reveals to Betty that their spouses have had an affair. When Betty confronts him, Draper repeatedly denies the accusations, infuriating her.\n\nThe strain leads to Don and Betty's first separation, and he moves into a hotel room.  His father-in-law has another stroke, necessitating a visit from Dan at the Hofstadt home to keep up the appearance of a happy marriage. In his post-stroke confusion, Hofstadt openly expresses his disdain for his son-in-law, saying, \"He's got no people. You can't trust a man like that.\" Don comforts Betty, who is distraught at her father's decline, and they have sex, leading Don to believe that Betty has forgiven him. When they arrive home, however, Betty tells him not to move back in, saying \"We were only pretending.\"\n\nHis life in flux, Don impulsively decides to join [[Pete Campbell]] on a business trip to [[Los Angeles]]. In California, he meets a mysterious European [[viscount]] with a 21-year-old daughter named Joy ([[Laura Ramsay]]). Despite telling Campbell that the trip is strictly business, Draper joins Joy and her \"jet set\" family of self-described nomads at their lavish vacation home in [[Palm Springs]]. He sleeps with her the same night then leaves Joy the next morning to visit Anna Draper, who convinces him to return home to his wife and family. Later, Draper returns to Ossining and tells Betty he \"wasn't respectful\" to her. Betty reveals she is [[pregnant]].\n\nIn episode 1 of season 3, Don and colleague [[Salvatore Romano]] ([[Bryan Batt]]) go on a business trip to [[Baltimore]]. Don has a one-night-stand with stewardess Shelly ([[Laura Beth Coakley]]), who tells Don she's engaged and that this may be the only chance she has left to dally. He responds: \"I've been married a long time; you get plenty of chances.\"\n\nIn Season 3, Don has an affair lasting several months with his daughter's schoolteacher, [[List of Mad Men characters#Suzanne Farrell|Suzanne Farrell]] ([[Abigail Spencer]]). Their relationship builds slowly over several accidental meetings and conversations laden with innuendo. Don becomes infatuated by Suzanne's optimism and kindness and they finally consummate their relationship in September 1963. On October 30, 1963, he plans a weekend get-away with Suzanne, believing his wife and children are out of town. While Suzanne waits in the car, he enters his house to retrieve a suitcase and is stunned to find Betty at home. She reveals that she's found a key to the locked drawer in Draper's desk and discovered the box of photographs and other evidence of his past life, as well as several hundred dollars in emergency escape funds. Forced to reveal his true identity, Don never returns to the car and Suzanne eventually walks home. Even though they have not been discovered, he calls her the next day to break off the relationship. Draper begins an unsuccessful attempt to save his marriage, but Betty uses his lies about his life and past as an excuse to divorce him in order to marry [[List of Mad Men characters#Henry Francis|Henry Francis]], an aide to New York State governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]].\n\nFollowing the dissolution of his marriage, Don's relationship with women reaches its nadir during Season 4, which takes place from 1964 to 1965. At the beginning of Season 4, set in 1964, he hires a prostitute named Candace ([[Erin Cummings]]) to slap him during sex. Roger Sterling's wife, [[List of Mad Men characters#Jane Sterling (n\u00e9e Siegel)|Jane Sterling]] ([[Peyton List (actress, born 1986)|Peyton List]]), sets Draper up with [[List of Mad Men characters#Bethany Van Nuys|Bethany]] ([[Anna Camp]]), a friend of hers. They go on three dates, but the relationship goes nowhere, as he regards her as sweet and pretty, but interchangeable. After winning at the [[Clio Awards]] and during a weekend of heavy drinking, Draper goes to bed with one woman and blacks out, wakes up with a different woman, and has no recollection of what has happened. He continues to visit the prostitute and pay her, eventually setting Lane Pryce up with the prostitute one night in his apartment. While on a trip to California he visits Anna in [[San Pedro, California|San Pedro]], and attempts to seduce her 18-year-old niece Stephanie. Because she has known Draper since she was a child, she declines and tells him that her aunt has cancer. Later in the season, as Anna is on her deathbed, Draper repeatedly contemplates calling her, but can't bring himself to say goodbye until it's too late.\n\nWhen Draper goes home drunk after an office Christmas party, he forgets the keys to his apartment. He asks [[List of Mad Men characters#Allison|Allison]] ([[Alexa Alemanni]]), his secretary, to deliver the keys to him. Having had a crush on him all along, she retrieves his keys and brings them back to his apartment, where Draper is barely conscious. Instead of leaving his keys and going back to the party, Allison invites herself inside and offers to cook for him.  He refuses and collapses onto his couch. As she begins to leave, Draper makes a pass at her; she returns the attention and has sex with him.<ref>{{cite video|title=Talked About Scene Episode 402 Mad Men: Don's Secretary Does Him a Favor Season 4, Episode 2|date=August 1, 2010|url=http://www.amctv.com/mad-men/videos/mad-men-talked-about-scene-dons-secretary-does-him-a-favor|work=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]}}</ref> This later creates tension in their professional relationship when Draper tries to act as if nothing happened and gives her a large Christmas bonus to make up for her inadvertently hurt feelings. Confused and heartbroken, Allison decides she can no longer work for him or the agency and finds another job. She asks Don to write a letter of recommendation for her; he tells her that she can write it herself and that he will sign off on whatever she writes. Insulted and enraged, she throws a brass cigarette dispenser at him, calls him \"a bad person,\" and storms out in tears. Visibly shaken by the encounter, Draper later attempts to write a letter of apology to her, but then decides to leave it be.\n\nLater in Season 4, Draper becomes friendly with [[List of Mad Men characters#Faye Miller|Dr. Faye Miller]] ([[Cara Buono]]), a [[consumer psychology|consumer psychologist]] he frequently works with. At the beginning of 1965, before the two start dating, she informs him, \"you'll be married by the end of the year.\" After fending off his gentlemanly advances on several occasions, she begins a romantic relationship with him. During an extreme anxiety attack after believing he'd been discovered as the AWOL Dick Whitman, Don reveals his checkered past to Faye. She responds with sympathy and emotional support, and advises he confront the issues in his life and turn himself in. In another episode, Sally suddenly shows up at the agency's offices, and Draper asks Faye to look after his daughter; Faye warns him she is not good with children, is inexperienced around them, and does not have maternal feelings. At the end of the same episode, Sally flees from Draper, runs down the hall, then trips and falls into the arms of Draper's new secretary, [[List of Mad Men characters#Megan Draper|Megan Calvet]], who consoles the child much more effectively than Faye did. Faye feels forced into the situation and gets angry at Draper for asking her to watch his daughter, telling him, \"it felt like a test, and I failed.\"\n\nAs Season 4 progresses, Draper is no longer visiting prostitutes and seems to have settled down with Faye. Although he seems to be satisfied in his relationship with her, he begins to notice and grow close with his secretary, Megan. Draper is surprised when Megan reveals herself to be intelligent, liberal, and eager to learn from him and Peggy about advertising. His business faces a severe hardship that indirectly threatens his and Faye's relationship. Megan seeks to help relieve his tensions and the pair have sex in his office one night; he is ambivalent at first, but she assuredly tells him not to worry because she only wants to have sex with him and she won't make a scene about it. With Faye's consulting firm no longer working with SCDP, she is pleased because she and Draper can now be \"out in the open\" with their relationship.\n\nDuring the Season 4 finale, \"Tomorrowland,\" Faye believes their relationship is stronger than ever. However, when Betty suddenly fires her children's long-time nanny, Draper scrambles to find a nanny for his three children for their upcoming visit to California and, remembering how good Megan was with children previous, asks her to accompany them on the trip. He goes to Anna's house one last time, and Stephanie tells him that Anna left him the diamond solitaire engagement ring given to her by the real Don Draper upon their engagement. Draper ends up sleeping with Megan during the trip and impulsively decides to propose to her with the engagement ring. He tells her the ring is very special to him and that he \"finally feels like himself\" with her. Megan accepts, and upon returning to New York, Draper telephones Faye, an breaks off their relationship by informing her of his engagement. Draper also informs Betty as she is packing up the last moving box from the home they shared together in Ossining.\n\nWhen the fifth season opens, in May 1966, it is revealed that Draper has told Megan all about his past and his real identity. It is also revealed that they married sometime between seasons four and five (between October 1965 and May 1966) and have moved into a penthouse apartment on Park Avenue and 73rd. Over the course of the first year of their, Draper is besotted with Megan and her natural skill at her work. When Megan decides she wants to quit advertising to pursue her dream of being an actress, Draper is initially skeptical and his feelings hurt, but wanting to make her happy, he relents. He remains fearful of her acting career, and they begin to argue more frequently. One of these arguments is over his past relationships, when they encounter one of his former girlfriends, Andrea Rhodes ([[M\u00e4dchen Amick]]). After encountering Rhodes, Don develops a severe fever and leaves work early to lay down. While he is sleeping, he hallucinates that Rhodes enters his apartment and forces herself upon him sexually even as he tries to tell her \"no\". Rhodes describes a scene of the past of them having sex, while Betty is waiting for him around the corner. The fever dream climaxes with Draper \"killing\" her. When he wakes the next morning, fever broken, he is terrified before realizing that it was all just a dream and that Megan has been with him all night, nursing him back to health.\n\nIn the sixth season, sometime before January 1968, Draper begins an affair with his married downstairs neighbor, Sylvia Rosen ([[Linda Cardellini]]). They both feel discontented with their respective marriages and enjoy the thrill and convenience of their secret affair, but struggle to balance feelings of guilt; Draper is friends with Sylvia's husband Arnold ([[Brian Markinson]]) and Sylvia is close with Megan. In June 1968, the two of them engage in a days-long [[BDSM]] sexual role-play game in a Manhattan hotel. After having a dream about the two of them that she saw as an omen, Sylvia ends their affair. When Draper later helps Sylvia's son avoid [[Vietnam War|service in Vietnam]], their affair temporarily resumes until Sally discovers them together.\n\nAs the series ends in season seven, Draper, now divorced a second time, is reminded of Rachel while dealing with a conflict at work. He reaches out to her only to discover that she has died of cancer. Not long after, he runs into Diana Bauer ([[Elizabeth Reaser]]), a waitress who bears a resemblance to Rachel. The two begin an affair, but it comes crashing down when it's revealed Diana is dealing with her past. Draper encourages her to forget it and move on, but she insists that ignoring past hurts is the wrong way to deal with life, and the two go their separate ways.\n\n== Personality ==\n{{Essay-like|date=April 2013}}\nDespite his outward cynicism and egotism, the character of Don Draper demonstrates a strict code of personal [[ethics]], insisting on honesty and [[chivalry]] in his subordinates, but not always in himself. He is protective of his subordinates, admonishing [[Pete Campbell]] in the pilot about his rude remarks to and about [[Peggy Olson]]. Draper is also protective of his colleagues; for example, he berates several subordinates for mocking [[Freddy Rumsen]]'s ([[Joel Murray]]) episode of [[urinary incontinence]], a symptom of Rumsen's [[alcoholism]].<ref>{{cite episode |title=Six Month Leave |series=Mad Men |network=AMC |airdate=September 28, 2008 |season=2 |number=09}}</ref>\n\nDraper adheres to a stricter code of [[business ethics]] than many of his colleagues. A [[Mad Men (season 2)|Season 2]] arc has him upset about being told to drop the smaller local [[Mohawk Airlines]] as a client in hopes of picking up [[American Airlines]]. In [[Mad Men (season 3)|Season 3]], he is hesitant to sign a wealthy client eager to pour his fortune into promoting [[jai alai]], a sport the client thinks will replace [[baseball]] as \"America's game\", which Draper thinks is a doomed enterprise. He is also the only partner to protest a scheme hatched by Pete Campbell and a potential client that involves Joan's sleeping with a [[Jaguar Cars]] executive in order to secure the account.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Other Woman |series=Mad Men |network=AMC |airdate=May 27, 2012 |season=5 |number=11}}</ref> \n\nDraper briefly becomes a confidant to [[art director]] Sal Romano, a [[the closet|closeted]] [[homosexual]] whom Draper finds in a compromising position with another man in a [[Baltimore]] hotel. On their way back to New York, Draper gently lets Romano know he is aware of his homosexuality and couches his comments about their [[London Fog (company)|London Fog]] account artwork to offer him advice about being cautious.<ref name=\"out\">{{cite episode |title=Out of Town |series=Mad Men |network=AMC |airdate=August 6, 2009 |season=3 |number=1}}</ref> Later on, when Romano won't give in to [[Lucky Strike]] executive Lee Garner Jr.'s (Darren Pettie) sexual demands, Garner has him fired.<ref name=\"MadMenEp309\">{{cite episode |title=Wee Small Hours |series=Mad Men |network=AMC |airdate=October 9, 2010 |season=3 |number=09}}</ref> Romano goes to Draper for help, but when he explains what happened, Draper tells him he supports his dismissal, since Lucky Strike is too big a client to lose, and implies that Romano should have given Garner what he wanted. In contrast to the tolerant attitude he had earlier shown his colleague, he regards Romano now with [[homophobia|homophobic]] disdain.<ref name=\"MadMenEp309\" />\n\nWhile the Don Draper character is not color-blind in matters of [[Race (human classification)|race]], he recognizes the [[Civil Rights Movement|changes sweeping the country]] and acknowledges the advertising potential of \"the Negro market\". In the pilot, he is seen asking a black waiter about the waiter's [[cigarette]] preferences. In another episode, he attends a festive [[Kentucky Derby]] party hosted by Roger Sterling and watches with disgust as Sterling serenades his young wife in [[blackface]]. Draper and Pete Campbell seem to be the only guests who disapprove of, or are uncomfortable with, the spectacle.<ref>{{cite episode |title=My Old Kentucky Home |series=Mad Men |network=AMC |airdate=August 30, 2009 |season=3 |number=3}}</ref>\n\nDraper is loyal to many of his coworkers, and is particularly close to Peggy Olson and Joan Harris; they are two of the only women he has ever had a completely platonic relationship with. Draper and Pete Campbell initially dislike one another, as Draper at first sees Pete as the spoiled son of a wealthy \"old money\" New York City family, who received his job because of his family connections rather than professional talent. They eventually grow to respect each other, however, and a work friendship develops.  Draper watches Pete become a smart and driven advertising executive. Draper also has a close relationship with Roger Sterling. They are generally depicted as overlooking each other's personal failings and supporting one another at work. Roger saves a drunken Draper from drowning after the latter falls into a swimming pool while they are attending a party in Hollywood. Meanwhile, Draper inspires Roger to refocus his efforts at SCDP, causing Roger to engineer the firm's acquisition of the Chevrolet account. Roger fights to get Draper reinstated at SCDP after his forced leave of absence.\n\nDraper is occasionally shown to regret how he treats his family. When Betty gives birth to their third child, he has a conversation with another man in the hospital waiting room who says he's going to be a better man for his wife and child.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Fog |series=Mad Men |network=AMC |airdate=September 13, 2009 |season=3 |number=5}}</ref> Although it is implied that Draper has similar convictions, he later acknowledges to his second wife that he feels a general state of disconnect between himself and his children.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Flood |series=Mad Men |network=AMC |airdate=April 28, 2013 |season=6 |number=5}}</ref> Draper's one consistent display of parental behavior is that he cannot tolerate Betty's often harsh treatment of Sally, and he has interceded on her behalf on those occasions.\n\nDraper detests his father-in-law, Eugene \"Gene\" Hofstadt ([[Ryan Cutrona]]), but agrees to take him into their home when Gene is no longer able to live on his own. At multiple points, Draper shows more patience and understanding toward his father-in-law than his wife. After Gene's death, however, Draper tells Betty that he and her father hated each other.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Grown-Ups |series=Mad Men |network=AMC |airdate=November 1, 2009 |season=3 |number=12}}</ref>\n\nLike many other characters in the series Draper is a heavy drinker, with his cocktail of choice being an [[Old Fashioned (cocktail)|Old Fashioned]]. While [[Canadian Club]] is his preferred liquor, bottles of [[Crown Royal]], [[Jameson Irish Whiskey|Jameson]], [[Wild Turkey (bourbon)|Wild Turkey]], [[Smirnoff]], [[Beefeater Gin|Beefeater]], and [[Tanqueray]] can also be seen in his home and office.\n\nThroughout the series, Draper displays signs of [[alcoholism]], which eventually deteriorates to a level of [[alcohol dependency]] that endangers his job. In Season 4, following his divorce from Betty, his drinking reaches a point that he begins experiencing [[Blackout (drug-related amnesia)|alcoholic blackouts]], resulting in his keeping a journal as means of coming to terms with his situation and cutting down on his consumption. By the end of season 6, having battled constantly with his crisis of identity, Draper is forced to take a leave of absence after revealing the truth about his upbringing to the would-be lucrative and prestigious client, [[The Hershey Company|Hershey's]]. His confession is brought on by a pre-presentation round of drinks, and is the concluding incident in a long line of other drinking-related incidents that lead the partners of SC&P to finally take action; they put him on indefinite leave. Draper is hired back during Season 7, with a sobriety clause in his new contract.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Field Trip |series=Mad Men |network=AMC |airdate=April 27, 2014 |season=7 |number=2}}</ref> He violates these terms when he realizes during a conversation regarding new business with Bert Cooper that he is no longer valued as an active player in the agency. The other partners however do not realize this because [[Freddy Rumsen]], who has since achieved sobriety, receives a call from Draper and takes him out of the office under the pretense of seeing a [[New York Mets]] game thereby keeping him away from the office until he sobers up the next morning. By the end of Season 7, Draper has succeeded in curbing his drinking, and has secured his position at the new Sterling Cooper with the help of Roger Sterling. However, since his divorce from Betty he has consistently fluctuated between problem drinking and moderation depending on his personal circumstances.\n\n== Reception ==\n[[File:Jon Hamm at PaleyFest 2014.jpg|150px|thumb|right|upright|Hamm received two [[Golden Globe Awards]] and a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for his performance]]\nHamm's portrayal of Don Draper received acclaim from critics and audiences alike.\n\nDan Fienberg of ''[[HitFix]]'' wrote \"Hamm's performance as Don Draper is the decade's definitive star turn, a breakout on par with what [[George Clooney]] did on ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' for a brief period of the '90s. All Jon Hamm had to do was convince producers that there was value in Jon Hamm and he's done that in spades. If Matthew Weiner has occasionally pushed up against the limits of Hamm's range, it's only because Draper has been written as such a tortured and frequently unravelling character. To my mind, every time you think you've seen Hamm hit a wall, you get an episode like '[[The Hobo Code]]' or '[[For Those Who Think Young (Mad Men)|For Those Who Think Young]]' or '[[Meditations in an Emergency (Mad Men)|Meditations in an Emergency]]' or, especially, this past season's '[[The Gypsy and the Hobo (Mad Men)|The Gypsy and the Hobo]].'\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/the-fien-print/posts/tv-s-best-of-the-decade-no-3-mad-men|title=TV's Best of the Decade: No. 3 \u2013 'Mad Men'|date=December 29, 2009|website=Uproxx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170123161144/http://uproxx.com/hitfix/tv-s-best-of-the-decade-no-3-mad-men/|archive-date=January 23, 2017|url-status=live|last1=Fienberg|first1=Dan|accessdate=January 23, 2017}}</ref> Bee Wilson of ''The Guardian'' praised Hamm's performance writing that \"The Eames chairs and hour-glass dresses are a visual treat, but it's really all about Jon Hamm's performance as a man sickened by his womanising and in thrall to his own pretty lies\".<ref>{{cite web|first=Bee|last=Wilson|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/16/my-highlight-mad-men-bee-wilson|title=My highlight: Mad Men by Bee Wilson|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=May 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170123161305/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/16/my-highlight-mad-men-bee-wilson|archive-date=January 23, 2017|url-status=live|accessdate=January 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, ''[[Ask Men]]'' named the fictional Don Draper the most influential man in the world, ahead of real-life figures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.askmen.com/specials/2009_top_49/don-draper-1.html |title=2009 Top 49 Most Influential Men |website=Askmen.com |accessdate=June 3, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612073951/http://www.askmen.com/specials/2009_top_49/don-draper-1.html|archivedate=June 12, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Additionally, [[Comcast]] listed him among TV's Most Intriguing Characters.<ref>{{cite web|title=TV's Most Intriguing Characters|url=http://xfinity.comcast.net/slideshow/tv-intriguingCharacters/5/|publisher=[[Comcast]]|accessdate=February 1, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014103322/http://xfinity.comcast.net/slideshow/tv-intriguingcharacters/5/|archive-date=October 14, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' included Draper on its list of The 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years,<ref>{{cite web|first=Adam|last=Vary|title=The 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years: Here's our full list!|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2010/06/01/100-greatest-characters-of-last-20-years-full-list|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=June 1, 2010|accessdate=August 30, 2015}}</ref> and in 2015, they named Draper one of the 25 Best TV Characters of the Past 25 Years.<ref>{{cite web|title=25 Best TV Characters in the Past 25 Years|url=http://www.ew.com/gallery/25-best-tv-characters/2334136_don-draper-mad-men-jon-hamm|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=October 12, 2015|accessdate=October 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\nHamm received eight nominations for the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series|Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series]] for every season that Mad Men was eligible. Hamm failed to win seven times, losing out four times to [[Bryan Cranston]] for his portrayal of [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] in ''[[Breaking Bad]]''. Many critics felt that Matthew Weiner unnecessarily split up the final season of ''Mad Men'' over two parts and two years so Hamm would have an opportunity for the Emmy at last, since ''Breaking Bad'' had already ended its final season. Hamm indeed won his final nomination at the [[67th Primetime Emmy Awards]]. Hamm crawled onto the stage, making fun of his nearly decade long quest to win an Emmy.\n\nIn addition to his Emmy, Hamm won the [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Television Series Drama|Best Actor - Television Series Drama]] twice, in [[65th Golden Globe Awards|2008]] and [[73rd Golden Globe Awards|2016]]. He is tied with [[Ed Asner]], [[John Forsythe]], [[Hugh Laurie]] and [[Tom Selleck]] for most wins in the category. He also won the [[TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Drama]] twice, in [[27th TCA Awards|2011]] and [[31st TCA Awards|2015]]; won the [[Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series]] in [[1st Critics' Choice Television Awards|2011]]; and received six nominations for the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series]].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.amctv.com/shows/mad-men/cast/don-draper Don Draper] at AMCtv.com\n* {{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-07-22/don-drapers-sex-appeal-in-mad-men/ |title=The Secret of Don Draper's Sex Appeal|author=Natasha Vargas-Cooper |work=[[The Daily Beast]] |date=July 22, 2010}}\n{{Mad Men}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Draper, Don}}\n[[Category:Mad Men characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Fictional Korean War veterans]]\n[[Category:Fictional Republicans (United States)]]\n[[Category:Fictional alcohol abusers]]\n[[Category:Fictional smokers]]\n[[Category:Fictional advertising executives]]\n[[Category:Fictional business executives]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2007]]\n[[Category:Fictional victims of child abuse]]\n[[Category:Fictional child sexual abuse victims]]\n[[Category:Fictional impostors]]\n[[Category:Fictional United States Army personnel]]\n[[Category:Fictional orphans]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Character from Mad Men}}\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Don Draper\n| series             = [[Mad Men]]\n| image              = Don Draper Wiki.jpg\n| caption            = [[Jon Hamm]] as Don Draper\n| first              = \"[[Smoke Gets in Your Eyes (Mad Men)|Smoke Gets in Your Eyes]]\" (2007)\n| last               = \"[[Person to Person (Mad Men)|Person to Person]]\" (2015)\n| creator            = [[Matthew Weiner]]\n| portrayer          = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Jon Hamm]]\n* [[Brandon Killham]] (Young Dick Whitman)\n* Troy Ruptash (Lieutenant Donald Draper)\n}}\n| full_name          = Donald Francis Draper\n| alias              = Richard Whitman (birth name)\n| nicknames          = {{Plainlist|\n* Don\n* Dick\n}}\n| occupation         = {{Plainlist|\n* Senior Partner and Creative Director, Sterling Cooper & Partners (season 6\u2013present; End of Season 7 Part 1 for Creative Director)\n* Founding Partner, Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce (seasons 4\u20136)\n* Creative Director, Sterling Cooper (seasons 1\u20133)\n}}\n| family             = {{Plainlist|\n* Archibald Whitman\n* Evangeline\n* Abigail Whitman (stepmother)\n* Uncle Mac (stepfather)\n}}\n| spouses            = {{Plainlist|\n* {{marriage|Anna M.

Up to the Season 3 finale, Draper was [[creative director]] of fictional [[Manhattan]] [[advertising firm]] Sterling Cooper. He then became a founding partner at a new firm, Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, after he and his superiors left their previous agency in advance of an unwanted acquisition. The agency later [[mergers and acquisitions|merged]] with a rival firm, Cutler Gleason & Chaough, to become Sterling Cooper & Partners while pursuing a contract from [[Chevrolet]].\n\nThe character of Don Draper is partially inspired by Draper Daniels, a creative director at [[Leo Burnett Worldwide|Leo Burnett advertising agency]] in [[Chicago]] in the 1950s, who worked on the [[Marlboro Man]] campaign.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Myra Janco |last=Daniels|title=I Married a Mad Man|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/August-2009/I-Married-a-Mad-Man/|magazine=[[Chicago (magazine)|Chicago]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=August 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801085117/http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/August-2009/I-Married-a-Mad-Man/|archivedate=August 1, 2010|accessdate=April 8, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Character biography ==\n=== Early life ===\nDonald Francis Draper is revealed through flashbacks to be the assumed identity of <!-- PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS NAME, THE CHARACTER'S BIRTH NAME IS RICHARD WHITMAN, THIS HAS BEEN CITED AND VERIFIED.

His mother died in labor, and his father was killed from a kick by a spooked horse, an accident a 10-year-old Dick witnessed.\n\nDick was raised primarily by Archie's second wife Abigail (Brynn Horrocks), who treated him with cruelty because she saw his very existence as a reminder of her husband\u2019s infidelity. She had a son named Adam, who was Dick's half-brother. The one person to show him any kindness as a child was \"Uncle Mack,\" ([[Morgan Rusler]]) who taught him how to survive in the real world. Mack was \"with\" Abigail's sister and ran the brothel where Dick and Adam grew up after leaving the family farm. Many years later, Dick recalled one of his few exposures to the outside world was the story of [[Milton Hershey]] and his school for orphaned children, and wondered why he failed to qualify for such a place considering both his parents were deceased, which made him think he was forgotten. One of the prostitutes had Dick and Adam pickpocket coins from trousers while she was turning tricks, to which the boys would be paid in the form of Hershey bars. Don recalls eating these as the closest he ever got to a \"normal childhood\".\n\nDuring this period of his life, he began to suffer from [[croup]] and was left under the care of a prostitute named Aim\u00e9e ([[Megan Ferguson]]).

A seriously wounded Whitman switches Draper's dog tags with his own before passing out. He later awakens in a U.S. Army field hospital, presumed to be Lieutenant Draper, and is awarded the [[Purple Heart]]. He is sent home on a train with Lieutenant Draper's coffin (believed to be Private Whitman's) to offer the Army's regrets to Whitman's survivors. He avoids meeting the Whitmans at the train station but is spotted by Adam ([[Jay Paulson]]), whose parents fail to recognize him. Years later Adam tracks his half-brother down in New York, but \"Draper\" insists on leaving the past behind and coldly rejects him, paying him off with a check for $5,000 to keep the [[identity theft]] secret. Years later, Dick learned Adam took this so hard he hung himself. \n\nWhitman begins his life anew as Don Draper, working as a used-car salesman. [[List of Mad Men characters#Anna Draper|Anna M. Draper]] ([[Melinda Page Hamilton]]), widow of the real Don Draper, tracks him down. He informs her of Don's death and confesses to his masquerade. The two form a close bond that continues for many years. Anna remains a close friend and confidante until her death from [[bone cancer]] in 1965.\n\n=== Life as \"Don Draper\" ===\nThe new Don Draper relocates to New York City, where he works as a [[furrier|fur]] salesman and attends [[City College of New York|City College]] at night. With the support of his boss, he writes advertising copy for the fur company, helping him build a portfolio along with some spec ads. It is at this job that Draper meets his future wife, [[Betty Draper|Eizabeth \"Betty\" Hofstadt]] ([[January Jones]]), a model who is photographed for one of his own ads. After a chance meeting at the store, he tricks a drunken [[Roger Sterling]] ([[John Slattery]]) into offering him a job at Sterling Cooper, and eventually becomes its [[Creative director|Creative Director]].\n\nHe is considered a major asset to the company, as he has considerable talent for understanding the desires of others and for effectively pitching and selling ideas. Because of this, he is occasionally courted by other advertising firms. Although he keeps his true character heavily guarded, almost everyone at the firm is portrayed as respecting his talent. At the same time, many in the firm are also troubled by Draper's erratic behavior.\n\n[[Peggy Olson]] ([[Elisabeth Moss]])  begins her career at Sterling Cooper as Draper's secretary, but with her boss' support she becomes a [[copywriter]]. Throughout the series their relationship is portrayed as one of trust and mutual respect, even as Peggy advances in her career and eventually leaves the firm.\n\nDraper and Betty are married in May 1953, and eventually move into a house with an address shown as 42 Bullet Park Road, [[Ossining (village), New York|Ossining]] in [[Westchester County, New York]]. They have two children - Sally ([[Kiernan Shipka]]), born in 1954 or early 1955, and Bobby ([[Maxwell Huckabee]]), born in 1957 or early 1958.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Chrysanthemum and the Sword|series=Mad Men|serieslink=Mad Men|network=[[AC]]{{dn|date=March 2020}}|season=4|number=5|airdate=August 22, 2010|quote=In this episode, Don tells Dr. Faye Miller the ages of his children.

While the new agency (rebranded Sterling Cooper & Partners, SC&P) is successful, at the end of Season 6, he is forced to take \"a leave of absence\" from the new firm because of his erratic behavior, which costs the firm a possible advertising account with [[Hershey Chocolate]].<ref name=\"care\">{{cite episode |title=In Care Of |series=Mad Men |network=AMC |airdate=June 23, 2013 |season=6 |number=13}}</ref>\n\nDraper works as a freelancer for a year while still technically on SC&P's payroll. Megan has moved to Los Angeles to pursue her acting career, and asks him for a divorce. Feeling guilty over his past infidelities, Draper gives her a generous divorce settlement. SC&P eventually allows him to come back on the condition that he stops drinking on the job. He does his work well and eventually assumes his old position with the company. Following Bert Cooper's death, Roger Sterling, with Draper and other partners' support, sells SC&P to McCann as an independent and separate subsidiary. The arrangement lasts for a year before McCann decides to fully absorb SC&P. McCann's executives groom Draper as management material, but he panics at the thought of being tied down and leaves the company in the middle of a meeting.\n\nDraper embarks upon a nomadic existence as a mechanic, and in the series' final episode, \"Person to Person\", moves into a commune with Anna's niece Stephanie ([[Caity Lotz]]).

With that gesture being the start of their relationship, Betty and Don were soon married. The couple later has their first child, Sally, soon followed by a son, Bobby. In Season 3, the Drapers have another son, Gene, named after Betty's recently deceased father.\n\nDon cheats on his wife repeatedly throughout Seasons 1 and 2. In Season 1, he is involved with Midge Daniels ([[Rosemary DeWitt]]), a [[marijuana|pot]]-smoking artist and [[beatnik]] who works out of a small apartment in [[Greenwich Village]]. Her [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle and friends do not appeal to Don, but their relationship offers him an escape from his high-pressure job and life of responsibilities. When he receives a bonus check of $2,500 from Sterling Cooper, he asks her to vacation with him in [[Paris]]. He changes his mind after realizing Midge is in love with a fellow [[beatnik]], and instead stuffs the check into her blouse, telling her to 'go buy a car' with it. Don doesn't see her again until Season 4, when Midge pretends to inadvertently run into him with the hope of selling a painting to help fund her [[heroin]] addiction. He agrees to visit her apartment but, after learning of her true intentions, somberly purchases a painting and leaves.\n\nDuring and after his affair with Midge, Don pursues [[List of Mad Men characters#Rachel Menken|Rachel Menken]] ([[Maggie Siff]]), the daughter of Abraham Menken , the elderly Jewish founder of the upscale Menken's Department Store. Rachel is educated, sophisticated, and a savvy businesswoman, assisting her father in running the family business. Despite bickering with her during their initial business meetings, Don and she become intimate, and they eventually begin an affair. Their relationship collapses after he professes a desire to run away with her, prompting Rachel to realize Draper simply wants an excuse to run away and forget his responsibilities. She leaves on a cruise to [[Europe]] and marries sometime before the beginning of Season 2.\n\nIn Season 2, Draper has an affair with [[List of Mad Men characters#Jimmy and Bobbie Barrett|Bobbie Barrett]] ([[Melinda McGraw]]), the wife of Jimmy Barrett ([[Patrick Fischler]]), an [[insult comic]] who is filming a commercial for one of Sterling Cooper's clients, [[Utz Quality Foods, Inc.|Utz Potato Chips]]. Don admires her savvy and boldness and the pair enter into a sexualized power struggle. They continue their affair, taking a trip to Bobbie's beach house in [[Stony Brook, New York|Stony Brook]] on [[Long Island]], but their plans are interrupted by a car accident. Arrested for [[drunk driving]] and unable to post bond with the cash on his person, Don reaches out to Peggy, who travels from [[Brooklyn]] to Long Island in the middle of the night to post his bail. Bobbie stays with Peggy until her injuries from the accident heal. The affair between Draper and Bobbie continues until the episode \"Maidenform\", when she lets it slip that his previous mistresses have been talking about his sexual prowess. Because he highly values his privacy, Draper is disgusted that his extramarital escapades are being gossiped about, and immediately ends the affair. He must continue his professional relationship with the Barretts. The Drapers and the Barretts meet at the [[Stork Club]] for a night out. At the end of the evening, Jimmy reveals to Betty that their spouses have had an affair. When Betty confronts him, Draper repeatedly denies the accusations, infuriating her.\n\nThe strain leads to Don and Betty's first separation, and he moves into a hotel room.  His father-in-law has another stroke, necessitating a visit from Dan at the Hofstadt home to keep up the appearance of a happy marriage. In his post-stroke confusion, Hofstadt openly expresses his disdain for his son-in-law, saying, \"He's got no people. You can't trust a man like that.\" Don comforts Betty, who is distraught at her father\u2019s decline, and they have sex, leading Don to believe that Betty has forgiven him. When they arrive home, however, Betty tells him not to move back in, saying \"We were only pretending.\"\n\nHis life in flux, Don impulsively decides to join [[Pete Campbell]] on a business trip to [[Los Angeles]]. In California, he meets a mysterious European [[viscount]] with a 21-year-old daughter named Joy ([[Laura Ramsay]]). Despite telling Campbell that the trip is strictly business, Draper joins Joy and her \"jet set\" family of self-described nomads at their lavish vacation home in [[Palm Springs]]. He sleeps with her the same night then leaves Joy the next morning to visit Anna Draper, who convinces him to return home to his wife and family. Later, Draper returns to Ossining and tells Betty he \"wasn't respectful\" to her. Betty reveals she is [[pregnant]].\n\nIn episode 1 of season 3, Don and colleague [[Salvatore Romano]] ([[Bryan Batt]]) go on a business trip to [[Baltimore]]. Don has a one-night-stand with stewardess Shelly ([[Laura Beth Coakley]]), who tells Don she's engaged and that this may be the only chance she has left to dally. He responds: \"I've been married a long time; you get plenty of chances.\"\n\nIn Season 3, Don has an affair lasting several months with his daughter's schoolteacher, [[List of Mad Men characters#Suzanne Farrell|Suzanne Farrell]] ([[Abigail Spencer]]). Their relationship builds slowly over several accidental meetings and conversations laden with innuendo. Don becomes infatuated by Suzanne's optimism and kindness and they finally consummate their relationship in September 1963. On October 30, 1963, he plans a weekend get-away with Suzanne, believing his wife and children are out of town. While Suzanne waits in the car, he enters his house to retrieve a suitcase and is stunned to find Betty at home. She reveals that she's found a key to the locked drawer in Draper's desk and discovered the box of photographs and other evidence of his past life, as well as several hundred dollars in emergency escape funds. Forced to reveal his true identity, Don never returns to the car and Suzanne eventually walks home. Even though they have not been discovered, he calls her the next day to break off the relationship. Draper begins an unsuccessful attempt to save his marriage, but Betty uses his lies about his life and past as an excuse to divorce him in order to marry [[List of Mad Men characters#Henry Francis|Henry Francis]], an aide to New York State governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]].\n\nFollowing the dissolution of his marriage, Don's relationship with women reaches its nadir during Season 4, which takes place from 1964 to 1965. At the beginning of Season 4, set in 1964, he hires a prostitute named Candace ([[Erin Cummings]]) to slap him during sex. Roger Sterling's wife, [[List of Mad Men characters#Jane Sterling (n\u00e9e Siegel)|Jane Sterling]] ([[Peyton List (actress, born 1986)|Peyton List]]), sets Draper up with [[List of Mad Men characters#Bethany Van Nuys|Bethany]] ([[Anna Camp]]), a friend of hers. They go on three dates, but the relationship goes nowhere, as he regards her as sweet and pretty, but interchangeable. After winning at the [[Clio Awards]] and during a weekend of heavy drinking, Draper goes to bed with one woman and blacks out, wakes up with a different woman, and has no recollection of what has happened. He continues to visit the prostitute and pay her, eventually setting Lane Pryce up with the prostitute one night in his apartment. While on a trip to California he visits Anna in [[San Pedro, California|San Pedro]], and attempts to seduce her 18-year-old niece Stephanie. Because she has known Draper since she was a child, she declines and tells him that her aunt has cancer. Later in the season, as Anna is on her deathbed, Draper repeatedly contemplates calling her, but can't bring himself to say goodbye until it's too late.\n\nWhen Draper goes home drunk after an office Christmas party, he forgets the keys to his apartment. He asks [[List of Mad Men characters#Allison|Allison]] ([[Alexa Alemanni]]), his secretary, to deliver the keys to him. Having had a crush on him all along, she retrieves his keys and brings them back to his apartment, where Draper is barely conscious. Instead of leaving his keys and going back to the party, Allison invites herself inside and offers to cook for him.  He refuses and collapses onto his couch. As she begins to leave, Draper makes a pass at her; she returns the attention and has sex with him.<ref>{{cite video|title=Talked About Scene Episode 402 Mad Men: Don's Secretary Does Him a Favor Season 4, Episode 2|date=August 1, 2010|url=http://www.amctv.com/mad-men/videos/mad-men-talked-about-scene-dons-secretary-does-him-a-favor|work=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]}}</ref> This later creates tension in their professional relationship when Draper tries to act as if nothing happened and gives her a large Christmas bonus to make up for her inadvertently hurt feelings. Confused and heartbroken, Allison decides she can no longer work for him or the agency and finds another job. She asks Don to write a letter of recommendation for her; he tells her that she can write it herself and that he will sign off on whatever she writes. Insulted and enraged, she throws a brass cigarette dispenser at him, calls him \"a bad person,\" and storms out in tears. Visibly shaken by the encounter, Draper later attempts to write a letter of apology to her, but then decides to leave it be.\n\nLater in Season 4, Draper becomes friendly with [[List of Mad Men characters#Faye Miller|Dr. Faye Miller]] ([[Cara Buono]]), a [[consumer psychology|consumer psychologist]] he frequently works with. At the beginning of 1965, before the two start dating, she informs him, \"you'll be married by the end of the year.\" After fending off his gentlemanly advances on several occasions, she begins a romantic relationship with him. During an extreme anxiety attack after believing he'd been discovered as the AWOL Dick Whitman, Don reveals his checkered past to Faye. She responds with sympathy and emotional support, and advises he confront the issues in his life and turn himself in. In another episode, Sally suddenly shows up at the agency's offices, and Draper asks Faye to look after his daughter; Faye warns him she is not good with children, is inexperienced around them, and does not have maternal feelings. At the end of the same episode, Sally flees from Draper, runs down the hall, then trips and falls into the arms of Draper's new secretary, [[List of Mad Men characters#Megan Draper|Megan Calvet]], who consoles the child much more effectively than Faye did. Faye feels forced into the situation and gets angry at Draper for asking her to watch his daughter, telling him, \"it felt like a test, and I failed.\"\n\nAs Season 4 progresses, Draper is no longer visiting prostitutes and seems to have settled down with Faye. Although he seems to be satisfied in his relationship with her, he begins to notice and grow close with his secretary, Megan. Draper is surprised when Megan reveals herself to be intelligent, liberal, and eager to learn from him and Peggy about advertising. His business faces a severe hardship that indirectly threatens his and Faye's relationship. Megan seeks to help relieve his tensions and the pair have sex in his office one night; he is ambivalent at first, but she assuredly tells him not to worry because she only wants to have sex with him and she won't make a scene about it. With Faye's consulting firm no longer working with SCDP, she is pleased because she and Draper can now be \"out in the open\" with their relationship.\n\nDuring the Season 4 finale, \"Tomorrowland,\" Faye believes their relationship is stronger than ever. However, when Betty suddenly fires her children's long-time nanny, Draper scrambles to find a nanny for his three children for their upcoming visit to California and, remembering how good Megan was with children previous, asks her to accompany them on the trip. He goes to Anna's house one last time, and Stephanie tells him that Anna left him the diamond solitaire engagement ring given to her by the real Don Draper upon their engagement. Draper ends up sleeping with Megan during the trip and impulsively decides to propose to her with the engagement ring. He tells her the ring is very special to him and that he \"finally feels like himself\" with her. Megan accepts, and upon returning to New York, Draper telephones Faye, an breaks off their relationship by informing her of his engagement. Draper also informs Betty as she is packing up the last moving box from the home they shared together in Ossining.\n\nWhen the fifth season opens, in May 1966, it is revealed that Draper has told Megan all about his past and his real identity. It is also revealed that they married sometime between seasons four and five (between October 1965 and May 1966) and have moved into a penthouse apartment on Park Avenue and 73rd. Over the course of the first year of their, Draper is besotted with Megan and her natural skill at her work. When Megan decides she wants to quit advertising to pursue her dream of being an actress, Draper is initially skeptical and his feelings hurt, but wanting to make her happy, he relents. He remains fearful of her acting career, and they begin to argue more frequently. One of these arguments is over his past relationships, when they encounter one of his former girlfriends, Andrea Rhodes ([[M\u00e4dchen Amick]]). After encountering Rhodes, Don develops a severe fever and leaves work early to lay down. While he is sleeping, he hallucinates that Rhodes enters his apartment and forces herself upon him sexually even as he tries to tell her \"no\". Rhodes describes a scene of the past of them having sex, while Betty is waiting for him around the corner. The fever dream climaxes with Draper \"killing\" her. When he wakes the next morning, fever broken, he is terrified before realizing that it was all just a dream and that Megan has been with him all night, nursing him back to health.\n\nIn the sixth season, sometime before January 1968, Draper begins an affair with his married downstairs neighbor, Sylvia Rosen ([[Linda Cardellini]]). They both feel discontented with their respective marriages and enjoy the thrill and convenience of their secret affair, but struggle to balance feelings of guilt; Draper is friends with Sylvia's husband Arnold ([[Brian Markinson]]) and Sylvia is close with Megan. In June 1968, the two of them engage in a days-long [[BDSM]] sexual role-play game in a Manhattan hotel. After having a dream about the two of them that she saw as an omen, Sylvia ends their affair. When Draper later helps Sylvia's son avoid [[Vietnam War|service in Vietnam]], their affair temporarily resumes until Sally discovers them together.\n\nAs the series ends in season seven, Draper, now divorced a second time, is reminded of Rachel while dealing with a conflict at work. He reaches out to her only to discover that she has died of cancer. Not long after, he runs into Diana Bauer ([[Elizabeth Reaser]]), a waitress who bears a resemblance to Rachel. The two begin an affair, but it comes crashing down when it's revealed Diana is dealing with her past. Draper encourages her to forget it and move on, but she insists that ignoring past hurts is the wrong way to deal with life, and the two go their separate ways.\n\n== Personality ==\n{{Essay-like|date=April 2013}}\nDespite his outward cynicism and egotism, the character of Don Draper demonstrates a strict code of personal [[ethics]], insisting on honesty and [[chivalry]] in his subordinates, but not always in himself. He is protective of his subordinates, admonishing [[Pete Campbell]] in the pilot about his rude remarks to and about [[Peggy Olson]]. Draper is also protective of his colleagues; for example, he berates several subordinates for mocking [[Freddy Rumsen]]'s ([[Joel Murray]]) episode of [[urinary incontinence]], a symptom of Rumsen's [[alcoholism]].<ref>{{cite episode |title=Six Month Leave |series=Mad Men |network=AMC |airdate=September 28, 2008 |season=2 |number=09}}</ref>\n\nDraper adheres to a stricter code of [[business ethics]] than many of his colleagues. A [[Mad Men (season 2)|Season 2]] arc has him upset about being told to drop the smaller local [[Mohawk Airlines]] as a client in hopes of picking up [[American Airlines]]. In [[Mad Men (season 3)|Season 3]], he is hesitant to sign a wealthy client eager to pour his fortune into promoting [[jai alai]], a sport the client thinks will replace [[baseball]] as \"America's game\", which Draper thinks is a doomed enterprise. He is also the only partner to protest a scheme hatched by Pete Campbell and a potential client that involves Joan's sleeping with a [[Jaguar Cars]] executive in order to secure the account.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Other Woman |series=Mad Men |network=AMC |airdate=May 27, 2012 |season=5 |number=11}}</ref> \n\nDraper briefly becomes a confidant to [[art director]] Sal Romano, a [[the closet|closeted]] [[homosexual]] whom Draper finds in a compromising position with another man in a [[Baltimore]] hotel. On their way back to New York, Draper gently lets Romano know he is aware of his homosexuality and couches his comments about their [[London Fog (company)|London Fog]] account artwork to offer him advice about being cautious.<ref name=\"out\">{{cite episode |title=Out of Town |series=Mad Men |network=AMC |airdate=August 6, 2009 |season=3 |number=1}}</ref> Later on, when Romano won't give in to [[Lucky Strike]] executive Lee Garner Jr.'s (Darren Pettie) sexual demands, Garner has him fired.<ref name=\"MadMenEp309\">{{cite episode |title=Wee Small Hours |series=Mad Men |network=AMC |airdate=October 9, 2010 |season=3 |number=09}}</ref> Romano goes to Draper for help, but when he explains what happened, Draper tells him he supports his dismissal, since Lucky Strike is too big a client to lose, and implies that Romano should have given Garner what he wanted. In contrast to the tolerant attitude he had earlier shown his colleague, he regards Romano now with [[homophobia|homophobic]] disdain.<ref name=\"MadMenEp309\" />\n\nWhile the Don Draper character is not color-blind in matters of [[Race (human classification)|race]], he recognizes the [[Civil Rights Movement|changes sweeping the country]] and acknowledges the advertising potential of \"the Negro market\". In the pilot, he is seen asking a black waiter about the waiter's [[cigarette]] preferences. In another episode, he attends a festive [[Kentucky Derby]] party hosted by Roger Sterling and watches with disgust as Sterling serenades his young wife in [[blackface]]. Draper and Pete Campbell seem to be the only guests who disapprove of, or are uncomfortable with, the spectacle.<ref>{{cite episode |title=My Old Kentucky Home |series=Mad Men |network=AMC |airdate=August 30, 2009 |season=3 |number=3}}</ref>\n\nDraper is loyal to many of his coworkers, and is particularly close to Peggy Olson and Joan Harris; they are two of the only women he has ever had a completely platonic relationship with. Draper and Pete Campbell initially dislike one another, as Draper at first sees Pete as the spoiled son of a wealthy \"old money\" New York City family, who received his job because of his family connections rather than professional talent. They eventually grow to respect each other, however, and a work friendship develops.  Draper watches Pete become a smart and driven advertising executive. Draper also has a close relationship with Roger Sterling. They are generally depicted as overlooking each other's personal failings and supporting one another at work. Roger saves a drunken Draper from drowning after the latter falls into a swimming pool while they are attending a party in Hollywood. Meanwhile, Draper inspires Roger to refocus his efforts at SCDP, causing Roger to engineer the firm's acquisition of the Chevrolet account. Roger fights to get Draper reinstated at SCDP after his forced leave of absence.\n\nDraper is occasionally shown to regret how he treats his family. When Betty gives birth to their third child, he has a conversation with another man in the hospital waiting room who says he's going to be a better man for his wife and child.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Fog |series=Mad Men |network=AMC |airdate=September 13, 2009 |season=3 |number=5}}</ref> Although it is implied that Draper has similar convictions, he later acknowledges to his second wife that he feels a general state of disconnect between himself and his children.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Flood |series=Mad Men |network=AMC |airdate=April 28, 2013 |season=6 |number=5}}</ref> Draper's one consistent display of parental behavior is that he cannot tolerate Betty's often harsh treatment of Sally, and he has interceded on her behalf on those occasions.\n\nDraper detests his father-in-law, Eugene \"Gene\" Hofstadt ([[Ryan Cutrona]]), but agrees to take him into their home when Gene is no longer able to live on his own. At multiple points, Draper shows more patience and understanding toward his father-in-law than his wife. After Gene's death, however, Draper tells Betty that he and her father hated each other.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Grown-Ups |series=Mad Men |network=AMC |airdate=November 1, 2009 |season=3 |number=12}}</ref>\n\nLike many other characters in the series Draper is a heavy drinker, with his cocktail of choice being an [[Old Fashioned (cocktail)|Old Fashioned]]. While [[Canadian Club]] is his preferred liquor, bottles of [[Crown Royal]], [[Jameson Irish Whiskey|Jameson]], [[Wild Turkey (bourbon)|Wild Turkey]], [[Smirnoff]], [[Beefeater Gin|Beefeater]], and [[Tanqueray]] can also be seen in his home and office.\n\nThroughout the series, Draper displays signs of [[alcoholism]], which eventually deteriorates to a level of [[alcohol dependency]] that endangers his job. In Season 4, following his divorce from Betty, his drinking reaches a point that he begins experiencing [[Blackout (drug-related amnesia)|alcoholic blackouts]], resulting in his keeping a journal as means of coming to terms with his situation and cutting down on his consumption. By the end of season 6, having battled constantly with his crisis of identity, Draper is forced to take a leave of absence after revealing the truth about his upbringing to the would-be lucrative and prestigious client, [[The Hershey Company|Hershey's]]. His confession is brought on by a pre-presentation round of drinks, and is the concluding incident in a long line of other drinking-related incidents that lead the partners of SC&P to finally take action; they put him on indefinite leave. Draper is hired back during Season 7, with a sobriety clause in his new contract.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Field Trip |series=Mad Men |network=AMC |airdate=April 27, 2014 |season=7 |number=2}}</ref> He violates these terms when he realizes during a conversation regarding new business with Bert Cooper that he is no longer valued as an active player in the agency. The other partners however do not realize this because [[Freddy Rumsen]], who has since achieved sobriety, receives a call from Draper and takes him out of the office under the pretense of seeing a [[New York Mets]] game thereby keeping him away from the office until he sobers up the next morning. By the end of Season 7, Draper has succeeded in curbing his drinking, and has secured his position at the new Sterling Cooper with the help of Roger Sterling. However, since his divorce from Betty he has consistently fluctuated between problem drinking and moderation depending on his personal circumstances.\n\n== Reception ==\n[[File:Jon Hamm at PaleyFest 2014.jpg|150px|thumb|right|upright|Hamm received two [[Golden Globe Awards]] and a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for his performance]]\nHamm's portrayal of Don Draper received acclaim from critics and audiences alike.\n\nDan Fienberg of ''[[HitFix]]'' wrote \"Hamm's performance as Don Draper is the decade's definitive star turn, a breakout on par with what [[George Clooney]] did on ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' for a brief period of the '90s. All Jon Hamm had to do was convince producers that there was value in Jon Hamm and he's done that in spades. If Matthew Weiner has occasionally pushed up against the limits of Hamm's range, it's only because Draper has been written as such a tortured and frequently unravelling character. To my mind, every time you think you've seen Hamm hit a wall, you get an episode like '[[The Hobo Code]]' or '[[For Those Who Think Young (Mad Men)|For Those Who Think Young]]' or '[[Meditations in an Emergency (Mad Men)|Meditations in an Emergency]]' or, especially, this past season's '[[The Gypsy and the Hobo (Mad Men)|The Gypsy and the Hobo]].'\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/the-fien-print/posts/tv-s-best-of-the-decade-no-3-mad-men|title=TV's Best of the Decade: No. 3 \u2013 'Mad Men'|date=December 29, 2009|website=Uproxx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170123161144/http://uproxx.com/hitfix/tv-s-best-of-the-decade-no-3-mad-men/|archive-date=January 23, 2017|url-status=live|last1=Fienberg|first1=Dan|accessdate=January 23, 2017}}</ref> Bee Wilson of ''The Guardian'' praised Hamm's performance writing that \"The Eames chairs and hour-glass dresses are a visual treat, but it's really all about Jon Hamm's performance as a man sickened by his womanising and in thrall to his own pretty lies\".<ref>{{cite web|first=Bee|last=Wilson|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/16/my-highlight-mad-men-bee-wilson|title=My highlight: Mad Men by Bee Wilson|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=May 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170123161305/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/16/my-highlight-mad-men-bee-wilson|archive-date=January 23, 2017|url-status=live|accessdate=January 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, ''[[Ask Men]]'' named the fictional Don Draper the most influential man in the world, ahead of real-life figures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.askmen.com/specials/2009_top_49/don-draper-1.html |title=2009 Top 49 Most Influential Men |website=Askmen.com |accessdate=June 3, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612073951/http://www.askmen.com/specials/2009_top_49/don-draper-1.html|archivedate=June 12, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Additionally, [[Comcast]] listed him among TV's Most Intriguing Characters.<ref>{{cite web|title=TV's Most Intriguing Characters|url=http://xfinity.comcast.net/slideshow/tv-intriguingCharacters/5/|publisher=[[Comcast]]|accessdate=February 1, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014103322/http://xfinity.comcast.net/slideshow/tv-intriguingcharacters/5/|archive-date=October 14, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' included Draper on its list of The 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years,<ref>{{cite web|first=Adam|last=Vary|title=The 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years: Here's our full list!|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2010/06/01/100-greatest-characters-of-last-20-years-full-list|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=June 1, 2010|accessdate=August 30, 2015}}</ref> and in 2015, they named Draper one of the 25 Best TV Characters of the Past 25 Years.<ref>{{cite web|title=25 Best TV Characters in the Past 25 Years|url=http://www.ew.com/gallery/25-best-tv-characters/2334136_don-draper-mad-men-jon-hamm|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=October 12, 2015|accessdate=October 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\nHamm received eight nominations for the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series|Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series]] for every season that Mad Men was eligible. Hamm failed to win seven times, losing out four times to [[Bryan Cranston]] for his portrayal of [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] in ''[[Breaking Bad]]''. Many critics felt that Matthew Weiner unnecessarily split up the final season of ''Mad Men'' over two parts and two years so Hamm would have an opportunity for the Emmy at last, since ''Breaking Bad'' had already ended its final season. Hamm indeed won his final nomination at the [[67th Primetime Emmy Awards]]. Hamm crawled onto the stage, making fun of his nearly decade long quest to win an Emmy.\n\nIn addition to his Emmy, Hamm won the [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Television Series Drama|Best Actor - Television Series Drama]] twice, in [[65th Golden Globe Awards|2008]] and [[73rd Golden Globe Awards|2016]]. He is tied with [[Ed Asner]], [[John Forsythe]], [[Hugh Laurie]] and [[Tom Selleck]] for most wins in the category. He also won the [[TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Drama]] twice, in [[27th TCA Awards|2011]] and [[31st TCA Awards|2015]]; won the [[Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series]] in [[1st Critics' Choice Television Awards|2011]]; and received six nominations for the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series]].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.amctv.com/shows/mad-men/cast/don-draper Don Draper] at AMCtv.com\n* {{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-07-22/don-drapers-sex-appeal-in-mad-men/ |title=The Secret of Don Draper's Sex Appeal|author=Natasha Vargas-Cooper |work=[[The Daily Beast]] |date=July 22, 2010}}\n{{Mad Men}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Draper, Don}}\n[[Category:Mad Men characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Fictional Korean War veterans]]\n[[Category:Fictional Republicans (United States)]]\n[[Category:Fictional alcohol abusers]]\n[[Category:Fictional smokers]]\n[[Category:Fictional advertising executives]]\n[[Category:Fictional business executives]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2007]]\n[[Category:Fictional victims of child abuse]]\n[[Category:Fictional child sexual abuse victims]]\n[[Category:Fictional impostors]]\n[[Category:Fictional United States Army personnel]]\n[[Category:Fictional orphans]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: ,  \u2192 , , \u2019s \u2192 's (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Draper"}
