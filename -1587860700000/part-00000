Being selfish and not caring about others, that person said she was proud of her for making peoples' lives worse in such a way which shows she sucks.\n\n'''Compulsory figures''' or '''school figures''' were formerly a segment of [[figure skating]], and gave the sport its name. They are the \"circular patterns which skaters trace on the ice to demonstrate skill in placing clean turns evenly on round circles\".<ref name=\"specialregs-1\" /> For approximately the first 50 years of figure skating as a sport, until 1947, compulsory figures made up 60 percent of the total score at most competitions around the world. These figures continued to dominate the sport, although they steadily declined in importance, until the [[International Skating Union]] (ISU) voted to discontinue them as a part of competitions in 1990. Learning and training in compulsory figures instilled discipline and control; some in the figure skating community considered them necessary to teach skaters basic skills. Skaters would train for hours to learn and execute them well, and competing and judging figures would often take up to eight hours during competitions.\n\nSkaters traced compulsory figures, and were judged according to their smoothness and accuracy. The circle is the basis of all figures. Other elements in compulsory figures include curves, change of foot, change of [[Glossary of figure skating terms#E|edge]], and turns. Skaters had to trace precise circles while completing difficult turns and edges. The simple \"figure eight\" shape was executed by connecting two circles; other figures included the [[3 turn|three turn]], the [[counter turn]], the [[rocker turn]], the [[bracket turn]], and the loop.\n\nAlthough few skaters continue to practice compulsory figures, and few coaches still teach them to skaters, some skaters and coaches believe compulsory figures give skaters an advantage in developing alignment, core strength, body control, and discipline. The World Figure Sport Society has conducted festivals and competitions of compulsory figures, endorsed by the [[Ice Skating Institute]], since 2015.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nTracing figures in the ice is the oldest form of figure skating, especially during its first 200 years of existence, when it was a recreational activity practiced mostly by men.  Combined skating, or \"the sophisticated tracing of geometric figures by groups of skaters\", dominated the sport for almost 50 years in England.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 4\u20135</ref>  ''The Art of Skating'', one of the earliest books about figure skating, was written by Robert Jones in 1772 and described five advanced figures, three of which were illustrated with large color plates.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 25\u201325</ref>  Jones' limited body of figures, which emphasized correct technique, were the accepted and basic repertoire of figures in 18th century England.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 27, 62</ref>  The [[Edinburgh Skating Club]], one of the oldest skating clubs in the world, described combined figures and those done by multiple skaters; interlocking figure eights were the most important.<ref>Hines, p. 27</ref>  According to writer Ellyn Kestnbaum, the Edinburgh Skating Club required prospective members to pass proficiency tests in what became compulsory figures.<ref>Kestnbaum, p. 58</ref> The London Skating Club, founded in 1830 in London, also required proficiency tests for members and pioneered combined skating, which contributed to the evolution of school figures.<ref>Kestnbaum, p. 60</ref>  Artistic skating in France, which was derived from the English style of figure skating and was influenced by [[ballet]], developed figures that emphasized artistry, body position, and grace of execution. Jean Garcin, a member of an elite group of skaters in France, wrote a book about figure skating in 1813 that included descriptions and illustrations of over 30 figures, including a series of circle-eight figures that skaters still use today.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 62\u201364</ref>\n\nGeorge Anderson, writing in 1852, described backward-skating figures, including the flying Mercury and the shamrock, as well as the Q figure, which became, in its various forms, an important part of the repertoire of skating movements for the rest of the 1800s.  Anderson also described two combined figures, the salutation (already described by Jones) and the satellite.  By the 1850s, the most important figures (eights, threes, and Qs) were developed, and formed the basis for figure skating at the time.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 30\u201331</ref>  In 1869, Henry Vandervell and T. Maxwell Witham from the London Skating Club wrote ''System of Figure Skating'', which described variations of the three turn (the only figure known before 1860), the bracket (first done on roller skates), the rocker, the Mohawk, the loop, the Q, and other figures.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 31, 32\u201334</ref>  The Mohawk, a two-foot turn on the same circle, most likely originated in North America.<ref name=\"hines-34\">Hines (2006), p. 34</ref>  Figure skating historian James Hines called grapevines, which was probably invented in Canada, \"the most American of all figures\".<ref>Hines (2006), p. 59</ref>  The Viennese style of figure skating, as described by Max Wirth's book in 1881, described connecting figures, which ultimately led to modern free skating programs.<ref>Hines (2006), p. 67</ref>\n\nIn 1868, the American Skating Congress, precursor to [[U.S. Figure Skating]], adopted a series of movements used during competitions between skaters from the U.S. and Canada. Until 1947, for approximately the first 50 years of the existence of figure skating as a sport, compulsory figures made up 60 percent of the total score at most competitions around the world.<ref name=\"loosemore\">{{cite news |last1=Loosemore |first1=Sandra |title='Figures' don't add up in competition anymore |url=http://cbs.sportsline.com/u/women/skating/dec98/loosemore121698.htm |accessdate=16 November 2019 |work=CBS SportsLine |date=16 December 1998|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727021537/http://cbs.sportsline.com/u/women/skating/dec98/loosemore121698.htm |archive-date=2008-07-27 }}</ref>  Other competitions held in the late 19th and early 20th centuries included [[special figures]], freeskating, and compulsories, most of the points they earned going towards how they performed the same set of compulsory moves.<ref>Kestnbaum, pp. 81\u201382</ref> The first international figure skating competition was in Vienna in 1882;<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=https://www.isu.org/isu-history |publisher=International Skating Union |accessdate=16 November 2019}}</ref><ref>Hines (2011), p. xx</ref> according to Kestnbaum, it established a precedent for future competitions.<ref name=\"cultureonice-67\"/> Skaters were required to perform 23 compulsory figures, as well as a four-minute freeskating program, and a section called \"special figures\", in which they had to perform moves or combinations of moves that highlighted their advanced skills.<ref name=\"cultureonice-67\">Kestnbaum, p. 67</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-C0110-0014-001, Gabriele Seyfert, Ralph Borghardt.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ralph Borghardt]] and [[Gabriele Seyfert]] examine the print of a loop figure at the 1964 [[East German Figure Skating Championships|East German Championships]].|alt=Man on the left and woman on the right crouching on a piece of ice on a rink, the man tracing a figure on the ice with his thumb]]\n\nCompulsory figures were an important part of figure skating for the rest of the 19th century until the 1930s and 1940s. The first [[1891 European Figure Skating Championships|European Championships in 1891]] consisted of only compulsory figures.<ref>Hines (2011), p. 12</ref> In 1896, the newly formed [[International Skating Union]] (ISU) sponsored the [[1896 World Figure Skating Championships|first annual World Figure Skating Championships]] in St. Petersburg. The competition consisted of compulsory figures and freeskating.<ref>Kestnbaum, p. 68</ref> Skaters had to perform six compulsory moves, or figures, so that judges could compare skaters according to an established standard. Compulsory figures were worth 60 percent of the competitors' total scores. Special figures were not included in World Championships, although they were included as a separate discipline in other competitions, including the [[1908 Summer Olympics|Olympics in 1908]].<ref name=\"cultureonice-82\"/>\n\nIn 1897, the ISU adopted a schedule of 41 school figures, each of increasing difficulty, which were proposed by the British. They remained the standard compulsory figures used throughout the world in proficiency testing and competitions until 1990, and U.S. Figure Skating continued to use them as a separate discipline in the 1990s. After [[World War II]], more countries were sending skaters to international competitions, so the ISU cut the numbers of figures to a maximum of six due to the extended time it took to judge them all.<ref name=\"cultureonice-82\"/><ref name=\"loosemore\"/>\n\n===Demise===\nCompulsory figures began to be progressively devalued in 1967, when the values of both compulsory figures and free skating were changed to 50 percent.<ref>Hines (2006), p. 197</ref> In 1973, the number of figures was decreased from six to three, and their overall weight was decreased to 30 percent, to make room for the introduction of the [[Short program (figure skating)|short program]].<ref name=\"loosemore\"/><ref name=\"nomorefigures\"/>  Hines stated that the decrease in the importance of compulsory figures was due to \"the unbalanced skating\"<ref name=\"hines2006-204\">Hines, (2006), p. 204</ref> of women skaters such as [[Trixi Schuba|Beatrix \"Trixi\" Schuba]] of Austria, who Hines called \"the last great practitioner of compulsory figures\".<ref name=\"hines2006-204\"/>  Schuba won several medals in the late 1960s and early 1970s based upon the strength of her figures, despite her lower results in free skating.  As Hines stated, \"she could not be defeated under a scoring system that gave preference to figures\".<ref name=\"hines2006-204\"/>  Hines also credited television coverage of figure skating, which helped to increase popularity of the sport, with the eventual demise of compulsory figures.  Television audiences were not exposed to the compulsory figures segments of competitions, so they did not understand why results contradicted what they saw in free skating segments.<ref name=\"hines2006-205\">Hines (2006), p. 205</ref>  Sports writer Sandra Loosemore agreed, stating that television was \"the driving force\"<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> for the rule changes regarding figures in 1968 and the years following. Figures were not broadcast on television because they were not exciting enough, so viewers \"found it incomprehensible that competitions could be won by skaters who had built up huge leads in the figures portion of the event but gave mediocre performances in the part of the competition shown on TV\".<ref name=\"loosemore\"/>  In 1973, the ISU lowered the value of compulsory figures from 50% to 40% and decreased the number of figures skaters were required to perform.  In 1977, the number of the list of figures skaters could chose to perform decreased even more, down to six figures per competition.<ref name=\"hines2006-205\"/>\n\nLoosemore attributed the decrease in the importance of figures to a \"lack of public accountability\"<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> from the judges of international competitions and other discrepancies in judging, which Loosemore called \"dirty judging\".<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> She speculated that television coverage of the sport, which brought more attention to how it was judged, was also responsible and \"since figures competitions weren't televised, fans could not be certain that the judges were on the level\".<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> Loosemore also speculated that \"the relative scarcity of rinks and practice ice for figures in Europe as compared to North America\"<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> ultimately made the difference in the removal of figures from competitions. Kestnbaum agreed, stating that the elimination of figures was motivated by finances, countries with an affluent middle class or government-supported training for athletes having more of a competitive advantage over less affluent and smaller countries with fewer ice rinks and resources to spend the time necessary to train for proficiency in figures. By the late 1970s and into the 1980s, there were discussions about eliminating them from international competitions.<ref name=\"cultureonice-86\">Kestnbaum, p. 86</ref>\n\nIn 1988, the ISU voted to remove compulsory figures from international single skating competitions, for both men and women, starting in the 1990\u20131991 season. Of 31 voting national associations, only the U.S., Canada, Britain, and New Zealand voted against the decision.<ref name=\"nomorefigures\">{{cite news |title=No More Figures in Figure Skating |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/09/sports/no-more-figures-in-figure-skating.html?pagewanted=print |accessdate=16 November 2019 |work=The New York Times |agency=Associated Press |date=9 June 1988 |page=D00025}}</ref> The last two seasons that compulsory figures were competed at an international competition were in 1989 and 1990; only two figures were skated and they were worth only 20 percent of the competitors' overall scores.<ref name=\"loosemore\"/><ref name=\"cultureonice-86\"/>  [[\u017deljka \u010ci\u017eme\u0161ija]] from Yugoslavia skated the last compulsory figure in international competition, at the [[1990 World Figure Skating Championships|World Championships]] in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], on March 7, 1990.<ref>Hines (2006), p. 235</ref>\n\nCompulsory figures have not been a part of any international or most national competitions since 1990.

The slightest misalignment or shift of body weight could cause errors in the execution of figures.<ref name=\"sausa\"/> American figure skating champion [[Irving Brokaw]] insisted that form was more essential to the production of figures than the tracings themselves because the skater needed to find a comfortable and natural position in which to perform them.<ref name=\"artofskating-19\"/> He expected skaters to trace figures without looking down at them because it gave \"a very slovenly appearance\",<ref name=\"artofskating-19\">Brokaw, p. 19</ref> and recommended that they not use their arms excessively or for balance like tightrope walkers. Brokaw wanted skaters to remain upright and avoid bending over as much as they could. Brokaw also thought that the unemployed leg, which he called the \"balance leg\", was as important as the tracing leg because it was used as much in the execution of a figure as the tracing leg. The balance leg also should be bent only slightly, since he believed bending it too much removed its usefulness and appeared clumsy.<ref>Brokaw, pp. 19\u201320</ref>\n\n[[File:Irving Brokaw skater.jpg|thumb|left|American Olympic figure skater [[Irving Brokaw]], who wrote one of the earliest books about figure skating and compulsory figures, ''The Art of Skating'' (1915)|alt=Man in his 30s, wearing dark trousers and coat, skating on an outdoor rink, facing to the right and looking downward towards the ice]]\n\nWriter Ellyn Kestnbaum noted that skaters who were adept at performing compulsory figures had to practice for hours to have precise body control and to become \"intimately familiar with how subtle shifts in the body's balance over the blade affected the tracings left on the ice\".<ref>Kestnbaum, p. 73</ref> She added that many skaters found figures and their visible results calming and rewarding.<ref name=\"cultureonice-84\">Kestnbaum, p. 84</ref> Sports writer Christie Sausa insisted that training in figures \"helps create better skaters and instills discipline, and can be practiced over a lifetime by skaters of all ages and abilities\".<ref name=\"sausa\"/>  The German magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' declared in 1983 that compulsory figures stifled skaters' creativity because not much about figures had changed in 100 years of competitions.<ref name=\"spiegel\"/>\n\n===Figure elements===\n\nAll compulsory figures had the following: circles, curves, change of foot, change of [[Glossary of figure skating terms#E|edge]], and turns. The circle, the basis of all figures, was performed on both its long and short [[Radical axis|axes]]. Skaters had to trace precise circles, while completing difficult turns and edges.<ref name=\"sausa\"/><ref name=\"specialregs-2\">Special Regs, p. 2</ref> Most figures \"employ specific one-foot turns not done in combination with other one-foot turns\".<ref name=\"hines2006-99\"/>  Each figure consisted of two or three tangent circles. Each circle's [[diameter]] had to be about three times the skater's height, and the [[radii]] of all half-circles and circles had to be approximately the same length. Half-circles and circles had to begin and end as near as possible to the point in which the long and short axes intersected. The figure's long axis divided it longitudinally into equal-sized halves, and the figure's short axes divided the figures into equal-sized lobes.<ref name=\"specialregs-2\"/>\n\nCurves, which are parts of circles, had to be performed with an uninterrupted tracing and with a single clean edge, with no subcurves or wobbles.<ref name=\"specialregs-3\">Special Regs, p. 3</ref> Brokaw insisted that curves had to be done on all four edges of the skate, as well as on the inside and outside edges while skating both backwards and forwards.<ref name=\"artofskating-23\">Brokaw, p. 23</ref> He stated, \"It is the control of these circles that gives strength and power, and the holding of the body in the proper and graceful attitudes, while it is the execution of these large circles, changes of edges, threes and double-threes, brackets, loops, rockers and counters, which makes up the art of skating\".<ref name=\"artofskating-23\"/> Curves also included the forced turn (or [[Bracket turn|bracket]]) and the serpentine.<ref name=\"artofskating-23\"/>\n\nA change of foot, which happened during the short time the skater transferred weight from one foot to the other, was allowed in the execution of figures, but had to be done in a symmetrical zone of each side of the long axis. Skaters could choose the exact point in which they placed their foot in this zone, although it typically was just after the long axis, with the full weight of the body on the skate. It was at this point when the tracing began.<ref name=\"specialregs-2\"/> A change of edge happened at the point in which the long and short axes intersected. Its trace had to be continuously and symmetrically traced and could not be S-shaped. The edge change had to be as short as possible, and could not be longer than the length of the skate blade. Turns were skated with a single clean edge up to and after the turn, but with no double tracings, no skids or scrapes, or no illegal edge change either before, during, or after a turn. The turns' cusps had to be the same size, and the entry into and out of a turn had to be symmetrical.<ref name=\"specialregs-3\"/>\n\nThe simple \"figure eight\" shape was executed by connecting two circles<ref name=\"cultureonice-59\"/> \"about three times the height of the skater with one circle skated on each foot\".<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> The figure eight has four variations: inside edges, outside edges, backward, and forward. A turn added at the halfway point of each circle increased the level of complexity. Other figures included three-lobed figures with a [[counter turn]] or a [[rocker turn]], which were completed at the points where the lobes touched.<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> Counters and rockers had to be executed symmetrically, with no change of edge, with the points of their turns either pointing up or down or lying along the figure's long axis, and could not be beaked or hooked. Brackets, like threes, had to be skated on a circle, its turns' points either pointing up or down or lying along the figure's long axis.<ref name=\"specialregs-3\"/>\n\nSkaters also performed a group of smaller figures called loops.<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> The diameter of the loop's circular shape had to be about the same height of the skater, and they could not have any scrapes or points on the ice. The place in which the skater entered into or exited out of the crossing of both the loop tracing and the center of the loop had to sit on the figure's long axis, where the loop was divided into symmetrical halves. The center of the loop figure to the place in which the skater entered into or exited out of the loop's crossing had to measure five-sixths of the circle's diameter. The loop's length had to be about one-third of the distance from the place in which the skater entered into or exited out of the loop's crossing of the loop tracing to the figure's short axis. The loop's width had to be about two-thirds of its length.<ref name=\"specialregs-3\"/>  The Q figure begins at the tail of the figure, on the skater's outside edge.  It can also begin on any of the four edges, and the direction in which it can be skated can be reversed.  When the circle is skated first, it is called a reverse Q.<ref name=\"hines-34\"/>  Altered forms of the Q figure often do not look like the letter \"q\", but \"simply employ a serpentine line and a three turn\".<ref name=\"hines-34\"/>  United shamrocks, spectacles (shapes that trace the shape of eyeglasses), and united roses are alterations of the basic Q figures.<ref name=\"hines-34\"/>\n\nThere were three types of [[3 turn|three turns]]: the standard three, the double three, and the paragraph double three. The three turn had to be skated on a circle, its turns' points either pointing up or down or lying along the figure's long axis.<ref name=\"specialregs-3\"/><ref name=\"loosemore\"/> For the double three, the points of both threes had to be directed towards the center of each circle, and had to divide the circle into three equal curves. The middle curve had to divide the circles into halves by the figure's long axis.<ref name=\"specialregs-3\"/> The paragraph double three, which was executed at the highest levels of competition, was done by tracing \"two circles with two turns at each circle, all on one foot from one push-off\".<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> The paragraph double three was difficult to accomplish because the shape and placement of the turns had to be perfectly symmetrical, the turns had to be done on a true edge with no scrapes on the ice, and the circles had to be the same size and exactly round.<ref name=\"loosemore\"/>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Figure eight.png|The figure-eight\nFile:Threeturn.GIF|The [[3 turn]]\nFile:Counter.GIF|The [[counter turn]]\nFile:Rocker turn.gif|The [[rocker turn]]\nFile:Bracket.GIF|The [[bracket turn]]\nFile:Loop complusoryfigures.png|The loop\n</gallery>\n\n==Judging==\n\n''Der Spiegel'' compared judging compulsory figures to the work of forensic scientists.<ref name=\"spiegel\">{{cite news |title=Eiskunstlauf: Das Schlimmste |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14020212.html |accessdate=16 November 2019 |work=Der Spiegel |date=7 February 1983 |language=German}}</ref> After the skaters completed tracing figures, the judges scrutinized the circles made, and the process was repeated twice more.

They are the \"circular patterns which skaters trace on the ice to demonstrate skill in placing clean turns evenly on round circles\".<ref name=\"specialregs-1\" /> For approximately the first 50 years of figure skating as a sport, until 1947, compulsory figures made up 60 percent of the total score at most competitions around the world. These figures continued to dominate the sport, although they steadily declined in importance, until the [[International Skating Union]] (ISU) voted to discontinue them as a part of competitions in 1990. Learning and training in compulsory figures instilled discipline and control; some in the figure skating community considered them necessary to teach skaters basic skills. Skaters would train for hours to learn and execute them well, and competing and judging figures would often take up to eight hours during competitions.\n\nSkaters traced compulsory figures, and were judged according to their smoothness and accuracy. The circle is the basis of all figures. Other elements in compulsory figures include curves, change of foot, change of [[Glossary of figure skating terms#E|edge]], and turns. Skaters had to trace precise circles while completing difficult turns and edges. The simple \"figure eight\" shape was executed by connecting two circles; other figures included the [[3 turn|three turn]], the [[counter turn]], the [[rocker turn]], the [[bracket turn]], and the loop.\n\nAlthough few skaters continue to practice compulsory figures, and few coaches still teach them to skaters, some skaters and coaches believe compulsory figures give skaters an advantage in developing alignment, core strength, body control, and discipline. The World Figure Sport Society has conducted festivals and competitions of compulsory figures, endorsed by the [[Ice Skating Institute]], since 2015.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nTracing figures in the ice is the oldest form of figure skating, especially during its first 200 years of existence, when it was a recreational activity practiced mostly by men.  Combined skating, or \"the sophisticated tracing of geometric figures by groups of skaters\", dominated the sport for almost 50 years in England.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 4\u20135</ref>  ''The Art of Skating'', one of the earliest books about figure skating, was written by Robert Jones in 1772 and described five advanced figures, three of which were illustrated with large color plates.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 25\u201325</ref>  Jones' limited body of figures, which emphasized correct technique, were the accepted and basic repertoire of figures in 18th century England.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 27, 62</ref>  The [[Edinburgh Skating Club]], one of the oldest skating clubs in the world, described combined figures and those done by multiple skaters; interlocking figure eights were the most important.<ref>Hines, p. 27</ref>  According to writer Ellyn Kestnbaum, the Edinburgh Skating Club required prospective members to pass proficiency tests in what became compulsory figures.<ref>Kestnbaum, p. 58</ref> The London Skating Club, founded in 1830 in London, also required proficiency tests for members and pioneered combined skating, which contributed to the evolution of school figures.<ref>Kestnbaum, p. 60</ref>  Artistic skating in France, which was derived from the English style of figure skating and was influenced by [[ballet]], developed figures that emphasized artistry, body position, and grace of execution. Jean Garcin, a member of an elite group of skaters in France, wrote a book about figure skating in 1813 that included descriptions and illustrations of over 30 figures, including a series of circle-eight figures that skaters still use today.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 62\u201364</ref>\n\nGeorge Anderson, writing in 1852, described backward-skating figures, including the flying Mercury and the shamrock, as well as the Q figure, which became, in its various forms, an important part of the repertoire of skating movements for the rest of the 1800s.  Anderson also described two combined figures, the salutation (already described by Jones) and the satellite.  By the 1850s, the most important figures (eights, threes, and Qs) were developed, and formed the basis for figure skating at the time.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 30\u201331</ref>  In 1869, Henry Vandervell and T. Maxwell Witham from the London Skating Club wrote ''System of Figure Skating'', which described variations of the three turn (the only figure known before 1860), the bracket (first done on roller skates), the rocker, the Mohawk, the loop, the Q, and other figures.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 31, 32\u201334</ref>  The Mohawk, a two-foot turn on the same circle, most likely originated in North America.<ref name=\"hines-34\">Hines (2006), p. 34</ref>  Figure skating historian James Hines called grapevines, which was probably invented in Canada, \"the most American of all figures\".<ref>Hines (2006), p. 59</ref>  The Viennese style of figure skating, as described by Max Wirth's book in 1881, described connecting figures, which ultimately led to modern free skating programs.<ref>Hines (2006), p. 67</ref>\n\nIn 1868, the American Skating Congress, precursor to [[U.S. Figure Skating]], adopted a series of movements used during competitions between skaters from the U.S. and Canada. Until 1947, for approximately the first 50 years of the existence of figure skating as a sport, compulsory figures made up 60 percent of the total score at most competitions around the world.<ref name=\"loosemore\">{{cite news |last1=Loosemore |first1=Sandra |title='Figures' don't add up in competition anymore |url=http://cbs.sportsline.com/u/women/skating/dec98/loosemore121698.htm |accessdate=16 November 2019 |work=CBS SportsLine |date=16 December 1998|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727021537/http://cbs.sportsline.com/u/women/skating/dec98/loosemore121698.htm |archive-date=2008-07-27 }}</ref>  Other competitions held in the late 19th and early 20th centuries included [[special figures]], freeskating, and compulsories, most of the points they earned going towards how they performed the same set of compulsory moves.<ref>Kestnbaum, pp. 81\u201382</ref> The first international figure skating competition was in Vienna in 1882;<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=https://www.isu.org/isu-history |publisher=International Skating Union |accessdate=16 November 2019}}</ref><ref>Hines (2011), p. xx</ref> according to Kestnbaum, it established a precedent for future competitions.<ref name=\"cultureonice-67\"/> Skaters were required to perform 23 compulsory figures, as well as a four-minute freeskating program, and a section called \"special figures\", in which they had to perform moves or combinations of moves that highlighted their advanced skills.<ref name=\"cultureonice-67\">Kestnbaum, p. 67</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-C0110-0014-001, Gabriele Seyfert, Ralph Borghardt.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ralph Borghardt]] and [[Gabriele Seyfert]] examine the print of a loop figure at the 1964 [[East German Figure Skating Championships|East German Championships]].|alt=Man on the left and woman on the right crouching on a piece of ice on a rink, the man tracing a figure on the ice with his thumb]]\n\nCompulsory figures were an important part of figure skating for the rest of the 19th century until the 1930s and 1940s. The first [[1891 European Figure Skating Championships|European Championships in 1891]] consisted of only compulsory figures.<ref>Hines (2011), p. 12</ref> In 1896, the newly formed [[International Skating Union]] (ISU) sponsored the [[1896 World Figure Skating Championships|first annual World Figure Skating Championships]] in St. Petersburg. The competition consisted of compulsory figures and freeskating.<ref>Kestnbaum, p. 68</ref> Skaters had to perform six compulsory moves, or figures, so that judges could compare skaters according to an established standard. Compulsory figures were worth 60 percent of the competitors' total scores. Special figures were not included in World Championships, although they were included as a separate discipline in other competitions, including the [[1908 Summer Olympics|Olympics in 1908]].<ref name=\"cultureonice-82\"/>\n\nIn 1897, the ISU adopted a schedule of 41 school figures, each of increasing difficulty, which were proposed by the British. They remained the standard compulsory figures used throughout the world in proficiency testing and competitions until 1990, and U.S. Figure Skating continued to use them as a separate discipline in the 1990s. After [[World War II]], more countries were sending skaters to international competitions, so the ISU cut the numbers of figures to a maximum of six due to the extended time it took to judge them all.<ref name=\"cultureonice-82\"/><ref name=\"loosemore\"/>\n\n===Demise===\nCompulsory figures began to be progressively devalued in 1967, when the values of both compulsory figures and free skating were changed to 50 percent.<ref>Hines (2006), p. 197</ref> In 1973, the number of figures was decreased from six to three, and their overall weight was decreased to 30 percent, to make room for the introduction of the [[Short program (figure skating)|short program]].<ref name=\"loosemore\"/><ref name=\"nomorefigures\"/>  Hines stated that the decrease in the importance of compulsory figures was due to \"the unbalanced skating\"<ref name=\"hines2006-204\">Hines, (2006), p. 204</ref> of women skaters such as [[Trixi Schuba|Beatrix \"Trixi\" Schuba]] of Austria, who Hines called \"the last great practitioner of compulsory figures\".<ref name=\"hines2006-204\"/>  Schuba won several medals in the late 1960s and early 1970s based upon the strength of her figures, despite her lower results in free skating.  As Hines stated, \"she could not be defeated under a scoring system that gave preference to figures\".<ref name=\"hines2006-204\"/>  Hines also credited television coverage of figure skating, which helped to increase popularity of the sport, with the eventual demise of compulsory figures.  Television audiences were not exposed to the compulsory figures segments of competitions, so they did not understand why results contradicted what they saw in free skating segments.<ref name=\"hines2006-205\">Hines (2006), p. 205</ref>  Sports writer Sandra Loosemore agreed, stating that television was \"the driving force\"<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> for the rule changes regarding figures in 1968 and the years following. Figures were not broadcast on television because they were not exciting enough, so viewers \"found it incomprehensible that competitions could be won by skaters who had built up huge leads in the figures portion of the event but gave mediocre performances in the part of the competition shown on TV\".<ref name=\"loosemore\"/>  In 1973, the ISU lowered the value of compulsory figures from 50% to 40% and decreased the number of figures skaters were required to perform.  In 1977, the number of the list of figures skaters could chose to perform decreased even more, down to six figures per competition.<ref name=\"hines2006-205\"/>\n\nLoosemore attributed the decrease in the importance of figures to a \"lack of public accountability\"<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> from the judges of international competitions and other discrepancies in judging, which Loosemore called \"dirty judging\".<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> She speculated that television coverage of the sport, which brought more attention to how it was judged, was also responsible and \"since figures competitions weren't televised, fans could not be certain that the judges were on the level\".<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> Loosemore also speculated that \"the relative scarcity of rinks and practice ice for figures in Europe as compared to North America\"<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> ultimately made the difference in the removal of figures from competitions. Kestnbaum agreed, stating that the elimination of figures was motivated by finances, countries with an affluent middle class or government-supported training for athletes having more of a competitive advantage over less affluent and smaller countries with fewer ice rinks and resources to spend the time necessary to train for proficiency in figures. By the late 1970s and into the 1980s, there were discussions about eliminating them from international competitions.<ref name=\"cultureonice-86\">Kestnbaum, p. 86</ref>\n\nIn 1988, the ISU voted to remove compulsory figures from international single skating competitions, for both men and women, starting in the 1990\u20131991 season. Of 31 voting national associations, only the U.S., Canada, Britain, and New Zealand voted against the decision.<ref name=\"nomorefigures\">{{cite news |title=No More Figures in Figure Skating |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/09/sports/no-more-figures-in-figure-skating.html?pagewanted=print |accessdate=16 November 2019 |work=The New York Times |agency=Associated Press |date=9 June 1988 |page=D00025}}</ref> The last two seasons that compulsory figures were competed at an international competition were in 1989 and 1990; only two figures were skated and they were worth only 20 percent of the competitors' overall scores.<ref name=\"loosemore\"/><ref name=\"cultureonice-86\"/>  [[\u017deljka \u010ci\u017eme\u0161ija]] from Yugoslavia skated the last compulsory figure in international competition, at the [[1990 World Figure Skating Championships|World Championships]] in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], on March 7, 1990.<ref>Hines (2006), p. 235</ref>\n\nCompulsory figures have not been a part of any international or most national competitions since 1990.

The slightest misalignment or shift of body weight could cause errors in the execution of figures.<ref name=\"sausa\"/> American figure skating champion [[Irving Brokaw]] insisted that form was more essential to the production of figures than the tracings themselves because the skater needed to find a comfortable and natural position in which to perform them.<ref name=\"artofskating-19\"/> He expected skaters to trace figures without looking down at them because it gave \"a very slovenly appearance\",<ref name=\"artofskating-19\">Brokaw, p. 19</ref> and recommended that they not use their arms excessively or for balance like tightrope walkers. Brokaw wanted skaters to remain upright and avoid bending over as much as they could. Brokaw also thought that the unemployed leg, which he called the \"balance leg\", was as important as the tracing leg because it was used as much in the execution of a figure as the tracing leg. The balance leg also should be bent only slightly, since he believed bending it too much removed its usefulness and appeared clumsy.<ref>Brokaw, pp. 19\u201320</ref>\n\n[[File:Irving Brokaw skater.jpg|thumb|left|American Olympic figure skater [[Irving Brokaw]], who wrote one of the earliest books about figure skating and compulsory figures, ''The Art of Skating'' (1915)|alt=Man in his 30s, wearing dark trousers and coat, skating on an outdoor rink, facing to the right and looking downward towards the ice]]\n\nWriter Ellyn Kestnbaum noted that skaters who were adept at performing compulsory figures had to practice for hours to have precise body control and to become \"intimately familiar with how subtle shifts in the body's balance over the blade affected the tracings left on the ice\".<ref>Kestnbaum, p. 73</ref> She added that many skaters found figures and their visible results calming and rewarding.<ref name=\"cultureonice-84\">Kestnbaum, p. 84</ref> Sports writer Christie Sausa insisted that training in figures \"helps create better skaters and instills discipline, and can be practiced over a lifetime by skaters of all ages and abilities\".<ref name=\"sausa\"/>  The German magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' declared in 1983 that compulsory figures stifled skaters' creativity because not much about figures had changed in 100 years of competitions.<ref name=\"spiegel\"/>\n\n===Figure elements===\n\nAll compulsory figures had the following: circles, curves, change of foot, change of [[Glossary of figure skating terms#E|edge]], and turns. The circle, the basis of all figures, was performed on both its long and short [[Radical axis|axes]]. Skaters had to trace precise circles, while completing difficult turns and edges.<ref name=\"sausa\"/><ref name=\"specialregs-2\">Special Regs, p. 2</ref> Most figures \"employ specific one-foot turns not done in combination with other one-foot turns\".<ref name=\"hines2006-99\"/>  Each figure consisted of two or three tangent circles. Each circle's [[diameter]] had to be about three times the skater's height, and the [[radii]] of all half-circles and circles had to be approximately the same length. Half-circles and circles had to begin and end as near as possible to the point in which the long and short axes intersected. The figure's long axis divided it longitudinally into equal-sized halves, and the figure's short axes divided the figures into equal-sized lobes.<ref name=\"specialregs-2\"/>\n\nCurves, which are parts of circles, had to be performed with an uninterrupted tracing and with a single clean edge, with no subcurves or wobbles.<ref name=\"specialregs-3\">Special Regs, p. 3</ref> Brokaw insisted that curves had to be done on all four edges of the skate, as well as on the inside and outside edges while skating both backwards and forwards.<ref name=\"artofskating-23\">Brokaw, p. 23</ref> He stated, \"It is the control of these circles that gives strength and power, and the holding of the body in the proper and graceful attitudes, while it is the execution of these large circles, changes of edges, threes and double-threes, brackets, loops, rockers and counters, which makes up the art of skating\".<ref name=\"artofskating-23\"/> Curves also included the forced turn (or [[Bracket turn|bracket]]) and the serpentine.<ref name=\"artofskating-23\"/>\n\nA change of foot, which happened during the short time the skater transferred weight from one foot to the other, was allowed in the execution of figures, but had to be done in a symmetrical zone of each side of the long axis. Skaters could choose the exact point in which they placed their foot in this zone, although it typically was just after the long axis, with the full weight of the body on the skate. It was at this point when the tracing began.<ref name=\"specialregs-2\"/> A change of edge happened at the point in which the long and short axes intersected. Its trace had to be continuously and symmetrically traced and could not be S-shaped. The edge change had to be as short as possible, and could not be longer than the length of the skate blade. Turns were skated with a single clean edge up to and after the turn, but with no double tracings, no skids or scrapes, or no illegal edge change either before, during, or after a turn. The turns' cusps had to be the same size, and the entry into and out of a turn had to be symmetrical.<ref name=\"specialregs-3\"/>\n\nThe simple \"figure eight\" shape was executed by connecting two circles<ref name=\"cultureonice-59\"/> \"about three times the height of the skater with one circle skated on each foot\".<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> The figure eight has four variations: inside edges, outside edges, backward, and forward. A turn added at the halfway point of each circle increased the level of complexity. Other figures included three-lobed figures with a [[counter turn]] or a [[rocker turn]], which were completed at the points where the lobes touched.<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> Counters and rockers had to be executed symmetrically, with no change of edge, with the points of their turns either pointing up or down or lying along the figure's long axis, and could not be beaked or hooked. Brackets, like threes, had to be skated on a circle, its turns' points either pointing up or down or lying along the figure's long axis.<ref name=\"specialregs-3\"/>\n\nSkaters also performed a group of smaller figures called loops.<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> The diameter of the loop's circular shape had to be about the same height of the skater, and they could not have any scrapes or points on the ice. The place in which the skater entered into or exited out of the crossing of both the loop tracing and the center of the loop had to sit on the figure's long axis, where the loop was divided into symmetrical halves. The center of the loop figure to the place in which the skater entered into or exited out of the loop's crossing had to measure five-sixths of the circle's diameter. The loop's length had to be about one-third of the distance from the place in which the skater entered into or exited out of the loop's crossing of the loop tracing to the figure's short axis. The loop's width had to be about two-thirds of its length.<ref name=\"specialregs-3\"/>  The Q figure begins at the tail of the figure, on the skater's outside edge.  It can also begin on any of the four edges, and the direction in which it can be skated can be reversed.  When the circle is skated first, it is called a reverse Q.<ref name=\"hines-34\"/>  Altered forms of the Q figure often do not look like the letter \"q\", but \"simply employ a serpentine line and a three turn\".<ref name=\"hines-34\"/>  United shamrocks, spectacles (shapes that trace the shape of eyeglasses), and united roses are alterations of the basic Q figures.<ref name=\"hines-34\"/>\n\nThere were three types of [[3 turn|three turns]]: the standard three, the double three, and the paragraph double three. The three turn had to be skated on a circle, its turns' points either pointing up or down or lying along the figure's long axis.<ref name=\"specialregs-3\"/><ref name=\"loosemore\"/> For the double three, the points of both threes had to be directed towards the center of each circle, and had to divide the circle into three equal curves. The middle curve had to divide the circles into halves by the figure's long axis.<ref name=\"specialregs-3\"/> The paragraph double three, which was executed at the highest levels of competition, was done by tracing \"two circles with two turns at each circle, all on one foot from one push-off\".<ref name=\"loosemore\"/> The paragraph double three was difficult to accomplish because the shape and placement of the turns had to be perfectly symmetrical, the turns had to be done on a true edge with no scrapes on the ice, and the circles had to be the same size and exactly round.<ref name=\"loosemore\"/>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Figure eight.png|The figure-eight\nFile:Threeturn.GIF|The [[3 turn]]\nFile:Counter.GIF|The [[counter turn]]\nFile:Rocker turn.gif|The [[rocker turn]]\nFile:Bracket.GIF|The [[bracket turn]]\nFile:Loop complusoryfigures.png|The loop\n</gallery>\n\n==Judging==\n\n''Der Spiegel'' compared judging compulsory figures to the work of forensic scientists.<ref name=\"spiegel\">{{cite news |title=Eiskunstlauf: Das Schlimmste |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14020212.html |accessdate=16 November 2019 |work=Der Spiegel |date=7 February 1983 |language=German}}</ref> After the skaters completed tracing figures, the judges scrutinized the circles made, and the process was repeated twice more.

McGregor had success with his bodywork, but Diaz began to land combinations of his own. After a stiff one-two from Diaz, McGregor seemed fatigued and troubled by the shots. He attempted a [[takedown (grappling)#Double leg takedown|double leg takedown]], which Diaz successfully defended by [[sprawl (grappling)|sprawling]].

After a McGregor combination in the first round, Diaz returned fire with two consecutive hooks, one a slap, a signature of Nate and his brother, [[Nick Diaz]], termed the \"Stockton Slap\". McGregor avoided Diaz's jabs by slipping to his right, often before throwing his left overhand. The second round commenced with Diaz using his check right hook, attempting to keep the aggressive McGregor at distance. McGregor had success with his bodywork, but Diaz began to land combinations of his own. After a stiff one-two from Diaz, McGregor seemed fatigued and troubled by the shots. He attempted a [[takedown (grappling)#Double leg takedown|double leg takedown]], which Diaz successfully defended by [[sprawl (grappling)|sprawling]]. Diaz then threatened the [[guillotine choke]], which forced McGregor onto his back after stopping McGregor from scrambling out of the position as he had during the bout with [[Chad Mendes]] at [[UFC 189]]. Diaz secured the [[mount (grappling)|mount]], before firing off a volley of strikes from the top. In an effort to avoid the assault, McGregor gave up his back, and Diaz secured a [[rear naked choke]].

Rice''' (June 11, 1922 \u2013 February 25, 2017) was an American [[Health Statistics|health statistician]] whose work contributed to the creation of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] in the United States. Rice graduated from the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] and began working with the US government soon after, but left the workforce to begin raising a child. Just over a decade later, she returned to government work with a position at the [[Social Security Administration]], where she was one of the first scientists to study the economic cost of illness and exposed a lack of health insurance among the elderly.\n\nRice was later the director of the [[National Center for Health Statistics]] from 1976 to 1982, where she helped create the [[National Death Index]].

Rice''' (June 11, 1922 \u2013 February 25, 2017) was an American [[Health Statistics|health statistician]] whose work contributed to the creation of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] in the United States. Rice graduated from the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] and began working with the US government soon after, but left the workforce to begin raising a child. Just over a decade later, she returned to government work with a position at the [[Social Security Administration]], where she was one of the first scientists to study the economic cost of illness and exposed a lack of health insurance among the elderly.\n\nRice was later the director of the [[National Center for Health Statistics]] from 1976 to 1982, where she helped create the [[National Death Index]]. She finished her career at the [[University of California, San Francisco]], where she was a Regents' lecturer and professor emeritus.

After completing ''[[Infamous First Light]]'', the team wanted to develop another open world project because they believed that choices made by the player are important to gameplay. As a result, the game will not feature [[waypoint]]s and players will have complete freedom to explore the game's world. According to Nate Fox, the game's director, the team distilled the game's numerous internal pitches into \"the fantasy of becoming a samurai\" during conceptualization.<ref name=\"waypoint\"/> To ensure that the title would be an accurate representation of feudal Japan, Sucker Punch consulted cultural experts and sent an audio team to Japan to record different sounds, including [[birdsongs]]. Players will be able to switch to Japanese dialogue with English subtitles.<ref>{{cite

After completing ''[[Infamous First Light]]'', the team wanted to develop another open world project because they believed that choices made by the player are important to gameplay. As a result, the game will not feature [[waypoint]]s and players will have complete freedom to explore the game's world. According to Nate Fox, the game's director, the team distilled the game's numerous internal pitches into \"the fantasy of becoming a samurai\" during conceptualization.<ref name=\"waypoint\"/> To ensure that the title would be an accurate representation of feudal Japan, Sucker Punch consulted cultural experts and sent an audio team to Japan to record different sounds, including [[birdsongs]].

While at college he became involved in amateur dramatics in Manchester, making his professional stage debut on graduation, aged 23. In 1967, he made his [[London]] [[West End theatre]] debut at the [[Aldwych Theatre]]. Later, he was spotted by music producer and manager [[Dick James]], who offered to mould Kingsley into a pop star, but Kingsley chose to join the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] after an audition before [[Trevor Nunn]].\n\nDevoting himself almost exclusively to stage work for the next 15 years, he made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in 1971 with the RSC. Kingsley played Mosca in [[Peter Hall (theatre director)|Peter Hall]]'s 1977 production of Ben Jonson's ''[[Volpone]]'' for the [[Royal National Theatre]], and in [[Peter Brook]]'s acclaimed production of ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''. At about this time, he changed his name to Ben Kingsley, fearing that a foreign name would hamper his career.<ref name=\"actors\">Stated in interview on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]''</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/1734960.stm \"Sir Ben's Sexy honour\"], BBC News. 31 December 2001.</ref> He also starred in the role of [[Willy Loman]] in a 1982 [[Sydney]] production of ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' opposite [[Mel Gibson]].\n\n===Film and television===\nKingsley made the transition to film roles early on, with his first role coming in ''[[Fear Is the Key (film)|Fear Is the Key]]'', released in 1972. Kingsley continued starring in bit roles in both film and television, including a role as Ron Jenkins on the soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]'' from 1966 to 1967 and regular appearances as a defence counsel in the long-running British legal programme ''[[Crown Court (TV series)|Crown Court]]''. In 1975, he starred as [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] in the BBCs historical drama ''[[The Love School]]'' and appeared in the TV miniseries ''[[Dickens of London]]'' the following year. He found fame as [[Mahatma Gandhi|Mohandas Gandhi]] in the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning film ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' in 1982. The film was a critical and financial success, and Kingsley won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his performance.<ref name=\"actors\"/> At the time, it was claimed that some people thought it was wrong that \"white\"  British actor Ben Kingsley should \"brownup\" to play Gandhi, not realising he was actually of Indian heritage.\n\nKingsley has since appeared in a variety of roles. His credits included the films ''[[Turtle Diary]]'', ''[[Maurice (film)|Maurice]]'', ''[[Pascali's Island (film)|Pascali's Island]]'', ''[[Without a Clue]]'' (as [[Dr. Watson]] alongside [[Michael Caine]]'s [[Sherlock Holmes]]), ''[[Suspect Zero]]'', ''[[Bugsy]]'' (nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]), ''[[Sneakers (1992 film)|Sneakers]]'', ''[[Dave (film)|Dave]]'', ''[[Searching for Bobby Fischer]]'', ''[[Schindler's List]]'', ''[[Silas Marner]]'', ''[[Death and the Maiden (1994 film)|Death and the Maiden]]'', ''[[Sexy Beast]]'', for which he received another Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and ''[[House of Sand and Fog (film)|House of Sand and Fog]]'', which led to an Oscar nomination for Best Actor.

{"title_page": "Development of stadiums in English football", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2018}}\nA large number of English football clubs have ongoing schemes to redevelop existing grounds, or to move to newly constructed stadiums. A trend towards all-seater stadiums was initially prescribed by the [[Taylor Report]], and was originally a condition only of [[Premier League]] admission. It has now become a requirement that within three years of a club's first promotion to [[Football League Championship|the Championship]] all paying spectators are seated, even if the club is subsequently relegated. This page provides an (incomplete) list and description of those clubs who have planned new stadiums or refurbishments, or who have already moved/refurbished since around the time of the Taylor Report.\n\nThe following list includes clubs that are based in [[Wales]] but play in the [[English football league system]].\n\n==History==\nWhen [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] moved to [[Glanford Park]] in 1988, it was the first time a [[The Football League|Football League]] club had moved to a new purpose-built home since 1956.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/chesters-grounds-for-hope-built-in-just-30-weeks-the-deva-stadium-has-allowed-frustrated-fans-to-welcome-their-team-home-from-exile-1542436.html|title=Chester's grounds for hope|newspaper=The Independent|date=25 August 1992|accessdate=19 May 2010|location=London|first=Phil|last=Shaw}}</ref> Up to this point, most sides were playing in grounds that had been largely structurally unchanged for most of the 20th century. One of the few clubs to play in a completely rebuilt post [[World War II]] stadium was [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], whose stadium had been rebuilt due to bomb damage during the war, and significantly altered in the 1960s and again in the early 1980s.\n\nGround improvements were seldom, most clubs rarely reached their capacity on a regular basis, and poor facilities were commonplace \u2013 this particularly being the case between 1979 and 1986, when attendances fell, with this fall in spectators being blamed largely on increased [[Football hooliganism|hooliganism]], as well as the [[Early 1980s recession|economic downturn]] and sharp rise in unemployment that occurred in the early 1980s. The main source of income came from gate receipts, and most additional money was spent on transfers. It was not until the growing concern in the 1980s about the safety of existing stadiums, that clubs began to examine the possibilities offered by redeveloping their grounds. This was first highlighted in May 1985, when 56 fans were burnt to death [[Bradford City stadium fire|in a fire]] at the [[Bradford City F.C.|Bradford City]] stadium, and even more so in the aftermath of the [[Hillsborough disaster]] of April 1989, which led to the death of 96 [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] fans at an [[FA Cup]] semi-final. Poor maintenance was seen as the main reason for the fire at Bradford, while the presence of perimeter fencing and standing areas (as well as loss of police control) were seen as the main factors in the Hillsborough tragedy.\n\nIn January 1990, the [[Taylor Report]] recommended the conversion of all [[Football League]] stadiums to all-seater arenas<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballnetwork.org/dev/communityfootball/violence_taylor_report.asp |title=The Taylor Report |publisher=Footballnetwork.org |date=15 April 1989 |accessdate=13 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415180944/http://www.footballnetwork.org/dev/communityfootball/violence_taylor_report.asp |archivedate=15 April 2008 }}</ref> although this was subsequently applied just to the top two levels with effect from the [[1994-95 in English football|1994\u201395 season]]. The report had ordered third and fourth tier teams to follow suit by 1999, but clubs at this level were allowed to continue with standing accommodation.\n\nThis was given governmental financial assistance, and while unpopular with many fans, attendances began to rise again in the 1990s.\n\nThe new all-seater arrangement tended to be more popular with both the clubs and football authorities, as they had the combined benefits of being safer and more profitable.\n\nThe boom in television rights following the creation of the [[Premier League]] in 1992 allowed a number of clubs to further expand their stadiums, or even move to new ones. Realising the commercial possibilities of new stadiums, many ambitious outfits constructed purpose-built stadiums often on the outskirts of cities or in urban regeneration areas. It has become common for clubs to tie these new stadiums in with residential or leisure complexes.\n\nA number of lower-league clubs had plans for ground improvements halted following the collapse of [[ITV Digital]] and the lucrative broadcasting contract they had agreed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1896732.stm |title=BUSINESS &#124; ITV Digital goes broke |work=BBC News |date=27 March 2002 |accessdate=14 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1961343.stm |title=BUSINESS &#124; The fallout from ITV Digital's collapse |work=BBC News |date=1 May 2002 |accessdate=14 April 2010}}</ref> Following the re-sale of rights, a number of these programmes have been re-activated in recent years, and some of the heaviest stadium redevelopment has been in the lower divisions. Most teams with ambitions of eventual promotion to the Premier League have plans for continued work on their grounds to bring them up to an appropriate standard. Even the biggest clubs have been affected, [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] have heavily rebuilt and expanded [[Old Trafford]] since 1992, while [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] moved to the [[Emirates Stadium]] in 2006.\n\nIn 2015, every stadium in England have to adhere to Accessible Stadia guideline, which each clubs are required to have a certain minimum number of amenity and easy access spaces with accessible toilets.

These seats were removed when the club was relegated to the bottom tier in 2008 but installed once more following promotion back to League One in 2010. Following promotion to the [[Sky Bet Championship]] in 2013 the club installed a larger, roofed temporary stand, bringing the total ground capacity just shy of 12,000. This was named after club legend, the [[Ted MacDougall]] Stand. After a successful debut [[Premier League]] campaign, the club submitted a planning application to Bournemouth Borough Council to redevelop the temporary Ted MacDougall Stand with a much larger one which would take the capacity of the ground to 14,529.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.afcb.co.uk/news/article/south-stand-afc-bournemouth-stadium-expansion-plans-3012635.aspx|title=South Stand: See the full plans for AFC Bournemouth's potential South Stand development|last=afcb.co.uk|access-date=19 January 2017}}</ref> However these plans have been put on hold and just nine months later the club announced that they were seeking a new site on which to build a new stadium, with a view to being ready for the 2020/21 season.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.afcb.co.uk/news/article/2016-17/club-statement-afc-bournemouth-vitality-stadium-3459607.aspx|title=Club statement: AFC Bournemouth chief executive Neill Blake makes statement on Vitality Stadium|last=afcb.co.uk|access-date=19 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Arsenal===\n\n* Stadium: [[Emirates Stadium]]\n* Capacity: 60,704<ref name=\":0\" />\n*''Current stadium status'': New.\n[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] moved to the [[Emirates Stadium]] in 2006, which has massively boosted club income.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/7009944.stm |title=BBC SPORT &#124; Football &#124; My Club &#124; Arsenal &#124; Arsenal bullish over \u00a3200m income |work=BBC News |date=24 September 2007 |accessdate=14 April 2010}}</ref> At present, the capacity is 60,355 (seated), with currently no public plans to expand it despite strong average attendances of 60,025 in the Premier League.

However, this was deemed inadequate by 1998 and led to the club's directors deciding that relocation was necessary, prompting the club to build a new stadium, with the site at Ashburton Grove being selected in November 1999 (after a bid to buy [[Wembley Stadium]] failed) and work beginning in the spring of 2004.

This has been done by filling in all four corners of the stadium and adding an extra tier to the top of the East Stand. Extra corporate boxes and hospitality suites have also been added to the existing South Stand mezzanine, and the 1901 Club West Stand middle tier has been extended around each corner.\n\nBrighton had been without a permanent home since May 1997, when they left the [[Goldstone Ground]] after 95 years after it was sold to a developer in an effort to ease the club's financial crisis.

The venture was a tri-partide one with Huddersfield Town, [[Huddersfield Giants]] Rugby league club and Kirklees Metropolitan Council being shareholders in a 40:20:40 ratio with a company called KSDL.

There is potential for further expansion of the capacity by adding a 2nd tier to the East Stand but no plans are being considered as yet.

After chairman Reg Burr decided that it would not be viable to redevelop The Old Den as an all-seater stadium, he announced in 1990 that the club would relocate to a new stadium in the Senegal Fields area in south Bermondsey. Originally, it was planned to have a seating capacity of between 25,000 and 30,000, however, the club opted to wait so the capacity was kept to just over 20,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.millwall-history.org.uk/the_den5.htm|title=Moving On: The New Den|website=www.millwall-history.org.uk}}</ref>\n\nMillwall played their final game at The Old Den on 8 May 1993 after 83 years and then moved to the new stadium a quarter-of-a-mile away from Cold Blow Lane. The \u00a316 million New Den was opened by [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]], the leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and of [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|the Opposition]] at the time, on 4 August 1993 prior to a prestigious friendly against [[Sporting Clube de Portugal|Sporting Portugal]], which Sporting won 2\u20131. The Den was the first new stadium constructed for a professional football team in London since 1937.\n\nIn September 2016 [[Lewisham London Borough Council|Lewisham Council]] approved a [[compulsory purchase order]] of land surrounding The Den rented by Millwall, as part of a major redevelopment of the \"New Bermondsey\" area. The plans are controversial because the developer, Renewal, is controlled by [[Offshore company|offshore companies]] with unclear ownership, and is seen by the club and local community to be profiteering by demolishing existing homes and businesses as well as Millwall's car-park & the highly acclaimed and well recognised Millwall Community Trust \u2013 to build up to 2,400 new private homes, with no council housing and less than 15% of 'affordable housing'.

In the late 1990s the club submitted a planning application for a new stadium on the western outskirts of Grimsby at [[Great Coates]], adjacent to the [[A180 road (England)|A180 dual carriageway]]. The provisionally titled Conoco Stadium was to be funded by a partnership with a major retailer and would be built with a capacity of 14,000 that could be expanded up to 21,000 (to meet Premier League requirements) in a matter of weeks by building the entire structure of the stadium but not installing any facilities or seats in the four corners of the stadium until they were required.\n\nThe new stadium would have included facilities to match the best Premier League clubs including a substantial increase in match-day hospitality areas, more [[Luxury box|corporate boxes]] of a far higher standard, more cafe and bar areas including for away supporters, significantly more toilets, larger and more versatile player dressing rooms, wider seats with more legroom, a hard-wearing hybrid pitch capable of withstanding multiple rugby and football matches being played on it every week and facilities that could be used throughout the year for corporate events.\n\nThe aim was to open the new stadium for the start of the 2001/2002 season. After considerable opposition to the plans from local residents delayed the project, the new stadium received planning permission from [[North East Lincolnshire Council]] in November 2000. The [[Government Office|Government Office for Yorkshire and the Humber]] approved the plan in February 2002, [[Conoco]] agreed naming rights to the stadium in April 2002 and the revised opening date was set for the start of the 2003/2004 season. At the end of 2002 retailers [[Woolworths Group|Woolworths]] and [[B&Q]] pulled out of the scheme and opening was set back again to the 2005/2006 season.

This would make the fish docks site less desirable as it could limit the regeneration of the fishing industry and the regeneration opportunities of the Freeman Street site more attractive to government as it considers funding.\n\nAt the end of December 2019 the leader of the council stated that regeneration of the Freeman Street area with a new stadium on it was \"top of his wish list for 2020\".<ref>https://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/news/grimsby-news/freeman-street-top-leaders-wish-3675684</ref>\n\n=== Leyton Orient ===\n\n*Stadium: [[Brisbane Road|The Breyer Group Stadium]]\n* Capacity: 9,271<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.efl.com/clubs-and-competitions/sky-bet-league-two/clubs/leyton-orient/|title=EFL Official Website - Leyton Orient|website=www.efl.com|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref>\n* ''Current stadium status'': Reconstructed.\n\n=== Macclesfield Town ===\n\n*Stadium: [[Moss Rose]]\n* Capacity: 6,355<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.efl.com/clubs-and-competitions/sky-bet-league-two/clubs/macclesfield-town/|title=EFL Official Website - Macclesfield Town|website=www.efl.com|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref>\n* ''Current stadium status'': Reconstructed.\n\n=== Mansfield Town ===\n\n*Stadium: [[Field Mill|One Call Stadium]]\n* Capacity: 9,186<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.efl.com/clubs-and-competitions/sky-bet-league-two/clubs/mansfield-town/|title=EFL Official Website - Mansfield Town|website=www.efl.com|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref>\n* ''Current stadium status'': Reconstructed.\n\n===Morecambe===\n\n*Stadium: [[Globe Arena (football stadium)|Globe Arena]]\n* Capacity: 6,476<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.efl.com/clubs-and-competitions/sky-bet-league-two/clubs/morecambe/|title=EFL Official Website - Morecambe|website=www.efl.com|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref>\n*''Current stadium status'': New.\n\n[[Morecambe F.C.|Morecambe]] moved from its previous ground at [[Christie Park (Morecambe, England)|Christie Park]] to [[Globe Arena (football stadium)|The Globe Arena]] at the start of the [[2010-11 Football League|2010\u201311 season]].<ref name=\"mns\">{{cite web |url=http://www.morecambestadium.co.uk/ |title=WELCOME TO THE FUTURE \u2013 Globe Arena &#124; Morecambe new ground &#124; Globe Construction &#124; new ground stadium Morecambe &#124; Morecambe regeneration &#124; Westgate developm |publisher=Morecambe Stadium |accessdate=14 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212043206/http://www.morecambestadium.co.uk/ |archive-date=12 February 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The ground has a capacity of 6000, comprising 2000 seats and 4000 standing spaces.<ref name=\"mns\" />\n\n=== Newport County ===\n\n*Stadium: [[Rodney Parade]]\n* Capacity: 8,700<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.efl.com/clubs-and-competitions/sky-bet-league-two/clubs/newport-county/|title=EFL Official Website - Newport County|website=www.efl.com|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref>\n* ''Current stadium status'': Reconstructed.\n\n=== Northampton Town ===\n\n*Stadium: [[Sixfields Stadium|Sixfields]]\n* Capacity: 7,798<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.efl.com/clubs-and-competitions/sky-bet-league-two/clubs/northampton-town/|title=EFL Official Website - Northampton Town|website=www.efl.com|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref>\n*''Current stadium status'': New.\n\n===Oldham Athletic===\n\n*Stadium: [[Boundary Park]]\n* Capacity: 13,513<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.efl.com/clubs-and-competitions/sky-bet-league-two/clubs/oldham-athletic/|title=EFL Official Website - Oldham Athletic|website=www.efl.com|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref>\n*''Current stadium status'': Reconstructed.\n\n[[Boundary Park]] has been all-seater stadium since the mid-1990s, though the improvements were very much a task of refurbishment rather than reconstruction.  The only reconstruction happened at the Rochdale Road End of the ground where the old traditional open terrace was replaced by a 4,600 capacity all seated stand.  The Chadderton Road End on the opposite side of the ground simply had seats bolted onto the terrace, whilst the Main Stand and Broadway Stand had seats added to the lower tiers of the stand.\n\nThere were plans in the late 1990s for a move to a new 20,000 all seater stadium on adjoining waste ground, but these were scrapped.\n\nBecause of these problems, the club announced in the summer of 2009 that it was considering moving to a new stadium in Failsworth.  However, the Charities Commission later turned down the application.\n\nOn 28 July 2011 Oldham Metropolitan Borough Council offered the club \u00a35.7 million to help with their redevelopment fund of Boundary Park, which would involve the redevelopment of the Broadway Stand.\n\nPlanning approval for the new North Stand was confirmed in April 2013, including a 2,671 capacity stand, a health and fitness suite, supporters' bar and event facilities.  Demolition and preparatory work started in the summer of 2013.\nConstruction of the new North Stand is still ongoing, although the seating area in the stand was open for use on 17 October 2015 for the home match against Sheffield United.  The new North Stand is significantly taller than the stand that it replaced although the capacity for supporters is roughly the same, bringing the ground capacity up to 13,512.

The first stage of reconstruction at the ground took place in 2001, with the replacement of 3 stands with an all-seater horseshoe-shaped stand. Following the construction, the club then planned to rebuild the main grandstand. This initially did not materialize, and following the financial crisis at the club in 2010 and 2011, future stadium plans were put on hold.\n\nAfter [[Plymouth Argyle]] went into administration, the club was taken over by local business owner James Brent, and fresh plans for a new Mayflower Grandstand were submitted to [[Plymouth City Council]]. The plans included the stand itself, as well as a new 1500-seat-capacity ice rink, 10-screen cinema and a hotel that would provide funds for the club. The plans received planning permission on 15 August 2013, with Brent suggesting that development could begin immediately. The old grandstand was planned to be demolished in late October 2013, but was put on hold after rival plans for similar leisure facilities at Bretonside were approved.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/new-plan-home-park-grandstand-cinema-deal/story-26859816-detail/story.html|title=New plan for Home Park grandstand as cinema deal 'scuppered'|date=8 July 2015|accessdate=22 December 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909184918/http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/New-plan-Home-Park-grandstand-cinema-deal/story-26859816-detail/story.html|archive-date=9 September 2015|publisher=Plymouth Herald}}</ref> In September 2016, Brent told the [[Plymouth Herald]] that he hoped a 'redeveloped grandstand' would be completed in time for the 400th anniversary of the [[Mayflower]] sailing in 2020 when the city of Plymouth will host significant celebrations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/plymouth-argyle-supremo-james-brent-wants-new-home-park-grandstand-by-2020/story-29733938-detail/story.html|title=New grandstand at Home Park 'well before 2020' says James Brent|date=20 September 2016|accessdate=22 December 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921190352/http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/plymouth-argyle-supremo-james-brent-wants-new-home-park-grandstand-by-2020/story-29733938-detail/story.html|archive-date=21 September 2016|publisher=Plymouth Herald}}</ref>\n\n===Port Vale===\n\n*Stadium: [[Vale Park]]\n* Capacity: 19,052<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.efl.com/clubs-and-competitions/sky-bet-league-two/clubs/port-vale/|title=EFL Official Website - Port Vale|website=www.efl.com|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref>\n*''Current stadium status'': Reconstructed.\n[[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]]'s [[Vale Park]] saw the Lorne Street stand demolished in 1998, and work began on a \u00a33 million all-seater replacement.

A trend towards all-seater stadiums was initially prescribed by the [[Taylor Report]], and was originally a condition only of [[Premier League]] admission. It has now become a requirement that within three years of a club's first promotion to [[Football League Championship|the Championship]] all paying spectators are seated, even if the club is subsequently relegated. This page provides an (incomplete) list and description of those clubs who have planned new stadiums or refurbishments, or who have already moved/refurbished since around the time of the Taylor Report.\n\nThe following list includes clubs that are based in [[Wales]] but play in the [[English football league system]].\n\n==History==\nWhen [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] moved to [[Glanford Park]] in 1988, it was the first time a [[The Football League|Football League]] club had moved to a new purpose-built home since 1956.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/chesters-grounds-for-hope-built-in-just-30-weeks-the-deva-stadium-has-allowed-frustrated-fans-to-welcome-their-team-home-from-exile-1542436.html|title=Chester's grounds for hope|newspaper=The Independent|date=25 August 1992|accessdate=19 May 2010|location=London|first=Phil|last=Shaw}}</ref> Up to this point, most sides were playing in grounds that had been largely structurally unchanged for most of the 20th century. One of the few clubs to play in a completely rebuilt post [[World War II]] stadium was [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], whose stadium had been rebuilt due to bomb damage during the war, and significantly altered in the 1960s and again in the early 1980s.\n\nGround improvements were seldom, most clubs rarely reached their capacity on a regular basis, and poor facilities were commonplace \u2013 this particularly being the case between 1979 and 1986, when attendances fell, with this fall in spectators being blamed largely on increased [[Football hooliganism|hooliganism]], as well as the [[Early 1980s recession|economic downturn]] and sharp rise in unemployment that occurred in the early 1980s. The main source of income came from gate receipts, and most additional money was spent on transfers. It was not until the growing concern in the 1980s about the safety of existing stadiums, that clubs began to examine the possibilities offered by redeveloping their grounds. This was first highlighted in May 1985, when 56 fans were burnt to death [[Bradford City stadium fire|in a fire]] at the [[Bradford City F.C.|Bradford City]] stadium, and even more so in the aftermath of the [[Hillsborough disaster]] of April 1989, which led to the death of 96 [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] fans at an [[FA Cup]] semi-final. Poor maintenance was seen as the main reason for the fire at Bradford, while the presence of perimeter fencing and standing areas (as well as loss of police control) were seen as the main factors in the Hillsborough tragedy.\n\nIn January 1990, the [[Taylor Report]] recommended the conversion of all [[Football League]] stadiums to all-seater arenas<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballnetwork.org/dev/communityfootball/violence_taylor_report.asp |title=The Taylor Report |publisher=Footballnetwork.org |date=15 April 1989 |accessdate=13 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415180944/http://www.footballnetwork.org/dev/communityfootball/violence_taylor_report.asp |archivedate=15 April 2008 }}</ref> although this was subsequently applied just to the top two levels with effect from the [[1994-95 in English football|1994\u201395 season]]. The report had ordered third and fourth tier teams to follow suit by 1999, but clubs at this level were allowed to continue with standing accommodation.\n\nThis was given governmental financial assistance, and while unpopular with many fans, attendances began to rise again in the 1990s.\n\nThe new all-seater arrangement tended to be more popular with both the clubs and football authorities, as they had the combined benefits of being safer and more profitable.\n\nThe boom in television rights following the creation of the [[Premier League]] in 1992 allowed a number of clubs to further expand their stadiums, or even move to new ones. Realising the commercial possibilities of new stadiums, many ambitious outfits constructed purpose-built stadiums often on the outskirts of cities or in urban regeneration areas. It has become common for clubs to tie these new stadiums in with residential or leisure complexes.\n\nA number of lower-league clubs had plans for ground improvements halted following the collapse of [[ITV Digital]] and the lucrative broadcasting contract they had agreed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1896732.stm |title=BUSINESS &#124; ITV Digital goes broke |work=BBC News |date=27 March 2002 |accessdate=14 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1961343.stm |title=BUSINESS &#124; The fallout from ITV Digital's collapse |work=BBC News |date=1 May 2002 |accessdate=14 April 2010}}</ref> Following the re-sale of rights, a number of these programmes have been re-activated in recent years, and some of the heaviest stadium redevelopment has been in the lower divisions.

Initially two stands were open, with a third stand opening later in 1994, but eventually the 2 tiered North Stand was completed to leave an all seater stadium with a capacity of 24,500 in 1998. The Stadium complex includes fitness and leisure facilities built behind the North Stand with gymnasium, swimming pool and hotel facilities and offices. The venture was a tri-partide one with Huddersfield Town, [[Huddersfield Giants]] Rugby league club and Kirklees Metropolitan Council being shareholders in a 40:20:40 ratio with a company called KSDL. After Huddersfield Town went into administration the 40% shares were bought for \u00a32 by Rugby League Chairman and owner [[Ken Davy]], and transferred into his own private company Huddersfield Sporting Pride which holds 60% ownership of the Stadium complex at present.\n\nThere are current plans for significant construction work around the Stadium which would provide Hotels, Shops, a Riverside leisure facility, bars and restaurants opposite the Stadium and on the Golf driving range site and either side of the river. The project, HDOne, would provide ongoing and significant income streams to KSDL, the company which runs and owns the stadium. There is potential for further expansion of the capacity by adding a 2nd tier to the East Stand but no plans are being considered as yet. The North Stand Lower Tier remains as a temporary seating area to facilitate any rock concerts that could be held at the Stadium. However, there have not been any in recent years and there is hope that a permanent stand will be constructed here as a standing terrace for home fans.\n\n===Hull City===\n\n* Stadium: [[KCOM Stadium]] \n* Capacity: 25,586<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.efl.com/clubs-and-competitions/sky-bet-championship/clubs/hull-city/|title=EFL Official Website - Hull City|website=www.efl.com|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref>\n*''Current stadium status'': New.\n\n[[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull's]] [[KC Stadium]], which opened in December 2002 with a capacity of more than 25,000 seats to replace [[Boothferry Park]], is designed to provide for future expansion to a capacity of approximately 45,000 by the addition of a second tier on the Arco East Stand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kcstadium.co.uk/kc-stadium/stadium-facts |title=The Kingston Communications Stadium |publisher=Kcstadium.co.uk |date= |accessdate=13 October 2013}}</ref> In March 2008 the Hull chairman said an expansion could potentially take place within two years if there was a clear need for further capacity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Hull-City-promotion-mean-KC-expansion/story-11945621-detail/story.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20131013211139/http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Hull-City-promotion-mean-KC-expansion/story-11945621-detail/story.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-10-13|title=Hull City promotion could mean KC expansion|publisher=}}</ref> In January 2011 it was announced that Hull, under new owner [[Assem Allam]], were interested in buying the KC Stadium from [[Hull City Council]] in order to redevelop the stadium and the vicinity of it.<ref>{{cite news|title=Allams plan to buy KC Stadium from Hull City Council|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hull_city/9355077.stm|work=BBC Sport|date=11 January 2011|accessdate=19 December 2012}}</ref> Consultation with the council commenced in May.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hull City owner Allam in stadium talks with council|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hull_city/9495830.stm|date=24 May 2011|accessdate=19 December 2012|work=BBC Sport}}</ref> These talks broke down in September 2011,<ref>{{cite news|title=KC Stadium not to be sold by city council to Hull City|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/15077080|work=BBC Sport|date=27 September 2011|accessdate=19 December 2012}}</ref> leading the club to announce in December 2012 their intention to move into a new stadium should the club achieve promotion back to the Premier League.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hull City owner plans stadium move if they win promotion|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20773372|work=BBC Sport|date=18 December 2012|accessdate=19 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nWhen Hull moved to the stadium in December 2002, they were still playing in [[Football League Division Three|Division Three]] (they reached the Premier League in 2008).

The stadium, which held 30,000 seated fans on its completion, is located on the site of a former chemical works on the banks of the Middlesbrough dock and its channel to the [[River Tees]]. The land for the stadium was gifted to the club by the [[Teesside Development Corporation]] for a nominal \u00a31 fee in the hope it would spur development of the disused former dock area. The stadium was the largest newly built stadium in post-war England, and the initial success of the new ground is considered to have spurred on other clubs such as [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] and [[Derby County]] to move from their traditional homes to newly built Taylor-compliant stadiums in designated redevelopment zones.\n\nAyresome Park's location meant that it would have impractical to achieve an all-seater capacity of more than 20,000.\n\nThe stadium took a mere 32 weeks to build, with the planned relocation being announced in late 1993 and work beginning just a year later.\n\nDemand meant the stadium was expanded in 1998 to take the capacity to 35,100, but subsequent reorganisation and the installation of a big screen has seen the capacity reduced marginally to 34,742.

It was designed with effective crowd management in mind (particularly given Millwall's crowd problems at The Old Den), with the escape routes being short and direct. After chairman Reg Burr decided that it would not be viable to redevelop The Old Den as an all-seater stadium, he announced in 1990 that the club would relocate to a new stadium in the Senegal Fields area in south Bermondsey. Originally, it was planned to have a seating capacity of between 25,000 and 30,000, however, the club opted to wait so the capacity was kept to just over 20,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.millwall-history.org.uk/the_den5.htm|title=Moving On: The New Den|website=www.millwall-history.org.uk}}</ref>\n\nMillwall played their final game at The Old Den on 8 May 1993 after 83 years and then moved to the new stadium a quarter-of-a-mile away from Cold Blow Lane. The \u00a316 million New Den was opened by [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]], the leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and of [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|the Opposition]] at the time, on 4 August 1993 prior to a prestigious friendly against [[Sporting Clube de Portugal|Sporting Portugal]], which Sporting won 2\u20131.

The plans are controversial because the developer, Renewal, is controlled by [[Offshore company|offshore companies]] with unclear ownership, and is seen by the club and local community to be profiteering by demolishing existing homes and businesses as well as Millwall's car-park & the highly acclaimed and well recognised Millwall Community Trust \u2013 to build up to 2,400 new private homes, with no council housing and less than 15% of 'affordable housing'.

In the late 1990s the club submitted a planning application for a new stadium on the western outskirts of Grimsby at [[Great Coates]], adjacent to the [[A180 road (England)|A180 dual carriageway]]. The provisionally titled Conoco Stadium was to be funded by a partnership with a major retailer and would be built with a capacity of 14,000 that could be expanded up to 21,000 (to meet Premier League requirements) in a matter of weeks by building the entire structure of the stadium but not installing any facilities or seats in the four corners of the stadium until they were required.\n\nThe new stadium would have included facilities to match the best Premier League clubs including a substantial increase in match-day hospitality areas, more [[Luxury box|corporate boxes]] of a far higher standard, more cafe and bar areas including for away supporters, significantly more toilets, larger and more versatile player dressing rooms, wider seats with more legroom, a hard-wearing hybrid pitch capable of withstanding multiple rugby and football matches being played on it every week and facilities that could be used throughout the year for corporate events.\n\nThe aim was to open the new stadium for the start of the 2001/2002 season. After considerable opposition to the plans from local residents delayed the project, the new stadium received planning permission from [[North East Lincolnshire Council]] in November 2000. The [[Government Office|Government Office for Yorkshire and the Humber]] approved the plan in February 2002, [[Conoco]] agreed naming rights to the stadium in April 2002 and the revised opening date was set for the start of the 2003/2004 season. At the end of 2002 retailers [[Woolworths Group|Woolworths]] and [[B&Q]] pulled out of the scheme and opening was set back again to the 2005/2006 season.

This would make the fish docks site less desirable as it could limit the regeneration of the fishing industry and the regeneration opportunities of the Freeman Street site more attractive to government as it considers funding.\n\nAt the end of December 2019 the leader of the council stated that regeneration of the Freeman Street area with a new stadium on it was \"top of his wish list for 2020\".<ref>https://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/news/grimsby-news/freeman-street-top-leaders-wish-3675684</ref>\n\n=== Leyton Orient ===\n\n*Stadium: [[Brisbane Road|The Breyer Group Stadium]]\n* Capacity: 9,271<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.efl.com/clubs-and-competitions/sky-bet-league-two/clubs/leyton-orient/|title=EFL Official Website - Leyton Orient|website=www.efl.com|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref>\n* ''Current stadium status'': Reconstructed.\n\n=== Macclesfield Town ===\n\n*Stadium: [[Moss Rose]]\n* Capacity: 6,355<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.efl.com/clubs-and-competitions/sky-bet-league-two/clubs/macclesfield-town/|title=EFL Official Website - Macclesfield Town|website=www.efl.com|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref>\n* ''Current stadium status'': Reconstructed.\n\n=== Mansfield Town ===\n\n*Stadium: [[Field Mill|One Call Stadium]]\n* Capacity: 9,186<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.efl.com/clubs-and-competitions/sky-bet-league-two/clubs/mansfield-town/|title=EFL Official Website - Mansfield Town|website=www.efl.com|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref>\n* ''Current stadium status'': Reconstructed.\n\n===Morecambe===\n\n*Stadium: [[Globe Arena (football stadium)|Globe Arena]]\n* Capacity: 6,476<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.efl.com/clubs-and-competitions/sky-bet-league-two/clubs/morecambe/|title=EFL Official Website - Morecambe|website=www.efl.com|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref>\n*''Current stadium status'': New.\n\n[[Morecambe F.C.|Morecambe]] moved from its previous ground at [[Christie Park (Morecambe, England)|Christie Park]] to [[Globe Arena (football stadium)|The Globe Arena]] at the start of the [[2010-11 Football League|2010\u201311 season]].<ref name=\"mns\">{{cite web |url=http://www.morecambestadium.co.uk/ |title=WELCOME TO THE FUTURE \u2013 Globe Arena &#124; Morecambe new ground &#124; Globe Construction &#124; new ground stadium Morecambe &#124; Morecambe regeneration &#124; Westgate developm |publisher=Morecambe Stadium |accessdate=14 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212043206/http://www.morecambestadium.co.uk/ |archive-date=12 February 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The ground has a capacity of 6000, comprising 2000 seats and 4000 standing spaces.<ref name=\"mns\" />\n\n=== Newport County ===\n\n*Stadium: [[Rodney Parade]]\n* Capacity: 8,700<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.efl.com/clubs-and-competitions/sky-bet-league-two/clubs/newport-county/|title=EFL Official Website - Newport County|website=www.efl.com|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref>\n* ''Current stadium status'': Reconstructed.\n\n=== Northampton Town ===\n\n*Stadium: [[Sixfields Stadium|Sixfields]]\n* Capacity: 7,798<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.efl.com/clubs-and-competitions/sky-bet-league-two/clubs/northampton-town/|title=EFL Official Website - Northampton Town|website=www.efl.com|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref>\n*''Current stadium status'': New.\n\n===Oldham Athletic===\n\n*Stadium: [[Boundary Park]]\n* Capacity: 13,513<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.efl.com/clubs-and-competitions/sky-bet-league-two/clubs/oldham-athletic/|title=EFL Official Website - Oldham Athletic|website=www.efl.com|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref>\n*''Current stadium status'': Reconstructed.\n\n[[Boundary Park]] has been all-seater stadium since the mid-1990s, though the improvements were very much a task of refurbishment rather than reconstruction.  The only reconstruction happened at the Rochdale Road End of the ground where the old traditional open terrace was replaced by a 4,600 capacity all seated stand.  The Chadderton Road End on the opposite side of the ground simply had seats bolted onto the terrace, whilst the Main Stand and Broadway Stand had seats added to the lower tiers of the stand.\n\nThere were plans in the late 1990s for a move to a new 20,000 all seater stadium on adjoining waste ground, but these were scrapped.\n\nBecause of these problems, the club announced in the summer of 2009 that it was considering moving to a new stadium in Failsworth.  However, the Charities Commission later turned down the application.\n\nOn 28 July 2011 Oldham Metropolitan Borough Council offered the club \u00a35.7 million to help with their redevelopment fund of Boundary Park, which would involve the redevelopment of the Broadway Stand.\n\nPlanning approval for the new North Stand was confirmed in April 2013, including a 2,671 capacity stand, a health and fitness suite, supporters' bar and event facilities.  Demolition and preparatory work started in the summer of 2013.\nConstruction of the new North Stand is still ongoing, although the seating area in the stand was open for use on 17 October 2015 for the home match against Sheffield United.  The new North Stand is significantly taller than the stand that it replaced although the capacity for supporters is roughly the same, bringing the ground capacity up to 13,512.

The first stage of reconstruction at the ground took place in 2001, with the replacement of 3 stands with an all-seater horseshoe-shaped stand. Following the construction, the club then planned to rebuild the main grandstand. This initially did not materialize, and following the financial crisis at the club in 2010 and 2011, future stadium plans were put on hold.\n\nAfter [[Plymouth Argyle]] went into administration, the club was taken over by local business owner James Brent, and fresh plans for a new Mayflower Grandstand were submitted to [[Plymouth City Council]]. The plans included the stand itself, as well as a new 1500-seat-capacity ice rink, 10-screen cinema and a hotel that would provide funds for the club. The plans received planning permission on 15 August 2013, with Brent suggesting that development could begin immediately. The old grandstand was planned to be demolished in late October 2013, but was put on hold after rival plans for similar leisure facilities at Bretonside were approved.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/new-plan-home-park-grandstand-cinema-deal/story-26859816-detail/story.html|title=New plan for Home Park grandstand as cinema deal 'scuppered'|date=8 July 2015|accessdate=22 December 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909184918/http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/New-plan-Home-Park-grandstand-cinema-deal/story-26859816-detail/story.html|archive-date=9 September 2015|publisher=Plymouth Herald}}</ref> In September 2016, Brent told the [[Plymouth Herald]] that he hoped a 'redeveloped grandstand' would be completed in time for the 400th anniversary of the [[Mayflower]] sailing in 2020 when the city of Plymouth will host significant celebrations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/plymouth-argyle-supremo-james-brent-wants-new-home-park-grandstand-by-2020/story-29733938-detail/story.html|title=New grandstand at Home Park 'well before 2020' says James Brent|date=20 September 2016|accessdate=22 December 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921190352/http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/plymouth-argyle-supremo-james-brent-wants-new-home-park-grandstand-by-2020/story-29733938-detail/story.html|archive-date=21 September 2016|publisher=Plymouth Herald}}</ref>\n\n===Port Vale===\n\n*Stadium: [[Vale Park]]\n* Capacity: 19,052<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.efl.com/clubs-and-competitions/sky-bet-league-two/clubs/port-vale/|title=EFL Official Website - Port Vale|website=www.efl.com|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref>\n*''Current stadium status'': Reconstructed.\n[[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]]'s [[Vale Park]] saw the Lorne Street stand demolished in 1998, and work began on a \u00a33 million all-seater replacement.
