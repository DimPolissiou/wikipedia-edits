Since 1994, he has been a television [[sports analyst]] and co-host of ''[[Fox NFL Sunday]]''. Bradshaw is also an actor, having participated in many television shows and films, most notably starring in the movie ''[[Failure to Launch]]''. He played for 14 seasons with Pittsburgh, won four [[Super Bowl]] titles in a six-year period ([[Super Bowl IX|1974]], [[Super Bowl X|1975]], [[Super Bowl XIII|1978]], and [[Super Bowl XIV|1979]]), becoming the first quarterback to win three and four Super Bowls, and led the Steelers to eight [[AFC Central]] championships. He was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1989, his first year of eligibility. Bradshaw was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 1996.\n\nA tough competitor, Bradshaw is known for having one of the most powerful arms in NFL history.

He played very well in the Super Bowl, and in four career Super Bowl appearances, he passed for 932 yards and 9 touchdowns, both Super Bowl records at the time of his retirement.

As a junior, he amassed 2,890 total yards, ranking No. 1 in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], and led his team to a 9\u20132 record and a 33\u201313 win over [[Akron Zips football|Akron]] in the Rice Bowl. In his senior season, he gained 2,314 yards, ranking third in the NCAA, and led his team to an 8\u20132 record. His decrease in production was mainly because his team played only 10 games that year, and he was taken out of several games in the second half because his team had built up a huge lead.\n\nBradshaw graduated owning virtually all Louisiana Tech passing records at the time. In 1984, he was inducted into the inaugural class of the Louisiana Tech sports hall of fame.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lasportshall.com/inductees/football/terry-bradshaw/?back=inductee | title=LA TECH ATHLETIC HALL OF FAME | accessdate=January 1, 2017 | website=latechsports.com}}</ref> Four years later, he was inducted into the state of Louisiana's sports hall of fame.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bradshaw, LA Sports Hall of Fame|url=http://www.lasportshall.com/inductees/football/terry-bradshaw/?back=inductee|website=LA Sports Hall of Fame|accessdate=January 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==NFL career==\n\n===Pittsburgh Steelers===\nIn the [[1970 NFL Draft]], Bradshaw was the first overall player selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers.

During his first few seasons, the 6'3\", 215-pound quarterback was erratic, threw many interceptions (he threw 210 interceptions over the course of his career) and was widely ridiculed by the media for his rural roots and perceived lack of intelligence.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite news| url =https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=gL9scSG3K_gC&dat=19701109&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|title= Blowing Bubbles|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date =November 9, 1970}}</ref>\n\nIt took Bradshaw several seasons to adjust to the NFL, but he eventually led the Steelers to eight [[AFC Central]] championships and four Super Bowl titles. The Pittsburgh Steelers featured the \"[[Steel Curtain]]\" defense and a powerful running attack led by [[Franco Harris]] and [[Rocky Bleier]], but Bradshaw's strong arm gave them the threat of the deep pass, helping to loosen opposing defenses. In [[1972 NFL Season|1972]], he threw the \"[[Immaculate Reception]]\" pass to Franco Harris to beat the Raiders in the AFC Divisional playoffs, which is among the most famous plays in NFL history.\n\nBradshaw temporarily lost the starting job to [[Joe Gilliam]] in 1974, but he took over again during the regular season. In the [[1974 AFC Championship Game]] against the [[Oakland Raiders]], his fourth-quarter touchdown pass to [[Lynn Swann]] proved to be the winning score in a 24\u201313 victory. In the Steelers' 16\u20136 [[Super Bowl IX]] victory over the [[Minnesota Vikings]] that followed, Bradshaw completed 9 of 14 passes and his fourth-quarter touchdown pass put the game out of reach and helped take the Steelers to their first Super Bowl victory.\n\nIn [[Super Bowl X]] following the [[1975 NFL Season|1975]] season, Bradshaw threw for 209 yards, most of them to Swann, as the Steelers beat the [[Dallas Cowboys]], 21\u201317. His late-4th-quarter, 64-yard touchdown pass to Swann, released a split-second before defensive tackle [[Larry Cole]] flattened him, was selected by NFL Films as the \"Greatest Throw of All Time\".\n\nNeck and wrist injuries in 1976 forced Bradshaw to miss four games. He was sharp in a 40\u201314 victory over the [[Baltimore Colts]], completing 14 of 18 passes for 264 yards and three touchdowns, but the Steelers' hopes of a three-peat ended when both of their 1,000-yard rushers (Franco Harris and Rocky Bleier) were injured in the win over the Colts, and the Steelers subsequently lost to the Oakland Raiders in the AFC Championship game, 24-7. [[Jack Lambert (American football)|Jack Lambert]] asserted that that 1976 Steelers team was the best team that he ever played on, including the four Super Bowl teams of which he was a part.\n\nBradshaw had his finest season in [[1978 NFL Season|1978]] when he was named the NFL's [[National Football League Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] by the [[Associated Press]] after a season in which he completed 207 of 368 passes for 2,915 yards and a league-leading 28 touchdown passes. He was also named [[All-Pro]] and All-AFC that year, despite throwing 20 interceptions.\n\nBefore [[Super Bowl XIII]], a Steelers-Cowboys rematch, Cowboys [[linebacker]] [[Thomas \"Hollywood\" Henderson]] famously ridiculed Bradshaw by saying, \"He couldn't spell 'Cat' if you spotted him the 'c' and the 'a'.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/mike-tomlin-invokes-hollywood-henderson-to-perfectly-troll-terry-bradshaw/ | title=Mike Tomlin invokes 'Hollywood' Henderson to perfectly troll Terry Bradshaw | accessdate=January 20, 2019}}</ref> Bradshaw got his revenge by winning the [[Super Bowl MVP|Most Valuable Player]] award, completing 17 of 30 passes for a then-record 318 yards and four touchdowns in a 35\u201331 win. Bradshaw has in later years made light of the ridicule with quips such as \"it's football, not rocket science.\"\n\nBradshaw won his second straight Super Bowl MVP award in 1979 in [[Super Bowl XIV]]. He passed for 309 yards and two touchdowns in a 31\u201319 win over the [[Los Angeles Rams]]. Early in the fourth quarter, with Pittsburgh down 19\u201317, Bradshaw again turned to the long pass to help engineer a victory: a 73-yard touchdown to [[John Stallworth]]. Bradshaw shared ''Sports Illustrated'''s [[Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year|Sportsman of the Year]] award that season with fellow Pittsburgh star [[Willie Stargell]], whose [[1979 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pirates won the 1979 World Series]].\n\n[[File:1983 Steelers Police - 04 Terry Bradshaw (crop).jpg|thumb|left|Bradshaw playing with the Steelers in 1982|alt=]]\nAfter two seasons of missing the playoffs, Bradshaw played through pain\u2014he needed a cortisone shot before every game because of an elbow injury sustained during training camp\u2014in a strike-shortened [[1982 NFL season]]. He still managed to tie for the most touchdown passes in the league with 17. In a 31\u201328 playoff loss to the [[San Diego Chargers]], Bradshaw's last postseason game, he completed 28-of-39 passes for 325 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions.\n\nAfter undergoing off-season elbow surgery, Bradshaw was idle for the first 14 games of the 1983 NFL season. Then on December 10, 1983, against the [[New York Jets]], he felt a pop in his elbow while throwing his final pass, a 10-yard touchdown to [[Calvin Sweeney]] in the second quarter of the Steelers' 34\u20137 win. Bradshaw later left the game and never played again. The two touchdowns Bradshaw threw in what would be the final NFL game played at [[Shea Stadium]] (and the last NFL game played in [[New York City]] proper to date) allowed him to finish his career with two more touchdowns (212) than interceptions (210).\n{{Clear}}\n\nBradshaw's retirement came as a surprise to some,<ref name=\"Retirement\" /> and in hindsight unplanned on the Steelers' part.<ref name=\"30for30\">{{cite episode | title=Elway to Marino | series=30 for 30 | network=ESPN | airdate=2013-04-23 | season=2}}</ref> Before Bradshaw's elbow problems came about, the team chose to pass up [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pitt]] quarterback [[Dan Marino]] in the [[1983 NFL Draft]] as an heir successor to Bradshaw due in part to head coach [[Chuck Noll]] wanting to rebuild on defense and, according to [[Bill Hillgrove]], the [[Rooney family]] not wanting Marino to face a lot of pressure in his hometown and needing to experience life outside of [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland]], where Marino grew up and where Pitt is located.<ref name=\"30for30\" /> The player the Steelers drafted instead ([[Gabriel Rivera]]) only played six games before becoming a [[quadriplegic]] following a drunk driving accident, and Marino's subsequent success with the [[Miami Dolphins]] prompted [[Art Rooney]] to remind his sons daily until his death that the team \"should've drafted Marino.\"<ref name=\"30for30\" /> The decision also set the franchise back at quarterback: while the team would eventually return to being a Super Bowl contender after their rebuilding period during the mid-1980s, the team wouldn't have a consistent quarterback until [[Ben Roethlisberger]] arrived in 2004.\n\nAlthough the Steelers have not officially retired Bradshaw's number 12, they have not reissued it since his retirement and it is understood that no Steeler will ever wear it again.\n\n==After football==\nIn July 1997, Bradshaw served as the presenter when [[Mike Webster]], his center on the Steelers' Super Bowl XIII and XIV title teams, was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].\n\nIn 2006, despite the Steelers being one of the teams playing in the game, Bradshaw did not attend a pregame celebration for past Super Bowl MVP's during [[Super Bowl XL]] in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]. According to reports, Bradshaw (along with three time MVP and close friend [[Joe Montana]]) requested a US$100,000 guarantee for his appearance in the Super Bowl MVP Parade, and associated appearances. The NFL could not guarantee that they would make that much and refused. A representative for Bradshaw has since denied this report. After an appearance on [[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]] (February 6, 2006) Bradshaw stated that the reason why he did not attend the MVP parade was that he was spending time with family, that he hates the crowds and the Super Bowl media circus, and also that the only way he would attend a Super Bowl is when Fox is broadcasting the game (it was [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] who broadcast Super Bowl XL), though Bradshaw attended several press conferences in Detroit days earlier. Bradshaw also stated that money was not an issue.\n\nIn April 2006, Bradshaw donated his four Super Bowl rings, College Football Hall of Fame ring, Pro Football Hall of Fame ring, Hall of Fame bust, four miniature replica Super Bowl trophies, and a helmet and jersey from one of his Super Bowl victories to his alma mater, Louisiana Tech.\n\nOn November 5, 2007, during a nationally televised [[Monday Night Football]] game, Bradshaw joined former teammates including [[Franco Harris]] and [[Joe Greene (American football)|Joe Greene]] to accept their position on the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] 75th Anniversary All-Time Team.\n\n===Broadcasting career===\nBradshaw retired from football on July 24, 1984,<ref name=\"Retirement\">{{cite news|url=http://cover32.com/2016/07/05/day-terry-bradshaw-retired-steelers/|title=The day Terry Bradshaw retired from the Steelers|date=July 5, 2016|publisher=Cover32|accessdate=August 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827132451/http://cover32.com/2016/07/05/day-terry-bradshaw-retired-steelers/|archive-date=August 27, 2017|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref> and quickly signed a television contract with [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] to become an NFL game analyst in [[1984 NFL season|1984]], where he and play-by-play announcer [[Verne Lundquist]] had the top [[Nielsen ratings|rated]] programs.

In 1994, with the Fox network establishing its sports division with their purchase of NFL TV rights, Bradshaw joined ''Fox NFL Sunday'', where he normally acts as a [[foil (literature)|comic foil]] to his co-hosts. On ''Fox NFL Sunday'' he hosts two semi-regular features, ''Ten Yards with TB'', where he fires random questions at an NFL pro, and ''The Terry Awards'', an annual comedic award show about the NFL season. As a cross-promotional stunt, he also hosted two consecutive ''Digi-Bowl'' specials in 2001 and 2002 on [[Fox Kids]], providing commentary from the ''NFL on Fox'' studio in-between episodes of ''[[Digimon: Digital Monsters]]''; the 2002 special was the final one as the Fox Kids block ended the same year. He appeared on the first broadcast of ''[[NASCAR on FOX]]'' where he took a ride with [[Dale Earnhardt]] at [[Daytona International Speedway]] the night before Earnhardt was [[Death of Dale Earnhardt|killed in a last lap crash]] in the [[2001 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]]. Bradshaw also waved the [[Racing flags#Green flag|green flag]] at the start of the ill-fated race.\n\nBradshaw has the reputation of being the \"ol' redneck\", but, in co-host and former NFL coach [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]]'s words, the act is a \"schtick.\"<ref name=\"Five Questions With Jimmy Johnson\">[http://dailytailgate.com/issues/47-DT-Jimmy-Johnson-QA-In-Case-You-Misse Five Questions With Jimmy Johnson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022003654/http://dailytailgate.com/issues/47-DT-Jimmy-Johnson-QA-In-Case-You-Misse |date=October 22, 2009 }}</ref> According to Johnson, Bradshaw deflects such criticism by stating that \"he's so dumb that he has to have somebody else fly his private plane.\"<ref name=\"Five Questions With Jimmy Johnson\"/>\n\nBradshaw has also garnered the reputation for criticizing players and teams.<ref name=\"Treadway\">{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/23/ann-mara-terry-bradshaw-giants-locker-room_n_1223765.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Daniel | last=Treadway | title=Wife Of Late Giants Owner Yells At Terry Bradshaw | date=January 23, 2012}}</ref> Following [[Super Bowl XLVI]] he was confronted by Ann Mara, wife of the late [[Wellington Mara]], and \"heckled\" for not picking the Giants to win on [[Fox NFL Sunday]].<ref name=\"Treadway\"/>\n\n===Business career===\nDuring the early part of his career with the Steelers, Bradshaw was a [[Automobile salesperson|used car salesman]] during the off-season to supplement his income, as this was still during the days when most NFL players didn't make enough money to focus solely on football.<ref>''[[NFL on Fox]]'', [[Philadelphia Eagles]] vs. [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], August 19, 2011</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/sports/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2010/07/scott_decamp_column_nfl_hall_o.html|title=Scott DeCamp column: NFL Hall of Famer Terry Bradshaw forever the entertainer|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, Bradshaw sold peanut butter with his name and image on the label.

His cover of \"[[I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry]]\" hit Top 20 on Billboard's country chart (and No. 91 on the Hot 100) in 1976; two other tunes (\"The Last Word In Lonesome Is Me\" and \"Until You\") also made the country charts.<ref name=\"whitburn\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|page=58|isbn=0-89820-177-2}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, Bradshaw entered the world of [[NASCAR]] by joining with HighLine Performance Group racing team to form [[FitzBradshaw Racing]].

The first three of Bradshaw's marriages have all ended in divorce, a subject he ridicules frequently on his NFL pre-game show. Bradshaw was married for the fourth time, on July 8, 2014, to Tammy, his girlfriend of 15 years.<ref>https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/tv-radio/2020/01/29/Terry-Bradshaw-Bradshaw-Bunch-family-E-reality-Kardashians-Steelers/stories/202001290136</ref>\n\n[[File:Terry Bradshaw, Louisiana.jpg|thumb|left|Bradshaw in 1979|alt=|303x303px]]\nAfter his NFL career ended, Bradshaw disclosed that he had frequently experienced [[anxiety attack]]s after games. The problem worsened in the late 1990s after his third divorce, when he said he \"could not bounce back\" as he had after the previous divorces or after a bad game. In addition to anxiety attacks, his symptoms included weight loss, frequent crying, and [[insomnia|sleeplessness]]. He was diagnosed with [[clinical depression]]. Since then he has taken [[Paroxetine|Paxil]] regularly. He chose to speak out about his depression to overcome the stigma associated with it and to urge others to seek help.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/spotlighthealth/2004-01-30-bradshaw_x.htm|work=[[USA Today]]|first1=John|last1=Morgan|title=Terry Bradshaw's winning drive against depression|date=January 30, 2004}}</ref>\n\nBradshaw's anxieties about appearing in public, away from the controlled environment of a television studio, led to an unintentional estrangement from the Steelers. When team founder and owner [[Art Rooney]] died in 1988, Bradshaw did not attend his funeral. A year later, during his Hall of Fame induction speech, Bradshaw made a point of saluting his late boss and friend, pointing to the sky and saying, \"Art Rooney&nbsp;...&nbsp;boy, I tell you, I loved that man.\"{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nStill, Bradshaw never returned to [[Three Rivers Stadium]] for a Steelers game. When the last regular season game was played there on December 16, 2000, Bradshaw was with the ''Fox NFL Sunday'' crew, doing their pre-game show aboard the aircraft carrier [[USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75)|USS ''Harry S. Truman'']], while Fox covered the game live. Bradshaw expressed regret that he could not be there, but would later say privately that he did not feel he could face the crowds. It would not be until September 2002, when fellow Hall of Fame teammate and longtime friend [[Mike Webster]] died, that Bradshaw finally returned to Pittsburgh to attend his friend's funeral.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn October 2002, Bradshaw returned to the Steelers sideline for the first time in twenty years for a [[Monday Night Football|Monday night]] [[2002 Pittsburgh Steelers season#Week 7 .28Monday October 21.2C 2002.29: vs. Indianapolis Colts|game]] between the Steelers and the [[Indianapolis Colts]]. In [[2003 NFL season|2003]], when the Steelers played the 1,000th game in franchise history, Fox covered the game at [[Heinz Field]], and Bradshaw returned to cover the game. In addition to appearing to take his position on the Steelers All-Time Team in 2007 as part of the team's 75th anniversary festivities, he also was on the sideline for the [[2007 NFL season|2007]] home opener, where the Steelers earned their 500th regular season win.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nPolitically, Bradshaw is a long-time supporter of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/capital-living/20-questions/20860-20-questions-with-mike-ditka-and-terry-bradshaw|title=20 Questions with Mike Ditka and Terry Bradshaw|first=Ashley|last=Perks|date=June 18, 2008|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]}}</ref> In 2012, he went on record on Fox News as supporting the candidacy of [[Newt Gingrich]] for the Republican presidential nomination.<ref name=\"foxnewsinsider.com\">{{cite web|url=http://insider.foxnews.com/2012/01/04/nfl-analyst-terry-bradshaw-talks-newt-gingrich-tim-tebow-nutrisystem|title=NFL Analyst Terry Bradshaw Talks Newt Gingrich, Tim Tebow & Nutrisystem|date=January 4, 2012|publisher=Fox News|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20160417222530/http://insider.foxnews.com/2012/01/04/nfl-analyst-terry-bradshaw-talks-newt-gingrich-tim-tebow-nutrisystem|archivedate=April 17, 2016}}</ref> In the same interview, he also labeled linebacker [[Terrell Suggs]] \"an idiot\" for making comments critical of [[Denver]] quarterback [[Tim Tebow]]'s public remarks about his Christian faith, saying Suggs \"better be careful; if I were him I'd be on my hands and knees tonight asking for forgiveness because that's totally unacceptable.\"<ref name=\"foxnewsinsider.com\"/>\n\n===Relationship with Chuck Noll===\nWhile Bradshaw never had any problems with the [[Rooney family]], he had a complicated relationship with Steelers head coach [[Chuck Noll]].

The most recent was the series of live-ads for [[Tide (brand)|Tide]] detergent along with his Fox Sports co-host [[Curt Menefee]], where Bradshaw shows up with a shirt stain on what appeared to be live TV from the Fox broadcast booth at [[Super Bowl LI]] and then washes it with Tide at the house of [[Jeffrey Tambor]]. The teasers leading up to the Super Bowl showed Tambor initially taking his shirts to [[Rob Gronkowski]]'s dry cleaners only to see the sleeves get ripped out.

He also appeared on ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'' with [[Howie Long]] as the trashy coach of a women's ice hockey team. He hosted a short-lived television series in 1997 called ''Home Team with Terry Bradshaw''.\n\nIn addition to his television work, Bradshaw has appeared in several movies, including a part in the 1978 film ''[[Hooper (film)|Hooper]]'' which starred [[Burt Reynolds]], [[Jan-Michael Vincent]], and [[Sally Field]], and 1981's appearance in ''[[The Cannonball Run]]''. In 1980, he had a cameo in ''[[Smokey and the Bandit II]]'' which starred Burt Reynolds, [[Jerry Reed]], and Sally Field. He made a guest appearance in ''[[The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.]]'' in 1994, playing Colonel Forrest March, a rogue U.S. Army officer who gave orders to his squad (played by NFL members [[Ken Norton (American football player)|Ken Norton, Jr.]], [[Carl Banks]], and [[Jim Harbaugh]]) in a huddle using football diagrams.\n\nBradshaw appeared on [[Jeff Foxworthy]]'s short-lived sitcom, ''[[The Jeff Foxworthy Show]]'' as a motivational speaker for people needing to change their lives. [[Bill Engvall]]'s character is affected by Bradshaw's rantings about witchcraft and voodoo in his pre-game warm-ups.\n\nOn October 11, 2001, Bradshaw received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], the first and only NFL player (as of May 31, 2008) to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/terry-bradshaw/contributor/205079|title=Yahoo TV|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928205835/http://tv.yahoo.com/terry-bradshaw/contributor/205079|archivedate=September 28, 2012|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.circle12.com/terrybradshaw.html|title=circle12.com|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215021659/http://www.circle12.com/terrybradshaw.html|archivedate=February 15, 2008|df=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, Bradshaw returned to the silver screen in the motion picture ''[[Failure to Launch]]''. He and [[Kathy Bates]] played the parents of [[Matthew McConaughey]]'s character. In one notable scene he appeared nude, a move which [[Jay Leno]] spent an entire segment mocking during an appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''. He mentioned on May 23, 2008, on ''The Tonight Show'' that he has been a guest 37 times, and that 34 of them were on a Friday, which happens to be the lowest watched night of television. He pleasantly joked with Jay about being a 'filler' guest. He made a similar reference in an appearance on March 15, 2010, stating he was asked to guest because of a cancellation. Jay stated that at least he was not appearing on Friday, which hosts the more well-known celebrity guests. As of December 28, 2012, Bradshaw has made 50 appearances on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''.\n\nHe is also a devout Christian and wrote the book ''Terry Bradshaw: Man of Steel'' with broadcaster [[Dave Diles]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://s-usih.org/2014/01/are-you-ready-for-some-football.html |title=Are You Ready for Some Football |accessdate=June 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419071433/http://s-usih.org/2014/01/are-you-ready-for-some-football.html |archive-date=April 19, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Since 2010, Bradshaw has been hosting television shows produced by [[United States Media Television]].\n\nIn 2016 and 2018, Bradshaw had a leading role in the NBC reality-travel series ''[[Better Late Than Never (TV series)|Better Late Than Never]]'', where he travels around the world with [[William Shatner]], [[Henry Winkler]], [[George Foreman]] and [[Jeff Dye]].

Since 1994, he has been a television [[sports analyst]] and co-host of ''[[Fox NFL Sunday]]''. Bradshaw is also an actor, having participated in many television shows and films, most notably starring in the movie ''[[Failure to Launch]]''. He played for 14 seasons with Pittsburgh, won four [[Super Bowl]] titles in a six-year period ([[Super Bowl IX|1974]], [[Super Bowl X|1975]], [[Super Bowl XIII|1978]], and [[Super Bowl XIV|1979]]), becoming the first quarterback to win three and four Super Bowls, and led the Steelers to eight [[AFC Central]] championships. He was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1989, his first year of eligibility. Bradshaw was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 1996.\n\nA tough competitor, Bradshaw is known for having one of the most powerful arms in NFL history.

He played very well in the Super Bowl, and in four career Super Bowl appearances, he passed for 932 yards and 9 touchdowns, both Super Bowl records at the time of his retirement.

In his senior season, he gained 2,314 yards, ranking third in the NCAA, and led his team to an 8\u20132 record. His decrease in production was mainly because his team played only 10 games that year, and he was taken out of several games in the second half because his team had built up a huge lead.\n\nBradshaw graduated owning virtually all Louisiana Tech passing records at the time.

The Pittsburgh Steelers featured the \"[[Steel Curtain]]\" defense and a powerful running attack led by [[Franco Harris]] and [[Rocky Bleier]], but Bradshaw's strong arm gave them the threat of the deep pass, helping to loosen opposing defenses. In [[1972 NFL Season|1972]], he threw the \"[[Immaculate Reception]]\" pass to Franco Harris to beat the Raiders in the AFC Divisional playoffs, which is among the most famous plays in NFL history.\n\nBradshaw temporarily lost the starting job to [[Joe Gilliam]] in 1974, but he took over again during the regular season. In the [[1974 AFC Championship Game]] against the [[Oakland Raiders]], his fourth-quarter touchdown pass to [[Lynn Swann]] proved to be the winning score in a 24\u201313 victory. In the Steelers' 16\u20136 [[Super Bowl IX]] victory over the [[Minnesota Vikings]] that followed, Bradshaw completed 9 of 14 passes and his fourth-quarter touchdown pass put the game out of reach and helped take the Steelers to their first Super Bowl victory.\n\nIn [[Super Bowl X]] following the [[1975 NFL Season|1975]] season, Bradshaw threw for 209 yards, most of them to Swann, as the Steelers beat the [[Dallas Cowboys]], 21\u201317. His late-4th-quarter, 64-yard touchdown pass to Swann, released a split-second before defensive tackle [[Larry Cole]] flattened him, was selected by NFL Films as the \"Greatest Throw of All Time\".\n\nNeck and wrist injuries in 1976 forced Bradshaw to miss four games. He was sharp in a 40\u201314 victory over the [[Baltimore Colts]], completing 14 of 18 passes for 264 yards and three touchdowns, but the Steelers' hopes of a three-peat ended when both of their 1,000-yard rushers (Franco Harris and Rocky Bleier) were injured in the win over the Colts, and the Steelers subsequently lost to the Oakland Raiders in the AFC Championship game, 24-7. [[Jack Lambert (American football)|Jack Lambert]] asserted that that 1976 Steelers team was the best team that he ever played on, including the four Super Bowl teams of which he was a part.\n\nBradshaw had his finest season in [[1978 NFL Season|1978]] when he was named the NFL's [[National Football League Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] by the [[Associated Press]] after a season in which he completed 207 of 368 passes for 2,915 yards and a league-leading 28 touchdown passes. He was also named [[All-Pro]] and All-AFC that year, despite throwing 20 interceptions.\n\nBefore [[Super Bowl XIII]], a Steelers-Cowboys rematch, Cowboys [[linebacker]] [[Thomas \"Hollywood\" Henderson]] famously ridiculed Bradshaw by saying, \"He couldn't spell 'Cat' if you spotted him the 'c' and the 'a'.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/mike-tomlin-invokes-hollywood-henderson-to-perfectly-troll-terry-bradshaw/ | title=Mike Tomlin invokes 'Hollywood' Henderson to perfectly troll Terry Bradshaw | accessdate=January 20, 2019}}</ref> Bradshaw got his revenge by winning the [[Super Bowl MVP|Most Valuable Player]] award, completing 17 of 30 passes for a then-record 318 yards and four touchdowns in a 35\u201331 win. Bradshaw has in later years made light of the ridicule with quips such as \"it's football, not rocket science.\"\n\nBradshaw won his second straight Super Bowl MVP award in 1979 in [[Super Bowl XIV]]. He passed for 309 yards and two touchdowns in a 31\u201319 win over the [[Los Angeles Rams]]. Early in the fourth quarter, with Pittsburgh down 19\u201317, Bradshaw again turned to the long pass to help engineer a victory: a 73-yard touchdown to [[John Stallworth]]. Bradshaw shared ''Sports Illustrated'''s [[Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year|Sportsman of the Year]] award that season with fellow Pittsburgh star [[Willie Stargell]], whose [[1979 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pirates won the 1979 World Series]].\n\n[[File:1983 Steelers Police - 04 Terry Bradshaw (crop).jpg|thumb|left|Bradshaw playing with the Steelers in 1982|alt=]]\nAfter two seasons of missing the playoffs, Bradshaw played through pain\u2014he needed a cortisone shot before every game because of an elbow injury sustained during training camp\u2014in a strike-shortened [[1982 NFL season]]. He still managed to tie for the most touchdown passes in the league with 17. In a 31\u201328 playoff loss to the [[San Diego Chargers]], Bradshaw's last postseason game, he completed 28-of-39 passes for 325 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions.\n\nAfter undergoing off-season elbow surgery, Bradshaw was idle for the first 14 games of the 1983 NFL season. Then on December 10, 1983, against the [[New York Jets]], he felt a pop in his elbow while throwing his final pass, a 10-yard touchdown to [[Calvin Sweeney]] in the second quarter of the Steelers' 34\u20137 win. Bradshaw later left the game and never played again. The two touchdowns Bradshaw threw in what would be the final NFL game played at [[Shea Stadium]] (and the last NFL game played in [[New York City]] proper to date) allowed him to finish his career with two more touchdowns (212) than interceptions (210).\n{{Clear}}\n\nBradshaw's retirement came as a surprise to some,<ref name=\"Retirement\" /> and in hindsight unplanned on the Steelers' part.<ref name=\"30for30\">{{cite episode | title=Elway to Marino | series=30 for 30 | network=ESPN | airdate=2013-04-23 | season=2}}</ref> Before Bradshaw's elbow problems came about, the team chose to pass up [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pitt]] quarterback [[Dan Marino]] in the [[1983 NFL Draft]] as an heir successor to Bradshaw due in part to head coach [[Chuck Noll]] wanting to rebuild on defense and, according to [[Bill Hillgrove]], the [[Rooney family]] not wanting Marino to face a lot of pressure in his hometown and needing to experience life outside of [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland]], where Marino grew up and where Pitt is located.<ref name=\"30for30\" /> The player the Steelers drafted instead ([[Gabriel Rivera]]) only played six games before becoming a [[quadriplegic]] following a drunk driving accident, and Marino's subsequent success with the [[Miami Dolphins]] prompted [[Art Rooney]] to remind his sons daily until his death that the team \"should've drafted Marino.\"<ref name=\"30for30\" /> The decision also set the franchise back at quarterback: while the team would eventually return to being a Super Bowl contender after their rebuilding period during the mid-1980s, the team wouldn't have a consistent quarterback until [[Ben Roethlisberger]] arrived in 2004.\n\nAlthough the Steelers have not officially retired Bradshaw's number 12, they have not reissued it since his retirement and it is understood that no Steeler will ever wear it again.\n\n==After football==\nIn July 1997, Bradshaw served as the presenter when [[Mike Webster]], his center on the Steelers' Super Bowl XIII and XIV title teams, was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].\n\nIn 2006, despite the Steelers being one of the teams playing in the game, Bradshaw did not attend a pregame celebration for past Super Bowl MVP's during [[Super Bowl XL]] in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]. According to reports, Bradshaw (along with three time MVP and close friend [[Joe Montana]]) requested a US$100,000 guarantee for his appearance in the Super Bowl MVP Parade, and associated appearances. The NFL could not guarantee that they would make that much and refused. A representative for Bradshaw has since denied this report. After an appearance on [[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]] (February 6, 2006) Bradshaw stated that the reason why he did not attend the MVP parade was that he was spending time with family, that he hates the crowds and the Super Bowl media circus, and also that the only way he would attend a Super Bowl is when Fox is broadcasting the game (it was [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] who broadcast Super Bowl XL), though Bradshaw attended several press conferences in Detroit days earlier. Bradshaw also stated that money was not an issue.\n\nIn April 2006, Bradshaw donated his four Super Bowl rings, College Football Hall of Fame ring, Pro Football Hall of Fame ring, Hall of Fame bust, four miniature replica Super Bowl trophies, and a helmet and jersey from one of his Super Bowl victories to his alma mater, Louisiana Tech.\n\nOn November 5, 2007, during a nationally televised [[Monday Night Football]] game, Bradshaw joined former teammates including [[Franco Harris]] and [[Joe Greene (American football)|Joe Greene]] to accept their position on the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] 75th Anniversary All-Time Team.\n\n===Broadcasting career===\nBradshaw retired from football on July 24, 1984,<ref name=\"Retirement\">{{cite news|url=http://cover32.com/2016/07/05/day-terry-bradshaw-retired-steelers/|title=The day Terry Bradshaw retired from the Steelers|date=July 5, 2016|publisher=Cover32|accessdate=August 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827132451/http://cover32.com/2016/07/05/day-terry-bradshaw-retired-steelers/|archive-date=August 27, 2017|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref> and quickly signed a television contract with [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] to become an NFL game analyst in [[1984 NFL season|1984]], where he and play-by-play announcer [[Verne Lundquist]] had the top [[Nielsen ratings|rated]] programs.

In 1994, with the Fox network establishing its sports division with their purchase of NFL TV rights, Bradshaw joined ''Fox NFL Sunday'', where he normally acts as a [[foil (literature)|comic foil]] to his co-hosts. On ''Fox NFL Sunday'' he hosts two semi-regular features, ''Ten Yards with TB'', where he fires random questions at an NFL pro, and ''The Terry Awards'', an annual comedic award show about the NFL season. As a cross-promotional stunt, he also hosted two consecutive ''Digi-Bowl'' specials in 2001 and 2002 on [[Fox Kids]], providing commentary from the ''NFL on Fox'' studio in-between episodes of ''[[Digimon: Digital Monsters]]''; the 2002 special was the final one as the Fox Kids block ended the same year. He appeared on the first broadcast of ''[[NASCAR on FOX]]'' where he took a ride with [[Dale Earnhardt]] at [[Daytona International Speedway]] the night before Earnhardt was [[Death of Dale Earnhardt|killed in a last lap crash]] in the [[2001 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]].

The problem worsened in the late 1990s after his third divorce, when he said he \"could not bounce back\" as he had after the previous divorces or after a bad game. In addition to anxiety attacks, his symptoms included weight loss, frequent crying, and [[insomnia|sleeplessness]]. He was diagnosed with [[clinical depression]]. Since then he has taken [[Paroxetine|Paxil]] regularly. He chose to speak out about his depression to overcome the stigma associated with it and to urge others to seek help.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/spotlighthealth/2004-01-30-bradshaw_x.htm|work=[[USA Today]]|first1=John|last1=Morgan|title=Terry Bradshaw's winning drive against depression|date=January 30, 2004}}</ref>\n\nBradshaw's anxieties about appearing in public, away from the controlled environment of a television studio, led to an unintentional estrangement from the Steelers. When team founder and owner [[Art Rooney]] died in 1988, Bradshaw did not attend his funeral.

When the last regular season game was played there on December 16, 2000, Bradshaw was with the ''Fox NFL Sunday'' crew, doing their pre-game show aboard the aircraft carrier [[USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75)|USS ''Harry S. Truman'']], while Fox covered the game live. Bradshaw expressed regret that he could not be there, but would later say privately that he did not feel he could face the crowds.

He pleasantly joked with Jay about being a 'filler' guest. He made a similar reference in an appearance on March 15, 2010, stating he was asked to guest because of a cancellation. Jay stated that at least he was not appearing on Friday, which hosts the more well-known celebrity guests.
