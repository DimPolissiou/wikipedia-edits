He was capped 36 times for [[Italy national football team|Italy]], taking part at [[UEFA Euro 1988]] and the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], achieving semi-final finishes in both tournaments. In 1997, after 15 years at Sampdoria, Mancini left the club to join [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]], where he won a further ''[[List of Italian football champions|Scudetto]]'', as well as the Cup Winners' Cup, the [[UEFA Super Cup]] and two more Coppa Italia titles.\n\nAs a player, Mancini would often give team talks at [[half-time]].

With limited resources during his two-season tenure, he guided the club to another Coppa Italia.\n\nIn 2004, Mancini was given the chance to manage a major club with more resources when he was offered the manager's job at Inter.

He also appeared in the [[1992 European Cup Final|final]] of the [[1991\u201392 European Cup]] against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]. At 27, Mancini sat on the interview panel that selected [[Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson]] as manager. Mancini often delivered the team-talk for Sampdoria. He attended board meetings and had a say in transfer business. In [[David Platt (footballer)|David Platt]]'s 1995 autobiography, ''Achieving the Goal'', he described the day he met Sampdoria in Genoa while playing for [[A.S. Bari|Bari]] and, lining up in the tunnel, became aware that Mancini was looking his way. Platt wrote: \"I thought nothing of it until he asked me, very matter-of-factly, if I was staying at Bari. Outright he asked if I wanted to join Sampdoria. Mancini had been at the club years and was almost a son to the president, Paolo Mantovani.\" Mancini kept in touch when Platt moved to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and eventually helped bring him to Sampdoria. At that stage, Mancini had established himself as the most powerful voice in the ''Blucerchiati'' dressing room.\n\nAs a teenager at Sampdoria, Mancini was not someone who liked his authority being questioned. After [[Trevor Francis]] signed from [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in 1982, aggrieved that his place was under threat, the 18-year-old Mancini ended up picking a fight with 28-year-old Francis on the training ground. A similar incident occurred with [[Liam Brady]], who was eight years older. Additionally, [[Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n]] tells the story of swearing in Mancini's direction during an argument about a badly-taken corner. After the match, Mancini had stripped off to the waist and was waiting to fight him. \"He is not an easy person, you know,\" Ver\u00f3n says. \"He has this complicated personality.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/jan/06/roberto-mancini-sir-alex-ferguson?INTCMP=SRCH | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Daniel | last=Taylor | title=Roberto Mancini is Manchester City's very own Sir Alex Ferguson | date=6 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Lazio===\nWith [[S.S.

He joined Lazio's coaching staff as Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson's number two. In 2011, when asked about Mancini, Eriksson said, \"I took him to Lazio with me and he wanted to be a manager even while he was a player. He was the coach, he was the kit man, he was the bus driver, everything. At Sampdoria he wanted to check that everything was in place before training.

Inter became the dominant team in Italy. In Mancini's first season, Inter won the [[2004\u201305 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] with a 3\u20130 victory over [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] at the [[San Siro]]. Inter finished third in [[2003\u201304 Serie A]] and reached the [[2004\u201305 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] [[2004\u201305 UEFA Champions League#Quarter-finals|quarter-finals]] only to be knocked out by city rivals [[A.C. Milan]] 3\u20130 on aggregate.\n\nIn August 2005, Inter won the [[2005 Supercoppa Italiana]] for the second time in their history with a 1\u20130 victory over [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]. Inter again won the [[2005\u201306 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] and [[2006 Supercoppa Italiana|Italian Super Cup]]. Following the ''[[Calciopoli]]'' scandal, [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] were stripped of the ''[[List of Italian football champions|Scudetto]]'' title, which was handed to Inter instead. Inter achieved a record-breaking run of 17 consecutive victories in [[2006\u201307 Serie A|Serie A]], starting on 25 September 2006, with a 4\u20131 home win over [[A.S. Livorno Calcio|Livorno]] and ending on 28 February 2007 after a 1\u20131 draw at home to [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]]. The run lasted for almost five months and is among the best in [[UEFA|European league football history]]. Inter won a [[2006\u201307 Serie A|second successive league title]] with five games to spare and only losing one league game all season. Inter finished with a record-breaking 97 points.\n\nMancini became the third coach in [[History of Inter Milan|Inter history]] to win back-to-back league titles after [[Alfredo Foni]]; [[1952\u201353 Serie A|1952\u201353]] and [[1953\u201354 Serie A|1953\u201354]] and [[Helenio Herrera]]; [[1964\u201365 Serie A|1964\u201365]] and [[1965\u201366 Serie A|1965\u201366]]). Inter also progressed to the [[2006\u201307 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] and [[2007 Supercoppa Italiana|Italian Super Cup]] for the third consecutive season, but were beaten in both finals by [[A.S. Roma|Roma]]. Once again, however, Inter struggled in [[UEFA|Europe]]. In the [[2006\u201307 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], they were knocked out in the [[2006\u201307 UEFA Champions League#First knockout round|first knockout round]] by [[Valencia CF|Valencia]].

This was Mancini's fourth, and final, season in charge of Inter. His reputation continued to grow as he added a third consecutive [[2007\u201308 Serie A|Serie A title]] to his honours. Again he guided Inter to the [[2007\u201308 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia final]], but lost for a second consecutive season to Roma, 2\u20131, at the [[Stadio Olimpico]].\n\nDespite his successes, the inability to make any real progress in the Champions League displeased Inter owner [[Massimo Moratti]].

As a player, Mancini operated as a [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|deep-lying forward]], and was best known for his time at [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]], where he played more than 550 matches, and helped the team win the [[Serie A]] league title, four [[Coppa Italia]] titles, and the [[European Cup Winners' Cup]]. He was capped 36 times for [[Italy national football team|Italy]], taking part at [[UEFA Euro 1988]] and the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], achieving semi-final finishes in both tournaments. In 1997, after 15 years at Sampdoria, Mancini left the club to join [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]], where he won a further ''[[List of Italian football champions|Scudetto]]'', as well as the Cup Winners' Cup, the [[UEFA Super Cup]] and two more Coppa Italia titles.\n\nAs a player, Mancini would often give team talks at [[half-time]]. Towards the end of his playing career he became an assistant to [[Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson]] at Lazio.<ref>{{cite web |title=FA Cup special: The Roberto Mancini story |last=Whalley |first=Mike |quote=He was the club captain, he often gave the team talks and he even helped to design the kit. |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/sport/football/manchester_city/s/1420688_fa-cup-special-the-roberto-mancini-story |date=13 May 2011 |accessdate=13 May 2011}}</ref> His first manager role was at a cash-stricken [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] at only 35 years old. He won a Coppa Italia there, but left with the team facing bankruptcy. Months later he took over as manager at Lazio, where again he inherited financial constraints and was forced to lose a number of key players. With limited resources during his two-season tenure, he guided the club to another Coppa Italia.\n\nIn 2004, Mancini was given the chance to manage a major club with more resources when he was offered the manager's job at Inter. During his first tenure at Inter, the club won three consecutive Serie A titles, an Inter club record, and an [[Football records in Italy#Most consecutive wins|Italian record 17 consecutive league game victories]] stretching nearly half a season; Mancini became Inter's most successful manager in 30 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/03/01/1860120.htm |title=Inter's winning run ends in draw with Udinese |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=1 March 2007 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Football managers who never get the job \u2013 Mancini was Inter Milan's most successful manager in 30 years | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/shortlisted-football-managers-who-never-get-the-job-1821650.html?action=Popup&ino=8 | publisher=Independent Online | location=London | first=Simon | last=Rice | date=16 November 2009}}</ref> Despite his domestic success, many pundits saw the repeated failure to win the coveted [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] as the main reason for his dismissal in 2008.\n\nAfter being out of football for over a year, Mancini was appointed [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] manager in December 2009.<ref name=\"tactics\">{{cite news |title=Younger the better for Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/english-football/younger-the-better-for-manchester-city-manager-roberto-mancini-1.1045178 |publisher=heraldscotland.com |date=1 August 2010 |accessdate=1 August 2010}}</ref> Under his stewardship, he instilled a winning culture at the club, taking Manchester City from a mid-table club to the top level of English football, combining defensive solidity with attacking flair.

He also appeared in the [[1992 European Cup Final|final]] of the [[1991\u201392 European Cup]] against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]. At 27, Mancini sat on the interview panel that selected [[Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson]] as manager. Mancini often delivered the team-talk for Sampdoria. He attended board meetings and had a say in transfer business. In [[David Platt (footballer)|David Platt]]'s 1995 autobiography, ''Achieving the Goal'', he described the day he met Sampdoria in Genoa while playing for [[A.S. Bari|Bari]] and, lining up in the tunnel, became aware that Mancini was looking his way. Platt wrote: \"I thought nothing of it until he asked me, very matter-of-factly, if I was staying at Bari. Outright he asked if I wanted to join Sampdoria. Mancini had been at the club years and was almost a son to the president, Paolo Mantovani.\" Mancini kept in touch when Platt moved to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and eventually helped bring him to Sampdoria. At that stage, Mancini had established himself as the most powerful voice in the ''Blucerchiati'' dressing room.\n\nAs a teenager at Sampdoria, Mancini was not someone who liked his authority being questioned. After [[Trevor Francis]] signed from [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in 1982, aggrieved that his place was under threat, the 18-year-old Mancini ended up picking a fight with 28-year-old Francis on the training ground. A similar incident occurred with [[Liam Brady]], who was eight years older. Additionally, [[Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n]] tells the story of swearing in Mancini's direction during an argument about a badly-taken corner. After the match, Mancini had stripped off to the waist and was waiting to fight him. \"He is not an easy person, you know,\" Ver\u00f3n says. \"He has this complicated personality.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/jan/06/roberto-mancini-sir-alex-ferguson?INTCMP=SRCH | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Daniel | last=Taylor | title=Roberto Mancini is Manchester City's very own Sir Alex Ferguson | date=6 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Lazio===\nWith [[S.S.

In the [[1999\u20132000 Serie A|1999\u201300 season]], Lazio won the ''Scudetto'' and [[1999\u20132000 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]], but Mancini failed to score in 20 matches and later announced his playing retirement. He joined Lazio's coaching staff as Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson's number two. In 2011, when asked about Mancini, Eriksson said, \"I took him to Lazio with me and he wanted to be a manager even while he was a player. He was the coach, he was the kit man, he was the bus driver, everything. At Sampdoria he wanted to check that everything was in place before training. Sometimes I would have to tell him: 'Mancio, you have a game to play on Sunday, you will be exhausted if you have to control everything.'

Inter became the dominant team in Italy. In Mancini's first season, Inter won the [[2004\u201305 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] with a 3\u20130 victory over [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] at the [[San Siro]]. Inter finished third in [[2003\u201304 Serie A]] and reached the [[2004\u201305 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] [[2004\u201305 UEFA Champions League#Quarter-finals|quarter-finals]] only to be knocked out by city rivals [[A.C.

Following the ''[[Calciopoli]]'' scandal, [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] were stripped of the ''[[List of Italian football champions|Scudetto]]'' title, which was handed to Inter instead.

The run lasted for almost five months and is among the best in [[UEFA|European league football history]]. Inter won a [[2006\u201307 Serie A|second successive league title]] with five games to spare and only losing one league game all season. Inter finished with a record-breaking 97 points.\n\nMancini became the third coach in [[History of Inter Milan|Inter history]] to win back-to-back league titles after [[Alfredo Foni]]; [[1952\u201353 Serie A|1952\u201353]] and [[1953\u201354 Serie A|1953\u201354]] and [[Helenio Herrera]]; [[1964\u201365 Serie A|1964\u201365]] and [[1965\u201366 Serie A|1965\u201366]]).

In Mancini's first full season in charge at City, they conceded 33 goals in the Premier League, the fewest along with Chelsea and 18 clean sheets, the highest in the [[2010\u201311 Premier League|2010\u201311 Premier League season]].\n\nMancini's training methods have been criticised by some City players<ref>{{cite news |title=Carlos Tevez criticizes Roberto Mancini's training methods |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/apr/13/carlos-tevez-criticises-roberto-mancini |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date=13 April 2010 |accessdate=26 September 2010 | location=London | first=Daniel | last=Taylor}}</ref> and especially by ex-Manchester City fitness coach [[Raymond Verheijen]], who is a personal fitness coach for [[Craig Bellamy]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Ex-coach attacks Roberto Mancini's 'crazy' training at Manchester City |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/sep/23/roberto-mancini-training-methods-manchester-city |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date=23 September 2010 |accessdate=26 September 2010 | location=London | first=Daniel | last=Taylor}}</ref> During his time at City, Mancini tried to stamp his authority with rebellious players who were not performing well and has stated, \"If a top player is not happy then it's better to go.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Roberto Mancini tells Carlos Tevez to shape up or ship out of City |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/apr/29/roberto-mancini-carlos-tevez-city-manchester |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date=29 April 2010 |accessdate=26 September 2010 | location=London | first=Daniel | last=Taylor}}</ref>\n\nMancini is known to use the media to alleviate the pressure from his players.

In particular, the following areas exhibit a high degree of topographical variety: the eastern Midwest near the foothills of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]; the [[Great Lakes Basin]]; the heavily glaciated uplands of the [[North Shore (Lake Superior)|North Shore of Lake Superior]] in Minnesota, part of the ruggedly volcanic [[Canadian Shield]]; the [[Ozark Mountains]] of southern Missouri; and the deeply eroded [[Driftless Area]] of southwest Wisconsin, southeast Minnesota, northeast Iowa, and northwest Illinois.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nProceeding westward, the [[Appalachian Plateau]] topography gradually gives way to gently rolling hills and then (in central Ohio) to flat lands converted principally to farms and urban areas. This is the beginning of the vast Interior Plains of North America. As a result, [[prairie]]s cover most of the Great Plains states. Iowa and much of Illinois lie within an area called the ''prairie peninsula'', an eastward extension of prairies that borders [[conifer]] and mixed forests to the north, and [[hardwood]] [[deciduous]] forests to the east and south.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nGeographers subdivide the Interior Plains into the Interior Lowlands and the Great Plains on the basis of elevation. The Lowlands are mostly below {{convert|1,500|ft|m}} above sea level whereas the Great Plains to the west are higher, rising in [[Colorado]] to around {{convert|5,000|ft|m}}.\nThe Lowlands, then, are confined to parts of Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, [[Tennessee]], and [[Kentucky]]. Missouri and [[Arkansas]] have regions of Lowlands elevations, contrasting with their Ozark region (within the Interior Highlands). Eastern Ohio's hills are an extension of the Appalachian Plateau.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe Interior Plains are largely coincident with the vast [[Mississippi River]] Drainage System (other major components are the [[Missouri River|Missouri]] and Ohio Rivers). These rivers have for tens of millions of years been eroding downward into the mostly horizontal sedimentary rocks of [[Paleozoic]], [[Mesozoic]], and [[Cenozoic]] ages. The modern Mississippi River system has developed during the Pleistocene Epoch of the Cenozoic.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nRainfall decreases from east to west, resulting in different types of prairies, with the [[tallgrass prairie]] in the wetter eastern region, mixed-grass prairie in the central [[Great Plains]], and [[shortgrass prairie]] towards the [[rain shadow]] of the Rockies. Today, these three prairie types largely correspond to the [[Maize|corn]]/[[soybean]] area, the [[wheat]] belt, and the western rangelands, respectively.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nMuch of the [[coniferous forests]] of the Upper Midwest were clear-cut in the late 19th century, and mixed hardwood forests have become a major component of the new woodlands since then.

They brought with them a well-developed agricultural complex based on three major crops\u2014[[maize]], [[beans]], and [[squash (plant)|squash]]. Maize, or corn, was the primary crop of Mississippian farmers. They gathered a wide variety of seeds, nuts, and berries, and fished and hunted for fowl to supplement their diets. With such an intensive form of [[agriculture]], this culture supported large populations.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe Mississippi period was characterized by a [[mound builder (people)|mound-building]] culture. The Mississippians suffered a tremendous population decline about 1400, coinciding with the global climate change of the [[Little Ice Age]].

They made canoes for fishing. Most of them lived in oval or conical [[wigwam]]s that could be easily moved away. Various tribes had different ways of living. The Ojibwas were primarily hunters and fishing was also important in the Ojibwas economy. Other tribes such as Sac, Fox, and Miami, both hunted and farmed.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThey were oriented toward the open prairies where they engaged in communal hunts for [[American Bison|buffalo (bison)]]. In the northern forests, the Ottawas and Potawatomis separated into small family groups for hunting. The Winnebagos and Menominees used both hunting methods interchangeably and built up widespread trade networks extending as far west as the Rockies, north to the Great Lakes, south to the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and east to the [[Atlantic Ocean]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe Hurons reckoned descent through the female line, while the others favored the patrilineal method. All tribes were governed under chiefdoms or complex chiefdoms. For example, Hurons were divided into matrilineal clans, each represented by a chief in the town council, where they met with a town chief on civic matters. But Chippewa people's social and political life was simpler than that of settled tribes.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe religious beliefs varied among tribes. Hurons believed in ''Yoscaha'', a supernatural being who lived in the sky and was believed to have created the world and the Huron people. At death, Hurons thought the soul left the body to live in a village in the sky. Chippewas were a deeply religious people who believed in the Great Spirit. They worshiped the Great Spirit through all their seasonal activities, and viewed religion as a private matter: Each person's relation with his personal guardian spirit was part of his thinking every day of life. Ottawa and Potawatomi people had very similar religious beliefs to those of the Chippewas.<ref name=Midwestlit />\n\nIn the Ohio River Valley, the dominant food supply was not hunting but agriculture.

Some tribes are described as part of the 'Buffalo Culture' (sometimes called, for the [[American Bison]]). Although the Plains Indians hunted other animals, such as [[elk]] or [[Pronghorn|antelope]], bison was their primary game food source. Bison flesh, hide, and bones from [[Bison hunting]] provided the chief source of raw materials for items that Plains Indians made, including food, cups, decorations, crafting tools, knives, and clothing.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe tribes followed the bison's seasonal grazing and migration. The Plains Indians lived in [[teepees]] because they were easily disassembled and allowed the nomadic life of following game. When [[Spain|Spanish]] [[horse]]s were obtained, the Plains tribes rapidly integrated them into their daily lives. By the early 18th century, many tribes had fully adopted a [[horse culture]].

Most of them started as farmers, but later the larger proportion moved to towns and cities as entrepreneurs, businessmen, and urban professionals. Since its beginnings in the 1830s, Chicago has grown to dominate the Midwestern metropolis landscape for over a century.<ref>\"Yankees\" in Reiff, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Chicago''</ref>\n\nHistorian John Bunker has examined the worldview of the Yankee settlers in the Midwest:\n\n<blockquote>Because they arrived first and had a strong sense of community and mission, Yankees were able to transplant New England institutions, values, and mores, altered only by the conditions of frontier life. They established a public culture that emphasized the work ethic, the sanctity of private property, individual responsibility, faith in residential and social mobility, practicality, piety, public order and decorum, reverence for public education, activists, honest, and frugal government, town meeting democracy, and he believed that there was a public interest that transcends particular and stick ambitions. Regarding themselves as the elect and just in a world rife with sin, air, and corruption, they felt a strong moral obligation to define and enforce standards of community and personal behavior....This pietistic worldview was substantially shared by British, Scandinavian, Swiss, English-Canadian and Dutch Reformed immigrants, as well as by German Protestants and many of the Forty-Eighters.<ref>John Buenker, \"Wisconsin\" in {{cite book|last=James H. Madison, ed. |title=Heartland: Comparative Histories of the Midwestern States |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TMUCo0UXCjoC&pg=PA72|year=1988|publisher=Indiana University Press|pages=72\u201373|isbn=978-0253314239}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMidwestern politics pitted Yankees against the German Catholics and Lutherans, who were often led by the Irish Catholics. These large groups, Buenker argues:\n\n<blockquote>Generally subscribed to the work ethic, a strong sense of community, and activist government, but were less committed to economic individualism and privatism and ferociously opposed to government supervision of the personal habits. Southern and eastern European immigrants generally leaned more toward the Germanic view of things, while modernization, industrialization, and urbanization modified nearly everyone's sense of individual economic responsibility and put a premium on organization, political involvement, and education.<ref>John Buenker, \"Wisconsin\"</ref><ref>Richard J. Jensen, ''Illinois: a Bicentennial history'' (1977) ch 1-3</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Development of transportation ===\n==== Waterways ====\n[[File:LightningVolt Lake Michigan Sunset.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lake Michigan]] is shared by four Midwestern states: Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin.]]\nThree waterways have been important to the development of the Midwest. The first and foremost was the [[Ohio River]], which flowed into the [[Mississippi River]]. Development of the region was halted until 1795 by [[Spain]]'s control of the southern part of the Mississippi and its refusal to allow the shipment of American crops down the river and into the [[Atlantic Ocean]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe second waterway is the network of routes within the Great Lakes. The opening of the [[Erie Canal]] in 1825 completed an all-water shipping route, more direct than the Mississippi, to [[New York (state)|New York]] and the seaport of [[New York City]]. In 1848, The [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]] breached the [[continental divide]] spanning the [[Chicago Portage]] and linking the waters of the Great Lakes with those of the [[Mississippi Valley]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Lakeport and river cities grew up to handle these new shipping routes. During the [[Industrial Revolution]], the lakes became a conduit for [[iron ore]] from the [[Mesabi Range]] of Minnesota to [[steel mill]]s in the [[Mid-Atlantic States]]. The [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]], completed in 1959, opened the Midwest to the Atlantic Ocean.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/places/united-states-and-canada/canadian-physical-geography/saint-lawrence-seaway|title=Saint Lawrence Seaway|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe third waterway, the [[Missouri River]], extended water travel from the Mississippi almost to the Rocky Mountains.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n[[File:Efmo View from Fire Point.jpg|thumb|The [[Upper Mississippi River]] near [[Harpers Ferry, Iowa]]]]\nIn the 1870s and 1880s, the Mississippi River inspired two classic books\u2014''[[Life on the Mississippi]]'' and ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]''\u2014written by native Missourian Samuel Clemens, who used the pseudonym [[Mark Twain]]. His stories became staples of Midwestern lore. Twain's hometown of [[Hannibal, Missouri]], is a tourist attraction offering a glimpse into the Midwest of his time.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nInland canals in Ohio and Indiana constituted another important waterway, which connected with Great Lakes and Ohio River traffic. The commodities that the Midwest funneled into the [[Erie Canal]] down the Ohio River contributed to the wealth of New York City, which overtook [[Boston]] and [[Philadelphia]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==== Railroads and the automobile ====\nDuring the mid-19th century, the region got its first railroads, and the railroad junction in Chicago became the world's largest. During the century, Chicago became the nation's railroad center. By 1910, over 20 railroads operated passenger service out of six different downtown terminals. Even today, a century after [[Henry Ford]], six [[Class I railroad]]s meet in Chicago.{{sfnp|Condit|1973|pp=43-49, 58, 318-319}}<ref>{{Holland-Classic|pages = 66\u201391}}</ref>\n\nIn the period from 1890 to 1930, many Midwestern cities were connected by electric [[interurban]] railroads, similar to streetcars.

The regional southern boundary was the Ohio River, the border of freedom and slavery in American history and literature (see ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] and ''[[Beloved (novel)|Beloved]]'' by [[Toni Morrison]]).\n\nThe Midwest, particularly Ohio, provided the primary routes for the ''[[Underground Railroad]]'', whereby Midwesterners assisted slaves to freedom from their crossing of the Ohio River through their departure on [[Lake Erie]] to Canada. Created in the early 19th century, the Underground Railroad was at its height between 1850 and 1860. One estimate suggests that by 1850, 100,000 slaves had escaped via the Underground Railroad.<ref name=\"afroamhistory\">[http://afroamhistory.about.com/od/undergroundrailroad/a/undergroundrr.htm The Fugitive Slave Law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125175114/http://afroamhistory.about.com/od/undergroundrailroad/a/undergroundrr.htm |date=25 January 2009 }} African-American History, pp. 1\u20132. About.com</ref>\n\nThe Underground Railroad consisted of meeting points, secret routes, transportation, and safe houses and assistance provided by abolitionist sympathizers. Individuals were often organized in small, independent groups; this helped to maintain secrecy because individuals knew some connecting \"stations\" along the route, but knew few details of their immediate area. Escaped slaves would move north along the route from one way station to the next. Although the fugitives sometimes traveled on boat or train, they usually traveled on foot or by wagon.<ref>Bordewich, Fergus, 2005, p. 236</ref>\n\nThe region was shaped by the relative absence of slavery (except for Missouri), pioneer settlement, education in [[one-room school|one-room free public schools]], democratic notions brought by [[American Revolutionary War]] veterans, [[Protestant]] faiths and experimentation, and agricultural wealth transported on the Ohio River [[riverboat]]s, [[flatboat]]s, [[Barge|canal boats]], and [[rail transport|railroads]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\n==== Bleeding Kansas ====\n{{Main|Bleeding Kansas}}\n\nThe first violent conflicts leading up to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] occurred between two neighboring Midwestern states, Kansas and Missouri, involving [[Abolitionism in the United States|anti-slavery]] [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-Staters]] and pro-slavery \"[[Border Ruffian]]\" elements, that took place in the [[Kansas Territory]] and the western frontier towns of Missouri roughly between 1854 and 1858. At the heart of the conflict was the question of whether Kansas would enter the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] as a free state or slave state. As such, [[Bleeding Kansas]] was a [[proxy war]] between [[Northern United States|Northerners]] and [[Southern United States|Southerners]] over the issue of [[slavery in the United States|slavery]]. The term \"Bleeding Kansas\" was coined by [[Horace Greeley]] of the ''[[New York Tribune]]''; the events it encompasses directly presaged the Civil War.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n[[File:Bleeding Kansas Poster.jpg|thumb|upright|1855 [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-State]] poster]]\nSetting in motion the events later known as \"Bleeding Kansas\" was the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854|Kansas-Nebraska Act]]. The Act created the territories of Kansas and Nebraska, opened new lands that would help settlement in them, repealed the [[Missouri Compromise of 1820|Missouri Compromise]], and allowed settlers in those territories to determine through [[Popular sovereignty in the United States|popular sovereignty]] whether to allow slavery within their boundaries. It was hoped the Act would ease relations between the North and the South, because the South could expand slavery to new territories, but the North still had the right to abolish slavery in its states. Instead, opponents denounced the law as a concession to the [[The Slave Power|slave power]] of the South.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe new [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], born in the Midwest ([[Ripon, Wisconsin]], 1854) and created in opposition to the Act, aimed to stop the expansion of slavery, and soon emerged as the dominant force throughout the North.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masslive.com/history/index.ssf/2011/05/springfields_375th_from_puritans_to_presidents.html|title=Springfield's 375th: From Puritans to presidents|website=Masslive.com|access-date=2017-07-16}}</ref>\n\nAn ostensibly [[democracy|democratic]] idea, popular sovereignty stated that the inhabitants of each territory or state should decide whether it would be a free or slave state; however, this resulted in immigration ''en masse'' to Kansas by activists from both sides. At one point, Kansas had two separate governments, each with its own constitution, although only one was federally recognized. On January 29, 1861, Kansas was admitted to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] as a free state, less than three months before the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]] officially began the Civil War.<ref>Robert W.

Because the Northwest Territory lay between the East Coast and the then-far-West, the states carved out of it were called the ''Northwest''. In the early 19th century, anything west of the Mississippi River was considered the West. The first recorded use of the term ''Midwestern'' to refer to a region of the central U.S. occurred in 1886, ''Midwest'' appeared in 1894, and ''Midwesterner'' in 1916.<ref name=\"oed.com\">[[Oxford English Dictionary]] entries for ''Midwestern'', ''Midwest'', and ''Midwesterner'', http://www.oed.com/</ref>\n\nSome maintain that only the areas that made up the Northwest Territory can truly be called the Midwest, and that all other areas to the west should be properly labeled as part of the \"Great Plains\" region instead.

divided states often deciding the national result. In 1860\u20131920, both parties often selected either their president or vice president from the region.<ref>{{cite book |first=Lewis L. |last=Gould |title=Grand Old Party: A History of the Republicans |edition=2nd |year=2012 |page=126 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Little White Schoolhouse Ripon Wisconsin Feb 2012.jpg|thumb|The first local meeting of the new Republican Party took place here in [[Ripon, Wisconsin]] on March 20, 1854.]]\nOne of the two major political parties in the United States, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], originated in the Midwest in the 1850s; Ripon, Wisconsin had the first local meeting while [[Jackson, Michigan]] had the state county meeting of the new party. Its membership included many [[Yankee]]s who had settled the upper Midwest. The party opposed the expansion of slavery and stressed the Protestant ideals of thrift, a hard work ethic, self-reliance, democratic decision making, and religious tolerance.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gould |title=Grand Old Party: A History of the Republicans |edition=2nd |year=2012 |page=14 }}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1890s the wheat-growing regions were strongholds of the short-lived [[People's Party (United States)|Populist movement]] in the Plains states.<ref>{{cite book |first=Russel B. |last=Nye |title=Midwestern Progressive Politics |year=1968 }}</ref>\n\nStarting in the 1890s the middle class urban [[Progressive movement]] became influential in the region (as it was in other regions), with Wisconsin a major center. Under the [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|La Follettes]] Wisconsin fought against the GOP bosses and for efficiency, modernization, and the use of experts to solve social, economic, and political problems. Theodore Roosevelt's [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|1912 Progressive Party]] had the best showing in this region; carrying the states of Michigan, Minnesota, and South Dakota. In 1924, La Follette, Sr.'s [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924\u201334)|1924 Progressive Party]] did well in the region, but only carried his home base of Wisconsin.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe Midwest\u2014especially the areas west of Chicago\u2014has always been a stronghold of [[United States non-interventionism|isolationism]], a belief that America should not involve itself in foreign entanglements. This position was largely based on the many [[German American]] and [[Swedish-American]] communities. Isolationist leaders included the La Follettes, Ohio's [[Robert A. Taft]], and [[Robert R. McCormick|Colonel Robert McCormick]], publisher of the ''Chicago Tribune''.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Ralph H. |last=Smuckler |title=The Region of Isolationism |journal=[[American Political Science Review]] |year=1953 |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=386\u2013401 |jstor=1952029 |doi=10.2307/1952029 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=John N. |last=Schacht |title=Three Faces of Midwestern Isolationism: Gerald P.

Upper Midwestern states of Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin reliably voted Democratic in every presidential election from 1992 to 2012. The Great Plains states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas have voted for the Republican candidate in every presidential election since 1940, except for Democrat [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]]. Indiana is usually considered a Republican stronghold, voting that party's presidential candidate in every election since 1940, except for Johnson in 1964 and [[Barack Obama]] in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |title=Election Statistics, 1920 to Present |url=http://history.house.gov/Institution/Election-Statistics/Election-Statistics/ |website=History, Art & Archives: US House of Representatives |accessdate=30 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the 2016 elections, Republicans controlled the governors' office in all Midwestern states except Minnesota and the Republicans also controlled every partisan state legislature in the Midwest except [[Illinois state legislature|Illinois]]. The unicameral [[Nebraska Legislature]] is officially nonpartisan.<ref>{{cite web |title=Unicam Focus |url=https://nebraskalegislature.gov/education/lesson3.php |website=Nebraska Legislature |accessdate=30 July 2018}}</ref> In 2018, however, the Democrats made a significant comeback by flipping the gubernatorial elections in [[Illinois gubernatorial election, 2018|Illinois]], [[Kansas gubernatorial election, 2018|Kansas]], [[Michigan gubernatorial election, 2018|Michigan]] and [[Wisconsin gubernatorial election, 2018|Wisconsin]]. The Democrats also flipped the [[Minnesota House of Representatives]] after losing control in [[United States elections, 2014|2014]].\n\nThe state government of Illinois currently has a Democratic Governor [[J. B. Pritzker|J.B. Pritzker]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] super majorities in the state house and state senate. The state currently has two Democratic senators, and a 13\u20135 Democratic majority U.S. House of Representatives delegation.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nMany analysts{{who|date=May 2016}} consider Iowa the most evenly divided state in the country, but it has leaned Democratic for at least the past fifteen years.{{when|date=May 2016}} Iowa had a Democratic governor from 1999 until [[Terry Branstad]] was re-elected in the mid-term elections in 2010, and has had both one Democratic and one Republican senator since the early 1980s until the 2014 election when Republican [[Joni Ernst]] defeated Democrat [[Bruce Braley]] in a tightly contested race.<ref>{{cite web|title = Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|url = http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/|website = uselectionatlas.org|access-date = 2016-02-15|first = David|last = Leip}}</ref> As for Iowa's House delegation, Democrats currently hold a 3 to 1 seat majority as a result of the 2018 elections. Between 1992 and 2012, Iowa also voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in all elections except 2004, but in 2016 the state went to the Republicans by 10 percentage points. As a result of the 2016 elections, Republicans hold a majority in the [[Iowa House of Representatives]] and the [[Iowa Senate]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nMinnesota voters have not voted for a Republican candidate for president since 1972, longer than any other state. Minnesota was the only U.S. state (along with Washington, D.C.) to vote for its native son [[Walter Mondale]] over [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1984. However, the recent{{when|date=May 2016}} Democratic victories have often been fairly narrow, such as the 2016 Presidential Election. Minnesota also elected and re-elected a Republican governor ([[Tim Pawlenty]]), as well as supported some of the strongest [[Concealed carry in the United States|gun concealment]] laws in the nation.\n\nConsistently, Ohio is a battleground state in presidential elections. No Republican has won the office without winning Ohio. This trend has contributed to Ohio's reputation as a quintessential swing state. At the state level, however, Republicans are currently dominant. With the exception of one justice of the [[Supreme Court of Ohio]], all political offices open to statewide election are held by Republicans. Republicans have a majority in the [[Ohio House of Representatives]] and a supermajority in the [[Ohio Senate]]. At the federal level, Ohio currently has one Democratic and one Republican U.S. Senator.{{when|date=May 2016}} As a result of the 2012 elections, 12 of Ohio's 16 members of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] are Republicans.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe Great Plains states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas have been strongholds for the Republicans for many decades. These four states have gone for the Republican candidate in every presidential election since 1940, except for [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s landslide over [[Barry Goldwater]] in [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]]. Although North Dakota and South Dakota have often elected Democrats to Congress, after the 2012 election both states' congressional delegations are majority Republican. Nebraska has elected Democrats to the Senate and as governor in recent years, but both of its senators are Republican.{{when|date=May 2016}} Kansas has elected a majority of Democrats as governor since 1956, but has not elected a Democratic senator since 1932. Both of Kansas's U.S. Senators and all four of its U.S. House members are Republican.{{when|date=May 2016}}\n\nMissouri was historically considered a \"bellwether state\", having voted for the winner in every presidential election since 1904, with three exceptions: in [[1956 United States presidential election|1956]] for Democrat [[Adlai Stevenson II]]; in [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]] for Republican [[John McCain]]; and in [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]] for Republican [[Mitt Romney]]. Missouri's House delegation has generally been evenly divided, with the Democrats holding sway in the large cities at the opposite ends of the state, Kansas City and St. Louis (although the Kansas City suburbs are now trending Republican), and the Republicans controlling the rest of the state, save for a pocket of Democratic strength in [[Columbia, Missouri|Columbia]], home to the [[University of Missouri]]. However, as a result of the 2012 elections, Republicans now have a 6\u20132 majority in the state's House delegation, with African-American Democrats representing the major cities. Missouri's Senate seats were mostly controlled by Democrats until the latter part of the 20th century, but the Republicans have held one or both Senate seats continuously since 1976.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nAll Midwestern states use primary election to select delegates for both the Democratic and Republican national conventions, except for Iowa. The [[Iowa caucuses]] in early January of leap years are the first votes in the [[United States presidential election|presidential nominating process]] for both major parties, and attract enormous media attention.<ref>David P.

The states of the Old Northwest are also known as ''[[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes states]]'' and are east-north central in the United States. The Ohio River runs along the southeastern section while the Mississippi River runs north to south near the center. Many of the Louisiana Purchase states in the west-north central United States, are also known as the '''Great Plains states''', where the Missouri River is a major waterway joining with the Mississippi. The Midwest lies north of the [[Parallel 36\u00b030\u2032 north|36\u00b030\u2032 parallel]] that the 1820 [[Missouri Compromise]] established as the dividing line between future [[Slave and free states|slave and non-slave states]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe Midwest Region is defined by the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] as these 12 states:<ref name=census.gov />\n* '''[[Illinois]]:''' Old Northwest, Mississippi River (Missouri River joins near the state border), Ohio River, and Great Lakes state\n* '''[[Indiana]]:''' Old Northwest, Ohio River, and Great Lakes state\n* '''[[Iowa]]:''' Louisiana Purchase, Mississippi River, and Missouri River state\n* '''[[Kansas]]:''' Louisiana Purchase, Great Plains, and Missouri River state\n* '''[[Michigan]]:''' Old Northwest and Great Lakes state\n* '''[[Minnesota]]:''' Old Northwest, Louisiana Purchase, Mississippi River, part of [[Red River Colony]] before 1818, Great Lakes state\n* '''[[Missouri]]:''' Louisiana Purchase, Mississippi River (Ohio River joins near the state border), Missouri River, and [[Border states (American Civil War)|border]] state\n* '''[[Nebraska]]:''' Louisiana Purchase, Great Plains, and Missouri River state\n* '''[[North Dakota]]:''' Louisiana Purchase, part of Red River Colony before 1818, Great Plains, and Missouri River state\n* '''[[Ohio]]:''' Old Northwest (Historic [[Connecticut Western Reserve]]), Ohio River, and Great Lakes state.

In particular, the following areas exhibit a high degree of topographical variety: the eastern Midwest near the foothills of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]; the [[Great Lakes Basin]]; the heavily glaciated uplands of the [[North Shore (Lake Superior)|North Shore of Lake Superior]] in Minnesota, part of the ruggedly volcanic [[Canadian Shield]]; the [[Ozark Mountains]] of southern Missouri; and the deeply eroded [[Driftless Area]] of southwest Wisconsin, southeast Minnesota, northeast Iowa, and northwest Illinois.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nProceeding westward, the [[Appalachian Plateau]] topography gradually gives way to gently rolling hills and then (in central Ohio) to flat lands converted principally to farms and urban areas. This is the beginning of the vast Interior Plains of North America. As a result, [[prairie]]s cover most of the Great Plains states. Iowa and much of Illinois lie within an area called the ''prairie peninsula'', an eastward extension of prairies that borders [[conifer]] and mixed forests to the north, and [[hardwood]] [[deciduous]] forests to the east and south.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nGeographers subdivide the Interior Plains into the Interior Lowlands and the Great Plains on the basis of elevation. The Lowlands are mostly below {{convert|1,500|ft|m}} above sea level whereas the Great Plains to the west are higher, rising in [[Colorado]] to around {{convert|5,000|ft|m}}.\nThe Lowlands, then, are confined to parts of Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, [[Tennessee]], and [[Kentucky]]. Missouri and [[Arkansas]] have regions of Lowlands elevations, contrasting with their Ozark region (within the Interior Highlands). Eastern Ohio's hills are an extension of the Appalachian Plateau.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe Interior Plains are largely coincident with the vast [[Mississippi River]] Drainage System (other major components are the [[Missouri River|Missouri]] and Ohio Rivers). These rivers have for tens of millions of years been eroding downward into the mostly horizontal sedimentary rocks of [[Paleozoic]], [[Mesozoic]], and [[Cenozoic]] ages. The modern Mississippi River system has developed during the Pleistocene Epoch of the Cenozoic.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nRainfall decreases from east to west, resulting in different types of prairies, with the [[tallgrass prairie]] in the wetter eastern region, mixed-grass prairie in the central [[Great Plains]], and [[shortgrass prairie]] towards the [[rain shadow]] of the Rockies. Today, these three prairie types largely correspond to the [[Maize|corn]]/[[soybean]] area, the [[wheat]] belt, and the western rangelands, respectively.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nMuch of the [[coniferous forests]] of the Upper Midwest were clear-cut in the late 19th century, and mixed hardwood forests have become a major component of the new woodlands since then.

They brought with them a well-developed agricultural complex based on three major crops\u2014[[maize]], [[beans]], and [[squash (plant)|squash]]. Maize, or corn, was the primary crop of Mississippian farmers. They gathered a wide variety of seeds, nuts, and berries, and fished and hunted for fowl to supplement their diets. With such an intensive form of [[agriculture]], this culture supported large populations.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe Mississippi period was characterized by a [[mound builder (people)|mound-building]] culture.

They made canoes for fishing. Most of them lived in oval or conical [[wigwam]]s that could be easily moved away. Various tribes had different ways of living. The Ojibwas were primarily hunters and fishing was also important in the Ojibwas economy. Other tribes such as Sac, Fox, and Miami, both hunted and farmed.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThey were oriented toward the open prairies where they engaged in communal hunts for [[American Bison|buffalo (bison)]]. In the northern forests, the Ottawas and Potawatomis separated into small family groups for hunting. The Winnebagos and Menominees used both hunting methods interchangeably and built up widespread trade networks extending as far west as the Rockies, north to the Great Lakes, south to the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and east to the [[Atlantic Ocean]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe Hurons reckoned descent through the female line, while the others favored the patrilineal method. All tribes were governed under chiefdoms or complex chiefdoms. For example, Hurons were divided into matrilineal clans, each represented by a chief in the town council, where they met with a town chief on civic matters. But Chippewa people's social and political life was simpler than that of settled tribes.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe religious beliefs varied among tribes. Hurons believed in ''Yoscaha'', a supernatural being who lived in the sky and was believed to have created the world and the Huron people. At death, Hurons thought the soul left the body to live in a village in the sky. Chippewas were a deeply religious people who believed in the Great Spirit. They worshiped the Great Spirit through all their seasonal activities, and viewed religion as a private matter: Each person's relation with his personal guardian spirit was part of his thinking every day of life. Ottawa and Potawatomi people had very similar religious beliefs to those of the Chippewas.<ref name=Midwestlit />\n\nIn the Ohio River Valley, the dominant food supply was not hunting but agriculture.

The first group were fully nomadic, following the vast herds of [[American bison|buffalo]]. Some tribes occasionally engaged in agriculture, growing tobacco and corn primarily.

Some tribes are described as part of the 'Buffalo Culture' (sometimes called, for the [[American Bison]]). Although the Plains Indians hunted other animals, such as [[elk]] or [[Pronghorn|antelope]], bison was their primary game food source. Bison flesh, hide, and bones from [[Bison hunting]] provided the chief source of raw materials for items that Plains Indians made, including food, cups, decorations, crafting tools, knives, and clothing.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe tribes followed the bison's seasonal grazing and migration. The Plains Indians lived in [[teepees]] because they were easily disassembled and allowed the nomadic life of following game. When [[Spain|Spanish]] [[horse]]s were obtained, the Plains tribes rapidly integrated them into their daily lives. By the early 18th century, many tribes had fully adopted a [[horse culture]]. Before their adoption of guns, the Plains Indians hunted with [[spear]]s, [[bow (weapon)|bows]], and [[bows and arrows]], and various forms of [[Club (organization)|clubs]].

Most of them started as farmers, but later the larger proportion moved to towns and cities as entrepreneurs, businessmen, and urban professionals. Since its beginnings in the 1830s, Chicago has grown to dominate the Midwestern metropolis landscape for over a century.<ref>\"Yankees\" in Reiff, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Chicago''</ref>\n\nHistorian John Bunker has examined the worldview of the Yankee settlers in the Midwest:\n\n<blockquote>Because they arrived first and had a strong sense of community and mission, Yankees were able to transplant New England institutions, values, and mores, altered only by the conditions of frontier life. They established a public culture that emphasized the work ethic, the sanctity of private property, individual responsibility, faith in residential and social mobility, practicality, piety, public order and decorum, reverence for public education, activists, honest, and frugal government, town meeting democracy, and he believed that there was a public interest that transcends particular and stick ambitions. Regarding themselves as the elect and just in a world rife with sin, air, and corruption, they felt a strong moral obligation to define and enforce standards of community and personal behavior....This pietistic worldview was substantially shared by British, Scandinavian, Swiss, English-Canadian and Dutch Reformed immigrants, as well as by German Protestants and many of the Forty-Eighters.<ref>John Buenker, \"Wisconsin\" in {{cite book|last=James H. Madison, ed. |title=Heartland: Comparative Histories of the Midwestern States |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TMUCo0UXCjoC&pg=PA72|year=1988|publisher=Indiana University Press|pages=72\u201373|isbn=978-0253314239}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMidwestern politics pitted Yankees against the German Catholics and Lutherans, who were often led by the Irish Catholics. These large groups, Buenker argues:\n\n<blockquote>Generally subscribed to the work ethic, a strong sense of community, and activist government, but were less committed to economic individualism and privatism and ferociously opposed to government supervision of the personal habits. Southern and eastern European immigrants generally leaned more toward the Germanic view of things, while modernization, industrialization, and urbanization modified nearly everyone's sense of individual economic responsibility and put a premium on organization, political involvement, and education.<ref>John Buenker, \"Wisconsin\"</ref><ref>Richard J. Jensen, ''Illinois: a Bicentennial history'' (1977) ch 1-3</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Development of transportation ===\n==== Waterways ====\n[[File:LightningVolt Lake Michigan Sunset.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lake Michigan]] is shared by four Midwestern states: Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin.]]\nThree waterways have been important to the development of the Midwest. The first and foremost was the [[Ohio River]], which flowed into the [[Mississippi River]]. Development of the region was halted until 1795 by [[Spain]]'s control of the southern part of the Mississippi and its refusal to allow the shipment of American crops down the river and into the [[Atlantic Ocean]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe second waterway is the network of routes within the Great Lakes. The opening of the [[Erie Canal]] in 1825 completed an all-water shipping route, more direct than the Mississippi, to [[New York (state)|New York]] and the seaport of [[New York City]]. In 1848, The [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]] breached the [[continental divide]] spanning the [[Chicago Portage]] and linking the waters of the Great Lakes with those of the [[Mississippi Valley]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Lakeport and river cities grew up to handle these new shipping routes. During the [[Industrial Revolution]], the lakes became a conduit for [[iron ore]] from the [[Mesabi Range]] of Minnesota to [[steel mill]]s in the [[Mid-Atlantic States]]. The [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]], completed in 1959, opened the Midwest to the Atlantic Ocean.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/places/united-states-and-canada/canadian-physical-geography/saint-lawrence-seaway|title=Saint Lawrence Seaway|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe third waterway, the [[Missouri River]], extended water travel from the Mississippi almost to the Rocky Mountains.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n[[File:Efmo View from Fire Point.jpg|thumb|The [[Upper Mississippi River]] near [[Harpers Ferry, Iowa]]]]\nIn the 1870s and 1880s, the Mississippi River inspired two classic books\u2014''[[Life on the Mississippi]]'' and ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]''\u2014written by native Missourian Samuel Clemens, who used the pseudonym [[Mark Twain]]. His stories became staples of Midwestern lore. Twain's hometown of [[Hannibal, Missouri]], is a tourist attraction offering a glimpse into the Midwest of his time.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nInland canals in Ohio and Indiana constituted another important waterway, which connected with Great Lakes and Ohio River traffic. The commodities that the Midwest funneled into the [[Erie Canal]] down the Ohio River contributed to the wealth of New York City, which overtook [[Boston]] and [[Philadelphia]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==== Railroads and the automobile ====\nDuring the mid-19th century, the region got its first railroads, and the railroad junction in Chicago became the world's largest. During the century, Chicago became the nation's railroad center. By 1910, over 20 railroads operated passenger service out of six different downtown terminals. Even today, a century after [[Henry Ford]], six [[Class I railroad]]s meet in Chicago.{{sfnp|Condit|1973|pp=43-49, 58, 318-319}}<ref>{{Holland-Classic|pages = 66\u201391}}</ref>\n\nIn the period from 1890 to 1930, many Midwestern cities were connected by electric [[interurban]] railroads, similar to streetcars. The Midwest had more interurbans than any other region. In 1916, Ohio led all states with {{convert|2,798|mi|km}}, Indiana followed with {{convert|1,825|mi|km}}. These two states alone had almost a third of the country's interurban trackage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/railways-interurban |title=US History Encyclopedia: Interurban Railways |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=October 3, 2010}}</ref> The nation's largest interurban junction was in Indianapolis.

By 1900, [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] was the world center of the auto industry, and soon practically every city within 200 miles was producing auto parts that fed into its giant factories.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 3144703|title = The Automotive Industry: A Study in Industrial Location|journal = Land Economics|volume = 35|issue = 1|pages = 1\u201314|last1 = Hurley|first1 = Neil P.|year = 1959|doi = 10.2307/3144703}}</ref>\n\nIn 1903, Henry Ford founded the [[Ford Motor Company]]. Ford's manufacturing\u2014and those of automotive pioneers [[William C. Durant]], the [[Dodge]] brothers, [[Packard]], and [[Walter Chrysler]]\u2014established Detroit's status in the early 20th century as the world's automotive capital. The proliferation of businesses created a synergy that also encouraged truck manufacturers such as Rapid and [[GMC (automobile)|Grabowsky]].<ref name=Woodford>Woodford, Arthur M. (2001). ''This is Detroit: 1701\u20132001''. Wayne State University Press</ref>\n\nThe growth of the auto industry was reflected by changes in businesses throughout the Midwest and nation, with the development of garages to service vehicles and gas stations, as well as factories for parts and tires. Today, greater Detroit remains home to [[General Motors]], [[Chrysler]], and the Ford Motor Company.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gm.com/our-company/about-gm.html|title=About GM {{!}} General Motors|website=www.gm.com|access-date=2019-02-23}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n=== American Civil War ===\n{{Main|American Civil War}}\n\n==== Slavery prohibition and the Underground Railroad ====\n[[File:undergroundrailroadsmall2.jpg|upright=1.6|thumb|A map of various [[Underground Railroad]] routes]]\nThe Northwest Ordinance region, comprising the heart of the Midwest, was the first large region of the United States that prohibited [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] (the [[Northeastern United States]] [[Abolitionism in the United States|emancipated]] slaves in the 1830s). The regional southern boundary was the Ohio River, the border of freedom and slavery in American history and literature (see ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] and ''[[Beloved (novel)|Beloved]]'' by [[Toni Morrison]]).\n\nThe Midwest, particularly Ohio, provided the primary routes for the ''[[Underground Railroad]]'', whereby Midwesterners assisted slaves to freedom from their crossing of the Ohio River through their departure on [[Lake Erie]] to Canada. Created in the early 19th century, the Underground Railroad was at its height between 1850 and 1860. One estimate suggests that by 1850, 100,000 slaves had escaped via the Underground Railroad.<ref name=\"afroamhistory\">[http://afroamhistory.about.com/od/undergroundrailroad/a/undergroundrr.htm The Fugitive Slave Law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125175114/http://afroamhistory.about.com/od/undergroundrailroad/a/undergroundrr.htm |date=25 January 2009 }} African-American History, pp. 1\u20132. About.com</ref>\n\nThe Underground Railroad consisted of meeting points, secret routes, transportation, and safe houses and assistance provided by abolitionist sympathizers. Individuals were often organized in small, independent groups; this helped to maintain secrecy because individuals knew some connecting \"stations\" along the route, but knew few details of their immediate area. Escaped slaves would move north along the route from one way station to the next. Although the fugitives sometimes traveled on boat or train, they usually traveled on foot or by wagon.<ref>Bordewich, Fergus, 2005, p. 236</ref>\n\nThe region was shaped by the relative absence of slavery (except for Missouri), pioneer settlement, education in [[one-room school|one-room free public schools]], democratic notions brought by [[American Revolutionary War]] veterans, [[Protestant]] faiths and experimentation, and agricultural wealth transported on the Ohio River [[riverboat]]s, [[flatboat]]s, [[Barge|canal boats]], and [[rail transport|railroads]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\n==== Bleeding Kansas ====\n{{Main|Bleeding Kansas}}\n\nThe first violent conflicts leading up to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] occurred between two neighboring Midwestern states, Kansas and Missouri, involving [[Abolitionism in the United States|anti-slavery]] [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-Staters]] and pro-slavery \"[[Border Ruffian]]\" elements, that took place in the [[Kansas Territory]] and the western frontier towns of Missouri roughly between 1854 and 1858. At the heart of the conflict was the question of whether Kansas would enter the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] as a free state or slave state. As such, [[Bleeding Kansas]] was a [[proxy war]] between [[Northern United States|Northerners]] and [[Southern United States|Southerners]] over the issue of [[slavery in the United States|slavery]]. The term \"Bleeding Kansas\" was coined by [[Horace Greeley]] of the ''[[New York Tribune]]''; the events it encompasses directly presaged the Civil War.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n[[File:Bleeding Kansas Poster.jpg|thumb|upright|1855 [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-State]] poster]]\nSetting in motion the events later known as \"Bleeding Kansas\" was the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854|Kansas-Nebraska Act]]. The Act created the territories of Kansas and Nebraska, opened new lands that would help settlement in them, repealed the [[Missouri Compromise of 1820|Missouri Compromise]], and allowed settlers in those territories to determine through [[Popular sovereignty in the United States|popular sovereignty]] whether to allow slavery within their boundaries. It was hoped the Act would ease relations between the North and the South, because the South could expand slavery to new territories, but the North still had the right to abolish slavery in its states. Instead, opponents denounced the law as a concession to the [[The Slave Power|slave power]] of the South.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe new [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], born in the Midwest ([[Ripon, Wisconsin]], 1854) and created in opposition to the Act, aimed to stop the expansion of slavery, and soon emerged as the dominant force throughout the North.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masslive.com/history/index.ssf/2011/05/springfields_375th_from_puritans_to_presidents.html|title=Springfield's 375th: From Puritans to presidents|website=Masslive.com|access-date=2017-07-16}}</ref>\n\nAn ostensibly [[democracy|democratic]] idea, popular sovereignty stated that the inhabitants of each territory or state should decide whether it would be a free or slave state; however, this resulted in immigration ''en masse'' to Kansas by activists from both sides. At one point, Kansas had two separate governments, each with its own constitution, although only one was federally recognized. On January 29, 1861, Kansas was admitted to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] as a free state, less than three months before the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]] officially began the Civil War.<ref>Robert W. Johansson, ''Stephen A. Douglas '' (Oxford UP, 1973) pp&nbsp;374\u2013400</ref>\n\nThe calm in Kansas was shattered in May 1856 by two events that are often regarded as the opening shots of the Civil War. On May 21, the [[Free Soil Party|Free Soil]] town of [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], Kansas, was sacked by an armed pro\u2010slavery force from Missouri. A few days later, the [[Sacking of Lawrence]] led [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] and six of his followers to execute five men along the [[Pottawatomie massacre|Pottawatomie Creek]] in [[Franklin County, Kansas|Franklin County]], Kansas, in retaliation.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2952.html Africans in America Resource Bank: People and Events, 1853\u20131861, online]. Retrieved June 14, 2011.</ref>\n\nThe so-called \"Border War\" lasted for another four months, from May through October, between armed bands of pro\u2010slavery and Free Soil men. The [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] had two garrisons in Kansas, the First Cavalry Regiment at [[Fort Leavenworth]] and the [[2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment (United States)|Second Dragoons]] and Sixth Infantry at [[Fort Riley]].<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/pottawatomie-massacre-1 Gale Encyclopedia of U.S. History: Pottawatomie Massacre].

A fragile peace followed, but violent outbreaks continued intermittently for several more years.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nNational reaction to the events in Kansas demonstrated how deeply divided the country had become. The Border Ruffians were widely applauded in the South, even though their actions had cost the lives of numerous people. In the North, the murders committed by Brown and his followers were ignored by most, and lauded by a few.<ref>[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h84.html United States History \u2013 Bleeding Kansas online]. Retrieved June 14, 2011.</ref>\n\nThe civil conflict in Kansas was a product of the political fight over slavery. Federal troops were not used to decide a political question, but they were used by successive territorial governors to pacify the territory so that the political question of slavery in Kansas could finally be decided by peaceful, legal, and political means.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n[[File:US Slave Free 1789-1861.gif|thumb|upright=1.6|An animation depicting when United States territories and states forbade or allowed slavery, 1789\u20131861]]\nThe election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] in November 1860 was the final trigger for [[secession]] by the Southern states.<ref>David Potter, ''The Impending Crisis'', p. 485.</ref> Efforts at compromise, including the \"[[Corwin Amendment]]\" and the ''[[Crittenden Compromise]]'', failed.

All of the Midwestern states but one, Missouri, banned slavery. Though most battles were fought in the South, skirmishes between Kansas and Missouri continued until culmination with the [[Lawrence Massacre]] on August 21, 1863. Also known as Quantrill's Raid, the massacre was a rebel guerrilla attack by [[Quantrill's Raiders]], led by William Clarke Quantrill, on pro-Union Lawrence, Kansas. Quantrill's band of 448 Missouri guerrillas raided and plundered Lawrence, killing more than 150 and burning all the business buildings and most of the dwellings.

Western railroads, with large land grants available to attract farmers, set up agencies in [[Hamburg]] and other German cities, promising cheap transportation, and sales of farmland on easy terms.

In 1789, the [[Northwest Ordinance]] was enacted, creating the [[Northwest Territory]], which was bounded by the Great Lakes and the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. Because the Northwest Territory lay between the East Coast and the then-far-West, the states carved out of it were called the ''Northwest''. In the early 19th century, anything west of the Mississippi River was considered the West. The first recorded use of the term ''Midwestern'' to refer to a region of the central U.S. occurred in 1886, ''Midwest'' appeared in 1894, and ''Midwesterner'' in 1916.<ref name=\"oed.com\">[[Oxford English Dictionary]] entries for ''Midwestern'', ''Midwest'', and ''Midwesterner'', http://www.oed.com/</ref>\n\nSome maintain that only the areas that made up the Northwest Territory can truly be called the Midwest, and that all other areas to the west should be properly labeled as part of the \"Great Plains\" region instead. But following the settlement of the western prairie, others considered the row of states from North Dakota to Kansas to be part of the Midwest as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/ihas.200197407 |title=Regional Song Sampler: The Midwest &#124; Library of Congress |website=Loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-07-16}}</ref>\n\nThe states of the \"old Northwest\" are now called the \"East North Central States\" by the United States Census Bureau, with the \"Great Lakes region\" being also a popular term. The states just west of the Mississippi River and the Great Plains states are called the \"West North Central States\" by the Census Bureau.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Some entities in the Midwest are still referred to as \"Northwest\" for historical reasons (for example, [[Northwestern University]] in Illinois).{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n== Economy ==\n=== Farming and agriculture ===\n[[File:Pastoral-barn.jpg|thumb|A pastoral [[farm]] scene near [[Traverse City, Michigan]], with a classic American red [[barn]]]]\n[[File:maytag.jpg|thumb|right|Central Iowa cornfield in June]]\n[[File:Standing wheat in Kansas.jpg|thumb|Standing wheat in Kansas, part of America's Breadbasket]]\n[[File:Soybean fields at Applethorpe Farm.jpg|thumb|[[Soybean]] fields at [[Applethorpe Farm]], north of [[Hallsville, Ohio|Hallsville]] in Ross County, Ohio]]\n{{Further|Corn Belt|Wheat production in the United States}}\n[[Agriculture]] is one of the biggest drivers of local economies in the Midwest, accounting for billions of dollars worth of exports and thousands of jobs.

In cooler regions, wheat was often the crop of choice when lands were newly settled, leading to a \"wheat frontier\" that moved westward over the course of years. Also very common in the antebellum Midwest was farming corn while raising [[Hog (swine)|hogs]], complementing each other especially since it was difficult to get grain to market before the canals and railroads. After the \"wheat frontier\" had passed through an area, more diversified farms including [[dairy cattle|dairy]] and [[beef cattle]] generally took its place.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe very dense soil of the Midwest plagued the first settlers who were using wooden [[Plough|plows]], which were more suitable for loose forest soil. On the prairie, the plows bounced around and the soil stuck to them. This problem was solved in 1837 by an Illinois [[blacksmith]] named [[John Deere (inventor)|John Deere]] who developed a [[steel]] moldboard plow that was stronger and cut the roots, making the fertile soils of the prairie ready for farming.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe tallgrass prairie has been converted into one of the most intensive crop producing areas in [[North America]].

Also in the 1990s, the Midwest was at the center of the emerging [[Midwest emo]] movement, with bands like [[The Get Up Kids]] (Missouri), [[Cursive (band)|Cursive]] (Nebraska), and [[Cap'n Jazz]] (Illinois) blending earlier hard-core punk sounds with a more melodic indie rock sentiment. This hybrid of styles came to be known as Midwest emo. Chicago-based artists [[Fall Out Boy]] and [[Plain White T]]'s popularized the genre in the early part of the 21st century.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn the late 1990s, [[Eminem]] and [[Kid Rock]] emerged from the Detroit area. Eminem went on to become one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed rappers of all time. Meanwhile, Kid Rock successfully mixed elements of rap, hard rock, heavy metal, country rock, and pop in forming his own unique sound. Both artists are known for celebrating their Detroit roots.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n[[House Music]] and [[Techno]] both had their roots in Chicago and Detroit respectively in the mid-to-late 1980s. House music producers such as [[Frankie Knuckles]] and [[Marshall Jefferson]] recorded early house music records at Chicago's [[Trax Records]] while in Detroit, techno pioneers [[Juan Atkins]], [[Derrick May (musician)|Derrick May]], and [[Kevin Saunderson]] created a sound that, while ignored mostly in America, became quite popular in Europe.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/13/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-detroit-techno.html |title = Letter of Recommendation: Detroit Techno|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2017-07-13|last1 = Haider|first1 = Shuja}}</ref>\n\nNumerous [[classical music|classical]] [[composer]]s live and have lived in midwestern states, including [[Easley Blackwood, Jr.|Easley Blackwood]], [[Kenneth Gaburo]], [[Salvatore Martirano]], and [[Ralph Shapey]] (Illinois); [[Glenn Miller]] and [[Meredith Willson]] (Iowa); [[Leslie Bassett]], [[William Bolcom]], [[Michael Daugherty]], and [[David Gillingham]] (Michigan); [[Donald Erb]] (Ohio); [[Dominick Argento]] and [[Stephen Paulus]] (Minnesota).

In 1860\u20131920, both parties often selected either their president or vice president from the region.<ref>{{cite book |first=Lewis L. |last=Gould |title=Grand Old Party: A History of the Republicans |edition=2nd |year=2012 |page=126 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Little White Schoolhouse Ripon Wisconsin Feb 2012.jpg|thumb|The first local meeting of the new Republican Party took place here in [[Ripon, Wisconsin]] on March 20, 1854.]]\nOne of the two major political parties in the United States, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], originated in the Midwest in the 1850s; Ripon, Wisconsin had the first local meeting while [[Jackson, Michigan]] had the state county meeting of the new party. Its membership included many [[Yankee]]s who had settled the upper Midwest. The party opposed the expansion of slavery and stressed the Protestant ideals of thrift, a hard work ethic, self-reliance, democratic decision making, and religious tolerance.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gould |title=Grand Old Party: A History of the Republicans |edition=2nd |year=2012 |page=14 }}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1890s the wheat-growing regions were strongholds of the short-lived [[People's Party (United States)|Populist movement]] in the Plains states.<ref>{{cite book |first=Russel B. |last=Nye |title=Midwestern Progressive Politics |year=1968 }}</ref>\n\nStarting in the 1890s the middle class urban [[Progressive movement]] became influential in the region (as it was in other regions), with Wisconsin a major center. Under the [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|La Follettes]] Wisconsin fought against the GOP bosses and for efficiency, modernization, and the use of experts to solve social, economic, and political problems. Theodore Roosevelt's [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|1912 Progressive Party]] had the best showing in this region; carrying the states of Michigan, Minnesota, and South Dakota. In 1924, La Follette, Sr.'s [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924\u201334)|1924 Progressive Party]] did well in the region, but only carried his home base of Wisconsin.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe Midwest\u2014especially the areas west of Chicago\u2014has always been a stronghold of [[United States non-interventionism|isolationism]], a belief that America should not involve itself in foreign entanglements. This position was largely based on the many [[German American]] and [[Swedish-American]] communities. Isolationist leaders included the La Follettes, Ohio's [[Robert A. Taft]], and [[Robert R. McCormick|Colonel Robert McCormick]], publisher of the ''Chicago Tribune''.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Ralph H. |last=Smuckler |title=The Region of Isolationism |journal=[[American Political Science Review]] |year=1953 |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=386\u2013401 |jstor=1952029 |doi=10.2307/1952029 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=John N. |last=Schacht |title=Three Faces of Midwestern Isolationism: Gerald P.

Upper Midwestern states of Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin reliably voted Democratic in every presidential election from 1992 to 2012. The Great Plains states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas have voted for the Republican candidate in every presidential election since 1940, except for Democrat [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]]. Indiana is usually considered a Republican stronghold, voting that party's presidential candidate in every election since 1940, except for Johnson in 1964 and [[Barack Obama]] in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |title=Election Statistics, 1920 to Present |url=http://history.house.gov/Institution/Election-Statistics/Election-Statistics/ |website=History, Art & Archives: US House of Representatives |accessdate=30 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the 2016 elections, Republicans controlled the governors' office in all Midwestern states except Minnesota and the Republicans also controlled every partisan state legislature in the Midwest except [[Illinois state legislature|Illinois]]. The unicameral [[Nebraska Legislature]] is officially nonpartisan.<ref>{{cite web |title=Unicam Focus |url=https://nebraskalegislature.gov/education/lesson3.php |website=Nebraska Legislature |accessdate=30 July 2018}}</ref> In 2018, however, the Democrats made a significant comeback by flipping the gubernatorial elections in [[Illinois gubernatorial election, 2018|Illinois]], [[Kansas gubernatorial election, 2018|Kansas]], [[Michigan gubernatorial election, 2018|Michigan]] and [[Wisconsin gubernatorial election, 2018|Wisconsin]]. The Democrats also flipped the [[Minnesota House of Representatives]] after losing control in [[United States elections, 2014|2014]].\n\nThe state government of Illinois currently has a Democratic Governor [[J. B. Pritzker|J.B. Pritzker]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] super majorities in the state house and state senate. The state currently has two Democratic senators, and a 13\u20135 Democratic majority U.S. House of Representatives delegation.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nMany analysts{{who|date=May 2016}} consider Iowa the most evenly divided state in the country, but it has leaned Democratic for at least the past fifteen years.{{when|date=May 2016}} Iowa had a Democratic governor from 1999 until [[Terry Branstad]] was re-elected in the mid-term elections in 2010, and has had both one Democratic and one Republican senator since the early 1980s until the 2014 election when Republican [[Joni Ernst]] defeated Democrat [[Bruce Braley]] in a tightly contested race.<ref>{{cite web|title = Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|url = http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/|website = uselectionatlas.org|access-date = 2016-02-15|first = David|last = Leip}}</ref> As for Iowa's House delegation, Democrats currently hold a 3 to 1 seat majority as a result of the 2018 elections. Between 1992 and 2012, Iowa also voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in all elections except 2004, but in 2016 the state went to the Republicans by 10 percentage points. As a result of the 2016 elections, Republicans hold a majority in the [[Iowa House of Representatives]] and the [[Iowa Senate]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nMinnesota voters have not voted for a Republican candidate for president since 1972, longer than any other state. Minnesota was the only U.S. state (along with Washington, D.C.) to vote for its native son [[Walter Mondale]] over [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1984. However, the recent{{when|date=May 2016}} Democratic victories have often been fairly narrow, such as the 2016 Presidential Election. Minnesota also elected and re-elected a Republican governor ([[Tim Pawlenty]]), as well as supported some of the strongest [[Concealed carry in the United States|gun concealment]] laws in the nation.\n\nConsistently, Ohio is a battleground state in presidential elections. No Republican has won the office without winning Ohio. This trend has contributed to Ohio's reputation as a quintessential swing state. At the state level, however, Republicans are currently dominant. With the exception of one justice of the [[Supreme Court of Ohio]], all political offices open to statewide election are held by Republicans. Republicans have a majority in the [[Ohio House of Representatives]] and a supermajority in the [[Ohio Senate]]. At the federal level, Ohio currently has one Democratic and one Republican U.S. Senator.{{when|date=May 2016}} As a result of the 2012 elections, 12 of Ohio's 16 members of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] are Republicans.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe Great Plains states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas have been strongholds for the Republicans for many decades. These four states have gone for the Republican candidate in every presidential election since 1940, except for [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s landslide over [[Barry Goldwater]] in [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]]. Although North Dakota and South Dakota have often elected Democrats to Congress, after the 2012 election both states' congressional delegations are majority Republican. Nebraska has elected Democrats to the Senate and as governor in recent years, but both of its senators are Republican.{{when|date=May 2016}} Kansas has elected a majority of Democrats as governor since 1956, but has not elected a Democratic senator since 1932. Both of Kansas's U.S. Senators and all four of its U.S. House members are Republican.{{when|date=May 2016}}\n\nMissouri was historically considered a \"bellwether state\", having voted for the winner in every presidential election since 1904, with three exceptions: in [[1956 United States presidential election|1956]] for Democrat [[Adlai Stevenson II]]; in [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]] for Republican [[John McCain]]; and in [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]] for Republican [[Mitt Romney]]. Missouri's House delegation has generally been evenly divided, with the Democrats holding sway in the large cities at the opposite ends of the state, Kansas City and St. Louis (although the Kansas City suburbs are now trending Republican), and the Republicans controlling the rest of the state, save for a pocket of Democratic strength in [[Columbia, Missouri|Columbia]], home to the [[University of Missouri]]. However, as a result of the 2012 elections, Republicans now have a 6\u20132 majority in the state's House delegation, with African-American Democrats representing the major cities. Missouri's Senate seats were mostly controlled by Democrats until the latter part of the 20th century, but the Republicans have held one or both Senate seats continuously since 1976.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nAll Midwestern states use primary election to select delegates for both the Democratic and Republican national conventions, except for Iowa. The [[Iowa caucuses]] in early January of leap years are the first votes in the [[United States presidential election|presidential nominating process]] for both major parties, and attract enormous media attention.<ref>David P.

As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\nA '''Partimento'''  (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural ''partimenti'') is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from simple basso continuo [[accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}} Partimenti were central to the training of European court musicians from the late 1600s until the early 1800s. They had their greatest influence first in Italian conservatories, especially at the [[music conservatories of Naples]], and then later at the [[Paris Conservatory]], which emulated the Neapolitan conservatories.\"<ref name=partimentoinfluence>[http://partimenti.org/partimenti/about_parti/hist_overview.html The History of Partimenti]Monuments of Partimenti</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante, hailed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] as,\"the most celebrated harmonist of Italy, that is to say of the entire world.\"{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=70}}]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. \n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\nThe Paris Conservatory was greatly influenced by the [[music conservatories of Naples||music conservatories of Naples]]. As the Neapolitans did not have a class but called much of it \"Harmony.\" There was \"practical harmony\" improvised from partimenti played at the piano, and there was \"harmony\" as a written subject where a given bass or given soprano was \"realized\" by providing three additional voices. The resulting four-voice counterpoint on four staves (notated in soprano, alto, tenor, and bass clefs) was called a realization (''r\u00e9alisation''). A student would begin by playing elementary material as a ten- or eleven-year-old but would eventually develop the skill to write complicated four-voice counterpoint full of remote modulations and chromatic embellishments.{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2019|p=[http://partimenti.org/harmony/about_harmo/overview.html]}} [[Fran\u00e7ois Bazin (composer)|Fran\u00e7ois Bazin]] was a teacher of harmony at the Paris conservatory and many of his lessons were still titled \"partimenti\".{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2020|p=296}}\n\n=== Revival in the 21st century  ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Nurturing musical creativity beyond mere partimento realizations.  Influential monographs concerning partimento include [[Robert Gjerdingen|Robert O. Gjerdingen]]'s ''Music in the Galant Style'' (2007) and [[Giorgio Sanguinetti]]'s ''The Art of Partimento'' (2012). Partimenti gained increased recognition due to being part of [[Alma Deutscher]]'s early musical training, with her studies with Tobias Cramm and Robert Gjerdingen.{{efn|Her father, Israeli linguist Guy Deutscher, said, \u201cThe greatest moment was when we realized that she was playing her own melodies.\u201d He decided to take Alma\u2019s musical soul seriously, and began searching for methods of teaching classical music composition to children\u2014and for a teacher.He discovered a book, Music in the Galant Style, by Robert Gjerdingen, professor of music at North-western University\u2019s School of Music. Gjerdingen reveals the results of his exhaustive search through the libraries of Naples and other Italian cities to and the original sources, the pedagogical workbooks, known as partimenti (or singular, partimento, using the word to mean the method itself) of 18th-century music masters.}}{{sfn|Rasmussen|2017|p=25}}.\n\n== Partimento Rules ==\n\nSeveral Neapolitan teachers such as Fedele Fenaroli, Giovanni Furno and Giaocomo Insanguine published collections of ''regole'' (rules) and partimenti that were popular pedagogical materials across Europe. In particular, Fenaroli's ''Regole'' enjoyed a long publishing life, from the first edition 1775 to the final edition in 1930.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=78}}\n\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n== Consonances and Dissonances ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are '''perfect consonances''' because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered '''imperfect consonances''' because one can make distinctions between them.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=3}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <g b>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 3rd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d a'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 5th } } \\bar \"||\" <b g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 6th } }  \\bar \"||\"<g g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 8th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\nThere is a prohibition against two octaves or two fifths moving in parallel because, due to their perfection, they create no variation in harmony, and these [perfect intervals] are the fundamental basses that rule the key.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}}\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. They were invented to make the consonances sound more beautiful. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=14}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <fis, g>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 2nd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d g>^\\markup { \\center-column { 4th } } \\bar \"||\" <a g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 7th } }  \\bar \"||\"<fis g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 9th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n== Essential Foundations of the Key  ==\n\nThe ''Essential Foundations of the Key''{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}} or ''Rule of the Scale Steps''{{sfn|Furno|1817|p=2}} tell the student how to distribute chords over scale degrees, separate from the Rule of the Octave.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=117}}\n\nOne can give an 8ve to all the degrees of the key, as well as to their consonances, provided that one does not create parallel 8ves, seeing that two 5ths or 8ves, whether above or below, by step or by skip, the one after the other, are prohibited because they make bad harmony.\n\n\u2460 takes a 3rd, 5th.\n\n\u2461 takes a minor 3rd, 4th and major 6th. {{sfn|Furno|1817|p=3}}\n\n\u2462 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2462 is major. If, on the other hand, the said \u2462 is minor, then it takes the major 3rd and major 6th, and this comes about naturally.\n\n\u2463 takes a 3rd and 5th. Whenever the \u2463 ascends to the \u2464, it [\u2463] can take the 6th in addition to the 3rd and 5th. And if \u2463 descends from \u2464, then stay with the same consonances as for the said \u2464, which become in turn a 2nd, major [=augmented] 4th, and 6th.\n\n\u2464 takes a major 3rd and 5th. Give a minor seventh to a \u2464 that returns to the \u2460. This seventh cannot rise, but must resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n\u2465 takes a 3rd, and 6th. When \u2465 is major and descends to \u2464, then it is better to use a major 6th in the accompaniment, because it makes better harmony. And one can add to \u2465, as if it were \u2461, by giving it a 3rd, a 4th, and a major 6th. But if the \u2465 neither ascends to \u2466 or descends to \u2460, then give it a 3rd and 5th.\n\n\u2466 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2466 is major. If, on the other hand, the \u2466 is minor, then the 3rd and the 6th in the accompaniment should both be major, and this comes about naturally. Give a diminished fifth to a \u2466 rising to the \u2460, in addition to the 3rd and 6th. This diminished fifth cannot rise, but must also resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n== Cadences ==\nA cadence is when the bass goes from \u2460 to \u2464, and [then] from \u2464 to \u2460.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7a}} There are three types of cadences: Simple, Compound and Double.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7b}}\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464. That is, the \u2460 takes the 3rd and 5th, and the \u2464 takes the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n

As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\nA '''Partimento'''  (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural ''partimenti'') is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from simple basso continuo [[accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}} Partimenti were central to the training of European court musicians from the late 1600s until the early 1800s. They had their greatest influence first in Italian conservatories, especially at the [[music conservatories of Naples]], and then later at the [[Paris Conservatory]], which emulated the Neapolitan conservatories.\"<ref name=partimentoinfluence>[http://partimenti.org/partimenti/about_parti/hist_overview.html The History of Partimenti]Monuments of Partimenti</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante, hailed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] as,\"the most celebrated harmonist of Italy, that is to say of the entire world.\"{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=70}}]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. \n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\nThe Paris Conservatory was greatly influenced by the [[music conservatories of Naples||music conservatories of Naples]]. As the Neapolitans did not have a class but called much of it \"Harmony.\" There was \"practical harmony\" improvised from partimenti played at the piano, and there was \"harmony\" as a written subject where a given bass or given soprano was \"realized\" by providing three additional voices. The resulting four-voice counterpoint on four staves (notated in soprano, alto, tenor, and bass clefs) was called a realization (''r\u00e9alisation''). A student would begin by playing elementary material as a ten- or eleven-year-old but would eventually develop the skill to write complicated four-voice counterpoint full of remote modulations and chromatic embellishments.{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2019|p=[http://partimenti.org/harmony/about_harmo/overview.html]}} [[Fran\u00e7ois Bazin (composer)|Fran\u00e7ois Bazin]] was a teacher of harmony at the Paris conservatory and many of his lessons were still titled \"partimenti\".{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2020|p=296}}\n\n=== Revival in the 21st century  ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Nurturing musical creativity beyond mere partimento realizations.  Influential monographs concerning partimento include [[Robert Gjerdingen|Robert O. Gjerdingen]]'s ''Music in the Galant Style'' (2007) and [[Giorgio Sanguinetti]]'s ''The Art of Partimento'' (2012). Partimenti gained increased recognition due to being part of [[Alma Deutscher]]'s early musical training, with her studies with Tobias Cramm and [[Robert Gjerdingen]].{{efn|Her father, Israeli linguist Guy Deutscher, said, \u201cThe greatest moment was when we realized that she was playing her own melodies.\u201d He decided to take Alma\u2019s musical soul seriously, and began searching for methods of teaching classical music composition to children\u2014and for a teacher.He discovered a book, Music in the Galant Style, by Robert Gjerdingen, professor of music at North-western University\u2019s School of Music. Gjerdingen reveals the results of his exhaustive search through the libraries of Naples and other Italian cities to and the original sources, the pedagogical workbooks, known as partimenti (or singular, partimento, using the word to mean the method itself) of 18th-century music masters.}}{{sfn|Rasmussen|2017|p=25}}.\n\n== Partimento Rules ==\n\nSeveral Neapolitan teachers such as Fedele Fenaroli, Giovanni Furno and Giaocomo Insanguine published collections of ''regole'' (rules) and partimenti that were popular pedagogical materials across Europe. In particular, Fenaroli's ''Regole'' enjoyed a long publishing life, from the first edition 1775 to the final edition in 1930.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=78}}\n\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof.

Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n== Consonances and Dissonances ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are '''perfect consonances''' because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered '''imperfect consonances''' because one can make distinctions between them.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=3}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <g b>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 3rd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d a'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 5th } } \\bar \"||\" <b g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 6th } }  \\bar \"||\"<g g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 8th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\nThere is a prohibition against two octaves or two fifths moving in parallel because, due to their perfection, they create no variation in harmony, and these [perfect intervals] are the fundamental basses that rule the key.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}}\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. They were invented to make the consonances sound more beautiful. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=14}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <fis, g>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 2nd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d g>^\\markup { \\center-column { 4th } } \\bar \"||\" <a g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 7th } }  \\bar \"||\"<fis g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 9th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n== Essential Foundations of the Key  ==\n\nThe ''Essential Foundations of the Key''{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}} or ''Rule of the Scale Steps''{{sfn|Furno|1817|p=2}} tell the student how to distribute chords over scale degrees, separate from the Rule of the Octave.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=117}}\n\nOne can give an 8ve to all the degrees of the key, as well as to their consonances, provided that one does not create parallel 8ves, seeing that two 5ths or 8ves, whether above or below, by step or by skip, the one after the other, are prohibited because they make bad harmony.\n\n\u2460 takes a 3rd, 5th.\n\n\u2461 takes a minor 3rd, 4th and major 6th. {{sfn|Furno|1817|p=3}}\n\n\u2462 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2462 is major. If, on the other hand, the said \u2462 is minor, then it takes the major 3rd and major 6th, and this comes about naturally.\n\n\u2463 takes a 3rd and 5th. Whenever the \u2463 ascends to the \u2464, it [\u2463] can take the 6th in addition to the 3rd and 5th. And if \u2463 descends from \u2464, then stay with the same consonances as for the said \u2464, which become in turn a 2nd, major [=augmented] 4th, and 6th.\n\n\u2464 takes a major 3rd and 5th. Give a minor seventh to a \u2464 that returns to the \u2460. This seventh cannot rise, but must resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n\u2465 takes a 3rd, and 6th. When \u2465 is major and descends to \u2464, then it is better to use a major 6th in the accompaniment, because it makes better harmony. And one can add to \u2465, as if it were \u2461, by giving it a 3rd, a 4th, and a major 6th. But if the \u2465 neither ascends to \u2466 or descends to \u2460, then give it a 3rd and 5th.\n\n\u2466 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2466 is major. If, on the other hand, the \u2466 is minor, then the 3rd and the 6th in the accompaniment should both be major, and this comes about naturally. Give a diminished fifth to a \u2466 rising to the \u2460, in addition to the 3rd and 6th. This diminished fifth cannot rise, but must also resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n== Cadences ==\nA cadence is when the bass goes from \u2460 to \u2464, and [then] from \u2464 to \u2460.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7a}} There are three types of cadences: Simple, Compound and Double.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7b}}\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464.

He was commonly known as '''Auletes''' ({{lang-grc|\u0391\u1f50\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2}}, ''Aul\u0113t\u1e17s'' \"the Flautist\"), referring to the king's love of playing the [[flute]] in [[Dionysia]]n festivals. As a member of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]], he was a descendant of its founder, [[Ptolemy&nbsp;I]]. \n\nPtolemy XII was an [[illegitimate]] son of [[Ptolemy&nbsp;IX]] by an uncertain mother. In 116 BC Ptolemy IX's father, [[Ptolemy&nbsp;VIII]], died and he became co-regent with his mother, [[Cleopatra&nbsp;III]]. However, he was forced into a civil war against his mother and brother, [[Ptolemy&nbsp;X]], leading to his exile in 107 BC. Cleopatra&nbsp;III sent her grandsons to [[Kos]] in 103 BC. They were captured by [[Mithridates&nbsp;VI of Pontus]] probably in 88 BC, around the time Ptolemy&nbsp;IX returned to the Egyptian throne. After their father died in 81 BC, Ptolemy XII's half-sister [[Berenice&nbsp;III]] took the throne. She was soon murdered by her cousin and co-regent, [[Ptolemy&nbsp;XI]], who was then killed. \n\nPtolemy XII was recalled from [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]] and proclaimed king of Egypt, while his brother, also named [[Ptolemy of Cyprus|Ptolemy]], became king of [[Cyprus]]. By his wife [[Cleopatra&nbsp;V Tryphaena]], Ptolemy XII had at least one child, [[Berenice&nbsp;IV]], and probably [[Cleopatra&nbsp;VII]]; he had his three youngest children, [[Arsinoe&nbsp;IV]], [[Ptolemy&nbsp;XIII]], and [[Ptolemy&nbsp;XIV]], with an unknown mother. His uncle, Ptolemy&nbsp;X, had left Egypt to [[Rome]] in the event there were no surviving heirs, making Roman annexation of Egypt a possibility. In an effort to prevent this, Ptolemy&nbsp;XII established an alliance with Rome late into his first reign. Rome annexed Cyprus in 58 BC, causing Ptolemy of Cyprus to commit suicide. \n\nShortly afterwards, Ptolemy XII was deposed by the Egyptian people and fled to Rome; his eldest daughter, Berenice&nbsp;IV, took the throne. With funding and military assistance from the Roman Republic, Ptolemy&nbsp;XII was able to recapture Egypt and have Berenice&nbsp;IV killed in 55 BC. He named his daughter Cleopatra&nbsp;VII as his co-regent in 52 BC. He died the next year and was succeeded by Cleopatra and her brother, Ptolemy&nbsp;XIII, as joint rulers.\n\n==Background and early life==\n[[File:PtolemyIX-StatueHead MuseumOfFineArtsBoston.png|thumb|left|Bust of [[Ptolemy IX Soter]].]]\n[[File:Mithridates VI Louvre.jpg|thumb|Bust of [[Mithridates VI Eupator|Mithridates VI of Pontus]].]]\nPtolemy XII was the oldest son of [[Ptolemy IX Soter]]. The identity of his mother is uncertain. Ptolemy IX was married twice, to his sister [[Cleopatra IV]] from around 119 BC until he was forced to divorce her in 115 BC, and secondly to another sister [[Cleopatra Selene of Syria|Cleopatra Selene]] from 115 BC, until he abandoned her during his flight from Alexandria in 107 BC. However, [[Cicero]] and other ancient sources refer to Ptolemy XII as an [[legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] son; [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus|Pompeius Trogus]] called him a \"[[:wikt:nothus|nothos]]\" (bastard), while [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] wrote that Ptolemy IX had no legitimate sons at all.<ref>[[Cicero]] ''Agr.'' 2.42; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 1.9.3</ref>{{sfn|Sullivan|1990|p= 92}} Some scholars have therefore proposed that his mother was a concubine \u2013 probably an [[Hellenistic Greeks|Alexandrian Greek]],<ref name=\"DH\">Dodson, Aidan and Hilton, Dyan.

Lefkowitz notes, however, that if Cleopatra's paternal grandmother had been Egyptian, it would have been more likely Ptolemy XII was the first speaker of the Egyptian language, instead of his daughter Cleopatra.</ref> However, Chris Bennett argues that Ptolemy XII's mother was Cleopatra IV and that he was considered illegitimate simply because she had never been co-regent.{{sfn|Bennett|1997|p=46}} This theory is endorsed by the historian [[Adrian Goldsworthy]].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2011|pp=69\u201370}}\n\nThe date of Ptolemy XII's birth is thus uncertain.{{sfn|Stanwick|2010|p=60}} If he was the son of Cleopatra IV, he was probably born around 117 BC and followed around a year later by a brother, known as [[Ptolemy of Cyprus]]. In 117 BC, Ptolemy IX was governor of [[Cyprus]], but in 116 BC his father [[Ptolemy VIII]] died and he returned to Alexandria, becoming the junior co-regent of his grandmother [[Cleopatra II]] and his mother [[Cleopatra III]]. Cleopatra II died in 115 BC and shortly afterwards Cleopatra III forced Ptolemy IX to divorce his sister-wife Cleopatra IV, who was sent off to marry the [[Seleucid]] king [[Antiochus IX Cyzicenus]]. She was murdered by his rival in 114 BC. Ptolemy IX meanwhile had been remarried to Cleopatra Selene, with whom he had a daughter, [[Berenice III]].{{sfn|H\u00f6lbl|2001|p=206-207}} By 109 BC, Ptolemy IX had begun the process of introducing Ptolemy XII to public life. In that year, Ptolemy XII served as the Priest of Alexander and Ptolemaic kings (an office which Ptolemy IX otherwise held himself throughout his reign) and had a festival established in his honour in [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]].<ref>''[[Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum|SEG]]'' IX.5.</ref><ref name=CBP12>{{cite web |last1=Bennett |first1=Chris |title=Ptolemy IX|url=http://instonebrewer.com/TyndaleSites/Egypt/ptolemies/ptolemy_ix_fr.htm|website=Egyptian Royal Genealogy |accessdate=11 November 2019}}</ref> Relations between Ptolemy IX and his mother deteriorated.

They were held by Mithridates as hostages until 80 BC. At some point during this period, probably in 81 or 80 BC, they were engaged to two of Mithridates' daughters, Mithridatis and Nyssa.<ref>[[Appian]], ''Mithridatica'' 16.111</ref> Meanwhile, Ptolemy IX died in December 81 BC and was succeeded by Berenice III. In April 80 BC, [[Ptolemy XI Alexander II]], the son of Ptolemy X, was installed as her co-regent, promptly murdered her, and was himself killed by an angry Alexandrian mob. The Alexandrians then summoned Ptolemy XII to return to Egypt and assume the kingship; his brother became king of Cyprus, where he would reign until 58 BC.{{sfn|H\u00f6lbl|2001|p=222}}{{sfn|Bradford|2000|p=33}}{{sfn|Roller|2010|p=17}}\n\n==First reign (80\u201358 BC)==\n[[File:Flickr - archer10 (Dennis) - Egypt-14A-024.jpg|thumb|Egyptian-style statue of Ptolemy XII found at the Temple of the Crocodile in [[Fayoum]], Egypt.]]\n\nOn his arrival in Alexandria, in April 80 BC, Ptolemy XII was proclaimed king. His reign was officially dated as having begun on the death of his father in 81 BC, thereby eliding the reigns of Berenice III and Ptolemy X. Shortly after his accession, Ptolemy married [[Cleopatra V of Egypt|Cleopatra Tryphaena]].{{sfn|H\u00f6lbl|2001|pp=222-223}} Her parentage is uncertain - modern scholarship often interprets her as a sister,{{sfn|H\u00f6lbl|2001|pp=222-223}} but Christopher Bennett argues that she was a daughter of Ptolemy X.{{sfn|Bennett|1997|p=39}} The couple became co-regents and were encorporated into the Ptolemaic dynastic cult together as the ''Theoi Philopatores kai Philadelphoi'' (Father-loving and Sibling-loving Gods). This title was probably meant to reinforce Ptolemy XII's claim to the throne in the face of claims that his parentage meant that he was an illegitimate son of Ptolemy IX and therefore not entitled to rule.{{sfn|H\u00f6lbl|2001|pp=222-223}} \n\nIn 76 BC, the [[High Priest of Ptah]] in [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] died and Ptolemy XII travelled to Memphis to appoint his fourteen-year-old son, [[Pasherienptah III]], as the new High Priest. In turn, Pasherienptah III crowned Ptolemy as [[Pharaoh]] and then went to Alexandria, where he was appointed as Ptolemy XII's 'prophet'. These encounters are described in detail on Pasherienptah's funerary stela, ''Stele BM 866'', and they demonstrate the extremely close and mutually reinforcing relationship that had developed between the Ptolemaic kings and the Memphite priesthood by this date.{{sfn|H\u00f6lbl|2001|pp=222-223}}\n\nIn August 69 BC, Cleopatra V ceases to be mentioned as co-regent. The images of her that had been carved on the main [[Pylon (architecture)|pylon]] of the [[Temple of Edfu|Temple of Horus]] at [[Edfu]] were covered over at this time. The reason for this sudden shift is unknown, but presumably she was divorced at this time.{{sfn|H\u00f6lbl|2001|pp=222-223}} Ptolemy adopted a new royal epithet ''Neos Dionysos'' (New Dionysus) at some time after this; Chris Bennett proposes that the epithet was linked to the break with Cleopatra.<ref name=CBP12/>\n\n===Relations with Rome===\n[[File:Pompey the Great.jpg|thumb|[[Pompey]], Ptolemy XII's key ally in Rome.]]\n[[File:Ptolemy XII Auletes - 185.jpg|thumb|Relief of Ptolemy XII from the [[Temple of Kom Ombo|double temple at Kom Ombo]].]]\n[[File:Edfu Temple 9609.JPG|thumb|First [[pylon (architecture)|pylon]] at [[Edfu]] [[Temple of Edfu|Temple]], which Ptolemy XII decorated with figures of himself smiting the enemy.]]\nWhen Ptolemy X had died in 88 BC, his will had left Egypt to Rome in the event that he had no surviving heirs. Although the Romans had not acted on this, the possibility that they might forced the following Ptolemies to adopt a careful and respectful policy towards Rome.{{sfn|H\u00f6lbl|2001|pp=223-224}}{{sfn|Siani-Davies|1997|p=307}} Ptolemy XII continued this pro-Roman policy in order to protect himself and secure his dynasty's fate. However, Egypt came under increasing Roman pressure nevertheless. In 65 BC, the [[Roman censor]], [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] proposed that the Romans annex of Egypt.<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Crassus'' 13.2</ref> This proposal failed in the face of opposition from [[Quintus Lutatius Catulus]] and [[Cicero]]. In light of this crisis, however, Ptolemy XII began to expend significant resources on bribing Roman politicians to support his interests. In 63 BC, when [[Pompey]] was reorganising Syria and Anatolia following his victory in the [[Third Mithridatic War]], Ptolemy sought to form a relationship with Pompey by sending him a golden crown. Ptolemy also provided pay and maintenance for 8,000 cavalry to Pompey for his war with [[Judaea]]. He also asked Pompey to come to Alexandria and help to put down a revolt which had apparently broken out in Egypt; Pompey refused.<ref>[[Appian]], ''Mithridatica'' 114; [[Josephus]], ''Antiquities of the Jews'' 14.35</ref>{{sfn|H\u00f6lbl|2001|pp=223-224}}{{sfn|Bradford|2000|p=35}}\n\nThe money required for these bribes was enormous. Initially, Ptolemy XII funded them by raising taxes. A strike by farmers of royal land in [[Herakleopolis]] which is attested in a papyrus document from 61/60 BC has been interpreted as a sign of widespread discontent with this taxation. Increasingly, Ptolemy XII also had recourse to loans from Roman bankers, such as [[Gaius Rabirius Postumus]]. This gave the Romans even more leverage over his regime and meant that the fate of Egypt became an increasingly immediate issue in Roman politics.{{sfn|H\u00f6lbl|2001|pp=223-224}} \n\nFinally, in 60 BC, Ptolemy XII travelled to Rome, where the [[First Triumvirate]], composed of Pompey, Crassus, and [[Julius Caesar]], had just taken power, in order to negotiate official recognition of his kingship. Ptolemy paid Pompey and Caesar six thousand [[Talent (measurement)|talents]] - an enormous sum, equivalent to the total annual revenue of Egypt.<ref>[[Suetonius]] ''Life of Julius Caesar'' 54.3</ref> In return, a formal alliance or ''foedus'' was formed. The [[Roman Senate]] recognised Ptolemy as king and Caesar passed a law that added Ptolemy to the list of friends and allies of the people of Rome (''amici et socii populi Romani'') in 59 BC.<ref>[[Caesar]] ''[[Commentarii de Bello Civili|Bellum Civile]]'' 3.107; [[Cicero]], ''Pro Rabirio Postumo'' 3; Cicero, ''Letter to Atticus'' 2.16.2</ref>{{sfn|Siani-Davies|1997|p=316}}{{sfn|H\u00f6lbl|2001|pp=225-226}} \n \nIn 58 BC, the Romans [[Roman Cyprus|took control of Cyprus]], causing its ruler, Ptolemy XII's brother, to commit suicide.{{sfn|Roller|2010|p=22}} Ptolemy XII took no action in response to his brother's death and Cyprus remained a Roman province until returned to Ptolemaic control by Julius Caesar in 48 BC.{{sfn|H\u00f6lbl|2001|pp=226-227}}\n\n==Exile in Rome (58-55 BC)==\n{{further|Early life of Cleopatra}}\nThe bribery policy had been unpopular in Egypt for a long time, both because of its obsequiousness and because of the heavy tax burden that it entailed, but the annexation of Cyprus demonstrated its failure and enraged the people of Alexandria. The courtiers in Alexandria forced Ptolemy to step down from the thone and leave Egypt.<ref>[[Cassius Dio]] 39.12; [[Plutarch]], ''Life of Pompey'' 49.7.</ref> He was replaced by his daughter Berenice IV, who ruled jointly with Cleopatra Tryphaena, who is probably Ptolemy XII's former wife but may be an otherwise unattested daughter. Following Cleopatra Tryphaena's death a year later, Berenice ruled alone from 57 to 56 BC.{{sfn|Siani-Davies|1997|p=324}}{{sfn|H\u00f6lbl|2001|pp=226-227}}\n\n[[File:Denier \u00e0 l'effigie de Pomp\u00e9e.jpg|thumb|left|A [[denarius]] of Pompey minted 49-48 BC]]\nTaking his daughter Cleopatra with him, Ptolemy fled for the safety of Rome.{{sfn|Bradford|2000|p=37}} On the way, he stopped in [[Rhodes]] where the exiled [[Cato the Younger]] offered him advice on how to approach the Roman aristocracy, but no tangible support. In Rome, Ptolemy XII prosecuted his restitution but met opposition from certain members of the Senate. His old ally Pompey housed the exiled king and his daughter and argued on behalf of Ptolemy's restoration in the Senate.<ref>[[Strabo]] ''Geography'' 17.1.11; [[Cassius Dio]] 39.14.3</ref>{{sfn|H\u00f6lbl|2001|pp=226-227}} During this time, Roman creditors realized that they would not get the return on their loans to the king without his restoration.{{sfn|Siani-Davies|1997|p=323}} In 57 BC, pressure from the Roman public forced the Senate's decision to restore Ptolemy. However, Rome did not wish to invade Egypt to restore the king, since the [[Sibylline books]] stated that if an Egyptian king asked for help and Rome proceeded with military intervention, great dangers and difficulties would occur.{{sfn|Bradford|2000|pp=39\u201340}}\n\nEgyptians heard rumours of Rome's possible intervention and disliked the idea of their exiled king's return. The Roman historian [[Cassius Dio]] wrote that a group of one hundred men were sent as envoys from Egypt to make their case to the Romans against Ptolemy XII's restoration. Ptolemy seemingly had their leader [[Dio of Alexandria]] poisoned and most of the other protesters killed before they reached Rome.{{sfn|Siani-Davies|1997|p=325}}\n\n==Restoration and Second Reign (55\u201351 BC)==\n{{further|Early life of Cleopatra|Reign of Cleopatra}}\n[[File:Ptolemy xii.png|thumb|120px|Rare [[drachma]] of Ptolemy XII minted at [[Paphos]], [[History of Cyprus|Cyprus]] in 53 BC,{{sfn|Svoronos|1904|loc=vol.

Gabinius defeated the Egyptian frontier forces, marched to Alexandria, and attacked the palace, where the palace guards surrendered without fighting.{{sfn|Bradford|2000|p=43}} The exact date of Ptolemy XII's restoration is unknown; the earliest possible date of restoration was 4 January 55 BC and the latest possible date was 24 June the same year. Upon regaining power, Ptolemy acted against Berenice, and along with her supporters, she was executed. Ptolemy XII maintained his grip on power in Alexandria with the assistance of around two thousand Roman soldiers and mercenaries, known as the [[Gabiniani]]. This arrangement enabled Rome to exert power over Ptolemy, who ruled until he fell ill in 51 BC.{{sfn|Siani-Davies|1997|p=338}} On 31 May 52 BC his daughter Cleopatra VII was named as his coregent.{{sfn|Roller|2010|p=27}}\n\nAt the moment of Ptolemy XII's restoration, Roman creditors demanded the repayment of their loans, but the Alexandrian treasury could not repay the king's debt. Learning from previous mistakes, Ptolemy XII shifted popular resentment of tax increases from himself to a Roman, his main creditor [[Gaius Rabirius Postumus]], whom he appointed ''[[dioiketes]]'' (minister of finance), and so in charge of debt repayment. Perhaps Gabinius had also put pressure on Ptolemy XII to appoint Rabirius, who now had direct access to the financial resources of Egypt but exploited the land too much. The king had to imprison Rabirius to protect his life from the angry people, then allowed him to escape. Rabirius immediately left Egypt and went back to Rome at the end of 54 BC. There he was accused ''de repetundis'', but defended by [[Cicero]] and probably acquitted.<ref>Cicero.</ref>{{sfn|Hu\u00df|2001|pp=696\u2013697}} Ptolemy also permitted a debasing of the coinage as an attempt to repay the loans. Near the end of Ptolemy's reign, the value of Egyptian coinage dropped to about fifty per cent of its value at the beginning of his first reign.{{sfn|Siani-Davies|1997|pp=332\u2013334}}\n\nPtolemy XII died sometime before 22 March 51 BC.{{sfn|Roller|2010|pp=53, 56}} His will stipulated that Cleopatra VII and her brother Ptolemy XIII should rule Egypt together.

\"Ptolemy New [[Dionysus]], Father-lover, Sibling-lover\"; {{c.|117 BC}} \u2013 before 22 March 51 BC) was a king of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] of [[Ancient Egypt]]. He was commonly known as '''Auletes''' ({{lang-grc|\u0391\u1f50\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2}}, ''Aul\u0113t\u1e17s'' \"the Flautist\"), referring to the king's love of playing the [[flute]] in [[Dionysia]]n festivals. As a member of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]], he was a descendant of its founder, [[Ptolemy&nbsp;I]]. \n\nPtolemy XII was an [[illegitimate]] son of [[Ptolemy&nbsp;IX]] by an uncertain mother. In 116 BC Ptolemy IX's father, [[Ptolemy&nbsp;VIII]], died and he became co-regent with his mother, [[Cleopatra&nbsp;III]]. However, he was forced into a civil war against his mother and brother, [[Ptolemy&nbsp;X]], leading to his exile in 107 BC. Cleopatra&nbsp;III sent her grandsons to [[Kos]] in 103 BC. They were captured by [[Mithridates&nbsp;VI of Pontus]] probably in 88 BC, around the time Ptolemy&nbsp;IX returned to the Egyptian throne. After their father died in 81 BC, Ptolemy XII's half-sister [[Berenice&nbsp;III]] took the throne. She was soon murdered by her cousin and co-regent, [[Ptolemy&nbsp;XI]], who was then killed. \n\nPtolemy XII was recalled from [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]] and proclaimed king of Egypt, while his brother, also named [[Ptolemy of Cyprus|Ptolemy]], became king of [[Cyprus]]. By his wife [[Cleopatra&nbsp;V Tryphaena]], Ptolemy XII had at least one child, [[Berenice&nbsp;IV]], and probably [[Cleopatra&nbsp;VII]]; he had his three youngest children, [[Arsinoe&nbsp;IV]], [[Ptolemy&nbsp;XIII]], and [[Ptolemy&nbsp;XIV]], with an unknown mother. His uncle, Ptolemy&nbsp;X, had left Egypt to [[Rome]] in the event there were no surviving heirs, making Roman annexation of Egypt a possibility. In an effort to prevent this, Ptolemy&nbsp;XII established an alliance with Rome late into his first reign. Rome annexed Cyprus in 58 BC, causing Ptolemy of Cyprus to commit suicide. \n\nShortly afterwards, Ptolemy XII was deposed by the Egyptian people and fled to Rome; his eldest daughter, Berenice&nbsp;IV, took the throne. With funding and military assistance from the Roman Republic, Ptolemy&nbsp;XII was able to recapture Egypt and have Berenice&nbsp;IV killed in 55 BC. He named his daughter Cleopatra&nbsp;VII as his co-regent in 52 BC. He died the next year and was succeeded by Cleopatra and her brother, Ptolemy&nbsp;XIII, as joint rulers.\n\n==Background and early life==\n[[File:PtolemyIX-StatueHead MuseumOfFineArtsBoston.png|thumb|left|Bust of [[Ptolemy IX Soter]].]]\n[[File:Mithridates VI Louvre.jpg|thumb|Bust of [[Mithridates VI Eupator|Mithridates VI of Pontus]].]]\nPtolemy XII was the oldest son of [[Ptolemy IX Soter]]. The identity of his mother is uncertain. Ptolemy IX was married twice, to his sister [[Cleopatra IV]] from around 119 BC until he was forced to divorce her in 115 BC, and secondly to another sister [[Cleopatra Selene of Syria|Cleopatra Selene]] from 115 BC, until he abandoned her during his flight from Alexandria in 107 BC. However, [[Cicero]] and other ancient sources refer to Ptolemy XII as an [[legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] son; [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus|Pompeius Trogus]] called him a \"[[:wikt:nothus|nothos]]\" (bastard), while [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] wrote that Ptolemy IX had no legitimate sons at all.<ref>[[Cicero]] ''Agr.'' 2.42; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 1.9.3</ref>{{sfn|Sullivan|1990|p= 92}} Some scholars have therefore proposed that his mother was a concubine \u2013 probably an [[Hellenistic Greeks|Alexandrian Greek]],<ref name=\"DH\">Dodson, Aidan and Hilton, Dyan.

Lefkowitz notes, however, that if Cleopatra's paternal grandmother had been Egyptian, it would have been more likely Ptolemy XII was the first speaker of the Egyptian language, instead of his daughter Cleopatra.</ref> However, Chris Bennett argues that Ptolemy XII's mother was Cleopatra IV and that he was considered illegitimate simply because she had never been co-regent.{{sfn|Bennett|1997|p=46}} This theory is endorsed by the historian [[Adrian Goldsworthy]].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2011|pp=69\u201370}}\n\nThe date of Ptolemy XII's birth is thus uncertain.{{sfn|Stanwick|2010|p=60}} If he was the son of Cleopatra IV, he was probably born around 117 BC and followed around a year later by a brother, known as [[Ptolemy of Cyprus]]. In 117 BC, Ptolemy IX was governor of [[Cyprus]], but in 116 BC his father [[Ptolemy VIII]] died and he returned to Alexandria, becoming the junior co-regent of his grandmother [[Cleopatra II]] and his mother [[Cleopatra III]]. Cleopatra II died in 115 BC and shortly afterwards Cleopatra III forced Ptolemy IX to divorce his sister-wife Cleopatra IV, who was sent off to marry the [[Seleucid]] king [[Antiochus IX Cyzicenus]]. She was murdered by his rival in 114 BC. Ptolemy IX meanwhile had been remarried to Cleopatra Selene, with whom he had a daughter, [[Berenice III]].{{sfn|H\u00f6lbl|2001|p=206-207}} By 109 BC, Ptolemy IX had begun the process of introducing Ptolemy XII to public life. In that year, Ptolemy XII served as the Priest of Alexander and Ptolemaic kings (an office which Ptolemy IX otherwise held himself throughout his reign) and had a festival established in his honour in [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]].<ref>''[[Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum|SEG]]'' IX.5.</ref><ref name=CBP12>{{cite web |last1=Bennett |first1=Chris |title=Ptolemy IX|url=http://instonebrewer.com/TyndaleSites/Egypt/ptolemies/ptolemy_ix_fr.htm|website=Egyptian Royal Genealogy |accessdate=11 November 2019}}</ref> Relations between Ptolemy IX and his mother deteriorated.

In April 80 BC, [[Ptolemy XI Alexander II]], the son of Ptolemy X, was installed as her co-regent, promptly murdered her, and was himself killed by an angry Alexandrian mob. The Alexandrians then summoned Ptolemy XII to return to Egypt and assume the kingship; his brother became king of Cyprus, where he would reign until 58 BC.{{sfn|H\u00f6lbl|2001|p=222}}{{sfn|Bradford|2000|p=33}}{{sfn|Roller|2010|p=17}}\n\n==First reign (80\u201358 BC)==\n[[File:Flickr - archer10 (Dennis) - Egypt-14A-024.jpg|thumb|Egyptian-style statue of Ptolemy XII found at the Temple of the Crocodile in [[Fayoum]], Egypt.]]\n\nOn his arrival in Alexandria, in April 80 BC, Ptolemy XII was proclaimed king. His reign was officially dated as having begun on the death of his father in 81 BC, thereby eliding the reigns of Berenice III and Ptolemy X. Shortly after his accession, Ptolemy married [[Cleopatra V of Egypt|Cleopatra Tryphaena]].{{sfn|H\u00f6lbl|2001|pp=222-223}} Her parentage is uncertain - modern scholarship often interprets her as a sister,{{sfn|H\u00f6lbl|2001|pp=222-223}} but Christopher Bennett argues that she was a daughter of Ptolemy X.{{sfn|Bennett|1997|p=39}} The couple became co-regents and were encorporated into the Ptolemaic dynastic cult together as the ''Theoi Philopatores kai Philadelphoi'' (Father-loving and Sibling-loving Gods). This title was probably meant to reinforce Ptolemy XII's claim to the throne in the face of claims that his parentage meant that he was an illegitimate son of Ptolemy IX and therefore not entitled to rule.{{sfn|H\u00f6lbl|2001|pp=222-223}} \n\nIn 76 BC, the [[High Priest of Ptah]] in [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] died and Ptolemy XII travelled to Memphis to appoint his fourteen-year-old son, [[Pasherienptah III]], as the new High Priest. In turn, Pasherienptah III crowned Ptolemy as [[Pharaoh]] and then went to Alexandria, where he was appointed as Ptolemy XII's 'prophet'. These encounters are described in detail on Pasherienptah's funerary stela, ''Stele BM 866'', and they demonstrate the extremely close and mutually reinforcing relationship that had developed between the Ptolemaic kings and the Memphite priesthood by this date.{{sfn|H\u00f6lbl|2001|pp=222-223}}\n\nIn August 69 BC, Cleopatra V ceases to be mentioned as co-regent. The images of her that had been carved on the main [[Pylon (architecture)|pylon]] of the [[Temple of Horus]] at [[Edfu]] were covered over at this time. The reason for this sudden shift is unknown, but presumably she was divorced at this time.{{sfn|H\u00f6lbl|2001|pp=222-223}} Ptolemy adopted a new royal epithet ''Neos Dionysos'' (New Dionysus) at some time after this; Chris Bennett proposes that the epithet was linked to the break with Cleopatra.<ref name=CBP12/>\n\n===Relations with Rome===\n[[File:Pompey the Great.jpg|thumb|[[Pompey]], Ptolemy XII's key ally in Rome.]]\n[[File:Ptolemy XII Auletes - 185.jpg|thumb|Relief of Ptolemy XII from the [[Temple of Kom Ombo|double temple at Kom Ombo]].]]\n[[File:Edfu Temple 9609.JPG|thumb|First [[pylon (architecture)|pylon]] at [[Edfu]] [[Temple of Edfu|Temple]], which Ptolemy XII decorated with figures of himself smiting the enemy.]]\nWhen Ptolemy X had died in 88 BC, his will had left Egypt to Rome in the event that he had no surviving heirs. Although the Romans had not acted on this, the possibility that they might forced the following Ptolemies to adopt a careful and respectful policy towards Rome.{{sfn|H\u00f6lbl|2001|pp=223-224}}{{sfn|Siani-Davies|1997|p=307}} Ptolemy XII continued this pro-Roman policy in order to protect himself and secure his dynasty's fate. However, Egypt came under increasing Roman pressure nevertheless. In 65 BC, the [[Roman censor]], [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] proposed that the Romans annex of Egypt.<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Crassus'' 13.2</ref> This proposal failed in the face of opposition from [[Quintus Lutatius Catulus]] and [[Cicero]]. In light of this crisis, however, Ptolemy XII began to expend significant resources on bribing Roman politicians to support his interests. In 63 BC, when [[Pompey]] was reorganising Syria and Anatolia following his victory in the [[Third Mithridatic War]], Ptolemy sought to form a relationship with Pompey by sending him a golden crown. Ptolemy also provided pay and maintenance for 8,000 cavalry to Pompey for his war with [[Judaea]]. He also asked Pompey to come to Alexandria and help to put down a revolt which had apparently broken out in Egypt; Pompey refused.<ref>[[Appian]], ''Mithridatica'' 114; [[Josephus]], ''Antiquities of the Jews'' 14.35</ref>{{sfn|H\u00f6lbl|2001|pp=223-224}}{{sfn|Bradford|2000|p=35}}\n\nThe money required for these bribes was enormous. Initially, Ptolemy XII funded them by raising taxes. A strike by farmers of royal land in [[Herakleopolis]] which is attested in a papyrus document from 61/60 BC has been interpreted as a sign of widespread discontent with this taxation. Increasingly, Ptolemy XII also had recourse to loans from Roman bankers, such as [[Gaius Rabirius Postumus]]. This gave the Romans even more leverage over his regime and meant that the fate of Egypt became an increasingly immediate issue in Roman politics.{{sfn|H\u00f6lbl|2001|pp=223-224}} \n\nFinally, in 60 BC, Ptolemy XII travelled to Rome, where the [[First Triumvirate]], composed of Pompey, Crassus, and [[Julius Caesar]], had just taken power, in order to negotiate official recognition of his kingship. Ptolemy paid Pompey and Caesar six thousand [[Talent (measurement)|talents]] - an enormous sum, equivalent to the total annual revenue of Egypt.<ref>[[Suetonius]] ''Life of Julius Caesar'' 54.3</ref> In return, a formal alliance or ''foedus'' was formed. The [[Roman Senate]] recognised Ptolemy as king and Caesar passed a law that added Ptolemy to the list of friends and allies of the people of Rome (''amici et socii populi Romani'') in 59 BC.<ref>[[Caesar]] ''[[Commentarii de Bello Civili|Bellum Civile]]'' 3.107; [[Cicero]], ''Pro Rabirio Postumo'' 3; Cicero, ''Letter to Atticus'' 2.16.2</ref>{{sfn|Siani-Davies|1997|p=316}}{{sfn|H\u00f6lbl|2001|pp=225-226}} \n \nIn 58 BC, the Romans [[Roman Cyprus|took control of Cyprus]], causing its ruler, Ptolemy XII's brother, to commit suicide.{{sfn|Roller|2010|p=22}} Ptolemy XII took no action in response to his brother's death and Cyprus remained a Roman province until returned to Ptolemaic control by Julius Caesar in 48 BC.{{sfn|H\u00f6lbl|2001|pp=226-227}}\n\n==Exile in Rome (58-55 BC)==\n{{further|Early life of Cleopatra}}\nThe bribery policy had been unpopular in Egypt for a long time, both because of its obsequiousness and because of the heavy tax burden that it entailed, but the annexation of Cyprus demonstrated its failure and enraged the people of Alexandria. The courtiers in Alexandria forced Ptolemy to step down from the thone and leave Egypt.<ref>[[Cassius Dio]] 39.12; [[Plutarch]], ''Life of Pompey'' 49.7.</ref> He was replaced by his daughter Berenice IV, who ruled jointly with Cleopatra Tryphaena, who is probably Ptolemy XII's former wife but may be an otherwise unattested daughter. Following Cleopatra Tryphaena's death a year later, Berenice ruled alone from 57 to 56 BC.{{sfn|Siani-Davies|1997|p=324}}{{sfn|H\u00f6lbl|2001|pp=226-227}}\n\n[[File:Denier \u00e0 l'effigie de Pomp\u00e9e.jpg|thumb|left|A [[denarius]] of Pompey minted 49-48 BC]]\nTaking his daughter Cleopatra with him, Ptolemy fled for the safety of Rome.{{sfn|Bradford|2000|p=37}} On the way, he stopped in [[Rhodes]] where the exiled [[Cato the Younger]] offered him advice on how to approach the Roman aristocracy, but no tangible support. In Rome, Ptolemy XII prosecuted his restitution but met opposition from certain members of the Senate. His old ally Pompey housed the exiled king and his daughter and argued on behalf of Ptolemy's restoration in the Senate.<ref>[[Strabo]] ''Geography'' 17.1.11; [[Cassius Dio]] 39.14.3</ref>{{sfn|H\u00f6lbl|2001|pp=226-227}} During this time, Roman creditors realized that they would not get the return on their loans to the king without his restoration.{{sfn|Siani-Davies|1997|p=323}} In 57 BC, pressure from the Roman public forced the Senate's decision to restore Ptolemy. However, Rome did not wish to invade Egypt to restore the king, since the [[Sibylline books]] stated that if an Egyptian king asked for help and Rome proceeded with military intervention, great dangers and difficulties would occur.{{sfn|Bradford|2000|pp=39\u201340}}\n\nEgyptians heard rumours of Rome's possible intervention and disliked the idea of their exiled king's return. The Roman historian [[Cassius Dio]] wrote that a group of one hundred men were sent as envoys from Egypt to make their case to the Romans against Ptolemy XII's restoration.

Upon regaining power, Ptolemy acted against Berenice, and along with her supporters, she was executed. Ptolemy XII maintained his grip on power in Alexandria with the assistance of around two thousand Roman soldiers and mercenaries, known as the [[Gabiniani]]. This arrangement enabled Rome to exert power over Ptolemy, who ruled until he fell ill in 51 BC.{{sfn|Siani-Davies|1997|p=338}} On 31 May 52 BC his daughter Cleopatra VII was named as his coregent.{{sfn|Roller|2010|p=27}}\n\nAt the moment of Ptolemy XII's restoration, Roman creditors demanded the repayment of their loans, but the Alexandrian treasury could not repay the king's debt. Learning from previous mistakes, Ptolemy XII shifted popular resentment of tax increases from himself to a Roman, his main creditor [[Gaius Rabirius Postumus]], whom he appointed ''[[dioiketes]]'' (minister of finance), and so in charge of debt repayment. Perhaps Gabinius had also put pressure on Ptolemy XII to appoint Rabirius, who now had direct access to the financial resources of Egypt but exploited the land too much. The king had to imprison Rabirius to protect his life from the angry people, then allowed him to escape. Rabirius immediately left Egypt and went back to Rome at the end of 54 BC. There he was accused ''de repetundis'', but defended by [[Cicero]] and probably acquitted.<ref>Cicero.</ref>{{sfn|Hu\u00df|2001|pp=696\u2013697}} Ptolemy also permitted a debasing of the coinage as an attempt to repay the loans. Near the end of Ptolemy's reign, the value of Egyptian coinage dropped to about fifty per cent of its value at the beginning of his first reign.{{sfn|Siani-Davies|1997|pp=332\u2013334}}\n\nPtolemy XII died sometime before 22 March 51 BC.{{sfn|Roller|2010|pp=53, 56}} His will stipulated that Cleopatra VII and her brother Ptolemy XIII should rule Egypt together.

The railway company was in the privileged position of being allowed to retain surplus land; from 1919 this was developed for housing by the nominally independent [[Metropolitan Railway Country Estates|Metropolitan Railway Country Estates Limited]] (MRCE). The term \"Metro-land\" was coined by the Met's marketing department in 1915 when the ''Guide to the Extension Line'' became the ''Metro-land guide''. It promoted a dream of a modern home in beautiful countryside with a fast railway service to central London until the Met was absorbed into the  [[London Passenger Transport Board]] in 1933.\n\n==Metropolitan Railway==\n[[File:Metro-land-map.jpg|right|thumb|Map of \"Metro-land\", from the 1924 ''Metro-land'' booklet published by the Metropolitan Railway]]\n[[File:Electric locomotive and train, Metropolitan Railway (CJ Allen, Steel Highway, 1928).jpg|thumb|Metropolitan Railway electric locomotive and train (c.1928)]]\nThe [[Metropolitan Railway]] was a passenger and goods railway that served London from 1863 to 1933, its mainline heading north from the capital's financial heart in [[City of London|the City]] to what were to become the [[Middlesex]] suburbs. Its first line connected the mainline railway termini at {{stnlnk|Paddington}}, {{stnlnk|Euston}} and [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]] to the City, and when, on 10 January 1863, this line opened with gas-lit wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives, it was the world's first underground railway.{{sfn|Green|1987|pp=3\u20135}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Dennis|last2=Pigram|first2=Ron|year=1988|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]]|title=The Golden Years of the Metropolitan Railway and the Metro-land Dream|isbn=1-870630-11-4|page=32}}</ref> When, in 1871 plans were presented for an underground railway in Paris, it was called the ''[[Paris M\u00e9tro|M\u00e9tropolitain]]'' in imitation of the line in London.<ref>{{cite book|first=Benson|last=Bobrick|title=Labyrinths of Iron|url=https://archive.org/details/labyrinthsofiron00bobr|url-access=registration|publisher=Newsweek books|year=1981|page=[https://archive.org/details/labyrinthsofiron00bobr/page/142 142]}}</ref> The modern word [[rapid transit|metro]] is a short form of the French word. The railway was soon extended from both ends and northwards via a branch from [[Baker Street tube station|Baker Street]]. It reached [[Hammersmith tube station (Circle and Hammersmith & City lines)|Hammersmith]] in 1864, [[Richmond station (London)|Richmond]] in 1877 and completed the ''[[Circle line (London Underground)|Inner Circle]]'' in 1884,{{sfn|Green|1987|pp=7\u201310}} but the most important route became the line north into the Middlesex countryside, where it stimulated the development of new suburbs. [[Harrow-on-the-Hill station|Harrow]] was reached in 1880, and the line eventually extended as far as {{stnlnk|Verney Junction}} in [[Buckinghamshire]], more than {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=off}} from Baker Street and the centre of London. From the end of the 19th century, the railway shared tracks with the [[Great Central Railway]] route out of {{rws|Marylebone}}.{{sfn|Green|1987|pp=11\u201314}}\n\nElectric traction was introduced in 1905 with [[electric multiple unit]]s operating services between Uxbridge, Harrow-on-the-Hill and Baker Street. To remove steam and smoke from the tunnels in central London, the Metropolitan Railway purchased [[Metropolitan Railway electric locomotives|electric locomotives]], and these were exchanged for steam locomotives on trains at Harrow from 1908.{{sfn|Green|1987|pp=24\u201326}} To improve services, more powerful electric and steam locomotives were purchased in the 1920s.

Concerned that Parliament might reconsider the unique position the Met held, the railway company sought legal advice. The legal opinion was that although the Met had authority to hold land, it had none to develop it, so an independent company was created, although all but one of its directors were also directors of the railway company.{{sfn|Jackson|1986|pp=241\u2013242}} The MRCE went on to develop estates at [[Kingsbury, London|Kingsbury Garden Village]] near [[Neasden]], [[Wembley Park]], Cecil Park and Grange Estate at [[Pinner]] and the Cedars Estate at [[Rickmansworth]] and create places such as [[Harrow Garden Village]].{{sfn|Green|1987|p=43}}{{sfn|Jackson|1986|pp=241\u2013242}}\n\nThe term Metro-land was coined by the Met's marketing department in 1915 when the ''Guide to the Extension Line'' became the ''Metro-land'' guide, priced at 1[[\u00a3sd|d]].

In 1906, when [[Edward Watkin|Watkin]]\u2019s Tower closed, the Tower Company had become the Wembley Park Estate Company (later Wembley Ltd.), with the aim of developing [[Wembley]] as a residential suburb.\n\nUnlike other railways, from an early date the Metropolitan Railway had bought land alongside its line and then developed housing on it.  In the 1880s and 1890s it had done so with the Willesden Park Estate near Willesden Green station, and in the early 1900s it developed on land in Pinner, as well as planning the expansion of [[Wembley Park]].\n\nIn 1915 by the Metropolitan Railway\u2019s publicity department had created the term Metro-land.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/sep/10/metroland-100-years-england-original-vision-suburbia|title=Metroland, 100 years on: what's become of England\u2019s original vision of suburbia?|last=Forrest|first=Adam|date=2015-09-10|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-07-20}}</ref>  It was used as the new name for the company\u2019s annual guide to the places it served (known as Guide to the Extension Line prior to 1915).  The ''Metro-land'' guide, although partly written to attract walkers and day trippers, was clearly primarily intended to encourage the building of suburban homes and create middle-class commuters who would use the Metropolitan Railway\u2019s trains for all their needs.  It was published annually until 1932, but when the Metropolitan became part of London Transport in 1933 the term and guide were abandoned.  By then North-West London was well on the road to its reputation for suburbanisation.\n\nThe 1924 ''Metro-land'' guide describes [[Wembley Park]] as \"rapidly developed of recent years as a residential district\", pointing out that there are several golf courses within a few minutes journey of it.\n\nOver the years during which the guide was published, large numbers of Londoners moved out to the new estates in North-West London.  Some of these estates were developed by MRCE, a company that Robert H. Selbie, the Metropolitan Railway\u2019s General Manager, set up in 1919.  It would eventually build houses along the line, from Neasden reaching far out as Amersham.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://middlesexcountypress.com/?page_id=675|title=Metroland: the golden age of mock Tudor {{!}} MIDDLESEX: A ROUNDTRIP IN NOWHERE LAND|website=middlesexcountypress.com|access-date=2016-07-20}}</ref>\n\nOne of the earliest of these MRCE developments was a 123-acre one at Chalkhill, within the bounds of what was [[Repton]]\u2019s [[Wembley Park]].  MRCE acquired the land shortly after it was created and began selling plots in 1921.  The railway even put in a siding to bring building materials to the estate.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of Wembley|last=Hewlett|first=Geoffrey|publisher=Brent Library Service|year=1979|isbn=|location=|pages=215|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe term \u2018Metroland\u2019 (usually seen now without the hyphen) has become shorthand for the suburban areas that were built in North-West London and in Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire and Middlesex following the Metropolitan branches. It had become immortalised well before the guide stopped being published.

She reappears, with the title Lady Metroland, in two more of Waugh\u2019s novels; ''Vile Bodies'' (1930) and ''A Handful of Dust'' (1934).\n\nThe [[British Empire Exhibition]] further encouraged the new phenomenon of suburban development.   Wembley\u2019s sewerage was improved, many roads in the area were straightened and widened and new bus services began operating.  Visitors were steadily introduced to Wembley and some later moved to the area when houses had been built to accommodate them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://brent.gov.uk/media/387392/Wembley.pdf|title=Places in Brent Wembley and Tokyngton|last=Barres-Baker|first=Malcolm|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-20}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1921 and 1928 season ticket sales at [[Wembley Park tube station|Wembley Park]] and neighbouring Metropolitan stations rose by over 700%.  Like the rest of West London, most of [[Wembley Park]] and its environs was fully developed, largely with relatively low-density suburban housing, by 1939.\n\n===Absorption of the Met===\nOn 1 July 1933 the Metropolitan Railway amalgamated with other Underground railways, tramway companies and bus operators to form the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] (LPTB), and the railway became the [[Metropolitan line]] of London Transport. The LPTB was not interested in running goods and freight services and the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) took over all freight traffic. At the same time the LNER became responsible for hauling passenger trains with steam locomotives north of Rickmansworth. The lines north of Aylesbury to Verney Junction and Brill were closed; last train to Brill ran on 30 November 1935 and to Quainton Road and Verney Junction on 2 April 1936.

Sims]] had incorporated the term in verse: \"I know a land where the wild flowers grow/Near, near at hand if by train you go,/Metroland, Metroland\".\n\nBy the 1920s, the word was so ingrained in the consciousness that, in [[Evelyn Waugh]]\u2019s novel, ''[[Decline and Fall]]'' (1928), the Hon Margot Beste-Chetwynd took Viscount Metroland as her second husband. Lady Metroland's second appearance in ''[[Vile Bodies]]'' in 1930 and ''[[A Handful of Dust]]'' in 1934 further reinforces this.<ref>Waugh, Evelyn, A Handful of Dust (London, 1934), 10.</ref>\n\nMetro-land further entered the public psyche with the song ''My Little Metro-land Home'' (lyrics by Boyle Lawrence and music by Henry Thraile, 1920), while another ditty extolled the virtues of the Poplars estate at [[Ruislip]] with the assertion that \"It's a very short distance by rail on the Met/And at the gate you'll find waiting, sweet Violet\".<ref name=\"StephenHalliday\" />\n\n[[Queensbury, London|Queensbury]] and its local surroundings and characters were cited in the song \"Queensbury Station\" by the Berlin-based punk-jazz band [[The Magoo Brothers]] on their album \"Beyond Believable\", released on the Bouncing Corporation label in 1988.

The movie was based on the novel of the same name written by Julian Barnes.\n\n[[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]] recorded a song ''Metroland'' on the [[English Electric (album)|English Electric]] album. It was released as a single, with the video showing the singer dreamily gazing out from a train at an idealised suburban landscape.\n\n===\"Live in Metro-land\"===\nIn 1903 the Metropolitan developed a housing estate at Cecil Park, [[Pinner]], the first of many such enterprises over the next thirty years. Overseen by the Metropolitan's general manager from 1908 to 1930, Robert H Selbie, the railway formed its own Country Estates Company in 1919. The slogan, \"Live in Metro-land\", was even etched on the door handles of Metropolitan carriages.\n\nSome stations, such as [[Hillingdon tube station|Hillingdon]] (1923), were built specifically to serve the company's suburban developments. A number, including Wembley Park, [[Croxley tube station|Croxley Green]] (1925) and Stanmore (1932), were designed by Charles W. Clark (who was responsible also for Chiltern Court) in an [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and crafts]] \"villa\" style. These were intended to blend with their surroundings, though, in retrospect, they arguably lacked the panache and vision of [[Charles Holden]]'s striking, modern designs for the [[London Underground|Underground]] group in the late 1920s and early 1930s.\n\n===Imitators===\nNearly 70 years later the Chilterns Conservation Board was advertising \"Chilterns Country \u2013 countryside walks from rail stations\" (2004).

'The Wreck of the \"What's Her Name\"' by Ronald Bagnall & Denham Harrison (1912) contained the lines: \"The men they called for smelling-salts, the women shrieked for beer!/Good old glorious beer my lads, not arf, four alf beer!\".<ref name=\"ConstantLambert\" />}}\n\n===Town ''v.'' country===\nWith similar ambiguity, ''Metro-land'' combined idyllic photographs of rural tranquillity with advertising spreads for new, though leafy, housing developments. Herein lay the contradictions well captured by [[Leslie Thomas]] in his novel, ''The Tropic of Ruislip'' (1974): \"in the country but not of it. The fields seemed touchable and yet remote\". Writer and historian [[A. N.

With what radiant hope / Men formed this many-branched electrolier\"). In his autobiographical ''[[Summoned by Bells]]'' (1960) Betjeman recalled that \"Metroland / Beckoned us out to lanes in beechy Bucks\".\n[[File:JB Plaque.JPG|thumb|300px|Betjeman centenary: commemorative plaque unveiled by [[Candida Lycett Green]], Marylebone station, 2 September 2006]]\nDescribed much later by ''The Times'' as the \"hymnologist of Metroland\",<ref>Bill Stock & Alan Hamilton  ''The Times'', 6 January 2007{{page needed|date=December 2012}}</ref> Betjeman reached a wider audience with his celebrated documentary for BBC Television, ''[[Metro-land (TV)|Metro-land]]'', directed by [[Edward Mirzoeff]], which was first broadcast on 26 February 1973 and was released as a [[DVD]] 33 years later.

The archetypal Metro-land subjects (such as the railway station and the quiet suburb) became the settings for fiendish plots and treachery in this series and others, such as ''[[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]]'', ''[[The Baron]]'' and ''[[Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)]]'', all of which made regular use of locations within easy reach of film studios at [[Borehamwood]] and [[Pinewood Studios|Pinewood]].<ref>[http://avengerland.theavengers.tv/ Avengerland]</ref>\n\n==Escaping Metro-land==\nSome abhorred Metro-land for its predictability and sameness. A. N. Wilson observed that, although semi-detached dwellings of the kind built in the inner Metro-land suburbs in the 1930s \"aped larger houses, the stockbroker Tudorbethan of Edwardian Surrey and Middlesex\", they were in fact \"pokey\". He reflected that\n{{quote|as [the husband] went off to the nearest station every morning ... the wife, half liberated and half slave, stayed behind wondering how many of the newly invented domestic appliances they could afford to purchase, and how long the man would hold on to his job in the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Slump]]. No wonder, when war came, that so many of these suburban prisoners felt a sense of release.<ref name=\"Wilson\" />}}\n\n===Post-war attitudes===\nBy the end of the Second World War architects in general were turning their backs on suburbia; the very word tended to be used pejoratively, even contemptuously. In 1951 [[Michael Young (politician)|Michael Young]], one of the architects of the Labour Party's electoral victory in 1945, observed that \"one suburb is much like another in an atomised society. Rarely does community flourish\", while the American [[Lewis Mumford]], wrote in the ''New Yorker'' in 1953 that \"monotony and suburbanism\" were the result of the \"unimaginative\" design of Britain's post-war [[New Towns]].<ref>[[David Kynaston]] (2009) ''Family Britain 1951-57''{{page needed|date=December 2012}}</ref> When the editor of the ''Architectural Review'', [[James Maude Richards|J. M. Richards]], wrote in ''The Castles on the Ground'' (1946) that \"for all the alleged deficiencies of suburban taste ... it holds for ninety out of a hundred Englishmen an appeal which cannot be explained away as some strange instance of mass aberration\", he was, in his own words, \"scorned by my contemporaries as either an irrelevant eccentricity or a betrayal of the forward looking views of the [[Modernism|Modern]] Movement\".<ref>Quoted in David Kynaston (2007) ''Austerity Britain''{{page needed|date=December 2012}}</ref>\n\nJohn Betjeman admired [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]]'s illustrations for ''Castles on the Ground'', describing the \"fake half-timber, the leaded lights and bow windows of the Englishman's castle\" as \"the beauty of the despised, patronised suburb\".<ref>John Betjeman (ed Candida Lycett Green, 1997) ''Coming Home''{{page needed|date=December 2012}}</ref> However, as the historian [[David Kynaston]] observed sixty years later, \"the time was far from ripe for Metroland nostalgia\".<ref>David Kynaston (2007) ''Austerity Britain''{{page needed|date=December 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Julian Barnes: ''Metroland''===\n[[Valerie Grove]], who conceded that Metro-land was \"a kinder word than 'suburbia'\" and referred to the less spoilt areas beyond Rickmansworth as \"Outer Metro-land\", maintained that \"suburbia had no visible history. Anyone with any spirit ... had to get out of Metro-land to make their mark\".<ref>''Times Weekend Review'', 4 September 2004{{page needed|date=December 2012}}</ref>\n\nThus, the central character of ''[[Metroland (book)|Metroland]]'' (1980), a novel by [[Julian Barnes]] (born 1946) that was [[Metroland (1997 film)|filmed in 1997]], ended up in [[Paris]] during the disturbances of May 1968 \u2013 though, by the late 1970s, having thrown off the yearnings of his youth, he was back in Metro-land. ''Metroland'' recounted the essence of suburbia in the early 1960s and the features of daily travel by a schoolboy, Christopher Lloyd, on the Metropolitan line to and from London. During a French lesson, Christopher declared, \"''J\u2019habite Metroland''\" [\"I live in Metroland\"], because it \"sounds better than Eastwick [the fictional location of his home], stranger than Middlesex\".\n\nIn real life, some schoolboys had made similar journeys for more [[hedonistic]] reasons. Betjeman recalled that, between the wars, boys from [[Harrow School]] had used the Metropolitan for illicit excursions to [[night clubs]] in London: \"Whenever the police raided the [[Hypocrites' Club]] or the Coconut Club, the '43 or the Blue Lantern there would always be Harrovians there\".<ref>David Faber (2005) ''Speaking for England''{{page needed|date=December 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Social mobility: ''Tropic of Ruislip''===\nBetween Metro-land\u2019s heyday before the Second World War and the end of the 20th century, the proportion of [[Owner-occupier|owner-occupied]] dwellings in England, already rising fast from the mid-1920s, doubled from a third to two-thirds.<ref>Proportion of dwellings by household tenure, 1938 and 1997: ''Independent Inquiry into Inequalities in Health'' (Chair, Sir Donald Acheson), 1998</ref> In ''[[Tropic of Ruislip]]'', [[Leslie Thomas]]\u2019s humorous account of suburban sexual and social [[mores]] in the mid-1970s (adapted for television as ''Tropic'', ATV 1979), the steady flow of families from council housing on one side of the railway to an executive estate on the other side served to illustrate what was becoming known as \"[[social mobility|upward mobility]]\".{{efn|In 1962 [[Philip Goodhart]], MP for [[Beckenham]], wrote of the parliamentary by-election of that year in the Kent suburb of [[Orpington]], at which a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] majority of over 14,000 was turned into a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] victory, that \"now the extent and growth of this social mobility can be seen for the first time\"<ref>Letter to ''Daily Telegraph'', 23 March 1962, quoted in D.

However, although Plummers Park was placed close to Watford \"in the latitude of [[Ruislip]]\", it was said to be thirty miles from Central London, whereas ''Metro-land'' (1932 edition) gave the distance from Ruislip to Baker Street as 13\u00bc miles.}}) had moved south of the [[River Thames]] to [[Wimbledon (London)|Wimbledon]] or nearby [[Southfields]]. This was put down to the \"attractions of [[Victoriana]]\", which, like suburbia itself, championed at the time by Betjeman\u2019s ''Metro-land'', was coming back into fashion; however, it appeared to have just as much to do with couples following each other round in order to maintain extramarital affairs.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nAnother glimpse of Metro-land in the 1970s was provided by ''[[The Good Life (1975 TV series)|The Good Life]]'', the BBC TV comedy series (1975-8) about suburban self sufficiency. Though set in [[Surbiton]], the programme's location filming was carried out in [[Northwood, London|Northwood]], an area reached by the Metropolitan in 1885. A less benign view of Metro-land was offered in the mid [[noughties]] by the detective series, ''[[Murder in Suburbia]]'' (ITV 2004-6), which, though set in the fictional town of Middleford, was also filmed in Northwood and other parts of North West London.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n==Note on spelling==\nThe form ''Metroland'' is now in common use, but the \"brand\" was hyphenated as ''Metro-land'' or ''METRO-LAND''. Evelyn Waugh, John Betjeman (in \"Summoned by Bells\") and Julian Barnes all dispensed with the hyphen, though Betjeman's documentary of 1973 correctly used \"Metro-land\", as that was the form always employed by the Metropolitan Railway in its brochures and on the trains themselves.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Streetcar suburb]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Notelist}}\n\n===References===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book|last=Green|first=Oliver|year=1987|title=The London Underground: An illustrated history|publisher=[[Ian Allan Publishing|Ian Allan]]|isbn=0-7110-1720-4|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|title=Metro-Land|edition=British Empire Exhibition 1924 reprinted|year=2004|isbn=1-904915-00-0|editor-first=Oliver|editor-last=Green|publisher=Southbank Publishing|ref=harv|url=http://www.southbankpublishing.com/9781904915003/introduction.php|accessdate=22 April 2012|archive-url=https://archive.today/20080628202202/http://www.southbankpublishing.com/9781904915003/introduction.php|archive-date=28 June 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}\n* {{cite book|last=Foxell|first=Clive|title=Chesham Shuttle: The Story of a Metropolitan Branch Line|edition=2nd|year=1996|publisher=Clive Foxell|isbn=0-9529184-0-4|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Horne|first=Mike|title=The Metropolitan Line|year=2003|publisher=Capital Transport|isbn=1-85414-275-5|ref=harv|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/metropolitanline00mike}}\n* {{cite book|title=London's Metropolitan Railway|last=Jackson|first=Alan|year=1986|publisher=David & Charles|isbn=0-7153-8839-8|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|title=The English landscape in the twentieth century|last=Rowley|first=Trevor|year=2006|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group|Hambledon Continuum]]|isbn=1-85285-388-3|ref=harv|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/englishlandscape0000rowl}}\n* {{cite book|last=Simpson|first=Bill|title=A History of the Metropolitan Railway.

The railway company was in the privileged position of being allowed to retain surplus land; from 1919 this was developed for housing by the nominally independent [[Metropolitan Railway Country Estates|Metropolitan Railway Country Estates Limited]] (MRCE). The term \"Metro-land\" was coined by the Met's marketing department in 1915 when the ''Guide to the Extension Line'' became the ''Metro-land guide''. It promoted a dream of a modern home in beautiful countryside with a fast railway service to central London until the Met was absorbed into the  [[London Passenger Transport Board]] in 1933.\n\n==Metropolitan Railway==\n[[File:Metro-land-map.jpg|right|thumb|Map of \"Metro-land\", from the 1924 ''Metro-land'' booklet published by the Metropolitan Railway]]\n[[File:Electric locomotive and train, Metropolitan Railway (CJ Allen, Steel Highway, 1928).jpg|thumb|Metropolitan Railway electric locomotive and train (c.1928)]]\nThe [[Metropolitan Railway]] was a passenger and goods railway that served London from 1863 to 1933, its mainline heading north from the capital's financial heart in [[City of London|the City]] to what were to become the [[Middlesex]] suburbs.

In 1906, when [[Edward Watkin|Watkin]]\u2019s Tower closed, the Tower Company had become the Wembley Park Estate Company (later Wembley Ltd.), with the aim of developing [[Wembley]] as a residential suburb.\n\nUnlike other railways, from an early date the Metropolitan Railway had bought land alongside its line and then developed housing on it.  In the 1880s and 1890s it had done so with the Willesden Park Estate near Willesden Green station, and in the early 1900s it developed on land in Pinner, as well as planning the expansion of [[Wembley Park]].\n\nIn 1915 by the Metropolitan Railway\u2019s publicity department had created the term Metro-land.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/sep/10/metroland-100-years-england-original-vision-suburbia|title=Metroland, 100 years on: what's become of England\u2019s original vision of suburbia?|last=Forrest|first=Adam|date=2015-09-10|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-07-20}}</ref>  It was used as the new name for the company\u2019s annual guide to the places it served (known as Guide to the Extension Line prior to 1915).  The ''Metro-land'' guide, although partly written to attract walkers and day trippers, was clearly primarily intended to encourage the building of suburban homes and create middle-class commuters who would use the Metropolitan Railway\u2019s trains for all their needs.  It was published annually until 1932, but when the Metropolitan became part of London Transport in 1933 the term and guide were abandoned.  By then North-West London was well on the road to its reputation for suburbanisation.\n\nThe 1924 ''Metro-land'' guide describes [[Wembley Park]] as \"rapidly developed of recent years as a residential district\", pointing out that there are several golf courses within a few minutes journey of it.\n\nOver the years during which the guide was published, large numbers of Londoners moved out to the new estates in North-West London.  Some of these estates were developed by MRCE, a company that Robert H. Selbie, the Metropolitan Railway\u2019s General Manager, set up in 1919.  It would eventually build houses along the line, from Neasden reaching far out as Amersham.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://middlesexcountypress.com/?page_id=675|title=Metroland: the golden age of mock Tudor {{!}} MIDDLESEX: A ROUNDTRIP IN NOWHERE LAND|website=middlesexcountypress.com|access-date=2016-07-20}}</ref>\n\nOne of the earliest of these MRCE developments was a 123-acre one at Chalkhill, within the bounds of what was [[Repton]]\u2019s [[Wembley Park]].  MRCE acquired the land shortly after it was created and began selling plots in 1921.

She reappears, with the title Lady Metroland, in two more of Waugh\u2019s novels; ''Vile Bodies'' (1930) and ''A Handful of Dust'' (1934).\n\nThe [[British Empire Exhibition]] further encouraged the new phenomenon of suburban development.   Wembley\u2019s sewerage was improved, many roads in the area were straightened and widened and new bus services began operating.  Visitors were steadily introduced to Wembley and some later moved to the area when houses had been built to accommodate them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://brent.gov.uk/media/387392/Wembley.pdf|title=Places in Brent Wembley and Tokyngton|last=Barres-Baker|first=Malcolm|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-20}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1921 and 1928 season ticket sales at [[Wembley Park tube station|Wembley Park]] and neighbouring Metropolitan stations rose by over 700%.  Like the rest of West London, most of [[Wembley Park]] and its environs was fully developed, largely with relatively low-density suburban housing, by 1939.\n\n===Absorption of the Met===\nOn 1 July 1933 the Metropolitan Railway amalgamated with other Underground railways, tramway companies and bus operators to form the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] (LPTB), and the railway became the [[Metropolitan line]] of London Transport. The LPTB was not interested in running goods and freight services and the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) took over all freight traffic. At the same time the LNER became responsible for hauling passenger trains with steam locomotives north of Rickmansworth. The lines north of Aylesbury to Verney Junction and Brill were closed; last train to Brill ran on 30 November 1935 and to Quainton Road and Verney Junction on 2 April 1936. Quainton Road continued to be served by the LNER.{{sfn|Horne|2003|pp=54\u201356}} For a time, the LPTB used the \"Metro-land\" tag: \"Cheap fares to Metro-land and the sea\" were advertised in 1934{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} but the \"Metro-land\" brand was rapidly dropped.{{sfn|Green|2004|loc=introduction}} London Transport introduced new slogans such as \"Away by Metropolitan\" and \"Good spot, the Chilterns\".{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nSteam traction continued to be used on the outer sections of what had become the \"[[Metropolitan line]]\" until 1961. From that date Metropolitan trains ran only as far as [[Amersham tube station|Amersham]], with main line services from [[Marylebone railway station|Marylebone]] covering stations between [[Great Missenden railway station|Great Missenden]] and Aylesbury.\n\n==Defining Metro-land==\n[[File:HarrowPanorama.jpg|thumb|250px|The town of [[Harrow, London|Harrow]], referred to as the \"capital city\" of Metro-land]]\nThe ''Metro-land'' guide insisted that Metro-land was \"a country with elastic borders that each visitor can draw for himself\". Indeed, to the extent that the principal features of Metro-land were not unique to the Metropolitan, it has been invoked more generically: for example, by Kathryn Bradley-Hole writing about [[Gunnersbury Park]],<ref>''Country Life'', 22 July 2004{{page needed|date=December 2012}}</ref> and by the London ''Evening Standard'', which, in 2009, under the heading, \"Down the line into Metroland\", identified [[High Barnet]] (Northern line), [[Loughton]] (Central line) and two Metropolitan suburbs, Amersham and Rickmansworth, as \"top locations with an easy commute\".<ref>Anthea Masey in ''Evening Standard'', 21 October 2009{{page needed|date=December 2012}}</ref> Even so, ''Metro-land'' was quite firm that, so far as the Buckinghamshire Chilterns were concerned, its \"Grand Duchy\" was confined to the [[Hundred (country subdivision)|hundred]] of [[Burnham (hundred)|Burnham]]: \"the Chilterns round [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]] and the [[High Wycombe|Wycombes]] are not in Metro-land\".\n\nThe architect [[Hugh Casson]] regarded [[Harrow, London|Harrow]] as the \"capital city\" of Metro-land,<ref name=\"StephenHalliday\">Stephen Halliday (2001) ''Underground to Everywhere''{{page needed|date=December 2012}}</ref> while [[Arthur Mee]]'s ''King's England'' described [[Wembley]] as its \"epitome\".<ref>Arthur Mee, ''The King's England: London North of the Thames'' (revised Ann Saunders, 1972){{page needed|date=December 2012}}</ref>  In 2012 a writer for ''Country Life'', referring to plans to build a new high-speed rail link (\"[[HS2]]\") through the Chilterns, dismissed the style of development around Aylesbury as not \"so much suburban as just sub, there being no ''urbs''. However, the spirits lift when, down the road, you reach Waddesdon.

In similar vein, [[Chorleywood|Chorley Wood]] and [[Chenies]], later described by [[Metro-land#John Betjeman|John Betjeman]] as \"the essential Metro-land\",<ref>''Metro-land'', BBC TV 1973</ref> were \"at the gateway\" of the Chiltern Hills (of which [[Wendover]] was the \"pearl\").<ref>''Metro-land'', 1924 edition{{page needed|date=December 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Literature and songs===\n[[File:Croxley Tube Station - exterior.JPG|thumb|[[Croxley tube station|Croxley Green]] (now Croxley) station (C.

Sims]] had incorporated the term in verse: \"I know a land where the wild flowers grow/Near, near at hand if by train you go,/Metroland, Metroland\".\n\nBy the 1920s, the word was so ingrained in the consciousness that, in [[Evelyn Waugh]]\u2019s novel, ''[[Decline and Fall]]'' (1928), the Hon Margot Beste-Chetwynd took Viscount Metroland as her second husband. Lady Metroland's second appearance in ''[[Vile Bodies]]'' in 1930 and ''[[A Handful of Dust]]'' in 1934 further reinforces this.<ref>Waugh, Evelyn, A Handful of Dust (London, 1934), 10.</ref>\n\nMetro-land further entered the public psyche with the song ''My Little Metro-land Home'' (lyrics by Boyle Lawrence and music by Henry Thraile, 1920), while another ditty extolled the virtues of the Poplars estate at [[Ruislip]] with the assertion that \"It's a very short distance by rail on the Met/And at the gate you'll find waiting, sweet Violet\".<ref name=\"StephenHalliday\" />\n\n[[Queensbury, London|Queensbury]] and its local surroundings and characters were cited in the song \"Queensbury Station\" by the Berlin-based punk-jazz band [[The Magoo Brothers]] on their album \"Beyond Believable\", released on the Bouncing Corporation label in 1988.

The movie was based on the novel of the same name written by Julian Barnes.\n\n[[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]] recorded a song ''Metroland'' on the [[English Electric (album)|English Electric]] album. It was released as a single, with the video showing the singer dreamily gazing out from a train at an idealised sub-urban landscape.\n\n===\"Live in Metro-land\"===\nIn 1903 the Metropolitan developed a housing estate at Cecil Park, [[Pinner]], the first of many such enterprises over the next thirty years. Overseen by the Metropolitan's general manager from 1908 to 1930, Robert H Selbie, the railway formed its own Country Estates Company in 1919. The slogan, \"Live in Metro-land\", was even etched on the door handles of Metropolitan carriages.\n\nSome stations, such as [[Hillingdon tube station|Hillingdon]] (1923), were built specifically to serve the company's suburban developments. A number, including Wembley Park, [[Croxley tube station|Croxley Green]] (1925) and Stanmore (1932), were designed by Charles W. Clark (who was responsible also for Chiltern Court) in an [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and crafts]] \"villa\" style. These were intended to blend with their surroundings, though, in retrospect, they arguably lacked the panache and vision of [[Charles Holden]]'s striking, modern designs for the [[London Underground|Underground]] group in the late 1920s and early 1930s.\n\n===Imitators===\nNearly 70 years later the Chilterns Conservation Board was advertising \"Chilterns Country \u2013 countryside walks from rail stations\" (2004).

In his autobiographical ''[[Summoned by Bells]]'' (1960) Betjeman recalled that \"Metroland / Beckoned us out to lanes in beechy Bucks\".\n[[File:JB Plaque.JPG|thumb|300px|Betjeman centenary: commemorative plaque unveiled by [[Candida Lycett Green]], Marylebone station, 2 September 2006]]\nDescribed much later by ''The Times'' as the \"hymnologist of Metroland\",<ref>Bill Stock & Alan Hamilton  ''The Times'', 6 January 2007{{page needed|date=December 2012}}</ref> Betjeman reached a wider audience with his celebrated documentary for BBC Television, ''[[Metro-land (TV)|Metro-land]]'', directed by [[Edward Mirzoeff]], which was first broadcast on 26 February 1973 and was released as a [[DVD]] 33 years later. The critic [[Clive James]], who judged the programme \"an instant classic\", observed that \"it saw how the district had been destroyed by its own success\".<ref>''The Observer'', 15 December 1974{{page needed|date=December 2012}}</ref>\n\nTo mark the centenary of Betjeman's birth his daughter [[Candida Lycett Green]] (born 1942) spearheaded a series of celebratory railway events, including an excursion on 2 September 2006 from Marylebone to Quainton Road, now home of the [[Buckinghamshire Railway Centre]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.therailwaycentre.com/UK%20News%20Pages%20Sept%2006/030906_Betj.html|title=Betjeman 'Metroland' special from Marylebone to Quainton Road|date=3 September 2006|accessdate=8 March 2012}}</ref> Lycett Green noted of the planning of this trip that among the fine details considered were which filling to have in the baguettes on the train through Metro-land and how long it would stop on the track so that the poem \"Middlesex\" could be read over the tannoy.<ref>''Country Life'', 8 June 2006{{page needed|date=December 2012}}</ref> The event was in the tradition of earlier commemorations of \"Metro-land\", such as a centenary parade of rolling stock at [[Neasden]] in 1963 and celebrations in 2004 to mark the centenary of the Uxbridge branch.\n\n===''Avenger''land===\nMetro-land (notably west Hertfordshire) formed the backdrop for the 1960s ABC TV series ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'', whose popular imagery was deployed with a twist of fantasy. The archetypal Metro-land subjects (such as the railway station and the quiet suburb) became the settings for fiendish plots and treachery in this series and others, such as ''[[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]]'', ''[[The Baron]]'' and ''[[Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)]]'', all of which made regular use of locations within easy reach of film studios at [[Borehamwood]] and [[Pinewood Studios|Pinewood]].<ref>[http://avengerland.theavengers.tv/ Avengerland]</ref>\n\n==Escaping Metro-land==\nSome abhorred Metro-land for its predictability and sameness. A. N. Wilson observed that, although semi-detached dwellings of the kind built in the inner Metro-land suburbs in the 1930s \"aped larger houses, the stockbroker Tudorbethan of Edwardian Surrey and Middlesex\", they were in fact \"pokey\". He reflected that\n{{quote|as [the husband] went off to the nearest station every morning ... the wife, half liberated and half slave, stayed behind wondering how many of the newly invented domestic appliances they could afford to purchase, and how long the man would hold on to his job in the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Slump]]. No wonder, when war came, that so many of these suburban prisoners felt a sense of release.<ref name=\"Wilson\" />}}\n\n===Post-war attitudes===\nBy the end of the Second World War architects in general were turning their backs on suburbia; the very word tended to be used pejoratively, even contemptuously. In 1951 [[Michael Young (politician)|Michael Young]], one of the architects of the Labour Party's electoral victory in 1945, observed that \"one suburb is much like another in an atomised society. Rarely does community flourish\", while the American [[Lewis Mumford]], wrote in the ''New Yorker'' in 1953 that \"monotony and suburbanism\" were the result of the \"unimaginative\" design of Britain's post-war [[New Towns]].<ref>[[David Kynaston]] (2009) ''Family Britain 1951-57''{{page needed|date=December 2012}}</ref> When the editor of the ''Architectural Review'', [[James Maude Richards|J. M. Richards]], wrote in ''The Castles on the Ground'' (1946) that \"for all the alleged deficiencies of suburban taste ... it holds for ninety out of a hundred Englishmen an appeal which cannot be explained away as some strange instance of mass aberration\", he was, in his own words, \"scorned by my contemporaries as either an irrelevant eccentricity or a betrayal of the forward looking views of the [[Modernism|Modern]] Movement\".<ref>Quoted in David Kynaston (2007) ''Austerity Britain''{{page needed|date=December 2012}}</ref>\n\nJohn Betjeman admired [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]]'s illustrations for ''Castles on the Ground'', describing the \"fake half-timber, the leaded lights and bow windows of the Englishman's castle\" as \"the beauty of the despised, patronised suburb\".<ref>John Betjeman (ed Candida Lycett Green, 1997) ''Coming Home''{{page needed|date=December 2012}}</ref> However, as the historian [[David Kynaston]] observed sixty years later, \"the time was far from ripe for Metroland nostalgia\".<ref>David Kynaston (2007) ''Austerity Britain''{{page needed|date=December 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Julian Barnes: ''Metroland''===\n[[Valerie Grove]], who conceded that Metro-land was \"a kinder word than 'suburbia'\" and referred to the less spoilt areas beyond Rickmansworth as \"Outer Metro-land\", maintained that \"suburbia had no visible history. Anyone with any spirit ... had to get out of Metro-land to make their mark\".<ref>''Times Weekend Review'', 4 September 2004{{page needed|date=December 2012}}</ref>\n\nThus, the central character of ''[[Metroland (book)|Metroland]]'' (1980), a novel by [[Julian Barnes]] (born 1946) that was [[Metroland (1997 film)|filmed in 1997]], ended up in [[Paris]] during the disturbances of May 1968 \u2013 though, by the late 1970s, having thrown off the yearnings of his youth, he was back in Metro-land. ''Metroland'' recounted the essence of suburbia in the early 1960s and the features of daily travel by a schoolboy, Christopher Lloyd, on the Metropolitan line to and from London. During a French lesson, Christopher declared, \"''J\u2019habite Metroland''\" [\"I live in Metroland\"], because it \"sounds better than Eastwick [the fictional location of his home], stranger than Middlesex\".\n\nIn real life, some schoolboys had made similar journeys for more [[hedonistic]] reasons. Betjeman recalled that, between the wars, boys from [[Harrow School]] had used the Metropolitan for illicit excursions to [[night clubs]] in London: \"Whenever the police raided the [[Hypocrites' Club]] or the Coconut Club, the '43 or the Blue Lantern there would always be Harrovians there\".<ref>David Faber (2005) ''Speaking for England''{{page needed|date=December 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Social mobility: ''Tropic of Ruislip''===\nBetween Metro-land\u2019s heyday before the Second World War and the end of the 20th century, the proportion of [[Owner-occupier|owner-occupied]] dwellings in England, already rising fast from the mid-1920s, doubled from a third to two-thirds.<ref>Proportion of dwellings by household tenure, 1938 and 1997: ''Independent Inquiry into Inequalities in Health'' (Chair, Sir Donald Acheson), 1998</ref> In ''[[Tropic of Ruislip]]'', [[Leslie Thomas]]\u2019s humorous account of suburban sexual and social [[mores]] in the mid-1970s (adapted for television as ''Tropic'', ATV 1979), the steady flow of families from council housing on one side of the railway to an executive estate on the other side served to illustrate what was becoming known as \"[[social mobility|upward mobility]]\".{{efn|In 1962 [[Philip Goodhart]], MP for [[Beckenham]], wrote of the parliamentary by-election of that year in the Kent suburb of [[Orpington]], at which a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] majority of over 14,000 was turned into a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] victory, that \"now the extent and growth of this social mobility can be seen for the first time\"<ref>Letter to ''Daily Telegraph'', 23 March 1962, quoted in D. R. Thorpe (2010) ''Supermac: The Life of Harold Macmillan''.{{page needed|date=December 2012}}</ref>}} Another sign was that, by the end of the book, \"half the neighbourhood\" of Plummers Park (probably based on Carpenders Park, on the outskirts of [[Watford]]{{efn|In ''Tropic of Ruislip'', it was possible to hear the rattle of the Metropolitan from Plummers Park. However, although Plummers Park was placed close to Watford \"in the latitude of [[Ruislip]]\", it was said to be thirty miles from Central London, whereas ''Metro-land'' (1932 edition) gave the distance from Ruislip to Baker Street as 13\u00bc miles.}}) had moved south of the [[River Thames]] to [[Wimbledon (London)|Wimbledon]] or nearby [[Southfields]]. This was put down to the \"attractions of [[Victoriana]]\", which, like suburbia itself, championed at the time by Betjeman\u2019s ''Metro-land'', was coming back into fashion; however, it appeared to have just as much to do with couples following each other round in order to maintain extramarital affairs.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nAnother glimpse of Metro-land in the 1970s was provided by ''[[The Good Life (1975 TV series)|The Good Life]]'', the BBC TV comedy series (1975-8) about suburban self sufficiency. Though set in [[Surbiton]], the programme's location filming was carried out in [[Northwood, London|Northwood]], an area reached by the Metropolitan in 1885. A less benign view of Metro-land was offered in the mid [[noughties]] by the detective series, ''[[Murder in Suburbia]]'' (ITV 2004-6), which, though set in the fictional town of Middleford, was also filmed in Northwood and other parts of North West London.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n==Note on spelling==\nThe form ''Metroland'' is now in common use, but the \"brand\" was hyphenated as ''Metro-land'' or ''METRO-LAND''. Evelyn Waugh, John Betjeman (in \"Summoned by Bells\") and Julian Barnes all dispensed with the hyphen, though Betjeman's documentary of 1973 correctly used \"Metro-land\", as that was the form always employed by the Metropolitan Railway in its brochures and on the trains themselves.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Streetcar suburb]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Notelist}}\n\n===References===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book|last=Green|first=Oliver|year=1987|title=The London Underground: An illustrated history|publisher=[[Ian Allan Publishing|Ian Allan]]|isbn=0-7110-1720-4|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|title=Metro-Land|edition=British Empire Exhibition 1924 reprinted|year=2004|isbn=1-904915-00-0|editor-first=Oliver|editor-last=Green|publisher=Southbank Publishing|ref=harv|url=http://www.southbankpublishing.com/9781904915003/introduction.php|accessdate=22 April 2012|archive-url=https://archive.today/20080628202202/http://www.southbankpublishing.com/9781904915003/introduction.php|archive-date=28 June 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}\n* {{cite book|last=Foxell|first=Clive|title=Chesham Shuttle: The Story of a Metropolitan Branch Line|edition=2nd|year=1996|publisher=Clive Foxell|isbn=0-9529184-0-4|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Horne|first=Mike|title=The Metropolitan Line|year=2003|publisher=Capital Transport|isbn=1-85414-275-5|ref=harv|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/metropolitanline00mike}}\n* {{cite book|title=London's Metropolitan Railway|last=Jackson|first=Alan|year=1986|publisher=David & Charles|isbn=0-7153-8839-8|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|title=The English landscape in the twentieth century|last=Rowley|first=Trevor|year=2006|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group|Hambledon Continuum]]|isbn=1-85285-388-3|ref=harv|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/englishlandscape0000rowl}}\n* {{cite book|last=Simpson|first=Bill|title=A History of the Metropolitan Railway.

For systems with low binding energies, this \"lost\" mass after binding may be fractionally small, whereas for systems with high binding energies, the missing mass may be an easily measurable fraction. This missing mass may be lost during the process of binding as energy in the form of heat or light, with the removed energy corresponding to the removed mass through Einstein's equation [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|E&nbsp;=&nbsp;mc<sup>2</sup>]]. In the process of binding, the constituents of the system might enter higher energy states of the nucleus/atom/molecule while retaining their mass, and because of this, it is necessary that they are removed from the system before its mass can decrease. Once the system cools to normal temperatures and returns to ground states regarding energy levels, it will contain less mass than when it first combined and was at high energy. This loss of heat represents the \"mass deficit,\" and the heat itself retains the mass that was lost (from the point of view of the initial system). This mass will appear in any other system that absorbs the heat and gains thermal energy.<ref>E. F. Taylor and J. A. Wheeler, ''Spacetime Physics'', W.H. Freeman and Co., NY. 1992. {{ISBN|0-7167-2327-1}}, see pp. 248-9 for discussion of mass remaining constant after detonation of nuclear bombs until heat is allowed to escape.</ref>\n\nFor example, if two objects are attracting each other in space through their [[gravitational field]], the attraction force accelerates the objects, increasing their velocity, which converts their potential energy (gravity) into kinetic energy. When the particles either pass through each other without interaction or elastically repel during the collision, the gained kinetic energy (related to speed) begins to revert into potential energy, driving the collided particles apart. The decelerating particles will return to the initial distance and beyond into infinity, or stop and repeat the collision (oscillation takes place). This shows that the system, which loses no energy, does not combine (bind) into a solid object, parts of which oscillate at short distances. Therefore, to bind the particles, the kinetic energy gained due to the attraction must be dissipated by resistive force. Complex objects in collision ordinarily undergo [[inelastic collision]], transforming some kinetic energy into internal energy (heat content, which is atomic movement), which is further radiated in the form of photons - the light and heat. Once the energy to escape the gravity is dissipated in the collision, the parts will oscillate at a closer, possibly atomic, distance, thus looking like one solid object. This lost energy, necessary to overcome the potential barrier to separate the objects, is the binding energy. If this binding energy were retained in the system as heat, its mass would not decrease, whereas binding energy lost from the system as heat radiation would itself have mass. It directly represents the \"mass deficit\" of the cold, bound system.\n\nClosely analogous considerations apply in chemical and nuclear reactions. Exothermic chemical reactions in closed systems do not change mass, but do become less massive once the heat of reaction is removed, though this mass change is too small to measure with standard equipment. In [[nuclear reaction]]s, the fraction of mass that may be removed as light or heat, i.e., binding energy, is often a much larger fraction of the system mass. It may thus be measured directly as a mass difference between [[rest mass]]es of reactants and (cooled) products. This is because nuclear forces are comparatively stronger than the Coulombic forces associated with the interactions between electrons and protons that generate heat in chemistry.\n\n===Mass change===\nMass change (decrease) in bound systems, particularly atomic nuclei, has also been termed ''mass defect'', ''mass deficit'', or mass ''packing fraction''.{{citation needed|reason=I've never heard of the term packing fraction used in this context|date=December 2014}}\n\nThe difference between the unbound system calculated mass and experimentally measured mass of nucleus (mass change) is denoted as \u0394''m''. It can be calculated as follows:\n:Mass change = (unbound system calculated mass) \u2212 (measured mass of system)\n:: i.e., (sum of masses of protons and neutrons) \u2212 (measured mass of nucleus)\n\nAfter a nuclear reaction occurs that results in an excited nucleus, the energy that must be [[radiation|radiated]] or otherwise removed as binding energy in order to decay to the unexcited state may be in one of several forms. This may be electromagnetic waves, such as [[gamma radiation]]; the kinetic energy of an ejected particle, such as an electron, in [[internal conversion]] decay; or partly as the rest mass of one or more emitted particles, such as the particles of [[beta decay]]. No mass deficit can appear, in theory, until this radiation or this energy has been emitted and is no longer part of the system.\n\nWhen nucleons bind together to form a nucleus, they must lose a small amount of mass, i.e., there is a change in mass to stay bound. This mass change must be released as various types of photon or other particle energy as above, according to the relation E&nbsp;=&nbsp;mc<sup>2</sup>. Thus, after the binding energy has been removed, '''binding energy = mass change \u00d7 ''c''<sup>2</sup>'''. This energy is a measure of the forces that hold the nucleons together. It represents energy that must be resupplied from the environment for the nucleus to be broken up into individual nucleons.\n\nFor example, an atom of [[deuterium]] has a mass defect of 0.0023884 amu, and its binding energy is nearly equal to 2.23 MeV. This means that 2.23 MeV of energy are required to disintegrate an atom of deuterium.\n\nThe energy given off during either [[nuclear fusion]] or [[nuclear fission]] is the difference of the binding energies of the \"fuel,\" i.e. the initial nuclide(s), from that of the fission or fusion products. In practice, this energy may also be calculated from the substantial mass differences between the fuel and products, which uses previous measurements of the [[atomic mass]]es of known nuclides, which always have the same mass for each species. This mass difference appears once evolved heat and radiation have been removed, which is required for measuring the (rest) masses of the (non-excited) nuclides involved in such calculations.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bond energy]] and [[bond-dissociation energy]]\n*[[Gravitational binding energy]]\n*[[Ionization energy]] (binding energy of one electron)\n*[[Nuclear binding energy]]\n*[[Quantum chromodynamics binding energy]]\n*[[Semi-empirical mass formula]]\n*[[Separation energy]] (binding energy of one nucleon)\n*[[Virial mass]]\n*[[Prout's hypothesis]], an early model of the atom that did not account for [[mass defect]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nucene/nucbin.html Nuclear Binding Energy]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070830110015/http://www.science.uwaterloo.ca/~cchieh/cact/nuctek/nuclideunstable.html Mass and Nuclide Stability]\n*[http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/masses/mass.mas03 Experimental atomic mass data compiled Nov. 2003]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Binding Energy}}\n[[Category:Binding energy| ]]\n[[Category:Energy (physics)]]\n[[Category:Mass spectrometry]]\n[[Category:Nuclear physics]]\n[[Category:Forms of energy]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use American English|date = March 2019}}\n{{More citations needed|date=October 2014}}\n{{Nuclear physics}}\n\nIn physics, '''binding energy''' (also called separation energy) is the ''minimum'' [[energy]] required to disassemble a system of particles into separate parts.<ref>{{cite book| title=Modern\nPhysics from \u03b1 to Z\u00b0 |last1=Rohlf |first1=James William |date=1994 |publisher= John Wiley & Sons| isbn=0471572705 |page=20}}</ref> \n\nA bound system is typically at a lower energy level than its unbound constituents. \u00abWhen a dispersed system [...] combines, [...] the total energy of the system must decrease by an amount <math>\\Delta E</math>, the ''binding energy'' [...].

It can be calculated as follows:\n:Mass change = (unbound system calculated mass) \u2212 (measured mass of system)\n:: i.e., (sum of masses of protons and neutrons) \u2212 (measured mass of nucleus)\n\nAfter a nuclear reaction occurs that results in an excited nucleus, the energy that must be [[radiation|radiated]] or otherwise removed as binding energy in order to decay to the unexcited state may be in one of several forms. This may be electromagnetic waves, such as [[gamma radiation]]; the kinetic energy of an ejected particle, such as an electron, in [[internal conversion]] decay; or partly as the rest mass of one or more emitted particles, such as the particles of [[beta decay]]. No mass deficit can appear, in theory, until this radiation or this energy has been emitted and is no longer part of the system.\n\nWhen nucleons bind together to form a nucleus, they must lose a small amount of mass, i.e., there is a change in mass to stay bound. This mass change must be released as various types of photon or other particle energy as above, according to the relation E&nbsp;=&nbsp;mc<sup>2</sup>. Thus, after the binding energy has been removed, '''binding energy = mass change \u00d7 ''c''<sup>2</sup>'''. This energy is a measure of the forces that hold the nucleons together. It represents energy that must be resupplied from the environment for the nucleus to be broken up into individual nucleons.\n\nFor example, an atom of [[deuterium]] has a mass defect of 0.0023884 amu, and its binding energy is nearly equal to 2.23 MeV. This means that 2.23 MeV of energy are required to disintegrate an atom of deuterium.\n\nThe energy given off during either [[nuclear fusion]] or [[nuclear fission]] is the difference of the binding energies of the \"fuel,\" i.e. the initial nuclide(s), from that of the fission or fusion products. In practice, this energy may also be calculated from the substantial mass differences between the fuel and products, which uses previous measurements of the [[atomic mass]]es of known nuclides, which always have the same mass for each species. This mass difference appears once evolved heat and radiation have been removed, which is required for measuring the (rest) masses of the (non-excited) nuclides involved in such calculations.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bond energy]] and [[bond-dissociation energy]]\n*[[Gravitational binding energy]]\n*[[Ionization energy]] (binding energy of one electron)\n*[[Nuclear binding energy]]\n*[[Quantum chromodynamics binding energy]]\n*[[Semi-empirical mass formula]]\n*[[Separation energy]] (binding energy of one nucleon)\n*[[Virial mass]]\n*[[Prout's hypothesis]], an early model of the atom that did not account for [[mass defect]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nucene/nucbin.html Nuclear Binding Energy]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070830110015/http://www.science.uwaterloo.ca/~cchieh/cact/nuctek/nuclideunstable.html Mass and Nuclide Stability]\n*[http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/masses/mass.mas03 Experimental atomic mass data compiled Nov. 2003]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Binding Energy}}\n[[Category:Binding energy| ]]\n[[Category:Energy (physics)]]\n[[Category:Mass spectrometry]]\n[[Category:Nuclear physics]]\n[[Category:Forms of energy]]\n", "name_user": "Stiglich", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_energy"}
