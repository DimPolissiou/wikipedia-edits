Computed by detecting a repeating cycle in the pattern, and skipping ahead to any requested generation.]]\n'''Hashlife''' is a [[Memoization|memoized]] [[algorithm]] for computing the long-term fate of a given starting configuration in [[Conway's Game of Life]] and related [[cellular automaton|cellular automata]], much more quickly than would be possible using alternative algorithms that simulate each time step of each cell of the automaton. The algorithm was first described by [[Bill Gosper]] in the early 1980s while he was engaged in research at the [[Xerox Palo Alto Research Center]]. Hashlife was originally implemented on [[Symbolics]] [[Lisp machine]]s with the aid of the [[Flavors (programming language)|Flavors]] extension.\n\n==Hashlife==\nHashlife is designed to exploit large amounts of spatial and temporal [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]] in most Life rules. For example, in [[Conway's Game of Life|Conway's Life]], many seemingly random patterns end up as collections of simple [[still life (CA)|still lifes]] and [[oscillator (CA)|oscillators]].\n\n===Representation===\nThe field is typically treated as a theoretically [[infinity|infinite]] grid, with the [[pattern (CA)|pattern]] in question centered near the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]]. A [[quadtree]] is used to represent the field. Given a square of 2<sup>2''k''</sup> cells, 2<sup>''k''</sup> on a side, at the ''k''th level of the tree, the hash table stores the 2<sup>''k''\u22121</sup>-by-2<sup>''k''\u22121</sup> square of cells in the center, 2<sup>''k''\u22122</sup> generations in the future.  For example, for a 4\u00d74 square it stores the 2\u00d72 center, one generation forward; and for an 8\u00d78 square it stores the 4\u00d74 center, two generations forward.\n\n===Hashing===\nWhile a quadtree trivially has far more [[computational overhead|overhead]] than other simpler representations (such as using a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of [[bit]]s), it allows for various optimizations. As the name suggests, the algorithm uses [[hash table]]s to store the nodes of the quadtree. Many subpatterns in the tree are usually identical to each other; for example the pattern being studied may contain many copies of the same [[spaceship (CA)|spaceship]], or even large swathes of empty space. These subpatterns will all [[hash function|hash]] to the same position in the hash table, and thus many copies of the same subpattern can be stored using the same hash table entry. In addition, these subpatterns only need to be evaluated once, not once per copy as in other Life algorithms.\n\nThis itself leads to significant improvements in resource requirements; for example a generation of the various [[breeder (CA)|breeders]] and [[spacefiller (CA)|spacefillers]], which grow at [[polynomial]] speeds, can be evaluated in Hashlife using [[logarithmic growth|logarithmic]] space and time.\n\n===Superspeed and caching===\nA further speedup for many patterns can be achieved by evolving different nodes at different speeds. For example, one could compute twice the number of generations forward for a node at the (''k''+1)-th level compared to one at the ''k''th. For sparse or repetitive patterns such as the classical [[gun (CA)|glider gun]], this can result in tremendous speedups, allowing one to compute ''bigger'' patterns at ''higher'' generations ''faster'', sometimes [[exponential growth|exponentially]]. To take full advantage of this feature, subpatterns from past generations should be [[cache (computing)|saved]] as well.\n\nSince different patterns are allowed to run at different speeds, some implementations, like Gosper's own <code>hlife</code> program, do not have an interactive display, but simply compute a preset end result for a starting pattern, usually run from the [[command line]]. More recent programs such as [[Golly (program)|Golly]], however, have a graphical interface that can drive a Hashlife-based engine.\n\nThe typical behavior of a Hashlife program on a conducive pattern is as follows: first the algorithm runs slower compared to other algorithms because of the constant overhead associated with [[hash function|hashing]] and building the [[quadtree|tree]]; but later, enough data will be gathered and its speed will increase tremendously \u2013 the rapid increase in speed is often described as \"[[exponential growth|exploding]]\".\n\n==Drawbacks==\nLike many [[Memoization|memoized]] codes, Hashlife can consume significantly more [[computer memory|memory]] than other algorithms, especially on moderate-sized patterns with a lot of entropy, or which contain subpatterns poorly aligned to the bounds of the quadtree nodes (i.e. power-of-two sizes); the cache is a vulnerable component. It can also consume more time than other algorithms on these patterns. [[Golly (program)|Golly]], among other Life simulators, has options for toggling between Hashlife and conventional algorithms.\n\nHashlife is also significantly more complex to [[computer programming|implement]]. For example, it needs a dedicated [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collector]] to remove unused nodes from the cache.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Purely functional data structure]], of which the hashed quadtree is one\n\n==References==\n* {{cite journal\n    | last=Gosper | first=Bill\n    | year=1984\n    | title=Exploiting Regularities in Large Cellular Spaces\n    | journal=Physica D\n    | publisher=Elsevier\n    | volume=10\n    | issue=1-2\n    | pages=75\u201380\n    | doi=10.1016/0167-2789(84)90251-3\n}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ericweisstein.com/encyclopedias/life/HashLife.html HashLife from Eric Weisstein's Treasure Trove of Life]\n* [http://tomas.rokicki.com/hlife/ Tomas Rokicki's implementation of hashlife]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060210065034/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_h.htm#hashlife Entry] in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20160712171724/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_home.htm Life Lexicon]\n* [http://www.ddj.com/dept/ai/184406478 Explanation of the algorithm] from ''[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]''\n* [https://jennyhasahat.github.io/hashlife.html Gosper's Algorithm (Hashlife) Explained]\n\n{{Conway's Game of Life}}\n\n[[Category:Cellular automaton software]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Algorithm for speeding up cellular automaton simulations}}\n{{No footnotes|date=September 2016}}\n[[File:Turing Machine in Golly.png|thumb|379px|right|The 6,366,548,773,467,669,985,195,496,000 (6 octillionth) generation of a [[Turing machine]] in [[Conway's Game of Life|Life]] computed in less than 30 seconds on an [[Intel Core]] Duo 2GHz CPU using Hashlife in [[Golly (program)|Golly]].

Of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]], Pennsylvania is the only state that does not border the [[Atlantic Ocean]].\n\nThe boundaries of the state are the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]] (39\u00b043' N) to the south, the [[Twelve-Mile Circle]] on the Pennsylvania-Delaware border, the [[Delaware River]] to the east, 80\u00b031' W to the west and the [[42nd parallel north|42\u00b0 N]] to the north, except for a short segment on the western end, where a triangle extends north to [[Lake Erie]].\n\nCities include [[Philadelphia]], [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]], [[Lebanon, Pennsylvania|Lebanon]] and [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]] in the southeast, [[Pittsburgh]] in the southwest, the tri-cities of [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]], and [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]] in the central east (known as the [[Lehigh Valley]]). The [[Northeastern Pennsylvania|northeast]] includes the former anthracite coal mining cities of [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]], [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]], [[Pittston, Pennsylvania|Pittston]], and [[Hazleton, Pennsylvania|Hazleton]]. [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]] is located in the northwest.

Straddling two major zones, the majority of the state, except for the southeastern corner, has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfa''). The southern portion of the state has a [[humid subtropical]] climate. The largest city, [[Philadelphia]], has some characteristics of the [[humid subtropical climate]] (K\u00f6ppen ''Cfa'') that covers much of [[Delaware]] and [[Maryland]] to the south.\n\nSummers are generally hot and humid. Moving toward the mountainous interior of the state, the winter climate becomes colder, the number of cloudy days increases, and snowfall amounts are greater. Western areas of the state, particularly locations near [[Lake Erie]], can receive over {{convert|100|in|cm}} of snowfall annually, and the entire state receives plentiful precipitation throughout the year. The state may be subject to severe weather from spring through summer into autumn. Tornadoes occur annually in the state, sometimes in large numbers, such as 30 recorded tornadoes in 2011; generally speaking, these tornadoes do not cause significant damage.<ref>[http://www.homefacts.com/tornadoes/Pennsylvania.html/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517123642/http://www.homefacts.com/tornadoes/Pennsylvania.html/ |date=May 17, 2015 }}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;\"|\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly Average High and Low Temperatures For Various Pennsylvania Cities (in \u00b0F)\n|-\n!

The paper money was called [[Colonial Scrip]]. The Colony issued \"bills of credit\", which were as good as gold or silver coins because of their legal tender status. Since they were issued by the government and not a banking institution, it was an interest-free proposition, largely defraying the expense of the government and therefore taxation of the people.

The Asian population swelled by almost 60%, which was fueled by Indian, Vietnamese, and Chinese immigration, as well the many Asian transplants moving to Philadelphia from New York. The rapid growth of this community has given Pennsylvania one of the largest Asian populations in the nation by numerical values.

The state voted for the Democratic ticket for president in every election between 1992 and 2012. During the 2008 election campaign, a recruitment drive saw registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by 1.2 million. However, Pennsylvania has a history of electing Republican senators. From 2009 to 2011, the state was represented by two Democratic senators for the first time since 1947. In 2010, Republicans recaptured a U.S. Senate seat as well as a majority of the state's congressional seats, control of both chambers of the state legislature and the governor's mansion. Democrats won back the governor's mansion four years later in the [[Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, 2014|2014 election]].

Republican strength was concentrated in the Philadelphia suburbs, as well as the more rural areas in the central, northeastern, and western portions. The latter counties have long been among the most conservative areas in the nation. Since 1992, however, the Philadelphia suburbs have swung Democratic; the brand of Republicanism there was traditionally a moderate one. The Pittsburgh suburbs, historically a Democratic stronghold, have swung more Republican since the turn of the millennium.\n\nDemocratic political consultant [[James Carville]] once pejoratively described Pennsylvania as \"Philadelphia in the east, Pittsburgh in the west and Alabama in the middle\". Political analysts and editorials refer to central Pennsylvania as the \"T\" in statewide elections. Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Scranton/Wilkes-Barre generally vote for Democratic candidates, while the majority of the counties in the central part of the state vote Republican. As a result, maps showing the results of statewide elections invariably form a \"T\" shape.\n\n====Taxation====\n\nPennsylvania has the 10th-highest tax burden in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://taxfoundation.org/state-tax-climate/pennsylvania|title=The facts on Pennsylvania's Tax Climate|publisher=Tax Foundation|accessdate=August 22, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815104910/http://taxfoundation.org/state-tax-climate/pennsylvania|archive-date=August 15, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Residents pay a total of $83.7 billion in state and local taxes with a per capita average of $6,640 annually.

The [[Northeastern Pennsylvania|northeast]] includes the former anthracite coal mining cities of [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]], [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]], [[Pittston, Pennsylvania|Pittston]], and [[Hazleton, Pennsylvania|Hazleton]]. [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]] is located in the northwest.

Straddling two major zones, the majority of the state, except for the southeastern corner, has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfa''). The southern portion of the state has a [[humid subtropical]] climate. The largest city, [[Philadelphia]], has some characteristics of the [[humid subtropical climate]] (K\u00f6ppen ''Cfa'') that covers much of [[Delaware]] and [[Maryland]] to the south.\n\nSummers are generally hot and humid. Moving toward the mountainous interior of the state, the winter climate becomes colder, the number of cloudy days increases, and snowfall amounts are greater. Western areas of the state, particularly locations near [[Lake Erie]], can receive over {{convert|100|in|cm}} of snowfall annually, and the entire state receives plentiful precipitation throughout the year. The state may be subject to severe weather from spring through summer into autumn. Tornadoes occur annually in the state, sometimes in large numbers, such as 30 recorded tornadoes in 2011; generally speaking, these tornadoes do not cause significant damage.<ref>[http://www.homefacts.com/tornadoes/Pennsylvania.html/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517123642/http://www.homefacts.com/tornadoes/Pennsylvania.html/ |date=May 17, 2015 }}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;\"|\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly Average High and Low Temperatures For Various Pennsylvania Cities (in \u00b0F)\n|-\n!

The significant growth of the Hispanic population is due to immigration to the state mainly from Puerto Rico, which is a US territory, but to a lesser extent from countries such as the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and various Central and South American nations, as well as from the wave of Hispanics leaving New York and New Jersey for safer and more affordable living. The Asian population swelled by almost 60%, which was fueled by Indian, Vietnamese, and Chinese immigration, as well the many Asian transplants moving to Philadelphia from New York. The rapid growth of this community has given Pennsylvania one of the largest Asian populations in the nation by numerical values. The Black and African American population grew by 13%, which was the largest increase in that population amongst the state's peers (New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Illinois, and Michigan).

[[swing state]]. It supported the losing candidate in a presidential election only twice from 1932 to 1988, ([[Herbert Hoover]] in 1932 and [[Hubert Humphrey]] in 1968). Since 1992, Pennsylvania has been trending Democratic in Presidential elections, voting for Bill Clinton twice by large margins, and slightly closer in 2000 for Al Gore. In the 2004 Presidential Election, Senator [[John F. Kerry]] beat President [[George W. Bush]] in Pennsylvania 2,938,095 (50.92%) to 2,793,847 (48.42%). In the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 Presidential Election]], Democrat [[Barack Obama]] defeated Republican [[John McCain]] in Pennsylvania, 3,184,778 (54%) to 2,584,088 (44%). Most recently, in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 Presidential Election]], [[Donald Trump]] became the first Republican candidate to win the state since 1988, winning the state 48.6% to 47.8%.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://lancasteronline.com/news/local/donald-trump-becomes-st-republican-to-win-pennsylvania-since/article_9173e044-a647-11e6-885f-a35dd164ac8c.html|title=Donald Trump becomes 1st Republican to win Pennsylvania since 1988|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=LancasterOnline|access-date=November 13, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112051813/http://lancasteronline.com/news/local/donald-trump-becomes-st-republican-to-win-pennsylvania-since/article_9173e044-a647-11e6-885f-a35dd164ac8c.html|archive-date=November 12, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The state holds 20 [[United States Electoral College|electoral]] votes.<ref name=\"PAFacts\">{{cite web|url=https://pasdc.hbg.psu.edu/sdc/pasdc_files/pastats/PAFacts_2017.pdf|title=Pennsylvania Facts 2017|last=|first=|year=2017|website=|publisher=Pennsylvania State Data Center Penn State Harrisburg|accessdate=February 11, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180212004947/https://pasdc.hbg.psu.edu/sdc/pasdc_files/pastats/PAFacts_2017.pdf|archive-date=February 12, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn recent national elections since 1992, Pennsylvania had leaned for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The state voted for the Democratic ticket for president in every election between 1992 and 2012. During the 2008 election campaign, a recruitment drive saw registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by 1.2 million. However, Pennsylvania has a history of electing Republican senators. From 2009 to 2011, the state was represented by two Democratic senators for the first time since 1947. In 2010, Republicans recaptured a U.S. Senate seat as well as a majority of the state's congressional seats, control of both chambers of the state legislature and the governor's mansion. Democrats won back the governor's mansion four years later in the [[Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, 2014|2014 election]]. It was the first time since a governor became eligible to succeed himself that an incumbent governor had been defeated for reelection.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable floatright\" style=\"text-align: right;\" width=\"32%\"\n|+ Voter Registration Totals as of November 5, 2019<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dos.pa.gov/VotingElections/OtherServicesEvents/VotingElectionStatistics/Documents/2019%20Election%20VR%20Stats%20%20final.pdf|title=Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 2019 Voter Registration Statistics\u2014Official November 5, 2019|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of State|access-date=}}</ref>\n|-\n! colspan = 2 | Party\n!

Republican strength was concentrated in the Philadelphia suburbs, as well as the more rural areas in the central, northeastern, and western portions. The latter counties have long been among the most conservative areas in the nation. Since 1992, however, the Philadelphia suburbs have swung Democratic; the brand of Republicanism there was traditionally a moderate one. The Pittsburgh suburbs, historically a Democratic stronghold, have swung more Republican since the turn of the millennium.\n\nDemocratic political consultant [[James Carville]] once pejoratively described Pennsylvania as \"Philadelphia in the east, Pittsburgh in the west and Alabama in the middle\". Political analysts and editorials refer to central Pennsylvania as the \"T\" in statewide elections. Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Scranton/Wilkes-Barre generally vote for Democratic candidates, while the majority of the counties in the central part of the state vote Republican. As a result, maps showing the results of statewide elections invariably form a \"T\" shape.\n\n====Taxation====\n\nPennsylvania has the 10th-highest tax burden in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://taxfoundation.org/state-tax-climate/pennsylvania|title=The facts on Pennsylvania's Tax Climate|publisher=Tax Foundation|accessdate=August 22, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815104910/http://taxfoundation.org/state-tax-climate/pennsylvania|archive-date=August 15, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Residents pay a total of $83.7 billion in state and local taxes with a per capita average of $6,640 annually.

In addition, some local bodies assess a [[income tax|wage tax]] on personal income. Generally, the total wage tax rate is capped at 1% of income but some municipalities with [[home rule]] charters may charge more than 1%. Thirty-two of the Commonwealth's sixty-seven counties levy a [[property tax|personal property tax]] on stocks, bonds, and similar holdings.\n\nWith the exception of the city of [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, municipalities and school districts are allowed to enact a local earned income tax within the purview of Act 32. Residents of these municipalities and school districts are required to file a local income tax return in addition to federal and state returns. This local return is filed with the local income tax collector, a private collection agency (e.g. [[Berkheimer]], [[Keystone Collections]], and [[Jordan Tax Service]]) appointed by a particular county to collect the local earned income and local services tax (the latter a flat fee deducted from salaried employees working within a particular municipality or school district).<ref>{{cite web|title=Local Income Tax Information|url=http://dced.pa.gov/local-government/local-income-tax-information/#.WD8AMuYrJEY|website=PA Department of Community & Economic Development|accessdate=November 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201022801/http://dced.pa.gov/local-government/local-income-tax-information/#.WD8AMuYrJEY|archive-date=December 1, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Berkheimer|url=http://www.hab-inc.com/|website=Berkheimer|accessdate=November 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201015829/http://www.hab-inc.com/|archive-date=December 1, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Keystone Collections Group|url=https://www.keystonecollects.com/|website=Keystone Collections Group|accessdate=November 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024220252/https://www.keystonecollects.com/|archive-date=October 24, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Jordan Tax Service|url=https://www.jordantax.com/|website=Jordan Tax Service|accessdate=November 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206053931/http://www.jordantax.com/|archive-date=December 6, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe City of [[Philadelphia]] has its own local income taxation system. Philadelphia-based employers are required to withhold the Philadelphia wage tax from the salaries of their employees. Residents of Philadelphia working for an employer are not required to file a local return as long as their Philadelphia wage tax is fully withheld by their employer. If their employer does not withhold the Philadelphia wage tax, residents are required to register with the Revenue Department and file an Earnings Tax return.
