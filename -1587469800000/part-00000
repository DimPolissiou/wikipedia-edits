In 1898, Wye became a School of Agriculture within the [[University of London]]. Until 2005, Wye College was a well-known study and research centre in the fields of rural business and management, biological sciences, and the environment and agriculture. The college was officially closed by its then owner, [[Imperial College London]], in September 2009.\n\nToday, buildings that formerly housed Wye College have been repurposed as the Mind Campus in Withersdane Hall,<ref name=\"new campus in Wye\" /><ref name=Wyeweb /> a substance abuse rehabilitation clinic, and Wye School, a school for children of year seven and up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wyeschool.org.uk|title=Wye School > Home|work=wyeschool.org.uk}}</ref> The main campus and several other buildings have been owned by Telareal Trillium since 2015 who are developing a masterplan involving some new housing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.formerwyecollege.co.uk/|title=former wye college|website=www.formerwyecollege.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Wye-college.jpg|thumb|Wye College]]\n\n==Academic and learning centre==\nThe Wye campus developed from 1894 until 2000. It occupies a 3&nbsp;km\u00b2 estate, which includes a farm, managed woodland, and ancient grassland for agroecological research. These resources were augmented by [[Greenhouse|glasshouses]], climate-controlled growth rooms for plants and insects, and a containment facility for [[transgenic plants]] that supported laboratory research. There were dedicated laboratories for plant [[molecular biology]], genomics and gene sequencing, electron microscopy, use of radiochemicals, microbiology, soil analysis, and plant/animal cell culture. Some of these lab facilities were removed by Imperial College. There were student halls and other buildings dotted around the village.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nIn 2000, Wye had students from 50 countries, 477 undergraduates, 259 MSc and PhD students, 200 on short courses, and an External Programme had 975 mid-career professionals registered from 120 different countries.

It has been partly responsible for a huge increase in the number of poker players worldwide. Christiansen Capital Advisors stated online poker revenues grew from $82.7 million in 2001 to $2.4 billion in 2005,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/56438 |title=Going All In For Online Poker |publisher=Newsweek |date=2005-08-15 |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref> while a survey carried out by DrKW and Global Betting and Gaming Consultants asserted online poker revenues in 2004 were at $1.4 billion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto062720050064003754 |title=Financial Times: Online Poker 2004 revenues and 2008 forecast |publisher=Us.ft.com |date=2003-08-28 |accessdate=2009-03-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520074854/http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto062720050064003754 |archivedate=2009-05-20 }}</ref> In a testimony before the [[United States Senate]] regarding Internet Gaming, Grant Eve, a Certified Public Accountant representing the US Accounting Firm [[Joseph Eve, Certified Public Accountants]], estimated that one in every four dollars gambled is gambled online.<ref name=Joseph>{{cite web|last=Eve|first=Grant|title=Grant Eve Testimony 111711 - United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs|url=http://www.indian.senate.gov/hearings/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&pageid=9698|work=The Future of Internet Gaming|accessdate=11 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nTraditional (or \"[[brick and mortar]]\", B&M, live, land-based) venues for playing poker, such as [[casino]]s and poker rooms, may be intimidating for novice players and are often located in geographically disparate locations. Also, brick and mortar casinos are reluctant to promote poker because it is difficult for them to profit from it. Though the [[Rake (poker)|rake]], or time charge, of traditional casinos is often high, the [[opportunity cost]]s of running a poker room are even higher. Brick and mortar casinos often make much more money by removing poker rooms and adding more [[slot machine]]s. For example, figures from the Gaming Accounting Firm [[Joseph Eve, Certified Public Accountants|Joseph Eve]] estimate that poker accounts for 1% of brick and mortar casino revenues.<ref name=Joseph /> [[File:PokerTableOpenSource.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Screenshot of [[open-source]] [[PokerTH]] table]]\n\nOnline venues, by contrast, are dramatically cheaper because they have much smaller overhead costs. For example, adding another table does not take up valuable space like it would for a brick and mortar casino. Online poker rooms also allow the players to play for low stakes (as low as 1\u00a2/2\u00a2) and often offer poker [[Freeroll (poker)|freeroll]] tournaments (where there is no entry fee), attracting beginners and/or less wealthy clientele.\n\nOnline venues may be more vulnerable to certain types of [[fraud]], especially [[collusion]] between players. However, they have collusion detection abilities that do not exist in brick and mortar casinos. For example, online poker room security employees can look at the [[hand history]] of the cards previously played by any player on the site, making patterns of behavior easier to detect than in a casino where colluding players can simply fold their hands without anyone ever knowing the strength of their holding. Online poker rooms also check players' [[IP address]]es in order to prevent players at the same household or at known [[open proxy]] servers from playing on the same tables. Digital [[device fingerprinting]] also allows poker sites to recognize and block players who create new accounts in attempts to circumvent prior account bans, restrictions and closures.\n\n== History ==\nFree poker online was played as early as the late 1990s in the form of [[IRC poker]]. [[Planet Poker]] was the first online card room to offer real money games in 1998. The first real money poker game was dealt on January 1, 1998. Author [[Mike Caro]] became the \"face\" of Planet Poker in October 1999.\n\nThe major online poker sites offer varying features to entice new players. One common feature is to offer tournaments called satellites by which the winners gain entry to real-life poker tournaments. It was through one such tournament on [[PokerStars]] that [[Chris Moneymaker]] won his entry to the [[2003 World Series of Poker]]. He went on to win the main event, causing shock in the poker world, and beginning the [[poker boom]]. The 2004 World Series featured three times as many players as in 2003. At least four players in the WSOP final table won their entry through an online cardroom. Like Moneymaker, 2004 winner [[Greg Raymer]] also won his entry at the [[PokerStars]] online cardroom.\n\nIn October 2004, [[Sportingbet]], at the time the world's largest publicly traded online gaming company (SBT.L), announced the acquisition of [[Sportingbet|ParadisePoker.com]], one of the online poker industry's first and largest cardrooms. The $340 million acquisition marked the first time an online card room was owned by a public company. Since then, several other card room parent companies have gone public.\n\nIn June 2005, [[PartyGaming]], the parent company of the then-largest online cardroom, PartyPoker, went public on the [[London Stock Exchange]], achieving an [[initial public offering]] market value in excess of $8 billion. At the time of the IPO, ninety-two percent of Party Gaming's income came from poker operations.\n\nIn early 2006, PartyGaming moved to acquire EmpirePoker.com from [[Empire Online]]. Later in the year, [[bwin]], an Austrian-based online gambling company, acquired PokerRoom.com. Other poker rooms such as [[PokerStars]] that were rumored to be exploring initial public offerings have postponed them.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2095-2136074,00.html Pokerstars reveals hand with plans for \u00a31bn float] [[The Times]]</ref>\n\nAs of March 2008, there are fewer than forty stand-alone cardrooms and poker networks with detectable levels of traffic.

On the other hand, PokerStars paid $1 billion in fines immediately.\n\nIn 2014, PokerStars became the largest publicly traded company in the industry of poker when businessman David Baazov initiated a takeover bid costing $4.9 billion.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/darrenheitner/2014/06/19/how-a-4-9-billion-purchase-of-pokerstars-could-change-online-poker-in-america/|title=How A $4.9 Billion Purchase Of PokerStars Could Change Online Poker In America|last=Heitner|first=Darren|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-06-11}}</ref>\n\nThe [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] has resulted in a massive increase in online poker traffic. The pandemic is believed to have directed both professional and recreational players who normally prefer live poker to online platforms due the indefinite closure of most casinos and other live gaming venues worldwide, with even many [[Underground poker|unlicensed venues]] shutting down. In addition, the sudden dearth of live entertainment options due to the widespread disruption of the sports and entertainment schedules around the world is believed to have resulted in more than the usual number of casual players turning to online poker as an alternative. Many operators reported traffic of double or more the previous volume, depending on the time of day.\n\n==Legality==\nFrom a legal perspective, online poker may differ in some ways from online casino gambling. However, many of the same issues do apply. For a discussion of the legality of online gambling in general, see [[online gambling]].\n\nOnline poker is legal and regulated in many countries including several nations in and around the [[Caribbean Sea]], and most notably the [[United Kingdom]].\n\n===United States===\nIn the United States, the [[North Dakota]] House of Representatives passed a bill in February 2005 to legalize and regulate online poker and online poker card room operators in the state. The legislation required that online poker operations would have to physically locate their entire operations in the state. Testifying before the state Senate Judiciary committee, Nigel Payne, CEO of Sportingbet and owner of Paradise Poker, pledged to relocate to the state if the bill became law.<ref>{{cite web |first=Tom |last=Rafferty |url=http://www.bismarcktribune.com/articles/2005/03/09/news/topnews/top01.txt |title=Bismarck Tribune |publisher=Bismarck Tribune |date=2005-03-08 |accessdate=2009-03-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060408122500/http://www.bismarcktribune.com/articles/2005/03/09/news/topnews/top01.txt |archivedate=2006-04-08 }}</ref>\n\nThe measure, however, was defeated by the State Senate in March 2005 after the U.S. Department of Justice sent a letter to North Dakota attorney general [[Wayne Stenehjem]] stating that online gaming \"may\" be illegal, and that the pending legislation \"might\" violate the federal [[Federal Wire Act|Wire Act]]. However, many legal experts [[Online gambling#General legal issues|dispute the DOJ's claim]].\n\nIn response to this and other claims by the DOJ regarding the legality of online poker, many of the major online poker sites stopped advertising their \"dot-com\" sites in American media. Instead, they created \"dot-net\" sites that are virtually identical but offer no real money wagering. The sites advertise as poker schools or ways to learn the game for free, and feature words to the effect of \"this is not a gambling website.\"\n\nOn October 13, 2006, [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] officially signed into law the [[SAFE Port Act]], a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] aimed at enhancing security at U.S. ports.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/business/2006/10/13/safe-ports-act-biz-logistics-cx_rm_1013ports.html |title=Bush Signs Safe Port Act |publisher=Forbes |date=2006-10-13 |accessdate=2009-03-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018043515/http://www.forbes.com/business/2006/10/13/safe-ports-act-biz-logistics-cx_rm_1013ports.html|archivedate=2006-10-18}}</ref> Attached to the Safe Port Act was a provision known as the [[Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006]] (UIGEA). According to the UIGEA, \"unlawful internet gambling\" means to place, receive, or otherwise knowingly transmit a bet or wager by means of the internet where such bet is unlawful under any law in the State in which the bet is initiated, received, or otherwise made. Thus, the UIGEA prohibits online gambling sites from performing transactions with American financial institutions. As a result of the bill, several large publicly traded poker gaming sites such as [[PartyPoker]], [[Cassava Enterprises|PacificPoker]] and [[bwin]] closed down their US-facing operations. The UIGEA has had a devastating effect on the stock value of these companies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whichpoker.com/stats/UIGEAEffects |title=UIGEA Safe Port Act Legislation effect on Online Poker Rooms |publisher=WhichPoker |accessdate=2009-03-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227075802/http://www.whichpoker.com/stats/UIGEAEffects |archivedate=2009-02-27 }}</ref> Some poker sites, such as [[PokerStars]], [[Full Tilt Poker]], [[Absolute Poker]], continued to operate and remained open to US players.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cardplayer.com/poker-news/1487-pokerstars-will-keep-serving-american-customers |title=PokerStars Will Keep Serving American Customers |publisher=CardPlayer |date=2006-10-12 |accessdate=2013-07-23}}</ref>\n\nFollowing passage of UIGEA, former U.S. Senator [[Al D'Amato]] joined the [[Poker Players Alliance]] (PPA).

The move blocks regulations to implement the legislation which requires the financial services sector to comply with ambiguous and burdensome rules in an attempt to prevent unlawful Internet gambling transactions.\n\nOn July 28, 2010, the [[House Financial Services Committee]] passed H.R. 2267 by a vote of 41\u201322\u20131.

First, there is the [[rake (poker)|rake]]. Similar to the [[Vigorish|vig]] paid to a [[Bookmaker|bookie]], the rake is a fee paid to the [[Casino|house]] for hosting the game. Rake is collected from most real money [[Cash game|ring game]] pots. The rake is normally calculated as a percentage of the pot based on a sliding scale and capped at some maximum fee. Each online poker room determines its own rake structure. Since the expenses for running an online poker table are smaller than those for running a live poker table, rake in most online poker rooms is much smaller than its brick and mortar counterpart.\n\nSecond, hands played in pre-scheduled multi-table and impromptu [[sit and go|sit-and-go]] [[poker tournament|tournaments]] are not raked, but rather an entry fee around five to ten percent of the tournament buy-in is added to the entry cost of the tournament. These two are usually specified in the tournament details as, e.g., $20+$2 ($20 represents the buy-in that goes into the prize pool and $2 represents the entry fee, de facto rake). Unlike real casino tournaments, online tournaments do not deduct dealer tips and other expenses from the prize pool.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thedailypoker.com/online-poker/how-online-poker-rooms-profit/ | title=How online poker rooms profit? | publisher=The Daily Poker |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205065713/http://www.thedailypoker.com/online-poker/how-online-poker-rooms-profit/|archive-date=2008-12-05 |access-date=2017-02-13 }}</ref>\n\nThird, some online poker sites also offer side games like [[blackjack]], [[roulettes]], or side bets on poker hands where the player plays against \"the house\" for real money.<ref>{{cite web|title=Side Games|url=http://www.mergegaming.com/side-games.html|publisher=Merge Gaming|accessdate=8 April 2014}}</ref> The odds are in the house's favor in these games, thus producing a profit for the house. Some sites go as far as getting affiliated with [[online casino]]s, or even integrating them into the poker room software.\n\nFourth, like almost all institutions that hold money, online poker sites invest the money that players deposit. Regulations in most jurisdictions exist in an effort to limit the sort of risks sites can take with their clients' money. However, since the sites do not have to pay interest on players' bankrolls even low-risk investments can be a significant source of revenue.\n\n==Integrity and fairness==\n===Randomness of the shuffle===\nMany critics question whether the operators of such games - especially those located in jurisdictions separate from most of their players - might be engaging in fraud themselves.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pokernews.com/news/2013/11/todd-witteles-discusses-poker-fraud-alert-cheating-more-16878.htm | title=Todd \"DanDruff\" Witteles Discusses PokerFraudAlert, Cheating in Poker & Much More | publisher=Pokernews | date=26 November 2013 | accessdate=29 March 2014 | author=Holloway, Chad}}</ref>\n\nInternet discussion forums are rife with allegations of non-random card dealing, possibly to favour house-employed players or \"[[computer game bot|bot]]s\" (poker-playing software disguised as a human opponent), or to give multiple players good hands thus increasing the bets and the rake, or simply to prevent new players from losing so quickly that they become discouraged. However, despite [[anecdotal evidence]] to support such claims, others argue that the rake is sufficiently large that such abuses would be unnecessary and foolish. Attempts at manipulative dealing could face a risk of third party detection due to increasingly sophisticated tracking software that could be used to detect any number of unusual patterns, though such analyses are not generally available in the public domain.\n\nMany players claim to see lots of \"bad beats\" with large hands pitted against others all too often at a rate that seems to be a lot more common than in live games. However, this could be caused by the higher hands per hour at on-line cardrooms. Since online players get to see more hands, their likelihood of seeing more improbable bad beats or randomly large pots is similarly increased.\n\nMany online poker sites are certified by major auditing firms like [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] to review the fairness of the [[random number generator]], [[shuffle]], and payouts for some sites.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ENMVgzDt1MEC&pg=PA23|title=Winning at Internet Poker For Dummies|last=Harlan|first=Mark|last2=Derossi|first2=Chris|date=2011-04-27|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=|isbn=9781118070000|location=|pages=23|language=en|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Insider cheating===\nInsider [[cheating]] can occur when a person with trusted access to the system (e.g. an employee of the poker room) uses his position to play poker himself with an unfair advantage. This could be done without the knowledge of the site managers.\n\nPerhaps the first known major case came to light in October 2007, when [[Absolute Poker]] acknowledged that its integrity had been breached by an employee, who had been able to play at high stakes while viewing his opponents' hidden \"hole\" cards.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21381022 |title=Online poker cheating blamed on employee |publisher=NBC News |date=2007-10-19 |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref> The cheating was first brought to light by the efforts of players, whose saved histories of play showed the employee was playing as only someone who could see their opponents' cards could.<ref>{{cite web|last=Levitt |first=Steven D. |url=http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/20/how-not-to-cheat/ |title=How Not to Cheat - Freakonomics Blog - NYTimes.com |publisher=Freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2007-09-20 |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, [[UltimateBet]] became embroiled in a similar scandal, with former employees accused of using a [[backdoor (computing)|software backdoor]] to see opponents' cards. UltimateBet confirmed the allegations on May 29.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/26563848 |title=Poker site cheating plot a high-stakes whodunit |publisher=NBC News |date=2008-09-18 |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref> The [[Kahnawake Gaming Commission]] announced sanctions against UltimateBet as a result.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokernews.com/news/2008/09/kahnawake-announces-ultimate-bet-sanctions.htm |title=Kahnawake Gaming Commission Announces Sanctions on UltimateBet: Russ Hamilton Named |publisher=Pokernews.com |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref>\n\n===Collusion===\nMore mundane cheating involves collusion between players, or the use of multiple accounts by a single player. Collusion is not limited to online play but can occur in any poker game with three or more players. Most poker rooms claim to actively scan for such activity. For example, in 2007, [[PokerStars]] disqualified [[TheV0id]], the winner of the main event of the [[World Championship of Online Poker]] for breaching their terms of service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cardplayer.com/poker-news/2892-poker-stars-wcoop-main-event-winner-disqualified|title=Card Player Magazine |publisher=Cardplayer.com |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref>\n\n==Differences compared with conventional poker==\nThere are substantial differences between online poker gaming and conventional, live gaming.\n\nOne obvious difference is that players do not sit right across from each other, removing any ability to observe others' reactions and [[body language]]. Instead, online poker players learn to focus more keenly on opponents' betting patterns, reaction time, speed of play, use of check boxes/auto plays, opponents' fold/flop percentages, chat box, waiting for the big blind, beginners' tells, and other behavior [[Tell (poker)|tells]] that are not physical in nature. Since poker is a game that requires adaptability, successful online players learn to master the new frontiers of their surroundings.\n\nAnother less obvious difference is the rate of play. In brick and mortar casinos the dealer has to collect the cards, shuffle, and deal them after every hand. Due to this and other delays common in offline casinos, the average rate of play is around thirty hands per hour. However, online casinos do not have these delays. The dealing and shuffling are instantaneous, there are no delays relating to counting chips (for a split pot), and on average the play is faster due to \"auto-action\" buttons (where the player selects his action before his turn). It is not uncommon for an online poker table to average ninety to one hundred hands per hour.\n\nThere are many ways in which online poker is considerably cheaper to play than conventional poker. While the rake structures of online poker sites might not differ fundamentally from those in brick and mortar operations, most of the other incidental expenses that are entailed by playing poker in a live room do not exist in online poker. An online poker player can play at home and thus incur no transportation costs to get to and from the poker room. Provided the player already has a somewhat modern computer and an Internet connection, there are no further up-front equipment costs to get started. There are also considerable incidental expenses once on a live poker table. In addition to the rake, [[gratuity|tipping]] the dealers, chip runners, servers and other casino employees is almost universally expected, putting a further drain on a player's profits. Also, whereas an online player can enter and leave tables almost as he pleases, once seated at a live table a player must remain there until he wishes to stop playing, or else go back to the bottom of the waiting list. [[Food]] and [[beverage]]s at casinos are generally expensive even compared to other hospitality establishments in the same city, let alone compared to at home, and casino managers feel little incentive to provide any complimentary food or drink for poker players.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nIn the brick and mortar casinos, the only real way a player can increase his earnings is to increase his limit, likely encountering better opponents in the process. In the online world, players have another option: play more tables. Unlike a traditional casino where it is physically impossible to play at more than one table at a time, most online poker rooms permit this. Depending on the site and the player's ability to make speedy decisions, a player might play several tables at the same time, viewing them each in a separate window on the computer display. For example, an average profit around $10 per 100 hands at a low-limit game is generally considered to be good play. In a casino, this would earn a player under $4 an hour. After dealer tips, the \"winning\" player would probably barely break even before any other incidental expenses. In an online poker room, a player with the same win rate playing a relatively easy pace of four tables at once at a relatively sluggish 60 hands per hour each earns about $24/hour on average. The main restriction limiting the number of tables a player can play is the need to make consistently good decisions within the allotted time at every table, but some online players can effectively play up to eight or more tables at once. This can not only increase winnings but can also help to keep a player's income reasonably stable, since instead of staking his entire bankroll on one higher limit table he is splitting his bankroll, wins and losses amongst many lower limit tables, probably also encountering somewhat less skilled opponents in the process.\n\nAnother important difference results from the fact that some online poker rooms offer online poker schools that teach the basics and significantly speed up the learning curve for novices. Many online poker rooms also provide free money play so that players may practice these skills in various poker games and limits without the risk of losing real money, and generally offer the hand history of played hands for analysis and discussion using a [[Poker tools|poker hand converter]]. People who previously had no way to learn and improve because they had no one to play with now have the ability to learn the game much quicker and gain experience from free-money play.\n\nThe limits associated with online poker range down to far lower levels than the [[table limit]]s at a traditional casino. The [[marginal cost]] of opening each online table is so minuscule that on some gambling sites players can find limits as low as $.01\u2013$.02. By comparison, at most brick and mortar establishments the lowest limits are often $1\u2013$2.\n\nFew (if any) online poker sites allow action to be taken \"in the [[Poker terms#D|dark]]\", while this is usually allowed and applied by players in real gaming houses. It is also not uncommon for online poker sites to not allow a player the option of showing their hand before folding if they are the giving up the pot to the last remaining bettor. This practice is also typically allowed in casinos.\n\n===Currency issues===\nOne issue exclusive to online poker is the fact that players come from around the world and deal in a variety of currencies. This is not an issue in live poker where everyone present can be expected to carry the local currency. Most online poker sites operate games exclusively in [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]], even if they do not accept players based in the United States. There are two methods by which poker sites can cater to players who do not deal with U.S. dollars on a regular basis.\n\nThe first method is to hold players' funds in their native currencies and convert them only when players enter and leave games. The main benefit of this method for players is to ensure that bankrolls are not subject to [[exchange rate]] fluctuations against their local currencies while they are not playing. Also, most sites that use this method usually apply the same exchange rate when a player cashes out of a game as when he bought in, ensuring that players do not expend significant sums simply by entering and leaving games.\n\nThe other method is to require players to convert their funds when depositing them. However, some sites that use this policy do accept payments in a variety of currencies and convert funds at a lower premium compared to what [[bank]]s and [[credit card]] companies would charge. Others only accept payment in U.S. dollars. One benefit of this method is that a player who constantly \"tops up\" his chip stack to a constant level (some poker rooms have an optional feature that can perform this function automatically) does not have to worry about rounding issues when topping up with a nominal sum \u2013 these could add up over time.\n\nPlayers may also make use of [[Digital wallet|ewallets]], virtual wallets that will allow players to store their funds online in the currency of their choice. This allows them to deposit at poker sites without worrying about further currency conversion.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pokerfuse.com/features/comment-analysis/ach-and-ewallets-provide-deposit-solutions-for-online-gaming-sites-in-new-jersey-05-12/ | title=ACH and eWallets Provide Deposit Solutions for Online Gaming Sites in New Jersey | publisher=Pokerfuse | date=5 December 2013 | accessdate=29 March 2014 | author=Gentile, Michael}}</ref>\n\nMany online poker sites, particularly those that serve the United States, began adopting [[cryptocurrencies]] in 2013 as a means of bypassing the [[UIGEA]]. The majority of these poker rooms accept deposits in [[Bitcoin]] and then convert them to U.S. dollars, performing this process in reverse when paying out winnings. There also exist cryptocurrency-only operators who denominate their games in Bitcoin or fractions of a bitcoin, avoiding [[fiat currencies]] entirely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://professionalrakeback.com/bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-provide-payment-processing-solutions-for-online-gaming-sites|title=Cryptocurrencies Provide New Processing Channels for Online Gambling Operators|author=Singh, Michael|publisher=ProfessionalRakeback|date=29 January 2017|accessdate=5 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Poker tools===\n{{main|Poker tools}}\nVarious types of useful [[poker tools|software applications]] are available for online play. Such tools include hand database programs that save, sort, and recall all hand histories played online. Scanning the active tables for known players and displaying previous statistics from hands with those players next to their name(known as a Heads up display or HUD) is a common feature of these programs and is allowed by most sites. Other programs include hand re-players and odds, equity or variance calculators. Some software goes as far as to provide you with quizzes, or scan your previously played hands and flag likely mistakes.\n\n==Bonuses==\nMany online poker sites offer incentives to players, especially new depositors, in the form of bonuses. Usually, the bonuses are paid out incrementally as certain amounts are raked by the player. For example, a site may offer a player who deposits $100 a bonus of $50 that awards $5 every time the player rakes $25. To earn the full $50 bonus sum, the player would have to [[Rake (poker)|rake]] $250 in total.\n\nIn addition, several online cardrooms have developed VIP programs to reward regular players. Poker rooms often offer additional bonuses for players who wish to top-up their accounts. These are known as reload bonuses.\n\nMany online rooms also offer [[rakeback]] and some offer poker propping.\n\nSee the [[Online casino#Bonuses|online casino]] article for more on general information on bonuses.\n\n== Compatibility ==\nOnline poker rooms typically operate through a separate piece of software. This may be cross-platform, for example using a [[Java applet]] or [[WebGL]], allowing the program to run equally well on various computer systems such as [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]] and [[macOS]]. However, many online poker rooms offer downloadable programs designed only for Microsoft Windows which require a compatibility layer such as [[Wine (software)|Wine]] to run on [[Macintosh]] or [[Linux]] computers. Some sites do make available clients that run natively on Mac or Linux.\n\nSome poker rooms have started offering poker on portable devices ([[mobile phone]]s, [[smart phone]]s, [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s). The functionality of mobile online poker software is much the same as computer-based clients, albeit adapted to the interface of mobile devices. The player must be able to receive a WiFi or cell phone signal in order to play.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Computer poker players]]\n*[[:Category:Poker companies|Poker companies]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n<!--========================({{No More Links}})============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

It has been partly responsible for a huge increase in the number of poker players worldwide. Christiansen Capital Advisors stated online poker revenues grew from $82.7 million in 2001 to $2.4 billion in 2005,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/56438 |title=Going All In For Online Poker |publisher=Newsweek |date=2005-08-15 |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref> while a survey carried out by DrKW and Global Betting and Gaming Consultants asserted online poker revenues in 2004 were at $1.4 billion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto062720050064003754 |title=Financial Times: Online Poker 2004 revenues and 2008 forecast |publisher=Us.ft.com |date=2003-08-28 |accessdate=2009-03-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520074854/http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto062720050064003754 |archivedate=2009-05-20 }}</ref> In a testimony before the [[United States Senate]] regarding Internet Gaming, Grant Eve, a Certified Public Accountant representing the US Accounting Firm [[Joseph Eve, Certified Public Accountants]], estimated that one in every four dollars gambled is gambled online.<ref name=Joseph>{{cite web|last=Eve|first=Grant|title=Grant Eve Testimony 111711 - United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs|url=http://www.indian.senate.gov/hearings/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&pageid=9698|work=The Future of Internet Gaming|accessdate=11 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nTraditional (or \"[[brick and mortar]]\", B&M, live, land-based) venues for playing poker, such as [[casino]]s and poker rooms, may be intimidating for novice players and are often located in geographically disparate locations. Also, brick and mortar casinos are reluctant to promote poker because it is difficult for them to profit from it. Though the [[Rake (poker)|rake]], or time charge, of traditional casinos is often high, the [[opportunity cost]]s of running a poker room are even higher. Brick and mortar casinos often make much more money by removing poker rooms and adding more [[slot machine]]s. For example, figures from the Gaming Accounting Firm [[Joseph Eve, Certified Public Accountants|Joseph Eve]] estimate that poker accounts for 1% of brick and mortar casino revenues.<ref name=Joseph /> [[File:PokerTableOpenSource.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Screenshot of [[open-source]] [[PokerTH]] table]]\n\nOnline venues, by contrast, are dramatically cheaper because they have much smaller overhead costs. For example, adding another table does not take up valuable space like it would for a brick and mortar casino. Online poker rooms also allow the players to play for low stakes (as low as 1\u00a2/2\u00a2) and often offer poker [[Freeroll (poker)|freeroll]] tournaments (where there is no entry fee), attracting beginners and/or less wealthy clientele.\n\nOnline venues may be more vulnerable to certain types of [[fraud]], especially [[collusion]] between players. However, they have collusion detection abilities that do not exist in brick and mortar casinos. For example, online poker room security employees can look at the [[hand history]] of the cards previously played by any player on the site, making patterns of behavior easier to detect than in a casino where colluding players can simply fold their hands without anyone ever knowing the strength of their holding. Online poker rooms also check players' [[IP address]]es in order to prevent players at the same household or at known [[open proxy]] servers from playing on the same tables. Digital [[device fingerprinting]] also allows poker sites to recognize and block players who create new accounts in attempts to circumvent prior account bans, restrictions and closures.\n\n== History ==\nFree poker online was played as early as the late 1990s in the form of [[IRC poker]]. [[Planet Poker]] was the first online card room to offer real money games in 1998. The first real money poker game was dealt on January 1, 1998. Author [[Mike Caro]] became the \"face\" of Planet Poker in October 1999.\n\nThe major online poker sites offer varying features to entice new players. One common feature is to offer tournaments called satellites by which the winners gain entry to real-life poker tournaments. It was through one such tournament on [[PokerStars]] that [[Chris Moneymaker]] won his entry to the [[2003 World Series of Poker]]. He went on to win the main event, causing shock in the poker world, and beginning the [[poker boom]]. The 2004 World Series featured three times as many players as in 2003. At least four players in the WSOP final table won their entry through an online cardroom. Like Moneymaker, 2004 winner [[Greg Raymer]] also won his entry at the [[PokerStars]] online cardroom.\n\nIn October 2004, [[Sportingbet]], at the time the world's largest publicly traded online gaming company (SBT.L), announced the acquisition of [[Sportingbet|ParadisePoker.com]], one of the online poker industry's first and largest cardrooms. The $340 million acquisition marked the first time an online card room was owned by a public company. Since then, several other card room parent companies have gone public.\n\nIn June 2005, [[PartyGaming]], the parent company of the then-largest online cardroom, PartyPoker, went public on the [[London Stock Exchange]], achieving an [[initial public offering]] market value in excess of $8 billion. At the time of the IPO, ninety-two percent of Party Gaming's income came from poker operations.\n\nIn early 2006, PartyGaming moved to acquire EmpirePoker.com from [[Empire Online]].

The pandemic is believed to have directed both professional and recreational players who normally prefer live poker to online platforms due the indefinite closure of most casinos and other live gaming venues worldwide, with even many [[Underground poker|unlicensed venues]] shutting down. In addition, the sudden dearth of live entertainment options due to the widespread disruption of the sports and entertainment schedules around the world is believed to have resulted in more than the usual number of casual players turning to online poker as an alternative. Many operators reported traffic of double or more the previous volume, depending on the time of day.\n\n==Legality==\nFrom a legal perspective, online poker may differ in some ways from online casino gambling. However, many of the same issues do apply. For a discussion of the legality of online gambling in general, see [[online gambling]].\n\nOnline poker is legal and regulated in many countries including several nations in and around the [[Caribbean Sea]], and most notably the [[United Kingdom]].\n\n===United States===\nIn the United States, the [[North Dakota]] House of Representatives passed a bill in February 2005 to legalize and regulate online poker and online poker card room operators in the state. The legislation required that online poker operations would have to physically locate their entire operations in the state. Testifying before the state Senate Judiciary committee, Nigel Payne, CEO of Sportingbet and owner of Paradise Poker, pledged to relocate to the state if the bill became law.<ref>{{cite web |first=Tom |last=Rafferty |url=http://www.bismarcktribune.com/articles/2005/03/09/news/topnews/top01.txt |title=Bismarck Tribune |publisher=Bismarck Tribune |date=2005-03-08 |accessdate=2009-03-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060408122500/http://www.bismarcktribune.com/articles/2005/03/09/news/topnews/top01.txt |archivedate=2006-04-08 }}</ref>\n\nThe measure, however, was defeated by the State Senate in March 2005 after the U.S. Department of Justice sent a letter to North Dakota attorney general [[Wayne Stenehjem]] stating that online gaming \"may\" be illegal, and that the pending legislation \"might\" violate the federal [[Federal Wire Act|Wire Act]]. However, many legal experts [[Online gambling#General legal issues|dispute the DOJ's claim]].\n\nIn response to this and other claims by the DOJ regarding the legality of online poker, many of the major online poker sites stopped advertising their \"dot-com\" sites in American media. Instead, they created \"dot-net\" sites that are virtually identical but offer no real money wagering. The sites advertise as poker schools or ways to learn the game for free, and feature words to the effect of \"this is not a gambling website.\"\n\nOn October 13, 2006, [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] officially signed into law the [[SAFE Port Act]], a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] aimed at enhancing security at U.S. ports.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/business/2006/10/13/safe-ports-act-biz-logistics-cx_rm_1013ports.html |title=Bush Signs Safe Port Act |publisher=Forbes |date=2006-10-13 |accessdate=2009-03-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018043515/http://www.forbes.com/business/2006/10/13/safe-ports-act-biz-logistics-cx_rm_1013ports.html|archivedate=2006-10-18}}</ref> Attached to the Safe Port Act was a provision known as the [[Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006]] (UIGEA). According to the UIGEA, \"unlawful internet gambling\" means to place, receive, or otherwise knowingly transmit a bet or wager by means of the internet where such bet is unlawful under any law in the State in which the bet is initiated, received, or otherwise made. Thus, the UIGEA prohibits online gambling sites from performing transactions with American financial institutions. As a result of the bill, several large publicly traded poker gaming sites such as [[PartyPoker]], [[Cassava Enterprises|PacificPoker]] and [[bwin]] closed down their US-facing operations.

First, there is the [[rake (poker)|rake]]. Similar to the [[Vigorish|vig]] paid to a [[Bookmaker|bookie]], the rake is a fee paid to the [[Casino|house]] for hosting the game. Rake is collected from most real money [[Cash game|ring game]] pots. The rake is normally calculated as a percentage of the pot based on a sliding scale and capped at some maximum fee. Each online poker room determines its own rake structure. Since the expenses for running an online poker table are smaller than those for running a live poker table, rake in most online poker rooms is much smaller than its brick and mortar counterpart.\n\nSecond, hands played in pre-scheduled multi-table and impromptu [[sit and go|sit-and-go]] [[poker tournament|tournaments]] are not raked, but rather an entry fee around five to ten percent of the tournament buy-in is added to the entry cost of the tournament. These two are usually specified in the tournament details as, e.g., $20+$2 ($20 represents the buy-in that goes into the prize pool and $2 represents the entry fee, de facto rake). Unlike real casino tournaments, online tournaments do not deduct dealer tips and other expenses from the prize pool.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thedailypoker.com/online-poker/how-online-poker-rooms-profit/ | title=How online poker rooms profit? | publisher=The Daily Poker |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205065713/http://www.thedailypoker.com/online-poker/how-online-poker-rooms-profit/|archive-date=2008-12-05 |access-date=2017-02-13 }}</ref>\n\nThird, some online poker sites also offer side games like [[blackjack]], [[roulettes]], or side bets on poker hands where the player plays against \"the house\" for real money.<ref>{{cite web|title=Side Games|url=http://www.mergegaming.com/side-games.html|publisher=Merge Gaming|accessdate=8 April 2014}}</ref> The odds are in the house's favor in these games, thus producing a profit for the house. Some sites go as far as getting affiliated with [[online casino]]s, or even integrating them into the poker room software.\n\nFourth, like almost all institutions that hold money, online poker sites invest the money that players deposit. Regulations in most jurisdictions exist in an effort to limit the sort of risks sites can take with their clients' money. However, since the sites do not have to pay interest on players' bankrolls even low-risk investments can be a significant source of revenue.\n\n==Integrity and fairness==\n===Randomness of the shuffle===\nMany critics question whether the operators of such games - especially those located in jurisdictions separate from most of their players - might be engaging in fraud themselves.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pokernews.com/news/2013/11/todd-witteles-discusses-poker-fraud-alert-cheating-more-16878.htm | title=Todd \"DanDruff\" Witteles Discusses PokerFraudAlert, Cheating in Poker & Much More | publisher=Pokernews | date=26 November 2013 | accessdate=29 March 2014 | author=Holloway, Chad}}</ref>\n\nInternet discussion forums are rife with allegations of non-random card dealing, possibly to favour house-employed players or \"[[computer game bot|bot]]s\" (poker-playing software disguised as a human opponent), or to give multiple players good hands thus increasing the bets and the rake, or simply to prevent new players from losing so quickly that they become discouraged. However, despite [[anecdotal evidence]] to support such claims, others argue that the rake is sufficiently large that such abuses would be unnecessary and foolish. Attempts at manipulative dealing could face a risk of third party detection due to increasingly sophisticated tracking software that could be used to detect any number of unusual patterns, though such analyses are not generally available in the public domain.\n\nMany players claim to see lots of \"bad beats\" with large hands pitted against others all too often at a rate that seems to be a lot more common than in live games. However, this could be caused by the higher hands per hour at on-line cardrooms. Since online players get to see more hands, their likelihood of seeing more improbable bad beats or randomly large pots is similarly increased.\n\nMany online poker sites are certified by major auditing firms like [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] to review the fairness of the [[random number generator]], [[shuffle]], and payouts for some sites.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ENMVgzDt1MEC&pg=PA23|title=Winning at Internet Poker For Dummies|last=Harlan|first=Mark|last2=Derossi|first2=Chris|date=2011-04-27|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=|isbn=9781118070000|location=|pages=23|language=en|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Insider cheating===\nInsider [[cheating]] can occur when a person with trusted access to the system (e.g. an employee of the poker room) uses his position to play poker himself with an unfair advantage. This could be done without the knowledge of the site managers.\n\nPerhaps the first known major case came to light in October 2007, when [[Absolute Poker]] acknowledged that its integrity had been breached by an employee, who had been able to play at high stakes while viewing his opponents' hidden \"hole\" cards.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21381022 |title=Online poker cheating blamed on employee |publisher=NBC News |date=2007-10-19 |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref> The cheating was first brought to light by the efforts of players, whose saved histories of play showed the employee was playing as only someone who could see their opponents' cards could.<ref>{{cite web|last=Levitt |first=Steven D. |url=http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/20/how-not-to-cheat/ |title=How Not to Cheat - Freakonomics Blog - NYTimes.com |publisher=Freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2007-09-20 |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, [[UltimateBet]] became embroiled in a similar scandal, with former employees accused of using a [[backdoor (computing)|software backdoor]] to see opponents' cards. UltimateBet confirmed the allegations on May 29.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/26563848 |title=Poker site cheating plot a high-stakes whodunit |publisher=NBC News |date=2008-09-18 |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref> The [[Kahnawake Gaming Commission]] announced sanctions against UltimateBet as a result.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokernews.com/news/2008/09/kahnawake-announces-ultimate-bet-sanctions.htm |title=Kahnawake Gaming Commission Announces Sanctions on UltimateBet: Russ Hamilton Named |publisher=Pokernews.com |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref>\n\n===Collusion===\nMore mundane cheating involves collusion between players, or the use of multiple accounts by a single player. Collusion is not limited to online play but can occur in any poker game with three or more players. Most poker rooms claim to actively scan for such activity. For example, in 2007, [[PokerStars]] disqualified [[TheV0id]], the winner of the main event of the [[World Championship of Online Poker]] for breaching their terms of service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cardplayer.com/poker-news/2892-poker-stars-wcoop-main-event-winner-disqualified|title=Card Player Magazine |publisher=Cardplayer.com |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref>\n\n==Differences compared with conventional poker==\nThere are substantial differences between online poker gaming and conventional, live gaming.\n\nOne obvious difference is that players do not sit right across from each other, removing any ability to observe others' reactions and [[body language]]. Instead, online poker players learn to focus more keenly on opponents' betting patterns, reaction time, speed of play, use of check boxes/auto plays, opponents' fold/flop percentages, chat box, waiting for the big blind, beginners' tells, and other behavior [[Tell (poker)|tells]] that are not physical in nature. Since poker is a game that requires adaptability, successful online players learn to master the new frontiers of their surroundings.\n\nAnother less obvious difference is the rate of play. In brick and mortar casinos the dealer has to collect the cards, shuffle, and deal them after every hand. Due to this and other delays common in offline casinos, the average rate of play is around thirty hands per hour. However, online casinos do not have these delays. The dealing and shuffling are instantaneous, there are no delays relating to counting chips (for a split pot), and on average the play is faster due to \"auto-action\" buttons (where the player selects his action before his turn). It is not uncommon for an online poker table to average ninety to one hundred hands per hour.\n\nThere are many ways in which online poker is considerably cheaper to play than conventional poker. While the rake structures of online poker sites might not differ fundamentally from those in brick and mortar operations, most of the other incidental expenses that are entailed by playing poker in a live room do not exist in online poker. An online poker player can play at home and thus incur no transportation costs to get to and from the poker room. Provided the player already has a somewhat modern computer and an Internet connection, there are no further up-front equipment costs to get started. There are also considerable incidental expenses once on a live poker table. In addition to the rake, [[gratuity|tipping]] the dealers, chip runners, servers and other casino employees is almost universally expected, putting a further drain on a player's profits. Also, whereas an online player can enter and leave tables almost as he pleases, once seated at a live table a player must remain there until he wishes to stop playing, or else go back to the bottom of the waiting list. [[Food]] and [[beverage]]s at casinos are generally expensive even compared to other hospitality establishments in the same city, let alone compared to at home, and casino managers feel little incentive to provide any complimentary food or drink for poker players.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nIn the brick and mortar casinos, the only real way a player can increase his earnings is to increase his limit, likely encountering better opponents in the process. In the online world, players have another option: play more tables. Unlike a traditional casino where it is physically impossible to play at more than one table at a time, most online poker rooms permit this. Depending on the site and the player's ability to make speedy decisions, a player might play several tables at the same time, viewing them each in a separate window on the computer display. For example, an average profit around $10 per 100 hands at a low-limit game is generally considered to be good play. In a casino, this would earn a player under $4 an hour. After dealer tips, the \"winning\" player would probably barely break even before any other incidental expenses. In an online poker room, a player with the same win rate playing a relatively easy pace of four tables at once at a relatively sluggish 60 hands per hour each earns about $24/hour on average. The main restriction limiting the number of tables a player can play is the need to make consistently good decisions within the allotted time at every table, but some online players can effectively play up to eight or more tables at once. This can not only increase winnings but can also help to keep a player's income reasonably stable, since instead of staking his entire bankroll on one higher limit table he is splitting his bankroll, wins and losses amongst many lower limit tables, probably also encountering somewhat less skilled opponents in the process.\n\nAnother important difference results from the fact that some online poker rooms offer online poker schools that teach the basics and significantly speed up the learning curve for novices. Many online poker rooms also provide free money play so that players may practice these skills in various poker games and limits without the risk of losing real money, and generally offer the hand history of played hands for analysis and discussion using a [[Poker tools|poker hand converter]]. People who previously had no way to learn and improve because they had no one to play with now have the ability to learn the game much quicker and gain experience from free-money play.\n\nThe limits associated with online poker range down to far lower levels than the [[table limit]]s at a traditional casino. The [[marginal cost]] of opening each online table is so minuscule that on some gambling sites players can find limits as low as $.01\u2013$.02. By comparison, at most brick and mortar establishments the lowest limits are often $1\u2013$2.\n\nFew (if any) online poker sites allow action to be taken \"in the [[Poker terms#D|dark]]\", while this is usually allowed and applied by players in real gaming houses. It is also not uncommon for online poker sites to not allow a player the option of showing their hand before folding if they are the giving up the pot to the last remaining bettor. This practice is also typically allowed in casinos.\n\n===Currency issues===\nOne issue exclusive to online poker is the fact that players come from around the world and deal in a variety of currencies. This is not an issue in live poker where everyone present can be expected to carry the local currency. Most online poker sites operate games exclusively in [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]], even if they do not accept players based in the United States. There are two methods by which poker sites can cater to players who do not deal with U.S. dollars on a regular basis.\n\nThe first method is to hold players' funds in their native currencies and convert them only when players enter and leave games. The main benefit of this method for players is to ensure that bankrolls are not subject to [[exchange rate]] fluctuations against their local currencies while they are not playing. Also, most sites that use this method usually apply the same exchange rate when a player cashes out of a game as when he bought in, ensuring that players do not expend significant sums simply by entering and leaving games.\n\nThe other method is to require players to convert their funds when depositing them. However, some sites that use this policy do accept payments in a variety of currencies and convert funds at a lower premium compared to what [[bank]]s and [[credit card]] companies would charge. Others only accept payment in U.S. dollars. One benefit of this method is that a player who constantly \"tops up\" his chip stack to a constant level (some poker rooms have an optional feature that can perform this function automatically) does not have to worry about rounding issues when topping up with a nominal sum \u2013 these could add up over time.\n\nPlayers may also make use of [[Digital wallet|ewallets]], virtual wallets that will allow players to store their funds online in the currency of their choice. This allows them to deposit at poker sites without worrying about further currency conversion.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pokerfuse.com/features/comment-analysis/ach-and-ewallets-provide-deposit-solutions-for-online-gaming-sites-in-new-jersey-05-12/ | title=ACH and eWallets Provide Deposit Solutions for Online Gaming Sites in New Jersey | publisher=Pokerfuse | date=5 December 2013 | accessdate=29 March 2014 | author=Gentile, Michael}}</ref>\n\nMany online poker sites, particularly those that serve the United States, began adopting [[cryptocurrencies]] in 2013 as a means of bypassing the [[UIGEA]]. The majority of these poker rooms accept deposits in [[Bitcoin]] and then convert them to U.S. dollars, performing this process in reverse when paying out winnings. There also exist cryptocurrency-only operators who denominate their games in Bitcoin or fractions of a bitcoin, avoiding [[fiat currencies]] entirely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://professionalrakeback.com/bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-provide-payment-processing-solutions-for-online-gaming-sites|title=Cryptocurrencies Provide New Processing Channels for Online Gambling Operators|author=Singh, Michael|publisher=ProfessionalRakeback|date=29 January 2017|accessdate=5 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Poker tools===\n{{main|Poker tools}}\nVarious types of useful [[poker tools|software applications]] are available for online play. Such tools include hand database programs that save, sort, and recall all hand histories played online. Scanning the active tables for known players and displaying previous statistics from hands with those players next to their name(known as a Heads up display or HUD) is a common feature of these programs and is allowed by most sites. Other programs include hand re-players and odds, equity or variance calculators. Some software goes as far as to provide you with quizzes, or scan your previously played hands and flag likely mistakes.\n\n==Bonuses==\nMany online poker sites offer incentives to players, especially new depositors, in the form of bonuses. Usually, the bonuses are paid out incrementally as certain amounts are raked by the player. For example, a site may offer a player who deposits $100 a bonus of $50 that awards $5 every time the player rakes $25. To earn the full $50 bonus sum, the player would have to [[Rake (poker)|rake]] $250 in total.\n\nIn addition, several online cardrooms have developed VIP programs to reward regular players. Poker rooms often offer additional bonuses for players who wish to top-up their accounts. These are known as reload bonuses.\n\nMany online rooms also offer [[rakeback]] and some offer poker propping.\n\nSee the [[Online casino#Bonuses|online casino]] article for more on general information on bonuses.\n\n== Compatibility ==\nOnline poker rooms typically operate through a separate piece of software. This may be cross-platform, for example using a [[Java applet]] or [[WebGL]], allowing the program to run equally well on various computer systems such as [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]] and [[macOS]]. However, many online poker rooms offer downloadable programs designed only for Microsoft Windows which require a compatibility layer such as [[Wine (software)|Wine]] to run on [[Macintosh]] or [[Linux]] computers. Some sites do make available clients that run natively on Mac or Linux.\n\nSome poker rooms have started offering poker on portable devices ([[mobile phone]]s, [[smart phone]]s, [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s). The functionality of mobile online poker software is much the same as computer-based clients, albeit adapted to the interface of mobile devices. The player must be able to receive a WiFi or cell phone signal in order to play.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Computer poker players]]\n*[[:Category:Poker companies|Poker companies]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n<!--========================({{No More Links}})============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.
