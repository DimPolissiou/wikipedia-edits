They were divided into three ranks, of which the [[hastati|front rank]] also carried two javelins, while the [[principes|second]] and [[triari|third]] ranks had a [[Hasta (spear)|thrusting spear]] instead. Both legionary [[Maniple (military unit)|sub-units]] and individual [[legionary|legionaries]] fought in relatively open order.

Many would be from North Africa which provided several types of fighters including: close-order infantry equipped with large shields, helmets, short swords and long thrusting [[spear]]s; javelin-armed [[light infantry]] [[skirmisher]]s; close-order shock cavalry carrying spears; and light cavalry skirmishers who threw javelins from a distance and avoided close combat.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}{{sfn|Koon|2015|p=80}} Both Spain and [[Gaul]] provided small numbers of experienced infantry; unarmoured troops who would charge ferociously, but had a reputation for breaking off if a combat was protracted.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=9}}{{#tag:ref|The Spanish used a heavy throwing spear which the Romans were later to adopt as the ''[[pilum]]''.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}|group=note}} The close order Libyan infantry would fight in a tightly-packed formation known as a [[phalanx]].{{sfn|Koon|2015|p=80}} [[Sling (weapon)|Slingers]] were frequently recruited from the Balearic Islands, although it is not clear if any were present at Tunis.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=8}} The Carthaginians also employed [[war elephant]]s; North Africa had indigenous [[African forest elephant]]s at the time.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=9}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=27}}{{#tag:ref|These elephants were typically about {{convert|2.5|m|ft|sigfig=1|adj=mid|-high}} at the shoulder, and should not be confused with the larger [[African bush elephant]].{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=240}}|group=note}}\n\n==Background==\n[[File:First Punic War 264 BC v2.png|thumb|upright=1.1|alt=A map of the western Mediterranean showing the territory controlled by Carthage and Rome at the start of the First Punic War.|{{center|Territory controlled by Rome and Carthage at the start of the [[First Punic War]]}}]]\n\nThe [[Roman Republic]] had been [[Roman expansion in Italy|aggressively expanding]] in the southern Italian mainland for a century before the First Punic War.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=157\u2013158}} It had conquered peninsular Italy south of the River [[Arno]] by 272 BC.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=21\u201322}} During this period [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]], with its capital in what is now [[Tunisia]], had come to dominate southern [[Spain]], much of the coastal regions of [[North Africa]], the [[Balearic Islands]], [[Corsica]], [[Sardinia]], and the western half of [[Sicily]] in a military and commercial empire.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=29\u201330}} In 264 BC Carthage and Rome were the preeminent powers in the western Mediterranean.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=25\u201326}} The two states had several times asserted their mutual friendship via [[Treaties between Rome and Carthage|formal alliances]]: in 509 BC, 348 BC and around 279 BC.

Their entire fleet, under both consuls, attacked Panormus early in the year. The city was surrounded and blockaded, and siege engines set up.

The 14,000 inhabitants who could afford it ransomed themselves and the remaining 13,000 were sold into slavery.

The Roman commander, [[Lucius Caecilius Metellus (consul 251 BC)|Lucius Caecilius Metellus]] sent out skirmishers to harass the Carthaginians, keeping them constantly supplied with javelins from the stocks within the city. The ground was covered with [[earthworks (military)|earthworks]] constructed during the Roman siege, making it difficult for the elephants to advance. Peppered with missiles and unable to retaliate, the elephants fled through the Carthaginian infantry behind them.

I, p. 102.</ref> between a [[Roman Republic|Roman]] [[consular]] army led by [[Lucius Caecilius Metellus (died 221 BC)|Lucius Caecilius Metellus]] and [[Carthage (state)|Carthaginians]] led by [[Hasdrubal]] during the [[First Punic War]]. The resulting Roman victory led to [[Palermo|Panormus]] remaining under Roman control for the remainder of the war.\n\n== Prelude ==\nTowards the end of 252 BC or early 251 BC, Carthage had put down a Libyan revolt in Africa and sent an army under the command of [[Hasdrubal]], son of [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno the Great]], to [[Sicily]]. Hasdrubal was present at the [[Battle of Tunis]], along with the Greek [[mercenary]] general [[Xanthippus of Carthage|Xanthippus]], and learned much from this experience. According to [[Polybius]], Hasdrubal roamed the region of western Sicily around the cities of [[Lilybaeum]] and [[Selinus]] for two years unopposed by the Romans who kept to high ground. However, Hasdrubal decided to attack a Roman consular army under the command of Consul [[Lucius Caecilius Metellus (died 221 BC)|Lucius Caecilius Metellus]], which was gathering the harvest around Panormus. Hasdrubal marched his men and elephants through the Orethus valley towards Panormus. This operation seemed reasonable because the other consular army was on its way to Rome and the conditions were favourable.\n\n== Battle ==\n[[File:C._Caecilius_Metellus_Caprarius,_denarius,_125_BC,_RRC_269-1.jpg|thumb|[[Denarius]] of [[Gaius Caecilius Metellus Caprarius|C.

The reverse depicts the triumph of his ancestor [[Lucius Caecilius Metellus (consul 251 BC)|Lucius Caecilius Metellus]], with the elephants he had captured at [[Battle of Panormus|Panormos]]. The elephant had since become the emblem of the powerful [[Caecilia (gens)|Caecilii Metelli]].<ref>Crawford, ''Roman Republican Coinage'', pp. 292, 293.</ref>|300x300px]]\nHaving caused the Romans to retreat behind the walls of Panormus, and subsequently ravaged the countryside, Hasdrubal's forces came towards the city by exiting the valley and crossing the Orethus River. Metellus ordered his light troops to harass the Carthaginian vanguard and discharge their javelins into the elephants. In order to do this, the Roman light troops took cover in the ditches that surrounded the city. The commander of the Carthaginian elephants, believing the resistance to be weak, advanced to scatter the light troops. The elephants were now exposed and javelins and missiles discharged upon them from both the city walls and the entrenched light troops caused them to panic and charge into their own ranks. At this point, Metellus and his legions were stationed outside of a city gate facing the Carthaginian left. At the fleeing of the elephants, Metellus ordered the legions to charge the Carthaginian left flank. This manoeuvre broke the Carthaginian line and routed their army. However, the Romans did not pursue the fleeing army but rather captured the remainder of the elephants, who were later slaughtered in the circus in Rome.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAs was custom after a defeat, Hasdrubal was recalled to Carthage to be executed. His successor, Adhubal, decided Selinus could no longer be garrisoned and had the town destroyed. With the exception of Hamilcar Barca's guerrilla warfare, this defeat marked the end of significant Carthaginian land campaigning in Sicily.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n=== Ancient sources ===\n* Titus Livius ([[Livy]]), ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|History of Rome]]'', ''Periochae.''\n* [[Polybius]], ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|Historiae]]'' (The Histories).\n\n=== Modern sources ===\n* [[Michael Crawford (historian)|Michael Crawford]], ''Roman Republican Coinage'', Cambridge University Press, 1974.\n*M.

As Gene leaves, the receptionist stops him briefly due to confusion over his identification but it is shortly cleared up. Gene takes a taxi ride home, but becomes uneasy when he recognizes the driver keeps making eye contact with him, and he sees an [[Albuquerque Isotopes]] air freshener on the rear view mirror. He asks to be let out and walks the rest of the way home quickly.\n\n===Main story===\nHoward calls Jimmy and Kim about the fire at Chuck's, and they arrive as Chuck's body is taken away. Jimmy sees the electrical appliances outside Chuck's home, and realizes his electromagnetic hypersensitivity symptoms must have come back after their last meeting, and he falls into a deep depression which Kim tries to help him out of. Howard takes on responsibility of arranging Chuck's funeral.\n\nMike receives his first payment from Madrigal Electromotive as a contracted \"security consultant\" which Gus arranged to launder the money Mike stole from the Salamancas. Though meant to be a paper job, Mike enters a Madrigal facility and performs a detailed security audit and turns the results to the facility manager, insisting he let Lydia know he stopped by.\n\nAn ambulance comes to take Hector to the hospital after suffering a stroke at the meeting with Gus and Nacho. Following Mike's advice, Nacho reverses the medication swap before Hector is taken, replacing the fake [[ibuprofen]] pills with Hector's real [[nitroglycerin]] medication. He then tries to dispose of the pills but is interrupted by Gus as they need to meet with Juan Bolsa immediately. There, Juan Bolsa puts Nacho and Arturo in charge of the Salamanca operation for the time being, despite Gus's concerns that continued use of the Salamancas may draw DEA attention. Afterwards, Nacho drives to a bridge and throws the ibuprofen away, unaware Victor has followed him.\n\nSeveral of Chuck's former associates attend his funeral and give Jimmy their condolences. After the service, Howard speaks candidly to Jimmy and Kim, believing that Chuck relapsed after he had forced Chuck out of HHM, and fells responsible for Chuck's death. After Howard leaves, Kim is shocked as Jimmy immediately regains his happy-go-lucky composure.\n\n==Production==\nIn the first scene from the first episode of season 4, Saul is at his workplace in a [[Nebraska]] [[Cinnabon]].

As Gene leaves, the receptionist stops him briefly due to confusion over his identification but it is shortly cleared up. Gene takes a taxi ride home, but becomes uneasy when he recognizes the driver keeps making eye contact with him, and he sees an [[Albuquerque Isotopes]] air freshener on the rear view mirror. He asks to be let out and walks the rest of the way home quickly.\n\n===Main story===\nHoward calls Jimmy and Kim about the fire at Chuck's, and they arrive as Chuck's body is taken away. Jimmy sees the electrical appliances outside Chuck's home, and realizes his electromagnetic hypersensitivity symptoms must have come back after their last meeting, and he falls into a deep depression which Kim tries to help him out of. Howard takes on responsibility of arranging Chuck's funeral.\n\nMike receives his first payment from Madrigal Electromotive as a contracted \"security consultant\" which Gus arranged to launder the money Mike stole from the Salamancas. Though meant to be a paper job, Mike enters a Madrigal facility and performs a detailed security audit and turns the results to the facility manager, insisting he let Lydia he know he stopped by.\n\nAn ambulance comes to take Hector to the hospital after suffering a stroke at the meeting with Gus and Nacho. Following Mike's advice, Nacho reverses the medication swap before Hector is taken, replacing the fake [[ibuprofen]] pills with Hector's real [[nitroglycerin]] medication. He then tries to dispose of the pills but is interrupted by Gus as they need to meet with Juan Bolsa immediately. There, Juan Bolsa puts Nacho and Arturo in charge of the Salamanca operation for the time being, despite Gus's concerns that continued use of the Salamancas may draw DEA attention. Afterwards, Nacho drives to a bridge and throws the ibuprofen away, unaware Victor has followed him.\n\nSeveral of Chuck's former associates attend his funeral and give Jimmy their condolences. After the service, Howard speaks candidly to Jimmy and Kim, believing that Chuck relapsed after he had forced Chuck out of HHM, and fells responsible for Chuck's death. After Howard leaves, Kim is shocked as Jimmy immediately regains his happy-go-lucky composure.\n\n==Production==\nIn the first scene from the first episode of season 4, Saul is at his workplace in a [[Nebraska]] [[Cinnabon]].

During his career, he played for the [[New York Highlanders]] (1905\u20131913), [[Chicago White Sox]] (1913\u20131914), [[Buffalo Blues]] (1914\u20131915), [[Cincinnati Reds]] (1916\u20131918), and [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] (1919).\n\n[[Babe Ruth]] and [[Walter Johnson]] named Chase the best first baseman ever, and contemporary reports described his glovework as outstanding. He is sometimes considered the first true star of the franchise that would eventually become the New York Yankees.  In 1981, 62 years after his last major league game, baseball historians [[Lawrence Ritter]] and [[Donald Honig]] included him in their book ''The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time''.\n\nDespite being an excellent hitter and his reputation as a peerless defensive player, Chase's legacy was tainted by a litany of corruption.  He allegedly gambled on baseball games, and also engaged in suspicious play in order to [[Match fixing|throw]] games in which he played.\n\n==Career==\nChase attended [[Santa Clara College]], where he played baseball. He signed his first contract with the [[Los Angeles Angels (PCL)|Los Angeles Angels]] of the Class-A [[Pacific Coast League]] in 1904. The [[New York Highlanders]] selected Chase from Los Angeles in the 1904 [[Rule 5 draft]] on October 4, 1904.\n\nChase joined the Highlanders in 1905, and held out during March 1907, threatening to sign with the outlaw [[California League]] if the Highlanders did not increase his salary.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GAsbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=z0gEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3385,1013103&dq=clark-griffith+hal-chase&hl=en ''The Pittsburgh Press''] via Google News Archive Search</ref><ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0vtIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jwINAAAAIBAJ&pg=1376,4411495&dq=clark-griffith+hal-chase&hl=en ''The Meriden Daily Journal''] via Google News Archive Search</ref> Though he agreed to join the Highlanders in April 1907,<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EdZIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DwINAAAAIBAJ&pg=1552,5548759&dq=billy-gilbert+columbia&hl=en ''The Meriden Daily Journal''] via Google News Archive Search</ref> he also insisted on playing in the California League during the winter.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=92FYAAAAIBAJ&sjid=v0UNAAAAIBAJ&pg=4949,6912961&dq=clark-griffith+highlanders&hl=en ''The Toledo News-Bee''] via Google News Archive Search</ref> After the Highlanders fired manager [[Clark Griffith]] during the 1908 season, Chase held out and insisted he would not play for new manager [[Kid Elberfeld]].<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=H69GAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ovgMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6476,456616&dq=clark-griffith+highlanders&hl=en ''The Day''] via Google News Archive Search</ref>  Chase loved playing in the off season in California leagues, which he did nearly every year.  And nearly every year, as the major league season approached, Chase looked for a way to remain playing in California.  But due to the power of the National Agreement and insufficient finances of leagues and teams in California, Chase predictably returned to his major league team in honor of his contract.<ref>{{Cite book|title=California Baseball, From the Pioneers to the Glory Years|last=Goode|first=Christopher|publisher=Lulu Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nChase served as [[player\u2013manager]] in 1910 and 1911.

White Sox owner [[Charles Comiskey]] filed an injunction to prevent Chase from playing citing a violation of the [[reserve clause]].  Chase challenged the injunction in court and won, becoming one of the only players to successfully challenge the reserve clause.  The ensuing animosity between Comiskey and Chase would effectively permanently bar Chase from playing again in the American League.<ref>{{Cite book|title=California Baseball, From the Pioneers to the Glory Years|last=Goode|first=Christopher|publisher=Lulu Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a spell in the short-lived Federal League, he went to the Reds.

But Stallings was unpopular with the team, and Chase was slated to replace Stallings at the helm.  Chase ultimately prevailed in the spat and became the manager of the team, at the age of 28, in 1911, a year he hit .315 with 82 RBI.  \n\nChase was replaced as manager by [[Harry Wolverton]], followed by [[Frank Chance]] in 1913.  Chase battled injuries that impaired his play; many felt that Chase either would not or could not return to his previous form.  Frank Chance stated that he worried that Chase was \"laying down.\"  Chance clarified that he was referring to the question whether Chase would put forth the effort necessary to overcome the current slump.<ref>{{Cite book|title=California Baseball, From the Pioneers to the Glory Years|last=Goode|first=Christopher|publisher=Lulu Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> \n\nChance benched Chase, who was batting .212. On June 1, the Yankees announced that Chase had been traded to the [[Chicago White Sox]] for two infielders of modest abilities, [[Rollie Zeider]] and [[Babe Borton]].<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/sports/baseball/yankees-1913-season-was-sunk-by-a-rogue-captain-hal-chase.html?ref=baseball|title=Yankees\u2019 1913 Season Was Sunk by a Rogue Captain|date=February 24, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=May 20, 2013}}</ref>  There have been claims of wrongdoing by Chase during this era, but none have been substantiated.<ref>{{Cite book|title=California Baseball, From the Pioneers to the Glory Years|last=Goode|first=Christopher|publisher=Lulu Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nMidway through the 1918 season, Chase allegedly paid [[pitcher]] [[Jimmy Ring]] $50 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50|1918}}}} in current dollar terms) to throw a game against the Giants. \n\nWhen the Giants went to spring training for the 1920 season, Chase was not with them. Later, it emerged that Chase had bribed Cubs outfielder [[Lee Magee]] not to hustle in certain games. When Magee confessed this to league president [[John Heydler]] behind closed doors, Heydler told Giants manager [[John McGraw]] to release Chase. [[Heinie Zimmerman]], also implicated in bribing players, was released as well.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://research.sabr.org/journals/hal-chase-case|title=The Hal Chase Case|author1=Robert C. Hoie|publisher=[[Society for American Baseball Research]]|date=2013}}</ref> Since no American League team would sign him, Chase was effectively blackballed from the major leagues.\n\n==Out of organized baseball==\nRumors of his being the middleman between the players and the gamblers in the [[Black Sox Scandal]] have never been confirmed. A Chicago grand jury indicted him for his role in the scandal, but California refused extradition because of an incorrectly issued arrest warrant.<ref>Paul C. Weiler et al., Sports and the Law: Text, Cases and Problems 134 (4th ed. 2011).</ref> \n\nIn 1920, while playing for the minor Mission League, he allegedly attempted to bribe Spider Baum, a pitcher for the [[Salt Lake Bees]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]], to lose a game to the [[Los Angeles Angels (PCL)|Los Angeles Angels]].  It turned out to be one of the last games he played in organized baseball.  In the aftermath of the Black Sox Scandal, newly appointed [[Commissioner of Baseball]] [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] declared no player who threw a game or promised to throw a game would ever be allowed in baseball\u2014effectively ending any realistic chance of Chase returning to the majors.\n\nChase was recruited and hired by the Nogales Internationals to play first base and manage the club for the 1923 season. Chase played for a team in [[Williams, Arizona]], playing games in other mining towns such as Jerome. In early March 1925, newspapers reported that Chase was negotiating with the President of Mexico to become the commissioner of a new Mexican Baseball League. <ref>http://www.bevillsadvocate.com/?page_id=51 Prince Hal and his Arizona Odyssey</ref>\n\nFor a time, Chase was player-manager of an outlaw team in [[Douglas, Arizona]] that included [[Buck Weaver]], [[Chick Gandil]] and [[Lefty Williams]]. It was part of a league run by [[S.L.A. Marshall]], who later said that Chase admitted to throwing a game. A few months later, he tore both [[Achilles tendon]]s in a car accident. He later drifted to Mexico, where in 1925 he began making plans to organize a professional league.  When American League president [[Ban Johnson]] got word of it, however, he pressured Mexican authorities to deport Chase.\n\nDespite his unsavory past, Chase received a certain amount of [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]] support early in its history. During the inaugural Hall of Fame balloting of 1936, Chase garnered 11 votes and was named on 4.9% of the ballots. This total was more votes than 18 future Hall of Famers including such greats as [[Connie Mack]], [[Rube Marquard]], [[Mordecai Brown|Mordecai \"Three Finger\" Brown]], [[Charlie Gehringer]], and [[John McGraw]] as well as the banned [[Shoeless Joe Jackson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/hof_1936.shtml |title=1936 Hall of Fame Voting |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-20}}</ref> In 1937, he received 18 votes (9%) which was more than 32 future Hall of Famers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/hof_1937.shtml |title=1937 Hall of Fame Voting |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-20}}</ref> Chase was dropped from the ballot following the 1937 vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/hof_1938.shtml |title=1938 Hall of Fame Voting |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-20}}</ref>  He never received the 75 percent support required for enshrinement, largely due to an informal agreement among the Hall of Fame voters that those deemed to have been banned from baseball should be ineligible for consideration.\n\nChase spent the rest of his life drifting between Arizona and his native California, working numerous [[low-paying job]]s. Later in life, he expressed considerable remorse for betting on baseball. He lived with his sister in [[Williams, California]] and died in a [[Colusa, California]] hospital at the age of 64.<ref name=obit/><ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vf5HAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ov8MAAAAIBAJ&pg=3185,4087869&dq=clark-griffith+hal-chase&hl=en ''Meriden Record''] via Google News Archive Search</ref>\n\n==Chase defensively==\nIn his day, Hal Chase was almost universally considered one of the best fielders in the game&nbsp;\u2014 not just at first base, but at ''any'' position, even compared to catchers and middle infielders. In his ''Historical Baseball Abstract'', [[Bill James]] quotes a poem entitled \"You Can't Escape 'Em\":\n\n''Sometimes a raw recruit in spring is not a pitching find;''\n\n''He has not [[Walter Johnson]]'s wing, nor [[Christy Mathewson|Matty]]'s wonderous mind.''\n\n''He does not act like Harold Chase upon the fielding job,''\n\n''But you may find in such a case, he hits like [[Ty Cobb|Tyrus Cobb]].''\n\n[[Douglas Dewey]] and [[Nicholas Acocella]]'s book on Chase, ''The Black Prince Of Baseball'', talks about Chase's defensive abilities at length. He apparently made many spectacular plays that burnished his reputation as a glove wizard, but also committed 402 errors at first in just ten seasons, making his career fielding average only .980, four points below average for the period (since Chase was known to throw games, it's impossible to know how many of these misplays were intentional).\n\nA more recent work by Bill James, ''[[Win Shares]]'', suggested Chase was only a C-grade defensive player at first base. According to analyst Sean Smith of [[Baseball-Reference.com]], Chase was below average defensively, costing his teams 65 runs versus an average first baseman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/chaseha01.shtml |title=Hal Chase Statistics and History |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-20}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Baseball}}\n*[[List of Major League Baseball career stolen bases leaders]]\n*[[List of Major League Baseball player-managers]]\n\n==References==\n;Bibliography\n*Ginsburg, Daniel E.

During his career, he played for the [[New York Highlanders]] (1905\u20131913), [[Chicago White Sox]] (1913\u20131914), [[Buffalo Blues]] (1914\u20131915), [[Cincinnati Reds]] (1916\u20131918), and [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] (1919).\n\n[[Babe Ruth]] and [[Walter Johnson]] named Chase the best first baseman ever, and contemporary reports described his glovework as outstanding. He is sometimes considered the first true star of the franchise that would eventually become the New York Yankees.  In 1981, 62 years after his last major league game, baseball historians [[Lawrence Ritter]] and [[Donald Honig]] included him in their book ''The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time''.\n\nDespite being an excellent hitter and his reputation as a peerless defensive player, Chase's legacy was tainted by a litany of corruption.  He allegedly gambled on baseball games, and also engaged in suspicious play in order to [[Match fixing|throw]] games in which he played.\n\n==Career==\nChase attended [[Santa Clara College]], where he played baseball. He signed his first contract with the [[Los Angeles Angels (PCL)|Los Angeles Angels]] of the Class-A [[Pacific Coast League]] in 1904. The [[New York Highlanders]] selected Chase from Los Angeles in the 1904 [[Rule 5 draft]] on October 4, 1904.\n\nChase joined the Highlanders in 1905, and held out during March 1907, threatening to sign with the outlaw [[California League]] if the Highlanders did not increase his salary.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GAsbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=z0gEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3385,1013103&dq=clark-griffith+hal-chase&hl=en ''The Pittsburgh Press''] via Google News Archive Search</ref><ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0vtIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jwINAAAAIBAJ&pg=1376,4411495&dq=clark-griffith+hal-chase&hl=en ''The Meriden Daily Journal''] via Google News Archive Search</ref> Though he agreed to join the Highlanders in April 1907,<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EdZIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DwINAAAAIBAJ&pg=1552,5548759&dq=billy-gilbert+columbia&hl=en ''The Meriden Daily Journal''] via Google News Archive Search</ref> he also insisted on playing in the California League during the winter.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=92FYAAAAIBAJ&sjid=v0UNAAAAIBAJ&pg=4949,6912961&dq=clark-griffith+highlanders&hl=en ''The Toledo News-Bee''] via Google News Archive Search</ref> After the Highlanders fired manager [[Clark Griffith]] during the 1908 season, Chase held out and insisted he would not play for new manager [[Kid Elberfeld]].<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=H69GAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ovgMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6476,456616&dq=clark-griffith+highlanders&hl=en ''The Day''] via Google News Archive Search</ref>  Chase loved playing in the off season in California leagues, which he did nearly every year.  And nearly every year, as the major league season approached, Chase looked for a way to remain playing in California.  But due to the power of the National Agreement and insufficient finances of leagues and teams in California, Chase predictably returned to his major league team in honor of his contract.<ref>{{Cite book|title=California Baseball, From the Pioneers to the Glory Years|last=Goode|first=Christopher|publisher=Lulu Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nChase served as [[player\u2013manager]] in 1910 and 1911. He signed a three-year contract with the Yankees before the 1913 season,<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Ex9RAAAAIBAJ&sjid=TWYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2826,5022959&dq=clark-griffith+highlanders&hl=en ''The Gazette Times''] via Google News Archive Search</ref> but they traded him to the [[Chicago White Sox]] for [[Babe Borton]] and [[Rollie Zeider]] on June 1, 1913.<ref>https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/aab1d59b</ref> \n\nBefore the 1914 season, Chase jumped from the White Sox to the [[Buffalo Blues]] of the [[Federal League]]. White Sox owner [[Charles Comiskey]] filed an injunction to prevent Chase from playing citing a violation of the [[reserve clause]].  Chase challenged the injunction in court and won, becoming one of the only players to successfully challenge the reserve clause.  The ensuing animosity between Comiskey and Chase would effectively permanently bar Chase from playing again in the American League.<ref>{{Cite book|title=California Baseball, From the Pioneers to the Glory Years|last=Goode|first=Christopher|publisher=Lulu Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a spell in the short-lived Federal League, he went to the Reds. In 1916, Chase led the NL with a .339 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]].<ref name=\"obit\">[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fB4vAAAAIBAJ&sjid=IdwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3062,4392193&dq=clark-griffith+hal-chase&hl=en ''Ottawa Citizen''] via Google News Archive Search</ref> \n\nOn February 19, 1919, the Reds traded Chase to the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] for [[Walter Holke]] and [[Bill Rariden]].\n\n==Corruption==\n\nChase faced allegations of wrongdoing as early as 1910, when his manager, [[George Stallings]], claimed that Chase was \"laying down\" in games.  But Stallings was unpopular with the team, and Chase was slated to replace Stallings at the helm.  Chase ultimately prevailed in the spat and became the manager of the team, at the age of 28, in 1911, a year he hit .315 with 82 RBI.  \n\nChase was replaced as manager by [[Harry Wolverton]], followed by [[Frank Chance]] in 1913.  Chase battled injuries that impaired his play; many felt that Chase either would not or could not return to his previous form.  Frank Chance stated that he worried that Chase was \"laying down.\"  Chance clarified that he was referring to the question whether Chase would put forth the effort necessary to overcome the current slump.<ref>{{Cite book|title=California Baseball, From the Pioneers to the Glory Years|last=Goode|first=Christopher|publisher=Lulu Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> \n\nChance benched Chase, who was batting .212. On June 1, the Yankees announced that Chase had been traded to the [[Chicago White Sox]] for two infielders of modest abilities, [[Rollie Zeider]] and [[Babe Borton]].<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/sports/baseball/yankees-1913-season-was-sunk-by-a-rogue-captain-hal-chase.html?ref=baseball|title=Yankees\u2019 1913 Season Was Sunk by a Rogue Captain|date=February 24, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=May 20, 2013}}</ref>  There have been claims of wrongdoing by Chase during this era, but none have been substantiated.<ref>{{Cite book|title=California Baseball, From the Pioneers to the Glory Years|last=Goode|first=Christopher|publisher=Lulu Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nMidway through the 1918 season, Chase allegedly paid [[pitcher]] [[Jimmy Ring]] $50 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50|1918}}}} in current dollar terms) to throw a game against the Giants. \n\nWhen the Giants went to spring training for the 1920 season, Chase was not with them. Later, it emerged that Chase had bribed Cubs outfielder [[Lee Magee]] not to hustle in certain games. When Magee confessed this to league president [[John Heydler]] behind closed doors, Heydler told Giants manager [[John McGraw]] to release Chase. [[Heinie Zimmerman]], also implicated in bribing players, was released as well.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://research.sabr.org/journals/hal-chase-case|title=The Hal Chase Case|author1=Robert C. Hoie|publisher=[[Society for American Baseball Research]]|date=2013}}</ref> Since no American League team would sign him, Chase was effectively blackballed from the major leagues.\n\n==Out of organized baseball==\nRumors of his being the middleman between the players and the gamblers in the [[Black Sox Scandal]] have never been confirmed. A Chicago grand jury indicted him for his role in the scandal, but California refused extradition because of an incorrectly issued arrest warrant.<ref>Paul C. Weiler et al., Sports and the Law: Text, Cases and Problems 134 (4th ed. 2011).</ref> \n\nIn 1920, while playing for the minor Mission League, he allegedly attempted to bribe Spider Baum, a pitcher for the [[Salt Lake Bees]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]], to lose a game to the [[Los Angeles Angels (PCL)|Los Angeles Angels]].  It turned out to be one of the last games he played in organized baseball.  In the aftermath of the Black Sox Scandal, newly appointed [[Commissioner of Baseball]] [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] declared no player who threw a game or promised to throw a game would ever be allowed in baseball\u2014effectively ending any realistic chance of Chase returning to the majors.\n\nChase was recruited and hired by the Nogales Internationals to play first base and manage the club for the 1923 season. Chase played for a team in [[Williams, Arizona]], playing games in other mining towns such as Jerome. In early March 1925, newspapers reported that Chase was negotiating with the President of Mexico to become the commissioner of a new Mexican Baseball League. <ref>http://www.bevillsadvocate.com/?page_id=51 Prince Hal and his Arizona Odyssey</ref>\n\nFor a time, Chase was player-manager of an outlaw team in [[Douglas, Arizona]] that included [[Buck Weaver]], [[Chick Gandil]] and [[Lefty Williams]]. It was part of a league run by [[S.L.A. Marshall]], who later said that Chase admitted to throwing a game. A few months later, he tore both [[Achilles tendon]]s in a car accident. He later drifted to Mexico, where in 1925 he began making plans to organize a professional league.  When American League president [[Ban Johnson]] got word of it, however, he pressured Mexican authorities to deport Chase.\n\nDespite his unsavory past, Chase received a certain amount of [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]] support early in its history. During the inaugural Hall of Fame balloting of 1936, Chase garnered 11 votes and was named on 4.9% of the ballots. This total was more votes than 18 future Hall of Famers including such greats as [[Connie Mack]], [[Rube Marquard]], [[Mordecai Brown|Mordecai \"Three Finger\" Brown]], [[Charlie Gehringer]], and [[John McGraw]] as well as the banned [[Shoeless Joe Jackson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/hof_1936.shtml |title=1936 Hall of Fame Voting |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-20}}</ref> In 1937, he received 18 votes (9%) which was more than 32 future Hall of Famers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/hof_1937.shtml |title=1937 Hall of Fame Voting |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-20}}</ref> Chase was dropped from the ballot following the 1937 vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/hof_1938.shtml |title=1938 Hall of Fame Voting |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-20}}</ref>  He never received the 75 percent support required for enshrinement, largely due to an informal agreement among the Hall of Fame voters that those deemed to have been banned from baseball should be ineligible for consideration.\n\nChase spent the rest of his life drifting between Arizona and his native California, working numerous [[low-paying job]]s. Later in life, he expressed considerable remorse for betting on baseball. He lived with his sister in [[Williams, California]] and died in a [[Colusa, California]] hospital at the age of 64.<ref name=obit/><ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vf5HAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ov8MAAAAIBAJ&pg=3185,4087869&dq=clark-griffith+hal-chase&hl=en ''Meriden Record''] via Google News Archive Search</ref>\n\n==Chase defensively==\nIn his day, Hal Chase was almost universally considered one of the best fielders in the game&nbsp;\u2014 not just at first base, but at ''any'' position, even compared to catchers and middle infielders. In his ''Historical Baseball Abstract'', [[Bill James]] quotes a poem entitled \"You Can't Escape 'Em\":\n\n''Sometimes a raw recruit in spring is not a pitching find;''\n\n''He has not [[Walter Johnson]]'s wing, nor [[Christy Mathewson|Matty]]'s wonderous mind.''\n\n''He does not act like Harold Chase upon the fielding job,''\n\n''But you may find in such a case, he hits like [[Ty Cobb|Tyrus Cobb]].''\n\n[[Douglas Dewey]] and [[Nicholas Acocella]]'s book on Chase, ''The Black Prince Of Baseball'', talks about Chase's defensive abilities at length. He apparently made many spectacular plays that burnished his reputation as a glove wizard, but also committed 402 errors at first in just ten seasons, making his career fielding average only .980, four points below average for the period (since Chase was known to throw games, it's impossible to know how many of these misplays were intentional).\n\nA more recent work by Bill James, ''[[Win Shares]]'', suggested Chase was only a C-grade defensive player at first base. According to analyst Sean Smith of [[Baseball-Reference.com]], Chase was below average defensively, costing his teams 65 runs versus an average first baseman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/chaseha01.shtml |title=Hal Chase Statistics and History |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-20}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Baseball}}\n*[[List of Major League Baseball career stolen bases leaders]]\n*[[List of Major League Baseball player-managers]]\n\n==References==\n;Bibliography\n*Ginsburg, Daniel E.
