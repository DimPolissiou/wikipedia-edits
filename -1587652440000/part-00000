Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1972, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> \n\nBanneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

At this time, trade fairs were held at a site in the south of the city, near the [[Monument to the Battle of the Nations]].\n\nThe planned economy of the German Democratic Republic, however, was not kind to Leipzig. Before the Second World War, Leipzig had developed a mixture of industry, creative business (notably publishing), and services (including legal services). During the period of the German Democratic Republic, services became the concern of the state, concentrated in (East) Berlin; creative business moved to West Germany; and Leipzig was left only with heavy industry. To make bad worse, this industry was extremely polluting, making Leipzig an even less attractive city to live in.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://theprotocity.com/leipzig-back-growth-everyone/|title=Leipzig: Back to Growth, but Not for Everyone|date=2014-08-25|website=TheProtoCity.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref> Between 1950 and the end of the German Democratic Republic, the population of Leipzig fell from 600,000 to 500,000.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/67845/1/casereport107.pdf|title=Leipzig City Story|last=Power|first=Anne and Elineen Herden|date=May 2016|website=LSE Housing and Communities|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn October 1989, after [[prayer]]s for peace at [[St. Nicholas Church, Leipzig|St.&nbsp;Nicholas Church]], established in 1983 as part of the peace movement, the [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|Monday demonstrations]] started as the most prominent mass protest against the [[Government of East Germany|East German government]].<ref>David Brebis (ed.), ''Michelin guide to Germany'', Greenville (2006), p. 324.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8297630.stm|title=The day I outflanked the Stasi|publisher=BBC|date=9 October 2009}} + video.</ref> The [[reunification of Germany]], however, was at first not good for Leipzig.

There are also several [[Baroque architecture|baroque period]] trading houses and former residences of rich merchants. As Leipzig grew considerably during the economic boom of the late-nineteenth century, the town has many buildings in the [[Historicism (art)|historicist style]] representative of the ''[[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]]'' era. Approximately 35% of Leipzig's flats are in buildings of this type. The [[New Town Hall (Leipzig)|new city hall]], completed in 1905, is built in the same style.\n\nSome 64,000 apartments in Leipzig were built in [[Plattenbau]] buildings during Communist rule in East Germany.<ref>[[:de:Liste der Plattenbausiedlungen in Sachsen#Leipzig]]</ref> and although some of these have been demolished and the numbers living in this type of accommodation have declined in recent years, at least 10% of Leipzig's population (50,000 people) are still living in Plattenbau accommodation.<ref>[[:de:Plattenbauten in Leipzig]]</ref> Gr\u00fcnau, for example, has approximately 40,000 people living in this sort of accommodation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leipzig.de/gruenau/|title=Leipzig-Gr\u00fcnau|work=leipzig.de}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Paulinerkirche, Leipzig|St. Paul's Church]] was destroyed by the Communist government in 1968 to make room for a new main building for the university. After some debate, the city decided to establish a new, mainly secular building at the same location, called [[Paulinum (University of Leipzig)|Paulinum]], which was completed in 2012. Its architecture alludes to the look of the former church and it includes space for religious use by the faculty of theology, including the original altar from the old church and two newly built organs.\n\nMany commercial buildings were built in the 1990s as a result of tax breaks after German reunification.\n\n===Tallest buildings and structures===\nThe tallest structure in Leipzig is the chimney of the Stahl- und Hartgusswerk B\u00f6sdorf GmbH with a height of {{convert|205|m|ft|abbr=off}}.

After the [[Reunification of Germany]], immense efforts to restore and expand the traffic network have been undertaken and left the city area with an excellent infrastructure.\n\n===Rail===\n\n[[File:Bahnhof Leipzig von Panorama Tower 2013.jpg|thumb|right|[[Leipzig Hauptbahnhof]] is the main hub of tram and rail network and the world's largest railway station by floor area.]]\n[[File:Leipziger Bahnhof (228148125).jpeg|thumb|right|Inside Leipzig main station.]]\nOpened in 1915, [[Leipzig Central Station]] is the largest overhead railway station in Europe in terms of its built-up area. At the same time, it is an important supra-regional junction in the ICE and [[Intercity (Deutsche Bahn)|Intercity]] network of the [[Deutsche Bahn]] as well as a connection point for [[S-Bahn]] and regional traffic in the Halle/Leipzig area.\n\nIn Leipzig, the Intercity Express routes (Hamburg-)Berlin-Leipzig-Nuremberg-Munich and Dresden-Leipzig-Erfurt-Frankfurt am Main-(Wiesbaden/Saarbr\u00fccken) intersect. After completion of the high-speed line to Erfurt, the ICE will run on both lines via [[Leipzig/Halle Airport]] and Erfurt. Leipzig is also the starting point for the intercity lines Leipzig-Halle (Saale)-Magdeburg-Braunschweig-Hannover-Dortmund-K\u00f6ln and -Bremen-Oldenburg(-Norddeich Mole). Both lines complement each other at hourly intervals and also stop at Leipzig/Halle Airport. The only international connection is the daily EuroCity Leipzig-Prague.\n\nMost major and medium-sized towns in Saxony and southern Saxony-Anhalt can be reached without changing trains. There are also direct connections via regional express lines to Falkenberg/Elster-Cottbus, Hoyerswerda and Dessau-Magdeburg as well as Chemnitz. Neighbouring Halle (Saale) can be reached via two S-Bahn lines, one of which runs hourly via Leipzig/Halle Airport. The surrounding area of Leipzig is served by numerous regional and S-Bahn lines.\n\nThe city's rail connections are currently being greatly improved by major construction projects, particularly within the framework of the German Unity transport projects. The line to Berlin has been extended and has been passable at 200&nbsp;km/h since 2006. On 13 December 2015, the high-speed line from Leipzig to Erfurt, designed for 300&nbsp;km/h, was put into operation. Its continuation to Nuremberg is scheduled for completion in December 2017. This integration into the high-speed network will considerably reduce the journey times of the ICE from Leipzig to Nuremberg, Munich and Frankfurt am Main. The Leipzig-Dresden railway line, which was the first German long-distance railway to go into operation in 1839, is also undergoing expansion for 200&nbsp;km/h. The ICE will also be able to operate from Leipzig to Dresden in the near future. The most important construction project in regional transport was the four-kilometer-long [[City-Tunnel (Leipzig)|City Tunnel]], which went into operation in December 2013 as the main line of the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]].\n\nFor freight traffic, there are freight stations in the districts of Wahren and Engelsdorf. In addition, a large freight traffic centre has been set up near the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction for goods handling between road and rail, as well as a freight station on the site of the DHL hub at Leipzig/Halle Airport.\n\n===Suburban train===\n\n{{see also|S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland}}\n[[File:S-Bahn - City-Tunnel Leipzig mit BR 182 und Doppelstockwagen (HP Markt).jpg|thumb|right|Trains of S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland at [[Leipzig Markt station]].]]\nLeipzig is the core of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland line network. Together with the tram, six of the ten lines form the backbone of local public transport and an important link to the region and the neighbouring Halle. The main line of the S-Bahn consists of the underground S-Bahn stations Hauptbahnhof, Markt, Wilhelm-Leuschner-Platz and [[Bayerischer Bahnhof]] leading through the City Tunnel as well as the above-ground station Leipzig MDR. There are a total of 30 S-Bahn stations in the Leipzig city area. Endpoints of the S-Bahn lines include Oschatz, Zwickau, Geithain and Bitterfeld. Two lines run to Halle, one of them via Leipzig/Halle Airport. In 2015, the network will be extended to Dessau and Lutherstadt Wittenberg.\n\nWith the timetable change in December 2004, the networks of Leipzig and Halle were combined to form the Leipzig-Halle S-Bahn. However, this network only served as a transitional solution and was replaced by the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland on 15 December 2013. At the same time, the main line tunnel, marketed as the Leipzig City Tunnel, went into operation. The tunnel, which is almost four kilometres long, crosses the entire city centre from the main railway station to the Bavarian railway station. The S-Bahn stations are up to 22 metres underground. This construction was the first to create a continuous north\u2013south axis, which had not existed until now due to the north-facing terminus station. The connection to the south of the city and the federal state will thus be greatly improved.\n\n===Tramway and Buses===\n\n{{see also|Trams in Leipzig}}\n[[File:Leipzig Tram 2017.jpg|thumb|right|Tram at [[Goerdelerring]].]]\nThe [[Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe]], existing since 1 January 1917, operate a total of 13 tram lines and 51 bus lines in the city.\n\nThe total length of the tram network is {{cvt|149.9|km}}, making it the largest in Saxony ({{cvt|130.2|km}}) ahead of Dresden and the second largest in Germany ({{cvt|193.6|km}} after Berlin). The longest line in the Leipzig network is line 11, which connects Schkeuditz with Markkleeberg over 22 kilometres and is the only tram line in Leipzig to run in three tariff zones of the Central German Transport Association.\n\nNight bus lines N1 to N9 and the night tram N17 operate in the night traffic. On Saturdays, Sundays and holidays the tram line N10 and the bus line N60 also operate. The central transfer point between the bus and tram lines as well as to the S-Bahn is Leipzig Central Station.\n\n===Bicycle===\n\nLike most German cities, Leipzig has a traffic layout designed to be [[bicycle-friendly]]. There is an extensive cycle network. In most of the one-way central streets, cyclists are explicitly allowed to cycle both ways. A few cycle paths have been built or declared since 1990.\n\nSince 2004 there is a [[bicycle-sharing system]]. Bikes can be borrowed and returned via smartphone app or by telephone. Since 2018, the system has enabled flexible borrowing and returning of bicycles in the inner city; in this zone, bicycles can be handed in and borrowed from almost any street corner. Outside these zones, there are stations where the bikes are waiting. The current locations of the bikes can be seen via the app. There are cooperation offers with the Leipzig public transport companies and car sharing in order to offer as complete a mobility chain as possible.\n\n===Road===\n\n[[File:Mitteldeutsche-Schleife.png|thumb|Leipzig's road network]]\n[[File:Leipzig-Halle Airport Check-in.jpg|thumb|[[Leipzig/Halle Airport]], hub of [[DHL Express|DHL]]]]\n\nSeveral federal motorways pass by Leipzig: the [[Bundesautobahn 14|A 14]] in the north, the [[Bundesautobahn 9|A 9]] in the west and the [[Bundesautobahn 38|A 38]] in the south. The three motorways form a triangular partial ring of the double ring Mitteldeutsche Schleife around Halle and Leipzig. To the south towards Chemnitz, the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A 72]] is also partly under construction or being planned.\n\nThe [[Bundesstra\u00dfe|federal roads]] [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 2|B 2]], [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 6|B 6]], [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 87|B 87]], [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 181|B 181]], [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 184|B 184]] and [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 186|B 186]] lead through the city area.\n\nThe ring, which corresponds to the course of the old city fortification, surrounds the city centre of Leipzig, which today is largely traffic-calmed.\n\nLeipzig has a dense network of [[carsharing]] stations. Additionally, since 2018 there is also a stationless car sharing system in Leipzig. Here the cars can be parked and booked anywhere in the inner city without having to define a specific car or period in advance. Finding and booking is done via a smartphone app.\n\nApart from the usual taxi traffic, Leipzig is one of the few cities in Germany with a [[Transportation network company|ridesharing provider]]. Taxi-like rides can be booked via an app. However, in contrast to a taxi, the start and destination must be defined beforehand and other passengers can be taken along at the same time if they share a route.\n\n===Long-distance buses===\n\nSince March 2018 there has been a central bus station directly east of Leipzig Central Station.\n\nIn addition to a large number of national lines, several international lines also serve Leipzig. The cities of Bregenz, Budapest, Milan, Prague, Sofia and Zurich, among others, can be reached without having to change trains. Around 30,000 journeys and 1.5&nbsp;million passengers a year are expected at the new bus station.\n\nSome lines also use Leipzig/Halle Airport, located at the A 9/A 14 motorway junction, and [[Leipziger Messe]] for a stop. Passengers can take the S-Bahn from there to the city centre.\n\n===Air===\n\n[[Leipzig/Halle Airport]] is the international commercial airport of the region. It is located at the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction northwest of Leipzig, halfway between the two major cities. The easternmost section of the new Erfurt-Leipzig/Halle line under construction gave the airport a long-distance railway station, which was also integrated into the ICE network when the railway line was completed in 2015.\n\nPassenger flights are operated to the major German hub airports, European metropolises and holiday destinations, especially in the Mediterranean region and North Africa. The airport is of international importance in the cargo sector. In Germany, it ranks second behind Frankfurt am Main, fifth in Europe and 26th worldwide (as of 2011). [[DHL]] uses the airport as its central European hub. It is also the home base of the freight airlines [[Aerologic]] and [[European Air Transport Leipzig]].\n\nThe former military airport near [[Altenburg]], [[Thuringia]] called [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]] about a half-hour drive from Leipzig was served by [[Ryanair]] until 2010.\n\n===Water===\n\n[[File:Leipzig - Elsterflutbett + Palmengartenwehr 01 ies.jpg|thumb|Boats at the [[White Elster|Elsterflutbett]]]]\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the construction of the [[Elster-Saale canal]], [[White Elster]] and [[Saale]] was started in Leipzig in order to connect to the network of waterways. The outbreak of the Second World War stopped most of the work, though some may have continued through the use of [[forced labor]]. The [[Lindenauer port]] was almost completed but not yet connected to the Elster-Saale and [[Karl-Heine canal]] respectively. The Leipzig rivers ([[White Elster]], [[Neue Luppe|New Luppe]], [[Plei\u00dfe]], and [[Parthe]]) in the city have largely artificial river beds and are supplemented by some channels. These waterways are suitable only for small leisure boat traffic.\n\nThrough the renovation and reconstruction of existing [[mill race]]s and watercourses in the south of the city and flooded disused [[open cast mines]], the city's navigable water network is being expanded. The city commissioned planning for a link between Karl Heine Canal and the disused Lindenauer port in 2008. Still more work was scheduled to complete the Elster-Saale canal. Such a move would allow small boats to reach the [[Elbe]] from Leipzig. The intended completion date has been postponed because of an unacceptable cost-benefit ratio.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Leipzig NGT12-LEI Waldplatz defekt.jpg|Tram of [[Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe]]\nFile:Leipzig Georg-Schumann-Strasse.jpg|Tramsystem at the Georg-Schumann-Stra\u00dfe\nFile:S-Bahnhof Leipzig Markt.jpg|[[Leipzig City Tunnel]], part of Leipzig's new [[S-Bahn]] network\nFile:S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland.

It was the largest battle in Europe before the First World War and the coalition victory ended [[Napoleon]]'s presence in Germany and would ultimately lead to his first exile on [[Elba]]. The [[Monument to the Battle of the Nations]] celebrating the centenary of this event was completed in 1913. In addition to stimulating German nationalism, the war had a major impact in mobilizing a civic spirit in numerous volunteer activities. Many volunteer militias and civic associations were formed, and collaborated with churches and the press to support local and state militias, patriotic wartime mobilization, humanitarian relief and postwar commemorative practices and rituals.<ref>Katherine Aaslestad, \"Cities and War: Modern Military Urbanism in Hamburg and Leipzig during the Napoleonic Era.\" ''German History'' 35.3 (2017): 381-402.</ref>\n\nWhen it was made a terminus of the first German long-distance [[railway]] to [[Dresden]] (the capital of Saxony) in 1839, Leipzig became a hub of [[Central Europe]]an railway traffic, with [[Leipzig Hauptbahnhof]] the largest [[terminal station]] by area in Europe. The railway station has two grand entrance halls, the eastern one for the [[Royal Saxon State Railways]] and the western one for the [[Prussian state railways]].\n\nIn the 19th century, Leipzig was a centre of the German and Saxon liberal movements. The first German [[List of Labour Parties|labor party]], the [[General German Workers' Association]] (''Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein'', ADAV) was founded in Leipzig on 23 May 1863 by [[Ferdinand Lassalle]]; about 600 workers from across Germany travelled to the foundation on the new railway. Leipzig expanded rapidly to more than 700,000 inhabitants. Huge ''[[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]]'' areas were built, which mostly survived both war and post-war demolition.\n[[File:Leipzig um 1900.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Augustusplatz with [[Leipzig Opera]] House, around 1900]]\n\n===20th century===\n{{See also|History of Leipzig from 1933-1939|Bombing of Leipzig in World War II|University of Music and Theatre Leipzig}}\n\nWith the opening of a fifth production hall in 1907, the [[Leipziger Baumwollspinnerei]] became the largest [[cotton mill]] company on the continent, housing over 240,000 spindles.

Beginning in 1933 and increasing in 1939, Jewish business owners were forced to give up their possessions and stores. This eventually intensified to the point where Nazi officials were strong enough to evict the Jews from their own homes. They also had the power to force many of the [[Jews]] living in the city to sell their houses. Many people who sold their homes emigrated elsewhere, outside of Leipzig.

Due to the close proximity of many of the buildings hit, a firestorm occurred. This prompted firefighters to rush to the city; however, the storm was too overwhelming for them. Unlike its neighbouring city of [[Dresden]], this was a largely conventional bombing with high explosives rather than incendiaries. The resultant pattern of loss was a patchwork, rather than wholesale loss of its centre, but was nevertheless extensive.\n\nThe Allied ground advance into [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] reached Leipzig in late April 1945. The U.S. [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] and U.S. [[69th Infantry Division (United States)|69th Infantry Division]] fought their way into the city on 18 April and completed its capture after fierce urban action, in which fighting was often house-to-house and block-to-block, on 19 April 1945.<ref>Stanton, Shelby, ''World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939\u20131946'' (Revised Edition, 2006), Stackpole Books, p. 78, 139.</ref> In April 1945 the SS Gruppehfuhrer/Mayor of Leipzig Bruno Erich Alfred Freyberg, his wife and daughter; the Deputy Mayor/Treasurer of Leipzig, Ernest Kurt Lisso, his wife, daughter, and a [[Volkssturm]] Major Walter D\u00f6nicke committed suicide in Leipzig City Hall.\n\nThe United States turned the city over to the [[Red Army]] as it pulled back from the [[line of contact]] with Soviet forces in July 1945 to the designated occupation zone boundaries.

At this time, trade fairs were held at a site in the south of the city, near the [[Monument to the Battle of the Nations]].\n\nThe planned economy of the German Democratic Republic, however, was not kind to Leipzig. Before the Second World War, Leipzig had developed a mixture of industry, creative business (notably publishing), and services (including legal services). During the period of the German Democratic Republic, services became the concern of the state, concentrated in (East) Berlin; creative business moved to West Germany; and Leipzig was left only with heavy industry. To make bad worse, this industry was extremely polluting, making Leipzig an even less attractive city to live in.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://theprotocity.com/leipzig-back-growth-everyone/|title=Leipzig: Back to Growth, but Not for Everyone|date=2014-08-25|website=TheProtoCity.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref> Between 1950 and the end of the German Democratic Republic, the population of Leipzig fell from 600,000 to 500,000.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/67845/1/casereport107.pdf|title=Leipzig City Story|last=Power|first=Anne and Elineen Herden|date=May 2016|website=LSE Housing and Communities|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn October 1989, after [[prayer]]s for peace at [[St. Nicholas Church, Leipzig|St.&nbsp;Nicholas Church]], established in 1983 as part of the peace movement, the [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|Monday demonstrations]] started as the most prominent mass protest against the [[Government of East Germany|East German government]].<ref>David Brebis (ed.), ''Michelin guide to Germany'', Greenville (2006), p. 324.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8297630.stm|title=The day I outflanked the Stasi|publisher=BBC|date=9 October 2009}} + video.</ref> The [[reunification of Germany]], however, was at first not good for Leipzig.

There are also several [[Baroque architecture|baroque period]] trading houses and former residences of rich merchants. As Leipzig grew considerably during the economic boom of the late-nineteenth century, the town has many buildings in the [[Historicism (art)|historicist style]] representative of the ''[[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]]'' era. Approximately 35% of Leipzig's flats are in buildings of this type. The [[New Town Hall (Leipzig)|new city hall]], completed in 1905, is built in the same style.\n\nSome 64,000 apartments in Leipzig were built in [[Plattenbau]] buildings during Communist rule in East Germany.<ref>[[:de:Liste der Plattenbausiedlungen in Sachsen#Leipzig]]</ref> and although some of these have been demolished and the numbers living in this type of accommodation have declined in recent years, at least 10% of Leipzig's population (50,000 people) are still living in Plattenbau accommodation.<ref>[[:de:Plattenbauten in Leipzig]]</ref> Gr\u00fcnau, for example, has approximately 40,000 people living in this sort of accommodation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leipzig.de/gruenau/|title=Leipzig-Gr\u00fcnau|work=leipzig.de}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Paulinerkirche, Leipzig|St. Paul's Church]] was destroyed by the Communist government in 1968 to make room for a new main building for the university. After some debate, the city decided to establish a new, mainly secular building at the same location, called [[Paulinum (University of Leipzig)|Paulinum]], which was completed in 2012. Its architecture alludes to the look of the former church and it includes space for religious use by the faculty of theology, including the original altar from the old church and two newly built organs.\n\nMany commercial buildings were built in the 1990s as a result of tax breaks after German reunification.\n\n===Tallest buildings and structures===\nThe tallest structure in Leipzig is the chimney of the Stahl- und Hartgusswerk B\u00f6sdorf GmbH with a height of {{convert|205|m|ft|abbr=off}}.

After the [[Reunification of Germany]], immense efforts to restore and expand the traffic network have been undertaken and left the city area with an excellent infrastructure.\n\n===Rail===\n\n[[File:Bahnhof Leipzig von Panorama Tower 2013.jpg|thumb|right|[[Leipzig Hauptbahnhof]] is the main hub of tram and rail network and the world's largest railway station by floor area.]]\n[[File:Leipziger Bahnhof (228148125).jpeg|thumb|right|Inside Leipzig main station.]]\nOpened in 1915, [[Leipzig Central Station]] is the largest overhead railway station in Europe in terms of its built-up area. At the same time, it is an important supra-regional junction in the ICE and [[Intercity (Deutsche Bahn)|Intercity]] network of the [[Deutsche Bahn]] as well as a connection point for [[S-Bahn]] and regional traffic in the Halle/Leipzig area.\n\nIn Leipzig, the Intercity Express routes (Hamburg-)Berlin-Leipzig-Nuremberg-Munich and Dresden-Leipzig-Erfurt-Frankfurt am Main-(Wiesbaden/Saarbr\u00fccken) intersect. After completion of the high-speed line to Erfurt, the ICE will run on both lines via [[Leipzig/Halle Airport]] and Erfurt. Leipzig is also the starting point for the intercity lines Leipzig-Halle (Saale)-Magdeburg-Braunschweig-Hannover-Dortmund-K\u00f6ln and -Bremen-Oldenburg(-Norddeich Mole). Both lines complement each other at hourly intervals and also stop at Leipzig/Halle Airport. The only international connection is the daily EuroCity Leipzig-Prague.\n\nMost major and medium-sized towns in Saxony and southern Saxony-Anhalt can be reached without changing trains. There are also direct connections via regional express lines to Falkenberg/Elster-Cottbus, Hoyerswerda and Dessau-Magdeburg as well as Chemnitz. Neighbouring Halle (Saale) can be reached via two S-Bahn lines, one of which runs hourly via Leipzig/Halle Airport. The surrounding area of Leipzig is served by numerous regional and S-Bahn lines.\n\nThe city's rail connections are currently being greatly improved by major construction projects, particularly within the framework of the German Unity transport projects. The line to Berlin has been extended and has been passable at 200&nbsp;km/h since 2006. On 13 December 2015, the high-speed line from Leipzig to Erfurt, designed for 300&nbsp;km/h, was put into operation. Its continuation to Nuremberg is scheduled for completion in December 2017. This integration into the high-speed network will considerably reduce the journey times of the ICE from Leipzig to Nuremberg, Munich and Frankfurt am Main. The Leipzig-Dresden railway line, which was the first German long-distance railway to go into operation in 1839, is also undergoing expansion for 200&nbsp;km/h. The ICE will also be able to operate from Leipzig to Dresden in the near future. The most important construction project in regional transport was the four-kilometer-long [[City-Tunnel (Leipzig)|City Tunnel]], which went into operation in December 2013 as the main line of the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]].\n\nFor freight traffic, there are freight stations in the districts of Wahren and Engelsdorf. In addition, a large freight traffic centre has been set up near the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction for goods handling between road and rail, as well as a freight station on the site of the DHL hub at Leipzig/Halle Airport.\n\n===Suburban train===\n\n{{see also|S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland}}\n[[File:S-Bahn - City-Tunnel Leipzig mit BR 182 und Doppelstockwagen (HP Markt).jpg|thumb|right|Trains of S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland at [[Leipzig Markt station]].]]\nLeipzig is the core of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland line network. Together with the tram, six of the ten lines form the backbone of local public transport and an important link to the region and the neighbouring Halle. The main line of the S-Bahn consists of the underground S-Bahn stations Hauptbahnhof, Markt, Wilhelm-Leuschner-Platz and [[Bayerischer Bahnhof]] leading through the City Tunnel as well as the above-ground station Leipzig MDR. There are a total of 30 S-Bahn stations in the Leipzig city area. Endpoints of the S-Bahn lines include Oschatz, Zwickau, Geithain and Bitterfeld. Two lines run to Halle, one of them via Leipzig/Halle Airport. In 2015, the network will be extended to Dessau and Lutherstadt Wittenberg.\n\nWith the timetable change in December 2004, the networks of Leipzig and Halle were combined to form the Leipzig-Halle S-Bahn. However, this network only served as a transitional solution and was replaced by the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland on 15 December 2013. At the same time, the main line tunnel, marketed as the Leipzig City Tunnel, went into operation. The tunnel, which is almost four kilometres long, crosses the entire city centre from the main railway station to the Bavarian railway station. The S-Bahn stations are up to 22 metres underground. This construction was the first to create a continuous north\u2013south axis, which had not existed until now due to the north-facing terminus station. The connection to the south of the city and the federal state will thus be greatly improved.\n\n===Tramway and Buses===\n\n{{see also|Trams in Leipzig}}\n[[File:Leipzig Tram 2017.jpg|thumb|right|Tram at [[Goerdelerring]].]]\nThe [[Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe]], existing since 1 January 1917, operate a total of 13 tram lines and 51 bus lines in the city.\n\nThe total length of the tram network is {{cvt|149.9|km}}, making it the largest in Saxony ({{cvt|130.2|km}}) ahead of Dresden and the second largest in Germany ({{cvt|193.6|km}} after Berlin). The longest line in the Leipzig network is line 11, which connects Schkeuditz with Markkleeberg over 22 kilometres and is the only tram line in Leipzig to run in three tariff zones of the Central German Transport Association.\n\nNight bus lines N1 to N9 and the night tram N17 operate in the night traffic. On Saturdays, Sundays and holidays the tram line N10 and the bus line N60 also operate. The central transfer point between the bus and tram lines as well as to the S-Bahn is Leipzig Central Station.\n\n===Bicycle===\n\nLike most German cities, Leipzig has a traffic layout designed to be [[bicycle-friendly]]. There is an extensive cycle network. In most of the one-way central streets, cyclists are explicitly allowed to cycle both ways. A few cycle paths have been built or declared since 1990.\n\nSince 2004 there is a [[bicycle-sharing system]]. Bikes can be borrowed and returned via smartphone app or by telephone. Since 2018, the system has enabled flexible borrowing and returning of bicycles in the inner city; in this zone, bicycles can be handed in and borrowed from almost any street corner. Outside these zones, there are stations where the bikes are waiting. The current locations of the bikes can be seen via the app. There are cooperation offers with the Leipzig public transport companies and car sharing in order to offer as complete a mobility chain as possible.\n\n===Road===\n\n[[File:Mitteldeutsche-Schleife.png|thumb|Leipzig's road network]]\n[[File:Leipzig-Halle Airport Check-in.jpg|thumb|[[Leipzig/Halle Airport]], hub of [[DHL Express|DHL]]]]\n\nSeveral federal motorways pass by Leipzig: the [[Bundesautobahn 14|A 14]] in the north, the [[Bundesautobahn 9|A 9]] in the west and the [[Bundesautobahn 38|A 38]] in the south. The three motorways form a triangular partial ring of the double ring Mitteldeutsche Schleife around Halle and Leipzig. To the south towards Chemnitz, the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A 72]] is also partly under construction or being planned.\n\nThe [[Bundesstra\u00dfe|federal roads]] [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 2|B 2]], [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 6|B 6]], [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 87|B 87]], [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 181|B 181]], [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 184|B 184]] and [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 186|B 186]] lead through the city area.\n\nThe ring, which corresponds to the course of the old city fortification, surrounds the city centre of Leipzig, which today is largely traffic-calmed.\n\nLeipzig has a dense network of [[carsharing]] stations. Additionally, since 2018 there is also a stationless car sharing system in Leipzig. Here the cars can be parked and booked anywhere in the inner city without having to define a specific car or period in advance. Finding and booking is done via a smartphone app.\n\nApart from the usual taxi traffic, Leipzig is one of the few cities in Germany with a [[Transportation network company|ridesharing provider]]. Taxi-like rides can be booked via an app. However, in contrast to a taxi, the start and destination must be defined beforehand and other passengers can be taken along at the same time if they share a route.\n\n===Long-distance buses===\n\nSince March 2018 there has been a central bus station directly east of Leipzig Central Station.\n\nIn addition to a large number of national lines, several international lines also serve Leipzig. The cities of Bregenz, Budapest, Milan, Prague, Sofia and Zurich, among others, can be reached without having to change trains. Around 30,000 journeys and 1.5&nbsp;million passengers a year are expected at the new bus station.\n\nSome lines also use Leipzig/Halle Airport, located at the A 9/A 14 motorway junction, and [[Leipziger Messe]] for a stop. Passengers can take the S-Bahn from there to the city centre.\n\n===Air===\n\n[[Leipzig/Halle Airport]] is the international commercial airport of the region. It is located at the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction northwest of Leipzig, halfway between the two major cities. The easternmost section of the new Erfurt-Leipzig/Halle line under construction gave the airport a long-distance railway station, which was also integrated into the ICE network when the railway line was completed in 2015.\n\nPassenger flights are operated to the major German hub airports, European metropolises and holiday destinations, especially in the Mediterranean region and North Africa. The airport is of international importance in the cargo sector. In Germany, it ranks second behind Frankfurt am Main, fifth in Europe and 26th worldwide (as of 2011). [[DHL]] uses the airport as its central European hub. It is also the home base of the freight airlines [[Aerologic]] and [[European Air Transport Leipzig]].\n\nThe former military airport near [[Altenburg]], [[Thuringia]] called [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]] about a half-hour drive from Leipzig was served by [[Ryanair]] until 2010.\n\n===Water===\n\n[[File:Leipzig - Elsterflutbett + Palmengartenwehr 01 ies.jpg|thumb|Boats at the [[White Elster|Elsterflutbett]]]]\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the construction of the [[Elster-Saale canal]], [[White Elster]] and [[Saale]] was started in Leipzig in order to connect to the network of waterways. The outbreak of the Second World War stopped most of the work, though some may have continued through the use of [[forced labor]]. The [[Lindenauer port]] was almost completed but not yet connected to the Elster-Saale and [[Karl-Heine canal]] respectively. The Leipzig rivers ([[White Elster]], [[Neue Luppe|New Luppe]], [[Plei\u00dfe]], and [[Parthe]]) in the city have largely artificial river beds and are supplemented by some channels. These waterways are suitable only for small leisure boat traffic.\n\nThrough the renovation and reconstruction of existing [[mill race]]s and watercourses in the south of the city and flooded disused [[open cast mines]], the city's navigable water network is being expanded. The city commissioned planning for a link between Karl Heine Canal and the disused Lindenauer port in 2008. Still more work was scheduled to complete the Elster-Saale canal. Such a move would allow small boats to reach the [[Elbe]] from Leipzig. The intended completion date has been postponed because of an unacceptable cost-benefit ratio.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Leipzig NGT12-LEI Waldplatz defekt.jpg|Tram of [[Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe]]\nFile:Leipzig Georg-Schumann-Strasse.jpg|Tramsystem at the Georg-Schumann-Stra\u00dfe\nFile:S-Bahnhof Leipzig Markt.jpg|[[Leipzig City Tunnel]], part of Leipzig's new [[S-Bahn]] network\nFile:S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland.
