Maithili is also one of the names of [[Sita]], the wife of King [[Rama]] and daughter of King [[Janaka]]. Scholars in Mithila used Sanskrit for their literary work and Maithili was the language of the common folk ([[Abahatta]]).\n\nThe beginning of Maithili language and literature can be traced back to the '[[Charyapada|Charyapadas]]', a form of Buddhist mystical verses, composed during the period of 700-1300 AD. These padas were written in [[Twilight language|Sandhya bhasa]] by several Siddhas who belonged to [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] and were scattered throughout the territory of [[Assam]], [[Bengal]], [[Bihar]] and [[Odisha]]. Several of Siddas were from Mithila region such as Kanhapa, Sarhapa etc. Prominent scholars like [[Rahul Sankrityayan|Rahul Sankrityanan]], Subhadra Jha and [[Jayakant Mishra]] provided evidences and proved that the language of  [[Charyapada]] is ancient Maithili or proto Maithili.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.135722 |title=A History Of Maithili Literature |volume=1 |last=Mishra|first=J. |date=1949}}</ref>\nApart from Charyapadas, there has been rich tradition of folk culture, folk songs and which were popular among common folks of Mithila region.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nAfter the fall of [[Pala Empire|Pala]] rule, disappearance of [[Buddhism]], establishment of [[Karnatas of Mithila|Karn\u0101ta]] kings and patronage of Maithili under Harasimhadeva (1226\u20131324) of Karn\u0101ta dynasty dates back to the 14th century (around 1327 AD).

But the disturbed era did not produce any literature in Maithili until [[Vidyapati|Vidyapati Thakur]] (1360 to 1450), who was an epoch-making poet under the patronage of king Shiva Singh and his queen Lakhima Devi. He produced over 1,000 immortal songs in Maithili on the theme of love of Radha and Krishna and the domestic life of [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]] as well as on the subject of suffering of migrant labourers of Morang and their families; besides, he wrote a number of treaties in Sanskrit. His love-songs spread far and wide in no time and enchanted saints, poets and youth. [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] saw the divine light of love behind these songs, and soon these songs became themes of [[Vaishnavism|Vaisnava]] sect of [[Bengal]]. [[Rabindranath Tagore]], out of curiosity, imitated these songs under the pseudonym [[Bhanusimha Thakurer Padabali|Bhanusimha]]. Vidyapati influenced the religious literature of Asama, Bangal, Utkala and gave birth to a new [[Brajabuli]] language.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe earliest reference to Maithili or Tirhutiya is in Amaduzzi's preface to Beligatti's ''Alphabetum Brammhanicum'', published in 1771.<ref name=\"Tourutiana\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1Djfl_uZqLAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Tourutiana&f=false |last=Ded.

Maithili is also one of the names of [[Sita]], the wife of King [[Rama]] and daughter of King [[Janaka]]. Scholars in Mithila used Sanskrit for their literary work and Maithili was the language of the common folk ([[Abahatta]]).\n\nThe beginning of Maithili language and literature can be traced back to the '[[Charyapada|Charyapadas]]', a form of Buddhist mystical verses, composed during the period of 700-1300 AD. These padas were written in [[Twilight language|Sandhya bhasa]] by several Siddhas who belonged to [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] and were scattered throughout the territory of [[Assam]], [[Bengal]], [[Bihar]] and [[Odisha]]. Several of Siddas were from Mithila region such as Kanhapa, Sarhapa etc. Prominent scholars like [[Rahul Sankrityayan|Rahul Sankrityanan]], Subhadra Jha and [[Jayakant Mishra]] provided evidences and proved that the language of  [[Charyapada]] is ancient Maithili or proto Maithili.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.135722 |title=A History Of Maithili Literature |volume=1 |last=Mishra|first=J. |date=1949}}</ref>\nApart from Charyapadas, there has been rich tradition of folk culture, folk songs and which were popular among common folks of Mithila region.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nAfter the fall of [[Pala Empire|Pala]] rule, disappearance of [[Buddhism]], establishment of [[Karnatas of Mithila|Karn\u0101ta]] kings and patronage of Maithili under Harasimhadeva (1226\u20131324) of Karn\u0101ta dynasty dates back to the 14th century (around 1327 AD).

But the disturbed era did not produce any literature in Maithili until [[Vidyapati|Vidyapati Thakur]] (1360 to 1450), who was an epoch-making poet under the patronage of king Shiva Singh and his queen Lakhima Devi. He produced over 1,000 immortal songs in Maithili on the theme of love of Radha and Krishna and the domestic life of [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]] as well as on the subject of suffering of migrant labourers of Morang and their families; besides, he wrote a number of treaties in Sanskrit. His love-songs spread far and wide in no time and enchanted saints, poets and youth. [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] saw the divine light of love behind these songs, and soon these songs became themes of [[Vaishnavism|Vaisnava]] sect of [[Bengal]]. [[Rabindranath Tagore]], out of curiosity, imitated these songs under the pseudonym [[Bhanusimha Thakurer Padabali|Bhanusimha]]. Vidyapati influenced the religious literature of Asama, Bangal, Utkala and gave birth to a new [[Brajabuli]] language.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe earliest reference to Maithili or Tirhutiya is in Amaduzzi's preface to Beligatti's ''Alphabetum Brammhanicum'', published in 1771.<ref name=\"Tourutiana\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1Djfl_uZqLAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Tourutiana&f=false |last=Ded.

Back for his father's funeral, Luo recalls the death of an old friend, Wildcat, and searches for lost love Wan Qiwen ([[Tang Wei]]), who continues to haunt him.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Huang Jue]] as Luo Hongwu\n* [[Tang Wei]] as Wan Qiwen/Kaizhen\n* [[Sylvia Chang]] as Wildcat's Mom/Red-hair Woman\n* [[Lee Hong-chi]] as Wildcat\n* [[Chloe Maayan]] as Pager\n* [[Ming Dao]] as Traffic Police\n\n==Production==\n\nDirector Bi Gan enlisted novelist [[Chang Ta-chun|Chang Ta-Chun]] as a consultant for the script, noting that Ta-Chun aided in the overall film structure as well as the division of the film into two parts.  Of the two parts, Gan noted that \"the title of the first part is ''Memory''; that of the\nsecond is ''Poppy'', in reference to [[Paul Celan|Paul Celan\u2019s]] poem ''[[Poppy and Memory]]''. At some point, I even considered using this as the film\u2019s title.\"<ref name=\"Official Press Kit\">{{cite web |last1=Muyan |first1=Wang |title=Interview with Director Bi Gan |url=https://encodeur.movidone.com/getimage/vRNnZaWLkplYJiWihZPRwI414x4KL41vPrShkbkGYFgkJAqaTG3Xm8kckJhvQynriXvSKVQpIkqMXukgYBfYP3fCxQd8KAa0ra0fmC23rkJNU2uiLniCGA_LUhjgqdRyKgGKuPPyM8K7D3pDrLkgLP57-ON9Jt0eePo-XEaIxcuaYYcpc4S_dM57XaBfpzIVVfV_YWXnAYLomGpZY6nkt-ss |website=wildbunch.biz |publisher=Wild Bunch |accessdate=14 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nGan stated that \u201cI liked the idea that the first half would be in 2D, because I wanted it to feel as fragmented as time, with little bits of memory... With the second half, I wanted it to be real-time, and the 3D was the best way to create a spacial experience for that.\u201d The 59-minute unbroken [[long take]] 3D sequence that closes the film took two months to prepare, as techniques had to be devised to move a [[Red Digital Cinema|RED 3D camera]] through the complicated environment of the scene. It took seven attempts at shooting the sequence before Bi was satisfied.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.indiewire.com/2018/12/bi-gan-long-days-journey-into-night-record-china-box-office-1202030671/ | title = \u2018Long Day\u2019s Journey Into Night\u2019 Director Had to Film His 59-Minute 3D Long Take Seven Times to Get It Just Right | last = Kohn | first =  Eric | date = 2 October 2018 | website = indiewire.com | access-date = 16 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn reference to the use of 2D and 3D, Gan said:\n{{Quote|text=It\u2019s a film about memory. After the first part (in 2D), I wanted the film to take on a different texture. In fact, for me, 3D is simply a texture. Like a mirror that turns our memories into tactile sensations. It\u2019s just a three-dimensional representation of space. But I believe this three-dimensional feeling recalls that of our recollections of the past. Much more than 2D, anyway. 3D images are fake but they resemble our memories much more closely<ref name=\"Official Press Kit\" />.}}\n\nThe film is notable for utilizing three cinematographers - Yao Hung-I, Dong Jinsong, and David Chizallet.  Their individual roles were broken down by Gan, who stated that \"Yao Hung-I began shooting the first part. We worked together for several months and then he went back to Taiwan. Dong Jinsong then took over for half of the part in 2D and the preparation of the final sequence shot that David Chizallet eventually shot. Chizallet also shot one scene of the part in 2D<ref name=\"Official Press Kit\" />.\"\n\nGan stated that he had difficulty choosing a title for the film, noting that the official international title is \"Long Day's Journey into Night,\" a title inspired by the [[Long Day's Journey into Night|play of the same name]] by [[Eugene O'Neill|Eugene O'Neil]], whereas the direct Chinese translation is \"Last Evenings on Earth,\" which refers to [[Last Evenings on Earth|a short story]] written by Chilean author [[Roberto Bola\u00f1o|Roberto Bolano]].  Regarding the two titles, Gan noted that he wanted to choose titles that \"matched with the film's spirit\" and that he ultimately chose them because they related to two works of literature he admired.<ref name=\"Official Press Kit\" />\n\nGan drew inspiration for the film from the paintings of [[Marc Chagall]], specifically ''The Promenade'', as well as the novels of [[Patrick Modiano]]<ref name=\"Official Press Kit\" />.

Of the two parts, Gan noted that \"the title of the first part is ''Memory''; that of the\nsecond is ''Poppy'', in reference to [[Paul Celan|Paul Celan\u2019s]] poem ''[[Poppy and Memory]]''. At some point, I even considered using this as the film\u2019s title.\"<ref name=\"Official Press Kit\">{{cite web |last1=Muyan |first1=Wang |title=Interview with Director Bi Gan |url=https://encodeur.movidone.com/getimage/vRNnZaWLkplYJiWihZPRwI414x4KL41vPrShkbkGYFgkJAqaTG3Xm8kckJhvQynriXvSKVQpIkqMXukgYBfYP3fCxQd8KAa0ra0fmC23rkJNU2uiLniCGA_LUhjgqdRyKgGKuPPyM8K7D3pDrLkgLP57-ON9Jt0eePo-XEaIxcuaYYcpc4S_dM57XaBfpzIVVfV_YWXnAYLomGpZY6nkt-ss |website=wildbunch.biz |publisher=Wild Bunch |accessdate=14 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nGan stated that \u201cI liked the idea that the first half would be in 2D, because I wanted it to feel as fragmented as time, with little bits of memory... With the second half, I wanted it to be real-time, and the 3D was the best way to create a spacial experience for that.\u201d The 59-minute unbroken [[long take]] 3D sequence that closes the film took two months to prepare, as techniques had to be devised to move a [[Red Digital Cinema|RED 3D camera]] through the complicated environment of the scene. It took seven attempts at shooting the sequence before Bi was satisfied.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.indiewire.com/2018/12/bi-gan-long-days-journey-into-night-record-china-box-office-1202030671/ | title = \u2018Long Day\u2019s Journey Into Night\u2019 Director Had to Film His 59-Minute 3D Long Take Seven Times to Get It Just Right | last = Kohn | first =  Eric | date = 2 October 2018 | website = indiewire.com | access-date = 16 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn reference to the use of 2D and 3D, Gan said:\n{{Quote|text=It\u2019s a film about memory. After the first part (in 2D), I wanted the film to take on a different texture. In fact, for me, 3D is simply a texture. Like a mirror that turns our memories into tactile sensations. It\u2019s just a three-dimensional representation of space. But I believe this three-dimensional feeling recalls that of our recollections of the past. Much more than 2D, anyway. 3D images are fake but they resemble our memories much more closely<ref name=\"Official Press Kit\" />.}}\n\nThe film is notable for utilizing three cinematographers - Yao Hung-I, Dong Jinsong, and David Chizallet.  Their individual roles were broken down by Gan, who stated that \"Yao Hung-I began shooting the first part. We worked together for several months and then he went back to Taiwan. Dong Jinsong then took over for half of the part in 2D and the preparation of the final sequence shot that David Chizallet eventually shot. Chizallet also shot one scene of the part in 2D<ref name=\"Official Press Kit\" />.\"\n\nGan stated that he had difficulty choosing a title for the film, noting that the official international title is \"Long Day's Journey into Night,\" a title inspired by the [[Long Day's Journey into Night|play of the same name]] by [[Eugene O'Neill|Eugene O'Neil]], whereas the direct Chinese translation is \"Last Evenings on Earth,\" which refers to [[Last Evenings on Earth|a short story]] written by Chilean author [[Roberto Bola\u00f1o|Roberto Bolano]].  Regarding the two titles, Gan noted that he wanted to choose titles that \"matched with the film's spirit\" and that he ultimately chose them because they related to two works of literature he admired.<ref name=\"Official Press Kit\" />\n\nGan drew inspiration for the film from the paintings of [[Marc Chagall]], specifically ''The Promenade'', as well as the novels of [[Patrick Modiano]]<ref name=\"Official Press Kit\" />.

Most blisters are filled with a clear fluid, either serum or plasma.<ref name=\"blisterfluid\">{{cite journal|pmid=3358612|year=1988|last1=Uchinuma|first1=E|last2=Koganei|first2=Y|last3=Shioya|first3=N|last4=Yoshizato|first4=K|title=Biological evaluation of burn blister fluid|volume=20|issue=3|pages=225\u201330|journal=Annals of Plastic Surgery|doi=10.1097/00000637-198803000-00005}}</ref> However, blisters can be filled with blood (known as \"[[blood blister|blood blisters\"]]) or with pus (for instance, if they become infected).\n\nThe word \"blister\" entered English in the 14th century. It came from the [[Middle Dutch]] \"bluyster\" and was a modification of the [[Old French]] \"blostre\", which meant a leprous nodule\u2014a rise in the skin due to [[leprosy]]. In [[dermatology]] today, the words [[cutaneous condition#Vesicle|''vesicle'' and ''bulla'']] refer to blisters of smaller or greater size, respectively.\n\nTo heal properly, a blister should not be popped unless medically necessary. If popped, the excess skin should not be removed because the skin underneath needs that top layer to heal properly.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/understanding-blister-treatment|title=Blister Treatments and Prevention|work=WebMD|access-date=2017-03-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Causes==\n\nA blister may form when the skin has been damaged by [[friction]] or rubbing, heat, cold or chemical exposure. Fluid collects between the upper layers of [[skin]] (the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]) and the layers below (the [[dermis]]). This fluid cushions the tissue underneath, protecting it from further damage and allowing it to heal.\n\n===Friction or rubbing===\n[[File:Friction Blisters On Human Foot.jpg|thumb|Various sized blisters on the sole of a foot due to friction]]\nIntense rubbing can cause a blister, as can any friction on the skin if continued long enough. This kind of blister is most common after walking long distances or by wearing old or poorly fitting shoes.<ref name=\"Naylor1\">[Naylor PFD. \"The Skin Surface and Friction,\" ''[[British Journal of Dermatology]]''. 1955;67:239\u2013248.]</ref><ref name=\"Naylor2\">[Naylor PFD. \"Experimental Friction Blisters,\" British Journal of Dermatology. 1955;67:327\u2013342.]</ref><ref name=Sulzberger>[Sulzberger MB, Cortese TA, Fishman L, Wiley HS. \"Studies on Blisters Produced by Friction,\" Journal of Investigative Dermatology. 1966;47:456\u2013465.]</ref> Blisters are most common on the hands and feet, as these extremities are susceptible while walking, running, or performing repetitive motions, such as joystick manipulation whilst playing certain video games, digging with a shovel, playing guitar or bass, etc. Blisters form more easily on damp skin than on dry or soaked skin,<ref name=\"Carlson1\">[Carlson JM. \"The Friction Factor,\" OrthoKinetic Review. Nov/Dec 2001;1(7):1\u20133.]</ref> and are more common in warm conditions. Less-aggressive rubbing over long periods of time may cause [[calluses]] to form rather than a blister.

The most common are [[chickenpox]], [[herpes simplex|herpes]], [[impetigo]], and a form of [[eczema]] called [[dyshidrosis]]. Other, much rarer conditions that cause blisters include:\n\n* [[Bullous pemphigoid]]: a skin disease that causes large, tightly filled blisters to develop, usually affecting people over the age of 60.\n* [[Pemphigus]]: a serious skin disease in which blisters develop if pressure is applied to the skin; the blisters burst easily, leaving raw areas that can become infected.\n* [[Dermatitis herpetiformis]]: a skin disease that causes intensely itchy blisters, usually on the elbows, knees, back and buttocks. The blisters usually develop in patches of the same shape and size on both sides of the body.\n* Chronic bullous [[dermatosis]]: a disease that causes clusters of blisters on the face, mouth or genitals.\n* [[Cutaneous radiation syndrome]]\n* [[Epidermolysis bullosa]]\n\n==Pathophysiology==\n\n===Friction blisters===\nFriction blisters are caused by excess [[shear stress]] between the bottom and surface of the skin and the body. The strata of skin around the [[stratum spinosum]] are most susceptible to shear. As the stratum spinosum tears away from the connecting tissues below, plasma from the cells diffuses out. This plasma solution helps new cells divide and grow into new connective tissues and epidermal layers.\n\nThe clear fluid will be reabsorbed as new cells develop and the swollen appearance will subside. Painful blisters located on hands ([[Hand|palmar surface]]) and feet ([[Sole (foot)|plantar surface]]) are due to tissue shearing deeper in the epidermis, near nerve endings. Lower tissues are more susceptible to infection.\n\n==Prevention==\n\n===Friction blisters===\nFriction blisters, caused by rubbing against the skin, can be prevented by reducing the friction to a level where blisters will not form.<ref name=\"Naylor1\" /><ref name=\"Naylor2\" /><ref name=\"Sulzberger\" /><ref name=\"Hanna\">[Hanna T, Carlson JM. \"Freedom from Friction,\" OrthoKinetic Review.

Oars used for competitive rowing are known for causing frequent blisters on the hands of oarsmen.  Weightlifters are also prone to blisters as are gymnasts from the friction developed by the rubbing against the bars. To further reduce the occurrence one can tape the hands, and there are also a number of products on the market that claim to reduce the occurrence of blisters.

In [[dermatology]] today, the words [[cutaneous condition#Vesicle|''vesicle'' and ''bulla'']] refer to blisters of smaller or greater size, respectively.\n\nTo heal properly, a blister should not be popped unless medically necessary. If popped, the excess skin should not be removed because the skin underneath needs that top layer to heal properly.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/understanding-blister-treatment|title=Blister Treatments and Prevention|work=WebMD|access-date=2017-03-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Causes==\n\nA blister may form when the skin has been damaged by [[friction]] or rubbing, heat, cold or chemical exposure. Fluid collects between the upper layers of [[skin]] (the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]) and the layers below (the [[dermis]]). This fluid cushions the tissue underneath, protecting it from further damage and allowing it to heal.\n\n===Friction or rubbing===\n[[File:Friction Blisters On Human Foot.jpg|thumb|Various sized blisters on the sole of a foot due to friction]]\nIntense rubbing can cause a blister, as can any friction on the skin if continued long enough.

Richard III. act v, sc.3.</small>}}</center>\n\nThe [[medieval]] standard was usually about eight feet long, but [[Tudor period|Tudor]] [[herald]]s determined different lengths, according to the rank of the nobility. \"The Great Standard to be sette before the Kinges pavilion or tent \u2013 not to be borne in battle\" \u2013 was 33-foot long. A duke's standard was 21-foot in length, and that of the humble knight, 12-foot long. These standards, or personal flags, were displayed by armigerous commanders in battle, but mustering and rallying functions were performed by livery flags; notably the standard which bore the liveries and badges familiar to the retainers and soldiers, of which their uniforms were composed.<ref>Stephen Friar: ''Heraldry'' (1992), p.225. {{ISBN|0-7509-1085-2}}.</ref> The [[St George's Cross|St. George]] in the hoist of each standard was the communal symbol of national identity. This badge or banner of England, at the head of the standard, was the indication that the men assembled beneath it were first, Englishmen, and secondly, the followers of the man whose arms were continued on the standard.<ref>Charles Hassler: ''The Royal Arms'' (1980), p.31. {{ISBN|0-904041-20-4}}.</ref>\n\nThere were three main types of heraldic flag.<ref>Boutell's Heraldry (1973) {{ISBN|0723217084}}.</ref>\n* A '''pennon''' was small, pointed or swallow-tailed at the fly, charged with the badge or other armorial device of the knight who bore it.\n* A '''banner''' was square or oblong (depth greater than breadth), charged with the arms of the owner with no other device, borne by [[knight banneret]]s, ranking higher than other knights, and also by barons, princes and the sovereign.\n* A '''standard''' was a narrow and tapering (sometimes swallow-tailed) flag, of considerable length (depending on the rank of the owner), generally used only for pageantry, and particularly to display the supporter, badges and livery colours. Mottoes were often introduced bendwise across these standards.\n\n===Badges===\n[[File:White Hart Badge of Richard II.svg|150px|thumb|right|The [[White Hart|white hart]] badge of King [[Richard II]].]]\n{{Main|Royal Badges of England}}\n<center>{{cquote|''Might I but know thee by thy Household Badge''.....{{pad|1em}}<small>Shakespeare. 2 Henry VI, V. i</small>}}</center>\n[[Heraldic badge|Badges]] may possibly have preceded [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]]s. The Norman kings and their sons may have originally used lions as badges of kingship. The lion was a Royal Badge long before heraldic records, as [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] gave a shield of golden lions to his son-in-law [[Geoffrey of Anjou]] in 1127.\n\nThe seals of [[William II of England|William II]] and [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] included many devices regarded as badges. [[Stephen of England|Stephen I]] used a ''sagittary'' (centaur) as a badge. Badges were widely used and borne by the first five [[Plantagenet]]s, notably the ''planta genista'' (broom plant) from which their name derived; a star and crescent interpreted by some as a sun and moon; the ''genet'' of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]; the rose and thistle of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]]; the white hart of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]; the [[Tudor rose]] and [[portcullis]]. The [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]] were the last to bear personal badges, ceasing with [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]]; the [[Royal Badges of England|royal badges]] afterward became more akin to national emblems, evolving into our modern versions.<ref>Charles Hasler: ''The Royal Arms'', pp.3\u201311. {{ISBN|0-904041-20-4}}.</ref>\n\nAll sorts of devices were used on standards, generally a beast badge, a plant badge or instead of the latter a simple object (such as a knot). Sometimes the crest was used, but invariably the largest and most dominant object on a standard was one of the supporters. The whole banner was usually fringed with the livery colours, giving the effect of the ''[[bordure]] [[compony]]''.  Except in funerals, these standards were not used after the [[Tudor period]], probably because of the creation of a [[standing army]] in the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].<ref>[[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies|A.C. Fox-Davies]]: ''[[The Art of Heraldry: An Encyclop\u00e6dia of Armory|The Art of Heraldry]]'' (1904/1986). {{ISBN|0-906223-34-2}}.</ref>\n\n===Supporters===\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Henry VII of England (1485-1509).svg|250px|thumb|right|Coat of arms of King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], depicting both the [[Welsh Dragon|red dragon]] and the [[White Greyhound of Richmond|white greyhound]] as supporters.]]\n{{main|Royal Supporters of England}}\n\n[[Supporters]] are figures of living creatures each side of an armorial shield, appearing to support it. The origin of supporters can be traced to their usages in tournaments, on Standards, and where the shields of the combatants were exposed for inspection. Medieval Scottish seals afford numerous examples in which the 13th and 14th century shields were placed between two creatures resembling lizards or dragons. The Royal Supporters of the monarchs of England are a menagerie of real and imaginary beasts, including the lion, leopard, panther, and tiger, the antelope, greyhound, a cock and bull, eagle, red and gold dragons, and since 1603 the current unicorn.<ref>A.C. Fox-Davies: ''The Art of Heraldry'' (1904/1986), chapter XXX, p.300. {{ISBN|0-906223-34-2}}.</ref>\n\n===Livery colours===\nThe term [[livery]] is derived from the French ''livr\u00e9e'' from the [[Latin]] ''liberare'', meaning to liberate or bestow, originally implying the dispensing of food, provisions and clothing &c to retainers. In the [[Middle Ages]] the term was then applied to the uniforms and other devices, worn by those who accepted the privileges and obligations of ''embracery'', or livery and maintenance.<ref>Friar. p.216.</ref> The royal liveries of the later [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]]s were white and red; those of the [[House of Lancaster]] were white and blue, the colours of the [[House of York]] were murrey (dark red) and blue. The liveries of the [[House of Tudor]] were white and green; those of the [[House of Stuart]] \u2013 and of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] \u2013 were yellow and red. In all subsequent reigns, they have been scarlet and blue.\n\n===Motto===\n{{Main|Dieu et mon droit}}\n'''Dieu et mon droit''' (originally ''Dieu et mon droyt''; French: 'God and my right'), as seen on Royal standards since [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]], is said to have first been adopted as the royal motto by [[Henry V of England|King Henry V]] in the 15th century, and consistently so used by most later English (and British) kings, with few exceptions.

(p252). {{ISBN|0-7232-1708-4}}.</ref>\n\nThe standard was equivalent to the modern headquarters flag and played a significant role in the medieval army. Beneath it was pitched the tent of the leader; behind it his retainers would follow; around it they would gather after a charge to regroup; under it they would make their last stand in battle. During the Tudor period the standing army came into being and the standard ceased to be use as an instrument of war.

Richard III. act v, sc.3.</small>}}</center>\n\nThe [[medieval]] standard was usually about eight feet long, but [[Tudor period|Tudor]] [[herald]]s determined different lengths, according to the rank of the nobility. \"The Great Standard to be sette before the Kinges pavilion or tent \u2013 not to be borne in battle\" \u2013 was 33-foot long. A duke's standard was 21-foot in length, and that of the humble knight, 12-foot long. These standards, or personal flags, were displayed by armigerous commanders in battle, but mustering and rallying functions were performed by livery flags; notably the standard which bore the liveries and badges familiar to the retainers and soldiers, of which their uniforms were composed.<ref>Stephen Friar: ''Heraldry'' (1992), p.225. {{ISBN|0-7509-1085-2}}.</ref> The [[St George's Cross|St. George]] in the hoist of each standard was the communal symbol of national identity. This badge or banner of England, at the head of the standard, was the indication that the men assembled beneath it were first, Englishmen, and secondly, the followers of the man whose arms were continued on the standard.<ref>Charles Hassler: ''The Royal Arms'' (1980), p.31. {{ISBN|0-904041-20-4}}.</ref>\n\nThere were three main types of heraldic flag.<ref>Boutell's Heraldry (1973) {{ISBN|0723217084}}.</ref>\n* A '''pennon''' was small, pointed or swallow-tailed at the fly, charged with the badge or other armorial device of the knight who bore it.\n* A '''banner''' was square or oblong (depth greater than breadth), charged with the arms of the owner with no other device, borne by [[knight banneret]]s, ranking higher than other knights, and also by barons, princes and the sovereign.\n* A '''standard''' was a narrow and tapering (sometimes swallow-tailed) flag, of considerable length (depending on the rank of the owner), generally used only for pageantry, and particularly to display the supporter, badges and livery colours. Mottoes were often introduced bendwise across these standards.\n\n===Badges===\n[[File:White Hart Badge of Richard II.svg|150px|thumb|right|The [[White Hart|white hart]] badge of King [[Richard II]].]]\n{{Main|Royal Badges of England}}\n<center>{{cquote|''Might I but know thee by thy Household Badge''.....{{pad|1em}}<small>Shakespeare. 2 Henry VI, V. i</small>}}</center>\n[[Heraldic badge|Badges]] may possibly have preceded [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]]s. The Norman kings and their sons may have originally used lions as badges of kingship. The lion was a Royal Badge long before heraldic records, as [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] gave a shield of golden lions to his son-in-law [[Geoffrey of Anjou]] in 1127.\n\nThe seals of [[William II of England|William II]] and [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] included many devices regarded as badges. [[Stephen of England|Stephen I]] used a ''sagittary'' (centaur) as a badge. Badges were widely used and borne by the first five [[Plantagenet]]s, notably the ''planta genista'' (broom plant) from which their name derived; a star and crescent interpreted by some as a sun and moon; the ''genet'' of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]; the rose and thistle of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]]; the white hart of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]; the [[Tudor rose]] and [[portcullis]]. The [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]] were the last to bear personal badges, ceasing with [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]]; the [[Royal Badges of England|royal badges]] afterward became more akin to national emblems, evolving into our modern versions.<ref>Charles Hasler: ''The Royal Arms'', pp.3\u201311. {{ISBN|0-904041-20-4}}.</ref>\n\nAll sorts of devices were used on standards, generally a beast badge, a plant badge or instead of the latter a simple object (such as a knot). Sometimes the crest was used, but invariably the largest and most dominant object on a standard was one of the supporters. The whole banner was usually fringed with the livery colours, giving the effect of the ''[[bordure]] [[compony]]''.  Except in funerals, these standards were not used after the [[Tudor period]], probably because of the creation of a [[standing army]] in the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].<ref>[[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies|A.C. Fox-Davies]]: ''[[The Art of Heraldry: An Encyclop\u00e6dia of Armory|The Art of Heraldry]]'' (1904/1986). {{ISBN|0-906223-34-2}}.</ref>\n\n===Supporters===\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Henry VII of England (1485-1509).svg|250px|thumb|right|Coat of arms of King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], depicting both the [[Welsh Dragon|red dragon]] and the [[White Greyhound of Richmond|white greyhound]] as supporters.]]\n{{main|Royal Supporters of England}}\n\n[[Supporters]] are figures of living creatures each side of an armorial shield, appearing to support it. The origin of supporters can be traced to their usages in tournaments, on Standards, and where the shields of the combatants were exposed for inspection. Medieval Scottish seals afford numerous examples in which the 13th and 14th century shields were placed between two creatures resembling lizards or dragons. The Royal Supporters of the monarchs of England are a menagerie of real and imaginary beasts, including the lion, leopard, panther, and tiger, the antelope, greyhound, a cock and bull, eagle, red and gold dragons, and since 1603 the current unicorn.<ref>A.C. Fox-Davies: ''The Art of Heraldry'' (1904/1986), chapter XXX, p.300. {{ISBN|0-906223-34-2}}.</ref>\n\n===Livery colours===\nThe term [[livery]] is derived from the French ''livr\u00e9e'' from the [[Latin]] ''liberare'', meaning to liberate or bestow, originally implying the dispensing of food, provisions and clothing &c to retainers. In the [[Middle Ages]] the term was then applied to the uniforms and other devices, worn by those who accepted the privileges and obligations of ''embracery'', or livery and maintenance.<ref>Friar. p.216.</ref> The royal liveries of the later [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]]s were white and red; those of the [[House of Lancaster]] were white and blue, the colours of the [[House of York]] were murrey (dark red) and blue. The liveries of the [[House of Tudor]] were white and green; those of the [[House of Stuart]] \u2013 and of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] \u2013 were yellow and red. In all subsequent reigns, they have been scarlet and blue.\n\n===Motto===\n{{Main|Dieu et mon droit}}\n'''Dieu et mon droit''' (originally ''Dieu et mon droyt''; French: 'God and my right'), as seen on Royal standards since [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]], is said to have first been adopted as the royal motto by [[Henry V of England|King Henry V]] in the 15th century, and consistently so used by most later English (and British) kings, with few exceptions.

According to the 19th century Franciscan friar and historian [[Donato Fabianich]], the monastery of [[St. Catharines|Saint Catherine]] was founded around this time by the Knin dignitaries and nobility which were first settled there by Mladen \u0160ubi\u0107.<ref>Donato Fabianich, Storia dei fratri minori dai primordi della joro istituzione in Dal\u00b7 mazia e Bossina, fino ai giorni nostri, I, Zadar 1863, pp. 94.</ref> Their rule over Knin came to an end at the [[Battle of Bliska]] in 1322, after which the Angevin king [[Charles I of Hungary|Charles Robert]] arrived in the city and imprisoned the former lord [[Mladen II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir]].{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=35}} Upon the departure of the king to Hungary, the noble [[Ivan Nelipi\u0107]] quickly seized Knin, and from there expelled the king's men from Croatia.

The previous bishop had likely been expelled, where the [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] Mihailo took his place, and was also given the office of the king's chancellor. These actions provoked a retaliation of king [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], whose armies besieged Knin in September 1390. The city, along with other territories were returned to Sigismund in 1393. Upon his return from the disastrous [[battle of Nicopolis]] in 1396, the king spent a month in Knin to consolidate his holdings and state affairs of Dalmatia and Croatia, issuing various decrees together with his ban [[Nicholas II Garai|Nikola Gorjanski]].{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=60}} In 1401, the city was besieged by the Bosnian king [[Stephen Ostoja]], who encamped in the adjacent Knin field (Kninsko polje), and remained there until the following year. The newly crowned king [[Ladislaus of Naples]] attained support from the castellan of Knin and issued his first decree there in 1403.\n\nBecause of frequent harassment, the citizens of Knin had to pay tribute to the duke [[Hrvoje Vuk\u010di\u0107 Hrvatini\u0107]], and for a short while, the city seemed to have been directly under his rule. The presence of [[Franciscans]] is for the first time mentioned in the 15th century, which were located in the old Saint Mary's church and monastery in the city. Apart from them, other religious buildings are mentioned such as the church of the [[Holy Spirit]].<ref name=\"academia.edu\"/>\n\nIts strategic position played an important role in many wars and power changes \u2013 the Republic of Venice often reflected on its importance as a key castle and the main entrance to Dalmatia, which it attempted to obtain during the 15th century.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=64}} During these years both the city, the ban and his dignitaries played a crucial role in the struggle for dominance over the coastal cities with Venice. In 1430 Knin and the Church of St. Bartolomeo in Kapitul were the centre of the \"Union and Brotherhood of the Croats\" ({{lang-la|unio et fraternitas Croatorum}}), a congregation of [[Croatian nobility|Croatian nobles]] formed by 12 [[counties of Croatia]] in order to \"preserve the fame and old customs of the Croatian Kingdom\".<ref>Mladen An\u010di\u0107: \"Desetlje\u0107e od 1091. do 1102. u zrcalu vrela\" (Summary: The decade between 1091 and 1102 according to the sources), Povijesni prilozi 17/1998, p. 253</ref><ref>Damir Karbi\u0107: Hrvatski plemi\u0107ki rod i obi\u010dajno pravo, p. 109-111</ref>\n\nIt was in 1420 that the Nelipi\u0107 noble family again regained their former role in Croatia with the emergence of [[Ivani\u0161 Nelipi\u0107]], which again distanced these territories from the crown. These possessions were later acquired after Ivani\u0161's death in 1435 by [[Ivan Frankopan|An\u017e]] of the [[House of Frankopan]] through the marriage with the Nelipi\u0107 nobles. Knin and the surrounding possessions were restored to the crown upon An\u017e's death in 1437.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=68}} In 1454 an attempt between the Bosnian king and the Venetians was made to acquire the city, which was referenced as \"capital and foremost place of Croatia\" in their letters.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=72}}\n\nDuring the reign of king [[Matthias Corvinus]], the bishops of Knin were selected as the king's principal orators abroad in collecting the help needed against the invading [[Ottoman Empire]]. The bishop was thus first secretly involved at the [[pope]] to solicit financial aid for Matthias' military campaign. The city's distant surroundings quickly became a target for Ottoman raids. As the raids were becoming more frequent, one of them reached Knin, where a Franciscan monastery has been recorded to have been destroyed in 1469.\n\nIn 1493, the first direct attempt of siege by the Ottomans was undertaken, which was followed by ban [[John Corvinus]] and his deputies invading and pillaging the Ottoman territories from the city. The Republic of Venice started to financially support the city's defences in fear for its possessions in Dalmatia. In 1501, three Ottoman spies were caught and imprisoned by the vice-ban. They were sent by the [[Sanjak of Bosnia|Sanjak-bey of Bosnia]], and had infiltrated Knin posing as friars that were on their way to sell [[vestment]]s to the market. They were to investigate the situation in the Zadar surrounding.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=82}}\n\n[[File:KninPagano1525.png|thumb|right|280px|Knin castle, settlement and Kapitul around 1525, after Ottoman conquest from the map of Dalmatia from [[Matteo Pagano]]]]\nThe last major conflict around Knin before the truce was in September 1502 when 2,000 Ottoman cavalrymen looted the area.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=84}} On 20 August 1503 King [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislaus II]] concluded a 7-year peace treaty with Sultan [[Bayezid II]].

A period of severe famine started in 1505 that affected entire Dalmatia. In 1510 the plague halved Knin's population.\n\nIn 1510 around 1,000 Ottoman [[Ak\u0131nc\u0131]] raided the countryside of Knin. There had been word that viceban of Croatia was captured on that occasion. Baltazar Ba\u0107an ({{lang-hu|Boldizs\u00e1r Batthy\u00e1ny}}), viceban of Slavonia, together with forces from the Zagreb Bishopry, managed to lift the siege of Knin in January 1513. Next year in February the Ottomans laid siege on Knin with 10,000 men from the Sanjak of Bosnia, but were unable to take the city and lost 500 troops. Knin's burg and outskirts were burned on this occasion.<ref>Vjekoslav Klai\u0107: Povijest Hrvata od najstarijih vremena do svr\u0161etka XIX. stolje\u0107a, Knjiga \u010detvrta, Zagreb, 1988, p. 302</ref>{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=88}} These clashes left Knin devastated and there was no news about the city for five years. Local population was decimated by war, hunger, plague and migration to safer places, and its economy was hindered by the seizure of crops and livestock. Due to Knin's strategic value, King [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] responded to requests from captains of Knin, Skradin and Ostrovica and promised reinforcements of 1,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalrymen. However, it is unlikely that these forces arrived to the endangered towns.\n\nOn May 29, 1522, [[Siege of Knin|after the final siege]] of the Knin castle, it fell to the [[Ottoman Empire]],{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=89}} and Croats left the town in large numbers.

NK Dinara's colours were black and white until 2005 when the club changed its colours to red, white and blue. NK Dinara plays in the 4th division in Croatia ([[1. \u017dupanijska liga \u0160ibensko-kninska]]). The logo of NK Dinara is red, white, and blue (in that order) with the letter \"D\" in the middle of the logo.\n\nKnin has a sports association which was formed in 1998. [[Basketball]] is also popular in Knin. The Croatian National basketball team has played a match in Knin. They played against [[Israel]] in 1999 where Croatia won the match 78:68. Other sports played in Knin are [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[team handball|handball]], [[volleyball]], [[kickboxing]], [[karate]], [[tennis]]  and [[taekwondo]].\n\n==Transport==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\n[[File:Station Knin.JPG|thumb|right|Knin railway station building]]\nThe most important intercity roadway in Knin is the Croatian [[D1 (Croatia)|state route D1]]. The route makes for easy access of Knin from the major coastal city of [[Split (city)|Split]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} The section of D1 from Knin to [[A1 (Croatia)|A1]] highway will be upgraded to the expressway level in following years (with [[B1 (Croatia)|B1]] expressway).\n\nKnin is also an important railway junction as the railroads from the rest of Dalmatia and its cities of [[Zadar]], [[Split (city)|Split]] and [[\u0160ibenik railway station|\u0160ibenik]] pass through Knin, going north to the capital city of Croatia, [[Zagreb]], via [[M604 railway (Croatia)|M604 railway]]. There are four lines meeting in Knin station: to [[Perkovi\u0107, Croatia|Perkovi\u0107]] (and then to Split or [[\u0160ibenik railway station|\u0160ibenik]]), to Zadar, to [[Ogulin]] (and onwards to [[Karlovac]], Zagreb) and to [[Martin Brod]] (and [[Biha\u0107]], Sisak, Zagreb). Only the former three lines offer passenger transport. The latter route, Knin-Biha\u0107-Zagreb, passes through Bosnian territory, crossing the border many times, thus it is not used for passenger transport since the beginning of the war in 1991. However, it is the shortest route between Knin and Zagreb, and as such was electrified in 1984 (the [[overhead line|catenary]] being subsequently destroyed by war operations in the early 1990s). [[Railway electrification system|Electrification]] had started from [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] inland towards the coast and had only reached Knin, so today the Knin station sidings are equipped with overhead catenary, but lines leaving the town are not.\n[[File:\u017deljezni\u010dki-kolodvor-postaja-Knin-05082016-02-roberta-f.jpg|thumb|right|Knin railway station's platforms, notice the lack of catenary wires, and the presence of the poles only]]\n\n==Towns and villages in the municipality==\n\n*[[Golubi\u0107, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Golubi\u0107]]\n*Knin\n*[[Kninsko Polje]]\n*[[Kova\u010di\u0107, Croatia|Kova\u010di\u0107]]\n*[[Ljuba\u010d, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Ljuba\u010d]]\n*[[O\u0107estovo]]\n*[[Plavno, Croatia|Plavno]]\n*[[Pola\u010da, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Pola\u010da]]\n*[[Potkonje]]\n*[[Radljevac]]\n*[[Strmica, Croatia|Strmica]]\n*[[Vrpolje, Knin|Vrpolje]]\n*[[\u017dagrovi\u0107]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Croatia}}\n* [[Church of Saint Anthony, Knin]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite web|ref={{harvid|ICJ|3 February 2015}}|title=Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v.

Knin rose to prominence twice in history, as the capital of both the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Medieval)|medieval Kingdom of Croatia]] and, briefly, of the self-proclaimed [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] [[Croatian War of Independence|from 1991 to 1995]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name is likely derived from the [[Illyria]]n ''Ninia''.<ref name=\"knin.hr\">http://www.knin.hr/povijest/</ref> According to an alternative explanation, offered by [[Franz Miklosich]] and [[Petar Skok]], the name - derived from a Slavic root ''*t\u044cn-'' (\"to cut\", \"to chop\") - has a meaning of \"cleared forest\".{{sfn|\u0160imunovi\u0107|2013|p=167}} The medieval names of Knin include {{lang-hu|Tinin}}; {{lang-it|Tenin}}; {{lang-la|Tinum}}.

The first church, a monastery dedicated to Saint Bartholomew, was built during the time of [[Trpimir I]] in the 9th century in Kapitul (south-east from Knin Castle, where the later bishopric was located).<ref>https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/140670</ref><ref>http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?id=62489</ref> It was later expanded or rebuilt by a certain Duke of Croatia, probably Svetoslav, during the reign of king [[Stephen Dr\u017eislav of Croatia]] in the 10th century.<ref>Nikola Jak\u0161i\u0107, [https://www.academia.edu/22968166/Knin-_hrvatska_srednjovjekovna_prijestolnica_Split_1995 Knin- hrvatska srednjovjekovna prijestolnica, Split 1995] pp. 7</ref>\n\nKnin is first mentioned in the 10th-century work ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' as the centre of the Knin county ([[\u017eupanija]]), and as one of the populated towns in [[Kingdom of Croatia (925\u20131102)|Croatia]]. Around 1040, at the behest of the Croatian kings, a seat of the royal bishop was established in the nearby royal village of Biskupija (Kosovo), in the church of Saint Mary. The first \"bishop of the Croats\" is named ''Marko Giudice'', and he and his successors were attached to the royal court as preachers and king's \"special bishops\" until 1102.<ref>''[[Illyricum sacrum]]'', IV (Venice, 1775)</ref>{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=23}}\n\nIn the second half of the 11th century, Knin became a more permanent royal residence of king [[Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia|Demetrius Zvonimir]] around 1080.

At that point, it came into possession of the Hungarian [[Arpad dynasty]], and since then, it ceased to be a permanent royal residence but remained as a political and administrative center of the kingdom.

Due to the extinction of the local ruling dynasty, the Croatian bishop moved his see to Knin itself, after which he started calling himself the Bishop of Knin.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=28}} This precipitated the construction of a new cathedral, which was initiated in 1203 by the son of the Duke of Knin, Dobroslav in Kapitul.\n\nThe city was visited by Queen [[Maria Laskarina]], the daughter of the [[Byzantine Emperor]] and wife of king Bela IV, together with her retinue of nobles and a great number of soldiers in 1261 in order to introduce her son to the Croatian nobility and to negotiate their oath in recognizing him as the designated duke (herceg).{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=32}} In 1264, the first case of judicial function in the city was mentioned and during this time, Knin was the seat of both the Croatian ban, and the duke, who acted as a semi-independent ruler with close connection to the king and whose chancellor had been the bishop of Knin.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=33}} Between 1270 and 1272, the new cathedral was consecrated on the orders of the Knin bishop Nicholas.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1949}}<ref>Nikola Jak\u0161i\u0107, [https://www.academia.edu/22968166/Knin-_hrvatska_srednjovjekovna_prijestolnica_Split_1995 Knin- hrvatska srednjovjekovna prijestolnica, Split 1995] pp. 19</ref> The cathedral is described as being \"magnificent\" and \"solemn\" by subsequent documents.

According to the 19th century Franciscan friar and historian [[Donato Fabianich]], the monastery of [[St. Catharines|Saint Catherine]] was founded around this time by the Knin dignitaries and nobility which were first settled there by Mladen \u0160ubi\u0107.<ref>Donato Fabianich, Storia dei fratri minori dai primordi della joro istituzione in Dal\u00b7 mazia e Bossina, fino ai giorni nostri, I, Zadar 1863, pp. 94.</ref> Their rule over Knin came to an end at the [[Battle of Bliska]] in 1322, after which the Angevin king [[Charles I of Hungary|Charles Robert]] arrived in the city and imprisoned the former lord [[Mladen II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir]].{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=35}} Upon the departure of the king to Hungary, the noble [[Ivan Nelipi\u0107]] quickly seized Knin, and from there expelled the king's men from Croatia. Thus, these territories ''de facto'' continued to remain outside the monarchy, and the [[Nelipi\u0107 noble family]] made Knin their permanent seat and ruled their territories as \"Princes of Knin\".\n\nAfter successfully warring against their enemies, the Dalmatian cities and nobility under [[George II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir|Juraj II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir]] (who was imprisoned in the castle's dungeons), as well as the royal forces commanded by the [[Ban of Slavonia|Slavonian ban]] ''Mikac Prodani\u0107'',<ref>Miha Madijev, cap. XXIII.{{full citation needed|date=December 2016}}</ref> their rule came to an end when [[Louis I of Hungary]] personally led an army to re-establish royal power over Knin in 1345. During this time it became known that the castle consisted of two major parts, administered by two castellans and which was populated by houses and baths, a palace with a main hall used previously by the Nelipi\u0107's to sign an alliance with the [[Republic of Venice]] and to enforce customs on imports to the city.

There the noble Ivan Nelipi\u0107 (son of Vladislava) had reaffirmed his rights to the estates and lands in [[Cetina]] during his stay in the city.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|pp=52\u201353}}{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|pp=55\u201356}}\n[[File:StefatonKnin.png|thumb|right|250px|Stone slab of Knin Fortress depicting [[Stephaton]] thought to have originated from the Church of St. Stephen in the Knin's burg, 11th century]]\nUsing the dynastic instability in the neighboring lands, the city came into the hands of the Bosnian king [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko I]] during the year of 1388. The previous bishop had likely been expelled, where the [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] Mihailo took his place, and was also given the office of the king's chancellor. These actions provoked a retaliation of king [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], whose armies besieged Knin in September 1390. The city, along with other territories were returned to Sigismund in 1393. Upon his return from the disastrous [[battle of Nicopolis]] in 1396, the king spent a month in Knin to consolidate his holdings and state affairs of Dalmatia and Croatia, issuing various decrees together with his ban [[Nicholas II Garai|Nikola Gorjanski]].{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=60}} In 1401, the city was besieged by the Bosnian king [[Stephen Ostoja]], who encamped in the adjacent Knin field (Kninsko polje), and remained there until the following year. The newly crowned king [[Ladislaus of Naples]] attained support from the castellan of Knin and issued his first decree there in 1403.\n\nBecause of frequent harassment, the citizens of Knin had to pay tribute to the duke [[Hrvoje Vuk\u010di\u0107 Hrvatini\u0107]], and for a short while, the city seemed to have been directly under his rule. The presence of [[Franciscans]] is for the first time mentioned in the 15th century, which were located in the old Saint Mary's church and monastery in the city. Apart from them, other religious buildings are mentioned such as the church of the [[Holy Spirit]].<ref name=\"academia.edu\"/>\n\nIts strategic position played an important role in many wars and power changes \u2013 the Republic of Venice often reflected on its importance as a key castle and the main entrance to Dalmatia, which it attempted to obtain during the 15th century.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=64}} During these years both the city, the ban and his dignitaries played a crucial role in the struggle for dominance over the coastal cities with Venice. In 1430 Knin and the Church of St. Bartolomeo in Kapitul were the centre of the \"Union and Brotherhood of the Croats\" ({{lang-la|unio et fraternitas Croatorum}}), a congregation of [[Croatian nobility|Croatian nobles]] formed by 12 [[counties of Croatia]] in order to \"preserve the fame and old customs of the Croatian Kingdom\".<ref>Mladen An\u010di\u0107: \"Desetlje\u0107e od 1091. do 1102. u zrcalu vrela\" (Summary: The decade between 1091 and 1102 according to the sources), Povijesni prilozi 17/1998, p. 253</ref><ref>Damir Karbi\u0107: Hrvatski plemi\u0107ki rod i obi\u010dajno pravo, p. 109-111</ref>\n\nIt was in 1420 that the Nelipi\u0107 noble family again regained their former role in Croatia with the emergence of [[Ivani\u0161 Nelipi\u0107]], which again distanced these territories from the crown. These possessions were later acquired after Ivani\u0161's death in 1435 by [[Ivan Frankopan|An\u017e]] of the [[House of Frankopan]] through the marriage with the Nelipi\u0107 nobles. Knin and the surrounding possessions were restored to the crown upon An\u017e's death in 1437.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=68}} In 1454 an attempt between the Bosnian king and the Venetians was made to acquire the city, which was referenced as \"capital and foremost place of Croatia\" in their letters.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=72}}\n\nDuring the reign of king [[Matthias Corvinus]], the bishops of Knin were selected as the king's principal orators abroad in collecting the help needed against the invading [[Ottoman Empire]]. The bishop was thus first secretly involved at the [[pope]] to solicit financial aid for Matthias' military campaign. The city's distant surroundings quickly became a target for Ottoman raids. As the raids were becoming more frequent, one of them reached Knin, where a Franciscan monastery has been recorded to have been destroyed in 1469.\n\nIn 1493, the first direct attempt of siege by the Ottomans was undertaken, which was followed by ban [[John Corvinus]] and his deputies invading and pillaging the Ottoman territories from the city. The Republic of Venice started to financially support the city's defences in fear for its possessions in Dalmatia. In 1501, three Ottoman spies were caught and imprisoned by the vice-ban. They were sent by the [[Sanjak of Bosnia|Sanjak-bey of Bosnia]], and had infiltrated Knin posing as friars that were on their way to sell [[vestment]]s to the market. They were to investigate the situation in the Zadar surrounding.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=82}}\n\n[[File:KninPagano1525.png|thumb|right|280px|Knin castle, settlement and Kapitul around 1525, after Ottoman conquest from the map of Dalmatia from [[Matteo Pagano]]]]\nThe last major conflict around Knin before the truce was in September 1502 when 2,000 Ottoman cavalrymen looted the area.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=84}} On 20 August 1503 King [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislaus II]] concluded a 7-year peace treaty with Sultan [[Bayezid II]].

A period of severe famine started in 1505 that affected entire Dalmatia. In 1510 the plague halved Knin's population.\n\nIn 1510 around 1,000 Ottoman [[Ak\u0131nc\u0131]] raided the countryside of Knin. There had been word that viceban of Croatia was captured on that occasion. Baltazar Ba\u0107an ({{lang-hu|Boldizs\u00e1r Batthy\u00e1ny}}), viceban of Slavonia, together with forces from the Zagreb Bishopry, managed to lift the siege of Knin in January 1513. Next year in February the Ottomans laid siege on Knin with 10,000 men from the Sanjak of Bosnia, but were unable to take the city and lost 500 troops. Knin's burg and outskirts were burned on this occasion.<ref>Vjekoslav Klai\u0107: Povijest Hrvata od najstarijih vremena do svr\u0161etka XIX. stolje\u0107a, Knjiga \u010detvrta, Zagreb, 1988, p. 302</ref>{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=88}} These clashes left Knin devastated and there was no news about the city for five years. Local population was decimated by war, hunger, plague and migration to safer places, and its economy was hindered by the seizure of crops and livestock. Due to Knin's strategic value, King [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] responded to requests from captains of Knin, Skradin and Ostrovica and promised reinforcements of 1,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalrymen.

After the [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|Peace of Pressburg]] in 1805, the French Empire gained the city and incorporated it into the [[Illyrian Provinces]] in 1809. By 1813, the Austrians regained control over the town. By the end of the 19th century, as a part of the [[Habsburg]] domain of Dalmatia, Knin grew steadily, becoming an important commercial as well as road and railway center. In 1867, Knin became a part of [[Dalmatia]] \u2013 a territorial entity within [[Cisleithania]]. After the [[First World War]] Knin became a part of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] in 1918, which subsequently became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] ([[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] after 1929).\n\n===Modern===\n[[File:Spomenik hrvatske pobjede Oluja 95 16 obljetnica vojnoredarstvene operacije Oluja 04082011 5047-2.jpg|thumb|left|Monument of the Croatian Victory \"Storm '95\"]]\n{{Expand section|date=June 2016}}\nFrom October 1990,<ref name=\"The war\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hic.hr/ratni-zlocini/hrvatska/dalmacija/kronologija.htm|title=Kronologija Domovinskog rata u Lici i Sjevernoj Dalmaciji|accessdate=26 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125151650/http://www.hic.hr/ratni-zlocini/hrvatska/dalmacija/kronologija.htm|archivedate=25 November 2014}}</ref> eight months before Croatia [[Croatian War of Independence|declared independence]] (June 25, 1991) from [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]], Knin became the main stronghold for the [[Serbs]] in the [[Kninska Krajina|Knin region]], eventually becoming the capital city of the internationally unrecognised [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] in 1991.<ref name=\"Knin-Domovinski Rat\">[http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20051126063710/http://www.knin.hr/stranice/o_kninu/domovinski_rat.asp Knin-Domovinski Rat]</ref> The leaders of ''Krajina'' were Knin locals: [[Milan Marti\u0107]] and [[Milan Babi\u0107]], both convicted for [[ethnic cleansing]] of Croats and other non-Serbs from Krajina by [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]].<ref name=\"ICTY judgment\">{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/martic/tjug/en/070612_summary_en.pdf|title=Summary of Judgement for Milan Marti\u0107|accessdate=18 May 2011|publisher=[[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]]}}</ref> Widespread acts of murder and violence, detention and intimidation became pervasive throughout the RSK territory from 1992 to 1995.<ref name=\"ICTY judgment\" /> During that time 93,9% of Croats were expelled from the town and municipality of Knin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://narod.hr/kultura/19-ozujka-1993-knin-znate-li-da-su-srbi-protjerali-iz-grada-i-okolice-cak-94-hrvata|title=18. o\u017eujka 1993.

NK Dinara's colours were black and white until 2005 when the club changed its colours to red, white and blue. NK Dinara plays in the 4th division in Croatia ([[1. \u017dupanijska liga \u0160ibensko-kninska]]). The logo of NK Dinara is red, white, and blue (in that order) with the letter \"D\" in the middle of the logo.\n\nKnin has a sports association which was formed in 1998. [[Basketball]] is also popular in Knin. The Croatian National basketball team has played a match in Knin. They played against [[Israel]] in 1999 where Croatia won the match 78:68. Other sports played in Knin are [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[team handball|handball]], [[volleyball]], [[kickboxing]], [[karate]], [[tennis]]  and [[taekwondo]].\n\n==Transport==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\n[[File:Station Knin.JPG|thumb|right|Knin railway station building]]\nThe most important intercity roadway in Knin is the Croatian [[D1 (Croatia)|state route D1]]. The route makes for easy access of Knin from the major coastal city of [[Split (city)|Split]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} The section of D1 from Knin to [[A1 (Croatia)|A1]] highway will be upgraded to the expressway level in following years (with [[B1 (Croatia)|B1]] expressway).\n\nKnin is also an important railway junction as the railroads from the rest of Dalmatia and its cities of [[Zadar]], [[Split (city)|Split]] and [[\u0160ibenik railway station|\u0160ibenik]] pass through Knin, going north to the capital city of Croatia, [[Zagreb]], via [[M604 railway (Croatia)|M604 railway]]. There are four lines meeting in Knin station: to [[Perkovi\u0107, Croatia|Perkovi\u0107]] (and then to Split or [[\u0160ibenik railway station|\u0160ibenik]]), to Zadar, to [[Ogulin]] (and onwards to [[Karlovac]], Zagreb) and to [[Martin Brod]] (and [[Biha\u0107]], Sisak, Zagreb). Only the former three lines offer passenger transport. The latter route, Knin-Biha\u0107-Zagreb, passes through Bosnian territory, crossing the border many times, thus it is not used for passenger transport since the beginning of the war in 1991. However, it is the shortest route between Knin and Zagreb, and as such was electrified in 1984 (the [[overhead line|catenary]] being subsequently destroyed by war operations in the early 1990s). [[Railway electrification system|Electrification]] had started from [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] inland towards the coast and had only reached Knin, so today the Knin station sidings are equipped with overhead catenary, but lines leaving the town are not.\n[[File:\u017deljezni\u010dki-kolodvor-postaja-Knin-05082016-02-roberta-f.jpg|thumb|right|Knin railway station's platforms, notice the lack of catenary wires, and the presence of the poles only]]\n\n==Towns and villages in the municipality==\n\n*[[Golubi\u0107, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Golubi\u0107]]\n*Knin\nBiskupija\n*[[Kninsko Polje]]\n*[[Kova\u010di\u0107, Croatia|Kova\u010di\u0107]]\n*[[Ljuba\u010d, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Ljuba\u010d]]\n*[[O\u0107estovo]]\nOrlic\n*[[Plavno, Croatia|Plavno]]\n*[[Pola\u010da, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Pola\u010da]]\n*[[Potkonje]]\n*[[Radljevac]]\n*[[Strmica, Croatia|Strmica]]\n*[[Vrpolje, Knin|Vrpolje]]\n*[[\u017dagrovi\u0107]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Croatia}}\n* [[Church of Saint Anthony, Knin]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite web|ref={{harvid|ICJ|3 February 2015}}|title=Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v.
