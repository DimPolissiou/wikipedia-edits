It was supplied to several states during World War II, and served with several countries for many years after the war.

The result of the studies was four broad outlines for future aircraft:<ref name=\"Zobel and Mathmann 1995, p. 3\">Zobel and Mathmann 1995, p. 3.</ref>\n*''R\u00fcstungsflugzeug I'' for a multi-seat medium bomber\n*''R\u00fcstungsflugzeug II'' for a tactical bomber\n*''R\u00fcstungsflugzeug III'' for  a single-seat fighter\n*''R\u00fcstungsflugzeug IV'' for a two-seat heavy fighter\n[[File:Me109 clip.ogg|thumb|right|Bf 109 in flight]]\n\n''R\u00fcstungsflugzeug III'' was intended to be a short range interceptor, replacing the [[Arado Ar 64]] and [[Heinkel He 51]] biplanes then in service. In late March 1933 the RLM published the tactical requirements for a single-seat fighter in the document L.A. 1432/33.<ref name=\"Ritger 2006, p. 6\">Ritger 2006, p. 6.</ref>\n\nThe fighter had a top speed of 400&nbsp;km/h (250&nbsp;mph) at 6,000&nbsp;m (19,690&nbsp;ft), which could be maintained for 20 minutes, while having a total flight duration of 90 minutes. The [[critical altitude]] of 6,000 metres could be reached in no more than 17 minutes, and the fighter had an operational ceiling of 10,000 metres.<ref name=\"Ritger 2006, p. 6\" /> Power was to be provided by a [[Junkers Jumo 210]] engine of about 522&nbsp;kW (700&nbsp;hp). It was to be armed with either a single 20&nbsp;mm MG C/30 engine-mounted cannon firing through the propeller hub as a ''Motorkanone'', or two [[Synchronization gear|synchronized]], engine cowl-mounted 7.92&nbsp;mm (.312&nbsp;in) [[MG 17 machine gun]]s, or one lightweight engine-mounted 20&nbsp;mm [[MG FF cannon]] with two 7.92&nbsp;mm MG 17s.<ref>Kobel and Mathmann 1997, p. 3.</ref> The MG C/30 was an airborne adaption of the [[2 cm FlaK 30]] anti-aircraft gun, which fired very powerful [[20x138mmB|\"Long Solothurn\"]] ammunition, but was very heavy and had a low fire rate. It was also specified that the [[wing loading]] should be kept below 100&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>.

The basic mock-up was completed by May, and a more detailed design mock-up was ready by January 1935.  The RLM designated the design as type \"Bf 109,\" the next available from a block of numbers assigned to BFW.<ref name=\"Ritger 2006, p. 6\" />\n\nThe first prototype (''Versuchsflugzeug 1'' or '''V1'''), with civilian registration '''D-IABI''', was completed by May 1935, but the new German engines were not yet ready. To get the \"R III\" designs into the air, the RLM acquired four [[Rolls-Royce Kestrel]] VI engines by trading Rolls-Royce a [[Heinkel He 70]] ''Blitz'' for use as an engine test-bed.{{#tag:ref|This aircraft was instrumental in testing the Rolls-Royce PV-12, later to become the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]]|group=nb}} Messerschmitt received two of these engines and adapted the engine mounts of '''V1''' to take the V-12 engine upright.

Although it had some advanced features, it used a novel, complex retractable main undercarriage which proved to be unreliable.<ref>Green 1980, pp. 18\u201321.</ref>\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-337-0036-02A, Im Westen, Feldflugplatz mit Me 109.jpg|thumb|left|''[[JG 53]]'' Bf 109E-3, c. 1939/1940]]\n\nInitially, the Bf 109 was regarded with disfavour by E-Stelle test pilots because of its steep ground angle, which resulted in poor forward visibility when taxiing; the sideways-hinged cockpit canopy, which could not be opened in flight; and the automatic [[leading edge slats]] on the wings which, it was thought, would inadvertently open during aerobatics, possibly leading to crashes. This was later borne out in combat situations and aerobatic testing by various countries' test establishments. The leading edge slats and ailerons would flutter rapidly in fast tight turns, making targeting and control difficult, and eventually putting the aircraft into a stall.  They were also concerned about the high wing loading.<ref>Green 1980, p. 14.</ref>\n\nThe [[Heinkel He 112]], based on a scaled-down [[Heinkel He 70|''Blitz'']], was the favourite of the Luftwaffe aders. Compared with the Bf 109, it was also cheaper.<ref>Caidin 1968{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> Positive spects of the He 112 included the wide track and robustness of the undercarriage (this opened outwards from mid wing, as opposed to the 109s whicopened from the [[wing root]]), considerably better visibility from the cockpit, and a lower wing loading that made for easier landings. In addition, the V4 had a single-piece, clear-view, sliding cockpit canopy and a more powerful Jumo 210Da engine with a modified exhaust system. However, the He 112 was  via a series of strong-points. By concentrating the loads in the firewall, the structure of the Bf 109 could be made relatively light and uncomplicated.<ref>Cross and Scarborough 1976, pp. 56\u201366.</ref>\n\n[[File:Messerschmitt Bf109E-4-B \u20184101 - Black 12\u2019 (DG200) (33115891765).jpg|thumb|A Bf109E at the [[Royal Air Force Museum London]] with its wings temporarily removed, 2016]]\nAn advantage of this design was that the main landing gear, which retrcacted through an 85-degree angle, was attached to the [[fuselage]], making it possible to completely remove the wings for servicing without additional equipment to support the fuselage. It also allowed simplification of the wing structure, since it did not have to bear the loads imposed during takeoff or landing. The one major drawback of this landing gear arrangement was its narrow [[Track (automobile)|wheel track]], making the aircraft unstable while on the ground. To increase stability, the legs were splayed outward somewhat, creating another problem in that the loads imposed during takeoff and landing were transferred up through the legs at an angle.<ref name=\"Cross and Scarborough, pp. 60\u201361\">Cross and Scarborough 1976, pp. 60\u201361.</ref>\n\nThe small rudder of the Bf 109 was relatively ineffective at controlling the strong swing created by the powerful slipstream of the propeller during the early portion of the takeoff roll, and this sideways drift created disproportionate loads on the wheel opposite to the swing. If the forces imposed were large enough, the pivot point broke and the landing gear leg would collapse outward into its bay.<ref name=\"Cross and Scarborough, pp. 60\u201361\" /> Experienced pilots reported that the swing was easy to control, but some of the less-experienced pilots lost fighters on takeoff.<ref name=\"hannu\" />\n\nBecause of the large ground angle caused by the long legs, forward visibility while on the ground was very poor, a problem exacerbated by the sideways-opening canopy. This meant that pilots had to taxi in a sinuous fashion which also imposed stresses on the splayed undercarriage legs. Ground accidents were a problem with inexperienced pilots, especially during the later stages of the war when pilots received less training before being sent to operational units.<ref name=\"hannu\">Hannu Valtonen \u2014 Messerschmitt Bf 109 ja saksan sotatalous{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> At least 10% of all Bf 109s were lost in takeoff and landing accidents, 1,500 of which occurred between 1939 and 1941.<ref name=\"Boyne 1994, p. 30\">Boyne 1994, p. 30.</ref> The installation of a fixed \"tall\" tailwheel on some of the late G-10s and \u221214s and the K-series helped alleviate the problem to a large extent.<ref>Radinger and Otto 1999, p. 36.</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1980-005-05, Fl\u00fcgel einer Messerschmitt Me 109.jpg|thumb|right|Freely moving, automatic [[leading edge slats]] on a Bf 109E. By using high-lift devices, the handling qualities of the Bf 109 were considerably enhanced.]]\n\nFrom the inception of the design, priority was given to easy access to the powerplant, fuselage weapons and other systems while the aircraft was operating from [[forward airfield]]s. To this end, the entire engine [[cowling]] was made up of large, easily removable panels which were secured by large toggle latches. A large panel under the wing centre section could be removed to gain access to the L-shaped main [[fuel tank]], which was sited partly under the cockpit floor and partly behind the rear cockpit bulkhead. Other, smaller panels gave easy access to the cooling system and electrical equipment.<ref name=\"Cross and Scarborough, pp. 60\u201361\" /> The engine was held in two large, forged, ''[[Elektron (alloy)|Elektron]]'' [[magnesium]] [[alloy]] Y-shaped legs, one per side straddling the engine block, which were [[cantilever]]ed from the firewall. Each of the legs was secured by two quick-release screw fittings on the firewall. All of the main pipe connections were colour-coded and grouped in one place, where possible, and electrical equipment plugged into junction boxes mounted on the firewall. The entire powerplant could be removed or replaced as a unit in a matter of minutes,<ref name=\"Cross and Scarborough, pp. 60\u201361\" /> a potential step to the eventual adoption of the unitized-powerplant ''[[Kraftei]]'' engine mounting concept used by many German combat aircraft designs, later in the war years.\n\nAnother example of the Bf 109's advanced design was the use of a single, I-beam main [[Spar (aviation)|spar]] in the wing, positioned more aft than usual (to give enough room for the retracted wheel), thus forming a stiff D-shaped torsion box. Most aircraft of the era used two spars, near the front and rear edges of the wings, but the D-box was much stiffer [[torsion (mechanics)|torsionally]], and eliminated the need for the rear spar. The wing profile was the NACA 2R1 14.2 at the root and NACA 2R1 11.35 at the tip,<ref>Lednicer, David. [http://www.ae.illinois.edu/m-selig/ads/aircraft.html ''The Incomplete Guide to Airfoil Usage''.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420012244/http://www.ae.illinois.edu/m-selig/ads/aircraft.html |date=20 April 2010 }} Champaign, Illinois: UIUC Applied Aerodynamics Group, 2010. Retrieved: 18 May 2011.</ref> with a thickness to [[Chord (aircraft)|chord]] ratio of 14.2% at the root and 11.35% at the tip.\n\nAnother major difference from competing designs was the higher wing-loading. While the R-IV contract called for a wing-loading of less than 100&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, Messerschmitt felt this was unreasonable. With a low wing-loading and the engines available, a fighter would end up being slower than the bombers it was tasked with catching.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nA fighter was designed primarily for high-speed flight. A smaller wing area was optimal for achieving high speed, but low-speed flight would suffer, as the smaller wing would require more airflow to generate enough lift to maintain flight. To compensate for this, the Bf 109 included advanced [[high-lift device]]s on the wings, including automatically-opening [[leading edge slats]], and fairly large camber-changing [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]] on the [[trailing edge]]. The slats increased the lift of the wing considerably when deployed,<!---link no loner operating<ref>http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Theories_of_Flight/Devices/TH17G2.htm</ref>---> greatly improving the horizontal maneuverability of the aircraft, as several Luftwaffe veterans, such as Erwin Leykauf, attest.<ref>[http://109lair.hobbyvista.com/techref/systems/control/slats/slats.htm] Bf 109 slats explained, ''Bf 109 Lair''.

For this reason, on later Bf 109 F, and K models, the two coolant radiators were equipped with a cut-off system. If one radiator leaked, it was possible to fly on the second, or to fly for at least five minutes with both closed.<ref>Ers\u00e4tzteiliste Bf 109G, pp. 117\u2013118.</ref><ref name=\"Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 12-14\">Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 12-14.</ref><ref name=\"Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 169\">Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 169.</ref><ref>Ers\u00e4tzteiliste Bf 109K, Rumpfwerk, Baugruppe 209.728.</ref><ref name=\"auto\">Drabkin 2007, p. 74.</ref> In 1943, Oberfeldwebel [[Edmund Ro\u00dfmann]] got lost and landed behind Soviet lines. He agreed to show the Soviets how to service the plane. Soviet machine gun technician Viktor M. Sinaisky recalled:\n{{quote|The Messer was a very well designed plane. First, it had an engine of an inverted type, so it could not be knocked out from below. It also had two water radiators with a cut-off system: if one radiator leaked you could fly on the second or close both down and fly at least five minutes more. The pilot was protected by armour-plate from the back, and the fuel tank was also behind armour. Our planes had fuel tanks in the centre of their wings: that's why our pilot got burnt. What else did I like about the Messer? It was highly automatic and thus easy to fly. It also employed an electrical pitch regulator, which our planes didn't have. Our propeller system, with variable pitch was hydraulic, making it impossible to change pitch without engine running. If, God forbid, you turned off the engine at high pitch, it was impossible to turn the propeller and was very hard to start the engine again. Finally, the German ammo counter was also a great thing.<ref name=\"auto\" />}}\n\n=== Armament and gondola cannons ===\n[[File:Messerschmitt Bf 109E.jpg|thumb|right|A cannon-armed Bf 109E, showing the 20&nbsp;mm [[MG FF cannon|MG FF]] installations in the wing.]]\nReflecting Messerschmitt's belief in low-weight, low-drag, simple monoplanes, the armament was placed in the fuselage. This kept the wings very thin and light.  Two [[Synchronization gear|synchronized]] machine guns were mounted in the cowling, firing over the top of the engine and through the propeller arc. An alternative arrangement was also designed, consisting of a single [[autocannon]] firing through a blast tube between the cylinder banks of the engine, known as a ''Motorkanone'' mount in German.<ref name=\"Zobel and Mathmann 1995, p. 3\" /> {{#tag:ref|The engine's mass helped buffer the recoil. British reports on captured DB 601 series engines describe \"a double-walled cannon tube housing\" as part of the [[crankcase]]. Few if any Bf 109s used weapons firing through the propeller hub before the F-series, which mounted 15&nbsp;mm (.59&nbsp;in) and 20&nbsp;mm weapons.<ref>Cross and Scarborough 1976, p. 74.</ref>|group=nb}} This was also the choice of armament layout on some contemporary monoplane fighters, such as the French [[Dewoitine D.520]], or the American [[Bell P-39 Airacobra]], and dated back to [[World War I]]'s small run of [[SPAD S.XII]] ''moteur-canon'', 37&nbsp;mm  cannon-armed fighters in France.\n\nWhen it was discovered in 1937 that the RAF was planning eight-gun batteries for its new [[Hawker Hurricane]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighters, it was decided that the Bf 109 should be more heavily armed. The problem was that the only place available to mount additional guns was in the wings. Only one spot was available in each wing, between the wheel well and slats, with room for only one gun, either a 7.92&nbsp;mm [[MG 17 machine gun]], or a 20&nbsp;mm MG FF or MG FF/M cannon.<ref name=\"Cross and Scarborough 1976, p. 15.\" />\n\nThe first version of the 109 to have wing guns was the C-1, which had one MG 17 in each wing. To avoid redesigning the wing to accommodate large ammunition boxes and access hatches, an unusual ammunition feed was devised whereby a continuous belt holding 500 rounds was fed along chutes out to the wing tip, around a roller and then back along the wing, forward and beneath the gun breech, to the wing root, where it coursed around another roller and back to the weapon.<ref name=\"Cross and Scarborough 1976, p. 15.\">Cross and Scarborough 1976, p. 15.</ref>\n\nThe gun barrel was placed in a long, large-diameter tube located between the spar and the leading edge. The tube channeled cooling air around the barrel and breech, exhausting out of a slot at the rear of the wing. The installation was so cramped that parts of the MG 17's breech mechanism extended into an opening created in the flap structure.<ref name=\"Cross and Scarborough 1976, p. 15.\" />\n\nThe much longer and heavier MG FF had to be mounted farther along the wing in an outer bay. A large hole was cut through the spar allowing the cannon to be fitted with the ammunition feed forward of the spar, while the breech block projected rearward through the spar. A 60-round ammunition drum was placed in a space closer to the wing root causing a bulge in the underside. A small hatch was incorporated in the bulge to allow access for changing the drum. The entire weapon could be removed for servicing by removing a leading edge panel.<ref name=\"Cross and Scarborough 1976, p. 15.\" />\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-487-3066-04, Flugzeug Messerschmitt Me 109.jpg|thumb|right|Luftwaffe ground-crew positioning a Bf 109G-6 equipped with the [[R\u00fcstsatz]] VI underwing gondola cannon kit. Note the slat on the leading edge of the port wing. [[JG 2]], France, late 1943.]]\nFrom the 109F-series onwards, guns were no longer carried inside the wings. Instead, the Bf 109F had a 20&nbsp;mm gun firing through the propeller shaft.

The 109 remained in production from 1937 through 1945 in many different variants and sub-variants. The primary engines used were the Daimler-Benz [[Daimler-Benz DB 601|DB 601]] and [[DB 605]], though the Junkers [[Jumo 210]] powered most of the pre-war variants. The most-produced Bf 109 model was the 109G series (more than a third of all 109s built were the G-6 series, 12,000 units being manufactured from March 1943 until the end of the war).<ref>Prien and Rodeike 1996, pp. 99\u2013100, 113\u2013114.</ref> The initial production models of the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109 variants#Bf 109 A/B/C/D|A, B, C and D series]] were powered by the relatively low-powered, 670\u2013700 PS (660\u2013690 HP) Junkers [[Jumo 210]] series engines. A few prototypes of these early aircraft were converted to use the more powerful DB 600.<ref>Green 1980, pp. 29\u201334, 41.</ref>\n\nThe first redesign came with the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109 variants#Bf_109E|E series]], including the naval variant, the Bf 109T (T standing for ''Tr\u00e4ger'', [[aircraft carrier|carrier]]). The Bf 109E (''Emil'') introduced structural changes to accommodate the heavier and more powerful 1,100 PS (1,085 HP) Daimler-Benz [[Daimler-Benz DB 601|DB 601]] engine, heavier armament and increased fuel capacity. Partly due to its limited 300&nbsp;km (186 mile) combat radius on internal fuel alone, resulting from its 660&nbsp;km (410 mile) range limit, later variants of the E series had a [[Aircraft of the Battle of Britain#German fighter fuel capacity|fuselage ordnance rack]] for fighter-bomber operations or provision for a long-range, standardized 300 litre (79 US gallon) drop-tank and used the DB 601N engine of higher power output.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref>Green 1980, pp. 41\u201345, 63\u201364, 76\u201381, 82\u201383.</ref> The 109E first saw service with the \"[[Condor Legion]]\" during the last phase of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and was the main variant from the beginning of [[World War II]] until mid-1941 when the 109F replaced it in the pure fighter role.<ref>Green 1980, pp. 38\u201339, 80.</ref> (Eight 109Es were assembled in [[Switzerland]] in 1946 by the Dornier-Werke, using licence built airframes; a ninth airframe was assembled using spare parts.)<ref>Green 1980, p. 78.</ref>\n\n[[File:Bf 109 F4 9 JG3 5582.JPG|thumb|Bf 109F-4 of [[JG 3]] near [[Reims]], France]]\n\nThe second big redesign during 1939\u201340 gave birth to the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109 variants#Bf_109F|F series]]. The ''Friedrich'' had new wings, cooling system and fuselage aerodynamics, with the 1,175 PS (1,159 HP) DB 601N (F-1, F-2) or the 1,350 PS (1,332 HP) DB 601E (F-3, F-4). Considered by many as the high-water mark of Bf 109 development, the F series abandoned the wing cannon and concentrated all armament in the forward fuselage with a pair of synchronized machine guns above and a single 15 or 20&nbsp;mm ''Motorkanone''-mount cannon behind the engine, the latter firing between the cylinder banks and through the propeller hub, itself covered by a more streamlined, half-elliptical shaped spinner that better matched the streamlining of the reshaped cowling, abandoning the smaller, conical spinner of the ''Emil'' subtype. The F-type also omitted the earlier stabilizer [[lift strut]] on either side of the tail. The improved aerodynamics were used by all later variants. Some Bf 109Fs were used late in the [[Battle of Britain]] in 1940 but the variant came into common use only in the first half of 1941.<ref>Prien and Rodeike 1996, pp. 9\u201325.</ref>\n\n[[File:Bf 109G-10 cockpit 070703-F-1234S-001.jpg|thumb|left|Bf 109 Gustav cockpit]]\nThe [[Messerschmitt Bf 109 variants#Bf 109G|G series]], or ''Gustav'', was  introduced in mid-1942. Its initial variants (G-1 through G-4) differed only in minor details from the Bf 109F, most notably in the more powerful 1,475 [[Pferdest\u00e4rke|PS]] (1,455 HP) [[Daimler-Benz DB 605|DB 605]] engine. Odd-numbered variants were built as high-altitude fighters with a pressurized cockpit and [[GM-1]] boost, while even-numbered variants were un-pressurized, air superiority fighters and fighter-bombers. Long-range [[photo-reconnaissance]] variants also existed. The later G series (G-5 through G-14) was produced in a multitude of variants, with uprated armament and provision for kits of packaged, generally factory-installed parts known as ''Umr\u00fcst-Baus\u00e4tze'' (usually contracted to ''Umbau'') and adding a \"/U\" suffix to the aircraft designation when installed. Field kits known as [[R\u00fcstsatz|''R\u00fcsts\u00e4tze'']] were also available for the G-series but those did not change the aircraft title. By early 1944, tactical requirements resulted in the addition of [[MW-50]] water injection boost and high-performance [[superchargers]], boosting engine output to 1,800\u20132,000 PS (1,775\u20131,973 HP). From early 1944, some G-2s, G-3s, G-4s and G-6s were converted to two-seat trainers, known as G-12s. An instructor's cockpit was added behind the original cockpit and both were covered by an elongated, glazed canopy.<ref>Prien and Rodeike 1996, pp. 56\u2013165.</ref>\n\nThe final production version of the Bf 109 was the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109 variants#Bf 109K|K series]] or ''Kurf\u00fcrst'', introduced in late 1944, powered by the DB 605D engine with up to 2,000 PS (1,973 HP). Though externally akin to the late production Bf 109G series, a large number of internal changes and aerodynamic improvements were incorporated that improved its effectiveness and remedied flaws, keeping it competitive with the latest Allied and Soviet fighters.<ref name=\"Radinger and Otto 1999, pp. 35\u201337\" /><ref>Prien and Rodeike 1996, pp. 166\u2013174.</ref> The Bf 109's outstanding rate of climb was superior to many Allied adversaries including the P-51D Mustang, Spitfire Mk.

By September 1939, the Bf 109 had become the main fighter of the Luftwaffe, replacing the biplane fighters, and was instrumental in gaining air superiority for the [[Wehrmacht]] during the early stages of the war. During the [[Battle of Britain]], it was pressed into the role of escort fighter, a role for which it was not originally designed, and it was widely employed as a [[fighter-bomber]], as well as a [[photo-reconnaissance]] platform. Despite mixed results over Britain, with the introduction of the improved Bf 109F in early 1941, the type again proved to be an effective fighter during the [[Invasion of Yugoslavia]] (where it was used by both sides), the [[Battle of Crete]], [[Operation Barbarossa]], the invasion of the [[USSR]], and the [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|Siege of Malta]].\n\nIn 1942, it began to be partially replaced in Western Europe by a new German fighter, the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]], but it continued to serve in a multitude of roles on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] and in the [[Defense of the Reich]], as well as in the [[Mediterranean Theatre of Operations]] and with [[Erwin Rommel]]'s [[Afrikakorps]]. It was also supplied to several of Germany's allies, including Italy, Finland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and Slovakia.\n\nMore aerial kills were made with the Bf 109 than any other aircraft of World War II.<ref name=\"Feist 1993, p. 50\" /> Many of the aerial victories were accomplished against poorly trained and badly organized Soviet forces in 1941 during [[Operation Barbarossa]]. The Soviets lost 21,200 aircraft at this time, about half to combat.<ref>Bergstr\u00f6m, Christer. ''Barbarossa \u2013 The Air Battle: July\u2013December 1941'', p. 117. London: Chevron/Ian Allan, 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-85780-270-2}}.</ref>  If shot down, the Luftwaffe pilots might land or parachute to friendly territory and return to fight again.  Later in the war, when Allied victories began to bring the fight closer, and then to German territory, bombing raids supplied plenty of targets for the Luftwaffe.  This unique combination of events \u2014 until [[Jimmy Doolittle#Doolittle's breakthrough in fighter tactics|a major change in American fighter tactics]] occurred very early in 1944, that steadily gave the Allies daylight [[air supremacy]] over the Reich \u2014 led to the highest-ever individual pilot victory scores.<ref>Toliver, Raymond F.; Constable, Trevor J. (1965). ''Fighter Aces'' MacMillan, New York, pp. 235\u2013236.</ref> One hundred and five Bf 109 pilots were each credited with the destruction of 100 or more enemy aircraft.{{#tag:ref|Some sources state one hundred and nine pilots were credited with more than 100 enemy aircraft.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}|group=nb}} Thirteen of these men scored more than 200 kills, while two scored more than 300. Altogether, this group of pilots was credited with a total of nearly 15,000 kills.<ref name=\"Feist 1993, p. 50\">Feist 1993, p. 50.</ref> Though no official [[Flying ace|\"ace\"]] status existed in the Luftwaffe (unofficially, the term ''Experte'' (expert) was used for an experienced pilot irrespective of his number of kills), using the Allied definition of pilots who scored five or more kills,  more than 2,500 ''Luftwaffe'' fighter pilots were considered aces in World War II.<ref>Feist 1993, p. 51.</ref> Against the Soviets, Finnish-flown Bf 109Gs claimed a victory ratio of 25:1.<ref name=\"Neulen p. 217.\">Neulen 2000, p. 217.</ref>\n\nBf 109s remained in foreign service for many years after World War II.  The Swiss used their Bf 109Gs well into the 1950s. The Finnish Air Force did not retire their Bf 109Gs until March 1954. Romania used its Bf 109s until 1955. The Spanish Hispanos flew even longer. Some were still in service in the late 1960s. They appeared in films (notably ''[[Battle of Britain (film)|Battle of Britain]]'') playing the role of Bf 109Es. Some Hispano airframes were sold to museums, which rebuilt them as Bf 109s.\n\n== Operators ==\nNote, this list includes operators who used Bf 109s for active service or combat. It does not include the United States, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, which all operated small numbers of captured aircraft for testing and evaluation (''see: [[Messerschmitt Bf 109 operational history#Allied Bf 109s]]'').\n\n[[File:Messerschmitt Bf 109G-2.jpg|thumb|Finnish Messerschmitt Bf 109G-2s during the [[Continuation War]]]]\n[[File:Messerschmitt Bf 109E Romania.jpg|thumb|right|Romanian Messerschmitt Bf 109 at Stalingrad]]\n[[File:Avia-S199-hatzerim-2.jpg|thumb|right|S-199 782358 IAFM]]\n[[File:Hispano Aviaci\u00f3n Ha 1112 Buchon.jpeg|thumb|[[Hispano Aviaci\u00f3n HA-1112]] ''Buchon'', the second and last Spanish version built by [[Hispano Aviaci\u00f3n]]]]\n[[File:Swiss Messerschmitt Bf 109-E3 top left view.jpg|thumb|A Bf 109E-3 of the [[Swiss Air Force]] at the [[Flieger-Flab-Museum]]]]\n[[File:Bf109 messerschmitt.JPG|thumb|right|Bf 109G-2 ''14792''<br />Yugoslavian Aviation Museum]]\n[[File:Japanese-109-front.jpg|thumb|right|Bf 109E-7 of the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force]] in November 1941]]\n;{{flag|Bulgaria}}\n*The [[Bulgarian Air Force]] operated 19 E-3s and 145 G-2/-6/-10s.\n;{{flagcountry|Independent State of Croatia}}\n*''[[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia|Zrakoplovstvo Nezavisne Dr\u017eave Hrvatske]]'' operated over 50 Bf 109s, including E-4, F-2, G-2/-6/-10 and Ks.\n;{{flag|Czechoslovakia}}\n*[[Czechoslovak Air Force]] operated captured aircraft and continued building Messerschmitt Bf 109Gs after the war under the Avia S-99 name, but soon ran out of the 109's Daimler-Benz DB 605 engine after many were destroyed during an explosion at a warehouse in Kr\u00e1sn\u00e9 B\u0159ezno.\n;{{FIN}}\n*[[Finnish Air Force]] ordered 162 aircraft (48 G-2s, 111 G-6s and three G-8s) from Germany, but 3 were destroyed during transit, leaving the FAF with 159 Bf 109s.

It was supplied to several states during World War II, and served with several countries for many years after the war.

The highest-scoring, [[Erich Hartmann]], was credited with 352 victories. The aircraft was also flown by [[Hans-Joachim Marseille]], the highest-scoring ace in the [[North African Campaign]] who shot down 158 enemy aircraft (in about a third of the time). It was also flown by many aces from other Axis nations, notably the Finn [[Ilmari Juutilainen]], the highest-scoring non-German ace. Pilots from Italy, Romania, Croatia, Bulgaria, and Hungary also flew the Bf 109.

The result of the studies was four broad outlines for future aircraft:<ref name=\"Zobel and Mathmann 1995, p. 3\">Zobel and Mathmann 1995, p. 3.</ref>\n*''R\u00fcstungsflugzeug I'' for a multi-seat medium bomber\n*''R\u00fcstungsflugzeug II'' for a tactical bomber\n*''R\u00fcstungsflugzeug III'' for  a single-seat fighter\n*''R\u00fcstungsflugzeug IV'' for a two-seat heavy fighter\n[[File:Me109 clip.ogg|thumb|right|Bf 109 in flight]]\n\n''R\u00fcstungsflugzeug III'' was intended to be a short range interceptor, replacing the [[Arado Ar 64]] and [[Heinkel He 51]] biplanes then in service. In late March 1933 the RLM published the tactical requirements for a single-seat fighter in the document L.A. 1432/33.<ref name=\"Ritger 2006, p. 6\">Ritger 2006, p. 6.</ref>\n\nThe fighter had a top speed of 400&nbsp;km/h (250&nbsp;mph) at 6,000&nbsp;m (19,690&nbsp;ft), which could be maintained for 20 minutes, while having a total flight duration of 90 minutes. The [[critical altitude]] of 6,000 metres could be reached in no more than 17 minutes, and the fighter had an operational ceiling of 10,000 metres.<ref name=\"Ritger 2006, p. 6\" /> Power was to be provided by a [[Junkers Jumo 210]] engine of about 522&nbsp;kW (700&nbsp;hp). It was to be armed with either a single 20&nbsp;mm MG C/30 engine-mounted cannon firing through the propeller hub as a ''Motorkanone'', or two [[Synchronization gear|synchronized]], engine cowl-mounted 7.92&nbsp;mm (.312&nbsp;in) [[MG 17 machine gun]]s, or one lightweight engine-mounted 20&nbsp;mm [[MG FF cannon]] with two 7.92&nbsp;mm MG 17s.<ref>Kobel and Mathmann 1997, p. 3.</ref> The MG C/30 was an airborne adaption of the [[2 cm FlaK 30]] anti-aircraft gun, which fired very powerful [[20x138mmB|\"Long Solothurn\"]] ammunition, but was very heavy and had a low fire rate. It was also specified that the [[wing loading]] should be kept below 100&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The performance was to be evaluated based on  the fighter's level speed, [[rate of climb]], and maneuverability, in that order.<ref name=\"Ritger 2006, p. 6\" />\n<!-- This contradicts a cited statement saying C-Amt were responsible for the specifications; which statement is accurate?...In fact, the R-III  specifications were not actually devised by the C-Amt; in early-1933, both [[Heinkel]] and [[Arado Flugzeugwerke|Arado]] had sent in privately funded designs for a monoplane fighter, and the C-Amt simply collected the best features from both and sent them back out again, adding [[Focke-Wulf]] to the invitation to tender.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}{{Clarify|Which statement is accurate?|date=July 2010}}-->\n\nIt has been suggested that [[Messerschmitt|Bayerische Flugzeugwerke]] (BFW) was originally not invited to participate in the competition due to personal animosity between Willy Messerschmitt and RLM director [[Erhard Milch]];{{#tag:ref|In 1929 Milch, then managing director of [[Deutsche Luft Hansa]] cancelled an order for 10 [[Messerschmitt M20]]b light transport aircraft after Hans Hackman, a close friend of Milch, was killed testing the prototype.<ref>Green 1980, pp. 11\u201312.</ref>|group=nb}} however, recent research by Willy Radinger and Walter Shick indicates that this may not have been the case, as all three competing companies\u2014Arado, Heinkel and BFW\u2014received the development contract for the L.A. 1432/33 requirements at the same time in February 1934.<ref name=\"Ritger 2006, p. 6\" /> A fourth company, Focke-Wulf, received a copy of the development contract only in September 1934.<ref name=\"Ritger 2006, p. 6\" /> The powerplant was to be the new Junkers Jumo 210, but the proviso was made that it would be interchangeable with the more powerful, but less developed [[Daimler-Benz DB 600]] powerplant.<ref>Beaman and Campbell 1980, p. 13.</ref> Each was asked to deliver three prototypes for head-to-head testing in late 1934.\n\n=== Prototypes ===\n[[File:Bf109V1 3Seiten neu.jpg|thumb|Messerschmitt Bf 109 V1]]\n[[File:Bf109V1Zeichnung2.jpg|thumb|A drawing of the V1 prototype]]\n[[File:Messerschmidt Bf109 Prototype V3.png|thumb|Prototype V3]]\nDesign work on Messerschmitt Project Number P.1034 began in March 1934, just three weeks after the development contract was awarded.  The basic mock-up was completed by May, and a more detailed design mock-up was ready by January 1935.  The RLM designated the design as type \"Bf 109,\" the next available from a block of numbers assigned to BFW.<ref name=\"Ritger 2006, p. 6\" />\n\nThe first prototype (''Versuchsflugzeug 1'' or '''V1'''), with civilian registration '''D-IABI''', was completed by May 1935, but the new German engines were not yet ready. To get the \"R III\" designs into the air, the RLM acquired four [[Rolls-Royce Kestrel]] VI engines by trading Rolls-Royce a [[Heinkel He 70]] ''Blitz'' for use as an engine test-bed.{{#tag:ref|This aircraft was instrumental in testing the Rolls-Royce PV-12, later to become the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]]|group=nb}} Messerschmitt received two of these engines and adapted the engine mounts of '''V1''' to take the V-12 engine upright. '''V1''' made its maiden flight at the end of May 1935 at the airfield located in the southernmost Augsburg neighborhood of [[Augsburg-Haunstetten#Involvement in World War II|Haunstetten]], piloted by Hans-Dietrich \"Bubi\" Knoetzsch.  After four months of flight testing, the aircraft was delivered in September to the Luftwaffe's central test centre at the ''Erprobungsstelle'' [[Rechlin-L\u00e4rz Airfield|Rechlin]] to take part in the design competition.\n\nIn 1935, the first Jumo engines became available, so '''V2''' was completed in October using the 449&nbsp;kW (600&nbsp;hp) Jumo 210A engine. '''V3''' followed, the first to be mounted with guns, but it did not fly until May 1936 due to a delay in procuring another Jumo 210 engine.\n\n=== Design competition ===\nAfter Luftwaffe acceptance trials were completed at their headquarters ''Erprobungsstelle'' (''E-Stelle'') military aviation test and development facility at [[Rechlin-L\u00e4rz Airfield|Rechlin]], the prototypes were moved to the subordinate ''E-Stelle'' Baltic seacoast facility at [[Priwall Peninsula|Travem\u00fcnde]] for the head-to-head portion of the competition. The aircraft participating in the trials were the [[Arado Ar 80]] V3, the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 159]] V3, the [[Heinkel He 112]] V4 and the Bf 109 V2. The He 112 arrived first, in early February 1936, followed by the rest of the prototypes by the end of the month.\n\nBecause most fighter pilots of the Luftwaffe were used to [[biplane]]s with open [[cockpit]]s, low wing loading, light [[g-force]]s and easy handling like the [[Heinkel He 51]], they were very critical of the Bf 109 at first. However, it soon became one of the frontrunners in the contest, as the Arado and Focke-Wulf entries, which were intended as \"backup\" programmes to safeguard against failure of the two favourites, proved to be completely outclassed. The Arado Ar 80, with its [[gull wing]] (replaced with a straight, tapered wing on the V3) and fixed, [[Aircraft fairing|spatted]] undercarriage was overweight and underpowered, and the design was abandoned after three prototypes had been built. The [[parasol wing]]ed Fw 159, potentially inspired by the same firm's earlier [[Focke-Wulf Fw 56]], was always considered by the ''E-Stelle'' Travem\u00fcnde facility's staff to be a compromise between a biplane and an aerodynamically more efficient, low-wing monoplane. Although it had some advanced features, it used a novel, complex retractable main undercarriage which proved to be unreliable.<ref>Green 1980, pp. 18\u201321.</ref>\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-337-0036-02A, Im Westen, Feldflugplatz mit Me 109.jpg|thumb|left|''[[JG 53]]'' Bf 109E-3, c. 1939/1940]]\n\nInitially, the Bf 109 was regarded with disfavour by E-Stelle test pilots because of its steep ground angle, which resulted in poor forward visibility when taxiing; the sideways-hinged cockpit canopy, which could not be opened in flight; and the automatic [[leading edge slats]] on the wings which, it was thought, would inadvertently open during aerobatics, possibly leading to crashes. This was later borne out in combat situations and aerobatic testing by various countries' test establishments. The leading edge slats and ailerons would flutter rapidly in fast tight turns, making targeting and control difficult, and eventually putting the aircraft into a stall.  They were also concerned about the high wing loading.<ref>Green 1980, p. 14.</ref>\n\nThe [[Heinkel He 112]], based on a scaled-down [[Heinkel He 70|''Blitz'']], was the favourite of the Luftwaffe leaders. Compared with the Bf 109, it was also cheaper.<ref>Caidin 1968{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> Positive aspects of the He 112 included the wide track and robustness of the undercarriage (this opened outwards from mid wing, as opposed to the 109s which opened from the [[wing root]]), considerably better visibility from the cockpit, and a lower wing loading that made for easier landings. In addition, the V4 had a single-piece, clear-view, sliding cockpit canopy and a more powerful Jumo 210Da engine with a modified exhaust system. However, the He 112 was also structurally complicated, being 18% heavier than the Bf 109, and it soon became clear that the thick wing, which spanned 12.6&nbsp;m (41&nbsp;ft 4&nbsp;in) with an area of 23.2&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> (249.7&nbsp;ft<sup>2</sup>) on the first prototype (V1), was a disadvantage for a light fighter, decreasing the aircraft's rate of roll and manoeuvrability. As a result, the He 112 V4 which was used for the trials had new wings, spanning 11.5&nbsp;m (37&nbsp;ft 8.75&nbsp;in) with an area of 21.6&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> (232.5&nbsp;ft<sup>2</sup>). However, the improvements had not been fully tested and the He 112 V4 could not be demonstrated in accordance with the rules laid down by the Acceptance Commission, placing it at a distinct disadvantage.\n\nBecause of its smaller, lighter [[airframe]], the Bf 109 was 30&nbsp;km/h (20&nbsp;mph) faster than the He 112 in level flight, and superior in climbing and diving. The Commission ultimately ruled in favour of the Bf 109 because of the Messerschmitt test pilot's demonstration of the 109's capabilities during a series of spins, dives, flick rolls and tight turns, throughout which the pilot was in complete control of the aircraft.<ref>Green 1980, pp. 15\u201317.</ref>\n\nIn March, the RLM received news that the British [[Supermarine Spitfire]] had been ordered into production. It was felt that a quick decision was needed to get the winning design into production as soon as possible, so on 12 March, the RLM announced the results of the competition in a document entitled ''Bf 109 Priority Procurement'', which ordered the Bf 109 into production.  At the same time, Heinkel was instructed to radically redesign the He 112.<ref>Feist 1993, p. 14.</ref> The Messerschmitt 109 made its public debut during the [[1936 Berlin Olympics]], when the V1 prototype was flown.<ref name=\"Nowarra 1993, p. 190\">Nowarra 1993, p. 190.</ref>\n\n=== Design features ===\nAs with the earlier Bf 108, the new design was based on Messerschmitt's \"lightweight construction\" principle, which aimed to minimise the number of separate parts in the aircraft. Examples of this could be found in the use of two large, complex brackets which were fitted to the firewall. These brackets incorporated the lower engine mounts and landing gear pivot point into one unit. A large forging attached to the firewall housed the main spar pick-up points, and carried most of the wing loads. Contemporary design practice was usually to have these main load-bearing structures mounted on different parts of the airframe, with the loads being distributed through the structure via a series of strong-points. By concentrating the loads in the firewall, the structure of the Bf 109 could be made relatively light and uncomplicated.<ref>Cross and Scarborough 1976, pp. 56\u201366.</ref>\n\n[[File:Messerschmitt Bf109E-4-B \u20184101 - Black 12\u2019 (DG200) (33115891765).jpg|thumb|A Bf109E at the [[Royal Air Force Museum London]] with its wings temporarily removed, 2016]]\nAn advantage of this design was that the main landing gear, which retracted through an 85-degree angle, was attached to the [[fuselage]], making it possible to completely remove the wings for servicing without additional equipment to support the fuselage. It also allowed simplification of the wing structure, since it did not have to bear the loads imposed during takeoff or landing. The one major drawback of this landing gear arrangement was its narrow [[Track (automobile)|wheel track]], making the aircraft unstable while on the ground. To increase stability, the legs were splayed outward somewhat, creating another problem in that the loads imposed during takeoff and landing were transferred up through the legs at an angle.<ref name=\"Cross and Scarborough, pp. 60\u201361\">Cross and Scarborough 1976, pp. 60\u201361.</ref>\n\nThe small rudder of the Bf 109 was relatively ineffective at controlling the strong swing created by the powerful slipstream of the propeller during the early portion of the takeoff roll, and this sideways drift created disproportionate loads on the wheel opposite to the swing. If the forces imposed were large enough, the pivot point broke and the landing gear leg would collapse outward into its bay.<ref name=\"Cross and Scarborough, pp. 60\u201361\" /> Experienced pilots reported that the swing was easy to control, but some of the less-experienced pilots lost fighters on takeoff.<ref name=\"hannu\" />\n\nBecause of the large ground angle caused by the long legs, forward visibility while on the ground was very poor, a problem exacerbated by the sideways-opening canopy. This meant that pilots had to taxi in a sinuous fashion which also imposed stresses on the splayed undercarriage legs. Ground accidents were a problem with inexperienced pilots, especially during the later stages of the war when pilots received less training before being sent to operational units.<ref name=\"hannu\">Hannu Valtonen \u2014 Messerschmitt Bf 109 ja saksan sotatalous{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> At least 10% of all Bf 109s were lost in takeoff and landing accidents, 1,500 of which occurred between 1939 and 1941.<ref name=\"Boyne 1994, p. 30\">Boyne 1994, p. 30.</ref> The installation of a fixed \"tall\" tailwheel on some of the late G-10s and \u221214s and the K-series helped alleviate the problem to a large extent.<ref>Radinger and Otto 1999, p. 36.</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1980-005-05, Fl\u00fcgel einer Messerschmitt Me 109.jpg|thumb|right|Freely moving, automatic [[leading edge slats]] on a Bf 109E. By using high-lift devices, the handling qualities of the Bf 109 were considerably enhanced.]]\n\nFrom the inception of the design, priority was given to easy access to the powerplant, fuselage weapons and other systems while the aircraft was operating from [[forward airfield]]s. To this end, the entire engine [[cowling]] was made up of large, easily removable panels which were secured by large toggle latches. A large panel under the wing centre section could be removed to gain access to the L-shaped main [[fuel tank]], which was sited partly under the cockpit floor and partly behind the rear cockpit bulkhead. Other, smaller panels gave easy access to the cooling system and electrical equipment.<ref name=\"Cross and Scarborough, pp. 60\u201361\" /> The engine was held in two large, forged, ''[[Elektron (alloy)|Elektron]]'' [[magnesium]] [[alloy]] Y-shaped legs, one per side straddling the engine block, which were [[cantilever]]ed from the firewall. Each of the legs was secured by two quick-release screw fittings on the firewall. All of the main pipe connections were colour-coded and grouped in one place, where possible, and electrical equipment plugged into junction boxes mounted on the firewall. The entire powerplant could be removed or replaced as a unit in a matter of minutes,<ref name=\"Cross and Scarborough, pp. 60\u201361\" /> a potential step to the eventual adoption of the unitized-powerplant ''[[Kraftei]]'' engine mounting concept used by many German combat aircraft designs, later in the war years.\n\nAnother example of the Bf 109's advanced design was the use of a single, I-beam main [[Spar (aviation)|spar]] in the wing, positioned more aft than usual (to give enough room for the retracted wheel), thus forming a stiff D-shaped torsion box. Most aircraft of the era used two spars, near the front and rear edges of the wings, but the D-box was much stiffer [[torsion (mechanics)|torsionally]], and eliminated the need for the rear spar. The wing profile was the NACA 2R1 14.2 at the root and NACA 2R1 11.35 at the tip,<ref>Lednicer, David. [http://www.ae.illinois.edu/m-selig/ads/aircraft.html ''The Incomplete Guide to Airfoil Usage''.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420012244/http://www.ae.illinois.edu/m-selig/ads/aircraft.html |date=20 April 2010 }} Champaign, Illinois: UIUC Applied Aerodynamics Group, 2010. Retrieved: 18 May 2011.</ref> with a thickness to [[Chord (aircraft)|chord]] ratio of 14.2% at the root and 11.35% at the tip.\n\nAnother major difference from competing designs was the higher wing-loading. While the R-IV contract called for a wing-loading of less than 100&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, Messerschmitt felt this was unreasonable. With a low wing-loading and the engines available, a fighter would end up being slower than the bombers it was tasked with catching.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nA fighter was designed primarily for high-speed flight. A smaller wing area was optimal for achieving high speed, but low-speed flight would suffer, as the smaller wing would require more airflow to generate enough lift to maintain flight. To compensate for this, the Bf 109 included advanced [[high-lift device]]s on the wings, including automatically-opening [[leading edge slats]], and fairly large camber-changing [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]] on the [[trailing edge]]. The slats increased the lift of the wing considerably when deployed,<!---link no loner operating<ref>http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Theories_of_Flight/Devices/TH17G2.htm</ref>---> greatly improving the horizontal maneuverability of the aircraft, as several Luftwaffe veterans, such as Erwin Leykauf, attest.<ref>[http://109lair.hobbyvista.com/techref/systems/control/slats/slats.htm] Bf 109 slats explained, ''Bf 109 Lair''.

For this reason, on later Bf 109 F, and K models, the two coolant radiators were equipped with a cut-off system. If one radiator leaked, it was possible to fly on the second, or to fly for at least five minutes with both closed.<ref>Ers\u00e4tzteiliste Bf 109G, pp. 117\u2013118.</ref><ref name=\"Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 12-14\">Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 12-14.</ref><ref name=\"Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 169\">Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 169.</ref><ref>Ers\u00e4tzteiliste Bf 109K, Rumpfwerk, Baugruppe 209.728.</ref><ref name=\"auto\">Drabkin 2007, p. 74.</ref> In 1943, Oberfeldwebel [[Edmund Ro\u00dfmann]] got lost and landed behind Soviet lines. He agreed to show the Soviets how to service the plane. Soviet machine gun technician Viktor M. Sinaisky recalled:\n{{quote|The Messer was a very well designed plane. First, it had an engine of an inverted type, so it could not be knocked out from below. It also had two water radiators with a cut-off system: if one radiator leaked you could fly on the second or close both down and fly at least five minutes more. The pilot was protected by armour-plate from the back, and the fuel tank was also behind armour. Our planes had fuel tanks in the centre of their wings: that's why our pilot got burnt. What else did I like about the Messer? It was highly automatic and thus easy to fly. It also employed an electrical pitch regulator, which our planes didn't have. Our propeller system, with variable pitch was hydraulic, making it impossible to change pitch without engine running. If, God forbid, you turned off the engine at high pitch, it was impossible to turn the propeller and was very hard to start the engine again. Finally, the German ammo counter was also a great thing.<ref name=\"auto\" />}}\n\n=== Armament and gondola cannons ===\n[[File:Messerschmitt Bf 109E.jpg|thumb|right|A cannon-armed Bf 109E, showing the 20&nbsp;mm [[MG FF cannon|MG FF]] installations in the wing.]]\nReflecting Messerschmitt's belief in low-weight, low-drag, simple monoplanes, the armament was placed in the fuselage. This kept the wings very thin and light.  Two [[Synchronization gear|synchronized]] machine guns were mounted in the cowling, firing over the top of the engine and through the propeller arc. An alternative arrangement was also designed, consisting of a single [[autocannon]] firing through a blast tube between the cylinder banks of the engine, known as a ''Motorkanone'' mount in German.<ref name=\"Zobel and Mathmann 1995, p. 3\" /> {{#tag:ref|The engine's mass helped buffer the recoil. British reports on captured DB 601 series engines describe \"a double-walled cannon tube housing\" as part of the [[crankcase]]. Few if any Bf 109s used weapons firing through the propeller hub before the F-series, which mounted 15&nbsp;mm (.59&nbsp;in) and 20&nbsp;mm weapons.<ref>Cross and Scarborough 1976, p. 74.</ref>|group=nb}} This was also the choice of armament layout on some contemporary monoplane fighters, such as the French [[Dewoitine D.520]], or the American [[Bell P-39 Airacobra]], and dated back to [[World War I]]'s small run of [[SPAD S.XII]] ''moteur-canon'', 37&nbsp;mm  cannon-armed fighters in France.\n\nWhen it was discovered in 1937 that the RAF was planning eight-gun batteries for its new [[Hawker Hurricane]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighters, it was decided that the Bf 109 should be more heavily armed. The problem was that the only place available to mount additional guns was in the wings. Only one spot was available in each wing, between the wheel well and slats, with room for only one gun, either a 7.92&nbsp;mm [[MG 17 machine gun]], or a 20&nbsp;mm MG FF or MG FF/M cannon.<ref name=\"Cross and Scarborough 1976, p. 15.\" />\n\nThe first version of the 109 to have wing guns was the C-1, which had one MG 17 in each wing. To avoid redesigning the wing to accommodate large ammunition boxes and access hatches, an unusual ammunition feed was devised whereby a continuous belt holding 500 rounds was fed along chutes out to the wing tip, around a roller and then back along the wing, forward and beneath the gun breech, to the wing root, where it coursed around another roller and back to the weapon.<ref name=\"Cross and Scarborough 1976, p. 15.\">Cross and Scarborough 1976, p. 15.</ref>\n\nThe gun barrel was placed in a long, large-diameter tube located between the spar and the leading edge. The tube channeled cooling air around the barrel and breech, exhausting out of a slot at the rear of the wing. The installation was so cramped that parts of the MG 17's breech mechanism extended into an opening created in the flap structure.<ref name=\"Cross and Scarborough 1976, p. 15.\" />\n\nThe much longer and heavier MG FF had to be mounted farther along the wing in an outer bay. A large hole was cut through the spar allowing the cannon to be fitted with the ammunition feed forward of the spar, while the breech block projected rearward through the spar. A 60-round ammunition drum was placed in a space closer to the wing root causing a bulge in the underside. A small hatch was incorporated in the bulge to allow access for changing the drum. The entire weapon could be removed for servicing by removing a leading edge panel.<ref name=\"Cross and Scarborough 1976, p. 15.\" />\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-487-3066-04, Flugzeug Messerschmitt Me 109.jpg|thumb|right|Luftwaffe ground-crew positioning a Bf 109G-6 equipped with the [[R\u00fcstsatz]] VI underwing gondola cannon kit. Note the slat on the leading edge of the port wing. [[JG 2]], France, late 1943.]]\nFrom the 109F-series onwards, guns were no longer carried inside the wings. Instead, the Bf 109F had a 20&nbsp;mm gun firing through the propeller shaft. The change was disliked by leading fighter pilots such as [[Adolf Galland]] and [[Walter Oesau]], but others such as [[Werner M\u00f6lders]] considered the single nose-mounted gun to compensate well for the loss of the two wing guns.<ref name=\"Deighton 1977, p. 281\">Deighton 1977, p. 281.</ref>  Galland had his Bf 109F-2 field-modified with a 20&nbsp;mm MG FF/M autocannon, the \"/M\" suffix indicating the capability of firing thin-walled 20mm [[Minengescho\u00df|''Minengeschoss'']] shells, installed internally in each wing.{{#tag:ref|Galland also flew another F-2/U1 in which the MG 17s above the engine were replaced by 13&nbsp;mm MG 131s|group=nb}}\n\nIn place of internal wing armament, additional firepower was provided through a pair of 20&nbsp;mm [[MG 151 cannon|MG 151/20 cannons]] installed in conformal [[gun pod]]s under the wings. The conformal gun pods, exclusive of ammunition, weighed 135&nbsp;kg (298&nbsp;lb);<ref name=\"Radinger and Otto 1999, p. 21\">Radinger and Otto 1999, p. 21.</ref> and 135 to 145 rounds were provided per gun. The total weight, including ammunition, was 215&nbsp;kg.<ref name=\"Radinger and Otto 1999, p. 21\" /> Installation of the under-wing gun pods was a simple task that could be quickly performed by the unit's armourers, and the gun pods imposed a reduction of speed of only 8&nbsp;km/h (5&nbsp;mph).<ref name=\"Radinger and Otto 1999, p. 21\" /> By comparison, the installed weight of a similar armament of two 20&nbsp;mm MG 151/20 cannon inside the wings of the Fw 190A-4/U8 was 130&nbsp;kg (287&nbsp;lb), without ammunition.<ref>Hahn 1963, p. 35.</ref>\n\nAlthough the additional armament increased the fighter's potency as a bomber destroyer, it had an adverse effect on the handling qualities, reducing its performance in fighter-versus-fighter combat and accentuating the tendency of the fighter to swing pendulum-fashion in flight.<ref name=\"Deighton 1977, p. 281\"/><ref>Green 1980, p. 88.</ref>\n\nSome of the projected 109K-series models, such as the K-6, were designed to carry 30&nbsp;mm (1.18&nbsp;in) [[MK 108 cannon]]s in the wings.<ref>Prien and Rodeike 1995, p. 177.</ref>\n\n=== Designation and nicknames ===\n{{Main|RLM aircraft designation system#Name changes and new constructors|l1=RLM aircraft designation system}}\nOriginally the aircraft was designated as '''Bf 109''' by the RLM, since the design was submitted by the ''[[Messerschmitt|Bayerische Flugzeugwerke]]'' (literally \"Bavarian Aircraft Works\", meaning \"Bavarian Aircraft Factory\"; sometimes abbreviated B.F.W.,<ref name=\"Flight Oct 5, 1939\">{{cite web|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1939/1939-1-%20-%200932.html|title=''Flight'' (Oct 5, 1939)|author=|date=|website=flightglobal.com}}</ref> akin to [[BMW]]) during 1935.\nThe company was renamed [[Messerschmitt AG]] after [[1938 in aviation#July|'''11 July 1938''']] when [[Erhard Milch]] finally allowed Willy Messerschmitt to acquire the company.

Partly due to its limited 300&nbsp;km (186 mile) combat radius on internal fuel alone, resulting from its 660&nbsp;km (410 mile) range limit, later variants of the E series had a [[Aircraft of the Battle of Britain#German fighter fuel capacity|fuselage ordnance rack]] for fighter-bomber operations or provision for a long-range, standardized 300 litre (79 US gallon) drop-tank and used the DB 601N engine of higher power output.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref>Green 1980, pp. 41\u201345, 63\u201364, 76\u201381, 82\u201383.</ref> The 109E first saw service with the \"[[Condor Legion]]\" during the last phase of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and was the main variant from the beginning of [[World War II]] until mid-1941 when the 109F replaced it in the pure fighter role.<ref>Green 1980, pp. 38\u201339, 80.</ref> (Eight 109Es were assembled in [[Switzerland]] in 1946 by the Dornier-Werke, using licence built airframes; a ninth airframe was assembled using spare parts.)<ref>Green 1980, p. 78.</ref>\n\n[[File:Bf 109 F4 9 JG3 5582.JPG|thumb|Bf 109F-4 of [[JG 3]] near [[Reims]], France]]\n\nThe second big redesign during 1939\u201340 gave birth to the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109 variants#Bf_109F|F series]]. The ''Friedrich'' had new wings, cooling system and fuselage aerodynamics, with the 1,175 PS (1,159 HP) DB 601N (F-1, F-2) or the 1,350 PS (1,332 HP) DB 601E (F-3, F-4). Considered by many as the high-water mark of Bf 109 development, the F series abandoned the wing cannon and concentrated all armament in the forward fuselage with a pair of synchronized machine guns above and a single 15 or 20&nbsp;mm ''Motorkanone''-mount cannon behind the engine, the latter firing between the cylinder banks and through the propeller hub, itself covered by a more streamlined, half-elliptical shaped spinner that better matched the streamlining of the reshaped cowling, abandoning the smaller, conical spinner of the ''Emil'' subtype. The F-type also omitted the earlier stabilizer [[lift strut]] on either side of the tail. The improved aerodynamics were used by all later variants. Some Bf 109Fs were used late in the [[Battle of Britain]] in 1940 but the variant came into common use only in the first half of 1941.<ref>Prien and Rodeike 1996, pp. 9\u201325.</ref>\n\n[[File:Bf 109G-10 cockpit 070703-F-1234S-001.jpg|thumb|left|Bf 109 Gustav cockpit]]\nThe [[Messerschmitt Bf 109 variants#Bf 109G|G series]], or ''Gustav'', was  introduced in mid-1942. Its initial variants (G-1 through G-4) differed only in minor details from the Bf 109F, most notably in the more powerful 1,475 [[Pferdest\u00e4rke|PS]] (1,455 HP) [[Daimler-Benz DB 605|DB 605]] engine. Odd-numbered variants were built as high-altitude fighters with a pressurized cockpit and [[GM-1]] boost, while even-numbered variants were un-pressurized, air superiority fighters and fighter-bombers. Long-range [[photo-reconnaissance]] variants also existed. The later G series (G-5 through G-14) was produced in a multitude of variants, with uprated armament and provision for kits of packaged, generally factory-installed parts known as ''Umr\u00fcst-Baus\u00e4tze'' (usually contracted to ''Umbau'') and adding a \"/U\" suffix to the aircraft designation when installed. Field kits known as [[R\u00fcstsatz|''R\u00fcsts\u00e4tze'']] were also available for the G-series but those did not change the aircraft title. By early 1944, tactical requirements resulted in the addition of [[MW-50]] water injection boost and high-performance [[superchargers]], boosting engine output to 1,800\u20132,000 PS (1,775\u20131,973 HP). From early 1944, some G-2s, G-3s, G-4s and G-6s were converted to two-seat trainers, known as G-12s. An instructor's cockpit was added behind the original cockpit and both were covered by an elongated, glazed canopy.<ref>Prien and Rodeike 1996, pp. 56\u2013165.</ref>\n\nThe final production version of the Bf 109 was the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109 variants#Bf 109K|K series]] or ''Kurf\u00fcrst'', introduced in late 1944, powered by the DB 605D engine with up to 2,000 PS (1,973 HP). Though externally akin to the late production Bf 109G series, a large number of internal changes and aerodynamic improvements were incorporated that improved its effectiveness and remedied flaws, keeping it competitive with the latest Allied and Soviet fighters.<ref name=\"Radinger and Otto 1999, pp. 35\u201337\" /><ref>Prien and Rodeike 1996, pp. 166\u2013174.</ref> The Bf 109's outstanding rate of climb was superior to many Allied adversaries including the P-51D Mustang, Spitfire Mk.

By September 1939, the Bf 109 had become the main fighter of the Luftwaffe, replacing the biplane fighters, and was instrumental in gaining air superiority for the [[Wehrmacht]] during the early stages of the war. During the [[Battle of Britain]], it was pressed into the role of escort fighter, a role for which it was not originally designed, and it was widely employed as a [[fighter-bomber]], as well as a [[photo-reconnaissance]] platform. Despite mixed results over Britain, with the introduction of the improved Bf 109F in early 1941, the type again proved to be an effective fighter during the [[Invasion of Yugoslavia]] (where it was used by both sides), the [[Battle of Crete]], [[Operation Barbarossa]], the invasion of the [[USSR]], and the [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|Siege of Malta]].\n\nIn 1942, it began to be partially replaced in Western Europe by a new German fighter, the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]], but it continued to serve in a multitude of roles on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] and in the [[Defense of the Reich]], as well as in the [[Mediterranean Theatre of Operations]] and with [[Erwin Rommel]]'s [[Afrikakorps]]. It was also supplied to several of Germany's allies, including Italy, Finland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and Slovakia.\n\nMore aerial kills were made with the Bf 109 than any other aircraft of World War II.<ref name=\"Feist 1993, p. 50\" /> Many of the aerial victories were accomplished against poorly trained and badly organized Soviet forces in 1941 during [[Operation Barbarossa]]. The Soviets lost 21,200 aircraft at this time, about half to combat.<ref>Bergstr\u00f6m, Christer. ''Barbarossa \u2013 The Air Battle: July\u2013December 1941'', p. 117.

Later in the war, when Allied victories began to bring the fight closer, and then to German territory, bombing raids supplied plenty of targets for the Luftwaffe.  This unique combination of events \u2014 until [[Jimmy Doolittle#Doolittle's breakthrough in fighter tactics|a major change in American fighter tactics]] occurred very early in 1944, that steadily gave the Allies daylight [[air supremacy]] over the Reich \u2014 led to the highest-ever individual pilot victory scores.<ref>Toliver, Raymond F.; Constable, Trevor J.

The Swiss used their Bf 109Gs well into the 1950s. The Finnish Air Force did not retire their Bf 109Gs until March 1954. Romania used its Bf 109s until 1955. The Spanish Hispanos flew even longer. Some were still in service in the late 1960s. They appeared in films (notably ''[[Battle of Britain (film)|Battle of Britain]]'') playing the role of Bf 109Es.

It also attacked enemy observation balloons, and perform close air support and tactical bombing attacks of enemy forces along the front lines.<ref name=\"MaurerwwI\">[http://www.afhso.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101013-007.pdf Maurer, Maurer (1978), The US Air Service in World War I, The Office of Air Force History, Headquarters USAF Washington]</ref>\n\nThe unit achieved a number of \"firsts\".  It was the first United States Aero Squadron sent to Canada to be trained by the British; the first squadron to be completely trained prior to be sent overseas with its complete quota of trained pilots; the first squadron to be attached to British Royal Air Force squadrons and the first to be sent into combat.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nIn October 1918, the squadron was transferred to the [[United States Second Army]] [[4th Pursuit Group]].   However, with Second Army's planned offensive drive on [[Metz]] cancelled due to the [[1918 Armistice with Germany]], the squadron saw no combat with Second Army.   It returned to the United States and was demobilized on 1 April 1919 as part of the demobilization of the Air Service after the war.<ref name=\"Maurer\">{{cite book|editor=Maurer, Maurer|title=Combat Squadrons of the Air Force, World War II|origyear=1969|url= http://media.defense.gov/2010/Dec/02/2001329899/-1/-1/0/AFD-101202-002.pdf |edition= reprint|year=1982|publisher=Office of Air Force History|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-405-12194-6|oclc=72556|lccn=70605402}}</ref><ref name=\"OOB\">Order of Battle of the United States Land Forces in the First World War, Volume 3, Part 3, Center of Military History, United States Army, 1949 (1988 Reprint)</ref>\n\nOn 17 October 1936, the World War I Aero squadron was consolidated with the [[United States Army Air Corps]] 17th Pursuit Squadron to preserve the lineage and history of the unit.  Today, the [[United States Air Force]] [[17th Weapons Squadron]] flies the [[F-15E Strike Eagle]] at [[Nellis Air Force Base]], Nevada.<ref name=\"AFHRA\">[http://www.afhra.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=9849 AFHRA 17th Bomb Squadron] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225175157/http://www.afhra.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=9849 |date=25 February 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Formation and initial training===\nThe squadron was first organized as \"Company A\", [[Remount Station]], [[Fort Sam Houston]], Texas, on 13 May 1917, about a month after the declaration of war by President [[Woodrow Wilson]]. It was later re-designated \"Company M\", and later, \"Company B\". On 16 June, it again was re-designated as the '''29th Provisional Aero Squadron, Aviation Section, Signal Corps''', and then on 30 July, the '''17th Aero Squadron'''. It was made of entirely of volunteers, and the majority of the unit had enlisted in the Army believing they would be flying officers. Unit members came from thirty-five states, Puerto Rico, Canada, and Mexico, and they were among the first to arrive at the new Kelly Field. The initial duties of the squadron consisted of surveying and building the first sewage and water system, and the first barracks and hangars of the new airfield.<ref name=\"Gorrell\">Series \"E\", Volume 4, Histories of the 16th, 17th and 19th\u201320th Aero Squadrons. Gorrell's History of the American Expeditionary Forces Air Service, 1917\u20131919, National Archives, Washington, D.C.</ref>\n\nOn 2 August, the squadron was ordered to [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada for training under the British [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC).  The previous month, a reciprocal agreement was made between the British and American governments under which the British would organize and train at the RFC's camps near Toronto the pilots and mechanics of ten Aero squadrons for overseas service.  The 17th Aero Squadron was the first group to arrive under that agreement. The squadron arrived on 4 August at the recruit's depot at [[Leaside]], Ontario.  Here the men underwent three weeks of British drill and discipline.   Then, the squadron was divided into detachments and went on to other camps in the area for training in rigging and fitting and all the trades involved in maintaining airplanes.   The gunners and radio operators went to the School of Military Aeronautics at Toronto University; six went to the motor transport depot; seventy-five went to the RFC Airplane Repair Park; six to the flying field at [[Desoronto]] for training under the 43d Wing, RFC, and ninety-nine men went on to further training at Leaside.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nIn early October, the squadron was re-assembled at Leaside. New orders were received and the 17th was transferred to [[Camp Taliaferro]], near [[Fort Worth]], Texas on 12 October, for additional RFC training, although an advance party of twenty men had left for the same destination on 24 September.   The squadron was assigned to Hicks Field, which afterward was given designation Taliaferro Field #1.  Upon arrival, the airfield was in an unfinished state.  The barracks were unfinished and the hangars for the airplanes were still to be built.  Both officers and men lived in tents from which they had to chase an occasional tarantula. There was no telephones, no electricity and no transport. The training airplanes were still un-assembled in packing crates, and supplies were just beginning to arrive.   However, within a week, the training aircraft, [[Curtiss JN-4]] Jennies had been uncrated, assembled and flying.  The flying cadets, who had been instructed in primary training during their time at Desoronto, were taught further details of flying. By 1 December, thirty cadets had completed their training and received commissions as [[First Lieutenant]]s.  The squadron's equipment has been received and on 20 December, the squadron received its overseas movement orders and departed for [[Garden City, New York]] for deployment.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nUpon arrival in Garden City, it found New York in the grip of a coal shortage and a severe cold streak of weather.  For two weeks, sailing was held up. The squadron was finally allowed to embark on 9 January at New York Haber pier 54 on the [[RMS Carmania (1905)|RMS ''Carmania'']], a former [[Cunard]] ocean liner that had been impressed as a troop ship. The Carmania sailed as part of a convoy of fourteen ships.  Everything went according to schedule, and the ship arrived in [[Liverpool, England]] on 25 January.  After disembarking, the squadron was marched from the docks to the Liverpool railway station where it boarded a [[London and North Western Railway]] train which took them to [[Winchester, Hampshire]], near the south coast of England. Arriving in the late afternoon the squadron was moved to the Romsey Rest Camp.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nPrior to leaving the United States, the squadron was informed that they were the first United States pursuit squadron to be deployed overseas; that they were well trained and organized; and the men were eager to do their part in the war. However now they were told by the British officers at Romsey that the squadron would be again split up into Flights and scatter the unit among Royal Flying Corps units in France for more training.  It was arranged that each flight, would be attached to a separate RFC fighting squadron for duty and final training, while the pilots would be sent to various flying schools in Great Britain.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\n===Training in France===\nAfter a month of confusion and very uncomfortable living conditions at Romsey on 9 February 1918, the Ground Echelon of the squadron sailed from [[Southampton]] for [[Le Havre]], Upper Normandy, France, with a shipload of mules and horses.  After landing, the squadron was met by a British officer and the Flights were sent off to their various destinations. Headquarters Flight was assigned to [[No. 24 Squadron RAF|24 Squadron]] at [[Matigny]] in the [[Somme (department)|Somme]]; \"A\" Flight to [[No. 84 Squadron RAF|84 Squadron]] at [[Guizancourt]], also in the Somme; \"B\" to [[No. 60 Squadron RAF|60 Squadron]] at Ste. Marie Capelle, near [[Hazebrouck]] on the [[Flanders]] front; and \"C\" to [[No. 56 Squadron RAF|56 Squadron]] at [[Baizieux Airdrome]] in [[Somme (department)|Somme]].  All left at once except \"B\" Flight which followed on the 10th.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nThanks to the training the men received in the United States, the men of the 17th knew their aircraft well enough to be a help rather than a hindrance to the squadrons to which they were attached.  Also, both officers and men realized they were a part of an experiment in training squadrons in the field, and that, with their ability to get on well with the British, the future of this method of training in no small measure depended for the following units coming from the United States.  The 17th was completely detached from the United States [[Army Air Service]]; its flights were totally out of touch with each other.  Occasionally an American officer would come by for an hour or so, at widely scattered intervals, to see how well they were \"getting on\".  Each flight relied on the British for all of its necessary resources, including clothing and transport.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nAs a result of the German [[Spring Offensive]], all of the Flights, with the exception of \"B\", were still at the Airdromes they were assigned originality.  \"B\" Flight had moved to [[Bailleul, Nord|Bailleul Airdrome]] on the Somme, where it and 60 Squadron where it came under shell fire from the advancing German Army, although it suffered no casualties. On 23 March, the Squadron moved to La Bellevue, near [[Arras]], Pas-de-Calais, while the Flight left for Fienvillers, Somme, on 28 March, where the Squadron had arrived the previous day. All of the Flights were now on the front involved in defending the line against the Germans and from the end of March, all Flights took part in a succession of movements carried out in the face of the enemy advance.  The men of the 17th helped build new Airdromes; break them down and build still others as the British Army moved back.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nHeadquarters Flight began moving on the first day of the German Attack (21 March) when 24 Squadron moved from Matigny less than two hours before the Germans reached it, and some squadron members were still burning the quarters and hangars.  While doing so, advance soldiers of the Germans had reached the airfield and they were under machine-gun fire.  From Matigny, the Flight and Squadron moved to [[Bertangles]]; then from Bertangles to [[Conteville, Somme|Conteville]].<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nAt Guizancourt, \"A\" Flight had received enemy artillery fire, and along with 64 Squadron had moved to Champien Aerodrome, near [[Roye, Somme|Roye]]; the last man got away only an hour and a half before the Germans arrived.  From Roye it moved to La ferme du Vert Galand aerodrome on 24 March and then to [[Conteville, Somme|Conteville]], been billeted in Maison-Ponthieu on 29 March.  By the time the front was held, \"A\", without 64 Squadron, only made one more move on 5 April to Bertangles.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nThe other two flights had much the same experience.  \"B\" Flight had come down from Flanders to Bellevue with 60 Squadron just in time to stand by to move.   All the British Squadrons supplies and property were divided up so that, if the need arose, they could be destroyed quickly in the order of their importance.  Nothing, in spite of the danger, was lost.  The Flight and Squadron moved to Fienvillers on 28 March where they remained until 18 April when it moved again to Boffles aerodrome, setting camp at [[Rougefay]].   \"C\" Flight moved only one time on 26 March from [[Baizieux]] to La ferme du Valheureux, near Candas.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nDuring the three months of the German offensive, the RAF experienced the busiest and most dangerous times it had ever known, and during this period, the men of the 17th Aero Squadron learned much more than the maintenance of aircraft.  They learned what it meant to send out patrols and move frequently from one airdrome to another at the same time.   The knowledge that it gained in actual experience was more valuable than the knowledge they gained working with the RAF in maintaining aircraft.  This became invaluable when the 17th began operating as an American unit with the RAF and word came in the middle of the night to move in five hours, they were fully capable of the task.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nOn 18 May it was decided that the Americans should be assigned to [[Sopwith Camel]] units.  The mechanics would be given a month to master their overhaul and upkeep.  Headquarters and \"A\" flights were assigned to [[No. 23 Squadron RAF|23 Squadron]], then to [[No. 60 Squadron RAF|60 Squadron]]; \"B\" Flight was assigned to [[No. 46 Squadron RAF|46 Squadron]] and \"C\" Flight to [[No. 3 Squadron RAF|3 squadron]].  The men learned rapidly, and on 20 {{not a typo|June the 17th}} Aero Squadron was re-assembled at [[Petite Synthe Aerodrome]], near [[Dunkirk]], to become a combat squadron and resume its identity as a squadron.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\n===RAF combat operations===\n====Petite Synthe====\nAt Petite Synthe Airdrome the 17th received its official insignia, secret at the time, a white Dumbbell painted on each side of the fuselage aft of the cockpit.  Later, in anticipation of its return to American command, the squadron adopted its own symbol, the \"Great Snow Owl\".  However, it was with the Dumbbell that the squadron engaged in combat. The squadron was assigned to the 65 Wing, Royal Air Force for operations.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/> However, [[No. 19 Squadron RAF]] also used the same basic form of \"dumbbell\" squadron marking, albeit with slightly larger circles at each end, on its own [[Sopwith Dolphin]] fighters from November 1917 onward through the summer of 1918, and is believed to have used them on its Dolphins right up to Armistice Day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rafweb.org/Squadrons/Sqn%20Markings/SqnMark019A.htm |title=Air of Authority \u2013 A History of RAF Organisation \u2013 No 19 Squadron Aircraft & Markings 1916\u20131931 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=9 November 2018 |website=www.rafweb.org |publisher=rafweb.org |access-date=21 April 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Franks |first=Norman |date=2002 |title=Osprey Aircraft of the Aces #48 \u2013 Dolphin and Snipe Aces of World War 1 |location=Oxford, UK |publisher=Osprey Publishing Ltd. |pages=27\u201328, 34\u201336, 62 |isbn=1-84176-317-9 }}</ref>\n\nAfter several weeks of familiarization flights, the 17th Aero Squadron entered combat on 15 July 1918 for the first time.  The front was very quiet.  Lt. Rodney D. Williams brought down its first enemy airplane not far from [[Ostend]], Belgium about 09:45 on 20 July when the squadron encountered a formation of five German Fokker biplanes at approximately 21,000 feet.  Several bursts of machine-gun fire were fired at a rather long range at two different aircraft, and one German aircraft seemed to be hit as a tracer bullet exploded in the fuselage behind the pilot, however the plane went down under control.   Another Fokker dove on Lt. Williams, firing short bursts.  He maneuvered so he was about twenty-five yards to the enemy pilot's left rear and gave him a burst of forty or fifty bullets which appeared to strike the enemy plane at the pilot's seat.  The enemy plane then turned on its back then fell out of the sky apparently out of control.   That same day, the first casualty of the war was suffered by the squadron, when Lt. George Glenn was seen diving deeply south of Ostend after being attacked by a German [[Fokker D.VII]].<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nFrom Petite Snythe Airdrome, the squadron engaged in combat operations almost daily afterward, frequently engaging German aircraft in aerial battles over the skies of northern France and Belgium.  Missions included escorting RAF bomber squadrons attacking enemy positions in occupied areas.   A major attack on a German airfield in Belgium, at Vessanaere, near [[Bruges]] was carried out with the RAF [[No. 210 Squadron RAF|210]] and [[No. 213 Squadron RAF|213]] bomb squadrons.  The 17th rendezvoused with the squadrons over the English Channel and once assembled, the 17th was to provide cover from enemy aircraft interceptors.   After several postponements, the attack was carried out on 13 August. The 17th took off before dawn and in conjunction with the RAF 5th Group squadrons, the bombers attacked the airfield from a low level, then proceeded to shoot at hangars and huts on the aerodrome. A gasoline dump was set on fire with six Fokker biplanes being set on fire on the ground, with an additional two being hit directly by bombs.   Two hangars sere set on fire and another one severely damaged.   The 17th circled the airdrome and attacked enemy aircraft and ground personnel preparing them to take off.   The 17th claimed seven enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground.   Later, it was confirmed that the raid destroyed a total of fourteen enemy aircraft.  Many of the attacking aircraft were hit by ground fire but all managed to return without loss.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\n====Auxi-le-Chateau====\nOn 18 {{not a typo|August the 17th}} was ordered to move to Auxi-le-Chateau Airdrome.  The word came at 23:00 and the squadron pulled out at dawn.   They arrived the next day, and were settled in enough to send the first combat patrol over the lines on 21 August, shooting down four enemy aircraft.   The [[Chateau Thierry offensive]] was in full swing, with the squadron flying low bombing patrols, attacking gas balloons and infantry with their machine guns.   Each pilot went on two patrols each day from dawn until disk.   On 23 August, Lt. Williams was hit in the back and his petrol tank was pierced by enemy machine gun fire.  Despite his wound, he put his finger in the petrol tank to plug the leak, then was able to land his aircraft successfully.  The squadron over the next few days shot down one enemy gas balloon each day, with the exception of the 23d when they were put on low bombing dive and strafing missions all day.   Attacks on the enemy was largely concentrated in the vicinity of Cambrai, but the congestion on the roads behind his lines presented opportunities for much greater damage to his morale by attacking trucks and troops on the highway from altitudes of less than a few hundred feet.   When flying the low-level attacks, the 17th relied on other squadrons patrolling higher up to look out for the enemy's Fokkers, while the squadron received ground fire from the enemy below.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\n26 August was the squadron's most tragic day.  It had rained during the night and a gusty wind had begun to blow at dawn and was getting stronger and gustier.   Low clouds, with gaps of blue between them moved in from the southwest.    The squadron was called for a patrol about 16:30 with a mission to attack a lot of enemy on the lines and some friendly \"low-straffers\" in trouble on the Bapaume-Cambrai road.    The squadron took off and upon reaching the lines, shot down an enemy balloon, On crossing the line, five Fokkers were seen attacking friendly forces on the line.   Immediately afterwards, a Camel was seen being attacked by the five Fokkers at a height of about 1,000 feet.   The patrol at once went to the assistance of the Camel and attacked the enemy aircraft.   Several other flights of Fokkers were then seen diving from the clouds.   A general engagement took place in which still other flights of Fokkers came down from higher altitudes.  Six 17th pilots were shot down and another only just succeed in getting back to the Auxi Airdrome with a number of Fokkers on his tail and firing continuously.   All of the downed pilots (William Tipton, Robert Todd, Henry Frost, Laurence Roberts, Henry Jackson, and Howard Bittinger) were given up for loss, but about a month later a post card was sent from William Tipton that he, Robert Todd and Henry Frost had survived, along with George Wise who was captured on 24 August. However, Henry Frost had died of his wounds. The post card also confirmed that the patrol had downed three German planes, of which Tipton was credited for two and Todd one.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/><ref>Clapp, Frederick M. History of the 17th Aero Squadron, Garden City, NY: Country Life Press, December 1920</ref>\n\nAfter the losses that day, the RAF kept the squadron out of combat for about a week.   Several new aircraft arrived along with some new pilots being assigned.  While the squadron operated from the Auxi Airdrome, often in conjunction with the 148th Aero Squadron, the line moved east rapidly and it was necessary for the squadron to establish an Advanced Landing Ground at Beugnatre on 10 September from which the squadron took up wireless interception and devoted itself to attacking enemy two-seater observation aircraft.   A detail of mechanics were sent to Beugnatre and several hangars were erected.  Beugnatre was a former British Airdrome that had been captured by the Germans and was severely damaged during its occupation.  The fields were a mess of shell holes, rusty Nissen huts lined the road which were riddled by machine gun holes and had caved in.    The ground mechanics and crew managed to fill in the shell holes and operations by the squadron flew from dusk to dawn until 20 September.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\n====Soncamp====\nWith the line advancing east and north, the squadron was again ordered to move to an airdrome near [[Doullens]] which was being vacated by No. 12 Squadron on 20 September.   The day was cold and rainy with low clouds, however the aircraft took off and the trucks were loaded with stores and other equipment. Soncamp Aerodrome occupied the north side of a farm house, south of the typical French farming village of [[Sombrin]], Pas-de-Calais. The farm buildings were enclosed in a large stone wall, perhaps the relic of a small convent, with a high archway into a farmyard. The hangars were permanent and of camouflaged corrugated iron. There were good huts as barracks for the enlisted men.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nFlight operations begin on the 22d, and on the first morning patrol, fifteen Fokkers were seen diving on the squadron's \"C\" flight, outnumbering them five-to-one.   The 17th's pilots, however, returned their fire and eventually about thirty aircraft were engaged in the aerial battle and downed six enemy aircraft.    A Lt Tillinghast, was shot down in the battle.   He turned up later in [[London]] with a remarkable story of how he was captured by the Germans and taken to a house in the rear of their lines.    Being locked up in a room, he managed to escape through a hole in the roof and made his way from [[Valenciennes]] to [[Belgium]], where he obtained a suit of civilian clothing.   Friendly Belgians moved him from one home to another at night on an underground railway.   Finally he reached [[Brussels]], where he moved freely on the streets.  He even went to the length, it seems, of taking a streetcar ride to a neighboring German Aerodrome that he inspected carefully and at length.  Somewhere in Brussels he became friends with a Belgian engineer who ran the electric plant from which the current for charging the frontier wire barrier was generated.   The engineer let him into all his official secrets and gave him a clippers and wire gloves.   Having set the hour of his crossing over, the engineer gave him final instructions about making good his escape and managed to cross over onto our side of the line.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nAs the army kept moving forward, the line changed from day to day.  The army was battling on the [[Canal du Nord]], the [[Hindenburg Line]], the [[Canal de l'Escaut]] and [[Cambrai]].   The 17th was in combat each and every day during the [[Battle of Cambrai (1918)|battle]] there, carrying out bombing missions and strafing enemy forces on the ground from low-level.  As the [[Battle of Cambrai (1918)|Battle for Cambrai]] progressed, the squadron's patrols would attack large formations of enemy Fokkers by ambushing them in the clouds, or bait them by trying to pull them over friendly territory.  The Germans also did the same to the squadron, as the German pilots were very aggressive and frequently the squadron wound up in air-to-air combat with them.   The enemy were very good pilots and, as the squadron found out later, were one of the most famous of the German organizations and well known for their exploits on other fronts.   On 24 September a formation of fourteen 17th aircraft saw, rather far off, an enemy formation of thirteen.   A short while later two enemy two-seater observation planes were spotted and several of the squadron's aircraft dived down on them.  However, it turned out they were 'bait' as shortly afterwards, a formation of sixteen Fokkers dived down on them without warning, while another flight of enemy aircraft waited for their best moment to pounce on the rest of the squadron.   Four of the 17th's aircraft had their guns jam, however, ten others attacked the enemy and shot down five and another was driven out of control with no losses.   Later, the 148th attacked the same flight of Fokkers, or what remained of them and shot down six more enemy aircraft.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nDuring the greater part of October, the squadron brought \"great discomfort\" to the enemy in many ways, and broke up the organization of his retreat towards the German frontier in spite of low clouds and a drizzling rain on many days.  The squadron reported much materiel to British Intelligence which made it possible for ground units to attack in his weakest spots.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\n====Transfer to the AEF====\nOn 25 October, the squadron was again ordered to prepare itself to move.   [[Estourmel]] was selected as an Advanced Landing Ground and Exnes as the site of a new Aerodrome.   However, new orders were received that the squadron was to \"go south\" which meant being transferred to the American sector and joining the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] (AEF).   The news had a mixed reception, as the squadron wanted naturally to join its own forces, however, the squadron had been quite happy fighting with the RAF forces and learned their game and how to play it well.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nThe order came to turn in all British supplies and prepare to depart.  This included the squadron's Sopwith Camels, as the squadron would be re-equipped by the AEF.   RAF Major General [[Charles Longcroft]], flew over in his Camel and assembled the entire squadron in a hangar.   He walked the ranks and spoke to many of the men and asked what their work had been in America and what they did as part of the squadron.  He then read to all a letter from General [[Julian Byng]], commander of the [[British Third Army]] expressing to the squadron his sincere appreciation for their excellent and hard work.  The moment was impressive.  Afterward, General Longcroft came to the Officer's mess and thanked each and every pilot and officer for their efforts in behalf of the Royal Air Force.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nOn 1 November the squadron entrained on the railhead at [[Saulty]], proceeding on the long trip to [[Toul]] in the American Sector.  On its arrival, the 17th Aero Squadron was assigned to the [[4th Pursuit Group]] and was assigned to [[Toul-Croix de Metz Airfield|Croix de Metz Aerodrome]] on the north side of the city.   The AEF assigned French [[SPAD S.XI]] aircraft to the squadron, but before the squadron was fully organized, the armistice with Germany was signed on 11 November and active operations by the squadron ended.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\n====Demobilization====\nOn 12 December 1918 orders were received from First Army for the squadron to report to the 1st Air Depot, [[Colombey-les-Belles Airdrome]] to turn in all of its supplies and equipment and was relieved from duty with the AEF. The squadron's SPAD aircraft were delivered to the American Air Service Acceptance Park No. 1 at [[Orly Air Base|Orly Aerodrome]] to be returned to the French.  There practically all of the pilots and observers were detached from the Squadron.<ref name=\"Demob\">Series \"D\", Weekly Statistical Reports of Air Service Activities, October 1918 \u2013 May 1919.

It also attacked enemy observation balloons, and perform close air support and tactical bombing attacks of enemy forces along the front lines.<ref name=\"MaurerwwI\">[http://www.afhso.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101013-007.pdf Maurer, Maurer (1978), The US Air Service in World War I, The Office of Air Force History, Headquarters USAF Washington]</ref>\n\nThe unit achieved a number of \"firsts\".  It was the first United States Aero Squadron sent to Canada to be trained by the British; the first squadron to be completely trained prior to be sent overseas with its complete quota of trained pilots; the first squadron to be attached to British Royal Air Force squadrons and the first to be sent into combat.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nIn October 1918, the squadron was transferred to the [[United States Second Army]] [[4th Pursuit Group]].   However, with Second Army's planned offensive drive on [[Metz]] cancelled due to the [[1918 Armistice with Germany]], the squadron saw no combat with Second Army.   It returned to the United States and was demobilized on 1 April 1919 as part of the demobilization of the Air Service after the war.<ref name=\"Maurer\">{{cite book|editor=Maurer, Maurer|title=Combat Squadrons of the Air Force, World War II|origyear=1969|url= http://media.defense.gov/2010/Dec/02/2001329899/-1/-1/0/AFD-101202-002.pdf |edition= reprint|year=1982|publisher=Office of Air Force History|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-405-12194-6|oclc=72556|lccn=70605402}}</ref><ref name=\"OOB\">Order of Battle of the United States Land Forces in the First World War, Volume 3, Part 3, Center of Military History, United States Army, 1949 (1988 Reprint)</ref>\n\nOn 17 October 1936, the World War I Aero squadron was consolidated with the [[United States Army Air Corps]] 17th Pursuit Squadron to preserve the lineage and history of the unit.

It was later re-designated \"Company M\", and later, \"Company B\". On 16 June, it again was re-designated as the '''29th Provisional Aero Squadron, Aviation Section, Signal Corps''', and then on 30 July, the '''17th Aero Squadron'''. It was made of entirely of volunteers, and the majority of the unit had enlisted in the Army believing they would be flying officers. Unit members came from thirty-five states, Puerto Rico, Canada, and Mexico, and they were among the first to arrive at the new Kelly Field. The initial duties of the squadron consisted of surveying and building the first sewage and water system, and the first barracks and hangars of the new airfield.<ref name=\"Gorrell\">Series \"E\", Volume 4, Histories of the 16th, 17th and 19th\u201320th Aero Squadrons. Gorrell's History of the American Expeditionary Forces Air Service, 1917\u20131919, National Archives, Washington, D.C.</ref>\n\nOn 2 August, the squadron was ordered to [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada for training under the British [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC).  The previous month, a reciprocal agreement was made between the British and American governments under which the British would organize and train at the RFC's camps near Toronto the pilots and mechanics of ten Aero squadrons for overseas service.  The 17th Aero Squadron was the first group to arrive under that agreement. The squadron arrived on 4 August at the recruit's depot at [[Leaside]], Ontario.  Here the men underwent three-week's British drill and discipline.   Then, the squadron was divided into detachments and went on to other camps in the area for training in rigging and fitting and all the trades involved in maintaining airplanes.   The gunners and radio operators went to the School of Military Aeronautics at Toronto University; six went to the motor transport depot; seventy-five went to the RFC Airplane Repair Park; six to the flying field at [[Desoronto]] for training under the 43d Wing, RFC, and ninety-nine men went on to further training at Leaside.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nIn early October, the squadron was re-assembled at Leaside. New orders were received and the 17th was transferred to [[Camp Taliaferro]], near [[Fort Worth]], Texas on 12 October, for additional RFC training, although an advance party of twenty men had left for the same destination on 24 September.   The squadron was assigned to Hicks Field, which afterwards was given designation Taliaferro Field #1.  Upon arrival, the airfield was in an unfinished state.  The barracks were unfinished and the hangars for the airplanes were still to be built.  Both officers and men lived in tents from which they had to chase an occasional tarantula. There was no telephones, no electricity and no transport. The training airplanes were still un-assembled in packing crates, and supplies were just beginning to arrive.   However, within a week, the training aircraft, [[Curtiss JN-4]] Jennies had been uncrated, assembled and flying.  The flying cadets, who had been instructed in primary training during their time at Desoronto, were taught further details of flying. By 1 December, thirty cadets had completed their training and received commissions as [[First Lieutenant]]s.  The squadron's equipment has been received and on 20 December, the squadron received its overseas movement orders and departed for [[Garden City, New York]] for deployment.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nUpon arrival in Garden City, it found New York in the grip of a coal shortage and a severe cold streak of weather.  For two weeks, sailing was held up. The squadron was finally allowed to embark on 9 January at New York Haber pier 54 on the [[RMS Carmania (1905)|RMS ''Carmania'']], a former [[Cunard]] ocean liner that had been impressed as a troop ship. The Carmania sailed as part of a convoy of fourteen ships.  Everything went according to schedule, and the ship arrived in [[Liverpool, England]] on 25 January.  After disembarking, the squadron was marched from the docks to the Liverpool railway station where it boarded a [[London and North Western Railway]] train which took them to [[Winchester, Hampshire]], near the south coast of England. Arriving in the late afternoon the squadron was moved to the Romsey Rest Camp.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nPrior to leaving the United States, the squadron was informed that they were the first United States pursuit squadron to be deployed overseas; that they were well trained and organized; and the men were eager to do their part in the war. However now they were told by the British officers at Romsey that the squadron would be again split up into Flights and scatter the unit among Royal Flying Corps units in France for more training.  It was arranged that each flight, would be attached to a separate RFC fighting squadron for duty and final training, while the pilots would be sent to various flying schools in Great Britain.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\n===Training in France===\nAfter a month of confusion and very uncomfortable living conditions at Romsey on 9 February 1918, the Ground Echelon of the squadron sailed from [[Southampton]] for [[Le Havre]], Upper Normandy, France, with a shipload of mules and horses.  After landing, the squadron was met by a British officer and the Flights were sent off to their various destinations. Headquarters Flight was assigned to [[No. 24 Squadron RAF|24 Squadron]] at [[Matigny]] in the [[Somme (department)|Somme]]; \"A\" Flight to [[No. 84 Squadron RAF|84 Squadron]] at [[Guizancourt]], also in the Somme; \"B\" to [[No. 60 Squadron RAF|60 Squadron]] at Ste. Marie Capelle, near [[Hazebrouck]] on the [[Flanders]] front; and \"C\" to [[No. 56 Squadron RAF|56 Squadron]] at [[Baizieux Airdrome]] in [[Somme (department)|Somme]].  All left at once except \"B\" Flight which followed on the 10th.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nThanks to the training the men received in the United States, the men of the 17th knew their aircraft well enough to be a help rather than a hindrance to the squadrons to which they were attached.  Also, both officers and men realized they were a part of an experiment in training squadrons in the field, and that, with their ability to get on well with the British, the future of this method of training in no small measure depended for the following units coming from the United States.  The 17th was completely detached from the United States [[Army Air Service]]; its flights were totally out of touch with each other.  Occasionally an American officer would come by for an hour or so, at widely scattered intervals, to see how well they were \"getting on\".  Each flight relied on the British for all of its necessary resources, including clothing and transport.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nAs a result of the German [[Spring Offensive]], all of the Flights, with the exception of \"B\", were still at the Airdromes they were assigned originality.  \"B\" Flight had moved to [[Bailleul, Nord|Bailleul Airdrome]] on the Somme, where it and 60 Squadron where it came under shell fire from the advancing German Army, although it suffered no casualties. On 23 March, the Squadron moved to La Bellevue, near [[Arras]], Pas-de-Calais, while the Flight left for Fienvillers, Somme, on 28 March, where the Squadron had arrived the previous day. All of the Flights were now on the front involved in defending the line against the Germans and from the end of March, all Flights took part in a succession of movements carried out in the face of the enemy advance.  The men of the 17th helped build new Airdromes; break them down and build still others as the British Army moved back.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nHeadquarters Flight began moving on the first day of the German Attack (21 March) when 24 Squadron moved from Matigny less than two hours before the Germans reached it, and some squadron members were still burning the quarters and hangars.  While doing so, advance soldiers of the Germans had reached the airfield and they were under machine-gun fire.  From Matigny, the Flight and Squadron moved to [[Bertangles]]; then from Bertangles to [[Conteville, Somme|Conteville]].<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nAt Guizancourt, \"A\" Flight had received enemy artillery fire, and along with 64 Squadron had moved to Champien Aerodrome, near [[Roye, Somme|Roye]]; the last man got away only an hour and a half before the Germans arrived.  From Roye it moved to La ferme du Vert Galand aerodrome on 24 March and then to [[Conteville, Somme|Conteville]], been billeted in Maison-Ponthieu on 29 March.  By the time the front was held, \"A\", without 64 Squadron, only made one more move on 5 April to Bertangles.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nThe other two flights had much the same experience.  \"B\" Flight had come down from Flanders to Bellevue with 60 Squadron just in time to stand by to move.   All the British Squadrons supplies and property were divided up so that, if the need arose, they could be destroyed quickly in the order of their importance.  Nothing, in spite of the danger, was lost.  The Flight and Squadron moved to Fienvillers on 28 March where they remained until 18 April when it moved again to Boffles aerodrome, setting camp at [[Rougefay]].   \"C\" Flight moved only one time on 26 March from [[Baizieux]] to La ferme du Valheureux, near Candas.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nDuring the three months of the German offensive, the RAF experienced the most busiest and dangerous times it had every known, and during this period, the men of the 17th Aero Squadron learned much more than the maintenance of aircraft.  They learned what it meant to send out patrols and move frequently from one airdrome to another at the same time.   The knowledge that it gained in actual experience was more valuable than the knowledge they gained working with the RAF in maintaining aircraft.  This became invaluable when the 17th began operating as an American unit with the RAF and word came in the middle of the night to move in five hours, they were fully capable of the task.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nOn 18 May it was decided that the Americans should be assigned to [[Sopwith Camel]] units.  The mechanics would be given a month to master their overhaul and upkeep.  Headquarters and \"A\" flights were assigned to [[No. 23 Squadron RAF|23 Squadron]], then to [[No. 60 Squadron RAF|60 Squadron]]; \"B\" Flight was assigned to [[No. 46 Squadron RAF|46 Squadron]] and \"C\" Flight to [[No. 3 Squadron RAF|3 squadron]].  The men learned rapidly, and on 20 {{not a typo|June the 17th}} Aero Squadron was re-assembled at [[Petite Synthe Aerodrome]], near [[Dunkirk]], to become a combat squadron and resume its identity as a squadron.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\n===RAF combat operations===\n====Petite Synthe====\nAt Petite Synthe Airdrome the 17th received its official insignia, secret at the time, a white Dumbbell painted on each side of the fuselage aft of the cockpit.  Later, in anticipation of its return to American command, the squadron adopted its own symbol, the \"Great Snow Owl\".  However, it was with the Dumbbell that the squadron engaged in combat. The squadron was assigned to the 65 Wing, Royal Air Force for operations.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/> However, [[No. 19 Squadron RAF]] also used the same basic form of \"dumbbell\" squadron marking, albeit with slightly larger circles at each end, on its own [[Sopwith Dolphin]] fighters from November 1917 onward through the summer of 1918, and is believed to have used them on its Dolphins right up to Armistice Day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rafweb.org/Squadrons/Sqn%20Markings/SqnMark019A.htm |title=Air of Authority \u2013 A History of RAF Organisation \u2013 No 19 Squadron Aircraft & Markings 1916\u20131931 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=9 November 2018 |website=www.rafweb.org |publisher=rafweb.org |access-date=21 April 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Franks |first=Norman |date=2002 |title=Osprey Aircraft of the Aces #48 \u2013 Dolphin and Snipe Aces of World War 1 |location=Oxford, UK |publisher=Osprey Publishing Ltd. |pages=27\u201328, 34\u201336, 62 |isbn=1-84176-317-9 }}</ref>\n\nAfter several weeks of familiarization flights, the 17th Aero Squadron entered combat on 15 July 1918 for the first time.  The front was very quiet.  Lt. Rodney D. Williams brought down its first enemy airplane not far from [[Ostend]], Belgium about 09:45 on 20 July when the squadron encountered a formation of five German Fokker biplanes at approximately 21,000 feet.  Several bursts of machine-gun fire were fired at a rather long range at two different aircraft, and one German aircraft seemed to be hit as a tracer bullet exploded in the fuselage behind the pilot, however the plane went down under control.   Another Fokker dove on Lt. Williams, firing short bursts.  He maneuvered so he was about twenty-five yards to the enemy pilot's left rear and gave him a burst of forty or fifty bullets which appeared to strike the enemy plane at the pilot's seat.  The enemy plane then turned on its back then fell out of the sky apparently out of control.   That same day, the first casualty of the war was suffered by the squadron, when Lt. George Glenn was seen diving deeply south of Ostend after being attacked by a German [[Fokker D.VII]].<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nFrom Petite Snythe Airdrome, the squadron engaged in combat operations almost daily afterwards, frequently engaging German aircraft in aerial battles over the skies of northern France and Belgium.  Missions included escorting RAF bomber squadrons attacking enemy positions in occupied areas.   A major attack on a German airfield in Belgium, at Vessanaere, near [[Bruges]] was carried out with the RAF [[No. 210 Squadron RAF|210]] and [[No. 213 Squadron RAF|213]] bomb squadrons.  The 17th rendezvoused with the squadrons over the English Channel and once assembled, the 17th was to provide cover from enemy aircraft interceptors.   After several postponements, the attack was carried out on 13 August. The 17th took off before dawn and in conjunction with the RAF 5th Group squadrons, the bombers attacked the airfield from a low level, then proceeded to shoot at hangars and huts on the aerodrome. A gasoline dump was set on fire with six Fokker biplanes being set on fire on the ground, with an additional two being hit directly by bombs.   Two hangars sere set on fire and another one severely damaged.   The 17th circled the airdrome and attacked enemy aircraft and ground personnel preparing them to take off.   The 17th claimed seven enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground.   Later, it was confirmed that the raid destroyed a total of fourteen enemy aircraft.  Many of the attacking aircraft were hit by ground fire but all managed to return without loss.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\n====Auxi-le-Chateau====\nOn 18 {{not a typo|August the 17th}} was ordered to move to Auxi-le-Chateau Airdrome.  The word came at 23:00 and the squadron pulled out at dawn.   They arrived the next day, and were settled in enough to send the first combat patrol over the lines on 21 August, shooting down four enemy aircraft.   The [[Chateau Thierry offensive]] was in full swing, with the squadron flying low bombing patrols, attacking gas balloons and infantry with their machine guns.   Each pilot went on two patrols each day from dawn until disk.   On 23 August, Lt. Williams was hit in the back and his petrol tank was pierced by enemy machine gun fire.  Despite his wound, he put his finger in the petrol tank to plug the leak, then was able to land his aircraft successfully.  The squadron over the next few days shot down one enemy gas balloon each day, with the exception of the 23d when they were put on low bombing dive and strafing missions all day.   Attacks on the enemy was largely concentrated in the vicinity of Cambrai, but the congestion on the roads behind his lines presented opportunities for much greater damage to his morale by attacking trucks and troops on the highway from altitudes of less than a few hundred feet.   When flying the low-level attacks, the 17th relied on other squadrons patrolling higher up to look out for the enemy's Fokkers, while the squadron received ground fire from the enemy below.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\n26 August was the squadron's most tragic day.  It had rained during the night and a gusty wind had begun to blow at dawn and was getting stronger and gustier.   Low clouds, with gaps of blue between them moved in from the southwest.    The squadron was called for a patrol about 16:30 with a mission to attack a lot of enemy on the lines and some friendly \"low-straffers\" in trouble on the Bapaume-Cambrai road.    The squadron took off and upon reaching the lines, shot down an enemy balloon, On crossing the line, five Fokkers were seen attacking friendly forces on the line.   Immediately afterwards, a Camel was seen being attacked by the five Fokkers at a height of about 1,000 feet.   The patrol at once went to the assistance of the Camel and attacked the enemy aircraft.   Several other flights of Fokkers were then seen diving from the clouds.   A general engagement took place in which still other flights of Fokkers came down from higher altitudes.  Six 17th pilots were shot down and another only just succeed in getting back to the Auxi Airdrome with a number of Fokkers on his tail and firing continuously.   All of the downed pilots (William Tipton, Robert Todd, Henry Frost, Laurence Roberts, Henry Jackson, and Howard Bittinger) were given up for loss, but about a month later a post card was sent from William Tipton that he, Robert Todd and Henry Frost had survived, along with George Wise who was captured on 24 August. However, Henry Frost had died of his wounds. The post card also confirmed that the patrol had downed three German planes, of which Tipton was credited for two and Todd one.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/><ref>Clapp, Frederick M. History of the 17th Aero Squadron, Garden City, NY: Country Life Press, December 1920</ref>\n\nAfter the losses that day, the RAF kept the squadron out of combat for about a week.   Several new aircraft arrived along with some new pilots being assigned.  While the squadron operated from the Auxi Airdrome, often in conjunction with the 148th Aero Squadron, the line moved east rapidly and it was necessary for the squadron to establish an Advanced Landing Ground at Beugnatre on 10 September from which the squadron took up wireless interception and devoted itself to attacking enemy two-seater observation aircraft.   A detail of mechanics were sent to Beugnatre and several hangars were erected.  Beugnatre was a former British Airdrome that had been captured by the Germans and was severely damaged during its occupation.  The fields were a mess of shell holes, rusty Nissen huts lined the road which were riddled by machine gun holes and had caved in.    The ground mechanics and crew managed to fill in the shell holes and operations by the squadron flew from dusk to dawn until 20 September.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\n====Soncamp====\nWith the line advancing east and north, the squadron was again ordered to move to an airdrome near [[Doullens]] which was being vacated by No. 12 Squadron on 20 September.   The day was cold and rainy with low clouds, however the aircraft took off and the trucks were loaded with stores and other equipment. Soncamp Aerodrome occupied the north side of a farm house, south of the typical French farming village of [[Sombrin]], Pas-de-Calais. The farm buildings were enclosed in a large stone wall, perhaps the relic of a small convent, with a high archway into a farmyard. The hangars were permanent and of camouflaged corrugated iron. There were good huts as barracks for the enlisted men.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nFlight operations begin on the 22d, and on the first morning patrol, fifteen Fokkers were seen diving on the squadron's \"C\" flight, outnumbering them five-to-one.   The 17th's pilots, however, returned their fire and eventually about thirty aircraft were engaged in the aerial battle and downed six enemy aircraft.    A Lt Tillinghast, was shot down in the battle.   He turned up later in [[London]] with a remarkable story of how he was captured by the Germans and taken to a house in the rear of their lines.    Being locked up in a room, he managed to escape though a hole in the roof and made his way from [[Valenciennes]] to [[Belgium]], where he obtained a suit of civilian clothing.   Friendly Belgians moved him from one home to another at night on an underground railway.   Finally he reached [[Brussels]], where he moved freely on the streets.  He even went to the length, it seems, of taking a streetcar ride to a neighboring German Aerodrome that he inspected carefully and at length.  Somewhere in Brussels he became friends with a Belgian engineer who ran the electric plant from which the current for charging the frontier wire barrier was generated.   The engineer let him into all his official secrets and gave him a clippers and wire gloves.   Having set the hour of his crossing over, the engineer gave him final instructions about making good his escape and managed to cross over onto our side of the line.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nAs the army kept moving forward, the line changed from day to day.  The army was battling on the [[Canal du Nord]], the [[Hindenburg Line]], the [[Canal de l'Escaut]] and [[Cambrai]].   The 17th was in combat each and every day during the [[Battle of Cambrai (1918)|battle]] there, carrying out bombing missions and strafing enemy forces on the ground from low-level.  As the [[Battle of Cambrai (1918)|Battle for Cambrai]] progressed, the squadron's patrols would attack large formations of enemy Fokkers by ambushing them in the clouds, or bait them by trying to pull them over friendly territory.  The Germans also did the same to the squadron, as the German pilots were very aggressive and frequently the squadron wound up in air-to-air combat with them.   The enemy were very good pilots and, as the squadron found out later, were one of the most famous of the German organizations and well known for their exploits on other fronts.   On 24 September a formation of fourteen 17th aircraft saw, rather far off, an enemy formation of thirteen.   A short while later two enemy two-seater observation planes were spotted and several of the squadron's aircraft dived down on them.  However, it turned out they were 'bait' as shortly afterwards, a formation of sixteen Fokkers dived down on them without warning, while another flight of enemy aircraft waited for their best moment to pounce on the rest of the squadron.   Four of the 17th's aircraft had their guns jam, however ten others attacked the enemy and shot down five and another was driven out of control with no losses.   Later, the 148th attacked the same flight of Fokkers, or what remained of them and shot down six more enemy aircraft.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nDuring the greater part of October, the squadron brought \"great discomfort\" to the enemy in many ways, and broke up the organization of his retreat towards the German frontier in spite of low clouds and a drizzling rain on many days.  The squadron reported much materiel to British Intelligence which made it possible for ground units to attack in his weakest spots.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\n====Transfer to the AEF====\nOn 25 October, the squadron was again ordered to prepare itself to move.   [[Estourmel]] was selected as an Advanced Landing Ground and Exnes as the site of a new Aerodrome.   However, new orders were received that the squadron was to \"go south\" which meant being transferred to the American sector and joining the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] (AEF).   The news had a mixed reception, as the squadron wanted naturally to join its own forces, however the squadron had been quite happy fighting with the RAF forces and learned their game and how to play it well.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nThe order came to turn in all British supplies and prepare to depart.  This included the squadron's Sopwith Camels, as the squadron would be re-equipped by the AEF.   RAF Major General [[Charles Longcroft]], flew over in his Camel and assembled the entire squadron in a hangar.   He walked the ranks and spoke to many of the men and asked what their work had been in America and what they did as part of the squadron.  He then read to all a letter from General [[Julian Byng]], commander of the [[British Third Army]] expressing to the squadron his sincere appreciation for their excellent and hard work.  The moment was impressive.  Afterwards General Longcroft came to the Officer's mess and thanked each and every pilot and officer for their efforts in behalf of the Royal Air Force.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\nOn 1 November the squadron entrained on the railhead at [[Saulty]], proceeding on the long trip to [[Toul]] in the American Sector.  On its arrival, the 17th Aero Squadron was assigned to the [[4th Pursuit Group]] and was assigned to [[Toul-Croix de Metz Airfield|Croix de Metz Aerodrome]] on the north side of the city.   The AEF assigned French [[SPAD S.XI]] aircraft to the squadron, but before the squadron was fully organized, the armistice with Germany was signed on 11 November and active operations by the squadron ended.<ref name=\"Gorrell\"/>\n\n====Demobilization====\nOn 12 December 1918 orders were received from First Army for the squadron to report to the 1st Air Depot, [[Colombey-les-Belles Airdrome]] to turn in all of its supplies and equipment and was relieved from duty with the AEF. The squadron's SPAD aircraft were delivered to the American Air Service Acceptance Park No. 1 at [[Orly Air Base|Orly Aerodrome]] to be returned to the French.  There practically all of the pilots and observers were detached from the Squadron.<ref name=\"Demob\">Series \"D\", Weekly Statistical Reports of Air Service Activities, October 1918 \u2013 May 1919.

There, personnel awaited scheduling to report to one of the Base Ports in France for transport to the United States.  When the unit arrived back in New York City at the end of March, the 17th Aero Squadron demobilized.<ref name=\"Demob\"/>\n\n===Lineage===\n* Organized as '''29th Provisional Aero Squadron''' on 16 June 1917\n: Redesignated '''17th Aero Squadron''' on 30 July 1917\n: Redesignated '''17th Aero Squadron''' (Pursuit) June 1918\n: Demobilized on 1 April 1919\n* Reconstituted on 17 October 1936 and consolidated with the [[17th Pursuit Squadron]]\n\n===Assignments===\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break|width=50%}}\n* Post Headquarters, Kelly Field, 16 June-4 August 1917\n* Training Section, Air Service, 4 August-12 October 1917\n: Attached to the [[Royal Flying Corps]] for training, entire period\n* Post Headquarters, Camp Taliaferro, Texas, 12 October-23 December 1917\n: Attached to the [[Royal Flying Corps]] for training, entire period\n* Aviation Concentration Center, 23 December 1917 \u2013 9 January 1918\n* Air Service Headquarters, AEF, British Isles\n: Attached to: [[Royal Flying Corps]]/[[Royal Air Force]] for training: 11 February\u2013June 1918 (RAF [[1918 in aviation#April|formed on 1 April]])\n: Attached to: No. 65 Wing, [[Royal Air Force]] for operations, 20 June 1918\n: Attached to: No. 13 Wing, [[Royal Air Force]] for operations, 18 August-30 October 1918\n{{Col-break|width=50%}}\n* [[4th Pursuit Group]], 4\u201311 November 1918\n* 1st Air Depot, AEF, 12 December 1918\n* Commanding General, Services of Supply, 15 January 1919\n* Eastern Department, 20 March 1919\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Stations===\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break|width=50%}}\n* [[Kelly Field]], Texas, 16 June 1917\n* [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada, 4 August 1917\n: Detachment at: [[Deseronto]], Ontario, c 28 August-3 October 1917\n: Detachment at: [[Camp Borden]], Ontario, c 28 August-3 October 1917\n* [[Hicks Field]] (#1), Camp Taliaferro, Texas, 12 October 1917\n{{Col-break|width=50%}}\n* [[Aviation Concentration Center]], Garden City, New York, 23 December 1917 \u2013 9 January 1918\n:: Trans-Atlantic crossing: [[RMS Carmania (1905)|RMS ''Carmania''']]\n* [[Liverpool]], England, 25 January 1918\n* Romsey Rest Camp, [[Winchester]], England, 25 January 1918\n:: Air Echelon attached to RAF for continued combat flight training\n{{col-end}}\n* [[Le Havre]], France, 9 February 1918\n:: Ground Echelon separated into Flights for support training with RFC/RAF\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break|width=25%}}\nHeadquarters Flight\n* Attached to: No. 24 Squadron RAF\n: Matigny Airdrome, France, 9 February 1918\n: Bertangles Airdrome, France, 21 March 1918\n{{Col-break|width=25%}}\n\"A\" Flight\n* Attached to: [[No. 84 Squadron RAF]]\n: Guizencourt Airdrome, France, 9 February 1918\n: Champien Airdrome, France, 21 March 1918\n: Ferme du Vert Galand Airdrome, France, 24 March 1918\n: Conteville Airdrome, France, 29 March 1918\n: Bertangles Airdrome, France, 5 April 1918\n{{Col-break|width=25%}}\n\"B\" Flight\n* Attached to: [[No. 60 Squadron RAF]]\n: Ste.

When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) which provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the blood stream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells acts as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevents deposition of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>  IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers is associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' do develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture. When bacteria do not grow from people strongly suspected of having melioidosis, repeated cultures should be taken as subsequent cultures can become positive.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> ''B. pseudomallei'' can be grown on sheep blood agar, [[MacConkey agar]], [[Ashdown's medium]] (containing [[gentamicin]]),<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> or Ashdown's broth (containing [[colistin]]).<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Agar plates for melioidosis should be incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C (98.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) in air <ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> and inspected daily for four days. On the agar plates, ''B. pseudomallei'' forms creamy, [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|non-haemolytic]], colonies after 2 days of incubation. After 4 days of incubation, colonies appear dry and wrinkled.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Colonies of ''B. pseudomallei'' that are grown on Francis medium (a modification of Ashdown medium with gentamicin concentration increased to 8&nbsp;mg/L) are yellow. For laboratories located outside endemic areas, ''Burkholderia cepacia'' selective agar or ''Pseudomonas'' selective agar can be used if Ashdown's medium is not available.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> It is important not misinterpret the bacterial growth as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp. Other biochemical screening tools can also be used for detecting ''B. pseudomallei'', including the [[analytical profile index|API 20NE or 20E biochemical kit]] combined with Gram stain, [[oxidase test]], typical growth characteristics, and resistance to certain antibiotics of the bacteria.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Molecular methods such as 16S rDNA probes and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can also be used to detect ''B. pseudomallei'' in culture, but they are only available in research and reference laboratories.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nGeneral blood tests in people with melioidosis show low white blood cell counts (indicates infection), raised liver enzymes, increased [[bilirubin]] levels (indicates liver dysfunction), and raised urea and creatinine levels (indicates kidney dysfunction).<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> [[Hypoglycemia|Low blood glucose]] and [[acidosis]] predicts a poorer prognosis in those with melioidosis.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> However, other tests such as [[C-reactive protein]] and [[procalcitonin]] levels are not reliable in predicting the severity of melioidosis infection.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/>\n\nBy microscopy, ''B. pseudomallei'' is seen as [[Gram stain|gram-negative]] and rod-shaped, with a bipolar staining similar in appearance to a safety pin. Bacteria can sometimes be seen directly in clinical samples from infected people; however, identification by light microscopy is neither [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]] nor [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]]. [[Immunofluorescence microscopy]] is highly specific for detecting bacteria directly from clinical specimens, but has less than 50% sensitivity.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> A lateral flow immunoassay has been developed but not extensively evaluated.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> An increasing number of laboratories use [[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to identify the bacteria accurately.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n[[serology|Serological test]]s such as indirect [[haemagglutination assay|haemagglutination]] have been used to detect the presence of antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei''. However, different groups of people have widely different levels of antibodies, so interpretation of these tests depends on location. In Australia, less than 5% of people have ''B. pseudomallei'' antibodies, so the presence of even relatively low amounts of antibody is unusual and could suggest melioidosis. In Thailand, many people have antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei'' so only a relatively high amount of antibody in the blood suggests melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Thailand also uses [[Direct fluorescent antibody|direct immunofluorescent antibody test]] (IFAT) and latex agglutination.  In IFAT, both ''B. pseudomallei'' antigen and ''B. thailandensis'' can be used to quantify the amount of antibodies produced against the bacteria. Therefore, the results have to be interpreted with caution as there could be a false-positive reaction if someone is previously exposed to non-pathogenic ''B. thailandensis''.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> [[Latex agglutination]] is useful in screening for suspected ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> A commercial [[ELISA]] kit for melioidosis appears to perform well.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Limmathurotsakul D, Chantratita N, Teerawattanasook N, et al |title= Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for the Diagnosis of Melioidosis: Better Than We Thought|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|year=2011|volume=52|issue=8|pages=1024&ndash;1028|pmid=21460318|doi=10.1093/cid/cir080|pmc=3070030}}</ref> but no ELISA test has yet been clinically validated as a diagnostic tool.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Peacock SJ, Cheng AC, Currie BJ, Dance DA|title=The Use of Positive Serological Tests as Evidence of Exposure to ''Burkholderia pseudomallei''|journal=American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|year=2011|volume=84|issue=6|pages= 1021&ndash;1022|pmid=21633045|doi=10.4269/ajtmh.2011.11-0114a| pmc=3110358}}</ref>\n\nIt is not possible to diagnose melioidosis on imaging studies alone<ref name=\"Lim2010\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Lim KS, Chong VH |title=Radiological manifestations of melioidosis|journal=Clinical Radiology|year=2010|volume=65|issue=1|pmid=20103424|pages=66&ndash;72|doi=10.1016/j.crad.2009.08.008}}</ref> (such as [[X-rays]], ultrasound, and CT scans),<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/><ref name=\"Lim2010\"/> but imaging is routinely performed to assess the extent of disease spread.<ref name=\"Muttarak2008\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Muttarak M, Peh WC, Euathrongchit J, Lin SE, Tan AG, Lerttumnongtum P, Sivasomboon C |title=Spectrum of imaging findings in melioidosis|journal= British Journal of Radiology|year=2008|pmid=19098086|volume=82|issue=978|pages=514\u2013521|doi=10.1259/bjr/15785231}}</ref> Imaging of the abdomen using CT scans or ultrasound is recommended routinely, as abscesses may not be clinically apparent and may coexist with disease elsewhere.

They subsequently developed melioidosis pneumonia. Involvement of lymph nodes in the [[mediastinum]] can occur in pneumonia caused by melioidosis. Animal studies have also shown that inhalation is associated with a high rate of death.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n==Pathogenesis==\n''B. pseudomallei'' has the ability to infect various types of cells and to evade human immune responses.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Bacteria first enter at a break in the skin or [[mucous membrane]] and replicate in the epithelial cells.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> From there, they use [[flagella]]r motility to spread and infect various cell types. In the blood stream, the bacteria can infect both [[phagocyte]]s and non-phagocytes. ''B. pseudomallei'' use their flagella to move near [[Host (biology)|host]] cells, then attach to the cells using various adhesion proteins, including the [[type IV pilus]] protein PilA as well as adhesion proteins BoaA and BoaB. Additionally, adhesion of the bacteria partially depends on the presence of the host protein [[Coagulation factor II receptor|Protease-activated receptor-1]] which is present on the surface of [[endothelial cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and [[monocyte]]s.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Once bound, the bacteria enter host cells through [[endocytosis]], ending up inside an endocytic [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]. As the vesicle acidifies, ''B. pseudomallei'' uses its [[Bacterial secretion system#Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)|Type 3 secretion system]] (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host [[cytoplasm]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by host [[autophagy]] using various T3SS effector proteins, including BopA.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nInside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of host [[actin]] behind them, propelling the bacteria forward.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the [[Secretion#Type V secretion system .28T5SS.29|autotransporter]] BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of [[multinucleated giant cells]] (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) which provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the blood stream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells acts as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevents deposition of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>  IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers is associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' do develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture. When bacteria do not grow from people strongly suspected of having melioidosis, repeated cultures should be taken as subsequent cultures can become positive.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> ''B. pseudomallei'' can be grown on sheep blood agar, [[MacConkey agar]], [[Ashdown's medium]] (containing [[gentamicin]]),<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> or Ashdown's broth (containing [[colistin]]).<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Agar plates for melioidosis should be incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C (98.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) in air <ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> and inspected daily for four days. On the agar plates, ''B. pseudomallei'' forms creamy, [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|non-haemolytic]], colonies after 2 days of incubation. After 4 days of incubation, colonies appear dry and wrinkled.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Colonies of ''B. pseudomallei'' that are grown on Francis medium (a modification of Ashdown medium with gentamicin concentration increased to 8&nbsp;mg/L) are yellow. For laboratories located outside endemic areas, ''Burkholderia cepacia'' selective agar or ''Pseudomonas'' selective agar can be used if Ashdown's medium is not available.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> It is important not misinterpret the bacterial growth as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp. Other biochemical screening tools can also be used for detecting ''B. pseudomallei'', including the [[analytical profile index|API 20NE or 20E biochemical kit]] combined with Gram stain, [[oxidase test]], typical growth characteristics, and resistance to certain antibiotics of the bacteria.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Molecular methods such as 16S rDNA probes and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can also be used to detect ''B. pseudomallei'' in culture, but they are only available in research and reference laboratories.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nGeneral blood tests in people with melioidosis show low white blood cell counts (indicates infection), raised liver enzymes, increased [[bilirubin]] levels (indicates liver dysfunction), and raised urea and creatinine levels (indicates kidney dysfunction).<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> [[Hypoglycemia|Low blood glucose]] and [[acidosis]] predicts a poorer prognosis in those with melioidosis.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> However, other tests such as [[C-reactive protein]] and [[procalcitonin]] levels are not reliable in predicting the severity of melioidosis infection.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/>\n\nBy microscopy, ''B. pseudomallei'' is seen as [[Gram stain|gram-negative]] and rod-shaped, with a bipolar staining similar in appearance to a safety pin. Bacteria can sometimes be seen directly in clinical samples from infected people; however, identification by light microscopy is neither [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]] nor [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]]. [[Immunofluorescence microscopy]] is highly specific for detecting bacteria directly from clinical specimens, but has less than 50% sensitivity.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> A lateral flow immunoassay has been developed but not extensively evaluated.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> An increasing number of laboratories use [[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to identify the bacteria accurately.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n[[serology|Serological test]]s such as indirect [[haemagglutination assay|haemagglutination]] have been used to detect the presence of antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei''. However, different groups of people have widely different levels of antibodies, so interpretation of these tests depends on location. In Australia, less than 5% of people have ''B. pseudomallei'' antibodies, so the presence of even relatively low amounts of antibody is unusual and could suggest melioidosis. In Thailand, many people have antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei'' so only a relatively high amount of antibody in the blood suggests melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Thailand also uses [[Direct fluorescent antibody|direct immunofluorescent antibody test]] (IFAT) and latex agglutination.  In IFAT, both ''B. pseudomallei'' antigen and ''B. thailandensis'' can be used to quantify the amount of antibodies produced against the bacteria. Therefore, the results have to be interpreted with caution as there could be a false-positive reaction if someone is previously exposed to non-pathogenic ''B. thailandensis''.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> [[Latex agglutination]] is useful in screening for suspected ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> A commercial [[ELISA]] kit for melioidosis appears to perform well.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Limmathurotsakul D, Chantratita N, Teerawattanasook N, et al |title= Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for the Diagnosis of Melioidosis: Better Than We Thought|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|year=2011|volume=52|issue=8|pages=1024&ndash;1028|pmid=21460318|doi=10.1093/cid/cir080|pmc=3070030}}</ref> but no ELISA test has yet been clinically validated as a diagnostic tool.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Peacock SJ, Cheng AC, Currie BJ, Dance DA|title=The Use of Positive Serological Tests as Evidence of Exposure to ''Burkholderia pseudomallei''|journal=American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|year=2011|volume=84|issue=6|pages= 1021&ndash;1022|pmid=21633045|doi=10.4269/ajtmh.2011.11-0114a| pmc=3110358}}</ref>\n\nIt is not possible to diagnose melioidosis on imaging studies alone<ref name=\"Lim2010\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Lim KS, Chong VH |title=Radiological manifestations of melioidosis|journal=Clinical Radiology|year=2010|volume=65|issue=1|pmid=20103424|pages=66&ndash;72|doi=10.1016/j.crad.2009.08.008}}</ref> (such as [[X-rays]], ultrasound, and CT scans),<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/><ref name=\"Lim2010\"/> but imaging is routinely performed to assess the extent of disease spread.<ref name=\"Muttarak2008\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Muttarak M, Peh WC, Euathrongchit J, Lin SE, Tan AG, Lerttumnongtum P, Sivasomboon C |title=Spectrum of imaging findings in melioidosis|journal= British Journal of Radiology|year=2008|pmid=19098086|volume=82|issue=978|pages=514\u2013521|doi=10.1259/bjr/15785231}}</ref> Imaging of the abdomen using CT scans or ultrasound is recommended routinely, as abscesses may not be clinically apparent and may coexist with disease elsewhere.

Then, hospital admission is needed for intravenous antibiotics. For those who have completed treatment successfully, recurrence can also occur due to recrudescence or new melioidosis infection. With better therapies, the recrudescence rate has reduced from 10% to 5%. New infection is now more common than recrudescence.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Risk factors of recrudescence include severity of disease (patients with positive blood cultures or multifocal disease have a higher risk of relapse), choice of antibiotic for eradication therapy (doxycycline monotherapy and fluoroquinolone therapy are not as effective), poor compliance with eradication therapy and duration of eradication therapy less than 8 weeks.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Direk2006\"/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chaowagul W, Suputtamongkol Y, Dance DA, Rajchanuvong A, Pattara-arechachai J, White NJ | year=1993 | title=Relapse in melioidosis: incidence and risk factors | journal=Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume=168 | pages=1181&ndash;1185 | pmid=8228352 | issue=5 | doi=10.1093/infdis/168.5.1181}}</ref>\n\nUnderlying medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and cancer can worsen the long-term survival and disability of those who recover from infection.

Clockwise from top left, they are solid, liquid, plasma, and gas, represented by an [[ice sculpture]], a [[Drop (liquid)|drop]] of water, [[electrical arc]]ing from a [[tesla coil]], and the air around clouds, respectively.]]\nIn [[physics]], a '''state of matter''' is one of the distinct forms in which [[matter]] can exist. Four states of matter are observable in everyday life: [[solid]], [[liquid]], [[gas]], and [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. Many intermediate states are known to exist, such as [[liquid crystal]], and some states only exist under extreme conditions, such as [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]]s, [[neutron-degenerate matter]], and [[quark\u2013gluon plasma]], which only occur, respectively, in situations of extreme cold, extreme density, and extremely high energy. For a complete list of all exotic states of matter, see the [[list of states of matter]].\n\nHistorically, the distinction is made based on qualitative differences in properties. Matter in the solid state maintains a fixed volume and shape, with component particles ([[atoms]], [[molecules]] or [[ions]]) close together and fixed into place. Matter in the liquid state maintains a fixed volume, but has a variable shape that adapts to fit its container. Its particles are still close together but move freely. Matter in the gaseous state has both variable volume and shape, adapting both to fit its container. Its particles are neither close together nor fixed in place. Matter in the plasma state has variable volume and shape, and contains neutral atoms as well as a significant number of ions and electrons, both of which can move around freely.\n\nThe term [[Phase (matter)|phase]] is sometimes used as a synonym for state of matter, but a system can contain several [[Miscibility|immiscible]] phases of the same state of matter.\n\n== The four fundamental states ==\n\n===Solid===\n\n[[File:Stohrem.jpg|thumb|right|A crystalline solid: atomic resolution image of [[strontium titanate]]. Brighter atoms are [[strontium]] and darker ones are [[titanium]].]]\n\n{{Main|Solid}}\n\nIn a solid, constituent particles (ions, atoms, or molecules) are closely packed together. The [[Bonding in solids|forces between particles]] are so strong that the particles cannot move freely but can only vibrate. As a result, a solid has a stable, definite shape, and a definite volume. Solids can only change their shape by an outside force, as when broken or cut.\n\nIn [[crystal|crystalline solids]], the particles (atoms, molecules, or ions) are packed in a regularly ordered, repeating pattern. There are various different [[crystal structure]]s, and the same substance can have more than one structure (or solid phase). For example, [[iron]] has a [[cubic crystal system|body-centred cubic]] structure at temperatures below {{convert|912|C|F}}, and a [[cubic crystal system|face-centred cubic]] structure between 912 and {{convert|1394|C|F}}. [[Ice]] has fifteen known crystal structures, or fifteen solid phases, which exist at various temperatures and pressures.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n |author=M.A. Wahab\n |date=2005\n |title=Solid State Physics: Structure and Properties of Materials\n |publisher=Alpha Science\n |pages=1\u20133\n |isbn=978-1-84265-218-3\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Glass]]es and other non-crystalline, [[amorphous solid]]s without [[order and disorder (physics)|long-range order]] are not [[thermal equilibrium]] ground states; therefore they are described below as nonclassical states of matter.\n\nSolids can be transformed into liquids by melting, and liquids can be transformed into solids by freezing. Solids can also change directly into gases through the process of [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]], and gases can likewise change directly into solids through [[deposition (phase transition)|deposition]].\n\n===Liquid===\n[[Image:Teilchenmodell Fl\u00fcssigkeit.svg|thumb|Structure of a classical monatomic liquid. Atoms have many nearest neighbors in contact, yet no long-range order is present.]]\n{{Main|Liquid}}\nA liquid is a nearly incompressible [[fluid]] that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure. The volume is definite if the [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] are constant. When a solid is heated above its [[melting point]], it becomes liquid, given that the pressure is higher than the [[triple point]] of the substance. Intermolecular (or interatomic or interionic) forces are still important, but the molecules have enough energy to move relative to each other and the structure is mobile. This means that the shape of a liquid is not definite but is determined by its container. The volume is usually greater than that of the corresponding solid, the best known exception being [[water]], H{{sub|2}}O. The highest temperature at which a given liquid can exist is its [[critical temperature]].<ref name=White>\n{{Cite book\n |author=F.

Gas molecules have very weak or no bonds at all. The molecules in \"gas\" can move freely and fast.]]\n\n{{Main|Gas}}\nA gas is a compressible fluid. Not only will a gas conform to the shape of its container but it will also expand to fill the container.\n\nIn a gas, the molecules have enough [[kinetic energy]] so that the effect of intermolecular forces is small (or zero for an [[ideal gas]]), and the typical distance between neighboring molecules is much greater than the molecular size. A gas has no definite shape or volume, but occupies the entire container in which it is confined. A liquid may be converted to a gas by heating at constant pressure to the [[boiling point]], or else by reducing the pressure at constant temperature.\n\nAt temperatures below its [[critical temperature]], a gas is also called a [[vapor]], and can be liquefied by compression alone without cooling. A vapor can exist in equilibrium with a liquid (or solid), in which case the gas pressure equals the [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid (or solid).\n\nA [[supercritical fluid]] (SCF) is a gas whose temperature and pressure are above the critical temperature and [[critical temperature|critical pressure]] respectively. In this state, the distinction between liquid and gas disappears. A supercritical fluid has the physical properties of a gas, but its high density confers solvent properties in some cases, which leads to useful applications. For example, [[supercritical carbon dioxide]] is used to [[supercritical fluid extraction|extract]] [[caffeine]] in the manufacture of [[decaffeination|decaffeinated]] coffee.<ref name=Turrell>\n{{Cite book\n |author=G.

This gives it the ability to conduct electricity.]]\n\n{{Main|Plasma (physics)}}\nLike a gas, plasma does not have definite shape or volume. Unlike gases, plasmas are electrically conductive, produce magnetic fields and electric currents, and respond strongly to electromagnetic forces. Positively charged nuclei swim in a \"sea\" of freely-moving disassociated electrons, similar to the way such charges exist in conductive metal, where this electron \"sea\"  allows matter in the plasma state to conduct electricity.\n\nA gas is usually converted to a plasma in one of two ways, e.g., either from a huge voltage difference between two points, or by exposing it to extremely high temperatures. Heating matter to high temperatures causes electrons to leave the atoms, resulting in the presence of free electrons. This creates a so-called partially ionised plasma. At very high temperatures, such as those present in stars, it is assumed that essentially all electrons are \"free\", and that a very high-energy plasma is essentially bare nuclei swimming in a sea of electrons. This forms the so-called fully ionised plasma.\n\nThe plasma state is often misunderstood, and although not freely existing under normal conditions on Earth, it is quite commonly generated by either [[lightning]], [[electric spark]]s, [[Fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lights]], [[Neon sign|neon lights]] or in [[Plasma display|plasma televisions]]. The [[solar corona|Sun's corona]], some types of [[flame]], and stars are all examples of illuminated matter in the plasma state.\n\n==Phase transitions==\n\n{{Main|Phase transitions}}\n\n{{wide image|Physics matter state transition 1 en.svg|800px|This diagram illustrates transitions between the four fundamental states of matter.}}\n\nA state of matter is also characterized by [[phase transitions]]. A phase transition indicates a change in structure and can be recognized by an abrupt change in properties. A distinct state of matter can be defined as any set of [[thermodynamic state|states]] distinguished from any other set of states by a [[phase transition]]. Water can be said to have several distinct solid states.<ref>\n{{Cite web\n |author      = M.

Likewise, [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] states are demarcated by phase transitions and have distinctive properties.\nWhen the change of state occurs in stages the intermediate steps are called [[mesophase]]s. Such phases have been exploited by the introduction of [[liquid crystal]] technology.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n |author=D.L.

Near [[absolute zero]], a substance exists as a [[solid]]. As heat is added to this substance it melts into a liquid at its [[melting point]], boils into a gas at its [[boiling point]], and if heated high enough would enter a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] state in which the [[electrons]] are so energized that they leave their parent atoms.\n\nForms of matter that are not composed of molecules and are organized by different forces can also be considered different states of matter. [[Superfluids]] (like [[Fermionic condensate]]) and the [[quark\u2013gluon plasma]] are examples.\n\nIn a chemical equation, the state of matter of the chemicals may be shown as (s) for solid, (l) for liquid, and (g) for gas. An [[aqueous solution]] is denoted (aq). Matter in the plasma state is seldom used (if at all) in chemical equations, so there is no standard symbol to denote it. In the rare equations that plasma is used in plasma is symbolized as (p).\n\n==Non-classical states==\n\n=== Glass ===\n{{Main|Glass}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | image1    = Silica.svg\n | alt1      = Atoms of Si and O; each atom has the same number of bonds, but the overall arrangement of the atoms is random.\n | width1    = 200\n | image2    = SiO\u00b2 Quartz.svg\n | alt2      = Regular hexagonal pattern of Si and O atoms, with a Si atom at each corner and the O atoms at the centre of each side.\n | width2    = 200\n | footer    = Schematic representation of a random-network glassy form (left) and ordered crystalline lattice (right) of identical chemical composition.\n}}\n\n[[Glass]] is a non-crystalline or [[amorphous solid]] material that exhibits a [[glass transition]] when heated towards the liquid state. Glasses can be made of quite different classes of materials: inorganic networks (such as window glass, made of [[silicate]] plus additives), metallic alloys, ionic melts, aqueous solutions, molecular liquids, and polymers.\nThermodynamically, a glass is in a [[metastable state]] with respect to its crystalline counterpart. The conversion rate, however, is practically zero.\n\n=== Crystals with some degree of disorder ===\n\nA [[plastic crystal]] is a molecular solid with long-range positional order but with constituent molecules retaining rotational freedom; in an [[orientational glass]] this degree of freedom is frozen in a [[order and disorder (physics)|quenched disordered]] state.\n\nSimilarly, in a [[spin glass]] magnetic disorder is frozen.\n\n===Liquid crystal states===\n{{Main|Liquid crystal}}\n\nLiquid crystal states have properties intermediate between mobile liquids and ordered solids. Generally, they are able to flow like a liquid, but exhibiting long-range order. For example, the [[Liquid crystal#Nematic phase|nematic phase]] consists of long rod-like molecules such as [[para-azoxyanisole]], which is nematic in the temperature range {{convert|118\u2013136|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Phase Transitions of Liquid Crystal PAA in Confined Geometries|author=Shao, Y.|author2=Zerda, T.W.|journal=Journal of Physical Chemistry B|date=1998|volume=102|issue=18|pages=3387\u20133394|doi=10.1021/jp9734437}}</ref> In this state the molecules flow as in a liquid, but they all point in the same direction (within each domain) and cannot rotate freely. Like a crystalline solid, but unlike a liquid, liquid crystals react to polarized light.\n\nOther types of liquid crystals are described in the main article on these states. Several types have technological importance, for example, in [[liquid crystal display]]s.\n\n===Magnetically ordered===\n[[Transition metal]] atoms often have [[magnetic moment]]s due to the net [[spin (physics)|spin]] of electrons that remain unpaired and do not form chemical bonds. In some solids the magnetic moments on different atoms are ordered and can form a ferromagnet, an antiferromagnet or a ferrimagnet.\n\nIn a [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnet]]\u2014for instance, solid [[iron]]\u2014the magnetic moment on each atom is aligned in the same direction (within a [[magnetic domain]]). If the domains are also aligned, the solid is a permanent [[magnet]], which is magnetic even in the absence of an external [[magnetic field]]. The [[magnetization]] disappears when the magnet is heated to the [[Curie point]], which for iron is {{convert|768|C|F}}.\n\nAn [[antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnet]] has two networks of equal and opposite magnetic moments, which cancel each other out so that the net magnetization is zero. For example, in [[nickel(II) oxide]] (NiO), half the nickel atoms have moments aligned in one direction and half in the opposite direction.\n\nIn a [[ferrimagnetism|ferrimagnet]], the two networks of magnetic moments are opposite but unequal, so that cancellation is incomplete and there is a non-zero net magnetization. An example is [[magnetite]] (Fe{{sub|3}}O{{sub|4}}), which contains Fe{{sup|2+}} and Fe{{sup|3+}} ions with different magnetic moments.\n\nA [[quantum spin liquid]] (QSL) is a disordered state in a system of interacting quantum spins which preserves its disorder to very low temperatures, unlike other disordered states. It is not a liquid in physical sense, but a solid whose magnetic order is inherently disordered. The name \"liquid\" is due to an analogy with the molecular disorder in a conventional liquid. A QSL is neither a [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnet]], where magnetic domains are parallel, nor an [[Antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnet]], where the magnetic domains are antiparallel; instead, the magnetic domains are randomly oriented. This can be realized e.g. by [[Geometrical frustration|geometrically frustrated]] magnetic moments that cannot point uniformly parallel or antiparallel. When cooling down and settling to a state, the domain must \"choose\" an orientation, but if the possible states are similar in energy, one will be chosen randomly. Consequently, despite strong short-range order, there is no long-range magnetic order.\n\n===Microphase-separated===\n{{Main|Copolymer}}\n\n[[File:Sbs block copolymer.jpg|thumb|right|SBS block copolymer in [[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]]]] [[Copolymers]] can undergo microphase separation to form a diverse array of periodic nanostructures, as shown in the example of the [[Kraton (polymer)|styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer]] shown at right. Microphase separation can be understood by analogy to the phase separation between [[oil]] and water. Due to chemical incompatibility between the blocks, block copolymers undergo a similar phase separation. However, because the blocks are [[covalent bond|covalently bonded]] to each other, they cannot demix macroscopically as water and oil can, and so instead the blocks form [[nanometer]]-sized structures. Depending on the relative lengths of each block and the overall block topology of the polymer, many morphologies can be obtained, each its own phase of matter.\n\n[[Ionic liquid]]s also display microphase separation. The anion and cation are not necessarily compatible and would demix otherwise, but electric charge attraction prevents them from separating. Their anions and cations appear to diffuse within compartmentalized layers or micelles instead of freely as in a uniform liquid.<ref>\u00c1lvarez, V.H.; Dosil, N.; Gonzalez-Cabaleiro, R.; Mattedi, S.; Martin-Pastor, M.; Iglesias, M. & Navaza, J.M.: Br\u00f8nsted Ionic Liquids for Sustainable Processes: Synthesis and Physical Properties.

In a BEC, matter stops behaving as independent particles, and collapses into a single quantum state that can be described with a single, uniform wavefunction.\n\nIn the gas phase, the Bose\u2013Einstein condensate remained an unverified theoretical prediction for many years. In 1995, the research groups of [[Eric Cornell]] and [[Carl Wieman]], of [[JILA]] at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], produced the first such condensate experimentally. A Bose\u2013Einstein condensate is \"colder\" than a solid. It may occur when atoms have very similar (or the same) [[Energy level|quantum levels]], at temperatures very close to [[absolute zero]], {{convert|\u2212273.15|C|F}}.\n\n===Fermionic condensate===\n{{main|Fermionic condensate}}\nA ''fermionic condensate'' is similar to the Bose\u2013Einstein condensate but composed of [[fermion]]s. The [[Pauli exclusion principle]] prevents fermions from entering the same quantum state, but a pair of fermions can behave as a boson, and multiple such pairs can then enter the same quantum state without restriction.\n\n===Rydberg molecule===\nOne of the [[metastable state]]s of strongly non-ideal plasma is [[Rydberg matter]], which forms upon condensation of [[excited state|excited atoms]]. These atoms can also turn into [[ion]]s and [[electron]]s if they reach a certain temperature.

This is a derivation of the Quantum Hall state of matter.\n\n===Photonic matter===\n{{main|Photonic matter}}\nPhotonic matter is a phenomenon where [[photon]]s interacting with a gas develop apparent mass, and can interact with each other, even forming photonic \"molecules\". The source of mass is the gas, which is massive. This is in contrast to photons moving in empty space, which have no [[rest mass]], and cannot interact.\n\n===Dropleton===\n{{main|Dropleton}}\nA \"quantum fog\" of electrons and holes that flow around each other and even ripple like a liquid, rather than existing as discrete pairs.<ref name=\"Luntz\">{{cite web|last1=Luntz|first1=Stephen|title=New State of Matter Discovered|url=http://www.iflscience.com/physics/new-state-matter-discovered/#3Oe9x65kkHViXABt.99|website=IFLScience|accessdate=16 April 2017|language=en|date=3 January 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416224429/http://www.iflscience.com/physics/new-state-matter-discovered/#3Oe9x65kkHViXABt.99|archivedate=16 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==High-energy states==\n\n===Degenerate matter===\n{{Main|Degenerate matter}}\nUnder extremely high pressure, as in the cores of dead stars, ordinary matter undergoes a transition to a series of exotic states of matter collectively known as [[degenerate matter]], which are supported mainly by quantum mechanical effects. In physics, \"degenerate\" refers to two states that have the same energy and are thus interchangeable. Degenerate matter is supported by the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which prevents two [[fermion]]ic particles from occupying the same quantum state. Unlike regular plasma, degenerate plasma expands little when heated, because there are simply no momentum states left. Consequently, degenerate stars collapse into very high densities. More massive degenerate stars are smaller, because the gravitational force increases, but pressure does not increase proportionally.\n\n[[Degenerate matter|Electron-degenerate matter]] is found inside [[white dwarf]] stars. Electrons remain bound to atoms but are able to transfer to adjacent atoms. [[Degenerate matter|Neutron-degenerate matter]] is found in [[neutron star]]s. Vast gravitational pressure compresses atoms so strongly that the electrons are forced to combine with protons via inverse beta-decay, resulting in a superdense conglomeration of neutrons. Normally [[Neutron|free neutrons]] outside an atomic nucleus will [[Radioactive decay|decay]] with a half life of just under 15 minutes, but in a neutron star, the decay is overtaken by inverse decay. Cold degenerate matter is also present in planets such as [[Jupiter]] and in the even more massive [[brown dwarf]]s, which are expected to have a core with [[metallic hydrogen]]. Because of the degeneracy, more massive brown dwarfs are not significantly larger. In metals, the electrons can be modeled as a degenerate gas moving in a lattice of non-degenerate positive ions.\n\n===Quark matter===\n{{Main|QCD matter}}\nIn regular cold matter, [[quark]]s, fundamental particles of nuclear matter, are confined by the [[strong force]] into [[hadron]]s that consist of 2\u20134 quarks, such as protons and neutrons. Quark matter or quantum chromodynanamical (QCD) matter is a group of phases where the strong force is overcome and quarks are deconfined and free to move. Quark matter phases occur at extremely high densities or temperatures, and there are no known ways to produce them in equilibrium in the laboratory; in ordinary conditions, any quark matter formed immediately undergoes radioactive decay.\n\n[[Strange matter]] is a type of [[quark matter]] that is suspected to exist inside some neutron stars close to the [[Tolman\u2013Oppenheimer\u2013Volkoff limit]] (approximately 2\u20133 [[solar mass]]es), although there is no direct evidence of its existence. In strange matter, part of the energy available manifests as [[strange quark]]s, a heavier analogue of the common [[down quark]]. It may be stable at lower energy states once formed, although this is not known.\n\n[[Quark\u2013gluon plasma]] is a very high-temperature phase in which [[quark]]s become free and able to move independently, rather than being perpetually bound into particles, in a sea of [[gluon]]s, subatomic particles that transmit the [[strong interaction|strong force]] that binds quarks together. This is analogous to the liberation of electrons from atoms in a plasma. This state is briefly attainable in extremely high-energy heavy ion collisions in [[particle accelerator]]s, and allows scientists to observe the properties of individual quarks, and not just theorize. Quark\u2013gluon plasma was discovered at [[CERN]] in 2000. Unlike plasma, which flows like a gas, interactions within QGP are strong and it flows like a liquid.\n\nAt high densities but relatively low temperatures, quarks are theorized to form a quark liquid whose nature is presently unknown. It forms a distinct [[Color\u2013flavor locking|color-flavor locked]] (CFL) phase at even higher densities. This phase is [[superconductive]] for color charge. These phases may occur in [[neutron star]]s but they are presently theoretical.\n\n===Color-glass condensate===\n{{Main|Color-glass condensate}}\nColor-glass condensate is a type of matter theorized to exist in atomic nuclei traveling near the speed of light. According to Einstein's theory of relativity, a high-energy nucleus appears length contracted, or compressed, along its direction of motion. As a result, the gluons inside the nucleus appear to a stationary observer as a \"gluonic wall\" traveling near the speed of light. At very high energies, the density of the gluons in this wall is seen to increase greatly. Unlike the quark\u2013gluon plasma produced in the collision of such walls, the color-glass condensate describes the walls themselves, and is an intrinsic property of the particles that can only be observed under high-energy conditions such as those at RHIC and possibly at the Large Hadron Collider as well.\n\n==Very high energy states==\nVarious theories predict new states of matter at very high energies. An unknown state has created the [[baryon asymmetry]] in the universe, but little is known about it. In [[string theory]], a [[Hagedorn temperature]] is predicted for superstrings at about 10<sup>30</sup> K, where superstrings are copiously produced. At [[Planck temperature]] (10<sup>32</sup> K), gravity becomes a significant force between individual particles. No current theory can describe these states and they cannot be produced with any foreseeable experiment. However, these states are important in [[cosmology]] because the universe may have passed through these states in the [[Big Bang]].\n\nThe '''[[gravitational singularity]]''' predicted by [[general relativity]] to exist at the center of a [[black hole]] is ''not'' a phase of matter; it is not a material object at all (although the mass-energy of matter contributed to its creation) but rather a property of [[spacetime]] at a location. It could be argued, of course, that all particles are properties of spacetime at a location,<ref>{{cite book|author1=David Chalmers|author2=David Manley|author3=Ryan Wasserman|title=Metametaphysics: New Essays on the Foundations of Ontology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6nqzIi16CY0C&pg=PA378|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-954604-6|pages=378\u2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917070144/http://books.google.com/books?id=6nqzIi16CY0C&pg=PA378|archivedate=17 September 2014}}</ref> leaving a half-note of controversy on the subject.\n\n==Other proposed states==\n\n===Supersolid===\n{{Main|Supersolid}}\nA supersolid is a spatially ordered material (that is, a solid or crystal) with superfluid properties.

But in a string-net liquid, atoms are arranged in some pattern that requires some electrons to have neighbors with the same spin. This gives rise to curious properties, as well as supporting some unusual proposals about the fundamental conditions of the universe itself.\n\n===Superglass===\n{{Main|Superglass}}\nA superglass is a phase of matter characterized, at the same time, by [[superfluid]]ity and a frozen amorphous structure.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Hidden states of matter]]\n* [[Classical element]]\n* [[Condensed matter physics]]\n* [[Cooling curve]]\n* [[Phase (matter)]]\n* [[Supercooling]]\n* [[Superheating]]\n{{Table_of_phase_transitions}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|States of aggregation}}\n* [http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2005/matter.html 2005-06-22, MIT News: MIT physicists create new form of matter] Citat: \"...&nbsp;They have become the first to create a new type of matter, a gas of atoms that shows high-temperature superfluidity.\"\n* [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/10/031010075634.htm 2003-10-10, Science Daily: Metallic Phase For Bosons Implies New State Of Matter]\n* [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/01/040115074553.htm 2004-01-15, ScienceDaily: Probable Discovery Of A New, Supersolid, Phase Of Matter] Citat: \"...We apparently have observed, for the first time, a solid material with the characteristics of a superfluid...but because all its particles are in the identical quantum state, it remains a solid even though its component particles are continually flowing...\"\n* [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/01/040129073547.htm 2004-01-29, ScienceDaily: NIST/University Of Colorado Scientists Create New Form Of Matter: A Fermionic Condensate]\n* [http://vega.org.uk/video/subseries/30 Short videos demonstrating of States of Matter, solids, liquids and gases by Prof. J M Murrell, University of Sussex]\n\n{{State of matter|state=expanded}}\n{{Condensed matter physics topics}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:State Of Matter}}\n[[Category:Condensed matter physics]]\n[[Category:Engineering thermodynamics]]\n[[Category:Phases of matter| ]]\n[[Category:Physics-related lists|States of matter]]\n", "text_old": "{{Distinguish|Phase (matter)}}\n{{pp|small=yes}}\n{{short description|Distinct forms that different phases of matter take on}}\n[[File:Four Fundamental States of Matter.png|thumb|right|370px|The four common states of matter. Clockwise from top left, they are solid, liquid, plasma, and gas, represented by an [[ice sculpture]], a [[Drop (liquid)|drop]] of water, [[electrical arc]]ing from a [[tesla coil]], and the air around clouds, respectively.]]\nIn [[physics]], a '''state of matter''' is one of the distinct forms in which [[matter]] can exist. Four states of matter are observable in everyday life: [[solid]], [[liquid]], [[gas]], and [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. Many intermediate states are known to exist, such as [[liquid crystal]], and some states only exist under extreme conditions, such as [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]]s, [[neutron-degenerate matter]], and [[quark\u2013gluon plasma]], which only occur, respectively, in situations of extreme cold, extreme density, and extremely high energy. For a complete list of all exotic states of matter, see the [[list of states of matter]].\n\nHistorically, the distinction is made based on qualitative differences in properties. Matter in the solid state maintains a fixed volume and shape, with component particles ([[atoms]], [[molecules]] or [[ions]]) close together and fixed into place. Matter in the liquid state maintains a fixed volume, but has a variable shape that adapts to fit its container. Its particles are still close together but move freely. Matter in the gaseous state has both variable volume and shape, adapting both to fit its container. Its particles are neither close together nor fixed in place. Matter in the plasma state has variable volume and shape, and contains neutral atoms as well as a significant number of ions and electrons, both of which can move around freely.\n\nThe term [[Phase (matter)|phase]] is sometimes used as a synonym for state of matter, but a system can contain several [[Miscibility|immiscible]] phases of the same state of matter.\n\n== The four fundamental states ==\n\n===Solid===\n\n[[File:Stohrem.jpg|thumb|right|A crystalline solid: atomic resolution image of [[strontium titanate]]. Brighter atoms are [[strontium]] and darker ones are [[titanium]].]]\n\n{{Main|Solid}}\n\nIn a solid, constituent particles (ions, atoms, or molecules) are closely packed together. The [[Bonding in solids|forces between particles]] are so strong that the particles cannot move freely but can only vibrate. As a result, a solid has a stable, definite shape, and a definite volume. Solids can only change their shape by an outside force, as when broken or cut.\n\nIn [[crystal|crystalline solids]], the particles (atoms, molecules, or ions) are packed in a regularly ordered, repeating pattern. There are various different [[crystal structure]]s, and the same substance can have more than one structure (or solid phase). For example, [[iron]] has a [[cubic crystal system|body-centred cubic]] structure at temperatures below {{convert|912|C|F}}, and a [[cubic crystal system|face-centred cubic]] structure between 912 and {{convert|1394|C|F}}. [[Ice]] has fifteen known crystal structures, or fifteen solid phases, which exist at various temperatures and pressures.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n |author=M.A. Wahab\n |date=2005\n |title=Solid State Physics: Structure and Properties of Materials\n |publisher=Alpha Science\n |pages=1\u20133\n |isbn=978-1-84265-218-3\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Glass]]es and other non-crystalline, [[amorphous solid]]s without [[order and disorder (physics)|long-range order]] are not [[thermal equilibrium]] ground states; therefore they are described below as nonclassical states of matter.\n\nSolids can be transformed into liquids by melting, and liquids can be transformed into solids by freezing. Solids can also change directly into gases through the process of [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]], and gases can likewise change directly into solids through [[deposition (phase transition)|deposition]].\n\n===Liquid===\n[[Image:Teilchenmodell Fl\u00fcssigkeit.svg|thumb|Structure of a classical monatomic liquid. Atoms have many nearest neighbors in contact, yet no long-range order is present.]]\n{{Main|Liquid}}\nA liquid is a nearly incompressible [[fluid]] that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure. The volume is definite if the [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] are constant. When a solid is heated above its [[melting point]], it becomes liquid, given that the pressure is higher than the [[triple point]] of the substance. Intermolecular (or interatomic or interionic) forces are still important, but the molecules have enough energy to move relative to each other and the structure is mobile. This means that the shape of a liquid is not definite but is determined by its container. The volume is usually greater than that of the corresponding solid, the best known exception being [[water]], H{{sub|2}}O. The highest temperature at which a given liquid can exist is its [[critical temperature]].<ref name=White>\n{{Cite book\n |author=F.

Gas molecules have very weak or no bonds at all. The molecules in \"gas\" can move freely and fast.]]\n\n{{Main|Gas}}\nA gas is a compressible fluid. Not only will a gas conform to the shape of its container but it will also expand to fill the container.\n\nIn a gas, the molecules have enough [[kinetic energy]] so that the effect of intermolecular forces is small (or zero for an [[ideal gas]]), and the typical distance between neighboring molecules is much greater than the molecular size. A gas has no definite shape or volume, but occupies the entire container in which it is confined. A liquid may be converted to a gas by heating at constant pressure to the [[boiling point]], or else by reducing the pressure at constant temperature.\n\nAt temperatures below its [[critical temperature]], a gas is also called a [[vapor]], and can be liquefied by compression alone without cooling. A vapor can exist in equilibrium with a liquid (or solid), in which case the gas pressure equals the [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid (or solid).\n\nA [[supercritical fluid]] (SCF) is a gas whose temperature and pressure are above the critical temperature and [[critical temperature|critical pressure]] respectively. In this state, the distinction between liquid and gas disappears. A supercritical fluid has the physical properties of a gas, but its high density confers solvent properties in some cases, which leads to useful applications. For example, [[supercritical carbon dioxide]] is used to [[supercritical fluid extraction|extract]] [[caffeine]] in the manufacture of [[decaffeination|decaffeinated]] coffee.<ref name=Turrell>\n{{Cite book\n |author=G.

This gives it the ability to conduct electricity.]]\n\n{{Main|Plasma (physics)}}\nLike a gas, plasma does not have definite shape or volume. Unlike gases, plasmas are electrically conductive, produce magnetic fields and electric currents, and respond strongly to electromagnetic forces. Positively charged nuclei swim in a \"sea\" of freely-moving disassociated electrons, similar to the way such charges exist in conductive metal, where this electron \"sea\"  allows matter in the plasma state to conduct electricity.\n\nA gas is usually converted to a plasma in one of two ways, e.g., either from a huge voltage difference between two points, or by exposing it to extremely high temperatures. Heating matter to high temperatures causes electrons to leave the atoms, resulting in the presence of free electrons. This creates a so-called partially ionised plasma. At very high temperatures, such as those present in stars, it is assumed that essentially all electrons are \"free\", and that a very high-energy plasma is essentially bare nuclei swimming in a sea of electrons. This forms the so-called fully ionised plasma.\n\nThe plasma state is often misunderstood, and although not freely existing under normal conditions on Earth, it is quite commonly generated by either [[lightning]], [[electric spark]]s, [[Fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lights]], [[Neon sign|neon lights]] or in [[Plasma display|plasma televisions]]. The [[solar corona|Sun's corona]], some types of [[flame]], and stars are all examples of illuminated matter in the plasma state.\n\n==Phase transitions==\n\n{{Main|Phase transitions}}\n\n{{wide image|Physics matter state transition 1 en.svg|800px|This diagram illustrates transitions between the four fundamental states of matter.}}\n\nA state of matter is also characterized by [[phase transitions]]. A phase transition indicates a change in structure and can be recognized by an abrupt change in properties. A distinct state of matter can be defined as any set of [[thermodynamic state|states]] distinguished from any other set of states by a [[phase transition]]. Water can be said to have several distinct solid states.<ref>\n{{Cite web\n |author      = M.

Such phases have been exploited by the introduction of [[liquid crystal]] technology.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n |author=D.L.

Near [[absolute zero]], a substance exists as a [[solid]]. As heat is added to this substance it melts into a liquid at its [[melting point]], boils into a gas at its [[boiling point]], and if heated high enough would enter a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] state in which the [[electrons]] are so energized that they leave their parent atoms.\n\nForms of matter that are not composed of molecules and are organized by different forces can also be considered different states of matter. [[Superfluids]] (like [[Fermionic condensate]]) and the [[quark\u2013gluon plasma]] are examples.\n\nIn a chemical equation, the state of matter of the chemicals may be shown as (s) for solid, (l) for liquid, and (g) for gas. An [[aqueous solution]] is denoted (aq). Matter in the plasma state is seldom used (if at all) in chemical equations, so there is no standard symbol to denote it. In the rare equations that plasma is used in plasma is symbolized as (p).\n\n==Non-classical states==\n\n=== Glass ===\n{{Main|Glass}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | image1    = Silica.svg\n | alt1      = Atoms of Si and O; each atom has the same number of bonds, but the overall arrangement of the atoms is random.\n | width1    = 200\n | image2    = SiO\u00b2 Quartz.svg\n | alt2      = Regular hexagonal pattern of Si and O atoms, with a Si atom at each corner and the O atoms at the centre of each side.\n | width2    = 200\n | footer    = Schematic representation of a random-network glassy form (left) and ordered crystalline lattice (right) of identical chemical composition.\n}}\n\n[[Glass]] is a non-crystalline or [[amorphous solid]] material that exhibits a [[glass transition]] when heated towards the liquid state. Glasses can be made of quite different classes of materials: inorganic networks (such as window glass, made of [[silicate]] plus additives), metallic alloys, ionic melts, aqueous solutions, molecular liquids, and polymers.\nThermodynamically, a glass is in a [[metastable state]] with respect to its crystalline counterpart. The conversion rate, however, is practically zero.\n\n=== Crystals with some degree of disorder ===\n\nA [[plastic crystal]] is a molecular solid with long-range positional order but with constituent molecules retaining rotational freedom; in an [[orientational glass]] this degree of freedom is frozen in a [[order and disorder (physics)|quenched disordered]] state.\n\nSimilarly, in a [[spin glass]] magnetic disorder is frozen.\n\n===Liquid crystal states===\n{{Main|Liquid crystal}}\n\nLiquid crystal states have properties intermediate between mobile liquids and ordered solids. Generally, they are able to flow like a liquid, but exhibiting long-range order. For example, the [[Liquid crystal#Nematic phase|nematic phase]] consists of long rod-like molecules such as [[para-azoxyanisole]], which is nematic in the temperature range {{convert|118\u2013136|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Phase Transitions of Liquid Crystal PAA in Confined Geometries|author=Shao, Y.|author2=Zerda, T.W.|journal=Journal of Physical Chemistry B|date=1998|volume=102|issue=18|pages=3387\u20133394|doi=10.1021/jp9734437}}</ref> In this state the molecules flow as in a liquid, but they all point in the same direction (within each domain) and cannot rotate freely. Like a crystalline solid, but unlike a liquid, liquid crystals react to polarized light.\n\nOther types of liquid crystals are described in the main article on these states. Several types have technological importance, for example, in [[liquid crystal display]]s.\n\n===Magnetically ordered===\n[[Transition metal]] atoms often have [[magnetic moment]]s due to the net [[spin (physics)|spin]] of electrons that remain unpaired and do not form chemical bonds. In some solids the magnetic moments on different atoms are ordered and can form a ferromagnet, an antiferromagnet or a ferrimagnet.\n\nIn a [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnet]]\u2014for instance, solid [[iron]]\u2014the magnetic moment on each atom is aligned in the same direction (within a [[magnetic domain]]). If the domains are also aligned, the solid is a permanent [[magnet]], which is magnetic even in the absence of an external [[magnetic field]]. The [[magnetization]] disappears when the magnet is heated to the [[Curie point]], which for iron is {{convert|768|C|F}}.\n\nAn [[antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnet]] has two networks of equal and opposite magnetic moments, which cancel each other out so that the net magnetization is zero. For example, in [[nickel(II) oxide]] (NiO), half the nickel atoms have moments aligned in one direction and half in the opposite direction.\n\nIn a [[ferrimagnetism|ferrimagnet]], the two networks of magnetic moments are opposite but unequal, so that cancellation is incomplete and there is a non-zero net magnetization. An example is [[magnetite]] (Fe{{sub|3}}O{{sub|4}}), which contains Fe{{sup|2+}} and Fe{{sup|3+}} ions with different magnetic moments.\n\nA [[quantum spin liquid]] (QSL) is a disordered state in a system of interacting quantum spins which preserves its disorder to very low temperatures, unlike other disordered states. It is not a liquid in physical sense, but a solid whose magnetic order is inherently disordered. The name \"liquid\" is due to an analogy with the molecular disorder in a conventional liquid. A QSL is neither a [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnet]], where magnetic domains are parallel, nor an [[Antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnet]], where the magnetic domains are antiparallel; instead, the magnetic domains are randomly oriented. This can be realized e.g. by [[Geometrical frustration|geometrically frustrated]] magnetic moments that cannot point uniformly parallel or antiparallel. When cooling down and settling to a state, the domain must \"choose\" an orientation, but if the possible states are similar in energy, one will be chosen randomly. Consequently, despite strong short-range order, there is no long-range magnetic order.\n\n===Microphase-separated===\n{{Main|Copolymer}}\n\n[[File:Sbs block copolymer.jpg|thumb|right|SBS block copolymer in [[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]]]] [[Copolymers]] can undergo microphase separation to form a diverse array of periodic nanostructures, as shown in the example of the [[Kraton (polymer)|styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer]] shown at right. Microphase separation can be understood by analogy to the phase separation between [[oil]] and water. Due to chemical incompatibility between the blocks, block copolymers undergo a similar phase separation. However, because the blocks are [[covalent bond|covalently bonded]] to each other, they cannot demix macroscopically as water and oil can, and so instead the blocks form [[nanometer]]-sized structures. Depending on the relative lengths of each block and the overall block topology of the polymer, many morphologies can be obtained, each its own phase of matter.\n\n[[Ionic liquid]]s also display microphase separation. The anion and cation are not necessarily compatible and would demix otherwise, but electric charge attraction prevents them from separating. Their anions and cations appear to diffuse within compartmentalized layers or micelles instead of freely as in a uniform liquid.<ref>\u00c1lvarez, V.H.; Dosil, N.; Gonzalez-Cabaleiro, R.; Mattedi, S.; Martin-Pastor, M.; Iglesias, M. & Navaza, J.M.: Br\u00f8nsted Ionic Liquids for Sustainable Processes: Synthesis and Physical Properties.

In a BEC, matter stops behaving as independent particles, and collapses into a single quantum state that can be described with a single, uniform wavefunction.\n\nIn the gas phase, the Bose\u2013Einstein condensate remained an unverified theoretical prediction for many years. In 1995, the research groups of [[Eric Cornell]] and [[Carl Wieman]], of [[JILA]] at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], produced the first such condensate experimentally. A Bose\u2013Einstein condensate is \"colder\" than a solid. It may occur when atoms have very similar (or the same) [[Energy level|quantum levels]], at temperatures very close to [[absolute zero]], {{convert|\u2212273.15|C|F}}.\n\n===Fermionic condensate===\n{{main|Fermionic condensate}}\nA ''fermionic condensate'' is similar to the Bose\u2013Einstein condensate but composed of [[fermion]]s.

This is in contrast to photons moving in empty space, which have no [[rest mass]], and cannot interact.\n\n===Dropleton===\n{{main|Dropleton}}\nA \"quantum fog\" of electrons and holes that flow around each other and even ripple like a liquid, rather than existing as discrete pairs.<ref name=\"Luntz\">{{cite web|last1=Luntz|first1=Stephen|title=New State of Matter Discovered|url=http://www.iflscience.com/physics/new-state-matter-discovered/#3Oe9x65kkHViXABt.99|website=IFLScience|accessdate=16 April 2017|language=en|date=3 January 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416224429/http://www.iflscience.com/physics/new-state-matter-discovered/#3Oe9x65kkHViXABt.99|archivedate=16 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==High-energy states==\n\n===Degenerate matter===\n{{Main|Degenerate matter}}\nUnder extremely high pressure, as in the cores of dead stars, ordinary matter undergoes a transition to a series of exotic states of matter collectively known as [[degenerate matter]], which are supported mainly by quantum mechanical effects. In physics, \"degenerate\" refers to two states that have the same energy and are thus interchangeable. Degenerate matter is supported by the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which prevents two [[fermion]]ic particles from occupying the same quantum state. Unlike regular plasma, degenerate plasma expands little when heated, because there are simply no momentum states left. Consequently, degenerate stars collapse into very high densities. More massive degenerate stars are smaller, because the gravitational force increases, but pressure does not increase proportionally.\n\n[[Degenerate matter|Electron-degenerate matter]] is found inside [[white dwarf]] stars. Electrons remain bound to atoms but are able to transfer to adjacent atoms. [[Degenerate matter|Neutron-degenerate matter]] is found in [[neutron star]]s. Vast gravitational pressure compresses atoms so strongly that the electrons are forced to combine with protons via inverse beta-decay, resulting in a superdense conglomeration of neutrons. Normally [[Neutron|free neutrons]] outside an atomic nucleus will [[Radioactive decay|decay]] with a half life of just under 15 minutes, but in a neutron star, the decay is overtaken by inverse decay. Cold degenerate matter is also present in planets such as [[Jupiter]] and in the even more massive [[brown dwarf]]s, which are expected to have a core with [[metallic hydrogen]]. Because of the degeneracy, more massive brown dwarfs are not significantly larger. In metals, the electrons can be modeled as a degenerate gas moving in a lattice of non-degenerate positive ions.\n\n===Quark matter===\n{{Main|QCD matter}}\nIn regular cold matter, [[quark]]s, fundamental particles of nuclear matter, are confined by the [[strong force]] into [[hadron]]s that consist of 2\u20134 quarks, such as protons and neutrons. Quark matter or quantum chromodynanamical (QCD) matter is a group of phases where the strong force is overcome and quarks are deconfined and free to move. Quark matter phases occur at extremely high densities or temperatures, and there are no known ways to produce them in equilibrium in the laboratory; in ordinary conditions, any quark matter formed immediately undergoes radioactive decay.\n\n[[Strange matter]] is a type of [[quark matter]] that is suspected to exist inside some neutron stars close to the [[Tolman\u2013Oppenheimer\u2013Volkoff limit]] (approximately 2\u20133 [[solar mass]]es), although there is no direct evidence of its existence. In strange matter, part of the energy available manifests as [[strange quark]]s, a heavier analogue of the common [[down quark]]. It may be stable at lower energy states once formed, although this is not known.\n\n[[Quark\u2013gluon plasma]] is a very high-temperature phase in which [[quark]]s become free and able to move independently, rather than being perpetually bound into particles, in a sea of [[gluon]]s, subatomic particles that transmit the [[strong interaction|strong force]] that binds quarks together. This is analogous to the liberation of electrons from atoms in a plasma. This state is briefly attainable in extremely high-energy heavy ion collisions in [[particle accelerator]]s, and allows scientists to observe the properties of individual quarks, and not just theorize. Quark\u2013gluon plasma was discovered at [[CERN]] in 2000. Unlike plasma, which flows like a gas, interactions within QGP are strong and it flows like a liquid.\n\nAt high densities but relatively low temperatures, quarks are theorized to form a quark liquid whose nature is presently unknown. It forms a distinct [[Color\u2013flavor locking|color-flavor locked]] (CFL) phase at even higher densities. This phase is [[superconductive]] for color charge. These phases may occur in [[neutron star]]s but they are presently theoretical.\n\n===Color-glass condensate===\n{{Main|Color-glass condensate}}\nColor-glass condensate is a type of matter theorized to exist in atomic nuclei traveling near the speed of light. According to Einstein's theory of relativity, a high-energy nucleus appears length contracted, or compressed, along its direction of motion. As a result, the gluons inside the nucleus appear to a stationary observer as a \"gluonic wall\" traveling near the speed of light. At very high energies, the density of the gluons in this wall is seen to increase greatly. Unlike the quark\u2013gluon plasma produced in the collision of such walls, the color-glass condensate describes the walls themselves, and is an intrinsic property of the particles that can only be observed under high-energy conditions such as those at RHIC and possibly at the Large Hadron Collider as well.\n\n==Very high energy states==\nVarious theories predict new states of matter at very high energies. An unknown state has created the [[baryon asymmetry]] in the universe, but little is known about it. In [[string theory]], a [[Hagedorn temperature]] is predicted for superstrings at about 10<sup>30</sup> K, where superstrings are copiously produced. At [[Planck temperature]] (10<sup>32</sup> K), gravity becomes a significant force between individual particles. No current theory can describe these states and they cannot be produced with any foreseeable experiment. However, these states are important in [[cosmology]] because the universe may have passed through these states in the [[Big Bang]].\n\nThe '''[[gravitational singularity]]''' predicted by [[general relativity]] to exist at the center of a [[black hole]] is ''not'' a phase of matter; it is not a material object at all (although the mass-energy of matter contributed to its creation) but rather a property of [[spacetime]] at a location. It could be argued, of course, that all particles are properties of spacetime at a location,<ref>{{cite book|author1=David Chalmers|author2=David Manley|author3=Ryan Wasserman|title=Metametaphysics: New Essays on the Foundations of Ontology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6nqzIi16CY0C&pg=PA378|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-954604-6|pages=378\u2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917070144/http://books.google.com/books?id=6nqzIi16CY0C&pg=PA378|archivedate=17 September 2014}}</ref> leaving a half-note of controversy on the subject.\n\n==Other proposed states==\n\n===Supersolid===\n{{Main|Supersolid}}\nA supersolid is a spatially ordered material (that is, a solid or crystal) with superfluid properties.

Thom (Vanja Rukavina) and Celia (Denise Rebergen) are standing on a bridge, arguing. Thom says both of them need to follow their passions; his is to be an astronaut and hers is the field of robotics. Celia, however, correctly concludes that Thom is scared of her robotic hand and breaks up with him.\n\nForty years later, killer robots created by Celia have taken over a deserted [[Amsterdam]]. Atop of a modified, futuristic [[Oude Kerk (Amsterdam)|Oude Kerk]], Barley (Sergio Hasselbaink) remotely activates the lights of a flying vehicle. Giant quadrupedal robots immediately attack the vehicle. With the robots distracted, Barley lowers an older Thom (Derek de Lint) into the Oude Kerk. There, a small team of scientists have prepared [[augmented reality]] projectors and are preparing to simulate the same bridge location shown earlier in the film, along with a robot in containment. They appear to be attempting to overwrite the memories of the trapped robot. The captain (Rogier Schippers) commands the scientists to start. Thom walks into the simulation, at which point his physical appearance transforms into the younger version of himself. One of the scientists then transforms the robot into Celia.\n\nThom relives the breakup moment in the simulation, in hopes of calming Celia and neutralizing the robots. The captain, using a [[teleprompter]], orders Thom to respond to Celia's conclusion with \"Celia, I love your robot hand\", but Thom instead says \"Listen, Celia, I was young, and a dick, but that's no reason to destroy the world.\" Celia grabs Thom by the face and seemingly prepares to kill him. The captain and his team panic, as this sentence has previously been tested and proven not to work. Scientists' attempts to abort the simulation, however, fails. Meanwhile, the killer robots break into Oude Kerk. Barley opens fire and other scientists join the fray using unconventional energy weapons.\n\nThom, nevertheless, is not harmed. As the memory overwrite process reaches completion, he ends the simulation by saying, \"The world's changed, Celia. Maybe we can too.\" The trapped robot shows signs of calming down. Thom and \"Celia\" embrace as the other robots close in on them. Since they are not showing signs of aggression, it is implied that the experiment has ended successfully. The captain proclaims that it had lessons for them.\n\nIn a post credit scene, a breathless Barley is shown siting atop a heap of fallen robots, sipping mango juice.\n\n==Technical information==\nThe live-action footage was filmed digitally using a Sony F65 [[CineAlta]] digital motion picture camera.

One of the scientists then transforms the robot into Celia.\n\nThom relives the breakup moment in the simulation, in hopes of calming Celia and neutralizing the robots. The captain, using a [[teleprompter]], orders Thom to respond to Celia's conclusion with \"Celia, I love your robot hand\", but Thom instead says \"Listen, Celia, I was young, and a dick, but that's no reason to destroy the world.\" Celia grabs Thom by the face and seemingly prepares to kill him. The captain and his team panic, as this sentence has previously been tested and proven not to work. Scientists' attempts to abort the simulation, however, fails. Meanwhile, the killer robots break into Oude Kerk. Barley opens fire and other scientists join the fray using unconventional energy weapons.\n\nThom, nevertheless, is not harmed. As the memory overwrite process reaches completion, he ends the simulation by saying, \"The world's changed, Celia. Maybe we can too.\" The trapped robot shows signs of calming down. Thom and \"Celia\" embrace as the other robots close in on them. Since they are not showing signs of aggression, it is implied that the experiment has ended successfully. The captain proclaims that it had lessons for them.\n\nIn a post credit scene, a breathless Barley is shown siting atop a heap of fallen robots, sipping mango juice.\n\n==Technical information==\nThe live-action footage was filmed digitally using a Sony F65 [[CineAlta]] digital motion picture camera.

He supported an idea of authoritarian German state, dominance of Germany over Europe and was hostile to Germany's eastern neighbours. After his applications for honorary Aryan status were rejected, due to his Jewish ancestry and increased persecution of Jewish people by Nazis, he was forced to emigrate to the [[United Kingdom]] and later to the [[United States]] during the [[Second World War]], after which he became opposed to the Nazi regime. Rothfels returned to [[West Germany]] after 1945 where he continued to influence history teaching and became an influential figure among West German scholars.\n\n==Biography==\nRothfels was born to a wealthy [[Jewish]] family in [[Kassel]], [[Hesse-Nassau]]. In 1910, he converted to [[Lutheranism]]. He converted to Protestantism before the [[First World War]] broke out.<ref>War Stories: The Search for a Usable Past in the Federal Republic of Germany\nRobert G. Moeller, page 57,University of California Press 2003</ref> He was studying history and philosophy at [[Heidelberg University]] when [[World War I]] broke out in 1914. As a student, Rothfels had been a leading pupil of [[Friedrich Meinecke]]. Rothfels served in the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] as a reserve officer and was badly wounded near [[Soissons]]. He lost one of his legs and was in a hospital until 1917.<ref name=\"Klemperer page 381\">Klemperer, Klemens von \"Hans Rothfels, 1891\u20131976\" pages 381\u2013383 from ''Central European History'', Volume IX, Issue # 4, December 1976 page 381</ref> He was awarded the [[Iron Cross]], Second Class. In 1918, Rothfels's dissertation on [[Carl von Clausewitz]], \"Carl von Clausewitz: Politik und Krieg\", led to Heidelberg granting him a degree in History. In 1920, Rothfels's dissertation was published as a book. In 1922, he edited and published a collection of Clausewitz's private letters. In addition, Rothfels published several collections of [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s letters, and was the first historian to be authorized by the Bismarck family to publish the Iron Chancellor's correspondence. Rothfels was noted for his claim that Bismarck was neither the \"iron chancellor\" of \"banal legend\" nor an \"opportunist\", but rather a profoundly religious man struggling to deal with a reality that whose full complexity was only understandable to God.<ref name=\"Klemperer page 381\"/> He defended Bismarck's Germanization policies against Poles claiming they were \"defensive\".<ref>Dzieje Wielkopolski Volume 2, page 888, Czes\u0142aw \u0141uczak, Wydawnictwo Pozna\u0144skie, 1973 -</ref>\n\nBetween 1924 and 1926, Rothfels taught at the [[University of Berlin]]. From 1926 to 1934, he worked as a professor, holding the Chair of History at the [[University of K\u00f6nigsberg]]. During his time in [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], he was well known for his highly nationalistic interpretation of German history.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}} A [[reactionary]] in his politics, Rothfels was hostile towards the [[Weimar Republic]],<ref name=\"GS\"/> through combination of authoritarianism and mass national movement, he hoped, it would be destroyed, and connections with Western democracies broken,<ref name=\"GS\"/> and envisioned that on ruins of this state a new Reich would emerged formed out of East Prussian Baltic Northeast and Southeastern outposts of former [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]].<ref name=\"GS\"/> In foreign affairs, he often denounced the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and the eastern borders it had imposed on Germany.

A major interest of Rothfels in the 1920s was his belief in the obsolescence of the nation-state, and the need for a \"loosening up\" of the Versailles borders through increased protection of minorities.<ref>Klemperer, Klemens von \"Hans Rothfels, 1891\u20131976\" pages 381\u2013383 from ''Central European History'', Volume IX, Issue # 4, December 1976 page 382</ref> Rothfels promoted an idea of race classification based on readiness of non-German ethnic groups in Eastern Europe to submit themselves to rule of German Third Reich <ref name=\"GS\">German scholars and ethnic cleansing, 1919-1945Michael Fahlbusch, page 6,7,236\u2013260  Berghahn Books, 2006</ref> The Eastern and Southeastern nationalities were to be \"restructured\" and integrated with German \"[[master race]]\".<ref name=\"GS\"/> Non-Germans would have been subject to hierarchical employment conditions and essentially have status of [[indentured]] workers, based on racist criteria<ref name=\"GS\"/> Those living outside the \"German sphere\" were to be classified by hierarchy based on their \"cultural heritage\" and ruled under direction of Germans and a vassal class that would collaborated with them.<ref name=\"GS\"/>\n\nAlthough supportive of right-wing politics (according to some, he might have voted for [[Hitler]] in 1932), he was subject to increasing persecution, being [[Jew]]ish by birth.<ref>Steinweis, Alan E. Review of [http://www.sehepunkte.de/2007/02/9772.html Jan Eckel: Hans Rothfels]</ref> Eventually, Rothfels was forced to leave his university position due to his Jewish ancestry, despite intervention by [[Hermann Rauschning]] the Nazi president of Danzig Senate and [[Theodor Oberlander]], director of [[Bund Deutscher Osten|League of German East]] (Bund der Deutschen Osten) and NSDAP's East Prussian intelligence agency<ref name=\"GS\"/>  and forbidden to teach a year later. While Rothfels tried to get an honorary Aryan status with support by [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], his efforts were fruitless.<ref>Ingo Haar, Michael Fahlbusch, \"German scholars and ethnic cleansing, 1919\u20131945\", Berghahn Books, page 8 2005,</ref> Subject to increasing persecution and discrimination by the State, he reluctantly left [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] in 1938 for [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. What decided the issue for him was his experience during the [[Kristallnacht]] [[pogrom]] when his house was looted and trashed by the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] and he himself was arrested and held by the [[Gestapo]] for several hours, during which he was deprived of his crutches and beaten up. Together with his wife and their three children, Rothfels left for the United Kingdom, where he hastily began to learn [[English language|English]], a language that he subsequently mastered.\n\n===Exile===\nAfter teaching at [[St John's College, Oxford|St. John's College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] from 1938 to 1940, Rothfels was interned on the [[Isle of Man]].<ref name=\"GS\"/> During this time his only known publication was an essay from 1940<!-- could you also give the title, please?--> in which he discussed Soviet and German interaction in the [[Baltics]]. Rothfels defended German hegemony over this \"outpost of Western Europe and Western civilization\" and complained about resettlement of Germans there due to Soviet-Nazi treaties.<ref name=\"GS\"/> Rothfels left for the [[United States]], where he stayed until 1951, and took U.S. citizenship. He taught at [[Brown University]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Rhode Island]] and at the [[University of Chicago]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] where he became a professor. Considering his views at that time, a Jewish-German student was surprised that Rothfels was forced to leave Germany in the first place.<ref name=\"GS\"/>  During his time in the United States, he befriended the American publisher [[Henry Regnery]] and became actively involved in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].\n\nIn an essay published in 1943, in the book ''The Makers of Modern Strategy'' on Clausewitz, has been praised by [[Michael Howard (historian)|Michael Howard]] as the first serious essay ever published on Clausewitz in [[English language|English]]. In his essay, Rothfels argued that Clausewitz's military theories were more sophisticated than the \"Mahdi of Mass\" interpretation of Clausewitz that had been popularized by such historians as Sir [[Basil Liddell Hart]]. Rothfels argued that it was inappropriate to view Clausewitz in the context of later events; instead Rothfels insisted on understanding Clausewitz and his theory of war in the context of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and on understanding the Clausewitz the man as the key to understanding Clausewitz the military thinker. Rothfels maintained Clausewitz's personality, social background, war experience, and his schooling all needed to be understood to properly appreciate his theories about war. Most notably, Rothfels portrayed Clausewitz as a man under considerable psychological strain caused by his commoner background in the largely aristocratic Prussian Army. Through Rothfels contended that aspects of ''[[Vom Krieg]]'' were outdated due to advances in military technology and tactics, nonetheless, Rothfels felt that Clausewitz was the most important military philiosopher of all time. The U.S. military historian [[Peter Paret]] has differed with some of Rothfels's interpretation of Clausewitz, but acknowledged Rothfels as a major influence on his work on Clausewitz.\n\nIn 1948, Rothfels published his most famous book, ''The German Opposition To Hitler'', which celebrated those conservatives who attempted the [[July 20 Plot]] of 1944, which was based upon a lecture given at the University of Chicago in 1947.<ref name=\"Iggers, Georg page 257\">Iggers, Georg ''The German Conception of History'', Middletown: Connecticut; Wesleyan University Press, 1968 page 257.</ref> Rothfels, who remained a steadfast German nationalist all his life, saw the conspirators against the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|National Socialist]] regime as representative of all that was best about German life and argued that the actions of the conspirators had restored Germany's honour from the disgrace the Nazis had brought upon it. Rothfels accepted [[Edmund Burke]]'s idea that the best defenders of liberty come from the upper crust of society and cast the men and women of July 20 as a perfect example of Burke's theory. Rothfels claimed that the German opposition was motivated by the highest possible ethical and moral considerations, and asserted that there were no self-interested motives whatsoever amongst the men and women of the July 20. Rothfels argued that the actions of the July 20 conspirators were motivated a sense of ''noblesse oblige'', devotion to the principles of [[Christianity]] and the highest form of [[patriotism]]. Rothfels was fond of pointing out the difficulties involved in attempting to overthrow one's government in war-time, which in Rothfels view, was a sign of the true patriotism of the July 20 conspirators.\n\nRothfels saw Nazism as a type of [[totalitarianism]], and often argued that there was no moral difference between [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]]; in his view, the [[Cold War]] was merely a continuation of the struggle between what he called the \"conservative freedom movement\" and totalitarian forces. In particular, Rothfels was opposed to any sort of ''[[Sonderweg]]'' interpretation of [[History of Germany|German history]], and argued that [[Nazism]] was the result of the general problems of modern civilization, which Rothfels saw as based on a set of values that were overtly materialistic, secular, and dehumanizing, and which had reduced most people to a mindless mass. Rothfels wrote \"In many respects, Nationals can be considered as the final summit of an extreme consequence of the secularization movmement of the nineteenth century\".<ref name=\"Iggers, Georg page 257\"/> In Rothfels's view, the values of modern mass civilization had led most people to forget the fundamental values of [[Western culture|the West]], which in his opinion were based on respect for [[God]] and the individual. Rothfels argued that \"Modern mass civilization generates a reservoir of evil forces whose release spells barbarism...What triumphed after the pseudo-legal revolution of 1933 was in fact and to a great extent the dark forces forming the sedimment of every modern society\".<ref>Iggers, Georg ''The German Conception of History'', Middletown: Connecticut; Wesleyan University Press, 1968 pages 257\u2013258.</ref> Rothfels argued that the Nazis came to power as a result of a series of unfortunate developments that had occurred in ''Germany'' after World War I such as the Great Inflation of 1923 and the [[Great Depression]], and often criticized those in his view promoted the view that sought to equate ''Deutschum'' with Nazism such as Sir [[Lewis Bernstein Namier]], [[William L. Shirer]], [[A.J.P. Taylor]] and Sir [[John Wheeler-Bennett]]. Moreover, far from Nazism being rooted in German traditions, Rothfels claimed that the strongest opposition to Nazism came from those grounded in traditional values. In Rothfels's opinion, \"the traditions of a genuine 'Prussian militarism'\" provived the principle \"bulwark against nationalistic and demagogic excesses\".<ref name=\"Iggers, Georg page 258\">Iggers, Georg ''The German Conception of History'', Middletown: Connecticut; Wesleyan University Press, 1968 page 258.</ref> ''The German Opposition to Hitler'' ended with a call for people all over the West to embrace what Rothfels regarded as the noble ideas of the conservative opponents of Nazism, which Rothfels saw as leading to back to the higher values of the West.\n\n''The German Opposition To Hitler'' was a controversial book because Rothfels focused his attention largely  on anti-Nazis on the Right and for the most part ignored anti-Nazis on the Left.<ref name=\"Iggers, Georg page 258\"/> In addition, many felt that the book was a hagiographical treatment of anti-Nazi conservatives. His motive in writing the book was in part to prevent the emergence of a new stab-in-the-back legend that might once again undermine democracy in Germany. He was dismayed by public opinion polls taken immediately after [[World War II]] in the American zone of occupation that showed the majority of Germans had a low opinion of the men and women involved in the July 20 plot. Rothfels was determined that Germans should see them as heroes, not villains.\n\n===Return to Germany===\nIn 1951, Rothfels returned to [[West Germany]], where he taught at the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]].<ref>Klemperer, Klemens von \"Hans Rothfels, 1891\u20131976\" pages 381\u2013383 from ''Central European History'', Volume IX, Issue # 4, December 1976 page 383</ref> He worked hard for the rest of his life to exonerate German nationalism from the taint of Nazism. Upon his return to Germany, Rothfels founded the ''[[Institut f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte]]'' (Institute for Contemporary History), an historical study center devoted to the Nazi period. The institute's journal, the ''Vierteljahrshefte f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte'' (Journal for Contemporary History) has become one of the world's leading periodicals for the study of [[Nazi Germany]]. Within a few years, the ''Vierteljahrshefte f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte'' had the highest circulation of any historical journal in West Germany. During the 1950s, Rothfels was one of the few German historians who attempted a serious examination of [[the Holocaust]], which was a subject that most German historians preferred to ignore during that decade. In particular, he broke new ground by publishing [[Kurt Gerstein]]'s reports relating to the Final Solution in the first edition of the ''Vierteljahrshefte f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte'' in 1953 and another article in 1959 that examined the plight of Polish Jewry under Nazi rule.\nIn his works Rothfels aimed at minimising the German hostility to Jews, while highlighting any attempts to save them by German individuals. Crimes and support for anti-semitism were downplayed, and opposition to racial discrimination portrayed by Rothfels as dominant. As such his text produced a vision of history in which for example the 1930s were virtually absent from anti-semitism, and non-Jewish Germans were completely willing to help Jews.<ref>Biography between Structure and Agency: Central European Lives in International Historiography (Studies in German History) by Volker R. Berghahn and Simone Lassig (Aug 1, 2008), page 95-96</ref>\n\nAfter his return to Germany, Rothfels was a pioneer of contemporary history, the study of the \"epoch of those who lived at the time\" to use Rothfels's words. In Rothfels's view, contemporary history was the study of the recent past, where despite or rather because the lack of documentation caused by studying events so close to the past and the challenge of writing about events that one experienced oneself, required special patience, skill and ability of the part of the historian. In particular, Rothfels called for historians working in the field of contemporary history to approach matters in an objective and neutral matter while keeping in mind the moral questions. In practice, contemporary history came to refer history from 1914 on.\n\nAfter his return to Germany, Rothfels took a strong stand against those whose work he felt could exonerate the Nazis. In 1954, he and one of his star pupils from the University of Chicago, [[Gerhard Weinberg]] had a renowned debate on the pages of ''Vierteljahrshefte f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte'' with [[Andreas Hillgruber]] and Hans-G\u00fcnther Seraphim over the issue of whether the German [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941 had been a \"preventive war\" forced on [[Adolf Hitler]] by the possibility of Soviet attack on Germany. Hillgruber and Seraphim argued for the \"preventive war\" thesis while Rothfels and Weinberg opposed it, arguing that it was Nazi racial theories that were the origins of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The majority opinion was that Rothfels and Weinberg destroyed Seraphim's and Hillgruber's arguments. Indeed, Hillgruber himself did a volte-face and renounced his former thesis as mistaken. Later, in 1961, Rothfels took a strong stand against the American [[neo-Nazi]] historian [[David Hoggan]] who claimed that the outbreak of war in 1939 had been due to an [[United Kingdom|Anglo]]-[[Poland|Polish]] conspiracy against Germany. Also in 1961, Rothfels assisted Weinberg with the publication of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s ''[[Zweites Buch]]'' which Weinberg had discovered in 1958, and for which Rothfels wrote the introduction.\n\nAnother area of interest for Rothfels was the [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expulsion]] of the ethnic German population from [[Eastern Europe]] after [[World War II]]. In the 1950s, Rothfels worked with [[Theodor Schieder]], [[Werner Conze]] and other historians to produce the multi-volume ''Documentation of the Expulsion of Germans from East Central Europe''. Many later prominent historians such as [[Martin Broszat]], [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]] and [[Hans Mommsen]] were involved in this project.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\n==Controversy==\nIn his lifetime and since his death, Rothfels has been a very controversial figure. Many see him as apologist for the anti-democratic German Right, and in particular, his attitude towards the Weimar Republic has recently been the subject of controversy in Germany. The historian [[Ingo Haar]] in his 2000 book ''Historiker im Nationalsozialismus'' called Rothfels an enemy of the [[Weimar Republic]] and a [[Nazi sympathizer]]. The historian [[Heinrich August Winkler]] has strongly criticized Haar,<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.ifz-muenchen.de/heftarchiv/2001_4.pdf| first = Heinrich August|last =Winkler |title = Hans Rothfels \u2013 Ein Lobredner Hitlers ? | publisher =Vierteljahrshefte f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte| year = 2001 | page =643|language=de}}</ref> who had erroneously used a [[radio]] address Rothfels gave in 1930 praising [[Friedrich Ebert]], [[Gustav Stresemann]], and [[Paul von Hindenburg]] as great German leaders as a proof for Rothfels' support of Hitler. While Haar had implied the speech dates from 1933 and was addressed to Hitler after he took over power in Germany, Winkler verified the actual circumstances of the speech, which Rothfels repeated several times prior to 1933. Rothfels's critics contend that his planned 1933 radio address was too little, too late.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nRothfels and his inner circle at K\u00f6nigsberg in the early 1930s are often referred to as the ''K\u00f6nigsberg circle'' ({{lang-de|K\u00f6nigsberger Kreis}}). Its most prominent members, apart from Rothfels himself, were his students [[Theodor Schieder]] and [[Werner Conze]]. Whereas Rothfels had to emigrate, Schieder and Conze joined the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]]. They were active in the field of [[Ostforschung]], where they supported ideas such as 'dejewification' ({{lang-de|[[Entjudung]]}}). After Rothfels' return the three became leading figures among the historians of the newly founded [[West Germany]]. They soon found themselves together in a [[Schieder commission|commission led by Schieder]] that was set up by the government for documenting the [[expulsion of Germans after World War II]].\nIn 1998 the 42nd ''Deutscher Historikertag'' marked the beginning of a public debate among German historians about the \"brown history\" of their field.<ref>[http://www.zeit.de/2000/04/Beredtes_Schweigen Beredtes Schweigen], Die Zeit 2000.</ref>\n\n==Work==\n*''Carl von Clausewitz: Politik und Krieg'', D\u00fcmmlers Verlag, Berlin, 1920.\n*''Bismarck Und Der Staat; Ausgew\u00e4hlte Dokumente, Eingeleitet Von Hans Rothfels'', Stuttgart, [[Kohlhammer Verlag]], 1925.\n*\"Clausewitz\"  pages 93\u2013113 from ''The Makers of Modern Strategy'' edited by Edward Mead Earle, [[Gordon A.

He supported an idea of authoritarian German state, dominance of Germany over Europe and was hostile to Germany's eastern neighbours. After his applications for honorary Aryan status were rejected, due to his Jewish ancestry and increased persecution of Jewish people by Nazis, he was forced to emigrate to the [[United Kingdom]] and later to the [[United States]] during the [[Second World War]], after which he became opposed to the Nazi regime. Rothfels returned to [[West Germany]] after 1945 where he continued to influence history teaching and became an influential figure among West German scholars.\n\n==Biography==\nRothfels was born to a wealthy [[Jewish]] family in [[Kassel]], [[Hesse-Nassau]]. In 1910, he converted to [[Lutheranism]]. He converted to Protestantism before the [[First World War]] broke out.<ref>War Stories: The Search for a Usable Past in the Federal Republic of Germany\nRobert G. Moeller, page 57,University of California Press 2003</ref> He was studying history and philosophy at [[Heidelberg University]] when [[World War I]] broke out in 1914. As a student, Rothfels had been a leading pupil of [[Friedrich Meinecke]]. Rothfels served in the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] as a reserve officer and was badly wounded near [[Soissons]]. He lost one of his legs and was in a hospital until 1917.<ref name=\"Klemperer page 381\">Klemperer, Klemens von \"Hans Rothfels, 1891\u20131976\" pages 381\u2013383 from ''Central European History'', Volume IX, Issue # 4, December 1976 page 381</ref> He was awarded the [[Iron Cross]], Second Class. In 1918, Rothfels's dissertation on [[Carl von Clausewitz]], \"Carl von Clausewitz: Politik und Krieg\", led to Heidelberg granting him a degree in History. In 1920, Rothfels's dissertation was published as a book. In 1922, he edited and published a collection of Clausewitz's private letters. In addition, Rothfels published several collections of [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s letters, and was the first historian to be authorized by the Bismarck family to publish the Iron Chancellor's correspondence. Rothfels was noted for his claim that Bismarck was neither the \"iron chancellor\" of \"banal legend\" nor an \"opportunist\", but rather a profoundly religious man struggling to deal with a reality that whose full complexity was only understandable to God.<ref name=\"Klemperer page 381\"/> He defended Bismarck's Germanization policies against Poles claiming they were \"defensive\".<ref>Dzieje Wielkopolski Volume 2, page 888, Czes\u0142aw \u0141uczak, Wydawnictwo Pozna\u0144skie, 1973 -</ref>\n\nBetween 1924 and 1926, Rothfels taught at the [[University of Berlin]]. From 1926 to 1934, he worked as a professor, holding the Chair of History at the [[University of K\u00f6nigsberg]]. During his time in [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], he was well known for his highly nationalistic interpretation of German history.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}} A [[reactionary]] in his politics, Rothfels was hostile towards the [[Weimar Republic]],<ref name=\"GS\"/> through combination of authoritarianism and mass national movement, he hoped, it would be destroyed, and connections with Western democracies broken,<ref name=\"GS\"/> and envisioned that on ruins of this state a new Reich would emerged formed out of East Prussian Baltic Northeast and Southeastern outposts of former [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]].<ref name=\"GS\"/> In foreign affairs, he often denounced the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and the eastern borders it had imposed on Germany.

Review of [http://www.sehepunkte.de/2007/02/9772.html Jan Eckel: Hans Rothfels]</ref> Eventually, Rothfels was forced to leave his university position due to his Jewish ancestry, despite intervention by [[Hermann Rauschning]] the Nazi president of Danzig Senate and [[Theodor Oberlander]], director of [[Bund Deutscher Osten|League of German East]] (Bund der Deutschen Osten) and NSDAP's East Prussian intelligence agency<ref name=\"GS\"/>  and forbidden to teach a year later. While Rothfels tried to get an honorary Aryan status with support by [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], his efforts were fruitless.<ref>Ingo Haar, Michael Fahlbusch, \"German scholars and ethnic cleansing, 1919\u20131945\", Berghahn Books, page 8 2005,</ref> Subject to increasing persecution and discrimination by the State, he reluctantly left [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] in 1938 for [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. What decided the issue for him was his experience during the [[Kristallnacht]] [[pogrom]] when his house was looted and trashed by the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] and he himself was arrested and held by the [[Gestapo]] for several hours, during which he was deprived of his crutches and beaten up. Together with his wife and their three children, Rothfels left for the United Kingdom, where he hastily began to learn [[English language|English]], a language that he subsequently mastered.\n\n===Exile===\nAfter teaching at [[St John's College, Oxford|St. John's College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] from 1938 to 1940, Rothfels was interned on the [[Isle of Man]].<ref name=\"GS\"/> During this time his only known publication was an essay from 1940<!-- could you also give the title, please?--> in which he discussed Soviet and German interaction in the [[Baltics]]. Rothfels defended German hegemony over this \"outpost of Western Europe and Western civilization\" and complained about resettlement of Germans there due to Soviet-Nazi treaties.<ref name=\"GS\"/> Rothfels left for the [[United States]], where he stayed until 1951, and took U.S. citizenship. He taught at [[Brown University]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Rhode Island]] and at the [[University of Chicago]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] where he became a professor. Considering his views at that time, a Jewish-German student was surprised that Rothfels was forced to leave Germany in the first place.<ref name=\"GS\"/>  During his time in the United States, he befriended the American publisher [[Henry Regnery]] and became actively involved in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].\n\nIn an essay published in 1943, in the book ''The Makers of Modern Strategy'' on Clausewitz, has been praised by [[Michael Howard (historian)|Michael Howard]] as the first serious essay ever published on Clausewitz in [[English language|English]]. In his essay, Rothfels argued that Clausewitz's military theories were more sophisticated than the \"Mahdi of Mass\" interpretation of Clausewitz that had been popularized by such historians as Sir [[Basil Liddell Hart]]. Rothfels argued that it was inappropriate to view Clausewitz in the context of later events; instead Rothfels insisted on understanding Clausewitz and his theory of war in the context of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and on understanding the Clausewitz the man as the key to understanding Clausewitz the military thinker. Rothfels maintained Clausewitz's personality, social background, war experience, and his schooling all needed to be understood to properly appreciate his theories about war. Most notably, Rothfels portrayed Clausewitz as a man under considerable psychological strain caused by his commoner background in the largely aristocratic Prussian Army. Through Rothfels contended that aspects of ''[[Vom Krieg]]'' were outdated due to advances in military technology and tactics, nonetheless, Rothfels felt that Clausewitz was the most important military philiosopher of all time. The U.S. military historian [[Peter Paret]] has differed with some of Rothfels's interpretation of Clausewitz, but acknowledged Rothfels as a major influence on his work on Clausewitz.\n\nIn 1948, Rothfels published his most famous book, ''The German Opposition To Hitler'', which celebrated those conservatives who attempted the [[July 20 Plot]] of 1944, which was based upon a lecture given at the University of Chicago in 1947.<ref name=\"Iggers, Georg page 257\">Iggers, Georg ''The German Conception of History'', Middletown: Connecticut; Wesleyan University Press, 1968 page 257.</ref> Rothfels, who remained a steadfast German nationalist all his life, saw the conspirators against the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|National Socialist]] regime as representative of all that was best about German life and argued that the actions of the conspirators had restored Germany's honour from the disgrace the Nazis had brought upon it. Rothfels accepted [[Edmund Burke]]'s idea that the best defenders of liberty come from the upper crust of society and cast the men and women of July 20 as a perfect example of Burke's theory. Rothfels claimed that the German opposition was motivated by the highest possible ethical and moral considerations, and asserted that there were no self-interested motives whatsoever amongst the men and women of the July 20. Rothfels argued that the actions of the July 20 conspirators were motivated a sense of ''noblesse oblige'', devotion to the principles of [[Christianity]] and the highest form of [[patriotism]]. Rothfels was fond of pointing out the difficulties involved in attempting to overthrow one's government in war-time, which in Rothfels view, was a sign of the true patriotism of the July 20 conspirators.\n\nRothfels saw Nazism as a type of [[totalitarianism]], and often argued that there was no moral difference between [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]]; in his view, the [[Cold War]] was merely a continuation of the struggle between what he called the \"conservative freedom movement\" and totalitarian forces. In particular, Rothfels was opposed to any sort of ''[[Sonderweg]]'' interpretation of [[History of Germany|German history]], and argued that [[Nazism]] was the result of the general problems of modern civilization, which Rothfels saw as based on a set of values that were overtly materialistic, secular, and dehumanizing, and which had reduced most people to a mindless mass. Rothfels wrote \"In many respects, Nationals can be considered as the final summit of an extreme consequence of the secularization movmement of the nineteenth century\".<ref name=\"Iggers, Georg page 257\"/> In Rothfels's view, the values of modern mass civilization had led most people to forget the fundamental values of [[Western culture|the West]], which in his opinion were based on respect for [[God]] and the individual. Rothfels argued that \"Modern mass civilization generates a reservoir of evil forces whose release spells barbarism...What triumphed after the pseudo-legal revolution of 1933 was in fact and to a great extent the dark forces forming the sedimment of every modern society\".<ref>Iggers, Georg ''The German Conception of History'', Middletown: Connecticut; Wesleyan University Press, 1968 pages 257\u2013258.</ref> Rothfels argued that the Nazis came to power as a result of a series of unfortunate developments that had occurred in ''Germany'' after World War I such as the Great Inflation of 1923 and the [[Great Depression]], and often criticized those in his view promoted the view that sought to equate ''Deutschum'' with Nazism such as Sir [[Lewis Bernstein Namier]], [[William L. Shirer]], [[A.J.P. Taylor]] and Sir [[John Wheeler-Bennett]]. Moreover, far from Nazism being rooted in German traditions, Rothfels claimed that the strongest opposition to Nazism came from those grounded in traditional values. In Rothfels's opinion, \"the traditions of a genuine 'Prussian militarism'\" provived the principle \"bulwark against nationalistic and demagogic excesses\".<ref name=\"Iggers, Georg page 258\">Iggers, Georg ''The German Conception of History'', Middletown: Connecticut; Wesleyan University Press, 1968 page 258.</ref> ''The German Opposition to Hitler'' ended with a call for people all over the West to embrace what Rothfels regarded as the noble ideas of the conservative opponents of Nazism, which Rothfels saw as leading to back to the higher values of the West.\n\n''The German Opposition To Hitler'' was a controversial book because Rothfels focused his attention largely  on anti-Nazis on the Right and for the most part ignored anti-Nazis on the Left.<ref name=\"Iggers, Georg page 258\"/> In addition, many felt that the book was a hagiographical treatment of anti-Nazi conservatives. His motive in writing the book was in part to prevent the emergence of a new stab-in-the-back legend that might once again undermine democracy in Germany. He was dismayed by public opinion polls taken immediately after [[World War II]] in the American zone of occupation that showed the majority of Germans had a low opinion of the men and women involved in the July 20 plot. Rothfels was determined that Germans should see them as heroes, not villains.\n\n===Return to Germany===\nIn 1951, Rothfels returned to [[West Germany]], where he taught at the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]].<ref>Klemperer, Klemens von \"Hans Rothfels, 1891\u20131976\" pages 381\u2013383 from ''Central European History'', Volume IX, Issue # 4, December 1976 page 383</ref> He worked hard for the rest of his life to exonerate German nationalism from the taint of Nazism. Upon his return to Germany, Rothfels founded the ''[[Institut f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte]]'' (Institute for Contemporary History), an historical study center devoted to the Nazi period. The institute's journal, the ''Vierteljahrshefte f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte'' (Journal for Contemporary History) has become one of the world's leading periodicals for the study of [[Nazi Germany]]. Within a few years, the ''Vierteljahrshefte f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte'' had the highest circulation of any historical journal in West Germany. During the 1950s, Rothfels was one of the few German historians who attempted a serious examination of [[the Holocaust]], which was a subject that most German historians preferred to ignore during that decade. In particular, he broke new ground by publishing [[Kurt Gerstein]]'s reports relating to the Final Solution in the first edition of the ''Vierteljahrshefte f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte'' in 1953 and another article in 1959 that examined the plight of Polish Jewry under Nazi rule.\nIn his works Rothfels aimed at minimising the German hostility to Jews, while highlighting any attempts to save them by German individuals. Crimes and support for anti-semitism were downplayed, and opposition to racial discrimination portrayed by Rothfels as dominant. As such his text produced a vision of history in which for example the 1930s were virtually absent from anti-semitism, and non-Jewish Germans were completely willing to help Jews.<ref>Biography between Structure and Agency: Central European Lives in International Historiography (Studies in German History) by Volker R. Berghahn and Simone Lassig (Aug 1, 2008), page 95-96</ref>\n\nAfter his return to Germany, Rothfels was a pioneer of contemporary history, the study of the \"epoch of those who lived at the time\" to use Rothfels's words. In Rothfels's view, contemporary history was the study of the recent past, where despite or rather because the lack of documentation caused by studying events so close to the past and the challenge of writing about events that one experienced oneself, required special patience, skill and ability of the part of the historian. In particular, Rothfels called for historians working in the field of contemporary history to approach matters in an objective and neutral matter while keeping in mind the moral questions. In practice, contemporary history came to refer history from 1914 on.\n\nAfter his return to Germany, Rothfels took a strong stand against those whose work he felt could exonerate the Nazis. In 1954, he and one of his star pupils from the University of Chicago, [[Gerhard Weinberg]] had a renowned debate on the pages of ''Vierteljahrshefte f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte'' with [[Andreas Hillgruber]] and Hans-G\u00fcnther Seraphim over the issue of whether the German [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941 had been a \"preventive war\" forced on [[Adolf Hitler]] by the possibility of Soviet attack on Germany. Hillgruber and Seraphim argued for the \"preventive war\" thesis while Rothfels and Weinberg opposed it, arguing that it was Nazi racial theories that were the origins of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The majority opinion was that Rothfels and Weinberg destroyed Seraphim's and Hillgruber's arguments. Indeed, Hillgruber himself did a volte-face and renounced his former thesis as mistaken. Later, in 1961, Rothfels took a strong stand against the American [[neo-Nazi]] historian [[David Hoggan]] who claimed that the outbreak of war in 1939 had been due to an [[United Kingdom|Anglo]]-[[Poland|Polish]] conspiracy against Germany. Also in 1961, Rothfels assisted Weinberg with the publication of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s ''[[Zweites Buch]]'' which Weinberg had discovered in 1958, and for which Rothfels wrote the introduction.\n\nAnother area of interest for Rothfels was the [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expulsion]] of the ethnic German population from [[Eastern Europe]] after [[World War II]]. In the 1950s, Rothfels worked with [[Theodor Schieder]], [[Werner Conze]] and other historians to produce the multi-volume ''Documentation of the Expulsion of Germans from East Central Europe''. Many later prominent historians such as [[Martin Broszat]], [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]] and [[Hans Mommsen]] were involved in this project.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\n==Controversy==\nIn his lifetime and since his death, Rothfels has been a very controversial figure. Many see him as apologist for the anti-democratic German Right, and in particular, his attitude towards the Weimar Republic has recently been the subject of controversy in Germany. The historian [[Ingo Haar]] in his 2000 book ''Historiker im Nationalsozialismus'' called Rothfels an enemy of the [[Weimar Republic]] and a [[Nazi sympathizer]]. The historian [[Heinrich August Winkler]] has strongly criticized Haar,<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.ifz-muenchen.de/heftarchiv/2001_4.pdf| first = Heinrich August|last =Winkler |title = Hans Rothfels \u2013 Ein Lobredner Hitlers ? | publisher =Vierteljahrshefte f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte| year = 2001 | page =643|language=de}}</ref> who had erroneously used a [[radio]] address Rothfels gave in 1930 praising [[Friedrich Ebert]], [[Gustav Stresemann]], and [[Paul von Hindenburg]] as great German leaders as a proof for Rothfels' support of Hitler. While Haar had implied the speech dates from 1933 and was addressed to Hitler after he took over power in Germany, Winkler verified the actual circumstances of the speech, which Rothfels repeated several times prior to 1933. Rothfels's critics contend that his planned 1933 radio address was too little, too late.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nRothfels and his inner circle at K\u00f6nigsberg in the early 1930s are often referred to as the ''K\u00f6nigsberg circle'' ({{lang-de|K\u00f6nigsberger Kreis}}). Its most prominent members, apart from Rothfels himself, were his students [[Theodor Schieder]] and [[Werner Conze]]. Whereas Rothfels had to emigrate, Schieder and Conze joined the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]]. They were active in the field of [[Ostforschung]], where they supported ideas such as 'dejewification' ({{lang-de|[[Entjudung]]}}). After Rothfels' return the three became leading figures among the historians of the newly founded [[West Germany]].
