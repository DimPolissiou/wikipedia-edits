The selection of content for the record took almost a year. Sagan and his associates assembled 115 images and a variety of natural sounds, such as those made by surf, wind, thunder and animals (including the songs of [[Birdsong|birds]] and [[whale sound|whales]]). To this they added musical selections from different cultures and eras, spoken greetings in 55 ancient and modern languages including a spoken greeting in English by [[United Nations|U.N.]] [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] [[Kurt Waldheim]], other human sounds, like footsteps and laughter (Sagan's),<ref name=\"TA-20170630\" /> and a printed message from U.S. president [[Jimmy Carter]]. The record also includes the inspirational message ''[[Per aspera ad astra]]'' in [[Morse code]].\n\n{{Listen\n| filename    =Voyager Golden Record greeting in English.ogg\n| title       = \"Hello from the children of Planet Earth\"\n| description = A child's greeting in English recorded on the Voyager Golden Record\n| type         = speech\n}}\nThe collection of images includes many photographs and diagrams both in black and white, and color. The first images are of scientific interest, showing mathematical and physical quantities, the [[Solar System]] and its planets, [[DNA]], and human [[Outline of human anatomy|anatomy]] and [[Human reproduction|reproduction]]. Care was taken to include not only pictures of humanity, but also some of animals, insects, plants and landscapes. Images of humanity depict a broad range of cultures. These images show food, architecture, and humans in portraits as well as going about their day-to-day lives. Many pictures are annotated with one or more indications of scales of time, size, or mass. Some images contain indications of [[chemical composition]]. All measures used on the pictures are defined in the first few images using physical references that are likely to be consistent anywhere in the [[universe]].\n\nThe musical selection is also varied, featuring works by composers such as [[J.S. Bach]] (interpreted by [[Glenn Gould]]), [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] (played by the [[Budapest String Quartet]]), and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]. The disc also includes music by [[Guan Pinghu]], [[Blind Willie Johnson]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[Kesarbai Kerkar]], [[Valya Balkanska]], and electronic composer [[Laurie Spiegel]], as well as [[Azerbaijani folk music]] ([[Mugham]]) by oboe player [[Kamil Jalilov]].<ref>Anne Kressler.

The stylus is in the correct position to play the record from the beginning. Written around it in [[Binary Arithmetic|binary notation]] is the correct time of one rotation of the record, 3.6 seconds, expressed in time units of 0.70 billionths of a second, the time period associated with a [[Hydrogen line|fundamental transition of the hydrogen atom]]. The drawing indicates that the record should be played from the outside in. Below this drawing is a side view of the record and stylus, with a binary number giving the time to play one side of the record\u2014about an hour (more precisely, between 53 and 54 minutes).\n\nThe information in the upper right-hand portion of the cover is designed to show how pictures are to be constructed from the recorded signals. The top drawing shows the typical signal that occurs at the start of a picture. The picture is made from this signal, which traces the picture as a series of vertical lines, similar to analog [[television]] (in which the picture is a series of horizontal lines). Picture lines 1, 2 and 3 are noted in binary numbers, and the duration of one of the \"picture lines,\" about 8 milliseconds, is noted. The drawing immediately below shows how these lines are to be drawn vertically, with staggered \"interlace\" to give the correct picture rendition. Immediately below this is a drawing of an entire picture [[Raster scan|raster]], showing that there are 512 (2<sup>9</sup>) vertical lines in a complete picture. Immediately below this is a replica of the first picture on the record to permit the recipients to verify that they are decoding the signals correctly. A circle was used in this picture to ensure that the recipients use the correct ratio of horizontal to vertical height in picture reconstruction. Color images were represented by three images in sequence, one each for red, green, and blue components of the image. A color image of the spectrum of the sun was included for calibration purposes.\n\nThe drawing in the lower left-hand corner of the cover is the pulsar map previously sent as part of the plaques on Pioneers 10 and 11. It shows the location of the Solar System with respect to 14 [[pulsar]]s, whose precise periods are given. The drawing containing two circles in the lower right-hand corner is a drawing of the [[hydrogen atom]] in its two lowest states, with a connecting line and digit 1 to indicate that the time interval associated with the transition from one state to the other is to be used as the fundamental time scale, both for the time given on the cover and in the decoded pictures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/voyager_record/index_voyager.html |title=Voyager Record |website=Jet Propulsion Laboratory |publisher=NASA |accessdate=May 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Manufacturing==\n{{Multiple image\n| image1  = Voyager golden record gold plating.jpg\n| width1  = 220\n| image2  = PIA17035 Mementos of Earth.jpg\n| width2  = 134\n| footer  = Gold plating at the James G.

The selection of content for the record took almost a year. Sagan and his associates assembled 115 images and a variety of natural sounds, such as those made by surf, wind, thunder and animals (including the songs of [[Birdsong|birds]] and [[whale sound|whales]]). To this they added musical selections from different cultures and eras, spoken greetings in 55 ancient and modern languages including a spoken greeting in English by [[United Nations|U.N.]] [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] [[Kurt Waldheim]], other human sounds, like footsteps and laughter (Sagan's),<ref name=\"TA-20170630\" /> and a printed message from U.S. president [[Jimmy Carter]].

The first images are of scientific interest, showing mathematical and physical quantities, the [[Solar System]] and its planets, [[DNA]], and human [[Outline of human anatomy|anatomy]] and [[Human reproduction|reproduction]]. Care was taken to include not only pictures of humanity, but also some of animals, insects, plants and landscapes. Images of humanity depict a broad range of cultures. These images show food, architecture, and humans in portraits as well as going about their day-to-day lives. Many pictures are annotated with one or more indications of scales of time, size, or mass. Some images contain indications of [[chemical composition]]. All measures used on the pictures are defined in the first few images using physical references that are likely to be consistent anywhere in the [[universe]].\n\nThe musical selection is also varied, featuring works by composers such as [[J.S. Bach]] (interpreted by [[Glenn Gould]]), [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] (played by the [[Budapest String Quartet]]), and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]. The disc also includes music by [[Guan Pinghu]], [[Blind Willie Johnson]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[Kesarbai Kerkar]], [[Valya Balkanska]], and electronic composer [[Laurie Spiegel]], as well as [[Azerbaijani folk music]] ([[Mugham]]) by oboe player [[Kamil Jalilov]].<ref>Anne Kressler.

The stylus is in the correct position to play the record from the beginning. Written around it in [[Binary Arithmetic|binary arithmetic]] is the correct time of one rotation of the record, 3.6 seconds, expressed in time units of 0.70 billionths of a second, the time period associated with a [[Hydrogen line|fundamental transition of the hydrogen atom]]. The drawing indicates that the record should be played from the outside in. Below this drawing is a side view of the record and stylus, with a binary number giving the time to play one side of the record\u2014about an hour (more precisely, between 53 and 54 minutes).\n\nThe information in the upper right-hand portion of the cover is designed to show how pictures are to be constructed from the recorded signals. The top drawing shows the typical signal that occurs at the start of a picture. The picture is made from this signal, which traces the picture as a series of vertical lines, similar to analog [[television]] (in which the picture is a series of horizontal lines). Picture lines 1, 2 and 3 are noted in binary numbers, and the duration of one of the \"picture lines,\" about 8 milliseconds, is noted. The drawing immediately below shows how these lines are to be drawn vertically, with staggered \"interlace\" to give the correct picture rendition. Immediately below this is a drawing of an entire picture [[Raster scan|raster]], showing that there are 512 (2<sup>9</sup>) vertical lines in a complete picture. Immediately below this is a replica of the first picture on the record to permit the recipients to verify that they are decoding the signals correctly. A circle was used in this picture to ensure that the recipients use the correct ratio of horizontal to vertical height in picture reconstruction. Color images were represented by three images in sequence, one each for red, green, and blue components of the image. A color image of the spectrum of the sun was included for calibration purposes.\n\nThe drawing in the lower left-hand corner of the cover is the pulsar map previously sent as part of the plaques on Pioneers 10 and 11. It shows the location of the Solar System with respect to 14 [[pulsar]]s, whose precise periods are given. The drawing containing two circles in the lower right-hand corner is a drawing of the [[hydrogen atom]] in its two lowest states, with a connecting line and digit 1 to indicate that the time interval associated with the transition from one state to the other is to be used as the fundamental time scale, both for the time given on the cover and in the decoded pictures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/voyager_record/index_voyager.html |title=Voyager Record |website=Jet Propulsion Laboratory |publisher=NASA |accessdate=May 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Manufacturing==\n{{Multiple image\n| image1  = Voyager golden record gold plating.jpg\n| width1  = 220\n| image2  = PIA17035 Mementos of Earth.jpg\n| width2  = 134\n| footer  = Gold plating at the James G.

Since then developments include the expansion of its academic programmes portfolio, establishment of  partnerships with industries and universities, programme accreditation by professional bodies, and intensification of research activities.\n\nEarly 2016, the name of the university was changed from ''Institut Teknologi Brunei'' into ''Universiti Teknologi Brunei''.\n\n==History==\n\nIn November 1980, the Director of Education submitted a proposal to the government calling for the establishment of Institut Teknologi Brunei. He suggested that such an institution be created to expand the provision of technical education in Brunei Darussalam. A little less than two years later, in February 1982, the proposal was accepted by the government.\n\nAs the physical establishment of the institute was expected to take some time to complete, Pusat Latihan Teknikal Brunei was developed and expanded as an embryo for the institute. Towards the later stages of its establishment in October 1985, the institute was assisted by Leeds Polytechnic in the development of its curriculum, secondment of staff, procurement of books and equipment, and recruitment of contract staff in the United Kingdom. Less than five months later, the institute took in its first intake of students.\n\n==Research==\nResearch efforts are focused on oil and gas, green technology and water. \n* The UTB Centre for Transport Research (CfTR) was established to carry out research activities that include policy studies, transport modelling and intelligent transport system, and focuses on the areas of transport safety, highway and geotechnics, and traffic.

Since then developments include the expansion of its academic programmes portfolio, establishment of  partnerships with industries and universities, programme accreditation by professional bodies, and intensification of research activities.\n\nEarly 2016, the name of the university was changed from ''Institut Teknologi Brunei'' into ''Universiti Teknologi Brunei''.\n\n==History==\n\nIn November 1980, the Director of Education submitted a proposal to the government calling for the establishment of Institut Teknologi Brunei. He suggested that such an institution be created to expand the provision of technical education in Brunei Darussalam. A little less than two years later, in February 1982, the proposal was accepted by the government.\n\nAs the physical establishment of the institute was expected to take some time to complete, Pusat Latihan Teknikal Brunei was developed and expanded as an embryo for the institute. Towards the later stages of its establishment in October 1985, the institute was assisted by Leeds Polytechnic in the development of its curriculum, secondment of staff, procurement of books and equipment, and recruitment of contract staff in the United Kingdom. Less than five months later, the institute took in its first intake of students.\n\n==Research==\nResearch efforts are focused on oil and gas, green technology and water. \n* The UTB Centre for Transport Research (CfTR) was established to carry out research activities that include policy studies, transport modelling and intelligent transport system, and focuses on the areas of transport safety, highway and geotechnics, and traffic. The newly established Centre for Innovative Engineering aims to become a centre for multidisciplinary translational research.\n* The UTB Centre for Road Safety Studies was established to support Road Safety Policy and strategy development through research-generated evidence, date and recommendations.\n\n==Programmes==\nUTB is home to around 2,303 students and 140 faculty members.

A [[druid]] explains the meaning of the stone, and says the number of cries the stone made is the number of kings who will follow Conn, but he is not the man to name them. A magical mist arises, and a horseman approaches who throws three spears towards Conn, then asks him and the druid to follow him to his house, which stands on a plain by a golden tree. They enter, and are welcomed by a woman in a gold crown. First they see a silver vat, bound with gold hoops, full of red ale, and a golden cup and serving spoon. Then they see a phantom, a tall beautiful man, on a throne, who introduces himself as [[Lugh]]. The woman is the [[Loathly lady|sovereignty]] of Ireland, and she serves Conn a meal consisting of an ox's rib {{convert|24|ft|m|-1|disp=x| long (| approximately)}}, and a boar's rib.{{efn|Here, the Irish foot is ''[[wikt:traig|traig]]''.}} When she serves drinks, she asks \"To whom shall this cup be given?\", and Lugh recites a poem which tells Conn how many years he will reign, and the names of the kings who will follow him.

The two kings fled to Conn, and married his daughters, Saraid and Sadb respectively. Mug Neit made war on Conn, but was defeated and killed after two battles in [[County Offaly]]. Mug Nuadat led his father's forces in retreat through Munster, fighting Conn to a standstill before escaping by sea to Beare Island (in Irish, ''Oil\u00e9an B\u00e9arra,'' now called [[Bere Island]]), and thence to Spain. Conn restored Conaire and Mac Niad to their kingdoms and withdrew.\n\nNine years later, Mug Nuadat, who had married the daughter of the king of Spain, landed with an army near [[Bantry Bay]] and forced Conaire and Mac Niad to submit to his overlordship. With the kings of Ulster and Leinster, he marched north to Mag nAi and forced Conn to make a treaty with him, dividing Ireland between them: Conn controlling the north, or ''[[Leath Cuinn|Leth Cuinn]]'' (\"Conn's half\"), and Mug Nuadat the south, or ''Leth Moga'' (\"Mug's half\"), with the border lying between [[Galway]] in the west and [[Dublin]] in the east.\n\nAfter fifteen years of peace Mug Nuadat broke the treaty and declared war, along with the kings of Ulster and Leinster. He led his army to Mag Leana, near [[Tullamore]], County Offaly. Conn retreated to Connacht, gathered his forces, and retook [[Kingdom of Mide|Meath]] from the king of Ulster. He then marched south to Mag Leana and destroyed Mug Nuadat's army in a surprise night attack on his camp. Mug Nuadat was killed in the fighting, and Conn became king of all of Ireland.<ref>[[Eugene O'Curry]] (ed. & trans.)

In his account Mug Nuadat obtains an army from the king of Leinster and expels the kings of Munster, here Lugaid Allathach, D\u00e1ire Dornmhor and Aonghus. Aonghus flees to Conn, who gives him an army with which to reclaim his kingdom, but Mug Nuadat defeats this and a further nine attempts by Conn to drive him out of Munster, forcing Conn to divide Ireland with him. When hostilities break out again, Conn and Mug Nuadat's armies gather for battle at Mag Leana, but Conn kills Mug Nuadat in his bed in an early morning attack.<ref>[[Geoffrey Keating]], ''Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn'' [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100054/text050.html 1.40]</ref>\n\nAccording to a medieval source, the hero [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] was born in Conn's time. His father, [[Cumhall]], a warrior in Conn's service, was a suitor of [[Muirne]], daughter of the druid [[Tadg mac Nuadat]], but Tadg refused his suit, so Cumhall abducted her. Conn went to war against him, and Cumhall was killed by [[Goll mac Morna]] in the Battle of Cnucha. But Muirne was already pregnant, and Tadg rejected her, ordering her to be burned. She fled to Conn, and Conn put her under the protection of Cumhall's brother-in-law Fiacal mac Conchinn. It was in Fiacal's house that she gave birth to a son, Deimne, who was later renamed Fionn.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/f01.html \"The Cause of the Battle of Cnucha\"], [[Tom Peete Cross]] & Clark Harris Slover (eds.), ''Ancient Irish Tales'', Henry Holt & Co, 1936, pp. 357\u2013359</ref> When he was ten, Fionn came to Tara put himself into Conn's service. He learned that every year at [[Samhain]], the monster [[Aillen]] would put everyone at Tara to sleep with his music, and burn down the palace with his fiery breath. Fionn killed Aillen, having kept himself awake by pressing the head of his spear to his forehead, and warded off Aillen's flame with his magical cloak, and Conn made him head of the ''[[fianna]]'' in place of Goll.<ref>Standish James O'Grady (trans.), ''[http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/colloquy_ogrady.pdf The Colloquy with the Ancients]'', In Parentheses Publications, pp. 46\u201348</ref>\n\n===Family===\nConn had two sons, [[Connla the Ruddy|Connla]] and [[Art mac Cuinn|Art]]. Connla fell in love with a fairy woman from [[Mag Mell]], and went with her to her otherworld home in her crystal boat, leaving Art alone. After that Art was known as ''\u00d3enfer'' \u2013 the \"lone\" or \"solitary\".<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/connla.html \"The Adventures of Connla the Fair\"], Cross & Slover 1936, pp. 488\u2013490</ref> Connla's tale is told in the ''[[Echtra Condla]]''.\n\nAfter Conn's wife [[Eithne Th\u00e1ebfhota]] <ref>[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095745694 \"Eithne Th\u00e1ebfhota on Oxford Index\"] </ref>, daughter of Cathair M\u00f3r, died, another fairy woman, [[B\u00e9 Chuille]], was banished by the [[Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann]] to Ireland. She had fallen in love with Art from a distance and sought him out in her [[currach]], but when she met Conn and learned he was without a wife, agreed to marry him instead, on the condition that Art be banished from Tara for a year. The men of Ireland thought this unjust, and Ireland was barren during that year. The druids discovered that this was B\u00e9 Chuille's fault, and declared that the famine could be ended by the sacrifice of the son of a sinless couple in front of Tara. Conn went in search of this boy in B\u00e9 Chuille's currach. He landed on a strange island of apple-trees. The queen of the island had a young son, the result of her only sexual union. Conn told her that Ireland would be saved if the boy bathed in the water of Ireland, and she agreed. He took him back to Ireland, but when the druids demanded his death, he, Art and Fionn mac Cumhaill swore to protect him. Just then, a woman driving a cow carrying two bags approached, and the cow was sacrificed instead of the boy. The bags were opened: one contained a bird with one leg, the other a bird with twelve legs. The two birds fought, and the one-legged bird won.

A [[druid]] explains the meaning of the stone, and says the number of cries the stone made is the number of kings who will follow Conn, but he is not the man to name them. A magical mist arises, and a horseman approaches who throws three spears towards Conn, then asks him and the druid to follow him to his house, which stands on a plain by a golden tree. They enter, and are welcomed by a woman in a gold crown. First they see a silver vat, bound with gold hoops, full of red ale, and a golden cup and serving spoon. Then they see a phantom, a tall beautiful man, on a throne, who introduces himself as [[Lugh]].

The two kings fled to Conn, and married his daughters, Saraid and Sadb respectively. Mug Neit made war on Conn, but was defeated and killed after two battles in [[County Offaly]]. Mug Nuadat led his father's forces in retreat through Munster, fighting Conn to a standstill before escaping by sea to Beare Island (in Irish, ''Oil\u00e9an B\u00e9arra,'' now called [[Bere Island]]), and thence to Spain. Conn restored Conaire and Mac Niad to their kingdoms and withdrew.\n\nNine years later, Mug Nuadat, who had married the daughter of the king of Spain, landed with an army near [[Bantry Bay]] and forced Conaire and Mac Niad to submit to his overlordship. With the kings of Ulster and Leinster, he marched north to Mag nAi and forced Conn to make a treaty with him, dividing Ireland between them: Conn controlling the north, or ''[[Leath Cuinn|Leth Cuinn]]'' (\"Conn's half\"), and Mug Nuadat the south, or ''Leth Moga'' (\"Mug's half\"), with the border lying between [[Galway]] in the west and [[Dublin]] in the east.\n\nAfter fifteen years of peace Mug Nuadat broke the treaty and declared war, along with the kings of Ulster and Leinster. He led his army to Mag Leana, near [[Tullamore]], County Offaly. Conn retreated to Connacht, gathered his forces, and retook [[Kingdom of Mide|Meath]] from the king of Ulster. He then marched south to Mag Leana and destroyed Mug Nuadat's army in a surprise night attack on his camp. Mug Nuadat was killed in the fighting, and Conn became king of all of Ireland.<ref>[[Eugene O'Curry]] (ed. & trans.)

In his account Mug Nuadat obtains an army from the king of Leinster and expels the kings of Munster, here Lugaid Allathach, D\u00e1ire Dornmhor and Aonghus. Aonghus flees to Conn, who gives him an army with which to reclaim his kingdom, but Mug Nuadat defeats this and a further nine attempts by Conn to drive him out of Munster, forcing Conn to divide Ireland with him. When hostilities break out again, Conn and Mug Nuadat's armies gather for battle at Mag Leana, but Conn kills Mug Nuadat in his bed in an early morning attack.<ref>[[Geoffrey Keating]], ''Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn'' [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100054/text050.html 1.40]</ref>\n\nAccording to a medieval source, the hero [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] was born in Conn's time. His father, [[Cumhall]], a warrior in Conn's service, was a suitor of [[Muirne]], daughter of the druid [[Tadg mac Nuadat]], but Tadg refused his suit, so Cumhall abducted her. Conn went to war against him, and Cumhall was killed by [[Goll mac Morna]] in the Battle of Cnucha. But Muirne was already pregnant, and Tadg rejected her, ordering her to be burned. She fled to Conn, and Conn put her under the protection of Cumhall's brother-in-law Fiacal mac Conchinn. It was in Fiacal's house that she gave birth to a son, Deimne, who was later renamed Fionn.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/f01.html \"The Cause of the Battle of Cnucha\"], [[Tom Peete Cross]] & Clark Harris Slover (eds.), ''Ancient Irish Tales'', Henry Holt & Co, 1936, pp. 357\u2013359</ref> When he was ten, Fionn came to Tara put himself into Conn's service. He learned that every year at [[Samhain]], the monster [[Aillen]] would put everyone at Tara to sleep with his music, and burn down the palace with his fiery breath. Fionn killed Aillen, having kept himself awake by pressing the head of his spear to his forehead, and warded off Aillen's flame with his magical cloak, and Conn made him head of the ''[[fianna]]'' in place of Goll.<ref>Standish James O'Grady (trans.), ''[http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/colloquy_ogrady.pdf The Colloquy with the Ancients]'', In Parentheses Publications, pp. 46\u201348</ref>\n\n===Family===\nConn had two sons, [[Connla the Ruddy|Connla]] and [[Art mac Cuinn|Art]]. Connla fell in love with a fairy woman from [[Mag Mell]], and went with her to her otherworld home in her crystal boat, leaving Art alone. After that Art was known as ''\u00d3enfer'' \u2013 the \"lone\" or \"solitary\".<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/connla.html \"The Adventures of Connla the Fair\"], Cross & Slover 1936, pp. 488\u2013490</ref> Connla's tale is told in the ''[[Echtra Condla]]''.\n\nAfter Conn's wife [[Eithne Th\u00e1ebfhota]] <ref>[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095745694 \"Eithne Th\u00e1ebfhota on Oxford Index\"] </ref>, daughter of Cathair M\u00f3r, died, another fairy woman, [[B\u00e9 Chuille]], was banished by the [[Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann]] to Ireland. She had fallen in love with Art from a distance and sought him out in her [[currach]], but when she met Conn and learned he was without a wife, agreed to marry him instead, on the condition that Art be banished from Tara for a year. The men of Ireland thought this unjust, and Ireland was barren during that year. The druids discovered that this was B\u00e9 Chuille's fault, and declared that the famine could be ended by the sacrifice of the son of a sinless couple in front of Tara. Conn went in search of this boy in B\u00e9 Chuille's currach. He landed on a strange island of apple-trees. The queen of the island had a young son, the result of her only sexual union. Conn told her that Ireland would be saved if the boy bathed in the water of Ireland, and she agreed. He took him back to Ireland, but when the druids demanded his death, he, Art and Fionn mac Cumhaill swore to protect him. Just then, a woman driving a cow carrying two bags approached, and the cow was sacrificed instead of the boy. The bags were opened: one contained a bird with one leg, the other a bird with twelve legs. The two birds fought, and the one-legged bird won. The woman said the twelve-legged bird represented the druids, and the one-legged bird the boy, and revealed herself as his mother. She told Conn that the famine would end if he would put B\u00e9 Chuille away, but he refused. B\u00e9 Chuille was later banished from Tara as the result of a series of challenges she and Art made each other over a game of ''[[fidchell]]''.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/art.html \"The Adventures of Art son of Conn\"], Cross & Slover 1936, pp. 491\u2013502</ref>\n\n===Death===\n\nConn was eventually killed by [[Tipraite T\u00edrech]], king of the [[Ulaid]].

From a variety of sites that were offered, Shrum recommended to the provincial government that the summit of Burnaby Mountain, 365 meters above sea level, be chosen for the new university. Architects [[Arthur Erickson]] and Geoffrey Massey won a competition to design the university, and construction began in the spring of 1964. The campus faces northwest over Burrard Inlet. Eighteen months later, on September 9, 1965, the university began its first semester<ref name=\"Pound 2005\"/> with 2,500 students.\n\n===Early activism===\nThe campus was noted in the 1960s and early 1970s as a hotbed of political activism, culminating in a crisis in the Department of Political Science, Sociology, and Anthropology in a dispute involving ideological differences among faculty. The resolution to the crisis included the dismantling of the department into today's separate departments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peak.sfu.ca/gopher/94-3/issue4/another.ans |title=Peak.sfu.ca |accessdate=2011-02-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050901103558/http://www.peak.sfu.ca/gopher/94-3/issue4/another.ans |archivedate=September 1, 2005}}</ref> During this time, [[Thelma Finlayson]] became the University's first female faculty member in the Department of Biological Sciences.

The campus also appeared in the 1989 movie ''[[American Boyfriends]]'', set in 1965, with the buildings dressed to look like they were still under construction. The campus served as a high-tech corporate setting in the film ''[[Antitrust (film)|Antitrust]]''. Recently, in addition to other [[Vancouver]]-area landmarks, many parts of the Burnaby campus were used for the filming of the movie ''[[The 6th Day]]'' as well as ''[[Agent Cody Banks]]''. The 2007 film ''[[Personal Effects (2008 film)|Personal Effects]]'', was filmed in the newly constructed Blusson Hall at the Burnaby campus. In early 2008, the Burnaby campus was again used for filming, this time for ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008 film)|The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' (2008 Remake). Filming of the 2012 movie ''[[Underworld: Awakening]]'' starring Kate Beckinsale, began in early 2011 with parts of the AQ modified as part of the set. The SFU Surrey Campus has also been featured in blockbuster movies such as ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'', ''[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]'', and ''[[Catwoman (film)|Catwoman]]''. SFU was also the film location for ''[[Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn]]'', representing the Corbulo Academy of Military Science.\n\n===In television===\nThe Burnaby campus has been prominently featured in science fiction television series such as ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', and ''[[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]''. The Academic Quadrangle has also served as a backdrop for shots of \"FBI headquarters\" in the television series ''[[The X-Files]]'', as well as the \"National Academy For Seers\" in  ''[[Sliders]]''. Exterior shots of the Academic Quadrangle have also been used in the Vancouver-based TV series ''[[JPod (TV series)|JPod]]'' (based on the book).

From a variety of sites that were offered, Shrum recommended to the provincial government that the summit of Burnaby Mountain, 365 meters above sea level, be chosen for the new university. Architects [[Arthur Erickson]] and Geoffrey Massey won a competition to design the university, and construction began in the spring of 1964. The campus faces northwest over Burrard Inlet. Eighteen months later, on September 9, 1965, the university began its first semester<ref name=\"Pound 2005\"/> with 2,500 students.\n\n===Early activism===\nThe campus was noted in the 1960s and early 1970s as a hotbed of political activism, culminating in a crisis in the Department of Political Science, Sociology, and Anthropology in a dispute involving ideological differences among faculty. The resolution to the crisis included the dismantling of the department into today's separate departments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peak.sfu.ca/gopher/94-3/issue4/another.ans |title=Peak.sfu.ca |accessdate=2011-02-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050901103558/http://www.peak.sfu.ca/gopher/94-3/issue4/another.ans |archivedate=September 1, 2005}}</ref> During this time, [[Thelma Finlayson]] became the University's first female faculty member in the Department of Biological Sciences.

It was the first urban university classroom in British Columbia. A significant portion of funding for the building of the campus came from the private sector. The Vancouver campus has four buildings spread across the downtown core: SFU [[Harbour Centre]], the Morris J. Wosk Centre for Dialogue, the [[SFU Business|Segal Graduate School of Business]] and SFU Contemporary Arts at the restored [[Woodward's Building]]. The original campus building at Harbour Centre, a rebuilt heritage department store, officially opened on May 5, 1989. Today, the entire campus serves more than 70,000 people annually. Approximately 10,000 are graduate and undergraduate students enrolled in courses and degree programs based downtown.  The Belzberg Library<ref>[http://www.lib.sfu.ca/about/branches-depts/belzberg Belzberg Library]</ref> is based at the Vancouver campus. <!--[[File:Woodwards sfu.jpg|thumb|right|SFU Woodwards, home to the School of Contemporary Arts]]-->\n\nIn September 2010, SFU Contemporary Arts relocated to the historic Woodward's district in downtown Vancouver known as the Goldcorp Centre for the Arts. The {{convert|130,000|sqft|m2|0|adj=on}} SFU facility is part of the [[Woodward's]] revitalization project. The new facility accommodates the increasing enrollment of students in the programme and new cultural facilities, including the Fei and Milton Wong Experimental theatre, screening rooms, sound studios, and art galleries.\n\n==Student life and athletics==\n\n===Student life===\nThe student newspaper ''[[The Peak (newspaper)|The Peak]]'' was established shortly after the university opened and is circulated throughout the University.

It was then followed by ''[[The Fly II]]'', which has scenes shot inside and outside the Burnaby campus. The campus also appeared in the 1989 movie ''[[American Boyfriends]]'', set in 1965, with the buildings dressed to look like they were still under construction. The campus served as a high-tech corporate setting in the film ''[[Antitrust (film)|Antitrust]]''. Recently, in addition to other [[Vancouver]]-area landmarks, many parts of the Burnaby campus were used for the filming of the movie ''[[The 6th Day]]'' as well as ''[[Agent Cody Banks]]''. The 2007 film ''[[Personal Effects (2008 film)|Personal Effects]]'', was filmed in the newly constructed Blusson Hall at the Burnaby campus. In early 2008, the Burnaby campus was again used for filming, this time for ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008 film)|The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' (2008 Remake). Filming of the 2012 movie ''[[Underworld: Awakening]]'' starring Kate Beckinsale, began in early 2011 with parts of the AQ modified as part of the set. The SFU Surrey Campus has also been featured in blockbuster movies such as ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'', ''[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]'', and ''[[Catwoman (film)|Catwoman]]''. SFU was also the film location for ''[[Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn]]'', representing the Corbulo Academy of Military Science.\n\n===In television===\nThe Burnaby campus has been prominently featured in science fiction television series such as ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', and ''[[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]''. The Academic Quadrangle has also served as a backdrop for shots of \"FBI headquarters\" in the television series ''[[The X-Files]]'', as well as the \"National Academy For Seers\" in  ''[[Sliders]]''. Exterior shots of the Academic Quadrangle have also been used in the Vancouver-based TV series ''[[JPod (TV series)|JPod]]'' (based on the book). The SFU Surrey campus has been featured in several episodes of ''[[Smallville]]'' and ''[[Caprica (TV series)|Caprica]]'', with the entire mezzanine and registration area being transformed into the Caprica Inter-colonial Space Port.

Younger speakers, however, employ  (apico-)alveolar-stop articulations as in English {{IPA|[t]}}, {{IPA|[t\u02b0]}}, {{IPA|[t\u02bc]}}, {{IPA|[d]}} .\n* The lateral {{IPA|/t\u026c/}} is usually a fricative {{IPA|[\u026c]}} but occasionally an affricate among McCloud speakers while Trinity speakers have only the affricate. It is interdental after non-low front vowels {{IPA|/i, e/}}, post-dental after low {{IPA|/a/}}, and retroflex after non-low back {{IPA|/u, o/}}.\n* In the speech of older speakers, postalveolar {{IPA|/\u0283/}} is retroflex {{IPA|[\u0282]}} adjacent to back vowels {{IPA|/u, o, a/}}.\n* Velars {{IPA|/k, k\u02bc, x/}} are advanced before non-low front vowels {{IPA|/i, e/}} and retracted before non-low back vowels {{IPA|/u, o/}}. In the manner of articulation, velars and post-velars can be glottalized and non-glottalized (voiceless).\n* The trill {{IPA|/\u027dr/}} is apico-postalveolar retroflex. It is occurs as a flap {{IPA|[\u027d]}} between vowels.\n* The glottal stop {{IPA|/\u0294/}} is weakly articulated except when the speaker is being deliberate or emphatic. It is always fully articulated in word-final position.\n\n===Vowels===\nWintu has 10 (or 11) [[vowel]]s:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=2 | &nbsp;\n! colspan=2 | &nbsp;[[Vowel length|Short]]&nbsp;\n! colspan=2 | &nbsp;[[Vowel length|Long]]&nbsp;\n|-\n! &nbsp;[[Front vowel|Front]]&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;[[Back vowel|Back]]&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;Front&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;Back&nbsp;\n|-\n| &nbsp;'''[[High vowel|High]] (close)'''&nbsp;\n| align=center | {{IPA|i}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|u}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|i\u02d0}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|u\u02d0}}\n|-\n| &nbsp;'''[[Mid vowel|Mid]]'''&nbsp;\n| align=center | {{IPA|e}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|o}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|e\u02d0}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|o\u02d0}}\n|-\n| &nbsp;'''[[Low vowel|Low]] (open)'''&nbsp;\n| colspan=2 align=center | {{IPA|a}}\n| colspan=2 align=center | {{IPA|a\u02d0}}\n|-\n|&nbsp;'''Anomalous '''&nbsp;\n| align=center | {{IPA|\u00e6}}\n|}\n* Wintu has short and long vowels.\n* {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} is a phoneme that only occurs in borrowed English words.\n* All vowels are slightly [[Rhinoglottophilia|nasalized before the glottal consonant]] {{IPA|/\u0294/}}\n* All vowels are voiced and oral (except for the above-mentioned nasal allophones).\n\n===Syllable structure===\n\nSegmental phonemes require obligatorily a single onset consonant. The rhyme is usually composed of a vowel nucleus of a long or a short vowel optionally followed by a single consonant. The syllabic canon is\n\n: {{IPA|CV(\u02d0)(C)}}.\n\nSome examples of a generic syllable structure are:\n\n: {{IPA|CV}}   {{IPA|[qa]}}=and, or.\n: {{IPA|CV\u02d0}}  {{IPA|[mi\u02d0]}}=tree\n: {{IPA|CVC}}  {{IPA|[nuq]}}=pus\n: {{IPA|CV\u02d0C}} {{IPA|[ba\u02d0s]}}=food.\n\nConsonant clusters result only from conjoined closed syllables. For example, clusters of consonants occur when a syllable ending in a consonant is followed in the same word by another syllable.\nSome examples of consonant clusters are:\n\n: {{IPA|CVC.CVC}}  {{IPA|[pot.xom]}}=poison oak.\n: {{IPA|CVC.CV\u02d0C}} {{IPA|[net.ta\u02d0n]}}=my father.\n: {{IPA|CVC.CVC}} {{IPA|[\u0294el.\u0294ih]}}=you put it in.\n\nVowels may be long, but sequences of vowels do not occur.\n\n===Stress===\n'''Syllable stress''' in Wintu are predictable components of two junctures hyphen/-/ and plus/+/.\nThere are four phonemic junctures ranked by their magnitude: Plus/+/, hyphen/-/, comma/,/ and period/./.\n* '''Plus juncture''' is a central juncture. In Plus Juncture the location of the  pitch and the stress in a phonemic word is determined by the structure of the syllable and its position relative to the juncture.\nSyllables are determined by the presence or absence of vowels and semi-vowels. Light syllables contain short vowels. Heavy syllables contain short vowels followed by a semi-vowel. Extra-heavy syllables contain long vowels. The prominent syllable of a phonemic word is always the first, unless the second syllable is heavier, in which case the second syllable is stressed.\n* '''Degree of intensity'''\nIn the primary stress the greater is the magnitude of the preceding juncture, the greater is the intensity of the stress.\nThe secondary stress, on the other hand, occurs when a heavy syllable follows the prominent syllable and varies in intensity.\nThe weakest stress occurs when a syllable is not stressed and follows immediately after a phonemic juncture.\n\n:    Ex. Extra heavy syllable: b'''\u00f3'''\ua78fs= house.\n:    Ex. Syllable with secondary stress: n'''\u00ed'''= I.\n:    Ex. Light Syllable: L'''i'''l\u00e1\ua78f=to accuse.\n* '''The Hyphen Juncture''' occurs with phonemic words and it represents a phonemically functional unity with particular phonetic proprieties that contrast with other junctures.\nLike the plus juncture, the hyphen juncture affects the location of higher pitch and stress. But instead of conditioning the location of the syllables like the plus juncture, the hyphen shifts the pitch and the stress. The Hyphen juncture is the juncture with the least magnitude, being the only one occurring within words (for example, following certain prefixes and preceding some auxiliaries and enclitics).\n\n:    Ex./+ma\ua78ftceki+/ ear wax.\n:    Ex./+ma\ua78ft'''-'''ceki'''-'''/one split ear.\n:    Ex./+\u0294elwine+/ with, along, accompanying.\n:    Ex./+\u0294el'''-'''wine'''-'''/ to look straight in the eye.\n* '''Comma juncture'''/,/\nIt has two phonetic features: a fully realised pause accompanied or preceded by glottal stricture.\n* '''Period Juncture'''/./\nIt is the juncture with the greatest magnitude and it has four phonetic features:\n* A fully realised pause\n* An associated glottal structure\n* A preceding phrasal accent of unpredictable location\n* A terminal pitch contour that drops sharply in pitch level and voicing\n\nPeriod juncture delimits phonemic sentences.\n\n:    Ex. ba\ua78f-s-bo\ua78fsin+ net, nis+\u03bbiya. They threw rocks at me because I was eating.\n:    Ex. ba\ua78fs-bo\ua78fsin+ mat, mis+ \u03bbiya. They threw rocks at you because you were eating.\n* '''Phrasal Accent'''\nIt consists of very high pitch and particularly heavy stress.\n\n:    Ex. Sukuyum+ l\u00edmcada.=my dog is sick.\n:    EX.

It is in a frontal position before /i/ and /e/ and becomes backed with all the other vowels.\n* Among the stop consonants only /p/, /t/, and /k/ occur finally as well as initially.\n* The labiodental /f/ is an anomalous phoneme and it occurs only in two borrowed forms /fori\u0134ulay/, Fourth of July or in /friho\ua78f  lis/ beans.\n* Older speakers pronounce /s/ as /\u1e63/, a retroflexed post-alveolar slit before or after /a/, /o/ and /u/ while younger speakers use /s/ everywhere.\n* /h/ becomes a glottal spirant before /u/, /o/ and /a/, as in /ha\ua78fsma/, to keep on yawning.\n* /r/ is a voiced trill but when it occurs between vowels it becomes a voiced flap, as for example /yor/ tear (imperative form) and /yura/ to tear (infinitive form).\n* /l/ a lateral apical-alveolar, is sometime confused with /r/ as in the word /lileter/ a corn meal.\n\n===Morphology===\nWintu possesses a sophisticated morphology with some polysynthetic characteristics. The combination of its morphemes into words involves several processes such as suffixation, prefixation, compounding, reduplication and consonant and vocalic ablaut.\nNevertheless, the most common process is suffixation, which occurs primarily in verbs.\n\n===Vowel ablaut===\nThe '''Vowel Ablaut''' is a change in the height (gradation) of  the root-syllable vowels and it affects the vowel quantity.\nIn Wintu, the vowel ablaut occurs only in the mutations of some verb-root vowels (called dissimilation), or in some root-deriving suffixes (assimilation).\nRoot-vowel dissimilation is conditioned by the height of the vowel in the following syllable, while the suffix vowel assimilation is conditioned by the quantity of the vowel in the preceding syllable.\nAn example of dissimilation takes place when /e/ and /o/, which occurs only in root syllables, are raised in height when they are preceded by a single consonant and followed by the low vowel /a/ in the next syllable.\n\nEx.  lEla-/lila/ \"to transform\" and lElu-/lelu/ \"transform\".\n\nAn example of dissimilation takes place when the morphophoneme [V]assimilates completely to the quality of the  vowel that precedes  in the previous syllable.\n\nEx.cewVlVlVha=/ceweleleha/ \"many to be wide open\".\n\n===Consonant ablaut===\nA small amount of consonant ablaut is also present in Wintu, for example before word juncture /c\u02bc/ and /b/ change in /p/.\n\n===Nouns===\nSubstantives  are marked for aspect and case.\nThere are two different types of substantives: those formed directly from roots (pronouns, non possessed nouns, kinship terms) and those based on forms of complex derivation from radical and stems (mostly nouns).\nPronouns can be singular, dual, and plural. They have particular suffixes (possessive for instrumental functions and for marking plural humans.) They are also very similar to verbs.\nNouns have  a variety of roots, they are an open class, they may show number in rare forms and  they do not distinguish possessive from instrumental functions. Nouns can be classified in possessed and non possessed.\nThe noun is composed of two elements:a stem and a suffix. The stem is usually a root. The suffixes specify numbers, animateness, personification or individuation.\nSome nouns  have the same stem but have a different generic and particular meaning.\nEx. /tu/ (particular aspect) eye; (generic aspect) face(s).\nThe suffixes of the nouns can also have different cases: object [um](sedem-coyote), genitive[un](seden), locative [in], instrumental [r], possessive[t], emphatic possessive (reduplication of the last syllable).\n\n===Verbs===\nVerbs are the wider class of words in Wintu. Also several nouns derivate from verbs. The category of verbs has a very sophisticated morphological structure.\nPitkin (1964) identifies three stem forms: indicative, imperative and nominal.\n* '''Prefixes''': optional in occurrence, when affixed directly to roots are followed by a hyphen juncture.\n* '''Roots''': the most part are monosyllabic and with the shape CVC or CV\ua78fC. Two important processes are root derivation and  reduplication.\n* '''Suffixes'''\n** Root-deriving suffixes (suffixes added to the root): distributive, repetitive, iterative, transitive, stative, privative.\n** Stem suffixes (added to the stem form):\n** '''Imperative Stem Suffixation'''\n** 1 position class derivation class=patient suffix, comitative suffix, generic comitative suffix\n** 2 position class: reflexive\n** 3 position class: causative\n** 4 position class: reciprocal, benefactive\n** 1 position class inflectional suffixes=warning, passive\n** 2 position class.

A morphological word  is the basic syntactical unit. In some cases a morphological word that is phonemically a single word can be syntactically two different words.\nA '''morphological word''',can be '''clitic''' or '''non clitic'''. The clitic word, is always dependent on the non-clitic. The clitic words can be proclitic and postclitic depending on their position. Some morphemic words can be both clitics and full words.\nFor example: the morphemic word / \u0294el/, in, is both a full word in /qewel\u0294el/, in the house, and a proclitic in /\u0294el-qewel/, which have the same meaning.\nThe largest syntactic unit is the '''sentence'''. Sentences are considered a sequences of full words terminated by a period juncture /./. The sentence can be considered a '''clause''' if it contains verbs, sentence if it contains nouns. Sentences never contains main verbs.\nClauses can be dependent or independent. This depends on the kind of suffix who forms the verb. Independent verbs take the personal inflectional suffixes while dependent verbs are characterised by the subordinating suffixes{r},{tan},{\u0294a], {n},}{so}, and {ta}.\nIn the sentences the syntactic relationships between full words and clitics are indicated by the word order and by the inflectional and derivational suffixes.\nFour types of functions can be distinguished for the sentences: '''head''', '''attributive''', '''satellite''', and '''conjunction'''.\nThe head is usually a noun and it is not dependent on other forms as for example /winthu/Wintu people. The attributive preceded  and modify the head as for example in /winthu\ua78fn qewelin/ in a Wintu house.\nOn the other hand, the satellite only occurs in clauses. A satellite could be either the subject or the object of a verb. If the satellite is the subject of the verb, it precedes the verb, as for example /po\ua78f m yel-hura/land destroyed, but if the satellite is the object and it is in a dependent clause or a noun-phrase containing a genitive attributive, follows.\nFor example: /sedet \u0294elew'kiyemti\ua78fn/ coyote never speaks wisely, or /wayda me\ua78fm hina/ a northern flood of water (will) arrive.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Wintuan languages]]\n* [[Wintu]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.winnememwintu.us/language-preservation/ \"Beedi Yalumina\" (Don't Give Up!): The Winnemem Wintu Language Project]\n* [http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~survey/languages/wintu.php Wintu language] overview at the [[Survey of California and Other Indian Languages]]\n* [http://www.native-languages.org/wintu.htm Wintu Language] at nativeamerican.org\n* [http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~survey/languages/wintu.php Wintu at the Survey of California and Other Indian Languages]\n* [http://www.language-archives.org/language/wit OLAC resources in and about the Wintu language]\n* [http://wintu-sprache-retten.blogspot.com/ Wintu Language site] (in German)\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Golla, Victor (2011).

In other speakers, it has merged with {{IPA|/t\u026c/}}.\n* Dental stops are denti-alveolar: {{IPA|[d\u032a]}}, {{IPA|[t\u032a]}}, {{IPA|[t\u032a\u02b0]}}, {{IPA|[t\u032a\u02bc]}}. Younger speakers, however, employ  (apico-)alveolar-stop articulations as in English {{IPA|[t]}}, {{IPA|[t\u02b0]}}, {{IPA|[t\u02bc]}}, {{IPA|[d]}} .\n* The lateral {{IPA|/t\u026c/}} is usually a fricative {{IPA|[\u026c]}} but occasionally an affricate among McCloud speakers while Trinity speakers have only the affricate. It is interdental after non-low front vowels {{IPA|/i, e/}}, post-dental after low {{IPA|/a/}}, and retroflex after non-low back {{IPA|/u, o/}}.\n* In the speech of older speakers, postalveolar {{IPA|/\u0283/}} is retroflex {{IPA|[\u0282]}} adjacent to back vowels {{IPA|/u, o, a/}}.\n* Velars {{IPA|/k, k\u02bc, x/}} are advanced before non-low front vowels {{IPA|/i, e/}} and retracted before non-low back vowels {{IPA|/u, o/}}. In the manner of articulation, velars and post-velars can be glottalized and non-glottalized (voiceless).\n* The trill {{IPA|/\u027dr/}} is apico-postalveolar retroflex. It is occurs as a flap {{IPA|[\u027d]}} between vowels.\n* The glottal stop {{IPA|/\u0294/}} is weakly articulated except when the speaker is being deliberate or emphatic. It is always fully articulated in word-final position.\n\n===Vowels===\nWintu has 10 (or 11) [[vowel]]s:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=2 | &nbsp;\n! colspan=2 | &nbsp;[[Vowel length|Short]]&nbsp;\n! colspan=2 | &nbsp;[[Vowel length|Long]]&nbsp;\n|-\n! &nbsp;[[Front vowel|Front]]&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;[[Back vowel|Back]]&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;Front&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;Back&nbsp;\n|-\n| &nbsp;'''[[High vowel|High]] (close)'''&nbsp;\n| align=center | {{IPA|i}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|u}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|i\u02d0}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|u\u02d0}}\n|-\n| &nbsp;'''[[Mid vowel|Mid]]'''&nbsp;\n| align=center | {{IPA|e}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|o}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|e\u02d0}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|o\u02d0}}\n|-\n| &nbsp;'''[[Low vowel|Low]] (open)'''&nbsp;\n| colspan=2 align=center | {{IPA|a}}\n| colspan=2 align=center | {{IPA|a\u02d0}}\n|-\n|&nbsp;'''Anomalous '''&nbsp;\n| align=center | {{IPA|\u00e6}}\n|}\n* Wintu has short and long vowels.\n* {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} is a phoneme that only occurs in borrowed English words.\n* All vowels are slightly [[Rhinoglottophilia|nasalized before the glottal consonant]] {{IPA|/\u0294/}}\n* All vowels are voiced and oral (except for the above-mentioned nasal allophones).\n\n===Syllable structure===\n\nSegmental phonemes require obligatorily a single onset consonant. The rhyme is usually composed of a vowel nucleus of a long or a short vowel optionally followed by a single consonant. The syllabic canon is\n\n: {{IPA|CV(\u02d0)(C)}}.\n\nSome examples of a generic syllable structure are:\n\n: {{IPA|CV}}   {{IPA|[qa]}}=and, or.\n: {{IPA|CV\u02d0}}  {{IPA|[mi\u02d0]}}=tree\n: {{IPA|CVC}}  {{IPA|[nuq]}}=pus\n: {{IPA|CV\u02d0C}} {{IPA|[ba\u02d0s]}}=food.\n\nConsonant clusters result only from conjoined closed syllables. For example, clusters of consonants occur when a syllable ending in a consonant is followed in the same word by another syllable.\nSome examples of consonant clusters are:\n\n: {{IPA|CVC.CVC}}  {{IPA|[pot.xom]}}=poison oak.\n: {{IPA|CVC.CV\u02d0C}} {{IPA|[net.ta\u02d0n]}}=my father.\n: {{IPA|CVC.CVC}} {{IPA|[\u0294el.\u0294ih]}}=you put it in.\n\nVowels may be long, but sequences of vowels do not occur.\n\n===Stress===\n'''Syllable stress''' in Wintu are predictable components of two junctures hyphen/-/ and plus/+/.\nThere are four phonemic junctures ranked by their magnitude: Plus/+/, hyphen/-/, comma/,/ and period/./.\n* '''Plus juncture''' is a central juncture. In Plus Juncture the location of the  pitch and the stress in a phonemic word is determined by the structure of the syllable and its position relative to the juncture.\nSyllables are determined by the presence or absence of vowels and semi-vowels. Light syllables contain short vowels. Heavy syllables contain short vowels followed by a semi-vowel. Extra-heavy syllables contain long vowels. The prominent syllable of a phonemic word is always the first, unless the second syllable is heavier, in which case the second syllable is stressed.\n* '''Degree of intensity'''\nIn the primary stress the greater is the magnitude of the preceding juncture, the greater is the intensity of the stress.\nThe secondary stress, on the other hand, occurs when a heavy syllable follows the prominent syllable and varies in intensity.\nThe weakest stress occurs when a syllable is not stressed and follows immediately after a phonemic juncture.\n\n:    Ex. Extra heavy syllable: b'''\u00f3'''\ua78fs= house.\n:    Ex. Syllable with secondary stress: n'''\u00ed'''= I.\n:    Ex. Light Syllable: L'''i'''l\u00e1\ua78f=to accuse.\n* '''The Hyphen Juncture''' occurs with phonemic words and it represents a phonemically functional unity with particular phonetic proprieties that contrast with other junctures.\nLike the plus juncture, the hyphen juncture affects the location of higher pitch and stress. But instead of conditioning the location of the syllables like the plus juncture, the hyphen shifts the pitch and the stress. The Hyphen juncture is the juncture with the least magnitude, being the only one occurring within words (for example, following certain prefixes and preceding some auxiliaries and enclitics).\n\n:    Ex./+ma\ua78ftceki+/ ear wax.\n:    Ex./+ma\ua78ft'''-'''ceki'''-'''/one split ear.\n:    Ex./+\u0294elwine+/ with, along, accompanying.\n:    Ex./+\u0294el'''-'''wine'''-'''/ to look straight in the eye.\n* '''Comma juncture'''/,/\nIt has two phonetic features: a fully realised pause accompanied or preceded by glottal stricture.\n* '''Period Juncture'''/./\nIt is the juncture with the greatest magnitude and it has four phonetic features:\n* A fully realised pause\n* An associated glottal structure\n* A preceding phrasal accent of unpredictable location\n* A terminal pitch contour that drops sharply in pitch level and voicing\n\nPeriod juncture delimits phonemic sentences.\n\n:    Ex. ba\ua78f-s-bo\ua78fsin+ net, nis+\u03bbiya. They threw rocks at me because I was eating.\n:    Ex. ba\ua78fs-bo\ua78fsin+ mat, mis+ \u03bbiya. They threw rocks at you because you were eating.\n* '''Phrasal Accent'''\nIt consists of very high pitch and particularly heavy stress.\n\n:    Ex. Sukuyum+ l\u00edmcada.=my dog is sick.\n:    EX. S'''\u00fa'''kuyum+ l\u00edmcada.=my dog is sick.\n\n===Phonological processes===\nA vast number of phonological processes occur in the Wintu language.\n* The glottalized velars are pronounced with a slight friction of the tongue when they are in contact with certain vowels in particular contexts.\nFor example, /k'/ becomes prevelar before /i/ and /e/ but it is velar before /\u0294a/ and it is backed before /u/ and /o/.\nIn a similar way, the glottalized velar /q'/ is pronounced with more friction at the point of articulation as /q'\u02e3/. It is in a frontal position before /i/ and /e/ and becomes backed with all the other vowels.\n* Among the stop consonants only /p/, /t/, and /k/ occur finally as well as initially.\n* The labiodental /f/ is an anomalous phoneme and it occurs only in two borrowed forms /fori\u0134ulay/, Fourth of July or in /friho\ua78f  lis/ beans.\n* Older speakers pronounce /s/ as /\u1e63/, a retroflexed post-alveolar slit before or after /a/, /o/ and /u/ while younger speakers use /s/ everywhere.\n* /h/ becomes a glottal spirant before /u/, /o/ and /a/, as in /ha\ua78fsma/, to keep on yawning.\n* /r/ is a voiced trill but when it occurs between vowels it becomes a voiced flap, as for example /yor/ tear (imperative form) and /yura/ to tear (infinitive form).\n* /l/ a lateral apical-alveolar, is sometime confused with /r/ as in the word /lileter/ a corn meal.\n\n===Morphology===\nWintu possesses a sophisticated morphology with some polysynthetic characteristics. The combination of its morphemes into words involves several processes such as suffixation, prefixation, compounding, reduplication and consonant and vocalic ablaut.\nNevertheless, the most common process is suffixation, which occurs primarily in verbs.\n\n===Vowel ablaut===\nThe '''Vowel Ablaut''' is a change in the height (gradation) of  the root-syllable vowels and it affects the vowel quantity.\nIn Wintu, the vowel ablaut occurs only in the mutations of some verb-root vowels (called dissimilation), or in some root-deriving suffixes (assimilation).\nRoot-vowel dissimilation is conditioned by the height of the vowel in the following syllable, while the suffix vowel assimilation is conditioned by the quantity of the vowel in the preceding syllable.\nAn example of dissimilation takes place when /e/ and /o/, which occurs only in root syllables, are raised in height when they are preceded by a single consonant and followed by the low vowel /a/ in the next syllable.\n\nEx.  lEla-/lila/ \"to transform\" and lElu-/lelu/ \"transform\".\n\nAn example of dissimilation takes place when the morphophoneme [V]assimilates completely to the quality of the  vowel that precedes  in the previous syllable.\n\nEx.cewVlVlVha=/ceweleleha/ \"many to be wide open\".\n\n===Consonant ablaut===\nA small amount of consonant ablaut is also present in Wintu, for example before word juncture /c\u02bc/ and /b/ change in /p/.\n\n===Nouns===\nSubstantives  are marked for aspect and case.\nThere are two different types of substantives: those formed directly from roots (pronouns, non possessed nouns, kinship terms) and those based on forms of complex derivation from radical and stems (mostly nouns).\nPronouns can be singular, dual, and plural. They have particular suffixes (possessive for instrumental functions and for marking plural humans.) They are also very similar to verbs.\nNouns have  a variety of roots, they are an open class, they may show number in rare forms and  they do not distinguish possessive from instrumental functions. Nouns can be classified in possessed and non possessed.\nThe noun is composed of two elements:a stem and a suffix. The stem is usually a root. The suffixes specify numbers, animateness, personification or individuation.\nSome nouns  have the same stem but have a different generic and particular meaning.\nEx. /tu/ (particular aspect) eye; (generic aspect) face(s).\nThe suffixes of the nouns can also have different cases: object [um](sedem-coyote), genitive[un](seden), locative [in], instrumental [r], possessive[t], emphatic possessive (reduplication of the last syllable).\n\n===Verbs===\nVerbs are the wider class of words in Wintu. Also several nouns derivate from verbs. The category of verbs has a very sophisticated morphological structure.\nPitkin (1964) identifies three stem forms: indicative, imperative and nominal.\n* '''Prefixes''': optional in occurrence, when affixed directly to roots are followed by a hyphen juncture.\n* '''Roots''': the most part are monosyllabic and with the shape CVC or CV\ua78fC. Two important processes are root derivation and  reduplication.\n* '''Suffixes'''\n** Root-deriving suffixes (suffixes added to the root): distributive, repetitive, iterative, transitive, stative, privative.\n** Stem suffixes (added to the stem form):\n** '''Imperative Stem Suffixation'''\n** 1 position class derivation class=patient suffix, comitative suffix, generic comitative suffix\n** 2 position class: reflexive\n** 3 position class: causative\n** 4 position class: reciprocal, benefactive\n** 1 position class inflectional suffixes=warning, passive\n** 2 position class.

A morphological word  is the basic syntactical unit. In some cases a morphological word that is phonemically a single word can be syntactically two different words.\nA '''morphological word''',can be '''clitic''' or '''non clitic'''. The clitic word, is always dependent on the non-clitic. The clitic words can be proclitic and postclitic depending on their position. Some morphemic words can be both clitics and full words.\nFor example: the morphemic word / \u0294el/, in, is both a full word in /qewel\u0294el/, in the house, and a proclitic in /\u0294el-qewel/, which have the same meaning.\nThe largest syntactic unit is the '''sentence'''. Sentences are considered a sequences of full words terminated by a period juncture /./. The sentence can be considered a '''clause''' if it contains verbs, sentence if it contains nouns. Sentences never contains main verbs.\nClauses can be dependent or independent. This depends on the kind of suffix who forms the verb. Independent verbs take the personal inflectional suffixes while dependent verbs are characterised by the subordinating suffixes{r},{tan},{\u0294a], {n},}{so}, and {ta}.\nIn the sentences the syntactic relationships between full words and clitics are indicated by the word order and by the inflectional and derivational suffixes.\nFour types of functions can be distinguished for the sentences: '''head''', '''attributive''', '''satellite''', and '''conjunction'''.\nThe head is usually a noun and it is not dependent on other forms as for example /winthu/Wintu people. The attributive preceded  and modify the head as for example in /winthu\ua78fn qewelin/ in a Wintu house.\nOn the other hand, the satellite only occurs in clauses. A satellite could be either the subject or the object of a verb. If the satellite is the subject of the verb, it precedes the verb, as for example /po\ua78f m yel-hura/land destroyed, but if the satellite is the object and it is in a dependent clause or a noun-phrase containing a genitive attributive, follows.\nFor example: /sedet \u0294elew'kiyemti\ua78fn/ coyote never speaks wisely, or /wayda me\ua78fm hina/ a northern flood of water (will) arrive.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Wintuan languages]]\n* [[Wintu]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.winnememwintu.us/language-preservation/ \"Beedi Yalumina\" (Don't Give Up!): The Winnemem Wintu Language Project]\n* [http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~survey/languages/wintu.php Wintu language] overview at the [[Survey of California and Other Indian Languages]]\n* [http://www.native-languages.org/wintu.htm Wintu Language] at nativeamerican.org\n* [http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~survey/languages/wintu.php Wintu at the Survey of California and Other Indian Languages]\n* [http://www.language-archives.org/language/wit OLAC resources in and about the Wintu language]\n* [http://wintu-sprache-retten.blogspot.com/ Wintu Language site] (in German)\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Golla, Victor (2011).

In 1920, all the buildings in the vicinity were torn down, giving way to the modern square, which was built according to the designs of the architect [[B\u00e9la Rerrich]]. The square is surrounded in a U-shape by archwayed buildings made of dark brown bricks. The buildings are shared by Szeged University, the College of Catholic Theology, the Seat of the Bishop and a university [[dormitory]]. The [[relief]]s decorating the walls were made by [[B\u00e9la Ohmann]]. After the noon chimes, a musical clock (the work of [[Ferenc Csuri]], a master watchmaker) brings models of famous University figures to life. 86 statues of prominent Szeged University figures line the walls of the archways.\n\n=== Dugonics Square ===\n[[File:J\u00f3zsef Attila-eml\u00e9kszobor (Varga Imre, 1964), Szeged-ja-1.jpg|thumb|A statue commemorating [[Attila J\u00f3zsef]] in Dugonics Square, sculpted by [[Imre Varga]] in 1964.]]\n\nThe main building of the University, built between 1872 and 1873 to the designs of [[Antal Skalnitzky]] and [[Ferenc Arleth]], was moved to Dugonics Square in 1921. Before the Great Szeged Flood of 1879, the square was home to Szeged's wheat market. A fountain, built in 1979 on the 100th anniversary of the flood by [[Istv\u00e1n Tarnai]], occupies the centre of the square. Also present is a statue commemorating the famous Hungarian poet [[Attila J\u00f3zsef]], which was sculpted by [[Imre Varga]] in 1964.

In 1920, all the buildings in the vicinity were torn down, giving way to the modern square, which was built according to the designs of the architect [[B\u00e9la Rerrich]]. The square is surrounded in a U-shape by archwayed buildings made of dark brown bricks. The buildings are shared by Szeged University, the College of Catholic Theology, the Seat of the Bishop and a university [[dormitory]]. The [[relief]]s decorating the walls were made by [[B\u00e9la Ohmann]]. After the noon chimes, a musical clock (the work of [[Ferenc Csuri]], a master watchmaker) brings models of famous University figures to life. 86 statues of prominent Szeged University figures line the walls of the archways.\n\n=== Dugonics Square ===\n[[File:J\u00f3zsef Attila-eml\u00e9kszobor (Varga Imre, 1964), Szeged-ja-1.jpg|thumb|A statue commemorating [[Attila J\u00f3zsef]] in Dugonics Square, sculpted by [[Imre Varga]] in 1964.]]\n\nThe main building of the University, built between 1872 and 1873 to the designs of [[Antal Skalnitzky]] and [[Ferenc Arleth]], was moved to Dugonics Square in 1921. Before the Great Szeged Flood of 1879, the square was home to Szeged's wheat market. A fountain, built in 1979 on the 100th anniversary of the flood by [[Istv\u00e1n Tarnai]], occupies the centre of the square. Also present is a statue commemorating the famous Hungarian poet [[Attila J\u00f3zsef]], which was sculpted by [[Imre Varga]] in 1964.
