The film stars husband and wife actors [[Patrick J. Adams]] and [[Troian Bellisario]], playing astrophysicist Isaac and itinerant artist Clara, who become close while searching for signs of intelligent life in the universe. The film is grounded in recent technological and theoretical advances, and attracted the attention of astronomers. The film received mixed reviews from critics, and out of a handful of nominations from various bodies, won an award from the [[Austin Film Festival]], \n\n==Plot==\nDr. Isaac Bruno holds a postdoctoral research fellowship in astrophysics at (fictional) Ontario University, in [[Toronto]]. His goal of finding signs of intelligent life in the universe has become an obsession, linked to an unspecified trauma in his personal life two years earlier. He has become increasingly antagonistic towards his students and has taken to misappropriating time on ground-based telescopes in Chile, intended for a colleague's research. His department head suspends him, denying him any access to the school's research facilities.\n\nThe [[Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite|TESS]] orbiting telescope is launched, providing enormous amounts of data that is shared with the world, in a community effort to analyze and find possible life on [[exoplanet]]s. Isaac posts flyers looking for an unpaid research assistant, offering nothing but room and board. His only response is from Clara, an uneducated artist who has lived a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian lifestyle]]. Clara has her own secrets, seen taking some type of medicine for an unspecified issue.\n\nIsaac focuses on results from [[Red dwarf|M dwarf]] stars, believing it to be a niche that no one else will bother with. When Clara finds a promising exoplanet, Isaac sneaks into the university in the night and lies to the telescope operators in Chile, claiming to have permission from his friend Charlie, to get more data on the planet.\n\nCharlie is furious, but also intrigued by the data results. He advises Isaac to contact Rebecca, Isaac's ex-wife, who holds an endowed chair at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]]. Clara convinces Isaac to contact Rebecca, despite his reluctance. The upheaval in their lives is finally revealed, when Rebecca tells Isaac that finding life will not bring back their dead baby son. She gets him some time on the [[W. M. Keck Observatory|Keck]] telescope. This results in proving that they have found a [[Planetary habitability|habitable planet candidate]].\n\nClara is falling in love with Isaac, but he has become jaded about love or anything else that can not be scientifically proven. She kisses him, then abruptly backs off when he starts to respond. When Charlie's wife has a baby, Isaac pontificates on how a minuscule change took his own son, and could equally change the entire universe. Clara reminds him that those same minuscule changes did result in his son existing at all. This leads to them finally becoming a couple. \n\nWhen they learn that someone else discovered \u201ctheir\u201d planet a week before them, Isaac becomes despondent. He soon decides to focus on finding direct evidence of life, rather than just a potentially habitable planet. In his obsession, he is blind to Clara's declining health, until Charlie chastises him. Isaac tells Clara it is time for him to stop his search, but she makes him ignore the data and focus on his inner connection to the universe. He is surprised when it works, but rejects it and her. She grabs her bag to leave - and collapses.\n\nAt the hospital, it is revealed that Clara has an autoimmune disease that is causing the complete breakdown of every organ and muscle in her body. The doctors are shocked that she can even walk or talk, and confirm she will soon be dead. Isaac stays at her bedside for her last few days. Moments before she dies, she tells him he is going to \u201csee it\u201d.\n\nA fresh batch of TESS data is released, and Isaac does \u201csee it\u201d - proof of a seemingly artificial object in coincident orbit with an exoplanet. He takes his findings to Charlie, who introduces him to Dr. Rickman, head of the TESS project. Two years later, at a press conference at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]], Dr. Rickman, Rebecca and Charlie explain that the data gathered now conclusively proves the existence of the artificial object, orbiting a star 200 light years distant, in turn proving the existence of intelligent alien life. Isaac is not in his assigned seat on the panel, choosing instead to spend time reminiscing about Clara.\n\nA few months later, Rebecca summons Isaac to the [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI]] laboratory. She reveals that the aliens have sent a message&mdash;\u201cIsaac Bruno\u201d. He is present when the next message arrives &ndash; an audio file of a [[Bob Dylan]] song that he and Clara often listened to together. The film ends with Isaac smiling through his tears.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Patrick J.

Its indirect action on arousal, mood and concentration contributes in large part to its cognitive enhancing properties. | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/83d636c21c00a9ffbc6e4b73503ed52aa5921d9b }}</ref> The amount of caffeine needed to produce these effects varies from person to person, depending on body size and degree of tolerance.<ref name=\"effects\" /> The desired effects arise approximately one hour after consumption, and the desired effects of a moderate dose usually subside after about three or four hours.<ref name = \"Poleszak 2015\"/>\n\nCaffeine can delay or prevent [[sleep]] and improves task performance during sleep deprivation.<ref name=\"pmid21531247\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Snel J, Lorist MM | title = Effects of caffeine on sleep and cognition | journal = Progress in Brain Research | volume = 190 | pages = 105\u201317 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21531247 | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-444-53817-8.00006-2 | isbn = 978-0-444-53817-8 }}</ref> [[Shift work]]ers who use caffeine make fewer mistakes due to drowsiness.<ref name=\"pmid20464765\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ker K, Edwards PJ, Felix LM, Blackhall K, Roberts I | title = Caffeine for the prevention of injuries and errors in shift workers | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 5 | pages = CD008508 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20464765 | pmc = 4160007 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD008508 | veditors = Ker K }}</ref>\n\nA [[systematic review]] and [[meta-analysis]] from 2014 found that concurrent caffeine and [[L-theanine|{{smallcaps all|L}}-theanine]] use has synergistic psychoactive effects that promote alertness, attention, and [[Task switching (psychology)|task switching]];<ref name=\"caffeine and theanine\" /> these effects are most pronounced during the first hour post-dose.<ref name=\"caffeine and theanine\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Camfield DA, Stough C, Farrimond J, Scholey AB | title = Acute effects of tea constituents L-theanine, caffeine, and epigallocatechin gallate on cognitive function and mood: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Nutrition Reviews | volume = 72 | issue = 8 | pages = 507\u201322 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 24946991 | doi = 10.1111/nure.12120 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8dfd8669e02a02eada698e38bed4826a787235b8 }}</ref>\n\n====Physical====\nCaffeine is a proven [[ergogenic aid]] in humans.<ref name=\"Peripheral and central ergogenic effects\" /> Caffeine improves athletic performance in [[aerobic exercise|aerobic]] (especially [[endurance sports]]) and [[anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]] conditions.<ref name=\"Peripheral and central ergogenic effects\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pesta DH, Angadi SS, Burtscher M, Roberts CK | title = The effects of caffeine, nicotine, ethanol, and tetrahydrocannabinol on exercise performance | journal = Nutrition & Metabolism | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 71 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24330705 | pmc = 3878772 | doi = 10.1186/1743-7075-10-71}} Quote: {{quote|Caffeine-induced increases in performance have been observed in aerobic as well as anaerobic sports (for reviews, see [26,30,31])...}}</ref> Moderate doses of caffeine (around 5&nbsp;mg/kg<ref name=\"Peripheral and central ergogenic effects\" />) can improve sprint performance,<ref name=\"pmid21058748\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bishop D | title = Dietary supplements and team-sport performance | journal = Sports Medicine | volume = 40 | issue = 12 | pages = 995\u20131017 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21058748 | doi = 10.2165/11536870-000000000-00000 }}</ref> cycling and running time trial performance,<ref name=\"Peripheral and central ergogenic effects\" /> endurance (i.e., it delays the onset of [[muscle fatigue]] and [[central fatigue]]),<ref name=\"Peripheral and central ergogenic effects\" /><ref name=\"pmid21411838\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Conger SA, Warren GL, Hardy MA, Millard-Stafford ML | title = Does caffeine added to carbohydrate provide additional ergogenic benefit for endurance?

The first totalisators were introduced about this time. They faced opposition from a curious alliance of bookmakers and anti-gambling factions but were approved by the Clubs and licensed by the Colonial Secretary. The first trotting race on a racecourse in Canterbury, in 1875, before the totalisator was introduced, the stake was only about a \"tenner\" (\u00a310), but the match created a lot of interest. About 1880, Lower Heathcote Racing Club was founded, supporting gallops, but added trotting events to its programme, giving smaller stakes. Some years later the club discontinued gallops and became the Lower Heathcote Trotting Club, which gave stakes ranging from \u00a315 to \u00a335.<ref name=\"addington\" />\n\nThe New South Wales bred, [[Lawn Derby]], racing un-hoppled, was the first pacer to break the two-minute barrier in Australia or New Zealand when he recorded 1:59.4 at the Addington track in New Zealand in 1938.<ref>[http://www.brisbaneracing.com.au/article.php?current_article=2571 Brisbane racing: Did you know these harness racing facts?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015060102/http://brisbaneracing.com.au/article.php?current_article=2571 |date=2009-10-15 }} Retrieved 2010-7-18</ref> \n\nFrom these early stages, the sport has developed with top races and top horses from then right up to the present day.\n\n==Prominent people==\n\n* James Bryce\n* [[Anthony Butt]]\n* [[Cecil Devine]]\n* [[Tony Herlihy]]\n* [[Free Holmes | Freeman Holmes]]\n* [[Maurice Holmes (harness racer) | Maurice Holmes]]\n* [[Charlie Hunter (trainer) | Charlie Hunter]]\n* [[John Langdon (driver) | John Langdon]]\n* Maurice McKendry \n* [[Roy McKenzie]]\n* Ricky May\n* Reon Murtha - long-standing race caller\n* [[Denis Nyhan]]\n* [[Mark Purdon]]\n* Roy Purdon\n* Natalie Rasmussen \n* [[Steven Reid (harness racer)| Steven Reid]]\n* Jack Smolenski\n* [[Doody Townley]]\n* [[Peter Wolfenden]]\n\n==Prominent New Zealand horses==\n\n* [[Auckland Reactor]]\n* [[Caduceus (horse) |Caduceus]]\n* [[Captain Sandy]]\n* [[Cardigan Bay]]\n* [[Chokin]]\n* [[Christian Cullen (horse) |Christian Cullen]]\n* Courage Under Fire\n* [[Delightful Lady]]\n* [[Easton Light]]\n* [[Elsu]]\n* [[False Step]]\n* [[Flashing Red]]\n* [[Harold Logan]]\n* [[Highland Fling (horse) | Highland Fling]]\n* [[Il Vicolo]]\n* [[Im Themightyquinn]]\n* [[Indianapolis (horse)| Indianapolis]]\n* [[Johnny Globe ]]\n* Lazarus\n* [[Lord Module]]\n* [[Lordship (horse) | Lordship]]\n* [[Lyell Creek]]\n* [[Monkey King (horse) | Monkey King]]\n* Noodlum\n* [[Ordeal (horse) | Ordeal]]\n* [[Our Sir Vancelot]]\n* [[Robalan ]]\n* Robin Dundee\n* Roydon Glen\n* [[Smoken Up]]\n* [[Take A Moment]]\n* [[Terror to Love]]\n* [[Young Quinn]]\n\n== Major New Zealand harness races ==\n[[Image:Uncle Petrika (harness racing-trotter).jpg|thumb|200px|right|NZ trotter Uncle Petrika]]\nIn [[New Zealand]] the richest and most important race is the [[New Zealand Trotting Cup]], run for older pacers in November at Addington.

differs from [[North America]]n racing in that [[Metric system|metric]] distances are used. Races are at distances between 1600m and 3200m. \n\nAnother large difference is that in [[New Zealand]] racing the leader does not have to hand up the lead to any horse that challenges, often leaving a horse parked outside the leader in the \"death seat\", \"the death\", or \"facing the breeze\", as this horse covers more ground than the leader.\n\nNew Zealand races may have a field of up to 16 horses, although as numbers of horses have reduced some races will have less than 10 starters.  This generally means that with the smaller tracks a \"three wide train\" starts as the field gets the bell at signal their final lap.\n\nThere is a system of an 'open lane' or 'passing lane' ('sprint lane' in Australia). These lanes do not operate on all tracks and have been a point of argument between many industry participants. \n\nNew Zealand horses are able to easily \"cross the [[Tasman Sea|Tasman]]\" to Australia, as the rules are similar.\n\n== United States and Canada ==\nThe association with trotting in New Zealand and the United States has always been strong, with much of the breeding stock coming from America. Particularly in the 1950s and 1960s, New Zealand horses competed in both Canada and the United States. The first New Zealand horse to be raced in America by a New Zealander was the trotter Vodka, the winner of the 1953 [[Dominion Handicap]]. He was taken there in 1956 by his owner, J. S. Shaw, won 11 races and was later leased to American interests.\n\nIn 1960 [[Caduceus (horse)|Caduceus]] was the first New Zealand pacer to compete in the [[Yonkers Raceway|Yonkers International Series]] with his trainer-driver, J. D. Litten. Despite his nine years, Caduceus showed he was the equal of the top American horses, winning the last race of the series, only to be disqualified. He also was leased to American interests and at 10 years of age was still winning races.\n\n[[False Step]] was driven in the Yonkers International series during the 1960\u201361 season by his trainer [[C C Devine]]. False Step's performances showed he was one of the greatest pacers in the world. He beat the acknowledged American champion, [[Adios Butler]], in a 1\u00bd mile race. He was sold in America for 115,000 dollars, the fifth highest price paid for a pacer in the United States. \n\nArania also entered the series with False Step. She did not do well, but after being leased won several races and proved she was able to race with the best in America, and in fact created a record of 1 min 57 sec for 1 mile in the Lexington Red Mile.<ref>[http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/R/RacingTrotting/NewZealandHorsesInAmerica/en New Zealand Horses in America]</ref>\n\nIn 1964, [[Cardigan Bay (horse)|Cardigan Bay]] was to travel to America with reinsman [[Stanley Dancer]], who paid 100,000 dollars for the horse. Cardigan Bay was already an established racehorse in New Zealand, having won the 1963 [[New Zealand Trotting Cup]] and other top races in Australia and New Zealand. He went on to win over a million dollars in the United States, the first harness horse ever to do so.\n\n\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Harness racing]]\n*[[Harness racing in Australia]]\n*[[Horse racing]]\n*[[Glossary of Australian and New Zealand punting]]\n*[[Thoroughbred racing in New Zealand]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons cat|Harness racing in New Zealand}}\n*[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/racing-trotting/1 ''Racing, Trotting'', from An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand]\n\n{{Oceania topic|Harness racing in}}\n{{Sport in New Zealand}}\n\n[[Category:Harness racing in New Zealand|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|equestrian sport}}\n'''Harness racing in New Zealand''' is more often called '''trotting''' in the \"old school\"  rather than the more fashionable name of \"harness racing\".<ref>[http://www.addington.co.nz/Timeline.asp?Case=6&ItemId=6&AlphaId=4&CategoryId=3 Trotting in New Zealand with reinsman C C Devine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018073231/http://www.addington.co.nz/Timeline.asp?Case=6&ItemId=6&AlphaId=4&CategoryId=3 |date=2008-10-18 }}</ref> The sport is long standing with events being held as early as 1864.

The first totalisators were introduced about this time. They faced opposition from a curious alliance of bookmakers and anti-gambling factions but were approved by the Clubs and licensed by the Colonial Secretary. The first trotting race on a racecourse in Canterbury, in 1875, before the totalisator was introduced, the stake was only about a \"tenner\" (\u00a310), but the match created a lot of interest. About 1880, Lower Heathcote Racing Club was founded, supporting gallops, but added trotting events to its programme, giving smaller stakes. Some years later the club discontinued gallops and became the Lower Heathcote Trotting Club, which gave stakes ranging from \u00a315 to \u00a335.<ref name=\"addington\" />\n\nThe New South Wales bred, [[Lawn Derby]], racing un-hoppled, was the first pacer to break the two-minute barrier in Australia or New Zealand when he recorded 1:59.4 at the Addington track in New Zealand in 1938.<ref>[http://www.brisbaneracing.com.au/article.php?current_article=2571 Brisbane racing: Did you know these harness racing facts?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015060102/http://brisbaneracing.com.au/article.php?current_article=2571 |date=2009-10-15 }} Retrieved 2010-7-18</ref> \n\nFrom these early stages, the sport has developed with top races and top horses from then right up to the present day.\n\n==Prominent people==\n\n* James Bryce\n* [[Anthony Butt]]\n* [[Cecil Devine]]\n* [[Tony Herlihy]]\n* [[Free Holmes | Freeman Holmes]]\n* [[Maurice Holmes (harness racer) | Maurice Holmes]]\n* [[Charlie Hunter (trainer) | Charlie Hunter]]\n* [[John Langdon (driver) | John Langdon]]\n* Maurice McKendry \n* [[Roy McKenzie]]\n* Ricky May\n* Reon Murtha - long-standing race caller\n* [[Denis Nyhan]]\n* [[Mark Purdon]]\n* Roy Purdon\n* Natalie Rasmussen \n* [[Steven Reid (harness racer)| Steven Reid]]\n* Jack Smolenski\n* [[Doody Townley]]\n* [[Peter Wolfenden]]\n\n==Prominent New Zealand horses==\n\n* [[Auckland Reactor]]\n* [[Caduceus (horse) |Caduceus]]\n* [[Captain Sandy]]\n* [[Cardigan Bay]]\n* [[Chokin]]\n* [[Christian Cullen (horse) |Christian Cullen]]\n* Courage Under Fire\n* [[Delightful Lady]]\n* [[Easton Light]]\n* [[Elsu]]\n* [[False Step]]\n* [[Flashing Red]]\n* [[Harold Logan]]\n* [[Highland Fling (horse) | Highland Fling]]\n* [[Il Vicolo]]\n* [[Im Themightyquinn]]\n* [[Indianapolis (horse)| Indianapolis]]\n* [[Johnny Globe ]]\n* Lazarus\n* [[Lord Module]]\n* [[Lordship (horse) | Lordship]]\n* [[Lyell Creek]]\n* [[Monkey King (horse) | Monkey King]]\n* Noodlum\n* [[Ordeal (horse) | Ordeal]]\n* [[Our Sir Vancelot]]\n* [[Robalan ]]\n* Robin Dundee\n* Royden Glen\n* [[Smoken Up]]\n* [[Take A Moment]]\n* [[Terror to Love]]\n* [[Young Quinn]]\n\n== Major New Zealand harness races ==\n[[Image:Uncle Petrika (harness racing-trotter).jpg|thumb|200px|right|NZ trotter Uncle Petrika]]\nIn [[New Zealand]] the richest and most important race is the [[New Zealand Trotting Cup]], run for older pacers in November at Addington.

differs from [[North America]]n racing in that [[Metric system|metric]] distances are used. Races are at distances between 1600m and 3200m. \n\nAnother large difference is that in [[New Zealand]] racing the leader does not have to hand up the lead to any horse that challenges, often leaving a horse parked outside the leader in the \"death seat\", \"the death\", or \"facing the breeze\", as this horse covers more ground than the leader.\n\nNew Zealand races may have a field of up to 16 horses, although as numbers of horses have reduced some races will have less than 10 starters.  This generally means that with the smaller tracks a \"three wide train\" starts as the field gets the bell at signal their final lap.\n\nThere is a system of an 'open lane' or 'passing lane' ('sprint lane' in Australia). These lanes do not operate on all tracks and have been a point of argument between many industry participants. \n\nNew Zealand horses are able to easily \"cross the [[Tasman Sea|Tasman]]\" to Australia, as the rules are similar.\n\n== United States and Canada ==\nThe association with trotting in New Zealand and the United States has always been strong, with much of the breeding stock coming from America. Particularly in the 1950s and 1960s, New Zealand horses competed in both Canada and the United States. The first New Zealand horse to be raced in America by a New Zealander was the trotter Vodka, the winner of the 1953 [[Dominion Handicap]]. He was taken there in 1956 by his owner, J. S. Shaw, won 11 races and was later leased to American interests.\n\nIn 1960 [[Caduceus (horse)|Caduceus]] was the first New Zealand pacer to compete in the [[Yonkers Raceway|Yonkers International Series]] with his trainer-driver, J. D. Litten. Despite his nine years, Caduceus showed he was the equal of the top American horses, winning the last race of the series, only to be disqualified. He also was leased to American interests and at 10 years of age was still winning races.\n\n[[False Step]] was driven in the Yonkers International series during the 1960\u201361 season by his trainer [[C C Devine]].

Trained as an [[artillery]] officer, he joined the [[Red Army]] in 1920. He graduated from several Soviet military academies, including the [[Military Academy of Red Army General Staff]]. He participated in the [[Winter War]] of 1939\u20131940 against Finland as a senior artillery officer.<ref name=\"Govorov on warheroes.ru\">{{Ruheroes|id= 1078|accessdate= 21 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn World War II, Govorov rose to command an army in November 1941 during the [[Battle of Moscow]]. He commanded the [[Leningrad Front]] from April 1942 to the end of the war. He reached the rank of [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]] in 1944, was awarded the title of [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] and many other awards.<ref name=\"Glantz p. 214\">Glantz p. 214</ref>\n\n==Early years and Russian Revolution==\nLeonid Aleksandrovich Govorov was born into a peasant family of [[Russians|Russian]] ethnicity in the village of [[Sovetsky District, Kirov Oblast|Butyrki]] in [[Vyatka Governorate]] (now in [[Kirov Oblast]]).<ref name=\"Govorov on warheroes.ru\" /> He attended a technical high school in [[Yelabuga]] and enrolled in the shipbuilding department of [[Petrograd Polytechnical Institute]]. In December 1916, however, he was mobilized and was sent to the Konstantinovskye Artillery School, from which he graduated in 1917. He became an [[artillery]] officer with the rank of [[Poruchik|podporuchik]].<ref name=\"Govorov on warheroes.ru\" />\n\nWhen the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] broke out and the Russian Army disintegrated, Govorov returned home, but was conscripted into the [[White movement|White Guard]] army of [[Aleksandr Kolchak]] in October 1918, serving in an artillery battery with the [[8th Kama Rifle Division]] of the [[2nd Ufa Army Corps]] in the [[Western Separate Army|Western Army]], fighting in the [[Russian Civil War]]. Govorov fought in the [[Spring Offensive of the Russian Army (1919)|Spring Offensive of the Russian Army]], a general drive westwards by White forces in the east. He deserted in November 1919, fleeing to [[Tomsk]], where he took part in an uprising against White authorities as part of a [[Fighting squad (Bolsheviks)|fighting squad]]. Govorov joined the [[Red Army]] in January 1920, serving in the [[51st Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|51st Rifle Division]] as an artillery battalion commander. With the division, he fought in the [[Siege of Perekop (1920)|Siege of Perekop]] in November, during which Soviet forces drove [[Pyotr Wrangel]]'s White Army out of [[Crimea]]. Govorov was wounded twice during the year and was awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner]] in 1921 for his actions in Crimea.<ref name=\"Govorov on warheroes.ru\" />\n\n==Interwar years==\n[[File:Leonid Govorov1923.JPG|left|thumb|150px| Govorov with his wife, 1923]]\nGovorov obtained further military education, graduating from the Artillery course in 1926, the Higher Academy course in 1930, and the [[Frunze Military Academy]] in 1933. In 1936, Govorov was among the first officers who attended the newly founded [[Military Academy of Red Army General Staff]], from which he graduated in 1938.<ref>Glantz, p 214</ref>\n\nFrom 1936, he was head of artillery in the [[Kiev Military District]]. In 1938 he was appointed as lecturer in tactics at the Dzerzhinsky Artillery Academy. In 1939, he finished his first research publication.<ref name=\"Kiselev p. 115\">Kiselev p. 115</ref> This was the period of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]]. Govorov was close to being arrested, but in the end survived thanks to the intervention of [[Mikhail Kalinin]]<ref>[[John Erickson (historian)|John Erickson]], ''The Road to Stalingrad: Stalin's War with Germany'', Vol. 1 (Yale University Press, 1999: {{ISBN|0-300-07812-9}}), p. 6.</ref> and continued to rise in rank.<ref name=\"Glantz p. 214\"/>\n\n==Winter War==\nIn 1939 the [[Soviet-Finnish War]] broke out, and Govorov was appointed chief of artillery of the [[7th Army (Soviet Union)|7th Army]], as his research while at Dzerzhinsky Artillery Academy was about assaulting and penetrating fortified enemy positions. He commanded the massive artillery assault that allowed the Soviet breakthrough along the [[Mannerheim Line]] in 1940. For this he was awarded the [[Order of the Red Star]] and promoted to the rank of division commander. He was then appointed Deputy Inspector-General of Artillery of the Red Army.<ref name=\"Kiselev p. 115\"/>\n\n==World War II==\n\n===1941 and early 1942===\nAfter [[Nazi Germany]] invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, Govorov commanded the Artillery on the [[Western Front (Soviet Union)|Western Front]] in [[Belarus]] from August to October 1941. During the [[Battle of Moscow]], he was appointed Chief of Artillery of the [[Fifth Army (Soviet Union)|5th Army]], under the command of Major General [[Dmitri Danilovich Lelyushenko]]. After Lelyushenko was wounded on 18 October Govorov assumed command of the army. During the Soviet counter-offensives in the winter of 1941\u201342, his army liberated [[Mozhaisk]]. As a result, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general of artillery.<ref name=\"Glantz, p. 214\">Glantz, p. 214</ref>\n\n===Defense of Leningrad===\nIn April 1942 Govorov was appointed commander of the Leningrad Group of Forces of the [[Leningrad Front]], which combined the former Leningrad and [[Volkhov Front]]s.<ref>Glantz (2002), p. 182</ref> In July, the Volkhov Front was re-established, and Govorov became the head of the entire Leningrad Front, replacing Lieutenant General M.S. Khosin. Leningrad had been cut off from the rest of the country since September 1941, and the Soviet forces were trying to lift the [[siege of Leningrad]], which was causing colossal [[Effect of the Siege of Leningrad on the city|damage to the city]] and suffering to the civilian population. The [[Road of Life]], which was the only means of supply to the city, was frequently cut by regular German and Finnish air strikes. Soviet forces launched several offensives  in the region in 1942, but these failed to lift the siege.  The [[Lyuban Offensive Operation]]  resulted in the encirclement and destruction of most of the Soviet [[2nd Shock Army]].<ref>Isayev p. 134</ref> In this situation, Govorov's background as an artilleryman was considered most valuable, since the city was under constant shelling, and one of Govorov's tasks was to launch an artillery counter-offensive against the German guns.<ref name=\"Glantz, p. 214\"/>\n\nAs soon as he became the commander of the Leningrad Front in July 1942, Govorov mounted local attacks in several sectors of the front, while preparing a much larger offensive. Together with the Volkhov Front, the Leningrad Front would break the blockade of the city by eliminating the German positions south of [[Ladoga Lake]], where only {{convert|16|km|mi}} separated the Leningrad and Volkhov Fronts. This position was called \"the bottleneck\". At the same time, German forces were planning [[Operation Nordlicht (1942)|Operation Northern Light]] ({{lang-de|Nordlicht}}) to capture the city and link up with Finnish forces. To achieve that, heavy reinforcements arrived from [[Sevastopol]], which the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1941\u20131942)|German forces had captured]] in July 1942.<ref>Glantz (2002), p. 213\u2013214</ref> Both sides were unaware of the other's preparations. As a result, the Soviet [[Sinyavino Offensive (1942)|Sinyavino Offensive]] failed and the 2nd Shock army was decimated for the second time in a year, but the German forces suffered heavy casualties and canceled Operation Northern Light.<ref>Glantz, p.230</ref>\n\n[[File:Iskra 21-1-43.jpg|thumb|Operation Iskra, January 1943]]\nIn late November 1942, Govorov began planning the next operation to break the blockade of Leningrad. In December, the plan was approved by the [[Stavka]] and received the codename [[Operation Iskra]] (Spark).<ref>Glantz p. 265</ref> Operation Iskra began on 13 January 1943, and on 18 January Soviet forces linked up, breaking the blockade. By 22 January the front line stabilized. The operation successfully opened a land corridor 8\u201310&nbsp;km wide to the city. A railroad was swiftly built through the corridor that allowed far more supplies to reach the city than the \"Road of Life\", eliminating the possibility of the capture of the city and a German-Finnish link up.<ref>Glantz p. 284\u2013285</ref> Govorov was promoted to [[Colonel General]] on 15 January and was awarded the [[Order of Suvorov]] 1st Class on 28 January.<ref>Kiselev p. 140</ref>\n\nThe Leningrad and Volkhov Fronts tried to follow up their success with a much more ambitious offensive operation named [[Operation Polyarnaya Zvezda]] (Polar Star). This operation had the aim of decisively defeating the German [[Army Group North]], but achieved very modest gains.<ref>Glantz p. 284</ref> Several other offensives were conducted by Govorov in the area in 1943, slowly expanding the corridor into Leningrad, and making other small gains.<ref>Glantz p. 323</ref> In November 1943, Govorov began planning the [[Leningrad-Novgorod Offensive]] which would drive Army Group North out of the Leningrad region.<ref>Glantz p. 333</ref> On 17 November he was promoted to [[Army General (Russia)|army general]].<ref name=\"Govorov on warheroes.ru\" />\n\n===Soviet Counter Offensive===\nThe Soviet offensive started on 14 January 1944. By 1 March the Leningrad, Volkhov and 2nd Baltic Fronts had driven Army Group North back up to {{convert|300|km|mi}} on a {{convert|400|km|mi}} front, liberating the southern Leningrad region and part of the Kalinin region.<ref name=\"Glantz p. 410\">Glantz p. 410</ref> By that time, the reinforced Germans forces were at the \"Panther Line\", stretching from [[Narva]] to [[Pskov]] using [[Lake Peipus|Lake Pskov]] as a barrier, where the offensive was stopped in several [[Battle of Narva (1944)|heavy battles around Narva]].<ref name=\"Glantz p. 410\"/> On 18 April the Soviet forces were ordered to the defense, a new [[3rd Baltic Front]] was created to coordinate operations near Narva and Govorov's Leningrad Front turned attention to the north.<ref>Glantz p. 409\u2013410</ref> In June 1944, during the [[Vyborg\u2013Petrozavodsk Offensive]], which led to Soviet recapture of Vyborg, Govorov was promoted to the rank of [[marshal of the Soviet Union]]. Later his forces recaptured the Baltic states, and in autumn 1944 his forces blocked Army Group North in what became known as [[Courland Pocket]]. On 27 January 1945, Govorov was awarded the title of [[Hero of the Soviet Union]].<ref name=\"Govorov on warheroes.ru\" />\n\n==Post-war career==\nIn the postwar years Govorov was commander of the [[Leningrad Military District]], and then Chief Inspector of Ground Forces. In 1948 he was appointed Commander of [[Soviet Air Defence Forces|National Air Defence Forces]], and in 1952 he also became Deputy Minister of Defence. In these posts he oversaw the modernization of the Soviet air defence system for the age of the [[jet aircraft]] and the [[atomic bomb]].

Trained as an [[artillery]] officer, he joined the [[Red Army]] in 1920. He graduated from several Soviet military academies, including the [[Military Academy of Red Army General Staff]]. He participated in the [[Winter War]] of 1939-1940 against Finland as a senior artillery officer.<ref name=\"Govorov on warheroes.ru\">{{Ruheroes|id= 1078|accessdate= 21 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn World War II, Govorov rose to command an army in November 1941 during the [[Battle of Moscow]]. He commanded the [[Leningrad Front]] from April 1942 to the end of the war. He reached the rank of [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]] in 1944, was awarded the title of [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] and many other awards.<ref name=\"Glantz p. 214\">Glantz p. 214</ref>\n\n==Early years and Russian Revolution==\nLeonid Aleksandrovich Govorov was born into a peasant family of [[Russians|Russian]] ethnicity in the village of [[Sovetsky District, Kirov Oblast|Butyrki]] in [[Vyatka Governorate]] (now in [[Kirov Oblast]]).<ref name=\"Govorov on warheroes.ru\" /> He attended a technical high school in [[Yelabuga]] and enrolled in the shipbuilding department of [[Petrograd Polytechnical Institute]]. In December 1916, however, he was mobilized and was sent to the Konstantinovskye Artillery School, from which he graduated in 1917. He became an [[artillery]] officer with the rank of [[Poruchik|podporuchik]].<ref name=\"Govorov on warheroes.ru\" />\n\nWhen the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] broke out and the Russian Army disintegrated, Govorov returned home, but was conscripted into the [[White movement|White Guard]] army of [[Aleksandr Kolchak]] in October 1918, serving in an artillery battery with the [[8th Kama Rifle Division]] of the [[2nd Ufa Army Corps]] in the [[Western Separate Army|Western Army]], fighting in the [[Russian Civil War]]. Govorov fought in the [[Spring Offensive of the Russian Army (1919)|Spring Offensive of the Russian Army]], a general drive westwards by White forces in the east. He deserted in November 1919, fleeing to [[Tomsk]], where he took part in an uprising against White authorities as part of a [[Fighting squad (Bolsheviks)|fighting squad]]. Govorov joined the [[Red Army]] in January 1920, serving in the [[51st Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|51st Rifle Division]] as an artillery battalion commander. With the division, he fought in the [[Siege of Perekop (1920)|Siege of Perekop]] in November, during which Soviet forces drove [[Pyotr Wrangel]]'s White Army out of [[Crimea]]. Govorov was wounded twice during the year and was awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner]] in 1921 for his actions in Crimea.<ref name=\"Govorov on warheroes.ru\" />\n\n==Interwar years==\n[[File:Leonid Govorov1923.JPG|left|thumb|150px| Govorov with his wife, 1923]]\nGovorov obtained further military education, graduating from the Artillery course in 1926, the Higher Academy course in 1930, and the [[Frunze Military Academy]] in 1933. In 1936, Govorov was among the first officers who attended the newly founded [[Military Academy of Red Army General Staff]], from which he graduated in 1938.<ref>Glantz, p 214</ref>\n\nFrom 1936, he was head of artillery in the [[Kiev Military District]]. In 1938 he was appointed as lecturer in tactics at the Dzerzhinsky Artillery Academy. In 1939, he finished his first research publication.<ref name=\"Kiselev p. 115\">Kiselev p. 115</ref> This was the period of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]]. Govorov was close to being arrested, but in the end survived thanks to the intervention of [[Mikhail Kalinin]]<ref>[[John Erickson (historian)|John Erickson]], ''The Road to Stalingrad: Stalin's War with Germany'', Vol. 1 (Yale University Press, 1999: {{ISBN|0-300-07812-9}}), p. 6.</ref> and continued to rise in rank.<ref name=\"Glantz p. 214\"/>\n\n==Winter War==\nIn 1939 the [[Soviet-Finnish War]] broke out, and Govorov was appointed chief of artillery of the [[7th Army (Soviet Union)|7th Army]], as his research while at Dzerzhinsky Artillery Academy was about assaulting and penetrating fortified enemy positions. He commanded the massive artillery assault that allowed the Soviet breakthrough along the [[Mannerheim Line]] in 1940. For this he was awarded the [[Order of the Red Star]] and promoted to the rank of division commander. He was then appointed Deputy Inspector-General of Artillery of the Red Army.<ref name=\"Kiselev p. 115\"/>\n\n==World War II==\n\n===1941 and early 1942===\nAfter [[Nazi Germany]] invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, Govorov commanded the Artillery on the [[Western Front (Soviet Union)|Western Front]] in [[Belarus]] from August to October 1941. During the [[Battle of Moscow]], he was appointed Chief of Artillery of the [[Fifth Army (Soviet Union)|5th Army]], under the command of Major General [[Dmitri Danilovich Lelyushenko]]. After Lelyushenko was wounded on 18 October Govorov assumed command of the army. During the Soviet counter-offensives in the winter of 1941\u201342, his army liberated [[Mozhaisk]]. As a result, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general of artillery.<ref name=\"Glantz, p. 214\">Glantz, p. 214</ref>\n\n===Defense of Leningrad===\nIn April 1942 Govorov was appointed commander of the Leningrad Group of Forces of the [[Leningrad Front]], which combined the former Leningrad and [[Volkhov Front]]s.<ref>Glantz (2002), p. 182</ref> In July, the Volkhov Front was re-established, and Govorov became the head of the entire Leningrad Front, replacing Lieutenant General M.S. Khosin. Leningrad had been cut off from the rest of the country since September 1941, and the Soviet forces were trying to lift the [[siege of Leningrad]], which was causing colossal [[Effect of the Siege of Leningrad on the city|damage to the city]] and suffering to the civilian population. The [[Road of Life]], which was the only means of supply to the city, was frequently cut by regular German and Finnish air strikes. Soviet forces launched several offensives  in the region in 1942, but these failed to lift the siege.  The [[Lyuban Offensive Operation]]  resulted in the encirclement and destruction of most of the Soviet [[2nd Shock Army]].<ref>Isayev p. 134</ref> In this situation, Govorov's background as an artilleryman was considered most valuable, since the city was under constant shelling, and one of Govorov's tasks was to launch an artillery counter-offensive against the German guns.<ref name=\"Glantz, p. 214\"/>\n\nAs soon as he became the commander of the Leningrad Front in July 1942, Govorov mounted local attacks in several sectors of the front, while preparing a much larger offensive. Together with the Volkhov Front, the Leningrad Front would break the blockade of the city by eliminating the German positions south of [[Ladoga Lake]], where only {{convert|16|km|mi}} separated the Leningrad and Volkhov Fronts. This position was called \"the bottleneck\". At the same time, German forces were planning [[Operation Nordlicht (1942)|Operation Northern Light]] ({{lang-de|Nordlicht}}) to capture the city and link up with Finnish forces. To achieve that, heavy reinforcements arrived from [[Sevastopol]], which the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1941\u20131942)|German forces had captured]] in July 1942.<ref>Glantz (2002), p. 213\u2013214</ref> Both sides were unaware of the other's preparations. As a result, the Soviet [[Sinyavino Offensive (1942)|Sinyavino Offensive]] failed and the 2nd Shock army was decimated for the second time in a year, but the German forces suffered heavy casualties and canceled Operation Northern Light.<ref>Glantz, p.230</ref>\n\n[[File:Iskra 21-1-43.jpg|thumb|Operation Iskra, January 1943]]\nIn late November 1942, Govorov began planning the next operation to break the blockade of Leningrad. In December, the plan was approved by the [[Stavka]] and received the codename [[Operation Iskra]] (Spark).<ref>Glantz p. 265</ref> Operation Iskra began on 13 January 1943, and on 18 January Soviet forces linked up, breaking the blockade. By 22 January the front line stabilized. The operation successfully opened a land corridor 8\u201310&nbsp;km wide to the city. A railroad was swiftly built through the corridor that allowed far more supplies to reach the city than the \"Road of Life\", eliminating the possibility of the capture of the city and a German-Finnish link up.<ref>Glantz p. 284\u2013285</ref> Govorov was promoted to [[Colonel General]] on 15 January and was awarded the [[Order of Suvorov]] 1st Class on 28 January.<ref>Kiselev p. 140</ref>\n\nThe Leningrad and Volkhov Fronts tried to follow up their success with a much more ambitious offensive operation named [[Operation Polyarnaya Zvezda]] (Polar Star). This operation had the aim of decisively defeating the German [[Army Group North]], but achieved very modest gains.<ref>Glantz p. 284</ref> Several other offensives were conducted by Govorov in the area in 1943, slowly expanding the corridor into Leningrad, and making other small gains.<ref>Glantz p. 323</ref> In November 1943, Govorov began planning the [[Leningrad-Novgorod Offensive]] which would drive Army Group North out of the Leningrad region.<ref>Glantz p. 333</ref> On 17 November he was promoted to [[Army General (Russia)|army general]].<ref name=\"Govorov on warheroes.ru\" />\n\n===Soviet Counter Offensive===\nThe Soviet offensive started on 14 January 1944. By 1 March the Leningrad, Volkhov and 2nd Baltic Fronts had driven Army Group North back up to {{convert|300|km|mi}} on a {{convert|400|km|mi}} front, liberating the southern Leningrad region and part of the Kalinin region.<ref name=\"Glantz p. 410\">Glantz p. 410</ref> By that time, the reinforced Germans forces were at the \"Panther Line\", stretching from [[Narva]] to [[Pskov]] using [[Lake Peipus|Lake Pskov]] as a barrier, where the offensive was stopped in several [[Battle of Narva (1944)|heavy battles around Narva]].<ref name=\"Glantz p. 410\"/> On 18 April the Soviet forces were ordered to the defense, a new [[3rd Baltic Front]] was created to coordinate operations near Narva and Govorov's Leningrad Front turned attention to the north.<ref>Glantz p. 409\u2013410</ref> In June 1944, during the [[Vyborg\u2013Petrozavodsk Offensive]], which led to Soviet recapture of Vyborg, Govorov was promoted to the rank of [[marshal of the Soviet Union]]. Later his forces recaptured the Baltic states, and in autumn 1944 his forces blocked Army Group North in what became known as [[Courland Pocket]]. On 27 January 1945, Govorov was awarded the title of [[Hero of the Soviet Union]].<ref name=\"Govorov on warheroes.ru\" />\n\n==Post-war career==\nIn the postwar years Govorov was commander of the [[Leningrad Military District]], and then Chief Inspector of Ground Forces. In 1948 he was appointed Commander of [[Soviet Air Defence Forces|National Air Defence Forces]], and in 1952 he also became Deputy Minister of Defence.

Sotira entrusted all public aspects of the project to Scott Jarkoff as an engineer and visionary to launch the early program. All three co-founders shared backgrounds in the application skinning community, but it was Matt Stephens whose major contribution to DeviantArt was the suggestion to take the concept further than [[Skin (computing)|skinning]] and more toward an \"art community\".

''[http://www.grettonbook.com/home Charles Gretton: Clock and Watchmaking Through The Golden Age]'', published in 2016, lists 74 extant longcase clocks, 52 spring clocks, five [[Lantern clock|lantern clocks]] and 29 [[Watch|watches]], but more have been discovered since.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). ''Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age''. P. 577 - 591.</ref> \n\nGretton made more watches than clocks, as did many of his contemporaries. Based on dating of his extant clocks and watches, it would seem that his workshop began producing watches in about 1673, followed by clocks in the mid-1670s. Gretton\u2019s peak production lasted about 25 years, from approximately 1685 until about 1710, when his output dropped significantly.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). ''Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age''. P. 541</ref> He continued to make at least clocks until the mid-1720s, when it is believed he retired from clockmaking. However, Gretton maintained a strong relationship with the [[Worshipful Company of Clockmakers|Clockmakers\u2019 Company]] until the very last years of his life.\n\nGretton's earliest known extant watch dates to before 1675 and is on display at the [[British Museum]], London. The watch has crystals on both front and back, the back revealing the gilt brass top plate, which includes a subsidiary seconds dial, even though this is a pre-balance spring watch. Because of its complexity, this certainly would not have been Gretton's first watch.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). ''Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age''. P. 419, 443 - 447.</ref> Gretton produced [https://www.lexico.com/definition/timepiece timepieces], [[mwod:clock watch|clock watches]], alarm watches, several forms of repeating watches (i.e., which contained [[Repeater (horology)|repeaters]]), and [[polychrome]] decorated watches with [https://anordain.com/blogs/news/this-is-everything-you-need-to-know-about-enamel-dials-part-1 enamel dials] and [[porcelain]] boxes. Many of the extant watches retain their boxes and cases; some of the makers of these items can be identified.\n\nGretton clocks were always of the highest quality, comparable to those of London's best makers. His early [[Grandfather clock|longcase clocks]] were housed in walnut cases. Later, the cases had [[parquetry]] decoration, followed by floral [[marquetry]], arabesque and then seaweed marquetry, [[ebony]]-veneered cases, and [[lacquer]]-decorated cases. He returned to walnut for his late longcase clocks.\n\nMost of Gretton\u2019s longcase movements had countwheel-[[Striking clock|striking]] control, although some had rack striking and quarter striking. Many early clocks had bolt-and-shutter [[maintaining power]].\n\nGretton's spring clocks were usually in an ebony-veneered or ebonized case with little or no decoration, other than the carrying handle. Gretton was, however, an early user of gilt basket-top cases. Most clocks originally stood on ebonized pad feet. Some peak-period spring clocks could be housed in a marquetry or [[Kingwood (wood)|kingwood]] case.\n\nAlmost all spring clocks employed rack striking. Gretton was an early adopter, if not the originator, of a strike/silent mechanism. Clocks employing this mechanism, but signed by at least one other maker (Hessenius), certainly originated from Gretton's workshop.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). ''Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age''. P. 279 - 281.</ref> \n\nGretton was also an early adopter of mechanisms for silent-pull timepieces, several forms of which are known.

The Clockmakers\u2019 Company Court appointed Gretton to represent the Company as a proprietor with the [[Bank of England]] in 1714, and he held this position for several years.<ref>The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers: Court Minutes, 5 April 1714, MS2701/3.</ref>\n\n== Philanthropic Activities ==\nCharles Gretton became very successful in business and had the means to acquire wealth and a number of urban and rural properties. He had a keen interest in philanthropy, particularly relating to education. In 1701, he donated \u00a350 to the Clockmakers\u2019 Company to fund apprenticeships for orphaned sons of clockmakers.<ref>The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers: Court Minutes, 1 September 1701, MS2710/3.</ref> In 1704, the first boy started his apprenticeship with the help of this fund.

He also was a Common Councilman for the Ward of [[Farringdon Without]], representing the [[parish]] of St Dunstan-in-the-West for many years.\n\nHe served as a tax commissioner, and at times as an adjuster, for [[Ludgate]] and for both precincts of the parish of [[St Martin, Ludgate]].\n\n== Marriages ==\nCharles Gretton and Mary (n\u00e9e Phillips) married in 1678. They had ten children, only three of whom survived into adulthood. Mary Gretton died in December 1698, as did two of the children.\n\nTheir son Phillips attended [[St Paul's School, London|St Paul\u2019s School]], London, and [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], attaining his [[Doctor of Divinity]] degree at the latter.<ref>The Admission Registers of St Paul's School from 1748 to 1876, edited by Robert Gardiner.

Charles Gretton lived the very last years of his life with Ann at the Houghton home in [[Milk Street, London|Milk Street]], London. Ann was buried in Springfield in January 1752/53, where her nephew, Phillips' son, had become the rector.\n\nLittle is known about Thomas, the youngest son. He married Elizabeth Turner, a widow. The Ship was willed to Thomas, but \u00a310 of the yearly rent funded the charities in Claypole. Thomas was also buried in Springfield.\n\nCharles Gretton married Lucy Uffman in 1700, but she must have died, because Gretton was married again in 1711, this time to Dorothea Wilson. Gretton became a widower for the third time in 1727.\n\n== Death ==\nCharles Gretton died on 25 June 1731 and was buried at St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street, on 5 July 1731.

Accordingly, play can range from relaxed, free-spirited and spontaneous through frivolous to planned or even compulsive.<ref name=Huizinga>{{cite book|last1=Huizinga|first1=J|title=Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play Element in Culture|date=1980|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd.|location=London|isbn=978-0-7100-0578-6|edition=3rd|url=http://art.yale.edu/file_columns/0000/1474/homo_ludens_johan_huizinga_routledge_1949_.pdf|accessdate=3 June 2015}}</ref> Play is not just a pastime activity; it has the potential to serve as an important tool in numerous aspects of daily life for adolescents, adults, and cognitively advanced non-human species (such as primates). Not only does play promote and aid in physical development (such as [[hand-eye coordination]]), but it also aids in cognitive development and social skills, and can even act as a stepping stone into the world of integration, which can be a very stressful process. Play is something that most children partake in, but the way play is executed is different between cultures and the way that children engage with play varies universally.\n\n== Definitions ==\nThe seminal text in the field of play studies is the book ''[[Homo Ludens]]'' first published in 1944 with several subsequent editions, in which [[Johan Huizinga]] defines play as follows:<ref name=Huizinga/>{{rp|13}}\n{{quote|\"Summing up the formal characteristic of play, we might call it a free activity standing quite consciously outside 'ordinary' life as being 'not serious' but at the same time absorbing the player intensely and utterly. It is an activity connected with no material interest, and no profit can be gained by it. It proceeds within its own proper boundaries of time and space according to fixed rules and in an orderly manner. It promotes the formation of social groupings that tend to surround themselves with secrecy and to stress the difference from the common world by disguise or other means.\"}}\n\nThis definition of play as constituting a separate and independent sphere of human activity is sometimes referred to as the \"magic circle\" notion of play, a phrase also attributed to Huizinga.<ref name=Huizinga/> Many other definitions exist. Jean Piaget stated, \"the many theories of play expounded in the past are clear proof that the phenomenon is difficult to understand.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Piaget|first1=Jean|title=Play, dreams and imitation|date=1962|publisher=Norton|location=New York|page=147|volume= 24}}</ref>\n\nThere are multiple aspects of play people home in on when defining it. One definition from Susanna Millar's ''The Psychology of Play'' defines play as: \u201cany purposeful mental or physical activity performed either individually or group-wise in leisure time or at work for enjoyment, relaxation, and satisfaction of real-time or long term needs.\u201d{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}  This definition particularly emphasizes the conditions and benefits to be gained under certain actions or activities related to play. Other definitions may focus on play as an activity that must follow certain characteristics including willingness to engage, uncertainty of the outcome, and productivity of the activity to society.\n\nAnother definition of play from the twenty-first century comes from the National Playing Fields Association (NPFA). The definition reads as follows: \u201cplay is freely chosen, personally directed, intrinsically motivated behaviour that actively engages the child.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.playengland.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/best-play.pdf|website=www.playengland.net|title=Best Play: What Play Provision Should Do For Children|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref> This definition focuses more on the child's freedom of choice and personal motivation related to an activity.\n\n==Forms==\n[[File:July 4th Traditions (7188250241).jpg|thumbnail|People having fun]]\nPlay can take the form of improvisation or pretense, interactive, performance, mimicry, games, sports, and thrill-seeking, such as extreme or dangerous sports (sky-diving, high-speed racing, etc.). Philosopher [[Roger Caillois]] wrote about play in his 1961 book ''[[Man, Play and Games]]'' and [[Stephen Nachmanovitch]] expanded on these concepts in his 1990 book ''Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art''.<ref>Nachmanovitch, Stephen, ''Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art''. Tarcher/Penguin 1990.</ref> Nachmanovitch writes that:\n\n{{quote| Improvisation, composition, writing, painting, theater, invention, all creative acts are forms of play, the starting place of creativity in the human growth cycle, and one of the great primal life functions. Without play, learning and evolution are impossible. Play is the taproot from which original art springs; it is the raw stuff that the artist channels and organizes with all his learning and technique. (Free Play, p. 42) }}\n\nFree play gives children the freedom to decide what they want to play and how it will be played. Both the activity and the rules are subject to change in this form, and children can make any changes to the rules or objectives of the play at any time.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite journal|journal=International Journal of Early Years Education|volume=26|issue=4|pages=335\u2013339|doi=10.1080/09669760.2018.1527278|title=The play's the thing|year=2018|last1=Murray|first1=Jane|doi-access=free}}</ref> Some countries in the twenty-first century have added emphasis of free play into their values for children in early childhood such as Taiwan and Hungary.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nStructured play has clearly defined [[objective (goal)|goals]] and rules and such play is called a \"[[game]]\". Other play is unstructured or open-ended. Both types of play promote adaptive behaviors and mental states of [[happiness]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n[[Sports]] with defined rules will take place within designated play spaces, such as sports fields where, in [[Soccer]] for example, players kick a ball in a certain direction and push opponents out of their way as they do so. While appropriate within the sport's play space, these same behaviors might be inappropriate or even illegal outside the playing field.<ref name=Huizinga/>\n\nOther designed play spaces can be [[playgrounds]] with dedicated equipment and structures to promote active and social play. Some play spaces go even farther in specialization to bring the play indoors and will often charge admission as seen at [[Children's Museums]], [[Science museums|Science Centers]], or [[Family entertainment center|Family Entertainment Centers]]. Family Entertainment Centers (or Play Zones) are typically [[Business|For-Profit]] businesses purely for play and entertainment, while Children's Museums and Science Centers are typically [[Non-Profit]] organizations for educational entertainment.\n\nThe California-based National Institute for Play describes seven play patterns:<ref name=\"nifplay\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nifplay.org/science/pattern-play/ |title=The Science \u2013 Patterns of Play|author=National Institute for Play |accessdate=2014-07-25}}</ref>\n# '''Attunement play''', which establishes a connection, such as between newborn and mother.\n# '''Body play''', in which an infant explores the ways in which his or her body works and interacts with the world, such as making funny sounds or discovering what happens in a fall.\n# '''Object play''', such as playing with toys, banging pots and pans, handling physical things in ways that use curiosity.\n# '''Social play''', play which involves others in activities such as tumbling, making faces, and building connections with another child or group of children.\n# '''Imaginative or pretend play''', in which a child invents scenarios from his or her imagination and acts within them as a form of play, such as princess or pirate play.\n# '''Storytelling play''', the play of learning and language that develops intellect, such as a parent reading aloud to a child, or a child retelling the story in his or her own words.\n# '''Creative play''', by which one plays with imagination to transcend what is known in the current state, to create a higher state. For example, a person might experiment to find a new way to use a musical instrument, thereby taking that form of music to a higher plane; or, as Einstein was known to do, a person might wonder about things which are not yet known and play with unproven ideas as a bridge to the discovery of new knowledge.\n\nSeparate from self-initiated play, [[play therapy]] is used as a clinical application of play aimed at treating children who suffer from trauma, emotional issues and other problems.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dr. Toy's Smart Play Smart Toys (How To Raise A Child With a High PQ (Play Quotient)) |publisher=Stevanne Auerbach |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-56767-652-5}}</ref>\n\n==Children==\n{{see|Children's games|Children's street culture|Make believe|Street games}}In young children, play is frequently associated with [[cognitive development]] and [[socialization]].

In the colonial era, toys were makeshift and children taught each other very simple games with little adult supervision. The market economy of the 19th century enabled the modern concept of childhood as a distinct, happy life stage. Factory-made dolls and doll houses delighted young girls. Organized sports filtered down from adults and colleges, and boys learned to play with a bat, a ball and an impromptu playing field. In the 20th century, teenagers were increasingly organized into club sports supervised and coached by adults, with swimming taught at [[summer camp]]s and through supervised playgrounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://somervillearchives.omeka.net/exhibits/show/recreation1|title=What Park Did You Hang Out At?|first=Stephanie|last=Warner}}</ref> Under the [[New Deal]]'s [[Works Progress Administration]], thousands of local playgrounds and ball fields opened, promoting softball especially as a sport for all ages and both sexes.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} By the 21st century, Chudacoff notes, the old tension between parental controls and a child's individual freedom was being played out in [[cyberspace]].<ref>Chudacoff, Howard, ''Children at Play: An American History'' (2008).

Parents in the Mayan culture do interact with their children in a playful mindset while parents in the United States tend to set aside time to play and teach their children through games and activities.

Animals are often injured during play, become distracted from predators, and expend valuable energy. In rare cases, play has even been observed between different species that are natural enemies such as a [[polar bear]] and a [[dog]].<ref>[http://www.ted.com/talks/stuart_brown_says_play_is_more_than_fun_it_s_vital.html \"Stuart Brown says play is more than fun,\"] TED talks</ref> Yet play seems to be a normal activity with animals who occupy the higher strata of their own hierarchy of needs. Animals on the lower strata, e.g. stressed and starving animals, generally do not play.<ref name=NYT/> However, in wild [[Assamese macaque]]s physically active play is performed also during periods of low food availability and even if it is at the expense of growth, which strongly highlights the developmental and evolutionary importance of play.<ref name = \"Bergh\u00e4nel\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bergh\u00e4nel | first1 = A. | last2 = Sch\u00fclke | first2 = O. | last3 = Ostner | first3 = J. | year = 2015 | title = Locomotor play drives motor skill acquisition at the expense of growth: A life history trade-off | url = | journal = Science Advances | volume = 1 | issue = 7| pages = 1\u20138 | doi = 10.1126/sciadv.1500451 | pmid = 26601237 | pmc = 4643810 }}</ref>\n\nThe social cognitive complexity of numerous species, including dogs, have recently been explored in experimental studies. In one such study, conducted by Alexandra Horowitz of the University of California, the communication and attention-getting skills of dogs were investigated. In a natural setting, dyadic play behavior was observed; head-direction and posture was specifically noted. When one of the two dogs was facing away or otherwise preoccupied, attention-getting behaviors and signals (nudging, barking, growling, pawing, jumping, etc.) were used by the other dog to communicate the intent and/or desire to continue on with the dyadic play. Stronger or more frequent signaling was used if the attention of the other dog was not captured. These observations tell us that these dogs know how play behavior and signaling can be used to capture attention, communicate intent and desire, and manipulate one another. This characteristic and skill, called the \"attention-getting skill\" has generally only been seen in humans, but is now being researched and seen in many different species.\n\nObserving play behavior in various species can tell us a lot about the player's environment (including the welfare of the animal), personal needs, social rank (if any), immediate relationships, and eligibility for mating. Play activity, often observed through action and signals, often serves as a tool for communication and expression. Through mimicry, chasing, biting, and touching, animals will often act out in ways so as to send messages to one another; whether it's an alert, initiation of play, or expressing intent. When play behavior was observed for a study in [[Tonkean macaque]]s, it was discovered that play signals weren't always used to initiate play; rather, these signals were viewed primarily as methods of communication (sharing information and attention-getting). [[File:Jack Russell Terrier Eddi at the beach.JPG|right|thumb|A [[dog]] plays with a [[ball]].]]\n\nOne theory \u2013 \"play as preparation\" \u2013 was inspired by the observation that play often mimics adult themes of survival. [[Predator]]s such as [[lion]]s and [[bear]]s play by chasing, pouncing, pawing, wrestling, and biting, as they learn to stalk and kill prey. Prey animals such as [[deer]] and [[zebra]]s play by running and leaping as they acquire speed and agility. Hoofed mammals also practice kicking their hind legs to learn to ward off attacks. Indeed, time spent in physical play accelerates motor skill acquisition in wild [[Assamese macaque]]s.<ref name=\"Bergh\u00e4nel\" /> While mimicking adult behavior, attacking actions such as kicking and biting are not completely fulfilled, so playmates do not generally injure each other. In social animals, playing might also help to establish dominance rankings among the young to avoid conflicts as adults.<ref name=NYT/>\n\nJohn Byers, a zoologist at the [[University of Idaho]], discovered that the amount of time spent at play for many mammals (e.g. rats and cats) peaks around puberty, and then drops off. This corresponds to the development of the [[cerebellum]], suggesting that play is not so much about practicing ''exact'' behaviors, as much as building general connections in the brain. Sergio Pellis and colleagues at the [[University of Lethbridge]] in Alberta, Canada, discovered that play may shape the brain in other ways, too. Young mammals have an overabundance of brain cells in their cerebrum (the outer areas of the brain&nbsp;\u2013 part of what distinguishes mammals). There is evidence that play helps the brain clean up this excess of cells, resulting in a more efficient cerebrum at maturity.<ref name=NYT/>{{Multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| align = top\n| header = Humans and non-human animals playing in water\n| width1 = 306\n| image1 = Porto Covo July 2011-1.jpg\n| caption1 = Playing in the surf is among the favorite activities of children at the beach\n| width2 = 142\n| image2 = Dolphinsurfresize.jpg\n| caption2 = Dolphins playing in the surf\n}}\n\nMarc Bekoff (a [[University of Colorado]] evolutionary biologist) proposes a \"flexibility\" hypothesis that attempts to incorporate these newer neurological findings. It argues that play helps animals learn to switch and improvise all behaviors more effectively, to be prepared for the unexpected. There may, however, be other ways to acquire even these benefits of play: the concept of [[equifinality]]. The idea is that the social benefits of play for many animals, for example, could instead be garnered by grooming. Patrick Bateson maintains that equifinality is exactly what play teaches. In accordance with the flexibility hypothesis, play may teach animals to avoid \"false endpoints\". In other words, they will harness the childlike tendency to keep playing with something that works \"well enough\", eventually allowing them to come up with something that might work better, if only in some situations. This also allows mammals to build up various skills that could come in handy in entirely novel situations.<ref name=NYT/> A study on two species of monkeys ''Semnopithecus entellus'' and ''Macaca mulatta'' that came into association with each other during food provisioning by pilgrims at the Ambagarh Forest Reserve, near Jaipur, India, shows the interspecific interaction that developed between the juveniles of the two species when opportunity presented itself.<ref>B.

Some of the earliest studies of play started in the 1890s with [[G. Stanley Hall]], the father of the child study movement that sparked an interest in the developmental, mental and behavioral world of babies and children. Play also promotes healthy development of parent-child bonds, establishing social, emotional and cognitive developmental milestones that help them relate to others, manage stress, and learn resiliency.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ginsburg|first1=K.R.|year=2007|title=The Importance of Play in Promoting Healthy Child Development and Maintaining Strong Parent-Child Bonds|journal=Pediatrics|volume=119|issue=1|pages=182\u2013191|doi=10.1542/peds.2006-2697|pmid=17200287|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Genius of Play: Celebrating the Spirit of Childhood|author=Jenkinson, Sally|publisher=Hawthorn Press|year=2001|isbn=978-1-903458-04-4|location=Melbourne}}</ref>\n\nModern research in the field of [[affective neuroscience]] (the neural mechanisms of emotion) has uncovered important links between role play and neurogenesis in the brain.<ref>Panksepp, ''Affective Neuroscience 98''</ref> For example, researcher [[Roger Caillois]] used the word ''[[ilinx]]'' to describe the momentary disruption of perception that comes from forms of physical play that disorient the senses, especially balance.\n\nStudies have found that play and coping to daily stressors to be positively correlated in children.<ref>Goldstein & Russ, 2000\u20132001</ref><ref>Campos, Frankel, & Camras, 2004</ref> By playing, children regulate their emotions and this is important for adaptive functioning because without regulation, emotions could be overwhelming and stressful.\n\nEvolutionary psychologists have begun to explore the [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] relationship between higher intelligence in humans and its relationship to play, i.e., the relationship of play to the progress of whole evolutionary groups as opposed to the psychological implications of play to a specific individual.\n\n=== Physical, mental and social ===\nVarious forms of play, whether it is physical or mental, have influenced cognitive abilities in individuals.

The results of the study had statistical significance. There were improvements in math by 3.4% and general improvements in recall memory by 4% among the participants of the study.<ref name=\"cognitive:1\" />\n\nOn the other hand, other research has focused on the cognitive effects of mentally stimulating play. Playing video games is one of the most common mediums of play for children and adults today. There has been mixed reviews on the effects of video games. Despite this, according to a research conducted by Hollis (2014),\n\"[playing video games] was positively associated with skills strongly related to academic success, such as time management, attention, executive control, memory, and spatial abilities \u2013 when playing [[video game]] occurs in moderation\".<ref>[http://search.proquest.com/docview/1620743598 Hollis, S.

Much of the research focuses on the influence play has on child social development. There are different forms of play that have been noted to influence child social development. One study conducted by (Sullivan, 2003) explores the influence of playing styles with mothers versus playing styles with fathers and how it influences child social development. This article explains that \"integral to positive development is the child's social competence or, more precisely, the ability to regulate their own emotions and behaviors in the social contexts of early childhood to support the effective accomplishment of relevant developmental tasks.<ref>Sinclair, J. et al.

Having play time with parents that involves socially acceptable behaviour makes it easier for children to relate to be more socially adjusted to peers at school or at play<ref name=\"social:4\" /> Social development involving child interaction with peers is thus an area of influence for playful interactions with parents and peers.\n\n=== Play in educational practices ===\n\n==== Anji play ====\nAnji play \u5b89\u5409\u6e38\u620f in simplified Chinese \u5b89\u5409\u904a\u6232 in traditional Chinese is an educational method based on children's self-directed play in outside spaces, using simple tools made of natural material. The teachers and instructors only observe and document the children's independent play. The method was created by Cheng Xueqin and is organized in two hours of free play when the children choose the available material they want to use and build structures to play.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.euronews.com/2016/08/10/child-s-play-preparations-for-future-success|title=Child's play preparations for future success|last=Euronews|date=2016-08-10|website=www.euronews.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status= |access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref>\n\nWhile planning, experimenting, building and using the structures to play, the children have the opportunity to interact with peers, to think critically about what may work, to discuss the plan and organize the construction hard work. The process is observed and recorded by the teachers and instructors without intervention, even in instances of possible risk.\n\nBefore and after the two hours of play, the children have the opportunity to express their plans and discuss with their peers. After the play, they get the opportunity to draw, write or explain what they did. Then, they watch the videos recorded the same day and explain how they played and comment on each other's creations.\n\nAnji play is also called \u201ctrue play\u201d and its guiding principles are love, risk, joy, engagement, and reflection. This method of self-initiated and self-directed play is applied at the pre-schools (to children from 3 to 6 years-old) in Anji county, East China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@AnjiPlay/how-did-anji-play-go-global-18e1e4bca996|title=How Did \"Anji Play\" Go Global?|last=Coffino|first=Jesse|date=2017-03-20|website=jesse coffino|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Caillois, R.

(1990). ''Play''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.</ref> Play is commonly associated with children and juvenile-level activities, but play occurs at any life stage, and among other higher-functioning animals as well, most notably [[mammals]].\n\nMany prominent researchers in the field of psychology, including [[Melanie Klein]], [[Jean Piaget]], [[William James]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Carl Jung]] and [[Lev Vygotsky]] have viewed play as confined to the human species, believing play was important for human development and using different research methods to prove their theories.\n\nPlay is often interpreted as frivolous; yet the player can be intently focused on their objective, particularly when play is structured and goal-oriented, as in a [[game]]. Accordingly, play can range from relaxed, free-spirited and spontaneous through frivolous to planned or even compulsive.<ref name=Huizinga>{{cite book|last1=Huizinga|first1=J|title=Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play Element in Culture|date=1980|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd.|location=London|isbn=978-0-7100-0578-6|edition=3rd|url=http://art.yale.edu/file_columns/0000/1474/homo_ludens_johan_huizinga_routledge_1949_.pdf|accessdate=3 June 2015}}</ref> Play is not just a pastime activity; it has the potential to serve as an important tool in numerous aspects of daily life for adolescents, adults, and cognitively advanced non-human species (such as primates). Not only does play promote and aid in physical development (such as [[hand-eye coordination]]), but it also aids in cognitive development and social skills, and can even act as a stepping stone into the world of integration, which can be a very stressful process. Play is something that most children partake in, but the way play is executed is different between cultures and the way that children engage with play varies universally.\n\n== Definitions ==\nThe seminal text in the field of play studies is the book ''[[Homo Ludens]]'' first published in 1944 with several subsequent editions, in which [[Johan Huizinga]] defines play as follows:<ref name=Huizinga/>{{rp|13}}\n{{quote|\"Summing up the formal characteristic of play, we might call it a free activity standing quite consciously outside 'ordinary' life as being 'not serious' but at the same time absorbing the player intensely and utterly. It is an activity connected with no material interest, and no profit can be gained by it. It proceeds within its own proper boundaries of time and space according to fixed rules and in an orderly manner. It promotes the formation of social groupings that tend to surround themselves with secrecy and to stress the difference from the common world by disguise or other means.\"}}\n\nThis definition of play as constituting a separate and independent sphere of human activity is sometimes referred to as the \"magic circle\" notion of play, a phrase also attributed to Huizinga.<ref name=Huizinga/> Many other definitions exist. Jean Piaget stated, \"the many theories of play expounded in the past are clear proof that the phenomenon is difficult to understand.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Piaget|first1=Jean|title=Play, dreams and imitation|date=1962|publisher=Norton|location=New York|page=147|volume= 24}}</ref>\n\nThere are multiple aspects of play people home in on when defining it. One definition from Susanna Millar's ''The Psychology of Play'' defines play as: \u201cany purposeful mental or physical activity performed either individually or group-wise in leisure time or at work for enjoyment, relaxation, and satisfaction of real-time or long term needs.\u201d{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}  This definition particularly emphasizes the conditions and benefits to be gained under certain actions or activities related to play. Other definitions may focus on play as an activity that must follow certain characteristics including willingness to engage, uncertainty of the outcome, and productivity of the activity to society.\n\nAnother definition of play from the twenty-first century comes from the National Playing Fields Association (NPFA). The definition reads as follows: \u201cplay is freely chosen, personally directed, intrinsically motivated behaviour that actively engages the child.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.playengland.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/best-play.pdf|website=www.playengland.net|title=Best Play: What Play Provision Should Do For Children|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref> This definition focuses more on the child's freedom of choice and personal motivation related to an activity.\n\n==Forms==\n[[File:July 4th Traditions (7188250241).jpg|thumbnail|People having fun]]\nPlay can take the form of improvisation or pretense, interactive, performance, mimicry, games, sports, and thrill-seeking, such as extreme or dangerous sports (sky-diving, high-speed racing, etc.). Philosopher [[Roger Caillois]] wrote about play in his 1961 book ''[[Man, Play and Games]]'' and [[Stephen Nachmanovitch]] expanded on these concepts in his 1990 book ''Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art''.<ref>Nachmanovitch, Stephen, ''Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art''. Tarcher/Penguin 1990.</ref> Nachmanovitch writes that:\n\n{{quote| Improvisation, composition, writing, painting, theater, invention, all creative acts are forms of play, the starting place of creativity in the human growth cycle, and one of the great primal life functions. Without play, learning and evolution are impossible. Play is the taproot from which original art springs; it is the raw stuff that the artist channels and organizes with all his learning and technique. (Free Play, p. 42) }}\n\nFree play gives children the freedom to decide what they want to play and how it will be played. Both the activity and the rules are subject to change in this form, and children can make any changes to the rules or objectives of the play at any time.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite journal|journal=International Journal of Early Years Education|volume=26|issue=4|pages=335\u2013339|doi=10.1080/09669760.2018.1527278|title=The play's the thing|year=2018|last1=Murray|first1=Jane|doi-access=free}}</ref> Some countries in the twenty-first century have added emphasis of free play into their values for children in early childhood such as Taiwan and Hungary.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nStructured play has clearly defined [[objective (goal)|goals]] and rules and such play is called a \"[[game]]\". Other play is unstructured or open-ended. Both types of play promote adaptive behaviors and mental states of [[happiness]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n[[Sports]] with defined rules will take place within designated play spaces, such as sports fields where, in [[Soccer]] for example, players kick a ball in a certain direction and push opponents out of their way as they do so. While appropriate within the sport's play space, these same behaviors might be inappropriate or even illegal outside the playing field.<ref name=Huizinga/>\n\nOther designed play spaces can be [[playgrounds]] with dedicated equipment and structures to promote active and social play. Some play spaces go even farther in specialization to bring the play indoors and will often charge admission as seen at [[Children's Museums]], [[Science museums|Science Centers]], or [[Family entertainment center|Family Entertainment Centers]]. Family Entertainment Centers (or Play Zones) are typically [[Business|For-Profit]] businesses purely for play and entertainment, while Children's Museums and Science Centers are typically [[Non-Profit]] organizations for educational entertainment.\n\nThe California-based National Institute for Play describes seven play patterns:<ref name=\"nifplay\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nifplay.org/science/pattern-play/ |title=The Science \u2013 Patterns of Play|author=National Institute for Play |accessdate=2014-07-25}}</ref>\n# '''Attunement play''', which establishes a connection, such as between newborn and mother.\n# '''Body play''', in which an infant explores the ways in which his or her body works and interacts with the world, such as making funny sounds or discovering what happens in a fall.\n# '''Object play''', such as playing with toys, banging pots and pans, handling physical things in ways that use curiosity.\n# '''Social play''', play which involves others in activities such as tumbling, making faces, and building connections with another child or group of children.\n# '''Imaginative or pretend play''', in which a child invents scenarios from his or her imagination and acts within them as a form of play, such as princess or pirate play.\n# '''Storytelling play''', the play of learning and language that develops intellect, such as a parent reading aloud to a child, or a child retelling the story in his or her own words.\n# '''Creative play''', by which one plays with imagination to transcend what is known in the current state, to create a higher state. For example, a person might experiment to find a new way to use a musical instrument, thereby taking that form of music to a higher plane; or, as Einstein was known to do, a person might wonder about things which are not yet known and play with unproven ideas as a bridge to the discovery of new knowledge.\n\nSeparate from self-initiated play, [[play therapy]] is used as a clinical application of play aimed at treating children who suffer from trauma, emotional issues and other problems.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dr. Toy's Smart Play Smart Toys (How To Raise A Child With a High PQ (Play Quotient)) |publisher=Stevanne Auerbach |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-56767-652-5}}</ref>\n\n==Children==\n{{see|Children's games|Children's street culture|Make believe|Street games}}In young children, play is frequently associated with [[cognitive development]] and [[socialization]].

''The Ambiguity of Play''. Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press</ref> Modern findings in [[neuroscience]] suggest that play promotes flexibility of mind, including adaptive practices such as discovering multiple ways to achieve a desired result, or creative ways to improve or reorganize a given situation (Millar, 1967; Shonkoff & Phillips, 2000).{{full citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n[[File:Sandbox Lawn Jam Our Community Place Harrisonburg VA June 2008.jpg|thumb|Children playing in a sandbox]]As children get older, they engage in board games, video games and computer play, and in this context the word [[gameplay]] is used to describe the concept and theory of play and its relationship to rules and game design.

In the colonial era, toys were makeshift and children taught each other very simple games with little adult supervision. The market economy of the 19th century enabled the modern concept of childhood as a distinct, happy life stage. Factory-made dolls and doll houses delighted young girls. Organized sports filtered down from adults and colleges, and boys learned to play with a bat, a ball and an impromptu playing field. In the 20th century, teenagers were increasingly organized into club sports supervised and coached by adults, with swimming taught at [[summer camp]]s and through supervised playgrounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://somervillearchives.omeka.net/exhibits/show/recreation1|title=What Park Did You Hang Out At?|first=Stephanie|last=Warner}}</ref> Under the [[New Deal]]'s [[Works Progress Administration]], thousands of local playgrounds and ball fields opened, promoting softball especially as a sport for all ages and both sexes.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} By the 21st century, Chudacoff notes, the old tension between parental controls and a child's individual freedom was being played out in [[cyberspace]].<ref>Chudacoff, Howard, ''Children at Play: An American History'' (2008).

Parents in the Mayan culture do interact with their children in a playful mindset while parents in the United States tend to set aside time to play and teach their children through games and activities.

Animals are often injured during play, become distracted from predators, and expend valuable energy. In rare cases, play has even been observed between different species that are natural enemies such as a [[polar bear]] and a [[dog]].<ref>[http://www.ted.com/talks/stuart_brown_says_play_is_more_than_fun_it_s_vital.html \"Stuart Brown says play is more than fun,\"] TED talks</ref> Yet play seems to be a normal activity with animals who occupy the higher strata of their own hierarchy of needs. Animals on the lower strata, e.g. stressed and starving animals, generally do not play.<ref name=NYT/> However, in wild [[Assamese macaque]]s physically active play is performed also during periods of low food availability and even if it is at the expense of growth, which strongly highlights the developmental and evolutionary importance of play.<ref name = \"Bergh\u00e4nel\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bergh\u00e4nel | first1 = A. | last2 = Sch\u00fclke | first2 = O. | last3 = Ostner | first3 = J. | year = 2015 | title = Locomotor play drives motor skill acquisition at the expense of growth: A life history trade-off | url = | journal = Science Advances | volume = 1 | issue = 7| pages = 1\u20138 | doi = 10.1126/sciadv.1500451 | pmid = 26601237 | pmc = 4643810 }}</ref>\n\nThe social cognitive complexity of numerous species, including dogs, have recently been explored in experimental studies. In one such study, conducted by Alexandra Horowitz of the University of California, the communication and attention-getting skills of dogs were investigated. In a natural setting, dyadic play behavior was observed; head-direction and posture was specifically noted. When one of the two dogs was facing away or otherwise preoccupied, attention-getting behaviors and signals (nudging, barking, growling, pawing, jumping, etc.) were used by the other dog to communicate the intent and/or desire to continue on with the dyadic play. Stronger or more frequent signaling was used if the attention of the other dog was not captured. These observations tell us that these dogs know how play behavior and signaling can be used to capture attention, communicate intent and desire, and manipulate one another. This characteristic and skill, called the \"attention-getting skill\" has generally only been seen in humans, but is now being researched and seen in many different species.\n\nObserving play behavior in various species can tell us a lot about the player's environment (including the welfare of the animal), personal needs, social rank (if any), immediate relationships, and eligibility for mating. Play activity, often observed through action and signals, often serves as a tool for communication and expression. Through mimicry, chasing, biting, and touching, animals will often act out in ways so as to send messages to one another; whether it's an alert, initiation of play, or expressing intent. When play behavior was observed for a study in [[Tonkean macaque]]s, it was discovered that play signals weren't always used to initiate play; rather, these signals were viewed primarily as methods of communication (sharing information and attention-getting). [[File:Jack Russell Terrier Eddi at the beach.JPG|right|thumb|A [[dog]] plays with a [[ball]].]]\n\nOne theory \u2013 \"play as preparation\" \u2013 was inspired by the observation that play often mimics adult themes of survival. [[Predator]]s such as [[lion]]s and [[bear]]s play by chasing, pouncing, pawing, wrestling, and biting, as they learn to stalk and kill prey. Prey animals such as [[deer]] and [[zebra]]s play by running and leaping as they acquire speed and agility. Hoofed mammals also practice kicking their hind legs to learn to ward off attacks. Indeed, time spent in physical play accelerates motor skill acquisition in wild [[Assamese macaque]]s.<ref name=\"Bergh\u00e4nel\" /> While mimicking adult behavior, attacking actions such as kicking and biting are not completely fulfilled, so playmates do not generally injure each other. In social animals, playing might also help to establish dominance rankings among the young to avoid conflicts as adults.<ref name=NYT/>\n\nJohn Byers, a zoologist at the [[University of Idaho]], discovered that the amount of time spent at play for many mammals (e.g. rats and cats) peaks around puberty, and then drops off. This corresponds to the development of the [[cerebellum]], suggesting that play is not so much about practicing ''exact'' behaviors, as much as building general connections in the brain. Sergio Pellis and colleagues at the [[University of Lethbridge]] in Alberta, Canada, discovered that play may shape the brain in other ways, too. Young mammals have an overabundance of brain cells in their cerebrum (the outer areas of the brain&nbsp;\u2013 part of what distinguishes mammals). There is evidence that play helps the brain clean up this excess of cells, resulting in a more efficient cerebrum at maturity.<ref name=NYT/>{{Multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| align = top\n| header = Humans and non-human animals playing in water\n| width1 = 306\n| image1 = Porto Covo July 2011-1.jpg\n| caption1 = Playing in the surf is among the favorite activities of children at the beach\n| width2 = 142\n| image2 = Dolphinsurfresize.jpg\n| caption2 = Dolphins playing in the surf\n}}\n\nMarc Bekoff (a [[University of Colorado]] evolutionary biologist) proposes a \"flexibility\" hypothesis that attempts to incorporate these newer neurological findings. It argues that play helps animals learn to switch and improvise all behaviors more effectively, to be prepared for the unexpected. There may, however, be other ways to acquire even these benefits of play: the concept of [[equifinality]]. The idea is that the social benefits of play for many animals, for example, could instead be garnered by grooming. Patrick Bateson maintains that equifinality is exactly what play teaches. In accordance with the flexibility hypothesis, play may teach animals to avoid \"false endpoints\". In other words, they will harness the childlike tendency to keep playing with something that works \"well enough\", eventually allowing them to come up with something that might work better, if only in some situations. This also allows mammals to build up various skills that could come in handy in entirely novel situations.<ref name=NYT/> A study on two species of monkeys ''Semnopithecus entellus'' and ''Macaca mulatta'' that came into association with each other during food provisioning by pilgrims at the Ambagarh Forest Reserve, near Jaipur, India, shows the interspecific interaction that developed between the juveniles of the two species when opportunity presented itself.<ref>B.

Some of the earliest studies of play started in the 1890s with [[G. Stanley Hall]], the father of the child study movement that sparked an interest in the developmental, mental and behavioral world of babies and children. Play also promotes healthy development of parent-child bonds, establishing social, emotional and cognitive developmental milestones that help them relate to others, manage stress, and learn resiliency.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ginsburg|first1=K.R.|year=2007|title=The Importance of Play in Promoting Healthy Child Development and Maintaining Strong Parent-Child Bonds|journal=Pediatrics|volume=119|issue=1|pages=182\u2013191|doi=10.1542/peds.2006-2697|pmid=17200287|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Genius of Play: Celebrating the Spirit of Childhood|author=Jenkinson, Sally|publisher=Hawthorn Press|year=2001|isbn=978-1-903458-04-4|location=Melbourne}}</ref>\n\nModern research in the field of [[affective neuroscience]] (the neural mechanisms of emotion) has uncovered important links between role play and neurogenesis in the brain.<ref>Panksepp, ''Affective Neuroscience 98''</ref> For example, researcher [[Roger Caillois]] used the word ''[[ilinx]]'' to describe the momentary disruption of perception that comes from forms of physical play that disorient the senses, especially balance.\n\nStudies have found that play and coping to daily stressors to be positively correlated in children.<ref>Goldstein & Russ, 2000\u20132001</ref><ref>Campos, Frankel, & Camras, 2004</ref> By playing, children regulate their emotions and this is important for adaptive functioning because without regulation, emotions could be overwhelming and stressful.\n\nEvolutionary psychologists have begun to explore the [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] relationship between higher intelligence in humans and its relationship to play, i.e., the relationship of play to the progress of whole evolutionary groups as opposed to the psychological implications of play to a specific individual.\n\n=== Physical, mental and social ===\nVarious forms of play, whether it is physical or mental, have influenced cognitive abilities in individuals.

Much of the research focuses on the influence play has on child social development. There are different forms of play that have been noted to influence child social development. One study conducted by (Sullivan, 2003) explores the influence of playing styles with mothers versus playing styles with fathers and how it influences child social development. This article explains that \"integral to positive development is the child's social competence or, more precisely, the ability to regulate their own emotions and behaviors in the social contexts of early childhood to support the effective accomplishment of relevant developmental tasks.<ref>Sinclair, J. et al. (1995). Exergame development using the dual flow model. Proc. IE 2009, 1-7.</ref>\n\nSocial benefits of play have been measured using basic interpersonal values such as getting along with peers.<ref name=\"social:4\">Sullivan, C. (2003). [https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/2271/1/MQ83828.pdf The benefits of parent-child play for the social development of preschoolers with varying levels of anxiety problems]. ProQuest, UMI Dissertations.</ref> One of the social benefits that this researcher has uncovered is that play with parents has proven to reduce anxiety in children. Having play time with parents that involves socially acceptable behaviour makes it easier for children to relate to be more socially adjusted to peers at school or at play<ref name=\"social:4\" /> Social development involving child interaction with peers is thus an area of influence for playful interactions with parents and peers.\n\n=== Play in educational practices ===\n\n==== Anji play ====\nAnji play \u5b89\u5409\u6e38\u620f in simplified Chinese \u5b89\u5409\u904a\u6232 in traditional Chinese is an educational method based on children's self-directed play in outside spaces, using simple tools made of natural material. The teachers and instructors only observe and document the children's independent play. The method was created by Cheng Xueqin and is organized in two hours of free play when the children choose the available material they want to use and build structures to play.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.euronews.com/2016/08/10/child-s-play-preparations-for-future-success|title=Child's play preparations for future success|last=Euronews|date=2016-08-10|website=www.euronews.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status= |access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref>\n\nWhile planning, experimenting, building and using the structures to play, the children have the opportunity to interact with peers, to think critically about what may work, to discuss the plan and organize the construction hard work. The process is observed and recorded by the teachers and instructors without intervention, even in instances of possible risk.\n\nBefore and after the two hours of play, the children have the opportunity to express their plans and discuss with their peers. After the play, they get the opportunity to draw, write or explain what they did. Then, they watch the videos recorded the same day and explain how they played and comment on each other's creations.\n\nAnji play is also called \u201ctrue play\u201d and its guiding principles are love, risk, joy, engagement, and reflection. This method of self-initiated and self-directed play is applied at the pre-schools (to children from 3 to 6 years-old) in Anji county, East China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@AnjiPlay/how-did-anji-play-go-global-18e1e4bca996|title=How Did \"Anji Play\" Go Global?|last=Coffino|first=Jesse|date=2017-03-20|website=jesse coffino|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Caillois, R.

His father's name was Gisu.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\"/> After entering primary school he became close friends with the son of [[Ank\u014d Asato]], a karate and [[Jigen-ry\u016b]] master who would soon become his first karate teacher.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\"/> \n\u2212\t\nFunakoshi's family was stiffly opposed to the Meiji government's abolition of the Japanese [[Chonmage|topknot]], and this meant that he would be ineligible to pursue his goal of attending medical school (where topknots were banned), despite having passed the entrance examination.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\"/> Being trained in both classical Chinese and Japanese philosophies and teachings, Funakoshi became an assistant teacher in Okinawa. During this time, his relations with the Asato family grew and he began nightly travels to the Asato family residence to receive karate instruction from Ank\u014d Asato.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\"/>\n\n==Shotokan Karate==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}\nFunakoshi had trained in both of the popular styles of Okinawan [[karate]] of the time: [[Sh\u014drei-ry\u016b]] and [[Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b]]. Shotokan is named after Funakoshi's pen name, ''Sh\u014dt\u014d'' ([[wikt:\u677e|\u677e]][[wikt:\u6fe4|\u6fe4]]), which means \"waving pines\".  ''Kan'' means training hall or house, thus ''Sh\u014dt\u014dkan'' (\u677e\u6fe4\u9928) referred to the \"house of Sh\u014dt\u014d\". This name was coined by Funakoshi's students when they posted a sign above the entrance of the hall at which Funakoshi taught. In addition to being a karate master, Funakoshi was an avid [[poet]] and [[philosopher]] who would reportedly go for long walks in the forest where he would [[meditation|meditate]] and write his poetry.<ref name=\"threemasters\">John Stevens (1995). \"Three Budo Masters: Kano, Funakoshi, Ueshiba\". Kodansha International {{ISBN|4-7700-1852-5}}</ref>\n\nBy the late 1910s, Funakoshi had many students, of which a few were deemed capable of passing on their master's teachings. Continuing his effort to garner widespread interest in Okinawan karate, Funakoshi ventured to mainland Japan in 1917, and again in 1922.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\" />\n\nIn 1930, Funakoshi established an association named Dai-Nihon Karate-do Kenkyukai to promote communication and information exchange among people who study karate-d\u014d. In 1936, Dai-Nippon Karate-do Kenkyukai changed its name to Dai-Nippon Karate-do Shoto-kai.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.shotokai.jp/english/about/history.html |title=The Official Homepage of Nihon Karate-do Shotokai |access-date=2010-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227032101/http://www.shotokai.jp/english/about/history.html |archive-date=2010-02-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The association is known today as [[Shotokai]], and is the official keeper of Funakoshi's karate heritage.\n\nIn 1936, Funakoshi built the first Sh\u014dt\u014dkan ''[[dojo]]'' (training hall) in Tokyo. While on the Japanese mainland, he changed the [[kanji|written characters]]  of karate to mean \"empty hand\" (\u7a7a\u624b) instead of \"China hand\" (\u5510\u624b) (literally [[Tang dynasty]]) to downplay its connection to [[Chinese boxing]]. Karate had borrowed many aspects from Chinese boxing.  Funakoshi also argued in his autobiography that a philosophical evaluation of the use of \"empty\" seemed to fit as it implied a way which was not tethered to any other physical object.\n\nFunakoshi's re-interpretation of the [[kanji|character]] ''kara'' in karate to mean \"empty\" ([[wikt:\u7a7a|\u7a7a]]) rather than \"Chinese\" ([[wikt:\u5510|\u5510]])  caused some tension with traditionalists back in Okinawa, prompting Funakoshi to remain in [[Tokyo]] indefinitely.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} In 1949 Funakoshi's students created the [[Japan Karate Association]] (JKA), with Funakoshi as the honorary head of the organization. However, in practise this organization was led by [[Masatoshi Nakayama]]. The JKA began formalizing Funakoshi's teachings.\n\n==Illness and death==\nFunakoshi developed [[osteoarthritis]] in 1948, and died in April 26, 1957.\n\n==Legacy==\nFunakoshi published several books on karate including his autobiography, ''Karate-Do: My Way of Life''. His legacy, however, rests in a document containing his philosophies of karate training now referred to as the ''[[niju kun]]'', or \"twenty principles\".  These rules are the premise of training for all Shotokan practitioners and are published in a work titled ''The Twenty Guiding Principles of Karate''.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Twenty Guiding Principles of Karate: The Spiritual Legacy of the Master  | publisher=Kodansha International Ltd | author=Funakoshi, Gichin | translator=John Teramoto| year=1975 |isbn=4-7700-2796-6}}</ref> Within this book, Funakoshi lays out 20 rules by which students of karate are urged to abide in an effort to \"become better human beings\".<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\" /> Funakoshi's Karate-Do Kyohan \"The Master Text\" remains his most detailed publication, containing sections on history, basics, [[kata]], and [[kumite]].

From about eleven years old he began to study to-te jutsu under [[Azato Anko]] and [[Itosu Anko]]. He practiced diligently and in 1912 became the president of the Okinawan Shobukai. In May 1922, he relocated to Tokyo and became a professional teacher of karate-do. He devoted his entire life to the development of karate-do. He lived out his eighty-eight years of life and left this world on April 26, 1957. Reinterpreting to-te jutsu, the Sensei promulgated karate-do while not losing its original philosophy. Like bugei (classical martial arts), so too is the pinnacle of karate \u201cmu\u201d (enlightenment): to purify and make one empty through the transformation from \u201cjutsu\u201d to \u201cdo\u201d. Through his famous words \"\u7a7a\u624b\u306b\u5148\u624b\u306a\u3057\" (karate ni sente nashi) meaning ''There is no first attack in Karate'' and \u7a7a\u624b\u306f\u541b\u5b50\u306e\u6b66\u82b8

His father's name was Gisu.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\"/> After entering primary school he became close friends with the son of [[Ank\u014d Asato]], a karate and [[Jigen-ry\u016b]] master who would soon become his first karate teacher.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\"/> \n\u2212\t\nFunakoshi's family was stiffly opposed to the Meiji government's abolition of the Japanese [[Chonmage|topknot]], and this meant that he would be ineligible to pursue his goal of attending medical school (where topknots were banned), despite having passed the entrance examination.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\"/> Being trained in both classical Chinese and Japanese philosophies and teachings, Funakoshi became an assistant teacher in Okinawa. During this time, his relations with the Asato family grew and he began nightly travels to the Asato family residence to receive karate instruction from Ank\u014d Asato.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\"/>\n\n==Shotokan Karate==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}\nFunakoshi had trained in both of the popular styles of Okinawan [[karate]] of the time: [[Sh\u014drei-ry\u016b]] and [[Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b]]. Shotokan is named after Funakoshi's pen name, ''Sh\u014dt\u014d'' ([[wikt:\u677e|\u677e]][[wikt:\u6fe4|\u6fe4]]), which means \"waving pines\".  ''Kan'' means training hall or house, thus ''Sh\u014dt\u014dkan'' (\u677e\u6fe4\u9928) referred to the \"house of Sh\u014dt\u014d\". This name was coined by Funakoshi's students when they posted a sign above the entrance of the hall at which Funakoshi taught. In addition to being a karate master, Funakoshi was an avid [[poet]] and [[philosopher]] who would reportedly go for long walks in the forest where he would [[meditation|meditate]] and write his poetry.<ref name=\"threemasters\">John Stevens (1995). \"Three Budo Masters: Kano, Funakoshi, Ueshiba\". Kodansha International {{ISBN|4-7700-1852-5}}</ref>\n\nBy the late 1910s, Funakoshi had many students, of which a few were deemed capable of passing on their master's teachings. Continuing his effort to garner widespread interest in Okinawan karate, Funakoshi ventured to mainland Japan in 1917, and again in 1922.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\" />\n\nIn 1930, Funakoshi established an association named Dai-Nihon Karate-do Kenkyukai to promote communication and information exchange among people who study karate-d\u014d. In 1936, Dai-Nippon Karate-do Kenkyukai changed its name to Dai-Nippon Karate-do Shoto-kai.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.shotokai.jp/english/about/history.html |title=The Official Homepage of Nihon Karate-do Shotokai |access-date=2010-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227032101/http://www.shotokai.jp/english/about/history.html |archive-date=2010-02-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The association is known today as [[Shotokai]], and is the official keeper of Funakoshi's karate heritage.\n\nIn 1936, Funakoshi built the first Sh\u014dt\u014dkan ''[[dojo]]'' (training hall) in Tokyo. While on the Japanese mainland, he changed the [[kanji|written characters]]  of karate to mean \"empty hand\" (\u7a7a\u624b) instead of \"China hand\" (\u5510\u624b) (literally [[Tang dynasty]]) to downplay its connection to [[Chinese boxing]]. Karate had borrowed many aspects from Chinese boxing.  Funakoshi also argued in his autobiography that a philosophical evaluation of the use of \"empty\" seemed to fit as it implied a way which was not tethered to any other physical object.\n\nFunakoshi's re-interpretation of the [[kanji|character]] ''kara'' in karate to mean \"empty\" ([[wikt:\u7a7a|\u7a7a]]) rather than \"Chinese\" ([[wikt:\u5510|\u5510]])  caused some tension with traditionalists back in Okinawa, prompting Funakoshi to remain in [[Tokyo]] indefinitely.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} In 1949 Funakoshi's students created the [[Japan Karate Association]] (JKA), with Funakoshi as the honorary head of the organization. However, in practise this organization was led by [[Masatoshi Nakayama]]. The JKA began formalizing Funakoshi's teachings.\n\n==Illness and death==\nFunakoshi developed [[osteoarthritis]] in 1948, and died in April 26, 1957.\n\n==Legacy==\nFunakoshi published several books on karate including his autobiography, ''Karate-Do: My Way of Life''. His legacy, however, rests in a document containing his philosophies of karate training now referred to as the ''[[niju kun]]'', or \"twenty principles\".  These rules are the premise of training for all Shotokan practitioners and are published in a work titled ''The Twenty Guiding Principles of Karate''.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Twenty Guiding Principles of Karate: The Spiritual Legacy of the Master  | publisher=Kodansha International Ltd | author=Funakoshi, Gichin | translator=John Teramoto| year=1975 |isbn=4-7700-2796-6}}</ref> Within this book, Funakoshi lays out 20 rules by which students of karate are urged to abide in an effort to \"become better human beings\".<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\" /> Funakoshi's Karate-Do Kyohan \"The Master Text\" remains his most detailed publication, containing sections on history, basics, [[kata]], and [[kumite]].

From about eleven years old he began to study to-te jutsu under [[Azato Anko]] and [[Itosu Anko]]. He practiced diligently and in 1912 became the president of the Okinawan Shobukai. In May 1922, he relocated to Tokyo and became a professional teacher of karate-do. He devoted his entire life to the development of karate-do. He lived out his eighty-eight years of life and left this world on April 26, 1957. Reinterpreting to-te jutsu, the Sensei promulgated karate-do while not losing its original philosophy. Like bugei (classical martial arts), so too is the pinnacle of karate \u201cmu\u201d (enlightenment): to purify and make one empty through the transformation from \u201cjutsu\u201d to \u201cdo\u201d.

The [[Nationalist government]] started the process to takeover [[Taiwan]] on behalf of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. The '''Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office''' was established by the [[Executive Yuan]] in [[Chongqing|Chungking]] on September 1, 1945. The office moved to Taipei on October 25, 1945. After the [[February 28 incident]] in 1947, the [[Executive Yuan]] decided to restructure the Provincial Administrative Office as a provincial government. On May 16, 1947, the '''Taiwan Provincial Government''' was established.\n\nThe Republic of China progressively lost control of mainland China to Communist Party forces in the late 1940s and early 1950s and the national government relocated to Taiwan in 1950. However, Taiwan continued to be governed by a provincial government even though from 1955 it was one of only two provincial governments still functioning (the other being Fujian province, controlling some coastal islands). The remaining parts of Fujian province still under Republic of China control were placed under military administration 1956, and Fujian provincial government was downsized and relocated to Taiwan island. This left Taiwan province as the only fully functioning provincial government. From 1967, a number of major cities in Taiwan were elevated to special municipalities directly controlled by the national government, and moved outside the jurisdiction of Taiwan province.\n\nSince 1998, the provincial government has been downsized and its major functions transferred to the Executive Yuan of the central government. The [[County (Taiwan)|counties]] and [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|cities]] under the province are administered directly by the [[Government of the Republic of China|central government]] since then.\n\nIn July 2018, all of its remaining duties and functions were transferred to the [[National Development Council (Taiwan)|National Development Council]] and other ministries of the [[Executive Yuan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tpg.gov.tw/|title=Taiwan Provincial Government Official Website|accessdate=17 July 2018}}</ref> However, the position of the Chairman of the Provincial Government is retained to comply with [[Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China|the Constitution]].\n\n== Historical government buildings ==\nHistorically, before all its functionalities were handed to the [[Executive Yuan]] in July 2018. the provincial government was located in [[Taipei]] from 1947 to 1956, and in [[Zhongxing New Village]] from 1957 to July 2018.\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Order\n|width=400|'''First'''||width=400|'''Second'''\n|-\n!Location\n|Ch'\u00eang-chung, [[Taipei]] City<br><small>(now [[Zhongzheng District|Zhongzheng]], [[Taipei]])</small>\n|[[Zhongxing New Village]],<br>[[Nantou City]], [[Nantou County]]\n|-\n!Date in use\n|May 1947 to 1956||1957 to July 2018\n|-\n!Photo\n|[[File:Executive Yuan 20050703.jpg|300px]]||[[File:Taiwan the Province Government Building.JPG|300px]]\n|-\n!Notes\n|Currently the [[Executive Yuan]] building\n|Currently the Office of the Zhongxing New Village Revitalization Project, [[National Development Council (Taiwan)|National Development Council]]\n|}\n\n== Governor of Taiwan ==\n===Official titles of the governor===\n{|class=wikitable\n!rowspan=2|Year!!colspan=3|Full title!!rowspan=2|Literally!!rowspan=2 width=500|Notes\n|-\n![[Chinese character|Chinese]]!![[Taiwanese Mandarin|Mandarin]]<br>([[Pinyin]])!![[Taiwanese Hokkien|Hokkien]]<br>([[Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b]])\n|-\n|1945\u20131947||{{lang|zh-Hant|\u81fa\u7063\u7701<br>\u884c\u653f\u9577\u5b98}}||T\u00e1iw\u0101nsh\u011bng<br>X\u00edngzh\u00e8ng<br>Zh\u01cenggu\u0101n||T\u00e2i-o\u00e2n-s\u00e9ng<br>H\u00eang-ch\u00e8ng<br>Ti\u00f3ng-Kua\u207f\n|Chief Executive of<br>Taiwan Province||The position of Chief Executive was temporarily part of the [[Executive Yuan]], the position was legalized in ''Taiwan Provincial Administrative Executive Office Organizational Outline'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u81fa\u7063\u7701\u884c\u653f\u9577\u5b98\u516c\u7f72\u7d44\u7e54\u689d\u4f8b}} ''T\u00e1iw\u0101n-sh\u011bng x\u00edngzh\u00e8ng zh\u01cenggu\u0101n g\u014dngsh\u01d4 z\u01d4zh\u012b ti\u00e1ol\u00ec'') of September 20, 1945.\n|-\n|1947\u20131994||{{lang|zh-Hant|\u81fa\u7063\u7701\u653f\u5e9c<br>\u4e3b\u5e2d}}||T\u00e1iw\u0101nsh\u011bng<br>Zh\u00e8ngf\u01d4 Zh\u01d4x\u00ed||T\u00e2i-o\u00e2n-s\u00e9ng<br>Ch\u00e8ng-h\u00fa Ch\u00fa-se\u030dk\n|Chairman of Taiwan<br>Provincial Government||After the [[February 28 Incident]], the Administrative Executive Office was reformed to a provincial government.

The [[Nationalist government]] started the process to takeover [[Taiwan]] on behalf of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. The '''Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office''' was established by the [[Executive Yuan]] in [[Chongqing|Chungking]] on September 1, 1945. The office moved to Taipei on October 25, 1945. After the [[February 28 incident]] in 1947, the [[Executive Yuan]] decided to restructure the Provincial Administrative Office as a provincial government. On May 16, 1947, the '''Taiwan Provincial Government''' was established.\n\nThe Republic of China progressively lost control of mainland China to Communist Party forces in the late 1940s and early 1950s and the national government relocated to Taiwan in 1950. However, Taiwan continued to be governed by a provincial government even though from 1955 it was one of only two provincial governments still functioning (the other being Fujian province, controlling some coastal islands). The remaining parts of Fujian province still under Republic of China control were placed under military administration 1956, and Fujian provincial government was downsized and relocated to Taiwan island. This left Taiwan province as the only fully functioning provincial government. From 1967, a number of major cities in Taiwan were elevated to special municipalities directly controlled by the national government, and moved outside the jurisdiction of Taiwan province.\n\nSince 1998, the provincial government has been downsized and its major functions transferred to the Executive Yuan of the central government. The [[County (Taiwan)|counties]] and [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|cities]] under the province are administered directly by the [[Government of the Republic of China|central government]] since then.\n\nIn July 2018, all of its remaining duties and functions were transferred to the [[National Development Council (Taiwan)|National Development Council]] and other ministries of the [[Executive Yuan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tpg.gov.tw/|title=Taiwan Provincial Government Official Website|accessdate=17 July 2018}}</ref> However, the position of the Chairman of the Provincial Government is retained to comply with [[Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China|the Constitution]].\n\n== Historical government buildings ==\nHistorically, before all its functionalities were handed to the [[Executive Yuan]] in July 2018. the provincial government was located in [[Taipei]] from 1947 to 1956, and in [[Zhongxing New Village]] from 1957 to July 2018.\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Order\n|width=400|'''First'''||width=400|'''Second'''\n|-\n!Location\n|Ch'\u00eang-chung, [[Taipei]] City<br><small>(now [[Zhongzheng District|Zhongzheng]], [[Taipei]])</small>\n|[[Zhongxing New Village]],<br>[[Nantou City]], [[Nantou County]]\n|-\n!Date in use\n|May 1947 to 1956||1957 to July 2018\n|-\n!Photo\n|[[File:Executive Yuan 20050703.jpg|300px]]||[[File:Taiwan the Province Government Building.JPG|300px]]\n|-\n!Notes\n|Currently the [[Executive Yuan]] building\n|Currently the Office of the Zhongxing New Village Revitalization Project, [[National Development Council (Taiwan)|National Development Council]]\n|}\n\n== Governor of Taiwan ==\n===Official titles of the governor===\n{|class=wikitable\n!rowspan=2|Year!!colspan=3|Full title!!rowspan=2|Literally!!rowspan=2 width=500|Notes\n|-\n![[Chinese character|Chinese]]!![[Taiwanese Mandarin|Mandarin]]<br>([[Pinyin]])!![[Taiwanese Hokkien|Hokkien]]<br>([[Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b]])\n|-\n|1945\u20131947||{{lang|zh-Hant|\u81fa\u7063\u7701<br>\u884c\u653f\u9577\u5b98}}||T\u00e1iw\u0101nsh\u011bng<br>X\u00edngzh\u00e8ng<br>Zh\u01cenggu\u0101n||T\u00e2i-o\u00e2n-s\u00e9ng<br>H\u00eang-ch\u00e8ng<br>Ti\u00f3ng-Kua\u207f\n|Chief Executive of<br>Taiwan Province||The position of Chief Executive was temporarily part of the [[Executive Yuan]], the position was legalized in ''Taiwan Provincial Administrative Executive Office Organizational Outline'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u81fa\u7063\u7701\u884c\u653f\u9577\u5b98\u516c\u7f72\u7d44\u7e54\u689d\u4f8b}} ''T\u00e1iw\u0101n-sh\u011bng x\u00edngzh\u00e8ng zh\u01cenggu\u0101n g\u014dngsh\u01d4 z\u01d4zh\u012b ti\u00e1ol\u00ec'') of September 20, 1945.\n|-\n|1947\u20131994||{{lang|zh-Hant|\u81fa\u7063\u7701\u653f\u5e9c<br>\u4e3b\u5e2d}}||T\u00e1iw\u0101nsh\u011bng<br>Zh\u00e8ngf\u01d4 Zh\u01d4x\u00ed||T\u00e2i-o\u00e2n-s\u00e9ng<br>Ch\u00e8ng-h\u00fa Ch\u00fa-se\u030dk\n|Chairman of Taiwan<br>Provincial Government||After the [[February 28 Incident]], the Administrative Executive Office was reformed to a provincial government.

{"title_page": "Sesklo and Dimini fortifications", "text_new": "[[File:Greece (ancient) Thessaly.svg|thumb|Thessaly region in modern Greece]]\n[[Sesklo]] and [[Dimini]] are two of the main sites of the [[Neolithic Greece|Greek Neolithic Period]], ca. 6000-3000 BCE. They are located only a few miles apart in the [[Thessaly]] region of Greece and were excavated between 1899 and 1906 by [[Christos Tsountas]].<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> Both settlements included a large central [[megaron]] building surrounded by smaller buildings and houses, as well as enclosing walls. The purpose of these walls has long been debated, with Tsountas initially claiming that they had defensive military purposes. However, over time more and more archaeologists have concluded that they instead functioned as retaining walls, to mark habitation spaces, as animal enclosures, or were used for ritual purposes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Warfare in Neolithic Europe|last=Heath|first=Julian|publisher=Pen & Sword Books Ltd|year=2017|isbn=978 1 47387 985 0|location=South Yorkshire, UK|pages=1\u201310}}</ref> Regardless of their intended purpose, the fortifications reinforced the distinction between the inner settlement and outside world.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Demoule|first=Jean-Paul|last2=Perl\u00e8s|first2=Catherine|date=1993|title=The Greek Neolithic: A New Review|jstor=25800637|journal=Journal of World Prehistory|volume=7|issue=4|pages=355\u2013416|doi=10.1007/bf00997801}}</ref>\n\n== Site locations ==\n\n=== Sesklo ===\n[[File:Sesklo DSC 2020a.jpg|thumb|Remaining foundations at Sesklo]]\nThe [[Sesklo]] ({{lang-el|\u03a3\u03ad\u03c3\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf}}) settlement consists of three main phases. In general, there were close houses centered around a larger megaron with a paved courtyard.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Sesklo&object=site|title=Sesklo (Site)|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2017-10-23}}</ref> The early settlement had an unusually thick wall on the east side, but the middle to late settlements are of greater interest when considering Neolithic fortifications. Sesklo's stone walls enclosed parts of the acropolis and were approximately one meter in width. There is a possibility that they were capped with structures to create a taller barrier, but this is uncertain.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Dimini ===\nThe [[Dimini]] (\u0394\u03b9\u03bc\u03ae\u03bd\u03b9) settlement was approximately {{convert|5000|m2|sqft}} and included a megaron in an oval courtyard with smaller buildings and houses outside of the fortifications. This site flourished during the late Neolithic period and used many of the same construction methods employed earlier at Sesklo, including stone walls. The Dimini fortifications were composed of 6 or 7 concentric circle walls that were 2\u20133 meters tall and as close as 1 meter apart.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Dimini&object=Site|title=Dimini (Site)|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2017-10-23}}</ref> They were also likely made taller with mud brick or wooden [[palisade]]s.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Defensive fortifications ==\n\n===  Protection ===\n[[File:Spondylidae - Spondylus gaederopus.JPG|thumb|Valuable oyster shell used by the Dimini settlement]]\nBuilding a wall alone has been said to be a statement about the capabilities and level of preparedness of the settlement to defend itself at the very least. The decision to build them also expresses a lack of trust that Sesklo and Dimini may have had in each other or in other Neolithic sites. These settlements felt some need to consolidate and protect themselves, indicating at least some apprehension.<ref name=\":1\" /> Further, Dimini was largely in control of production and exchange of an exotic and valuable type of [[Spondylus gaederopus|oyster shell]], which was used in creating personal ornaments like rings, beads, and buttons. It was generally limited to the few elites and functioned as an expression of status. Fortifications would have protected this valuable asset.<ref name=\":0\" /> Various types of weapons have been found at Sesklo, including stone projectile points, clay and stone sling bullets, axes, and knives. If these weapons were used in a warfare context, fortified sites would have provided necessary defense and protection. Note, however, that many of these weapons could have had alternative purposes, including hunting.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Construction ===\n[[File:L\u00f6wentor Mykene.jpg|thumb|The [[Lion Gate]] at [[Mycenae]], which serves a similar function as the baffle gates at Sesklo and Dimini.]]\nOther Neolithic sites in Europe built structures using the same construction methods where a military function has been argued for very convincingly, including [[Makry Gialos|Makriyalos]] in Pieria, Strofilas on [[Andros]] Island, and in northeast Bulgaria. It is unlikely that Sesklo and Dimini would have used the same mechanisms for entirely different purposes.<ref name=\":1\" /> Large empty areas of land act as buffer zone to separate settlements at war and expose invaders as they cross them to approach an opposing settlement, giving defenders the opportunity to prepare. The presence of such no man's lands in Thessaly indicates that there may have been conflict and a need for defensive fortifications.<ref name=\":1\" /> The walls at both settlements included baffle gates, a classic characteristic of other fortified sites during this time period in Greece. This feature forces invaders to expose their flanks by requiring them to turn left, exposing their unshielded right side. Sesklo had one such gate on the western side, which was not protected by the steep ravine located on the eastern side of the settlement. Dimini had 4 or 5 of these gates, as well as other narrow openings into living and working areas, which are easy to defend, would slow down and confuse invaders, and give inhabitants multiple exits.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Runnels|first=Curtis N.|last2=Payne|first2=Claire|last3=Rifkind|first3=Noam V.|last4=White|first4=Chantel|last5=Wolff|first5=Nicholas P.|last6=LeBlanc|first6=Steven A.|date=2009|title=Warfare in Neolithic Thessaly: A Case Study|jstor=25622691|journal=Hesperia: The Journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens|volume=78|issue=2|pages=165\u2013194|doi=10.2972/hesp.78.2.165}}</ref>\n\n=== Destruction ===\nThe remains at Sesklo indicate extensive burning and destruction, serving as significant evidence for conflict. There is information to suggest that Dimini may be to blame for the destruction at Sesklo.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, it is also important to note that the burning could have been due to other causes, including the use of flammable building materials.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Alternative functions ==\nUpon further investigation, many archaeologists have determined there are many other likely uses for the walls found at Sesklo and Dimini.

They are located only a few miles apart in the [[Thessaly]] region of Greece and were excavated between 1899 and 1906 by [[Christos Tsountas]].<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> Both settlements included a large central [[megaron]] building surrounded by smaller buildings and houses, as well as enclosing walls. The purpose of these walls has long been debated, with Tsountas initially claiming that they had defensive military purposes. However, over time more and more archaeologists have concluded that they instead functioned as retaining walls, to mark habitation spaces, as animal enclosures, or were used for ritual purposes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Warfare in Neolithic Europe|last=Heath|first=Julian|publisher=Pen & Sword Books Ltd|year=2017|isbn=978 1 47387 985 0|location=South Yorkshire, UK|pages=1\u201310}}</ref> Regardless of their intended purpose, the fortifications reinforced the distinction between the inner settlement and outside world.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Demoule|first=Jean-Paul|last2=Perl\u00e8s|first2=Catherine|date=1993|title=The Greek Neolithic: A New Review|jstor=25800637|journal=Journal of World Prehistory|volume=7|issue=4|pages=355\u2013416|doi=10.1007/bf00997801}}</ref>\n\n== Site locations ==\n\n=== Sesklo ===\n[[File:Sesklo DSC 2020a.jpg|thumb|Remaining foundations at Sesklo]]\nThe [[Sesklo]] ({{lang-el|\u03a3\u03ad\u03c3\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf}}) settlement consists of three main phases. In general, there were close houses centered around a larger megaron with a paved courtyard.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Sesklo&object=site|title=Sesklo (Site)|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2017-10-23}}</ref> The early settlement had an unusually thick wall on the east side, but the middle to late settlements are of greater interest when considering Neolithic fortifications. Sesklo\u2019s stone walls enclosed parts of the acropolis and were approximately one meter in width. There is a possibility that they were capped with structures to create a taller barrier, but this is uncertain.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Dimini ===\nThe [[Dimini]] (\u0394\u03b9\u03bc\u03ae\u03bd\u03b9) settlement was approximately {{convert|5000|m2|sqft}} and included a megaron in an oval courtyard with smaller buildings and houses outside of the fortifications. This site flourished during the late Neolithic period and used many of the same construction methods employed earlier at Sesklo, including stone walls. The Dimini fortifications were composed of 6 or 7 concentric circle walls that were 2\u20133 meters tall and as close as 1 meter apart.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Dimini&object=Site|title=Dimini (Site)|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2017-10-23}}</ref> They were also likely made taller with mud brick or wooden [[palisade]]s.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Defensive fortifications ==\n\n===  Protection ===\n[[File:Spondylidae - Spondylus gaederopus.JPG|thumb|Valuable oyster shell used by the Dimini settlement]]\nBuilding a wall alone has been said to be a statement about the capabilities and level of preparedness of the settlement to defend itself at the very least. The decision to build them also expresses a lack of trust that Sesklo and Dimini may have had in each other or in other Neolithic sites. These settlements felt some need to consolidate and protect themselves, indicating at least some apprehension.<ref name=\":1\" /> Further, Dimini was largely in control of production and exchange of an exotic and valuable type of [[Spondylus gaederopus|oyster shell]], which was used in creating personal ornaments like rings, beads, and buttons. It was generally limited to the few elites and functioned as an expression of status. Fortifications would have protected this valuable asset.<ref name=\":0\" /> Various types of weapons have been found at Sesklo, including stone projectile points, clay and stone sling bullets, axes, and knives. If these weapons were used in a warfare context, fortified sites would have provided necessary defense and protection. Note, however, that many of these weapons could have had alternative purposes, including hunting.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Construction ===\n[[File:L\u00f6wentor Mykene.jpg|thumb|The [[Lion Gate]] at [[Mycenae]], which serves a similar function as the baffle gates at Sesklo and Dimini.]]\nOther Neolithic sites in Europe built structures using the same construction methods where a military function has been argued for very convincingly, including [[Makry Gialos|Makriyalos]] in Pieria, Strofilas on [[Andros]] Island, and in northeast Bulgaria. It is unlikely that Sesklo and Dimini would have used the same mechanisms for entirely different purposes.<ref name=\":1\" /> Large empty areas of land act as buffer zone to separate settlements at war and expose invaders as they cross them to approach an opposing settlement, giving defenders the opportunity to prepare. The presence of such no man\u2019s lands in Thessaly indicates that there may have been conflict and a need for defensive fortifications.<ref name=\":1\" /> The walls at both settlements included baffle gates, a classic characteristic of other fortified sites during this time period in Greece. This feature forces invaders to expose their flanks by requiring them to turn left, exposing their unshielded right side. Sesklo had one such gate on the western side, which was not protected by the steep ravine located on the eastern side of the settlement. Dimini had 4 or 5 of these gates, as well as other narrow openings into living and working areas, which are easy to defend, would slow down and confuse invaders, and give inhabitants multiple exits.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Runnels|first=Curtis N.|last2=Payne|first2=Claire|last3=Rifkind|first3=Noam V.|last4=White|first4=Chantel|last5=Wolff|first5=Nicholas P.|last6=LeBlanc|first6=Steven A.|date=2009|title=Warfare in Neolithic Thessaly: A Case Study|jstor=25622691|journal=Hesperia: The Journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens|volume=78|issue=2|pages=165\u2013194|doi=10.2972/hesp.78.2.165}}</ref>\n\n=== Destruction ===\nThe remains at Sesklo indicate extensive burning and destruction, serving as significant evidence for conflict.
