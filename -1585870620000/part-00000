However the latter belief is questionable.\n\n== Titles used by Tuluva Vellalas==\nMudaliar, Pillai, Odeyar are the most common titles used.

Danishefsky]].<ref name=Danishefsky /><ref name=Kurti/> Because the diene is very electron-rich it is a very reactive [[reagent]] in [[Diels-Alder reaction]]s. This diene reacts rapidly with electrophilic alkenes, such as [[maleic anhydride]]. The [[methoxy]] group promotes highly [[regioselective addition]]s. The diene is known to react with [[amine]]s,<ref name=Yuan2004 /> [[aldehydes]], [[alkenes]] and [[alkynes]].<ref name=Kurti/> Reactions with imines <ref name=Loncaric /> and nitro-olefins <ref name=lode/> have been reported.\n\nIt was first synthesized by the reaction of [[trimethylsilyl chloride]] with ''4-methoxy-3-buten-2-one'' and [[zinc chloride]]:<ref name=orgsynth />\n\n[[File:Danishefskys diene application2.png|center|400px|Danishefsky\u2019s diene]]\n\nThe diene has two features of interest: the substituents promote regiospecific addition to unsymmetrical dienophiles and the resulting adduct is amenable to further functional group manipulations after the addition reaction. High [[regioselectivity]] is obtained with unsymmetrical alkenes with a preference for a 1,2-relation of the ether group with the electron-deficient alkene-carbon. All this is exemplified in this [[aza Diels-Alder reaction]]:<ref name=pegot /><ref name=comment />\n\n[[File:AzaDA DanishefskyDiene.png|center|400px|Danishefsky\u2019s diene in Aza-Diels_Alder]]\nIn the cycloaddition product, the [[silyl ether]] is a [[synthon]] for a [[carbonyl]] group through the [[enol]]. The [[methoxy]] group is susceptible to an [[elimination reaction]] enabling the formation of a new [[alkene]] group.\n\nApplications in [[asymmetric synthesis]] have been reported.<ref name=simonsen/><ref name=yao2000 /><ref name=han2000 /><ref name=iwama2000/><ref name=Bernardelli/><ref name=wang2001/><ref name=Yamashita/><ref name=du /><ref name=Ghosh/><ref name=Zhao2013/><ref name=wang2002/><ref name=zheng2014/> Derivatives have been reported.<ref name=amii />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|4|refs=\n<ref name=Danishefsky>[[Samuel J.

Danishefsky]].<ref name=Danishefsky /><ref name=Kurti/> Because the diene is very electron-rich it is a very reactive [[reagent]] in [[Diels-Alder reaction]]s. This diene reacts rapidly with electrophilic alkenes, such as [[maleic anhydride]]. The [[methoxy]] group promotes highly [[regioselective addition]]s. The diene is known to react with [[amine]]s,<ref name=Yuan2004 /> [[aldehydes]], [[alkenes]] and [[alkynes]].<ref name=Kurti/> Reactions with imines <ref name=Loncaric /> and nitro-olefins <ref name=lode/> have been reported.\n\nIt was first synthesized by the reaction of [[trimethylsilyl chloride]] with ''4-methoxy-3-buten-2-one'' and [[zinc chloride]]:<ref name=orgsynth />\n\n[[File:Danishefskys diene application2.png|center|400px|Danishefsky\u2019s diene]]\n\nThe diene has two features of interest: the substituents promote regiospecific addition to unsymmetrical dienophiles and the resulting adduct is amenable to further functional group manipulations after the addition reaction. High [[regioselectivity]] is obtained with unsymmetrical alkenes with a preference for a 1,2-relation of the ether group with the electron-deficient alkene-carbon. All this is exemplified in this [[aza Diels-Alder reaction]]:<ref name=pegot /><ref name=comment />\n\n[[File:AzaDA DanishefskyDiene.png|center|400px|Danishefsky\u2019s diene in Aza-Diels_Alder]]\nIn the cycloaddition product, the [[silyl ether]] is a [[synthon]] for a [[carbonyl]] group through the [[enol]]. The [[methoxy]] group is susceptible to an [[elimination reaction]] enabling the formation of a new [[alkene]] group.\n\nApplications in [[asymmetric synthesis]] have been reported.<ref name=simonsen/><ref name=yao2000 /><ref name=han2000 /><ref name=iwama2000/><ref name=Bernardelli/><ref name=wang2001/><ref name=Yamashita/><ref name=du /><ref name=Ghosh/><ref name=Zhao2013/><ref name=wang2002/><ref name=zheng2014/> Derivatives have been reported.<ref name=amii />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|4|refs=\n<ref name=Danishefsky>[[Samuel J.

The number 666 was also mentioned in various newspapers.

However, these numbers appear to also include the panes in the three smaller pyramids on the north, east, and south sides of the main pyramid.</ref>\n\nThe myth resurfaced in 2003, when [[Dan Brown]] incorporated it in his best-selling novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', in which the protagonist reflects that \"this pyramid, at President Mitterrand's explicit demand, had been constructed of exactly 666 panes of glass&nbsp;\u2014 a bizarre request that had always been a hot topic among conspiracy buffs who claimed 666 was the number of [[Satan]].\"<ref>Dan Brown.
