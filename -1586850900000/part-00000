When Johann Wilhelm, the last duke of Berg-Mark, died in 1609, the [[Treaty of Xanten]] attributed the Berg County (including Waldbr\u00f6l) to the duchy of Pfalz-Neuburg of the Wittelsbach family.\n\nBetween 1816 and 1932, the town of Waldbr\u00f6l was the residence of the head of the district authority and seat of the Prussian Administrative District of Waldbr\u00f6l existing at that time.\n\nOn December 15, 1906, the extension of the Wiehl Valley railroad<ref name=Wiehltalbahn /> was brought on steam from Wiehl to Waldbr\u00f6l, linking Waldbr\u00f6l to the German railway network.\n\n===Nazi period===\nHailing from Niederbreidenbach near N\u00fcmbrecht, Dr. [[Robert Ley]], one of the leading representatives of National Socialism, intended to make Waldbr\u00f6l the \"largest town between [[Cologne]] and [[Kassel]]\". Amongst other things, the so-called ''Volkstraktorenwerke'' (National Tractor Plants), an Adolf Hitler School, and a [[Strength Through Joy]] (KdF) hotel were projected.

Among others, this process was fostered by the fact that Waldbr\u00f6l resident Horst Waffenschmidt was Commissioner for Ethnic German Immigrants (Aussiedlerbeauftragter) of the Federal Government.\n\n==Town coat of arms==\nSince 1952 Waldbr\u00f6l has been entitled to bear the town coat of arms as described in \u00a72, section 2, of the main statute of the town: \n\"On a green ground a black oak tree, bearing leaves and acorns, between two small silver shields. At the base of the tree a silver brook flows. The left-hand shield bears an inverted blue ploughshare; the right-hand shield bears a red lion rampant, with blue teeth and claws and a forked tail.\"\n\n==Facilities==\n* District Hospital\n* District court\n* Centre for a Buddhist religious community, in the former armed forces academy is the European Institute of Applied Buddhism, The EIAB.<ref>http://www.eiab.eu</ref> 20 monks and 30 nuns live there as apprentices of the Zen master [[Thich Nhat Hanh]].

Recently the wall got a complete overhaul and the slogan was re-painted. The wall is now officially approved as a \"Monument To Peace\".\n* In 1863, a monument was erected in the vicinity of the Protestant church in honour of Prussian King Frederick William III: a donation from the Waldbr\u00f6l district on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the struggle for independence of the Prussian state.

Since the early 1950s it has served as the country hostel of the Humboldt Grammar School in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n===After WW II===\nIn 1957, Waldbr\u00f6l was the third municipality in upper Berg county to be awarded the status of \"town\".\n\nBetween 1990 and 2006, Waldbr\u00f6l was the location of the German Armed Forces Academy for Information and Communication (''Akademie der Bundeswehr f\u00fcr Information und Kommunikation''), which was founded here and like its predecessors the Transformation Centre (), the Psychological Defense School (''Schule f\u00fcr psychologische Verteidigung''), the Communication Academy (''Akademie f\u00fcr Kommunikation''), the Department for Studies and Exercises (''Amt f\u00fcr Studien und \u00dcbungen''), and the Centre For Analyses And Studies (''Zentrum f\u00fcr Analysen und Studien''), was accommodated in the hotel building.\n\nFrom 1990 onwards, Waldbr\u00f6l was the destination of intense immigration of ethnic German immigrants from the Soviet Union/CIS countries; at least 3,000 of them became inhabitants of Waldbr\u00f6l. Among others, this process was fostered by the fact that Waldbr\u00f6l resident Horst Waffenschmidt was Commissioner for Ethnic German Immigrants (Aussiedlerbeauftragter) of the Federal Government.\n\n==Town coat of arms==\nSince 1952 Waldbr\u00f6l has been entitled to bear the town coat of arms as described in \u00a72, section 2, of the main statute of the town: \n\"On a green ground a black oak tree, bearing leaves and acorns, between two small silver shields. At the base of the tree a silver brook flows. The left-hand shield bears an inverted blue ploughshare; the right-hand shield bears a red lion rampant, with blue teeth and claws and a forked tail.\"\n\n==Facilities==\n* District Hospital\n* District court\n* Centre for a Buddhist religious community, in the former armed forces academy is the European Institute of Applied Buddhism, The EIAB.<ref>http://www.eiab.eu</ref> 20 monks and 30 nuns live there as apprentices of the Zen master [[Thich Nhat Hanh]].

It was a part of the projected Adolf Hitler School. In the early 1980s, unknowns painted the slogan \"No more war!\" in huge letters upon the wall. Recently the wall got a complete overhaul and the slogan was re-painted. The wall is now officially approved as a \"Monument To Peace\".\n* In 1863, a monument was erected in the vicinity of the Protestant church in honour of Prussian King Frederick William III: a donation from the Waldbr\u00f6l district on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the struggle for independence of the Prussian state.

In March 1539, negotiations for Anne's marriage to Henry began, as Henry believed that he needed to form a political alliance with her brother, [[Wilhelm, Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|William]], who was a leader of the Protestants of western Germany, to strengthen his position against potential attacks from Catholic France and the [[Holy Roman Empire]].<ref>http://blog.english-heritage.org.uk/henry-viii-and-anne-of-cleves/</ref>\n\nAnne arrived in England on 27 December 1539 and married Henry on 6 January 1540. However, after six months, the marriage was declared [[unconsummated]] and, as a result, she was not crowned [[queen consort]]. Following the [[annulment]], she was given a generous settlement by the King, and thereafter referred to as ''the King's Beloved Sister''.{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=108}}{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&pg=PA252#v=onepage&q&f=false 252]}} She lived to see the coronation of [[Queen Mary I]], outliving the rest of Henry's wives.{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=165}}\n\n==Early life==\nAnne was born in 1515, on either 22 September,{{sfn|Weir|2009|p=155}}{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=7}} or more probably 28 June.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Darsie |first1=Heather |title=Anna, Duchess of Cleves: The King's Beloved Sister |date=15 April 2019 |publisher=Amberley Publishing |isbn=9781445677101 |pages=17\u201320}}</ref> She was born in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]],<ref>At the time, the area was in the Duchy of Berg.</ref> the second daughter of [[John III, Duke of Cleves|John III]] of the [[House of La Marck]], Duke of [[Duchy of J\u00fclich|J\u00fclich]] ''[[jure uxoris]]'', [[Duchy of Cleves|Cleves]], [[Berg (state)|Berg]] ''jure uxoris'', Count of [[County of Mark|Mark]], also known as [[de la Marck]] and [[County of Ravensberg|Ravensberg]] ''jure uxoris'' (often referred to as Duke of Cleves) who died in 1538, and his wife [[Maria of J\u00fclich-Berg|Maria, Duchess of Julich-Berg]] (1491\u20131543). She grew up in [[Schloss Burg (Solingen)|Schloss Burg]] on the edge of [[Solingen]].\n\nAnne's father was influenced by [[Erasmus]] and followed a moderate path within the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].  He sided with the [[Schmalkaldic League]] and opposed [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]]. After John's death, Anne's brother [[Wilhelm, Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|William]] became [[United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg]], bearing the promising epithet \"The Rich\". In 1526, her elder sister [[Sibylle of Cleves|Sibylle]] was married to [[John Frederick, Elector of Saxony]], head of the [[Schmalkaldic League|Protestant Confederation of Germany]] and considered the \"Champion of the Reformation\".\n\nAt the age of 11 (1527), Anne was betrothed to [[Francis I, Duke of Lorraine|Francis]], son and heir of [[Antoine, Duke of Lorraine]] while he was only 10.{{sfn|Norton|2010|pp=12\u201313}} Thus the betrothal was considered unofficial and was cancelled in 1535. Her brother William was a [[Lutheran]] but the family was unaligned religiously, with her mother, the Duchess Maria, described as a \"strict Catholic\".{{sfn|Fraser|1992|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=HKynDn8DnhEC&pg=PT369&lpg=PT369#v=onepage&q&f=false 364]}} The Duke's ongoing dispute over [[Guelders|Gelderland]] with Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] made them suitable allies for England's King Henry VIII in the wake of the [[Truce of Nice]]. The match with Anne was urged on the King by his chief minister, [[Thomas Cromwell]].\n\n===Wedding preparations===\nThe artist [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] was dispatched to [[D\u00fcren]] to paint portraits of Anne and her younger sister, [[Amalia of Cleves|Amalia]], each of whom Henry was considering as his fourth wife. Henry required the artist to be as accurate as possible, not to flatter the sisters. The two versions of Holbein's portrait are in the [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]] in Paris and the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London.

Cromwell oversaw the talks and a marriage treaty was signed on 4 October of that year.\n\nHenry valued education and cultural sophistication in women, but Anne lacked these.  She had received no formal education but was skilled in needlework and liked playing card games. She could read and write, but only in German.{{sfn|Norton|2010|pp=10\u201311}} Nevertheless, Anne was considered gentle, virtuous and docile, which is why she was recommended as a suitable candidate for Henry.\n\nAnne was described by the French ambassador, [[Charles de Marillac]], as tall and slim, \"of middling beauty and of very assured and resolute countenance\".{{sfn|Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII 15: 1540 no. 22}} She was fair haired and was said to have had a lovely face. In the words of the chronicler [[Edward Hall]], \"Her hair hanging down, which was fair, yellow and long ... she was apparelled after the English fashion, with a French hood, which so set forth her beauty and good visage, that every creature rejoiced to behold her\".{{sfn|Hall|1809|pp=836\u2013837}} She appeared rather solemn by English standards, and looked old for her age. Holbein painted her with high forehead, heavy-lidded eyes and a pointed chin.\n\nHenry met her privately on New Year's Day 1540 at Rochester Abbey in [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] on her journey from [[Dover]].{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&pg=PA138#v=onepage&q&f=false 138]}} Henry and some of his courtiers, following a courtly-love tradition, went disguised into the room where Anne was staying.{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&pg=PA138#v=onepage&q&f=false 138]}} [[Eustace Chapuys]] reported:\n{{Wives of Henry VIII}}\n\n<blockquote>[The King] so went up into the chamber where the said Lady Anne was looking out of a window to see the bull-baiting which was going on in the courtyard, and suddenly he embraced and kissed her, and showed her a token which the king had sent her for New Year\u2019s gift, and she being abashed and not knowing who it was thanked him, and so he spoke with her. But she regarded him little, but always looked out the window\u2026. and when the king saw that she took so little notice of his coming he went into another chamber and took off his cloak and came in again in a coat of purple velvet. And when the lords and knights saw his grace they did him reverence.<ref>[https://thehistoryjar.com/2017/01/06/anne-of-cleves-not-love-at-first-sight/ \"Anne of Cleves \u2013 Not Love at First Sight\" ''The History Jar''] retrieved February 6, 2017</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to the testimony of his companions, he was disappointed with Anne, feeling she was not as described. According to the chronicler [[Charles Wriothesley]], Anne \"regarded him little\",{{sfn|Wriothesley|1875|pp=109\u2013110}} though it is unknown whether she knew this was the king.{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&pg=PA132#v=onepage&q&f=false 132]}} Henry did then reveal his true identity to Anne, although he is said to have been put off the marriage from then on. Henry and Anne then met officially on 3 January on Blackheath outside the gates of Greenwich Park, where a grand reception was laid out.{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&pg=PA146#v=onepage&q&f=false 146]}}\n\nMost historians believe that he later used as excuses Anne's alleged unsatisfactory appearance and failure to inspire him to consummate the marriage, saying he felt he had been misled, for everyone had praised Anne's attractions: \"She is nothing so fair as she hath been reported\", he complained.{{sfn|Schofield|2011|p=361}} Cromwell received some of the blame for the portrait by Holbein which Henry believed had not been an accurate representation of Anne and for some of the exaggerated reports of her beauty. When the king finally met Anne, he was reportedly shocked by her plain appearance, and the marriage was never consummated.{{sfn|Elton|1991|p=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=Z15sBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA157&dq=cromwell+anne+of+cleves+downfall&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiIktfDyZ3VAhXG7IMKHb-cCXM4ChDoAQgtMAE#v=onepage&q=cromwell%20anne%20of%20cleves%20downfall&f=false 157]}}{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&pg=PA77&dq=cromwell+anne+of+cleves+Duchess+of+Milan+%22as+the+golden+sun+did+the+silver&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjz1ZC0z53VAhUN0IMKHWSfAnkQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&q=cromwell%20anne%20of%20cleves%20Duchess%20of%20Milan%20%22as%20the%20golden%20sun%20did%20the%20silver&f=false 77]}}\n\nHenry urged Cromwell to find a legal way to avoid the marriage but, by this point, doing so was impossible without endangering the vital alliance with the Germans. In his anger and frustration the King finally turned on Cromwell, to his subsequent regret.{{sfn|Lehmberg|1977|p=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=MhY9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA127&dq=Henry+VIII+execution+of+cromwell+later+regretted&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiH8P_L0Z3VAhVJ44MKHdxECwQQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Henry%20VIII%20execution%20of%20cromwell%20later%20regretted&f=false 127]}}\n\n=== Marriage ===\n[[File:Bruyn Anne of Cleves.jpg|right|thumb|A portrait of Anne in the 1540s by [[Barthel Bruyn the Elder|Bartholom\u00e4us Bruyn the elder]].]]\n\nDespite Henry's very vocal misgivings, the two were married on 6 January 1540 at the royal [[Palace of Placentia]] in [[Greenwich]], London, by [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Archbishop]] [[Thomas Cranmer]]. The phrase \"God send me well to keep\" was engraved around Anne's wedding ring. Immediately after arriving in England, Anne conformed to the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] form of worship, which Henry expected.{{sfn|Weir|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=M1yHXitDdyQC&pg=PA412&lpg=PA412 412]}} The couple's first night as husband and wife was not a successful one.

Witness statements were taken from a number of courtiers and two physicians which register the king's disappointment at her appearance. Henry had also commented to [[Groom of the Stool#Grooms of the Stool under Henry VIII|Thomas Heneage and Anthony Denny]] that he could not believe she was a virgin.{{sfn|Strype I(II)|1822|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/ecclesiasticalme0102stry#page/450/mode/2up 450\u2013463]}}\n\nShortly afterwards, Anne was asked for her consent to an annulment, to which she agreed.  Cromwell, the moving force behind the marriage, was [[attainder|attainted]] for [[treason]]. The marriage was annulled on 9 July 1540, on the grounds of non-consummation and her pre-contract to Francis of Lorraine. Henry VIII's physician stated that after the wedding night, Henry said he was not impotent because he experienced \"''{{lang|la|duas pollutiones nocturnas in somno}}''\" (two [[nocturnal emission|nocturnal pollutions]] while in sleep; i.e., two [[wet dream]]s).{{sfn|Strype I(II)|1822|p=[https://archive.org/stream/ecclesiasticalme0102stry#page/460/mode/2up 461]}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Holbein en Angleterre |work=Amateur d'Art, par Lunettes Rouge |date=29 November 2006 |publisher=[[Le Monde|La Vie\u2013Le Monde Group]] |url=http://lunettesrouges.blog.lemonde.fr/2006/11/29/holbein-en-angleterre/ |accessdate=4 January 2014 |language=fr }}.</ref>\n\n==After the annulment==\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Anne of Cleves.svg|thumb|250px|Anne of Cleves' arms as queen consort.{{sfn|Boutell|1863|p=243}}]]\n\nThe former queen received a generous [[legal settlement|settlement]], including [[Richmond Palace]], and [[Hever Castle]], home of Henry's former in-laws, the Boleyns. [[Anne of Cleves House]], in [[Lewes]], [[East Sussex]], is just one of many properties she owned; she never lived there. Henry and Anne became good friends\u2014she was an honorary member of the King's family and was referred to as \"the King's Beloved Sister\". She was invited to court often and, out of gratitude for her not contesting the annulment, Henry decreed that she would be given precedence over all women in England save his own wife and daughters.{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=108}}\n\nAfter [[Catherine Howard]] was beheaded, Anne and her brother, [[William, Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg]], pressed the king to remarry Anne.  Henry quickly refused to do so.{{sfn|Farquhar|2001|p=77}} She seems to have disliked [[Catherine Parr]], and reportedly reacted to the news of Henry's sixth marriage with the remark \"Madam Parr is taking a great burden on herself.\"{{sfn|Weir|2007|p=498}}\n\nIn March 1547, [[Edward VI]]'s [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] asked her to move out of [[Bletchingley]] Palace, her usual residence, to [[Penshurst Place]] to make way for [[Thomas Cawarden]], [[Master of Revels]].

According to [[Simon Renard]], the imperial ambassador, Anne's close association with Elizabeth had convinced the Queen that \"the Lady [Anne] of Cleves was of the plot and intrigued with the Duke of Cleves to obtain help for Elizabeth: matters in which the king of France was the prime mover\".{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=151}} There is no evidence that Anne was invited back to court after 1554.{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=154}} She was compelled to live a quiet and obscure life on her estates.{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=154}} After her arrival as the King's bride, Anne never left England. Despite occasional feelings of homesickness, Anne was generally content in England and was described by [[Raphael Holinshed|Holinshed]] as \"a ladie of right commendable regards, courteous, gentle, a good housekeeper and verie bountifull to her servants.\"{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=165}}\n\n==Death==\nWhen Anne's health began to fail, Mary allowed her to live at [[Chelsea Manor|Chelsea Old Manor]], where Henry's last wife, [[Catherine Parr]], had lived after her remarriage.{{sfn|Fraser|1992|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=HKynDn8DnhEC&pg=PT507#v=onepage&q&f=false 504]}} Here, in the middle of July 1557, Anne dictated her last will. In it, she mentions her brother, sister, and sister-in-law, as well as the future Queen Elizabeth, the Duchess of Suffolk, and the Countess of Arundel.{{sfn|Norton|2010|pp=158\u2013161}} She left some money to her servants and asked Mary and Elizabeth to employ them in their households.{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=161}} She was remembered by everyone who served her as a particularly generous and easy-going mistress.{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=165}}\n\nAnne died at Chelsea Old Manor on 16 July 1557, eight weeks before her forty-second birthday.

She is the only wife of Henry VIII to be buried in the Abbey.\n\nAnne's [[epitaph]] in Westminster Abbey, which is in English, reads simply:<ref>Google Images</ref>\n\n<center>ANNE OF CLEVES</center>\n<center>QUEEN OF ENGLAND</center>\n<center>BORN 1515 * DIED 1557</center>\n\nShe also has the distinction of being the last of Henry VIII's wives to die,{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=165}} as she outlived Henry's last wife, [[Catherine Parr]], by 9 years. She was not the longest-lived, however, since [[Catherine of Aragon]] was 50 at the time of her death.{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=161}}\n\n==Literature==\nAnne is the subject of four biographies: Julia Hamilton's ''Anne of Cleves'' (1972), and Mary Saaler's ''Anne of Cleves: Fourth Wife of Henry VIII'' (1995), [[Elizabeth Norton]]'s ''Anne of Cleves: Henry VIII's Discarded Bride'' (2009), and Heather Darsie's ''Anna, Duchess of Cleves: The King's Beloved Sister'' (2019). Retha Warnicke has written an academic study on Anne's marriage called ''The Marrying of Anne of Cleves. Royal Protocol in Early Modern England'' (2000).\n\nAnne of Cleves appears as a character in many historical novels about Henry's reign. In ''[[The Fifth Queen]]'' (1906) by [[Ford Madox Ford]] she is portrayed as a sensible, practical woman who happily settles for  an annulment in return for  the material benefits it brings. Anne of Cleves is the main character of ''My Lady of Cleves'' (1946) by [[Margaret Campbell Barnes]]. About a third of ''[[The Boleyn Inheritance]]'' (2006) by [[Philippa Gregory]] is recounted from Anne's point of view, covering the period of Henry VIII's marriages to her and to her successor Catherine Howard. The book concludes with Anne living away from court, and avoiding the execution ceremonies of Howard and of [[Jane Boleyn]], sister-in-law to one of Henry's queens and lady-in-waiting to five of the others, including Anne. Gregory includes Anne in a non-fictional review of the period at the end of the book.\n\nAnne and her Holbein portrait in the Louvre are the focus of the novel ''Amenable Women'' (2009) by [[Mavis Cheek]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Annis |title=Amenable Women by Mavis Cheek |work=HistoricalNovels.info |url=http://www.historicalnovels.info/Amenable-Women.html |accessdate=2 April 2012 }}; {{cite web|title=Amenable Women, Mavis Cheek |work=Faber & Faber |url=http://www.faber.co.uk/work/amenable-women/9780571238965/ |accessdate=2 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515022239/http://www.faber.co.uk/work/amenable-women/9780571238965/ |archivedate=15 May 2009 }}</ref> Anne and Catherine Howard are the subject of ''The Queen's Mistake'' by Diane Haeger (2009), while Anne and Jane Seymour are covered in Volume 3 of Dixie Atkins's tetralogy ''A Golden Sorrow'' (2010).

In March 1539, negotiations for Anne's marriage to Henry began, as Henry believed that he needed to form a political alliance with her brother, [[Wilhelm, Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|William]], who was a leader of the Protestants of western Germany, to strengthen his position against potential attacks from Catholic France and the [[Holy Roman Empire]].<ref>http://blog.english-heritage.org.uk/henry-viii-and-anne-of-cleves/</ref>\n\nAnne arrived in England on 27 December 1539 and married Henry on 6 January 1540.

She grew up in [[Schloss Burg (Solingen)|Schloss Burg]] on the edge of [[Solingen]].\n\nAnne's father was influenced by [[Erasmus]] and followed a moderate path within the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].  He sided with the [[Schmalkaldic League]] and opposed [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]]. After John's death, Anne's brother [[Wilhelm, Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|William]] became [[United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg]], bearing the promising epithet \"The Rich\". In 1526, her elder sister [[Sibylle of Cleves|Sibylle]] was married to [[John Frederick, Elector of Saxony]], head of the [[Schmalkaldic League|Protestant Confederation of Germany]] and considered the \"Champion of the Reformation\".\n\nAt the age of 11 (1527), Anne was betrothed to [[Francis I, Duke of Lorraine|Francis]], son and heir of [[Antoine, Duke of Lorraine]] while he was only 10.{{sfn|Norton|2010|pp=12\u201313}} Thus the betrothal was considered unofficial and was cancelled in 1535. Her brother William was a [[Lutheran]] but the family was unaligned religiously, with her mother, the Duchess Maria, described as a \"strict Catholic\".{{sfn|Fraser|1992|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=HKynDn8DnhEC&pg=PT369&lpg=PT369#v=onepage&q&f=false 364]}} The Duke's ongoing dispute over [[Guelders|Gelderland]] with Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] made them suitable allies for England's King Henry VIII in the wake of the [[Truce of Nice]]. The match with Anne was urged on the King by his chief minister, [[Thomas Cromwell]].\n\n===Wedding preparations===\nThe artist [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] was dispatched to [[D\u00fcren]] to paint portraits of Anne and her younger sister, [[Amalia of Cleves|Amalia]], each of whom Henry was considering as his fourth wife. Henry required the artist to be as accurate as possible, not to flatter the sisters. The two versions of Holbein's portrait are in the [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]] in Paris and the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London.

Cromwell oversaw the talks and a marriage treaty was signed on 4 October of that year.\n\nHenry valued education and cultural sophistication in women, but Anne lacked these.  She had received no formal education but was skilled in needlework and liked playing card games. She could read and write, but only in German.{{sfn|Norton|2010|pp=10\u201311}} Nevertheless, Anne was considered gentle, virtuous and docile, which is why she was recommended as a suitable candidate for Henry.\n\nAnne was described by the French ambassador, [[Charles de Marillac]], as tall and slim, \"of middling beauty and of very assured and resolute countenance\".{{sfn|Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII 15: 1540 no. 22}} She was fair haired and was said to have had a lovely face. In the words of the chronicler [[Edward Hall]], \"Her hair hanging down, which was fair, yellow and long ... she was apparelled after the English fashion, with a French hood, which so set forth her beauty and good visage, that every creature rejoiced to behold her\".{{sfn|Hall|1809|pp=836\u2013837}} She appeared rather solemn by English standards, and looked old for her age. Holbein painted her with high forehead, heavy-lidded eyes and a pointed chin.\n\nHenry met her privately on New Year's Day 1540 at Rochester Abbey in [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] on her journey from [[Dover]].{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&pg=PA138#v=onepage&q&f=false 138]}} Henry and some of his courtiers, following a courtly-love tradition, went disguised into the room where Anne was staying.{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&pg=PA138#v=onepage&q&f=false 138]}} [[Eustace Chapuys]] reported:\n{{Wives of Henry VIII}}\n\n<blockquote>[The King] so went up into the chamber where the said Lady Anne was looking out of a window to see the bull-baiting which was going on in the courtyard, and suddenly he embraced and kissed her, and showed her a token which the king had sent her for New Year\u2019s gift, and she being abashed and not knowing who it was thanked him, and so he spoke with her. But she regarded him little, but always looked out the window\u2026. and when the king saw that she took so little notice of his coming he went into another chamber and took off his cloak and came in again in a coat of purple velvet. And when the lords and knights saw his grace they did him reverence.<ref>[https://thehistoryjar.com/2017/01/06/anne-of-cleves-not-love-at-first-sight/ \"Anne of Cleves \u2013 Not Love at First Sight\" ''The History Jar''] retrieved February 6, 2017</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to the testimony of his companions, he was disappointed with Anne, feeling she was not as described. According to the chronicler [[Charles Wriothesley]], Anne \"regarded him little\",{{sfn|Wriothesley|1875|pp=109\u2013110}} though it is unknown whether she knew this was the king.{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&pg=PA132#v=onepage&q&f=false 132]}} Henry did then reveal his true identity to Anne, although he is said to have been put off the marriage from then on. Henry and Anne then met officially on 3 January on Blackheath outside the gates of Greenwich Park, where a grand reception was laid out.{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&pg=PA146#v=onepage&q&f=false 146]}}\n\nMost historians believe that he later used as excuses Anne's alleged unsatisfactory appearance and failure to inspire him to consummate the marriage, saying he felt he had been misled, for everyone had praised Anne's attractions: \"She is nothing so fair as she hath been reported\", he complained.{{sfn|Schofield|2011|p=361}} Cromwell received some of the blame for the portrait by Holbein which Henry believed had not been an accurate representation of Anne and for some of the exaggerated reports of her beauty. When the king finally met Anne, he was reportedly shocked by her plain appearance, and the marriage was never consummated.{{sfn|Elton|1991|p=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=Z15sBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA157&dq=cromwell+anne+of+cleves+downfall&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiIktfDyZ3VAhXG7IMKHb-cCXM4ChDoAQgtMAE#v=onepage&q=cromwell%20anne%20of%20cleves%20downfall&f=false 157]}}{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&pg=PA77&dq=cromwell+anne+of+cleves+Duchess+of+Milan+%22as+the+golden+sun+did+the+silver&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjz1ZC0z53VAhUN0IMKHWSfAnkQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&q=cromwell%20anne%20of%20cleves%20Duchess%20of%20Milan%20%22as%20the%20golden%20sun%20did%20the%20silver&f=false 77]}}\n\nHenry urged Cromwell to find a legal way to avoid the marriage but, by this point, doing so was impossible without endangering the vital alliance with the Germans. In his anger and frustration the King finally turned on Cromwell, to his subsequent regret.{{sfn|Lehmberg|1977|p=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=MhY9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA127&dq=Henry+VIII+execution+of+cromwell+later+regretted&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiH8P_L0Z3VAhVJ44MKHdxECwQQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Henry%20VIII%20execution%20of%20cromwell%20later%20regretted&f=false 127]}}\n\n=== Marriage ===\n[[File:Bruyn Anne of Cleves.jpg|right|thumb|A portrait of Anne in the 1540s by [[Barthel Bruyn the Elder|Bartholom\u00e4us Bruyn the elder]].]]\n\nDespite Henry's very vocal misgivings, the two were married on 6 January 1540 at the royal [[Palace of Placentia]] in [[Greenwich]], London, by [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Archbishop]] [[Thomas Cranmer]]. The phrase \"God send me well to keep\" was engraved around Anne's wedding ring. Immediately after arriving in England, Anne conformed to the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] form of worship, which Henry expected.{{sfn|Weir|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=M1yHXitDdyQC&pg=PA412&lpg=PA412 412]}} The couple's first night as husband and wife was not a successful one.

Witness statements were taken from a number of courtiers and two physicians which register the king's disappointment at her appearance. Henry had also commented to [[Groom of the Stool#Grooms of the Stool under Henry VIII|Thomas Heneage and Anthony Denny]] that he could not believe she was a virgin.{{sfn|Strype I(II)|1822|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/ecclesiasticalme0102stry#page/450/mode/2up 450\u2013463]}}\n\nShortly afterwards, Anne was asked for her consent to an annulment, to which she agreed.  Cromwell, the moving force behind the marriage, was [[attainder|attainted]] for [[treason]]. The marriage was annulled on 9 July 1540, on the grounds of non-consummation and her pre-contract to Francis of Lorraine. Henry VIII's physician stated that after the wedding night, Henry said he was not impotent because he experienced \"''{{lang|la|duas pollutiones nocturnas in somno}}''\" (two [[nocturnal emission|nocturnal pollutions]] while in sleep; i.e., two [[wet dream]]s).{{sfn|Strype I(II)|1822|p=[https://archive.org/stream/ecclesiasticalme0102stry#page/460/mode/2up 461]}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Holbein en Angleterre |work=Amateur d'Art, par Lunettes Rouge |date=29 November 2006 |publisher=[[Le Monde|La Vie\u2013Le Monde Group]] |url=http://lunettesrouges.blog.lemonde.fr/2006/11/29/holbein-en-angleterre/ |accessdate=4 January 2014 |language=fr }}.</ref>\n\n==After the annulment==\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Anne of Cleves.svg|thumb|250px|Anne of Cleves' arms as queen consort.{{sfn|Boutell|1863|p=243}}]]\n\nThe former queen received a generous [[legal settlement|settlement]], including [[Richmond Palace]], and [[Hever Castle]], home of Henry's former in-laws, the Boleyns.

Henry and Anne became good friends\u2014she was an honorary member of the King's family and was referred to as \"the King's Beloved Sister\". She was invited to court often and, out of gratitude for her not contesting the annulment, Henry decreed that she would be given precedence over all women in England save his own wife and daughters.{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=108}}\n\nAfter [[Catherine Howard]] was beheaded, Anne and her brother, [[William, Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg]], pressed the king to remarry Anne.

She is the only wife of Henry VIII to be buried in the Abbey.\n\nAnne's [[epitaph]] in Westminster Abbey, which is in English, reads simply:<ref>Google Images</ref>\n\n<center>ANNE OF CLEVES</center>\n<center>QUEEN OF ENGLAND</center>\n<center>BORN 1515 * DIED 1557</center>\n\nShe also has the distinction of being the last of Henry VIII's wives to die,{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=165}} as she outlived Henry's last wife, [[Catherine Parr]], by 9 years. She was not the longest-lived, however, since [[Catherine of Aragon]] was 50 at the time of her death.{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=161}}\n\n==Literature==\nAnne is the subject of four biographies: Julia Hamilton's ''Anne of Cleves'' (1972), and Mary Saaler's ''Anne of Cleves: Fourth Wife of Henry VIII'' (1995), [[Elizabeth Norton]]'s ''Anne of Cleves: Henry VIII's Discarded Bride'' (2009), and Heather Darsie's ''Anna, Duchess of Cleves: The King's Beloved Sister'' (2019). Retha Warnicke has written an academic study on Anne's marriage called ''The Marrying of Anne of Cleves. Royal Protocol in Early Modern England'' (2000).\n\nAnne of Cleves appears as a character in many historical novels about Henry's reign. In ''[[The Fifth Queen]]'' (1906) by [[Ford Madox Ford]] she is portrayed as a sensible, practical woman who happily settles for  an annulment in return for  the material benefits it brings. Anne of Cleves is the main character of ''My Lady of Cleves'' (1946) by [[Margaret Campbell Barnes]]. About a third of ''[[The Boleyn Inheritance]]'' (2006) by [[Philippa Gregory]] is recounted from Anne's point of view, covering the period of Henry VIII's marriages to her and to her successor Catherine Howard. The book concludes with Anne living away from court, and avoiding the execution ceremonies of Howard and of [[Jane Boleyn]], sister-in-law to one of Henry's queens and lady-in-waiting to five of the others, including Anne. Gregory includes Anne in a non-fictional review of the period at the end of the book.\n\nAnne and her Holbein portrait in the Louvre are the focus of the novel ''Amenable Women'' (2009) by [[Mavis Cheek]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Annis |title=Amenable Women by Mavis Cheek |work=HistoricalNovels.info |url=http://www.historicalnovels.info/Amenable-Women.html |accessdate=2 April 2012 }}; {{cite web|title=Amenable Women, Mavis Cheek |work=Faber & Faber |url=http://www.faber.co.uk/work/amenable-women/9780571238965/ |accessdate=2 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515022239/http://www.faber.co.uk/work/amenable-women/9780571238965/ |archivedate=15 May 2009 }}</ref> Anne and Catherine Howard are the subject of ''The Queen's Mistake'' by Diane Haeger (2009), while Anne and Jane Seymour are covered in Volume 3 of Dixie Atkins's tetralogy ''A Golden Sorrow'' (2010). D. Lawrence-Young authored a [[biographical novel]] \"Anne of Cleves \u2013 Henry's Luckiest Wife\" published by GMTA/Celestial Press. N.C. USA, 2013.\n\nIn May 2019 [[Alison Weir]] released her fourth Six Tudor Queens Novel, ''Anna of Kleve: Queen of Secrets.'' The novel follows her throughout her life, first in Germany then Tudor England.\n\n==In film and television==\nThe role of Anne of Cleves was played by:\n* [[Elsa Lanchester]] in ''[[The Private Life of Henry VIII]]'', which was released in 1933.

{"title_page": "Television in China", "text_new": "{{other uses}}\n{{More citations needed|date=December 2008}}\n{{Chinese television topics}}\nThe '''television industry in [[China]]''' includes high-tech program production, transmission and coverage. [[China Central Television]] is China's largest and most powerful national television station. By 1987, two-thirds of people in China had access to television, while today, over 3,000 channels are available in the country.\n\n[[Chinese television drama]] has also proven to be a hot spot in today's popular culture (similar to [[Korean drama|K-dramas]]), with well received Chinese television dramas such as [[Princess Agents]], [[Nirvana in Fire]], [[The Journey of Flower]], [[Eternal Love (TV series)|Eternal Love]], [[The Princess Weiyoung]], [[Just One Smile Is Very Alluring]], [[The Legend of Mi Yue]], [[Scarlet Heart]], [[General and I]] and more garnering billions of views among China's most popular video websites, [[iQiyi]], [[Youku]], [[Tencent QQ|Tencent Video]] and [[Le.com|Le Video]]. Some dramas have been so popular and widely acclaimed that they were remade into different languages, as well as spinning off with a sequel.\n\nChinese variety scene has also became widely successful with popular shows such as [[Happy Camp (variety show)|Happy Camp]], [[Super Girl (TV series)|Super Girl]], [[Sing! China]] and more gaining worldwide recognition, garnering from millions to billions of viewership and winning numerous awards.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins ===\nWhen the [[People's Republic]] was founded in 1949, the telecommunications systems and facilities in China were outdated and rudimentary, and many had been damaged or destroyed during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Communications in China were established rapidly in the early 1950s. By 1952 the principal telecommunications network centered on [[Beijing]], and links to all large cities had finally been established, also launching [[television]] [[broadcast]]s. The first [[China|Chinese]] [[television station]] in the world was [[Rediffusion Television]] (now [[Asia Television|ATV]], have off-aired in 2016), which launched in [[Hong Kong]] on May 29, 1957. On the [[mainland China|mainland]], the first national broadcasts  began on May 1, 1958, and [[Beijing Television]] (now [[China Central Television]] since 1978) was formally launched on September 2, 1958. A month later would see the launch of the first regional station, [[Shanghai Television]], on the 9th [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]], which was on October 1, 1958. Liaoning Television would begin a year later, and in 1960, Zhejiang and Guandong provinces had their stations begin full broadcasts.\n\nGrowth in telecommunications halted with the general economic collapse after the [[Great Leap Forward]] (1958\u201360) but revived in the 1960s: radio-television service was installed in major cities in these years. By 1965 there were 12 [[television station]]s in mainland China, 1 national and 11 regional (compared to approximately 700 conventional television stations and about 3,000 [[cable television|cable]] [[channel (communications)|channels]] today). Similarly, in 1978, there was less than one [[television]] receiver per 100 people, and fewer than ten million Chinese had access to a television set (in 2003 there were about 35 TVs for every 100 people, and roughly a billion Chinese had access to television); expansion and modernization of the [[broadcasting]] systems continued throughout the late-1970s and early 1980s.\n\nUntil the mid-to-late 1970s, TV broadcasts started in the late afternoon and ended at midnight, with special daytime programs during the summer and winter vacations for students. BTV, at the same time, also expanded its programming reach, from the one channel the station started in 1958, the network grew to 3 channels in 1969.\n\nThe first [[China|Chinese]] color TV broadcast was launched by [[China Television]] in [[Taiwan]] in 1969. On the mainland, test color broadcasts started in 1971 on BTV Channel 2, and later spread towards the regional stations, and at the same time, BTV pioneered nationwide satellite broadcasts only for major events starting in 1972. BTV fully converted to color in 1973.\n\n=== 1980s ===\nThe Ministry of Radio and Television was established as a separate entity in 1982 to administer and upgrade the status of television and radio broadcasting. Subordinate to this ministry were the [[China National Radio|Central People's Broadcasting Station]], [[China Radio International|Radio Beijing]], and [[China Central Television]]. Additionally, the various broadcasting training, talent-search, research, publishing, and manufacturing organizations were brought under the control of the Ministry of Radio and Television. In 1986 responsibility for the movie industry was transferred from the Ministry of Culture to the new Ministry of Radio, Cinema, and Television.\n\nRadio and television expanded rapidly in the 1980s as important means of mass communication and popular entertainment. In 1982 television was by one measure available only to 350 million of China's population of 1 billion,<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{cite book |last1=Link |first1=Perry |title=The Uses of Literature: Life in the Socialist Chinese Literary System |date=2000 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9780691001982 |pages=208 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=qhBYxOitb-MC&pg=PA208&lpg=PA208&dq=number+of+tvs+in+china+1980&source=bl&ots=jIHu07O--a&sig=bP0vsF593FnFl3OtTJON9xIdgQs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=l9-mVPOhMJLioASN2YFI&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=number%20of%20tvs%20in%20china%201980&f=false}}</ref> and was mostly watched on a communal basis.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> By 1985 television reached two-thirds of the population through more than 104 stations (up from 52 in 1984 and 44 in 1983); an estimated 85 percent of the urban population had access to television. During this time, the content of the programming changed drastically from the political lectures and statistical lists of the previous period. Typical television shows were entertainment, including feature films, sports, drama,<ref>[[Ying Zhu]], Michael Keane, and Ruoyun Bai (editors), \"TV drama in China\", Hong Kong University Press, 2008</ref> music, dance, and children's programming. In 1985 a survey of a typical week of television programming made by the Shanghai publication ''Wuxiandian Yu Dianshi'' (Journal of Radio and Television) revealed that more than half of the programming could be termed entertainment; education made up 24 percent of the remainder of the programming and news 15 percent. A wide cross section of international news was presented each evening. Most news broadcasts had been borrowed from foreign news organizations, and a Chinese summary was [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] over. China Central Television also contracted with several foreign broadcasters for entertainment programs. Between 1982 and 1985, six United States television companies signed agreements to provide American programs to China.\n\nSince the late 1950s, people in [[Pearl River Delta]] began to receive channels from Hong Kong with [[Coaxial cable]] (1957-1973) and [[Yagi-Uda antenna]] (1967 onwards). Hong Kong channels were considered more entertaining and had Cantonese shows. Such reception was banned by central government, but semi-accepted by local government. By the late 1980s, local channels began to syndicate shows from Hong Kong.\n\nChina launched its first television-broadcast satellite in 1986.\n\nIn 1987 [[China Central Television]] (CCTV), the state network, managed China's television programs. In 1985 consumers purchased 15 million new sets, including approximately 4 million color sets. Production fell far short of demand. Because Chinese viewers often gathered in large groups to watch publicly owned sets, authorities estimated that two-thirds of the nation had access to television. In 1987 there were about 70 million television sets, an average of 29 sets per 100 families. CCTV had four channels that supplied programs to the over ninety television stations throughout the country. Construction began on a major new CCTV studio in Beijing in 1985. CCTV produced its own programs, a large portion of which were educational, and the Television University in Beijing produced three educational programs weekly. The English-language lesson was the most popular program and had an estimated 5 to 6 million viewers. Other programs included daily news, entertainment, teleplays, and special programs. Foreign programs included films and cartoons. Chinese viewers were particularly interested in watching international news, sports, and drama (see [[Culture of the People's Republic of China]]).\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn September 1993, after acquiring the [[Fox Networks Group Asia Pacific|STAR TV]] satellite network, [[Rupert Murdoch]] publicly declared:<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\">[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/22/chinathemedia.rupertmurdoch http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/apr/22/chinathemedia.rupertmurdoch]</ref> {{quote|\"(telecommunications) have proved an unambiguous threat to totalitarian regimes everywhere ... satellite broadcasting makes it possible for information-hungry residents of many closed societies to bypass state-controlled television channels\"}}\n\nAfter this, the former prime minister [[Li Peng]] requested and obtained the ban of [[satellite dish]]es throughout the country. Subsequently, the STAR TV network dropped the [[BBC]] channels from its satellite offer. This, and many ensuing declarations from Murdoch, led critics to believe the businessman was striving to appease the Chinese government in order to have the ban lifted.<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\"/> It is also alleged that the PRC government was unhappy with [[BBC]] coverage and threatened to block STAR TV in the huge [[mainland China|mainland Chinese]] market if the BBC was not withdrawn. This is despite technology that is capable of blocking BBC World in China, while making it available in other countries they serve.<ref>[http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2268 Announcing The P.u.-litzer Prizes For 1994<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"BBC re-enters China\">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1107470.stm | work=BBC News | title=China lets in BBC TV | date=2001-01-09 | accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref><ref>[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/startvhong/startvhong.htm Star-TV (Hong Kong)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn [[New Year's Day]] 1994 at 06:00 [[China Standard Time|Hangzhou Time]], [[Zhejiang Television]] was [[China]]'s first [[commercial broadcasting|commercial]] [[satellite television]] based in [[East China]] surrounding areas, [[Yangtze Delta]].\n\nOn 6 October 1997 at 09:00 [[China Standard Time|Hefei Time]], [[Anhui Television]] was [[China]]'s second [[commercial broadcasting|commercial]] [[satellite television]] and on 28 December same year at 06:00 [[China Standard Time|Nanjing Time]], [[Jiangsu Television]] was [[China]]'s third [[commercial broadcasting|commercial]] [[satellite television]] based in [[East China]] surrounding areas, [[Yangtze Delta]].\n\nOn 1 October 1998 at 06:00 [[China Standard Time|Shanghai Time]], [[Dragon Television|Dragon Television (Shanghai)]] (formerly known as [[Shanghai Television]]) was [[China]]'s fourth [[commercial broadcasting|commercial]] [[satellite television]] based in [[East China]] surrounding areas, [[Yangtze Delta]] ([[free-to-air]] [[terrestrial television]] in [[Shanghai]] only).\n\n=== 2000s ===\nIn 2000, the Chinese government put forward a goal of promoting media amalgamation by establishing trans-regional multi-media news groups. It also instituted detailed regulations on media industry fund raising, foreign-funded cooperation and trans-media development.<ref>[[Ying Zhu]], \"Television in Post-Reform China: Serial Dramas, Confucian Leadership and the Global Television Market\", London: Routledge, 2008.</ref>\n\nThe [[State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television]] (SARFT), founded at the end of 2001, integrated the resources of central-level radio, television and film industry plus those of the radio and television, Internet companies into China's biggest and strongest multi-media group covering the fields of television, Internet, publishing, advertising, etc. At the same time Chinese media industry is cooperating with overseas media groups.\n\nBy 2003, 30 overseas television networks, including [[Phoenix Television]], [[Bloomberg Television]], [[Fox Networks Group Asia Pacific|STAR TV]], [[Eurosport]], [[BBC World News|BBC World]], [[CNBC]], and [[China Entertainment Television]] had entered into China with limitations. At the same time, the [[CCTV News|English-language channel of CCTV]] entered the United States through [[Fox News]] Internet under the jurisdiction of [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]].\n\nIn conformity with trends in the international television industry, CCTV has made progress in the direction of specialization, introducing three specialized channels between 2003 and 2004, [[CCTV-13|CCTV-News]], [[CCTV-Children]] and [[CCTV-Music]].\n\nSince September 1, 2006, the Chinese government has banned foreign-produced animation between the hours of 5:00 to 8:00 P.M. on state-run television to protect struggling Chinese animation studios that have been affected by the popularity of such cartoons.<ref>McDonald, Joe.

[[Associated Press]]: August 13, 2006</ref>\n\nDespite these advances, a considerable gap remains between the eastern coastal region and the Chinese hinterland, where television sets and regional broadcasters are far less common.\n\n=== Today ===\nAltogether there are 3,000 television stations across the country. Large international TV expositions, including the Shanghai Television Festival, Beijing International Television Week, China Radio and Television Exposition and Sichuan Television Festival, are held on a regular basis.\n\nBesides judging and conferring awards, these festivals conduct academic exchange and the import and export of TV programs. Shanghai has become the largest television program trading market in Asia.\n\nSince China entered the [[World Trade Organization]], the trend within China's [[media industry]] is to form inter-media and trans-regional media groups operated with multiple patterns so as to meet competition and challenges from powerful overseas media groups.\n\nIn October 2014, actors and actresses who have used drugs, visited prostitutes, or broken the law are not allowed to appear on television, movies, or other forms of broadcast (radio and advertisement) in China. The ban also encompasses online media, film and publishing.<ref>{{cite news|title=China bans stars who have used drugs from national media|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-29549232|accessdate=10 October 2014|publisher=BBC News|date=9 October 2014}}</ref> ''[[China Daily]]'' reported that the ban is meant to \"keep the industry healthy\" and \"Celebrities who break the law should not be invited to appear in programs, and transmission of their words should be suspended.\" It was also noted that \"Recent cases involving stars using drugs or visiting prostitutes have harmed the image of the entertainment industry and set a bad example for young people.\" In 2014, China has detained several Chinese celebrities on drug-related charges.

The analog signals within the country will be switched off in stages between 2015 and 2018, due to large size of the territory. In the meantime, the policies emphasize the continued amalgamation of the three networks of Internet, television and telecom.\n\nTo realize the above goals, NDRC, MII and SARFT will be responsible for organizing special projects for implementing [[digital television]] services. Support will be given to digital TV related enterprises' listings and more investment will be injected into them.\n\nAccording to China's national strategy, the country aims to shift from a major television manufacturer to a digital television power during the development of digital television industry. The policies show that by 2010, the annual sales of China's digital television sets and related products will reach [[Renminbi|RMB]]250 billion and the export volume will reach [[US$]]10 billion. By 2015, China's digital television industry scale and technology level will rank among the top in the world and it will become one of the world's largest digital television set and key components development and production bases.\n\n== Cable television ==\nCable television is the usual transmission method in all urban areas of [[mainland China]] - television aerials are an extremely rare sight. Cable systems usually carry all the [[China Central Television|CCTV]] channels in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], plus all the channels of [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|municipal, provincial or regional]] station in question (such stations are listed below). The remaining slots carry the main channels from several other province-level stations, and may carry additional channels from metropolitan stations such as [[Beijing Television|BTV]] and [[Shanghai Media Group]]. They may also carry a local channel for a particular sub-provincial municipality, prefecture or county. Individual compounds (hotels, housing estates, etc.) often add a request channel showing karaoke [[music video]]s and animations. An extremely small number of compounds with many foreign residents (e.g. five star hotels in [[Beijing]]) will also carry selected channels from [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Western world|the West]]. [[Phoenix Television]] has the widest carriage under this rule.\n\nMainland China had more than 44.5 million digital cable television users in 2008, had 0.9 billion digital cable television users and 0.2 billion IPTV Users in 2015.\n\nUnlike many cable television operators in other countries that support two-way modes, China's cable television runs in a one-way mode (download only, no upload and no interactive services).\n\n==Most-viewed channels==\n===National commercial free-to-air satellite channel rating===\nTop 10 big major viewing ratings\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Position!!Channel!!Station/Network!!Launched!!% of China households reached!!# of households viewable\n|-\n|1||[[Anhui Television]]||[[Anhui Television|Anhui Radio and Television]]||{{birth date and age|1997|10|6}}||100%||~114,848,000\n|-\n|1||[[Jiangsu Television]]||[[Jiangsu Broadcasting Corporation]]||{{birth date and age|1997|12|28}}||100%||~114,848,000\n|-\n|1||[[Jiangsu Television|Jiangsu Youman]]||[[Jiangsu Broadcasting Corporation]]||{{birth date and age|2010|10|1}}||100%||~114,848,000\n|-\n|1||[[Dragon Television|Dragon Television (Shanghai)]]||[[Radio and Television Station of Shanghai]], [[Shanghai Media Group]]||{{birth date and age|1998|10|1}}||100%||~114,848,000\n|-\n|1||[[Shanghai Media Group|Shanghai Toonmax]]||[[Radio and Television Station of Shanghai]], [[Shanghai Media Group]]||{{birth date and age|2004|12|26}}||100%||~114,848,000\n|-\n|1||[[Zhejiang Television]]||[[Zhejiang Radio and Television Group]]||{{birth date and age|1994|1|1}}||100%||~114,848,000\n|-\n|1||[[Guangdong Television]]||[[Guangdong Radio and Television]]||{{birth date and age|1996|8|7}}||100%||~114,848,000\n|-\n|1||[[Television Southern|Southern Television Guangdong]]||[[Guangdong Radio and Television]]||{{birth date and age|2004|7|28}}||100%||~114,848,000\n|-\n|1||[[Guangdong Television|Guangdong Jiajia]]||[[Guangdong Radio and Television]]||{{birth date and age|2009|11|27}}||100%||~114,848,000\n|-\n|1||[[Shenzhen Television]]||[[Shenzhen Media Group]]||{{birth date and age|2004|6|28}}||100%||~114,848,000\n|}\n\n==List of national networks and channels==\n{{further|List of Chinese-language television channels}}\n\n===China Central Television===\n{{main|China Central Television}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! width=\"300\"| Name\n! width=\"200\"| Simplified Chinese\n! width=\"80\"| Launch\n!

[[China Central Television]] is China's largest and most powerful national television station. By 1987, two-thirds of people in China had access to television, while today, over 3,000 channels are available in the country.\n\n[[Chinese television drama]] has also proven to be a hot spot in today's popular culture (similar to [[Korean drama|K-dramas]]), with well received Chinese television dramas such as [[Princess Agents]], [[Nirvana in Fire]], [[The Journey of Flower]], [[Eternal Love (TV series)|Eternal Love]], [[The Princess Weiyoung]], [[Just One Smile Is Very Alluring]], [[The Legend of Mi Yue]], [[Scarlet Heart]], [[General and I]] and more garnering billions of views among China's most popular video websites, [[iQiyi]], [[Youku]], [[Tencent QQ|Tencent Video]] and [[Le.com|Le Video]]. Some dramas have been so popular and widely acclaimed that they were remade into different languages, as well as spinning off with a sequel.\n\nChinese variety scene has also became widely successful with popular shows such as [[Happy Camp (variety show)|Happy Camp]], [[Super Girl (TV series)|Super Girl]], [[Sing! China]] and more gaining worldwide recognition, garnering from millions to billions of viewership and winning numerous awards.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins ===\nWhen the [[People's Republic]] was founded in 1949, the telecommunications systems and facilities in China were outdated and rudimentary, and many had been damaged or destroyed during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Communications in China were established rapidly in the early 1950s. By 1952 the principal telecommunications network centered on [[Beijing]], and links to all large cities had finally been established, also launching [[television]] [[broadcast]]s. The first [[China|Chinese]] [[television station]] in the world was [[Rediffusion Television]] (now [[Asia Television|ATV]], have off-aired in 2016), which launched in [[Hong Kong]] on May 29, 1957. On the [[mainland China|mainland]], the first national broadcasts  began on May 1, 1958, and [[Beijing Television]] (now [[China Central Television]] since 1978) was formally launched on September 2, 1958. A month later would see the launch of the first regional station, [[Shanghai Television]], on the 9th [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]], which was on October 1, 1958. Liaoning Television would begin a year later, and in 1960, Zhejiang and Guandong provinces had their stations begin full broadcasts.\n\nGrowth in telecommunications halted with the general economic collapse after the [[Great Leap Forward]] (1958\u201360) but revived in the 1960s: radio-television service was installed in major cities in these years. By 1965 there were 12 [[television station]]s in mainland China, 1 national and 11 regional (compared to approximately 700 conventional television stations and about 3,000 [[cable television|cable]] [[channel (communications)|channels]] today). Similarly, in 1978, there was less than one [[television]] receiver per 100 people, and fewer than ten million Chinese had access to a television set (in 2003 there were about 35 TVs for every 100 people, and roughly a billion Chinese had access to television); expansion and modernization of the [[broadcasting]] systems continued throughout the late-1970s and early 1980s.\n\nUntil the mid-to-late 1970s, TV broadcasts started in the late afternoon and ended at midnight, with special daytime programs during the summer and winter vacations for students. BTV, at the same time, also expanded its programming reach, from the one channel the station started in 1958, the network grew to 3 channels in 1969.\n\nThe first [[China|Chinese]] color TV broadcast was launched by [[China Television]] in [[Taiwan]] in 1969. On the mainland, test color broadcasts started in 1971 on BTV Channel 2, and later spread towards the regional stations, and at the same time, BTV pioneered nationwide satellite broadcasts only for major events starting in 1972. BTV fully converted to color in 1973.\n\n=== 1980s ===\nThe Ministry of Radio and Television was established as a separate entity in 1982 to administer and upgrade the status of television and radio broadcasting. Subordinate to this ministry were the [[China National Radio|Central People's Broadcasting Station]], [[China Radio International|Radio Beijing]], and [[China Central Television]]. Additionally, the various broadcasting training, talent-search, research, publishing, and manufacturing organizations were brought under the control of the Ministry of Radio and Television. In 1986 responsibility for the movie industry was transferred from the Ministry of Culture to the new Ministry of Radio, Cinema, and Television.\n\nRadio and television expanded rapidly in the 1980s as important means of mass communication and popular entertainment. In 1982 television was by one measure available only to 350 million of China's population of 1 billion,<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{cite book |last1=Link |first1=Perry |title=The Uses of Literature: Life in the Socialist Chinese Literary System |date=2000 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9780691001982 |pages=208 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=qhBYxOitb-MC&pg=PA208&lpg=PA208&dq=number+of+tvs+in+china+1980&source=bl&ots=jIHu07O--a&sig=bP0vsF593FnFl3OtTJON9xIdgQs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=l9-mVPOhMJLioASN2YFI&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=number%20of%20tvs%20in%20china%201980&f=false}}</ref> and was mostly watched on a communal basis.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> By 1985 television reached two-thirds of the population through more than 104 stations (up from 52 in 1984 and 44 in 1983); an estimated 85 percent of the urban population had access to television. During this time, the content of the programming changed drastically from the political lectures and statistical lists of the previous period. Typical television shows were entertainment, including feature films, sports, drama,<ref>[[Ying Zhu]], Michael Keane, and Ruoyun Bai (editors), \"TV drama in China\", Hong Kong University Press, 2008</ref> music, dance, and children's programming. In 1985 a survey of a typical week of television programming made by the Shanghai publication ''Wuxiandian Yu Dianshi'' (Journal of Radio and Television) revealed that more than half of the programming could be termed entertainment; education made up 24 percent of the remainder of the programming and news 15 percent. A wide cross section of international news was presented each evening. Most news broadcasts had been borrowed from foreign news organizations, and a Chinese summary was [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] over. China Central Television also contracted with several foreign broadcasters for entertainment programs. Between 1982 and 1985, six United States television companies signed agreements to provide American programs to China.\n\nSince the late 1950s, people in [[Pearl River Delta]] began to receive channels from Hong Kong with [[Coaxial cable]] (1957-1973) and [[Yagi-Uda antenna]] (1967 onwards). Hong Kong channels were considered more entertaining and had Cantonese shows. Such reception was banned by central government, but semi-accepted by local government. By the late 1980s, local channels began to syndicate shows from Hong Kong.\n\nChina launched its first television-broadcast satellite in 1986.\n\nIn 1987 [[China Central Television]] (CCTV), the state network, managed China's television programs. In 1985 consumers purchased 15 million new sets, including approximately 4 million color sets. Production fell far short of demand. Because Chinese viewers often gathered in large groups to watch publicly owned sets, authorities estimated that two-thirds of the nation had access to television. In 1987 there were about 70 million television sets, an average of 29 sets per 100 families. CCTV had four channels that supplied programs to the over ninety television stations throughout the country. Construction began on a major new CCTV studio in Beijing in 1985. CCTV produced its own programs, a large portion of which were educational, and the Television University in Beijing produced three educational programs weekly. The English-language lesson was the most popular program and had an estimated 5 to 6 million viewers. Other programs included daily news, entertainment, teleplays, and special programs. Foreign programs included films and cartoons. Chinese viewers were particularly interested in watching international news, sports, and drama (see [[Culture of the People's Republic of China]]).\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn September 1993, after acquiring the [[Fox Networks Group Asia Pacific|STAR TV]] satellite network, [[Rupert Murdoch]] publicly declared:<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\">[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/22/chinathemedia.rupertmurdoch http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/apr/22/chinathemedia.rupertmurdoch]</ref> {{quote|\"(telecommunications) have proved an unambiguous threat to totalitarian regimes everywhere ... satellite broadcasting makes it possible for information-hungry residents of many closed societies to bypass state-controlled television channels\"}}\n\nAfter this, the former prime minister [[Li Peng]] requested and obtained the ban of [[satellite dish]]es throughout the country. Subsequently, the STAR TV network dropped the [[BBC]] channels from its satellite offer. This, and many ensuing declarations from Murdoch, led critics to believe the businessman was striving to appease the Chinese government in order to have the ban lifted.<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\"/> It is also alleged that the PRC government was unhappy with [[BBC]] coverage and threatened to block STAR TV in the huge [[mainland China|mainland Chinese]] market if the BBC was not withdrawn. This is despite technology that is capable of blocking BBC World in China, while making it available in other countries they serve.<ref>[http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2268 Announcing The P.u.-litzer Prizes For 1994<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"BBC re-enters China\">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1107470.stm | work=BBC News | title=China lets in BBC TV | date=2001-01-09 | accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref><ref>[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/startvhong/startvhong.htm Star-TV (Hong Kong)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn [[New Year's Day]] 1994 at 06:00 [[China Standard Time|Hangzhou Time]], [[Zhejiang Television]] was [[China]]'s first [[commercial broadcasting|commercial]] [[satellite television]] based in [[East China]] surrounding areas, [[Yangtze Delta]].\n\nOn 6 October 1997 at 09:00 [[China Standard Time|Hefei Time]], [[Anhui Television]] was [[China]]'s second [[commercial broadcasting|commercial]] [[satellite television]] and on 28 December same year at 06:00 [[China Standard Time|Nanjing Time]], [[Jiangsu Television]] was [[China]]'s third [[commercial broadcasting|commercial]] [[satellite television]] based in [[East China]] surrounding areas, [[Yangtze Delta]].\n\nOn 1 October 1998 at 06:00 [[China Standard Time|Shanghai Time]], [[Dragon Television|Dragon Television (Shanghai)]] (formerly known as [[Shanghai Television]]) was [[China]]'s fourth [[commercial broadcasting|commercial]] [[satellite television]] based in [[East China]] surrounding areas, [[Yangtze Delta]] ([[free-to-air]] [[terrestrial television]] in [[Shanghai]] only).\n\n=== 2000s ===\nIn 2000, the Chinese government put forward a goal of promoting media amalgamation by establishing trans-regional multi-media news groups. It also instituted detailed regulations on media industry fund raising, foreign-funded cooperation and trans-media development.<ref>[[Ying Zhu]], \"Television in Post-Reform China: Serial Dramas, Confucian Leadership and the Global Television Market\", London: Routledge, 2008.</ref>\n\nThe [[State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television]] (SARFT), founded at the end of 2001, integrated the resources of central-level radio, television and film industry plus those of the radio and television, Internet companies into China's biggest and strongest multi-media group covering the fields of television, Internet, publishing, advertising, etc. At the same time Chinese media industry is cooperating with overseas media groups.\n\nBy 2003, 30 overseas television networks, including [[Phoenix Television]], [[Bloomberg Television]], [[Fox Networks Group Asia Pacific|STAR TV]], [[Eurosport]], [[BBC World News|BBC World]], [[CNBC]], and [[China Entertainment Television]] had entered into China with limitations. At the same time, the [[CCTV News|English-language channel of CCTV]] entered the United States through [[Fox News]] Internet under the jurisdiction of [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]].\n\nIn conformity with trends in the international television industry, CCTV has made progress in the direction of specialization, introducing three specialized channels between 2003 and 2004, [[CCTV-13|CCTV-News]], [[CCTV-Children]] and [[CCTV-Music]].\n\nSince September 1, 2006, the Chinese government has banned foreign-produced animation between the hours of 5:00 to 8:00 P.M. on state-run television to protect struggling Chinese animation studios that have been affected by the popularity of such cartoons.<ref>McDonald, Joe.

[[Associated Press]]: August 13, 2006</ref>\n\nDespite these advances, a considerable gap remains between the eastern coastal region and the Chinese hinterland, where television sets and regional broadcasters are far less common.\n\n=== Today ===\nAltogether there are 3,000 television stations across the country. Large international TV expositions, including the Shanghai Television Festival, Beijing International Television Week, China Radio and Television Exposition and Sichuan Television Festival, are held on a regular basis.\n\nBesides judging and conferring awards, these festivals conduct academic exchange and the import and export of TV programs. Shanghai has become the largest television program trading market in Asia.\n\nSince China entered the [[World Trade Organization]], the trend within China's [[media industry]] is to form inter-media and trans-regional media groups operated with multiple patterns so as to meet competition and challenges from powerful overseas media groups.\n\nIn October 2014, actors and actresses who have used drugs, visited prostitutes, or broken the law are not allowed to appear on television, movies, or other forms of broadcast (radio and advertisement) in China. The ban also encompasses online media, film and publishing.<ref>{{cite news|title=China bans stars who have used drugs from national media|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-29549232|accessdate=10 October 2014|publisher=BBC News|date=9 October 2014}}</ref> ''[[China Daily]]'' reported that the ban is meant to \"keep the industry healthy\" and \"Celebrities who break the law should not be invited to appear in programs, and transmission of their words should be suspended.\" It was also noted that \"Recent cases involving stars using drugs or visiting prostitutes have harmed the image of the entertainment industry and set a bad example for young people.\" In 2014, China has detained several Chinese celebrities on drug-related charges.

The analog signals within the country will be switched off in stages between 2015 and 2018, due to large size of the territory. In the meantime, the policies emphasize the continued amalgamation of the three networks of Internet, television and telecom.\n\nTo realize the above goals, NDRC, MII and SARFT will be responsible for organizing special projects for implementing [[digital television]] services. Support will be given to digital TV related enterprises' listings and more investment will be injected into them.\n\nAccording to China's national strategy, the country aims to shift from a major television manufacturer to a digital television power during the development of digital television industry. The policies show that by 2010, the annual sales of China's digital television sets and related products will reach [[Renminbi|RMB]]250 billion and the export volume will reach [[US$]]10 billion. By 2015, China's digital television industry scale and technology level will rank among the top in the world and it will become one of the world's largest digital television set and key components development and production bases.\n\n== Cable television ==\nCable television is the usual transmission method in all urban areas of [[mainland China]] - television aerials are an extremely rare sight. Cable systems usually carry all the [[China Central Television|CCTV]] channels in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], plus all the channels of [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|municipal, provincial or regional]] station in question (such stations are listed below). The remaining slots carry the main channels from several other province-level stations, and may carry additional channels from metropolitan stations such as [[Beijing Television|BTV]] and [[Shanghai Media Group]]. They may also carry a local channel for a particular sub-provincial municipality, prefecture or county. Individual compounds (hotels, housing estates, etc.) often add a request channel showing karaoke [[music video]]s and animations. An extremely small number of compounds with many foreign residents (e.g. five star hotels in [[Beijing]]) will also carry selected channels from [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Western world|the West]]. [[Phoenix Television]] has the widest carriage under this rule.\n\nMainland China had more than 44.5 million digital cable television users in 2008, had 0.9 billion digital cable television users and 0.2 billion IPTV Users in 2015.\n\nUnlike many cable television operators in other countries that support two-way modes, China's cable television runs in a one-way mode (download only, no upload and no interactive services).\n\n==Most-viewed channels==\n===National commercial free-to-air satellite channel rating===\nTop 10 big major viewing ratings\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Position!!Channel!!Station/Network!!Launched!!% of China households reached!!# of households viewable\n|-\n|1||[[Anhui Television]]||[[Anhui Television|Anhui Radio and Television]]||{{birth date and age|1997|10|6}}||100%||~114,848,000\n|-\n|1||[[Jiangsu Television]]||[[Jiangsu Broadcasting Corporation]]||{{birth date and age|1997|12|28}}||100%||~114,848,000\n|-\n|1||[[Jiangsu Television|Jiangsu Youman]]||[[Jiangsu Broadcasting Corporation]]||{{birth date and age|2010|10|1}}||100%||~114,848,000\n|-\n|1||[[Dragon Television|Dragon Television (Shanghai)]]||[[Radio and Television Station of Shanghai]], [[Shanghai Media Group]]||{{birth date and age|1998|10|1}}||100%||~114,848,000\n|-\n|1||[[Shanghai Media Group|Shanghai Toonmax]]||[[Radio and Television Station of Shanghai]], [[Shanghai Media Group]]||{{birth date and age|2004|12|26}}||100%||~114,848,000\n|-\n|1||[[Zhejiang Television]]||[[Zhejiang Radio and Television Group]]||{{birth date and age|1994|1|1}}||100%||~114,848,000\n|-\n|1||[[Guangdong Television]]||[[Guangdong Radio and Television]]||{{birth date and age|1996|8|7}}||100%||~114,848,000\n|-\n|1||[[Television Southern|Southern Television Guangdong]]||[[Guangdong Radio and Television]]||{{birth date and age|2004|7|28}}||100%||~114,848,000\n|-\n|1||[[Guangdong Television|Guangdong Jiajia]]||[[Guangdong Radio and Television]]||{{birth date and age|2009|11|27}}||100%||~114,848,000\n|-\n|1||[[Shenzhen Television]]||[[Shenzhen Media Group]]||{{birth date and age|2004|6|28}}||100%||~114,848,000\n|}\n\n==List of national networks and channels==\n{{further|List of Chinese-language television channels}}\n\n===China Central Television===\n{{main|China Central Television}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! width=\"300\"| Name\n! width=\"200\"| Simplified Chinese\n! width=\"80\"| Launch\n!

His rise as the most powerful peripheral emirs of the Seljuq empire was aided by the necessity of having a large army against the frequent incursions from the neighboring [[Kingdom of Georgia]]. He made himself virtually independent ruler of Azerbaijan by 1146. His marriage with [[Mu'mine Khatun]], the widow of Sultan Toghrul II (1132\u20131133; Masud's brother and predecessor) afforded him to intervene in the dynastic strife which erupted upon Mas'ud's death in 1152. He succeeded, in 1160, in deposing Sulayman Shah and installing his stepson Arslan b. Toghrul (1160\u20131175) as sultan. Conferred with the rank of atabek, Ildeniz now became a chief protector of the sultan's authority.\n\nIldeniz then arranged a marriage between his son Pahlawan and the daughter of Inanch, amir of [[Rey, Iran|Rey]], in order to secure the allegiance of this powerful dynasty. Later Inanch allied himself with the amirs of [[Fars Province|Fars]] and [[Qazvin (city)|Qazvin]] and attempted to depose Arslan in favor of his brother Muhammad. Ildeniz met the renegades on a battlefield and won a victory, but Inanch escaped to Rey. Ildeniz then marched to [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]] and forced the atabek of Fars, Zangi, into submission. Soon he proceeded northward to recover the city of [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]] from the Georgian attack in 1162. A coalition of [[Muslim]] rulers led by Ildeniz defeated the Georgian king [[George III of Georgia|Giorgi III]] and forced him to withdraw into his possessions. Back at [[Hamadan]], he had to deal with another invasion \u2013 this time by the [[Khwarezmia]]ns who planned to annex [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. The Khwarezminas avoided the confrontation and retreated in the face of the advancing army of Ildeniz. Their ally Inanch was murdered at the request of Ildeniz in 1169. It was not, however, until the death of the [[Khwarazmshah]] Il-Arslan in 1172, when the threats on this sector were finally eliminated.\n\nBy the time of his death around 1175\u20131176, Ildeniz was arguably the undisputed de facto master of many parts of the already fragmentized Great Seljuq  Empire, centered on [[Iraq]]. He was buried at Hamadan, at a [[madrasa]] which he had founded.  He was succeeded by his sons [[Muhammad Jahan Pahlavan]] and [[Qizil Arslan]].\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite encyclopedia | article = At\u0101bak\u0101n-e Adharbayj\u0101n | last = Luther | first = K.
