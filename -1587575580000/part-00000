It is an occasion for Shias to discuss [[Allah]] and the [[Ahlul Bayt]] and to strengthen ties among the community with love and compassion.\n\n===Births===\n* 1 Rajab: [[Muhammad al-Baqir|Muhammad al-B\u0101qir]], [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Sh\u012b\u2018ah Im\u0101m]]\n* 5 Rajab: \u2018Al\u012b al-Naq\u012b, Twelver Im\u0101m\n* 9 Rajab: [[Ali al-Asghar ibn Husayn|\u2018Al\u012b al-Asghar]]\n* 12 Rajab: [[Muhammad al-Taqi|Muhammad al-Taq\u012b]], ninth Twelver Im\u0101m\n* 4 Rajab: [[Bande Nawaz|Khwaja Banda Nawaz]]\n* 13 Rajab: [[Ali|\u2018Al\u012b ibn Ab\u012b T\u0101lib]]\n* 20 Rajab: [[Sakina bint Hussain]]\n\n===Deaths===\n* 3 Rajab: [[Ali al-Hadi|\u2018Al\u012b al-Naq\u012b]], Twelver Imam & [[Uwais al-Qarni]]\n* 6 Rajab: [[Muinuddin Chishti|Mu'\u012bnudd\u012bn Chisht\u012b]], The founder of [[Chishti Order]] of [[Sufism]]\n* 8 Rajab: [[Nazim Al-Haqqani]], a Turkish Cypriot Sufi Muslim sheykh and spiritual leader of the Naqshbandi tariqa.\n* 15 Rajab: [[Zainab bint Ali]]\n* 18 Rajab: [[Islamic views on Abraham|Abraham]] (according to Shi'a Islam)\n* 22 Rajab: [[Muawiyah I]]\n* 25 Rajab: [[Musa al-Kadhim|Mus\u0101' al-K\u0101dhim]], seventh Twelver Imam\n* 26 Rajab: [[Abu Talib ibn Abdul Muttalib]], uncle of [[Muhammad]] and father of [[Ali]]\n\n==Description==\nThe name of Rajab literally designated to the meaning respected, regarded, and admired. It seems that the word is originally a [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] one. There are different points about the numeration of the days of the month. Some believe that the month is 29 days and others believe that the month is 30 days. There are two important events during the month, namely the birthday of [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] and [[Muhammad's first revelation|the Muhammad's first revelation]] in Shia tradition.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://rch.ac.ir/article/Details/12659|author=Farid Ghasemlou|date=2014|title=Rajab}}</ref> Just as the month honored before the appearance of Islam, the dignity of that is regarded by the very religion of [[Islam]]. Also during the month referred to the forbidding of war. There are also other names for the Rajab, such as Rajab Al-Morrajjab, Rajab Al-Asab.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://rch.ac.ir/article/Details/12659|author=Mohsen Moeini|date=2014|title=Rajab}}</ref>\n\n===For Shia===\n\n[[Shia Islam|The Shi'a]] believe that there are many virtues of the month. According to some narrations, the month belongs to [[Ali]] while [[Sha'ban|Shaban]] is for [[Muhammad]].

In 2012, he stated, \"I remember specifically finishing ''[[Year in the Kingdom]]'' and then beginning to work on what would become ''[[Singing Ax]]'', and I clearly knew ''Singing Ax'' was going to be the last \"J. Tillman\" record ever because I just didn't want to do it anymore.\"<ref name=\"No Depression\">{{cite web |last=Mateer |first=Chris |url=http://www.nodepression.com/profiles/blogs/interview-father-john-misty-josh-tillman-delivers-fear-fun |title=Interview: Father John Misty (Josh Tillman) Delivers \"Fear Fun\" - No Depression Americana and Roots Music |publisher=Nodepression.com |date=2012-04-30 |accessdate=2013-09-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130130201219/http://www.nodepression.com/profiles/blogs/interview-father-john-misty-josh-tillman-delivers-fear-fun |archivedate=2013-01-30 }}</ref>\n\nUnderlining this change in character and the choosing of the new moniker, Tillman admits the following in an interview for the Dallas Observer: \"I used to do these J. Tillman shows and I would play my sad-wizard, Dungeons and Dragons music and watch people's eyes glaze over [...] Then, in between songs, I would start being myself and shooting the shit and telling jokes. ... All of a sudden, people were rapt with attention and I had this very devastating and sobering realization that I was way better at that part of the show than the music part.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Hopkins |first=Daniel |url=http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/dc9/2012/05/just_who_is_father_john_misty.php |title=Just Who Is Father John Misty? |publisher=Blogs.dallasobserver.com |date=2012-05-24 |accessdate=2013-09-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021213821/http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/dc9/2012/05/just_who_is_father_john_misty.php |archive-date=2013-10-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the quote above Tillman states that personally he wasn't pleased with the slow and sad style his music was often associated with: \"Songwriting for me had always only been interesting and necessary because I saw it as this vehicle for truth, but I had this realization that all I had really done with it was lick my wounds for years and years, and become more and more isolated from people and experiences. I don\u2019t even like wound-licking music, I want to listen to someone rip their arm off and beat themselves with it. I don\u2019t believe that until now I\u2019ve ever put anything at risk in my music. I was hell-bent on putting my preciousness at stake in order to find something worth singing about.\"<ref name=\"Sub Pop\">{{cite web|url=http://www.subpop.com/channel/blog/father_john_misty_to_release_fear_fun_on_may_1st_2012 |title=Sub Pop Records |publisher=Subpop.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-03}}</ref>\n\nThis contrast between the music he was making and the person he really was led to a crisis concerning his work as a musician: \"I lost all interest in writing music, or identifying as a \u2018songwriter\u2019. I got into my van with enough mushrooms to choke a horse and started driving down the coast with nowhere to go. After a few weeks, I was writing a novel, which is where I finally found my narrative voice. The voice that is actually useful. It was a while before that voice started manifesting in a musical way, but once I settled in the Laurel Canyon spider-shack where I\u2019m living now, I spent months demoing all these weird-ass songs about weird-ass experiences almost in real-time, and kind of had this musical \u2018Oh-there-I-am\u2019 moment, identical to how I felt when I was writing the book. It was unbelievably liberating. I knew there was never any going back to the place I was writing from before, which was a huge relief. The monkey got banished off my back.\"<ref name=\"Sub Pop\"/>\n\nThe \"monkey\" he's speaking about is specified in an interview for No Depression as a wrong idea of oneself: \"When I was in high school I wanted to be an obscure singer-songwriter. I really wanted to be one of those guys that nobody knew about, and in some weird way, I fulfilled that. It all makes perfect sense to me. I wanted to be like [[Townes Van Zandt]], [[Nick Drake]], or [[Gram Parsons]]. Somebody who was respected but unknown. That was the most romantic thing to me. Guys like [[Richard Buckner (musician)|Richard Buckner]]. And as I was doing those records, I felt like I was part of the club, and I got to meet some of those guys. It was like I got invited into the inner sanctum. I was really into it for a long time, but I just ran out of things to do in it. [...] At some point, I realized that in order to go where I needed to go, and where I wanted to creatively, I had to kill that mythology and I had to kill that idea. I said to myself \"You are not \"that\", you are a man.\" You have to not want to be anyone else, or want to be \"anything\" else. You have to just be what you are. I realized that I am a smart-ass, and that I have always been a kind of smart-ass. So when I realized that, I realized that I had an obligation to start including my sense of humor and my actual, true, conversational voice in my music in order for it to be exclusive to me, and not to be just my best stab at trying to be a preexisting idea.\"<ref name=\"No Depression\"/>\n\nNot fulfilling preexisting ideas Tillman used some sort of arbitrariness finding his new moniker 'Father John Misty'. For TheVine he explained himself as following: \"I had to give it a name, so I kind of wanted to confuse people with this ridiculous red herring [and] admittedly patently ridiculous name that\u2019s also phonetically beautifully and looks good in print. Sort of a name I\u2019ve decided to give to this weird, subconscious, dream fragmentation I have of this homosexual, shamanic drifter who bounces around [and] stirs up weird shit in my dreams. Like making out with my brother. So I guess the aggregate of all those things just felt right.

Tillman'''. In 2012, he stated, \"I remember specifically finishing ''[[Year in the Kingdom]]'' and then beginning to work on what would become ''[[Singing Ax]]'', and I clearly knew ''Singing Ax'' was going to be the last \"J. Tillman\" record ever because I just didn't want to do it anymore.\"<ref name=\"No Depression\">{{cite web |last=Mateer |first=Chris |url=http://www.nodepression.com/profiles/blogs/interview-father-john-misty-josh-tillman-delivers-fear-fun |title=Interview: Father John Misty (Josh Tillman) Delivers \"Fear Fun\" - No Depression Americana and Roots Music |publisher=Nodepression.com |date=2012-04-30 |accessdate=2013-09-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130130201219/http://www.nodepression.com/profiles/blogs/interview-father-john-misty-josh-tillman-delivers-fear-fun |archivedate=2013-01-30 }}</ref>\n\nUnderlining this change in character and the choosing of the new moniker, Tillman admits the following in an interview for the Dallas Observer: \"I used to do these J. Tillman shows and I would play my sad-wizard, Dungeons and Dragons music and watch people's eyes glaze over [...] Then, in between songs, I would start being myself and shooting the shit and telling jokes. ... All of a sudden, people were rapt with attention and I had this very devastating and sobering realization that I was way better at that part of the show than the music part.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Hopkins |first=Daniel |url=http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/dc9/2012/05/just_who_is_father_john_misty.php |title=Just Who Is Father John Misty? |publisher=Blogs.dallasobserver.com |date=2012-05-24 |accessdate=2013-09-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021213821/http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/dc9/2012/05/just_who_is_father_john_misty.php |archive-date=2013-10-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the quote above Tillman states that personally he wasn't pleased with the slow and sad style his music was often associated with: \"Songwriting for me had always only been interesting and necessary because I saw it as this vehicle for truth, but I had this realization that all I had really done with it was lick my wounds for years and years, and become more and more isolated from people and experiences. I don\u2019t even like wound-licking music, I want to listen to someone rip their arm off and beat themselves with it. I don\u2019t believe that until now I\u2019ve ever put anything at risk in my music. I was hell-bent on putting my preciousness at stake in order to find something worth singing about.\"<ref name=\"Sub Pop\">{{cite web|url=http://www.subpop.com/channel/blog/father_john_misty_to_release_fear_fun_on_may_1st_2012 |title=Sub Pop Records |publisher=Subpop.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-03}}</ref>\n\nThis contrast between the music he was making and the person he really was led to a crisis concerning his work as a musician: \"I lost all interest in writing music, or identifying as a \u2018songwriter\u2019. I got into my van with enough mushrooms to choke a horse and started driving down the coast with nowhere to go. After a few weeks, I was writing a novel, which is where I finally found my narrative voice. The voice that is actually useful. It was a while before that voice started manifesting in a musical way, but once I settled in the Laurel Canyon spider-shack where I\u2019m living now, I spent months demoing all these weird-ass songs about weird-ass experiences almost in real-time, and kind of had this musical \u2018Oh-there-I-am\u2019 moment, identical to how I felt when I was writing the book. It was unbelievably liberating. I knew there was never any going back to the place I was writing from before, which was a huge relief. The monkey got banished off my back.\"<ref name=\"Sub Pop\"/>\n\nThe \"monkey\" he's speaking about is specified in an interview for No Depression as a wrong idea of oneself: \"When I was in high school I wanted to be an obscure singer-songwriter. I really wanted to be one of those guys that nobody knew about, and in some weird way, I fulfilled that. It all makes perfect sense to me. I wanted to be like [[Townes Van Zandt]], [[Nick Drake]], or [[Gram Parsons]]. Somebody who was respected but unknown. That was the most romantic thing to me. Guys like [[Richard Buckner (musician)|Richard Buckner]]. And as I was doing those records, I felt like I was part of the club, and I got to meet some of those guys. It was like I got invited into the inner sanctum. I was really into it for a long time, but I just ran out of things to do in it. [...] At some point, I realized that in order to go where I needed to go, and where I wanted to creatively, I had to kill that mythology and I had to kill that idea. I said to myself \"You are not \"that\", you are a man.\" You have to not want to be anyone else, or want to be \"anything\" else. You have to just be what you are. I realized that I am a smart-ass, and that I have always been a kind of smart-ass. So when I realized that, I realized that I had an obligation to start including my sense of humor and my actual, true, conversational voice in my music in order for it to be exclusive to me, and not to be just my best stab at trying to be a preexisting idea.\"<ref name=\"No Depression\"/>\n\nNot fulfilling preexisting ideas Tillman used some sort of arbitrariness finding his new moniker 'Father John Misty'. For TheVine he explained himself as following: \"I had to give it a name, so I kind of wanted to confuse people with this ridiculous red herring [and] admittedly patently ridiculous name that\u2019s also phonetically beautifully and looks good in print. Sort of a name I\u2019ve decided to give to this weird, subconscious, dream fragmentation I have of this homosexual, shamanic drifter who bounces around [and] stirs up weird shit in my dreams. Like making out with my brother. So I guess the aggregate of all those things just felt right. But really and truly, the whole thing is just kind of about the fact that it really doesn\u2019t matter what the fuck you call yourself, as long as the goods are in the explicit honesty.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thevine.com.au/music/interviews/father-john-misty---interview/ |title=Father John Misty: \"Typically people want boring dudes who play nice music.\" - Life & pop culture, untangled |publisher=TheVine |date=2012-06-12 |accessdate=2013-09-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526033037/http://www.thevine.com.au/music/interviews/father-john-misty---interview |archive-date=2013-05-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| total_length    = 43:24\n| collapsed       = no\n| headline        = \n| all_writing     = [[Josh Tillman]]\n\n| title1          = Funtimes in Babylon\n| length1         = 3:39\n\n| title2          = Nancy from Now On\n| length2         = 3:54\n\n| title3          = [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery Sings / Drive|Hollywood Forever Cemetery Sings]]\n| length3         = 3:10\n\n| title4          = I'm Writing a Novel\n| length4         = 3:35\n\n| title5          = O I Long to Feel Your Arms Around Me\n| length5         = 2:23\n\n| title6          = Misty's Nightmares 1 & 2\n| length6         = 3:13\n\n| title7          = Only Son of the Ladiesman\n| length7         = 4:09\n\n| title8          = This Is Sally Hatchet\n| length8         = 3:57\n\n| title9          = Well, You Can Do It Without Me\n| length9         = 2:43\n\n| title10         = Now I'm Learning to Love the War\n| length10        = 4:16\n\n| title11         = Tee Pees 1\u201312\n| length11        = 3:16\n\n| title12         = Everyman Needs a Companion\n| length12        = 5:19\n}}\n\n==Music videos==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Since the demise of [[Apartheid]] it remains a societal and an institutionalised problem.\n\n==sicko mode or mo obamba==\n\nchads are superior kyles fat\n\n==Apartheid racism==\n\n{{See also|Apartheid}}\n[[Apartheid]] (Afrikaans pronunciation: {{IPA-af|a\u02c8part\u0266\u0259it|}}; an Afrikaans word meaning \"separateness\", or \"the state of being apart\", literally \"apart-hood\") was a system of racial segregation in South Africa enforced through legislation by the National Party (NP), the governing party from 1948 to 1994. Under apartheid, the rights, associations, and movements of the majority black inhabitants and other ethnic groups were curtailed, and white minority rule was maintained. Apartheid was developed after World War II by the [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner]]-dominated National Party and Broederbond organizations. The ideology was also enforced in South West Africa, which was administered by South Africa under a League of Nations mandate (revoked in 1966 via United Nations Resolution 2145), until it gained independence as Namibia in 1990. By extension, the term is currently used for forms of systematic segregation established by the state authority in a country against the social and civil rights of a certain group of citizens due to ethnic prejudices.\n\nThe Indian community has been subject to Zulu racist attacks dating back to the arrival of indentured labor in South Africa which ultimately resulted in the [[Durban Riots]] of 1949 followed by riots in 1985 where homes for 1500 Indians were set on fire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-08-09/news/mn-2323_1_black-youths|title=Zulus Attack Indians Near Durban; Death Toll Mounts|first=United Press|last=International|date=9 August 1985|publisher=|via=LA Times}}</ref>\n\n=== Governmental racism under Apartheid ===\nThe first example of apartheid legislation was the ''[[Population Registration Act]]''. This act was the first to force citizens to be registered under their race, and this set the stage for later racial tension. One example of apartheid legislation was the ''[[Promotion of Bantu Self-government Act, 1959|Promotion of Bantu Self-Government Act]]'', which was passed into law in 1959. This law forced White citizens to live in separate areas than Black citizens, and reserved much less land for the Black citizens to live, despite them making up a large majority of the population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/history-apartheid-south-africa|title=A history of Apartheid in South Africa|last=sahoboss|date=2016-05-06|website=South African History Online|language=en|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref> The way the South African government did this at the time was by reserving off pieces of land called [[Bantustans]], and forcing the Black South Africans on to these pieces of land. There were 10 different Bantustans in total, all for separate ethnic groups. Once they moved on to these lands, the Black South Africans lost their rights as South Africans, and were forced to become permanent residents of the reserves. They were expected to run their own governments once they had arrived. \u00a0Economic conditions on these lands were not satisfactory for the people there, as the South African government put minimal effort policy-wise into developing these regions economically. Most of the time, residents of Bantustans would have to commute hours by bus or train to industrial zones on the border of their Bantustan. Even though the South African Government put lots of money towards trying to keep the Bantustans viable, the local governments were still plagued by corruption, so normal people rarely felt the effects of the government money. In the 1970\u2019s 4 of these Bantustans became independent and separated entirely from the South African government, and this was the intent of the Bantustans. To keep all the Black citizens out from South Africa.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Laura|date=2017-07-27|title=History of South Africa's Bantustans|url=http://oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.001.0001/acrefore-9780190277734-e-80|journal=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of African History|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.013.80|isbn=9780190277734}}</ref>\n\nAnother example of restricting legislation in South Africa is the ''Natives (Abolition of Passes and Coordination of Documents) Act of 1952''. This act forced Black South African citizens to carry their passbooks with them at all times. If someone was found without their passbook, they could be arrested for no reason other than that. This caused immense anger within the Black community, which would eventually spark the defiance campaign of 1952.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/pass-laws-south-africa-1800-1994|title=Pass laws in South Africa 1800-1994|last=sahoboss|date=2011-03-21|website=South African History Online|language=en|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref>\n\nThe oppressive nature of these apartheid laws sparked some resistance within the Black South African community, and several oppositional groups were formed. One of these groups that emerged was the ANC ([[African National Congress]]), a group which eventually became involved in many resistance activities. One movement the ANC got involved in was a defiance campaign in the Black suburb of Sharpeville. This eventually led to the [[Sharpeville massacre]], where 69 Black South Africans were killed, and 180 more were injured. This event resulted in the bloodiest apartheid protest that South Africa would see, and in the moment the Black South African community was horrified. In response, the following week was full of demonstrations, protests and marches. Because of this, the South African government saw fit to declare a state of emergency, and arrested thousands of people who had been protesting. Numbers approached 10,000 people by May, and many of these people were not released for months afterwards. Also in the fallout of the Sharpeville massacre, the South African government banned any organisations that were considered a threat to public safety or public order. This included organisations such as the ANC and the PAC (another organisation that was committed to activism for Black South Africans through peaceful protesting).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blackpast.org/global-african-history/sharpeville-massacre/|title=Sharpeville Massacre \u2022 BlackPast|date=2009-02-22|website=BlackPast|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref>\u00a0\n\nUnder apartheid, Black women were affected to an extreme degree due to discriminatory racial and gender laws. There were not many opportunities for women to become \u00a0political leaders, as many organisations allowed male membership only, so not many women did get very involved with politics. There were several organizations that let women join, or had entirely separate organizations there for women to join, one such being the ANCWL or ANC Women\u2019s League. In a protest of the ''[[Natives (Abolition of Passes and Co-ordination of Documents) Act|Natives (Abolition of Passes and Coordination of Documents) Act of 1952]]'' as mentioned above and several other pieces of legislation, many women participated in movements against the government for the first time in the form of the Defiance campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/women-and-struggle-against-apartheid|title=Women and the struggle against Apartheid &#124; South African History Online|website=www.sahistory.org.za}}</ref> The defiance campaign was a movement organized in part by the ANC because of new apartheid legislation from the government. Women were not the only people to take part in this campaign, but the inclusion of women is noteworthy because this was the first campaign to see major participation from women. The movement itself involved thousands of Black citizens doing nonviolent things that would normally be considered as civil disobedience, such as going into areas that only White people were allowed into, or burning their pass books. The idea behind the movement, was that if enough Black people flooded the South African prison and judicial system, then it would force the government to reform the apartheid laws. Thousands of people were arrested in a matter of months, but the campaign did not accomplish its goal of forcing radical change. However, it did capture the attention of the global community, and that of the United Nations. In time the UN would launch an investigation into the apartheid policy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/defiance-campaign-1952|title=Defiance Campaign 1952|last=Anonymous|date=2011-03-21|website=South African History Online|language=en|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980's, resistance to apartheid became extreme. The [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]] was formed in order to try and unite people all over to join in the fight against government oppression. The leader of the front, [[Allan Boesak]], called for organizations all over South Africa to help him. This included churches, civic associations, trade unions, student organizations, and sports bodies. The UDF became extremely popular among the Black community, and helped unite everyone who was fighting for equality, something that had not happened in the past. The government\u2019s response was to declare another national emergency, and again South Africa saw thousands of arrests and hundreds of killing. However by 1990, the burden of so much public violence was too much. The government was losing its tight grip on the country, and eventually the state president, [[F. W. de Klerk|F.W. de Klerk]], decided that reform was absolutely necessary.

Since the demise of [[Apartheid]] it remains a societal and an institutionalised problem.\n\n==Colonial racism==\n\nDuring the Colonial era, the Cape served as strategic base for the Colonial expansionist interests in the east. For this purpose settlements were established by the [[Dutch East India Company]] at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1652, followed by Britain seizing the Cape Colony in 1806 during the Napoleonic wars, resulting in some areas being governed by the British and some by the Dutch.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/South-Africa|title=South Africa - Growth of the colonial economy|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref>\n\nThe region attracted ivory and slave traders who imported slaves for wheat farming and viticulture to serve the European settlements. In response to Colonial subjugation, fleeing black natives and slaves, joined existing groups such as the Xhosa or formed groups that were headed by warlords such as those of Bloem, Kok and Barends families. By the late 18th century, Arabs and Europeans traded beads, brass, cloth, alcohol and firearms in return for slaves, ivory, gold, wax, cattle and skins. The profits from these trade practices encouraged the warlords to hunt elephants and slaves by raiding the local communities such as Rolong, Tlhaping, Huruthshe and Ngwaketse. During the [[Difaqane]], the [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]] under [[Shaka]] overran many smaller tribes and enslaved them.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nAlthough slavery was formally abolished in 1833 with the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Slavery Abolition Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom]], slaves were continued to be imported from Britain's established settlements in India and the East Indies. The practice of importing slaves from India stretches back to the 1600s when the Dutch bought slaves from various parts of India who were sold by the then Muslim rulers. By the early part of the 18th century, 80% of the slaves were South Asians who were not just from the Indian subcontinent but also those South Asians who were living in South-East Asian countries such as Java.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/history-slavery-and-early-colonisation-south-africa|title=History of slavery and early colonisation in South Africa &#124; South African History Online|website=www.sahistory.org.za}}</ref>\n\nThe Roman-Dutch law defined slaves as property that could be traded, bought and sold, a form of slavery known as '[[chattel slavery]]'. There are many examples of racism and discriminatory practices during the Colonial period such as whipping, starvation, being forced to work for long hours, laborers having to carry passes, being subject to high taxation, not being able to walk on the sidewalks, banned from living, entering or working in certain areas such as the Orange Free State.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Other examples include allocation of rations during the [[Siege of Ladysmith]].\n\n{{quote|\nFor Whites\u2014Biscuit, 1/4 lb.; Maize meal, 3 oz.<br/>\nFor Indians and Kaffirs\u2014Maize meal, 8 oz.<br/>\nEuropeans\u2014Fresh meat, 1 lb.<br/>\nKaffirs\u2014Fresh meat, 1-1/4 lbs.

Under apartheid, the rights, associations, and movements of the majority black inhabitants and other ethnic groups were curtailed, and white minority rule was maintained. Apartheid was developed after World War II by the [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner]]-dominated National Party and Broederbond organizations. The ideology was also enforced in South West Africa, which was administered by South Africa under a League of Nations mandate (revoked in 1966 via United Nations Resolution 2145), until it gained independence as Namibia in 1990. By extension, the term is currently used for forms of systematic segregation established by the state authority in a country against the social and civil rights of a certain group of citizens due to ethnic prejudices.\n\nThe Indian community has been subject to Zulu racist attacks dating back to the arrival of indentured labor in South Africa which ultimately resulted in the [[Durban Riots]] of 1949 followed by riots in 1985 where homes for 1500 Indians were set on fire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-08-09/news/mn-2323_1_black-youths|title=Zulus Attack Indians Near Durban; Death Toll Mounts|first=United Press|last=International|date=9 August 1985|publisher=|via=LA Times}}</ref>\n\n=== Governmental racism under Apartheid ===\nThe first example of apartheid legislation was the ''[[Population Registration Act]]''. This act was the first to force citizens to be registered under their race, and this set the stage for later racial tension. One example of apartheid legislation was the ''[[Promotion of Bantu Self-government Act, 1959|Promotion of Bantu Self-Government Act]]'', which was passed into law in 1959. This law forced White citizens to live in separate areas than Black citizens, and reserved much less land for the Black citizens to live, despite them making up a large majority of the population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/history-apartheid-south-africa|title=A history of Apartheid in South Africa|last=sahoboss|date=2016-05-06|website=South African History Online|language=en|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref> The way the South African government did this at the time was by reserving off pieces of land called [[Bantustans]], and forcing the Black South Africans on to these pieces of land. There were 10 different Bantustans in total, all for separate ethnic groups. Once they moved on to these lands, the Black South Africans lost their rights as South Africans, and were forced to become permanent residents of the reserves. They were expected to run their own governments once they had arrived. \u00a0Economic conditions on these lands were not satisfactory for the people there, as the South African government put minimal effort policy-wise into developing these regions economically. Most of the time, residents of Bantustans would have to commute hours by bus or train to industrial zones on the border of their Bantustan. Even though the South African Government put lots of money towards trying to keep the Bantustans viable, the local governments were still plagued by corruption, so normal people rarely felt the effects of the government money. In the 1970\u2019s 4 of these Bantustans became independent and separated entirely from the South African government, and this was the intent of the Bantustans. To keep all the Black citizens out from South Africa.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Laura|date=2017-07-27|title=History of South Africa's Bantustans|url=http://oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.001.0001/acrefore-9780190277734-e-80|journal=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of African History|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.013.80|isbn=9780190277734}}</ref>\n\nAnother example of restricting legislation in South Africa is the ''Natives (Abolition of Passes and Coordination of Documents) Act of 1952''. This act forced Black South African citizens to carry their passbooks with them at all times. If someone was found without their passbook, they could be arrested for no reason other than that. This caused immense anger within the Black community, which would eventually spark the defiance campaign of 1952.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/pass-laws-south-africa-1800-1994|title=Pass laws in South Africa 1800-1994|last=sahoboss|date=2011-03-21|website=South African History Online|language=en|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref>\n\nThe oppressive nature of these apartheid laws sparked some resistance within the Black South African community, and several oppositional groups were formed. One of these groups that emerged was the ANC ([[African National Congress]]), a group which eventually became involved in many resistance activities. One movement the ANC got involved in was a defiance campaign in the Black suburb of Sharpeville. This eventually led to the [[Sharpeville massacre]], where 69 Black South Africans were killed, and 180 more were injured. This event resulted in the bloodiest apartheid protest that South Africa would see, and in the moment the Black South African community was horrified. In response, the following week was full of demonstrations, protests and marches. Because of this, the South African government saw fit to declare a state of emergency, and arrested thousands of people who had been protesting. Numbers approached 10,000 people by May, and many of these people were not released for months afterwards. Also in the fallout of the Sharpeville massacre, the South African government banned any organisations that were considered a threat to public safety or public order. This included organisations such as the ANC and the PAC (another organisation that was committed to activism for Black South Africans through peaceful protesting).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blackpast.org/global-african-history/sharpeville-massacre/|title=Sharpeville Massacre \u2022 BlackPast|date=2009-02-22|website=BlackPast|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref>\u00a0\n\nUnder apartheid, Black women were affected to an extreme degree due to discriminatory racial and gender laws. There were not many opportunities for women to become \u00a0political leaders, as many organisations allowed male membership only, so not many women did get very involved with politics. There were several organizations that let women join, or had entirely separate organizations there for women to join, one such being the ANCWL or ANC Women\u2019s League. In a protest of the ''[[Natives (Abolition of Passes and Co-ordination of Documents) Act|Natives (Abolition of Passes and Coordination of Documents) Act of 1952]]'' as mentioned above and several other pieces of legislation, many women participated in movements against the government for the first time in the form of the Defiance campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/women-and-struggle-against-apartheid|title=Women and the struggle against Apartheid &#124; South African History Online|website=www.sahistory.org.za}}</ref> The defiance campaign was a movement organized in part by the ANC because of new apartheid legislation from the government. Women were not the only people to take part in this campaign, but the inclusion of women is noteworthy because this was the first campaign to see major participation from women. The movement itself involved thousands of Black citizens doing nonviolent things that would normally be considered as civil disobedience, such as going into areas that only White people were allowed into, or burning their pass books. The idea behind the movement, was that if enough Black people flooded the South African prison and judicial system, then it would force the government to reform the apartheid laws. Thousands of people were arrested in a matter of months, but the campaign did not accomplish its goal of forcing radical change. However, it did capture the attention of the global community, and that of the United Nations. In time the UN would launch an investigation into the apartheid policy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/defiance-campaign-1952|title=Defiance Campaign 1952|last=Anonymous|date=2011-03-21|website=South African History Online|language=en|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980's, resistance to apartheid became extreme. The [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]] was formed in order to try and unite people all over to join in the fight against government oppression. The leader of the front, [[Allan Boesak]], called for organizations all over South Africa to help him. This included churches, civic associations, trade unions, student organizations, and sports bodies. The UDF became extremely popular among the Black community, and helped unite everyone who was fighting for equality, something that had not happened in the past. The government\u2019s response was to declare another national emergency, and again South Africa saw thousands of arrests and hundreds of killing. However by 1990, the burden of so much public violence was too much. The government was losing its tight grip on the country, and eventually the state president, [[F. W. de Klerk|F.W. de Klerk]], decided that reform was absolutely necessary. This led to the end of apartheid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/organisations/united-democratic-front-udf|title=United Democratic Front (UDF)|last=tinashe|date=2011-03-30|website=South African History Online|language=en|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref>\n\n== Post-Apartheid racism ==\n\n=== Racism and related violence against black people ===\n\nAlthough Apartheid was abolished in South Africa, and overt racism against black people is on the decline, [[institutional racism]] is still common in South Africa.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2018-01-26-00-institutional-racism-is-still-alive-and-kicking-in-the-workplace|title=Institutional racism is still alive and kicking in the workplaces|work=mg|access-date=2019-04-18|language=en}}</ref>\n\nPenny Sparrow, a 70-year-old real estate agent suffering of blindness who lives in the coastal city of Durban compared African people as a whole to dirty monkeys that litter on the previously white only beaches  and was apologetic for her remarks, defending them as being taken out of context.

This scarcity of quality educational institutions forced local youth to travel to faraway regions of the country ([[British Raj|British India]]) in pursuit of higher education. This same lack of educational opportunities in the region motivated Nawab Sir Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum and Sir George Roos-Keppel to establish an institution that would not only cater the academic needs of the region but also produce leaders from the region.\n\n== History ==\nBy 1909, as the idea of a college in the province was taking shape in the minds of both Nawab Sir [[Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum]] and [[Sir George Roos-Keppel]], it was further strengthened by their visit to the [[Aligarh Muslim University]] the same year. Nawab Sahib asked the students, especially those from the N.W.F.P. who were studying there as to what were the problems they were facing there and how he could help them. The students told him that they needed a hostel. Nawab Sahib informed them that rather than building them a hostel at Aligarh, he would build them a college at Peshawar.\n\nConsequently, on April 12, 1911, Nawab Sahib arranged a meeting of like minded people in [[Peshawar]] at the residence of Abdul Karim, contractor at [[Peshawar]] city, which was attended by Arbab Ghulam Haider Khan Khalil of Tehkal, Habibullah Khan, Khushal Khan, Sethi Karim Bakhsh, Sir [[Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum]], Khan Sahib [[Abdul Majid Khan Tarin|Abdul Majid Khan]] and others. Sir [[Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum]] moved the motion for collection of contributions, which was instantly responded to by cash donations by all present.Mian Rahim Shah Kaka Khel donated cash at the meeting and promised to make a hostel for the students apart from the donation, which he did and still it stands in the campus as 'Rahim Shah Ward' \nIn addition to his instant cash donation, the Nawab of [[Dir (Pakistan)|Dir]] promised further cash 5 lakh ropees and 5&nbsp;kg gold besides four hundred trees. The Nawab of [[Amb (princely state)|Amb]], Nawab [[Muhammad Khan Zaman Khan|Khan i Zaman Khan]] also made a cash contribution of Rs. 100,000 on the request of Syed Abdul Jabbar Shah to the cause{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}. Subscriptions were also given by the [[Afridi (Pashtun)|Afridi]] Chiefs and leading religious elders. An example was set by Bibigul, widow of Khairullah Khan of Prang, who gave her ornaments on Jun 6, 1911 as her subscription towards the college fund.\n[[File:Islamia College Peshawar (Historic Painting by Marguerite Tipping 1914, wife of 1st Principal Llewellyn Tipping).jpg|thumb|346x346px|Historic Painting by Marguerite Tipping 1914, wife of 1st Principal Llewellyn Tipping]]\nSubsequently, a large plot of land was purchased for the college building from the Khalil (Arbabs) of Tehkal Rs. 1,50,000/- from Nizam of Hyderabad was sent by Syed Abdul Jabbar Shah to Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum as donation for the college. Other chiefs and nobles of the North-West Frontier and Punjab, also made various donations.\n[[File:Islamia College Peshawar (Public Sector University), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan cropped.jpg|thumb|268x268px|Islamia College Peshawar side view]]\n[[File:Islamia College Peshawar 2.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the college's grounds.]][[Turangzai|Haji Sahib of Turangzai]], the most famous Pukhtun religious leader of the time was requested by Nawab Sir [[Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum]] to lay the foundation stone of Islamia College. Haji Sahib agreed to the request, however, he had been declared a proclaimed offender by the British for his anti-British activities and his entry was banned into British controlled territory. He was residing in tribal territory, which was outside British control, so Nawab Sahib prevailed upon Sir [[George Roos-Keppel]] and the British to permit Haji Sahib to enter British controlled territory for one day so he could lay the foundation stone of Islamia College. The British agreed to this request with the understanding that Haji Sahib would return to tribal territory once he had laid the foundation stone. Haji Sahib was permitted to enter British controlled territory for the ceremony and spent the night in the 'Pokh' [[Mosque]] of Tehkal. At the foundation stone laying ceremony, Sir [[George Roos-Keppel|Roos Keppel]] and other British officials were present, so Haji Sahib hid his face in his sheet (Chadar) from them and was led by Sheikh Muhammad Ibrahim to the place where he was to lay the foundation stone.
