The place later became the focus of the [[Otago Association]], an offshoot of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843\u20131900)|Free Church of Scotland]], notable for its adoption of the principle that ordinary people, not the landowner, should choose the ministers.\n\nMajor centres include Dunedin (the principal city), [[Oamaru]] (made famous by [[Janet Frame]]), [[Balclutha, New Zealand|Balclutha]], [[Alexandra, New Zealand|Alexandra]], and the major tourist centres [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]] and [[Wanaka]]. [[Kaitangata, New Zealand|Kaitangata]] in [[South Otago]] is a prominent source of [[coal]]. The [[Waitaki River|Waitaki]] and [[Clutha River|Clutha]] rivers provide much of the country's [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power. [[Vineyard]]s and wineries have been developed in the [[Central Otago wine region]]. Some parts of the area originally covered by [[Otago Province]] are now administered by either [[Canterbury Regional Council]] or [[Southland Regional Council]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Otago}}\n\nThe Otago settlement, an outgrowth of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]], materialised in March 1848 with the arrival of the first two immigrant ships from [[Greenock]] on the [[Firth of Clyde]]\u2014the ''[[John Wickliffe (ship)|John Wickliffe]]'' and the ''Philip Laing''. Captain [[William Cargill]], a veteran of the [[Peninsular War]], was the secular leader: Otago citizens subsequently elected him to the office of provincial Superintendent after the [[Provinces of New Zealand|New Zealand provinces]] were created in 1853.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last1=McKinnon |first1=Malcolm |title=Otago region \u2013 The Otago settlement |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/otago-region/page-5 |encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |accessdate=16 April 2020 |language=en-NZ |date=1 May 2015}}</ref> The [[Otago Province]] was the whole of New Zealand from the [[Waitaki River]] south, including Stewart Island and the sub-Antarctic islands. It included the territory of the later [[Southland Province]] and also the much more extensive lands of the modern [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland Region]].\n\n[[File:Arrowtown (4678481119).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Arrowtown]], a historic mining town]]\nInitial settlement was concentrated on the port and city, then expanded, notably to the south-west, where the fertile [[Taieri Plains]] offered good farmland.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last1=McKinnon |first1=Malcolm |title=Otago region \u2013 Wool and farming |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/otago-region/page-6 |encyclopedia=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=16 April 2020 |language=en-NZ |date=1 May 2015}}</ref> The 1860s saw rapid commercial expansion after [[Gabriel Read]] discovered gold at [[Gabriel's Gully]] near [[Lawrence, New Zealand|Lawrence]], and the [[Central Otago goldrush]] ensued.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last1=McKinnon |first1=Malcolm |title=Otago region \u2013 Gold and development |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/otago-region/page-7 |encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |accessdate=16 April 2020 |language=en-NZ |date=1 May 2015}}</ref> Veterans of goldfields in California and Australia, plus many other fortune-seekers from Europe, North America and China, poured into the then Province of Otago, eroding its Scottish [[Presbyterian]] character. Further gold discoveries at [[Clyde, New Zealand|Clyde]] and on the Arrow River around [[Arrowtown]] led to a boom, and Otago became for a period the cultural and economic centre of New Zealand. New Zealand's first daily newspaper, the ''[[Otago Daily Times]]'', originally edited by [[Julius Vogel]], dates from this period.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last1=McKinnon |first1=Malcolm |title=Otago region \u2013 Art, writing and music |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/otago-region/page-14 |encyclopedia=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=16 April 2020 |language=en-NZ |date=1 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:University of Otago.jpg|thumb|The [[University of Otago]], New Zealand's oldest university]]\nNew Zealand's first university, the [[University of Otago]], was founded in 1869 as the provincial university in Dunedin.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of the University of Otago |url=https://www.otago.ac.nz/about/history/index.html |website=www.otago.ac.nz |publisher=University of Otago |accessdate=16 April 2020 |language=en-nz}}</ref>\n\nThe Province of Southland separated from Otago Province and set up its own Provincial Council at [[Invercargill]] in 1861. After difficulties ensued, Otago re-absorbed it in 1870. Its territory is included in the southern region of the old Otago Province which is named after it and is now the territory of the Southland region.\n\nThe provincial governments were abolished in 1876 when the Abolition of the Provinces Act came into force on 1 November 1876,<ref>[http://rulers.org/newzprov.html New Zealand Provinces 1848\u201377]</ref> and were replaced by other forms of local authority, including counties. Two in Otago were named after the Scottish independence heroes [[William Wallace|Wallace]] and [[Robert I of Scotland|Bruce]]. From this time the national limelight gradually shifted northwards.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Beaumont, New Zealand aerial photo 2006.jpg|thumb|Aerial photo of [[Beaumont, New Zealand|Beaumont]] area in Otago, looking southwest.

The highest peak in Otago (and highest outside the [[Aoraki/Mount Cook]] area) is [[Mount Aspiring / Tititea]],<ref name=\"landscape\">{{cite encyclopedia |last1=McKinnon |first1=Malcolm |title=Otago region \u2013 Geology and landscape |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/otago-region/page-2 |encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |accessdate=16 April 2020 |language=en-NZ |date=1 May 2015}}</ref> which is on the [[Main Divide]]. From the high mountains the rivers discharge into large glacial lakes. In this part of Otago [[glacial]] activity \u2013 both recent and very old \u2013 dominates the landscape, with large 'U' shaped valleys and rivers which have high sediment loads. River flows also vary dramatically, with large flood flows occurring after heavy rain. Lakes [[Lake Wakatipu|Wakatipu]], [[Lake Wanaka|Wanaka]], and [[Lake Hawea|Hawea]] form the sources of the Clutha, the largest river (by discharge) in New Zealand. The Clutha flows generally to the southeast through Otago and discharges near [[Balclutha, New Zealand|Balclutha]]. The river has been used for [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] generation, with large dams at [[Clyde, New Zealand|Clyde]] and [[Roxburgh, New Zealand|Roxburgh]]. The traditional northern boundary of the region, the [[Waitaki River]], is also heavily utilised for hydroelectricity, though the region's current official boundaries put much of that river's catchment in [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]].\n\n[[File:Kawarau Gorge and Roaring Meg.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kawarau Gorge]], where [[Roaring Meg hydro scheme|Roaring Meg]] joins the [[Kawarau River]], in central Otago]]\nThe country's fourth-longest river, the [[Taieri River|Taieri]], also has both its source and outflow in Otago, rising from rough hill country and following a broad horseshoe-shaped path, north, then east, and finally southeast, before reaching the Pacific Ocean. Along its course it forms two notable geographic features \u2013 the broad high valley of the [[Strath-Taieri]] in its upper reaches, and the fertile [[Taieri Plains]] as it approaches the ocean.\n\nTravelling east from the mountains, the [[Central Otago]] drylands predominate. These are [[Canterbury-Otago tussock grasslands]] dominated by the block mountains, upthrust [[schist]] mountains. In contrast to Canterbury, where the Northwest winds blow across the plains without interruption, in Otago the block mountains impede and dilute the effects of the [[Nor'west arch|Nor'wester]].\n\nThe main Central Otago centres, such as [[Alexandra, New Zealand|Alexandra]] and [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]], are found in the intermontane basins between the block mountains. The schist bedrock influence extends to the eastern part of Otago, where remnant volcanics mark its edge. The remains of the most spectacular of these are the Miocene volcanics centred on [[Otago Harbour]]. Elsewhere, basalt outcrops can be found along the coast and at other sites.\n\nComparatively similar terrain exists in the high plateau land of the [[Maniototo Plain]], which lies to the east of Central Otago, close to the upper reaches of the Taieri River. This area is sparsely populated, but of historical note for its importance during the [[Central Otago Gold Rush]] of the 1860s. The townships of [[Ranfurly, New Zealand|Ranfurly]] and [[Naseby, New Zealand|Naseby]] lie in this area.\n\nIn the southeastern corner of Otago lies [[The Catlins]],<ref name=\"landscape\"/> an area of rough hill country which geologically forms part of the Murihiku [[terrane]], an accretion which extends inland through the [[Hokonui Hills]] in the [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]] region. This itself forms part of a larger system known as the Southland [[Syncline]], which links to similar formations in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] (offset by the [[Alpine Fault]]) and even in [[New Caledonia]], {{convert|3500|km|mi|abbr=on}} away.<ref name=\"Heads1989\">Heads, Michael (1989).

Fossils of the late and middle Triassic [[New Zealand geologic time scale|Warepan and Kaihikuan]] stages are found in the area.\n\n==Climate==\nWeather conditions vary enormously across Otago, but can be broken into two broad types: the coastal climate of the coastal regions and the more continental climate of the interior.<ref name=\"climate\">{{cite encyclopedia |last1=McKinnon |first1=Malcolm |title=Otago region \u2013 Climate, plants and animals |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/otago-region/page-3 |encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |accessdate=16 April 2020 |language=en-NZ |date=1 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nCoastal regions of Otago are subject to the alternating warm and dry/cool and wet weather patterns common to the interannual [[Southern oscillation]]. The Southern Hemisphere storm track produces an irregular short cycle of weather which repeats roughly every week, with three or four days of fine weather followed by three or four days of cooler, damp conditions. Drier conditions are often the result of the [[Nor'west arch|northwesterly]] [[f\u00f6hn]] wind, which dries as it crosses the [[Southern Alps]]. Wetter air is the result of approaching low-pressure systems which sweep fronts over the country from the southwest. A common variant in this pattern is the centring of a stationary low-pressure zone to the southeast of the country, resulting in long-lasting cool, wet conditions. These have been responsible for several notable historical floods, such as the \"hundred year floods\" of October 1878 and October 1978.\n\nTypically, winters are cool and wet in the extreme south areas and snow can fall and settle to sea level in winter, especially in the hills and plains of [[South Otago]]. More Central and Northern Coastal areas winter is sunnier and drier. Summers, by contrast, tend to be warm and dry, with temperatures often reaching the high 20s and low 30s Celsius.\n\nIn [[Central Otago]] cold frosty winters are succeeded by hot dry summers. Central Otago's climate is the closest approximation to a continental climate anywhere in New Zealand. This climate is part of the reason why [[Central Otago wines|Central Otago vineyards]] are successful in this region. This inland region is one of the driest regions in the country, sheltered from prevailing rain-bearing weather conditions by the high mountains to the west and hills of the south. Summers can be hot, with temperatures often approaching or exceeding 30 degrees Celsius; winters, by contrast, are often bitterly cold \u2013 the township of [[Ranfurly, New Zealand|Ranfurly]] in Central Otago holds the New Zealand record for lowest temperature with a reading of \u221225.6&nbsp;\u00b0C on 18 July 1903.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Brenstrum |first1=Erick |title=Broken record |url=https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/broken-record/ |accessdate=16 April 2020 |work=[[New Zealand Geographic]] |issue=137 |date=2016 |language=en-NZ}}</ref>\n\n==Population==\n[[File:OtagoRegionPopulationDensity.png|thumb|right| A map showing population density in the Otago Region at the 2006 census.]]\nThe population of Otago is {{NZ population data 2018|Otago region|y|}},<ref name=\"NZ_population_data_2018\" /> which is approximately {{Rnd|{{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Otago region|y}}|R}}/{{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|New Zealand|y}}|R}}*100|1}} percent of New Zealand's total population of {{Rnd|{{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|New Zealand|y}}|R}}/1000000|1}} million.

Its population was {{NZ population data 2018|Otago region|y|y|y| in |.}}\n\nThe name \"Otago\" is an [[Anglicisation]] of \"[[Otakou]]\", the name of the M\u0101ori village near the entrance to the harbour.<ref>Peter Entwisle, ''Behold the Moon: The European Occupation of the Dunedin District 1770\u20131848'', Dunedin, NZ: Port Daniel Press, 1998 ({{ISBN|0-473-05591-0}}), appendix 1 pp.136\u2013139.</ref> The exact meaning of the term is disputed, with common translations being \"isolated village\" and \"place of red earth\", the latter referring to the reddish-ochre clay which is common in the area around [[Dunedin]]. \"Otago\" is also the old name of the European settlement on the [[Otago Harbour]], established by the [[Weller Brothers]] in 1831, which lies close to the modern harbourside community of Otakou. The place later became the focus of the [[Otago Association]], an offshoot of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843\u20131900)|Free Church of Scotland]], notable for its adoption of the principle that ordinary people, not the landowner, should choose the ministers.\n\nMajor centres include Dunedin (the principal city), [[Oamaru]] (made famous by [[Janet Frame]]), [[Balclutha, New Zealand|Balclutha]], [[Alexandra, New Zealand|Alexandra]], and the major tourist centres [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]] and [[Wanaka]]. [[Kaitangata, New Zealand|Kaitangata]] in [[South Otago]] is a prominent source of [[coal]]. The [[Waitaki River|Waitaki]] and [[Clutha River|Clutha]] rivers provide much of the country's [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power. [[Vineyard]]s and wineries have been developed in the [[Central Otago wine region]]. Some parts of the area originally covered by [[Otago Province]] are now administered by either [[Canterbury Regional Council]] or [[Southland Regional Council]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Otago}}\n\nThe Otago settlement, an outgrowth of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]], materialised in March 1848 with the arrival of the first two immigrant ships from [[Greenock]] on the [[Firth of Clyde]]\u2014the ''[[John Wickliffe (ship)|John Wickliffe]]'' and the ''Philip Laing''. Captain [[William Cargill]], a veteran of the [[Peninsular War]], was the secular leader: Otago citizens subsequently elected him to the office of provincial Superintendent after the [[Provinces of New Zealand|New Zealand provinces]] were created in 1853.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last1=McKinnon |first1=Malcolm |title=Otago region \u2013 The Otago settlement |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/otago-region/page-5 |encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |accessdate=16 April 2020 |language=en-NZ |date=1 May 2015}}</ref> The [[Otago Province]] was the whole of New Zealand from the [[Waitaki River]] south, including Stewart Island and the sub-Antarctic islands. It included the territory of the later [[Southland Province]] and also the much more extensive lands of the modern [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland Region]].\n\n[[File:Arrowtown (4678481119).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Arrowtown]], a historic mining town]]\nInitial settlement was concentrated on the port and city, then expanded, notably to the south-west, where the fertile [[Taieri Plains]] offered good farmland.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last1=McKinnon |first1=Malcolm |title=Otago region \u2013 Wool and farming |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/otago-region/page-6 |encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |accessdate=16 April 2020 |language=en-NZ |date=1 May 2015}}</ref> The 1860s saw rapid commercial expansion after [[Gabriel Read]] discovered gold at [[Gabriel's Gully]] near [[Lawrence, New Zealand|Lawrence]], and the [[Central Otago goldrush]] ensued.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last1=McKinnon |first1=Malcolm |title=Otago region \u2013 Gold and development |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/otago-region/page-7 |encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |accessdate=16 April 2020 |language=en-NZ |date=1 May 2015}}</ref> Veterans of goldfields in California and Australia, plus many other fortune-seekers from Europe, North America and China, poured into the then Province of Otago, eroding its Scottish [[Presbyterian]] character. Further gold discoveries at [[Clyde, New Zealand|Clyde]] and on the Arrow River around [[Arrowtown]] led to a boom, and Otago became for a period the cultural and economic centre of New Zealand. New Zealand's first daily newspaper, the ''[[Otago Daily Times]]'', originally edited by [[Julius Vogel]], dates from this period.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last1=McKinnon |first1=Malcolm |title=Otago region \u2013 Art, writing and music |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/otago-region/page-14 |encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |accessdate=16 April 2020 |language=en-NZ |date=1 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:University of Otago.jpg|thumb|The [[University of Otago]], New Zealand's oldest university]]\nNew Zealand's first university, the [[University of Otago]], was founded in 1869 as the provincial university in Dunedin.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of the University of Otago |url=https://www.otago.ac.nz/about/history/index.html |website=www.otago.ac.nz |publisher=University of Otago |accessdate=16 April 2020 |language=en-nz}}</ref>\n\nThe Province of Southland separated from Otago Province and set up its own Provincial Council at [[Invercargill]] in 1861. After difficulties ensued, Otago re-absorbed it in 1870. Its territory is included in the southern region of the old Otago Province which is named after it and is now the territory of the Southland region.\n\nThe provincial governments were abolished in 1876 when the Abolition of the Provinces Act came into force on 1 November 1876,<ref>[http://rulers.org/newzprov.html New Zealand Provinces 1848\u201377]</ref> and were replaced by other forms of local authority, including counties. Two in Otago were named after the Scottish independence heroes [[William Wallace|Wallace]] and [[Robert I of Scotland|Bruce]]. From this time the national limelight gradually shifted northwards.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Beaumont, New Zealand aerial photo 2006.jpg|thumb|Aerial photo of [[Beaumont, New Zealand|Beaumont]] area in Otago, looking southwest. [[New Zealand State Highway 8|State Highway 8]] runs from left to right across the photo (only visible in the right half), and crosses the [[Clutha River]] just below centre.]]\n[[File:Mount Aspiring, Otago, New Zealand, 22 July 2005.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Aspiring / Tititea]] is New Zealand's highest mountain outside the [[Aoraki / Mount Cook]] region.]]\nBeginning in the west, the geography of Otago consists of high alpine mountains. The highest peak in Otago (and highest outside the [[Aoraki/Mount Cook]] area) is [[Mount Aspiring / Tititea]],<ref name=\"landscape\">{{cite encyclopedia |last1=McKinnon |first1=Malcolm |title=Otago region \u2013 Geology and landscape |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/otago-region/page-2 |encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |accessdate=16 April 2020 |language=en-NZ |date=1 May 2015}}</ref> which is on the [[Main Divide]]. From the high mountains the rivers discharge into large glacial lakes. In this part of Otago [[glacial]] activity \u2013 both recent and very old \u2013 dominates the landscape, with large 'U' shaped valleys and rivers which have high sediment loads. River flows also vary dramatically, with large flood flows occurring after heavy rain. Lakes [[Lake Wakatipu|Wakatipu]], [[Lake Wanaka|Wanaka]], and [[Lake Hawea|Hawea]] form the sources of the Clutha, the largest river (by discharge) in New Zealand. The Clutha flows generally to the southeast through Otago and discharges near [[Balclutha, New Zealand|Balclutha]]. The river has been used for [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] generation, with large dams at [[Clyde, New Zealand|Clyde]] and [[Roxburgh, New Zealand|Roxburgh]]. The traditional northern boundary of the region, the [[Waitaki River]], is also heavily utilised for hydroelectricity, though the region's current official boundaries put much of that river's catchment in [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]].\n\n[[File:Kawarau Gorge and Roaring Meg.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kawarau Gorge]], where [[Roaring Meg hydro scheme|Roaring Meg]] joins the [[Kawarau River]], in central Otago]]\nThe country's fourth-longest river, the [[Taieri River|Taieri]], also has both its source and outflow in Otago, rising from rough hill country and following a broad horseshoe-shaped path, north, then east, and finally southeast, before reaching the Pacific Ocean. Along its course it forms two notable geographic features \u2013 the broad high valley of the [[Strath-Taieri]] in its upper reaches, and the fertile [[Taieri Plains]] as it approaches the ocean.\n\nTravelling east from the mountains, the [[Central Otago]] drylands predominate. These are [[Canterbury-Otago tussock grasslands]] dominated by the block mountains, upthrust [[schist]] mountains. In contrast to Canterbury, where the Northwest winds blow across the plains without interruption, in Otago the block mountains impede and dilute the effects of the [[Nor'west arch|Nor'wester]].\n\nThe main Central Otago centres, such as [[Alexandra, New Zealand|Alexandra]] and [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]], are found in the intermontane basins between the block mountains. The schist bedrock influence extends to the eastern part of Otago, where remnant volcanics mark its edge. The remains of the most spectacular of these are the Miocene volcanics centred on [[Otago Harbour]]. Elsewhere, basalt outcrops can be found along the coast and at other sites.\n\nComparatively similar terrain exists in the high plateau land of the [[Maniototo Plain]], which lies to the east of Central Otago, close to the upper reaches of the Taieri River. This area is sparsely populated, but of historical note for its importance during the [[Central Otago Gold Rush]] of the 1860s. The townships of [[Ranfurly, New Zealand|Ranfurly]] and [[Naseby, New Zealand|Naseby]] lie in this area.\n\nIn the southeastern corner of Otago lies [[The Catlins]],<ref name=\"landscape\"/> an area of rough hill country which geologically forms part of the Murihiku [[terrane]], an accretion which extends inland through the [[Hokonui Hills]] in the [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]] region. This itself forms part of a larger system known as the Southland [[Syncline]], which links to similar formations in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] (offset by the [[Alpine Fault]]) and even in [[New Caledonia]], {{convert|3500|km|mi|abbr=on}} away.<ref name=\"Heads1989\">Heads, Michael (1989).

Fossils of the late and middle Triassic [[New Zealand geologic time scale|Warepan and Kaihikuan]] stages are found in the area.\n\n==Climate==\nWeather conditions vary enormously across Otago, but can be broken into two broad types: the coastal climate of the coastal regions and the more continental climate of the interior.<ref name=\"climate\">{{cite encyclopedia |last1=McKinnon |first1=Malcolm |title=Otago region \u2013 Climate, plants and animals |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/otago-region/page-3 |encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |accessdate=16 April 2020 |language=en-NZ |date=1 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nCoastal regions of Otago are subject to the alternating warm and dry/cool and wet weather patterns common to the interannual [[Southern oscillation]]. The Southern Hemisphere storm track produces an irregular short cycle of weather which repeats roughly every week, with three or four days of fine weather followed by three or four days of cooler, damp conditions. Drier conditions are often the result of the [[Nor'west arch|northwesterly]] [[f\u00f6hn]] wind, which dries as it crosses the [[Southern Alps]]. Wetter air is the result of approaching low-pressure systems which sweep fronts over the country from the southwest. A common variant in this pattern is the centring of a stationary low-pressure zone to the southeast of the country, resulting in long-lasting cool, wet conditions. These have been responsible for several notable historical floods, such as the \"hundred year floods\" of October 1878 and October 1978.\n\nTypically, winters are cool and wet in the extreme south areas and snow can fall and settle to sea level in winter, especially in the hills and plains of [[South Otago]]. More Central and Northern Coastal areas winter is sunnier and drier. Summers, by contrast, tend to be warm and dry, with temperatures often reaching the high 20s and low 30s Celsius.\n\nIn [[Central Otago]] cold frosty winters are succeeded by hot dry summers. Central Otago's climate is the closest approximation to a continental climate anywhere in New Zealand. This climate is part of the reason why [[Central Otago wines|Central Otago vineyards]] are successful in this region. This inland region is one of the driest regions in the country, sheltered from prevailing rain-bearing weather conditions by the high mountains to the west and hills of the south. Summers can be hot, with temperatures often approaching or exceeding 30 degrees Celsius; winters, by contrast, are often bitterly cold \u2013 the township of [[Ranfurly, New Zealand|Ranfurly]] in Central Otago holds the New Zealand record for lowest temperature with a reading of \u221225.6&nbsp;\u00b0C on 18 July 1903.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Brenstrum |first1=Erick |title=Broken record |url=https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/broken-record/ |accessdate=16 April 2020 |work=[[New Zealand Geographic]] |issue=137 |date=2016 |language=en-NZ}}</ref>\n\n==Population==\n[[File:OtagoRegionPopulationDensity.png|thumb|right| A map showing population density in the Otago Region at the 2006 census.]]\nThe population of Otago is {{NZ population data 2018|Otago region|y|}},<ref name=\"NZ_population_data_2018\" /> which is approximately {{Rnd|{{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Otago region|y}}|R}}/{{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|New Zealand|y}}|R}}*100|1}} percent of New Zealand's total population of {{Rnd|{{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|New Zealand|y}}|R}}/1000000|1}} million.

For historical and geographical reasons, Dunedin is usually regarded as one of New Zealand's four main centres. Unlike other southern centres, Dunedin's population has not declined since the 1970s, largely due to the presence of the [[University of Otago]] \u2013 and especially its [[University of Otago Dunedin School of Medicine|medical school]] \u2013 which attracts students from all over New Zealand and overseas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/otago-region/11|title=Otago region: Population and employment since 1920|last=Mckinnon|first=Malcolm|date=17 August 2009|work=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=2010-02-18}}</ref>\n\nOther significant urban centres in Otago with populations over 1,000 include: [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]], [[Oamaru]], [[Wanaka]], [[Port Chalmers]], [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]], [[Alexandra, New Zealand|Alexandra]], [[Balclutha, New Zealand|Balclutha]], [[Milton, New Zealand|Milton]] and [[Mosgiel]].

The Council is chaired by Marian Hobbs of the Labour Party as of 2019.\n\nThere are five [[territorial authorities of New Zealand|territorial authorities]] in Otago:\n* [[Queenstown-Lakes District]]\n* [[Central Otago District]]\n* [[Dunedin|Dunedin City]]\n* [[Clutha District]]\n* [[Waitaki, New Zealand|Waitaki District]]\n\n===Parliamentary representation===\nOtago is represented by four [[New Zealand Parliament|parliamentary]] electorates. Dunedin and nearby towns are represented by the [[Dunedin North (New Zealand electorate)|Dunedin North]] electorate, held by [[David Clark (New Zealand politician)|David Clark]], and the [[Dunedin South]] electorate, occupied by [[Clare Curran]]. Both MPs are members of the governing [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]], and Dunedin has traditionally been a Labour stronghold. Since 2008 the rest of Otago has been divided between the large rural electorates of [[Waitaki (New Zealand electorate)|Waitaki]], which also includes some of the neighbouring [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] Region, and [[Clutha-Southland]], which also includes most of the rural part of the neighbouring Southland Region. The Waitaki electorate has traditionally been a [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] stronghold and is currently held by [[Jacqui Dean]]. The Clutha-Southland electorate, also a National Party stronghold, is currently represented by [[Hamish Walker]]. The earlier [[Otago (New Zealand electorate)|Otago electorate]] existed from 1978 to 2008, when it was split and merged into Waitaki and Clutha-Southland.\n\nOne [[Party-list proportional representation|list MP]] is based in Dunedin \u2013 [[Michael Woodhouse]] of the National Party. One-time Labour Party Deputy Leader [[David Parker (New Zealand politician)|David Parker]] is a former MP for the Otago electorate and currently a list MP.\n\nUnder the [[M\u0101ori seats]] system, Otago is also part of the large [[Te Tai Tonga (New Zealand electorate)|Te Tai Tonga]] electorate, which covers the entire South Island and surrounding islands, and is currently held by Labour Party MP [[Rino Tirikatene]].\n\n=== Ng\u0101i Tahu governance ===\nThree of the 18 [[Ng\u0101i Tahu]] [[R\u016bnanga]] (councils) are based in the Otago Region. All of which are centred at coastal marae, [[Otakou|\u014ct\u0101kou]], [[Moeraki]] and Puketeraki at [[Karitane]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ngaitahu.iwi.nz/te-runanga-o-ngai-tahu/papatipu-runanga/|title=Papatipu R\u016bnanga|website=Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu|language=en-NZ|access-date=2019-01-30}}</ref> There is also the Arai Te Uru Marae in Dunedin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.araiteuru.co.nz/|title=Arai Te Uru Whare Hauora|website=Arai Te Uru Whare Hauora|language=en-NZ|access-date=2019-01-30}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nOtago has a mixed economy. Dunedin is home to manufacturing, publishing and technology-based industries. Rural economies have been reinvigorated in the 1990s and 2000s: in Clutha district, farms have been converted from sheep to more lucrative dairying. Vineyard planting and production remained modest until the middle of the 1990s when the [[New Zealand wine]] industry began to expand rapidly.  The [[Central Otago wine region]] produces award-winning wines made from varieties such as the [[Pinot noir]], [[Chardonnay]], [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[Merlot]] and [[Riesling]] grapes.

The region of North Karnataka was more under so-called Elephant, Lion, Horse and Bull Maharatis.  Again, later Shatavahana branch and Later Kuras moved southward to establish only in Banavasi. The region of Dakshina Kannada (modern Udupi and Mangalore district) was free from any such an external influence and appears to have been under the strict control of Alupa kings in the ancient times.\n\nThe rule over Uttara Kannada region, with Banavasi as its capital was by [[Chutu]] clan followed by the [[Shatavahana]] branch which governed for Siri, Siva, Pulumavi and Yajna Satakarnis, prior to the Kadambas. With the Kadambas rule from Banavasi, Karnataka saw developments in the field of art and culture. Land of Karnataka saw more and more epigraphs that recorded the activities of the past, mostly erected in the temple premises. The first clear mention of Alupas comes from the [[Halmidi]] inscription of 450 CE where their possible early ruler Pashupathi of Alapa (Alupa) gana is mentioned. Pashupathi was the contemporary of the Kadambas. Hence for historical record, we can safely assume that the dynastic formation of Alupas took place around 5th century CE. Their royal emblem was the double fish and they claimed to belong to the ''Pandyavamsha'' and ''Soma Kula'' (lunar).<ref name=\"kula\">Kamath (2001), p94</ref> Their coins carried the dynastic title \"Sri Pandya Dhananjaya\" which means \"Arjuna among the Pandyas\".\n\n==Land==\n[[File:Tulunadu.png|thumb| A Regional Map of Tulunadu in [[Karnataka]].Tulunadu also Includes [[Kasaragod district]] of [[Kerala]] state.|left]]\nAlthough Alupas controlled part of Uttara Kannada and Shimoga of Karnataka and northern part of Kerala during the zenith, the core region consisted of the modern Tulunadu which comprises Mangalore and Udupi district (earlier it used to be a single district ''Dakshina Kannada'', also known as South Canara.  In the ancient times, the region was referred as ''Alvakheda'' and during the later part of the reign, the region was referred as ''Tulunadu''. The term Tulunadu is still practised today while referring to the region.\n\n'''1. Alvakheda'''<br />\nThe term Alvakheda could be seen in several of ancient inscriptions of the Alupas. The region of Alvakheda encompassed the modern Tulunadu and part of Uttara Kannada up to Ankola on the coastal north and Banavasi on the interior west of Uttara Kannada District. Also, the region of Humcha in the Shimoga district, and the land of Kasaragod in Kerala up to the Payasvini river was the boundary in the south. The term Alvakheda is not seen in the inscriptions during the Vijayanagara period, when the region of Barakuru and Mangalore were two separate provinces under the administration of Governors who started controlling the territory without interfering in the autonomy of the Alupas.\n\n'''2. Tulunadu'''<br />\nThe region stretches from Mangalore in the south all the way to Baindoor in the north. On the west is the Arabian sea and on the east is the Western Ghat that fences the land like a fort that formed a heaven for the ruler. More than it, number of rivers that crisscrossed near Mangalore, Udyavara and Barkur made this land fertile. The western ghats, the thick forests and the towns along the shoreline of Arabian sea established several sea ports for trade with the Romans and Arabs.  Trade routes from with the Romans were well established as early as the 2nd century CE and with the Arabs around 7th century CE. The Netravati in Mangalore and Seethanadi in Barakur are the main rivers that run in the capital cities of Alupas.  Other rivers such as Suvarnanadi, Shambhavi in Karkala and Mulki, Gurupura river, Pavanje, Nandini and numerous streams all running from east to west.  The region of Puttur, Sullia, Belthangady and Puttur, Karkala are the Malnad region and supported as an agricultural backbone of the kingdom and the region of Mangalore, Udupi and Kundapur are the coastal regions that supported more of marine activities though agriculture is the other occupation.\n\nAn old Malayalam inscription ([[Ramanthali inscriptions]]), dated to 1075 CE, mentioning king Kunda Alupa, can be found at Ramanthali near [[Kannur|Cannanore]], Kerala. <ref>Narayanan, M. G. S. ''Perum\u0101\u1e37s of Kerala.'' Thrissur (Kerala): CosmoBooks, 2013. 483.</ref>\n\n==Political history==\nThe history of clan emerges from obscurity during the rise of [[Badami]] [[Chalukya]] in the Aihole and Mahakuta inscriptions which claims the Alupas had accepted Chalukya overlordship and become their feudatory.<ref name=\"kula\"/> They ruled initially from [[Mangalore]] and other times from Udyavara in [[Udupi]] and later [[Barkur]]. Their first regular full-length inscription is the ''Vaddarase'' inscription in Kannada is dated to early 7th century. They maintained marital relations with their overlords over the centuries.<ref name=\"oldest\">Kamath (2001), p97</ref>\n\nAlupas rule confined to the modern districts of Udupi, Mangalore and parts of Shimoga and Uttara Kannada districts in the state of Karanataka and part of northern Kerala (Kasaragod district) up to Payashvini river. In the history of India, no other single dynasty has ever ruled for over thousands years. The record that breaks this exception goes to the Alupas who ruled their territory for nearly thousand years.  Alupas though originated as a ruler to the coastal region of Karnataka around the beginning of the Christian era, it is only around the 5th century they made their debut as a dynasty as witnessed in the epigraph of Halmidi. The last ruler's name that we see in the epigraph of Venupura (Moodubidre), belong to the 14th century CE. There are over two hundred stone epigraphs left behind this dynasty and only about one hundred and twenty epigraphs have been read and deciphered so far. The finest record of the early Kannada script is seen in the 7th-century CE copper plate of Belmannu.  There is yet another set of five copper plates that surfaced in the beginning of 2007, but no information is known about the ruler, provenance within the district of Udupi or its content.\n\nAlupas put coins into circulation in 8th century CE and continued the tradition till 14th century CE. Their coins carried the dynastic emblem of \"Two fishes over a spread Lotus flower, below a royal umbrella\". Nearly 180 unique coins have been known so far, of which around 175 coins are published in the book written by Prabhu and Pai. The detailed history, with proper reference pointers is also seen in the same book.\n\n==Epigraphs==\n[[File:M Govinda Pai Regional Research Centre Udupi 001.jpg|thumb|right|upright|300px|The Vaddarse Old Kannada inscription (650 AD) of King Aluvarasa I]]\n\nThe earliest known [[Indian copper plate inscriptions|copper plate inscription]] in Kannada language is attributed to Aluvarasa II, called the Belamannu plates and is dated the early 8th century, according to Dr. Gururaj Bhat.<ref name=\"oldest\"/> This full-length Kannada copper plates in Old Kannada script (early 8th century CE) belongs to the Alupa King Aluvarasa II from Belmannu, Karkala Taluk, Udupi District, and displays the double crested fish, the royal emblem of Alupa kings.

The Panchalingeshwara temple at Barkur, Brahmalingeshwara temple at Brahamavar, Koteshwara temple at Kotinatha and the Sadashiva temple at Suratkal are attributed to them. They used sculptural styles from their various overlords over the centuries.<ref name=\"oldest\"/>\n\n1. '''Sri Rajarajeshwari Temple, Polali'''\n[[File:Polali Shri Rajarajeshwari.jpg|thumb| Clay [[Murti]] of the Goddess Rajarajeshwari at the temple patronized by the Alupas]]\nIn modern Mangalore District, [[Polali Rajarajeshwari Temple]] is one of the oldest temple that has the earliest inscription of the Alupa dynasty, written in 8th-century Kannada. The temple is dedicated to Sri Rajarashewari, and Alupa kings enriched this temple during throughout their rule.\n\n2. '''Sri Manjunatheshwara Temple, Kadri'''\n[[File:Kadri temple.JPG|thumb|The Kadri Manjunath temple was built and patronized by the Alupas]]\nIn modern Mangalore district, Kadri has the other important and old temple that belonged to the era of Alupas. The temple has several finest bronze statues installed by the King Kundavarma, which bears inscriptions of him dated 968 CE. In the inscription of Lokeshwara statue, king Kundavarma is compared to Arjuna in bravery.\n\n3. '''Sri Mahishamardini Temple, Neelavara'''<br />\nIn times, Alupas changed their capital from Mangalore to Udyavara, Udyavara to Mangalore and then again to Barkur depending on the political situation and demand. To be in centre to their ruling place, they even shifted their capital to Barakur from where they could look after the vast territory which spread up to Ankola in the North Kanara (Uttara Kannada District).  During this period, they patronised several temples in the surrounding areas of Barakuru (which was their captiral). Neelavara Kshetra is one such a holy place where Mahishasuramardini temple has several Alupa inscriptions of later period.\n\n4. '''Sri Panchalingeshwara Temple, Vittla'''<br />\nThis temple is one of the oldest temple of Alupa territory, built during 7th century CE. The architecture of the temple is in line with that of Sri Ananteshwara temple which is the oldest temple built by the Alupas. The architecture is unique and is an innovation of 7th century. The Havyakha Brahmins of Uttara Kannada were attracted during 7th century CE by the Alupas and were given Agraharas for imparting Vedic knowledge to the people of Alvakheda.  The Alupas built many temples and allowed these Brahmins to take care of it. The legend says that there were hundreds of temples that every day there is a festival in one or other temple of the region.  The temple of Vittla Panchalingeshwara is one of the oldest structure which was renovated by the later local dynasties such as Heggades.\n\n5. '''Sri Anantheshwara Temple, Udupi'''<br />\nDiagonally opposite to the main entrance of the Sri Krishna Mutt, and adjacent to the Chandramouleeshwara Temple, stands one of the oldest Alupa temple namely '''''[[Udupi Anantheshwara Temple|Sri Anantheswara Temple]]'''''.  An old belief is that lighting a lamp at the ancient Anantheshwara Temple takes away evil and sins. It is one of the biggest temple in Udupi. The main idol is Linga, whose adornment makes it to look like a Face of Lord Siva. From a small window on the left, the site where Madhvacharya disappeared is seen.\n\nBoth Sri Vittla Panchalingeshwara and Sri Udupi Anantheshwara Temple have Elephant-back type curvilinear structure. Another temple of similar architecture is also seen in Aihole Durga temple, appears to be a structure of 7th century CE. So, tagging it to any architectural style is ruled out unless more detailed study or research is done on this topic. The unique noteworthy feature of the architecture of South Canara temples is their roof.  Being in a landscape of high rainfall, the temple roofs evolved from grass, clay tiles and eventually with the copper-plates.\n\n==Coinage==\nThe Alupas as a feudatory of the [[Western Chalukyas]] in coastal Karnataka issued coins with [[Kannada]] and [[Devanagari|Nagari]] inscriptions on them. Coins with Kannada legends seem to have minted in Mangalore and those with Nagari legend at the Udupi mint. Kannada was their language of administration. The Pagodas and Fanams were the common coinage of all the Alupa kings.  The obverse of the coins carried the royal emblem \"Two Fishes\" and the reverse had the legend \"Sri Pandya Dhanamjaya\"  either in Nagari or old (Hale) Kannada.<ref name=\"oldest\"/>\n\nThis paragraph is about the inscription found at Neelavara temple of Udupi district. This is all about the grant in \"Gadyana\" denomination. The Alupas while ruling from Barakuru showed great interest in the development of temple. This record is of the Alupa ruler Veerapandyadeva, dated 1258 CE mentions about his instruction to \"neeruvara munnuru\" i.e. Neeruvara-300, the modern Neelavara village Assembly. It states that after paying 100 gadyanas (coins) to the palace and 30 gadyanas to Adhikari, remaining 30 gadyanas, should be used by the village assembly for its expense. Yet another inscription of Veerapandyadeva's queen Ballamahadevi, the next ruler is also seen here. The record mentions that when Ballamahadevi was ruling her kingdom with the help of samastapradanas, Deshi purushas, Bahattara niyogis and Rishi Purohita, she gave a grant to Niruvara Bhagavati, out of 100 honnus that is paid to the palace. This inscription was written by Keshava Senabhova as mentioned in the epigraph.\n\nThe Alupas were one of the three dynasties that issued gold coins as early as 8th century CE. The gold that used to mint coins came from trade with the Romans, Arabs and from the adjacent kingdom of Gangas. No other ancient dynasties of the south have issued that many varieties of gold coins as Alupas and Gangas did.  The coins of both Gangas and Alupas have inscriptions that helps in dating the period of issue. Unfortunately these coins have not drawn much attention compared to that of Chalukyas or Hoysals. But for sure, they have inspired later dynasties as a prototype or basis to issue coins.  Shown below is the hand-drawing of some of the Pandya Gadyanas (Alupa coins) obverse image.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Dr. Suryanath U.

The region of North Karnataka was more under so-called Elephant, Lion, Horse and Bull Maharatis.  Again, later Shatavahana branch and Later Kuras moved southward to establish only in Banavasi. The region of Dakshina Kannada (modern Udupi and Mangalore district) was free from any such an external influence and appears to have been under the strict control of Alupa kings in the ancient times.\n\nThe rule over Uttara Kannada region, with Banavasi as its capital was by [[Chutu]] clan followed by the [[Shatavahana]] branch which governed for Siri, Siva, Pulumavi and Yajna Satakarnis, prior to the Kadambas. With the Kadambas rule from Banavasi, Karnataka saw developments in the field of art and culture. Land of Karnataka saw more and more epigraphs that recorded the activities of the past, mostly erected in the temple premises. The first clear mention of Alupas comes from the [[Halmidi]] inscription of 450 CE where their possible early ruler Pashupathi of Alapa (Alupa) gana is mentioned. Pashupathi was the contemporary of the Kadambas. Hence for historical record, we can safely assume that the dynastic formation of Alupas took place around 5th century CE. Their royal emblem was the double fish and they claimed to belong to the ''Pandyavamsha'' and ''Soma Kula'' (lunar).<ref name=\"kula\">Kamath (2001), p94</ref> Their coins carried the dynastic title \"Sri Pandya Dhananjaya\" which means \"Arjuna among the Pandyas\".\n\n==Land==\n[[File:Tulunadu.png|thumb| A Regional Map of Tulunadu in [[Karnataka]].Tulunadu also Includes [[Kasaragod district]] of [[Kerala]] state.|left]]\nAlthough Alupas controlled part of Uttara Kannada and Shimoga of Karnataka and northern part of Kerala during the zenith, the core region consisted of the modern Tulunadu which comprises Mangalore and Udupi district (earlier it used to be a single district ''Dakshina Kannada'', also known as South Canara.  In the ancient times, the region was referred as ''Alvakheda'' and during the later part of the reign, the region was referred as ''Tulunadu''. The term Tulunadu is still practised today while referring to the region.\n\n'''1. Alvakheda'''<br />\nThe term Alvakheda could be seen in several of ancient inscriptions of the Alupas. The region of Alvakheda encompassed the modern Tulunadu and part of Uttara Kannada up to Ankola on the coastal north and Banavasi on the interior west of Uttara Kannada District. Also, the region of Humcha in the Shimoga district, and the land of Kasaragod in Kerala up to the Payasvini river was the boundary in the south. The term Alvakheda is not seen in the inscriptions during the Vijayanagara period, when the region of Barakuru and Mangalore were two separate provinces under the administration of Governors who started controlling the territory without interfering in the autonomy of the Alupas.\n\n'''2. Tulunadu'''<br />\nThe region stretches from Mangalore in the south all the way to Baindoor in the north. On the west is the Arabian sea and on the east is the Western Ghat that fences the land like a fort that formed a heaven for the ruler. More than it, number of rivers that crisscrossed near Mangalore, Udyavara and Barkur made this land fertile. The western ghats, the thick forests and the towns along the shoreline of Arabian sea established several sea ports for trade with the Romans and Arabs.  Trade routes from with the Romans were well established as early as the 2nd century CE and with the Arabs around 7th century CE. The Netravati in Mangalore and Seethanadi in Barakur are the main rivers that run in the capital cities of Alupas.  Other rivers such as Suvarnanadi, Shambhavi in Karkala and Mulki, Gurupura river, Pavanje, Nandini and numerous streams all running from east to west.  The region of Puttur, Sullia, Belthangady and Puttur, Karkala are the Malnad region and supported as an agricultural backbone of the kingdom and the region of Mangalore, Udupi and Kundapur are the coastal regions that supported more of marine activities though agriculture is the other occupation.\n\nAn old Malayalam inscription ([[Ramanthali inscriptions]]), dated to 1075 CE, mentioning king Kunda Alupa, can be found at Ramanthali near [[Kannur|Cannanore]], Kerala. <ref>Narayanan, M. G. S. ''Perum\u0101\u1e37s of Kerala.'' Thrissur (Kerala): CosmoBooks, 2013. 483.</ref>\n\n==Political history==\nThe history of clan emerges from obscurity during the rise of [[Badami]] [[Chalukya]] in the Aihole and Mahakuta inscriptions which claims the Alupas had accepted Chalukya overlordship and become their feudatory.<ref name=\"kula\"/> They ruled initially from [[Mangalore]] and other times from Udyavara in [[Udupi]] and later [[Barkur]]. Their first regular full-length inscription is the ''Vaddarase'' inscription in Kannada is dated to early 7th century. They maintained marital relations with their overlords over the centuries.<ref name=\"oldest\">Kamath (2001), p97</ref>\n\nAlupas rule confined to the modern districts of Udupi, Mangalore and parts of Shimoga and Uttara Kannada districts in the state of Karanataka and part of northern Kerala (Kasaragod district) up to Payashvini river. In the history of India, no other single dynasty has ever ruled for over thousands years. The record that breaks this exception goes to the Alupas who ruled their territory for nearly thousand years.  Alupas though originated as a ruler to the coastal region of Karnataka around the beginning of the Christian era, it is only around the 5th century they made their debut as a dynasty as witnessed in the epigraph of Halmidi. The last ruler's name that we see in the epigraph of Venupura (Moodubidre), belong to the 14th century CE. There are over two hundred stone epigraphs left behind this dynasty and only about one hundred and twenty epigraphs have been read and deciphered so far. The finest record of the early Kannada script is seen in the 7th-century CE copper plate of Belmannu.  There is yet another set of five copper plates that surfaced in the beginning of 2007, but no information is known about the ruler, provenance within the district of Udupi or its content.\n\nAlupas put coins into circulation in 8th century CE and continued the tradition till 14th century CE. Their coins carried the dynastic emblem of \"Two fishes over a spread Lotus flower, below a royal umbrella\". Nearly 180 unique coins have been known so far, of which around 175 coins are published in the book written by Prabhu and Pai. The detailed history, with proper reference pointers is also seen in the same book.\n\n==Epigraphs==\n[[File:M Govinda Pai Regional Research Centre Udupi 001.jpg|thumb|right|upright|300px|The Vaddarse Old Kannada inscription (650 AD) of King Aluvarasa I]]\n\nThe earliest known [[Indian copper plate inscriptions|copper plate inscription]] in Kannada language is attributed to Aluvarasa II, called the Belamannu plates and is dated the early 8th century, according to Dr. Gururaj Bhat.<ref name=\"oldest\"/> This full-length Kannada copper plates in Old Kannada script (early 8th century CE) belongs to the Alupa King Aluvarasa II from Belmannu, Karkala Taluk, Udupi District, and displays the double crested fish, the royal emblem of Alupa kings. The records also refers to the king with the title Alupendra.\n\nThe first known epigraph that talks about the possession of Banavasi Mandala (Banavasi kingdom of Uttara Kannada District) by the Alupas, belongs to the reign of Western Chalukya king Vinayaditya.<ref name=\"Ist Stone Epigraph\">Journal of the Institute of Indian Studies, 1978 May Vol#1</ref> Te epigraph comes from Jambani of Sagar Taluk, discovered by Dr Gururaj Bhat, mentions about Chitravahana Alupendra in possession of Kadamba mandala.

The Panchalingeshwara temple at Barkur, Brahmalingeshwara temple at Brahamavar, Koteshwara temple at Kotinatha and the Sadashiva temple at Suratkal are attributed to them. They used sculptural styles from their various overlords over the centuries.<ref name=\"oldest\"/>\n\n1. '''Sri Rajarajeshwari Temple, Polali'''\n[[File:Polali Shri Rajarajeshwari.jpg|thumb| Clay [[Murti]] of the Goddess Rajarajeshwari at the temple patronized by the Alupas]]\nIn modern Mangalore District, [[Polali Rajarajeshwari Temple]] is one of the oldest temple that has the earliest inscription of the Alupa dynasty, written in 8th-century Kannada. The temple is dedicated to Sri Rajarashewari, and Alupa kings enriched this temple during throughout their rule.\n\n2. '''Sri Manjunatheshwara Temple, Kadri'''\n[[File:Kadri temple.JPG|thumb|The Kadri Manjunath temple was built and patronized by the Alupas]]\nIn modern Mangalore district, Kadri has the other important and old temple that belonged to the era of Alupas. The temple has several finest bronze statues installed by the King Kundavarma, which bears inscriptions of him dated 968 CE. In the inscription of Lokeshwara statue, king Kundavarma is compared to Arjuna in bravery.\n\n3. '''Sri Mahishamardini Temple, Neelavara'''<br />\nIn times, Alupas changed their capital from Mangalore to Udyavara, Udyavara to Mangalore and then again to Barkur depending on the political situation and demand. To be in centre to their ruling place, they even shifted their capital to Barakur from where they could look after the vast territory which spread up to Ankola in the North Kanara (Uttara Kannada District).  During this period, they patronised several temples in the surrounding areas of Barakuru (which was their captiral). Neelavara Kshetra is one such a holy place where Mahishasuramardini temple has several Alupa inscriptions of later period.\n\n4. '''Sri Panchalingeshwara Temple, Vittla'''<br />\nThis temple is one of the oldest temple of Alupa territory, built during 7th century CE. The architecture of the temple is in line with that of Sri Ananteshwara temple which is the oldest temple built by the Alupas. The architecture is unique and is an innovation of 7th century. The Havyakha Brahmins of Uttara Kannada were attracted during 7th century CE by the Alupas and were given Agraharas for imparting Vedic knowledge to the people of Alvakheda.  The Alupas built many temples and allowed these Brahmins to take care of it. The legend says that there were hundreds of temples that every day there is a festival in one or other temple of the region.  The temple of Vittla Panchalingeshwara is one of the oldest structure which was renovated by the later local dynasties such as Heggades.\n\n5. '''Sri Anantheshwara Temple, Udupi'''<br />\nDiagonally opposite to the main entrance of the Sri Krishna Mutt, and adjacent to the Chandramouleeshwara Temple, stands one of the oldest Alupa temple namely '''''[[Udupi Anantheshwara Temple|Sri Anantheswara Temple]]'''''.  An old belief is that lighting a lamp at the ancient Anantheshwara Temple takes away evil and sins. It is one of the biggest temple in Udupi. The main idol is Linga, whose adornment makes it to look like a Face of Lord Siva. From a small window on the left, the site where Madhvacharya disappeared is seen.\n\nBoth Sri Vittla Panchalingeshwara and Sri Udupi Anantheshwara Temple have Elephant-back type curvilinear structure. Another temple of similar architecture is also seen in Aihole Durga temple, appears to be a structure of 7th century CE. So, tagging it to any architectural style is ruled out unless more detailed study or research is done on this topic. The unique noteworthy feature of the architecture of South Canara temples is their roof.  Being in a landscape of high rainfall, the temple roofs evolved from grass, clay tiles and eventually with the copper-plates.\n\n==Coinage==\nThe Alupas as a feudatory of the [[Western Chalukyas]] in coastal Karnataka issued coins with [[Kannada]] and [[Devanagari|Nagari]] inscriptions on them. Coins with Kannada legends seem to have minted in Mangalore and those with Nagari legend at the Udupi mint. Kannada was their language of administration. The Pagodas and Fanams were the common coinage of all the Alupa kings.  The obverse of the coins carried the royal emblem \"Two Fishes\" and the reverse had the legend \"Sri Pandya Dhanamjaya\"  either in Nagari or old (Hale) Kannada.<ref name=\"oldest\"/>\n\nThis paragraph is about the inscription found at Neelavara temple of Udupi district. This is all about the grant in \"Gadyana\" denomination. The Alupas while ruling from Barakuru showed great interest in the development of temple. This record is of the Alupa ruler Veerapandyadeva, dated 1258 CE mentions about his instruction to \"neeruvara munnuru\" i.e. Neeruvara-300, the modern Neelavara village Assembly. It states that after paying 100 gadyanas (coins) to the palace and 30 gadyanas to Adhikari, remaining 30 gadyanas, should be used by the village assembly for its expense. Yet another inscription of Veerapandyadeva's queen Ballamahadevi, the next ruler is also seen here. The record mentions that when Ballamahadevi was ruling her kingdom with the help of samastapradanas, Deshi purushas, Bahattara niyogis and Rishi Purohita, she gave a grant to Niruvara Bhagavati, out of 100 honnus that is paid to the palace. This inscription was written by Keshava Senabhova as mentioned in the epigraph.\n\nThe Alupas were one of the three dynasties that issued gold coins as early as 8th century CE. The gold that used to mint coins came from trade with the Romans, Arabs and from the adjacent kingdom of Gangas. No other ancient dynasties of the south have issued that many varieties of gold coins as Alupas and Gangas did.  The coins of both Gangas and Alupas have inscriptions that helps in dating the period of issue. Unfortunately these coins have not drawn much attention compared to that of Chalukyas or Hoysals. But for sure, they have inspired later dynasties as a prototype or basis to issue coins.

He was also recognised at regional and national levels, being named on the [[PFA Team of the Year]] twice, and recognised as the North East League Player of the Year in 2006.

After scoring 4 goals in his first 5 Premier League appearances, lifting Wednesday to the top of the league, David Pleat decided to release his mentor Waddle.

Whilst with the club, he was loaned out to [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] and [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]]. He also won five caps for England at [[England national under-20 football team|under-20]] and [[England national under-21 football team|under-21]] levels. He left the club in 2001 and joined [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]] for a short period, after which he joined [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]]. He joined [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] on loan in 2006. He left Hartlepool in July 2013, and moved on to Chesterfield. Whilst at Chesterfield in 2014 he appeared at [[Wembley Stadium]] in [[2014 Football League Trophy Final|the final]] of the [[EFL Trophy|Football League Trophy]] and helped the club to the [[EFL League Two|League Two]] title in 2013\u201314. He left Chesterfield in 2017, and went on to play for non-league side [[Sheffield F.C.|Sheffield]], until his retirement in December 2017.\n\nIn 12 seasons with Hartlepool he made a club record 544 appearances, and picked up numerous club awards, including three Player of the Year awards from fans, one Player of the Year award from his teammates, as well as the award for Player of the Decade (2000s). He was also recognised at regional and national levels, being named on the [[PFA Team of the Year]] twice, and recognised as the North East League Player of the Year in 2006. He helped the club win promotion out of the fourth tier in 2002\u201303, and again in 2006\u201307. However he suffered play-off heartbreak with the club on three separate occasions.\n\n==Childhood and early career==\nHumphreys was born in [[Sheffield]], South Yorkshire.<ref name=\"Hugman1011\"/> He was introduced to [[Association football|football]] from an early age, his [[Grandparent|grandfather]], Ernest Humphreys, played for [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] and [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]].

However, they released him when we he was 13.<ref name=\"tearstocheers\"/>\n\nHumphreys then played for the Sheffield Boys and was one of their few players who did not play for a professional club.

For the youth squad Humphreys played as a [[Midfielder#Winger|left winger]] and was offered a professional contract.<ref name=\"tearstocheers\"/> Due to the injuries of strikers [[David Hirst (footballer)|David Hirst]] and [[Mark Bright]], Wednesday manager [[David Pleat]] gave Humphreys the opportunity to go on Wednesday's [[Season (sports)#Preseason|pre-season]] tour of the Netherlands.<ref name=\"tearstocheers\"/>\n\nHumphreys played the first match and scored twice. He then played in the second match against [[FC Utrecht]] and scored again. [[Johan Cruyff]] was the guest of honour for that match and he praised Humphreys and said he was the next [[Marco van Basten]]. It was during this pre season tour that he was taken under the wing and guidance of Wednesday legend Chris Waddle. After scoring 4 goals in his first 5 Premier League appearances, lifting Wednesday to the top of the league, David Pleat decided to release his mentor Waddle.
