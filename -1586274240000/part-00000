His territories included Bavaria (where he made [[Regensburg]] the centre of his government), [[Thuringia]], [[Franconia]], and [[Saxony]].\n\nLouis may be called the founder of the [[German kingdom]], though his attempts to maintain the unity of the Empire proved futile. Having in 842 crushed the ''[[Stellinga]]'' rising in Saxony,{{sfn|Goldberg|2006|p=112}} in 844 he compelled the [[Obotrites]]{{sfn|Gwatkin|Whitney|Tanner|Previt\u00e9-Orton|Brooke|1957|p=31}} to accept his authority and put their prince, Gozzmovil, to death. [[Thachulf, Duke of Thuringia]], then undertook campaigns against the [[Bohemia]]ns, [[Great Moravia|Moravians]], and other tribes, but was not very successful in resisting the ravaging [[Vikings]].\n\n\n==Conflicts with Charles the Bald==\nIn 852 Louis sent his son [[Louis the Younger]] to [[Aquitaine]], where nobles had grown resentful of Charles the Bald's rule.{{sfn|McKitterick|1999|p=175}} The younger Louis did not set out until 854, and returned the following year.{{sfn|Reuter|2013|p=71}}\n\nStarting from 853 Louis made repeated attempts to gain the throne of [[West Francia]], which, according to the ''Annals of [[Fulda]]'' (''[[Annales Fuldenses]]''), the people of that country offered him in their disgust with the cruel misrule of Charles the Bald. Encouraged by his nephews [[Pepin_II_of_Aquitaine|Peppin II]] and [[Charles of Provence]], Louis invaded in West Francia in 858. Charles the Bald could not even raise an army to resist the invasion and fled to [[Burgundy]]. Later that year Louis issued a charter dated \"the first year of the reign in West Francia.\" However, treachery and desertion in his army, and the continued loyalty of the Aquitanian bishops to Charles the Bald, brought about the failure of the whole enterprise. As such on 7 June 860 at [[Koblenz]], both Louis and Charles made public vows to uphold the peace.{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=174}}\n\nAfter the emperor [[Lothair I]] died in 855, Louis and Charles for a time cooperated in plans to divide Lothair's possessions between themselves, the only impediments to this being Lothair's sons and heirs \u2013 [[Lothair II]] (who received [[Lotharingia]]), [[Louis II of Italy]] (who held the imperial title and the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]]) and [[Charles of Provence]]. In 868 at [[Metz]] Louis and Charles agreed to partition [[Lotharingia]]. When Lothair II died in 869, Louis was lying seriously ill, and his armies were engaged in a war with the Moravians. Charles the Bald quickly seized Lothair's lands, but Louis, having recovered, compelled him by threat of war to agree to the [[Treaty of Meerssen]], which divided Lothair's lands among all the claimants.{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=199}}\n\n==''Divisio regni'' among the sons==\n[[File:Torhalle Kloster Lorsch.jpg|thumb|Carolingian gatehouse (''Torhalle'') to [[Lorsch Abbey]], where Louis the German was buried]]\nThe later years of Louis the German were troubled by rebellions of his sons. The eldest, [[Carloman of Bavaria]], revolted in 861 and again two years later. This was followed by the second son [[Louis the Younger]], who was joined by his brother [[Charles the Fat]]. In 864 Louis was forced to grant Carloman the kingdom of Bavaria, which he himself had once held under his father. In 865 he divided the remainder of his lands \u2013 [[Saxony]] with [[Franconia]] and [[Thuringia]] went to Louis the Younger and [[Swabia]] with [[Raetia]] to Charles the Fat.\n\nA report that the emperor [[Louis II of Italy]] had died led to a peace between father and sons and attempts by Louis the German to gain the imperial crown for his oldest son Carloman. These efforts were thwarted by Louis II of Italy who was in fact not dead, and Louis' old adversary, Charles the Bald.\n\nLouis was preparing for a new war when he died on August 28, 876 in [[Frankfurt]]. He was buried at the [[abbey]] of [[Lorsch]], leaving three sons and three daughters. His sons, despite their earlier behaviour, respected the divisions made a decade earlier and each contented himself with his own kingdom.\n\n==Later Life==\n\n[[File:GrabplatteLudwig_Ludwig_III_Kunigunde.JPG|thumb|Commemorative plaque for Louis III]]\n\nIn the years 872 and 873, ambassadors of the Eastern Roman Emperor Basil I came to Louis in Regensburg and showed that his rule was perceived as far as Constantinople. After the death of Emperor Louis II in August 875, Louis tried to win the emperorship for himself and his descendants. For this purpose, Abbot Sigihard von Fulda undertook a trip to Rome to Pope John VIII. On 18 May 876 he returned to Ingelheim and reported to Louis that, in December 875, Charles the Bald had been able to obtain the title of emperor by a swift move to Rome.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hartmann |first1=Wilfried |title=Ludwig der Deutsche |date=Darmstadt |pages=120\u2013122}}</ref>\n\nHis wife Hemma visited Louis for the last time in May 875. In 874 she had lost her voice as a result of a stroke. During his stay, he donated the [[Berg im Donaugau Abbey]] to the Marienkapelle, which he built.<ref>Wilfried Hartmann: Ludwig der Deutsche \u2013 Portrait eines wenig bekannten K\u00f6nigs. In: Wilfried Hartmann (Hrsg.): Ludwig der Deutsche und seine Zeit. Darmstadt 2004, S. 1\u201326, hier: S. 7f.</ref> Hemma died at the end of January 876 in Regensburg. Louis then died after a short illness on 28 August 876 in his palace in Frankfurt. The following day he was buried by his son Louis in Lorsch Abbey. However, according to Wilfried Hartmann, it cannot be determined with certainty whether the dead man in his sarcophagus is the Carolingian king.<ref>Wilfried Hartmann: Ludwig der Deutsche. Darmstadt 2002, S. 62.</ref> After Louis' death, Charles the Bald tried to win over the East Reich as well. However, Louis the Younger defeated him on 8 October 876 at Andernach with a squad of Franks, Saxons and Thuringians. One year later, Charles the Bald died.\n\n==Louis' Rule==\n\nAs there exist only 172 royal documents from 50 years of reign, it is impossible to create a detailed picture of Louis' whereabouts in the East Frankish empire. By comparison, Louis the Pious had 18 certificates created per year, and his half-brother Charles the Bald had 12 produced annually.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hartmann |first1=Wilfried |title=Ludwig der Deutsche |date=2002 |publisher=Darmstadt}}</ref> This pattern of not producing many documents lasts for several months at certain times. For example, it is completely uncertain where the East Frankish king stayed between June 849 and July 850.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Deutinger |first1=Roman |title=Hludovicus rex Baioariae. Zur Rolle Bayerns in der Politik Ludwigs des Deutschen |date=2002 |publisher=Darmstadt |page=55}}</ref> At least 52 documents are addressed to Bavarian beneficiaries. However, the intensity of the documentary production for Bavarian recipients steadily decreased during his reign.\n\nAs former [[stem-duchy]], the Rhine-Main area contained Frankfurt, Mainz and Worms, and had plenty of [[Kaiserpfalz|Imperial Palaces]] and treasuries. Since it was located in the geographic centre of the East Frankish Empire, it was easily accessible by road. As a result, it was the region in which most East Frankish synods and imperial assemblies were hosted.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Deutinger |first1=Roman |title=K\u00f6nigsherrschaft im Ostfr\u00e4nkischen Reich.

Having in 842 crushed the ''[[Stellinga]]'' rising in Saxony,{{sfn|Goldberg|2006|p=112}} in 844 he compelled the [[Obotrites]]{{sfn|Gwatkin|Whitney|Tanner|Previt\u00e9-Orton|Brooke|1957|p=31}} to accept his authority and put their prince, Gozzmovil, to death. [[Thachulf, Duke of Thuringia]], then undertook campaigns against the [[Bohemia]]ns, [[Great Moravia|Moravians]], and other tribes, but was not very successful in resisting the ravaging [[Vikings]].\n\n\n==Conflicts with Charles the Bald==\nIn 852 Louis sent his son [[Louis the Younger]] to [[Aquitaine]], where nobles had grown resentful of Charles the Bald's rule.{{sfn|McKitterick|1999|p=175}} The younger Louis did not set out until 854, and returned the following year.{{sfn|Reuter|2013|p=71}}\n\nStarting from 853 Louis made repeated attempts to gain the throne of [[West Francia]], which, according to the ''Annals of [[Fulda]]'' (''[[Annales Fuldenses]]''), the people of that country offered him in their disgust with the cruel misrule of Charles the Bald. Encouraged by his nephews [[Pepin_II_of_Aquitaine|Peppin II]] and [[Charles of Provence]], Louis invaded in West Francia in 858. Charles the Bald could not even raise an army to resist the invasion and fled to [[Burgundy]]. Later that year Louis issued a charter dated \"the first year of the reign in West Francia.\" However, treachery and desertion in his army, and the continued loyalty of the Aquitanian bishops to Charles the Bald, brought about the failure of the whole enterprise. As such on 7 June 860 at [[Koblenz]], both Louis and Charles made public vows to uphold the peace.{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=174}}\n\nAfter the emperor [[Lothair I]] died in 855, Louis and Charles for a time cooperated in plans to divide Lothair's possessions between themselves, the only impediments to this being Lothair's sons and heirs \u2013 [[Lothair II]] (who received [[Lotharingia]]), [[Louis II of Italy]] (who held the imperial title and the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]]) and [[Charles of Provence]]. In 868 at [[Metz]] Louis and Charles agreed to partition [[Lotharingia]]. When Lothair II died in 869, Louis was lying seriously ill, and his armies were engaged in a war with the Moravians. Charles the Bald quickly seized Lothair's lands, but Louis, having recovered, compelled him by threat of war to agree to the [[Treaty of Meerssen]], which divided Lothair's lands among all the claimants.{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=199}}\n\n==''Divisio regni'' among the sons==\n[[File:Torhalle Kloster Lorsch.jpg|thumb|Carolingian gatehouse (''Torhalle'') to [[Lorsch Abbey]], where Louis the German was buried]]\nThe later years of Louis the German were troubled by rebellions of his sons. The eldest, [[Carloman of Bavaria]], revolted in 861 and again two years later. This was followed by the second son [[Louis the Younger]], who was joined by his brother [[Charles the Fat]]. In 864 Louis was forced to grant Carloman the kingdom of Bavaria, which he himself had once held under his father. In 865 he divided the remainder of his lands \u2013 [[Saxony]] with [[Franconia]] and [[Thuringia]] went to Louis the Younger and [[Swabia]] with [[Raetia]] to Charles the Fat.\n\nA report that the emperor [[Louis II of Italy]] had died led to a peace between father and sons and attempts by Louis the German to gain the imperial crown for his oldest son Carloman. These efforts were thwarted by Louis II of Italy who was in fact not dead, and Louis' old adversary, Charles the Bald.\n\nLouis was preparing for a new war when he died on August 28, 876 in [[Frankfurt]]. He was buried at the [[abbey]] of [[Lorsch]], leaving three sons and three daughters. His sons, despite their earlier behaviour, respected the divisions made a decade earlier and each contented himself with his own kingdom.\n\n==Later Life==\n\n[[File:GrabplatteLudwig_Ludwig_III_Kunigunde.JPG|thumb|Commemorative plaque for Louis III]]\n\nIn the years 872 and 873, ambassadors of the Eastern Roman Emperor Basil I came to Louis in Regensburg and showed that his rule was perceived as far as Constantinople. After the death of Emperor Louis II in August 875, Louis tried to win the emperorship for himself and his descendants. For this purpose, Abbot Sigihard von Fulda undertook a trip to Rome to Pope John VIII. On 18 May 876 he returned to Ingelheim and reported to Louis that, in December 875, Charles the Bald had been able to obtain the title of emperor by a swift move to Rome.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hartmann |first1=Wilfried |title=Ludwig der Deutsche |date=Darmstadt |pages=120\u2013122}}</ref>\n\nHis wife Hemma visited Louis for the last time in May 875. In 874 she had lost her voice as a result of a stroke. During his stay, he donated the [[Berg im Donaugau Abbey]] to the Marienkapelle, which he built.<ref>Wilfried Hartmann: Ludwig der Deutsche \u2013 Portrait eines wenig bekannten K\u00f6nigs. In: Wilfried Hartmann (Hrsg.): Ludwig der Deutsche und seine Zeit. Darmstadt 2004, S. 1\u201326, hier: S. 7f.</ref> Hemma died at the end of January 876 in Regensburg. Louis then died after a short illness on 28 August 876 in his palace in Frankfurt. The following day he was buried by his son Louis in Lorsch Abbey. However, according to Wilfried Hartmann, it cannot be determined with certainty whether the dead man in his sarcophagus is the Carolingian king.<ref>Wilfried Hartmann: Ludwig der Deutsche. Darmstadt 2002, S. 62.</ref> After Louis' death, Charles the Bald tried to win over the East Reich as well. However, Louis the Younger defeated him on 8 October 876 at Andernach with a squad of Franks, Saxons and Thuringians. One year later, Charles the Bald died.\n\n==Louis' Rule==\n\nDue to the small number of 172 royal documents from 50 years of reign, it is impossible to create a detailed picture of Louis' whereabouts in the East Frankish empire. For comparison, Louis the Pious had 18 certificates created a year, and his half-brother Charles the Bald had 12 produced per year.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hartmann |first1=Wilfried |title=Ludwig der Deutsche |date=2002 |publisher=Darmstadt}}</ref> This tradition of not producing many documents lasts for several months at certain times. For example, it is completely uncertain where the East Frankish king stayed between June 849 and July 850.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Deutinger |first1=Roman |title=Hludovicus rex Baioariae. Zur Rolle Bayerns in der Politik Ludwigs des Deutschen |date=2002 |publisher=Darmstadt |page=55}}</ref> At least 52 documents are addressed to Bavarian beneficiaries. However, the intensity of the documentary production for Bavarian recipients steadily decreased during his reign.\n\nAs former [[stem-duchy]], the Rhine-Main area contained Frankfurt, Mainz and Worms. It had plenty of [[Kaiserpfalz|Imperial Palaces]] and treasuries . Since it was located in the geographic centre of the East Frankish Empire, it was easily accessible by road. As a result, it was the region in which most East Frankish synods and imperial assemblies were hosted.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Deutinger |first1=Roman |title=K\u00f6nigsherrschaft im Ostfr\u00e4nkischen Reich.

He was the younger brother of Professor [[Walter Garstang]], FRS, a marine biologist and zoologist.

In 1902 he carried out his first independent excavation in Egypt at [[Ar Raq\u0101qinah|Reqaqnah]].

He was the younger brother of Professor [[Walter Garstang]], FRS, a marine biologist and zoologist. Garstang is considered a pioneer in the development of scientific practices in archaeology as he kept detailed records of his excavations with extensive photographic records, which was a comparatively rare practice in early 20th-century archaeology<ref name = \"Garnett\"/>\n\n==Biography==\nJohn Garstang was born in [[Blackburn]] on 5 May 1876, the sixth child of Walter and Matilda Garstang.<ref name=\"ONB\">{{cite encyclopedia\n| title = Garstang, John (1876\u20131956)\n| encyclopedia = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\n| last1 = Gurney\n| first1 = O R\n| last2 = Freeman\n| first2 = P W M\n| publisher = Oxford University Press\n| date = May 2012\n| url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33341\n| accessdate = 2016-05-22}}</ref> He was educated at [[Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, Blackburn|Blackburn Grammar School]] and in 1895 he obtained a scholarship for [[Jesus College, Oxford]] to study mathematics.<ref name=\"ONB\"/> While at Oxford, Garstang became interested in archaeology and conducted excavations at [[Bremetennacum|Ribchester]].<ref name=\"ONB\"/> Encouraged to take up archaeology, Garstang excavated other [[Romano-British]] sites  during his vacations from Oxford.<ref name=\"ONB\"/>\n\nAfter gaining a [[British_undergraduate_degree_classification#Third-class_honours|3rd]] from Oxford in 1899, Garstang joined the team of [[Flinders Petrie]] at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]]. He excavated various sites in the vicinity, including the discovery of the great tombs at [[Beit Khallaf]] in 1901. In 1902 he carried out his first independent excavation in Egypt at [[Ar Raq\u0101qinah|Reqaqnah]]. The excavation was funded by an excavation committee, a group of wealthy donors who in turn would receive a selection of objects from Garstang's excavations in exchange for their patronage.<ref name = \"Garnett\">{{Citation\n | last = Garnett\n | first = Anna\n | title = John Rankin and John Garstang: Funding Egyptology in a Pioneering Age\n | url = https://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/research/directory/material_culture_wengrow/Anna_Garnett.pdf\n | access-date = 2016-05-22\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160617142729/https://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/research/directory/material_culture_wengrow/Anna_Garnett.pdf\n | archive-date = 2016-06-17\n | url-status = dead\n }}</ref> Like Petrie before him, Garstang would continue to use Excavation Committees to fund his excavations for most of his career.\n\nIn 1902, Garstang was also appointed the honorary reader in Egyptian archaeology at the [[University of Liverpool]].<ref name=\"ONB\"/> In 1904, Garstang founded the [[University of Liverpool Department of Archaeology, Classics and Egyptology |Institute of Archaeology]], which was affiliated with the University.<ref name=\"about Museum\">{{Citation\n | last = Garstang Museum of Archaeology\n | title = About the Museum\n | publisher = University of Liverpool\n | url = https://garstangmuseum.wordpress.com/about/\n | access-date = 2016-05-22 }}</ref> From 1907&ndash;41, Garstang was the first professorship in the methods and practice of archaeology at the University.

{"title_page": "Gotthard Deutsch", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{No footnotes|date=September 2010}}\n\n[[File:Gotthard Deutsch.jpg|thumb|Gotthard Deutsch]]\n\n'''Gotthard Deutsch''' (31 January 1859 \u2013 14 October 1921), also spelled '''Gottard Deutsch''', was a scholar of [[Jewish history]].\n\n== Education ==\nDeutsch was born in [[Doln\u00ed Kounice]], [[Moravia]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], as '''Eliezer Deutsch''', the son of Bernhard L. Deutsch, a merchant, and Elise Wiener. He always called himself Gotthard, an attempted translation into German of his [[Jew]]ish given name. Deutsch entered [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau]] in October 1876. While attending seminary classes, he also enrolled in afternoon classes at the [[University of Breslau]]. At the seminary, he was influenced by the noted Jewish historian [[Heinrich Graetz]]. Matriculating in 1879 at the [[University of Vienna]], two years later he received his Ph.D. in history. While attending the university, he enrolled in a [[Talmud]]ic course taught by [[Isaac Hirsch Weiss]] at [[Beth Hammidrash]]. During his studies in [[Vienna]], Deutsch drew inspiration and guidance from both Weiss and [[Adolf Jellinek]], an authority in [[Midrash]]ic research. Shortly after his graduation, Deutsch received Semichah (ordination) from Weiss.\n\n== Rabbinical and academic career ==\nIn 1881 Deutsch accepted a probational position as [[shabbath]] schoolteacher for a Jewish congregation in [[Brno]], [[Moravia]]. The following year he was appointed to teach religion at the city's German high school. After teaching for six years (1881\u20131887) at Brno, he entered the [[rabbi]]nate. His first and only charge came in 1887, in the town of [[Most (Most District)|Most]], [[Bohemia]]. Deutsch was far from content at his new vocation. Soon, he yearned for an academic milieu and the opportunity of satisfying his craving for knowledge. While at Most he married in May 1888 Hermine Bacher; the couple had three sons and two daughters.\n\nIn 1891, at the invitation of [[Isaac Mayer Wise]], Deutsch moved to the United States to accept the chair of Jewish history and philosophy at [[Hebrew Union College]] in [[Cincinnati]]. After eleven years of teaching there, he was appointed dean. In February 1903, after the death of [[Moses Mielziner]], he was designated acting president of the college, a position he held until October of the same year.\n\nIn 1912 Deutsch delivered lectures on Jewish history at the [[University of Chicago]]. While speaking at schools throughout the United States, Deutsch was also a guiding force at the local level. This included his association with the Cincinnati German Club and in 1909 his election to the [[Cincinnati Board of Education]], a position he held for four years. Much of Deutsch's time was also spent as an editor and chief contributor to the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]], as corresponding secretary for the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]], and as chairman of the conference's Committee on Contemporaneous History.\n\n== World War I position ==\nOne of the turning points in Deutsch's life came with the [[American entry into World War I|United States's entry into World War I]]. His lifelong love for Germany had led Deutsch to support [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s neutrality while aligning himself with the [[People's Council of America for Democracy and Peace]]. In the tide of anti-German hysteria, Deutsch found himself alone and ostracized. He spoke out singularly, sometimes bitterly, against his adopted country's wartime role. On 5 October 1917, federal agents and local detectives raided the council's headquarters.\n\nShortly thereafter, at a friend's [[naturalization]] hearing, Deutsch refused to answer the question \"Who do you want to win in this war?\" These activities and subsequent newspaper headlines led many colleagues and the public to demand his immediate removal from the college's faculty. Only the staunch support of his students, friends, and leading [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] rabbis enabled Deutsch to continue teaching.\n\n==Death==\nDeutsch died at his home in [[Cincinnati]]. He was mourned by Jew and non-Jew, progressive and conservative; thousands filled the Cincinnati Crematory to pay their last respects.\n\n== Work and legacy ==\nAlthough a biblical scholar, Deutsch is also known for his two novels and works on history and language. One of the world's greatest Jewish scholars, Deutsch possessed a knack for memorizing facts, biblical scriptures, secular literature, and world history. He also wrote in several languages, including [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], German, French, and English. Above all, however, Deutsch's gentlemanly traits separated and lifted him above the mundane.\n\nA prolific writer, Deutsch produced hundreds of newspaper and journal articles with commentary; these appeared mainly in the ''[[Jewish Chronicle]]'', ''[[American Hebrew]]'', ''[[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] Yearbook'', ''[[Hebrew Union College Journal]]'', ''[[American Israelite]]'', and ''[[American Journal of Theology]]''. Besides contributing to ''[[Die Deborah]]'', he succeeded [[Isaac Mayer Wise|Isaac Wise]] in 1901 as its editor. His list of scholarly works is equally impressive:\n\n* ''Paradigmen-Tafeln zur hebr\u00e4ischen Grammatik'' (1886)\n* ''Die Symbolik in Cultus und Dichtung bei den Hebr\u00e4ern'' (1886)\n* ''Philosophy of Jewish History'' (1897)\n* ''Andere Zeiten, eine Erz\u00e4hlung aus dem j\u00fcdischen Leben der j\u00fcngsten Vergangenheit'' (1898)\n* ''Unl\u00f6sbare Fesseln, eine Erz\u00e4hlung aus dem j\u00fcdischen Leben der Gegenwart'' (1903)\n* ''Memorable Dates of Jewish History'' (1904)\n* ''Four Epochs of Jewish History'' (1905)\n* ''Israel Bruna, an Historical Tragedy in Five Acts'' (1908)\n* ''The History of the Jews'' (1910)\n* ''Der Glaube an Hobelsp\u00e4ne'' (1914)\n* ''Scrolls'' (2 vols., 1917; 3rd vol., 1919), and other pamphlets and reprints. His works are considered by many to be the authoritative word on questions relating to [[Judaism|the Jewish faith]].\n\n== Sources ==\n* The ''Bernhard Felsenthal Papers'', in the Hebrew Jewish Archives, contain an extensive record of correspondences between Deutsch and Felsenthal.\n* Adolph S. Oko, ''Selected List of the Writings of Gotthard Deutsch'' (1916), presents an extensive bibliography of Deutsch's major publications.\n* Biographical sketches of Deutsch are in Max Raisin, ''Great Jews I Have Known'' (1952), pp.&nbsp;143\u201352, and an excellent unpublished sketch by Raisin in the Hebrew Jewish Archives.\n*Celebrating Deutsch's semi-jubilee, the ''Hebrew Union College Monthly'' (2, no. 8 [May 1916]) published a series of tributes and editorials by E. L. Heinsheimer, Henry Englander, Abraham Jehiel Feldman, S. Felix Mendelsohn, H. B. Cantor, and Jacob I. Meyer, among others.

Deutsch, a merchant, and Elise Wiener. He always called himself Gotthard, an attempted translation into German of his [[Jew]]ish given name. Deutsch entered [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau]] in October 1876. While attending seminary classes, he also enrolled in afternoon classes at the [[University of Breslau]]. At the seminary, he was influenced by the noted Jewish historian [[Heinrich Graetz]]. Matriculating in 1879 at the [[University of Vienna]], two years later he received his Ph.D. in history. While attending the university, he enrolled in a [[Talmud]]ic course taught by [[Isaac Hirsch Weiss]] at [[Beth Hammidrash]]. During his studies in [[Vienna]], Deutsch drew inspiration and guidance from both Weiss and [[Adolf Jellinek]], an authority in [[Midrash]]ic research. Shortly after his graduation, Deutsch received Semichah (ordination) from Weiss.\n\n== Rabbinical and academic career ==\nIn 1881 Deutsch accepted a probational position as [[shabbath]] schoolteacher for a Jewish congregation in [[Brno]], [[Moravia]]. The following year he was appointed to teach religion at the city's German high school. After teaching for six years (1881\u20131887) at Brno, he entered the [[rabbi]]nate. His first and only charge came in 1887, in the town of [[Most (Most District)|Most]], [[Bohemia]]. Deutsch was far from content at his new vocation. Soon, he yearned for an academic milieu and the opportunity of satisfying his craving for knowledge. While at Most he married in May 1888 Hermine Bacher; the couple had three sons and two daughters.\n\nIn 1891, at the invitation of [[Isaac Mayer Wise]], Deutsch moved to the United States to accept the chair of Jewish history and philosophy at [[Hebrew Union College]] in [[Cincinnati]]. After eleven years of teaching there, he was appointed dean. In February 1903, after the death of [[Moses Mielziner]], he was designated acting president of the college, a position he held until October of the same year.\n\nIn 1912 Deutsch delivered lectures on Jewish history at the [[University of Chicago]]. While speaking at schools throughout the United States, Deutsch was also a guiding force at the local level. This included his association with the Cincinnati German Club and in 1909 his election to the [[Cincinnati Board of Education]], a position he held for four years. Much of Deutsch's time was also spent as an editor and chief contributor to the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]], as corresponding secretary for the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]], and as chairman of the conference's Committee on Contemporaneous History.\n\n== World War I position ==\nOne of the turning points in Deutsch's life came with the [[American entry into World War I|United States's entry into World War I]]. His lifelong love for Germany had led Deutsch to support [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s neutrality while aligning himself with the [[People's Council of America for Democracy and Peace]]. In the tide of anti-German hysteria, Deutsch found himself alone and ostracized. He spoke out singularly, sometimes bitterly, against his adopted country's wartime role. On 5 October 1917, federal agents and local detectives raided the council's headquarters.\n\nShortly thereafter, at a friend's [[naturalization]] hearing, Deutsch refused to answer the question \"Who do you want to win in this war?\" These activities and subsequent newspaper headlines led many colleagues and the public to demand his immediate removal from the college's faculty. Only the staunch support of his students, friends, and leading [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] rabbis enabled Deutsch to continue teaching.\n\n==Death==\nDeutsch died at his home in [[Cincinnati]]. He was mourned by Jew and non-Jew, progressive and conservative; thousands filled the Cincinnati Crematory to pay their last respects.\n\n== Work and legacy ==\nAlthough a biblical scholar, Deutsch is also known for his two novels and works on history and language. One of the world's greatest Jewish scholars, Deutsch possessed a knack for memorizing facts, biblical scriptures, secular literature, and world history. He also wrote in several languages, including [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], German, French, and English. Above all, however, Deutsch's gentlemanly traits separated and lifted him above the mundane.\n\nA prolific writer, Deutsch produced hundreds of newspaper and journal articles with commentary; these appeared mainly in the ''[[Jewish Chronicle]]'', ''[[American Hebrew]]'', ''[[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] Yearbook'', ''[[Hebrew Union College Journal]]'', ''[[American Israelite]]'', and ''[[American Journal of Theology]]''. Besides contributing to ''[[Die Deborah]]'', he succeeded [[Isaac Mayer Wise|Isaac Wise]] in 1901 as its editor. His list of scholarly works is equally impressive:\n\n* ''Paradigmen-Tafeln zur hebr\u00e4ischen Grammatik'' (1886)\n* ''Die Symbolik in Cultus und Dichtung bei den Hebr\u00e4ern'' (1886)\n* ''Philosophy of Jewish History'' (1897)\n* ''Andere Zeiten, eine Erz\u00e4hlung aus dem j\u00fcdischen Leben der j\u00fcngsten Vergangenheit'' (1898)\n* ''Unl\u00f6sbare Fesseln, eine Erz\u00e4hlung aus dem j\u00fcdischen Leben der Gegenwart'' (1903)\n* ''Memorable Dates of Jewish History'' (1904)\n* ''Four Epochs of Jewish History'' (1905)\n* ''Israel Bruna, an Historical Tragedy in Five Acts'' (1908)\n* ''The History of the Jews'' (1910)\n* ''Der Glaube an Hobelsp\u00e4ne'' (1914)\n* ''Scrolls'' (2 vols., 1917; 3rd vol., 1919), and other pamphlets and reprints. His works are considered by many to be the authoritative word on questions relating to [[Judaism|the Jewish faith]].\n\n== Sources ==\n* The ''Bernhard Felsenthal Papers'', in the Hebrew Jewish Archives, contain an extensive record of correspondences between Deutsch and Felsenthal.\n* Adolph S. Oko, ''Selected List of the Writings of Gotthard Deutsch'' (1916), presents an extensive bibliography of Deutsch's major publications.\n* Biographical sketches of Deutsch are in Max Raisin, ''Great Jews I Have Known'' (1952), pp.&nbsp;143\u201352, and an excellent unpublished sketch by Raisin in the Hebrew Jewish Archives.\n*Celebrating Deutsch's semi-jubilee, the ''Hebrew Union College Monthly'' (2, no. 8 [May 1916]) published a series of tributes and editorials by E. L. Heinsheimer, Henry Englander, Abraham Jehiel Feldman, S. Felix Mendelsohn, H. B. Cantor, and Jacob I. Meyer, among others.

Launched in 1751, she was used as a [[survey ship]] from 1764 and made two [[circumnavigation]]s of the world under the successive commands of [[John Byron]] and [[Samuel Wallis]]. She was the first ship to circumnavigate the world twice. She remained in service until she was [[Ship commissioning#Ship_decommissioning|paid off]] in September 1776, and she was broken up in early 1777.<ref>{{cite book |last=Paine |first=Lincoln P. |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=Ships of Discovery and Exploration |month= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J9W4QO1b_A8C |format= |accessdate=31 December 2011 |edition= |date= |year=2000 |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] |location=[[Boston]], [[New York City|New York]] |isbn=0-395-98415-7 |id= |doi= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |pages=45\u201346}}</ref>\n\n==Construction==\nBuilt to the [[1745 Establishment]], ''Dolphin'' was originally ordered from the private yard of Earlsman Sparrow in [[Rotherhithe]] (under contract dated 7 October 1747). Following Sparrow's bankruptcy in 1748, the order was moved to [[Woolwich]] Dockyard. In order to reduce the likely incidence of [[shipworm]], ''Dolphin''{{'}}s hull was [[copper sheathing|copper-sheathed]] ahead of her first voyage of circumnavigation in 1764.<ref>Beaglehole 1966, p.195</ref>\n\n== Early service ==\nNot long after her commissioning, the hostilities of the [[Seven Years' War]] had escalated and spread to [[Europe]], and in May 1756 Britain declared war on [[France]] of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]. ''Dolphin'' was pressed into service throughout the conflict, and was present at the [[Battle of Minorca (1756)|Battle of Minorca in 1756]] when a fleet under Admiral [[John Byng]] failed to relieve Port [[Mahon]], Britain's main base in the Western Mediterranean (as a result of which Byng was later [[court-martial]]led and shot).\n\n== First circumnavigation ==\nWith Britain's successful conclusion of the Seven Years' War in 1763, her attentions turned towards consolidating her gains and continuing to expand her trade and influence at the expense of the other competing European powers. The [[Pacific Ocean]] was beginning to be opened up by exploratory European vessels, and interest had developed in this route as an alternate to reach the [[East Indies]]. This interest was compounded by theories put forward which suggested that a large, hitherto-unknown continental landmass (''[[Terra Australis Incognita]]'') must exist at southern [[latitude]]s to \"counterbalance\" the northern hemisphere's landmasses.\n\nNo longer in a state of war, the [[Admiralty]] had more funds, ships and men at her disposal to devote to exploratory ventures. Accordingly, an expedition was soon formed with instructions to investigate and establish a [[South Atlantic]] base from which Britain could keep an eye on voyages bound for the Pacific. Another purpose was to generally explore for unknown lands which could then be claimed and exploited by the Crown, and to reach the [[Far East]] if necessary. The ''Dolphin'' was selected as lead vessel for this voyage, and she was to be accompanied by the [[sloop]] [[HMS Tamar (1758)|HMS ''Tamar'']].\n\nHer captain was [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[John Byron]], a 42-year-old veteran of the sea, and younger brother to the profligate [[William Byron, 5th Baron Byron]]. Between June 1764 and May 1766 HMS ''Dolphin'' completed the circumnavigation of the globe. This was the first such circumnavigation of less than 2 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.solarnavigator.net/circumnavigation.htm |title=Circumnavigation: Notable global maritime circumnavigations |publisher=Solarnavigator.net |date= |accessdate=2009-07-20}}</ref> During this voyage, in 1765, Byron took possession of the [[Falkland Islands]] on behalf of Britain on the grounds of prior discovery, and in so doing was [[Falkland Crisis (1770)|nearly the cause of a war]] between [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Spain]], both countries having armed fleets ready to contest the  sovereignty of the barren islands. Later Byron visited islands of [[Tuamotus]], [[Tokelau]] and [[Nikunau]] in the [[Gilbert Islands]], putting them on European maps for the first time (in European circles, Nikunau went by the name \"Byron Island\" for over 100 years); and visited [[Tinian]] in the [[Northern Marianas Islands]].\n\n==Second circumnavigation==\n[[File:Memorial to Samuel Wallis in Truro Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Memorial to Samuel Wallis and the crew in [[Truro Cathedral]]]]\n''Dolphin'' circumnavigated the world for a second time, under the command of [[Samuel Wallis]]. Her [[master's mate]], [[John Gore (seaman)|John Gore]], was among a number of the crew from Byron's circumnavigation who crewed with Wallis. The master on this voyage, George Robertson, subsequently wrote a book ''The discovery of Tahiti; a journal of the second voyage of H.M.S. Dolphin round the world under the command of Captain Wallis, R.N., in the years 1766, 1767, and 1768, written by her master''.<ref>[http://www.alibris.com/search/books/author/Robertson,%20George,%20master%20of%20H.%20M.%20S.%20Dolphin Alibris]</ref> ''Dolphin'' sailed in 1766 in the company of HMS ''Swallow'', under the command of [[Philip Carteret]], who had served on Byron's circumnavigation.\n\n''Dolphin'' dropped anchor at the peninsula of Tahiti Iti (\"small Tahiti\", aka Taiarapu) on 17 June 1767 but quickly left to find a better anchorage. Wallis chose [[Matavai Bay]] on 23 June. Although the Spanish had visited the [[Marquesas Islands]] in 1595, some 170 years earlier, Wallis officially took possession of Otaheiti, which he named \"King George III Island\". (About a year later, French navigator [[Louis-Antoine de Bougainville]] landed at Hitiaa on the opposite side of Tahiti and unaware of Wallis's earlier visit, claimed it for the King of France.)\n\nEarly on a large canoe approached ''Dolphin'' and at a signal its occupants launched a storm of stones at the British, who replied with [[grapeshot]]. ''Dolphin's'' gunnery cut the canoe in two, killing most of its occupants. Wallis then sent his carpenters ashore to cut the eighty-some canoes there in half. Eventually, friendly relations were established between the British sailors and the locals. The relationships became particularly friendly when the sailors discovered that the women were eager to exchange sex for iron. This trade became so extensive that the loss of nails started to threaten ''Dolphin's'' physical integrity.<ref>Couper (2009), pp. 64\u201365, 69.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[European and American voyages of scientific exploration]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite book |title =From Sailors and Traders: A Maritime History of the Pacific Peoples | first =Alistair | last =Couper | year =2009 | publisher =University of Hawai'i Press | isbn =\n9781441619884}}\n* {{cite book | last = Winfield| first = Rif|title = British Warships of the Age of Sail 1714\u20131792: Design, Construction, Careers and Fates | publisher =  Seaforth| year = 2007|isbn=9781844157006}}\n* {{cite book |title =The Exploration of the Pacific | first =J.C. | last =Beaglehole |author-link=John Cawte Beaglehole| year =1966 | publisher =Adam & Charles Black, London | oclc = 422331302}}\n* {{cite web | title=HMS ''Dolphin'' | work=Ships of the World: an Historical Encyclopaedia | url=http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/ships/html/sh_027600_hmsdolphin.htm | accessdate=15 August 2005 }}\nOfficer on Board the Said Ship.

She remained in service until she was [[Ship commissioning#Ship_decommissioning|paid off]] in September 1776, and she was broken up in early 1777.<ref>{{cite book |last=Paine |first=Lincoln P. |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=Ships of Discovery and Exploration |month= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J9W4QO1b_A8C |format= |accessdate=31 December 2011 |edition= |date= |year=2000 |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] |location=[[Boston]], [[New York City|New York]] |isbn=0-395-98415-7 |id= |doi= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |pages=45\u201346}}</ref>\n\n==Construction==\nBuilt to the [[1745 Establishment]], ''Dolphin'' was originally ordered from the private yard of Earlsman Sparrow in [[Rotherhithe]] (under contract dated 7 October 1747). Following Sparrow's bankruptcy in 1748, the order was moved to [[Woolwich]] Dockyard. In order to reduce the likely incidence of [[shipworm]], ''Dolphin''{{'}}s hull was [[copper sheathing|copper-sheathed]] ahead of her first voyage of circumnavigation in 1764.<ref>Beaglehole 1966, p.195</ref>\n\n== Early service ==\nNot long after her commissioning, the hostilities of the [[Seven Years' War]] had escalated and spread to [[Europe]], and in May 1756 Britain declared war on [[France]] of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]. ''Dolphin'' was pressed into service throughout the conflict, and was present at the [[Battle of Minorca (1756)|Battle of Minorca in 1756]] when a fleet under Admiral [[John Byng]] failed to relieve Port [[Mahon]], Britain's main base in the Western Mediterranean (as a result of which Byng was later [[court-martial]]led and shot).\n\n== First circumnavigation ==\nWith Britain's successful conclusion of the Seven Years' War in 1763, her attentions turned towards consolidating her gains and continuing to expand her trade and influence at the expense of the other competing European powers. The [[Pacific Ocean]] was beginning to be opened up by exploratory European vessels, and interest had developed in this route as an alternate to reach the [[East Indies]]. This interest was compounded by theories put forward which suggested that a large, hitherto-unknown continental landmass (''[[Terra Australis Incognita]]'') must exist at southern [[latitude]]s to \"counterbalance\" the northern hemisphere's landmasses.\n\nNo longer in a state of war, the [[Admiralty]] had more funds, ships and men at her disposal to devote to exploratory ventures. Accordingly, an expedition was soon formed with instructions to investigate and establish a [[South Atlantic]] base from which Britain could keep an eye on voyages bound for the Pacific. Another purpose was to generally explore for unknown lands which could then be claimed and exploited by the Crown, and to reach the [[Far East]] if necessary. The ''Dolphin'' was selected as lead vessel for this voyage, and she was to be accompanied by the [[sloop]] [[HMS Tamar (1758)|HMS ''Tamar'']].\n\nHer captain was [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[John Byron]], a 42-year-old veteran of the sea, and younger brother to the profligate [[William Byron, 5th Baron Byron]]. Between June 1764 and May 1766 HMS ''Dolphin'' completed the circumnavigation of the globe. This was the first such circumnavigation of less than 2 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.solarnavigator.net/circumnavigation.htm |title=Circumnavigation: Notable global maritime circumnavigations |publisher=Solarnavigator.net |date= |accessdate=2009-07-20}}</ref> During this voyage, in 1765, Byron took possession of the [[Falkland Islands]] on behalf of Britain on the grounds of prior discovery, and in so doing was [[Falkland Crisis (1770)|nearly the cause of a war]] between [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Spain]], both countries having armed fleets ready to contest the  sovereignty of the barren islands. Later Byron visited islands of [[Tuamotus]], [[Tokelau]] and [[Nikunau]] in the [[Gilbert Islands]], putting them on European maps for the first time (in European circles, Nikunau went by the name \"Byron Island\" for over 100 years); and visited [[Tinian]] in the [[Northern Marianas Islands]].\n\n==Second circumnavigation==\n[[File:Memorial to Samuel Wallis in Truro Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Memorial to Samuel Wallis and the crew in [[Truro Cathedral]]]]\n''Dolphin'' circumnavigated the world for a second time, under the command of [[Samuel Wallis]]. Her [[master's mate]], [[John Gore (seaman)|John Gore]], was among a number of the crew from Byron's circumnavigation who crewed with Wallis. The master on this voyage, George Robertson, subsequently wrote a book ''The discovery of Tahiti; a journal of the second voyage of H.M.S. Dolphin round the world under the command of Captain Wallis, R.N., in the years 1766, 1767, and 1768, written by her master''.<ref>[http://www.alibris.com/search/books/author/Robertson,%20George,%20master%20of%20H.%20M.%20S.%20Dolphin Alibris]</ref> ''Dolphin'' sailed in 1766 in the company of HMS ''Swallow'', under the command of [[Philip Carteret]], who had served on Byron's circumnavigation.\n\n''Dolphin'' dropped anchor at the peninsula of Tahiti Iti (\"small Tahiti\", aka Taiarapu) on 17 June 1767 but quickly left to find a better anchorage. Wallis chose [[Matavai Bay]] on 23 June. Although the Spanish had visited the [[Marquesas Islands]] in 1595, some 170 years earlier, Wallis officially took possession of Otaheiti, which he named \"King George III Island\". (About a year later, French navigator [[Louis-Antoine de Bougainville]] landed at Hitiaa on the opposite side of Tahiti and unaware of Wallis's earlier visit, claimed it for the King of France.)\n\nEarly on a large canoe approached ''Dolphin'' and at a signal its occupants launched a storm of stones at the British, who replied with [[grapeshot]]. ''Dolphin's'' gunnery cut the canoe in two, killing most of its occupants. Wallis then sent his carpenters ashore to cut the eighty-some canoes there in half. Eventually, friendly relations were established between the British sailors and the locals. The relationships became particularly friendly when the sailors discovered that the women were eager to exchange sex for iron. This trade became so extensive that the loss of nails started to threaten ''Dolphin's'' physical integrity.<ref>Couper (2009), pp. 64\u201365, 69.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[European and American voyages of scientific exploration]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite book |title =From Sailors and Traders: A Maritime History of the Pacific Peoples | first =Alistair | last =Couper | year =2009 | publisher =University of Hawai'i Press | isbn =\n9781441619884}}\n* {{cite book | last = Winfield| first = Rif|title = British Warships of the Age of Sail 1714\u20131792: Design, Construction, Careers and Fates | publisher =  Seaforth| year = 2007|isbn=9781844157006}}\n* {{cite book |title =The Exploration of the Pacific | first =J.C. | last =Beaglehole |author-link=John Cawte Beaglehole| year =1966 | publisher =Adam & Charles Black, London | oclc = 422331302}}\n* {{cite web | title=HMS ''Dolphin'' | work=Ships of the World: an Historical Encyclopaedia | url=http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/ships/html/sh_027600_hmsdolphin.htm | accessdate=15 August 2005 }}\nOfficer on Board the Said Ship.
