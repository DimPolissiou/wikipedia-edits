Its range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the [[Andes]]. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build and uniform coloration that differs significantly from other [[Neotropics|neotropical]] cats (such as the small, spotted cats in the [[genus]] ''[[Leopardus]]'') in its external appearance. In fact, the jaguarundi shows several features seen in [[mustelid]]s (such as [[otter]]s and [[weasel]]s)\u2014it has an elongated body with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short [[snout]] and a long tail. Around twice as large as the [[domestic cat]], the jaguarundi stands {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|3.5|\u2013|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are two color [[Morph (zoology)|morph]]s\u2014gray and red.\n\nSecretive and alert, the jaguarundi is typically solitary or forms pairs in the wild, though captive individuals are gregarious. Unlike other [[Sympatry|sympatric]] cats such as [[ocelot]]s, the jaguarundi is more active during the day and hunts mainly during daytime and evening hours. Individuals live in large [[home range]]s, and are sparsely distributed within a region. The jaguarundi is an efficient climber, but typically prefers hunting on ground. It feeds on various kinds of prey, especially ground-feeding birds, reptiles, [[rodent]]s and small mammals. Mating occurs throughout the year, with peaks at different times of the year across the range. After a [[gestation period]] of 70 to 75 days, a litter of one to four kittens is born. Lifespan of up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.\n\nJaguarundis occur in a broad array of closed as well as open habitats ranging from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. While they are fairly common in Brazil, Peru and Venezuela, jaguarundis may have gone [[extinct]] in the US. The [[IUCN]] lists the jaguarundi as [[Least Concern]], but populations are in decline in many parts of its range due to loss and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] of their habitat and persecution for killing poultry.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe common name \"jaguarundi\" ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0292|\u00e6|\u0261|w|\u0259|\u02c8|r|\u028c|n|d|i}}) comes from the [[Guarani language|Old Guarani]] word ''yaguarundi'', similar to the [[Old Tupi]] word ''yawaum'di''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferreira |first=A.B.H. |year=1986 |title=Novo Dicion\u00e1rio da L\u00edngua Portuguesa|language=Portuguese |trans-title=New Dictionary of the Portuguese Language |edition=2nd|place=Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Nova Fronteira |page=980}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|jaguarundi|accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> In some [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking countries, the jaguarundi is also called ''gato colorado'', ''gato moro'', ''le\u00f3n brenero'', ''leoncillo'' and ''tigrillo''.<ref name=iucn/> It is also called ''eyra'', ''gato-mourisco'', ''gato-preto'', ''gato-vermelho'' and ''maracaj\u00e1-preto'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Miranda |first1=E.E. |last2=Gambarini |first2=A. |title=Natureza, Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e Cultura: Ensaio sobre a Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Homem com a Natureza no Brasil |trans-title=Nature, Conservation and Culture: Essay on the Relationship between Man and Nature in Brazil |date=2003 |publisher=Metalivros |location=S\u00e3o Paulo |isbn=9788585371470 |page=113 |language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Nowell |editor1-first=K. |editor2-last=Jackson |editor2-first=P. |editor3-last=IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group |title=Wild Cats: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan |date=1996 |publisher=IUCN |location=Gland |isbn=978-2-8317-0045-8 |page=146}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Felis yagouarundi'' was the [[scientific name]] used by [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] in 1803 who described two [[zoological specimen|specimen]]s from Central America, including one from [[French Guiana]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, \u00c9. |authorlink=\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire |year=1803 |title=Catalogue des Mammif\u00e8res du Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |trans-title=Catalogue of Mammals of the National Museum of Natural History| language=French |location=Paris |publisher=Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |page=124 |chapter=Le chat yagouarundi.

Estrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, a litter of one to four kittens is born in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover.

[[felidae|cat]] native to the Americas. Its range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the [[Andes]]. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build and uniform coloration that differs significantly from other [[Neotropics|neotropical]] cats (such as the small, spotted cats in the [[genus]] ''[[Leopardus]]'') in its external appearance. In fact, the jaguarundi shows several features seen in [[mustelid]]s (such as [[otter]]s and [[weasel]]s)\u2014it has an elongated body with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short [[snout]] and a long tail. Around twice as large as the [[domestic cat]], the jaguarundi stands {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|3.5|\u2013|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are two color [[Morph (zoology)|morph]]s\u2014gray and red.\n\nSecretive and alert, the jaguarundi is typically solitary or forms pairs in the wild, though captive individuals are gregarious. Unlike other [[Sympatry|sympatric]] cats such as [[ocelot]]s, the jaguarundi is more active during the day and hunts mainly during daytime and evening hours. Individuals live in large [[home range]]s, and are sparsely distributed within a region. The jaguarundi is an efficient climber, but typically prefers hunting on ground. It feeds on various kinds of prey, especially ground-feeding birds, reptiles, [[rodent]]s and small mammals. Mating occurs throughout the year, with peaks at different times of the year across the range. After a [[gestation period]] of 70 to 75 days, a litter of one to four kittens is born.

Social behavior such as grooming, growling and sniffing has been recorded. The jaguarundi has a broad vocal repertoire; 13 different calls have been recorded including chattering, purring, screaming, a 'wah-wah' call, whistling, yapping and a peculiar bird-like chirp.

Estrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, a litter of one to four kittens is born in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/> The mother starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old, who simply play with it till the mother ingests it; kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks. Jaguarundis become sexually mature at one to three years of age. Lifespan up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=Nowak/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe jaguarundi inhabits a wide variety of habitats\u2014from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s.

Issue #1 was released in July 2006.\n\n==Overview==\nSome two hundred years from now, the MAPPO Corporation, headed by the [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] and [[Narcissistic personality disorder|megalomaniacal]] [[Japan]]ese scientist, Dr Kazushi Nikken, breeds human/animal hybrids in a secure, top secret facility somewhere in North Africa. The Hybrids are composed of numerous African animal species including [[Warthog]]s, [[Elephant]]s, [[Camel]]s, [[Zebra]]s, [[Rhinoceros|Rhinos]], [[hippopotamus|Hippos]], [[Giraffe]]s, [[Hyena]]s and [[Crocodile]]s. The process involves implanting embryos into the wombs of kidnapped local women who are disposed of after giving birth. Each child is branded after birth marking them as the property of MAPPO.\n\nThese Elephantmen are trained from birth to be soldiers and killers and are indoctrinated with an Orwellian mindset to think of themselves as property of the MAPPO Corporation and to deny any concept of free thought.\n\nUpon discovering these experiments, the United Nations send in an army to storm MAPPO's secret base. While their mission has not been elaborated at this stage it seems to be a combination of liberating the Elephantmen, investigating the attacks on the local populace and ending the development of MAPPO's illegal army.\n\nMAPPO turns the Elephantmen on the U.N. troops, and horrendous casualties are inflicted on both sides. Ultimately, the U.N. succeed in subduing the Elephantmen and the MAPPO Personnel are arrested. The Elephantmen are rehabilitated and released to establish their own lives in the outside world where they are generally treated with distrust and horror from humans. Many of the Elephantmen were assigned jobs by the government.\n\nLiving with the humans has proven to be incredibly difficult for the Elephantmen. The war in which they fought had great consequences as people from both sides (Elephantmen included) lost many loved ones.\nNot all of those who survived retained their sanity, in fact some became active hunters who tracked down Elephantmen, and then executed them. The series shows that the characters are haunted by memories that are still raw, with some people being driven to insanity due to being unable to let go of the past. It is evident that the Elephantmen themselves show some level of regret towards what they did during the conflict. It is also evident that crimes such as the ivory trade are seen as a good excuse to commit murder, and that even the Elephantmen themselves are involved with the seedy underworld and drug abuse. Women who befriend, and become romantically involved with the Elephantmen are treated as outsiders, frowned upon, yet some have nightmares about their offspring and the chances of survival during childbirth. At this time in the series the species do not accept each other.\n\nThe series as a whole is similar to the book ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]''. Thus it also bears similarities to [[Blade Runner|the film adaptation of the aforementioned book.]]\n\n==Publication history==\nThe ''Elephantmen'' series is a spin-off from the series ''[[Hip Flask (comics)|Hip Flask]]'', set in the same universe and expanding on details of various minor characters from that series. ''Elephantmen: War Toys'' is a three-issue mini-series prequel.\n\n==Characters==\n===Elephantmen===\n* '''Hieronymus (Hip) Flask''' - [[Hippopotamus]] Hybrid Flask #7A. Hip Flask's tattoo is distorted by a scar so that \"Hippopotamus Hybrid Flask #7A\" instead reads just \"Hip Flask #7A\", hence his name. A product of the Human/Animal hybrid research of The MAPPO Corporation, Hip Flask is a walking, talking hippopotamus who works as an advisor for the Information Agency, a government body tasked with monitoring data and information as an aid to [[Police|law enforcement]]. He is partnered by a beautiful young woman named Vanity Case who seems to have romantic feelings towards him (much to Hip's embarrassment), and befriends a cab-driver Miki with whom he slowly becomes mutually attracted to. Despite some bumps along the way, Hip and Miki form a true romance, which he deeply appreciates and cherishes but it still scares him what being with him could do to Miki. Despite his traumatic childhood Hip Flask is shown to be a calm, kind and friendly individual, unlike many of the other Elephantmen who display a great deal of bitterness. Hip Flask was possibly the only Elephantman who dared to ask questions during his childhood education, an act for which he was placed in [[solitary confinement]]. It is eventually revealed that Hip is Sahara's younger half-brother because he was born from her mother.\n* '''Ebenezer Hide''' - [[Elephant]] Hybrid. \"Ebony\" works in the Information Agency with Hip Flask. Overcome with depression, he relies heavily on drugs to relive his prime, both mentally and sexually. Possibly as a result of PTSD and the drugs he uses, Ebony has vivid waking dreams of warrior fantasies, his favorite comic being ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]''. He lost his legs due to serious injuries and is now confined to a hovering wheelchair. \n* '''Tusk''' - [[Warthog]] Hybrid. He was driven to [[insanity]] due to MAPPO's extensive chemical experimentation to see if the Elephantmen could withstand poisons and harsh chemicals. His body did withstand it but his mind could not. After the Elephantmen were \"liberated\" Tusk resided at the Elephantmen hospital in downtown [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] until he escaped by mistake. He wandered near some docks and came across a senile old lady, looking for her \"Joe\", and saved her from falling off the pier. The old woman offered him food and shelter, to Tusk's appreciation for her kindness despite his maddened mind. Unfortunately, Trench and three cops mistook Tusk for holding the woman hostage and killed him. Tusk was given a funeral service that was attended by Hip, Ebony, Miki, and Sahara. \n* '''Casbah Joe''' - [[Camel]] Hybrid. Runs a floating restaurant/nightclub called the Eye of the Needle.\n* '''Obadiah Horn''' - [[Rhinoceros]] Hybrid. Horn has climbed the ranks of society and has become a successful Los Angeles businessman. He is married to Sahara. He is aggressive and almost unforgiving, but deep down a good person. Unless his wife is present, there is no other person who can reason with him. Sahara succeeds in birthing a son for Obadiah but the baby is kidnapped by Sahara's father, Serengheti. In a fit of rage, Obadiah shoots Gabbatha dead, shocking Sahara that she is reluctant to get close to him again. Obadiah is deeply ashamed for his murder of Gabbatha and his wife's reaction and he dedicates to making amends. \n* '''Elijah Delaney''' - [[Crocodile]] Hybrid. No known characteristics.\n* '''Trench''' - [[Zebra]] Hybrid. He is a Lieutenant in the [[Los Angeles Police Department]]. When he fought in a war while still under MAPPO's control, Trench lost his eye to a piece of shrapnel, and he stuck a burning stick into the wound to cauterize it. His experiences and the horrors he has witnessed have caused him to see the world in black-and-white, making him appear ruthless and unfeeling in some cases he works on, and having no qualms with collateral damage in his work as a police officer. However, after Promethean's attempted coup using their Hyena Transgenics, many of which Trench killed (and enjoyed doing it) he becomes so disturbed by his enjoyment of killing that he decides to go out drinking while planning to turn in his badge the next day. However, he is slipped a cocktail of hallucinogenics from a woman named Lindy Lund, the twin sister of a drug-dealer Trench killed, and very nearly dies in the car-chase that ensued. In the end, Lund is arrested and Trench survives his near-death experience.\n* '''Jeremiah Granger''' - [[Giraffe]] Hybrid. He is a tailor and a friend of Hip Flask, Ebony Hide, and even Sahara who visits him whenever she goes out anonymously. He is an educated and kind person, having extensive knowledge of tea and textiles, and among the few people Sahara confides in.\n* '''Gabbatha''' - [[Elephant]] Hybrid. Gabbatha is an Elephantman [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] who advocates life, acceptance, tolerance, and forgiveness, having become quite famous for his practice and even gained a following of like-minded human individuals. He was to be the officiator of Obadiah Horn and Sahara's wedding (unaware that Sahara had left her double Panya in her place). When the real Sahara came, revealing her and Obadiah's child, she entrusted her son to Gabbatha while she and their friends dealt with her murderous father Serengheti. Unfortunately, Panya took the baby from Gabbatha's arms and offered him to Serenghetti, only to be shot dead. In a fit of rage and grief, Obadiah impulsively shot and killed Gabbatha. His death was a tragic loss to humans and Elephantmen alike and it caused a strain in Obadiah and Sahara's relationship.\n* '''Demetrios''' - [[Mammoth]] Hybrid. Demetrios is a transgenic but was not created by MAPPO. He was created by a female Russian Scientist, who was exiled for thought crimes. She stumbled upon the remains of a mammoth. She took DNA samples, implanted them with her own eggs and carried her creation in her own womb. She had to give premature birth to her child, otherwise he would have killed her had she carried him to full term. She raised and loved Demetrios and taught him survival, as well as to speak many languages. Alas, when Demetrios was near-fully grown, men came, desiring his mother's research secrets and him, so they could create an army of transgenics using his mother's work. In the conflict that followed, Demetrios' mother was killed and he alone survived. He journeyed north to avoid people but was hunted relentlessly until finally he was captured by hunters and brought back to the city by cargo ship. Demetrios managed to get loose and killed the hunters but was dealt too many wounds in turn. Miki found Demetrios and he told her his story before he died, but thanked her for her compassion.\n* '''The Mops''' - [[Hyena]] Hybrids. The Mops was the nickname of the Hyena Hybrid Elephantmen MAPPO created to serve as the \"cleanup crew\" during the war. Their job was to kill any survivors without mercy or exception. When MAPPO was brought down, the Hyenas were deemed too savage and dangerous to be rehabilitated and were all put down. The remnants of MAPPO known as Promethean genetically engineered a new army of Hyena Elephantmen to purge the city of the older Elephantmen but Obadiah Horn and his android servant Mr. Purchase managed to detonate the explosives implanted into the Hyenas' skulls, stopping their rampage.\n* '''The Tigers''' - [[Tiger]] Hybrids. The Tigers were transgenics created by [[China]] to serve in their military as their counter-forces against MAPPO's Elephantmen soldiers. They were efficient but once the war concluded, they were all simultaneously executed via remotely-detonated explosives implanted into their skulls, because China's already massive population could not afford to let them live.\n\n===Humans===\n* '''Bianca \"Vanity\" Case''' - Hip Flask's new junior-partner. She had a crush on him but after Hip and Miki became a couple, Vanity appeared to shift her infatuation to Ebony. \n* '''Joshua Serengheti''' - The main antagonist in the story. He despises the Elephantmen and wants them all killed. He is the father of Sahara and is involved with the ivory industry. He detests the Elephantmen because his job in the industry became less profitable due to the individual species of the elephantmen no longer being endangered. Essentially he hated the MAPPO corporation for somewhat saving endangered animals. Serengheti spent most of his life killing and grew up to be as cruel and ruthless as the men who had forced him to kill. He even sold the mother of his daughter to MAPPO for money, and came to despise Sahara simply for being a girl and named her after the most barren desert on the planet, subjecting her to physical and emotional abuse, as well as allowing some of his men to rape her. After she escaped him, Serengheti has been looking for her, not because he has any affection for her of any kind but rather he sees her as his property. He sought out Sahara to kill her rather than allow her to wed Obadiah Horn but instead kidnaps her son.\n* '''Herman Strumm''' - Mouth Almighty Herman Strumm and his delectable sidekick, Rabbi, entertain satellite radio listeners via Dogstar Radio. He was visited by Elijah Delaney for an interview.\n* '''Sahara''' - The wife of Obadiah Horn. She acts as the voice of reason to the Elephantmen, and she is seen by all as their queen, capable of reasoning with Obadiah. She is the very reason why mankind is forced to coexist with the Elephantmen. Her father, Serengheti, abused her physically and emotionally for most of her childhood (and was sexually assaulted by his men and underwent a painful African form of circumcision) until she managed to get away from him. She somehow discovered Hip Flask to be her younger half-brother since he was born from her mother. She gives birth to Obadiah Horn's son (the baby born appearing entirely human) but her child winds up getting kidnapped by her father Serengheti. She becomes distant to her husband after he impulsively murders Gabbatha in a fit of [[Rage (emotion)|rage]], but after reminiscing a moment from her childhood where her mother gave her guidance, Sahara begins mending the bond with her husband. \n* '''Savannah''' - A little girl that is interested in the Elephantmen, Ebony in particular, much to the disgust and concern of her mother.\n* '''Miki''' - She is a cab driver in Santa Monica.  Has a ''huge'' crush on Hip, which came to be mutual despite her mere associating with Hip causing much strife and conflict between Miki and her mother (that came to an end when Miki's mother recognized Hip as the one who spared her and her family during a war when she was younger). After discovering she was pregnant (after having been exposed to a deadly virus) she gave up the fetus for research, Hip accompanying her for moral support, to her deep appreciation. Their relationship deepens into true and sincere love, this leading to Miki refusing to be dissuaded by any naysayers about her relationship with Hip, and she is able to lift Hip's spirits whenever he is depressed and convinces him whatever comes their way she will be with him.\n* '''Janis Blackthorne''' - A former UN soldier and a member of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]]. She was kicked out by her parents when she was fifteen for unknown reasons. After spending some years as a drug dealer, she got herself cleaned up and became a UN soldier. During that time she meet and married a man called James, eventually they fought in the war against the Elephantmen and during a battle James was killed. Blaming herself for his death Janis developed a hatred towards the Elephantmen, however she often worked alongside Hip and Ebony on several occasions and even gain respect for them. She was later killed by Yvette after preventing her from killing Granger. \n* '''Panya''' - Panya is an employee of Joe, working as a dancer in the Eye of the Needle, where she was spotted by Sahara and Obadiah Horn. Noting how they looked so much alike, Sahara approached Panya and hired her to switches places with her every now and then so that Sahara could interact with the public anonymously while Panya distracts the world that is constantly watching Sahara, including Obadiah Horn. Panya soon grows to like being Sahara that she even tries to take her place permanently. In the end, she is murdered by Serengheti. However, Panya managed to arrange for her mother to be provided for by sending a White-Gold Elephant statuette to Vlasco and a letter telling him if he'd ever had a heart he'd sell the Elephant and give the money to her mother, as well as some parting words. \n* '''Yvette''' - Yvette was a soldier who fought the Elephantmen when they were MAPPO's soldiers. She earned a bloody reputation of carving her name onto the heads of every Elephantman she killed, driven by her [[hatred]] of them for killing her family and taking everything she had from her, causing her to swear to kill every last Elephantman. She resurfaced years after the war in [[France]] and became a serial killer, hunting and killing all Elephantmen she could find regardless of who they were, and writing the words 'No Mercy' on walls or their bodies with their blood, all the while wearing the [[skull]] of Tusk. Her killing spree comes to an end after she fails to kill Obadiah Horn. In the confrontation, Sahara tries to talk Yvette into letting go of her hatred and emotional baggage, but Yvette, full of [[Resentment|bitterness]], hatred, and [[grief]], cannot let it go and feeling there is no future for someone like her she [[Suicide|takes her own life]]. \n* '''Dr. Nikken''' - Dr. Nikken of the MAPPO corporation used kidnapped women as incubators to bring to term several experimental human/animal hybrids. He originally intended them to be used as \"weapons of mass destruction\", despite soldiers being incapable of qualifying for the term. This is likely an oversight on the part of the comic writer. Nikken has a [[god complex]] and no morals of any kind, not having a sliver of guilt or regret of the suffering he caused and the lives he'd destroyed in his experiments.\n* '''La Mantia''' - La Mantia is a government agent who oversees the Elephantmen's activities. But really, he is a part of a conspiracy called Promethean that is composed of remnants of MAPPO who wish to rise in power again using the Elephantmen, old and new. He is intelligent, ruthless, and ambitious, as he attempted to destroy Obadiah Horn and Sahara's unborn child but instead destroyed a decoy fetus that Panya had been carrying, mistaking her for the real Sahara. He and his fellow Prometheans plan an extermination of the old Elephantmen using their recently developed Transgenic Hyena Soldiers, and he personally approaches Horn to offer him leadership of the army under the thumb of the Prometheans. He arrogantly lets his guard down, which provides Horn the perfect opportunity to kill him, and he does by crushing La Mantia's head and his corpse is fed upon by his own Hyena soldiers. \n* '''Agathe''' - Agathe was a young girl who met Yvette and was inspired to fight the Elephantment for idealistic reasons. However, because of her age, Yvette did not allow her to come with her after she recovered from Agathe's mother's hospitality. Alas, the war involving the Elephantmen soon found Agathe's family and her mother and brothers were killed. She was approached by Trench who spared her life and told her to run to France. Agathe instead took up a dead soldier's gun and started killing Elephantmen herself. She was found by human resistance fighters who took her in and told her of their plan to kill the Elephantmen invading their country. However an Elephantman soldier found their hideout and gunned them down, missing only Agathe who managed to remain hidden. Filled with rage, grief and emboldened by everything she lost, Agathe went forward with her allies' plan, leaving only a message intended for the creators of the Elephantmen. She swore that even if their monsters won their land would never be their prize; she insured this by using an explosive to detonate a nuclear power plant. At the cost of her own life, Agathe single-handedly caused more deaths in the war than anyone, both Elephantman and human, and her country became a radiated wasteland.\n* '''Carlos Vlasco''' - Vlasco was the head of MAPPO security and once under Nikken's payroll. He took sadistic enjoyment of physically and mentally abusing all the Elephantmen MAPPO created and was allowed to in order to produce obedient and hard soldiers. When MAPPO was brought down, Vlasco was attacked by Ebony, who crushed his legs and stabbed him through the chest with his tusk. Miraculously, Vlasco survived and escaped prosecution by the aid of Joe. He used criminal connections to get medical treatment and new [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] legs, but was soon diagnosed with [[cancer]]. He became a [[Contract killing|hitman]] known as the Silencer and used advanced cloaking to become invisible. He killed many Elephantmen and harvested their cells to produce treatments for his cancer to prevent his death, and has killed hundreds of people in his career as a hitman, both Elephantmen and humans. He disposed of many of his victims' bodies by placing them in weighed [[body bag]]s and dumping them into a river canal. His dumping site was eventually discovered and he became known also as the River Killer.\n\n==Collected editions==\n\n* Elephantmen, vol. 0: Armed Forces- Collects Elephantmen: War Toys #1-3 Elephantmen: Yvette, Elephantmen #34-35.

Issue #1 was released in July 2006.\n\n==Overview==\nSome two hundred years from now, the MAPPO Corporation, headed by the [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] and [[Narcissistic personality disorder|megalomaniacal]] [[Japan]]ese scientist, Dr Kazushi Nikken, breeds human/animal hybrids in a secure, top secret facility somewhere in North Africa. The Hybrids are composed of numerous African animal species including [[Warthog]]s, [[Elephant]]s, [[Camel]]s, [[Zebra]]s, [[Rhinoceros|Rhinos]], [[hippopotamus|Hippos]], [[Giraffe]]s, [[Hyena]]s and [[Crocodile]]s. The process involves implanting embryos into the wombs of kidnapped local women who are disposed of after giving birth. Each child is branded after birth marking them as the property of MAPPO.\n\nThese Elephantmen are trained from birth to be soldiers and killers and are indoctrinated with an Orwellian mindset to think of themselves as property of the MAPPO Corporation and to deny any concept of free thought.\n\nUpon discovering these experiments, the United Nations send in an army to storm MAPPO's secret base. While their mission has not been elaborated at this stage it seems to be a combination of liberating the Elephantmen, investigating the attacks on the local populace and ending the development of MAPPO's illegal army.\n\nMAPPO turns the Elephantmen on the U.N. troops, and horrendous casualties are inflicted on both sides. Ultimately, the U.N. succeed in subduing the Elephantmen and the MAPPO Personnel are arrested. The Elephantmen are rehabilitated and released to establish their own lives in the outside world where they are generally treated with distrust and horror from humans. Many of the Elephantmen were assigned jobs by the government.\n\nLiving with the humans has proven to be incredibly difficult for the Elephantmen. The war in which they fought had great consequences as people from both sides (Elephantmen included) lost many loved ones.\nNot all of those who survived retained their sanity, in fact some became active hunters who tracked down Elephantmen, and then executed them. The series shows that the characters are haunted by memories that are still raw, with some people being driven to insanity due to being unable to let go of the past. It is evident that the Elephantmen themselves show some level of regret towards what they did during the conflict. It is also evident that crimes such as the ivory trade are seen as a good excuse to commit murder, and that even the Elephantmen themselves are involved with the seedy underworld and drug abuse. Women who befriend, and become romantically involved with the Elephantmen are treated as outsiders, frowned upon, yet some have nightmares about their offspring and the chances of survival during childbirth. At this time in the series the species do not accept each other.\n\nThe series as a whole is similar to the book ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]''. Thus it also bears similarities to [[Blade Runner|the film adaptation of the aforementioned book.]]\n\n==Publication history==\nThe ''Elephantmen'' series is a spin-off from the series ''[[Hip Flask (comics)|Hip Flask]]'', set in the same universe and expanding on details of various minor characters from that series. ''Elephantmen: War Toys'' is a three-issue mini-series prequel.\n\n==Characters==\n===Elephantmen===\n* '''Hieronymus (Hip) Flask''' - [[Hippopotamus]] Hybrid Flask #7A. Hip Flask's tattoo is distorted by a scar so that \"Hippopotamus Hybrid Flask #7A\" instead reads just \"Hip Flask #7A\", hence his name. A product of the Human/Animal hybrid research of The MAPPO Corporation, Hip Flask is a walking, talking hippopotamus who works as an advisor for the Information Agency, a government body tasked with monitoring data and information as an aid to [[Police|law enforcement]]. He is partnered by a beautiful young woman named Vanity Case who seems to have romantic feelings towards him (much to Hip's embarrassment), and befriends a cab-driver Miki with whom he slowly becomes mutually attracted to. Despite some bumps along the way, Hip and Miki form a true romance, which he deeply appreciates and cherishes but it still scares him what being with him could do to Miki. Despite his traumatic childhood Hip Flask is shown to be a calm, kind and friendly individual, unlike many of the other Elephantmen who display a great deal of bitterness. Hip Flask was possibly the only Elephantman who dared to ask questions during his childhood education, an act for which he was placed in [[solitary confinement]]. It is eventually revealed that Hip is Sahara's younger half-brother because he was born from her mother.\n* '''Ebenezer Hide''' - [[Elephant]] Hybrid. \"Ebony\" works in the Information Agency with Hip Flask. Overcome with depression, he relies heavily on drugs to relive his prime, both mentally and sexually. Possibly as a result of PTSD and the drugs he uses, Ebony has vivid waking dreams of warrior fantasies, his favorite comic being ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]''. He lost his legs due to serious injuries and is now confined to a hovering wheelchair. \n* '''Tusk''' - [[Warthog]] Hybrid. He was driven to [[insanity]] due to MAPPO's extensive chemical experimentation to see if the Elephantmen could withstand poisons and harsh chemicals. His body did withstand it but his mind could not. After the Elephantmen were \"liberated\" Tusk resided at the Elephantmen hospital in downtown [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] until he escaped by mistake. He wandered near some docks and came across a senile old lady, looking for her \"Joe\", and saved her from falling off the pier. The old woman offered him food and shelter, to Tusk's appreciation for her kindness despite his maddened mind. Unfortunately, Trench and three cops mistook Tusk for holding the woman hostage and killed him. Tusk was given a funeral service that was attended by Hip, Ebony, Miki, and Sahara. \n* '''Casbah Joe''' - [[Camel]] Hybrid. Runs a floating restaurant/nightclub called the Eye of the Needle.\n* '''Obadiah Horn''' - [[Rhinoceros]] Hybrid. Horn has climbed the ranks of society and has become a successful Los Angeles businessman. He is married to Sahara. He is aggressive and almost unforgiving, but deep down a good person. Unless his wife is present, there is no other person who can reason with him. Sahara succeeds in birthing a son for Obadiah but the baby is kidnapped by Sahara's father, Serengheti. In a fit of rage, Obadiah shoots Gabbatha dead, shocking Sahara that she is reluctant to get close to him again. Obadiah is deeply ashamed for his murder of Gabbatha and his wife's reaction and he dedicates to making amends. \n* '''Elijah Delaney''' - [[Crocodile]] Hybrid. No known characteristics.\n* '''Trench''' - [[Zebra]] Hybrid. He is a Lieutenant in the [[Los Angeles Police Department]]. When he fought in a war while still under MAPPO's control, Trench lost his eye to a piece of shrapnel, and he stuck a burning stick into the wound to cauterize it. His experiences and the horrors he's witnessed have caused him to see the world in black-and-white, making him appear ruthless and unfeeling in some cases he works on, and having no qualms with collateral damage in his work as a police officer. However, after Promethean's attempted coup using their Hyena Transgenics, many of which Trench killed (and enjoyed doing it) he becomes so disturbed by his enjoyment of killing that he decides to go out drinking while planning to turn in his badge the next day. However, he is slipped a cocktail of hallucinogenics from a woman named Lindy Lund, the twin sister of a drug-dealer Trench killed, and very nearly dies in the car-chase that ensued. In the end, Lund is arrested and Trench survives his near-death experience. \n* '''Jeremiah Granger''' - [[Giraffe]] Hybrid. He is a tailor and a friend of Hip Flask, Ebony Hide, and even Sahara who visits him whenever she goes out anonymously. He is an educated and kind person, having extensive knowledge of tea and textiles, and among the few people Sahara confides in.\n* '''Gabbatha''' - [[Elephant]] Hybrid. Gabbatha is an Elephantman [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] who advocates life, acceptance, tolerance, and forgiveness, having become quite famous for his practice and even gained a following of like-minded human individuals. He was to be the officiator of Obadiah Horn and Sahara's wedding (unaware that Sahara had left her double Panya in her place). When the real Sahara came, revealing her and Obadiah's child, she entrusted her son to Gabbatha while she and their friends dealt with her murderous father Serengheti. Unfortunately, Panya took the baby from Gabbatha's arms and offered him to Serenghetti, only to be shot dead. In a fit of rage and grief, Obadiah impulsively shot and killed Gabbatha. His death was a tragic loss to humans and Elephantmen alike and it caused a strain in Obadiah and Sahara's relationship.\n* '''Demetrios''' - [[Mammoth]] Hybrid. Demetrios is a transgenic but was not created by MAPPO. He was created by a female Russian Scientist, who was exiled for thought crimes. She stumbled upon the remains of a mammoth. She took DNA samples, implanted them with her own eggs and carried her creation in her own womb. She had to give premature birth to her child, otherwise he would have killed her had she carried him to full term. She raised and loved Demetrios and taught him survival, as well as to speak many languages. Alas, when Demetrios was near-fully grown, men came, desiring his mother's research secrets and him, so they could create an army of transgenics using his mother's work. In the conflict that followed, Demetrios' mother was killed and he alone survived. He journeyed north to avoid people but was hunted relentlessly until finally he was captured by hunters and brought back to the city by cargo ship. Demetrios managed to get loose and killed the hunters but was dealt too many wounds in turn. Miki found Demetrios and he told her his story before he died, but thanked her for her compassion.\n* '''The Mops''' - [[Hyena]] Hybrids. The Mops was the nickname of the Hyena Hybrid Elephantmen MAPPO created to serve as the \"cleanup crew\" during the war. Their job was to kill any survivors without mercy or exception. When MAPPO was brought down, the Hyenas were deemed too savage and dangerous to be rehabilitated and were all put down. The remnants of MAPPO known as Promethean genetically engineered a new army of Hyena Elephantmen to purge the city of the older Elephantmen but Obadiah Horn and his android servant Mr. Purchase managed to detonate the explosives implanted into the Hyenas' skulls, stopping their rampage.\n* '''The Tigers''' - [[Tiger]] Hybrids. The Tigers were transgenics created by [[China]] to serve in their military as their counter-forces against MAPPO's Elephantmen soldiers. They were efficient but once the war concluded, they were all simultaneously executed via remotely-detonated explosives implanted into their skulls, because China's already massive population could not afford to let them live.\n\n===Humans===\n* '''Bianca \"Vanity\" Case''' - Hip Flask's new junior-partner. She had a crush on him but after Hip and Miki became a couple, Vanity appeared to shift her infatuation to Ebony. \n* '''Joshua Serengheti''' - The main antagonist in the story. He despises the Elephantmen and wants them all killed. He is the father of Sahara and is involved with the ivory industry. He detests the Elephantmen because his job in the industry became less profitable due to the individual species of the elephantmen no longer being endangered. Essentially he hated the MAPPO corporation for somewhat saving endangered animals. Serengheti spent most of his life killing and grew up to be as cruel and ruthless as the men who'd forced him to kill. He even sold the mother of his daughter to MAPPO for money, and came to despise Sahara simply for being a girl and named her after the most barren desert on the planet, subjecting her to physical and emotional abuse, as well as allowing some of his men to rape her. After she escaped him, Serengheti has been looking for her, not because he has any affection for her of any kind but rather he sees her as his property. He sought out Sahara to kill her rather than allow her to wed Obadiah Horn but instead kidnaps her son.\n* '''Herman Strumm''' - Mouth Almighty Herman Strumm and his delectable sidekick, Rabbi, entertain satellite radio listeners via Dogstar Radio. He was visited by Elijah Delaney for an interview.\n* '''Sahara''' - The wife of Obadiah Horn. She acts as the voice of reason to the Elephantmen, and she is seen by all as their queen, capable of reasoning with Obadiah. She is the very reason why mankind is forced to coexist with the Elephantmen. Her father, Serengheti, abused her physically and emotionally for most of her childhood (and was sexually assaulted by his men and underwent a painful African form of circumcision) until she managed to get away from him. She somehow discovered Hip Flask to be her younger half-brother since he was born from her mother. She gives birth to Obadiah Horn's son (the baby born appearing entirely human) but her child winds up getting kidnapped by her father Serengheti. She becomes distant to her husband after he impulsively murders Gabbatha in a fit of [[Rage (emotion)|rage]], but after reminiscing a moment from her childhood where her mother gave her guidance, Sahara begins mending the bond with her husband. \n* '''Savannah''' - A little girl that is interested in the Elephantmen, Ebony in particular, much to the disgust and concern of her mother.\n* '''Miki''' - She is a cab driver in Santa Monica.  Has a ''huge'' crush on Hip, which came to be mutual despite her mere associating with Hip causing much strife and conflict between Miki and her mother (that came to an end when Miki's mother recognized Hip as the one who spared her and her family during a war when she was younger). After discovering she was pregnant (after having been exposed to a deadly virus) she gave up the fetus for research, Hip accompanying her for moral support, to her deep appreciation. Their relationship deepens into true and sincere love, this leading to Miki refusing to be dissuaded by any naysayers about her relationship with Hip, and she is able to lift Hip's spirits whenever he's depressed and convinces him whatever comes their way she will be with him. \n* '''Janis Blackthorne''' - A former UN soldier and a member of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]]. She was kicked out by her parents when she was fifteen for unknown reasons. After spending some years as a drug dealer, she got herself cleaned up and became a UN soldier. During that time she meet and married a man called James, eventually they fought in the war against the Elephantmen and during a battle James was killed. Blaming herself for his death Janis developed a hatred towards the Elephantmen, however she often worked alongside Hip and Ebony on several occasions and even gain respect for them. She was later killed by Yvette after preventing her from killing Granger. \n* '''Panya''' - Panya is an employee of Joe, working as a dancer in the Eye of the Needle, where she was spotted by Sahara and Obadiah Horn. Noting how they looked so much alike, Sahara approached Panya and hired her to switches places with her every now and then so that Sahara could interact with the public anonymously while Panya distracts the world that is constantly watching Sahara, including Obadiah Horn. Panya soon grows to like being Sahara that she even tries to take her place permanently. In the end, she is murdered by Serengheti. However, Panya managed to arrange for her mother to be provided for by sending a White-Gold Elephant statuette to Vlasco and a letter telling him if he'd ever had a heart he'd sell the Elephant and give the money to her mother, as well as some parting words. \n* '''Yvette''' - Yvette was a soldier who fought the Elephantmen when they were MAPPO's soldiers. She earned a bloody reputation of carving her name onto the heads of every Elephantman she killed, driven by her [[hatred]] of them for killing her family and taking everything she had from her, causing her to swear to kill every last Elephantman. She resurfaced years after the war in [[France]] and became a serial killer, hunting and killing all Elephantmen she could find regardless of who they were, and writing the words 'No Mercy' on walls or their bodies with their blood, all the while wearing the [[skull]] of Tusk. Her killing spree comes to an end after she fails to kill Obadiah Horn. In the confrontation, Sahara tries to talk Yvette into letting go of her hatred and emotional baggage, but Yvette, full of [[Resentment|bitterness]], hatred, and [[grief]], cannot let it go and feeling there is no future for someone like her she [[Suicide|takes her own life]]. \n* '''Dr. Nikken''' - Dr. Nikken of the MAPPO corporation used kidnapped women as incubators to bring to term several experimental human/animal hybrids. He originally intended them to be used as \"weapons of mass destruction\", despite soldiers being incapable of qualifying for the term. This is likely an oversight on the part of the comic writer. Nikken has a [[god complex]] and no morals of any kind, not having a sliver of guilt or regret of the suffering he caused and the lives he'd destroyed in his experiments.\n* '''La Mantia''' - La Mantia is a government agent who oversees the Elephantmen's activities. But really, he is a part of a conspiracy called Promethean that is composed of remnants of MAPPO who wish to rise in power again using the Elephantmen, old and new. He is intelligent, ruthless, and ambitious, as he attempted to destroy Obadiah Horn and Sahara's unborn child but instead destroyed a decoy fetus that Panya had been carrying, mistaking her for the real Sahara. He and his fellow Prometheans plan an extermination of the old Elephantmen using their recently developed Transgenic Hyena Soldiers, and he personally approaches Horn to offer him leadership of the army under the thumb of the Prometheans. He arrogantly lets his guard down, which provides Horn the perfect opportunity to kill him, and he does by crushing La Mantia's head and his corpse is fed upon by his own Hyena soldiers. \n* '''Agathe''' - Agathe was a young girl who met Yvette and was inspired to fight the Elephantment for idealistic reasons. However, because of her age, Yvette didn't allow her to come with her after she recovered from Agathe's mother's hospitality. Alas, the war involving the Elephantmen soon found Agathe's family and her mother and brothers were killed. She was approached by Trench who spared her life and told her to run to France. Agathe instead took up a dead soldier's gun and started killing Elephantmen herself. She was found by human resistance fighters who took her in and told her of their plan to kill the Elephantmen invading their country. However an Elephantman soldier found their hideout and gunned them down, missing only Agathe who managed to remain hidden. Filled with rage, grief and embolded by everything she lost, Agathe went forward with her allies' plan, leaving only a message intended for the creators of the Elephantmen. She swore that even if their monsters won their land would never be their prize; she insured this by using an explosive to detonate a nuclear power plant. At the cost of her own life, Agathe single-handedly caused more deaths in the war than anyone, both Elephantman and human, and her country became a radiated wasteland.\n* '''Carlos Vlasco''' - Vlasco was the head of MAPPO security and once under Nikken's payroll. He took sadistic enjoyment of physically and mentally abusing all the Elephantmen MAPPO created and was allowed to in order to produce obedient and hard soldiers. When MAPPO was brought down, Vlasco was attacked by Ebony, who crushed his legs and stabbed him through the chest with his tusk. Miraculously, Vlasco survived and escaped prosecution by the aid of Joe. He used criminal connections to get medical treatment and new [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] legs, but was soon diagnosed with [[cancer]]. He became a [[Contract killing|hitman]] known as the Silencer and used advanced cloaking to become invisible. He killed many Elephantmen and harvested their cells to produce treatments for his cancer to prevent his death, and has killed hundreds of people in his career as a hitman, both Elephantmen and humans. He disposed of many of his victims' bodies by placing them in weighed [[body bag]]s and dumping them into a river canal. His dumping site was eventually discovered and he became known also as the River Killer.\n\n==Collected editions==\n\n* Elephantmen, vol. 0: Armed Forces- Collects Elephantmen: War Toys #1-3 Elephantmen: Yvette, Elephantmen #34-35.

''aggadot'', Ashkenazi pronunciation ''aggados'') refers to non-legalistic [[pardes (Jewish exegesis)|exegetical texts]] in the classical [[rabbinic literature]] of [[Judaism]], particularly as recorded in the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]]. In general, Aggadah is a compendium of rabbinic texts that incorporates folklore, historical anecdotes, moral exhortations, and practical advice in various spheres, from business to medicine.\n\nThe role and meaning of the Aggadah may be further clarified in terms of its [[etymology]]. \nThe direct Aramaic [[Semitic root|root]], \u05d0\u05d2\u05d3 (as well as \u05e0\u05d2\u05d3, from which \u05d0\u05d2\u05d3\u05d4 may arise), has the dual implication of \u201cexpanding\u201d / \u201cdrawing out\u201d and \u201cbinding\u201d / \u201cdrawing in\u201d.\n<ref>See corresponding entries in [[Marcus Jastrow]]: [http://www.tyndalearchive.com/tabs/jastrow/ ''A Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Babli and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic Literature''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419223729/http://www.tyndalearchive.com/tabs/jastrow/ |date=2009-04-19 }}.</ref> \nCorrespondingly, then, the Aggadah may be seen as those teachings which communicate Rabbinic traditions to the reader, simultaneously expanding their understanding of the text, while strengthening their religious experience and spiritual connection.\n<ref>Rabbi Moshe Weissman, ''The Midrash Says'' (Benei Yakov Publications, 1980), introduction to Volume 1.</ref>\n<ref>See in use, for example, at [[Rashi]]'s commentary on\n[https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9874/showrashi/true/jewish/Chapter-13.htm#v5 Exodus 13:5], where he states that Aggadic teachings \"draw the heart\" (\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d2\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d4\u05de\u05d5\u05e9\u05db\u05d9\u05df \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05dc\u05d1).</ref> \n\nThe root also has the meaning \"flow\",\n<ref>See [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] [http://mechon-mamre.org/i/t/t3407.htm 7:10] and [[Rashi]] ''ad loc'' ([http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%22%D7%92_%D7%93%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%90%D7%9C_%D7%96_%D7%99 Hebrew orig.], [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16490/showrashi/true English transl.]).</ref> \nand here relates to the transmission of ideas;\n<ref>Rabbi Nathan Cardozo, ''The Infinite Chain: Torah, Masorah, and Man'', ch. 6.</ref>\nthe [[cognate]] {{lang-he-n|\u05d4\u05b7\u05d2\u05b8\u05bc\u05d3\u05b8\u05d4}}, relatedly, means \"telling\".\n\n==As part of the Jewish oral law==\n{{Rabbinical Literature}}\nThe Aggadah is part of [[Judaism]]'s [[Oral Torah|Oral law]] ({{hebrew|\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05e9\u05d1\u05e2\u05dc \u05e4\u05d4}})\u2014the traditions providing the authoritative interpretation of the [[Written Law]]. In this context, the widely held view in [[rabbinic literature]] is that the Aggadah is in fact a medium for the transmission of fundamental teachings (Homiletic Sayings\u2014{{hebrew|\u05de\u05d0\u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d9\u05de\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd}}) or for explanations of verses in the [[Tanakh]] ([[Exegesis|Exegetic]] Sayings\u2014{{hebrew|\u05de\u05d0\u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05d9\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd}}). In Rabbinic thought, therefore, much of the Aggadah is understood as containing a hidden, allegorical dimension, in addition to its overt, literal sense. In general, where a literal interpretation contradicts rationality, the Rabbis seek an allegorical explanation: \"We are told to use our common sense to decide whether an aggada is to be taken literally or not\" (Carmell, 2005).\n\n===Literal-allegorical teachings===\nRabbi [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]], the ''Ramchal'', discusses this two-tiered, literal-allegorical mode of transmission of the Aggadah in his well-known ''Discourse on the Haggadot''. He explains that the Oral Law, in fact, comprises two components: the legal component ({{hebrew|\u05d7\u05dc\u05e7 \u05d4\u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05d5\u05ea}}), discussing the [[mitzvah|mitzvot]] and [[halakha]]; and \"the secret\" component ({{hebrew|\u05d7\u05dc\u05e7 \u05d4\u05e1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea}}), discussing the deeper teachings. The Aggadah, along with the [[Kabbalah]], falls under the latter. The rabbis of the [[Mishnah]]ic era believed that it would be dangerous to record the deeper teachings in explicit, mishnah-like, medium. Rather, they would be conveyed in a \"concealed mode\" and via \"paradoxes\". (Due to their value, these teachings should not become accessible to those \"of bad character\" and due to their depth they should not be made available to those \"not schooled in the ways of analysis\".)

Maimonides does not entirely reject rationalist interpretation, but he opposes an [[Exegesis|exegetical]] approach which denies the Aggadah a hidden rationality. \"The sages presented their ''drashot'' in a style by which the mind of a fool will reject them because of his way of thinking; it is improper to assign any deficiency to the ''drash''\u2014one may rather suspect that the deficiency is a result of his intellectual shortcomings\" (''Commentary on the Mishnah'': Introduction).\n* The third approach is to recognise that many Aggadot are intended to teach profound truths, and that the teachings thus operate on two levels: \"overt\" and \"hidden\". Thus any impossible assertion was, in fact, intended as a parable; further, where aggadot can be understood literally, they may be taken on this level. This is, in general, the view of the Rabbis. \"It is proper\u2026to carefully analyse [the Aggadot]\u2026when any of these seem far-fetched we must immerse ourselves in the various branches of knowledge until we understand the concepts.\" (Maimonides, [[op cit]].)\n\nNote that Maimonides' approach is also widely held amongst the non-rationalistic, [[kabbalah|mystical]] streams of Judaism\u2014thus, for example, Rabbi [[Isaiah Horowitz]], the ''Shlah HaKodosh'' holds that \"none of these sometimes mind-boggling 'stories' are devoid of profound meaning; if anyone is devoid of understanding, it is the reader\" (''Shnei Luchos HaBris'', introduction).\n\n===In the Talmud and Midrash===\nThe Aggadah is today recorded in the [[Midrash]] and the [[Talmud]].\n\nIn the Midrash, the aggadic and halakhic material are compiled as two distinct collections: 1) The Aggadic Midrashim, generally, are explanatory aggadah, deriving the \"sermonic implications\" from the biblical text; and 2) the [[Midrash halakha|Halakhic Midrashim]] derive the laws from the text. Many of the [[meforshim|Torah commentaries]], and the [[Targum]]im, interpret the Torah text in the light of Aggadic statements, particularly those in the Midrash, and hence contain much material on Aggadah interpretation.\n\nThroughout the Talmud, aggadic and halakhic material are interwoven\u2014legal material comprises around 90%. (Tractate [[Avoth]], which has no [[gemara]], deals exclusively with non-halakhic material, though it is not regarded as aggadic in that it is focused, largely, on character development.)

Their original forms existed long before they were reduced to writing.\n\nThe first traces of the midrashic exegesis are found in the Bible itself; while in the time of the [[Sofer]]im the development of the Midrash Aggadah received a mighty impetus, and the foundations were laid for public services which were soon to offer the chief medium for the cultivation of Bible exegesis.\n\nMuch Aggadah, often mixed with foreign elements, is found in the [[Apocrypha]], the [[Pseudepigrapha]], the works of [[Josephus]] and [[Philo]], and the remaining Jud\u00e6o-Hellenistic literature; but aggadic exegesis reached its highest development in the great epoch of the Mishnaic-Talmudic period, between 100 and 550 CE.\n\nThe Aggadah of the Amoraim (sages of the Talmud) is the continuation of that of the Tannaim (sages of the Mishna). The final edition of the Mishnah, which was of such signal importance for the Halakah, is of less significance for the Aggadah, which, in form as well as in content, shows the same characteristics in both periods.\n\n===Exegetic and homiletic Aggadah===\nIt is important to emphasize the fundamental difference in plan between the midrashim forming a running commentary (\u05de\u05d0\u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05d9\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd) to the Scripture text, and the homiletic midrashim (\u05de\u05d0\u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d9\u05de\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd). When the scholars undertook to edit, revise, and collect into individual midrashim the immense array of haggadot, they followed the method employed in the collections and revisions of the halakhot and the halakhic discussions.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} The form which suggested itself was to arrange in textual sequence the exegetical interpretations of the Biblical text as taught in the schools, or the occasional interpretations introduced into public discourses, etc., and which were in any way connected with Scripture. Since the work of the editor was often merely that of compilation, the existing midrashim show in many passages the character of the sources from which they were taken. This was the genesis of the midrashim which are in the nature of running haggadic commentaries to single books of the Bible, as Bereshit Rabbah, Eikah Rabbati, the midrashim to the other Megillot, etc. See [[Midrash]] for more details.\n\n==Modern compilations==\n''[[Ein Yaakov]]'' is a compilation of the aggadic material in the [[Babylonian Talmud]] together with commentary. It was compiled by [[Jacob ibn Habib]] and (after his death) by his son [[Levi ibn Habib]], and was first published in [[Saloniki]] (Greece) in 1515. It was intended as a text of aggadah, that could be studied with \"the same degree of seriousness as the Talmud itself\".<ref>Marjorie Lehman (1999). The Ein ya'aqov: A Collection of Aggadah in Transition. ''[[Prooftexts (journal)|Prooftexts]]'', Vol. 19, 1999.</ref> \n\n[[Mainstream|Popularized]] [[anthology|anthologies]] did not appear until more recently\u2014these often incorporate \"aggadot\" from outside of classical [[Rabbinic literature]]. The major works include:\n* ''Sefer Ha-Aggadah'' (''The Book of Legends'') is a classic compilation of aggadah from the [[Mishnah]], the two Talmuds and the [[Midrash]] literature. It was edited by [[Hayim Nahman Bialik]] and [[Yehoshua Hana Rawnitzki]]. Bialik and Ravnitzky worked for three years to compile a comprehensive and representative overview of aggadah. When they found the same aggadah in multiple versions, from multiple sources, they usually selected the later form, the one found in the Babylonian Talmud. However, they also presented some aggadot sequentially, giving the early form from the [[Jerusalem Talmud]], and later versions from the Babylonian Talmud, and from a classic midrash compilation. In each case every aggadah is given with its original source. In their original edition, they translated the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] aggadot into modern [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Sefer Ha-Aggadah was first published in 1908-11 in [[Odessa]], Russia, then reprinted numerous times in [[Israel]]. In 1992 it was translated into English as ''The Book of Legends'', by William G. Braude.\n* ''Legends of the Jews'', by Rabbi [[Louis Ginzberg]], is an original synthesis of a vast amount of aggadah from the Mishnah, the two Talmuds and Midrash. Ginzberg had an encyclopedic knowledge of all rabbinic literature, and his masterwork included a massive array of aggadot. However he did not create an anthology which showed these aggadot distinctly. Rather, he paraphrased them and rewrote them into one continuous narrative that covered five volumes, followed by two volumes of footnotes that give specific sources.\n* ''Mimekor Yisrael'', by [[Micha Josef Berdyczewski]]. Berdichevsky was interested in compiling the folklore and legends of the [[Jew]]ish people, from the earliest times up until the dawn of the modern era. His collection included a large array of aggadot, although they were limited to those he considered within the domain of folklore.\n* The collected works of Dov Noy.<ref>According to Peninnah Schram, \"Dov Noy is the fourth major figure in the renaissance of preserving and perpetuating the Jewish oral tradition. While he has published many books and important essays (including the entry \"Folklore\" in The [[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]), his two main contributions are: 1) he applied an international classification system to Jewish traditional narrative; and 2) he established the Israel Folktale Archives\"</ref> In 1954, Noy established the [http://www.folklore.org.il/asai.html Israel Folktale Archives and Ethnological Museum] at the [[University of Haifa]], an archive containing over 23,000 folktales collected from all the [[Jewish ethnic divisions|various ethnic communities]] who live in [[Israel]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Judaism}}\n* [[:Category:Aggadic Midrashim|Aggadic Midrashim (category)]]\n* [[Moses in rabbinic literature]]\n* [[Pardes (Jewish exegesis)]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* '''Traditional orientation'''\n** ''Introduction to the commentary on the Mishnah'', [[Maimonides]], transl.

''aggadot'', Ashkenazi pronunciation ''aggados'') refers to non-legalistic [[pardes (Jewish exegesis)|exegetical texts]] in the classical [[rabbinic literature]] of [[Judaism]], particularly as recorded in the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]]. In general, Aggadah is a compendium of rabbinic texts that incorporates folklore, historical anecdotes, moral exhortations, and practical advice in various spheres, from business to medicine.\n\nThe role and meaning of the Aggadah may be further clarified in terms of its [[etymology]]. \nThe direct Aramaic [[Semitic root|root]], \u05d0\u05d2\u05d3 (as well as \u05e0\u05d2\u05d3, from which \u05d0\u05d2\u05d3\u05d4 may arise), has the dual implication of \u201cexpanding\u201d / \u201cdrawing out\u201d and \u201cbinding\u201d / \u201cdrawing in\u201d.\n<ref>See corresponding entries in [[Marcus Jastrow]]: [http://www.tyndalearchive.com/tabs/jastrow/ ''A Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Babli and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic Literature''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419223729/http://www.tyndalearchive.com/tabs/jastrow/ |date=2009-04-19 }}.</ref> \nCorrespondingly, then, the Aggadah may be seen as those teachings which communicate Rabbinic traditions to the reader, simultaneously expanding their understanding of the text, while strengthening their religious experience and spiritual connection.\n<ref>Rabbi Moshe Weissman, ''The Midrash Says'' (Benei Yakov Publications, 1980), introduction to Volume 1.</ref>\n<ref>See in use, for example, at [[Rashi]]'s commentary on\n[https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9874/showrashi/true/jewish/Chapter-13.htm#v5 Exodus 13:5], where he states that Aggadic teachings \"draw the heart\" (\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d2\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d4\u05de\u05d5\u05e9\u05db\u05d9\u05df \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05dc\u05d1).</ref> \n\nThe root also has the meaning \"flow\",\n<ref>See [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] [http://mechon-mamre.org/i/t/t3407.htm 7:10] and [[Rashi]] ''ad loc'' ([http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%22%D7%92_%D7%93%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%90%D7%9C_%D7%96_%D7%99 Hebrew orig.], [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16490/showrashi/true English transl.]).</ref> \nand here relates to the transmission of ideas;\n<ref>Rabbi Nathan Cardozo, ''The Infinite Chain: Torah, Masorah, and Man'', ch. 6.</ref>\nthe [[cognate]] {{lang-he-n|\u05d4\u05b7\u05d2\u05b8\u05bc\u05d3\u05b8\u05d4}}, relatedly, means \"telling\".\n\n==As part of the Jewish oral law==\n{{Rabbinical Literature}}\nThe Aggadah is part of [[Judaism]]'s [[Oral Torah|Oral law]] ({{hebrew|\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05e9\u05d1\u05e2\u05dc \u05e4\u05d4}})\u2014the traditions providing the authoritative interpretation of the [[Written Law]]. In this context, the widely held view in [[rabbinic literature]] is that the Aggadah is in fact a medium for the transmission of fundamental teachings (Homiletic Sayings\u2014{{hebrew|\u05de\u05d0\u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d9\u05de\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd}}) or for explanations of verses in the [[Tanakh]] ([[Exegesis|Exegetic]] Sayings\u2014{{hebrew|\u05de\u05d0\u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05d9\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd}}). In Rabbinic thought, therefore, much of the Aggadah is understood as containing a hidden, allegorical dimension, in addition to its overt, literal sense. In general, where a literal interpretation contradicts rationality, the Rabbis seek an allegorical explanation: \"We are told to use our common sense to decide whether an aggada is to be taken literally or not\" (Carmell, 2005).\n\n===Literal-allegorical teachings===\nRabbi [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]], the ''Ramchal'', discusses this two-tiered, literal-allegorical mode of transmission of the Aggadah in his well-known ''Discourse on the Haggadot''. He explains that the Oral Law, in fact, comprises two components: the legal component ({{hebrew|\u05d7\u05dc\u05e7 \u05d4\u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05d5\u05ea}}), discussing the [[mitzvah|mitzvot]] and [[halakha]]; and \"the secret\" component ({{hebrew|\u05d7\u05dc\u05e7 \u05d4\u05e1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea}}), discussing the deeper teachings. The Aggadah, along with the [[Kabbalah]], falls under the latter. The rabbis of the [[Mishnah]]ic era believed that it would be dangerous to record the deeper teachings in explicit, mishnah-like, medium. Rather, they would be conveyed in a \"concealed mode\" and via \"paradoxes\". (Due to their value, these teachings should not become accessible to those \"of bad character\" and due to their depth they should not be made available to those \"not schooled in the ways of analysis\".) This mode of the transmission was nevertheless based on consistent rules and principles such that those \"equipped with the keys\" would be able to unlock their meaning; to others they would appear as non-rational or fantastic.\n\n===Interpretation of the Aggadah===\nIn line with the above, [[Samuel ibn Naghrillah]], in his \"Introduction to the Talmud\", states that \"Aggadah comprises any comment occurring in the Talmud on any topic which is not a [[mitzvah|commandment]] (i.e. which is not [[halakha|halachic]]) and one should derive from it only that which is reasonable.\" As regards this, [[Maimonides]], in his preface to the tenth chapter of [[Mishnah|Tractate]] [[Sanhedrin]] (''Perek Chelek''), describes three possible approaches to the interpretation of the Aggadah.<ref>Summary per [http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/vayechi/elkayam.html discussion] by Dr. Avraham Elkayam, Department of Philosophy, [[Bar Ilan University]]</ref>\n* The first approach is to accept the Aggadah as literally true, without admission of any hidden, allegorical explanation\u2014even where a literal interpretation runs counter to common sense.

When the scholars undertook to edit, revise, and collect into individual midrashim the immense array of haggadot, they followed the method employed in the collections and revisions of the halakhot and the halakhic discussions.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} The form which suggested itself was to arrange in textual sequence the exegetical interpretations of the Biblical text as taught in the schools, or the occasional interpretations introduced into public discourses, etc., and which were in any way connected with Scripture. Since the work of the editor was often merely that of compilation, the existing midrashim show in many passages the character of the sources from which they were taken. This was the genesis of the midrashim which are in the nature of running haggadic commentaries to single books of the Bible, as Bereshit Rabbah, Eikah Rabbati, the midrashim to the other Megillot, etc. See [[Midrash]] for more details.\n\n==Modern compilations==\n''[[Ein Yaakov]]'' is a compilation of the aggadic material in the [[Babylonian Talmud]] together with commentary. It was compiled by [[Jacob ibn Habib]] and (after his death) by his son [[Levi ibn Habib]], and was first published in [[Saloniki]] (Greece) in 1515. It was intended as a text of aggadah, that could be studied with \"the same degree of seriousness as the Talmud itself\".<ref>Marjorie Lehman (1999). The Ein ya'aqov: A Collection of Aggadah in Transition. ''[[Prooftexts (journal)|Prooftexts]]'', Vol. 19, 1999.</ref> \n\n[[Mainstream|Popularized]] [[anthology|anthologies]] did not appear until more recently\u2014these often incorporate \"aggadot\" from outside of classical [[Rabbinic literature]]. The major works include:\n* ''Sefer Ha-Aggadah'' (''The Book of Legends'') is a classic compilation of aggadah from the [[Mishnah]], the two Talmuds and the [[Midrash]] literature. It was edited by [[Hayim Nahman Bialik]] and [[Yehoshua Hana Rawnitzki]]. Bialik and Ravnitzky worked for three years to compile a comprehensive and representative overview of aggadah. When they found the same aggadah in multiple versions, from multiple sources, they usually selected the later form, the one found in the Babylonian Talmud. However, they also presented some aggadot sequentially, giving the early form from the [[Jerusalem Talmud]], and later versions from the Babylonian Talmud, and from a classic midrash compilation. In each case every aggadah is given with its original source. In their original edition, they translated the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] aggadot into modern [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Sefer Ha-Aggadah was first published in 1908-11 in [[Odessa]], Russia, then reprinted numerous times in [[Israel]]. In 1992 it was translated into English as ''The Book of Legends'', by William G. Braude.\n* ''Legends of the Jews'', by Rabbi [[Louis Ginzberg]], is an original synthesis of a vast amount of aggadah from the Mishnah, the two Talmuds and Midrash. Ginzberg had an encyclopedic knowledge of all rabbinic literature, and his masterwork included a massive array of aggadot. However he did not create an anthology which showed these aggadot distinctly. Rather, he paraphrased them and rewrote them into one continuous narrative that covered five volumes, followed by two volumes of footnotes that give specific sources.\n* ''Mimekor Yisrael'', by [[Micha Josef Berdyczewski]]. Berdichevsky was interested in compiling the folklore and legends of the [[Jew]]ish people, from the earliest times up until the dawn of the modern era. His collection included a large array of aggadot, although they were limited to those he considered within the domain of folklore.\n* The collected works of Dov Noy.<ref>According to Peninnah Schram, \"Dov Noy is the fourth major figure in the renaissance of preserving and perpetuating the Jewish oral tradition. While he has published many books and important essays (including the entry \"Folklore\" in The [[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]), his two main contributions are: 1) he applied an international classification system to Jewish traditional narrative; and 2) he established the Israel Folktale Archives\"</ref> In 1954, Noy established the [http://www.folklore.org.il/asai.html Israel Folktale Archives and Ethnological Museum] at the [[University of Haifa]], an archive containing over 23,000 folktales collected from all the [[Jewish ethnic divisions|various ethnic communities]] who live in [[Israel]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Judaism}}\n* [[:Category:Aggadic Midrashim|Aggadic Midrashim (category)]]\n* [[Moses in rabbinic literature]]\n* [[Pardes (Jewish exegesis)]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* '''Traditional orientation'''\n** ''Introduction to the commentary on the Mishnah'', [[Maimonides]], transl.

Also, do not change the Japanese names to their English translations '''UNTIL''' they have finished airing in an English speaking nation in the English dub. Being just \"close\" to airing in English is not enough; they must actually air beforehand in whatever timezone is the country of the original English airing - in the U.S. in most cases, episodes generally air in the Saturday morning time slot starting 9:00 Am - 9:30 AM EST/EDT or on Saturday evening 6:00 pm - 6:30pm EST/EDT, although there can be unique time slots. To comply with WP:CRYSTAL, you must cite a source for future air dates - only remove the citation once the episode has actually aired in the United States, and the fact that there is \"usually\" a weekly airing schedule when Pok\u00e9mon airs on Disney XD is also unreliable as other programs can be aired on the network in place of Pok\u00e9mon's time slot, delaying new English episodes by a week. Also, do not re-add or remove hidden titles before the announcement date; do not used Wikia such as fake release date are not followed scheduled.

Landini had just started making [[tractor]]s in 1925, when Giovanni died preventing the completion of the first prototype tractor. Giovanni Landini's sons took over the business and saw the completion of the tractor project.\n\n==Early models==\nIn 1925 the sons built the first authentic Italian tractor, a 30&nbsp;hp machine. It was a success and was the forerunner of the viable range of Landini 40 and 50&nbsp;hp models which appeared in the mid-1930s and were to become renowned under the names of Velite, Bufalo, and Super. The first production tractors were powered by a 40&nbsp;hp [[semi-diesel engine]] which was a [[two stroke]] single-cylinder unit. The company continued to produce semi-diesel engined tractors until 1957. When [[World War II]] started, the production stopped.<ref>[http://www.landini.it/eng/az_storia.htm Argo Tractors S.p.A. - Company - History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Diversification==\nIn 1959, the first Landini crawler tractor, the C35, was manufactured, and the company was purchased 100% by [[Massey Ferguson]].

Landini had just started making [[tractor]]s in 1925, when Giovanni died preventing the completion of the first prototype tractor. Giovanni Landini's sons took over the business and saw the completion of the tractor project.\n\n==Early models==\nIn 1925 the sons built the first authentic Italian tractor, a 30&nbsp;hp machine. It was a success and was the forerunner of the viable range of Landini 40 and 50&nbsp;hp models which appeared in the mid-1930s and were to become renowned under the names of Velite, Bufalo, and Super. The first production tractors were powered by a 40&nbsp;hp [[semi-diesel engine]] which was a [[two stroke]] single-cylinder unit. The company continued to produce semi-diesel engined tractors until 1957. When [[World War II]] started, the production stopped.<ref>[http://www.landini.it/eng/az_storia.htm Argo Tractors S.p.A. - Company - History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Diversification==\nIn 1959, the first Landini crawler tractor, the C35, was manufactured, and the company was purchased 100% by [[Massey Ferguson]].

The first two rounds were round-robin pool play, followed by a knockout round, finishing with another pool for the final. Early-round barrages were eliminated and the knockout round was a modified double elimination round.<ref name=\"sports-reference\"/><ref name=OR641to43>Official Report, pp. 641\u201343.</ref>\n\n* Round 1: 12 pools, with 6 or 7 fencers in each pool (one pool had 5 due to a withdrawal). The top 4 fencers in each pool advanced, cutting the field from 72 to 48.\n* Round 2: 8 pools, with 6 fencers per pool. Again, the top 4 fencers advanced, reducing the number of remaining fencers from 48 to 32.\n* Knockout round: This was a modified double-elimination tournament. The 32 fencers were divided into 4 groups of 8. The winner of the \"winners bracket\" in each group advanced to the final pool. The winner of the \"losers bracket\" from each group faced the winner of a different group's \"losers bracket,\" with the winner of that match advancing to the final pool as well. The knockout round winnowed the fencers from 32 to 6.\n* Final round: A final pool with the 6 remaining fencers determined the medals and 4th through 6th place.

It was the fifteenth appearance of the event. The competition was held from 21 to 22 October 1968. 72 fencers from 28 nations competed.<ref name=\"sports-reference\">{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1968/FEN/mens-epee-individual.html |title=Fencing: 1968 Olympic Results - Men's \u00e9p\u00e9e |accessdate=2010-12-23 |work=sports-reference.com}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n==Competition format==\n\nThe 1968 tournament continued to use a mix of pool play and knockout rounds, but with substantial changes from 1964. The first two rounds were round-robin pool play, followed by a knockout round, finishing with another pool for the final. Early-round barrages were eliminated and the knockout round was a modified double elimination round.<ref name=\"sports-reference\"/><ref name=OR641to43>Official Report, pp. 641\u201343.</ref>\n\n* Round 1: 12 pools, with 6 or 7 fencers in each pool (one pool had 5 due to a withdrawal). The top 4 fencers in each pool advanced, cutting the field from 72 to 48.\n* Round 2: 8 pools, with 6 fencers per pool. Again, the top 4 fencers advanced, reducing the number of remaining fencers from 48 to 32.\n* Knockout round: This was a modified double-elimination tournament. The 32 fencers were divided into 4 groups of 8. The winner of the \"winners bracket\" in each group advanced to the final pool. The winner of the \"losers bracket\" from each group faced the winner of a different group's \"losers bracket,\" with the winner of that match advancing to the final pool as well. The knockout round winnowed the fencers from 32 to 6.\n* Final round: A final pool with the 6 remaining fencers determined the medals and 4th through 6th place. A barrage was used if necessary.\n\n==Results==\n\n===Round 1===\n\n==== Round 1 Pool A ====\n\n<!-- -->{{#invoke:sports

His reign of 43 years was the longest during the Tang dynasty. In the early half of his reign he was a diligent and astute ruler. Ably assisted by capable chancellors like [[Yao Chong]], [[Song Jing]] and [[Zhang Yue (Tang dynasty)|Zhang Yue]], he was credited with bringing Tang China to a pinnacle of culture and power. Emperor Xuanzong, however, was blamed for over-trusting [[Li Linfu]], [[Yang Guozhong]] and [[An Lushan]] during his late reign, with Tang's [[golden age]] ending in the [[An Lushan Rebellion|An-Shi Rebellion]].<ref>See, e.g., ''[[Bo Yang]] Edition of the [[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', vol. 52, preface.</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|List of family of Wu Zetian}}\nLi Longji was born at the [[Tang dynasty]] eastern capital [[Luoyang]] in 685, during the first reign of his father [[Emperor Ruizong of Tang|Emperor Ruizong]] (Li Dan) \u2013 but at that time, Emperor Ruizong's mother [[Wu Zetian|Empress Dowager Wu]] (later known as Wu Zetian), not Emperor Ruizong, was in actual control of power as [[empress dowager]] and [[regent]]. Li Longji was the third son of Emperor Ruizong, and his mother was Emperor Ruizong's [[concubine]] Consort Dou, who was highly ranked. In 687, as the emperor's son, he was created the Prince of Chu. It was said that he was handsome as a child, and was talented in music.<ref name=BT8>''[[Old Book of Tang]]'', [[:zh:s:\u820a\u5510\u66f8/\u53778|vol. 8]].</ref>  He had two older brothers \u2013 [[Li Chengqi]], born of Emperor Ruizong's wife [[Empress Liu (Tang dynasty)|Empress Liu]], and Li Chengyi (\u674e\u6210\u7fa9), as well as three younger brothers \u2013 Li Longfan (\u674e\u9686\u7bc4), Li Longye (\u674e\u9686\u696d), and Li Longti (\u674e\u9686\u608c). He had two full younger sisters, Princess Jinxian (\u91d1\u4ed9\u516c\u4e3b) and Princess Yuzhen (\u7389\u771f\u516c\u4e3b), who later became Taoist nuns.<ref>''[[New Book of Tang]]'', [[:zh:s:\u65b0\u5510\u66f8/\u5377081|vol. 81]].</ref>\n\n==During Wu Zetian's reign==\nIn 690, Dowager Empress Wu had her son Emperor Ruizong yield the throne to her, and she took the throne as [[queen regnant|empress regnant]] of a new [[Zhou dynasty (690\u2013705)|Zhou dynasty]], interrupting Tang. She imposed upon Ruizong and his family the surname Wu (\u6b66) to match hers.<ref name=jts_90 /> In 692, Li Longji and his brothers were allowed to have residences outside the palace and were given staffs at their mansions.<ref name=BT8/>  In 693, both his mother Consort Dou and Li Dan's wife [[Empress Liu (Tang dynasty)|Crown Princess Liu]] (Li Dan's having been reduced to [[crown prince]] rank at that point) were killed by Wu Zetian inside the palace after Wu Zetian's [[lady-in-waiting]] Wei Tuan'er (\u97cb\u5718\u5152) falsely accused them of using witchcraft against Wu Zetian \u2013 and not even their bodies were recovered.<ref name=ZZTJ205>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377205|vol. 205]].</ref>  Subsequently, all of Li Dan's sons were reduced in title, and Li Longji's title was reduced to Prince of Linzi. He and his brothers, along with their cousins Li Guangshun (\u674e\u5149\u9806) the Prince of Yifeng, [[Li Shouli]] the Prince of Yong, and Li Shouyi (\u674e\u5b88\u7fa9) the Prince of Yong'an (the sons of their uncle [[Li Xian (prince)|Li Xi\u00e1n]], formerly crown prince but who had been forced by Wu Zetian to commit suicide in 684), were kept inside the palace and not allowed to have contact with outsiders<ref name=ZZTJ204>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377204|vol. 204]],</ref> until 699, when they were allowed to leave the palace and take up residences outside.<ref name=ZZTJ206>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377206|vol. 206]].</ref>\n\n==During Emperor Zhongzong's second reign==\nIn 705, Wu Zetian was overthrown in a coup, and Li Longji's uncle [[Emperor Zhongzong of Tang|Li Xi\u0103n]] (note different person than the father of Li Guangshun, Li Shouli, and Li Shouyi), who was at that time crown prince (Li Dan having yielded that title to him in 698 and taken the title of Prince of Xiang), who had been briefly emperor prior to Li Dan, returned to the throne (as Emperor Zhongzong). Li Longji was made the deputy minister of military supplies (\u885b\u5c09\u5c11\u537f, ''Weiwei Shaoqing''). In 708, he was made the secretary general of Lu Prefecture (\u6f5e\u5dde, roughly modern [[Changzhi]], [[Shanxi]]). In 710, he was recalled to the capital [[Chang'an]] to attend to Emperor Zhongzong when Emperor Zhongzong was sacrificing to heaven and earth. Meanwhile, sorcerers engaged by Emperor Zhongzong believed that there was an aura of an emperor at the area of Chang'an where the mansions Li Longji and his uncles were, and Emperor Zhongzong tried to fulfill the vision by visiting Li Longji's mansion and attending a feast there.<ref name=BT8/>  While Li Longji was back in Chang'an, he spent time to cultivate relationships with imperial guard commanders, as he believed that Emperor Zhongzong's powerful wife [[Empress Wei (Tang dynasty)|Empress Wei]] would bring harm to the Tang dynasty.<ref name=ZZTJ209>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377209|vol. 209]].</ref>\n\n==Coup against Empress Dowager Wei==\nIn summer 710, Emperor Zhongzong died suddenly\u2014a death that traditional historians believed to be a poisoning by Empress Wei and her daughter Li Guo'er the [[Princess Anle]] so that Empress Wei could become \"emperor\" like Wu Zetian and Li Guo'er could become crown princess. For the time being, Emperor Zhongzong's son by a concubine, [[Emperor Shang of Tang|Li Chongmao]] the Prince of Wen, was named emperor (as Emperor Shang), but Empress Wei retained actual power as empress dowager and regent. Originally, Empress Dowager Wei's clan members, along with Zong, Li Guo'er's husband Wu Yanxiu, and other officials Zhao L\u00fcwen (\u8d99\u5c65\u6eab) and Ye Jingneng (\u8449\u975c\u80fd) were advising her to take the throne, like Wu Zetian did, and they also advised her to eliminate Li Dan and Princess Taiping. The official [[Cui Riyong]] leaked their plan to Li Longji. Li Longji responded by conspiring with Princess Taiping, Princess Taiping's son Xue Chongjian (\u859b\u5d07\u7c21), as well as several low-level officials close to him\u2014[[Zhong Shaojing]], Wang Chongye (\u738b\u5d07\u66c4), [[Liu Youqiu]], and Ma Sizong (\u9ebb\u55e3\u5b97)\u2014to act first. Meanwhile, Empress Wei's nephews Wei Bo (\u97cb\u64ad) and Gao Song (\u9ad8\u5d69), who had recently been put in command of imperial guards and who had tried to establish their authority by dealing with the guards harshly, had alienated the guards, and the guard officers Ge Fushun (\u845b\u798f\u9806), [[Chen Xuanli]] (\u9673\u7384\u79ae), and Li Xianfu (\u674e\u4ed9\u9ce7) thereafter also joined the plot.<ref name=ZZTJ209/>\n\nWithout first informing Li Dan, the conspirators rose on 21 July, first killing Wei Bo, Gao, and Empress Wei's cousin Wei Gui (\u97cb\u74bf). They then attacked the palace. When Empress Dowager Wei panicked and fled to an imperial guard camp, a guard beheaded her. Li Guo'er, Wu Yanxiu, and Lady Helou were killed as well. Li Longji soon slaughtered a number of officials in Empress Dowager's faction as well as her clan, while displaying Empress Dowager Wei's body on the street. At the urging of Princess Taiping, Li Longji, and Li Longji's brother Li Chengqi, Li Dan soon took the throne from Li Chongmao and again became emperor (as Emperor Ruizong).<ref name=ZZTJ209/>\n\n==During Emperor Ruizong's second reign==\nEmperor Ruizong was immediately faced with the issue of whom to make crown prince\u2014as Li Chengqi, as the oldest son overall and the oldest son of his wife, was the appropriate heir under [[Confucian]] principles of succession, but Li Longji had been the one whose accomplishments had allowed him to retake the throne. He hesitated. Li Chengqi declined consideration to be crown prince\u2014stating to his father:\n\n{{quote|If the state were secure, then consideration should be first given to the oldest son of the wife. If the state were in danger, then consideration should be first given for achievement. If you did not follow this principle, the people of the entire empire will be disappointed. I would rather die than to be placed above the Prince of Ping [(i.e., Li Longji, whose title had been changed to Prince of Ping by this point)].}}\n\nLi Chengqi wept and begged to yield for several days, and after further persuasion by the [[Chancellor of the Tang dynasty|chancellor]] [[Liu Youqiu]]\u2014who had been part of Li Longji's coup plans\u2014Emperor Ruizong agreed and created Li Longji crown prince. Li Longji submitted a petition offering to yield to Li Chengqi, but Emperor Ruizong rejected it.<ref name=ZZTJ209/>\n\nInitially, Princess Taiping agreed to Li Longji's ascension as crown prince despite the fact that Li Longji was not Emperor Ruizong's oldest son and was not born of Emperor Ruizong's wife Empress Liu (Li Chengqi was both\u2014and therefore pursuant to Confucian principles of succession should have been crown prince) as she believed that Li Longji was young (25 at the time he was made crown prince) and would be easy to control. However, once she began to see that Li Longji was strong-willed, she became apprehensive and often had officials close to her publicly opine that Li Longji was an improper crown prince. She further often paid Li Longji's staff members to spy on him to try to find faults with him. She associated with a group of officials, including the chancellors [[Dou Huaizhen]], [[Xiao Zhizhong]], and [[Cen Xi]], intending to find some way to remove Li Longji, but was unable to get two other chancellors\u2014[[Wei Anshi]] and [[Song Jing]]\u2014to join her group.<ref name=ZZTJ210>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377210|vol. 210]].</ref>\n\nIn 711, Song and another chancellor, [[Yao Chong|Yao Yuanzhi]], tried to persuade Emperor Ruizong to carry out a plan that they believed would end her plotting. They proposed that the two princes who arguably had superior claims on the throne than Li Longji\u2014Li Chengqi and Li Shouli (whose father [[Li Xian (prince)|Li Xian]] (note different character than Emperor Zhongzong) was an older brother to both Emperors Zhongzong and Ruizong)\u2014be sent out of the capital [[Chang'an]] to serve as prefectural prefects, while Princess Taiping and Wu Youji be sent to live in Luoyang. They also proposed that Li Longji be put in charge of most affairs of state. Emperor Ruizong initially agreed and made the orders as Song and Yao suggested, except that he believed that Luoyang was too far and therefore sent Princess Taiping and Wu Youji only to Pu Prefecture (\u84b2\u5dde, roughly modern [[Yuncheng]], [[Shanxi]]). After Princess Taiping found out that the plan was conceived by Song and Yao, however, she was incensed and let Li Longji know her anger. In fear, Li Longji submitted a petition accusing Song and Yao of alienating him from his brothers Li Chengqi and Li Shouli (who was actually a cousin but was raised with Emperor Ruizong's sons) and aunt Princess Taiping, asking that the two be put to death. Emperor Ruizong, in response, demoted Song and Yao and recalled Princess Taiping, Li Chengqi, and Li Shouli to the capital. In the aftermaths, Li Longji submitted another request to yield the crown prince position to Li Chengqi, but Emperor Ruizong declined it. Also in 711, Emperor Ruizong posthumously honored both Empress Liu and Li Longji's mother Consort Dou as empresses and built a temple for them to be worshipped, but was unable to locate their bodies for reburial, and therefore had to give them a ceremonial reburial without the bodies. Emperor Ruizong also ordered that all minor matters be decided by Li Longji.<ref name=ZZTJ210/>\n\nIn 712, Princess Taiping had astrologers warn Emperor Ruizong that the constellation that symbolized the imperial throne, ''Dizuo'' (\u5e1d\u5ea7), showed that there would be a change in the emperor's position\u2014believing that Emperor Ruizong would suspect Li Longji of plotting a coup and that she could remove Li Longji this way. Instead, Emperor Ruizong, reasoning that the change in the emperor's position could be accounted by an orderly transition, offered to pass the throne to Li Longji. Princess Taiping fervently opposed it, and Li Longji initially declined, but at Emperor Ruizong's insistence finally accepted and took the throne on 8 September<ref name=Ascension/> (as Emperor Xuanzong). However, at Princess Taiping's suggestion, Emperor Ruizong retained much of the imperial power as ''[[Taishang Huang]]'' (retired emperor), and his edicts continued to carry greater force than Emperor Xuanzong's.<ref name=ZZTJ210/>\n\n==As emperor==\n\n===''Xiantian'' era (712\u2013713)===\n[[Image:Meister des Tributpferdes 001.jpg|thumb|right|240px|''A Tributary Horse for Emperor Xuanzong'', painted in the 12th century during the subsequent [[Song dynasty]]]]\n\nEmperor Xuanzong made his wife [[Empress Wang (Xuanzong)|Crown Princess Wang]] empress. Meanwhile, Princess Taiping continued to be highly influential in governmental matters through Emperor Ruizong, and most chancellors were her associates.  (Of the seven chancellors at the time, five \u2013 Dou Huaizhen, Xiao Zhizhong, Cen Xi, [[Cui Shi]], and [[Lu Xiangxian]] \u2013 were made chancellors at her recommendation, although Lu was not considered a member of her party.)  Liu Youqiu and the general Zhang Wei (\u5f35\u6690), with Emperor Xuanzong's approval, planned to mobilize the imperial guards to kill several of those chancellors \u2013 [[Dou Huaizhen]], [[Cui Shi]] and [[Cen Xi]]. However, after Zhang told the plan to the imperial censor Deng Guangbin (\u9127\u5149\u8cd3), the news was leaked. Liu was arrested, and initially set to be executed. Emperor Xuanzong interceded on his behalf with Emperor Ruizong, and Liu, Zhang, and Deng were spared but exiled.<ref name=ZZTJ210/>\n\nLater in 712, Emperor Ruizong decreed that Emperor Xuanzong lead a group of soldiers to examine the northern border. However, the group of conscripted soldiers was disbanded in spring 713, and the plan was never carried out.<ref name=ZZTJ210/>\n\nBy summer 713, it was said that Princesses Taiping, Dou, Cen, Xiao, Cui; along with other officials [[Xue Ji]], Li Jin (\u674e\u6649) the Prince of Xinxing (a grandson of Li Deliang (\u674e\u5fb7\u826f), a cousin of Tang's founder [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang|Emperor Gaozu]]), Li You (\u674e\u7337), Jia Yingfu (\u8cc8\u81ba\u798f), Tang Jun (\u5510\u6659); the generals Chang Yuankai (\u5e38\u5143\u6977), Li Ci (\u674e\u6148), and Li Qin (\u674e\u6b3d); and the monk Huifan, were plotting to overthrow Emperor Xuanzong. It was further said that they discussed, with the lady in waiting Lady Yuan to poison the ''[[gastrodia elata]]'' that Emperor Xuanzong routinely took as an aphrodisiac. When this alleged plot was reported to Emperor Xuanzong by [[Wei Zhigu]], Emperor Xuanzong, who had already received advice from Wang Ju (\u738b\u741a), [[Zhang Yue (Tang dynasty)|Zhang Shuo]], and [[Cui Riyong]] to act first, did so. He convened a meeting with his brothers Li Longfan the Prince of Qi and Li Longye the Prince of Xue (who had changed their names to Li Fan and Li Ye by this point to observe [[naming taboo]] for Emperor Xuanzong), [[Guo Yuanzhen]], along with a number of his associates \u2014 the general Wang Maozhong (\u738b\u6bdb\u4ef2), the officials Jiang Jiao (\u59dc\u768e) and Li Lingwen (\u674e\u4ee4\u554f), his brother-in-law Wang Shouyi (\u738b\u5b88\u4e00), the [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]] [[Gao Lishi]], and the military officer Li Shoude (\u674e\u5b88\u5fb7)\u2014and decided to act first.

Then, Jia, Li You, Xiao, and Cen were arrested and executed as well. Dou fled into a canyon and committed suicide by hanging. Xue Ji was forced to commit suicide. When Emperor Ruizong heard about this, he quickly ascended the tower at Chengtian Gate (\u627f\u5929\u9580) to ascertain what was happening. Guo reported to him Emperor Xuanzong's intentions, and Emperor Ruizong felt compelled to affirm Emperor Xuanzong's actions in an edict. The next day, Emperor Ruizong issued an edict transferring all authorities to Emperor Xuanzong and moved to a secondary palace, Baifu Hall (\u767e\u798f\u6bbf) and would remain there until his death in 716.<ref name=ZZTJ210/><ref name=ZZTJ211>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377211|vol. 211]].</ref>\n\n===''Kaiyuan'' era (713\u2013741)===\nEmperor Xuanzong's ''Kaiyuan'' era is usually viewed as one of the golden ages of Chinese history \u2013 a period of political stability, peace in society, and economic prosperity, in addition to advances in education, literature, music, painting, sculpture, and religion.<ref>See, e.g., ''Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian'', vol. 51, Preface.</ref>\n\n====Early ''Kaiyuan'' era====\n[[Image:Spring Outing of the Tang Court.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Spring Outing of the Tang Court'', by Xuanzong era artist [[Zhang Xuan]], 8th century original]]\nMeanwhile, [[Zhang Yue (Tang dynasty)|Zhang Yue]] and Liu Youqiu served as chancellors, but they were soon displaced by Yao Yuanzhi (who then changed his name to [[Yao Chong]]) and [[Lu Huaishen]]. Changing the system of having a large group of chancellors simultaneous, as had been the case throughout Tang, Emperor Xuanzong reduced the numbers to two (or sometimes three) for the rest of his reign.<ref>''New Book of Tang'', [[:zh:s:\u65b0\u5510\u66f8/\u5377062|vol. 62]].</ref>  Yao was considered a highly capable administrator, and with him ruling on most important matters and Lu assisting, the government was said to be highly efficient.<ref name=ZZTJ211/>\n\nIn 714, Emperor Xuanzong carried out a series of political reprisals against the cruel secret police officials of Wu Zetian's reign, exiling the ones that were still alive and eventually barring their descendants from holding political offices. At the urging of Jiang Jiao's brother Jiang Hui ({{lang|zh|\u59dc\u8aa8}}), he also exiled a number of chancellors \u2013 [[Wei Sili]], [[Wei Anshi]], [[Zhao Yanzhao]], and [[Li Jiao (Tang dynasty)|Li Jiao]] \u2013 from Emperor Zhongzong's reign whom Jiang accused of being unable to curb Empress Wei's abuse of power.<ref name=ZZTJ211/>\n\nAlso in 714, Emperor Xuanzong, wanting to punish the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] and the [[Kumo Xi|Xi]] for having defeated Tang forces during Emperor Zhongzong's reign, commissioned the general [[Xue Ne]] to attack them, but Xue suffered another devastating loss to them, at the casualty rate of 80\u201390%. However, later in the year, when the [[Tibetan Empire]] attacked, Emperor Xuanzong again commissioned Xue to defend against the attack, and Xue was able to repel the Tibetan forces. Subsequently, though, although both sides tried to invoke the marriage between Li Shouli's daughter Princess Jincheng and [[Me Agtsom]], emperor of the Tibetan Empire, in seeking peace, the two sides could not reach an agreement and remained in border conflict yearly. In response, Emperor Xuanzong established the office of ''[[jiedushi]]'' (military governor) of Longyou Circuit ({{lang|zh|\u96b4\u53f3}}, headquartered in what is now [[Haidong]], [[Qinghai]]), with a centralized command of 12 prefectures under a single military general.<ref name=ZZTJ211/>  Eventually, the establishment of ''jiedushi'' would be extended to other parts of the empire.<ref>Bo Yang, ''Outlines of the History of the Chinese'' ({{lang|zh|\u4e2d\u570b\u4eba\u53f2\u7db1}}), vol. 2, pp. 544\u2013546.</ref>\n\nAlso in 714, Emperor Xuanzong created [[Li Ying (prince)|Li Siqian]], his second son and the son of his then-favorite concubine Consort Zhao, crown prince.  (Emperor Xuanzong's wife Empress Wang was sonless.)<ref name=ZZTJ211/>\n\nMeanwhile, the Tang relationship with [[Qapaghan Qaghan]] of the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks]] had fluctuated during the first few years of the ''Kaiyuan'' era, as minor hostilities occurred at the borders as well as contests over vassals' loyalty for the two states, but they were also at times friendly to each other, with Qapaghan requesting at times to marry a Tang princess and Emperor Xuanzong agreeing to the proposal. In 716, however, Qapaghan was killed in battle against the Bayegu ({{lang|zh|\u62d4\u91ce\u53e4}}), and from that point on, lacking his efficient leadership, the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks, while remaining an important regional power, posed much less of a threat to China,<ref name=ZZTJ211/> although at times still capable of dealing serious defeats to Tang forces, as was the case in 720 when the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk general [[Tonyukuk]] defeated the Tang garrison at Liang Prefecture (\u6dbc\u5dde, roughly modern [[Wuwei, Gansu|Wuwei]], [[Gansu]]) and the Tang vassal [[Basmyl]].<ref name=ZZTJ212>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377212|vol. 212]].</ref>  Meanwhile, Tang, the Tibetan Empire, and the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] were constantly engaging in a three-way tug of war for influence in the [[Western Regions|Xiyu]] (i.e., modern [[Xinjiang]] and former Soviet [[Central Asia]]) region. In 715, for example, when the king of Bahanna ({{lang|zh|\u62d4\u6c57\u90a3}}) was expelled by a new king supported by the Tibetan Empire and the Umayyad Caliphate, Tang forces commanded by the general {{Interlanguage link multi|Zhang Xiaosong|2=zh|3=\u5f20\u5b5d\u5d69|preserve=1}} ({{lang|zh|\u5f35\u5b5d\u5d69}}) attacked the new king and restored the old king.<ref name=ZZTJ211/> General Tang Jiahui led the Chinese to defeat the following Arab-Tibetan attack in the [[Battle of Aksu (717)]].<ref name=\"Guides2017\">{{cite book|author=Insight Guides|title=Insight Guides Silk Road|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X4mPDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT120&dq=715+Alutar+Ikhshid&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiI3vzSqf7ZAhXMUlAKHT9hDJkQ6AEIJzAA|date=1 April 2017|publisher=APA|isbn=978-1-78671-699-6|pages=}}</ref> The attack on Aksu was joined by [[Turgesh]] Khan [[Suluk (Turgesh khagan)|Suluk]].<ref name=\"Grousset1970\">{{cite book|author=Ren\u00e9 Grousset|title=The Empire of the Steppes: A History of Central Asia|url=https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppes00grou|url-access=registration|quote=aksu 717.|year=1970|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-1304-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppes00grou/page/114 114]\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Skaff2012\">{{cite book|author=Jonathan Karam Skaff|title=Sui-Tang China and Its Turko-Mongol Neighbors: Culture, Power, and Connections, 580-800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jrv-6_U5gfwC&pg=PA311&dq=aksu+717&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjFwZy0qP7ZAhUDb1AKHfnVD-EQ6AEILzAB|date=6 August 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-999627-8|pages=311\u2013}}</ref> Both [[Uqturpan County|Uch Turfan]] and [[Aksu City|Aksu]] were attacked by the Turgesh, Arab, and Tibetan force on 15 August 717.

At Yao's suggestion, Emperor Xuanzong ordered an extensive campaign of extermination, which was said to reduce the impact of the infestation and ward off a major [[famine]]. Later in 716, however, due a corruption scandal involving Yao's sons and his associate Zhao Hui ({{lang|zh|\u8d99\u8aa8}}), Yao incurred displeasure from Emperor Xuanzong and offered to resign. He and [[Yuan Qianyao]], who replaced Lu after Lu's death earlier in 716, were removed from their offices and replaced with [[Song Jing]] and [[Su Ting]], with Song making more of the important decisions and Su assisting.  Yao would not return to the chancellorship, but would remain influential as a key advisor for Emperor Xuanzong until Yao's death in 721.  Contrary to the practical and flexible Yao, Song was more interested in emphasizing integrity and rule of law in governance, and it was said that while Yao's and Song's emphases were different, they were both regarded as instrumental in establishing the rule of ''Kaiyuan'' and that subsequent chancellors could not compare to them.<ref name=ZZTJ211/>\n\nMeanwhile, Song and Su had carried out a stern campaign against the use of coins that were not officially forged by the government, which brought popular resentment that Emperor Xuanzong found problematic. In 720, he removed Song and Su from chancellor offices and replaced them with Yuan and [[Zhang Jiazhen]], and in 721 added Zhang Yue as a chancellor as well.<ref name=ZZTJ212/>\n\nMeanwhile, by 722, Empress Wang, who had contributed to Emperor Xuanzong's reign by providing suggestions, had begun to lose favor to [[Consort Wu]], a great-grandniece of Emperor Xuanzong's grandmother Wu Zetian. Emperor Xuanzong secretly discussed with Jiang Jiao the possibility of deposing her, but Jiang Jiao careless leaked the discussion. At the urging of Zhang Jiazhen, who was friendly with Empress Wang's brother Wang Shouyi (\u738b\u5b88\u4e00), advocated that Jiang Jiao be punished and exiled, and Jiang died in exile.\n\nMeanwhile, at Zhang Yue's suggestion, the Tang northern border defense forces, which had about 600,000 men at that time, was reduced by 200,000 men to allow the soldiers to return home. Further, seeing that the Tang conscription system, due to abuses against the soldiers at the time, was near a collapse, as the soldiers were forced into long tours of duty but their families were not exempt from taxes, thus causing great numbers of desertions, Zhang suggested a switch to a recruitment-based system where soldiers were paid salaries. This allowed, for a time, Tang's soldier supply to be replenished.  (Some later historians condemned Zhang for the abolition of the conscription system, believing the abolition to be the root of Tang's later fracturing, but some others, such as the modern historian [[Bo Yang]], argued that Zhang's actions not only were necessary to restore the supply of soldiers but saved many lives.<ref>See, e.g., ''Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian'', vol. 51, 722.</ref>)\n\n====Middle ''Kaiyuan'' era====\n[[Image:Audience by Emperor Tang Xuanzong.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Emperor Xuanzong giving audience to [[Elder Zhang Guo|Zhang Guo]], by [[Ren Renfa]] (1254\u20131327)]]\nIn 723, Zhang Jiazhen was demoted on account of a corruption scandal involving his brother Zhang Jiayou (\u5f35\u5609\u7950). His position was filled by [[Wang Jun (Tang chancellor)|Wang Jun]], who was soon himself demoted over suspicions, never proven, that he was plotting treason.<ref>''Old Book of Tang'', [[:zh:s:\u820a\u5510\u66f8/\u537793|vol. 93]].</ref>  With Zhang Yue thus effectively being the senior chancellor, Zhang Yue promoted literary studies, which Emperor Xuanzong also favored. In 724, he also commissioned the chief imperial astronomer Nangong Shuo (\u5357\u5bae\u8aaa) to carry out a major astronomical survey to observe the sun and the [[North Star]] at various points of the empire.<ref name=ZZTJ212/>\n\nAlso in 724, it was discovered that Wang Shouyi had engaged sorcerers to make amulets for Empress Wang to wear, hoping that the use of magic would allow her to have a son. Empress Wang was deposed and reduced to commoner rank, while Wang Shouyi was exiled and subsequently ordered to commit suicide in exile. Empress Wang died later in the year, and it was said that the eunuchs and the ladies in waiting mourned her bitterly and Emperor Xuanzong much regretted his treatment of her.<ref name=ZZTJ212/>  Still, after Empress Wang's removal and death, Consort Wu became undisputed mistress of the palace and was treated inside the palace like an empress would be. Still, in 726, when Emperor Xuanzong considered creating her empress, he encountered oppositions from officials on two grounds \u2013 that her Wu clan was hated by the people and that as she had her own sons, the position of Li Siqian the Crown Prince (whose name had been changed to Li Hong by this point) would be threatened. As a result, Emperor Xuanzong never created her empress.<ref name=ZZTJ213>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377213|vol. 213]].</ref>\n\nIn winter 725, Emperor Xuanzong, at Zhang Yue's urging, carried out a magnificent ceremony at [[Mount Tai]] to offer sacrifices to heaven and earth.<ref name=ZZTJ212/>\n\nIn 726, Zhang Yue was accused of corruption by several officials that he had blocked the advances of \u2013 Cui Yinfu (\u5d14\u96b1\u752b), [[Yuwen Rong]], and [[Li Linfu]] \u2013 and was found to have committed corruption. At the intercession of [[Gao Lishi]], however, Zhang Yue was removed only from his chancellor post and permitted to maintain his title and a number of other posts. He was replaced by [[Li Yuanhong (Tang chancellor)|Li Yuanhong]], and subsequently, [[Du Xian (Tang dynasty)|Du Xian]] was also added as a chancellor.<ref name=ZZTJ213/>\n\nIn 727, at the suggestion of the general Wang Junchuo (\u738b\u541b\u369f), Emperor Xuanzong commissioned Wang Junchuo to attack the Tibetan Empire, and after a Tibetan incursion in late 726, Wang counterattacked and inflicted losses on Tibetan forces commanded by the general Xinuoluogonglu (\u6089\u8afe\u908f\u606d\u797f). Later in the year, though, Xinuoluogonglu and another general, Zhulongmangbuzhi (\u71ed\u9f8d\u83bd\u5e03\u652f) attacked and captured Wang's home prefecture Gua Prefecture (\u74dc\u5dde, roughly modern [[Jiuquan]], [[Gansu]]), taking Wang's father Wang Shou (\u738b\u58fd) captive. As a result, Wang Junchuo did not dare to counterattack, and subsequently blamed the defeat on a number of tribal chiefs in the area and had them exiles. In response, Yaoluoge Hushu (\u85e5\u7f85\u845b\u8b77\u8f38), the nephew of one of the chiefs so exiled, Yaoluoge Chengzong (\u85e5\u7f85\u845b\u627f\u5b97), ambushed Wang Junchuo and killed him, and while Yaoluoge Hushu was forced to flee thereafter, for several years Tang did not engage in any offensive campaigns in the region.<ref name=ZZTJ213/>\n\nAround the same time, Emperor Xuanzong began to build a residential complex in the palace for imperial clan members, known as the Mansion of the Ten Princes (\u5341\u738b\u9662), to centralize their residence. Thereafter, imperial princes, including the crown prince, would rarely live outside the palace complex.<ref name=ZZTJ213/>\n\nIn 728, Emperor Xuanzong added the general [[Xiao Song]] as a chancellor. Subsequently, in 729, with Yuan, even though he was senior chancellor, unable to curb the disputes between Li Yuanhong and Du, Emperor Xuanzong removed all three from chancellor positions, promoting Yuwen and [[Pei Guangting]] to be chancellors in their stead \u2013 in Yuwen's case, for his abilities to find ways to add to the imperial treasury by imposing special taxes and levies. Later in the year, though, Yuwen made false accusations against the general Li Hui (\u674e\u8918) the Prince of Xin'an (Emperor Xuanzong's second cousin) and was exiled, and subsequently died in exile. Still, it was said that it was starting from Yuwen's times that Emperor Xuanzong began to pay attention on taxes to replenish the imperial treasury, which traditional historians viewed as the start of his inflicting financial burdens on the people. Further, with Pei in charge of the civil service system, it was said that due to Pei's strict adherence to seniority, the Tang civil service system began to lose its ability to find talented people to serve in offices.<ref name=ZZTJ213/>\n\nIn 730, the Khitan general Ketugan (\u53ef\u7a81\u5e72) killed the king Li Shaogu (\u674e\u90b5\u56fa) and took over the reign of the Khitan and the Xi personally, forcing the king of the Xi, Li Lusu (\u674e\u9b6f\u8607) to flee to Tang for protection. Tang sent an army to attack the Khitan, but meanwhile made peace with the Tibetan Empire. Initially, the campaign against the Khitan did not succeed, but in 732, with Li Hui in command, Tang forces dealt Ketugan a serious defeat and causing many of Ketugan's subordinates to defect and submit to Tang, although Ketugan was not captured.\n\n====Late ''Kaiyuan'' era====\n[[Image:Li Zhao Dao Tang Ming Huang to Shu.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Xuanzong's Journey to Shu'', in the manner of the mid 8th century Tang artist Li Zhaodao, an 11th-century [[Song dynasty]] remake]]\nMeanwhile, Tang also began to have periodic conflicts with [[Balhae]], and in 733 Emperor Xuanzong tried to commission [[Dae Mun-ye]] (\u5927\u9580\u85dd), the brother of Balhae's [[Mu of Balhae|King Mu]], to attack Balhae, along with forces from [[Silla]], but the attack was not successful.<ref name=ZZTJ213/>\n\nAlso in 733, Pei Guangting died, and at the recommendation of Xiao Song, he was replaced with [[Han Xiu]], but soon, Song and Han were in repeated conflicts, and late in 733, both were removed and replaced with [[Pei Yaoqing]], who became known for improving the food distribution system, and [[Zhang Jiuling]], known for his integrity.<ref name=ZZTJ213/><ref name=ZZTJ214>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377214|vol. 214]].</ref>  In 734, Emperor Xuanzong added [[Li Linfu]], a close associate of Consort Wu, as a chancellor as well.<ref name=ZZTJ214/>\n\nAround the new year 735, Ketuhan was killed in an internal Khitan power struggle, and Khitan became a vassal again, although it would not stay so permanently.<ref name=ZZTJ214/>\n\nBy 736, Emperor Xuanzong was described as having been tired of important affairs of state and beginning to become wasteful and exuberant in his lifestyle. Zhang tried to curb his behavior but thus began to lose favor, while Li Linfu was gaining power due to his association with Consort Wu. Further, Zhang supported Li Hong (whose name had been changed to Li Ying by this point), while Li Linfu and Consort Wu supported her son Li Mao (\u674e\u7441) the Prince of Shou and tried to have Li Mao made crown prince. In 736, due to Li Linfu's machinations that made Emperor Xuanzong believed that Zhang and Pei Yaoqing were improperly engaging in factionalism, Zhang and Pei Yaoqing were removed and replaced by [[Niu Xianke]], who closely followed Li Linfu's will, and thereafter, Li Linfu would dominate the imperial government almost to the end of Emperor Xuanzong's reign. Li Linfu did all he could to stay in power, and carried out many dirty tricks against actual or potential threats to his power. He also severely discouraged criticism, ending the relative freedom that officials had to make proposals to Emperor Xuanzong. This was often viewed by traditional historians as the turning point of Emperor Xuanzong's reign, which up to that point was considered a golden age in Chinese history, toward a path of degeneration. The [[Song dynasty]] historian [[Sima Guang]], in his ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', for example, commented:<ref name=ZZTJ214/>\n\n{{quote|Of the chancellors that the Emperor commissioned after he took the throne, Yao Chong emphasized flexibility, Song Jing emphasized the rule of law, Zhang Jiazhen emphasized administrative abilities, Zhang Shuo emphasized literary talent, Li Yuanhong and Du Xian emphasized frugality, and Han Xiu and Zhang Jiuling emphasized honesty. All of them had their different talents. After Zhang Jiuling was demoted, however, the officials were all concerned about keeping their positions, and honest words no longer had a place in government.}}\n\nIn 737, with Zhang no longer in the government to protect him, Li Ying was deposed and subsequently forced to commit suicide. However, with Consort Wu dying later in the year, Emperor Xuanzong did not immediately accept Li Linfu's proposal to have Li Mao made crown prince. Rather, he chose an older son, [[Emperor Suzong of Tang|Li Yu]] the Prince of Zhong, in 738.\n\n===''Tianbao'' era (742\u2013756)===\n[[Image:Emperor Minghuang's Journey to Sichuan, Freer Gallery of Art.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Emperor Xuanzong's Journey to Sichuan'', a late [[Ming dynasty]] painting after [[Qiu Ying]] (1494\u20131552).]]\nHistorians said that Emperor Xuanzong forced tens of thousand beautiful women to live in his palace to please him, more than many other [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] emperors.<ref>New Book of Tang, vol.132</ref> And he did not allow many to be set free even when they were old.<ref>[[Dao Fu]]. ''\u4e0a\u967d\u767d\u9aee\u4eba''</ref> As Emperor Xuanzong turned his attention to pleasure-seeking with his favorite concubine [[Yang Guifei]] and her family, he paid less and less attention to the running of his empire, and much of his power fell into the hands of the corrupt [[Li Linfu]] (who was succeeded by Lady Yang's dissolute cousin [[Yang Guozhong]]) and the eunuch [[Gao Lishi]].\n\nAt the same time, 751 saw the loss of the [[Battle of Talas]] against the Abbasid Caliphate. As a consequence, the Tang dynasty temporarily lost some of its influence in Central Asia to the emerging Abbasid Caliphate, as several Tang tributaries turned to the Abbasids.\n\nMeanwhile, the ''jiedushi'' (military governors), most of whom were non-[[Han Chinese|Han]] took more and more regional power into their own hands. Some successful generals included [[Geshu Han]], known for victories over the [[Tibetan Empire]]; [[Gao Xianzhi]], who conquered city states of the Xiyu region, eventually battling the Abbasids at Talas; and [[An Lushan]] who defeated and once again vassalized the Khitan. Eventually, in 755, An Lushan started the [[Anshi Rebellion]] at [[Fanyang]]. The rebels quickly seized the eastern capital [[Luoyang]], and then the imperial capital [[Chang'an]] six months later. Emperor Xuanzong fled to [[Sichuan]] during the war and abdicated the throne to Li Yu (whose name had been changed to Li Heng at that point) (as Emperor Suzong).\n\n====Early ''Tianbao'' era====\nMeanwhile, at Li Linfu's encouragement, Emperor Xuanzong began to promote non-[[Han Chinese|Han]] generals to command large border armies, believing Li Linfu's assertion that non-Han generals were more likely to be personally loyal to Emperor Xuanzong himself and would not have clan entanglements, even though Li Linfu's own personal motivation was to prevent Han officials from going through the border command route to become chancellors, thus threatening him.<ref name=ZZTJ215>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377215|vol. 215]].</ref>  Such generals who rose in ranks included [[An Lushan]], [[An Sishun]], [[Geshu Han]], and [[Gao Xianzhi]].<ref name=ZZTJ214/><ref name=ZZTJ215/>  By 742, the main Tang forces were all concentrated on the border, at nine different military circuits and one special military district (Lingnan), as well as three special coast defense districts ([[Changle Commandery|Changle]], [[Donglai Commandery|Donglai]], and Dongmou):<ref name=ZZTJ215/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Its vassal [[Huige]] rose and became the dominant power of the region, but formally submitted to Tang as a vassal.<ref name=ZZTJ215/>\n\n[[Image:Ch'ien Hs\u00fcan 002.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Yang Yuhuan]] mounting a horse, by [[Qian Xuan]] (1235\u20131305)]]\nMeanwhile, after Consort Wu's death, Emperor Xuanzong had been depressed. When he saw his son Prince of Shou Li Mao's wife (his daughter-in-law) Yang Yuhuan (Princess of Shou, by virtue of marriage), he was infatuated with her, and he had her become a [[Taoist]] nun and gave Li Mao the wife of the general Wei Zhaoxun (\u97cb\u662d\u8a13) as his new wife and princess. Meanwhile, he secretly took the nun, Yang, into the palace. She became his [[Ranks of Imperial Consorts in China|senior-ranking concubine (''guifei'')]], known as Yang Guifei, and soon became so powerful that officials were bribing her family members to get preferential treatment. She was referred to inside the palace as \"the Lady\" and treated like an empress.<ref name=ZZTJ215/> He abducted more than 40000 women in his palace.<ref>''Old Book of Tang'', [[:zh:s:\u820a\u5510\u66f8/\u5377184|vol. 184]]</ref> Some were not set free even after they were over 60 years old.<ref>\u5143\u7a39, ''\u884c\u5bae''</ref><ref>\u767d\u5c45\u6613, ''\u4e0a\u967d\u767d\u9aee\u4eba''</ref><ref>[http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_471fa0c7010090rm.html \u4ece\u201c\u82b1\u9e1f\u4f7f\u201d\u8bf4\u8d77\uff08325\uff09_\u6167\u5fc3_\u65b0\u6d6a\u535a\u5ba2]</ref><ref>[http://www.cohss.fcu.edu.tw/wSite/public/Attachment/f1378100398875.pdf \u5973\u6027\uff0e\u5e1d\u738b\uff0e\u8ce6\u5bb6\uff1a \u5510\u300c\u7f8e\u9e97\u300d\u8ce6\u4e4b\u66f8\u5beb\u985e\u578b\u53ca\u5176\u6587\u5316\u610f\u860a]</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Li Linfu was beginning to conflict with Li Shizhi and Wei Jian, who were allies. Li Linfu, who engaged a group of secret police officials to investigate and manufacture evidence against political enemies, was able to get Wei and Li Shizhi demoted and exiled in 746.  (Li Shizhi was replaced by [[Chen Xilie]], who gained favor from Emperor Xuanzong for his knowledge in [[Taoism]] and sorcery.)  In 747, Li Linfu further carried out a campaign of terror against exiled officials, and among the officials executed were Wei, Li Yong (\u674e\u9095) and Pei Dunfu (\u88f4\u6566\u5fa9). Li Shizhi and Wang Ju, who had been instrumental in Emperor Xuanzong's initial actions against Princess Taiping, committed suicide.<ref name=ZZTJ215/>\n\nMeanwhile, in 747, Emperor Xuanzong wanted to expand the government's talent pool, and so issued an edict ordering that the people who had unusual talents to come to Chang'an to be examined by himself. Li Linfu, fearing that these examinees might accuse him of improprieties when they get to meet the emperor, suggested that these examinees go through two levels of preliminary examinations \u2013 by the local governments, and then by the executive bureau. As a result, no one passed the first two levels of preliminary examinations, and Li LInfu subsequently submitted a note to Emperor Xuanzong congratulating him that no talent has been overlooked by the imperial administration.<ref name=ZZTJ215/>\n\n[[Image:China, 742.svg|thumb|250px|right|Tang territories and [[History of the political divisions of China#Provinces under the Tang dynasty|Tang provinces]] by 742.]]\nMeanwhile, also as of 747, An Lushan had become greatly favored by Emperor Xuanzong due to his military achievements and his willingness to flatter Emperor Xuanzong, Consort Yang, and her family members. Further, Li Linfu, apprehensive about the general [[Wang Zhongsi]], who at that time was in command of four circuits (Hexi, Longyou, [[Shuofang]], and Hedong), deprecated Wang in favor of An Lushan. In 747, after Li Linfu implicated Wang in hindering a campaign against the Tibetan Empire and further accused Wang of plotting a coup to overthrow Emperor Xuanzong and replace him with Li Heng, Wang was arrested and demoted, escaping death only at the pleas of Geshu, who was Wang's deputy and who subsequently was given the commands of Hexi and Longyou. An Lushan, who had already been in command of Fanyang and Pinglu Circuits, was also given Hedong, and thereafter was in command of the most elite troops of the empire.<ref name=ZZTJ215/>  Meanwhile, the ethnically [[Goguryeo]] general Gao Xianzhi had become prominent in the Xiyu region, expanding Tang power to the west.<ref name=ZZTJ216>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377216|216]].</ref>\n\nBy 748, Consort Yang's cousins Yang Guozhong, Yang Xian (\u694a\u929b) and Yang Qi (\u694a\u9321), as well as her three sisters (who were created the Ladies of Han, Guo, and Qin), had become exceedingly wealthy and powerful due to the favors that Emperor Xuanzong showed them. It was said that their wealth topped all households in Chang'an. It was also said that by 749, the empire was so wealthy that Emperor Xuanzong viewed treasures as expendable and so awarded them without limit.<ref name=ZZTJ216/>\n\n====Late ''Tianbao'' era====\nMeanwhile, Li Linfu had a tight grip on power and favors from Emperor Xuanzong throughout the years, but as of 750, Yang Guozhong and Chen Xilie had allied with each other and were finding ways to eliminate Li Linfu's allies from government.<ref name=ZZTJ216/>\n\nAs of 751, Tang was also facing defeats on two different external fronts \u2013 as [[Kingdom of Nanzhao|Nanzhao]]'s king Geluofeng (\u95a4\u7f85\u9cf3), angry about unreasonable demands that the Zhang Qiantuo (\u5f35\u8654\u9640) the governor of Yunnan Commandery (\u96f2\u5357, roughly modern [[Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture]], [[Yunnan]]) and Zhang's subsequent false accusations that he was planning to rebel, rebelled for real, and attacked and occupied Yunnan Commandery. A major attack by the general Xianyu Zhongtong (\u9bae\u4e8e\u4ef2\u901a) against Nanzhao failed terribly in 751, and subsequent defeats by Tang forces eventually led to a total of some 200,000 casualties among Tang troops. On the western front, Gao Xianzhi suffered a major defeat at the Abbasid forces at the [[Battle of Talas]] in 751 as well, ending the Tang expansion to the west.<ref name=ZZTJ216/>\n\nIn 752, Wang Hong's brother Wang Han (\u738b\u92b2) was accused of treason after his associates rose in a failed coup at Chang'an. In the aftermaths, Wang Hong was forced to commit suicide, and Yang Guozhong, Chen, and Geshu Han further tried to implicate Li Linfu in the plot as well. After Li LInfu died in winter 752, Yang Guozhong succeeded him, and almost immediately accused Li LInfu of having been complicit in the rebellion of another general, Li Xianzhong (\u674e\u737b\u5fe0). Li LInfu was posthumously disgraced, and his family was exiled.<ref name=ZZTJ216/>\n\nA rivalry soon developed between Yang Guozhong and An Lushan, and Yang Guozhong began to repeatedly warn Emperor Xuanzong that An was plotting rebellion. Emperor Xuanzong ignored the warnings. In 754, Yang Guozhong suggested that if An were summoned to the capital, he would surely refuse, and Emperor Xuanzong decided to try An \u2013 and An arrived in Chang'an immediately after being summoned. After this incident, Emperor Xuanzong no longer believed that An was plotting rebellion. Nevertheless, because of Yang Guozhong's opposition, he did not make An chancellor, as he was planning. Also in 754, with Yang Guozhong also trying to squeeze Chen out of the government, Chen resigned and was replaced by [[Wei Jiansu]].<ref name=ZZTJ217>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377217|vol. 217]].</ref>\n\n[[Image:Kano Eitoku 007.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Xuanzong with Consort Yang on a terrace with their attendants, by Japanese artist [[Kan\u014d Eitoku]] (1543\u20131590)]]\nIn 755, Yang Guozhong further provoked An, who was then back at his post in Fanyang, by surrounding An's mansion at Chang'an and arresting and executing An's staff members. An, in fear and anger, rebelled in winter 755, and quickly reached and captured Luoyang after defeating [[Feng Changqing]]'s undersupplied army. Subsequently, Emperor Xuanzong, believing in reports from the eunuch Bian Lingcheng (\u908a\u4ee4\u8aa0) that Feng was cowardly and that Feng's superior Gao Xianzhi was corrupt, executed both Feng and Gao and replaced Gao with Geshu in defending [[Tong Pass]] from An's advances. An declared himself emperor of a new state of [[Yan (Anshi)|Yan]] at Luoyang, but with Geshu defending Tong Pass, An's advances stalled, while Tang forces commanded by [[Li Guangbi]] and [[Guo Ziyi]] made advances against An-controlled territory north of the [[Yellow River]].<ref name=ZZTJ217/>  Meanwhile, though, Yang Guozhong, fearing that Geshu had designs against him, convinced Emperor Xuanzong to order Geshu to attack despite Geshu's warnings that doing so was risky. Geshu was subsequently defeated by An's forward commander Cui Qianyou (\u5d14\u4e7e\u7950), and Tong Pass fell.

Meanwhile, without knowledge that Emperor Suzong had claimed the throne, Emperor Xuanzong, while still on his way to [[Chengdu]], the capital of Jiannan Circuit, issued an edict that gave several of his sons various responsibility areas, under Li Heng's command overall; until this edict was issued, most of the realm only knew that Chang'an had fallen and had not known where Emperor Xuanzong had fled.

For example, in spring 757, apparently without first consulting Emperor Suzong, he named [[Li Lin (Tang chancellor)|Li Lin]] chancellor, although he subsequently sent both Li Lin and another chancellor, [[Cui Yuan (705\u2013768)|Cui Yuan]], whom he had not sent to Emperor Suzong previously, to Emperor Suzong. He also posthumously honored Emperor Suzong's mother Consort Yang (not Yang Yuhuan) as an empress. Meanwhile, remembering Zhang Jiuling had previously warned about An Lushan, Emperor Xuanzong sent messengers to Zhang's tomb to offer sacrifices to him.<ref name=ZZTJ219>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377219|vol. 219]].</ref>\n\nLate in 757, Emperor Suzong, with aid from Huige, recaptured Chang'an from Yan, then ruled by An Lushan's son [[An Qingxu]], who had killed An Lushan earlier in 757 and taken over the throne himself. After Emperor Suzong recaptured Chang'an, he sent messengers to Emperor Xuanzong requesting that he return to Chang'an and offering the throne back to Emperor Xuanzong. Emperor Xuanzong, apprehensive of the offer, initially not only declined but further requested to remain in Jiannan. Only after Emperor Suzong, at the suggestion of his strategist [[Li Mi (chancellor)|Li Mi]], had the government officials make a joint submission to Emperor Xuanzong no longer mentioning the return of the throne, did Emperor Xuanzong agree to depart Jiannan to return to Chang'an.<ref name=ZZTJ220>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377220|vol. 220]].</ref>  On the way back to Chang'an, he had Gao Lishi try to dig up Consort Yang Yuhuan's body for reburial, but her body had already decomposed; only her fragrance bag remained.

For example, Emperor Suzong had wanted to spare Zhang Shuo's sons Zhang Jun (\u5f35\u5747) and Zhang Ji (\u5f35\u578d), who had previously submitted to An Lushan, because of Zhang Shuo's contributions and Zhang Jun's and Zhang Ji's prior efforts to protect him from Li Linfu's machinations, but Emperor Xuanzong deeply hated them for having surrendered to An, and at Emperor Xuanzong's insistence, Zhang Jun was executed, and Zhang Ji was exiled to Lingnan.<ref name=ZZTJ220/>\n\nMeanwhile, after a while, Emperor Xuanzong settled into a routine at Xingqing Palace, with Chen Xuanli and Gao Lishi attending to him. Also often attending to him were his daughter Li Chiying (\u674e\u6301\u76c8), the Princess Yuzhen, the lady in waiting Ru Xianyuan (\u5982\u4ed9\u5a9b), and the eunuchs Wang Cheng'en (\u738b\u627f\u6069) and Wei Yue (\u9b4f\u6085). The imperial musicians often played for him, and he often climbed up Changqing Tower (\u9577\u6176\u6a13) to receive well wishes from the populace. He also often held feasts for generals and people from Jiannan, with Li Chiying and Ru serving as hostesses. Meanwhile, though, Emperor Xuanzong's attendants looked down at the powerful eunuch [[Li Fuguo]], who had served Emperor Suzong throughout the campaign against Yan. To retaliate, Li Fuguo began to try to convince Emperor Suzong that Emperor Xuanzong and his attendants were plotting to seize power back. In 760, with Emperor Suzong's tacit, although not explicit, approval, on one occasion when Emperor Xuanzong was out riding, Li Fuguo intercepted him and forced him to move back to the main palace. Even on that occasion, however, Gao would not submit to Li Fuguo, and even yelled at Li Fuguo to force him to get off his horse and to escort Emperor Xuanzong on foot, along with Gao.

His reign of 43 years was the longest during the Tang dynasty. In the early half of his reign he was a diligent and astute ruler. Ably assisted by capable chancellors like [[Yao Chong]], [[Song Jing]] and [[Zhang Yue (Tang dynasty)|Zhang Yue]], he was credited with bringing Tang China to a pinnacle of culture and power. Emperor Xuanzong, however, was blamed for over-trusting [[Li Linfu]], [[Yang Guozhong]] and [[An Lushan]] during his late reign, with Tang's [[golden age]] ending in the [[An Lushan Rebellion|An-Shi Rebellion]].<ref>See, e.g., ''[[Bo Yang]] Edition of the [[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', vol. 52, preface.</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|List of family of Wu Zetian}}\nLi Longji was born at the [[Tang dynasty]] eastern capital [[Luoyang]] in 685, during the first reign of his father [[Emperor Ruizong of Tang|Emperor Ruizong]] (Li Dan) \u2013 but at that time, Emperor Ruizong's mother [[Wu Zetian|Empress Dowager Wu]] (later known as Wu Zetian), not Emperor Ruizong, was in actual control of power as [[empress dowager]] and [[regent]]. Li Longji was the third son of Emperor Ruizong, and his mother was Emperor Ruizong's [[concubine]] Consort Dou, who was highly ranked. In 687, as the emperor's son, he was created the Prince of Chu. It was said that he was handsome as a child, and was talented in music.<ref name=BT8>''[[Old Book of Tang]]'', [[:zh:s:\u820a\u5510\u66f8/\u53778|vol. 8]].</ref>  He had two older brothers \u2013 [[Li Chengqi]], born of Emperor Ruizong's wife [[Empress Liu (Tang dynasty)|Empress Liu]], and Li Chengyi (\u674e\u6210\u7fa9), as well as three younger brothers \u2013 Li Longfan (\u674e\u9686\u7bc4), Li Longye (\u674e\u9686\u696d), and Li Longti (\u674e\u9686\u608c). He had two full younger sisters, Princess Jinxian (\u91d1\u4ed9\u516c\u4e3b) and Princess Yuzhen (\u7389\u771f\u516c\u4e3b), who later became Taoist nuns.<ref>''[[New Book of Tang]]'', [[:zh:s:\u65b0\u5510\u66f8/\u5377081|vol. 81]].</ref>\n\n==During Wu Zetian's reign==\nIn 690, Dowager Empress Wu had her son Emperor Ruizong yield the throne to her, and she took the throne as [[queen regnant|empress regnant]] of a new [[Zhou dynasty (690\u2013705)|Zhou dynasty]], interrupting Tang. She imposed upon Ruizong and his family the surname Wu (\u6b66) to match hers.<ref name=jts_90 /> In 692, Li Longji and his brothers were allowed to have residences outside the palace and were given staffs at their mansions.<ref name=BT8/>  In 693, both his mother Consort Dou and Li Dan's wife [[Empress Liu (Tang dynasty)|Crown Princess Liu]] (Li Dan's having been reduced to [[crown prince]] rank at that point) were killed by Wu Zetian inside the palace after Wu Zetian's [[lady-in-waiting]] Wei Tuan'er (\u97cb\u5718\u5152) falsely accused them of using witchcraft against Wu Zetian \u2013 and not even their bodies were recovered.<ref name=ZZTJ205>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377205|vol. 205]].</ref>  Subsequently, all of Li Dan's sons were reduced in title, and Li Longji's title was reduced to Prince of Linzi. He and his brothers, along with their cousins Li Guangshun (\u674e\u5149\u9806) the Prince of Yifeng, [[Li Shouli]] the Prince of Yong, and Li Shouyi (\u674e\u5b88\u7fa9) the Prince of Yong'an (the sons of their uncle [[Li Xian (prince)|Li Xi\u00e1n]], formerly crown prince but who had been forced by Wu Zetian to commit suicide in 684), were kept inside the palace and not allowed to have contact with outsiders<ref name=ZZTJ204>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377204|vol. 204]],</ref> until 699, when they were allowed to leave the palace and take up residences outside.<ref name=ZZTJ206>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377206|vol. 206]].</ref>\n\n==During Emperor Zhongzong's second reign==\nIn 705, Wu Zetian was overthrown in a coup, and Li Longji's uncle [[Emperor Zhongzong of Tang|Li Xi\u0103n]] (note different person than the father of Li Guangshun, Li Shouli, and Li Shouyi), who was at that time crown prince (Li Dan having yielded that title to him in 698 and taken the title of Prince of Xiang), who had been briefly emperor prior to Li Dan, returned to the throne (as Emperor Zhongzong). Li Longji was made the deputy minister of military supplies (\u885b\u5c09\u5c11\u537f, ''Weiwei Shaoqing''). In 708, he was made the secretary general of Lu Prefecture (\u6f5e\u5dde, roughly modern [[Changzhi]], [[Shanxi]]). In 710, he was recalled to the capital [[Chang'an]] to attend to Emperor Zhongzong when Emperor Zhongzong was sacrificing to heaven and earth. Meanwhile, sorcerers engaged by Emperor Zhongzong believed that there was an aura of an emperor at the area of Chang'an where the mansions Li Longji and his uncles were, and Emperor Zhongzong tried to fulfill the vision by visiting Li Longji's mansion and attending a feast there.<ref name=BT8/>  While Li Longji was back in Chang'an, he spent time to cultivate relationships with imperial guard commanders, as he believed that Emperor Zhongzong's powerful wife [[Empress Wei (Tang dynasty)|Empress Wei]] would bring harm to the Tang dynasty.<ref name=ZZTJ209>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377209|vol. 209]].</ref>\n\n==Coup against Empress Dowager Wei==\nIn summer 710, Emperor Zhongzong died suddenly\u2014a death that traditional historians believed to be a poisoning by Empress Wei and her daughter Li Guo'er the [[Princess Anle]] so that Empress Wei could become \"emperor\" like Wu Zetian and Li Guo'er could become crown princess. For the time being, Emperor Zhongzong's son by a concubine, [[Emperor Shang of Tang|Li Chongmao]] the Prince of Wen, was named emperor (as Emperor Shang), but Empress Wei retained actual power as empress dowager and regent. Originally, Empress Dowager Wei's clan members, along with Zong, Li Guo'er's husband Wu Yanxiu, and other officials Zhao L\u00fcwen (\u8d99\u5c65\u6eab) and Ye Jingneng (\u8449\u975c\u80fd) were advising her to take the throne, like Wu Zetian did, and they also advised her to eliminate Li Dan and Princess Taiping. The official [[Cui Riyong]] leaked their plan to Li Longji. Li Longji responded by conspiring with Princess Taiping, Princess Taiping's son Xue Chongjian (\u859b\u5d07\u7c21), as well as several low level officials close to him\u2014[[Zhong Shaojing]], Wang Chongye (\u738b\u5d07\u66c4), [[Liu Youqiu]], and Ma Sizong (\u9ebb\u55e3\u5b97)\u2014to act first. Meanwhile, Empress Wei's nephews Wei Bo (\u97cb\u64ad) and Gao Song (\u9ad8\u5d69), who had recently been put in command of imperial guards and who had tried to establish their authority by dealing with the guards harshly, had alienated the guards, and the guard officers Ge Fushun (\u845b\u798f\u9806), [[Chen Xuanli]] (\u9673\u7384\u79ae), and Li Xianfu (\u674e\u4ed9\u9ce7) thereafter also joined the plot.<ref name=ZZTJ209/>\n\nWithout first informing Li Dan, the conspirators rose on 21 July, first killing Wei Bo, Gao, and Empress Wei's cousin Wei Gui (\u97cb\u74bf). They then attacked the palace. When Empress Dowager Wei panicked and fled to an imperial guard camp, a guard beheaded her. Li Guo'er, Wu Yanxiu, and Lady Helou were killed as well. Li Longji soon slaughtered a number of officials in Empress Dowager's faction as well as her clan, while displaying Empress Dowager Wei's body on the street. At the urging of Princess Taiping, Li Longji, and Li Longji's brother Li Chengqi, Li Dan soon took the throne from Li Chongmao and again became emperor (as Emperor Ruizong).<ref name=ZZTJ209/>\n\n==During Emperor Ruizong's second reign==\nEmperor Ruizong was immediately faced with the issue of whom to make crown prince\u2014as Li Chengqi, as the oldest son overall and the oldest son of his wife, was the appropriate heir under [[Confucian]] principles of succession, but Li Longji had been the one whose accomplishments had allowed him to retake the throne. He hesitated. Li Chengqi declined consideration to be crown prince\u2014stating to his father:\n\n{{quote|If the state were secure, then consideration should be first given to the oldest son of the wife. If the state were in danger, then consideration should be first given for achievement. If you did not follow this principle, the people of the entire empire will be disappointed. I would rather die than to be placed above the Prince of Ping [(i.e., Li Longji, whose title had been changed to Prince of Ping by this point)].}}\n\nLi Chengqi wept and begged to yield for several days, and after further persuasion by the [[Chancellor of the Tang dynasty|chancellor]] [[Liu Youqiu]]\u2014who had been part of Li Longji's coup plans\u2014Emperor Ruizong agreed, and created Li Longji crown prince. Li Longji submitted a petition offering to yield to Li Chengqi, but Emperor Ruizong rejected it.<ref name=ZZTJ209/>\n\nInitially, Princess Taiping agreed to Li Longji's ascension as crown prince despite the fact that Li Longji was not Emperor Ruizong's oldest son and was not born of Emperor Ruizong's wife Empress Liu (Li Chengqi was both\u2014and therefore pursuant to Confucian principles of succession should have been crown prince) as she believed that Li Longji was young (25 at the time he was made crown prince) and would be easy to control. However, once she began to see that Li Longji was strong-willed, she became apprehensive and often had officials close to her publicly opine that Li Longji was an improper crown prince. She further often paid Li Longji's staff members to spy on him to try to find faults with him. She associated with a group of officials, including the chancellors [[Dou Huaizhen]], [[Xiao Zhizhong]], and [[Cen Xi]], intending to find some way to remove Li Longji, but was unable to get two other chancellors\u2014[[Wei Anshi]] and [[Song Jing]]\u2014to join her group.<ref name=ZZTJ210>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377210|vol. 210]].</ref>\n\nIn 711, Song and another chancellor, [[Yao Chong|Yao Yuanzhi]], tried to persuade Emperor Ruizong to carry out a plan that they believed would end her plotting. They proposed that the two princes who arguably had superior claims on the throne than Li Longji\u2014Li Chengqi and Li Shouli (whose father [[Li Xian (prince)|Li Xian]] (note different character than Emperor Zhongzong) was an older brother to both Emperors Zhongzong and Ruizong)\u2014be sent out of the capital [[Chang'an]] to serve as prefectural prefects, while Princess Taiping and Wu Youji be sent to live in Luoyang. They also proposed that Li Longji be put in charge of most affairs of state. Emperor Ruizong initially agreed and made the orders as Song and Yao suggested, except that he believed that Luoyang was too far and therefore sent Princess Taiping and Wu Youji only to Pu Prefecture (\u84b2\u5dde, roughly modern [[Yuncheng]], [[Shanxi]]). After Princess Taiping found out that the plan was conceived by Song and Yao, however, she was incensed and let Li Longji know her anger. In fear, Li Longji submitted a petition accusing Song and Yao of alienating him from his brothers Li Chengqi and Li Shouli (who was actually a cousin but was raised with Emperor Ruizong's sons) and aunt Princess Taiping, asking that the two be put to death. Emperor Ruizong, in response, demoted Song and Yao and recalled Princess Taiping, Li Chengqi, and Li Shouli to the capital. In the aftermaths, Li Longji submitted another request to yield the crown prince position to Li Chengqi, but Emperor Ruizong declined it. Also in 711, Emperor Ruizong posthumously honored both Empress Liu and Li Longji's mother Consort Dou as empresses and built a temple for them to be worshipped, but was unable to locate their bodies for reburial, and therefore had to give them a ceremonial reburial without the bodies. Emperor Ruizong also ordered that all minor matters be decided by Li Longji.<ref name=ZZTJ210/>\n\nIn 712, Princess Taiping had astrologers warn Emperor Ruizong that the constellation that symbolized the imperial throne, ''Dizuo'' (\u5e1d\u5ea7), showed that there would be a change in the emperor's position\u2014believing that Emperor Ruizong would suspect Li Longji of plotting a coup and that she could remove Li Longji this way. Instead, Emperor Ruizong, reasoning that the change in the emperor's position could be accounted by an orderly transition, offered to pass the throne to Li Longji. Princess Taiping fervently opposed it, and Li Longji initially declined, but at Emperor Ruizong's insistence finally accepted and took the throne on 8 September<ref name=Ascension/> (as Emperor Xuanzong). However, at Princess Taiping's suggestion, Emperor Ruizong retained much of the imperial power as ''[[Taishang Huang]]'' (retired emperor), and his edicts continued to carry greater force than Emperor Xuanzong's.<ref name=ZZTJ210/>\n\n==As emperor==\n\n===''Xiantian'' era (712\u2013713)===\n[[Image:Meister des Tributpferdes 001.jpg|thumb|right|240px|''A Tributary Horse for Emperor Xuanzong'', painted in the 12th century during the subsequent [[Song dynasty]]]]\n\nEmperor Xuanzong made his wife [[Empress Wang (Xuanzong)|Crown Princess Wang]] empress. Meanwhile, Princess Taiping continued to be highly influential in governmental matters through Emperor Ruizong, and most chancellors were her associates.  (Of the seven chancellors at the time, five \u2013 Dou Huaizhen, Xiao Zhizhong, Cen Xi, [[Cui Shi]], and [[Lu Xiangxian]] \u2013 were made chancellors at her recommendation, although Lu was not considered a member of her party.)  Liu Youqiu and the general Zhang Wei (\u5f35\u6690), with Emperor Xuanzong's approval, planned to mobilize the imperial guards to kill several of those chancellors \u2013 [[Dou Huaizhen]], [[Cui Shi]] and [[Cen Xi]]. However, after Zhang told the plan to the imperial censor Deng Guangbin (\u9127\u5149\u8cd3), the news was leaked. Liu was arrested, and initially set to be executed. Emperor Xuanzong interceded on his behalf with Emperor Ruizong, and Liu, Zhang, and Deng were spared but exiled.<ref name=ZZTJ210/>\n\nLater in 712, Emperor Ruizong decreed that Emperor Xuanzong lead a group of soldiers to examine the northern border. However, the group of conscripted soldiers was disbanded in spring 713, and the plan was never carried out.<ref name=ZZTJ210/>\n\nBy summer 713, it was said that Princesses Taiping, Dou, Cen, Xiao, Cui; along with other officials [[Xue Ji]], Li Jin (\u674e\u6649) the Prince of Xinxing (a grandson of Li Deliang (\u674e\u5fb7\u826f), a cousin of Tang's founder [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang|Emperor Gaozu]]), Li You (\u674e\u7337), Jia Yingfu (\u8cc8\u81ba\u798f), Tang Jun (\u5510\u6659); the generals Chang Yuankai (\u5e38\u5143\u6977), Li Ci (\u674e\u6148), and Li Qin (\u674e\u6b3d); and the monk Huifan, were plotting to overthrow Emperor Xuanzong. It was further said that they discussed, with the lady in waiting Lady Yuan to poison the ''[[gastrodia elata]]'' that Emperor Xuanzong routinely took as an aphrodisiac. When this alleged plot was reported to Emperor Xuanzong by [[Wei Zhigu]], Emperor Xuanzong, who had already received advice from Wang Ju (\u738b\u741a), [[Zhang Yue (Tang dynasty)|Zhang Shuo]], and [[Cui Riyong]] to act first, did so. He convened a meeting with his brothers Li Longfan the Prince of Qi and Li Longye the Prince of Xue (who had changed their names to Li Fan and Li Ye by this point to observe [[naming taboo]] for Emperor Xuanzong), [[Guo Yuanzhen]], along with a number of his associates \u2014 the general Wang Maozhong (\u738b\u6bdb\u4ef2), the officials Jiang Jiao (\u59dc\u768e) and Li Lingwen (\u674e\u4ee4\u554f), his brother-in-law Wang Shouyi (\u738b\u5b88\u4e00), the [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]] [[Gao Lishi]], and the military officer Li Shoude (\u674e\u5b88\u5fb7)\u2014and decided to act first.

Then, Jia, Li You, Xiao, and Cen were arrested and executed as well. Dou fled into a canyon and committed suicide by hanging. Xue Ji was forced to commit suicide. When Emperor Ruizong heard about this, he quickly ascended the tower at Chengtian Gate (\u627f\u5929\u9580) to ascertain what was happening. Guo reported to him Emperor Xuanzong's intentions, and Emperor Ruizong felt compelled to affirm Emperor Xuanzong's actions in an edict. The next day, Emperor Ruizong issued an edict transferring all authorities to Emperor Xuanzong and moved to a secondary palace, Baifu Hall (\u767e\u798f\u6bbf) and would remain there until his death in 716.<ref name=ZZTJ210/><ref name=ZZTJ211>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377211|vol. 211]].</ref>\n\n===''Kaiyuan'' era (713\u2013741)===\nEmperor Xuanzong's ''Kaiyuan'' era is usually viewed as one of the golden ages of Chinese history \u2013 a period of political stability, peace in society, and economic prosperity, in addition to advances in education, literature, music, painting, sculpture, and religion.<ref>See, e.g., ''Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian'', vol. 51, Preface.</ref>\n\n====Early ''Kaiyuan'' era====\n[[Image:Spring Outing of the Tang Court.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Spring Outing of the Tang Court'', by Xuanzong era artist [[Zhang Xuan]], 8th century original]]\nMeanwhile, [[Zhang Yue (Tang dynasty)|Zhang Yue]] and Liu Youqiu served as chancellors, but they were soon displaced by Yao Yuanzhi (who then changed his name to [[Yao Chong]]) and [[Lu Huaishen]]. Changing the system of having a large group of chancellors simultaneous, as had been the case throughout Tang, Emperor Xuanzong reduced the numbers to two (or sometimes three) for the rest of his reign.<ref>''New Book of Tang'', [[:zh:s:\u65b0\u5510\u66f8/\u5377062|vol. 62]].</ref>  Yao was considered a highly capable administrator, and with him ruling on most important matters and Lu assisting, the government was said to be highly efficient.<ref name=ZZTJ211/>\n\nIn 714, Emperor Xuanzong carried out a series of political reprisals against the cruel secret police officials of Wu Zetian's reign, exiling the ones that were still alive and eventually barring their descendants from holding political offices. At the urging of Jiang Jiao's brother Jiang Hui ({{lang|zh|\u59dc\u8aa8}}), he also exiled a number of chancellors \u2013 [[Wei Sili]], [[Wei Anshi]], [[Zhao Yanzhao]], and [[Li Jiao (Tang dynasty)|Li Jiao]] \u2013 from Emperor Zhongzong's reign whom Jiang accused of being unable to curb Empress Wei's abuse of power.<ref name=ZZTJ211/>\n\nAlso in 714, Emperor Xuanzong, wanting to punish the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] and the [[Kumo Xi|Xi]] for having defeated Tang forces during Emperor Zhongzong's reign, commissioned the general [[Xue Ne]] to attack them, but Xue suffered another devastating loss to them, at the casualty rate of 80\u201390%. However, later in the year, when the [[Tibetan Empire]] attacked, Emperor Xuanzong again commissioned Xue to defend against the attack, and Xue was able to repel the Tibetan forces. Subsequently, though, although both sides tried to invoke the marriage between Li Shouli's daughter Princess Jincheng and [[Me Agtsom]], emperor of the Tibetan Empire, in seeking peace, the two sides could not reach an agreement and remained in border conflict yearly. In response, Emperor Xuanzong established the office of ''[[jiedushi]]'' (military governor) of Longyou Circuit ({{lang|zh|\u96b4\u53f3}}, headquartered in what is now [[Haidong]], [[Qinghai]]), with a centralized command of 12 prefectures under a single military general.<ref name=ZZTJ211/>  Eventually, the establishment of ''jiedushi'' would be extended to other parts of the empire.<ref>Bo Yang, ''Outlines of the History of the Chinese'' ({{lang|zh|\u4e2d\u570b\u4eba\u53f2\u7db1}}), vol. 2, pp. 544\u2013546.</ref>\n\nAlso in 714, Emperor Xuanzong created [[Li Ying (prince)|Li Siqian]], his second son and the son of his then-favorite concubine Consort Zhao, crown prince.  (Emperor Xuanzong's wife Empress Wang was sonless.)<ref name=ZZTJ211/>\n\nMeanwhile, the Tang relationship with [[Qapaghan Qaghan]] of the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks]] had fluctuated during the first few years of the ''Kaiyuan'' era, as minor hostilities occurred at the borders as well as contests over vassals' loyalty for the two states, but they were also at times friendly to each other, with Qapaghan requesting at times to marry a Tang princess and Emperor Xuanzong agreeing to the proposal. In 716, however, Qapaghan was killed in battle against the Bayegu ({{lang|zh|\u62d4\u91ce\u53e4}}), and from that point on, lacking his efficient leadership, the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks, while remaining an important regional power, posed much less of a threat to China,<ref name=ZZTJ211/> although at times still capable of dealing serious defeats to Tang forces, as was the case in 720 when the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk general [[Tonyukuk]] defeated the Tang garrison at Liang Prefecture (\u6dbc\u5dde, roughly modern [[Wuwei, Gansu|Wuwei]], [[Gansu]]) and the Tang vassal [[Basmyl]].<ref name=ZZTJ212>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377212|vol. 212]].</ref>  Meanwhile, Tang, the Tibetan Empire, and the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] were constantly engaging in a three-way tug of war for influence in the [[Western Regions|Xiyu]] (i.e., modern [[Xinjiang]] and former Soviet [[Central Asia]]) region. In 715, for example, when the king of Bahanna ({{lang|zh|\u62d4\u6c57\u90a3}}) was expelled by a new king supported by the Tibetan Empire and the Umayyad Caliphate, Tang forces commanded by the general {{Interlanguage link multi|Zhang Xiaosong|2=zh|3=\u5f20\u5b5d\u5d69|preserve=1}} ({{lang|zh|\u5f35\u5b5d\u5d69}}) attacked the new king and restored the old king.<ref name=ZZTJ211/> General Tang Jiahui led the Chinese to defeat the following Arab-Tibetan attack in the [[Battle of Aksu (717)]].<ref name=\"Guides2017\">{{cite book|author=Insight Guides|title=Insight Guides Silk Road|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X4mPDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT120&dq=715+Alutar+Ikhshid&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiI3vzSqf7ZAhXMUlAKHT9hDJkQ6AEIJzAA|date=1 April 2017|publisher=APA|isbn=978-1-78671-699-6|pages=}}</ref> The attack on Aksu was joined by [[Turgesh]] Khan [[Suluk (Turgesh khagan)|Suluk]].<ref name=\"Grousset1970\">{{cite book|author=Ren\u00e9 Grousset|title=The Empire of the Steppes: A History of Central Asia|url=https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppes00grou|url-access=registration|quote=aksu 717.|year=1970|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-1304-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppes00grou/page/114 114]\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Skaff2012\">{{cite book|author=Jonathan Karam Skaff|title=Sui-Tang China and Its Turko-Mongol Neighbors: Culture, Power, and Connections, 580-800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jrv-6_U5gfwC&pg=PA311&dq=aksu+717&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjFwZy0qP7ZAhUDb1AKHfnVD-EQ6AEILzAB|date=6 August 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-999627-8|pages=311\u2013}}</ref> Both [[Uqturpan County|Uch Turfan]] and [[Aksu City|Aksu]] were attacked by the Turgesh, Arab, and Tibetan force on 15 August 717.

At Yao's suggestion, Emperor Xuanzong ordered an extensive campaign of extermination, which was said to reduce the impact of the infestation and ward off a major [[famine]]. Later in 716, however, due a corruption scandal involving Yao's sons and his associate Zhao Hui ({{lang|zh|\u8d99\u8aa8}}), Yao incurred displeasure from Emperor Xuanzong and offered to resign. He and [[Yuan Qianyao]], who replaced Lu after Lu's death earlier in 716, were removed from their offices and replaced with [[Song Jing]] and [[Su Ting]], with Song making more of the important decisions and Su assisting.  Yao would not return to the chancellorship, but would remain influential as a key advisor for Emperor Xuanzong until Yao's death in 721.  Contrary to the practical and flexible Yao, Song was more interested in emphasizing integrity and rule of law in governance, and it was said that while Yao's and Song's emphases were different, they were both regarded as instrumental in establishing the rule of ''Kaiyuan'' and that subsequent chancellors could not compare to them.<ref name=ZZTJ211/>\n\nMeanwhile, Song and Su had carried out a stern campaign against the use of coins that were not officially forged by the government, which brought popular resentment that Emperor Xuanzong found problematic. In 720, he removed Song and Su from chancellor offices and replaced them with Yuan and [[Zhang Jiazhen]], and in 721 added Zhang Yue as a chancellor as well.<ref name=ZZTJ212/>\n\nMeanwhile, by 722, Empress Wang, who had contributed to Emperor Xuanzong's reign by providing suggestions, had begun to lose favor to [[Consort Wu]], a great-grandniece of Emperor Xuanzong's grandmother Wu Zetian. Emperor Xuanzong secretly discussed with Jiang Jiao the possibility of deposing her, but Jiang Jiao careless leaked the discussion. At the urging of Zhang Jiazhen, who was friendly with Empress Wang's brother Wang Shouyi (\u738b\u5b88\u4e00), advocated that Jiang Jiao be punished and exiled, and Jiang died in exile.\n\nMeanwhile, at Zhang Yue's suggestion, the Tang northern border defense forces, which had about 600,000 men at that time, was reduced by 200,000 men to allow the soldiers to return home. Further, seeing that the Tang conscription system, due to abuses against the soldiers at the time, was near a collapse, as the soldiers were forced into long tours of duty but their families were not exempt from taxes, thus causing great numbers of desertions, Zhang suggested a switch to a recruitment-based system where soldiers were paid salaries. This allowed, for a time, Tang's soldier supply to be replenished.  (Some later historians condemned Zhang for the abolition of the conscription system, believing the abolition to be the root of Tang's later fracturing, but some others, such as the modern historian [[Bo Yang]], argued that Zhang's actions not only were necessary to restore the supply of soldiers but saved many lives.<ref>See, e.g., ''Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian'', vol. 51, 722.</ref>)\n\n====Middle ''Kaiyuan'' era====\n[[Image:Audience by Emperor Tang Xuanzong.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Emperor Xuanzong giving audience to [[Elder Zhang Guo|Zhang Guo]], by [[Ren Renfa]] (1254\u20131327)]]\nIn 723, Zhang Jiazhen was demoted on account of a corruption scandal involving his brother Zhang Jiayou (\u5f35\u5609\u7950). His position was filled by [[Wang Jun (Tang chancellor)|Wang Jun]], who was soon himself demoted over suspicions, never proven, that he was plotting treason.<ref>''Old Book of Tang'', [[:zh:s:\u820a\u5510\u66f8/\u537793|vol. 93]].</ref>  With Zhang Yue thus effectively being the senior chancellor, Zhang Yue promoted literary studies, which Emperor Xuanzong also favored. In 724, he also commissioned the chief imperial astronomer Nangong Shuo (\u5357\u5bae\u8aaa) to carry out a major astronomical survey to observe the sun and the [[North Star]] at various points of the empire.<ref name=ZZTJ212/>\n\nAlso in 724, it was discovered that Wang Shouyi had engaged sorcerers to make amulets for Empress Wang to wear, hoping that the use of magic would allow her to have a son. Empress Wang was deposed and reduced to commoner rank, while Wang Shouyi was exiled and subsequently ordered to commit suicide in exile. Empress Wang died later in the year, and it was said that the eunuchs and the ladies in waiting mourned her bitterly and Emperor Xuanzong much regretted his treatment of her.<ref name=ZZTJ212/>  Still, after Empress Wang's removal and death, Consort Wu became undisputed mistress of the palace and was treated inside the palace like an empress would be. Still, in 726, when Emperor Xuanzong considered creating her empress, he encountered oppositions from officials on two grounds \u2013 that her Wu clan was hated by the people and that as she had her own sons, the position of Li Siqian the Crown Prince (whose name had been changed to Li Hong by this point) would be threatened. As a result, Emperor Xuanzong never created her empress.<ref name=ZZTJ213>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377213|vol. 213]].</ref>\n\nIn winter 725, Emperor Xuanzong, at Zhang Yue's urging, carried out a magnificent ceremony at [[Mount Tai]] to offer sacrifices to heaven and earth.<ref name=ZZTJ212/>\n\nIn 726, Zhang Yue was accused of corruption by several officials that he had blocked the advances of \u2013 Cui Yinfu (\u5d14\u96b1\u752b), [[Yuwen Rong]], and [[Li Linfu]] \u2013 and was found to have committed corruption. At the intercession of [[Gao Lishi]], however, Zhang Yue was removed only from his chancellor post and permitted to maintain his title and a number of other posts. He was replaced by [[Li Yuanhong (Tang chancellor)|Li Yuanhong]], and subsequently, [[Du Xian (Tang dynasty)|Du Xian]] was also added as a chancellor.<ref name=ZZTJ213/>\n\nIn 727, at the suggestion of the general Wang Junchuo (\u738b\u541b\u369f), Emperor Xuanzong commissioned Wang Junchuo to attack the Tibetan Empire, and after a Tibetan incursion in late 726, Wang counterattacked and inflicted losses on Tibetan forces commanded by the general Xinuoluogonglu (\u6089\u8afe\u908f\u606d\u797f). Later in the year, though, Xinuoluogonglu and another general, Zhulongmangbuzhi (\u71ed\u9f8d\u83bd\u5e03\u652f) attacked and captured Wang's home prefecture Gua Prefecture (\u74dc\u5dde, roughly modern [[Jiuquan]], [[Gansu]]), taking Wang's father Wang Shou (\u738b\u58fd) captive. As a result, Wang Junchuo did not dare to counterattack, and subsequently blamed the defeat on a number of tribal chiefs in the area and had them exiles. In response, Yaoluoge Hushu (\u85e5\u7f85\u845b\u8b77\u8f38), the nephew of one of the chiefs so exiled, Yaoluoge Chengzong (\u85e5\u7f85\u845b\u627f\u5b97), ambushed Wang Junchuo and killed him, and while Yaoluoge Hushu was forced to flee thereafter, for several years Tang did not engage in any offensive campaigns in the region.<ref name=ZZTJ213/>\n\nAround the same time, Emperor Xuanzong began to build a residential complex in the palace for imperial clan members, known as the Mansion of the Ten Princes (\u5341\u738b\u9662), to centralize their residence. Thereafter, imperial princes, including the crown prince, would rarely live outside the palace complex.<ref name=ZZTJ213/>\n\nIn 728, Emperor Xuanzong added the general [[Xiao Song]] as a chancellor. Subsequently, in 729, with Yuan, even though he was senior chancellor, unable to curb the disputes between Li Yuanhong and Du, Emperor Xuanzong removed all three from chancellor positions, promoting Yuwen and [[Pei Guangting]] to be chancellors in their stead \u2013 in Yuwen's case, for his abilities to find ways to add to the imperial treasury by imposing special taxes and levies. Later in the year, though, Yuwen made false accusations against the general Li Hui (\u674e\u8918) the Prince of Xin'an (Emperor Xuanzong's second cousin) and was exiled, and subsequently died in exile. Still, it was said that it was starting from Yuwen's times that Emperor Xuanzong began to pay attention on taxes to replenish the imperial treasury, which traditional historians viewed as the start of his inflicting financial burdens on the people. Further, with Pei in charge of the civil service system, it was said that due to Pei's strict adherence to seniority, the Tang civil service system began to lose its ability to find talented people to serve in offices.<ref name=ZZTJ213/>\n\nIn 730, the Khitan general Ketugan (\u53ef\u7a81\u5e72) killed the king Li Shaogu (\u674e\u90b5\u56fa) and took over the reign of the Khitan and the Xi personally, forcing the king of the Xi, Li Lusu (\u674e\u9b6f\u8607) to flee to Tang for protection. Tang sent an army to attack the Khitan, but meanwhile made peace with the Tibetan Empire. Initially, the campaign against the Khitan did not succeed, but in 732, with Li Hui in command, Tang forces dealt Ketugan a serious defeat and causing many of Ketugan's subordinates to defect and submit to Tang, although Ketugan was not captured.\n\n====Late ''Kaiyuan'' era====\n[[Image:Li Zhao Dao Tang Ming Huang to Shu.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Xuanzong's Journey to Shu'', in the manner of the mid 8th century Tang artist Li Zhaodao, an 11th-century [[Song dynasty]] remake]]\nMeanwhile, Tang also began to have periodic conflicts with [[Balhae]], and in 733 Emperor Xuanzong tried to commission [[Dae Mun-ye]] (\u5927\u9580\u85dd), the brother of Balhae's [[Mu of Balhae|King Mu]], to attack Balhae, along with forces from [[Silla]], but the attack was not successful.<ref name=ZZTJ213/>\n\nAlso in 733, Pei Guangting died, and at the recommendation of Xiao Song, he was replaced with [[Han Xiu]], but soon, Song and Han were in repeated conflicts, and late in 733, both were removed and replaced with [[Pei Yaoqing]], who became known for improving the food distribution system, and [[Zhang Jiuling]], known for his integrity.<ref name=ZZTJ213/><ref name=ZZTJ214>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377214|vol. 214]].</ref>  In 734, Emperor Xuanzong added [[Li Linfu]], a close associate of Consort Wu, as a chancellor as well.<ref name=ZZTJ214/>\n\nAround the new year 735, Ketuhan was killed in an internal Khitan power struggle, and Khitan became a vassal again, although it would not stay so permanently.<ref name=ZZTJ214/>\n\nBy 736, Emperor Xuanzong was described as having been tired of important affairs of state and beginning to become wasteful and exuberant in his lifestyle. Zhang tried to curb his behavior but thus began to lose favor, while Li Linfu was gaining power due to his association with Consort Wu. Further, Zhang supported Li Hong (whose name had been changed to Li Ying by this point), while Li Linfu and Consort Wu supported her son Li Mao (\u674e\u7441) the Prince of Shou and tried to have Li Mao made crown prince. In 736, due to Li Linfu's machinations that made Emperor Xuanzong believed that Zhang and Pei Yaoqing were improperly engaging in factionalism, Zhang and Pei Yaoqing were removed and replaced by [[Niu Xianke]], who closely followed Li Linfu's will, and thereafter, Li Linfu would dominate the imperial government almost to the end of Emperor Xuanzong's reign. Li Linfu did all he could to stay in power, and carried out many dirty tricks against actual or potential threats to his power. He also severely discouraged criticism, ending the relative freedom that officials had to make proposals to Emperor Xuanzong. This was often viewed by traditional historians as the turning point of Emperor Xuanzong's reign, which up to that point was considered a golden age in Chinese history, toward a path of degeneration. The [[Song dynasty]] historian [[Sima Guang]], in his ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', for example, commented:<ref name=ZZTJ214/>\n\n{{quote|Of the chancellors that the Emperor commissioned after he took the throne, Yao Chong emphasized flexibility, Song Jing emphasized the rule of law, Zhang Jiazhen emphasized administrative abilities, Zhang Shuo emphasized literary talent, Li Yuanhong and Du Xian emphasized frugality, and Han Xiu and Zhang Jiuling emphasized honesty. All of them had their different talents. After Zhang Jiuling was demoted, however, the officials were all concerned about keeping their positions, and honest words no longer had a place in government.}}\n\nIn 737, with Zhang no longer in the government to protect him, Li Ying was deposed and subsequently forced to commit suicide. However, with Consort Wu dying later in the year, Emperor Xuanzong did not immediately accept Li Linfu's proposal to have Li Mao made crown prince. Rather, he chose an older son, [[Emperor Suzong of Tang|Li Yu]] the Prince of Zhong, in 738.\n\n===''Tianbao'' era (742\u2013756)===\n[[Image:Emperor Minghuang's Journey to Sichuan, Freer Gallery of Art.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Emperor Xuanzong's Journey to Sichuan'', a late [[Ming dynasty]] painting after [[Qiu Ying]] (1494\u20131552).]]\nHistorians said that Emperor Xuanzong forced tens of thousand beautiful women to live in his palace to please him, more than many other [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] emperors.<ref>New Book of Tang, vol.132</ref> And he did not allow many to be set free even when they were old.<ref>[[Dao Fu]]. ''\u4e0a\u967d\u767d\u9aee\u4eba''</ref> As Emperor Xuanzong turned his attention to pleasure-seeking with his favorite concubine [[Yang Guifei]] and her family, he paid less and less attention to the running of his empire, and much of his power fell into the hands of the corrupt [[Li Linfu]] (who was succeeded by Lady Yang's dissolute cousin [[Yang Guozhong]]) and the eunuch [[Gao Lishi]].\n\nAt the same time, 751 saw the loss of the [[Battle of Talas]] against the Abbasid Caliphate. As a consequence, the Tang dynasty temporarily lost some of its influence in Central Asia to the emerging Abbasid Caliphate, as several Tang tributaries turned to the Abbasids.\n\nMeanwhile, the ''jiedushi'' (military governors), most of whom were non-[[Han Chinese|Han]] took more and more regional power into their own hands. Some successful generals included [[Geshu Han]], known for victories over the [[Tibetan Empire]]; [[Gao Xianzhi]], who conquered city states of the Xiyu region, eventually battling the Abbasids at Talas; and [[An Lushan]] who defeated and once again vassalized the Khitan. Eventually, in 755, An Lushan started the [[Anshi Rebellion]] at [[Fanyang]]. The rebels quickly seized the eastern capital [[Luoyang]], and then the imperial capital [[Chang'an]] six months later.

When he saw his son Prince of Shou Li Mao's wife (his daughter-in-law) Yang Yuhuan (Princess of Shou, by virtue of marriage), he was infatuated with her, and he had her become a [[Taoist]] nun and gave Li Mao the wife of the general Wei Zhaoxun (\u97cb\u662d\u8a13) as his new wife and princess. Meanwhile, he secretly took the nun, Yang, into the palace. She became his [[Ranks of Imperial Consorts in China|senior-ranking concubine (''guifei'')]], known as Yang Guifei, and soon became so powerful that officials were bribing her family members to get preferential treatment.

Li Linfu, who engaged a group of secret police officials to investigate and manufacture evidence against political enemies, was able to get Wei and Li Shizhi demoted and exiled in 746.  (Li Shizhi was replaced by [[Chen Xilie]], who gained favor from Emperor Xuanzong for his knowledge in [[Taoism]] and sorcery.)  In 747, Li Linfu further carried out a campaign of terror against exiled officials, and among the officials executed were Wei, Li Yong (\u674e\u9095) and Pei Dunfu (\u88f4\u6566\u5fa9). Li Shizhi and Wang Ju, who had been instrumental in Emperor Xuanzong's initial actions against Princess Taiping, committed suicide.<ref name=ZZTJ215/>\n\nMeanwhile, in 747, Emperor Xuanzong wanted to expand the government's talent pool, and so issued an edict ordering that the people who had unusual talents to come to Chang'an to be examined by himself. Li Linfu, fearing that these examinees might accuse him of improprieties when they get to meet the emperor, suggested that these examinees go through two levels of preliminary examinations \u2013 by the local governments, and then by the executive bureau. As a result, no one passed the first two levels of preliminary examinations, and Li LInfu subsequently submitted a note to Emperor Xuanzong congratulating him that no talent has been overlooked by the imperial administration.<ref name=ZZTJ215/>\n\n[[Image:China, 742.svg|thumb|250px|right|Tang territories and [[History of the political divisions of China#Provinces under the Tang dynasty|Tang provinces]] by 742.]]\nMeanwhile, also as of 747, An Lushan had become greatly favored by Emperor Xuanzong due to his military achievements and his willingness to flatter Emperor Xuanzong, Consort Yang, and her family members. Further, Li Linfu, apprehensive about the general [[Wang Zhongsi]], who at that time was in command of four circuits (Hexi, Longyou, [[Shuofang]], and Hedong), deprecated Wang in favor of An Lushan. In 747, after Li Linfu implicated Wang in hindering a campaign against the Tibetan Empire and further accused Wang of plotting a coup to overthrow Emperor Xuanzong and replace him with Li Heng, Wang was arrested and demoted, escaping death only at the pleas of Geshu, who was Wang's deputy and who subsequently was given the commands of Hexi and Longyou. An Lushan, who had already been in command of Fanyang and Pinglu Circuits, was also given Hedong, and thereafter was in command of the most elite troops of the empire.<ref name=ZZTJ215/>  Meanwhile, the ethnically [[Goguryeo]] general Gao Xianzhi had become prominent in the Xiyu region, expanding Tang power to the west.<ref name=ZZTJ216>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377216|216]].</ref>\n\nBy 748, Consort Yang's cousins Yang Guozhong, Yang Xian (\u694a\u929b) and Yang Qi (\u694a\u9321), as well as her three sisters (who were created the Ladies of Han, Guo, and Qin), had become exceedingly wealthy and powerful due to the favors that Emperor Xuanzong showed them. It was said that their wealth topped all households in Chang'an. It was also said that by 749, the empire was so wealthy that Emperor Xuanzong viewed treasures as expendable and so awarded them without limit.<ref name=ZZTJ216/>\n\n====Late ''Tianbao'' era====\nMeanwhile, Li Linfu had a tight grip on power and favors from Emperor Xuanzong throughout the years, but as of 750, Yang Guozhong and Chen Xilie had allied with each other and were finding ways to eliminate Li Linfu's allies from government.<ref name=ZZTJ216/>\n\nAs of 751, Tang was also facing defeats on two different external fronts \u2013 as [[Kingdom of Nanzhao|Nanzhao]]'s king Geluofeng (\u95a4\u7f85\u9cf3), angry about unreasonable demands that the Zhang Qiantuo (\u5f35\u8654\u9640) the governor of Yunnan Commandery (\u96f2\u5357, roughly modern [[Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture]], [[Yunnan]]) and Zhang's subsequent false accusations that he was planning to rebel, rebelled for real, and attacked and occupied Yunnan Commandery. A major attack by the general Xianyu Zhongtong (\u9bae\u4e8e\u4ef2\u901a) against Nanzhao failed terribly in 751, and subsequent defeats by Tang forces eventually led to a total of some 200,000 casualties among Tang troops. On the western front, Gao Xianzhi suffered a major defeat at the Abbasid forces at the [[Battle of Talas]] in 751 as well, ending the Tang expansion to the west.<ref name=ZZTJ216/>\n\nIn 752, Wang Hong's brother Wang Han (\u738b\u92b2) was accused of treason after his associates rose in a failed coup at Chang'an. In the aftermaths, Wang Hong was forced to commit suicide, and Yang Guozhong, Chen, and Geshu Han further tried to implicate Li Linfu in the plot as well. After Li LInfu died in winter 752, Yang Guozhong succeeded him, and almost immediately accused Li LInfu of having been complicit in the rebellion of another general, Li Xianzhong (\u674e\u737b\u5fe0). Li LInfu was posthumously disgraced, and his family was exiled.<ref name=ZZTJ216/>\n\nA rivalry soon developed between Yang Guozhong and An Lushan, and Yang Guozhong began to repeatedly warn Emperor Xuanzong that An was plotting rebellion. Emperor Xuanzong ignored the warnings. In 754, Yang Guozhong suggested that if An were summoned to the capital, he would surely refuse, and Emperor Xuanzong decided to try An \u2013 and An arrived in Chang'an immediately after being summoned. After this incident, Emperor Xuanzong no longer believed that An was plotting rebellion. Nevertheless, because of Yang Guozhong's opposition, he did not make An chancellor, as he was planning. Also in 754, with Yang Guozhong also trying to squeeze Chen out of the government, Chen resigned and was replaced by [[Wei Jiansu]].<ref name=ZZTJ217>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377217|vol. 217]].</ref>\n\n[[Image:Kano Eitoku 007.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Xuanzong with Consort Yang on a terrace with their attendants, by Japanese artist [[Kan\u014d Eitoku]] (1543\u20131590)]]\nIn 755, Yang Guozhong further provoked An, who was then back at his post in Fanyang, by surrounding An's mansion at Chang'an and arresting and executing An's staff members. An, in fear and anger, rebelled in winter 755, and quickly reached and captured Luoyang after defeating [[Feng Changqing]]'s undersupplied army. Subsequently, Emperor Xuanzong, believing in reports from the eunuch Bian Lingcheng (\u908a\u4ee4\u8aa0) that Feng was cowardly and that Feng's superior Gao Xianzhi was corrupt, executed both Feng and Gao and replaced Gao with Geshu in defending [[Tong Pass]] from An's advances. An declared himself emperor of a new state of [[Yan (Anshi)|Yan]] at Luoyang, but with Geshu defending Tong Pass, An's advances stalled, while Tang forces commanded by [[Li Guangbi]] and [[Guo Ziyi]] made advances against An-controlled territory north of the [[Yellow River]].<ref name=ZZTJ217/>  Meanwhile, though, Yang Guozhong, fearing that Geshu had designs against him, convinced Emperor Xuanzong to order Geshu to attack despite Geshu's warnings that doing so was risky.

For example, in spring 757, apparently without first consulting Emperor Suzong, he named [[Li Lin (Tang chancellor)|Li Lin]] chancellor, although he subsequently sent both Li Lin and another chancellor, [[Cui Yuan (705\u2013768)|Cui Yuan]], whom he had not sent to Emperor Suzong previously, to Emperor Suzong. He also posthumously honored Emperor Suzong's mother Consort Yang (not Yang Yuhuan) as an empress. Meanwhile, remembering Zhang Jiuling had previously warned about An Lushan, Emperor Xuanzong sent messengers to Zhang's tomb to offer sacrifices to him.<ref name=ZZTJ219>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377219|vol. 219]].</ref>\n\nLate in 757, Emperor Suzong, with aid from Huige, recaptured Chang'an from Yan, then ruled by An Lushan's son [[An Qingxu]], who had killed An Lushan earlier in 757 and taken over the throne himself. After Emperor Suzong recaptured Chang'an, he sent messengers to Emperor Xuanzong requesting that he return to Chang'an and offering the throne back to Emperor Xuanzong. Emperor Xuanzong, apprehensive of the offer, initially not only declined but further requested to remain in Jiannan. Only after Emperor Suzong, at the suggestion of his strategist [[Li Mi (chancellor)|Li Mi]], had the government officials make a joint submission to Emperor Xuanzong no longer mentioning the return of the throne, did Emperor Xuanzong agree to depart Jiannan to return to Chang'an.<ref name=ZZTJ220>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377220|vol. 220]].</ref>  On the way back to Chang'an, he had Gao Lishi try to dig up Consort Yang Yuhuan's body for reburial, but her body had already decomposed; only her fragrance bag remained.

For example, Emperor Suzong had wanted to spare Zhang Shuo's sons Zhang Jun (\u5f35\u5747) and Zhang Ji (\u5f35\u578d), who had previously submitted to An Lushan, because of Zhang Shuo's contributions and Zhang Jun's and Zhang Ji's prior efforts to protect him from Li Linfu's machinations, but Emperor Xuanzong deeply hated them for having surrendered to An, and at Emperor Xuanzong's insistence, Zhang Jun was executed, and Zhang Ji was exiled to Lingnan.<ref name=ZZTJ220/>\n\nMeanwhile, after a while, Emperor Xuanzong settled into a routine at Xingqing Palace, with Chen Xuanli and Gao Lishi attending to him. Also often attending to him were his daughter Li Chiying (\u674e\u6301\u76c8), the Princess Yuzhen, the lady in waiting Ru Xianyuan (\u5982\u4ed9\u5a9b), and the eunuchs Wang Cheng'en (\u738b\u627f\u6069) and Wei Yue (\u9b4f\u6085). The imperial musicians often played for him, and he often climbed up Changqing Tower (\u9577\u6176\u6a13) to receive well wishes from the populace. He also often held feasts for generals and people from Jiannan, with Li Chiying and Ru serving as hostesses. Meanwhile, though, Emperor Xuanzong's attendants looked down at the powerful eunuch [[Li Fuguo]], who had served Emperor Suzong throughout the campaign against Yan. To retaliate, Li Fuguo began to try to convince Emperor Suzong that Emperor Xuanzong and his attendants were plotting to seize power back. In 760, with Emperor Suzong's tacit, although not explicit, approval, on one occasion when Emperor Xuanzong was out riding, Li Fuguo intercepted him and forced him to move back to the main palace. Even on that occasion, however, Gao would not submit to Li Fuguo, and even yelled at Li Fuguo to force him to get off his horse and to escort Emperor Xuanzong on foot, along with Gao.
