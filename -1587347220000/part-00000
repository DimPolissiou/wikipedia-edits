It was completed in 1874. The Delaware and Bound Brook reached Hopewell in 1876, but the railroad had to cross the Mercer and Somerset's track just to the northwest of Hopewell. A dispute occurred at the crossing, known as a [[Railroad turnout#Frog (common crossing)|frog]], and escalated into each company parking locomotives over the crossing to prevent the other company from moving trains over it. Eventually militia had to be called in to keep the peace, and the Delaware and Bound Brook prevailed.<ref>Railroads of New Jersey Fragments of the past in the Garden State Landscape Lorett Treese 2006</ref> Soon after the Frog War the Mercer and Somerset was liquidated having failed at its purpose.

It was created largely to protect the monopoly the Pennsylvania Railroad had on New Jersey, by cutting off the first separately owned railroad in New Jersey, the [[Delaware and Bound Brook Railroad]], by being built in the way of it. It was completed in 1874. The Delaware and Bound Brook reached Hopewell in 1876, but the railroad had to cross the Mercer and Somerset's track just to the northwest of Hopewell. A dispute occurred at the crossing, known as a [[Railroad turnout#Frog (common crossing)|frog]], and escalated into each company parking locomotives over the crossing to prevent the other company from moving trains over it. Eventually militia had to be called in to keep the peace, and the Delaware and Bound Brook prevailed.<ref>Railroads of New Jersey Fragments of the past in the Garden State Landscape Lorett Treese 2006</ref> Soon after the Frog War the Mercer and Somerset was liquidated having failed at its purpose.

Controversy arose in the CIA over whether he was a bona fide [[defector]] and he was held in detention for over three years before he was finally accepted as a legitimate defector by the CIA. After his release, he became an American citizen, working as a consultant for the CIA.\n\n==Biography==\nNosenko was born in Nikolaev, Ukrainian SSR (now [[Mykolaiv]], [[Ukraine]]).  His father, [[Ivan Nosenko]], was USSR Minister of Shipbuilding from 1939 until his death in 1956.  During WWII, Nosenko attended naval preparatory school, intending on a career in shipbuilding, like his father. After the war, he attended the [[Moscow State Institute of International Relations]] (MGIMO), graduating in 1950. On graduation he served in Naval Intelligence until he transferred to the KGB in 1953. In the KGB, he worked primarily in the Second Chief Directorate, which was responsible for internal security.{{sfn|Mangold|1992|p=162}}\n\n==Defection==\n{{quote|Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko, an officer of the KGB, defected to a representative of this Agency in Geneva, Switzerland, on 4 February 1964. The responsibility for his exploitation was assigned to the then SR Division of the Clandestine Service and he was brought to this country on 12 February 1964. After initial interrogation by representatives of the SR Division, he was moved to a safehouse in Clinton, Maryland, from 4 April 1964 where he was confined and interrogated until 13 August 1965 when he was moved to a specially constructed \"jail\" in a remote wooded area at [redacted] The SR Division was convinced that he was a dispatched agent but even after a long period of hostile interrogation was unable to prove their contention and he was confined at [redacted] in an effort to convince him to \"confess.\"\n\nThis Office together with the Office of General Counsel became increasingly concerned with the illegality of the Agency's position in handling a defector under these conditions for such a long period of time. Strong representations were made to the Director (Mr. Helms) by this Office, the Office of General Counsel, and the Legislative Liaison Counsel, and on 27 October 1967, the responsibility for Nosenko's further handling was transferred to the Office of Security under the direction of the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, then Admiral Rufus Taylor.\n\nNosenko was moved to a comfortable safehouse in the Washington area and was interviewed under friendly, sympathetic conditions by his Security Case Officer, Mr. Bruce Solie, for more than a year. It soon became apparent that Nosenko was bona fide and he was moved to more comfortable surroundings with considerable freedom of independent movement and has continued to cooperate fully with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and this Office since that time. He has proven to be the most \u200bvaluable and economical defector this Agency has ever had and leads which were ignored by the SR Division were explored and have resulted in the arrest and prosecution [redacted] He currently is living under an alias; secured a divorce from his Russian wife and remarried an American citizen. He is happy, relaxed, and appreciative of the treatment accorded him and states \"while I regret my three years of incarceration, I have no bitterness and now understand how it could happen.\"<ref>https://www.cia.gov/open/Family%20Jewels.pdf{{PD-notice}}</ref>}}\n\nNosenko contacted the CIA in Geneva, when he accompanied a diplomatic mission to that city in 1962. Nosenko offered his services for a small amount of money, claiming that a prostitute had robbed him of $900 worth of Swiss francs. He claimed to be deputy chief of the Seventh Department of the KGB, and provided some information that would only be known by someone connected to the KGB. He was given the money he requested and told $25,000 a year would be deposited in an account in his name in the West.

Controversy arose in the CIA over whether he was a bona fide [[defector]] and he was held in detention for over three years before he was finally accepted as a legitimate defector by the CIA. After his release, he became an American citizen, working as a consultant for the CIA.\n\n==Biography==\nNosenko was born in Nikolaev, Ukrainian SSR (now [[Mykolaiv]], [[Ukraine]]).  His father, [[Ivan Nosenko]], was USSR Minister of Shipbuilding from 1939 until his death in 1956.  During WWII, Nosenko attended naval preparatory school, intending on a career in shipbuilding, like his father. After the war, he attended the [[Moscow State Institute of International Relations]] (MGIMO), graduating in 1950. On graduation he served in Naval Intelligence until he transferred to the KGB in 1953. In the KGB, he worked primarily in the Second Chief Directorate, which was responsible for internal security.{{sfn|Mangold|1992|p=162}}\n\n==Defection==\n{{quote|Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko, an officer of the KGB, defected to a representative of this Agency in Geneva, Switzerland, on 4 February 1964. The responsibility for his exploitation was assigned to the then SR Division of the Clandestine Service and he was brought to this country on 12 February 1964. After initial interrogation by representatives of the SR Division, he was moved to a safehouse in Clinton, Maryland, from 4 April 1964 where he was confined and interrogated until 13 August 1965 when he was moved to a specially constructed \"jail\" in a remote wooded area at [redacted] The SR Division was convinced that he was a dispatched agent but even after a long period of hostile interrogation was unable to prove their contention and he was confined at [redacted] in an effort to convince him to \"confess.\"\n\nThis Office together with the Office of General Counsel became increasingly concerned with the illegality of the Agency's position in handling a defector under these conditions for such a long period of time. Strong representations were made to the Director (Mr. Helms) by this Office, the Office of General Counsel, and the Legislative Liaison Counsel, and on 27 October 1967, the responsibility for Nosenko's further handling was transferred to the Office of Security under the direction of the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, then Admiral Rufus Taylor.\n\nNosenko was moved to a comfortable safehouse in the Washington area and was interviewed under friendly, sympathetic conditions by his Security Case Officer, Mr. Bruce Solie, for more than a year. It soon became apparent that Nosenko was bona fide and he was moved to more comfortable surroundings with considerable freedom of independent movement and has continued to cooperate fully with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and this Office since that time. He has proven to be the most \u200bvaluable and economical defector this Agency has ever had and leads which were ignored by the SR Division were explored and have resulted in the arrest and prosecution [redacted] He currently is living under an alias; secured a divorce from his Russian wife and remarried an American citizen.

Nosenko offered his services for a small amount of money, claiming that a prostitute had robbed him of $900 worth of Swiss francs. He claimed to be deputy chief of the Seventh Department of the KGB, and provided some information that would only be known by someone connected to the KGB. He was given the money he requested and told $25,000 a year would be deposited in an account in his name in the West.

Despite these and other indications, both CIA and FBI administrations choose for a number of reasons to ignore the obvious in either cases.\n\nNosenko has later claimed to have been tortured and even at one point, he said during interrogation, he was given [[LSD]], and it almost killed him. The guards revived him by dragging him into the shower and alternating the water between hot and cold.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} These claims have been denied by [[Richard Helms]] who was Director of Central Intelligence during the most intense part of Nosenko's interrogation.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nGolitsyn's defection led the KGB to notify fifty-four [[Rezidentura]] to temporarily suspend all meetings with important agents.<ref name=\"Mitrokhin\">[[Christopher Andrew (historian)|Christopher Andrew]] and [[Vasili Mitrokhin]] (1999).

He has written newspaper articles and autobiographical, historical and fictional books. \n\nHe was born in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] in the United States, to Canadian parents, and immigrated to Canada.  He graduated from [[Macdonald Campus|Macdonald Agricultural College]] of [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]] [[Quebec]] in 1956. \n\n== Career ==\nLowell Green started his radio broadcasting career in [[Brantford]], Ontario, and subsequently moved to radio stations in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] Ontario and [[Montreal, Quebec|Montreal Quebec]].  Green arrived in Ottawa at CFRA in 1960 as a news and [[farm]] reporter.  In 1966, he began hosting ''Greenline'', and eventually became the longest-running open-line talk show host in [[North America]]. He retired briefly from radio in the 1980s, but returned in 1990.  Two of his historic broadcasts are being preserved at [[Library and Archives Canada]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Green|first=Lowell|url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/Death_in_October.html?id=vDEJuHHU0GUC&redir_esc=y|title=Death in October|date=|publisher=eBookIt.com|year=|isbn=978-1-4566-1102-6|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, he returned to CFRA and hosted ''The Lowell Green Show'' until his official retirement on 4 January 2016.

There were so many bottles and containers of polluted water that [[Canada Post]] objected and did not want to deliver them all.

Several complaints have been made against him to the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC).

In 1966, he began hosting ''Greenline'', and eventually became the longest-running open-line talk show host in [[North America]]. He retired briefly from radio in the 1980s, but returned in 1990.

In the third quarter, the 49ers began to pull away, with a [[Robbie Gould]] [[Field goal|field goal]] and a rushing touchdown by [[Raheem Mostert]] giving them a 20\u201310 lead heading into the fourth quarter. However, over the last 6:13 of the game, the Chiefs offense completed two touchdown drives with Mahomes throwing touchdown passes to [[Travis Kelce]] and [[Damien Williams]], to take the lead just before the [[two-minute warning]].

This was also the first Super Bowl in [[Super Bowl XLVII|7 years]] to not feature quarterbacks [[Tom Brady]] or [[Peyton Manning]].\n\nThe first half of the game was back and forth between both teams, with the game tied at 10 heading into halftime. In the third quarter, the 49ers began to pull away, with a [[Robbie Gould]] [[Field goal|field goal]] and a rushing touchdown by [[Raheem Mostert]] giving them a 20\u201310 lead heading into the fourth quarter. However, over the last 6:13 of the game, the Chiefs offense completed two touchdown drives with Mahomes throwing touchdown passes to [[Travis Kelce]] and [[Damien Williams]], to take the lead just before the [[two-minute warning]]. The Chiefs then stopped the 49ers on defense, and a late rushing touchdown by Damien Williams, as well as a [[Kendall Fuller]] interception, sealed the victory and ended the Chiefs' 50-year championship drought.<ref>{{cite news|author=Around the NFL staff|title=Twitter reacts to Chiefs' first SB win in 50 years|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001100800/article/twitter-reacts-to-chiefs-first-sb-win-in-50-years|publisher=NFL Enterprises|website=NFL.com|date=February 2, 2020|access-date=February 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe game's broadcast in the United States by [[Fox NFL|Fox]], along with the [[Super Bowl LIV halftime show|halftime show]] headlined by [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Shakira]], was seen by an estimated 102 million viewers\u2014a slight increase over [[Super Bowl LIII]] in 2019 (which had seen the smallest audience for the game in 10 years).\n\n==Background==\n===Host selection process===\n\n[[File:200127-H-PX819-0092.jpg|thumb|Hard Rock Stadium decorated for the Super Bowl|left]]\n\nOn May 19, 2015, the league announced the four finalists that would compete to host either [[Super Bowl LIII]] in 2019 or Super Bowl LIV.

This meant the new stadium was scheduled to be open in time for the game (and the league selected the relocating team just in time to be considered for Super Bowl LIV), but, under the current construction timetable, would require a waiver of league policy to host Super Bowl LIV, as the league does not allow stadiums in their first year of existence to host the Super Bowl to ensure stadium construction delays and unforeseen problems do not jeopardize the game.

It was originally published in January 1995 by [[Alfred A. Knopf]].\n\nIn 1995, Nicholas Negroponte outlined the history of digital technologies in his book, [[w:Being Digital|''Being Digital'']]. Along with the general history, he also predicted possibilities for the future of these technologies.{{sfn|Negroponte|1995|p=25}} \n''Being Digital'' provides a general history of several [[digital media]] technologies, many that Negroponte himself was directly involved in developing. Negroponte analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of the technologies (such as his belief that [[high-definition television]] wastes broadcasting power) and tries to predict how the technologies will evolve. The message in Nicholas Negroponte's, ''Being Digital'', is that eventually, we will move toward an entirely digital society (be it newspapers, entertainment, or sex). ''Being Digital'' also introduced the \"''[[Daily Me]]''\" concept of a virtual daily newspaper customized for an individual's tastes. This prediction has also come to pass with the advent of [[web feed]]s and [[Web portal#Personal portals|personal web portals]].\nNegroponte's concept of newspapers being tailored to our specific interest is a notion that has become more common over time.

The bit is digital or virtual where there is no mass and it can travel and communicate instantaneous throughout multiple platforms. Everything is becoming digital.The public utilizes and depends on the [[information superhighway]] because the people demand instantaneous results. Bits bring upon instant results without weight or physical matter to rummage through. Decentralizing, globalizing, harmonizing, and empowering are the four qualities of the digital age.{{sfn|Alfred|1996|p=}} When Negroponte says 'bits are bits' he is talking about the fact that bits can be used not only to create more bits, but also new modes of media. Adding bits creates a better picture, clearer sound, and instructions for devices, combining different types of bits gives us multimedia.

It was his idea that a better use of available communication resources would result if information such as phone calls going through cables was to go through the air, and information now going through the air, such as television signals, was to be delivered over cables.

That dramatic defeat was also the last appearance in his playing career for team captain [[Antonino Asta]], who seriously injured during the match and did not manage to recover; he was part of the first team squad in the season 2003-04, without however making a single appearance. Following the events, Palermo made a number of prominent signings in the summer market, such as [[Eugenio Corini]], [[Andrea Gasbarroni]] and [[Luca Toni]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2004/giugno/13/ultima_notte_Toni_ga_10_0406135443.shtml|publisher=gazzetta.it|title= The last night of Toni|language=Italian}}</ref>; in addition, Palermo-born star [[Gaetano Vasari]] agreed to join the ''rosanero'' with a salary based on the number of appearances he would have made in the season. [[Silvio Baldini]] was appointed as new boss to replace [[Nedo Sonetti]]. Several football pundits suggested Palermo to be the real favourite team to win the Serie B league because of the quality of its roster.\n\nThe team made a very impressive start by defeating [[Gianfranco Zola]]'s [[Cagliari Calcio]], and managed to be always in the promotion spots. However, following a surprising 3-1 home defeat to [[Salernitana Calcio 1919|Salernitana]] that brought Palermo down to third place, Baldini heavily criticized club chairman [[Maurizio Zamparini]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116150927/http://www.raisport.rai.it/pub/sezione/raiSportSezioneIndex/0%2C5785%2C_205_60_1416%2C00.html|title= Zamparini Interview|language=Italian|publisher=raisport.it}}</ref> who consequently fired him and appointed [[Francesco Guidolin]] at his place. On the last day of the January transfer market, three new notable signings were made: [[Antonio Filippini]], [[Emanuele Filippini]] and [[Fabio Grosso]].

The ''rosanero'' ended the season in first place, being crowned Serie B champions and promoted to [[Serie A]] after 31 years in the lower divisions.\n\n==Summary==\nAmbitious Palermo failed to gain promotion to [[Serie A]] in the previous season following a 3-0 away defeat in the final match against [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]], which were promoted at Palermo's place<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914131104/http://www.ilpalermocalcio.it/it/0304/numeri.jsp|title= Season 2002-30 Palermo |publisher=ilpalermocalcio.it|language=Italian}}</ref>. That dramatic defeat was also the last appearance in his playing career for team captain [[Antonino Asta]], who seriously injured during the match and did not manage to recover; he was part of the first team squad in the season 2003-04, without however making a single appearance. Following the events, Palermo made a number of prominent signings in the summer market, such as [[Eugenio Corini]], [[Andrea Gasbarroni]] and [[Luca Toni]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2004/giugno/13/ultima_notte_Toni_ga_10_0406135443.shtml|publisher=gazzetta.it|title= The last night of Toni|language=Italian}}</ref>; in addition, Palermo-born star [[Gaetano Vasari]] agreed to join the ''rosanero'' with a salary based on the number of appearances he would have made in the season. [[Silvio Baldini]] was appointed as new boss to replace [[Nedo Sonetti]]. Several football pundits suggested Palermo to be the real favourite team to win the Serie B league because of the quality of its roster.\n\nThe team made a very impressive start by defeating [[Gianfranco Zola]]'s [[Cagliari Calcio]], and managed to be always in the promotion spots. However, following a surprising 3-1 home defeat to [[Salernitana Calcio 1919|Salernitana]] that brought Palermo down to third place, Baldini heavily criticized club chairman [[Maurizio Zamparini]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116150927/http://www.raisport.rai.it/pub/sezione/raiSportSezioneIndex/0%2C5785%2C_205_60_1416%2C00.html|title= Zamparini Interview|language=Italian|publisher=raisport.it}}</ref> who consequently fired him and appointed [[Francesco Guidolin]] at his place. On the last day of the January transfer market, three new notable signings were made: [[Antonio Filippini]], [[Emanuele Filippini]] and [[Fabio Grosso]]. Palermo later returned to top the table and eventually won the league, ending with the same points than Cagliari, but being crowned as Serie B champions due to head-to-head matches.\n\n==Squad==\n{{fs
