She is best known for her 2012 autobiography, ''[[Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots]]'', which tells the story of her escape from an ultra-religious community in [[Brooklyn, New York]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\nFeldman grew up as a member of the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar group]] in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]], [[New York City]].{{R|Bonos}} She was raised by her grandparents, both Holocaust survivors, since her mother had been banished by the community, and her mentally impaired father wasn't able to raise her on his own. Like all girls in the community, Feldman was raised to be pious, spoke in Yiddish, and was banned from going to the public library. She was denied a typical American education, but hid books under her bed for fear her elders would suspect her growing curiosity about the world. She entered an arranged marriage at the age of 17, and became a mother at 19.{{R|DONALDSON}}{{R|Goodreads}}\n\n==Separation from Hasidic community==\nFeldman says that the birth of her son was a turning point regarding staying in the Hasidic community: \"I saw my future all mapped out... I freaked out at the knowledge that I have the responsibility and guilt of putting everything I saw as my oppression into an innocent person.\" Feldman lied to her husband saying she wanted to take business classes so she could supplement his income, and in 2006, she and her husband moved out of Williamsburg and she began to study literature at [[Sarah Lawrence College]].{{R|DONALDSON}}\n\nOnce in school she \"made a beeline\" for a college degree to connect her with the outside world. She began to speak out and \"open my mind.\" She also began to wear jeans and high heels, breaking the strict Hasidic dress code. In 2010, she took her son, left her husband, and cut all ties with the Hasidic community.{{R|Wiener}} She lived for two months with friends, and consulted with lawyers to make sure she didn't lose custody of her son. As of 2012, Feldman had not seen or spoken to any of her family since 2006.{{R|DONALDSON}}\n\nDespite her differences with the Hasidic community, Feldman has said \"I am proud of being Jewish, because I think that\u2019s where my indomitable spirit comes from.\"{{R|NYT2012}}\n\n==Career==\nFeldman started blogging and in 2012 published her autobiography, ''[[Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots]]'',{{R|hardcover}} which became a best-seller.{{R|amazon}} In 2014, Feldman moved to Berlin, where she settled in the [[Neuk\u00f6lln (locality)|Neuk\u00f6lln]] district, and continued to work as a writer.{{R|ARFA}} In 2014 she published ''Exodus: A Memoir.'' {{R|Exodus}} Her books have been translated into German, and well received by German critics, which led to her appearing on various talk shows on German TV.{{R|Wiener}}{{R|Guardian2010}}\n\nFeldman is featured in the 2018 Swiss-German documentary ''[[Female Pleasure|#Female Pleasure]]''{{R|Pleasure}} and the 2020 [[Netflix]] original miniseries ''[[Unorthodox (miniseries)|Unorthodox]]'' is loosely based on her autobiography.{{R|MAZRIA}}\n\n==Criticism==\nMembers of the Orthodox community have lashed back at Feldman, including in a blog titled \"Deborah Feldman Exposed,\" which was dedicated to \"exposing the lies and fabrications\" in her story.{{R|LEUNG}} Jesse Kornbluth examined this criticism in a pair of article in the [[Huffington Post]] which concluded \"There are claims in this book that Hasids have disputed. I can\u2019t tell what\u2019s true. But I\u2019m sure of one thing: Men who can\u2019t live equally with women aren\u2019t worth living with. No doubt girls all over Brooklyn are buying this book, hiding it under their mattresses, reading it after lights out \u2014 and contemplating, perhaps for the first time, their own escape.\"{{R|Kornbluth1}}{{R|Kornbluth2}}\n\n== Bibliography==\n*''[[Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots]]'' {{R|amazon}} \n*''Exodus: A Memoir'' {{R|Exodus}}\n\n==See

She is best known for her 2012 autobiography, ''[[Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots]]'', which tells the story of her escape from an ultra-religious community in [[Brooklyn, New York]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\nFeldman grew up as a member of the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar group]] in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]], [[New York City]].{{R|Bonos}} She was raised by her grandparents, both Holocaust survivors, since her mother had been banished by the community, and her mentally impaired father wasn't able to raise her on his own. Like all girls in the community, Feldman was raised to be pious, spoke in Yiddish, and was banned from going to the public library. She was denied a typical American education, but hid books under her bed for fear her elders would suspect her growing curiosity about the world. She entered an arranged marriage at the age of 17, and became a mother at 19.{{R|DONALDSON}}{{R|Goodreads}}\n\n==Separation from Hasidic community==\nFeldman says that the birth of her son was a turning point regarding staying in the Hasidic community: \"I saw my future all mapped out... I freaked out at the knowledge that I have the responsibility and guilt of putting everything I saw as my oppression into an innocent person.\" Feldman lied to her husband saying she wanted to take business classes so she could supplement his income, and in 2006, she and her husband moved out of Williamsburg and she began to study literature at [[Sarah Lawrence College]].{{R|DONALDSON}}\n\nOnce in school she \"made a beeline\" for a college degree to connect her with the outside world. She began to speak out and \"open my mind.\" She also began to wear jeans and high heels, breaking the strict Hasidic dress code. In 2010, she took her son, left her husband, and cut all ties with the Hasidic community.{{R|Wiener}} She lived for two months with friends, and consulted with lawyers to make sure she didn't lose custody of her son. As of 2012, Feldman had not seen or spoken to any of her family since 2006.{{R|DONALDSON}}\n\nDespite her differences with the Hasidic community, Feldman has said \"I am proud of being Jewish, because I think that\u2019s where my indomitable spirit comes from.\"{{R|NYT2012}}\n\n==Career==\nFeldman started blogging and in 2012 published her autobiography, ''[[Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots]]'',{{R|hardcover}} which became a best-seller.{{R|amazon}} In 2014, Feldman moved to Berlin, where she settled in the [[Neuk\u00f6lln (locality)|Neuk\u00f6lln]] district, and continued to work as a writer.{{R|ARFA}} In 2014 she published ''Exodus: A Memoir.'' {{R|Exodus}} Her books have been translated into German, and well received by German critics, which led to her appearing on various talk shows on German TV.{{R|Wiener}}{{R|Guardian2010}}\n\nFeldman is featured in the 2018 Swiss-German documentary ''[[Female Pleasure|#Female Pleasure]]''{{R|Pleasure}} and the 2020 [[Netflix]] original miniseries ''[[Unorthodox (miniseries)|Unorthodox]]'' is loosely based on her autobiography.{{R|MAZRIA}}\n\n==Criticism==\nMembers of the Orthodox community have lashed back at Feldman, including in a blog titled \"Deborah Feldman Exposed,\" which was dedicated to \"exposing the lies and fabrications\" in her story.{{R|LEUNG}} Jesse Kornbluth examined this criticism in a pair of article in the [[Huffington Post]] which concluded \"There are claims in this book that Hasids have disputed. I can\u2019t tell what\u2019s true. But I\u2019m sure of one thing: Men who can\u2019t live equally with women aren\u2019t worth living with. No doubt girls all over Brooklyn are buying this book, hiding it under their mattresses, reading it after lights out \u2014 and contemplating, perhaps for the first time, their own escape..\"{{R|Kornbluth1}}{{R|Kornbluth2}}\n\n== Bibliography==\n*''[[Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots]]'' {{R|amazon}} \n*''Exodus: A Memoir'' {{R|Exodus}}\n\n==See
