{"title_page": "Major League Baseball postseason", "text_new": "\n\n{{Redirect|Major League Baseball playoffs|tie-breaker games|List of Major League Baseball tie-breakers}}\n{{MLB playoffs sidebar}}\nThe '''Major League Baseball postseason''' is an [[single-elimination tournament|elimination tournament]] held after the conclusion of the [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] regular season. Since 2012, the playoffs for each league\u2014[[American League|American]] and [[National League|National]]\u2014consist of a one-game [[Major League Baseball Wild Card Game|wild-card playoff]] between two [[Wild card (sports)|wild card]] teams, four best-of-five [[Division Series]] (LDS) featuring the wild-card winner and the winner of each division, and finally the best-of-seven [[League Championship Series]] (LCS). The winners of the [[American League Championship Series]] (ALCS) and the [[National League Championship Series]] (NLCS) play each other in the best-of-seven [[World Series]]. The current system allows for a maximum of 46 post season games and a minimum of 26 games.\n\n==Format history==\n\n===Before 1969: World Series only===\nMajor League Baseball is the oldest of America's major professional sports organizations, steeped in tradition with roots dating back to the 1870s. The final series to determine its champion has been called the \"[[World Series]]\" (originally \"World's Championship Series\" and then \"World's Series\") as far back as the National League's contests with the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] starting at the beginning of the 1880s.\n\nIn 1903, the two modern Major League Baseball leagues began annual postseason play with a one-round system in which the American League team with the best record faced the National League team with the best record in a [[playoff format#Best-of-seven playoff|best-of-seven]] series (in 1903, 1919, 1920, and 1921 it was best-of-nine) called the [[World Series]]; however, there was no 1904 Series because the National League Champion, the New York Giants, refused to play. This single-tiered approach persisted through 1968, even with the [[History of baseball in the United States#1961\u20131962|expansions of 1961\u20131962]] that expanded both leagues to 10 teams.\n\n===1969\u20131993: Two rounds===\nIn 1969, both leagues expanded to twelve teams, which made it more difficult to compete for a league championship because there were more teams competing for the AL and NL pennants. In addition, a team would play other clubs in its own region of the country more than clubs in the rest of the country, creating an unbalanced schedule that in some years could give a team from one region an advantage in fighting for a single pennant. To remedy this, and imitating the other major sports' long-standing playoff traditions, Major League Baseball split each league into Eastern and Western divisions, creating four divisions overall and no worse than a sixth-place finish for any team in any division until later expansions in 1977 and 1993. This created a new postseason round, which was dubbed the [[League Championship Series]] (LCS), a [[playoff format#Best-of-five playoff|best-of-five]] series. In 1985 the LCS was expanded to a best-of-seven series.\n\nUnder this system, it was possible for one of the best teams in a league to be left out of the postseason if it didn't win its division.  Most notably, in {{mlby|1993}}, the [[1993 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] and [[1993 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] finished with the two best records in the majors, with 104 and 103 wins, respectively.  However, since both teams played in the National League West, the Giants missed the postseason by a single game.\n\nThe baseball players' strike of 1981 uniquely\u2014for this era\u2014added another round to the postseason.  Because the strike split the season into two roughly equal halves, the division winners of each half of the 1981 season first met in a best-of-five [[Division Series]].  The winners of the division series then progressed to the league championship series, with the remainder of the postseason following a similar format to other years in this era.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Durso |first1=Joseph |title=Owners Approve a Plan to Split Baseball Season |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/07/sports/owners-approve-a-plan-to-split-baseball-season.html |work=The New York Times |date=August 7, 1981}}</ref>\n\n===1994\u20132011: Three rounds===\nMajor League Baseball went through a realignment in 1994, when both the American and National leagues expanded to three divisions: Eastern, Central, and Western.  To avoid a playoff with an odd number of divisional winners, the league added a [[Major League Baseball wild card|wild card]] playoff spot to each league, imitating the original post-merger NFL system.  The wild-card for each league would be the team with the best record that did not win their division, eliminating a circumstance where a team with the second-best record in the entire league would miss the playoff because of not winning its division.  This new format doubled the postseason contenders in each league from two to four, and from four teams overall to eight.  The addition of a second wild card spot occurred in 2012.\n\nThe additional teams meant another elimination round was necessary. This new round would become the new first round of the postseason, the best-of-five [[Division Series]]. This term had first been used for the extra round required in 1981 due to the \"split-season\" scheduling anomaly following the midseason [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|baseball players strike]]. This format was in place for the 1994 season, but that year's [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]] canceled the postseason. The format was realized on the field in 1995.\n\nUnder this format, in the two Divisional Series, the wild card team played the divisional champion outside its own division that had the better record, with the remaining two teams playing each other in the second Division Series for each league.   The two Division Series winners from each league go on to play each other in the League Championship Series.  As with the previous postseason format, the winners of each League Championship Series met in the World Series.\n\n===2012\u2013present: Expanded wild card===\nWith the adoption of the new [[collective bargaining agreement]] in November 2011, baseball commissioner [[Bud Selig]] announced that a new playoff system would begin within two years; the change was ultimately put into place in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120229&content_id=26927024&vkey=news_mlb&c_id=mlb|title=Addition of Wild Card berths finalized for 2012|first=Barry M.|last=Bloom|work=MLB.com|date=March 2, 2012}}</ref>  The format chosen was the one-game [[Major League Baseball wild-card playoff|wild-card playoff]].\n\nUnder this format, a second wild card team has been added to each league, i.e., the team with the second-highest win total in each league among non-division winners. The two wild card teams play in a one-game playoff after the end of the regular season, with the winner advancing to the Division Series. The divisional champions qualify for the Division Series just as in the previous format; however, under the expanded wild card format the winner of the one-game wild card playoff faces the top-seeded divisional champion in the Division Series, regardless of whether the two teams are in the same division, while the second- and third-seeded divisional champions play each other in the other Division Series. The format for placement in the League Championship Series and World Series remains.\n\n===Proposal: Expansion to 14 teams===\nMLB is proposing to expand the playoffs to 14 teams; once the current collective bargaining agreement expires in 2021, the change may happen in 2022. There could be four wild card teams & three division winners per league. Only the division winner with the best record gets a first-round bye into the Division Series. \n\nThe proposed first-round format will be best-of-three series, with the higher seeds hosting every game. The second seed may choose to play the fifth, sixth or seventh-seeded team; then the third seed from remaining two; with the fourth playing the remaining team. No changes will be made for the rest of the playoffs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://MLB.com/news/MLB-considering-new-postseason-format|title=MLB considering new format for postseason|first=Mark|last=Feinsand|work=MLB.com|date=2020-02-10}}</ref>\n\n==Home-field advantage==\n\n===World Series===\nThe World Series used several different formats in its early years. Initially it generally followed an alternating home-and-away pattern, except that if a seventh game was possible, its site was determined by coin toss prior to the sixth game. In 1924 the Series began using a 2-3-2 format, presumably to save on travel costs, a pattern that has continued to this day with the exception of a couple of the World War II years when wartime travel restrictions compelled a 3-4 format (used in 1943 and 1945, but not in the 1944 series, which was contested between crosstown rivals the St. Louis Browns and St. Louis Cardinals; all games were held in the same stadium in St. Louis). From the start of the 2-3-2 format through the 2002 season, [[Home advantage|home-field advantage]] generally alternated between leagues each year. Prior to the 1994 strike, the National League champion received home-field advantage in even-numbered years and the American League champion in odd-numbered years; these were reversed for 1995\u20132002 (because 1994 would have been the NL's turn to have home-field, but the World Series was cancelled by the aforementioned strike). That changed starting in 2003.\n\nThe [[2002 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2002 All-Star Game]] had ended in a tie, much to the displeasure of both fans and sportswriters who complained about a lack of intensity and competitiveness on the part of the players. This hit especially close to home for Commissioner [[Bud Selig]], as the game had been played in his home city of [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]. In response, to give some real meaning to the game, in 2003 MLB began assigning home-field advantage in the World Series to the winner of that year's All-Star Game, which is typically held in mid-July.\n\nFollowing the acceptance of a new collective bargaining agreement after the 2016 season, home-field advantage in the World Series is no longer tied to the outcome of the All-Star Game, but instead goes to the team with the better regular-season record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/18178051/new-cba-ending-all-star-link-world-series|title=CBA ending All-Star link to World Series' home-field advantage|work=ESPN.com|date=December 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===League Championship Series===\nUntil 1998, the LCS alternated home-field advantage with a 2-3 format in the best-of-5 era (1969\u201384) and a 2-3-2 format when it went to best-of-7 (1985\u2013present). Since 1998, the team with the better record has had home field advantage, but a wild card team can never secure the extra home game, regardless of regular-season records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://registration.mlbpa.org/pdf/majorleaguerules.pdf|title=The Official Professional Baseball Rules Book (PDF)|date = 2018|website = MLBPA.org|publisher = Office of the Commissioner of Baseball|access-date= August 27, 2018|quote= Games 1, 2, 6 and 7 shall be scheduled in the ballpark of the opponent of a Wild Card Club in the League Championship Series, notwithstanding the percentage of games won and lost by such Wild Card Club}}</ref>\n\n===Division Series===\nUntil 1997, the Division Series rotated in which one of the three division-winning teams did not have home field-advantage, with the wild card team never having it. Since 1998, the two division winners with the best records in each league have home field, with the least-winning divisional winner and the wild card do not have home field. The Division Series used a 2\u20133 format until 1998 and now uses a 2\u20132\u20131 format. This is seen as a more fair distribution of home-field advantage because previously under the 2-3 format, the team hosting the first two games had absolutely no chance of winning the series at home. With the current 2-2-1 format however, ''both'' teams have the home-field advantage in a sense. While one team gets to host three games (including the critical first and last game), the other team does get two chances out of three (games 3 and 4) of winning the series on its home field.\n\nWith the adoption of the expanded playoff format in 2012, the five-game Division Series began with two home games for the lower seeds, followed by up to three home games for the higher seeds. This one-year change eliminated a travel day prior to a decisive Game 5 of a Division Series and was necessary because the 2012 regular-season schedule was announced before the agreement on the new postseason was reached. Since 2013, the Division Series restored the 2-2-1 format.\n\n=== Wild Card Game ===\nBefore 2012, the Wild Card team played the team with the best record that was not from their division. With the addition of a second Wild Card team the Wild Card Game was created. The Wild Card Game is a one game playoff to determine who advances to the next round of the playoffs to take on the team with the best overall record in their respective league. The 4th seeded team or 1st Wild Card hosts the 5th seeded or 2nd Wild Card. This has caused some controversy in that some people want a three game series to determine a winner instead of an elimination game to make the playoffs more fair. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thetylt.com/sports/mlb-wild-card-playoffs-single-elimination-three-game-series|title=Should the MLB Wild Card playoff be a 3 game series|last=Tran|first=Daniel|date=|website=The Tylt|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Postseason bonuses==\nThere are three factors that determine the actual amount of bonus money paid to any individual player: (1) the size of the bonus pool; (2) their team's success in the season/post-season; and (3) the share of the pool assigned to the individual player.\n\n===How the bonus pool is determined===\n\nThere is a separate pool for each series \u2013 the Wild Card games, the Division Series, the League Championship Series, and the World Series. The players' bonus pool is funded with 60% of the gate receipts for each of the Wild Card games, the first three games of each Division Series, the first four games of each LCS and the first four games of the World Series; limiting the funding for the pool to these games, the minimum number in each series, removes incentive to extend the series for merely fiscal sake. The value of the gate is determined by the size of the venues, the amount of high-priced premium seating in the venues, the number of games played in the series and whether the games sell out. Ticket prices for each series are set by MLB, not the home teams, so they are relatively uniform across baseball.\n\n===How much the winner and loser receives from each pool===\n\nThe World Series winner gets 36%, the World Series loser gets 24%, both League Championship Series losers get 12%, the four Division Series losers get 3.25%, and the two Wild Card playoff losers get 1.5%.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1012/the-economics-of-postseason-baseball.aspx|title=The Economics Of Postseason Baseball }} </ref>\n\n===How the team's share of the pool is divided===\n\nThe division of the team's share of the pool is voted upon by the players who have been on the team during the entire regular season, in a meeting chaired by their union representative. This meeting follows the trade deadline on July 31. Players who have been with the team for the full season automatically receive a full share.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://therocky.com/news/2007/Nov/27/rockies-vote-44-full-shares-from-playoff-pool/|title=Rockies vote 44 full shares from playoff pool|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130708174420/http://therocky.com/news/2007/Nov/27/rockies-vote-44-full-shares-from-playoff-pool/|archivedate=2013-07-08}}</ref>  At the meeting, the full-season players vote on whether anyone else\u2014including players who have not been with the team for the full season, coaches, and trainers\u2014is to be granted a full share, less than a full share, a cash award, or no share.  After the World Series, the pool of money is split according to the shares determined in the vote. There is no limit to the number of shares that may be granted, but a greater number of shares dilutes the value of each share, and consequently the amount each player is awarded.\n\nAs an example, playoff-pool full-share holders for the St. Louis Cardinals received {{US$|362183.97|2006}} each when the team won the World Series in 2006.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Babe Ruth Award]] (best player in the postseason; since 2007)\n*[[This Year in Baseball Awards#Awards|\"Esurance MLB Awards\" Best Major Leaguer, Postseason]]\n*[[Major League Baseball division winners|MLB division winners]]\n*[[Professional baseball]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{MLB}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Major League Baseball Postseason}}\n[[Category:Major League Baseball playoffs and champions|*]]\n[[Category:World Series|*]]\n[[Category:American League Championship Series|+]]\n[[Category:National League Championship Series|+]]\n[[Category:American League Division Series|*]]\n[[Category:National League Division Series|*]]\n[[Category:Annual events in Major League Baseball]]\n", "text_old": "\n\n{{Redirect|Major League Baseball playoffs|tie-breaker games|List of Major League Baseball tie-breakers}}\n{{MLB playoffs sidebar}}\nThe '''Major League Baseball postseason''' is an [[single-elimination tournament|elimination tournament]] held after the conclusion of the [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] regular season.

This single-tiered approach persisted through 1968, even with the [[History of baseball in the United States#1961\u20131962|expansions of 1961\u20131962]] that expanded both leagues to 10 teams.\n\n===1969\u20131993: Two rounds===\nIn 1969, both leagues expanded to twelve teams, which made it more difficult to compete for a league championship because there were more teams competing for the AL and NL pennants.

To remedy this, and imitating the other major sports' long-standing playoff traditions, Major League Baseball split each league into Eastern and Western divisions, creating four divisions overall and no worse than a sixth-place finish for any team in any division until later expansions in 1977 and 1993. This created a new postseason round, which was dubbed the [[League Championship Series]] (LCS), a [[playoff format#Best-of-five playoff|best-of-five]] series. In 1985 the LCS was expanded to a best-of-seven series.\n\nUnder this system, it was possible for one of the best teams in a league to be left out of the postseason if it didn't win its division.  Most notably, in {{mlby|1993}}, the [[1993 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] and [[1993 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] finished with the two best records in the majors, with 104 and 103 wins, respectively.

Since 2013, the Division Series restored the 2-2-1 format.\n\n==Postseason bonuses==\nThere are three factors that determine the actual amount of bonus money paid to any individual player: (1) the size of the bonus pool; (2) their team's success in the season/post-season; and (3) the share of the pool assigned to the individual player.\n\n===How the bonus pool is determined===\n\nThere is a separate pool for each series \u2013 the Wild Card games, the Division Series, the League Championship Series, and the World Series. The players' bonus pool is funded with 60% of the gate receipts for each of the Wild Card games, the first three games of each Division Series, the first four games of each LCS and the first four games of the World Series; limiting the funding for the pool to these games, the minimum number in each series, removes incentive to extend the series for merely fiscal sake. The value of the gate is determined by the size of the venues, the amount of high-priced premium seating in the venues, the number of games played in the series and whether the games sell out. Ticket prices for each series are set by MLB, not the home teams, so they are relatively uniform across baseball.\n\n===How much the winner and loser receives from each pool===\n\nThe World Series winner gets 36%, the World Series loser gets 24%, both League Championship Series losers get 12%, the four Division Series losers get 3.25%, and the two Wild Card playoff losers get 1.5%.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1012/the-economics-of-postseason-baseball.aspx|title=The Economics Of Postseason Baseball }} </ref>\n\n===How the team's share of the pool is divided===\n\nThe division of the team's share of the pool is voted upon by the players who have been on the team during the entire regular season, in a meeting chaired by their union representative. This meeting follows the trade deadline on July 31. Players who have been with the team for the full season automatically receive a full share.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://therocky.com/news/2007/Nov/27/rockies-vote-44-full-shares-from-playoff-pool/|title=Rockies vote 44 full shares from playoff pool|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130708174420/http://therocky.com/news/2007/Nov/27/rockies-vote-44-full-shares-from-playoff-pool/|archivedate=2013-07-08}}</ref>  At the meeting, the full-season players vote on whether anyone else\u2014including players who have not been with the team for the full season, coaches, and trainers\u2014is to be granted a full share, less than a full share, a cash award, or no share.  After the World Series, the pool of money is split according to the shares determined in the vote. There is no limit to the number of shares that may be granted, but a greater number of shares dilutes the value of each share, and consequently the amount each player is awarded.\n\nAs an example, playoff-pool full-share holders for the St. Louis Cardinals received {{US$|362183.97|2006}} each when the team won the World Series in 2006.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Babe Ruth Award]] (best player in the postseason; since 2007)\n*[[This Year in Baseball Awards#Awards|\"Esurance MLB Awards\" Best Major Leaguer, Postseason]]\n*[[Major League Baseball division winners|MLB division winners]]\n*[[Professional baseball]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{MLB}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Major League Baseball Postseason}}\n[[Category:Major League Baseball playoffs and champions|*]]\n[[Category:World Series|*]]\n[[Category:American League Championship Series|+]]\n[[Category:National League Championship Series|+]]\n[[Category:American League Division Series|*]]\n[[Category:National League Division Series|*]]\n[[Category:Annual events in Major League Baseball]]\n", "name_user": "Willster777", "label": "safe", "comment": "Adding information on the Wild Card game and the homefield advantage. ~~~", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason"}

{"title_page": "Gerard Brandt", "text_new": "[[Image:Gerard Brandt.JPG|thumb|200px|Gerard Brandt in 1683.]]\n\n'''Gerard Brandt''' (25 July 1626, [[Amsterdam]] &ndash; 12 October 1685, Amsterdam) was a Dutch [[preacher]], playwright, poet, church historian, biographer and naval historian. A well-known writer in his own time, his works include a ''Life of [[Michiel de Ruyter]]'' (1687, ''Het Leven en bedryf van den Heere Michiel de Ruiter'' - an important source on the admiral's life) and a ''Historie der vermaerde zee- en koopstadt [[Enkhuizen|Enkhuisen]]'' (1666, ''Geschiedenis van Enkhuizen'' - still an important source for that city's early history).\n\n==Life==\nBrandt was the son of the clockmaker Gerard Brandt and his wife Neeltje Jeroens. Aged 17 Gerard junior wrote the play ''De Veinzende Torquatus'', later put on in the [[Amsterdamse Schouwburg]], of which his father was [[regenten|regent]]. When he later became a well-known preacher and serious scholar, he did not want his youthful works and errors to be remembered. He was best known for his \"grafrede\" on [[P.C. Hooft|Pieter Cornelisz. Hooft]] in 1647, a translation of [[Jacques Du Perron]]'s eulogy of [[Pierre de Ronsard|Ronsard]] which he had performed by the actor Van Germez. He also continued his own work, in which he was accused of plagiarism in ''Aen den onbeschaemden letter-dief'', a speech in which he called Hooft \"the only poet Amstel has produced\", a clear attack on [[Joost van den Vondel|Vondel]].\n\n==Dutch historian and biographer==\nUnder the influence of professor [[Casparus Barlaeus]], and Barlaeus's daughter in particular, Brandt gave up studying watchmaking and in 1652 passed his exam, becoming a [[Remonstrant]] preacher in [[Nieuwkoop]]. He married Suzanne van Baerle and all three of their sons later became preachers. Brandt worked from 1660 to 1667 in [[Hoorn]], before moving to [[Amsterdam]]. In 1676 Michiel de Ruyter had died and in 1681 his son [[Engel de Ruyter]] commissioned a biography of him from Brandt for 400 guilder. Brandt received information for it from de Ruyter's widow and children, but it was left incomplete on Brandt's death in 1685 - Brandt's sons Caspar and Johannes completed it, publishing it as a 1,063 page volume in 1687.\n\n===Life of Vondel===\nHis exhaustive compilation of the works and biography of the Dutch Poet [[Joost van den Vondel]] earned him a place in the list of 1000 key texts of [[Dutch Literature]] in the [[Digital library for Dutch literature|DBNL]].<ref>See [[Canon of Dutch Literature]] under 1682</ref>\n\n===Life of Admiral Michiel de Ruyter===\nIn his work on the biographies of artists, [[Arnold Houbraken]] quotes Gerard Brand's biography,<ref>{{in lang|nl}}<!--Middle Dutch--> [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/houb005groo01_01/houb005groo01_01_0165.htm Willem vanden Velde biography] in ''De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen'' (1718) by [[Arnold Houbraken]], courtesy of the [[Digital library for Dutch literature]]</ref> relating the anecdote where [[Willem van de Velde the Elder]] asked Admiral de Ruyter permission to have a [[galley]] row him around for a good view of the proceedings on the evening of the sea battle in 1666, an event known as the [[Four Days Battle]]. He wasn't the only artist to paint the scenes of this battle:\n<gallery>\nFile:De krijgsraad aan boord van de 'De Zeven Provinci\u00ebn', het admiraalschip van Michiel Adriaensz de Ruyter, 10 juni 1666 (Willem van de Velde I, 1693).jpg|''Battle council on the [[Dutch ship De Zeven Provinci\u00ebn (1665)|De Zeven Provinci\u00ebn]]'' by [[Willem van de Velde the Elder]], 1666\nFile:Four days Battle mg 0504.jpg|HMS ''Swiftsure'', ''Seven Oaks'' and ''Loyal George'' captured and flying Dutch colours, by [[Willem van de Velde the Younger]]\nFile:Willem van de Velde (II) - De verovering van het Engelse admiraalschip de 'Royal Prince'.jpg|Willem van de Velde: ''The surrender of the ''Prince Royal''\nFile:Backhuisen-BattleofFourDays.jpg|''Battle at Texel, August 1673'' by [[Ludolf Bakhuysen]]\nFile:Van Soest, Four Days Battle.jpg|''Four day battle'' by [[Pieter Cornelisz van Soest]]\n</gallery>\nThis act later was the reason that van Velde gained his marine commission in [[London]] and shows how famous Admiral de Ruyter was in the blind faith that the artists (and the Dutch in general) had in him.

A well-known writer in his own time, his works include a ''Life of [[Michiel de Ruyter]]'' (1687, ''Het Leven en bedryf van den Heere Michiel de Ruiter'' - an important source on the admiral's life) and a ''Historie der vermaerde zee- en koopstadt [[Enkhuizen|Enkhuisen]]'' (1666, ''Geschiedenis van Enkhuizen'' - still an important source for that city's early history).\n\n==Life==\nBrandt was the son of the clockmaker Gerard Brandt and his wife Neeltje Jeroens. Aged 17 Gerard junior wrote the play ''De Veinzende Torquatus'', later put on in the [[Amsterdamse Schouwburg]], of which his father was [[regenten|regent]]. When he later became a well-known preacher and serious scholar, he did not want his youthful works and errors to be remembered. He was best known for his \"grafrede\" on [[P.C. Hooft|Pieter Cornelisz. Hooft]] in 1647, a translation of [[Jacques Du Perron]]'s eulogy of [[Pierre de Ronsard|Ronsard]] which he had performed by the actor Van Germez. He also continued his own work, in which he was accused of plagiarism in ''Aen den onbeschaemden letter-dief'', a speech in which he called Hooft \"the only poet Amstel has produced\", a clear attack on [[Joost van den Vondel|Vondel]].\n\n==Dutch historian and biographer==\nUnder the influence of professor [[Casparus Barlaeus]], and Barlaeus's daughter in particular, Brandt gave up studying watchmaking and in 1652 passed his exam, becoming a [[Remonstrant]] preacher in [[Nieuwkoop]]. He married Suzanne van Baerle and all three of their sons later became preachers. Brandt worked from 1660 to 1667 in [[Hoorn]], before moving to [[Amsterdam]]. In 1676 Michiel de Ruyter had died and in 1681 his son [[Engel de Ruyter]] commissioned a biography of him from Brandt for 400 guilder. Brandt received information for it from de Ruyter's widow and children, but it was left incomplete on Brandt's death in 1685 - Brandt's sons Caspar and Johannes completed it, publishing it as a 1,063 page volume in 1687.\n\n===Life of Vondel===\nHis exhaustive compilation of the works and biography of the Dutch Poet [[Joost van den Vondel]] earned him a place in the list of 1000 key texts of [[Dutch Literature]] in the [[Digital library for Dutch literature|DBNL]].<ref>See [[Canon of Dutch Literature]] under 1682</ref>\n\n===Life of Admiral Michiel de Ruyter===\nIn his work on the biographies of artists, [[Arnold Houbraken]] quotes Gerard Brand's biography,<ref>{{in lang|nl}}<!--Middle Dutch--> [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/houb005groo01_01/houb005groo01_01_0165.htm Willem vanden Velde biography] in ''De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen'' (1718) by [[Arnold Houbraken]], courtesy of the [[Digital library for Dutch literature]]</ref> relating the anecdote where [[Willem van de Velde the Elder]] asked Admiral de Ruyter permission to have a [[galley]] row him around for a good view of the proceedings on the evening of the sea battle in 1666, an event known as the [[Four Days Battle]]. He wasn't the only artist to paint the scenes of this battle:\n<gallery>\nFile:De krijgsraad aan boord van de 'De Zeven Provinci\u00ebn', het admiraalschip van Michiel Adriaensz de Ruyter, 10 juni 1666 (Willem van de Velde I, 1693).jpg|''Battle council on the [[Dutch ship De Zeven Provinci\u00ebn (1665)|De Zeven Provinci\u00ebn]]'' by [[Willem van de Velde the Elder]], 1666\nFile:Four days Battle mg 0504.jpg|HMS ''Swiftsure'', ''Seven Oaks'' and ''Loyal George'' captured and flying Dutch colours, by [[Willem van de Velde the Younger]]\nFile:Willem van de Velde (II) - De verovering van het Engelse admiraalschip de 'Royal Prince'.jpg|Willem van de Velde: ''The surrender of the ''Prince Royal''\nFile:Backhuisen-BattleofFourDays.jpg|''Battle at Texel, August 1673'' by [[Ludolf Bakhuysen]]\nFile:Van Soest, Four Days Battle.jpg|''Four day battle'' by [[Pieter Cornelisz van Soest]]\n</gallery>\nThis act later was the reason that van Velde gained his marine commission in [[London]] and shows how famous Admiral de Ruyter was in the blind faith that the artists (and the Dutch in general) had in him.

It is in this changing social sphere that concern over \"white slavery\" began.  This term referred to women being [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] for the purposes of prostitution.{{citation needed |date= June 2014}}\n\nNumerous communities appointed [[vice]] commissions to investigate the extent of local prostitution, whether prostitutes participated in it willingly or were forced into it, and the degree to which it was organized by any [[cartel]]-type organizations. The second significant action at the local level was to close the [[brothel]]s and the [[red light districts]]. From 1910 to 1913, city after city changed previously tolerant approaches and forced the closing of their brothels. Opposition to openly practiced prostitution had been growing steadily throughout the last decades of the 19th century. The federal government's response was the Mann Act.  The purpose of the act was to make it a crime to \"transport or cause to be transported, or aid to assist in obtaining transportation for\" or to \"persuade, induce, entice or coerce\" a woman to travel.<ref name= \"Brian K 2004\">{{cite book |first= Brian K |last= Landsberg |title= Major Acts of Congress |work= Macmillan Reference USA |publisher= Macmillan |location= London, [[England|ENG]] |date= 2004 |pages= 251\u201353}}</ref>  Many of the changes that occurred after 1900 were a result of tensions between social ideals and practical realities.

These white slave narratives, or white-slave tracts, began to circulate around 1909.\"<ref name= Bell1910 /> Such narratives often portrayed innocent girls \"victimized by a huge, secret and powerful conspiracy controlled by foreigners\", as they were drugged or imprisoned and forced into prostitution.{{citation needed|date= June 2014}}<ref name=Bell1910 />\n\n[[File:The First Step From Fighting the Traffic in Young Girls or the war on the white slave trade.jpg|thumb|\"Ice cream parlors of the city and fruit stores combined, largely run by foreigners, are the places where scores of girls have taken their first step downward.

A number of Vice Commission reports had drawn attention to the issue.<ref name= Bell1910 /> Some contemporaries questioned the idea of abduction and foreign control of prostitution through cartels. For example, noted radical and feminist [[Emma Goldman]] asked \"What is really the cause of the trade in women? Not merely white women, but yellow and black women as well. Exploitation, of course; the merciless Moloch of capitalism that fattens on underpaid labor, thus driving thousands of women and girls into prostitution.

Because it lacked specificity, it criminalized many who were not participating in prostitution. It became a way to persecute large numbers of unmarried couples participating in premarital or extramarital activities, especially when it involved crossing state lines such as in the cases for [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]].<ref name=ReferenceA>\"[https://www.pbs.org/unforgivableblackness/knockout/mann.html Unforgivable Blackness, Knockout].\" PBS. PBS, n.d. Web. 14 Nov. 2013.</ref> The Mann Act also became a form of blackmail, by wives who were suspicious of cheating husbands or other women. This was the case for both Drew Caminetti and Maury Diggs. Both men from Sacramento, California, were married, and took their mistresses Lola Norris and Marsha Warrington to Reno, Nevada. The men's wives contacted the police, and the men were arrested in Reno and found guilty under the Mann Act.<ref name=ReferenceA/> One author wrote:\n\n<blockquote>In 1914 a woman by the name of Jessie A. Cope was arrested in Chicago for attempting to bribe an official to assist her in the blackmail of Colonel Charles Alexander of Providence Rhode Island, on a white slavery charge. The two had met two years previous in LA, Alexander had promised to divorce his wife, and marry her. When he attempted to leave her, Cope and her mother pursued him to Providence. Cope consulted lawyers in Providence and LA, then brought the charges in Chicago, where she was arrested.<ref name=McLaren>McLaren, Angus. \"Entrapping the Jazz-Age American Male.\" ''Sexual Blackmail: A Modern History''. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2002. 87. Print.</ref></blockquote>\n\nUpon continuous blackmail accounts, ''[[The New York Times]]'' became an advocate against the Mann Act:\n\n<blockquote>In 1915 the paper published an editorial pointing out how the act led to extortion. In 1916 it labeled the Mann Act \"The Blackmail Act\", noting that its dangers had been clear from the start. The act made a harmless spree or simple elopement a crime, and the blackmail that resulted from the Mann Act was worse than the prostitution it sought to suppress.<ref name=McLaren/></blockquote>\n\nWhile the Mann Act has never been repealed, it has been amended and altered since its initial passing. The Mann Act continued essentially unchanged until 1978 amendments that expanded coverage to issues around [[child pornography]] and exploitation. Most recently, in 1986, the Mann Act was significantly altered to make the whole Act gender neutral and to redress the specific ambiguous phrasing that had enabled decades of unjust applications of the Act. With the 1986 amendments, the Mann Act outlaws interstate or foreign transport of \"any person\" for purposes of \"any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense.\"<ref>Langum, David J. \"Mann Act (1910).\" Major Acts of Congress. 2004.

|18|2421|2424}}). It is named after Congressman [[James Robert Mann (Illinois)|James Robert Mann]] of [[Illinois]].\n\nIn its original form the act made it a [[felony]] to engage in interstate or foreign commerce transport of \"any woman or girl for the purpose of [[prostitution]] or [[:wikt:debauchery|debauchery]], or for any other immoral purpose\". Its primary stated intent was to address prostitution, immorality, and [[human trafficking]], particularly where trafficking was for the purposes of prostitution. It was one of several acts of protective legislation aimed at moral reform during the [[Progressive Era]]. In practice, its [[ambiguity|ambiguous]] language about \"immorality\" resulted in it being used to criminalize even consensual sexual behavior between adults.<ref>{{Citation | title = Mann Act | work = Dictionary of American History | origyear = 2003 | publisher = Encyclopedia | date = 21 October 2013}}.</ref> It was amended by Congress in 1978 and again in 1986 to limit its application to transport for the purpose of prostitution or other illegal sexual acts.<ref name= Bell1910>{{Citation | last = Bell | first = Ernest Albert | via = Archive | url = https://archive.org/stream/fightingtraffici00bell#page/n5/mode/2up | title = The War on the White Slave Trade | place = Chicago | publisher = GS Ball | year = 1910 | format = ebook}}.</ref>\n\n==Promotion==\nIn the 19th century, many of America's cities had designated, legally protected [[red-light district|areas of prostitution]]; and increased urbanization as well as greater numbers of young women entering the workforce led to greater flexibility in [[courtship]] without supervision. It is in this changing social sphere that concern over \"white slavery\" began.  This term referred to women being [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] for the purposes of prostitution.{{citation needed |date= June 2014}}\n\nNumerous communities appointed [[vice]] commissions to investigate the extent of local prostitution, whether prostitutes participated in it willingly or were forced into it, and the degree to which it was organized by any [[cartel]]-type organizations. The second significant action at the local level was to close the [[brothel]]s and the [[red light districts]]. From 1910 to 1913, city after city changed previously tolerant approaches and forced the closing of their brothels. Opposition to openly practiced prostitution had been growing steadily throughout the last decades of the 19th century. The federal government's response was the Mann Act.  The purpose of the act was to make it a crime to \"transport or cause to be transported, or aid to assist in obtaining transportation for\" or to \"persuade, induce, entice or coerce\" a woman to travel.<ref name= \"Brian K 2004\">{{cite book |first= Brian K |last= Landsberg |title= Major Acts of Congress |work= Macmillan Reference USA |publisher= Macmillan |location= London, [[England|ENG]] |date= 2004 |pages= 251\u201353}}</ref>  Many of the changes that occurred after 1900 were a result of tensions between social ideals and practical realities.

These white slave narratives, or white-slave tracts, began to circulate around 1909.\"<ref name= Bell1910 /> Such narratives often portrayed innocent girls \"victimized by a huge, secret and powerful conspiracy controlled by foreigners\", as they were drugged or imprisoned and forced into prostitution.{{citation needed|date= June 2014}}<ref name=Bell1910 />\n\n[[File:The First Step From Fighting the Traffic in Young Girls or the war on the white slave trade.jpg|thumb|\"Ice cream parlors of the city and fruit stores combined, largely run by foreigners, are the places where scores of girls have taken their first step downward.

A number of Vice Commission reports had drawn attention to the issue.<ref name= Bell1910 /> Some contemporaries questioned the idea of abduction and foreign control of prostitution through cartels. For example, noted radical and feminist [[Emma Goldman]] asked \"What is really the cause of the trade in women? Not merely white women, but yellow and black women as well. Exploitation, of course; the merciless Moloch of capitalism that fattens on underpaid labor, thus driving thousands of women and girls into prostitution.

Thus polygamous marriage was determined to be an \"immoral purpose\".\n*''[[Bell v. United States]]'', {{ussc|349|81|1955}}. The Supreme Court decided that simultaneous transportation of two women across state lines constituted only one violation of the Mann Act, not two violations.\n\n==Congressional amendments to the law==\nIn 1978, Congress updated the act's definition of \"transportation\" and added protections against commercial sexual exploitation for minors. It added a 1986 amendment which further protected minors and added protection for adult males. In particular, as part of a larger 1986 bill focused on criminalizing various aspects of [[child pornography]] that passed unanimously in both houses of Congress,<ref name=SFchron1986>\"[[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] Signs Tough Bill In Crackdown on Child Porn\". [[United Press International]] (via the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'') November 8, 1986. \"President Reagan signed a bill yesterday strengthening provisions of existing child pornography laws. The new measure, passed unanimously by both houses of Congress, would make it a crime to advertise to buy or sell child pornography, to seek children for the production of pornography or to participate with children in the production of it. <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> On another subject, the bill rewrites the Mann Act, a relic of the early part of the century, which makes it a crime to transport a woman across state lines for 'immoral' purposes. The new provision makes the statute gender-neutral and eliminates archaic language.\"</ref> the Mann act was further amended to replace the ambiguous \"debauchery\" and \"any other immoral purpose\" with the more specific \"any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense\" as well as to make it gender-neutral.<ref name=SFchron1986/>\n\n{|style=\"border:1px solid gray; align:left; width:70%\" cellspacing=3 cellpadding=0\n|-style=\"font-weight:bold; text-align:center; background:#bbddff; color:black;\"\n! style=\" border-bottom:1.5px solid black\"|Date of Enactment\n! style=\" border-bottom:1.5px solid black\"|Public Law Number\n! style=\" border-bottom:1.5px solid black\"|U.S. Statute Citation\n! style=\" border-bottom:1.5px solid black\"|U.S. Legislative Bill\n! style=\" border-bottom:1.5px solid black\"|U.S. Presidential Administration\n|-\n| style=\"border-bottom:1px solid gray; background:#F5F5F5;\"|June 25, 1948\n| style=\"border-bottom:1px solid gray; background:#F5F5F5; text-align:center;\"|P.L. 80-772\n| style=\"border-bottom:1px solid gray; background:#F5F5F5; text-align:center;\"|{{usstat|62|683}}\n| style=\"border-bottom:1px solid gray; background:#F5F5F5; text-align:center;\"|{{USBill|80|H.R.|3190}}\n| style=\"border-bottom:1px solid gray; background:#F5F5F5; text-align:center;\"|Harry S.

Because it lacked specificity, it criminalized many who were not participating in prostitution. It became a way to persecute large numbers of unmarried couples participating in premarital or extramarital activities, especially when it involved crossing state lines such as in the cases for [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]].<ref name=ReferenceA>\"[https://www.pbs.org/unforgivableblackness/knockout/mann.html Unforgivable Blackness, Knockout].\" PBS. PBS, n.d. Web. 14 Nov. 2013.</ref> The Mann Act also became a form of blackmail, by wives who were suspicious of cheating husbands or other women. This was the case for both Drew Caminetti and Maury Diggs. Both men from Sacramento, California, were married, and took their mistresses Lola Norris and Marsha Warrington to Reno, Nevada. The men's wives contacted the police, and the men were arrested in Reno and found guilty under the Mann Act.<ref name=ReferenceA/> One author wrote:\n\n<blockquote>In 1914 a woman by the name of Jessie A. Cope was arrested in Chicago for attempting to bribe an official to assist her in the blackmail of Colonel Charles Alexander of Providence Rhode Island, on a white slavery charge. The two had met two years previous in LA, Alexander had promised to divorce his wife, and marry her. When he attempted to leave her, Cope and her mother pursued him to Providence. Cope consulted lawyers in Providence and LA, then brought the charges in Chicago, where she was arrested.<ref name=McLaren>McLaren, Angus. \"Entrapping the Jazz-Age American Male.\" ''Sexual Blackmail: A Modern History''. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2002. 87. Print.</ref></blockquote>\n\nUpon continuous blackmail accounts, ''[[The New York Times]]'' became an advocate against the Mann Act:\n\n<blockquote>In 1915 the paper published an editorial pointing out how the act led to extortion. In 1916 it labeled the Mann Act \"The Blackmail Act\", noting that its dangers had been clear from the start. The act made a harmless spree or simple elopement a crime, and the blackmail that resulted from the Mann Act was worse than the prostitution it sought to suppress.<ref name=McLaren/></blockquote>\n\nWhile the Mann Act has never been repealed, it has been amended and altered since its initial passing. The Mann Act continued essentially unchanged until 1978 amendments that expanded coverage to issues around [[child pornography]] and exploitation. Most recently, in 1986, the Mann Act was significantly altered to make the whole Act gender neutral and to redress the specific ambiguous phrasing that had enabled decades of unjust applications of the Act. With the 1986 amendments, the Mann Act outlaws interstate or foreign transport of \"any person\" for purposes of \"any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense.\"<ref>Langum, David J. \"Mann Act (1910).\" Major Acts of Congress. 2004.

Texas]]'' (2003), [[sodomy laws|sodomy was illegal]] in many states which left open the possibility of prosecution under the Mann Act of consenting adult couples, especially gay couples, though there is no record of such enforcement actions.<ref name=Langum1994/> Since 1978 most prosecutions have been related to child abuse and child trafficking cases.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Caminetti v.

{"title_page": "Joan Blasius", "text_new": "'''Joan Leonardszoon Blasius''' (13 April 1639 \u2014 6 December 1672) was a Dutch poet, playwright, translator and lawyer.  Born near [[Cadzand]] in [[Oostvliet]], a village now lost to the North Sea, he was the younger brother of the famous doctor [[Gerard Blasius]].\n\nBlasius in 1670 became director of the Amsterdam Municipal Theatre, the [[Stadsschouwburg Amsterdam|Amsterdamse Schouwburg]], but because of this powerful position as well as the romantic nature of his works for the theatre, he incurred the enmity of the tradition oriented theatre company \"Nil volentibus arduum\".
