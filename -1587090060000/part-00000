These followed smaller protests in late 2011. Protests were based on concerns that the bills, intended to provide more robust responses to [[copyright infringement]] (also known as piracy) arising outside the United States, contained measures that could possibly infringe online freedom of speech, websites, and Internet communities. Protesters also argued that there were insufficient safeguards in place to protect sites based upon [[user-generated content]].\n\nThe move to a formal protest was initiated when some websites, including [[Reddit]] and the [[English Wikipedia]], considered temporarily closing their content and redirecting users to a message opposing the proposed legislation. Others, such as [[Google]], [[Mozilla]], and [[Flickr]], soon featured protests against the acts. Some shut down completely, while others kept some or all of their content accessible. According to protest organizer [[Fight for the Future]], more than 115,000 websites joined the Internet protest.<ref name=\"NYT 19 Jan\">Wortham, Jenna (2012-01-19).

The protests were reported globally.\n\nThe January protest, initially planned to coincide with the first SOPA hearing of the year, drew publicity and reaction.

Both are responses to the problem of enforcement of U.S. laws against websites outside U.S. jurisdiction. While the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA) and other existing laws have generally been considered effective against illegal content or activities on U.S.-based sites,<ref name=\"cnnmoney\">{{cite news | url = http://money.cnn.com/2012/01/17/technology/sopa_explained/ | title=  SOPA explained: What it is and why it matters | publisher = [[CNNMoney]] | date = 2012-01-17 | accessdate = 2012-01-17 | first =  Julianne | last = Pepitone }}</ref> action is more difficult against overseas websites.<ref name=\"cnnmoney\" /> SOPA and PIPA proposed to rectify this by cutting off infringing sites from their U.S.-based funding (particularly [[Internet advertising|advertising]]), [[payment processor]]s, appearances on [[search engine]]s, and visibility on [[web browser]]s, instead. Major providers of all these services are predominantly U.S.-based. Notably, the provisions also involved modifying the [[Domain Name System|DNS system]], a crucial service that underpins the entire Internet and allows computers to locate each other reliably around the world.\n\nSupporters included, but were not limited to, media companies and industry associations such as the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] and the [[Entertainment Software Association]]. Supporters generally identified a need to have more effective laws to combat the illegal domestic sales of products and services, the counterfeiting and sale of products (such as prescription drugs, athletic shoes, and cosmetics), and worldwide copyright infringing activities which were problematic to prevent inasmuch as they originated outside the United States.\n\nThose opposed included a mixture of technology and Internet firms and associations, content creators such as the [[Wikipedia community]], [[free software]] authors, [[free speech]] organizations, lawmakers, and other websites and organizations, as well as members of the public using their services. They generally identified two main areas of severe side-effects: (1) effects on Internet websites, communities and user-generated content, and (2) effects on critically fundamental internet architecture and security:\n\n* ''Effects on websites, web communities and user-generated content'' - The scope, language, definitions, procedures, remedies, and provision for [[Immunity from prosecution|immunity]] following wrongful allegations was seen as insufficiently narrow and well-defined. Legal analysts suggested that draconian court orders could be obtained without undue difficulty to \"take down\" an entire site, without dialog or notification, due process, or liability for compensation if incorrect, even if the site were legitimate.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/were-sorry-youre-not-allowed-to-read-this/blog/38656/ | title=We're sorry, you're not allowed to read this | publisher=Greenpeace | date=January 17, 2012 | accessdate=January 23, 2012 | author=Naidoo, Kumi}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=January 2012}}<!--\n\nThe original text stated as an example:\n \"For example, what entails 'deliberate actions to avoid confirming a high probability' for a website?\"\n\nWe need a cited source, can anyone find a good example to add?\n\n--> Perceived consequences included serious [[Internet censorship|undermining of free speech on the Internet]], devastation of the Internet's communities, and widespread closure and [[chilling effect (law)|chilling]] of websites, particularly those including user-created content or organizations such as [[public library|libraries]] providing reference information.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rapp|first=David|title=DPLA, Syracuse, Library Blogs Take Part in SOPA/PIPA Protest|url=http://www.thedigitalshift.com/2012/01/copyright/dpla-syracuse-library-blogs-take-part-in-sopapipa-protest/|publisher=thedigitalshift.com (Library journal)|accessdate=2012-01-22|date=2012-01-18|quote=''The website of the Digital Public Library of America has a statement saying that the legislation 'would force libraries to censor access to [written, recorded, and visual] culture, expose librarians to criminal penalties for doing their jobs'...''}}</ref> Observers also noted the laws could be used strategically against legitimate competitors or during [[election]]s.<ref name=\"Berners-Lee\" />\n\n* ''Effects on critical Internet architecture'' - Technical experts testified that the proposed DNS measures conflicted with the [[critical Internet infrastructure|fundamental basis of the Internet]] and would \"break\" ongoing attempts to make the net more secure against malicious use.\n\n[[Google]]'s policy director, Bob Boorstin, stated that a site like [[YouTube]] supporting user-generated content \"would just go dark immediately\" to comply with the legislation.<ref name=\"cnnmoney\"/> [[Tumblr]], one of the first websites active in grassroots activism against the bills, added a feature that \"censored\" its website on November 16, 2011, and the [[social media]] aggregator [[Reddit]] also became deeply involved.<ref name=\"NYT 19 Jan\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118140002/http://www.reddit.com/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-01-18|title=blackout|date=2012-01-18|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref>\n\n=== Legislative and protest timeline ===\nOn November 16, 2011, a first hearing by the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|U.S. House Judiciary Committee]] was marked by online protests involving blackened website banners, popularly described as \"American Censorship Day\".\n\nOn December 15, 2011, the first House Judiciary Committee [[markup (legislation)|mark-up hearing]] took place for SOPA, prior to its eventual move to the House floor.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pcworld.com/article/246093/house_panel_to_move_forward_on_stop_online_piracy_act.html | title = House Panel to Move Forward on Stop Online Piracy Act | first = Grant | last = Gross | date = 2011-12-12 | accessdate = 2012-01-17 | work = [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] }}</ref>  During the markup session, several proposed amendments to address technological and other concerns were defeated.

These followed smaller protests in late 2011. Protests were based on concerns that the bills, intended to provide more robust responses to [[copyright infringement]] (also known as piracy) arising outside the United States, contained measures that could possibly infringe online freedom of speech, websites, and Internet communities. Protesters also argued that there were insufficient safeguards in place to protect sites based upon [[user-generated content]].\n\nThe move to a formal protest was initiated when some websites, including [[Reddit]] and the [[English Wikipedia]], considered temporarily closing their content and redirecting users to a message opposing the proposed legislation. Others, such as [[Google]], [[Mozilla]], and [[Flickr]], soon featured protests against the acts. Some shut down completely, while others kept some or all of their content accessible. According to protest organizer [[Fight for the Future]], more than 115,000 websites joined the Internet protest.<ref name=\"NYT 19 Jan\">Wortham, Jenna (2012-01-19).

Both are responses to the problem of enforcement of U.S. laws against websites outside U.S. jurisdiction. While the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA) and other existing laws have generally been considered effective against illegal content or activities on U.S.-based sites,<ref name=\"cnnmoney\">{{cite news | url = http://money.cnn.com/2012/01/17/technology/sopa_explained/ | title=  SOPA explained: What it is and why it matters | publisher = [[CNNMoney]] | date = 2012-01-17 | accessdate = 2012-01-17 | first =  Julianne | last = Pepitone }}</ref> action is more difficult against overseas websites.<ref name=\"cnnmoney\" /> SOPA and PIPA proposed to rectify this by cutting off infringing sites from their U.S.-based funding (particularly [[Internet advertising|advertising]]), [[payment processor]]s, appearances on [[search engine]]s, and visibility on [[web browser]]s, instead. Major providers of all these services are predominantly U.S.-based. Notably, the provisions also involved modifying the [[Domain Name System|DNS system]], a crucial service that underpins the entire Internet and allows computers to locate each other reliably around the world.\n\nSupporters included, but were not limited to, media companies and industry associations such as the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] and the [[Entertainment Software Association]]. Supporters generally identified a need to have more effective laws to combat the illegal domestic sales of products and services, the counterfeiting and sale of products (such as prescription drugs, athletic shoes, and cosmetics), and worldwide copyright infringing activities which were problematic to prevent inasmuch as they originated outside the United States.\n\nThose opposed included a mixture of technology and Internet firms and associations, content creators such as the [[Wikipedia community]], [[free software]] authors, [[free speech]] organizations, lawmakers, and other websites and organizations, as well as members of the public using their services. They generally identified two main areas of severe side-effects: (1) effects on Internet websites, communities and user-generated content, and (2) effects on critically fundamental internet architecture and security:\n\n* ''Effects on websites, web communities and user-generated content'' - The scope, language, definitions, procedures, remedies, and provision for [[Immunity from prosecution|immunity]] following wrongful allegations was seen as insufficiently narrow and well-defined. Legal analysts suggested that draconian court orders could be obtained without undue difficulty to \"take down\" an entire site, without dialog or notification, due process, or liability for compensation if incorrect, even if the site were legitimate.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/were-sorry-youre-not-allowed-to-read-this/blog/38656/ | title=We're sorry, you're not allowed to read this | publisher=Greenpeace | date=January 17, 2012 | accessdate=January 23, 2012 | author=Naidoo, Kumi}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=January 2012}}<!--\n\nThe original text stated as an example:\n \"For example, what entails 'deliberate actions to avoid confirming a high probability' for a website?\"\n\nWe need a cited source, can anyone find a good example to add?\n\n--> Perceived consequences included serious [[Internet censorship|undermining of free speech on the Internet]], devastation of the Internet's communities, and widespread closure and [[chilling effect (law)|chilling]] of websites, particularly those including user-created content or organizations such as [[public library|libraries]] providing reference information.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rapp|first=David|title=DPLA, Syracuse, Library Blogs Take Part in SOPA/PIPA Protest|url=http://www.thedigitalshift.com/2012/01/copyright/dpla-syracuse-library-blogs-take-part-in-sopapipa-protest/|publisher=thedigitalshift.com (Library journal)|accessdate=2012-01-22|date=2012-01-18|quote=''The website of the Digital Public Library of America has a statement saying that the legislation 'would force libraries to censor access to [written, recorded, and visual] culture, expose librarians to criminal penalties for doing their jobs'...''}}</ref> Observers also noted the laws could be used strategically against legitimate competitors or during [[election]]s.<ref name=\"Berners-Lee\" />\n\n* ''Effects on critical Internet architecture'' - Technical experts testified that the proposed DNS measures conflicted with the [[critical Internet infrastructure|fundamental basis of the Internet]] and would \"break\" ongoing attempts to make the net more secure against malicious use.\n\n[[Google]]'s policy director, Bob Boorstin, stated that a site like [[YouTube]] supporting user-generated content \"would just go dark immediately\" to comply with the legislation.<ref name=\"cnnmoney\"/> [[Tumblr]], one of the first websites active in grassroots activism against the bills, added a feature that \"censored\" its website on November 16, 2011, and the [[social media]] aggregator [[Reddit]] also became deeply involved.<ref name=\"NYT 19 Jan\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118140002/http://www.reddit.com/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-01-18|title=blackout|date=2012-01-18|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref>\n\n=== Legislative and protest timeline ===\nOn November 16, 2011, a first hearing by the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|U.S. House Judiciary Committee]] was marked by online protests involving blackened website banners, popularly described as \"American Censorship Day\".\n\nOn December 15, 2011, the first House Judiciary Committee [[markup (legislation)|mark-up hearing]] took place for SOPA, prior to its eventual move to the House floor.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pcworld.com/article/246093/house_panel_to_move_forward_on_stop_online_piracy_act.html | title = House Panel to Move Forward on Stop Online Piracy Act | first = Grant | last = Gross | date = 2011-12-12 | accessdate = 2012-01-17 | work = [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] }}</ref>  During the markup session, several proposed amendments to address technological and other concerns were defeated.

It is coordinated by the [[Multi-State Lottery Association]] (MUSL), a [[nonprofit organization]] formed by an agreement with US lotteries. Powerball's minimum advertised jackpot is $40 million (annuity); Powerball's annuity is paid in 30 [[graduated payments|graduated installments]] or winners may choose a lump sum payment instead. One lump sum payment will be less than the total of the 30 annual payments because of the [[time value of money]] and also because one check for a much larger sum will be taxed at a greater rate than 30 checks each at a much lower sum will be taxed.\n\nDrawings for Powerball are held every Wednesday and Saturday evening at 10:59 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]. Since October 7, 2015, the game has used a 5/69 (white balls) + 1/26 (Powerballs) matrix from which winning numbers are chosen, resulting in odds of 1 in 292,201,338 of winning a jackpot per play.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/01/13/how-powerball-manipulated-the-odds-to-make-a-1-5-billion-jackpot-happen |title=How Powerball manipulated the odds to create a $1.5864 billion jackpot |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=January 13, 2016}}</ref> Each play costs $2 or $3 with the ''Power Play'' option.

The game, and name, were changed to Powerball on April 19, 1992; its first drawing was held April 22.\n\n=== Powerball begins ===\nWhen it was launched in 1992 Powerball became the first game to use two drums. Using two drums to draw numbers from offers more manipulation by simultaneously allowing high jackpot odds, numerous prize levels and low overall odds of winning (as explained later, a ticket can win by matching only one number). The two-drum concept was suggested by Steve Caputo of the Oregon Lottery. The two-drum concept has since been used by ''The Big Game'' (now [[Mega Millions]]) in the US, [[Powerball (Australia)|Australia's Powerball]], [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|Thunderball]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Eurojackpot]] and [[EuroMillions]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThrough 2008, Powerball drawings usually were held at Screenscape Studios in [[West Des Moines, Iowa]]. The drawings' host was longtime Iowa radio personality Mike Pace, who had hosted MUSL drawings since Lotto America began in 1988. In 1996, Powerball went \"on the road\" for the first time, holding five remote drawings at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in Atlanta. A few weeks later, Georgia became the only jurisdiction to leave Powerball (Maine, which joined MUSL in 1990, left when Powerball began). In August 1996, Georgia joined the then-new ''The Big Game'', then the other major U.S. lottery group. It planned to sell tickets for ''both'' games for the rest of 1996; but within days Georgia was removed from MUSL, not to return until the 2010 cross-sell expansion.\n\nOn November 2, 1997, the [[Annuity (American)|annuity]] was changed from 20 to 25 yearly payments; the cash option was added.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://powerball.com/pb_history.asp |title=History |publisher=Powerball |accessdate=April 14, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201013549/http://powerball.com/pb_history.asp |archive-date=2018-02-01 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The annuity comprises 30 graduated payments, increasing 5% annually.\n\nIn 1998, [[Florida Lottery|Florida]] was given permission by its government to participate in a multi-state game. It was set to offer Powerball; but in early 1999, new governor [[Jeb Bush]] prevented Florida from joining since he believed Powerball would hurt the existing Florida Lottery games. In 2008, Governor [[Charlie Crist]] finally allowed Florida to join MUSL, on Jan 4, 2009.\n\nOn March 7, 2001, an optional multiplier (called ''Power Play'') was added, allowing players to multiply non-jackpot winnings by up to five by paying an extra $1 per game. A wheel was introduced to select the ''Power Play'' multiplier for each drawing (the next year, the ''1x'' was removed from the ''Power Play'' wheel.)\n\n=== 2009: Florida became host to drawings ===\nWith the start of Powerball sales in Florida on January 4, 2009 (with its first drawing on January 7), the matrices changed to 5/59 + 1/39 (adding four white ball numbers and dropping three red balls). This changed the jackpot probability from 1:146 million to 1:195 million; the overall probability became 1:35.\n\nBased on statistical projections, the average jackpot win increased from $95 million to $141 million. Over 3.5 million additional prizes were expected to be won yearly due to the change in probability. The starting jackpot increased to $20 million, with minimum rollovers of $5 million. The jackpot contribution increased from 30.3% to 32.5% of total sales. The Power Play option was modified; second prize, usually $200,000, was given an automatic 5x multiplier, making the 5+0 prize $1 million cash. The bonus second prize if the jackpot exceeded its previous record by $25 million, triggered only twice, was eliminated with the 2012 format change.\n\nThe conditions for Florida joining Powerball included a move of the live drawings from Iowa to [[Universal Studios Florida|Universal Studios]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} The three hosts rotating announcing duties from Universal Studios were Tracy Wiu, Elizabeth Hart and Scott Adams (MUSL headquarters remained in Iowa, where its other draws are held). The wheel that was used to determine the Power Play multiplier was retired when the drawings moved to Florida; a [[Random number generation|random number generator]] (RNG) was used until the 2012 format change.\n\n[[Arkansas Scholarship Lottery|Arkansas]] became the 33rd MUSL member on October 31, 2009,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arkansasmatters.com/content/news/Lottery_Fulltext?cid=258812 |accessdate=2016-02-09 |df=mdy-all }}{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> the last to join before the 2010 cross-sell expansion. The Ohio Lottery added Powerball on April 16, 2010, it joined [[Mega Millions]] (along with New York) years earlier, when ''The Big Game'' added ''Mega Millions'' to its name.\n\n=== 2010 cross-sell expansion ===\nIn March 2009, it was reported that [[New Jersey]], already a Mega Millions member, sought permission to join Powerball. Shortly after, discussions were revealed about allowing each US lottery to offer both games. On October 13, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL reached an agreement in principle to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://megamillions.com/mcenter/pressrelease.asp?newsID=D0CC83C2-97D5-4E0F-9FD4-E6945DCB0B98 |title=Mega Millions Official Home |publisher=Megamillions.com |date=October 13, 2009 |accessdate=April 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714070121/http://megamillions.com/mcenter/pressrelease.asp?newsID=D0CC83C2-97D5-4E0F-9FD4-E6945DCB0B98 |archivedate=July 14, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> In November, MUSL signed an agreement to start streaming Powerball drawings online.<ref>[http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=137273 \"Powerball Lottery Drawings to Be Available Live on the Internet\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101103/http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=137273 |date=March 4, 2016 }}, TransWorldNews, November 9, 2009.

The U.S. Virgin Islands joined Mega Millions in October 2010.\n\nBefore the agreement, the only places that sold both Mega Millions and Powerball tickets were retailers straddling a border; one retailer on the [[Sharon, Pennsylvania]]/[[Masury, Ohio]] border sold both Mega Millions (via the [[Ohio Lottery]]) and Powerball ([[Pennsylvania]]) before the agreement and continued to be the only retailer to sell tickets for both lotteries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://local.post-gazette.com/penn+ohio+lottery+and+deli.9.118177023p.home.html |title=Penn Ohio Lottery & Deli in Sharon, PA 16146 |publisher=Local.post-gazette.com |accessdate=September 4, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029203254/http://local.post-gazette.com/penn+ohio+lottery+and+deli.9.118177023p.home.html |archivedate=October 29, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[Illinois]] joining Powerball on the expansion date, it became the second multi-jurisdictional lottery game (after Mega Millions, which Illinois already participated in) whose drawings were carried nationally. Both games' drawings were simulcast via [[Chicago]] cable [[superstation]] [[WGN-TV]] through its national [[WGN America]] feed. WGN-TV aired Illinois Lottery drawings nationally from 1992 to 2015 after acquiring broadcast rights from Chicago's Fox [[owned-and-operated station]] [[WFLD]] in 1988, which took the rights from WGN-TV in 1987. Powerball drawings were aired on WGN-TV and WGN America on Wednesday and Saturday immediately following the station's 9:00 p.m. ([[Central Time Zone|Central Time]]) newscast with the Mega Millions drawings being aired Tue and Fri evenings after the newscast. WGN served as a default carrier of Mega Millions or Powerball where no local television station carries either multi-jurisdictional lottery's drawings.\n\nOn March 13, 2010, New Jersey became the first previous Mega Millions-only member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Powerball ticket. It was worth over $211 million in annuity payments; it was sold in [[Morris Plains, New Jersey|Morris Plains]]. On May 28, 2010, North Carolina became the first previous MUSL member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Mega Millions ticket; that jackpot was $12 million (annuity).\n\nOn June 2, 2010, Ohio won a Powerball jackpot; it became the first lottery selling ''either'' Mega Millions ''or'' Powerball (when 2010 began) to provide a jackpot-winning ticket for its newer game. The ticket was worth a $261 million annuity; it was sold in [[Sunbury, Ohio|Sunbury]]. Ohio's second Powerball jackpot-winning ticket, sold for the June 23, 2010 drawing, was part of another first; since Montana also provided a jackpot winner for that drawing, it was the first time a jackpot was shared through lotteries which sold competing games before the cross-selling expansion, as Montana sold only Powerball before the expansion date.\n\n=== 2012 format change ===\nOn January 15, 2012, the price of each basic Powerball play doubled to $2, while PowerPlay games became $3; the minimum jackpot doubled to $40 million.<ref name=\"worldlottery\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldlottery.net/news/powerball-lottery-changes-2012.asp|title=Powerball Lottery Changes for 2012|author=Lotto, Lucy|date=June 30, 2011|publisher=WorldLottery.net|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823062810/http://www.worldlottery.net/news/powerball-lottery-changes-2012.asp|archivedate=August 23, 2013|url-status=dead|accessdate=September 4, 2013|quote=The first and biggest change to the Powerball Lottery is the introduction of the $40 million base jackpot.

In each game, players select five numbers from a set of 69 white balls and one number from 26 red Powerballs; the red ball number can be the same as one of the white balls. The drawing order of the five white balls is irrelevant; all tickets show the white ball numbers in ascending order. Players cannot use the drawn Powerball to match two of their white numbers, or vice versa. Players can select their own numbers, or have the terminal [[Pseudorandomness|pseudorandomly]] select the numbers (called \"quick pick\", \"easy pick\", etc.).\n\nIn each drawing, winning numbers are selected using two ball machines: one containing the white balls and the other containing the red Powerballs. Five white balls are drawn from the first machine and the red ball from the second machine. Games matching at least three white balls or the red Powerball win.\n\nTwo identical machines are used for each drawing, randomly selected from four sets. The model of machine used is the Halogen, manufactured by Smartplay International of [[Edgewater Park, New Jersey]]. There are eight ball sets (four of each color); one set of each color is randomly selected before a drawing. The balls are mixed by a turntable at the bottom of the machine that propels the balls around the chamber. When the machine selects a ball, the turntable slows to catch it, sends it up the shaft, and then down the rail to the display. (The Florida Lottery is considering switching to a [[random number generator]] in 2019 for its in-state drawings; it is unknown whether Powerball would be affected.) If the onsite location is unavailable, as was the case during [[Hurricane Michael]], a backup machine is located at MUSL headquarters in Iowa.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/10/10/hurricane-michael-ran-million-powerball-drawing-out-town</ref>\n\nThe double matrices and probabilities in the game's history:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Starting date\n!Pick 5 White Balls from Field of\n!Pick 1 Red Ball from Field of\n!Jackpot chance\n!''Power Play'' multiplier\n|-\n|April 22, 1992\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|45\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|45\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:54,979,154\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\u2020\n|-\n|November 5, 1997\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|49\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:80,089,127\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\u2020\n|-\n|March 7, 2001\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|49\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:80,089,127\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1x-5x\n|-\n|October 9, 2002\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|53\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:120,526,769\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|August 28, 2005\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|55\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:146,107,961\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|January 7, 2009\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|39\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:195,249,054\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|January 15, 2012\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|35\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:175,223,510\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\n|-\n|January 19, 2014\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|35\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:175,223,510\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|October 7, 2015 <ref name=\"cnbc2015\">[https://nddb.coop/ccnddb/1024 Odds are, you won't like this Powerball story]{{Retrieved | accessdate=2015-07-09}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|69\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|26\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:292,201,338\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x; 10x\u2021\n|}\n\n\u2020''Power Play'' was introduced in 2001.<br />\n\u202110\u00d7 available if jackpot is under $150 million.<ref name=LotteryWorld2015/>\n\nWhile Mega Millions and Powerball each have similar jackpot odds despite having a different double matrix (Mega Millions is 5/75&nbsp;+&nbsp;1/15), since Powerball is $2 per play, it now takes $584,402,676 (not counting Power Play side bets) on average to produce a jackpot-winning ticket.\n\n=== Power Play ===\nFor an additional $1 per game, a player may activate the Power Play option. Activating it multiplies lower-tier winnings (base prize $50,000 or less) by up to 5, or 10 when the jackpot is under $150 million. Power Play is drawn separately from the 6 numbers. The 5+0 prize is automatically doubled to $2 million if Power Play is activated.\n\nThe dilemma for players is whether to maximize the chance at the jackpot or increase lower-tier winnings. If a player selects a fixed amount of money to spend on tickets at a certain time, the player will give up one guess of the winning set of numbers every two times this player activates Power Play in respect of one of the purchased tickets.\n\nPower Play, when it began in 2001, was drawn with a special wheel. In 2006 and 2007, MUSL replaced one of the 5\u00d7 spaces on the Power Play wheel with a 10\u00d7. During each month-long promotion, MUSL guaranteed that there would be at least one drawing with a 10\u00d7 multiplier. The promotion returned in 2008; the ball landed in the 10\u00d7 space twice. After being absent in 2009, the 10\u00d7 multiplier returned in May 2010 (after the Power Play drawing was changed to RNG.) The promotion was extended for the only time, as the 10\u00d7 multiplier was not drawn until June 12, 2010. The second prize 5\u00d7 guarantee continued; the 10\u00d7 applied to all non-jackpot prizes, as in previous promotions.\n\nPower Play's success has led to similar multipliers in other games, most notably ''Megaplier'', available through all [[Mega Millions]] members except California. The 2012 Powerball changes resulted in all eight lower-tier levels having \"fixed\" Power Play prizes.<ref name=\"Changes Coming to Powerball\">{{cite web |url=http://www.powerball.com/pb_message.asp |title=Changes Coming to Powerball... |publisher=Multi-State Lottery Association |accessdate=January 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123094841/http://www.powerball.com/pb_message.asp |archivedate=January 23, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nOn January 19, 2014, PowerPlay was modified; it used 30 balls with the following distribution:\n*2x (15)\n*3x (9)\n*4x/5x: 3 each\n\nOn October 4, 2015, PowerPlay changed again, using 42 or 43\u2020 balls as follows:\n*2x (24)\n*3x (13)\n*4x (3)\n*5x (2)\n*10x (1)\u2020\n\n\u2020 10x available when jackpot is under $150 million.\n\n=== Prizes and odds ===\n\nPayouts as of October 7, 2015:<ref>{{cite web |title=NEW YORK STATE GAMING COMMISSION AMENDMENT OF SECTIONS 5004.9, 5007.2, 5007.13, 5007.15, 5007.16, 5009.2 and 5010.2 OF NEW YORK CODES, RULES AND REGULATIONS TITLE 9, SUBTITLE T, CHAPTER III, SUBCHAPTER A |url=http://www.gaming.ny.gov/pdf/Proposed%20rulemaking%20for%20Powerball%20Amendments%20and%20Amendments%20to%20Other%20Draw%20Game%20Regulations.pdf |website=New York State Gaming Commission |publisher=New York State Gaming Commission |accessdate=2015-08-02 |page=4 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824015916/http://www.gaming.ny.gov/pdf/Proposed%20rulemaking%20for%20Powerball%20Amendments%20and%20Amendments%20to%20Other%20Draw%20Game%20Regulations.pdf |archivedate=August 24, 2015 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellspacing=3\n|-\n!Matches\n!Prize{{efn|name=cal|California's prize amounts are always parimutuel because its [[California Penal Code|state penal code]] distinguishes between a \"lottery\" which cannot be broken and a \"banked game\" whose [[Breaking the bank|bank theoretically could be broken]].

Each annuity payment is 5% higher than in the previous year to adjust for inflation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.powerball.com/powerball/pb_howtoplay.asp |title=Powerball - How To Play |publisher=Powerball.com |accessdate=January 12, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115222858/http://www.powerball.com/powerball/pb_howtoplay.asp |archive-date=January 15, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe advertised estimated jackpot represents the total payments that would be paid to jackpot winner(s) should they accept the annuity option. This estimate is based on the funds accumulated in the jackpot pool rolled over from prior drawings, expected sales for the next drawing, and market interest rates for the securities that would be used to fund the annuity.<ref name=\"powerball.com\" /> The estimated jackpot usually is 32.5% of the (non-''Power Play'') revenue of each base ($1) play, submitted by game members to accumulate into a prize pool to fund the jackpot. If the jackpot is not won in a particular drawing, the prize pool carries over to the next drawing, accumulating until there is a jackpot winner. This prize pool is the cash that is paid to a jackpot winner if they choose cash. If the winner chooses the annuity, current market rates are used to calculate the graduated payment schedule and the initial installment is paid. The remaining funds in the prize pool are invested to generate the income required to fund the remaining installments. If there are multiple jackpot winners for a drawing, the jackpot prize pool is divided equally for all such plays.\n\nMUSL and its members accept all investment risk and are contractually obligated and liable to the winner to make all scheduled payments to annuity winners. If a jackpot ticket is not claimed, the funds in the prize pool are returned to members in proportion to the amount they contributed to the prize pool. The members have different rules regulating how unclaimed funds are used.<ref name=\"powerball.com\"/>\n\nWhen the Powerball jackpot is won, the next jackpot is guaranteed to be $40 million (annuity). If a jackpot is not won, the minimum rollover is $10 million. The cash in the jackpot pool is guaranteed to be the current value of the annuity. If revenue from ticket sales falls below expectations, game members must contribute additional funds to the jackpot pool to cover the shortage; the most likely scenario where this can occur is if the jackpot is won in consecutive drawings.\n\nBecause of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]] and resulting drop in ticket sales plus the falling interest rates on which annuity prizes were based, Powerball administrators reduced the minimum starting jackpot to $20 million, and the minimum increase to $2 million when the previous jackpot is not won.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Leggate |first1=Jim |title=Powerball cuts jackpot amounts amid coronavirus sales drop |url=https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/powerball-cuts-jackpot-amounts-amid-coronavirus-sales-drop |accessdate=13 April 2020 |publisher=Fox Business |date=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Claiming prizes ===\n\nA winning ticket must be claimed in the jurisdiction in which it was purchased, regardless of residence. The minimum age to play Powerball is 18, except in Nebraska (19), and Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana and Mississippi (21).\n\nGenerally, Powerball players do not have to choose cash or annuity unless they win a jackpot (then they usually have 60 days to choose). Exceptions include [[Florida]] and [[Missouri]]; the 60-day \"[[clock]]\" starts with the drawing, so a [[Progressive jackpot|jackpot]] winner who wishes to take the cash option needs to make immediate plans to claim their prize. [[New Jersey]] and [[Texas]] require the cash/annuity choice to be made when ''playing''; in New Jersey, an annuity ticket can be changed to cash after winning, while in Texas, the choice is binding. (When the cash option was introduced in 1997, all Powerball players had to make the choice when playing. This regulation was phased out by 1999.) All Powerball prizes must be claimed within a period ranging from 90 days to a year, depending on where the ticket was bought.\n\nPowerball winnings in [[California]] are subject to [[Income tax in the United States#Federal income tax rates for individuals|Federal income tax]] only. There is no state income tax in [[Florida]], [[South Dakota]], [[Texas]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Wyoming]], and only on interest and dividends in [[Tennessee]] and [[New Hampshire]]. Winnings from tickets purchased outside of one's home state may be subject to the income tax laws of ''both'' states (with possible credit based on the two jurisdictions.)\n\n=== Secondary prizes ===\nUnlike the jackpot pool, other prizes are the responsibility and liability of each participating lottery. All revenue for Powerball ticket sales not used for jackpots is retained by each member; none of this revenue is shared with other lotteries. Members are liable only for the payment of secondary prizes sold there.\n\nSince the secondary prizes are defined in fixed amounts (except in California), if the liability for a given prize level exceed the funds in the prize pool for that level the amount of the prize may be reduced and the prize pool be distributed on a parimutuel basis and result in a prize lower than the fixed amounts given in the prize tables.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://floridalottery.com/powerball |title=Powerball |publisher=Floridalottery.com |date=January 18, 2016 |accessdate=January 16, 2016}}</ref> Because the secondary prize pools are calculated independently, it is possible lower-tier prizes will differ among the game members.\n\n=== Notable wins ===\n{{Main article|Lottery jackpot records#United States}}\nBecause the quoted jackpot amount is an annuity of 30 graduated annual payments, its cash value relative to the annuity fluctuates. The actual ratio depends on projected interest rates and other factors. MUSL starts with the cash value, built from a percentage of sales, and then calculates the advertised jackpot amount from that value, based on the average costs of the three best securities bids.<ref>[http://www.powerball.com/pb_contact.asp \"Why Has the Cash Jackpot Gone Down?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806042548/http://www.powerball.com/pb_contact.asp |date=August 6, 2015 }} Powerball Frequently Asked Questions.</ref>\n\nOn March 27, 2019, a single ticket purchased in [[Wisconsin]] was the only winner of a $768.4 million ($477 million cash) Powerball jackpot, the third largest in U.S. lottery history.

It is coordinated by the [[Multi-State Lottery Association]] (MUSL), a [[nonprofit organization]] formed by an agreement with US lotteries. Powerball's minimum advertised jackpot is $40 million (annuity); Powerball's annuity is paid in 30 [[graduated payments|graduated installments]] or winners may choose a lump sum payment instead. One lump sum payment will be less than the total of the 30 annual payments because of the [[time value of money]] and also because one check for a much larger sum will be taxed at a greater rate than 30 checks each at a much lower sum will be taxed.\n\nDrawings for Powerball are held every Wednesday and Saturday evening at 10:59 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]. Since October 7, 2015, the game has used a 5/69 (white balls) + 1/26 (Powerballs) matrix from which winning numbers are chosen, resulting in odds of 1 in 292,201,338 of winning a jackpot per play.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/01/13/how-powerball-manipulated-the-odds-to-make-a-1-5-billion-jackpot-happen |title=How Powerball manipulated the odds to create a $1.5864 billion jackpot |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=January 13, 2016}}</ref> Each play costs $2 or $3 with the ''Power Play'' option.

The game, and name, were changed to Powerball on April 19, 1992; its first drawing was held April 22.\n\n===Powerball begins===\nWhen it was launched in 1992 Powerball became the first game to use two drums. Using two drums to draw numbers from offers more manipulation by simultaneously allowing high jackpot odds, numerous prize levels and low overall odds of winning (as explained later, a ticket can win by matching only one number). The two-drum concept was suggested by Steve Caputo of the Oregon Lottery. The two-drum concept has since been used by ''The Big Game'' (now [[Mega Millions]]) in the US, [[Powerball (Australia)|Australia's Powerball]], [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|Thunderball]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Eurojackpot]] and [[EuroMillions]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThrough 2008, Powerball drawings usually were held at Screenscape Studios in [[West Des Moines, Iowa]]. The drawings' host was longtime Iowa radio personality Mike Pace, who had hosted MUSL drawings since Lotto America began in 1988. In 1996, Powerball went \"on the road\" for the first time, holding five remote drawings at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in Atlanta. A few weeks later, Georgia became the only jurisdiction to leave Powerball (Maine, which joined MUSL in 1990, left when Powerball began). In August 1996, Georgia joined the then-new ''The Big Game'', then the other major U.S. lottery group. It planned to sell tickets for ''both'' games for the rest of 1996; but within days Georgia was removed from MUSL, not to return until the 2010 cross-sell expansion.\n\nOn November 2, 1997, the [[Annuity (American)|annuity]] was changed from 20 to 25 yearly payments; the cash option was added.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://powerball.com/pb_history.asp |title=History |publisher=Powerball |accessdate=April 14, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201013549/http://powerball.com/pb_history.asp |archive-date=2018-02-01 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The annuity comprises 30 graduated payments, increasing 5% annually.\n\nIn 1998, [[Florida Lottery|Florida]] was given permission by its government to participate in a multi-state game. It was set to offer Powerball; but in early 1999, new governor [[Jeb Bush]] prevented Florida from joining since he believed Powerball would hurt the existing Florida Lottery games. In 2008, Governor [[Charlie Crist]] finally allowed Florida to join MUSL, on Jan 4, 2009.\n\nOn March 7, 2001, an optional multiplier (called ''Power Play'') was added, allowing players to multiply non-jackpot winnings by up to five by paying an extra $1 per game. A wheel was introduced to select the ''Power Play'' multiplier for each drawing (the next year, the ''1x'' was removed from the ''Power Play'' wheel.)\n\n===2009: Florida became host to drawings===\nWith the start of Powerball sales in Florida on January 4, 2009 (with its first drawing on January 7), the matrices changed to 5/59 + 1/39 (adding four white ball numbers and dropping three red balls). This changed the jackpot probability from 1:146 million to 1:195 million; the overall probability became 1:35.\n\nBased on statistical projections, the average jackpot win increased from $95 million to $141 million. Over 3.5 million additional prizes were expected to be won yearly due to the change in probability. The starting jackpot increased to $20 million, with minimum rollovers of $5 million. The jackpot contribution increased from 30.3% to 32.5% of total sales. The Power Play option was modified; second prize, usually $200,000, was given an automatic 5x multiplier, making the 5+0 prize $1 million cash. The bonus second prize if the jackpot exceeded its previous record by $25 million, triggered only twice, was eliminated with the 2012 format change.\n\nThe conditions for Florida joining Powerball included a move of the live drawings from Iowa to [[Universal Studios Florida|Universal Studios]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} The three hosts rotating announcing duties from Universal Studios were Tracy Wiu, Elizabeth Hart and Scott Adams (MUSL headquarters remained in Iowa, where its other draws are held). The wheel that was used to determine the Power Play multiplier was retired when the drawings moved to Florida; a [[Random number generation|random number generator]] (RNG) was used until the 2012 format change.\n\n[[Arkansas Scholarship Lottery|Arkansas]] became the 33rd MUSL member on October 31, 2009,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arkansasmatters.com/content/news/Lottery_Fulltext?cid=258812 |accessdate=2016-02-09 |df=mdy-all }}{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> the last to join before the 2010 cross-sell expansion.

Shortly after, discussions were revealed about allowing each US lottery to offer both games. On October 13, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL reached an agreement in principle to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://megamillions.com/mcenter/pressrelease.asp?newsID=D0CC83C2-97D5-4E0F-9FD4-E6945DCB0B98 |title=Mega Millions Official Home |publisher=Megamillions.com |date=October 13, 2009 |accessdate=April 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714070121/http://megamillions.com/mcenter/pressrelease.asp?newsID=D0CC83C2-97D5-4E0F-9FD4-E6945DCB0B98 |archivedate=July 14, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> In November, MUSL signed an agreement to start streaming Powerball drawings online.<ref>[http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=137273 \"Powerball Lottery Drawings to Be Available Live on the Internet\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101103/http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=137273 |date=March 4, 2016 }}, TransWorldNews, November 9, 2009.

Both games' drawings were simulcast via [[Chicago]] cable [[superstation]] [[WGN-TV]] through its national [[WGN America]] feed. WGN-TV aired Illinois Lottery drawings nationally from 1992 to 2015 after acquiring broadcast rights from Chicago's Fox [[owned-and-operated station]] [[WFLD]] in 1988, which took the rights from WGN-TV in 1987. Powerball drawings were aired on WGN-TV and WGN America on Wednesday and Saturday immediately following the station's 9:00 p.m. ([[Central Time Zone|Central Time]]) newscast with the Mega Millions drawings being aired Tue and Fri evenings after the newscast. WGN served as a default carrier of Mega Millions or Powerball where no local television station carries either multi-jurisdictional lottery's drawings.\n\nOn March 13, 2010, New Jersey became the first previous Mega Millions-only member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Powerball ticket. It was worth over $211 million in annuity payments; it was sold in [[Morris Plains, New Jersey|Morris Plains]]. On May 28, 2010, North Carolina became the first previous MUSL member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Mega Millions ticket; that jackpot was $12 million (annuity).\n\nOn June 2, 2010, Ohio won a Powerball jackpot; it became the first lottery selling ''either'' Mega Millions ''or'' Powerball (when 2010 began) to provide a jackpot-winning ticket for its newer game. The ticket was worth a $261 million annuity; it was sold in [[Sunbury, Ohio|Sunbury]]. Ohio's second Powerball jackpot-winning ticket, sold for the June 23, 2010 drawing, was part of another first; since Montana also provided a jackpot winner for that drawing, it was the first time a jackpot was shared through lotteries which sold competing games before the cross-selling expansion, as Montana sold only Powerball before the expansion date.\n\n===2012 format change===\nOn January 15, 2012, the price of each basic Powerball play doubled to $2, while PowerPlay games became $3; the minimum jackpot doubled to $40 million.<ref name=\"worldlottery\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldlottery.net/news/powerball-lottery-changes-2012.asp|title=Powerball Lottery Changes for 2012|author=Lotto, Lucy|date=June 30, 2011|publisher=WorldLottery.net|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823062810/http://www.worldlottery.net/news/powerball-lottery-changes-2012.asp|archivedate=August 23, 2013|url-status=dead|accessdate=September 4, 2013|quote=The first and biggest change to the Powerball Lottery is the introduction of the $40 million base jackpot.

This response is regarding the Corona Virus issue. <ref>{{cite web |title=POWERBALL 2020 changes |url=https://www.powerball.com/notice |website=Important Notice |accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> Since there was a Powerball Jackpot winner that matched all 5 numbers 48, 54, 39, 2, 37 and the Powerball Number 5 in New Jersey on Wednesday April 8, 2020, then this game had to reset to $20 million dollars!\n\n==Playing the game==\n===Basic game===\nThe minimum Powerball bet is $2. In each game, players select five numbers from a set of 69 white balls and one number from 26 red Powerballs; the red ball number can be the same as one of the white balls. The drawing order of the five white balls is irrelevant; all tickets show the white ball numbers in ascending order. Players cannot use the drawn Powerball to match two of their white numbers, or vice versa. Players can select their own numbers, or have the terminal [[Pseudorandomness|pseudorandomly]] select the numbers (called \"quick pick\", \"easy pick\", etc.).\n\nIn each drawing, winning numbers are selected using two ball machines: one containing the white balls and the other containing the red Powerballs. Five white balls are drawn from the first machine and the red ball from the second machine. Games matching at least three white balls or the red Powerball win.\n\nTwo identical machines are used for each drawing, randomly selected from four sets. The model of machine used is the Halogen, manufactured by Smartplay International of [[Edgewater Park, New Jersey]]. There are eight ball sets (four of each color); one set of each color is randomly selected before a drawing. The balls are mixed by a turntable at the bottom of the machine that propels the balls around the chamber. When the machine selects a ball, the turntable slows to catch it, sends it up the shaft, and then down the rail to the display. (The Florida Lottery is considering switching to a [[random number generator]] in 2019 for its in-state drawings; it is unknown whether Powerball would be affected.) If the onsite location is unavailable, as was the case during [[Hurricane Michael]], a backup machine is located at MUSL headquarters in Iowa.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/10/10/hurricane-michael-ran-million-powerball-drawing-out-town</ref>\n\nThe double matrices and probabilities in the game's history:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Starting date\n!Pick 5 White Balls from Field of\n!Pick 1 Red Ball from Field of\n!Jackpot chance\n!''Power Play'' multiplier\n|-\n|April 22, 1992\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|45\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|45\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:54,979,154\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\u2020\n|-\n|November 5, 1997\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|49\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:80,089,127\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\u2020\n|-\n|March 7, 2001\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|49\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:80,089,127\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1x-5x\n|-\n|October 9, 2002\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|53\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:120,526,769\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|August 28, 2005\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|55\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:146,107,961\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|January 7, 2009\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|39\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:195,249,054\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|January 15, 2012\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|35\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:175,223,510\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\n|-\n|January 19, 2014\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|35\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:175,223,510\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|October 7, 2015 <ref name=\"cnbc2015\">[https://nddb.coop/ccnddb/1024 Odds are, you won't like this Powerball story]{{Retrieved | accessdate=2015-07-09}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|69\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|26\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:292,201,338\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x; 10x\u2021\n|}\n\n\u2020''Power Play'' was introduced in 2001.<br />\n\u202110\u00d7 available if jackpot is under $150 million.<ref name=LotteryWorld2015/>\n\nWhile Mega Millions and Powerball each have similar jackpot odds despite having a different double matrix (Mega Millions is 5/75&nbsp;+&nbsp;1/15), since Powerball is $2 per play, it now takes $584,402,676 (not counting Power Play side bets) on average to produce a jackpot-winning ticket.\n\n===Power Play===\nFor an additional $1 per game, a player may activate the Power Play option. Activating it multiplies lower-tier winnings (base prize $50,000 or less) by up to 5, or 10 when the jackpot is under $150 million. Power Play is drawn separately from the 6 numbers. The 5+0 prize is automatically doubled to $2 million if Power Play is activated.\n\nThe dilemma for players is whether to maximize the chance at the jackpot or increase lower-tier winnings. If a player selects a fixed amount of money to spend on tickets at a certain time, the player will give up one guess of the winning set of numbers every two times this player activates Power Play in respect of one of the purchased tickets.\n\nPower Play, when it began in 2001, was drawn with a special wheel. In 2006 and 2007, MUSL replaced one of the 5\u00d7 spaces on the Power Play wheel with a 10\u00d7. During each month-long promotion, MUSL guaranteed that there would be at least one drawing with a 10\u00d7 multiplier. The promotion returned in 2008; the ball landed in the 10\u00d7 space twice. After being absent in 2009, the 10\u00d7 multiplier returned in May 2010 (after the Power Play drawing was changed to RNG.) The promotion was extended for the only time, as the 10\u00d7 multiplier was not drawn until June 12, 2010. The second prize 5\u00d7 guarantee continued; the 10\u00d7 applied to all non-jackpot prizes, as in previous promotions.\n\nPower Play's success has led to similar multipliers in other games, most notably ''Megaplier'', available through all [[Mega Millions]] members except California. The 2012 Powerball changes resulted in all eight lower-tier levels having \"fixed\" Power Play prizes.<ref name=\"Changes Coming to Powerball\">{{cite web |url=http://www.powerball.com/pb_message.asp |title=Changes Coming to Powerball... |publisher=Multi-State Lottery Association |accessdate=January 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123094841/http://www.powerball.com/pb_message.asp |archivedate=January 23, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nOn January 19, 2014, PowerPlay was modified; it used 30 balls with the following distribution:\n*2x (15)\n*3x (9)\n*4x/5x: 3 each\n\nOn October 4, 2015, PowerPlay changed again, using 42 or 43\u2020 balls as follows:\n*2x (24)\n*3x (13)\n*4x (3)\n*5x (2)\n*10x (1)\u2020\n\n\u2020 10x available when jackpot is under $150 million.\n\n===Prizes and odds===\n\nPayouts as of October 7, 2015:<ref>{{cite web |title=NEW YORK STATE GAMING COMMISSION AMENDMENT OF SECTIONS 5004.9, 5007.2, 5007.13, 5007.15, 5007.16, 5009.2 and 5010.2 OF NEW YORK CODES, RULES AND REGULATIONS TITLE 9, SUBTITLE T, CHAPTER III, SUBCHAPTER A |url=http://www.gaming.ny.gov/pdf/Proposed%20rulemaking%20for%20Powerball%20Amendments%20and%20Amendments%20to%20Other%20Draw%20Game%20Regulations.pdf |website=New York State Gaming Commission |publisher=New York State Gaming Commission |accessdate=2015-08-02 |page=4 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824015916/http://www.gaming.ny.gov/pdf/Proposed%20rulemaking%20for%20Powerball%20Amendments%20and%20Amendments%20to%20Other%20Draw%20Game%20Regulations.pdf |archivedate=August 24, 2015 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellspacing=3\n|-\n!Matches\n!Prize{{efn|name=cal|California's prize amounts are always parimutuel because its [[California Penal Code|state penal code]] distinguishes between a \"lottery\" which cannot be broken and a \"banked game\" whose [[Breaking the bank|bank theoretically could be broken]].

This estimate is based on the funds accumulated in the jackpot pool rolled over from prior drawings, expected sales for the next drawing, and market interest rates for the securities that would be used to fund the annuity.<ref name=\"powerball.com\" /> The estimated jackpot usually is 32.5% of the (non-''Power Play'') revenue of each base ($1) play, submitted by game members to accumulate into a prize pool to fund the jackpot. If the jackpot is not won in a particular drawing, the prize pool carries over to the next drawing, accumulating until there is a jackpot winner. This prize pool is the cash that is paid to a jackpot winner if they choose cash. If the winner chooses the annuity, current market rates are used to calculate the graduated payment schedule and the initial installment is paid. The remaining funds in the prize pool are invested to generate the income required to fund the remaining installments. If there are multiple jackpot winners for a drawing, the jackpot prize pool is divided equally for all such plays.\n\nMUSL and its members accept all investment risk and are contractually obligated and liable to the winner to make all scheduled payments to annuity winners. If a jackpot ticket is not claimed, the funds in the prize pool are returned to members in proportion to the amount they contributed to the prize pool. The members have different rules regulating how unclaimed funds are used.<ref name=\"powerball.com\"/>\n\nWhen the Powerball jackpot is won, the next jackpot is guaranteed to be $40 million (annuity). If a jackpot is not won, the minimum rollover is $10 million. The cash in the jackpot pool is guaranteed to be the current value of the annuity. If revenue from ticket sales falls below expectations, game members must contribute additional funds to the jackpot pool to cover the shortage; the most likely scenario where this can occur is if the jackpot is won in consecutive drawings.\n\nBecause of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]] and resulting drop in ticket sales plus the falling interest rates on which annuity prizes were based, Powerball administrators reduced the minimum starting jackpot to $20 million, and the minimum increase to $2 million when the previous jackpot is not won.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Leggate |first1=Jim |title=Powerball cuts jackpot amounts amid coronavirus sales drop |url=https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/powerball-cuts-jackpot-amounts-amid-coronavirus-sales-drop |accessdate=13 April 2020 |publisher=Fox Business |date=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Claiming prizes ===\n\nA winning ticket must be claimed in the jurisdiction in which it was purchased, regardless of residence. The minimum age to play Powerball is 18, except in Nebraska (19), and Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana and Mississippi (21).\n\nGenerally, Powerball players do not have to choose cash or annuity unless they win a jackpot (then they usually have 60 days to choose). Exceptions include [[Florida]] and [[Missouri]]; the 60-day \"[[clock]]\" starts with the drawing, so a [[Progressive jackpot|jackpot]] winner who wishes to take the cash option needs to make immediate plans to claim their prize. [[New Jersey]] and [[Texas]] require the cash/annuity choice to be made when ''playing''; in New Jersey, an annuity ticket can be changed to cash after winning, while in Texas, the choice is binding. (When the cash option was introduced in 1997, all Powerball players had to make the choice when playing. This regulation was phased out by 1999.) All Powerball prizes must be claimed within a period ranging from 90 days to a year, depending on where the ticket was bought.\n\nPowerball winnings in [[California]] are subject to [[Income tax in the United States#Federal income tax rates for individuals|Federal income tax]] only. There is no state income tax in [[Florida]], [[South Dakota]], [[Texas]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Wyoming]], and only on interest and dividends in [[Tennessee]] and [[New Hampshire]]. Winnings from tickets purchased outside of one's home state may be subject to the income tax laws of ''both'' states (with possible credit based on the two jurisdictions.)\n\n===Secondary prizes===\nUnlike the jackpot pool, other prizes are the responsibility and liability of each participating lottery. All revenue for Powerball ticket sales not used for jackpots is retained by each member; none of this revenue is shared with other lotteries. Members are liable only for the payment of secondary prizes sold there.\n\nSince the secondary prizes are defined in fixed amounts (except in California), if the liability for a given prize level exceed the funds in the prize pool for that level the amount of the prize may be reduced and the prize pool be distributed on a parimutuel basis and result in a prize lower than the fixed amounts given in the prize tables.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://floridalottery.com/powerball |title=Powerball |publisher=Floridalottery.com |date=January 18, 2016 |accessdate=January 16, 2016}}</ref> Because the secondary prize pools are calculated independently, it is possible lower-tier prizes will differ among the game members.\n\n==Notable wins==\n{{Main article|Lottery jackpot records#United States}}\nBecause the quoted jackpot amount is an annuity of 30 graduated annual payments, its cash value relative to the annuity fluctuates. The actual ratio depends on projected interest rates and other factors. MUSL starts with the cash value, built from a percentage of sales, and then calculates the advertised jackpot amount from that value, based on the average costs of the three best securities bids.<ref>[http://www.powerball.com/pb_contact.asp \"Why Has the Cash Jackpot Gone Down?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806042548/http://www.powerball.com/pb_contact.asp |date=August 6, 2015 }} Powerball Frequently Asked Questions.</ref>\n\nOn March 27, 2019, a single ticket purchased in [[Wisconsin]] was the only winner of a $768.4 million ($477 million cash) Powerball jackpot, the third largest in U.S. lottery history.

Throughout much of the 19th century, it was listed among the top 10 U.S. cities by population, surpassed only by [[New Orleans]] and the older, established settlements of the United States eastern seaboard, as well as being the [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade#1840|sixth-biggest city]] for a period spanning 1840 until 1860. Cincinnati was the first city founded after the [[American Revolution]], as well as the first major inland city in the country.\n\nCincinnati developed with fewer immigrants and less influence from Europe than East Coast cities in the same period. However, it received a significant number of German-speaking immigrants, who founded many of the city's cultural institutions.  By the end of the 19th century, with the shift from steamboats to railroads drawing off freight shipping, trade patterns had altered and Cincinnati's growth slowed considerably.

Prior to 1924, City council members were elected through a system of [[Ward (politics)|wards]].  The ward system was subject to corruption due to partisan rule. From the 1880s to the 1920s, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] dominated city politics, with the [[political machine]] of  George B. [[George B. Cox|\"Boss\" Cox]] exerting control.\n\nA reform movement arose in 1923, led by another Republican, [[Murray Seasongood]]. Seasongood founded the Charter Committee, which used ballot initiatives in 1924 to replace the ward system with the current at-large system. They gained approval by voters for a [[council\u2013manager government]] form of government, in which the smaller council (compared to the number of previous ward representatives) hires a professional manager to operate daily affairs of the city.  From 1924 to 1957, the council was elected by [[proportional representation]] and single transfer voting (STV). Starting with Ashtabula in 1915, several major cities in Ohio adopted this electoral system, which had the practical effect of reducing ward boss and political party power. For that reason, such groups opposed it.\n\nIn an effort to overturn the charter that provided for proportional representation, opponents in 1957 fanned fears of black political power, at a time of increasing civil rights activism.<ref name=\"amy\">[https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/articles/Brief%20History%20of%20PR.htm Douglas J.

The downturn in industry in the late 20th century caused a loss of many jobs, leaving many people in poverty.

Throughout much of the 19th century, it was listed among the top 10 U.S. cities by population, surpassed only by [[New Orleans]] and the older, established settlements of the United States eastern seaboard, as well as being the [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade#1840|sixth-biggest city]] for a period spanning 1840 until 1860. Cincinnati was the first city founded after the [[American Revolution]], as well as the first major inland city in the country.\n\nCincinnati developed with fewer immigrants and less influence from Europe than East Coast cities in the same period. However, it received a significant number of German-speaking immigrants, who founded many of the city's cultural institutions.  By the end of the 19th century, with the shift from steamboats to railroads drawing off freight shipping, trade patterns had altered and Cincinnati's growth slowed considerably. The city was surpassed in population by other inland cities, particularly [[Chicago]], which developed based on strong commodity exploitation, economics, and the railroads, and [[St. Louis]], which for decades after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] served as the gateway to westward migration.\n\nCincinnati is home to three major sports teams: the [[Cincinnati Reds]] of [[Major League Baseball]]; the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] of the [[National Football League]]; and  [[FC Cincinnati]] of [[Major League Soccer]].

Prior to 1924, City council members were elected through a system of [[Ward (politics)|wards]].  The ward system was subject to corruption due to partisan rule. From the 1880s to the 1920s, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] dominated city politics, with the [[political machine]] of  George B. [[George B. Cox|\"Boss\" Cox]] exerting control.\n\nA reform movement arose in 1923, led by another Republican, [[Murray Seasongood]]. Seasongood founded the Charter Committee, which used ballot initiatives in 1924 to replace the ward system with the current at-large system. They gained approval by voters for a [[council\u2013manager government]] form of government, in which the smaller council (compared to the number of previous ward representatives) hires a professional manager to operate daily affairs of the city.  From 1924 to 1957, the council was elected by [[proportional representation]] and single transfer voting (STV). Starting with Ashtabula in 1915, several major cities in Ohio adopted this electoral system, which had the practical effect of reducing ward boss and political party power. For that reason, such groups opposed it.\n\nIn an effort to overturn the charter that provided for proportional representation, opponents in 1957 fanned fears of black political power, at a time of increasing civil rights activism.<ref name=\"amy\">[https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/articles/Brief%20History%20of%20PR.htm Douglas J.

Changing his mind at the last minute, he recalls his days in elementary school and the events that have led him here. A new student named Shoko Nishimiya informs the class that she is deaf. She tries to integrate with the class but ends up annoying Shoya and his friends, so they start to bully her. When word of the bullying reaches the principal, Shoya is singled out as the culprit. Soon, the class's bullying is directed toward him, subjecting him to the same treatment he gave Shoko. Shoya blames Shoko, and the two get into a physical altercation. She is subsequently transferred to another school. He later finds Shoko's notebook, which she left behind, and keeps it.\n\nNow in high school, Shoya is a social reject. He blocks out the faces of those around him, unable to look them in the eye. Tomohiro Nagatsuka, another loner, befriends Shoya after Shoya helps him with a bully. Shoya visits the [[sign language]] center, returns Shoko's notebook to her in the hopes of making amends and reveals he has learned [[Japanese Sign Language|sign language]]. The two begin meeting at a bridge to feed bread to Koi fish.\n\nOne day, Shoya and Shoko accidentally drop Shoko's notebook into a river, and they jump in to retrieve it, which is prohibited. Yuzuru Nishimiya, Shoko's younger sister, secretly takes a photo of Shoya jumping in and posts it online. Shoya is suspended.\n\nShoya finds Yuzuru, who ran away from home, and brings her to stay at his house. When she leaves in the middle of the night, Shoya follows and tells her that he is remorseful for the way he treated Shoko; she decides to go home. The sisters' mother, Yaeko Nishimiya, slaps Shoya in the face before bringing Yuzuru inside.\n\nShoya and Shoko reunite with Miyoko Sahara, a classmate from elementary school who was friendly to Shoko. Shoko gives Shoya a gift and confesses her feelings for him, but because she tries to speak her affections rather than signing them out, Shoya does not understand her.\n\nShoya invites her to an amusement park with Tomohiro, Miyoko, Miki Kawai (another classmate from elementary school) and Satoshi Mashiba (Miki's friend). There, they meet another classmate from elementary school, Naoka Ueno, who drags Shoko into a ferris wheel. Naoka voices her feelings of hatred for Shoko, whom Naoka blames for creating a rift between her and Shoya. At school, desperate to remain blameless for her part in bullying Shoko, Miki exposes Shoya's past to the students who were oblivious to it. Later, the group has a heated confrontation.\n\nShoya goes back to the bridge to meet Shoko but ends up seeing Yuzuru, whose grandmother had just died recently. To cheer Shoko up, Shoya takes her to the countryside, where he begins to understand how much she blames herself for everything that has happened to him. Desperate to change her mindset, Shoya contrives to regularly meet with the sisters.\n\nDuring the [[Fireworks#Japan|fireworks festival]], Shoko goes home under the guise of finishing some schoolwork. Shoya follows when Yuzuru asks him to get her camera. When he arrives, he finds Shoko standing on the balcony, about to commit suicide. Shoya succeeds in grabbing her and pulls her back up, but he falls into the river below. He is rescued but slips into a coma.\n\nOne night, Shoko dreams about receiving a farewell visit from Shoya. Horrified, she runs to the bridge and collapses in tears. Shoya, awakening from his coma, stumbles to the bridge and finds her there. He apologizes for the way he treated her. He asks her to stop blaming herself and admits that, while he once considered ending his own life, he has since decided against it. Shoya then asks her to help him continue to live.\n\nWhen Shoya goes to the [[Cultural festival (Japan)|school festival]] with Shoko, he finds out how much his new friends still care for him, and they reconcile. During the festival, Shoya is finally able to look at other people's faces again and looks around at his family and all the new friends he has made.

Please check the word count before making any additions. Please go to the talk page before making any major changes. -->\nJapanese teenager Shoya Ishida intends to commit suicide. Changing his mind at the last minute, he recalls his days in elementary school and the events that have led him here. A new student named Shoko Nishimiya informs the class that she is deaf. She tries to integrate with the class but ends up annoying Shoya and his friends, so they start to bully her. When word of the bullying reaches the principal, Shoya is singled out as the culprit. Soon, the class's bullying is directed toward him, subjecting him to the same treatment he gave Shoko. Shoya blames Shoko, and the two get into a physical altercation. She is subsequently transferred to another school. He later finds Shoko's notebook, which she left behind, and keeps it.\n\nNow in high school, Shoya is a social reject. He blocks out the faces of those around him, unable to look them in the eye. Tomohiro Nagatsuka, another loner, befriends Shoya after Shoya helps him with a bully. Shoya visits the [[sign language]] center, returns Shoko's notebook to her in the hopes of making amends and reveals he has learned [[Japanese Sign Language|sign language]]. The two begin meeting at a bridge to feed bread to Koi fish.\n\nOne day, Shoya and Shoko accidentally drop Shoko's notebook into a river, and they jump in to retrieve it, which is prohibited. Yuzuru Nishimiya, Shoko's younger sister, secretly takes a photo of Shoya jumping in and posts it online. Shoya is suspended.\n\nShoya finds Yuzuru, who ran away from home, and brings her to stay at his house. When she leaves in the middle of the night, Shoya follows and tells her that he is remorseful for the way he treated Shoko; she decides to go home. The sisters' mother, Yaeko Nishimiya, slaps Shoya in the face before bringing Yuzuru inside.\n\nShoya and Shoko reunite with Miyoko Sahara, a classmate from elementary school who was friendly to Shoko. Shoko gives Shoya a gift and confesses her feelings for him, but because she tries to speak her affections rather than signing them out, Shoya does not understand her.\n\nShoya invites her to an amusement park with Tomohiro, Miyoko, Miki Kawai (another classmate from elementary school) and Satoshi Mashiba (Miki's friend). There, they meet another classmate from elementary school, Naoka Ueno, who drags Shoko into a ferris wheel. Naoka voices her feelings of hatred for Shoko, whom Naoka blames for creating a rift between her and Shoya. At school, desperate to remain blameless for her part in bullying Shoko, Miki exposes Shoya's past to the students who were oblivious to it. Later, the group has a heated confrontation.\n\nShoya goes back to the bridge to meet Shoko but ends up seeing Yuzuru, whose grandmother had just died recently. To cheer Shoko up, Shoya takes her to the countryside, where he begins to understand how much she blames herself for everything that has happened to him. Desperate to change her mindset, Shoya contrives to regularly meet with the sisters.\n\nDuring the [[Fireworks#Japan|fireworks festival]], Shoko goes home under the guise of finishing some schoolwork. Shoya follows when Yuzuru asks him to get her camera. When he arrives, he finds Shoko standing on the balcony, about to commit suicide. Shoya succeeds in grabbing her and pulls her back up, but he falls into the river below. He is rescued but slips into a coma.\n\nOne night, Shoko dreams about receiving a farewell visit from Shoya. Horrified, she runs to the bridge and collapses in tears. Shoya, awakening from his coma, stumbles to the bridge and finds her there. He apologizes for the way he treated her. He asks her to stop blaming herself and admits that, while he once considered ending his own life, he has since decided against it. Shoya then asks her to help him continue to live.\n\nWhen Shoya goes to the [[Cultural festival (Japan)|school festival]] with Shoko, he finds out how much his new friends still care for him, and they reconcile. During the festival, Shoya is finally able to look at other people's faces again and looks around at his family and all the new friends he has made. He cries, realizing he has finally obtained redemption and has found forgiveness at last.\n\n==Voice cast==\n;{{nihongo|Shoya Ishida|\u77f3\u7530 \u5c06\u4e5f|Ishida Sh\u014dya}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Miyu Irino]],<ref name=\"VAPart1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-05-27/a-silent-voice-anime-film-stars-miyu-irino-saori-hayami/.102548|title=A Silent Voice Anime Film Stars Miyu Irino, Saori Hayami|date=May 27, 2016|website=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=May 27, 2016}}</ref> [[Mayu Matsuoka]] (child)<ref name=\"VAPart2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-07-08/a-silent-voice-anime-film-reveals-trailer-more-cast-new-visual/.104076|title=A Silent Voice Anime Film Reveals Trailer, More Cast, New Visual|date=July 8, 2016|website=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=July 8, 2016}}</ref>|[[Robbie Daymond]],<ref name=\"English Cast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.blog.alltheanime.com/a-silent-voice-uk-home-video-release-details/|title='A Silent Voice' UK Home Video Details|date=September 26, 2017|publisher=All The Anime|accessdate=September 26, 2017}}</ref> Ryan Shanahan (child)}}\n:A high school boy who bullied Shoko Nishimiya, a deaf girl, in elementary school.

The complex movements of the legs and body pose were done entirely through hydraulics. The hydraulic fluid and pressure was supplied through an off-board system.

{"title_page": "Carl E. Duckett", "text_new": "{{peacock|date=November 2010}}\n'''Carl Ernest Duckett''' (22 March 1923 \u2013 1 April 1992) was the founder of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s science and technology operations.<ref>\"Carl E. Duckett\" in Agenda for Central Intelligence Agency'a 50th Anniversary Trailblazer Awards Ceremony, Sept. 18, 1997</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\nCarl Duckett was born and raised in [[Swannanoa, North Carolina]], an unincorporated community a few miles east of [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]]. He attended the [[Buncombe County, North Carolina|Buncombe County]] schools in Swannanoa, graduating from high school in 1940. His father was a construction laborer at the Beacon Blanket Manufacturing Company, the epicenter of the Swannanoa community, and he wanted his son to start a career at the mill. Carl\u2019s ambition, however, was to work in [[radio broadcasting]], and he left Swannanoa to search for work in this field.<ref>Much of the general information on Duckett\u2019s background prior to mid-1963 came from ''Carl Ernest Duckett, Personal History Statement; Form 444, Central Intelligence Agency, 21 August 1963'', the narrative provided with his application to join the Central Intelligence Agency.</ref>\n\nWith a good speaking voice, some musical talent, and a very persuasive nature, Duckett eventually found beginner employment at [[WMVA]], a small station being established in [[Martinsville, Virginia]]. While there, he married Nannie Jane Law in 1941, and started a family.<ref>From interview with family member.</ref> He also gained an elementary knowledge of [[radio electronics]], and, to prepare for a better job, attended part-time for six months a course in this field at the nearby [[Danville Community College|Danville Technical Institute]].\n\nIn early 1943, Duckett was employed as a [[technician]] by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. Apparently a fast learner, he was soon assigned to work on Army radars for [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] fire control. During this period, he also attended courses in radio engineering under the Government-sponsored [[Engineering, Science, and Management War Training]] (ESMWT) Program at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. In 1944, he was a member of a team sent to England to advise on the use of Westinghouse [[SCR-584 radar]] equipment for [[V-1 (flying bomb)|V-1 \u2018buzz bomb\u2019]] defense, and stayed as a field engineer during the [[Invasion of Normandy|Normandy invasion]].\n\nDrafted into the U.S. Army in October 1944, Duckett served in the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]] until July 1946. As a radar specialist, he rapidly advanced from [[Private (rank)|Private]] to [[Master Sergeant]], with assignments that included the [[Radiation Laboratory]] (Rad Lab) at MIT, the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater of Operations]], and the [[White Sands Missile Range|White Sands Proving Grounds]] (WSPG) in [[New Mexico]]. While at White Sands, he participated in the first launch in the U.S. of a captured German [[V-2]] rocket and gained knowledge of the [[telemetry]] equipment used in this testing.\n\nFollowing his discharge from the Army, Duckett returned to radio broadcasting in Martinsville. He also received a [[General radiotelephone operator license|First-Class Commercial Radiotelephone License]] from the [[Federal Communications Commission]], making him eligible for higher positions in this field, and joined in establishing radio station [[WCGX|WBOB]] in [[Galax, Virginia]]. After the station went on the air in April 1947, he was not only the chief engineer but also served as the station manager and an announcer/[[disk jockey]].<ref>Alicoate, John, (ed); \u201cWBOB; Galax, Virginia,\u201d ''1948 Radio Annual'', Radio Daily, 1948, p. 669</ref> Highly aggressive in these activities, he was one of the founders of a Virginia-wide association of news broadcasters (1949)<ref>\u201cRadio Stations Form Virginia Press Caster Organization,\u201d ''Billboard Magazine'', Mar. 5, 1949, p. 6</ref> and represented Virginia radio stations in a meeting with President [[Harry S. Truman]] (1950).<ref>\u201cHarry S. Truman, The President\u2019s Day:  Monday, June 12, 1950\u201d;  http://www.trumanlibrary.org/calendar/main.php?currYear=1950&currMonth=6&currDay=12</ref> He also promoted a [[bluegrass music]] group that made hit records and, later, performed before [[Elizabeth II]], the Queen of England.<ref>\u201cMaude & Toby Lowe\u201d; http://auntmarthasmusic.com/Musicmemories.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914180051/http://www.auntmarthasmusic.com/Musicmemories.html |date=2011-09-14 }}</ref>\n\n==Telemetry and intelligence==\n\nAt the end of World War II when Duckett was discharged from the Army, he had remained in the [[United States Army Reserve|Reserves]]. As the [[Korean War]] started, he was called back to active duty in October 1950, and soon received a [[Direct commission officer|direct commission]] as a [[Second Lieutenant]]. After completing the Signal Officer\u2019s School at [[Fort Monmouth, New Jersey]], he was again assigned to White Sands. There his progressive duties included Commander of a remotely located radar station, Chief of the Radar Instrumentation Division, and Project Manager of the first test-range microwave communication system. He was promoted to [[First Lieutenant]] and remained at White Sands until reverting to Retired Reserves status in June 1953. Three years later, he received the rank of [[Captain (land)|Captain]] in the Reserves.\n\nUpon leaving Army active duty, Duckett remained at White Sands as a [[Civil service|civil-service]] employee. During a three-year tenure at WSPG, he progressed from [[General Schedule]] (GS) Grade 12 to Grade 15 in positions that included Deputy Assistant for Engineering; Chief, Plans and Programs Office; and Scientific Advisor to the Signal Officer.\n\nThe team of German scientists and engineers under [[Wernher von Braun]], initially brought to the U.S. under [[Operation Paperclip]], had worked at [[Fort Bliss, Texas]], and tested their missiles at nearby WSPG. After being moved to [[Redstone Arsenal]], [[Huntsville, Alabama]], in 1950, they continued to use the ranges at White Sands. While in the Army and in civil service positions, Duckett worked closely with this team and others from Redstone Arsenal, and became intimately familiar with the telemetry systems that were originally developed in Germany at the [[Peenem\u00fcnde Army Research Center]], as well as the newer American derivative systems.\n\nActivities at Redstone Arsenal evolved from the small Ordnance Guided Missile Center in 1950, through the development of the [[PGM-11 Redstone|Redstone Rocket]], and the opening of the [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency]] (ABMA) in 1956. The ABMA was responsible for a wide variety of missiles, including [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter]], the Army\u2019s first [[medium-range ballistic missile]]. In July 1956, Duckett accepted a civil service position with the ABMA, joining the Guidance and Control Laboratory as a telemetry specialist and serving as a Scientific Advisor to the Commanding Officer, Major General [[John B. Medaris]].<ref>Personal interviews with several individuals who worked with or for Duckett at Redstone Arsenal.</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1950s, the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) set up a [[listening station]] near the coastal town of [[Sinop, Turkey]], directly across the [[Black Sea]] from the [[Kapustin Yar]] range, where the Soviets were testing medium-range missiles. In early 1957, it became known that the [[Soviet Union]] was testing an [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM) at their Tyuratam range and soon a listening station was opened by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) at [[Behshahr]] in northeast [[Iran]], some {{convert|1000|mi|km}} across the [[Caspian Sea]]. Tapes were made of signals obtained by these listening post, and an ''ad hoc'' activity called Jam Session was started by the CIA for their interpretation; Duckett was a Jam Session participant. They soon recognized that the Russians were using the same telemetry frequencies and formats originally developed by the Germans during World War II.<ref>''Opt. Cet.'', Redstone Arsenal Interviews</ref>\n\nOn October 4, 1957, America was shaken by the launch by the Soviet Union of the first artificial satellite, ''[[Sputnik I]]''. The U.S. Air Force and the CIA assembled a highly secret Telemetry and Beacon Analysis Committee (TABAC) to analyze the signals recorded from the launch at Tyuratam and those heard all over the world from ''Sputnik''. From his work in Jam Session, Duckett was asked to be a leader in the TABAC effort. It required about 18 months to calibrate the signals and understand how they related to the launch vehicle characteristics.<ref>Taubman, Philip; ''Secret Empire: Eisenhower, the CIA, and the Hidden Story of America\u2019s Space Espionage'', Simon & Schuster, 2003, p. 335</ref> The payoff, however, was significant; for the next two decades this provided the U.S a major window into the operation of Soviet missiles.<ref>''Opt. Cet.'', Redstone Arsenal Interviews</ref>\n\nIn mid-1958, the ABMA was absorbed into the newly formed Army Ordnance Missile Command (AOMC), headquartered on Redstone Arsenal. At that time, a small Signals Intelligence Group, led by Duckett, was established as a separate unit. In early 1961, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) formed the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA), integrating all of the defense intelligence in the DoD. The AOMC had the DoD\u2019s most extensive capability for analyzing missiles; thus, to support the DIA, in December the Missile Intelligence Office (MIO) was made an official organization on the AOMC Commanding General\u2019s Staff; Duckett was named Chief of the MIO.<ref>\u201cCarl E. Duckett Named Chief of Missile Intelligence Office,\u201d ''Redstone Rocket'', vol. X, no. 32 (Dec. 13), 1961, p. 2</ref>\n \nFrom the start, one of the most significant activities of the MIO was the analysis of public and clandestine photographs of Soviet missiles and their launch sites, and from these and telemetry signals, estimating the missile capabilities. Sometimes models of the pictured missiles were built and tested in the AOMC [[wind tunnel]]s for determining their [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] characteristics.<ref>''Opt. Cet.'', Redstone Arsenal Interviews</ref>\n\nStarting in mid-1956, the CIA began [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] aircraft flights over the [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR) and the [[People\u2019s Republic of China]] (PRC).  These carried cameras that provided pictures with a resolution of {{convert|2.5|ft|m}} from an altitude of {{convert|60000|ft|m}} and higher; they were of great value in identifying missiles being manufactured and on the launch sites. In mid-1959, the CIA initiated [[Corona (satellite)|CORONA]], the program name for a series of satellites with increasingly more accurate cameras. The exposed film was ejected in a capsule with a parachute and then caught in the air by aircraft. The first successful mission, designated Keyhole 1 (KH-1), took place in August 1960. Some 1,400 photos were taken, covering more of the Soviet Union than all of the prior U-2 overflights combined. The resolution, however, was nowhere close to that obtained from U-2 cameras.,<ref>Peebles, Curtis; ''The Corona Project: America\u2019s First Spy Satellites'', Naval Inst. Press, 1997</ref>\n\nIn August 1962, the AOMC was expanded to become the Army Missile Command (AMC) and the MIO became the Missile Intelligence Directorate (MID), with Duckett as the Director. Duckett and others from the MID participated in the CORONA photo interpretation. The Committee on Overhead Reconnaissance (COR) was formed by the CIA to select areas for imaging; Duckett was a COR member. As the [[Cold War]] between America and the Soviet Union intensified, the COR selected [[Cuba]] as an imaging target.\n\nThe [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] began in September 1962, when CORONA imagery indicated likely missile launch sites being surreptitiously built at several sites across the island. On October 14, to obtain clearer images, U-2 reconnaissance aircraft flew over the suspected areas, each flight obtaining about 4,000 pictures. A joint CIA and DoD activity called Photographic Interpretation Center (PGIC) was responsible for interpreting such data. Led by Duckett, a team of image interpreters from the MID assembled at the PGIC and quickly released its top secret report identifying the sites as those for Soviet [[R-12 Dvina|R-12 ''Dvina'']] (NATO designation SS-4 ''Sandal'') medium-range ballistic missiles, and Soviet [[R-14 Chusovaya|R-14 ''Chusovaya'']] (NATO designation SS-5 ''Skean'') [[intermediate-range ballistic missile]]s. President [[John F. Kennedy]] imposed a military blockade of Cuba, and the confrontation ended on October 28, 1962, when Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] agreed to dismantle the offensive missiles and return them to the USSR.<ref>Correll, John T.; \"Airpower and the Cuban Missile Crisis,\u201d ''Air Force Magazine'', vol. 88, no. 8 (August 2005). http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2005/August%202005/0805u2.aspx.</ref>\n\n==Central Intelligence Agency==\n\nThe Central Intelligence Agency was formed in July 1947, at the direction of President [[Harry S. Truman]]. The CIA would be headed by a [[Director of Central Intelligence]] (DCI), reporting directly to the President. From the start, and for several following years, it was not widely accepted that the CIA was responsible for producing scientific intelligence.\n\nThe great importance of science and technology in intelligence was clearly shown in the Cuban Missile Crisis. Thus, in August 1963, a number of technical operations in the three existing directorates of the CIA were consolidated to form the Deputy Directorate of Science and Technology (DDS&T) with [[Albert D. Wheelon]] as the leader. In November, a Foreign Missile and Space Analysis Center (FMSAC) was formed in the DDS&T. Having worked with him on Jam Session and TABAC, Wheelon was well aware of Duckett\u2019s capabilities, and enticed him to leave the MID in Huntsville and head the FMSAC.<ref>Richelson, Jeffrey T.; ''The Wizards of Langley: Inside the CIA\u2019s Directorate of Science and Technology\u2019\u2019, Westview Press, 2002, pp. 80-81</ref>\n\nDuring the next several years, Duckett and the FMSAC were kept busy with Soviet accomplishments: ''Cosmos'' reconnaissance and ''Molniya'' communication spacecraft; ''Voshkov'' and the first spacewalk and ''Venera'' missions past Venus in 1965; and the ''Luna'' soft landing on the moon and the transmission of surface images in 1966 that put the Soviets ahead in the moon race. Of perhaps greater concern were Soviet ballistic missiles: third-generation ICBMs (NATO designations [[R-36 (missile)|SS-9]], [[UR-100 (missile)|SS-11]], and [[SS-13 Savage|SS-13]]), as well as submarine-launched intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) that could easily reach U.S. territory.\n\nIn addition to telemetry, Duckett and the FMSAC analyzed radar, optical, and photographic information. For collection, the electronic intelligence receiving station in Iran continued, and other stations were established in [[Norway]] and on ships. A {{convert|150|ft|m|adj=on}} dish antenna at [[Stanford University]] was used to monitor Soviet radar signals after they bounced off the Moon. Chinese missile and nuclear programs were also monitored; for much of this the U-2 spy-plane was employed, including the ability to determine operating facilities by measuring their heat using [[Thermographic camera|infrared cameras]], and to collect high-altitude gas samples from nuclear facility emissions.<ref>''Opt. Cet'', Richelson, pp. 93-96</ref> CORONA missions also continued, primarily using the KH-4A (1963\u20131964) and KH-4B (1967) satellites. These had resolutions of about {{convert|10|ft|m}} and {{convert|6|ft|m}}, respectively, and carried two reentry vehicles, allowing each mission to cover some 18 million square miles.<ref>''Opt. Cet.'', Richelson, p, 122</ref>\n\nWhile the activities of Duckett and the FMSAC were of great value to the CIA, they mainly involved analyses of existing events. Some of the Agency\u2019s strategic consultants strongly suggested that more capability was needed in advancing the basic science and technology used both in collecting information and in predicting future actions of  adversaries. This would involve increasing the size and capabilities of not just the FMSAC but those of Wheelon\u2019s overall organization.\n\nIn May 1966, the organization became a much enlarged [[Central Intelligence Agency Directorate of Science & Technology|Directorate of Science & Technology]] (DS&T), and Duckett replaced Wheelon as leader. With this went the position of Deputy Director of the CIA. While Wheelon held a Ph.D. in physics from MIT and had earlier been a senior scientist at TRW, Duckett had no formal higher education and his only non-government experience was in small-town radio broadcasting. Nevertheless, he was accepted as a leader by scientists and engineers; he was an excellent briefer, \"turning technical data into laymanese,\" and was considered by many to be the Agency\u2019s best \"marketeer\" in selling CIA programs to Congress.<ref>''Opt. Cet.'', Richelson, pp. 131-132</ref> Because of his ability to explain technical matters in understandable terms, [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Henry Kissinger]] often referred to him as \"Professor.\"\n\nFor the next ten years, Duckett served the Nation in this capacity. In addition to the FMSAC, Offices reporting directly to Duckett included Computer Services, Electronic Intelligence, Scientfifc Intelligence, Special Activities, Special Projects, and Research and Development. In 1973, several organizational changes were made: the FMSAC was enlarged to become the Office of Weapons Intelligence, and the Office of Technical Services (OTS) was formed by consolidating activities from other directorates. The OSP became the Office of Development and Engineering, charged with serving the entire CIA. Also, the National Photographic Interpretation Center was placed under the DS&T.\n\nThe new OTS was charged with moving research and development technologies into operations. Included were \u2018James Bond\u2019 devices such as guns disguised as pens and cigarettes; clandestine listening, recording, and transitting devices; special envelopes and other holders of microfilm for dead-drop use; and materials for destroying equipment and incapacitating vehicles. Duckett took a personal interest in many of these projects.<ref>''Opt. Cet.'', Richelson, p. 165</ref>\n\nDuckett\u2019s DS&T was then a complete intelligence service; it established requirements, developed and operated collection systems, and analyzed the data. For his last three years with the CIA, Duckett also served on the Executive Management Committee. In this position, he was the Number Three executive of the Agency, with broad management and fiscal responsibilities for all CIA programs and activities.<ref>''Opt. Cet.''. Richelson, pp. 161-165</ref>\n\nStarting in January 1967, Duckett was also the Director of Program B of the [[National Reconnaissance Office]] (NRO). Upon the recommendation of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the NRO had been established by the Department of Defense in 1960, primarily because of problems in space-reconnaissance management within the Air Force. The existence and operation of the highly secret NRO was divulged by the ''New York Times'' in 1985.<ref>Bamford, James;. \u201cAmerica\u2019s Supersecret Eyes in Space,\u201d ''The New York Times'', January 13, 1985</ref> For 10 years, Duckett held this NRO position in parallel with his position in the CIA.<ref>McLucus, John L.; ''Reflections of a Technocrat,'' Air University Press, 2006, pp. 84-86</ref>\n\nIn June 1976, after 13 years in senior positions and serving under nine DCIs, Duckett retired from the CIA. His request for retirement officially cited health reasons, but privately he said that it was because the new DCI, [[George H. W. Bush]], would not promote him to Deputy DCI. Both reasons were likely true; he had a problem with [[alcoholism]] (later overcome), and for some time had been disappointed in not being further promoted to either of the top two positions.<ref>''Opt. Cet.'', Richelson, pp. 192-193</ref>\n\n==Achievements at the CIA==\n\n===Overhead reconnaissance===\n\nDuring Duckett\u2019s tenure as Director of the DS&T, overhead reconnaissance for gathering intelligence was a major activity. The U-2 spy planes were still active, particularly in flights over China operating from [[Taiwan]]. China\u2019s first [[nuclear fusion]] (hydrogen) bomb had been detonated on June 17, 1967, and the test site was thoroughly photographed just days earlier. The planes, cameras, and [[signals intelligence]] (SIGINT) equipment were continually improved. A typical flight carrying a payload of 3,000 pounds could last seven or more hours, mainly at an altitude of over {{convert|70000|ft|m}}. The last U-2 flights were in mid-1974, surveying the results of the [[Arab-Israeli conflict]].\n\nEven before the [[1960 U-2 incident]] involving a plane shot down over Russia and ending such photoreconnaissance of that country, the CIA was having developed a successor aircraft, the A-12 ''Oxcart.'' With greater \"sprint\" speed (Mach 3.1), reduced [[radar cross-section]], and capable of higher altitude (about 84,000 feet), the A-12 become operational in May 1967; at that time reconnaissance flights over [[North Vietnam]] were conducted out of [[Okinawa Island]]. Early the next year, flights were also made in support of the [[USS Pueblo (AGER-2)|Pueblo Crisis]] with [[North Korea]].\n\nAnother reconnaissance aircraft had been developed for the Air Force; the R-12, later designated the [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird|Lockheed SR-71 ''Blackbird'']].  With operational characteristics similar to those of the A-12, the SR-71 had an advantage in also carrying infrared detectors, side-looking radar, and ELINT gear. The CIA adopted the SR-71 in 1968, and this remained the standard high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft until 1998, without a single loss to enemy action.\n\nFilming through CORONA missions was still important, and a new satellite system was placed into development. Commonly called \"Big Bird\" but officially designated [[KH-9 HEXAGON]], each satellite involved a 30,000-pound cylinder {{convert|40|ft|m}} long and {{convert|10|ft|m}} in diameter, carrying four [[reentry capsule]]s. There were two KH-9 cameras capable of independent operation and with a resolution of two feet. In addition, each HEXAGON carried SIGNIT electronics, collecting Soviet transmissions and also relaying messages sent by cover agents.  The first HEXAGON satellite was launched by a Titan 3D in June 1971. Duckett considered the Big Bird one of his most important accomplishments.\n\nThe time lag involved in overhead-photography imaging systems and the advances being made in electro-optical imaging devices led to a detailed examination of real-time reconnaissance technologies starting in 1969. Duckett tasked [[Leslie C. Dirks]], one of his most capable researchers, with assessing the present and projected technologies, and, with [[Edwin H. Land]] (inventor of the [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] [[Instant camera|Instant Camera]] and senior advisor to the CIA), preparing a plan for the replacement of CORONA. The resulting plan was strongly opposed by the Air Force, but, after personally hearing arguments from both sides in 1971, President Richard Nixon approved Duckett\u2019s approach.\n\nAfter the President\u2019s approval, the [[KH-11 Kennen|KH-11 KENNEN]] Program was started, with Lockheed selected as the prime contractor and Perkin-Elmer grinding the very important collecting mirror. Likely the most secret of all CIA reconnaissance systems, each KH-11 had a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) [[electro-optical sensor]] and an  {{convert|8.7|ft|m|adj=on}} collecting mirror. The digital images were transmitted as real-time signals via a relay satellite to a ground station at [[Fort Belvoir]], Virginia. The first KENNAN launch, by a Titan 3D rocket, took place in 1976, shortly after Dirks had replaced Duckett as the DS&T Director.\n\n===Electronic intelligence===\n\nWith an early background in radio and radar, Duckett had a great personal interest in CIA activities in these fields. Also, Duckett\u2019s FMASC depended strongly on information gained through electronic intelligence (ELINT).\n\nAs previously noted, the CIA had a receiving station in Iran to intercept telemetry signals coming from the Tyuratam test range. In 1965, this was augmented by two stations operated by the DS&T in the high mountains of northeastern Iran and nearer to Tyuratam; at their peak, these stations (designated TACKSMAN I {{coord |36.6846|N|53.5270|E|}} and II {{coord |37.2957|N|58.9152|E|}}) provided the bulk of information on Soviet ICBM development. The CIA also funded ELINT operations in [[Norway]], both at a ground station in the far northeast near [[Kirkenes]] and on a converted whaling boat in the [[Barents Sea]]; these monitored Soviet radio communications and telemetry originating in northwest USSR. \n \nDirect reception of radar signals is limited to line-of-sight distances \u2013 approximately to the horizon. However, by operating in the high-frequency (HF) band (3-30&nbsp;MHz), the signals can be \"bounced\" along a path between the ionosphere and ground, allowing an \"[[over-the-horizon radar|over-the-horizon]]\" (OTH) operation. In early 1961, an OTH radar facility, designated EARTHLING, was set up in Pakistan to track missile and spacecraft launches from the Tyuratam test range. Through 1965, when the facility was closed by Pakistan, over 80 percent of the missile launches had been detected. EARTHLING also provided information on the Soviet's nuclear tests at high altitudes. An OTH radar, designated CHECKROTE, was opened on Taiwan in 1966; this was primarily to monitor missile launches from the Shuangchengzi test range in China. Greatly upgraded in 1969, CHECKROTE was a highly successful project.\n\nA very important intelligence item in the 1960-70s was the characteristics of Soviet radars, particularly those systems associated with their defense systems against bombers and ballistic missiles. U-2 and A-12 aircraft flew special missions to gather this information. The most novel collection means was through signals from Soviet radars reflected by the moon; a facility for such collection was set up by the CIA at Stanford University in 1966.\n\nShortly after he became the Director of the DS&T, Wheelon had proposed using a [[geosynchronous satellite]] to relay very-high and ultra-high frequency (VHF and UHF) telemetry signals from Soviet test sites to CIA control stations. (VHF and UHF signals cannot be directly received beyond the horizon because they are passed through, not reflected by, the ionosphere.)  At the start of 1966, development of such a monitoring system, designated RHYOLITE, got underway. In a few months, Duckett took over the DS&T and implementation of the RHYOLITE program. A receiving/control site {{coord |23.799|S|133.735|E|}} was selected near [[Alice Springs]] in the Australian [[Outback]], safe from eavesdropping and signal interference by Soviet spy ships.\n\nThe first RHYOLITE satellite was launched into its {{convert|22300|mi|km|adj=on}} high, [[geostationary orbit]] by an Atlas-Agena D rocket in June 1969. The primary mission was to monitor Soviet missile tests, but it was also capable of intercepting VHF and UHF communications; it found great usefulness in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], and later in the [[Vietnam War]] and subsequent conflicts.\n\n===Missile intelligence and Safeguard===\n\nIn March 1969, newly elected President [[Richard Nixon]] announced to the public that he was authorizing the implementation of an [[anti-ballistic missile]] system, called [[Safeguard Program|Safeguard]], to counter a potentially devastating Soviet threat. At that time, there was a balance between the United States and the Soviet Union based on [[Mutual assured destruction|Mutual Assured Destruction]]; this assumed that a [[first strike]] could not eliminate the capability for retaliation.\n\nSome studies had shown that Soviet ICBMs carrying [[multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle]]s (MIRVs) \u2013 several nuclear warheads aimed at different targets \u2013 could destroy a large part of U.S. ICBMs then emplaced in silos. In the fall of 1968, tests of SS-9 Mod 4 ICBMs had been monitored in which three warheads were dispensed, each supposedly capable of carrying up to five megaton-size nuclear bombs. The data, however, were not sufficient for the FMSAC to firmly determine if these were MIRVs or simply three warheads reentering in a row; this difference would have a major impact on their threat to the U.S. defense.\n\nThis was a subject of great debate for several months, and critical for Congress to reach a decision on President Nixon\u2019s authorization for Safeguard. Although he had personally concluded that the Soviets did not have MIRV capability, Duckett prepared a paper objectively presenting both sides of the technical debate. On July 17, 1969, with only senators present, Duckett\u2019s paper was read to the Senate. In the final vote on August 6, Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]] broke an even split in Congress by favoring the program. Although the effort was still shrouded in top secrecy, there were sufficient \"leaks\" to allow the news media to call attention to the role of the CIA in such matters.<ref>Lundberg, Kriston; \u201cThe SS-9 Controversy: Intelligence as Political Football;\u201d Case No. C16-89-884.0, Kennedy School of Government, 1989, p. 1; pp. 17-18</ref>\n\n===Submarine espionage===\n\nIn March 1968, a Soviet [[Golf class submarine]] imploded \u2013 generally believed to be while on the surface recharging its batteries \u2013  and sank in about {{convert|17000|ft|m}} of ocean some {{convert|1700|mi|km}} northwest of [[Hawaii]]. The Soviet Fleet immediately started a major effort to locate the sub, but gave up in a few weeks, The U.S. Navy\u2019s [[Sound Surveillance System]] (SOSUS) \u2013 a network of [[hydrophone]] arrays \u2013 had initially tracked the sub, and [[triangulation]] had been used to identify the general location where the accident occurred. The [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] (ONI) then arranged for a spy submarine, the [[USS Halibut (SSGN-587)|USS ''Halibut'']], to search for the missing sub. During the summer of 1968, long cables lowered lights and cameras, and in August found the sub broken into several large pieces. The forward {{convert|200|ft|m|adj=on}} section contained the sub\u2019s three missile launch tubes, one with an apparently intact nuclear-tipped missile.\n\nThere was great interest in attempting a recovery of items such as cipher machines, code manuals, communications equipment, and possibly a torpedo or even a nuclear warhead. Both the Navy and the CIA started plans for a major salvage effort. The Navy proposed cutting into the sub\u2019s hull and recovering whatever items could be reached. In a joint meeting, the Navy presented its recommended plan. They were staggered, however, when Duckett and the CIA team recommended a gigantic effort to recover an entire {{convert|200|ft|m|adj=on}} intact section, raising it the three miles (5&nbsp;km) to the surface.\n\nAfter an intense debate at all levels, Duckett\u2019s proposal was eventually approved by President Richard Nixon. [[Howard Hughes]] agreed for his firm, [[Summa Corporation]], to build a {{convert|618|ft|m|adj=on}} long ship (the [[GSF Explorer|Glomar Explorer]], ostensibly a deep-water, manganese-mining vessel). This had a companion football-field-sized barge (the ''Hughes Marine Barge-1'') that was carried below the ship and thus hidden from overhead observation. Eight giant claws operating from the barge would lift the intact section of the Golf sub from the ocean floor and into an opening on the bottom of the ship. The activity was code-name [[Project Azorian|Project AZORIAN]] (sometimes JENNIFER), and publicly justified as a means of rescuing or recovering future U.S. vessels.<ref>''Opt. Cet.'', Richelson, pp. 133-135</ref>\n\nIt was July 1974 before the ''Glomar'' and the ''Barge'' began the raising attempt. When the section was lifted about {{convert|3000|ft|m}} off the seabed, one of the claws broke, followed by a collapse and shattering of the entire section. All but a small portion \u2013 some 10 percent of the original sub \u2013 fell back to the ocean floor. The lost portions included the items most desired by the intelligence community. Six bodies were in the recovered section, and were given a formal burial at sea.<ref>Sontag, Sherry, and Christopher Drew; ''Blind Man\u2019s Bluff: The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage'', PublicAffairs, 1989</ref>\n\n===Parapsychology intelligence===\n\nIn the early 1970s, two laser scientists at the [[SRI International|Stanford Research Institute]] (SRI) began research in [[parapsychology]]. In a meeting with representatives of the DS&T, they claimed to have found witnesses of Soviet successes in psychokinetics \u2013 use of the mind for moving physical objects \u2013 and had themselves conducted positive research in mentally viewing remote objects and scenes \u2013 [[astral projection]].\n\nThe CIA had long conducted research in the area of behavioral control. Throughout the 1950s and into the 1960s, there was extensive testing of the effects of hypnosis and drugs, particularly [[lysergic acid diethylamide]] (LSD) on human subjects. The bulk of these activities were conducted by the Technical Services Staff, forerunner of the Technical Services Department (TSD). Thus, when the SRI scientists presented their information on mind control, Duckett assigned this to the TSD.\n\nIn October 1972, the TSD initiated the Biofield Measurements Program, to be conducted jointly with SRI, to determine whether participants (the viewers or percipients) could reliably identify and accurately describe salient features of remote locations or targets. This was in part justified by attempts to find what progress the Soviets were making in parapsychology and how it might be used against the United States. Two test subjects (persons claiming paranormal abilities) were provided by the SRI. Early in the following year, reported successes in \"remote viewing\" by the percipients were such that other units of the DS&T joined in the effort. A management review of the program was made in the summer of 1973, and both Duckett and the CIA Executive Director [[William Colby]] allowed the activity to continue.\n\nA carefully planned experiment was conducted in July 1974. Duckett asked that this center on a description made by remote viewing of a target area in the Soviet Union that had been recently imaged by a satellite and suspected to be a nuclear test site. In sessions over a four-day period, the test subjects gave mentally derived descriptions of the site; these descriptions were then independently evaluated by a scientist from the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]  The overall judgement of the evaluator was that the remote viewing appeared to be a failure; nevertheless, continued low-level research in parapsychology intelligence was allowed by Duckett until he retired in June 1976.\n\n==Controversy at the CIA==\n\nDuckett was aware of the ongoing experiments being conducted on U.S. servicemen at [[Edgewood Arsenal human experiments|Edgewood]], in which the CIA had commercial drug manufacturers provide them with samples of drugs rejected for commercial sale in order to study how their \"unfavorable side effects\" would modify behavior.<ref name=\"Washington Post\">{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/26/AR2007062601689.html |title=Experimenting with the Mind|date=2007-06-27}}</ref>  Duckett maintained that the experiments were not being conducted for offensive purposes stating that they were \"defensive, in the sense that we would be able to recognize certain behavior if similar materials were used against Americans.\"  However, in the disclosed CIA [[Family Jewels (Central Intelligence Agency)|Family Jewels]] document, he was on record as saying that he thought \"the Director would be ill-advised to say he is acquainted with this program (meaning [[Edgewood Arsenal human experiments|Edgewood]]).\"<ref name=\"George Washington University Archives\">{{cite web |url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB222/top04.pdf |title=Family Jewels Memorandum|date=1973-05-08}}</ref>\n\n==Post CIA and miscellaneous==\n\nAfter retiring from the CIA in 1976, Carl Duckett joined the firm Intec, Inc., of [[McLean, Virginia]], as Chairman of the Board and President. He had retained top levels of security clearance and, through Intec, provided a number of aerospace industries with consulting services and analytical studies in technical intelligence and electronic warfare. He also served on advisory panels for the Senate Select Committee for Intelligence and the [[President's Intelligence Advisory Board|President\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board]]. Having earlier been divorced, he married Ann Marie Bell in 1978.\n\nIn 1985, Duckett opened an Intec office at Mathews Court House, Virginia, and moved his residence to a bay-side farm near [[Hudgins, Virginia]]. For a period of time, he also served as the Magistrate of [[Mathews County, Virginia]]. He continued working for Intec until early 1992, but died of lung cancer in a medical center at [[Newport News, Virginia]], on April 1, 1992, and was buried in the Gwynn\u2019s Island Cemetery near his farm. He was survived by his wife, Ann Marie, and, from his first marriage, Nannie Jane; two sons, Ernest Pannell (1942) and Arthur Lee (1946); and a daughter, Ruth Eleanor (1948).\n\nIn his professional career, Carl Duckett received the following special awards and decorations:\n* [[Distinguished Intelligence Medal]] (CIA\u2014twice received)\n* [[Commendation Medal]] (U. S. Army)\n* Leadership Award [[National Civil Service Reform League]]\n* George Goddard Award ([[SPIE]], Soc. of  Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engrs.)\n* Control, Communications, and Intelligence Award ([[Association of Old Crows]]).\n\nAs a part of its 50th anniversary celebration in 1997, the Central Intelligence Agency gave Trailblazer Awards to 50 Agency officers, \"from our earliest days to the present, who by their actions, example, innovations, or initiative, have taken the CIA in important new directions and helped shape our history.\" Carl E. Duckett was one of the honored recipients of a Trailblazer Award.\n\n== References ==\n<!--- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== General ===\n* Day, Dwayne A.; ''et al'' (eds.); ''Eye in the Sky: The Story of CORONA Spy Satellites,'' Smithsonian Institution Press, 1998, pp.&nbsp;48\u201385\n* Killian, James R., Jr.; ''Sputniks, Scientists, and Eisenhower'', MIT Press, 1982\n* Kress, Kenneth A.; \"Parapsychology in Intelligence: A Personal Review and Conclusions,\" ''Studies in Intelligence'', vol. 21, no. 4 (Winter 1977) pp.&nbsp;7\u201317\n* Pedlow, Gregory W., and Donald W.

Duckett\" in Agenda for Central Intelligence Agency'a 50th Anniversary Trailblazer Awards Ceremony, Sept. 18, 1997</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\nCarl Duckett was born and raised in [[Swannanoa, North Carolina]], an unincorporated community a few miles east of [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]]. He attended the [[Buncombe County, North Carolina|Buncombe County]] schools in Swannanoa, graduating from high school in 1940. His father was a construction laborer at the Beacon Blanket Manufacturing Company, the epicenter of the Swannanoa community, and he wanted his son to start a career at the mill. Carl\u2019s ambition, however, was to work in [[radio broadcasting]], and he left Swannanoa to search for work in this field.<ref>Much of the general information on Duckett\u2019s background prior to mid-1963 came from ''Carl Ernest Duckett, Personal History Statement; Form 444, Central Intelligence Agency, 21 August 1963'', the narrative provided with his application to join the Central Intelligence Agency.</ref>\n\nWith a good speaking voice, some musical talent, and a very persuasive nature, Duckett eventually found beginner employment at [[WMVA]], a small station being established in [[Martinsville, Virginia]]. While there, he married Nannie Jane Law in 1941, and started a family.<ref>From interview with family member.</ref> He also gained an elementary knowledge of [[radio electronics]], and, to prepare for a better job, attended part-time for six months a course in this field at the nearby [[Danville Community College|Danville Technical Institute]].\n\nIn early 1943, Duckett was employed as a [[technician]] by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. Apparently a fast learner, he was soon assigned to work on Army radars for [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] fire control. During this period, he also attended courses in radio engineering under the Government-sponsored [[Engineering, Science, and Management War Training]] (ESMWT) Program at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. In 1944, he was a member of a team sent to England to advise on the use of Westinghouse [[SCR-584 radar]] equipment for [[V-1 (flying bomb)|V-1 \u2018buzz bomb\u2019]] defense, and stayed as a field engineer during the [[Invasion of Normandy|Normandy invasion]].\n\nDrafted into the U.S. Army in October 1944, Duckett served in the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]] until July 1946. As a radar specialist, he rapidly advanced from [[Private (rank)|Private]] to [[Master Sergeant]], with assignments that included the [[Radiation Laboratory]] (Rad Lab) at MIT, the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater of Operations]], and the [[White Sands Missile Range|White Sands Proving Grounds]] (WSPG) in [[New Mexico]]. While at White Sands, he participated in the first launch in the U.S. of a captured German [[V-2]] rocket and gained knowledge of the [[telemetry]] equipment used in this testing.\n\nFollowing his discharge from the Army, Duckett returned to radio broadcasting in Martinsville. He also received a [[General radiotelephone operator license|First-Class Commercial Radiotelephone License]] from the [[Federal Communications Commission]], making him eligible for higher positions in this field, and joined in establishing radio station [[WCGX|WBOB]] in [[Galax, Virginia]]. After the station went on the air in April 1947, he was not only the chief engineer but also served as the station manager and an announcer/[[disk jockey]].<ref>Alicoate, John, (ed); \u201cWBOB; Galax, Virginia,\u201d ''1948 Radio Annual'', Radio Daily, 1948, p. 669</ref> Highly aggressive in these activities, he was one of the founders of a Virginia-wide association of news broadcasters (1949)<ref>\u201cRadio Stations Form Virginia Press Caster Organization,\u201d ''Billboard Magazine'', Mar. 5, 1949, p. 6</ref> and represented Virginia radio stations in a meeting with President [[Harry S.

As the [[Korean War]] started, he was called back to active duty in October 1950, and soon received a [[Direct commission officer|direct commission]] as a [[Second Lieutenant]]. After completing the Signal Officer\u2019s School at [[Fort Monmouth, New Jersey]], he was again assigned to White Sands. There his progressive duties included Commander of a remotely located radar station, Chief of the Radar Instrumentation Division, and Project Manager of the first test-range microwave communication system. He was promoted to [[First Lieutenant]] and remained at White Sands until reverting to Retired Reserves status in June 1953. Three years later, he received the rank of [[Captain (land)|Captain]] in the Reserves.\n\nUpon leaving Army active duty, Duckett remained at White Sands as a [[Civil service|civil-service]] employee. During a three-year tenure at WSPG, he progressed from [[General Schedule]] (GS) Grade 12 to Grade 15 in positions that included Deputy Assistant for Engineering; Chief, Plans and Programs Office; and Scientific Advisor to the Signal Officer.\n\nThe team of German scientists and engineers under [[Wernher von Braun]], initially brought to the U.S. under [[Operation Paperclip]], had worked at [[Fort Bliss, Texas]], and tested their missiles at nearby WSPG. After being moved to [[Redstone Arsenal]], [[Huntsville, Alabama]], in 1950, they continued to use the ranges at White Sands. While in the Army and in civil service positions, Duckett worked closely with this team and others from Redstone Arsenal, and became intimately familiar with the telemetry systems that were originally developed in Germany at the [[Peenem\u00fcnde Army Research Center]], as well as the newer American derivative systems.\n\nActivities at Redstone Arsenal evolved from the small Ordnance Guided Missile Center in 1950, through the development of the [[PGM-11 Redstone|Redstone Rocket]], and the opening of the [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency]] (ABMA) in 1956. The ABMA was responsible for a wide variety of missiles, including [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter]], the Army\u2019s first [[medium-range ballistic missile]]. In July 1956, Duckett accepted a civil service position with the ABMA, joining the Guidance and Control Laboratory as a telemetry specialist and serving as a Scientific Advisor to the Commanding Officer, Major General [[John B. Medaris]].<ref>Personal interviews with several individuals who worked with or for Duckett at Redstone Arsenal.</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1950s, the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) set up a [[listening station]] near the coastal town of [[Sinop, Turkey]], directly across the [[Black Sea]] from the [[Kapustin Yar]] range, where the Soviets were testing medium-range missiles. In early 1957, it became known that the [[Soviet Union]] was testing an [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM) at their Tyuratam range and soon a listening station was opened by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) at [[Behshahr]] in northeast [[Iran]], some {{convert|1000|mi|km}} across the [[Caspian Sea]]. Tapes were made of signals obtained by these listening post, and an ''ad hoc'' activity called Jam Session was started by the CIA for their interpretation; Duckett was a Jam Session participant. They soon recognized that the Russians were using the same telemetry frequencies and formats originally developed by the Germans during World War II.<ref>''Opt. Cet.'', Redstone Arsenal Interviews</ref>\n\nOn October 4, 1957, America was shaken by the launch by the Soviet Union of the first artificial satellite, ''[[Sputnik I]]''. The U.S. Air Force and the CIA assembled a highly secret Telemetry and Beacon Analysis Committee (TABAC) to analyze the signals recorded from the launch at Tyuratam and those heard all over the world from ''Sputnik''. From his work in Jam Session, Duckett was asked to be a leader in the TABAC effort. It required about 18 months to calibrate the signals and understand how they related to the launch vehicle characteristics.<ref>Taubman, Philip; ''Secret Empire: Eisenhower, the CIA, and the Hidden Story of America\u2019s Space Espionage'', Simon & Schuster, 2003, p. 335</ref> The payoff, however, was significant; for the next two decades this provided the U.S a major window into the operation of Soviet missiles.<ref>''Opt. Cet.'', Redstone Arsenal Interviews</ref>\n\nIn mid-1958, the ABMA was absorbed into the newly formed Army Ordnance Missile Command (AOMC), headquartered on Redstone Arsenal. At that time, a small Signals Intelligence Group, led by Duckett, was established as a separate unit. In early 1961, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) formed the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA), integrating all of the defense intelligence in the DoD. The AOMC had the DoD\u2019s most extensive capability for analyzing missiles; thus, to support the DIA, in December the Missile Intelligence Office (MIO) was made an official organization on the AOMC Commanding General\u2019s Staff; Duckett was named Chief of the MIO.<ref>\u201cCarl E. Duckett Named Chief of Missile Intelligence Office,\u201d ''Redstone Rocket'', vol. X, no. 32 (Dec. 13), 1961, p. 2</ref>\n \nFrom the start, one of the most significant activities of the MIO was the analysis of public and clandestine photographs of Soviet missiles and their launch sites, and from these and telemetry signals, estimating the missile capabilities. Sometimes models of the pictured missiles were built and tested in the AOMC [[wind tunnel]]s for determining their [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] characteristics.<ref>''Opt. Cet.'', Redstone Arsenal Interviews</ref>\n\nStarting in mid-1956, the CIA began [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] aircraft flights over the [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR) and the [[People\u2019s Republic of China]] (PRC).  These carried cameras that provided pictures with a resolution of {{convert|2.5|ft|m}} from an altitude of {{convert|60000|ft|m}} and higher; they were of great value in identifying missiles being manufactured and on the launch sites. In mid-1959, the CIA initiated [[Corona (satellite)|CORONA]], the program name for a series of satellites with increasingly more accurate cameras. The exposed film was ejected in a capsule with a parachute and then caught in the air by aircraft. The first successful mission, designated Keyhole 1 (KH-1), took place in August 1960. Some 1,400 photos were taken, covering more of the Soviet Union than all of the prior U-2 overflights combined. The resolution, however, was nowhere close to that obtained from U-2 cameras.,<ref>Peebles, Curtis; ''The Corona Project: America\u2019s First Spy Satellites'', Naval Inst. Press, 1997</ref>\n\nIn August 1962, the AOMC was expanded to become the Army Missile Command (AMC) and the MIO became the Missile Intelligence Directorate (MID), with Duckett as the Director. Duckett and others from the MID participated in the CORONA photo interpretation. The Committee on Overhead Reconnaissance (COR) was formed by the CIA to select areas for imaging; Duckett was a COR member. As the [[Cold War]] between America and the Soviet Union intensified, the COR selected [[Cuba]] as an imaging target.\n\nThe [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] began in September 1962, when CORONA imagery indicated likely missile launch sites being surreptitiously built at several sites across the island. On October 14, to obtain clearer images, U-2 reconnaissance aircraft flew over the suspected areas, each flight obtaining about 4,000 pictures. A joint CIA and DoD activity called Photographic Interpretation Center (PGIC) was responsible for interpreting such data. Led by Duckett, a team of image interpreters from the MID assembled at the PGIC and quickly released its top secret report identifying the sites as those for Soviet [[R-12 Dvina|R-12 ''Dvina'']] (NATO designation SS-4 ''Sandal'') medium-range ballistic missiles, and Soviet [[R-14 Chusovaya|R-14 ''Chusovaya'']] (NATO designation SS-5 ''Skean'') [[intermediate-range ballistic missile]]s. President [[John F. Kennedy]] imposed a military blockade of Cuba, and the confrontation ended on October 28, 1962, when Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] agreed to dismantle the offensive missiles and return them to the USSR.<ref>Correll, John T.; \"Airpower and the Cuban Missile Crisis,\u201d ''Air Force Magazine'', vol. 88, no. 8 (August 2005). http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2005/August%202005/0805u2.aspx.</ref>\n\n==Central Intelligence Agency==\n\nThe Central Intelligence Agency was formed in July 1947, at the direction of President [[Harry S. Truman]]. The CIA would be headed by a [[Director of Central Intelligence]] (DCI), reporting directly to the President. From the start, and for several following years, it was not widely accepted that the CIA was responsible for producing scientific intelligence.\n\nThe great importance of science and technology in intelligence was clearly shown in the Cuban Missile Crisis. Thus, in August 1963, a number of technical operations in the three existing directorates of the CIA were consolidated to form the Deputy Directorate of Science and Technology (DDS&T) with [[Albert D. Wheelon]] as the leader. In November, a Foreign Missile and Space Analysis Center (FMSAC) was formed in the DDS&T. Having worked with him on Jam Session and TABAC, Wheelon was well aware of Duckett\u2019s capabilities, and enticed him to leave the MID in Huntsville and head the FMSAC.<ref>Richelson, Jeffrey T.; ''The Wizards of Langley: Inside the CIA\u2019s Directorate of Science and Technology\u2019\u2019, Westview Press, 2002, pp. 80-81</ref>\n\nDuring the next several years, Duckett and the FMSAC were kept busy with Soviet accomplishments: ''Cosmos'' reconnaissance and ''Molniya'' communication spacecraft; ''Voshkov'' and the first spacewalk and ''Venera'' missions past Venus in 1965; and the ''Luna'' soft landing on the moon and the transmission of surface images in 1966 that put the Soviets ahead in the moon race. Of perhaps greater concern were Soviet ballistic missiles: third-generation ICBMs (NATO designations [[R-36 (missile)|SS-9]], [[UR-100 (missile)|SS-11]], and [[SS-13 Savage|SS-13]]), as well as submarine-launched intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) that could easily reach U.S. territory.\n\nIn addition to telemetry, Duckett and the FMSAC analyzed radar, optical, and photographic information. For collection, the electronic intelligence receiving station in Iran continued, and other stations were established in [[Norway]] and on ships. A {{convert|150|ft|m|adj=on}} dish antenna at [[Stanford University]] was used to monitor Soviet radar signals after they bounced off the Moon. Chinese missile and nuclear programs were also monitored; for much of this the U-2 spy-plane was employed, including the ability to determine operating facilities by measuring their heat using [[Thermographic camera|infrared cameras]], and to collect high-altitude gas samples from nuclear facility emissions.<ref>''Opt. Cet'', Richelson, pp. 93-96</ref> CORONA missions also continued, primarily using the KH-4A (1963\u20131964) and KH-4B (1967) satellites. These had resolutions of about {{convert|10|ft|m}} and {{convert|6|ft|m}}, respectively, and carried two reentry vehicles, allowing each mission to cover some 18 million square miles.<ref>''Opt. Cet.'', Richelson, p, 122</ref>\n\nWhile the activities of Duckett and the FMSAC were of great value to the CIA, they mainly involved analyses of existing events. Some of the Agency\u2019s strategic consultants strongly suggested that more capability was needed in advancing the basic science and technology used both in collecting information and in predicting future actions of  adversaries. This would involve increasing the size and capabilities of not just the FMSAC but those of Wheelon\u2019s overall organization.\n\nIn May 1966, the organization became a much enlarged [[Central Intelligence Agency Directorate of Science & Technology|Directorate of Science & Technology]] (DS&T), and Duckett replaced Wheelon as leader. With this went the position of Deputy Director of the CIA. While Wheelon held a Ph.D. in physics from MIT and had earlier been a senior scientist at TRW, Duckett had no formal higher education and his only non-government experience was in small-town radio broadcasting. Nevertheless, he was accepted as a leader by scientists and engineers; he was an excellent briefer, \"turning technical data into laymanese,\" and was considered by many to be the Agency\u2019s best \"marketeer\" in selling CIA programs to Congress.<ref>''Opt. Cet.'', Richelson, pp. 131-132</ref> Because of his ability to explain technical matters in understandable terms, [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Henry Kissinger]] often referred to him as \"Professor.\"\n\nFor the next ten years, Duckett served the Nation in this capacity. In addition to the FMSAC, Offices reporting directly to Duckett included Computer Services, Electronic Intelligence, Scientfifc Intelligence, Special Activities, Special Projects, and Research and Development. In 1973, several organizational changes were made: the FMSAC was enlarged to become the Office of Weapons Intelligence, and the Office of Technical Services (OTS) was formed by consolidating activities from other directorates. The OSP became the Office of Development and Engineering, charged with serving the entire CIA. Also, the National Photographic Interpretation Center was placed under the DS&T.\n\nThe new OTS was charged with moving research and development technologies into operations. Included were \u2018James Bond\u2019 devices such as guns disguised as pens and cigarettes; clandestine listening, recording, and transitting devices; special envelopes and other holders of microfilm for dead-drop use; and materials for destroying equipment and incapacitating vehicles. Duckett took a personal interest in many of these projects.<ref>''Opt. Cet.'', Richelson, p. 165</ref>\n\nDuckett\u2019s DS&T was then a complete intelligence service; it established requirements, developed and operated collection systems, and analyzed the data. For his last three years with the CIA, Duckett also served on the Executive Management Committee. In this position, he was the Number Three executive of the Agency, with broad management and fiscal responsibilities for all CIA programs and activities.<ref>''Opt. Cet.''. Richelson, pp. 161-165</ref>\n\nStarting in January 1967, Duckett was also the Director of Program B of the [[National Reconnaissance Office]] (NRO). Upon the recommendation of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the NRO had been established by the Department of Defense in 1960, primarily because of problems in space-reconnaissance management within the Air Force. The existence and operation of the highly secret NRO was divulged by the ''New York Times'' in 1985.<ref>Bamford, James;. \u201cAmerica\u2019s Supersecret Eyes in Space,\u201d ''The New York Times'', January 13, 1985</ref> For 10 years, Duckett held this NRO position in parallel with his position in the CIA.<ref>McLucus, John L.; ''Reflections of a Technocrat,'' Air University Press, 2006, pp. 84-86</ref>\n\nIn June 1976, after 13 years in senior positions and serving under nine DCIs, Duckett retired from the CIA. His request for retirement officially cited health reasons, but privately he said that it was because the new DCI, [[George H. W. Bush]], would not promote him to Deputy DCI. Both reasons were likely true; he had a problem with [[alcoholism]] (later overcome), and for some time had been disappointed in not being further promoted to either of the top two positions.<ref>''Opt. Cet.'', Richelson, pp. 192-193</ref>\n\n==Achievements at the CIA==\n\nWhile many science and technology advancements were made in intelligence under Duckett\u2019s leadership, only a few of the better known will be mentioned; these are described in great detail in Jeffrey Richelson\u2019s book, ''The Wizards of Langley. Inside the CIA\u2019s Directorare of Science and Technology''.\n\n===Overhead reconnaissance===\n\nDuring Duckett\u2019s tenure as Director of the DS&T, overhead reconnaissance for gathering intelligence was a major activity. The U-2 spy planes were still active, particularly in flights over China operating from [[Taiwan]]. China\u2019s first [[nuclear fusion]] (hydrogen) bomb had been detonated on June 17, 1967, and the test site was thoroughly photographed just days earlier. The planes, cameras, and [[signals intelligence]] (SIGINT) equipment were continually improved. A typical flight carrying a payload of 3,000 pounds could last seven or more hours, mainly at an altitude of over {{convert|70000|ft|m}}. The last U-2 flights were in mid-1974, surveying the results of the [[Arab-Israeli conflict]].\n\nEven before the [[1960 U-2 incident]] involving a plane shot down over Russia and ending such photoreconnaissance of that country, the CIA was having developed a successor aircraft, the A-12 ''Oxcart.'' With greater \"sprint\" speed (Mach 3.1), reduced [[radar cross-section]], and capable of higher altitude (about 84,000 feet), the A-12 become operational in May 1967; at that time reconnaissance flights over [[North Vietnam]] were conducted out of [[Okinawa Island]]. Early the next year, flights were also made in support of the [[USS Pueblo (AGER-2)|Pueblo Crisis]] with [[North Korea]].\n\nAnother reconnaissance aircraft had been developed for the Air Force; the R-12, later designated the [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird|Lockheed SR-71 ''Blackbird'']].  With operational characteristics similar to those of the A-12, the SR-71 had an advantage in also carrying infrared detectors, side-looking radar, and ELINT gear. The CIA adopted the SR-71 in 1968, and this remained the standard high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft until 1998, without a single loss to enemy action.\n\nFilming through CORONA missions was still important, and a new satellite system was placed into development. Commonly called \"Big Bird\" but officially designated [[KH-9 HEXAGON]], each satellite involved a 30,000-pound cylinder {{convert|40|ft|m}} long and {{convert|10|ft|m}} in diameter, carrying four [[reentry capsule]]s. There were two KH-9 cameras capable of independent operation and with a resolution of two feet. In addition, each HEXAGON carried SIGNIT electronics, collecting Soviet transmissions and also relaying messages sent by cover agents.  The first HEXAGON satellite was launched by a Titan 3D in June 1971. Duckett considered the Big Bird one of his most important accomplishments.\n\nThe time lag involved in overhead-photography imaging systems and the advances being made in electro-optical imaging devices led to a detailed examination of real-time reconnaissance technologies starting in 1969. Duckett tasked [[Leslie C. Dirks]], one of his most capable researchers, with assessing the present and projected technologies, and, with [[Edwin H. Land]] (inventor of the [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] [[Instant camera|Instant Camera]] and senior advisor to the CIA), preparing a plan for the replacement of CORONA. The resulting plan was strongly opposed by the Air Force, but, after personally hearing arguments from both sides in 1971, President Richard Nixon approved Duckett\u2019s approach.\n\nAfter the President\u2019s approval, the [[KH-11 Kennen|KH-11 KENNEN]] Program was started, with Lockheed selected as the prime contractor and Perkin-Elmer grinding the very important collecting mirror. Likely the most secret of all CIA reconnaissance systems, each KH-11 had a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) [[electro-optical sensor]] and an  {{convert|8.7|ft|m|adj=on}} collecting mirror. The digital images were transmitted as real-time signals via a relay satellite to a ground station at [[Fort Belvoir]], Virginia. The first KENNAN launch, by a Titan 3D rocket, took place in 1976, shortly after Dirks had replaced Duckett as the DS&T Director.\n\n===Electronic intelligence===\n\nWith an early background in radio and radar, Duckett had a great personal interest in CIA activities in these fields. Also, Duckett\u2019s FMASC depended strongly on information gained through electronic intelligence (ELINT).\n\nAs previously noted, the CIA had a receiving station in Iran to intercept telemetry signals coming from the Tyuratam test range. In 1965, this was augmented by two stations operated by the DS&T in the high mountains of northeastern Iran and nearer to Tyuratam; at their peak, these stations (designated TACKSMAN I {{coord |36.6846|N|53.5270|E|}} and II {{coord |37.2957|N|58.9152|E|}}) provided the bulk of information on Soviet ICBM development. The CIA also funded ELINT operations in [[Norway]], both at a ground station in the far northeast near [[Kirkenes]] and on a converted whaling boat in the [[Barents Sea]]; these monitored Soviet radio communications and telemetry originating in northwest USSR. \n \nDirect reception of radar signals is limited to line-of-sight distances \u2013 approximately to the horizon. However, by operating in the high-frequency (HF) band (3-30&nbsp;MHz), the signals can be \"bounced\" along a path between the ionosphere and ground, allowing an \"[[over-the-horizon radar|over-the-horizon]]\" (OTH) operation. In early 1961, an OTH radar facility, designated EARTHLING, was set up in Pakistan to track missile and spacecraft launches from the Tyuratam test range. Through 1965, when the facility was closed by Pakistan, over 80 percent of the missile launches had been detected. EARTHLING also provided information on the Soviet's nuclear tests at high altitudes. An OTH radar, designated CHECKROTE, was opened on Taiwan in 1966; this was primarily to monitor missile launches from the Shuangchengzi test range in China. Greatly upgraded in 1969, CHECKROTE was a highly successful project.\n\nA very important intelligence item in the 1960-70s was the characteristics of Soviet radars, particularly those systems associated with their defense systems against bombers and ballistic missiles. U-2 and A-12 aircraft flew special missions to gather this information. The most novel collection means was through signals from Soviet radars reflected by the moon; a facility for such collection was set up by the CIA at Stanford University in 1966.\n\nShortly after he became the Director of the DS&T, Wheelon had proposed using a [[geosynchronous satellite]] to relay very-high and ultra-high frequency (VHF and UHF) telemetry signals from Soviet test sites to CIA control stations. (VHF and UHF signals cannot be directly received beyond the horizon because they are passed through, not reflected by, the ionosphere.)  At the start of 1966, development of such a monitoring system, designated RHYOLITE, got underway. In a few months, Duckett took over the DS&T and implementation of the RHYOLITE program. A receiving/control site {{coord |23.799|S|133.735|E|}} was selected near [[Alice Springs]] in the Australian [[Outback]], safe from eavesdropping and signal interference by Soviet spy ships.\n\nThe first RHYOLITE satellite was launched into its {{convert|22300|mi|km|adj=on}} high, [[geostationary orbit]] by an Atlas-Agena D rocket in June 1969. The primary mission was to monitor Soviet missile tests, but it was also capable of intercepting VHF and UHF communications; it found great usefulness in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], and later in the [[Vietnam War]] and subsequent conflicts.\n\n===Missile intelligence and Safeguard===\n\nIn March 1969, newly elected President [[Richard Nixon]] announced to the public that he was authorizing the implementation of an [[anti-ballistic missile]] system, called [[Safeguard Program|Safeguard]], to counter a potentially devastating Soviet threat. At that time, there was a balance between the United States and the Soviet Union based on [[Mutual assured destruction|Mutual Assured Destruction]]; this assumed that a [[first strike]] could not eliminate the capability for retaliation.\n\nSome studies had shown that Soviet ICBMs carrying [[multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle]]s (MIRVs) \u2013 several nuclear warheads aimed at different targets \u2013 could destroy a large part of U.S. ICBMs then emplaced in silos. In the fall of 1968, tests of SS-9 Mod 4 ICBMs had been monitored in which three warheads were dispensed, each supposedly capable of carrying up to five megaton-size nuclear bombs. The data, however, were not sufficient for the FMSAC to firmly determine if these were MIRVs or simply three warheads reentering in a row; this difference would have a major impact on their threat to the U.S. defense.\n\nThis was a subject of great debate for several months, and critical for Congress to reach a decision on President Nixon\u2019s authorization for Safeguard. Although he had personally concluded that the Soviets did not have MIRV capability, Duckett prepared a paper objectively presenting both sides of the technical debate. On July 17, 1969, with only senators present, Duckett\u2019s paper was read to the Senate. In the final vote on August 6, Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]] broke an even split in Congress by favoring the program. Although the effort was still shrouded in top secrecy, there were sufficient \"leaks\" to allow the news media to call attention to the role of the CIA in such matters.<ref>Lundberg, Kriston; \u201cThe SS-9 Controversy: Intelligence as Political Football;\u201d Case No. C16-89-884.0, Kennedy School of Government, 1989, p. 1; pp. 17-18</ref>\n\n===Submarine espionage===\n\nIn March 1968, a Soviet [[Golf class submarine]] imploded \u2013 generally believed to be while on the surface recharging its batteries \u2013  and sank in about {{convert|17000|ft|m}} of ocean some {{convert|1700|mi|km}} northwest of [[Hawaii]]. The Soviet Fleet immediately started a major effort to locate the sub, but gave up in a few weeks, The U.S. Navy\u2019s [[Sound Surveillance System]] (SOSUS) \u2013 a network of [[hydrophone]] arrays \u2013 had initially tracked the sub, and [[triangulation]] had been used to identify the general location where the accident occurred. The [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] (ONI) then arranged for a spy submarine, the [[USS Halibut (SSGN-587)|USS ''Halibut'']], to search for the missing sub. During the summer of 1968, long cables lowered lights and cameras, and in August found the sub broken into several large pieces. The forward {{convert|200|ft|m|adj=on}} section contained the sub\u2019s three missile launch tubes, one with an apparently intact nuclear-tipped missile.\n\nThere was great interest in attempting a recovery of items such as cipher machines, code manuals, communications equipment, and possibly a torpedo or even a nuclear warhead. Both the Navy and the CIA started plans for a major salvage effort. The Navy proposed cutting into the sub\u2019s hull and recovering whatever items could be reached. In a joint meeting, the Navy presented its recommended plan. They were staggered, however, when Duckett and the CIA team recommended a gigantic effort to recover an entire {{convert|200|ft|m|adj=on}} intact section, raising it the three miles (5&nbsp;km) to the surface.\n\nAfter an intense debate at all levels, Duckett\u2019s proposal was eventually approved by President Richard Nixon. [[Howard Hughes]] agreed for his firm, [[Summa Corporation]], to build a {{convert|618|ft|m|adj=on}} long ship (the [[GSF Explorer|Glomar Explorer]], ostensibly a deep-water, manganese-mining vessel). This had a companion football-field-sized barge (the ''Hughes Marine Barge-1'') that was carried below the ship and thus hidden from overhead observation. Eight giant claws operating from the barge would lift the intact section of the Golf sub from the ocean floor and into an opening on the bottom of the ship. The activity was code-name [[Project Azorian|Project AZORIAN]] (sometimes JENNIFER), and publicly justified as a means of rescuing or recovering future U.S. vessels.<ref>''Opt. Cet.'', Richelson, pp. 133-135</ref>\n\nIt was July 1974 before the ''Glomar'' and the ''Barge'' began the raising attempt. When the section was lifted about {{convert|3000|ft|m}} off the seabed, one of the claws broke, followed by a collapse and shattering of the entire section. All but a small portion \u2013 some 10 percent of the original sub \u2013 fell back to the ocean floor. The lost portions included the items most desired by the intelligence community. Six bodies were in the recovered section, and were given a formal burial at sea.<ref>Sontag, Sherry, and Christopher Drew; ''Blind Man\u2019s Bluff: The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage'', PublicAffairs, 1989</ref>\n\n===Parapsychology intelligence===\n\nIn the early 1970s, two laser scientists at the [[SRI International|Stanford Research Institute]] (SRI) began research in [[parapsychology]]. In a meeting with representatives of the DS&T, they claimed to have found witnesses of Soviet successes in psychokinetics \u2013 use of the mind for moving physical objects \u2013 and had themselves conducted positive research in mentally viewing remote objects and scenes \u2013 [[astral projection]].\n\nThe CIA had long conducted research in the area of behavioral control. Throughout the 1950s and into the 1960s, there was extensive testing of the effects of hypnosis and drugs, particularly [[lysergic acid diethylamide]] (LSD) on human subjects. The bulk of these activities were conducted by the Technical Services Staff, forerunner of the Technical Services Department (TSD). Thus, when the SRI scientists presented their information on mind control, Duckett assigned this to the TSD.\n\nIn October 1972, the TSD initiated the Biofield Measurements Program, to be conducted jointly with SRI, to determine whether participants (the viewers or percipients) could reliably identify and accurately describe salient features of remote locations or targets. This was in part justified by attempts to find what progress the Soviets were making in parapsychology and how it might be used against the United States. Two test subjects (persons claiming paranormal abilities) were provided by the SRI. Early in the following year, reported successes in \"remote viewing\" by the percipients were such that other units of the DS&T joined in the effort. A management review of the program was made in the summer of 1973, and both Duckett and the CIA Executive Director [[William Colby]] allowed the activity to continue.\n\nA carefully planned experiment was conducted in July 1974. Duckett asked that this center on a description made by remote viewing of a target area in the Soviet Union that had been recently imaged by a satellite and suspected to be a nuclear test site. In sessions over a four-day period, the test subjects gave mentally derived descriptions of the site; these descriptions were then independently evaluated by a scientist from the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]  The overall judgement of the evaluator was that the remote viewing appeared to be a failure; nevertheless, continued low-level research in parapsychology intelligence was allowed by Duckett until he retired in June 1976.\n\n==Controversy at the CIA==\n\nDuckett was aware of the ongoing experiments being conducted on U.S. servicemen at [[Edgewood Arsenal human experiments|Edgewood]], in which the CIA had commercial drug manufacturers provide them with samples of drugs rejected for commercial sale in order to study how their \"unfavorable side effects\" would modify behavior.<ref name=\"Washington Post\">{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/26/AR2007062601689.html |title=Experimenting with the Mind|date=2007-06-27}}</ref>  Duckett maintained that the experiments were not being conducted for offensive purposes stating that they were \"defensive, in the sense that we would be able to recognize certain behavior if similar materials were used against Americans.\"  However, in the disclosed CIA [[Family Jewels (Central Intelligence Agency)|Family Jewels]] document, he was on record as saying that he thought \"the Director would be ill-advised to say he is acquainted with this program (meaning [[Edgewood Arsenal human experiments|Edgewood]]).\"<ref name=\"George Washington University Archives\">{{cite web |url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB222/top04.pdf |title=Family Jewels Memorandum|date=1973-05-08}}</ref>\n\n==Post CIA and miscellaneous==\n\nAfter retiring from the CIA in 1976, Carl Duckett joined the firm Intec, Inc., of [[McLean, Virginia]], as Chairman of the Board and President. He had retained top levels of security clearance and, through Intec, provided a number of aerospace industries with consulting services and analytical studies in technical intelligence and electronic warfare. He also served on advisory panels for the Senate Select Committee for Intelligence and the [[President's Intelligence Advisory Board|President\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board]]. Having earlier been divorced, he married Ann Marie Bell in 1978.\n\nIn 1985, Duckett opened an Intec office at Mathews Court House, Virginia, and moved his residence to a bay-side farm near [[Hudgins, Virginia]]. For a period of time, he also served as the Magistrate of [[Mathews County, Virginia]]. He continued working for Intec until early 1992, but died of lung cancer in a medical center at [[Newport News, Virginia]], on April 1, 1992, and was buried in the Gwynn\u2019s Island Cemetery near his farm. He was survived by his wife, Ann Marie, and, from his first marriage, Nannie Jane; two sons, Ernest Pannell (1942) and Arthur Lee (1946); and a daughter, Ruth Eleanor (1948).\n\nIn his professional career, Carl Duckett received the following special awards and decorations:\n* [[Distinguished Intelligence Medal]] (CIA\u2014twice received)\n* [[Commendation Medal]] (U. S. Army)\n* Leadership Award [[National Civil Service Reform League]]\n* George Goddard Award ([[SPIE]], Soc. of  Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engrs.)\n* Control, Communications, and Intelligence Award ([[Association of Old Crows]]).\n\nAs a part of its 50th anniversary celebration in 1997, the Central Intelligence Agency gave Trailblazer Awards to 50 Agency officers, \"from our earliest days to the present, who by their actions, example, innovations, or initiative, have taken the CIA in important new directions and helped shape our history.\" Carl E. Duckett was one of the honored recipients of a Trailblazer Award.\n\n== References ==\n<!--- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== General ===\n* Day, Dwayne A.; ''et al'' (eds.); ''Eye in the Sky: The Story of CORONA Spy Satellites,'' Smithsonian Institution Press, 1998, pp.&nbsp;48\u201385\n* Killian, James R., Jr.; ''Sputniks, Scientists, and Eisenhower'', MIT Press, 1982\n* Kress, Kenneth A.; \"Parapsychology in Intelligence: A Personal Review and Conclusions,\" ''Studies in Intelligence'', vol. 21, no. 4 (Winter 1977) pp.&nbsp;7\u201317\n* Pedlow, Gregory W., and Donald W.

It provided for a [[Victorian Legislative Council]] of 21 elected members and 30 members appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor. This body was given jurisdiction over all but Australian lands and could pass any [[legislation]] not in conflict with the extant [[English Law|English]] laws. The Act  provided that the current arrangements would continue either until a charter of justice were issued, or until legislation was passed by the Victorian Legislative Council.<ref name=\"bennett \u00e0 beckett\">\n{{cite book\n  | last = Bennett\n  | first = J.

Quarton made some remarks which were then followed by Game 1 of the [[1953 World Series]] between the [[1953 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] and [[1953 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Brooklyn Dodgers]]. The station has always been a primary CBS affiliate, but also carried a secondary affiliation with [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]].<ref name=\"Gazette\">{{Cite news| last = | first = | author2-link = | title = World Series Play WMT-TV Channel 2| newspaper = Cedar Rapids Gazette| pages = 18| date = September 28, 1953| url =| postscript = <!--None--> }}</ref>\n\nIt was licensed to serve the Cedar Rapids, Waterloo and [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]] areas making it the first station to be given split-[[media market|market]] status by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC){{fact|date=May 2019}}. It was also the first station to transmit with 100,000 [[watt]]s of power, the maximum power allowed for a low-band television station. Initially, the station was owned by a group consisting of American Broadcasting Stations, Quarton and several others. WMT-TV was sister to [[WMT (AM)|WMT radio]] (600 AM) which had been broadcasting in the area since 1922. The [[call signs in North America|call letters]] stood for the now-defunct '''''W'''aterloo '''M'''orning '''T'''ribune'' which owned WMT radio from 1928 until 1934.\n\nWMT-AM-TV were based at what came to be known as Broadcast Park. When the facility was first built, the surrounding area was still mainly rural. A {{convert|702|ft|m|0|adj=on}} high broadcast tower was built to transmit the signal. This served as the primary tower for the next four years. In 1956, a taller tower in Rowley was built to transmit the signal but a [[windstorm]] on December 10 blew the tower down. This was soon rebuilt and remains in service today. In 1968, the WMT stations (including WMT-FM at 96.5, now [[KKSY-FM]], which signed on in 1963) were sold to the Morton family of [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. The family's holdings eventually became known as Orion Broadcasting.\n\nThe WMT stations remained under Orion's ownership until 1981 when the company merged with Cosmos Broadcasting, a subsidiary of insurance and broadcasting conglomerate [[The Liberty Corporation|Liberty Corporation]]. However, the two companies owned more television stations than the FCC allowed at the time. As a condition of the sale, Cosmos had to sell WMT-TV and found a buyer in [[Guy Gannett Publishing]] of [[Portland, Maine]]. On October 29, 1981, the station changed its callsign to '''KGAN-TV''' (FCC rules at the time prohibited TV and radio stations in the same city, but with different owners from sharing the same call letters, hence the change; the \"-TV\" suffix would later be dropped on September 13, 1984). KGAN, along with most of Guy Gannett's broadcasting holdings, was purchased by the Sinclair Broadcast Group in 1999.\n\nLater that same year, Sinclair announced the sale of KGAN and the [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]]/[[Champaign, Illinois]] duo of [[WICS]] and [[Broadcast relay station#Semi-satellites|semi-satellite]] [[WICD (TV)|WICD]] to Sunrise Television. The FCC, however, did not allow the Sunrise purchase due to the company's ownership structure. A large block of Sunrise stock was owned by the investment firm [[Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst]], which was also majority stockholder of the [[LIN TV Corporation]]. At the time, LIN owned [[WAND]] in [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]], a rival to WICS/WICD. The FCC ruled that HMTF held enough stock in Sunrise that an acquisition of WICS/WICD would have resulted in a [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] between two of the four highest-rated stations in the [[Central Illinois]] market, which is forbidden under current FCC duopoly rules. WICS and WICD simulcast much of the same programming and the two outlet's [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] are combined by [[Nielsen Media Research]] and considered to be a single station for counting purposes. Since KGAN was part of the package deal and would not have been sold to Sunrise without WICS/WICD, the sale fell through and Sinclair retained ownership of all three stations.\n\nOn January 5, 2007, KGAN was pulled from Mediacom systems as part of an ongoing [[Sinclair Broadcast Group#Retransmission disputes|retransmission dispute]] between Mediacom and Sinclair. The move threatened to leave many Eastern Iowa cable viewers without coverage of [[Super Bowl XLI]] until the two sides reached an agreement on February 2 that restored KGAN to Mediacom systems.<ref>{{cite news|first=Shirley|last=Brady|title=Mediacom and Sinclair Make A Deal|work=Cable360|date=February 2, 2007}}</ref> The retransmission agreement expired at the end of 2009 and again Eastern Iowa viewers risked losing [[NFL on CBS|CBS]]' coverage of [[Super Bowl XLIV]]. After a short-term extension to January 8, 2010, Mediacom and Sinclair reached a one-year retransmission agreement on January 7 that ran through the end of the year.<ref>{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Farrell|title=Mediacom Reaches Retrans Agreement With Sinclair|work=Multichannel News|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/442963-Updated_Mediacom_Reaches_Retrans_Agreement_With_Sinclair.php|date=January 7, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2008, Sinclair announced its intent to purchase of KFXA from Second Generation of Iowa. Normally, the FCC's duopoly rules forbid common ownership of two of the four largest stations in a single media market. Sinclair, which had already acquired the non-license assets of KFXA, is expected to seek a \"failing station\" waiver from the FCC to acquire the license. During late-Summer 2008, KGAN filed a lawsuit against the city of Cedar Rapids for failing to give the station full access to e-mail messages related to the [[Iowa Flood of 2008]]. The lawsuit has yet to be decided. On February 17, 2009, its digital signal remained on UHF channel 51 when the [[Digital television transition in the United States|analog to digital conversion]] was completed. It has frequently preempted shows from CBS including [[CBS Kids]] in favor of [[feature film|movies]], [[broadcasting of sports events|sports]], and [[Infomercial|paid programs]]. Today, the station preempts programming from the network in favor of special paid programs such as those from [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]].\n\nAlthough KGAN had been airing network programming in HD for years prior, on October 19, 2011, it updated their local master control system to a fully HD-capable system. This allowed them to air syndicated programming and local advertising in the HD format. As a part of this transition, they moved from [[1080i]] output (which their network programming originates in) to [[720p]], to keep with the rest of the Sinclair Broadcast Group family's HD formatting (as most of the group's \"Big Four\" network affiliates are affiliated with either Fox or [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], both of which broadcast in 720p).\n\nKGAN/KFXA transitioned to a 16:9 SD format for their news operation on April 8, 2012. They debuted a new studio set when their newscasts began HD broadcast on July 30, 2017.\n\n==Digital channels==\nThe station's digital signal is [[multiplex (TV)|multiplexed]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

On the morning of April 5, 2014, the station moved to digital channel 29 and continues to identify as channel 2.1 over-the-air via PSIP.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbs2iowa.com/news/features/channeltwoupgrade/#.UzY750DfJyJ|title=CBS 2 has something important to tell you.

A local broadcast seen weeknights at 10 was added to the schedule in the [[Autumn|Fall]] of that year. It would begin airing a midday show weekdays at noon in late 1956. Early on, the station's weather department was highly revered by Eastern Iowans for many decades under the direction of Conrad Johnson in the 1960s and 1970s. Shortly after his retirement, longtime [[meteorologist]] Dave Towne continued that tradition for another decade. Dave was joined briefly by Andre Bernier who was the weekday morning and noon meteorologist in 1981.\n\nAndre left KGAN in March 1982 when he became part of the launch team for [[The Weather Channel (United States)|The Weather Channel]]. In 1984, Dave Towne brought [[Pulse-Doppler radar|Doppler]] [[weather radar]] to the station and it became the first in the area to utilize the system's images for weathercasts and [[severe weather]] coverage. He took a sabbatical from television to pursue other interests and returned briefly to KGAN on weekends but has since retired from Cedar Rapids television altogether. Tim Heller was another popular weather anchor in the early-1990s who grew up not too far away from Cedar Rapids but left for sunnier weather and a larger market in [[Texas]]. While the station's local radar is still erect, it no longer pulls data from the device.\n\nThe station's news department has won two [[George Foster Peabody]] awards. The first [[Peabody Award]] was in 1956 for its role in developing ''The Secret of Flight'' television programs. These shows, focusing on [[aeronautical]] education, were made possible with the assistance of Doctor [[Alexander Lippisch]] who was the Director of the [[Rockwell Collins|Collins Aeronautical Research Laboratory]]. In 1994, KGAN won another Peabody award for the work [[Investigative journalism|investigative reporter]] Sandy Riesgraf performed in helping to expose a sewer solvent scandal. Compared with the market's other news departments, KGAN traditionally focuses on the greater Cedar Rapids area. Dubuque has coverage provided though bureaus operated by KFXA but ultimately the former captures a majority of the local news demographic in that area.\n\nIt is unknown exactly when KFXA's separate news department in Cedar Rapids was shut down with that outlet's consolidation with KGAN. On March 4, 2001, KGAN began producing a nightly prime time newscast on sister station and fellow Fox affiliate [[KDSM-TV]] in [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]]. Known as ''Fox 17 News at 9'', this half-hour show originated live from KGAN's studios and featured its own on-air personnel. There was regional news coverage and statewide weather forecasts provided since there were no locally based personnel in Des Moines. In 2002 for the convenience of Eastern Iowa viewers, the thirty-minute program was added to KFXA through a simulcast and renamed ''Fox News at 9''. For the most part, the broadcast's format remained the same although Eastern Iowa reports from KGAN reporters were added.\n\nOn September 2, 2008, [[NBC]] affiliate [[WHO-DT]] (owned by [[Local TV LLC|Local TV]]) in Des Moines entered into a news share agreement with KDSM. As a result, the [[Big Three television networks|big three outlet]] began producing a Central Iowa-focused prime time newscast on that station from WHO's studios. Today, KGAN continues to produce an hour-long prime time newscast at 9 seen every night on KFXA. The station did not participate in the wider implementation of Sinclair's now-defunct, controversial ''[[News Central]]'' format for its newscasts but did air \"The Point\" (a one-minute [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Political criticism|political commentary]]) that was also controversial and a requirement of all Sinclair-owned stations with local news until the series was discontinued in December 2006.\n\nIn Fall 2005 despite having no weekday morning show of its own, KGAN began producing ''[[Good Day (disambiguation)#Television|Good Day]] Iowa'' on KFXA. This was seen for two hours from 7 until 9 and competed against national morning shows on Eastern Iowa's big three affiliates. Due to inconsistent viewership and low ratings, the newscast was canceled in July 2007. Due in part to the Iowa flood of 2008 that was still ongoing at the time, KGAN finally debuted a weekday morning newscast of its own called ''CBS 2 This Morning''. To make room for this new program, it moved ''[[The Early Show]]'' to the 7-9 a.m. time slot. On that same day, the station also added a newscast weeknights at 5 before the ''[[CBS Evening News]]''.\n\nOn September 19, 2011, KGAN brought back a weekday morning show to KFXA, adding the ''Fox 28 News at Seven AM'' which is seen for an hour until 8.\n\nWeather forecasts from this station can also heard on [[KCRR]]-FM 97.7, [[KKHQ-FM]] 92.3, [[KOEL-FM]] 98.5 and [[KCJJ]]-AM 1630.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080314182209/http://www.captainerniesshowboat.com/marshalj Legendary WMT kids show host Marshal J Fan Page]\n*KGAN.

It was also the first station to transmit with 100,000 [[watt]]s of power, the maximum power allowed for a low-band television station. Initially, the station was owned by a group consisting of American Broadcasting Stations, Quarton and several others. WMT-TV was sister to [[WMT (AM)|WMT radio]] (600 AM) which had been broadcasting in the area since 1922. The [[call signs in North America|call letters]] stood for the now-defunct '''''W'''aterloo '''M'''orning '''T'''ribune'' which owned WMT radio from 1928 until 1934.\n\nWMT-AM-TV were based at what came to be known as Broadcast Park. When the facility was first built, the surrounding area was still mainly rural. A {{convert|702|ft|m|0|adj=on}} high broadcast tower was built to transmit the signal. This served as the primary tower for the next four years. In 1956, a taller tower in Rowley was built to transmit the signal but a [[windstorm]] on December 10 blew the tower down. This was soon rebuilt and remains in service today. In 1968, the WMT stations (including WMT-FM at 96.5, now [[KKSY-FM]], which signed on in 1963) were sold to the Morton family of [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. The family's holdings eventually became known as Orion Broadcasting.\n\nThe WMT stations remained under Orion's ownership until 1981 when the company merged with Cosmos Broadcasting, a subsidiary of insurance and broadcasting conglomerate [[The Liberty Corporation|Liberty Corporation]]. However, the two companies owned more television stations than the FCC allowed at the time. As a condition of the sale, Cosmos had to sell WMT-TV and found a buyer in [[Guy Gannett Publishing]] of [[Portland, Maine]]. On October 29, 1981, the station changed its callsign to '''KGAN-TV''' (FCC rules at the time prohibited TV and radio stations in the same city, but with different owners from sharing the same call letters, hence the change; the \"-TV\" suffix would later be dropped on September 13, 1984). KGAN, along with most of Guy Gannett's broadcasting holdings, was purchased by the Sinclair Broadcast Group in 1999.\n\nLater that same year, Sinclair announced the sale of KGAN and the [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]]/[[Champaign, Illinois]] duo of [[WICS]] and [[Broadcast relay station#Semi-satellites|semi-satellite]] [[WICD (TV)|WICD]] to Sunrise Television. The FCC, however, did not allow the Sunrise purchase due to the company's ownership structure. A large block of Sunrise stock was owned by the investment firm [[Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst]], which was also majority stockholder of the [[LIN TV Corporation]]. At the time, LIN owned [[WAND]] in [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]], a rival to WICS/WICD. The FCC ruled that HMTF held enough stock in Sunrise that an acquisition of WICS/WICD would have resulted in a [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] between two of the four highest-rated stations in the [[Central Illinois]] market, which is forbidden under current FCC duopoly rules. WICS and WICD simulcast much of the same programming and the two outlet's [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] are combined by [[Nielsen Media Research]] and considered to be a single station for counting purposes. Since KGAN was part of the package deal and would not have been sold to Sunrise without WICS/WICD, the sale fell through and Sinclair retained ownership of all three stations.\n\nOn January 5, 2007, KGAN was pulled from Mediacom systems as part of an ongoing [[Sinclair Broadcast Group#Retransmission disputes|retransmission dispute]] between Mediacom and Sinclair. The move threatened to leave many Eastern Iowa cable viewers without coverage of [[Super Bowl XLI]] until the two sides reached an agreement on February 2 that restored KGAN to Mediacom systems.<ref>{{cite news|first=Shirley|last=Brady|title=Mediacom and Sinclair Make A Deal|work=Cable360|date=February 2, 2007}}</ref> The retransmission agreement expired at the end of 2009 and again Eastern Iowa viewers risked losing [[NFL on CBS|CBS]]' coverage of [[Super Bowl XLIV]]. After a short-term extension to January 8, 2010, Mediacom and Sinclair reached a one-year retransmission agreement on January 7 that ran through the end of the year.<ref>{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Farrell|title=Mediacom Reaches Retrans Agreement With Sinclair|work=Multichannel News|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/442963-Updated_Mediacom_Reaches_Retrans_Agreement_With_Sinclair.php|date=January 7, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2008, Sinclair announced its intent to purchase of KFXA from Second Generation of Iowa. Normally, the FCC's duopoly rules forbid common ownership of two of the four largest stations in a single media market. Sinclair, which had already acquired the non-license assets of KFXA, is expected to seek a \"failing station\" waiver from the FCC to acquire the license. During late-Summer 2008, KGAN filed a lawsuit against the city of Cedar Rapids for failing to give the station full access to e-mail messages related to the [[Iowa Flood of 2008]]. The lawsuit has yet to be decided. On February 17, 2009, its digital signal remained on UHF channel 51 when the [[Digital television transition in the United States|analog to digital conversion]] was completed. It has frequently preempted shows from CBS including [[CBS Kids]] in favor of [[feature film|movies]], [[broadcasting of sports events|sports]], and [[Infomercial|paid programs]]. Today, the station preempts programming from the network in favor of special paid programs such as those from [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]].\n\nAlthough KGAN had been airing network programming in HD for years prior, on October 19, 2011, it updated their local master control system to a fully HD-capable system. This allowed them to air syndicated programming and local advertising in the HD format. As a part of this transition, they moved from [[1080i]] output (which their network programming originates in) to [[720p]], to keep with the rest of the Sinclair Broadcast Group family's HD formatting (as most of the group's \"Big Four\" network affiliates are affiliated with either Fox or [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], both of which broadcast in 720p).\n\nKGAN/KFXA transitioned to a 16:9 SD format for their news operation on April 8, 2012. They debuted a new studio set when their newscasts began HD broadcast on July 30, 2017.\n\n==Digital channels==\nThe station's digital signal is [[multiplex (TV)|multiplexed]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

On the morning of April 5, 2014, the station moved to digital channel 29 and continues to identify as channel 2.1 over-the-air via PSIP.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbs2iowa.com/news/features/channeltwoupgrade/#.UzY750DfJyJ|title=CBS 2 has something important to tell you.

A local broadcast seen weeknights at 10 was added to the schedule in the [[Autumn|Fall]] of that year. It would begin airing a midday show weekdays at noon in late 1956. Early on, the station's weather department was highly revered by Eastern Iowans for many decades under the direction of Conrad Johnson in the 1960s and 1970s. Shortly after his retirement, longtime [[meteorologist]] Dave Towne continued that tradition for another decade. Dave was joined briefly by Andre Bernier who was the weekday morning and noon meteorologist in 1981.\n\nAndre left KGAN in March 1982 when he became part of the launch team for [[The Weather Channel (United States)|The Weather Channel]]. In 1984, Dave Towne brought [[Pulse-Doppler radar|Doppler]] [[weather radar]] to the station and it became the first in the area to utilize the system's images for weathercasts and [[severe weather]] coverage. He took a sabbatical from television to pursue other interests and returned briefly to KGAN on weekends but has since retired from Cedar Rapids television altogether. Tim Heller was another popular weather anchor in the early-1990s who grew up not too far away from Cedar Rapids but left for sunnier weather and a larger market in [[Texas]]. While the station's local radar is still erect, it no longer pulls data from the device.\n\nThe station's news department has won two [[George Foster Peabody]] awards. The first [[Peabody Award]] was in 1956 for its role in developing ''The Secret of Flight'' television programs. These shows, focusing on [[aeronautical]] education, were made possible with the assistance of Doctor [[Alexander Lippisch]] who was the Director of the [[Rockwell Collins|Collins Aeronautical Research Laboratory]]. In 1994, KGAN won another Peabody award for the work [[Investigative journalism|investigative reporter]] Sandy Riesgraf performed in helping to expose a sewer solvent scandal. Compared with the market's other news departments, KGAN traditionally focuses on the greater Cedar Rapids area. Dubuque has coverage provided though bureaus operated by KFXA but ultimately the former captures a majority of the local news demographic in that area.\n\nIt is unknown exactly when KFXA's separate news department in Cedar Rapids was shut down with that outlet's consolidation with KGAN. On March 4, 2001, KGAN began producing a nightly prime time newscast on sister station and fellow Fox affiliate [[KDSM-TV]] in [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]]. Known as ''Fox 17 News at 9'', this half-hour show originated live from KGAN's studios and featured its own on-air personnel. There was regional news coverage and statewide weather forecasts provided since there were no locally based personnel in Des Moines. In 2002 for the convenience of Eastern Iowa viewers, the thirty-minute program was added to KFXA through a simulcast and renamed ''Fox News at 9''. For the most part, the broadcast's format remained the same although Eastern Iowa reports from KGAN reporters were added.\n\nOn September 2, 2008, [[NBC]] affiliate [[WHO-DT]] (owned by [[Local TV LLC|Local TV]]) in Des Moines entered into a news share agreement with KDSM. As a result, the [[Big Three television networks|big three outlet]] began producing a Central Iowa-focused prime time newscast on that station from WHO's studios. Today, KGAN continues to produce an hour-long prime time newscast at 9 seen every night on KFXA. The station did not participate in the wider implementation of Sinclair's now-defunct, controversial ''[[News Central]]'' format for its newscasts but did air \"The Point\" (a one-minute [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Political criticism|political commentary]]) that was also controversial and a requirement of all Sinclair-owned stations with local news until the series was discontinued in December 2006.\n\nIn Fall 2005 despite having no weekday morning show of its own, KGAN began producing ''[[Good Day (disambiguation)#Television|Good Day]] Iowa'' on KFXA. This was seen for two hours from 7 until 9 and competed against national morning shows on Eastern Iowa's big three affiliates. Due to inconsistent viewership and low ratings, the newscast was canceled in July 2007. Due in part to the Iowa flood of 2008 that was still ongoing at the time, KGAN finally debuted a weekday morning newscast of its own called ''CBS 2 This Morning''. To make room for this new program, it moved ''[[The Early Show]]'' to the 7-9 a.m. time slot. On that same day, the station also added a newscast weeknights at 5 before the ''[[CBS Evening News]]''.\n\nOn September 19, 2011, KGAN brought back a weekday morning show to KFXA, adding the ''Fox 28 News at Seven AM'' which is seen for an hour until 8.\n\nWeather forecasts from this station can also heard on [[KCRR]]-FM 97.7, [[KKHQ-FM]] 92.3, [[KOEL-FM]] 98.5 and [[KCJJ]]-AM 1630.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080314182209/http://www.captainerniesshowboat.com/marshalj Legendary WMT kids show host Marshal J Fan Page]\n*KGAN.
