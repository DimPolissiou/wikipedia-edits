''Jalsa'', a Telugu film starring Pawan Kalyan grossed $10 million at the box office. It was the biggest hit of 2008 and the second highest grosser amongst Telugu films. Their next \u2013 ''Ghajini'', a Bollywood movie starring Aamir Khan grossed over $45 million at box office, making it the highest grossing Indian film. The smashing blockbuster ''[[Magadheera]]'', a big-budget swords and sandal epic that grossed $25 million at the box office. The movie was not only the highest-grossing Telugu film ever, but the highest grossing Indian movie in 2009. The movie is a crown jewel in Telugu cinema for two reasons. ''Magadheera'' unlocked the box office potential of Telugu films by doing numbers that only a few big-budget Bollywood blockbusters can match. Secondly, with its Hollywoodesque grandeur, special effects and action episodes it showed the Telugu cinema can churn out films of international standards.\n\n===Geetha Arts===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#b0c4de;\"| Year\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#b0c4de;\"| Film\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#b0c4de;\"| Language\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#b0c4de;\"| Director\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#b0c4de;\"| Notes\n\n|-\n|| 1974 || ''[[Bantrotu Bharya]]'' || [[Telugu language|Telugu]] || [[Dasari Narayana Rao]] || Produced as '''Geetha Art Productions'''\n|-\n|| 1975 || ''Devude Digivaste'' ||[[Telugu language|Telugu]]|| Dasari Narayana Rao || Produced as '''Geetha Art Productions'''\n|-\n|| 1979 || ''Maavullo Mahasivudu'' ||[[Telugu language|Telugu]]||Raja Chandra || Produced as '''Geetha Cine Enterprises'''\n|-\n|| 1982 || ''[[Yamakinkarudu]]'' ||[[Telugu language|Telugu]]|| Raj Bharat || Produced as '''Geetha Creative Arts'''\n|-\n|| 1984 || ''[[Hero (1984 film)|Hero]]'' || [[Telugu language|Telugu]] || [[Vijaya Bapineedu]] ||\n|-\n|| 1985 || ''[[Vijetha]]'' ||[[Telugu language|Telugu]]|| [[A.

''Jalsa'', a Telugu film starring Pawan Kalyan grossed $10 million at the box office. It was the biggest hit of 2008 and the second highest grosser amongst Telugu films. Their next \u2013 ''Ghajini'', a Bollywood movie starring Aamir Khan grossed over $45 million at box office, making it the highest grossing Indian film. The smashing blockbuster ''[[Magadheera]]'', a big-budget swords and sandal epic that grossed $25 million at the box office. The movie was not only the highest-grossing Telugu film ever, but the highest grossing Indian movie in 2009. The movie is a crown jewel in Telugu cinema for two reasons. ''Magadheera'' unlocked the box office potential of Telugu films by doing numbers that only a few big-budget Bollywood blockbusters can match. Secondly, with its Hollywoodesque grandeur, special effects and action episodes it showed the Telugu cinema can churn out films of international standards.\n\n===Geetha Arts===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#b0c4de;\"| Year\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#b0c4de;\"| Film\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#b0c4de;\"| Language\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#b0c4de;\"| Director\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#b0c4de;\"| Notes\n\n|-\n|| 1974 || ''[[Bantrotu Bharya]]'' || [[Telugu language|Telugu]] || [[Dasari Narayana Rao]] || Produced as '''Geetha Art Productions'''\n|-\n|| 1975 || ''Devude Digivaste'' ||[[Telugu language|Telugu]]|| Dasari Narayana Rao || Produced as '''Geetha Art Productions'''\n|-\n|| 1979 || ''Maavullo Mahasivudu'' ||[[Telugu language|Telugu]]||Raja Chandra || Produced as '''Geetha Cine Enterprises'''\n|-\n|| 1982 || ''[[Yamakinkarudu]]'' ||[[Telugu language|Telugu]]|| Raj Bharat || Produced as '''Geetha Creative Arts'''\n|-\n|| 1984 || ''[[Hero (1984 film)|Hero]]'' || [[Telugu language|Telugu]] || [[Vijaya Bapineedu]] ||\n|-\n|| 1985 || ''[[Vijetha]]'' ||[[Telugu language|Telugu]]|| [[A.

of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC), and [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission|Chairman]] of the [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] (CMC). Xi has been the [[paramount leader]], the [[Orders of precedence in China|highest-ranking]] official in China, since 2012 and he officially received the title of \"[[leadership core]]\" from the CPC in 2016. Xi has also been a member of the 17th, 18th, 19th [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|CPC Politburo Standing Committee]] since 2007.\n\nThe son of Chinese Communist veteran [[Xi Zhongxun]], he was exiled to rural [[Yanchuan County]] as a teenager following his father's purge during the [[Cultural Revolution]], and lived in a cave in the village of Liangjiahe, where he worked as the party secretary. After studying [[chemical engineering]] at the [[Tsinghua University]] as a \"[[Worker-Peasant-Soldier student]]\", Xi rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. Xi was governor of [[Fujian]] from 1999 to 2002. He was also governor, then [[Party Committee Secretary|party secretary]] of neighbouring [[Zhejiang]] from 2002 to 2007. Following the dismissal of the party secretary of Shanghai [[Chen Liangyu]], Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He joined the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]] and [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|central secretariat]] in October 2007, spending the next five years as Chinese paramount leader [[Hu Jintao|Hu Jintao's]] presumed [[Succession of power in the People's Republic of China|successor]]. Xi was [[Vice President of the People's Republic of China|vice president]] from 2008 to 2013 and [[Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] from 2010 to 2012.\n\nXi is the first [[List of general secretaries and chairmen of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] born after the [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|establishment]] of the People's Republic of China. Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-corruption campaign]] has led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired Communist Party officials, including members of the Politburo Standing Committee. He has also enacted or promoted more assertive foreign policy, particularly with regard to [[China\u2013Japan relations]], [[Territorial disputes in the South China Sea|China's claims]] in the [[South China Sea Islands|South China Sea]], and its advocacy for [[free trade]] and [[globalization]].

However, Xi and his colleagues acknowledge the challenges to the legitimacy of Communist rule, particularly corruption by party officials. The answer, according to Xi's programme, is two-fold: strengthen the party from within, by streamlining strict party discipline and initiating a large anti-corruption campaign to remove unsavoury elements from within the party, and re-instituting the Mass Line Campaign externally to make party officials better understand and serve the needs of ordinary people. Xi believes that, just as the party must be at the apex of political control of the state, the party's central authorities (i.e., the Politburo, PSC, or himself as general secretary) must exercise

(PRC), and [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission|Chairman]] of the [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] (CMC). Xi has been the [[paramount leader]], the [[Orders of precedence in China|highest-ranking]] official in China, since 2012 and he officially received the title of \"[[leadership core]]\" from the CPC in 2016. Xi has also been a member of the 17th, 18th, 19th [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|CPC Politburo Standing Committee]] since 2007.\n\nThe son of Chinese Communist veteran [[Xi Zhongxun]], he was exiled to rural [[Yanchuan County]] as a teenager following his father's purge during the [[Cultural Revolution]], and lived in a cave in the village of Liangjiahe, where he worked as the party secretary. After studying [[chemical engineering]] at the [[Tsinghua University]] as a \"[[Worker-Peasant-Soldier student]]\", Xi rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. Xi was governor of [[Fujian]] from 1999 to 2002. He was also governor, then [[Party Committee Secretary|party secretary]] of neighbouring [[Zhejiang]] from 2002 to 2007. Following the dismissal of the party secretary of Shanghai [[Chen Liangyu]], Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He joined the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]] and [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|central secretariat]] in October 2007, spending the next five years as Chinese paramount leader [[Hu Jintao|Hu Jintao's]] presumed [[Succession of power in the People's Republic of China|successor]].

Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-corruption campaign]] has led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired Communist Party officials, including members of the Politburo Standing Committee. He has also enacted or promoted more assertive foreign policy, particularly with regard to [[China\u2013Japan relations]], [[Territorial disputes in the South China Sea|China's claims]] in the [[South China Sea Islands|South China Sea]], and its advocacy for [[free trade]] and [[globalization]].

However, Xi and his colleagues acknowledge the challenges to the legitimacy of Communist rule, particularly corruption by party officials. The answer, according to Xi's programme, is two-fold: strengthen the party from within, by streamlining strict party discipline and initiating a large anti-corruption campaign to remove unsavoury elements from within the party, and re-instituting the Mass Line Campaign externally to make party officials better understand and serve the needs of ordinary people. Xi believes that, just as the party must be at the apex of political control of the state, the party's central authorities (i.e., the Politburo, PSC, or himself as general secretary) must exercise

Instead, Cessna intended them to be inexpensive to purchase and operate.<ref name=Foster1992/>\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Cessna 402B..., Tridente AN0974089.jpg|thumb|Cabin]]\n\nThe Cessna 401 and 402 were developed to be non-pressurized twin engine piston aircraft.  Their goal was to be a workhorse, useful to  cargo and small commuter airlines among other users.\n\nThe Cessna 401 and 402 were developments of the [[Cessna 411]].<ref name=\"Plane and Pilot 1977\"/>  One goal for the Cessna 401/402 was to improve upon the very bad single engine handling of the Cessna 411.<ref name=\"Used-Guide\"/>  Another goal was to avoid using the somewhat expensive and maintenance prone geared engines of the Cessna 411.<ref name=\"Used-Guide\"/>\n\nCessna 401s and 402s are powered by {{convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[turbocharged]] [[Teledyne Continental Motors|Continental]] engines with three-bladed, [[constant speed propeller|constant speed]], fully feathering propellers. On later models cruise power was limited to 75% to reduce cabin noise. Some aircraft have a [[Propeller synchronization|propeller synchrophaser]] to reduce cabin noise and vibration.<ref name=\"Plane and Pilot 1977\"/>\n\nThe FAA granted certification to the Cessna 401 in October 1968 and the 402 in January 1969.<ref name=twinandturbine23Sep2015>{{cite magazine |url= http://twinandturbine.com/article/cessna-402-cabin-class-twin/ |title= The Cessna 402: A Versatile Cabin-Class Twin |magazine= Twin and Turbine |author= Leroy Cook |date= Sep 23, 2015}}</ref>\nThe original Cessna 402 was introduced in 1967.  A version without the large cargo door called the Cessna 401 was produced at the same time.<ref name=\"Used-Guide\"/>\nIn 1969, the 402's nose was stretched for added baggage space.  This model was renamed the 402A.  The 401 kept the original nose.<ref name=\"Used-Guide\"/>\nIn 1970, various minor changes were made.  Also, optional larger (184 gallon) fuel tanks became available.  This model was called the 402B.<ref name=\"Used-Guide\"/>\nBy 1971, sales of the 401 had slowed to only 21 planes, so the model was discontinued.<ref name=\"Used-Guide\"/>\n\nBetween 1971 and 1977, many changes were made to the airframe, including an optional engine fire extinguisher (1971), simpler exhaust system (1972), enlarged passenger windows (1973), equipment for flight into known icing conditions (1975), and an optional flushing toilet (1977).<ref name=\"Used-Guide\"/>\nIn 1976, the very similar [[Cessna 421]] was produced with a new wing, no tip tanks, and a simpler fuel system.  The [[Cessna 414]] was given a clean wing in 1978.\n\nIn 1979, the 402s received a new wing, with a five-foot greater span. The landing gear was replaced, using the simpler system from the [[Cessna 414]].  The landing gear track was also increased by four feet.  The engines\u2019 output was boosted to 325&nbsp;hp each and max gross weight increased to 6,850 pounds, creating a much more useful airplane. Fuel capacity was increased to 213 gallons.  Even with the weight increase, single-engine performance went up and the stall speed went down by a couple of knots.  After this change, the plane was named the Cessna 402C.<ref name=twinandturbine23Sep2015/><ref name=\"Used-Guide\"/>\nProduction stopped after the 1985 model year.\n\n===Modifications===\nIn 1969, [[American Jet Industries]] began work on a turboprop-powered conversion of the Cessna 402, named the '''Turbo Star 402''', using [[Allison 250|Allison 250-B17]] engines.<ref name=JAWA1977>{{cite book |title=Jane's All the World's Aircraft 1977\u201378 |publisher=Jane's Yearbooks |location=London |page= 398}}</ref> The prototype flew on 10 June 1970.<ref name=JAWA1977/> Further modifications providing increased fuel capacity, higher gross weight, and lower minimum control speed were carried out in 1974 and the modification was re-certified.<ref name=JAWA1977/> [[Scenic Airlines]] of [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] purchased rights to the design in 1977.<ref>{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Michael J.

Their goal was to be a workhorse, useful to  cargo and small commuter airlines among other users.\n\nThe Cessna 401 and 402 were developments of the [[Cessna 411]].<ref name=\"Plane and Pilot 1977\"/>  One goal for the Cessna 401/402 was to improve upon the very bad single engine handling of the Cessna 411.<ref name=\"Used-Guide\"/>  Another goal was to avoid using the somewhat expensive and maintenance prone geared engines of the Cessna 411.<ref name=\"Used-Guide\"/>\n\nCessna 401s and 402s are powered by {{convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[turbocharged]] [[Teledyne Continental Motors|Continental]] engines with three-bladed, [[constant speed propeller|constant speed]], fully feathering propellers. On later models cruise power was limited to 75% to reduce cabin noise. Some aircraft have a [[Propeller synchronization|propeller synchrophaser]] to reduce cabin noise and vibration.<ref name=\"Plane and Pilot 1977\"/>\n\nThe FAA granted certification to the Cessna 401 in October 1968 and the 402 in January 1969.<ref name=twinandturbine23Sep2015>{{cite magazine |url= http://twinandturbine.com/article/cessna-402-cabin-class-twin/ |title= The Cessna 402: A Versatile Cabin-Class Twin |magazine= Twin and Turbine |author= Leroy Cook |date= Sep 23, 2015}}</ref>\nThe original Cessna 402 was introduced in 1967.  A version without the large cargo door called the Cessna 401 was produced at the same time.<ref name=\"Used-Guide\"/>\nIn 1969, the 402's nose was stretched for added baggage space.  This model was renamed the 402A.  The 401 kept the original nose.<ref name=\"Used-Guide\"/>\nIn 1970, various minor changes were made.  Also, optional larger (184 gallon) fuel tanks became available.  This model was called the 402B.<ref name=\"Used-Guide\"/>\nBy 1971, sales of the 401 had slowed to only 21 planes, so the model was discontinued.<ref name=\"Used-Guide\"/>\n\nBetween 1971 and 1977, many changes were made to the airframe, including an optional engine fire extinguisher (1971), simpler exhaust system (1972), enlarged passenger windows (1973), equipment for flight into known icing conditions (1975), and an optional flushing toilet (1977).<ref name=\"Used-Guide\"/>\nIn 1976, the very similar [[Cessna 421]] was produced with a new wing, no tip tanks, and a simpler fuel system.  The [[Cessna 414]] was given a clean wing in 1978.\n\nIn 1979, the 402s received a new wing, with a five-foot greater span. The landing gear was replaced, using the simpler system from the [[Cessna 414]].  The landing gear track was also increased by four feet.  The engines\u2019 output was boosted to 325&nbsp;hp each and max gross weight increased to 6,850 pounds, creating a much more useful airplane. Fuel capacity was increased to 213 gallons.  Even with the weight increase, single-engine performance went up and the stall speed went down by a couple of knots.  After this change, the plane was named the Cessna 402C.<ref name=twinandturbine23Sep2015/><ref name=\"Used-Guide\"/>\nProduction stopped after the 1985 model year.\n\n===Modifications===\nIn 1969, [[American Jet Industries]] began work on a turboprop-powered conversion of the Cessna 402, named the '''Turbo Star 402''', using [[Allison 250|Allison 250-B17]] engines.<ref name=JAWA1977>{{cite book |title=Jane's All the World's Aircraft 1977\u201378 |publisher=Jane's Yearbooks |location=London |page= 398}}</ref> The prototype flew on 10 June 1970.<ref name=JAWA1977/> Further modifications providing increased fuel capacity, higher gross weight, and lower minimum control speed were carried out in 1974 and the modification was re-certified.<ref name=JAWA1977/> [[Scenic Airlines]] of [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] purchased rights to the design in 1977.<ref>{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Michael J.

{"title_page": "Weed control", "text_new": "{{farming}}\n{{more citations needed|date=February 2014}}\n'''Weed control''' is the botanical component of [[pest control]], which attempts to stop [[weed]]s, especially [[noxious weed]]s, from competing with desired flora and fauna including [[domesticate]]d [[plant]]s and [[livestock]], and in natural settings preventing non native species competing with native species.\n\nWeed control is important in [[agriculture]]. Methods include hand cultivation with [[hoe (tool)|hoes]], powered cultivation with [[cultivator]]s, smothering with [[mulch]], lethal [[wilting]] with high heat, [[burn]]ing, and chemical control with [[herbicide]]s (weed killers).\n\n== Need for control ==\nWeeds compete with productive crops or pasture, they can be poisonous, distasteful, produce burrs, thorns or otherwise interfere with the use and management of desirable plants by contaminating harvests or interfering with livestock.\n\nWeeds compete with crops for space, [[nutrient]]s, water and light. Smaller, slower growing seedlings are more susceptible than those that are larger and more vigorous. [[Onion]]s are one of the most vulnerable, because they are slow to germinate and produce slender, upright stems{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. By contrast [[broad beans]] produce large seedlings and suffer far fewer effects other than during periods of water shortage at the crucial time when the pods are filling out{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. Transplanted crops raised in sterile soil or potting [[compost]] gain a head start over germinating weeds.\n\nWeeds also vary in their competitive abilities according to conditions and season. Tall-growing vigorous weeds such as [[Chenopodium album|fat hen]] (''Chenopodium album'') can have the most pronounced effects on adjacent crops, although seedlings of fat hen that appear in late summer produce only small plants. [[Stellaria media|Chickweed]] (''Stellaria media''), a low growing plant, can happily co-exist with a tall crop during the summer, but plants that have overwintered will grow rapidly in early spring and may swamp crops such as onions or spring greens.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe presence of weeds does not necessarily mean that they are damaging a crop, especially during the early growth stages when both weeds and crops can grow without interference. However, as growth proceeds they each begin to require greater amounts of water and nutrients. Estimates suggest that weed and crop can co-exist harmoniously for around three weeks before competition becomes significant. One study found that after competition had started, the final yield of onion bulbs was reduced at almost 4% per day.<ref name=\"BleasdaleJohn)1991\">{{cite book|first1=J. K. A. |last1=Bleasdale|last2=Salter |first2=Peter John | title=The Complete Know and Grow Vegetables|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sk0sAAAACAAJ|date=1 January 1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-286114-6}}</ref>\n\n[[Perennial plant|Perennial]] weeds with [[bulbil]]s, such as [[lesser celandine]] and [[oxalis]], or with persistent underground stems such as [[Elymus repens|couch grass]] (''Agropyron repens'') or [[creeping buttercup]] (''Ranunculus repens'') store reserves of food, and are thus able to persist in drought or through winter. Some perennials such as couch grass exude [[allelopathic]] chemicals that inhibit the growth of other nearby plants.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nWeeds can also host pests and diseases that can spread to cultivated crops. [[Charlock]] and [[Shepherd's purse]] may carry [[clubroot]], [[nematode|eelworm]] can be harboured by chickweed, fat hen and shepherd's purse, while the [[cucumber mosaic virus]], which can devastate the [[Cucurbitaceae|cucurbit family]], is carried by a range of different weeds including chickweed and groundsel.\n\nPests such as [[cutworm]]s may first attack weeds but then move on to cultivated crops.\n\nSome plants are considered weeds by some farmers and crops by others. [[Charlock]], a common weed in the southeastern [[United States|US]], are weeds according to row crop growers, but are valued by [[beekeeper]]s, who seek out places where it blooms all winter, thus providing pollen for [[honeybee]]s and other [[pollinator]]s. Its bloom resists all but a very hard freeze, and recovers once the freeze ends.\n\n== Weed propagation ==\n=== Seeds ===\n[[Annual plant|Annual]] and [[biennial plant|biennial]] weeds such as [[chickweed]], annual meadow grass, [[shepherd's purse]], [[Senecio vulgaris|groundsel]], [[Chenopodium album|fat hen]], [[Galium aparine|cleaver]], [[Veronica (plant)|speedwell]] and [[hairy bittercress]] [[plant propagation|propagate]] themselves by [[seed]]ing. Many produce huge numbers of seed several times a season, some all year round. Groundsel can produce 1000 seed, and can continue right through a mild winter, whilst [[Scentless Mayweed]] produces over 30,000 seeds per plant. Not all of these will [[germinate]] at once, but over several seasons, lying dormant in the soil sometimes for years until exposed to light. [[Poppy (flower)|Poppy]] seed can survive 80\u2013100 years, [[Dock (plant)|dock]] 50 or more. There can be many thousands of seeds in a square foot or square metre of ground, thus any soil disturbance will produce a flush of fresh weed seedlings.\n\n=== Subsurface/surface ===\nThe most persistent perennials spread by underground creeping [[rhizome]]s that can regrow from a tiny fragment. These include [[Elymus repens|couch grass]], [[bindweed]], [[ground elder]], [[Urtica|nettles]], rosebay willow herb, [[Japanese knotweed]], [[horsetail]] and [[bracken]], as well as [[creeping thistle]], whose tap roots can put out lateral roots. Other perennials put out runners that spread along the [[soil]] surface. As they creep they set down roots, enabling them to colonise bare ground with great rapidity. These include creeping [[buttercup]] and [[ground ivy]]. Yet another group of perennials propagate by [[stolon]]s- stems that arch back into the ground to reroot. The most familiar of these is the [[bramble]].\n\n== Methods ==\nWeed control plans typically consist of many methods which are divided into biological, chemical, cultural, and physical/mechanical control.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/pests-weeds-diseases/control-methods|title=Control methods|publisher=Department of Agriculture and Food, Government of Western Australia|accessdate=11 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Speicherkoog Kartoffelacker Abflammger\u00e4t Envo-Dan.jpg|thumb|Pesticide-free thermic weed control with a weed burner on a potato field in [[Dithmarschen]], Germany]]\n\n===Physical/mechanical methods===\n==== Coverings ====\nIn domestic gardens, methods of weed control include covering an area of ground with a material that creates a hostile environment for weed growth, known as a ''weed mat''.\n\nSeveral layers of wet [[newspaper]] prevent light from reaching plants beneath, which kills them.\n\nIn the case of black plastic, the [[greenhouse effect]] kills the plants. Although the black plastic sheet is effective at preventing weeds that it covers, it is difficult to achieve complete coverage.

Nettle infestations can be tackled by cutting back at least three times a year, repeated over a three-year period.

The goal of flame weeding is not necessarily burning the plant, but rather causing a lethal [[wilting]] by [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturing proteins]] in the weed. Similarly, hot air weeders can heat up the seeds to the point of destroying them.  Flame weeders can be combined with techniques such as stale seedbeds (preparing and watering the seedbed early, then killing the nascent crop of weeds that springs up from it, then sowing the crop seeds) and pre-emergence flaming (doing a flame pass against weed seedlings after the sowing of the crop seeds but before those seedlings emerge from the soil\u2014a span of time that can be days or weeks).\n\nHot foam (foamstream) causes the cell walls to rupture, killing the plant. Weed burners heat up soil quickly and destroy superficial parts of the plants. Weed seeds are often heat resistant and even react with an increase of growth on dry heat.\n\nSince the 19th century [[soil steam sterilization]] has been used to clean weeds completely from soil. Several research results confirm the high effectiveness of humid heat against weeds and its seeds.<ref>Research report of DLR Rheinlandpfalz, September 2010: [http://www.soil-steaming-steam-boiler-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/steaming-research-results_dlr2010.pdf ''Weed control in seed cultures, especially arugula], Author: Dr. Norbert Laun, Institute \"Queckbrunnerhof\", Schifferstadt (Germany).

Planted grass tends to have a higher heat/humidity tolerance than unwanted weeds.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n==== Seed targeting ====\nIn 1998, the Australian Herbicide Resistance Initiative (AHRI), debuted. gathered fifteen scientists and technical staff members to conduct field surveys, collect seeds, test for resistance and study the biochemical and genetic mechanisms of resistance. A collaboration with [[DuPont]] led to a mandatory herbicide labeling program, in which each mode of action is clearly identified by a letter of the alphabet.<ref name=s1408/>\n\nThe key innovation of the AHRI approach has been to focus on weed seeds. Ryegrass seeds last only a few years in soil, so if farmers can prevent new seeds from arriving, the number of sprouts will shrink each year. Until the new approach farmers were unintentionally helping the seeds. Their combines loosen ryegrass seeds from their stalks and spread them over the fields. In the mid-1980s, a few farmers hitched covered trailers, called \"chaff carts\", behind their combines to catch the chaff and weed seeds. The collected material is then burned.<ref name=s1408/>\n\nAn alternative is to concentrate the seeds into a half-meter-wide strip called a [[windrow]] and burn the windrows after the harvest, destroying the seeds. Since 2003, windrow burning has been adopted by about 70% of farmers in Western Australia.<ref name=s1408/>\n\nYet another approach is the Harrington Seed Destructor, which is an adaptation of a coal pulverizing cage mill that uses steel bars whirling at up to 1500 rpm. It keeps all the organic material in the field and does not involve combustion, but kills 95% of seeds.<ref name=s1408/>\n\n===Cultural methods===\n==== Stale seed bed ====\nAnother manual technique is the \u2018[[stale seed bed]]\u2019, which involves cultivating the soil, then leaving it fallow for a week or so. When the initial weeds sprout, the grower lightly [[Hoe (tool)|hoes]] them away before planting the desired crop. However, even a freshly cleared bed is susceptible to airborne seed from elsewhere, as well as seed carried by passing animals on their fur, or from imported [[manure]].\n\n==== Buried drip irrigation ====\n[[Drip irrigation|Buried drip irrigation]] involves burying drip tape in the subsurface near the planting bed, thereby limiting weeds access to water while also allowing crops to obtain moisture. It is most effective during dry periods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anrcatalog.ucanr.edu/pdf/7250.pdf|title=Weed Management for Organic Crops|author=Richard Smith, W.

Typically a combination of methods are used to achieve satisfactory control.\n\n[[Sulfur]] in some circumstances is accepted within British [[Soil Association]] standards.\n\n==== Herbicides ====\nThe above described methods of weed control use no or very limited chemical inputs. They are preferred by [[Organic gardening|organic gardeners]] or [[Organic farming|organic farmers]].\n\nHowever weed control can also be achieved by the use of herbicides. Selective herbicides kill certain targets while leaving the desired crop relatively unharmed. Some of these act by interfering with the growth of the weed and are often based on plant [[hormone]]s. Herbicides are generally classified as follows:\n\n* '''Contact''' herbicides destroy only plant tissue that contacts the herbicide. Generally, these are the fastest-acting herbicides. They are ineffective on perennial plants that can re-grow from roots or [[tuber]]s.\n* '''Systemic''' herbicides are foliar-applied and move through the plant where they destroy a greater amount of tissue. [[Glyphosate]] is currently the most used systemic herbicide.\n* '''Soil-borne''' herbicides are applied to the soil and are taken up by the roots of the target plant.\n* '''[[Preemergent herbicides|Pre-emergent]]''' herbicides are applied to the soil and prevent germination or early growth of weed seeds.\n\nIn [[agriculture]] large scale and systematic procedures are usually required, often by machines, such as large liquid herbicide 'floater' sprayers, or [[aerial application]].\n\n=== Bradley method ===\nSee also [[Bradley method of bush regeneration|Bradley Method of Bush Regeneration]], which uses ecological processes to do much of the work.\n[[Perennial plant|Perennial]] weeds also propagate by seeding; the airborne seed of the [[dandelion]] and the [[epilobium|rose-bay willow herb]] parachute far and wide. Dandelion and dock also put down deep [[tap root]]s, which, although they do not spread underground, are able to regrow from any remaining piece left in the ground.\n\n=== Hybrid ===\nOne method of maintaining the effectiveness of individual strategies is to combine them with others that work in complete different ways. Thus seed targeting has been combined with herbicides. In Australia seed management has been effectively combined with [[trifluralin]] and clethodim.<ref name=s1408/>\n\n== Resistance ==\nResistance occurs when a target adapts to circumvent a particular control strategy. It affects not only weed control,but antibiotics, insect control and other domains. In agriculture is mostly considered in reference to pesticides, but can defeat other strategies, e.g., when a target species becomes more drought tolerant via selection pressure.\n\n=== Farming practices ===\nHerbicide resistance recently became a critical problem as many Australian sheep farmers switched to exclusively growing wheat in their pastures in the 1970s.  In wheat fields, introduced varieties of [[ryegrass]], while good for grazing sheep, are intense competitors with wheat. Ryegrasses produce so many seeds that, if left unchecked, they can completely choke a field. Herbicides provided excellent control, while reducing soil disrupting because of less need to plough. Within little more than a decade, ryegrass and other weeds began to develop resistance. Australian farmers evolved again and began diversifying their techniques.<ref name=s1408>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.341.6147.734| title = The War Against Weeds Down Under| journal = Science| volume = 341| issue = 6147| pages = 734\u2013736| year = 2013| last1 = Stokstad | first1 = E.| pmid=23950526| bibcode = 2013Sci...341..734S}}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, patches of ryegrass had become immune to Hoegrass, a family of herbicides that inhibit an enzyme called [[acetyl coenzyme A]] [[carboxylase]].<ref name=s1408/>\n\nRyegrass populations were large, and had substantial genetic diversity, because farmers had planted many varieties. Ryegrass is cross-pollinated by wind, so genes shuffle frequently. Farmers sprayed inexpensive Hoegrass year after year, creating selection pressure, but were diluting the herbicide in order to save money, increasing plants survival. Hoegrass was mostly replaced by a group of herbicides that block [[acetolactate synthase]], again helped by poor application practices. Ryegrass evolved a kind of \"cross-resistance\" that allowed it to rapidly break down a variety of herbicides. Australian farmers lost four classes of herbicides in only a few years. As of 2013 only two herbicide classes, called [[Photosystem II]] and [[long-chain fatty acid]] inhibitors, had become the last hope.<ref name=s1408/>\n\n== Strategic Weed Management ==\nStrategic weed management is a process of managing weeds at a district, regional or national scale.\nIn Australia the first published weed management strategies were developed in Tasmania,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/21506651|title=Weedplan, putting the pieces together : a Tasmanian weed management strategy / issued by the Ministerial Working Group for the Development of the Tasmanian Weed Management Strategy - Details|website=Trove|language=en|access-date=2018-09-11}}</ref> New South Wales<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/28981627|title=New South Wales weeds strategy : coordinating the fight|last=(N.S.W.)|first=Noxious Weeds Advisory Committee|date=1997|publisher=[Orange, N.S.W.] : NSW Agriculture|language=English}}</ref> and South Australian 1999,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/34186375|title=A weed strategy for South Australia|last=Committee|first=South Australia Weed Strategy|last2=Australia|first2=Natural Resources Council of South|date=1999|publisher=[Adelaide : Natural Resources Council of South Australia]|language=English}}</ref> followed by the National Weeds Strategy in 1999.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The national weeds strategy : a strategic approach to weed problems of national significance|date=1997|publisher=[publisher not identified]|others=Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand., Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council.|isbn=0642214018|location=[Commonwealth of Australia]|oclc=37565115}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.agriculture.gov.au/pests-diseases-weeds/pest-animals-and-weeds/review-aus-pest-animal-weed-strategy/aus-weeds-strategy|title=Australian Weeds Strategy|last=|first=|date=|website=Australian Weeds Strategy|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nInternationally weed societies help link weed science and management.

Methods include hand cultivation with [[hoe (tool)|hoes]], powered cultivation with [[cultivator]]s, smothering with [[mulch]], lethal [[wilting]] with high heat, [[burn]]ing, and chemical control with [[herbicide]]s (weed killers).\n\n== Need for control ==\nWeeds compete with productive crops or pasture, they can be poisonous, distasteful, produce burrs, thorns or otherwise interfere with the use and management of desirable plants by contaminating harvests or interfering with livestock.\n\nWeeds compete with crops for space, [[nutrient]]s, water and light. Smaller, slower growing seedlings are more susceptible than those that are larger and more vigorous. [[Onion]]s are one of the most vulnerable, because they are slow to germinate and produce slender, upright stems{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. By contrast [[broad beans]] produce large seedlings and suffer far fewer effects other than during periods of water shortage at the crucial time when the pods are filling out{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. Transplanted crops raised in sterile soil or potting [[compost]] gain a head start over germinating weeds.\n\nWeeds also vary in their competitive abilities according to conditions and season. Tall-growing vigorous weeds such as [[Chenopodium album|fat hen]] (''Chenopodium album'') can have the most pronounced effects on adjacent crops, although seedlings of fat hen that appear in late summer produce only small plants. [[Stellaria media|Chickweed]] (''Stellaria media''), a low growing plant, can happily co-exist with a tall crop during the summer, but plants that have overwintered will grow rapidly in early spring and may swamp crops such as onions or spring greens.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe presence of weeds does not necessarily mean that they are damaging a crop, especially during the early growth stages when both weeds and crops can grow without interference. However, as growth proceeds they each begin to require greater amounts of water and nutrients. Estimates suggest that weed and crop can co-exist harmoniously for around three weeks before competition becomes significant. One study found that after competition had started, the final yield of onion bulbs was reduced at almost 4% per day.<ref name=\"BleasdaleJohn)1991\">{{cite book|first1=J. K.

Some perennials such as couch grass exude [[allelopathic]] chemicals that inhibit the growth of other nearby plants.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nWeeds can also host pests and diseases that can spread to cultivated crops. [[Charlock]] and [[Shepherd's purse]] may carry [[clubroot]], [[nematode|eelworm]] can be harboured by chickweed, fat hen and shepherd's purse, while the [[cucumber mosaic virus]], which can devastate the [[Cucurbitaceae|cucurbit family]], is carried by a range of different weeds including chickweed and groundsel.\n\nPests such as [[cutworm]]s may first attack weeds but then move on to cultivated crops.\n\nSome plants are considered weeds by some farmers and crops by others. [[Charlock]], a common weed in the southeastern [[United States|US]], are weeds according to row crop growers, but are valued by [[beekeeper]]s, who seek out places where it blooms all winter, thus providing pollen for [[honeybee]]s and other [[pollinator]]s. Its bloom resists all but a very hard freeze, and recovers once the freeze ends.\n\n== Weed propagation ==\n=== Seeds ===\n[[Annual plant|Annual]] and [[biennial plant|biennial]] weeds such as [[chickweed]], annual meadow grass, [[shepherd's purse]], [[Senecio vulgaris|groundsel]], [[Chenopodium album|fat hen]], [[Galium aparine|cleaver]], [[Veronica (plant)|speedwell]] and [[hairy bittercress]] [[plant propagation|propagate]] themselves by [[seed]]ing. Many produce huge numbers of seed several times a season, some all year round. Groundsel can produce 1000 seed, and can continue right through a mild winter, whilst [[Scentless Mayweed]] produces over 30,000 seeds per plant. Not all of these will [[germinate]] at once, but over several seasons, lying dormant in the soil sometimes for years until exposed to light. [[Poppy (flower)|Poppy]] seed can survive 80\u2013100 years, [[Dock (plant)|dock]] 50 or more.

Until the new approach farmers were unintentionally helping the seeds. Their combines loosen ryegrass seeds from their stalks and spread them over the fields. In the mid-1980s, a few farmers hitched covered trailers, called \"chaff carts\", behind their combines to catch the chaff and weed seeds. The collected material is then burned.<ref name=s1408/>\n\nAn alternative is to concentrate the seeds into a half-meter-wide strip called a [[windrow]] and burn the windrows after the harvest, destroying the seeds. Since 2003, windrow burning has been adopted by about 70% of farmers in Western Australia.<ref name=s1408/>\n\nYet another approach is the Harrington Seed Destructor, which is an adaptation of a coal pulverizing cage mill that uses steel bars whirling at up to 1500 rpm. It keeps all the organic material in the field and does not involve combustion, but kills 95% of seeds.<ref name=s1408/>\n\n===Cultural methods===\n==== Stale seed bed ====\nAnother manual technique is the \u2018[[stale seed bed]]\u2019, which involves cultivating the soil, then leaving it fallow for a week or so. When the initial weeds sprout, the grower lightly [[Hoe (tool)|hoes]] them away before planting the desired crop. However, even a freshly cleared bed is susceptible to airborne seed from elsewhere, as well as seed carried by passing animals on their fur, or from imported [[manure]].\n\n==== Buried drip irrigation ====\n[[Drip irrigation|Buried drip irrigation]] involves burying drip tape in the subsurface near the planting bed, thereby limiting weeds access to water while also allowing crops to obtain moisture. It is most effective during dry periods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anrcatalog.ucanr.edu/pdf/7250.pdf|title=Weed Management for Organic Crops|author=Richard Smith, W.

Typically a combination of methods are used to achieve satisfactory control.\n\n[[Sulfur]] in some circumstances is accepted within British [[Soil Association]] standards.\n\n==== Herbicides ====\nThe above described methods of weed control use no or very limited chemical inputs. They are preferred by [[Organic gardening|organic gardeners]] or [[Organic farming|organic farmers]].\n\nHowever weed control can also be achieved by the use of herbicides. Selective herbicides kill certain targets while leaving the desired crop relatively unharmed. Some of these act by interfering with the growth of the weed and are often based on plant [[hormone]]s. Herbicides are generally classified as follows:\n\n* '''Contact''' herbicides destroy only plant tissue that contacts the herbicide. Generally, these are the fastest-acting herbicides. They are ineffective on perennial plants that can re-grow from roots or [[tuber]]s.\n* '''Systemic''' herbicides are foliar-applied and move through the plant where they destroy a greater amount of tissue. [[Glyphosate]] is currently the most used systemic herbicide.\n* '''Soil-borne''' herbicides are applied to the soil and are taken up by the roots of the target plant.\n* '''[[Preemergent herbicides|Pre-emergent]]''' herbicides are applied to the soil and prevent germination or early growth of weed seeds.\n\nIn [[agriculture]] large scale and systematic procedures are usually required, often by machines, such as large liquid herbicide 'floater' sprayers, or [[aerial application]].\n\n=== Bradley method ===\nSee also [[Bradley method of bush regeneration|Bradley Method of Bush Regeneration]], which uses ecological processes to do much of the work.\n[[Perennial plant|Perennial]] weeds also propagate by seeding; the airborne seed of the [[dandelion]] and the [[epilobium|rose-bay willow herb]] parachute far and wide. Dandelion and dock also put down deep [[tap root]]s, which, although they do not spread underground, are able to regrow from any remaining piece left in the ground.\n\n=== Hybrid ===\nOne method of maintaining the effectiveness of individual strategies is to combine them with others that work in complete different ways. Thus seed targeting has been combined with herbicides. In Australia seed management has been effectively combined with [[trifluralin]] and clethodim.<ref name=s1408/>\n\n== Resistance ==\nResistance occurs when a target adapts to circumvent a particular control strategy. It affects not only weed control,but antibiotics, insect control and other domains. In agriculture is mostly considered in reference to pesticides, but can defeat other strategies, e.g., when a target species becomes more drought tolerant via selection pressure.\n\n=== Farming practices ===\nHerbicide resistance recently became a critical problem as many Australian sheep farmers switched to exclusively growing wheat in their pastures in the 1970s.  In wheat fields, introduced varieties of [[ryegrass]], while good for grazing sheep, are intense competitors with wheat. Ryegrasses produce so many seeds that, if left unchecked, they can completely choke a field. Herbicides provided excellent control, while reducing soil disrupting because of less need to plough. Within little more than a decade, ryegrass and other weeds began to develop resistance. Australian farmers evolved again and began diversifying their techniques.<ref name=s1408>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.341.6147.734| title = The War Against Weeds Down Under| journal = Science| volume = 341| issue = 6147| pages = 734\u2013736| year = 2013| last1 = Stokstad | first1 = E.| pmid=23950526| bibcode = 2013Sci...341..734S}}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, patches of ryegrass had become immune to Hoegrass, a family of herbicides that inhibit an enzyme called [[acetyl coenzyme A]] [[carboxylase]].<ref name=s1408/>\n\nRyegrass populations were large, and had substantial genetic diversity, because farmers had planted many varieties. Ryegrass is cross-pollinated by wind, so genes shuffle frequently. Farmers sprayed inexpensive Hoegrass year after year, creating selection pressure, but were diluting the herbicide in order to save money, increasing plants survival. Hoegrass was mostly replaced by a group of herbicides that block [[acetolactate synthase]], again helped by poor application practices. Ryegrass evolved a kind of \"cross-resistance\" that allowed it to rapidly break down a variety of herbicides. Australian farmers lost four classes of herbicides in only a few years. As of 2013 only two herbicide classes, called [[Photosystem II]] and [[long-chain fatty acid]] inhibitors, had become the last hope.<ref name=s1408/>\n\n== Strategic Weed Management ==\nStrategic weed management is a process of managing weeds at a district, regional or national scale.\nIn Australia the first published weed management strategies were developed in Tasmania,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/21506651|title=Weedplan, putting the pieces together : a Tasmanian weed management strategy / issued by the Ministerial Working Group for the Development of the Tasmanian Weed Management Strategy - Details|website=Trove|language=en|access-date=2018-09-11}}</ref> New South Wales<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/28981627|title=New South Wales weeds strategy : coordinating the fight|last=(N.S.W.)|first=Noxious Weeds Advisory Committee|date=1997|publisher=[Orange, N.S.W.] : NSW Agriculture|language=English}}</ref> and South Australian 1999,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/34186375|title=A weed strategy for South Australia|last=Committee|first=South Australia Weed Strategy|last2=Australia|first2=Natural Resources Council of South|date=1999|publisher=[Adelaide : Natural Resources Council of South Australia]|language=English}}</ref> followed by the National Weeds Strategy in 1999.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The national weeds strategy : a strategic approach to weed problems of national significance|date=1997|publisher=[publisher not identified]|others=Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand., Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council.|isbn=0642214018|location=[Commonwealth of Australia]|oclc=37565115}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.agriculture.gov.au/pests-diseases-weeds/pest-animals-and-weeds/review-aus-pest-animal-weed-strategy/aus-weeds-strategy|title=Australian Weeds Strategy|last=|first=|date=|website=Australian Weeds Strategy|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nInternationally weed societies help link weed science and management.
