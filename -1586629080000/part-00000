It is one of the leading universities in the country and referred in the Philippines as one of the \"Big 4 Universities\"<ref> http://www.philstar.com/campus/2014/05/26/1327524/university-rankings-find-out-how-your-school-does Archived 2017-07-03 at the Wayback Machine top</ref> together with [[University of the Philippines Diliman]], [[De La Salle University]], and [[University of Santo Tomas]]. Founded in 1859 by the [[Society of Jesus]], Ateneo is the third-oldest university in the Philippines. \n\nAteneo offers elementary and junior high school education exclusively to male students, while its senior high school and college are co-educational. In college, both undergraduate and graduate programs are organized into four schools, collectively known as the [[Loyola Schools]], which are located at its main campus at Loyola Heights along with the Grade School, Junior High School and Senior High School. Four professional schools occupy other campuses throughout [[Metro Manila]]. Students of Ateneo are often referred to as Ateneans ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''mga Atenista'').\n\nAteneo undergraduates follow a [[Catholic]]-rooted [[liberal arts]] curriculum, known as the \"core curriculum\", throughout their program in the Humanities, Social Sciences, Science and Engineering, or Business Management. The world-affirming nature of Ignatian spirituality has translated over the years into the primacy of the liberal arts in Jesuit education that is found in the core curriculum. It is the hallmark of Ateneo education that has been formally in place since the 1950s.<ref>https://www.ateneo.edu/ls/undergraduate/academics/core-curriculum</ref>\n<!-- ==Summary history==\n===1859 to 1959===\nWhile Jesuit teaching efforts in Manila date back to 1595, the Ateneo de Manila University traces its founding to 1859 when the Jesuits, at the behest of the Governor-General, took charge of the Municipal School of Manila, a small school for the children of Spanish residents. In 1865 when it became accredited as a secondary school its name was changed to \"Ateneo Municipal de Manila\". It began offering the bachelor's degree, as well as courses leading to certificates in agriculture, surveying, and business. When Americans occupied the Philippines in the early 1900s, its subsidy from the city was withdrawn. The Jesuits removed the word \"Municipal\" from the school\u2019s name and it became simply Ateneo de Manila. In 1908, the American colonial government licensed Ateneo's bachelor degree and certificates in various disciplines. The Ateneo campus housed other Jesuit institutions of research and learning such as the Manila Observatory and San Jose Major Seminary.\n[[File:Heritage Bells.jpg|150px|right|]]\nAmerican Jesuits replaced their Spanish brethren in 1912. In 1932 the original campus at Intramuros in the heart of old Manila was destroyed by fire and Ateneo moved to the San Jose Major Seminary grounds in [[Padre Faura]], [[Ermita, Manila|Ermita]]. Again during [[World War II]] the Ateneo campus was devastated. Ateneo reopened temporarily in Plaza Guipit in Sampaloc, Manila. The Padre Faura campus reopened in 1946 with [[Quonset hut]]s serving as buildings among the campus ruins.<ref name=\"reyes\">Soledad S.

The Padre Faura campus continued to house the professional schools until 1976. Francisco Araneta was appointed as the Ateneo de Manila's first Filipino Rector in 1958. In 1959, its centennial year, Ateneo became a university.\n\n===1960 to 2015===\nOn September 25, 1969, Pacifico Ortiz was installed as the first Filipino President of the Ateneo de Manila University.<ref name=\"guidon1\">''The Guidon'' October 2004</ref> At this time the Graduate School split into the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and what would become the Graduate School of Business.

Two weeks later, Ateneans joined thousands of [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] from all walks of life in the peaceful uprising at EDSA which ousted Ferdinand Marcos.\nThe Ateneo college opened its doors to its first female students in 1973. The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences moved to Loyola Heights in 1976, and the Padre Faura campus finally closed in 1977 as the Graduate School of Business and the Law School moved to H.V. de la Costa St. in Salcedo Village, Makati. In February 1978, Ateneo opened what would become the Ateneo Computer Technology Center. \n[[File:Science Education Complex.jpg|thumb|Science Education Complex]]\nIn 1991 the School of Law became the first Philippine law school to confer the [[Juris Doctor]] degree. The Ateneo School of Government was established in 1996 and in 1998 Ateneo's Rockwell campus, which would house the Ateneo Graduate School of Business, Ateneo Law School, and Ateneo School of Government, was completed in Rockwell Center in Bel-Air, Makati. Also, the Science Education Complex was completed in the Loyola Heights campus.<br>\nIn 2000, the School of Arts and Sciences which included the College and the Graduate School was restructured into four [[Loyola Schools]]: the School of Humanities, the John Gokongwei School of Management, the School of Science and Engineering, and the School of Social Sciences. In April 2002, the office of the university president established Pathways to Higher Education-Philippines, one of the university's outreach initiatives, with the help of the Ford and Synergeia Foundations. In July 2002 the university [[Church of the Ges\u00f9 (Philippines)|Church of the Ges\u00f9]] was completed in the Loyola Heights campus.

de Manila;'' [[Spanish language|Spanish]]:'' Universidad Ateneo de Manila''), also known simply as the '''Ateneo de Manila''' or '''Ateneo''' and abbreviated as '''AdMU''', is a private [[Catholic]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] research university in [[Quezon City]], [[Philippines]]. It is is one of the leading universities in the country and referred in the Philippines as one of the \"Big 4 Universities\"<ref> http://www.philstar.com/campus/2014/05/26/1327524/university-rankings-find-out-how-your-school-does Archived 2017-07-03 at the Wayback Machine top</ref> together with [[University of the Philippines Diliman]], [[De La Salle University]], and [[University of Santo Tomas]]. Founded in 1859 by the [[Society of Jesus]], Ateneo is the third-oldest university in the Philippines. \n\nAteneo offers elementary and junior high school education exclusively to male students, while its senior high school and college are co-educational. In college, both undergraduate and graduate programs are organized into four schools, collectively known as the [[Loyola Schools]], which are located at its main campus at Loyola Heights along with the Grade School, Junior High School and Senior High School. Four professional schools occupy other campuses throughout [[Metro Manila]]. Students of Ateneo are often referred to as Ateneans ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''mga Atenista'').\n\nAteneo undergraduates follow a [[Catholic]]-rooted [[liberal arts]] curriculum, known as the \"core curriculum\", throughout their program in the Humanities, Social Sciences, Science and Engineering, or Business Management. The world-affirming nature of Ignatian spirituality has translated over the years into the primacy of the liberal arts in Jesuit education that is found in the core curriculum. It is the hallmark of Ateneo education that has been formally in place since the 1950s.<ref>https://www.ateneo.edu/ls/undergraduate/academics/core-curriculum</ref>\n<!-- ==Summary history==\n===1859 to 1959===\nWhile Jesuit teaching efforts in Manila date back to 1595, the Ateneo de Manila University traces its founding to 1859 when the Jesuits, at the behest of the Governor-General, took charge of the Municipal School of Manila, a small school for the children of Spanish residents. In 1865 when it became accredited as a secondary school its name was changed to \"Ateneo Municipal de Manila\". It began offering the bachelor's degree, as well as courses leading to certificates in agriculture, surveying, and business. When Americans occupied the Philippines in the early 1900s, its subsidy from the city was withdrawn. The Jesuits removed the word \"Municipal\" from the school\u2019s name and it became simply Ateneo de Manila. In 1908, the American colonial government licensed Ateneo's bachelor degree and certificates in various disciplines. The Ateneo campus housed other Jesuit institutions of research and learning such as the Manila Observatory and San Jose Major Seminary.\n[[File:Heritage Bells.jpg|150px|right|]]\nAmerican Jesuits replaced their Spanish brethren in 1912. In 1932 the original campus at Intramuros in the heart of old Manila was destroyed by fire and Ateneo moved to the San Jose Major Seminary grounds in [[Padre Faura]], [[Ermita, Manila|Ermita]]. Again during [[World War II]] the Ateneo campus was devastated. Ateneo reopened temporarily in Plaza Guipit in Sampaloc, Manila. The Padre Faura campus reopened in 1946 with [[Quonset hut]]s serving as buildings among the campus ruins.<ref name=\"reyes\">Soledad S.

The Padre Faura campus continued to house the professional schools until 1976. Francisco Araneta was appointed as the Ateneo de Manila's first Filipino Rector in 1958. In 1959, its centennial year, Ateneo became a university.\n\n===1960 to 2015===\nOn September 25, 1969, Pacifico Ortiz was installed as the first Filipino President of the Ateneo de Manila University.<ref name=\"guidon1\">''The Guidon'' October 2004</ref> At this time the Graduate School split into the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and what would become the Graduate School of Business.

Two weeks later, Ateneans joined thousands of [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] from all walks of life in the peaceful uprising at EDSA which ousted Ferdinand Marcos.\nThe Ateneo college opened its doors to its first female students in 1973. The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences moved to Loyola Heights in 1976, and the Padre Faura campus finally closed in 1977 as the Graduate School of Business and the Law School moved to H.V. de la Costa St. in Salcedo Village, Makati. In February 1978, Ateneo opened what would become the Ateneo Computer Technology Center. \n[[File:Science Education Complex.jpg|thumb|Science Education Complex]]\nIn 1991 the School of Law became the first Philippine law school to confer the [[Juris Doctor]] degree. The Ateneo School of Government was established in 1996 and in 1998 Ateneo's Rockwell campus, which would house the Ateneo Graduate School of Business, Ateneo Law School, and Ateneo School of Government, was completed in Rockwell Center in Bel-Air, Makati. Also, the Science Education Complex was completed in the Loyola Heights campus.<br>\nIn 2000, the School of Arts and Sciences which included the College and the Graduate School was restructured into four [[Loyola Schools]]: the School of Humanities, the John Gokongwei School of Management, the School of Science and Engineering, and the School of Social Sciences.

He also held the distinction of being the oldest player ever to appear in both the [[Football records in Italy#Appearances|Serie A]] and the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]].\n\nDuring 15 [[Serie A]] seasons, Ballotta appeared in 138 games for six clubs, mainly [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]].\n\n==Football career==\n\n===The first years===\nBorn in [[Casalecchio di Reno]], [[Emilia Romagna]], Ballotta emerged through [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]]'s youth system before starting out as a senior with hometown club [[A.C. Boca San Lazzaro|Boca San Lazzaro]]. In the 1984 summer he joined [[Modena F.C.|Modena]], where he remained for the next six years. In January 1991 he transferred to [[A.C. Cesena|Cesena]], but only stayed for six months before being purchased by [[Parma A.C.|Parma]] also in [[Serie A]].\n\nBallotta was in top form during [[1992\u201393 Serie A|1992\u201393]], as Parma [[1992\u201393 European Cup Winners' Cup|won]] the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]]<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ECWC/news/Kind=8192/newsId=3445.html Parma outgun brave Antwerp] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219045525/http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ECWC/news/Kind%3D8192/newsId%3D3445.html |date=19 December 2005 }}; UEFA.com, 17 August 2001</ref> and finished third in the league. However, his momentum did not continue into [[1993\u201394 Serie A|the next season]] and he only made three league appearances. He did start both legs in the team's [[1993 European Super Cup|2\u20131 aggregate win]] over [[A.C. Milan]] in the [[UEFA Super Cup]],<ref>[http://www.footballsite.co.uk/Statistics/European/SuperCup/SuperCup1993-94.htm European Super Cup 1993/94]; at Footballsite</ref> but was benched in favor of [[Luca Bucci]] for the [[1993\u201394 European Cup Winners' Cup|1993\u201394 Cup Winners' Cup]], as Parma reached the [[1994 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|final]] for the second consecutive year, only to be defeated by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ECWC/news/Kind=8192/newsId=3436.html Arsenal frustrate Parma's \"double hopes\"]; UEFA.com, 17 August 2001</ref>\n\n===Rise to success===\nBallotta signed with [[Brescia Calcio|Brescia]] in 1994, being relegated in [[1994\u201395 Serie A|his sole season]]. He then spent [[1995\u201396 Serie B|the following campaign]] in [[Serie B]] with [[A.C. Reggiana|Reggiana]], achieving promotion at the first attempt. After [[1996\u201397 Serie A|being immediately relegated]], he left for [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] for [[1997\u201398 Serie A|1997\u201398]], initially as third-choice.\n\nAfter three seasons with the ''Biancocelesti'', Ballotta enjoyed a brief stint with [[Inter Milan]], who acquired the player as part of [[Angelo Peruzzi]]'s multi-billion [[Italian lire|lire]] move to Inter. Inter claimed the transfer fee for Ballotta and Peruzzi were 7&nbsp;billion and 40&nbsp;billion respectively (thus 33&nbsp;billion plus Ballotta),<ref>{{cite report|title=F.C.

Despite a fourth-place finish, they were promoted in place of [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]] after the latter were demoted to [[Serie C1]] following a match-fixing scandal, and he was once again back in the top level after rejoining Lazio as a replacement for [[Fabrizio Casazza]] as third goalkeeper.\n\n===Winning records and retirement===\n[[File:Marco Ballotta.JPG|thumb|200px|Ballotta with Lazio in 2007]]\n\nBallotta made eight starts during the [[2005\u201306 Serie A|2005\u201306 campaign]], as an injury replacement for both Peruzzi and [[Matteo Sereni]]. On 23 October 2005, he set the record as the oldest player to have played in the first division when he started in Lazio's lineup against [[A.S.

Please include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid overlinking.

{"title_page": "Foreign relations of Bolivia", "text_new": "{{Short description|Overview of relations}}{{Politics of Bolivia}}\n[[Bolivia]] traditionally has maintained normal [[diplomatic relations]] with all [[Americas|hemispheric states]] except [[Chile]]. Foreign relations are handled by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Bolivia)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], headed by the [[Chancellor of Bolivia]], [[Fernando Huanacuni Mamani]], the successor of [[David Choquehuanca|David Choquehuanca C\u00e9spedes]].\n\n==Overview==\nRelations with Chile, strained since Bolivia's defeat in the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879\u201383) and its loss of the coastal province of [[Atacama]], were severed from 1962 to 1975 in a dispute over the use of the waters of the [[Lauca River]]. Relations were resumed in 1975 but broken again in 1978 over the inability of the two countries to reach an agreement that solved the [[Atacama border dispute]], that might have granted Bolivia a sovereign access to the sea. In the 1960s, relations with [[Cuba]] were broken by the Bolivian dictatorship following [[Fidel Castro|Castro]]'s rise to power but resumed under the [[V\u00edctor Paz Estenssoro|Paz Estenssoro]] Administration in 1985, which was elected through democratic elections.\n\nBolivia pursues a [[foreign policy]] with a heavy [[Economic policy|economic component]]. Bolivia has become more active in the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), the [[Rio Group]], and in [[MERCOSUR]], with which it signed an association agreement in 1996. Bolivia promotes its policies on [[sustainable development]] and the empowerment of [[indigenous people]].\n\nBolivia is a member of the [[United Nations]] and some of its specialized agencies and related programs; [[Organization of American States|OAS]]; [[Andean Community]]; [[INTELSAT]]; [[Non-Aligned Movement]]; [[International Parliamentary Union]]; [[Latin American Integration Association]] [[ALADI]]; [[World Trade Organization]]; [[Rio Treaty]]; [[Rio Group]]; [[MERCOSUR]]; and [[Uruguay]], [[Paraguay]], [[Bolivia]] ([[:es:URUPABOL|URUPABOL]], restarted in 1993). As an outgrowth of the 1994 [[Summit of the Americas]], Bolivia hosted a hemispheric summit conference on sustainable development in December 1996. A First Ladies' hemispheric summit was also hosted by Bolivia that same month.\n\nBolivia is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]] with{{clarify|date=July 2013|reason=\"with\" implies membership of the ICC includes the US bilateral agreement, but this does not appear to be the case; rewordings solicited to clarify this for the reader, maybe two separate sentences?}} a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the United States-military (as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]]).{{clarify|date=July 2013|reason=Article 98 pipes to [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] which tells the reader nothing}}\n\nThe GeGaLo Index of gains and losses after energy transition ranks Bolivia 128th out of 156 countries.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Overland|first=Indra|last2=Bazilian|first2=Morgan|last3=Ilimbek Uulu|first3=Talgat|last4=Vakulchuk|first4=Roman|last5=Westphal|first5=Kirsten|date=2019-11-01|title=The GeGaLo index: Geopolitical gains and losses after energy transition|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211467X19300999|journal=Energy Strategy Reviews|language=en|volume=26|pages=100406|doi=10.1016/j.esr.2019.100406|issn=2211-467X}}</ref> It is thus among the countries that will lose strength on the international stage if a global transition to renewable energy is carried out and there is no longer demand for Bolivian oil and gas.<ref name=\":02\" /> It is estimated to experience the third largest loss of all Latin American countries (after Colombia and Venezuela).\n\n==United Nations involvement==\n{{Expand section|date=November 2008}}\nBolivia has frequently been involved with the [[United Nations]]. In November 2008, the Bolivian contingent of [[United Nations peacekeeping|UN peacekeeping]] troops with the [[United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] was relocated to safety, as at least one other regional state was also reviewing its own mission's security.

In March 2004, Mesa announced that the government would stage a series of public rallies across the country and in Bolivian embassies abroad in remembrance of those who died in the [[War of the Pacific]], and to call for Chile to grant Bolivia a seacoast. Mesa made this demand a cornerstone of his administration's policy.\n\nThe incumbent president seeking reelection for a fourth term, maintains a hard position on this issue of which the symbolic importance is underlined by the fact that Bolivia also still has a navy, despite it not currently having access to the sea. In October 2018, the ICJ (International Court of Justice), ruled against Bolivia in a case that would determine whether or not Bolivia could force Chile to negotiate access to the sea. However, the ICJ did state that cooperation was desirable if workable solutions are to be found.\n\n==Illicit drugs==\nBolivia is the world's third-largest cultivator of [[coca]] (after [[Peru]] and [[Colombia]]) with an estimated 218&nbsp;km\u00b2 under cultivation in 1999, a 45% decrease in overall cultivation of coca from 1998 levels; intermediate coca products and [[cocaine]] exported to or through Colombia, Brazil, [[Argentina]], and [[Chile]] to the United States and other international drug markets; alternative crop program aims to reduce illicit coca cultivation.\n\n==Bilateral relations==\n===Africa===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:12%;\"| Formal Relations Began\n!Notes\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Egypt}}||<!--Date started-->||\n\n* Bolivia has an embassy in [[Cairo]].\n* Egypt has an embassy in [[La Paz]].\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Equatorial Guinea}}||<!--Date started-->||\n\nIn November 2017, President [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo]] paid an official visit to Bolivia becoming the first African head-of-state to ever visit Bolivia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cancilleria.gob.bo/webmre/node/2341|title=Presidente de Guinea Ecuatorial realiza Visita Oficial a Bolivia &#124; MINISTERIO DE RELACIONES EXTERIORES|website=cancilleria.gob.bo}}</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|South Africa}}||<!--Date started-->||See [[Bolivia\u2013South Africa relations]]\n\n* Bolivia maintains an honorary consulate in [[Johannesburg]].\n* South Africa is accredited to Bolivia from its embassy in Lima, Peru.\n|}\n\n===Americas===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:12%;\"| Formal Relations Began\n!Notes\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Argentina}}||<!--Date started-->||See [[Argentina\u2013Bolivia relations]]\n\n* Argentina has an embassy in La Paz and a consulate-general in [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]] and consulates in [[Tarija, Bolivia|Tarija]], [[Cochabamba]], [[Villaz\u00f3n]] and [[Yacuiba]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ebolv.cancilleria.gob.ar/|title=Embajada en Bolivia|website=ebolv.cancilleria.gob.ar}}</ref>\n* Bolivia has an embassy in [[Buenos Aires]] and consulates in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]], [[San Salvador de Jujuy|Jujuy]], [[La Quiaca]], [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]], [[Or\u00e1n, Salta|Or\u00e1n]], [[Pocito Department|Pocito]], [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]], [[Salta]] and [[Viedma, R\u00edo Negro|Viedma]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.embajadadebolivia.com.ar/|title=Embajada de Bolivia en la Argentina|website=Embajada de Bolivia en Argentina|access-date=2019-12-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190502201009/http://embajadadebolivia.com.ar/|archive-date=2019-05-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Belize}}||<!--Date started-->1 October 1987||\n*Both countries established diplomatic relations on October 1, 1987.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.bz/images/documents/DIPLOMATIC%20RELATIONS.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230194831/http://www.mfa.gov.bz/images/documents/DIPLOMATIC%20RELATIONS.pdf |archive-date=2017-12-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> \n*Both countries are full members of [[Organization of American States]].\n\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Brazil}}||<!--Date started-->||\n\nBrazil and Bolivia have been working on expanding and [[international trade|diversifying trade]] between the two countries in the last quarter of 2008.

In 1991 the United States forgave more than US$350 million owed by Bolivia to the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] and the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]. Presently, the United States leads an international contingent pressuring Bolivia to curb its [[illegal drug trade]].\n\nThe election of [[Evo Morales]] strained relations between the two countries.  Morales rose to power as the head of a [[trade union]] of [[coca]] growers.

The team identified [[spontaneous fission]] activity contained within a volatile chloride portraying eka-hafnium properties.

In particular they pointed out that the Russian group had altered the details of their claims several times over a period of 20 years, a fact that the Russian team does not deny. They also stressed that the TWG had given too much credence to the chemistry experiments performed by the Russians and accused the TWG of not having appropriately qualified personnel on the committee. The TWG responded by saying that this was not the case and having assessed each point raised by the American group said that they found no reason to alter their conclusion regarding priority of discovery.<ref>{{cite journal |doi =10.1351/pac199365081815|title =Responses on 'Discovery of the transfermium elements' by Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, California; Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Dubna; and Gesellschaft fur Schwerionenforschung, Darmstadt followed by reply to responses by the Transfermium Working Group |year =1993|last1= Ghiorso|first1=A. |last2=Seaborg |first2=G.

Since the Soviets claimed to have first detected the new element they suggested the name ''kurchatovium'' (Ku) in honor of [[Igor Kurchatov]] (1903\u20131960), former head of [[Soviet nuclear research]]. This name had been used in books of the [[Soviet Bloc]] as the official name of the element. The Americans, however, proposed ''rutherfordium'' (Rf) for the new element to honor [[Ernest Rutherford, 1st Baron Rutherford of Nelson|Ernest Rutherford]], who is known as the \"father\" of [[nuclear physics]]. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ([[IUPAC]]) adopted ''unnilquadium'' (Unq) as a temporary, [[systematic element name]], derived from the Latin names for digits 1, 0, and 4. In 1994, IUPAC suggested the name ''dubnium'' (Db) to be used since ''rutherfordium'' was suggested for element 106 and IUPAC felt that the Dubna team should be recognized for their contributions. However, there was still a dispute over the names of elements 104\u2013107. In 1997 the teams involved resolved the dispute and adopted the current name ''rutherfordium''. The name ''[[dubnium]]'' was given to element 105 at the same time.<ref name=97IUPAC/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Isotopes==\n<div style=\"float:right; margin:1em; font-size:85%;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Isotope half-lives and discovery years\n!

Therefore, it was concluded that rutherfordium's basic properties will resemble those of other [[group 4 element]]s, below [[titanium]], [[zirconium]], and hafnium.<ref name=Rf263/><ref name=\"Kratz03\" /> Some of its properties were determined by gas-phase experiments and aqueous chemistry. The oxidation state +4 is the only stable state for the latter two elements and therefore rutherfordium should also exhibit a stable +4 state.<ref name=\"Kratz03\" /> In addition, rutherfordium is also expected to be able to form a less stable +3 state.<ref name=Haire/> The [[standard reduction potential]] of the Rf<sup>4+</sup>/Rf couple is predicted to be higher than \u22121.7&nbsp;V.<ref name=BFricke/>\n\nInitial predictions of the chemical properties of rutherfordium were based on calculations which indicated that the relativistic effects on the electron shell might be strong enough that the [[p orbital|7p orbitals]] would have a lower energy level than the [[d orbital|6d orbitals]], giving it a [[valence electron]] configuration of 6d<sup>1</sup> 7s<sup>2</sup> 7p<sup>1</sup> or even 7s<sup>2</sup> 7p<sup>2</sup>, therefore making the element behave more like [[lead]] than hafnium. With better calculation methods and experimental studies of the chemical properties of rutherfordium compounds it could be shown that this does not happen and that rutherfordium instead behaves like the rest of the [[group 4 element]]s.<ref name=Haire/><ref name=\"Kratz03\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1351/pac200375010103 |url=http://stage.iupac.org/originalWeb/publications/pac/2003/pdf/7501x0103.pdf |title=Critical evaluation of the chemical properties of the transactinide elements (IUPAC Technical Report) |date=2003 |last1=Kratz |first1=J.

It reacts with halogens to form tetrahalides, RfX<sub>4</sub>, which hydrolyze on contact with water to form oxyhalides RfOX<sub>2</sub>. The tetrahalides are volatile solids existing as monomeric tetrahedral molecules in the vapor phase.<ref name=\"Kratz03\"/>\n\nIn the aqueous phase, the Rf<sup>4+</sup> ion hydrolyzes less than titanium(IV) and to a similar extent as zirconium and hafnium, thus resulting in the RfO<sup>2+</sup> ion. Treatment of the halides with halide ions promotes the formation of complex ions. The use of chloride and bromide ions produces the hexahalide complexes {{chem|RfCl|6|2-}} and {{chem|RfBr|6|2-}}.

Thus, for the larger rutherfordium ion, the complexes {{chem|RfF|6|2-}}, {{chem|RfF|7|3-}} and {{chem|RfF|8|4-}} are possible.<ref name=\"Kratz03\"/>\n\n===Physical and atomic===\nRutherfordium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a [[hexagonal close-packed]] crystal structure (<sup>''c''</sup>/<sub>''a''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.61), similar to its lighter [[congener (chemistry)|congener]] hafnium.<ref name=hcp/> It should be a very heavy metal with a [[density]] of around 23.2&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>; in comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, [[osmium]], has a density of 22.61&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>. This results from rutherfordium's high atomic weight, the [[lanthanide contraction|lanthanide and actinide contractions]], and [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]], although production of enough rutherfordium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay. The atomic radius for rutherfordium is expected to be around 150&nbsp;[[picometer|pm]]. Due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital, the Rf<sup>+</sup> and Rf<sup>2+</sup> ions are predicted to give up 6d electrons instead of 7s electrons, which is the opposite of the behavior of its lighter homologues.<ref name=Haire/> When under high pressure (variously calculated as 72 or ~50 [[gigapascal|GPa]]), rutherfordium is expected to transition to a [[body-centered cubic]] crystal structure; hafnium transforms to this structure at 71\u00b11&nbsp;GPa, but has an intermediate \u03c9 structure that it transforms to at 38\u00b18&nbsp;GPa that is lacking for rutherfordium.<ref>{{Cite document |arxiv = 1106.3146|last1 = Gyanchandani|first1 = Jyoti|title = Structural Properties of Group IV B Element Rutherfordium by First Principles Theory|last2 = Sikka|first2 = S.

Since the Soviets claimed to have first detected the new element they suggested the name ''kurchatovium'' (Ku) in honor of [[Igor Kurchatov]] (1903\u20131960), former head of [[Soviet nuclear research]]. This name had been used in books of the [[Soviet Bloc]] as the official name of the element. The Americans, however, proposed ''rutherfordium'' (Rf) for the new element to honor [[Ernest Rutherford, 1st Baron Rutherford of Nelson|Ernest Rutherford]], who is known as the \"father\" of [[nuclear physics]]. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ([[IUPAC]]) adopted ''unnilquadium'' (Unq) as a temporary, [[systematic element name]], derived from the Latin names for digits 1, 0, and 4. In 1994, IUPAC suggested the name ''dubnium'' (Db) to be used since ''rutherfordium'' was suggested for element 106 and IUPAC felt that the Dubna team should be recognized for their contributions. However, there was still a dispute over the names of elements 104\u2013107. In 1997 the teams involved resolved the dispute and adopted the current name ''rutherfordium''.

A few singular chemistry-related properties have been measured, but properties of rutherfordium metal remain unknown and only predictions are available.\n\n===Chemical===\nRutherfordium is the first [[transactinide element]] and the second member of the 6d series of transition metals. Calculations on its [[ionization potential]]s, [[atomic radius]], as well as radii, orbital energies, and ground levels of its ionized states are similar to that of [[hafnium]] and very different from that of [[lead]]. Therefore, it was concluded that rutherfordium's basic properties will resemble those of other [[group 4 element]]s, below [[titanium]], [[zirconium]], and hafnium.<ref name=Rf263/><ref name=\"Kratz03\" /> Some of its properties were determined by gas-phase experiments and aqueous chemistry. The oxidation state +4 is the only stable state for the latter two elements and therefore rutherfordium should also exhibit a stable +4 state.<ref name=\"Kratz03\" /> In addition, rutherfordium is also expected to be able to form a less stable +3 state.<ref name=Haire/> The [[standard reduction potential]] of the Rf<sup>4+</sup>/Rf couple is predicted to be higher than \u22121.7&nbsp;V.<ref name=BFricke/>\n\nInitial predictions of the chemical properties of rutherfordium were based on calculations which indicated that the relativistic effects on the electron shell might be strong enough that the [[p orbital|7p orbitals]] would have a lower energy level than the [[d orbital|6d orbitals]], giving it a [[valence electron]] configuration of 6d<sup>1</sup> 7s<sup>2</sup> 7p<sup>1</sup> or even 7s<sup>2</sup> 7p<sup>2</sup>, therefore making the element behave more like [[lead]] than hafnium. With better calculation methods and experimental studies of the chemical properties of rutherfordium compounds it could be shown that this does not happen and that rutherfordium instead behaves like the rest of the [[group 4 element]]s.<ref name=Haire/><ref name=\"Kratz03\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1351/pac200375010103 |url=http://stage.iupac.org/originalWeb/publications/pac/2003/pdf/7501x0103.pdf |title=Critical evaluation of the chemical properties of the transactinide elements (IUPAC Technical Report) |date=2003 |last1=Kratz |first1=J.

It reacts with halogens to form tetrahalides, RfX<sub>4</sub>, which hydrolyze on contact with water to form oxyhalides RfOX<sub>2</sub>. The tetrahalides are volatile solids existing as monomeric tetrahedral molecules in the vapor phase.<ref name=\"Kratz03\"/>\n\nIn the aqueous phase, the Rf<sup>4+</sup> ion hydrolyzes less than titanium(IV) and to a similar extent as zirconium and hafnium, thus resulting in the RfO<sup>2+</sup> ion. Treatment of the halides with halide ions promotes the formation of complex ions. The use of chloride and bromide ions produces the hexahalide complexes {{chem|RfCl|6|2-}} and {{chem|RfBr|6|2-}}. For the fluoride complexes, zirconium and hafnium tend to form hepta- and octa- complexes. Thus, for the larger rutherfordium ion, the complexes {{chem|RfF|6|2-}}, {{chem|RfF|7|3-}} and {{chem|RfF|8|4-}} are possible.<ref name=\"Kratz03\"/>\n\n===Physical and atomic===\nRutherfordium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a [[hexagonal close-packed]] crystal structure (<sup>''c''</sup>/<sub>''a''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.61), similar to its lighter [[congener (chemistry)|congener]] hafnium.<ref name=hcp/> It should be a very heavy metal with a [[density]] of around 23.2&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>; in comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, [[osmium]], has a density of 22.61&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>. This results from rutherfordium's high atomic weight, the [[lanthanide contraction|lanthanide and actinide contractions]], and [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]], although production of enough rutherfordium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.

He also killed travellers and guests, a violation of ''[[Xenia (Greek)|xenia]]'', which fell under [[Zeus]]'s domain. He took pleasure in these killings because they allowed him to maintain his iron-fisted rule.\n\n=== Conflict with Salmoneus ===\nSisyphus and his brother Salmoneus were known to hate each other, and Sisyphus consulted the [[Oracle]] of [[Delphi]] on just how to kill Salmoneus without incurring any severe consequences for himself. From [[Homer]] onward, Sisyphus was famed as the craftiest of men. He seduced Salmoneus's daughter [[Tyro]] in one of his plots to kill Salmoneus, only for Tyro to slay the children she bore him when she discovered that Sisyphus was planning on using them eventually to dethrone her father.\n\n=== Cheating death ===\nKing Sisyphus also betrayed one of Zeus's secrets by revealing the whereabouts of [[Aegina (mythology)|Aegina]], (an [[Asopides|Asopid]] who was taken away by Zeus) to her father (the river god [[Asopus]]) in return for causing a spring to flow on the Corinthian [[acropolis]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nZeus then ordered Death (in Greek, [[Thanatos]]) to chain King Sisyphus down below in [[Tartarus]]. Sisyphus was curious as to why [[Charon]], whose job it was to guide souls to the Underworld, had not appeared on this occasion. King Sisyphus slyly asked Thanatos to demonstrate how the chains worked. As Thanatos was granting him his wish, Sisyphus seized the opportunity and trapped Thanatos in the chains instead. Once Thanatos was bound by the strong chains, no one died on Earth. This caused an uproar especially for [[Ares]] (who was annoyed that his battles had lost their fun because his opponents would not die), and so he intervened. The exasperated Ares freed Thanatos and turned King Sisyphus over to him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oup.com/us/companion.websites/0195153448/studentresources/chapters/ch25/?view=usa |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173245/http://www.oup.com/us/companion.websites/0195153448/studentresources/chapters/ch25/?view=usa |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn another version, [[Hades]] was sent to chain Sisyphus and was chained himself. As long as Hades was tied up, nobody could die. Because of this, sacrifices could not be made to the gods, and those that were old and sick were suffering. The gods finally threatened to make life so miserable for Sisyphus that he would wish he were dead.

This caused King Sisyphus to end up on the shores of the river [[Styx]]. Then, complaining to [[Persephone]], goddess of the Underworld, that this was a sign of his wife's disrespect for him, King Sisyphus persuaded her to allow him to return to the upper world. Once back in Ephyra, the spirit of King Sisyphus scolded his wife for not burying his body and giving it a proper funeral (as a loving wife should). When King Sisyphus refused to return to the Underworld, he was forcibly dragged back there by [[Hades]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mythweb.com/encyc/entries/sisyphus.html|title=Encyclopedia of Greek Mythology: Sisyphus|website=www.mythweb.com|access-date=2019-07-01}}</ref><!-- (This version is alluded to by [[Albert Camus|Camus]] without citation and also appears in [[Roberto Bola\u00f1o]]'s novel ''2666'', in a context that indicates it may have been made up rather than traditional.) --> In another version of the myth, Persephone was tricked by Sisyphus that he had been conducted to [[Tartarus]] by mistake, and so she ordered that he be released.<ref>Bernard Evslin's ''gods, Demigods & Demons'', 209\u2013210</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Philoctetes (Sophocles play)|Philoctetes]]'' by [[Sophocles]], there is a reference to the father of [[Odysseus]] (rumoured to have been Sisyphus, and not [[La\u00ebrtes]], whom we know as the father in the ''[[Odyssey]]'') upon having returned from the dead.

The repetitive inhalation\u2013exhalation cycle is described esoterically in the myth as an up\u2013down motion of Sisyphus and his boulder on a hill.\n\nIn experiments that test how workers respond when the meaning of their task is diminished, the test condition is referred to as the Sisyphusian condition. The two main conclusions of the experiment are that people work harder when their work seems more meaningful, and that people underestimate the relationship between meaning and motivation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ariely|first=Dan|title=The Upside of Irrationality|year=2010|isbn=0-06-199503-7}}</ref>\n\nIn his book ''The Philosophy of Recursive Thinking'',<ref>Manfred Kopfer (2018); The Philosophy of Recursive Thinking, The recursive solution for Sisyphos problem. {{ISBN|978-3-7438-7149-6}}</ref> German author Manfred Kopfer suggested a viable solution for Sisyphus punishment. Every time Sisyphus reaches the top of the mountain, he breaks off a stone from the mountain and carries it down to the lowest point. This way, the mountain will eventually be levelled and the stone cannot roll down anymore. In Kopfers interpretation, the solution turns the punishment by the gods into a test for Sisyphus to prove his worthiness for godlike deeds. If Sisyphus is able \"to move a mountain\", he shall be allowed to do what otherwise only gods are entitled to do.\n\n===Literary interpretations===\n[[File:Punishment sisyph.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|alt=Painting of Sisyphus by Titian |''Sisyphus'' (1548\u201349) by [[Titian]], [[Prado Museum]], [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]]]\n[[Homer]] describes Sisyphus in both Book VI of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and Book XI of the ''[[Odyssey]]''.<ref name=\"Homer Iliad VI 152ff\"/><ref name=\"Odyssey, xi. 593\"/>\n\n[[Ovid]], the Roman poet, makes reference to Sisyphus in the story of [[Orpheus]] and [[Eurydice]].

He also killed travellers and guests, a violation of ''[[Xenia (Greek)|xenia]]'', which fell under [[Zeus]]'s domain. He took pleasure in these killings because they allowed him to maintain his iron-fisted rule.\n\n=== Conflict with Salmoneus ===\nSisyphus and his brother Salmoneus were known to hate each other, and Sisyphus consulted the [[Oracle]] of [[Delphi]] on just how to kill Salmoneus without incurring any severe consequences for himself. From [[Homer]] onward, Sisyphus was famed as the craftiest of men. He seduced Salmoneus's daughter [[Tyro]] in one of his plots to kill Salmoneus, only for Tyro to slay the children she bore him when she discovered that Sisyphus was planning on using them eventually to dethrone her father.\n\n=== Cheating death ===\nKing Sisyphus also betrayed one of Zeus's secrets by revealing the whereabouts of [[Aegina (mythology)|Aegina]], (an [[Asopides|Asopid]] who was taken away by Zeus) to her father (the river god [[Asopus]]) in return for causing a spring to flow on the Corinthian [[acropolis]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nZeus then ordered Death (in Greek, [[Thanatos]]) to chain King Sisyphus down below in [[Tartarus]]. Sisyphus was curious as to why [[Charon]], whose job it was to guide souls to the Underworld, had not appeared on this occasion. King Sisyphus slyly asked Thanatos to demonstrate how the chains worked. As Thanatos was granting him his wish, Sisyphus seized the opportunity and trapped Thanatos in the chains instead. Once Thanatos was bound by the strong chains, no one died on Earth. This caused an uproar especially for [[Ares]] (who was annoyed that his battles had lost their fun because his opponents would not die), and so he intervened. The exasperated Ares freed Thanatos and turned King Sisyphus over to him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oup.com/us/companion.websites/0195153448/studentresources/chapters/ch25/?view=usa |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173245/http://www.oup.com/us/companion.websites/0195153448/studentresources/chapters/ch25/?view=usa |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn another version, [[Hades]] was sent to chain Sisyphus and was chained himself. As long as Hades was tied up, nobody could die. Because of this, sacrifices could not be made to the gods, and those that were old and sick were suffering. The gods finally threatened to make life so miserable for Sisyphus that he would wish he were dead. He then had no choice but to release Hades.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Death.htm |title=Ancient Greeks: Is death necessary and can death actually harm us? |publisher=Mlahanas.de |accessdate=2014-02-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702053105/http://mlahanas.de/Greeks/Death.htm |archivedate=2 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nBefore King Sisyphus died, he had told his wife to throw his naked body into the middle of the public square (purportedly as a test of his wife's love for him). This caused King Sisyphus to end up on the shores of the river [[Styx]]. Then, complaining to [[Persephone]], goddess of the Underworld, that this was a sign of his wife's disrespect for him, King Sisyphus persuaded her to allow him to return to the upper world. Once back in Ephyra, the spirit of King Sisyphus scolded his wife for not burying his body and giving it a proper funeral (as a loving wife should). When King Sisyphus refused to return to the Underworld, he was forcibly dragged back there by [[Hades]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mythweb.com/encyc/entries/sisyphus.html|title=Encyclopedia of Greek Mythology: Sisyphus|website=www.mythweb.com|access-date=2019-07-01}}</ref><!-- (This version is alluded to by [[Albert Camus|Camus]] without citation and also appears in [[Roberto Bola\u00f1o]]'s novel ''2666'', in a context that indicates it may have been made up rather than traditional.) --> In another version of the myth, Persephone was tricked by Sisyphus that he had been conducted to [[Tartarus]] by mistake, and so she ordered that he be released.<ref>Bernard Evslin's ''gods, Demigods & Demons'', 209\u2013210</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Philoctetes (Sophocles play)|Philoctetes]]'' by [[Sophocles]], there is a reference to the father of [[Odysseus]] (rumoured to have been Sisyphus, and not [[La\u00ebrtes]], whom we know as the father in the ''[[Odyssey]]'') upon having returned from the dead. [[Euripides]], in ''[[Cyclops (play)|Cyclops]]'', also identifies Sisyphus as Odysseus' father.\n\n=== Punishment in the Underworld ===\nAs a punishment for his trickery, Zeus made King Sisyphus roll a huge boulder endlessly up a steep hill.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-eng2:11.13-11.13 |title=Homeros, Odyssey, 11.13 |publisher=Perseus Digital Library |date= |accessdate=2014-10-09}}</ref><ref name=\"Odyssey, xi. 593\">''[[Odyssey]]'', xi. 593</ref> The maddening nature of the punishment was reserved for King Sisyphus due to his [[hubris]]tic belief that his cleverness surpassed that of Zeus himself.

Thus it came to pass that pointless or interminable activities are sometimes described as ''Sisyphean''.

[[Albert Camus]], in his 1942 essay ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'', saw Sisyphus as personifying the absurdity of human life, but Camus concludes \"one must imagine Sisyphus happy\" as \"The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart.\"  More recently, [[J. Nigro Sansonese]],<ref>[[J. Nigro Sansonese|Sansonese, J. Nigro]]. ''The Body of Myth.'' Rochester, 1994, pp. 45\u201352. {{ISBN|0-89281-409-8}}</ref> building on the work of [[Georges Dum\u00e9zil]], speculates that the origin of the name \"Sisyphos\" is onomatopoetic of the continual back-and-forth, susurrant sound (\"siss phuss\") made by the breath in the nasal passages, situating the mythology of Sisyphus in a far larger context of archaic (see [[Proto-Indo-European religion]]) trance-inducing techniques related to breath control. The repetitive inhalation\u2013exhalation cycle is described esoterically in the myth as an up\u2013down motion of Sisyphus and his boulder on a hill.\n\nIn experiments that test how workers respond when the meaning of their task is diminished, the test condition is referred to as the Sisyphusian condition. The two main conclusions of the experiment are that people work harder when their work seems more meaningful, and that people underestimate the relationship between meaning and motivation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ariely|first=Dan|title=The Upside of Irrationality|year=2010|isbn=0-06-199503-7}}</ref>\n\nIn his book ''The Philosophy of Recursive Thinking'',<ref>Manfred Kopfer (2018); The Philosophy of Recursive Thinking, The recursive solution for Sisyphos problem. {{ISBN|978-3-7438-7149-6}}</ref> German author Manfred Kopfer suggested a viable solution for Sisyphus punishment. Every time Sisyphus reaches the top of the mountain, he breaks off a stone from the mountain and carries it down to the lowest point. This way, the mountain will eventually be levelled and the stone cannot roll down anymore. In Kopfers interpretation, the solution turns the punishment by the gods into a test for Sisyphus to prove his worthiness for godlike deeds. If Sisyphus is able \"to move a mountain\", he shall be allowed to do what otherwise only gods are entitled to do.\n\n===Literary interpretations===\n[[File:Punishment sisyph.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|alt=Painting of Sisyphus by Titian |''Sisyphus'' (1548\u201349) by [[Titian]], [[Prado Museum]], [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]]]\n[[Homer]] describes Sisyphus in both Book VI of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and Book XI of the ''[[Odyssey]]''.<ref name=\"Homer Iliad VI 152ff\"/><ref name=\"Odyssey, xi. 593\"/>\n\n[[Ovid]], the Roman poet, makes reference to Sisyphus in the story of [[Orpheus]] and [[Eurydice]].

After this song is sung, Ovid shows how moving it was by noting that Sisyphus, emotionally affected, for just a moment, stops his eternal task and sits on his rock, the Latin wording being ''inque tuo sedisti, Sisyphe, saxo'' (\"and you sat, Sisyphus, on your rock\").<ref>Ovid.

This was done for one out of every two students and she agreed with their parents and families that they should study and not be taken out of school till the end of their courses. This was the way she encouraged girls to stay in school and study. The school had two branches. One of the branches was Dar al-'Elm and various sciences (Such as reading and writing to mathematics and geography and foreign language training) were taught, and the condition of admission was passing a test held by the Ministry of Education. This school was located beside the garden of Asfal-Dooleh. The second branch, Dar Al- Sanayeh, was located in the Abmangel neighborhood, teaching works of art and [[Handicraft]]s (carpet [[weaving]], [[knitting]], etc).<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.beytoote.com/scientific/scientist/first-1woman1-journalist.html  The biography of the first female Iranian journalist]</ref>\n\n== First Iranian woman journalist ==\nAt a time when reading and writing were uncommon for women and the education of women was largely frowned upon, Maryam was able to launch the first Iranian [[women's magazine]]. This 8-page weekly magazine, known as Science, was published in [[Tehran]] in 1910. Although the magazine did not last long, it was an important development during the Constitutional era. \n\nMaryam Amid, known as the first female journalist in Iran, published the Shokoufeh Newspaper after the closure of the Science Weekly Magazine in 1913.\n\nThe following text was seen on the front page and certification of the journal:<ref name=\":0\" />\n{{quote|Awarding officer and director Maryam Amid, the daughter of the late Aqa Mirza Sayed Razi, was a journalist of ethics, literature, hygiene, child care, direct professional education of maidens, and the refinement of women's ethics about women's schools. Sometimes these were known in two levels.}}\n\n== Shokoufeh Newspaper ==\nThe ''Shokoufeh Newspaper'' was the second significant dedicated newspaper published for women after the Science Magazine (1910\u20131911) in 1913. This newspaper was published every week till the death of Maryam in 1919.\n\nThe features of this newspaper were written in a [[Humour|humorous]] and critical tone, such as addressing Iranian women's issues, [[Girls education|girls' education]], and political issues.\n\n=== From copies to caricaturing\t===\nThe newspaper, which was published almost every two weeks, originally consisted of four pages with the Traditional version in the writing of [[Naskh (script)|Naskhs]], but from the fifth issue was written with the [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script|Nastaliq]] version, and was printed after a year with lead letters. Also the final page of each issue was decorated with a [[caricature]], referring to the subject matter that the issue was about.  From the third year onward the caricatures were not included, after the start of the [[First World War]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Hemat Association ==\nThe Hemat Association was established in 1944 by the managers of the girls\u2019 schools. Maryam Amid, a member of this association, was instrumental in introducing and expanding its activities. One of the important goals of the association, which was headed by Mrs. Nuraldji, was to ban foreign products and prohibit imports of these products. For example, at that time the boycott of foreign textiles was on the agenda of this association, and all girls' schools (including students and teachers) were allowed to use only Iranian fabrics and, if there was a violation and purchase of foreign textiles, the guilty person would be fired. As a result, nearly five thousand people joined the boycott within a month. \n\n== War with superstition ==\nThe struggle against [[superstition]] and fighting against old traditions, especially among women was one of the activities of Maryam. She used the ''Shokoufeh newspaper'' to expose oppression  and her reactionary ideas. Maryam, in condemning women's [[underdeveloped]] traditions in [[Iran]], reviewed and compared the situation of women in other parts of the world (especially  of [[women in Europe]]), and considered this as the most important and fundamental way to improve women's awareness in Iran.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Death ==\nMaryam died in September 1919 during a trip to her hometown [[Semnan, Iran|Semnan]], of a heart attack. \n \n==See also==\n* [[Iranian women]]   \n* [[Women's rights movement in Iran]]\n* [[Women's rights in Iran]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* \u0641\u0631\u0647\u0646\u06af \u0642\u0648\u0645\u0633\u061b \u0641\u0635\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u067e\u0698\u0648\u0647\u0634\u06cc\u060c \u0641\u0631\u0647\u0646\u06af\u06cc\u060c \u0647\u0646\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0634\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u06f3\u06f7 \u0648 \u06f3\u06f8 \u0628\u0647\u0627\u0631 \u0648 \u062a\u0627\u0628\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u06f1\u06f3\u06f8\u06f6/Ghomis Culture, The quarterly research of cultural and artistic in Semnan Province, numbers 37\u201338, spring and summer 2007.\n* \u0631\u0648\u0632\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u0633\u0631\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u0647\u060c \u0634\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u06f2\u06f5\u06f7 (\u06f2 \u0634\u0647\u0631\u06cc\u0648\u0631 \u06f1\u06f3\u06f8\u06f5)-\tSarmayeh Newspaper, number 257, (24 August 2006). \n* [http://www.sharghnewspaper.ir/830514/media.htm#s94047 /Journalist women under the shadow of constitutionalism]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.barnameh-budjeh.com/npview.asp?ID=1118573 Maryam Amid, Girls' Literacy Light]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Amid, Maryam}}\n[[Category:People from Semnan, Iran]]\n[[Category:1919 deaths]]\n[[Category:Iranian journalists]]\n[[Category:Iranian women journalists]]\n[[Category:Iranian women's rights activists]]\n[[Category:Iranian women writers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{copyedit|date=April 2020}}\n'''Maryam Amid Semnani''' ({{lang-fa|\u0645\u0631\u06cc\u0645 \u0639\u0645\u06cc\u062f \u0633\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0646\u06cc}}), was an intellectual and a journalist during the [[Qajar era]].

The second branch, Dar Al- Sanayeh, was located in the Abmangel neighborhood, teaching works of art and [[Handicraft]]s (carpet [[weaving]], [[knitting]], etc).<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.beytoote.com/scientific/scientist/first-1woman1-journalist.html  The biography of the first female Iranian journalist]</ref>\n\n== First Iranian woman journalist ==\nAt a time when reading and writing were uncommon for women and the education of women was largely frowned upon, Maryam was able to launch the first Iranian [[women's magazine]]. This 8-page weekly magazine, known as Science, was published in [[Tehran]] in 1910. Although the magazine did not last long, it was an important development during the Constitutional era. \n\nMaryam Amid, known as the first female journalist in Iran, published the Shokoufeh Newspaper after the closure of the Science Weekly Magazine in 1913.\n\nThe following text was seen on the front page and certification of the journal:<ref name=\":0\" />\n{{quote|Awarding officer and director Maryam Amid, the daughter of the late Aqa Mirza Sayed Razi, was a journalist of ethics, literature, hygiene, child care, direct professional education of maidens, and the refinement of women's ethics about women's schools. Sometimes these were known in two levels.}}\n\n== Shokoufeh Newspaper ==\nThe ''Shokoufeh Newspaper'' was the second significant dedicated newspaper published for women after the Science Magazine (1910\u20131911) in 1913. This newspaper was published every week till the death of Maryam in 1919.\n\nThe features of this newspaper were written in a [[Humour|humorous]] and critical tone, such as addressing Iranian women's issues, [[Girls education|girls' education]], and political issues.\n\n=== From copies to caricaturing\t===\nThe newspaper, which was published almost every two weeks, originally consisted of four pages with the Traditional version in the writing of [[Naskh (script)|Naskhs]], but from the fifth issue was written with the [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script|Nastaliq]] version, and was printed after a year with lead letters. Also the final page of each issue was decorated with a [[caricature]], referring to the subject matter that the issue was about.  From the third year onward the caricatures were not included, after the start of the [[First World War]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Hemat Association ==\nThe Hemat Association was established in 1944 by the managers of the girls\u2019 schools. Maryam Amid, a member of this association, was instrumental in introducing and expanding its activities. One of the important goals of the association, which was headed by Mrs. Nuraldji, was to ban foreign products and prohibit imports of these products. For example, at that time the boycott of foreign textiles was on the agenda of this association, and all girls' schools (including students and teachers) were allowed to use only Iranian fabrics and, if there was a violation and purchase of foreign textiles, the guilty person would be fired. As a result, nearly five thousand people joined the boycott within a month. \n\n== War with superstition ==\nThe struggle against [[superstition]] and fighting against old traditions, especially among women was one of the activities of Maryam. She used the ''Shokoufeh newspaper'' to expose oppression  and her reactionary ideas. Maryam, in condemning women's [[underdeveloped]] traditions in [[Iran]], reviewed and compared the situation of women in other parts of the world (especially  of [[women in Europe]]), and considered this as the most important and [fundamental] way to improve women's awareness in Iran.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Death ==\nMaryam died in September 1919 during a trip to her hometown [[Semnan, Iran|Semnan]], of a heart attack. \n \n==See also==\n* [[Iranian women]]   \n* [[Women's rights movement in Iran]]\n* [[Women's rights in Iran]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* \u0641\u0631\u0647\u0646\u06af \u0642\u0648\u0645\u0633\u061b \u0641\u0635\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u067e\u0698\u0648\u0647\u0634\u06cc\u060c \u0641\u0631\u0647\u0646\u06af\u06cc\u060c \u0647\u0646\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0634\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u06f3\u06f7 \u0648 \u06f3\u06f8 \u0628\u0647\u0627\u0631 \u0648 \u062a\u0627\u0628\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u06f1\u06f3\u06f8\u06f6/Ghomis Culture, The quarterly research of cultural and artistic in Semnan Province, numbers 37\u201338, spring and summer 2007.\n* \u0631\u0648\u0632\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u0633\u0631\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u0647\u060c \u0634\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u06f2\u06f5\u06f7 (\u06f2 \u0634\u0647\u0631\u06cc\u0648\u0631 \u06f1\u06f3\u06f8\u06f5)-\tSarmayeh Newspaper, number 257, (24 August 2006). \n* [http://www.sharghnewspaper.ir/830514/media.htm#s94047 /Journalist women under the shadow of constitutionalism]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.barnameh-budjeh.com/npview.asp?ID=1118573 Maryam Amid, Girls' Literacy Light]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Amid, Maryam}}\n[[Category:People from Semnan, Iran]]\n[[Category:1919 deaths]]\n[[Category:Iranian journalists]]\n[[Category:Iranian women journalists]]\n[[Category:Iranian women's rights activists]]\n[[Category:Iranian women writers]]\n", "name_user": "Denisnevsky", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryam_Amid"}
