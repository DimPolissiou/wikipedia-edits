It is situated on a peninsula in the south of New Caledonia's main island, [[Grande Terre (New Caledonia)|Grande Terre]], and is home to the majority of the island's [[Europe]]an, [[Polynesia]]n ([[Wallis and Futuna|Wallisians]], [[Wallis and Futuna|Futunians]], [[Tahiti]]ans), [[Indonesia]]n, and [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] populations, as well as many [[Melanesian]]s, [[Ni-Vanuatu]] and [[Kanak people|Kanak]]s who work in one of the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]'s most [[industrialisation|industrialised]] cities. The city lies on a protected deepwater harbour that serves as the chief port for New Caledonia.\n\nAt the September 2019 census, there were 182,341 inhabitants in the metropolitan area of Greater Noum\u00e9a ({{Lang-fr|agglom\u00e9ration du Grand Noum\u00e9a}}), 94,285 of whom lived in the city ([[communes of France|commune]]) of Noum\u00e9a proper.<ref name=pop>{{cite web|url=http://www.isee.nc/component/phocadownload/category/194-structure-de-la-population-et-evolutions?download=1329:population-legale-2014|title=Recensement de la population 2014 - Populations l\u00e9gales 2014|publisher=ISEE|accessdate=2014-11-16|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150419171546/http://www.isee.nc/component/phocadownload/category/194-structure-de-la-population-et-evolutions?download=1329:population-legale-2014|archivedate=19 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> 67.2% of the population of New Caledonia live in Greater Noum\u00e9a, which covers the communes of Noum\u00e9a, [[Le Mont-Dore (New Caledonia)|Le Mont-Dore]], [[Dumb\u00e9a]] and [[Pa\u00efta]].\n\n==History==\nThe first European to establish a settlement in the vicinity was British trader [[James Paddon]] in 1851. Anxious to assert control of the island, the French established a settlement nearby three years later in 1854, moving from [[Balade (New Caledonia)|Balade]] in the north of the island. This settlement was initially called Port-de-France and was renamed Noum\u00e9a in 1866. The area served first as a [[penal colony]], later as a centre for the exportation of the [[nickel]] and [[gold]] that was mined nearby.\n\nFrom 1904 to 1940 Noum\u00e9a was linked to [[Dumb\u00e9a]] and [[Pa\u00efta]] by the [[Noum\u00e9a-Pa\u00efta railway]], the only railway line that ever existed in New Caledonia.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Noum\u00e9a served as the headquarters of the [[United States]] military in the South Pacific. The five-sided U.S. military headquarters  complex was adopted after the war as the base for a new regional intergovernmental development organisation: the South Pacific Commission, later known as the [[Secretariat of the Pacific Community]], and later still as the Pacific Community.\n\nThe city maintains much of New Caledonia's unique mix of French and old Melanesian culture. Even today the [[United States|US]] wartime military influence lingers, both with the warmth that many New Caledonian people feel towards the United States after experiencing the relative friendliness of American soldiers and also with the names of several of the quarters in Noum\u00e9a. Districts such as \"Receiving\" and \"Robinson\", or even \"Motor Pool\", strike the [[English-speaking world|anglophone]] ear strangely, until the historical context becomes clear.\n\n==Geography==\nThe [[city]] is situated on an irregular, hilly [[peninsula]] near the southeast end of [[New Caledonia]], which is in the south-west [[Pacific Ocean]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nNeighbourhoods of Noum\u00e9a include:<ref>\"[http://www.ville-noumea.nc/vivre/quartiers.asp Les quartiers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722112059/http://www.ville-noumea.nc/vivre/quartiers.asp |date=22 July 2011 }}.\" Noum\u00e9a.

It is situated on a peninsula in the south of New Caledonia's main island, [[Grande Terre (New Caledonia)|Grande Terre]], and is home to the majority of the island's [[Europe]]an, [[Polynesia]]n ([[Wallis and Futuna|Wallisians]], [[Wallis and Futuna|Futunians]], [[Tahiti]]ans), [[Indonesia]]n, and [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] populations, as well as many [[Melanesian]]s, [[Ni-Vanuatu]] and [[Kanak people|Kanak]]s who work in one of the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]'s most [[industrialisation|industrialised]] cities. The city lies on a protected deepwater harbour that serves as the chief port for New Caledonia.\n\nAt the September 2019 census, there were 182,341 inhabitants in the metropolitan area of Greater Noum\u00e9a ({{Lang-fr|agglom\u00e9ration du Grand Noum\u00e9a}}), 94,285 of whom lived in the city ([[communes of France|commune]]) of Noum\u00e9a proper.<ref name=pop>{{cite web|url=http://www.isee.nc/component/phocadownload/category/194-structure-de-la-population-et-evolutions?download=1329:population-legale-2014|title=Recensement de la population 2014 - Populations l\u00e9gales 2014|publisher=ISEE|accessdate=2014-11-16|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150419171546/http://www.isee.nc/component/phocadownload/category/194-structure-de-la-population-et-evolutions?download=1329:population-legale-2014|archivedate=19 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> 67.2% of the population of New Caledonia live in Greater Noum\u00e9a, which covers the communes of Noum\u00e9a, [[Le Mont-Dore (New Caledonia)|Le Mont-Dore]], [[Dumb\u00e9a]] and [[Pa\u00efta]].\n\n==History==\nThe first European to establish a settlement in the vicinity was British trader [[James Paddon]] in 1851. Anxious to assert control of the island, the French established a settlement nearby three years later in 1854, moving from [[Balade (New Caledonia)|Balade]] in the north of the island. This settlement was initially called Port-de-France and was renamed Noum\u00e9a in 1866. The area served first as a [[penal colony]], later as a centre for the exportation of the [[nickel]] and [[gold]] that was mined nearby.\n\nFrom 1904 to 1940 Noum\u00e9a was linked to [[Dumb\u00e9a]] and [[Pa\u00efta]] by the [[Noum\u00e9a-Pa\u00efta railway]], the only railway line that ever existed in New Caledonia.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Noum\u00e9a served as the headquarters of the [[United States]] military in the South Pacific. The five-sided U.S. military headquarters  complex was adopted after the war as the base for a new regional intergovernmental development organisation: the South Pacific Commission, later known as the [[Secretariat of the Pacific Community]], and later still as the Pacific Community.\n\nThe city maintains much of New Caledonia's unique mix of French and old Melanesian culture. Even today the [[United States|US]] wartime military influence lingers, both with the warmth that many New Caledonian people feel towards the United States after experiencing the relative friendliness of American soldiers and also with the names of several of the quarters in Noum\u00e9a. Districts such as \"Receiving\" and \"Robinson\", or even \"Motor Pool\", strike the [[English-speaking world|anglophone]] ear strangely, until the historical context becomes clear.\n\n==Geography==\nThe [[city]] is situated on an irregular, hilly [[peninsula]] near the southeast end of [[New Caledonia]], which is in the south-west [[Pacific Ocean]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nNeighbourhoods of Noum\u00e9a include:<ref>\"[http://www.ville-noumea.nc/vivre/quartiers.asp Les quartiers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722112059/http://www.ville-noumea.nc/vivre/quartiers.asp |date=22 July 2011 }}.\" Noum\u00e9a.

There she saw the woman, squatting, with her jogging shorts around her ankles. When Budde confronted the woman about having [[open defecation|defecated in public]] and allowing the Budde children to see her private parts in the process, the woman said \"Yeah ... sorry\" and left after pulling up her shorts. Budde assumed she would return quickly to clean up the feces, and never again jog in the area due to the embarrassment the incident caused.<ref name=\"Washington Post story\" />\n\nInstead, the Buddes found feces at the same spot on the sidewalk at least once a week.{{efn|A similar incident occurred in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], in 2013.

On three occasions Budde saw the woman defecate.<ref name=\"Washington Post story\" /> The Budde children began calling her \"The Mad Pooper of Pine Creek\" after a stream that flows through the neighborhood, sometimes used as its name.<ref name=\"KKTV story\" />\n\n\"This is intentional\", Budde told ''[[The Washington Post]]''. There are, she explained, several [[public toilet]]s nearby the woman could use. There is one across the street, [[portable toilet]]s in a nearby public park, and some at a gas station a short distance away. All would be easy for the jogger to use if she regularly had the need while running. Neighbors also told Budde they had seen the woman defecating in their back yards as well as near a local [[Walgreens]] drugstore.<ref name=\"Washington Post story\" />\n\nBudde notified the [[Colorado Springs Police Department]] (CSPD), and made attempts on her own to end the jogger's defecations. She took pictures from the house, capturing a short brown-haired woman in a gray tank top and shorts. She put up a printed paper sign at the place near her house favored by the jogger, warning her that the police were aware of the situation, and asking her to stop.<ref name=\"Washington Post story\" />\n\nIn response, Budde said, the woman began changing the times she jogged by. She also ignored the note's pleas, running by it 15 times in one day before defecating near it again, according to Budde. The police have said she could face charges of [[Indecent exposure in the United States|indecent exposure]] and [[public defecation]] were they to identify and arrest her,<ref name=\"Washington Post story\" /> charges that, in the event of a conviction, might require that she [[Sex offender registries in the United States|register as a sex offender]].<ref name=\"KRDO spokesman story\">{{cite news|last=Clemens|first=Dana|title=Attorneys discuss rights to pooping in public after \"Mad Pooper\" video release|url=http://www.krdo.com/news/colorado-springs/mad-pooper-spokesman-explains/626058098|newspaper=[[KRDO-TV]]|date=September 27, 2017|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOne officer, Lt. Howard Black, said he had never seen anything similar in his 35-year career in Colorado Springs. Like Budde, he admitted to the ''Post'' that it was amusing, but allowed for the possibility that the jogger might not be in full control of her actions. \"If it's a mental health issue, she'll still be held accountable, but we would want to get her help.\"<ref name=\"Washington Post story\" />\n\nIn September, almost two months after the jogger's defecations had begun, Budde went to KKTV, which reported on the story. Shortly afterwards, the ''Post'' wrote its article, and the story [[Viral phenomenon|went viral]].<ref name=\"Fox News October story\">{{cite news|title='Mad Pooper' inquiries should stop now, Colorado police say|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/04/mad-pooper-inquiries-should-stop-now-colorado-police-say.html|newspaper=[[Fox News]]|date=October 4, 2017|accessdate=November 1, 2017}}</ref> Through its [[Twitter]] account, [[Procter & Gamble]] made an offer to the jogger: if she turned herself in to police, they would give her a year's supply of the company's [[Charmin]] toilet paper for free.<ref name=\"P&G tweet\" />\n\n''[[Runner's World]]'' magazine ran a story with a headline asking the woman to stop. \"[A]s runners, we understand having a sudden emergency now and then.

However, despite the increase in publicity around the case the woman has not been identified.<ref name=\"Fox News October story\" />\n\n===Hoax spokesman===\n\nIn response to the news coverage, a video was posted on [[YouTube]] by someone who claimed to be a family member of the jogger, who he called \"Shirley\". He said she was sorry for repeatedly fouling the Buddes' yard. However he also attributed her inability to control herself to a [[traumatic brain injury]] and complications from recent [[Sex reassignment surgery (male-to-female)|sex reassignment surgery]].<ref name=\"KRDO spokesman story\" />\n\nBeyond that, however, he said it was irrelevant as she was not breaking any law. Her actions, he argued, were protected under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], much like [[breastfeeding]]. Jeremy Loew, a criminal defense attorney consulted by Colorado Springs television station [[KRDO-TV]] emphatically rejected that claim. If the video truly was posted by \"Shirley\"'s family, Loew said, it was \"actually the worst thing the[y] could do. ... Maybe they thought the videos would make the situation go away, but they won't.\" The spokesman might even find himself called as a witness, Loew added.<ref name=\"KRDO spokesman story\" />\n\nA few days later, the man posted a second video in which he disclosed that the first one was a hoax.<ref name=\"Thrillist videos post\">{{cite news|last=Blum|first=Sam|title=The Mad Pooper Is Sorry For Repeatedly Pooping on Colorado Family's Lawn|url=https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/mad-pooper-colorado-jogger-apologizes-for-pooping-on-familys-lawn|newspaper=[[Thrillist]]|date=September 30, 2017|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}</ref> He was later revealed to be DISOP TV, another YouTube user known for producing videos of flatulent pets, who admitted he made up the first video as \"satire.\" Both that video and the original were soon deleted from the site.<ref name=\"Deadspin October story\" />\n\n==Possible motives==\n\nSome news outlets went beyond reporting on the case to speculate as to what the reasons for the jogger's actions might be. Allison Feller, a writer for ''[[Women's Health (magazine)|Women's Health]]'', wondered if, like her, the Mad Pooper might be an avid runner who suffers from [[Crohn's disease]], a bowel inflammation whose symptoms can sometimes include an [[Fecal incontinence|inability to hold excrement long enough to reach a toilet]]. \"[M]y first thought upon seeing this headline\" she recalled, \"was, 'Oh my god, being the subject of this story is my greatest fear.'\"<ref name=\"Women's Health story\">{{cite news|last=Feller|first=Allison|title=Why I'm Not Laughing At That Viral Story About A Jogger Dubbed 'The Mad Pooper'|url=https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/pooping-runner-mad-pooper|newspaper=[[Women's Health (magazine)|Women's Health]]|date=September 20, 2017|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSometimes her disease left her in such pain as to be unable to run or even leave the house, Feller wrote. But when it did, she would experience symptoms very suddenly. \"[Crohn's] can strike when you least expect it. And when that happens, my intestines go from totally chill to totally explosive faster than you can even ''think'' about where the closest available restroom may be.\"<ref name=\"Women's Health story\" />\n\nFeller said she, too, took toilet paper and wipes with her every time she went for a run. \"I don't run with these things because I'm ''planning'' to use them. I run with them because I've learned to be prepared.\" She recounted many times when, due to public bathrooms being closed or too distant for her to reach she had had to seclude herself behind trees or under bridges in order to defecate. One time, she admitted, she had even had to use her pants.<ref name=\"Women's Health story\" />\n\n\"In an age where everyone is armed with a cell-phone camera, I am terrified of someone seeing me going to the bathroom in an unapproved place, then snapping a photo or video, and posting it for the world to see, LOL at, and comment on\", Feller wrote. She felt considerable shame over the way her disease inconvenienced her, and called the idea of experiencing [[public shaming]] on the Internet because of it \"paralyzing\". She warned readers who might not understand that feeling that they should not shame someone they see experiencing similar distress while running. \"[O]ne day, you, too, may eat a burrito that doesn't agree with your stomach, and you may find yourself in a non-bathroom bathroom situation.<ref name=\"Women's Health story\" />\n\nAt ''[[Psychology Today]]'', Dale Hartley, an associate professor of psychology at [[West Virginia University at Parkersburg]], was dismissive of the idea that the Mad Pooper might suffer from an ailment that caused those problems, since she was so public in her defecations and had shown no sign of changing her routine to avoid having to do so. Nor did he think she had any [[psychosis]], as she was \"too put-together to be out of touch with reality\" and kept to a regular schedule. \"We would not expect to see consistently organized, predictable behaviors in someone who has undergone a psychotic break,\" Hartley wrote.<ref name=\"Psychology Today blog post\">{{cite news|last=Hartley|first=Dale|title=What's Up with the Mad Pooper of Colorado Springs?|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/machiavellians-gulling-the-rubes/201709/whats-the-mad-pooper-colorado-springs|newspaper=[[Psychology Today]]|date=September 20, 2017|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIt was more likely, Hartley presumed, that some lesser psychological issues led to her actions. \"Is she an [[exhibitionism|exhibitionist]]?  I think this is closer to the truth\", he wrote. But even if this was so, he believed, the jogger's real problem was [[impulse control disorder]].\n{{quote|When they bare it all, exhibitionists have failed to control their impulse to reveal too much. The mad pooper's abnormal impulse may or may not be exhibitionism. She might instead feel an overwhelming urge to experience the sensation of a bowel movement out in the open air.

When Budde confronted the woman about having [[open defecation|defecated in public]] and allowing the Budde children to see her private parts in the process, the woman said \"Yeah ... sorry\" and left after pulling up her shorts. Budde assumed she would return quickly to clean up the feces, and never again jog in the area due to the embarrassment the incident caused.<ref name=\"Washington Post story\" />\n\nInstead, the Buddes found feces at the same spot on the sidewalk at least once a week.{{efn|A similar incident occurred in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], in 2013. [[Security camera]]s outside a home in that city's [[Nob Hill, Albuquerque, New Mexico|Nob Hill]] neighborhood repeatedly caught the same woman jogging past and defecating on weekend mornings. She, too, was never identified.<ref name=\"KOAT 2013 story\">{{cite news|last=Colorado|first=Melissa|title=She did what?!?

On three occasions Budde saw the woman defecate.<ref name=\"Washington Post story\" /> The Budde children began calling her \"The Mad Pooper of Pine Creek\" after a stream that flows through the neighborhood, sometimes used as its name.<ref name=\"KKTV story\" />\n\n\"This is intentional\", Budde told ''[[The Washington Post]]''. There are, she explained, several [[public toilet]]s nearby the woman could use. There is one across the street, [[portable toilet]]s in a nearby public park, and some at a gas station a short distance away. All would be easy for the jogger to use if she regularly had the need while running. Neighbors also told Budde they had seen the woman defecating in their back yards as well as near a local [[Walgreens]] drugstore.<ref name=\"Washington Post story\" />\n\nBudde notified the [[Colorado Springs Police Department]] (CSPD), and made attempts on her own to end the jogger's defecations. She took pictures from the house, capturing a short brown-haired woman in a gray tank top and shorts. She put up a printed paper sign at the place near her house favored by the jogger, warning her that the police were aware of the situation, and asking her to stop.<ref name=\"Washington Post story\" />\n\nIn response, Budde said, the woman began changing the times she jogged by. She also ignored the note's pleas, running by it 15 times in one day before defecating near it again, according to Budde. The police have said she could face charges of [[Indecent exposure in the United States|indecent exposure]] and [[public defecation]] were they to identify and arrest her,<ref name=\"Washington Post story\" /> charges that, in the event of a conviction, might require that she [[Sex offender registries in the United States|register as a sex offender]].<ref name=\"KRDO spokesman story\">{{cite news|last=Clemens|first=Dana|title=Attorneys discuss rights to pooping in public after \"Mad Pooper\" video release|url=http://www.krdo.com/news/colorado-springs/mad-pooper-spokesman-explains/626058098|newspaper=[[KRDO-TV]]|date=September 27, 2017|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOne officer, Lt. Howard Black, said he had never seen anything similar in his 35-year career in Colorado Springs. Like Budde, he admitted to the ''Post'' that it was amusing, but allowed for the possibility that the jogger might not be in full control of her actions. \"If it's a mental health issue, she'll still be held accountable, but we would want to get her help.\"<ref name=\"Washington Post story\" />\n\nIn September, almost two months after the jogger's defecations had begun, Budde went to KKTV, which reported on the story. Shortly afterwards, the ''Post'' wrote its article, and the story [[Viral phenomenon|went viral]].<ref name=\"Fox News October story\">{{cite news|title='Mad Pooper' inquiries should stop now, Colorado police say|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/04/mad-pooper-inquiries-should-stop-now-colorado-police-say.html|newspaper=[[Fox News]]|date=October 4, 2017|accessdate=November 1, 2017}}</ref> Through its [[Twitter]] account, [[Procter & Gamble]] made an offer to the jogger: if she turned herself in to police, they would give her a year's supply of the company's [[Charmin]] toilet paper for free.<ref name=\"P&G tweet\" />\n\n''[[Runner's World]]'' magazine ran a story with a headline asking the woman to stop. \"[A]s runners, we understand having a sudden emergency now and then. But when it becomes a habit, you need to change up your regimen.\" it wrote, giving readers the phone number for the CSPD to call if they believed they knew who the Mad Pooper was. The article further urged readers who might similarly be using public places to defecate on their runs to likewise stop. \"Pull up your pants, and take your business elsewhere. We do not know what else to say.\"<ref name=\"Runner's World editorial\">{{cite news|title=We Urge You 'Mad Pooper,' Stop Crapping in Your Neighbor's Yard|url=https://www.runnersworld.com/poop/we-urge-you-mad-pooper-stop-crapping-in-your-neighbors-yard|newspaper=[[Runner's World]]|date=September 19, 2017|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSports news website ''[[Deadspin]]'' called the CSPD about the case so frequently the department asked them to stop in early October since they had nothing new to report.<ref name=\"Deadspin October story\">{{cite news|last=Redford|first=Patrick|title=Colorado Springs Police Beg Us To Stop Calling About The Mad Pooper, Who Is Still At Large|url=https://deadspin.com/colorado-springs-police-beg-us-to-stop-calling-about-th-1819084370|newspaper=[[Deadspin]]|date=October 3, 2017|accessdate=November 1, 2017}}</ref> Since then, police report, the woman appears to have stopped. However, despite the increase in publicity around the case the woman has not been identified.<ref name=\"Fox News October story\" />\n\n===Hoax spokesman===\n\nIn response to the news coverage, a video was posted on [[YouTube]] by someone who claimed to be a family member of the jogger, who he called \"Shirley\". He said she was sorry for repeatedly fouling the Buddes' yard. However he also attributed her inability to control herself to a [[traumatic brain injury]] and complications from recent [[Sex reassignment surgery (male-to-female)|sex reassignment surgery]].<ref name=\"KRDO spokesman story\" />\n\nBeyond that, however, he said it was irrelevant as she was not breaking any law. Her actions, he argued, were protected under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], much like [[breastfeeding]]. Jeremy Loew, a criminal defense attorney consulted by Colorado Springs television station [[KRDO-TV]] emphatically rejected that claim. If the video truly was posted by \"Shirley\"'s family, Loew said, it was \"actually the worst thing the[y] could do. ... Maybe they thought the videos would make the situation go away, but they won't.\" The spokesman might even find himself called as a witness, Loew added.<ref name=\"KRDO spokesman story\" />\n\nA few days later, the man posted a second video in which he disclosed that the first one was a hoax.<ref name=\"Thrillist videos post\">{{cite news|last=Blum|first=Sam|title=The Mad Pooper Is Sorry For Repeatedly Pooping on Colorado Family's Lawn|url=https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/mad-pooper-colorado-jogger-apologizes-for-pooping-on-familys-lawn|newspaper=[[Thrillist]]|date=September 30, 2017|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}</ref> He was later revealed to be DISOP TV, another YouTube user known for producing videos of flatulent pets, who admitted he made up the first video as \"satire.\" Both that video and the original were soon deleted from the site.<ref name=\"Deadspin October story\" />\n\n==Possible motives==\n\nSome news outlets went beyond reporting on the case to speculate as to what the reasons for the jogger's actions might be. Allison Feller, a writer for ''[[Women's Health (magazine)|Women's Health]]'', wondered if, like her, the Mad Pooper might be an avid runner who suffers from [[Crohn's disease]], a bowel inflammation whose symptoms can sometimes include an [[Fecal incontinence|inability to hold excrement long enough to reach a toilet]]. \"[M]y first thought upon seeing this headline\" she recalled, \"was, 'Oh my god, being the subject of this story is my greatest fear.'\"<ref name=\"Women's Health story\">{{cite news|last=Feller|first=Allison|title=Why I'm Not Laughing At That Viral Story About A Jogger Dubbed 'The Mad Pooper'|url=https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/pooping-runner-mad-pooper|newspaper=[[Women's Health (magazine)|Women's Health]]|date=September 20, 2017|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSometimes her disease left her in such pain as to be unable to run or even leave the house, Feller wrote. But when it did, she would experience symptoms very suddenly. \"[Crohn's] can strike when you least expect it. And when that happens, my intestines go from totally chill to totally explosive faster than you can even ''think'' about where the closest available restroom may be.\"<ref name=\"Women's Health story\" />\n\nFeller said she, too, took toilet paper and wipes with her every time she went for a run. \"I don't run with these things because I'm ''planning'' to use them. I run with them because I've learned to be prepared.\" She recounted many times when, due to public bathrooms being closed or too distant for her to reach she had had to seclude herself behind trees or under bridges in order to defecate. One time, she admitted, she had even had to use her pants.<ref name=\"Women's Health story\" />\n\n\"In an age where everyone is armed with a cell-phone camera, I am terrified of someone seeing me going to the bathroom in an unapproved place, then snapping a photo or video, and posting it for the world to see, LOL at, and comment on\", Feller wrote. She felt considerable shame over the way her disease inconvenienced her, and called the idea of experiencing [[public shaming]] on the Internet because of it \"paralyzing\". She warned readers who might not understand that feeling that they should not shame someone they see experiencing similar distress while running. \"[O]ne day, you, too, may eat a burrito that doesn't agree with your stomach, and you may find yourself in a non-bathroom bathroom situation.<ref name=\"Women's Health story\" />\n\nAt ''[[Psychology Today]]'', Dale Hartley, an associate professor of psychology at [[West Virginia University at Parkersburg]], was dismissive of the idea that the Mad Pooper might suffer from an ailment that caused those problems, since she was so public in her defecations and had shown no sign of changing her routine to avoid having to do so. Nor did he think she had any [[psychosis]], as she was \"too put-together to be out of touch with reality\" and kept to a regular schedule. \"We would not expect to see consistently organized, predictable behaviors in someone who has undergone a psychotic break,\" Hartley wrote.<ref name=\"Psychology Today blog post\">{{cite news|last=Hartley|first=Dale|title=What's Up with the Mad Pooper of Colorado Springs?|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/machiavellians-gulling-the-rubes/201709/whats-the-mad-pooper-colorado-springs|newspaper=[[Psychology Today]]|date=September 20, 2017|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIt was more likely, Hartley presumed, that some lesser psychological issues led to her actions. \"Is she an [[exhibitionism|exhibitionist]]?  I think this is closer to the truth\", he wrote. But even if this was so, he believed, the jogger's real problem was [[impulse control disorder]].\n{{quote|When they bare it all, exhibitionists have failed to control their impulse to reveal too much. The mad pooper's abnormal impulse may or may not be exhibitionism. She might instead feel an overwhelming urge to experience the sensation of a bowel movement out in the open air.

So whatever itch she's scratching, I'd put my money on an impulse control disorder as the milk in her magnesia.}}\nHer choice of the same location for so many of her defecations, Hartley also speculated, may have been retaliation against the Buddes for having caught her in the act.<ref name=\"Psychology Today blog post\" />\n\n==Other instances==\n===The Newcastle Star Jumper===\nAn instance was reported by the [[Newcastle Chronicle]] in the [[United Kingdom]] of a female jogger caught defecating on CCTV in the outskirts of [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]].<ref name=\"Shopkeeper furious after CCTV captures moment jogger appears to defecate outside store\">{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Ian|title=Shopkeeper furious after CCTV captures moment jogger appears to defecate outside store|url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/shopkeeper-furious-after-cctv-captures-16780061|newspaper=[[Newcastle Chronicle]]|date=August 22, 2019|accessdate=August 22, 2019}}</ref> Nicknamed the \"Star Jumper\" due to her performing [[star jumps]] after the act, she has not been identified.\n\n===The Lincoln Pooper===\n[[1011now]] reported an unknown female in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] who'd been caught on camera pooing outside a local swimming pool.<ref name=\"Woman caught defecating near local swimming pool\">{{cite news|last=1011now|first=1011now|title=Woman caught defecating near local swimming pool|url=https://www.1011now.com/content/news/Woman-caught-defecating-near-local-swimming-pool-494011931.html|date=September 21, 2018|accessdate=September 21, 2018}}</ref>   Having been noted on multiple occasions to repeat the act before the pool opened and after it closed, at the time of the report she had yet to be identified.\n\n===The Brisbane Poo Jogger===\n[[News.com.au]] reported a male 64 year old male corporate executive nicknamed the \"Poo Jogger\" also caught on camera in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]].<ref name=\"Doctors explain the possible reasons why people poo in public\">{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Vanessa|title=Doctors explain the possible reasons why people poo in public|url=https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/psychologist-explains-the-possible-reasons-why-people-poo-in-public/news-story/46b58e6e5f6246323e9a75f52a6b470f|date=June 9, 2018|accessdate=June 9, 2018}}</ref> The suspect was caught after residents banded together after suspected multiple instances and photographed the culprit in the act.

Born in Ayr, Scotland in 1788 David Lennox was trained as a stonemason. He worked on Telford's [[Menai, New South Wales|Menai]] Suspension Bridge at Anglesey in Wales and on [[Gloucester, New South Wales|Gloucester]] Bridge where he learnt the sound construction principles he used on his Colonial projects. He emigrated to Australia in 1832.<ref name=nswshr-1472/>\n\nHe immediately found employment as a mason with the government. While working at the [[New South Wales Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] Chambers in [[Macquarie Street, Sydney]], Lennox met the [[Surveyor General of New South Wales|Surveyor-General]] [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Sir Thomas Mitchell]].<ref name=nswshr-1472/>\n\nThe Surveyor-General lost little time in submitting Lennox's credentials to the [[Governor of New South Wales|Governor]], describing him as \"a very well qualified person recently arrived in the Colony.\" Acting on Mitchell's recommendation, [[Richard Bourke|Governor Bourke]] provisionally appointed Lennox as a Sub-Inspector of Bridges at a salary of [[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]120 per annum. In June 1833 the position was confirmed by London as Superintendent of Bridges.<ref name=nswshr-1472/>\n\nIn 1832, the Surveyor-General at the time, [[Sir Thomas Mitchell]], commissioned Lennox for a sum of A\u00a31,083<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2208948 |title=Votes and Proceedings. |newspaper=[[Sydney Gazette|The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser]] |volume=XXX |issue=2192 |date=11 October 1832 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> to build a bridge at the intersection of Prospect Creek and Southern Street,<ref name = \"rms\"/><ref name=nswshr-1472/> which would replace the nearby \"Bowler's Bridge\" named after Lansdowne's local innkeeper.<ref name=\"ea\">{{cite web|url=https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/portal/system/files/engineering-heritage-australia/nomination-title/Lennoxs_Lansdowne_Bridge_Nomination.pdf|title=Lennox's Lansdowne Bridge|publisher=The Institution of Engineers Australia|date=March 1986|access-date=6 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117033240/https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/portal/system/files/engineering-heritage-australia/nomination-title/Lennoxs_Lansdowne_Bridge_Nomination.pdf|archive-date=17 November 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The sandstone used in designing the bridge was found in a quarry only {{convert|11|km}} from the proposed site of the bridge, allowing workers to row a [[punt (boat)|punt]] to transport the stone to the construction site.<ref name=nswshr-1472/>\n\nIn July 1833 Lennox told Mitchell of a mutiny that had occurred at the quarry while he had been away on an inspection tour. Some of the convicts had rebelled and had consumed the contents of a nearby liquor still. Returning to the camp drunk they threatened to kill the supervisor and destroy the camp and quarrying equipment. The police from [[Liverpool, New South Wales|Liverpool]] were called and arrested the offenders. Retribution at Liverpool Court was swift and savage; those who were spared the chain gang received up to fifty lashes of the \"cat\".<ref name=nswshr-1472/>\n\nOn 1 January 1834, Governor Bourke visited the site of the bridge to lay the foundation stone. Within hours of the laying of the inscription plate it was stolen. Lennox made arrangements to obtain a duplicate plate but the original was found and restored to the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1472/> The [[foundation stone]] was laid on 1 January 1834. The bridge was constructed entirely by unskilled Australian convicts, despite Lennox's numerous requests to Mitchell for skilled labourers.<ref name=\"ea\"/> The bridge was completed a year later in 1835, and opened on 26 January 1836, the 48th anniversary of the [[Colony of New South Wales]], before a crowd of around 1,000.<ref name = \"rms\"/><ref name=\"ea\"/> Later, [[Richard Bourke]], the [[Governor of New South Wales]], wrote that the bridge had cost only A\u00a31,000 to build, compared to the A\u00a37,000 it would have taken to build a bridge of the same quality in England.<ref name=\"ea\"/>\n\nOn 7 June 1834 Lennox applied for more labourers, the bridge being at a stage where the centring could commence. This was the construction of a rigid timber frame to hold each stone in place until the arch became self-supporting. It was a critical process and any inaccuracies would cause instability or collapse the arch.<ref name=nswshr-1472/>\n\nUpon receiving a report that the bridge was nearing completion, Governor Bourke selected 26 January 1836 for the official opening date, as this coincided with the 48th anniversary of the Colony's foundation. The Lansdowne Bridge was not ready for several months as the Toll House was not complete. Once tolls started to be collected however, the bridge soon recovered its cost and in 1844 annual receipts were 685 pounds.<ref name=\"nswshr-1472-2378\">George, 1982</ref><ref name=\"nswshr-1472\" />\n\nIn 1956, the [[Government of New South Wales|New South Wales government]] duplicated the original bridge with a new concrete arch bridge parallel to the existing to carry southbound traffic of the [[Hume Highway]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Roadmakers, A History of Main Roads in New South Wales|last=|first=|publisher=Department of Main Roads|year=|isbn=0 7240 0439 4|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nA large [[sandstone]] arched bridge spanning the Prospect Creek.

Born in Ayr, Scotland in 1788 David Lennox was trained as a stonemason. He worked on Telford's [[Menai, New South Wales|Menai]] Suspension Bridge at Anglesey in Wales and on [[Gloucester, New South Wales|Gloucester]] Bridge where he learnt the sound construction principles he used on his Colonial projects. He emigrated to Australia in 1832.<ref name=nswshr-1472/>\n\nHe immediately found employment as a mason with the government. While working at the [[New South Wales Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] Chambers in [[Macquarie Street, Sydney]], Lennox met the [[Surveyor General of New South Wales|Surveyor-General]] [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Sir Thomas Mitchell]].<ref name=nswshr-1472/>\n\nThe Surveyor-General lost little time in submitting Lennox's credentials to the [[Governor of New South Wales|Governor]], describing him as \"a very well qualified person recently arrived in the Colony.\" Acting on Mitchell's recommendation, [[Richard Bourke|Governor Bourke]] provisionally appointed Lennox as a Sub-Inspector of Bridges at a salary of [[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]120 per annum. In June 1833 the position was confirmed by London as Superintendent of Bridges.<ref name=nswshr-1472/>\n\nIn 1832, the Surveyor-General at the time, [[Sir Thomas Mitchell]], commissioned Lennox for a sum of A\u00a31,083<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2208948 |title=Votes and Proceedings. |newspaper=[[Sydney Gazette|The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser]] |volume=XXX |issue=2192 |date=11 October 1832 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> to build a bridge at the intersection of Prospect Creek and Southern Street,<ref name = \"rms\"/><ref name=nswshr-1472/> which would replace the nearby \"Bowler's Bridge\" named after Lansdowne's local innkeeper.<ref name=\"ea\">{{cite web|url=https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/portal/system/files/engineering-heritage-australia/nomination-title/Lennoxs_Lansdowne_Bridge_Nomination.pdf|title=Lennox's Lansdowne Bridge|publisher=The Institution of Engineers Australia|date=March 1986|access-date=6 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117033240/https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/portal/system/files/engineering-heritage-australia/nomination-title/Lennoxs_Lansdowne_Bridge_Nomination.pdf|archive-date=17 November 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The sandstone used in designing the bridge was found in a quarry only {{convert|11|km}} from the proposed site of the bridge, allowing workers to row a [[punt (boat)|punt]] to transport the stone to the construction site.<ref name=nswshr-1472/>\n\nIn July 1833 Lennox told Mitchell of a mutiny that had occurred at the quarry while he had been away on an inspection tour. Some of the convicts had rebelled and had consumed the contents of a nearby liquor still. Returning to the camp drunk they threatened to kill the supervisor and destroy the camp and quarrying equipment. The police from [[Liverpool, New South Wales|Liverpool]] were called and arrested the offenders. Retribution at Liverpool Court was swift and savage; those who were spared the chain gang received up to fifty lashes of the \"cat\".<ref name=nswshr-1472/>\n\nOn 1 January 1834, Governor Bourke visited the site of the bridge to lay the foundation stone. Within hours of the laying of the inscription plate it was stolen. Lennox made arrangements to obtain a duplicate plate but the original was found and restored to the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1472/> The [[foundation stone]] was laid on 1 January 1834. The bridge was constructed entirely by unskilled Australian convicts, despite Lennox's numerous requests to Mitchell for skilled labourers.<ref name=\"ea\"/> The bridge was completed a year later in 1835, and opened on 26 January 1836, the 48th anniversary of the [[Colony of New South Wales]], before a crowd of around 1,000.<ref name = \"rms\"/><ref name=\"ea\"/> Later, [[Richard Bourke]], the [[Governor of New South Wales]], wrote that the bridge had cost only A\u00a31,000 to build, compared to the A\u00a37,000 it would have taken to build a bridge of the same quality in England.<ref name=\"ea\"/>\n\nOn 7 June 1834 Lennox applied for more labourers, the bridge being at a stage where the centring could commence. This was the construction of a rigid timber frame to hold each stone in place until the arch became self-supporting. It was a critical process and any inaccuracies would cause instability or collapse the arch.<ref name=nswshr-1472/>\n\nUpon receiving a report that the bridge was nearing completion, Governor Bourke selected 26 January 1836 for the official opening date, as this coincided with the 48th anniversary of the Colony's foundation. The Lansdowne Bridge was not ready for several months as the Toll House was not complete. Once tolls started to be collected however, the bridge soon recovered its cost and in 1844 annual receipts were 685 pounds.<ref name=\"nswshr-1472-2378\">George, 1982</ref><ref name=\"nswshr-1472\" />\n\nIn 1956, the [[Government of New South Wales|New South Wales government]] duplicated the original bridge with a new concrete arch bridge parallel to the existing to carry southbound traffic of the [[Hume Highway]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Roadmakers, A History of Main Roads in New South Wales|last=|first=|publisher=Department of Main Roads|year=|isbn=0 7240 0439 4|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nA large [[sandstone]] arched bridge spanning the Prospect Creek.
