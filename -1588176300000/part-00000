\u03a7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2, 'Golden City'), is a large and densely populated district and municipality of [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]], on the [[Anatolia]]n shore of the

It is bordered on the north by [[Beykoz]], on the east by [[\u00dcmraniye]], on the southeast by [[Ata\u015fehir]], on the south by [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y]], and on the west by the Bosphorus, with the areas of [[Be\u015fikta\u015f]], [[Beyo\u011flu]], and [[Emin\u00f6n\u00fc]] on the opposite shore.<!-- new boundaries of Uskudar http://www.ibb.gov.tr/tr-TR/Pages/Haber.aspx?NewsID=15773 --> It is home to about half a million people. \u00dcsk\u00fcdar is also the usual name for the historic center of the municipality.\n\n==Etymology==\n{{lang|tr|\u00dcsk\u00fcdar|italic=no}} was originally called {{lang|grc-Latn|Skoutarion}} ([[Byzantine Greek]]: {{lang|grc|\u03a3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd}}) during the [[Byzantine Empire]].

It is directly opposite the old city of [[Emin\u00f6n\u00fc]] and transport across the Bosphorus is easy by boat or bridge. So there are well-established communities here, many retired people, and many residents commute to the European side for work or school (being cheap and central \u00dcsk\u00fcdar has a large student population). During the rush-hour, the waterfront is bustling with people running from ferryboats and motorboats onto buses and minibuses. \u00dcsk\u00fcdar also has the smell of the sea, the sound of foghorns, motorboats and seagulls and one of the best views of the city.\n\n[[File:Uskudar Square.jpg|right|thumb|Central \u00dcsk\u00fcdar on a snowy day, with [[Mihrimah Sultan Mosque (\u00dcsk\u00fcdar)|Mihrimah Sultan Mosque]] in the background]]\n{{As of|2006}}, the central square is being dug up for a tunnel under the Bosphorus which will carry an underground railway. However, this is predictably continuously running into artifacts of great archaeological value.\n\nThe area behind the ferry dock is a busy shopping district, with many restaurants (including the well-known ''Kanaat Lokantas\u0131'' serving Ottoman cuisine, [[olive oil]]-based dishes, and ice cream) and a number of important Ottoman mosques (see section below). However, there are relatively few cafes, cinemas, billiard halls, and places for youth to congregate.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nThe private [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar University]], founded by the [[Human Values and Mental Health Foundation]], has a campus here.\n\nUskudar has two public libraries: [[\u015eemsi Pasha Mosque]] Public Library (built in 1953) and Selimiye Public Library.\n\n==Neighborhoods==\n\n[[File:Uskudar fountain.jpg|right|thumb|Sultan [[Ahmet III]] Fountain in \u00dcsk\u00fcdar square]]\n\n\u00dcsk\u00fcdar is a municipality within borders of Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality ({{lang|tr|[[b\u00fcy\u00fck\u015fehir belediyeleri|b\u00fcy\u00fck\u015fehir]]}}). The municipality is subdivided into neighborhoods ({{lang|tr|[[mahalle]]ler}}). The boundaries and names of the official neighborhoods change from time to time and sometimes do not correspond to historically recognized neighborhoods or to residents' own perceptions.\n\nThe most prominent neighborhood is \u00dcsk\u00fcdar's historic center ({{lang|tr|merkez}}), centered on the ferry docks and roughly corresponding to the current Mimar Sinan neighborhood (former Selmana\u011fa, Tembel Hac\u0131 Mehmet, and \u0130nk\u0131lap neighborhoods). This area includes large historic mosques, many businesses and markets, and is a transportation hub.\n\nOther prominent neighborhoods include the former villages on the Bosphorus to the north of the historic center, Kuzguncuk, Beylerbeyi, \u00c7engelk\u00f6y, Kuleli, Vanik\u00f6y (now part of Kandilli), and Kandilli; the neighborhoods along the Bosphorus shore south of the historic center, [[Salacak]], [[Harem, Istanbul|Harem]] (now part of Aziz Mahmud Huday\u0131), and Selimiye; and the mostly residential neighborhoods on the hilltops and hillsides, Do\u011fanc\u0131lar (now mostly part of Aziz Mahmud Huday\u0131), \u0130mrahor (now part of Salacak), Selams\u0131z (now part of Selamiali), Ba\u011flarba\u015f\u0131 (now part of Altunizade), Altunizade, Ac\u0131badem, K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck \u00c7aml\u0131ca, and B\u00fcy\u00fck \u00c7aml\u0131ca (mostly in K\u0131s\u0131kl\u0131, Burhaniye, and Ferah).\n\n===Salacak===\n\u00dcsk\u00fcdar's long promenade along the coast from the center down in southern direction towards the bus station at [[Harem, Istanbul|Harem]] is popular in summer as it commands views of the European shore of [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]], [[Hagia Sophia|Aya Sofya]], [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque]] (The [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque|Blue Mosque]]), [[Taksim Square|Taksim]] and [[Be\u015fikta\u015f]]. This promenade is lined with cafes and restaurants, the most prominent of which is not on the coast but out in the water: the [[Maiden's Tower]] ({{lang|tr|K\u0131z Kulesi}}), a small tower just off the coast that has existed since [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times, when it was called Leander's Tower. From time to time it has been used as a toll booth; now it is used as an upscale restaurant and a venue for wedding parties. The name comes from a legend about a princess shut in the tower.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nOn nice days people gather on the shore to fish, sit and drink tea or to enjoy being out on the water in little rowing boats. There is a more recent mosque (1760) on the shore opposite the tower. The streets of Salacak behind the coast, in the area called ''Imrahor'', are attractive and still hold a number of classic Ottoman wooden houses. The legendary 17th-century [[Hezarfen Ahmet \u00c7elebi]] is said to have landed here on his hang-glider flight across the Bosphorus.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nFurther down along the coast is the Harem neighborhood, which contains a major intercity bus terminal and the [[Selimiye Barracks]], where [[Florence Nightingale]] once tended wounded British soldiers.<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite serial |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/8822/ |title = Cypresses and Road Leading to the Cemetery, Scutari, Constantinople, Turkey |website = [[World Digital Library]]|year = 1890\u20131900|accessdate = 18 October 2013}}</ref> Behind the coast, towards the east, \u00dcsk\u00fcdar climbs steeply into the residential areas uphill, Ba\u011flarba\u015f\u0131 and Do\u011fanc\u0131lar.\n\n===Do\u011fanc\u0131lar===\nA pleasant neighborhood on the hill above Salacak, with plenty of trees between the buildings and a small park. There is a wide avenue winding uphill from \u00dcsk\u00fcdar, which has plenty of shops and cafes, and also a theater (the Musahipzade Celal Sahnesi), the fire station, the former women's prison ([[Pa\u015fakap\u0131s\u0131 Prison]]), Burhan Felek High School and Do\u011fanc\u0131lar mosque (opposite the park).\n\n===Ba\u011flarba\u015f\u0131 and Altunizade===\n[[File:Altunizade Mosque.jpg|thumb|right|[[Altunizade Mosque]]]]\nFormerly orchards and fruit-gardens ({{lang|tr|ba\u011f}}), it became a residential neighborhood in the 19th century, home to the typical Istanbul urban mix of Greeks, Jews, Turks, and Armenians.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The neighborhood still has an Armenian school and the Armenian church of Surp Garabed, built in 1844. Until the 1990s the area remained a middle-class residential neighborhood,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} and today is still an attractive district with a mixture of housing and office/commercial property. A number of properties have been converted to office and business use. Altunizade is still an attractive residential neighborhood, home to the large and busy Capitol shopping and entertainment center. Altunizade was established in the early 19th century by [[Altunizade \u0130smail Z\u00fcht\u00fc Pasha]]. He also commissioned [[Altunizade Mosque]], which was built in 1866.\n\nThere are a number of well-known schools within the district including [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar American Academy]], one of the oldest established schools in the city, \u00dcsk\u00fcdar High School, a state school, Haydarpasha High School, [[Marmara University]]'s faculty of theology; and Burhan Felek sports complex.\n\n===Selams\u0131z===\n[[Selams\u0131z]] is an old residential neighborhood, home to a [[Romani people|Roma]] (Gypsy) community and Roma culture.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\n===Ac\u0131badem===\nThe top half of the attractive district of [[Ac\u0131badem, Kad\u0131k\u00f6y|Ac\u0131badem]] also belongs to \u00dcsk\u00fcdar, including Ac\u0131badem and Academic hospitals. This avenue with its [[patisserie]]s, ice-cream parlors and caf\u00e9s, is the center one of the most pleasant neighborhoods of Istanbul,{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} consisting of tree-lined streets and well-planned housing areas, as well as \u00c7aml\u0131ca Girls\u2019 High School set in a tree-lined garden.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Up the Bosphorus===\nThe boundary of the municipality of \u00dcsk\u00fcdar is far up the Bosphorus, and beyond lies [[Beykoz]]. \u00dcsk\u00fcdar's up-north Bosphorus villages include:\n\n====Pa\u015faliman\u0131====\nJust past \u00dcsk\u00fcdar the coastline is called Pa\u015faliman\u0131. ''Liman'' means \"port\" in Turkish (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|lim\u00e0ni}}, {{lang|el|\u03bb\u03b9\u03bc\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9}}) and boats would moor here. A large stone building on the shore, built as a tobacco warehouse by late-Ottoman architect Vedat Tek, has been completely renovated and now serves as headquarters of [[List of power companies of Turkey|Ciner Grubu]] ([[Ciner Group]]), an industrial conglomerate. There is a small area of parkland right on the shore and the entrance to the large Fetih Pa\u015fa Korusu park is here.\n\n====Kuzguncuk====\nA Bosphorus village of streets with little shops, seaside cafes, and many old-fashioned wooden houses, [[Kuzguncuk]] has a village atmosphere. There is a ferry dock and a little park on the waterfront. The village was called ''Kosinitsa'' in the Byzantine period and until recently the people of Kuzguncuk were the typical Istanbul cosmopolitan mixture of Turks, Greeks, Jews, and Armenians.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} There are very few non-Muslims left today and the area has become an attractive middle-class neighborhood, home to people like film director [[U\u011fur Y\u00fccel]], sculptor [[Kuzgun Acar]], painter [[Acar Ba\u015fkut]] (whose studio is in the village), architects [[Nevzat Sayin]] and [[Cengiz Bekta\u015f]], and the late poet [[Can Y\u00fccel]]. The neighborhood is also portrayed in the novel ''Mediterranean Waltz'' (Kumral Ada Mavi Tuna) by [[Buket Uzuner]].\n\n====Beylerbeyi====\nJust beyond the [[Bosphorus bridge]] is [[Beylerbeyi]], an area known in Istanbul for its fish restaurants, and for the Ottoman palace on the shore. The [[Sabanc\u0131 family]] of Turkish industrialists have sponsored the restoration and building of the school, police station and other public buildings, thus making them appropriate to the many very attractive houses and shops in the village.\n\n====\u00c7engelk\u00f6y====\nFormerly a waterfront village, known for the cucumbers grown in gardens on the green hillsides behind. There are a number of very grand seaside villas ({{lang|tr|[[yal\u0131]]}}). The village has a number of shops, bakeries and waterfront cafes offering gorgeous views of the Bosphorus that tend to be busy, especially at weekends. Since the mid-1990s new housing estates have been built on the hillsides and now there are always queues of traffic through \u00c7engelk\u00f6y. But the village retains some of its romantic charm. The word {{lang|tr|\u00e7engel}} means \"hook\" or \"anchor\" in Turkish, and {{lang|tr|k\u00f6y}} means \"village\"; apparently there were blacksmiths or metalworkers in the village in Ottoman times.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nThe highly prestigious [[Kuleli Military High School]] is on the Bosphorus just beyond \u00c7engelk\u00f6y. Most graduates from here go on to military academy and careers as army officers.\n\n===Inland from the center of \u00dcsk\u00fcdar===\n\n====\u00c7aml\u0131ca====\nThis hill, known as ''Tchamlidja'' in 19th-century spelling, has the highest point in Istanbul and commands a panoramic view of the entire city. One of the most prestiged schools of Turkey, Bilfen College is located on the \u00c7aml\u0131ca hill.\n\n<!-- Ko\u015fuyolu is in fact now part of Kad\u0131k\u00f6y.

In addition, the area has a high concentration of historic buildings and religious sites.\n\n===Parks===\n[[Fethi Pa\u015fa Korusu]] is a large park on the hillside that extends down to the Bosphorus shore, slightly beyond \u00dcsk\u00fcdar in the area called Pa\u015faliman\u0131. It is named after [[Fetih Ahmet Pa\u015fa]] an Ottoman prince who among other things was responsible for industrializing the [[glassworks]] of Ottoman Turkey, and had a home in the area. The parkland is in fact privately owned and let to the state on condition that it is preserved as a park. The owners are the estate of Turkish industrialist [[Nuri Demira\u011f]]. There is a caf\u00e9 in the park, a stone waterfall which children climb on and a small stage area where on Friday evenings in summer a band of amateur musicians give open-air concerts at sunset. At weekends the young lovers of \u00dcsk\u00fcdar gather here to stroll and cuddle in the shade.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Mosques===\n[[File:\u00c7inili Mosque.jpg|right|thumb|\u00c7inili (Tiled) Mosque]]\n[[File:Namazg\u00e2h Mosque.jpg|right|thumb|The wooden [[Namazg\u00e2h Mosque]]]]\n\u00dcsk\u00fcdar is home to over 180 mosques,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.uskudarmuftulugu.gov.tr/index.php?makaleid=77 |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 August 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008104913/http://www.uskudarmuftulugu.gov.tr/index.php?makaleid=77 |archive-date=2011-10-08 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> many of them historic Ottoman buildings, many built for women of the imperial harem, and many built by the architect [[Mimar Sinan]].

It is directly opposite the old city of [[Emin\u00f6n\u00fc]] and transport across the Bosphorus is easy by boat or bridge. So there are well-established communities here, many retired people, and many residents commute to the European side for work or school (being cheap and central \u00dcsk\u00fcdar has a large student population). During the rush-hour, the waterfront is bustling with people running from ferryboats and motorboats onto buses and minibuses. \u00dcsk\u00fcdar also has the smell of the sea, the sound of foghorns, motorboats and seagulls and one of the best views of the city.\n\n[[File:Uskudar Square.jpg|right|thumb|Central \u00dcsk\u00fcdar on a snowy day, with [[Mihrimah Sultan Mosque (\u00dcsk\u00fcdar)|Mihrimah Sultan Mosque]] in the background]]\n{{As of|2006}}, the central square is being dug up for a tunnel under the Bosphorus which will carry an underground railway. However, this is predictably continuously running into artifacts of great archaeological value.\n\nThe area behind the ferry dock is a busy shopping district, with many restaurants (including the well-known ''Kanaat Lokantas\u0131'' serving Ottoman cuisine, [[olive oil]]-based dishes, and ice cream) and a number of important Ottoman mosques (see section below). However, there are relatively few cafes, cinemas, billiard halls, and places for youth to congregate.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nThe private [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar University]], founded by the [[Human Values and Mental Health Foundation]], has a campus here.\n\nUskudar has two public libraries: [[\u015eemsi Pasha Mosque]] Public Library (built in 1953) and Selimiye Public Library.\n\n==Neighborhoods==\n\n[[File:Uskudar fountain.jpg|right|thumb|Sultan [[Ahmet III]] Fountain in \u00dcsk\u00fcdar square]]\n\n\u00dcsk\u00fcdar is a municipality within borders of Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality ({{lang|tr|[[b\u00fcy\u00fck\u015fehir belediyeleri|b\u00fcy\u00fck\u015fehir]]}}). The municipality is subdivided into neighborhoods ({{lang|tr|[[mahalle]]ler}}). The boundaries and names of the official neighborhoods change from time to time and sometimes do not correspond to historically recognized neighborhoods or to residents' own perceptions.\n\nThe most prominent neighborhood is \u00dcsk\u00fcdar's historic center ({{lang|tr|merkez}}), centered on the ferry docks and roughly corresponding to the current Mimar Sinan neighborhood (former Selmana\u011fa, Tembel Hac\u0131 Mehmet, and \u0130nk\u0131lap neighborhoods). This area includes large historic mosques, many businesses and markets, and is a transportation hub.\n\nOther prominent neighborhoods include the former villages on the Bosphorus to the north of the historic center, Kuzguncuk, Beylerbeyi, \u00c7engelk\u00f6y, Kuleli, Vanik\u00f6y (now part of Kandilli), and Kandilli; the neighborhoods along the Bosphorus shore south of the historic center, [[Salacak]], [[Harem, Istanbul|Harem]] (now part of Aziz Mahmud Huday\u0131), and Selimiye; and the mostly residential neighborhoods on the hilltops and hillsides, Do\u011fanc\u0131lar (now mostly part of Aziz Mahmud Huday\u0131), \u0130mrahor (now part of Salacak), Selams\u0131z (now part of Selamiali), Ba\u011flarba\u015f\u0131 (now part of Altunizade), Altunizade, Ac\u0131badem, K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck \u00c7aml\u0131ca, and B\u00fcy\u00fck \u00c7aml\u0131ca (mostly in K\u0131s\u0131kl\u0131, Burhaniye, and Ferah).\n\n===Salacak===\n\u00dcsk\u00fcdar's long promenade along the coast from the center down in southern direction towards the bus station at [[Harem, Istanbul|Harem]] is popular in summer as it commands views of the European shore of [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]], [[Hagia Sophia|Aya Sofya]], [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque]] (The [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque|Blue Mosque]]), [[Taksim Square|Taksim]] and [[Be\u015fikta\u015f]]. This promenade is lined with cafes and restaurants, the most prominent of which is not on the coast but out in the water: the [[Maiden's Tower]] ({{lang|tr|K\u0131z Kulesi}}), a small tower just off the coast that has existed since [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times, when it was called Leander's Tower. From time to time it has been used as a toll booth; now it is used as an upscale restaurant and a venue for wedding parties. The name comes from a legend about a princess shut in the tower.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nOn nice days people gather on the shore to fish, sit and drink tea or to enjoy being out on the water in little rowing boats. There is a more recent mosque (1760) on the shore opposite the tower. The streets of Salacak behind the coast, in the area called ''Imrahor'', are attractive and still hold a number of classic Ottoman wooden houses. The legendary 17th-century [[Hezarfen Ahmet \u00c7elebi]] is said to have landed here on his hang-glider flight across the Bosphorus.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nFurther down along the coast is the Harem neighborhood, which contains a major intercity bus terminal and the [[Selimiye Barracks]], where [[Florence Nightingale]] once tended wounded British soldiers.<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite serial |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/8822/ |title = Cypresses and Road Leading to the Cemetery, Scutari, Constantinople, Turkey |website = [[World Digital Library]]|year = 1890\u20131900|accessdate = 18 October 2013}}</ref> Behind the coast, towards the east, \u00dcsk\u00fcdar climbs steeply into the residential areas uphill, Ba\u011flarba\u015f\u0131 and Do\u011fanc\u0131lar.\n\n===Do\u011fanc\u0131lar===\nA pleasant neighborhood on the hill above Salacak, with plenty of trees between the buildings and a small park. There is a wide avenue winding uphill from \u00dcsk\u00fcdar, which has plenty of shops and cafes, and also a theater (the Musahipzade Celal Sahnesi), the fire station, the former women's prison ([[Pa\u015fakap\u0131s\u0131 Prison]]), Burhan Felek High School and Do\u011fanc\u0131lar mosque (opposite the park).\n\n===Ba\u011flarba\u015f\u0131 and Altunizade===\n[[File:Altunizade Mosque.jpg|thumb|right|[[Altunizade Mosque]]]]\nFormerly orchards and fruit-gardens ({{lang|tr|ba\u011f}}), it became a residential neighborhood in the 19th century, home to the typical Istanbul urban mix of Greeks, Jews, Turks, and Armenians.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The neighborhood still has an Armenian school and the Armenian church of Surp Garabed, built in 1844. Until the 1990s the area remained a middle-class residential neighborhood,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} and today is still an attractive district with a mixture of housing and office/commercial property. A number of properties have been converted to office and business use. Altunizade is still an attractive residential neighborhood, home to the large and busy Capitol shopping and entertainment center. Altunizade was established in the early 19th century by [[Altunizade \u0130smail Z\u00fcht\u00fc Pasha]]. He also commissioned [[Altunizade Mosque]], which was built in 1866.\n\nThere are a number of well-known schools within the district including [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar American Academy]], one of the oldest established schools in the city, \u00dcsk\u00fcdar High School, a state school, Haydarpasha High School, [[Marmara University]]'s faculty of theology; and Burhan Felek sports complex.\n\n===Selams\u0131z===\n[[Selams\u0131z]] is an old residential neighborhood, home to a [[Romani people|Roma]] (Gypsy) community and Roma culture.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\n===Ac\u0131badem===\nThe top half of the attractive district of [[Ac\u0131badem, Kad\u0131k\u00f6y|Ac\u0131badem]] also belongs to \u00dcsk\u00fcdar, including Ac\u0131badem and Academic hospitals. This avenue with its [[patisserie]]s, ice-cream parlors and caf\u00e9s, is the center one of the most pleasant neighborhoods of Istanbul,{{fact|date=March 2019}} consisting of tree-lined streets and well-planned housing areas, as well as \u00c7aml\u0131ca Girls\u2019 High School set in a tree-lined garden.{{fact|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Up the Bosphorus===\nThe boundary of the municipality of \u00dcsk\u00fcdar is far up the Bosphorus, and beyond lies [[Beykoz]]. \u00dcsk\u00fcdar's up-north Bosphorus villages include:\n\n====Pa\u015faliman\u0131====\nJust past \u00dcsk\u00fcdar the coastline is called Pa\u015faliman\u0131. ''Liman'' means \"port\" in Turkish (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|lim\u00e0ni}}, {{lang|el|\u03bb\u03b9\u03bc\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9}}) and boats would moor here. A large stone building on the shore, built as a tobacco warehouse by late-Ottoman architect Vedat Tek, has been completely renovated and now serves as headquarters of [[List of power companies of Turkey|Ciner Grubu]] ([[Ciner Group]]), an industrial conglomerate. There is a small area of parkland right on the shore and the entrance to the large Fetih Pa\u015fa Korusu park is here.\n\n====Kuzguncuk====\nA Bosphorus village of streets with little shops, seaside cafes, and many old-fashioned wooden houses, [[Kuzguncuk]] has a village atmosphere. There is a ferry dock and a little park on the waterfront. The village was called ''Kosinitsa'' in the Byzantine period and until recently the people of Kuzguncuk were the typical Istanbul cosmopolitan mixture of Turks, Greeks, Jews, and Armenians.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} There are very few non-Muslims left today and the area has become an attractive middle-class neighborhood, home to people like film director [[U\u011fur Y\u00fccel]], sculptor [[Kuzgun Acar]], painter [[Acar Ba\u015fkut]] (whose studio is in the village), architects [[Nevzat Sayin]] and [[Cengiz Bekta\u015f]], and the late poet [[Can Y\u00fccel]]. The neighborhood is also portrayed in the novel ''Mediterranean Waltz'' (Kumral Ada Mavi Tuna) by [[Buket Uzuner]].\n\n====Beylerbeyi====\nJust beyond the [[Bosphorus bridge]] is [[Beylerbeyi]], an area known in Istanbul for its fish restaurants, and for the Ottoman palace on the shore. The [[Sabanc\u0131 family]] of Turkish industrialists have sponsored the restoration and building of the school, police station and other public buildings, thus making them appropriate to the many very attractive houses and shops in the village.\n\n====\u00c7engelk\u00f6y====\nFormerly a waterfront village, known for the cucumbers grown in gardens on the green hillsides behind. There are a number of very grand seaside villas ({{lang|tr|[[yal\u0131]]}}). The village has a number of shops, bakeries and waterfront cafes offering gorgeous views of the Bosphorus that tend to be busy, especially at weekends. Since the mid-1990s new housing estates have been built on the hillsides and now there are always queues of traffic through \u00c7engelk\u00f6y. But the village retains some of its romantic charm. The word {{lang|tr|\u00e7engel}} means \"hook\" or \"anchor\" in Turkish, and {{lang|tr|k\u00f6y}} means \"village\"; apparently there were blacksmiths or metalworkers in the village in Ottoman times.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nThe highly prestigious [[Kuleli Military High School]] is on the Bosphorus just beyond \u00c7engelk\u00f6y. Most graduates from here go on to military academy and careers as army officers.\n\n===Inland from the center of \u00dcsk\u00fcdar===\n\n====\u00c7aml\u0131ca====\nThis hill, known as ''Tchamlidja'' in 19th-century spelling, has the highest point in Istanbul and commands a panoramic view of the entire city. One of the most prestiged schools of Turkey, Bilfen College is located on the \u00c7aml\u0131ca hill.\n\n<!-- Ko\u015fuyolu is in fact now part of Kad\u0131k\u00f6y. Was it once part of \u00dcsk\u00fcdar?\n====Ko\u015fuyolu====\nA quiet residential district, with some well-known hospitals in parkland going back to the Ottoman period.-->\n\n==Sights of \u00dcsk\u00fcdar==\n[[File:Yeni Valide Mosque-2.jpg|thumb| [[Yeni Valide Camii]], the \"New Mosque\" of the [[mother sultan]]]]\n\nThough densely populated, \u00dcsk\u00fcdar has many areas of greenery, including the \u00c7aml\u0131ca hills, the Bosphorus coastline, and various parks. In addition, the area has a high concentration of historic buildings and religious sites.\n\n===Parks===\n[[Fethi Pa\u015fa Korusu]] is a large park on the hillside that extends down to the Bosphorus shore, slightly beyond \u00dcsk\u00fcdar in the area called Pa\u015faliman\u0131. It is named after [[Fetih Ahmet Pa\u015fa]] an Ottoman prince who among other things was responsible for industrializing the [[glassworks]] of Ottoman Turkey, and had a home in the area. The parkland is in fact privately owned and let to the state on condition that it is preserved as a park. The owners are the estate of Turkish industrialist [[Nuri Demira\u011f]]. There is a caf\u00e9 in the park, a stone waterfall which children climb on and a small stage area where on Friday evenings in summer a band of amateur musicians give open-air concerts at sunset. At weekends the young lovers of \u00dcsk\u00fcdar gather here to stroll and cuddle in the shade.{{fact|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Mosques===\n[[File:\u00c7inili Mosque.jpg|right|thumb|\u00c7inili (Tiled) Mosque]]\n[[File:Namazg\u00e2h Mosque.jpg|right|thumb|The wooden [[Namazg\u00e2h Mosque]]]]\n\u00dcsk\u00fcdar is home to over 180 mosques,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.uskudarmuftulugu.gov.tr/index.php?makaleid=77 |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 August 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008104913/http://www.uskudarmuftulugu.gov.tr/index.php?makaleid=77 |archive-date=2011-10-08 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> many of them historic Ottoman buildings, many built for women of the imperial harem, and many built by the architect [[Mimar Sinan]].

However, in October, it was confirmed that she was still unable to return to Lebanon due to the war, and US medical schools had begun their fall term 2 months earlier. Her family friends in America suggested she apply to [[Vanderbilt University]].  Vanderbilt did not accept transfer students, but recommended [[Meharry Medical College]] instead; Meharry accepted her on the spot.<ref name=\"jci\"/> Despite her continued desire to return to Lebanon the next summer, on the advice of professors at AUB, she stayed at Meharry and earned an [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] degree in 1979, after which she joined the [[Texas Children's Hospital]] at the [[Baylor College of Medicine]] as a [[pediatrics|pediatric]] resident.<ref name=\"pnas\"/>\n\nZoghbi initially intended to specialise in pediatric [[cardiology]], out of an interest in the heart. During her rotation at pediatric [[neurology]], Marvin Fishman, the head of the division, convinced her that the [[brain]] was more interesting than the heart. She thus started a 3-year term as a [[postdoctoral researcher]] in pediatric neurology after she finished her residency in 1982.\n\n== Career ==\nFrom 1982 to 1985, Zoghbi was a [[postdoctoral researcher]] in pediatric neurology at the [[Baylor College of Medicine]].

The paper allowed Zoghbi to diagnose a five-year-old she treated at [[Texas Children's Hospital]], and a week later she saw another patient with the same set of symptoms. When she investigated medical records, she found more cases of Rett syndrome that had been misdiagnosed.

However, in October, it was confirmed that she was still unable to return to Lebanon due to the war, and US medical schools had begun their fall term 2 months earlier. Her family friends in America suggested she apply to [[Vanderbilt University]].  Vanderbilt did not accept transfer students, but recommended [[Meharry Medical College]] instead; Meharry accepted her on the spot.<ref name=\"jci\"/> Despite her continued desire to return to Lebanon the next summer, on the advice of professors at AUB, she stayed at Meharry and earned an [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] degree in 1979, after which she joined the [[Texas Children's Hospital]] at the [[Baylor College of Medicine]] as a [[pediatrics|pediatric]] resident.<ref name=\"pnas\"/>\n\nZoghbi initially intended to specialise in pediatric [[cardiology]], out of an interest in the heart. During her rotation at pediatric [[neurology]], Marvin Fishman, the head of the division, convinced her that the [[brain]] was more interesting than the heart. She thus started a 3-year term as a [[postdoctoral researcher]] in pediatric neurology after she finished her residency in 1982.\n\n== Career ==\nFrom 1982 to 1985, Zoghbi was a [[postdoctoral researcher]] in pediatric neurology at the [[Baylor College of Medicine]].

The paper allowed Zoghbi to diagnose a five-year-old she treated at [[Texas Children's Hospital]], and a week later she saw another patient with the same set of symptoms.

Schaya Iangar, a Madras University Professor, taken in the 1860s by a photographer from the [[Government College of Fine Arts, Chennai|Madras School of Industrial Arts]]]]\nThe first ever demand for higher education in [[Madras Presidency]] was given in a public address to [[John Elphinstone, 13th Lord Elphinstone|Lord John Elphinstone]], Governor of Madras, signed by 70,000 residents when the Governor in Council was contemplating \"some effective and liberal measures for the establishment of an improved system of national education.\" This public petition, which was presented by the Advocate General Mr. George Norton on 11 November 1839, pressed the need for an English college in the city of Madras. Pursuant to this, Lord Elphinstone evolved a plan for the establishment of a central collegiate institution or a \u2018university.\u2019 This university had twin departments&nbsp;\u2013 a high school for the cultivation of English literature, regional language, philosophy and science, and a college for instruction in the higher branches of literature, philosophy and science.\n\nThe University Board was constituted in January 1840 with Mr. George Norton as its president. This was the precursor of the present [[Presidency College, Chennai]]. A systematic educational policy for India was formulated 14 years later by [[Wood's despatch]], which pointed out the rationale for \"creating a properly articulated system of education from the primary school to the University.\" The Dispatch recommended the establishment in the universities of Professorships \"for the purposes of the delivery of lectures in various branches of learning including vernacular as well as classical languages.\" As a result, the University of Madras, organised on the model of the University of London, was incorporated on 5 September 1857 by an Act of the [[Council of India|Legislative Council of India]].\n\nThe university progressed and expanded through the 19th century to span the whole of [[South India]], giving birth to universities like [[Mysore University]] (1916), [[Osmania University]] (1918), [[Andhra University]] (1926), [[Annamalai University]] (1929), [[University of Kerala|Travancore University]] (1937) presently [[University of Kerala]], [[Sri Venkateswara University]] (1954), [[Madurai Kamaraj University]] (1966), [[Bharathidasan University]] (1982), [[Bharathiar University]] (1982), [[Manonmaniam Sundaranar University]] (1990), [[Tamil Nadu Agricultural University]] (1971), [[Anna University]] (1978), [[Tamil University]] (1981), [[Mother Teresa Women's University]] (1984), [[The Tamil Nadu Dr. M.G.R. Medical University|Dr. M.G.R.

In that year the university had 17 departments, 30 teachers, and 69 research scholars. Later the research and teaching functions of the university were encouraged by the [[Sadler Commission]] and the gains of the University were consolidated by the enactment of the ''Madras University Act'' of 1923. About this time, the territorial ambit of the Madras University encompassed from [[Berhampur]] of Odisha in the North East, [[Trivandrum]] of Kerala in the South West, [[Bangalore]] and [[Mangalore]] of Karnataka in the West and [[Hyderabad]] of Andhra Pradesh in the North.\n\nBetween 1926 and 1939, the university published the comprehensive ''[[Tamil Lexicon]]'' dictionary, which is the first among the dictionaries published in any Indian language.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = Kolappan \n  | first = B. \n  | title = Delay, howlers in Tamil Lexicon embarrass scholars \n  | newspaper = The Hindu\n  | location = Chennai\n  | pages = \n  | language = \n  | date = 22 June 2014 \n  | url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/delay-howlers-in-tamil-lexicon-embarrass-scholars/article6138747.ece\n  | accessdate = 25 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Coat of arms==\n[[File:University of Madras Entrance Arch at Chepauk Campus.JPG|thumb|University of Madras Entrance Arch at Chepauk Campus]]\nThe description of the [[Coat of Arms]] of the university, designed in 1857, is:\n<blockquote>\n\"Argent ''(silver or white)'' on a Mount issuant from the basement a Tiger passant proper ''(walking and coloured naturally)'', on a Chief Sable ''(black across the top)'', a Pale Or ''(a gold or yellow vertical strip down the centre 1/3 of the top or chief)'', thereon, between two Elephants heads couped of the field, a lotus flower leaved and slipped of the third, together with this motto ''Doctrina Vim Promovet Insitam''\".\n</blockquote>\nThe coat of arms colours are: the base is light green, the tiger is yellow on a white background, the elephant is grey on a black background, the lotus is a white flower with olive green leaves, on a gold background. The motto scroll is edged red, with black lettering. The English translation of the motto of the University of Madras is: \"Learning promotes natural talent.\"\n\n==Senate House==\n{{See also|Senate House (University of Madras)}}\nThe University of Madras has a historical monument&nbsp;\u2013 [[Senate House (University of Madras)|Senate House]]&nbsp;\u2013 which is one of the landmarks of the city of Chennai. The Senate House, the University's first building, inaugurated in the year 1879, is a masterpiece of [[Robert Fellowes Chisholm]], an architect of the 19th century, who blended the Indo-Saracenic style with Byzantine and European architectural features. The university renovated the Senate House in 2006.\n\n==Campuses and constituent colleges ==\n[[File:Senate Hall, Chepauk.jpg|thumb|The Senate House]]\n[[File:3 Madras University.JPG|thumb|University centenary auditorium]]\nThe university is spread over six campuses, namely, [[Chepauk]], [[Marina Beach|Marina]], [[Guindy]], [[Taramani]], [[Chetput (Chennai)|Chetput]] and [[Maduravoyal]]. The ''Chepauk'' campus of the university houses the VC's secretariat, central library, clock tower, centenary auditorium and the historic [[Senate House (University of Madras)|Senate House]]. The oriental and Indian languages departments are located in the ''Marina'' campus. The ''Guindy'' campus incorporates the natural sciences departments while the campus at ''Taramani'' houses the school of basic medical sciences.

Schaya Iangar, a Madras University Professor, taken in the 1860s by a photographer from the [[Government College of Fine Arts, Chennai|Madras School of Industrial Arts]]]]\nThe first ever demand for higher education in [[Madras Presidency]] was given in a public address to [[John Elphinstone, 13th Lord Elphinstone|Lord John Elphinstone]], Governor of Madras, signed by 70,000 residents when the Governor in Council was contemplating \"some effective and liberal measures for the establishment of an improved system of national education.\" This public petition, which was presented by the Advocate General Mr. George Norton on 11 November 1839, pressed the need for an English college in the city of Madras. Pursuant to this, Lord Elphinstone evolved a plan for the establishment of a central collegiate institution or a \u2018university.\u2019 This university had twin departments&nbsp;\u2013 a high school for the cultivation of English literature, regional language, philosophy and science, and a college for instruction in the higher branches of literature, philosophy and science.\n\nThe University Board was constituted in January 1840 with Mr. George Norton as its president. This was the precursor of the present [[Presidency College, Chennai]]. A systematic educational policy for India was formulated 14 years later by [[Wood's despatch]], which pointed out the rationale for \"creating a properly articulated system of education from the primary school to the University.\" The Dispatch recommended the establishment in the universities of Professorships \"for the purposes of the delivery of lectures in various branches of learning including vernacular as well as classical languages.\" As a result, the University of Madras, organised on the model of the University of London, was incorporated on 5 September 1857 by an Act of the [[Council of India|Legislative Council of India]].\n\nThe university progressed and expanded through the 19th century to span the whole of [[South India]], giving birth to universities like [[Mysore University]] (1916), [[Osmania University]] (1918), [[Andhra University]] (1926), [[Annamalai University]] (1929), [[University of Kerala|Travancore University]] (1937) presently [[University of Kerala]], [[Sri Venkateswara University]] (1954), [[Madurai Kamaraj University]] (1966), [[Bharathidasan University]] (1982), [[Bharathiar University]] (1982), [[Manonmaniam Sundaranar University]] (1990), [[Tamil Nadu Agricultural University]] (1971), [[Anna University]] (1978), [[Tamil University]] (1981), [[Mother Teresa Women's University]] (1984), [[The Tamil Nadu Dr. M.G.R. Medical University|Dr. M.G.R. Medical University]] (1989), [[Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University|Veterinary and Animal Sciences University]] (1989), [[Periyar University]] (1997) and [[Tamil Nadu Dr. Ambedkar Law University|Dr. Ambedkar Law University]] (1996).\n\nIn 1912 endowments were made to the university to establish departments of Indian History, Archaeology, Comparative Philology and Indian Economics. In that year the university had 17 departments, 30 teachers, and 69 research scholars. Later the research and teaching functions of the university were encouraged by the [[Sadler Commission]] and the gains of the University were consolidated by the enactment of the ''Madras University Act'' of 1923. About this time, the territorial ambit of the Madras University encompassed from [[Berhampur]] of Odisha in the North East, [[Trivandrum]] of Kerala in the South West, [[Bangalore]] and [[Mangalore]] of Karnataka in the West and [[Hyderabad]] of Andhra Pradesh in the North.\n\nBetween 1926 and 1939, the university published the comprehensive ''[[Tamil Lexicon]]'' dictionary, which is the first among the dictionaries published in any Indian language.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = Kolappan \n  | first = B. \n  | title = Delay, howlers in Tamil Lexicon embarrass scholars \n  | newspaper = The Hindu\n  | location = Chennai\n  | pages = \n  | language = \n  | date = 22 June 2014 \n  | url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/delay-howlers-in-tamil-lexicon-embarrass-scholars/article6138747.ece\n  | accessdate = 25 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Coat of arms==\n[[File:University of Madras Entrance Arch at Chepauk Campus.JPG|thumb|University of Madras Entrance Arch at Chepauk Campus]]\nThe description of the [[Coat of Arms]] of the university, designed in 1857, is:\n<blockquote>\n\"Argent ''(silver or white)'' on a Mount issuant from the basement a Tiger passant proper ''(walking and coloured naturally)'', on a Chief Sable ''(black across the top)'', a Pale Or ''(a gold or yellow vertical strip down the centre 1/3 of the top or chief)'', thereon, between two Elephants heads couped of the field, a lotus flower leaved and slipped of the third, together with this motto ''Doctrina Vim Promovet Insitam''\".\n</blockquote>\nThe coat of arms colours are: the base is light green, the tiger is yellow on a white background, the elephant is grey on a black background, the lotus is a white flower with olive green leaves, on a gold background. The motto scroll is edged red, with black lettering. The English translation of the motto of the University of Madras is: \"Learning promotes natural talent.\"\n\n==Senate House==\n{{See also|Senate House (University of Madras)}}\nThe University of Madras has a historical monument&nbsp;\u2013 [[Senate House (University of Madras)|Senate House]]&nbsp;\u2013 which is one of the landmarks of the city of Chennai. The Senate House, the University's first building, inaugurated in the year 1879, is a masterpiece of [[Robert Fellowes Chisholm]], an architect of the 19th century, who blended the Indo-Saracenic style with Byzantine and European architectural features. The university renovated the Senate House in 2006.\n\n==Campuses and constituent colleges ==\n[[File:Senate Hall, Chepauk.jpg|thumb|The Senate House]]\n[[File:3 Madras University.JPG|thumb|University centenary auditorium]]\nThe university is spread over six campuses, namely, [[Chepauk]], [[Marina Beach|Marina]], [[Guindy]], [[Taramani]], [[Chetput (Chennai)|Chetput]] and [[Maduravoyal]]. The ''Chepauk'' campus of the university houses the VC's secretariat, central library, clock tower, centenary auditorium and the historic [[Senate House (University of Madras)|Senate House]]. The oriental and Indian languages departments are located in the ''Marina'' campus. The ''Guindy'' campus incorporates the natural sciences departments while the campus at ''Taramani'' houses the school of basic medical sciences. The sports union and the botanical garden are based in ''Chetpet'' and ''Maduravoyal'' campus respectively. The university has two [[constituent college]], in [[Nemmeli]] and [[Thiruvottiyur]], offerings courses in arts and science.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://agro.unom.ac.in/|title=Agro Economic Research centre|accessdate=21 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Madras University Library System==\nThe library system of the university comprises four central libraries located at its Chepauk, Marina, Guindy and Taramani campus.<ref>https://www.unom.ac.in/index.php?route=library/library</ref> Besides, many of the departments and centres have their own library collections.

Soon, Holy Roman Imperial forces joined the battle and conquered the members of the [[Schmalkaldic League]], oppressing and exiling many German Lutherans as they enforced the terms of the [[Augsburg Interim]]. Religious freedom in some areas was secured for Lutherans through the [[Peace of Passau]] in 1552, and under the legal principle of ''[[Cuius regio, eius religio]]'' (the religion of the ruler was to dictate the religion of those ruled) and the [[Declaratio Ferdinandei]] (limited religious tolerance) clauses of the [[Peace of Augsburg]] in 1555.<ref>Fuerbringer, L., ''[https://archive.org/details/concordiacyclope009499mbp Concordia Cyclopedia]'' [[Concordia Publishing House]]. 1927. p. 425</ref>\n[[File:Toleranzbethaus Fresach, copy Hundskirche in der Kreuzen.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|alt=|A Hundskirche replica]]\n\nReligious disputes between the [[Crypto-Calvinism|Crypto-Calvinists]], [[Philippists]], [[Sacramentarians]], [[Ubiquitarians]] and [[Gnesio-Lutherans]] raged within Lutheranism during the middle of the 16th century. This finally ended with the resolution of the issues in the ''[[Formula of Concord]]''. Large numbers of politically and religiously influential leaders met together, debated, and resolved these topics on the basis of Scripture, resulting in the Formula, which over 8,000 leaders signed. The ''[[Book of Concord]]'' replaced earlier, incomplete [[Body of Doctrine|collections of doctrine]], unifying all German Lutherans with identical doctrine and beginning the period of Lutheran Orthodoxy.\n\nIn lands where Catholicism was the state religion, Lutheranism was officially illegal, although enforcement varied. Until the end of the [[Counter-Reformation#Politics|Counter-Reformation]], some Lutherans worshipped secretly, such as at the Hundskirke (which translates as dog church or dog altar). It is a triangle-shaped [[Mass rock|Communion rock]] in a ditch between crosses in [[Paternion]], Austria. The crowned serpent is possibly an allusion to [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor]], while the dog possibly refers to [[Peter Canisius]]. Another figure interpreted as a snail carrying a church tower is possibly a metaphor for the Protestant church.

As Lutherans and Orthodox we affirm that the teachings of the ecumenical councils are authoritative for our churches....The Seventh Ecumenical Council, the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, which rejected iconoclasm and restored the veneration of icons in the churches, was not part of the tradition received by the Reformation. Lutherans, however, rejected the iconoclasm of the 16th century, and affirmed the distinction between adoration due to the Triune God alone and all other forms of veneration (CA 21). Through historical research this council has become better known.  Nevertheless it does not have the same significance for Lutherans as it does for the Orthodox. Yet, Lutherans and Orthodox are in agreement that the Second Council of Nicaea confirms the christological teaching of the earlier councils and in setting forth the role of images (icons) in the lives of the faithful reaffirms the reality of the incarnation of the eternal Word of God, when it states: \"The more frequently, Christ, Mary, the mother of God, and the saints are seen, the more are those who see them drawn to remember and long for those who serve as models, and to pay these icons the tribute of salutation and respectful veneration. Certainly this is not the full adoration in accordance with our faith, which is properly paid only to the divine nature, but it resembles that given to the figure of the honored and life-giving cross, and also to the holy books of the gospels and to other sacred objects\" (Definition of the Second Council of Nicaea).}}</ref><ref name=\"Kelly2009\">{{cite book|title=Ecumenical Council|publisher=Titi Tudorancea Encyclopedia|year=1991\u20132016|url=https://www.tititudorancea.net/z/ecumenical_council.htm|quote=The Lutheran World Federation, in ecumenical dialogues with the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople has affirmed all of the first seven councils as ecumenical and authoritative.}}</ref> The ''[[Augsburg Confession]]'' teaches that \"the faith as confessed by Luther and his followers is nothing new, but the true catholic faith, and that their churches represent the true catholic or universal church\".<ref name=\"Ludwig2016\">{{cite magazine|title=Luther's Catholic Reformation|last=Ludwig|first=Alan|date=12 September 2016|magazine=The Lutheran Witness|language=English|quote=When the Lutherans presented the ''Augsburg Confession'' before Emperor Charles V in 1530, they carefully showed that each article of faith and practice was true first of all to Holy Scripture, and then also to the teaching of the church fathers and the councils and even the canon law of the Church of Rome.

Martin Luther was a great fan of music, and this is why it forms a large part of Lutheran services; in particular, Luther admired the composers [[Josquin des Prez]] and [[Ludwig Senfl]] and wanted singing in the church to move away from the ''ars perfecta'' (Catholic Sacred Music of the late Renaissance) and towards singing as a ''[[Gemeinschaft]]'' (community).<ref>Taruskin, Richard.

Lutherans believe that the actual body and blood of Jesus Christ are present in, with and under the bread and the wine. This belief is called [[Real Presence]] or [[sacramental union]] and is different from [[consubstantiation]] and [[transubstantiation]]. Additionally Lutherans reject the idea that communion is a mere symbol or [[Memorialism|memorial]]. They confess in the ''[[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]]'':\n<blockquote>[W]e do not abolish the Mass but religiously keep and defend it. Among us the Mass is celebrated every Lord's Day and on other [[s:Augsburg Confession#Article XV: Of Ecclesiastical Usages.|festivals]], when the Sacrament is made available to those who wish to partake of it, after they have been examined and absolved. We also keep traditional liturgical forms, such as the order of readings, prayers, vestments, and other similar things.<ref>''Apology of the Augsburg Confession'', Article XXIV.1</ref></blockquote>Besides the Holy Communion (Divine Service), congregations also hold offices, which are worship services without communion. They may include [[Matins in Lutheranism|Matins]], [[Vespers in Lutheranism|Vespers]], [[Compline]], and [[Easter Vigil#Lutheran churches|Easter Vigil]].

Often they were held alongside a traditional service in order to cater to those who preferred [[contemporary worship music]]. Today, few but some Lutheran congregations have contemporary worship as their sole form of worship.

Prior to this time, the two Lutheran church bodies in Australia ([[History of the Lutheran Church of Australia#Merge of UELCA and ELCA into the Lutheran Church of Australia|which merged in 1966]]) used a bewildering variety of hymnals, usually in the German language.

They condemned the Philippist position for [[indifferentism]], describing it as a \"unionistic compromise\" of precious Reformation theology. Instead, they held that genuine unity between Christians and real theological peace was only possible with an honest agreement about every subject of doctrinal controversy.<ref>Klug, Eugene F. and Stahlke, Otto F.

As part of [[denazification]] the Reich Church was formally done away with in 1945, and certain clergy were removed from their positions. However, the merger between the Lutheran, United, and Reformed state churches was retained under the name [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] (EKD). In 1948 the Lutheran church bodies within the EKD founded the [[United Evangelical Lutheran Church of Germany]] (VELKD), but it has since been reduced from being an independent legal entity to an administrative unit within the EKD.\n\nPresently, Lutherans are divided over how to interact with other Christian denominations. Some Lutherans assert that everyone must share the \"whole counsel of God\" (Acts 20:27) in complete unity (1 Cor. 1:10)<ref>For a historical example, see Robert Preus, ''To Join or Not To Join''.

These organizations together account for the great majority of Lutheran denominations. The [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod|LCMS]] and the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Canada]] are members of the ILC. The [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod|WELS]] and [[Evangelical Lutheran Synod|ELS]] are members of the CELC. Many Lutheran churches are not affiliated with the LWF, the ILC or the CELC: The congregations of the [[Church of the Lutheran Confession]] (CLC) are affiliated with their mission organizations in Canada, India, Nepal, Myanmar, and many African nations; and those affiliated with the [[Church of the Lutheran Brethren]] are especially active doing mission work in Africa and East Asia.\n\nThe Lutheran World Federation-aligned churches do not believe that one church is singularly true in its teachings. According to this belief, Lutheranism is a reform movement rather than a movement into doctrinal correctness. As part of this, in 1999 the LWF and the Roman Catholic Church jointly issued a statement, the ''[[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]]'', that stated that the LWF and the Catholics both agreed about certain basics of Justification and lifted certain Catholic [[anathema]]s formerly applying to the LWF member churches.{{Citation needed span|The LCMS has participated in most of the [[Lutheran-Roman Catholic dialogue|official dialogues with the Roman Catholic Church]] since shortly after the [[Second Vatican Council]], though not the one which produced the ''Joint Declaration'' and to which they were not invited.

As of 2019, the Forum is not a full communion organization. Similar in this structure is the [[International Lutheran Council]], where issues of communion are left to the individual denominations. Not all ILC churches have declared church-fellowship with each other. In contrast, mutual church-fellowship is part of the CELC member churches, and unlike in the LWF, this is not contradicted by individual statements from any particular member church body.\n\n[[File:L\u00e6stardianer.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|L\u00e6stadian lay preacher from [[Finnmark]], Norway, 1898|alt=]]\n\n[[Laestadianism|Laestadians]] within certain European state churches maintain close ties to other Laestadians, often called Apostolic Lutherans.

Although [[:s:Augsburg Confession#Article XIV: Of Ecclesiastical Order.|Article XIV]] of the ''Augsburg Confession'' mandates that one must be \"properly called\" to preach or administer the Sacraments, some Lutherans have a broad view of on what constitutes this and thus allow lay preaching or students still studying to be pastors someday to consecrate the Lord's Supper.<ref>For some opinions and historical discussion from someone who takes a broader view, see [https://essays.wls.wels.net/bitstream/handle/123456789/3205/MaaskeCall.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y What is a call?: or, When is a call a call, and who makes it such?] By Alfred H. Maaske</ref> Despite considerable diversity, Lutheran polity trends in a geographically predictable manner in Europe, with episcopal governance to the north and east but blended and consistorial-presbyterian type synodical governance in Germany.\n\n====Scandinavia====\n[[File:\u00c4rkebiskopsvigning.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nathan S\u00f6derblom]] is ordained as archbishop of the Church of Sweden, 1914.

Recently, the Swedish succession was introduced into all of the Porvoo Communion churches, all of which have an episcopal polity. Although the Lutheran churches did not require this or change their doctrine, this was important in order for more strictly high church Anglican individuals to feel comfortable recognizing their sacraments as valid. The occasional ordination of a bishop by a priest was not necessarily considered an invalid ordination in the Middle Ages, so the alleged break in the line of succession in the other Nordic Churches would have been considered a violation of canon law rather than an invalid ordination at the time.  Moreover, there are no consistent records detailing pre-Reformation ordinations prior to the 12th century.<ref>''Das kirchliche Amt in apostolischer Nachfolge''.

However, others are [[S\u00e1mi people#Religion|Orthodox in religion]]. Some Apostolic Lutherans consider their movement as part of an [[Laestadianism#\"Unbroken line of living Christianity\"|unbroken line down from the Apostles]]. In areas where Apostolic Lutherans have their own bishops apart from other Lutheran church organizations, the bishops wield more practical authority than Lutheran clergy typically do. In Russia, Laestadians of Lutheran background cooperate with the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Ingria|Ingrian]] church, but since Laestadianism is an interdenominational movement, some are Eastern Orthodox. Eastern Orthodox Laestadians are known as [[:ru:\u0423\u0448\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0439\u0437\u0435\u0442|Ushkovayzet]] (article is in Russian).<ref>[http://uralistica.com/profiles/blogs/karelskoe-religioznoe Karelian religious movement Uskhovayzet]</ref>\n\n====Eastern Europe and Asian Russia====\n[[File:Spb 06-2012 Nevsky various 06.jpg|thumb|[[Lutheran Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul]] in St. Petersburg]]\nAlthough historically Pietism had a significant influence on the understanding of the ministry among Lutherans in the Russian Empire,{{efn|See [[:ru:\u0412\u044e\u0441\u0442,_\u042d\u0434\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0434|Edward Wust]] and [[:ru:\u0412\u044e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0437\u043c|Wustism]] in the Russian Wikipedia for more on this.}} today nearly all Russian and Ukrainian Lutherans are influenced by Eastern Orthodox polity.

This allows for the post-Soviet repatriation of Lutheran church buildings to local congregations on the basis of this historical connection.<ref>[https://logia.org/pdf-back-issues/15-1pdf-lutheranism-in-asia A New \"Old\" Lutheran Church in Asian Russia] by Alexei Streltsov, in Logia, Epiphany 2006: Volume 15, Number 1</ref>\n\n====Germany====\nIn Germany, several dynamics encouraged Lutherans to maintain a different form of polity. First, due to de facto practice during the [[Nuremberg Religious Peace]] the subsequent legal principal of [[Cuius regio, eius religio]] in the 1555 Peace of Augsburg, German states were officially either Catholic or \"Evangelical\" (that is, Lutheran under the ''Augsburg Confession''). In some areas both Catholic and Lutheran churches were permitted to co-exist. Because German speaking Catholic areas were nearby Catholic leaning Christians were able to emigrate and there was less of an issue with Catholics choosing to live as [[crypto-papist]]s in Lutheran areas. Although Reformed leaning Christians were not allowed to have churches, Melancthon wrote ''[[Augsburg Confession Variata]]'' which some used to claim legal protection as \"Evangelical\" churches. Many chose to live as [[crypto-Calvinists]] either with or without the protection offered by the ''Variata'', but this did not make their influence go away, and as a result the Protestant church in Germany as of 2017 was only about ~40% Lutheran, with most of the rest being United Protestant, a combination of Lutheran and Reformed beliefs and practices.<ref name=EKD18>[https://www.ekd.de/ekd_de/ds_doc/Gezaehlt_zahlen_und_fakten_2019.pdf Zahlen und Fakte zum kirchlichen Leben 2019] Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland</ref>\n\n[[File:KirchenordnungSHA.jpg|thumb|left|[[Schw\u00e4bisch Hall]] Church Order, 1543|alt=]]\nIn terms of polity, over 17th and 18th centuries the carefully negotiated and highly prescriptive [[Church Order (Lutheran)|church orders]] of the Reformation era gave way to a joint cooperation between state control and a Reformed-style blend of consistorial and presbyterian type synodical governance. Just as negotiations over the details in the church orders involved the laity, so did the new synodical governance. Synodical governance had already been practiced in the Reformed Netherlands prior to its adoption by Lutherans. During the formation of the modern German state, ideas about the nature of authority and the best design for governments and organizations came from the philosophies [[Political philosophy of Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Elements of the Philosophy of Right|Hegel]], further modifying the polity. When the monarchy and the sovereign governance of the church was ended in 1918, the synods took over the governance of the state churches.\n\n====Western Hemisphere and Australia====\n[[File:Ministerium Hymnal.jpg|thumb|right|The Pennsylvania Ministerium published this 1803 hymnal.<ref>This website has [https://hymnary.org/hymnal/HELC1865 text and midi files] for the 1865 Pennsylvania Ministerium hymnal.</ref>]]\nDuring the period of the emigration, Lutherans took their existing ideas about polity with them across the ocean,<ref>Abdel Ross Wentz (1954), ''A Basic History of Lutheranism in America'', Philadelphia, Pa., p. 41</ref><ref>Clifton E. Olmstead (1960), ''History of Religion in the United States'', Englewood Cliffs, N.J., pp. 6, 140</ref> though with the exception of the early Swedish Lutherans immigrants of the New Sweden colony who accepted the rule of the Anglican bishops and became part of the established church, they now had to fund churches on their own. This increased the congregationalist dynamic in the blended consistorial and presbyterian type synodical governance. The first organized church body of Lutherans in America was the [[Pennsylvania Ministerium]], which used Reformed style synodical governance over the 18th and 19th centuries. Their contribution to the development of polity was that smaller synods could in turn form a larger body, also with synodical governance, but without losing their lower level of governance. As a result, the smaller synods gained unprecedented flexibility to join, leave, merge, or stay separate, all without the hand of the state as had been the case in Europe.\n\nDuring their 19th century persecution, Old Lutheran believers were left in a bind. Resistance to authority was disobedient, but upholding the true doctrine and right practice was also disobedient. Fortunately the doctrine of the [[lesser magistrate]] could be employed, whereby clergy could legitimately resist the state and even leave. illegal free churches were set up in Germany and mass emigration occurred. For decades the new churches were mostly dependent on the free churches to send them new ministerial candidates for ordination. These new church bodies also employed synodical governance, but tended to exclude Hegelianism in their constitutions due to its incompatibility with the doctrine of the lesser magistrates. In contrast to Hegelianism where authority flows in from all levels, Kantianism presents authority flowing only from the top down, hence the need for a lesser magistrate to become the new top magistrate.\n\n[[File:Lighthouse Lutheran Church in Freedom.jpg|thumb|Lighthouse Lutheran Church, an LCMC congregation in [[Freedom, Pennsylvania]]|alt=]]\nOver the 20th and 20th century, some Lutheran bodies have adopted a more congregationalist approach, such as the [[Protest'ant Conference]] and the [[Lutheran Congregations in Mission for Christ]], or LCMC. The LCMC formed due to a church split after the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America signed an [[Called to Common Mission|agreement]] with the Episcopalians to start ordaining all of their new bishops into the Episcopalian Apostolic succession. In other words, this meant that new ELCA bishops, at least at first, would be jointly ordained by Anglican bishops as well as Lutheran bishops so that the more strict Episcopalians would recognize their sacraments as valid. This was offensive to some in the ELCA at the time because of the implications this had on the [[Theology of Martin Luther#Universal priesthood of the baptized|priesthood of all believers]] and the nature of ordination.\n\nToday, some churches allow dual-rostering.<ref>For example, the single Lutheran church on the island of Guam is a member of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod and the Lutheran Congregations in Mission for Christ. See [http://www.lutheranchurchofguam.org/blog/?page_id=890 Lutheran Church of Guam History]</ref> Situations like this one where a church or church body belongs to multiple larger organizations that do not have ties are termed \"triangular fellowship.\" Another variant are independent Lutheran churches, although for some independent churches the clergy are members of a larger denomination. In other cases, a congregation may belong to a synod, but the pastor may be unaffiliated.<ref>For example, [http://www.trinitynewhaven.com Trinity New Haven, MO] is a member congregation of the Missouri Synod even though their pastor is independent. This congregation was expelled from the Missouri Synod for a while over this, but they challenged it and got back in.</ref> In the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America,<ref>Due to influence from former Missourians joining the ELCA in the [[American Evangelical Lutheran Church]]</ref> the Wisconsin Synod, the Evangelical Lutheran Synod, the Church of the Lutheran Confession, and the Missouri Synod, teachers at parochial schools are considered to be clergy, with the latter defending this before the [[Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & School v.

Soon, Holy Roman Imperial forces joined the battle and conquered the members of the [[Schmalkaldic League]], oppressing and exiling many German Lutherans as they enforced the terms of the [[Augsburg Interim]]. Religious freedom in some areas was secured for Lutherans through the [[Peace of Passau]] in 1552, and under the legal principle of ''[[Cuius regio, eius religio]]'' (the religion of the ruler was to dictate the religion of those ruled) and the [[Declaratio Ferdinandei]] (limited religious tolerance) clauses of the [[Peace of Augsburg]] in 1555.<ref>Fuerbringer, L., ''[https://archive.org/details/concordiacyclope009499mbp Concordia Cyclopedia]'' [[Concordia Publishing House]]. 1927. p. 425</ref>\n[[File:Toleranzbethaus Fresach, copy Hundskirche in der Kreuzen.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|alt=|A Hundskirche replica]]\n\nReligious disputes between the [[Crypto-Calvinism|Crypto-Calvinists]], [[Philippists]], [[Sacramentarians]], [[Ubiquitarians]] and [[Gnesio-Lutherans]] raged within Lutheranism during the middle of the 16th century. This finally ended with the resolution of the issues in the ''[[Formula of Concord]]''. Large numbers of politically and religiously influential leaders met together, debated, and resolved these topics on the basis of Scripture, resulting in the Formula, which over 8,000 leaders signed. The ''[[Book of Concord]]'' replaced earlier, incomplete [[Body of Doctrine|collections of doctrine]], unifying all German Lutherans with identical doctrine and beginning the period of Lutheran Orthodoxy.\n\nIn lands where Catholicism was the state religion, Lutheranism was officially illegal, although enforcement varied. Until the end of the [[Counter-Reformation#Politics|Counter-Reformation]], some Lutherans worshipped secretly, such as at the Hundskirke (which translates as dog church or dog altar). It is a triangle-shaped [[Mass rock|Communion rock]] in a ditch between crosses in [[Paternion]], Austria. The crowned serpent is possibly an allusion to [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor]], while the dog possibly refers to [[Peter Canisius]]. Another figure interpreted as a snail carrying a church tower is possibly a metaphor for the Protestant church. Also on the rock is the number 1599 and a phrase translating as \"thus gets in the world.\"<ref>This photograph is of a replica of the original Hundskirche stone.

[[Lutheran scholasticism]] developed gradually especially for the purpose of arguing with the [[Jesuits]], and it was finally established by [[Johann Gerhard]].

As Lutherans and Orthodox we affirm that the teachings of the ecumenical councils are authoritative for our churches....The Seventh Ecumenical Council, the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, which rejected iconoclasm and restored the veneration of icons in the churches, was not part of the tradition received by the Reformation. Lutherans, however, rejected the iconoclasm of the 16th century, and affirmed the distinction between adoration due to the Triune God alone and all other forms of veneration (CA 21). Through historical research this council has become better known.  Nevertheless it does not have the same significance for Lutherans as it does for the Orthodox. Yet, Lutherans and Orthodox are in agreement that the Second Council of Nicaea confirms the christological teaching of the earlier councils and in setting forth the role of images (icons) in the lives of the faithful reaffirms the reality of the incarnation of the eternal Word of God, when it states: \"The more frequently, Christ, Mary, the mother of God, and the saints are seen, the more are those who see them drawn to remember and long for those who serve as models, and to pay these icons the tribute of salutation and respectful veneration. Certainly this is not the full adoration in accordance with our faith, which is properly paid only to the divine nature, but it resembles that given to the figure of the honored and life-giving cross, and also to the holy books of the gospels and to other sacred objects\" (Definition of the Second Council of Nicaea).}}</ref><ref name=\"Kelly2009\">{{cite book|title=Ecumenical Council|publisher=Titi Tudorancea Encyclopedia|year=1991\u20132016|url=https://www.tititudorancea.net/z/ecumenical_council.htm|quote=The Lutheran World Federation, in ecumenical dialogues with the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople has affirmed all of the first seven councils as ecumenical and authoritative.}}</ref> The ''[[Augsburg Confession]]'' teaches that \"the faith as confessed by Luther and his followers is nothing new, but the true catholic faith, and that their churches represent the true catholic or universal church\".<ref name=\"Ludwig2016\">{{cite magazine|title=Luther's Catholic Reformation|last=Ludwig|first=Alan|date=12 September 2016|magazine=The Lutheran Witness|language=English|quote=When the Lutherans presented the ''Augsburg Confession'' before Emperor Charles V in 1530, they carefully showed that each article of faith and practice was true first of all to Holy Scripture, and then also to the teaching of the church fathers and the councils and even the canon law of the Church of Rome.

Martin Luther was a great fan of music, and this is why it forms a large part of Lutheran services; in particular, Luther admired the composers [[Josquin des Prez]] and [[Ludwig Senfl]] and wanted singing in the church to move away from the ''ars perfecta'' (Catholic Sacred Music of the late Renaissance) and towards singing as a ''[[Gemeinschaft]]'' (community).<ref>Taruskin, Richard.

Lutheran hymnody is well known for its doctrinal, [[didactic]], and musical richness. Most Lutheran churches are active musically with choirs, handbell choirs, children's choirs, and occasionally [[change ringing]] groups that ring bells in a [[bell tower]]. [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], a devout Lutheran, composed music for the Lutheran church.\n\n[[File:Cropped Luckau Nikolaikirche Abendmahlsbild.jpg|thumb|left|[[Divine Service (Lutheran)|Divine Service]] at the St. Nicholas church in [[Luckau#History|Luckau]], Germany|alt=]]\nLutherans also preserve a liturgical approach to the celebration of the Mass (or the Holy Eucharist/Communion), emphasizing the sacrament as the central act of Christian worship. Lutherans believe that the actual body and blood of Jesus Christ are present in, with and under the bread and the wine. This belief is called [[Real Presence]] or [[sacramental union]] and is different from [[consubstantiation]] and [[transubstantiation]]. Additionally Lutherans reject the idea that communion is a mere symbol or [[Memorialism|memorial]]. They confess in the ''[[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]]'':\n<blockquote>[W]e do not abolish the Mass but religiously keep and defend it. Among us the Mass is celebrated every Lord's Day and on other [[s:Augsburg Confession#Article XV: Of Ecclesiastical Usages.|festivals]], when the Sacrament is made available to those who wish to partake of it, after they have been examined and absolved. We also keep traditional liturgical forms, such as the order of readings, prayers, vestments, and other similar things.<ref>''Apology of the Augsburg Confession'', Article XXIV.1</ref></blockquote>Besides the Holy Communion (Divine Service), congregations also hold offices, which are worship services without communion. They may include [[Matins in Lutheranism|Matins]], [[Vespers in Lutheranism|Vespers]], [[Compline]], and [[Easter Vigil#Lutheran churches|Easter Vigil]]. Private or family offices include the [[s:Luther's Small Catechism#HOW THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY Should Teach His Household to Bless Themselves in the Morning and in the Evening.|Morning and Evening Prayers]] from Luther's ''Small Catechism''.<ref name=daily>See [http://www.bookofconcord.com/smallcatechism.php#prayers Luther's Small Catechism, Daily Prayers]</ref> Meals are blessed with the ''[[Common table prayer]]'', {{bibleverse||Psalm|145:15\u201316|31}}, or other prayers, and after eating the Lord is thanked, for example, with {{bibleverse||Psalm|136:1|9}}.

These services were in a variety of styles, depending on the preferences of the congregation. Often they were held alongside a traditional service in order to cater to those who preferred [[contemporary worship music]]. Today, few but some Lutheran congregations have contemporary worship as their sole form of worship. Outreach is no longer given as the primary motivation; rather this form of worship is seen as more in keeping with the desires of individual congregations.<ref>Principle examples of this in the ELCA include [http://www.familyofgod.us Family of God, Cape Coral FL.], [http://www.the-well.org/ The Well, Charlotte NC], [http://www.hosannalc.org Hosanna! of Lakeville, Minnesota], and [http://www.apostleschurch.org/home.php Church of the Apostles, Seattle WA.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820204437/http://www.apostleschurch.org/home.php |date=20 August 2006 }}.</ref> In Finland, Lutherans have experimented with the {{illm|St Thomas Mass|fi|Tuomasmessu}} and [[Metal Mass]] in which traditional hymns are adapted to heavy metal. Some Laestadians enter a heavily emotional and [[religious ecstasy|ecstatic]] state during worship. The [[Lutheran World Federation]], in its Nairobi Statement on Worship and Culture, recommended every effort be made to bring church services into a more sensitive position with regard to cultural context.<ref>\"A given culture's values and patterns, insofar as they are consonant with the values of the Gospel, can be used to express the meaning and purpose of Christian worship.

Along with these, the most widely used among English speaking congregations include: ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Hymnary]]'' (1996, [[Evangelical Lutheran Synod]]), ''The [[Lutheran Book of Worship]]'' (1978, [[Lutheran Council in the United States of America]]), ''[[Lutheran Worship]]'' (1982, LCMS), ''[[Christian Worship Hymnal|Christian Worship]]'' (1993, [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]]), and ''[[The Lutheran Hymnal]]'' (1941, [[Evangelical Lutheran Synodical Conference of North America]]). In the [[Lutheran Church of Australia]], the official hymnal is the ''Lutheran Hymnal with Supplement'' of 1986, which includes a supplement to the ''Lutheran Hymnal'' of 1973, itself a replacement for the ''Australian Lutheran Hymn Book'' of 1921. Prior to this time, the two Lutheran church bodies in Australia ([[History of the Lutheran Church of Australia#Merge of UELCA and ELCA into the Lutheran Church of Australia|which merged in 1966]]) used a bewildering variety of hymnals, usually in the German language. Spanish-speaking ELCA churches frequently use ''Libro de Liturgia y C\u00e1ntico'' (1998, Augsburg Fortress) for services and hymns.

[[Philipp Melanchthon]] and his [[Philippists|Philippist]] party felt that Christians of different beliefs should join in union with each other without completely agreeing on doctrine. Against them stood the [[Gnesio-Lutherans]], led by [[Matthias Flacius]] and the faculty at the [[University of Jena]]. They condemned the Philippist position for [[indifferentism]], describing it as a \"unionistic compromise\" of precious Reformation theology. Instead, they held that genuine unity between Christians and real theological peace was only possible with an honest agreement about every subject of doctrinal controversy.<ref>Klug, Eugene F. and Stahlke, Otto F.

''Getting into the Formula of Concord''. St. Louis: Concordia. p. 18</ref> Although they decried the visible division of Christians on earth, [[Lutheran Orthodoxy|orthodox Lutherans]] avoided [[ecumenism|ecumenical]] fellowship with other churches, believing that Christians should not, for example, join together for the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]] or exchange pastors if they do not completely agree about what the Bible teaches.

Some Lutherans assert that everyone must share the \"whole counsel of God\" (Acts 20:27) in complete unity (1 Cor. 1:10)<ref>For a historical example, see Robert Preus, ''To Join or Not To Join''. [[North Dakota District (LCMS)|North Dakota District of The Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]], 1968.</ref> before pastors can share each other's pulpits, and before communicants commune at each other's altars, a practice termed [[closed communion|closed (or close) communion]]. On the other hand, other Lutherans practice varying degrees of [[open communion]] and allow preachers from other Christian denominations in their pulpits.\n\nWhile not an issue in the majority of Lutheran church bodies, some of them forbid membership in [[Freemasonry]]. Partly, this is because the lodge is viewed as spreading [[Unitarianism]], as the Brief Statement of the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod|LCMS]] reads, \"Hence we warn against Unitarianism, which in our country has to a great extent impenetrated the sects and is being spread particularly also through the influence of the lodges.\"<ref>See [http://www.lcms.org/pages/internal.asp?NavID=564 Brief Statement was adopted as LCMS doctrine in 1932, and from time to time has been adopted by other Lutherans] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514030409/http://www.lcms.org/pages/internal.asp?NavID=564 |date=14 May 2008 }}</ref> A 1958 report from the publishing house of the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] states that, \"Masonry is guilty of idolatry.

These organizations together account for the great majority of Lutheran denominations. The [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod|LCMS]] and the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Canada]] are members of the ILC. The [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod|WELS]] and [[Evangelical Lutheran Synod|ELS]] are members of the CELC. Many Lutheran churches are not affiliated with the LWF, the ILC or the CELC: The congregations of the [[Church of the Lutheran Confession]] (CLC) are affiliated with their mission organizations in Canada, India, Nepal, Myanmar, and many African nations; and those affiliated with the [[Church of the Lutheran Brethren]] are especially active doing mission work in Africa and East Asia.\n\nThe Lutheran World Federation-aligned churches do not believe that one church is singularly true in its teachings. According to this belief, Lutheranism is a reform movement rather than a movement into doctrinal correctness. As part of this, in 1999 the LWF and the Roman Catholic Church jointly issued a statement, the ''[[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]]'', that stated that the LWF and the Catholics both agreed about certain basics of Justification and lifted certain Catholic [[anathema]]s formerly applying to the LWF member churches.{{Citation needed span|The LCMS has participated in most of the [[Lutheran-Roman Catholic dialogue|official dialogues with the Roman Catholic Church]] since shortly after the [[Second Vatican Council]], though not the one which produced the ''Joint Declaration'' and to which they were not invited.

As of 2019, the Forum is not a full communion organization. Similar in this structure is the [[International Lutheran Council]], where issues of communion are left to the individual denominations. Not all ILC churches have declared church-fellowship with each other. In contrast, mutual church-fellowship is part of the CELC member churches, and unlike in the LWF, this is not contradicted by individual statements from any particular member church body.\n\n[[File:L\u00e6stardianer.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|L\u00e6stadian lay preacher from [[Finnmark]], Norway, 1898|alt=]]\n\n[[Laestadianism|Laestadians]] within certain European state churches maintain close ties to other Laestadians, often called Apostolic Lutherans.

Nearly all are located in Europe, although they there are 15 combined in North America, [[Ecuador]], [[Togo]], and Kenya.\n\nBy contrast, the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference and International Lutheran Council as well as some unaffiliated denominations such as the Church of the Lutheran Confession and North American Laestadians maintain that the orthodox confessional Lutheran churches are the only churches with completely correct doctrine. They teach that while other Christian churches teach partially orthodox doctrine and have true Christians as members, the doctrines of those churches contain significant errors. More conservative Lutherans strive to maintain historical distinctiveness while emphasizing doctrinal purity alongside Gospel-motivated outreach.

Recently, the Swedish succession was introduced into all of the Porvoo Communion churches, all of which have an episcopal polity. Although the Lutheran churches did not require this or change their doctrine, this was important in order for more strictly high church Anglican individuals to feel comfortable recognizing their sacraments as valid. The occasional ordination of a bishop by a priest was not necessarily considered an invalid ordination in the Middle Ages, so the alleged break in the line of succession in the other Nordic Churches would have been considered a violation of canon law rather than an invalid ordination at the time.  Moreover, there are no consistent records detailing pre-Reformation ordinations prior to the 12th century.<ref>''Das kirchliche Amt in apostolischer Nachfolge''.

Some Apostolic Lutherans consider their movement as part of an [[Laestadianism#\"Unbroken line of living Christianity\"|unbroken line down from the Apostles]].

In Russia, Laestadians of Lutheran background cooperate with the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Ingria|Ingrian]] church, but since Laestadianism is an interdenominational movement, some are Eastern Orthodox.

First, due to de facto practice during the [[Nuremberg Religious Peace]] the subsequent legal principal of [[Cuius regio, eius religio]] in the 1555 Peace of Augsburg, German states were officially either Catholic or \"Evangelical\" (that is, Lutheran under the ''Augsburg Confession''). In some areas both Catholic and Lutheran churches were permitted to co-exist. Because German speaking Catholic areas were nearby Catholic leaning Christians were able to emigrate and there was less of an issue with Catholics choosing to live as [[crypto-papist]]s in Lutheran areas. Although Reformed leaning Christians were not allowed to have churches, Melancthon wrote ''[[Augsburg Confession Variata]]'' which some used to claim legal protection as \"Evangelical\" churches. Many chose to live as [[crypto-Calvinists]] either with or without the protection offered by the ''Variata'', but this did not make their influence go away, and as a result the Protestant church in Germany as of 2017 was only about ~40% Lutheran, with most of the rest being United Protestant, a combination of Lutheran and Reformed beliefs and practices.<ref name=EKD18>[https://www.ekd.de/ekd_de/ds_doc/Gezaehlt_zahlen_und_fakten_2019.pdf Zahlen und Fakte zum kirchlichen Leben 2019] Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland</ref>\n\n[[File:KirchenordnungSHA.jpg|thumb|left|[[Schw\u00e4bisch Hall]] Church Order, 1543|alt=]]\nIn terms of polity, over 17th and 18th centuries the carefully negotiated and highly prescriptive [[Church Order (Lutheran)|church orders]] of the Reformation era gave way to a joint cooperation between state control and a Reformed-style blend of consistorial and presbyterian type synodical governance. Just as negotiations over the details in the church orders involved the laity, so did the new synodical governance. Synodical governance had already been practiced in the Reformed Netherlands prior to its adoption by Lutherans. During the formation of the modern German state, ideas about the nature of authority and the best design for governments and organizations came from the philosophies [[Political philosophy of Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Elements of the Philosophy of Right|Hegel]], further modifying the polity. When the monarchy and the sovereign governance of the church was ended in 1918, the synods took over the governance of the state churches.\n\n====Western Hemisphere and Australia====\n[[File:Ministerium Hymnal.jpg|thumb|right|The Pennsylvania Ministerium published this 1803 hymnal.<ref>This website has [https://hymnary.org/hymnal/HELC1865 text and midi files] for the 1865 Pennsylvania Ministerium hymnal.</ref>]]\nDuring the period of the emigration, Lutherans took their existing ideas about polity with them across the ocean,<ref>Abdel Ross Wentz (1954), ''A Basic History of Lutheranism in America'', Philadelphia, Pa., p. 41</ref><ref>Clifton E. Olmstead (1960), ''History of Religion in the United States'', Englewood Cliffs, N.J., pp. 6, 140</ref> though with the exception of the early Swedish Lutherans immigrants of the New Sweden colony who accepted the rule of the Anglican bishops and became part of the established church, they now had to fund churches on their own. This increased the congregationalist dynamic in the blended consistorial and presbyterian type synodical governance. The first organized church body of Lutherans in America was the [[Pennsylvania Ministerium]], which used Reformed style synodical governance over the 18th and 19th centuries. Their contribution to the development of polity was that smaller synods could in turn form a larger body, also with synodical governance, but without losing their lower level of governance. As a result, the smaller synods gained unprecedented flexibility to join, leave, merge, or stay separate, all without the hand of the state as had been the case in Europe.\n\nDuring their 19th century persecution, Old Lutheran believers were left in a bind. Resistance to authority was disobedient, but upholding the true doctrine and right practice was also disobedient. Fortunately the doctrine of the [[lesser magistrate]] could be employed, whereby clergy could legitimately resist the state and even leave. illegal free churches were set up in Germany and mass emigration occurred. For decades the new churches were mostly dependent on the free churches to send them new ministerial candidates for ordination. These new church bodies also employed synodical governance, but tended to exclude Hegelianism in their constitutions due to its incompatibility with the doctrine of the lesser magistrates. In contrast to Hegelianism where authority flows in from all levels, Kantianism presents authority flowing only from the top down, hence the need for a lesser magistrate to become the new top magistrate.\n\n[[File:Lighthouse Lutheran Church in Freedom.jpg|thumb|Lighthouse Lutheran Church, an LCMC congregation in [[Freedom, Pennsylvania]]|alt=]]\nOver the 20th and 20th century, some Lutheran bodies have adopted a more congregationalist approach, such as the [[Protest'ant Conference]] and the [[Lutheran Congregations in Mission for Christ]], or LCMC. The LCMC formed due to a church split after the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America signed an [[Called to Common Mission|agreement]] with the Episcopalians to start ordaining all of their new bishops into the Episcopalian Apostolic succession. In other words, this meant that new ELCA bishops, at least at first, would be jointly ordained by Anglican bishops as well as Lutheran bishops so that the more strict Episcopalians would recognize their sacraments as valid. This was offensive to some in the ELCA at the time because of the implications this had on the [[Theology of Martin Luther#Universal priesthood of the baptized|priesthood of all believers]] and the nature of ordination.\n\nToday, some churches allow dual-rostering.<ref>For example, the single Lutheran church on the island of Guam is a member of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod and the Lutheran Congregations in Mission for Christ. See [http://www.lutheranchurchofguam.org/blog/?page_id=890 Lutheran Church of Guam History]</ref> Situations like this one where a church or church body belongs to multiple larger organizations that do not have ties are termed \"triangular fellowship.\" Another variant are independent Lutheran churches, although for some independent churches the clergy are members of a larger denomination.

His father, Joannes (Ivan) Slipy, was born 19 May, 1846<ref>[Metrical record for birth of Joannes Sliepy (sic), 19 May 1846, Vol 487-1/256. Film# 2152026/9],[LDS FHC], digital images [Familysearch.org] ([http://familysearch.org]: accessed [January 11, 2019])</ref> in Zazdrist (Pol: Zazdrosc) into a family of local Ukrainian farmers. His mother was Anastasia Dychkovska (born in 1850), the daughter of Roman Dychkovski, also from Zazdrist. Both clans were well rooted in the village and can be traced there as far back as existing records allow.  Interestingly, but not uncommon, one of Cardinal Josyf's great grandfathers, Adalberti Slominski, was of the Roman Catholic (Latin) rite. Unlike most Ukrainian Catholic priests at the time, Josyf Slipy did not come from a sacerdotal family, which was considered an elite, educated caste among Ukrainians, but had common roots instead.  As a teen Josyf studied at the gymnasium in Ternopil and then at the Lviv Greek-Catholic Seminary and [[Innsbruck University]] in Austria, before being [[ordained]] a priest on 30 June 1917. From 1920 to 1922, he studied in Rome at the [[Pontifical Oriental Institute]], the ''Collegio Angelico'' ([[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']]),<ref>http://archive.khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1113997592  Accessed 21, 7, 2013</ref>  and the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]]. He returned to Lw\u00f3w (''[[Lviv]]''), by then part of [[Poland|Second Polish Republic]].\n\nAfter a short pastoral assignment, in 1922 Slipyi became a professor of dogmatic theology at the Lviv Holy Spirit Seminary. In 1926 he became the rector of the seminary and actively participated in its development.  In 1923 he established the Theological Academic Society, for which he wrote the articles of association and enrolled scholars. In the same year, he became an editor of the quarterly ''Bohosloviia'' (Theology). On April 14, 1929, Slipyi became the first rector of the Lviv Theological Academy (the predecessor to the Ukrainian Catholic University).\n\nIn 1926, Slipyj became a member of the supervisory board of the Lviv National Museum, and in 1931  Deputy Chairman of the Ukrainian Catholic Union. Due to his scholarly merits and active development of Ukrainian cultural and religious life, Slipyi became a member of the Shevchenko Scientific Society. At this time he made numerous research trips to Western Europe, Holy Land, took part in union congresses in Velegrad, Prague, Pinsk and 1936 he organized a union congress in Lviv.\n\n=== Soviet and Fascist Occupation ===\nOn 22 December 1939, with the blessing of [[Pope Pius XII]], Slipyj was ordained [[archbishop]] of [[Titular see|Serrae]] and Coadjutor Archbishop of Lviv with the right of succession. The ordination was conducted by [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] [[Andrey Sheptytsky]] in secrecy due to the [[Soviet annexation of Western Ukraine, 1939\u20131940|Soviet presence]] and the political situation.\n\nOn 30 June 1941, Josyf Slipyj supported the Act of Declaration of Ukrainian State. Slipyj became the head of the  Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church on 1 November 1944, following Sheptytsky's death.\n\nAfter Soviet troops captured Lviv, Slipyj was arrested along with other bishops in 1945 by the [[NKVD]], convicted to penal servitude, allegedly for [[collaboration]] with the Nazi regime. This was the first step in the planned liquidation of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church by Soviet authorities.<ref>Bociurkiw, B.R., ''The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and the Soviet State (1939\u20131950).''

The [[Union of Brest]], the council at which the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church formally entered into ecclesiastic communion with the Holy See, was revoked. The Church was forcibly \"rejoined\" to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].\n\nSlipyj rejected any offers of conversion into Orthodoxy and was continuously sentenced in 1953, 1957, 1962, thus totally imprisoned for 18 years in camps in Siberia and Mordovia ([[Dubravlag]] in [[Potma, Zubovo-Polyansky District, Republic of Mordovia|Potma]]). Slipyj spent five years in Maklakovo (Krasnoyarsk region), where he wrote a multi-volume history of the Universal Church in Ukraine.<ref>To the Light of Resurrection through the Thorns of Catacombs: The Underground Activity and Reemergence of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. Lviv, Ukrainian Catholic University Press, 2014, p.80.</ref>\n\nAccording to Mykola Posivnych, Josyf Slipyj saw his imprisonment years as lost years. He was devastated since the best years of his life in terms of productivity, Slipyj had to spend among criminals, investigators, and jailers. Numerous times he went through illnesses as well as having his legs and hands broken and frostbitten.\n\nSlipyj's prison writings managed to circulate. In 1957 [[Pope Pius XII]] sent him a congratulatory letter on the 40th anniversary of his ordination to the priesthood. It was confiscated, and also on account of his circulating writings, he was sentenced to seven more years in prison.\n\n=== Release to Rome and honors from the Vatican ===\nOn 23 January 1963, he was freed by [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s administration after political pressure from [[Pope John XXIII]] and United States President [[John F. Kennedy]]. He arrived in Rome on 9 February 1963 in time to participate in the [[Second Vatican Council]].\n\nBeginning in 1963 many [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] bishops lobbied for Slipyj to be named [[patriarch]], but [[Pope Paul VI]] refused, instead creating the new office of [[major archbishop]] and appointing Slipyj as its first incumbent on 23 December 1963.<ref>{{Catholic-hierarchy|bishop|bslipiy|Josyf Ivanovyc\u00e8 Cardinal Slipyj (Slipiy)|21 January 2015}}</ref> \n{{Infobox cardinal styles\n| cardinal name = Josyf Slipyj\n| dipstyle      = His Eminence\n| offstyle      = Your Eminence\n| see           = Kiev and Halych\n| image         = Coat of arms of Josyf Slipyj.svg\n| image_size    = 200px\n}}\nOn 25 January 1965 Pope Paul VI named Slipyj  a cardinal and appointed him Cardinal-Priest of [[Sant'Atanasio]].<ref>[http://www.gcatholic.org/churches/cardinal/119.htm Cardinal Title S. Atanasio] GCatholic.org</ref> At the time he was the 4th cardinal in Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church history. In 1949 he had been secretly (''[[in pectore]]'') named a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] by [[Pope Pius XII]],{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} but this would have expired in 1958 when that pope died.\n\nBecause, as already noted above, he was major archbishop (not patriarch), he was cardinal priest instead of being in the then-new rank of cardinal patriarch.  His successors in Ukraine, whether cardinals or not, have used the title of major archbishop.\n\nHe did not participate in the 1978 papal conclaves in [[Papal conclave, August 1978|August]] and [[Papal conclave, October 1978|October]] being past the age of 80 then.\n\nOn the first occasion of an audience with Pope John Paul II, the Pope showed respect by greeting Cardinal Slipyj first, which was contrary to protocol.\n\n=== Reorganization of UGCC life ===\nFrom the start of his arrival in Rome the Major Archbishop strove to organize the self-management of the local Ukrainian Catholic Church, headed by the patriarch. This idea was not supported by the Apostolic See.\n\nIn 1968, 1970, 1973 and 1976 Cardinal Slipyj visited countries in Europe, America, Asia and Australia in order to strengthen the ties with the Ukrainian diaspora overseas, and to reinvigorate the religious life of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church abroad. During these years he also took part in three international Eucharistic Congresses (Bombay, Bogota, Melbourne).\n\nIn 1977, Slipyj consecrated [[Ivan Choma]], [[Stefan Czmil]] and [[Lubomyr Husar]] as bishops without approval of the pope in an act of exposition of patriarchal aspirations. These consecrations caused much annoyance to the Roman Curia as episcopal consecrations without papal permission are considered illicit in Roman Canon Law but not Eastern Canon Law.<ref>[http://www.apostolische-nachfolge.de/Ukraine%20(English).htm Apostolische Nachfolge: Ukraine.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914213026/http://www.apostolische-nachfolge.de/Ukraine%20(English).htm |date=14 September 2017 }} German site of CSSp Province</ref>\n\nAs a Major Archbishop with Patriarchal rights, Slipyj gathered a number of synods of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. The most significant ones took place in 1969, 1971 and 1973. During the last Synod, the constitution of the UGCC patriarchal arrangement was adopted. Slipyj published his ordinances in \u201cEvangelicum of the Major Archbishop of the Byzantine-Ukrainian rite\u201d starting from 1964.\n\nIn Rome, he bought and rebuilt church of Saint Sergius and Bacchus for Ukrainian Catholics. On the territory of church both museum and hospice were founded.   In 1967-1968, the cathedral of Santa Sofia on Via Boccea was built in Rome at his orders.\n\nIn 1960 he revitalized the Ukrainian Theological Scientific Society in exile and restored the publishing of \u201cBohoslovia\u201d (Theology) in 1963 and the journal \u201cDzvony\u201d (Bells) in 1976.\n\nIn 1963 Slipyj organized the Ukrainian Catholic University of St. Clement with an academic publishing house.\n\n=== Death and burial ===\nAlthough Slipyj was banned from entering Ukraine by the leaders of the USSR, including Nikita Khrushchev, nevertheless he refused to give up his Soviet passport.\n\nHe died in Rome on 7 September 1984.<ref name=\"NYT Obit\">{{cite web |title=Josyf Cardinal Slipyj is Dead; Soviet Prisoner for 18 Years |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/08/obituaries/josyf-cardinal-slipyj-is-dead-soviet-prisioner-for-18-years.html |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=4 March 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The World Almanac and Book of Facts 1985 |date=1984 |publisher=Newspaper Enterprise Association, Inc. |location=New York |isbn=0-911818-71-5 |page=34}}</ref> After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], his [[relic]]s were [[Translation (relic)|returned]] to St. George's Cathedral in Lviv, and were reburied there August 27\u201329, 1992.\n\nHis cause for [[canonisation]] has been introduced at Rome.\n\n== Intellectual interests ==\nIn his research work he concentrated on approximating the scholasticism of Saint Thomas Aquinas to the requirements of Eastern Theology. Slipyj wrote a number of dogmatic works on the importance of the Holy Trinity, the origin of the Holy Spirit and Holy Sacraments, among which are:\n\n\u00b7      ''\u00abDie Trinitatslehre des byzantinischen Patriarchen Photios\u00bb'', 1921\n\n\u00b7      ''\u00abDe principo spirationis in SS.

Opened in September 1985.\n\n'''Streets'''\n\nA number of Ukrainian cities\u2019 streets hold the name of Patriarch Josyf Slipyj (Lviv, Ternopil, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kolomyia).\n\n'''Commemorative events'''\n\nThe year 2002 was dedicated by the UGCC to the commemoration of the 110th anniversary of Josyf Slipyj birth. On this occasion in July a pilgrimage to Zarvanytsia took place, with pilgrims coming from various parts of Ukraine, Canada, the US, altogether more than 200.000.\n\nOn 22 March 2012, the Ukrainian parliament issued an order to commemorate the 120th anniversary of Josyf Slipyj\u2019s birth. The parliament suggested that the government establish an organizational committee that would develop a program of events to honor the anniversary on the state-wide level. The parliament also proposed to republish Josyf Slipyj\u2019s works, organize a conference in Kyiv on the topic \u201cPatriarch Josyf Slipyj\u2019s role in Ukrainian state creation and the formation of national identity of Ukrainian people\u201d, and initiate measures to preserve and restore objects related to Slipyj activities. The National Bank of Ukraine was ordered to issue a commemorative coin from the series \u201cProminent Ukrainians\u201d with Slipyj\u2019s depiction. The Ukrainian Postal Service \u201cUkrposhta\u201d was ordered to print envelops and postage stamps with Slipyj\u2019s portrait.\n\nTo commemorate the 125th anniversary of birth of Major Archbishop of Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and long-sentenced political prisoner of Soviet concentration camps, Lviv regional council dedicated the year 2017 to Josyf Slipyj.\n\n==''The Shoes of the Fisherman''==\nIt seems likely that Slipyj's life story was known to the Australian writer [[Morris West]]'s 1963 novel ''[[The Shoes of the Fisherman]]''. West's protagonist is Kiril Pavlovich Lakota, the Metropolitan Archbishop of Lviv, who is freed by the [[Soviet Premier]] after 17 years in a Siberian labor camp. He is sent to Rome, where an elderly pope makes him a cardinal. The Pontiff dies, and Lakota finds himself elected Pope, taking the name Kiril I (a rare modern use of a baptismal name as a [[papal name]]).\n\nDespite the similarities, it is not clear to what extent West used Slipyj or Bishop [[Hryhorij Lakota]] (who died in 1950 in the gulag) as a particular model for his character. The book begins with a disclaimer:  \u201cThis is a book set in a fictional time, peopled with fictional characters, and no reference is intended to any living person, whether in the Church or out of it.\u201d According to the publisher, ''The Shoes of the Fisherman'' was written between March 1961 and August 1962,<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Between Moscow and Rome: Struggle for the Greek Catholic Patriarchate in Ukraine|last = Plokhy|first = Serhii|date = 1995|journal = Journal of Church and State|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> which is before Slipyj's release.\n\nThe novelty of a Ukrainian pope in a post-[[Cuban Missile Crisis]], [[Cold War]] world led to the book being featured on ''[[The New York Times Best Seller list]]''. It was the number 1 [[bestseller]] of the entire year on the ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' fiction list, and the parallels led to increased fame for Slipyj.\n\n[[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]'s film version appeared in 1968, starring [[Anthony Quinn]] as Lakota/Kiril I and [[Laurence Olivier]] as the (fictional) USSR Premier Piotr Ilyich Kamenev (and Lakota's jailer). It was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]].\n\nSome today regard ''The Shoes of the Fisherman'' as prophetic because it preceded by 15 years the election of Karol J\u00f3zef Wojty\u0142a as [[Pope John Paul II]], the first [[Slavs|Slavic]] pope as well as one from a [[Communist state|Communist nation]], noting even the Kiril/Karol similarity of names.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Sant'Atanasio]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book | author=[[Jaroslav Pelikan|Pelikan, Jaroslav]] | title=Confessor Between East and West | location=Grand Rapids | publisher=William B.

His father, Joannes (Ivan) Slipy, was born 19 May, 1846<ref>[Metrical record for birth of Joannes Sliepy (sic), 19 May 1846, Vol 487-1/256. Film# 2152026/9],[LDS FHC], digital images [Familysearch.org] ([http://familysearch.org]: accessed [January 11, 2019])</ref> in Zazdrist (Pol: Zazdrosc) into a family of local Ukrainian farmers. His mother was Anastasia Dychkovska (born in 1850), the daughter of Roman Dychkovski, also from Zazdrist. Both clans were well rooted in the village and can be traced there as far back as existing records allow.  Interestingly, but not uncommon, one of Cardinal Josyf's great grandfathers, Adalberti Slominski, was of the Roman Catholic (Latin) rite. Unlike most Ukrainian Catholic priests at the time, Josyf Slipy did not come from a sacerdotal family, which was considered an elite, educated caste among Ukrainians, but had common roots instead.  As a teen Josyf studied at the gymnasium in Ternopil and then at the Lviv Greek-Catholic Seminary and [[Innsbruck University]] in Austria, before being [[ordained]] a priest on 30 June 1917. From 1920 to 1922, he studied in Rome at the [[Pontifical Oriental Institute]], the ''Collegio Angelico'' ([[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']]),<ref>http://archive.khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1113997592  Accessed 21, 7, 2013</ref>  and the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]]. He returned to Lw\u00f3w (''[[Lviv]]''), by then part of [[Poland|Second Polish Republic]].\n\nAfter a short pastoral assignment, in 1922 Slipyi became a professor of dogmatic theology at the Lviv Holy Spirit Seminary. In 1926 he became the rector of the seminary and actively participated in its development.  In 1923 he established the Theological Academic Society, for which he wrote the articles of association and enrolled scholars. In the same year, he became an editor of the quarterly ''Bohosloviia'' (Theology). On April 14, 1929, Slipyi became the first rector of the Lviv Theological Academy (the predecessor to the Ukrainian Catholic University).\n\nIn 1926, Slipyj became a member of the supervisory board of the Lviv National Museum, and in 1931  Deputy Chairman of the Ukrainian Catholic Union. Due to his scholarly merits and active development of Ukrainian cultural and religious life, Slipyi became a member of the Shevchenko Scientific Society. At this time he made numerous research trips to Western Europe, Holy Land, took part in union congresses in Velegrad, Prague, Pinsk and 1936 he organized a union congress in Lviv.\n\n=== Soviet and Fascist Occupation ===\nOn 22 December 1939, with the blessing of [[Pope Pius XII]], Slipyj was ordained [[archbishop]] of [[Titular see|Serrae]] and Coadjutor Archbishop of Lviv with the right of succession. The ordination was conducted by [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] [[Andrey Sheptytsky]] in secrecy due to the [[Soviet annexation of Western Ukraine, 1939\u20131940|Soviet presence]] and the political situation.\n\nOn 30 June 1941, Josyf Slipyj supported the Act of Declaration of Ukrainian State. Slipyj became the head of the  Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church on 1 November 1944, following Sheptytsky's death.\n\nAfter Soviet troops captured Lviv, Slipyj was arrested along with other bishops in 1945 by the [[NKVD]], convicted to penal servitude, allegedly for [[collaboration]] with the Nazi regime. This was the first step in the planned liquidation of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church by Soviet authorities.<ref>Bociurkiw, B.R., ''The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and the Soviet State (1939\u20131950).''

The [[Union of Brest]], the council at which the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church formally entered into ecclesiastic communion with the Holy See, was revoked. The Church was forcibly \"rejoined\" to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].\n\nSlipyj rejected any offers of conversion into Orthodoxy and was continuously sentenced in 1953, 1957, 1962, thus totally imprisoned for 18 years in camps in Siberia and Mordovia ([[Dubravlag]] in [[Potma, Zubovo-Polyansky District, Republic of Mordovia|Potma]]). Slipyj spent five years in Maklakovo (Krasnoyarsk region), where he wrote a multi-volume history of the Universal Church in Ukraine.<ref>To the Light of Resurrection through the Thorns of Catacombs: The Underground Activity and Reemergence of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. Lviv, Ukrainian Catholic University Press, 2014, p.80.</ref>\n\nAccording to Mykola Posivnych, Josyf Slipyj saw his imprisonment years as lost years. He was devastated since the best years of his life in terms of productivity, Slipyj had to spend among criminals, investigators, and jailers. Numerous times he went through illnesses as well as having his legs and hands broken and frostbitten.\n\nSlipyj's prison writings managed to circulate. In 1957 [[Pope Pius XII]] sent him a congratulatory letter on the 40th anniversary of his ordination to the priesthood. It was confiscated, and also on account of his circulating writings, he was sentenced to seven more years in prison.\n\n=== Release to Rome and honors from the Vatican ===\nOn 23 January 1963, he was freed by [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s administration after political pressure from [[Pope John XXIII]] and United States President [[John F. Kennedy]]. He arrived in Rome on 9 February 1963 in time to participate in the [[Second Vatican Council]].\n\nBeginning in 1963 many [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] bishops lobbied for Slipyj to be named [[patriarch]], but [[Pope Paul VI]] refused, instead creating the new office of [[major archbishop]] and appointing Slipyj as its first incumbent on 23 December 1963.<ref>{{Catholic-hierarchy|bishop|bslipiy|Josyf Ivanovyc\u00e8 Cardinal Slipyj (Slipiy)|21 January 2015}}</ref> \n{{Infobox cardinal styles\n| cardinal name = Josyf Slipyj\n| dipstyle      = His Eminence\n| offstyle      = Your Eminence\n| see           = Kiev and Halych\n| image         = Coat of arms of Josyf Slipyj.svg\n| image_size    = 200px\n}}\nOn 25 January 1965 Pope Paul VI named Slipyj  a cardinal and appointed him Cardinal-Priest of [[Sant'Atanasio]].<ref>[http://www.gcatholic.org/churches/cardinal/119.htm Cardinal Title S.

In 1949 he had been secretly (''[[in pectore]]'') named a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] by [[Pope Pius XII]],{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} but this would have expired in 1958 when that pope died.\n\nBecause, as already noted above, he was major archbishop (not patriarch), he was cardinal priest instead of being in the then-new rank of cardinal patriarch.  His successors in the Ukraine, whether cardinals or not, have used the title of major archbishop.\n\nHe did not participate in the 1978 papal conclaves in [[Papal conclave, August 1978|August]] and [[Papal conclave, October 1978|October]] being past the age of 80 then.\n\nOn the first occasion of an audience with Pope John Paul II, the Pope showed respect by greeting Cardinal Slipyj first, which was contrary to protocol.\n\n=== Reorganization of UGCC life ===\nFrom the start of his arrival in Rome the Major Archbishop strove to organize the self-management of the local Ukrainian Catholic Church, headed by the patriarch. This idea was not supported by the Apostolic See.\n\nIn 1968, 1970, 1973 and 1976 Cardinal Slipyj visited countries in Europe, America, Asia and Australia in order to strengthen the ties with the Ukrainian diaspora overseas, and to reinvigorate the religious life of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church abroad. During these years he also took part in three international Eucharistic Congresses (Bombay, Bogota, Melbourne).\n\nIn 1977, Slipyj consecrated [[Ivan Choma]], [[Stefan Czmil]] and [[Lubomyr Husar]] as bishops without approval of the pope in an act of exposition of patriarchal aspirations. These consecrations caused much annoyance to the Roman Curia as episcopal consecrations without papal permission are considered illicit in Roman Canon Law but not Eastern Canon Law.<ref>[http://www.apostolische-nachfolge.de/Ukraine%20(English).htm Apostolische Nachfolge: Ukraine.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914213026/http://www.apostolische-nachfolge.de/Ukraine%20(English).htm |date=14 September 2017 }} German site of CSSp Province</ref>\n\nAs a Major Archbishop with Patriarchal rights, Slipyj gathered a number of synods of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. The most significant ones took place in 1969, 1971 and 1973. During the last Synod, the constitution of the UGCC patriarchal arrangement was adopted. Slipyj published his ordinances in \u201cEvangelicum of the Major Archbishop of the Byzantine-Ukrainian rite\u201d starting from 1964.\n\nIn Rome, he bought and rebuilt church of Saint Sergius and Bacchus for Ukrainian Catholics. On the territory of church both museum and hospice were founded.   In 1967-1968, the cathedral of Santa Sofia on Via Boccea was built in Rome at his orders.\n\nIn 1960 he revitalized the Ukrainian Theological Scientific Society in exile and restored the publishing of \u201cBohoslovia\u201d (Theology) in 1963 and the journal \u201cDzvony\u201d (Bells) in 1976.\n\nIn 1963 Slipyj organized the Ukrainian Catholic University of St. Clement with an academic publishing house.\n\n=== Death and burial ===\nAlthough Slipyj was banned from entering Ukraine by the leaders of the USSR, including Nikita Khrushchev, nevertheless he refused to give up his Soviet passport.\n\nHe died in Rome on 7 September 1984.<ref name=\"NYT Obit\">{{cite web |title=Josyf Cardinal Slipyj is Dead; Soviet Prisoner for 18 Years |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/08/obituaries/josyf-cardinal-slipyj-is-dead-soviet-prisioner-for-18-years.html |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=4 March 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The World Almanac and Book of Facts 1985 |date=1984 |publisher=Newspaper Enterprise Association, Inc. |location=New York |isbn=0-911818-71-5 |page=34}}</ref> After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], his [[relic]]s were [[Translation (relic)|returned]] to St. George's Cathedral in Lviv, and were reburied there August 27\u201329, 1992.\n\nHis cause for [[canonisation]] has been introduced at Rome.\n\n== Intellectual interests ==\nIn his research work he concentrated on approximating the scholasticism of Saint Thomas Aquinas to the requirements of Eastern Theology. Slipyj wrote a number of dogmatic works on the importance of the Holy Trinity, the origin of the Holy Spirit and Holy Sacraments, among which are:\n\n\u00b7      ''\u00abDie Trinitatslehre des byzantinischen Patriarchen Photios\u00bb'', 1921\n\n\u00b7      ''\u00abDe principo spirationis in SS.

It was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]].\n\nSome today regard ''The Shoes of the Fisherman'' as prophetic because it preceded by 15 years the election of Karol J\u00f3zef Wojty\u0142a as [[Pope John Paul II]], the first [[Slavs|Slavic]] pope as well as one from a [[Communist state|Communist nation]], noting even the Kiril/Karol similarity of names.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Sant'Atanasio]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book | author=[[Jaroslav Pelikan|Pelikan, Jaroslav]] | title=Confessor Between East and West | location=Grand Rapids | publisher=William B.

They are prevalent in Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent, particularly in [[India]].\n\nThe Indian subcontinent has seven principal mountain ranges and the largest of all is the Himalayas that lies in the northern part of India. The famous peaks and ranges include the [[Kangchenjunga]] range in the Eastern Himalayas which frames the hill stations of [[Darjeeling]] and [[Gangtok]] as well as the [[Nanda Devi]] in [[Uttarakhand]]. The Shivalik range that also lies within the same region also has some famous hill stations that include [[Mussoorie]], [[Dras]]s, [[Dalhousie, India|Dalhousie]], [[Kullu]], [[Shimla]], [[Nainital]] and many more.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nMost of the hill stations in India were developed by the British around a central mall to get respite from the oppressive summer heat. Many have picturesque lakes as their focal point, making them excellent places for boating activities.\n\nMost of the [[hill station]]s in India are located in [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[Manipur]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Uttarakhand]], [[Sikkim]], [[West Bengal]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Nagaland]] and [[Meghalaya]] in the Himalayas and in [[Maharashtra]], [[Karnataka]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]] in Western ghats.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://travelfiver.com/5-best-palaces-to-visit-in-rajasthan/ | title=5 Best Palaces to Visit in Rajasthan | publisher=TravelFiver | accessdate=27 October 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612185333/http://travelfiver.com/5-best-palaces-to-visit-in-rajasthan/ | archive-date=12 June 2018 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Some are located in Eastern ghats [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Odisha]]. Some of the hill stations in India are listed below by [[States of India|state]].\n\nSince a number of these hill stations attract large number of tourists in summer as well as other times of the year, they are well connected by rail, road and air services to major Indian cities.\n\n== History ==\n\nHill stations in [[British Raj|India]] were established for a variety of reasons. After the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|revolt of 1857]] the \"British sought further distance from what they saw as a \"[[first cholera pandemic (1817\u201324)|disease-ridden]]\" land by escape to the [[Himalayas]] in the north and [[Nilgiri mountains|Nilgiri Hills]] in the south\", a pattern which started even before 1857. Other factors included anxieties about the dangers of life in India, among them \"fear of degeneration brought on by too long residence in a debilitating land.\" The hill stations were meant to reproduce the home country, illustrated in [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton|Lord Lytton]]'s statement about [[Ooty|Ootacamund]], in the 1870s, \"such beautiful English rain, such delicious English mud.\"<ref name=\"MetcalfMetcalf2002\">{{cite book|author1=Barbara D.

The first settlements started in the 1820s, primarily as [[sanatorium|sanitoria]]. In the 1840s and 1850s, there was a wave of new hill stations, with the main impetus being \"places to rest and recuperate from the arduous life on the plains\". In the second half of the 19th century, there was a period of consolidation with few new hill stations. In the final phase, \"hill stations reached their zenith in the late nineteenth century. The political importance of the official stations was underscored by the inauguration of large and costly public-building projects.\"<ref name=\"kennedyDane\" />{{rp|14}}\n\n==Andhra Pradesh==\n\n[[File:Araku-valley-4 big.jpg|200px|thumbnail|[[Araku Valley]], Andhra Pradesh]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

They are prevalent in Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent, particularly in [[India]].\n\nThe Indian subcontinent has seven principal mountain ranges and the largest of all is the Himalayas that lies in the northern part of India. The famous peaks and ranges include the [[Kangchenjunga]] range in the Eastern Himalayas which frames the hill stations of [[Darjeeling]] and [[Gangtok]] as well as the [[Nanda Devi]] in [[Uttarakhand]]. The Shivalik range that also lies within the same region also has some famous hill stations that include [[Mussoorie]], [[Dras]]s, [[Dalhousie, India|Dalhousie]], [[Kullu]], [[Shimla]], [[Nainital]] and many more.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nMost of the hill stations in India were developed by the British around a central mall to get respite from the oppressive summer heat.

Some of the hill stations in India are listed below by [[States of India|state]].\n\nSince a number of these hill stations attract large number of tourists in summer as well as other times of the year, they are well connected by rail, road and air services to major Indian cities.\n\n== History ==\n\nHill stations in [[British Raj|India]] were established for a variety of reasons. After the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|revolt of 1857]] the \"British sought further distance from what they saw as a \"[[first cholera pandemic (1817\u201324)|disease-ridden]]\" land by escape to the [[Himalayas]] in the north and [[Nilgiri mountains|Nilgiri Hills]] in the south\", a pattern which started even before 1857. Other factors included anxieties about the dangers of life in India, among them \"fear of degeneration brought on by too long residence in a debilitating land.\" The hill stations were meant to reproduce the home country, illustrated in [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton|Lord Lytton]]'s statement about [[Ooty|Ootacamund]], in the 1870s, \"such beautiful English rain, such delicious English mud.\"<ref name=\"MetcalfMetcalf2002\">{{cite book|author1=Barbara D.

The first settlements started in the 1820s, primarily as [[sanatorium|sanitoria]]. In the 1840s and 1850s, there was a wave of new hill stations, with the main impetus being \"places to rest and recuperate from the arduous life on the plains\". In the second half of the 19th century, there was a period of consolidation with few new hill stations. In the final phase, \"hill stations reached their zenith in the late nineteenth century. The political importance of the official stations was underscored by the inauguration of large and costly public-building projects.\"<ref name=\"kennedyDane\" />{{rp|14}}\n\n==Andhra Pradesh==\n\n[[File:Araku-valley-4 big.jpg|200px|thumbnail|[[Araku Valley]], Andhra Pradesh]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Set on the colonized fictional planet of Theron in the future, where an alien race led by Gaudy have invaded the human-controlled location, players assume the role of an Allied League of Cosmic Nations (ALCON) fighter pilot taking control of the SW475 [[List of fictional spacecraft#Space fighters|space fighter]] craft in a effort to counterattack the invaders. Initially launched for the arcades, the game was later [[Porting#Porting in gaming|ported]] to other [[microcomputer]] and [[Home video game console|console]] platforms by various [[third-party developer]]s, with each one featuring several changes or additions compared to the original release.\n\n''Slap Fight'' proved to be popular for Toaplan among arcades players despite a low number of arcade boards manufactured in Japan, however it was met with mixed reception from video game magazines across western regions, specifically the home [[Video game conversion|conversion]]s. Although it never received a direct sequel, the game's ideas and weapon system were later inherited by both ''[[Truxton (video game)|Truxton]]'' and ''[[Grind Stormer]]'', with the latter being regarded as its [[spiritual successor]]. The rights to the title are owned by Tatsujin, a Japanese company formed by Masahiro Yuge.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:ARC Slap Fight (Alcon).png|thumb|left|Arcade version screenshot.]]\n''Slap Fight'' is a [[science fiction]]-themed vertically scrolling [[shoot 'em up]] game reminiscent of ''[[B-Wings]]'', where players assume the role of an Allied League of Cosmic Nations (ALCON) fighter pilot taking control of the SW475 space fighter craft in a counterattack effort to defeat an invading alien race led by Gaudy on planet Theron as the main objective.<ref name=\"SFMDmanual\">''Slap Fight MD'' manual (Sega Mega Drive, JP)</ref><ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\">{{cite web|last=Kalata|first=Kurt|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/slap-fight-alcon/|title=Slap Fight / ALCON|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=3 July 2011|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref><ref name=\"SFss\">{{cite web|url=http://shootingstar.game.coocan.jp/slap_fight.html|title=SLAP FIGHT|publisher=Shooting Star|access-date=2020-04-24|language=ja}}</ref> Besides some [[helicopter]]s taking off, there are no flying enemies in the entire game. As far as vertical scrolling shooters go, the title initially appears to be very standard, as players control their craft over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving until a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] at the end that must be fought before progressing any further is reached. Players have only two weapons at their disposal: the standard and side shots that travel a max distance of half the screen's height and length.<ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\"/><ref name=\"SFss\"/>\n\nThe game's weapon [[power-up]] system takes inspiration from ''[[Gradius]]'';<ref name=\"SFMDmanual\"/><ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\"/><ref name=\"SFss\"/> certain enemies spawn a [[star]]-shaped [[Item (gaming)|item]] upon destruction to be collected, activating an upgrade menu at the bottom of the screen that moves a lit cursor through the list of weapon power-ups described below.<ref name=\"SFMDmanual\"/><ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\"/><ref name=\"SFss\"/> However, activating any weapon power-up increases the ship's [[Collision detection#Hitbox|hitbox]], making it a bigger target for enemy fire and difficult to keep successive lives in the heat of battle.<ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\"/> If any power-up is lit but the player's ship is destroyed before a power-up could be selected, the star item is \"carried over\" and the speed power-up is lit on the next life. A number of hidden bonus secrets to be found are hosted, which is also crucial for reaching high-scores to obtain extra lives, as firing on determined locations and certain [[setpiece]]s within the scenery in some stages reveals a bonus secret.\n\nMajor weapons affect the enemies and terrain differently. For example, certain enemy towers can only be destroyed with laser or homing missile shots; other enemies are destroyed much faster with specific weapons to match. If [[bomb]] or homing missile shots are equipped, certain bonus targets will appear or parts of the landscape may be destroyed to reveal bonuses. If laser is active, certain plants in the landscape can be shot repeatedly to grow and earn extra points until they scroll off-screen.<ref name=\"SFss\"/> It has been reported that a bug in the game enabled the player to obtain all power-ups, simply by allowing themselves to be killed by the first enemy appearing upon starting the game without touching the controls. If this occurred, the next time the player's ship appears, it has all the power-ups equipped.<ref>{{cite web|author=smac|url=https://www.rllmukforum.com/index.php?/topic/76529-best-trick-cheat-or-bug-in-an-arcade-game/&do=findComment&comment=1735599|title=Best Trick, Cheat Or Bug In An Arcade Game..

After completing the last stage, the game begins again with the second loop increasing in difficulty and enemies fire denser [[bullet]] patterns. The title does not support continues with extra credits and is believed to loop endlessly.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe plot summary of ''Slap Fight'' varies between each region and version.<ref name=\"SFMDmanual\"/><ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\"/><ref name=\"SFss\"/><ref name=\"ALCONflyer\">''Alcon'' arcade flyer (Taito, US)</ref> The game takes place in the year 2059 on another galaxy, mankind has colonized an alien planet called Theon after evacuating a previously colonized planet Orac. Five years ago, the colony on Orac was attacked by alien invaders and the war was so intense, the colonists were forced to leave.

Although it never received a direct sequel, the game's ideas and weapon system were later inherited by both ''[[Truxton (video game)|Truxton]]'' and ''[[Grind Stormer]]'', with the latter being regarded as its [[spiritual successor]]. The rights to the title are owned by Tatsujin, a Japanese company formed by Masahiro Yuge.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:ARC Slap Fight (Alcon).png|thumb|left|Arcade version screenshot.]]\n''Slap Fight'' is a [[science fiction]]-themed vertically scrolling [[shoot 'em up]] game reminiscent of ''[[B-Wings]]'', where players assume the role of an Allied League of Cosmic Nations (ALCON) fighter pilot taking control of the SW475 space fighter craft in a counterattack effort to defeat an invading alien race led by Gaudy on planet Theron as the main objective.<ref name=\"SFMDmanual\">''Slap Fight MD'' manual (Sega Mega Drive, JP)</ref><ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\">{{cite web|last=Kalata|first=Kurt|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/slap-fight-alcon/|title=Slap Fight / ALCON|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=3 July 2011|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref><ref name=\"SFss\">{{cite web|url=http://shootingstar.game.coocan.jp/slap_fight.html|title=SLAP FIGHT|publisher=Shooting Star|access-date=2020-04-24|language=ja}}</ref> Besides some [[helicopter]]s taking off, there are no flying enemies in the entire game. As far as vertical scrolling shooters go, the title initially appears to be very standard, as players control their craft over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving until a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] at the end that must be fought before progressing any further is reached. Players have only two weapons at their disposal: the standard and side shots that travel a max distance of half the screen's height and length.<ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\"/><ref name=\"SFss\"/>\n\nThe game's weapon [[power-up]] system takes inspiration from ''[[Gradius]]'';<ref name=\"SFMDmanual\"/><ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\"/><ref name=\"SFss\"/> certain enemies spawn a [[star]]-shaped [[Item (gaming)|item]] upon destruction to be collected, activating an upgrade menu at the bottom of the screen that moves a lit cursor through the list of weapon power-ups described below.<ref name=\"SFMDmanual\"/><ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\"/><ref name=\"SFss\"/> However, activating any weapon power-up increases the ship's [[Collision detection#Hitbox|hitbox]], making it a bigger target for enemy fire and difficult to keep successive lives in the heat of battle.<ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\"/> If any power-up is lit but the player's ship is destroyed before a power-up could be selected, the star item is \"carried over\" and the speed power-up is lit on the next life. A number of hidden bonus secrets to be found are hosted, which is also crucial for reaching high-scores to obtain extra lives, as firing on determined locations and certain [[setpiece]]s within the scenery in some stages reveals a bonus secret.\n\nMajor weapons affect the enemies and terrain differently. For example, certain enemy towers can only be destroyed with laser or homing missile shots; other enemies are destroyed much faster with specific weapons to match. If [[bomb]] or homing missile shots are equipped, certain bonus targets will appear or parts of the landscape may be destroyed to reveal bonuses. If laser is active, certain plants in the landscape can be shot repeatedly to grow and earn extra points until they scroll off-screen.<ref name=\"SFss\"/> It has been reported that a bug in the game enabled the player to obtain all power-ups, simply by allowing themselves to be killed by the first enemy appearing upon starting the game without touching the controls. If this occurred, the next time the player's ship appears, it has all the power-ups equipped.<ref>{{cite web|author=smac|url=https://www.rllmukforum.com/index.php?/topic/76529-best-trick-cheat-or-bug-in-an-arcade-game/&do=findComment&comment=1735599|title=Best Trick, Cheat Or Bug In An Arcade Game..

After completing the last stage, the game begins again with the second loop increasing in difficulty and enemies fire denser [[bullet]] patterns.

Five years ago, the colony on Orac was attacked by alien invaders and the war was so intense, the colonists were forced to leave. However, Theon is now under attack by the same alien fleet, but the humans are ready.
