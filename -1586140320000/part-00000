According to non-cognitive versions of ethical subjectivism, such as emotivism, prescriptivism, and expressivism, ethical statements cannot be true or false, at all: rather, they are expressions of personal feelings or commands.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Sarin Marchetti|title=William James on Truth and Invention in Morality|journal=European Journal of Pragmatism and American Philosophy|issue=2|year=2010|doi=10.4000/ejpap.910|issn=2036-4091|oclc=664682806}}</ref> For example, on [[A.

This view holds that moral propositions are analogous to propositions about [[chemistry]], [[biology]], or [[history]], in so much as they are true despite what anyone believes, hopes, wishes, or feels. When they fail to describe this mind-independent moral reality, they are false\u2014no matter what anyone believes, hopes, wishes, or feels.\n\nThere are many versions of ethical objectivism, including various religious views of morality, Platonistic intuitionism, [[Kantianism]], [[utilitarianism]], and certain forms of [[ethical egoism]] and [[contractualism]]. Note that Platonists define ethical objectivism in an even more narrow way, so that it requires the existence of intrinsic value. Consequently, they reject the idea that contractualists or egoists could be ethical objectivists. Objectivism, in turn, places primacy on the origin of the frame of reference\u2014and, as such, considers any arbitrary frame of reference ultimately a form of ethical subjectivism by a transitive property, even when the frame incidentally coincides with reality and can be used for measurements.\n\n==Moral objectivism and relativism==\nMoral objectivism is the view that what is right or wrong doesn't depend on what anyone thinks is right or wrong. An example is the [[categorical imperative]] of  [[Immanuel Kant]] which says: \"Act only according to that maxim [i.e., rule] whereby you can at the same time will that it become a universal law.\" [[John Stuart Mill]] was a consequential thinker and therefore proposed [[utilitarianism]] which asserts that in any situation, the right thing to do is whatever is likely to produce the most happiness overall. When it comes to relativism, Russian philosopher and writer, [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], coined the phrase \"If God doesn't exist, everything is permissible\". That phrase was his view of the consequences for rejecting theism as a basis of ethics. American anthropologist [[Ruth Benedict]] argued that there is no single objective morality and that morality varies with culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucs.mun.ca/~alatus/phil1200/RelativismObjectivism.html|title=Moral Relativism and Objectivism|publisher=University of California, Santa Cruz|accessdate=20 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Philosophy}}\n*[[Factual relativism]]\n*[[Journalistic objectivity]]\n*[[Na\u00efve realism]]\n*[[Objectivity (science)]]\n*[[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[Gaston Bachelard|Bachelard, Gaston]].

According to cognitive versions of ethical subjectivism, the truth of moral statements depends upon people's values, attitudes, feelings, or beliefs. Some forms of cognitivist ethical subjectivism can be counted as forms of realism, others are forms of anti-realism.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Thomas P\u00f6lzler|title=How to Measure Moral Realism|journal=Review of Philosophy and Psychology|volume=9|issue=3|pages=647\u2013670|year=2018|doi=10.1007/s13164-018-0401-8|pmid=30220945|pmc=6132410}}</ref> [[David Hume]] is a foundational figure for cognitive ethical subjectivism.

According to non-cognitive versions of ethical subjectivism, such as emotivism, prescriptivism, and expressivism, ethical statements cannot be true or false, at all: rather, they are expressions of personal feelings or commands.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Sarin Marchetti|title=William James on Truth and Invention in Morality|journal=European Journal of Pragmatism and American Philosophy|issue=2|year=2010|doi=10.4000/ejpap.910|issn=2036-4091|oclc=664682806}}</ref> For example, on [[A.

This view holds that moral propositions are analogous to propositions about [[chemistry]], [[biology]], or [[history]], in so much as they are true despite what anyone believes, hopes, wishes, or feels. When they fail to describe this mind-independent moral reality, they are false\u2014no matter what anyone believes, hopes, wishes, or feels.\n\nThere are many versions of ethical objectivism, including various religious views of morality, Platonistic intuitionism, [[Kantianism]], [[utilitarianism]], and certain forms of [[ethical egoism]] and [[contractualism]]. Note that Platonists define ethical objectivism in an even more narrow way, so that it requires the existence of intrinsic value. Consequently, they reject the idea that contractualists or egoists could be ethical objectivists. Objectivism, in turn, places primacy on the origin of the frame of reference\u2014and, as such, considers any arbitrary frame of reference ultimately a form of ethical subjectivism by a transitive property, even when the frame incidentally coincides with reality and can be used for measurements.\n\n==Moral objectivism and relativism==\nMoral objectivism is the view that what is right or wrong doesn't depend on what anyone thinks is right or wrong. An example is the [[categorical imperative]] of  [[Immanuel Kant]] which says: \"Act only according to that maxim [i.e., rule] whereby you can at the same time will that it become a universal law.\" [[John Stuart Mill]] was a consequential thinker and therefore proposed [[utilitarianism]] which asserts that in any situation, the right thing to do is whatever is likely to produce the most happiness overall. When it comes to relativism, Russian philosopher and writer, [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], coined the phrase \"If God doesn't exist, everything is permissible\". That phrase was his view of the consequences for rejecting theism as a basis of ethics. American anthropologist [[Ruth Benedict]] argued that there is no single objective morality and that morality varies with culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucs.mun.ca/~alatus/phil1200/RelativismObjectivism.html|title=Moral Relativism and Objectivism|publisher=University of California, Santa Cruz|accessdate=20 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Philosophy}}\n*[[Factual relativism]]\n*[[Journalistic objectivity]]\n*[[Na\u00efve realism]]\n*[[Objectivity (science)]]\n*[[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[Gaston Bachelard|Bachelard, Gaston]].

One of the main reasons for Dunkin' Donuts' decline was competition with [[Tim Hortons]], similar to Tim Hortons' own decline in the northeastern United States due to heavy competition from Dunkin' Donuts. A group of Dunkin' Donuts franchisees won a C$16.4 million civil court judgement against the parent company for failing to adequately promote the brand in Canada.

The Japanese chain was owned by a joint venture between the Saison Group, [[Yoshinoya]], and the Japanese subsidiary of the [[Compass Group]] named Seiyo Food Systems. After 28 years of operating in Japan, Dunkin' Donuts ceased business there in 1998 due to declining sales and poor performance. All of the non-military base locations were either closed or converted to [[Mister Donut]] locations.
