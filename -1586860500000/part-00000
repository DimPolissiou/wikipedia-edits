Although the original idea of helicopter money describes central banks making payments directly to individuals, economists have used the term 'helicopter money' to refer to a wide range of different policy ideas, including the 'permanent' [[debt monetization|monetization of budget deficits]] \u2013 with the additional element of attempting to shock beliefs about future inflation or nominal GDP growth, in order to change expectations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2016/04/helicopter-money-is-permanent.html |title=Worthwhile Canadian Initiative|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref> A second set of policies, closer to the original description of helicopter money, and more innovative in the context of monetary history, involves the central bank making direct transfers to the private sector financed with base money, without the direct involvement of fiscal authorities.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2015/may/21/now-the-bank-of-england-needs-to-deliver-qe-for-the-people |title=Now the Bank of England needs to deliver QE for the people|first1=Mark|last1=Blyth |first2=Eric|last2=Lonergan |first3=Simon|last3=Wren-Lewis |date=21 May 2015|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/9/9/6122517/helicopter-drop-money-print-fed-blyth-lonergan |title=To fix the economy, let's print money and mail it to everyone|author=Dylan Matthews|date=15 May 2015|work=Vox|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref> This has also been called a [[citizens' dividend]] or a distribution of future [[seigniorage]].<ref>{{cite web|quote=Helicopter money is giving to the people part of the net present value of your future seigniorage, the profit you make on the future banknotes. |title=Interview with Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, conducted by Ferdinando Giugliano and Tonia Mastrobuoni on 15 March 2016 and published on 18 March 2016|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2016/html/sp160318.en.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20200216181909/https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/inter/date/2016/html/sp160318.en.html |archivedate=16 February 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe name \"helicopter money\" was first coined by [[Milton Friedman]] in 1969, when he wrote a parable of dropping money from a helicopter to illustrate the effects of monetary expansion. The concept was revived by economists as a monetary policy proposal in the early 2000s following Japan's [[Lost Decade (Japan)|Lost Decade]]. In November 2002, [[Ben Bernanke]], then [[Federal Reserve]] Board governor, and later chairman suggested that helicopter money could always be used to prevent deflation.\n\n== Origins ==\nAlthough very similar concepts have been previously defended by various people including [[Major Douglas]] and the [[Social Credit Movement]], Nobel winning economist [[Milton Friedman]] is known to be the one who coined the term 'helicopter money' in the now famous paper \"[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FwA7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT14&hl=ru&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=3 The Optimum Quantity of Money]\" (1969), where he included the following parable:\n\n<blockquote>Let us suppose now that one day a helicopter flies over this community and drops an additional $1,000 in bills from the sky, which is, of course, hastily collected by members of the community. Let us suppose further that everyone is convinced that this is a unique event which will never be repeated.</blockquote>\n\nOriginally used by Friedman to illustrate the effects of monetary policy on inflation and the costs of holding money, rather than an actual policy proposal, the concept has since then been increasingly discussed by economists as a serious alternative to monetary policy instruments such as [[quantitative easing]]. According to its proponents, helicopter money would be a more efficient way to increase aggregate demand, especially in a situation of [[liquidity trap]], when central banks have reached the so-called '[[zero lower bound]]'.\n\nFriedman himself refers to financing transfer payments with base money as evidence that monetary policy still has power when conventional policies have failed, in his discussion of the [[Pigou effect]], in his 1968 AER Presidential address.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://assets.aeaweb.org/assets/production/journals/aer/top20/58.1.1-17.pdf |title=The Role of Monetary Policy|journal=American Economic Review|author=[[Milton Friedman]]|volume=58|issue=1|date=March 1968|pp=1\u201317|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160605050134/https://assets.aeaweb.org/assets/production/journals/aer/top20/58.1.1-17.pdf |archivedate=2016-06-05}}</ref> Specifically, Friedman argues that \"[the] revival of belief in the potency of money policy ... was strongly fostered among economists by the theoretical developments initiated by Haberler but named for Pigou that pointed out a channel \u2013 namely changes in wealth \u2013 whereby changes in the real quantity of money can affect aggregate demand even if they do not alter interest rates.\" Friedman is clear that money must be produced \"in other ways\" than open-market operations, which \u2013 like QE \u2013 involve \"simply substituting money for other assets without changing total wealth.\" Friedman references a paper by Gottfried Haberler written in 1952, where Haberler says, \"Suppose the quantity of money is increased by tax reductions or government transfer payments, and the resulting deficit is financed by borrowing from the central bank or simply printing money\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Haberler|first=Gottfried |date=1952-01-01|title=The Pigou Effect Once More|jstor=1826454|journal=Journal of Political Economy |volume=60|issue=3|pages=240\u2013246 |doi=10.1086/257211}}</ref>\n\nIt is noteworthy in light of more recent debates over the separation between monetary and fiscal policy, that Friedman viewed these policies as evidence of the potency of monetary policy. In the same AER address, he is highly critical of the timeliness and efficacy of fiscal measures to stabilize demand.\n\nThe idea of helicopter drops was revived as a serious policy proposal in the early 2000s by economists considering the lessons from Japan. [[Ben Bernanke]] famously delivered a speech on preventing deflation in November 2002 as a Federal Reserve Board governor, where he says that Keynes \"once semi-seriously proposed, as an anti-deflationary measure, that the government fill bottles with currency and bury them in mine shafts to be dug up by the public.\" In that speech, Bernanke himself says, \"a money-financed tax cut is essentially equivalent to Milton Friedman's famous 'helicopter drop' of money.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/Speeches/2002/20021121/default.htm#f8 |title=Speech, Bernanke --Deflation-- November 21, 2002|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref> In a footnote to that speech, Bernanke also references an important paper by Gauti Eggertson which emphasizes the importance of a commitment from the central bank to keep the money supply at a higher level in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2003/wp0364.pdf |title=How to Fight Deflation in a Liquidity Trap: Committing to Being Irresponsible|work=IMF|type=Working Paper|author=Gauti B.

In 2013, the chairman of the UK's [[Financial Services Authority]] (FCA), [[Adair Turner]], who had been considered a serious candidate to succeed [[Mervyn King, Baron King of Lothbury|Mervyn King]] as Governor of the Bank of England, argued that deficit monetization is the fastest way to recover from the financial crisis in a speech.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/debt-money-and-mephistopheles-speech |title=Debt, Money, and Mephistopheles: How do we get out of this mess? - Speech|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Implementation ==\nAlthough the original definition of helicopter money describes a situation where central banks distribute cash directly to individuals, more modern use of the term refer to other possibilities, such as granting a universal tax rebate to all households, financed by the central bank. This is, for example, what the United States did with the [[Economic Stimulus Act of 2008]]. The use of tax rebates explains why some consider helicopter money as a fiscal stimulus as opposed to a monetary policy tool. Helicopter money, however, is not meant to be permanent, and is therefore a different policy option than universal basic income.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://basicincome.org/news/2017/03/helicopter-money-basic-income-friends-or-foes/ |title=Helicopter money and basic income: friends or foes? {{!}} Basic Income News|last=|first= |date=2017-03-25|work=Basic Income News|access-date=2017-04-10|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nUnder a strict definition, where helicopter drops are simply transfers from the central bank to the private sector financed with base money a number of economists have argued that they are already occurring.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/03/17/central-banks-are-already-doing-the-unthinkable---you-just-dont/ |title=Central banks are already doing the unthinkable - you just don't know it|author=Mehreen Khan|date=19 March 2016|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref> In 2016, the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) launched a [[TLTRO]] programme lending money to banks at negative interest rates, which amounts to a transfer to banks. Also, the use of differential interest rates on tiered reserves to support commercial banks' profitability in the face of negative interest rates, opens up another source of helicopter drop - albeit intermediated by banks.<ref>{{cite web|quote=Central banks have ways to drop money into ailing economies. |title=Free lunch: Helicopter engineering, published on 16 February 29 2016|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/3/914fae3e-dec6-11e5-b072-006d8d362ba3.html#axzz45kZzwC6m }}</ref>\n\nIn the case of the Eurozone, the use of [http://bruegel.org/2014/09/t-ltro-variation-on-a-ecbs-theme/ TLTROs] is believed by some economists to provide a legal and administratively tractable means of introducing transfers to households.<ref name=\"bruegel.org\">{{cite web|url=http://bruegel.org/2016/03/helicopter-drops-reloaded/ |title=Helicopter drops reloaded|publisher=breugel.org|author1=H\u00fcttl, Pia |author2=Alvaro Leandro |date=March 14, 2016|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref> The economist, Eric Lonergan, argued in 2016 that legal helicopter drops in the Eurozone could be structured via zero coupon, perpetual loans, which all European adult citizens would be eligible to receive. The loans could be administered by eligible commercial banks, and under certain conditions the loans would be net interest income positive to the central bank.<ref>{{cite web|title=Legal helicopter drops in the Eurozone, published on February 24 2016|url=https://www.philosophyofmoney.net/legal-helicopter-drops-in-the-eurozone/}}</ref> This idea was revived in 2019 by [[Frances Coppola]], in her book, The Case for People\u2019s Quantitative Easing, and also by researchers at [[BlackRock]], including Stanley Fischer, and also by the French economist Jean Pisani-Ferry.\n\n== Controversies ==\n\nMany economists would argue that helicopter money, in the form of cash transfers to households, should not be seen as a substitute for fiscal policy. Given the government's borrowing costs are extremely low at close to zero interest rates, conventional fiscal stimulus through tax cuts and infrastructure spending should work. From this perspective, helicopter money is really an insurance policy against the failure of fiscal policy for political, legal or institutional reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mainlymacro.blogspot.co.uk/2016/03/two-related-confusions-about-helicopter.html |title=mainly macro|author=Mainly Macro|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016|date=March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Differences from quantitative easing===\nLike all expansionary [[monetary policy|monetary policies]] in general, [[quantitative easing]] (QE) and helicopter money involves money creation by central banks to expand the money supply. However, the effect on the central bank's balance sheet of helicopter money is different than with QE. Under QE, central banks create reserves by purchasing bonds or other financial assets, conducting an '[[asset swap]]'.<ref name=Grenville2013>{{cite web |last1=Grenville |first1=Stephen |title=Helicopter money |url=https://voxeu.org/article/helicopter-money |website=VoxEU.org  |publisher=[[Centre for Economic Policy Research]] |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20190920074154/https://voxeu.org/article/helicopter-money |archivedate=20 September 2019 |date=24 February 2013 |url-status=live |quote=Central banks have no mandate to give money away (they can only exchange one asset for another, as they do in quantitative easing)}}</ref> The swap is reversible. By contrast, with helicopter money, central banks give away the money created, without increasing assets on their balance sheet.\n\nEconomists argue that the effect on expectations is different because helicopter money created would be perceived as 'permanent' \u2013 that is, more irreversible than QE. Economists have pointed out that the effect is not different from a combination of expansionary fiscal policy and expansionary monetary policy conducted at the same time.\n\n===Implications for central bank balance sheets===\nOne of the main concerns with transfers from the central bank directly to the private sector is that in contrast to conventional [[open-market operations]] the central bank does not have an asset corresponding to the base money created. This has implications for the measured equity of the central bank because base money is typically treated as a liability, but it could also constrain the central bank's ability to set interest rates in the future. The accounting treatment of central banks' balance sheets is controversial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ft.com/economistsforum/2012/06/governments-can-borrow-without-increasing-their-debt/ |title=Governments can borrow without increasing their debt|work=Financial Times|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref> Most economists now recognize that the 'capital' of the central bank is not really important.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp392.pdf?e7bba27cdd7b653529fc35400ff0a3c0 | title=The Role of Central Bank Capital Revisited | publisher=European Central Bank | date=September 2004 | author=Ulrich Bindseil|author2=Andres Manzanares|author3=Benedict Weller | issn=1725-2806}}</ref> What matters is can whether expansion of base money be reversed in the future, or are there other means to raise interest rates. Various options have been proposed. Oxford professor, Simon Wren-Lewis has suggested that the government pre-commit to providing the Bank of England with bonds if needed. The European Central Bank can, in fact, mandate an increase in its capital, and the introduction of [[tiered reserves]] and [[interest on reserves]] gives central banks an array of tools to protect their own net income and the demand for reserves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophyofmoney.net/does-the-central-banks-balance-sheet-matter/ |title=Does the central bank's balance sheet matter?|author=Eric Lonergan|work=Philosophy of Money|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Supporters ==\nFormer chairman of the Federal Reserve [[Ben Bernanke]] is known to be one of the proponents of helicopter money when he gave a speech in November 2002 arguing, in the case of Japan, that \"a money-financed tax cut is essentially equivalent to Milton Friedman's famous 'helicopter drop' of money.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/Speeches/2002/20021121/default.htm |title=Speech, Bernanke --Deflation-- November 21, 2002|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref> In April 2016, Ben Bernanke wrote a blog post arguing that \"such programs may be the best available alternative.

The concept was revived by economists as a monetary policy proposal in the early 2000s following Japan's [[Lost Decade (Japan)|Lost Decade]]. In November 2002, [[Ben Bernanke]], then [[Federal Reserve]] Board governor, and later chairman suggested that helicopter money could always be used to prevent deflation.\n\n== Origins ==\nAlthough very similar concepts have been previously defended by various people including [[Major Douglas]] and the [[Social Credit Movement]], Nobel winning economist [[Milton Friedman]] is known to be the one who coined the term 'helicopter money' in the now famous paper \"[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FwA7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT14&hl=ru&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=3 The Optimum Quantity of Money]\" (1969), where he included the following parable:\n\n<blockquote>Let us suppose now that one day a helicopter flies over this community and drops an additional $1,000 in bills from the sky, which is, of course, hastily collected by members of the community. Let us suppose further that everyone is convinced that this is a unique event which will never be repeated.</blockquote>\n\nOriginally used by Friedman to illustrate the effects of monetary policy on inflation and the costs of holding money, rather than an actual policy proposal, the concept has since then been increasingly discussed by economists as a serious alternative to monetary policy instruments such as [[quantitative easing]]. According to its proponents, helicopter money would be a more efficient way to increase aggregate demand, especially in a situation of [[liquidity trap]], when central banks have reached the so-called '[[zero lower bound]]'.\n\nFriedman himself refers to financing transfer payments with base money as evidence that monetary policy still has power when conventional policies have failed, in his discussion of the [[Pigou effect]], in his 1968 AER Presidential address.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://assets.aeaweb.org/assets/production/journals/aer/top20/58.1.1-17.pdf |title=The Role of Monetary Policy|journal=American Economic Review|author=[[Milton Friedman]]|volume=58|issue=1|date=March 1968|pp=1\u201317|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160605050134/https://assets.aeaweb.org/assets/production/journals/aer/top20/58.1.1-17.pdf |archivedate=2016-06-05}}</ref> Specifically, Friedman argues that \"[the] revival of belief in the potency of money policy ... was strongly fostered among economists by the theoretical developments initiated by Haberler but named for Pigou that pointed out a channel \u2013 namely changes in wealth \u2013 whereby changes in the real quantity of money can affect aggregate demand even if they do not alter interest rates.\" Friedman is clear that money must be produced \"in other ways\" than open-market operations, which \u2013 like QE \u2013 involve \"simply substituting money for other assets without changing total wealth.\" Friedman references a paper by Gottfried Haberler written in 1952, where Haberler says, \"Suppose the quantity of money is increased by tax reductions or government transfer payments, and the resulting deficit is financed by borrowing from the central bank or simply printing money\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Haberler|first=Gottfried |date=1952-01-01|title=The Pigou Effect Once More|jstor=1826454|journal=Journal of Political Economy |volume=60|issue=3|pages=240\u2013246 |doi=10.1086/257211}}</ref>\n\nIt is noteworthy in light of more recent debates over the separation between monetary and fiscal policy, that Friedman viewed these policies as evidence of the potency of monetary policy. In the same AER address, he is highly critical of the timeliness and efficacy of fiscal measures to stabilize demand.\n\nThe idea of helicopter drops was revived as a serious policy proposal in the early 2000s by economists considering the lessons from Japan. [[Ben Bernanke]] famously delivered a speech on preventing deflation in November 2002 as a Federal Reserve Board governor, where he says that Keynes \"once semi-seriously proposed, as an anti-deflationary measure, that the government fill bottles with currency and bury them in mine shafts to be dug up by the public.\" In that speech, Bernanke himself says, \"a money-financed tax cut is essentially equivalent to Milton Friedman's famous 'helicopter drop' of money.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/Speeches/2002/20021121/default.htm#f8 |title=Speech, Bernanke --Deflation-- November 21, 2002|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref> In a footnote to that speech, Bernanke also references an important paper by Gauti Eggertson which emphasizes the importance of a commitment from the central bank to keep the money supply at a higher level in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2003/wp0364.pdf |title=How to Fight Deflation in a Liquidity Trap: Committing to Being Irresponsible|work=IMF|type=Working Paper|author=Gauti B.

In 2013, the chairman of the UK's [[Financial Services Authority]] (FCA), [[Adair Turner]], who had been considered a serious candidate to succeed [[Mervyn King, Baron King of Lothbury|Mervyn King]] as Governor of the Bank of England, argued that deficit monetization is the fastest way to recover from the financial crisis in a speech.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/debt-money-and-mephistopheles-speech |title=Debt, Money, and Mephistopheles: How do we get out of this mess? - Speech|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Implementation ==\nAlthough the original definition of helicopter money describes a situation where central banks distribute cash directly to individuals, more modern use of the term refer to other possibilities, such as granting a universal tax rebate to all households, financed by the central bank. This is, for example, what the United States did with the [[Economic Stimulus Act of 2008]]. The use of tax rebates explains why some consider helicopter money as a fiscal stimulus as opposed to a monetary policy tool. Helicopter money, however, is not meant to be permanent, and is therefore a different policy option than universal basic income.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://basicincome.org/news/2017/03/helicopter-money-basic-income-friends-or-foes/ |title=Helicopter money and basic income: friends or foes? {{!}} Basic Income News|last=|first= |date=2017-03-25|work=Basic Income News|access-date=2017-04-10|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nUnder a strict definition, where helicopter drops are simply transfers from the central bank to the private sector financed with base money a number of economists have argued that they are already occurring.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/03/17/central-banks-are-already-doing-the-unthinkable---you-just-dont/ |title=Central banks are already doing the unthinkable - you just don't know it|author=Mehreen Khan|date=19 March 2016|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref> In 2016, the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) launched a [[TLTRO]] programme lending money to banks at negative interest rates, which amounts to a transfer to banks.

Given the government's borrowing costs are extremely low at close to zero interest rates, conventional fiscal stimulus through tax cuts and infrastructure spending should work. From this perspective, helicopter money is really an insurance policy against the failure of fiscal policy for political, legal or institutional reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mainlymacro.blogspot.co.uk/2016/03/two-related-confusions-about-helicopter.html |title=mainly macro|author=Mainly Macro|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016|date=March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Differences from quantitative easing===\nLike all expansionary [[monetary policy|monetary policies]] in general, [[quantitative easing]] (QE) and helicopter money involves money creation by central banks to expand the money supply. However, the effect on the central bank's balance sheet of helicopter money is different than with QE. Under QE, central banks create reserves by purchasing bonds or other financial assets, conducting an '[[asset swap]]'.<ref name=Grenville2013>{{cite web |last1=Grenville |first1=Stephen |title=Helicopter money |url=https://voxeu.org/article/helicopter-money |website=VoxEU.org  |publisher=[[Centre for Economic Policy Research]] |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20190920074154/https://voxeu.org/article/helicopter-money |archivedate=20 September 2019 |date=24 February 2013 |url-status=live |quote=Central banks have no mandate to give money away (they can only exchange one asset for another, as they do in quantitative easing)}}</ref> The swap is reversible. By contrast, with helicopter money, central banks give away the money created, without increasing assets on their balance sheet.\n\nEconomists argue that the effect on expectations is different because helicopter money created would be perceived as 'permanent' \u2013 that is, more irreversible than QE. Economists have pointed out that the effect is not different from a combination of expansionary fiscal policy and expansionary monetary policy conducted at the same time.\n\n===Implications for central bank balance sheets===\nOne of the main concerns with transfers from the central bank directly to the private sector is that in contrast to conventional [[open-market operations]] the central bank does not have an asset corresponding to the base money created. This has implications for the measured equity of the central bank because base money is typically treated as a liability, but it could also constrain the central bank's ability to set interest rates in the future. The accounting treatment of central banks' balance sheets is controversial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ft.com/economistsforum/2012/06/governments-can-borrow-without-increasing-their-debt/ |title=Governments can borrow without increasing their debt|work=Financial Times|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref> Most economists now recognize that the 'capital' of the central bank is not really important.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp392.pdf?e7bba27cdd7b653529fc35400ff0a3c0 | title=The Role of Central Bank Capital Revisited | publisher=European Central Bank | date=September 2004 | author=Ulrich Bindseil|author2=Andres Manzanares|author3=Benedict Weller | issn=1725-2806}}</ref> What matters is can whether expansion of base money be reversed in the future, or are there other means to raise interest rates. Various options have been proposed. Oxford professor, Simon Wren-Lewis has suggested that the government pre-commit to providing the Bank of England with bonds if needed. The European Central Bank can, in fact, mandate an increase in its capital, and the introduction of [[tiered reserves]] and [[interest on reserves]] gives central banks an array of tools to protect their own net income and the demand for reserves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophyofmoney.net/does-the-central-banks-balance-sheet-matter/ |title=Does the central bank's balance sheet matter?|author=Eric Lonergan|work=Philosophy of Money|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Supporters ==\nFormer chairman of the Federal Reserve [[Ben Bernanke]] is known to be one of the proponents of helicopter money when he gave a speech in November 2002 arguing, in the case of Japan, that \"a money-financed tax cut is essentially equivalent to Milton Friedman's famous 'helicopter drop' of money.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/Speeches/2002/20021121/default.htm |title=Speech, Bernanke --Deflation-- November 21, 2002|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref> In April 2016, Ben Bernanke wrote a blog post arguing that \"such programs may be the best available alternative.

In the original Japanese version, Tohru Naruse goes by his nickname Naruchiyo and is often associated with a monkey, serving as a mascot to the team. Nate is a perennial bench-warmer. Lacking in both coolness and talent, he is the most unlikely basketball player. But through persistence and support from his friends, Nate slowly teaches himself the art of basketball. In the process, he slowly builds up his confidence and begins to realize his dream of success on the high school basketball court. He also develops feelings for Mizzy Kusuda, an ex-classmate, but later falls for another girl named Tomomi Koizumi. His signature move in basketball is known as the airwalk. Nate incorporated many flashy moves into his game, such as his signature airwalk, evolved lay-up (double-clutch) miracle J, and his invincible lay-ups. Every single one of these skills are pulled off subconsciously, indicating a preternatural natural talent for the sport.\n*'''Mizzy Kusuda''' ({{nihongo|'''Mizuki Kusuda'''|\u6960\u7530 \u307f\u305a\u304d|''Kusuda Mizuki''}} Japanese version) -  Mizuki is Nate's ex-classmate and close friend when he was in the primary school. She helps Nate succeed, teaching him the down and dirty side to street ball: no rules, no fouls, and no crying, she teaches him how to win. Eventually, she revealed to Shurman that she was in love with him ever since she first met him under his street name, which was Shoe. Her love was not returned, however, with Shurman saying that Shoe was gone.\n*'''Kyle \"Oz\" Ozman''' ({{nihongo|'''K\u014dsuke Ozaki'''|\u5c3e\u5d0e \u6d69\u4ecb|''Ozaki K\u014dsuke''}} Japanese version) - Kyle is a tough kid, high school drop-out with an axe to grind with everyone. But often his bark is worse than his bite. He and Nate are the only two players in the history of street hoops to ever score on the powerhouse team, 3-Slam. When they get together with Mizzy, Team Scratch is born. Oz is a hoodlum from the streets. He hangs with a rough crowd, and he brings the same attitude to the courts. Nate, his own teammate, is even scared of him. Throughout the series, Kyle has a crush on Mizzy, which eventually develops into love. He is also not very good when it comes to girls.\n*{{nihongo|'''Masahiro Sawamura'''|\u6fa4\u6751 \u6b63\u535a|''Sawamura Masahiro''}} - He is also a member of Scratch. He is Naruse's best friend. Sawamura plays street basketball to earn money as he lives by himself. He likes money very much and as a result turns towards gambling. His affinity to risk explains his constant attempts to sink only the three-point shots. He stole a score from Three Men by his tricks. He is the best three-point shooter and called a \"Miracle Shooter\". He is not good in stamina, but he is very good at tricks. His famous nickname is Fox (Kitsune) Guy, as he is really tricky and loves gambling. He is a clever guy too. His only weaknesses are money and ghosts. In a flashback, it is revealed that Sawamura's father abandoned him and he was soon picked up by a Yakuza member named Fujita. Fujita taught him how to fight, including the ways of the streets. After Fujita was shot by one of his own, he was captured and confined, leaving Sawamura to live on his own.\n* '''Shurman Shuji''' ({{nihongo|'''Sh\u016bji Sakurai'''|\u685c\u4e95 \u4fee\u53f8|''Sakurai Sh\u016bji''}}) - Shurman is considered to be a \"big brother\" in the Johnan team.

In the original Japanese version, Tohru Naruse goes by his nickname Naruchiyo and is often associated with a monkey, serving as a mascot to the team. Nate is a perennial bench-warmer. Lacking in both coolness and talent, he is the most unlikely basketball player. But through persistence and support from his friends, Nate slowly teaches himself the art of basketball. In the process, he slowly builds up his confidence and begins to realize his dream of success on the high school basketball court. He also develops feelings for Mizzy Kusuda, an ex-classmate, but later falls for another girl named Tomomi Koizumi. His signature move in basketball is known as the airwalk. Nate incorporated many flashy moves into his game, such as his signature airwalk, evolved lay-up (double-clutch) miracle J, and his invincible lay-ups. Every single one of these skills are pulled off subconsciously, indicating a preternatural natural talent for the sport.\n*'''Mizzy Kusuda''' ({{nihongo|'''Mizuki Kusuda'''|\u6960\u7530 \u307f\u305a\u304d|''Kusuda Mizuki''}} Japanese version) -  Mizuki is Nate's ex-classmate and close friend when he was in the primary school. She helps Nate succeed, teaching him the down and dirty side to street ball: no rules, no fouls, and no crying, she teaches him how to win. Eventually, she revealed to Shurman that she was in love with him ever since she first met him under his street name, which was Shoe. Her love was not returned, however, with Shurman saying that Shoe was gone.\n*'''Kyle \"Oz\" Ozman''' ({{nihongo|'''K\u014dsuke Ozaki'''|\u5c3e\u5d0e \u6d69\u4ecb|''Ozaki K\u014dsuke''}} Japanese version) - Kyle is a tough kid, high school drop-out with an axe to grind with everyone. But often his bark is worse than his bite. He and Nate are the only two players in the history of street hoops to ever score on the powerhouse team, 3-Slam. When they get together with Mizzy, Team Scratch is born. Oz is a hoodlum from the streets. He hangs with a rough crowd, and he brings the same attitude to the courts. Nate, his own teammate, is even scared of him. Throughout the series, Kyle has a crush on Mizzy, which eventually develops into love. He is also not very good when it comes to girls.\n*{{nihongo|'''Masahiro Sawamura'''|\u6fa4\u6751 \u6b63\u535a|''Sawamura Masahiro''}} - He is also a member of Scratch. He is Naruse's best friend. Sawamura plays street basketball to earn money as he lives by himself. He likes money very much and as a result turns towards gambling. His affinity to risk explains his constant attempts to sink only the three-point shots. He stole a score from Three Men by his tricks. He is the best three-point shooter and called a \"Miracle Shooter\". He is not good in stamina, but he is very good at tricks. His famous nickname is Fox (Kitsune) Guy, as he is really tricky and loves gambling. He is a clever guy too. His only weaknesses are money and ghosts. In a flashback, it is revealed that Sawamura's father abandoned him and he was soon picked up by a Yakuza member named Fujita. Fujita taught him how to fight, including the ways of the streets. After Fujita was shot by one of his own, he was captured and confined, leaving Sawamura to live on his own.\n* '''Shurman Shuji''' ({{nihongo|'''Sh\u016bji Sakurai'''|\u685c\u4e95 \u4fee\u53f8|''Sakurai Sh\u016bji''}}) - Shurman is considered to be a \"big brother\" in the Johnan team.

He has played a significant role in the development of the \"Denver Sound\", music that mixes elements of [[country music|country]], [[Gothic rock|gothic]], [[Folk music|folk]] and [[gospel music|gospel]]. He is a current member of [[Slim Cessna's Auto Club]], Munly and the Lupercalians, and Denver Broncos UK (DBUK). He was the leader of Munly and the Lee Lewis Harlots from approximately 2000 to 2006. \n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood and upbringing ===\n\nMunly was born and raised [[Quebec, Canada]] in a \"stereotypical Catholic family\"<ref name=\"Munly on Vera\">{{cite news |last1=Forman |first1=Bill |title=Wulf at the door |url=https://m.csindy.com/coloradosprings/wulf-at-the-door/Content?oid=1974001 |accessdate=March 26, 2020 |work=Colorado Springs Indy |publisher=Colorado Springs Independent |date=December 23, 2010 |ref=Munly on Vera}}</ref> with two parents and two siblings \u2013 one brother<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\">{{cite news |last1=Solomon |first1=Jon |title=Munly talks Slim Cessna's Auto Club's new album and seeing Billy Bragg for the first time |url=https://www.westword.com/music/munly-talks-slim-cessnas-auto-clubs-new-album-and-seeing-billy-bragg-for-the-first-time-5719289 |accessdate=March 23, 2020 |work=Westword |date=December 27, 2012 |ref=Munly Acting Westword}}</ref> and one sister.<ref name=\"Munly ORH\">{{cite news |title=Munly Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots |url=https://archive.org/details/OutsightRadioHoursInterviews2000-2010/KramerEddie.rm |accessdate=April 5, 2020 |work=Outsight Radio Hours |issue=Interview No. 252 |publisher=Archive.org |date=October 26, 2004 |ref=Munly ORH}}</ref><ref name=\"Coolstreams\">{{cite web |title=CoolStreams Internet Radio \u2013 Jay Munly |url=http://musicsojourn.com/AR/Alt/page/m/MunlyJay.htm |website=musicsojourn.com |accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nHe was a well-behaved child growing up, rarely getting into trouble.

In a 2009 interview, he said that he identifies with being an American from Denver more than being a Canadian from Quebec.<ref name=\"Crawdaddy\" />\n\n===Interest in ice hockey===\n\nTaking interest in [[ice hockey]] as a young man in Canada, Munly grew up a [[Montreal Canadiens]] fan.\n\nHe played hockey as a child in Canada and the U.S. before a related injury side-lined him. In a 2012 interview with [[Westword]], he says that his brother took him to the [[Bob Johnson (ice hockey, born 1931)|Bob Johnson]] ice hockey school to play.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\n===Interest in music===\n\nHis interest in music initially stemmed from boredom as he was recovering from an ice hockey injury. He also had some familial ties: his father and grandfather owned and played banjos. His father also made a [[dulcimer]] for his mother as a gift, although she did not play it.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nWhile recuperating from said injury, Munly taught himself how to play his father's 19th century-era [[banjo]], which was technically off-limits to handle.<ref name=\"Munly on Vera\" /> He would eventually teach himself to play the guitar as well.\n\n==Musical process==\n\n===Approach to songwriting===\n\nMunly is the chief songwriter for both his solo endeavors and side projects. It is a role that he is happy to take on by himself, believing that a band's success is dependent on playing to individual strengths rather than collaboration with members on each part of an album's creation.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" />\n\nHe says that he is \"selfish\" with his written material and serious about lyrical preservation.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\nHe expanded on his way of thinking in a 2019 interview with Sadwave, a Russian publication:\n\n{{quote|''\"From the very beginning, I understand where and why I'm writing a song. There is no complicated science. When you have been doing this for so many years, you bring the skill to automatism. I can start with a melody, but I can with a text \u2013 I always have a lot of words, I write a lot. I constantly find common themes in my songs, but I never had the feeling that I was working on a pattern. It would be immoral and unnatural, and I would not want to. I have characters who constantly come back, wander from song to song. But I try to change the angle, write on behalf of different people. On behalf of all sad people.\"''<ref name=\"Munly Sadwave\">{{cite news |last1=Kurkin |first1=Dmitry |title=Jay Manley [sic] (DBUK): 'I try to write on behalf of all sad people' |url=https://sadwave.com/2019/02/jay-munli/ |accessdate=April 5, 2020 |work=sad wave |date=February 8, 2019 |ref=Munly Sadwave}}</ref>}}\n\n===Musical themes and genres===\n\nHis music has ties to [[alt-country]] and [[Gothabilly|Gothic-Americana]]. Common themes include religion, violence and dysfunctional relationships; often they are intertwined. His increasingly narrative songs often feature banjo and, since the recording of his fourth album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', strings.\n\nOne topic that Munly deliberately does not write about is politics, since he \"hates\" music that veers into that kind of territory.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he admits that the stories and songs that he writes can be applied to real-world events in a way that coincidentally fits.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" />\n\n===Controversy===\n\nAs stated in a few interviews, people have found some of Munly's material controversial and politically incorrect. It is important to note that in most cases, the words and phrases used (as well as the views they represent) are that of the fictional characters that Munly creates, not of Munly himself.\n\nExamples:\n\n* ''\"Boys with tattoos can't be Jews\"'' \u2013 from \"Kidneys Running Dry\" on ''Blurry'' (1996)<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /><ref name=\"KRD Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Munly \u2013 Kidneys Running Dry |url=https://genius.com/Munly-kidneys-running-dry-lyrics?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=bd3ae05fe6c1e2a47c4f0713ffa5a16e71fce6fd-1586308658-0-AacccNM6Up3QUKAwcxWr7moI6buvh28pOpYPxYODrvwTY_F1arxPxbTRgSuWyl4Xdp0ySY_ZseZwWCStv8dumtz5AhmL5llOOnD9_3dv6-XTquwykYgduqCixdMk01PstYrSa8KQZi4SK3emYdNuLlbX4RFCHJbwQ1YRExOJjd6dkKD1_GHgcdfYYDe-vTJWI1uyX_0R8Q64ZevT3n-7A-7f2-ifsSZoF6J2JCq_RT2aMwKoWBxbHjarJrGdvNiZWwohYzH2ba2tN14wf2PwTXEzsdbFCgp-hDaOKuoeEYASB7ZBgYOJT_5LMn8GQ2PkKSfxVXNgggJO-I6ajZK3bMX27bSVAiYaqRheMbR_klyaHJvQPTQvRxAPyOR5CZ1c9A |website=Genius |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=KRD Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[a] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"My Darling Sambo\" \u2013 the first track title on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"JCS Amazon\">{{cite web |title=MUNLY, JAY \u2013 Jimmy Carter Syndrome |url=https://www.amazon.com/Jimmy-Carter-Syndrome-JAY-MUNLY/dp/B000BKWZOI |website=Amazon Music |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=JCS Amazon}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[b] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Paint your blackface/Yeah, won't you put me in your anteroom case/I'll be your n***er/On stage\"'' \u2013 from \"Censer from the Footlights\" on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"CFTF Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Jay Munly \u2013 Censer from the Footlights Lyrics |url=http://www.songlyrics.com/jay-munly/censer-from-the-footlights-lyrics/ |website=SongLyrics |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=CFTF Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[c] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[d] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[e] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[f] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Then we found ourselves a half-breed/To tell us our fortune today/He painted my hands a deep, dark red/Said 'now boy, you know that you gotta pay'\"'' \u2013 from \"Goose Walking Over My Grave\" on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"Munly Birds\">{{cite news |last1=Bradley |first1=Lisa M. |title=A Crack in Its Speak: Fantastic Birds in the Gothic Country Lyrics of Jay Munly |url=http://stonetelling.com/issue8-aug2012/bradley-speak.html |accessdate=April 6, 2020 |work=Stone Telling |issue=Issue No. 8 |date=August 2012 |ref=Munly Birds}}</ref><ref name=\"Goose Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Lyrics \u2013 Goose Walking Over My Grave |url=https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Munly-The-Lee-Lewis-Harlots/Goose-Walking-Over-My-Grave |website=Musixmatch |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=Goose Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[g] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"Cassius Castrato The She-Male of the Men's Prison\" \u2013 the fifth track title on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"LLH Album\">{{cite web |title=Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots |url=https://slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com/collections/munly/products/munly-the-lee-lewis-harlots |website=slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=LLH Album}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[h] ]]</sup>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Solo career===\n\nIn the 1990s, Munly started out his music career as a solo artist.

He also shared a 7-inch vinyl album with [[Roger Manning]].<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" />\n\nHe released his debut solo album, ''Blurry'', in 1996 through Top Notch, an imprint of [[What Are Records?]]. ''Munly de Dar He'' and ''Galvanized Yankee'' were also released through Top Notch in 1997 and 1999, respectively. His fourth and final solo album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', was released through [[Alternative Tentacles]] in 2002. Each of these albums were re-mastered by Bob Ferbrache and re-released as limited editions through Smooch Records in 2006. Only 1,000 copies of each were printed.\n\nHe has worked with several musicians that are featured on his albums, such as John Ellison of The Reejers and Chris Mars of The Replacements.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he makes a point of not listing the exact musical contributions of each member in liner notes, preferring the simplicity of the 'Modern Library book' aesthetic.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nAlthough Munly is the primary vocalist and lyricist on each of his albums, he hesitates to call himself a \"singer-songwriter\":\n\n''{{quote|\"It's kind of rough being a solo artist.

He has played a significant role in the development of the \"Denver Sound\", music that mixes elements of [[country music|country]], [[Gothic rock|gothic]], [[Folk music|folk]] and [[gospel music|gospel]]. He is a current member of [[Slim Cessna's Auto Club]], Munly and the Lupercalians, and Denver Broncos UK (DBUK). He was the leader of Munly and the Lee Lewis Harlots from approximately 2000 to 2006. \n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood and upbringing ===\n\nMunly was born and raised [[Quebec, Canada]] in a \"stereotypical Catholic family\"<ref name=\"Munly on Vera\">{{cite news |last1=Forman |first1=Bill |title=Wulf at the door |url=https://m.csindy.com/coloradosprings/wulf-at-the-door/Content?oid=1974001 |accessdate=March 26, 2020 |work=Colorado Springs Indy |publisher=Colorado Springs Independent |date=December 23, 2010 |ref=Munly on Vera}}</ref> with two parents and two siblings \u2013 one brother<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\">{{cite news |last1=Solomon |first1=Jon |title=Munly talks Slim Cessna's Auto Club's new album and seeing Billy Bragg for the first time |url=https://www.westword.com/music/munly-talks-slim-cessnas-auto-clubs-new-album-and-seeing-billy-bragg-for-the-first-time-5719289 |accessdate=March 23, 2020 |work=Westword |date=December 27, 2012 |ref=Munly Acting Westword}}</ref> and one sister.<ref name=\"Munly ORH\">{{cite news |title=Munly Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots |url=https://archive.org/details/OutsightRadioHoursInterviews2000-2010/KramerEddie.rm |accessdate=April 5, 2020 |work=Outsight Radio Hours |issue=Interview No. 252 |publisher=Archive.org |date=October 26, 2004 |ref=Munly ORH}}</ref><ref name=\"Coolstreams\">{{cite web |title=CoolStreams Internet Radio \u2013 Jay Munly |url=http://musicsojourn.com/AR/Alt/page/m/MunlyJay.htm |website=musicsojourn.com |accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nHe was a well-behaved child growing up, rarely getting into trouble.

In a 2009 interview, he said that he identifies with being an American from Denver more than being a Canadian from Quebec.<ref name=\"Crawdaddy\" />\n\n===Interest in ice hockey===\n\nTaking interest in [[ice hockey]] as a young man in Canada, Munly grew up a [[Montreal Canadiens]] fan.\n\nHe played hockey as a child in Canada and the U.S. before a related injury side-lined him. In a 2012 interview with [[Westword]], he says that his brother took him to the [[Bob Johnson (ice hockey, born 1931)|Bob Johnson]] ice hockey school to play.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\n===Interest in music===\n\nHis interest in music initially stemmed from boredom as he was recovering from an ice hockey injury. He also had some familial ties: his father and grandfather owned and played banjos. His father also made a [[dulcimer]] for his mother as a gift, although she did not play it.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nWhile recuperating from said injury, Munly taught himself how to play his father's 19th century-era [[banjo]], which was technically off-limits to handle.<ref name=\"Munly on Vera\" /> He would eventually teach himself to play the guitar as well.\n\n==Musical process==\n\n===Approach to songwriting===\n\nMunly is the chief songwriter for both his solo endeavors and side projects. It is a role that he is happy to take on by himself, believing that a band's success is dependent on playing to individual strengths rather than collaboration with members on each part of an album's creation.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" />\n\nHe says that he is \"selfish\" with his written material and serious about lyrical preservation.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\nHe expanded on his way of thinking in a 2019 interview with Sadwave, a Russian publication:\n\n{{quote|''\"From the very beginning, I understand where and why I'm writing a song. There is no complicated science. When you have been doing this for so many years, you bring the skill to automatism. I can start with a melody, but I can with a text \u2013 I always have a lot of words, I write a lot. I constantly find common themes in my songs, but I never had the feeling that I was working on a pattern. It would be immoral and unnatural, and I would not want to. I have characters who constantly come back, wander from song to song. But I try to change the angle, write on behalf of different people. On behalf of all sad people.\"''<ref name=\"Munly Sadwave\">{{cite news |last1=Kurkin |first1=Dmitry |title=Jay Manley [sic] (DBUK): 'I try to write on behalf of all sad people' |url=https://sadwave.com/2019/02/jay-munli/ |accessdate=April 5, 2020 |work=sad wave |date=February 8, 2019 |ref=Munly Sadwave}}</ref>}}\n\n===Musical themes and genres===\n\nHis music has ties to [[alt-country]] and [[Gothabilly|Gothic-Americana]]. Common themes include religion, violence and dysfunctional relationships; often they are intertwined. His increasingly narrative songs often feature banjo and, since the recording of his fourth album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', strings.\n\nOne topic that Munly deliberately does not write about is politics, since he \"hates\" music that veers into that kind of territory.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he admits that the stories and songs that he writes can be applied to real-world events in a way that coincidentally fits.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" />\n\n===Controversy===\n\nAs stated in a few interviews, people have found some of Munly's material controversial and politically incorrect. It is important to note that in most cases, the words and phrases used (as well as the views they represent) are that of the fictional characters that Munly creates, not of Munly himself.\n\nExamples:\n\n* ''\"Boys with tattoos can't be Jews\"'' \u2013 from \"Kidneys Running Dry\" on ''Blurry'' (1996)<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /><ref name=\"KRD Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Munly \u2013 Kidneys Running Dry |url=https://genius.com/Munly-kidneys-running-dry-lyrics?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=bd3ae05fe6c1e2a47c4f0713ffa5a16e71fce6fd-1586308658-0-AacccNM6Up3QUKAwcxWr7moI6buvh28pOpYPxYODrvwTY_F1arxPxbTRgSuWyl4Xdp0ySY_ZseZwWCStv8dumtz5AhmL5llOOnD9_3dv6-XTquwykYgduqCixdMk01PstYrSa8KQZi4SK3emYdNuLlbX4RFCHJbwQ1YRExOJjd6dkKD1_GHgcdfYYDe-vTJWI1uyX_0R8Q64ZevT3n-7A-7f2-ifsSZoF6J2JCq_RT2aMwKoWBxbHjarJrGdvNiZWwohYzH2ba2tN14wf2PwTXEzsdbFCgp-hDaOKuoeEYASB7ZBgYOJT_5LMn8GQ2PkKSfxVXNgggJO-I6ajZK3bMX27bSVAiYaqRheMbR_klyaHJvQPTQvRxAPyOR5CZ1c9A |website=Genius |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=KRD Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[a] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"My Darling Sambo\" \u2013 the first track title on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"JCS Amazon\">{{cite web |title=MUNLY, JAY \u2013 Jimmy Carter Syndrome |url=https://www.amazon.com/Jimmy-Carter-Syndrome-JAY-MUNLY/dp/B000BKWZOI |website=Amazon Music |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=JCS Amazon}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[b] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Paint your blackface/Yeah, won't you put me in your anteroom case/I'll be your n***er/On stage\"'' \u2013 from \"Censer from the Footlights\" on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"CFTF Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Jay Munly \u2013 Censer from the Footlights Lyrics |url=http://www.songlyrics.com/jay-munly/censer-from-the-footlights-lyrics/ |website=SongLyrics |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=CFTF Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[c] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[d] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[e] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[f] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Then we found ourselves a half-breed/To tell us our fortune today/He painted my hands a deep, dark red/Said 'now boy, you know that you gotta pay'\"'' \u2013 from \"Goose Walking Over My Grave\" on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"Munly Birds\">{{cite news |last1=Bradley |first1=Lisa M. |title=A Crack in Its Speak: Fantastic Birds in the Gothic Country Lyrics of Jay Munly |url=http://stonetelling.com/issue8-aug2012/bradley-speak.html |accessdate=April 6, 2020 |work=Stone Telling |issue=Issue No. 8 |date=August 2012 |ref=Munly Birds}}</ref><ref name=\"Goose Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Lyrics \u2013 Goose Walking Over My Grave |url=https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Munly-The-Lee-Lewis-Harlots/Goose-Walking-Over-My-Grave |website=Musixmatch |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=Goose Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[g] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"Cassius Castrato The She-Male of the Men's Prison\" \u2013 the fifth track title on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"LLH Album\">{{cite web |title=Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots |url=https://slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com/collections/munly/products/munly-the-lee-lewis-harlots |website=slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=LLH Album}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[h] ]]</sup>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Solo career===\n\nIn the 1990s, Munly started out his music career as a solo artist.

He also shared a 7-inch vinyl album with [[Roger Manning]].<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" />\n\nHe released his debut solo album, ''Blurry'', in 1996 through Top Notch, an imprint of [[What Are Records?]]. ''Munly de Dar He'' and ''Galvanized Yankee'' were also released through Top Notch in 1997 and 1999, respectively. His fourth and final solo album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', was released through [[Alternative Tentacles]] in 2002. Each of these albums were re-mastered by Bob Ferbrache and re-released as limited editions through Smooch Records in 2006. Only 1,000 copies of each were printed.\n\nHe has worked with several musicians that are featured on his albums, such as John Ellison of The Reejers and Chris Mars of The Replacements.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he makes a point of not listing the exact musical contributions of each member in liner notes, preferring the simplicity of the 'Modern Library book' aesthetic.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nAlthough Munly is the primary vocalist and lyricist on each of his albums, he hesitates to call himself a \"singer-songwriter\":\n\n''{{quote|\"It's kind of rough being a solo artist.

It is a severe, disabling disorder with no current cure or treatment. It is the only known medical condition where one [[organ system]] changes into another.\n\nFibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva is caused by a [[mutation]] of the gene [[ACVR1]]. The mutation affects the body's repair mechanism, causing fibrous tissue including [[muscle]], [[tendon]]s, and [[ligament]]s to be [[ossification|ossified]], either spontaneously or when damaged as the result of trauma. In many cases, otherwise minor injuries can cause [[joint]]s to become permanently fused as new bone forms and replaces the damaged muscle tissue. This new bone formation (known as \"heterotopic ossification\") eventually forms a secondary skeleton and progressively restricts the patient's ability to move. Bone formed as a result of this process is identical to \"normal\" bone. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the disease can cause joint degradation separate from its characteristic bone growth.<ref>[https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2019/02/what-happens-when-tissue-turns-to-bone-carol-orzel-mutter-museum/ \"Here's What Happens When Your Body Tissues Turn to Bone\"], ''National Geographic'', 1 March 2019</ref>\n\nSurgical removal of the extra bone growth has been shown to cause the body to \"repair\" the affected area with additional bone. Although the rate of bone growth may differ depending on the patient, the condition ultimately leaves those affected immobilized as new bone replaces musculature and fuses with the skeleton. \n\nSome patients have attempted to position their bodies in a position they would prefer to be positioned in during a flare-up to improve their quality of life.\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nFor unknown reasons, children born with FOP often have malformed [[Hallux|big toes]], sometimes missing a joint or, in other cases, simply presenting with a notable lump at the minor joint. The first \"flare-up\" that leads to the formation of FOP bone usually occurs before the age of 10. The bone growth generally progresses from the top of the body downward, just as bones grow in fetuses. A child with FOP will typically develop additional bones starting at the neck, then at the shoulders, arms, chest area, and finally at the feet.\n\nSpecifically, ossification is typically first seen in the dorsal, axial, cranial and proximal regions of the body. Later the disease progresses in the ventral, appendicular, caudal and distal regions of the body.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. Frederick S. Kaplan, MD, Martine Le Merrer, MD, PhD, Professor of Genetics, David L. Glaser, MD, Robert J. Pignolo, MD, PhD, Robert Goldsby, MD, Joseph A. Kitterman, MD, Jay Groppe, PhD, and Eileen M. Shore, PhD</ref> However, it does not necessarily occur in this order due to injury-caused flare-ups. Often, the tumor-like lumps that characterize a flare--up of the disease appear suddenly. \n\nBone growth occurring during flare-ups may result in the loss of mobility to affected joints, including, if the jaw/mandible is involved, the inability to fully open the mouth, limiting speech and eating.

It is a severe, disabling disorder with no current cure or treatment. It is the only known medical condition where one [[organ system]] changes into another.\n\nFibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva is caused by a [[mutation]] of the gene [[ACVR1]]. The mutation affects the body's repair mechanism, causing fibrous tissue including [[muscle]], [[tendon]]s, and [[ligament]]s to be [[ossification|ossified]], either spontaneously or when damaged as the result of trauma. In many cases, otherwise minor injuries can cause [[joint]]s to become permanently fused as new bone forms and replaces the damaged muscle tissue. This new bone formation (known as \"heterotopic ossification\") eventually forms a secondary skeleton and progressively restricts the patient's ability to move. Bone formed as a result of this process is identical to \"normal\" bone. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the disease can cause joint degradation separate from its characteristic bone growth.<ref>[https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2019/02/what-happens-when-tissue-turns-to-bone-carol-orzel-mutter-museum/ \"Here's What Happens When Your Body Tissues Turn to Bone\"], ''National Geographic'', 1 March 2019</ref>\n\nSurgical removal of the extra bone growth has been shown to cause the body to \"repair\" the affected area with additional bone. Although the rate of bone growth may differ depending on the patient, the condition ultimately leaves those affected immobilized as new bone replaces musculature and fuses with the skeleton. \n\nSome patients have attempted to position their bodies in a position they would prefer to be positioned in during a flare-up to improve their quality of life.\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nFor unknown reasons, children born with FOP often have malformed [[Hallux|big toes]], sometimes missing a joint or, in other cases, simply presenting with a notable lump at the minor joint. The first \"flare-up\" that leads to the formation of FOP bone usually occurs before the age of 10. The bone growth generally progresses from the top of the body downward, just as bones grow in fetuses. A child with FOP will typically develop additional bones starting at the neck, then at the shoulders, arms, chest area, and finally at the feet.\n\nSpecifically, ossification is typically first seen in the dorsal, axial, cranial and proximal regions of the body. Later the disease progresses in the ventral, appendicular, caudal and distal regions of the body.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. Frederick S. Kaplan, MD, Martine Le Merrer, MD, PhD, Professor of Genetics, David L. Glaser, MD, Robert J. Pignolo, MD, PhD, Robert Goldsby, MD, Joseph A. Kitterman, MD, Jay Groppe, PhD, and Eileen M. Shore, PhD</ref> However, it does not necessarily occur in this order due to injury-caused flare-ups. Often, the tumor-like lumps that characterize a flare--up of the disease appear suddenly. \n\nBone growth occurring during flare-ups may result in the loss of mobility to affected joints, including, if the jaw/mandible is involved, the inability to fully open the mouth, limiting speech and eating. A specific occurrence of a flare-up of this condition in the foot/ankle joints can result in the limited ability to put a foot flat on the ground. Bone growth can also result in the immobilization of the hip or knee, affecting the individual's ability to walk. Extra bone formation around the rib cage restricts the expansion of lungs and diaphragm causing respiratory complications.\n\nSince the disorder is so rare, the condition may be misdiagnosed as [[cancer]] or [[fibrosis]].

It is believed the resentment of competing interests led to the creation of the acerbic idea of a clique gaining headway through its closeness to power and thereby approximating resources of the state under the banner of [[capitalism]].\n\n==Usage of the term ''Mafia''==\nThe term Kaduna Mafia was supposedly popularised by journalist, Mvendaga Jibo.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Context===\n\nThe challenges to [[Ahmadu Bello]] of the transition from colonial rule to self-government laid in his role as a member of the traditional ruling establishment. He was confronted with either maintaining the caliphal structures under British rule or modernise administrative structures of the traditional institutions to provide them with power of utility. It is argued that the introduction of reforms of the institutions saved them from withering away. Traditional authority has continued to play a central role in Northern society since the time of Ahmadu Bello, despite continuing reforms.\n\nThe creation of the civil service during the period of Ahmadu Bello is one of his major achievements. He regarded the northern civil service as a meritocracy, which should be above petty political quarrels, and certainly above corruption. The civil service had a rigorous code of ethics, and came to serve as a counterbalance to both politicians and traditional leaders. The trans-ethnic nature of the civil service provided the backbone for Northern Regionalism and for northern development efforts, which were based on the principle of equal distribution of opportunities. The technical and administrative skills of the civil service were essential to a large-scale political community, and the willingness to take assignments outside of the capital city was part of the ethos. The civil service provided a smooth transition from colonial rule to Independence, and an equally smooth transition from Northern Regionalism to the creation of states and the consolidation of Nigerian federalism. Perhaps the key to the effective functioning of the civil service was its apparent balance in terms of sub-regional zones, its transcendence of sub-regional interests, and its ability to incorporate intergenerational cohorts into a cohesive whole. His insistence that the next generation of traditional leaders be western educated set the stage for the transition to their subsequent roles.\n\nThe first generation of northern civil servants (i.e. those born in the decade from about 1910\u20131920 -  [[Abubakar Tafawa Balewa|Tafawa Balewa]], [[Alhaji Yahaya Madawaki|Yahya Madawaki]], [[Isa Kaita]], [[Abubakar Imam]]) tended to be cohorts from Katsina College, and had good personal relationships with their colleagues (including Ahmadu Bello) who had gone into political life.\u00a0\n\nThe second generation of northern civil servants (i.e. those born from 1920\u20131930, and reaching senior status in the service during the transition to independence such as \u2013 [[Mohammed Bello (jurist)|Mohammed Bello]], [[Muhammadu Dikko Yusufu]], [[Hassan Katsina]]) were also part of the [[Barewa College|Katsina-Kaduna-Zaria]] educational connection, and had close working relations with their \u201cseniors,\u201d in the civil service and in the political realm.\u00a0\n\nThe third generation of northern civil servants (i.e. those born in the 1930s and entering the senior service after independence) tended to have overseas educational experience, and there was often a sharp difference in perspective from those in the first and second generations. This generation of Northerners went on to form the core of the Kaduna Mafia.\n\n===Origins===\nThe origins of the Kaduna mafia revolves around the [[1966 Nigerian coup d'\u00e9tat|fall of the First Republic]]. The assassination of Ahmadu Bello and other northern leaders prodded a group of young northerners to rally around and oppose the military government of General [[Aguiyi Ironsi]]. This group, a diverse mixture of aristocrats and civil servants who were predominantly [[Muslim]] and based in Kaduna.

It is believed the resentment of competing interests led to the creation of the acerbic idea of a clique gaining headway through its closeness to power and thereby approximating resources of the state under the banner of [[capitalism]].\n\n==Usage of the term ''Mafia''==\nThe term Kaduna Mafia was supposedly popularised by journalist, Mvendaga Jibo.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Context===\n\nThe challenges to [[Ahmadu Bello]] of the transition from colonial rule to self-government laid in his role as a member of the traditional ruling establishment. He was confronted with either maintaining the caliphal structures under British rule or modernise administrative structures of the traditional institutions to provide them with power of utility. It is argued that the introduction of reforms of the institutions saved them from withering away. Traditional authority has continued to play a central role in Northern society since the time of Ahmadu Bello, despite continuing reforms. \n\nThe creation of the civil service during the period of Ahmadu Bello is one of his major achievements. He regarded the northern civil service as a meritocracy, which should be above petty political quarrels, and certainly above corruption. The civil service had a rigorous code of ethics, and came to serve as a counterbalance to both politicians and traditional leaders. The trans-ethnic nature of the civil service provided the backbone for Northern Regionalism and for northern development efforts, which were based on the principle of equal distribution of opportunities. The technical and administrative skills of the civil service were essential to a large-scale political community, and the willingness to take assignments outside of the capital city was part of the ethos. The civil service provided a smooth transition from colonial rule to Independence, and an equally smooth transition from Northern Regionalism to the creation of states and the consolidation of Nigerian federalism. Perhaps the key to the effective functioning of the civil service was its apparent balance in terms of sub-regional zones, its transcendence of sub-regional interests, and its ability to incorporate intergenerational cohorts into a cohesive whole. His insistence that the next generation of traditional leaders be western educated set the stage for the transition to their subsequent roles.\n\nThe first generation of northern civil servants (i.e. those born in the decade from about 1910\u20131920 -  [[Abubakar Tafawa Balewa|Tafawa Balewa]], [[Alhaji Yahaya Madawaki|Yahya Madawaki]], [[Isa Kaita]], [[Abubakar Imam]]) tended to be cohorts from Katsina College, and had good personal relationships with their colleagues (including Ahmadu Bello) who had gone into political life.\u00a0 \n\nThe second generation of northern civil servants (i.e. those born from 1920\u20131930, and reaching senior status in the service during the transition to independence such as \u2013 [[Mohammed Bello (jurist)|Mohammed Bello]], [[Muhammadu Dikko Yusufu]], [[Hassan Katsina]]) were also part of the [[Barewa College|Katsina-Kaduna-Zaria]] educational connection, and had close working relations with their \u201cseniors,\u201d in the civil service and in the political realm.\u00a0\n\nThe third generation of northern civil servants (i.e. those born in the 1930s and entering the senior service after independence) tended to have overseas educational experience, and there was often a sharp difference in perspective from those in the first and second generations. This generation of Northerners went on to form the core of the Kaduna Mafia.\n\n===Origins===\nThe origins of the Kaduna mafia revolves around the [[1966 Nigerian coup d'\u00e9tat|fall of the First Republic]]. The assasination of Ahmadu Bello and other northern leaders prodded a group of young northerners to rally around and oppose the military government of General [[Aguiyi Ironsi]]. This group, a diverse mixture of aristocrats and civil servants who were predominantly [[Muslim]] and based in Kaduna. It is important to not that a dichotomy exists between the traditional ruling establishment and the mafia, despite an interconnection.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailytrust.com.ng/from-kaduna-mafia-to-caliphate.html|title=From Kaduna Mafia to Caliphate|last=Jega|first=Mahmud|date=2016-10-22|website=Daily Trust|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\nThis group was educated mostly in the United Kingdom, and had connections with the [[Ahmadu Bello University]] in [[Zaria]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamji.com/haruna/haruna304.htm|title=Ibrahim Tahir: An Appreciation by Mamman Daura|last=Daura|first=Mamman|date=|website=Gamji|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> They were known for their intelligence, commitment to the traditional values and socio-political interests of Northern Nigeria and their internal camaraderie.
