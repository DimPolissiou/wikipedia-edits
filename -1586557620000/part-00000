A workhorse of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and (subsequently) Russian airlines for several decades, it carried half of all passengers flown by [[Aeroflot]] and its subsidiaries (137.5 million/year or 243.8 billion passenger km in 1990), remaining the standard domestic-route airliner of Russia and former Soviet states until the mid-2000s.

Capable of operating from unpaved and gravel [[airfields]] with only basic facilities, it was widely used in the extreme [[Arctic]] conditions of Russia's northern/eastern regions where other airliners were unable to operate. Originally designed for a 45,000-hour service life (18,000 cycles) but capable of 80,000 hours with upgrades, it was expected to continue in service until 2016, although [[noise regulation]]s have restricted flights to western Europe and other regions.\n\nIn January 2010 Russian [[flag carrier]] [[Aeroflot]] announced the retirement of its Tu-154 fleet after 40 years, with the last scheduled flight being Aeroflot Flight 736 from [[Yekaterinburg]] to [[Moscow]] on 31 December 2009.<ref>\n{{Cite news | title = Aeroflot retires the legendary TU-154s | publisher = Flight Global | date = 18 January 2010 | url = http://www.flightglobal.com/airspace/forums/aeroflot-retires-the-legendary-tu-154s-44616.aspx|access-date=17 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127091100/http://www.flightglobal.com/airspace/forums/aeroflot-retires-the-legendary-tu-154s-44616.aspx|archive-date=27 January 2010|url-status=live}}\n</ref>\n\nSince 1968 there have been 39 fatal incidents involving the Tu-154, most of which were caused either by factors unrelated to the aircraft, incorrect maintenance, or by its extensive use in demanding conditions.

One of several airframes built in the 1990s and left unsold]]\nThe Tu-154 was developed to meet Aeroflot's requirement to replace the [[turbojet|jet]]-powered [[Tupolev Tu-104|Tu-104]] and the [[Antonov An-10]] and [[Ilyushin Il-18]] [[turboprop]]s. The requirements called for either a payload capacity of {{convert|16|-|18|t|lb}} with a [[Range (aircraft)|range]] of {{Convert|2850|\u2013|4000|km|mi}} while cruising at {{convert|900|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, or a payload of {{convert|5.8|t|lb}} with a range of {{Convert|5800|-|7000|km|mi}} while cruising at {{convert|850|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. A takeoff distance of {{Convert|2600|m|ft}} at [[maximum takeoff weight]] was also stipulated as a requirement. Conceptually similar to the British [[Hawker Siddeley Trident]], which first flew in 1962, and the American [[Boeing 727]], which first flew in 1963, the medium-range Tu-154 was marketed by Tupolev at the same time as Ilyushin was marketing the long-range [[Ilyushin Il-62]]. The Soviet Ministry of Aircraft Industry chose the Tu-154 as it incorporated the latest in Soviet aircraft design and best met Aeroflot's anticipated requirements for the 1970s and 1980s.<ref>Komissarov, p. 8</ref>\n\nThe first project chief was [[Sergey M. Yeger|Sergey Yeger]]; in 1964, Dmitryi S. Markov assumed that position. In 1975, the project lead role was turned over to Aleksandr S. Shengardt.<ref>Komissarov, pp. 5, 18</ref>\n\nThe Tu-154 [[Maiden flight|first flew]] on 4 October 1968. The first deliveries to Aeroflot were in 1970 with freight (mail) services beginning in May 1971 and passenger services in February 1972. There was still limited production of the 154M model as of January 2009 despite previous announcements of the end of production in 2006.<ref>{{Cite web| url = https://www.flightglobal.com/news/| archive-url = https://archive.today/20110521105252/http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2006/06/30/207536/aviakor-ends-tupolev-tu-154m-production-after-fulfilling-last.html| url-status = dead| title = News Channel &#124; Homepage| website = Flightglobal.com| archive-date = 21 May 2011| access-date = 22 October 2019}}</ref> 1025 Tu-154s have been built, 214 of which were still in service as of 14 December 2009.<ref name=\"built\">{{cite web | url = http://www.aerotransport.org/ | title = AeroTransport Data Bank|access-date=26 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021121105512/http://www.aerotransport.org/|archive-date=21 November 2002|url-status=live}}</ref> The last serial Tu-154 was delivered to the [[Russian Defense Ministry]] on 19 February 2013<ref>\n{{Cite news | title = The Last Serial Tu-154 Was Delivered to the Representatives of Russian Defense Ministry | publisher = Vzglyad.Ru | date = 19 February 2013 | url = http://vz.ru/news/2013/2/19/621062.html|access-date=19 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222022206/http://vz.ru/news/2013/2/19/621062.html|archive-date=22 February 2013|url-status=live}}\n</ref> from the Aviakor factory, equipped with upgraded avionics, a VIP interior and a communications suite.

Both the 727 and the Tu-154 use an [[S-duct]] for the middle (Number 2) engine. The original model was equipped with [[Kuznetsov Design Bureau|Kuznetsov]] [[Kuznetsov NK-8|NK-8-2]] engines, which were replaced with [[Soloviev Design Bureau|Soloviev]] [[Soloviev D-30|D-30KU-154]] in the Tu-154M. All Tu-154 aircraft models have a relatively high [[Thrust-to-weight ratio|thrust-to-weight-ratio]] which give excellent performance, at the expense of lower [[fuel efficiency]]. This became an important factor in later decades as fuel costs grew.{{citation needed|date = April 2014}}\n\nThe [[cockpit]] is fitted with conventional dual [[Yoke (aircraft)|yoke control columns]]. Flight control surfaces are hydraulically operated.\n\nThe cabin of the Tu-154, although of the same six-abreast seating layout, gives the impression of an oval interior, with a lower ceiling than is common on [[Boeing]] and [[Airbus]] airliners. The passenger cabin accommodates 128 passengers in a two-class layout and 164 passengers in single-class layout, and up to 180 passengers in high-density layout. The layout can be modified to what is called a winter version where some seats are taken out and a wardrobe is installed for passenger coats. The passenger doors are smaller than on its Boeing and Airbus counterparts. Luggage space in the overhead compartments is very limited.\n\nLike the [[Tupolev Tu-134]], the Tu-154 has a wing [[swept wing|swept back]] at 35\u00b0 at the quarter-[[Chord (aircraft)|chord]] line. The British [[Hawker Siddeley Trident]] has the same sweepback angle, while the Boeing 727 has a slightly smaller sweepback angle of 32\u00b0. The wing also has [[Dihedral (aircraft)#Anhedral|anhedral]] (downward sweep) which is a distinguishing feature of Russian low-wing airliners designed during this era. Most Western low-wing airliners such as the contemporary Boeing 727 have [[Dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]] (upward sweep). The anhedral means that Russian airliners have poor lateral stability compared to their Western counterparts, but also are more resistant to [[Dutch roll]] tendencies.\n\nConsiderably heavier than its predecessor Soviet-built airliner the [[Ilyushin Il-18]], the Tu-154 was equipped with an oversized [[landing gear]] to reduce ground load, enabling it to operate from the same runways. The aircraft has two six-wheel main [[Bogie#Bogie (aircraft)|bogies]] fitted with large low-pressure tires that retract into pods extending from the [[trailing edge]]s of the wings (a common Tupolev feature), plus a two-wheel nosegear unit. Soft oleo struts ([[shock absorbers]]) provide a much smoother ride on bumpy airfields than most airliners, which very rarely operate on such poor surfaces.\n\nThe original requirement was to have a three-person [[Aircrew|flight crew]] \u2013 [[Captain (land)|captain]], [[First Officer (civil aviation)|first officer]] and [[flight engineer]] \u2013 as opposed to a four- or five-person crew, as on other Soviet airliners. It became evident that a fourth crew member, a [[navigator]], was still needed, and a seat was added on production aircraft, although their workstation was compromised due to the limitations of the original design. Navigators are no longer trained and this profession is becoming obsolete with the retirement of the oldest Soviet-era planes. \n\nThe latest variant (Tu-154M-100, introduced 1998) includes an NVU-B3 [[Doppler radar|Doppler]] navigation system, a triple [[autopilot]], which provides an automatic ILS approach according to [[ICAO]] category II weather minima, an [[autothrottle]], a Doppler drift and speed measure system (DISS), and a \"Kurs-MP\" radio navigation suite.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} A stability and control augmentation system improves handling characteristics during manual flight. Modern upgrades normally include modernised [[TCAS]], [[GPS]], and other systems (mostly American-made or EU-made). \n\nEarly versions of the Tu-154 cannot be modified to meet the current Stage III [[noise regulation]]s and are no longer allowed to fly into airspace where such regulations are enforced, such as the European Union. However, the Tu-154M's D-30 engines can be fitted with hush kits, allowing them to meet noise regulations.\n\n==Variants==<!-- This section is linked from [[Ariana Afghan Airlines]] -->\n[[File:RIAN archive 498003 TU154 serial passenger aircraft (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Aeroflot]] Tu-154 over the [[Volga River]]]]\n[[File:Tupolev Tu-154B-1, Tarom AN0193531.jpg|thumb|[[TAROM]] Tu-154B-1]]\n[[File:Chernomor-Avia Tupolev Tu-154B-2 Pashnin.jpg|thumb|[[Chernomor-Avia]] Tu-154B-2]]\n[[File:Cubana Tupolev Tu-154B-2 Regis.jpg|thumb|Tu-154B-2 of [[Cubana]]]]\n[[File:Tupolev Tu-154M, Uzbekistan Airways JP6144356.jpg|thumb|[[Uzbekistan Airways]] Tu-154M]]\n[[File:Tupolev Tu-154M, Iran Air Tours JP6511800.jpg|thumb|[[Iran Air Tours]] Tu-154M]]\nMany variants of this airliner have been built. Like its western counterpart, the [[Boeing 727|727]], many of the Tu-154s in service have been hush-kitted, and some converted to freighters.\n\n; Tu-154\n: Tu-154 production started in 1970, and the first passenger flight was performed on 9 February 1972. Powered by [[Kuznetsov Design Bureau|Kuznetsov]] NK-8-2 turbofans, it carried 164 passengers. About 42 were built.\n\n; Tu-154A\n: The first upgraded version of the original Tu-154, the A model, in production since 1974, added center-section fuel tanks and more emergency exits, while engines were upgraded to higher-thrust Kuznetsov NK-8-2U. Other upgrades include automatic flaps/slats and stabilizer controls and modified avionics. Max. takeoff weight \u2013 94,000&nbsp;kg (207,235 lb). There were 15 different interior layouts for the different domestic and international customers, seating between 144 and 152 passengers. To discern the A model from the base model note the spike at the junction of the fin and tail. This is a fat bullet on the A model, and a slender spike on the base model.<ref>Komissarov, p. 21</ref>\n\n; Tu-154B\n: As the original Tu-154 and Tu-154A suffered wing cracks after a few years in service, a version with a new, stronger wing, designated Tu-154B, went into production in 1975. It also had an additional fuselage fuel tank, additional emergency exits in the tail. Also, the maximum takeoff weight increased to 98,000&nbsp;kg (216,053 lb). Important to Aeroflot was the increased passenger capacity, hence lower operating costs. With the NK-8-2U engines the only way to improve the economics of the airplane was to spread costs across more seats.<ref>OKB Tupolev, A History of the Design Bureau and its Aircraft, Yefin Gordon and Vladimir Rigmant, translated by Alexander Boyd, edited by Dmitriy Komissarov (Hinckley, UK, 2005) {{ISBN|1-85780-214-4}} p. 257.</ref> The [[autopilot]] was certified for ICAO Category II automatic approaches. Most previously built Tu-154 and Tu-154A were also modified into this variant, with the replacement of the wing. Maximum takeoff weight increased to 96,000&nbsp;kg (211,644 lb). 111 were built.\n\n; Tu-154B-1\n: Aeroflot wanted this version for increased revenue on domestic routes. It carried 160 passengers. This version also had some minor modifications to the fuel system, avionics, air conditioning, and landing gear. 64 were built from 1977 to 1978.\n\n; Tu-154B-2\n: A minor modernization of Tu-154B-1. The airplane was designed to be converted from the 160 passenger version to a 180 passenger version by removing the galley.<ref>Komissarov, p. 27</ref> The procedure took about 2 1/2 hours. Some of the earlier Tu-154Bs were modified to that standard. Maximum takeoff weight increased to 98,000&nbsp;kg (216,053 lb), later to 100,000&nbsp;kg (220,462 lb). Some 311 aircraft were built, including VIP versions. A few remain in service.\n\n; Tu-154S\n: The Tu-154S is an all-cargo or freighter version of the Tu-154B, using a strengthened floor, and adding a forward cargo door on the port side of the fuselage. The aircraft could carry nine Soviet PAV-3 pallets. Maximum payload \u2013 20,000&nbsp;kg (44,092 lb). There were plans for 20 aircraft, but only nine were converted, two from Tu-154 models and seven from Tu-154B models. Trials were held in the early 1980s and the aircraft was authorized regular operations in 1984. By 1997 all had been retired.<ref>Komissarov, pp. 29\u201331</ref>\n\n; Tu-154M\n: The Tu-154M and Tu-154M Lux are the most highly upgraded versions, which first flew in 1982 and entered mass production in 1984. It uses more fuel-efficient [[Soloviev D-30]]KU-154 turbofans. Together with significant aerodynamic refinement, this led to much lower fuel consumption hence longer range, as well as lower operating costs. The aircraft has new double-slotted (instead of triple-slotted) flaps, with an extra 36-degree position (in addition to existing 15, 28 and 45-degree positions on older versions), which allows reduction of noise on approach. It also has a relocated [[auxiliary power unit]] and numerous other improvements. Maximum takeoff weight increased first to 100,000&nbsp;kg (220,462 lb), then to 102,000&nbsp;kg (224,872 lb). Some aircraft are certified to 104,000&nbsp;kg (229,281 lb). About 320 were manufactured. Mass production ended in 2006, though limited manufacturing continued as of January 2009. No new airframes have been built since the early 1990s, and production since then involved assembling aircraft from components on hand.<ref>Komissarov, p. 34</ref> Chinese '''Tu-154MD''' electronic intelligence aircraft carry a large-size synthetic aperture radar (SAR) under their mainframe.<ref name=\"AirForceWorld.com_tu154md_electronic_intelligence_aircraft\">{{cite web | url = http://www.airforceworld.com/pla/tu154md.htm | title = AirForceWorld.com Tu154md Electronic Intelligence Aircraft | work = AirForceWorld.com |access-date=30 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305060021/http://www.airforceworld.com/pla/tu154md.htm |archive-date=5 March 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n; Tu-154M-LK-1\n: Cosmonaut trainer. This was a salon VIP aircraft modified to train [[cosmonauts]] to fly the [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]] reusable spacecraft, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] equivalent of the US [[Space Shuttle]]. The Tu-154 was used because the Buran required a steep descent, which the Tu-154 was capable of replicating. The cabin featured trainee workstations, one of which was identical to the Buran's flightdeck. The forward baggage compartment was converted into a camera bay, as the aircraft was used to train cosmonauts in observation and photographic techniques.<ref>Komissarov, pp. 36\u201337</ref>\n\n; Tu-154M-ON monitoring aircraft\n: Germany modified one of the Tu-154s it inherited from the former [[East Germany|East German]] Air Force into an observation airplane. This aircraft was involved with the [[Treaty on Open Skies|Open Skies]] inspection flights. It was converted at the [[EADS EFW|Elbe Aircraft Plant (Elbe Flugzeugwerke)]] in [[Dresden]], and flew in 1996. After 24 monitoring missions, it was lost in a mid-air collision in 1997.<ref>Komissarov, pp. 38\u201339</ref>\n\n: The Russians also converted a Tu-154M to serve as an [[Treaty on Open Skies|Open Skies]] monitoring aircraft. They used the Tu-154M-LK-1, and converted it to a Tu-154M-ON. When not flying over North America, it is used to ferry cosmonauts. China is believed {{according to whom|date=December 2016}} to have converted one Tu-154 to an [[electronic countermeasures]] aircraft.<ref>Komissarov, p. 40</ref>\n\n; Tu-154M-100\n: Design of this variant started in 1994, but the first aircraft were not delivered until 1998. It is an upgraded version with Western avionics, including the [[Flight Management Computer]], [[GPS]], [[EGPWS]], [[TCAS]], and other modern systems. The airplane could carry up to 157 passengers. The cabin featured an automatic oxygen system and larger overhead bins. Three were produced, as payment of debts owed by Russia to [[Slovakia]].

Capable of operating from unpaved and gravel [[airfields]] with only basic facilities, it was widely used in the extreme [[Arctic]] conditions of Russia's northern/eastern regions where other airliners were unable to operate. Originally designed for a 45,000-hour service life (18,000 cycles) but capable of 80,000 hours with upgrades, it was expected to continue in service until 2016, although [[noise regulation]]s have restricted flights to western Europe and other regions.\n\nIn January 2010 Russian [[flag carrier]] [[Aeroflot]] announced the retirement of its Tu-154 fleet after 40 years, with the last scheduled flight being Aeroflot Flight 736 from [[Yekaterinburg]] to [[Moscow]] on 31 December 2009.<ref>\n{{Cite news | title = Aeroflot retires the legendary TU-154s | publisher = Flight Global | date = 18 January 2010 | url = http://www.flightglobal.com/airspace/forums/aeroflot-retires-the-legendary-tu-154s-44616.aspx|access-date=17 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127091100/http://www.flightglobal.com/airspace/forums/aeroflot-retires-the-legendary-tu-154s-44616.aspx|archive-date=27 January 2010|url-status=live}}\n</ref>\n\nSince 1968 there have been 39 fatal incidents involving the Tu-154, most of which were caused either by factors unrelated to the aircraft, incorrect maintenance, or by its extensive use in demanding conditions.

One of several airframes built in the 1990s and left unsold]]\nThe Tu-154 was developed to meet Aeroflot's requirement to replace the [[turbojet|jet]]-powered [[Tupolev Tu-104|Tu-104]] and the [[Antonov An-10]] and [[Ilyushin Il-18]] [[turboprop]]s. The requirements called for either a payload capacity of {{convert|16|-|18|t|lb}} with a [[Range (aircraft)|range]] of {{Convert|2850|\u2013|4000|km|mi}} while cruising at {{convert|900|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, or a payload of {{convert|5.8|t|lb}} with a range of {{Convert|5800|-|7000|km|mi}} while cruising at {{convert|850|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. A takeoff distance of {{Convert|2600|m|ft}} at [[maximum takeoff weight]] was also stipulated as a requirement. Conceptually similar to the British [[Hawker Siddeley Trident]], which first flew in 1962, and the American [[Boeing 727]], which first flew in 1963, the medium-range Tu-154 was marketed by Tupolev at the same time as Ilyushin was marketing the long-range [[Ilyushin Il-62]]. The Soviet Ministry of Aircraft Industry chose the Tu-154 as it incorporated the latest in Soviet aircraft design and best met Aeroflot's anticipated requirements for the 1970s and 1980s.<ref>Komissarov, p. 8</ref>\n\nThe first project chief was [[Sergey M. Yeger|Sergey Yeger]]; in 1964, Dmitryi S. Markov assumed that position. In 1975, the project lead role was turned over to Aleksandr S. Shengardt.<ref>Komissarov, pp. 5, 18</ref>\n\nThe Tu-154 [[Maiden flight|first flew]] on 4 October 1968. The first deliveries to Aeroflot were in 1970 with freight (mail) services beginning in May 1971 and passenger services in February 1972.

Both the 727 and the Tu-154 use an [[S-duct]] for the middle (Number 2) engine. The original model was equipped with [[Kuznetsov Design Bureau|Kuznetsov]] [[Kuznetsov NK-8|NK-8-2]] engines, which were replaced with [[Soloviev Design Bureau|Soloviev]] [[Soloviev D-30|D-30KU-154]] in the Tu-154M. All Tu-154 aircraft models have a relatively high [[Thrust-to-weight ratio|thrust-to-weight-ratio]] which give excellent performance, at the expense of lower [[fuel efficiency]]. This became an important factor in later decades as fuel costs grew.{{citation needed|date = April 2014}}\n\nThe [[cockpit]] is fitted with conventional dual [[Yoke (aircraft)|yoke control columns]]. Flight control surfaces are hydraulically operated.\n\nThe cabin of the Tu-154, although of the same six-abreast seating layout, gives the impression of an oval interior, with a lower ceiling than is common on [[Boeing]] and [[Airbus]] airliners. The passenger cabin accommodates 128 passengers in a two-class layout and 164 passengers in single-class layout, and up to 180 passengers in high-density layout. The layout can be modified to what is called a winter version where some seats are taken out and a wardrobe is installed for passenger coats. The passenger doors are smaller than on its Boeing and Airbus counterparts. Luggage space in the overhead compartments is very limited.\n\nLike the [[Tupolev Tu-134]], the Tu-154 has a wing [[swept wing|swept back]] at 35\u00b0 at the quarter-[[Chord (aircraft)|chord]] line. The British [[Hawker Siddeley Trident]] has the same sweepback angle, while the Boeing 727 has a slightly smaller sweepback angle of 32\u00b0. The wing also has [[Dihedral (aircraft)#Anhedral|anhedral]] (downward sweep) which is a distinguishing feature of Russian low-wing airliners designed during this era. Most Western low-wing airliners such as the contemporary Boeing 727 have [[Dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]] (upward sweep). The anhedral means that Russian airliners have poor lateral stability compared to their Western counterparts, but also are more resistant to [[Dutch roll]] tendencies.\n\nConsiderably heavier than its predecessor Soviet-built airliner the [[Ilyushin Il-18]], the Tu-154 was equipped with an oversized [[landing gear]] to reduce ground load, enabling it to operate from the same runways. The aircraft has two six-wheel main [[Bogie#Bogie (aircraft)|bogies]] fitted with large low-pressure tires that retract into pods extending from the [[trailing edge]]s of the wings (a common Tupolev feature), plus a two-wheel nosegear unit. Soft oleo struts ([[shock absorbers]]) provide a much smoother ride on bumpy airfields than most airliners, which very rarely operate on such poor surfaces.\n\nThe original requirement was to have a three-person [[Aircrew|flight crew]] \u2013 [[Captain (land)|captain]], [[First Officer (civil aviation)|first officer]] and [[flight engineer]] \u2013 as opposed to a four- or five-person crew, as on other Soviet airliners. It became evident that a fourth crew member, a [[navigator]], was still needed, and a seat was added on production aircraft, although their workstation was compromised due to the limitations of the original design. Navigators are no longer trained and this profession is becoming obsolete with the retirement of the oldest Soviet-era planes. \n\nThe latest variant (Tu-154M-100, introduced 1998) includes an NVU-B3 [[Doppler radar|Doppler]] navigation system, a triple [[autopilot]], which provides an automatic ILS approach according to [[ICAO]] category II weather minima, an [[autothrottle]], a Doppler drift and speed measure system (DISS), and a \"Kurs-MP\" radio navigation suite.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} A stability and control augmentation system improves handling characteristics during manual flight. Modern upgrades normally include modernised [[TCAS]], [[GPS]], and other systems (mostly American-made or EU-made). \n\nEarly versions of the Tu-154 cannot be modified to meet the current Stage III [[noise regulation]]s and are no longer allowed to fly into airspace where such regulations are enforced, such as the European Union. However, the Tu-154M's D-30 engines can be fitted with hush kits, allowing them to meet noise regulations.\n\n==Variants==<!-- This section is linked from [[Ariana Afghan Airlines]] -->\n[[File:RIAN archive 498003 TU154 serial passenger aircraft (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Aeroflot]] Tu-154 over the [[Volga River]]]]\n[[File:Tupolev Tu-154B-1, Tarom AN0193531.jpg|thumb|[[TAROM]] Tu-154B-1]]\n[[File:Chernomor-Avia Tupolev Tu-154B-2 Pashnin.jpg|thumb|[[Chernomor-Avia]] Tu-154B-2]]\n[[File:Cubana Tupolev Tu-154B-2 Regis.jpg|thumb|Tu-154B-2 of [[Cubana]]]]\n[[File:Tupolev Tu-154M, Uzbekistan Airways JP6144356.jpg|thumb|[[Uzbekistan Airways]] Tu-154M]]\n[[File:Tupolev Tu-154M, Iran Air Tours JP6511800.jpg|thumb|[[Iran Air Tours]] Tu-154M]]\nMany variants of this airliner have been built. Like its western counterpart, the [[Boeing 727|727]], many of the Tu-154s in service have been hush-kitted, and some converted to freighters.\n\n; Tu-154\n: Tu-154 production started in 1970, and the first passenger flight was performed on 9 February 1972. Powered by [[Kuznetsov Design Bureau|Kuznetsov]] NK-8-2 turbofans, it carried 164 passengers. About 42 were built.\n\n; Tu-154A\n: The first upgraded version of the original Tu-154, the A model, in production since 1974, added center-section fuel tanks and more emergency exits, while engines were upgraded to higher-thrust Kuznetsov NK-8-2U. Other upgrades include automatic flaps/slats and stabilizer controls and modified avionics. Max. takeoff weight \u2013 94,000&nbsp;kg (207,235 lb). There were 15 different interior layouts for the different domestic and international customers, seating between 144 and 152 passengers. To discern the A model from the base model note the spike at the junction of the fin and tail. This is a fat bullet on the A model, and a slender spike on the base model.<ref>Komissarov, p. 21</ref>\n\n; Tu-154B\n: As the original Tu-154 and Tu-154A suffered wing cracks after a few years in service, a version with a new, stronger wing, designated Tu-154B, went into production in 1975. It also had an additional fuselage fuel tank, additional emergency exits in the tail. Also, the maximum takeoff weight increased to 98,000&nbsp;kg (216,053 lb). Important to Aeroflot was the increased passenger capacity, hence lower operating costs. With the NK-8-2U engines the only way to improve the economics of the airplane was to spread costs across more seats.<ref>OKB Tupolev, A History of the Design Bureau and its Aircraft, Yefin Gordon and Vladimir Rigmant, translated by Alexander Boyd, edited by Dmitriy Komissarov (Hinckley, UK, 2005) {{ISBN|1-85780-214-4}} p. 257.</ref> The [[autopilot]] was certified for ICAO Category II automatic approaches. Most previously built Tu-154 and Tu-154A were also modified into this variant, with the replacement of the wing. Maximum takeoff weight increased to 96,000&nbsp;kg (211,644 lb). 111 were built.\n\n; Tu-154B-1\n: Aeroflot wanted this version for increased revenue on domestic routes. It carried 160 passengers. This version also had some minor modifications to the fuel system, avionics, air conditioning, and landing gear. 64 were built from 1977 to 1978.\n\n; Tu-154B-2\n: A minor modernization of Tu-154B-1. The airplane was designed to be converted from the 160 passenger version to a 180 passenger version by removing the galley.<ref>Komissarov, p. 27</ref> The procedure took about 2 1/2 hours. Some of the earlier Tu-154Bs were modified to that standard. Maximum takeoff weight increased to 98,000&nbsp;kg (216,053 lb), later to 100,000&nbsp;kg (220,462 lb). Some 311 aircraft were built, including VIP versions. A few remain in service.\n\n; Tu-154S\n: The Tu-154S is an all-cargo or freighter version of the Tu-154B, using a strengthened floor, and adding a forward cargo door on the port side of the fuselage. The aircraft could carry nine Soviet PAV-3 pallets. Maximum payload \u2013 20,000&nbsp;kg (44,092 lb). There were plans for 20 aircraft, but only nine were converted, two from Tu-154 models and seven from Tu-154B models. Trials were held in the early 1980s and the aircraft was authorized regular operations in 1984. By 1997 all had been retired.<ref>Komissarov, pp. 29\u201331</ref>\n\n; Tu-154M\n: The Tu-154M and Tu-154M Lux are the most highly upgraded versions, which first flew in 1982 and entered mass production in 1984. It uses more fuel-efficient [[Soloviev D-30]]KU-154 turbofans. Together with significant aerodynamic refinement, this led to much lower fuel consumption hence longer range, as well as lower operating costs. The aircraft has new double-slotted (instead of triple-slotted) flaps, with an extra 36-degree position (in addition to existing 15, 28 and 45-degree positions on older versions), which allows reduction of noise on approach. It also has a relocated [[auxiliary power unit]] and numerous other improvements. Maximum takeoff weight increased first to 100,000&nbsp;kg (220,462 lb), then to 102,000&nbsp;kg (224,872 lb). Some aircraft are certified to 104,000&nbsp;kg (229,281 lb). About 320 were manufactured. Mass production ended in 2006, though limited manufacturing continued as of January 2009. No new airframes have been built since the early 1990s, and production since then involved assembling aircraft from components on hand.<ref>Komissarov, p. 34</ref> Chinese '''Tu-154MD''' electronic intelligence aircraft carry a large-size synthetic aperture radar (SAR) under their mainframe.<ref name=\"AirForceWorld.com_tu154md_electronic_intelligence_aircraft\">{{cite web | url = http://www.airforceworld.com/pla/tu154md.htm | title = AirForceWorld.com Tu154md Electronic Intelligence Aircraft | work = AirForceWorld.com |access-date=30 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305060021/http://www.airforceworld.com/pla/tu154md.htm |archive-date=5 March 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n; Tu-154M-LK-1\n: Cosmonaut trainer. This was a salon VIP aircraft modified to train [[cosmonauts]] to fly the [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]] reusable spacecraft, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] equivalent of the US [[Space Shuttle]]. The Tu-154 was used because the Buran required a steep descent, which the Tu-154 was capable of replicating. The cabin featured trainee workstations, one of which was identical to the Buran's flightdeck. The forward baggage compartment was converted into a camera bay, as the aircraft was used to train cosmonauts in observation and photographic techniques.<ref>Komissarov, pp. 36\u201337</ref>\n\n; Tu-154M-ON monitoring aircraft\n: Germany modified one of the Tu-154s it inherited from the former [[East Germany|East German]] Air Force into an observation airplane. This aircraft was involved with the [[Treaty on Open Skies|Open Skies]] inspection flights. It was converted at the [[EADS EFW|Elbe Aircraft Plant (Elbe Flugzeugwerke)]] in [[Dresden]], and flew in 1996. After 24 monitoring missions, it was lost in a mid-air collision in 1997.<ref>Komissarov, pp. 38\u201339</ref>\n\n: The Russians also converted a Tu-154M to serve as an [[Treaty on Open Skies|Open Skies]] monitoring aircraft. They used the Tu-154M-LK-1, and converted it to a Tu-154M-ON. When not flying over North America, it is used to ferry cosmonauts. China is believed {{according to whom|date=December 2016}} to have converted one Tu-154 to an [[electronic countermeasures]] aircraft.<ref>Komissarov, p. 40</ref>\n\n; Tu-154M-100\n: Design of this variant started in 1994, but the first aircraft were not delivered until 1998. It is an upgraded version with Western avionics, including the [[Flight Management Computer]], [[GPS]], [[EGPWS]], [[TCAS]], and other modern systems. The airplane could carry up to 157 passengers. The cabin featured an automatic oxygen system and larger overhead bins. Three were produced, as payment of debts owed by Russia to [[Slovakia]]. Three aircraft were delivered in 1998 to [[Slovak Airlines]], and sold back to Russia in 2003.<ref>Komissarov, pp. 36, 144\u2013145</ref>\n; [[Tupolev Tu-155|Tu-155]]\n: A Tu-154 converted into a testbed for alternative fuels.
