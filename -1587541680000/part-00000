Fortunately, populations have since recovered after the elimination of commercial [[Seal hunting|sealing]] in the 1950s.<ref name=iucn />\n\nHowever, the effects of global [[climate change]] on Antarctic seals are still to be fully determined. Research estimates seal populations may decline as the availability of their habitat is extremely temperature sensitive thus making them potentially [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors= Evans, PG, Pierce GJ, Panigada S |year=2010 |title= Climate change and marine mammals|journal=Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom |volume=90 |issue=8 |pages=1483\u20131487  |doi=10.1017/S0025315410001815 |doi-access=free }}</ref>  Climate changes affecting the duration and the extent of the sea ice and nutrients availability could potentially reduce pups\u2019 survival and may have important implications for population [[Growth rate (group theory)|growth rates]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Garrott RA, Rotella JJ, Siniff DB, Parkinson CL, Stauffer GE |year= 2012|title=Environmental variation and cohort effects in an Antarctic predator |journal= Oikos|volume= 121|issue= 7|pages= 1027\u20131040 |doi= 10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.19673.x|hdl= 2060/20110022991|hdl-access= free}}</ref> The fact that some populations breed on land (e.g., at South Georgia), could demonstrate an ability in the species to colonize different environments, although the extent of such [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] is uncertain.<ref name=iucn />\n\nIn the past, the establishment of Antarctic research bases has caused a measure of disturbance to these seals. In January 1998 the Environmental Protection Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty was ratified, implementing environmental measures such as the banning of [[mining]] and [[oil drilling]] in Antarctica for at least 50 years, along with the banning of refuse disposal and the use of [[pesticide]]s in the region.<ref name=iucn /> However, the disturbance effects of the increasing seasonal tourism in the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic on Weddell seal behavior, distribution, and foraging are still unknown.\n\nCurrently there are no reports of significant [[Fishery|fisheries]] interactions. Although, the development of new fisheries in Antarctic waters, particularly one targeting the [[Antarctic toothfish]], could have an impact on Weddell seal nutrition, and potential operational interactions should be considered in the management plans.\n\n==Conservation status== \nThe Weddell seal is protected by the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]] and the [[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals]] (CCAS). It is classified as being of \"[[least concern]]\" by the IUCN.<ref name=iucn /> This species is not listed by [[CITES]].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Leptonychotes weddellii}}\n{{Wikispecies|Leptonychotes weddellii}}\n*[https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/11696/45226713 IUCN Red List]\n*[http://cetus.ucsd.edu/voicesinthesea_org/species/pinnipeds/weddellSeal.html Voices in the Sea - Sounds of the Weddell Seal]\n*[http://weddellsealscience.com/index.html Weddell seal science]\n*[https://www.pinnipeds.org/seal-information/species-information-pages/the-phocid-seals/weddell-seal Information on Weddell seals]\n*[http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/wildlife/animals/seals-and-sea-lions/weddell-seals Australian Antarctic Government]\n*[https://marinebio.org/species/weddell-seals/leptonychotes-weddellii/ Biology of Weddell seals ]\n*[https://www.coolantarctica.com/Antarctica%20fact%20file/wildlife/weddell_seals.php Fun facts about Weddell seals]\n\n{{Crowned and Stemmed Genera of Pinnipeds}}\n{{Carnivora|C1.}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q313166}}\n\n[[Category:Lobodontins]]\n[[Category:Pinnipeds of Antarctica]]\n[[Category:Pinnipeds of South America|Seal, Weddell]]\n[[Category:Pinnipeds of Australia]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Chile]]\n[[Category:Mammals of South Australia]]\n[[Category:Carnivorans of South America|Seal, Weddell]]\n[[Category:Least concern biota of Oceania|Seal, Weddell]]\n[[Category:Least concern biota of South America|Seal, Weddell]]\n[[Category:Mammals described in 1826]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Ren\u00e9 Lesson]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "name_user": "Certes", "label": "safe", "comment": "mitigate sea of blue", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weddell_seal"}
