During the time of the murders, he remained active in his community, regularly performing at events as his own characters, \"Pogo the [[Clown]]\" or \"Patches the Clown\", and so is known as the \"Killer Clown\". His first murder occurred in 1972 and at least 30 of his subsequent murders were committed after the divorce of his second wife in 1976. Investigation into the case of missing [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]] teenager Robert Piest led to Gacy's arrest on December 21, 1978.\n\nGacy was convicted of the [[sodomy]] of a teenage boy in Iowa in 1968. He was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, but was released from prison on good behavior; and returned to his home state of Illinois. It is believed all of his known murders were committed inside his [[Ranch-style house|ranch house]] in [[Norwood Park Township, Cook County, Illinois|Norwood Park]], a part of [[Chicago metropolitan area|metropolitan Chicago]]. Once lured to his home by force or deception, his victims were typically duped into donning [[handcuffs]] on the pretext of being shown a [[Magic (illusion)|magic trick]] and then raped and tortured before being murdered by either [[asphyxiation]] or [[strangulation]] with a makeshift [[garrote]].\n\n26 of Gacy's victims were buried in the [[Crawl space (basement)|crawl space]] of his home. Three other victims were buried elsewhere on his property, while the bodies of his last four known victims were discarded in the [[Des Plaines River]]. The conviction for 33 murders was then the largest number of murders charged to one individual in United States history. Gacy was sentenced to death on March 13, 1980 for 12 of those murders. He spent 14 years on death row at [[Menard Correctional Center]], spending much of his time painting, and was executed by [[lethal injection]] at [[Stateville Correctional Center]] on May 10, 1994.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Wayne Gacy was born in Chicago, [[Illinois]] on March 17, 1942, the second child and only son of John Stanley Gacy (June 20, 1900 \u2013 December 25, 1969) and Marion Elaine Robinson (May 4, 1908 \u2013 December 6, 1989).<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 63.</ref> His father was an auto repair machinist and [[World War I]] veteran,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=24}} and his mother was a homemaker.<ref>Cook County marriage records provide his mother's name as Marion E.

He was close to his two sisters and mother but endured a difficult relationship with his father, an [[alcoholic]] who was [[physical abuse|physically abusive]] to his wife and children.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=256\u2013257}} Gacy seldom received his approval. He later recollected he was \"never good enough\" in his father's eyes.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=31}}  His father regularly belittled him, calling him \"dumb and stupid\" and comparing him unfavorably with his sisters.<ref>''Serial Killers.'' pp. 54\u201355.</ref> Despite this, Gacy always denied ever hating his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=21}} \n\nOne of Gacy's earliest childhood memories was of being beaten with a leather belt at the age of four for accidentally disarranging car engine components his father had assembled.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=18\u201319}} On another occasion, he was struck across the head with a broomstick and rendered [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]].<ref>{{cite book | first1=Jason| last1=Moss| first2=Jeffrey| last2=Kottler| title=The Last Victim: A True-life Journey into the Mind of the Serial Killer| publisher=Grand Central Publishing| location=New York City| date=2000|isbn=0-7535-0398-0| p=103}}</ref> When he was six years old, Gacy stole a toy truck from a neighborhood store. His mother made him walk back to the store, return the toy and apologize to the owners. His mother informed his father, who beat Gacy with a belt as punishment. After this incident, Gacy's mother attempted to shield her son from his father's verbal and physical abuse,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=26}} yet this only succeeded in Gacy earning accusations that he was a \"[[sissy]]\" and a \"Mama's boy\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} who would \"probably grow up [[queer]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=40}}\n\nIn 1949, Gacy's father was informed that his son and another boy had been caught sexually fondling a young girl.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=218}} Gacy's father whipped him with a [[razor strop]] as punishment. The same year,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=17}} Gacy was [[child molestation|molested]] by a family friend,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} a contractor who would take Gacy for rides in his truck and then fondle him. Gacy never told his father about these incidents, afraid that his father would blame him.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\">''Serial Killers''. p. 54.</ref>\n\nBecause of a heart condition, Gacy was ordered to avoid all sports at school.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\" /> During the fourth grade, Gacy began to experience [[Syncope (medicine)|blackout]]s. He was occasionally hospitalized because of these seizures, and also in 1957 for a [[appendicitis|burst appendix]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=18}} Gacy later estimated that between the ages of 14 and 18, he had spent almost a year in the hospital for these episodes, and attributed the decline of his grades to his missing school. His father suspected the episodes were an effort to gain sympathy and attention, and openly accused his son of faking the condition as the boy lay in a hospital bed.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |issn=1364-5803 |page=5}}</ref> Although his mother, sisters, and few close friends never doubted his illness, Gacy's medical condition was never conclusively diagnosed.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=32}}\n\nOne of Gacy's friends at high school recalled several instances in which his father ridiculed or beat his son without provocation. On one occasion in 1957, the same friend witnessed an incident at the Gacy household in which Gacy's father began shouting at his son for no reason, then began hitting him.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=33}} Gacy's mother attempted to intervene. The friend recalled that Gacy simply \"put up his hands to defend himself\", adding that he never struck his father back during these physical altercations.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n===Career origins===\nIn 1960, at the age of 18, Gacy became involved in politics, working as an assistant [[precinct captain]] for a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] candidate in his neighborhood. This decision earned more criticism from his father, who accused his son of being a \"[[wikt:Special:Search/dupe|patsy]]\". Gacy later speculated the decision may have been an attempt to seek the acceptance from others that he never received from his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=36}}\n\nThe same year Gacy became a Democratic candidate, his father bought him a car, with the title of the vehicle being in his father's name until Gacy had completed the monthly repayments.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=42}} These repayments took several years to complete, and his father would confiscate the keys to the vehicle if Gacy did not do as his father said. On one occasion in 1962, Gacy bought an extra set of keys after his father confiscated the original set. In response, his father removed the [[distributor cap]] from the vehicle, withholding the component for three days. \n\n==== Las Vegas ====\nGacy recalled that as a result of this incident, he felt \"totally sick; drained\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=44}} When his father replaced the distributor cap, Gacy left the family home and drove to [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], where he found work within the ambulance service before he was transferred to work as an attendant at Palm Mortuary. \n\n===== Palm Mortuary =====\nIn his role as a mortuary attendant, Gacy slept on a cot behind the [[embalming]] room.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Cahill|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OF6itYw0HT0C&pg=PT30&lpg=PT30#v=onepage&q/ |title=Buried Dreams: Inside the Mind of a Serial Killer|publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |location=New York City|date=1986|access-date=March 14, 2013|isbn=978-0553051155}}</ref> He worked in this role for three months.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} He observed morticians embalming dead bodies and later confessed that, on one evening while alone, he had clambered into the coffin of a deceased teenage male, embracing and caressing the body before experiencing a sense of shock.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}}{{efn|Gacy later claimed to have engaged in acts of [[necrophilia]] on approximately two occasions while he worked at Palm Mortuary. He justified his actions by claiming the bodies he had defiled were \"just dead things\" who \"couldn't tell anybody\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=346}}}} This prompted Gacy to call his mother the next day and ask whether his father would allow him to return home.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}} His father agreed and the same day, Gacy drove back to live with his family in Chicago.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=347}} \n\n==== Nunn-Bush Shoe Company ====\nUpon his return, despite the fact he had failed to graduate from high school, Gacy successfully enrolled in the [[Northwestern College (Illinois)|Northwestern Business College]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=47}} from which he graduated in 1963. Gacy subsequently took a management trainee position within the Nunn-Bush Shoe Company.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=18\u201319}} In 1964, the shoe company transferred Gacy to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] to work as a salesman.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} He was eventually promoted to manager of his department. In March of that year, he became engaged to Marlynn Myers, a co-worker in the department he managed.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}\n\n==== Springfield Jaycees ====\nDuring his courtship with Marlynn, Gacy joined the local [[Jaycees]] and became a tireless worker for the organization, being named Key Man for the organization in April 1964.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 58.</ref> The same year, Gacy had his second homosexual experience. According to Gacy, he acquiesced to this incident after one of his colleagues in the Springfield Jaycees plied him with drinks and invited him to spend the evening upon his sofa; the colleague then performed [[oral sex]] upon him while he was drunk.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish Printworks|location=London, England|issn=1364-5803 |page=7}}</ref> By 1965, Gacy had risen to the position of vice-president of the Springfield Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=20\u201322}} The same year, he was named as the third most outstanding Jaycee within the state of Illinois.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=48}}\n\n==Waterloo, Iowa==\nAfter a nine-month courtship, Gacy and Myers married in September 1964. Marlynn's father subsequently purchased three [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] restaurants in [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]], [[Iowa]], and the couple moved to Waterloo so he could manage the restaurants, with the understanding that they would move into Marlynn's parents' home (which was vacated for the couple).{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=261\u2013262}} The offer was lucrative: Gacy would receive $15,000 per year (the equivalent of $115,513 {{as of|2020|lc=y|df=US}}), plus a share of profits earned via the restaurants.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=50}} Following his obligatory completion of a managerial course, Gacy relocated to Waterloo with his wife later that year.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=23\u201325}}\n\n=== Waterloo Jaycees ===\nIn Waterloo, Gacy joined the local chapter of the Jaycees, regularly offering extended hours to the organization in addition to the 12- and 14-hour days he worked managing three restaurants. Although considered ambitious and something of a braggart by his colleagues in the Jaycees, he was highly regarded as a worker on several fund-raising projects. In 1967, he was named \"outstanding vice-president\" of the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=28}} At Jaycee meetings, Gacy often provided free fried chicken to his colleagues and insisted upon being given the nickname \"[[Colonel Sanders|Colonel]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=51}} The same year, Gacy served on the Board of Directors for the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=51}}\n\nGacy's wife gave birth to two children: a son was born in February 1966, followed by a daughter in March 1967. Gacy himself later described this period of his life as \"perfect\", adding that he finally earned the long-sought approval of his father. On one occasion in July 1966, Gacy's parents paid a visit to Iowa, during which his father apologized privately to him for the physical and emotional abuse he had inflicted on him throughout his childhood, before proudly informing him: \"Son, I was wrong about you.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=53}}\n\nHowever, there was an unseemlier side of Jaycee life in Waterloo that involved [[wife swapping]],<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> [[prostitution]], [[pornography]], and drug use. Gacy was deeply involved in many of these activities and regularly cheated on his wife with local prostitutes.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=263}} Much of this  happened at the Clayton House Motel. He is also known to have opened a \"club\" in his basement, where he allowed his employees to drink alcohol and play pool. Although Gacy employed teenagers of both sexes at his restaurants, he socialized only with his young male employees. Many were given alcohol before Gacy made sexual advances toward them, which, if rebuffed, he would claim were jokes or a test of morals.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}}\n\n====Assault of Donald Voorhees====\nIn August 1967, Gacy committed his first known [[sexual assault]] upon a teenage boy. The victim was 15-year-old Donald Voorhees, the son of a fellow Jaycee. Gacy lured Voorhees to his house with the promise of showing him pornographic films.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=55}} Gacy plied Voorhees with alcohol and persuaded the youth to perform oral sex upon him. Over the following months, several other youths were sexually abused in a similar manner, including one whom Gacy encouraged to have sex with his own wife before [[blackmail]]ing the youth into performing oral sex upon him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}} Gacy tricked several teenagers into believing he was commissioned with conducting homosexual experiments in the interests of \"scientific research\", for which each was paid up to $50.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=266}}\n\nIn March 1968, Voorhees reported to his father that Gacy had sexually assaulted him. Voorhees Sr. immediately informed the police and Gacy was arrested and subsequently charged with oral [[Sodomy law|sodomy]] in relation to Voorhees and the attempted assault of 16-year-old Edward Lynch.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=267}} Gacy vehemently denied the charges and demanded to take a [[polygraph test]]. This request was granted, although the results indicated Gacy was nervous when he denied any wrongdoing in relation to either Voorhees or Lynch.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n\nGacy publicly denied any wrongdoing and insisted the charges against him were politically motivated \u2013 Voorhees Sr. had opposed Gacy's nomination for appointment as president of the Iowa Jaycees.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=66}} Several fellow Jaycees found Gacy's story credible and rallied to his support. However, on May 10, 1968, Gacy was indicted on the sodomy charge.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n{{quote box\n| quote = ''\"The most striking aspect of the test results is the patient's total denial of responsibility for everything that has happened to him. He can produce an 'alibi' for everything. He presents himself as a victim of circumstances and blames other people who are out to get him ... the patient attempts to assure a sympathetic response by depicting himself as being at the mercy of a hostile environment.\"''\n| source = Section of report detailing Gacy's 1968 psychiatric evaluation.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=270}}\n| width = 30em\n}}\nOn August 30, 1968, Gacy persuaded one of his employees, 18-year-old Russell Schroeder, to [[assault|physically assault]] Voorhees in an effort to discourage the boy from testifying against him at the upcoming trial. Schroeder agreed to lure Voorhees to a secluded spot, spray [[Mace (spray)|Mace]] in his face and beat him. Gacy promised to pay Schroeder $300 if he followed through on the plot. In early September, Schroeder lured Voorhees to an isolated county park, sprayed Mace supplied by Gacy into the youth's eyes, then beat him, all the while shouting that he was not to testify against Gacy at his upcoming trial.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=72}}<ref name=\"Michael H.

The New Evil: Understanding the Emergence of Modern Violent Crime (Amherst, New York: Prometheus Books, 2019), pp. 196-203.</ref>\n\nVoorhees managed to escape, and immediately reported the assault to the police, identifying Schroeder as his attacker. Schroeder was arrested the following day. Despite initially denying any involvement, he soon confessed to having assaulted Voorhees, indicating that he had done so at Gacy's request. Gacy was arrested and additionally charged in relation to hiring Schroeder to assault and [[Witness tampering|intimidate]] Voorhees.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=268\u2013270}}\n\nOn September 12, Gacy was ordered to undergo a [[Psychological evaluation|psychiatric evaluation]] at the Psychiatric Hospital of the State University of Iowa.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=270}} Two doctors had examined Gacy over a period of 17 days before concluding he had an [[antisocial personality disorder]] (a disorder which incorporates constructs such as [[sociopathy]] and [[psychopathy]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/antisocial-personality-disorder |title=Antisocial Personality Disorder |magazine=[[Psychology Today]]|publisher=Sussex Publishers|location=New York City |date=April 19, 2017 |accessdate=January 13, 2018 }}</ref> was unlikely to benefit from any therapy or medical treatment, and that his behavior pattern was likely to bring him into repeated conflict with society.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} The doctors also concluded he was mentally competent to stand trial.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}}\n\n=====Conviction and imprisonment=====\n[[File:John Wayne Gacy (mugshot).jpg|thumb|[[Mug shot]]s of Gacy, following his December 1968 sodomy conviction]]\nUpon advice from his attorney, Gacy entered a plea of guilty to one count of sodomy in relation to the charges filed against him by Donald Voorhees. He pleaded not guilty to the other charges lodged against him by other youths at a formal [[arraignment]] held on November 7, 1968. Before the judge, Gacy contended that he and Voorhees had indeed engaged in sexual relations, yet he insisted Voorhees had offered his sexual services to him and that he had acted out of curiosity.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} His story was not believed. Despite his lawyers' recommendations for [[probation]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=84}} Gacy was convicted of sodomy on December 3, 1968,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} and sentenced to 10 years at the [[Anamosa State Penitentiary]].{{sfn|Peck|Dolch|2001|p=260}} On the day Gacy was convicted and sentenced, his wife petitioned for [[divorce]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=85}} requesting possession of the couple's home, property, sole custody of their two children and subsequent [[alimony]] payments.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=40}} The Court ruled in her favor and the divorce was finalized on September 18, 1969. Gacy never saw his first wife or children again.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=274}}\n\nDuring his incarceration in the Anamosa State Penitentiary, Gacy rapidly acquired a reputation as a model prisoner.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=273}} Within months of his arrival, he had risen to the position of head cook. He also joined the inmate Jaycee chapter and increased their membership figure from 50 to 650 in the span of less than 18 months. He is also known to have both secured an increase in the inmates' daily pay in the prison mess hall{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=88}} and to have supervised several projects to improve conditions for inmates at the prison.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=89}} On one occasion, Gacy oversaw the installation of a [[miniature golf]] course in the prison's recreation yard.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 62.</ref>\n\nIn June 1969, Gacy first applied to the State of Iowa Board of Parole for early release: this application was denied. In preparation for a second scheduled parole hearing in May 1970, Gacy completed 16 high school courses, for which he obtained his diploma in November 1969.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}}\n\nOn [[Christmas Day]] 1969, Gacy's father died from [[cirrhosis]] of the [[liver]].{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}} Gacy was not informed that his father had died until two days after his death. When he heard the news, Gacy was said to have collapsed to the floor, sobbing uncontrollably, and had to be supported by prison staff.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}} Gacy requested supervised compassionate leave from prison to attend his father's funeral in Chicago, but his request was denied.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|page=92}}\n\n==Return to Chicago==\nGacy was granted parole with 12 months' probation on June 18, 1970, after serving 18 months of his 10-year sentence.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=277}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=276}}{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=63}}{{sfn|Linedecker|1986|p=47}} Two of the conditions of his probation were for Gacy to relocate to Chicago to live with his mother and to observe a 10 p.m. [[curfew]],{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=276}} with the Iowa Board of Parole receiving regular updates as to his progress.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=96}}\n\nUpon his release, Gacy told friend and fellow Jaycee Clarence Lane\u2014who picked him up from the prison upon release and had remained steadfast in his belief of Gacy's innocence\u2014that he would \"never go back to jail\" and that he intended to re-establish himself in Waterloo. However, within 24 hours of his release, Gacy relocated to Chicago to live with his mother.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=276}} He arrived in Chicago on June 19 and shortly thereafter obtained a job as a [[short-order cook]] in a restaurant.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=49}}\n\nOn February 12, 1971, Gacy was charged with sexually assaulting a teenage boy.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=95}} The youth claimed that Gacy had lured him into his car at Chicago's [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound bus]] terminal and driven him to his home, where he had attempted to force the youth into sex. This complaint was subsequently dismissed when the youth failed to appear in court. The Iowa Board of Parole did not learn of this incident (which violated the conditions of his parole) and eight months later, in October 1971, Gacy's parole ended.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=96}} The following month, records of Gacy's previous criminal convictions in Iowa were subsequently [[Record sealing|sealed]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=53}}{{efn|Gacy successfully hid his [[criminal record]] from friends, business associates and political acquaintances; they only learned the truth of his past after police had begun investigating him for his later murders.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=72}}{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=73}}}}\n\n===8213 West Summerdale Avenue===\nWith financial assistance from his mother, Gacy bought a house in Norwood Park Township, an [[unincorporated area]] of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], a part of metropolitan Chicago. The address, 8213 West Summerdale Avenue, is where he resided until his arrest in December 1978 and where all his known murders were committed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=175}} He became active in his local community, and his neighbors considered him helpful; willing to loan his construction tools and plowing snow from neighborhood walks free of charge.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=86\u201387}} Between 1974 and 1978, he hosted annual summer parties attended by hundreds of people, including politicians.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=150}} \n\nIn August 1971, shortly after Gacy and his mother moved into the house, he became engaged to Carole Hoff, a [[divorcee]] with two young daughters. Hoff, whom he had briefly dated in high school, had been a friend of his younger sister. His fianc\u00e9e and stepdaughters moved into his home soon after the couple announced their engagement.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=55\u201359}} Gacy's mother subsequently moved out of the house shortly before his wedding, which was held on July 1, 1972.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=278}}\n\nOne week before Gacy's wedding, on June 22, he was arrested and charged with aggravated [[Sexual battery|battery]] and reckless conduct. The arrest was in response to a complaint filed by a youth, Jackie Dee, who informed police that Gacy, [[impersonating a police officer]], had flashed a sheriff's badge, lured him into his car, and forced him to perform oral sex.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=112}} These charges were later dropped after the complainant attempted to blackmail Gacy into paying money in exchange for dropping the charges.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=61\u201362}}\n\n===PDM Contractors===\nIn 1971, Gacy established a part-time construction business, PDM Contractors (PDM being the initials for 'Painting, Decorating, and Maintenance').{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=65}} With the approval of his probation officer, he was allowed to work evenings to commit to his employment contracts while working as a cook during the day. The business initially undertook minor repair work, such as sign-writing, pouring concrete, and redecorating, but later expanded to include projects such as interior design, [[remodeling]], installation, assembly, and [[landscaping]]. In mid-1973, Gacy quit his job as a cook in order that he could fully commit to his construction business.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=115}}\n\nMuch of the labor workforce consisted of high school students and young men.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=1}} In 1973, Gacy and a teenage employee of PDM Contractors traveled to [[Florida]] to view property Gacy had purchased. On the first night in Florida, Gacy raped the youth in their hotel room.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=118}} As a result, the youth refused to stay in the same hotel room as Gacy and instead slept on the beach. Upon returning to Chicago, he drove to Gacy's house and beat him in his yard. Gacy's mother-in-law stopped the assault and he drove away. Gacy explained to his wife that the attack happened because he had refused to pay the youth for poor quality painting work.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\nAnother employee of Gacy's was 15-year-old Anthony Antonucci, whom he had hired in May 1975. In July 1975, Gacy arrived at Antonucci's home while the youth was alone, having injured his foot at work the day prior. Gacy plied him with alcohol, wrestled him to the floor and cuffed his hands behind his back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} The cuff upon Antonucci's right wrist was loose: Antonucci freed his arm from the [[handcuffs|handcuff]] after Gacy left the room. When Gacy returned, Antonucci\u2014a member of his high school wrestling team\u2014pounced upon him. He wrestled Gacy to the floor, obtained possession of the handcuff key and cuffed Gacy's hands behind his back. Gacy screamed threats, then calmed down and promised to leave if Antonucci removed the handcuffs. The youth agreed and Gacy left the house.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} Antonucci later recalled that Gacy had told him as he lay prone on the floor: \"Not only are you the only one who got out of the cuffs; you got them on me.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=123}}\n\nBy 1975, PDM Contractors was expanding rapidly; by his own later admission, he began working 12- and 16-hour days to fulfill agreed commitments upon an increasing number of contracts.

In the time he had worked for Gacy, he had informed his family Gacy had had him \"dig trenches for some kind of (drain) tiles\" in his crawl space.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=184}} Godzik's car was later found abandoned in [[Niles, Illinois|Niles]]. His parents and older sister, Eugenia, contacted Gacy about Greg's disappearance. Gacy claimed to the family that Greg had run away from home, having indicated to Gacy before his disappearance that he wished to do so. Gacy also claimed to have received an [[answering machine]] message from Godzik shortly after he had disappeared. When asked if he could play back the message to Godzik's parents, Gacy stated that he had erased it.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=184}}{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=92\u201393}}\n\n===1977===\nA month later, on January 20, 1977, John Szyc, a 19-year-old acquaintance of Butkovich, Godzik, and Gacy, disappeared. Szyc was lured to Gacy's house on the pretext of selling his [[Plymouth Satellite#Third Generation (1971-1974)|Plymouth Satellite]] to Gacy. He was buried in Gacy's crawl space directly above the body of Godzik.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=207}}\n\nIn August 1977, Michael Rossi, who had bought Szyc's car from Gacy, was arrested for stealing gasoline from a service station while driving the car. The attendant noted the license plate number and police traced the car to Gacy's house. When questioned, Gacy told officers that Szyc had sold the car to him in February with the explanation that he needed money to leave town. A check of the [[Vehicle Identification Number|VIN]] number confirmed the car had belonged to Szyc.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 78</ref> The police did not pursue the matter further,{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=95\u201397}} although they did inform Szyc's mother that her son had sold his car to Gacy in February.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=184}}\n\nBetween December 1976 and March 1977, Gacy is known to have killed an unidentified man estimated to be around 25 years old.<ref name=\"Case File 958UMIL\">{{cite web|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/958umil.html |title=Case File 958UMIL |publisher=The Doe Network |access-date=July 18, 2010}}</ref> An inscription upon a [[key fob]] found among the personal artifacts buried with this unknown victim suggests his first name may have been Greg or Gregory.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://identifyus.org/en/cases/10994|title=NamUs \u2013 National Unidentified Persons Data System|publisher=}}</ref> His body was buried in the crawl space beneath the body of 20-year-old Jon Prestidge, a Michigan man visiting friends in Chicago whom Gacy killed on March 15.

He was buried parallel to the wall of Gacy's crawl space directly beneath the entrance to his home. The two victims murdered on the same day in May 1976 were buried alongside him, yet sequential burial patterns of three victims murdered in 1977 leave an equal possibility this particular victim may have been murdered in the spring or summer of 1977.

As a result of this contract, Gacy regularly traveled to other states to supervise construction projects and he later stated that, through both businesses (PDM Contractors and PE Systems), he often simultaneously worked on up to four construction projects,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=180}} with almost 80 buildings being successfully remodeled in 1977 alone. In April 1977,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=179}} Michael Rossi moved out of Gacy's home; the same month, Gacy became temporarily engaged to a woman he had been dating for three months, and his fianc\u00e9e moved into his house.

Rignall was then driven to [[Lincoln Park, Chicago|Lincoln Park]], where he was dumped, unconscious but alive. \n\nEventually, he managed to stagger to his girlfriend's apartment.  Police were again informed of the assault but did not investigate Gacy. Rignall was able to recall, through the chloroform haze of that night, Gacy's distinctive black [[Oldsmobile 88#1977\u20131985|Oldsmobile]], the [[Kennedy Expressway]] and particular side streets.

Less than three weeks later, on November 24, a 20-year-old [[Elmwood Park, Illinois|Elmwood Park]] resident, James Mazzara, disappeared after sharing Thanksgiving dinner with his family; his body was found on December 28. The cause of death in the case of Landingin was certified as suffocation through the youth's own underwear being lodged down his throat, plugging his airway{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=275}} and effectively causing him to drown in his own vomit.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=276}} Mazzara had been strangled with a ligature.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=225}}\n\n=====Murder of Robert Piest=====\n[[File:Piest1.jpg|200px|thumb|Robert Piest, whose abduction and murder ultimately led to Gacy's arrest and the discoveries upon his property.]]\nOn the afternoon of December 11, 1978, Gacy visited the Nisson Pharmacy in [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]] to discuss a potential remodeling deal with store owner Phil Torf. While Gacy was within earshot of 15-year-old, part-time employee Robert Piest, he mentioned that his firm hired teenage boys at a starting wage of $5 per hour\u2014almost double the pay Piest earned at the pharmacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=5\u20136}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=4}}\n\nShortly after Gacy left the pharmacy, Piest informed his mother\u2014who had arrived at the pharmacy to drive her son home\u2014that \"some contractor wants to talk to me about a job\". Piest left the store, promising to return shortly.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=7}} Gacy murdered him at his house; he had been interrupted by a phone call from a business colleague while strangling him.\n\n==Investigation==\nWhen Piest failed to return, his family filed a [[missing person]] report on their son with the Des Plaines police. Torf named Gacy as the contractor Piest had most likely left the store to talk with about a job.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), pp. 25-26</ref> [[Joseph R. Kozenczak]] pursued the investigation. \n\nKozenczak and two other Des Plaines police officers visited Gacy at his home the following evening. Gacy indicated he had seen two youths working at the pharmacy and that he had asked one of them\u2014whom he believed to be Piest\u2014whether any remodeling materials were present in the rear of the store.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=19\u201321}} He was adamant, however, that he had not offered Piest a job and promised to come to the station later that evening to make a statement confirming this, indicating he was unable to do so at that moment as his uncle had just died. When the police still wanted to meet Gacy that evening, he responded: \"You guys are very rude. Don't you have any respect for the dead?\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=240}}\n\nAt 3:20&nbsp;a.m., Gacy, covered in mud, arrived at the police station, claiming he had been involved in a car accident.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=23}} Upon returning to the police station later that day, Gacy denied any involvement in the disappearance of Piest and repeated that he had not offered him a job. When asked why he had returned to the pharmacy at 8 p.m. Gacy claimed he had done so in response to a phone call from Torf informing him he had left his appointment book at the store. Detectives had already spoken with Torf, who had stated he had placed no such call to Gacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=27}} At the request of detectives, Gacy prepared a written statement detailing his movements on December 11.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=28}}\n\n===Revelations===\nDes Plaines police were convinced Gacy was behind Piest's disappearance and checked Gacy's record, discovering that he had an outstanding battery charge against him in Chicago and had served a prison sentence in Iowa for the sodomy of a 15-year-old boy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=17}} A search of Gacy's house on December 13 was ordered by a judge at the request of detectives and revealed several suspicious items. These included a [[syringe]], several police badges, and a 6mm Brevettata [[starter pistol]]. They also found handcuffs, books on homosexuality and [[pederasty]], a 39 inch long [[Dimensional lumber#Dimensional lumber|two-by-four]] with two holes drilled into each end,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=33}} several driver's licenses, a blue hooded parka and underwear too small to fit Gacy.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 61</ref>\n\nIn the northwest bedroom, investigators found a [[Maine West High School]] ring. This item initially interested investigators as Piest had attended Maine West, but the ring was not his. It was a class of 1975 ring engraved with the initials J.A.S.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=243}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=87}} A photo receipt from Nisson Pharmacy was also recovered from a trash can.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 61</ref>\n\nGacy's Oldsmobile and other PDM work vehicles were confiscated by the Des Plaines police, who assigned two two-man [[surveillance]] teams to monitor Gacy on a rotational twelve-hour basis as they continued their investigation into his background and potential involvement in Piest's disappearance.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Murder casebook number 84 {{ISBN|0-7485-1454-6}}, p. 1915</ref> These surveillance teams consisted of officers Mike Albrecht and David Hachmeister, and Ronald Robinson and Robert Schultz. {{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=41}}\n\nThe following day, investigators received a phone call from Michael Rossi, who informed the investigators both of Gregory Godzik's disappearance{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=53}} and the fact that another PDM employee, Charles Hattula, had been found drowned in an Illinois river the previous year.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=123}}\n\nOn December 15, Des Plaines investigators obtained further details upon Gacy's battery charge, learning the complainant, Jeffrey Rignall, had reported that Gacy had lured him into his car, chloroformed him, raped him and dumped him, with severe chest and facial burns and rectal bleeding, in Lincoln Park the following morning. In an interview with Gacy's former wife the same day, they learned of the disappearance of John Butkovich.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=84}} The same day, the Maine West High School ring was traced to a John Alan Szyc.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=53\u201355}} In an interview with Szyc's mother the same day, she informed officers of the January 1977 disappearance of her son and that several items from his apartment were also missing, including a Motorola TV set.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 117</ref>\n\nBy December 16, Gacy was becoming affable with the surveillance detectives, regularly inviting them to join him for meals in restaurants and occasionally for drinks in bars or within his home. He repeatedly denied that he had anything to do with Piest's disappearance and accused the officers of harassing him because of his political connections or because of his recreational drug use. Knowing these officers were unlikely to arrest him on anything trivial, he openly taunted them by flouting traffic laws and succeeded in losing his pursuers on more than one occasion.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=89}}\n\nOn December 17, investigators conducted a formal interview of Michael Rossi, who informed them Gacy had sold Szyc's vehicle to him with the explanation that he had bought the car from Szyc because the youth needed money to move to California. A further examination of Gacy's Oldsmobile was conducted on this date. In the course of examining the trunk of the car, the investigators discovered a small cluster of fibers which may have been human hair. These fibers were sent for further analysis. That evening, officers conducted a test using three trained [[German shepherd]] [[Search and rescue dog|search dogs]] to determine whether Piest had been present in any of Gacy's vehicles.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}} The dogs were allowed to examine each of Gacy's vehicles, whereupon one dog approached Gacy's Oldsmobile and lay upon the passenger seat in what the dog's handler informed investigators was a \"death reaction\", indicating the body of Robert Piest had been present in this vehicle.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}}\n\nThat evening, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives to a restaurant for a meal. In the early hours of December 18, he invited the same officers into another restaurant where, over breakfast, he talked of his business, his marriages and his activities as a registered clown. At one point during this conversation, Gacy remarked to one of the two surveillance detectives: \"You know\u2026 clowns can get away with murder.\"{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=226}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=90}}\n\n===Civil suit===\nBy December 18, Gacy was beginning to show visible signs of strain as a result of the constant surveillance: he was unshaven, looked tired, appeared anxious and was drinking heavily. That afternoon, he drove to his lawyers' office to prepare a $750,000 [[civil suit]] against the Des Plaines police,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=102}} demanding that they cease their surveillance. The same day, the serial number of the Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt found in Gacy's kitchen was traced to 17-year-old Kim Byers, a colleague of Piest at Nisson Pharmacy, who admitted when contacted in person the following day that she had worn the jacket and had placed the receipt in the [[Anorak|parka]] pocket just before she gave the parka to Piest as he left the store to talk with a contractor.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=110}} This revelation contradicted Gacy's previous statements that he had had no contact with Robert Piest on the evening of December 11.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\nThe same evening, Michael Rossi was interviewed a second time: on this occasion, Rossi was more cooperative, informing detectives that in the summer of 1977, Gacy had had him spread ten bags of [[Lime (material)|lime]] in the crawl space of the house.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}}\n\nOn December 19, investigators began compiling evidence for a second search warrant of Gacy's house. The same day, Gacy's lawyers filed the civil suit against the Des Plaines police. The hearing of the suit was scheduled for December 22. That afternoon, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives inside his house. On this occasion, as one officer distracted Gacy with conversation, another officer walked into Gacy's bedroom in an unsuccessful attempt to write down the serial number of the Motorola TV set they suspected belonged to John Szyc. While flushing Gacy's toilet, this officer noticed a smell he suspected could be that of rotting corpses emanating from a [[heating duct]]; the officers who previously searched Gacy's house had failed to notice this, as on that occasion the house had been cold.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nBoth David Cram and Michael Rossi were interviewed by investigators on December 20. Rossi had agreed to be interviewed in relation to his possible links with John Szyc as well as the disappearance of Robert Piest. When questioned by Detective [[Joseph R.

Cram then stated Gacy had grabbed a flashlight and immediately entered the crawl space to look for evidence of digging. When asked whether he had been to the crawl space, Cram replied he had been asked by Gacy to spread lime down there and also dug trenches upon Gacy's behest with the explanation they were for plumbing.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}} Cram stated these trenches were {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} wide, {{convert|6|ft|m|sp=us}} long and {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} deep\u2014the size of graves.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=143\u2013145}}\n\n===Verbal confession===\nOn the evening of December 20, Gacy drove to his lawyers' office in [[Park Ridge, Illinois|Park Ridge]] to attend a pre-scheduled meeting he had arranged with them, ostensibly to discuss the progress of his civil suit. Upon his arrival, Gacy appeared disheveled and immediately asked for an alcoholic drink, whereupon Sam Amirante fetched a bottle of whiskey from his car. Upon his return, Amirante asked Gacy what he had to discuss with them. Gacy picked up a copy of the ''[[Chicago Daily Herald|Daily Herald]]'' from Amirante's desk; he pointed to a front-page article covering the disappearance of Robert Piest and informed his lawyers: \"This boy is dead. He's in a river.\"{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=136}}\n\nOver the following hours, Gacy gave a rambling confession that ran into the early hours of the following morning. He began by informing Amirante and Stevens he had \"been the judge ... jury and executioner of many, many people\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 127</ref> most of whom he stated were buried in his crawl space, and others in the Des Plaines River. Some victims he referred to by name; most he dismissed as \"[[Male prostitution|male prostitutes]]\", \"hustlers\" and \"liars\" to whom he gave \"the rope trick\". On other occasions, he stated he woke up to find \"dead, strangled kids\" on his floor, with their hands cuffed behind their back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=171}} In reference to Robert Piest, Gacy stated that as he placed the tourniquet around his neck, that Piest was \"crying, scared\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 140</ref>\n\nAs a result of the alcohol he had consumed, Gacy fell asleep midway through his confession and Amirante immediately arranged a psychiatric appointment for Gacy at 9 a.m. that morning.

Jacobson immediately handed the bag to the surveillance officers, adding that Gacy had told him: \"The end is coming (for me). These guys are going to kill me.\" Gacy then drove to the home of a fellow contractor, Ronald Rhode. Inside Rhode's living room, Gacy hugged Rhode before bursting into tears and saying: \"I killed thirty people, give or take a few.\" Gacy then left Rhode's home to meet with Michael Rossi and David Cram. As he drove along the expressway, the surveillance officers noted he was holding a [[Catholic rosary|rosary]] to his chin as he prayed while driving.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=152}}\n\nAfter talking with Cram and Rossi at Cram's home, Gacy had Cram drive him to a scheduled meeting with Leroy Stevens. As he spoke with his lawyer, Cram informed the officers that Gacy had earlier divulged to both himself and Rossi that the previous evening, he had confessed to his lawyers his guilt in over thirty murders. Upon concluding his meeting with his lawyer, Gacy had Cram drive him to Maryhill Cemetery, where his father was buried.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=259}}\n\nAs Gacy drove to various locations that morning, police outlined their formal draft of their second search warrant. The purpose of the warrant was specifically to search for the body of Robert Piest in the crawl space. Upon hearing radioed reports from the surveillance detectives that, in light of his erratic behavior, Gacy might be about to commit suicide, police decided to arrest him upon a charge of possession and distribution of marijuana{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=157}} in order to hold him in custody as the formal request for a second search warrant was presented. At 4:30 on the afternoon of December 21, the eve of the hearing of Gacy's civil suit, the request for a second search warrant was granted by Judge Marvin J. Peters.<ref>Kozenczak, (2012) p. 158</ref>\n\nArmed with the signed search warrant, police and evidence technicians quickly drove to Gacy's home. Upon their arrival, officers found that Gacy had unplugged his [[sump pump]] and that the crawl space was flooded with water; to clear the water they simply replaced the plug and waited for the water to drain. After it had done so, evidence technician Daniel Genty entered the {{convert|28|x|38|ft|adj=on}} crawl space,<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 50.</ref> crawled to the southwest area, and began digging.

Amirante argued against the testimony delivered by the doctors who had testified for the prosecution, repeatedly citing the testimony of the four psychiatrists and psychologists who had testified on behalf of the defense.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=360}} Amirante also accused Sullivan of scarcely referring to the evidence presented throughout the trial in his own closing argument, and of arousing hatred against his client. The defense lawyer attempted to portray Gacy as a \"man driven by compulsions he was unable to control\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=363}}\n\nIn support of these arguments, the defense counsel repeatedly referred to the testimony of the doctors who had appeared for the defense, in addition to the testimony of defense witnesses such as Jeffrey Rignall and Gacy's former business associate Mickel Reed\u2014both of whom had testified to their belief that Gacy had been unable to control his actions.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=359}} Amirante then urged the jury to put aside any prejudice they held against his client, and requested they deliver a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, adding that the psychology of Gacy's behavior would be of benefit to scientific research and that the psychology of his mind should be studied.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=361}}\n\n[[File:Kunkletrial.jpg|200px|thumb|William Kunkle, prosecutor at Gacy's trial, standing before a board depicting the 22 victims identified by February 1980.]]\nOn the morning of March 12,{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=364}} William Kunkle continued to argue for the prosecution. Kunkle referred to the defense's contention of insanity as \"a [[falsity|sham]]\", arguing that the facts of the case demonstrated Gacy's ability to think logically and control his actions. Kunkle also referred to the testimony of a doctor who had examined Gacy in 1968. This doctor had diagnosed Gacy as an [[antisocial personality]], capable of committing crimes without remorse. Kunkle indicated that had the recommendations of this doctor been heeded, Gacy would have not been freed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}}\n\nAt the close of his argument, Kunkle pulled each of the 22 photos of Gacy's identified victims off a board displaying the images and asked the jury not to show sympathy but to \"show justice\". Kunkle then asked the jury to \"show the same sympathy this man showed when he took these lives and put them ''there!''{{-\"}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}} before throwing the stack of photos into the opening of the trap door of Gacy's crawl space, which had been introduced as evidence and was on display in the courtroom.

Gacy's appeals related to issues such as the validity of the first search warrant granted to Des Plaines police on December 13, 1978, and his objection to his lawyers' insanity plea defense at his trial.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=344}} Gacy also contended that, although he held \"some knowledge\" of five of the murders (those of McCoy, Butkovich, Godzik, Szyc and Piest),{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=347}} the other 28 murders had been committed by employees who were in possession of keys to his house while he was away on business trips.\n\nIn mid-1984, the [[Supreme Court of Illinois]] upheld Gacy's conviction and ordered that he be executed by lethal injection on November 14.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=351}} Gacy filed an appeal against this decision, which was denied by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] on March 4, 1985. The following year, Gacy filed a further post-conviction petition, seeking a new trial. His then-defense lawyer, [[Richard Kling]], argued that Gacy had been provided with ineffective legal counsel at his 1980 trial.

Amirante has since stated that the primary inspiration for this legislation was the fact that at the time of the Gacy murders, there had been a 72-hour period which police in Illinois had to allow to elapse before initiating a search for a missing child or adolescent.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\nThe Illinois Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984 removed this 72-hour waiting period. Other states across America subsequently adopted similar procedures and sensibilities, as a result of which a national network aimed at locating missing children was gradually formed. This national network has since developed into the Child Abduction Emergency\u2014commonly known today as an [[Amber Alert]].{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\n==Potential accomplices and connections==\nOne of the first things Gacy told investigators after his arrest was that he had not acted alone in several of the murders: he asked whether \"my associates\" had also been arrested.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} When questioned as to whether these associates had participated directly or indirectly in the killings, Gacy replied, \"Directly.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}}\n\nGacy specifically named Cram and Rossi as being involved in several of the murders.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} In the 1980s, he also informed [[Robert Ressler]] that \"two or three\" PDM employees had assisted him in several murders.<ref>Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} pp 341\u2013342</ref> Ressler replied that he believed there were unexplained avenues to the case and stated his belief that Gacy had killed more than 33 victims.

The first documentary focusing upon Gacy's crimes was commissioned for the ''[[Most Evil]]'' series, a forensics program in which [[forensic psychiatrist]] Michael Stone analyzes various murderers and psychopaths. The second Investigation Discovery program on Gacy is featured in the ''Evil Lives Here'' series. This program explores how Gacy's actions affected his family. Gacy's sister and niece are among those interviewed.\n* The [[Biography Channel]] has broadcast a 45-minute documentary on the crimes of John Wayne Gacy.\n* The television program, ''Psychic Investigators'', has broadcast an episode entitled \"What Lies Below\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/tv-programme/e/z2hr/psychic-investigators--s3-e3-what-lies-below |title=Psychic Investigators S3-E3: What Lies Below |publisher=radiotimes.com |date=July 25, 2009 |access-date=February 14, 2017}}</ref> This program focuses upon the consultation between Detective Joseph Kozenczak and [[psychic]] Carol Broman, whom Kozenczak had met on December 17, 1978 to discuss the whereabouts of the body of Robert Piest.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), pp. 104\u2013105</ref>\n* The [[Lifetime Movies]] network series ''[[Monster in My Family]]'' has broadcast a 42-minute episode focusing on the murders committed by Gacy. This episode, titled \"Killer Clown: John Wayne Gacy\", was initially broadcast in August 2015.

During the time of the murders, he remained active in his community, regularly performing at events as his own characters, \"Pogo the [[Clown]]\" or \"Patches the Clown\", and so is known as the \"Killer Clown\". His first murder occurred in 1972 and at least 30 of his subsequent murders were committed after the divorce of his second wife in 1976. Investigation into the case of missing [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]] teenager Robert Piest led to Gacy's arrest on December 21, 1978.\n\nGacy was convicted of the [[sodomy]] of a teenage boy in Iowa in 1968. He was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, but was released from prison on good behavior; and returned to his home state of Illinois. It is believed all of his known murders were committed inside his [[Ranch-style house|ranch house]] in [[Norwood Park Township, Cook County, Illinois|Norwood Park]], a part of [[Chicago metropolitan area|metropolitan Chicago]]. Once lured to his home by force or deception, his victims were typically duped into donning [[handcuffs]] on the pretext of being shown a [[Magic (illusion)|magic trick]] and then raped and tortured before being murdered by either [[asphyxiation]] or [[strangulation]] with a makeshift [[garrote]].\n\n26 of Gacy's victims were buried in the [[Crawl space (basement)|crawl space]] of his home. Three other victims were buried elsewhere on his property, while the bodies of his last four known victims were discarded in the [[Des Plaines River]]. The conviction for 33 murders was then the largest number of murders charged to one individual in United States history. Gacy was sentenced to death on March 13, 1980 for 12 of those murders. He spent 14 years on death row at [[Menard Correctional Center]], spending much of his time painting, and was executed by [[lethal injection]] at [[Stateville Correctional Center]] on May 10, 1994.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Wayne Gacy was born in Chicago, [[Illinois]] on March 17, 1942, the second child and only son of John Stanley Gacy (June 20, 1900 \u2013 December 25, 1969) and Marion Elaine Robinson (May 4, 1908 \u2013 December 6, 1989).<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 63.</ref> His father was an auto repair machinist and [[World War I]] veteran,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=24}} and his mother was a homemaker.<ref>Cook County marriage records provide his mother's name as Marion E.

He was close to his two sisters and mother but endured a difficult relationship with his father, an [[alcoholic]] who was [[physical abuse|physically abusive]] to his wife and children.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=256\u2013257}} Gacy seldom received his approval. He later recollected he was \"never good enough\" in his father's eyes.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=31}}  His father regularly belittled him, calling him \"dumb and stupid\" and comparing him unfavorably with his sisters.<ref>''Serial Killers.'' pp. 54\u201355.</ref> Despite this, Gacy always denied ever hating his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=21}} \n\nOne of Gacy's earliest childhood memories was of being beaten with a leather belt at the age of four for accidentally disarranging car engine components his father had assembled.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=18\u201319}} On another occasion, he was struck across the head with a broomstick and rendered [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]].<ref>{{cite book | first1=Jason| last1=Moss| first2=Jeffrey| last2=Kottler| title=The Last Victim: A True-life Journey into the Mind of the Serial Killer| publisher=Grand Central Publishing| location=New York City| date=2000|isbn=0-7535-0398-0| p=103}}</ref> When he was six years old, Gacy stole a toy truck from a neighborhood store. His mother made him walk back to the store, return the toy and apologize to the owners. His mother informed his father, who beat Gacy with a belt as punishment. After this incident, Gacy's mother attempted to shield her son from his father's verbal and physical abuse,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=26}} yet this only succeeded in Gacy earning accusations that he was a \"[[sissy]]\" and a \"Mama's boy\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} who would \"probably grow up [[queer]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=40}}\n\nIn 1949, Gacy's father was informed that his son and another boy had been caught sexually fondling a young girl.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=218}} Gacy's father whipped him with a [[razor strop]] as punishment. The same year,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=17}} Gacy was [[child molestation|molested]] by a family friend,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} a contractor who would take Gacy for rides in his truck and then fondle him. Gacy never told his father about these incidents, afraid that his father would blame him.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\">''Serial Killers''. p. 54.</ref>\n\nBecause of a heart condition, Gacy was ordered to avoid all sports at school.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\" /> During the fourth grade, Gacy began to experience [[Syncope (medicine)|blackout]]s. He was occasionally hospitalized because of these seizures, and also in 1957 for a [[appendicitis|burst appendix]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=18}} Gacy later estimated that between the ages of 14 and 18, he had spent almost a year in the hospital for these episodes, and attributed the decline of his grades to his missing school. His father suspected the episodes were an effort to gain sympathy and attention, and openly accused his son of faking the condition as the boy lay in a hospital bed.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |issn=1364-5803 |page=5}}</ref> Although his mother, sisters, and few close friends never doubted his illness, Gacy's medical condition was never conclusively diagnosed.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=32}}\n\nOne of Gacy's friends at high school recalled several instances in which his father ridiculed or beat his son without provocation. On one occasion in 1957, the same friend witnessed an incident at the Gacy household in which Gacy's father began shouting at his son for no reason, then began hitting him.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=33}} Gacy's mother attempted to intervene. The friend recalled that Gacy simply \"put up his hands to defend himself\", adding that he never struck his father back during these physical altercations.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n===Career origins===\nIn 1960, at the age of 18, Gacy became involved in politics, working as an assistant [[precinct captain]] for a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] candidate in his neighborhood. This decision earned more criticism from his father, who accused his son of being a \"[[wikt:Special:Search/dupe|patsy]]\". Gacy later speculated the decision may have been an attempt to seek the acceptance from others that he never received from his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=36}}\n\nThe same year Gacy became a Democratic candidate, his father bought him a car, with the title of the vehicle being in his father's name until Gacy had completed the monthly repayments.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=42}} These repayments took several years to complete, and his father would confiscate the keys to the vehicle if Gacy did not do as his father said. On one occasion in 1962, Gacy bought an extra set of keys after his father confiscated the original set. In response, his father removed the [[distributor cap]] from the vehicle, withholding the component for three days. \n\n==== Run away to Las Vegas ====\nGacy recalled that as a result of this incident, he felt \"totally sick; drained\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=44}} When his father replaced the distributor cap, Gacy left the family home and drove to [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], where he found work within the ambulance service before he was transferred to work as an attendant at Palm Mortuary. \n\n===== Palm Mortuary =====\nIn his role as a mortuary attendant, Gacy slept on a cot behind the [[embalming]] room.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Cahill|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OF6itYw0HT0C&pg=PT30&lpg=PT30#v=onepage&q/ |title=Buried Dreams: Inside the Mind of a Serial Killer|publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |location=New York City|date=1986|access-date=March 14, 2013|isbn=978-0553051155}}</ref> He worked in this role for three months.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} He observed morticians embalming dead bodies and later confessed that, on one evening while alone, he had clambered into the coffin of a deceased teenage male, embracing and caressing the body before experiencing a sense of shock.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}}{{efn|Gacy later claimed to have engaged in acts of [[necrophilia]] on approximately two occasions while he worked at Palm Mortuary. He justified his actions by claiming the bodies he had defiled were \"just dead things\" who \"couldn't tell anybody\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=346}}}} This prompted Gacy to call his mother the next day and ask whether his father would allow him to return home.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}} His father agreed and the same day, Gacy drove back to live with his family in Chicago.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=347}} \n\n==== Nunn-Bush Shoe Company ====\nUpon his return, despite the fact he had failed to graduate from high school, Gacy successfully enrolled in the [[Northwestern College (Illinois)|Northwestern Business College]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=47}} from which he graduated in 1963. Gacy subsequently took a management trainee position within the Nunn-Bush Shoe Company.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=18\u201319}} In 1964, the shoe company transferred Gacy to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] to work as a salesman.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} He was eventually promoted to manager of his department. In March of that year, he became engaged to Marlynn Myers, a co-worker in the department he managed.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}\n\n==== Springfield Jaycees ====\nDuring his courtship with Marlynn, Gacy joined the local [[Jaycees]] and became a tireless worker for the organization, being named Key Man for the organization in April 1964.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 58.</ref> The same year, Gacy had his second homosexual experience. According to Gacy, he acquiesced to this incident after one of his colleagues in the Springfield Jaycees plied him with drinks and invited him to spend the evening upon his sofa; the colleague then performed [[oral sex]] upon him while he was drunk.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish Printworks|location=London, England|issn=1364-5803 |page=7}}</ref> By 1965, Gacy had risen to the position of vice-president of the Springfield Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=20\u201322}} The same year, he was named as the third most outstanding Jaycee within the state of Illinois.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=48}}\n\n==Waterloo, Iowa==\nAfter a nine-month courtship, Gacy and Myers married in September 1964. Marlynn's father subsequently purchased three [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] restaurants in [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]], [[Iowa]], and the couple moved to Waterloo so he could manage the restaurants, with the understanding that they would move into Marlynn's parents' home (which was vacated for the couple).{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=261\u2013262}} The offer was lucrative: Gacy would receive $15,000 per year (the equivalent of $115,513 {{as of|2020|lc=y|df=US}}), plus a share of profits earned via the restaurants.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=50}} Following his obligatory completion of a managerial course, Gacy relocated to Waterloo with his wife later that year.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=23\u201325}}\n\n=== Waterloo Jaycees ===\nIn Waterloo, Gacy joined the local chapter of the Jaycees, regularly offering extended hours to the organization in addition to the 12- and 14-hour days he worked managing three restaurants. Although considered ambitious and something of a braggart by his colleagues in the Jaycees, he was highly regarded as a worker on several fund-raising projects. In 1967, he was named \"outstanding vice-president\" of the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=28}} At Jaycee meetings, Gacy often provided free fried chicken to his colleagues and insisted upon being given the nickname \"[[Colonel Sanders|Colonel]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=51}} The same year, Gacy served on the Board of Directors for the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=51}}\n\nGacy's wife gave birth to two children: a son was born in February 1966, followed by a daughter in March 1967. Gacy himself later described this period of his life as \"perfect\", adding that he finally earned the long-sought approval of his father. On one occasion in July 1966, Gacy's parents paid a visit to Iowa, during which his father apologized privately to him for the physical and emotional abuse he had inflicted on him throughout his childhood, before proudly informing him: \"Son, I was wrong about you.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=53}}\n\nHowever, there was an unseemlier side of Jaycee life in Waterloo that involved [[wife swapping]],<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> [[prostitution]], [[pornography]], and drug use. Gacy was deeply involved in many of these activities and regularly cheated on his wife with local prostitutes.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=263}} Much of this  happened at the Clayton House Motel. He is also known to have opened a \"club\" in his basement, where he allowed his employees to drink alcohol and play pool. Although Gacy employed teenagers of both sexes at his restaurants, he socialized only with his young male employees. Many were given alcohol before Gacy made sexual advances toward them, which, if rebuffed, he would claim were jokes or a test of morals.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}}\n\n====Assault of Donald Voorhees====\nIn August 1967, Gacy committed his first known [[sexual assault]] upon a teenage boy. The victim was 15-year-old Donald Voorhees, the son of a fellow Jaycee. Gacy lured Voorhees to his house with the promise of showing him pornographic films.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=55}} Gacy plied Voorhees with alcohol and persuaded the youth to perform oral sex upon him. Over the following months, several other youths were sexually abused in a similar manner, including one whom Gacy encouraged to have sex with his own wife before [[blackmail]]ing the youth into performing oral sex upon him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}} Gacy tricked several teenagers into believing he was commissioned with conducting homosexual experiments in the interests of \"scientific research\", for which each was paid up to $50.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=266}}\n\nIn March 1968, Voorhees reported to his father that Gacy had sexually assaulted him. Voorhees Sr. immediately informed the police and Gacy was arrested and subsequently charged with oral [[Sodomy law|sodomy]] in relation to Voorhees and the attempted assault of 16-year-old Edward Lynch.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=267}} Gacy vehemently denied the charges and demanded to take a [[polygraph test]]. This request was granted, although the results indicated Gacy was nervous when he denied any wrongdoing in relation to either Voorhees or Lynch.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n\nGacy publicly denied any wrongdoing and insisted the charges against him were politically motivated \u2013 Voorhees Sr. had opposed Gacy's nomination for appointment as president of the Iowa Jaycees.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=66}} Several fellow Jaycees found Gacy's story credible and rallied to his support.

Schroeder agreed to lure Voorhees to a secluded spot, spray [[Mace (spray)|Mace]] in his face and beat him. Gacy promised to pay Schroeder $300 if he followed through on the plot. In early September, Schroeder lured Voorhees to an isolated county park, sprayed Mace supplied by Gacy into the youth's eyes, then beat him, all the while shouting that he was not to testify against Gacy at his upcoming trial.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=72}}<ref name=\"Michael H.

Schroeder was arrested the following day. Despite initially denying any involvement, he soon confessed to having assaulted Voorhees, indicating that he had done so at Gacy's request.

He pleaded not guilty to the other charges lodged against him by other youths at a formal [[arraignment]] held on November 7, 1968. Before the judge, Gacy contended that he and Voorhees had indeed engaged in sexual relations, yet he insisted Voorhees had offered his sexual services to him and that he had acted out of curiosity.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} His story was not believed. Despite his lawyers' recommendations for [[probation]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=84}} Gacy was convicted of sodomy on December 3, 1968,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} and sentenced to 10 years at the [[Anamosa State Penitentiary]].{{sfn|Peck|Dolch|2001|p=260}} On the day Gacy was convicted and sentenced, his wife petitioned for [[divorce]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=85}} requesting possession of the couple's home, property, sole custody of their two children and subsequent [[alimony]] payments.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=40}} The Court ruled in her favor and the divorce was finalized on September 18, 1969.

He also joined the inmate Jaycee chapter and increased their membership figure from 50 to 650 in the span of less than 18 months. He is also known to have both secured an increase in the inmates' daily pay in the prison mess hall{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=88}} and to have supervised several projects to improve conditions for inmates at the prison.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=89}} On one occasion, Gacy oversaw the installation of a [[miniature golf]] course in the prison's recreation yard.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 62.</ref>\n\nIn June 1969, Gacy first applied to the State of Iowa Board of Parole for early release: this application was denied.

However, within 24 hours of his release, Gacy relocated to Chicago to live with his mother.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=276}} He arrived in Chicago on June 19 and shortly thereafter obtained a job as a [[short-order cook]] in a restaurant.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=49}}\n\nOn February 12, 1971, Gacy was charged with sexually assaulting a teenage boy.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=95}} The youth claimed that Gacy had lured him into his car at Chicago's [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound bus]] terminal and driven him to his home, where he had attempted to force the youth into sex. This complaint was subsequently dismissed when the youth failed to appear in court. The Iowa Board of Parole did not learn of this incident (which violated the conditions of his parole) and eight months later, in October 1971, Gacy's parole ended.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=96}} The following month, records of Gacy's previous criminal convictions in Iowa were subsequently [[Record sealing|sealed]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=53}}{{efn|Gacy successfully hid his [[criminal record]] from friends, business associates and political acquaintances; they only learned the truth of his past after police had begun investigating him for his later murders.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=72}}{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=73}}}}\n\n===8213 West Summerdale Avenue===\nWith financial assistance from his mother, Gacy bought a house in Norwood Park Township, an [[unincorporated area]] of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], a part of metropolitan Chicago. The address, 8213 West Summerdale Avenue, is where he resided until his arrest in December 1978 and where all his known murders were committed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=175}} He became active in his local community, and his neighbors considered him helpful; willing to loan his construction tools and plowing snow from neighborhood walks free of charge.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=86\u201387}} Between 1974 and 1978, he hosted annual summer parties attended by hundreds of people, including politicians.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=150}} \n\nIn August 1971, shortly after Gacy and his mother moved into the house, he became engaged to Carole Hoff, a [[divorcee]] with two young daughters. Hoff, whom he had briefly dated in high school, had been a friend of his younger sister. His fianc\u00e9e and stepdaughters moved into his home soon after the couple announced their engagement.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=55\u201359}} Gacy's mother subsequently moved out of the house shortly before his wedding, which was held on July 1, 1972.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=278}}\n\nOne week before Gacy's wedding, on June 22, he was arrested and charged with aggravated [[Sexual battery|battery]] and reckless conduct.

The business initially undertook minor repair work, such as sign-writing, pouring concrete, and redecorating, but later expanded to include projects such as interior design, [[remodeling]], installation, assembly, and [[landscaping]]. In mid-1973, Gacy quit his job as a cook in order that he could fully commit to his construction business.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=115}}\n\nMuch of the labor workforce consisted of high school students and young men.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=1}} In 1973, Gacy and a teenage employee of PDM Contractors traveled to [[Florida]] to view property Gacy had purchased. On the first night in Florida, Gacy raped the youth in their hotel room.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=118}} As a result, the youth refused to stay in the same hotel room as Gacy and instead slept on the beach. Upon returning to Chicago, he drove to Gacy's house and beat him in his yard. Gacy's mother-in-law stopped the assault and he drove away. Gacy explained to his wife that the attack happened because he had refused to pay the youth for poor quality painting work.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\nAnother employee of Gacy's was 15-year-old Anthony Antonucci, whom he had hired in May 1975. In July 1975, Gacy arrived at Antonucci's home while the youth was alone, having injured his foot at work the day prior. Gacy plied him with alcohol, wrestled him to the floor and cuffed his hands behind his back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} The cuff upon Antonucci's right wrist was loose: Antonucci freed his arm from the [[handcuffs|handcuff]] after Gacy left the room. When Gacy returned, Antonucci\u2014a member of his high school wrestling team\u2014pounced upon him. He wrestled Gacy to the floor, obtained possession of the handcuff key and cuffed Gacy's hands behind his back. Gacy screamed threats, then calmed down and promised to leave if Antonucci removed the handcuffs. The youth agreed and Gacy left the house.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} Antonucci later recalled that Gacy had told him as he lay prone on the floor: \"Not only are you the only one who got out of the cuffs; you got them on me.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=123}}\n\nBy 1975, PDM Contractors was expanding rapidly; by his own later admission, he began working 12- and 16-hour days to fulfill agreed commitments upon an increasing number of contracts.

This behavior included hearing his car arrive and depart in the early hours of the morning; noting lights switching on and off in his home at odd hours and his keeping company with young males.<ref name=\"autogenerated28\" /> One neighbor later recollected that, for several years, she and her son had repeatedly been awoken by the repeated sounds of muffled screaming, shouting, and crying in the early morning hours, which she and her son identified as emanating from a house adjacent to theirs on Summerdale Avenue.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=274}}\n\n===Modus operandi===\nGacy typically abducted his victims from Chicago's Greyhound Bus station, from [[Washington Square Park (Chicago)|Bughouse Square]], or simply off the streets.

In several instances, cloth gags stuffed into the victim's mouth caused Gacy's victim to die of asphyxiation as opposed to strangulation.<ref name=\"Kozenczak\" />\n\nAfter death, the victims' bodies were typically stored beneath his bed for up to 24 hours before Gacy buried his victim in the crawl space, where he periodically poured [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]] to hasten the decomposition of the bodies.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=177}} The bodies of some victims would be taken to his garage and [[embalming|embalmed]] prior to their burial.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=345}}\n\n===1976===\n[[File:CousinKevinscreenshot1980.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Victims Darrell Samson and Gregory Godzik.

While Gacy was within earshot of 15-year-old, part-time employee Robert Piest, he mentioned that his firm hired teenage boys at a starting wage of $5 per hour\u2014almost double the pay Piest earned at the pharmacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=5\u20136}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=4}}\n\nShortly after Gacy left the pharmacy, Piest informed his mother\u2014who had arrived at the pharmacy to drive her son home\u2014that \"some contractor wants to talk to me about a job\". Piest left the store, promising to return shortly.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=7}} Gacy murdered him at his house; he had been interrupted by a phone call from a business colleague while strangling him.\n\n==Investigation==\nWhen Piest failed to return, his family filed a [[missing person]] report on their son with the Des Plaines police. Torf named Gacy as the contractor Piest had most likely left the store to talk with about a job.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), pp. 25-26</ref> [[Joseph R. Kozenczak]] pursued the investigation. \n\nKozenczak and two other Des Plaines police officers visited Gacy at his home the following evening. Gacy indicated he had seen two youths working at the pharmacy and that he had asked one of them\u2014whom he believed to be Piest\u2014whether any remodeling materials were present in the rear of the store.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=19\u201321}} He was adamant, however, that he had not offered Piest a job and promised to come to the station later that evening to make a statement confirming this, indicating he was unable to do so at that moment as his uncle had just died. When the police still wanted to meet Gacy that evening, he responded: \"You guys are very rude. Don't you have any respect for the dead?\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=240}}\n\nAt 3:20&nbsp;a.m., Gacy, covered in mud, arrived at the police station, claiming he had been involved in a car accident.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=23}} Upon returning to the police station later that day, Gacy denied any involvement in the disappearance of Piest and repeated that he had not offered him a job. When asked why he had returned to the pharmacy at 8 p.m. Gacy claimed he had done so in response to a phone call from Torf informing him he had left his appointment book at the store. Detectives had already spoken with Torf, who had stated he had placed no such call to Gacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=27}} At the request of detectives, Gacy prepared a written statement detailing his movements on December 11.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=28}}\n\n===Revelations===\nDes Plaines police were convinced Gacy was behind Piest's disappearance and checked Gacy's record, discovering that he had an outstanding battery charge against him in Chicago and had served a prison sentence in Iowa for the sodomy of a 15-year-old boy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=17}} A search of Gacy's house on December 13 was ordered by a judge at the request of detectives and revealed several suspicious items. These included a [[syringe]], several police badges, and a 6mm Brevettata [[starter pistol]]. They also found handcuffs, books on homosexuality and [[pederasty]], a 39 inch long [[Dimensional lumber#Dimensional lumber|two-by-four]] with two holes drilled into each end,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=33}} several driver's licenses, a blue hooded parka and underwear too small to fit Gacy.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 61</ref>\n\nIn the northwest bedroom, investigators found a [[Maine West High School]] ring. This item initially interested investigators as Piest had attended Maine West, but the ring was not his. It was a class of 1975 ring engraved with the initials J.A.S.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=243}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=87}} A photo receipt from Nisson Pharmacy was also recovered from a trash can.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 61</ref>\n\nGacy's Oldsmobile and other PDM work vehicles were confiscated by the Des Plaines police, who assigned two two-man [[surveillance]] teams to monitor Gacy on a rotational twelve-hour basis as they continued their investigation into his background and potential involvement in Piest's disappearance.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Murder casebook number 84 {{ISBN|0-7485-1454-6}}, p. 1915</ref> These surveillance teams consisted of officers Mike Albrecht and David Hachmeister, and Ronald Robinson and Robert Schultz. {{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=41}}\n\nThe following day, investigators received a phone call from Michael Rossi, who informed the investigators both of Gregory Godzik's disappearance{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=53}} and the fact that another PDM employee, Charles Hattula, had been found drowned in an Illinois river the previous year.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=123}}\n\nOn December 15, Des Plaines investigators obtained further details upon Gacy's battery charge, learning the complainant, Jeffrey Rignall, had reported that Gacy had lured him into his car, chloroformed him, raped him and dumped him, with severe chest and facial burns and rectal bleeding, in Lincoln Park the following morning. In an interview with Gacy's former wife the same day, they learned of the disappearance of John Butkovich.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=84}} The same day, the Maine West High School ring was traced to a John Alan Szyc.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=53\u201355}} In an interview with Szyc's mother the same day, she informed officers of the January 1977 disappearance of her son and that several items from his apartment were also missing, including a Motorola TV set.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 117</ref>\n\nBy December 16, Gacy was becoming affable with the surveillance detectives, regularly inviting them to join him for meals in restaurants and occasionally for drinks in bars or within his home. He repeatedly denied that he had anything to do with Piest's disappearance and accused the officers of harassing him because of his political connections or because of his recreational drug use. Knowing these officers were unlikely to arrest him on anything trivial, he openly taunted them by flouting traffic laws and succeeded in losing his pursuers on more than one occasion.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=89}}\n\nOn December 17, investigators conducted a formal interview of Michael Rossi, who informed them Gacy had sold Szyc's vehicle to him with the explanation that he had bought the car from Szyc because the youth needed money to move to California. A further examination of Gacy's Oldsmobile was conducted on this date. In the course of examining the trunk of the car, the investigators discovered a small cluster of fibers which may have been human hair. These fibers were sent for further analysis. That evening, officers conducted a test using three trained [[German shepherd]] [[Search and rescue dog|search dogs]] to determine whether Piest had been present in any of Gacy's vehicles.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}} The dogs were allowed to examine each of Gacy's vehicles, whereupon one dog approached Gacy's Oldsmobile and lay upon the passenger seat in what the dog's handler informed investigators was a \"death reaction\", indicating the body of Robert Piest had been present in this vehicle.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}}\n\nThat evening, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives to a restaurant for a meal. In the early hours of December 18, he invited the same officers into another restaurant where, over breakfast, he talked of his business, his marriages and his activities as a registered clown. At one point during this conversation, Gacy remarked to one of the two surveillance detectives: \"You know\u2026 clowns can get away with murder.\"{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=226}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=90}}\n\n===Civil suit===\nBy December 18, Gacy was beginning to show visible signs of strain as a result of the constant surveillance: he was unshaven, looked tired, appeared anxious and was drinking heavily. That afternoon, he drove to his lawyers' office to prepare a $750,000 [[civil suit]] against the Des Plaines police,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=102}} demanding that they cease their surveillance. The same day, the serial number of the Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt found in Gacy's kitchen was traced to 17-year-old Kim Byers, a colleague of Piest at Nisson Pharmacy, who admitted when contacted in person the following day that she had worn the jacket and had placed the receipt in the [[Anorak|parka]] pocket just before she gave the parka to Piest as he left the store to talk with a contractor.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=110}} This revelation contradicted Gacy's previous statements that he had had no contact with Robert Piest on the evening of December 11.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\nThe same evening, Michael Rossi was interviewed a second time: on this occasion, Rossi was more cooperative, informing detectives that in the summer of 1977, Gacy had had him spread ten bags of [[Lime (material)|lime]] in the crawl space of the house.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}}\n\nOn December 19, investigators began compiling evidence for a second search warrant of Gacy's house. The same day, Gacy's lawyers filed the civil suit against the Des Plaines police. The hearing of the suit was scheduled for December 22. That afternoon, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives inside his house. On this occasion, as one officer distracted Gacy with conversation, another officer walked into Gacy's bedroom in an unsuccessful attempt to write down the serial number of the Motorola TV set they suspected belonged to John Szyc. While flushing Gacy's toilet, this officer noticed a smell he suspected could be that of rotting corpses emanating from a [[heating duct]]; the officers who previously searched Gacy's house had failed to notice this, as on that occasion the house had been cold.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nBoth David Cram and Michael Rossi were interviewed by investigators on December 20. Rossi had agreed to be interviewed in relation to his possible links with John Szyc as well as the disappearance of Robert Piest. When questioned by Detective [[Joseph R. Kozenczak]] as to where he believed Gacy had placed Piest's body, Rossi replied: \"In the crawl space; he could have put him in the crawl space.\"<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 147</ref> A polygraph test showed his responses to questions to be inconclusive; however, upon his agreeing to a subsequent visual test in which a map of Cook County was divided into 12 [[Grid plan|grid sections]] numbered 1 to 12, with Gacy's home marked in the fourth grid section, Kozenczak noted an extreme response in Rossi's [[blood pressure]] when asked: \"Is the body of Robert Piest buried in grid number 4?\"<ref>Kozenczak, Joseph R.; Kozenczak, Karen M.

CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform. {{ISBN|978-1401095314}} p. 148</ref> Upon hearing this question, Rossi refused to continue the polygraph questioning, although he did discuss further his digging trenches in the crawl space and remarked upon Gacy's insistence that he not deviate from where he was instructed to dig.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=181}}\n\nCram himself informed investigators of Gacy's attempts to rape him in 1976 and stated that after he and Gacy had returned to his home after the December 13 search of his property, Gacy had turned pale upon noting a clot of mud on his carpet which he suspected had come from his crawl space. Cram then stated Gacy had grabbed a flashlight and immediately entered the crawl space to look for evidence of digging. When asked whether he had been to the crawl space, Cram replied he had been asked by Gacy to spread lime down there and also dug trenches upon Gacy's behest with the explanation they were for plumbing.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}} Cram stated these trenches were {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} wide, {{convert|6|ft|m|sp=us}} long and {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} deep\u2014the size of graves.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=143\u2013145}}\n\n===Verbal confession===\nOn the evening of December 20, Gacy drove to his lawyers' office in [[Park Ridge, Illinois|Park Ridge]] to attend a pre-scheduled meeting he had arranged with them, ostensibly to discuss the progress of his civil suit. Upon his arrival, Gacy appeared disheveled and immediately asked for an alcoholic drink, whereupon Sam Amirante fetched a bottle of whiskey from his car. Upon his return, Amirante asked Gacy what he had to discuss with them. Gacy picked up a copy of the ''[[Chicago Daily Herald|Daily Herald]]'' from Amirante's desk; he pointed to a front-page article covering the disappearance of Robert Piest and informed his lawyers: \"This boy is dead. He's in a river.\"{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=136}}\n\nOver the following hours, Gacy gave a rambling confession that ran into the early hours of the following morning. He began by informing Amirante and Stevens he had \"been the judge ... jury and executioner of many, many people\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 127</ref> most of whom he stated were buried in his crawl space, and others in the Des Plaines River. Some victims he referred to by name; most he dismissed as \"[[Male prostitution|male prostitutes]]\", \"hustlers\" and \"liars\" to whom he gave \"the rope trick\". On other occasions, he stated he woke up to find \"dead, strangled kids\" on his floor, with their hands cuffed behind their back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=171}} In reference to Robert Piest, Gacy stated that as he placed the tourniquet around his neck, that Piest was \"crying, scared\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 140</ref>\n\nAs a result of the alcohol he had consumed, Gacy fell asleep midway through his confession and Amirante immediately arranged a psychiatric appointment for Gacy at 9 a.m. that morning. Upon awakening several hours later, Gacy simply shook his head when informed by Amirante he had earlier confessed to killing approximately 30 people, stating: \"Well, I can't think about this right now. I've got things to do.\"<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\">Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150</ref> Ignoring his lawyers' advice regarding his scheduled appointment, Gacy left their office to attend to the needs of his business.<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\" />\n\nGacy later recollected his memories of his final day of freedom as being \"hazy\", adding that he knew his arrest was inevitable and that, in his final hours of freedom, he intended to visit his friends and say his final farewells.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=255\u2013258}} Upon leaving his lawyers' office, Gacy drove to a Shell gas station where, in the course of filling his rental car, he handed a small bag of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to the attendant, Lance Jacobson. Jacobson immediately handed the bag to the surveillance officers, adding that Gacy had told him: \"The end is coming (for me). These guys are going to kill me.\" Gacy then drove to the home of a fellow contractor, Ronald Rhode. Inside Rhode's living room, Gacy hugged Rhode before bursting into tears and saying: \"I killed thirty people, give or take a few.\" Gacy then left Rhode's home to meet with Michael Rossi and David Cram. As he drove along the expressway, the surveillance officers noted he was holding a [[Catholic rosary|rosary]] to his chin as he prayed while driving.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=152}}\n\nAfter talking with Cram and Rossi at Cram's home, Gacy had Cram drive him to a scheduled meeting with Leroy Stevens. As he spoke with his lawyer, Cram informed the officers that Gacy had earlier divulged to both himself and Rossi that the previous evening, he had confessed to his lawyers his guilt in over thirty murders. Upon concluding his meeting with his lawyer, Gacy had Cram drive him to Maryhill Cemetery, where his father was buried.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=259}}\n\nAs Gacy drove to various locations that morning, police outlined their formal draft of their second search warrant. The purpose of the warrant was specifically to search for the body of Robert Piest in the crawl space. Upon hearing radioed reports from the surveillance detectives that, in light of his erratic behavior, Gacy might be about to commit suicide, police decided to arrest him upon a charge of possession and distribution of marijuana{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=157}} in order to hold him in custody as the formal request for a second search warrant was presented. At 4:30 on the afternoon of December 21, the eve of the hearing of Gacy's civil suit, the request for a second search warrant was granted by Judge Marvin J. Peters.<ref>Kozenczak, (2012) p. 158</ref>\n\nArmed with the signed search warrant, police and evidence technicians quickly drove to Gacy's home. Upon their arrival, officers found that Gacy had unplugged his [[sump pump]] and that the crawl space was flooded with water; to clear the water they simply replaced the plug and waited for the water to drain. After it had done so, evidence technician Daniel Genty entered the {{convert|28|x|38|ft|adj=on}} crawl space,<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 50.</ref> crawled to the southwest area, and began digging. Within minutes, he had uncovered [[putrefaction|putrefied]] flesh and a human arm bone. Genty immediately shouted to the investigators that they could charge Gacy with murder.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}} Genty added the remark: \"I think this place is full of kids.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}}\n\n==Arrest and confession==\nAfter being informed that the police had found human remains in his crawl space and that he would now face murder charges, Gacy told officers he wanted to \"clear the air\",{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} adding that he knew his arrest was inevitable since he had spent the previous evening on the couch in his lawyers' office.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=170}}\n\nIn the early hours of December 22, 1978, Gacy confessed to police that since 1972, he had committed 25 to 30 murders, all of whom he falsely claimed were of teenage male [[Runaway (dependent)|runaway]]s or male prostitutes.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=174}} When asked where he drew the inspiration for the two-by-four attached with manacles at either end found at his house, Gacy stated he had been inspired to construct the device from reading about the [[Dean Corll|Houston Mass Murders]].{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=197}}{{efn|The Houston Mass Murders were a series of killings uncovered in 1973 in which Dean Corll, with two teenaged accomplices, had also used a wooden device (in their case a board fitted with handcuffs at each corner) to restrain their male victims throughout their sexual abuse and torture.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Man with the Candy: The Story of the Houston Mass Murders|last = Olsen|first = Jack|publisher = Simon and Schuster|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-439-12870-1 |page = 146}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = How to Make a Serial Killer: The Twisted Development of Innocent Children Into the World's Most Sadistic Murderers|last = Berry-Dee|first = Christopher|publisher = Ulysses Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-569-75943-1|location = |page = 202}}</ref> Gacy was likely inspired by press coverage relating to the Houston Mass Murders to construct this device to restrain his victims, and to dupe his victim into donning handcuffs, as several victims of the Houston Mass Murders had been.{{sfn|Berry-Dee|2009|p=138}}}} In January 1979, he had planned to further conceal the corpses by covering the entire crawl space with concrete.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=222}} \n\nWhen specifically questioned about Piest, Gacy confessed to strangling him at his house on the evening of December 11 after luring him there.

Those doctors refuted the defense doctors' claims of multiple personality and insanity. Cram and Rossi both confessed that Gacy had made them dig trenches in his crawl space. Cram testified that in August 1977, Gacy had marked a location in the crawl space with sticks and told him to dig a [[Drainage#Drainage in construction|drainage]] trench.<ref name=\"The Montreal Gazette Feb. 13, 1980\" />{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=181}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=311}}\n\nImmediately after Cram had completed his testimony, Rossi testified for the state. When asked where he had dug in the crawl space, Rossi turned to a diagram of Gacy's home on display in the courtroom. This diagram showed where the bodies were found in the crawl space and elsewhere on the property. Rossi pointed to the location of the remains of an unidentified victim known as \"Body 13\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=311}} Rossi stated he had not dug any other trenches, but\u2014at Gacy's request\u2014had supervised other PDM employees digging trenches in the crawl space.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=181}}\n\nBoth Rossi and Cram also testified that Gacy periodically looked into the crawl space to ensure they and other employees ordered to dig trenches in the crawl space did not deviate from the precise locations he had marked.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=312}} Gacy had testified after his arrest that he had only dug five of the victims' graves in his crawl space{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=142}} and had his employees (including Gregory Godzik) dig the remaining trenches so that he would \"have graves available\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=360}}\n\nOn February 18, Dr. Robert Stein,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=321}} the Cook County medical examiner appointed to supervise the exhumation of the victims' bodies from Gacy's home, testified as to how he and his colleagues had conducted the recovery of the remains.

Rignall repeatedly wept as he recounted his ordeal. In response to questioning relating to whether Gacy appreciated the criminality of his actions, Rignall stated his belief that Gacy was unable to conform his actions to the conduct of law because of the \"beastly and animalistic ways he attacked me\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 290</ref> Upon specific cross-examination relating to the torture he had endured, Rignall vomited before he was excused from further testimony.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=300}}\n\nOn February 29, Donald Voorhees, whom Gacy had sexually assaulted in 1967, testified to his ordeal at Gacy's hands, and that Gacy had subsequently paid another youth to beat him and spray Mace in his face so he would not testify against him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}} Voorhees felt unable to testify, but did briefly attempt to do so, before being asked to step down.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}}\n\nRobert Donnelly testified the week after Voorhees, recounting his ordeal at Gacy's hands in December 1977. Donnelly was visibly distressed as he recollected the abuse he endured at Gacy's hands and came close to breaking down on several occasions. As Donnelly testified, Gacy repeatedly laughed at him,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=333}} but Donnelly finished his testimony. One of Gacy's defense attorneys, Robert Motta, during Donnelly's cross-examination, attempted to discredit his testimony, but Donnelly did not waver from his testimony of what had occurred.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=345}}\n\nDuring the fifth week of the trial, Gacy wrote a personal letter to Judge Garippo requesting a [[mistrial]]{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=342}} on a number of bases, including that he did not approve his lawyers' insanity plea approach; that his lawyers had not allowed him to take the witness stand (as he had desired to do); that his defense had not called enough witnesses, and that the police were lying about statements he had purportedly made to detectives after his arrest and that, in any event, the statements were \"self-serving\" for use by the prosecution.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=350\u2013351}} Judge Garippo addressed Gacy's letter by informing him that under the law he had the choice as to whether he wished to testify, and he was free to indicate as much to the judge if he wished to do so.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=312}}\n\n===Closing arguments===\nOn March 11, final arguments from both prosecution and defense attorneys began, with the arguments concluding on the following day. Prosecuting attorney Terry Sullivan argued first, outlining Gacy's history of abusing youths, the testimony of his efforts to avoid detection and describing Gacy's surviving victims\u2014Voorhees and Donnelly\u2014as \"living dead\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}} Referring to Gacy as the \"worst of all murderers\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 324</ref> Sullivan stated: \"John Gacy has accounted for more human devastation than many earthly catastrophes, but one must tremble. I tremble when thinking about just how close he came to getting away with it all.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}}\n\nAfter the state's four-hour closing, counsel Sam Amirante argued for the defense. Amirante argued against the testimony delivered by the doctors who had testified for the prosecution, repeatedly citing the testimony of the four psychiatrists and psychologists who had testified on behalf of the defense.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=360}} Amirante also accused Sullivan of scarcely referring to the evidence presented throughout the trial in his own closing argument, and of arousing hatred against his client. The defense lawyer attempted to portray Gacy as a \"man driven by compulsions he was unable to control\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=363}}\n\nIn support of these arguments, the defense counsel repeatedly referred to the testimony of the doctors who had appeared for the defense, in addition to the testimony of defense witnesses such as Jeffrey Rignall and Gacy's former business associate Mickel Reed\u2014both of whom had testified to their belief that Gacy had been unable to control his actions.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=359}} Amirante then urged the jury to put aside any prejudice they held against his client, and requested they deliver a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, adding that the psychology of Gacy's behavior would be of benefit to scientific research and that the psychology of his mind should be studied.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=361}}\n\n[[File:Kunkletrial.jpg|200px|thumb|William Kunkle, prosecutor at Gacy's trial, standing before a board depicting the 22 victims identified by February 1980.]]\nOn the morning of March 12,{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=364}} William Kunkle continued to argue for the prosecution. Kunkle referred to the defense's contention of insanity as \"a [[falsity|sham]]\", arguing that the facts of the case demonstrated Gacy's ability to think logically and control his actions. Kunkle also referred to the testimony of a doctor who had examined Gacy in 1968. This doctor had diagnosed Gacy as an [[antisocial personality]], capable of committing crimes without remorse. Kunkle indicated that had the recommendations of this doctor been heeded, Gacy would have not been freed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}}\n\nAt the close of his argument, Kunkle pulled each of the 22 photos of Gacy's identified victims off a board displaying the images and asked the jury not to show sympathy but to \"show justice\". Kunkle then asked the jury to \"show the same sympathy this man showed when he took these lives and put them ''there!''{{-\"}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}} before throwing the stack of photos into the opening of the trap door of Gacy's crawl space, which had been introduced as evidence and was on display in the courtroom.

Amirante has since stated that the primary inspiration for this legislation was the fact that at the time of the Gacy murders, there had been a 72-hour period which police in Illinois had to allow to elapse before initiating a search for a missing child or adolescent.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\nThe Illinois Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984 removed this 72-hour waiting period. Other states across America subsequently adopted similar procedures and sensibilities, as a result of which a national network aimed at locating missing children was gradually formed. This national network has since developed into the Child Abduction Emergency\u2014commonly known today as an [[Amber Alert]].{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\n==Potential accomplices and connections==\nOne of the first things Gacy told investigators after his arrest was that he had not acted alone in several of the murders: he asked whether \"my associates\" had also been arrested.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} When questioned as to whether these associates had participated directly or indirectly in the killings, Gacy replied, \"Directly.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}}\n\nGacy specifically named Cram and Rossi as being involved in several of the murders.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} In the 1980s, he also informed [[Robert Ressler]] that \"two or three\" PDM employees had assisted him in several murders.<ref>Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} pp 341\u2013342</ref> Ressler replied that he believed there were unexplained avenues to the case and stated his belief that Gacy had killed more than 33 victims. Gacy neither confirmed nor denied Ressler's suspicions.{{efn|Gacy is known to have given Ressler a painting with a written inscription reading: \"Dear Bob Ressler, You cannot hope to enjoy the harvest, without first laboring in the fields\".<ref>Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} p 343</ref>}}\n\nJeffrey Rignall, who had been assaulted and tortured by Gacy in March 1978, was adamant that at one point during his abuse and torture, a young man with brown hair, kneeling before him, watched his abuse.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=209}} When this youth realized Rignall had regained consciousness, he was again chloroformed into unconsciousness. Rignall also informed police that as Gacy was raping and assaulting him, a light was switched on in another part of the house.<ref name=\"google2963\">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat=19790101&id=PEEsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=v80EAAAAIBAJ&pg=2963,232748|title=Herald-Journal \u2013 Google News Archive Search|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, on one occasion during the surveillance of Gacy prior to his arrest, two of the surveillance officers followed Gacy to a bar to which Gacy had driven to meet two of his employees. At the bar, the surveillance officers overheard a hushed conversation between Gacy and one of his employees in which the youth asked Gacy the question: \"And what? Buried like the other five?\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=102}}\n\nIn interviews following his arrest and conviction, Gacy repeatedly claimed that he was not present in Chicago when 16 of the identified victims had disappeared. In one interview, he stated that at the time of his arrest, four PDM employees were also considered suspects in the disappearances of the missing boys investigators had linked to Gacy\u2014all of whom he stated were in possession of keys to his house.<ref>Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} pp=341\u2013342</ref> One of these employees was Philip Paske, a young man who is known to have been a close associate of John Norman.

To Nelson's family, Young had stated Nelson failed to arrive at a bar at a prearranged time; to investigators, Young claimed he had last seen Nelson standing among a crowd who had gathered outside a Chicago bar and when his attention was diverted for a few moments, Nelson simply disappeared.

Ernesti was professor of poetry at [[Leipzig University]] and director of the [[Thomasschule]]. The first performance took place in the [[Paulinerkirche, Leipzig|Paulinerkirche]], the university church). Scholars debate if the performance was 24 October, or rather 21 October, as indicated by the title page of the sermon.<ref name=\"petzold\" />\n\nBach wrote a number of works for occasions of Leipzig University.

It also features guest vocals from Lil Jon and Ludacris, with the former also producing the song as well as incorporating [[crunk]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]\u2014which he coined as [[crunk&B]]\u2014in the song's production. The song was released as the [[lead single]] from Usher's fourth studio album ''[[Confessions (Usher album)|Confessions]]'' (2004) on January 27, 2004, after Usher was told by [[Arista Records]], his label at the time, to record more tracks for the album.\n\n\"Yeah!\" topped the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for 12 consecutive weeks, before being dethroned by Usher's follow-up single \"[[Burn (Usher song)|Burn]]\". \"Yeah!\" was the longest-running number one single in 2004,<ref>[[List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 2004]]</ref> subsequently topping the year-end chart on the Hot 100.<ref>{{cite web |title=Top 100 Songs of 2004 - Billboard Year End Charts |url=http://www.bobborst.com/popculture/top-100-songs-of-the-year/?year=2004 |website=Bobborst |accessdate=22 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109225505/http://www.bobborst.com/popculture/top-100-songs-of-the-year/?year=2004 |archive-date=November 9, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The song received a similar response in other countries, topping in other twelve charts worldwide. It was certified platinum in several countries, including [[Australian Recording Industry Association|Australia]], [[Ultratop 50|Belgium]], [[Canadian Hot 100|Canada]], [[Media Control Charts|Germany]] and [[VG-lista|Norway]], and received a two times platinum certification in [[Recording Industry Association of New Zealand|New Zealand]]. The song peaked in the top-ten in several Year-end charts.\n\nAn accompanying music video, directed by [[Director X|Mr. X]], shows Usher, Ludacris and Lil Jon performing choreography in a club in front of blue laser beams. \"Yeah!\" won a [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration|Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]] at the [[47th Grammy Awards]], while being nominated for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]]. The song ranked second on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 2000\u20132009 Decade-end chart. As of September 2013, the song has sold over 4 million copies in the US.\n\n==Background and release==\nIn the fall of 2003, Usher submitted his fourth studio album, ''[[Confessions (Usher album)|Confessions]]'' (2004), to his record label [[Arista Records]]. However, when the singer and the company's then-president [[L.A. Reid]] listened to the songs, Reid felt the album lacked a song that had the potential to be released as the album's [[lead single]]. In light of this, Usher was told to record a few more tracks, and so he enlisted American rapper-producer [[Lil Jon]] to aid in musical production.<ref name=\"ReidShook\">{{Cite news |last=Reid |first=Shaheem |title=The Road To Confessions: How Usher 'Shook A Million' |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1486094/20040331/usher.jhtml |publisher=[[MTV News]]. [[Viacom Media Networks]]|date=March 31, 2004 |accessdate=March 2, 2008}}</ref> Lil Jon recalled, \"He [Usher] needed a single. They had 'Burn', 'Burn' was hot, but they needed that first powerful monster.

The rapper would only select two tracks, which provided Lil Jon the opportunity to give leftover songs to other record labels. Without Lil Jon's knowledge, Jive Records gave one of the leftover tracks to [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artist [[Petey Pablo]] which would eventually become \"[[Freak-a-Leek]]\". However, Lil Jon, assuming that the song had not been used, gave the production to Usher, resulting in a rough version of \"Yeah!\". Eventually realizing the mistake after Pablo played \"Freek-a-leek\" to Lil Jon, the latter insisted on producing more tracks for Pablo; however, Pablo did not give up the song, due to the fact that it was already recorded and had been getting responses from Southern radio.

Viacom Media Networks|date=August 24, 2004 |accessdate=March 5, 2008}}</ref> Usher and Mr. X combined ideas to create a dance video for \"Yeah!\". The development was handled by how Usher wanted to be portrayed in the video, particularly showcasing his dance moves. The music video was filmed in a vacant art gallery in Los Angeles over two days. When the shooting started, Mr. X recalled [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"low-tech\" and \"laser-flashing\" 1979 \"[[Rock with You]]\" video, and used it as a reference.<ref name=\"Gil\"/> Forty extra people were commissioned to dance with Usher, and two ladies to tempt him in different scenes. They went through photo browsing and phone calling, opting for [[Destiny Lightsy]], a friend of Mr. X, who seduces Usher in the club in a [[Marilyn Monroe]] wardrobe to complement the lyrics.<ref name=\"Gil\"/> Canadian model [[Melyssa Ford]], who was discovered by Mr. X, is portrayed as Usher's second seductress.<ref name=\"Gil\"/> Lil Jon acted as an assistant director during the sessions. Usher took charge of his ideas on his wardrobe and choreography, with additional routines, specifically the Rockaway and the Thunderclap, which Mr. X learned from Jamaica. The Rockaway influenced Fat Joe and Terror Squad's \"[[Lean Back]]\" video.<ref name=\"Gil\"/>\n\n===Synopsis and reception===\n[[File:LittleXFeb07.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|Canadian director [[Little X|Mr. X]] directed the video for \"Yeah!\"]]\nThe video begins with Usher entering a club, and in another scene dancing in front of blue lasers; the video alternates between both the club and laser scenes throughout. In the former setting, Usher is sat down when a woman\u2014portrayed by Destiny, video producer Mr. X's friend\u2014approaches him and attempts to seduce him. The woman stands up and walks to the dance-floor, telling Usher to \"come get me\" and \"baby let's go\", in sync with the song. Usher goes and dances with her during the chorus. In the beginning of the second verse, the laser scene with Usher dancing now shows both blue and green lasers. Usher and the woman are still dancing, with the woman further attempting to seduce him.\n\nIn the second chorus, Usher performs choreography in the club, backed up by several male dancers. Female dancers then come in, performing choreography along with Usher and the male dancers. After Lil Jon sprays champagne towards the camera in the laser scene, Ludacris performs his verse. He is dancing in both the club and laser scene, with the camera also alternating to female's dancing in sync in the club.\n\nIn the final chorus, Usher again performs choreography in the club, with another scene in the latter setting this time showing a different seductress, portrayed by model Melyssa Ford, walking away telling him to follow her. While following her, he is in a hallway, with the women then pulling Usher in a room, where they begin to romance. While Ludacris says his final verse, rapper [[Chingy]] and [[Sean Combs|P.

However, when the singer and the company's then-president [[L.A. Reid]] listened to the songs, Reid felt the album lacked a song that had the potential to be released as the album's [[lead single]]. In light of this, Usher was told to record a few more tracks, and so he enlisted American rapper-producer [[Lil Jon]] to aid in musical production.<ref name=\"ReidShook\">{{Cite news |last=Reid |first=Shaheem |title=The Road To Confessions: How Usher 'Shook A Million' |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1486094/20040331/usher.jhtml |publisher=[[MTV News]].

The rapper would only select two tracks, which provided Lil Jon the opportunity to give leftover songs to other record labels. Without Lil Jon's knowledge, Jive Records gave one of the leftover tracks to [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artist [[Petey Pablo]] which would eventually become \"[[Freak-a-Leek]]\". However, Lil Jon, assuming that the song had not been used, gave the production to Usher, resulting in a rough version of \"Yeah!\". Eventually realizing the mistake after Pablo played \"Freek-a-leek\" to Lil Jon, the latter insisted on producing more tracks for Pablo; however, Pablo did not give up the song, due to the fact that it was already recorded and had been getting responses from Southern radio. Lil Jon commented, \"With so much invested, Jive wouldn't give up the cut.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,634074,00.html|title=''Yeah'', Lil Jon came through again |last=Drumming|first= Neil|date=May 14, 2004|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]| publisher=[[Time Warner]]|accessdate= November 23, 2008}}</ref> Lil Jon jumped back in the studio and created an equally catchy replacement track.<ref name=\"ReidKingMe\"/> Though \"Yeah!\" was now completed, the label still had \"Burn\" on queue for the lead single.

Mr. X said that the song reminded him of laser beams.<ref name=\"Gil\">{{Cite news |last=Kaufman |first=Gil |title=Usher's 'Yeah!'

Viacom Media Networks|date=August 24, 2004 |accessdate=March 5, 2008}}</ref> Usher and Mr. X combined ideas to create a dance video for \"Yeah!\". The development was handled by how Usher wanted to be portrayed in the video, particularly showcasing his dance moves. The music video was filmed in a vacant art gallery in Los Angeles over two days. When the shooting started, Mr. X recalled [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"low-tech\" and \"laser-flashing\" 1979 \"[[Rock with You]]\" video, and used it as a reference.<ref name=\"Gil\"/> Forty extra people were commissioned to dance with Usher, and two ladies to tempt him in different scenes. They went through photo browsing and phone calling, opting for [[Destiny Lightsy]], a friend of Mr. X, who seduces Usher in the club in a [[Marilyn Monroe]] wardrobe to complement the lyrics.<ref name=\"Gil\"/> Canadian model [[Melyssa Ford]], who was discovered by Mr. X, is portrayed as Usher's second seductress.<ref name=\"Gil\"/> Lil Jon acted as an assistant director during the sessions. Usher took charge of his ideas on his wardrobe and choreography, with additional routines, specifically the Rockaway and the Thunderclap, which Mr. X learned from Jamaica. The Rockaway influenced Fat Joe and Terror Squad's \"[[Lean Back]]\" video.<ref name=\"Gil\"/>\n\n===Synopsis and reception===\n[[File:LittleXFeb07.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|Canadian director [[Little X|Mr. X]] directed the video for \"Yeah!\"]]\nThe video begins with Usher entering a club, and in another scene dancing in front of blue lasers; the video alternates between both the club and laser scenes throughout. In the former setting, Usher is sat down when a woman\u2014portrayed by Destiny, video producer Mr. X's friend\u2014approaches him and attempts to seduce him. The woman stands up and walks to the dance-floor, telling Usher to \"come get me\" and \"baby let's go\", in sync with the song. Usher goes and dances with her during the chorus. In the beginning of the second verse, the laser scene with Usher dancing now shows both blue and green lasers. Usher and the woman are still dancing, with the woman further attempting to seduce him.\n\nIn the second chorus, Usher performs choreography in the club, backed up by several male dancers. Female dancers then come in, performing choreography along with Usher and the male dancers. After Lil Jon sprays champagne towards the camera in the laser scene, Ludacris performs his verse. He is dancing in both the club and laser scene, with the camera also alternating to female's dancing in sync in the club.\n\nIn the final chorus, Usher again performs choreography in the club, with another scene in the latter setting this time showing a different seductress, portrayed by model Melyssa Ford, walking away telling him to follow her. While following her, he is in a hallway, with the women then pulling Usher in a room, where they begin to romance. While Ludacris says his final verse, rapper [[Chingy]] and [[Sean Combs|P. Diddy]]'s former assistant, [[Fonzworth Bentley]], both make appearances with Bentley holding a violin. Lil Jon says his final verse, not present in the track version of \"Yeah!\", where he repeats numerous dance moves including the Rockaway and Thunderclap, with Usher performing them. The video ends with Lil Jon repeating \"rock away\" and then \"cut\".<ref name=\"ReidShook\"/>\n\nAt the 2004 [[MTV Video Music Awards]], Usher won his first 2 awards with [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Dance Video|Best Dance Video]] and [[Best Male Video]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/66688/2004-mtv-video-music-awards-winners |title=2004 MTV Video Music Awards Winners |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=August 13, 2016}}</ref> At the 2005 [[Soul Train Music Award]]s, the video was nominated for the [[Michael Jackson]] Award for Best R&B/Soul or Rap Music Video.<ref name=\"STA\"/>\n\n==Popular culture==\nThe song has been featured in the films ''[[Hitch (film)|Hitch]], [[The Hangover]],'' and ''[[The Interview]]'' as well as the television shows ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' and ''[[Getaway (TV series)|Getaway]].''

When reached to comment on the issue, a spokesperson for YouTube later commented saying that videos can be taken down by mistake but a review is taken to take \"appropriate action\", which include restoring videos that were previously removed. However, there could be another reason why it was taken down, which is because of its sexualized portrayal of Cabello and Jane, who were [[underage]]{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=February 2019}} when the video was filmed.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=John|title=Here's why Fifth Harmony's 'Worth It' video was removed from YouTube|url=http://fusion.kinja.com/heres-why-fifth-harmonys-worth-it-video-was-removed-fro-1793849391|website=Fusion|access-date=June 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Synopsis===\nThe video begins with shots of the skyline of [[Hong Kong]], where most of the setting takes place. An image of a stock market appears, zooming in on what appears to say, \"@FifthHarmony [[Women in positions of power|women in power]]\". The girls then appear in silhouettes and begin walking confidently as men stand next to a wall, appearing to stand in attention to the ladies. Individual shots of every girl are shown, giggling and smiling at the camera, before switching back to the stock market background. The group perform a choreographed dance move, and a [[Newton's cradle]] is shown being used, in rhythm to the song. The words \"break through the [[glass ceiling]]\" appear in stock market background, a reference to the obstacles that minorities, particularly minority women, have when climbing the corporate ladder.\n[[File:Fifth Harmony - Worth It ft. Kid Ink Music Video.png|thumb|250px|right|alt=|The members of [[Fifth Harmony]] dress in business-esque attire, demonstrating themes of [[feminism]] and [[Self-esteem|self-worth]].]]\nThe verse changes to Kid Ink, who is dressed in almost all-black clothing. He appears to be sitting in an office room with two attractive women approaching him as he sings. The women are dressed in business attire and are shown to have green eyes, known as a symbol for greed and/or jealousy. A man is shown cleaning Dinah's shoe, as she controls him. She then kicks him to show she is not controlled by anyone. The scene shifts to Normani, who is sporting a fashionable business outfit with a white blazer. She then dramatically stands up from her chair, while a man, who appears to be her accountant, looks at her in a frightened motion. Just like the women sitting next to Kid Ink, he also appears to have green eyes. All members perform a dance move, when the setting shifts to Camila getting ready to play golf in her office. Ally is then shown with a man who also appears to be her accountant, similar to Normani. Lauren is seen in the back of a convertible black car with a man in the driver's seat. Each girl either flicks the man next to them or kicks them in frustration.\n\nThe ladies are now in the stock market background, telling their lover that they're \"Worth It\". They also seem to rush their accountants, who are continuously typing on their calculators. The words ''\"[[feminism]] is sexy\"'' appear in the stock market background, before switching to Kid Ink, where the women move in-sync to the rhythm as he raps. The camera zooms into the eyes of a woman, with her eyes appearing bright green. The group perform more choreographed dance moves individually and as a group. Shots of all the members winking their eye, smiling, and showing confidence are shown. The video ends with the group facing away from the camera and looking at the stock market behind them, then turn around and move their hands upward, a similar ending to the group's past videos.\n\n==Live performances==\nFifth Harmony performed \"Worth It\" live for the first time on [[VH1]]'s ''[[Big Morning Buzz Live]]'' on February 17, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stern|first1=Bradley|title=Fifth Harmony Perform \"Worth It\" Live For The First Time: Watch|url=http://www.idolator.com/7581536/fifth-harmony-performance-worth-it-live-watch|publisher=Idolator|accessdate=February 20, 2015}}</ref> They performed the song on ''[[Live! with Kelly and Michael]]'' on April 13,<ref>{{cite web|title=Fifth Harmony Perform \"Worth It\" On \u2018Live With Kelly & Michael': Watch {{!}} Idolator|url=http://www.idolator.com/7588702/fifth-harmony-worth-it-live-kelly-michael-watch|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref> as well as on the [[Radio Disney Music Awards]] which aired on April 26, 2015.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://hollywoodlife.com/2015/04/27/fifth-harmony-performance-radio-disney-music-awards-2015-worth-it-video/|title=Fifth Harmony Rocks \u2018Worth It\u2019 At Radio Disney Music Awards \u2014 Watch|last=Wilson|first=Samantha|date=April 27, 2015|work=Hollywood Life|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref> The song was also performed on the finale of ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'' on May 19, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latintimes.com/pulse/watch-fifth-harmony-dancing-stars-finale-performance-totally-worth-it-video-317819|title=Watch Fifth Harmony 'Dancing With The Stars' Finale Performance Totally 'Worth It' [VIDEO]|accessdate=June 6, 2015}}</ref> Outside of the United States, the group performed for the first time in the United Kingdom at ''[[Good Morning Britain (2014 TV programme)|Good Morning Britain]]'' on June 5, 2015<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/goodmorningbritain/entertainment/fifth-harmony-are-worth-it-simon-cowell|title=Fifth Harmony get their inspiration from Spice Girls|publisher=ITV|date=June 5, 2015|accessdate=September 13, 2015}}</ref> as well as Capital FM's [[Summertime Ball]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] the following day<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalfm.com/artists/fifth-harmony/news/summertime-ball-lineup-2015/|title=#Harmonizers...

When reached to comment on the issue, a spokesperson for YouTube later commented saying that videos can be taken down by mistake but a review is taken to take \"appropriate action\", which include restoring videos that were previously removed. However, there could be another reason why it was taken down, which is because of its sexualized portrayal of Cabello and Jane, who were [[underage]]{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=February 2019}} when the video was filmed.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=John|title=Here's why Fifth Harmony's 'Worth It' video was removed from YouTube|url=http://fusion.kinja.com/heres-why-fifth-harmonys-worth-it-video-was-removed-fro-1793849391|website=Fusion|access-date=June 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Synopsis===\nThe video begins with shots of the skyline of [[Hong Kong]], where most of the setting takes place. An image of a stock market appears, zooming in on what appears to say, \"@FifthHarmony [[Women in positions of power|women in power]]\". The girls then appear in silhouettes and begin walking confidently as men stand next to a wall, appearing to stand in attention to the ladies. Individual shots of every girl are shown, giggling and smiling at the camera, before switching back to the stock market background. The group perform a choreographed dance move, and a [[Newton's cradle]] is shown being used, in rhythm to the song. The words \"break through the [[glass ceiling]]\" appear in stock market background, a reference to the obstacles that minorities, particularly minority women, have when climbing the corporate ladder.\n[[File:Fifth Harmony - Worth It ft. Kid Ink Music Video.png|thumb|250px|right|alt=|The members of [[Fifth Harmony]] dress in business-esque attire, demonstrating themes of [[feminism]] and [[Self-esteem|self-worth]].]]\nThe verse changes to Kid Ink, who is dressed in almost all-black clothing. He appears to be sitting in an office room with two attractive women approaching him as he sings. The women are dressed in business attire and are shown to have green eyes, known as a symbol for greed and/or jealousy. A man is shown cleaning Dinah's shoe, as she controls him. She then kicks him to show she is not controlled by anyone. The scene shifts to Normani, who is sporting a fashionable business outfit with a white blazer. She then dramatically stands up from her chair, while a man, who appears to be her accountant, looks at her in a frightened motion. Just like the women sitting next to Kid Ink, he also appears to have green eyes. All members perform a dance move, when the setting shifts to Camila getting ready to play golf in her office. Ally is then shown with a man who also appears to be her accountant, similar to Normani. Lauren is seen in the back of a convertible black car with a man in the driver's seat. Each girl either flicks the man next to them or kicks them in frustration.\n\nThe ladies are now in the stock market background, telling their lover that they're \"Worth It\". They also seem to rush their accountants, who are continuously typing on their calculators. The words ''\"[[feminism]] is sexy\"'' appear in the stock market background, before switching to Kid Ink, where the women move in-sync to the rhythm as he raps. The camera zooms into the eyes of a woman, with her eyes appearing bright green. The group perform more choreographed dance moves individually and as a group. Shots of all the members winking their eye, smiling, and showing confidence are shown. The video ends with the group facing away from the camera and looking at the stock market behind them, then turn around and move their hands upward, a similar ending to the group's past videos.\n\n==Live performances==\nFifth Harmony performed \"Worth It\" live for the first time on [[VH1]]'s ''[[Big Morning Buzz Live]]'' on February 17, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stern|first1=Bradley|title=Fifth Harmony Perform \"Worth It\" Live For The First Time: Watch|url=http://www.idolator.com/7581536/fifth-harmony-performance-worth-it-live-watch|publisher=Idolator|accessdate=February 20, 2015}}</ref> They performed the song on ''[[Live! with Kelly and Michael]]'' on April 13,<ref>{{cite web|title=Fifth Harmony Perform \"Worth It\" On \u2018Live With Kelly & Michael': Watch {{!}} Idolator|url=http://www.idolator.com/7588702/fifth-harmony-worth-it-live-kelly-michael-watch|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref> as well as on the [[Radio Disney Music Awards]] which aired on April 26, 2015.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://hollywoodlife.com/2015/04/27/fifth-harmony-performance-radio-disney-music-awards-2015-worth-it-video/|title=Fifth Harmony Rocks \u2018Worth It\u2019 At Radio Disney Music Awards \u2014 Watch|last=Wilson|first=Samantha|date=April 27, 2015|work=Hollywood Life|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref> The song was also performed on the finale of ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'' on May 19, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latintimes.com/pulse/watch-fifth-harmony-dancing-stars-finale-performance-totally-worth-it-video-317819|title=Watch Fifth Harmony 'Dancing With The Stars' Finale Performance Totally 'Worth It' [VIDEO]|accessdate=June 6, 2015}}</ref> Outside of the United States, the group performed for the first time in the United Kingdom at ''[[Good Morning Britain (2014 TV programme)|Good Morning Britain]]'' on June 5, 2015<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/goodmorningbritain/entertainment/fifth-harmony-are-worth-it-simon-cowell|title=Fifth Harmony get their inspiration from Spice Girls|publisher=ITV|date=June 5, 2015|accessdate=September 13, 2015}}</ref> as well as Capital FM's [[Summertime Ball]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] the following day<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalfm.com/artists/fifth-harmony/news/summertime-ball-lineup-2015/|title=#Harmonizers...

The SIG is a not-for-profit, non-stock corporation founded in September 1998.  The SIG is headquartered in [[Kirkland, Washington|Kirkland]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].  The SIG has local offices in Beijing, Seoul, Tokyo, and Malm\u00f6.\n\nThe SIG does not make, manufacture or sell Bluetooth enabled products.\n\n==Introduction==\n''Bluetooth'' technology provides a way to exchange information between [[wireless]] devices such as [[personal digital assistant]]s (PDAs), [[mobile phone]]s, [[laptop]]s, [[computer]]s, [[Computer printer|printers]] and [[digital camera]]s via a secure, low-cost, globally available short-range [[radio]] [[frequency]] band. Originally developed by [[Ericsson]], ''Bluetooth'' technology is now used in many different products by many different [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]]. These manufacturers must be either Associate or Promoter members of(see below) the Bluetooth SIG before they are granted early access to the ''Bluetooth'' specifications, but published ''Bluetooth'' specifications are available online via the Bluetooth SIG Website bluetooth.com.\n\nThe SIG owns the ''Bluetooth'' word mark, figure mark and combination mark.  These trademarks are licensed out for use to companies that are incorporating ''Bluetooth'' wireless technology into their products.  To become a licensee, a company must become a member of the Bluetooth SIG.  The SIG also manages the Bluetooth SIG Qualification program, a certification process required for any product using ''Bluetooth'' wireless technology and a pre-condition of the intellectual property license for ''Bluetooth'' technology. The main tasks for the SIG are to publish the ''Bluetooth'' specifications, protect the ''Bluetooth'' trademarks and evangelize ''Bluetooth'' wireless technology. In 2016, the SIG introduced a new visual and creative identity to support Bluetooth technology as the catalyst for the Internet of Things (IoT). This change included an updated logo, a new tagline and deprecation of the Bluetooth Smart and Bluetooth Smart Ready logos.<ref>https://www.bluetooth.com/marketing-branding/brand-best-practices-guidelines</ref>\n\nAt its inception in 1998, the Bluetooth SIG was primarily run by a staff effectively seconded from its member companies. In 2001 Tom Siep served as the group's managing director, and from 2002 to 2004 Mike McCamon led the group as its executive director. In 2004 he was replaced by [[Michael W. Foley]] (Mike). In mid-2012, Mark Powell took the reins as the SIG's current executive director. Beginning in 2002 a professional staff was hired, composed of operations, [[engineering]] and [[marketing]] specialists. From 2002 to 2004 the Bluetooth SIG was based in [[Overland Park, Kansas]], US, and is now based in [[Kirkland, Washington]]. In addition to its professional staff, the SIG is supported by its more than 35,000 member companies who participate in the various working groups that produce the standardization documents and oversee the qualification process for new products and help to evangelize the technology.\n\n==Structure==\nThe [[Special Interest Group|SIG]] members participate in study groups, expert groups, working groups along with committees.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Miga |first1=John |title=Remove Bluetooth Device in Windows 10? |url=https://silicophilic.com/cant-remove-bluetooth-device/ |website=Silicophilic |accessdate=15 June 2019 |date=10 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Study groups===\nThe study groups carry out research into their various areas which informs the development of the Bluetooth specifications. They may eventually become working groups in their own right.\n\n===Expert groups===\nThe expert groups deal with issues of technical importance to all aspects of ''Bluetooth'' development. As with the Study Groups their work informs the working groups as well as the corporate groups. \nParticipation in the Expert Groups is restricted to [[#Promoter members|Promoter members]] and [[#Associate members|Associate members]].\n\n===Working groups===\nThe working groups develop new Bluetooth specifications and enhance adopted specifications.

The SIG is a not-for-profit, non-stock corporation founded in September 1998.  The SIG is headquartered in [[Kirkland, Washington|Kirkland]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].  The SIG has local offices in Beijing, Seoul, Tokyo, and Malm\u00f6.\n\nThe SIG does not make, manufacture or sell Bluetooth enabled products.\n\n==Introduction==\n''Bluetooth'' technology provides a way to exchange information between [[wireless]] devices such as [[personal digital assistant]]s (PDAs), [[mobile phone]]s, [[laptop]]s, [[computer]]s, [[Computer printer|printers]] and [[digital camera]]s via a secure, low-cost, globally available short-range [[radio]] [[frequency]] band. Originally developed by [[Ericsson]], ''Bluetooth'' technology is now used in many different products by many different [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]]. These manufacturers must be either Associate or Promoter members of(see below) the Bluetooth SIG before they are granted early access to the ''Bluetooth'' specifications, but published ''Bluetooth'' specifications are available online via the Bluetooth SIG Website bluetooth.com.\n\nThe SIG owns the ''Bluetooth'' word mark, figure mark and combination mark.  These trademarks are licensed out for use to companies that are incorporating ''Bluetooth'' wireless technology into their products.  To become a licensee, a company must become a member of the Bluetooth SIG.  The SIG also manages the Bluetooth SIG Qualification program, a certification process required for any product using ''Bluetooth'' wireless technology and a pre-condition of the intellectual property license for ''Bluetooth'' technology. The main tasks for the SIG are to publish the ''Bluetooth'' specifications, protect the ''Bluetooth'' trademarks and evangelize ''Bluetooth'' wireless technology. In 2016, the SIG introduced a new visual and creative identity to support Bluetooth technology as the catalyst for the Internet of Things (IoT). This change included an updated logo, a new tagline and deprecation of the Bluetooth Smart and Bluetooth Smart Ready logos.<ref>https://www.bluetooth.com/marketing-branding/brand-best-practices-guidelines</ref>\n\nAt its inception in 1998, the Bluetooth SIG was primarily run by a staff effectively seconded from its member companies. In 2001 Tom Siep served as the group's managing director, and from 2002 to 2004 Mike McCamon led the group as its executive director. In 2004 he was replaced by [[Michael W. Foley]] (Mike). In mid-2012, Mark Powell took the reins as the SIG's current executive director. Beginning in 2002 a professional staff was hired, composed of operations, [[engineering]] and [[marketing]] specialists. From 2002 to 2004 the Bluetooth SIG was based in [[Overland Park, Kansas]], US, and is now based in [[Kirkland, Washington]]. In addition to its professional staff, the SIG is supported by its more than 30,000 member companies bluetooth.com who participate in the various working groups that produce the standardization documents and oversee the qualification process for new products and help to evangelize the technology.\n\n==Structure==\nThe [[Special Interest Group|SIG]] members participate in study groups, expert groups, working groups along with committees.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Miga |first1=John |title=Remove Bluetooth Device in Windows 10? |url=https://silicophilic.com/cant-remove-bluetooth-device/ |website=Silicophilic |accessdate=15 June 2019 |date=10 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Study groups===\nThe study groups carry out research into their various areas which informs the development of the Bluetooth specifications. They may eventually become working groups in their own right.\n\n===Expert groups===\nThe expert groups deal with issues of technical importance to all aspects of ''Bluetooth'' development. As with the Study Groups their work informs the working groups as well as the corporate groups. \nParticipation in the Expert Groups is restricted to [[#Promoter members|Promoter members]] and [[#Associate members|Associate members]].\n\n===Working groups===\nThe working groups develop new Bluetooth specifications and enhance adopted specifications.
