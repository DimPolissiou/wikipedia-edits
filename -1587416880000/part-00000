She was demonstrator in Genetics at McGill into 1940 and \"in the course of this work she discovered a new murine mutation.\"<ref name=\"IJRBRSPCM1984\" /> In 1940, her first son, Francis, was born, followed by a second son, Patrick, in 1942. After [[World War II]], she moved with her husband and children to England. However, her husband died in 1947 and her colleague Jack Boag would later note that she \"had to find work which would allow her freedom to bring up her two young sons.\"<ref name=\"IJRBRSPCM1984\" /> At the same time, [[Louis Harold Gray]] was looking for a cytologist to work in his radiobiology team at the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|UK Medical Research Council's]] Radiotherapeutic Research Unit at [[Hammersmith Hospital]]. By \"fortunate chance he was introduced to Dr. Howard and flexible working arrangements were readily agreed.\"<ref name=\"IJRBRSPCM1984\" /> On a preliminary visit to the Radiotherapeutic Research Unit, she met physicist Stephen Pelc who had developed a variant [[autoradiograph]] technique<ref name=\"MR1984\" /><ref name=\"Wynchank2017\">{{cite book|last1=Wynchank|first1=Sinclair|title=Louis Harold Gray A Founding Father of Radiobiology|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-43397-4|date=2016-09-27}}</ref> and \"was much interested in his use of radioactive iodine for the autoradiography of rat thyroid slices.\"<ref name=\"IJRBRSPCM1984\" />\n\nBy 1949, her youngest son was old enough to start prep-school and Howard joined the staff at Hammersmith, becoming part of [[Louis Harold Gray|Gray's]] team of scientists dedicated to studying the biological effects of ionizing radiation and to developing the use of radioactive isotopes.<ref name=\"MR1984\" /> As a geneticist, Howard already recognized the importance of DNA,<ref name=\"MR1984\" /> and although the [[double helix]] structure would not be discovered for a few more years, \"the idea that chromosomes are made of DNA was generally agreed on.\"<ref name=\"npg2017\">{{cite web|title=Milestone 3|url=http://www.nature.com/celldivision/milestones/full/milestone03.html|website=web focus on cell division|publisher=nature publishing group}}</ref> On her first day, she suggested to Stephen Pelc that radioactive phosphorus taken into the cell might be incorporated into [[DNA]] and give some information on the replication and synthesis of this important substance.<ref name=\"MR1984\" /> They injected a mouse with [[phosphorus-32]] to study the rate at which the isotope incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells in the testis and the resulting autoradiographs were promising.<ref name=\"IJRBRSPCM1984\" />  However, in animal cells and tissues the background radioactivity from remaining Phosphorus-32 made it impossible to obtain an autoradiograph localized down to individual chromosomes and parts of chromosomes.<ref name=\"MR1984\" />\n\nThere were a limited number of radioactive isotopes available in the early 1950s but Howard and Pelc switched to a botanical experimental system well established in Gray's lab, the bean root ''[[Vicia faba]]'', and they were then able to continue their research with [[Phosphorus-32]]. In plant cells, unlike animal tissues, the radioactive phosphorus is incorporated into fewer complex compounds. By chance they discovered a simple acid digestion removed most of the Phosphorus-32 not synthesized into DNA.<ref name=\"npg2017\" /> Looking at the uptake of Phosphorus-32 into the nucleus of dividing cells in the meristem of the broad bean root demonstrated the then \"surprising conclusion that DNA replication occurs during a limited period in interphase, which they called \"S-phase\", the preceding \"gap\" was termed G<sub>1</sub>, the subsequent one G<sub>2</sub>.\"<ref name=\"Heredity\" /><ref name=\"Kiefer2004\">{{cite book|editor-last1=Kiefer|editor-first1=J\u00fcrgen|title=Life sciences and radiation : accomplishments and future directions|date=2004|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin [etc.]|isbn=978-3-540-20478-7}}</ref> Howard and Pelc published this finding in 1953, the same year Watson and Crick published [[Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid]]. While Howard and Pelc were sure of the significance of their findings, \"the relevance of cell-cycle studies in the bean root to either cancer or medicine was not immediately accepted.\"<ref name=\"MR1984\" /> However, by 1957 [<sup>3</sup>H]-[[thymidine]] and [<sup>14</sup>C]-[[adenine]] radioligands became available, enabling animal studies, and consequently the whole basis of cell kinetics was developed from their original concepts.<ref name=\"MR1984\" />\n\nWhile at Hammersmith, Howard also worked with Michael Ebert. They discovered that \"excess pressures of the rare gases xenon, krypton and argon could suppress the oxygen enhancement effect on the radiation killing of [[Vicia faba]] cells.\"<ref name=\"IJRBRSPCM1984\" /> In 1956 Howard left Hammersmith and joined the new radiobiology research unit Gray was setting up at [[Mount Vernon Hospital]]. In 1958 she married Michael Ebert.<ref name=\"IJRBRSPCM1984\" />\n\nIn 1960 she was appointed Secretary-General of the 2nd International Radiation Research Congress, which was held in Harrogate in 1962. In 1963 both Howard and Ebert moved to [[The Christie NHS Foundation Trust#Paterson Institute for Cancer Research|Paterson Laboratories]], where Howard was Head of the Radiobiology Group. They started, as joint editors, the journal ''Current Topics in Radiation Research''. In 1966, Howard became Deputy Director at the Paterson Laboratories and also Joint Editor of [[International Journal of Radiation Biology]], the later position held until her death.<ref name=\"IJRBRSPCM1984\" /> She \"served the research community well by her rigorous standards of scientific accuracy and of literary style.\"<ref name=\"IJRBRSPCM1984\" /> Additional appointments included Chairman of the Association of Radiation Research and of the British Association for Cancer Research, and as Secretary and later Chairman of the L.H.

She was demonstrator in Genetics at McGill into 1940 and \"in the course of this work she discovered a new murine mutation.\"<ref name=\"IJRBRSPCM1984\" /> In 1940, her first son, Francis, was born, followed by a second son, Patrick, in 1942. After [[World War II]], she moved with her husband and children to England. However, her husband died in 1947 and her colleague Jack Boag would later note that she \"had to find work which would allow her freedom to bring up her two young sons.\"<ref name=\"IJRBRSPCM1984\" /> At the same time, [[Louis Harold Gray]] was looking for a cytologist to work in his radiobiology team at the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|UK Medical Research Council's]] Radiotherapeutic Research Unit at [[Hammersmith Hospital]]. By \"fortunate chance he was introduced to Dr. Howard and flexible working arrangements were readily agreed.\"<ref name=\"IJRBRSPCM1984\" /> On a preliminary visit to the Radiotherapeutic Research Unit, she met physicist Stephen Pelc who had developed a variant [[autoradiograph]] technique<ref name=\"MR1984\" /><ref name=\"Wynchank2017\">{{cite book|last1=Wynchank|first1=Sinclair|title=Louis Harold Gray A Founding Father of Radiobiology|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-43397-4|date=2016-09-27}}</ref> and \"was much interested in his use of radioactive iodine for the autoradiography of rat thyroid slices.\"<ref name=\"IJRBRSPCM1984\" />\n\nBy 1949, her youngest son was old enough to start prep-school and Howard joined the staff at Hammersmith, becoming part of [[Louis Harold Gray|Gray's]] team of scientists dedicated to studying the biological effects of ionizing radiation and to developing the use of radioactive isotopes.<ref name=\"MR1984\" /> As a geneticist, Howard already recognized the importance of DNA,<ref name=\"MR1984\" /> and although the [[double helix]] structure would not be discovered for a few more years, \"the idea that chromosomes are made of DNA was generally agreed on.\"<ref name=\"npg2017\">{{cite web|title=Milestone 3|url=http://www.nature.com/celldivision/milestones/full/milestone03.html|website=web focus on cell division|publisher=nature publishing group}}</ref> On her first day, she suggested to Stephen Pelc that radioactive phosphorus taken into the cell might be incorporated into [[DNA]] and give some information on the replication and synthesis of this important substance.<ref name=\"MR1984\" /> They injected a mouse with [[phosphorus-32]] to study the rate at which the isotope incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells in the testis and the resulting autoradiographs were promising.<ref name=\"IJRBRSPCM1984\" />  However, in animal cells and tissues the background radioactivity from remaining Phosphorus-32 made it impossible to obtain an autoradiograph localized down to individual chromosomes and parts of chromosomes.<ref name=\"MR1984\" />\n\nThere were a limited number of radioactive isotopes available in the early 1950s but Howard and Pelc switched to a botanical experimental system well established in Gray's lab, the bean root ''[[Vicia faba]]'', and they were then able to continue their research with [[Phosphorus-32]]. In plant cells, unlike animal tissues, the radioactive phosphorus is incorporated into fewer complex compounds. By chance they discovered a simple acid digestion removed most of the Phosphorus-32 not synthesized into DNA.<ref name=\"npg2017\" /> Looking at the uptake of Phosphorus-32 into the nucleus of dividing cells in the meristem of the broad bean root demonstrated the then \"surprising conclusion that DNA replication occurs during a limited period in interphase, which they called \"S-phase\", the preceding \"gap\" was termed G<sub>1</sub>, the subsequent one G<sub>2</sub>.\"<ref name=\"Heredity\" /><ref name=\"Kiefer2004\">{{cite book|editor-last1=Kiefer|editor-first1=J\u00fcrgen|title=Life sciences and radiation : accomplishments and future directions|date=2004|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin [etc.]|isbn=978-3-540-20478-7}}</ref> Howard and Pelc published this finding in 1953, the same year Watson and Crick published [[Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid]].

They discovered that \"excess pressures of the rare gases xenon, krypton and argon could suppress the oxygen enhancement effect on the radiation killing of [[Vicia faba]] cells.\"<ref name=\"IJRBRSPCM1984\" /> In 1956 Howard left Hammersmith and joined the new radiobiology research unit Gray was setting up at [[Mount Vernon Hospital]].

The canoeing and camping trips with her father and brothers sparked her interest in [[fossil]]s. Her family also encouraged scholarly thought and the pursuit of scientific knowledge.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> In 1901 Wilson began studying [[modern language]] and history at the [[Victoria University, Toronto|Victoria College]] in Toronto. She did not finish her last year of studies due to ill health. But she was hired by the Mineralogy Division of the [[University of Toronto]] Museum, thus beginning her career in [[geology]].<ref name=\"auto1\"/> She later completed her degree and, in 1907, was hired into a permanent position as a museum technician at the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] (GSC), which was headquartered at the Victoria Memorial Museum in Ottawa.\n\nWilson persisted through seven years of being denied time off to pursue a higher degree in geology. Eventually, the [[Canadian Federation of University Women]] awarded her a scholarship so that she could embark on graduate studies<ref name=\"auto\"/> at the [[University of Chicago]]. She graduated in 1929 with a doctorate in geology.\n\nAt the GSC, Wilson could not participate in fieldwork that required living in camps with men in remote regions.

The canoeing and camping trips with her father and brothers sparked her interest in [[fossil]]s. Her family also encouraged scholarly thought and the pursuit of scientific knowledge.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> In 1901 Wilson began studying [[modern language]] and history at the [[Victoria University, Toronto|Victoria College]] in Toronto. She did not finish her last year of studies due to ill health. But she was hired by the Mineralogy Division of the [[University of Toronto]] Museum, thus beginning her career in [[geology]].<ref name=\"auto1\"/> She later completed her degree and, in 1907, was hired into a permanent position as a museum technician at the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] (GSC), which was headquartered at the Victoria Memorial Museum in Ottawa.\n\nWilson persisted through seven years of being denied time off to pursue a higher degree in geology. Eventually, the [[Canadian Federation of University Women]] awarded her a scholarship so that she could embark on graduate studies<ref name=\"auto\"/> at the [[University of Chicago]]. She graduated in 1929 with a doctorate in geology.\n\nAt the GSC, Wilson could not participate in fieldwork that required living in camps with men in remote regions. Instead, Wilson created her own niche and did fieldwork at local sites in the Ottawa area. For the next fifty years she studied this area on foot, by bicycle and eventually by car.<ref name=\"auto\"/> The GSC published the results of her fieldwork in 1946 and her ''Geology of the St. Lawrence Lowland, Ontario and Quebec'' was the first major geological publication about the area.
