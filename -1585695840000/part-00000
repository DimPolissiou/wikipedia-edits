It is frequently divided into 5 grades, with 0-2 defined as normal and 3-4 defined as diseased.\n\n==Some common diseases affecting/involving the cartilage==\n\n* [[Achondroplasia]]: Reduced proliferation of [[chondrocytes]] in the [[epiphyseal plate]] of long bones during infancy and childhood, resulting in dwarfism.\n* [[Cartilage tumors]]\n*[[Costochondritis]]: Inflammation of cartilage in the ribs, causing chest pain.\n*[[Osteoarthritis]]: The cartilage covering bones ([[articular cartilage]]) is thinned, eventually completely worn out, resulting in a \"bone against bone\" joint, resulting in pain and reduced mobility. Osteoarthritis is very common, affects the joints exposed to high stress and is therefore considered the result of \"wear and tear\" rather than a true disease. It is treated by [[Arthroplasty]], the replacement of the joint by a synthetic joint made of titanium and teflon. [[Chondroitin sulfate]], a monomer of the [[polysaccharide]] portion of [[proteoglycan]], has been shown to reduce the symptoms of [[osteoarthritis]], possibly by increasing the [[Biosynthesis|synthesis]] of the extracellular matrix.\n*[[Spinal disc herniation]]: Asymmetrical compression of an intervertebral disc ruptures the sac-like disc, causing a herniation of its soft content. The hernia compresses the adjacent nerves and causes back pain.\n*[[Relapsing polychondritis]]: a destruction, probably autoimmune, of cartilage, especially of the nose and ears, causing disfiguration.

Osteoarthritis is very common, affects the joints exposed to high stress and is therefore considered the result of \"wear and tear\" rather than a true disease. It is treated by [[Arthroplasty]], the replacement of the joint by a synthetic joint made of titanium and teflon. [[Chondroitin sulfate]], a monomer of the [[polysaccharide]] portion of [[proteoglycan]], has been shown to reduce the symptoms of [[osteoarthritis]], possibly by increasing the [[Biosynthesis|synthesis]] of the extracellular matrix.\n*[[Spinal disc herniation]]: Asymmetrical compression of an intervertebral disc ruptures the sac-like disc, causing a herniation of its soft content. The hernia compresses the adjacent nerves and causes back pain.\n*[[Relapsing polychondritis]]: a destruction, probably autoimmune, of cartilage, especially of the nose and ears, causing disfiguration.

The genre has also been referred to as \"French touch\", \"filter house\" and \"tekfunk\" over the years. The defining characteristics of the sound are heavy reliance on [[Audio filter|filter]] and [[Phaser (effect)|phaser]] effects both on and alongside [[Sample (music)|samples]] from late 1970s and early 1980s American or European [[disco]] tracks (or original [[Hook (music)|hooks]] strongly inspired by such samples), causing thicker harmonic foundations than the genre's descendants. Most tracks in this vein feature steady [[4/4 time|{{music|time|4|4}}]] beats with a tempo range of 110\u2013130 [[beats per minute]]. French house tends to be confused with a genre known as [[future funk]], although they are not the same genre.\n\nCelebrated and successful purveyors of this music include [[Daft Punk]],<ref>[http://www.villagevoice.com/music/9940,woods,8763,22.html Village Voice: Daft Punk by Scott Woods<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Cassius (band)|Cassius]], [[The Supermen Lovers]], [[Modjo]], [[\u00c9tienne de Cr\u00e9cy]], [[Fred Falke]], and [[Alan Braxe]].\n\n== History and influences ==\n\nFrench house is greatly influenced by the lineage of American dance music from the emergence of disco onwards, maintaining a distinct connection to [[Euro disco]] and the short lived [[space disco]] music style. Space disco was very popular in France, with artists like [[Cerrone]], [[Space (electronic band)|Space]] and [[Sheila (singer)|Sheila B. Devotion]] during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Additional influences came from [[P-Funk]], especially the [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Bootsy Collins]] hits of that era. Due to originating from the same foreign market, P-Funk was played alongside disco in many French discoth\u00e8ques, especially after the [[Disco Demolition Night]] took place in the United States. The [[Jacking]] aspect of [[Chicago house]] was also picked up on as a theme to incorporate (with \"jack house\" becoming a short-lived descriptive term for the sound in the UK). Furthermore, the influence of musical French figures of the seventies as [[Fran\u00e7ois de Roubaix]], [[Jean-Michel Jarre]] or [[Serge Gainsbourg]] was also critical. An early example of French house could be ''Dance'' released in 1990 by Earth People.\n\n[[Thomas Bangalter]]'s tracks for his [[Roul\u00e9]] label may be considered the earliest examples of an attempt to establish a distinctive style of French house. His solo material, along with his work as a member of [[Daft Punk]] and [[Stardust (band)|Stardust]], had a significant impact upon the French house scene during the mid-to-late 1990s.<ref name=\"Mixmag 2006\">Suzanne Ely, \"Return of the Cybermen\" ''[[Mixmag]]'', July 2006, pp. 94\u201398.</ref> The French duo [[Motorbass]] (Philippe Zdar, later of [[Cassius (band)|Cassius]], and [[\u00c9tienne de Cr\u00e9cy]]) were also among the first in France to produce house tracks which were largely based around samples and filtered loops \u2013 in turn inspired by emerging American house producers such as [[DJ Sneak]], [[Green Velvet]] and [[Roger Sanchez]] and their penchant for producing sample-led house tracks with deep funky grooves \u2013 and released a sole full-length album, ''[[Pansoul]]''. Parisian producer [[St. Germain (musician)|St. Germain]] produced house tracks with a similar style at the time but these were more directly influenced by [[jazz]] as opposed to the brasher vocal disco records appropriated, while other known French DJ-turned-producers at the time such as [[Fran\u00e7ois Kevorkian]] and [[Laurent Garnier]] remained relatively distant from the emerging French house label.\n\nThe first French house experiments were warmly received by the UK dance music press and European DJ's in the mid-1990s but major commercial success did not occur until 1997. [[Daft Punk]], [[Cassius (band)|Cassius]] and, later, [[Stardust (band)|Stardust]] were the first internationally successful artists of the genre. Along with [[Air (French band)|Air]] these acts were signed to [[Virgin Records]] and benefited from distinctive music videos directed by the likes of [[Spike Jonze]], [[Michel Gondry]] and Alex & Martin. Due to a reasonable amount of buzz generated from the huge clubbing scene and major record company support, Daft Punk's debut album ''[[Homework (Daft Punk album)|Homework]]'' entered the top 10 of the [[UK Albums Chart|UK album charts]] on release and they effectively became the biggest-selling French act in the UK since [[Jean-Michel Jarre]]. The emergence of the French sound was well-timed as dance music's popularity in the influential UK market was peaking commercially with general [[electronic music]].\n\nFurther international commercial success continued into 2000 with [[Bob Sinclar]], [[\u00c9tienne de Cr\u00e9cy]], [[Benjamin Diamond]] and [[Modjo]] achieving hit singles around Europe. In late 2005, pop superstar [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] released ''[[Confessions on a Dance Floor]]'', an album with significant French house influences in several of its songs.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nAs of the mid to late-2010s, there is a resurgence in interest in French house, with material being released from artists such as Folamour and Mirrorball Disco Squad from Paris, as well as Tiger and Woods from Italy. This sound is also being championed on the lo-fi house scene by the likes of Mall Grab and Loods.\n\n== Terms, origins and variations ==\n\nThe term \"French touch\" was first used in Paris in July 1987. Jean-Claude Lagr\u00e8ze, a photographer of parisians' nights created a couple of \"French Touch\" parties at The Palace to make people discover house music. These parties were driven by DJ Laurent Garnier, Guillaume la Tortue and David Guetta. This expression was printed, as part of a motto for French partygoers who liked house music, on a trendy jacket by \u00c9ric Morand for Fnac Music Dance Division, in 1991. The motto was: \"We Give a French Touch to House\".{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} British music journalists used the expression and contributed to the diffusion of this movement.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe first time this term was used widespreadly by [[MTV (UK and Ireland)|MTV UK]] during the Christmas holiday period of 1999. It was used on an MTV News special, to describe a so-called \"French house explosion\" phenomenon. Bob Sinclar was interviewed, as well as Air (a non-house act) and [[Cassius (band)|Cassius]]. This news special later aired on all the MTV local variations worldwide, spreading the term and introducing the \"French house\" sound to the mainstream.\n\nPrior to that (1996\u20132000), \"French house\" had been referred to among Europeans as \"nu disco\", \"disco house\" and \"new disco\". However, the term \"French touch\" was first used by music journalist Martin James in his 1996 review of the first Super Discount EP in the now defunct weekly music paper ''[[Melody Maker]]''. This term became favoured among the French media and was then widely used in the UK press by 1998.<ref>'French Connections: From Discotheque to Discovery' by Martin James, 2002, Sanctuary Publishing</ref> Martin James was later recognised by French newspaper Liberation and Radio NRJ as the journalist responsible for naming the French house phenomenon \"French touch\".\n\nOne of the biggest markets for nu disco at the time was [[Greece]], especially [[Athens]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} A local music shop called Discobole Records imported the records direct from France and middle class clubs like City Groove dedicated totally to the genre between 1998 and 2001. In Greece, this music style was promoted as \"disco house\". At the same time, disco house began to gain success in [[Canada]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} During 1999 many events also took place on Spain's [[Ibiza]] island, a very popular destination for British tourists.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nFrench house is essentially a combination of three production styles. One is what the French still refer as \"the French touch\" and it is the style that greatly influenced by the [[space disco]] sound. The second is a continuation and update of [[Euro disco]] and greatly influenced by the productions of [[Alec R. Costandinos]]. The third would be the deep American house style as evident in the similar treatment of samples and repetitive 'funky' hooks. Naturally, further variations and mutations followed. French house maintains the established \"French touch\" sound, focused more on Euro disco-like vocals and less emphasis on the \"space disco\" themes. However, most of the music's most successful acts have altered their sound since. Bob Sinclar's later work, including the hit single \"[[World, Hold On (Children of the Sky)]]\", which had a video based on a science fiction theme, maintains only a distant connection to the original French house sound. Both Daft Punk and Etienne de Crecy subsequently developed a harder synthetic sound more directly inspired by techno, electro and pop.\n\nIn Ibiza, disco house took later another direction: it combined vocals and some elements from the UK's [[speed garage]] (a mid 1990s music style) with a local Latin flavor. By 2007, many underground disco house productions belonged to the Ibiza school.\n\n== Artists associated with the style ==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=}}\n* [[Abraxis (musician)|Abraxis]]\n* [[Alan Braxe]]\n* [[Alex Gopher]]\n* [[B-COM]]\n* [[Benjamin Diamond]]\n* [[Bob Sinclar]]\n* [[Breakbot]]\n* [[Cassius (band)|Cassius]]\n* Cherokee\n* [[Daft Punk]]\n* [[Daliesk]]\n* [[Danger (musician)|Danger]]\n* [[Dave Armstrong (producer)|Dave Armstrong]]\n* [[David Guetta]]\n* [[Demon (musician)|Demon]]\n* [[DJ EQ]]\n* [[DJ Falcon]]\n* [[Dmitri from Paris]]\n* [[Dynamic Rockers]]\n* [[\u00c9tienne de Cr\u00e9cy]]\n* [[Fred Falke]]\n* [[French Kiwi Juice]]\n* [[Grand Popo Football Club]]<ref>[http://www.francomix.com/article-L_electro_francophone_1995_2004-119.html], L'electro Fran\u00e7aise 1995-2004.</ref>\n* [[Helius Arcadia]]\n* [[I:Cube]]\n* [[Jean Jerome]]\n* [[Justice (band)|Justice]]\n* [[Kavinsky]]\n* [[Kris Menace]]\n* [[Kiko (DJ)|Kiko]]\n* [[Le Knight Club]]\n* {{ill|Lifelike (musician)|lt=Lifelike|fr|Lifelike|WD=}}\n* [[Lucky Sound Soda]]\n* [[Kungs]]\n* [[Laurent Garnier]]\n* [[Laurent Schark]]\n* [[Louis La Roche]]\n* [[Mac Stanton]]\n* [[Madeon]]\n* [[Modjo]]\n* [[Motorbass]]\n* [[Mr. Flash]]\n* [[Mr. Oizo]]\n* [[The Ones]]\n* [[Patrick Alavi]]\n* [[Phoenix (band)|Phoenix]]\n* [[Salvator (musician)|Salvator]]\n* [[Sinema (DJ)|Sinema]]\n* [[S\u00e9bastien L\u00e9ger]]\n* [[Sedat The Turkish Avenger]]\n* [[Somiak]]\n* [[Stardust (band)|Stardust]]\n* [[Stephane Pompougnac]]\n* [[Superfunk (band)|Superfunk]]\n* [[The Blaze (band)|The Blaze]]\n* [[The M Machine]]\n* [[The Supermen Lovers]]\n* [[Tahiti 80]]\n* [[Thomas Bangalter]]\n* [[Together (French band)|Together]]\n* [[Vitalic]]\n* [[V-real]]\n* [[We In Music]]\n* [[Yuksek]]{{colend}}\n\n== Record labels associated with the style ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Astralwerks]] (US market)\n* [[:fr:Bromance records|Bromance]]\n* [[Crydamoure]]\n* [[:fr::Solid (label)|Disques Solid]]\n* [[Dynamic Recordings]]\n* [[Ed Banger Records]]\n* [[F Communications]]\n* [[Fiat Lux]]\n* [[Kitsun\u00e9]]\n* [[Roul\u00e9]]\n* [[So French Records]]\n* [[:fr:Versatile Records|Versatile Records]]\n* [[Work It Baby]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{house music}}\n\n[[Category:House music genres]]\n[[Category:French styles of music]]\n[[Category:French house| ]]\n[[Category:Music scenes]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|places named \"French House\"|The French House (disambiguation)}}\n{{tone|date=December 2018}}\n{{Refimprove|date=April 2007}}\n{{Infobox music genre\n| name = French house\n| bgcolor = silver\n| color = black\n| stylistic_origins = {{hlist|[[Euro disco]]|[[disco]]|[[house music|house]]|[[Chicago house]]|[[deep house]]}}\n| cultural_origins = Early to mid-1990s, France\n| instruments = {{hlist|[[Sampler (musical instrument)|Sampler]]|[[drum machine]]|[[synthesizer]]|[[Music sequencer|sequencer]]}}\n| derivatives ={{hlist|[[Nu-disco]]}}\n| subgenrelist =\n| subgenres = \n| fusiongenres = French electro\n| regional_scenes =\n| other_topics = {{hlist|[[Nu-disco]]|[[funky house]]|[[future funk]]}}\n}}\n\n'''French house''' is a style of [[house music]] originally produced by [[France|French]] artists, a popular strand of the late 1990s and 2000s [[Europe]]an dance music scene and a form of [[Euro disco]].

By 2007, many underground disco house productions belonged to the Ibiza school.\n\n== Artists associated with the style ==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=}}\n* [[Abraxis (musician)|Abraxis]]\n* [[Alan Braxe]]\n* [[Alex Gopher]]\n* [[B-COM]]\n* [[Benjamin Diamond]]\n* [[Bob Sinclar]]\n* [[Breakbot]]\n* [[Cassius (band)|Cassius]]\n* Cherokee\n* [[Daft Punk]]\n* [[Daliesk]]\n* [[Danger (musician)|Danger]]\n* [[Dave Armstrong (producer)|Dave Armstrong]]\n* [[David Guetta]]\n* [[Demon (musician)|Demon]]\n* [[DJ EQ]]\n* [[DJ Falcon]]\n* [[Dynamic Rockers]]\n* [[\u00c9tienne de Cr\u00e9cy]]\n* [[Fred Falke]]\n* [[French Kiwi Juice]]\n* [[Grand Popo Football Club]]<ref>[http://www.francomix.com/article-L_electro_francophone_1995_2004-119.html], L'electro Fran\u00e7aise 1995-2004.</ref>\n* [[Helius Arcadia]]\n* [[I:Cube]]\n* [[Jean Jerome]]\n* [[Justice (band)|Justice]]\n* [[Kavinsky]]\n* [[Kris Menace]]\n* [[Kiko (DJ)|Kiko]]\n* [[Le Knight Club]]\n* {{ill|Lifelike (musician)|lt=Lifelike|fr|Lifelike|WD=}}\n* [[Lucky Sound Soda]]\n* [[Kungs]]\n* [[Laurent Garnier]]\n* [[Laurent Schark]]\n* [[Louis La Roche]]\n* [[Mac Stanton]]\n* [[Madeon]]\n* [[Modjo]]\n* [[Motorbass]]\n* [[Mr. Flash]]\n* [[Mr. Oizo]]\n* [[The Ones]]\n* [[Patrick Alavi]]\n* [[Phoenix (band)|Phoenix]]\n* [[Salvator (musician)|Salvator]]\n* [[Sinema (DJ)|Sinema]]\n* [[S\u00e9bastien L\u00e9ger]]\n* [[Sedat The Turkish Avenger]]\n* [[Somiak]]\n* [[Stardust (band)|Stardust]]\n* [[Superfunk (band)|Superfunk]]\n* [[The Blaze (band)|The Blaze]]\n* [[The M Machine]]\n* [[The Supermen Lovers]]\n* [[Tahiti 80]]\n* [[Thomas Bangalter]]\n* [[Together (French band)|Together]]\n* [[Vitalic]]\n* [[V-real]]\n* [[We In Music]]\n* [[Yuksek]]{{colend}}\n\n== Record labels associated with the style ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Astralwerks]] (US market)\n* [[:fr:Bromance records|Bromance]]\n* [[Crydamoure]]\n* [[:fr::Solid (label)|Disques Solid]]\n* [[Dynamic Recordings]]\n* [[Ed Banger Records]]\n* [[F Communications]]\n* [[Fiat Lux]]\n* [[Kitsun\u00e9]]\n* [[Roul\u00e9]]\n* [[So French Records]]\n* [[:fr:Versatile Records|Versatile Records]]\n* [[Work It Baby]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{house music}}\n\n[[Category:House music genres]]\n[[Category:French styles of music]]\n[[Category:French house| ]]\n[[Category:Music scenes]]\n", "name_user": "Styles01", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eArtists associated with the style", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_house"}

Arterial embolism are those that follow and, if not dissolved on the way, lodge in a more distal part of the [[systemic circulation]]. Sometimes, multiple classifications apply; for instance a [[pulmonary embolism]] is classified as an arterial embolism as well,<ref name=medlineplus>[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001102.htm MedlinePlus > Arterial embolism] Sean O. Stitham, MD and David C. Dugdale III, MD. Also reviewed by David Zieve, MD. Reviewed last on: 5/8/2008. Alternative link: [http://www.umm.edu/ency/article/001102.htm]</ref> in the sense that the clot follows the [[pulmonary artery]] carrying deoxygenated blood away from the heart. However, pulmonary embolism is generally classified as a form of venous embolism, because the embolus forms in veins, e.g. [[deep vein thrombosis]].\n\n===Arterial===\n{{Main|Arterial embolism}}\n[[Arterial embolism]] can cause occlusion in any part of the body. It is a major cause of [[infarction]] (tissue death from blockage of the blood supply).\n\nAn embolus lodging in the [[brain]] from either the [[heart]] or a [[carotid artery]] will most likely be the cause of a [[stroke]] due to [[ischemia]].\n\nAn arterial embolus might originate in the heart (from a thrombus in the [[left atrium]], following [[atrial fibrillation]] or be a septic embolus resulting from [[endocarditis]]). Emboli of [[heart|cardiac origin]] are frequently encountered in clinical practice.  Thrombus formation within the atrium occurs mainly in patients with [[mitral valve]] disease, and especially in those with [[mitral valve]] [[stenosis]] (narrowing), with [[atrial fibrillation]] (AF).  In the absence of AF, pure mitral regurgitation has a low incidence of thromboembolism.\n\nThe risk of emboli forming in AF depends on other risk factors such as age, [[hypertension]], [[diabetes]], recent [[heart failure]], or previous [[stroke]].\nThrombus formation can also take place within the [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricles]], and it occurs in approximately 30% of anterior-wall [[myocardial infarction]]s, compared with only 5% of inferior ones. Some other risk factors are poor ejection fraction (<35%), size of infarct, and the presence of AF. In the first three months after infarction, left-ventricle [[aneurysm]]s have a 10% risk of emboli forming.\n\nPatients with [[prosthetic]] valves also carry a significant increase in risk of thromboembolism. Risk varies, based on the valve type (bioprosthetic or mechanical); the position (mitral or aortic); and the presence of other factors such as AF, left-ventricular dysfunction, and previous emboli.\n\nEmboli often have more serious consequences when they occur in the so-called \"end circulation\": areas of the body that have no redundant blood supply, such as the [[brain]] and [[heart]].\n\n===Venous===\n{{Further|Pulmonary embolism}}\n{{See|Thrombosis prophylaxis}}\nAssuming a normal circulation, an embolus formed in a systemic [[vein]] will always impact in the lungs, after passing through the right side of the heart. This will form a [[pulmonary embolism]] that will result in a blockage of the [[pulmonary artery|main artery of the lung]] and can be a complication of [[deep-vein thrombosis]]. The most common sites of origin of pulmonary emboli are the [[femoral vein|''femoral'' veins]]. The deep veins of the calf are the most common sites of actual thrombi.\n\n===Paradoxical (venous to arterial)===\nIn [[paradoxical embolism]], also known as crossed embolism, an embolus from the veins crosses to the arterial blood system. This is generally found only with heart problems such as septal defects  (holes in the cardiac septum) between the atria or ventricles. The most common such abnormality is [[patent foramen ovale]], occurring in about 25% of the adult population, but here the defect functions as a valve which is normally closed, because pressure is slightly higher in the left side of the heart. Sometimes, for example if a patient coughs just when an embolus is passing, it might cross to the arterial system.\n\n===Direction===\nThe direction of the embolus can be one of two types:\n* Anterograde\n* Retrograde\n\nIn anterograde embolism, the movement of emboli is in the direction of blood flow. In retrograde embolism, the emboli move in opposition to the blood flow direction; this is usually significant only in blood vessels with low pressure (veins) or with emboli of high weight.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''embolism'' comes from the Greek \u1f10\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2, meaning \"interposition\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[Embolectomy]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n| DiseasesDB      = 18165\n| ICD10           = {{ICD10|I|74||i|70}}, {{ICD10|I|82||i|80}}, {{ICD10|O|88||o|85}}, {{ICD10|T|79|0|t|79}}-{{ICD10|T|79|1|t|79}}\n| ICD9            = {{ICD9|444.9}}\n| ICDO            = \n| OMIM            = \n| MedlinePlus     = \n| eMedicineSubj   = \n| eMedicineTopic  = \n| MeshID          = D004617\n| SNOMED CT       = 414086009\n}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120309144010/http://rad.usuhs.edu/medpix/tf_case.html?pt_id=10480&quiz=no MR of Fat Embolism] Brain Injury from Fat Embolism\n\n{{Vascular diseases}}\n{{Pathology of pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium}}\n{{Certain early complications of trauma}}\n\n[[Category:Hematology]]\n[[Category:Diseases of arteries, arterioles and capillaries]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the vascular phenomenon|other uses|Embolism (disambiguation)}}\n{{distinguish|ebullism|aneurysm}}\n{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n| name            = Embolism\n| image        = Embolization kidney.jpg\n| caption      = [[Micrograph]] of embolic material in the artery of a kidney.

As with most Germanic invasions, the number of the original Suebi is estimated to be relatively low, generally fewer than 100,000,<ref>80,000 Vandals and Alans passed into Africa in 429, on the account of [[Victor Vitensis]].</ref> and most often around 30,000 people.<ref>Cf.

In 438 [[Hermeric]] ratified a peace treaty with the ''Gallaeci'', the native and partially [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanized]] people.\n\nIllness led Hermeric to [[abdicate]] in favor of his son, [[Rechila]], who moved his troops to the south and the east, conquering [[M\u00e9rida, Spain|M\u00e9rida]] and [[Seville]], the capitals of the Roman provinces of [[Lusitania]] and [[Betica]].<ref>Thompson (2002) p. 162.</ref> In 448 Rechila died, leaving the expanding state to his son [[Rechiar]], who in 449 became one of the first Germanic kings of post-Roman Europe to convert to Catholicism. Rechiar married a Visigothic princess, and was also the first Germanic king to mint coins in ancient Roman territories. Rechiar led further expansions to the east, marauding through the ''Provincia [[Tarraconensis]]'', which was still held by Rome. The Roman emperor [[Avitus]] sent a large army of ''foederates'', under the direction of the Visigoth [[Theoderic II]], who defeated the Suebi army by the river [[\u00d3rbigo]], near modern-day [[Astorga, Spain|Astorga]]. Rechiar fled, but he was pursued and captured, then executed in 457.\n\nIn the aftermath of Rechiar's death, multiple candidates for the throne appeared, finally grouping into two allegiances. The division between the two groups was marked by the [[Minho River|Minius River]] (now Minho River), probably as a consequence of the localities of the [[Quadi]] and [[Marcomanni]] tribes, who constituted the Suebi nation on the [[Iberian Peninsula]].<ref>Together with the Suebi came another Germanic tribe, the [[Buri (Germanic tribe)|Buri]], that settled in the lands known as ''[[Terras de Bouro]]'' (Lands of the Buri) in what is now Portugal.</ref> The Suebi in the north conquered Lugo, proceeding to use that city as their co-capital, while the Suebi in the south expanded into [[Lisbon]] and [[Conimbriga]], which were assaulted, and abandoned after their Roman inhabitants were banished.

Later, King [[Theodemir (Suebian king)|Theodemar]] ordered an administrative and ecclesiastical division of his kingdom, with the creation of new [[Diocese|bishoprics]] and the promotion of Lugo, which possessed a large Suebi community, to the level of [[Metropolitan Bishop]] along with Braga.\n\nTheodemar's son and successor, King [[Miro (Suevic king)|Miro]], called for the [[Second Council of Braga]], which was attended by all the bishops of the kingdom, from the [[Britons (historical)|Briton]] bishopric of [[Britonia]] in the [[Bay of Biscay]], to [[Astorga, Spain|Astorga]] in the east, and [[Coimbra]] and [[Idanha-a-Nova Municipality|Idanha]] in the south. Five of the attendant bishops used Germanic names, showing the integration of the different communities of the country. King Miro also promoted contention with the Arian Visigoths, who under the leadership of King [[Leovigild]] were rebuilding their fragmented kingdom which had been ruled mostly by [[Ostrogoths]] since the beginning of the 6th century, following the defeat and expulsion of [[Aquitania]] by the Franks. After clashing in frontier lands, Miro and Leovigild agreed upon a temporary peace.\n\nThe Suebi maintained their independence until 585, when Leovigild, on the pretext of conflict over the succession, invaded the Suebic kingdom and finally defeated it. [[Audeca]], the last king of the Suebi, who had deposed his brother-in-law [[Eboric]], held out for a year before being captured in 585. This same year a nobleman named [[Malaric]] rebelled against the Goths, but he was defeated.<ref>Arias (2007) pp. 32\u201333.</ref>\n\nAs with the Visigothic language, there are only traces of the Suebi tongue remaining, as they quickly adopted the local [[vulgar Latin]].

He also wrote two [[monastic]] rulebooks, characterized by their pact-like nature, with the monastic communities ruled by an [[abbot]], under the remote authority of a bishop (''episcopus sub regula''),<ref>Isla Fern\u00e1ndez (1992) pp. 33-34-</ref> and each integrant of the congregation having signed a written pact with him.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bishko|first=Charles Julian|title=Spanish and Portuguese monastic history, 600\u20131300|url=http://libro.uca.edu/monastic/monastic.htm|year=1984|publisher=Variorum Reprints|location=London|isbn=0-86078-136-4|pages=1\u201343}}</ref> Fructuosus was later consecrated as abbot-bishop of [[Dumio]], the most important monastery of Gallaecia\u2014founded by Martin of Braga in the 6th century\u2014under Suebi rule. In 656 he was appointed bishop of Braga and metropolitan of Galicia, ostensibly against his own will.\n\nDuring his later years the Visigothic monarchy suffered a pronounced decline, due in large part to a decrease in trade and therefore a sharp reduction in [[monetary]] circulation, largely as a result of the Muslim occupations in the early 8th century in the south [[Mediterranean]]. The Gallaecia were also affected, and Fructuosus of Braga denounced the general cultural decline and loss of the momentum from previous periods, causing some discontent in the Galician high clergy. At the tenth [[Council of Toledo]] in 656, Fructuosus was appointed to the Metropolitan seat of Potamio after the renunciation of its previous occupier. At the same time the [[Will (law)|Will]] of the Bishop of Dume Recimiro was declared [[Void (law)|void]] after he donated the wealth of the [[diocese]] [[convent]] to the poor.\n\nThe crisis at the end of the Visigoth era dates to the reign of [[Egica]]. The monarch appointed his son [[Wittiza]] as his heir, and despite the fact that the Visigothic monarchy had been traditionally [[Election|elective]] rather than [[hereditary]] Egica associated Wittiza during his lifetime to the throne (for example, Egica and Wittiza are known to have issued coinage with the confronted effigies of both monarchs). In 701 an outbreak of [[Plague (disease)|plague]] spread westward from [[Greece]] to Spain, reaching [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], the Visigothic capital, in the same year, and having such impact that the royal family, including Egica and Wittiza, fled. It has been suggested<ref>Roger Collins (2004), ''Visigothic Spain, 409\u2013711''. (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing.), 110. {{ISBN|0-631-18185-7}}.</ref> that this provided the occasion for sending Wittiza to rule the Kingdom of the Suevi from [[Tui, Galicia|Tui]],<ref>As assumed by the 10th century ''[[Chronicle of Alfonso III]]''.</ref> which is recorded as his capital. The possibility has also been raised that the 13th-century chronicler, [[Lucas of Tuy]], when he records that Wittiza relieved the oppression of the Jews (a fact unknown from his reign at Toledo after his father), may in fact refer to his reign at Lucas' hometown of Tui, where an oral tradition may have been preserved of the events of his Galician reign.<ref>Bernard S. Bachrach (1973), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1853939 \"A Reassessment of Visigothic Jewish Policy, 589\u2013711.\"] ''[[The American Historical Review]]'', '''78''':1 (Feb.), pp 31\u201332. Lucas' account has a large number of both detractors (Graetz, Katz, and Dahn) and supporters (Scherer, Ziegler, and Altamira) and even if true it is possible that Lucas' story is based on the minutes of [[XVIII Toledo]], which still survived in his time.</ref>\n\nIn 702, with the death of Egica, Wittiza as sole king moved his capital to [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. In 710, part of the Visigothic aristocracy violently raised [[Roderic]] to the throne, triggering a civil war with the supporters of Wittiza and his sons. In 711, the enemies of [[Roderic]] got a Muslim army to cross the [[Straits of Gibraltar]] and face him at the [[Battle of Guadalete]]. The defeat was the end of Roderic and of the Visigothic rule, with profound consequences for the whole of the Iberian peninsula.\n\n==Early and High Middle Ages==\n[[File:Theodemirus.JPG|thumb|left|Tombstone of the [[sepulcher]] of bishop [[Theodemar of Iria]] (d. 847), discoverer of the tomb attributed to apostle [[Saint James the Great]]]]\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 87%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:23em; max-width: 25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n\"Alfonso king of Galicia and of Asturias, after having ravaged Lisbon, the last city of Spain, sent during the winter the insignias of his victory, breastplates, mules, and Moor prisoners, through his legates Froia and Basiliscus.\" [[Annales regni Francorum]], c 798.<ref>[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/annalesregnifrancorum.html at the Latin Library.]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n\"And so, as I've been told, when Adefonsus departed of this world, as Nepotianus usurped the kingdom of [[Ramiro I of Asturias|Ramiro]], Ramiro went to the city of Lugo in Galicia, and there he reunited the army of the whole province.

Along with the rest of the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula, it was free of Arab presence from the mid-8th century, being gradually incorporated into a growing Christian state.

This role was assumed by the rural north during the Early and High Middle Ages, as a consequence not only of the Islamic invasion, but as the final result of a continental wide urban crisis.\n\nThe old bishoprics of Braga, Ourense, Tui, Lamego, and others, were either discontinued, or re-established in the north, under the protection of Lugo\u2014which was now a stronghold due to its Roman walls\u2014and [[Iria Flavia]]. [[Dumio]] was re-established by the [[Bay of Biscay]] in [[Mondo\u00f1edo]], Lugo assumed the role of Braga, and the bishops of Lamego and Tui sought refugee in Iria, where they received generous territorial grants. During the 9th, 10th, and 11th centuries most of these bishoprics were re-established in their historical sees, but at this time the bishops of Lugo, Mondo\u00f1edo, and Iria became major political players; not just as religious figures, but also as wealthy, and sometimes mighty secular powers. In particular, the bishops of Iria and [[Santiago de Compostela|Compostela]] were notorious [[warlord]]s,<ref>The [[Historia Compostellana]] of the 12th century records a popular proverb: \"Bishop of Santiago: Staff and Crossbow\" (HC, II.1)</ref> due to the many fortresses and military resources they controlled as heads of a military [[Normans|Norman]] mark,<ref>The presence of Norman (Viking) raiders by the coasts of Galicia is constant during much of the 9th, 10th and 11th centuries; even a bishop, Sisenand II, was killed while fighting them, in the Battle of Fornelos, in 977.

Rights to the tax collection and government of each territory was granted by the [[titular ruler]]\u2014usually the king\u2014to a [[count]], bishopric, or large monastery, although there existed some singularities. The bishopric of Lugo was divided into counties, each one under the government of an ''infanzon'' (a lesser nobleman) as a concession of the bishop, while in the south, large and mighty territories such as the ''Portucalense'' became hereditary, passed down to the descendants of the 9th century's conquerors. In the ''Terra de Santiago'' (Land of Saint James, the fief of the bishops of Iria-Compostela) each territory was administered by a bishop's vicar, while justice was administered by a council composed of representatives of the local churchmen, knights, and peasants.<ref>L\u00f3pez Ferreiro (1895) pp. 155\u2013165.</ref>\n\nEach territory or county could be further divided into ''mandationes'' and ''decanias''. The basic territorial division was the ''villa'', centered on a church, and composed of one or more hamlets or villages, together with all its facilities, lands, and possessions. The ''villas'' perpetuated ancient Roman and Suevic foundations, and they were the base for the ecclesiastical organization, and for the economic production of the country, later evolving into the modern ''parroquias'' and ''freguesias'' (rural parishes). The local economy was [[List of subsistence techniques|subsistence]], based mainly on the production of grain and beans, and notably in cattle breeding.<ref>The modern Galician, Portuguese and Spanish words for cattle (''gando, gado, ganado'', respectively) derive from a term meaning ''per se'' \u2013 \"the earned thing\".</ref> Other valuable\u2014though geographically restricted\u2014products included fruits, salt, wine, honey, [[olive oil]], horses, iron for the production of weapons and tools, and exotic oriental fabrics introduced from ''[[Muslim Spain|Spania]]''. There were also specialized [[artisan]]s who worked on demand, such as [[masonry|masons]] and [[goldsmith]]s.\n\nWhile local commerce was common, long range interchanges\u2014generally maintained by [[Hebrew]] merchants\u2014were rare and appreciated. Monetary circulation was scarce, composed mainly of old Suebi and Visigothic coinage known locally as ''solidos gallicianos''. War and pillaging against the thriving Al-Andalus was also a very important source for the acquisition of riches, exotic items, and Muslim serfs. Later, pilgrimage of Christians from all over Europe to [[Santiago de Compostela]] brought not only riches, but also a range of continental innovations and trends, from [[shipbuilding]], to new [[architectural styles]] such as [[Romanesque art]].\n\n[[File:San Marti\u00f1o de Mondo\u00f1edo-Foz(Lugo).jpg|right|thumb|Romanesque cathedral of San Marti\u00f1o de Mondo\u00f1edo (9th\u201311th centuries); first construction dates from the 6th\u20137th centuries]]\nThe elites were composed of counts, [[duke]]s, ''senatores'', and other high noblemen, who were frequently related by marriage with the monarch,<ref>During the High Middle Ages not unusually a king would refer to a Galician nobleman or to a noblewoman as uncle or aunt.</ref> and who usually claimed the most powerful positions in society, either as governors, bishops, or as [[palatine]] officials or companions of the king or queen. The Galician nobility however were also frequently found as rebels, either as supporters of a different candidate to the throne, or aspiring to it themselves, or simply as disobedient to the king's orders and will.<ref>For instance, the list of the rebels against Alfonso III include in Galicia noblemen such as count Froila Lemundi, who was briefly king; duke Uittiza in southern Galicia, who resisted for seven years; count Flacidio in Lugo; the brothers Aldreto and Flacencius again in Lugo; Oduarius in the east; Hermegildo and Iberia in the west... Cf.  Bali\u00f1as P\u00e9rez (1998) pp. 104\u2013107.</ref> At the service of the noblemen were ''miles'' ([[knight]]s) and ''infanzones''; they were often found marching to war with their subalterns on behalf of a patron, or as vicars and administrators.\n\nA sizable section of the society were [[churchmen]]\u2014[[presbyters]], deacons, clergymen, ''lectors'', ''confessos'', monks, and nuns\u2014who frequently lived in [[religious communities]], some of which were composed of both men and women living under [[Vow of chastity|vows of chastity]] and [[Vow of poverty|poverty]]. Most of these monasteries were directed by an [[abbot]] or [[abbess]], ruled under a pactual tradition heavily influenced by Germanic legal traditions,<ref>Cf. Bishko (1984).</ref> with a bishop ''sub regula'' as the highest authority of the community. Other monasteries used different, sometimes antagonist rules. The [[Benedictine]] and [[Augustine]] rules were uncommon until the 11th century. As in most of Europe, the [[chartulary]] and [[chronicle]] proceedings of monasteries and bishoprics are the most important source for the study of local history.<ref>In Galicia the most important chartularies for the Early and High Middle Ages are those from the monasteries of Sobrado, with documents from the 8th\u201313th centuries, Celanova (9th\u201313th), Samos (8th\u201313th)&nbsp;...  And of the cathedrals of Santiago and Lugo, with documents dated from the 8th century. In Portugal the most notable documentation for the period was edited and published by [[Alexandre Herculano]] in the 19th century, under the title ''[[Portugaliae Monumenta Historica]]''.</ref>\n\nBy the 12th century the only known [[bourgeois]] were the [[Multiethnic|multinational]] inhabitants of Compostela, by this stage a fortified and strong city. Meanwhile, the City Council of Santiago for centuries had struggled against their bishops for the recognition of a number of liberties. In the country, most people were [[Serfdom#Freemen|freemen]], peasants, artisans, or [[infantrymen]], who could freely choose a patron, or buy and sell properties, although they frequently fell prey to the greed of the big owners, leading many of them to a life of [[Slavery|servitude]]. Finally, ''servos'', ''libertos'', and ''pueros'' ([[serf]]s and [[slave]]s), either obtained in war with the [[Moors]] or through trial, constituted a visible part of the society; they were employed as household workers (''domesticos'' and ''scancianes''), [[shepherd]]s, and [[farmhand]]s. Local charters also show that, in time, they were freed.<ref>For instance, in the 10th century Saint Rudesind freed his Muslim governess, granting her a series of properties, together with 'Roman citizenship'.</ref>\n\nIn terms of religion, most were Roman Catholics, although the local rites\u2014known today as [[Mozarabic rite]]s\u2014were notably different from those used in most of Western Europe. No Arian, [[Priscillianist]], or [[Pagan]] organizations are known to have survived during the High Middle Ages.<ref>For the pagan survivals: Cf. Stephen McKenna (1938) [http://libro.uca.edu/mckenna/paganism.htm ''Paganism and Pagan Survivals in Spain up to the Fall of the Visigothic Kingdom ''].</ref> However, there were still pagans and pagan shrines in the [[Bierzo]] region during the 7th century, whilst Arian or Priscillianist [[tonsure]]\u2014seen as long hair, with only a partial tonsure atop the head\u2014was in use in Galicia up to 681, when it was forbidden at a council in Toledo. There were no known Muslim communities in Galicia and northern Portugal, other than Moor serfs. Records of [[Hebrew people]] are also uncommon in local charters until the 12th century, except as travelers and merchants.<ref>''Pace'' {{cite book|last=Onega|first=Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n|title=Los jud\u00edos en el reino de Galicia|year=1999|publisher=Editora Nacional|location=Madrid|isbn=84-931225-1-3|edition=2.}}</ref>\n\nPersonal names in Galicia and northern Portugal were chiefly of Germanic origin, although Christian, Roman, and Greek names were also common. Names were usually composed just of a single surname, although noblemen frequently also used a [[patronymic]].

At the death of Garc\u00eda in 914, Ordo\u00f1o also acquired Le\u00f3n, and on his death in 924 his younger brother, Fruela, reunited Alfonso's realm. Fruela's death a year later initiated a period of chaos, with several claimants to the crown. Fruela's son, [[Alfonso Fr\u00f3ilaz]], received support from Asturias, but was captured and blinded by [[Sancho I Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez|Sancho]], [[Alfonso IV of Le\u00f3n|Alfonso IV]], and [[Ramiro II of Le\u00f3n|Ramiro II]], sons of Ordo\u00f1o, with the aid of the [[Basque people|Basque]] troops of [[Jimeno Garc\u00e9s of Pamplona]].

This was not the case when Ordo\u00f1o was succeeded by his half-brother [[Sancho I of Le\u00f3n]] in 956. Sancho proved unpopular and ineffectual and the Galician nobles grew fractious, forming a coalition with [[Fern\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez of Castile]] to overthrow Sancho in favor of [[Ordo\u00f1o IV of Le\u00f3n|Ordo\u00f1o IV]], who was enthroned in Santiago de Compostela in 958.<ref>Portela Silva (2001) p. 165.</ref> However Sancho reclaimed the crown in 960 with support from his mother's [[Kingdom of Pamplona]], the Leonese nobility, and Muslim assistance.<ref>After returning to the throne he frequently spoke of his \"returning back from Spain\": ''\"Era DCCCCa LXLVIII anno regni nostri quarto & de adventu Spanie secundo\"'', ([https://books.google.com/books?ct=result&id=Jd_m6RMiSRwC&dq=sahagun&q=spania#v=onepage&q&f=false document from the Monastery of Sahag\u00fan]).

When the [[Count of Castile]]\u2014nominally a Leonese [[vassal]], but ''de facto'' independent\u2014was assassinated in Le\u00f3n in 1029, Sancho claimed the right to name the successor, giving it to his own son [[Ferdinand I of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Ferdinand]]. Taking advantage of the youth of Leonese king [[Bermudo III of Le\u00f3n|Bermudo III]], Sancho seized disputed border regions, formalizing the arrangement by including the lands in the dowry of Bermudo's sister, who was married to Ferdinand in 1032. Two years later, in 1034, Sancho took Bermudo's capital, becoming ''de facto'' ruler of most of the kingdom, whilst leaving Bermudo to rule from his refuge in Galicia. Sancho's death the next year allowed Bermudo to regain not only the entire kingdom, but to briefly become overlord of Ferdinand's Castile. However, in 1037, the Castilian count killed Bermudo in battle, and Galicia passed with the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n into the hands of Ferdinand, who then had himself crowned king.\n\n[[File:Europe-south-west-kingdoms.png|thumb|right|Political situation in the Northern [[Iberian Peninsula]] around 1065:\n{{legend|#ba7f45|[[Garc\u00eda II of Galicia|Garcia II]]'s domains (Galicia)}}\n{{legend|#68ae94|Badajoz, owing tribute to Garcia}}\n{{legend|#329ca7|Seville, owing tribute to Garcia}}\n{{legend|#c2a541|[[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Alfonso VI]]'s domains (Le\u00f3n)}}\n{{legend|#88a756|Toledo, owing tribute to Alfonso}}\n{{legend|#dcc983|[[Sancho II of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Sancho II]]'s domains (Castile)}}\n{{legend|#c0bf78|Zaragoza, owing tribute to Sancho}}]]\n\nFerdinand's death in 1065 led to another short-lived Galician state.

While besieging this town in 1072, Sancho was assassinated, inducing Alfonso to return and claim the entire realm.

Both Burgundians were close allies in the affairs of the realm, ratifying a pact of friendship where Raymond promised his cousin to give to him the Kingdom of Toledo or the Kingdom of Galicia, together with a third of his treasure, in return for Henry's aid in acquiring the crown as successor of King Alfonso.<ref>Reilly (1982) p. 27.</ref> However, by 1097 King Alfonso granted Henry the counties of [[County of Portugal|Portugal]] and [[County of Coimbra|Coimbra]], from the river [[Minho River|Minho]] to the [[Tagus]],<ref name=\"Reilly 1982 p. 29\">Reilly (1982) p. 29.</ref> thus limiting the powers of Raymond, who by this time was securing an important nucleus of partisans in Galicia, including [[Pedro Fr\u00f3ilaz de Traba|Count Pedro Fr\u00f3ilaz de Traba]], whilst appointing his own notary, [[Diego Gelm\u00edrez]], as bishop of Compostela. In successive years he also obtained the government of Zamora, Salamanca, and [[\u00c1vila, Spain|\u00c1vila]],<ref name=\"Reilly 1982 p. 29\"/> but he died in 1107, two years before King Alfonso, who was now in his seventies. The government of Galicia and their other possessions was retained by Alfonso's widow, Urraca, who styled herself Mistress and Empress of Galicia.<ref>''totius Gallecie domina'' (Santiago,  1107), ''tocius Gallecie imperatrix'' (Lugo, 1108). Cf. Reilly (1982) p. 48, 50.</ref> King Alfonso, in a council held in Le\u00f3n, asked of the magnates of Galicia to swear an oath on the defense of the rights of his grandson, Alfonso Raim\u00fandez, to the kingdom of Galicia, in case his mother Urraca remarried.<ref>Reilly (1982) p. 49.</ref>\n\nOn June 30, 1109, King Alfonso VI died. He was succeeded by Queen Urraca, who remarried in 1109 to the king of Aragon, [[Alfonso the Battler]], a soldier by nature who was immediately received as king in Castille and Le\u00f3n, but not in Galicia. As part of the marriage settlement, any children born to the union were to have priority over Raymond's son Alfonso in the succession. In Galicia this union was rejected by the old party of count Raymond, now led by count Pedro Fr\u00f3ilaz, tutor of young Alfonso, although the partisans of Urraca also joined forces.<ref>Villaca\u00f1as Berlanga (2006) p. 361.</ref> With Leon and Castille quiet and under control, Alfonso moved on Galicia in 1110, and while he did not suffer any major defeat, he had little success, returning three months later to Le\u00f3n. Probably as a consequence to this development, Pedro Froila drew Diego Gelmirez to his party. In 1111, the young Alfonso Raim\u00fandez was crowned and anointed king in Compostela.<ref>Villaca\u00f1as Berlanga (2006) p. 363.</ref>\n\n===Separation of the County of Portugal (1128)===\n[[File:Europe-south-west-kingdoms12th.png|thumb|right|Political Map of the northwest Iberian peninsula at the end of the 12th century]]\nOn the death of Henry in 1112, his widow Theresa succeeded him as head of the two Counties of Portugal and Coimbra, during the minority of her son, [[Afonso Henriques]]. Two trends emerged at this time, firstly a policy of rapprochement with the new King [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Alfonso VII]], and secondly the maintenance of their power with the aim that the heir to the county would be proclaimed king. The increasing importance of [[Santiago de Compostela]]\u2014now [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan church]] of [[Lusitania]], which was in open competition with Braga, metropolitan church of Galicia\u2014and the support for Theresa's rule north of the Minho brought about by her romantic union with [[Fernando P\u00e9rez de Traba]] altered the ''status quo''. The Archbishop of Braga, who had suffered the nocturnal theft of the [[relic]]s of Fructuosus of Braga by [[Diego Gelmirez]] in 1102,<ref>Fletcher (1984) p. 115.</ref> and the major Portuguese aristocrats who were pursuing a larger territorial authority, gave support to the royal pretensions of [[Afonso Henriques]]. Given this situation, King Alfonso VII marched on Portugal, taking first Tui and other territories north of the river Minho, later besieging [[Guimar\u00e3es]] and obtaining the submission of the Portuguese.<ref>Gonz\u00e1lez L\u00f3pez (1978) pp. 231\u2013236.</ref>\n\nSeveral months later, in 1128, inspired by the shortcomings of Afonso Henriques, the Galician and Portuguese troops of Theresa and Fernando Perez de Trava entered Portugal, but the men of Afonso scored a decisive victory at the [[Battle of S\u00e3o Mamede]]. The later death of Theresa, and Afonso's success against the Moors at the [[Battle of Ourique]], led to him being proclaimed King of the Portuguese in 1139, this independence being recognized at the [[Treaty of Zamora]] in 1143. Still, the statute of frontier lands such as [[Toro\u00f1o]] and [[Limia, Spain|Limia]] in southern Galicia led to frequent border conflicts during most of the Lower Middle Ages.<ref>Gonz\u00e1lez L\u00f3pez (1978) pp. 237\u2013247.</ref>\n\n===Compostelan Era (1111\u20131230)===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 87%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:23em; max-width: 25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | '''Excerpts from the ''[[Historia Compostelana]]'''''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''The laws, the rights, the peace, the justice, called the Galician to arms; everything which is wrong threw the Aragonese into every kind of crime.''

Calixtus II did not approve Gelmirez's claims, but finally decided to enlarge Compostela's jurisdiction into an anomalous situation in which Compostela exercised power not over its geographical location of the Galician territories, but over the old jurisdiction of [[M\u00e9rida, Spain|M\u00e9rida]], the old metropolitan church of Lusitania, which was then under Muslim control without a bishop.<ref>Gonz\u00e1lez L\u00f3pez (1978) p. 219-223.</ref> Consequently, the bishops of Coimbra, Lamego, Viseu, or Salamanca, among others, were subjected to the rule of Compostela.

L\u00f3pez Carreira (1999) pp. 242\u2013266.</ref>\n\nThroughout this century there was also a rapid growth of the rural population, resulting in a larger force of farm labor which consequently allowed the great monasteries to develop new agricultural lands. This, coupled with the improvement of farming equipment and techniques, such as the introduction of the heavy wheeled [[plough]], resulted in an increase in [[productivity]] that impacted the people's lifestyles. The distribution of this increased productivity between peasants and lords was regulated by the establishment of ''foros'' or lifelong contracts, frequently spanning several generations or ''vozes''. The economic and social transformations led to profound changes in mindset. In the towns, it initiated a religious and intellectual renewal under the [[mendicant]] orders, most notably the [[Franciscans]], who instituted social reforms.\n\nCompostela, \"capital and looking glass\" of the Kingdom of Galicia, became a showcase of this thriving era, reflected in Master Matthew's work in the granite of the [[Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]]\u2014especially in the ''Portico da Gloria'' and in Prateria's fa\u00e7ade\u2014demonstrating a prosperity also witnessed through the numerous surviving Romanesque buildings in Galicia.

While marriage of royals had resulted in the union of some of these states\u2014for example between Navarre and Aragon, and Castile and Le\u00f3n\u2014subsequent divisions amongst heirs created a dynamic pattern of union and separation. However, the 12th century initiated a series of unions that would prove permanent.\n\nAlfonso IX married twice. From his first marriage to [[Theresa of Portugal, Queen of Le\u00f3n|Teresa of Portugal]] he had a son, Ferdinand, and two daughters, Sancha and Aldonza. From his second marriage to [[Berengaria of Castile]], he had five children; Eleanor, who died as a child, a second [[Ferdinand III of Castile|Ferdinand]], [[Alfonso of Molina|Alfonso]], [[Berengaria of Le\u00f3n|Berengaria]], and Constance. The death of Alfonso IX's son from his first marriage, Ferdinand, in 1214 left the younger Ferdinand, from his second marriage, as heir to his father. When the Castilian king, [[Henry I of Castile|Henry I]], died in 1217 and Berengaria ceded her rights to her son, Ferdinand became King of Castile, against the will of his father.<ref>Gonz\u00e1lez L\u00f3pez (1978) p. 361.</ref>\n\nTo preserve the independence of his realm, Alfonso IX applied customary Galician-Leonese inheritance to nominate Aldonza as future Queen of Galicia, and Sancha as Queen of Le\u00f3n, enlisting their uncle [[Afonso II of Portugal]] to support their succession.<ref>Cf. Gonz\u00e1lez L\u00f3pez (1978) p. 360, where he anyway just mentions the Galician [[consuetudinary]] laws which equates the rights of women and men.</ref> Alfonso died in 1230 in Sarria, while on pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela to thank the apostle for his help in the conquest of Extremadura, and his body was taken there for burial.<ref>Gonz\u00e1lez L\u00f3pez (1978) p. 286.</ref> Most of the Leonese nobility cleaved to Ferdinand, who also gained the support of the new Portuguese king, [[Sancho II of Portugal|Sancho II]]. After clashes in Le\u00f3n and Galicia, Alfonso IX's two former wives, Berengaria and Theresa, reached an agreement whereby Theresa induced Aldonza and Sancha to abandon their regal claims in exchange for an [[annuity (finance theory)|annuity]].<ref>Cf. Gonz\u00e1lez L\u00f3pez (1978) p. 360-366.</ref> As a result, Ferdinand III became successor to Alfonso's kingdoms of Le\u00f3n and Galicia, bringing about a permanent union into what would come to be called the [[Crown of Castile]], wherein the kingdoms continued as administrative entities under the unified rule of a single monarch.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"140\" class=\"center\" caption=\"Royal pantheon of the [[Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]]\">\nFile:PC190465.JPG|alt=Pedro Fr\u00f3ilaz de Traba|Sepulcher of count [[Pedro Fr\u00f3ilaz de Traba]] (''Orbem Galletie Imperante''), protector of king [[Alfonso VII]] (d. 1128)\nFile:Lauda de Fernando II.jpg|alt=Ferdinand II|Sepulcher of king [[Ferdinand II of Le\u00f3n|Ferdinand II]] (''Rex in Legione et Gallecia'') (d. 1187)\nFile:Fernando Afonso.jpg|alt=Ferdinand of Galicia and Le\u00f3n|Sepulcher of [[Ferdinand of Le\u00f3n (died 1214)|Ferdinand of Galicia and Le\u00f3n]].

The death of his eldest son [[Ferdinand de la Cerda]] led Ferdinand's younger brother, [[Sancho IV of Castile|Sancho]], to rebel in a bid to secure the succession, which was ultimately successful. A similar pattern then followed Sancho's own death in 1295, with the reign of his juvenile son [[Ferdinand IV of Castile]] being contested by his uncle [[John of Castile, Lord of Valencia de Campos|John]], who had been in revolt since 1286.<ref>Gonz\u00e1lez L\u00f3pez (1978) pp. 406\u2013415.</ref>\n\nWith the help of King [[Denis I of Portugal]], John\u2014who lived exiled in Granada\u2014advanced to Badajoz as pretender to the throne of Castile, but negotiations with Ferdinand's party, together with the assassination of his closest ally the ''adelantado mayor'' of Galicia Paio G\u00f3mez Charinho, led him to renounce to this goal.<ref>Gonz\u00e1lez L\u00f3pez (1978) pp. 415\u2013416.</ref> Anyway, in 1296 [[John of Castile, Lord of Valencia de Campos|John]] took the lead of the nobility of the old Leonese crown, and with the support of the kings of Aragon and Portugal was proclaimed king of Le\u00f3n and Galicia in 1296, a claim which also included the Kingdom of Seville, historically a vassal of Galicia since the 11th century. Charinho was succeeded by Fernando Ru\u00edz de Castro, a kinsman of the house of Traba, whose wife also supported John and was the source of political activity calling for a rapprochement with Portugal.<ref>Gonz\u00e1lez L\u00f3pez (1978) pp. 419\u2013420.</ref>\n\nThis attempted secession lasted five years amid great political and military instability due to opposition from many sectors of society, as well as the party of Sancho's widow [[Maria de Molina]], supported by the Castilian nobility, and the high Galician clergy. Faced with this resistance, King Dom Denis of Portugal proposed to Queen Maria de Molina that [[John of Castile, Lord of Valencia de Campos|John]] should held for him and for his heirs the Kingdom of Galicia, where he counted with the strong support of Fernando Ruiz de Castro and other noblemen, thus granting him the title of King.<ref>\"E en el pleito avianle tratado e puesto de esta manera, que diesen luego al infante Don Juan todo el reino de Galicia, e que se llamase ende Rey\", ''Cr\u00f3nica General del Rey Don Fernando IV'', cap IV, in Gonz\u00e1lez L\u00f3pez (1978) pp. 422\u2013423.</ref> In 1301, after losing the support of the King of Portugal, John was forced to abandon his claim to sovereignty in exchange for a number of minor titles, thus confirming the unity of the Crown of Castile.\n\n===Unrest in the cities===\n[[File:Castelo da Rocha forte 1.JPG|thumb|left|Ruins of the castle of ''A Rocha Forte'', torn down in 1467 by the ''[[Irmandi\u00f1o]]s''.

This unrest was not new, as Compostela had known bloody conflicts of the bourgeois and the bishops since the first years of the 12th century, in times of Gelmirez, when the bishop himself was chased inside the city.<ref>His flight was itself an astonishing Hollywood story, narrated in the ''Historia Compostellana'', I.114\u2013116.</ref> In these conflicts, Don Felipe and the local nobility usually supported the councils' pretensions in opposition to the mighty and rich bishops,<ref>Garcia Oro (1987) vol.

As a result, in 1354 a coalition of nobles rose in defence of a pactual monarchy,<ref name=\"Garcia Oro 1987, vol. I, 103\">Garcia Oro 1987, vol. I, 103.</ref> although this coalition was soon discontinued.\n\nHenry, illegitimate son of [[Alfonso XI of Castile]] and half-brother of Peter, took advantage of the dissatisfaction among the noblemen to launch a war against Peter, with the support of [[Peter IV of Aragon]], with whom Peter was already at war, and along companies of [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] such as that commanded by [[Bertrand du Guesclin]]. Meanwhile, Peter drew his support from the municipalities and part of the nobility, most notably the Galician Castro family headed by Fernando Rodrigues de Castro, ''Pertegueiro Maior'' of Santiago and ''Adelantado Mayor'' of Galicia, who after defecting Henry in 1355<ref name=\"Garcia Oro 1987, vol.

Other notable supporters were Sueiro Eans Parada, Men Rodrigues de Seabra, and the Moscoso family.\n\nIn 1366 Pedro was forced to flee into Andalusia, while Fernando de Castro routed to Galicia. After a dangerous journey through Portugal, King Pedro made it to Galicia, where an assembly of supporters decided to send him into [[Gascony]], looking for English support,<ref>Garcia Oro 1987, vol.

However, the entry of England's enemy [[Charles V of France]] on Henry's side had a destabilising effect. In 1369 the new archbishop of Santiago, the loyalist Rodrigo de Moscoso, ordered his knights to march urgently into Andalusia on the support of the King and of Fernando de Castro, but the call was ignored.<ref>''It's precise that you come immediately and as fast as you can'' (\u00abCompre que ve\u00f1ades logo et o mais a presa que poderdes\u00bb).

The insurgents usually were organized in ''[[Hermandad|irmandades]]'' (meaning 'brotherhoods'), groups of men who in exceptional circumstances, and allegedly with the king's approval, armed themselves to act as policemen in defence of peace and justice.\n\nA brotherhood was established in Compostela in 1418, taking advantage of the temporal absence of the archbishop, and violently taking hold of the city in 1422, overruling the city council. Another one, called ''Fusquenlla'' or 'The Mad Brotherhood', rose up in the north of the kingdom against the House of [[Andrade]]. The armies of the brotherhood, directed by the lesser nobleman Roi Xordo, were finally defeated by the Andrade's armies by the gates of Compostela in 1431. Later, in 1453, the troops of the bishop of Ourense and that of the council of the city fought fiercely for the possession of the local castles, even using ''tronos'' (cannons, literally 'thunders'), and forcing the bishop into the exile.<ref>L\u00f3pez Carreira 1999, 299\u2013302.</ref> In 1458 a brotherhood was established bringing together some important noblemen (the House of Moscoso, the House of Estrada, and Sueiro Gomes de Soutomaior among others) and the cities and towns of Compostela, [[Noia]], and [[Muros, A Coru\u00f1a|Muros]], against the archbishop of Santiago, who was first caught as a prisoner, being kept and paraded in a cage for two years, later being banished for ten years after their supporters had paid an onerous rescue. Similar revolts were producing all over the kingdom, in [[Betanzos]], [[Viveiro]], [[Lugo]] and [[Allariz]]. All of these Galician brotherhoods acted autonomously, sometimes even against King's will and direct orders.<ref>Barros Guimer\u00e1ns 1988, 39\u201345.</ref>\n\nIn 1465 the Crown of Castile was again in crisis, with King [[Henry IV of Castile|Henry IV]] under siege by Castilian noblemen who were supporting an aristocratic candidate to the throne. Henry reacted sending letters all around the realm, calling for the establishment of brotherhoods to defend the ''status quo''. From 1465 to 1467 local brotherhoods were organized all over Galicia, gaining the adhesion of churchmen, artisans, peasants, and some noblemen.<ref>Barros Guimer\u00e1ns 1988, 94.</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1467 a General Council of the Kingdom of Galicia (''Junta General do Reyno de Galizia'') was held in [[Melide, A Coru\u00f1a|Melide]]. After an angry debate it was decided that noblemen should deliver all of their strongholds and castles to the officials of the ''Irmandade'', resulting in many assistant noblemen fleeing to exile, while others resisted the armies of the ''Irmandi\u00f1os'' ('little brothers'), only to be slowly beaten back into Castile and Portugal;<ref name=\"Carlos Barros: Xunta\">{{cite web|last=Barros Guimer\u00e1ns|first=Carlos|title=As orixes medievais da Xunta de Galicia|url=http://www.h-debate.com/cbarros/spanish/xunta.htm|accessdate=June 4, 2011}}</ref> as described by a contemporary, 'the sparrows pursued the falcons'.<ref>Garcia Oro, vol.

General Councils of the Kingdom were later held in [[Betanzos]] and Santiago de Compostela in 1467, in Lugo in 1468, and in Ourense in 1469. But in autumn of 1469 the exiled noblemen, joining forces, marched into Galicia: Pedro Alvares de Soutomaior entered from Portugal with gunmen and mercenaries; the archbishop Fonseca of Compostela from Zamora; and the Count of Lemos from [[Ponferrada]]. Meanwhile, other noblemen who had resisted inside the Kingdom also pushed forward.

In practice this resulted in the disappearance of the European empire of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] and the idea of a universal Catholic monarchy. Ferdinand was declared [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and king of [[Hungary]] and [[Bohemia]], while Philip inherited the [[Netherlands]], [[Naples]] and [[Sicily]], the [[Crown of Aragon]] and Castile, including the Kingdom of Galicia.\n\nThe 42-year reign of Philip II was noted from the beginning by war\u2014against the Netherlands, France, England, Portugal and the [[Ottoman Empire]]\u2014motivated by the personal ambition of the monarch, who tried not only to avoid the loss of his domains, but to expand it.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} He created a battlefield across the Atlantic and northern Europe that had not only disastrous consequences for the Galician economy, but also for the society and people of the Kingdom of Galicia.\n\n[[File:Invincible Armada.jpg|thumb|left|Battle between the naval fleets of Philip II of Habsburg (nicknamed the \"Invincible Armada\") and Elizabeth I of England in 1588, leaving the English victorious]]\nWith his private crusade against the [[Lutheran]]s, the Catholic monarchy prevented the participation of the Kingdom of Galicia in the three most important revolutionary processes of the age, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], the opening up of the [[New World]], and the [[Scientific revolution]]. In 1562, Philip II deployed the Holy Office, via the [[Spanish Inquisition]], in the Kingdom of Galicia, after the failure of Charles V's attempts to do so due to the opposition of the Galician clergy.\n\nThe Inquisition was an instrument of cultural and religious repression without precedent, which began operating in Portugal from 1575, led by the Castilian Inquisitor Quijano del Mercado. The Inquisition's stated aim was to prevent the \"contamination\" of the Kingdom of Galicia by the reformist ideas of the Lutherans, which arrived in Galicia via English, Dutch and French traders. This situation also had serious commercial consequences, because one of the tasks of the Inquisition was to review the [[merchant ship]]s, requiring them to receive visitation rights and condemning to be [[burned at the stake]] any sailors likely to be . The Inquisition even went as far as proposing the closure of all Galician seaports to avoid religious assimilation. Such measures eventually exceeded the patience of the inhabitants of cities like A Coru\u00f1a, where in 1589 the city requested the end of inquisitorial activity at the seaport due to the serious reduction of maritime traffic in the city in this period.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 87%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:23em; max-width: 25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n\"Rodrigo Montero, cleric, priest and rector of the Fort of San Felipe&nbsp;... declared that&nbsp;... the armies of the King our Lord (Philip II), have stayed here in winter and summer in the seaport town of Ferrol&nbsp;... have done great harms to the residents of the town of Ferrol&nbsp;... as they (the Spanish troops) took the houses where Ferrol people lived and the troops forced them to leave it and look for others&nbsp;... troops have removed and cut the vines and breaking civilian's walls&nbsp;... also razed and felled the forests and wood in people's forests&nbsp;... took by force the boats to the inhabitants of the said town of Ferrol and the troops forced them to recruit and work for them without payment&nbsp;... these services didn't allow the Ferrol's men go fishing and feed their wives and children and&nbsp;... the troops also ate and destroyed the fruits of their trees and cabbages, vegetables and turnips and more lelgumbres of their orchards&nbsp;... stole them also wood tabals from the civilians houses got repairing their vessels and the benefit of the said vessels&nbsp;... |- (Rodrigo Montero, September 2, 1603)\n|}\n\nPhilip II's reign saw the continuation of the expulsion of the Jews from May 30, 1492, [[Language|linguistic]] persecution (from 1566 the adoption of Castilian was enforced, and the use of [[Arabic]] was punished by the Crown), and religious persecutions effectively constituted [[ethnic cleansing]]. For example, in [[Alpujarra]] in the [[Kingdom of Granada]] in 1568, which was at the time led by self-proclaimed Granadian king Muhammad ibn Umayya, was ordered the forced dispersal of 80,000 Granadian Muslims throughout the realm, and the introduction of Christians in their place. Thousands of Galician families were sent to Granada for that purpose between the years 1572\u201377, with many of them dying in the process.\n\nIn the field of war, the militarization motivated by the war against the Netherlands, which was largely a strategic battle used to garner support for the crown, contrasted with the lack of defence in Galicia resulting from the Catholic Monarchs removing the Galician strongholds to prevent a revolt of the kingdom. Thus, in 1580 the Board of the Kingdom of Galicia requested troops for Philip II to defend the coast, just months after a strong military recruitment had taken place. However these troops were not used to protect the kingdom, but instead to attack Portugal in to try to put Philip on the Portuguese throne.\n\nDespite claims to the contrary, the military campaign against Portugal was not carried out by professional soldiers billeted at A Coru\u00f1a, Ferrol, or Baiona, and was not paid by the crown, but was rather conducted by ill-equipped peasant troops, and paid for by Galician nobles such as Pedro Fernandes de Castro II, the Count of Monterrei, Gaspar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga e Azevedo, and others. The war against England (1585\u20131604), motivated by the traditional English support of Portugal and Holland, also had disastrous consequences for the Kingdom of Galicia. This was due to both the disruption of trade relations with northern Europe, which since the Middle Ages had provided enormous wealth to the kingdom, and also by the onset of constant attacks by England in order to end the maritime expeditions sent by Philip II as the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588.\n\nThe outcome of these royal policies was the complete ruin of Galician villages such as Ferrol, where the civilians were ruined due to the expulsion from their homes by Philip's soldiers, who seized all their crops and property, and drove the fishermen into forced labor. Towns like A Coru\u00f1a also suffered constant attacks by the English fleet, such as by [[Francis Drake]] in 1589, with the cities being protected by civilians troops and heroic people as [[Maria Pita]].\n\n===The last Habsburgs (1598\u20131700)===\n[[File:Descripcion Reyno de Galizia de Ojea.jpg|thumb|left|The Kingdom of Galicia in 1603]]\nThe death of Philip II in 1598 didn't change the socio-political future of Galicia, but the worsening insecurity and poverty in the kingdom. Although the reign of [[Philip III of Spain]] (1598\u20131621) was marked by a more conciliatory foreign policy and peaceful than that of his father, however, in general the 17th century (reigns of Philip IV and Charles II) was witnessed of dramatical wars between the Habsburg's territories against Holland, England, France and especially Portugal, which had a remarkable social and economic impact in Galicia.\n\nThus, while the conflicts against the Ottomans had a great impact in the kingdom with the devastating attack in the Rias Baixas in 1617, the unpopular war against Portugal (1640\u20131668) and the war waged by the Habsburg monarchs against the Netherlands for decades, accounted a constant bleeding of Galician peasants, who were sent to the war front from the Atlantic seaports. Fray Felipe de la Gandara, official chronicler of the kingdom of Galicia complained that during 25 years (between the years 1624 and 1659), \"the kingdom of Galicia has served for now during the glorious reign of His Majesty (Philip IV) until the year 1659 with more than 68,000 men and 18,001,000 ducats\".\n\nThe war effects also made the point in the economy, the kingdom continued suffering a trade serious paralysis with all its Atlantic traditional customers; England, France, [[Flanders]], and even particularly serious with its main customer, Portugal, whose border had been closed for over three decades due to war with what the Habsburgs sought to avoid the independence of the Portuguese kingdom.\n\nThe provisions of the Spanish monarchs against trading timber in the kingdom, also contributed to deepen the crisis. With the imposition a new (and controversial) administrative figure;  the ''juez de plant\u00edos y dehesas'' (\"judge of forests and plantings\") the [[Council of Castile|Castilian Council]] reclaimed the economical rights in the Galician forest holdings for the construction warships dedicated to the war. While the Galicia inhabitants came to be arrested for the simple collection of firewood to heat their houses as he denounced the Galicia Council (''Junta del Reyno de Galicia'').\n\n===Restoration of voting at the Council of Castile (1623)===\n[[File:Conde de gondomar.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a]], count of [[Gondomar, Pontevedra|Gondomar]], was one of the main advocates of voting rights at the [[Council of Castile]].

However, from 1518 the Galician cities and towns began to demand to regain their legitimate voting in the [[Council of Castile]], and rejected the Zamoran leaders speaking for them.\n\nThe recovery of their voting rights at the Council of Castile was a goal shared by the Galician aristocracy and the kingdom's [[oligarchy|oligarchs]]. In 1520 the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santiago de Compostela|Archbishop of Santiago]], Afonso III da Fonseca, and the Counts of Benavente and Andrade complained about it during the celebration of the Castilian Council in the Galician capital, Compostela, but to no avail. The involvement of Galician elites achieved an assembly between nobles and prelates of the kingdom in the town of [[Melide, A Coru\u00f1a|Melide]] in central Galicia on December 4, 1520. This was headed by Afonso III da Fonseca, and they sent a new demand to the emperor on the subject of the vote, however [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] again refused to give Galicia an independent voice.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 87%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:23em; max-width: 25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n''Quando eu non tibera a obriga\u00e7on que o mundo save pola nobre\u00e7a que en Vmd co\u00f1e\u00e7o o fijera A esos meus se\u00f1ores seus fillos de Vmd e primos meus ueyjo infinitas ue\u00e7es as mans e deus os faga en to do seus fillos de Vmd e de mi\u00f1a se\u00f1ora Dona Costan\u00e7a.

Sent to [[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a]], this letter is one of the few witnesses in [[Galician language]] during the 17th century.\n|}\n\nA year after the emperor's refusal, the Galician city council took a new initiative, and in 1557 the kingdom representation offered 20,000 ducats to demand its vote in the Castilian Council. This aspiration was put to successive meetings, until in 1599 the kingdom's audience accepted the Galician cities' demands, and agreed to negotiate exclusively that subject. Two delegations were chosen to go to [[Madrid]], but the new economic offer was rejected.\n\nHowever, in 1621, there arose circumstances that led to the success of the Galician aspirations. The monarchy needed the political and financial cooperation of their kingdoms in order to sustain their war efforts, following the end of twelve years of truce. The oligarchy and the Galician city councils were able to seize that occasion, and despite the resistance of [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]], and the eagerness of other cities with exclusionary voting at the Courts, the Crown sacrificed political expediency for the sake of military necessity, and in 1623 the kingdom of Galicia regained the vote, dependent upon paying 100,000 ducats to build a navy to defend its own coastline. The influence of [[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a]], Count Gondomar, was crucial to the success of this action, and [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] signed the resolution on October 13, 1623.\n\n===The establishment of the Bourbons (18th century)===\nIn 1700, [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II of Habsburg]] died without an heir. This caused a war between those who supported the French [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V of Bourbon]] as the successor (mainly the [[crown of Castile]] and France) and those who supported the Austrian Archduke [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI of Habsburg]] (the [[Crown of Aragon]], England and [[Holland]] among others). In fact the struggle between these two suitors was also basically a struggle between two political conceptions: on the one hand the absolutist [[centralism]] French -represented by Philip V and the Bourbon monarchy- and on the other the [[federalism]] of Charles VI of Habsburg. In this long war (1701\u20131714) between the crown of Castile and the [[Crown of Aragon]], the kingdom of Galicia could not avail itself of an own policy due to being controlled strongly since 1486 by Castile, so that troops and positions in Galicia had to serve to the suitor supported by the Castilian Crown; Philip V of Bourbon, who in 1714 eventually won the war.\n\nFrom the political point of view, the result of this war was the establishment of a monarchy that settled in Castile, from where it developed a uniformizing policy, which had its maximum expression in the \"[[Nueva Planta Decrees]]\" (1707\u20131716) which were designed to punish the [[Crown of Aragon]] through eliminating their political bodies and imposing a \"Audiencia\" such as took place 200 years before in the kingdom of Galicia. With the suppression of the old crowns -Castile and Aragon- in 1715, was created the \"Crown of Spain\" that was governed solely by Castilian government, notably by the [[Council of Castile]]. Besides, Bourbons established according to the French model, a  \"provincial Intendance\" on their territories, taking the kingdom of Galicia an Intendance, and being under the command of a General Captain.\n\nCultural and linguistic polities were strongly standardizing, according to the centralist conception of the Bourbons, which is expressed in explicit and stringent laws to end the linguistic diversity in the kingdoms (over Bourbons control)  that had a native language different from Castilian:\n\n''Finally, I command that the teaching of the first letters, Latin and rhetoric will only in Castilian language, taking care this compliance the Audiencias and the respective Courts. May 23, 1768''. Charles III of Bourbon.\n\n===The Enlightenment (1746\u201388)===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 87%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:23em; max-width: 25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\nNot a few times I thought which was the reason why in Galicia has introduced the use or abuse of writing in Castilian,&nbsp;... who have introduced it?&nbsp;...

[[Mart\u00edn Sarmiento]].\n|}\n\nDuring the 18th century, like in other European kingdoms, arose a movement representing a new interest in empirical ideas, in philosophy, [[political economy]], and sciences such as physics, chemistry, and biology\u2014what today is named the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. In this context began a process of construction and a recovery of consciousness of the historical personality, the cultural and economic diversity of the Kingdom of Galicia due to important Galician Enlightenment writers who knew Galicia as a differentiated society, and as a kingdom with special needs.\n\n[[File:Mart\u00edn Sarmiento.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of [[Mart\u00edn Sarmiento]]]]\nIn the vast task of modernizing the kingdom to use to best advantage their human and natural resources, the Galician societies and academies played a prominent role, such as the ''Academy of Agriculture of the Kingdom of Galicia'' (inaugurated on January 20, 1765), ''The Economic Society of Friends of the Kingdom of Galicia'' (February 15, 1784), and the ''Societies of Friends of the Country to Santiago de Compostela'' (1784) and ''Lugo'' (1785), as well as ambitious proposals such as the ''Royal Fishermen's Pawnshop of the Kingdom of Galicia'' (1775).\n\nThe Enlightenment writers were the first to denounce the difficulties of the kingdom, most of them arising from the negative politics that the kingdom suffered by the Catholic Monarchs and the Habsburgs\u00b4 polities. They began reporting on the state of roads, the unnecessary imports, the mass emigration, the linguistic acculturation polities, and the economic marginalization of the kingdom. Due to their demands, they achieved, among others successes, the constitution of a ''Maritime and Land Consulate'' in A Coru\u00f1a, allowing to the Galicia to trade with the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]].\n\nIn the enormous contribution to language and culture of the kingdom, two [[ecclesiastic]]s stand out, [[Benito Jer\u00f3nimo Feij\u00f3o y Montenegro]] and [[Mart\u00edn Sarmiento]]. Montenegro was the first to denounce the misery of the Galician peasants, proposing changes in the administration of the kingdom. Sarmiento, with extensive knowledge of [[botany]] and [[natural medicine]]s, devoted himself to [[philology]]; he wrote the ''Catalogue of voices and phrases of the Galician language'' (1745\u20131755), and was a great defender of the [[Galician language]], defending it against those who tried discredit it. Economic themes were also highlighted by other Galician aristocrats, such as Joseph Cornide Saavedra, Pedro Antonio S\u00e1nchez, and Lucas Labrada, as well as ecclesiastics like Francisco de Castro, and merchants like Antonio Raimundo Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez. They were all authors of many works of vital importance in economic development, such ''Report on sardine fishing off the coast of Galicia'' (1774), and the ''Economic description of the Kingdom of Galicia'' (1804).\n\n===19th century===\nThe Kingdom of Galicia and the Junta continued to formally exist until the State Liberal Reform of 1833, at the time of the provincial division under the regency of [[Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies]]. Galicia regained its territorial unity for twenty-four days by the constitution of the ''Junta de Gobierno de Galicia'' following a liberal armed uprising in 1846, the [[M\u00e1rtires de Carral]], but never regained the status of a kingdom.\n\n==Culture==\nDue to mythologies surrounding Galicia's history (especially era of the kingdom), the kingdom has been called \"Terra Meiga\" (land of the witches) or \"Reino Meiga\" (kingdom of the witches)<ref>https://santiagoways.com/en/myths-and-legends-of-the-camino-de-santiago/</ref>\n\n==Symbols of the kingdom==\n[[File:TumboA Alfonso.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Romanesque miniature representing [[Alfonso IX of Le\u00f3n|Alfonso IX]], King of Le\u00f3n. In the upper part appears his historic title ''Rex Legionensium et Gallecie'', while the lower part shows the purple lion, symbol of the Leonese monarchy]]\n\n===The purple lion===\nThe custom of painting symbols such as the [[heraldry|heraldic]] shields of war was forged in the battlefields of Europe after the middle decades of the 12th century, due to a confluence of circumstances of different natures. One was the need to differentiate between allies and adversaries on the battlefield, partly due to facial protection in [[Combat helmet#Medieval and early modern militaries|medieval helmets]] obscuring the combatant's faces, but also due to the high ornamental value of decorated shields with bright, crisp, and alternate shapes in the context of the [[Chivalry|chivalrous]] society.\n\nThe first heraldic signs were used by kings as a personal mark to identify himself. Shortly after they began to be shared by the upper social levels close to the royalty, and finally were used to represent the territory in which they exercised their jurisdiction, the kingdom.\n\nOne of the first kings in Europe who made use of a heraldic emblem was the Leonese king, [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n|Alphonse VII]]. At the beginning of the 12th century he began timidly using a purple lion in accordance with its ancient symbolism, as ''Leo Fortis'', the \"strong lion\", symbolized power and primacy of the monarch, but would also have represented a [[canting arms|punning reference]] to the name of his kingdom, Le\u00f3n. The emblem was developed with his son [[Ferdinand II of Le\u00f3n|Ferdinand II]], and was finally established by [[Alfonso IX of Le\u00f3n|Alphonse IX]].\n\n===The Chalice, symbol of the kingdom===\nParallel to the process of development and consolidation of European royal emblems from the late 13th century, collections of them, the ''[[Armorial]]s'', displayed lists of kingdoms and their royal symbols. In the case of Galicia, antiquity and the prominence which the Kingdom had had during centuries saw its inclusion in the early European armorials.  However, the absence of an exclusive symbol for Galician kings, who were also kings of Le\u00f3n since the 12th century, forced to the medieval heraldists to use [[Canting arms]], which was a symbol derived from the [[phonetic]]s of the name.\n\nAn English armorial named ''Segar's Roll'', produced in 1282, was the first Armorial which assigned the chalice as the [[Coat of Arms]] for the King and Kingdom of Galicia (''Roy de Galice''), probably coming directly from the Anglo-Norman word for Galicia, ''Galyce'', which was very close to the word ''Calice'' ([[chalice]]). Following that time, different European armorials began to use the chalice as the emblem of the Kingdom of Galicia.<ref>{{cite book |first=Barreiro |last=Fern\u00e1ndez|editor-first=Xos\u00e9 |editor-last=Ram\u00f3n |title=Os s\u00edmbolos de Galicia|year=2007|publisher=Consello da Cultura Galega|location=Santiago de Compostela|isbn=978-84-96530-46-1|pages=38\u201340|url=http://consellodacultura.org/mediateca/extras/simbolos_de_galicia.pdf}}</ref>  In the mid-15th century, this symbol came to Galicia, where it was easily and readily accepted, as the [[Holy Grail]] was already a symbol widely spread over Europe and already present in Galician history and deepest beliefs.\n\nThereafter, the purple lion of the former Galician-Leonese monarchy lost its representative character in favor of the better known canting arms, being then adopted exclusively by the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n, whilst in Galicia the chalice would develop into the modern coat-of-arms of Galicia.\n<gallery>\nFile:Reino de Galicia - Kingdom of Galicia - Segars Roll.jpg|Arms of the Kings of Galicia, Segar's Roll, 13th century\nFile:Reino de Galicia-kingdom of Galicia-Maximiliano.jpg|Arms of the kingdom of Galicia in the \"Great Triumphal Chariot of Maximilian\", Year 1515.\nFile:Reino de Galicia - Kingdom of Galicia - CarolumV.jpg|Arms of the kingdom of Galicia in the ''Historia originis et succesionis regnorum et imperiorum a Noe usque ad Carolum V'', 1548.\nFile:Reino de Galicia - kingdom of Galicia - Hierosme.jpg|Arms of the kingdom od Galicia, ''Le blason des Armoiries'', Year 1581\nFile:Escudo reino de galicia.jpg|Arms of the Kingdom of Galicia, illustrated in ''L\u00b4armorial Le Blancq'', [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]], 16th century\nFile:Escudo-reyno de galizia.jpg|Arms of the Kingdom of Galicia, Pedro de Teixeira, 17th century\nFile:Cedulareinogaliza.jpg|Comercial Company of the Kingdom of Galicia, 18th century\nFile:Reino_de_Galicia_-kingdom_of_Galicia-troncoso.jpg|Arms of the kingdom of Galicia, ''Galicia.Reino de Christo Sacramentado y primog\u00e9nita de la Iglesia entre las gentes'', Year 1750.\nFile:Escudo de Galicia.svg|Arms of Galicia, today\n</gallery>\n\n==Medieval cartography==\n<gallery caption=\"The Kingdom of Galicia in medieval cartography\" widths=\"175\" heights=\"140\" class=\"center\">\nFile:WesternEurope BeatusOsma.jpg|alt=Burgo de Osma's map|[[Burgo de Osma-Ciudad de Osma, Soria|Burgo de Osma]]\u00b4s map (1086), with the names ''Gallecia'' (occupying the whole Northwest Iberian Peninsula), ''Asturias'' (occupying the Cantabrian linecoast), and ''Spania'' (occupying the rest of Iberia)\nFile:1125 Lambert de Saint Omer Liber Floridus Peninsula Iberica.jpg|alt=Liber Floridus map|In [[Liber Floridus]] (1125), by [[Lambert of Saint-Omer]], showing the names ''Galitia'', ''Hispania'', ''Lusitania'', and ''Wasconia'', among others\nFile:1154 Tabula Rogeriana Al Idrisi transcripcion de Konrad Miller 1928 detalle.jpg|alt=Tabula Rogeriana|In [[Tabula Rogeriana]] (1154), by [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]], showing the name ''Ard Galika''\nFile:1190 Imago Mundi Honorius of Autum (Henry of Mainz) Peninsula Iberica.jpg|alt=The Sawley Map|In [[Imago Mundi]] (1190), by [[Honorius Augustodunensis]], showing the names ''Galicia'' and ''Hispania''\nFile:1234 Convento de Ebstorfer Gervase of Tilbury Gallicia Regio.jpg|alt=Ebstorf Map|Ebstorf Map (1234), showing the name ''Gallicia Regio''\nFile:1320 Pietro Vesconte (Liber Secretorum de Marino Sanuto) Norte Peninsula Iberica.jpg|alt=Pietro Vesconte's map|In ''Liber Secretorum'' (1125), by Marino Sanuto, where the name ''Galitia'' occupies the entire northwestern Iberia\nFile:Galicia in pirrus de noha map.jpg|Pirrus de Noha's map (1414) where Galicia occupies the northwestern Iberia.\nFile:1420 Salustio de Ginebra Peninsula Iberica.jpg|alt=Sallust de Geneve's map|Sallust de Geneve's map (1420), where the name ''Galaecia'' occupies the entire northwestern Iberia\nFile:1475 Rudimentum Novitorum Lucas Brandis occidente europeo.jpg|alt=Lucas Brandis\u00b4 map|In ''Rudimentum Novitorum'' (1475), by Lucas Brandis, showing the names ''Galicia'', ''Hispani'', and ''Anglia'', among others\nFile:Mapa de Borgia XV noroeste Peninsula Iberica.jpg|alt=Borgia's map|Northwest Iberian Peninsula (15th century) with the names ''Galiicia'' and nearby ''infidelis Yspania''\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Arias, Jorge C.

As with most Germanic invasions, the number of the original Suebi is estimated to be relatively low, generally fewer than 100,000,<ref>80,000 Vandals and Alans passed into Africa in 429, on the account of [[Victor Vitensis]].</ref> and most often around 30,000 people.<ref>Cf. Arias (2007) pp. 15\u201316.</ref> They settled mainly in the regions around modern northern [[Portugal]] and Western Galicia, in the towns of Braga (''Bracara Augusta'') and [[Porto]], and later in [[Lugo]] (''Lucus Augusta'') and [[Astorga (Spain)|Astorga]] (''Asturica Augusta'').

In 438 [[Hermeric]] ratified a peace treaty with the ''Gallaeci'', the native and partially [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanized]] people.\n\nIllness led Hermeric to [[abdicate]] in favor of his son, [[Rechila]], who moved his troops to the south and the east, conquering [[M\u00e9rida, Spain|M\u00e9rida]] and [[Seville]], the capitals of the Roman provinces of [[Lusitania]] and [[Betica]].<ref>Thompson (2002) p. 162.</ref> In 448 Rechila died, leaving the expanding state to his son [[Rechiar]], who in 449 became one of the first Germanic kings of post-Roman Europe to convert to Catholicism. Rechiar married a Visigothic princess, and was also the first Germanic king to mint coins in ancient Roman territories. Rechiar led further expansions to the east, marauding through the ''Provincia [[Tarraconensis]]'', which was still held by Rome. The Roman emperor [[Avitus]] sent a large army of ''foederates'', under the direction of the Visigoth [[Theoderic II]], who defeated the Suebi army by the river [[\u00d3rbigo]], near modern-day [[Astorga, Spain|Astorga]]. Rechiar fled, but he was pursued and captured, then executed in 457.\n\nIn the aftermath of Rechiar's death, multiple candidates for the throne appeared, finally grouping into two allegiances. The division between the two groups was marked by the [[Minho River|Minius River]] (now Minho River), probably as a consequence of the localities of the [[Quadi]] and [[Marcomanni]] tribes, who constituted the Suebi nation on the [[Iberian Peninsula]].<ref>Together with the Suebi came another Germanic tribe, the [[Buri (Germanic tribe)|Buri]], that settled in the lands known as ''[[Terras de Bouro]]'' (Lands of the Buri) in what is now Portugal.</ref> The Suebi in the north conquered Lugo, proceeding to use that city as their co-capital, while the Suebi in the south expanded into [[Lisbon]] and [[Conimbriga]], which were assaulted, and abandoned after their Roman inhabitants were banished.

Later, King [[Theodemir (Suebian king)|Theodemar]] ordered an administrative and ecclesiastical division of his kingdom, with the creation of new [[Diocese|bishoprics]] and the promotion of Lugo, which possessed a large Suebi community, to the level of [[Metropolitan Bishop]] along with Braga.\n\nTheodemar's son and successor, King [[Miro (Suevic king)|Miro]], called for the [[Second Council of Braga]], which was attended by all the bishops of the kingdom, from the [[Britons (historical)|Briton]] bishopric of [[Britonia]] in the [[Bay of Biscay]], to [[Astorga, Spain|Astorga]] in the east, and [[Coimbra]] and [[Idanha-a-Nova Municipality|Idanha]] in the south. Five of the attendant bishops used Germanic names, showing the integration of the different communities of the country. King Miro also promoted contention with the Arian Visigoths, who under the leadership of King [[Leovigild]] were rebuilding their fragmented kingdom which had been ruled mostly by [[Ostrogoths]] since the beginning of the 6th century, following the defeat and expulsion of [[Aquitania]] by the Franks. After clashing in frontier lands, Miro and Leovigild agreed upon a temporary peace.\n\nThe Suebi maintained their independence until 585, when Leovigild, on the pretext of conflict over the succession, invaded the Suebic kingdom and finally defeated it. [[Audeca]], the last king of the Suebi, who had deposed his brother-in-law [[Eboric]], held out for a year before being captured in 585. This same year a nobleman named [[Malaric]] rebelled against the Goths, but he was defeated.<ref>Arias (2007) pp. 32\u201333.</ref>\n\nAs with the Visigothic language, there are only traces of the Suebi tongue remaining, as they quickly adopted the local [[vulgar Latin]].

In 656 he was appointed bishop of Braga and metropolitan of Galicia, ostensibly against his own will.\n\nDuring his later years the Visigothic monarchy suffered a pronounced decline, due in large part to a decrease in trade and therefore a sharp reduction in [[monetary]] circulation, largely as a result of the Muslim occupations in the early 8th century in the south [[Mediterranean]]. The Gallaecia were also affected, and Fructuosus of Braga denounced the general cultural decline and loss of the momentum from previous periods, causing some discontent in the Galician high clergy. At the tenth [[Council of Toledo]] in 656, Fructuosus was appointed to the Metropolitan seat of Potamio after the renunciation of its previous occupier. At the same time the [[Will (law)|Will]] of the Bishop of Dume Recimiro was declared [[Void (law)|void]] after he donated the wealth of the [[diocese]] [[convent]] to the poor.\n\nThe crisis at the end of the Visigoth era dates to the reign of [[Egica]]. The monarch appointed his son [[Wittiza]] as his heir, and despite the fact that the Visigothic monarchy had been traditionally [[Election|elective]] rather than [[hereditary]] Egica associated Wittiza during his lifetime to the throne (for example, Egica and Wittiza are known to have issued coinage with the confronted effigies of both monarchs). In 701 an outbreak of [[Plague (disease)|plague]] spread westward from [[Greece]] to Spain, reaching [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], the Visigothic capital, in the same year, and having such impact that the royal family, including Egica and Wittiza, fled. It has been suggested<ref>Roger Collins (2004), ''Visigothic Spain, 409\u2013711''. (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing.), 110. {{ISBN|0-631-18185-7}}.</ref> that this provided the occasion for sending Wittiza to rule the Kingdom of the Suevi from [[Tui, Galicia|Tui]],<ref>As assumed by the 10th century ''[[Chronicle of Alfonso III]]''.</ref> which is recorded as his capital. The possibility has also been raised that the 13th-century chronicler, [[Lucas of Tuy]], when he records that Wittiza relieved the oppression of the Jews (a fact unknown from his reign at Toledo after his father), may in fact refer to his reign at Lucas' hometown of Tui, where an oral tradition may have been preserved of the events of his Galician reign.<ref>Bernard S. Bachrach (1973), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1853939 \"A Reassessment of Visigothic Jewish Policy, 589\u2013711.\"] ''[[The American Historical Review]]'', '''78''':1 (Feb.), pp 31\u201332. Lucas' account has a large number of both detractors (Graetz, Katz, and Dahn) and supporters (Scherer, Ziegler, and Altamira) and even if true it is possible that Lucas' story is based on the minutes of [[XVIII Toledo]], which still survived in his time.</ref>\n\nIn 702, with the death of Egica, Wittiza as sole king moved his capital to [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. In 710, part of the Visigothic aristocracy violently raised [[Roderic]] to the throne, triggering a civil war with the supporters of Wittiza and his sons. In 711, the enemies of [[Roderic]] got a Muslim army to cross the [[Straits of Gibraltar]] and face him at the [[Battle of Guadalete]]. The defeat was the end of Roderic and of the Visigothic rule, with profound consequences for the whole of the Iberian peninsula.\n\n==Early and High Middle Ages==\n[[File:Theodemirus.JPG|thumb|left|Tombstone of the [[sepulcher]] of bishop [[Theodemar of Iria]] (d. 847), discoverer of the tomb attributed to apostle [[Saint James the Great]]]]\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 87%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:23em; max-width: 25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n\"Alfonso king of Galicia and of Asturias, after having ravaged Lisbon, the last city of Spain, sent during the winter the insignias of his victory, breastplates, mules, and Moor prisoners, through his legates Froia and Basiliscus.\" [[Annales regni Francorum]], c 798.<ref>[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/annalesregnifrancorum.html at the Latin Library.]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n\"And so, as I've been told, when Adefonsus departed of this world, as Nepotianus usurped the kingdom of [[Ramiro I of Asturias|Ramiro]], Ramiro went to the city of Lugo in Galicia, and there he reunited the army of the whole province.

This role was assumed by the rural north during the Early and High Middle Ages, as a consequence not only of the Islamic invasion, but as the final result of a continental wide urban crisis.\n\nThe old bishoprics of Braga, Ourense, Tui, Lamego, and others, were either discontinued, or re-established in the north, under the protection of Lugo\u2014which was now a stronghold due to its Roman walls\u2014and [[Iria Flavia]]. [[Dumio]] was re-established by the [[Bay of Biscay]] in [[Mondo\u00f1edo]], Lugo assumed the role of Braga, and the bishops of Lamego and Tui sought refugee in Iria, where they received generous territorial grants. During the 9th, 10th, and 11th centuries most of these bishoprics were re-established in their historical sees, but at this time the bishops of Lugo, Mondo\u00f1edo, and Iria became major political players; not just as religious figures, but also as wealthy, and sometimes mighty secular powers. In particular, the bishops of Iria and [[Santiago de Compostela|Compostela]] were notorious [[warlord]]s,<ref>The [[Historia Compostellana]] of the 12th century records a popular proverb: \"Bishop of Santiago: Staff and Crossbow\" (HC, II.1)</ref> due to the many fortresses and military resources they controlled as heads of a military [[Normans|Norman]] mark,<ref>The presence of Norman (Viking) raiders by the coasts of Galicia is constant during much of the 9th, 10th and 11th centuries; even a bishop, Sisenand II, was killed while fighting them, in the Battle of Fornelos, in 977.

Rights to the tax collection and government of each territory was granted by the [[titular ruler]]\u2014usually the king\u2014to a [[count]], bishopric, or large monastery, although there existed some singularities. The bishopric of Lugo was divided into counties, each one under the government of an ''infanzon'' (a lesser nobleman) as a concession of the bishop, while in the south, large and mighty territories such as the ''Portucalense'' became hereditary, passed down to the descendants of the 9th century's conquerors. In the ''Terra de Santiago'' (Land of Saint James, the fief of the bishops of Iria-Compostela) each territory was administered by a bishop's vicar, while justice was administered by a council composed of representatives of the local churchmen, knights, and peasants.<ref>L\u00f3pez Ferreiro (1895) pp. 155\u2013165.</ref>\n\nEach territory or county could be further divided into ''mandationes'' and ''decanias''. The basic territorial division was the ''villa'', centered on a church, and composed of one or more hamlets or villages, together with all its facilities, lands, and possessions. The ''villas'' perpetuated ancient Roman and Suevic foundations, and they were the base for the ecclesiastical organization, and for the economic production of the country, later evolving into the modern ''parroquias'' and ''freguesias'' (rural parishes). The local economy was [[List of subsistence techniques|subsistence]], based mainly on the production of grain and beans, and notably in cattle breeding.<ref>The modern Galician, Portuguese and Spanish words for cattle (''gando, gado, ganado'', respectively) derive from a term meaning ''per se'' \u2013 \"the earned thing\".</ref> Other valuable\u2014though geographically restricted\u2014products included fruits, salt, wine, honey, [[olive oil]], horses, iron for the production of weapons and tools, and exotic oriental fabrics introduced from ''[[Muslim Spain|Spania]]''. There were also specialized [[artisan]]s who worked on demand, such as [[masonry|masons]] and [[goldsmith]]s.\n\nWhile local commerce was common, long range interchanges\u2014generally maintained by [[Hebrew]] merchants\u2014were rare and appreciated. Monetary circulation was scarce, composed mainly of old Suebi and Visigothic coinage known locally as ''solidos gallicianos''. War and pillaging against the thriving Al-Andalus was also a very important source for the acquisition of riches, exotic items, and Muslim serfs. Later, pilgrimage of Christians from all over Europe to [[Santiago de Compostela]] brought not only riches, but also a range of continental innovations and trends, from [[shipbuilding]], to new [[architectural styles]] such as [[Romanesque art]].\n\n[[File:San Marti\u00f1o de Mondo\u00f1edo-Foz(Lugo).jpg|right|thumb|Romanesque cathedral of San Marti\u00f1o de Mondo\u00f1edo (9th\u201311th centuries); first construction dates from the 6th\u20137th centuries]]\nThe elites were composed of counts, [[duke]]s, ''senatores'', and other high noblemen, who were frequently related by marriage with the monarch,<ref>During the High Middle Ages not unusually a king would refer to a Galician nobleman or to a noblewoman as uncle or aunt.</ref> and who usually claimed the most powerful positions in society, either as governors, bishops, or as [[palatine]] officials or companions of the king or queen. The Galician nobility however were also frequently found as rebels, either as supporters of a different candidate to the throne, or aspiring to it themselves, or simply as disobedient to the king's orders and will.<ref>For instance, the list of the rebels against Alfonso III include in Galicia noblemen such as count Froila Lemundi, who was briefly king; duke Uittiza in southern Galicia, who resisted for seven years; count Flacidio in Lugo; the brothers Aldreto and Flacencius again in Lugo; Oduarius in the east; Hermegildo and Iberia in the west... Cf.  Bali\u00f1as P\u00e9rez (1998) pp. 104\u2013107.</ref> At the service of the noblemen were ''miles'' ([[knight]]s) and ''infanzones''; they were often found marching to war with their subalterns on behalf of a patron, or as vicars and administrators.\n\nA sizable section of the society were [[churchmen]]\u2014[[presbyters]], deacons, clergymen, ''lectors'', ''confessos'', monks, and nuns\u2014who frequently lived in [[religious communities]], some of which were composed of both men and women living under [[Vow of chastity|vows of chastity]] and [[Vow of poverty|poverty]]. Most of these monasteries were directed by an [[abbot]] or [[abbess]], ruled under a pactual tradition heavily influenced by Germanic legal traditions,<ref>Cf. Bishko (1984).</ref> with a bishop ''sub regula'' as the highest authority of the community. Other monasteries used different, sometimes antagonist rules. The [[Benedictine]] and [[Augustine]] rules were uncommon until the 11th century. As in most of Europe, the [[chartulary]] and [[chronicle]] proceedings of monasteries and bishoprics are the most important source for the study of local history.<ref>In Galicia the most important chartularies for the Early and High Middle Ages are those from the monasteries of Sobrado, with documents from the 8th\u201313th centuries, Celanova (9th\u201313th), Samos (8th\u201313th)&nbsp;...  And of the cathedrals of Santiago and Lugo, with documents dated from the 8th century. In Portugal the most notable documentation for the period was edited and published by [[Alexandre Herculano]] in the 19th century, under the title ''[[Portugaliae Monumenta Historica]]''.</ref>\n\nBy the 12th century the only known [[bourgeois]] were the [[Multiethnic|multinational]] inhabitants of Compostela, by this stage a fortified and strong city. Meanwhile, the City Council of Santiago for centuries had struggled against their bishops for the recognition of a number of liberties. In the country, most people were [[Serfdom#Freemen|freemen]], peasants, artisans, or [[infantrymen]], who could freely choose a patron, or buy and sell properties, although they frequently fell prey to the greed of the big owners, leading many of them to a life of [[Slavery|servitude]]. Finally, ''servos'', ''libertos'', and ''pueros'' ([[serf]]s and [[slave]]s), either obtained in war with the [[Moors]] or through trial, constituted a visible part of the society; they were employed as household workers (''domesticos'' and ''scancianes''), [[shepherd]]s, and [[farmhand]]s. Local charters also show that, in time, they were freed.<ref>For instance, in the 10th century Saint Rudesind freed his Muslim governess, granting her a series of properties, together with 'Roman citizenship'.</ref>\n\nIn terms of religion, most were Roman Catholics, although the local rites\u2014known today as [[Mozarabic rite]]s\u2014were notably different from those used in most of Western Europe. No Arian, [[Priscillianist]], or [[Pagan]] organizations are known to have survived during the High Middle Ages.<ref>For the pagan survivals: Cf. Stephen McKenna (1938) [http://libro.uca.edu/mckenna/paganism.htm ''Paganism and Pagan Survivals in Spain up to the Fall of the Visigothic Kingdom ''].</ref> However, there were still pagans and pagan shrines in the [[Bierzo]] region during the 7th century, whilst Arian or Priscillianist [[tonsure]]\u2014seen as long hair, with only a partial tonsure atop the head\u2014was in use in Galicia up to 681, when it was forbidden at a council in Toledo. There were no known Muslim communities in Galicia and northern Portugal, other than Moor serfs. Records of [[Hebrew people]] are also uncommon in local charters until the 12th century, except as travelers and merchants.<ref>''Pace'' {{cite book|last=Onega|first=Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n|title=Los jud\u00edos en el reino de Galicia|year=1999|publisher=Editora Nacional|location=Madrid|isbn=84-931225-1-3|edition=2.}}</ref>\n\nPersonal names in Galicia and northern Portugal were chiefly of Germanic origin, although Christian, Roman, and Greek names were also common. Names were usually composed just of a single surname, although noblemen frequently also used a [[patronymic]].

Fruela's son, [[Alfonso Fr\u00f3ilaz]], received support from Asturias, but was captured and blinded by [[Sancho I Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez|Sancho]], [[Alfonso IV of Le\u00f3n|Alfonso IV]], and [[Ramiro II of Le\u00f3n|Ramiro II]], sons of Ordo\u00f1o, with the aid of the [[Basque people|Basque]] troops of [[Jimeno Garc\u00e9s of Pamplona]]. Vague and conflicting historical records make it uncertain whether Alfonso Fr\u00f3ilaz reigned briefly as king of the entire kingdom, or simply held a remote part of Asturias.<ref>Isla Fernandez (1999) p. 25.</ref> In Galicia, Sancho succeeded, being crowned in Santiago de Compostela and marrying a Galician noblewoman. After reigning for just three years he died childless. Alfonso IV then took control of an again-reunited Kingdom of Le\u00f3n in 929; however, he was forced into a monastery by their youngest brother, Ramiro, two years later.<ref>Rodr\u00edguez Fern\u00e1ndez (1997) p. 212.</ref>\n\nRamiro II had ties with the Galician nobility through kinship, marriage and patronage, and he and his son, [[Ordo\u00f1o III of Le\u00f3n|Ordo\u00f1o III]], whose mother was Galician, reigned with their support. This was not the case when Ordo\u00f1o was succeeded by his half-brother [[Sancho I of Le\u00f3n]] in 956. Sancho proved unpopular and ineffectual and the Galician nobles grew fractious, forming a coalition with [[Fern\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez of Castile]] to overthrow Sancho in favor of [[Ordo\u00f1o IV of Le\u00f3n|Ordo\u00f1o IV]], who was enthroned in Santiago de Compostela in 958.<ref>Portela Silva (2001) p. 165.</ref> However Sancho reclaimed the crown in 960 with support from his mother's [[Kingdom of Pamplona]], the Leonese nobility, and Muslim assistance.<ref>After returning to the throne he frequently spoke of his \"returning back from Spain\": ''\"Era DCCCCa LXLVIII anno regni nostri quarto & de adventu Spanie secundo\"'', ([https://books.google.com/books?ct=result&id=Jd_m6RMiSRwC&dq=sahagun&q=spania#v=onepage&q&f=false document from the Monastery of Sahag\u00fan]).

When the [[Count of Castile]]\u2014nominally a Leonese [[vassal]], but ''de facto'' independent\u2014was assassinated in Le\u00f3n in 1029, Sancho claimed the right to name the successor, giving it to his own son [[Ferdinand I of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Ferdinand]]. Taking advantage of the youth of Leonese king [[Bermudo III of Le\u00f3n|Bermudo III]], Sancho seized disputed border regions, formalizing the arrangement by including the lands in the dowry of Bermudo's sister, who was married to Ferdinand in 1032. Two years later, in 1034, Sancho took Bermudo's capital, becoming ''de facto'' ruler of most of the kingdom, whilst leaving Bermudo to rule from his refuge in Galicia. Sancho's death the next year allowed Bermudo to regain not only the entire kingdom, but to briefly become overlord of Ferdinand's Castile. However, in 1037, the Castilian count killed Bermudo in battle, and Galicia passed with the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n into the hands of Ferdinand, who then had himself crowned king.\n\n[[File:Europe-south-west-kingdoms.png|thumb|right|Political situation in the Northern [[Iberian Peninsula]] around 1065:\n{{legend|#ba7f45|[[Garc\u00eda II of Galicia|Garcia II]]'s domains (Galicia)}}\n{{legend|#68ae94|Badajoz, owing tribute to Garcia}}\n{{legend|#329ca7|Seville, owing tribute to Garcia}}\n{{legend|#c2a541|[[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Alfonso VI]]'s domains (Le\u00f3n)}}\n{{legend|#88a756|Toledo, owing tribute to Alfonso}}\n{{legend|#dcc983|[[Sancho II of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Sancho II]]'s domains (Castile)}}\n{{legend|#c0bf78|Zaragoza, owing tribute to Sancho}}]]\n\nFerdinand's death in 1065 led to another short-lived Galician state.

Both Burgundians were close allies in the affairs of the realm, ratifying a pact of friendship where Raymond promised his cousin to give to him the Kingdom of Toledo or the Kingdom of Galicia, together with a third of his treasure, in return for Henry's aid in acquiring the crown as successor of King Alfonso.<ref>Reilly (1982) p. 27.</ref> However, by 1097 King Alfonso granted Henry the counties of [[County of Portugal|Portugal]] and [[County of Coimbra|Coimbra]], from the river [[Minho River|Minho]] to the [[Tagus]],<ref name=\"Reilly 1982 p. 29\">Reilly (1982) p. 29.</ref> thus limiting the powers of Raymond, who by this time was securing an important nucleus of partisans in Galicia, including [[Pedro Fr\u00f3ilaz de Traba|Count Pedro Fr\u00f3ilaz de Traba]], whilst appointing his own notary, [[Diego Gelm\u00edrez]], as bishop of Compostela.

Reilly (1982) p. 48, 50.</ref> King Alfonso, in a council held in Le\u00f3n, asked of the magnates of Galicia to swear an oath on the defense of the rights of his grandson, Alfonso Raim\u00fandez, to the kingdom of Galicia, in case his mother Urraca remarried.<ref>Reilly (1982) p. 49.</ref>\n\nOn June 30, 1109, King Alfonso VI died. He was succeeded by Queen Urraca, who remarried in 1109 to the king of Aragon, [[Alfonso the Battler]], a soldier by nature who was immediately received as king in Castille and Le\u00f3n, but not in Galicia. As part of the marriage settlement, any children born to the union were to have priority over Raymond's son Alfonso in the succession. In Galicia this union was rejected by the old party of count Raymond, now led by count Pedro Fr\u00f3ilaz, tutor of young Alfonso, although the partisans of Urraca also joined forces.<ref>Villaca\u00f1as Berlanga (2006) p. 361.</ref> With Leon and Castille quiet and under control, Alfonso moved on Galicia in 1110, and while he did not suffer any major defeat, he had little success, returning three months later to Le\u00f3n.

Two trends emerged at this time, firstly a policy of rapprochement with the new King [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Alfonso VII]], and secondly the maintenance of their power with the aim that the heir to the county would be proclaimed king. The increasing importance of [[Santiago de Compostela]]\u2014now [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan church]] of [[Lusitania]], which was in open competition with Braga, metropolitan church of Galicia\u2014and the support for Theresa's rule north of the Minho brought about by her romantic union with [[Fernando P\u00e9rez de Traba]] altered the ''status quo''. The Archbishop of Braga, who had suffered the nocturnal theft of the [[relic]]s of Fructuosus of Braga by [[Diego Gelmirez]] in 1102,<ref>Fletcher (1984) p. 115.</ref> and the major Portuguese aristocrats who were pursuing a larger territorial authority, gave support to the royal pretensions of [[Afonso Henriques]]. Given this situation, King Alfonso VII marched on Portugal, taking first Tui and other territories north of the river Minho, later besieging [[Guimar\u00e3es]] and obtaining the submission of the Portuguese.<ref>Gonz\u00e1lez L\u00f3pez (1978) pp. 231\u2013236.</ref>\n\nSeveral months later, in 1128, inspired by the shortcomings of Afonso Henriques, the Galician and Portuguese troops of Theresa and Fernando Perez de Trava entered Portugal, but the men of Afonso scored a decisive victory at the [[Battle of S\u00e3o Mamede]]. The later death of Theresa, and Afonso's success against the Moors at the [[Battle of Ourique]], led to him being proclaimed King of the Portuguese in 1139, this independence being recognized at the [[Treaty of Zamora]] in 1143. Still, the statute of frontier lands such as [[Toro\u00f1o]] and [[Limia, Spain|Limia]] in southern Galicia led to frequent border conflicts during most of the Lower Middle Ages.<ref>Gonz\u00e1lez L\u00f3pez (1978) pp. 237\u2013247.</ref>\n\n===Compostelan Era (1111\u20131230)===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 87%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:23em; max-width: 25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | '''Excerpts from the ''[[Historia Compostelana]]'''''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''The laws, the rights, the peace, the justice, called the Galician to arms; everything which is wrong threw the Aragonese into every kind of crime.''

L\u00f3pez Carreira (1999) pp. 242\u2013266.</ref>\n\nThroughout this century there was also a rapid growth of the rural population, resulting in a larger force of farm labor which consequently allowed the great monasteries to develop new agricultural lands. This, coupled with the improvement of farming equipment and techniques, such as the introduction of the heavy wheeled [[plough]], resulted in an increase in [[productivity]] that impacted the people's lifestyles. The distribution of this increased productivity between peasants and lords was regulated by the establishment of ''foros'' or lifelong contracts, frequently spanning several generations or ''vozes''. The economic and social transformations led to profound changes in mindset. In the towns, it initiated a religious and intellectual renewal under the [[mendicant]] orders, most notably the [[Franciscans]], who instituted social reforms.\n\nCompostela, \"capital and looking glass\" of the Kingdom of Galicia, became a showcase of this thriving era, reflected in Master Matthew's work in the granite of the [[Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]]\u2014especially in the ''Portico da Gloria'' and in Prateria's fa\u00e7ade\u2014demonstrating a prosperity also witnessed through the numerous surviving Romanesque buildings in Galicia.

While marriage of royals had resulted in the union of some of these states\u2014for example between Navarre and Aragon, and Castile and Le\u00f3n\u2014subsequent divisions amongst heirs created a dynamic pattern of union and separation. However, the 12th century initiated a series of unions that would prove permanent.\n\nAlfonso IX married twice. From his first marriage to [[Theresa of Portugal, Queen of Le\u00f3n|Teresa of Portugal]] he had a son, Ferdinand, and two daughters, Sancha and Aldonza. From his second marriage to [[Berengaria of Castile]], he had five children; Eleanor, who died as a child, a second [[Ferdinand III of Castile|Ferdinand]], [[Alfonso of Molina|Alfonso]], [[Berengaria of Le\u00f3n|Berengaria]], and Constance. The death of Alfonso IX's son from his first marriage, Ferdinand, in 1214 left the younger Ferdinand, from his second marriage, as heir to his father. When the Castilian king, [[Henry I of Castile|Henry I]], died in 1217 and Berengaria ceded her rights to her son, Ferdinand became King of Castile, against the will of his father.<ref>Gonz\u00e1lez L\u00f3pez (1978) p. 361.</ref>\n\nTo preserve the independence of his realm, Alfonso IX applied customary Galician-Leonese inheritance to nominate Aldonza as future Queen of Galicia, and Sancha as Queen of Le\u00f3n, enlisting their uncle [[Afonso II of Portugal]] to support their succession.<ref>Cf.

As a result, in 1354 a coalition of nobles rose in defence of a pactual monarchy,<ref name=\"Garcia Oro 1987, vol. I, 103\">Garcia Oro 1987, vol.

Meanwhile, Peter drew his support from the municipalities and part of the nobility, most notably the Galician Castro family headed by Fernando Rodrigues de Castro, ''Pertegueiro Maior'' of Santiago and ''Adelantado Mayor'' of Galicia, who after defecting Henry in 1355<ref name=\"Garcia Oro 1987, vol.

Other notable supporters were Sueiro Eans Parada, Men Rodrigues de Seabra, and the Moscoso family.\n\nIn 1366 Pedro was forced to flee into Andalusia, while Fernando de Castro routed to Galicia. After a dangerous journey through Portugal, King Pedro made it to Galicia, where an assembly of supporters decided to send him into [[Gascony]], looking for English support,<ref>Garcia Oro 1987, vol.

However, the entry of England's enemy [[Charles V of France]] on Henry's side had a destabilising effect. In 1369 the new archbishop of Santiago, the loyalist Rodrigo de Moscoso, ordered his knights to march urgently into Andalusia on the support of the King and of Fernando de Castro, but the call was ignored.<ref>''It's precise that you come immediately and as fast as you can'' (\u00abCompre que ve\u00f1ades logo et o mais a presa que poderdes\u00bb).

In practice this resulted in the disappearance of the European empire of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] and the idea of a universal Catholic monarchy. Ferdinand was declared [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and king of [[Hungary]] and [[Bohemia]], while Philip inherited the [[Netherlands]], [[Naples]] and [[Sicily]], the [[Crown of Aragon]] and Castile, including the Kingdom of Galicia.\n\nThe 42-year reign of Philip II was noted from the beginning by war\u2014against the Netherlands, France, England, Portugal and the [[Ottoman Empire]]\u2014motivated by the personal ambition of the monarch, who tried not only to avoid the loss of his domains, but to expand it.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} He created a battlefield across the Atlantic and northern Europe that had not only disastrous consequences for the Galician economy, but also for the society and people of the Kingdom of Galicia.\n\n[[File:Invincible Armada.jpg|thumb|left|Battle between the naval fleets of Philip II of Habsburg (nicknamed the \"Invincible Armada\") and Elizabeth I of England in 1588, leaving the English victorious]]\nWith his private crusade against the [[Lutheran]]s, the Catholic monarchy prevented the participation of the Kingdom of Galicia in the three most important revolutionary processes of the age, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], the opening up of the [[New World]], and the [[Scientific revolution]]. In 1562, Philip II deployed the Holy Office, via the [[Spanish Inquisition]], in the Kingdom of Galicia, after the failure of Charles V's attempts to do so due to the opposition of the Galician clergy.\n\nThe Inquisition was an instrument of cultural and religious repression without precedent, which began operating in Portugal from 1575, led by the Castilian Inquisitor Quijano del Mercado. The Inquisition's stated aim was to prevent the \"contamination\" of the Kingdom of Galicia by the reformist ideas of the Lutherans, which arrived in Galicia via English, Dutch and French traders. This situation also had serious commercial consequences, because one of the tasks of the Inquisition was to review the [[merchant ship]]s, requiring them to receive visitation rights and condemning to be [[burned at the stake]] any sailors likely to be . The Inquisition even went as far as proposing the closure of all Galician seaports to avoid religious assimilation. Such measures eventually exceeded the patience of the inhabitants of cities like A Coru\u00f1a, where in 1589 the city requested the end of inquisitorial activity at the seaport due to the serious reduction of maritime traffic in the city in this period.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 87%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:23em; max-width: 25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n\"Rodrigo Montero, cleric, priest and rector of the Fort of San Felipe&nbsp;... declared that&nbsp;... the armies of the King our Lord (Philip II), have stayed here in winter and summer in the seaport town of Ferrol&nbsp;... have done great harms to the residents of the town of Ferrol&nbsp;... as they (the Spanish troops) took the houses where Ferrol people lived and the troops forced them to leave it and look for others&nbsp;... troops have removed and cut the vines and breaking civilian's walls&nbsp;... also razed and felled the forests and wood in people's forests&nbsp;... took by force the boats to the inhabitants of the said town of Ferrol and the troops forced them to recruit and work for them without payment&nbsp;... these services didn't allow the Ferrol's men go fishing and feed their wives and children and&nbsp;... the troops also ate and destroyed the fruits of their trees and cabbages, vegetables and turnips and more lelgumbres of their orchards&nbsp;... stole them also wood tabals from the civilians houses got repairing their vessels and the benefit of the said vessels&nbsp;... |- (Rodrigo Montero, September 2, 1603)\n|}\n\nPhilip II's reign saw the continuation of the expulsion of the Jews from May 30, 1492, [[Language|linguistic]] persecution (from 1566 the adoption of Castilian was enforced, and the use of [[Arabic]] was punished by the Crown), and religious persecutions effectively constituted [[ethnic cleansing]]. For example, in [[Alpujarra]] in the [[Kingdom of Granada]] in 1568, which was at the time led by self-proclaimed Granadian king Muhammad ibn Umayya, was ordered the forced dispersal of 80,000 Granadian Muslims throughout the realm, and the introduction of Christians in their place. Thousands of Galician families were sent to Granada for that purpose between the years 1572\u201377, with many of them dying in the process.\n\nIn the field of war, the militarization motivated by the war against the Netherlands, which was largely a strategic battle used to garner support for the crown, contrasted with the lack of defence in Galicia resulting from the Catholic Monarchs removing the Galician strongholds to prevent a revolt of the kingdom. Thus, in 1580 the Board of the Kingdom of Galicia requested troops for Philip II to defend the coast, just months after a strong military recruitment had taken place. However these troops were not used to protect the kingdom, but instead to attack Portugal in to try to put Philip on the Portuguese throne.\n\nDespite claims to the contrary, the military campaign against Portugal was not carried out by professional soldiers billeted at A Coru\u00f1a, Ferrol, or Baiona, and was not paid by the crown, but was rather conducted by ill-equipped peasant troops, and paid for by Galician nobles such as Pedro Fernandes de Castro II, the Count of Monterrei, Gaspar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga e Azevedo, and others. The war against England (1585\u20131604), motivated by the traditional English support of Portugal and Holland, also had disastrous consequences for the Kingdom of Galicia. This was due to both the disruption of trade relations with northern Europe, which since the Middle Ages had provided enormous wealth to the kingdom, and also by the onset of constant attacks by England in order to end the maritime expeditions sent by Philip II as the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588.\n\nThe outcome of these royal policies was the complete ruin of Galician villages such as Ferrol, where the civilians were ruined due to the expulsion from their homes by Philip's soldiers, who seized all their crops and property, and drove the fishermen into forced labor. Towns like A Coru\u00f1a also suffered constant attacks by the English fleet, such as by [[Francis Drake]] in 1589, with the cities being protected by civilians troops and heroic people as [[Maria Pita]].\n\n===The last Habsburgs (1598\u20131700)===\n[[File:Descripcion Reyno de Galizia de Ojea.jpg|thumb|left|The Kingdom of Galicia in 1603]]\nThe death of Philip II in 1598 didn't change the socio-political future of Galicia, but the worsening insecurity and poverty in the kingdom. Although the reign of [[Philip III of Spain]] (1598\u20131621) was marked by a more conciliatory foreign policy and peaceful than that of his father, however, in general the 17th century (reigns of Philip IV and Charles II) was witnessed of dramatical wars between the Habsburg's territories against Holland, England, France and especially Portugal, which had a remarkable social and economic impact in Galicia.\n\nThus, while the conflicts against the Ottomans had a great impact in the kingdom with the devastating attack in the Rias Baixas in 1617, the unpopular war against Portugal (1640\u20131668) and the war waged by the Habsburg monarchs against the Netherlands for decades, accounted a constant bleeding of Galician peasants, who were sent to the war front from the Atlantic seaports. Fray Felipe de la Gandara, official chronicler of the kingdom of Galicia complained that during 25 years (between the years 1624 and 1659), \"the kingdom of Galicia has served for now during the glorious reign of His Majesty (Philip IV) until the year 1659 with more than 68,000 men and 18,001,000 ducats\".\n\nThe war effects also made the point in the economy, the kingdom continued suffering a trade serious paralysis with all its Atlantic traditional customers; England, France, [[Flanders]], and even particularly serious with its main customer, Portugal, whose border had been closed for over three decades due to war with what the Habsburgs sought to avoid the independence of the Portuguese kingdom.\n\nThe provisions of the Spanish monarchs against trading timber in the kingdom, also contributed to deepen the crisis. With the imposition a new (and controversial) administrative figure;  the ''juez de plant\u00edos y dehesas'' (\"judge of forests and plantings\") the [[Council of Castile|Castilian Council]] reclaimed the economical rights in the Galician forest holdings for the construction warships dedicated to the war. While the Galicia inhabitants came to be arrested for the simple collection of firewood to heat their houses as he denounced the Galicia Council (''Junta del Reyno de Galicia'').\n\n===Restoration of voting at the Council of Castile (1623)===\n[[File:Conde de gondomar.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a]], count of [[Gondomar, Pontevedra|Gondomar]], was one of the main advocates of voting rights at the [[Council of Castile]]. A humanist ambassador and lover of the [[Galician language]] and culture, he was respected and appreciated in the kingdom and abroad; c. 17th century]]\nFrom the reign of [[John II of Castile|King John II of Castile]], the kingdom of Galicia was no longer involved in the Crown Council, and from about 1476 [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]] in Le\u00f3n acted on behalf of Galicia in the assembly of the Crown of Castile. However, from 1518 the Galician cities and towns began to demand to regain their legitimate voting in the [[Council of Castile]], and rejected the Zamoran leaders speaking for them.\n\nThe recovery of their voting rights at the Council of Castile was a goal shared by the Galician aristocracy and the kingdom's [[oligarchy|oligarchs]]. In 1520 the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santiago de Compostela|Archbishop of Santiago]], Afonso III da Fonseca, and the Counts of Benavente and Andrade complained about it during the celebration of the Castilian Council in the Galician capital, Compostela, but to no avail. The involvement of Galician elites achieved an assembly between nobles and prelates of the kingdom in the town of [[Melide, A Coru\u00f1a|Melide]] in central Galicia on December 4, 1520. This was headed by Afonso III da Fonseca, and they sent a new demand to the emperor on the subject of the vote, however [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] again refused to give Galicia an independent voice.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 87%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:23em; max-width: 25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n''Quando eu non tibera a obriga\u00e7on que o mundo save pola nobre\u00e7a que en Vmd co\u00f1e\u00e7o o fijera A esos meus se\u00f1ores seus fillos de Vmd e primos meus ueyjo infinitas ue\u00e7es as mans e deus os faga en to do seus fillos de Vmd e de mi\u00f1a se\u00f1ora Dona Costan\u00e7a.

Sent to [[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a]], this letter is one of the few witnesses in [[Galician language]] during the 17th century.\n|}\n\nA year after the emperor's refusal, the Galician city council took a new initiative, and in 1557 the kingdom representation offered 20,000 ducats to demand its vote in the Castilian Council. This aspiration was put to successive meetings, until in 1599 the kingdom's audience accepted the Galician cities' demands, and agreed to negotiate exclusively that subject. Two delegations were chosen to go to [[Madrid]], but the new economic offer was rejected.\n\nHowever, in 1621, there arose circumstances that led to the success of the Galician aspirations. The monarchy needed the political and financial cooperation of their kingdoms in order to sustain their war efforts, following the end of twelve years of truce. The oligarchy and the Galician city councils were able to seize that occasion, and despite the resistance of [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]], and the eagerness of other cities with exclusionary voting at the Courts, the Crown sacrificed political expediency for the sake of military necessity, and in 1623 the kingdom of Galicia regained the vote, dependent upon paying 100,000 ducats to build a navy to defend its own coastline. The influence of [[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a]], Count Gondomar, was crucial to the success of this action, and [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] signed the resolution on October 13, 1623.\n\n===The establishment of the Bourbons (18th century)===\nIn 1700, [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II of Habsburg]] died without an heir. This caused a war between those who supported the French [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V of Bourbon]] as the successor (mainly the [[crown of Castile]] and France) and those who supported the Austrian Archduke [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI of Habsburg]] (the [[Crown of Aragon]], England and [[Holland]] among others). In fact the struggle between these two suitors was also basically a struggle between two political conceptions: on the one hand the absolutist [[centralism]] French -represented by Philip V and the Bourbon monarchy- and on the other the [[federalism]] of Charles VI of Habsburg. In this long war (1701\u20131714) between the crown of Castile and the [[Crown of Aragon]], the kingdom of Galicia could not avail itself of an own policy due to being controlled strongly since 1486 by Castile, so that troops and positions in Galicia had to serve to the suitor supported by the Castilian Crown; Philip V of Bourbon, who in 1714 eventually won the war.\n\nFrom the political point of view, the result of this war was the establishment of a monarchy that settled in Castile, from where it developed a uniformizing policy, which had its maximum expression in the \"[[Nueva Planta Decrees]]\" (1707\u20131716) which were designed to punish the [[Crown of Aragon]] through eliminating their political bodies and imposing a \"Audiencia\" such as took place 200 years before in the kingdom of Galicia. With the suppression of the old crowns -Castile and Aragon- in 1715, was created the \"Crown of Spain\" that was governed solely by Castilian government, notably by the [[Council of Castile]]. Besides, Bourbons established according to the French model, a  \"provincial Intendance\" on their territories, taking the kingdom of Galicia an Intendance, and being under the command of a General Captain.\n\nCultural and linguistic polities were strongly standardizing, according to the centralist conception of the Bourbons, which is expressed in explicit and stringent laws to end the linguistic diversity in the kingdoms (over Bourbons control)  that had a native language different from Castilian:\n\n''Finally, I command that the teaching of the first letters, Latin and rhetoric will only in Castilian language, taking care this compliance the Audiencias and the respective Courts.

In this context began a process of construction and a recovery of consciousness of the historical personality, the cultural and economic diversity of the Kingdom of Galicia due to important Galician Enlightenment writers who knew Galicia as a differentiated society, and as a kingdom with special needs.\n\n[[File:Mart\u00edn Sarmiento.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of [[Mart\u00edn Sarmiento]]]]\nIn the vast task of modernizing the kingdom to use to best advantage their human and natural resources, the Galician societies and academies played a prominent role, such as the ''Academy of Agriculture of the Kingdom of Galicia'' (inaugurated on January 20, 1765), ''The Economic Society of Friends of the Kingdom of Galicia'' (February 15, 1784), and the ''Societies of Friends of the Country to Santiago de Compostela'' (1784) and ''Lugo'' (1785), as well as ambitious proposals such as the ''Royal Fishermen's Pawnshop of the Kingdom of Galicia'' (1775).\n\nThe Enlightenment writers were the first to denounce the difficulties of the kingdom, most of them arising from the negative politics that the kingdom suffered by the Catholic Monarchs and the Habsburgs\u00b4 polities. They began reporting on the state of roads, the unnecessary imports, the mass emigration, the linguistic acculturation polities, and the economic marginalization of the kingdom. Due to their demands, they achieved, among others successes, the constitution of a ''Maritime and Land Consulate'' in A Coru\u00f1a, allowing to the Galicia to trade with the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]].\n\nIn the enormous contribution to language and culture of the kingdom, two [[ecclesiastic]]s stand out, [[Benito Jer\u00f3nimo Feij\u00f3o y Montenegro]] and [[Mart\u00edn Sarmiento]]. Montenegro was the first to denounce the misery of the Galician peasants, proposing changes in the administration of the kingdom. Sarmiento, with extensive knowledge of [[botany]] and [[natural medicine]]s, devoted himself to [[philology]]; he wrote the ''Catalogue of voices and phrases of the Galician language'' (1745\u20131755), and was a great defender of the [[Galician language]], defending it against those who tried discredit it. Economic themes were also highlighted by other Galician aristocrats, such as Joseph Cornide Saavedra, Pedro Antonio S\u00e1nchez, and Lucas Labrada, as well as ecclesiastics like Francisco de Castro, and merchants like Antonio Raimundo Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez. They were all authors of many works of vital importance in economic development, such ''Report on sardine fishing off the coast of Galicia'' (1774), and the ''Economic description of the Kingdom of Galicia'' (1804).\n\n===19th century===\nThe Kingdom of Galicia and the Junta continued to formally exist until the State Liberal Reform of 1833, at the time of the provincial division under the regency of [[Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies]]. Galicia regained its territorial unity for twenty-four days by the constitution of the ''Junta de Gobierno de Galicia'' following a liberal armed uprising in 1846, the [[M\u00e1rtires de Carral]], but never regained the status of a kingdom.\n\n==Culture==\nDue to mythologies surrounding Galicia's history (especially era of the kingdom), the kingdom has been called \"Terra Meiga\" (land of the witches) or \"Reino Meiga\" (kingdom of the witches)<ref>https://santiagoways.com/en/myths-and-legends-of-the-camino-de-santiago/</ref>\n\n==Symbols of the kingdom==\n[[File:TumboA Alfonso.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Romanesque miniature representing [[Alfonso IX of Le\u00f3n|Alfonso IX]], King of Le\u00f3n. In the upper part appears his historic title ''Rex Legionensium et Gallecie'', while the lower part shows the purple lion, symbol of the Leonese monarchy]]\n\n===The purple lion===\nThe custom of painting symbols such as the [[heraldry|heraldic]] shields of war was forged in the battlefields of Europe after the middle decades of the 12th century, due to a confluence of circumstances of different natures. One was the need to differentiate between allies and adversaries on the battlefield, partly due to facial protection in [[Combat helmet#Medieval and early modern militaries|medieval helmets]] obscuring the combatant's faces, but also due to the high ornamental value of decorated shields with bright, crisp, and alternate shapes in the context of the [[Chivalry|chivalrous]] society.\n\nThe first heraldic signs were used by kings as a personal mark to identify himself. Shortly after they began to be shared by the upper social levels close to the royalty, and finally were used to represent the territory in which they exercised their jurisdiction, the kingdom.\n\nOne of the first kings in Europe who made use of a heraldic emblem was the Leonese king, [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n|Alphonse VII]]. At the beginning of the 12th century he began timidly using a purple lion in accordance with its ancient symbolism, as ''Leo Fortis'', the \"strong lion\", symbolized power and primacy of the monarch, but would also have represented a [[canting arms|punning reference]] to the name of his kingdom, Le\u00f3n. The emblem was developed with his son [[Ferdinand II of Le\u00f3n|Ferdinand II]], and was finally established by [[Alfonso IX of Le\u00f3n|Alphonse IX]].\n\n===The Chalice, symbol of the kingdom===\nParallel to the process of development and consolidation of European royal emblems from the late 13th century, collections of them, the ''[[Armorial]]s'', displayed lists of kingdoms and their royal symbols. In the case of Galicia, antiquity and the prominence which the Kingdom had had during centuries saw its inclusion in the early European armorials.  However, the absence of an exclusive symbol for Galician kings, who were also kings of Le\u00f3n since the 12th century, forced to the medieval heraldists to use [[Canting arms]], which was a symbol derived from the [[phonetic]]s of the name.\n\nAn English armorial named ''Segar's Roll'', produced in 1282, was the first Armorial which assigned the chalice as the [[Coat of Arms]] for the King and Kingdom of Galicia (''Roy de Galice''), probably coming directly from the Anglo-Norman word for Galicia, ''Galyce'', which was very close to the word ''Calice'' ([[chalice]]). Following that time, different European armorials began to use the chalice as the emblem of the Kingdom of Galicia.<ref>{{cite book |first=Barreiro |last=Fern\u00e1ndez|editor-first=Xos\u00e9 |editor-last=Ram\u00f3n |title=Os s\u00edmbolos de Galicia|year=2007|publisher=Consello da Cultura Galega|location=Santiago de Compostela|isbn=978-84-96530-46-1|pages=38\u201340|url=http://consellodacultura.org/mediateca/extras/simbolos_de_galicia.pdf}}</ref>  In the mid-15th century, this symbol came to Galicia, where it was easily and readily accepted, as the [[Holy Grail]] was already a symbol widely spread over Europe and already present in Galician history and deepest beliefs.\n\nThereafter, the purple lion of the former Galician-Leonese monarchy lost its representative character in favor of the better known canting arms, being then adopted exclusively by the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n, whilst in Galicia the chalice would develop into the modern coat-of-arms of Galicia.\n<gallery>\nFile:Reino de Galicia - Kingdom of Galicia - Segars Roll.jpg|Arms of the Kings of Galicia, Segar's Roll, 13th century\nFile:Reino de Galicia-kingdom of Galicia-Maximiliano.jpg|Arms of the kingdom of Galicia in the \"Great Triumphal Chariot of Maximilian\", Year 1515.\nFile:Reino de Galicia - Kingdom of Galicia - CarolumV.jpg|Arms of the kingdom of Galicia in the ''Historia originis et succesionis regnorum et imperiorum a Noe usque ad Carolum V'', 1548.\nFile:Reino de Galicia - kingdom of Galicia - Hierosme.jpg|Arms of the kingdom od Galicia, ''Le blason des Armoiries'', Year 1581\nFile:Escudo reino de galicia.jpg|Arms of the Kingdom of Galicia, illustrated in ''L\u00b4armorial Le Blancq'', [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]], 16th century\nFile:Escudo-reyno de galizia.jpg|Arms of the Kingdom of Galicia, Pedro de Teixeira, 17th century\nFile:Cedulareinogaliza.jpg|Comercial Company of the Kingdom of Galicia, 18th century\nFile:Reino_de_Galicia_-kingdom_of_Galicia-troncoso.jpg|Arms of the kingdom of Galicia, ''Galicia.Reino de Christo Sacramentado y primog\u00e9nita de la Iglesia entre las gentes'', Year 1750.\nFile:Escudo de Galicia.svg|Arms of Galicia, today\n</gallery>\n\n==Medieval cartography==\n<gallery caption=\"The Kingdom of Galicia in medieval cartography\" widths=\"175\" heights=\"140\" class=\"center\">\nFile:WesternEurope BeatusOsma.jpg|alt=Burgo de Osma's map|[[Burgo de Osma-Ciudad de Osma, Soria|Burgo de Osma]]\u00b4s map (1086), with the names ''Gallecia'' (occupying the whole Northwest Iberian Peninsula), ''Asturias'' (occupying the Cantabrian linecoast), and ''Spania'' (occupying the rest of Iberia)\nFile:1125 Lambert de Saint Omer Liber Floridus Peninsula Iberica.jpg|alt=Liber Floridus map|In [[Liber Floridus]] (1125), by [[Lambert of Saint-Omer]], showing the names ''Galitia'', ''Hispania'', ''Lusitania'', and ''Wasconia'', among others\nFile:1154 Tabula Rogeriana Al Idrisi transcripcion de Konrad Miller 1928 detalle.jpg|alt=Tabula Rogeriana|In [[Tabula Rogeriana]] (1154), by [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]], showing the name ''Ard Galika''\nFile:1190 Imago Mundi Honorius of Autum (Henry of Mainz) Peninsula Iberica.jpg|alt=The Sawley Map|In [[Imago Mundi]] (1190), by [[Honorius Augustodunensis]], showing the names ''Galicia'' and ''Hispania''\nFile:1234 Convento de Ebstorfer Gervase of Tilbury Gallicia Regio.jpg|alt=Ebstorf Map|Ebstorf Map (1234), showing the name ''Gallicia Regio''\nFile:1320 Pietro Vesconte (Liber Secretorum de Marino Sanuto) Norte Peninsula Iberica.jpg|alt=Pietro Vesconte's map|In ''Liber Secretorum'' (1125), by Marino Sanuto, where the name ''Galitia'' occupies the entire northwestern Iberia\nFile:Galicia in pirrus de noha map.jpg|Pirrus de Noha's map (1414) where Galicia occupies the northwestern Iberia.\nFile:1420 Salustio de Ginebra Peninsula Iberica.jpg|alt=Sallust de Geneve's map|Sallust de Geneve's map (1420), where the name ''Galaecia'' occupies the entire northwestern Iberia\nFile:1475 Rudimentum Novitorum Lucas Brandis occidente europeo.jpg|alt=Lucas Brandis\u00b4 map|In ''Rudimentum Novitorum'' (1475), by Lucas Brandis, showing the names ''Galicia'', ''Hispani'', and ''Anglia'', among others\nFile:Mapa de Borgia XV noroeste Peninsula Iberica.jpg|alt=Borgia's map|Northwest Iberian Peninsula (15th century) with the names ''Galiicia'' and nearby ''infidelis Yspania''\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Arias, Jorge C.
