Arison soon left to form [[Carnival Cruise Lines]], while Kloster acquired additional ships for Caribbean service. Norwegian pioneered many firsts in the cruise industry, such as the first Out Island Cruise, the first combined air-sea program (marketed as \"Cloud 9 Cruises\"), which combined low-cost air fares with the cruise, and first shipline to develop new ports in the Caribbean, such as [[Ocho Rios]] in [[Jamaica]]. Like the original ''Sunward'' of 1966, Norwegians's second ship, the [[MS Starward|''Starward'']], had the capability to carry automobiles through a well-concealed stern door. Later, this area was turned into cabins and a two-deck movie theater, later to be used as a casino. Norwegian was responsible for many of the cruise innovations that have now become standard throughout the industry.\n[[File:SS Norway on \"maiden\" voyage.jpg|thumb|SS ''Norway'' arriving at Southampton]]\nNorwegian made headlines with the acquisition of the [[SS France (1961)|''France'']] in 1979, rebuilding the liner as a cruise ship and renaming her ''[[SS Norway|Norway]]''. The conversion cost more than US$100&nbsp;million. The ''Norway'' was at the time significantly larger than any existing cruise ship, and exploited the extra space available by adding a greater than usual variety of onboard entertainment. Her success paved the way for a new era of giant cruise ships. A boiler explosion in May 2003 forced Norwegian to withdraw the ''Norway'' from service, later being laid up in [[Bremerhaven]], Germany, until 2005, when she was towed to [[Port Klang]] Malaysia with the claimed intent to use her as an anchored casino or slow overnight casino cruises on her remaining boilers.

Arison soon left to form [[Carnival Cruise Lines]], while Kloster acquired additional ships for Caribbean service. Norwegian pioneered many firsts in the cruise industry, such as the first Out Island Cruise, the first combined air-sea program (marketed as \"Cloud 9 Cruises\"), which combined low-cost air fares with the cruise, and first shipline to develop new ports in the Caribbean, such as [[Ocho Rios]] in [[Jamaica]]. Like the original ''Sunward'' of 1966, Norwegians's second ship, the [[MS Starward|''Starward'']], had the capability to carry automobiles through a well-concealed stern door. Later, this area was turned into cabins and a two-deck movie theater, later to be used as a casino. Norwegian was responsible for many of the cruise innovations that have now become standard throughout the industry.\n[[File:SS Norway on \"maiden\" voyage.jpg|thumb|SS ''Norway'' arriving at Southampton]]\nNorwegian made headlines with the acquisition of the [[SS France (1961)|''France'']] in 1979, rebuilding the liner as a cruise ship and renaming her ''[[SS Norway|Norway]]''. The conversion cost more than US$100&nbsp;million. The ''Norway'' was at the time significantly larger than any existing cruise ship, and exploited the extra space available by adding a greater than usual variety of onboard entertainment. Her success paved the way for a new era of giant cruise ships. A boiler explosion in May 2003 forced Norwegian to withdraw the ''Norway'' from service, later being laid up in [[Bremerhaven]], Germany, until 2005, when she was towed to [[Port Klang]] Malaysia with the claimed intent to use her as an anchored casino or slow overnight casino cruises on her remaining boilers.
