For this reason, SSD controllers use a technique called [[wear leveling]] to distribute writes as evenly as possible across all the flash blocks in the SSD.\n\nIn a perfect scenario, this would enable every block to be written to its maximum life so they all fail at the same time. The process to evenly distribute writes requires data previously written and not changing (cold data) to be moved, so that data which are changing more frequently (hot data) can be written into those blocks. Relocating data increases [[write amplification]] and adds to the wear of flash memory. Designers seek to minimize both.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = https://lwn.net/Articles/428584/\n |title       = Optimizing Linux with cheap flash drives\n |date        = 2011-02-18\n |accessdate  = 2013-10-03\n |author      = Arnd Bergmann\n |publisher   = [[LWN.net]]\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131007144837/http://lwn.net/Articles/428584/\n |archivedate = 2013-10-07\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url         = https://lwn.net/Articles/428799/\n |title       = LogFS\n |date        = 2007-05-15\n |accessdate  = 2013-10-03\n |author      = Jonathan Corbet\n |publisher   = [[LWN.net]]\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215514/https://lwn.net/Articles/428799/\n |archivedate = 2013-10-04\n}}</ref>\n\n===Memory===\n\n====Flash memory====\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"width: 30em; margin-left: 1.5em; margin-right: 0;\"\n|+ Comparison of architectures<ref>[http://ssd-festplatte-kaufen.de/slc-und-mlc/ SLC and MLC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405082307/http://ssd-festplatte-kaufen.de/slc-und-mlc/ |date=2013-04-05 }} SSD Festplatten.

The first units were intended to replace or augment hard disk drives, so the operating system recognized them as a hard drive. Originally, solid state drives were even shaped and mounted in the computer like hard drives. Later SSDs became smaller and more compact, eventually developing their own unique form factors such as the [[M.2]] form factor. The SSD was designed to be installed permanently inside a computer.<ref name=\"SanDisk_SSD_CF\"/>\n\nIn contrast, memory cards (such as [[Secure Digital]] (SD), [[CompactFlash]] (CF), and many others) were originally designed for digital cameras and later found their way into cell phones, gaming devices, GPS units, etc. Most memory cards are physically smaller than SSDs, and designed to be inserted and removed repeatedly.<ref name=\"SanDisk_SSD_CF\"/> There are adapters which enable some memory cards to interface to a computer, allowing use as an SSD, but they are not intended to be the primary storage device in the computer.{{citation needed |date=August 2019}} The typical [[CompactFlash]] card interface is three to four times slower than an SSD.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} As memory cards are not designed to tolerate the amount of reading and writing which occurs during typical computer use, their data may get damaged unless special procedures are taken to reduce the wear on the card to a minimum.\n\n== SSD failure ==\n\nSSDs have very different [[failure mode]]s than traditional magnetic hard drives. Because of their design, some kinds of failure are inapplicable (motors or magnetic heads cannot fail, because they are not needed in an SSD). Instead, other kinds of failure are possible (for example, incomplete or failed writes due to sudden power failure can be more of a problem than with HDDs, and if a chip fails then all the data on it is lost, a scenario not applicable to magnetic drives). However, on the whole statistics show that SSDs are generally highly reliable, and often continue working far beyond the expected lifetime as stated by their manufacturer.<ref name=\"2016study\">[http://0b4af6cdc2f0c5998459-c0245c5c937c5dedcca3f1764ecc9b2f.r43.cf2.rackcdn.com/23105-fast16-papers-schroeder.pdf Flash Reliability in Production: The Expected and the Unexpected] - Schroeder, Lagisetty & Merchant, 2016.</ref>\n\n=== SSD reliability and failure modes===\nAn early test by ''[[Techreport.com]]'' which ran for 18 months during 2013 - 2015 had previously tested a number of SSDs to destruction to identify how and at what point they failed; the test found that \"All of the drives surpassed their official endurance specifications by writing hundreds of terabytes without issue\", described as being far beyond any usual size for a \"typical consumer\".<ref name=\"TR2015\">{{cite web|url=https://techreport.com/review/27909/the-ssd-endurance-experiment-theyre-all-dead|title=The SSD Endurance Experiment: They're all dead|first=Geoff|last=Gasior|website=The Tech Report}}</ref> The first SSD to fail was a TLC based drive - a type of design expected to be less durable than either SLC or MLC - and the SSD concerned managed to write over 800,000 GB (800 TB or 0.8 [[petabyte]]s) before failing; three SSDs in the test managed to write almost three times that amount (almost 2.5 PB) before they also failed.<ref name=\"TR2015\"/> So the capability of even consumer SSDs to be remarkably reliable was already established.\n\nA 2016 study<ref name=\"2016study\" /> of \"millions of drive days\" in production use by SSDs over a six-year period, reported that \"4-10%\" of their SSDs were replaced in a 4-year period and concluded based upon annual failure rates of HDDs published in 2007 that SSDs fail at a \"significantly lower\" rate than HDDs; however a 2016 study of 71,940 HDDs (26 million drive days) reported annual failure rates comparable to the reported SSD rates, that is, the HDDs on the average had a calculated four year failure rate of 7.5% and with a lowest rate of 1.6%.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.backblaze.com/blog/hard-drive-stats-for-2018/\n |title=Backblaze Hard Drive Stats for 2018\n |last=Klein\n |first=Andy\n |date=January 19, 2019\n |website=\n |publisher=Backblaze\n |access-date=February 13, 2019\n |quote= The Annualized Failure Rate (AFR) for 2018 for all [hard disk] drive models was just 1.25%, well below the rates from previous years ...}}\nFour year rate calculated from published AFR.</ref>  The 2016 SDD study concluded SSD localized data loss due to unreadable blocks to be more of a problem than with HDDs. It also contained a number of \"unexpected conclusions\"\n\n* In the real world, [[Multi-level cell|MLC]] based designs - believed less reliable than [[Single-level cell|SLC]] designs - are often as reliable as SLC. (The findings state that \"SLC [is] not generally more reliable than MLC\")\n* Device age, measured by days in use, is the main factor in SSD reliability, and not amount of data read or written, which are measured by TBW or DWPD. Because this finding persists after controlling for early failure and other factors, it is likely that factors such as \"silicon aging\" is a cause of this trend. The correlation is significant (around 0.2 - 0.4).\n* Raw bit error rates (RBER) grows much slower than usually believed and is not exponential as often assumed, nor is it a good predictor of other errors or SSD failure.\n* The uncorrectable bit error rate (UBER) is widely used but is not a good predictor of failure either. However SSD UBER rates are higher than those for HDDs, so although they do not predict failure, they can lead to data loss due to unreadable blocks being more common on SSDs than HDDs. The conclusion states that although more reliable overall, the rate of uncorrectable errors able to impact a user is larger.\n* \"Bad blocks in new SSDs are common, and drives with a large number of bad blocks are much more likely to lose hundreds of other blocks, most likely due to die or chip failure. 30-80 percent of SSDs develop at least one bad block and 2-7 percent develop at least one bad chip in the first four years of deployment.\"\n* There is no sharp increase in errors after the expected lifetime is reached.\n* Most SSDs develop no more than a few bad blocks, perhaps 2 - 4. SSDs that develop many bad blocks often go on to develop far more (perhaps hundreds), and may be prone to failure. However most drives (99%+) are shipped with bad blocks from manufacture. The finding overall was that bad blocks are common and 30-80% of drives will develop at least one in use, but even a few bad blocks (2 - 4) is a predictor of up to hundreds of bad blocks at a later time. The bad block count at manufacture correlates with later development of further bad blocks. The report conclusion added that SSDs tended to either have \"less than a handful\" of bad blocks or \"a large number\", and suggested that this might be a basis for predicting eventual failure.\n* Around 2-7% of SSDs will develop bad chips in their first 4 years of use. Over 2/3 of these chips will have breached their manufacturers' tolerances and specifications, which typically guarantee that no more than 2% of blocks on a chip will fail within its expected write lifetime.\n* 96% of those SSDs that need repair (warranty servicing), need repair only once in their life. Days between repair vary from \"a couple of thousand days\" to \"nearly 15,000 days\" depending on the model.\n\n===Data recovery and secure deletion===\nSolid state drives have set new challenges for [[data recovery]] companies, as the way of storing data is non-linear and much more complex than that of hard disk drives. The strategy the drive operates by internally can largely vary between manufacturers, and the TRIM command zeroes the whole range of a deleted file. Wear leveling also means that the physical address of the data and the address exposed to the operating system are different.\n\nAs for secure deletion of data, ATA Secure Erase command could be used. A program such as [[hdparm]] can be used for this purpose.\n\n===Endurance===\nThe ''[[JEDEC Solid State Technology Association]]'' (JEDEC) has published standards for reliability metrics:<ref name=\"NullLobur2014\">{{cite book|last1=Null|first1=Linda|last2=Lobur|first2=Julia|title=The Essentials of Computer Organization and Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GKgxDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT499|date=14 February 2014|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-1-284-15077-3|pages=499\u2013500}}</ref>\n* Unrecoverable Bit Error Ratio (UBER)\n* Terabytes Written (TBW) - The number of terabytes that can be written to a drive within its warranty.\n* Drive Writes Per Day (DWPD) - The number of times the total capacity of the drive may be written to per day within its warranty.\n\n==Applications==\nDue to their generally prohibitive cost versus HDD's at the time, until 2009, SSDs were mainly used in those aspects of [[mission critical]] applications where the speed of the [[computer data storage|storage system]] needed to be as high as possible. Since flash memory has become a common component of SSDs, the falling prices and increased densities have made it more cost-effective for many other applications. For instance, in the [[distributed computing]] environment, SSDs can be used as the building block for a [[distributed cache]] layer that temporarily absorbs the large volume of user requests to the slower HDD based backend storage system. This layer provides much higher bandwidth and lower latency than the storage system, and can be managed in a number of forms, such as distributed [[key-value database]] and distributed [[file system]]. On the supercomputers, this layer is typically referred to as [[burst buffer]]. With this fast layer, users often experience shorter system response time. Organizations that can benefit from faster access of system data include [[equity securities#Trading|equity trading]] companies, [[telecommunication]] corporations, and [[streaming media]] and [[video editing]] firms. The list of applications which could benefit from faster storage is vast.<ref name=\"SNIA-101\"/>\n\nFlash-based solid-state drives can be used to create network appliances from general-purpose [[personal computer]] hardware. A [[write protection|write protected]] flash drive containing the operating system and application software can substitute for larger, less reliable disk drives or CD-ROMs. Appliances built this way can provide an inexpensive alternative to expensive router and firewall hardware.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nSSDs based on an [[SD card]] with a [[live SD]] operating system are easily [[SD card#Optional write-protect tab|write-locked]]. Combined with a [[cloud computing]] environment or other writable medium, to maintain [[persistence (computer science)|persistence]], an [[operating system|OS]] [[booting|booted]] from a write-locked SD card is robust, rugged, reliable, and impervious to permanent corruption. If the running OS degrades, simply turning the machine off and then on returns it back to its initial uncorrupted state and thus is particularly solid. The SD card installed OS does not require removal of corrupted components since it was write-locked though any written media may need to be restored.\n\n===Hard drives caching===\nIn 2011, Intel introduced a caching mechanism for their [[Z68]] chipset (and mobile derivatives) called [[Smart Response Technology]], which allows a [[SATA]] SSD to be used as a [[cache (computing)|cache]] (configurable as write-through or [[write-back]]) for a conventional, magnetic hard disk drive.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/4329/intel-z68-chipset-smart-response-technology-ssd-caching-review/2 |title=Intel Z68 Chipset & Smart Response Technology (SSD Caching) Review |publisher=AnandTech |accessdate=2012-05-06 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505222631/http://www.anandtech.com/show/4329/intel-z68-chipset-smart-response-technology-ssd-caching-review/2 |archivedate=2012-05-05 }}</ref> A similar technology is available on [[HighPoint]]'s RocketHybrid [[PCIe]] card.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/rockethybrid-1220-ssd-caching,2936.html |title=SSD Caching (Without Z68): HighPoint's RocketHybrid 1220 |publisher=Tom's Hardware |date=2011-05-10 |accessdate=2012-05-06}}</ref>\n\n[[Solid-state hybrid drive]]s (SSHDs) are based on the same principle, but integrate some amount of flash memory on board of a conventional drive instead of using a separate SSD. The flash layer in these drives can be accessed independently from the [[magnetic storage]] by the host using [[ATA-8]] commands, allowing the operating system to manage it. For example, Microsoft's [[ReadyDrive]] technology explicitly stores portions of the [[hibernation (computing)#Microsoft Windows|hibernation file]] in the cache of these drives when the system hibernates, making the subsequent resume faster.<ref name=\"RussinovichSolomon2009b\">{{cite book |author1=Mark E.

Examples of this type of system are [[bcache]] and [[dm-cache]] on [[Linux]],<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/advanced-hard-drive-caching-techniques\n |title       = Advanced Hard Drive Caching Techniques\n |date        = 2013-11-25\n |accessdate  = 2013-12-02\n |author      = Petros Koutoupis\n |publisher   = linuxjournal.com\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131202152028/http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/advanced-hard-drive-caching-techniques\n |archivedate = 2013-12-02\n}}</ref> and Apple's [[Fusion Drive]].\n\n=={{anchor|Page alignment|Block alignment|Partition alignment}}File system support for SSDs==\n{{Main|List of file systems#File systems optimized for flash memory, solid state media|l1=File systems optimized for flash memory, solid state media}}\n\nTypically the same [[file system]]s used on hard disk drives can also be used on solid state drives. It is usually expected for the file system to support the [[Trim (computing)|TRIM command]] which helps the SSD to recycle discarded data (support for TRIM arrived some years after SSDs themselves but is now nearly universal). This means that file system does not need to manage [[wear leveling]] or other flash memory characteristics, as they are handled internally by the SSD. Some flash file systems using [[log-structured file system|log-based]] designs ([[F2FS]], [[JFFS2]]) help to reduce write amplification on SSDs, especially in situations where only very small amounts of data are changed, such as when updating [[file system#Metadata|file-system metadata]].\n\nWhile not a file system feature, operating systems should also aim to [[partition alignment|align partitions]] correctly, which avoids excessive [[read-modify-write]] cycles. A typical practice for personal computers is to have each partition aligned to start at a 1&nbsp;[[binary prefix|MiB]] (= 1,048,576 bytes) mark, which covers all common SSD page and block size scenarios, as it is divisible by all commonly used sizes - 1&nbsp;MiB, 512&nbsp;KiB, 128&nbsp;KiB, 4&nbsp;KiB, and 512&nbsp;B. Modern operating system installation software and disk tools handle this automatically.\n\n==={{Anchor|FSTRIM|QUEUED-TRIM}}Linux===\nThe [[ext4]], [[Btrfs]], [[XFS]], [[JFS (file system)|JFS]], and [[F2FS]] file systems include support for the discard (TRIM or UNMAP) function.\n\nKernel support for the TRIM operation was introduced in version 2.6.33 of the Linux kernel mainline, released on {{date|2010-02-24}}.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_33\n |title       = Linux kernel 2.6.33\n |date        = 2010-02-24\n |accessdate  = 2013-11-05\n |website     = kernelnewbies.org\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120616025132/http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_33\n |archivedate = 2012-06-16\n}}</ref> To make use of it, a file system must be mounted using the <code>discard</code> parameter.

Without support for TRIM, the SSD would be unaware of this data being invalid and would unnecessarily continue to rewrite it during garbage collection causing further wear on the SSD. It is beneficial to make some changes that prevent SSDs from being treated more like HDDs, for example cancelling defragmentation, not filling them to more than about 75% of capacity, not storing frequently written-to files such as log and temporary files on them if a hard drive is available, and enabling the TRIM process.<ref>{{cite web |last=Yam |first=Marcus |title=Windows 7 and Optimization for Solid State Drives|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/windows-solid-state-drives-ssd,7717.html |publisher=Tom's Hardware |accessdate=9 August 2010 |date=May 5, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.howtogeek.com/165472/6-things-you-shouldnt-do-with-solid-state-drives/ |title=6 Things You Shouldn't Do With Solid-State Drives |newspaper=Howtogeek.com |accessdate=12 March 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313045015/http://www.howtogeek.com/165472/6-things-you-shouldnt-do-with-solid-state-drives/ |archivedate=13 March 2016 }}</ref>\n\n====Windows 8.1====\nWindows 8.1 and later Windows systems like Windows 10 also support automatic TRIM for PCI Express SSDs based on [[NVM Express|NVMe]].

For this reason, SSD controllers use a technique called [[wear leveling]] to distribute writes as evenly as possible across all the flash blocks in the SSD.\n\nIn a perfect scenario, this would enable every block to be written to its maximum life so they all fail at the same time. The process to evenly distribute writes requires data previously written and not changing (cold data) to be moved, so that data which are changing more frequently (hot data) can be written into those blocks. Relocating data increases [[write amplification]] and adds to the wear of flash memory. Designers seek to minimize both.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = https://lwn.net/Articles/428584/\n |title       = Optimizing Linux with cheap flash drives\n |date        = 2011-02-18\n |accessdate  = 2013-10-03\n |author      = Arnd Bergmann\n |publisher   = [[LWN.net]]\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131007144837/http://lwn.net/Articles/428584/\n |archivedate = 2013-10-07\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url         = https://lwn.net/Articles/428799/\n |title       = LogFS\n |date        = 2007-05-15\n |accessdate  = 2013-10-03\n |author      = Jonathan Corbet\n |publisher   = [[LWN.net]]\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215514/https://lwn.net/Articles/428799/\n |archivedate = 2013-10-04\n}}</ref>\n\n===Memory===\n\n====Flash memory====\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"width: 30em; margin-left: 1.5em; margin-right: 0;\"\n|+ Comparison of architectures<ref>[http://ssd-festplatte-kaufen.de/slc-und-mlc/ SLC and MLC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405082307/http://ssd-festplatte-kaufen.de/slc-und-mlc/ |date=2013-04-05 }} SSD Festplatten.

The first units were intended to replace or augment hard disk drives, so the operating system recognized them as a hard drive. Originally, solid state drives were even shaped and mounted in the computer like hard drives. Later SSDs became smaller and more compact, eventually developing their own unique form factors such as the [[M.2]] form factor. The SSD was designed to be installed permanently inside a computer.<ref name=\"SanDisk_SSD_CF\"/>\n\nIn contrast, memory cards (such as [[Secure Digital]] (SD), [[CompactFlash]] (CF), and many others) were originally designed for digital cameras and later found their way into cell phones, gaming devices, GPS units, etc. Most memory cards are physically smaller than SSDs, and designed to be inserted and removed repeatedly.<ref name=\"SanDisk_SSD_CF\"/> There are adapters which enable some memory cards to interface to a computer, allowing use as an SSD, but they are not intended to be the primary storage device in the computer.{{citation needed |date=August 2019}} The typical [[CompactFlash]] card interface is three to four times slower than an SSD.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} As memory cards are not designed to tolerate the amount of reading and writing which occurs during typical computer use, their data may get damaged unless special procedures are taken to reduce the wear on the card to a minimum.\n\n== SSD failure ==\n\nSSDs have very different [[failure mode]]s than traditional magnetic hard drives. Because of their design, some kinds of failure are inapplicable (motors or magnetic heads cannot fail, because they are not needed in an SSD). Instead, other kinds of failure are possible (for example, incomplete or failed writes due to sudden power failure can be more of a problem than with HDDs, and if a chip fails then all the data on it is lost, a scenario not applicable to magnetic drives). However, on the whole statistics show that SSDs are generally highly reliable, and often continue working far beyond the expected lifetime as stated by their manufacturer.<ref name=\"2016study\">[http://0b4af6cdc2f0c5998459-c0245c5c937c5dedcca3f1764ecc9b2f.r43.cf2.rackcdn.com/23105-fast16-papers-schroeder.pdf Flash Reliability in Production: The Expected and the Unexpected] - Schroeder, Lagisetty & Merchant, 2016.</ref>\n\n=== SSD reliability and failure modes===\nAn early test by ''[[Techreport.com]]'' which ran for 18 months during 2013 - 2015 had previously tested a number of SSDs to destruction to identify how and at what point they failed; the test found that \"All of the drives surpassed their official endurance specifications by writing hundreds of terabytes without issue\", described as being far beyond any usual size for a \"typical consumer\".<ref name=\"TR2015\">{{cite web|url=https://techreport.com/review/27909/the-ssd-endurance-experiment-theyre-all-dead|title=The SSD Endurance Experiment: They're all dead|first=Geoff|last=Gasior|website=The Tech Report}}</ref> The first SSD to fail was a TLC based drive - a type of design expected to be less durable than either SLC or MLC - and the SSD concerned managed to write over 800,000 GB (800 TB or 0.8 [[petabyte]]s) before failing; three SSDs in the test managed to write almost three times that amount (almost 2.5 PB) before they also failed.<ref name=\"TR2015\"/> So the capability of even consumer SSDs to be remarkably reliable was already established.\n\nA 2016 study<ref name=\"2016study\" /> of \"millions of drive days\" in production use by SSDs over a six-year period, reported that \"4-10%\" of their SSDs were replaced in a 4-year period and concluded based upon annual failure rates of HDDs published in 2007 that SSDs fail at a \"significantly lower\" rate than HDDs; however a 2016 study of 71,940 HDDs (26 million drive days) reported annual failure rates comparable to the reported SSD rates, that is, the HDDs on the average had a calculated four year failure rate of 7.5% and with a lowest rate of 1.6%.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.backblaze.com/blog/hard-drive-stats-for-2018/\n |title=Backblaze Hard Drive Stats for 2018\n |last=Klein\n |first=Andy\n |date=January 19, 2019\n |website=\n |publisher=Backblaze\n |access-date=February 13, 2019\n |quote= The Annualized Failure Rate (AFR) for 2018 for all [hard disk] drive models was just 1.25%, well below the rates from previous years ...}}\nFour year rate calculated from published AFR.</ref>  The 2016 SDD study concluded SSD localized data loss due to unreadable blocks to be more of a problem than with HDDs. It also contained a number of \"unexpected conclusions\"\n\n* In the real world, [[Multi-level cell|MLC]] based designs - believed less reliable than [[Single-level cell|SLC]] designs - are often as reliable as SLC. (The findings state that \"SLC [is] not generally more reliable than MLC\")\n* Device age, measured by days in use, is the main factor in SSD reliability, and not amount of data read or written, which are measured by TBW or DWPD. Because this finding persists after controlling for early failure and other factors, it is likely that factors such as \"silicon aging\" is a cause of this trend. The correlation is significant (around 0.2 - 0.4).\n* Raw bit error rates (RBER) grows much slower than usually believed and is not exponential as often assumed, nor is it a good predictor of other errors or SSD failure.\n* The uncorrectable bit error rate (UBER) is widely used but is not a good predictor of failure either. However SSD UBER rates are higher than those for HDDs, so although they do not predict failure, they can lead to data loss due to unreadable blocks being more common on SSDs than HDDs. The conclusion states that although more reliable overall, the rate of uncorrectable errors able to impact a user is larger.\n* \"Bad blocks in new SSDs are common, and drives with a large number of bad blocks are much more likely to lose hundreds of other blocks, most likely due to die or chip failure. 30-80 percent of SSDs develop at least one bad block and 2-7 percent develop at least one bad chip in the first four years of deployment.\"\n* There is no sharp increase in errors after the expected lifetime is reached.\n* Most SSDs develop no more than a few bad blocks, perhaps 2 - 4. SSDs that develop many bad blocks often go on to develop far more (perhaps hundreds), and may be prone to failure. However most drives (99%+) are shipped with bad blocks from manufacture. The finding overall was that bad blocks are common and 30-80% of drives will develop at least one in use, but even a few bad blocks (2 - 4) is a predictor of up to hundreds of bad blocks at a later time. The bad block count at manufacture correlates with later development of further bad blocks. The report conclusion added that SSDs tended to either have \"less than a handful\" of bad blocks or \"a large number\", and suggested that this might be a basis for predicting eventual failure.\n* Around 2-7% of SSDs will develop bad chips in their first 4 years of use. Over 2/3 of these chips will have breached their manufacturers' tolerances and specifications, which typically guarantee that no more than 2% of blocks on a chip will fail within its expected write lifetime.\n* 96% of those SSDs that need repair (warranty servicing), need repair only once in their life. Days between repair vary from \"a couple of thousand days\" to \"nearly 15,000 days\" depending on the model.\n\n===Data recovery and secure deletion===\nSolid state drives have set new challenges for [[data recovery]] companies, as the way of storing data is non-linear and much more complex than that of hard disk drives. The strategy the drive operates by internally can largely vary between manufacturers, and the TRIM command zeroes the whole range of a deleted file. Wear leveling also means that the physical address of the data and the address exposed to the operating system are different.\n\nAs for secure deletion of data, ATA Secure Erase command could be used. A program such as [[hdparm]] can be used for this purpose.\n\n===Endurance===\nThe ''[[JEDEC Solid State Technology Association]]'' (JEDEC) has published standards for reliability metrics:<ref name=\"NullLobur2014\">{{cite book|last1=Null|first1=Linda|last2=Lobur|first2=Julia|title=The Essentials of Computer Organization and Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GKgxDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT499|date=14 February 2014|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-1-284-15077-3|pages=499\u2013500}}</ref>\n* Unrecoverable Bit Error Ratio (UBER)\n* Terabytes Written (TBW) - The number of terabytes that can be written to a drive within its warranty.\n* Drive Writes Per Day (DWPD) - The number of times the total capacity of the drive may be written to per day within its warranty.\n\n==Applications==\nDue to their generally prohibitive cost versus HDD's at the time, until 2009, SSDs were mainly used in those aspects of [[mission critical]] applications where the speed of the [[computer data storage|storage system]] needed to be as high as possible. Since flash memory has become a common component of SSDs, the falling prices and increased densities have made it more cost-effective for many other applications. For instance, in the [[distributed computing]] environment, SSDs can be used as the building block for a [[distributed cache]] layer that temporarily absorbs the large volume of user requests to the slower HDD based backend storage system. This layer provides much higher bandwidth and lower latency than the storage system, and can be managed in a number of forms, such as distributed [[key-value database]] and distributed [[file system]]. On the supercomputers, this layer is typically referred to as [[burst buffer]]. With this fast layer, users often experience shorter system response time. Organizations that can benefit from faster access of system data include [[equity securities#Trading|equity trading]] companies, [[telecommunication]] corporations, and [[streaming media]] and [[video editing]] firms. The list of applications which could benefit from faster storage is vast.<ref name=\"SNIA-101\"/>\n\nFlash-based solid-state drives can be used to create network appliances from general-purpose [[personal computer]] hardware. A [[write protection|write protected]] flash drive containing the operating system and application software can substitute for larger, less reliable disk drives or CD-ROMs. Appliances built this way can provide an inexpensive alternative to expensive router and firewall hardware.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nSSDs based on an [[SD card]] with a [[live SD]] operating system are easily [[SD card#Optional write-protect tab|write-locked]]. Combined with a [[cloud computing]] environment or other writable medium, to maintain [[persistence (computer science)|persistence]], an [[operating system|OS]] [[booting|booted]] from a write-locked SD card is robust, rugged, reliable, and impervious to permanent corruption. If the running OS degrades, simply turning the machine off and then on returns it back to its initial uncorrupted state and thus is particularly solid. The SD card installed OS does not require removal of corrupted components since it was write-locked though any written media may need to be restored.\n\n===Hard drives caching===\nIn 2011, Intel introduced a caching mechanism for their [[Z68]] chipset (and mobile derivatives) called [[Smart Response Technology]], which allows a [[SATA]] SSD to be used as a [[cache (computing)|cache]] (configurable as write-through or [[write-back]]) for a conventional, magnetic hard disk drive.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/4329/intel-z68-chipset-smart-response-technology-ssd-caching-review/2 |title=Intel Z68 Chipset & Smart Response Technology (SSD Caching) Review |publisher=AnandTech |accessdate=2012-05-06 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505222631/http://www.anandtech.com/show/4329/intel-z68-chipset-smart-response-technology-ssd-caching-review/2 |archivedate=2012-05-05 }}</ref> A similar technology is available on [[HighPoint]]'s RocketHybrid [[PCIe]] card.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/rockethybrid-1220-ssd-caching,2936.html |title=SSD Caching (Without Z68): HighPoint's RocketHybrid 1220 |publisher=Tom's Hardware |date=2011-05-10 |accessdate=2012-05-06}}</ref>\n\n[[Solid-state hybrid drive]]s (SSHDs) are based on the same principle, but integrate some amount of flash memory on board of a conventional drive instead of using a separate SSD. The flash layer in these drives can be accessed independently from the [[magnetic storage]] by the host using [[ATA-8]] commands, allowing the operating system to manage it. For example, Microsoft's [[ReadyDrive]] technology explicitly stores portions of the [[hibernation (computing)#Microsoft Windows|hibernation file]] in the cache of these drives when the system hibernates, making the subsequent resume faster.<ref name=\"RussinovichSolomon2009b\">{{cite book |author1=Mark E.

Examples of this type of system are [[bcache]] and [[dm-cache]] on [[Linux]],<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/advanced-hard-drive-caching-techniques\n |title       = Advanced Hard Drive Caching Techniques\n |date        = 2013-11-25\n |accessdate  = 2013-12-02\n |author      = Petros Koutoupis\n |publisher   = linuxjournal.com\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131202152028/http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/advanced-hard-drive-caching-techniques\n |archivedate = 2013-12-02\n}}</ref> and Apple's [[Fusion Drive]].\n\n=={{anchor|Page alignment|Block alignment|Partition alignment}}File system support for SSDs==\n{{Main|List of file systems#File systems optimized for flash memory, solid state media|l1=File systems optimized for flash memory, solid state media}}\n\nTypically the same [[file system]]s used on hard disk drives can also be used on solid state drives. It is usually expected for the file system to support the [[Trim (computing)|TRIM command]] which helps the SSD to recycle discarded data (support for TRIM arrived some years after SSDs themselves but is now nearly universal). This means that file system does not need to manage [[wear leveling]] or other flash memory characteristics, as they are handled internally by the SSD. Some flash file systems using [[log-structured file system|log-based]] designs ([[F2FS]], [[JFFS2]]) help to reduce write amplification on SSDs, especially in situations where only very small amounts of data are changed, such as when updating [[file system#Metadata|file-system metadata]].\n\nWhile not a file system feature, operating systems should also aim to [[partition alignment|align partitions]] correctly, which avoids excessive [[read-modify-write]] cycles. A typical practice for personal computers is to have each partition aligned to start at a 1&nbsp;[[binary prefix|MiB]] (= 1,048,576 bytes) mark, which covers all common SSD page and block size scenarios, as it is divisible by all commonly used sizes - 1&nbsp;MiB, 512&nbsp;KiB, 128&nbsp;KiB, 4&nbsp;KiB, and 512&nbsp;B. Modern operating system installation software and disk tools handle this automatically.\n\n==={{Anchor|FSTRIM|QUEUED-TRIM}}Linux===\nThe [[ext4]], [[Btrfs]], [[XFS]], [[JFS (file system)|JFS]], and [[F2FS]] file systems include support for the discard (TRIM or UNMAP) function.\n\nKernel support for the TRIM operation was introduced in version 2.6.33 of the Linux kernel mainline, released on {{date|2010-02-24}}.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_33\n |title       = Linux kernel 2.6.33\n |date        = 2010-02-24\n |accessdate  = 2013-11-05\n |website     = kernelnewbies.org\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120616025132/http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_33\n |archivedate = 2012-06-16\n}}</ref> To make use of it, a file system must be mounted using the <code>discard</code> parameter.

Without support for TRIM, the SSD would be unaware of this data being invalid and would unnecessarily continue to rewrite it during garbage collection causing further wear on the SSD. It is beneficial to make some changes that prevent SSDs from being treated more like HDDs, for example cancelling defragmentation, not filling them to more than about 75% of capacity, not storing frequently written-to files such as log and temporary files on them if a hard drive is available, and enabling the TRIM process.<ref>{{cite web |last=Yam |first=Marcus |title=Windows 7 and Optimization for Solid State Drives|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/windows-solid-state-drives-ssd,7717.html |publisher=Tom's Hardware |accessdate=9 August 2010 |date=May 5, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.howtogeek.com/165472/6-things-you-shouldnt-do-with-solid-state-drives/ |title=6 Things You Shouldn't Do With Solid-State Drives |newspaper=Howtogeek.com |accessdate=12 March 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313045015/http://www.howtogeek.com/165472/6-things-you-shouldnt-do-with-solid-state-drives/ |archivedate=13 March 2016 }}</ref>\n\n====Windows 8.1====\nWindows 8.1 and later Windows systems like Windows 10 also support automatic TRIM for PCI Express SSDs based on [[NVM Express|NVMe]].

It is a particular case of the [[gamma distribution]]. It is the continuous analogue of the [[geometric distribution]], and it has the key property of being [[memoryless]].

The following parameterization of the gamma probability density function is useful:\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{Gamma}(\\lambda; \\alpha, \\beta) = \\frac{\\beta^{\\alpha}}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)} \\lambda^{\\alpha-1} \\exp(-\\lambda\\beta). </math>\n\nThe [[posterior distribution]] ''p'' can then be expressed in terms of the likelihood function defined above and a gamma prior:\n\n:<math> \\begin{align}\np(\\lambda) &\\propto L(\\lambda) \\times \\Gamma(\\lambda; \\alpha, \\beta) \\\\\n&= \\lambda^n \\exp\\left (-\\lambda n\\overline{x} \\right) \\times \\frac{\\beta^{\\alpha}}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)} \\lambda^{\\alpha-1} \\exp(-\\lambda \\beta) \\\\\n&\\propto \\lambda^{(\\alpha+n)-1} \\exp(-\\lambda \\left (\\beta + n\\overline{x} \\right)).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nNow the posterior density ''p'' has been specified up to a missing normalizing constant.  Since it has the form of a gamma pdf, this can easily be filled in, and one obtains:\n\n:<math> p(\\lambda) = \\Gamma(\\lambda; \\alpha + n, \\beta + n \\overline{x}). </math>\n\nHere the [[hyperparameter]] \u03b1 can be interpreted as the number of prior observations, and \u03b2 as the sum of the prior observations.\nThe posterior mean here is:\n\n:<math> \\frac{\\alpha + n}{\\beta + n \\overline{x}}. </math>\n\n\n==Occurrence and applications==\n\n===Occurrence of events===\nThe exponential distribution occurs naturally when describing the lengths of the inter-arrival times in a homogeneous [[Poisson process]].\n\nThe exponential distribution may be viewed as a continuous counterpart of the [[geometric distribution]], which describes the number of [[Bernoulli trial]]s necessary for a ''discrete'' process to change state. In contrast, the exponential distribution describes the time for a continuous process to change state.\n\nIn real-world scenarios, the assumption of a constant rate (or probability per unit time) is rarely satisfied. For example, the rate of incoming phone calls differs according to the time of day. But if we focus on a time interval during which the rate is roughly constant, such as from 2 to 4 p.m. during work days, the exponential distribution can be used as a good approximate model for the time until the next phone call arrives. Similar caveats apply to the following examples which yield approximately exponentially distributed variables:\n\n* The time until a radioactive [[particle decay]]s, or the time between clicks of a [[Geiger counter]]\n* The time it takes before your next telephone call\n* The time until default (on payment to company debt holders) in reduced form credit risk modeling\n\nExponential variables can also be used to model situations where certain events occur with a constant probability per unit length, such as the distance between [[mutation]]s on a [[DNA]] strand, or between [[roadkill]]s on a given road.\n\nIn [[queuing theory]], the service times of agents in a system (e.g. how long it takes for a bank teller etc. to serve a customer) are often modeled as exponentially distributed variables.  (The arrival of customers for instance is also modeled by the [[Poisson distribution]] if the arrivals are independent and distributed identically.)  The length of a process that can be thought of as a sequence of several independent tasks follows the [[Erlang distribution]] (which is the distribution of the sum of several independent exponentially distributed variables).\n[[Reliability theory]] and [[reliability engineering]] also make extensive use of the exponential distribution. Because of the ''[[#Memorylessness|memoryless]]'' property of this distribution, it is well-suited to model the constant [[hazard rate]] portion of the [[bathtub curve]] used in reliability theory. It is also very convenient because it is so easy to add [[failure rate]]s in a reliability model. The exponential distribution is however not appropriate to model the overall lifetime of organisms or technical devices, because the \"failure rates\" here are not constant: more failures occur for very young and for very old systems.\n[[File:FitExponDistr.tif|thumb|260px|Fitted cumulative exponential distribution to annually maximum 1-day rainfalls using [[CumFreq]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waterlog.info/cumfreq.htm| title=Cumfreq, a free computer program for cumulative frequency analysis}}</ref>]]\n\nIn [[physics]], if you observe a [[gas]] at a fixed [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] in a uniform [[gravitational field]], the heights of the various molecules also follow an approximate exponential distribution, known as the [[Barometric formula]]. This is a consequence of the entropy property mentioned below.\n\nIn [[hydrology]], the exponential distribution is used to analyze extreme values of such variables as monthly and annual maximum values of daily rainfall and river discharge volumes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ritzema (ed.)|first=H.P.|title=Frequency and Regression Analysis|year=1994|publisher=Chapter 6 in: Drainage Principles and Applications, Publication 16, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands|pages=[https://archive.org/details/drainageprincipl0000unse/page/175 175\u2013224]|url=https://archive.org/details/drainageprincipl0000unse/page/175|isbn=90-70754-33-9}}</ref>\n\n:The blue picture illustrates an example of fitting the exponential distribution to ranked annually maximum one-day rainfalls showing also the 90% [[confidence belt]] based on the [[binomial distribution]]. The rainfall data are represented by [[plotting position]]s as part of the [[cumulative frequency analysis]].\n\n===Prediction===\nHaving observed a sample of ''n'' data points from an unknown exponential distribution a common task is to use these samples to make predictions about future data from the same source. A common predictive distribution over future samples is the so-called plug-in distribution, formed by plugging a suitable estimate for the rate parameter ''\u03bb'' into the exponential density function. A common choice of estimate is the one provided by the principle of maximum likelihood, and using this yields the predictive density over a future sample ''x''<sub>''n''+1</sub>, conditioned on the observed samples ''x'' = (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x<sub>n</sub>'') given by\n\n:<math>p_{\\rm ML}(x_{n+1} \\mid x_1, \\ldots, x_n) = \\left( \\frac1{\\overline{x}} \\right) \\exp \\left( - \\frac{x_{n+1}}{\\overline{x}} \\right)</math>\n\nThe Bayesian approach provides a predictive distribution which takes into account the uncertainty of the estimated parameter, although this may depend crucially on the choice of prior.\n\nA predictive distribution free of the issues of choosing priors that arise under the subjective Bayesian approach is\n\n:<math>p_{\\rm CNML}(x_{n+1} \\mid x_1, \\ldots, x_n) = \\frac{ n^{n+1} \\left( \\overline{x} \\right)^n }{ \\left( n \\overline{x} + x_{n+1} \\right)^{n+1} },</math>\n\nwhich can be considered as\n# a frequentist [[confidence distribution]], obtained from the distribution of the pivotal quantity <math>{x_{n+1}}/{\\overline{x}}</math>;<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lawless |first=J.

It is a particular case of the [[gamma distribution]]. It is the continuous analogue of the [[geometric distribution]], and it has the key property of being [[memoryless]]. In addition to being used for the analysis of Poisson point processes it is found in various other contexts.\n\nThe exponential distribution is not the same as the class of [[exponential family|exponential families]] of distributions, which is a large class of probability distributions that includes the exponential distribution as one of its members, but also includes the [[normal distribution]], [[binomial distribution]], [[gamma distribution]], [[Poisson distribution|Poisson]], and many others.\n\n==Definitions==\n\n===Probability density function===\nThe [[probability density function]] (pdf) of an exponential distribution is\n\n:<math> f(x;\\lambda) = \\begin{cases}\n\\lambda e^{-\\lambda x} & x \\ge 0, \\\\\n0 & x < 0.\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nHere ''\u03bb'' > 0 is the parameter of the distribution, often called the ''rate parameter''.

The following parameterization of the gamma probability density function is useful:\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{Gamma}(\\lambda; \\alpha, \\beta) = \\frac{\\beta^{\\alpha}}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)} \\lambda^{\\alpha-1} \\exp(-\\lambda\\beta). </math>\n\nThe [[posterior distribution]] ''p'' can then be expressed in terms of the likelihood function defined above and a gamma prior:\n\n:<math> \\begin{align}\np(\\lambda) &\\propto L(\\lambda) \\times \\Gamma(\\lambda; \\alpha, \\beta) \\\\\n&= \\lambda^n \\exp\\left (-\\lambda n\\overline{x} \\right) \\times \\frac{\\beta^{\\alpha}}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)} \\lambda^{\\alpha-1} \\exp(-\\lambda \\beta) \\\\\n&\\propto \\lambda^{(\\alpha+n)-1} \\exp(-\\lambda \\left (\\beta + n\\overline{x} \\right)).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nNow the posterior density ''p'' has been specified up to a missing normalizing constant.  Since it has the form of a gamma pdf, this can easily be filled in, and one obtains:\n\n:<math> p(\\lambda) = \\Gamma(\\lambda; \\alpha + n, \\beta + n \\overline{x}). </math>\n\nHere the [[hyperparameter]] \u03b1 can be interpreted as the number of prior observations, and \u03b2 as the sum of the prior observations.\nThe posterior mean here is:\n\n:<math> \\frac{\\alpha + n}{\\beta + n \\overline{x}}. </math>\n\n\n==Occurrence and applications==\n\n===Occurrence of events===\nThe exponential distribution occurs naturally when describing the lengths of the inter-arrival times in a homogeneous [[Poisson process]].\n\nThe exponential distribution may be viewed as a continuous counterpart of the [[geometric distribution]], which describes the number of [[Bernoulli trial]]s necessary for a ''discrete'' process to change state. In contrast, the exponential distribution describes the time for a continuous process to change state.\n\nIn real-world scenarios, the assumption of a constant rate (or probability per unit time) is rarely satisfied. For example, the rate of incoming phone calls differs according to the time of day. But if we focus on a time interval during which the rate is roughly constant, such as from 2 to 4 p.m. during work days, the exponential distribution can be used as a good approximate model for the time until the next phone call arrives. Similar caveats apply to the following examples which yield approximately exponentially distributed variables:\n\n* The time until a radioactive [[particle decay]]s, or the time between clicks of a [[Geiger counter]]\n* The time it takes before your next telephone call\n* The time until default (on payment to company debt holders) in reduced form credit risk modeling\n\nExponential variables can also be used to model situations where certain events occur with a constant probability per unit length, such as the distance between [[mutation]]s on a [[DNA]] strand, or between [[roadkill]]s on a given road.\n\nIn [[queuing theory]], the service times of agents in a system (e.g. how long it takes for a bank teller etc. to serve a customer) are often modeled as exponentially distributed variables.  (The arrival of customers for instance is also modeled by the [[Poisson distribution]] if the arrivals are independent and distributed identically.)  The length of a process that can be thought of as a sequence of several independent tasks follows the [[Erlang distribution]] (which is the distribution of the sum of several independent exponentially distributed variables).\n[[Reliability theory]] and [[reliability engineering]] also make extensive use of the exponential distribution. Because of the ''[[#Memorylessness|memoryless]]'' property of this distribution, it is well-suited to model the constant [[hazard rate]] portion of the [[bathtub curve]] used in reliability theory. It is also very convenient because it is so easy to add [[failure rate]]s in a reliability model. The exponential distribution is however not appropriate to model the overall lifetime of organisms or technical devices, because the \"failure rates\" here are not constant: more failures occur for very young and for very old systems.\n[[File:FitExponDistr.tif|thumb|260px|Fitted cumulative exponential distribution to annually maximum 1-day rainfalls using [[CumFreq]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waterlog.info/cumfreq.htm| title=Cumfreq, a free computer program for cumulative frequency analysis}}</ref>]]\n\nIn [[physics]], if you observe a [[gas]] at a fixed [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] in a uniform [[gravitational field]], the heights of the various molecules also follow an approximate exponential distribution, known as the [[Barometric formula]].

A common predictive distribution over future samples is the so-called plug-in distribution, formed by plugging a suitable estimate for the rate parameter ''\u03bb'' into the exponential density function. A common choice of estimate is the one provided by the principle of maximum likelihood, and using this yields the predictive density over a future sample ''x''<sub>''n''+1</sub>, conditioned on the observed samples ''x'' = (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x<sub>n</sub>'') given by\n\n:<math>p_{\\rm ML}(x_{n+1} \\mid x_1, \\ldots, x_n) = \\left( \\frac1{\\overline{x}} \\right) \\exp \\left( - \\frac{x_{n+1}}{\\overline{x}} \\right)</math>\n\nThe Bayesian approach provides a predictive distribution which takes into account the uncertainty of the estimated parameter, although this may depend crucially on the choice of prior.\n\nA predictive distribution free of the issues of choosing priors that arise under the subjective Bayesian approach is\n\n:<math>p_{\\rm CNML}(x_{n+1} \\mid x_1, \\ldots, x_n) = \\frac{ n^{n+1} \\left( \\overline{x} \\right)^n }{ \\left( n \\overline{x} + x_{n+1} \\right)^{n+1} },</math>\n\nwhich can be considered as\n# a frequentist [[confidence distribution]], obtained from the distribution of the pivotal quantity <math>{x_{n+1}}/{\\overline{x}}</math>;<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lawless |first=J.

The [[Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence]] is a commonly used, parameterisation free measure of the difference between two distributions. Letting \u0394(''\u03bb''<sub>0</sub>||''p'') denote the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence between an exponential with rate parameter ''\u03bb''<sub>0</sub> and a predictive distribution ''p'' it can be shown that\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{E}_{\\lambda_0} \\left[ \\Delta(\\lambda_0\\parallel p_{\\rm ML}) \\right] &= \\psi(n) + \\frac{1}{n-1} - \\log(n) \\\\\n\\operatorname{E}_{\\lambda_0} \\left[ \\Delta(\\lambda_0\\parallel p_{\\rm CNML}) \\right] &= \\psi(n) + \\frac{1}{n} - \\log(n)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere the expectation is taken with respect to the exponential distribution with rate parameter {{nowrap|''\u03bb''<sub>0</sub> \u2208 (0, \u221e)}}, and {{nowrap|\u03c8( \u00b7 )}} is the digamma function.
