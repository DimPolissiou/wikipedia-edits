It was founded in 1971 by the merger of St. Benedict's College (founded 1858) for men and Mount St. Scholastica College (founded 1923) for women. It is located on [[Hill|bluffs]] overlooking the [[Missouri River]], northwest of [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. Benedictine is one of a number of [[List of Benedictine colleges and universities|U.S. Benedictine colleges]] and is sponsored by [[St. Benedict's Abbey]] and Mount St. Scholastica Monastery. The abbey has a current population of 53 monks, while the Mount monastery numbers 147 community members. The college has built its core values around four \"pillars\" \u2014 Catholic, Benedictine, Liberal Arts, Residential \u2014 which support the Benedictine College mission to educate men and women in a community of faith and scholarship.\n\n==History==\nBenedictine College celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/bcravens/docs/sesquicentennialrr|title=Sesquicentennial Raven Review Benedictine College|website=Issuu}}</ref> The present-day college was formed in 1971 by the merger of '''St. Benedict's College''', a men's college, and '''Mount St. Scholastica College''', a women's college.\n\nAt the request of Most Rev. [[John Baptist Mi\u00e8ge|John B. Mi\u00e8ge]], [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]], Vicar Apostolic of Leavenworth, two Benedictine monks arrived in [[Atchison, Kansas|Atchison]] from [[Doniphan, Kansas|Doniphan]] and opened St. Benedict's College, a boarding school, in 1858. It was named for [[Benedict of Nursia]], founder of modern western [[monasticism]]. The mainly [[Classics|classical]] school curriculum was intended to prepare students for the priesthood. The monks, who had recently arrived in the [[Kansas Territory]], then moved their community to Atchison and founded the present-day St. Benedict's Abbey. It expanded to include commerce subjects to cater to the needs of the local population, which was primarily pioneers and settlers. Over the years the college continued to expand and by 1927 it was an accredited four-year [[liberal arts college]].\n\nIn 1863 the Benedictine Sisters of Mount St. Scholastica, whose namesake is [[Benedict of Nursia]]'s twin sister [[Scholastica]], arrived in Atchison and founded St. Scholastica's Academy (now [[Maur Hill \u2013 Mount Academy]]) for local young women. In 1924 Mount St. Scholastica's Junior College was opened so these young women could continue their tertiary education. It became a senior college in 1932 and was authorized to confer [[bachelor degree]]s.\n\nIn 1970, Fr. Alcuin Hemmen, OSB, president of St. Benedict's College, announced that St. Benedict's would become a co-educational college. Sr. Mary Noel Walter, OSB, president of Mount St. Scholastica College had been proposing a merger of the two colleges for over a year. Following Fr. Alcuin's announcement, Sr. Mary Noel organized discussion of a merger.<ref>Sounds & Silence: The Magic of Music from Price Villa. 1863\u20132000. Copyright 2003, Mount St. Scholastica.</ref> It was agreed upon, and the universities merged on July 1, 1971 to form the current Benedictine College. The separate colleges' corporations remain in existence for scholarships and land ownership purposes<ref>[http://www.benedictine.edu/about/benedictine-heritage The 1971 merger of '''Mount St. Scholastica College''' and '''St. Benedict's College''' to form Benedictine College]</ref> and allowed the newly formed college a free 50-year lease of the separate colleges' facilities on their campuses. Benedictine College terminated the lease of the facilities from Mount St. Scholastica College on October 1, 1989 amidst financial hardship.<ref>The Circuit, October 1989.

The college features two performance spaces: the Mabee Theatre seats approximately 130 and the O'Malley-McAllister Auditorium seats around 545 people. The Abbey Church and St. Scholastica chapel at Mount St. Scholastica Monastery are also utilized for organ recitals, orchestra, and choral performances.\n\nThe college's music department traces its roots to Mount St. Scholastica Academy, now [[Maur Hill - Mount Academy]], when in 1863 the Benedictine sisters were said to have first purchased a house and then a piano. The music department of the college was one of the first cooperative departments between the former two colleges, having been formed in 1964.\n\n==Faith life==\nMass is offered to students three times daily in several places, including St. Benedict's Abbey in its Abbey Church, St. Benedict's Church (a parish connected to one of the campus dorms, Elizabeth Hall), and Guadalupe chapel (located in the Abbey Crypt under the main church).

It was founded in 1971 by the merger of St. Benedict's College (founded 1858) for men and Mount St. Scholastica College (founded 1923) for women. It is located on [[Hill|bluffs]] overlooking the [[Missouri River]], northwest of [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. Benedictine is one of a number of [[List of Benedictine colleges and universities|U.S. Benedictine colleges]] and is sponsored by [[St. Benedict's Abbey]] and Mount St. Scholastica Monastery. The abbey has a current population of 53 monks, while the Mount monastery numbers 147 community members. The college has built its core values around four \"pillars\" \u2014 Catholic, Benedictine, Liberal Arts, Residential \u2014 which support the Benedictine College mission to educate men and women in a community of faith and scholarship.\n\n==History==\nBenedictine College celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/bcravens/docs/sesquicentennialrr|title=Sesquicentennial Raven Review Benedictine College|website=Issuu}}</ref> The present-day college was formed in 1971 by the merger of '''St. Benedict's College''', a men's college, and '''Mount St. Scholastica College''', a women's college.\n\nAt the request of Most Rev. [[John Baptist Mi\u00e8ge|John B. Mi\u00e8ge]], [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]], Vicar Apostolic of Leavenworth, two Benedictine monks arrived in [[Atchison, Kansas|Atchison]] from [[Doniphan, Kansas|Doniphan]] and opened St. Benedict's College, a boarding school, in 1858. It was named for [[Benedict of Nursia]], founder of modern western [[monasticism]]. The mainly [[Classics|classical]] school curriculum was intended to prepare students for the priesthood. The monks, who had recently arrived in the [[Kansas Territory]], then moved their community to Atchison and founded the present-day St. Benedict's Abbey. It expanded to include commerce subjects to cater to the needs of the local population, which was primarily pioneers and settlers. Over the years the college continued to expand and by 1927 it was an accredited four-year [[liberal arts college]].\n\nIn 1863 the Benedictine Sisters of Mount St. Scholastica, whose namesake is [[Benedict of Nursia]]'s twin sister [[Scholastica]], arrived in Atchison and founded St. Scholastica's Academy (now [[Maur Hill \u2013 Mount Academy]]) for local young women. In 1924 Mount St. Scholastica's Junior College was opened so these young women could continue their tertiary education. It became a senior college in 1932 and was authorized to confer [[bachelor degree]]s.\n\nIn 1970, Fr. Alcuin Hemmen, OSB, president of St. Benedict's College, announced that St. Benedict's would become a co-educational college. Sr. Mary Noel Walter, OSB, president of Mount St. Scholastica College had been proposing a merger of the two colleges for over a year. Following Fr. Alcuin's announcement, Sr. Mary Noel organized discussion of a merger.<ref>Sounds & Silence: The Magic of Music from Price Villa. 1863\u20132000. Copyright 2003, Mount St. Scholastica.</ref> It was agreed upon, and the universities merged on July 1, 1971 to form the current Benedictine College.

Benedictine College terminated the lease of the facilities from Mount St. Scholastica College on October 1, 1989 amidst financial hardship.<ref>The Circuit, October 1989.
