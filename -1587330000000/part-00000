Stylistically, she gravitated at an early age to artists and mentors whose art were also imbued by a mystical or magical vision.\n\nAs a teenager and young adult, she trained in and studied theater, drama and film. At sixteen years of age, Zeena passed the [[HSED|High School equivalency exam]], which enabled her to leave High School early, begin working legally and enroll in [[City College of San Francisco]], majoring in Drama.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Zeena Schreck for The Guardsman, SF City College Newspaper|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161029132331/http://theguardsman.com/zeena-schreck-advocates-free-education/}}</ref> In addition to [[City College of San Francisco|CCSF]]'s Drama Department, she also received instruction from [[Stella Adler Studio of Acting]], [[Eric Morris (actor)|Eric Morris]] acting coach, [[Viola Spolin]]'s student Marcia Kimmell of The Next Stage Improvisation Theater San Francisco, and the [[American Conservatory Theater|San Francisco School of Dramatic Arts]]. Her study focus was [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Hellenic sacred drama]], [[Improvisational theatre|improvisation]], and various branches of the [[Konstantin Stanislavski|Stanislavski]] [[Stanislavski's system|'system']] and [[method acting]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Zeena Schreck: Theatrical Appearances/Training|url=http://www.zeena.eu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=70&Itemid=84}}</ref>\n\nThe importance of lineage as a vehicle for passing down metaphysical energy guides Zeena's ritual art.

It started with the publication of the now-discredited memoir ''[[Michelle Remembers]]'' in 1980, and culminated in the [[McMartin preschool trial]], a heavily publicized trial which ran from 1984 to 1990, during which prosecutors, through aggressive and [[leading question]]s, managed to get over 300 of the preschool's children to testify that they had been sexually abused by their teachers as part of Satanic rituals. The charges were all eventually dropped. Media coverage during the trial tended to side with the prosecutors, and often singled out the Church of Satan as the culprit. This led Zeena to volunteer to serve as the Church of Satan's first spokesperson.<ref>{{cite episode|series=KJTV| title = KJTV Interviews Zeena LaVey | location = Los Angeles, California | airdate = 1987}}</ref> In a September 2011 interview, Zeena recalled,\n\n{{quote|In 1985, a US news show called ''[[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]]'' accused The Satanic Bible of being responsible for child daycare Satanic ritual abuse, allegations which were new then. ...

It wasn't anything he needed to worry about. He certainly wasn't going out in public to do anything about it. He admitted that many media sources had already contacted him and he was just going to ignore it until it went away. I tried to convince him that this would only get worse if he didn't respond and that he really needed to get someone to answer calls quickly or it would be taken as an admission of guilt or suspicion. Finally he admitted he had no one to deal with interviews or media. I offered to help ''temporarily''  until he found someone.

She also called the testimony of claimants involved into question, asking them rhetorically why, if people were being forced to give birth to babies for sacrificial rituals, no remains had ever been found.\n\nIn 1989, Anton LaVey's 1971 book ''The Compleat Witch, or What to Do When Virtue Fails'' was reprinted as ''[[The Satanic Witch]]'', with an introduction by Zeena. She toured the U.S. promoting her father's work in his absence, as he was no longer interested in making media appearances.<ref>{{cite web|title=KFI-AM 640 Radio Interview with Z.

''In Pursuit of Satan'' began the wave of authoritative reports debunking the Satanic Panic. Much of what Hicks gleaned from Zeena's dialogs with him was included in this treatise.

According to Zeena's official web site, \"In the process of defending the Church of Satan from these unfounded claims in the U.S. mass media, Zeena's media appearances attracted a new upsurge of membership to the formerly moribund organization even as she began to question and ultimately reject the self-centered philosophy she promoted. As she toured the United States on behalf of the Church of Satan, Zeena's crisis of faith reached its highpoint when she learned that most of her father's self-created legend was based on lies and that many of his works were plagiarized. When jealousy and spite motivated Anton LaVey and his administrator [[Blanche Barton|Densley-Barton]] to actually endanger Zeena's life, she could no longer continue to cover up her progenitor's true character in good conscience. This behind the scenes tension should be kept in mind when viewing or hearing Zeena's interviews from that time.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=1990 Zeena Schreck Interview collection|url=http://www.zeena.eu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=75%3Aqzeena-lavey-radio-interviews-three-volume-setq&catid=36&Itemid=81}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Zeena's homepage, remaining members of the Church of Satan and the LaVey family \"reacted to her resignation by indulging in a typical cult-like character assassination campaign against her.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Internet Archive |title=Zeena Schreck homepage |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191223012432/http://zeena.eu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=45&Itemid=70}}</ref> Particularly active in the hostility against Zeena were [[Blanche Barton]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Blanche Barton letter on Zeena Schreck to the Village Voice|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2002-08-27/specials/letters/}}</ref> [[Peter H.

It started with the publication of the now-discredited memoir ''[[Michelle Remembers]]'' in 1980, and culminated in the [[McMartin preschool trial]], a heavily publicized trial which ran from 1984 to 1990, during which prosecutors, through aggressive and [[leading question]]s, managed to get over 300 of the preschool's children to testify that they had been sexually abused by their teachers as part of Satanic rituals. The charges were all eventually dropped. Media coverage during the trial tended to side with the prosecutors, and often singled out the Church of Satan as the culprit. This led Zeena to volunteer to serve as the Church of Satan's first spokesperson.<ref>{{cite episode|series=KJTV| title = KJTV Interviews Zeena LaVey | location = Los Angeles, California | airdate = 1987}}</ref> In a September 2011 interview, Zeena recalled,\n\n{{quote|In 1985, a US news show called ''[[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]]'' accused The Satanic Bible of being responsible for child daycare Satanic ritual abuse, allegations which were new then. ... I called my father and asked him what his media strategy would be to deal with this catastrophe. Nothing. He didn't care. As far as he was concerned it didn't concern him. It wasn't anything he needed to worry about. He certainly wasn't going out in public to do anything about it. He admitted that many media sources had already contacted him and he was just going to ignore it until it went away.

According to Zeena's official web site, \"In the process of defending the Church of Satan from these unfounded claims in the U.S. mass media, Zeena's media appearances attracted a new upsurge of membership to the formerly moribund organization even as she began to question and ultimately reject the self-centered philosophy she promoted. As she toured the United States on behalf of the Church of Satan, Zeena's crisis of faith reached its highpoint when she learned that most of her father's self-created legend was based on lies and that many of his works were plagiarized. When jealousy and spite motivated Anton LaVey and his administrator [[Blanche Barton|Densley-Barton]] to actually endanger Zeena's life, she could no longer continue to cover up her progenitor's true character in good conscience.

Bharoocha lit incense that swept through the audience as Zeena's commanding gaze pierced us all (everyone I talked to after the show swore she was staring directly at them).\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Left Hand Path Leads to Performa 13 by David Sanderson|url=http://bushwickdaily.com/2013/11/the-left-hand-path-leads-to-performa-13/}}</ref>\n\n===Wave-Gotik-Treffen music festival===\n\nOn May 23, 2015, after a 24-year retreat from musical performances, Zeena made her official return to music in Europe, now as a solo artist, at the [[Wave-Gotik-Treffen]] festival in Leipzig, Germany.<ref>{{cite web|title=Heathen Harvest report: Zeena Schreck Performs a Typhonian Tantric Ritual Soundscape at the Egyptian Museum, Leipzig|url=https://heathenharvest.org/2015/04/18/zeena-schreck-performs-a-typhonian-tantric-ritual-soundscape-at-the-egyptian-museum-leipzig/}}</ref> The concert, held amid \"the sacred, magically charged ancient artifacts housed in Leipzig's Egyptian Museum (at the [[Leipzig University]]),\" was a unique ritual soundscape which Zeena composed especially for the theme of that environment.<ref>{{cite web|title=KPopStarz report: Legendary Magic Practitioner Zeena Schreck Returns To European Music Scene For First Time In 24 Years This Saturday, May 23|url=http://www.kpopstarz.com/articles/203000/20150519/zeena-schreck-new-music.htm}}</ref> She was accompanied by Cory Vielma and [[John Murphy (musician)|John Murphy]].

{"title_page": "Staining", "text_new": "{{other uses}}\n{{short description|Technique used to enhance contrast of specimens observed under a microscope}}\n[[Image:Stained_microscope_slide.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A stained [[histologic]] specimen, sandwiched between a glass [[microscope slide]].]]\n\n'''Staining''' is a technique used to enhance contrast in samples, generally at the [[Microscope|microscopic]] level. Stains and [[dye]]s are frequently used in [[histology]] (the study of tissue under the microscope) and in the [[medical]] fields of [[histopathology]], [[hematology]], and [[cytopathology]] that focus on the study and [[diagnoses]] [[disease]] at a microscopic level. Stains may be used to define [[biological tissues]] (highlighting, for example, [[muscle fiber]]s or [[connective tissue]]), [[cell (biology)|cell]] populations (classifying different [[blood cell]]s), or [[organelle]]s within individual cells.\n\nIn [[biochemistry]] it involves adding a class-specific ([[DNA]], [[protein]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s) dye to a substrate to qualify or quantify the presence of a specific compound. Staining and [[fluorescent tag]]ging can serve similar purposes. Biological staining is also used to mark cells in [[flow cytometry]], and to flag [[protein]]s or [[nucleic acid]]s in [[gel electrophoresis]].\n\nStaining is not limited to biological materials, it can also be used to study the structure of other materials for example the lamellar structures of semi-crystalline [[polymer]]s or the domain structures of [[block copolymer]]s.\n\n== ''In vivo'' vs ''In vitro'' ==\n''[[In vivo]] staining'' (also called [[vital staining]] or intravital staining) is the process of dyeing living tissues. By causing certain cells or structures to take on contrasting colour(s), their form ([[Morphology (biology)|morphology]]) or position within a cell or tissue can be readily seen and studied. The usual purpose is to reveal cytological details that might otherwise not be apparent; however, staining can also reveal where certain chemicals or specific chemical reactions are taking place within cells or tissues.\n\n''[[In vitro]]'' staining involves colouring cells or structures that have been removed from their biological context. Certain stains are often combined to reveal more details and features than a single stain alone.  Combined with specific protocols for [[fixation (histology)|fixation]] and sample preparation, scientists and physicians can use these standard techniques as consistent, repeatable diagnostic tools. A [[counterstain]] is stain that makes cells or structures more visible, when not completely visible with the principal stain.\n* For example, [[crystal violet]] stains only [[Gram-positive]] bacteria in [[Gram staining]]. A [[safranin]] counterstain is applied that stains all cells, allowing identification of Gram-negative bacteria.\n\nWhile ex vivo, many cells continue to live and metabolize until they are \"fixed\". Some staining methods are based on this property. Those stains excluded by the living cells but taken up by the  already dead cells are called [[vital stain]]s (e.g. [[trypan blue]] or [[propidium iodide]] for eukaryotic cells). Those that enter and stain living cells are called [[supravital stain]]s (e.g. [[New Methylene Blue]] and [[brilliant cresyl blue]] for [[reticulocyte]] staining). However, these stains are eventually toxic to the organism, some more so than others.  Partly due to their toxic interaction inside a living cell, when supravital stains enter a living cell, they might produce a characteristic pattern of staining different from the staining of an already fixed cell (e.g. \"reticulocyte\" look versus diffuse \"polychromasia\"). To achieve desired effects, the stains are used in very dilute solutions ranging from {{gaps|1|:|5|000}} to {{gaps|1|:|500|000}} (Howey, 2000). Note that many stains may be used in both living and fixed cells.\n\n== Microscopy in Staining ==\nA common microscope used in staining is the [[Bright-field microscopy|bright-field microscope]]. The bright-field microscope is categorized as a light microscope because of the illuminator which produces light to create a bright background. These microscopes are usually binocular, meaning that there are two eyepieces which are typically at ten times magnification. When viewing stained organisms at one thousand times magnification, oil is needed to help create a clearer view due to the distortion of resolution from [[Refraction|light refraction]] which becomes incredibly pronounced at high magnification.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book |last=Parker |first=Nina | name-list-format = vanc |title=Microbiology|publisher=OpenStax|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Preparation ==\nThe preparatory steps involved depend on the type of analysis planned; some or all of the following procedures may be required.\n\nWet Mounts- wet mounts are used to view live organisms and can be made using water and certain stains. The liquid is added to the slide before the addition of the organism and a coverslip is placed over the specimen in the water and stain to help contain it within the [[field of view]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n'''[[Fixation (histology)|Fixation]]'''\u2013which may itself consist of several steps\u2013aims to preserve the shape of the cells or tissue involved as much as possible.  Sometimes [[heat fixation]] is used to kill, adhere, and alter the specimen so it accepts stains. Most chemical fixatives (chemicals causing fixation) generate [[chemical bond]]s between [[protein]]s and other substances within the sample, increasing their rigidity.

This treatment dissolves [[cell membrane]]s, and allows larger dye molecules into the cell's interior.\n\n'''[[Microscope slide#Mounting|Mounting]]''' usually involves attaching the samples to a glass microscope slide for observation and analysis.  In some cases, cells may be grown directly on a slide.  For samples of loose cells (as with a blood smear or a [[pap smear]]) the sample can be directly applied to a slide.  For larger pieces of tissue, thin sections (slices) are made using a [[microtome]]; these slices can then be mounted and inspected.\n\n=== Standardization ===\n\nMost of the dyes commonly used in microscopy are available as '''BSC-certified stains'''. This means that samples of the manufacturer's batch have been tested by an independent body, the [[Biological Stain Commission]] ('''BSC'''), and found to meet or exceed certain standards of purity, dye content and performance in staining techniques ensuring more accurately performed experiments and more reliable results. These standards are published in the Commission's journal [[Biotechnic & Histochemistry]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Penney DP, Powers JM, Frank M, Willis C, Churukian C | title = Analysis and testing of biological stains--the Biological Stain Commission Procedures | journal = Biotechnic & Histochemistry | volume = 77 | issue = 5\u20136 | pages = 237\u201375 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12564600 | doi = 10.1080/714028210 }}</ref> Many dyes are inconsistent in composition from one supplier to another.

This can be achieved by smearing the sample onto the slide and then applying [[nigrosin]] (a black synthetic dye) or [[India ink]] (an aqueous suspension of carbon particles). After drying, the microorganisms may be viewed in bright field microscopy as lighter inclusions well-contrasted against the dark environment surrounding them.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Clark G | date = 1981 | title = Staining Procedures | edition = 4th | location = Baltimore | publisher = Williams & Wilkins | page = 412 | isbn = 978-0-683-01707-6 }}</ref>  Negative staining is able to stain the background instead of the organisms because the cell wall of microorganisms typically has a negative charge which repels the negatively charged stain. The dyes used in negative staining are acidic.<ref name=\":1\" /> Note: negative staining is a mild technique that may not destroy the microorganisms, and is therefore unsuitable for studying pathogens.\n\n=== Positive staining ===\nUnlike negative staining, positive staining uses basic dyes to color the specimen against a bright background. While [[chromophore]] is used for both negative and positive staining alike, the type of chromophore used in this technique is a positively charged ion instead of a negative one. The negatively charged cell wall of many microorganisms attracts the positively charged chromophore which causes the specimen to absorb the stain giving it the color of the stain being used. Positive staining is more commonly used than negative staining in microbiology. The different types of positive staining are listed below.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Simple Staining versus Differential Staining ===\nSimple Staining is a technique that only uses one type of stain on a slide at a time. Because only one stain is being used, the specimens (for positive stains) or background (for negative stains) will be one color. Therefore, simple stains are typically used for viewing only one organism per slide. Differential staining uses multiple stains per slide. Based on the stains being used, organisms with different properties will appear different colors allowing for categorization of multiple specimens. Differential staining can also be used to color different organelles within one organism which can be seen in [[endospore staining]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Types of Staining Techniques<ref>{{Cite book|title=Elementary Microbiology Vol - I|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Sr. No.\n!Staining Technique\n!Preparation\n!Application\n!Result\n|-\n|1.\n|Simple (Monochrome)\n|Smear stain with single dye .\neg.

Gram staining uses [[Gentian violet|crystal violet]] to stain cell walls, [[iodine]] (as a mordant), and a [[fuchsin]] or [[safranin]] counterstain to (mark all bacteria). Gram status, proven to be relevant in the field of medicine, determines the presence or absence of a cell wall changes the bacterium's susceptibility to some [[antibiotic]]s.\n\n[[Gram-positive]] bacteria stain dark blue or violet. Their [[cell wall]] is typically <!-- but not always !! --> rich with [[peptidoglycan]] and lacks the secondary membrane and [[lipopolysaccharide]] layer found in Gram-negative bacteria.\n\nOn most Gram-stained preparations, [[Gram-negative]] organisms appear red or pink due to their counterstain. Due to the presence of higher lipid content, after alcohol-treatment, the porosity of the cell wall increases, hence the CVI complex (crystal violet \u2013 iodine) can pass through. Thus, the primary stain is not retained. In addition, in contrast to most Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria have only a few layers of peptidoglycan and a secondary cell membrane made primarily of lipopolysaccharide.\n\n=== Endospore staining ===\n{{main|Endospore staining}}\n[[Endospore staining]] is used to identify the presence or absence of [[endospore]]s, which make bacteria very difficult to kill.  Bacterial spores have proven to be difficult to stain as they are not permeable to aqueous dye reagents.\u00a0 Endospore staining is particularly useful for identifying endospore-forming bacterial [[pathogen]]s such as ''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|Clostridium difficile]]''. Prior to the development of more efficient methods, this stain was performed using the Wirtz method with heat fixation and counterstain. Through the use of malachite green and a diluted ratio of carbol fuchsin, fixing bacteria in osmic acid was a great way to ensure no blending of dyes. However, newly revised staining methods have significantly decreased the time it takes to create these stains. This revision included substitution of carbol fuchsin with aqueous Safranin paired with a newly diluted 5% formula of malachite green. This new and improved composition of stains was performed in the same way as before with the use of heat fixation, rinsing, and blotting dry for later examination. Upon examination, all endospore forming bacteria will be stained green accompanied by all other cells appearing red. <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schaeffer AB, Fulton MD | title = A Simplified Method of Staining Endospores | journal = Science | volume = 77 | issue = 1990 | pages = 194 | date = February 1933 | pmid = 17741261 | doi = 10.1126/science.77.1990.194 | bibcode = 1933Sci....77..194S }}</ref>\n\n=== Ziehl-Neelsen stain ===\n{{main|Ziehl-Neelsen stain}}\n[[Ziehl-Neelsen stain]]ing is used to stain species of ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' that do not stain with the standard laboratory staining procedures such as Gram staining.\n\nThis stain is performed through the use of both red coloured [[Carbol fuchsin]] that stains the bacteria and a counter stain such as [[Methylene blue]]\n\n=== Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining ===\n{{main|H&E stain}}\n[[Image:Emphysema H and E.jpg|right|thumb|Microscopic view of a histologic specimen of human [[lung]] tissue stained with [[hematoxylin]] and [[eosin]].]]\n[[H&E stain|Haematoxylin and eosin stain]]ing is frequently used in [[histology]] to examine thin tissue sections.<ref name=\"Bancroft and Stevens, 1982\">{{cite book|title=The Theory and Practice of Histological Techniques|date=1982|publisher=Longman Group Limited |editor1-last=Bancroft |editor2-last=Stevens|editor2-first=Alan | name-list-format = vanc |editor1-first=John|edition=2nd}}</ref>  [[Haematoxylin]] stains cell nuclei blue, while [[eosin]] stains cytoplasm, connective tissue and other extracellular substances pink or red.<ref name=\"Bancroft and Stevens, 1982\" />  Eosin is strongly absorbed by [[red blood cell]]s, colouring them bright red. In a skillfully made H&E preparation the red blood cells are almost orange, and collagen and cytoplasm (especially muscle) acquire different shades of pink.\n\n=== Papanicolaou staining ===\n{{main|Papanicolaou stain}}\n[[Papanicolaou stain]]ing, or PAP staining, was developed to replace fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in hopes of decreasing staining times and cost without compromising quality. This stain is a frequently used method for examining cell samples from a variety of tissue types in various organs. PAP staining has endured several modifications in order to become a \u201csuitable alternative\u201d for FNAC. This transition stemmed from the appreciation of wet fixed smears by scientists preserving the structures of the nuclei opposed to the opaque appearance of air dried Romanowsky smears. This led to the creation of a hybrid stain of wet fixed and air dried known as the ultrafast papanicolaou stain. This modification includes the use of nasal saline to rehydrate cells to increase cell transparency and is paired with the use of alcoholic formalin to enhance colors of the nuclei. The papanicolaou stain is now used in place of cytological staining in all organ types due to its increase in morphological quality, decreased staining time, and decreased cost. It is frequently used to stain [[Pap smear]] specimens.<ref name=\"Gill, 2013\">{{cite book|last1=Gill|first1=Gary W. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Cytopreparation|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4614-4932-4|series=Essentials in Cytopathology|volume=12|pages=143\u2013189|chapter=Papanicolaou Stain|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-4933-1_10|issn=1574-9053}}</ref> It uses a combination of [[haematoxylin]], [[Orange G]], [[eosin Y]], [[Light Green SF yellowish]], and sometimes [[Bismarck Brown Y]].<ref name=\"Bancroft and Stevens, 1982\" /><ref name=\"Gill, 2013\" /> <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Thakur M, Guttikonda VR | title = Modified ultrafast Papanicolaou staining technique: A comparative study | journal = Journal of Cytology | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 149\u2013153 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28701828 | pmc = 5492752 | doi = 10.4103/JOC.JOC_23_16 }}</ref>\n\n=== PAS staining ===\n{{main|Periodic acid\u2013Schiff stain}}\n[[Image:Histoplasma pas-d small.jpg|thumb|right|[[PAS diastase]] showing the fungus [[Histoplasma]].]]\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://labce.com/spg949466_periodic_acid_schiff_pas_diagnostic_applications.aspx|title=Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS): Diagnostic Applications - LabCE.com, Laboratory Continuing Education|website=labce.com|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>[[Periodic acid-Schiff]] is a histology special stain used to mark [[carbohydrate]]s ([[glycogen]], [[glycoprotein]], [[proteoglycan]]s). PAS is commonly used on liver tissue where glycogen deposits are made which is done in efforts to distinguish different types of glycogen storage diseases. PAS is important because it can detect glycogen granules found in tumors of the ovaries and pancreas of the endocrine system, as well as in the bladder and kidneys of the renal system. Basement membranes can also show up in a PAS stain and can be important when diagnosing renal disease. Due to the high volume of carbohydrates within the cell wall of hyphae and yeast forms of fungi, the Periodic acid -Schiff stain can help locate these species inside tissue samples of the human body.\n\n=== Masson's trichrome ===\n{{main|Masson's trichrome stain}}\n[[Masson's trichrome]] is (as the name implies) a three-colour staining protocol.  The recipe has evolved from Masson's original technique for different specific applications, but all are well-suited to distinguish cells from surrounding [[connective tissue]].  Most recipes produce red [[keratin]] and muscle fibers, blue or green staining of [[collagen]] and [[bone]], light red or pink staining of [[cytoplasm]], and black [[cell nucleus|cell nuclei]].\n\n=== Romanowsky stains ===\n{{main|Romanowsky stain}}\nThe [[Romanowsky stain]]s is considered a polychrome staining effect and is based on a combination of eosin plus (chemically [[reduction (chemistry)|reduced]] [[eosin]]) and demethylated [[methylene blue]] (containing its oxidation products [[azure A]] and [[azure B]]).  This stain develops varying colors for all cell structures (\u201cRomanowsky-Giemsa effect) and thus was used in staining neutrophil polymorphs and cell nuclei. Common variants include [[Wright's stain]], [[Jenner's stain]], May-Grunwald stain, [[Leishman stain]] and [[Giemsa stain]].\n\nAll are used to examine [[blood]] or [[bone marrow]] samples.  They are preferred over H&E for inspection of blood cells because different types of [[white blood cells|leukocytes]] (white blood cells) can be readily distinguished.  All are also suited to examination of blood to detect blood-borne parasites such as [[malaria]].<ref name = \"Bezrukov_2017\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bezrukov AV | title = Romanowsky staining, the Romanowsky effect and thoughts on the question of scientific priority | journal = Biotechnic & Histochemistry | volume = 92 | issue = 1 | pages = 29\u201335 | date = 2017-01-02 | pmid = 28098484 | doi = 10.1080/10520295.2016.1250285 }}</ref>\n\n=== Silver staining ===\n[[Image:Histoplasma in granuloma gms.jpg|thumb|right|[[G\u00f6m\u00f6ri methenamine silver stain]] demonstrating [[histoplasma]] (illustrated in black).]]\n[[Silver stain]]ing is the use of [[silver]] to stain [[histologic section]]s. This kind of staining is important in the demonstration of [[protein]]s (for example type III [[collagen]]) and [[DNA]]. It is used to show both substances inside and outside [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. Silver staining is also used in [[temperature gradient gel electrophoresis]].\n\n''Argentaffin cells'' [[Redox|reduce]] silver solution to metallic silver after [[formalin]] [[fixation (histology)|fixation]]. This method was discovered by Italian [[Camillo Golgi]], by using a reaction between [[silver nitrate]] and [[potassium dichromate]], thus precipitating silver chromate in some cells (see [[Golgi's method]]). A''rgyrophilic cells'' reduce silver solution to metallic silver after being exposed to the stain that contains a [[Reducing agent|reductant]]. An example of this would be [[hydroquinone]] or formalin.\n\n=== Sudan staining ===\n{{main|Sudan stain}}\n[[Sudan stain]]ing utilizes Sudan dyes to stain sudanophilic substances, often including [[lipid]]s. [[Sudan III]], [[Sudan IV]], [[Oil Red O]], [[Osmium tetroxide]], and [[Sudan Black B]] are often used. Sudan staining is often used to determine the level of [[fecal fat]] in diagnosing [[steatorrhea]].\n\n=== Wirtz-Conklin staining ===\nThe Wirtz-Conklin stain is a special technique designed for staining true endospores with the use of malachite green dye as the primary stain and safranin as the counterstain. Once stained, they do not decolourize. The addition of heat during the staining process is a huge contributing factor.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Corey L | title = Laboratory diagnosis of herpes simplex virus infections.

The main purpose of this stain is to show germination of bacterial spores. If the process of germination is taking place, then the spore will turn green in color due to malachite green and the surrounding cell will be red from the safranin. This stain can also help determine the orientation of the spore within the bacterial cell; whether it being terminal (at the tip), subterminal (within the cell), or central (completely in the middle of the cell).\n\n===Collagen Hybridizing Peptide Staining===\n{{main|Collagen Hybridizing Peptide}}\n[[Collagen Hybridizing Peptide]] (CHP) staining allows for an easy, direct way to stain denatured collagens of any type (Type I, II, IV, etc.) regardless if they were damaged or degraded via enzymatic, mechanical, chemical, or thermal means. They work by refolding into the collagen triple helix with the available single strands in the tissue. CHPs can be visualized by a simple [[fluorescence microscope]].\n\n== Common biological stains ==\nDifferent stains react or concentrate in different parts of a cell or tissue, and these properties are used to advantage to reveal specific parts or areas.  Some of the most common biological stains are listed below.  Unless otherwise marked, all of these dyes may be used with fixed cells and tissues; vital dyes (suitable for use with living organisms) are noted.\n\n=== Acridine orange ===\n[[Acridine orange]] (AO) is a nucleic acid selective fluorescent cationic dye useful for cell cycle determination. It is cell-permeable, and interacts with DNA and RNA by intercalation or electrostatic attractions. When bound to DNA, it is very similar spectrally to fluorescein. Like fluorescein, it is also useful as a non-specific stain for backlighting conventionally stained cells on the surface of a solid sample of tissue (fluorescence backlighted staining<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wells J | year = 1988 | title = A Technique for Staining the Superficial Cells of Plucked Hair Follicles and Other Solid Tissues | url = | journal = Stain Technology | volume = 63 | issue = 3 }}</ref>).\n\n=== Bismarck brown ===\n<ref>{{Cite journal| vauthors = Tomov N, Dimitrov N |date=2017|title=Modified bismarck brown staining for demonstration of soft tissue mast cells |url= http://tru.uni-sz.bg/tsj/Vol15_N3_2017/2_N.Tomov.pdf|journal=Trakia Journal of Science |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=195\u2013197 |doi=10.15547/tjs.2017.03.001 }}</ref>[[Bismarck brown Y|Bismarck brown]] (also Bismarck brown Y or Manchester brown) imparts a yellow colour to acid [[mucin]]s. and an intense brown color to mast cells. One default of this stain is that it blots out any other structure surrounding it and makes the quality of the contrast low. It has to be paired with other stains\u00a0 in order to be useful. Some complimenting stains used alongside Bismark brown are Hematoxylin and Toluidine blue which provide better contrast within the histology sample.\n\n=== Carmine ===\n[[Image:Pseudorhabdosynochus morrhua.jpg|thumb|[[Carmine]] staining of a parasitic flatworm.]]\n[[Carmine]] is an intensely red dye used to stain [[glycogen]], while Carmine alum is a nuclear stain.  Carmine stains require the use of a mordant, usually [[aluminum]].\n\n=== Coomassie blue ===\n[[Coomassie Brilliant Blue|Coomassie blue]] (also brilliant blue) nonspecifically stains proteins a strong blue colour.  It is often used in gel electrophoresis.\n\n===Cresyl violet===\n\n[[Cresyl violet stain|Cresyl violet]] stains the acidic components of the neuronal cytoplasm a violet colour, specifically [[Nissl body|nissl]] bodies. Often used in brain research.\n\n=== Crystal violet ===\n[[Crystal violet]], when combined with a suitable mordant, stains [[cell wall]]s purple.  Crystal violet is the stain used in Gram staining.\n\n=== DAPI ===\n[[DAPI]] is a [[fluorescent]] nuclear stain, excited by [[ultraviolet]] light and showing strong blue fluorescence when bound to [[DNA]].  DAPI binds with A=T rich repeats of chromosomes. DAPI is also not visible with regular transmission microscopy. It may be used in living or fixed cells. DAPI-stained cells are especially appropriate for cell counting.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Levenfus I | title = An efficient method for counting DAPI-stained cells using Fiji | publisher = Grin | location = Munich | date = 2011 | isbn = 978-3-640-86284-9 }}</ref>\n\n=== Eosin ===\n[[Eosin]] is most often used as a counterstain to haematoxylin, imparting a pink or red colour to [[cytoplasm]]ic material, [[cell membrane]]s, and some extracellular structures.  It also imparts a strong red colour to [[red blood cell]]s.  Eosin may also be used as a counterstain in some variants of Gram staining, and in many other protocols.  There are actually two very closely related compounds commonly referred to as eosin.  Most often used is [[eosin Y]] (also known as eosin Y ws or eosin yellowish); it has a very slightly yellowish cast.  The other eosin compound is eosin B (eosin bluish or imperial red); it has a very faint bluish cast.  The two dyes are interchangeable, and the use of one or the other is more a matter of preference and tradition.\n\n=== Ethidium bromide ===\n[[Ethidium bromide]] [[intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalates]] and stains DNA, providing a fluorescent red-orange stain. Although it will not stain healthy cells, it can be used to identify cells that are in the final stages of [[apoptosis]] \u2013 such cells have much more permeable [[biological membrane|membranes]]. Consequently, ethidium bromide is often used as a marker for apoptosis in cells populations and to locate bands of DNA in [[gel electrophoresis]]. The stain may also be used in conjunction with [[acridine orange]] (AO) in viable cell counting. This EB/AO combined stain causes live cells to fluoresce green whilst apoptotic cells retain the distinctive red-orange fluorescence.\n\n=== Acid fuchsin ===\n[[Fuchsine|Acid fuchsine]] may be used to stain collagen, smooth muscle, or [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]].\nAcid fuchsin is used as the nuclear and cytoplasmic stain in Mallory's trichrome method. Acid fuchsin stains cytoplasm in some variants of Masson's trichrome.  In Van Gieson's picro-fuchsine, acid fuchsin imparts its red colour to collagen fibres. Acid fuchsin is also a traditional stain for mitochondria (Altmann's method).\n\n=== Haematoxylin ===\n[[Haematoxylin]] (hematoxylin in North America) is a nuclear stain.<ref name=\"Bancroft and Stevens, 1982\" />  Used with a mordant, haematoxylin stains nuclei blue-violet or brown.<ref name=\"Bancroft and Stevens, 1982\" />  It is most often used with eosin in the [[H&E stain]] (haematoxylin and eosin) staining, one of the most common procedures in [[histology]].<ref name=\"Bancroft and Stevens, 1982\" />\n\n=== Hoechst stains ===\n[[Hoechst stain|Hoechst]] is a ''bis''-benzimidazole derivative compound that binds to the ''minor groove'' of [[DNA]]. Often used in fluorescence microscopy for DNA staining, Hoechst stains appear yellow when dissolved in aqueous solutions and emit blue light under UV excitation. There are two major types of [[Hoechst stain|Hoechst]]: ''Hoechst 33258'' and ''Hoechst 33342''. The two compounds are functionally similar, but with a little difference in structure. Hoechst 33258 contains a terminal [[hydroxyl]] group and is thus more soluble in aqueous solution, however this characteristics reduces its ability to penetrate the [[plasma membrane]]. Hoechst 33342 contains an [[ethyl group|ethyl]] substitution on the terminal hydroxyl group (i.e. an ethylether group) making it more hydrophobic for easier plasma membrane passage\n\n=== Iodine ===\n[[Iodine]] is used in [[chemistry]] as an indicator for [[starch]]. When starch is mixed with iodine in solution, an intensely dark blue colour develops, representing a starch/iodine complex. Starch is a substance common to most plant cells and so a weak iodine solution will stain starch present in the cells. Iodine is one component in the staining technique known as [[Gram staining]], used in [[microbiology]]. Used as a [[mordant]] in Gram's staining, iodine enhances the entrance of the dye through the pores present in the cell wall/membrane.\n\n[[Lugol's iodine|Lugol's solution]] or Lugol's iodine (IKI) is a brown solution that turns black in the presence of starches and can be used as a cell stain, making the cell [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] more visible.\n\nUsed with common vinegar (acetic acid), Lugol's solution is used to identify [[Cervical cancer#Diagnosis|pre-cancerous and cancerous changes]] in cervical and vaginal tissues during \"Pap smear\" follow up examinations in preparation for biopsy. The acetic acid causes the abnormal cells to blanch white, while the normal tissues stain a mahogany brown from the iodine.<ref>{{cite book | chapter = Chapter 4: An introduction to colposcopy: indications for colposcopy, instrumentation, principles and documentation of results | title = Colposcopy and treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: a beginners' manual | veditors = Sellors JW, Sankaranarayanan R | url =  http://screening.iarc.fr/colpochap.php?lang=1&chap=4 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190131040048/http://screening.iarc.fr/colpochap.php?lang=1&chap=4 | archive-date = 31 January 2019 | publisher = The World Health Organization }}</ref>\n\n=== Malachite green ===\n[[Malachite green]] (also known as diamond green B or victoria green B) can be used as a blue-green counterstain to safranin in the [[Gimenez stain|Gimenez staining technique]] for bacteria.

Also used to stain  blood films in cytology.\n\n=== Neutral red ===\n[[Neutral red]] (or toluylene red) stains [[Nissl body|Nissl substance]] red.  It is usually used as a counterstain in combination with other dyes.\n\n=== Nile blue ===\n[[Nile blue]] (or Nile blue A) stains nuclei blue.  It may be used with living cells.\n\n=== Nile red ===\n[[Nile red]] (also known as Nile blue oxazone) is formed by boiling Nile blue with [[sulfuric acid]].  This produces a mix of Nile red and Nile blue.  Nile red is a [[lipophilic]] stain; it will accumulate in [[lipid]] globules inside cells, staining them red.  Nile red can be used with living cells. It fluoresces strongly when partitioned into lipids, but practically not at all in aqueous solution.\n\n=== Osmium tetroxide (formal name: osmium tetraoxide) ===\n[[Osmium tetraoxide]] is used in optical microscopy to stain [[lipid]]s. It dissolves in fats, and is reduced by organic materials to elemental osmium, an easily visible black substance.\n\n=== Propidium Iodide ===\n[[Propidium iodide]] is a fluorescent intercalating agent that can be used to stain cells. Propidium iodide is used as a DNA stain in flow cytometry to evaluate cell viability or DNA content in cell cycle analysis, or in microscopy to visualise the nucleus and other DNA-containing organelles. Propidium Iodide cannot cross the membrane of live cells, making it useful to differentiate necrotic, apoptotic and healthy cells. PI also binds to RNA, necessitating treatment with nucleases to distinguish between RNA and DNA staining\n\n=== Rhodamine ===\n[[Rhodamine]] is a protein specific fluorescent stain commonly used in fluorescence microscopy.\n\n=== Safranine ===\n[[Safranine]] (or Safranine O) is a red cationic dye.  It binds to nuclei (DNA) and other tissue polyanions, including glycosaminoglycans in cartilage and mast cells, and components of lignin and plastids in plant tissues.<ref>Berlyn GP, Miksche JP (1976).

[[Chromosomes]] were so named because of their ability to absorb a violet stain.\n\nPositive affinity for a specific stain may be designated by the suffix ''-philic''. For example, tissues that stain with an [[azure stain]] may be referred to as [[azurophil]]ic. This may also be used for more generalized staining properties, such as [[Acidophile (histology)|acidophilic]] for tissues that stain by [[acidic]] stains (most notably [[eosin]]), [[basophilic]] when staining in [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] dyes, and ''amphophilic''<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/amphophilic thefreedictionary.com > amphophilic] Citing: ''Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary'', 3 ed. 2007 Elsevier, Inc</ref> when staining with either acid or basic dyes. In contrast, [[chromophobe|chromophobic]] tissues do not take up coloured dye readily.\n\n== Electron microscopy ==\nAs in light microscopy, stains can be used to enhance contrast in [[transmission electron microscopy]]. Electron-dense compounds of heavy metals are typically used.\n\n===Phosphotungstic acid===\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmrf.research.uiowa.edu/negative-staining|title=Negative Staining {{!}} Central Microscopy Research Facility|website=cmrf.research.uiowa.edu|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>[[Phosphotungstic acid]] is a common [[negative stain]] for [[virus]]es, [[nerve]]s, [[polysaccharide]]s, and other biological tissue materials. It is mostly used in a .5-2% ph form making it neutral and is paired with water to make an aqueous solution. Phosphotungstic acid is filled with electron dense matter that stains the background surrounding the specimen dark and the specimen itself light. This process is not the normal positive technique for staining where the specimen is dark and the background remains light.\n\n=== Osmium tetroxide ===\n[[Osmium tetroxide]] is used in optical microscopy to stain [[lipid]]s. It dissolves in fats, and is reduced by organic materials to elemental osmium, an easily visible black substance.  Because it is a heavy metal that absorbs electrons, it is perhaps the most common stain used for morphology in biological electron microscopy. It is also used for the staining of various polymers for the study of their morphology by TEM. {{chem|OsO|4}} is very volatile and extremely toxic. It is a strong oxidizing agent as the osmium has an oxidation number of +8. It aggressively oxidizes many materials, leaving behind a deposit of non-volatile osmium in a lower oxidation state.\n\n=== Ruthenium tetroxide ===\n[[Ruthenium tetroxide]] is equally volatile and even more aggressive than osmium tetraoxide and able to stain even materials that resist the osmium stain, e.g. polyethylene.\n\nOther chemicals used in electron microscopy staining include:\n[[ammonium molybdate]], [[cadmium iodide]], [[carbohydrazide]], [[ferric chloride]], [[hexamine]], [[indium trichloride]], [[lanthanum nitrate]], [[lead acetate]], [[lead citrate]], [[lead(II) nitrate]], [[periodic acid]], [[phosphomolybdic acid]], [[potassium ferricyanide]], [[potassium ferrocyanide]], [[ruthenium red]], [[silver nitrate]], [[silver proteinate]], [[sodium chloroaurate]], [[thallium nitrate]], [[thiosemicarbazide]], [[uranyl acetate]], [[uranyl nitrate]], and [[vanadyl sulfate]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Cell biology|Cytology]]: the study of cells\n* [[Histology]]: the study of tissues\n* [[Immunohistochemistry]]: the use of antisera to label specific antigens\n* [[Ruthenium(II) tris(bathophenanthroline disulfonate)]], a protein dye.\n* [[Vital stain]]: stains that do not kill cells\n* [[Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis|PAGE]]: separation of protein molecules\n*[[Barium enema]] - a type of in vivo stain that creates contrast in the x-ray part of the light spectrum\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | veditors = Bancroft JD, Gamble M | date = 2002 | title = Theory and Practice of Histological Techniques | edition = 5th | location = London | publisher = Churchill-Livingstone | isbn = 978-0-443-06435-7 }}\n* {{cite book | vauthors = Kiernan JA | date = 2015 | title = Histological and Histochemical Methods.

Stains and [[dye]]s are frequently used in [[histology]] (the study of tissue under the microscope) and in the [[medical]] fields of [[histopathology]], [[hematology]], and [[cytopathology]] that focus on the study and [[diagnoses]] [[disease]] at a microscopic level. Stains may be used to define [[biological tissues]] (highlighting, for example, [[muscle fiber]]s or [[connective tissue]]), [[cell (biology)|cell]] populations (classifying different [[blood cell]]s), or [[organelle]]s within individual cells.\n\nIn [[biochemistry]] it involves adding a class-specific ([[DNA]], [[protein]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s) dye to a substrate to qualify or quantify the presence of a specific compound. Staining and [[fluorescent tag]]ging can serve similar purposes. Biological staining is also used to mark cells in [[flow cytometry]], and to flag [[protein]]s or [[nucleic acid]]s in [[gel electrophoresis]].\n\nStaining is not limited to biological materials, it can also be used to study the structure of other materials for example the lamellar structures of semi-crystalline [[polymer]]s or the domain structures of [[block copolymer]]s.\n\n== ''In vivo'' vs ''In vitro'' ==\n''[[In vivo]] staining'' (also called [[vital staining]] or intravital staining) is the process of dyeing living tissues. By causing certain cells or structures to take on contrasting colour(s), their form ([[Morphology (biology)|morphology]]) or position within a cell or tissue can be readily seen and studied. The usual purpose is to reveal cytological details that might otherwise not be apparent; however, staining can also reveal where certain chemicals or specific chemical reactions are taking place within cells or tissues.\n\n''[[In vitro]]'' staining involves colouring cells or structures that have been removed from their biological context. Certain stains are often combined to reveal more details and features than a single stain alone.  Combined with specific protocols for [[fixation (histology)|fixation]] and sample preparation, scientists and physicians can use these standard techniques as consistent, repeatable diagnostic tools. A [[counterstain]] is stain that makes cells or structures more visible, when not completely visible with the principal stain.\n* For example, [[crystal violet]] stains only [[Gram-positive]] bacteria in [[Gram staining]]. A [[safranin]] counterstain is applied that stains all cells, allowing identification of Gram-negative bacteria.\n\nWhile ex vivo, many cells continue to live and metabolize until they are \"fixed\". Some staining methods are based on this property. Those stains excluded by the living cells but taken up by the  already dead cells are called [[vital stain]]s (e.g. [[trypan blue]] or [[propidium iodide]] for eukaryotic cells). Those that enter and stain living cells are called [[supravital stain]]s (e.g. [[New Methylene Blue]] and [[brilliant cresyl blue]] for [[reticulocyte]] staining). However, these stains are eventually toxic to the organism, some more so than others.  Partly due to their toxic interaction inside a living cell, when supravital stains enter a living cell, they might produce a characteristic pattern of staining different from the staining of an already fixed cell (e.g. \"reticulocyte\" look versus diffuse \"polychromasia\"). To achieve desired effects, the stains are used in very dilute solutions ranging from {{gaps|1|:|5|000}} to {{gaps|1|:|500|000}} (Howey, 2000). Note that many stains may be used in both living and fixed cells.\n\n== Microscopy in Staining ==\nA common microscope used in staining is the [[Bright-field microscopy|bright-field microscope]]. The bright-field microscope is categorized as a light microscope because of the illuminator which produces light to create a bright background. These microscopes are usually binocular, meaning that there are two eyepieces which are typically at ten times magnification. When viewing stained organisms at one thousand times magnification, oil is needed to help create a clearer view due to the distortion of resolution from [[Refraction|light refraction]] which becomes incredibly pronounced at high magnification.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book |last=Parker |first=Nina | name-list-format = vanc |title=Microbiology|publisher=OpenStax|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Preparation ==\nThe preparatory steps involved depend on the type of analysis planned; some or all of the following procedures may be required.\n\nWet Mounts- wet mounts are used to view live organisms and can be made using water and certain stains. The liquid is added to the slide before the addition of the organism and a coverslip is placed over the specimen in the water and stain to help contain it within the [[field of view]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n'''[[Fixation (histology)|Fixation]]'''\u2013which may itself consist of several steps\u2013aims to preserve the shape of the cells or tissue involved as much as possible.  Sometimes [[heat fixation]] is used to kill, adhere, and alter the specimen so it accepts stains. Most chemical fixatives (chemicals causing fixation) generate [[chemical bond]]s between [[protein]]s and other substances within the sample, increasing their rigidity.  Common fixatives  include [[formaldehyde]], [[ethanol]], [[methanol]], and/or [[picric acid]].  Pieces of tissue may be embedded in [[paraffin wax]] to increase their mechanical strength and stability and to make them easier to cut into thin slices.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book | vauthors = Pommerville JC |title= Fundamentals of Microbiology | volume = I |publisher= Jones & Bartlett Learning |year= 2017 |location=|pages=248, 249|isbn = 978-1-284-10095-2 }}</ref>'''Mordant:''' These are chemical agents which have power of making dyes to stain materials which otherwise are unstainable\n\nMordants are classified into two categories:\n\na) Basic Mordant: React with acidic dyes e.g. alum , ferrous sulfate , cetylpyridinium chloride etc .\n\nb) Acidic Mordant : React with basic dyes e.g. picric acid , tannic acid etc.\n\n<ref name=\":0\" />'''Direct Staining:'''  Carried out without mordant.\n\n'''Indirect Staining:''' Staining brought by the aid of a mordant.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Table represents Indirect Staining Techniques and mordants applied in each:\n!Sr No.\n!Name of Indirect Staining Technique\n!Name of mordant applied\n|-\n|1.)\n|Gram's Staining\n|Gram's iodine\n|-\n|2.)\n|Cell Wall Staining\na.)

This treatment dissolves [[cell membrane]]s, and allows larger dye molecules into the cell's interior.\n\n'''[[Microscope slide#Mounting|Mounting]]''' usually involves attaching the samples to a glass microscope slide for observation and analysis.  In some cases, cells may be grown directly on a slide.  For samples of loose cells (as with a blood smear or a [[pap smear]]) the sample can be directly applied to a slide.  For larger pieces of tissue, thin sections (slices) are made using a [[microtome]]; these slices can then be mounted and inspected.\n\n=== Standardization ===\n\nMost of the dyes commonly used in microscopy are available as '''BSC-certified stains'''. This means that samples of the manufacturer's batch have been tested by an independent body, the [[Biological Stain Commission]] ('''BSC'''), and found to meet or exceed certain standards of purity, dye content and performance in staining techniques ensuring more accurately performed experiments and more reliable results. These standards are published in the Commission's journal [[Biotechnic & Histochemistry]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Penney DP, Powers JM, Frank M, Willis C, Churukian C | title = Analysis and testing of biological stains--the Biological Stain Commission Procedures | journal = Biotechnic & Histochemistry | volume = 77 | issue = 5\u20136 | pages = 237\u201375 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12564600 | doi = 10.1080/714028210 }}</ref> Many dyes are inconsistent in composition from one supplier to another.

This can be achieved by smearing the sample onto the slide and then applying [[nigrosin]] (a black synthetic dye) or [[India ink]] (an aqueous suspension of carbon particles). After drying, the microorganisms may be viewed in bright field microscopy as lighter inclusions well-contrasted against the dark environment surrounding them.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Clark G | date = 1981 | title = Staining Procedures | edition = 4th | location = Baltimore | publisher = Williams & Wilkins | page = 412 | isbn = 978-0-683-01707-6 }}</ref>  Negative staining is able to stain the background instead of the organisms because the cell wall of microorganisms typically has a negative charge which repels the negatively charged stain. The dyes used in negative staining are acidic.<ref name=\":1\" /> Note: negative staining is a mild technique that may not destroy the microorganisms, and is therefore unsuitable for studying pathogens.\n\n=== Positive staining ===\nUnlike negative staining, positive staining uses basic dyes to color the specimen against a bright background. While [[chromophore]] is used for both negative and positive staining alike, the type of chromophore used in this technique is a positively charged ion instead of a negative one. The negatively charged cell wall of many microorganisms attracts the positively charged chromophore which causes the specimen to absorb the stain giving it the color of the stain being used. Positive staining is more commonly used than negative staining in microbiology. The different types of positive staining are listed below.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Simple Staining versus Differential Staining ===\nSimple Staining is a technique that only uses one type of stain on a slide at a time. Because only one stain is being used, the specimens (for positive stains) or background (for negative stains) will be one color. Therefore, simple stains are typically used for viewing only one organism per slide. Differential staining uses multiple stains per slide. Based on the stains being used, organisms with different properties will appear different colors allowing for categorization of multiple specimens. Differential staining can also be used to color different organelles within one organism which can be seen in [[endospore staining]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Types of Staining Techniques<ref>{{Cite book|title=Elementary Microbiology Vol - I|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Sr. No.\n!Staining Technique\n!Preparation\n!Application\n!Result\n|-\n|1.\n|Simple (Monochrome)\n|Smear stain with single dye .\neg.

Gram staining uses [[Gentian violet|crystal violet]] to stain cell walls, [[iodine]] (as a mordant), and a [[fuchsin]] or [[safranin]] counterstain to (mark all bacteria). Gram status, proven to be relevant in the field of medicine, determines the presence or absence of a cell wall changes the bacterium's susceptibility to some [[antibiotic]]s.\n\n[[Gram-positive]] bacteria stain dark blue or violet. Their [[cell wall]] is typically <!-- but not always !! --> rich with [[peptidoglycan]] and lacks the secondary membrane and [[lipopolysaccharide]] layer found in Gram-negative bacteria.\n\nOn most Gram-stained preparations, [[Gram-negative]] organisms appear red or pink due to their counterstain. Due to the presence of higher lipid content, after alcohol-treatment, the porosity of the cell wall increases, hence the CVI complex (crystal violet \u2013 iodine) can pass through. Thus, the primary stain is not retained. In addition, in contrast to most Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria have only a few layers of peptidoglycan and a secondary cell membrane made primarily of lipopolysaccharide.\n\n=== Endospore staining ===\n{{main|Endospore staining}}\n[[Endospore staining]] is used to identify the presence or absence of [[endospore]]s, which make bacteria very difficult to kill.  Bacterial spores have proven to be difficult to stain as they are not permeable to aqueous dye reagents.\u00a0 Endospore staining is particularly useful for identifying endospore-forming bacterial [[pathogen]]s such as ''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|Clostridium difficile]]''. Prior to the development of more efficient methods, this stain was performed using the Wirtz method with heat fixation and counterstain. Through the use of malachite green and a diluted ratio of carbol fuchsin, fixing bacteria in osmic acid was a great way to ensure no blending of dyes. However, newly revised staining methods have significantly decreased the time it takes to create these stains. This revision included substitution of carbol fuchsin with aqueous Safranin paired with a newly diluted 5% formula of malachite green. This new and improved composition of stains was performed in the same way as before with the use of heat fixation, rinsing, and blotting dry for later examination. Upon examination, all endospore forming bacteria will be stained green accompanied by all other cells appearing red. <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schaeffer AB, Fulton MD | title = A Simplified Method of Staining Endospores | journal = Science | volume = 77 | issue = 1990 | pages = 194 | date = February 1933 | pmid = 17741261 | doi = 10.1126/science.77.1990.194 | bibcode = 1933Sci....77..194S }}</ref>\n\n=== Ziehl-Neelsen stain ===\n{{main|Ziehl-Neelsen stain}}\n[[Ziehl-Neelsen stain]]ing is used to stain species of ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' that do not stain with the standard laboratory staining procedures such as Gram staining.\n\nThis stain is performed through the use of both red coloured [[Carbol fuchsin]] that stains the bacteria and a counter stain such as [[Methylene blue]]\n\n=== Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining ===\n{{main|H&E stain}}\n[[Image:Emphysema H and E.jpg|right|thumb|Microscopic view of a histologic specimen of human [[lung]] tissue stained with [[hematoxylin]] and [[eosin]].]]\n[[H&E stain|Haematoxylin and eosin stain]]ing is frequently used in [[histology]] to examine thin tissue sections.<ref name=\"Bancroft and Stevens, 1982\">{{cite book|title=The Theory and Practice of Histological Techniques|date=1982|publisher=Longman Group Limited |editor1-last=Bancroft |editor2-last=Stevens|editor2-first=Alan | name-list-format = vanc |editor1-first=John|edition=2nd}}</ref>  [[Haematoxylin]] stains cell nuclei blue, while [[eosin]] stains cytoplasm, connective tissue and other extracellular substances pink or red.<ref name=\"Bancroft and Stevens, 1982\" />  Eosin is strongly absorbed by [[red blood cell]]s, colouring them bright red. In a skillfully made H&E preparation the red blood cells are almost orange, and collagen and cytoplasm (especially muscle) acquire different shades of pink.\n\n=== Papanicolaou staining ===\n{{main|Papanicolaou stain}}\n[[Papanicolaou stain]]ing, or PAP staining, was developed to replace fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in hopes of decreasing staining times and cost without compromising quality. This stain is a frequently used method for examining cell samples from a variety of tissue types in various organs. PAP staining has endured several modifications in order to become a \u201csuitable alternative\u201d for FNAC. This transition stemmed from the appreciation of wet fixed smears by scientists preserving the structures of the nuclei opposed to the opaque appearance of air dried Romanowsky smears. This led to the creation of a hybrid stain of wet fixed and air dried known as the ultrafast papanicolaou stain. This modification includes the use of nasal saline to rehydrate cells to increase cell transparency and is paired with the use of alcoholic formalin to enhance colors of the nuclei. The papanicolaou stain is now used in place of cytological staining in all organ types due to its increase in morphological quality, decreased staining time, and decreased cost. It is frequently used to stain [[Pap smear]] specimens.<ref name=\"Gill, 2013\">{{cite book|last1=Gill|first1=Gary W. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Cytopreparation|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4614-4932-4|series=Essentials in Cytopathology|volume=12|pages=143\u2013189|chapter=Papanicolaou Stain|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-4933-1_10|issn=1574-9053}}</ref> It uses a combination of [[haematoxylin]], [[Orange G]], [[eosin Y]], [[Light Green SF yellowish]], and sometimes [[Bismarck Brown Y]].<ref name=\"Bancroft and Stevens, 1982\" /><ref name=\"Gill, 2013\" /> <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Thakur M, Guttikonda VR | title = Modified ultrafast Papanicolaou staining technique: A comparative study | journal = Journal of Cytology | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 149\u2013153 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28701828 | pmc = 5492752 | doi = 10.4103/JOC.JOC_23_16 }}</ref>\n\n=== PAS staining ===\n{{main|Periodic acid\u2013Schiff stain}}\n[[Image:Histoplasma pas-d small.jpg|thumb|right|[[PAS diastase]] showing the fungus [[Histoplasma]].]]\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://labce.com/spg949466_periodic_acid_schiff_pas_diagnostic_applications.aspx|title=Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS): Diagnostic Applications - LabCE.com, Laboratory Continuing Education|website=labce.com|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>[[Periodic acid-Schiff]] is a histology special stain used to mark [[carbohydrate]]s ([[glycogen]], [[glycoprotein]], [[proteoglycan]]s). PAS is commonly used on liver tissue where glycogen deposits are made which is done in efforts to distinguish different types of glycogen storage diseases. PAS is important because it can detect glycogen granules found in tumors of the ovaries and pancreas of the endocrine system, as well as in the bladder and kidneys of the renal system. Basement membranes can also show up in a PAS stain and can be important when diagnosing renal disease. Due to the high volume of carbohydrates within the cell wall of hyphae and yeast forms of fungi, the Periodic acid -Schiff stain can help locate these species inside tissue samples of the human body.\n\n=== Masson's trichrome ===\n{{main|Masson's trichrome stain}}\n[[Masson's trichrome]] is (as the name implies) a three-colour staining protocol.  The recipe has evolved from Masson's original technique for different specific applications, but all are well-suited to distinguish cells from surrounding [[connective tissue]].  Most recipes produce red [[keratin]] and muscle fibers, blue or green staining of [[collagen]] and [[bone]], light red or pink staining of [[cytoplasm]], and black [[cell nucleus|cell nuclei]].\n\n=== Romanowsky stains ===\n{{main|Romanowsky stain}}\nThe [[Romanowsky stain]]s is considered a polychrome staining effect and is based on a combination of eosin plus (chemically [[reduction (chemistry)|reduced]] [[eosin]]) and demethylated [[methylene blue]] (containing its oxidation products [[azure A]] and [[azure B]]).  This stain develops varying colors for all cell structures (\u201cRomanowsky-Giemsa effect) and thus was used in staining neutrophil polymorphs and cell nuclei. Common variants include [[Wright's stain]], [[Jenner's stain]], May-Grunwald stain, [[Leishman stain]] and [[Giemsa stain]].\n\nAll are used to examine [[blood]] or [[bone marrow]] samples.  They are preferred over H&E for inspection of blood cells because different types of [[white blood cells|leukocytes]] (white blood cells) can be readily distinguished.  All are also suited to examination of blood to detect blood-borne parasites such as [[malaria]].<ref name = \"Bezrukov_2017\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bezrukov AV | title = Romanowsky staining, the Romanowsky effect and thoughts on the question of scientific priority | journal = Biotechnic & Histochemistry | volume = 92 | issue = 1 | pages = 29\u201335 | date = 2017-01-02 | pmid = 28098484 | doi = 10.1080/10520295.2016.1250285 }}</ref>\n\n=== Silver staining ===\n[[Image:Histoplasma in granuloma gms.jpg|thumb|right|[[G\u00f6m\u00f6ri methenamine silver stain]] demonstrating [[histoplasma]] (illustrated in black).]]\n[[Silver stain]]ing is the use of [[silver]] to stain [[histologic section]]s. This kind of staining is important in the demonstration of [[protein]]s (for example type III [[collagen]]) and [[DNA]]. It is used to show both substances inside and outside [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. Silver staining is also used in [[temperature gradient gel electrophoresis]].\n\n''Argentaffin cells'' [[Redox|reduce]] silver solution to metallic silver after [[formalin]] [[fixation (histology)|fixation]]. This method was discovered by Italian [[Camillo Golgi]], by using a reaction between [[silver nitrate]] and [[potassium dichromate]], thus precipitating silver chromate in some cells (see [[Golgi's method]]). A''rgyrophilic cells'' reduce silver solution to metallic silver after being exposed to the stain that contains a [[Reducing agent|reductant]]. An example of this would be [[hydroquinone]] or formalin.\n\n=== Sudan staining ===\n{{main|Sudan stain}}\n[[Sudan stain]]ing utilizes Sudan dyes to stain sudanophilic substances, often including [[lipid]]s. [[Sudan III]], [[Sudan IV]], [[Oil Red O]], [[Osmium tetroxide]], and [[Sudan Black B]] are often used. Sudan staining is often used to determine the level of [[fecal fat]] in diagnosing [[steatorrhea]].\n\n=== Wirtz-Conklin staining ===\nThe Wirtz-Conklin stain is a special technique designed for staining true endospores with the use of malachite green dye as the primary stain and safranin as the counterstain. Once stained, they do not decolourize. The addition of heat during the staining process is a huge contributing factor.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Corey L | title = Laboratory diagnosis of herpes simplex virus infections. Principles guiding the development of rapid diagnostic tests | journal = Diagnostic Microbiology and Infectious Disease | volume = 4 | issue = 3 Suppl | pages = 111S-119S | date = March 1986 | pmid = 3009082 | doi = 10.1016/s0732-8893(86)80049-9 }}</ref> Heat helps open the spore\u2019s membrane so the dye can enter. The main purpose of this stain is to show germination of bacterial spores. If the process of germination is taking place, then the spore will turn green in color due to malachite green and the surrounding cell will be red from the safranin. This stain can also help determine the orientation of the spore within the bacterial cell; whether it being terminal (at the tip), subterminal (within the cell), or central (completely in the middle of the cell).\n\n===Collagen Hybridizing Peptide Staining===\n{{main|Collagen Hybridizing Peptide}}\n[[Collagen Hybridizing Peptide]] (CHP) staining allows for an easy, direct way to stain denatured collagens of any type (Type I, II, IV, etc.) regardless if they were damaged or degraded via enzymatic, mechanical, chemical, or thermal means. They work by refolding into the collagen triple helix with the available single strands in the tissue. CHPs can be visualized by a simple [[fluorescence microscope]].\n\n== Common biological stains ==\nDifferent stains react or concentrate in different parts of a cell or tissue, and these properties are used to advantage to reveal specific parts or areas.  Some of the most common biological stains are listed below.  Unless otherwise marked, all of these dyes may be used with fixed cells and tissues; vital dyes (suitable for use with living organisms) are noted.\n\n=== Acridine orange ===\n[[Acridine orange]] (AO) is a nucleic acid selective fluorescent cationic dye useful for cell cycle determination. It is cell-permeable, and interacts with DNA and RNA by intercalation or electrostatic attractions. When bound to DNA, it is very similar spectrally to fluorescein. Like fluorescein, it is also useful as a non-specific stain for backlighting conventionally stained cells on the surface of a solid sample of tissue (fluorescence backlighted staining<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wells J | year = 1988 | title = A Technique for Staining the Superficial Cells of Plucked Hair Follicles and Other Solid Tissues | url = | journal = Stain Technology | volume = 63 | issue = 3 }}</ref>).\n\n=== Bismarck brown ===\n<ref>{{Cite journal| vauthors = Tomov N, Dimitrov N |date=2017|title=Modified bismarck brown staining for demonstration of soft tissue mast cells |url= http://tru.uni-sz.bg/tsj/Vol15_N3_2017/2_N.Tomov.pdf|journal=Trakia Journal of Science |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=195\u2013197 |doi=10.15547/tjs.2017.03.001 }}</ref>[[Bismarck brown Y|Bismarck brown]] (also Bismarck brown Y or Manchester brown) imparts a yellow colour to acid [[mucin]]s. and an intense brown color to mast cells. One default of this stain is that it blots out any other structure surrounding it and makes the quality of the contrast low. It has to be paired with other stains\u00a0 in order to be useful. Some complimenting stains used alongside Bismark brown are Hematoxylin and Toluidine blue which provide better contrast within the histology sample.\n\n=== Carmine ===\n[[Image:Pseudorhabdosynochus morrhua.jpg|thumb|[[Carmine]] staining of a parasitic flatworm.]]\n[[Carmine]] is an intensely red dye used to stain [[glycogen]], while Carmine alum is a nuclear stain.  Carmine stains require the use of a mordant, usually [[aluminum]].\n\n=== Coomassie blue ===\n[[Coomassie Brilliant Blue|Coomassie blue]] (also brilliant blue) nonspecifically stains proteins a strong blue colour.  It is often used in gel electrophoresis.\n\n===Cresyl violet===\n\n[[Cresyl violet stain|Cresyl violet]] stains the acidic components of the neuronal cytoplasm a violet colour, specifically [[Nissl body|nissl]] bodies. Often used in brain research.\n\n=== Crystal violet ===\n[[Crystal violet]], when combined with a suitable mordant, stains [[cell wall]]s purple.  Crystal violet is the stain used in Gram staining.\n\n=== DAPI ===\n[[DAPI]] is a [[fluorescent]] nuclear stain, excited by [[ultraviolet]] light and showing strong blue fluorescence when bound to [[DNA]].  DAPI binds with A=T rich repeats of chromosomes. DAPI is also not visible with regular transmission microscopy. It may be used in living or fixed cells. DAPI-stained cells are especially appropriate for cell counting.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Levenfus I | title = An efficient method for counting DAPI-stained cells using Fiji | publisher = Grin | location = Munich | date = 2011 | isbn = 978-3-640-86284-9 }}</ref>\n\n=== Eosin ===\n[[Eosin]] is most often used as a counterstain to haematoxylin, imparting a pink or red colour to [[cytoplasm]]ic material, [[cell membrane]]s, and some extracellular structures.  It also imparts a strong red colour to [[red blood cell]]s.  Eosin may also be used as a counterstain in some variants of Gram staining, and in many other protocols.  There are actually two very closely related compounds commonly referred to as eosin.  Most often used is [[eosin Y]] (also known as eosin Y ws or eosin yellowish); it has a very slightly yellowish cast.  The other eosin compound is eosin B (eosin bluish or imperial red); it has a very faint bluish cast.  The two dyes are interchangeable, and the use of one or the other is more a matter of preference and tradition.\n\n=== Ethidium bromide ===\n[[Ethidium bromide]] [[intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalates]] and stains DNA, providing a fluorescent red-orange stain. Although it will not stain healthy cells, it can be used to identify cells that are in the final stages of [[apoptosis]] \u2013 such cells have much more permeable [[biological membrane|membranes]]. Consequently, ethidium bromide is often used as a marker for apoptosis in cells populations and to locate bands of DNA in [[gel electrophoresis]]. The stain may also be used in conjunction with [[acridine orange]] (AO) in viable cell counting. This EB/AO combined stain causes live cells to fluoresce green whilst apoptotic cells retain the distinctive red-orange fluorescence.\n\n=== Acid fuchsin ===\n[[Fuchsine|Acid fuchsine]] may be used to stain collagen, smooth muscle, or [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]].\nAcid fuchsin is used as the nuclear and cytoplasmic stain in Mallory's trichrome method. Acid fuchsin stains cytoplasm in some variants of Masson's trichrome.  In Van Gieson's picro-fuchsine, acid fuchsin imparts its red colour to collagen fibres. Acid fuchsin is also a traditional stain for mitochondria (Altmann's method).\n\n=== Haematoxylin ===\n[[Haematoxylin]] (hematoxylin in North America) is a nuclear stain.<ref name=\"Bancroft and Stevens, 1982\" />  Used with a mordant, haematoxylin stains nuclei blue-violet or brown.<ref name=\"Bancroft and Stevens, 1982\" />  It is most often used with eosin in the [[H&E stain]] (haematoxylin and eosin) staining, one of the most common procedures in [[histology]].<ref name=\"Bancroft and Stevens, 1982\" />\n\n=== Hoechst stains ===\n[[Hoechst stain|Hoechst]] is a ''bis''-benzimidazole derivative compound that binds to the ''minor groove'' of [[DNA]]. Often used in fluorescence microscopy for DNA staining, Hoechst stains appear yellow when dissolved in aqueous solutions and emit blue light under UV excitation. There are two major types of [[Hoechst stain|Hoechst]]: ''Hoechst 33258'' and ''Hoechst 33342''. The two compounds are functionally similar, but with a little difference in structure. Hoechst 33258 contains a terminal [[hydroxyl]] group and is thus more soluble in aqueous solution, however this characteristics reduces its ability to penetrate the [[plasma membrane]]. Hoechst 33342 contains an [[ethyl group|ethyl]] substitution on the terminal hydroxyl group (i.e. an ethylether group) making it more hydrophobic for easier plasma membrane passage\n\n=== Iodine ===\n[[Iodine]] is used in [[chemistry]] as an indicator for [[starch]]. When starch is mixed with iodine in solution, an intensely dark blue colour develops, representing a starch/iodine complex. Starch is a substance common to most plant cells and so a weak iodine solution will stain starch present in the cells. Iodine is one component in the staining technique known as [[Gram staining]], used in [[microbiology]]. Used as a [[mordant]] in Gram's staining, iodine enhances the entrance of the dye through the pores present in the cell wall/membrane.\n\n[[Lugol's iodine|Lugol's solution]] or Lugol's iodine (IKI) is a brown solution that turns black in the presence of starches and can be used as a cell stain, making the cell [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] more visible.\n\nUsed with common vinegar (acetic acid), Lugol's solution is used to identify [[Cervical cancer#Diagnosis|pre-cancerous and cancerous changes]] in cervical and vaginal tissues during \"Pap smear\" follow up examinations in preparation for biopsy. The acetic acid causes the abnormal cells to blanch white, while the normal tissues stain a mahogany brown from the iodine.<ref>{{cite book | chapter = Chapter 4: An introduction to colposcopy: indications for colposcopy, instrumentation, principles and documentation of results | title = Colposcopy and treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: a beginners' manual | veditors = Sellors JW, Sankaranarayanan R | url =  http://screening.iarc.fr/colpochap.php?lang=1&chap=4 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190131040048/http://screening.iarc.fr/colpochap.php?lang=1&chap=4 | archive-date = 31 January 2019 | publisher = The World Health Organization }}</ref>\n\n=== Malachite green ===\n[[Malachite green]] (also known as diamond green B or victoria green B) can be used as a blue-green counterstain to safranin in the [[Gimenez stain|Gimenez staining technique]] for bacteria.  It can also be used to directly stain [[endospore|spores]].\n\n=== Methyl green ===\n[[Methyl green]] is used commonly with bright-field, as well as fluorescence microscopes <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Prieto D, Aparicio G, Morande PE, Zolessi FR | title = A fast, low cost, and highly efficient fluorescent DNA labeling method using methyl green | journal = Histochemistry and Cell Biology | volume = 142 | issue = 3 | pages = 335\u201345 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 24671497 | doi = 10.1007/s00418-014-1215-0 }}</ref> to dye the chromatin of cells so that they are more easily viewed.\n\n=== Methylene blue ===\n[[Methylene blue]] is used to stain animal cells, such as human cheek cells, to make their nuclei more observable. Also used to stain  blood films in cytology.\n\n=== Neutral red ===\n[[Neutral red]] (or toluylene red) stains [[Nissl body|Nissl substance]] red.  It is usually used as a counterstain in combination with other dyes.\n\n=== Nile blue ===\n[[Nile blue]] (or Nile blue A) stains nuclei blue.  It may be used with living cells.\n\n=== Nile red ===\n[[Nile red]] (also known as Nile blue oxazone) is formed by boiling Nile blue with [[sulfuric acid]].  This produces a mix of Nile red and Nile blue.  Nile red is a [[lipophilic]] stain; it will accumulate in [[lipid]] globules inside cells, staining them red.  Nile red can be used with living cells. It fluoresces strongly when partitioned into lipids, but practically not at all in aqueous solution.\n\n=== Osmium tetroxide (formal name: osmium tetraoxide) ===\n[[Osmium tetraoxide]] is used in optical microscopy to stain [[lipid]]s. It dissolves in fats, and is reduced by organic materials to elemental osmium, an easily visible black substance.\n\n=== Propidium Iodide ===\n[[Propidium iodide]] is a fluorescent intercalating agent that can be used to stain cells. Propidium iodide is used as a DNA stain in flow cytometry to evaluate cell viability or DNA content in cell cycle analysis, or in microscopy to visualise the nucleus and other DNA-containing organelles. Propidium Iodide cannot cross the membrane of live cells, making it useful to differentiate necrotic, apoptotic and healthy cells. PI also binds to RNA, necessitating treatment with nucleases to distinguish between RNA and DNA staining\n\n=== Rhodamine ===\n[[Rhodamine]] is a protein specific fluorescent stain commonly used in fluorescence microscopy.\n\n=== Safranine ===\n[[Safranine]] (or Safranine O) is a red cationic dye.  It binds to nuclei (DNA) and other tissue polyanions, including glycosaminoglycans in cartilage and mast cells, and components of lignin and plastids in plant tissues.<ref>Berlyn GP, Miksche JP (1976). ''Botanical Microtechnique and Cytochemistry''. Iowa State University Press.</ref>  Safranine should not be confused with saffron, an expensive natural dye that is used in some methods to impart a yellow colour to collagen, to contrast with blue and red colours imparted by other dyes to nuclei and cytoplasm in animal (including human) tissues.\n\nThe incorrect spelling \"safranin\" is in common use.

[[Chromosomes]] were so named because of their ability to absorb a violet stain.\n\nPositive affinity for a specific stain may be designated by the suffix ''-philic''. For example, tissues that stain with an [[azure stain]] may be referred to as [[azurophil]]ic. This may also be used for more generalized staining properties, such as [[Acidophile (histology)|acidophilic]] for tissues that stain by [[acidic]] stains (most notably [[eosin]]), [[basophilic]] when staining in [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] dyes, and ''amphophilic''<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/amphophilic thefreedictionary.com > amphophilic] Citing: ''Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary'', 3 ed. 2007 Elsevier, Inc</ref> when staining with either acid or basic dyes. In contrast, [[chromophobe|chromophobic]] tissues do not take up coloured dye readily.\n\n== Electron microscopy ==\nAs in light microscopy, stains can be used to enhance contrast in [[transmission electron microscopy]]. Electron-dense compounds of heavy metals are typically used.\n\n===Phosphotungstic acid===\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmrf.research.uiowa.edu/negative-staining|title=Negative Staining {{!}} Central Microscopy Research Facility|website=cmrf.research.uiowa.edu|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>[[Phosphotungstic acid]] is a common [[negative stain]] for [[virus]]es, [[nerve]]s, [[polysaccharide]]s, and other biological tissue materials. It is mostly used in a .5-2% ph form making it neutral and is paired with water to make an aqueous solution. Phosphotungstic acid is filled with electron dense matter that stains the background surrounding the specimen dark and the specimen itself light. This process is not the normal positive technique for staining where the specimen is dark and the background remains light.\n\n=== Osmium tetroxide ===\n[[Osmium tetroxide]] is used in optical microscopy to stain [[lipid]]s. It dissolves in fats, and is reduced by organic materials to elemental osmium, an easily visible black substance.  Because it is a heavy metal that absorbs electrons, it is perhaps the most common stain used for morphology in biological electron microscopy. It is also used for the staining of various polymers for the study of their morphology by TEM. {{chem|OsO|4}} is very volatile and extremely toxic. It is a strong oxidizing agent as the osmium has an oxidation number of +8. It aggressively oxidizes many materials, leaving behind a deposit of non-volatile osmium in a lower oxidation state.\n\n=== Ruthenium tetroxide ===\n[[Ruthenium tetroxide]] is equally volatile and even more aggressive than osmium tetraoxide and able to stain even materials that resist the osmium stain, e.g. polyethylene.\n\nOther chemicals used in electron microscopy staining include:\n[[ammonium molybdate]], [[cadmium iodide]], [[carbohydrazide]], [[ferric chloride]], [[hexamine]], [[indium trichloride]], [[lanthanum nitrate]], [[lead acetate]], [[lead citrate]], [[lead(II) nitrate]], [[periodic acid]], [[phosphomolybdic acid]], [[potassium ferricyanide]], [[potassium ferrocyanide]], [[ruthenium red]], [[silver nitrate]], [[silver proteinate]], [[sodium chloroaurate]], [[thallium nitrate]], [[thiosemicarbazide]], [[uranyl acetate]], [[uranyl nitrate]], and [[vanadyl sulfate]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Cell biology|Cytology]]: the study of cells\n* [[Histology]]: the study of tissues\n* [[Immunohistochemistry]]: the use of antisera to label specific antigens\n* [[Ruthenium(II) tris(bathophenanthroline disulfonate)]], a protein dye.\n* [[Vital stain]]: stains that do not kill cells\n* [[Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis|PAGE]]: separation of protein molecules\n*[[Barium enema]] - a type of in vivo stain that creates contrast in the x-ray part of the light spectrum\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | veditors = Bancroft JD, Gamble M | date = 2002 | title = Theory and Practice of Histological Techniques | edition = 5th | location = London | publisher = Churchill-Livingstone | isbn = 978-0-443-06435-7 }}\n* {{cite book | vauthors = Kiernan JA | date = 2015 | title = Histological and Histochemical Methods.
