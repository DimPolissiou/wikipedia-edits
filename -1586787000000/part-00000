The tunnel carries the [[BMT Canarsie Line]] (serving the {{NYCS trains|Canarsie}}) under the [[East River]] in New York City, connecting the boroughs of [[Brooklyn]] and [[Manhattan]], and is used by an average of 225,000 passengers per weekday. A key segment of the 14th Street Tunnel, between the [[Bedford Avenue (BMT Canarsie Line)|Bedford Avenue]] station in Brooklyn and the [[First Avenue (BMT Canarsie Line)|First Avenue]] station in Manhattan, would be partially closed for 15 to 20 months to allow for necessary and extensive repairs to the underwater tubes after it was flooded and severely damaged during [[Hurricane Sandy]] in 2012.\n\nTwo options were proposed in 2016: a three-year construction period where one tube at a time would be closed or an 18-month closure where both tubes would be worked on simultaneously. The [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] ultimately chose the 18-month closure option because it would be less disruptive to passenger service. The shutdown period was later reduced to 15 months to reduce service disruption. To accommodate displaced passengers, new or expanded bus, subway, and ferry service was to be added, and a [[14th Street busway]] would have been implemented. The shutdown plan was criticized by riders who use the {{NYCS trains|Canarsie|time=nolink}} and people living along or near [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]] in Manhattan, as it would have had adverse effects on other subway routes and on vehicular traffic. In January 2019, it was announced that the shutdown would not be a full-time closure, but a night and weekend closure. Ultimately, the line was not closed; night and weekend service was merely reduced.<ref name=\"L Project\"/>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Canarsie (8168179049).jpg|thumb|Damaged tunnels after draining]]\nIn October 2012, [[Hurricane Sandy]] caused [[Hurricane Sandy in New York|severe damage to New York City]], and many subway tunnels were inundated with floodwater. The subway opened with limited service two days after the storm and was running at 80 percent capacity within five days; however, some infrastructure needed years of repair. A year after the storm, a spokesman for the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA), which operates the New York City Subway, said that Hurricane Sandy \"was unprecedented in terms of the amount of damage that we were seeing throughout the system.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Boissoneault |first1=Lorraine |title=Superstorm Sandy Anniversary \u2013 How the Subway Survived |url=http://www.weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/devastating-effects-water-how-superstorm-sandy-shut-down-subway-swamped-city |website=The Weather Channel |accessdate=November 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe storm flooded nine of the system's 14 underwater tunnels, many subway lines and yards, and completely destroyed a portion of the [[IND Rockaway Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Rockaway}}) in [[Queens]], as well as much of the [[South Ferry (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|South Ferry]] terminal at [[Manhattan]]'s southern tip. Reconstruction required many weekend closures on several lines and long-term closures on the [[IND Crosstown Line|Greenpoint Tunnel]] ({{NYCS trains|Crosstown}}), [[Montague Street Tunnel]] ({{NYCS trains|Fourth Montague header}}), Rockaway Line, and the South Ferry station. A long-term closure was planned for the 14th Street Tunnel because it was significantly damaged by the storm surge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/sandy/nyct_girds.htm|title=mta.info {{!}} Superstorm Sandy: One Year Later|website=web.mta.info|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|access-date=July 23, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803224532/http://web.mta.info/sandy/nyct_girds.htm|archive-date=August 3, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Moreover, the 14th Street Tunnel dates from 1924;<ref>{{cite news |title=Celebrate Opening of Subway Link |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1924/07/01/archives/celebrate-opening-of-subway-link-civic-and-city-officials-ride-in.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 1, 1924 |accessdate=February 13, 2010}}</ref> thus its equipment was already 88 years old when Hurricane Sandy occurred.<ref name=\"Surico 2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yweynb/whats-actually-wrong-with-the-l-train-tunnel|title=What's Actually Wrong with the L Train Tunnel?|last=Surico|first=John|date=June 29, 2018|website=Vice|access-date=July 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Planning==\n\n=== Closure options ===\nIn January 2016, the Canarsie Line between [[Bedford Avenue (BMT Canarsie Line)|Bedford Avenue]] in [[Brooklyn]] and [[Eighth Avenue (BMT Canarsie Line station)|Eighth Avenue]] in [[Manhattan]] was proposed for either of two shutdown options.<ref name=\":0\" /> One option involved shuttering the entire segment for eighteen months.

The demolition and replacement of the tunnels' wire duct banks, or benchwalls, were to take up much the project's duration. A dust collection machine, which was custom-ordered for the 14th Street Tunnel project, was to include ventilation and dust filtration systems that allow dust to be contained within the tunnels. The dust was to be taken out of the tunnels via flatbed cars that travel to the shafts at Avenue A in Manhattan and Driggs Avenue in Brooklyn. The demolition was to be completed within three months, after which work on the new station entrances and replacement duct banks would commence. The tracks within the tunnels were also be replaced.<ref name=\"Surico 2018\" /> These repairs would be able to last up to eighty years.<ref name=\"NYTimes-LTrainSully-2019\"/>\n\nFollowing the January 2019 announcement that the shutdown would instead be a partial closure, Cuomo and the MTA board unveiled some new details about the project.

By the original closure date for the Canarsie tubes in April 2019, nearly half of that work had been completed. According to the ''New York Daily News'', the extent of the work being done could result in a shortened service suspension.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-l-train-construction-solution-benchwall-20190425-hlr6er2p3zed5l4lwserhtgnnu-story.html|title=EXCLUSIVE: L-Pocalypse not \u2014 MTA has already completed the bulk of L train construction|last=Guse|first=Clayton|website=nydailynews.com|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref> However, the change in plans led to delays in the rehabilitation of the Canarsie Line's five stations within Manhattan. {{As of|August 2019}} the improvements were not set to start until 2020, whereas under the previous plan, the stations would have been renovated while the tunnel was closed.

The tunnel carries the [[BMT Canarsie Line]] (serving the {{NYCS trains|Canarsie}}) under the [[East River]] in New York City, connecting the boroughs of [[Brooklyn]] and [[Manhattan]], and is used by an average of 225,000 passengers per weekday. A key segment of the 14th Street Tunnel, between the [[Bedford Avenue (BMT Canarsie Line)|Bedford Avenue]] station in Brooklyn and the [[First Avenue (BMT Canarsie Line)|First Avenue]] station in Manhattan, would be partially closed for 15 to 20 months to allow for necessary and extensive repairs to the underwater tubes after it was flooded and severely damaged during [[Hurricane Sandy]] in 2012.\n\nTwo options were proposed in 2016: a three-year construction period where one tube at a time would be closed or an 18-month closure where both tubes would be worked on simultaneously. The [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] ultimately chose the 18-month closure option because it would be less disruptive to passenger service. The shutdown period was later reduced to 15 months to reduce service disruption. To accommodate displaced passengers, new or expanded bus, subway, and ferry service was to be added, and a [[14th Street busway]] would have been implemented. The shutdown plan was criticized by riders who use the {{NYCS trains|Canarsie|time=nolink}} and people living along or near [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]] in Manhattan, as it would have had adverse effects on other subway routes and on vehicular traffic. In January 2019, it was announced that the shutdown would not be a full-time closure, but a night and weekend closure. Ultimately, the line was not closed; night and weekend service was merely reduced.<ref name=\"L Project\"/>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Canarsie (8168179049).jpg|thumb|Damaged tunnels after draining]]\nIn October 2012, [[Hurricane Sandy]] caused [[Hurricane Sandy in New York|severe damage to New York City]], and many subway tunnels were inundated with floodwater. The subway opened with limited service two days after the storm and was running at 80 percent capacity within five days; however, some infrastructure needed years of repair. A year after the storm, a spokesman for the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA), which operates the New York City Subway, said that Hurricane Sandy \"was unprecedented in terms of the amount of damage that we were seeing throughout the system.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Boissoneault |first1=Lorraine |title=Superstorm Sandy Anniversary \u2013 How the Subway Survived |url=http://www.weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/devastating-effects-water-how-superstorm-sandy-shut-down-subway-swamped-city |website=The Weather Channel |accessdate=November 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe storm flooded nine of the system's 14 underwater tunnels, many subway lines and yards, and completely destroyed a portion of the [[IND Rockaway Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Rockaway}}) in [[Queens]], as well as much of the [[South Ferry (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|South Ferry]] terminal at [[Manhattan]]'s southern tip. Reconstruction required many weekend closures on several lines and long-term closures on the [[IND Crosstown Line|Greenpoint Tunnel]] ({{NYCS trains|Crosstown}}), [[Montague Street Tunnel]] ({{NYCS trains|Fourth Montague header}}), Rockaway Line, and the South Ferry station.

The demolition and replacement of the tunnels' wire duct banks, or benchwalls, were to take up much the project's duration. A dust collection machine, which was custom-ordered for the 14th Street Tunnel project, was to include ventilation and dust filtration systems that allow dust to be contained within the tunnels. The dust was to be taken out of the tunnels via flatbed cars that travel to the shafts at Avenue A in Manhattan and Driggs Avenue in Brooklyn. The demolition was to be completed within three months, after which work on the new station entrances and replacement duct banks would commence. The tracks within the tunnels were also be replaced.<ref name=\"Surico 2018\" /> These repairs would be able to last up to eighty years.<ref name=\"NYTimes-LTrainSully-2019\"/>\n\nFollowing the January 2019 announcement that the shutdown would instead be a partial closure, Cuomo and the MTA board unveiled some new details about the project. Rather than completely replacing the benchwall, workers would install new cable ducts on the sides of the existing tunnel walls, and the existing ducts would be abandoned.<ref name=\"MTA-Canarsie-Jan2019\">{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/docs/Canarsie%20-%20Board%20Presentation%20011519%201120%20FINAL.pdf|title=L Project Update New Design Recommendations Overall Project Update|date=January 15, 2019|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|access-date=January 18, 2019}}</ref>{{rp|7}}<ref name=\"Berger 2019\" /><ref name=\":9\" /> The technique of racking the cables on the wall differed from previous proposals, in that a rack, rather than the cables themselves, would be bolted onto the wall.<ref name=\"NYTimes-TransportationPurgatory-2019\"/><ref name=MTA-Canarsie-Jan2019/>{{rp|9}} The benchwalls would be repaired with [[epoxy]] and [[fiberglass]] as necessary, then converted into emergency egress walkways.<ref name=MTA-Canarsie-Jan2019/>{{rp|7, 11}}<ref name=\"Berger 2019\" /><ref name=\":9\" /> By using this approach, less silica would need to be extracted from the tunnels because the benchwalls would not be entirely demolished.<ref name=MTA-Canarsie-Jan2019/>{{rp|12}} [[Optical fiber|Fiber-optic]] and [[lidar]] sensors would be installed to allow MTA workers to more easily track imminent failures in the benchwalls.<ref name=\"Hawkins 2019\" /> Station and track improvements would continue under the revised proposal.<ref name=MTA-Canarsie-Jan2019/>{{rp|21}} The repairs could last for up to forty years, and work might be elongated due to the need to maintain weekday service.<ref name=\"NYTimes-LTrainSully-2019\"/>\n\nThe new plan meant that only 1% of the benchwall would have to be removed, namely the concrete surrounding 96 manholes.

He joined [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] as an apprentice, but was released and moved to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] to complete his apprenticeship, earning England Youth honours in the process. He turned professional in May 1967 and made his league debut the following season.\n\nHe was transferred to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] on 1 February 1968 for \u00a326,500. He scored on his debut against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] with a header on 26 February but missed the next game on 2 March as it was his wedding day.

He moved to Canada and spent two months playing for the Toronto Nationals, joining [[Chesham United F.C.|Chesham United]] on his return to Britain. He subsequently joined [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] on non-contract terms before being persuaded by [[David Webb (footballer)|David Webb]] to join [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] in February 1984.
