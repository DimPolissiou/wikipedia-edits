These creatures, with [[squid]]-like [[tentacle]]s, large [[eye]]s, and [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]], materialize into a room and say, \"Yip-yip-yip-yip... Uh-huh. Uh-huh\", in monotone voices. They come across common objects and, curious as to their names and functions, the Yip Yips consult a [[book]] they call \"Earth book\" which presumably contains information about things on Earth. For example, in one skit the Yip Yips try communicating with a [[telephone]] by common greetings such as \"Hello\", \"Greetings\", and \"Hi there!\" unsuccessfully. After each failure they say \"nope nope nope\". Next they address the phone as a [[cow]], a [[cat]], and then a [[chicken]], only finally learning what it really is when it rings. They \"ring\" back at it with their voices, clearly pleased to have identified and established communication with it.They marvel at devices such as clocks, telephones and computers.  When frightened, each covers its face with the lower part of its jaw while making a distinctive \"goom\" noise.\n\nIn one skit, they struggle to decide what to do with a book, possibly not having acquired their \"Earth Book\" yet. After trying to eat, smell, and hear the book, a wind picks up and opens the pages. After the Martians had recovered from their shock they began to read the words.\n\nThey are \"Yip Yipped\" by multiple muppeteers including [[Jim Henson]], [[Frank Oz]], [[Jerry Nelson]], [[Martin P. Robinson]], and [[Kevin Clash]].  The puppets have a very simple design, controlled entirely by two rods (one for the body and eyes, the other for the front of the mouth).  This allows their entire bodies to be seen on camera, appearing to float in the air.\n\nThe two Yip Yips seen most often are called \"Bob\" and \"Joe\". On the Dutch version, ''[[Sesamstraat]]'', the Yip Yips are called \"Sjoerd and Hendrik Marsman\", referring to the early 20th-century poet [[Hendrik Marsman]].

Their western boundary was defined by the margin of the rain forest from [[Tolga, Queensland|Tolga]] north to [[Mount Molloy, Queensland|Mount Molloy]]. By 1952, the Djabugay claimed also the coastal strip between Cairns Inlet and Lamb Range, with one [[Band society|''horde'']] lived near [[Redlynch, Queensland|Redlynch]],{{sfn|Tindale|1974}} [[Cairns]].{{efn|Cairns was known among the Yidinji people as ''Gimuy'', slippery blue fig tree (Ficus albipila) which is common to the area. {{harv|Dixon|1991|p=1}}}}\n\n==Mythology==\n[[File:QRail Budaji.jpg|thumb|250px|Buda-dji painted onto the front the Queensland Rail engine ascending the Barron Gorge, to Kuranda|alt=|left]]\nThe Djabugay word for their [[Australian_Aboriginal_religion_and_mythology#Pan-Australian_mythology| ancestral times, beyond their living memory, (also known as 'Story time' or 'Dreamtime')]] is  ''bulurru''{{sfn|Henry|1998|p=153, n.40}} being a time when, for instance, it is told the [[Rainbow Serpent]] ''Gudju Gudju'', in the form of a giant [[Morelia spilota variegata|carpet snake]] (aka ''Budadji'') traveled through the country, bartering with families along the way exchanging coastal [[nautilus shell]]s for rainforest products such as [[dilly bag]]s, his body creating within the landscape everything from ''Yaln giri'' ([[Crystal Cascades]]) to ''Ngunbay'' ([[Kuranda, Queensland|Kuranda]]), moving through the [[Mowbray River (Queensland)|Mowbray River]] to the hill at Port Douglas, finally coming to rest at ''Wangal Djungay'' ([[Double Island, Queensland|Double Island]]){{sfn|Pannell|2009|p=376}}{{sfn|Bottoms|1999|p=4}} In one account, he was killed by [[emu]] men at '''Din din'' ( the [[Barron Falls]]), an incident which unleashed the powerful [[monsoon]]al rains on the region.{{sfn|Morton-Evans|Morton-Evans|2009|p=141}} There were also 2 Bulurru dreamtime brothers, Damarri and Guyala, who laid down the contours, created the plant foods, established the customary law and the system of clan marriage by [[Australian Aboriginal kinship|moieties]]. The contours of the Barron River and Redlynch Valley, for example, are thought of as representing the supine body of Damarri.\n\nThe tale of Budadji's travels along the Barron Gorge is included in the web guide of [[Queensland Rail]] to the railways journey from Cairns to Kuranda.{{sfn|Kuranda|2016}}\n\n==History==\nEuropean settlers explored and cleared the land for [[gold]] and [[tin]]. \"Dispersals\", the euphemism for shooting groups of blacks, were undertaken at [[Smithfield, Queensland|Smithfield]] (1878), at [[Biboohra, Queensland|Biboohra]] near the Clohesy River close to [[Kuranda, Queensland|Kuranda]] in the early 1880s, and also near [[Mareeba]] in 1881.{{sfn|Stone|2016|p=248}}\n\nIn May 1886, a railway was constructed from [[Cairns]] to [[Herberton]] with part of the rails going on top of a walking track. The Djabugay were unhappy about this development and withstood the settlement by spearing bullocks and settlers. As the settlers entered, traditional hunting and gathering grounds were taken over.\n\nThis led to the notorious Speewah massacre in 1890 where [[John Atherton (pioneer)|John Atherton]] took revenge on the Djubagay by sending in native troopers to avenge the killing of a bullock.{{sfn|Stone|2016|p=248}} The Djubagay were segregated from them and forced to live at the [[Mona-Mona Mission]] and were unable to hunt, fish or move around. Their numbers fell dramatically at the turn of the century.\n\nBy 1896, the region supported [[coffee]] plantations and the Djabugay were used as labour on farms.\n\nMany now own their own land, some other settlements and farms in the area.\n\nOn 17 December 2004, it was recognised that native title existed in the [[Barron Gorge National Park]] for the Djabugay..\n\n==Native title==\nAll Djabugay peoples share, in common, [[Kinship and descent#Descent and the family|descent]] from ancestors who (a) have been given personal names that are sourced from, spoken in, and almost exclusively belong to the [[Djabugay language]]s (or dialects) and who (b)have transmitted, from generation to generation, Djabugay language (or dialects), Djabugay knowledge, Djabugay tradition, Djabugay heritage, plus Djabugay law.{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn 2004, [[Jeffrey Spender (judge)|Justice Jeffrey Spender]], a [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court judge]], in analyzing Djabugay land claims in terms of Australian legislation regarding [[native title]], touched on the concept of ''bulurru'' and affirmed that for them the geomorphic features of the area affirm the truth of the laws instituted by the dreamtime, and are taken as tangible proof of bulurru and the totemic beings in Djabugay country. It followed that the physical landscape, its \"storyplaces\" and \"storywaters\" in bulurru tradition underline the 'inalienable connection between the native claimants, their ancestral beings and the land.{{sfn|NNTT|2004}}{{sfn|NNTT|2005}}\n\nIn land title claims, there was a long running dispute between the Djabugay and the [[Yirrganydji people|Yirrganydji]] the latter claiming [[Native title in Australia|native title]] to the area from Cairns to Port Douglas. The clash arose out of the siting of the Tjapukai Cultural Theme Park. Though some Djabuguy wished their claim to be included under the general claim, regarding them as part of the Dajabugay people, the Yirrganydji insisted on maintaining their separate identity.
