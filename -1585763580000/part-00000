He wrote approximately 2,900 poems, two autobiographical novels, four plays, and several essays. He is often regarded as one of the most important American poets of the 20th century.\nCummings is associated with [[Modernist literature|modernist]] [[free verse|free-form poetry]]. Much of his work has idiosyncratic syntax and uses lower case spellings for poetic expression. His use of lower case extended to rendering even the personal pronoun ''I'' as ''i'', as in the phrase \"i shall go.\u201d\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early years===\nEdward Estlin Cummings was born on October 14, 1894 in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] to Edward Cummings and the former Rebecca Haswell Clarke, a well-known [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] couple in the city. His father was a professor at Harvard University who later became nationally known as the minister of South Congregational Church (Unitarian) in Boston, Massachusetts.<ref>Collins, Leo W. ''This is Our Church''. Boston, Massachusetts: Society of the First Church in Boston, 2005: 104.</ref> His mother, who loved to spend time with her children, played games with Cummings and his sister, Elizabeth.

He grew up in the company of such family friends as the philosophers [[William James]] and [[Josiah Royce]]. Many of Cummings' summers were spent on [[Silver Lake (Madison, New Hampshire)|Silver Lake]] in [[Madison, New Hampshire]], where his father had built two houses along the eastern shore.

As he matured, Cummings moved to an [[I and Thou|\"I, Thou\"]] relationship with God. His journals are replete with references to ''\"le bon Dieu\"'', as well as prayers for inspiration in his poetry and artwork (such as \"Bon Dieu! may i some day do something truly great. amen.\"). Cummings \"also prayed for strength to be his essential self ('may I be I is the only prayer\u2014not may I be great or good or beautiful or wise or strong'), and for relief of spirit in times of depression ('almighty God!

On the boat to France, he met [[William Slater Brown]] and they would become friends. Due to an administrative error, Cummings and Brown did not receive an assignment for five weeks, a period they spent exploring Paris.

They were known to prefer the company of French soldiers over fellow ambulance drivers. The two openly expressed anti-war views; Cummings spoke of his lack of hatred for the Germans.<ref>Friedman, Norman \"Cummings, E[dward] E[stlin]\", in Steven Serafin, ''The Continuum Encyclopedia of American Literature'', 2003, Continuum, p. 244.</ref> On September 21, 1917, five months after starting his belated assignment, Cummings and William Slater Brown were arrested by the French military on suspicion of espionage and undesirable activities. They were held for three and a half months in a military detention camp at the ''[[La Fert\u00e9-Mac\u00e9|D\u00e9p\u00f4t de Triage]]'', in [[La Fert\u00e9-Mac\u00e9]], Orne, Normandy.<ref name=utexas/>\n\nThey were imprisoned with other detainees in a large room. Cummings' father failed to obtain his son's release through diplomatic channels, and in December 1917 he wrote a letter to President [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Cummings was released on December 19, 1917, and Brown was released two months later. Cummings used his prison experience as the basis for his novel, ''[[The Enormous Room]]'' (1922), about which [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] said, \"Of all the work by young men who have sprung up since 1920 one book survives\u2014''The Enormous Room'' by e e cummings...

His collection ''Tulips and Chimneys'' was published in 1923 and his inventive use of grammar and syntax is evident. The book was heavily cut by his editor. ''XLI Poems'' was published in 1925. With these collections, Cummings made his reputation as an avant garde poet.<ref Name=\"PoetryF\"/>\n\nDuring the rest of the 1920s and 1930s, Cummings returned to Paris a number of times, and traveled throughout Europe, meeting, among others, artist [[Pablo Picasso]]. In 1931 Cummings traveled to the [[Soviet Union]], recounting his experiences in ''[[Eimi (book)|Eimi]]'', published two years later. During these years Cummings also traveled to Northern Africa and [[Mexico]]. He worked as an essayist and portrait artist for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine (1924\u20131927).\n\nIn 1926, Cummings' parents were in a car crash; only his mother survived, although she was severely injured. Cummings later described the crash in the following passage from his ''i: six nonlectures'' series given at Harvard (as part of the [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]]) in 1952 and 1953:\n\n<blockquote>\nA locomotive cut the car in half, killing my father instantly. When two brakemen jumped from the halted train, they saw a woman standing \u2013 dazed but erect \u2013 beside a mangled machine; with blood spouting (as the older said to me) out of her head. One of her hands (the younger added) kept feeling her dress, as if trying to discover why it was wet. These men took my sixty-six-year old mother by the arms and tried to lead her toward a nearby farmhouse; but she threw them off, strode straight to my father's body, and directed a group of scared spectators to cover him. When this had been done (and only then) she let them lead her away.\n</blockquote>\n\nHis father's death had a profound effect on Cummings, who entered a new period in his artistic life. He began to focus on more important aspects of life in his poetry. He started this new period by paying homage to his father in the poem \"my father moved through dooms of love\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~richie/poetry/html/aupoem114.html |title=My father moved through dooms of love |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050315070117/http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~richie/poetry/html/aupoem114.html |archivedate=March 15, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | first = Gary | last = Lane | authorlink =  | year = 1976 | title = I Am: A Study of E.

His longest relationship lasted more than three decades, a [[common-law marriage]] to Marion Morehouse.\n\nCummings' first marriage, to Elaine Orr, began as a love affair in 1918 while she was still married to [[Scofield Thayer]], one of Cummings' friends from Harvard. During this time he wrote a good deal of his erotic poetry.<ref name=\"Kennedy\">''Selected Poems,'' Ed. Richard S. Kennedy, Liveright, 1994.</ref> After divorcing Thayer, Orr married Cummings on March 19, 1924. The couple had a daughter together out of wedlock.

That same year, Minnerly obtained a [[Mexican divorce]]; it was not officially recognized in the United States until August 1934. Anne died in 1970 aged 72.\n\nIn 1934, after his separation from his second wife, Cummings met Marion Morehouse, a fashion model and photographer.

William Pratt), AMS Inc, New York 1985  {{ISBN|0404615791}}</ref>), much of his work is quite traditional. Many of his poems are [[sonnet]]s, albeit often with a modern twist. He occasionally used the [[blues#Lyrics|blues]] form and [[acrostics]]. Cummings' poetry often deals with themes of love and nature, as well as the relationship of the individual to the masses and to the world. His poems are also often rife with satire.\n\nWhile his poetic forms and themes share an affinity with the [[Romanticism|Romantic tradition]], Cummings' work universally shows a particular idiosyncrasy of [[syntax]], or way of arranging individual words into larger phrases and sentences. Many of his most striking poems do not involve any typographical or punctuation innovations at all, but purely syntactic ones.\n\n<!---NB **The typography is Cummings' original setting**--->\n{{Quote box |width=350px |align=right ||salign=right\n |quote  =<poem>\ni carry your heart with me(i carry it in\nmy heart)i am never without it(anywhere\ni go you go,my dear;and whatever is done\nby only me is your doing,my darling)\n                                            i fear\nno fate(for you are my fate,my sweet)i want\nno world(for beautiful you are my world,my true)\nand it's you are whatever a moon has always meant\nand whatever a sun will always sing is you\n\nhere is the deepest secret nobody knows\n(here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud\nand the sky of the sky of a tree called life;which grows\nhigher than soul can hope or mind can hide)\nand this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart\n\ni carry your heart(i carry it in my heart)\n</poem>\n |source =From \"i carry your heart with me(i carry it in\" (1952)<ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/179622 \"i carry your heart with me(i carry it in\"] at the Poetry Foundation.</ref>}}\n\nAs well as being influenced by notable [[Modernist literature|modernists]], including [[Gertrude Stein]] and [[Ezra Pound]], Cummings in his early work drew upon the [[Imagism|imagist]] experiments of [[Amy Lowell]]. Later, his visits to Paris exposed him to [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]], which he reflected in his work. He began to rely on symbolism and allegory, where he once had used simile and metaphor. In his later work, he rarely used comparisons that required objects that were not previously mentioned in the poem, choosing to use a symbol instead. Due to this, his later poetry is \"frequently more lucid, more moving, and more profound than his earlier.\"<ref>Friedman, Norman. ''E. E. Cummings the Art of His Poetry.'' Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 1967. p. 89.</ref> Cummings also liked to incorporate imagery of nature and death into much of his poetry.\n\nWhile some of his poetry is [[free verse]] (with no concern for [[rhyme]] or [[meter (poetry)|meter]]), many have a recognizable sonnet structure of 14 lines, with an intricate rhyme scheme. A number of his poems feature a typographically exuberant style, with words, parts of words, or punctuation symbols scattered across the page, often making little sense until read aloud, at which point the meaning and emotion become clear. Cummings, who was also a painter, understood the importance of presentation, and used typography to \"paint a picture\" with some of his poems.<ref>{{cite journal | first = Iain | last = Landles | authorlink = Iain Landles | year = 2001 | title = An Analysis of Two Poems by E. E. Cummings | journal=SPRING, the Journal of the E. E. Cummings Society | volume = 10 | pages = 31\u201343 }}</ref>\n\nThe seeds of Cummings' unconventional style appear well established even in his earliest work. At age six, he wrote to his father:\n\n<blockquote><small>FATHER DEAR. BE, YOUR FATHER-GOOD AND GOOD,<br>\nHE IS GOOD NOW, IT IS NOT GOOD TO SEE IT RAIN,<br>\nFATHER DEAR IS, IT, DEAR, NO FATHER DEAR,<br>\nLOVE, YOU DEAR,<br>\nESTLIN.</small><ref>''Selected letters of E. E. Cummings'', (1972) Edward Estlin Cummings, Frederick Wilcox Dupee, George Stade. University of Michigan p. 3 {{ISBN|978-0-233-95637-4}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nFollowing his autobiographical novel, ''[[The Enormous Room]]'', Cummings' first published work was a collection of poems titled ''[[Tulips and Chimneys]]'' (1923). This work was the public's first encounter with his characteristic eccentric use of grammar and punctuation.\n\nSome of Cummings' most famous poems do not involve much, if any, odd typography or punctuation, but still carry his unmistakable style, particularly in unusual and impressionistic word order.\n\n{{Quote box |width=300px |align=right ||salign=right\n |quote  =<poem>\nanyone lived in a pretty how town\n(with up so floating many bells down)\nspring summer autumn winter\nhe sang his didn't he danced his did\n\nWomen and men (both little and small)\ncared for anyone not at all\nthey sowed their isn't they reaped their same\nsun moon stars rain\n</poem>\n |source =From \"[[anyone lived in a pretty how town]]\" (1940)<ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/11856 \"anyone lived in a pretty how town\" at the Poetry Foundation]</ref>}}\n\nCummings' work often does not proceed in accordance with the conventional combinatorial rules that generate typical English sentences (for example, \"they sowed their isn't\"). In addition, a number of Cummings' poems feature, in part or in whole, intentional misspellings, and several incorporate phonetic spellings intended to represent particular dialects. Cummings also made use of inventive formations of compound words, as in \"in Just\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/images/modeng/public/Cum2Dia/CumDi580.jpg |title=in Just}}</ref> which features words such as \"mud-luscious\", \"puddle-wonderful\", and \"eddieandbill.\" This poem is part of a sequence of poems titled ''Chansons Innocentes'';<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15398 |title=''Chansons Innocentes'' |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227115128/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15398 |archive-date=December 27, 2005 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> it has many references comparing the \"balloonman\" to [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], the mythical creature that is half-goat and half-man. Literary critic [[R.P. Blackmur]] has commented that this use of language is \"frequently unintelligible because [Cummings] disregards the historical accumulation of meaning in words in favour of merely private and personal associations.\"<ref>Friedman, Norman. ''E. E. Cummings the Art of His Poetry''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1967. pp. 61\u201362.</ref>\n\nFellow poet [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]], in her equivocal letter recommending Cummings for the [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] he was awarded in 1934, expressed her frustration at his opaque symbolism. \"[I]f he prints and offers for sale poetry which he is quite content should be, after hours of sweating concentration, inexplicable from any point of view to a person as intelligent as myself, then he does so with a motive which is frivolous from the point of view of art, and should not be helped or encouraged by any serious person or group of persons... there is fine writing and powerful writing (as well as some of the most pompous nonsense I ever let slip to the floor with a wide yawn)... What I propose, then, is this: that you give Mr. Cummings enough rope. He may hang himself; or he may lasso a unicorn.\"<ref>Millay to Mr. Moe of the Guggenheim Foundation, March 1934. Quoted in Milford, Nancy (2001) ''Savage Beauty: The Life of Edna St. Vincent Millay'', Doubleday: New York, NY. p370.</ref>\n\nMany of Cummings' poems are satirical and address social issues<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15404 |title=why must itself up every of a park |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813233241/http://poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15404 |archive-date=August 13, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> but have an equal or even stronger bias toward romanticism: time and again his poems celebrate love, sex, and the season of rebirth.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15403 |title=anyone lived in a pretty how town |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726121247/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15403 |archive-date=July 26, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nCummings also wrote children's books and novels. A notable example of his versatility is an introduction he wrote for a collection of the comic strip ''[[Krazy Kat]]''.\n\n===Controversy===\nCummings is known for controversial subject matter, as he wrote numerous erotic poems. He also sometimes included ethnic slurs in his writing. For instance, in his 1950 collection ''Xaipe: Seventy-One Poems'', Cummings published two poems containing words that caused outrage in some quarters.<ref>Friedman, Norman, and Harry Thornton Moore. ''E. E. Cummings the Growth of a Writer''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois UP, 1964. pp. 153\u201354.</ref>\n\n:<poem>\n:one day a nigger\n:caught in his hand\n:a little star no bigger\n:than not to understand\n\n:i'll never let you go\n:until you've made me white\"\n:so she did and now\n:stars shine at night.<ref name=\"Cummings, 1950\">Cummings, ''Xaipe, Seventy-one Poems''.

All the fuss perplexed him. The poems were commenting on prejudice, he pointed out, and not condoning it. He intended to show how derogatory words cause people to see others in terms of stereotypes rather than as individuals. \"America (which turns Hungarian into 'hunky' & Irishman into 'mick' and Norwegian into 'square- head') is to blame for 'kike,'\" he said.<ref Name=\"Reef\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[William Carlos Williams]] spoke out in his defense.<ref Name=\"Reef\">''E. Cummings'' (2006) by Catherine Reef, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt p. 115 {{ISBN|978-0-618-56849-9}}</ref>{{Clarify|reason=|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Plays===\nDuring his lifetime, Cummings published four plays. ''[[Him (Cummings play)|HIM]]'', a three-act play, was first produced in 1928 by the [[Provincetown Players]] in New York City. The production was directed by James Light. The play's main characters are \"Him\", a playwright, portrayed by [[William Johnstone (actor)|William Johnstone]], and \"Me\", his girlfriend, portrayed by [[Erin O'Brien-Moore]].\n\nCummings said of the unorthodox play:\n<blockquote>Relax and give the play a chance to strut its stuff\u2014relax, stop wondering what it is all 'about'\u2014like many strange and familiar things, Life included, this play isn't 'about,' it simply is. . . . Don't try to enjoy it, let it try to enjoy you. <small>DON'T TRY TO UNDERSTAND IT, LET IT TRY TO UNDERSTAND YOU.</small>\"<ref>Kennedy, p. 295.</ref></blockquote>\n\n''Anthropos, or the Future of Art'' is a short, one-act play that Cummings contributed to the anthology ''Whither, Whither or After Sex, What? A Symposium to End Symposium''. The play consists of dialogue between Man, the main character, and three \"infrahumans\", or inferior beings. The word ''[[Greek language|anthropos]]'' is the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for \"man\", in the sense of \"mankind\".\n\n''Tom, A Ballet'' is a ballet based on ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''. The ballet is detailed in a \"synopsis\" as well as descriptions of four \"episodes\", which were published by Cummings in 1935. It has never been performed.<ref>[http://www.gvsu.edu/english/cummings/Tom.html GVSU.edu The E. E. Cummings Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050423191607/http://www.gvsu.edu/english/cummings/Tom.html |date=April 23, 2005 }}.</ref>\n\n''[[Santa Claus: A Morality]]'' was probably Cummings' most successful play. It is an allegorical Christmas fantasy presented in one act of five scenes. The play was inspired by his daughter Nancy, with whom he was reunited in 1946. It was first published in the Harvard College magazine, ''Wake''. The play's main characters are Santa Claus, his family (Woman and Child), Death, and Mob. At the outset of the play, Santa Claus' family has disintegrated due to their lust for knowledge (Science). After a series of events, however, Santa Claus' faith in love and his rejection of the materialism and disappointment he associates with Science are reaffirmed, and he is reunited with Woman and Child.\n\n===Name and capitalization===\nCummings' publishers and others have often echoed the unconventional [[orthography]] in his poetry by writing his name in lowercase and without periods ([[full stop]]s), but normal orthography for his name (uppercase and periods) is supported by scholarship and preferred by publishers today.<ref name=\"friedman92\" /> Cummings himself used both the lowercase and capitalized versions, though he most often signed his name with capitals.<ref name=\"friedman92\">{{cite journal | last = Friedman | first =  Norman | year = 1992 | title = Not \"e. e. cummings\" | journal=Spring | volume = 1 | pages = 114\u201321 | url = http://faculty.gvsu.edu/websterm/cummings/caps.htm | accessdate = December 13, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nThe use of lowercase for his initials was popularized in part by the title of some books, particularly in the 1960s, printing his name in lower case on the cover and spine. In the preface to ''E. E. Cummings: The Growth of a Writer'' by Norman Friedman, critic Harry T. Moore notes Cummings \"had his name put legally into lower case, and in his later books the titles and his name were always in lower case.\"<ref>{{cite book | last = Friedman | first = Norman | title = E.

Moore to make such a stupid & childish statement about Cummings & his signature.\" On February 27, 1951, Cummings wrote to his French translator D. Jon Grossman that he preferred the use of upper case for the particular edition they were working on.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Friedman | first = Norman | year = 1995 | title = Not \"e. e. cummings\" Revisited | journal=Spring | volume = 5 | pages = 41\u201343 | url = http://faculty.gvsu.edu/websterm/cummings/caps2.html | accessdate = May 12, 2007 }}</ref> One Cummings scholar believes that on the rare occasions that Cummings signed his name in all lowercase, he may have intended it as a gesture of humility, not as an indication that it was the preferred orthography for others to use.<ref name=\"friedman92\" /> Additionally, the ''Chicago Manual of Style'', which prescribes favoring non-standard capitalization of names in accordance with the bearer's strongly stated preference, notes \"E. E. Cummings can be safely capitalized; it was one of his publishers, not he himself, who lowercased his name.\"<ref name=\"chicago84\">{{cite book |publisher=Chicago University Press|year=2010|title=Chicago Manual of Style|edition=16|section=Capitalization of Personal Names|page=388}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\nIn 1943, modern dancer and choreographer [[Jean Erdman]] presented \"The Transformations of Medusa, Forever and Sunsmell\" with a commissioned score by [[John Cage]] and a spoken text from the title poem by E. E. Cummings, sponsored by the [[Arts Club of Chicago]]. Erdman also choreographed \"Twenty Poems\" (1960), a cycle of E. E. Cummings' poems for eight dancers and one actor, with a commissioned score by [[Teiji Ito]]. It was performed in the round at the [[Circle in the Square Theatre]] in Greenwich Village.\n\nNumerous composers have set Cummings' poems to music:\n* In 1961, [[Pierre Boulez]] composed \"Cummings ist der dichter\" from poems by E. E. Cummings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://brahms.ircam.fr/works/work/6957/|title=cummings ist der dichter, Pierre Boulez}}</ref>\n* [[Aribert Reimann]] set Cummings to music in \"Impression IV\" (1961) for soprano and piano.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2743128|title=Impression IV : nach einem Gedicht von E.E.

On her next album, ''[[Med\u00falla]]'' (2004), Bj\u00f6rk used his poem \"It May Not Always Be So\" as the lyrics for the song \"Sonnets/Unrealities XI.\"\n* The American composer [[Eric Whitacre]] wrote a [[Eric Whitacre#SATB choral|cycle of works]] for choir titled ''The City and the Sea'', which consists of five poems by Cummings set to music.\n* Others who have composed settings for his poems include [[Dominic Argento]], [[William Bergsma]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Marc Blitzstein]], [[John Cage]], [[Romeo Cascarino]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Serge de Gastyne]], [[David Diamond (composer)|David Diamond]], [[John Woods Duke|John Duke]], [[Margaret Garwood]], [[Daron Hagen]], [[Michael Hedges]], [[Richard Hundley]], [[Barbara Kolb]], [[Leonard Lehrman]], [[Robert Manno]], [[Salvatore Martirano]], [[William Mayer (composer)|William Mayer]], [[John Musto]], [[Paul Nordoff]], [[Tobias Picker]], [[Vincent Persichetti]], [[Ned Rorem]], [[Peter Schickele]], [[Elie Siegmeister]], [[Aki Takase]], [[Hugo Weisgall]], [[Dan Welcher]], and [[James Yannatos]], among many others.<ref name=\"lieder\">{{citation |title = Author: E.

He wrote approximately 2,900 poems, two autobiographical novels, four plays, and several essays. He is often regarded as one of the most important American poets of the 20th century.\nCummings is associated with [[Modernist literature|modernist]] [[free verse|free-form poetry]]. Much of his work has idiosyncratic syntax and uses lower case spellings for poetic expression. His use of lower case extended to rendering even the personal pronoun ''I'' as ''i'', as in the phrase \"i shall go.\u201d\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early years===\nEdward Estlin Cummings was born on October 14, 1894 in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] to Edward Cummings and the former Rebecca Haswell Clarke, a well-known [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] couple in the city. His father was a professor at Harvard University who later became nationally known as the minister of South Congregational Church (Unitarian) in Boston, Massachusetts.<ref>Collins, Leo W. ''This is Our Church''. Boston, Massachusetts: Society of the First Church in Boston, 2005: 104.</ref> His mother, who loved to spend time with her children, played games with Cummings and his sister, Elizabeth. From an early age, Cummings' parents supported his creative gifts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/cummings/cummings_life.htm|title=E. E. Cummings' Life|website=english.illinois.edu|access-date=27 April 2016}}</ref> Cummings wrote poems and drew as a child, and he often played outdoors with the many other children who lived in his neighborhood. He grew up in the company of such family friends as the philosophers [[William James]] and [[Josiah Royce]]. Many of Cummings' summers were spent on [[Silver Lake (Madison, New Hampshire)|Silver Lake]] in [[Madison, New Hampshire]], where his father had built two houses along the eastern shore. The family ultimately purchased the nearby [[Joy Farm]] where Cummings had his primary summer residence.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wpkDRPueLiMC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=E.E.

As he matured, Cummings moved to an [[I and Thou|\"I, Thou\"]] relationship with God. His journals are replete with references to ''\"le bon Dieu\"'', as well as prayers for inspiration in his poetry and artwork (such as \"Bon Dieu! may i some day do something truly great. amen.\"). Cummings \"also prayed for strength to be his essential self ('may I be I is the only prayer\u2014not may I be great or good or beautiful or wise or strong'), and for relief of spirit in times of depression ('almighty God! I thank thee for my soul; & may I never die spiritually into a mere mind through disease of loneliness').\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/unitarians/cummings.html |title=E.

On the boat to France, he met [[William Slater Brown]] and they would become friends. Due to an administrative error, Cummings and Brown did not receive an assignment for five weeks, a period they spent exploring Paris. Cummings fell in love with the city, to which he would return throughout his life.<ref name=utexas>{{cite web|url=http://research.hrc.utexas.edu:8080/hrcxtf/view?docId=ead/00030.xml|title=E. E.

They were known to prefer the company of French soldiers over fellow ambulance drivers. The two openly expressed anti-war views; Cummings spoke of his lack of hatred for the Germans.<ref>Friedman, Norman \"Cummings, E[dward] E[stlin]\", in Steven Serafin, ''The Continuum Encyclopedia of American Literature'', 2003, Continuum, p. 244.</ref> On September 21, 1917, five months after starting his belated assignment, Cummings and William Slater Brown were arrested by the French military on suspicion of espionage and undesirable activities. They were held for three and a half months in a military detention camp at the ''[[La Fert\u00e9-Mac\u00e9|D\u00e9p\u00f4t de Triage]]'', in [[La Fert\u00e9-Mac\u00e9]], Orne, Normandy.<ref name=utexas/>\n\nThey were imprisoned with other detainees in a large room. Cummings' father failed to obtain his son's release through diplomatic channels, and in December 1917 he wrote a letter to President [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Cummings was released on December 19, 1917, and Brown was released two months later. Cummings used his prison experience as the basis for his novel, ''[[The Enormous Room]]'' (1922), about which [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] said, \"Of all the work by young men who have sprung up since 1920 one book survives\u2014''The Enormous Room'' by e e cummings... Those few who cause books to live have not been able to endure the thought of its mortality.\"<ref>Bloom, p. 1814.</ref> <!-- Did F Scott Fitzgerald use upper- or lower-case for Cummings' name?  In a direct quote, it matters. -->\n\nCummings returned to the United States on New Year's Day 1918. Later in 1918 he was drafted into the army. He served in the [[12th Division (United States)|12th Division]] at [[Camp Devens|Camp Devens, Massachusetts]], until November 1918.<ref>Kennedy, p. 186.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.military.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~worldwarone/WWI/divisions.html#Twelfth|title=Data on U.S. Army Divisions during World War I, WWI, The Great War}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote box |width=300px |align=right ||salign=right\n |quote  =<poem>\nBuffalo Bill's\ndefunct\n        who used to\n        ride a watersmooth-silver\n                                  stallion\nand break onetwothreefourfive pigeonsjustlikethat\n                                                  Jesus\n\nhe was a handsome man\n                      and what i want to know is\nhow do you like your blueeyed boy\nMister Death\n</poem>\n |source =\"Buffalo Bill's\" (1920)}}\n\n===Post-war years===\nCummings returned to Paris in 1921 and lived there for two years before returning to New York. His collection ''Tulips and Chimneys'' was published in 1923 and his inventive use of grammar and syntax is evident. The book was heavily cut by his editor. ''XLI Poems'' was published in 1925. With these collections, Cummings made his reputation as an avant garde poet.<ref Name=\"PoetryF\"/>\n\nDuring the rest of the 1920s and 1930s, Cummings returned to Paris a number of times, and traveled throughout Europe, meeting, among others, artist [[Pablo Picasso]]. In 1931 Cummings traveled to the [[Soviet Union]], recounting his experiences in ''[[Eimi (book)|Eimi]]'', published two years later. During these years Cummings also traveled to Northern Africa and [[Mexico]]. He worked as an essayist and portrait artist for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine (1924\u20131927).\n\nIn 1926, Cummings' parents were in a car crash; only his mother survived, although she was severely injured. Cummings later described the crash in the following passage from his ''i: six nonlectures'' series given at Harvard (as part of the [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]]) in 1952 and 1953:\n\n<blockquote>\nA locomotive cut the car in half, killing my father instantly. When two brakemen jumped from the halted train, they saw a woman standing \u2013 dazed but erect \u2013 beside a mangled machine; with blood spouting (as the older said to me) out of her head. One of her hands (the younger added) kept feeling her dress, as if trying to discover why it was wet. These men took my sixty-six-year old mother by the arms and tried to lead her toward a nearby farmhouse; but she threw them off, strode straight to my father's body, and directed a group of scared spectators to cover him. When this had been done (and only then) she let them lead her away.\n</blockquote>\n\nHis father's death had a profound effect on Cummings, who entered a new period in his artistic life. He began to focus on more important aspects of life in his poetry. He started this new period by paying homage to his father in the poem \"my father moved through dooms of love\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~richie/poetry/html/aupoem114.html |title=My father moved through dooms of love |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050315070117/http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~richie/poetry/html/aupoem114.html |archivedate=March 15, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | first = Gary | last = Lane | authorlink =  | year = 1976 | title = I Am: A Study of E.

His longest relationship lasted more than three decades, a [[common-law marriage]] to Marion Morehouse.\n\nCummings' first marriage, to Elaine Orr, began as a love affair in 1918 while she was still married to [[Scofield Thayer]], one of Cummings' friends from Harvard. During this time he wrote a good deal of his erotic poetry.<ref name=\"Kennedy\">''Selected Poems,'' Ed. Richard S. Kennedy, Liveright, 1994.</ref> After divorcing Thayer, Orr married Cummings on March 19, 1924. The couple had a daughter together out of wedlock. However, the couple separated after two months of marriage and divorced less than nine months later.\n\nCummings married his second wife Anne Minnerly Barton on May 1, 1929, and they separated three years later in 1932. That same year, Minnerly obtained a [[Mexican divorce]]; it was not officially recognized in the United States until August 1934. Anne died in 1970 aged 72.\n\nIn 1934, after his separation from his second wife, Cummings met Marion Morehouse, a fashion model and photographer. Although it is not clear whether the two were ever formally married, Morehouse lived with Cummings in a common-law marriage until his death in 1962. She died on May 18, 1969,<ref>''Marion Morehouse Cummings, Poet's Widow, Top Model, Dies'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 19, 1969.</ref> while living at 4 [[Patchin Place]], [[Greenwich Village]], New York City, where Cummings had resided since September 1924.<ref>Sawyer-Lau\u00e7anno, p. 255.</ref>\n\n===Political views===\nAccording to his testimony in ''[[Eimi (book)|EIMI]]'', Cummings had little interest in politics until his trip to the Soviet Union in 1931.<ref name=Blumenkranz>Carla Blumenkranz, [http://www.poetryfoundation.org/article/180437 \"The Enormous Poem: When E.E.

'Republic of Dreams: Greenwich Village: The American Bohemia, 1910\u20131960', pp. 449 [https://books.google.com/books?id=o2DB77ccf9sC&pg=PA449 Google Books]</ref>\n\n==Work==\n\n===Poetry===\nDespite Cummings' familiarity with [[avant-garde]] styles (likely affected by the ''[[Calligrammes]]'' of French poet [[Apollinaire]], according to a contemporary observation<ref>Taupin, Rene, ''The Influence of French Symbolism on Modern American Poetry 1927'' (Trans. William Pratt), AMS Inc, New York 1985  {{ISBN|0404615791}}</ref>), much of his work is quite traditional. Many of his poems are [[sonnet]]s, albeit often with a modern twist. He occasionally used the [[blues#Lyrics|blues]] form and [[acrostics]]. Cummings' poetry often deals with themes of love and nature, as well as the relationship of the individual to the masses and to the world. His poems are also often rife with satire.\n\nWhile his poetic forms and themes share an affinity with the [[Romanticism|Romantic tradition]], Cummings' work universally shows a particular idiosyncrasy of [[syntax]], or way of arranging individual words into larger phrases and sentences. Many of his most striking poems do not involve any typographical or punctuation innovations at all, but purely syntactic ones.\n\n<!---NB **The typography is Cummings' original setting**--->\n{{Quote box |width=350px |align=right ||salign=right\n |quote  =<poem>\ni carry your heart with me(i carry it in\nmy heart)i am never without it(anywhere\ni go you go,my dear;and whatever is done\nby only me is your doing,my darling)\n                                            i fear\nno fate(for you are my fate,my sweet)i want\nno world(for beautiful you are my world,my true)\nand it's you are whatever a moon has always meant\nand whatever a sun will always sing is you\n\nhere is the deepest secret nobody knows\n(here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud\nand the sky of the sky of a tree called life;which grows\nhigher than soul can hope or mind can hide)\nand this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart\n\ni carry your heart(i carry it in my heart)\n</poem>\n |source =From \"i carry your heart with me(i carry it in\" (1952)<ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/179622 \"i carry your heart with me(i carry it in\"] at the Poetry Foundation.</ref>}}\n\nAs well as being influenced by notable [[Modernist literature|modernists]], including [[Gertrude Stein]] and [[Ezra Pound]], Cummings in his early work drew upon the [[Imagism|imagist]] experiments of [[Amy Lowell]]. Later, his visits to Paris exposed him to [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]], which he reflected in his work. He began to rely on symbolism and allegory, where he once had used simile and metaphor. In his later work, he rarely used comparisons that required objects that were not previously mentioned in the poem, choosing to use a symbol instead. Due to this, his later poetry is \"frequently more lucid, more moving, and more profound than his earlier.\"<ref>Friedman, Norman. ''E. E. Cummings the Art of His Poetry.'' Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 1967. p. 89.</ref> Cummings also liked to incorporate imagery of nature and death into much of his poetry.\n\nWhile some of his poetry is [[free verse]] (with no concern for [[rhyme]] or [[meter (poetry)|meter]]), many have a recognizable sonnet structure of 14 lines, with an intricate rhyme scheme. A number of his poems feature a typographically exuberant style, with words, parts of words, or punctuation symbols scattered across the page, often making little sense until read aloud, at which point the meaning and emotion become clear. Cummings, who was also a painter, understood the importance of presentation, and used typography to \"paint a picture\" with some of his poems.<ref>{{cite journal | first = Iain | last = Landles | authorlink = Iain Landles | year = 2001 | title = An Analysis of Two Poems by E. E. Cummings | journal=SPRING, the Journal of the E. E. Cummings Society | volume = 10 | pages = 31\u201343 }}</ref>\n\nThe seeds of Cummings' unconventional style appear well established even in his earliest work. At age six, he wrote to his father:\n\n<blockquote><small>FATHER DEAR. BE, YOUR FATHER-GOOD AND GOOD,<br>\nHE IS GOOD NOW, IT IS NOT GOOD TO SEE IT RAIN,<br>\nFATHER DEAR IS, IT, DEAR, NO FATHER DEAR,<br>\nLOVE, YOU DEAR,<br>\nESTLIN.</small><ref>''Selected letters of E. E. Cummings'', (1972) Edward Estlin Cummings, Frederick Wilcox Dupee, George Stade. University of Michigan p. 3 {{ISBN|978-0-233-95637-4}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nFollowing his autobiographical novel, ''[[The Enormous Room]]'', Cummings' first published work was a collection of poems titled ''[[Tulips and Chimneys]]'' (1923). This work was the public's first encounter with his characteristic eccentric use of grammar and punctuation.\n\nSome of Cummings' most famous poems do not involve much, if any, odd typography or punctuation, but still carry his unmistakable style, particularly in unusual and impressionistic word order.\n\n{{Quote box |width=300px |align=right ||salign=right\n |quote  =<poem>\nanyone lived in a pretty how town\n(with up so floating many bells down)\nspring summer autumn winter\nhe sang his didn't he danced his did\n\nWomen and men (both little and small)\ncared for anyone not at all\nthey sowed their isn't they reaped their same\nsun moon stars rain\n</poem>\n |source =From \"[[anyone lived in a pretty how town]]\" (1940)<ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/11856 \"anyone lived in a pretty how town\" at the Poetry Foundation]</ref>}}\n\nCummings' work often does not proceed in accordance with the conventional combinatorial rules that generate typical English sentences (for example, \"they sowed their isn't\"). In addition, a number of Cummings' poems feature, in part or in whole, intentional misspellings, and several incorporate phonetic spellings intended to represent particular dialects. Cummings also made use of inventive formations of compound words, as in \"in Just\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/images/modeng/public/Cum2Dia/CumDi580.jpg |title=in Just}}</ref> which features words such as \"mud-luscious\", \"puddle-wonderful\", and \"eddieandbill.\" This poem is part of a sequence of poems titled ''Chansons Innocentes'';<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15398 |title=''Chansons Innocentes'' |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227115128/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15398 |archive-date=December 27, 2005 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> it has many references comparing the \"balloonman\" to [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], the mythical creature that is half-goat and half-man. Literary critic [[R.P.

''E. E. Cummings the Art of His Poetry''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1967. pp. 61\u201362.</ref>\n\nFellow poet [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]], in her equivocal letter recommending Cummings for the [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] he was awarded in 1934, expressed her frustration at his opaque symbolism. \"[I]f he prints and offers for sale poetry which he is quite content should be, after hours of sweating concentration, inexplicable from any point of view to a person as intelligent as myself, then he does so with a motive which is frivolous from the point of view of art, and should not be helped or encouraged by any serious person or group of persons... there is fine writing and powerful writing (as well as some of the most pompous nonsense I ever let slip to the floor with a wide yawn)... What I propose, then, is this: that you give Mr. Cummings enough rope. He may hang himself; or he may lasso a unicorn.\"<ref>Millay to Mr. Moe of the Guggenheim Foundation, March 1934. Quoted in Milford, Nancy (2001) ''Savage Beauty: The Life of Edna St. Vincent Millay'', Doubleday: New York, NY. p370.</ref>\n\nMany of Cummings' poems are satirical and address social issues<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15404 |title=why must itself up every of a park |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813233241/http://poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15404 |archive-date=August 13, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> but have an equal or even stronger bias toward romanticism: time and again his poems celebrate love, sex, and the season of rebirth.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15403 |title=anyone lived in a pretty how town |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726121247/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15403 |archive-date=July 26, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nCummings also wrote children's books and novels. A notable example of his versatility is an introduction he wrote for a collection of the comic strip ''[[Krazy Kat]]''.\n\n===Controversy===\nCummings is known for controversial subject matter, as he wrote numerous erotic poems. He also sometimes included ethnic slurs in his writing.

All the fuss perplexed him. The poems were commenting on prejudice, he pointed out, and not condoning it. He intended to show how derogatory words cause people to see others in terms of stereotypes rather than as individuals. \"America (which turns Hungarian into 'hunky' & Irishman into 'mick' and Norwegian into 'square- head') is to blame for 'kike,'\" he said.<ref Name=\"Reef\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[William Carlos Williams]] spoke out in his defense.<ref Name=\"Reef\">''E. Cummings'' (2006) by Catherine Reef, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt p. 115 {{ISBN|978-0-618-56849-9}}</ref>{{Clarify|reason=|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Plays===\nDuring his lifetime, Cummings published four plays. ''HIM'', a three-act play, was first produced in 1928 by the [[Provincetown Players]] in New York City. The production was directed by James Light. The play's main characters are \"Him\", a playwright, portrayed by [[William Johnstone (actor)|William Johnstone]], and \"Me\", his girlfriend, portrayed by [[Erin O'Brien-Moore]].\n\nCummings said of the unorthodox play:\n<blockquote>Relax and give the play a chance to strut its stuff\u2014relax, stop wondering what it is all 'about'\u2014like many strange and familiar things, Life included, this play isn't 'about,' it simply is. . . . Don't try to enjoy it, let it try to enjoy you. <small>DON'T TRY TO UNDERSTAND IT, LET IT TRY TO UNDERSTAND YOU.</small>\"<ref>Kennedy, p. 295.</ref></blockquote>\n\n''Anthropos, or the Future of Art'' is a short, one-act play that Cummings contributed to the anthology ''Whither, Whither or After Sex, What? A Symposium to End Symposium''. The play consists of dialogue between Man, the main character, and three \"infrahumans\", or inferior beings. The word ''[[Greek language|anthropos]]'' is the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for \"man\", in the sense of \"mankind\".\n\n''Tom, A Ballet'' is a ballet based on ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''. The ballet is detailed in a \"synopsis\" as well as descriptions of four \"episodes\", which were published by Cummings in 1935. It has never been performed.<ref>[http://www.gvsu.edu/english/cummings/Tom.html GVSU.edu The E. E. Cummings Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050423191607/http://www.gvsu.edu/english/cummings/Tom.html |date=April 23, 2005 }}.</ref>\n\n''[[Santa Claus: A Morality]]'' was probably Cummings' most successful play. It is an allegorical Christmas fantasy presented in one act of five scenes. The play was inspired by his daughter Nancy, with whom he was reunited in 1946. It was first published in the Harvard College magazine, ''Wake''. The play's main characters are Santa Claus, his family (Woman and Child), Death, and Mob. At the outset of the play, Santa Claus' family has disintegrated due to their lust for knowledge (Science). After a series of events, however, Santa Claus' faith in love and his rejection of the materialism and disappointment he associates with Science are reaffirmed, and he is reunited with Woman and Child.\n\n===Name and capitalization===\nCummings' publishers and others have often echoed the unconventional [[orthography]] in his poetry by writing his name in lowercase and without periods ([[full stop]]s), but normal orthography for his name (uppercase and periods) is supported by scholarship and preferred by publishers today.<ref name=\"friedman92\" /> Cummings himself used both the lowercase and capitalized versions, though he most often signed his name with capitals.<ref name=\"friedman92\">{{cite journal | last = Friedman | first =  Norman | year = 1992 | title = Not \"e. e. cummings\" | journal=Spring | volume = 1 | pages = 114\u201321 | url = http://faculty.gvsu.edu/websterm/cummings/caps.htm | accessdate = December 13, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nThe use of lowercase for his initials was popularized in part by the title of some books, particularly in the 1960s, printing his name in lower case on the cover and spine. In the preface to ''E. E. Cummings: The Growth of a Writer'' by Norman Friedman, critic Harry T. Moore notes Cummings \"had his name put legally into lower case, and in his later books the titles and his name were always in lower case.\"<ref>{{cite book | last = Friedman | first = Norman | title = E.

Moore to make such a stupid & childish statement about Cummings & his signature.\" On February 27, 1951, Cummings wrote to his French translator D. Jon Grossman that he preferred the use of upper case for the particular edition they were working on.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Friedman | first = Norman | year = 1995 | title = Not \"e. e. cummings\" Revisited | journal=Spring | volume = 5 | pages = 41\u201343 | url = http://faculty.gvsu.edu/websterm/cummings/caps2.html | accessdate = May 12, 2007 }}</ref> One Cummings scholar believes that on the rare occasions that Cummings signed his name in all lowercase, he may have intended it as a gesture of humility, not as an indication that it was the preferred orthography for others to use.<ref name=\"friedman92\" /> Additionally, the ''Chicago Manual of Style'', which prescribes favoring non-standard capitalization of names in accordance with the bearer's strongly stated preference, notes \"E. E. Cummings can be safely capitalized; it was one of his publishers, not he himself, who lowercased his name.\"<ref name=\"chicago84\">{{cite book |publisher=Chicago University Press|year=2010|title=Chicago Manual of Style|edition=16|section=Capitalization of Personal Names|page=388}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\nIn 1943, modern dancer and choreographer [[Jean Erdman]] presented \"The Transformations of Medusa, Forever and Sunsmell\" with a commissioned score by [[John Cage]] and a spoken text from the title poem by E. E. Cummings, sponsored by the [[Arts Club of Chicago]]. Erdman also choreographed \"Twenty Poems\" (1960), a cycle of E. E. Cummings' poems for eight dancers and one actor, with a commissioned score by [[Teiji Ito]]. It was performed in the round at the [[Circle in the Square Theatre]] in Greenwich Village.\n\nNumerous composers have set Cummings' poems to music:\n* In 1961, [[Pierre Boulez]] composed \"Cummings ist der dichter\" from poems by E. E. Cummings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://brahms.ircam.fr/works/work/6957/|title=cummings ist der dichter, Pierre Boulez}}</ref>\n* [[Aribert Reimann]] set Cummings to music in \"Impression IV\" (1961) for soprano and piano.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2743128|title=Impression IV : nach einem Gedicht von E.E.

On her next album, ''[[Med\u00falla]]'' (2004), Bj\u00f6rk used his poem \"It May Not Always Be So\" as the lyrics for the song \"Sonnets/Unrealities XI.\"\n* The American composer [[Eric Whitacre]] wrote a [[Eric Whitacre#SATB choral|cycle of works]] for choir titled ''The City and the Sea'', which consists of five poems by Cummings set to music.\n* Others who have composed settings for his poems include [[Dominic Argento]], [[William Bergsma]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Marc Blitzstein]], [[John Cage]], [[Romeo Cascarino]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Serge de Gastyne]], [[David Diamond (composer)|David Diamond]], [[John Woods Duke|John Duke]], [[Margaret Garwood]], [[Daron Hagen]], [[Michael Hedges]], [[Richard Hundley]], [[Barbara Kolb]], [[Leonard Lehrman]], [[Robert Manno]], [[Salvatore Martirano]], [[William Mayer (composer)|William Mayer]], [[John Musto]], [[Paul Nordoff]], [[Tobias Picker]], [[Vincent Persichetti]], [[Ned Rorem]], [[Peter Schickele]], [[Elie Siegmeister]], [[Aki Takase]], [[Hugo Weisgall]], [[Dan Welcher]], and [[James Yannatos]], among many others.<ref name=\"lieder\">{{citation |title = Author: E.

The game was developed by [[Human Entertainment]] and originally released in Japan on July 30, 1998. It was published in North America by [[Working Designs]].\n\n''Vanguard Bandits'' is a support-centric strategy RPG featuring tactical combat in a medieval fantasy world in which [[knight]]s and [[soldiers]] pilot ''[[mecha]]''. This game takes place on the Continent of Eptina where numerous battles have taken place over territory, goods, and beliefs. In the midst of the conflict archaeologists in the Pharastia Kingdom discovered giant armored [[mecha]] that they called ATACs, or All Terrain Armored Combatants, that could be controlled by the thoughts of the pilot seated inside the unit's head. The Kingdom used the power of these ATACs to assume control of the entire continent, and then decided to use them to keep the peace in their new territories. ''Pharastia'' soon began to lose control as [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|Coup d'etats]] and civil wars erupted which left it in a defeated state, with only their standing army remaining.\n\n==Gameplay==\nVanguard Bandits is an RPG strategy game played on an [[isometric projection|isometric]] grid of squares with representations of all the player and computer controlled ATACs, similar to [[Final Fantasy Tactics]] and the [[Front Mission]] series by Square. Each character can move around on the grid, attack, and perform support abilities. All actions during that ATACs turn takes up AP (Actions Points), and attacks produce FP (Fatigue Points). If the Fatigue Points reach maximum, the pilot becomes unable to perform any actions until he/she awakens, leaving him/her open to attack. When an ATAC unit attacks or defends from an attack, a detailed [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] battle animation with music is shown over the normal grid. Between each battle is a story cutscene where the characters within the ATACs are represented on a similar grid and can interact and further the story line.\n\nThe player progresses through a total of 20 missions in one of three different story lines. Different battles and events happen based on the choices of the character within certain story scenes between battles, a character's level, or the morale of the group. Notably, if Bastion reaches a high enough level by the end of the third mission, he will be faced with the choice of whether to remain with his companions on the Kingdom branch or to chase after the game's villain, ultimately reaching the Empire branch. Each of these branches has two endings, the Kingdom branch depending on the overall morale of the characters and the Empire branch depending on Bastion's relationship with two female characters. And players who have beaten the game once are given the option of switching from the Kingdom branch to the whimsical, pessimistic, non-serious Ruin branch.\n\n===Combat===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:VanguardBandits combat.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A battle scene in ''Vanguard Bandits''.]] -->\nEach ATAC has a number of attacks available to it, depending on its weapon and gemstone; many major characters also have one (or more) special attacks not available to other characters in the game. Each attack deals a different amount on damage and has a different chance of hitting the target (affected, of course, by the character's own stats). Most attacks can only be made on adjacent squares; some can hit enemies further away, the Turbulence attack in particular having a range of four squares. Attacks from the side and rear have higher success rates and leave the defender fewer options; thus, [[flanking]] is a vital strategy in Vanguard Bandits.\n\nAttacks can be classified into three types:\n* '''Normal:''' Standard attack. Most attacks fall into this category.\n* '''Knockdown:''' If the attack succeeds, the defender is knocked down and thus unable to respond with a counterattack. Selecting the ''Defend'' option (explained below) prevents the defending ATAC from falling over.\n* '''Collision:''' Used only by particularly heavy attacks, Collision rams the defending ATAC full force, always toppling it unless the attack is evaded or parried.\nAdditionally, some attacks can cause temporary negative status effects on the victim, such as reduced speed or attack power.\n\nWhen attacked, the defending ATAC has several options:\n* '''Attack:''' Once the attacker has carried out their attack, the defender responds with an attack of their own. While this can cause significant damage, it also costs high FP (all AP costs are converted to FP for the purpose of counterattacking). Additionally, the counterattack will be canceled if the attacker uses a successful Knockdown or Collision attack. Cannot be used against rear attacks.\n* '''Defend:''' The defender braces themselves and takes defensive maneuvers, thus reducing the damage received. Costs 30 FP and cannot be used against rear attacks.\n* '''Avoid:''' The defender attempts to avoid the attack, thus preventing any damage. This is the only move that can be performed against rear attacks, and costs 20 FP.\n* '''Counter:''' The defender preempts the enemy attack, thus doing damage while protecting oneself from harm. However, if it fails the defender receives more damage. Can only be used against frontal attacks and costs 20 FP.\nIf the defending character has the appropriate skill, some enemy attacks can also be [[Parry (fencing)|parried]], resulting in no damage to the defender.\n\nAs well as attacks designed to inflict damage, players can also use special abilities which assist friendly ATACs, such as increasing a stat, recovering HP or reducing FP. One skill, Turn Quake, is designed to be used on enemies; it rotates them in a random direction.\n\nTerrain plays an important role in the game. Moving across difficult terrain such as forests and deserts requires more AP than normal, although not all ATACs suffer equally from this effect (some not at all). Some terrain is completely impassable.\n\n==The ATACs==\nAll-Terrain Armored Combatants, or ATACs, are the main fighting force of the various armies in the game; the entire combat system revolves around them. They are large [[biped]]al, [[humanoid]] (though one ATAC is a [[quadruped]]) [[mech]]s powered by [[gemstone]]s. Despite their high technological complexity, ATACs still utilize traditional weapons such as [[sword]]s and [[spear]]s. However, they can also use special attacks such as fireballs, earthquakes, flying shards of ice and tornadoes, depending on their gemstone.\n\nATACs that existed before the game takes place are called \"Excavated ATACs\". These were built by Eptina's original inhabitants and were discovered by archaeologists of the continent's current settlers.

The game was developed by [[Human Entertainment]] and originally released in Japan on July 30, 1998. It was published in North America by [[Working Designs]].\n\n''Vanguard Bandits'' is a support-centric strategy RPG featuring tactical combat in a medieval fantasy world in which [[knight]]s and [[soldiers]] pilot ''[[mecha]]''. This game takes place on the Continent of Eptina where numerous battles have taken place over territory, goods, and beliefs. In the midst of the conflict archaeologists in the Pharastia Kingdom discovered giant armored [[mecha]] that they called ATACs, or All Terrain Armored Combatants, that could be controlled by the thoughts of the pilot seated inside the unit's head. The Kingdom used the power of these ATACs to assume control of the entire continent, and then decided to use them to keep the peace in their new territories. ''Pharastia'' soon began to lose control as [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|Coup d'etats]] and civil wars erupted which left it in a defeated state, with only their standing army remaining.\n\n==Gameplay==\nVanguard Bandits is an RPG strategy game played on an [[isometric projection|isometric]] grid of squares with representations of all the player and computer controlled ATACs, similar to [[Final Fantasy Tactics]] and the [[Front Mission]] series by Square. Each character can move around on the grid, attack, and perform support abilities. All actions during that ATACs turn takes up AP (Actions Points), and attacks produce FP (Fatigue Points). If the Fatigue Points reach maximum, the pilot becomes unable to perform any actions until he/she awakens, leaving him/her open to attack. When an ATAC unit attacks or defends from an attack, a detailed [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] battle animation with music is shown over the normal grid. Between each battle is a story cutscene where the characters within the ATACs are represented on a similar grid and can interact and further the story line.\n\nThe player progresses through a total of 20 missions in one of three different story lines. Different battles and events happen based on the choices of the character within certain story scenes between battles, a character's level, or the morale of the group. Notably, if Bastion reaches a high enough level by the end of the third mission, he will be faced with the choice of whether to remain with his companions on the Kingdom branch or to chase after the game's villain, ultimately reaching the Empire branch. Each of these branches has two endings, the Kingdom branch depending on the overall morale of the characters and the Empire branch depending on Bastion's relationship with two female characters. And players who have beaten the game once are given the option of switching from the Kingdom branch to the whimsical, pessimistic, non-serious Ruin branch.\n\n===Combat===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:VanguardBandits combat.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A battle scene in ''Vanguard Bandits''.]] -->\nEach ATAC has a number of attacks available to it, depending on its weapon and gemstone; many major characters also have one (or more) special attacks not available to other characters in the game. Each attack deals a different amount on damage and has a different chance of hitting the target (affected, of course, by the character's own stats). Most attacks can only be made on adjacent squares; some can hit enemies further away, the Turbulence attack in particular having a range of four squares. Attacks from the side and rear have higher success rates and leave the defender fewer options; thus, [[flanking]] is a vital strategy in Vanguard Bandits.\n\nAttacks can be classified into three types:\n* '''Normal:''' Standard attack. Most attacks fall into this category.\n* '''Knockdown:''' If the attack succeeds, the defender is knocked down and thus unable to respond with a counterattack. Selecting the ''Defend'' option (explained below) prevents the defending ATAC from falling over.\n* '''Collision:''' Used only by particularly heavy attacks, Collision rams the defending ATAC full force, always toppling it unless the attack is evaded or parried.\nAdditionally, some attacks can cause temporary negative status effects on the victim, such as reduced speed or attack power.\n\nWhen attacked, the defending ATAC has several options:\n* '''Attack:''' Once the attacker has carried out their attack, the defender responds with an attack of their own. While this can cause significant damage, it also costs high FP (all AP costs are converted to FP for the purpose of counterattacking). Additionally, the counterattack will be canceled if the attacker uses a successful Knockdown or Collision attack. Cannot be used against rear attacks.\n* '''Defend:''' The defender braces themselves and takes defensive maneuvers, thus reducing the damage received. Costs 30 FP and cannot be used against rear attacks.\n* '''Avoid:''' The defender attempts to avoid the attack, thus preventing any damage. This is the only move that can be performed against rear attacks, and costs 20 FP.\n* '''Counter:''' The defender preempts the enemy attack, thus doing damage while protecting oneself from harm. However, if it fails the defender receives more damage. Can only be used against frontal attacks and costs 20 FP.\nIf the defending character has the appropriate skill, some enemy attacks can also be [[Parry (fencing)|parried]], resulting in no damage to the defender.\n\nAs well as attacks designed to inflict damage, players can also use special abilities which assist friendly ATACs, such as increasing a stat, recovering HP or reducing FP. One skill, Turn Quake, is designed to be used on enemies; it rotates them in a random direction.\n\nTerrain plays an important role in the game. Moving across difficult terrain such as forests and deserts requires more AP than normal, although not all ATACs suffer equally from this effect (some not at all). Some terrain is completely impassable.\n\n==The ATACs==\nAll-Terrain Armored Combatants, or ATACs, are the main fighting force of the various armies in the game; the entire combat system revolves around them. They are large [[biped]]al, [[humanoid]] (though one ATAC is a [[quadruped]]) [[mech]]s powered by [[gemstone]]s. Despite their high technological complexity, ATACs still utilize traditional weapons such as [[sword]]s and [[spear]]s. However, they can also use special attacks such as fireballs, earthquakes, flying shards of ice and tornadoes, depending on their gemstone.\n\nATACs that existed before the game takes place are called \"Excavated ATACs\". These were built by Eptina's original inhabitants and were discovered by archaeologists of the continent's current settlers. These machines became the basis for modern ATACs though none created since have surpassed an Excavated ATAC on the combat field. Each ruler of Eptina possesses an Excavated ATAC.\n\n==Development==\nPrior to its North American release, ''Vanguard Bandits'' was titled ''Detonator Gauntlet'' by Working Designs.

{"title_page": "List of airports in Missouri", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nThis is a '''list of [[airport]]s in [[Missouri]]''' (a [[U.S. state]]), grouped by type and sorted by location. It contains all public-use and military airports in the state. Some private-use and former airports may be included where notable, such as airports that were previously public-use, those with commercial enplanements recorded by the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] or airports assigned an [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] airport code.\n\n==Airports==\n\n<!--  Note to editors:\n\n(1) Please do not move or remove the onlyinclude tags; they are used to transclude this state's \"Commercial Service \u2013 Primary\" airports in the [[List of airports in the United States]]. Also please do not add columns to the table since all the U.S. state lists are using the same format so that they can be transcluded into a single sortable table.\n\n(2) To compare airport use, enplanement (passenger boarding) figures are taken from a single source and are for the same year. This list currently contains the 2016 FAA enplanement data, as published in October 2017. Please do not change the enplanements for individual airports based on data from other sources. If you wish to add such information, please place it in the airport's article, not on this list.\n\n(3) Airport names shown in bold indicate the airport has scheduled passenger service on commercial airlines.

(1992). Development of concern for others. Developmental Psychology, 28, 126-136.</ref> \n\nBoth personal disposition such as [[temperament]] and social context contribute to individual differences in concern for others. Some developmental psychologists have hypothesized that empathic concern for others are essential factors inhibiting [[aggression]] toward others.<ref>Eisenberg, N., & Eggum, N.D. (2009).

Empathy and Moral Development.

(1991). Evidence for altruism: Toward a pluralism of prosocial motives. Psychological Inquiry, 2, 107-122).</ref> The challenge of demonstrating the existence of altruistic motivation is to show how empathic concern leads to helping in ways that cannot be explained by prevailing theories of egoistic motivation. That is, a clear case needs to be made that it is concern about the other person's welfare, not a desire to improve one's own welfare, that primarily drives one's helping behavior in a particular situation. \n\nEmpirical studies conducted by social psychologist [[Daniel Batson]] have demonstrated that empathic concern is felt when one adopts the perspective of another person in need. His work emphasizes the different emotions evoked when imagining another situation from a self-perspective or imagining from another perspective.<ref>Batson, C.D. (2009). Two forms of perspective taking: imagining how another feels and imagining how you would feel. In K.D. Markman, W.M.P. Klein and J.A. Suhr (Eds.), Handbook of Imagination and Mental Simulation (pp. 267-279). New York: Psychology Press.</ref> The former is often associated with [[personal distress]] (i.e., feelings of discomfort and anxiety), whereas the latter leads to empathic concern.\n\n==Social neuroscience evidence==\n\n[[Social neuroscience]] explores the biological underpinnings of empathic concern and more generally interpersonal sensitivity, using an integrative approach that bridges the biological and social levels.<ref>Decety, J., & Keenan, J.P. (2006). Social neuroscience: A new journal. Social Neuroscience, 1, 1-4.</ref> Neural systems, including autonomic functions, that rely on brain stem [[neuropeptides]], such as [[oxytocin]] and [[vasopressin]], are plausible correlates for empathic concern. Alternatively, vasopressin might be implicated in situations where a more active strategy is required for an effective response.<ref>Carter, C.S., Harris, J., & Porges, S.W. (2009). Neural and evolutionary perspectives on empathy In: J. Decety and W. Ickes, The Social Neuroscience of Empathy. Cambridge: MIT press, pp 169-182.</ref>\n\nAn association between [[executive functions]], underpinned by the [[prefrontal cortex]] with reciprocal connections with the [[limbic system]], the [[sense of agency]], and empathic concern has been suggested based on lesion studies in neurological patients and [[functional neuroimaging]] experiments in healthy individuals.<ref>Decety, J., & Jackson, P.L. (2004). The functional architecture of human empathy. Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience Reviews, 3, 71-100.</ref> \n\nThe difference between imaging self versus imaging other is supported by a series of [[functional neuroimaging]] studies of affective processing. For instance, Lamm, Batson and Decety (2007) found that participants reported more empathic concern when imagining the [[pain]] of others when adopting another perspective, and more personal [[suffering|distress]] when imagining themselves to be in pain.<ref>Lamm, C., Batson, C.D., & Decety, J. (2007). The neural substrate of human empathy: effects of perspective-taking and cognitive appraisal. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 19, 42-58.</ref> \n\nThe fMRI scans revealed that imagining self in pain was associated with strong activation in brain areas involved in affective response to threat and pain, including the amygdala, insula and anterior cingulate cortex. Imagine-other instructions produced higher activity in the right [[temporoparietal junction]] (or TPJ), which is associated with self-other distinctiveness and the sense of agency.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Affective neuroscience]]\n* [[C.

Some developmental psychologists have hypothesized that empathic concern for others are essential factors inhibiting [[aggression]] toward others.<ref>Eisenberg, N., & Eggum, N.D. (2009).

(1991). Evidence for altruism: Toward a pluralism of prosocial motives. Psychological Inquiry, 2, 107-122).</ref> The challenge of demonstrating the existence of altruistic motivation is to show how empathic concern leads to helping in ways that cannot be explained by prevailing theories of egoistic motivation. That is, a clear case needs to be made that it is concern about the other person's welfare, not a desire to improve one's own welfare, that primarily drives one's helping behavior in a particular situation. \n\nEmpirical studies conducted by social psychologist [[Daniel Batson]] have demonstrated that empathic concern is felt when one adopts the perspective of another person in need. His work emphasizes the different emotions evoked when imagining another situation from a self-perspective or imagining from another perspective.<ref>Batson, C.D. (2009).

Suhr (Eds.), Handbook of Imagination and Mental Simulation (pp. 267-279). New York: Psychology Press.</ref> The former is often associated with [[personal distress]] (i.e., feelings of discomfort and anxiety), whereas the latter leads to empathic concern.\n\n==Social neuroscience evidence==\n\n[[Social neuroscience]] explores the biological underpinnings of empathic concern and more generally interpersonal sensitivity, using an integrative approach that bridges the biological and social levels.<ref>Decety, J., & Keenan, J.P. (2006). Social neuroscience: A new journal. Social Neuroscience, 1, 1-4.</ref> Neural systems, including autonomic functions, that rely on brain stem [[neuropeptides]], such as [[oxytocin]] and [[vasopressin]], are plausible correlates for empathic concern. Alternatively, vasopressin might be implicated in situations where a more active strategy is required for an effective response.<ref>Carter, C.S., Harris, J., & Porges, S.W. (2009). Neural and evolutionary perspectives on empathy In: J. Decety and W. Ickes, The Social Neuroscience of Empathy. Cambridge: MIT press, pp 169-182.</ref>\n\nAn association between [[executive functions]], underpinned by the [[prefrontal cortex]] with reciprocal connections with the [[limbic system]], the [[sense of agency]], and empathic concern has been suggested based on lesion studies in neurological patients and [[functional neuroimaging]] experiments in healthy individuals.<ref>Decety, J., & Jackson, P.L. (2004). The functional architecture of human empathy. Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience Reviews, 3, 71-100.</ref> \n\nThe difference between imaging self versus imaging other is supported by a series of [[functional neuroimaging]] studies of affective processing. For instance, Lamm, Batson and Decety (2007) found that participants reported more empathic concern when imagining the [[pain]] of others when adopting another perspective, and more personal [[suffering|distress]] when imagining themselves to be in pain.<ref>Lamm, C., Batson, C.D., & Decety, J. (2007). The neural substrate of human empathy: effects of perspective-taking and cognitive appraisal. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 19, 42-58.</ref> \n\nThe fMRI scans revealed that imagining self in pain was associated with strong activation in brain areas involved in affective response to threat and pain, including the amygdala, insula and anterior cingulate cortex. Imagine-other instructions produced higher activity in the right [[temporoparietal junction]] (or TPJ), which is associated with self-other distinctiveness and the sense of agency.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Affective neuroscience]]\n* [[C.
