However, the suitability of a PDF file for archival preservation depends on options chosen when the PDF is created: most notably, whether to embed the necessary fonts for rendering the document; whether to use encryption; and whether to preserve additional information from the original document beyond what is needed to print it.\n\nPDF/A was originally a new joint activity between the Association for Suppliers of Printing, Publishing and Converting Technologies ([[NPES]]) and the [[Association for Information and Image Management]] to develop an international standard defining the use of the Portable Document Format (PDF) for archiving documents.<ref name=\"nutshell-2-2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2013/02/a-short-history-of-pdfa/ |title=A short history of PDF/A |website=PDF Association |date=2013-02-07 |access-date=2014-07-11}}</ref> The goal was to address the growing need to electronically archive documents in a way that would ensure preservation of their contents over an extended period of time and ensure that those documents would be able to be retrieved and rendered with a consistent and predictable result in the future.<ref name=\"nutshell-2-3\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2013/02/the-most-important-reasons-to-use-pdfa/ |first=Alexandra |last=Oettler |title=The most important reasons to use PDF/A |website=PDF Association |date=2013-02-07 |access-date=2014-07-11}}</ref> This need exists in a wide variety of government, industry and academic areas worldwide, including legal systems, libraries, newspapers, and regulated industries.<ref name=\"nutshell-2-4\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2013/02/typical-uses-for-pdfa/ |first=Alexandra |last=Oettler |title=Typical uses for PDF/A |website=PDF Association |date=2013-02-07 |access-date=2014-07-11}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nThe PDF/A standard does not define an archiving strategy or the goals of an archiving system. It identifies a \"profile\" for electronic documents that ensures the documents can be reproduced exactly the same way using various software in years to come. A key element to this reproducibility is the requirement for PDF/A documents to be 100% self-contained. All of the information necessary for displaying the document in the same manner is embedded in the file. This includes, but is not limited to, all content (text, raster images and vector graphics), fonts, and color information. A PDF/A document is not permitted to be reliant on information from external sources (e.g. font programs and data streams), but may include annotations (e.g. hypertext links) that link to external documents.<ref name=\"nutshell-2-6\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2011/09/pdfa-%e2%80%93-ein-blick-auf-die-technische-seite/?lang=de |title=The technical side of the PDF/A standard |first=Alexandra |last=Oettler |website=PDF Association |date=2013-02-07 |access-date=2017-08-07 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702191437/http://www.pdfa.org/2011/09/pdfa-%e2%80%93-ein-blick-auf-die-technische-seite/?lang=de |archivedate=2015-07-02 }}</ref>\n\nOther key elements to PDF/A conformance include:<ref name=\"pdfa1-tech\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/doku.php?id=artikel:en:pdfa_a_look_at_the_technical-side |title=PDF/A \u2013 A Look at the Technical Side |accessdate=2011-07-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726045349/http://www.pdfa.org/doku.php?id=artikel:en:pdfa_a_look_at_the_technical-side |archivedate=2011-07-26 }}</ref><ref name=\"pdfa2-press\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2011/07/pdfa-2-standard-published-by-iso-the-new-standard-includes-great-technical-enhancements-free-informative-webinar-to-be-scheduled/ |title=PDF/A-2 Standard Published by ISO!

PDF/A-1 files will not necessarily conform to PDF/A-2, and PDF/A-2 compliant files will not necessarily conform to PDF/A-1.\n\nPart 2 of the PDF/A Standard is based on a PDF 1.7 (ISO 32000-1), rather than PDF 1.4 and offers a number of new features:\n* [[JPEG 2000]] image compression\n* support for transparency effects and layers\n* embedding of [[OpenType]] fonts\n* provisions for digital signatures in accordance with the PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures \u2013 PAdES standard\n* the option of embedding PDF/A files to facilitate archiving of sets of documents with a single file.<ref name=\"pdfa2-press\" />\n\nPart 2 defines three conformance levels. PDF/A-2a and PDF/A-2b correspond to conformance levels a and b in PDF/A-1.

To take one example, Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader 9 include an alert to advise the user that PDF/A viewing mode has been activated. Some PDF viewers allow users to disable the PDF/A viewing mode or to remove the PDF/A information from a file.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.adobe.com/acrolaw/2011/05/how-to-remove-pdfa-information-from-a-file/ |title=How to Remove PDF/A Information from a file |access-date=2014-04-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://help.adobe.com/en_US/acrobat/X/standard/using/WSe6c6ee3e336ebb13-630c189912be99aedab-7fff.html#WS3E0E8467-B787-4020-A1D3-6BC762A42DF2.w |title=Change the PDF/A viewing mode |access-date=2014-04-10}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nA PDF/A document must embed all fonts in use; accordingly, a PDF/A file will often be larger than an equivalent PDF file that does not include embedded fonts.\n\nThe use of transparency is forbidden in PDF/A-1. The majority of PDF generation tools that allow for PDF/A document compliance, such as the PDF export in OpenOffice.org or PDF export tool in Microsoft Office 2007 suites, will also make any transparent images in a given document non-transparent. That restriction was removed in PDF/A-2.<ref name=\"pdfa1-tech\" />\n\nSome archivists have voiced concerns that PDF/A-3, which allows arbitrary files to be embedded in PDF/A documents, could result in circumvention of memory institution procedures and restrictions on archived formats.<ref>{{citation |url=http://duff-johnson.com/2014/02/28/archivists-no-flowers-for-pdfa-3/ |title=Archivists: No flowers for PDF/A-3 |accessdate=2014-07-12}}</ref>\n\nThe PDF Association had addressed various misconceptions<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.pdfa.org/the-myths-and-legends-surrounding-pdfa/ |title=The myths and legends surrounding PDF/A |accessdate=2018-02-15}}</ref> regarding PDF/A in its publication \"PDF/A in a Nutshell 2.0\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pdfa.org/resource/pdfa-in-a-nutshell-2-0/|title=PDF/A in a Nutshell 2.0}}</ref>\n\nConverting a PDF (up to version 1.4) into a PDF/A-2 usually works as expected, except for problems with [[glyph]]s. According to the PDF Association, \"Problems can occur before and/or during the generation of PDFs. A PDF/A file can be formally correct yet still have incorrect glyphs.

However, the suitability of a PDF file for archival preservation depends on options chosen when the PDF is created: most notably, whether to embed the necessary fonts for rendering the document; whether to use encryption; and whether to preserve additional information from the original document beyond what is needed to print it.\n\nPDF/A was originally a new joint activity between the Association for Suppliers of Printing, Publishing and Converting Technologies ([[NPES]]) and the [[Association for Information and Image Management]] to develop an international standard defining the use of the Portable Document Format (PDF) for archiving documents.<ref name=\"nutshell-2-2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2013/02/a-short-history-of-pdfa/ |title=A short history of PDF/A |website=PDF Association |date=2013-02-07 |access-date=2014-07-11}}</ref> The goal was to address the growing need to electronically archive documents in a way that would ensure preservation of their contents over an extended period of time and ensure that those documents would be able to be retrieved and rendered with a consistent and predictable result in the future.<ref name=\"nutshell-2-3\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2013/02/the-most-important-reasons-to-use-pdfa/ |first=Alexandra |last=Oettler |title=The most important reasons to use PDF/A |website=PDF Association |date=2013-02-07 |access-date=2014-07-11}}</ref> This need exists in a wide variety of government, industry and academic areas worldwide, including legal systems, libraries, newspapers, and regulated industries.<ref name=\"nutshell-2-4\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2013/02/typical-uses-for-pdfa/ |first=Alexandra |last=Oettler |title=Typical uses for PDF/A |website=PDF Association |date=2013-02-07 |access-date=2014-07-11}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nThe PDF/A standard does not define an archiving strategy or the goals of an archiving system. It identifies a \"profile\" for electronic documents that ensures the documents can be reproduced exactly the same way using various software in years to come. A key element to this reproducibility is the requirement for PDF/A documents to be 100% self-contained. All of the information necessary for displaying the document in the same manner is embedded in the file. This includes, but is not limited to, all content (text, raster images and vector graphics), fonts, and color information. A PDF/A document is not permitted to be reliant on information from external sources (e.g. font programs and data streams), but may include annotations (e.g. hypertext links) that link to external documents.<ref name=\"nutshell-2-6\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2011/09/pdfa-%e2%80%93-ein-blick-auf-die-technische-seite/?lang=de |title=The technical side of the PDF/A standard |first=Alexandra |last=Oettler |website=PDF Association |date=2013-02-07 |access-date=2017-08-07 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702191437/http://www.pdfa.org/2011/09/pdfa-%e2%80%93-ein-blick-auf-die-technische-seite/?lang=de |archivedate=2015-07-02 }}</ref>\n\nOther key elements to PDF/A conformance include:<ref name=\"pdfa1-tech\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/doku.php?id=artikel:en:pdfa_a_look_at_the_technical-side |title=PDF/A \u2013 A Look at the Technical Side |accessdate=2011-07-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726045349/http://www.pdfa.org/doku.php?id=artikel:en:pdfa_a_look_at_the_technical-side |archivedate=2011-07-26 }}</ref><ref name=\"pdfa2-press\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2011/07/pdfa-2-standard-published-by-iso-the-new-standard-includes-great-technical-enhancements-free-informative-webinar-to-be-scheduled/ |title=PDF/A-2 Standard Published by ISO!

To take one example, Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader 9 include an alert to advise the user that PDF/A viewing mode has been activated. Some PDF viewers allow users to disable the PDF/A viewing mode or to remove the PDF/A information from a file.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.adobe.com/acrolaw/2011/05/how-to-remove-pdfa-information-from-a-file/ |title=How to Remove PDF/A Information from a file |access-date=2014-04-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://help.adobe.com/en_US/acrobat/X/standard/using/WSe6c6ee3e336ebb13-630c189912be99aedab-7fff.html#WS3E0E8467-B787-4020-A1D3-6BC762A42DF2.w |title=Change the PDF/A viewing mode |access-date=2014-04-10}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nA PDF/A document must embed all fonts in use; accordingly, a PDF/A file will often be larger than an equivalent PDF file that does not include embedded fonts.\n\nThe use of transparency is forbidden in PDF/A-1. The majority of PDF generation tools that allow for PDF/A document compliance, such as the PDF export in OpenOffice.org or PDF export tool in Microsoft Office 2007 suites, will also make any transparent images in a given document non-transparent. That restriction was removed in PDF/A-2.<ref name=\"pdfa1-tech\" />\n\nSome archivists have voiced concerns that PDF/A-3, which allows arbitrary files to be embedded in PDF/A documents, could result in circumvention of memory institution procedures and restrictions on archived formats.<ref>{{citation |url=http://duff-johnson.com/2014/02/28/archivists-no-flowers-for-pdfa-3/ |title=Archivists: No flowers for PDF/A-3 |accessdate=2014-07-12}}</ref>\n\nThe PDF Association had addressed various misconceptions<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.pdfa.org/the-myths-and-legends-surrounding-pdfa/ |title=The myths and legends surrounding PDF/A |accessdate=2018-02-15}}</ref> regarding PDF/A in its publication \"PDF/A in a Nutshell 2.0\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pdfa.org/resource/pdfa-in-a-nutshell-2-0/|title=PDF/A in a Nutshell 2.0}}</ref>\n\nConverting a PDF (up to version 1.4) into a PDF/A-2 usually works as expected, except for problems with [[glyph]]s. According to the PDF Association, \"Problems can occur before and/or during the generation of PDFs. A PDF/A file can be formally correct yet still have incorrect glyphs.

The referrer field is an optional part of the HTTP request sent by the [[web browser]] to the web server.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=//tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.5.2\n| title=Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content (RFC 7231 \u00a7 5.5.2)\n| quote=The \"referrer\" [sic] header field allows the user agent to specify a URI reference for the resource from which the target URI was obtained [\u2026]\n| date=June 2014\n| publisher=[[IETF]]\n| accessdate=2014-07-26}}</ref>\n\nMany websites log referrers as part of their attempt to [[web tracking|track their users]].

This can, in turn, cause problems: some web servers block parts of their website to web browsers that do not send the right referrer information, in an attempt to prevent [[deep linking]] or unauthorised use of images ([[bandwidth theft]]). Some proxy software has the ability to give the top-level address of the target website as the referrer, which usually prevents these problems while still not divulging the user's last-visited website.\n\nMany blogs publish referrer information in order to link back to people who are linking to them, and hence broaden the conversation. This has led, in turn, to the rise of [[referrer spam]]: the sending of fake referrer information in order to popularize the spammer's website.\n\nIt is possible to access the referrer information on the client side using document.referrer in [[JavaScript]].<ref name=\"document.referrer\">{{cite web\n| url=http://w3schools.com/jsref/prop_doc_referrer.asp\n| title=HTML DOM Document referrer Property\n| publisher=w3schools.com\n| accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref> This can be used, for example, to individualize a web page based on a user's search engine query. However, the referrer field does not always include queries, such as when using [[Google Search]] with https.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://blogs.adobe.com/digitalmarketing/analytics/the-impact-of-google-encrypted-search/\n| title=The Impact of Google Encrypted Search\n| last=Gundersen\n| first=Bret\n| date=2011-10-19\n| publisher=[[Adobe Systems|Adobe Digital Marketing Blog]]\n| accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref>\n\n== {{anchor|Referrer hiding}} Referer hiding ==\nMost web servers maintain logs of all traffic, and record the HTTP referrer sent by the web browser for each request. This raises a number of privacy concerns, and as a result, a number of systems to prevent web servers being sent the real referring URL have been developed. These systems work either by blanking the referrer field or by replacing it with inaccurate data. Generally, [[Internet security|Internet-security]] suites blank the referrer data, while web-based servers replace it with a false URL, usually their own. This raises the problem of referrer spam. The technical details of both methods are fairly consistent &nbsp;\u2013 software applications act as a [[proxy server]] and manipulate the HTTP request, while web-based methods load websites within frames, causing the web browser to send a referrer URL of their website address. Some web browsers give their users the option to turn off referrer fields in the request header.<ref name=\"sendRefererHeader\"/>\n\nMost web browsers do not send the referrer field when they are instructed to redirect using the \"Refresh\" field. This does not include some versions of [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] and many mobile web browsers. However, this method of redirection is discouraged by the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C).<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#meta-element\n| title=HTML Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0: The META element\n| date=2000-11-06\n| publisher=[[W3C]]\n| accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref>\n\nIf a website is accessed from a [[HTTP Secure]] (HTTPS) connection and a link points to anywhere except another secure location, then the referrer field is not sent.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=//tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.5.2\n| title=Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content: referrer (RFC 7231 \u00a7 5.5.2)\n| quote=A user agent {{sc|must not}} send a referrer header field in an unsecured HTTP request if the referring page was received with a secure protocol\n| date=June 2014\n| publisher=IETF\n| accessdate=2014-07-26}}</ref>\n\nThe [[HTML5]] standard added support for the attribute/value rel=\"noreferrer\", which instructs the user agent to not send a referrer.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=https://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/links.html#link-type-noreferrer\n| title=4.12 Links \u2014 HTML Living Standard: 4.12.5.8 Link type \"noreferrer\"\n| date=2016-02-19\n| publisher=[[WHATWG]]\n| accessdate=2016-02-19}}</ref>\n\nAnother referrer hiding method is to convert the original link URL to a [[Data URI scheme]]-based URL containing small HTML page with a [[meta refresh]] to the original URL. When the user is redirected from the <span style=\"font-family:monospace\">data:</span> page, the original referrer is hidden.\n\n[[Content Security Policy]] standard version 1.1 introduced a new ''referrer'' directive that allows more control over the browser's behavior in regards to the referrer header.

This has led, in turn, to the rise of [[referrer spam]]: the sending of fake referrer information in order to popularize the spammer's website.\n\nIt is possible to access the referrer information on the client side using document.referrer in [[JavaScript]].<ref name=\"document.referrer\">{{cite web\n| url=http://w3schools.com/jsref/prop_doc_referrer.asp\n| title=HTML DOM Document referrer Property\n| publisher=w3schools.com\n| accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref> This can be used, for example, to individualize a web page based on a user's search engine query. However, the referrer field does not always include queries, such as when using [[Google Search]] with https.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://blogs.adobe.com/digitalmarketing/analytics/the-impact-of-google-encrypted-search/\n| title=The Impact of Google Encrypted Search\n| last=Gundersen\n| first=Bret\n| date=2011-10-19\n| publisher=[[Adobe Systems|Adobe Digital Marketing Blog]]\n| accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref>\n\n== {{anchor|Referrer hiding}} Referer hiding ==\nMost web servers maintain logs of all traffic, and record the HTTP referrer sent by the web browser for each request. This raises a number of privacy concerns, and as a result, a number of systems to prevent web servers being sent the real referring URL have been developed. These systems work either by blanking the referrer field or by replacing it with inaccurate data. Generally, [[Internet security|Internet-security]] suites blank the referrer data, while web-based servers replace it with a false URL, usually their own. This raises the problem of referrer spam. The technical details of both methods are fairly consistent &nbsp;\u2013 software applications act as a [[proxy server]] and manipulate the HTTP request, while web-based methods load websites within frames, causing the web browser to send a referrer URL of their website address. Some web browsers give their users the option to turn off referrer fields in the request header.<ref name=\"sendRefererHeader\"/>\n\nMost web browsers do not send the referrer field when they are instructed to redirect using the \"Refresh\" field. This does not include some versions of [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] and many mobile web browsers. However, this method of redirection is discouraged by the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C).<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#meta-element\n| title=HTML Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0: The META element\n| date=2000-11-06\n| publisher=[[W3C]]\n| accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref>\n\nIf a website is accessed from a [[HTTP Secure]] (HTTPS) connection and a link points to anywhere except another secure location, then the referrer field is not sent.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=//tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.5.2\n| title=Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content: referrer (RFC 7231 \u00a7 5.5.2)\n| quote=A user agent {{sc|must not}} send a referrer header field in an unsecured HTTP request if the referring page was received with a secure protocol\n| date=June 2014\n| publisher=IETF\n| accessdate=2014-07-26}}</ref>\n\nThe [[HTML5]] standard added support for the attribute/value rel=\"noreferrer\", which instructs the user agent to not send a referrer.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=https://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/links.html#link-type-noreferrer\n| title=4.12 Links \u2014 HTML Living Standard: 4.12.5.8 Link type \"noreferrer\"\n| date=2016-02-19\n| publisher=[[WHATWG]]\n| accessdate=2016-02-19}}</ref>\n\nAnother referrer hiding method is to convert the original link URL to a [[Data URI scheme]]-based URL containing small HTML page with a [[meta refresh]] to the original URL. When the user is redirected from the <span style=\"font-family:monospace\">data:</span> page, the original referrer is hidden.\n\n[[Content Security Policy]] standard version 1.1 introduced a new ''referrer'' directive that allows more control over the browser's behavior in regards to the referrer header. Specifically it allows the webmaster to instruct the browser not to block referrer at all, reveal it only when moving with the same origin etc.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP11/#directive-referrer | title=Content Security Policy Level 2 | publisher=W3 | date=2014 | accessdate=2014-12-08}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|referer|referrer}}\n* RFC 7231: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content\n* RFC 3987: Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs)\n* [//w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/referrer-policy/ Referrer Policy - W3C Editor's Draft]\n\n[[Category:URI schemes]]\n[[Category:URL]]\n[[Category:Hypertext Transfer Protocol headers]]\n[[Category:Nonstandard spelling]]\n", "name_user": "2.90.253.153", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer"}

Vietnamese rare breed of chicken, familiar as a symbol in [[Vietnam]]. According to [[folklore]], the chicken (particularly the roosters) have the five qualities of a man of honour: literacy, martial arts, physical strength, humanity and loyalty. The symbolism in the context of the AIGs is that the G\u00e0 H\u1ed3 rooster rising himself to welcome the sun is linked to the readiness of the sports industry of Vietnam to host this major event.\n\n==Venues==\n* [[Hanoi]]\n** [[M\u1ef9 \u0110\u00ecnh National Stadium]]\n** [[Quan Ngua Sports Palace]]\n** [[My Dinh Indoor Athletics Gymnasium]]\n** [[My Dinh National Aquatics Sports Complex]]\n** [[Quan Ngua Sports Palace]]\n** [[Tu Liem Gymnasium]]\n** [[Trinh Hoai Duc Gymnasium]]\n** [[Ha Tay Gymnasium]]\n** [[Hai Ba Trung Gymnasium]]\n** [[Cau Giay Gymnasium]]\n** [[Gia Lam Gymnasium]]\n** [[Soc Son Gymnasium]]\n** [[Hanoi University of Technology|Gymnasium of Hanoi University of Technology]]\n[[File:AIG2009Mascot.png|thumb|right|140px|Official mascot]]\n[[File:Hanoi welcome 2009 Asian Indoor Games-261020092095.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Mascot printed in [[Hanoi]]]]\n* [[Ho Chi Minh City]]\n** [[Tan Binh Gymnasium]]\n** [[Phu Tho Indoor Stadium]]\n** [[Lang Binh Thang Gymnasium]]\n** [[University of Pedagogy Competition Hall]]\n** [[Rach Mieu Gymnasium]]\n** [[Van Don Gymnasium]]\n** [[Quan Khu 7 Gymnasium]]\n** [[Phan Dinh Phung Gymnasium]]\n** [[Nguyen Du Gymnasium]]\n** [[Superbowl Center]]\n* [[Hai Phong]]\n** [[Haiphong Youth Gymnasium]]\n** [[Haiphong Gymnasium]]\n* [[Qu\u1ea3ng Ninh]]\n** [[Quang Ninh Gymnasium]]\n** [[Halong Pearl Halong]]\n* [[B\u1eafc Ninh]]\n** [[Bac Ninh Gymnasium]]\n* [[H\u1ea3i D\u01b0\u01a1ng]]\n** [[Haiduong Gymnasium]]\n\n==Participating nations==\n\nAll of OCA members participated in the Games, excluding: [[Pakistan]], [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestine]], & [[Timor-Leste]].

{"title_page": "Listed buildings in Southport", "text_new": "[[Southport]] is a seaside town in [[Metropolitan Borough of Sefton|Sefton]], [[Merseyside]], England.  It contains 174&nbsp;buildings that are recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as designated [[listed building]]s.   Of these, three are listed at Grade&nbsp;II*, the middle of the three grades, and the others are at Grade&nbsp;II, the lowest grade.  There are no buildings listed at Grade&nbsp;I.\n\nSouthport did not develop as a town until the late 18th&nbsp;century.  Before that it contained only small settlements and fishermen's cottages.  Most of the listed buildings are located to the north of the present town centre and consist mainly of small houses, many of them in a single storey, [[stucco|rendered]] or [[roughcast]], and with thatched or [[slate]]d roofs.  As the town developed and grew, its larger buildings were constructed, including villas, shops, churches, and public buildings.  The major thoroughfare in the town is [[Lord Street, Southport|Lord Street]], a wide road running north-south mainly with shops on the west side, and gardens and public buildings on the east side.  A feature of the shops is that a high proportion are fronted by [[verandah]]s in [[cast iron]] and glass.  Many of the shops are listed, and most of the verandahs are also listed, but separately from the shops.  The listed public buildings on the east side of the road include the [[Southport Town Hall|Town Hall]], the [[Atkinson Art Gallery and Library]], and the [[Southport Arts Centre]].  Also on this side of the road is an extensive [[Southport War Memorial|War Memorial]].  A [[Southport Pier|pier]] was built in 1859\u201360, and from 1885 the foreshore was developed, with its Marine Lake, which is surrounded by listed cast iron shelters.  Also on the Promenade were built hotels, a hospital, and swimming baths.{{sfnp|Hartwell|Pevsner|2009|pp=618\u2013619, 626\u2013635|ps=}}\n\n==Key==\n{{GeoGroupTemplate}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

"text_old": "[[Southport]] is a seaside town in [[Metropolitan Borough of Sefton|Sefton]], [[Merseyside]], England.  It contains 174&nbsp;buildings that are recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as designated [[listed building]]s.   Of these, three are listed at Grade&nbsp;II*, the middle of the three grades, and the others are at Grade&nbsp;II, the lowest grade.  There are no buildings listed at Grade&nbsp;I.\n\nSouthport did not develop as a town until the late 18th&nbsp;century.  Before that it contained only small settlements and fishermen's cottages.  Most of the listed buildings are located to the north of the present town centre and consist mainly of small houses, many of them in a single storey, [[stucco|rendered]] or [[roughcast]], and with thatched or [[slate]]d roofs.  As the town developed and grew, its larger buildings were constructed, including villas, shops, churches, and public buildings.  The major thoroughfare in the town is [[Lord Street, Southport|Lord Street]], a wide road running north-south mainly with shops on the west side, and gardens and public buildings on the east side.  A feature of the shops is that a high proportion are fronted by [[verandah]]s in [[cast iron]] and glass.  Many of the shops are listed, and most of the verandahs are also listed, but separately from the shops.  The listed public buildings on the east side of the road include the [[Southport Town Hall|Town Hall]], the [[Atkinson Art Gallery and Library]], and the [[Southport Arts Centre]].  Also on this side of the road is an extensive [[Southport War Memorial|War Memorial]].  A [[Southport Pier|pier]] was built in 1859\u201360, and from 1885 the foreshore was developed, with its Marine Lake, which is surrounded by listed cast iron shelters.  Also on the Promenade were built hotels, a hospital, and swimming baths.{{sfnp|Hartwell|Pevsner|2009|pp=618\u2013619, 626\u2013635|ps=}}\n\n==Key==\n{{GeoGroupTemplate}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

She turned down a role in ''[[The Hasty Heart]]'' (1949), which she wanted to do, but it would have meant going to England, and she did not want to leave her baby alone during its first year. \"I probably received my salary for only six months during 1947 and 1948, but I can't regret that\", she said. \"All my life, I wanted a child, and anything that might happen to me professionally on that account would hardly seem a loss.\"<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\nShe returned in ''[[Chain Lightning (1950 film)|Chain Lightning]]'' with [[Humphrey Bogart]]. \"I've had my fling at roles that have little or no relation to most people's lives\", she said in a 1949 interview. \"I want to keep away from such assignments, as I can from now on, even though, as some may say, they mean exercising your skill and talent in acting.\"<ref name=\"los\">{{cite news|title=Eleanor Parker in Lively Return: Back on Job, Eleanor Parker Calls for True-to-Life Roles|last=Schallert|first= Edwin|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=15 May 1949|page= D1}}</ref>\n<!-- \nParker broke the champagne bottle on the nose of the ''[[California Zephyr]]'' train, to mark its inaugural journey from [[San Francisco]] on March 19, 1949. -->\n\nParker heard about a film Warners were making of a woman in prison , ''[[Caged (1950 film)|Caged]]'' (1950), and actively lobbied the role.

She also had a good role in the melodrama ''[[Three Secrets]]'' (1950).\n\nIn February 1950, Parker left Warner Bros. after having been under contract there for eight years. Parker had understood that she would star in a film called ''Safe Harbor'', but Warner Bros. apparently had no intention of making it.

She tried a comedy at 20th Century Fox with [[Fred MacMurray]], ''[[A Millionaire for Christy]]'' (1951) (originally called ''The Golden Goose'').\n\nIn 1951, Parker signed a contract with Paramount for one film a year, with an option for outside films.<ref>{{cite news|title=Eleanor Parker Goes 'Uncaged' in Comedy: Vacation From Heavy Drama Roles Also Answers Problem of Typing |last=Scott|first= John L.|newspaper= Los Angeles Times|date=11 Feb 1951|page=D3}}</ref> This arrangement began brilliantly with ''[[Detective Story (1951 film)|Detective Story]]'' (1951) for director [[William Wyler]], playing Mary McLeod, the woman who doesn't understand the position of her unstable detective husband (played by [[Kirk Douglas]]); Parker was nominated for the [[Academy Award|Oscar]] in 1951 for her performance.\n\n===MGM===\nParker followed ''Detective Story'' with her portrayal of an actress in love with a swashbuckling nobleman (played by [[Stewart Granger]]) in ''[[Scaramouche (1952 film)|Scaramouche]]'' (1952), a role originally intended for [[Ava Gardner]]. Parker later claimed that Granger was the only person she didn't get along with during her entire career.<ref name=\"noir\"/> However, they had good chemistry, and the film was a massive hit; MGM rushed her into ''[[Above and Beyond (1952 film)|Above and Beyond]]'' (1952), a biopic of Lt. Col. [[Paul Tibbets|Paul W. Tibbets, Jr.]] (Robert Taylor), the pilot of the aircraft that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. It was a solid hit. While Parker was making a third film for MGM, ''[[Escape from Fort Bravo]]'' (1953), she signed a five-year contract to the studio.<ref>{{cite news|title=Eleanor Parker in Deal at Metro: Actress Signs Five-Year Pact With Studio{{snd}}Will Appear in Gordon-Kanin Comedy|newspaper=The New York Times |date=1 Aug 1952|page=9}}</ref>\n\nShe was named as star of a [[Sidney Sheldon]] script, ''My Most Intimate Friend''<ref>{{cite news|title=Eleanor Parker Will Enact TV Narrator|last=Hopper|first= Hedda|newspaper= Los Angeles Times|date=8 May 1953|page= B10}}</ref> and of ''One More Time'', from a script by [[Ruth Gordon]] and [[Garson Kanin]] directed by [[George Cukor]], but neither film was made. Back at Paramount, Parker starred with [[Charlton Heston]] as a 1900s mail-order bride in ''[[The Naked Jungle]]'' (1954), directed by [[Byron Haskin]] and produced by [[George Pal]].\n\nParker returned to MGM where she was reunited with Robert Taylor in an Egyptian adventure film, ''[[Valley of the Kings (film)|Valley of the Kings]]'' (1954), and a Western, ''[[Many Rivers to Cross (film)|Many Rivers to Cross]]'' (1955).\n\n\"I maintain that if you work, believe in yourself, and do what is right for you without stepping all over others, the way somehow opens up\", she said in 1953. \"By that, I don't mean just sitting back.

She played Zosh, a woman confined to a wheelchair and the wife of [[heroin]]-addicted, would-be jazz drummer Frankie Machine ([[Frank Sinatra]]). It was a major commercial and critical success.\n\nIn 1956, she was billed above the title with [[Clark Gable]] for the [[Raoul Walsh]]-directed [[Western (genre)|Western]] comedy ''[[The King and Four Queens]]'', also for United Artists.\n\nIt was then back at MGM for two movies, both dramas: ''[[Lizzie (1957 film)|Lizzie]]'' (1957), in the title role, as a woman with a split personality; ''[[The Seventh Sin]]'' (1957), a remake of ''[[The Painted Veil (1934 film)|The Painted Veil]]'' in the role originated by [[Greta Garbo]] and, once again, intended for [[Ava Gardner]]. Both films flopped at the box office and, as a result, Parker's plans to produce her own film, ''L'Eternelle'', about French resistance fighters, did not materialize.<ref>{{cite news|title=Eleanor Parker Plans War Heroine Picture; Maria Schell Weds Soon|last=Schallert|first= Edwin|newspaper= Los Angeles Times |date=29 Mar 1957|page= A7}}</ref>\n\n==Later films, and transition into television and theatre==\nParker supported [[Frank Sinatra]] in a popular comedy, ''[[A Hole in the Head]]'' (1959). She returned to MGM for ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), co-starring with [[Robert Mitchum]], then took over [[Lana Turner]]'s role of Constance Rossi in ''[[Return to Peyton Place (film)|Return to Peyton Place]]'', a 1961 sequel to the hit 1957 film. That was made by 20th Century Fox who also produced ''[[Madison Avenue (film)|Madison Avenue]]'' (1961) with Parker.\n\nIn 1960, she made her TV debut. \"I look for the quality story and for parts that I think will be good or fun. People told me I was crazy to do ''Hole in the Head'' and ''Home from the Hill'', but both those pictures appealed to me. I did enough of the bad ones (films), while I was under contract \u2013 because I was being told to do them. That's the problem with being under contract. You do the pictures, or be suspended. Now, I don't want to work unless I have faith in the part. This has nothing to do with wanting to be famous, or anything like that. It's just that I love acting.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=TV Debut: Eleanor Parker in Hemingway Story |last=Barnes|first= Aleene|newspaper= Los Angeles Times|date=15 May 1960|page= O3}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1960s, she worked increasingly in television, with the occasional film role such as ''[[Panic Button (1964 film)|Panic Button]]'' (1964).\n\nParker's best-known screen role was playing Baroness Elsa Schraeder in the 1965 [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning musical ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]''. The Baroness was famously and poignantly unsuccessful in keeping the affections of Captain [[Georg von Trapp]] (played by [[Christopher Plummer]]) after he falls in love with Maria (played by [[Julie Andrews]]).\n\nIn 1966, she played an [[alcoholic]] widow in the crime drama ''[[Warning Shot (1967 film)|Warning Shot]]'', a talent scout who discovers a Hollywood star in ''[[The Oscar (film)|The Oscar]]'', and a rich alcoholic in ''[[An American Dream (film)|An American Dream]]''. From the late 1960s, television would occupy more of her energies.\n\n[[File:Eleanor Park star HWF.JPG|thumb|right|Star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6340 Hollywood Blvd.]]\nIn 1963, Parker appeared in the [[NBC]] [[medical drama]] about [[psychiatry]] ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]]'' in the episode \"Why Am I Grown So Cold?\", for which she was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] as Outstanding Single Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role.

Parker appeared in the NBC series ''[[Ghost Story (TV series)|Ghost Story]]'' episode \"Half a Death\" (1972), a suspense-thriller about a wealthy woman reconciling the lives of her two daughters. She starred in a number of made for TV movies, and made guest appearances on series such as ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[The Love Boat]]'', ''[[Hotel (U.S. TV series)|Hotel]]'', and ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]''.

After graduation, she went to [[Martha's Vineyard]] to work on her acting. She got a job as a waitress, and was offered a screen test by [[20th Century Fox]], but turned it down. Wanting to focus on films, she moved to California and started appearing at the [[Pasadena Playhouse]].<ref name=\"hedda\">{{cite news|title=Eleanor Parker Lives Up to Plan|last=Hopper|first=Hedda|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|location=Los Angeles, CA|date=11 Nov 1951|page=E1}}</ref>\n\n===Warner Bros===\nShe was in the audience one night at Pasadena Playhouse when spotted by a Warners Bros talent scout, Irving Kumin.

This impressed Warners enough so when [[Joan Leslie]] was held up on ''Rhapsody in Blue'', Parker replaced her in a strong role in a prestige production, ''[[Between Two Worlds (1944 film)|Between Two Worlds]]'' (1944), playing the suicidal wife of [[Paul Henreid]]'s character.\n\nShe stayed in support roles for ''[[Crime by Night]]'' (1944) and ''[[The Last Ride (1944 film)|The Last Ride]]'' (1944), then was given the starring role opposite Dennis Morgan in ''[[The Very Thought of You (film)|The Very Thought of You]]'' (1944), replacing [[Ida Lupino]]. She was considered enough of a \"name\" to be given a cameo in ''[[Hollywood Canteen (film)|Hollywood Canteen]]'' (1944). Warners gave her the choice role of Mildred Rogers in a new version of [[Somerset Maugham]]'s ''[[Of Human Bondage (1946 film)|Of Human Bondage]]'' (1946); although director [[Edmund Goulding]] called Parker one of the five greatest actresses in America,<ref>{{cite news|title=Director Lauds Eleanor Parker|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=16 July 1946|page= A3}}</ref> previews were not favorable, and the film sat on the shelf for two years before being released to an underwhelming reception.

She refused to appear in ''[[Somewhere in the City (1948 film)|Somewhere in the City]]'' (1948) so Warners suspended her again; [[Virginia Mayo]] played the role.<ref>{{cite news|title=Studio Suspends Eleanor Parker: Warner Brothers' Actress Said to Have Refused New Role{{snd}}Virginia Mayo in Place|newspaper=The New York Times |date=31 July 1948 |page=9}}</ref>\n\nParker then had two years off, during which time she married and had a baby. She turned down a role in ''[[The Hasty Heart]]'' (1949), which she wanted to do, but it would have meant going to England, and she did not want to leave her baby alone during its first year. \"I probably received my salary for only six months during 1947 and 1948, but I can't regret that\", she said. \"All my life, I wanted a child, and anything that might happen to me professionally on that account would hardly seem a loss.\"<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\nShe returned in ''[[Chain Lightning (1950 film)|Chain Lightning]]'' with [[Humphrey Bogart]]. \"I've had my fling at roles that have little or no relation to most people's lives\", she said in a 1949 interview. \"I want to keep away from such assignments, as I can from now on, even though, as some may say, they mean exercising your skill and talent in acting.\"<ref name=\"los\">{{cite news|title=Eleanor Parker in Lively Return: Back on Job, Eleanor Parker Calls for True-to-Life Roles|last=Schallert|first= Edwin|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=15 May 1949|page= D1}}</ref>\n<!-- \nParker broke the champagne bottle on the nose of the ''[[California Zephyr]]'' train, to mark its inaugural journey from [[San Francisco]] on March 19, 1949. -->\n\nParker heard about a woman in prison film Warners were making, ''[[Caged (1950 film)|Caged]]'' (1950), and actively lobbied the role. She got it, and won the 1950 [[Volpi Cup]] for Best Actress at the [[Venice Film Festival]] and was nominated for an Academy Award. She also had a good role in the melodrama ''[[Three Secrets]]'' (1950).\n\nIn February 1950, Parker left Warner Bros. after having been under contract there for eight years. Parker had understood that she would star in a film called ''Safe Harbor'', but Warner Bros. apparently had no intention of making it. Because of this misunderstanding, her agents negotiated her release.<ref>{{cite news|title=Drama: 'All-Star Game' On Way; Lupino Has New Find; Parker Contract Ended|last=Schallert|first= Edwin|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1 Feb 1950|page= A7}}</ref>\n\n===Paramount===\nParker's career outside of Warners started badly with ''[[Valentino (1951 film)|Valentino]]'' (1951) playing a fictionalized wife of [[Rudolph Valentino]] for producer [[Edward Small]]. She tried a comedy at 20th Century Fox with [[Fred MacMurray]], ''[[A Millionaire for Christy]]'' (1951) (originally called ''The Golden Goose'').\n\nIn 1951, Parker signed a contract with Paramount for one film a year, with an option for outside films.<ref>{{cite news|title=Eleanor Parker Goes 'Uncaged' in Comedy: Vacation From Heavy Drama Roles Also Answers Problem of Typing |last=Scott|first= John L.|newspaper= Los Angeles Times|date=11 Feb 1951|page=D3}}</ref> This arrangement began brilliantly with ''[[Detective Story (1951 film)|Detective Story]]'' (1951) for director [[William Wyler]], playing Mary McLeod, the woman who doesn't understand the position of her unstable detective husband (played by [[Kirk Douglas]]); Parker was nominated for the [[Academy Award|Oscar]] in 1951 for her performance.\n\n===MGM===\nParker followed ''Detective Story'' with her portrayal of an actress in love with a swashbuckling nobleman (played by [[Stewart Granger]]) in ''[[Scaramouche (1952 film)|Scaramouche]]'' (1952), a role originally intended for [[Ava Gardner]]. Parker later claimed that Granger was the only person she didn't get along with during her entire career.<ref name=\"noir\"/> However, they had good chemistry, and the film was a massive hit; MGM rushed her into ''[[Above and Beyond (1952 film)|Above and Beyond]]'' (1952), a biopic of Lt. Col. [[Paul Tibbets|Paul W. Tibbets, Jr.]] (Robert Taylor), the pilot of the aircraft that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. It was a solid hit. While Parker was making a third film for MGM, ''[[Escape from Fort Bravo]]'' (1953), she signed a five-year contract to the studio.<ref>{{cite news|title=Eleanor Parker in Deal at Metro: Actress Signs Five-Year Pact With Studio{{snd}}Will Appear in Gordon-Kanin Comedy|newspaper=The New York Times |date=1 Aug 1952|page=9}}</ref>\n\nShe was named as star of a [[Sidney Sheldon]] script, ''My Most Intimate Friend''<ref>{{cite news|title=Eleanor Parker Will Enact TV Narrator|last=Hopper|first= Hedda|newspaper= Los Angeles Times|date=8 May 1953|page= B10}}</ref> and of ''One More Time'', from a script by [[Ruth Gordon]] and [[Garson Kanin]] directed by [[George Cukor]], but neither film was made. Back at Paramount, Parker starred with [[Charlton Heston]] as a 1900s mail-order bride in ''[[The Naked Jungle]]'' (1954), directed by [[Byron Haskin]] and produced by [[George Pal]].\n\nParker returned to MGM where she was reunited with Robert Taylor in an Egyptian adventure film, ''[[Valley of the Kings (film)|Valley of the Kings]]'' (1954), and a Western, ''[[Many Rivers to Cross (film)|Many Rivers to Cross]]'' (1955).\n\n\"I maintain that if you work, believe in yourself, and do what is right for you without stepping all over others, the way somehow opens up\", she said in 1953. \"By that, I don't mean just sitting back. At Warners, they still have a mile-long list of my suspensions for refusing certain parts. Anyway, I never did a Western. Not once. It's paid off too.\"<ref name=\"howard\"/>\n\nIn a 1954 interview, she said her favorite films were ''Caged'' and ''Detective Story'' and her least favorite were ''Chain Lightning'', ''Escape Me Never'', ''Valentino'', and ''Woman in White''. She had commitments to make two films a year at MGM, and one a year at Paramount. \"Personally, I prefer to be under contract\", she said.<ref name=\"times\">{{cite news|title=Eleanor Likes Her Co-workers and the Feeling's Mutual|last=Scheuer|first= Philip K.|newspaper= Los Angeles Times |date=28 Feb 1954|page= D1}}</ref>\n\nMGM gave her one of her best roles as opera singer [[Marjorie Lawrence]] in ''[[Interrupted Melody]]'' (1955). This was a big hit and earned Parker a third Oscar nomination; she later said it was her favorite film.<ref name=\"noir\"/>\n\nAlso in 1955, Parker appeared in the film adaptation of the [[National Book Award]]-winner ''[[The Man with the Golden Arm]]'' (1955), directed by [[Otto Preminger]] and released through [[United Artists]]. She played Zosh, a woman confined to a wheelchair and the wife of [[heroin]]-addicted, would-be jazz drummer Frankie Machine ([[Frank Sinatra]]). It was a major commercial and critical success.\n\nIn 1956, she was billed above the title with [[Clark Gable]] for the [[Raoul Walsh]]-directed [[Western (genre)|Western]] comedy ''[[The King and Four Queens]]'', also for United Artists.\n\nIt was then back at MGM for two movies, both dramas: ''[[Lizzie (1957 film)|Lizzie]]'' (1957), in the title role, as a woman with a split personality; ''[[The Seventh Sin]]'' (1957), a remake of ''[[The Painted Veil (1934 film)|The Painted Veil]]'' in the role originated by [[Greta Garbo]] and, once again, intended for [[Ava Gardner]]. Both films flopped at the box office and, as a result, Parker's plans to produce her own film, ''L'Eternelle'', about French resistance fighters, did not materialize.<ref>{{cite news|title=Eleanor Parker Plans War Heroine Picture; Maria Schell Weds Soon|last=Schallert|first= Edwin|newspaper= Los Angeles Times |date=29 Mar 1957|page= A7}}</ref>\n\n==Later films, and transition into television and theatre==\nParker supported [[Frank Sinatra]] in a popular comedy, ''[[A Hole in the Head]]'' (1959). She returned to MGM for ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), co-starring with [[Robert Mitchum]], then took over [[Lana Turner]]'s role of Constance Rossi in ''[[Return to Peyton Place (film)|Return to Peyton Place]]'', a 1961 sequel to the hit 1957 film. That was made by 20th Century Fox who also produced ''[[Madison Avenue (film)|Madison Avenue]]'' (1961) with Parker.\n\nIn 1960, she made her TV debut. \"I look for the quality story and for parts that I think will be good or fun. People told me I was crazy to do ''Hole in the Head'' and ''Home from the Hill'', but both those pictures appealed to me. I did enough of the bad ones (films), while I was under contract \u2013 because I was being told to do them. That's the problem with being under contract. You do the pictures, or be suspended. Now, I don't want to work unless I have faith in the part. This has nothing to do with wanting to be famous, or anything like that. It's just that I love acting.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=TV Debut: Eleanor Parker in Hemingway Story |last=Barnes|first= Aleene|newspaper= Los Angeles Times|date=15 May 1960|page= O3}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1960s, she worked increasingly in television, with the occasional film role such as ''[[Panic Button (1964 film)|Panic Button]]'' (1964).\n\nParker's best-known screen role was playing Baroness Elsa Schraeder in the 1965 [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning musical ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]''. The Baroness was famously and poignantly unsuccessful in keeping the affections of Captain [[Georg von Trapp]] (played by [[Christopher Plummer]]) after he falls in love with Maria (played by [[Julie Andrews]]).\n\nIn 1966, she played an [[alcoholic]] widow in the crime drama ''[[Warning Shot (1967 film)|Warning Shot]]'', a talent scout who discovers a Hollywood star in ''[[The Oscar (film)|The Oscar]]'', and a rich alcoholic in ''[[An American Dream (film)|An American Dream]]''. From the late 1960s, television would occupy more of her energies.\n\n[[File:Eleanor Park star HWF.JPG|thumb|right|Star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6340 Hollywood Blvd.]]\nIn 1963, Parker appeared in the [[NBC]] [[medical drama]] about [[psychiatry]] ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]]'' in the episode \"Why Am I Grown So Cold?\", for which she was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] as Outstanding Single Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role.

Parker appeared in the NBC series ''[[Ghost Story (TV series)|Ghost Story]]'' episode \"Half a Death\" (1972), a suspense-thriller about a wealthy woman reconciling the lives of her two daughters. She starred in a number of made for TV movies, and made guest appearances on series such as ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[The Love Boat]]'', ''[[Hotel (U.S. TV series)|Hotel]]'', and ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]''. Her final TV role was a small supporting role in the 1991 TV movie ''Dead on the Money''.\n\nConcurrent with her TV career, Parker starred in a number of [[theatre|theatrical productions]], including the role of Margo Channing in ''[[Applause (musical)|Applause]]'', the Broadway [[Musical theater|musical]] version of the film ''[[All About Eve]]''. The role was originally played in the musical by [[Lauren Bacall]] and in ''All About Eve'' by [[Bette Davis]].
