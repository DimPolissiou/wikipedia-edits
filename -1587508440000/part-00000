The demo garnered some attention for the band within the underground metal press circuit as well as helped them score gigs alongside [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]], [[3 Inches of Blood]], [[Hate Eternal]], [[Into Eternity (band)|Into Eternity]] and [[Aborted]].\n\nIn November \u201805, the band began work on what would become their first proper full-length ''From Ashes'' with engineer John Haddad ([[Intronaut]], [[Eyes of Fire (band)|Eyes of Fire]], [[Phobia (band)|Phobia]]). The resulting nine songs paid special attention to not only brutality, but song craft as well and earned the band a remarkable international press response for a debut album. On the strength of ''From Ashes'', they earned their first U.S. tour, a five-week juggernaut alongside [[Six Feet Under (band)|Six Feet Under]] and [[Decapitated (band)|Decapitated]] and played as support throughout their home state with the likes of [[Suffocation (band)|Suffocation]], [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]], [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]], [[Goatwhore]] and [[Decrepit Birth]].\n\nIn 2007, Abysmal Dawn played a handful of festivals (LA Murderfest, Gathering of the Sick, Burning Star Metal Fest, and more) but most of the band\u2019s time was devoted to writing and rehearsing new material for their follow-up to ''From Ashes''. By November, Abysmal Dawn had entered Haddad\u2019s new studio to begin the next full-length.\n\nAbysmal Dawn spent the next three-months in and out of the studio crafting ''[[Programmed to Consume]]''. One by one, track by track, the pieces of this record came together, including brand new artwork once again from Par Olofsson. In February 2008, Abysmal Dawn signed a deal with Relapse Records, making ''Programmed to Consume'' the band\u2019s label debut. Abysmal Dawn released this album on May 13 (May 19 internationally).\n\nAfter three years passed since the release ''Leveling the Plane of Existence'' they finally released their fourth studio album ''[[Obsolescence (album)|Obsolescence]]'' on October 28, 2014 via [[Relapse Records]]. According to Abysmal Dawn's frontman Charles Elliott, the title of the album was inspired by the term 'planned obsolescence', and is applied to all of mankind.

In each episode, one of the hosts would take a seemingly boring topic, and try to make the other believe that it is interesting. These topics have varied from [[mold]] to [[interest rates]]. The podcast was hosted by [[Gimlet Media]]. \n\nThe idea for the podcast came from the friendship that developed when McKay and Davidson worked together on ''[[The Big Short (film)|The Big Short]]''. McKay and Davidson would have long conversations when they would try to \"out-fascinate\" each other and make dull subjects seem interesting.<ref name=guardian/>\n\nAfter searching for a new host for the show, Gimlet chose former ''[[Science Friday]]'' correspondent Flora Lichtman to take over, but decided to rebrand the show under a new name.

Speed limit signs are a red circle with a white background and the limitation in black, and are in kilometres per hour. There are also some signs unique to New Zealand.

language|M\u0101ori]]: '''''Waka Kotahi''''') uses a [[Linearity|linear]] location referencing system for its State Highway network, nationwide.<ref>https://www.nzta.govt.nz/assets/resources/location-ref-management-sys-manual/docs/SM051-part-b.pdf New Zealand Transport Agency LRMS Manual SM051 Retrieved 18-03-2019</ref> This assists roading contractors, safety auditors and emergency services in pin-pointing locations across the country. The LRMS features several types of signs and methods of reference. All KMP's are installed using a calibrated [[Odometer#Trip_meters|Trip Meter]] from the beginning of the road. ERP's however, are placed using land surveying equipment.\n\nAll LRMS signs are installed on the 'true left' side of the lane or carriageway, this is determined by the left hand side when facing the increasing direction, The increasing direction of travel is the direction in which positive measurements are made. Divided carriageways (roads with concrete berms or centrelines) have an Increasing (I) side and a Decreasing (D) side. This can be seen on LRMS signs in these areas.\n\n===Established Route Position (ERP)===\nEstablished Route Position signs are used to highlight a special location or bearing on the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, usually every 3km. They feature the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 3 metres. ERP signs are double-sided and feature a reflective green strip. They also have a small yellow triangle on the post pointing in the roads increasing direction.\n\n===Kilometre Marker Post (KMP)===\nKilometre Marker Post signs are used to highlight the progression along the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, every 1000 metres. They feature the State Highway Shield, the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 100 metres. KMP signs are on plastic, flexible posts. They are double-sided and feature a reflective black strip.\n\n===Reference Station (RS)===\nReference Station signs are placed at the change of a Reference Station, or beginning of a Highway. KMP and ERP signs are reset to zero at the beginning of each RS.\n<gallery>\nFile:Established Route Point Sign.jpg|'''ERP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 3km)\nFile:Kilometre Marker Post Sign.jpg|'''KMP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 1km)\nFile:Route Station Marker Sign.jpg|'''RS Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 591)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Speed limits in New Zealand]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Traffic signs}}\n\n[[Category:Road transport in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Road signs by country|New Zealand]]\n", "text_old": "'''Road signs in New Zealand''' are similar to those set by the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]]. While New Zealand is not a signatory to the convention, its [[road sign]]s are generally close in shape and function. New Zealand uses yellow diamond-shaped signs for warnings in common with [[Australia]], the Americas, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Japan]] and [[Thailand]]. Speed limit signs are a red circle with a white background and the limitation in black, and are in kilometres per hour. There are also some signs unique to New Zealand. Road signs in New Zealand are controlled by the [[NZ Transport Agency]] and are prescribed in the Land Transport Rule: Traffic Control Devices 2004 and set out in the ''Traffic Control Devices (TCD) Manual''.<ref name=\"New Zealand Transport Agency\">{{cite book | url=http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/traffic-control-devices-manual/sign-specifications/ | title=Traffic Control Devices Manual | publisher=New Zealand Transport Agency | accessdate=2012-07-15 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMost of these signs were only introduced in 1987, replacing older-style signs with white text on black backgrounds - square with a red border for regulatory signs and diamond with a yellow border. The only signs that remained the same were the Stop sign and the speed limit sign (although the \"km/h\" legend from metrication was removed). Some of these signs can still be seen on some rural roads.\n\nNew Zealand [[Right- and left-hand traffic|drives on the left]].\n\n==Regulatory==\nSpeed limits are posted in multiples of {{convert|10|km/h|mph|1|abbr=~}}, and range from {{convert|10|-|110|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, with 110&nbsp;km/h being the maximum legal speed for motor vehicles in New Zealand. The ''Manual of Traffic Signs and Markings'' specifies that [[#Permanent Warning|advisory speed]]s (PW-25) always end in digit \"5\", however there are some advisory speed signs that do not comply with the ''Manual'' and end in zero.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Charlton |first1=S.G. |last2=de Pont |first2=J.J. |title=Curve Speed Management |url=

language|M\u0101ori]]: '''''Waka Kotahi''''') uses a [[Linearity|linear]] location referencing system for its State Highway network, nationwide.<ref>https://www.nzta.govt.nz/assets/resources/location-ref-management-sys-manual/docs/SM051-part-b.pdf New Zealand Transport Agency LRMS Manual SM051 Retrieved 18-03-2019</ref> This assists roading contractors, safety auditors and emergency services in pin-pointing locations across the country. The LRMS features several types of signs and methods of reference. All KMP's are installed using a calibrated [[Odometer#Trip_meters|Trip Meter]] from the beginning of the road. ERP's however, are placed using land surveying equipment.\n\nAll LRMS signs are installed on the 'true left' side of the lane or carriageway, this is determined by the left hand side when facing the increasing direction, The increasing direction of travel is the direction in which positive measurements are made. Divided carriageways (roads with concrete berms or centrelines) have an Increasing (I) side and a Decreasing (D) side. This can be seen on LRMS signs in these areas.\n\n===Established Route Position (ERP)===\nEstablished Route Position signs are used to highlight a special location or bearing on the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, usually every 3km. They feature the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 3 metres. ERP signs are double-sided and feature a reflective green strip. They also have a small yellow triangle on the post pointing in the roads increasing direction.\n\n===Kilometre Marker Post (KMP)===\nKilometre Marker Post signs are used to highlight the progression along the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, every 1000 metres. They feature the State Highway Shield, the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 100 metres. KMP signs are on plastic, flexible posts. They are double-sided and feature a reflective black strip.\n\n===Reference Station (RS)===\nReference Station signs are placed at the change of a Reference Station, or beginning of a Highway. KMP and ERP signs are reset to zero at the beginning of each RS.\n<gallery>\nFile:Established Route Point Sign.jpg|'''ERP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 3km)\nFile:Kilometre Marker Post Sign.jpg|'''KMP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 1km)\nFile:Route Station Marker Sign.jpg|'''RS Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 591)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Speed limits in New Zealand]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Traffic signs}}\n\n[[Category:Road transport in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Road signs by country|New Zealand]]\n", "name_user": "Fry1989", "label": "safe", "comment": "(GR)File renamed:File:New Zealand RG-34.svg\u2192File:New Zealand road sign R3-13.2.svgFile name standardisation.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_signs_in_New_Zealand"}
