The geographic center of [[Connecticut]] is located in the town.  Berlin is residential and industrial, and is served by the [[Amtrak]] [[railroad station|station]] [[Berlin station (Connecticut)|of the same name]]. Berlin also has two hamlets: [[Kensington, Connecticut|Kensington]] and [[East Berlin, Connecticut|East Berlin]].\n\n==Town seal==\nThe greatest boom to Berlin industry resulted from the decision of the Patterson brothers to start their business on West Street (now called Lower Lane). For twenty years until 1760, they kept their work in the family selling their wares from a basket. When demand increased they took apprentices into the shop and engaged peddlers to travel throughout the colonies selling the shiny, useful articles (the seal of the Town of Berlin shows such a \"Yankee peddler\" in eighteenth-century dress with a basket under his arm, a pack on his back full of tinware).  As others learned the trade, they soon set up shop and hired apprentices.  There were so many that the noise of the [[whitesmith]]s and their hammering could be heard in every part of town.\n\n==History==\nThe town took parts away from Wethersfield (Now Rocky Hill and Newington), Middletown (Now Cromwell), Wallingford (Now Meriden) and Farmington (Now Southington and New Britain). Berlin was one of the birthplaces of [[interchangeable parts]] manufacturing and of the [[industrial revolution]] in the United States, in the workshop of [[Simeon North]]. The town was formerly known as Kensington.\n\nIn 1659, Sergeant Richard Beckley purchased 300 acres from Chief Tarramuggus, built a home for his family and became the first settler in what was to become Berlin. Other families slowly followed, and in 1686, Captain Richard Seymour led a group of families from Farmington to begin the first settlement on Christian Lane.\n\nBy 1705, the first ecclesiastical society was recognized and the area renamed the Great Swamp Society. The first meetinghouse and cemetery were established a few years later, and the first school house built in 1717.\n\n1722 brought reorganization to the Society. Parts of the towns of Farmington, Wethersfield and Middletown were added to increase the land area, and the name changed to Kensington. In 1772, the Society was divided into an eastern half, called Worthington, and the western section, which retained the name of Kensington. 1785 brought incorporation of the town, which was then called Berlin. New Britain remained a part of Berlin until 1850.\n\nAround 1740, Edward and William Pattison, two brothers from Ireland, emigrated to Berlin and set up the first tinware business in the colonies. Wares in baskets were pedaled from house to house, then, as surplus accumulated, by mule and wagon, traveling all over America and to Canada. This was the birth of \"The Yankee Peddler\".\n\nDuring the years from 1700-1750, farms, mills, and blacksmiths sprang up through the Great Swamp. Most residents of this area were skilled in one or more of these trades, which were recognized and allowed by the British government. A blacksmith was crucial for daily living needs such as nails, tools, hinges, latches, hooks, cranes, cooking utensils, and parts for wagons, wheels and sleds. Small ironworks sprang up near local waterpower.\n\nIn addition to tinware, ammunition was made from the local lead mines during the Revolutionary War. East Berlin Milling Co. produced cotton and woolen yarn which was spun into clothing and blankets. Simeon North, manufacturer of pistols, became the first official pistol maker for the United States Government when he developed a system of interchangeable parts for pistols. In the 1800s, business of all sorts thrived in Berlin. Makers of wagons, tableware, hats, clocks, books, combs, woolen clothes and blankets, cabinet and coffin makers, sleighs, muffs, and suits, were all local industries. Berlin was on the direct route from New Haven to Hartford, with taverns and inns, which were regular stagecoach stops for fresh horses, meals and sleeping accommodations.\n\nTwo meetinghouses had been built, one in Kensington Parish, still in use today as the Kensington Congregational Church. The Worthington Meetinghouse was in continuous use as a church, town hall, school and town offices until 1974.\n\nBerlin was proud to have one of the 75 official post offices designated by Benjamin Franklin, first Postmaster General. A historic marker showing that the next post office was in Hartford, 11 miles away, is still located on Worthington Ridge.\n\nBy the late 1700s, a village library had been started, and the town boasted of five school districts. In the mid 1800s, the Worthington Academy was built, which ultimately housed 125 students from neighboring states. The Berlin Railroad Depot opened as a way station on the New York, New Haven and Hartford line. Today, this train station is one of the last places in the U.S. that sells tickets to anywhere in the U.S. or Canada.\n\nThe mid 1800s brought competition from mass-produced products, forcing the peddlers out of business. It also brought the establishment of the brick making industry locally, which eventually produced 90,000 bricks daily until the 1960s.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|69.9|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|68.2|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|1.7|km2|order=flip}}, or 2.45%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> The geographic center of Connecticut is located in Berlin.\n\nThe west side of Berlin is flanked by the [[Metacomet Ridge]], a mountainous [[trap rock]] ridgeline that stretches from [[Long Island Sound]] to nearly the [[Vermont]] border. Notable mountains of the Metacomet ridge in Berlin include the [[Hanging Hills]], [[Lamentation Mountain]], [[Short Mountain (Connecticut)|Short Mountain]], and [[Ragged Mountain (Connecticut)|Ragged Mountain]]. The {{convert|51|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Metacomet Trail]] and the {{convert|50|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Mattabesett Trail]] traverse the ridge.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1820= 2877\n|1840= 3411\n|1850= 1869\n|1860= 2146\n|1870= 2436\n|1880= 2385\n|1890= 2600\n|1900= 3448\n|1910= 3728\n|1920= 4298\n|1930= 4875\n|1940= 5230\n|1950= 7470\n|1960= 11250\n|1970= 14149\n|1980= 15121\n|1990= 16787\n|2000= 18215\n|2010= 19866\n|estyear=2014\n|estimate=20610\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2014\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2014/SUB-EST2014.html|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Incorporated Places: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2014|accessdate=June 4, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523034651/https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2014/SUB-EST2014.html|archive-date=May 23, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html |title=Census of Population and Housing |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=June 4, 2015 }}</ref>\n|1790=2465|1800=2702|1810=2798|1830=3037}}\n{{See also|List of Connecticut locations by per capita income}}\nAs of the 2010 census Berlin had a population of 19,866.

Adult education classes are held here as well as meetings for civic and student groups.\n\n==Pronunciation==\nAlthough taken from the name of the Prussian capital, [[Berlin]],<ref>{{cite book|title=The Connecticut Magazine: An Illustrated Monthly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qoEyAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA330|year=1903|publisher=Connecticut Magazine Company|page=330}}</ref> which receives the stress in its pronunciation on the second syllable, the name of the town in Connecticut has always received the stress in its pronunciation on the first syllable, in keeping with the [[recessive accent]] usual in the pronunciation of English.  Notwithstanding this history, an [[urban legend]] now current in some quarters claims that the emphasis was changed during the [[First World War]] to differentiate the little town from the German city.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Connecticut}}\n*[http://www.town.berlin.ct.us/ Town of Berlin official website]\n\n{{Geographic Location\n|Centre    = Berlin, Connecticut\n|North     = [[Newington, Connecticut|Newington]]\n|Northeast = [[Rocky Hill, Connecticut|Rocky Hill]]\n|East      = [[Cromwell, Connecticut|Cromwell]]\n|Southeast = [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]]\n|South     = [[Meriden, Connecticut|Meriden]]\n|Southwest = \n|West      = [[Southington, Connecticut|Southington]]\n|Northwest = [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]]\n}}\n\n{{Connecticut}}\n{{Hartford County, Connecticut}}\n{{Greater Hartford}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Berlin, Connecticut|*]]\n[[Category:Towns in Hartford County, Connecticut]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1785]]\n[[Category:Towns in Connecticut]]\n[[Category:Greater Hartford]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n| official_name          = Berlin, Connecticut\n| settlement_type        = [[New England town|Town]]\n| image_skyline          = Short mtn.jpg\n| image_caption          = Rural Berlin from [[Short Mountain (Connecticut)|Short Mountain]]\n| image_flag             = \n| image_seal             = BerlinCTseal.PNG\n| image_map              = Berlin CT lg.PNG\n| mapsize                = 250px\n| map_caption            = Location within [[Hartford County, Connecticut|Hartford County]], [[Connecticut]]\n| coordinates            = {{coord|41|36|50|N|72|46|21|W|region:US-CT|display=inline,title}}\n| subdivision_type        = [[Country]]\n| subdivision_name        = {{flag|United States}}\n| subdivision_type1       = [[U.S. state]]\n| subdivision_name1       = {{flag|Connecticut}}\n| subdivision_type2       = [[County (United States)|County]]\n| subdivision_name2       = [[Hartford County, Connecticut|Hartford]]\n| subdivision_type3       = Metropolitan area \n| subdivision_name3       = [[Greater Hartford|Hartford]]\n| parts_type              = Hamlets\n| parts                   = Berlin<br>[[East Berlin, Connecticut|East&nbsp;Berlin]]<br>[[Kensington, Connecticut|Kensington]]\n| established_title      = [[Municipal corporation|Incorporated]]\n| established_date       = 1785\n| government_type        = [[Council-manager]]\n| leader_title           = [[Town Manager]]\n| leader_name            = Denise McNair\n| leader_title1          = [[Mayor]]\n| leader_name1           = Mark Kaczynski (R)\n| unit_pref              = Imperial\n| area_total_km2         = 69.9\n| area_land_km2          = 68.2\n| area_water_km2         = 1.7\n| elevation_m            = 32\n| elevation_ft           = 105\n| population_total       = 19866\n| population_as_of       = 2010\n| population_footnotes   = <ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n| population_density_sq_mi = 735.8\n| postal_code_type       = ZIP code\n| postal_code            = 06023, 06037\n| area_code              = [[Area code 860|860]]\n| unemployment_rate = \n| website                = {{URL|www.town.berlin.ct.us}}\n| leader_title2          = [[Deputy Mayor]]\n| leader_name2           = Brenden T.

The geographic center of [[Connecticut]] is located in the town.  Berlin is residential and industrial, and is served by the [[Amtrak]] [[railroad station|station]] [[Berlin station (Connecticut)|of the same name]]. Berlin also has two hamlets: [[Kensington, Connecticut|Kensington]] and [[East Berlin, Connecticut|East Berlin]].\n\n==Town seal==\nThe greatest boom to Berlin industry resulted from the decision of the Patterson brothers to start their business on West Street (now called Lower Lane). For twenty years until 1760, they kept their work in the family selling their wares from a basket. When demand increased they took apprentices into the shop and engaged peddlers to travel throughout the colonies selling the shiny, useful articles (the seal of the Town of Berlin shows such a \"Yankee peddler\" in eighteenth-century dress with a basket under his arm, a pack on his back full of tinware).  As others learned the trade, they soon set up shop and hired apprentices.  There were so many that the noise of the [[whitesmith]]s and their hammering could be heard in every part of town.\n\n==History==\nThe town took parts away from Wethersfield (Now Rocky Hill and Newington), Middletown (Now Cromwell), Wallingford (Now Meriden) and Farmington (Now Southington and New Britain). Berlin was one of the birthplaces of [[interchangeable parts]] manufacturing and of the [[industrial revolution]] in the United States, in the workshop of [[Simeon North]]. The town was formerly known as Kensington.\n\nIn 1659, Sergeant Richard Beckley purchased 300 acres from Chief Tarramuggus, built a home for his family and became the first settler in what was to become Berlin. Other families slowly followed, and in 1686, Captain Richard Seymour led a group of families from Farmington to begin the first settlement on Christian Lane.\n\nBy 1705, the first ecclesiastical society was recognized and the area renamed the Great Swamp Society. The first meetinghouse and cemetery were established a few years later, and the first school house built in 1717.\n\n1722 brought reorganization to the Society. Parts of the towns of Farmington, Wethersfield and Middletown were added to increase the land area, and the name changed to Kensington. In 1772, the Society was divided into an eastern half, called Worthington, and the western section, which retained the name of Kensington. 1785 brought incorporation of the town, which was then called Berlin. New Britain remained a part of Berlin until 1850.\n\nAround 1740, Edward and William Pattison, two brothers from Ireland, emigrated to Berlin and set up the first tinware business in the colonies. Wares in baskets were pedaled from house to house, then, as surplus accumulated, by mule and wagon, traveling all over America and to Canada. This was the birth of \"The Yankee Peddler\".\n\nDuring the years from 1700-1750, farms, mills, and blacksmiths sprang up through the Great Swamp. Most residents of this area were skilled in one or more of these trades, which were recognized and allowed by the British government. A blacksmith was crucial for daily living needs such as nails, tools, hinges, latches, hooks, cranes, cooking utensils, and parts for wagons, wheels and sleds. Small ironworks sprang up near local waterpower.\n\nIn addition to tinware, ammunition was made from the local lead mines during the Revolutionary War. East Berlin Milling Co. produced cotton and woolen yarn which was spun into clothing and blankets. Simeon North, manufacturer of pistols, became the first official pistol maker for the United States Government when he developed a system of interchangeable parts for pistols. In the 1800s, business of all sorts thrived in Berlin. Makers of wagons, tableware, hats, clocks, books, combs, woolen clothes and blankets, cabinet and coffin makers, sleighs, muffs, and suits, were all local industries. Berlin was on the direct route from New Haven to Hartford, with taverns and inns, which were regular stagecoach stops for fresh horses, meals and sleeping accommodations.\n\nTwo meetinghouses had been built, one in Kensington Parish, still in use today as the Kensington Congregational Church. The Worthington Meetinghouse was in continuous use as a church, town hall, school and town offices until 1974.\n\nBerlin was proud to have one of the 75 official post offices designated by Benjamin Franklin, first Postmaster General. A historic marker showing that the next post office was in Hartford, 11 miles away, is still located on Worthington Ridge.\n\nBy the late 1700s, a village library had been started, and the town boasted of five school districts. In the mid 1800s, the Worthington Academy was built, which ultimately housed 125 students from neighboring states. The Berlin Railroad Depot opened as a way station on the New York, New Haven and Hartford line. Today, this train station is one of the last places in the U.S. that sells tickets to anywhere in the U.S. or Canada.\n\nThe mid 1800s brought competition from mass-produced products, forcing the peddlers out of business. It also brought the establishment of the brick making industry locally, which eventually produced 90,000 bricks daily until the 1960s.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|69.9|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|68.2|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|1.7|km2|order=flip}}, or 2.45%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> The geographic center of Connecticut is located in Berlin.\n\nThe west side of Berlin is flanked by the [[Metacomet Ridge]], a mountainous [[trap rock]] ridgeline that stretches from [[Long Island Sound]] to nearly the [[Vermont]] border. Notable mountains of the Metacomet ridge in Berlin include the [[Hanging Hills]], [[Lamentation Mountain]], [[Short Mountain (Connecticut)|Short Mountain]], and [[Ragged Mountain (Connecticut)|Ragged Mountain]]. The {{convert|51|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Metacomet Trail]] and the {{convert|50|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Mattabesett Trail]] traverse the ridge.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1820= 2877\n|1840= 3411\n|1850= 1869\n|1860= 2146\n|1870= 2436\n|1880= 2385\n|1890= 2600\n|1900= 3448\n|1910= 3728\n|1920= 4298\n|1930= 4875\n|1940= 5230\n|1950= 7470\n|1960= 11250\n|1970= 14149\n|1980= 15121\n|1990= 16787\n|2000= 18215\n|2010= 19866\n|estyear=2014\n|estimate=20610\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2014\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2014/SUB-EST2014.html|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Incorporated Places: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2014|accessdate=June 4, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523034651/https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2014/SUB-EST2014.html|archive-date=May 23, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html |title=Census of Population and Housing |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=June 4, 2015 }}</ref>\n|1790=2465|1800=2702|1810=2798|1830=3037}}\n{{See also|List of Connecticut locations by per capita income}}\nAs of the 2010 census Berlin had a population of 19,866.

The film is a sequel to the 2016 film ''[[Trolls (film)|Trolls]]'', directed by [[Walt Dohrn]] with co-direction by David P. Smith, produced by [[Gina Shay]], and written by [[Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger|Jonathan Aibel, Glenn Berger]], Elizabeth Tippet, [[Maya Forbes]] and [[Wallace Wolodarsky]], from a story by Aibel and Berger. The film stars [[Anna Kendrick]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Ron Funches]], [[James Corden]], [[Kunal Nayyar]], [[Kelly Clarkson]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Sam Rockwell]], [[Kenan Thompson]] and [[Rachel Bloom]].\n\n''Trolls World Tour'' was theatrically released in the United States on April 10, 2020. Due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]], the film was also released for [[video on demand|digital rental]] on the same day.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Plot|film|date=April 2020}}\nA celebration of the Techno Trolls is crashed by the [[Rock music|Rock Trolls]], led by evil Queen Barb. After Barb destroys his DJ station with her [[guitar]]'s power, King Trollex is forced to surrender the blue string that powers [[Techno]] music. \n\nPoppy, still adjusting to her new role as queen, receives a message from Barb that invites all Trolls to a party to unite their music. Her father reveals that there are different kinds of Trolls scattered through their land. The six primary tribes are each represented by a different style of music: [[Pop music|Pop]], [[Funk]]. [[Classical music|Classical]], [[Techno]], [[Country music|Country]], and [[Rock music|Rock]]. Each musical style being powered by a magical string kept by the leader of each tribe. Having separated their tribes following discord and disagreement over which style of music was the best, Poppy wants to help Barb unite the different forms of music, but both her father and Branch warn her not to trust Barb's intentions and to accept that the other Trolls are different. Poppy does not listen, and sends a cheerful reply to Barb via Debbie, Barb's pet bat.\n\nMeanwhile, Barb gloats over her victory of snatching the [[Techno]] string, revealing her plan to string an enchanted guitar with all six strings, and play a power chord strong enough to destroy all other music, replacing it with [[Rock music|rock]].\n\nWanting to prove herself as a good queen, Poppy travels via air balloon to recruit the other groups of Trolls, Branch joining her in an attempt to express his feelings towards her. Biggie accidentally stows aboard the balloon, and joins them. Meanwhile, Cooper, who feels like the black sheep among the Pop trolls, goes on a journey himself to find Trolls who look like him.\n\nThe balloon ends up in the land of [[Classical]] Trolls, which, to Poppy's horror, is in ruins. A single small [[flute]] named Pennywhistle tells Poppy their town had been decimated by Barb's armada, who captured all the citizens and stole the yellow Classical string. Poppy decides to now unite the other Trolls to stop Barb. Branch and Biggie both urge her to return home to protect the pink Pop string, but Poppy reveals it hidden in her hair. They then travel to the [[Country]] Trolls' land, but after introducing themselves with a loud medley of pop songs, are jailed by an offended Delta Dawn. A Country Troll named Hickory, who claims he is moved by Poppy's motives, breaks them out, leading to a chase to a ravine, where the group falls into a river. Branch does not trust Hickory, even when the Troll builds a raft to take the group downstream. The conversation is interrupted by Chaz, a [[Smooth Jazz]] Troll who was hired as a bounty hunter to catch Poppy for Barb, who was incredibly offended by Poppy's reply letter. Hickory incapacitates Chaz, but Biggie, disillusioned by Poppy's poor leadership, decides to return home. Shortly after, the group is abducted by a space ship wielding magical soap bubbles.\n\nInside the spaceship, the group meets the [[Funk]] Trolls, and meets up with Cooper, who is revealed to have been a long lost identical twin prince of Funk all along. Cooper tells Poppy he finds comfort in identifying with both [[Pop music|Pop]] and [[Funk]], and his parents, King Quincy and Queen Essence, reveal to Poppy that long ago the original [[Pop music|Pop]] Trolls had attempted to steal the strings and remix the other five music styles into Pop, forcing the other Trolls to each take one string and divide their tribes to save their music. Quincy explains to Poppy that differences are not bad, and trying to make all Trolls the same does not help the problem.\n\nAfter the Rock Trolls hijack the Funk Trolls' ship to steal the purple Funk String, Cooper ejects the group in bubbles, accidentally separating Hickory from the two. Branch and Poppy fight when Poppy refuses to return home to their friends, and Branch admonishes her insisting she cannot be a good queen if she is a poor listener, and the two go their separate ways, heartbroken. Branch is soon captured by both [[K-Pop]] and [[Reggaeton]] bounty hunters. However, he eventually convinces them to stop capturing and fighting and save Poppy and all music.\n\nPoppy reunites with Hickory, showing him the Pop string. Hickory urges her to return home, but suddenly is revealed to have been a [[Yodel]] Troll all along. He and another Yodel Troll, Dickory, had been hired to capture her for Barb, but Hickory had a change of heart. Before she can escape, Poppy is then captured personally by Barb, who takes possession of the sixth and final string. \n\nBiggie returns home and seeing it in shambles, feels remorse over abandoning Poppy. He gathers together their remaining friends to go rescue her and Branch, entering the land of the Rock Trolls.\n\nBarb has Poppy imprisoned over a large concert stage where all the captured Trolls are the audience, and admits she empathizes with Poppy's attempts to be a good queen, as she is trying to make rock supreme to prove her own leadership. Barb uses her enchanted guitar during the concert to turn Branch, and the leaders of the other lands into rock zombies. Poppy seemingly is transformed into a rock zombie when she falls onto the stage, but upon grabbing Barb's guitar, is revealed to have been wearing gumdrop earplugs. She admonishes Barb for being a poor queen by not taking time to listen to her people, and smashes the guitar. While it snaps the possessed trolls out of their rock zombie state, it destroys the strings, ending [[music]], and causing all the trolls to lose their colors, much to Barb\u2019s anguish.\n\nCooper hears his heartbeat over a microphone, and creates a rhythmic beat with it, other trolls joining in with clapping, stomping, and other forms of soundmaking, reviving the power of their music, and Poppy encourages everyone to [[sing]] together as their colors are restored. Realizing how important other forms of [[music]] are, and encouraged by her father Thrash, Barb joins in, regaining her colors, and eagerly accepts Poppy's offer of friendship. \n\nBranch is finally able to profess his love to Poppy who reciprocates his feelings, and everyone performs together, all Trolls finally reunited while celebrating their differences.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], Bridget and King Gristle arrive to the Pop Troll village, unaware of the events that have taken place, and worried they have missed the party.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Anna Kendrick]] as Queen Poppy, the optimistic Queen of the Pop Trolls and Branch's love interest.\n* [[Justin Timberlake]] as Branch, an over-cautious, good-hearted survivalist Pop Troll and Poppy's love interest.\n* [[Rachel Bloom]] as Queen Barb, the wild-hearted and evil Queen of the Hard Rock Trolls and Thrash's daughter.\n* [[James Corden]] as Biggie, a chubby, friendly pop Troll.\n* [[Ozzy Osbourne]] as King Thrash, former King of the Hard Rock Trolls, and Barb's semi-senile father.\n* [[Anderson Paak]] as Prince D, a Funk Troll who is Quincy and Essence's son and Cooper\u2019s twin brother.\n* [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] as King Quincy, the King of the Funk Trolls.\n* [[Mary J.

The film is a sequel to the 2016 film ''[[Trolls (film)|Trolls]]'', directed by [[Walt Dohrn]] with co-direction by David P. Smith, produced by [[Gina Shay]], and written by [[Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger|Jonathan Aibel, Glenn Berger]], Elizabeth Tippet, [[Maya Forbes]] and [[Wallace Wolodarsky]], from a story by Aibel and Berger. The film stars [[Anna Kendrick]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Ron Funches]], [[James Corden]], [[Kunal Nayyar]], [[Kelly Clarkson]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Sam Rockwell]], [[Kenan Thompson]] and [[Rachel Bloom]].\n\n''Trolls World Tour'' was theatrically released in the United States on April 10, 2020. Due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]], the film was also released for [[video on demand|digital rental]] on the same day.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Plot|film|date=April 2020}}\nA celebration of the Techno Trolls is crashed by the [[Rock music|Rock Trolls]], led by Queen Barb. After Barb destroys his DJ station with her [[guitar]]'s power, King Trollex is forced to surrender the blue string that powers [[Techno]] music. \n\nPoppy, still adjusting to her new role as queen, receives a message from Barb that invites all Trolls to a party to unite their music. Her father reveals that there are different kinds of Trolls scattered through their land. The six primary tribes are each represented by a different style of music: [[Pop music|Pop]], [[Funk]]. [[Classical music|Classical]], [[Techno]], [[Country music|Country]], and [[Rock music|Rock]]. Each musical style being powered by a magical string kept by the leader of each tribe. Having separated their tribes following discord and disagreement over which style of music was the best, Poppy wants to help Barb unite the different forms of music, but both her father and Branch warn her not to trust Barb's intentions and to accept that the other Trolls are different. Poppy does not listen, and sends a cheerful reply to Barb via Debbie, Barb's pet bat.\n\nMeanwhile, Barb gloats over her victory of snatching the [[Techno]] string, revealing her plan to string an enchanted guitar with all six strings, and play a power chord strong enough to destroy all other music, replacing it with [[Rock music|rock]].\n\nWanting to prove herself as a good queen, Poppy travels via air balloon to recruit the other groups of Trolls, Branch joining her in an attempt to express his feelings towards her. Biggie accidentally stows aboard the balloon, and joins them. Meanwhile, Cooper, who feels like the black sheep among the Pop trolls, goes on a journey himself to find Trolls who look like him.\n\nThe balloon ends up in the land of [[Classical]] Trolls, which, to Poppy's horror, is in ruins. A single small [[flute]] named Pennywhistle tells Poppy their town had been decimated by Barb's armada, who captured all the citizens and stole the yellow Classical string. Poppy decides to now unite the other Trolls to stop Barb. Branch and Biggie both urge her to return home to protect the pink Pop string, but Poppy reveals it hidden in her hair. They then travel to the [[Country]] Trolls' land, but after introducing themselves with a loud medley of pop songs, are jailed by an offended Delta Dawn. A Country Troll named Hickory, who claims he is moved by Poppy's motives, breaks them out, leading to a chase to a ravine, where the group falls into a river. Branch does not trust Hickory, even when the Troll builds a raft to take the group downstream. The conversation is interrupted by Chaz, a [[Smooth Jazz]] Troll who was hired as a bounty hunter to catch Poppy for Barb, who was incredibly offended by Poppy's reply letter. Hickory incapacitates Chaz, but Biggie, disillusioned by Poppy's poor leadership, decides to return home. Shortly after, the group is abducted by a space ship wielding magical soap bubbles.\n\nInside the spaceship, the group meets the [[Funk]] Trolls, and meets up with Cooper, who is revealed to have been a long lost identical twin prince of Funk all along. Cooper tells Poppy he finds comfort in identifying with both [[Pop music|Pop]] and [[Funk]], and his parents, King Quincy and Queen Essence, reveal to Poppy that long ago the original [[Pop music|Pop]] Trolls had attempted to steal the strings and remix the other five music styles into Pop, forcing the other Trolls to each take one string and divide their tribes to save their music. Quincy explains to Poppy that differences are not bad, and trying to make all Trolls the same does not help the problem.\n\nAfter the Rock Trolls hijack the Funk Trolls' ship to steal the purple Funk String, Cooper ejects the group in bubbles, accidentally separating Hickory from the two. Branch and Poppy fight when Poppy refuses to return home to their friends, and Branch admonishes her insisting she cannot be a good queen if she is a poor listener, and the two go their separate ways, heartbroken. Branch is soon captured by both [[K-Pop]] and [[Reggaeton]] bounty hunters. However, he eventually convinces them to stop capturing and fighting and save Poppy and all music.\n\nPoppy reunites with Hickory, showing him the Pop string. Hickory urges her to return home, but suddenly is revealed to have been a [[Yodel]] Troll all along. He and another Yodel Troll, Dickory, had been hired to capture her for Barb, but Hickory had a change of heart. Before she can escape, Poppy is then captured personally by Barb, who takes possession of the sixth and final string. \n\nBiggie returns home and seeing it in shambles, feels remorse over abandoning Poppy. He gathers together their remaining friends to go rescue her and Branch, entering the land of the Rock Trolls.\n\nBarb has Poppy imprisoned over a large concert stage where all the captured Trolls are the audience, and admits she empathizes with Poppy's attempts to be a good queen, as she is trying to make rock supreme to prove her own leadership. Barb uses her enchanted guitar during the concert to turn Branch, and the leaders of the other lands into rock zombies. Poppy seemingly is transformed into a rock zombie when she falls onto the stage, but upon grabbing Barb's guitar, is revealed to have been wearing gumdrop earplugs. She admonishes Barb for being a poor queen by not taking time to listen to her people, and smashes the guitar. While it snaps the possessed trolls out of their rock zombie state, it destroys the strings, ending [[music]], and causing all the trolls to lose their colors, much to Barb\u2019s anguish.\n\nCooper hears his heartbeat over a microphone, and creates a rhythmic beat with it, other trolls joining in with clapping, stomping, and other forms of soundmaking, reviving the power of their music, and Poppy encourages everyone to [[sing]] together as their colors are restored. Realizing how important other forms of [[music]] are, and encouraged by her father Thrash, Barb joins in, regaining her colors, and eagerly accepts Poppy's offer of friendship. \n\nBranch is finally able to profess his love to Poppy who reciprocates his feelings, and everyone performs together, all Trolls finally reunited while celebrating their differences.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], Bridget and King Gristle arrive to the Pop Troll village, unaware of the events that have taken place, and worried they have missed the party.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Anna Kendrick]] as Queen Poppy, the optimistic Queen of the Pop Trolls and Branch's love interest.\n* [[Justin Timberlake]] as Branch, an over-cautious, good-hearted survivalist Pop Troll and Poppy's love interest.\n* [[James Corden]] as Biggie, a chubby, friendly pop Troll.\n* [[Rachel Bloom]] as Queen Barb, the wild-hearted Queen of the Hard Rock Trolls and Thrash's daughter.\n* [[Ozzy Osbourne]] as King Thrash, former King of the Hard Rock Trolls, and Barb's semi-senile father.\n* [[Anderson Paak]] as Prince D, a Funk Troll who is Quincy and Essence's son and Cooper\u2019s twin brother.\n* [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] as King Quincy, the King of the Funk Trolls.\n* [[Mary J.
