The hierarchy represents the latter parts of the life-cycle for each product.\n\n===Life-cycle of a product===\nThe life-cycle begins with design, then proceeds through manufacture, distribution, and primary use and then follows through the waste hierarchy's stages of reduce, reuse and recycle.  Each stage in the life-cycle offers opportunities for policy intervention, to rethink the need for the product, to redesign to minimize waste potential, to extend its use.<ref name=UN/>{{page needed|date=November 2016}} Product life-cycle analysis is a way to optimize the use of the world's limited resources by avoiding the unnecessary generation of waste.\n\n===Resource efficiency===\n[[Resource efficiency]] reflects the understanding that global economic growth and development can not be sustained at current production and consumption patterns. Globally, humanity extracts more resources to produce goods than the planet can replenish.<ref name=UN/>{{page needed|date=November 2016}} Resource efficiency is the reduction of the environmental impact from the production and consumption of these goods, from final raw material extraction to last use and disposal.\n\n===Polluter-pays principle===\nThe [[polluter-pays principle]] mandates that the polluting party pays for the impact on the environment. With respect to waste management, this generally refers to the requirement for a waste generator to pay for appropriate disposal of the unrecoverable material.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/faqs/what-is-the-polluter-pays-principle/|title=What is the polluter pays principle?|last=|first=|website=LSE|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=7 February 2020|date=11 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of waste management}}\nThroughout most of history, the amount of [[waste]] generated by humans was insignificant due to low [[population density]] and low societal levels of the [[exploitation of natural resources]] as well as industrial since a few decades ago. Common waste produced during pre-modern times was mainly ashes and human [[biodegradable waste]], and these were released back into the ground locally, with minimum [[environmental degradation|environmental impact]]. Tools made out of [[wood]] or [[metal]] were generally reused or passed down through the generations.\n\nHowever, some civilizations do seem to have been more profligate in their waste output than others. In particular, the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] of [[Central America]] had a fixed monthly ritual, in which the people of the village would gather together and burn their rubbish in large dumps.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Barbalace |first=Roberta Crowell |url=http://environmentalchemistry.com/yogi/environmental/wastehistory.html |title=The History of Waste |publisher=EnvironmentalChemistry.com |date=2003-08-01 |accessdate=2013-12-09}}</ref>\n\n===Modern era===\n[[File:SirEdwinChadwick.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir [[Edwin Chadwick]]'s 1842 report ''The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population'' was influential in securing the passage of the first legislation aimed at waste clearance and disposal.]]\nFollowing the onset of [[industrial revolution|industrialisation]] and the sustained urban growth of large population centres in [[England]], the buildup of waste in the cities caused a rapid deterioration in levels of [[sanitation]] and the general quality of urban life.

The [[Metropolitan Board of Works]] was the first citywide authority that centralized sanitation regulation for the rapidly expanding city and the [[Public Health Act 1875]] made it compulsory for every household to deposit their weekly waste in \"moveable receptacles\" for disposal\u2014the first concept for a dust-bin.<ref name=\"NWRA\">{{cite web|last=National Waste & Recycling Association |url=http://www.environmentalistseveryday.org/publications-solid-waste-industry-research/information/history-of-solid-waste-management/early-america-industrial-revolution.php |title=History of Solid Waste Management |location= Washington, D.C. |accessdate=2013-12-09}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Manlove, Alliott furnace.jpg|thumb|left|[[Manlove, Alliott & Co.

In 1874, the first incinerator was built in [[Nottingham]] by [[Manlove, Alliott & Co.

In 1895, [[New York City]] became the first U.S. city with public-sector garbage management.<ref name=\"NWRA\"/>\n\nEarly [[garbage truck|garbage removal trucks]] were simply open bodied [[dump truck]]s pulled by a team of horses.

The [[Garwood Load Packer]] was the first truck in 1938, to incorporate a hydraulic compactor.\n\n==Waste handling and transport==\n{{main article|Waste collection vehicle|Waste collector|Waste sorting}}\n[[File:Bin.JPG|right|thumb|upright|Moulded plastic, wheeled waste bin in [[Berkshire]], England]]\n\nWaste collection methods vary widely among different countries and regions. Domestic waste collection services are often provided by local government authorities, or by private companies for industrial and commercial waste. Some areas, especially those in less developed countries, do not have formal waste-collection systems.\n\n===Waste handling practices===\n[[Curbside collection]] is the most common method of disposal in most European countries, [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[United States]], and many other parts of the developed world in which waste is collected at regular intervals by specialised trucks. This is often associated with curb-side waste segregation. In rural areas waste may need to be taken to a transfer station. Waste collected is then transported to an appropriate disposal facility.\nIn some areas, vacuum collection is used in which waste is transported from the home or commercial premises by vacuum along small bore tubes. Systems are in use in Europe and North America.\n{{main article|Automated vacuum collection}}\nIn some jurisdictions unsegregated waste is collected at the curb-side or from waste transfer stations and then sorted into recyclables and unusable waste. Such systems are capable of sorting large volumes of solid waste, salvaging recyclables, and turning the rest into bio-gas and soil conditioner.\nIn [[San Francisco]], the local government established its ''Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance'' in support of its goal of \"Zero waste by 2020\", requiring everyone in the city to keep recyclables and compostables out of the landfill. The three streams are collected with the curbside \"Fantastic 3\" bin system \u2013 blue for recyclables, green for compostables, and black for landfill-bound materials \u2013 provided to residents and businesses and serviced by San Francisco's sole refuse hauler, Recology. The City's \"Pay-As-You-Throw\" system charges customers by the volume of landfill-bound materials, which provides a financial incentive to separate recyclables and compostables from other discards. The City's Department of the Environment's Zero Waste Program has led the City to achieve 80% diversion, the highest diversion rate in North America.<ref>http://www.siemens.com/entry/cc/features/greencityindex_international/all/en/pdf/report_northamerica_en.pdf</ref> Other businesses such as [[Waste Industries]] use a variety of colors to distinguish between trash and recycling cans.\n\n==Financial models==\nIn most developed countries, domestic waste disposal is funded from a national or local tax which may be related to income, or property values. Commercial and industrial waste disposal is typically charged for as a commercial service, often as an integrated charge which includes disposal costs. This practice may encourage disposal contractors to opt for the cheapest disposal option such as landfill rather than the environmentally best solution such as re-use and recycling.\n\nIn some areas such as [[Taipei]], the city government charges its households and industries for the volume of rubbish they produce. Waste is collected by the city council only if it is put in government issued rubbish bags. This policy has successfully reduced the amount of waste the city produces and increased the recycling rate.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n[[Morocco]] has also seen benefits from implementing a $300 million sanitary [[landfill]] system. While it might appear to be a costly investment, the country's government predicts that it has saved them another $440 million in damages, or consequences of failing to dispose of waste properly.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/09/27/how-the-world-should-cope-with-its-growing-piles-of-rubbish|title=How the world should cope with its growing piles of rubbish|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Disposal methods==\n\n===Landfill===\n{{main article|Landfill}}\n[[File:Landfill compactor.jpg|thumb|A [[Waste compaction|landfill compaction vehicle]] in action.]]\n[[File:District heating plant spittelau ssw crop1.png|thumb|upright|Spittelau incineration plant in [[Vienna]]]]\n\nA landfill is a site for the disposal of [[waste]] materials by burial. Landfill is the oldest form of [[list of solid waste treatment technologies|waste treatment]], although the burial of the waste is modern; historically, refuse was simply left in piles or thrown into pits. Historically, landfills have been the most common method of organized [[waste disposal]] and remain so in many places around the world.\n\n===Incineration===\n{{main article|Incineration}}\nIncineration is a disposal method in which solid organic wastes are subjected to combustion so as to convert them into residue and gaseous products. This method is useful for disposal of both municipal solid waste and solid residue from waste water treatment. This process reduces the volumes of solid waste by 80 to 95 percent.<ref>http://web.mit.edu/urbanupgrading/urbanenvironment/resources/references/pdfs/DecisionMakers.pdf</ref> Incineration and other high temperature waste treatment systems are sometimes described as \"[[thermal treatment]]\". Incinerators convert waste materials into [[heat]], [[gas]], [[steam]], and [[Incineration#Solid outputs|ash]].\n\nIncineration is carried out both on a small scale by individuals and on a large scale by industry. It is used to dispose of solid, liquid and gaseous waste. It is recognized as a practical method of disposing of certain [[hazardous waste]] materials (such as biological [[medical waste]]). Incineration is a controversial method of waste disposal, due to issues such as emission of gaseous [[pollutants]].\n\nIncineration is common in countries such as [[Japan]] where land is more scarce, as the facilities generally do not require as much area as landfills. [[Waste-to-energy]] (WtE) or energy-from-waste (EfW) are broad terms for facilities that burn waste in a furnace or boiler to generate heat, steam or electricity. Combustion in an incinerator is not always perfect and there have been concerns about pollutants in gaseous emissions from incinerator stacks. Particular concern has focused on some very persistent [[organic compound]]s such as [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]], [[furan]]s, and [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|PAH]]s, which may be created and which may have serious environmental consequences.\n\n==Recycling==\n{{main article|Recycling}}\n[[File:Sign. Mahabalipuram.jpg|thumb|Waste not the Waste. Sign in [[Tamil Nadu]], India]]\n[[File:Steel recycling bales.jpg|thumb|Steel crushed and baled for recycling]]\nRecycling is a [[resource recovery]] practice that refers to the collection and reuse of waste materials such as empty beverage containers. The materials from which the items are made can be reprocessed into new products. Material for recycling may be collected separately from general waste using dedicated bins and collection vehicles, a procedure called [[kerbside collection]]. In some communities, the owner of the waste is required to separate the materials into different bins (e.g. for paper, plastics, metals) prior to its collection. In other communities, all recyclable materials are placed in a single bin for collection, and the sorting is handled later at a central facility. The latter method is known as \"[[single-stream recycling]].\"<ref>City of Chicago, Illinois. Department of Streets and Sanitation.

These items are usually composed of a single type of material, making them relatively easy to recycle into new products. The recycling of complex products (such as computers and electronic equipment) is more difficult, due to the additional dismantling and separation required.\n\nThe type of  material accepted for recycling varies by city and country. Each city and country has different recycling programs in place that can handle the various types of recyclable materials.  However, certain variation in acceptance is reflected in the resale value of the material once it is reprocessed. In July 2017, the Chinese government announced an import ban of 24 categories of recyclables and solid waste, including plastic, textiles and mixed paper, placing tremendous impact on developed countries globally, which exported directly or indirectly to China.<ref>Walker, T. R. (2018). China's ban on imported plastic waste could be a game changer. Nature, 553(7689), 405-405.</ref>\n\n==Re-use==\n\n===Biological reprocessing===\n{{main article|Composting|Home composting|Anaerobic digestion|Microbial fuel cell}}\n[[File:Compost Heap.jpg|thumb|An active [[compost]] heap.]]\nRecoverable materials that are organic in nature, such as [[Green waste|plant material]], food scraps, and paper products, can be recovered through [[composting]] and digestion processes to [[decompose]] the organic matter. The resulting organic material is then recycled as [[mulch]] or [[compost]] for agricultural or landscaping purposes. In addition, waste gas from the process (such as methane) can be captured and used for generating electricity and heat (CHP/cogeneration) maximising efficiencies. The intention of biological processing in waste management is to control and accelerate the natural process of decomposition of organic matter. (See [[resource recovery]]).\n\n===Energy recovery===\n{{main article|Waste-to-energy}}\nEnergy recovery from waste is the conversion of non-recyclable waste materials into usable heat, electricity, or fuel through a variety of processes, including combustion, gasification, pyrolyzation, anaerobic digestion, and [[landfill gas]] recovery.<ref name=USEPA>{{cite web|publisher=USEPA |year=2014 |title=Energy Recovery from Waste |url=http://www.epa.gov/waste/nonhaz/municipal/wte/}}</ref> This process is often called waste-to-energy. Energy recovery from waste is part of the non-hazardous waste management hierarchy. Using energy recovery to convert non-recyclable waste materials into electricity and heat, generates a renewable energy source and can reduce carbon emissions by offsetting the need for energy from fossil sources as well as reduce methane generation from landfills.<ref name=USEPA/> Globally, waste-to-energy accounts for 16% of waste management.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=New Energy Corporation |year=2014 |title=Waste Hierarchy|url=http://www.newenergycorp.com.au/what-we-do/waste-hierarchy/}}</ref>\n\nThe energy content of waste products can be harnessed directly by using them as a direct combustion fuel, or indirectly by processing them into another type of fuel. Thermal treatment ranges from using waste as a fuel source for cooking or heating and the use of the gas fuel (see above), to fuel for [[boilers]] to generate steam and electricity in a [[turbine]]. [[Pyrolysis]] and [[gasification]] are two related forms of thermal treatment where waste materials are heated to high temperatures with limited [[oxygen]] availability. The process usually occurs in a sealed vessel under high [[pressure]]. Pyrolysis of solid waste converts the material into solid, liquid and gas products. The liquid and gas can be burnt to produce energy or refined into other chemical products (chemical refinery). The solid residue (char) can be further refined into products such as [[activated carbon]]. Gasification and advanced [[Plasma arc gasification]] are used to convert organic materials directly into a synthetic gas ([[syngas]]) composed of [[carbon monoxide]] and [[hydrogen]]. The gas is then burnt to produce electricity and [[steam]].\nAn alternative to pyrolysis is high temperature and pressure supercritical water decomposition (hydrothermal monophasic oxidation).\n\n===Pyrolysis===\n{{main article|Pyrolysis}}\nPyrolysis is often used to convert many types of domestic and industrial residues into a recovered fuel. Different types of waste input (such as plant waste, food waste, tyres) placed in the pyrolysis process potentially yield an alternative to fossil fuels.<ref name=TSEP>{{cite journal |date=September 2017 |title= Potential of pyrolysis processes in the waste management sector | journal=Thermal Science and Engineering Progress |volume=3 | pages=171\u2013197 |doi=10.1016/j.tsep.2017.06.003 | last1 = Czajczy\u0144ska | first1 = D. | last2 = Anguilano | first2 = L. | last3 = Ghazal | first3 = H. | last4 = Krzy\u017cy\u0144ska | first4 = R. | last5 = Reynolds | first5 = A.J. | last6 = Spencer | first6 = N. | last7 = Jouhara | first7 = H.}}</ref> Pyrolysis is a process of thermo-chemical decomposition of organic materials by heat in the absence of stoichiometric quantities of [[oxygen]]; the decomposition produces various hydrocarbon gases.<ref>Oxford Reference \u2013 Pyrolysis</ref> During pyrolysis, the molecules of object vibrate at high frequencies to an extent that molecules start breaking down.

Pyrolysis of waste wood and plastics can potentially produce fuel. The solids left from pyrolysis contain metals, glass, sand and pyrolysis coke which does not convert to gas.  Compared to the process of incineration, certain types of pyrolysis processes release less harmful by-products that contain alkali metals, sulphur, and chlorine. However, pyrolysis of some waste yields gasses which impact the environment such as HCl and SO<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=WMJ>{{cite journal |date=December 2014 |title= Pyrolysis technologies for municipal solid waste: A review| journal=Waste Management |volume=34 |issue=12 | pages=2466\u20132486 |doi=10.1016/j.wasman.2014.08.004 |pmid= 25256662| last1 = Chen | first1 = Dezhen | last2 = Yin | first2 = Lijie | last3 = Wang | first3 = Huan | last4 = He | first4 = Pinjing}}</ref>\n\n===Resource recovery===\n{{main article|Resource recovery}}\nResource recovery is the systematic diversion of waste, which was intended for disposal, for a specific next use.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=USEPA |year=2012 |title=Frequent Questions |url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/wastemin/minimize/faqs.htm}}</ref> It is the processing of recyclables to extract or recover materials and resources, or convert to energy.<ref name=Montana>{{cite web |publisher=Government of Montana |year=2012 |title=Resource Recovery |url=http://deq.mt.gov/solidwaste/resourcerecovery.mcpx}}</ref> These activities are performed at a resource recovery facility.<ref name=Montana/> Resource recovery is not only environmentally important, but it is also cost-effective.<ref name=traverse>{{cite web |publisher=Grand Traverse County |year=2006 |title=What is Resource Recovery? |url=http://www.co.grand-traverse.mi.us/departments/resource_recovery/What_is_Resource_Recovery_.htm}}</ref> It decreases the amount of waste for disposal, saves space in landfills, and conserves natural resources.<ref name=traverse/>\n\nResource recovery (as opposed to waste management) uses LCA (life cycle analysis) attempts to offer alternatives to waste management. For mixed MSW (Municipal Solid Waste) a number of broad studies have indicated that administration, source separation and collection followed by reuse and recycling of the non-organic fraction and energy and compost/fertilizer production of the organic material via anaerobic digestion to be the favoured path.\n\nAs an example of how resource recycling can be beneficial, many items thrown away contain metals that can be recycled to create a profit, such as the components in circuit boards.  Wood chippings in pallets and other packaging materials can be recycled to useful products for horticulture. The recycled chips can cover paths, walkways, or arena surfaces.\n\nApplication of rational and consistent waste management practices can yield a range of benefits including:\n# Economic \u2013 Improving economic efficiency through the means of resource use, treatment and disposal and creating markets for recycles can lead to efficient practices in the production and consumption of products and materials resulting in valuable materials being recovered for reuse and the potential for new jobs and new business opportunities.\n# Social \u2013 By reducing adverse impacts on health by proper waste management practises, the resulting consequences are more appealing civic communities.

The standard encourages companies to improve their environmental efficiencies each year by eliminating waste through [[resource recovery]] practices. One way to do this is by adopting resource recovery practices like [[recycling]] materials such as glass, food scraps, paper and cardboard, [[plastic bottle]]s and metal.  Recycled materials can often be sold to the [[construction industry]]. Many inorganic waste streams can be used to produce materials for construction. Concrete and bricks can be recycled as artificial gravel.

The hierarchy represents the latter parts of the life-cycle for each product.\n\n===Life-cycle of a product===\nThe life-cycle begins with design, then proceeds through manufacture, distribution, and primary use and then follows through the waste hierarchy's stages of reduce, reuse and recycle.  Each stage in the life-cycle offers opportunities for policy intervention, to rethink the need for the product, to redesign to minimize waste potential, to extend its use.<ref name=UN/>{{page needed|date=November 2016}} Product life-cycle analysis is a way to optimize the use of the world's limited resources by avoiding the unnecessary generation of waste.\n\n===Resource efficiency===\n[[Resource efficiency]] reflects the understanding that global economic growth and development can not be sustained at current production and consumption patterns.

Common waste produced during pre-modern times was mainly ashes and human [[biodegradable waste]], and these were released back into the ground locally, with minimum [[environmental degradation|environmental impact]]. Tools made out of [[wood]] or [[metal]] were generally reused or passed down through the generations.\n\nHowever, some civilizations do seem to have been more profligate in their waste output than others. In particular, the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] of [[Central America]] had a fixed monthly ritual, in which the people of the village would gather together and burn their rubbish in large dumps.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Barbalace |first=Roberta Crowell |url=http://environmentalchemistry.com/yogi/environmental/wastehistory.html |title=The History of Waste |publisher=EnvironmentalChemistry.com |date=2003-08-01 |accessdate=2013-12-09}}</ref>\n\n===Modern era===\n[[File:SirEdwinChadwick.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir [[Edwin Chadwick]]'s 1842 report ''The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population'' was influential in securing the passage of the first legislation aimed at waste clearance and disposal.]]\nFollowing the onset of [[industrial revolution|industrialisation]] and the sustained urban growth of large population centres in [[England]], the buildup of waste in the cities caused a rapid deterioration in levels of [[sanitation]] and the general quality of urban life.

The [[Garwood Load Packer]] was the first truck in 1938, to incorporate a hydraulic compactor.\n\n==Waste handling and transport==\n{{main article|Waste collection vehicle|Waste collector|Waste sorting}}\n[[File:Bin.JPG|right|thumb|upright|Moulded plastic, wheeled waste bin in [[Berkshire]], England]]\n\nWaste collection methods vary widely among different countries and regions. Domestic waste collection services are often provided by local government authorities, or by private companies for industrial and commercial waste. Some areas, especially those in less developed countries, do not have formal waste-collection systems.\n\n===Waste handling practices===\n[[Curbside collection]] is the most common method of disposal in most European countries, [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[United States]], and many other parts of the developed world in which waste is collected at regular intervals by specialised trucks. This is often associated with curb-side waste segregation. In rural areas waste may need to be taken to a transfer station. Waste collected is then transported to an appropriate disposal facility.\nIn some areas, vacuum collection is used in which waste is transported from the home or commercial premises by vacuum along small bore tubes. Systems are in use in Europe and North America.\n{{main article|Automated vacuum collection}}\nIn some jurisdictions unsegregated waste is collected at the curb-side or from waste transfer stations and then sorted into recyclables and unusable waste. Such systems are capable of sorting large volumes of solid waste, salvaging recyclables, and turning the rest into bio-gas and soil conditioner.\nIn [[San Francisco]], the local government established its ''Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance'' in support of its goal of \"Zero waste by 2020\", requiring everyone in the city to keep recyclables and compostables out of the landfill. The three streams are collected with the curbside \"Fantastic 3\" bin system \u2013 blue for recyclables, green for compostables, and black for landfill-bound materials \u2013 provided to residents and businesses and serviced by San Francisco's sole refuse hauler, Recology. The City's \"Pay-As-You-Throw\" system charges customers by the volume of landfill-bound materials, which provides a financial incentive to separate recyclables and compostables from other discards. The City's Department of the Environment's Zero Waste Program has led the City to achieve 80% diversion, the highest diversion rate in North America.<ref>http://www.siemens.com/entry/cc/features/greencityindex_international/all/en/pdf/report_northamerica_en.pdf</ref> Other businesses such as [[Waste Industries]] use a variety of colors to distinguish between trash and recycling cans.\n\n==Financial models==\nIn most developed countries, domestic waste disposal is funded from a national or local tax which may be related to income, or property values. Commercial and industrial waste disposal is typically charged for as a commercial service, often as an integrated charge which includes disposal costs. This practice may encourage disposal contractors to opt for the cheapest disposal option such as landfill rather than the environmentally best solution such as re-use and recycling.\n\nIn some areas such as [[Taipei]], the city government charges its households and industries for the volume of rubbish they produce. Waste is collected by the city council only if it is put in government issued rubbish bags. This policy has successfully reduced the amount of waste the city produces and increased the recycling rate.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n[[Morocco]] has also seen benefits from implementing a $300 million sanitary [[landfill]] system. While it might appear to be a costly investment, the country's government predicts that it has saved them another $440 million in damages, or consequences of failing to dispose of waste properly.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/09/27/how-the-world-should-cope-with-its-growing-piles-of-rubbish|title=How the world should cope with its growing piles of rubbish|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Disposal methods==\n\n===Landfill===\n{{main article|Landfill}}\n[[File:Landfill compactor.jpg|thumb|A [[Waste compaction|landfill compaction vehicle]] in action.]]\n[[File:District heating plant spittelau ssw crop1.png|thumb|upright|Spittelau incineration plant in [[Vienna]]]]\n\nA landfill is a site for the disposal of [[waste]] materials by burial. Landfill is the oldest form of [[list of solid waste treatment technologies|waste treatment]], although the burial of the waste is modern; historically, refuse was simply left in piles or thrown into pits. Historically, landfills have been the most common method of organized [[waste disposal]] and remain so in many places around the world.\n\n===Incineration===\n{{main article|Incineration}}\nIncineration is a disposal method in which solid organic wastes are subjected to combustion so as to convert them into residue and gaseous products. This method is useful for disposal of both municipal solid waste and solid residue from waste water treatment. This process reduces the volumes of solid waste by 80 to 95 percent.<ref>http://web.mit.edu/urbanupgrading/urbanenvironment/resources/references/pdfs/DecisionMakers.pdf</ref> Incineration and other high temperature waste treatment systems are sometimes described as \"[[thermal treatment]]\". Incinerators convert waste materials into [[heat]], [[gas]], [[steam]], and [[Incineration#Solid outputs|ash]].\n\nIncineration is carried out both on a small scale by individuals and on a large scale by industry. It is used to dispose of solid, liquid and gaseous waste. It is recognized as a practical method of disposing of certain [[hazardous waste]] materials (such as biological [[medical waste]]). Incineration is a controversial method of waste disposal, due to issues such as emission of gaseous [[pollutants]].\n\nIncineration is common in countries such as [[Japan]] where land is more scarce, as the facilities generally do not require as much area as landfills. [[Waste-to-energy]] (WtE) or energy-from-waste (EfW) are broad terms for facilities that burn waste in a furnace or boiler to generate heat, steam or electricity. Combustion in an incinerator is not always perfect and there have been concerns about pollutants in gaseous emissions from incinerator stacks. Particular concern has focused on some very persistent [[organic compound]]s such as [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]], [[furan]]s, and [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|PAH]]s, which may be created and which may have serious environmental consequences.\n\n==Recycling==\n{{main article|Recycling}}\n[[File:Sign. Mahabalipuram.jpg|thumb|Waste not the Waste. Sign in [[Tamil Nadu]], India]]\n[[File:Steel recycling bales.jpg|thumb|Steel crushed and baled for recycling]]\nRecycling is a [[resource recovery]] practice that refers to the collection and reuse of waste materials such as empty beverage containers. The materials from which the items are made can be reprocessed into new products. Material for recycling may be collected separately from general waste using dedicated bins and collection vehicles, a procedure called [[kerbside collection]]. In some communities, the owner of the waste is required to separate the materials into different bins (e.g. for paper, plastics, metals) prior to its collection. In other communities, all recyclable materials are placed in a single bin for collection, and the sorting is handled later at a central facility. The latter method is known as \"[[single-stream recycling]].\"<ref>City of Chicago, Illinois. Department of Streets and Sanitation.

These items are usually composed of a single type of material, making them relatively easy to recycle into new products. The recycling of complex products (such as computers and electronic equipment) is more difficult, due to the additional dismantling and separation required.\n\nThe type of  material accepted for recycling varies by city and country. Each city and country has different recycling programs in place that can handle the various types of recyclable materials.  However, certain variation in acceptance is reflected in the resale value of the material once it is reprocessed. In July 2017, the Chinese government announced an import ban of 24 categories of recyclables and solid waste, including plastic, textiles and mixed paper, placing tremendous impact on developed countries globally, which exported directly or indirectly to China.<ref>Walker, T. R. (2018). China's ban on imported plastic waste could be a game changer. Nature, 553(7689), 405-405.</ref>\n\n==Re-use==\n\n===Biological reprocessing===\n{{main article|Composting|Home composting|Anaerobic digestion|Microbial fuel cell}}\n[[File:Compost Heap.jpg|thumb|An active [[compost]] heap.]]\nRecoverable materials that are organic in nature, such as [[Green waste|plant material]], food scraps, and paper products, can be recovered through [[composting]] and digestion processes to [[decompose]] the organic matter. The resulting organic material is then recycled as [[mulch]] or [[compost]] for agricultural or landscaping purposes. In addition, waste gas from the process (such as methane) can be captured and used for generating electricity and heat (CHP/cogeneration) maximising efficiencies. The intention of biological processing in waste management is to control and accelerate the natural process of decomposition of organic matter. (See [[resource recovery]]).\n\n===Energy recovery===\n{{main article|Waste-to-energy}}\nEnergy recovery from waste is the conversion of non-recyclable waste materials into usable heat, electricity, or fuel through a variety of processes, including combustion, gasification, pyrolyzation, anaerobic digestion, and [[landfill gas]] recovery.<ref name=USEPA>{{cite web|publisher=USEPA |year=2014 |title=Energy Recovery from Waste |url=http://www.epa.gov/waste/nonhaz/municipal/wte/}}</ref> This process is often called waste-to-energy. Energy recovery from waste is part of the non-hazardous waste management hierarchy. Using energy recovery to convert non-recyclable waste materials into electricity and heat, generates a renewable energy source and can reduce carbon emissions by offsetting the need for energy from fossil sources as well as reduce methane generation from landfills.<ref name=USEPA/> Globally, waste-to-energy accounts for 16% of waste management.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=New Energy Corporation |year=2014 |title=Waste Hierarchy|url=http://www.newenergycorp.com.au/what-we-do/waste-hierarchy/}}</ref>\n\nThe energy content of waste products can be harnessed directly by using them as a direct combustion fuel, or indirectly by processing them into another type of fuel. Thermal treatment ranges from using waste as a fuel source for cooking or heating and the use of the gas fuel (see above), to fuel for [[boilers]] to generate steam and electricity in a [[turbine]]. [[Pyrolysis]] and [[gasification]] are two related forms of thermal treatment where waste materials are heated to high temperatures with limited [[oxygen]] availability. The process usually occurs in a sealed vessel under high [[pressure]]. Pyrolysis of solid waste converts the material into solid, liquid and gas products. The liquid and gas can be burnt to produce energy or refined into other chemical products (chemical refinery). The solid residue (char) can be further refined into products such as [[activated carbon]]. Gasification and advanced [[Plasma arc gasification]] are used to convert organic materials directly into a synthetic gas ([[syngas]]) composed of [[carbon monoxide]] and [[hydrogen]]. The gas is then burnt to produce electricity and [[steam]].\nAn alternative to pyrolysis is high temperature and pressure supercritical water decomposition (hydrothermal monophasic oxidation).\n\n===Pyrolysis===\n{{main article|Pyrolysis}}\nPyrolysis is often used to convert many types of domestic and industrial residues into a recovered fuel.

Pyrolysis of waste wood and plastics can potentially produce fuel. The solids left from pyrolysis contain metals, glass, sand and pyrolysis coke which does not convert to gas.  Compared to the process of incineration, certain types of pyrolysis processes release less harmful by-products that contain alkali metals, sulphur, and chlorine. However, pyrolysis of some waste yields gasses which impact the environment such as HCl and SO<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=WMJ>{{cite journal |date=December 2014 |title= Pyrolysis technologies for municipal solid waste: A review| journal=Waste Management |volume=34 |issue=12 | pages=2466\u20132486 |doi=10.1016/j.wasman.2014.08.004 |pmid= 25256662| last1 = Chen | first1 = Dezhen | last2 = Yin | first2 = Lijie | last3 = Wang | first3 = Huan | last4 = He | first4 = Pinjing}}</ref>\n\n===Resource recovery===\n{{main article|Resource recovery}}\nResource recovery is the systematic diversion of waste, which was intended for disposal, for a specific next use.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=USEPA |year=2012 |title=Frequent Questions |url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/wastemin/minimize/faqs.htm}}</ref> It is the processing of recyclables to extract or recover materials and resources, or convert to energy.<ref name=Montana>{{cite web |publisher=Government of Montana |year=2012 |title=Resource Recovery |url=http://deq.mt.gov/solidwaste/resourcerecovery.mcpx}}</ref> These activities are performed at a resource recovery facility.<ref name=Montana/> Resource recovery is not only environmentally important, but it is also cost-effective.<ref name=traverse>{{cite web |publisher=Grand Traverse County |year=2006 |title=What is Resource Recovery? |url=http://www.co.grand-traverse.mi.us/departments/resource_recovery/What_is_Resource_Recovery_.htm}}</ref> It decreases the amount of waste for disposal, saves space in landfills, and conserves natural resources.<ref name=traverse/>\n\nResource recovery (as opposed to waste management) uses LCA (life cycle analysis) attempts to offer alternatives to waste management. For mixed MSW (Municipal Solid Waste) a number of broad studies have indicated that administration, source separation and collection followed by reuse and recycling of the non-organic fraction and energy and compost/fertilizer production of the organic material via anaerobic digestion to be the favoured path.\n\nAs an example of how resource recycling can be beneficial, many items thrown away contain metals that can be recycled to create a profit, such as the components in circuit boards.  Wood chippings in pallets and other packaging materials can be recycled to useful products for horticulture. The recycled chips can cover paths, walkways, or arena surfaces.\n\nApplication of rational and consistent waste management practices can yield a range of benefits including:\n# Economic \u2013 Improving economic efficiency through the means of resource use, treatment and disposal and creating markets for recycles can lead to efficient practices in the production and consumption of products and materials resulting in valuable materials being recovered for reuse and the potential for new jobs and new business opportunities.\n# Social \u2013 By reducing adverse impacts on health by proper waste management practises, the resulting consequences are more appealing civic communities.  Better social advantages can lead to new sources of employment and potentially lifting communities out of poverty especially in some of the developing poorer countries and cities.\n# Environmental \u2013 Reducing or eliminating adverse impacts on the environment through reducing, reusing and recycling, and minimizing resource extraction can result in improved air and water quality and help in the reduction of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.\n# Inter-generational Equity \u2013 Following effective waste management practises can provide subsequent generations a more robust economy, a fairer and more [[social inclusion|inclusive society]] and a cleaner environment.<ref name=UN/>{{page needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Sustainability===\nThe management of waste is a key component in a business' ability to maintain [[ISO14001]] accreditation. The standard encourages companies to improve their environmental efficiencies each year by eliminating waste through [[resource recovery]] practices. One way to do this is by adopting resource recovery practices like [[recycling]] materials such as glass, food scraps, paper and cardboard, [[plastic bottle]]s and metal.  Recycled materials can often be sold to the [[construction industry]]. Many inorganic waste streams can be used to produce materials for construction. Concrete and bricks can be recycled as artificial gravel.

It can describe a mixed ethnic community area where multiple cultural traditions exist (such as [[New York City]]) or a single country within which they do (such as Switzerland, Belgium or Russia). Groups associated with an indigenous or [[wikt:autochthonous|autochthonous]] ethnic group and foreigner ethnic groups are often the focus.\n\nIn reference to sociology, multiculturalism is the end-state of either a natural or artificial process (for example: legally-controlled [[immigration]]) and occurs on either a large national scale or on a smaller scale within a nation's communities. On a smaller scale this can occur artificially when a jurisdiction is established or expanded by amalgamating areas with two or more different cultures (e.g. [[French Canada]] and [[English Canada]]). On a large scale, it can occur as a result of either legal or illegal [[human migration|migration]] to and from different jurisdictions around the world (for example, [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]] by Angles, Saxons and Jutes in the 5th century or the colonization of the Americas by Europeans, Africans and Asians since the 16th century). \n\nIn reference to political science, Multiculturalism can be defined as a states capacity to effectively and efficiently deal with cultural plurality within its sovereign borders.

It is also a matter of economic interests and [[Power (social and political)|political power]].<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/multiculturalism/ Multiculturalism] \u2013 Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</ref> In more recent times political multiculturalist ideologies have been expanding in their use to include and define disadvantaged groups such as [[African American]]s, [[LGBT]], with arguments often focusing on ethnic and religious minorities, minority nations, [[indigenous peoples]] and even the disabled. It is within this context in which the term is most commonly understood and the broadness and scope of the definition, as well as its practical use, has been the subject of serious debate.\n\nMost debates over multiculturalism center around whether or not multiculturalism is the appropriate way to deal with diversity and immigrant integration. The arguments regarding the perceived rights to a multicultural education include the proposition that it acts as a way to demand recognition of aspects of a group's culture subordination and its entire experience in contrast to a [[melting pot]] or non-multicultural societies.\n\nThe term multiculturalism is most often used in reference to Western [[nation-state]]s, which had seemingly achieved a de facto single national identity during the 18th and/or 19th centuries.<ref name=\"ZarateLevy2011\">{{cite book|author1=Genevi\u00e8ve Zarate|author2=Danielle Levy|author3=Claire Kramsch|title=Handbook of Multilingualism and Multiculturalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DYL4_6SvxewC&pg=PA377|date=19 April 2011|publisher=Archives contemporaines|isbn=978-2-8130-0039-2|page=377}}</ref>\nMulticulturalism has been official policy in several [[Western world|Western nations]] since the 1970s, for reasons that varied from country to country,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/most/pp4.htm |title=Policy Paper no. 4 \u2013 Multiculturalism: New Policy Responses to Diversity |publisher=Unesco.org |accessdate=2010-12-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ai-ia/rir-iro/gbll/divers/index-eng.cfm |title=Multiculturalism in Canada |publisher=Pch.gc.ca |date=9 April 2009 |accessdate=2010-12-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www4.gu.edu.au/ext/civics/cv02/mod03/cv02m03t02.htm |title=Immigration and Multiculturalism |publisher=.gu.edu.au |accessdate=2010-12-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219034150/http://www4.gu.edu.au/ext/civics/cv02/mod03/cv02m03t02.htm |archivedate=19 February 2011 }}</ref> including the fact that many of the great cities of the Western world are increasingly made of a mosaic of cultures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unu.edu/dialogue/papers/claval-s2.pdf |title=Multiculturalism and the Dynamics of Modern Civilizations |accessdate=2010-12-10}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Canadian government]] has often been described as the instigator of multicultural ideology because of its public emphasis on the [[Economic impact of immigration to Canada|social importance of immigration]].<ref>{{cite news|doi=10.1163/15718119720907408|title=Immigration, Multiculturalism and National Identity in Canada|journal= International Journal of Group Rights|first=Shara|last=Wayland|year=1997|volume=5|issue=1|pages= 33\u201358}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/ujjal-dosanjh-by-silencing-white-men-canada-cant-have-an-honest-debate-about-equality-race-and-culture|title=Ujjal Dosanjh: By silencing white men, Canada can't have an honest debate about equality, race and culture|last=|first=|date=4 January 2016|work=|newspaper=National Post|access-date=2017-01-16|via=}}</ref> The Canadian [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]] is often referred to as the origins of modern political awareness of multiculturalism.<ref name=\"II2010.\">{{cite book|author=Ronald L.

The report found that while the second generation non-Western immigrants do better than the first generation, the third generation of immigrants with non-Western background do no better education and employment wise than the second generation. One of the reasons was that second generation immigrants from non-Western countries marry someone from their country of origin and so Danish is not spoken at home which disadvantages children in school.

In May 1975, a unanimous Swedish parliament passed an act on a new multiculturalist immigrant and ethnic minority policy put forward by the [[social democracy|social democratic]] government, that explicitly rejected the ideal ethnic homogeneity and the policy of assimilation. The three main principles of the new policy were equality, partnership and freedom of choice. The explicit policy aim of the freedom of choice principle was to create the opportunity for minority groups in Sweden to retain their own languages and cultures. From the mid-1970s, the goal of enabling the preservation of minorities and creating a positive attitude towards the new officially endorsed multicultural society among the majority population became incorporated into the Swedish constitution as well as cultural, educational and media policies.

Despite centuries of acculturation with native Indonesians, because of their disproportionate influence on Indonesian economy, and alleged question of national loyalty, Chinese Indonesians have suffered [[Discrimination against Chinese Indonesians|discrimination]]. The [[Suharto]] ''Orde Baru'' or New Order adopted a forced [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] policy; which indicated that Chinese cultural elements were unacceptable.{{sfn|Tan|2008|p=24}} Chinese Indonesians were forced to adopt [[Chinese Indonesian surname|Indonesian-sounding names]], and the use of Chinese culture and language was banned. The violence targeting Chinese Indonesians erupted during [[Fall of Suharto#Riots of 13\u201314 May|riots in 1998.]] As the looting and destruction took place, a number of Chinese Indonesians, as well as looters, were killed. The Chinese Indonesians were treated as the scapegoat of [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]], a result of ongoing discrimination and segregation policies enforced during Suharto's New Order regime.

More Malays however have moved into the cities since the 1970s, and the proportion of the non-Malays have been decreasing continually, especially the Chinese, due in large part to lower birth-rate and emigration as a result of [[institutionalized discrimination]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://english.cpiasia.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1804:honey-i-shrunk-the-chinese-&catid=198:helen-ang&Itemid=156 |title=Honey, I shrunk the Chinese! |publisher=CPI |date=9 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525132129/http://english.cpiasia.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1804:honey-i-shrunk-the-chinese-&catid=198:helen-ang&Itemid=156 |archivedate=25 May 2012 }}</ref>\n\nPreceding independence of the [[Federation of Malaya]], a [[social contract (Malaysia)|social contract]] was negotiated as the basis of a new society.

[...] Having a two percent foreign population unquestionably causes ripples, but having one million temporary foreign residents does not make Korea a multicultural society. [...] In many ways, this homogeneity is one of Korea\u2019s greatest strengths. Shared values create harmony. Sacrifice for the nation is a given. Difficult and painful political and economic initiatives are endured without discussion or debate. It is easy to anticipate the needs and behavior of others. It is the cornerstone that has helped Korea survive adversity. But there is a downside, too. [...] Koreans are immersed in their culture and are thus blind to its characteristics and quirks. Examples of group think are everywhere. Because Koreans share values and views, they support decisions even when they are obviously bad.

It can describe a mixed ethnic community area where multiple cultural traditions exist (such as [[New York City]]) or a single country within which they do (such as Switzerland, Belgium or Russia). Groups associated with an indigenous or [[wikt:autochthonous|autochthonous]] ethnic group and foreigner ethnic groups are often the focus.\n\nIn reference to sociology, multiculturalism is the end-state of either a natural or artificial process (for example: legally-controlled [[immigration]]) and occurs on either a large national scale or on a smaller scale within a nation's communities. On a smaller scale this can occur artificially when a jurisdiction is established or expanded by amalgamating areas with two or more different cultures (e.g. [[French Canada]] and [[English Canada]]).

It is also a matter of economic interests and [[Power (social and political)|political power]].<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/multiculturalism/ Multiculturalism] \u2013 Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</ref> In more recent times political multiculturalist ideologies have been expanding in their use to include and define disadvantaged groups such as [[African American]]s, [[LGBT]], with arguments often focusing on ethnic and religious minorities, minority nations, [[indigenous peoples]] and even the disabled. It is within this context in which the term is most commonly understood and the broadness and scope of the definition, as well as its practical use, has been the subject of serious debate.\n\nMost debates over multiculturalism center around whether or not multiculturalism is the appropriate way to deal with diversity and immigrant integration. The arguments regarding the perceived rights to a multicultural education include the proposition that it acts as a way to demand recognition of aspects of a group's culture subordination and its entire experience in contrast to a [[melting pot]] or non-multicultural societies.\n\nThe term multiculturalism is most often used in reference to Western [[nation-state]]s, which had seemingly achieved a de facto single national identity during the 18th and/or 19th centuries.<ref name=\"ZarateLevy2011\">{{cite book|author1=Genevi\u00e8ve Zarate|author2=Danielle Levy|author3=Claire Kramsch|title=Handbook of Multilingualism and Multiculturalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DYL4_6SvxewC&pg=PA377|date=19 April 2011|publisher=Archives contemporaines|isbn=978-2-8130-0039-2|page=377}}</ref>\nMulticulturalism has been official policy in several [[Western world|Western nations]] since the 1970s, for reasons that varied from country to country,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/most/pp4.htm |title=Policy Paper no. 4 \u2013 Multiculturalism: New Policy Responses to Diversity |publisher=Unesco.org |accessdate=2010-12-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ai-ia/rir-iro/gbll/divers/index-eng.cfm |title=Multiculturalism in Canada |publisher=Pch.gc.ca |date=9 April 2009 |accessdate=2010-12-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www4.gu.edu.au/ext/civics/cv02/mod03/cv02m03t02.htm |title=Immigration and Multiculturalism |publisher=.gu.edu.au |accessdate=2010-12-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219034150/http://www4.gu.edu.au/ext/civics/cv02/mod03/cv02m03t02.htm |archivedate=19 February 2011 }}</ref> including the fact that many of the great cities of the Western world are increasingly made of a mosaic of cultures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unu.edu/dialogue/papers/claval-s2.pdf |title=Multiculturalism and the Dynamics of Modern Civilizations |accessdate=2010-12-10}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Canadian government]] has often been described as the instigator of multicultural ideology because of its public emphasis on the [[Economic impact of immigration to Canada|social importance of immigration]].<ref>{{cite news|doi=10.1163/15718119720907408|title=Immigration, Multiculturalism and National Identity in Canada|journal= International Journal of Group Rights|first=Shara|last=Wayland|year=1997|volume=5|issue=1|pages= 33\u201358}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/ujjal-dosanjh-by-silencing-white-men-canada-cant-have-an-honest-debate-about-equality-race-and-culture|title=Ujjal Dosanjh: By silencing white men, Canada can't have an honest debate about equality, race and culture|last=|first=|date=4 January 2016|work=|newspaper=National Post|access-date=2017-01-16|via=}}</ref> The Canadian [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]] is often referred to as the origins of modern political awareness of multiculturalism.<ref name=\"II2010.\">{{cite book|author=Ronald L.

The report found that while the second generation non-Western immigrants do better than the first generation, the third generation of immigrants with non-Western background do no better education and employment wise than the second generation. One of the reasons was that second generation immigrants from non-Western countries marry someone from their country of origin and so Danish is not spoken at home which disadvantages children in school.

In May 1975, a unanimous Swedish parliament passed an act on a new multiculturalist immigrant and ethnic minority policy put forward by the [[social democracy|social democratic]] government, that explicitly rejected the ideal ethnic homogeneity and the policy of assimilation. The three main principles of the new policy were equality, partnership and freedom of choice. The explicit policy aim of the freedom of choice principle was to create the opportunity for minority groups in Sweden to retain their own languages and cultures. From the mid-1970s, the goal of enabling the preservation of minorities and creating a positive attitude towards the new officially endorsed multicultural society among the majority population became incorporated into the Swedish constitution as well as cultural, educational and media policies.

[...] Having a two percent foreign population unquestionably causes ripples, but having one million temporary foreign residents does not make Korea a multicultural society. [...] In many ways, this homogeneity is one of Korea\u2019s greatest strengths. Shared values create harmony. Sacrifice for the nation is a given. Difficult and painful political and economic initiatives are endured without discussion or debate. It is easy to anticipate the needs and behavior of others. It is the cornerstone that has helped Korea survive adversity. But there is a downside, too. [...] Koreans are immersed in their culture and are thus blind to its characteristics and quirks.

{"title_page": "Auburn Speedster", "text_new": "{{short description|American automobile model (1925\u20131937)}}\n{{Refimprove|date=August 2012}}\n[[File:Auburn Boattail Speedster 851 1935.jpg|thumb|Auburn Boattail Speedster 851]]\n\n\nThe '''Auburn Speedster''' was an American car, manufactured by the [[Auburn Automobile|Auburn Automobile Company]] of [[Auburn, Indiana]]. The Auburn 851 Speedster of 1935 was styled by designer [[Gordon Buehrig]], who also was responsible for the  [[Cord Automobile|Cord Model 810]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1924 Auburn output was down to six cars a day.  [[Errett Lobban Cord]]\u2014a car salesman\u2014took over the lackluster company, and brought in James Crawford to design a new range.\n\nThe first Auburn eight was launched in 1925, and renamed the 8-88 in 1926 with a 4.8-liter side-valve 68&nbsp;bhp Lycoming engine.  That remained in use until 1930, when it developed 115&nbsp;bhp, hence the \"Speedster 115\" model name.\nThe rest of the car was straightforward.  Suspension was by semi-elliptic springs all round,<ref name=\"Cheetham\">{{cite book |last1=Cheetham |first1=Craig |title=Vintage Cars: The Finest Prewar Automobiles |date=2004 |publisher=Grange Books |location=Rochester, United Kingdom |isbn=1840136359 |pages=31}}</ref> and after experiments with hydraulic brakes, Auburn opted for mechanical brakes.  The three-speed gearbox was in unit with the engine.  The impressive open two-seater body styled by Count Alexis de Sakhnoffsky featured a boat-tail and a vee windscreen. The \"115\" became the \"125\" in 1930, with a \"cabin speedster\" among the models, advertised as a \"racing car with comfort of a closed car\" with a 125&nbsp;bhp version of the Lycoming eight giving it a claimed top speed of over 100&nbsp;mph.\nA V12 range, using a 6.4-liter engine designed by George Kublin and built by Lycoming, was a failure, and 1934 marked its demise.<ref name=\"Cheetham\" />  Yet Auburn was to enjoy a memorable final fling with the \"851 speedster\". This was introduced in 1931 with masterly bodywork by Gordon Buehrig that was ingeniously and cheaply built.  The car was simple enough.  The flat-head eight was strong, reliable and it was not overly stressed.  Those sweeping lines concealed some interesting technical features such as the Columbia dual-ratio rear axle<ref name=\"Cheetham\" /> that was achieved by interposing an epicyclic gear train between the axle and the crown wheel.  When it was engaged, the final drive ratio became a \"fast\" 4.5:1.  It was disengaged by moving a steering-wheel mounted lever and dipping the clutch, whereupon the ratio became a more leisurely 3:1.  The three-speed synchromesh gearbox along with that dual ratio axle gave a six-speed transmission.

The Auburn 851 Speedster of 1935 was styled by designer [[Gordon Buehrig]], who also was responsible for the  [[Cord Automobile|Cord Model 810]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1924 Auburn output was down to six cars a day.  [[Errett Lobban Cord]]\u2014a car salesman\u2014took over the lackluster company, and brought in James Crawford to design a new range.\n\nThe first Auburn eight was launched in 1925, and renamed the 8-88 in 1926 with a 4.8-liter side-valve 68&nbsp;bhp Lycoming engine.  That remained in use until 1930, when it developed 115&nbsp;bhp, hence the \"Speedster 115\" model name.\nThe rest of the car was straightforward.  Suspension was by semi-elliptic springs all round,<ref name=\"Cheetham\">{{cite book |last1=Cheetham |first1=Craig |title=Vintage Cars: The Finest Prewar Automobiles |date=2004 |publisher=Grange Books |location=Rochester, United Kingdom |isbn=1840136359 |pages=31}}</ref> and after experiments with hydraulic brakes, Auburn opted for mechanical brakes.  The three-speed gearbox was in unit with the engine.  The impressive open two-seater body styled by Count Alexis de Sakhnoffsky featured a boat-tail and a vee windscreen. The \"115\" became the \"125\" in 1930, with a \"cabin speedster\" among the models, advertised as a \"racing car with comfort of a closed car\" with a 125&nbsp;bhp version of the Lycoming eight giving it a claimed top speed of over 100&nbsp;mph.\nA V12 range, using a 6.4-liter engine designed by George Kublin and built by Lycoming, was a failure, and 1934 marked its demise.<ref name=\"Cheetham\" />  Yet Auburn was to enjoy a memorable final fling with the \"851 speedster\". This was introduced in 1931 with masterly bodywork by Gordon Buehrig that was ingeniously and cheaply built.  The car was simple enough.  The flat-head eight was strong, reliable and it was not overly stressed.  Those sweeping lines concealed some interesting technical features such as the Columbia dual-ratio rear axle<ref name=\"Cheetham\" /> that was achieved by interposing an epicyclic gear train between the axle and the crown wheel.  When it was engaged, the final drive ratio became a \"fast\" 4.5:1.  It was disengaged by moving a steering-wheel mounted lever and dipping the clutch, whereupon the ratio became a more leisurely 3:1.  The three-speed synchromesh gearbox along with that dual ratio axle gave a six-speed transmission. In 1936 came the 852, identical to the earlier models with the exception of the \"852\" on its radiator grille.  The end however, was not far off, and Auburn ceased car production in 1937.\n\nThe Speedster's iconic \"boattail\" design would be replicated on cars from later decades, with the two most notable examples being the 1963\u20131967 [[Chevrolet Corvette (C2)|Chevrolet Corvette Stingray]] and the 1971\u20131973 [[Buick Riviera]].\n\n==Evolution==\n* '''1925''': First Auburn eight introduced as the Eight-In-Line.\n* '''1926''': Engine size increased from 4.5 liters to 4.8 liters and the model renamed the 8-88.\n* '''1927''': The 68&nbsp;hp engine uprated to 115&nbsp;hp and the car is renamed the 115.\n* '''1929''': 120 development of 115 introduced.\n* '''1930''': 125 introduced.\n* '''1934''': The best known Speedster\u2014the 851\u2014was introduced for the 1935 model year.

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992. Everett received an [[All-America City Award]] in 2002.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses.\n\n==History==\n[[File:everettwaterfront.jpg|thumb| [[Weyerhaeuser]] Lumber Mill, Everett Waterfront, c. early 1900s]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes, including the [[Snohomish people|Snohomish]], who maintained a winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The area was explored by the [[Vancouver Expedition]] of 1792, which landed on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claimed the land for [[England]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The Snohomish and other tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, \nrelocating to the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]] and relinquishing its lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]], opening the region to American settlement.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] on Port Gardner Bay in 1861 and built a cabin for himself. He was joined by several other families on their own homesteads, which included the establishment of a general store and a [[sawmill]] that quickly went out of business.<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=http://www.historylink.org/File/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> Over the next several years a handful of settlers moved to the area, but it wasn't until 1890 that plans for platting a town were conceived.\n\nOn July 17, 1890, The steamship ''[[Queen of the Pacific]]'' left [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] for an Alaskan cruise with [[Henry Hewitt, Jr.]] and [[Charles L. Colby]] aboard. During this \"Fateful voyage\" initial plans for an industrial city on the peninsula along the banks of the Snohomish river were formulated. On August 22, 1890, The [[Rucker Brothers]] filed their [[plat]] at Port Gardner, a {{convert|50|acre|m2|adj=on}} townsite on the bayfront side of what is now the city of Everett. This plat was later withdrawn to accommodate the plans of the Hewitt-Colby group.\n\nOn September 1, 1890, Henry Hewitt filed a bond on the Davis tract at the north end of what was to become the Everett town site, beginning the process of acquisition that would become the Everett Land Company later along with Charles L. Colby and [[Colgate Hoyt]]. In October 1890, the Hewitt-Colby syndicate decided to name their industrial city after Everett Colby, the fifteen-year-old son of investor Charles L. Colby, who had displayed a prodigious appetite at dinner. Everett Colby in turn was named for orator [[Edward Everett]].\n\nOn November 19, 1890, the Articles of Incorporation for the Everett Land Company were filed, with Henry Hewitt Jr. as president. On November 26, 1890, the Rucker Brothers transferred {{convert|434.15|acre|km2}} of property on the Everett peninsula to Hewitt. Three days later, \"The Remarkable Document\" was drafted, setting the terms by which the Rucker Brothers would donate half their remaining holdings to Hewitt in exchange for promises of specific development.\n\nThe Company bought much of the Ruckers' land, taking them in as junior partners. Everett was officially incorporated on May 4, 1893, the year the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] came to the town. Both Hewitt and the Ruckers had speculated that [[James J. Hill]] would make the town the terminus of his railroad. However Hill continued the railroad along the shore of [[Puget Sound]] to [[Seattle]]. Although it succeeded in building the city, the Everett Land Company was a failure for its investors. The outside investors withdrew, and the Company's holdings were transferred to a new company controlled by Hill. The Ruckers, who helped broker the deal, stayed in Everett and became leading citizens of the young city.\n\nRailroads and mines played a part in Everett's future. The mining community of [[Monte Cristo, Washington|Monte Cristo]] depended on a railway for supplies. It was hoped that the railroad would cross the mountains and bring in traffic. For a while ore was smelted in Everett, then sawmilling and port activity commenced. A dozen steam riverboats were built in Everett for the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Yukon gold rush]].\n\nSeveral survivors of the [[Bellingham riots]] settled in Everett for two months, until they were beaten and forcefully evicted by a mob on November 5, 1907. Everett also was the site of the [[Everett Massacre]] of 1916 in which a posse led by local Sheriff Donald McRae shot and killed five [[Industrial Workers of the World]] members. The IWW members on the [[Verona (steamship)|steamer ''Verona'']] travelled from Seattle to support strikers in Everett and sought to land, but McRae and his posse of deputized civilians blocked the harbor. Shooting broke out and at least five IWW members were killed, along with two in the posse who were deemed to have been killed by friendly fire.\n\nEverett streets are named after each of the three founders. Adjacent streets Colby Avenue and Hoyt Avenue run north and south and are intersected by Hewitt Avenue running east and west just south of the [[BNSF Railway]] tracks cutting across Everett. There are several other streets named for their associates such as Bond Street named for Judge [[Hiram Bond]], President of the Everett & Monte Cristo Railroad. Parallel to Colby and Hoyt are avenues named for other investors, [[John D. Rockefeller]], railroad executive [[Thomas Fletcher Oakes|T.F. Oakes]], shipbuilder [[Alexander McDougall (1845-1923)|Alexander McDougall]], and McDougall's associate [[Charles W.

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992. Everett received an [[All-America City Award]] in 2002.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses.\n\n==History==\n[[File:everettwaterfront.jpg|thumb| [[Weyerhaeuser]] Lumber Mill, Everett Waterfront, c. early 1900s]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes, including the [[Snohomish people|Snohomish]], who maintained a winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The area was explored by the [[Vancouver Expedition]] of 1792, which landed on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claimed the land for [[England]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The Snohomish and other tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, \nrelocating to the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]] and relinquishing its lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]], opening the region to American settlement.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] on Port Gardner Bay in 1861 and built a cabin for himself. He was joined by several other families on their own homesteads, which included the establishment of a general store and a [[sawmill]] that quickly went out of business.<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=http://www.historylink.org/File/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> Over the next several years a handful of settlers moved to the area, but it wasn't until 1890 that plans for platting a town were conceived.\n\nOn July 17, 1890, The steamship ''[[Queen of the Pacific]]'' left [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] for an Alaskan cruise with [[Henry Hewitt, Jr.]] and [[Charles L. Colby]] aboard. During this \"Fateful voyage\" initial plans for an industrial city on the peninsula along the banks of the Snohomish river were formulated. On August 22, 1890, The [[Rucker Brothers]] filed their [[plat]] at Port Gardner, a {{convert|50|acre|m2|adj=on}} townsite on the bayfront side of what is now the city of Everett. This plat was later withdrawn to accommodate the plans of the Hewitt-Colby group.\n\nOn September 1, 1890, Henry Hewitt filed a bond on the Davis tract at the north end of what was to become the Everett town site, beginning the process of acquisition that would become the Everett Land Company later along with Charles L. Colby and [[Colgate Hoyt]]. In October 1890, the Hewitt-Colby syndicate decided to name their industrial city after Everett Colby, the fifteen-year-old son of investor Charles L. Colby, who had displayed a prodigious appetite at dinner. Everett Colby in turn was named for orator [[Edward Everett]].\n\nOn November 19, 1890, the Articles of Incorporation for the Everett Land Company were filed, with Henry Hewitt Jr. as president. On November 26, 1890, the Rucker Brothers transferred {{convert|434.15|acre|km2}} of property on the Everett peninsula to Hewitt. Three days later, \"The Remarkable Document\" was drafted, setting the terms by which the Rucker Brothers would donate half their remaining holdings to Hewitt in exchange for promises of specific development.\n\nThe Company bought much of the Ruckers' land, taking them in as junior partners. Everett was officially incorporated on May 4, 1893, the year the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] came to the town. Both Hewitt and the Ruckers had speculated that [[James J. Hill]] would make the town the terminus of his railroad. However Hill continued the railroad along the shore of [[Puget Sound]] to [[Seattle]]. Although it succeeded in building the city, the Everett Land Company was a failure for its investors. The outside investors withdrew, and the Company's holdings were transferred to a new company controlled by Hill. The Ruckers, who helped broker the deal, stayed in Everett and became leading citizens of the young city.\n\nRailroads and mines played a part in Everett's future. The mining community of [[Monte Cristo, Washington|Monte Cristo]] depended on a railway for supplies. It was hoped that the railroad would cross the mountains and bring in traffic. For a while ore was smelted in Everett, then sawmilling and port activity commenced. A dozen steam riverboats were built in Everett for the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Yukon gold rush]].\n\nSeveral survivors of the [[Bellingham riots]] settled in Everett for two months, until they were beaten and forcefully evicted by a mob on November 5, 1907. Everett also was the site of the [[Everett Massacre]] of 1916 in which a posse led by local Sheriff Donald McRae shot and killed five [[Industrial Workers of the World]] members. The IWW members on the [[Verona (steamship)|steamer ''Verona'']] travelled from Seattle to support strikers in Everett and sought to land, but McRae and his posse of deputized civilians blocked the harbor. Shooting broke out and at least five IWW members were killed, along with two in the posse who were deemed to have been killed by friendly fire.\n\nEverett streets are named after each of the three founders. Adjacent streets Colby Avenue and Hoyt Avenue run north and south and are intersected by Hewitt Avenue running east and west just south of the [[BNSF Railway]] tracks cutting across Everett. There are several other streets named for their associates such as Bond Street named for Judge [[Hiram Bond]], President of the Everett & Monte Cristo Railroad. Parallel to Colby and Hoyt are avenues named for other investors, [[John D. Rockefeller]], railroad executive [[Thomas Fletcher Oakes|T.F. Oakes]], shipbuilder [[Alexander McDougall (1845-1923)|Alexander McDougall]], and McDougall's associate [[Charles W. Wetmore]].\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], the [[Works Progress Administration]] was tasked with construction of several public works projects in the Everett area, including a new county airport that later became [[Paine Field]]. The airport was appropriated for military use during [[World War II]], but was later turned over to county ownership.<ref name=\"HistoryLink\"/> The [[Boeing Company]] selected a {{convert|780|acre|ha|adj=mid}} plot of land north of the airport in June 1966 to build a [[Boeing Everett Factory|new airplane factory]] for its [[Boeing 747]] passenger jetliner, which would become the world's first \"jumbo jet\".

It is also important to note that according to both primary sources of Woodlin and Lux et Veritas, Alexander Elston, whom is referenced for New York not joining the National was a National Grand Lodge officer (National Grand Sword Bearer) The primary purpose of the meeting was to heal tensions between the two Pennsylvania Grand Lodges and to unify the bodies of African American Freemasons in light of them being excluded from the predominantly white Freemasonry in the United States. The National Grand Lodge approved its Declaration of Sentiments which were as follows:\n\n===Sentiment One===\n\"The question has been asked the cause of the separate organizations of white and colored Masons in the United States of America. We do not know of any good reason why there should be, and we have made several attempts without success to have but one. We are, and always have been, in procession of all the ancient landmarks and regulations of the craft, and we do acknowledge all genuine Masons of all Nations and complexion to be our brethren.\"\n\n===Sentiment Two===\n\"THEREFORE, in pursuance of the above call, we have met in the city of Boston, State Massachusetts, in the year and date above-mentioned, and do form in solemn convention and say before the world our sentiments thereon.\"\n\n===Sentiment Three===\n\"In all stages of oppression we have petitioned for redress, but found none; therefore, in solemn convention assembled, we do, in the name of the Great Masonic Body of Free and Accepted A.Y. Masons, declare ourselves a free and independent body of Masons, to be known as the National Grand Lodge of Color of these United States of America and Masonic Jurisdiction, with full power to grant Letters of Dispensation and Warrants to all State Grand Lodges under our Jurisdiction, and that the said State Grand Lodges shall have full power to grant letters of dispensation and warrants to the subordinate Lodges under the several jurisdictions, and to establish as many Lodges as they may deem most expedient.\"\n\n===Sentiment Four===\n\"Not that we have been wanting in attention to our white Brethren. We have from time to time solicited them to extend their jurisdiction over us, but to no effect. We, therefore, the delegates of the several Lodges throughout the United States, in convention assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do in the name and by the authority of our constituents, declare and publish the said National Grand Lodge of Color of the United States to be a free and independent body, with full power, as named in third article of this declaration, and for the support of the declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge ourselves to each other in the solemn ties of brotherhood.\"<ref>Proceedings of the M.

Masonic author Alton Roundtree said the following: \"The National Grand Lodge was formed by three Grand Lodges that had lineage to African Lodge No. 459. Thus it had lineage to African Lodge when it was formed.\"<ref name=\"Roundtree\" /> These facts supported by the literature on the subject are one of contention among debate circles. \n\nAll Grand Lodges with lineage to African Lodge No. 459 were established in either of the following ways: <br>\na. By Warrant of the National Grand Lodge.<br>\nb. By three Lodges that were established as National Grand Lodge subordinates.<br>\nc. By merger (as Equals) of Independent and National Grand Lodges subordinate Grand Lodges.<br>\nd. Independent PHA Grand Lodges with lineage to either a., b., or c.<ref name=\"Roundtree\" />\n\nThis lineage has been, most recently acknowledged by the Prince Hall Conference of Grand Masters which stated in 2012:\n\nCommittee on Bogus Masonry, MWGM Robert E. Joseph (IA) Chaired this Committee. \"In essence the Committee stated there are only two legal Masonic bodies in the United States of America:\n\n-The Grand Lodges that can prove authority from the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts organized by Henry Price in July 1733 (White Masons)\n\n-All Grand Lodges tracking their lineage to African Lodge No. 459 organized by Prince Hall from March 1775 (African American Masons)\n\nThus said, if we intend to have a relationship of some kind then we recommend that we focus on Prince Hall Affiliated Grand Lodges who can trace their lineage to African Lodge No. 459 and develop an approach to convince them that Prince Hall Masonry is the way to go.  The first step is to stop the name calling.  Second, open a dialogue with PHO bodies.

It is also important to note that according to both primary sources of Woodlin and Lux et Veritas, Alexander Elston, whom is referenced for New York not joining the National was a National Grand Lodge officer (National Grand Sword Bearer) The primary purpose of the meeting was to heal tensions between the two Pennsylvania Grand Lodges and to unify the bodies of African American Freemasons in light of them being excluded from the predominantly white Freemasonry in the United States. The National Grand Lodge approved its Declaration of Sentiments which were as follows:\n\n===Sentiment One===\n\"The question has been asked the cause of the separate organizations of white and colored Masons in the United States of America. We do not know of any good reason why there should be, and we have made several attempts without success to have but one. We are, and always have been, in procession of all the ancient landmarks and regulations of the craft, and we do acknowledge all genuine Masons of all Nations and complexion to be our brethren.\"\n\n===Sentiment Two===\n\"THEREFORE, in pursuance of the above call, we have met in the city of Boston, State Massachusetts, in the year and date above-mentioned, and do form in solemn convention and say before the world our sentiments thereon.\"\n\n===Sentiment Three===\n\"In all stages of oppression we have petitioned for redress, but found none; therefore, in solemn convention assembled, we do, in the name of the Great Masonic Body of Free and Accepted A.Y. Masons, declare ourselves a free and independent body of Masons, to be known as the National Grand Lodge of Color of these United States of America and Masonic Jurisdiction, with full power to grant Letters of Dispensation and Warrants to all State Grand Lodges under our Jurisdiction, and that the said State Grand Lodges shall have full power to grant letters of dispensation and warrants to the subordinate Lodges under the several jurisdictions, and to establish as many Lodges as they may deem most expedient.\"\n\n===Sentiment Four===\n\"Not that we have been wanting in attention to our white Brethren. We have from time to time solicited them to extend their jurisdiction over us, but to no effect. We, therefore, the delegates of the several Lodges throughout the United States, in convention assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do in the name and by the authority of our constituents, declare and publish the said National Grand Lodge of Color of the United States to be a free and independent body, with full power, as named in third article of this declaration, and for the support of the declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge ourselves to each other in the solemn ties of brotherhood.\"<ref>Proceedings of the M.

Masonic author Alton Roundtree said the following: \"The National Grand Lodge was formed by three Grand Lodges that had lineage to African Lodge No. 459. Thus it had lineage to African Lodge when it was formed.\"<ref name=\"Roundtree\" /> These facts supported by the literature on the subject are one of contention among debate circles. \n\nAll Grand Lodges with lineage to African Lodge No. 459 were established in either of the following ways: <br>\na. By Warrant of the National Grand Lodge.<br>\nb. By three Lodges that were established as National Grand Lodge subordinates.<br>\nc. By merger (as Equals) of Independent and National Grand Lodges subordinate Grand Lodges.<br>\nd. Independent PHA Grand Lodges with lineage to either a., b., or c.<ref name=\"Roundtree\" />\n\nThis lineage has been, most recently acknowledged by the Prince Hall Conference of Grand Masters which stated in 2012:\n\nCommittee on Bogus Masonry, MWGM Robert E. Joseph (IA) Chaired this Committee. \"In essence the Committee stated there are only two legal Masonic bodies in the United States of America:\n\n-The Grand Lodges that can prove authority from the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts organized by Henry Price in July 1733 (White Masons)\n\n-All Grand Lodges tracking their lineage to African Lodge No. 459 organized by Prince Hall from March 1775 (African American Masons)\n\nThus said, if we intend to have a relationship of some kind then we recommend that we focus on Prince Hall Affiliated Grand Lodges who can trace their lineage to African Lodge No. 459 and develop an approach to convince them that Prince Hall Masonry is the way to go.  The first step is to stop the name calling.  Second, open a dialogue with PHO bodies. The Committee report was approved.\"<ref>Proceedings Prince Hall Conference of Grand Masters, 2012</ref>\n\n\n\n-The following are several Prince Hall Affiliated Grand Lodges which were established by warrant of the National Grand Lodge:\n\n;The MW Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Massachusetts\nThe Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Massachusetts was established by the National Grand Lodge in April 1848 under [[John T.

Born and raised in [[Swansea]], Jones aspired to be an actress from a young age. As a child, she played roles in the [[West End theatre|West End]] productions of the musicals ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'' and ''[[Bugsy Malone]]''. She studied musical theatre at the [[Arts Educational Schools, London]] and made her stage breakthrough with a leading role in a 1987 production of ''[[42nd Street (musical)|42nd Street]]''. Her screen debut came in the unsuccessful French-Italian film ''[[1001 Nights (1990 film)|1001 Nights]]'' (1990), and she went on to find greater success as a regular in the British television series ''[[The Darling Buds of May (TV series)|The Darling Buds of May]]'' (1991\u20131993). Dismayed at being [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as the token pretty girl in British films, Jones relocated to Los Angeles.\n\nJones established herself in Hollywood with roles that highlighted her sex appeal, such as in the action film ''[[The Mask of Zorro]]'' (1998) and the heist film ''[[Entrapment (film)|Entrapment]]'' (1999). She received acclaim for her performances as a vengeful pregnant woman in ''[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]'' (2000) and a murderous singer in the musical ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'' (2002); for the latter she won [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Academy]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|BAFTA]] Awards for Best Supporting Actress. She starred in high-profile films for much of the decade, including the black comedy ''[[Intolerable Cruelty]]'' (2003), the heist film ''[[Ocean's Twelve]]'' (2004), the comedy ''[[The Terminal]]'' (2004), and the romantic comedy ''[[No Reservations (film)|No Reservations]]'' (2007). Parts in smaller-scale features were followed by a decrease in workload, during which she returned to stage and played an ageing actress in ''[[A Little Night Music]]'' (2009), winning a [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical|Tony Award]]. Jones continued to work intermittently in the 2010s, starring in the psychological thriller ''[[Side Effects (2013 film)|Side Effects]]'' (2013) and the action film ''[[Red 2 (film)|Red 2]]'' (2013), and portrayed actress [[Olivia de Havilland]] in the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] television series ''[[Feud (TV series)|Feud]]'' (2017).\n\nJones is the recipient of [[List of roles and awards of Catherine Zeta-Jones#Awards and nominations|several accolades]], including an [[Academy Award]], a [[British Academy Film Award]] and a [[Tony Award]], and in 2010, she was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) for her film and humanitarian endeavours.

Her screen debut came in the unsuccessful French-Italian film ''[[1001 Nights (1990 film)|1001 Nights]]'' (1990), and she went on to find greater success as a regular in the British television series ''[[The Darling Buds of May (TV series)|The Darling Buds of May]]'' (1991\u20131993).

In 2000, Sia released her second studio album, ''[[Healing Is Difficult]]'', and her third studio album, ''[[Colour the Small One]]'', in 2004, but all of these struggled to connect with a mainstream audience.\n\nSia relocated to New York City in 2005 and toured in the United States. Her fourth and fifth studio albums, ''[[Some People Have Real Problems]]'' and ''[[We Are Born]]'', were released in 2008 and 2010, respectively. Each was certified gold by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] and attracted wider notice than her earlier albums. Uncomfortable with her growing fame, Sia took a hiatus from performing, during which she focused on songwriting for other artists, producing successful collaborations \"[[Titanium (song)|Titanium]]\" (with [[David Guetta]]) which top UK charts stepping her into fame, \"[[Diamonds (Rihanna song)|Diamonds]]\" (with [[Rihanna]]) and \"[[Wild Ones (song)|Wild Ones]]\" (with [[Flo Rida]]). Sia is a type of singer which mainly focuses on the story of survival behind every ounce of pain.\n\nIn 2014, Sia broke through as a solo recording artist when her sixth studio album, ''[[1000 Forms of Fear]]'', debuted at No 1 in the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and generated the top-ten single \"[[Chandelier (song)|Chandelier]]\" which also won the International song of the year award presented by NRJ Music Awards and a trilogy of music videos starring child dancer [[Maddie Ziegler]]. Since then, Sia has usually worn a wig that obscures her face to protect her privacy.<ref name=Age/> Her seventh studio album ''[[This Is Acting]]'' (2016), spawned her first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number one single, \"[[Cheap Thrills (song)|Cheap Thrills]]\" and is also one of the artist to top the Billboard hot 100 after 40 yrs of age as compared to other emerging artists.The same year, Sia gave her [[Nostalgic for the Present Tour]], which incorporated dancing by Ziegler and others and other performance art elements. Her eighth studio album, ''[[Everyday Is Christmas (album)|Everyday Is Christmas]]'', was released in 2017 and [[reissue]]d in 2018 with three bonus tracks. In 2018 and 2019 she collaborated with [[Labrinth]] and [[Diplo]] in the group [[LSD (group)|LSD]], and they released their [[LSD (album)|self-titled debut album]] in April 2019. Among the [[List of awards and nominations received by Sia|accolades]] received by Sia are nearly a dozen [[ARIA Awards]], 9 [[Grammy Award]] nominations,  a Rolling Stone Australia Awards and a [[MTV Video Music Award]].<ref name=ARIA2014>{{cite web| url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/40788/Chet-Faker-and-Violent-Soho-lead-20sheeran14-ARIA-nominations|title=Chet Faker and Violent Soholead 2014 ARIA nominations|publisher=fasterlouder|accessdate=5 November 2014}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\n===1975\u20131997: Early life and career beginnings===\nSia Kate Isobelle Furler was born on 18 December 1975 in [[Adelaide]], South Australia.

In 1997, when Crisp disbanded, she released her debut [[studio album]] titled ''OnlySee'' in Australia. She moved to London, England, and provided lead vocals for the British duo [[Zero 7]]. In 2000, Sia released her second studio album, ''[[Healing Is Difficult]]'', and her third studio album, ''[[Colour the Small One]]'', in 2004, but all of these struggled to connect with a mainstream audience.\n\nSia relocated to New York City in 2005 and toured in the United States. Her fourth and fifth studio albums, ''[[Some People Have Real Problems]]'' and ''[[We Are Born]]'', were released in 2008 and 2010, respectively. Each was certified gold by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] and attracted wider notice than her earlier albums. Uncomfortable with her growing fame, Sia took a hiatus from performing, during which she focused on songwriting for other artists, producing successful collaborations \"[[Titanium (song)|Titanium]]\" (with [[David Guetta]]) which top UK charts stepping her into fame, \"[[Diamonds (Rihanna song)|Diamonds]]\" (with [[Rihanna]]) and \"[[Wild Ones (song)|Wild Ones]]\" (with [[Flo Rida]]).\n\nIn 2014, Sia broke through as a solo recording artist when her sixth studio album, ''[[1000 Forms of Fear]]'', debuted at No 1 in the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and generated the top-ten single \"[[Chandelier (song)|Chandelier]]\" which also won the International song of the year award presented by NRJ Music Awards and a trilogy of music videos starring child dancer [[Maddie Ziegler]]. Since then, Sia has usually worn a wig that obscures her face to protect her privacy.<ref name=Age/> Her seventh studio album ''[[This Is Acting]]'' (2016), spawned her first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number one single, \"[[Cheap Thrills (song)|Cheap Thrills]]\" and is also one of the artist to top the Billboard hot 100 after 40 yrs of age as compared to other emerging artists.The same year, Sia gave her [[Nostalgic for the Present Tour]], which incorporated dancing by Ziegler and others and other performance art elements. Her eighth studio album, ''[[Everyday Is Christmas (album)|Everyday Is Christmas]]'', was released in 2017 and [[reissue]]d in 2018 with three bonus tracks. In 2018 and 2019 she collaborated with [[Labrinth]] and [[Diplo]] in the group [[LSD (group)|LSD]], and they released their [[LSD (album)|self-titled debut album]] in April 2019.

However, he sees a beautiful [[Italian people|Italian]] woman in the Cusamanos' garden next door. Her name is Isabella, she tells him; she is a [[Student exchange program|foreign exchange student]], staying there while the Cusamanos are away. He takes her out to lunch. As she describes the beauty of [[Avellino]], where Tony's grandfather came from, he has a daydream. Isabella is in a village house, in a rocking-chair, [[breastfeeding|nursing]] a baby named Antonio.\n\nThen Isabella is no longer there. When the Cusamanos return and he asks about her, Tony realizes she never existed: it was a [[hallucination|delusion]]. [[Jennifer Melfi|Dr. Melfi]] instructs him to cease taking [[Lithium pharmacology|lithium]], and theorizes that Isabella was an idealized maternal figure. \n\n[[Mikey Palmice|Mikey]], acting through [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Donnie Paduana|Donnie Paduana]], has contracted two black gunmen to carry out the hit on Tony. When he tries to report the details to [[Junior Soprano|Junior]], he cannot bear to hear them, and stops him.   \n\nWhen Tony goes out on the day, [[Christopher Moltisanti|Chris]], who is concerned about his boss's emotional state, secretly follows him and  unknowingly prevents the hit when he pulls his car up next to the assassins'. There is an urgent outdoor meeting between Mikey and Donnie; Junior is present, hiding on the back seat of the car. Donnie promises the hit will be the next day, and casually remarks that even Tony's mother wants him dead. Junior, fearing the gossip, wordlessly tells Mikey to kill Donnie, and he does it. \n\nThe next day, the assassins make their move. In a ferocious struggle, one of them is killed and the other is briefly dragged along the street as Tony drives away. Elated, he can't help crashing into a parked car. In the hospital, with only minor injuries, he says it was an attempted carjack, but not even [[Anthony Soprano, Jr.|A.J.]] believes that. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Agent [[Dwight Harris|Harris]] comes to his bed and offers a deal, including [[immunity from prosecution]], which Tony scornfully rejects.\n\nThe next day, Livia and Junior call on Tony at home.

He has the unique distinction of being the only Vice-Chancellor (2002\u201305) of the [[Banaras Hindu University]] (BHU) who was also a student (1963\u201368) and faculty (1964\u201392) at that institution. From 1992 to 2002, Rao was the Director of the [[National Metallurgical Laboratory]], [[Jamshedpur]]. After his tenure as Vice-Chancellor of B.H.U., in 2005, he took the reins of the [[Defence Institute of Advanced Technology]] (DIAT) as its first Vice-Chancellor. He was to serve DIAT until his superannuation in 2007. From 2007 till the end, Rao was a Raja Ramanna Fellow at the [[International Advanced Research Centre for Powder Metallurgy and New Materials]], in [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], Andhra Pradesh.\n\n==Early years==\nRao was born on 21 March 1942 to S. R. Narayanaswamy Naidu and Laxmi Bai at Kavutavaram in the Krishna District of [[Andhra Pradesh]]. His father Narayanaswamy Naidu, was a government servant and retired as Deputy Registrar of Co-operative Societies while his mother, Laxmi Bai was also educated and studied up to matriculation when very few women were going to school. From his mother's side, Rao is the nephew of [[Narla Venkateswara Rao]], a [[Telugu language]] writer, journalist and politician from Andhra Pradesh, Narla Gowri Shankar Rao, an assistant accountant-general (retired) in the Central Government of India, and [[Narla Tata Rao]], a doyen of the power sector in India and a former chairman of the [[Transmission Corporation of Andhra Pradesh|Andhra Pradesh State Electricity Board]].\n\nFor the early part of his life, Rao's parents home-schooled him and admitted him to the seventh grade directly. He completed formal school at the early age of 13. Thereafter, he went on to study intermediate at the newly established [[Andhra Loyola College]] at [[Vijayawada]] and moved over to Osmania University, Hyderabad for higher education.  At the young age of 19 years, in 1961, Rao graduated with a master's degree in Physics from the [[Osmania University]] in Hyderabad India. Thereafter, in 1963, Rao graduated from the [[Indian Institute of Sciences]], Bangalore, with a B.E. degree in Metallurgy. During his second year at I.I.Sc Bangalore, Rao was supported by the Dorabji Tata Trust. His long association with the Banaras Hindu University (B.H.U) began soon afterwards, when his mentor [[T.R. Anantharaman]] encouraged him to enroll in the doctoral program at the Department of Metallurgical Engineering at B.H.U (now [[Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi]]). Rao's pioneering doctoral dissertation in [[Rapid Solidification]] laid the foundation for the research in this area in India.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} He obtained his MSc in 1965 and PhD in 1968.\n\n==Research contributions==\nRao pioneered research activities in the area of rapid solidification, an area pertaining to the solidification of liquids at the rate of a million degrees per second, in India in the mid 1960s. Such a process leads to the formation of extensive [[solid solution]]s, metastable intermediate phases and [[metallic glass]]es. He was the first outside the United States of America to conduct research in this technologically important area.  Rao discovered novel intermetallic phases and also the hitherto unexpected phases with 5-fold rotational symmetry. His interests then shifted to identifying the theoretical basis of the formation of such phases and he began to model their formation from a [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] standpoint. Some of the expressions developed for the free energy of undercooled liquids are being used extensively by modellers. The techniques of rapid solidification which were once a matter of scientific curiosity have now been industrially exploited by the advanced countries in the form of novel metallic glass-based transformer core materials, fine grained high strength alloys, new hard magnetic materials etc.  Many noteworthy contributions made by Rao, his students and erstwhile colleagues at the Banaras Hindu University have brought immense recognition to India as an important centre for rapid solidification studies.\n\nIn the past decade, Rao's interests shifted to the synthesis of materials by following routes which are very similar to those practised by living organisms. This new area of investigation aptly called [[biomimetics]] has the potential of avoiding environmental pollution and energy expenditure. Most methods operate at room temperature and ambient pressure. Prof. Ramachandra Rao and his students and colleagues have successfully synthesised calcium carbonate, calcium hydroxy apatite and some metallic [[nanocrystals]] through this route. The calcium hydroxy apatite has the potential for prosthetic applications. Animal studies involving rabbits have been conducted at the Banaras Hindu University. One of Rao's students has commercialised the apatite powders for dental applications.\n\nBesides biomimetics he has also worked on ceramic materials and their production by self-propagating high temperature synthesis (SHS). Other routes for nanomaterial synthesis were also explored. Studies were also conducted on natural [[composite materials]] like bamboo and synthetic composites and steels.\n\nSince retirement Rao had been pursuing theoretical studies involving the specific heats of about eleven metals which undergo the hexagonal to body centred cubic phase transformation. He and his associates had discovered some systematics in the thermodynamic properties of these metals but a real solution to the problem has evaded them for over 25 years.\n\n=== Association with national and international bodies ===\nRao was a fellow of all four science and engineering academies of the country: [[Indian Academy of Sciences]], [[Indian National Science Academy]], [[National Academy of Sciences, India]], and [[Indian National Academy of Engineering]]. He was also a fellow of The [[Academy of Sciences for the Developing World]]. He served in the council of Indian National Science Academy from 1996\u201398 and was serving vice-president when he died.\n\nHe was also a fellow of the [[Institution of Engineers (India)|Institution of Engineers]]. He played pivoted role in the societies associated with his profession. He had served as president of the Indian Institute of Metals and vice-president of the Materials Research Society of India.\n\n=== Awards and honours ===\nRao received numerous honours and awards. The prominent among them are Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize of CSIR in 1985, INSA Prize for Materials Science in 1997, National Metallurgist Award in 2004 and Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Gold Medal of INSA in 2005. He received the Distinguished Alumnus Award of Indian Institute of Science as well as that of the Department of Metallurgy, Banaras Hindu University. He was a recipient of Nayudamma Award of CSIR in 1999. The engineering profession has recognised his contribution with Vasvik Award in 1997, Distinguished Engineer Award of Institution of Engineers and Om Prakash Bhasin Award in 1998. For his contribution to the first Indian space experiment, he was awarded Inter Cosmos Medal of USSR in 1984.\n\nRao was a Platinum Jubilee lecturer of Materials Science Section of [[Indian Science Congress]] at [[Goa]] in 1993, Prof. Brahm Prakash Memorial Lecturer at Indian Institute of Science in 2000 and both Daya Swarup and N.P.

He has the unique distinction of being the only Vice-Chancellor (2002\u201305) of the [[Banaras Hindu University]] (BHU) who was also a student (1963\u201368) and faculty (1964\u201392) at that institution. From 1992 to 2002, Rao was the Director of the [[National Metallurgical Laboratory]], [[Jamshedpur]]. After his tenure as Vice-Chancellor of B.H.U., in 2005, he took the reins of the [[Defence Institute of Advanced Technology]] (DIAT) as its first Vice-Chancellor. He was to serve DIAT until his superannuation in 2007. From 2007 till the end, Rao was a Raja Ramanna Fellow at the [[International Advanced Research Centre for Powder Metallurgy and New Materials]], in [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], Andhra Pradesh.\n\n==Early years==\nRao was born on 21 March 1942 to S. R. Narayanaswamy Naidu and Laxmi Bai at Kavutavaram in the Krishna District of [[Andhra Pradesh]]. His father Narayanaswamy Naidu, was a government servant and retired as Deputy Registrar of Co-operative Societies while his mother, Laxmi Bai was also educated and studied up to matriculation when very few women were going to school. From his mother's side, Rao is the nephew of [[Narla Venkateswara Rao]], a [[Telugu language]] writer, journalist and politician from Andhra Pradesh, Narla Gowri Shankar Rao, an assistant accountant-general (retired) in the Central Government of India, and [[Narla Tata Rao]], a doyen of the power sector in India and a former chairman of the [[Transmission Corporation of Andhra Pradesh|Andhra Pradesh State Electricity Board]].\n\nFor the early part of his life, Rao's parents home-schooled him and admitted him to the seventh grade directly. He completed formal school at the early age of 13. Thereafter, he went on to study intermediate at the newly established [[Andhra Loyola College]] at [[Vijayawada]] and moved over to Osmania University, Hyderabad for higher education.  At the young age of 19 years, in 1961, Rao graduated with a master's degree in Physics from the [[Osmania University]] in Hyderabad India. Thereafter, in 1963, Rao graduated from the [[Indian Institute of Sciences]], Bangalore, with a B.E. degree in Metallurgy. During his second year at I.I.Sc Bangalore, Rao was supported by the Dorabji Tata Trust. His long association with the Banaras Hindu University (B.H.U) began soon afterwards, when his mentor [[T.R. Anantharaman]] encouraged him to enroll in the doctoral program at the Department of Metallurgical Engineering at B.H.U (now [[Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi]]). Rao's pioneering doctoral dissertation in [[Rapid Solidification]] laid the foundation for the research in this area in India.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} He obtained his MSc in 1965 and PhD in 1968.\n\n==Research contributions==\nRao pioneered research activities in the area of rapid solidification, an area pertaining to the solidification of liquids at the rate of a million degrees per second, in India in the mid 1960s. Such a process leads to the formation of extensive [[solid solution]]s, metastable intermediate phases and [[metallic glass]]es. He was the first outside the United States of America to conduct research in this technologically important area.  Rao discovered novel intermetallic phases and also the hitherto unexpected phases with 5-fold rotational symmetry. His interests then shifted to identifying the theoretical basis of the formation of such phases and he began to model their formation from a [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] standpoint. Some of the expressions developed for the free energy of undercooled liquids are being used extensively by modellers. The techniques of rapid solidification which were once a matter of scientific curiosity have now been industrially exploited by the advanced countries in the form of novel metallic glass-based transformer core materials, fine grained high strength alloys, new hard magnetic materials etc.  Many noteworthy contributions made by Rao, his students and erstwhile colleagues at the Banaras Hindu University have brought immense recognition to India as an important centre for rapid solidification studies.\n\nIn the past decade, Rao's interests shifted to the synthesis of materials by following routes which are very similar to those practised by living organisms. This new area of investigation aptly called [[biomimetics]] has the potential of avoiding environmental pollution and energy expenditure. Most methods operate at room temperature and ambient pressure. Prof. Ramachandra Rao and his students and colleagues have successfully synthesised calcium carbonate, calcium hydroxy apatite and some metallic [[nanocrystals]] through this route. The calcium hydroxy apatite has the potential for prosthetic applications. Animal studies involving rabbits have been conducted at the Banaras Hindu University. One of Rao's students has commercialised the apatite powders for dental applications.\n\nBesides biomimetics he has also worked on ceramic materials and their production by self-propagating high temperature synthesis (SHS). Other routes for nanomaterial synthesis were also explored. Studies were also conducted on natural [[composite materials]] like bamboo and synthetic composites and steels.\n\nSince retirement Rao had been pursuing theoretical studies involving the specific heats of about eleven metals which undergo the hexagonal to body centred cubic phase transformation. He and his associates had discovered some systematics in the thermodynamic properties of these metals but a real solution to the problem has evaded them for over 25 years.\n\n=== Association with national and international bodies ===\nRao was a fellow of all four science and engineering academies of the country: [[Indian Academy of Sciences]], [[Indian National Science Academy]], [[National Academy of Sciences, India]], and [[Indian National Academy of Engineering]]. He was also a fellow of The [[Academy of Sciences for the Developing World]]. He served in the council of Indian National Science Academy from 1996\u201398 and was serving vice-president when he died.\n\nHe was also a fellow of the [[Institution of Engineers (India)|Institution of Engineers]]. He played pivoted role in the societies associated with his profession. He had served as president of the Indian Institute of Metals and vice-president of the Materials Research Society of India.\n\n=== Awards and honours ===\nRao received numerous honours and awards. The prominent among them are Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize of CSIR in 1985, INSA Prize for Materials Science in 1997, National Metallurgist Award in 2004 and Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Gold Medal of INSA in 2005. He received the Distinguished Alumnus Award of Indian Institute of Science as well as that of the Department of Metallurgy, Banaras Hindu University. He was a recipient of Nayudamma Award of CSIR in 1999. The engineering profession has recognised his contribution with Vasvik Award in 1997, Distinguished Engineer Award of Institution of Engineers and Om Prakash Bhasin Award in 1998. For his contribution to the first Indian space experiment, he was awarded Inter Cosmos Medal of USSR in 1984.\n\nRao was a Platinum Jubilee lecturer of Materials Science Section of [[Indian Science Congress]] at [[Goa]] in 1993, Prof. Brahm Prakash Memorial Lecturer at Indian Institute of Science in 2000 and both Daya Swarup and N.P. Gandhi Memorial Lecturer of the Indian Institute of Metals in 1998 and 2004 respectively.\n\n==Personal life==\n\n=== Family ===\nDr. Rao was married to Sudha Rao in 1966. In his own words, \"''she has been a great support to me and let me pursue my professional life without any worry of running the family. She was herself an employee of [[Andhra Bank]].

The firehouse was originally built in 1932 for Engine Company 261 and Ladder Company 116. \n\nEngine Company 261 was established in 1894 as [[Long Island City Fire Department]]'s Engine Company 3, and was renumbered in 1913. Engine Company 261 served both Long Island City and the nearby community of [[Roosevelt Island]] until 2003, until it was closed as a cost-saving measure, while Ladder Company 116 still operates out of the firehouse. Fire officials, local residents, and business owners have argued that the engine company should be re-opened.\n\n== Building ==\nConstruction of the present firehouse at 29th Street started in the 1930s. After the foundation was completed, work was halted by early 1932 because the [[New York City Comptroller]], [[Charles W. Berry]], had failed to allocate funds for construction.<ref name=\"NYDN-Delay-1932\"/> Berry approved construction contracts for the firehouse in late March 1932.<ref name=\"BTE-Approve-1932\"/> The building opened in November 1932 and was the first firehouse in Queens with its own water tower. Upon the opening of the 29th Street firehouse, Engine Co. 261 and Ladder Co. 116 vacated their former headquarters at 38-08 28th Street, one block away.<ref name=\"NYDN-Open-1932\"/>\n\n== Engine Company 261 ==\nEngine Company 261 was established as Long Island City Fire Department's Engine Company 3 in 1894. It was renumbered after Long Island City was annexed by New York City in 1913.<ref name=\"nyfdEngine261\" /> \n\nIn 2003, Engine Company 261 was closed as a cost-saving measure.<ref name=\"nypost2019-01-14\" /> The closure was one of six announced by [[Michael Bloomberg]], on May 26, 2003.<ref name=\"Nytimes2003-05-26\" /> At the time of its closure it had served both Long Island City and nearby [[Roosevelt Island]].<ref name=\"Qns2018-12-21\" /> ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted how residents who lived near the closed stations expressed various degrees of distress, with some other closures triggering greater distress.<ref name=\"Nytimes2003-05-26\" /> \n\nIn June 2017, [[New York City Council]] member [[Jimmy Van Bramer]] and local residents started to advocate for Engine Company 261's reopening, citing large population growth in Long Island City.<ref name=\"CBS-Calls-2017\"/> Representatives of the Fire Fighter's Association said that the population of the station's service area had grown from 60,000 when it was closed to 200,000 in 2015.<ref name=\"Qns2018-12-21\" />  Efforts to reopen the engine company increased in late 2018 and early 2019, after [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] had announced that it had chosen a site near the station to house their massive new headquarters,  [[Amazon HQ2]].<ref name=\"nypost2019-01-14\" /><ref name=\"Cbs2018-12-19\" /><ref name=\"Spectrum2018-12-20\" /><ref name=licpost2019-01-17/><ref name=6sqft2019-01-15/> Assemblywoman [[Catherine Nolan]] pointed out that when mayor [[Bill de Blasio]] was a city councilman, he had also argued for reopening the station.<ref name=\"Fox5ny\" /> Other advocates of Engine Company 261's reinstatement included U.S. representative [[Carolyn Maloney]], whose [[New York's 12th congressional district|12th congressional district]] included Roosevelt Island and Long Island City.<ref name=\"QDE-Petition-2018\"/> However, plans for reopening the engine company were postponed in mid-2019 after the cancellation of the New York City campus of Amazon HQ2.<ref name=\"Fox5ny2019-08-23\" />\n\n== Ladder Company 116 ==\nLadder Company 116 still operates within the firehouse. The difference between the two companies is that the ladder company focuses on rescuing occupants of buildings on fire, while the engine companies focus on actually fighting fire.<ref name=\"Qns2018-12-21\" /><ref name=\"Fox5ny2019-08-23\" /><ref name=\"LIC-Call-2018\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs= \n<ref name=6sqft2019-01-15>\n{{cite news     \n| url         = https://www.6sqft.com/fdny-says-amazons-hq2-may-overwhelm-an-already-stretched-lic-fire-department/\n| title       = FDNY says Amazon\u2019s HQ2 may overwhelm an already stretched LIC fire department\n| work        = [[6 sqft]]\n| author      = Michelle Cohen\n| date        = January 15, 2019\n| archiveurl  = \n| archivedate = \n| accessdate  = November 13, 2019\n| url-status  = live\n| quote       = Chief Sudnik said the community district once served by Engine 261 showed a 19 percent increase in emergency calls to the FDNY between 2014 and 2018; the department\u2019s response times over the same period became 9 percent slower.

The firehouse was originally built in 1932 for Engine Company 261 and Ladder Company 116. \n\nEngine Company 261 was established in 1894 as [[Long Island City Fire Department]]'s Engine Company 3, and was renumbered in 1913. Engine Company 261 served both Long Island City and the nearby community of [[Roosevelt Island]] until 2003, until it was closed as a cost-saving measure, while Ladder Company 116 still operates out of the firehouse. Fire officials, local residents, and business owners have argued that the engine company should be re-opened.\n\n== Building ==\nConstruction of the present firehouse at 29th Street started in the 1930s. After the foundation was completed, work was halted by early 1932 because the [[New York City Comptroller]], [[Charles W. Berry]], had failed to allocate funds for construction.<ref name=\"NYDN-Delay-1932\"/> Berry approved construction contracts for the firehouse in late March 1932.<ref name=\"BTE-Approve-1932\"/> The building opened in November 1932 and was the first firehouse in Queens with its own water tower. Upon the opening of the 29th Street firehouse, Engine Co. 261 and Ladder Co. 116 vacated their former headquarters at 38-08 28th Street, one block away.<ref name=\"NYDN-Open-1932\"/>\n\n== Engine Company 261 ==\nEngine Company 261 was established as Long Island City Fire Department's Engine Company 3 in 1894. It was renumbered after Long Island City was annexed by New York City in 1913.<ref name=\"nyfdEngine261\" /> \n\nIn 2003, Engine Company 261 was closed as a cost-saving measure.<ref name=\"nypost2019-01-14\" /> The closure was one of six announced by [[Michael Bloomberg]], on May 26, 2003.<ref name=\"Nytimes2003-05-26\" /> At the time of its closure it had served both Long Island City and nearby [[Roosevelt Island]].<ref name=\"Qns2018-12-21\" /> ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted how residents who lived near the closed stations expressed various degrees of distress, with some other closures triggering greater distress.<ref name=\"Nytimes2003-05-26\" /> \n\nIn June 2017, [[New York City Council]] member [[Jimmy Van Bramer]] and local residents started to advocate for Engine Company 261's reopening, citing large population growth in Long Island City.<ref name=\"CBS-Calls-2017\"/> Representatives of the Fire Fighter's Association said that the population of the station's service area had grown from 60,000 when it was closed to 200,000 in 2015.<ref name=\"Qns2018-12-21\" />  Efforts to reopen the engine company increased in late 2018 and early 2019, after [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] had announced that it had chosen a site near the station to house their massive new headquarters,  [[Amazon HQ2]].<ref name=\"nypost2019-01-14\" /><ref name=\"Cbs2018-12-19\" /><ref name=\"Spectrum2018-12-20\" /><ref name=licpost2019-01-17/><ref name=6sqft2019-01-15/> Assemblywoman [[Catherine Nolan]] pointed out that when mayor [[Bill de Blasio]] was a city councilman, he had also argued for reopening the station.<ref name=\"Fox5ny\" /> Other advocates of Engine Company 261's reinstatement included U.S. representative [[Carolyn Maloney]], whose [[New York's 12th congressional district|12th congressional district]] included Roosevelt Island and Long Island City.<ref name=\"QDE-Petition-2018\"/> However, plans for reopening the engine company were postponed in mid-2019 after the cancellation of the New York City campus of Amazon HQ2.<ref name=\"Fox5ny2019-08-23\" />\n\n== Ladder Company 116 ==\nLadder Company 116 still operates within the firehouse. The difference between the two companies is that the ladder company focuses on rescuing occupants of buildings on fire, while the engine companies focus on actually fighting fire.<ref name=\"Qns2018-12-21\" /><ref name=\"Fox5ny2019-08-23\" /><ref name=\"LIC-Call-2018\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs= \n<ref name=6sqft2019-01-15>\n{{cite news     \n| url         = https://www.6sqft.com/fdny-says-amazons-hq2-may-overwhelm-an-already-stretched-lic-fire-department/\n| title       = FDNY says Amazon\u2019s HQ2 may overwhelm an already stretched LIC fire department\n| work        = [[6 sqft]]\n| author      = Michelle Cohen\n| date        = January 15, 2019\n| archiveurl  = \n| archivedate = \n| accessdate  = November 13, 2019\n| url-status  = live\n| quote       = Chief Sudnik said the community district once served by Engine 261 showed a 19 percent increase in emergency calls to the FDNY between 2014 and 2018; the department\u2019s response times over the same period became 9 percent slower.
