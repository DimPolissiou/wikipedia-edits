This series saw Dec involved in an accident during filming of a game being pre-recorded for an episode's \"Ant vs. Dec\", in which the presenter was injured while attempting a motorbike stunt jump. The accident left him with a broken right thumb and broken left elbow, leaving him to have his left arm in a sling for a few weeks afterwards.

This series saw the game \"Jiggy Bank\" being replaced with a new cash prize game entitled \"The Mouse Trap\".\n\nFor this series' contest between the presenters, the format was modified so that each presenter could be joined by a team of celebrities to help them win games. Whoever lost had to nominate a celebrity from their team who would be eliminated from future games. Ant's team consisted of: Paul Daniels' wife [[Debbie McGee]]; actress and singer [[Bonnie Langford]]; dancer [[Wayne Sleep]]; [[Jason \"J\" Brown]] from [[Five (band)|Five]]; and ex-[[Steps (group)|Steps]] member [[Lee Latchford-Evans]] (due to \"personal reasons\" Ant's initial choice of [[Lee Ryan]] from [[Blue (boy band)|Blue]] could not take part as planned). Dec's team consisted of: magician [[Paul Daniels]]; singer [[Sonia (singer)|Sonia]]; ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'' contestant [[Chico Slimani]]; TV presenter [[Melinda Messenger]]; and former footballer [[Lee Sharpe]]. The contest between the teams ended on a draw of 3-3, leading to a tie-breaker game of a basketball shoot-out to be held in the final episode to determine the winner. For this game, each presenter nominated a team member to play it, and was won by Dec's team, leading to the presenter winning this series' contest as a result.

This series is notable for two elements in its broadcast. The first was that its series finale took place outside the [[United Kingdom]], on the [[MV Britannia (2015)|MV Britannia]], while it was berthed in [[Barcelona]] - tickets for places on the cruise ship were offered during the other episodes as prizes, courtesy of the ship's operator [[P&O Cruises]] with tickets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/ant-decs-saturday-night-takeaway|title=Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway 2016|publisher=ITV Press Centre|work=itv.com|date=3 February 2016|accessdate=5 February 2016}}</ref> The second was that it featured a live wedding in the sixth episode, between a couple who had written to the production team asking if they could be married on the programme.\n\nThe series introduced two new segments. The first, entitled \"Best Seats in the House\", offered places in the studio audience for the next episode, in a specially marked \"VIP\" section, with the exception of the first episode were the seats were given to selected members of the audience; for the penultimate episode, the viewers were given tickets for the cruise ship. The second involved a mini-serial \"whodunnit\" comedy drama entitled \"Who Shot Simon Cowell?\", written by ''[[Broadchurch]]'' creator [[Chris Chibnall]], and starred [[Ant & Dec]], [[Simon Cowell]], [[Louis Walsh]], [[Amanda Holden]], [[Alesha Dixon]], [[David Walliams]], [[Piers Morgan]], [[Olly Murs]], the late [[Caroline Flack]] and [[Ashleigh and Pudsey|Pudsey the Dog]] as themselves, and [[Kevin Whately]] and [[Emilia Fox]] as their respective characters from ''[[Lewis (TV series)|Lewis]]'' and ''[[Silent Witness]]''. The mini-serial was later condensed into a single episode that was broadcast on 30 December 2017. Amongst the other segments for the show, the game \"Win the Ads\" received a minor change in its format, reducing the number of prizes that contestants could win in total, while final episode saw the game having the contestant chosen in the final episode was from those on the cruise ship, excluding anyone who won their place via ticket giveaway, and focusing on questions associated with being at sea.\n\nApart from the mini-serial, this series featured guest appearances by [[Kym Marsh]], [[Jane Danson]], [[Sally Dynevor]], [[Shayne Ward]], [[Jack P. Shepherd]], [[Leona Lewis]], [[Bring Me the Horizon]] and [[Fleur East]], along with appearances by YouTubers [[Alfie Deyes]] and [[Marcus Butler]]. The series also featured opening performances by [[Wet Wet Wet]], [[Bryan Adams]],<ref name=\"radiotimes.com1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/dz2k5x/ant--decs-saturday-night-takeaway--series-13-episode-2|title=Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway|work=RadioTimes}}</ref> [[Anastacia]], and [[Peter Andre]], while \"Singalong Live\" featured appearances by Adams, [[Jess Glynne]], [[Craig David]] and [[Katherine Jenkins]]. For this series' contest between the presenters, the segment was hosted by [[Stephen Mulhern]], replacing Roberts who took to hosting the segment \"Best Seats\", and was won by Dec with a score of 4-1.

Like the previous series, the final episode took place outside of the United Kingdom, being broadcast live from [[Walt Disney World]] in [[Orlando, Florida]], with tickets for places in that episode's audience being offered throughout the series. This series saw the introduction of two short-lived segments - \"Make 'Em Laugh\" and \"In For A Penny\" - while the segment \"Best Seat in the House\" was presented by [[Scarlett Moffatt]], after Roberts opted to not return to the show for a new series, and the stars of \"Little Ant & Dec\" now featured across the show and online, rather than in a dedicated segment. The game segment \"Win the Ads\" was also modified in this series, with it now featuring a viewer competition, in which those taking part competed against each other answered the same questions for a chance to win \u00a31,000; in the fourth and sixth episode, technical difficulties prevented the competition from being used.\n\nLike the previous series, a new mini-serial comedy drama was shown during this series broadcast, entitled \"The Missing Crown Jewels\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-01-26/ant-and-dec-reveal-details-of-saturday-night-takeaway-follow-up-to-who-shot-simon-cowell|title=Ant and Dec reveal details of Saturday Night Takeaway follow-up to Who Shot Simon Cowell?|publisher=}}</ref> starring [[Ant and Dec]], [[Emilia Fox]], [[Joanna Lumley]], [[Cat Deeley]], [[Aled Jones]], [[Alan Titchmarsh]], [[Gareth Malone]], [[Martin Lewis (financial journalist)|Martin Lewis]], [[Clare Balding]], [[Carol Vorderman]], [[Shirley Bassey]], [[Ian \"H\" Watkins]], [[Alan Shearer]], [[Jessica Ennis-Hill]], and [[Michael Sheen]], and which was later condensed into a single episode on 23 December 2017. [[Alfie Deyes]] & [[Marcus Butler]] didn\u2019t return after 1 series. This series also saw the introduction on an online game called \"Ant & Dec vs. YouTubers\", in which the presenters took on a pair of YouTubers on Wednesday during the series' broadcast, with filmed clips placed on the show's official [[YouTube]] channel. \n\nApart from the mini-serial, this series featured opening performances in a number of episodes by [[Robbie Williams]], [[Kaiser Chiefs]], [[Take That]], [[Louisa Johnson]], with the exception of the final episode in which the presenters performed a special rendition of the song ''[[Be Our Guest (Disney song)|Be Our Guest]]''. For \"Songalong Live\", it featured performances by [[Steps (group)|Steps]], [[Louisa Johnson]], [[CeeLo Green]], and was unique for a number of factors: one of the contestants who took part was [[Freddie Flintoff]], the episode's celebrity announcer, who was tasked with playing along in the game, with his success winning everyone in the studio audience tickets to the [[Steps (group)|Steps]]' comeback tour; for the sixth episode, the song used was \"[[Let It Go (Disney song)|Let It Go]]\", as a prize of a \"Place on the Plane\" for the series finale at Walt Disney World the following week was on offer in addition to the usual \u00a3500.

Like the previous series, the series finale took place outside of the UK at [[Universal Orlando|Universal Orlando Resort]] with tickets for places in this episode offered through the series, while it was the last series to be broadcast live from London Studios before its closure for redevelopment later in the year. This series saw \"Little Ant & Dec\" discontinued, owing to the production team deciding that the young actors for this segment had outgrown their roles and thus should be allowed to focus on their education, while \"Ant & Dec Undercover\" was restricted to just one episode, owing to the massive and complex amount of preparation done to film the segment. This series aired its 100th episode, which celebrated this milestone by featuring highlights from the last 99 episodes of ''Saturday Night Takeaway'', along with a one-off revival of the segment \"Home-Run\", and a special edition of \"Win the Ads\", hosted by [[Emma Willis]], in which the presenters tackled the game themselves on behalf of a studio audience member randomly chosen before the episode's broadcast.\n\nAs like the previous series, it features a mini-serial comedy drama entitled \"Saturday Knight Takeaway\", to be aired during the series' broadcast. The mini-serial features a large cast of celebrities: Ant & Dec, [[Holly Willoughby]], [[Phillip Schofield]], [[Olly Murs]], [[David Walliams]], [[Katie Price]], [[Emilia Fox]], [[Joanna Lumley]], [[Aled Jones]], [[Alan Titchmarsh]], [[Gareth Malone]], [[Martin Lewis (financial journalist)|Martin Lewis]], [[Clare Balding]], [[Carol Vorderman]], [[Shirley Bassey]], [[Ian \"H\" Watkins]], [[Alan Shearer]], [[Jessica Ennis-Hill]], and [[Michael Sheen]].<!-- Add to this information on the mini-serial's cast, as it becomes available.--> Apart from the mini-serial, the series featured opening performances from [[Kylie Minogue]], [[George Ezra]], [[Paloma Faith]], as well as a special rendition of [[Everybody Needs Somebody to Love]] for the series finale. For \"Singalong Live\", it featured performances by [[Sophie Ellis-Bextor]], [[The Script]], and [[The Rembrandts]].<!-- Amend this line to focus on appearances for Opening Performances and Singalong Live respectively.-->\n\nThis series is notable for being affected greatly by the absence of [[Anthony McPartlin]] following the fourth episode, after he was involved in a traffic accident on 18 March 2018, connected to drink-driving, which led to him suspending further presenting duties the following day for the rest of the series and other programmes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-43463889|title= Ant McPartlin steps down from TV shows and seeks treatment|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 March 2018}}</ref> As a direct result, it led to an episode that was planned for the 24 March 2018 to be cancelled by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], and the discontinuation of \"Ant vs. Dec\" for the rest of the series. However, its most significant impact, was that it led to [[Declan Donnelly]] hosting the remaining two episodes by himself, the first time he had presented a programme in 30 years without McPartlin,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-43487792|title=Dec to present Saturday Night Takeaway without Ant|publisher=BBC|accessdate=21 March 2018}}</ref> with his co-presenters [[Stephen Mulhern]] and [[Scarlett Moffatt]] receiving expanded roles in these episodes. Although absent, McPartlin appeared in these episodes but solely within the pre-recorded editions of the mini-serial \"Saturday Knight Takeaway\". The decision to continue the series after the incident had occurred was primarily down to the presenters and the production team choosing not to cancel tickets made out to people who had secured a place within the audience for the series finale in Florida.

It was also the first to be broadcast from their new home at [[Television Centre, London]] following the closure of [[The London Studios]] in 2018. [[Stephen Mulhern]] returned to host the ''Ant vs. Dec'' segment, which for this series had a \"global\" theme to all of the challenges. However, [[Scarlett Moffatt]] did not return to the show as she left to focus on other TV projects, and was not replaced.\n\nThis series saw a new mini-serial entitled ''Men in Brown'' starring Ant & Dec still serving as undercover agents for ''The Honoured'' and tasked with saving the world from an alien invasion. [[Phillip Schofield|Philip Schofield]], [[Holly Willoughby]], [[Emily Atack]], [[Amanda Holden]], [[Love Island (2015 TV series, series 5)|Amber Gill]], [[Simon Cowell]], [[Richard Ayoade]], [[Paddy McGuinness]], and [[Hugh Bonneville]] (replacing [[Emilia Fox]] and [[Joanna Lumley]] as the head of ''The Honoured'') are guest starring in the mini-serial.\n\nAnother new segment called ''Don't Feed the Pandas'', involved Ant & Dec dressing up in realistic prosthetic panda costumes in an attempt to fool school kids at [[London Zoo]]. Other features returning from the previous series include ''I'm a Celebrity...Get Out of Me Ear!'' and ''Undercover''. ''Win the Ads'' also returned with a minor tweak in its format, the viewers competition used in the previous two series was discontinued and instead, one of the 16 prizes on the board would be won not just by the contestant but for the entire studio audience as well.\n\nThe first ''I'm a Celebrity...Get Out of Me Ear!'' of the series was with American actor [[Mark Wahlberg]] at [[Wahlburgers|his London restaurant]] where he pranked members of the public with the help of Ant & Dec talking into an ear piece. The first \"End of the Show\" - Show marked the return of [[Ashley Roberts]] with [[The Pussycat Dolls]] to the show she left after Series 14 in 2017. The second ''I'm a Celebrity...Get Out of Me Ear!'' was with British Boxer and \"[[List of world heavyweight boxing champions|Heavyweight Champion of the World]]\" [[Anthony Joshua]] at his local boxing club where pranked three members of the public by saying that the were going to be his personal chief with the help of Ant & Dec talking into an ear piece. The third ''I'm a Celebrity...Get Out of Me Ear!'' was done with British singer-songwriter and DJ [[Craig David]].  \n\n[[Andi Peters]] has been presenting the competition segment, which in the first episode was live from [[Bermuda, Warwickshire|Bermuda]], [[Nuneaton]], in the second episode was live from [[New York, Tyne and Wear|New York]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and in the fourth episode was live from [[Melbourne, Derbyshire|Melbourne]], [[Derbyshire]]. He was back in the studio for episode five. In the second episode, [[Fleur East]] gave some tickets for a ''Place on the Plane'' to a winning family in [[Bristol]] and in the fourth episode Fleur East visited [[Kingston upon Hull]] where the family who guessed the restaurant correctly (which was Papas [[Fish and chip shop|Fish and Chips shop]] in Kingston upon Hull) won another ''Place on the Plane''. \n\nThe ''Place on the Plane'' giveaway was again announced on the first show of the series, with the series finale location revealed as [[Walt Disney World]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Florida]] for the second time (having previously hosted the series finale in Series 14). It was also confirmed it would be the largest ever giveaway by a British television programme with 300 guests being invited to be the audience for the show this was done in partnership with [[Virgin Atlantic]]. However, on 13 March, it was announced that due to the ongoing [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] that the finale would be cancelled and the ticket holders would instead enjoy a 5-star hotel stay at the park at a later date. Following viewer complaints about the 14 March episode still having a live [[audience]] despite the coronavirus pandemic and the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Boris Johnson]] advising against all [[Mass gathering|mass gatherings]] in an effort to slow down the spread, [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] confirmed on 17 March that the remaining episodes of the series would be shot without a live audience and with a [[skeleton crew|reduced production crew]], with a shorter 60-minute running time for the 28 March episode.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/51918401|title=Coronavirus: Prime Minister advises against mass gatherings|date=2020-03-16|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2020-03-17|language=en-gb}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tellymix.co.uk/tv/437524-saturday-night-takeaway-crisis-talks-over-future-of-the-series-amid-coronavirus-outbreak.html|title=Saturday Night Takeaway 'crisis talks' over future of the series amid coronavirus outbreak|last=Darvill|first=Josh|date=2020-03-17|website=TellyMix|language=en|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/17/ant-decs-saturday-night-takeaway-continue-without-audience-12414416/|title=Ant and Dec\u2019s Saturday Night Takeaway to continue without an audience|last=Deen|first=Sarah|date=2020-03-18|website=Metro|language=en|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>\nIt was later revealed on Twitter that the 28 March episode would take place live from their living rooms, whilst on a video call with each other.

This series is notable for the production team revamping the \"What's Next\" segment, and transforming it into a head-to-head contest between the presenters entitled \"Ant vs. Dec\", that was presented by [[Kirsty Gallacher]]. This series saw Dec involved in an accident during filming of a game being pre-recorded for an episode's \"Ant vs. Dec\", in which the presenter was injured while attempting a motorbike stunt jump. The accident left him with a broken right thumb and broken left elbow, leaving him to have his left arm in a sling for a few weeks afterwards. In its first run, the contest between the presenters ended with Dec winning by 6\u20135.\nSponsorship: [[KFC]].\n\n'''Ratings'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! Episode !!

The segment was now presented by American singer [[Ashley Roberts]], replacing Gallacher, was aired in only five episodes of the series, and ended with Ant winning the contest for the first time, on a score of 3-2.\n\n'''Ratings'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Like the previous series, the final episode took place outside of the United Kingdom, being broadcast live from [[Walt Disney World]] in [[Orlando, Florida]], with tickets for places in that episode's audience being offered throughout the series. This series saw the introduction of two short-lived segments - \"Make 'Em Laugh\" and \"In For A Penny\" - while the segment \"Best Seat in the House\" was presented by [[Scarlett Moffatt]], after Roberts opted to not return to the show for a new series, and the stars of \"Little Ant & Dec\" now featured across the show and online, rather than in a dedicated segment. The game segment \"Win the Ads\" was also modified in this series, with it now featuring a viewer competition, in which those taking part competed against each other answered the same questions for a chance to win \u00a31,000; in the fourth and sixth episode, technical difficulties prevented the competition from being used.\n\nLike the previous series, a new mini-serial comedy drama was shown during this series broadcast, entitled \"The Missing Crown Jewels\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-01-26/ant-and-dec-reveal-details-of-saturday-night-takeaway-follow-up-to-who-shot-simon-cowell|title=Ant and Dec reveal details of Saturday Night Takeaway follow-up to Who Shot Simon Cowell?|publisher=}}</ref> starring [[Ant and Dec]], [[Emilia Fox]], [[Joanna Lumley]], [[Cat Deeley]], [[Aled Jones]], [[Alan Titchmarsh]], [[Gareth Malone]], [[Martin Lewis (financial journalist)|Martin Lewis]], [[Clare Balding]], [[Carol Vorderman]], [[Shirley Bassey]], [[Ian \"H\" Watkins]], [[Alan Shearer]], [[Jessica Ennis-Hill]], and [[Michael Sheen]], and which was later condensed into a single episode on 23 December 2017. [[Alfie Deyes]] & [[Marcus Butler]] didn\u2019t return after 1 series. This series also saw the introduction on an online game called \"Ant & Dec vs. YouTubers\", in which the presenters took on a pair of YouTubers on Wednesday during the series' broadcast, with filmed clips placed on the show's official [[YouTube]] channel. \n\nApart from the mini-serial, this series featured opening performances in a number of episodes by [[Robbie Williams]], [[Kaiser Chiefs]], [[Take That]], [[Louisa Johnson]], with the exception of the final episode in which the presenters performed a special rendition of the song ''[[Be Our Guest (Disney song)|Be Our Guest]]''. For \"Songalong Live\", it featured performances by [[Steps (group)|Steps]], [[Louisa Johnson]], [[CeeLo Green]], and was unique for a number of factors: one of the contestants who took part was [[Freddie Flintoff]], the episode's celebrity announcer, who was tasked with playing along in the game, with his success winning everyone in the studio audience tickets to the [[Steps (group)|Steps]]' comeback tour; for the sixth episode, the song used was \"[[Let It Go (Disney song)|Let It Go]]\", as a prize of a \"Place on the Plane\" for the series finale at Walt Disney World the following week was on offer in addition to the usual \u00a3500. This series' contest between the presenter was won by Ant with a score of 3-1. Sponsorship: [[Suzuki]].\n\n'''Ratings'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! Episode !! Date !!

Like the previous series, the series finale took place outside of the UK at [[Universal Orlando|Universal Orlando Resort]] with tickets for places in this episode offered through the series, while it was the last series to be broadcast live from London Studios before its closure for redevelopment later in the year. This series saw \"Little Ant & Dec\" discontinued, owing to the production team deciding that the young actors for this segment had outgrown their roles and thus should be allowed to focus on their education, while \"Ant & Dec Undercover\" was restricted to just one episode, owing to the massive and complex amount of preparation done to film the segment. This series aired its 100th episode, which celebrated this milestone by featuring highlights from the last 99 episodes of ''Saturday Night Takeaway'', along with a one-off revival of the segment \"Home-Run\", and a special edition of \"Win the Ads\", hosted by [[Emma Willis]], in which the presenters tackled the game themselves on behalf of a studio audience member randomly chosen before the episode's broadcast.\n\nAs like the previous series, it features a mini-serial comedy drama entitled \"Saturday Knight Takeaway\", to be aired during the series' broadcast. The mini-serial features a large cast of celebrities: Ant & Dec, [[Holly Willoughby]], [[Phillip Schofield]], [[Olly Murs]], [[David Walliams]], [[Katie Price]], [[Emilia Fox]], [[Joanna Lumley]], [[Aled Jones]], [[Alan Titchmarsh]], [[Gareth Malone]], [[Martin Lewis (financial journalist)|Martin Lewis]], [[Clare Balding]], [[Carol Vorderman]], [[Shirley Bassey]], [[Ian \"H\" Watkins]], [[Alan Shearer]], [[Jessica Ennis-Hill]], and [[Michael Sheen]].<!-- Add to this information on the mini-serial's cast, as it becomes available.--> Apart from the mini-serial, the series featured opening performances from [[Kylie Minogue]], [[George Ezra]], [[Paloma Faith]], as well as a special rendition of [[Everybody Needs Somebody to Love]] for the series finale. For \"Singalong Live\", it featured performances by [[Sophie Ellis-Bextor]], [[The Script]], and [[The Rembrandts]].<!-- Amend this line to focus on appearances for Opening Performances and Singalong Live respectively.-->\n\nThis series is notable for being affected greatly by the absence of [[Anthony McPartlin]] following the fourth episode, after he was involved in a traffic accident on 18 March 2018, connected to drink-driving, which led to him suspending further presenting duties the following day for the rest of the series and other programmes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-43463889|title= Ant McPartlin steps down from TV shows and seeks treatment|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 March 2018}}</ref> As a direct result, it led to an episode that was planned for the 24 March 2018 to be cancelled by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], and the discontinuation of \"Ant vs. Dec\" for the rest of the series. However, its most significant impact, was that it led to [[Declan Donnelly]] hosting the remaining two episodes by himself, the first time he had presented a programme in 30 years without McPartlin,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-43487792|title=Dec to present Saturday Night Takeaway without Ant|publisher=BBC|accessdate=21 March 2018}}</ref> with his co-presenters [[Stephen Mulhern]] and [[Scarlett Moffatt]] receiving expanded roles in these episodes. Although absent, McPartlin appeared in these episodes but solely within the pre-recorded editions of the mini-serial \"Saturday Knight Takeaway\". The decision to continue the series after the incident had occurred was primarily down to the presenters and the production team choosing not to cancel tickets made out to people who had secured a place within the audience for the series finale in Florida.

It was also the first to be broadcast from their new home at [[Television Centre, London]] following the closure of [[The London Studios]] in 2018. [[Stephen Mulhern]] returned to host the ''Ant vs. Dec'' segment, which for this series had a \"global\" theme to all of the challenges. However, [[Scarlett Moffatt]] did not return to the show as she left to focus on other TV projects, and was not replaced.\n\nThis series saw a new mini-serial entitled ''Men in Brown'' starring Ant & Dec still serving as undercover agents for ''The Honoured'' and tasked with saving the world from an alien invasion. [[Phillip Schofield|Philip Schofield]], [[Holly Willoughby]], [[Emily Atack]], [[Amanda Holden]], [[Love Island (2015 TV series, series 5)|Amber Gill]], [[Simon Cowell]], [[Richard Ayoade]], [[Paddy McGuinness]], and [[Hugh Bonneville]] (replacing [[Emilia Fox]] and [[Joanna Lumley]] as the head of ''The Honoured'') are guest starring in the mini-serial.\n\nAnother new segment called ''Don't Feed the Pandas'', involved Ant & Dec dressing up in realistic prosthetic panda costumes in an attempt to fool school kids at [[London Zoo]]. Other features returning from the previous series include ''I'm a Celebrity...Get Out of Me Ear!'' and ''Undercover''. ''Win the Ads'' also returned with a minor tweak in its format, the viewers competition used in the previous two series was discontinued and instead, one of the 16 prizes on the board would be won not just by the contestant but for the entire studio audience as well.\n\nThe first ''I'm a Celebrity...Get Out of Me Ear!'' of the series was with American actor [[Mark Wahlberg]] at [[Wahlburgers|his London restaurant]] where he pranked members of the public with the help of Ant & Dec talking into an ear piece. The first \"End of the Show\" - Show marked the return of [[Ashley Roberts]] with [[The Pussycat Dolls]] to the show she left after Series 14 in 2017. The second ''I'm a Celebrity...Get Out of Me Ear!'' was with British Boxer and \"[[List of world heavyweight boxing champions|Heavyweight Champion of the World]]\" [[Anthony Joshua]] at his local boxing club where pranked three members of the public by saying that the were going to be his personal chief with the help of Ant & Dec talking into an ear piece. The third ''I'm a Celebrity...Get Out of Me Ear!'' was done with British singer-songwriter and DJ [[Craig David]].  \n\n[[Andi Peters]] has been presenting the competition segment, which in the first episode was live from [[Bermuda, Warwickshire|Bermuda]], [[Nuneaton]], in the second episode was live from [[New York, Tyne and Wear|New York]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and in the fourth episode was live from [[Melbourne, Derbyshire|Melbourne]], [[Derbyshire]]. He was back in the studio for episode five. In the second episode, [[Fleur East]] gave some tickets for a ''Place on the Plane'' to a winning family in [[Bristol]] and in the fourth episode Fleur East visited [[Kingston upon Hull]] where the family who guessed the restaurant correctly (which was Papas [[Fish and chip shop|Fish and Chips shop]] in Kingston upon Hull) won another ''Place on the Plane''. \n\nThe ''Place on the Plane'' giveaway was again announced on the first show of the series, with the series finale location revealed as [[Walt Disney World]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Florida]] for the second time (having previously hosted the series finale in Series 14). It was also confirmed it would be the largest ever giveaway by a British television programme with 300 guests being invited to be the audience for the show this was done in partnership with [[Virgin Atlantic]]. However, on 13 March, it was announced that due to the ongoing [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] that the finale would be cancelled and the ticket holders would instead enjoy a 5-star hotel stay at the park at a later date. Following viewer complaints about the 14 March episode still having a live [[audience]] despite the coronavirus pandemic and the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Boris Johnson]] advising against all [[Mass gathering|mass gatherings]] in an effort to slow down the spread, [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] confirmed on 17 March that the remaining episodes of the series would be shot without a live audience and with a [[skeleton crew|reduced production crew]], with a shorter 60-minute running time for the 28 March episode.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/51918401|title=Coronavirus: Prime Minister advises against mass gatherings|date=2020-03-16|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2020-03-17|language=en-gb}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tellymix.co.uk/tv/437524-saturday-night-takeaway-crisis-talks-over-future-of-the-series-amid-coronavirus-outbreak.html|title=Saturday Night Takeaway 'crisis talks' over future of the series amid coronavirus outbreak|last=Darvill|first=Josh|date=2020-03-17|website=TellyMix|language=en|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/17/ant-decs-saturday-night-takeaway-continue-without-audience-12414416/|title=Ant and Dec\u2019s Saturday Night Takeaway to continue without an audience|last=Deen|first=Sarah|date=2020-03-18|website=Metro|language=en|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>\nIt was later revealed on Twitter that the 28 March episode would take place live from their living rooms, whilst on a video call with each other.

Later at age 19, with no film-school training, he wrote and directed his first feature, the meager-budgeted (now cult) sci-fi film \u201c[[Time Chasers]]\u201d. Giancola then directed over twenty feature films and TV-movies including \u201c[[Icebreaker (film)|Icebreaker]]\u201d, \u201cLightning - Fire From The Sky\u201d, \u201cMoving Targets\u201d, \u201cLandslide\u201d, and \u201c[[Moonlight and Mistletoe|Moonlight & Mistletoe]]\u201d. Mr. Giancola was elected an IATSE 600 [[Cinematographer]] in 2002 and ran both the boutique editing facility Post Monsters as well as the lighting/grip rental company New England Light & Grip.\n\nGiancola has repeatedly demonstrated a perceptive gift for spotting new talent. Giancola cast the likes of [[Jesse Eisenberg|Jessie Eisenberg]], [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]], [[Kate Bosworth]], [[Paul Dano]], [[Josh Peck]], and even [[Billy Ray Cyrus]] in their first starring roles. He has also directed the likes of [[Bruce Campbell]], [[Stacy Keach]], [[Sean Astin]], [[Morgan Fairchild]], [[James Coburn]], and [[Tim Blake Nelson]] among others.

The band took their name from a cargo vessel that Massey sighted in a port on Lake Michigan.\n\n==History==\n\n===1998\u20132004===\nInitially the band concentrated on playing their own versions of classic blues songs, particularly electric Chicago-style blues, and performed their first concert at Phyllis' Musical Inn in Chicago on October 29, 1998. The band quickly progressed from covering blues tunes to writing their own music. In 1999 the band met singer-songwriter Michael Connelly, who collaborated with them on their inaugural effort, the five-song EP ''Goin' Back Home''. The Steepwater Band returned the favor by performing on Connelly's project, ''Bottles of Wine''. Connelly officially joined The Steepwater Band in 2000.\n\nThe years of 1999 and 2000 saw the band performing frequently in Chicago and the surrounding region. On June 8, 2000, The Steepwater Band performed at their first [[Chicago Blues Festival]], kicking off that year's event at noon.\n\nThe band released its first full-length album, ''Brother to the Snake,'' in 2001 with the support of radio station [[WXRT]] and [[Jim Beam]] to a packed house at Chicago's [[Double Door]]. During the year the band also released a live-in-the-studio album, ''Live...Half in the Bag''.\n\nThe band continued to play in the Midwest in 2002 and 2003, often as an opening act. The band also signed a recording, management, and publishing deal with Funzalo Records/Mike's Artist Management during this period. This relationship resulted in the production of one album, ''Dharmakaya,'' which was recorded with producers Sean Slade and Paul Kolderie ([[Radiohead]], [[Warren Zevon]], [[the Pixies]], [[Uncle Tupelo]]) in Boston and released on May 18, 2004. Connelly departed in October 2004, and the band and Funzalo/MAM ended their relationship in early 2005.\n\n===2005\u2013present===\n[[Image:The Steepwater Band Azkena 2005.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The Steepwater Band performing at the Azkena Rock Festival, September 1, 2005.]]\nIn April 2005 the band performed on television in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Tennessee, with [[Little Milton]], who died a few months later. In June, for their fifth time playing the [[Chicago Blues Festival]], they received a headlining slot on the Best Buy Showcase Stage. In September they performed their first European concert at the [[Azkena Rock Festival]] in Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. In addition to their own 70-minute set, they hosted a late-night jam session with members of the [[Drive-by Truckers]] and the Basque band The Soulbreaker Company. In November 2005, the band was invited by Chicago rock radio station [[WCKL (FM)|WLUP]] to open for [[Bon Jovi]] at the sold-out United Center.<ref name=\"NWITIMES\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.nwitimes.com/lifestyles/steepwater-band-to-open-tonight-for-bon-jovi/article_246e43e9-e35d-5de3-becf-75bd2aa33906.html |title=Steepwater band to open tonight for Bon Jovi |accessdate=December 15, 2019 |date=November 5, 2005 |work=NWI Times}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006 the band performed at various festivals and concerts with [[Umphrey's McGee]], [[Yonder Mountain String Band]], [[Keller Williams]], the [[Doobie Brothers]], [[Ian Gillan]] ([[Deep Purple]]'s vocalist), and [[Cheap Trick]]. The band's third full-length album, ''Revelation Sunday'', was released on August 15, 2006 with a release concert held on August 11, 2006, at Chicago's Metro music venue. In September, the band headlined three concerts, with The Soulbreaker Company as the opening act, in Madrid, Bilbao, and Barcelona, Spain. [[Rick Richards]], guitarist of [[The Georgia Satellites]], joined the band on stage for three songs in Barcelona.\n\nIn January 2007, the band performed on the ''Gimme Three Days'' cruise with [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[38 Special (band)|38 Special]], American Minor, Tishamingo, [[Blackberry Smoke]], and other [[blues-rock]], [[Southern rock]] and country artists aboard the [[Carnival Cruise Lines]] ''Fascination''. In its March issue, ''[[Vintage Guitar]]'' magazine published a full-page article/interview with band members. In July, the band returned to Europe for a tour of Spain and the Canary Islands. The tour began with a concert in Barcelona, Spain, on July 5 with Gov't Mule and John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers, and also included a date with long-time Black Crowes guitarist Marc Ford. In conjunction with the tour the band also released ''Songs From the Eighth Day'', featuring covers of Neil Young's \"Cortez the Killer\", Bob Dylan's \"Phantom Engineer\", Big Bill Broonzy's \"Key to the Highway\", Robert Johnson's \"Walkin' Blues\", a live version of \"Collision\", and two new Steepwater Band songs.\n\nIn May 2008, the band recorded ''Grace and Melody'' at the Compound Studios in Long Beach, CA with producer Marc Ford. It was released on Diamond Day Records in November 2008 in the US and December 2008 in Europe.\n\nIn December 2009, the band announced a five-week tour of Europe, including a run with Marc Ford in Spain on the first ten dates. In early February 2010, the band embarked on a two-week tour with Gov't Mule, and shortly after began another five-week European tour. In September 2010, \"The Stars Look Good Tonight\", debuted on the FMQB AAA Top 200 Radio Chart at No.&nbsp;165. In October 2010 Diamond Day Records released ''Live at the Double Door'', recorded at a single show in May 2010.

The band took their name from a cargo vessel that Massey sighted in a port on Lake Michigan.\n\n==History==\n\n===1998\u20132004===\nInitially the band concentrated on playing their own versions of classic blues songs, particularly electric Chicago-style blues, and performed their first concert at Phyllis' Musical Inn in Chicago on October 29, 1998. The band quickly progressed from covering blues tunes to writing their own music. In 1999 the band met singer-songwriter Michael Connelly, who collaborated with them on their inaugural effort, the five-song EP ''Goin' Back Home''. The Steepwater Band returned the favor by performing on Connelly's project, ''Bottles of Wine''. Connelly officially joined The Steepwater Band in 2000.\n\nThe years of 1999 and 2000 saw the band performing frequently in Chicago and the surrounding region. On June 8, 2000, The Steepwater Band performed at their first [[Chicago Blues Festival]], kicking off that year's event at noon.\n\nThe band released its first full-length album, ''Brother to the Snake,'' in 2001 with the support of radio station [[WXRT]] and [[Jim Beam]] to a packed house at Chicago's [[Double Door]]. During the year the band also released a live-in-the-studio album, ''Live...Half in the Bag''.\n\nThe band continued to play in the Midwest in 2002 and 2003, often as an opening act. The band also signed a recording, management, and publishing deal with Funzalo Records/Mike's Artist Management during this period. This relationship resulted in the production of one album, ''Dharmakaya,'' which was recorded with producers Sean Slade and Paul Kolderie ([[Radiohead]], [[Warren Zevon]], [[the Pixies]], [[Uncle Tupelo]]) in Boston and released on May 18, 2004. Connelly departed in October 2004, and the band and Funzalo/MAM ended their relationship in early 2005.\n\n===2005\u2013present===\n[[Image:The Steepwater Band Azkena 2005.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The Steepwater Band performing at the Azkena Rock Festival, September 1, 2005.]]\nIn April 2005 the band performed on television in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Tennessee, with [[Little Milton]], who died a few months later. In June, for their fifth time playing the [[Chicago Blues Festival]], they received a headlining slot on the Best Buy Showcase Stage. In September they performed their first European concert at the [[Azkena Rock Festival]] in Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. In addition to their own 70-minute set, they hosted a late-night jam session with members of the [[Drive-by Truckers]] and the Basque band The Soulbreaker Company. In November 2005, the band was invited by Chicago rock radio station [[WCKL (FM)|WLUP]] to open for [[Bon Jovi]] at the sold-out United Center.<ref name=\"NWITIMES\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.nwitimes.com/lifestyles/steepwater-band-to-open-tonight-for-bon-jovi/article_246e43e9-e35d-5de3-becf-75bd2aa33906.html |title=Steepwater band to open tonight for Bon Jovi |accessdate=December 15, 2019 |date=November 5, 2005 |work=NWI Times}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006 the band performed at various festivals and concerts with [[Umphrey's McGee]], [[Yonder Mountain String Band]], [[Keller Williams]], the [[Doobie Brothers]], [[Ian Gillan]] ([[Deep Purple]]'s vocalist), and [[Cheap Trick]]. The band's third full-length album, ''Revelation Sunday'', was released on August 15, 2006 with a release concert held on August 11, 2006, at Chicago's Metro music venue. In September, the band headlined three concerts, with The Soulbreaker Company as the opening act, in Madrid, Bilbao, and Barcelona, Spain. [[Rick Richards]], guitarist of [[The Georgia Satellites]], joined the band on stage for three songs in Barcelona.\n\nIn January 2007, the band performed on the ''Gimme Three Days'' cruise with [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[38 Special (band)|38 Special]], American Minor, Tishamingo, [[Blackberry Smoke]], and other [[blues-rock]], [[Southern rock]] and country artists aboard the [[Carnival Cruise Lines]] ''Fascination''. In its March issue, ''[[Vintage Guitar]]'' magazine published a full-page article/interview with band members. In July, the band returned to Europe for a tour of Spain and the Canary Islands. The tour began with a concert in Barcelona, Spain, on July 5 with Gov't Mule and John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers, and also included a date with long-time Black Crowes guitarist Marc Ford. In conjunction with the tour the band also released ''Songs From the Eighth Day'', featuring covers of Neil Young's \"Cortez the Killer\", Bob Dylan's \"Phantom Engineer\", Big Bill Broonzy's \"Key to the Highway\", Robert Johnson's \"Walkin' Blues\", a live version of \"Collision\", and two new Steepwater Band songs.\n\nIn May 2008, the band recorded ''Grace and Melody'' at the Compound Studios in Long Beach, CA with producer Marc Ford. It was released on Diamond Day Records in November 2008 in the US and December 2008 in Europe.\n\nIn December 2009, the band announced a five-week tour of Europe, including a run with Marc Ford in Spain on the first ten dates. In early February 2010, the band embarked on a two-week tour with Gov't Mule, and shortly after began another five-week European tour. In September 2010, \"The Stars Look Good Tonight\", debuted on the FMQB AAA Top 200 Radio Chart at No.&nbsp;165. In October 2010 Diamond Day Records released ''Live at the Double Door'', recorded at a single show in May 2010. ''Clava'' was released August 16, 2011\n\nIn 2012, \"Collision\", off 2006's ''Revelation Sunday'', appeared in the motion picture, ''[[One for the Money (film)|One for the Money]]''.

At present, this identification is considered incorrect, since there is no archaeological material of the XIII century on the site of Shengeldy.\nOn the territory of the ili valley, the route of the medieval silk road passed through small towns that were located on the site of modern Kastek, Kaskelen and Almaty and reached the city of Talkhiz (Talgar).

Excavations at the site were conducted in the 1960s under the direction of [[Kimal Akishev|K. A. Akishev]]. The area of the settlement was determined, the structure of city fortifications was studied, a complex of material culture of the IX\u2013X centuries was identified \u2013 ceramic dishes, items of local handicraft production, and imported products were also found.
