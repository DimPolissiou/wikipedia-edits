Its practitioners develop theories that explain such dynamical processes as the rise and fall of empires, population booms and busts, spread and disappearance of religions.{{sfn|Sussan|2013}}{{sfn|Schrodt|2005}} These theories are translated into mathematical models. Finally, model predictions are tested against data. Thus, building and analyzing massive databases of historical and archaeological information is one of the most important goals of cliodynamics.{{sfn|Spinney|2012}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''cliodynamics'' is composed of ''clio-'' and ''-dynamics''. In Greek mythology, [[Clio]] is the [[muse]] of history. [[Dynamics (mechanics)|Dynamics]], most broadly, is the study of how and why phenomena change with time.{{sfn|Parry|2013}}\n\n==Origins==\nThe term was originally coined by [[Peter Turchin]] in 2003,{{sfn|Orf|2013}} and can be traced to the work of such figures as [[Ibn Khaldun]]{{sfn|Tainter|2004|p=488}} [[Alexandre Deulofeu]], [[Jack Goldstone]], [[Sergey Kapitsa]], [[Randall Collins]], [[John Komlos]], and [[Andrey Korotayev]].\n\n==Mathematical modeling of historical dynamics==\n\n[[File:Http mikebert.neocities.org Amer-sec-cycles.gif|thumb|Cliodynamics attempts to analyze historical trends from sociological data.]]\nMany historical processes are dynamic (a dynamic process is one that changes with time). [[Population]]s increase and decline, economies expand and contract, states grow and collapse. A very common approach, which has proved its worth in innumerable applications (particularly, but not exclusively, in the [[natural sciences]]), consists of taking a holistic phenomenon and splitting it up into separate parts that are assumed to interact with each other. This is the [[dynamical systems|dynamical systems approach]], because the whole phenomenon is represented as a [[system]] consisting of several elements (or [[subsystem]]s) that interact and change dynamically; that is, over time. In the dynamical systems approach, one sets out explicitly with mathematical formulae how different subsystems interact with each other. This mathematical description is the model of the system, and one can use a variety of methods to study the [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] predicted by the model, as well as attempt to test the model by comparing its predictions with observed [[Empirical evidence|empirical]], dynamic evidence. Cliodynamics is the application of this same approach to the [[social sciences]] in general and to the study of historical dynamics in particular.\n\nCliodynamics practitioners apply [[mathematical model]]s to explain [[macrohistory|macrohistorical]] patterns \u2013 things like the rise of [[empire]]s, social discontent, [[civil war]]s, and [[Failed state|state collapse]].{{sfn|Spinney|2012}}{{sfn|Seabright|2004|p=806-7}}{{sfn|Keen|Owen|2017}} Although the focus is usually on the dynamics of large conglomerates of people, the approach of cliodynamics does not preclude the inclusion of human agency in its explanatory theories. Such questions can be explored with agent-based computer simulations.\n\n==Databases and data sources==\nCliodynamics relies on large bodies of evidence to test competing theories on a wide range of historical processes. This typically involves building massive stores of evidence.{{sfn|Spinney|2016}} The rise of [[digital history]] and various research technologies have allowed huge databases to be constructed in recent years. Some prominent databases utilized by cliodynamics practitioners include the following:\n* The [[Seshat (project)|Seshat: Global History Databank]], which systematically collects state-of-the-art accounts of the political and social organization of human groups and how societies have evolved through time into an authoritative databank.{{sfn|Turchin|Brennan|Currie|Feeney|2015}} Seshat is affiliated also with the [[Evolution Institute]], a non-profit think-tank that \"uses evolutionary science to solve real-world problems\".\n* D-PLACE: the Database of Places, Languages, Culture and Environment, which provides data on over 1,400 human social formations{{sfn|Kirby|Gray|Greenhill|Jordan|2016}}\n* The Atlas of Cultural Evolution, an archaeological database created by [[Peter N.

A similar analysis was performed on social media, again revealing strongly periodic structures.{{sfn|Dzogang|Lansdall-Welfare|Cristianini|2016}}\n\nThere are several established venues of peer reviewed cliodynamics research: \n* ''[[Cliodynamics_(journal)|Cliodynamics: The Journal of Quantitative History and Cultural Evolution]]''<ref>[http://escholarship.org/uc/irows_cliodynamics ''Cliodynamics: The Journal of Quantitative History and Cultural Evolution'']</ref> is a peer-reviewed web-based (open-access) journal that publishes on the transdisciplinary area of cliodynamics. It seeks to integrate historical models with data to facilitate theoretical progress. The first issue was published in December 2010. Cliodynamics is a member of [[Scopus]] and the [[Directory of Open Access Journals]] (DOAJ).\n* The [[University of Hertfordshire]]'s Cliodynamics Lab<ref>[http://www.herts.ac.uk/digital-history/cliodynamics-lab ''The University of Hertfordshire's Cliodynamics Lab'']</ref> is the first lab in the world dedicated explicitly to the new research area of cliodynamics. It is directed by Pieter Fran\u00e7ois, who founded the Lab in 2015.\n* The [[Santa Fe Institute]]<ref>[http://www.santafe.edu/ Santa Fe Institute]</ref> is a private, not-for-profit research and education center where leading scientists grapple with compelling and complex problems. The institute supports work in complex modeling of networks and dynamical systems. One of the areas of SFI research is cliodynamics.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.santafe.edu/news-center/news/cliodynamics-special-issue |title=History as Science:Journal for theoretical & mathematical history features 5 papers by SFI authors |website=www.santafe.edu}}</ref> In the past the institute has sponsored a series of conversations and meetings on theoretical history.<ref>For example, {{cite journal |url=http://escholarship.org/uc/search?entity=irows_cliodynamics;volume=2;issue=1 |title=An Inquiry into History, Big History, and Metahistory |website=www.santafe.edu}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nCritics of the cliodynamic approach often argue that the complex social formations of the past cannot and should not be reduced to quantifiable, analyzable 'data points', for doing so overlooks each historical society's peculiar circumstances and dynamics.{{sfn|Zhao|2006|p=309\u2013310}}{{sfn|Lange|2012}}{{sfn|Tainter|2004|p=488\u2013489}} Many historians and social scientists contend that there are no generalizable causal factors that can explain large numbers of cases, but that historical investigation should focus on the unique trajectories of each case, highlighting commonalities in outcomes where they exist. As Zhao notes, \"most historians believe that the importance of any mechanisms in history changes, and more important, there is no time-invariant structure that can organize all the historical mechanisms into a system\".{{sfn|Zhao|2006|p=309\u2013310}}{{sfn|Lange|2012}} Cliodynamicists, on the other hand, contend that there are large-scale, macrohistorical patterns that can explain the historical dynamics of the majority of known cases, and that these patterns can be uncovered through systematic, mathematical analysis. They argue that the ability of cliodynamics research to expose these patterns and to explain historical events demonstrates the feasibility of the approach.{{sfn|Turchin|2008}}\n\n==Fiction==\n[[Isaac Asimov]] employed a fictional version of this discipline, what he called [[Psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]], as a major [[plot device]] in his [[Foundation series|Foundation]] series of science fiction novels.<ref>Finley, Klint. 2013. [https://www.wired.com/2013/04/cliodynamics-peter-turchin/ \"Mathematicians Predict The Future With Data from the Past.\"] ''Wired''.</ref> Psychohistory differs from cliodynamics in its attempt to connect individuals directly to societal dynamics. In contrast, cliodynamics analyses societies as groups of individuals nested within ever-larger groups, ultimately and indirectly comprising a society.{{sfn|Turchin|2015}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Generations (book)|''Generations'' (book)]]\n* [[Historical geographic information system]]\n* [[Sociocultural evolution]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* Burkhart, Richard H. 2016.

Its practitioners develop theories that explain such dynamical processes as the rise and fall of empires, population booms and busts, spread and disappearance of religions.{{sfn|Sussan|2013}}{{sfn|Schrodt|2005}} These theories are translated into mathematical models. Finally, model predictions are tested against data. Thus, building and analyzing massive databases of historical and archaeological information is one of the most important goals of cliodynamics.{{sfn|Spinney|2012}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''cliodynamics'' is composed of ''clio-'' and ''-dynamics''. In Greek mythology, [[Clio]] is the [[muse]] of history. [[Dynamics (mechanics)|Dynamics]], most broadly, is the study of how and why phenomena change with time.{{sfn|Parry|2013}}\n\n==Origins==\nThe term was originally coined by [[Peter Turchin]] in 2003,{{sfn|Orf|2013}} and can be traced to the work of such figures as [[Ibn Khaldun]]{{sfn|Tainter|2004|p=488}} [[Alexandre Deulofeu]], [[Jack Goldstone]], [[Sergey Kapitsa]], [[Randall Collins]], [[John Komlos]], and [[Andrey Korotayev]].\n\n==Mathematical modeling of historical dynamics==\n\n[[File:Http mikebert.neocities.org Amer-sec-cycles.gif|thumb|Cliodynamics attempts to analyze historical trends from sociological data.]]\nMany historical processes are dynamic (a dynamic process is one that changes with time). [[Population]]s increase and decline, economies expand and contract, states grow and collapse. A very common approach, which has proved its worth in innumerable applications (particularly, but not exclusively, in the [[natural sciences]]), consists of taking a holistic phenomenon and splitting it up into separate parts that are assumed to interact with each other. This is the [[dynamical systems|dynamical systems approach]], because the whole phenomenon is represented as a [[system]] consisting of several elements (or [[subsystem]]s) that interact and change dynamically; that is, over time. In the dynamical systems approach, one sets out explicitly with mathematical formulae how different subsystems interact with each other. This mathematical description is the model of the system, and one can use a variety of methods to study the [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] predicted by the model, as well as attempt to test the model by comparing its predictions with observed [[Empirical evidence|empirical]], dynamic evidence. Cliodynamics is the application of this same approach to the [[social sciences]] in general and to the study of historical dynamics in particular.\n\nCliodynamics practitioners apply [[mathematical model]]s to explain [[macrohistory|macrohistorical]] patterns \u2013 things like the rise of [[empire]]s, social discontent, [[civil war]]s, and [[Failed state|state collapse]].{{sfn|Spinney|2012}}{{sfn|Seabright|2004|p=806-7}}{{sfn|Keen|Owen|2017}} Although the focus is usually on the dynamics of large conglomerates of people, the approach of cliodynamics does not preclude the inclusion of human agency in its explanatory theories. Such questions can be explored with agent-based computer simulations.\n\n==Databases and data sources==\nCliodynamics relies on large bodies of evidence to test competing theories on a wide range of historical processes. This typically involves building massive stores of evidence.{{sfn|Spinney|2016}} The rise of [[digital history]] and various research technologies have allowed huge databases to be constructed in recent years. Some prominent databases utilized by cliodynamics practitioners include the following:\n* The [[Seshat (project)|Seshat: Global History Databank]], which systematically collects state-of-the-art accounts of the political and social organization of human groups and how societies have evolved through time into an authoritative databank.{{sfn|Turchin|Brennan|Currie|Feeney|2015}} Seshat is affiliated also with the [[Evolution Institute]], a non-profit think-tank that \"uses evolutionary science to solve real-world problems\".\n* D-PLACE: the Database of Places, Languages, Culture and Environment, which provides data on over 1,400 human social formations{{sfn|Kirby|Gray|Greenhill|Jordan|2016}}\n* The Atlas of Cultural Evolution, an archaeological database created by [[Peter N.

A similar analysis was performed on social media, again revealing strongly periodic structures.{{sfn|Dzogang|Lansdall-Welfare|Cristianini|2016}}\n\nThere are several established venues of peer reviewed cliodynamics research: \n* ''[[Cliodynamics_(journal)|Cliodynamics: The Journal of Quantitative History and Cultural Evolution]]''<ref>[http://escholarship.org/uc/irows_cliodynamics ''Cliodynamics: The Journal of Quantitative History and Cultural Evolution'']</ref> is a peer-reviewed web-based (open-access) journal that publishes on the transdisciplinary area of cliodynamics. It seeks to integrate historical models with data to facilitate theoretical progress. The first issue was published in December 2010. Cliodynamics is a member of [[Scopus]] and the [[Directory of Open Access Journals]] (DOAJ).\n* The [[University of Hertfordshire]]'s Cliodynamics Lab<ref>[http://www.herts.ac.uk/digital-history/cliodynamics-lab ''The University of Hertfordshire's Cliodynamics Lab'']</ref> is the first lab in the world dedicated explicitly to the new research area of cliodynamics. It is directed by Pieter Fran\u00e7ois, who founded the Lab in 2015.\n* The [[Santa Fe Institute]]<ref>[http://www.santafe.edu/ Santa Fe Institute]</ref> is a private, not-for-profit research and education center where leading scientists grapple with compelling and complex problems. The institute supports work in complex modeling of networks and dynamical systems. One of the areas of SFI research is cliodynamics.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.santafe.edu/news-center/news/cliodynamics-special-issue |title=History as Science:Journal for theoretical & mathematical history features 5 papers by SFI authors |website=www.santafe.edu}}</ref> In the past the institute has sponsored a series of conversations and meetings on theoretical history.<ref>For example, {{cite journal |url=http://escholarship.org/uc/search?entity=irows_cliodynamics;volume=2;issue=1 |title=An Inquiry into History, Big History, and Metahistory |website=www.santafe.edu}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nCritics of the cliodynamic approach often argue that the complex social formations of the past cannot and should not be reduced to quantifiable, analyzable 'data points', for doing so overlooks each historical society's peculiar circumstances and dynamics.{{sfn|Zhao|2006|p=309\u2013310}}{{sfn|Lange|2012}}{{sfn|Tainter|2004|p=488\u2013489}} Many historians and social scientists contend that there are no generalizable causal factors that can explain large numbers of cases, but that historical investigation should focus on the unique trajectories of each case, highlighting commonalities in outcomes where they exist. As Zhao notes, \"most historians believe that the importance of any mechanisms in history changes, and more important, there is no time-invariant structure that can organize all the historical mechanisms into a system\".{{sfn|Zhao|2006|p=309\u2013310}}{{sfn|Lange|2012}} Cliodynamicists, on the other hand, contend that there are large-scale, macrohistorical patterns that can explain the historical dynamics of the majority of known cases, and that these patterns can be uncovered through systematic, mathematical analysis. They argue that the ability of cliodynamics research to expose these patterns and to explain historical events demonstrates the feasibility of the approach.{{sfn|Turchin|2008}}\n\n==Fiction==\n[[Isaac Asimov]] employed a fictional version of this discipline, what he called [[Psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]], as a major [[plot device]] in his [[Foundation series|Foundation]] series of science fiction novels.<ref>Finley, Klint. 2013. [https://www.wired.com/2013/04/cliodynamics-peter-turchin/ \"Mathematicians Predict The Future With Data from the Past.\"] ''Wired''.</ref> Psychohistory differs from cliodynamics in its attempt to connect individuals directly to societal dynamics. In contrast, cliodynamics analyses societies as groups of individuals nested within ever-larger groups, ultimately and indirectly comprising a society.{{sfn|Turchin|2015}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Generations (book)|''Generations'' (book)]]\n* [[Historical geographic information system]]\n* [[Sociocultural evolution]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* Burkhart, Richard H. 2016.

''St. Leon'' is the tale of a French aristocrat, Count Reginald de St. Leon, who loses his wealth gambling and experiences guilt that drives him almost to madness. He accepts the secret of the elixir of life and of the power of multiplying wealth from a dying stranger, ultimately causing him to wander separated from humankind.\n\n==Plot==\n\nCount Reginald narrates the story of his life, beginning with the death of his father when he was an infant. He was brought up by his mother, \"a woman of rather a masculine understanding, and full of the prejudices of nobility and magnificence.\"<ref>William Godwin. St. Leon: A Tale of the Sixteenth Century, ed. William D. Brewer (Peterborough, Ontario: Broadview, 2006), 55.</ref> \n\nReginald has grand notions of aristocratic honour, and, inspired by his uncle, the Marquis de Villeroy, he joins the Italian war of 1521\u20136, hoping to achieve military renown in the battle of [[Pavia]]. Reginald is knighted by King [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], while fighting for the French against the Spanish Imperial army, but the King is captured and imprisoned by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. The King's exile changes the climate in France from one in which \"the activity of the field\" is exchanged \"for the indulgences of the table.\" <ref>Godwin, 75.</ref> \n\nOn his return home, Reginald, now twenty years old is forced by the death of his mother to take charge of his own affairs. He is quickly led astray by a life of spending too much, keeping mistresses, and gambling. He lives like this for two years and quickly depletes his fortune. He meets the beautiful and accomplished nineteen-year-old Marguerite Louise Isabeau de Damville, whose education has benefited from the society of [[Clement Marot]], [[Rabelais]], [[Erasmus]], and [[Scaliger]], and whose drawing has been encouraged by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Reginald courts Marguerite, who is the daughter of the Marquis de Damville, but Reginald's reputation as a gambler causes the Marquis to warn him that he should be careful not to ruin himself and his daughter. The Marquis allows them to marry, but by the time he is in his thirties, Reginald is living beyond his means and has returned to gambling. The Marquis does not live to see this development. \n\nMarguerite moves their family to Switzerland and pays off her husband's debts by selling their possessions. She tries to convince him that the simpler life of a peasant will make the whole family happier and more virtuous. However, while they are beginning their farming life, their crops and animals are unexpectedly destroyed in a fierce storm. Disturbed by the sight of a dead woman and child, Reginald realizes he is fortunate when he returns home to find his family is safe. He dismisses his former love of money and rank. Seeing the casualties of a fierce storm reveals to him that his new life as a subsistence farmer is more valuable than he imagined, but that it is a life subject to the precarious whims of fortune. This development gives Godwin scope to expatiate on the Swiss system of storing corn in public reserves in case of natural disasters. \n\nReginald applies for national relief and a disbursement from the public treasury to enable him to restock his farm. But relief is refused on the grounds that he is not Swiss. Government officials are sent to remove the family from the country altogether without giving them time to sell their cottage. A compassionate neighbour lends them money against the house and they leave for [[Lake Constance]]. The neighbour dies, and his estate passes to a relative, Monsieur Grimseld, who steals their house. Reginald risks imprisonment to return to Switzerland to reclaim his cottage as his family are beginning to starve. Grimseld is fined for fraud, and Reginald is given the money for his farm.\n\nVolume 2 begins in the year 1544. An old man arrives at the family's house at Lake Constance, claiming to be a Venetian called Francesco Zampieri, but his true identity remains a mystery. He is being pursued by the Inquisition. Zampieri reveals to Reginald the secret of immortality and the art of multiplying gold. Only one person is permitted to know these secrets at any one time. The secret of immortality is an [[elixir of life|elixir]] made from herbs that when consumed bring youth and vigour. It cures sickness, but cannot save anyone from injury. Reluctant to keep a secret from his wife, Reginald is forced to remain silent about the gift and Zampieri dies shortly afterwards. \n\n[[Francis I of France|Francis I]] returns to France from his imprisonment in Spain, finding the country in a great upheaval, with [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and [[Henry VIII]] in the process of invading northern France. Unwilling to return to his simple domestic life, Reginald plans to repurchase the estate that he lost, but in order to make it seem like he has regained his wealth gradually and not in suspicious circumstances, he moves to the city of [[Konstanz|Constance]] and pretends that Zampieri had given him 3,000 crowns. Constance is in the process of becoming Protestant. \n\nReginald is quickly seduced into spending a great deal of money and arouses the suspicion of his countryman, [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Gaspard de Coligny]]. Reginald's son, Charles, becomes aware of the shame that wealth with an inexplicable origin has brought and disowns his father and leaves. Marguerite is also suspicious and guesses that he has found the [[Philosopher's Stone]]. Reginald tells her not to reveal this and not to enquire further about it. She is ill, but as the elixir can only be drunk by an \"adept\", he cannot give it to her. \n\nThe suspicions about Reginald's wealth grow to such a height that the magistrate has him arrested and questioned. He is asked about the disappearance of the stranger and about his new wealth, but refuses to cooperate. Monsieur Monluc, a Frenchman, arrives, and Reginald appeals to him for help. Monluc investigates the case, interviews Marguerite. Reginald tells him the honorable name of St. Leon which removes the necessity for an explanation and he does not provide a reason. Monluc refuses to help him further. \n\nMarguerite advises Reginald to escape from the prison. He attempts to bribe a turnkey, Hector, but he refuses to help because he is loyal to the keeper and he reveals this to the keeper. The keeper asks for a bribe. Reginald hands over a large sum but is led to a dungeon instead and chained to a wall. Hector is imprisoned because he is the only person who knows about the bribe. The keeper asks for more money, and Reginald is forced to trust him, and this time he is released provided he takes Hector with him in order to make the latter appear to be an accomplice.\n\nIn volume 3, Reginald, his family, and Hector set out for Italy. One evening, while Hector and Reginald are taking an evening walk while the family are at an inn in the Alps, Reginald hears a man shrieking and is attacked by a large black dog. The dog takes him to a man who is wounded and dying. Reginald and Hector dress his wounds, and Hector runs back to the inn to get help. \n\nThe man's name is Andrea Filosanto. He had been taking his mother's dower to her and was robbed. He dies, and the dog grieves for him. Reginald takes the dog, Charon, into his family. A few months later, the dog finds the assailant, who is apprehended, confesses to being one of the robbers, is tried, convicted, and executed. \n\nReginald settles in [[Pisa]], and is protected by the Filosanto family and the family of the woman Andrea was about to marry, the Carracciuoli, who are powerful in the Pisan territory. Reginald spends some time practicing alchemy in a grotto, employing Hector as an assistant. Hector tells his girlfriend about the experiments, and Reginald quickly gains the reputation of being a sorcerer. His girlfriend's other lover, Agostino, is jealous and seeks revenge. \n\nReginald is shunned, and someone shoots at their house at night. The dog is killed, and Hector is attacked. The attack is motivated by the suspicions about magic and by Hector's being of African origin. Reginald addresses the mob in an attempt to vindicate himself, but they throw mud at him and accuse him of witchcraft. \n\nHe leaves to consult with the Marchese Filosanto, and the rest of the family leave for [[Lucca]], heading for Spain. They leave Hector in charge of their house in Pisa. When Reginald goes back to Pisa, he finds that the mob have burned his house down, that Hector has gone mad and has escaped his carers and has died defending the house. Hector was tortured by the mob, and it is clear that the crime is racially motivated. \n\nMarguerite has a miscarriage in Lucca. The family continue to Spain, and Marguerite dies in [[Barcelona]]. Distraught, the family continues to Madrid. Here, the daughters are looked after by Mariana, a former companion of their mother's. Reginald repurchases his family's French estate, and he gradually separates himself from his children, considering this to be a virtuous action. They are told to think and speak of him as if he were dead. The family still do not know the whereabouts of Charles. \n\nReginald moves to [[Madrid]] and spends time studying natural philosophy and ethics. He is followed by two men, who are eventually revealed to be informers for the Inquisition. He is arrested and imprisoned for sorcery. [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] returns to Spain after his marriage to [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]], and he oversees an [[auto da F\u00e9]] in Seville. Philip then travels to [[Valladolid]] for another [[auto da F\u00e9]], at which Reginald is to be burned alive. The elixir of life cannot protect him from this punishment. \n\nWhile processing to Valladolid from Madrid, a horse is frightened and kicks, and in the confusion, Reginald escapes and breaks into the house of a Jewish convert to Christianity, Mordecai. Just as he had appealed to the turnkey as a member of an oppressed minority, so Reginald appeals to Mordecai to help him escape the [[Inquisition]]. Mordecai helps him change his clothes and fetches the herbs needed for the elixir of immortality. Reginald, how has visibly aged such that he looks like a man of eighty. He drinks the elixir and becomes as young and healthy as he was on his wedding day. He leaves without Mordecai's knowledge. During his escape, Reginald accidentally witnesses the auto da f\u00e9 and is horrified.\n\nAt the beginning of volume 4, Reginald visits his daughters disguised as an Armenian merchant. He has now been away from them for twelve years. Louisa is 28, Marguerite is 24 {{Disputed inline|Talk page section|date=February 2020}}, and Julia died four years previously after her fianc\u00e9 had been imprisoned by his father for intending to marry her. Reginald pretends to have known their father and informs them of his own death. He hopes that the death certificate that he gives them will remove the dishonour from his family. \n\nReginald leaves for Hungary and takes a house in [[Buda]], intending to use his money to revitalize the economy after the devastation of a long war. He gives charity to poor people, becomes a corn-dealer and an architect, and takes a new name: \"the sieur de Chatillon\" (p.&nbsp;366). Problems occur, however, when demand for corn becomes too great and the people suspect him of manipulating the market for personal gain. \n\nReginald presents himself to the Turkish Pasha of Buda, Muzaffer Bey. But Bey blames him for causing civil unrest and investigates the unknown origins of Reginald's wealth. Reginald is forced to bribe him. He then meets Bethlem Gabor, a misanthropic arms dealer, and a native of [[Hungary]], whose wife and children have been murdered. Like Reginald, Bethlem spends a great deal of time wandering, and they share their sorrows and become friends. \n\nThe civil unrest eases as the crops that Reginald has ordered to be sown are ripening and are being successfully protected by soldiers. Three months have passed since Reginald first became acquainted with Bethlem. After expecting to meet him while travelling, Reginald is captured by Austro-Hungarian freebooters. He escapes and finds Bethlem, but without warning, Bethlem takes him to one of his castles and puts him in the dungeon. Reginald is left without food for thirty-six hours, and then he is given food and chained to a wall. \n\nBethlem gives as his reason for his hostility: that Reginald had helped an enemy of his, unknowingly, and that although he and Reginald had suffered the same loss of their families, Reginald had reacted to it by being kind to a great number of people and Bethlem had done the reverse. Bethlem feels shamed by this. Reginald tries to pay Bethlem to let him go, and requests a chest from his house. Bethlem opens the chest and discovers that it contains alchemical equipment. He demands gold, making it clear that he intends to keep Reginald locked up forever in order to supply it. \n\nIn the dungeon Reginald dreams that he is rescued by a knight in armour, who turns into a female angel, and that they fly away together leaving the castle in flames. Something close to this vision comes true. Bethlem visits Reginald's cell to tell him that the castle is under siege, and that he is experiencing remorse for keeping him captive. Bethlem gives Reginald the means to escape, making him promise not to do so for twenty-four hours. Reginald waits six hours, justifying his inability to keep his promise with the argument that it was extorted under duress. He spends two hours trying to get out of the caverns, but finds that the aids he left on the walls on his way in are no longer helpful. \n\nHe hears a loud shout and is startled, and concludes that he is near the outside. But a large amount of smoke convinces him to wait before he attempts to leave and he returns to the dungeons risking suffocation. He hides in a different cell from the one to which he was confined in case Bethlem returns. Eventually, Reginald leaves the castle in ruins and approaches some soldiers. He immediately recognizes his son Charles, who has changed his surname to de Damville. Charles is now thirty-two. Ruminating over what has happened, Reginald cannot account for Bethlem's hostile actions or his remorse and he forgives him. Charles does not recognize his father, who appears to be twenty-two, even though the other soldiers notice their similarity. \n\nIntending not to disgrace his son, Reginald adopts the name Henry d'Aubigny. Charles and Reginald quickly become friends, and Charles reveals his history. He is fighting the Turks, and prefers not to fight in the wars between Protestants and Catholics. He is also in search of Chatillon because of his known friendship with Bethlem Gabor. Reginald does not reveal that he is Chatillon. Charles recounts that he fought with General Castaldo in the [[battle of Muhlberg]] in 1547, whom he served for seven years. He recalls the siege of Erlau ([[Eger]], Hungary) and notes the bravery of the women of the city, and the siege of Ziget ([[Sisak]] in Croatia). Ziget was governed by Horvati, a Christian, and was besieged by the Turkish [[Pasha]] of Buda. \n\nThe Pasha lost the siege and died of grief and mortification. While Charles sympathizes a great deal with his son and is proud of his achievements, he regards his role as a Christian warrior as religious fanaticism. Charles has fallen in love with Pandora, the niece of the palatine of Hungary, Nadasti, whom he first met when she was fourteen. Pandora's father died in the siege of Ziget, leaving her a poor orphan and Nadasti prefers Charles to marry one of his own daughters. Charles realizes that he cannot support a wife on his pay, and he needs the uncle's consent. Reginald sees Pandora and is struck by her beauty, good sense and naturalness. He is determined to use his wealth to enable them to marry, but needs to find a way to make it seem appropriate. Reginald discovers that Pandora's mother had been a Venetian, and that her mother's uncle sailed with the Spanish explorer [[Francisco Pizarro]] to conquer [[Peru]]. Her uncle having died during the mission, he did not receive a portion of the treasure. Pandora being his sole surviving relative would have inherited this treasure. \n\nReginald finds, by chance, a man who had sailed on the same ship, Benedetto Cabriera, who has lost all of his money due to a series of calamities. Reginald pays him to pretend that Pandora's uncle had received his share, and that it had been bequeathed to her. While waiting for Benedetto to appear with the money in Hungary, Reginald learns that Charles has rejected Pandora because he thinks, incorrectly, that she is in love with Reginald and is an \u2018unfeeling coquette\u2019. Pandora explains to Reginald that they must no longer see each other, and is interrupted by Charles's arrival, faints and is caught by Reginald increasing Charles's suspicions. Charles remonstrates with them both and leaves them speechless. \n\nReginald yearns to tell his son the truth about his identity and learns his greatest lesson about solitude: more than a dungeon, solitude is alienation from your child. Reginald leaves for [[Presburg]] and meets Charles, who is on his way to accompany Mary, Queen of Scots back to her native land. Charles confronts his father with a letter from Andrew, Count of Bathori, accusing Reginald of being Chatillon and an alchemist. He tells Reginald that he lost his father to alchemy and challenges Reginald to a duel. Reginald agrees, but leaves Presburg before the appointed time. \n\nCharles and Pandora are reconciled, and the remainder of Reginald's story is devoted to tracing the development of Charles's virtues and to expressing his own regret at realizing the importance of his family too late.\n\n==Themes==\n\nThe novel explores the themes of immortality, the domestic affections (love and friendship), honour, and religion. Into a historical novel of vast range and violence Godwin melds elements of the domestic novel, the philosophical novel, and fantasy. More so than the earlier ''[[Things as They Are; or, The Adventures of Caleb Williams|Caleb Williams]]'', this novel tests Godwin's philosophical premises, showing the tensions between the aspiration to greatness and family affections and the disintegration of effective social responsibility.\n\n===Money===\n\nThe novel deals with a range of issues connected with wealth. Firstly, it moralizes against gambling, viewing it as a waste of resources and a drain on the time of people who could be doing something more useful with their wealth. Secondly, it traces the effects of poverty, suggesting that there is a nobility in the simple life. While the peasant life is favoured, the novel emphasizes that education is also important, and so the aristocratic family who are living in reduced circumstances have the benefit of having developed their minds and of living in a way that does not oppress anyone. Thirdly, the novel reflects on the power of wealth. The ideas expressed in the novel follow those of Godwin's ''[[Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Modern Morals and Manners]]'' (1793). Reginald reflects that \"[w]eakness and want are the parents of vice\".<ref>Godwin, 187.</ref> When Reginald is finally in a position to put his new ability to multiply gold to good use, he secures the future of his daughters, and then travels to Buda to help stimulate the post-war economy with a building program. When he finds his son Charles, he is able to give his intended wife a dowry without them knowing it. Wherever Reginald goes, he confronts problems with appearing to have excessive wealth that comes from no discernible origin. Here Godwin addresses the topic of the surveillance society, the problem of secrecy, and the traditional motif of cursed gold.\n\n===Liberty and intolerance===\n\nThe novel asks the questions: what do we need in order to be truly free? And what is oppression? Reginald's lost money may appear to him to be a disaster, but his wife, Marguerite, philosophizes that its loss makes them less able to oppress people by engaging them as servants, and it makes them more free themselves. She argues that people who are educated and live the life of a peasant are the happiest because they do not reduce the people below them \u201cto a state of servitude\u201d and in turn become themselves enslaved to their own homes and lifestyle.<ref>Godwin, 124.</ref> Intolerance is further explored through the persecutions of the Inquisition. Both the stranger who gives Reginald the secrets and Reginald himself are pursued by the Inquisition for sorcery. At several points in the narrative, Godwin expatiates on the power and unthinking qualities of mob-like behavior. He also explores racial intolerance through the torture and murder of Hector, the African servant, and the fear expressed by Mordechai, the Spanish convert from Judaism to Christianity. Reginald appeals to both for help on the grounds that they have experienced the same kind of oppression as him. Godwin also devotes a great deal of time to exploring the difficulties of immigrants and refugees. The St. Leon family is displaced several times, and they learn that the \"prepossessions of mankind are clearly unfavourable to a newcomer, an emigrant who has quitted his former connections and the scenes of his youth. They are unavoidably impelled to believe, that his taking up his abode in another country must be owing to a weak and discreditable caprice, if it be not owing to something still more disadvantageous in his character.\"<ref>Godwin, 133.</ref>\n\n===Honour and merit===\n\nHonour and merit are central themes in ''[[Things as They Are; or, The Adventures of Caleb Williams|Caleb Williams]]''. Again, Godwin pits aristocratic reputation against intrinsic merit. Like Falkland, in ''Caleb Williams'', Reginald has been brought up to think of himself as worthy of admiration and homage. He learns that the \"value of a man is in his intrinsic qualities\" and that honour is not inherited, it must be earned and displayed in one's actions.<ref>Godwin, 130.</ref> While Godwin associates aristocratic honour with vanity and ostentation, there remains in the novel a sense in which honourable behaviour is valued insofar as it signals loyalty, equitable action, and acting in an open manner.\n\n===Gender===\n\nTo some extent the novel preserves traditional ideas about the differences between men and women. Women are commended for their beauty and men for their bravery. Marguerite, however, is presented as an exceptional woman in that she is unusually brave, rational, and independent. Marguerite suggests that as a wife she should be \"a human being and an equal\" and that this means that they should be open with each other. In accordance with Godwin's views in Political Justice, Reginald attacks what he regards as effeminacy in men, and in particular, men who are inactive or who are emotional or cowardly. Zampieri, the stranger, criticizes Reginald for arguing that he could not keep a secret from his wife, calling him \"[f]eeble and effeminate\" and \"the puppet of a woman\".<ref>Godwin, 157.</ref> Reginald agrees to keep the secret, but still holds that his wife and he are two halves of one soul and rightly fears that the secret will lead to an emotional separation.\n\n==Influence==\n\n''St. Leon'' influenced the Gothic novel ''[[St. Irvyne; or, The Rosicrucian]]'' (1811) by Godwin's future son-in-law [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818), which was dedicated to Godwin, and written by his daughter [[Mary Shelley]].<ref>Mary Shelley.

Brewer (Peterborough, Ontario: Broadview, 2006), 55.</ref> \n\nReginald has grand notions of aristocratic honour, and, inspired by his uncle, the Marquis de Villeroy, he joins the Italian war of 1521\u20136, hoping to achieve military renown in the battle of [[Pavia]]. Reginald is knighted by King [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], while fighting for the French against the Spanish Imperial army, but the King is captured and imprisoned by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. The King's exile changes the climate in France from one in which \"the activity of the field\" is exchanged \"for the indulgences of the table.\" <ref>Godwin, 75.</ref> \n\nOn his return home, Reginald, now twenty years old is forced by the death of his mother to take charge of his own affairs. He is quickly led astray by a life of spending too much, keeping mistresses, and gambling. He lives like this for two years and quickly depletes his fortune. He meets the beautiful and accomplished nineteen-year-old Marguerite Louise Isabeau de Damville, whose education has benefited from the society of [[Clement Marot]], [[Rabelais]], [[Erasmus]], and [[Scaliger]], and whose drawing has been encouraged by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Reginald courts Marguerite, who is the daughter of the Marquis de Damville, but Reginald's reputation as a gambler causes the Marquis to warn him that he should be careful not to ruin himself and his daughter. The Marquis allows them to marry, but by the time he is in his thirties, Reginald is living beyond his means and has returned to gambling. The Marquis does not live to see this development. \n\nMarguerite moves their family to Switzerland and pays off her husband's debts by selling their possessions. She tries to convince him that the simpler life of a peasant will make the whole family happier and more virtuous. However, while they are beginning their farming life, their crops and animals are unexpectedly destroyed in a fierce storm. Disturbed by the sight of a dead woman and child, Reginald realizes he is fortunate when he returns home to find his family is safe. He dismisses his former love of money and rank. Seeing the casualties of a fierce storm reveals to him that his new life as a subsistence farmer is more valuable than he imagined, but that it is a life subject to the precarious whims of fortune. This development gives Godwin scope to expatiate on the Swiss system of storing corn in public reserves in case of natural disasters. \n\nReginald applies for national relief and a disbursement from the public treasury to enable him to restock his farm. But relief is refused on the grounds that he is not Swiss. Government officials are sent to remove the family from the country altogether without giving them time to sell their cottage. A compassionate neighbour lends them money against the house and they leave for [[Lake Constance]]. The neighbour dies, and his estate passes to a relative, Monsieur Grimseld, who steals their house. Reginald risks imprisonment to return to Switzerland to reclaim his cottage as his family are beginning to starve. Grimseld is fined for fraud, and Reginald is given the money for his farm.\n\nVolume 2 begins in the year 1544. An old man arrives at the family's house at Lake Constance, claiming to be a Venetian called Francesco Zampieri, but his true identity remains a mystery. He is being pursued by the Inquisition. Zampieri reveals to Reginald the secret of immortality and the art of multiplying gold. Only one person is permitted to know these secrets at any one time. The secret of immortality is an [[elixir of life|elixir]] made from herbs that when consumed bring youth and vigour. It cures sickness, but cannot save anyone from injury. Reluctant to keep a secret from his wife, Reginald is forced to remain silent about the gift and Zampieri dies shortly afterwards. \n\n[[Francis I of France|Francis I]] returns to France from his imprisonment in Spain, finding the country in a great upheaval, with [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and [[Henry VIII]] in the process of invading northern France. Unwilling to return to his simple domestic life, Reginald plans to repurchase the estate that he lost, but in order to make it seem like he has regained his wealth gradually and not in suspicious circumstances, he moves to the city of [[Konstanz|Constance]] and pretends that Zampieri had given him 3,000 crowns. Constance is in the process of becoming Protestant. \n\nReginald is quickly seduced into spending a great deal of money and arouses the suspicion of his countryman, [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Gaspard de Coligny]]. Reginald's son, Charles, becomes aware of the shame that wealth with an inexplicable origin has brought and disowns his father and leaves. Marguerite is also suspicious and guesses that he has found the [[Philosopher's Stone]]. Reginald tells her not to reveal this and not to enquire further about it. She is ill, but as the elixir can only be drunk by an \"adept\", he cannot give it to her. \n\nThe suspicions about Reginald's wealth grow to such a height that the magistrate has him arrested and questioned. He is asked about the disappearance of the stranger and about his new wealth, but refuses to cooperate. Monsieur Monluc, a Frenchman, arrives, and Reginald appeals to him for help. Monluc investigates the case, interviews Marguerite. Reginald tells him the honorable name of St. Leon which removes the necessity for an explanation and he does not provide a reason. Monluc refuses to help him further. \n\nMarguerite advises Reginald to escape from the prison. He attempts to bribe a turnkey, Hector, but he refuses to help because he is loyal to the keeper and he reveals this to the keeper. The keeper asks for a bribe. Reginald hands over a large sum but is led to a dungeon instead and chained to a wall. Hector is imprisoned because he is the only person who knows about the bribe. The keeper asks for more money, and Reginald is forced to trust him, and this time he is released provided he takes Hector with him in order to make the latter appear to be an accomplice.\n\nIn volume 3, Reginald, his family, and Hector set out for Italy. One evening, while Hector and Reginald are taking an evening walk while the family are at an inn in the Alps, Reginald hears a man shrieking and is attacked by a large black dog. The dog takes him to a man who is wounded and dying. Reginald and Hector dress his wounds, and Hector runs back to the inn to get help. \n\nThe man's name is Andrea Filosanto. He had been taking his mother's dower to her and was robbed. He dies, and the dog grieves for him. Reginald takes the dog, Charon, into his family. A few months later, the dog finds the assailant, who is apprehended, confesses to being one of the robbers, is tried, convicted, and executed. \n\nReginald settles in [[Pisa]], and is protected by the Filosanto family and the family of the woman Andrea was about to marry, the Carracciuoli, who are powerful in the Pisan territory. Reginald spends some time practicing alchemy in a grotto, employing Hector as an assistant. Hector tells his girlfriend about the experiments, and Reginald quickly gains the reputation of being a sorcerer. His girlfriend's other lover, Agostino, is jealous and seeks revenge. \n\nReginald is shunned, and someone shoots at their house at night. The dog is killed, and Hector is attacked. The attack is motivated by the suspicions about magic and by Hector's being of African origin. Reginald addresses the mob in an attempt to vindicate himself, but they throw mud at him and accuse him of witchcraft. \n\nHe leaves to consult with the Marchese Filosanto, and the rest of the family leave for [[Lucca]], heading for Spain. They leave Hector in charge of their house in Pisa. When Reginald goes back to Pisa, he finds that the mob have burned his house down, that Hector has gone mad and has escaped his carers and has died defending the house. Hector was tortured by the mob, and it is clear that the crime is racially motivated. \n\nMarguerite has a miscarriage in Lucca. The family continue to Spain, and Marguerite dies in [[Barcelona]]. Distraught, the family continues to Madrid. Here, the daughters are looked after by Mariana, a former companion of their mother's. Reginald repurchases his family's French estate, and he gradually separates himself from his children, considering this to be a virtuous action. They are told to think and speak of him as if he were dead. The family still do not know the whereabouts of Charles. \n\nReginald moves to [[Madrid]] and spends time studying natural philosophy and ethics. He is followed by two men, who are eventually revealed to be informers for the Inquisition. He is arrested and imprisoned for sorcery. [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] returns to Spain after his marriage to [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]], and he oversees an [[auto da F\u00e9]] in Seville. Philip then travels to [[Valladolid]] for another [[auto da F\u00e9]], at which Reginald is to be burned alive. The elixir of life cannot protect him from this punishment. \n\nWhile processing to Valladolid from Madrid, a horse is frightened and kicks, and in the confusion, Reginald escapes and breaks into the house of a Jewish convert to Christianity, Mordecai. Just as he had appealed to the turnkey as a member of an oppressed minority, so Reginald appeals to Mordecai to help him escape the [[Inquisition]]. Mordecai helps him change his clothes and fetches the herbs needed for the elixir of immortality. Reginald, how has visibly aged such that he looks like a man of eighty. He drinks the elixir and becomes as young and healthy as he was on his wedding day. He leaves without Mordecai's knowledge. During his escape, Reginald accidentally witnesses the auto da f\u00e9 and is horrified.\n\nAt the beginning of volume 4, Reginald visits his daughters disguised as an Armenian merchant. He has now been away from them for twelve years. Louisa is 28, Marguerite is 24 {{Disputed inline|Talk page section|date=February 2020}}, and Julia died four years previously after her fianc\u00e9 had been imprisoned by his father for intending to marry her. Reginald pretends to have known their father and informs them of his own death. He hopes that the death certificate that he gives them will remove the dishonour from his family. \n\nReginald leaves for Hungary and takes a house in [[Buda]], intending to use his money to revitalize the economy after the devastation of a long war. He gives charity to poor people, becomes a corn-dealer and an architect, and takes a new name: \"the sieur de Chatillon\" (p.&nbsp;366). Problems occur, however, when demand for corn becomes too great and the people suspect him of manipulating the market for personal gain. \n\nReginald presents himself to the Turkish Pasha of Buda, Muzaffer Bey. But Bey blames him for causing civil unrest and investigates the unknown origins of Reginald's wealth. Reginald is forced to bribe him. He then meets Bethlem Gabor, a misanthropic arms dealer, and a native of [[Hungary]], whose wife and children have been murdered. Like Reginald, Bethlem spends a great deal of time wandering, and they share their sorrows and become friends. \n\nThe civil unrest eases as the crops that Reginald has ordered to be sown are ripening and are being successfully protected by soldiers. Three months have passed since Reginald first became acquainted with Bethlem. After expecting to meet him while travelling, Reginald is captured by Austro-Hungarian freebooters. He escapes and finds Bethlem, but without warning, Bethlem takes him to one of his castles and puts him in the dungeon. Reginald is left without food for thirty-six hours, and then he is given food and chained to a wall. \n\nBethlem gives as his reason for his hostility: that Reginald had helped an enemy of his, unknowingly, and that although he and Reginald had suffered the same loss of their families, Reginald had reacted to it by being kind to a great number of people and Bethlem had done the reverse. Bethlem feels shamed by this. Reginald tries to pay Bethlem to let him go, and requests a chest from his house. Bethlem opens the chest and discovers that it contains alchemical equipment. He demands gold, making it clear that he intends to keep Reginald locked up forever in order to supply it. \n\nIn the dungeon Reginald dreams that he is rescued by a knight in armour, who turns into a female angel, and that they fly away together leaving the castle in flames. Something close to this vision comes true. Bethlem visits Reginald's cell to tell him that the castle is under siege, and that he is experiencing remorse for keeping him captive. Bethlem gives Reginald the means to escape, making him promise not to do so for twenty-four hours. Reginald waits six hours, justifying his inability to keep his promise with the argument that it was extorted under duress. He spends two hours trying to get out of the caverns, but finds that the aids he left on the walls on his way in are no longer helpful. \n\nHe hears a loud shout and is startled, and concludes that he is near the outside. But a large amount of smoke convinces him to wait before he attempts to leave and he returns to the dungeons risking suffocation. He hides in a different cell from the one to which he was confined in case Bethlem returns. Eventually, Reginald leaves the castle in ruins and approaches some soldiers. He immediately recognizes his son Charles, who has changed his surname to de Damville. Charles is now thirty-two. Ruminating over what has happened, Reginald cannot account for Bethlem's hostile actions or his remorse and he forgives him. Charles does not recognize his father, who appears to be twenty-two, even though the other soldiers notice their similarity. \n\nIntending not to disgrace his son, Reginald adopts the name Henry d'Aubigny. Charles and Reginald quickly become friends, and Charles reveals his history. He is fighting the Turks, and prefers not to fight in the wars between Protestants and Catholics. He is also in search of Chatillon because of his known friendship with Bethlem Gabor. Reginald does not reveal that he is Chatillon. Charles recounts that he fought with General Castaldo in the [[battle of Muhlberg]] in 1547, whom he served for seven years. He recalls the siege of Erlau ([[Eger]], Hungary) and notes the bravery of the women of the city, and the siege of Ziget ([[Sisak]] in Croatia). Ziget was governed by Horvati, a Christian, and was besieged by the Turkish [[Pasha]] of Buda. \n\nThe Pasha lost the siege and died of grief and mortification. While Charles sympathizes a great deal with his son and is proud of his achievements, he regards his role as a Christian warrior as religious fanaticism. Charles has fallen in love with Pandora, the niece of the palatine of Hungary, Nadasti, whom he first met when she was fourteen. Pandora's father died in the siege of Ziget, leaving her a poor orphan and Nadasti prefers Charles to marry one of his own daughters. Charles realizes that he cannot support a wife on his pay, and he needs the uncle's consent. Reginald sees Pandora and is struck by her beauty, good sense and naturalness. He is determined to use his wealth to enable them to marry, but needs to find a way to make it seem appropriate. Reginald discovers that Pandora's mother had been a Venetian, and that her mother's uncle sailed with the Spanish explorer [[Francisco Pizarro]] to conquer [[Peru]]. Her uncle having died during the mission, he did not receive a portion of the treasure. Pandora being his sole surviving relative would have inherited this treasure. \n\nReginald finds, by chance, a man who had sailed on the same ship, Benedetto Cabriera, who has lost all of his money due to a series of calamities. Reginald pays him to pretend that Pandora's uncle had received his share, and that it had been bequeathed to her. While waiting for Benedetto to appear with the money in Hungary, Reginald learns that Charles has rejected Pandora because he thinks, incorrectly, that she is in love with Reginald and is an \u2018unfeeling coquette\u2019. Pandora explains to Reginald that they must no longer see each other, and is interrupted by Charles's arrival, faints and is caught by Reginald increasing Charles's suspicions. Charles remonstrates with them both and leaves them speechless. \n\nReginald yearns to tell his son the truth about his identity and learns his greatest lesson about solitude: more than a dungeon, solitude is alienation from your child. Reginald leaves for [[Presburg]] and meets Charles, who is on his way to accompany Mary, Queen of Scots back to her native land. Charles confronts his father with a letter from Andrew, Count of Bathori, accusing Reginald of being Chatillon and an alchemist. He tells Reginald that he lost his father to alchemy and challenges Reginald to a duel. Reginald agrees, but leaves Presburg before the appointed time. \n\nCharles and Pandora are reconciled, and the remainder of Reginald's story is devoted to tracing the development of Charles's virtues and to expressing his own regret at realizing the importance of his family too late.\n\n==Themes==\n\nThe novel explores the themes of immortality, the domestic affections (love and friendship), honour, and religion. Into a historical novel of vast range and violence Godwin melds elements of the domestic novel, the philosophical novel, and fantasy. More so than the earlier ''[[Things as They Are; or, The Adventures of Caleb Williams|Caleb Williams]]'', this novel tests Godwin's philosophical premises, showing the tensions between the aspiration to greatness and family affections and the disintegration of effective social responsibility.\n\n===Money===\n\nThe novel deals with a range of issues connected with wealth. Firstly, it moralizes against gambling, viewing it as a waste of resources and a drain on the time of people who could be doing something more useful with their wealth. Secondly, it traces the effects of poverty, suggesting that there is a nobility in the simple life. While the peasant life is favoured, the novel emphasizes that education is also important, and so the aristocratic family who are living in reduced circumstances have the benefit of having developed their minds and of living in a way that does not oppress anyone. Thirdly, the novel reflects on the power of wealth. The ideas expressed in the novel follow those of Godwin's ''[[Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Modern Morals and Manners]]'' (1793). Reginald reflects that \"[w]eakness and want are the parents of vice\".<ref>Godwin, 187.</ref> When Reginald is finally in a position to put his new ability to multiply gold to good use, he secures the future of his daughters, and then travels to Buda to help stimulate the post-war economy with a building program. When he finds his son Charles, he is able to give his intended wife a dowry without them knowing it. Wherever Reginald goes, he confronts problems with appearing to have excessive wealth that comes from no discernible origin. Here Godwin addresses the topic of the surveillance society, the problem of secrecy, and the traditional motif of cursed gold.\n\n===Liberty and intolerance===\n\nThe novel asks the questions: what do we need in order to be truly free? And what is oppression? Reginald's lost money may appear to him to be a disaster, but his wife, Marguerite, philosophizes that its loss makes them less able to oppress people by engaging them as servants, and it makes them more free themselves. She argues that people who are educated and live the life of a peasant are the happiest because they do not reduce the people below them \u201cto a state of servitude\u201d and in turn become themselves enslaved to their own homes and lifestyle.<ref>Godwin, 124.</ref> Intolerance is further explored through the persecutions of the Inquisition. Both the stranger who gives Reginald the secrets and Reginald himself are pursued by the Inquisition for sorcery. At several points in the narrative, Godwin expatiates on the power and unthinking qualities of mob-like behavior. He also explores racial intolerance through the torture and murder of Hector, the African servant, and the fear expressed by Mordechai, the Spanish convert from Judaism to Christianity. Reginald appeals to both for help on the grounds that they have experienced the same kind of oppression as him. Godwin also devotes a great deal of time to exploring the difficulties of immigrants and refugees. The St. Leon family is displaced several times, and they learn that the \"prepossessions of mankind are clearly unfavourable to a newcomer, an emigrant who has quitted his former connections and the scenes of his youth. They are unavoidably impelled to believe, that his taking up his abode in another country must be owing to a weak and discreditable caprice, if it be not owing to something still more disadvantageous in his character.\"<ref>Godwin, 133.</ref>\n\n===Honour and merit===\n\nHonour and merit are central themes in ''[[Things as They Are; or, The Adventures of Caleb Williams|Caleb Williams]]''. Again, Godwin pits aristocratic reputation against intrinsic merit. Like Falkland, in ''Caleb Williams'', Reginald has been brought up to think of himself as worthy of admiration and homage. He learns that the \"value of a man is in his intrinsic qualities\" and that honour is not inherited, it must be earned and displayed in one's actions.<ref>Godwin, 130.</ref> While Godwin associates aristocratic honour with vanity and ostentation, there remains in the novel a sense in which honourable behaviour is valued insofar as it signals loyalty, equitable action, and acting in an open manner.\n\n===Gender===\n\nTo some extent the novel preserves traditional ideas about the differences between men and women. Women are commended for their beauty and men for their bravery. Marguerite, however, is presented as an exceptional woman in that she is unusually brave, rational, and independent. Marguerite suggests that as a wife she should be \"a human being and an equal\" and that this means that they should be open with each other. In accordance with Godwin's views in Political Justice, Reginald attacks what he regards as effeminacy in men, and in particular, men who are inactive or who are emotional or cowardly. Zampieri, the stranger, criticizes Reginald for arguing that he could not keep a secret from his wife, calling him \"[f]eeble and effeminate\" and \"the puppet of a woman\".<ref>Godwin, 157.</ref> Reginald agrees to keep the secret, but still holds that his wife and he are two halves of one soul and rightly fears that the secret will lead to an emotional separation.\n\n==Influence==\n\n''St. Leon'' influenced the Gothic novel ''[[St. Irvyne; or, The Rosicrucian]]'' (1811) by Godwin's future son-in-law [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818), which was dedicated to Godwin, and written by his daughter [[Mary Shelley]].<ref>Mary Shelley.

The rift between Muhsin Yaz\u0131c\u0131o\u011flu and [[Alparslan T\u00fcrke\u015f]] actually started after the [[1980 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat]]. Alparslan T\u00fcrke\u015f defended himself in the infamous speech in which he declared \"My opinions and beliefs are of the same as the generals who organized the 1980 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat, yet I am in prison\" speech during trials after the coup. The ideological separation started then and reached the surface after Alparslan T\u00fcrke\u015f dismissed the Ankara headquarters of the MHP after the 1992 MHP Congress. The delegates had elected the candidate supported by [[Muhsin Yaz\u0131c\u0131o\u011flu]] rather than the candidate of Alparslan T\u00fcrke\u015f environment. T\u00fcrke\u015f's dismissal, seen to show an anti-democratic approach, was the final blow to the relationship between the young clique who had suffered during the 1980 coup and were against anything anti-democratic, and the old clique which circled around Alparslan T\u00fcrke\u015f and believed in a nationalist-socialistic way of democracy.\n\nThe party has been represented in the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Parliament]] only via electoral coalitions with popular parties. At the 2002 [[legislative]] [[elections in Turkey|elections]], the party won 1.1% of the popular vote and no seats; in the [[2007 Turkish general election|2007 elections]] Muhsin Yaz\u0131c\u0131o\u011flu was elected as an independent.

The rift between Muhsin Yaz\u0131c\u0131o\u011flu and [[Alparslan T\u00fcrke\u015f]] actually started after the [[1980 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat]]. Alparslan T\u00fcrke\u015f defended himself in the infamous speech in which he declared \"My opinions and beliefs are of the same as the generals who organized the 1980 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat, yet I am in prison\" speech during trials after the coup. The ideological separation started then and reached the surface after Alparslan T\u00fcrke\u015f dismissed the Ankara headquarters of the MHP after the 1992 MHP Congress. The delegates had elected the candidate supported by [[Muhsin Yaz\u0131c\u0131o\u011flu]] rather than the candidate of Alparslan T\u00fcrke\u015f environment. T\u00fcrke\u015f's dismissal, seen to show an anti-democratic approach, was the final blow to the relationship between the young clique who had suffered during the 1980 coup and were against anything anti-democratic, and the old clique which circled around Alparslan T\u00fcrke\u015f and believed in a nationalist-socialistic way of democracy.\n\nThe party has been represented in the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Parliament]] only via electoral coalitions with popular parties. At the 2002 [[legislative]] [[elections in Turkey|elections]], the party won 1.1% of the popular vote and no seats; in the [[2007 Turkish general election|2007 elections]] Muhsin Yaz\u0131c\u0131o\u011flu was elected as an independent.

Bassist [[Nikolai Fraiture]] befriended Casablancas while the two attended the [[Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais de New York]]. At age 13, Casablancas was sent to [[Institut Le Rosey|Le Rosey]], a boarding school in [[Switzerland]], to improve his academic performance. There, he met guitarist [[Albert Hammond, Jr.]] Later, when Hammond came to New York to attend [[New York University]]'s [[Tisch School of the Arts]], he shared an apartment with Casablancas. The roommates started a band, first performing at HiFi Bar, then The Spiral, followed by the [[Luna Lounge]] on the [[Lower East Side]] of New York, and then at Manhattan's popular [[Mercury Lounge]]. The Mercury Lounge's booker, [[Ryan Gentles]], quit his job to become the band's manager.<ref>Bush, B. (August 2002). The strokes.

Most of these songs now feature different [[lyrics]]. The band sent a demo to the newly reformed [[Rough Trade Records]] in the UK, sparking interest there, and leading to their first release (via the website of the UK magazine, ''[[NME]],'' who gave away a free mp3 download of \"[[Last Nite]]\" a week prior to the physical release as part of ''[[The Modern Age]]'' [[Extended play|EP]] in 2001).

Despite its delayed release (and the potential controversy), ''Is This It'' received critical acclaim\u2014among other accolades, four stars from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', and a 9.1 from [[Pitchfork Media]]. The album made many critics' top-ten lists, was named the best album of the year by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', and (in an article previewing summer concerts) ''[[NME]]'' urged readers to attend the Strokes\u2019 shows\u2014as they were touring some of the \"best pop songs ever\". While critics noted the influence of [[CBGB]] stalwarts [[Television (band)|Television]], Casablancas and bandmates said they had never heard the band, instead citing [[the Velvet Underground]] as a reference point.\n\nAfter the release of ''Is This It'', the band toured around the world\u2014including [[Japan]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Europe]], and [[North America]] (the band opened for the [[Rolling Stones]] on numerous occasions during the North American leg of their tour). The self-made mini-documentary \"In Transit\" was filmed during the summer tour of Europe. In August 2002, the band headlined the UK's [[Carling Weekend]] festivals for the second time, subsequently playing at New York's [[Radio City Music Hall]] on a bill with [[the White Stripes]]. [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]] joined the Strokes on stage to perform the guitar solo on \"New York City Cops\".

The first single taken from ''Room on Fire'' was the song \"[[12:51 (The Strokes song)|12:51]]\", which used distinct keyboard-like sounds produced by Valensi's guitar.

In Japan, it went gold within the first week of release. It was also the most downloaded album for two weeks on iTunes. Fraiture claimed that the album was \"like a scientific breakthrough\". In January 2006, the band then made their second appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' playing \"Juicebox\" and \"[[You Only Live Once (The Strokes song)|You Only Live Once]]\". The album was somewhat a departure from the band's two previous albums. One reason for this was a switch of producers from Gordon Raphael to David Kahne.<ref>Marchese, D. (January 2006).

In February 2006, the Strokes won \"Best International Band\" at the NME Awards. In March, the band returned to the US with their longest tour yet. The second single off ''First Impressions of Earth'', \"Heart in a Cage\", was released in March 2006. During the summer of 2006, the Strokes played several festival dates in Europe, including the Hultsfred Festival in Sweden, [[Roskilde Festival]] in Denmark, the [[Oxegen Festival]] in Ireland, the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in Switzerland, the FIB ([[Festival Internacional de Benic\u00e0ssim]]), [[Fuji Rock Festival]] and headlined the [[Pentaport Rock Festival]] in South Korea. They then toured Australia and Mexico in late August and early September, followed by the second leg of the United States tour. While in the US, the Strokes opened for [[Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers]] for five shows during their Highway Companion tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2006/07/tom-petty-adds-sept-dates-strokes-frank-black/ |title=Tom Petty Adds Sept.

During this final tour Casablancas stated to fans that the band would be taking an extensive break after it finished. An e-mail was sent out soon afterwards by Strokes manager [[Ryan Gentles]], confirming that \"much needed break\". A new band website went online in May 2007 along with the release of an alternate video to their single \"You Only Live Once\" directed by [[Warren Fu]]. The video also featured a brief interlude with \"Ize of the World\", also from ''First Impressions of Earth''. The song \"You Talk Way Too Much\" was used in a commercial for the Ford Sync.

At age 13, Casablancas was sent to [[Institut Le Rosey|Le Rosey]], a boarding school in [[Switzerland]], to improve his academic performance. There, he met guitarist [[Albert Hammond, Jr.]] Later, when Hammond came to New York to attend [[New York University]]'s [[Tisch School of the Arts]], he shared an apartment with Casablancas. The roommates started a band, first performing at HiFi Bar, then The Spiral, followed by the [[Luna Lounge]] on the [[Lower East Side]] of New York, and then at Manhattan's popular [[Mercury Lounge]]. The Mercury Lounge's booker, [[Ryan Gentles]], quit his job to become the band's manager.<ref>Bush, B. (August 2002). The strokes.

Most of these songs now feature different [[lyrics]]. The band sent a demo to the newly reformed [[Rough Trade Records]] in the UK, sparking interest there, and leading to their first release (via the website of the UK magazine, ''[[NME]],'' who gave away a free mp3 download of \"[[Last Nite]]\" a week prior to the physical release as part of ''[[The Modern Age]]'' [[Extended play|EP]] in 2001).

Despite its delayed release (and the potential controversy), ''Is This It'' received critical acclaim\u2014among other accolades, four stars from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', and a 9.1 from [[Pitchfork Media]]. The album made many critics' top-ten lists, was named the best album of the year by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', and (in an article previewing summer concerts) ''[[NME]]'' urged readers to attend the Strokes\u2019 shows\u2014as they were touring some of the \"best pop songs ever\".

The self-made mini-documentary \"In Transit\" was filmed during the summer tour of Europe. In August 2002, the band headlined the UK's [[Carling Weekend]] festivals for the second time, subsequently playing at New York's [[Radio City Music Hall]] on a bill with [[the White Stripes]].

They also made the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' for the first time. Additional media coverage of the band came from the relationship between Moretti and actress [[Drew Barrymore]], which ended in January 2007. The first single taken from ''Room on Fire'' was the song \"[[12:51 (The Strokes song)|12:51]]\", which used distinct keyboard-like sounds produced by Valensi's guitar. The video was also directed by Roman Coppola, and was inspired by the futuristic look of the 1980s film ''[[Tron]]''. This consisted of a mainly black scene, with instances of glowing picton blue and riptide.\n\nIn November 2003, the Strokes played on ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien'', performing \"[[Reptilia (song)|Reptilia]]\", \"What Ever Happened\", \"Under Control\" and \"I Can't Win\".<ref>DeRogatis, J.

While on tour, Spektor and the Strokes recorded the song \"[[Modern Girls & Old Fashion Men]]\", released as a B-side on the \"Reptilia\" single. Also during the tour, the band included [[the Clash]]'s \"Clampdown\" as a cover, which was released as the B-side for \"[[The End Has No End]]\".\n\nIn late 2004, the Strokes revealed plans to release a live album. The ''Live in London'' LP was planned for release in October 2004, but was abandoned, reportedly due to recording quality problems. The chosen gig was one held at the legendary [[Alexandra Palace]] in North London.\n\n=== ''First Impressions of Earth'' and hiatus (2005\u20132007) ===\n[[File:The Strokes in concert.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The Strokes in concert, 2006]]\nIn late September 2005, \"[[Juicebox (song)|Juicebox]]\", the first single from the Strokes' then unreleased third album, was leaked online, forcing the single's release date to be advanced. The single was then released as an exclusive on online download services. \"Juicebox\" became the Strokes' second UK Top 10 hit, as well as their second US Modern Rock Top 10 success. During November and December 2005 the Strokes did a promotional tour for the still unreleased album, which involved doing one-off shows in major cities around the world. Their third album, ''[[First Impressions of Earth]]'', was released on December 30, 2005, in Germany<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.laut.de/The-Strokes/Alben/First-Impressions-Of-Earth-11120 |title=\"First Impressions of Earth\" von The Strokes |last=Butscher |first=Vicky |website=[[Laut.de]] |language=German |access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref> and January 3, 2006, elsewhere.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/first-impressions-of-earth-mw0000339306 |title=First Impressions of Earth - The Strokes |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref> It received mixed reviews and debuted at number four in the US and number one in the UK, the latter being a first for the band. In Japan, it went gold within the first week of release. It was also the most downloaded album for two weeks on iTunes. Fraiture claimed that the album was \"like a scientific breakthrough\". In January 2006, the band then made their second appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' playing \"Juicebox\" and \"[[You Only Live Once (The Strokes song)|You Only Live Once]]\". The album was somewhat a departure from the band's two previous albums. One reason for this was a switch of producers from Gordon Raphael to David Kahne.<ref>Marchese, D. (January 2006).

In February 2006, the Strokes won \"Best International Band\" at the NME Awards. In March, the band returned to the US with their longest tour yet. The second single off ''First Impressions of Earth'', \"Heart in a Cage\", was released in March 2006. During the summer of 2006, the Strokes played several festival dates in Europe, including the Hultsfred Festival in Sweden, [[Roskilde Festival]] in Denmark, the [[Oxegen Festival]] in Ireland, the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in Switzerland, the FIB ([[Festival Internacional de Benic\u00e0ssim]]), [[Fuji Rock Festival]] and headlined the [[Pentaport Rock Festival]] in South Korea. They then toured Australia and Mexico in late August and early September, followed by the second leg of the United States tour. While in the US, the Strokes opened for [[Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers]] for five shows during their Highway Companion tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2006/07/tom-petty-adds-sept-dates-strokes-frank-black/ |title=Tom Petty Adds Sept.

During this final tour Casablancas stated to fans that the band would be taking an extensive break after it finished. An e-mail was sent out soon afterwards by Strokes manager [[Ryan Gentles]], confirming that \"much needed break\". A new band website went online in May 2007 along with the release of an alternate video to their single \"You Only Live Once\" directed by [[Warren Fu]]. The video also featured a brief interlude with \"Ize of the World\", also from ''First Impressions of Earth''. The song \"You Talk Way Too Much\" was used in a commercial for the Ford Sync.

After several years of planning, the city council approved the Eastside Loop extension in 2008 and the project's groundbreaking took place in 2009. The {{convert|3.3|mi|km|adj=on}} extension opened between the Broadway Bridge and OMSI on September 22, 2012. It was inaugurated with the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line''') service, which ran an additional {{convert|1.1|mi|km}} alongside the NS Line on 10th and 11th avenues. This service split into two and re-branded in 2015 during the opening of Tilikum Crossing, which completed the streetcar loop with a southerly river crossing extension from OMSI to the South Waterfront.\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Broadway Bridge west end.jpg|thumb|left|The Broadway Bridge in 2009, prior to the installation of streetcar tracks]]\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

Streetcar]] system. Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|5.7|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] on the west side. After several years of planning, the city council approved the Eastside Loop extension in 2008 and the project's groundbreaking took place in 2009. The {{convert|3.3|mi|km|adj=on}} extension opened between the Broadway Bridge and OMSI on September 22, 2012. It was inaugurated with service from '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line'''), which ran an additional {{convert|1.1|mi|km}} along the NS Line on 10th and 11th avenues. This service split into two and re-branded in 2015 during the opening of Tilikum Crossing, which completed the streetcar loop with a southerly river crossing extension from OMSI to the South Waterfront.\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Broadway Bridge west end.jpg|thumb|left|The Broadway Bridge in 2009, prior to the installation of streetcar tracks]]\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

The city formally was incorporated in 1736. The city was burned by orders of the outgoing [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[Colony of Virginia]] [[Governor of Virginia|colonial governor]] in 1776 during the second year of the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u20131783), although it was soon rebuilt.\n\nThe 19th century proved to be a time of numerous travails for both the city of Norfolk, and the region as whole. War, epidemics, fires, and economic depression reduced the development of the city. The city grew into the region's economic hub. By the late 19th century, the [[Norfolk and Western Railway]] with its line to the west established the community as a major [[coal]] ore exporting port and built a large trans-loading facility at [[Lambert's Point]]. It became the terminus for numerous other  railroads, linking its ports to inland regions of Virginia and North Carolina, and at the turn of the 20th century, the coal mining regions of [[Appalachia]] were well connected to the port on the [[East coast of the United States|East Coast]]. [[Princess Anne County, Virginia|Princess Anne]] and [[Norfolk County, Virginia|Norfolk]] counties would become leaders in truck farming, producing over half of all greens and potatoes consumed on the East Coast. [[Lynnhaven, Virginia|Lynnhaven]] oysters also became a major export.\n\nThe region's [[African Americans]] achieved full emancipation following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] (1861\u20131865), after the initial [[Emancipation Proclamation]] by 16th President  [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1862\u20131863, supplemented later by the three post-war [[United States Constitution|constitutional amendments]] during the [[Reconstruction era]] (1865\u20131877), only to be faced with severe discrimination through white legislators' later imposition by the 1890s of [[Jim Crow Laws]]. After Virginia passed a new post-war state constitution, African Americans were essentially disfranchised for more than 60 years until their leadership and activism won passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s.\nIn 1907, it was host to the Jamestown Exposition commemorating the tercennary (300th anniversary) of the first [[Kingdom of England|English]] settlement at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] on the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]], the only world's fair to ever be held in Virginia. As a result of its publicity and visits by high-ranking officials during the exposition (in which the [[Great White Fleet]], of 26th President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] with the rebuilt [[United States Navy]] after the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] of 1898 was launched from [[Hampton Roads]] harbor), it became the later location of the [[Norfolk Naval Station]].\n\nToday, the city of Norfolk is a major American naval and world shipping hub, as well as the center of the [[Hampton Roads]] region, both on the [[Southside Virginia|southside]]  and the [[Virginia peninsula|peninsula]] to the north of the extensive harbor between the [[James River (Virginia)|James]] and [[York River (Virginia)|York Rivers]], with the railroad terminus and ship construction  port of [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]] from the 19th century on the west shore and [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]] on the south and east sides, dating back to its founding in the colonial era as Virginia's original port.\n\n==Pre-colonial==\nThe first evidence of humans inhabiting Virginia is from 9,500 BC.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nIn 1584, Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] led an expedition in search of a suitable place to establish a permanent English settlement in North America. By mid-July of that year, two of his ships had landed on [[Roanoke Island]] (now a part of [[Dare County]]). [[Arthur Barlowe]], one of Raleigh's commanders, kept a journal which states the area was inhabited by a tribe of [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]] called the [[Chesepian]]. According to Barlowe, the local Chesepians claimed that a nearby city called Skicoak was the Chesepians' greatest city. However, the exact location of ''Skicoak'' has remained undetermined.\n\nWhen [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] settlers arrived at [[Cape Henry]] (in present-day Virginia Beach) almost 23 years later in April 1607, they found no traces of ''Skicoak''. According to [[William Strachey]]'s ''The Historie of Travaile into Virginia Britanica'' (1612), the Chesepians had been wiped out by Chief [[Wahunsunacock]] (better known as [[Chief Powhatan]]), the head of the [[Virginia Peninsula]]-based [[Powhatan Confederacy]] in the intervening years.\n\n==Colonial period (1607\u20131775)==\n{{Tall image|Mace of Norfolk, Virginia in 1909.jpg|100|box height|alt=alt text|Mace of Norfolk, Virginia presented in 1754|right}}\nIn 1607, the Governor for the Virginia Colony, [[George Yeardley|Sir George Yeardley]] established four incorporations, termed \"citties\" {{sic}} for the developed portion of the colony. These citties were to form the basis for the government of the colony in the newly created [[House of Burgesses]], with the southeastern portion of the Hampton Roads region falling under the [[Elizabeth City (Virginia Company)|Elizabeth Cittie]] {{sic}} incorporation. In 1622, [[Adam Thoroughgood]] (1604\u20131640) of [[King's Lynn]], [[Norfolk]], England, became one of the earliest Englishmen to settle in the area that was to become [[South Hampton Roads]], when at the age of 18 he became an [[indentured servant]] to pay for passage to the Virginia Colony. After his period of contracted servitude was finished, he earned his freedom and soon became a leading citizen of the fledgling colony.\n\nMeanwhile, after years of continuing struggles at Jamestown, the now bankrupt [[Virginia Company]] had its royal charter revoked by [[James I of England|King James I]] in 1624 and Virginia became a crown colony. Also at this time, the King granted {{convert|500|acre|km2}} of land to Thomas Willoughby, in what is now the [[Ocean View, Virginia|Ocean View]] section of the city. The entire population of the Virginia colony was estimated to be 5,000 people at this time.\n\nIn 1629, Thoroughgood was elected to the House of Burgesses for Elizabeth Cittie.  Five years later, in 1634, the King had the colony reorganized under a system of 8 [[shires of Virginia|shires]], with much of the Hampton Roads region becoming part of [[Elizabeth City Shire]]. In 1636, Thoroughgood was granted a large land holding along the Lynnhaven River for having persuaded 105 people to settle in the colony. Thoroughgood is also credited with suggesting the name of Norfolk, in honor of his birthplace. [[New Norfolk County]] was created when the South Hampton Roads portion of Elizabeth City Shire was partitioned off in that same year. Also during this reorganization, King James granted a further {{convert|200|acre|km2}} to Willoughby. This land would become the city of Norfolk in future. Shortly thereafter, in 1637, New Norfolk County was itself split into two counties, [[Upper Norfolk County]] and [[Lower Norfolk County]]. The modern city of Norfolk is located in Lower Norfolk.\n\nIn 1649 the English couple William and Susannah Moseley migrated with their family to Lower Norfolk County. On the [[Eastern Branch Elizabeth River]] {{convert|5|mi|km}} from Norfolk, they built a manor house with Dutch-style [[gambrel roof]] which later became  known as Rolleston Hall. Rolleston Hall stood more than 200 years, until it burned down in the late 19th century.<ref name=\"rolleston.org.uk\">[http://www.rolleston.org.uk/hall/virginia.htm] Rolleston Hall</ref><ref name=\"rolleston.org.uk\" /><ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B0DE6D8123EEE34BC4950DFB166838E679FDE] The Wise and Terry Letters: Gov.

This marked the beginning of Norfolk's importance as a [[port]] city, due to its natural deepwater channels. Soon after 1673, the \"Half Moone\" fort at the site of what is now [[Town Pointe Park]]. This fort was constructed due to feared attack by the Dutch, but this threat did not materialize. Norfolk quickly grew in size, and by 1682 a charter for the establishment of the \"Towne of Lower Norfolk County\" had been issued by Parliament. Norfolk was one of only three cities in the Virginia Colony to receive a royal charter, the other two being [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] and [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]]. The town initially encompassed a land area northeast of the point of the confluence of the Eastern and [[Southern Branch Elizabeth River|Southern]] Branches of the [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]] (today the point is in downtown). In 1691, a final county subdivision took place when Lower Norfolk County was split to form [[Norfolk County, Virginia|Norfolk County]] (present day Norfolk, Chesapeake, and parts of Portsmouth) and [[Princess Anne County]] (present day Virginia Beach). Norfolk was incorporated in 1705 and re-chartered as a borough in 1736.<ref name=\"Norfolk History Chapter 6\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/highlights/06.html\n| title = The \"Half Moone\" Fort\n| accessdate = 2008-02-19\n| publisher = Norfolk Historical Society\n| language = \n}}</ref><ref name=\"Norfolk History Chapter 7\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/highlights/07.html\n| title = The Birth of \"Norfolk Towne\"\n| accessdate = 2008-02-19\n| publisher = Norfolk Historical Society\n| language = \n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1753, Lt. Governor [[Robert Dinwiddie]] presented the growing city of 4,000 with a {{convert|41|in|mm|adj=on}} long, 104 ounce silver [[ceremonial mace|mace]]. The mace was a symbol of royal authority and is currently displayed in the [[Chrysler Museum of Art]].\n\nBy 1775, Norfolk had developed into one of the most prosperous cities in Virginia. It was a major [[shipbuilding]] center and an important trans-shipment point for the export of goods such as [[tobacco]], [[maize|corn]], [[cotton]], and [[timber]] from Virginia and North Carolina, to the British Isles and beyond. In turn, goods from the [[West Indies]] such as [[rum]] and [[sugar]], and finished manufactured products from England, were imported back through Norfolk and shipped to the rest of the lower colonies. Much of the West Indies and American colonial products that flowed through the harbor were by this time produced with the use of [[slavery|slave]] labor.\n\n==Revolutionary War (1775\u20131783)==\n[[File:Cannonball lodged in church wall.jpg|thumb|Cannonball in the wall of [[Saint Paul's Episcopal Church (Norfolk, Virginia)|Saint Paul's Episcopal Church]]]]\nNorfolk had been a strong base of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] support throughout the start of the American Revolution. In the early summer of 1775, [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]], the last Royal Governor of the Colony of Virginia, tried to reestablish control of the colony from Norfolk. In November, a battle took place at [[Battle of Kemp's Landing|Kemp's Landing]] which provided Dunmore and the loyalists a clear victory, but it was nonetheless clear by then that the war was escalating. The governor immediately issued [[Dunmore's Proclamation]], which promised freedom to any rebel-owned slave who joined His Majesty's forces. At the end of November, Dunmore set up a stronghold in Norfolk,<ref>[http://research.history.org/DigitalLibrary/VirginiaGazette/VGImagePopup.cfm?ID=4640&Res=HI Virginia Gazette (Dixon & Hunter)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818153354/http://research.history.org/DigitalLibrary/VirginiaGazette/VGImagePopup.cfm?ID=4640&Res=HI |date=2007-08-18 }} (2 Dec 1775, page 3) via research.history.org- accessed 2008-01-03</ref> demolishing some 30 houses in the course of its construction.

British troops also went ashore to burn down all the waterfront buildings, and thus played right into the hands of their enemies.

At the turn of the 19th century, [[Fort Norfolk (Norfolk, Virginia)|Fort Norfolk]] was constructed by the Federal government to guard the harbor.\n\nDuring the 1820s the agricultural communities of South Hampton Roads experienced a prolonged recession, resulting in the emigration of families from the region to other areas of the South, especially the frontier areas being opened for settlement. From 1820 to 1830, there was a drop in overall population of about 15,000 in [[Norfolk County, Virginia|Norfolk County]], despite the fact that other urban areas experienced significant population growth.\n\nLike other Southern states, Virginia struggled with slavery, especially as it became less important in the mixed agricultural economy that was replacing that of tobacco. Virginia considered ideas to either phase out slavery through law (see [[Thomas Jefferson Randolph]]'s 1832 resolution) or to \"repatriate\" blacks by sending them to Africa to establish a colony at Liberia. The [[American Colonization Society]] (ACS), established in 1816, was the largest of groups founded for that purpose. Many emigrants from Virginia and North Carolina embarked for Africa from Norfolk. One such emigrant was [[Joseph Jenkins Roberts]], a native of Norfolk who would go on to become the first president of [[Liberia]]. Active emigration through the ACS came to an end following the Civil War.\n\nBy 1840, Norfolk's population was 10,920 for the borough proper (not including the rest of the county). With the concentration of population came more interest in education and culture. In 1841 an ambitious new school building was completed for Norfolk Academy, designed by Thomas U. Walter as a replica of the temple of Theseus in Athens. In 1845, Norfolk was incorporated as a city. By 1850 the city's population was approximately 14,000 persons, including 4,000 enslaved African Americans and 1,000 free blacks.\n\nTransportation improvements contributed to growth. In 1832 the steam ferry ''Gosport'' began service, linking Norfolk and Portsmouth.  In 1851, the Commonwealth authorized the charter of an {{convert|80|mi|km|-1|adj=on}} railroad connecting busy port of Norfolk and the growing industrial city of [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]]. Completed in 1858, this important line was the predecessor of today's [[Norfolk Southern Railway]].\n\nOn June 7, 1855, the ship ''Benjamin Franklin'' detoured into Portsmouth for urgent repairs. The city's health officer inspected the ship, as was standard practice at the time, and suspected something was awry, despite assurances from the captain that ship was free of disease. The officer ordered that the ship be held at anchor in the harbor for 11 days. Afterwards, he returned to the ship and allowed it dock under the condition that the ship's hold not be broken. Within several days of the ship's docking, however, the first cases of [[yellow fever]] appeared in people whose homes were near the wharf. By July, the epidemic was in full outbreak and would eventually result in the deaths of over 3,000 people in the region, 2,000 of them in Norfolk. At its peak, the epidemic was claiming more than 100 lives a day in Norfolk alone.<ref>[http://www.norfolk.gov/Neighborhoods/Services/histories_1845_87.asp Norfolk from 1845\u20131887 :Neighborhood Histories : Neighborhood Services \u2013 City of Norfolk, VA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The city's population did not reach that of the 1850 census again until after the Civil War. In 1856 the Sisters of Charity founded St. Vincent's Hospital, in part as a reaction to the previous year's epidemic.\n\n==American Civil War==\n{{See also|Virginia in the American Civil War}}\nIn early 1861, Norfolk voters instructed their delegate to vote for ratification of the ordinance of secession. Soon thereafter, Virginia voted to secede from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] became the capital of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], and the American Civil War began.\n\nWhen Virginia joined the Confederate States of America they demanded the surrender of all Federal property in their state, including the [[Norfolk Navy Yard]] (then called the Gosport Shipyard). Falling for an elaborate Confederate ruse orchestrated by civilian railroad builder, and future Confederate general, [[William Mahone]], the Union shipyard commander [[Charles Stewart McCauley]] ordered the burning of the shipyard and the evacuation of its personal to Fort Monroe across Hampton Roads. The capture of the shipyard allowed a tremendous amount of war material to fall into Confederate hands including the remains of the burned and scuttled naval frigate [[USS Merrimack (1855)|USS ''Merrimac'']].\n\nIn the spring of 1862, the remains of the USS ''Merrimac'' were rebuilt at Norfolk Navy Yard as an ironclad and renamed as the [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']]. The [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] began on March 8. The battle would ultimately ended in a stalemate however, as neither navy was able to do significant damage to the other due to the heavy armor plating. Over the next several months, CSS ''Virginia'' tried in vain to engage the ''Monitor'', but the USS Monitor was under strict orders not to fight unless absolutely necessary.<ref name=\"Monitor-Merrimac\">{{cite web\n| url = http://americancivilwar.com/monitor.html\n| title = Battle of the Monitor and the Merrimac\n| accessdate = 2007-10-09\n| publisher = Americancivilwar.com\n}}</ref>\n\nOn May 6, while the Union Army under General [[George B. McClellan]] was fighting the [[Peninsula Campaign]], President [[Abraham Lincoln]] visited [[Fort Monroe]] across Hampton Roads.  Recognizing the value of Norfolk, he decided on a plan to capture the city and thus eliminate the base for the CSS ''Virginia''. On May 8, Union ships, including the USS Monitor and batteries on Fort Wool opened fire on the Confederate batteries on Sewell's Point. Only the approach of the CSS ''Virginia'' drove the Union ships back to the protection of Fort Monroe. At this point, Lincoln directed the invasion to be on Willoughby Spit, away from the Confederate batteries, the next day. On the morning of May 10, General [[John Wool]] landed 6,000 Union soldiers on Willoughby Spit. Within hours, the Union troops arrived at Norfolk. Mayor William Lamb surrendered the city without firing a shot.<ref>https://pilotonline.com/news/local/history/back-in-the-day/article_e0147388-53a6-5cb7-a687-52506ae21aca.html</ref>\n\nFor the duration of the Civil War, the city was held under [[Martial law]]. Many private and public buildings were confiscated for federal use, including nearby plantations. Mayor Lamb did manage to successfully hide the city's colonial era silver mace underneath a fireplace hearth to avoid having it confiscated or melted down by union troops.<ref name=\"Norfolk History Chapter 46\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/highlights/46.html\n| title = Lincoln Plans the Recapture of Norfolk\n| accessdate = 2007-10-09\n| publisher = Norfolk Historical Society\n}}</ref>\n\nEnslaved African Americans did not wait until the end of the war to be emancipated. With the arrival of Union troops, thousands of slaves escaped to Norfolk and Fort Monroe to claim their freedom. Even before the arrival of northern missionaries, African Americans began to set up schools for children and adults both.\n\n==Reconstruction to the Jamestown Exposition (1865\u20131907)==\n[[File:Jamestown logo 1907.jpg|thumb|right|Logo for Jamestown Exposition in 1907]]\nBy 1870, the end of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] was at hand in Norfolk. Union occupation troops withdrew and Virginia was readmitted to the Union. During this time, African-Americans throughout Hampton Roads were elected to state and local offices. Gradually they were restricted from office and voting by the whites' paramilitary violence and intimidation, and increasingly discriminatory legislation, including [[Jim Crow Laws]] to control work, segregated public facilities and transportation, and other aspects of life.\n\nMost significantly, in 1902 Virginia joined other Southern states in creating a new constitution that effectively disfranchised all African Americans through creating new blocks to voter registration that were selectively and subjectively applied against them. White supremacists achieved their goal: from 1900 to 1904, estimated black voter turnout in the Presidential elections in Virginia dropped to zero.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H. Pildes, \"Democracy, Anti-Democracy and the Canon\", ''Constitutional Commentary'', vol.17, 2000, p.12] accessed 10 Mar 2008</ref>\n\nAfrican Americans would not regain the ability to exercise suffrage and full civil rights until their activism in the Civil Rights Movement secured passage of federal legislation in the mid-1960s. Despite this severe restriction, many African Americans created families, churches, schools, community organizations and stable lives for themselves. Many became landowners and farmed small plots in the Norfolk area. The area's turn to mixed agriculture before the Civil War created a more favorable environment for small plots and mixed produce.\n\n[[File:Norfolk.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the city of Norfolk and Norfolk County, Virginia, 1895]]\nIn 1883, the first car of [[bituminous coal]] arrived from the Pocahontas fields over the [[Norfolk & Western Railway]] and by 1886 the tracks were extended right up to the coal piers at [[Lambert's Point]] to handle the increasing volume, creating one of the largest coal transshipment ports in the world. In 1894, classes began in the city's first public high school. That same year the new technology of the [[Electric trolley|electric street railway]] was introduced to Norfolk and would, within ten years, link Norfolk with [[Sewell's Point]], [[Ocean View, Virginia|Ocean View]], [[South Norfolk, Virginia|South Norfolk]], [[Berkley, Virginia|Berkley]], Pinner's Point (all of which were independent communities within Norfolk County at that time), and the neighboring City of Portsmouth.\n\n1907 brought both the [[Virginian Railway]] and the [[Jamestown Exposition]] to [[Sewell's Point]]. The large [[Naval Review]] at the Exposition demonstrated the peninsula's favorable location, laying the groundwork for the world's largest naval base. Commemorating the 300th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, the exposition brought many prominent people including President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], congressmen, senators, and diplomats from 21 countries. [[Henry Huttleston Rogers]] and [[Mark Twain]] also attended the expo. Many naval ships from different countries were present for the celebration.  The area where the exposition took would become Naval Air Station Hampton Roads, later [[Naval Station Norfolk]], ten years later in 1917, during the height of World War I.<ref name=\"Jamestown Exposition\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.twainquotes.com/TwainRogersVA.html\n| title = Mark Twain and Henry Huttleston Rogers in Virginia\n| accessdate = 2007-10-02\n| publisher = http://www.twainquotes.com\n}}</ref>\n\n===Resort areas and transportation development===\nResort areas in remote areas along the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean grew in the period after the civil war as Norfolk residents embraced the concept of the day trips to the beaches.

Originally named the Ocean View Railroad, it was later known as the Norfolk and Ocean View Railroad.<ref name=\"norfolkhistory.com\" /> A small steam locomotive named the ''General William B. Mahone'' hauled ever increasing volumes of passengers, primarily on the weekends. Similarly, the Norfolk & Virginia Beach Railway inaugurated rail service in 1883 <ref>http://www.npl.lib.va.us/history/history48.html</ref> to the rural community of [[Seatack, Virginia|Seatack]] located on the Atlantic Ocean in [[Princess Anne County, Virginia|Princess Anne County]]. The oceanfront area at Seatack became the site of the area's first resort hotel.\n\nAs attendance boomed, in both instances, the steam-powered services between downtown Norfolk and the beaches at Ocean View and Seatack were later replaced by [[electric railway|electric-powered trolley cars]]. These in turn, were later replaced by highways and the automobile. Cottage Toll Road, later largely superseded by [[Tidewater Drive]] led to Ocean View. Leading from Norfolk to Seatack, where the resort strip became known as Virginia Beach, in 1922, the new hard-surfaced [[Virginia Beach Boulevard]] was a major factor in the growth of the Oceanfront town and adjacent portions of Princess Anne County.\n\nOcean View gradually evolved into a [[streetcar suburb]], and was annexed by Norfolk in 1923. Virginia Beach became an incorporated town in 1906, and an independent city of the second class in 1952, sharing courts and some constitutional officers with Princess Anne County. 11 years later, the {{convert|2|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} city was politically consolidated with county (which was 100 times larger in land area)to form the modern City of Virginia Beach, now the City of Norfolk's neighbor to the east, part of a wave of political consolidations in the Hampton Roads region which took place between 1952 and 1976.\n\n==Modern Era==\n\n===Expansion through annexation (1906\u20131959)===\n[[File:Norfolk Union Terminal Station.jpg|thumb|The [[Norfolk Terminal Station]] which opened in 1912]]\nNorfolk continued to grow in the first half of the 20th century as it expanded its borders through annexation.

Board of Education]]'' Supreme Court decision determined that racial segregation in public schools (and public accommodations) was unconstitutional. However, Virginia pursued a policy to avoid desegregation that came to be called [[Massive Resistance]]. Among the actions were new state laws, called the [[Stanley plan]], that prohibited state funding for integrated public schools, even as some school districts began to contemplate them. It was a few years after ''Brown'' until the policy was tested.\n\nNorfolk's private schools had been integrated four years before as the city chose to voluntarily comply with the ''Brown'' decision. However, a number of public [[school division]]s (school districts) around the state had been reluctant to do so for fear of losing state funds. In 1958, Federal District Courts in Virginia ordered schools in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]], [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]], Norfolk, and [[Warren County, Virginia|Warren County]], to desegregate. In the fall of 1958, a handful of public schools in three of these widespread areas opened for the first time on a racially integrated basis. In response, [[Virginia Governor]] [[James Lindsay Almond, Jr.|J. Lindsay Almond Jr.]] ordered the schools to be closed, including six of the [[Norfolk Public Schools]]: Granby High School, Maury High School, Norview High School, Blair Junior High School, Northside Junior High School, and Norview Junior High School.\n\nIn Norfolk, the state action had the impact of locking ten thousand children out of school, which raised outcry by the public to a high level. As some children attended makeshift schools in churches, etc., the citizens voted whether to reopen the public schools. The ballot made clear that the Commonwealth of Virginia would stop funding integrated schools.\n\nOn January 19, 1959, the [[Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals]] declared the state law to be in conflict with Virginia's state constitution. The Court of Appeals ordered all public schools to be funded, whether integrated or not. Governor Almond capitulated about ten days later and asked the sitting [[Virginia General Assembly|General Assembly]] to rescind several \"Massive Resistance\" laws.<ref name=\"Massive Resistance\">{{cite web| url = http://www.vahistorical.org/civilrights/massiveresistance.htm| title = Massive Resistance \u2013 The Civil Rights Movement in Virginia| accessdate = 2007-08-09| publisher = Virginia Historical Society| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080915113935/http://www.vahistorical.org/civilrights/massiveresistance.htm| archive-date = 2008-09-15| url-status = dead}}</ref> On February 2, 1959, Norfolk's public schools were [[racial segregation|desegregated]] when 17 black children entered six previously all-white schools in Norfolk.<ref name=\"6of6series\">{{cite news|title=17 Students Break Through Color Barrier|last=Watson Batts|first=Denise|date=2008-10-03|work=The Virginian Pilot|publisher=Landmark Communications|pages=1, 14\u201315}}</ref> ''[[Virginian-Pilot]]'' editor [[Lenoir Chambers]] editorialized against [[massive resistance]], earning the [[Pulitzer Prize]].<ref name=\"Lenoir Chambers\">{{cite web | url = http://www.landmarkcom.com/about/history.php | title = Landmark Communications Company History | accessdate = 2007-10-11 | publisher = Landmark Communications | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071009234858/http://www.landmarkcom.com/about/history.php | archivedate = 2007-10-09 }}</ref>\n\n===Decline and revitalization (1960 onward)===\n[[File:Monticello Arcade interior, ca 1986 CROPPED.jpg|right|thumb|Historic [[Monticello Arcade]] ]]\nAs the traditional center of [[shipping]] and [[port]] activities in the Hampton Roads region, Norfolk's downtown waterfront historically played host to numerous port and shipping-related uses. With the advent of containerized shipping in the mid-20th century, the shipping uses located on Norfolk's downtown [[Dock (maritime)|waterfront]] became obsolete as larger and more modern port facilities opened elsewhere in the region. In the second half of the century, Norfolk had a vibrant retail community in its suburbs. Norfolk was also the birthplace of Econo-Travel, now [[Econo Lodge]], one of the nation's first discount motel chains.\n\nSimilarly, the advent of newer [[suburban]] shopping destinations spelled demise for the fortunes of downtown's [[Granby Street]] commercial corridor, located just a few blocks inland from the waterfront. Granby Street traditionally played the role as the premiere shopping and gathering spot in the Hampton Roads region and numerous department stores such as [[Smith & Welton]] (1898\u20131988), Rice's (1918\u20131985) and [[Ames and Brownley]] (1898\u20131973), hotels and theaters once lined its sidewalks. However, new suburban shopping developments promised more convenience and comfort to the population that had moved to the suburbs. [[Pembroke Mall]] in Virginia Beach, the region's first climate-controlled [[shopping mall]], and JANAF Shopping Center in Norfolk's Military Circle area, were built in this era.\n\nBeginning in the 1970s, Norfolk worked towards reviving its urban core:\n\n====Granby Street====\nTo compete with suburban shopping destinations, Norfolk city leaders tried to create a similar mall experience on Granby Street. The city rebranded its commercial core the \"Granby Street Mall\", closed Granby Street to through-traffic and created a pedestrian mall. The Granby Street Mall did not succeed and the mall endured hardship through the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\n====Waterfront developments====\n[[File:Waterside Norfolk.jpg|right|thumb|Waterside]]\nAnother focus was the waterfront and its decaying piers and warehouses. Norfolk, using Federal urban renewal funds, began large-scale demolitions downtown. This included slum housing that, in the mid-20th century, did not have indoor plumbing or access to running water. The former City Market, [[Norfolk Terminal Station]] (the Union railroad station) and [[The Monticello Hotel]] were also demolished.\n\nAt the water's edge, nearly all of the obsolete shipping and warehousing facilities were demolished and replaced with a new boulevard, Waterside Drive. Among the buildings erected were the\n* Waterside Festival Marketplace, an indoor mall similar to Baltimore's [[Inner Harbor]] Pavilions\n* Waterfront [[Town Point Park]], an esplanade park with wide open riverfront views\n* Norfolk [[Omni Hotel]].\n\nOn the inland side of Waterside Drive, the demolition of the warehouses and wharves made way for high rise buildings.\n[[File:Wisconsin museum.JPG|right|thumb|Nauticus]]\n\n====MacArthur Center====\nIn the mid 1990s, Norfolk again attempted to rejuvenate Granby Street, which continued to lag behind the waterfront in terms of revitalization. In late 1996, it was announced that a new downtown shopping mall would be built, in which [[Nordstrom]] would to open a store. The mall was named the MacArthur Center, in honor of the five-star World War II General whose tomb was located across the street from the proposed site. Nearly $100 million dollars in public funds was committed to infrastructure improvements and construction of parking garages to support the shopping mall. The MacArthur Center opened in March 1999 as a three-story enclosed shopping mall with an 18-screen stadium seating [[movie theater]].\n\n====Other developments====\nThe residential population of downtown continues to grow as commercial buildings are converted into residences and new residential developments are built.\n\n{{citation needed span|text=Publications such as the American Planning Association's monthly ''[[Planning Magazine]]'', have hailed the tremendous rebound in the downtown residential population, and ''[[Money Magazine]]'' proclaimed Norfolk as the number one city in which to live in the South in 1999.|date=November 2012}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of Norfolk, Virginia]]\n* [[List of newspapers in Virginia in the 18th-century]]: Norfolk\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{See also|Timeline of Norfolk, Virginia#Bibliography}}\n\n{{Norfolk, Virginia}}\n\n[[Category:History of Norfolk, Virginia]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=November 2012}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 200\n | footer = Norfolk Bicentennial half-dollar (1936)\n | image1 = Norfolk bicentennial half dollar commemorative obverse.jpg\n | alt1 = Obverse\n | caption1 = Obverse\n | image2 = Norfolk bicentennial half dollar commemorative reverse.jpg\n | alt2 = Reverse\n | caption2 = Reverse\n }}\n{{History of Virginia}}\nThe '''history of [[Norfolk, Virginia]]''' as a modern settlement begins in 1636. The city formally was incorporated in 1736. The city was burned by orders of the outgoing [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[Colony of Virginia]] [[Governor of Virginia|colonial governor]] in 1776 during the second year of the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u20131783), although it was soon rebuilt.\n\nThe 19th century proved to be a time of numerous travails for both the city of Norfolk, and the region as whole. War, epidemics, fires, and economic depression reduced the development of the city. The city grew into the region's economic hub. By the late 19th century, the [[Norfolk and Western Railway]] with its line to the west established the community as a major [[coal]] ore exporting port and built a large trans-loading facility at [[Lambert's Point]]. It became the terminus for numerous other  railroads, linking its ports to inland regions of Virginia and North Carolina, and at the turn of the 20th century, the coal mining regions of [[Appalachia]] were well connected to the port on the [[East coast of the United States|East Coast]]. [[Princess Anne County, Virginia|Princess Anne]] and [[Norfolk County, Virginia|Norfolk]] counties would become leaders in truck farming, producing over half of all greens and potatoes consumed on the East Coast. [[Lynnhaven, Virginia|Lynnhaven]] oysters also became a major export.\n\nThe region's [[African Americans]] achieved full emancipation following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] (1861\u20131865), after the initial [[Emancipation Proclamation]] by 16th President  [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1862\u20131863, supplemented later by the three post-war [[United States Constitution|constitutional amendments]] during the [[Reconstruction era]] (1865\u20131877), only to be faced with severe discrimination through white legislators' later imposition by the 1890s of [[Jim Crow Laws]]. After Virginia passed a new post-war state constitution, African Americans were essentially disfranchised for more than 60 years until their leadership and activism won passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s.\nIn 1907, it was host to the Jamestown Exposition commemorating the tercennary (300th anniversary) of the first [[Kingdom of England|English]] settlement at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] on the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]], the only world's fair to ever be held in Virginia. As a result of its publicity and visits by high-ranking officials during the exposition (in which the [[Great White Fleet]], of 26th President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] with the rebuilt [[United States Navy]] after the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] of 1898 was launched from [[Hampton Roads]] harbor), it became the later location of the [[Norfolk Naval Station]].\n\nToday, the city of Norfolk is a major American naval and world shipping hub, as well as the center of the [[Hampton Roads]] region, both on the [[Southside Virginia|southside]]  and the [[Virginia peninsula|peninsula]] to the north of the extensive harbor between the [[James River (Virginia)|James]] and [[York River (Virginia)|York Rivers]], with the railroad terminus and ship construction  port of [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]] from the 19th century on the west shore and [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]] on the south and east sides, dating back to its founding in the colonial era as Virginia's original port.\n\n==Pre-colonial==\nThe first evidence of humans inhabiting Virginia is from 9,500 BC.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nIn 1584, Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] led an expedition in search of a suitable place to establish a permanent English settlement in North America. By mid-July of that year, two of his ships had landed on [[Roanoke Island]] (now a part of [[Dare County]]). [[Arthur Barlowe]], one of Raleigh's commanders, kept a journal which states the area was inhabited by a tribe of [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]] called the [[Chesepian]]. According to Barlowe, the local Chesepians claimed that a nearby city called Skicoak was the Chesepians' greatest city. However, the exact location of ''Skicoak'' has remained undetermined.\n\nWhen [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] settlers arrived at [[Cape Henry]] (in present-day Virginia Beach) almost 23 years later in April 1607, they found no traces of ''Skicoak''. According to [[William Strachey]]'s ''The Historie of Travaile into Virginia Britanica'' (1612), the Chesepians had been wiped out by Chief [[Wahunsunacock]] (better known as [[Chief Powhatan]]), the head of the [[Virginia Peninsula]]-based [[Powhatan Confederacy]] in the intervening years.\n\n==Colonial period (1607\u20131775)==\n{{Tall image|Mace of Norfolk, Virginia in 1909.jpg|100|box height|alt=alt text|Mace of Norfolk, Virginia presented in 1754|right}}\nIn 1607, the Governor for the [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia Colony]], [[George Yeardley|Sir George Yeardley]] established four incorporations, termed \"citties\" (sic) for the developed portion of the colony. These citties were to form the basis for the government of the colony in the newly created [[House of Burgesses]], with the southeastern portion of the [[Hampton Roads]] region falling under the [[Elizabeth City (Virginia Company)|Elizabeth Cittie]] (sic) incorporation. In 1622, [[Adam Thoroughgood]] (1604\u20131640) of [[King's Lynn]], [[Norfolk]], England, became one of the earliest Englishmen to settle in the area that was to become [[South Hampton Roads]], when at the age of 18 he became an [[indentured servant]] to pay for passage to the Virginia Colony. After his period of contracted servitude was finished, he earned his freedom and soon became a leading citizen of the fledgling colony.\n\nMeanwhile, after years of continuing struggles at Jamestown, the now bankrupt [[Virginia Company]] had its royal charter revoked by [[James I of England|King James I]] in 1624 and Virginia became a crown colony. Also at this time, the King granted {{convert|500|acre|km2}} of land to Thomas Willoughby, in what is now the [[Ocean View, Virginia|Ocean View]] section of the city. The entire population of the Virginia colony was estimated to be 5,000 people at this time.\n\nIn 1629, Thoroughgood was elected to the House of Burgesses for Elizabeth Cittie.  Five years later, in 1634, the King had the colony reorganized under a system of 8 [[shires of Virginia|shires]], with much of the Hampton Roads region becoming part of [[Elizabeth City Shire]]. In 1636, Thoroughgood was granted a large land holding along the Lynnhaven River for having persuaded 105 people to settle in the colony. Thoroughgood is also credited with suggesting the name of Norfolk, in honor of his birthplace. [[New Norfolk County]] was created when the South Hampton Roads portion of Elizabeth City Shire was partitioned off in that same year. Also during this reorganization, King James granted a further {{convert|200|acre|km2}} to Willoughby. This land would become the city of Norfolk in future. Shortly thereafter, in 1637, New Norfolk County was itself split into two counties, [[Upper Norfolk County]] and [[Lower Norfolk County]]. The modern city of Norfolk is located in Lower Norfolk.\n\nIn 1649 the English couple William and Susannah Moseley migrated with their family to Lower Norfolk County. On the [[Eastern Branch Elizabeth River]] {{convert|5|mi|km}} from Norfolk, they built a manor house with Dutch-style [[gambrel roof]] which later became  known as Rolleston Hall. Rolleston Hall stood more than 200 years, until it burned down in the late 19th century.<ref name=\"rolleston.org.uk\">[http://www.rolleston.org.uk/hall/virginia.htm] Rolleston Hall</ref><ref name=\"rolleston.org.uk\" /><ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B0DE6D8123EEE34BC4950DFB166838E679FDE] The Wise and Terry Letters: Gov.

This marked the beginning of Norfolk's importance as a [[port]] city, due to its natural deepwater channels. Soon after 1673, the \"Half Moone\" fort at the site of what is now [[Town Pointe Park]]. This fort was constructed due to feared attack by the Dutch, but this threat did not materialize. Norfolk quickly grew in size, and by 1682 a charter for the establishment of the \"Towne of Lower Norfolk County\" had been issued by Parliament. Norfolk was one of only three cities in the Virginia Colony to receive a royal charter, the other two being [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] and [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]]. The town initially encompassed a land area northeast of the point of the confluence of the Eastern and [[Southern Branch Elizabeth River|Southern]] Branches of the [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]] (today the point is in downtown). In 1691, a final county subdivision took place when Lower Norfolk County was split to form [[Norfolk County, Virginia|Norfolk County]] (present day Norfolk, Chesapeake, and parts of Portsmouth) and [[Princess Anne County]] (present day Virginia Beach). Norfolk was incorporated in 1705 and re-chartered as a borough in 1736.<ref name=\"Norfolk History Chapter 6\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/highlights/06.html\n| title = The \"Half Moone\" Fort\n| accessdate = 2008-02-19\n| publisher = Norfolk Historical Society\n| language = \n}}</ref><ref name=\"Norfolk History Chapter 7\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/highlights/07.html\n| title = The Birth of \"Norfolk Towne\"\n| accessdate = 2008-02-19\n| publisher = Norfolk Historical Society\n| language = \n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1753, Lt. Governor [[Robert Dinwiddie]] presented the growing city of 4,000 with a {{convert|41|in|mm|adj=on}} long, 104 ounce silver [[ceremonial mace|mace]]. The mace was a symbol of royal authority and is currently displayed in the [[Chrysler Museum of Art]].\n\nBy 1775, Norfolk had developed into one of the most prosperous cities in Virginia. It was a major [[shipbuilding]] center and an important trans-shipment point for the export of goods such as [[tobacco]], [[maize|corn]], [[cotton]], and [[timber]] from Virginia and North Carolina, to the British Isles and beyond. In turn, goods from the [[West Indies]] such as [[rum]] and [[sugar]], and finished manufactured products from England, were imported back through Norfolk and shipped to the rest of the lower colonies. Much of the West Indies and American colonial products that flowed through the harbor were by this time produced with the use of [[slavery|slave]] labor.\n\n==Revolutionary War (1775\u20131783)==\n[[File:Cannonball lodged in church wall.jpg|thumb|Cannonball in the wall of [[Saint Paul's Episcopal Church (Norfolk, Virginia)|Saint Paul's Episcopal Church]]]]\nNorfolk had been a strong base of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] support throughout the start of the American Revolution. In the early summer of 1775, [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]], the last Royal Governor of the [[Colony of Virginia]], tried to reestablish control of the colony from Norfolk. In November, a battle took place at [[Battle of Kemp's Landing|Kemp's Landing]] which provided Dunmore and the loyalists a clear victory, but it was nonetheless clear by then that the war was escalating. The governor immediately issued [[Dunmore's Proclamation]], which promised freedom to any rebel-owned slave who joined His Majesty's forces. At the end of November, Dunmore set up a stronghold in Norfolk,<ref>[http://research.history.org/DigitalLibrary/VirginiaGazette/VGImagePopup.cfm?ID=4640&Res=HI Virginia Gazette (Dixon & Hunter)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818153354/http://research.history.org/DigitalLibrary/VirginiaGazette/VGImagePopup.cfm?ID=4640&Res=HI |date=2007-08-18 }} (2 Dec 1775, page 3) via research.history.org- accessed 2008-01-03</ref> demolishing some 30 houses in the course of its construction.

British troops also went ashore to burn down all the waterfront buildings, and thus played right into the hands of their enemies.

At the turn of the 19th century, [[Fort Norfolk (Norfolk, Virginia)|Fort Norfolk]] was constructed by the Federal government to guard the harbor.\n\nDuring the 1820s the agricultural communities of South Hampton Roads experienced a prolonged recession, resulting in the emigration of families from the region to other areas of the South, especially the frontier areas being opened for settlement. From 1820 to 1830, there was a drop in overall population of about 15,000 in [[Norfolk County, Virginia|Norfolk County]], despite the fact that other urban areas experienced significant population growth.\n\nLike other Southern states, Virginia struggled with slavery, especially as it became less important in the mixed agricultural economy that was replacing that of tobacco. Virginia considered ideas to either phase out slavery through law (see [[Thomas Jefferson Randolph]]'s 1832 resolution) or to \"repatriate\" blacks by sending them to Africa to establish a colony at Liberia. The [[American Colonization Society]] (ACS), established in 1816, was the largest of groups founded for that purpose. Many emigrants from Virginia and North Carolina embarked for Africa from Norfolk. One such emigrant was [[Joseph Jenkins Roberts]], a native of Norfolk who would go on to become the first president of [[Liberia]]. Active emigration through the ACS came to an end following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\nBy 1840, Norfolk's population was 10,920 for the borough proper (not including the rest of the county). With the concentration of population came more interest in education and culture. In 1841 an ambitious new school building was completed for Norfolk Academy, designed by Thomas U. Walter as a replica of the temple of Theseus in Athens. In 1845, Norfolk was incorporated as a city. By 1850 the city's population was approximately 14,000 persons, including 4,000 enslaved African Americans and 1,000 free blacks.\n\nTransportation improvements contributed to growth. In 1832 the steam ferry ''Gosport'' began service, linking Norfolk and Portsmouth.  In 1851, the Commonwealth authorized the charter of an {{convert|80|mi|km|-1|adj=on}} railroad connecting busy port of Norfolk and the growing industrial city of [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]]. Completed in 1858, this important line was the predecessor of today's [[Norfolk Southern Railway]].\n\nOn June 7, 1855, the ship ''Benjamin Franklin'' detoured into Portsmouth for urgent repairs. The city's health officer inspected the ship, as was standard practice at the time, and suspected something was awry, despite assurances from the captain that ship was free of disease. The officer ordered that the ship be held at anchor in the harbor for 11 days. Afterwards, he returned to the ship and allowed it dock under the condition that the ship's hold not be broken. Within several days of the ship's docking, however, the first cases of [[yellow fever]] appeared in people whose homes were near the wharf. By July, the epidemic was in full outbreak and would eventually result in the deaths of over 3,000 people in the region, 2,000 of them in Norfolk. At its peak, the epidemic was claiming more than 100 lives a day in Norfolk alone.<ref>[http://www.norfolk.gov/Neighborhoods/Services/histories_1845_87.asp Norfolk from 1845\u20131887 :Neighborhood Histories : Neighborhood Services \u2013 City of Norfolk, VA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The city's population did not reach that of the 1850 census again until after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

[[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] became the capital of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], and the [[American Civil War]] began.\n\nWhen Virginia joined the Confederate States of America they demanded the surrender of all Federal property in their state, including the [[Norfolk Navy Yard]] (then called the Gosport Shipyard). Falling for an elaborate Confederate ruse orchestrated by civilian railroad builder, and future Confederate general, [[William Mahone]], the Union shipyard commander [[Charles Stewart McCauley]] ordered the burning of the shipyard and the evacuation of its personal to Fort Monroe across Hampton Roads. The capture of the shipyard allowed a tremendous amount of war material to fall into Confederate hands including the remains of the burned and scuttled naval frigate [[USS Merrimack (1855)|USS ''Merrimac'']].\n\nIn the spring of 1862, the remains of the USS ''Merrimac'' were rebuilt at Norfolk Navy Yard as an ironclad and renamed as the [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']]. The [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] began on March 8. The battle would ultimately ended in a stalemate however, as neither navy was able to do significant damage to the other due to the heavy armor plating. Over the next several months, CSS ''Virginia'' tried in vain to engage the ''Monitor'', but the USS Monitor was under strict orders not to fight unless absolutely necessary.<ref name=\"Monitor-Merrimac\">{{cite web\n| url = http://americancivilwar.com/monitor.html\n| title = Battle of the Monitor and the Merrimac\n| accessdate = 2007-10-09\n| publisher = Americancivilwar.com\n}}</ref>\n\nOn May 6, while the Union Army under General [[George B. McClellan]] was fighting the [[Peninsula Campaign]], President [[Abraham Lincoln]] visited [[Fort Monroe]] across Hampton Roads.  Recognizing the value of Norfolk, he decided on a plan to capture the city and thus eliminate the base for the CSS ''Virginia''. On May 8, Union ships, including the USS Monitor and batteries on Fort Wool opened fire on the Confederate batteries on Sewell's Point. Only the approach of the CSS ''Virginia'' drove the Union ships back to the protection of Fort Monroe. At this point, Lincoln directed the invasion to be on Willoughby Spit, away from the Confederate batteries, the next day. On the morning of May 10, General [[John Wool]] landed 6,000 Union soldiers on Willoughby Spit. Within hours, the Union troops arrived at Norfolk. Mayor William Lamb surrendered the city without firing a shot.<ref>https://pilotonline.com/news/local/history/back-in-the-day/article_e0147388-53a6-5cb7-a687-52506ae21aca.html</ref>\n\nFor the duration of the Civil War, the city was held under [[Martial law]]. Many private and public buildings were confiscated for federal use, including nearby plantations. Mayor Lamb did manage to successfully hide the city's colonial era silver mace underneath a fireplace hearth to avoid having it confiscated or melted down by union troops.<ref name=\"Norfolk History Chapter 46\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/highlights/46.html\n| title = Lincoln Plans the Recapture of Norfolk\n| accessdate = 2007-10-09\n| publisher = Norfolk Historical Society\n}}</ref>\n\nEnslaved African Americans did not wait until the end of the war to be emancipated. With the arrival of Union troops, thousands of slaves escaped to Norfolk and Fort Monroe to claim their freedom. Even before the arrival of northern missionaries, African Americans began to set up schools for children and adults both.\n\n==Reconstruction to the Jamestown Exposition (1865\u20131907)==\n[[File:Jamestown logo 1907.jpg|thumb|right|Logo for Jamestown Exposition in 1907]]\nBy 1870, the end of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] was at hand in Norfolk. Union occupation troops withdrew and Virginia was readmitted to the Union. During this time, African-Americans throughout Hampton Roads were elected to state and local offices. Gradually they were restricted from office and voting by the whites' paramilitary violence and intimidation, and increasingly discriminatory legislation, including [[Jim Crow Laws]] to control work, segregated public facilities and transportation, and other aspects of life.\n\nMost significantly, in 1902 Virginia joined other Southern states in creating a new constitution that effectively disfranchised all African Americans through creating new blocks to voter registration that were selectively and subjectively applied against them. White supremacists achieved their goal: from 1900 to 1904, estimated black voter turnout in the Presidential elections in Virginia dropped to zero.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H. Pildes, \"Democracy, Anti-Democracy and the Canon\", ''Constitutional Commentary'', vol.17, 2000, p.12] accessed 10 Mar 2008</ref>\n\nAfrican Americans would not regain the ability to exercise suffrage and full civil rights until their activism in the Civil Rights Movement secured passage of federal legislation in the mid-1960s. Despite this severe restriction, many African Americans created families, churches, schools, community organizations and stable lives for themselves. Many became landowners and farmed small plots in the Norfolk area. The area's turn to mixed agriculture before the Civil War created a more favorable environment for small plots and mixed produce.\n\n[[File:Norfolk.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the city of Norfolk and Norfolk County, Virginia, 1895]]\nIn 1883, the first car of [[bituminous coal]] arrived from the Pocahontas fields over the [[Norfolk & Western Railway]] and by 1886 the tracks were extended right up to the coal piers at [[Lambert's Point]] to handle the increasing volume, creating one of the largest coal transshipment ports in the world. In 1894, classes began in the city's first public high school. That same year the new technology of the [[Electric trolley|electric street railway]] was introduced to Norfolk and would, within ten years, link Norfolk with [[Sewell's Point]], [[Ocean View, Virginia|Ocean View]], [[South Norfolk, Virginia|South Norfolk]], [[Berkley, Virginia|Berkley]], Pinner's Point (all of which were independent communities within Norfolk County at that time), and the neighboring City of Portsmouth.\n\n1907 brought both the [[Virginian Railway]] and the [[Jamestown Exposition]] to [[Sewell's Point]]. The large [[Naval Review]] at the Exposition demonstrated the peninsula's favorable location, laying the groundwork for the world's largest naval base. Commemorating the 300th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, the exposition brought many prominent people including President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], congressmen, senators, and diplomats from 21 countries. [[Henry Huttleston Rogers]] and [[Mark Twain]] also attended the expo. Many naval ships from different countries were present for the celebration.  The area where the exposition took would become Naval Air Station Hampton Roads, later [[Naval Station Norfolk]], ten years later in 1917, during the height of World War I.<ref name=\"Jamestown Exposition\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.twainquotes.com/TwainRogersVA.html\n| title = Mark Twain and Henry Huttleston Rogers in Virginia\n| accessdate = 2007-10-02\n| publisher = http://www.twainquotes.com\n}}</ref>\n\n===Resort areas and transportation development===\nResort areas in remote areas along the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean grew in the period after the civil war as Norfolk residents embraced the concept of the day trips to the beaches. [[Ocean View, Virginia|Ocean View]] on the bay in [[Norfolk County, Virginia|Norfolk County]] was originally surveyed for lots before the war, but establishment of a {{convert|9|mi|km|adj=on}} long [[narrow gauge railroad|narrow gauge steam passenger railroad]] service between downtown Norfolk and Ocean View <ref name=\"norfolkhistory.com\">http://www.norfolkhistory.com/ngnovrrdescrip.htm</ref> crossing what was then known as Tanner's Creek (later renamed  [[Lafayette River]]) brought the masses. Originally named the Ocean View Railroad, it was later known as the Norfolk and Ocean View Railroad.<ref name=\"norfolkhistory.com\" /> A small steam locomotive named the ''General William B. Mahone'' hauled ever increasing volumes of passengers, primarily on the weekends. Similarly, the Norfolk & Virginia Beach Railway inaugurated rail service in 1883 <ref>http://www.npl.lib.va.us/history/history48.html</ref> to the rural community of [[Seatack, Virginia|Seatack]] located on the Atlantic Ocean in [[Princess Anne County, Virginia|Princess Anne County]]. The oceanfront area at Seatack became the site of the area's first resort hotel.\n\nAs attendance boomed, in both instances, the steam-powered services between downtown Norfolk and the beaches at Ocean View and Seatack were later replaced by [[electric railway|electric-powered trolley cars]]. These in turn, were later replaced by highways and the automobile. Cottage Toll Road, later largely superseded by [[Tidewater Drive]] led to Ocean View. Leading from Norfolk to Seatack, where the resort strip became known as Virginia Beach, in 1922, the new hard-surfaced [[Virginia Beach Boulevard]] was a major factor in the growth of the Oceanfront town and adjacent portions of Princess Anne County.\n\nOcean View gradually evolved into a [[streetcar suburb]], and was annexed by Norfolk in 1923. Virginia Beach became an incorporated town in 1906, and an independent city of the second class in 1952, sharing courts and some constitutional officers with Princess Anne County. 11 years later, the {{convert|2|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} city was politically consolidated with county (which was 100 times larger in land area)to form the modern City of Virginia Beach, now the City of Norfolk's neighbor to the east, part of a wave of political consolidations in the Hampton Roads region which took place between 1952 and 1976.\n\n==Modern Era==\n\n===Expansion through annexation (1906\u20131959)===\n[[File:Norfolk Union Terminal Station.jpg|thumb|The [[Norfolk Terminal Station]] which opened in 1912]]\nNorfolk continued to grow in the first half of the 20th century as it expanded its borders through annexation.

The Norfolk Naval Base grew rapidly as a result of World War I and this created a housing shortage in the area. These newly incorporated areas grew rapidly along with the 1906-created [[Larchmont]] neighborhood, five miles (8&nbsp;km) from downtown. [[Wards Corner, Virginia|Wards Corner]], then just outside Norfolk, became the first non-downtown shopping district in the country. In 1930, [[Old Dominion University]] was established as the Norfolk Division of the [[College of William & Mary]].

Board of Education]]'' Supreme Court decision determined that racial segregation in public schools (and public accommodations) was unconstitutional. However, Virginia pursued a policy to avoid desegregation that came to be called [[Massive Resistance]]. Among the actions were new state laws, called the [[Stanley plan]], that prohibited state funding for integrated public schools, even as some school districts began to contemplate them. It was a few years after ''Brown'' until the policy was tested.\n\nNorfolk's private schools had been integrated four years before as the city chose to voluntarily comply with the ''Brown'' decision. However, a number of public [[school division]]s (school districts) around the state had been reluctant to do so for fear of losing state funds. In 1958, Federal District Courts in Virginia ordered schools in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]], [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]], Norfolk, and [[Warren County, Virginia|Warren County]], to desegregate. In the fall of 1958, a handful of public schools in three of these widespread areas opened for the first time on a racially integrated basis. In response, [[Virginia Governor]] [[James Lindsay Almond, Jr.|J. Lindsay Almond Jr.]] ordered the schools to be closed, including six of the [[Norfolk Public Schools]]: Granby High School, Maury High School, Norview High School, Blair Junior High School, Northside Junior High School, and Norview Junior High School.\n\nIn Norfolk, the state action had the impact of locking ten thousand children out of school, which raised outcry by the public to a high level. As some children attended makeshift schools in churches, etc., the citizens voted whether to reopen the public schools. The ballot made clear that the Commonwealth of Virginia would stop funding integrated schools.\n\nOn January 19, 1959, the [[Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals]] declared the state law to be in conflict with Virginia's state constitution. The Court of Appeals ordered all public schools to be funded, whether integrated or not. Governor Almond capitulated about ten days later and asked the sitting [[Virginia General Assembly|General Assembly]] to rescind several \"Massive Resistance\" laws.<ref name=\"Massive Resistance\">{{cite web| url = http://www.vahistorical.org/civilrights/massiveresistance.htm| title = Massive Resistance \u2013 The Civil Rights Movement in Virginia| accessdate = 2007-08-09| publisher = Virginia Historical Society| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080915113935/http://www.vahistorical.org/civilrights/massiveresistance.htm| archive-date = 2008-09-15| url-status = dead}}</ref> On February 2, 1959, Norfolk's public schools were [[racial segregation|desegregated]] when 17 black children entered six previously all-white schools in Norfolk.<ref name=\"6of6series\">{{cite news|title=17 Students Break Through Color Barrier|last=Watson Batts|first=Denise|date=2008-10-03|work=The Virginian Pilot|publisher=Landmark Communications|pages=1, 14\u201315}}</ref> ''[[Virginian-Pilot]]'' editor [[Lenoir Chambers]] editorialized against [[massive resistance]], earning the [[Pulitzer Prize]].<ref name=\"Lenoir Chambers\">{{cite web | url = http://www.landmarkcom.com/about/history.php | title = Landmark Communications Company History | accessdate = 2007-10-11 | publisher = Landmark Communications | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071009234858/http://www.landmarkcom.com/about/history.php | archivedate = 2007-10-09 }}</ref>\n\n===Decline and revitalization (1960 onward)===\n[[File:Monticello Arcade interior, ca 1986 CROPPED.jpg|right|thumb|Historic [[Monticello Arcade]] ]]\nAs the traditional center of [[shipping]] and [[port]] activities in the [[Hampton Roads]] region, Norfolk's downtown waterfront historically played host to numerous port and shipping-related uses. With the advent of containerized shipping in the mid-20th century, the shipping uses located on Norfolk's downtown [[Dock (maritime)|waterfront]] became obsolete as larger and more modern port facilities opened elsewhere in the region. In the second half of the century, Norfolk had a vibrant retail community in its suburbs. Norfolk was also the birthplace of Econo-Travel, now [[Econo Lodge]], one of the nation's first discount motel chains.\n\nSimilarly, the advent of newer [[suburban]] shopping destinations spelled demise for the fortunes of downtown's [[Granby Street]] commercial corridor, located just a few blocks inland from the waterfront. Granby Street traditionally played the role as the premiere shopping and gathering spot in the Hampton Roads region and numerous department stores such as [[Smith & Welton]] (1898\u20131988), Rice's (1918\u20131985) and [[Ames and Brownley]] (1898\u20131973), hotels and theaters once lined its sidewalks. However, new suburban shopping developments promised more convenience and comfort to the population that had moved to the suburbs. [[Pembroke Mall]] in Virginia Beach, the region's first climate-controlled [[shopping mall]], and JANAF Shopping Center in Norfolk's Military Circle area, were built in this era.\n\nBeginning in the 1970s, Norfolk worked towards reviving its urban core:\n\n====Granby Street====\nTo compete with suburban shopping destinations, Norfolk city leaders tried to create a similar mall experience on Granby Street. The city rebranded its commercial core the \"Granby Street Mall\", closed Granby Street to through-traffic and created a pedestrian mall. The Granby Street Mall did not succeed and the mall endured hardship through the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\n====Waterfront developments====\n[[File:Waterside Norfolk.jpg|right|thumb|Waterside]]\nAnother focus was the waterfront and its decaying piers and warehouses. Norfolk, using Federal urban renewal funds, began large-scale demolitions downtown. This included slum housing that, in the mid-20th century, did not have indoor plumbing or access to running water. The former City Market, [[Norfolk Terminal Station]] (the Union railroad station) and [[The Monticello Hotel]] were also demolished.\n\nAt the water's edge, nearly all of the obsolete shipping and warehousing facilities were demolished and replaced with a new boulevard, Waterside Drive. Among the buildings erected were the\n* Waterside Festival Marketplace, an indoor mall similar to Baltimore's [[Inner Harbor]] Pavilions\n* Waterfront [[Town Point Park]], an esplanade park with wide open riverfront views\n* Norfolk [[Omni Hotel]].\n\nOn the inland side of Waterside Drive, the demolition of the warehouses and wharves made way for high rise buildings.\n[[File:Wisconsin museum.JPG|right|thumb|Nauticus]]\n\n====MacArthur Center====\nIn the mid 1990s, Norfolk again attempted to rejuvenate Granby Street, which continued to lag behind the waterfront in terms of revitalization. In late 1996, it was announced that a new downtown shopping mall would be built, in which [[Nordstrom]] would to open a store. The mall was named the MacArthur Center, in honor of the five-star World War II General whose tomb was located across the street from the proposed site. Nearly $100 million dollars in public funds was committed to infrastructure improvements and construction of parking garages to support the shopping mall. The MacArthur Center opened in March 1999 as a three-story enclosed shopping mall with an 18-screen stadium seating [[movie theater]].\n\n====Other developments====\nThe residential population of downtown continues to grow as commercial buildings are converted into residences and new residential developments are built.\n\n{{citation needed span|text=Publications such as the American Planning Association's monthly ''[[Planning Magazine]]'', have hailed the tremendous rebound in the downtown residential population, and ''[[Money Magazine]]'' proclaimed Norfolk as the number one city in which to live in the South in 1999.|date=November 2012}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of Norfolk, Virginia]]\n* [[List of newspapers in Virginia in the 18th-century]]: Norfolk\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{See also|Timeline of Norfolk, Virginia#Bibliography}}\n\n{{Norfolk, Virginia}}\n\n[[Category:History of Norfolk, Virginia]]\n", "name_user": "Kahtar", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up, removedWP:OVERLINK(s), replaced: (sic) \u2192 {{sic}} (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Norfolk,_Virginia"}
