The explosion caused a massive amount of damage to the police station and surrounding buildings, estimated at more than A$1&nbsp;million. The Melbourne newspaper ''[[The Age]]'' reported that the blast's impact was enhanced by the open-floor design of the offices, which had acted like a [[M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine|Claymore mine]], sending more shrapnel as the blast ripped through the floors and adding more pressure to the blast as it followed its path.

The caller called Commissioner Miller's office five times, the detectives traced the calls coming from a series of [[Telephone booth | public phone boxes]] in the [[St. Kilda, Victoria | St. Kilda]] area. In an attempt to get the caller to make contact, Commissioner Miller and Victoria's [[Premier of Victoria | Premier]]; [[John Cain (41st Premier of Victoria) | John Cain]] announced the $500,000 as a reward. The caller was later identified as 38 year-old industrial chemist; Vladimir Rhychta who was arrested while calling Commissioner Miller's office from a public phone box by a St. Kilda detective on the 16 April 1986 and charged with hindering a police investigation as it was found that Rhychta's information was false.<ref name=\"Foresnic\">''Forensic Investigators'' - ''S02 Ep06 Russell Street Bombing''</ref><ref>[http://www.timetoast.com/timelines/the-events-of-the-russell-street-bombing The Events of the Russell Street Bombing], timetoast.com</ref>\n\nThe taskforce then received information from a second witness who stated that they seen a male suspect parking a Commodore identical to the bomb car at around 12:30pm on the day of the bombing, the witness' description was enough to provide detectives with an [[identikit]] picture of the suspect, the identikit matched the description of career criminal; Claudio Crupi. Crupi was a career armed robber who had a hatred towards police, prior to the bombing, Crupi had been charged with a burglary and was on bail.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-day-terror-came-to-melbourne-the-russell-street-bombing-30-years-on-and-the-murder-of-angela-taylor-20160223-gn15xs.html|title=The day terror came to Melbourne: The Russell Street Bombing 30 years on and the murder of Angela Taylor|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2016-02-23|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref> In a raid on Crupi's home, taskforce detectives found a homemade device on Crupi's kitchen table. Crupi had left Melbourne shortly after bombing, making him a prime suspect. Under police questioning, Crupi admitted that he had a hatred towards a detective who worked at Russell Street but stated that the homemade device recovered in his home was a fake and was meant to planted at a police station in [[Flemington, Victoria | Flemington]].\n\nA major breakthrough in the investigation came from a police report filed three weeks prior to the bombing. On the 6 March 1986, a Victoria  Police Traffic unit was in pursuit of a stolen red [[Daimler Sovereign]] in [[East Keilor, Victoria | East Keilor]], the pursuit came to the end when the driver wrecked the Daimler. The driver fled on foot into nearby [[St. Albans, Victoria | St. Albans]] where he had carjacked a passing motorist at gunpoint and made his escape. In the boot of the Daimler, police found a [[backpack]], containing a set of [[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria | number plates]] that had been cut into pieces. When the pieces were put back together, the number plates; CCH-997 had came back to a silver [[Holden Commodore (VK)#SS | VK Commodore HDT]] that had also been stolen before the bombing. This second Commodore matched the description of a vehicle being used in a armed robbery of a bank in [[Donvale, Victoria | Donvale]] hours after the bombing in which the Commodore was used to crash into the front window of the bank. The vehicle was later recovered from the [[Yarra River]] at [[Wonga Park, Victoria | Wonga Park]] on the 7 April 1986. \n\nUpon the examination of the silver Commodore by the Victoria Police Stolen Motor Vehicles Squad, detectives discovered that the vehicle's [[Vehicle identification number | VIN]] on the chassis had been drilled out. The drill marks on the silver Commodore's VIN were found to be identical to the VIN on the Commodore used in the bombing and the silver Commodore's number plates were recovered from the Daimler, linking the stolen Daimler and the Donvale robbery to the Russell Street Bombing.  \n\nIn a statement given to the detectives, the traffic officer caught a glimpse of the driver from the Daimler during the chase and out of a series of mugshots, identified the driver as Peter Reed. Reed (born Peter Komiazyk) was a suspected armed robber and car thief.<ref>''The Russell Street Bombing''</ref> As Reed was a person of interest in several violent armed robberies and car thefts, his address and the addresses of Reed's family members and several of his associates were placed under police surveillance.\n\n==Arrests==\nOn 25 April 1986, ten [[Victoria Police]] officers raided the [[Kallista, Victoria|Kallista]] home of Peter Michael Reed at 5:45 a.m. It was alleged that upon attempting to enforce the arrest by forcing entry to the premises, Reed produced a [[.455]] [[Smith & Wesson]] [[revolver]] and fired at police, seriously wounding Detective Sergeant Mark Wylie. Reed was then fired upon by Det. Sgt. Steve Quinsee, who was also wounded and arrested.\n\nDuring the search of Reed's home, detectives found several firearms with drill marks similar to the drill marks on both the bomb car and the stolen silver Commodore. Also recovered at Reed's home was a police scanner and two detonators sitting on a backpack identical to the detonators used in the bombing. Inside of the backpack were sticks of gelignite identical to the sticks of gelignite used in the bomb car.\n\nFingerprints found on the door of the toilet at Reed's home matched to Craig Minogue and fingerprints found on the newspaper wrapped around the sticks of gelignite matched to Craig Minogue's brother; Rodney Minogue. The Minogue Brothers were both associates of Reed in which Rodney Minogue had served time in prison with Reed. \n\nPolice later raided an house of an associate known to both Reed and the Minogue Brothers in [[Nunawading, Victoria | Nunawading]]. Evidence recovered from the associate's home matched to the components used in the construction of the bomb. Under police questioning, the associate stated that he saw Craig Minogue drive the Commodore identical to the Commodore used in the bombing into the garage of the associate's home. The associate also stated that Craig Minogue had paid for the associate and his girlfriend to travel to Sydney before the bombing with the return airline ticket dated for after the bombing. The associate then stated the when he and his girlfriend returned from Sydney, he saw the Minogue Brothers moving out from the associate's home.\n\n==Trial==\nReed was charged with attempted murder, recklessly causing serious injury, using a firearm to prevent apprehension and possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances in addition to charges related to the Russell Street bombing. Reed later reportedly stated at his trial in unsworn evidence that ''\"the police started the shooting and I only used [my] firearm in self defence.\"''\n\nThe Crown did not allege that any person played any particular role in the bombing, but that each of them were members of a team which planned the bombing and caused the bomb to explode. Evidence against the accused was as follows:\n* Gelignite and detonators used in the construction of the bomb were of the same type as those stolen from a mine.\n* Gelignite was found at Reed's house wrapped in newspaper containing [[fingerprint]]s belonging to Rodney Minogue.\n* Craig Minogue owned a pair of side cutters which produced cuts similar to those found on detonator wires.\n* a file with traces of brass deposits matched with brass deposits found at the bomb site.\n* a block of wood from which a wooden part of the bomb had been sawn was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* tinned copper wire, similar to that used with detonators found at the bomb site, was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* residue of gelignite matched residue found at a previous address of Craig Minogue in Lower [[Templestowe]].\n* evidence from a witness that Craig Minogue called around Easter 1986, to ask about the use of detonators.\n* a witness testified that Craig Minogue was seen driving a 1979 Holden Commodore around the CBD prior to the explosion.\n* another witness testified that before the bombing, that they discovered a box of explosives at a house they shared with the Minogue Brothers and was told by Craig Minogue to \"forget what they seen\".\n\nAt the end of a six month trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1988 before His Honour Justice Vincent, Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing.  Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, and was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\n\nTaylor was sentenced to life imprisonment with no minimum term (ie never to be released), the first person in Victoria to be so sentenced.  Taylor died in prison at the age of 79.[https://www.news.com.au/national/victoria/news/stanley-taylor-died-from-natural-causes-while-in-custody/news-story/fb57c49ed0d9e69c35c3a933bf5af30a] Craig Minogue was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 28 years.

Dayton Ballet seasons typically comprises four works\u2014familiar traditional ballets, such as ''The Nutcracker'', as well as new and innovative works\u2014and over 40 performances.\n\nThe Dayton Ballet performs in the historic 1,139-seat Victoria Theatre and the 2,300-seat Schuster Center.\n\nPart of [[The Dayton Performing Arts Alliance]], which also oversees the Dayton Opera and the Dayton Philharmonic, the Ballet receives administrative and operational leadership and support from its parent organization. Karen Russo Burke has been the Artistic Director of the Dayton Ballet since 2011.\n\n==History==\n\nDayton Ballet had its beginning when Josephine (Jo) Schwarz and her sister Hermene opened The Schwarz School of Dance in 1927. Jo Schwarz later studied ballet and danced in Chicago, in New York at the School of American Ballet, and in Europe. She danced on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], but was forced to return home to Dayton after being injured while performing there. In May 1938, Jo and Hermene gathered together the school's finest dancers, named the troupe \"The Experimental Group for Young Dancers,\" and staged a performance at the [[Dayton Art Institute]]. This was the first performance of what is now the Dayton Ballet.\n\nJo was a pioneer of the American regional ballet movement of the mid-20th century. Through years of persistence, she made Dayton a center of dance. In 1958, the company restructured as the Dayton Civic Ballet, with a board of directors, and federal tax-exempt status. In 1959, the Dayton Civic Ballet became a chartered member of the Northeast Regional Ballet Association. The Schwarz sisters organized many regional dance festivals and choreography conferences.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E6DB173FF931A35750C0A9629C8B63| title= Josephine Schwarz, 95, Leader In Growth of Regional Ballets|accessdate=2011-01-01 | work=The New York Times|first=Jack|last=Anderson|date=2004-03-02}}</ref> In 1978, the company dropped the \"Civic\" designation and became the fully professional Dayton Ballet.\n\n===1980\u20131990===\nStuart Sebastian, a student of Josephine and Hermene Schwarz, assumed directorship of the company in 1980 at the invitation of Josephine Schwarz. He had danced professionally for the Dayton Ballet and the National Ballet of Washington before assuming the role. He had also choreographed in New York, Germany and England.<ref name=NYT/>  Sebastian led the Dayton Ballet for 10 years, in which time the company rose in stature and status. \n\nSebastian brought in new dancers and created the company's first full-length ballet, ''The Sleeping Beauty''.  He choreographed over 25 new works.  Of those, six were full-length ballets, including Swan Lake and Dracula. Under Sebastian, the Dayton Ballet toured more than 75 cities and took its first international tour to Jerash, Jordan.  In 1988, the company appeared on national television while performing in the opening ceremonies of the [[1987 Pan American Games|Pan American Games]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tV3CKGuGoRkC&pg=PT243&lpg=PT243&dq=dayton+ballet+pan+american+games&source=bl&ots=c-EPKDXr3O&sig=4keiRS62DiKjfFgexl5Qtr1Eqhc&hl=en&ei=wAEgTfX8Hoep8Aas4umODg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=dayton%20ballet%20pan%20american%20games&f=false| title= profiles of Ohio women 1803-2003|accessdate=2011-01-01}}</ref>\n\n===Transition: 1991-1993===\nFollowing the departure of Stuart Sebastian in 1990 and his subsequent death in January 1991 after a lengthy battle with AIDS,<ref name=NYT/> the company entered a period of transition. James Clouser, former artistic director of the [[Houston Ballet]], was brought in on a three year contract. It was a bumpy and tumultuous time for the company, and a time of considerable change. Clouser was the first outside, non-Daytonian director, the Dayton Ballet had ever seen, and was a considerable break from the company's past directors. Many dancers and staff from the previous era left, and many new dancers and staff were hired. According to ''[[Dayton Daily News]]'' articles written during the transition, the board of trustees was looking for change and that is why they brought in someone from the outside. In the fall of 1992 an executive director was brought in for the very first time in the company's history: Dermot Burke.\n\n===Recent history: 1993\u20132012===\nDermot Burke was a star principal dancer with the [[Joffrey Ballet]] in New York and had been artistic director of the [[American Repertory Ballet]] in New Jersey for 10 years. He knew and choreographed for Sebastian and the Dayton Ballet back in 1984.

Dayton Ballet seasons typically comprises four works\u2014familiar traditional ballets, such as ''The Nutcracker'', as well as new and innovative works\u2014and over 40 performances.\n\nThe Dayton Ballet performs in the historic 1,139-seat Victoria Theatre and the 2,300-seat Schuster Center.\n\nPart of The Dayton Performing Arts Alliance, which also oversees the Dayton Opera and the Dayton Philharmonic, the Ballet receives administrative and operational leadership and support from its parent organization. Karen Russo Burke has been the Artistic Director of the Dayton Ballet since 2011.\n\n==History==\n\nDayton Ballet had its beginning when Josephine (Jo) Schwarz and her sister Hermene opened The Schwarz School of Dance in 1927. Jo Schwarz later studied ballet and danced in Chicago, in New York at the School of American Ballet, and in Europe. She danced on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], but was forced to return home to Dayton after being injured while performing there. In May 1938, Jo and Hermene gathered together the school's finest dancers, named the troupe \"The Experimental Group for Young Dancers,\" and staged a performance at the [[Dayton Art Institute]]. This was the first performance of what is now the Dayton Ballet.\n\nJo was a pioneer of the American regional ballet movement of the mid-20th century. Through years of persistence, she made Dayton a center of dance. In 1958, the company restructured as the Dayton Civic Ballet, with a board of directors, and federal tax-exempt status. In 1959, the Dayton Civic Ballet became a chartered member of the Northeast Regional Ballet Association. The Schwarz sisters organized many regional dance festivals and choreography conferences.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E6DB173FF931A35750C0A9629C8B63| title= Josephine Schwarz, 95, Leader In Growth of Regional Ballets|accessdate=2011-01-01 | work=The New York Times|first=Jack|last=Anderson|date=2004-03-02}}</ref> In 1978, the company dropped the \"Civic\" designation and became the fully professional Dayton Ballet.\n\n===1980\u20131990===\nStuart Sebastian, a student of Josephine and Hermene Schwarz, assumed directorship of the company in 1980 at the invitation of Josephine Schwarz. He had danced professionally for the Dayton Ballet and the National Ballet of Washington before assuming the role. He had also choreographed in New York, Germany and England.<ref name=NYT/>  Sebastian led the Dayton Ballet for 10 years, in which time the company rose in stature and status. \n\nSebastian brought in new dancers and created the company's first full-length ballet, ''The Sleeping Beauty''.  He choreographed over 25 new works.  Of those, six were full-length ballets, including Swan Lake and Dracula. Under Sebastian, the Dayton Ballet toured more than 75 cities and took its first international tour to Jerash, Jordan.  In 1988, the company appeared on national television while performing in the opening ceremonies of the [[1987 Pan American Games|Pan American Games]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tV3CKGuGoRkC&pg=PT243&lpg=PT243&dq=dayton+ballet+pan+american+games&source=bl&ots=c-EPKDXr3O&sig=4keiRS62DiKjfFgexl5Qtr1Eqhc&hl=en&ei=wAEgTfX8Hoep8Aas4umODg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=dayton%20ballet%20pan%20american%20games&f=false| title= profiles of Ohio women 1803-2003|accessdate=2011-01-01}}</ref>\n\n===Transition: 1991-1993===\nFollowing the departure of Stuart Sebastian in 1990 and his subsequent death in January 1991 after a lengthy battle with AIDS,<ref name=NYT/> the company entered a period of transition. James Clouser, former artistic director of the [[Houston Ballet]], was brought in on a three year contract. It was a bumpy and tumultuous time for the company, and a time of considerable change. Clouser was the first outside, non-Daytonian director, the Dayton Ballet had ever seen, and was a considerable break from the company's past directors. Many dancers and staff from the previous era left, and many new dancers and staff were hired. According to ''[[Dayton Daily News]]'' articles written during the transition, the board of trustees was looking for change and that is why they brought in someone from the outside. In the fall of 1992 an executive director was brought in for the very first time in the company's history: Dermot Burke.\n\n===Recent history: 1993\u20132012===\nDermot Burke was a star principal dancer with the [[Joffrey Ballet]] in New York and had been artistic director of the [[American Repertory Ballet]] in New Jersey for 10 years. He knew and choreographed for Sebastian and the Dayton Ballet back in 1984. In the Fall of 1993 Dermot assumed the dual role of executive and artistic director of the company.\n\nUnder Dermot Burke, the company took on a more American flavor in the tradition of the Joffrey Ballet, embracing distinctly American dance literature, dancers and choreographers.

{"title_page": "Selkirk and Galashiels Railway", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=April 2017}}\nThe '''Selkirk and Galashiels Railway''' was a railway company that built a branch line connecting [[Selkirk, Scottish Borders]], with the mainline network at [[Galashiels]]. The {{convert|5|mi|adj=on}} line opened in 1856 and was well used in the period down to 1914. Road transport from about 1923 became a serious competitor and the usage of the line declined steeply. Economy measures did little to retrieve the situation and the passenger service was withdrawn in 1951. Goods traffic continued for a period, but in 1964 that too was withdrawn. There is no railway use of the line now.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Selkirk branch.png|thumb|The Selkirk and Galashiels Railway]]\nOver many centuries the towns in [[Scottish Borders|the Borders]] had developed skills in manufacturing high-quality woollen goods, deriving originally from the abundant fellside grassland and equally abundant pure water. The intrinsic disadvantage of their location was the difficulty and expense of transporting the finished products to the market.\n\nThe [[North British Railway]] obtained Parliamentary authorisation for its mainline from [[Edinburgh]] to [[Berwick]] in 1844 and opened that line in 1846. Already in 1845 with the first line under construction, the North British was planning a long branch line to [[Hawick]], and it obtained an Act for the purpose. The NBR's purpose was to secure as much territory for itself as possible, and to connect beyond to [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], giving access to the emerging West Coast route from London as well as the East Coast. At first, this strategic objective was not advertised, and in any case Hawick as a major wool making town was a valid destination. On 9 February 1846 the North British Railway held a shareholders' meeting at which approval was given for the NBR to construct a branch line to Selkirk, but this was never carried into effect; by October 1847 shareholder discomfort with the extent of financial commitments being taken on, had reached an unbearable level.<ref name = ross>David Ross, ''The North British Railway: A History'', Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, {{ISBN|978 1 84033 647 4}}</ref>\n\nThe Hawick line and its extension to Carlisle became the [[Waverley Line|Waverley Route]], and its completion encouraged ideas of connecting other Borders towns by branch lines or otherwise.

Captain Tyler, Inspecting Officer of the Board of Trade, visited the line on 3 April 1856. He approved the line for passenger operation, but he was critical of the poor quality of the line: he reported that, \"The permanent way is of a light description and the joints of the rails are not fished. The gradients are severe and the curves sharp, and altogether the line is not fitted for heavy traffic or for high speeds.\" Moreover, the junction on the main line near Galashiels was protected by distant signals only, and they were too close to the junction, giving inadequate stopping distance for approaching trains: there were no stop signals at all. The Company agreed to make urgent changes and Tyler agreed to the line opening on the proviso of one engine in steam operation, and the use of tank engines only, as there was no turntable at the terminus.<ref name = nisbet>Alistair Nisbet, ''Willie Gow and the Selkirk Branch'', Backtrack Magazine, September 2010, Pendragon Publishing, Easingwold</ref>\n\nA local newspaper had a more benevolent view of the inspection:\n\n<blockquote>Selkirk Railway: The Government inspector went over the line on Thursday [3 April 1856], examining it carefully.

The ferry was a rowing boat, which the company hoped would encourage visitors use the station to come to [[Abbotsford House]], the former home of [[Walter Scott]]. An advertisement in 1871 announced a public roup at Fairnalee, which was \"about {{convert|3|mi|disp=sqbr}} from the Boldside station of the Edinburgh and Hawick Railway\",<ref name = boldside>''Selkirkshire: Extensive Sale of Wood'' in The Berwick Advertiser: 3 February 1871</ref> but this may reflect the advertiser's colloquial usage rather than any official name.\n\nThree months after the line opened, the running of trains on Sundays was proposed. This produced a storm of protest:\n\n<blockquote>The directors of the Selkirk and Galashiels Railway having at their last meeting passed a resolution to open the line [on Sundays] for the conveyance of mail bags and passengers, a large and enthusiastic meeting was held on the evening of Tuesday [24 June 1856]... for the purpose of entering their protest at the proposed violation of the Sabbath.<ref name = chronicle>Kelso Chronicle: 27 June 1856</ref></blockquote> However the NBR, the driving force in the matter, persisted and the Sunday trains ran.\n\nThe North British Railway absorbed the Selkirk Company on 1 July 1859.<ref group = note>According to Nisbet; Awdry, and also Thomas, say 21 July 1859; the discrepancy may be explained by an authorising Act of Parliament and the practical adoption date being separated by a few weeks. Carter says \"by Act of 12 July 1859.\"</ref><ref name = nisbet/><ref name = awdry/><ref name = carter/>\n\nThe light construction of the line had not been confined to the permanent way, and in 1868 the North British Railway found that it needed to reconstruct the timber bridge over the [[River Tweed]] with iron girders on stone piers, at a cost of over \u00a36,000.<ref name = ross/>\n\nThe number of passenger trains on the branch was increased to six by 1863 and to 13 by 1887. The Sunday trains were withdrawn in 1916 due to manpower shortages in [[World War I]], and they were never reinstated.\n\nFrom 1923 the North British Railway formed a constituent of the new [[London and North Eastern Railway]] (LNER) following the [[Railways Act 1921]], and the Selkitk and Galashiels company, only in existence to receive the NBR's rental charge, was absorbed into the LNER. In this period motor bus services began to erode passenger carryings on the line. Closure of the railway passenger service was contemplated by the LNER in 1930, but was not proceeded with, but Abbotsford Ferry station was closed from 5 January 1931. Seeking economy of working, the LNER introduced a [[Sentinel Waggon Works|Sentinel]] steam railcar on the branch from 5 January 1931; the vehicle operated all normal passenger trains. The railcar named Protector was in use from February 1931, and from December 1933 Nettle took over, continuing until August 1945 when the Sentinel railcars were taken out of service, and steam trains took over once again.<ref name = nisbet/>\n\nGoods traffic too was in decline from about 1924 due to the competition from motor lorries.\n\nBritish Railways, Scottish Region, took over the railways in the area at the beginning of 1948, on the nationalisation of the railways. At this time the passenger traffic was in serious decline, with only about 14 tickets being issued daily on the branch. In May 1951, British Railways proposed closure of the passenger service on the line, and with no objection being put forward, it was decided to close the passenger service on 10 September 1951.<ref name = paterson/> Some works outing special trains ran from Selkirk after closure until at least 1957.<ref name = nisbet/>\n\nThe station remained open for goods traffic, but that too was in decline; a review in November 1958 considered withdrawal, but for the time being the line continued in use, but on 2 November 1964 all public goods facilities were withdrawn; a private siding at Selkirk remained in use for a short time after that date. A short section of the branch at Galashiels was retained to cross the [[Gala Water]] to serve the gas works, but that too closed in October 1966, and the line was completely closed.<ref name = nisbet/><ref name = paterson/>\n\n==Topography==\nThe line left the Galashiels to Hawick line, turning south immediately before the Tweed Bridge, crossing the Gala Water, and following the west bank of the river Tweed, past Abbotsford Ferry station. The line continued south, crossing the Tweed to the east bank immediately north of the confluence of the [[Ettrick Water]], and followed close to the east bank of that river to Lindean station, at Ettrick Bridge. Continuing still not far from the Ettrick, the line ran to the terminus station at Selkirk.\n\nThe length of the line was {{convert|5+1/4|mi}} from Selkirk station to the junction with the main line (Selkirk Junction). The figure of {{convert|6+1/4|mi}} often quoted is from Selkirk station to Galashiels station, that is, partly on the main line.

An advertisement in 1871 announced a public roup at Fairnalee, which was \"about {{convert|3|mi|disp=sqbr}} from the Boldside station of the Edinburgh and Hawick Railway\",<ref name = boldside>''Selkirkshire: Extensive Sale of Wood'' in The Berwick Advertiser: 3 February 1871</ref> but this may reflect the advertiser's colloquial usage rather than any official name.\n\nThree months after the line opened, the running of trains on Sundays was proposed. This produced a storm of protest:\n\n<blockquote>The directors of the Selkirk and Galashiels Railway having at their last meeting passed a resolution to open the line [on Sundays] for the conveyance of mail bags and passengers, a large and enthusiastic meeting was held on the evening of Tuesday [24 June 1856]... for the purpose of entering their protest at the proposed violation of the Sabbath.<ref name = chronicle>Kelso Chronicle: 27 June 1856</ref></blockquote> However the NBR, the driving force in the matter, persisted and the Sunday trains ran.\n\nThe North British Railway absorbed the Selkirk Company on 1 July 1859.<ref group = note>According to Nisbet; Awdry, and also Thomas, say 21 July 1859; the discrepancy may be explained by an authorising Act of Parliament and the practical adoption date being separated by a few weeks. Carter says \"by Act of 12 July 1859.\"</ref><ref name = nisbet/><ref name = awdry/><ref name = carter/>\n\nThe light construction of the line had not been confined to the permanent way, and in 1868 the North British Railway found that it needed to reconstruct the timber bridge over the [[River Tweed]] with iron girders on stone piers, at a cost of over \u00a36,000.<ref name = ross/>\n\nThe number of passenger trains on the branch was increased to six by 1863 and to 13 by 1887. The Sunday trains were withdrawn in 1916 due to manpower shortages in [[World War I]], and they were never reinstated.\n\nFrom 1923 the North British Railway formed a constituent of the new [[London and North Eastern Railway]] (LNER) following the [[Railways Act 1921]], and the Selkitk and Galashiels company, only in existence to receive the NBR's rental charge, was absorbed into the LNER. In this period motor bus services began to erode passenger carryings on the line. Closure of the railway passenger service was contemplated by the LNER in 1930, but was not proceeded with, but Abbotsford Ferry station was closed from 5 January 1931. Seeking economy of working, the LNER introduced a [[Sentinel Waggon Works|Sentinel]] steam railcar on the branch from 5 January 1931; the vehicle operated all normal passenger trains. The railcar named Protector was in use from February 1931, and from December 1933 Nettle took over, continuing until August 1945 when the Sentinel railcars were taken out of service, and steam trains took over once again.<ref name = nisbet/>\n\nGoods traffic too was in decline from about 1924 due to the competition from motor lorries.\n\nBritish Railways, Scottish Region, took over the railways in the area at the beginning of 1948, on the nationalisation of the railways. At this time the passenger traffic was in serious decline, with only about 14 tickets being issued daily on the branch. In May 1951, British Railways proposed closure of the passenger service on the line, and with no objection being put forward, it was decided to close the passenger service on 10 September 1951.<ref name = paterson/> Some works outing special trains ran from Selkirk after closure until at least 1957.<ref name = nisbet/>\n\nThe station remained open for goods traffic, but that too was in decline; a review in November 1958 considered withdrawal, but for the time being the line continued in use, but on 2 November 1964 all public goods facilities were withdrawn; a private siding at Selkirk remained in use for a short time after that date. A short section of the branch at Galashiels was retained to cross the [[Gala Water]] to serve the gas works, but that too closed in October 1966, and the line was completely closed.<ref name = nisbet/><ref name = paterson/>\n\n==Topography==\nThe line left the Galashiels to Hawick line, turning south immediately before the Tweed Bridge, crossing the Gala Water, and following the west bank of the river Tweed, past Abbotsford Ferry station. The line continued south, crossing the Tweed to the east bank immediately north of the confluence of the [[Ettrick Water]], and followed close to the east bank of that river to Lindean station, at Ettrick Bridge. Continuing still not far from the Ettrick, the line ran to the terminus station at Selkirk.\n\nThe length of the line was {{convert|5+1/4|mi}} from Selkirk station to the junction with the main line (Selkirk Junction). The figure of {{convert|6+1/4|mi}} often quoted is from Selkirk station to Galashiels station, that is, partly on the main line. In 1960 the distance from Selkirk station to Galashiels station signalbox was quoted as 6 miles 248 yards ({{convert|10808|yd|km|disp=out}}).<ref name = sa>British Railways Scottish Region: ''Sectional Appendix to the Working Timetables and Books of Rules and Regulations: Section 2: East''; Glasgow, 1960</ref>\n\nLocation list:\n\n* ''Selkirk Junction''; diverged from the Hawick main line;\n* Abbotsford Ferry; opened 5 April 1856; closed 5 January 1931;\n* Lindean; opened 5 April 1856; closed 10 September 1951;\n* Selkirk opened 5 April 1856; closed 10 September 1951.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist | group = note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Closed railway lines in Scotland]]\n[[Category:Railway lines in Scotland]]\n[[Category:Early Scottish railway companies]]\n[[Category:North British Railway]]\n[[Category:Pre-grouping British railway companies]]\n", "name_user": "Hatchens", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selkirk_and_Galashiels_Railway"}
