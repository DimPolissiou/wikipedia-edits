As shown by the Figure, during the mid-2000s, communication capacity was more unequally distributed than during the late 1980s, when only fixed-line phones existed. The most recent increase in digital equality stems from the massive diffusion of the latest digital innovations (i.e. fixed and mobile broadband infrastructures, e.g. [[3G]] and fiber optics [[FTTH]]).<ref>SciDevNet (2014) How mobile phones increased the digital divide; http://www.scidev.net/global/data/scidev-net-at-large/how-mobile-phones-increased-the-digital-divide.html</ref>\nMeasurement methodologies of the digital divide, and more specifically an Integrated Iterative Approach General Framework (Integrated Contextual Iterative Approach \u2013 ICI) and the digital divide modeling theory under measurement model DDG (Digital Divide Gap) are  used to analyze the gap existing between developed and developing countries, and the gap among the 27 members-states of the European Union.<ref>Abdalhakim, Hawaf., (2009).

In 2001, fixed-line telecommunication penetration reached 70% of society in developed [[OECD]] countries and 10% of the developing world. This resulted in a ratio of 7 to 1 (divide in relative terms) or a difference of 60% (divide in measured in absolute terms). During the next decade, fixed-line penetration stayed almost constant in OECD countries (at 70%), while the rest of the world started a catch-up, closing the divide to a ratio of 3.5 to 1. The lower graph shows the divide not in terms of ICT devices, but in terms of kbit/s per inhabitant. While the average member of developed countries counted with 29 kbit/s more than a person in developing countries in 2001, this difference got multiplied by a factor of one thousand (to a difference of 2900 kbit/s). In relative terms, the fixed-line capacity divide was even worse during the introduction of broadband Internet at the middle of the first decade of the 2000s, when the OECD counted with 20 times more capacity per capita than the rest of the world.<ref name=\"HilbertInfoInequality\" /> This shows the importance of measuring the divide in terms of kbit/s, and not merely to count devices. The International Telecommunications Union concludes that \"the bit becomes a unifying variable enabling comparisons and aggregations across different kinds of communication technologies\".<ref name=\"ITUmeasuring2012\">[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/publications/idi/material/2012/MIS2012_without_Annex_4.pdf \"Chapter 5: Measuring communication capacity in bits and bytes\"], in Measuring the report Information Society 2012; ITU (International Telecommunication Union) (2012).</ref>\n\n===Skills and digital literacy===\nHowever, research shows that the digital divide is more than just an access issue and cannot be alleviated merely by providing the necessary equipment.

Individual Aspects of the Digital Divide in Germany|last=Schliefe|first=Katrin|date=February 2007|website=|access-date=2017-10-21}}</ref>\n\nOne telling fact is that \"as income rises so does Internet use ...\",  strongly suggesting that the digital divide persists at least in part due to income disparities.<ref>Rubin, R.E. (2010). Foundations of library and information science. 178-179. New York: Neal-Schuman Publishers.</ref> Most commonly, a digital divide stems from poverty and the economic barriers that limit resources and prevent people from obtaining or otherwise using newer technologies.\n\nIn research, while each explanation is examined, others must be controlled in order to eliminate [[interaction effects]] or [[Mediation (statistics)|mediating variables]],<ref name=\"MossbergerRacePlace\">{{cite journal | last1 = Mossberger | first1 = Karen |author-link1=Karen Mossberger | last2 = Tolbert | first2 = Caroline J. ||author-link2=Caroline Tolbert | last3 = Gilbert | first3 = Michele | year = 2006 | title = Race, Place, and Information Technology (IT) | url = https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&context=ncdg| journal = Urban Affairs Review | volume = 41 | issue = 5| pages = 583\u2013620 | doi=10.1177/1078087405283511}}</ref> but these explanations are meant to stand as general trends, not direct causes. Each component can be looked at from different angles, which leads to a myriad of ways to look at (or define) the digital divide. For example, measurements for the intensity of usages, such as incidence and frequency, vary by study. Some report usage as access to Internet and ICTs while others report usage as having previously connected to the Internet. Some studies focus on specific technologies, others on a combination (such as [[Infostate]], proposed by [[Orbicom-UNESCO]], the [[Digital Opportunity Index]], or [[ITU]]'s [[ICT Development Index]]). Based on different answers to the questions of who, with which kinds of characteristics, connects how and why to what there are hundreds of alternatives ways to define the digital divide.<ref name=\"HilbertDigDiv2011\"/> \"The new consensus recognizes that the key question is not how to connect people to a specific network through a specific device, but how to extend the expected gains from new ICTs.\" <ref>Galperin, H.

Information Technologies and International Development, 6 Special Edition, 53\u201355</ref> In short, the desired impact and \"the end justifies the definition\" of the digital divide.<ref name=\"HilbertDigDiv2011\"/>\n\n===Economic gap in the United States===\nDuring the mid-1990s, the US Department of Commerce, National Telecommunications & Information Administration (NTIA) began publishing reports about the Internet and access to and usage of the resource. The first of three reports is entitled \"Falling Through the Net: A Survey of the \u2018Have Nots\u2019 in Rural and Urban America\" (1995),<ref>National Telecommunications & Information Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce. (1995). Falling through the net: A survey of the\u2018have nots\u2019 in rural and urban America. Washington, D.C. Retrieved fromhttp://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/fallingthru.html</ref>  the second is \"Falling Through the Net II: New Data on the Digital Divide\" (1998),<ref>National Telecommunications & Information Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce. (1998). Falling through the net II: New data on the digital divide. Washington, D.C. Retrieved from http://www.ntia.doc.gov/report/1998/falling-through-net-ii-new-data-digital-divide</ref> and the final report \"Falling Through the Net: Defining the Digital Divide\" (1999).<ref name=\"ntia.doc.gov\">National Telecommunications & Information Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce. (1999). Falling through the net: Defining the digital divide. Washington, D.C. Retrieved from http://www.ntia.doc.gov/report/1999/falling-through-net-defining-digital-divide</ref>  The NTIA's final report attempted clearly to define the term digital divide; \"the digital divide\u2014the divide between those with access to new technologies and those without\u2014is now one of America's leading economic and civil rights issues. This report will help clarify which Americans are falling further behind so that we can take concrete steps to redress this gap.\"<ref name=\"ntia.doc.gov\"/> Since the introduction of the NTIA reports, much of the early, relevant literature began to reference the NTIA's digital divide definition. The digital divide is commonly defined as being between the \"haves\" and \"have-nots.\"<ref name=\"ntia.doc.gov\"/><ref>National Telecommunications & Information Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce. (1995). Falling through the net: A survey of the\u2018have nots\u2019 in rural and urban America. Washington, D.C. Retrieved from http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/fallingthru.html</ref> The economic gap really comes into play when referring to the older generations.\n\n===Racial gap===\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2020}} \nAlthough many groups in society are affected by a lack of access to computers or the internet, communities of color are specifically observed to be negatively affected by the digital divide. This is evident when it comes to observing home-internet access among different races and ethnicities. 81% of Whites and 83% of Asians have home internet access, compared to 70% of Hispanics, 68% of Blacks, 72% of American Indian/Alaska Natives, and 68% of Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders. Although income is a factor in home-internet access disparities, there are still racial and ethnic inequalities that are present among those within lower income groups. 58% of low income Whites are reported to have home-internet access in comparison to 51% of Hispanics and 50% of Blacks. This information is reported in a report titled \u201cDigital Denied: The Impact of Systemic Racial Discrimination on Home-Internet Adoption\u201d which was published by the DC-based public interest group Fress Press. The report concludes that structural barriers and discrimination that perpetuates bias against people of different races and ethnicities contribute to having an impact on the digital divide. The report also concludes that those who do not have internet access still have a high demand for it, and reduction in the price of home-internet access would allow for an increase in equitable participation and improve internet adoption by marginalized groups.<ref>https://www.freepress.net/sites/default/files/legacy-policy/digital_denied_free_press_report_december_2016.pdf</ref>\n\nDigital censorship and algorithmic bias are observed to be present in the racial divide. Hate-speech rules as well as hate speech algorithms online platforms such as Facebook have favored white males and those belonging to elite groups in society over marginalized groups in society, such as women and people of color. In a collection of internal documents that were collected in a project conducted by ProPublica, Facebook's guidelines in regards to distinguishing hate speech and recognizing protected groups revealed slides that identified three groups, each one containing either female drivers, black children, or white men. When the question of which subset group is protected is presented, the correct answer was white men . Minority group language is negatively impacted by automated tools of hate detection due to human bias that ultimately decides what is considered hate speech and what is not.\n\nOnline platforms have also been observed to tolerate hateful content towards people of color but restrict content from people of color. Aboriginal memes on a Facebook page were posted with racially abusive content and comments depicting Aboriginal people as inferior. While the contents on the page were removed by the originators after an investigation conducted by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, Facebook did not delete the page and has allowed it to remain under the classification of controversial humor . However, a post by an African American woman addressing her uncomfortableness of being the only person of color in a small-town restaurant was met with racist and hateful messages. When reporting the online abuse to Facebook, her account was suspended by Facebook for three days for posting the screenshots while those responsible for the racist comments she received were not suspended. Shared experiences between people of color can be at risk of being silenced under removal policies for online platforms.\n\n===Disability gap===\nInequities in [[access to information]] technologies are present among individuals living with a disability in comparison to those who are not living with a disability. According to The Pew Research Center, 54% of households with a person who has a disability have home internet access compared to 81% of households that have home internet access and do not have a person who has a disability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2011/01/21/americans-living-with-disability-and-their-technology-profile/|title=Americans living with disability and their technology profile|location=Washington|date=2011-01-21|website=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science & Tech|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> The type of disability an individual has can prevent one from interacting with computer screens and smartphone screens, such as having a quadriplegia disability or having a disability in the hands. However, there is still a lack of access to technology and home internet access among those who have a cognitive and auditory disability as well. There is a concern of whether or not the increase in the use of information technologies will increase equality through offering opportunities for individuals living with disabilities or whether it will only add to the present inequalities and lead to individuals living with disabilities being left behind in society. Issues such as the perception of disabilities in society, Federal and state government policy, corporate policy, mainstream computing technologies, and real-time online communication have been found to contribute to the impact of the digital divide on individuals with disabilities .\n\nPeople with disabilities are also the targets of online abuse. Online disability hate crimes have increased by 33% across the UK between 2016\u201317 and 2017-18 according to a report published by [[Leonard Cheshire Disability|Leonard Cheshire]], a health and welfare charity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/10/online-hate-against-disabled-people-rises-by-a-third|title=Online hate crime against disabled people rises by a third|date=2019-05-10|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> Accounts of online hate abuse towards people with disabilities were shared during an incident in 2019 when model Katie Price's son was the target of online abuse that was attributed to him having a disability. In response to the abuse, a campaign was launched by Katie Price to ensure that Britain's MP's held those who are guilty of perpetuating online abuse towards those with disabilities accountable.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-politics-42964068/katie-price-calls-on-mps-to-make-online-abuse-criminal-offence|title='He can't speak to defend himself, I can'|website=BBC News|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> Online abuse towards individuals with disabilities is a factor that can discourage people from engaging online which could prevent people from learning information that could improve their lives. Many individuals living with disabilities face online abuse in the form of accusations of benefit fraud and \u201cfaking\u201d their disability for financial gain, which in some cases leads to unnecessary investigations.\n\n===Gender gap===\n{{Main|Gender digital divide}}\n\nA paper published by J. Cooper from Princeton University points out that learning technology is designed to be receptive to men instead of women. The reasoning for this is that most software engineers and programmers are men, and they communicate their learning software in a way that would match the reception of their recipient. The association of computers in education is normally correlated with the male gender, and this has an impact on the education of computers and technology among women, although it is important to mention that there are plenty of learning software that are designed to help women and girls learn technology. Overall, the study presents the problem of various perspectives in society that are a result of gendered socialization patterns that believe that computers are a part of the male experience since computers have traditionally presented as a toy for boys when they are children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.pcw.gov.ph/sites/default/files/digital%20divide%20special%20case%20of%20gender.pdf}}</ref> This divide is followed as children grow older and young girls are not encouraged as much to pursue degrees in IT and computer science. In 1990, the percentage of women in computing jobs was 36%, however in 2016, this number had fallen to 25%. This can be seen in the underrepresentation of women in IT hubs such as Silicon Valley (.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/04/why-is-silicon-valley-so-awful-to-women/517788/}}</ref>\n\nThere has also been the presence of algorithmic bias that has been shown in machine learning algorithms that are implemented by major companies.{{clarify |date=March 2020 |reason=\"Major companies\", plural, is claimed, but only a single company is mentioned and referenced.}} In 2015, Amazon had to abandon a recruiting algorithm that showed a difference between ratings that candidates received for software developer jobs as well as other technical jobs. As a result, it was revealed that Amazon's machine algorithm was biased against women and favored male resumes over female resumes. This was due to the fact that Amazon's computer models were trained to vet patterns in resumes over a 10-year period. During this ten-year period, the majority of the resumes belong to male individuals, which is a reflection of male dominance across the tech industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G}}</ref>\n\n===LGBTQIA gap===\nA number of states, including some that have introduced new laws since 2010, notably censor voices from and content related to the LGBTQI community, posing serious consequences to access to information about sexual orientation and gender identity. Digital platforms play a powerful role in limiting access to certain content, such as YouTube's 2017 decision to classify non-explicit videos with LGBTQIA themes as \u2018restricted\u2019, a classification designed to filter out \u2018potentially inappropriate content\u2019.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Hunt|first=Elle|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/20/lgbt-community-anger-over-youtube-restrictions-which-make-their-videos-invisible|title=LGBT community anger over YouTube restrictions which make their videos invisible|date=2017-03-20|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The internet provides information that can create a safe space for marginalized groups such as the LGBTQIA community to connect with others and engage in honest dialogues and conversations that are affecting their communities. It can also be viewed as an agent of change for the LGBTQIA community and provide a means of engaging in social justice. It can allow for LGBTQIA individuals who may be living in rural areas or in areas where they are isolated to gain access to information that are not within their rural system as well as gaining information from other LGBT individuals. This includes information such as healthcare, partners, and news. GayHealth provides online medical and health information and Gay and Lesbians Alliance Against Defamation contains online publications and news that focus on human rights campaigns and issues focused on LGBTQIA issues. The Internet also allows LGBTQIA individuals to maintain anonymity. Lack of access to the internet can hinder these things, due to lack of broadband access in remote rural areas. LGBT Tech has emphasized launching newer technologies with 5G technology in order to help close the digital divide that can cause members of the LGBTQIA community to lose access to reliable and fast technology that can provide information on healthcare, economic opportunities, and safe communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lgbttech.org/post/the-potential-of-5g-to-reduce-the-digital-divide|title=The potential of 5G to reduce the digital divide|first=Carlos |last=Gutierrez|date=2020-01-27|website=lgbttech|language=en|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\n===Age gap===\n\nOlder adults, those ages 60 and up, face various barriers that contribute to their lack of access to information and communication technologies (ICTs). Many adults are \"[[Digital Immigrants|digital immigrants]]\" who have not had lifelong exposure to digital media and have had to adapt to incorporating it in their lives.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vidal|first=Elizabeth|date=October 2019|title=Digital Literacy Program: Reducing the Digital Gap of the Elderly: Experiences and Lessons Learned|journal=2019 International Conference on Inclusive Technologies and Education (CONTIE)|location=San Jose del Cabo, Mexico|publisher=IEEE|pages=117\u20131173|doi=10.1109/CONTIE49246.2019.00030|isbn=978-1-7281-5436-7}}</ref> A study in 2005 found that only 26% of people aged 65 and over were Internet users, compared to 67% in the 50-64 age group and 80% in the 30-49 year age group.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Czaja|first=Sara|last2=Schulz|first2=Richard|date=2006|title=Innovations in Technology and Aging Introduction|url=|journal=Generations: Journal of the American Society on Aging.|volume=30|issue=2|pages=6\u20138|via=}}</ref> This \"grey divide\" can be due to factors such as concern over security, motivation and self-efficacy, decline of memory or spatial orientation, cost, or lack of support.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Friemel|first=Thomas N|date=February 2016|title=The digital divide has grown old: Determinants of a digital divide among seniors|journal=New Media & Society|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=313\u2013331|doi=10.1177/1461444814538648|issn=1461-4448}}</ref> The aforementioned variables of race, disability, gender, and sexual orientation also add to the barriers for older adults.\n\nMany older adults may have physical or mental disabilities that render them homebound and financially insecure. They may be unable to afford internet access or lack transportation to use computers in public spaces, the benefits of which would be enhancing their health and reducing their social isolation and depression. Homebound older adults would benefit from internet use by using it to access health information, use telehealth resources, shop and bank online, and stay connected with friends or family using email or social networks.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Choi|first=Namkee G|last2=DiNitto|first2=Diana M|date=2013-05-02|title=The Digital Divide Among Low-Income Homebound Older Adults: Internet Use Patterns, eHealth Literacy, and Attitudes Toward Computer/Internet Use|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|language=en|volume=15|issue=5|pages=e93|doi=10.2196/jmir.2645|pmc=3650931|pmid=23639979}}</ref>\n\nThose in more privileged socio-economic positions and with a higher level of education are more likely to have internet access than those older adults living in poverty. Lack of access to the internet inhibits \"capital-enhancing activities\" such as accessing government assistance, job opportunities, or investments. The results of the U.S. Federal Communication Commission's 2009 National Consumer Broadband Service Capability Survey shows that older women are less likely to use the internet, especially for capital enhancing activities, than their male counterparts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hargittai|first=Eszter|last2=Dobransky|first2=Kerry|date=2017-05-23|title=Old Dogs, New Clicks: Digital Inequality in Skills and Uses among Older Adults|url=http://www.cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/view/3176|journal=Canadian Journal of Communication|volume=42|issue=2|doi=10.22230/cjc.2017v42n2a3176|issn=1499-6642|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==Facebook divide==\nThe [[Facebook divide]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yung|first=Chunsing|date=June 1, 2017|title=From Digital Divide to Facebook Divide, Reconstruct our Target Market Segments with Facebook Native and Facebook Immigrant|journal=Jaipuria International Journal of Management Research|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=8\u201318|doi=10.22552/jijmr/2017/v3/i1/146083|issn=2454-9509}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.bloomsbury.com/in/management-practices-for-the-new-economy-9789386432087/|title=Management Practices for the New Economy|last=Thakur|first=Rajiv|last2=Srivastava|first2=Vinita|last3=Bhatia|first3=Shikha|last4=Sharma|first4=Jitender|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing India Pvt.

The Facebook Divide, Facebook native, Facebook immigrants, and Facebook left-behind are concepts for social and business management research. Facebook Immigrants are utilizing Facebook for their accumulation of both bonding and bridging social capital. These Facebook Native, Facebook Immigrants, and Facebook left-behind induced the situation of Facebook inequality. In February 2018, the Facebook Divide Index was introduced at the ICMAPRANE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jaipuria.ac.in/icmaprane2018/icmaprane-2018/ |title=ICMAPRANE 2018 |work=Jaipuria.ac.in |date=June 20, 2014 |accessdate=2018-10-26}}</ref> conference in Noida, India, to illustrate the Facebook Divide phenomenon.\n\n==Overcoming the divide==\n\nAn individual must be able to connect in order to achieve enhancement of social and [[cultural capital]] as well as achieve mass economic gains in productivity.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}  Therefore, access is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for overcoming the digital divide. Access to ICT meets significant challenges that stem from income restrictions. The borderline between ICT as a [[necessity good]] and ICT as a [[luxury good]] is roughly around the \"magical number\" of US$10 per person per month, or US$120 per year,<ref name=\"HilbertWD38,5\">{{Cite journal| last1 = Hilbert | first1 = Martin| title = When is Cheap, Cheap Enough to Bridge the Digital Divide? Modeling Income Related Structural Challenges of Technology Diffusion in Latin America| doi = 10.1016/j.worlddev.2009.11.019| journal = World Development| volume = 38| issue = 5| pages = 756\u2013770| year = 2010| url = http://martinhilbert.net/CheapEnoughWD_Hilbert_pre-print.pdf}}</ref> which means that people consider ICT expenditure of US$120 per year as a basic necessity. Since more than 40% of the world population lives on less than US$2 per day, and around 20% live on less than US$1 per day (or less than US$365 per year), these income segments would have to spend one third of their income on ICT (120/365 = 33%). The global average of ICT spending is at a mere 3% of income.<ref name=\"HilbertWD38,5\"/> Potential solutions include driving down the costs of ICT, which includes low-cost technologies and shared access through [[Telecentre]]s.\n\nFurthermore, even though individuals might be capable of accessing the Internet, many are thwarted by barriers to entry, such as a lack of means to infrastructure or the inability to comprehend the information that the Internet provides. Lack of adequate infrastructure and lack of knowledge are two major obstacles that impede mass connectivity. These barriers limit individuals' capabilities in what they can do and what they can achieve in accessing technology. Some individuals can connect, but they do not have the knowledge to use what information ICTs and Internet technologies provide them. This leads to a focus on capabilities and skills, as well as awareness to move from mere access to effective usage of ICT.<ref name=\":2\">Karen Mossberger (2003). Virtual Inequality: Beyond the Digital Divide. Georgetown University Press</ref>\n\nThe [[United Nations]] is aiming to raise awareness of the divide by way of the [[World Information Society Day]] which has taken place yearly since May 17, 2006.<ref>[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/news-and-in-focus-articles/in-focus-articles/ United Nations Educational] UNDay</ref> It also set up the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Task Force in November 2001.<ref>[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2001/dev2353.doc.htm \"UN Information and Communication Technologies (ITC) Task Force Launched Today at Headquarters\"], Press Release, United Nations (New York), November 20, 2001</ref> Later [[UN]] initiatives in this area are the [[World Summit on the Information Society]], which was set up in 2003, and the [[Internet Governance Forum]], set up in 2006.\n\nIn the year 2000, the [[United Nations Volunteers]] (UNV) programme launched its Online Volunteering service,<ref>[https://onlinevolunteering.org Online Volunteering]</ref> which uses ICT as a vehicle for and in support of volunteering. It constitutes an example of a volunteering initiative that effectively contributes to bridge the digital divide. ICT-enabled volunteering has a clear added value for development. If more people collaborate online with more development institutions and initiatives, this will imply an increase in person-hours dedicated to development cooperation at essentially no additional cost. This is the most visible effect of online volunteering for human development.<ref>Acevedo, Manuel. 2005.

The former describes phenomena such as the divided users' demographics that make up sites such as Facebook and Myspace or Word Press and Tumblr. Each of these sites hosts thriving communities that engage with otherwise [[marginalized]] populations. An example of this is the large online community devoted to Afrofuturism, a discourse that critiques dominant structures of power by merging themes of science fiction and blackness. Social media brings together minds that may not otherwise meet, allowing for the free exchange of ideas and empowerment of marginalized discourses.\n\n=== Libraries ===\n[[File:13394-Laptops Anytime Launch-6629 (10844113484).jpg|thumb|A laptop lending kiosk at [[Texas A&M University\u2013Commerce]]'s Gee Library]]\n\nAttempts to bridge the digital divide include a program developed in Durban, South Africa, where deficient access to technology and a lack of documented cultural heritage has motivated the creation of an \"online indigenous digital library as part of public library services.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Greyling | first1 = E. | last2 = Zulu | first2 = S. | year = 2010 | title = Content development in an indigenous digital library: A case study in community participation | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b4190d9002582db2c23292cf7828d9ca3d273016| journal = IFLA Journal | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 30\u20139 | doi = 10.1177/0340035209359570 }}</ref> This project has the potential to narrow the digital divide by not only giving the people of the Durban area access to this digital resource, but also by incorporating the community members into the process of creating it.\n\nTo address the divide [[The Gates Foundation]] started the Gates Library Initiative which provides training  assistance and guidance in libraries.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal | last1 = Blau | first1 = A | year = 2002 | title = Access isn't enough: Merely connecting people and computers won't close the digital divide | url = | journal = American Libraries | volume = 33 | issue = 6| pages = 50\u201352 }}</ref>\n\nIn nations where poverty compounds effects of the digital divide, programs are emerging to counter those trends.  In Kenya, lack of funding, language, and technology illiteracy contributed to an overall lack of computer skills and educational advancement. This slowly began to change when foreign investment began.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} In the early 2000s, the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]] funded a revitalization project through the [[Kenya National Library Service]].  Those resources enabled public libraries to provide information and communication technologies to their patrons.  In 2012, public libraries in the [[Busia County|Busia]] and [[Kiberia]] communities introduced technology resources to supplement curriculum for primary schools.

CI is concerned with ensuring the opportunity not only for ICT access at the community level but also, according to [[Michael Gurstein]], that the means for the \"effective use\" of ICTs for community betterment and empowerment are available.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gurstein|first=Michael|title=Effective use: A community informatics strategy beyond the digital divide|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/1107/1027|accessdate=June 12, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309051347/http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/1107/1027|archive-date=March 9, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Gurstein has also extended the discussion of the digital divide to include issues around access to and the use of \"open data\" and coined the term \"data divide\" to refer to this issue area.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gurstein|first=Michael|title=Open data: Empowering the empowered or effective data use for everyone?|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/3316/2764|accessdate=June 12, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124005256/http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/3316/2764|archive-date=November 24, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Implications==\n\n===Social capital===\nOnce an individual is connected, Internet connectivity and ICTs can enhance his or her future social and cultural capital. [[Social capital]] is acquired through repeated interactions with other individuals or groups of individuals. Connecting to the Internet creates another set of means by which to achieve repeated interactions. ICTs and Internet connectivity enable repeated interactions through access to social networks, chat rooms, and gaming sites. Once an individual has access to connectivity, obtains infrastructure by which to connect, and can understand and use the information that ICTs and connectivity provide, that individual is capable of becoming a \"digital citizen.\" <ref name=\"MossbergerRacePlace\"/>\n\n=== Economic disparity ===\nIn the United States, the research provided by Sungard Availability Services notes a direct correlation between a company's access to technological advancements and its overall success in bolstering the economy.<ref name=\"Forbes1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2016/07/16/lack-of-digital-cloud-opportunities-is-actually-embarrassing-for-employees-survey-suggests/|title=Lack Of Digital, Cloud Opportunities Is Actually Embarrassing For Employees, Survey Suggests|last=McKendrick|first=Joe|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-04-17}}</ref>&nbsp;The study, which includes over 2,000 IT executives and staff officers, indicates that 69 percent of employees feel they do not have access to sufficient technology in order to make their jobs easier, while 63 percent of them believe the lack of technological mechanisms hinders their ability to develop new work skills.<ref name=Forbes1/>&nbsp;Additional analysis provides more evidence to show how the digital divide also affects the economy in places all over the world.

[[Web 2.0]] technologies like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Blogs enable users to participate online and create content without having to understand how the technology actually works, leading to an ever-increasing digital divide between those who have the skills and understanding to interact more fully with the technology and those who are passive consumers of it.<ref name=\"Reilley\" /> Many are only nominal content creators through the use of Web 2.0, posting photos and status updates on Facebook, but not truly interacting with the technology.\n\nSome of the reasons for this production gap include material factors like the type of Internet connection one has and the frequency of access to the Internet. The more frequently a person has access to the Internet and the faster the connection, the more opportunities they have to gain the technology skills and the more time they have to be creative.<ref name=\"Schradie\">{{cite journal | last1 = Schradie | first1 = Jen | year = 2011 | title = The Digital Production Gap: The Digital Divide and Web 2.0 Collide | url = http://sociology.berkeley.edu/documents/newspage_docs/J.%20Schradie%20-%20The%20Digital%20Production%20Gap%20for%20Web%20Post%20Poetics.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120227005023/http://sociology.berkeley.edu/documents/newspage_docs/J.%20Schradie%20-%20The%20Digital%20Production%20Gap%20for%20Web%20Post%20Poetics.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2012-02-27 | journal = Poetics | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 145\u2013168 | doi = 10.1016/j.poetic.2011.02.003 }}</ref>\n\nOther reasons include cultural factors often associated with class and socioeconomic status.

The term \"digital divide\" does not necessarily mean that someone does not have technology; it could mean that there is simply a difference in technology.  These differences can refer to, for example, high-quality computers, fast Internet, technical assistance, or telephone services. The difference between all of these is also considered a gap.\n\nThere is a large inequality worldwide in terms of the distribution of installed telecommunication bandwidth. In 2014 only three countries (China, US, Japan) host 50% of the globally installed bandwidth potential (see pie-chart Figure on the right).<ref name=\"HilbertBitsDivide\"/> This concentration is not new, as historically only ten countries have hosted 70\u201375% of the global telecommunication capacity (see Figure). The U.S. lost its global leadership in terms of installed bandwidth in 2011, being replaced by China, which hosts more than twice as much national bandwidth potential in 2014 (29% versus 13% of the global total).<ref name=\"HilbertBitsDivide\"/>\n\n===Versus the digital divide===\nThe global digital divide is a special case of the digital divide; the focus is set on the fact that \"Internet has developed unevenly throughout the world\"<ref name=Guillen-2005/>{{rp|681}} causing some countries to fall behind in technology, education, labor, democracy, and tourism.  The concept of the digital divide was originally popularized regarding the disparity in Internet access between rural and urban areas of the United States of America; the ''global'' digital divide mirrors this disparity on an international scale.\n\nThe global digital divide also contributes to the inequality of access to goods and services available through technology.  Computers and the Internet provide users with improved education, which can lead to higher wages; the people living in nations with limited access are therefore disadvantaged.<ref>Krueger 1993; Attewell and Battle 1999.</ref> This global divide is often characterized as falling along what is sometimes called the [[North\u2013South divide]] of \"northern\" wealthier nations and \"southern\" poorer ones.\n\n===Obstacles to a solution===\nSome people argue that necessities need to be considered before achieving digital inclusion, such as an ample food supply and quality health care.  Minimizing the global digital divide requires considering and addressing the following types of access:\n\n====Physical access====\nInvolves \"the distribution of ICT devices per capita\u2026and land lines per thousands\".<ref name=Wilson-2004/>{{rp|306}}  Individuals need to obtain access to computers, landlines, and networks in order to access the Internet. This access barrier is also addressed in Article 21 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by the United Nations.\n\n====Financial access====\nThe cost of ICT devices, traffic, applications, technician and educator training, software, maintenance, and infrastructures require ongoing financial means.<ref name=\"HilbertWD38,5\" />\nFinancial access and \"the levels of household income play a significant role in widening the gap\" <ref>\u201cDigital Divide.\u201d The Digital Divide, Stanford University, cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs201/projects/digital-divide/start.html. Retrieved September 19, 2017.</ref>\n\n====Socio-demographic access====\nEmpirical tests have identified that several socio-demographic characteristics foster or limit ICT access and usage. Among different countries, educational levels and income are the most powerful explanatory variables, with age being a third one.<ref name=\"HilbertDigDiv2011\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Hilbert | first1 = Martin| title = The end justifies the definition: The manifold outlooks on the digital divide and their practical usefulness for policy-making | doi = 10.1016/j.telpol.2011.06.012 | journal = Telecommunications Policy | volume = 35 | issue = 8 | pages = 715\u2013736| year = 2011 | url = http://martinhilbert.net/ManifoldDigitalDivide_Hilbert_AAM.pdf}}</ref><ref name=\"HilbertWD38,5\"/>\n\nWhile a Global Gender Gap in access and usage of ICT's exist, empirical evidence shows that this is due to unfavorable conditions concerning employment, education and income and not to technophobia or lower ability. In the contexts understudy, women with the prerequisites for access and usage turned out to be more active users of digital tools than men.<ref name=HilbertGend2011 />  In the US, for example, the figures for 2018 show 89% of men and 88% of women use the Internet.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/184415/percentage-of-us-adults-who-are-internet-users-by-gender/ |title = U.S. Internet penetration by gender 2000-2018}}</ref>\n\n====Cognitive access====\nIn order to use computer technology, a certain level of information literacy is needed.   Further challenges include information overload and the ability to find and use reliable information.\n\n====Design access====\nComputers need to be accessible to individuals with different learning and physical abilities including complying with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 in the United States.<ref>[http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=Laws Section 508] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806075749/http://section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=Laws |date=August 6, 2013 }} (1998). United States Government.</ref>\n\n====Institutional access====\nIn illustrating institutional access, Wilson states \"the numbers of users are greatly affected by whether access is offered only through individual homes or whether it is offered through schools, community centers, religious institutions, cybercaf\u00e9s, or post offices, especially in poor countries where computer access at work or home is highly limited\".<ref name=Wilson-2004/>{{rp|303}}\n\n====Political access====\nGuillen & Suarez argue that \"democratic political regimes enable faster growth of the Internet than authoritarian or totalitarian regimes.\" <ref name=Guillen-2005/>{{rp|687}}  The Internet is considered a form of e-democracy, and attempting to control what citizens can or cannot view is in contradiction to this.

Retrieved April 13, 2014, from http://www.internetworldstats.com/links10.htm</ref>\n\n*Economic equality \u2013 For example, the telephone is often seen as one of the most important components, because having access to a working telephone can lead to higher safety. If there were to be an emergency, one could easily call for help if one could use a nearby phone. In another example, many work-related tasks are online, and people without access to the Internet may not be able to complete work up to company standards. The Internet is regarded by some as a basic component of civic life that developed countries ought to guarantee for their citizens. Additionally, welfare services, for example, are sometimes offered via the Internet.<ref name=\"internetworldstats.com\"/>\n*Social mobility \u2013 Computer and Internet use is regarded as being very important to development and success. However, some children are not getting as much technical education as others, because lower socioeconomic areas cannot afford to provide schools with computer facilities. For this reason, some kids are being separated and not receiving the same chance as others to be successful.<ref name=\"internetworldstats.com\"/>\n*Democracy \u2013 Some people believe that eliminating the digital divide would help countries become healthier democracies. They argue that communities would become much more involved in events such as elections or decision making.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00418|title=Inclusion of excluded groups in decision-making in the development of technologies|website=Social Impact Open Repository (SIOR)|date=2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905142527/http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00418|archive-date=September 5, 2017|url-status=dead|access-date=September 5, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"internetworldstats.com\"/>\n*Economic growth \u2013 It is believed that less-developed nations could gain quick access to economic growth if the information infrastructure were to be developed and well used. By improving the latest technologies, certain countries and industries can gain a competitive advantage.<ref name=\"internetworldstats.com\"/>\n\nWhile these four arguments are meant to lead to a solution to the digital divide, there are a couple of other components that need to be considered. The first one is rural living versus suburban living. Rural areas used to have very minimal access to the Internet, for example. However, nowadays, power lines and satellites are used to increase the availability in these areas. Another component to keep in mind is disabilities. Some people may have the highest quality technologies, but a disability they have may keep them from using these technologies to their fullest extent.<ref name=\"internetworldstats.com\"/>\n\nUsing previous studies (Gamos, 2003; Nsengiyuma & Stork, 2005; Harwit, 2004 as cited in James), James asserts that in developing countries, \"internet use has taken place overwhelmingly among the upper-income, educated, and urban segments\" largely due to the high literacy rates of this sector of the population.<ref name=James-2008>{{cite journal | last1 = James | first1 = J | year = 2008 | title = Digital Divide Complacency: Misconceptions and Dangers | journal = The Information Society | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 54\u201361 | doi = 10.1080/01972240701774790 }}</ref>{{rp|58}} As such, James suggests that part of the solution requires that developing countries first build up the literacy/language skills, [[computer literacy]], and technical competence that low-income and rural populations need in order to make use of ICT.\n\nIt has also been suggested that there is a correlation between democrat regimes and the growth of the Internet. One hypothesis by Gullen is, \"The more democratic the polity, the greater the Internet use...The government can try to control the Internet by monopolizing control\" and Norris ''et al.'' also contends, \"If there is less government control of it, the Internet flourishes, and it is associated with greater democracy and civil liberties.<ref name=PickAndAzari-2008>{{cite journal | last1 = Pick | first1 = J. | last2 = Azari | first2 = R. | year = 2008 | title = Global Digital Divide: Influence of Socioeconomic, Governmental, and Accessibility Factors on Information Technology | url = | journal = Information Technology for Development | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 91\u2013115 | doi=10.1002/itdj.20095}}</ref>\n\nFrom an economic perspective, Pick and Azari state that \"in developing nations\u2026foreign direct investment (FDI), primary education, educational investment, access to education, and government prioritization of ICT as all-important\".<ref name=PickAndAzari-2008/>{{rp|112}} Specific solutions proposed by the study include: \"invest in stimulating, attracting, and growing creative technical and scientific workforce; increase the access to education and digital literacy; reduce the gender divide and empower women to participate in the ICT workforce; emphasize investing in intensive Research and Development for selected metropolitan areas and regions within nations\".<ref name=PickAndAzari-2008/>{{rp|111}}\n\nThere are projects worldwide that have implemented, to various degrees, the solutions outlined above.  Many such projects have taken the form of Information Communications Technology Centers (ICT centers).  Rahnman explains that \"the main role of ICT intermediaries is defined as an organization providing effective support to local communities in the use and adaptation of technology.  Most commonly, an ICT intermediary will be a specialized organization from outside the community, such as a non-governmental organization, local government, or international donor. On the other hand, a social intermediary is defined as a local institution from within the community, such as a community-based organization.<ref>Rahman, H. (2006). ''Empowering Marginal Communities and Information Networking''. Hershey, Pennsylvania: Idea Group Publishing.</ref>{{rp|128}}\n\nOther proposed solutions that the Internet promises for developing countries are the provision of efficient communications within and among developing countries so that citizens worldwide can effectively help each other to solve their problems. Grameen Banks and Kiva loans are two microcredit systems designed to help citizens worldwide to contribute online towards entrepreneurship in developing communities. Economic opportunities range from entrepreneurs who can afford the hardware and broadband access required to maintain Internet caf\u00e9s to agribusinesses having control over the seeds they plant.\n\nAt the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], the IMARA organization (from [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word for \"power\") sponsors a variety of outreach programs which bridge the Global Digital Divide. Its aim is to find and implement long-term, sustainable solutions which will increase the availability of educational technology and resources to domestic and international communities. These projects are run under the aegis of the [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]] (CSAIL) and staffed by MIT volunteers who give training, install and donate computer setups in greater [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Kenya]], Indian reservations the American Southwest such as the [[Navajo Nation]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]]. The CommuniTech project strives to empower underserved communities through sustainable technology and education.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Fizz|first1=Robyn|last2=Mansur|first2=Karla|title=Helping MIT neighbors cross the 'digital divide'|newspaper=MIT Tech Talk|date=June 4, 2008|publisher=Cambridge: MIT|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2008/techtalk52-28.pdf|page=3}}</ref><ref>[http://imara.csail.mit.edu/ IMARA Project at MIT]</ref><ref>Fizz, Robyn, [http://ist.mit.edu/news/communitech \"CommuniTech Works Locally to Bridge the Digital Divide\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818173543/http://ist.mit.edu/news/communitech |date=August 18, 2011 }}, ''IST News'', MIT, April 8, 2011</ref> According to Dominik Hartmann of the MIT's Media Lab, interdisciplinary approaches are needed to bridge the global digital divide.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Hartmann|first1=Dominik|title=Building bridges|newspaper=D+C, development&cooperation|date=March 25, 2016|url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/innovative-interdisciplinary-approaches-needed-tackle-digital-divide-and-growing-inequality}}</ref>\n\nBuilding on the premise that any effective solution must be decentralized, allowing the local communities in developing nations to generate their content, one scholar has posited that social media\u2014like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter\u2014may be useful tools in closing the divide.<ref name=\"AliHRJ\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ali | first1 = Amir | year = 2011 | title = The Power of Social Media in Developing Nations: New Tools for Closing the Global Digital Divide and Beyond | url = http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/185-220.pdf | journal = Harvard Human Rights Journal | volume = 24 | issue =  | page = 1 | access-date = March 30, 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121114083745/http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/185-220.pdf | archive-date = November 14, 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref> As Amir Hatem Ali suggests, \"the popularity and generative nature of social media empower individuals to combat some of the main obstacles to bridging the digital divide\".<ref name=\"AliHRJ\"/>{{rp|188}} Facebook's statistics reinforce this claim.

Amongst them, are its ability to offer a means of interacting with others, user-friendly features, and the fact that most sites are available at no cost.<ref name=\"AliHRJ\"/> The problem with social media, however, is that it can be accessible, provided that there is physical access.<ref name=\"AliHRJ\"/> Nevertheless, with its ability to encourage digital inclusion, social media can be used as a tool to bridge the global digital divide.<ref name=\"AliHRJ\"/>\n\nSome cities in the world have started programs to bridge the digital divide for their residents, school children, students, parents and the elderly. One such program, founded in 1996, was sponsored by the city of Boston and called the Boston Digital Bridge Foundation.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20021008225433/http://www.digitalbridgefoundation.org/ (Boston) Digital Bridge Foundation]</ref> It especially concentrates on school children and their parents, helping to make both equally and similarly knowledgeable about computers, using application programs, and navigating the Internet.<ref>[http://www.cityofboston.gov/news/Default.aspx?id=1479 \"Mayor Menino, Boston Digital Bridge Foundation Host Evening on the Bridge 2.0 Celebration\"], Mayor's Office, Boston, Press Release, September 26, 2002</ref><ref>[http://www.cityofboston.gov/news/default.aspx?id=4765 \"City of Boston Receives $4.3 Million Grant That Will Give Training, Computers and Opportunity to Underserved Communities\"], City of Boston press office, September 14, 2010</ref>\n\n===Free Basics===\n{{Main|Free Basics}}\n\nFree Basics is a partnership between social networking services company Facebook and six companies (Samsung, Ericsson, MediaTek, Opera Software, Nokia and Qualcomm) that plans to bring affordable access to selected Internet services to less developed countries by increasing efficiency, and facilitating the development of new business models around the provision of Internet access. In the whitepaper<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scontent-cdg2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/12057105_1001874746531417_622371037_n.pdf?oh=4a6afa24c125a3debe1784bcacefa8b4&oe=5B03C427|title=Is connectivity a human right?|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}{{Dead link|date=January 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> realised by Facebook's founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, connectivity is asserted as a \"human right\", and Internet.org is created to improve Internet access for people around the world.\n\n\"Free Basics provides people with access to useful services on their mobile phones in markets where internet access may be less affordable. The websites are available for free without data charges, and include content about news, employment, health, education and local information etc. By introducing people to the benefits of the internet through these websites, we hope to bring more people online and help improve their lives.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://info.internet.org/en/|title=Internet.org:About|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Free Basics is also accused of violating [[net neutrality]] for limiting access to handpicked services. Despite a wide deployment in numerous countries, it has been met with heavy resistance notably in India where the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India eventually banned it in 2016.\n\n===Satellite constellations===\n\nSeveral projects to bring internet to the entire world with a [[satellite constellation]] have been devised in the last decade, one of these being [[Starlink (satellite constellation)|Starlink]] by [[Elon Musk]]'s company [[SpaceX]]. Unlike Free Basics, it would provide people with a full internet access and would not be limited to a few selected services. In the same week Starlink was announced, serial-entrepreneur Richard Branson announced his own project [[OneWeb satellite constellation|OneWeb]], a similar constellation with approximately 700 satellites that has already procured communication frequency licenses for their broadcast spectrum and could possibly be operational as early as in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-satellite-entrepreneurs-20150117-story.html|title=Elon Musk and Richard Branson invest in satellite-Internet ventures|last=|first=|date=January 17, 2015|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe biggest hurdle to these projects is the astronomical, financial, and logistical cost of launching so many satellites. After the failure of previous satellite-to-consumer space ventures, satellite industry consultant Roger Rusch said \"It's highly unlikely that you can make a successful business out of this.\" Musk has publicly acknowledged this business reality, and indicated in mid-2015 that while endeavoring to develop this technically-complicated space-based communication system he wants to avoid overextending the company and stated that they are being measured in the pace of development.\n\n===One Laptop per Child===\n\n[[One Laptop per Child]] (OLPC) is another attempt to narrow the digital divide.<ref name=\"wiki.laptop.org\">[http://one.laptop.org/about/mission One Laptop Per Child]. (2009).</ref> This organization, founded in 2005, provides inexpensively produced \"XO\" laptops (dubbed the \"$100 laptop\", though actual production costs vary) to children residing in poor and isolated regions within developing countries. Each laptop belongs to an individual child and provides a gateway to digital learning and Internet access. The XO laptops are designed to withstand more abuse than higher-end machines, and they contain features in context to the unique conditions that remote villages present. Each laptop is constructed to use as little power as possible, have a sunlight-readable screen, and is capable of automatically networking with other XO laptops in order to access the Internet\u2014as many as 500 machines can share a single point of access.<ref name=\"wiki.laptop.org\"/>\n\n==World Summit on the Information Society==\n{{Main |World Summit on the Information Society}}\n\nSeveral of the 67 principles adopted at the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] convened by the [[United Nations]] in Geneva in 2003 directly address the digital divide:<ref name=WSIS-03>[http://www.itu.int/wsis/docs/geneva/official/dop.html \"Declaration of Principles\"], WSIS-03/GENEVA/DOC/4-E, World Summit on the Information Society, Geneva, December 12, 2003</ref>\n:10. We are also fully aware that the benefits of the information technology revolution are today unevenly distributed between the developed and developing countries and within societies. We are fully committed to turning this digital divide into a digital opportunity for all, particularly for those who risk being left behind and being further marginalized.\n:11. We are committed to realizing our common vision of the Information Society for ourselves and for future generations. We recognize that young people are the future workforce and leading creators and earliest adopters of ICTs. They must therefore be empowered as learners, developers, contributors, entrepreneurs and decision-makers. We must focus especially on young people who have not yet been able to benefit fully from the opportunities provided by ICTs. We are also committed to ensuring that the development of ICT applications and operation of services respects the rights of children as well as their protection and well-being.\n:12. We affirm that development of ICTs provides enormous opportunities for women, who should be an integral part of, and key actors, in the Information Society. We are committed to ensuring that the Information Society enables women's empowerment and their full participation on the basis on equality in all spheres of society and in all decision-making processes. To this end, we should mainstream a gender equality perspective and use ICTs as a tool to that end.\n:13. In building the Information Society, we shall pay particular attention to the special needs of marginalized and vulnerable groups of society, including migrants, internally displaced persons and refugees, unemployed and underprivileged people, minorities and nomadic people. We shall also recognize the special needs of older persons and persons with disabilities.\n:14. We are resolute to empower the poor, particularly those living in remote, rural and marginalized urban areas, to access information and to use ICTs as a tool to support their efforts to lift themselves out of poverty.\n:15. In the evolution of the Information Society, particular attention must be given to the special situation of indigenous peoples, as well as to the preservation of their heritage and their cultural legacy.\n:16. We continue to pay special attention to the particular needs of people of developing countries, countries with economies in transition, Least Developed Countries, Small Island Developing States, Landlocked Developing Countries, Highly Indebted Poor Countries, countries and territories under occupation, countries recovering from conflict and countries and regions with special needs as well as to conditions that pose severe threats to development, such as natural disasters.\n:21. Connectivity is a central enabling agent in building the Information Society. Universal, ubiquitous, equitable and affordable access to ICT infrastructure and services, constitutes one of the challenges of the Information Society and should be an objective of all stakeholders involved in building it. Connectivity also involves access to energy and postal services, which should be assured in conformity with the domestic legislation of each country.\n:28. We strive to promote universal access with equal opportunities for all to scientific knowledge and the creation and dissemination of scientific and technical information, including open access initiatives for scientific publishing.\n:46. In building the Information Society, States are strongly urged to take steps with a view to the avoidance of, and refrain from, any unilateral measure not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations that impedes the full achievement of economic and social development by the population of the affected countries, and that hinders the well-being of their population.\n\n==See also==\n{{Library resources box}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Achievement gap]]\n* [[Participation (decision making)#Civic opportunity gap|Civic opportunity gap]]\n* [[Computer technology for developing areas]]\n* [[Digital divide by country]]\n* [[Digital divide in Canada]]\n* [[Digital divide in China]]\n* [[Digital divide in South Africa]]\n* [[Digital divide in Thailand]]\n* [[Digital rights]]\n* [[Digital Society Day]] (October 17 in India)\n* [[Global Internet usage]]\n* [[Information society]]\n* [[International communication]]\n* [[Internet Geography|Internet geography]]\n* [[Internet governance]]\n* [[List of countries by Internet connection speeds]]\n* [[National broadband plans from around the world]]\n* [[NetDay]]\n* [[Rural Internet]]\n\n===Groups devoted to digital divide issues===\n* [[Center for Digital Inclusion]]\n* [[Digital Textbook]] a [[South Korea]]n Project that intends to distribute tablet notebooks to elementary school students.\n* [[Inveneo]]\n* [[TechChange]]\n* [[United Nations Information and Communication Technologies Task Force]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = I'd blush if I could: closing gender divides in digital skills through education\n| author = UNESCO, EQUALS Skills Coalition\n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = \n| source = UNESCO\n| documentURL = https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000367416\n| license statement URL = \n| license = CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO\n}}\n\n== References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Azam, M.

This includes 5 elements: 1) affordable, robust broadband internet service; 2) internet-enabled devices that meet the needs of the user; 3) access to digital literacy training; 4) quality technical support; 5) applications and online content designed to enable and encourage self-sufficiency, participation and collaboration.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalinclusion.org/definitions/|title=NDIA|year=2017|accessdate=June 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSome people{{who|date=July 2019}} are concerned that people without access to the [[internet]] and other information and communication technologies will be disadvantaged, as they are unable or less able to [[Online shopping|shop online]], search for information online, or learn skills needed for [[High tech|technical jobs]]. This results in programs to give computers and related services to people without access.

As shown by the Figure, during the mid-2000s, communication capacity was more unequally distributed than during the late 1980s, when only fixed-line phones existed. The most recent increase in digital equality stems from the massive diffusion of the latest digital innovations (i.e. fixed and mobile broadband infrastructures, e.g. [[3G]] and fiber optics [[FTTH]]).<ref>SciDevNet (2014) How mobile phones increased the digital divide; http://www.scidev.net/global/data/scidev-net-at-large/how-mobile-phones-increased-the-digital-divide.html</ref>\nMeasurement methodologies of the digital divide, and more specifically an Integrated Iterative Approach General Framework (Integrated Contextual Iterative Approach \u2013 ICI) and the digital divide modeling theory under measurement model DDG (Digital Divide Gap) are  used to analyze the gap existing between developed and developing countries, and the gap among the 27 members-states of the European Union.<ref>Abdalhakim, Hawaf., (2009).

In 2001, fixed-line telecommunication penetration reached 70% of society in developed [[OECD]] countries and 10% of the developing world. This resulted in a ratio of 7 to 1 (divide in relative terms) or a difference of 60% (divide in measured in absolute terms). During the next decade, fixed-line penetration stayed almost constant in OECD countries (at 70%), while the rest of the world started a catch-up, closing the divide to a ratio of 3.5 to 1. The lower graph shows the divide not in terms of ICT devices, but in terms of kbit/s per inhabitant. While the average member of developed countries counted with 29 kbit/s more than a person in developing countries in 2001, this difference got multiplied by a factor of one thousand (to a difference of 2900 kbit/s). In relative terms, the fixed-line capacity divide was even worse during the introduction of broadband Internet at the middle of the first decade of the 2000s, when the OECD counted with 20 times more capacity per capita than the rest of the world.<ref name=\"HilbertInfoInequality\" /> This shows the importance of measuring the divide in terms of kbit/s, and not merely to count devices. The International Telecommunications Union concludes that \"the bit becomes a unifying variable enabling comparisons and aggregations across different kinds of communication technologies\".<ref name=\"ITUmeasuring2012\">[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/publications/idi/material/2012/MIS2012_without_Annex_4.pdf \"Chapter 5: Measuring communication capacity in bits and bytes\"], in Measuring the report Information Society 2012; ITU (International Telecommunication Union) (2012).</ref>\n\n===Skills and digital literacy===\nHowever, research shows that the digital divide is more than just an access issue and cannot be alleviated merely by providing the necessary equipment.

New York: Neal-Schuman Publishers.</ref> Most commonly, a digital divide stems from poverty and the economic barriers that limit resources and prevent people from obtaining or otherwise using newer technologies.\n\nIn research, while each explanation is examined, others must be controlled in order to eliminate [[interaction effects]] or [[Mediation (statistics)|mediating variables]],<ref name=\"MossbergerRacePlace\">{{cite journal | last1 = Mossberger | first1 = Karen |author-link1=Karen Mossberger | last2 = Tolbert | first2 = Caroline J. ||author-link2=Caroline Tolbert | last3 = Gilbert | first3 = Michele | year = 2006 | title = Race, Place, and Information Technology (IT) | url = https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&context=ncdg| journal = Urban Affairs Review | volume = 41 | issue = 5| pages = 583\u2013620 | doi=10.1177/1078087405283511}}</ref> but these explanations are meant to stand as general trends, not direct causes. Each component can be looked at from different angles, which leads to a myriad of ways to look at (or define) the digital divide. For example, measurements for the intensity of usages, such as incidence and frequency, vary by study. Some report usage as access to Internet and ICTs while others report usage as having previously connected to the Internet. Some studies focus on specific technologies, others on a combination (such as [[Infostate]], proposed by [[Orbicom-UNESCO]], the [[Digital Opportunity Index]], or [[ITU]]'s [[ICT Development Index]]). Based on different answers to the questions of who, with which kinds of characteristics, connects how and why to what there are hundreds of alternatives ways to define the digital divide.<ref name=\"HilbertDigDiv2011\"/> \"The new consensus recognizes that the key question is not how to connect people to a specific network through a specific device, but how to extend the expected gains from new ICTs.\" <ref>Galperin, H.

The first of three reports is entitled \"Falling Through the Net: A Survey of the \u2018Have Nots\u2019 in Rural and Urban America\" (1995),<ref>National Telecommunications & Information Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce.

Retrieved from http://www.ntia.doc.gov/report/1998/falling-through-net-ii-new-data-digital-divide</ref> and the final report \"Falling Through the Net: Defining the Digital Divide\" (1999).<ref name=\"ntia.doc.gov\">National Telecommunications & Information Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce. (1999). Falling through the net: Defining the digital divide. Washington, D.C. Retrieved from http://www.ntia.doc.gov/report/1999/falling-through-net-defining-digital-divide</ref>  The NTIA's final report attempted clearly to define the term digital divide; \"the digital divide\u2014the divide between those with access to new technologies and those without\u2014is now one of America's leading economic and civil rights issues. This report will help clarify which Americans are falling further behind so that we can take concrete steps to redress this gap.\"<ref name=\"ntia.doc.gov\"/> Since the introduction of the NTIA reports, much of the early, relevant literature began to reference the NTIA's digital divide definition. The digital divide is commonly defined as being between the \"haves\" and \"have-nots.\"<ref name=\"ntia.doc.gov\"/><ref>National Telecommunications & Information Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce. (1995). Falling through the net: A survey of the\u2018have nots\u2019 in rural and urban America. Washington, D.C. Retrieved from http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/fallingthru.html</ref> The economic gap really comes into play when referring to the older generations.\n\n===Racial gap===\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2020}} \nAlthough many groups in society are affected by a lack of access to computers or the internet, communities of color are specifically observed to be negatively affected by the digital divide. This is evident when it comes to observing home-internet access among different races and ethnicities. 81% of Whites and 83% of Asians have home internet access, compared to 70% of Hispanics, 68% of Blacks, 72% of American Indian/Alaska Natives, and 68% of Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders. Although income is a factor in home-internet access disparities, there are still racial and ethnic inequalities that are present among those within lower income groups. 58% of low income Whites are reported to have home-internet access in comparison to 51% of Hispanics and 50% of Blacks. This information is reported in a report titled \u201cDigital Denied: The Impact of Systemic Racial Discrimination on Home-Internet Adoption\u201d which was published by the DC-based public interest group Fress Press. The report concludes that structural barriers and discrimination that perpetuates bias against people of different races and ethnicities contribute to having an impact on the digital divide. The report also concludes that those who do not have internet access still have a high demand for it, and reduction in the price of home-internet access would allow for an increase in equitable participation and improve internet adoption by marginalized groups.<ref>https://www.freepress.net/sites/default/files/legacy-policy/digital_denied_free_press_report_december_2016.pdf</ref>\n\nDigital censorship and algorithmic bias are observed to be present in the racial divide. Hate-speech rules as well as hate speech algorithms online platforms such as Facebook have favored white males and those belonging to elite groups in society over marginalized groups in society, such as women and people of color. In a collection of internal documents that were collected in a project conducted by ProPublica, Facebook's guidelines in regards to distinguishing hate speech and recognizing protected groups revealed slides that identified three groups, each one containing either female drivers, black children, or white men. When the question of which subset group is protected is presented, the correct answer was white men . Minority group language is negatively impacted by automated tools of hate detection due to human bias that ultimately decides what is considered hate speech and what is not.\n\nOnline platforms have also been observed to tolerate hateful content towards people of color but restrict content from people of color. Aboriginal memes on a Facebook page were posted with racially abusive content and comments depicting Aboriginal people as inferior. While the contents on the page were removed by the originators after an investigation conducted by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, Facebook did not delete the page and has allowed it to remain under the classification of controversial humor . However, a post by an African American woman addressing her uncomfortableness of being the only person of color in a small-town restaurant was met with racist and hateful messages. When reporting the online abuse to Facebook, her account was suspended by Facebook for three days for posting the screenshots while those responsible for the racist comments she received were not suspended. Shared experiences between people of color can be at risk of being silenced under removal policies for online platforms.\n\n===Disability gap===\nInequities in [[access to information]] technologies are present among individuals living with a disability in comparison to those who are not living with a disability. According to The Pew Research Center, 54% of households with a person who has a disability have home internet access compared to 81% of households that have home internet access and do not have a person who has a disability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2011/01/21/americans-living-with-disability-and-their-technology-profile/|title=Americans living with disability and their technology profile|last=NW|first=1615 L.

However, there is still a lack of access to technology and home internet access among those who have a cognitive and auditory disability as well. There is a concern of whether or not the increase in the use of information technologies will increase equality through offering opportunities for individuals living with disabilities or whether it will only add to the present inequalities and lead to individuals living with disabilities being left behind in society. Issues such as the perception of disabilities in society, Federal and state government policy, corporate policy, mainstream computing technologies, and real-time online communication have been found to contribute to the impact of the digital divide on individuals with disabilities .\n\nPeople with disabilities are also the targets of online abuse. Online disability hate crimes have increased by 33% across the UK between 2016\u201317 and 2017-18 according to a report published by [[Leonard Cheshire Disability|Leonard Cheshire]], a health and welfare charity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/10/online-hate-against-disabled-people-rises-by-a-third|title=Online hate crime against disabled people rises by a third|date=2019-05-10|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> Accounts of online hate abuse towards people with disabilities were shared during an incident in 2019 when model Katie Price's son was the target of online abuse that was attributed to him having a disability. In response to the abuse, a campaign was launched by Katie Price to ensure that Britain's MP's held those who are guilty of perpetuating online abuse towards those with disabilities accountable.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-politics-42964068/katie-price-calls-on-mps-to-make-online-abuse-criminal-offence|title='He can't speak to defend himself, I can'|website=BBC News|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> Online abuse towards individuals with disabilities is a factor that can discourage people from engaging online which could prevent people from learning information that could improve their lives. Many individuals living with disabilities face online abuse in the form of accusations of benefit fraud and \u201cfaking\u201d their disability for financial gain, which in some cases leads to unnecessary investigations.\n\n===Gender gap===\n{{Main|Gender digital divide}}\n\nA paper published by J. Cooper from Princeton University points out that learning technology is designed to be receptive to men instead of women. The reasoning for this is that most software engineers and programmers are men, and they communicate their learning software in a way that would match the reception of their recipient. The association of computers in education is normally correlated with the male gender, and this has an impact on the education of computers and technology among women, although it is important to mention that there are plenty of learning software that are designed to help women and girls learn technology. Overall, the study presents the problem of various perspectives in society that are a result of gendered socialization patterns that believe that computers are a part of the male experience since computers have traditionally presented as a toy for boys when they are children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.pcw.gov.ph/sites/default/files/digital%20divide%20special%20case%20of%20gender.pdf}}</ref> This divide is followed as children grow older and young girls are not encouraged as much to pursue degrees in IT and computer science. In 1990, the percentage of women in computing jobs was 36%, however in 2016, this number had fallen to 25%. This can be seen in the underrepresentation of women in IT hubs such as Silicon Valley (.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/04/why-is-silicon-valley-so-awful-to-women/517788/}}</ref>\n\nThere has also been the presence of algorithmic bias that has been shown in machine learning algorithms that are implemented by major companies.{{clarify |date=March 2020 |reason=\"Major companies\", plural, is claimed, but only a single company is mentioned and referenced.}} In 2015, Amazon had to abandon a recruiting algorithm that showed a difference between ratings that candidates received for software developer jobs as well as other technical jobs. As a result, it was revealed that Amazon's machine algorithm was biased against women and favored male resumes over female resumes. This was due to the fact that Amazon's computer models were trained to vet patterns in resumes over a 10-year period. During this ten-year period, the majority of the resumes belong to male individuals, which is a reflection of male dominance across the tech industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G}}</ref>\n\n===LGBTQIA gap===\nA number of states, including some that have introduced new laws since 2010, notably censor voices from and content related to the LGBTQI community, posing serious consequences to access to information about sexual orientation and gender identity. Digital platforms play a powerful role in limiting access to certain content, such as YouTube's 2017 decision to classify non-explicit videos with LGBTQIA themes as \u2018restricted\u2019, a classification designed to filter out \u2018potentially inappropriate content\u2019.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Hunt|first=Elle|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/20/lgbt-community-anger-over-youtube-restrictions-which-make-their-videos-invisible|title=LGBT community anger over YouTube restrictions which make their videos invisible|date=2017-03-20|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The internet provides information that can create a safe space for marginalized groups such as the LGBTQIA community to connect with others and engage in honest dialogues and conversations that are affecting their communities. It can also be viewed as an agent of change for the LGBTQIA community and provide a means of engaging in social justice. It can allow for LGBTQIA individuals who may be living in rural areas or in areas where they are isolated to gain access to information that are not within their rural system as well as gaining information from other LGBT individuals. This includes information such as healthcare, partners, and news. GayHealth provides online medical and health information and Gay and Lesbians Alliance Against Defamation contains online publications and news that focus on human rights campaigns and issues focused on LGBTQIA issues. The Internet also allows LGBTQIA individuals to maintain anonymity. Lack of access to the internet can hinder these things, due to lack of broadband access in remote rural areas. LGBT Tech has emphasized launching newer technologies with 5G technology in order to help close the digital divide that can cause members of the LGBTQIA community to lose access to reliable and fast technology that can provide information on healthcare, economic opportunities, and safe communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lgbttech.org/post/the-potential-of-5g-to-reduce-the-digital-divide|title=The potential of 5G to reduce the digital divide|last=Director &amp;amp;amp;|first=Carlos Gutierrez-Deputy|date=2020-01-27|website=lgbttech|language=en|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\n===Age gap===\n\nOlder adults, those ages 60 and up, face various barriers that contribute to their lack of access to information and communication technologies (ICTs). Many adults are \"[[Digital Immigrants|digital immigrants]]\" who have not had lifelong exposure to digital media and have had to adapt to incorporating it in their lives.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vidal|first=Elizabeth|date=October 2019|title=Digital Literacy Program: Reducing the Digital Gap of the Elderly: Experiences and Lessons Learned|journal=2019 International Conference on Inclusive Technologies and Education (CONTIE)|location=San Jose del Cabo, Mexico|publisher=IEEE|pages=117\u20131173|doi=10.1109/CONTIE49246.2019.00030|isbn=978-1-7281-5436-7}}</ref> A study in 2005 found that only 26% of people aged 65 and over were Internet users, compared to 67% in the 50-64 age group and 80% in the 30-49 year age group.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Czaja|first=Sara|last2=Schulz|first2=Richard|date=2006|title=Innovations in Technology and Aging Introduction|url=|journal=Generations: Journal of the American Society on Aging.|volume=30|issue=2|pages=6\u20138|via=}}</ref> This \"grey divide\" can be due to factors such as concern over security, motivation and self-efficacy, decline of memory or spatial orientation, cost, or lack of support.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Friemel|first=Thomas N|date=February 2016|title=The digital divide has grown old: Determinants of a digital divide among seniors|journal=New Media & Society|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=313\u2013331|doi=10.1177/1461444814538648|issn=1461-4448}}</ref> The aforementioned variables of race, disability, gender, and sexual orientation also add to the barriers for older adults.\n\nMany older adults may have physical or mental disabilities that render them homebound and financially insecure. They may be unable to afford internet access or lack transportation to use computers in public spaces, the benefits of which would be enhancing their health and reducing their social isolation and depression. Homebound older adults would benefit from internet use by using it to access health information, use telehealth resources, shop and bank online, and stay connected with friends or family using email or social networks.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Choi|first=Namkee G|last2=DiNitto|first2=Diana M|date=2013-05-02|title=The Digital Divide Among Low-Income Homebound Older Adults: Internet Use Patterns, eHealth Literacy, and Attitudes Toward Computer/Internet Use|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|language=en|volume=15|issue=5|pages=e93|doi=10.2196/jmir.2645|pmc=3650931|pmid=23639979}}</ref>\n\nThose in more privileged socio-economic positions and with a higher level of education are more likely to have internet access than those older adults living in poverty. Lack of access to the internet inhibits \"capital-enhancing activities\" such as accessing government assistance, job opportunities, or investments.

The Facebook Divide, Facebook native, Facebook immigrants, and Facebook left-behind are concepts for social and business management research. Facebook Immigrants are utilizing Facebook for their accumulation of both bonding and bridging social capital. These Facebook Native, Facebook Immigrants, and Facebook left-behind induced the situation of Facebook inequality. In February 2018, the Facebook Divide Index was introduced at the ICMAPRANE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jaipuria.ac.in/icmaprane2018/icmaprane-2018/ |title=ICMAPRANE 2018 |work=Jaipuria.ac.in |date=June 20, 2014 |accessdate=2018-10-26}}</ref> conference in Noida, India, to illustrate the Facebook Divide phenomenon.\n\n==Overcoming the divide==\n\nAn individual must be able to connect in order to achieve enhancement of social and [[cultural capital]] as well as achieve mass economic gains in productivity.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}  Therefore, access is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for overcoming the digital divide. Access to ICT meets significant challenges that stem from income restrictions. The borderline between ICT as a [[necessity good]] and ICT as a [[luxury good]] is roughly around the \"magical number\" of US$10 per person per month, or US$120 per year,<ref name=\"HilbertWD38,5\">{{Cite journal| last1 = Hilbert | first1 = Martin| title = When is Cheap, Cheap Enough to Bridge the Digital Divide? Modeling Income Related Structural Challenges of Technology Diffusion in Latin America| doi = 10.1016/j.worlddev.2009.11.019| journal = World Development| volume = 38| issue = 5| pages = 756\u2013770| year = 2010| url = http://martinhilbert.net/CheapEnoughWD_Hilbert_pre-print.pdf}}</ref> which means that people consider ICT expenditure of US$120 per year as a basic necessity. Since more than 40% of the world population lives on less than US$2 per day, and around 20% live on less than US$1 per day (or less than US$365 per year), these income segments would have to spend one third of their income on ICT (120/365 = 33%). The global average of ICT spending is at a mere 3% of income.<ref name=\"HilbertWD38,5\"/> Potential solutions include driving down the costs of ICT, which includes low-cost technologies and shared access through [[Telecentre]]s.\n\nFurthermore, even though individuals might be capable of accessing the Internet, many are thwarted by barriers to entry, such as a lack of means to infrastructure or the inability to comprehend the information that the Internet provides. Lack of adequate infrastructure and lack of knowledge are two major obstacles that impede mass connectivity. These barriers limit individuals' capabilities in what they can do and what they can achieve in accessing technology. Some individuals can connect, but they do not have the knowledge to use what information ICTs and Internet technologies provide them. This leads to a focus on capabilities and skills, as well as awareness to move from mere access to effective usage of ICT.<ref name=\":2\">Karen Mossberger (2003). Virtual Inequality: Beyond the Digital Divide. Georgetown University Press</ref>\n\nThe [[United Nations]] is aiming to raise awareness of the divide by way of the [[World Information Society Day]] which has taken place yearly since May 17, 2006.<ref>[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/news-and-in-focus-articles/in-focus-articles/ United Nations Educational] UNDay</ref> It also set up the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Task Force in November 2001.<ref>[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2001/dev2353.doc.htm \"UN Information and Communication Technologies (ITC) Task Force Launched Today at Headquarters\"], Press Release, United Nations (New York), November 20, 2001</ref> Later [[UN]] initiatives in this area are the [[World Summit on the Information Society]], which was set up in 2003, and the [[Internet Governance Forum]], set up in 2006.\n\nIn the year 2000, the [[United Nations Volunteers]] (UNV) programme launched its Online Volunteering service,<ref>[https://onlinevolunteering.org Online Volunteering]</ref> which uses ICT as a vehicle for and in support of volunteering. It constitutes an example of a volunteering initiative that effectively contributes to bridge the digital divide. ICT-enabled volunteering has a clear added value for development. If more people collaborate online with more development institutions and initiatives, this will imply an increase in person-hours dedicated to development cooperation at essentially no additional cost. This is the most visible effect of online volunteering for human development.<ref>Acevedo, Manuel. 2005.

The former describes phenomena such as the divided users' demographics that make up sites such as Facebook and Myspace or Word Press and Tumblr. Each of these sites hosts thriving communities that engage with otherwise [[marginalized]] populations. An example of this is the large online community devoted to Afrofuturism, a discourse that critiques dominant structures of power by merging themes of science fiction and blackness. Social media brings together minds that may not otherwise meet, allowing for the free exchange of ideas and empowerment of marginalized discourses.\n\n=== Libraries ===\n[[File:13394-Laptops Anytime Launch-6629 (10844113484).jpg|thumb|A laptop lending kiosk at [[Texas A&M University\u2013Commerce]]'s Gee Library]]\n\nAttempts to bridge the digital divide include a program developed in Durban, South Africa, where deficient access to technology and a lack of documented cultural heritage has motivated the creation of an \"online indigenous digital library as part of public library services.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Greyling | first1 = E. | last2 = Zulu | first2 = S. | year = 2010 | title = Content development in an indigenous digital library: A case study in community participation | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b4190d9002582db2c23292cf7828d9ca3d273016| journal = IFLA Journal | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 30\u20139 | doi = 10.1177/0340035209359570 }}</ref> This project has the potential to narrow the digital divide by not only giving the people of the Durban area access to this digital resource, but also by incorporating the community members into the process of creating it.\n\nTo address the divide [[The Gates Foundation]] started the Gates Library Initiative which provides training  assistance and guidance in libraries.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal | last1 = Blau | first1 = A | year = 2002 | title = Access isn't enough: Merely connecting people and computers won't close the digital divide | url = | journal = American Libraries | volume = 33 | issue = 6| pages = 50\u201352 }}</ref>\n\nIn nations where poverty compounds effects of the digital divide, programs are emerging to counter those trends.  In Kenya, lack of funding, language, and technology illiteracy contributed to an overall lack of computer skills and educational advancement. This slowly began to change when foreign investment began.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} In the early 2000s, the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]] funded a revitalization project through the [[Kenya National Library Service]].  Those resources enabled public libraries to provide information and communication technologies to their patrons.  In 2012, public libraries in the [[Busia County|Busia]] and [[Kiberia]] communities introduced technology resources to supplement curriculum for primary schools.

CI is concerned with ensuring the opportunity not only for ICT access at the community level but also, according to [[Michael Gurstein]], that the means for the \"effective use\" of ICTs for community betterment and empowerment are available.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gurstein|first=Michael|title=Effective use: A community informatics strategy beyond the digital divide|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/1107/1027|accessdate=June 12, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309051347/http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/1107/1027|archive-date=March 9, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Gurstein has also extended the discussion of the digital divide to include issues around access to and the use of \"open data\" and coined the term \"data divide\" to refer to this issue area.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gurstein|first=Michael|title=Open data: Empowering the empowered or effective data use for everyone?|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/3316/2764|accessdate=June 12, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124005256/http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/3316/2764|archive-date=November 24, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Implications==\n\n===Social capital===\nOnce an individual is connected, Internet connectivity and ICTs can enhance his or her future social and cultural capital. [[Social capital]] is acquired through repeated interactions with other individuals or groups of individuals. Connecting to the Internet creates another set of means by which to achieve repeated interactions. ICTs and Internet connectivity enable repeated interactions through access to social networks, chat rooms, and gaming sites. Once an individual has access to connectivity, obtains infrastructure by which to connect, and can understand and use the information that ICTs and connectivity provide, that individual is capable of becoming a \"digital citizen.\" <ref name=\"MossbergerRacePlace\"/>\n\n=== Economic disparity ===\nIn the United States, the research provided by Sungard Availability Services notes a direct correlation between a company's access to technological advancements and its overall success in bolstering the economy.<ref name=\"Forbes1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2016/07/16/lack-of-digital-cloud-opportunities-is-actually-embarrassing-for-employees-survey-suggests/|title=Lack Of Digital, Cloud Opportunities Is Actually Embarrassing For Employees, Survey Suggests|last=McKendrick|first=Joe|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-04-17}}</ref>&nbsp;The study, which includes over 2,000 IT executives and staff officers, indicates that 69 percent of employees feel they do not have access to sufficient technology in order to make their jobs easier, while 63 percent of them believe the lack of technological mechanisms hinders their ability to develop new work skills.<ref name=Forbes1/>&nbsp;Additional analysis provides more evidence to show how the digital divide also affects the economy in places all over the world.

[[Web 2.0]] technologies like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Blogs enable users to participate online and create content without having to understand how the technology actually works, leading to an ever-increasing digital divide between those who have the skills and understanding to interact more fully with the technology and those who are passive consumers of it.<ref name=\"Reilley\" /> Many are only nominal content creators through the use of Web 2.0, posting photos and status updates on Facebook, but not truly interacting with the technology.\n\nSome of the reasons for this production gap include material factors like the type of Internet connection one has and the frequency of access to the Internet. The more frequently a person has access to the Internet and the faster the connection, the more opportunities they have to gain the technology skills and the more time they have to be creative.<ref name=\"Schradie\">{{cite journal | last1 = Schradie | first1 = Jen | year = 2011 | title = The Digital Production Gap: The Digital Divide and Web 2.0 Collide | url = http://sociology.berkeley.edu/documents/newspage_docs/J.%20Schradie%20-%20The%20Digital%20Production%20Gap%20for%20Web%20Post%20Poetics.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120227005023/http://sociology.berkeley.edu/documents/newspage_docs/J.%20Schradie%20-%20The%20Digital%20Production%20Gap%20for%20Web%20Post%20Poetics.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2012-02-27 | journal = Poetics | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 145\u2013168 | doi = 10.1016/j.poetic.2011.02.003 }}</ref>\n\nOther reasons include cultural factors often associated with class and socioeconomic status.

The term \"digital divide\" does not necessarily mean that someone does not have technology; it could mean that there is simply a difference in technology.  These differences can refer to, for example, high-quality computers, fast Internet, technical assistance, or telephone services. The difference between all of these is also considered a gap.\n\nThere is a large inequality worldwide in terms of the distribution of installed telecommunication bandwidth. In 2014 only three countries (China, US, Japan) host 50% of the globally installed bandwidth potential (see pie-chart Figure on the right).<ref name=\"HilbertBitsDivide\"/> This concentration is not new, as historically only ten countries have hosted 70\u201375% of the global telecommunication capacity (see Figure). The U.S. lost its global leadership in terms of installed bandwidth in 2011, being replaced by China, which hosts more than twice as much national bandwidth potential in 2014 (29% versus 13% of the global total).<ref name=\"HilbertBitsDivide\"/>\n\n===Versus the digital divide===\nThe global digital divide is a special case of the digital divide; the focus is set on the fact that \"Internet has developed unevenly throughout the world\"<ref name=Guillen-2005/>{{rp|681}} causing some countries to fall behind in technology, education, labor, democracy, and tourism.  The concept of the digital divide was originally popularized regarding the disparity in Internet access between rural and urban areas of the United States of America; the ''global'' digital divide mirrors this disparity on an international scale.\n\nThe global digital divide also contributes to the inequality of access to goods and services available through technology.  Computers and the Internet provide users with improved education, which can lead to higher wages; the people living in nations with limited access are therefore disadvantaged.<ref>Krueger 1993; Attewell and Battle 1999.</ref> This global divide is often characterized as falling along what is sometimes called the [[North\u2013South divide]] of \"northern\" wealthier nations and \"southern\" poorer ones.\n\n===Obstacles to a solution===\nSome people argue that necessities need to be considered before achieving digital inclusion, such as an ample food supply and quality health care.  Minimizing the global digital divide requires considering and addressing the following types of access:\n\n====Physical access====\nInvolves \"the distribution of ICT devices per capita\u2026and land lines per thousands\".<ref name=Wilson-2004/>{{rp|306}}  Individuals need to obtain access to computers, landlines, and networks in order to access the Internet. This access barrier is also addressed in Article 21 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by the United Nations.\n\n====Financial access====\nThe cost of ICT devices, traffic, applications, technician and educator training, software, maintenance, and infrastructures require ongoing financial means.<ref name=\"HilbertWD38,5\" />\nFinancial access and \"the levels of household income play a significant role in widening the gap\" <ref>\u201cDigital Divide.\u201d The Digital Divide, Stanford University, cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs201/projects/digital-divide/start.html. Retrieved September 19, 2017.</ref>\n\n====Socio-demographic access====\nEmpirical tests have identified that several socio-demographic characteristics foster or limit ICT access and usage. Among different countries, educational levels and income are the most powerful explanatory variables, with age being a third one.<ref name=\"HilbertDigDiv2011\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Hilbert | first1 = Martin| title = The end justifies the definition: The manifold outlooks on the digital divide and their practical usefulness for policy-making | doi = 10.1016/j.telpol.2011.06.012 | journal = Telecommunications Policy | volume = 35 | issue = 8 | pages = 715\u2013736| year = 2011 | url = http://martinhilbert.net/ManifoldDigitalDivide_Hilbert_AAM.pdf}}</ref><ref name=\"HilbertWD38,5\"/>\n\nWhile a Global Gender Gap in access and usage of ICT's exist, empirical evidence shows that this is due to unfavorable conditions concerning employment, education and income and not to technophobia or lower ability. In the contexts understudy, women with the prerequisites for access and usage turned out to be more active users of digital tools than men.<ref name=HilbertGend2011 />  In the US, for example, the figures for 2018 show 89% of men and 88% of women use the Internet.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/184415/percentage-of-us-adults-who-are-internet-users-by-gender/ |title = U.S. Internet penetration by gender 2000-2018}}</ref>\n\n====Cognitive access====\nIn order to use computer technology, a certain level of information literacy is needed.   Further challenges include information overload and the ability to find and use reliable information.\n\n====Design access====\nComputers need to be accessible to individuals with different learning and physical abilities including complying with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 in the United States.<ref>[http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=Laws Section 508] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806075749/http://section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=Laws |date=August 6, 2013 }} (1998). United States Government.</ref>\n\n====Institutional access====\nIn illustrating institutional access, Wilson states \"the numbers of users are greatly affected by whether access is offered only through individual homes or whether it is offered through schools, community centers, religious institutions, cybercaf\u00e9s, or post offices, especially in poor countries where computer access at work or home is highly limited\".<ref name=Wilson-2004/>{{rp|303}}\n\n====Political access====\nGuillen & Suarez argue that \"democratic political regimes enable faster growth of the Internet than authoritarian or totalitarian regimes.\" <ref name=Guillen-2005/>{{rp|687}}  The Internet is considered a form of e-democracy, and attempting to control what citizens can or cannot view is in contradiction to this.

Retrieved April 13, 2014, from http://www.internetworldstats.com/links10.htm</ref>\n\n*Economic equality \u2013 For example, the telephone is often seen as one of the most important components, because having access to a working telephone can lead to higher safety. If there were to be an emergency, one could easily call for help if one could use a nearby phone. In another example, many work-related tasks are online, and people without access to the Internet may not be able to complete work up to company standards. The Internet is regarded by some as a basic component of civic life that developed countries ought to guarantee for their citizens. Additionally, welfare services, for example, are sometimes offered via the Internet.<ref name=\"internetworldstats.com\"/>\n*Social mobility \u2013 Computer and Internet use is regarded as being very important to development and success. However, some children are not getting as much technical education as others, because lower socioeconomic areas cannot afford to provide schools with computer facilities. For this reason, some kids are being separated and not receiving the same chance as others to be successful.<ref name=\"internetworldstats.com\"/>\n*Democracy \u2013 Some people believe that eliminating the digital divide would help countries become healthier democracies. They argue that communities would become much more involved in events such as elections or decision making.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00418|title=Inclusion of excluded groups in decision-making in the development of technologies|last=Social Impact Open Repository|date=2011|website=SIOR|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905142527/http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00418|archive-date=September 5, 2017|url-status=dead|access-date=September 5, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"internetworldstats.com\"/>\n*Economic growth \u2013 It is believed that less-developed nations could gain quick access to economic growth if the information infrastructure were to be developed and well used. By improving the latest technologies, certain countries and industries can gain a competitive advantage.<ref name=\"internetworldstats.com\"/>\n\nWhile these four arguments are meant to lead to a solution to the digital divide, there are a couple of other components that need to be considered. The first one is rural living versus suburban living. Rural areas used to have very minimal access to the Internet, for example. However, nowadays, power lines and satellites are used to increase the availability in these areas. Another component to keep in mind is disabilities. Some people may have the highest quality technologies, but a disability they have may keep them from using these technologies to their fullest extent.<ref name=\"internetworldstats.com\"/>\n\nUsing previous studies (Gamos, 2003; Nsengiyuma & Stork, 2005; Harwit, 2004 as cited in James), James asserts that in developing countries, \"internet use has taken place overwhelmingly among the upper-income, educated, and urban segments\" largely due to the high literacy rates of this sector of the population.<ref name=James-2008>{{cite journal | last1 = James | first1 = J | year = 2008 | title = Digital Divide Complacency: Misconceptions and Dangers | journal = The Information Society | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 54\u201361 | doi = 10.1080/01972240701774790 }}</ref>{{rp|58}} As such, James suggests that part of the solution requires that developing countries first build up the literacy/language skills, [[computer literacy]], and technical competence that low-income and rural populations need in order to make use of ICT.\n\nIt has also been suggested that there is a correlation between democrat regimes and the growth of the Internet. One hypothesis by Gullen is, \"The more democratic the polity, the greater the Internet use...The government can try to control the Internet by monopolizing control\" and Norris ''et al.'' also contends, \"If there is less government control of it, the Internet flourishes, and it is associated with greater democracy and civil liberties.<ref name=PickAndAzari-2008>{{cite journal | last1 = Pick | first1 = J. | last2 = Azari | first2 = R. | year = 2008 | title = Global Digital Divide: Influence of Socioeconomic, Governmental, and Accessibility Factors on Information Technology | url = | journal = Information Technology for Development | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 91\u2013115 | doi=10.1002/itdj.20095}}</ref>\n\nFrom an economic perspective, Pick and Azari state that \"in developing nations\u2026foreign direct investment (FDI), primary education, educational investment, access to education, and government prioritization of ICT as all-important\".<ref name=PickAndAzari-2008/>{{rp|112}} Specific solutions proposed by the study include: \"invest in stimulating, attracting, and growing creative technical and scientific workforce; increase the access to education and digital literacy; reduce the gender divide and empower women to participate in the ICT workforce; emphasize investing in intensive Research and Development for selected metropolitan areas and regions within nations\".<ref name=PickAndAzari-2008/>{{rp|111}}\n\nThere are projects worldwide that have implemented, to various degrees, the solutions outlined above.  Many such projects have taken the form of Information Communications Technology Centers (ICT centers).  Rahnman explains that \"the main role of ICT intermediaries is defined as an organization providing effective support to local communities in the use and adaptation of technology.  Most commonly, an ICT intermediary will be a specialized organization from outside the community, such as a non-governmental organization, local government, or international donor. On the other hand, a social intermediary is defined as a local institution from within the community, such as a community-based organization.<ref>Rahman, H. (2006). ''Empowering Marginal Communities and Information Networking''. Hershey, Pennsylvania: Idea Group Publishing.</ref>{{rp|128}}\n\nOther proposed solutions that the Internet promises for developing countries are the provision of efficient communications within and among developing countries so that citizens worldwide can effectively help each other to solve their problems. Grameen Banks and Kiva loans are two microcredit systems designed to help citizens worldwide to contribute online towards entrepreneurship in developing communities. Economic opportunities range from entrepreneurs who can afford the hardware and broadband access required to maintain Internet caf\u00e9s to agribusinesses having control over the seeds they plant.\n\nAt the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], the IMARA organization (from [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word for \"power\") sponsors a variety of outreach programs which bridge the Global Digital Divide. Its aim is to find and implement long-term, sustainable solutions which will increase the availability of educational technology and resources to domestic and international communities. These projects are run under the aegis of the [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]] (CSAIL) and staffed by MIT volunteers who give training, install and donate computer setups in greater [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Kenya]], Indian reservations the American Southwest such as the [[Navajo Nation]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]]. The CommuniTech project strives to empower underserved communities through sustainable technology and education.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Fizz|first1=Robyn|last2=Mansur|first2=Karla|title=Helping MIT neighbors cross the 'digital divide'|newspaper=MIT Tech Talk|date=June 4, 2008|publisher=Cambridge: MIT|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2008/techtalk52-28.pdf|page=3}}</ref><ref>[http://imara.csail.mit.edu/ IMARA Project at MIT]</ref><ref>Fizz, Robyn, [http://ist.mit.edu/news/communitech \"CommuniTech Works Locally to Bridge the Digital Divide\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818173543/http://ist.mit.edu/news/communitech |date=August 18, 2011 }}, ''IST News'', MIT, April 8, 2011</ref> According to Dominik Hartmann of the MIT's Media Lab, interdisciplinary approaches are needed to bridge the global digital divide.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Hartmann|first1=Dominik|title=Building bridges|newspaper=D+C, development&cooperation|date=March 25, 2016|url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/innovative-interdisciplinary-approaches-needed-tackle-digital-divide-and-growing-inequality}}</ref>\n\nBuilding on the premise that any effective solution must be decentralized, allowing the local communities in developing nations to generate their content, one scholar has posited that social media\u2014like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter\u2014may be useful tools in closing the divide.<ref name=\"AliHRJ\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ali | first1 = Amir | year = 2011 | title = The Power of Social Media in Developing Nations: New Tools for Closing the Global Digital Divide and Beyond | url = http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/185-220.pdf | journal = Harvard Human Rights Journal | volume = 24 | issue =  | page = 1 | access-date = March 30, 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121114083745/http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/185-220.pdf | archive-date = November 14, 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref> As Amir Hatem Ali suggests, \"the popularity and generative nature of social media empower individuals to combat some of the main obstacles to bridging the digital divide\".<ref name=\"AliHRJ\"/>{{rp|188}} Facebook's statistics reinforce this claim.

Amongst them, are its ability to offer a means of interacting with others, user-friendly features, and the fact that most sites are available at no cost.<ref name=\"AliHRJ\"/> The problem with social media, however, is that it can be accessible, provided that there is physical access.<ref name=\"AliHRJ\"/> Nevertheless, with its ability to encourage digital inclusion, social media can be used as a tool to bridge the global digital divide.<ref name=\"AliHRJ\"/>\n\nSome cities in the world have started programs to bridge the digital divide for their residents, school children, students, parents and the elderly. One such program, founded in 1996, was sponsored by the city of Boston and called the Boston Digital Bridge Foundation.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20021008225433/http://www.digitalbridgefoundation.org/ (Boston) Digital Bridge Foundation]</ref> It especially concentrates on school children and their parents, helping to make both equally and similarly knowledgeable about computers, using application programs, and navigating the Internet.<ref>[http://www.cityofboston.gov/news/Default.aspx?id=1479 \"Mayor Menino, Boston Digital Bridge Foundation Host Evening on the Bridge 2.0 Celebration\"], Mayor's Office, Boston, Press Release, September 26, 2002</ref><ref>[http://www.cityofboston.gov/news/default.aspx?id=4765 \"City of Boston Receives $4.3 Million Grant That Will Give Training, Computers and Opportunity to Underserved Communities\"], City of Boston press office, September 14, 2010</ref>\n\n===Free Basics===\n{{Main|Free Basics}}\n\nFree Basics is a partnership between social networking services company Facebook and six companies (Samsung, Ericsson, MediaTek, Opera Software, Nokia and Qualcomm) that plans to bring affordable access to selected Internet services to less developed countries by increasing efficiency, and facilitating the development of new business models around the provision of Internet access. In the whitepaper<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scontent-cdg2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/12057105_1001874746531417_622371037_n.pdf?oh=4a6afa24c125a3debe1784bcacefa8b4&oe=5B03C427|title=Is connectivity a human right?|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}{{Dead link|date=January 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> realised by Facebook's founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, connectivity is asserted as a \"human right\", and Internet.org is created to improve Internet access for people around the world.\n\n\"Free Basics provides people with access to useful services on their mobile phones in markets where internet access may be less affordable. The websites are available for free without data charges, and include content about news, employment, health, education and local information etc. By introducing people to the benefits of the internet through these websites, we hope to bring more people online and help improve their lives.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://info.internet.org/en/|title=Internet.org:About|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Free Basics is also accused of violating [[net neutrality]] for limiting access to handpicked services. Despite a wide deployment in numerous countries, it has been met with heavy resistance notably in India where the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India eventually banned it in 2016.\n\n===Satellite constellations===\n\nSeveral projects to bring internet to the entire world with a [[satellite constellation]] have been devised in the last decade, one of these being [[Starlink (satellite constellation)|Starlink]] by [[Elon Musk]]'s company [[SpaceX]]. Unlike Free Basics, it would provide people with a full internet access and would not be limited to a few selected services. In the same week Starlink was announced, serial-entrepreneur Richard Branson announced his own project [[OneWeb satellite constellation|OneWeb]], a similar constellation with approximately 700 satellites that has already procured communication frequency licenses for their broadcast spectrum and could possibly be operational as early as in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-satellite-entrepreneurs-20150117-story.html|title=Elon Musk and Richard Branson invest in satellite-Internet ventures|last=|first=|date=January 17, 2015|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe biggest hurdle to these projects is the astronomical, financial, and logistical cost of launching so many satellites. After the failure of previous satellite-to-consumer space ventures, satellite industry consultant Roger Rusch said \"It's highly unlikely that you can make a successful business out of this.\" Musk has publicly acknowledged this business reality, and indicated in mid-2015 that while endeavoring to develop this technically-complicated space-based communication system he wants to avoid overextending the company and stated that they are being measured in the pace of development.\n\n===One Laptop per Child===\n\n[[One Laptop per Child]] (OLPC) is another attempt to narrow the digital divide.<ref name=\"wiki.laptop.org\">[http://one.laptop.org/about/mission One Laptop Per Child]. (2009).</ref> This organization, founded in 2005, provides inexpensively produced \"XO\" laptops (dubbed the \"$100 laptop\", though actual production costs vary) to children residing in poor and isolated regions within developing countries. Each laptop belongs to an individual child and provides a gateway to digital learning and Internet access. The XO laptops are designed to withstand more abuse than higher-end machines, and they contain features in context to the unique conditions that remote villages present. Each laptop is constructed to use as little power as possible, have a sunlight-readable screen, and is capable of automatically networking with other XO laptops in order to access the Internet\u2014as many as 500 machines can share a single point of access.<ref name=\"wiki.laptop.org\"/>\n\n==World Summit on the Information Society==\n{{Main |World Summit on the Information Society}}\n\nSeveral of the 67 principles adopted at the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] convened by the [[United Nations]] in Geneva in 2003 directly address the digital divide:<ref name=WSIS-03>[http://www.itu.int/wsis/docs/geneva/official/dop.html \"Declaration of Principles\"], WSIS-03/GENEVA/DOC/4-E, World Summit on the Information Society, Geneva, December 12, 2003</ref>\n:10. We are also fully aware that the benefits of the information technology revolution are today unevenly distributed between the developed and developing countries and within societies. We are fully committed to turning this digital divide into a digital opportunity for all, particularly for those who risk being left behind and being further marginalized.\n:11. We are committed to realizing our common vision of the Information Society for ourselves and for future generations. We recognize that young people are the future workforce and leading creators and earliest adopters of ICTs. They must therefore be empowered as learners, developers, contributors, entrepreneurs and decision-makers. We must focus especially on young people who have not yet been able to benefit fully from the opportunities provided by ICTs. We are also committed to ensuring that the development of ICT applications and operation of services respects the rights of children as well as their protection and well-being.\n:12. We affirm that development of ICTs provides enormous opportunities for women, who should be an integral part of, and key actors, in the Information Society. We are committed to ensuring that the Information Society enables women's empowerment and their full participation on the basis on equality in all spheres of society and in all decision-making processes. To this end, we should mainstream a gender equality perspective and use ICTs as a tool to that end.\n:13. In building the Information Society, we shall pay particular attention to the special needs of marginalized and vulnerable groups of society, including migrants, internally displaced persons and refugees, unemployed and underprivileged people, minorities and nomadic people. We shall also recognize the special needs of older persons and persons with disabilities.\n:14. We are resolute to empower the poor, particularly those living in remote, rural and marginalized urban areas, to access information and to use ICTs as a tool to support their efforts to lift themselves out of poverty.\n:15. In the evolution of the Information Society, particular attention must be given to the special situation of indigenous peoples, as well as to the preservation of their heritage and their cultural legacy.\n:16. We continue to pay special attention to the particular needs of people of developing countries, countries with economies in transition, Least Developed Countries, Small Island Developing States, Landlocked Developing Countries, Highly Indebted Poor Countries, countries and territories under occupation, countries recovering from conflict and countries and regions with special needs as well as to conditions that pose severe threats to development, such as natural disasters.\n:21. Connectivity is a central enabling agent in building the Information Society. Universal, ubiquitous, equitable and affordable access to ICT infrastructure and services, constitutes one of the challenges of the Information Society and should be an objective of all stakeholders involved in building it. Connectivity also involves access to energy and postal services, which should be assured in conformity with the domestic legislation of each country.\n:28. We strive to promote universal access with equal opportunities for all to scientific knowledge and the creation and dissemination of scientific and technical information, including open access initiatives for scientific publishing.\n:46. In building the Information Society, States are strongly urged to take steps with a view to the avoidance of, and refrain from, any unilateral measure not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations that impedes the full achievement of economic and social development by the population of the affected countries, and that hinders the well-being of their population.\n\n==See also==\n{{Library resources box}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Achievement gap]]\n* [[Participation (decision making)#Civic opportunity gap|Civic opportunity gap]]\n* [[Computer technology for developing areas]]\n* [[Digital divide by country]]\n* [[Digital divide in Canada]]\n* [[Digital divide in China]]\n* [[Digital divide in South Africa]]\n* [[Digital divide in Thailand]]\n* [[Digital rights]]\n* [[Digital Society Day]] (October 17 in India)\n* [[Global Internet usage]]\n* [[Information society]]\n* [[International communication]]\n* [[Internet Geography|Internet geography]]\n* [[Internet governance]]\n* [[List of countries by Internet connection speeds]]\n* [[National broadband plans from around the world]]\n* [[NetDay]]\n* [[Rural Internet]]\n\n===Groups devoted to digital divide issues===\n* [[Center for Digital Inclusion]]\n* [[Digital Textbook]] a [[South Korea]]n Project that intends to distribute tablet notebooks to elementary school students.\n* [[Inveneo]]\n* [[TechChange]]\n* [[United Nations Information and Communication Technologies Task Force]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = I'd blush if I could: closing gender divides in digital skills through education\n| author = UNESCO, EQUALS Skills Coalition\n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = \n| source = UNESCO\n| documentURL = https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000367416\n| license statement URL = \n| license = CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO\n}}\n\n== References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Azam, M.

Brockton was part of this area, which the English renamed [[Bridgewater, Massachusetts|Bridgewater]], until 1821, when it became the town of North Bridgewater. Its name changed in 1874, after a contentious process finally decided on naming it after [[Isaac Brock]] (the initial British commanding general at [[Battle of Queenston Heights|Queenston Heights]], where invading American troops suffered a rout, in [[War of 1812|1812]]), after a local merchant heard of [[Brockville, Ontario]], on a trip to [[Niagara Falls]]. Brockton became a city on April 9, 1881. During the [[American Civil War]], Brockton was America's largest producer of shoes, and until the latter parts of the 20th century, Brockton had a large shoe and leather products industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wickedlocal.com/x1959832707/Once-known-as-Shoe-City-Brockton-loses-its-last-factory|title=Once known as 'Shoe City,' Brockton loses its last factory|first=Elaine|last=Allegrini|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:1906 Brockton station postcard.JPG|Brockton station on a 1906 postcard\nFile:Oldest House in Brockton Heights, MA.jpg|Oldest house in 1910\nFile:Main Street, Looking North From Crescent, Brockton, MA.jpg|Main Street c. 1910\nFile:Howard & Foster's Shoe Factory, Brockton, MA.jpg|Shoe factory in 1910\n</gallery>\n\n===Historical firsts===\n;World firsts\n* On October 1, 1883, Brockton became the first place in the world to have a [[Three-phase electric power|three-wire]] underground electrical system when [[Thomas Edison]] threw a switch to activate it.<ref>[http://www.thomasedison.com/enlightened.html#brocktonbreak Edison's Fabulous Breakthrough in Brockton, Massachusetts], thomasedison.com; accessed April 16, 2014.</ref>\n* The City Theater opened on October 24, 1894, the first theater in the world to be tied into the three-wire electrical system.\n\n;US firsts\n* On December 30, 1884, the first electrically operated fire station in the United States opened in Brockton.\n* The department store [[Santa Claus]] appeared in Brockton in December 1890, when [[James Edgar (entrepreneur)|James Edgar]], of Edgar's Department Store, suited up for the first time.<ref>[http://1stdepartmentstoresanta.com/james-edgar.pdf Department Store Santa Tradition]; retrieved April 19, 2011</ref>\n* Brockton became the first city in the country to abolish [[grade crossings]] in 1896.\n\n;World Records\n* On November 23, 2010, Brockton set the world record for the most Santa Hat wearers in one place at one time with 872 people participating in the event.<ref>[http://www.worldrecordsacademy.org/mass/most_Santa_hat_wearers_in_one_place_Brockton_sets_world_record_101979.html World Records Academy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515160211/http://www.worldrecordsacademy.org/mass/most_Santa_hat_wearers_in_one_place_Brockton_sets_world_record_101979.html |date=2012-05-15 }}; accessed April 16, 2014.</ref>\n* On November 20, 2011, Brockton doubled the city's Santa Claus hat-wearing record with 1792 people in downtown Brockton wearing hats.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|21.6|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|21.5|sqmi|km2}}  is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} (0.56%) is water.

Brockton was part of this area, which the English renamed [[Bridgewater, Massachusetts|Bridgewater]], until 1821, when it became the town of North Bridgewater. Its name changed in 1874, after a contentious process finally decided on naming it after [[Isaac Brock]] (the initial British commanding general at [[Battle of Queenston Heights|Queenston Heights]], where invading American troops suffered a rout, in [[War of 1812|1812]]), after a local merchant heard of [[Brockville, Ontario]], on a trip to [[Niagara Falls]]. Brockton became a city on April 9, 1881. During the [[American Civil War]], Brockton was America's largest producer of shoes, and until the latter parts of the 20th century, Brockton had a large shoe and leather products industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wickedlocal.com/x1959832707/Once-known-as-Shoe-City-Brockton-loses-its-last-factory|title=Once known as 'Shoe City,' Brockton loses its last factory|first=Elaine|last=Allegrini|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:1906 Brockton station postcard.JPG|Brockton station on a 1906 postcard\nFile:Oldest House in Brockton Heights, MA.jpg|Oldest house in 1910\nFile:Main Street, Looking North From Crescent, Brockton, MA.jpg|Main Street c. 1910\nFile:Howard & Foster's Shoe Factory, Brockton, MA.jpg|Shoe factory in 1910\n</gallery>\n\n===Historical firsts===\n;World firsts\n* On October 1, 1883, Brockton became the first place in the world to have a [[Three-phase electric power|three-wire]] underground electrical system when [[Thomas Edison]] threw a switch to activate it.<ref>[http://www.thomasedison.com/enlightened.html#brocktonbreak Edison's Fabulous Breakthrough in Brockton, Massachusetts], thomasedison.com; accessed April 16, 2014.</ref>\n* The City Theater opened on October 24, 1894, the first theater in the world to be tied into the three-wire electrical system.\n\n;US firsts\n* On December 30, 1884, the first electrically operated fire station in the United States opened in Brockton.\n* The department store [[Santa Claus]] appeared in Brockton in December 1890, when [[James Edgar (entrepreneur)|James Edgar]], of Edgar's Department Store, suited up for the first time.<ref>[http://1stdepartmentstoresanta.com/james-edgar.pdf Department Store Santa Tradition]; retrieved April 19, 2011</ref>\n* Brockton became the first city in the country to abolish [[grade crossings]] in 1896.\n\n;World Records\n* On November 23, 2010, Brockton set the world record for the most Santa Hat wearers in one place at one time with 872 people participating in the event.<ref>[http://www.worldrecordsacademy.org/mass/most_Santa_hat_wearers_in_one_place_Brockton_sets_world_record_101979.html World Records Academy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515160211/http://www.worldrecordsacademy.org/mass/most_Santa_hat_wearers_in_one_place_Brockton_sets_world_record_101979.html |date=2012-05-15 }}; accessed April 16, 2014.</ref>\n* On November 20, 2011, Brockton doubled the city's Santa Claus hat-wearing record with 1792 people in downtown Brockton wearing hats.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|21.6|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|21.5|sqmi|km2}}  is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} (0.56%) is water.

As early as 1930 the city's Planning Board recommended a raised express highway running north\u2013south through the [[Downtown Boston|downtown]] district in order to draw traffic off the city streets.<ref>Daily Boston Globe, December 21, 1930 'Streets In The Air Only Solution To Boston's Traffic Problems So Says the Planning Board That Asks for Two-Level Road Across City, Costing $28,000,000, as First Item in a Big Scheme'</ref> Commissioner of Public Works [[William F.

Governor [[John Volpe]] interceded in the 1950s to change the design of the last section of the Central Artery putting it underground through the [[Dewey Square Tunnel]]. While traffic moved somewhat better, the other problems remained. There was chronic congestion on the Central Artery (I-93), an elevated six-lane highway through the center of downtown Boston, which was, in the words of Pete Sigmund, \"like a funnel full of slowly-moving, or stopped, cars (and swearing motorists).\"<ref name=autogenerated3>{{Cite news |first=Pete |last=Sigmund |url=http://cegltd.com/story.asp?story=8751&headline=Triumph,%20Tragedy%20Mark%20Boston%E2%80%99s%20Big%20Dig%20Project |title=Triumph, Tragedy Mark Boston's Big Dig Project |publisher=Construction Equipment Guide |date=June 6, 2007 |accessdate=December 10, 2007 |df= }}</ref>\nIn 1959, the 1.5-mile-long (2.4&nbsp;km) road section carried approximately 75,000 vehicles a day, but by the 1990s, this had grown to 190,000 vehicles a day.

Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge|Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge]] over the Charles River under construction, looking north. The old elevated Central Artery crossing is to the right.]]\nAnother important motivation for the final form of the Big Dig was the abandonment of the Massachusetts Department of Public Works' intended expressway system through and around Boston. The Central Artery, as part of Mass. DPW's Master Plan of 1948, was originally planned to be the downtown Boston stretch of [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]], and was signed as such; a bypass road called the Inner Belt, was subsequently renamed [[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 695]]. (The law establishing the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956|Interstate highway system]] was enacted in 1956.) The [[Inner Belt District]] was to pass to the west of the downtown core, through the neighborhood of [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]] and the cities of [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], and [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]]. Earlier controversies over impact of the Boston extension of the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]], particularly on the heavily populated neighborhood of [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]], and the additional large amount of housing that would have had to be destroyed led to [[freeway and expressway revolts|massive community opposition]] to both the Inner Belt and the Boston section of I-95.<ref>{{cite web |title=Boston's Cancelled Highways |url=http://www.bostonstreetcars.com/bostons-cancelled-highways.html |website=Boston Streetcars |accessdate=January 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nBuilding demolition and land clearances for I-95 through the neighborhoods of Roxbury, [[Jamaica Plain]], and [[Roslindale]] led to secession threats by [[Hyde Park, Boston|Hyde Park]], Boston's youngest and southernmost neighborhood. By 1972, with only a minimum of work done on the I-95 right of way and none on the potentially massively disruptive Inner Belt, Governor [[Francis Sargent]] put a moratorium on highway construction within the [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route&nbsp;128]] corridor, except for the final short stretch of Interstate 93. In 1974, the remainder of the Master Plan was canceled, leaving Boston with a severely overstressed expressway system for the existing traffic.\n\nWith ever-increasing traffic volumes funneled onto I-93 alone, the Central Artery became chronically gridlocked. The Sargent moratorium led to the rerouting of I-95 away from Boston around the Route&nbsp;128 beltway and the conversion of the cleared land in the southern part of the city into the [[Southwest Corridor Park|Southwest Corridor linear park]], as well as a new right-of-way for the [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] subway and [[Amtrak]].<ref>{{cite web |title=\"Decisions Touching the Lives of All of Us\": The Plan That Changed Boston Forever |url=http://transitcenter.org/2016/06/22/massachusetts-governor-decides-transit-good-highways-bad/ |website=TransitCenter |accessdate=January 28, 2019|date=June 23, 2016 }}</ref> Parts of the planned I-695 right-of-way remain unused and under consideration for future mass-transit projects.\n\nThe original 1948 Master Plan included a Third Harbor Tunnel plan that was hugely controversial in its own right, because it would have disrupted the [[Maverick Square]] area of [[East Boston]].

Boston's Logan Airport lies across [[Boston Harbor]] in East Boston; and before the Big Dig, the only access to the airport from downtown was through the paired [[Callahan Tunnel|Callahan]] and [[Sumner Tunnel|Sumner]] tunnels. Traffic on the major highways from west of Boston\u2014the Massachusetts Turnpike and [[Storrow Drive]]\u2014mostly traveled on portions of the Central Artery to reach these tunnels. Getting between the Central Artery and the tunnels involved short diversions onto city streets, increasing local congestion.\n\n===Mass transit===\nA number of [[public transportation]] projects were included as part of an [[environmental mitigation]] for the Big Dig. The most expensive was the building of the Phase II [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]] tunnel under [[Fort Point Channel]], done in coordination with Big Dig construction. Silver Line buses now use this tunnel and the Ted Williams Tunnel to link [[South Station]] and Logan Airport.\n\n{{As of|2020}}, promised projects to extend the Green Line beyond [[Lechmere (MBTA station)|Lechmere]], to connect the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red]] and [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue]] subway lines, and to restore the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]] streetcar service to the [[Forest Hills (MBTA station)|Arborway]] in [[Jamaica Plain]] have not been completed.

Negotiations with the federal government had led to an agreement to widen some of the lanes in the new harbor tunnel, and accommodating these would require the tunnel to be deeper and mechanically-vented; this left no room for the rail lines, and having diesel trains (then in use) passing through the tunnel would have substantially increased the cost of the ventilation system.<ref name=\"Haglund2003\">{{cite book|last1=Haglund|first1=Charles|title=Inventing the Charles River|date=2003|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0262083078|page=[https://archive.org/details/inventingcharles00hagl/page/316 316]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/inventingcharles00hagl/page/316}}</ref>\n\n==Early planning==\nThe project was conceived in the 1970s by the [[Boston Transportation Planning Review]] to replace the rusting elevated six-lane Central Artery. The expressway separated downtown from the waterfront, and was increasingly choked with bumper-to-bumper traffic. Business leaders were more concerned about access to [[Logan Airport]], and pushed instead for a third harbor tunnel. In their second terms, [[Michael Dukakis]] (governor) and [[Fred Salvucci]] (secretary of transportation) came up with the strategy of tying the two projects together\u2014thereby combining the project that the business community supported with the project that they and the City of Boston supported.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nPlanning for the Big Dig as a project officially began in 1982, with environmental impact studies starting in 1983. After years of extensive lobbying for federal dollars, a 1987 public works bill appropriating funding for the Big Dig was passed by the [[Congress of the United States|US Congress]], but it was vetoed by President [[Ronald Reagan]] for being too expensive. When Congress [[Veto override|overrode]] the veto, the project had its green light and ground was first broken in 1991.<ref>Dan McNichol and Andy Ryan, ''The Big Dig''.

Eventually, MTA combined some of its employees with joint venture employees in an integrated project organization. This was intended to make management more efficient, but it hindered MTA's ability to independently oversee project activities because MTA and the joint venture had effectively become partners in the project.<ref>OIG Testimony CC-2005-027, \"Impact of Water Leaks on the Central Artery/Tunnel Project and Remaining Risks\"</ref>\n\n==Obstacles==\nIn addition to political and financial difficulties, the project faced several environmental and engineering obstacles.\nThe downtown area through which the tunnels were to be dug was largely [[Land reclamation|land fill]], and included existing [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] and [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue Line]] [[rapid transit|subway]] tunnels as well as innumerable pipes and utility lines that would have to be replaced or moved. Tunnel workers encountered many unexpected geological and archaeological barriers, ranging from glacial debris to foundations of buried houses and a number of sunken ships lying within the reclaimed land.\n\nThe project received approval from state environmental agencies in 1991, after satisfying concerns including release of toxins by the excavation and the possibility of disrupting the homes of millions of [[rat]]s, causing them to roam the streets of Boston in search of new housing.

Because the old elevated highway (which remained in operation throughout the construction process) rested on pylons located throughout the designated dig area, engineers first utilized [[slurry wall]] techniques to create {{convert|120|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} concrete walls upon which the highway could rest. These concrete walls also stabilized the sides of the site, preventing cave-ins during the continued excavation process.\n\nThe multi-lane Interstate highway also had to pass under [[South Station (MBTA)|South Station]]'s seven railway tracks, which carried over 40,000 commuters and 400 trains per day. To avoid multiple relocations of train lines while the tunneling advanced, as had been initially planned, a specially designed [[jack (device)|jack]] was constructed to support the ground and tracks to allow the excavation to take place below. Construction crews also used [[ground freezing]] (an artificial induction of [[permafrost]]) to help stabilize surrounding ground as they excavated the tunnel. This was the largest tunneling project undertaken beneath railway lines anywhere in the world. The ground freezing enabled safer, more efficient [[Earthworks (engineering)|excavation]], and also assisted in environmental issues, as less contaminated fill needed to be exported than if a traditional [[Cut-and-cover tunnel|cut-and-cover method]] had been applied.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tunnels.mottmac.com/projects/?mode=region&amp;id=3418 |title=Boston Central Artery Jacked Tunnels - Mott MacDonald Project Page |publisher=Tunnels.mottmac.com |accessdate=April 8, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408221143/https://tunnels.mottmac.com/projects/?mode=region&amp;id=3418 |archivedate=April 8, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nOther challenges included existing subway tunnels crossing the path of the underground highway. To build slurry walls past these tunnels, it was necessary to dig beneath the tunnels and to build an underground concrete bridge to support the tunnels' weight, without interrupting rail service.\n\n==Construction phase==\n[[Image:Boston-big-dig-area.png|thumb|Construction sites of the \"Big Dig\"]]\n\nThe project was managed by the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, with the Big Dig and the Turnpike's Boston Extension from the 1960s being financially and legally joined by the legislature as the [[Metropolitan Highway System]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/81a-3.htm |title=MGL Chapter 81A, Section 3 |publisher=Mass.gov |accessdate=April 8, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726222848/http://www.mass.gov//legis/laws/mgl/81a-3.htm |archivedate=July 26, 2010 }}</ref> Design and construction was supervised by a joint venture of [[Bechtel Corporation]] and [[Parsons Brinckerhoff]]. Because of the enormous size of the project\u2014too large for any company to undertake alone\u2014the design and construction of the Big Dig was broken up into dozens of smaller subprojects with well-defined interfaces between contractors. Major heavy-construction contractors on the project included [[Jay Cashman]], [[Modern Continental]], [[Obayashi Corporation]], [[Perini Building Company|Perini Corporation]], [[Peter Kiewit Sons' Incorporated]], [[J.

Many environmental advocates preferred a river crossing entirely in tunnels, but this, along with 27 other plans, was rejected as too costly. Finally, with a deadline looming to begin construction on a separate project that would connect the [[Tobin Bridge]] to the Charles River crossing, Salvucci overrode the objections and chose a variant of the plan known as \"Scheme Z\".

By the time all parties agreed on the I-93 design, construction of the Tobin connector (today known as the \"City Square Tunnel\" for a [[Charlestown, Boston, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] area it bypasses) was far along, significantly adding to the cost of constructing the [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|US Route 1]] interchange and retrofitting the tunnel. <!--Shift to active voice shortened this sentence a little, but it's still unclear whether the Rt1 work and tunnel retrofit were built, or were abandoned because of the increased cost.-->\n\nBoston blue [[clay]] and other soils extracted from the path of the tunnel were used to cap many local [[landfill]]s, fill in the [[Quincy Quarries Reservation|Granite Rail Quarry]] in [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]], and restore the surface of [[Spectacle Island (Massachusetts)|Spectacle Island]] in the [[Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area]].\n\nThe [[Storrow Drive Connector]], a companion bridge to the Zakim, began carrying traffic from I-93 to [[Storrow Drive]] in 1999. The project had been under consideration for years, but was opposed by the wealthy residents of the [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]] neighborhood. However, it finally was accepted because it would funnel traffic bound for Storrow Drive and downtown Boston away from the mainline roadway.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bostonroads.com/crossings/zakim/ | title=Leonard P.

Eventual [[cost overruns]] were so high that the chairman of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, [[James Kerasiotes]], was fired in 2000. His replacement had to commit to an $8.55 billion cap on federal contributions. The total expenses eventually passed $15 billion. Interest brought this cost to $21.93 billion.\n\n===Engineering methods and details===\n[[Image:BigDigSupportsCentralArtery.agr.jpg|thumb|left|Temporary supports hold up elevated Central Artery during construction.]]\nSeveral unusual engineering challenges arose during the project, requiring unusual solutions and methods to address them.\n\nAt the beginning of the project, engineers had to figure out the safest way to build the tunnel without endangering the existing elevated highway above. Eventually, they created horizontal braces as wide as the tunnel, then cut away the elevated highway's struts, and lowered it onto the new braces.<ref name=\"AP 122507\">{{Cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071225/ap_on_re_us/big_dig_the_end |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228035119/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071225/ap_on_re_us/big_dig_the_end |archivedate=December 28, 2007 |title=Boston's $14.8B Big Dig finally complete |first=Steve |last=LeBlanc |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=December 25, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Final phases==\n[[Image:Tunnel-large.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Interstate 93 Tunnel]]\n\nOn January 18, 2003, the opening ceremony was held for the I-90 Connector Tunnel, extending the Massachusetts Turnpike (Interstate 90) east into the [[Ted Williams Tunnel]], and onwards to Boston [[Logan International Airport]]. The Ted Williams tunnel had been completed and was in limited use for commercial traffic and [[high-occupancy vehicle]]s since late 1995. The westbound lanes opened on the afternoon of January 18 and the eastbound lanes on January 19.\n\nThe next phase, moving the elevated Interstate 93 underground, was completed in two stages: northbound lanes opened in March 2003 and southbound lanes (in a temporary configuration) on December 20, 2003. A tunnel underneath [[Leverett Circle]] connecting eastbound Storrow Drive to I-93 North and the Tobin Bridge opened December 19, 2004, easing congestion at the circle. All southbound lanes of I-93 opened to traffic on March 5, 2005, including the left lane of the Zakim Bridge, and all of the refurbished [[Dewey Square Tunnel]].\n\nBy the end of December 2004, 95% of the Big Dig was completed. Major construction remained on the surface, including construction of final ramp configurations in the [[North End, Boston, Massachusetts|North End]] and in the [[South Bay, Boston, Massachusetts|South Bay]] interchange, and reconstruction of the surface streets.\n\nThe final ramp downtown\u2014exit 20B from [[Interstate 93|I-93]] south to [[Albany Street (Boston)|Albany Street]]\u2014opened January 13, 2006.<ref>{{cite news | first=Casey | last=Ross | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/bostonherald/access/969503741.html?dids=969503741:969503741&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jan+14%2C+2006&author=CASEY+ROSS&pub=Boston+Herald&edition=&startpage=009&desc=Hallelujah+Hub+drivers!+Last+Big+Dig+ramp+done | title=Hallelujah Hub drivers!

The intent of the program was to integrate public art into highway infrastructure (retaining walls, fences, and lighting) and the essential elements of the pedestrian environment (walkways, park landscape elements, and bridges). As overall project costs increased, the Artery Arts Program was seen as a potential liability, even though there was support and interest from the public and professional arts organizations in the area.\n\nAt the beginning of the highway design process, a temporary arts program was initiated, and over 50 proposals were selected. However, development began on only a few projects before funding for the program was cut. Permanent public art that was funded includes: super graphic text and facades of former [[West End, Boston|West End]] houses cast into the concrete elevated highway abutment support walls near [[North Station]] by artist [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]]; Harbor Fog, a sensor-activated mist, light and sound sculptural environment by artist [[Ross Miller (artist)|Ross Miller]] in parcel 17; a historical sculpture celebrating the 18th and 19th century shipbuilding industry and a bust of shipbuilder [[Donald McKay]] in [[East Boston]]; blue interior lighting of the Zakim Bridge; and the [[Millers River (Middlesex)|Miller's River]] Littoral Way walkway and lighting under the loop ramps north of the [[Charles River]].\n\nExtensive landscape planting, as well as a maintenance program to support the plantings, was requested by many community members during public meetings. <!-- need more details on landscape program here -->\n\n==Impact on traffic==\n[[Image:ONeilltoZakimBridge.agr.jpg|thumb|Traffic exiting the Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Tunnel onto the Zakim Bridge.]]\nThe Big Dig untangled the co-mingled traffic from the Massachusetts Turnpike and the Sumner and Callahan tunnels. While only one net lane in each direction was added to the north\u2013south I-93, several new east\u2013west lanes became available. East\u2013west traffic on the Massachusetts Turnpike/I-90 now proceeds directly through the Ted Williams Tunnel to Logan Airport and Route 1A beyond. Traffic between Storrow Drive and the Callahan and Sumner Tunnels still uses a short portion of I-93, but additional lanes and direct connections are provided for this traffic.\n\nThe result was a 62% reduction in vehicle hours of travel on I-93, the airport tunnels, and the connection from Storrow Drive, from an average 38,200 hours per day before construction (1994\u20131995) to 14,800 hours per day in 2004\u20132005, after the project was largely complete.<ref name=impactreport>{{cite web |url= http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |title= Archived copy |accessdate=November 4, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110108043647/http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |archivedate= January 8, 2011 }} Transportation Impacts of MTA and CAT project, February 2006, Table 3-6: {{cite web |url= http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |title= Archived copy |accessdate=November 4, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110108043647/http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |archivedate= January 8, 2011 }}</ref> The savings for travelers was estimated at $166 million annually in the same 2004\u20132005 time frame.<ref>[http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf Transportation Impacts of MTA and CAT project, February 2006, p. 24] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108043647/http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |date=January 8, 2011 }}</ref> Travel times on the Central Artery northbound during the afternoon peak hour were reduced 85.6%.<ref>[http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf Transportation Impacts of MTA and CAT project, February 2006, Table 3-1] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108043647/http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |date=January 8, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nA 2008 ''Boston Globe'' report asserted that waiting time for the majority of trips actually increased as a result of [[induced demand|demand induced]] by the increased road capacity.

This also forced the Turnpike Authority to release information regarding its non-disclosure of prior leaks. A follow-up reported on \"extensive\" leaks that were more severe than state authorities had previously acknowledged. The report went on to state that the $14.6 billion tunnel system was riddled with more than 400 leaks. A ''[[Boston Globe]]'' report, however, countered that by stating there were nearly 700 leaks in a single {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} section of tunnel beneath [[South Station]]. Turnpike officials also stated that the number of leaks being investigated was down from 1,000 to 500.<ref name=\"evenmorebigleaks\" />\n\nThe problem of leaks is further aggravated by the fact that many of them involve corrosive [[Seawater|salt water]]. This is caused by the proximity of [[Boston Harbor]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]], causing a mix of salt and fresh water leaks in the tunnel. The situation is made worse by [[road salt]] spread in the tunnel to melt ice during freezing weather, or brought in by vehicles passing through.<ref name=\"54m-fix\"/> Salt water and [[salt spray]] are well-known issues that must be dealt with in any [[marine environment]].

Governor [[John Volpe]] interceded in the 1950s to change the design of the last section of the Central Artery putting it underground through the [[Dewey Square Tunnel]]. While traffic moved somewhat better, the other problems remained. There was chronic congestion on the Central Artery (I-93), an elevated six-lane highway through the center of downtown Boston, which was, in the words of Pete Sigmund, \"like a funnel full of slowly-moving, or stopped, cars (and swearing motorists).\"<ref name=autogenerated3>{{Cite news |first=Pete |last=Sigmund |url=http://cegltd.com/story.asp?story=8751&headline=Triumph,%20Tragedy%20Mark%20Boston%E2%80%99s%20Big%20Dig%20Project |title=Triumph, Tragedy Mark Boston's Big Dig Project |publisher=Construction Equipment Guide |date=June 6, 2007 |accessdate=December 10, 2007 |df= }}</ref>\nIn 1959, the 1.5-mile-long (2.4&nbsp;km) road section carried approximately 75,000 vehicles a day, but by the 1990s, this had grown to 190,000 vehicles a day.

Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge|Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge]] over the Charles River under construction, looking north. The old elevated Central Artery crossing is to the right.]]\nAnother important motivation for the final form of the Big Dig was the abandonment of the Massachusetts Department of Public Works' intended expressway system through and around Boston. The Central Artery, as part of Mass. DPW's Master Plan of 1948, was originally planned to be the downtown Boston stretch of [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]], and was signed as such; a bypass road called the Inner Belt, was subsequently renamed [[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 695]]. (The law establishing the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956|Interstate highway system]] was enacted in 1956.) The [[Inner Belt District]] was to pass to the west of the downtown core, through the neighborhood of [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]] and the cities of [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], and [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]]. Earlier controversies over impact of the Boston extension of the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]], particularly on the heavily populated neighborhood of [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]], and the additional large amount of housing that would have had to be destroyed led to [[freeway and expressway revolts|massive community opposition]] to both the Inner Belt and the Boston section of I-95.<ref>{{cite web |title=Boston's Cancelled Highways |url=http://www.bostonstreetcars.com/bostons-cancelled-highways.html |website=Boston Streetcars |accessdate=January 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nBuilding demolition and land clearances for I-95 through the neighborhoods of Roxbury, [[Jamaica Plain]], and [[Roslindale]] led to secession threats by [[Hyde Park, Boston|Hyde Park]], Boston's youngest and southernmost neighborhood. By 1972, with only a minimum of work done on the I-95 right of way and none on the potentially massively disruptive Inner Belt, Governor [[Francis Sargent]] put a moratorium on highway construction within the [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route&nbsp;128]] corridor, except for the final short stretch of Interstate 93. In 1974, the remainder of the Master Plan was canceled, leaving Boston with a severely overstressed expressway system for the existing traffic.\n\nWith ever-increasing traffic volumes funneled onto I-93 alone, the Central Artery became chronically gridlocked. The Sargent moratorium led to the rerouting of I-95 away from Boston around the Route&nbsp;128 beltway and the conversion of the cleared land in the southern part of the city into the [[Southwest Corridor Park|Southwest Corridor linear park]], as well as a new right-of-way for the [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] subway and [[Amtrak]].<ref>{{cite web |title=\"Decisions Touching the Lives of All of Us\": The Plan That Changed Boston Forever |url=http://transitcenter.org/2016/06/22/massachusetts-governor-decides-transit-good-highways-bad/ |website=TransitCenter |accessdate=January 28, 2019|date=June 23, 2016 }}</ref> Parts of the planned I-695 right-of-way remain unused and under consideration for future mass-transit projects.\n\nThe original 1948 Master Plan included a Third Harbor Tunnel plan that was hugely controversial in its own right, because it would have disrupted the [[Maverick Square]] area of [[East Boston]].

Boston's Logan Airport lies across [[Boston Harbor]] in East Boston; and before the Big Dig, the only access to the airport from downtown was through the paired [[Callahan Tunnel|Callahan]] and [[Sumner Tunnel|Sumner]] tunnels. Traffic on the major highways from west of Boston\u2014the Massachusetts Turnpike and [[Storrow Drive]]\u2014mostly traveled on portions of the Central Artery to reach these tunnels. Getting between the Central Artery and the tunnels involved short diversions onto city streets, increasing local congestion.\n\n===Mass transit===\nA number of [[public transportation]] projects were included as part of an [[environmental mitigation]] for the Big Dig. The most expensive was the building of the Phase II [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]] tunnel under [[Fort Point Channel]], done in coordination with Big Dig construction. Silver Line buses now use this tunnel and the Ted Williams Tunnel to link [[South Station]] and Logan Airport.\n\n{{As of|2020}}, promised projects to extend the Green Line beyond [[Lechmere (MBTA station)|Lechmere]], to connect the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red]] and [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue]] subway lines, and to restore the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]] streetcar service to the [[Forest Hills (MBTA station)|Arborway]] in [[Jamaica Plain]] have not been completed.

Negotiations with the federal government had led to an agreement to widen some of the lanes in the new harbor tunnel, and accommodating these would require the tunnel to be deeper and mechanically-vented; this left no room for the rail lines, and having diesel trains (then in use) passing through the tunnel would have substantially increased the cost of the ventilation system.<ref name=\"Haglund2003\">{{cite book|last1=Haglund|first1=Charles|title=Inventing the Charles River|date=2003|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0262083078|page=[https://archive.org/details/inventingcharles00hagl/page/316 316]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/inventingcharles00hagl/page/316}}</ref>\n\n==Early planning==\nThe project was conceived in the 1970s by the [[Boston Transportation Planning Review]] to replace the rusting elevated six-lane Central Artery. The expressway separated downtown from the waterfront, and was increasingly choked with bumper-to-bumper traffic. Business leaders were more concerned about access to [[Logan Airport]], and pushed instead for a third harbor tunnel. In their second terms, [[Michael Dukakis]] (governor) and [[Fred Salvucci]] (secretary of transportation) came up with the strategy of tying the two projects together\u2014thereby combining the project that the business community supported with the project that they and the City of Boston supported.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nPlanning for the Big Dig as a project officially began in 1982, with environmental impact studies starting in 1983. After years of extensive lobbying for federal dollars, a 1987 public works bill appropriating funding for the Big Dig was passed by the [[Congress of the United States|US Congress]], but it was vetoed by President [[Ronald Reagan]] for being too expensive. When Congress [[Veto override|overrode]] the veto, the project had its green light and ground was first broken in 1991.<ref>Dan McNichol and Andy Ryan, ''The Big Dig''.

Eventually, MTA combined some of its employees with joint venture employees in an integrated project organization. This was intended to make management more efficient, but it hindered MTA's ability to independently oversee project activities because MTA and the joint venture had effectively become partners in the project.<ref>OIG Testimony CC-2005-027, \"Impact of Water Leaks on the Central Artery/Tunnel Project and Remaining Risks\"</ref>\n\n==Obstacles==\nIn addition to political and financial difficulties, the project faced several environmental and engineering obstacles.\nThe downtown area through which the tunnels were to be dug was largely [[Land reclamation|land fill]], and included existing [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] and [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue Line]] [[rapid transit|subway]] tunnels as well as innumerable pipes and utility lines that would have to be replaced or moved. Tunnel workers encountered many unexpected geological and archaeological barriers, ranging from glacial debris to foundations of buried houses and a number of sunken ships lying within the reclaimed land.\n\nThe project received approval from state environmental agencies in 1991, after satisfying concerns including release of toxins by the excavation and the possibility of disrupting the homes of millions of [[rat]]s, causing them to roam the streets of Boston in search of new housing.

Because the old elevated highway (which remained in operation throughout the construction process) rested on pylons located throughout the designated dig area, engineers first utilized [[slurry wall]] techniques to create {{convert|120|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} concrete walls upon which the highway could rest. These concrete walls also stabilized the sides of the site, preventing cave-ins during the continued excavation process.\n\nThe multi-lane Interstate highway also had to pass under [[South Station (MBTA)|South Station]]'s seven railway tracks, which carried over 40,000 commuters and 400 trains per day. To avoid multiple relocations of train lines while the tunneling advanced, as had been initially planned, a specially designed [[jack (device)|jack]] was constructed to support the ground and tracks to allow the excavation to take place below. Construction crews also used [[ground freezing]] (an artificial induction of [[permafrost]]) to help stabilize surrounding ground as they excavated the tunnel. This was the largest tunneling project undertaken beneath railway lines anywhere in the world. The ground freezing enabled safer, more efficient [[Earthworks (engineering)|excavation]], and also assisted in environmental issues, as less contaminated fill needed to be exported than if a traditional [[Cut-and-cover tunnel|cut-and-cover method]] had been applied.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tunnels.mottmac.com/projects/?mode=region&amp;id=3418 |title=Boston Central Artery Jacked Tunnels - Mott MacDonald Project Page |publisher=Tunnels.mottmac.com |accessdate=April 8, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408221143/https://tunnels.mottmac.com/projects/?mode=region&amp;id=3418 |archivedate=April 8, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nOther challenges included existing subway tunnels crossing the path of the underground highway. To build slurry walls past these tunnels, it was necessary to dig beneath the tunnels and to build an underground concrete bridge to support the tunnels' weight, without interrupting rail service.\n\n==Construction phase==\n[[Image:Boston-big-dig-area.png|thumb|Construction sites of the \"Big Dig\"]]\n\nThe project was managed by the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, with the Big Dig and the Turnpike's Boston Extension from the 1960s being financially and legally joined by the legislature as the [[Metropolitan Highway System]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/81a-3.htm |title=MGL Chapter 81A, Section 3 |publisher=Mass.gov |accessdate=April 8, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726222848/http://www.mass.gov//legis/laws/mgl/81a-3.htm |archivedate=July 26, 2010 }}</ref> Design and construction was supervised by a joint venture of [[Bechtel Corporation]] and [[Parsons Brinckerhoff]]. Because of the enormous size of the project\u2014too large for any company to undertake alone\u2014the design and construction of the Big Dig was broken up into dozens of smaller subprojects with well-defined interfaces between contractors. Major heavy-construction contractors on the project included [[Jay Cashman]], [[Modern Continental]], [[Obayashi Corporation]], [[Perini Building Company|Perini Corporation]], [[Peter Kiewit Sons' Incorporated]], [[J.

Many environmental advocates preferred a river crossing entirely in tunnels, but this, along with 27 other plans, was rejected as too costly. Finally, with a deadline looming to begin construction on a separate project that would connect the [[Tobin Bridge]] to the Charles River crossing, Salvucci overrode the objections and chose a variant of the plan known as \"Scheme Z\".

By the time all parties agreed on the I-93 design, construction of the Tobin connector (today known as the \"City Square Tunnel\" for a [[Charlestown, Boston, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] area it bypasses) was far along, significantly adding to the cost of constructing the [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|US Route 1]] interchange and retrofitting the tunnel. <!--Shift to active voice shortened this sentence a little, but it's still unclear whether the Rt1 work and tunnel retrofit were built, or were abandoned because of the increased cost.-->\n\nBoston blue [[clay]] and other soils extracted from the path of the tunnel were used to cap many local [[landfill]]s, fill in the [[Quincy Quarries Reservation|Granite Rail Quarry]] in [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]], and restore the surface of [[Spectacle Island (Massachusetts)|Spectacle Island]] in the [[Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area]].\n\nThe [[Storrow Drive Connector]], a companion bridge to the Zakim, began carrying traffic from I-93 to [[Storrow Drive]] in 1999.

The intent of the program was to integrate public art into highway infrastructure (retaining walls, fences, and lighting) and the essential elements of the pedestrian environment (walkways, park landscape elements, and bridges). As overall project costs increased, the Artery Arts Program was seen as a potential liability, even though there was support and interest from the public and professional arts organizations in the area.\n\nAt the beginning of the highway design process, a temporary arts program was initiated, and over 50 proposals were selected. However, development began on only a few projects before funding for the program was cut. Permanent public art that was funded includes: super graphic text and facades of former [[West End, Boston|West End]] houses cast into the concrete elevated highway abutment support walls near [[North Station]] by artist [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]]; Harbor Fog, a sensor-activated mist, light and sound sculptural environment by artist [[Ross Miller (artist)|Ross Miller]] in parcel 17; a historical sculpture celebrating the 18th and 19th century shipbuilding industry and a bust of shipbuilder [[Donald McKay]] in [[East Boston]]; blue interior lighting of the Zakim Bridge; and the [[Millers River (Middlesex)|Miller's River]] Littoral Way walkway and lighting under the loop ramps north of the [[Charles River]].\n\nExtensive landscape planting, as well as a maintenance program to support the plantings, was requested by many community members during public meetings. <!-- need more details on landscape program here -->\n\n==Impact on traffic==\n[[Image:ONeilltoZakimBridge.agr.jpg|thumb|Traffic exiting the Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Tunnel onto the Zakim Bridge.]]\nThe Big Dig untangled the co-mingled traffic from the Massachusetts Turnpike and the Sumner and Callahan tunnels. While only one net lane in each direction was added to the north\u2013south I-93, several new east\u2013west lanes became available. East\u2013west traffic on the Massachusetts Turnpike/I-90 now proceeds directly through the Ted Williams Tunnel to Logan Airport and Route 1A beyond. Traffic between Storrow Drive and the Callahan and Sumner Tunnels still uses a short portion of I-93, but additional lanes and direct connections are provided for this traffic.\n\nThe result was a 62% reduction in vehicle hours of travel on I-93, the airport tunnels, and the connection from Storrow Drive, from an average 38,200 hours per day before construction (1994\u20131995) to 14,800 hours per day in 2004\u20132005, after the project was largely complete.<ref name=impactreport>{{cite web |url= http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |title= Archived copy |accessdate=November 4, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110108043647/http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |archivedate= January 8, 2011 }} Transportation Impacts of MTA and CAT project, February 2006, Table 3-6: {{cite web |url= http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |title= Archived copy |accessdate=November 4, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110108043647/http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |archivedate= January 8, 2011 }}</ref> The savings for travelers was estimated at $166 million annually in the same 2004\u20132005 time frame.<ref>[http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf Transportation Impacts of MTA and CAT project, February 2006, p. 24] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108043647/http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |date=January 8, 2011 }}</ref> Travel times on the Central Artery northbound during the afternoon peak hour were reduced 85.6%.<ref>[http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf Transportation Impacts of MTA and CAT project, February 2006, Table 3-1] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108043647/http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |date=January 8, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nA 2008 ''Boston Globe'' report asserted that waiting time for the majority of trips actually increased as a result of [[induced demand|demand induced]] by the increased road capacity.

The report states, \"Ultimately, many motorists going to and from the suburbs at peak rush hours are spending more time stuck in traffic, not less.\" The ''Globe'' also asserted that their analysis provides a fuller picture of the traffic situation than a state-commissioned study done two years earlier, in which the Big Dig was credited with helping to save at least $167 million a year by increasing economic productivity and decreasing motor vehicle operating costs.

This also forced the Turnpike Authority to release information regarding its non-disclosure of prior leaks. A follow-up reported on \"extensive\" leaks that were more severe than state authorities had previously acknowledged. The report went on to state that the $14.6 billion tunnel system was riddled with more than 400 leaks. A ''[[Boston Globe]]'' report, however, countered that by stating there were nearly 700 leaks in a single {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} section of tunnel beneath [[South Station]]. Turnpike officials also stated that the number of leaks being investigated was down from 1,000 to 500.<ref name=\"evenmorebigleaks\" />\n\nThe problem of leaks is further aggravated by the fact that many of them involve corrosive [[Seawater|salt water]]. This is caused by the proximity of [[Boston Harbor]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]], causing a mix of salt and fresh water leaks in the tunnel. The situation is made worse by [[road salt]] spread in the tunnel to melt ice during freezing weather, or brought in by vehicles passing through.<ref name=\"54m-fix\"/> Salt water and [[salt spray]] are well-known issues that must be dealt with in any [[marine environment]]. It has been reported that \"hundreds of thousands of gallons of salt water are pumped out monthly\" in the Big Dig, and a map has been prepared showing \"hot spots\" where water leakage is especially serious.<ref name=\"CorrosionGraphic\"/> Salt-accelerated corrosion has caused ceiling light fixtures to fail (see below), but can also cause rapid deterioration of embedded [[rebar]] and other [[structural steel]] reinforcements holding the tunnel walls and ceiling in place.<ref name=\"54m-fix\"/>\n\nThe much larger than expected volume of water that must be continuously pumped consumes a correspondingly larger amount of electrical power, and will cause the pumps to wear out much sooner than originally estimated.\n\n===Substandard materials===\n{{update|section|date=December 2012|what happened after the arrests and charges}}\n[[Massachusetts State Police]] searched the offices of [[Aggregate Industries]], the largest concrete supplier for the underground portions of the project, in June 2005.
