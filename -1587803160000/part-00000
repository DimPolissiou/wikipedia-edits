By the late 11th century, the name \u2018Hindustani\u2019 was in vogue and had become the lingua franca for most of northern India. A sub-dialect called Khari Boli was spoken in and around Delhi region at the start of 13th century when the Delhi Sultanate was established. Khari Boli gradually became the prestige dialect of Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu) and became the basis of modern Standard Hindi & Urdu.}}</ref> Some linguists have suggested that the earliest forms of Urdu evolved from the medieval (6th to 13th century) [[Apabhra\u1e43\u015ba]] register of the preceding [[Shauraseni language]], a [[Middle Indo-Aryan languages|Middle Indo-Aryan language]] that is also the ancestor of other modern Indo-Aryan languages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/681263|title=Urdu's origin: it's not a 'camp language'|last=Parekh|first=Rauf|date=17 December 2011|website=DAWN.COM|language=en|access-date=1 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the Delhi region of India the native language was [[Dehlavi dialect|Khariboli]], whose earliest form is known as [[Old Hindi]].<ref name=\"Mody2008\">{{cite book |last1=Mody |first1=Sujata Sudhakar |title=Literature, Language, and Nation Formation: The Story of a Modern Hindi Journal 1900-1920 |date=2008 |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |page=7 |language=English |quote=...Hindustani, Rekhta, and Urdu as later names of the old Hindi (a.k.a.

Although it is conventional to differentiate among Persian and Arabic loan elements into Hindi/Urdu, in practice it is often difficult to separate these strands from one another. The Arabic (and also Turkic) lexemes borrowed into Hindi frequently were mediated through Persian, as a result of which a thorough intertwining of Persian and Arabic elements took place, as manifest by such phenomena as hybrid compounds and compound words. Moreover, although the dominant trajectory of lexical borrowing was from Arabic into Persian, and thence into Hindi/Urdu, examples can be found of words that in origin are actually Persian loanwords into both Arabic and Hindi/Urdu.}}</ref> In cities such as Delhi, the Indian language Old Hindi began to acquire many Persian loanwords and continued to be called \"Hindi\" and later, also \"Hindustani\" and \"Urdu\".<ref name=\"Kesavan1997\">{{cite book |last1=Kesavan |first1=B.

They paved the way for the Islamic Mughal Empire, which ruled northern India from the 16th century until it was defeated by the British Raj in the mid-19th century. It was at this time that the language of this book began to take form, a mixture of Hindvi grammar with Arabic, Persian and Turkish vocabulary.

It was only when the Muslim elites of north India and the British decided that Muslims were backward in education in relation to Hindus and should be encouraged to attend government schools that it was felt necessary to offer Urdu in the Persian-Arabic script as an inducement to Muslims to attend the schools. And it was only after the Hindi-Urdu controversy developed that Urdu, once disdained by Muslim elites in north India and not even taught in the Muslim religious schools in the early nineteenth century, became a symbol of Muslim identity second to Islam itself. A second point revealed by the Hindi-Urdu controversy in north India is how symbols may be used to separate peoples who, in fact, share aspects of culture. It is well known that ordinary Muslims and Hindus alike spoke the same language in the United Provinces in the nineteenth century, namely Hindustani, whether called by that name or whether called Hindi, Urdu, or one of the regional dialects such as Braj or Awadhi.

official language of Bihar in the 1970s.<ref name=\":18\" />\n\n== Dialects ==\nUrdu has a few recognised dialects, including [[Dakhni]], [[Dhakaiya Urdu|Dhakaiya]], [[Rekhta]], and Modern Vernacular Urdu (based on the [[Dehlavi dialect|Khariboli]] dialect of the Delhi region). [[Dakhni]] (also known as Dakani, Deccani, Desia, Mirgan) is spoken in [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] region of southern India. It is distinct by its mixture of vocabulary from [[Marathi language|Marathi]] and [[Konkani language|Konkani]], as well as some vocabulary from [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]] that are not found in the standard dialect of Urdu. Dakhini is widely spoken in all parts of [[Maharashtra]], [[Telangana]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Karnataka]]. Urdu is read and written as in other parts of India. A number of daily newspapers and several monthly magazines in Urdu are published in these states.\n\n[[Dhakaiya Urdu]] is a dialect native to the city of [[Old Dhaka]] in [[Bangladesh]], dating back to the [[Mughal era]]. However, its popularity, even amongst native speakers, has been gradually declining since the [[Bengali Language Movement]] in the 20th century. It is not officially recognised by the [[Government of Bangladesh]]. The Urdu spoken by the [[Stranded Pakistanis in Bangladesh]] is different to this dialect.\n\n=== Code switching ===\nMany bilingual or multi-lingual Urdu speakers, being familiar with both Urdu and English, display [[code-switching]] (referred to as \"[[Urdish]]\") in certain localities and between certain social groups. On 14 August 2015, the [[Government of Pakistan]] launched the ''Ilm'' Pakistan movement, with a uniform curriculum in Urdish. [[Ahsan Iqbal]], Federal Minister of Pakistan, said, \"Now the government is working on a new curriculum to provide a new medium to the students which will be the combination of both Urdu and English

are far more reliable statistics than those on population. ''Farhang-e-Asafiya'' is by general agreement the most reliable Urdu dictionary. It was compiled in the late nineteenth century by an Indian scholar little exposed to British or Orientalist scholarship. The lexicographer in question, Syed Ahmed Dehlavi, had no desire to sunder Urdu's relationship with Farsi, as is evident even from the title of his dictionary. He estimates that roughly 75 per cent of the total stock of 55,000 Urdu words that he compiled in his dictionary are derived from Sanskrit and Prakrit, and that the entire stock of the base words of the language, without exception, are derived from these sources. What distinguishes Urdu from a great many other Indian languauges ... is that it draws almost a quarter of its vocabulary from language communities to the west of India, such as Farsi, Turkish, and Tajik. Most of the little it takes from Arabic has not come directly but through Farsi.}}</ref><ref name=\"Dalmia20172\">{{cite book|title=Hindu Pasts: Women, Religion, Histories|last=Dalmia|first=Vasudha|date=31 July 2017|publisher=[[SUNY Press]]|isbn=9781438468075|page=310|language=English|quote=On the issue of vocabulary, Ahmad goes on to cite Syed Ahmad Dehlavi as he set about to compile the Farhang-e-Asafiya, an Urdu dictionary, in the late nineteenth century. Syed Ahmad 'had no desire to sunder Urdu's relationship with Farsi, as is evident from the title of his dictionary. He estimates that roughly 75 percent of the total stock of 55.000 Urdu words that he compiled in his dictionary are derived from Sanskrit and Prakrit, and that the entire stock of the base words of the language, without exception, are from these sources' (2000: 112\u201313). As Ahmad points out, Syed Ahmad, as a member of Delhi's aristocratic elite, had a clear bias towards Persian and Arabic. His estimate of the percentage of Prakitic words in Urdu should therefore be considered more conservative than not. The actual proportion of Prakitic words in everyday language would clearly be much higher.}}</ref><ref name=\"Taj19972\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~taj/abturdu.htm|title=About Hindi-Urdu|last=Taj|first=Afroz|year=1997|publisher=[[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]|language=English|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815023328/http://sasw.chass.ncsu.edu/fl/faculty/taj/hindi/abturdu.htm|archivedate=15 August 2009|accessdate=27 March 2018}}</ref> and approximately 99% of Urdu verbs have their roots in Sanskrit and Prakrit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/681263/urdus-origin-its-not-a-camp-language|title=Urdu's origin: it's not a \"camp language\"|date=17 December 2011|work=dawn.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924135247/http://www.dawn.com/news/681263/urdus-origin-its-not-a-camp-language|archivedate=24 September 2015|accessdate=5 July 2015|quote=Urdu nouns and adjective can have a variety of origins, such as Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Pushtu and even Portuguese, but ninety-nine per cent of Urdu verbs have their roots in Sanskrit/Prakrit. So it is an Indo-Aryan language which is a branch of Indo-Iranian family, which in turn is a branch of Indo-European family of languages. According to Dr Gian Chand Jain, Indo-Aryan languages had three phases of evolution beginning around 1,500 BC and passing through the stages of Vedic Sanskrit, classical Sanskrit and Pali. They developed into Prakrit and Apbhransh, which served as the basis for the formation of later local dialects.}}</ref><ref name=\"PTI19952\">{{cite book|title=India Perspectives, Volume 8|date=1995|publisher=PTI for the Ministry of External Affairs|page=23|language=English|quote=All verbs in Urdu are of Sanskrit origin.

In 1880, [[Ashley Eden|Sir Ashley Eden]], the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal abolished the use of the Persian alphabet in the law courts of [[Bengal]] and [[Bihar]] and ordered the exclusive use of [[Kaithi]], a popular script used for both Urdu and [[Hindi]].<ref>{{harvp|King|1994}}</ref> Kaithi's association with Urdu and [[Hindi]] was ultimately eliminated by the political contest between these languages and their scripts, in which the Persian script was definitively linked to Urdu.\n\nMore recently in India, Urdu speakers have adopted [[Devanagari]] for publishing Urdu periodicals and have innovated new strategies to mark Urdu in Devanagari as distinct from Hindi in Devanagari. Such publishers have introduced new orthographic features into Devanagari for the purpose of representing the Perso-Arabic etymology of Urdu words. One example is the use of \u0905 (Devanagari ''a'') with vowel signs to mimic contexts of {{Nastaliq|\u0639}} (''[[Ayin|\u2018ain]]''), in violation of Hindi orthographic rules.

However, despite its relatively late development, Urdu literature boasts of some world-recognised artists and a considerable corpus.\n\n=== Prose ===\nUrdu afsana is a kind of Urdu prose in which many experiments have been done by short story writers from Munshi Prem Chand, Sadat Hasan Manto, Rajindra Singh Bedi, Ismat Chughtai, Krishan Chandra to [[Naeem Baig]]. and [[Rahman Abbas]].\n\n==== Religious ====\nUrdu holds the largest collection of works on [[Islamic literature]] and [[Sharia]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} These include translations and interpretation of the [[Qur'an]] as well as commentary on ''[[Hadith]]'', ''[[Fiqh]]'', [[history]], and [[Sufism]]. A great number of classical texts from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] have also been translated into Urdu. Relatively inexpensive publishing, combined with the use of Urdu as a [[lingua franca]] among Muslims of [[South Asia]], has meant that Islam-related works in Urdu far outnumber such works in any other South Asian language. Popular Islamic books are also written in Urdu.\n\nA treatise on astrology was penned in Urdu by Pandit Roop Chand Joshi in the twentieth century. The book, known as [[Lal Kitab]], is widely popular in North India among astrologers.\n\n==== Literary ====\nSecular prose includes all categories of widely known fiction and non-fiction work, separable into genres. The ''d\u0101st\u0101n'', or tale, a traditional story that may have many characters and complex plotting. This has now fallen into disuse.\n\nThe ''afs\u0101na'' or [[short story]] is probably the best-known genre of Urdu fiction. The best-known ''afs\u0101na'' writers, or ''afs\u0101na nig\u0101r'', in Urdu are [[Munshi Premchand]], [[Saadat Hasan Manto]], [[Rajinder Singh Bedi]], [[Krishan Chander]], [[Qurratulain Hyder]] (Qurat-ul-Ain Haider), [[Ismat Chughtai]], [[Ghulam Abbas (writer)|Ghulam Abbas]], [[Rashid ul Khairi]] and [[Ahmad Nadeem Qasimi]] till [[Rahman Abbas]]. Towards the end of last century Paigham Afaqui's novel Makaan appeared with a reviving force for Urdu novel resulting into writing of novels getting a boost in Urdu literature and a number of writers like Ghazanfer, Abdus Samad, Sarwat Khan and Musharraf Alam Zauqi have taken the move forward. However, [[Rahman Abbas]] has emerged as the most influential Urdu Novelist in the 21st century and he has raised the art of story-telling to a new level.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/the-journey-within/article8418331.ece|title=The journey within|last1=Kidwai|first1=Shafey|date=31 March 2016|newspaper=The Hindu|accessdate=13 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nMunshi Premchand, became known as a pioneer in the ''afs\u0101na'', though some contend that his were not technically the first as Sir Ross Masood had already written many short stories in Urdu.

Other genres include ''saf\u00e9rn\u0101ma'' (travel story), ''mazmoon'' (essay), ''sarguzisht'' (account/narrative), ''inshaeya'' (satirical essay), ''murasela'' (editorial), and ''khud navvisht'' (autobiography).\n\n=== Poetry ===\n{{Main|Urdu poetry}}\n{{further|Urdu poets}}\n[[File:Mir_Taqi_Mir_1786.jpg|left|thumb|[[Mir Taqi Mir]] (1723\u20131810) ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|\u0645\u06cc\u0631 \u062a\u0642\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u0631}}}}) was the leading Urdu poet of the 18th century in the courts of [[Mughal Empire]] and [[Nawabs of Awadh]].]]\n[[File:An_illustrated_manuscript_of_one_of_Amir_Khusrau's_poems_1.jpg|right|thumb|An illustrated manuscript of one of [[Amir Khusrau]]'s (1253\u20131325 CE) [[Persian language|Persian]] poems]]\n[[File:Iqbal.jpg|right|thumb|[[Muhammad Iqbal|Allama Muhammad Iqbal]], the national poet of [[Pakistan]]]]\nUrdu has been one of the premier languages of poetry in South Asia for two centuries, and has developed a rich tradition in a variety of poetic genres. The [[Ghazal]] in Urdu represents the most popular form of subjective music and poetry, whereas the [[Nazm]] exemplifies the objective kind, often reserved for narrative, descriptive, didactic or satirical purposes. Under the broad head of the Nazm we may also include the classical forms of poems known by specific names such as [[Masnavi]] (a long narrative poem in rhyming couplets on any theme: romantic, religious, or didactic), [[Marsia]] (an elegy traditionally meant to commemorate the martyrdom of [[Husayn ibn Ali]], grandson of Muhammad, and his comrades of the [[Karbala]] fame), or [[Qasida]] (a panegyric written in praise of a king or a nobleman), for all these poems have a single presiding subject, logically developed and concluded. However, these poetic species have an old world aura about their subject and style, and are different from the modern Nazm, supposed to have come into vogue in the later part of the nineteenth century. Probably the most widely recited, and memorised genre of contemporary Urdu poetry is [[Na`at|n\u0101t]]\u2014panegyric poetry written in praise of [[Muhammad]]. ''N\u0101t'' can be of any formal category, but is most commonly in the ''ghazal'' form. The language used in Urdu ''n\u0101t'' ranges from the intensely colloquial to a highly [[Persification|persified]] formal language. The great early 20th century scholar [[Ala Hazrat]], [[Ahmed Raza Khan Barelvi]], who wrote many of the most well known ''n\u0101t''s in Urdu (the collection of his poetic work is Hadaiq-e-Baqhshish), epitomised this range in a ''ghazal'' of nine stanzas (''bayt'') in which every stanza contains half a line each of Arabic, Persian, formal Urdu, and colloquial Hindi.\n\nAnother important genre of Urdu prose are the poems commemorating the martyrdom of [[Husayn ibn Ali]] at the [[Battle of Karbala]], called [[noha]] ({{lang|ur|{{Nastaliq|\u0646\u0648\u062d\u06c1}}}}) and [[marsia]].

The very specific and detailed meter ([[Beher (poetry)|Beher]]) of a Ghazal makes the music very pleasant.\n\nSingers like Ustad Barkat Ali and many other singers in the past used to practice it, but the lack of historical records make many names anonymous. It was with [[Begum Akhtar]] and later on Ustad [[Mehdi Hassan]] that classical rendering of ghazals became popular in the masses. The categorisation of ghazal singing as a form of \"light classical\" music is a misconception.\n\nClassical ghazals are difficult to render because of the varying moods of the \"shers\" or couplets in the ghazal. [[Amanat Ali Khan]], Begum Akhtar, [[Talat Mahmood]], [[Mehdi Hassan|Ustad Mehdi Hassan]], [[Abida Parveen]], [[Jagjit Singh]], [[Farida Khanum]], and [[Ghulam Ali (Ghazal singer)|Ustad Ghulam Ali]] are popular classical ghazal singers.\n\n==== Terminologies ====\n'''''{{transl|ur|ALA-LC|As\u0331\u1e96\u02bf\u0101r}}''''' ({{lang|ur|{{Nastaliq|\u0627\u0634\u0639\u0627\u0631}}}}, verse, couplets): It consists of two hemistiches (lines) called {{transl|ur|ALA-LC|''Mi\u1e63ra\u02bf''}} ({{lang|ur|{{nq|\u0645\u0635\u0631\u0639}}}}); first hemistich (line) is called {{lang|ur|{{Nastaliq|\u0645\u0635\u0631\u0639\u0650 \u0627\u0648\u0644\u0670\u06cc}}}} (''{{transl|ur|ALA-LC|Mi\u1e63ra\u02bf-i \u016bl\u00e1}}'') and the second is called ({{lang|ur|{{Nastaliq|\u0645\u0635\u0631\u0639\u0650 \u062b\u0627\u0646\u06cc}}}}) (''{{transl|ur|ALA-LC|Mi\u1e63ra\u02bf-i s\u0331\u0101n\u012b}}'').

This can be either a part of a poet's given name or something else adopted as an identity. The traditional convention in identifying Urdu poets is to mention the {{transl|ur|ALA-LC|''ta<u>kh</u>allu\u1e63''}} at the end of the name. Thus Ghalib, whose official name and title was Mirza Asadullah Beg Khan, is referred to formally as Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib, or in common parlance as just Mirza Ghalib. Because the {{transl|ur|ALA-LC|''ta<u>kh</u>allu\u1e63''}} can be a part of their actual name, some poets end up having that part of their name repeated, such as Faiz Ahmad Faiz.\n\nThe word {{transl|ur|ALA-LC|''ta<u>kh</u>allu\u1e63''}} is derived from Arabic, meaning \"ending\". This is because in the ghazal form, the poet would usually incorporate his or her pen name into the final couplet ({{transl|ur|ALA-LC|''maqt\u0324a\u02bf''}}) of each poem as a type of \"signature\".\n\n==== Urdu poetry example ====\nThis is [[Mirza Ghalib|Ghalib]]'s famous couplet in which he compares himself to his great predecessor, the master poet [[Mir Taqi Mir|Mir]]:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ghalib/036/36_11.html?urdu|title=Columbia University: Ghazal 36, Verse 11|publisher=Columbia.edu|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111144508/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ghalib/036/36_11.html?urdu|archivedate=11 January 2012|accessdate=31 January 2012}}</ref>\n{|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |{{spaces|9}}\n|<div>{{nastaliq|\u0631\u06cc\u062e\u062a\u06c1 \u06a9\u06d2 \u062a\u064f\u0645\u06c1\u06cc\u06ba \u0627\u064f\u0633\u062a\u0627\u062f \u0646\u06c1\u06cc\u06ba \u06c1\u0648 \u063a\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0614}}</div>\n| rowspan=\"2\" |{{spaces|9}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" |<div>{{lang|ur|{{nq|\u060e}}}}</div>\n|-\n|<div>{{nastaliq|\u06a9\u06c1\u062a\u06d2 \u06c1\u06cc\u06ba \u0627\u06af\u0644\u06d2 \u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06d2 \u0645\u06cc\u06ba \u06a9\u0648\u0626\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0614 \u0628\u06be\u06cc \u062a\u06be\u0627}}</div>\n|}\n\n===== Transliteration =====\n\n: ''{{transl|ur|Re\u1e35\u1e96tah ke tumh\u012b ust\u0101d nah\u012b\u1e49 ho G\u0331\u1e96\u0101lib}}''\n: ''{{transl|ur|Kahte hai\u1e49 Agle zam\u0101ne me\u1e49 ko'\u012b M\u012br bh\u012b th\u0101}}''\n\n===== Translation =====\n\n: You are not the only master of ''[[Rekhta]]'',<ref group=\"note\">[[Rekhta]] was the name for the Urdu language in Ghalib's days.</ref> Ghalib\n: (They) say that in the past there also was someone (named) Mir.\n\n== Sample text ==\n{{see also|Hindi#Sample text}}The following is a sample text in Urdu, of the Article 1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (by the [[United Nations]]):\n\n=== Urdu text ===\n<div>\n: {{lang|ur|{{Nastaliq|'''\u062f\u0641\u0639\u06c1 \u06f1:''' \u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0622\u0632\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0648\u0631 \u062d\u064f\u0642\u064f\u0648\u0642 \u0648 \u0639\u0650\u0632\u062a \u06a9\u06d2 \u0627\u0639\u0650\u062a\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0633\u06d2 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0631 \u067e\u06cc\u062f\u0627 \u06c1\u0648\u0626\u06d2 \u06c1\u06cc\u06ba\u06d4 \u0627\u064f\u0646\u06c1\u06cc\u06ba \u0636\u0645\u06cc\u0631 \u0627\u0648\u0631 \u0639\u0642\u0644 \u0648\u062f\u06cc\u0639\u062a \u06c1\u0648\u0626\u06cc \u06c1\u06d2\u06d4 \u0627\u0650\u0633 \u0644\u06cc\u06d2 \u0627\u064f\u0646\u06c1\u06cc\u06ba \u0627\u06cc\u06a9 \u062f\u0648\u064f\u0633\u0631\u06d2 \u06a9\u06d2 \u0633\u0627\u062a\u06be \u0628\u06be\u0627\u0626\u06cc \u0686\u0627\u0631\u06d2 \u06a9\u0627 \u0633\u064f\u0644\u064f\u0648\u06a9 \u06a9\u0631\u0646\u0627 \u0686\u0627\u06c1\u0626\u06d2\u06d4}}}}\n</div><!--Nagari does not have any bearing; it is ''not'' an official script for Urdu, even in India; it is only used to transcribe poetry etc. marketed toward the Hindi-speaking population.

Its first major folk poet was the great Persian master, Amir Khusrau (1253\u20131325), who is known to have composed dohas (couplets) and riddles in the newly-formed speech, then called \u2018Hindavi\u2019. Through the medieval time, this mixed speech was variously called by various speech sub-groups as \u2018Hindavi\u2019, \u2018Zaban-e-Hind\u2019, \u2018Hindi\u2019, \u2018Zaban-e-Dehli\u2019, \u2018Rekhta\u2019, \u2018Gujari\u2019. \u2018Dakkhani\u2019, Zaban-e-Urdu-e-Mualla\u2019, \u2018Zaban-e-Urdu\u2019, or just \u2018Urdu\u2019. By the late 11th century, the name \u2018Hindustani\u2019 was in vogue and had become the lingua franca for most of northern India. A sub-dialect called Khari Boli was spoken in and around Delhi region at the start of 13th century when the Delhi Sultanate was established. Khari Boli gradually became the prestige dialect of Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu) and became the basis of modern Standard Hindi & Urdu.}}</ref> Some linguists have suggested that the earliest forms of Urdu evolved from the medieval (6th to 13th century) [[Apabhra\u1e43\u015ba]] register of the preceding [[Shauraseni language]], a [[Middle Indo-Aryan languages|Middle Indo-Aryan language]] that is also the ancestor of other modern Indo-Aryan languages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/681263|title=Urdu's origin: it's not a 'camp language'|last=Parekh|first=Rauf|date=17 December 2011|website=DAWN.COM|language=en|access-date=1 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the Delhi region of India the native language was [[Dehlavi dialect|Khariboli]], whose earliest form is known as [[Old Hindi]].<ref name=\"Mody2008\">{{cite book |last1=Mody |first1=Sujata Sudhakar |title=Literature, Language, and Nation Formation: The Story of a Modern Hindi Journal 1900-1920 |date=2008 |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |page=7 |language=English |quote=...Hindustani, Rekhta, and Urdu as later names of the old Hindi (a.k.a.

Conversational registers of Hindi/Urdu (not to mentioned formal registers of Urdu) employ large numbers of Persian and Arabic loanwords, although in Sanskritized registers many of these words are replaced by ''tatsama'' forms from Sanskrit. The Persian and Arabic lexical elements in Hindi result from the effects of centuries of Islamic administrative rule over much of north India in the centuries before the establishment of British rule in India. Although it is conventional to differentiate among Persian and Arabic loan elements into Hindi/Urdu, in practice it is often difficult to separate these strands from one another. The Arabic (and also Turkic) lexemes borrowed into Hindi frequently were mediated through Persian, as a result of which a thorough intertwining of Persian and Arabic elements took place, as manifest by such phenomena as hybrid compounds and compound words. Moreover, although the dominant trajectory of lexical borrowing was from Arabic into Persian, and thence into Hindi/Urdu, examples can be found of words that in origin are actually Persian loanwords into both Arabic and Hindi/Urdu.}}</ref> In cities such as Delhi, the Indian language Old Hindi began to acquire many Persian loanwords and continued to be called \"Hindi\" and later, also \"Hindustani\" and \"Urdu\".<ref name=\"Kesavan1997\">{{cite book |last1=Kesavan |first1=B.

It's also one of the official languages of the Indian states of Bihar and Jammu & Kashmir. Considered as one, these tongues constitute the second most spoken language in the world, sometimes called Hindustani. In their daily lives, Hindi and Urdu speakers communicate in their 'different' languages without major problems. ... Both Hindi and Urdu developed from Classical Sanskrit, which appeared in the Indus Valley (modern Pakistan and northwest India) at about the start of the Common Era. The first old Hindi (or Apabhransha) poetry was written in the year 769 AD, and by the European Middle Ages it became known as 'Hindvi'. Muslim Turks invaded the Punjab in 1027 and took control of Delhi in 1193. They paved the way for the Islamic Mughal Empire, which ruled northern India from the 16th century until it was defeated by the British Raj in the mid-19th century. It was at this time that the language of this book began to take form, a mixture of Hindvi grammar with Arabic, Persian and Turkish vocabulary. The Muslim speakers of Hindvi began to write in the Arabic script, creating Urdu, while the Hindu population incorporated the new words but continued to write in Devanagari script.}}</ref> \u2013 which was developed as a style of Persian calligraphy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Islam|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1977|isbn=0-521-29138-0|editor-last=Holt|editor-first=P.

It was only when the Muslim elites of north India and the British decided that Muslims were backward in education in relation to Hindus and should be encouraged to attend government schools that it was felt necessary to offer Urdu in the Persian-Arabic script as an inducement to Muslims to attend the schools. And it was only after the Hindi-Urdu controversy developed that Urdu, once disdained by Muslim elites in north India and not even taught in the Muslim religious schools in the early nineteenth century, became a symbol of Muslim identity second to Islam itself. A second point revealed by the Hindi-Urdu controversy in north India is how symbols may be used to separate peoples who, in fact, share aspects of culture. It is well known that ordinary Muslims and Hindus alike spoke the same language in the United Provinces in the nineteenth century, namely Hindustani, whether called by that name or whether called Hindi, Urdu, or one of the regional dialects such as Braj or Awadhi.

are far more reliable statistics than those on population. ''Farhang-e-Asafiya'' is by general agreement the most reliable Urdu dictionary. It was compiled in the late nineteenth century by an Indian scholar little exposed to British or Orientalist scholarship. The lexicographer in question, Syed Ahmed Dehlavi, had no desire to sunder Urdu's relationship with Farsi, as is evident even from the title of his dictionary.

Such publishers have introduced new orthographic features into Devanagari for the purpose of representing the Perso-Arabic etymology of Urdu words.

However, despite its relatively late development, Urdu literature boasts of some world-recognised artists and a considerable corpus.\n\n=== Prose ===\nUrdu afsana is a kind of Urdu prose in which many experiments have been done by short story writers from Munshi Prem Chand, Sadat Hasan Manto, Rajindra Singh Bedi, Ismat Chughtai, Krishan Chandra to [[Naeem Baig]]. and [[Rahman Abbas]].\n\n==== Religious ====\nUrdu holds the largest collection of works on [[Islamic literature]] and [[Sharia]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} These include translations and interpretation of the [[Qur'an]] as well as commentary on ''[[Hadith]]'', ''[[Fiqh]]'', [[history]], and [[Sufism]]. A great number of classical texts from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] have also been translated into Urdu. Relatively inexpensive publishing, combined with the use of Urdu as a [[lingua franca]] among Muslims of [[South Asia]], has meant that Islam-related works in Urdu far outnumber such works in any other South Asian language. Popular Islamic books are also written in Urdu.\n\nA treatise on astrology was penned in Urdu by Pandit Roop Chand Joshi in the twentieth century. The book, known as [[Lal Kitab]], is widely popular in North India among astrologers.\n\n==== Literary ====\nSecular prose includes all categories of widely known fiction and non-fiction work, separable into genres. The ''d\u0101st\u0101n'', or tale, a traditional story that may have many characters and complex plotting. This has now fallen into disuse.\n\nThe ''afs\u0101na'' or [[short story]] is probably the best-known genre of Urdu fiction. The best-known ''afs\u0101na'' writers, or ''afs\u0101na nig\u0101r'', in Urdu are [[Munshi Premchand]], [[Saadat Hasan Manto]], [[Rajinder Singh Bedi]], [[Krishan Chander]], [[Qurratulain Hyder]] (Qurat-ul-Ain Haider), [[Ismat Chughtai]], [[Ghulam Abbas (writer)|Ghulam Abbas]], [[Rashid ul Khairi]] and [[Ahmad Nadeem Qasimi]] till [[Rahman Abbas]]. Towards the end of last century Paigham Afaqui's novel Makaan appeared with a reviving force for Urdu novel resulting into writing of novels getting a boost in Urdu literature and a number of writers like Ghazanfer, Abdus Samad, Sarwat Khan and Musharraf Alam Zauqi have taken the move forward. However, [[Rahman Abbas]] has emerged as the most influential Urdu Novelist in the 21st century and he has raised the art of story-telling to a new level.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/the-journey-within/article8418331.ece|title=The journey within|last1=Kidwai|first1=Shafey|date=31 March 2016|newspaper=The Hindu|accessdate=13 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nMunshi Premchand, became known as a pioneer in the ''afs\u0101na'', though some contend that his were not technically the first as Sir Ross Masood had already written many short stories in Urdu.

Other genres include ''saf\u00e9rn\u0101ma'' (travel story), ''mazmoon'' (essay), ''sarguzisht'' (account/narrative), ''inshaeya'' (satirical essay), ''murasela'' (editorial), and ''khud navvisht'' (autobiography).\n\n=== Poetry ===\n{{Main|Urdu poetry}}\n{{further|Urdu poets}}\n[[File:Mir_Taqi_Mir_1786.jpg|left|thumb|[[Mir Taqi Mir]] (1723\u20131810) ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|\u0645\u06cc\u0631 \u062a\u0642\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u0631}}}}) was the leading Urdu poet of the 18th century in the courts of [[Mughal Empire]] and [[Nawabs of Awadh]].]]\n[[File:An_illustrated_manuscript_of_one_of_Amir_Khusrau's_poems_1.jpg|right|thumb|An illustrated manuscript of one of [[Amir Khusrau]]'s (1253\u20131325 CE) [[Persian language|Persian]] poems]]\n[[File:Iqbal.jpg|right|thumb|[[Muhammad Iqbal|Allama Muhammad Iqbal]], the national poet of [[Pakistan]]]]\nUrdu has been one of the premier languages of poetry in South Asia for two centuries, and has developed a rich tradition in a variety of poetic genres. The [[Ghazal]] in Urdu represents the most popular form of subjective music and poetry, whereas the [[Nazm]] exemplifies the objective kind, often reserved for narrative, descriptive, didactic or satirical purposes. Under the broad head of the Nazm we may also include the classical forms of poems known by specific names such as [[Masnavi]] (a long narrative poem in rhyming couplets on any theme: romantic, religious, or didactic), [[Marsia]] (an elegy traditionally meant to commemorate the martyrdom of [[Husayn ibn Ali]], grandson of Muhammad, and his comrades of the [[Karbala]] fame), or [[Qasida]] (a panegyric written in praise of a king or a nobleman), for all these poems have a single presiding subject, logically developed and concluded. However, these poetic species have an old world aura about their subject and style, and are different from the modern Nazm, supposed to have come into vogue in the later part of the nineteenth century. Probably the most widely recited, and memorised genre of contemporary Urdu poetry is [[Na`at|n\u0101t]]\u2014panegyric poetry written in praise of [[Muhammad]]. ''N\u0101t'' can be of any formal category, but is most commonly in the ''ghazal'' form. The language used in Urdu ''n\u0101t'' ranges from the intensely colloquial to a highly [[Persification|persified]] formal language. The great early 20th century scholar [[Ala Hazrat]], [[Ahmed Raza Khan Barelvi]], who wrote many of the most well known ''n\u0101t''s in Urdu (the collection of his poetic work is Hadaiq-e-Baqhshish), epitomised this range in a ''ghazal'' of nine stanzas (''bayt'') in which every stanza contains half a line each of Arabic, Persian, formal Urdu, and colloquial Hindi.\n\nAnother important genre of Urdu prose are the poems commemorating the martyrdom of [[Husayn ibn Ali]] at the [[Battle of Karbala]], called [[noha]] ({{lang|ur|{{Nastaliq|\u0646\u0648\u062d\u06c1}}}}) and [[marsia]]. [[Mir Babar Ali Anis|Anees]] and [[Mirza Salaamat Ali Dabeer|Dabeer]] are famous in this regard.\n\n[[Gulzar]], [[Javed Akhtar]], [[Majrooh Sultanpuri]], [[Faiz Ahmad Faiz]], [[Ahmad Faraz]], [[Jaun Elia]], [[Rahat Indori]] and [[Wasim Barelvi|Waseem Barelvi]] are some famous and widely read Urdu poets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rekhta.org/Poets/gulzar/all|title=Read famous Poetry of Gulzar|website=Rekhta|access-date=16 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rekhta.org/Poets/javed-akhtar/all|title=Read famous Poetry of Javed Akhtar|website=Rekhta|access-date=16 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rekhta.org/Poets/majrooh-sultanpuri/all|title=Read famous Poetry of Majrooh Sultanpuri|website=Rekhta|access-date=16 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rekhta.org/Poets/faiz-ahmad-faiz/all|title=Read famous Poetry of Faiz Ahmad Faiz|website=Rekhta|access-date=16 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rekhta.org/Poets/ahmad-faraz/all|title=Read famous Poetry of Ahmad Faraz|website=Rekhta|access-date=16 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rekhta.org/Poets/jaun-eliya/all|title=Read famous Poetry of Jaun Eliya|website=Rekhta|access-date=16 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rekhta.org/Poets/rahat-indori/all|title=Read famous Poetry of Rahat Indori|website=Rekhta|access-date=16 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rekhta.org/Poets/waseem-barelvi/all|title=Read famous Poetry of Waseem Barelvi|website=Rekhta|access-date=16 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n'''Music'''\n\nGhazal \"Gayaki\", the art of singing or performing the ghazal in the Indian classical tradition, is very old. The very specific and detailed meter ([[Beher (poetry)|Beher]]) of a Ghazal makes the music very pleasant.\n\nSingers like Ustad Barkat Ali and many other singers in the past used to practice it, but the lack of historical records make many names anonymous. It was with [[Begum Akhtar]] and later on Ustad [[Mehdi Hassan]] that classical rendering of ghazals became popular in the masses. The categorisation of ghazal singing as a form of \"light classical\" music is a misconception.\n\nClassical ghazals are difficult to render because of the varying moods of the \"shers\" or couplets in the ghazal. [[Amanat Ali Khan]], Begum Akhtar, [[Talat Mahmood]], [[Mehdi Hassan|Ustad Mehdi Hassan]], [[Abida Parveen]], [[Jagjit Singh]], [[Farida Khanum]], and [[Ghulam Ali (Ghazal singer)|Ustad Ghulam Ali]] are popular classical ghazal singers.\n\n==== Terminologies ====\n'''''{{transl|ur|ALA-LC|As\u0331\u1e96\u02bf\u0101r}}''''' ({{lang|ur|{{Nastaliq|\u0627\u0634\u0639\u0627\u0631}}}}, verse, couplets): It consists of two hemistiches (lines) called {{transl|ur|ALA-LC|''Mi\u1e63ra\u02bf''}} ({{lang|ur|{{nq|\u0645\u0635\u0631\u0639}}}}); first hemistich (line) is called {{lang|ur|{{Nastaliq|\u0645\u0635\u0631\u0639\u0650 \u0627\u0648\u0644\u0670\u06cc}}}} (''{{transl|ur|ALA-LC|Mi\u1e63ra\u02bf-i \u016bl\u00e1}}'') and the second is called ({{lang|ur|{{Nastaliq|\u0645\u0635\u0631\u0639\u0650 \u062b\u0627\u0646\u06cc}}}}) (''{{transl|ur|ALA-LC|Mi\u1e63ra\u02bf-i s\u0331\u0101n\u012b}}''). Each verse embodies a single thought or subject (singular) {{lang|ur|{{Nastaliq|\u0634\u0650\u0639\u0631}}}} ''[[Sher (poem)|{{transl|ur|ALA-LC|<u>sh</u>i\u02bfr}}]]''.\n\nIn the Urdu poetic tradition, most poets use a pen name called the {{transl|ur|ALA-LC|''ta<u>kh</u>allu\u1e63''}}. This can be either a part of a poet's given name or something else adopted as an identity. The traditional convention in identifying Urdu poets is to mention the {{transl|ur|ALA-LC|''ta<u>kh</u>allu\u1e63''}} at the end of the name. Thus Ghalib, whose official name and title was Mirza Asadullah Beg Khan, is referred to formally as Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib, or in common parlance as just Mirza Ghalib. Because the {{transl|ur|ALA-LC|''ta<u>kh</u>allu\u1e63''}} can be a part of their actual name, some poets end up having that part of their name repeated, such as Faiz Ahmad Faiz.\n\nThe word {{transl|ur|ALA-LC|''ta<u>kh</u>allu\u1e63''}} is derived from Arabic, meaning \"ending\". This is because in the ghazal form, the poet would usually incorporate his or her pen name into the final couplet ({{transl|ur|ALA-LC|''maqt\u0324a\u02bf''}}) of each poem as a type of \"signature\".\n\n==== Urdu poetry example ====\nThis is [[Mirza Ghalib|Ghalib]]'s famous couplet in which he compares himself to his great predecessor, the master poet [[Mir Taqi Mir|Mir]]:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ghalib/036/36_11.html?urdu|title=Columbia University: Ghazal 36, Verse 11|publisher=Columbia.edu|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111144508/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ghalib/036/36_11.html?urdu|archivedate=11 January 2012|accessdate=31 January 2012}}</ref>\n{|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |{{spaces|9}}\n|<div>{{nastaliq|\u0631\u06cc\u062e\u062a\u06c1 \u06a9\u06d2 \u062a\u064f\u0645\u06c1\u06cc\u06ba \u0627\u064f\u0633\u062a\u0627\u062f \u0646\u06c1\u06cc\u06ba \u06c1\u0648 \u063a\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0614}}</div>\n| rowspan=\"2\" |{{spaces|9}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" |<div>{{lang|ur|{{nq|\u060e}}}}</div>\n|-\n|<div>{{nastaliq|\u06a9\u06c1\u062a\u06d2 \u06c1\u06cc\u06ba \u0627\u06af\u0644\u06d2 \u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06d2 \u0645\u06cc\u06ba \u06a9\u0648\u0626\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0614 \u0628\u06be\u06cc \u062a\u06be\u0627}}</div>\n|}\n\n===== Transliteration =====\n\n: ''{{transl|ur|Re\u1e35\u1e96tah ke tumh\u012b ust\u0101d nah\u012b\u1e49 ho G\u0331\u1e96\u0101lib}}''\n: ''{{transl|ur|Kahte hai\u1e49 Agle zam\u0101ne me\u1e49 ko'\u012b M\u012br bh\u012b th\u0101}}''\n\n===== Translation =====\n\n: You are not the only master of ''[[Rekhta]]'',<ref group=\"note\">[[Rekhta]] was the name for the Urdu language in Ghalib's days.</ref> Ghalib\n: (They) say that in the past there also was someone (named) Mir.\n\n== Sample text ==\n{{see also|Hindi#Sample text}}The following is a sample text in Urdu, of the Article 1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (by the [[United Nations]]):\n\n=== Urdu text ===\n<div>\n: {{lang|ur|{{Nastaliq|'''\u062f\u0641\u0639\u06c1 \u06f1:''' \u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0622\u0632\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0648\u0631 \u062d\u064f\u0642\u064f\u0648\u0642 \u0648 \u0639\u0650\u0632\u062a \u06a9\u06d2 \u0627\u0639\u0650\u062a\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0633\u06d2 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0631 \u067e\u06cc\u062f\u0627 \u06c1\u0648\u0626\u06d2 \u06c1\u06cc\u06ba\u06d4 \u0627\u064f\u0646\u06c1\u06cc\u06ba \u0636\u0645\u06cc\u0631 \u0627\u0648\u0631 \u0639\u0642\u0644 \u0648\u062f\u06cc\u0639\u062a \u06c1\u0648\u0626\u06cc \u06c1\u06d2\u06d4 \u0627\u0650\u0633 \u0644\u06cc\u06d2 \u0627\u064f\u0646\u06c1\u06cc\u06ba \u0627\u06cc\u06a9 \u062f\u0648\u064f\u0633\u0631\u06d2 \u06a9\u06d2 \u0633\u0627\u062a\u06be \u0628\u06be\u0627\u0626\u06cc \u0686\u0627\u0631\u06d2 \u06a9\u0627 \u0633\u064f\u0644\u064f\u0648\u06a9 \u06a9\u0631\u0646\u0627 \u0686\u0627\u06c1\u0626\u06d2\u06d4}}}}\n</div><!--Nagari does not have any bearing; it is ''not'' an official script for Urdu, even in India; it is only used to transcribe poetry etc. marketed toward the Hindi-speaking population.

Calling universal suffrage universal, without children voting, is akin to calling universal suffrage universal when women couldn't vote.  Indeed, many of the same arguments were used against women voting as for children (e.g. women/children will just vote the same way as their husband/parent,  they don't understand the issues, etc.).<ref>Shirley Roberts, ''Sophia Jex-Blake: A Woman Pioneer in Nineteenth Century Medical Reform'' (Routledge, 1993), p. 1: \"Although political reformers from [[John Wilkes]] onward had pressed for 'universal adult franchise' they and their followers all understood the term to mean 'universal 'male suffrage.'\"</ref><ref>Robert Justin Goldstein, ''Political Repression in 19th Century Europe'' (Routledge, 1983): \"the great majority of European countries adopted highly discriminatory suffrage systems for lower legislative chambers for most or all of the 1815-1915 period. Universal male suffrage (which is what was meant when universal suffrage was discussed) at age 21 would have enfranchised about 25 per cent of the European population during the nineteenth century.\"</ref>\n\nThere are variations among countries in terms of specifics of the right to vote; the minimum age is usually between 18 and 25 years (see [[age of majority]]) and \"the insane, certain classes of convicted criminals, and those punished for certain electoral offenses\" sometimes lack the right to vote.<ref name=\"Brit\"/>\n\nIn most countries, universal adult suffrage (the right to vote but not necessarily the right to be a candidate) followed about a generation after universal male franchise. Notable exceptions in Europe were France, where women could not vote until 1944, Greece (1952), and Switzerland (1971).\n\nIn the first modern [[democracies]], governments restricted the vote to those with property and wealth, which almost always meant a minority of the male population. In some jurisdictions, other restrictions existed, such as requiring voters to practice a given religion. In all modern democracies, the number of people who could vote has increased progressively with time. In the 19th century in Europe, Great Britain and North America, there were movements advocating \"universal [male] suffrage\".\n\nIn the [[United States]], after the principle of \"[[one man, one vote]]\" was established in the early 1960s by [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] under [[Earl Warren]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/21/nyregion/one-man-one-vote-decades-of-court-decisions.html|title=One Man, One Vote: Decades of Court Decisions|last=Goldman|first=Ari L.|date=1986-11-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-01-14|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/1370/earl-warren|title=Earl Warren|last=Pederson|first=William D.|website=www.mtsu.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref> the [[U.S. Congress]] together with the [[Warren Court]] continued to protect and expand the [[Voting rights in the United States|voting rights of all Americans]], especially [[African Americans]], through [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] and several Supreme Court rulings.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/civilrights/prize.htm|title=We Shall Overcome -- The Players|website=www.nps.gov|access-date=2019-10-05}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1965/48|title=Harper v.

In 1867 Germany (the [[North German Confederation]]) enacted suffrage for all adult males. In the United States following the [[American Civil War]], slaves were freed and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States|granted rights of citizens]], including [[Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States|suffrage for adult males]] (although several states established restrictions largely, though not completely, diminishing these rights). In the late-19th and early-20th centuries, the focus of the [[Women's suffrage|universal suffrage movement]] came to include the extension of the [[Women's suffrage|right to vote to women]], as happened from the post-Civil War era in several Western [[state (disambiguation)|states]] and during the 1890s in a number of British colonies.\n\nOn 19 September 1893 the British Governor of New Zealand, [[David Boyle, 7th Earl of Glasgow|Lord Glasgow]], gave assent to a new electoral act, which meant that [[New Zealand]] became the first British-controlled colony in which women had the right to vote in parliamentary elections.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/womens-suffrage|title= new zealand women and the vote|website= nzhistory.govt.nz|accessdate= 2019-06-30}}</ref> This was followed shortly after by the colony of [[South Australia]] in 1894, which was the second to allow women to vote, but the first colony to permit women to stand for election as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/womens-suffrage|title=Women\u2019s suffrage|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=2019-12-01}}</ref> Twelve years later, the autonomous Russian territory known as [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] (which became the Republic of Finland in 1917) became the first territory in the world to implement unrestricted universal suffrage, as women could stand as candidates, unlike in New Zealand, and without indigenous ethnic exclusion, like in Australia.

For this reason, Australia (1901), New Zealand (1908) and Finland (1917) all have different dates of achieving independent nationhood.\n\nThe [[First French Republic]] adopted universal male suffrage briefly in 1792; it was one of the first national systems that abolished all property requirements as a prerequisite for allowing men to register and vote. Greece recognized full male suffrage in 1844.<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/place/Greece/Building-the-nation-1832-1913#ref297975 Greece - Encyclopedia Britannica]</ref> Spain recognized it in the [[Constitution of 1869]] and France and Switzerland have continuously done so since the [[1848 Revolution]] (for resident male citizens). Upon independence in the 19th century, several Latin-American countries and Liberia in Africa initially extended suffrage to all adult males, but subsequently restricted it based on property requirements. The [[German Empire]] implemented full male suffrage in 1871.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iub.edu/~paris10/ParisOSS/Day10_Sex_and_Gender/d7_Offen.html|title=Karen Offen, \u201cWomen, Citizenship, and Suffrage in France Since 1789\u201d|last=|first=|date=|website=www.iub.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], ratified in 1870 during the [[Reconstruction era]], provided that \"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\" This amendment aimed to guarantee the right to vote to [[African Americans]], many of whom had been [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved]] in the [[Southern United States|South]] prior to the end (1865) of the [[American Civil War]] and the 1864-1865 [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|abolition of slavery]].

For example, in [[apartheid]]-era [[South Africa]], non-[[white people]] could generally not vote in national elections until the first [[1994 South African general election|multi-party elections in 1994]] (except under the [[Cape Qualified Franchise]], which was replaced by a number of [[Coloured vote constitutional crisis|separate MPs]] in 1936 (Blacks) and 1958 (Coloureds), later by the [[Tricameral Parliament]]). Rhodesia enacted a similar statute in [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|its proclaimed independence]] of 1965, which however allowed a smaller number of representatives for the considerably larger Black majority (under its 1961 constitution, the voting classes had been based on socio-economic standards, which marginalized most Black and a few White voters to a separate set of constituencies, under the principle of [[weighted voting]]; this was replaced in 1969 by an openly racial franchise, with delegated all Blacks to the 'B' voters roll).\n\n==Dates by country==\nStates have granted and revoked universal suffrage at various times.

In 1867 Germany (the [[North German Confederation]]) enacted suffrage for all adult males. In the United States following the [[American Civil War]], slaves were freed and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States|granted rights of citizens]], including [[Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States|suffrage for adult males]] (although several states established restrictions largely, though not completely, diminishing these rights).

Assisted by highly successful [[field Marshals of Russia|generals]] such as [[Alexander Suvorov]] and [[Pyotr Rumyantsev]], and [[list of Russian Admirals|admirals]] such as [[Fyodor Ushakov]], she governed at a time when the Russian Empire was expanding rapidly by conquest and diplomacy. In the south, the [[Crimean Khanate]] was crushed following victories over the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the [[Russo-Turkish wars]], and Russia colonised the territories of [[Novorossiya]] along the coasts of the [[Black Sea|Black]] and [[Azov Sea]]s. In the west, the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], ruled by Catherine's former lover, King [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]], was eventually [[Partitions of Poland|partitioned]], with the Russian Empire gaining the largest share. In the east, Russia [[Russian colonisation of the Americas|started to colonise]] Alaska, establishing [[Russian America]].\n\nCatherine reformed the administration of Russian [[guberniya]]s, and many [[list of cities in Russia|new cities and towns]] were founded on her orders. An admirer of [[Peter the Great]], Catherine continued to modernize Russia along Western European lines. However, military conscription and the economy continued to depend on [[serfdom in Russia|serfdom]], and the increasing demands of the state and of private landowners intensified the exploitation of serf labor. This was one of the chief reasons behind several rebellions, including the large-scale [[Pugachev's Rebellion|Pugachev Rebellion]] of [[Cossacks]] and peasants.\n\nCatherine decided to have herself [[inoculation|inoculated]] against [[smallpox]] by a British doctor, [[Thomas Dimsdale]]. While this was considered a controversial method at the time, she succeeded. Her son Pavel was later inoculated as well. Catherine then sought to have inoculations throughout her empire and stated: \"My objective was, through my example, to save from death the multitude of my subjects who, not knowing the value of this technique, and frightened of it, were left in danger\".

Catherine later wrote that she stayed at one end of the castle, and Peter at the other.<ref>{{cite book|author=Streeter, Michael |title=Catherine the Great|publisher=Haus Publishing|date= 2007| page= 6}}</ref>\n\nThe diplomatic intrigue failed, largely due to the intervention of Sophie's mother, [[Johanna Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp]]. Historical accounts portray Johanna as a cold, abusive woman who loved gossip and court intrigues. Her hunger for fame centred on her daughter's prospects of becoming empress of Russia, but she infuriated Empress Elizabeth, who eventually banned her from the country for spying for [[Frederick II of Prussia|King Frederick of Prussia]]. Empress Elizabeth knew the family well: she had intended to marry Princess Johanna's brother [[Christian August of Holstein-Gottorp, Prince of Eutin#Marriage and issue|Charles Augustus]] (Karl August von Holstein), who had died of [[smallpox]] in 1727 before the wedding could take place.<ref>{{cite book| last = Huberty| first = Michel| title = L'Allemagne dynastique: Les quinze Familles qui on fait l'Empire| year = 1994| isbn=978-2-901138-07-5| page = 166 }}</ref> Despite Johanna's interference, Empress Elizabeth took a strong liking to Catherine, who, on arrival in Russia in 1744 spared no effort to ingratiate herself not only with Empress Elizabeth, but with her husband and with the [[Russians|Russian people]] as well. Catherine applied herself to learning the [[Russian language]] with zeal, rising at night and walking about her bedroom barefoot, repeating her lessons. (Even though she mastered the language, she retained an accent.) This practice led to a severe attack of [[pneumonia]] in March 1744. When she wrote her [[memoir]]s, she said she made up her mind when she came to Russia to do whatever was necessary and to profess to believe whatever was required of her, to become qualified to wear the crown.\n\n[[File:Empress Catherine The Great circa 1845 (George Christoph Grooth).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait\nof the Grand Duchess Ekaterina Alekseyevna around the time of her wedding, by George Christoph Grooth, 1745]]\n\nCatherine recalled in her memoirs that as soon as she arrived in Russia, she fell ill with a [[pleuritis]] that almost killed her. She credited her survival to frequent [[bloodletting]]; in a single day, she had four [[Phlebotomy|phlebotomies]]. Her mother, who was opposed to this practice, fell into the Empress' disfavour. When Catherine's situation looked desperate, her mother wanted her confessed by a Lutheran priest. Awaking from her [[delirium]], however, Catherine said: \"I don't want any Lutheran; I want my Orthodox father [clergyman].\" This raised her in the Empress' esteem.\n\nPrincess Sophie's father, a devout German [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], opposed his daughter's conversion to [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]]. Despite his objection, however, on 28 June 1744, the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] received Princess Sophie as a member with the new name Catherine (Yekaterina or Ekaterina) and the (artificial) [[patronymic]] \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430 (Alekseyevna, daughter of Aleksey). On the following day, the formal betrothal took place. The long-planned dynastic marriage finally occurred on 21 August 1745 in [[Saint Petersburg]]. Sophie had turned 16; her father did not travel to Russia for the wedding. The bridegroom, known then as Peter von Holstein-Gottorp, had become Duke of [[Dukes of Holstein-Gottorp|Holstein-Gottorp]] (located in the north-west of {{As of|2008 |alt=present-day}} Germany near the border with Denmark) in 1739. The newlyweds settled in the palace of [[Oranienbaum, Russia|Oranienbaum]], which remained the residence of the \"young court\" for many years to come. \n\nBored with her husband, Catherine became an avid reader of books, mostly in French.<ref>{{harvnb|Brechka|1969|pp=40}}</ref> Catherine disparaged her husband as devoted to reading \"Lutheran prayer-books, the other the history of and trial of some highway robbers who had been hung or broken on the wheel\".<ref>{{harvnb|Brechka|1969|pp=40}}</ref> It was during this period that she first read Voltaire and the other ''philosophes'' of the French Enlightenment.<ref>{{harvnb|Brechka|1969|pp=40}}</ref> As she learned Russian, she became increasingly interested in the literature of her adopted country.<ref>{{harvnb|Brechka|1969|pp=41}}</ref> Finally, she also read the Classics.

She became friends with Princess [[Yekaterina Romanovna Vorontsova-Dashkova|Ekaterina Vorontsova-Dashkova]], the sister of her husband's mistress, who introduced her to several powerful political groups that opposed her husband. \n\nPeter III's temperament became quite unbearable for those who resided in the palace. He would announce trying drills in the morning to male servants, who later joined Catherine in her room to sing and dance until late hours.\n\nCatherine became pregnant with her second child, Anna, who only lived to 14 months, in 1759. Due to various rumours of Catherine's promiscuity, Peter was led to believe  he was not the child's biological father and is known to have proclaimed, \"Go to the devil!\", when Catherine angrily dismissed his accusation. She thus spent much of this time alone in her private [[boudoir]] to hide away from Peter's abrasive personality.<ref>Sergeant, Philip W.

The imperial couple moved into the new [[Winter Palace]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. The tsar's eccentricities and policies, including a great admiration for the Prussian king, [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]], alienated the same groups that Catherine had cultivated. Russia and Prussia had fought each other during the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u20131763), and Russian troops had occupied Berlin in 1761. Peter supported Frederick II, however, eroding much of his support among the nobility. Peter ceased Russian operations against Prussia, and Frederick suggested the [[Partitions of Poland|partition of Polish territories]] with Russia. Peter also intervened in a dispute between his Duchy of [[Holstein]] and [[Denmark\u2013Norway|Denmark]] over the province of [[Duchy of Schleswig|Schleswig]] (see [[Count Johann Hartwig Ernst von Bernstorff]]). As [[Duke of Holstein-Gottorp]], Peter planned war against Denmark, Russia's traditional [[Denmark\u2013Russia relations|ally against Sweden]].\n\n[[File:Europe 1748-1766 en.png|thumb|left|Europe as of the mid-1760s]]\n[[File:Catherine03.jpg|thumb|upright|Equestrian portrait of the Grand Duchess Yekaterina Alexeyevna]]\n\nIn July 1762, barely six months after becoming emperor, Peter lingered with his Holstein-born courtiers and relatives to [[Oranienbaum, Russia|Oranienbaum]], while his wife was at a different palace nearby.

Ivan VI was assassinated during an attempt to free him as part of a failed ''coup'': like Empress Elizabeth before her, Catherine had given strict instructions that Ivan was to be killed in the event of any such attempt. [[Yelizaveta Alekseyevna Tarakanova]] (1753\u20131775) was another potential rival.\n\nAlthough Catherine did not descend from the Romanov dynasty, her ancestors included members of the [[Rurik dynasty]], which preceded the Romanovs. She succeeded her husband as [[Queen regnant|empress regnant]], following the precedent established when [[Catherine I of Russia|Catherine I]] succeeded her husband [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] in 1725. Historians debate Catherine's technical status, whether as a regent or as a [[usurper]], tolerable only during the minority of her son, [[Paul I of Russia|Grand Duke Paul]].

The Russian troops set out from [[Kizlyar]] in April 1796 [[Storming of Derbent|and stormed]] the key fortress of [[Derbent]] on 10 May. The event was glorified by the court poet [[Gavrila Derzhavin|Derzhavin]] in his famous ode; he later commented bitterly on Zubov's inglorious return from the expedition in another remarkable poem.\n\nBy mid-June, [[Prince Zubov|Zubov's]] troops overran without any resistance most of the territory of modern-day [[Azerbaijan]], including three principal cities\u2014[[Baku]], [[Shemakha]], and [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]]. By November, they were stationed at the confluence of the [[Araks]] and [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura Rivers]], poised to attack mainland [[Iran]]. In that month, the Empress of Russia died and her successor [[Paul I of Russia|Paul]], who detested that the [[Prince Zubov|Zubovs]] had other plans for the army, ordered the troops to retreat to Russia. This reversal aroused the frustration and enmity of the powerful Zubovs and other officers who took part in the campaign: many of them would be among the conspirators who arranged Paul's murder five years later.\n\n==== Relations with Western Europe ====\n{{See also|Russia in the American Revolutionary War#Russian Diplomacy during the War}}\n[[File:Taming-of-the-Shrew-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|left|A 1791 British caricature of an attempted mediation between Catherine (on the right, supported by Austria and France) and Turkey]]\n\nCatherine longed for recognition as an enlightened sovereign. She pioneered for Russia the role that Britain later played through most of the 19th and early 20th centuries as an international mediator in disputes that could, or did, lead to war. She acted as mediator in the [[War of the Bavarian Succession]] (1778\u201379) between the German states of Prussia and Austria. In 1780, she established a [[First League of Armed Neutrality|League of Armed Neutrality]], designed to defend neutral shipping from the [[Royal Navy|British Royal Navy]] during the [[American Revolution]].\n\nFrom 1788 to 1790, Russia fought a [[Russo-Swedish War (1788\u20131790)|war against Sweden]], a conflict instigated by Catherine's cousin, King [[Gustav III of Sweden]], who expected to simply overtake the Russian armies still engaged in war against the Ottoman Turks, and hoped to strike Saint Petersburg directly. But Russia's [[Baltic Fleet]] checked the Royal Swedish navy in a tied [[battle of Hogland]] (July 1788), and the Swedish army failed to advance. Denmark declared war on Sweden in 1788 (the [[Theater War|Theatre War]]). After the decisive defeat of the Russian fleet at the [[Battle of Svensksund]] in 1790, the parties signed the [[Treaty of V\u00e4r\u00e4l\u00e4]] (14 August 1790), returning all conquered territories to their respective owners and confirming the [[Treaty of \u00c5bo]]. Peace ensued for 20 years, aided by the assassination of Gustav III in 1792.\n\n==== Partitions of Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth ====\n{{Main|Partitions of Poland}}\n[[File:Rzeczpospolita Rozbiory 3.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Partitions of Poland|The partitions of Poland]], carried out by Russia, the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] in 1772, 1793 and 1795]]\nIn 1764, Catherine placed [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]], her former lover, on the [[List of Polish monarchs|Polish throne]]. Although the idea of partitioning Poland came from the King [[Frederick II of Prussia]], Catherine took a leading role in carrying it out in the 1790s. In 1768, she formally became protector of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], which provoked an [[Anti-Russian sentiment|anti-Russian]] uprising in Poland, the [[Bar Confederation|Confederation of Bar]] (1768\u201372). After the uprising broke down due to internal politics in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, she established in the ''Rzeczpospolita'', a system of government fully controlled by the Russian Empire through a [[Permanent Council]], under the supervision of her [[Ambassadors and envoys from Russia to Poland (1763\u20131794)|ambassadors and envoys]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Catherine the Great : life and legend|last=Alexander, John T.|date=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-505236-6|location=New York|oclc=17807369|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/catherinegreatli0000alex}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, Catherine rejected many principles of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] she had once viewed favourably. Afraid the [[Constitution of 3 May 1791|May Constitution of Poland]] (1791) might lead to a resurgence in the power of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth and the growing democratic movements inside the Commonwealth might become a threat to the European monarchies, Catherine decided to intervene in Poland. She provided support to a Polish anti-reform group known as the [[Targowica Confederation]]. After defeating Polish loyalist forces in the [[Polish\u2013Russian War of 1792]] and in the [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising]] (1794), Russia completed the partitioning of Poland, dividing all of the remaining Commonwealth territory with Prussia and Austria (1795).\n\n==== Relations with Japan ====\nIn the Far East, Russians became active in fur trapping in [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]] and the [[Kuril Islands]]. This spurred Russian interest in opening trade with Japan to the south for supplies and food. In 1783, storms drove a Japanese sea captain, [[Daikokuya K\u014dday\u016b]], ashore in the [[Aleutian Islands]], at that time Russian territory. Russian local authorities helped his party, and the Russian government decided to use him as a trade envoy. On 28 June 1791, Catherine granted Daikokuya an audience at [[Tsarskoye Selo]]. Subsequently, in 1792, the Russian government dispatched a trade mission to Japan, led by [[Adam Laxman]]. The [[Tokugawa shogunate]] received the mission, but negotiations failed.\n====Relations with China====\nThe [[Qianlong Emperor]] of China was committed to an expansionist policy in Central Asia and saw the Russian empire as a potential rival, making for difficult and unfriendly relations between Beijing and St. Petersburg.<ref>{{harvnb|Lim|2013|pp=55}}</ref> In 1762, he unilaterally abrogated the [[Treaty of Kyakhta (1727)|Treaty of Kyakhta]], which governed the caravan trade between the two empires.<ref>{{harvnb|Lim|2013|pp=55-56}}</ref> Another source of tension were Dzungar Mongol fugitives from the Chinese state who took refuge with the Russians.<ref>{{harvnb|Lim|2013|pp=56}}</ref> The [[Dzungar genocide]] by the Qing state had led many Dzungars to seek sanctuary in the Russian empire, and was one of the reasons for the abrogation of the Treaty of Kyakhta. Catherine perceived the Qianlong Emperor as an unpleasant and arrogant neighbor, once saying: \"I shall not die until I have ejected the Turks from Europe, suppressed the pride of China and established trade with India\".<ref>{{harvnb|Lim|2013|pp=56}}</ref> In a 1790 letter to Baron de Grimm written in French, she called the Qianlong Emperor \"''mon voisin chinois aux petits yeux''\" (\"my Chinese neighbor with small eyes\").<ref>{{harvnb|Lim|2013|pp=55}}</ref>\n\n=== Economics and finance ===\n[[File:5 Kopecks repr\u00e9sentant l'aigle bic\u00e9phale et le monogramme de Catherine II, 1791.jpg|thumb|Catherine the Great]]\n\nRussian economic development was well below the standards in western Europe. Historian Francois Cruzet writes that Russia under Catherine:\n{{quote|had neither a free peasantry, nor a significant middle class, nor legal norms hospitable to private enterprise. Still, there was a start of industry, mainly textiles around Moscow and ironworks in the Ural Mountains, with a labor force mainly of serfs, bound to the works.<ref>{{cite book|author=Fran\u00e7ois Crouzet|title=A History of the European Economy, 1000\u20132000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NiVWqSTea8oC&pg=PA75|year=2001|publisher=U of Virginia Press|page=75|isbn=978-0-8139-2190-7}}</ref>}}\n\nCatherine strongly encouraged the migration of the [[Volga Germans]], farmers from Germany who settled mostly in the Volga River Valley region. They indeed helped modernise the sector that totally dominated the Russian economy. They introduced numerous innovations regarding wheat production and flour milling, tobacco culture, sheep raising, and small-scale manufacturing.<ref>\"The Economic Contributions of the German Russians to the Imperial Russian Economy.\" ''Journal of the American Historical Society of Germans from Russia'' (2012) 35#2 pp. 1\u201334</ref><ref>Fred C. Koch, ''The Volga Germans: in Russia and the Americas, from 1763 to the present'' (Penn State Press, 2010).</ref>\n\nIn 1768, the [[:Saint Petersburg State University of Economics and Finance#Assignation Bank|Assignation Bank]] was given the task of issuing the first government paper money. It opened in St. Petersburg and Moscow in 1769. Several bank branches were afterwards established in other towns, called government towns. Paper notes were issued upon payment of similar sums in copper money, which were also refunded upon the presentation of those notes.\nThe emergence of these [[Assignation rubles]] was necessary due to large government spending on military needs, which led to a shortage of silver in the treasury (transactions, especially in foreign trade, were conducted almost exclusively in silver and gold coins). Assignation rubles circulated on equal footing with the silver ruble; a market exchange rate for these two currencies was ongoing. The use of these notes continued until 1849.<ref>James A.

The [[Hermitage Museum]], which {{As of|2009 |alt=now}} occupies the whole [[Winter Palace]], began as Catherine's personal collection. The Empress was a great lover of art and books, and ordered the construction of the Hermitage in 1770 to house her ever expanding collection of paintings, sculpture, and books.<ref>{{harvnb|Rounding|2006|pp=222}}</ref> By 1790, the Hermitage was the home to 38,000 books, 10,000 gems, 10,000 drawings and two wings devoted to her collections of \"curiosities\".<ref>{{harvnb|Brechka|1969|pp=47}}</ref> Another interest was the English style of gardens, as she ordered the first \"English garden\" planted at Tsarskoye Selo in May 1770.<ref>{{harvnb|Rounding|2006|pp=222}}</ref> In a letter to Voltaire in 1772, she wrote: \"Right now I adore English gardens, curves, gentle slopes, ponds in the form of lakes, archipelagos on dry land, and I have a profound scorn for straight lines, symmetric avenues. I hate fountains that torture water in order to make it take a course contrary to its nature: statues are relegated to galleries, vestibules etc; in a word, Anglomania is the master of my plantomania\".<ref>{{harvnb|Rounding|2006|pp=222-223}}</ref> \n\nCatherine shared in the general European craze for all things Chinese, and made a point of collecting Chinese art while buying the popular ''chinoiserie''  porcelain.<ref>{{harvnb|Lim|2013|pp=54}}</ref> Between 1762-66, she had built the \"Chinese Palace\" at Oranienbaum which reflected the ''[[chinoiserie]]'' style of architecture and gardening.<ref>{{harvnb|Lim|2013|pp=54}}</ref> The Chinese Palace was designed by the Italian architect Antonio Rinaldi who specialised in the ''chinoiserie'' style.<ref>{{harvnb|Lim|2013|pp=54}}</ref> In 1779, she hired the British architect Charles Cameron to build the Chinese Village at Tsarkoe Selo (modern Pushkin, Russia).<ref>{{harvnb|Lim|2013|pp=54}}</ref> Catherine had at first attempted to hire a Chinese architect to build the Chinese Village, and on finding that was impossible, settled on Cameron, who likewise specialised in the ''chinoiserie'' style.<ref>{{harvnb|Lim|2013|pp=54}}</ref> \n\nShe wrote comedies, fiction, and memoirs, while cultivating [[Voltaire]], [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]], and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]]\u2014all French [[Encyclop\u00e9distes|encyclopedists]] who later cemented her reputation in their writings. The leading economists of her day, such as [[Arthur Young (writer)|Arthur Young]] and [[Jacques Necker]], became foreign members of the [[Free Economic Society]], established on her suggestion in Saint Petersburg in 1765. She recruited the scientists [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Peter Simon Pallas]] from Berlin and [[Anders Johan Lexell]] from Sweden to the Russian capital.\n\nCatherine enlisted Voltaire to her cause, and corresponded with him for 15 years, from her accession to his death in 1778. He lauded her accomplishments, calling her \"The Star of the North\" and the \"[[Semiramis]] of Russia\" (in reference to the legendary Queen of [[Babylon]], a subject on which he published a tragedy in 1768). Though she never met him face to face, she mourned him bitterly when he died. She acquired his collection of books from his heirs, and placed them in the [[National Library of Russia]].\n\nCatherine read three sorts of books, namely those for pleasure, those for information and those to provide her with a philosophy.<ref>{{harvnb|Brechka|1969|pp=43}}</ref> In the first category, she read romances and comedies that were popular at the time, many of which were regarded as \"inconsequential\" by the critics both then and since.<ref>{{harvnb|Brechka|1969|pp=43}}</ref> She especially liked the work of German comic writers such as [[Moritz August von Th\u00fcmmel]] and [[Christoph Friedrich Nicolai]].<ref>{{harvnb|Brechka|1969|pp=43}}</ref> In the second category fell the work of [[Denis Diderot]], [[Jacques Necker]], [[Johann Bernhard Basedow]] and [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]].<ref>{{harvnb|Brechka|1969|pp=44}}</ref> Catherine expressed some frustration with the economists she read for what she regarded as their impractical theories, writing in the margin of one of Necker's books that if it was possible to solve all of the state's economic problems in one day, she would have done so a long time ago.<ref>{{harvnb|Brechka|1969|pp=44}}</ref> For information about particular nations that interested her, she read [[Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville]]'s ''Memoirs de Chine'' to learn about the vast and wealthy Chinese empire that bordered her empire; [[Fran\u00e7ois Baron de Tott]]'s ''Memoires de les Turcs et les Tartares'' for information about the Ottoman Empire and the Crimean khanate; the books of [[Frederick the Great]] praising himself to learn about Frederick just as much as to learn about Prussia; and the pamphlets of [[Benjamin Franklin]] denouncing the British Crown to understand the reasons for the American Revolution.<ref>{{harvnb|Brechka|1969|pp=44}}</ref> In the third category fell the work of [[Voltaire]], [[Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm]], [[Ferdinando Galiani]], [[Nicolas Baudeau]], and Sir [[William Blackstone]].<ref>{{harvnb|Brechka|1969|pp=44-45}}</ref> For philosophy, she liked books promoting what has been called \"enlightened despotism\", which she embraced as her ideal of an autocratic but reformist government that would operate according to the rule of law, not the whims of the ruler, hence her interest in Blackstone's legal commentaries.<ref>{{harvnb|Brechka|1969|pp=44-45}}</ref>            \n\nWithin a few months of her accession in 1762, having heard the French government threatened to stop the publication of the famous French ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'' on account of its irreligious spirit, Catherine proposed to Diderot that he should complete his great work in Russia under her protection.\n\nFour years later, in 1766, she endeavoured to embody in legislation the principles of Enlightenment she learned from studying the French philosophers. She called together at Moscow a Grand Commission\u2014almost a consultative parliament\u2014composed of 652 members of all classes (officials, nobles, [[Bourgeoisie|burghers]], and [[peasant]]s) and of various nationalities. The Commission had to consider the needs of the Russian Empire and the means of satisfying them. The Empress herself prepared the [[Nakaz|\"Instructions for the Guidance of the Assembly\"]], pillaging (as she frankly admitted) the philosophers of Western Europe, especially [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] and [[Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria|Cesare Beccaria]].\n\n[[File:Portrait of Empress Catherine II(a).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Catherine II]]\nAs many of the democratic principles frightened her more moderate and experienced advisors, she refrained from immediately putting them into practice. After holding more than 200 sittings, the so-called Commission dissolved without getting beyond the realm of theory.\n\nIn spite of this, Catherine began issuing codes to address some of the modernisation trends suggested in her [[Nakaz]]. In 1775, the Empress decreed a Statute for the Administration of the Provinces of the Russian Empire. The statute sought to efficiently govern Russia by increasing population and dividing the country into provinces and districts. By the end of her reign, 50 provinces and nearly 500 districts were created, government officials numbering more than double this were appointed, and spending on local government increased sixfold. In 1785, Catherine conferred on the nobility the [[Charter to the Gentry|Charter to the Nobility]], increasing further the power of the landed oligarchs. Nobles in each district elected a Marshal of the Nobility, who spoke on their behalf to the monarch on issues of concern to them, mainly economic ones. In the same year, Catherine issued the Charter of the Towns, which distributed all people into six groups as a way to limit the power of nobles and create a middle estate. Catherine also issued the Code of Commercial Navigation and Salt Trade Code of 1781, the Police Ordinance of 1782, and the Statute of National Education of 1786. In 1777, the Empress described to Voltaire her legal innovations within a backward Russia as progressing \"little by little\".\n\nDuring Catherine's reign, Russians imported and studied the classical and European influences that inspired the [[Russian Enlightenment]]. [[Gavrila Derzhavin]], [[Denis Fonvizin]], and [[Ippolit Bogdanovich]] laid the groundwork for the great writers of the 19th century, especially for [[Alexander Pushkin]]. Catherine became a great patron of [[Russian opera]]. When [[Alexander Radishchev]] published his ''[[Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow]]'' in 1790 (one year after the start of the [[French Revolution]]) and warned of uprisings because of the deplorable social conditions of the peasants held as [[serfdom|serfs]], Catherine [[exile]]d him to [[Siberia]].\n\n[[File:Bolshoy Teatr.jpg|thumb|The Bolshoi Theatre in the early 19th century]]\nCatherine also received [[Elisabeth Vig\u00e9e Le Brun]] (formerly court painter to [[Marie Antoinette]]) at her [[Tsarskoye Selo]] residence in [[St Petersburg]], by whom she was painted shortly before her death. Madame Vig\u00e9e Le Brun vividly describes the empress in her memoirs: \"the sight of this famous woman so impressed me that I found it impossible to think of anything: I could only stare at her. Firstly I was very surprised at her small stature; I had imagined her to be very tall, as great as her fame. She was also very fat, but her face was still beautiful, and she wore her white hair up, framing it perfectly. Her genius seemed to rest on her forehead, which was both high and wide. Her eyes were soft and sensitive, her nose quite Greek, her colour high and her features expressive. She addressed me immediately in a voice full of sweetness, if a little throaty: \"I am delighted to welcome you here, Madame, your reputation runs before you. I am very fond of the arts, especially painting. I am no connoisseur, but I am a great art lover.\"\n\nMadame Vig\u00e9e Le Brun also describes the empress at a gala: \"The double doors opened and the Empress appeared. I have said that she was quite small, and yet on the days when she made her public appearances, with her head held high, her eagle-like stare and a countenance accustomed to command, all this gave her such an air of majesty that to me she might have been Queen of the World; she wore the sashes of three orders, and her costume was both simple and regal; it consisted of a muslin tunic embroidered with gold fastened by a diamond belt, and the full sleeves were folded back in the Asiatic style. Over this tunic she wore a red velvet dolman with very short sleeves. The bonnet which held her white hair was not decorated with ribbons, but with the most beautiful diamonds.\"\n\n=== Education ===\nCatherine held western European philosophies and culture close to her heart, and she wanted to surround herself with like-minded people within Russia.<ref>{{harvnb|Max|2006|pp=19\u201324}}</ref> She believed a 'new kind of person' could be created by inculcating Russian children with European education. Catherine believed education could change the hearts and minds of the Russian people and turn them away from backwardness. This meant developing individuals both intellectually and morally, providing them knowledge and skills, and fostering a sense of civic responsibility.<ref>Nicholas V. Riasanovsky, ''A History of Russia'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2011).</ref>\n\n[[File:E. Vorontsova-Dashkova by Dm. Levitsky (1784, Hillwood).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Yekaterina Vorontsova-Dashkova]], the closest female friend of Empress Catherine and a major figure of the Russian Enlightenment]]\n\nCatherine appointed [[Ivan Betskoy]] as her advisor on educational matters.<ref>{{harvnb|Madariaga|1979|pp=369\u201395}}</ref> Through him, she collected information from Russia and other countries about educational institutions. She also established a commission composed of T.N. Teplov, T. von Klingstedt, F.G. Dilthey, and the historian G. Muller. She consulted British education pioneers, particularly the Rev. [[Daniel Dumaresq]] and Dr John Brown.<ref>N. Hans, \"Dumaresq, Brown and Some Early Educational Projects of Catherine II\", ''Slavonic and East European Review'' (1961) : 229\u201335.</ref> In 1764, she sent for Dumaresq to come to Russia and then appointed him to the educational commission. The commission studied the reform projects previously installed by I.I. Shuvalov under Elizabeth and under Peter III. They submitted recommendations for the establishment of a general system of education for all Russian orthodox subjects from the age of 5 to 18, excluding serfs.<ref>{{harvnb|Madariaga|1979|p=374}}</ref> However, no action was taken on any recommendations put forth by the commission due to the calling of the Legislative Commission. In July 1765, Dumaresq wrote to Dr. John Brown about the commission's problems and received a long reply containing very general and sweeping suggestions for education and social reforms in Russia. Dr. Brown argued, in a democratic country, education ought to be under the state's control and based on an education code. He also placed great emphasis on the \"proper and effectual education of the female sex\"; two years prior, Catherine had commissioned Ivan Betskoy to draw up the General Programme for the Education of Young People of Both Sexes.<ref>Hans, \u201cDumaresq\u201d, 233.</ref> This work emphasised the fostering of the creation of a 'new kind of people' raised in isolation from the damaging influence of a backward Russian environment.<ref>{{harvnb|Dixon|2009|p=130}}</ref> The Establishment of the Moscow Foundling Home (Moscow Orphanage) was the first attempt at achieving that goal. It was charged with admitting destitute and extramarital children  to educate them in any way the state deemed fit. Since the Moscow Foundling Home was not established as a state-funded institution, it represented an opportunity to experiment with new educational theories. However, the Moscow Foundling Home was unsuccessful, mainly due to extremely high mortality rates, which prevented many of the children from living long enough to develop into the enlightened subjects the state desired.<ref>Catherine Evtuhov, ''A History of Russia: Peoples, Legends, Events, Forces'' (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2004).</ref>\n\n[[File:Moscow Orphanage asv2018-01.jpg|thumb|The [[Moscow Orphanage]]]]\n[[File:Galaktionov Smolny institute 1823.jpg|thumb|The [[Smolny Institute]], the first Russian [[Institute for Noble Maidens]] and the first European state higher education institution for women]]\nNot long after the Moscow Foundling Home, at the instigation of her factotum, [[Ivan Betskoy]], she wrote a manual for the education of young children, drawing from the ideas of [[John Locke]], and founded the famous [[Smolny Institute]] in 1764, first of its kind in Russia. At first, the Institute only admitted young girls of the noble elite, but eventually it began to admit girls of the petit-[[bourgeoisie]], as well.<ref>{{harvnb|Max|2006|p=20}}</ref> The girls who attended the Smolny Institute, Smolyanki, were often accused of being ignorant of anything that went on in the world outside the walls of the Smolny buildings. Within the walls of the Institute, they were taught impeccable French, musicianship, dancing, and complete awe of the Monarch. At the Institute, enforcement of strict discipline was central to its philosophy. Running and games were forbidden, and the building was kept particularly cold because too much warmth was  believed to be harmful to the developing body, as was excess play.<ref>{{harvnb|Max|2006|p=21}}</ref>\n\nDuring 1768\u20131774, no progress was made in setting up a national school system.<ref>{{harvnb|Madariaga|1979|p=379}}</ref> Catherine continued to investigate educational theory and practice of other countries. She made many educational reforms despite the lack of a national school system. The remodelling of the Cadet Corps 1766 initiated many educational reforms. It then began to take children from a very young age and educate them until the age of 21. The curriculum was broadened from the professional military curriculum to include the sciences, philosophy, ethics, history, and international law. This policy in the Cadet Corps influenced the teaching in the Naval Cadet Corps and in the Engineering and Artillery Schools. After the war and the defeat of Pugachev, Catherine laid the obligation to establish schools at the ''guberniya''\u2014a provincial subdivision of the Russian empire ruled by a governor\u2014on the Boards of Social Welfare set up with the participation of elected representatives from the three free estates.<ref>{{harvnb|Madariaga|1979|p=380}}</ref>\n\nBy 1782, Catherine arranged another advisory commission to study the information gathered about the educational systems of many different countries.<ref>{{harvnb|Madariaga|1979|p=383}}</ref> A system produced by a mathematician, [[Franz Aepinus]], stood out in particular. He was strongly in favor of the adoption of the Austrian three-tier model of trivial, real, and normal schools at the village, town, and provincial capital levels. In addition to the advisory commission, Catherine established a Commission of National Schools under [[Pyotr Zavadovsky]]. This commission was charged with organizing a national school network, training the teachers, and providing the textbooks. On 5 August 1786, the Russian Statute of National Education was promulgated.<ref name=\"Madariaga, Foundation, 385\">{{harvnb|Madariaga|1979|p=385}}</ref> The statute established a two-tier network of high schools and primary schools in ''guberniya'' capitals that were free of charge, open to all of the free classes (not serfs), and co-educational. It also regulated, in detail, the subjects to be taught at every age and the method of teaching. In addition to the textbooks translated by the commission, teachers were provided with the \"Guide to Teachers\". This work, divided into four parts, dealt with teaching methods, the subjects taught, the behaviour of the teacher, and the running of a school.<ref name=\"Madariaga, Foundation, 385\" />\n\nJudgment of the 19th century was generally critical, claiming that Catherine failed to supply enough money to support her educational programme.<ref>{{harvnb|Madariaga|1979|p=391}}</ref> Two years after the implementation of Catherine's programme, a member of the National Commission inspected the institutions established. Throughout Russia, the inspectors encountered a patchy response. While the nobility put up appreciable amounts of money for these institutions, they preferred to send their own children to private, more prestigious institutions. Also, the townspeople tended to turn against the junior schools and their pedagogical{{Clarify|date=August 2019}} methods. An estimated 62,000 pupils were being educated in some 549 state institutions near the end of Catherine's reign. This was only a minuscule number of people compared to the size of the Russian population.<ref>{{harvnb|Madariaga|1979|p=394}}</ref>\n\n=== Religious affairs ===\n[[File:Katharina II., die Gro\u00dfe.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Catherine II in the Russian national costume]]\n\nCatherine's apparent whole-hearted adoption of all things Russian (including [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodoxy]]) may have prompted her personal indifference to religion. She nationalised all of the church lands to help pay for her wars, largely emptied the monasteries, and forced most of the remaining clergymen to survive as farmers or from fees for baptisms and other services.  Very few members of the nobility entered the Church, which became even less important than before. She did not allow dissenters to build chapels, and she suppressed religious dissent after the onset of the French Revolution.<ref name=\"madariaga111\">{{harvnb|Madariaga|1981|pp=111\u201322}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Catherine promoted Christianity in her anti-Ottoman policy, promoting the protection and fostering of Christians under Turkish rule. She placed strictures on Roman Catholics (''[[Ukase|ukaz]]'' of 23 February 1769), mainly Polish, and attempted to assert and extend state control over them in the wake of the partitions of Poland.<ref name=newadvent>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13253a.htm|title=The Religion of Russia|accessdate=24 March 2007}}</ref> Nevertheless, Catherine's Russia provided an asylum and a base for regrouping to the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] following the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|suppression of the Jesuits]] in most of Europe in 1773.<ref name=newadvent />\n\n==== Islam ====\n{{Seealso|Islam in Russia}}\n[[File:\u0411\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043a\u0438 \u0432 \u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0435.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Bashkirs|Bashkir]] riders from the Ural steppes]]\nCatherine took many different approaches to Islam during her reign. Between 1762 and 1773, Muslims were actively prohibited from owning any Orthodox serfs. They were also pressured into Orthodoxy through monetary incentives.<ref>{{harvnb|Fisher|1968|p=544}}</ref> Catherine promised more serfs of all religions, as well as amnesty for convicts, if Muslims chose to convert to Orthodoxy.<ref name=\"Fisher, Alan W. 1968\">{{harvnb|Fisher|1968|p=545}}</ref> However, the Legislative Commission of 1767 offered several seats to people professing the Islamic faith. This commission promised to protect their religious rights, but did not do so. Many Orthodox peasants felt threatened by the sudden change, and burned mosques as a sign of their displeasure.<ref name=\"Fisher, Alan W. 1968\" /> Catherine chose to assimilate Islam into the state rather than eliminate it when public outcry became too disruptive. After the \"Toleration of All Faiths\" Edict of 1773, Muslims were permitted to build mosques and practise all of their traditions, the most obvious of these being the pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], which had been denied previously.<ref>{{harvnb|Fisher|1968|p=546}}</ref> Catherine created the [[Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly]] to help regulate Muslim-populated regions, as well as regulate the instruction and ideals of mullahs. The positions on the Assembly were appointed and paid for by Catherine and her government, as a way of regulating the religious affairs of her nation.<ref>{{harvnb|Fisher|1968|p=548}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Russian Empire 1792 Map.jpg|thumb|280px|Russian Empire in 1792]]\nIn 1785, Catherine approved the subsidising of new mosques and new town settlements for Muslims. This was another attempt to organise and passively control the outer fringes of her country. By building new settlements with mosques placed in them, Catherine attempted to ground many of the [[nomad]]ic people who wandered through southern Russia.<ref>{{harvnb|Fisher|1968|p=549}}</ref> In 1786, she assimilated the Islamic schools into the Russian public school system, to be regulated by the government. The plan was another attempt to force nomadic people to settle. This allowed the Russian government to control more people, especially those who previously had not fallen under the jurisdiction of Russian law.<ref>{{harvnb|Madariaga|1981|pp=508\u201311}}</ref>\n\n==== Judaism ====\n{{Seealso|Judaism in Russia}}\nRussia often treated Judaism as a separate entity, where Jews were maintained with a separate legal and bureaucratic system.  Although the government knew that Judaism existed, Catherine and her advisers had no real definition of what a \"Jew\" is, since the term meant many things during her reign.<ref>{{harvnb|Klier|1976|p=505}}</ref> Judaism was a small, if not nonexistent, religion in Russia until 1772. When Catherine agreed to the [[First Partition of Poland]], the large new Jewish element was treated as a separate people, defined by their religion. In keeping with their treatment in Poland, Catherine allowed the Jews to separate themselves from Orthodox society, with certain restrictions. She levied additional taxes on the followers of Judaism; if a family converted to the Orthodox faith, that additional tax was lifted.<ref>{{harvnb|Klier|1976|pp=506\u201307}}</ref> Jewish members of society were required to pay double the tax of their Orthodox neighbours. Converted Jews could gain permission to enter the merchant class and farm as free peasants under Russian rule.<ref>{{harvnb|Klier|1976|p=507}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Madariaga|1981|pp=504\u201308}}</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to assimilate the Jews into Russia's economy, Catherine included them under the rights and laws of the Charter of the Towns of 1782.<ref>{{harvnb|Klier|1976|p=511}}</ref> Orthodox Russians disliked the inclusion of Judaism, mainly for economic reasons. Catherine tried to keep the Jews away from certain economic spheres, even under the guise of equality; in 1790, she banned Jewish citizens from Moscow's middle class.<ref>{{harvnb|Klier|1976|p=512}}</ref>\n\nIn 1785, Catherine declared Jews to be officially foreigners, with foreigners' rights.<ref>{{harvnb|Klier|1976|p=515}}</ref> This re-established the separate identity that Judaism maintained in Russia throughout the Jewish [[Haskalah]]. Catherine's decree also denied Jews the rights of an Orthodox or naturalised citizen of Russia. Taxes doubled again for those of Jewish descent in 1794, and Catherine officially declared that Jews bore no relation to Russians.\n\n==== Russian Orthodoxy ====\n[[File:Kingsobor.jpg|thumb|left|upright|St. Catherine Cathedral in [[Kingisepp]], an example of Late Baroque architecture]]\n\nIn many ways, the Orthodox Church fared no better than its foreign counterparts during the reign of Catherine. Under her leadership, she completed what Peter III had started: the church's lands were expropriated, and the budget of both monasteries and bishoprics were controlled by the [[College of Economy]].<ref>Raeff, Mark. ''Catherine the Great: A Profile'' (New York: Hill and Wang, 1972), 293.</ref> Endowments from the government replaced income from privately held lands. The endowments were often much less than the original intended amount.<ref name=\"Hosking 231\">{{harvnb|Hosking|1997|p=231}}</ref> She closed 569 of 954 monasteries, of which only 161 received government money. Only 400,000 rubles of church wealth were paid back.<ref>Richard Pipes, ''Russia under the old regime'', p. 242</ref> While other religions (such as Islam) received invitations to the Legislative Commission, the Orthodox clergy did not receive a single seat.<ref name=\"Hosking 231\" /> Their place in government was restricted severely during the years of Catherine's reign.<ref name=\"madariaga111\" />\n\nIn 1762, to help mend the rift between the Orthodox church and a sect that called themselves the [[Old Believers]], Catherine passed an act that allowed Old Believers to practise their faith openly without interference.<ref name=\"Raeff, Marc 1972\">[[Marc Raeff]],  ''Catherine the Great: A Profile'' (New York: Hill and Wang, 1972), 294.</ref> While claiming religious tolerance, she intended to recall the Believers into the official church. They refused to comply, and in 1764, she deported over 20,000 Old Believers to Siberia on the grounds of their faith.<ref name=\"Raeff, Marc 1972\" /> In later years, Catherine amended her thoughts. Old Believers were allowed to hold elected municipal positions after the Urban Charter of 1785, and she promised religious freedom to those who wished to settle in Russia.<ref>{{harvnb|Hosking|1997|p=237}}</ref><ref>Raef, ''Catherine the Great: A Profile'' p. 296.</ref>\n\nReligious education was also strictly reviewed. At first, she simply attempted to revise clerical studies, proposing a reform of religious schools. This reform never progressed beyond the planning stages. By 1786, Catherine excluded all religion and clerical studies programmes from lay education.<ref>Raeff, Marc. ''Catherine the Great: A Profile'' (New York: Hill and Wang, 1972), 298.</ref> By separating the public interests from those of the church, Catherine began a secularisation of the day-to-day workings of Russia. She transformed the clergy from a group that wielded great power over the Russian government and its people to a segregated community forced to depend on the state for compensation.<ref name=\"Hosking 231\" />\n\n=== Personal life ===\n[[File:Orlov greg.jpeg|thumb|upright|Count [[Grigory Orlov]], by [[Fyodor Rokotov]]]]\n\nCatherine, throughout her long reign, took many lovers, often elevating them to high positions<ref>{{Cite journal |first=John |last=Alexander |title=Catherine the Great, life and legend |page=224 |ref=harv}}</ref> for as long as they held her interest, and then pensioning them off with gifts of serfs and large estates. The percentage of state money spent on the court increased from 10.4% in 1767 to 11.4% in 1781 to 13.5% in 1795. Catherine gave away 66,000 serfs from 1762\u201372, 202,000 from 1773\u201393, and 100,000 in one day: 18 August 1795.<ref name=\"Pipes\">{{Cite journal|first=Richard|last=Pipes|title=Russia under the old regime|ref=harv}}</ref>{{rp |119}} Catherine bought the support of the [[bureaucracy]]. From 19 April 1764, any bureaucrat holding the same rank for seven years or more was instantly promoted. On 13 September 1767, Catherine decreed that after seven years in one rank, civil servants would be automatically promoted regardless of office or merit.<ref>Richard Pipes, Russia under the old regime, page 135</ref>\n\nAfter her affair with her lover and adviser [[Grigory Potyomkin|Grigori Alexandrovich Potemkin]] ended in 1776, he allegedly selected a candidate-lover for her who had the physical beauty and mental faculties to hold her interest (such as [[Alexander Dmitriev-Mamonov]] and Nicholas Alexander Suk<ref>Bushkovitch, Paul. ''A Concise History of Russia''. New York, Oxford University Press, 2011</ref>). Some of these men loved her in return, and she always showed generosity towards them, even after the affair ended. One of her lovers, [[Pyotr Zavadovsky]], received 50,000 rubles, a pension of 5,000 rubles, and 4,000 peasants in Ukraine after she dismissed him in 1777.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Farquhar|first=Michael|year=2001|title=A Treasure of Royal Scandals|page=[https://archive.org/details/treasuryofroyals00farq/page/7 7]|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|place=New York|isbn=978-0-7394-2025-6|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/treasuryofroyals00farq/page/7}}</ref> The last of her lovers, [[Platon Zubov|Prince Zubov]], was 40 years her junior.

New  York: Oxford University Press, 1989, pp. 332\u201335</ref>\n\nCatherine kept her illegitimate son by Grigori Orlov ([[Bobrinsky|Alexis Bobrinsky]], later elevated to Count Bobrinsky by Paul I) near [[Tula, Russia|Tula]], away from her court.\n\n==== Poniatowski ====\n[[File:Stanislaw poniatowski bacciarelli.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]], the last King of [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]]]]\n\nSir [[Charles Hanbury Williams]], the British ambassador to Russia, offered Stanis\u0142aw Poniatowski a place in the embassy in return for gaining Catherine as an ally.  Poniatowski, through his mother's side, came from the [[Czartoryski family]], prominent members of the pro-Russian faction in Poland; Poniatowski and Catherine were eighth cousins, twice removed by their mutual ancestor King [[Christian I of Denmark]], by virtue of Poniatowski's maternal descent from the Scottish [[House of Stuart]]. Catherine, 26 years old and already married to the then-Grand Duke Peter for some 10 years, met the 22-year-old Poniatowski in 1755, therefore well before encountering the Orlov brothers. In 1757, Poniatowski served in the British forces during the [[Seven Years' War]], thus severing close relationships with Catherine. She bore him a daughter named Anna Petrovna in December 1757 (not to be confused with [[Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna of Russia]], the daughter of Peter I's second marriage).\n\nKing [[Augustus III of Poland]] died in 1763, so Poland needed to elect a new ruler. Catherine supported Poniatowski as a candidate to become the next king.  She sent the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian army]] into Poland to avoid possible disputes. Russia invaded Poland on 26 August 1764, threatening to fight, and imposing Poniatowski as king. Poniatowski accepted the throne, and thereby put himself under Catherine's control. News of Catherine's plan spread and Frederick II (others say the Ottoman [[sultan]]) warned her that if she tried to conquer Poland by marrying Poniatowski, all of Europe would oppose her. She had no intention of marrying him, having already given birth to Orlov's child and to the Grand Duke Paul by then.\n\nPrussia (through the agency of [[Prince Henry of Prussia (1726\u20131802)|Prince Henry]]), Russia (under Catherine), and Austria (under [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]]) began preparing the ground for the partitions of Poland. In the first partition, 1772, the three powers split {{convert|20000|sqmi|km2|order=flip|abbr=on}} between them. Russia got territories east of the line connecting, more or less, [[Riga]]\u2013[[Polotsk]]\u2013[[Mogilev]]. In the second partition, in 1793, Russia received the most land, from west of [[Minsk]] almost to [[Kiev]] and down the river [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]], leaving some spaces of [[steppe]] down south in front of [[Ochakiv|Ochakov]], on the [[Black Sea]]. Later uprisings in Poland led to the third partition in 1795, one year before Catherine's death. Poland ceased to exist as an independent nation [[Polish Independence Day|until 1918]], in the aftermath of World War I.\n\n==== Orlov ====\n[[File:Alexei borinsky.jpeg|thumb|upright|Catherine the Great's natural son by Count Orlov, [[Bobrinsky|Aleksey Grigorievich Bobrinsky]] (1762\u20131813 in his estate of Bogoroditsk, near Tula), born three months before the deposition and assassination by the Orlov brothers of her husband Peter III]]\n\n[[Grigory Orlov]], the grandson of a rebel in the [[Streltsy Uprising]] (1698) against Peter the Great, distinguished himself in the [[Battle of Zorndorf]] (25 August 1758), receiving three wounds. He represented an opposite to Peter's pro-Prussian sentiment, with which Catherine disagreed. By 1759, Catherine and he had become lovers; no one told Catherine's husband, the Grand Duke Peter. Catherine saw Orlov as very useful, and he became instrumental in 28 June 1762 ''coup d\u2019\u00e9tat'' against her husband, but she preferred to remain the Dowager Empress of Russia, rather than marrying anyone.\n\nGrigory Orlov and his other three brothers found themselves rewarded with titles, money, swords, and other gifts, but Catherine did not marry Grigory, who proved inept at politics and useless when asked for advice. He received a palace in Saint Petersburg when Catherine became Empress.\n\nOrlov died in 1783. Their son, Aleksey Grygoriovich Bobrinsky (1762\u20131813), had one daughter, [[Maria Alexeyeva Bobrinsky]] (Bobrinskaya) (1798\u20131835), who married in 1819 the 34-year-old Prince [[Nikolai Gagarin|Nikolai Sergeevich Gagarin]] (London, England, 1784\u20131842) who took part in the [[Battle of Borodino]] (7 September 1812) against [[Napoleon]], and later served as ambassador in [[Turin]], the capital of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]].\n\n==== Potemkin ====\n[[File:1000 Potiomkin.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Catherine II and Potemkin on the [[Millennium of Russia|Millennium Monument]] in [[Novgorod]]]]\n[[Grigory Potemkin]] was involved in the ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' of 1762. In 1772, Catherine's close friends informed her of Orlov's affairs with other women, and she dismissed him. By the winter of 1773, the [[Pugachev's Rebellion|Pugachev revolt]] had started to threaten. Catherine's son Paul had also started gaining support; both of these trends threatened her power. She called Potemkin for help\u2014mostly military\u2014and he became devoted to her.\n\nIn 1772, Catherine wrote to Potemkin. Days earlier, she had found out about an uprising in the Volga region. She appointed General [[Aleksandr Bibikov]] to put down the uprising, but she needed Potemkin's advice on [[military strategy]]. Potemkin quickly gained positions and awards. Russian poets wrote about his virtues, the court praised him, foreign ambassadors fought for his favour, and his family moved into the palace. He later became the de facto absolute ruler of [[Novorossiya|New Russia]], governing its colonisation.\n\nIn 1780, the son of Holy Roman Empress Maria Theresa, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]], toyed with the idea of determining whether or not to enter an alliance with Russia, and asked to meet Catherine. Potemkin had the task of briefing him and travelling with him to Saint Petersburg. Potemkin also convinced Catherine to expand the universities in Russia to increase the number of scientists.\n\nPotemkin fell very ill in August 1783. Catherine worried  he would not finish his work developing the south as he had planned. Potemkin died at the age of 52 in 1791.\n\n=== Serfs ===\n{{Seealso|Serfdom in Russia}}\nAccording to a census taken from 1754 to 1762, Catherine owned 500,000 serfs.  A further 2.8 million belonged to the Russian state.<ref>Massie, Robert K. (2011). ''Catherine the Great: Portrait of a Woman''. New York: Random House. p. 302</ref>\n\n==== Rights and conditions ====\n[[File:Supplice du Grand Knout.jpg|thumb|upright|Punishment with a [[knout]]]]At the time of Catherine's reign, the landowning noble class owned the serfs, who were bound to the land  they tilled. Children of serfs were born into [[serfdom]] and worked the same land their parents had. The serfs had very limited rights, but they were not exactly slaves. While the state did not technically allow them to own possessions, some serfs were able to accumulate enough wealth to pay for their freedom.<ref>Elise Kimerling Wirtschafter, \u201cLegal Identity and the Possession of Serfs in Imperial Russia,\u201d ''The Journal of Modern History'', Vol. 70, No. 3 (September 1998), 564</ref> The understanding of law in [[imperial Russia]] by all sections of society was often weak, confused, or nonexistent, particularly in the provinces where most serfs lived. This is why some serfs were able to do things such as accumulate wealth. To become serfs, people would give up their freedoms to a landowner in exchange for their protection and support in times of hardship. In addition, they would receive land to till, but would be taxed a certain percentage of their crops to give to their landowners. These were the privileges a serf was entitled to and that nobles were bound to carry out. All of this was true before Catherine's reign, and this is the system she inherited.\n\nCatherine did initiate some changes to serfdom. If a noble did not live up to his side of the deal, the serfs could file complaints against him by following the proper channels of law.<ref>Isabel de Madriaga, \u201cCatherine II and the Serfs: A Reconsideration of Some Problems\u201d, ''The Slavonic and East European Review'', Vol. 52, No. 126 (Jan. 1974), 48\u201351</ref> Catherine gave them this new right, but in exchange they could no longer appeal directly to her. She did this because she did not want to be bothered by the peasantry, but did not want to give them reason to revolt. In this act she gave the serfs a legitimate bureaucratic status they had lacked before.<ref>Witschafter, \u201cLegal Identity\u201d, 563\u201364</ref> Some serfs were able to use their new status to their advantage. For example, serfs could apply to be freed if they were under illegal ownership, and non-nobles were not allowed to own serfs.<ref>Witschafter, \u201cLegal Identity\u201d, 565\u201367</ref> Some serfs did apply for freedom and were successful. In addition, some governors listened to the complaints of serfs and punished nobles, but this was by no means universal.\n\nOther than these, the rights of a serf were very limited. A landowner could punish his serfs at his discretion, and under Catherine the Great gained the ability to sentence his serfs to hard labour in Siberia, a punishment normally reserved for convicted criminals.<ref>Madriaga, \u201cCatherine II\u201d, 42\u201346</ref> The only thing a noble could not do to his serfs was to kill them. The life of a serf belonged to the state. Historically, when the serfs faced problems they could not solve on their own (such as abusive masters), they often appealed to the autocrat, and continued doing so during Catherine's reign, though she signed legislation prohibiting it.<ref>Madriaga, \u201cCatherine II\u201d, 48\u201351</ref> Although she did not want to communicate directly with the serfs, she did create some measures to improve their conditions as a class and reduce the size of the institution of serfdom. For example, she took action to limit the number of new serfs; she eliminated many ways for people to become serfs, culminating in the manifesto of 17 March 1775, which prohibited a serf who had once been freed from becoming a serf again.<ref>Madriaga, \u201cCatherine II\u201d, 35</ref> However, she also restricted the freedoms of many peasants. During her reign, Catherine gave away many state-owned peasants to become private serfs (owned by a landowner), and while their ownership changed hands, a serf's location never did. However, peasants owned by the state generally had more freedoms than those owned by a noble.\n\nWhile the majority of serfs were farmers bound to the land, a noble could also have his serfs sent away to learn a trade or be educated at a school, in addition to employing them at businesses that paid wages.<ref>Witschafter, \u201cLegal Identity\u201d, 567</ref> This happened more often during Catherine's reign because of the new schools she established. Only in this way could a serf leave the farm for which he was responsible.\n\n==== Attitudes towards Catherine ====\n[[File:\u041f\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0421\u0443\u0434 \u041f\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0432\u0430 (\u0413\u0418\u041c).jpg|thumb|Pugachev's rebellion]]\n\nThe attitude of the serfs towards their [[Autocracy|autocrat]] had historically been a positive one.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Field|first1=Daniel|title=Rebels in the Name of the Tsar|date=1976|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-395-21986-7|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Rebels_in_the_name_of_the_tsar.html?id=yNhoAAAAMAAJ}}</ref>\nHowever, if the tsar's policies were too extreme or too disliked, he was not considered the true tsar. In these cases, it was necessary to replace this \u201cfake\u201d tsar with the \u201ctrue\u201d tsar, whoever he may be. Because the serfs had no political power, they rioted to get their message across. But usually, if the serfs did not like the policies of the tsar, they saw the nobles as corrupt and evil, preventing the people of Russia from communicating with the well-intentioned tsar and misinterpreting his decrees.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mamonova|first1=Natalia|title=Naive Monarchism and Rural Resistance In Contemporary Russia|journal=Rural Sociology|volume=81|issue=3|date=2016|pages=316\u201342|doi=10.1111/ruso.12097|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/297408651|accessdate=12 September 2017}}</ref> However, they were already suspicious of Catherine upon her accession, because she had annulled an act by Peter III that had essentially freed the serfs belonging to the Orthodox Church.<ref>Marc Raeff, \u201cPugachev\u2019s Rebellion,\u201d in ''Preconditions of Revolution in Early Europe'', The Johns Hopkins Press, 1972, 170</ref> Naturally, the serfs did not like it when Catherine tried to take away their right to petition her because they felt as though she had severed their connection to the autocrat, and their power to appeal to her. Far away from the capital, they were also confused as to the circumstances of her accession to the throne.<ref>{{harvnb|Madariaga|1981|pp=239\u201355}}</ref>\n\nThe peasants were discontented because of many other factors, as well, including crop failure, and epidemics, especially a major [[Plague Riot|epidemic in 1771]]. The nobles were also imposing a stricter rule than ever, reducing the land of each serf and restricting their freedoms further beginning around 1767.<ref>Raeff, \u201cPugachev\u2019s Rebellion\u201d, 166\u201369</ref> Their discontent led to widespread outbreaks of violence and rioting during [[Pugachev's Rebellion]] of 1774. The serfs probably followed someone who was pretending to be the true tsar because of their feelings of disconnection to Catherine and her policies empowering the nobles, but this was not the first time they followed a pretender under Catherine's reign.<ref>Raeff, \u201cPugachev\u2019s Rebellion\u201d, 171</ref> Pugachev had made stories about himself acting as a real tsar should, helping the common people, listening to their problems, praying for them, and generally acting saintly, and this helped rally the peasants and serfs, with their very conservative values, to his cause.<ref>Raeff, \u201cPugachev\u2019s Rebellion\u201d, 171\u201372</ref> With all this discontent in mind, Catherine did rule for 10 years before the anger of the serfs boiled over into a rebellion as extensive as Pugachev's. The rebellion ultimately failed and in fact backfired as Catherine was pushed even further away from the idea of serf liberation following the violent uprising. Under Catherine's rule, despite her enlightened ideals, the serfs were generally unhappy and discontented.\n\n== Final months and death ==\n[[File:Catherine II walking by V.Borovikovskiy (1794, Tretyakov gallery).jpg|thumb|upright|1794 portrait of Catherine, age approximately 65, with the [[Chesme Column]] in the background]]\n\nThough Catherine's life and reign included remarkable personal successes, they ended in two failures. Her Swedish cousin (once removed), King [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden|Gustav IV Adolph]], visited her in September 1796, the Empress's intention being that her granddaughter Alexandra should become Queen of Sweden by marriage. A ball was given at the imperial court on 11 September, when the engagement was supposed to be announced.

Pretenders plagued Catherine the Great's reign in a way unmatched by any other period in Russian history. At least seventeen of the twenty-six pretenders during Catherine's reign appeared in one of three clusters; six from 1764\u20131765, six from 1772\u20131774, and five from 1782\u20131786. Pretenders did not plague Catherine's reign because of her sex or nationality since pretenders never threatened other female rulers or rulers of foreign descent in the way that Catherine II was. The rise of pretenders was not related to war or famine as neither appeared consistently with the pretenders. If there tended to be any form of famine during a pretender's rise it was during their claim to power and not inspired by it. Catherine's illegitimate rise to power through the assassination of her husband, Peter III, did not inspire the pretenders since Elizabeth, who came to power in a similar fashion to Catherine, never had the same problem. Evidence suggests that pretenders plagued Catherine's reign for economic reasons. An important correlation between the three clusters is that the economic standing of serfs was declining. The condition of serfs worsened at the start of Catherine's reign because there was a sharp increase, 47%, in the number of peasants on state land and an establishment of a poll tax. The decline of pretenders illustrates the correlation between the conditions of serfs and the appearance of pretenders in the last third of Catherine's reign because she improved legal and economic conditions for the serfs to deter future pretenders. The serfs were not the only social group that suffered from worsening economic conditions. Leading into Catherine's reign both the odnodvortsy and Cossacks faced a harsh decline in their economic standing. The odnodvortsy were particularly upset about the decline in their economic standing because they were descendants of wealthy landowning servicemen. The odnodvortsy were angered even more in some regions of Russia as land lords expanded their property claiming odnodvortsy and peasants as serfs. The declining standing of the odnodvortsy and Cossacks created motivation to become pretenders especially during the 1760s. Even more importantly the odnodvortsy and Cossacks were vital support for pretenders because of their military experience.<ref>Philip Longworth, \u201cThe Pretender Phenomenon in Eighteenth-Century Russia,\u201d  ''Past & Present'' 66 (1975): 66\u201371.</ref>\n\nAt least sixteen pretenders during Catherine's reign claimed that they were the deposed tsar, Peter III. A less common position pretenders claimed during Catherine's reign was that of Ivan VI. Ivan VI was a potential threat to Catherine since he was exiled as an infant and could lay claim to the throne. Peter III was the more popular option for pretenders since there existed legends that he was not actually dead, allowing pretenders to convince discontented Russians they were Peter III. Peter III was also popular among Russians because of his benevolent rule. Pretenders claiming to be Peter III used his popularity among Russians to gain support. Pretenders had to be careful to establish themselves as the ruler they claimed to be without being recognised as a normal mortal and not of royal blood. One popular way to prevent recognition was to claim their right to royalty far from their home as both Emal'Ian Ivanovich Pugachev and the pretender Artem'ev did. Pretenders also had to account for where they had disappeared to for the time since their reported deaths. For example, Pugachev claimed that he spent the eleven years since Peter III's reported death wandering abroad as far as [[Egypt]] or [[Constantinople]].<ref>Philip Longworth, \u201cThe Pretender Phenomenon in Eighteenth-Century Russia,\u201d ''Past & Present'' 66 (1975): 70\u201377.</ref>\n\n==== Pretenders and royal marks ====\n[[File:Imperial Monogram of Empress Catherine II of Russia.svg|thumb|upright|Imperial monogram]]\n\nMany Russians believed that tsars and tsarevichs bore special marks on their bodies symbolising their royal status, which became known as royal marks. Four of the pretenders claiming to be Peter III showed royal marks to legitimise their claims. The first fake Peter to have royal marks was Gavrila Kremnev who Lev Evdokimov recognised because of a cross on Kremnev's foot. Lev Evdokimov claimed that he had worked as a chorister at the royal palace and had held the real Peter III in his arms as a child therefore giving credibility to Kremnev's claims. Despite Kremnev's marking, he never gained many supporters and was flogged and branded with the words, \u201cdeserter and pretender\u201d. The next fake Peter III to show a royal mark of some sort was Fedot Kazin-Bogomolov in 1772. He showed a prison guard a cross on his chest and claimed he had two more on his arm and head, allowing him to gain many supporters. The government branded Kazin-Bogomolov despite his markings. The third Peter III with royal marks was the most famous of the four and the most successful pretender of the time, Pugachev. In 1773 Pugachev staged a revealing of his royal identity to a Cossack, Eremina Kuritsa, leading other Cossacks to challenge Pugachev at dinner, which resulted in him showing scars on his chest and head to the Cossacks. Pugachev claimed the scars on his chest were caused from the coup against him and that the scars on his forehead were from smallpox. Pugachev's rational reasoning for his markings caused him to continually gain supporters throughout his stand as a pretender. Unlike the first two pretenders to show royal marks, Pugachev's efforts cost him his life since his punishment was execution. The final pretender during Catherine's reign to reveal royal marks was Makar Mosiakin in 1774. Mosiakin entered a peasant hut claiming to be Peter III and then showed the peasants crosses on his arms, claiming they represented royal inheritance. According to the official report of the Mosiakin he had made the cross marks himself to convince people that he was Peter III, and he actually had some success as he managed to gain followers from various villages, going from house to house.<ref>Maureen Perrie, \u201cRoyal Marks\u201d, ''Kritika: Explorations in Russian and Eurasian History'' 11 (2010): 535, 546\u201349.</ref>\n\n=== Succession to the throne ===\n[[File:\u041c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u043d\u044f\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0438 \u0415\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0442\u044b \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0435\u0432\u043d\u044b.jpg|thumb|Catherine, [[Elizabeth Alexeievna (Louise of Baden)|Louise of Baden]], Catherine's son Paul and grandson [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander]], 1795]]\nOn a date already set for a week before she died, Catherine had intended to formally announce<ref name=\"Grande p. 427\" /> that Paul would be excluded from the succession, and that the crown would go to her eldest grandson, Alexander (whom she greatly favoured, and who subsequently became the emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] in 1801).

She came to power following a {{lang|fr|[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]}} that she organised\u2014resulting in her husband, [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]], being overthrown. Under her reign, Russia was revitalised; it grew larger and stronger, and was recognised as one of the [[great power]]s of Europe and Asia.\n\nIn her accession to power and her rule of the empire, Catherine often relied on her noble [[favourite]]s, most notably count [[Grigory Orlov]] and [[Grigory Potemkin]]. Assisted by highly successful [[field Marshals of Russia|generals]] such as [[Alexander Suvorov]] and [[Pyotr Rumyantsev]], and [[list of Russian Admirals|admirals]] such as [[Fyodor Ushakov]], she governed at a time when the Russian Empire was expanding rapidly by conquest and diplomacy. In the south, the [[Crimean Khanate]] was crushed following victories over the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the [[Russo-Turkish wars]], and Russia colonised the territories of [[Novorossiya]] along the coasts of the [[Black Sea|Black]] and [[Azov Sea]]s. In the west, the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], ruled by Catherine's former lover, King [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]], was eventually [[Partitions of Poland|partitioned]], with the Russian Empire gaining the largest share. In the east, Russia [[Russian colonisation of the Americas|started to colonise]] Alaska, establishing [[Russian America]].\n\nCatherine reformed the administration of Russian [[guberniya]]s, and many [[list of cities in Russia|new cities and towns]] were founded on her orders. An admirer of [[Peter the Great]], Catherine continued to modernize Russia along Western European lines. However, military conscription and the economy continued to depend on [[serfdom in Russia|serfdom]], and the increasing demands of the state and of private landowners intensified the exploitation of serf labor. This was one of the chief reasons behind several rebellions, including the large-scale [[Pugachev's Rebellion|Pugachev Rebellion]] of [[Cossacks]] and peasants.\n\nCatherine decided to have herself [[inoculation|inoculated]] against [[smallpox]] by a British doctor, [[Thomas Dimsdale]].

Lestocq and Frederick wanted to strengthen the friendship between Prussia and Russia to weaken [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]]'s influence and ruin the Russian chancellor [[Alexey Bestuzhev-Ryumin|Bestuzhev]], on whom Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]] relied, and who acted as a known partisan of Russo-Austrian co-operation.\n\nCatherine first met Peter III at the age of 10. Based on her writings, she found Peter detestable upon meeting him. She disliked his pale complexion and his fondness for alcohol at such a young age. Peter also still played with toy soldiers. Catherine later wrote that she stayed at one end of the castle, and Peter at the other.<ref>{{cite book|author=Streeter, Michael |title=Catherine the Great|publisher=Haus Publishing|date= 2007| page= 6}}</ref>\n\nThe diplomatic intrigue failed, largely due to the intervention of Sophie's mother, [[Johanna Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp]]. Historical accounts portray Johanna as a cold, abusive woman who loved gossip and court intrigues. Her hunger for fame centred on her daughter's prospects of becoming empress of Russia, but she infuriated Empress Elizabeth, who eventually banned her from the country for spying for [[Frederick II of Prussia|King Frederick of Prussia]]. Empress Elizabeth knew the family well: she had intended to marry Princess Johanna's brother [[Christian August of Holstein-Gottorp, Prince of Eutin#Marriage and issue|Charles Augustus]] (Karl August von Holstein), who had died of [[smallpox]] in 1727 before the wedding could take place.<ref>{{cite book| last = Huberty| first = Michel| title = L'Allemagne dynastique: Les quinze Familles qui on fait l'Empire| year = 1994| isbn=978-2-901138-07-5| page = 166 }}</ref> Despite Johanna's interference, Empress Elizabeth took a strong liking to Catherine, who, on arrival in Russia in 1744 spared no effort to ingratiate herself not only with Empress Elizabeth, but with her husband and with the [[Russians|Russian people]] as well. Catherine applied herself to learning the [[Russian language]] with zeal, rising at night and walking about her bedroom barefoot, repeating her lessons. (Even though she mastered the language, she retained an accent.) This practice led to a severe attack of [[pneumonia]] in March 1744. When she wrote her [[memoir]]s, she said she made up her mind when she came to Russia to do whatever was necessary and to profess to believe whatever was required of her, to become qualified to wear the crown.\n\n[[File:Empress Catherine The Great circa 1845 (George Christoph Grooth).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait\nof the Grand Duchess Ekaterina Alekseyevna around the time of her wedding, by George Christoph Grooth, 1745]]\n\nCatherine recalled in her memoirs that as soon as she arrived in Russia, she fell ill with a [[pleuritis]] that almost killed her. She credited her survival to frequent [[bloodletting]]; in a single day, she had four [[Phlebotomy|phlebotomies]]. Her mother, who was opposed to this practice, fell into the Empress' disfavour. When Catherine's situation looked desperate, her mother wanted her confessed by a Lutheran priest. Awaking from her [[delirium]], however, Catherine said: \"I don't want any Lutheran; I want my Orthodox father [clergyman].\" This raised her in the Empress' esteem.\n\nPrincess Sophie's father, a devout German [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], opposed his daughter's conversion to [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]]. Despite his objection, however, on 28 June 1744, the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] received Princess Sophie as a member with the new name Catherine (Yekaterina or Ekaterina) and the (artificial) [[patronymic]] \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430 (Alekseyevna, daughter of Aleksey). On the following day, the formal betrothal took place. The long-planned dynastic marriage finally occurred on 21 August 1745 in [[Saint Petersburg]]. Sophie had turned 16; her father did not travel to Russia for the wedding. The bridegroom, known then as Peter von Holstein-Gottorp, had become Duke of [[Dukes of Holstein-Gottorp|Holstein-Gottorp]] (located in the north-west of {{As of|2008 |alt=present-day}} Germany near the border with Denmark) in 1739. The newlyweds settled in the palace of [[Oranienbaum, Russia|Oranienbaum]], which remained the residence of the \"young court\" for many years to come. \n\nBored with her husband, Catherine became an avid reader of books, mostly in French.<ref>{{harvnb|Brechka|1969|pp=40}}</ref> Catherine disparaged her husband as devoted to reading \"Lutheran prayer-books, the other the history of and trial of some highway robbers who had been hung or broken on the wheel\".<ref>{{harvnb|Brechka|1969|pp=40}}</ref> It was during this period that she first read Voltaire and the other ''philosophes'' of the French Enlightenment.<ref>{{harvnb|Brechka|1969|pp=40}}</ref> As she learned Russian, she became increasingly interested in the literature of her adopted country.<ref>{{harvnb|Brechka|1969|pp=41}}</ref> Finally, she also read the Classics.

He would announce trying drills in the morning to male servants, who later joined Catherine in her room to sing and dance until late hours.\n\nCatherine became pregnant with her second child, Anna, who only lived to 14 months, in 1759. Due to various rumours of Catherine's promiscuity, Peter was led to believe  he was not the child's biological father and is known to have proclaimed, \"Go to the devil!\", when Catherine angrily dismissed his accusation. She thus spent much of this time alone in her private [[boudoir]] to hide away from Peter's abrasive personality.<ref>Sergeant, Philip W.

The tsar's eccentricities and policies, including a great admiration for the Prussian king, [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]], alienated the same groups that Catherine had cultivated. Russia and Prussia had fought each other during the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u20131763), and Russian troops had occupied Berlin in 1761. Peter supported Frederick II, however, eroding much of his support among the nobility. Peter ceased Russian operations against Prussia, and Frederick suggested the [[Partitions of Poland|partition of Polish territories]] with Russia. Peter also intervened in a dispute between his Duchy of [[Holstein]] and [[Denmark\u2013Norway|Denmark]] over the province of [[Duchy of Schleswig|Schleswig]] (see [[Count Johann Hartwig Ernst von Bernstorff]]).

Ivan VI was assassinated during an attempt to free him as part of a failed ''coup'': like Empress Elizabeth before her, Catherine had given strict instructions that Ivan was to be killed in the event of any such attempt. [[Yelizaveta Alekseyevna Tarakanova]] (1753\u20131775) was another potential rival.\n\nAlthough Catherine did not descend from the Romanov dynasty, her ancestors included members of the [[Rurik dynasty]], which preceded the Romanovs. She succeeded her husband as [[Queen regnant|empress regnant]], following the precedent established when [[Catherine I of Russia|Catherine I]] succeeded her husband [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] in 1725. Historians debate Catherine's technical status, whether as a regent or as a [[usurper]], tolerable only during the minority of her son, [[Paul I of Russia|Grand Duke Paul]].

Russia inflicted some of the heaviest defeats ever suffered by the Ottoman Empire, including the [[Battle of Chesma]] (5\u20137 July 1770) and the [[Battle of Kagul]] (21 July 1770). In 1769 a last major [[Crimean\u2013Nogai slave raids in Eastern Europe|Crimean\u2013Nogai slave raid]], which ravaged the [[New Serbia (historical province)|Russian held territories]] in Ukraine, saw the capture of up to 20,000 slaves.<ref>{{cite web |first=Mikhail|last=Kizilov|title= Slave Trade in the Early Modern Crimea From the Perspective of Christian, Muslim, and Jewish Sources |url= https://www.academia.edu/2971600/Slave_Trade_in_the_Early_Modern_Crimea_From_the_Perspective_of_Christian_Muslim_and_Jewish_Sources |work= Oxford University|pages= 2\u20137.}}</ref>\n\nThe Russian victories procured access to the Black Sea and allowed Catherine's government to incorporate present-day southern [[Ukraine]], where the Russians founded the new cities of [[Odessa]], [[Mykolaiv|Nikolayev]], Yekaterinoslav (literally: \"the Glory of Catherine\"; the future [[Dnipro]]), and [[Kherson]]. The [[Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca]], signed 10 July 1774, gave the Russians territories at [[Azov]], [[Kerch]], [[Yeni-Kale|Yenikale]], [[Kinburn Peninsula|Kinburn]], and the small strip of Black Sea coast between the rivers [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] and [[Southern Bug|Bug]]. The treaty also removed restrictions on Russian naval or commercial traffic in the [[Azov Sea]], granted to Russia the position of protector of [[Orthodox Christian]]s in the Ottoman Empire, and made the Crimea a protectorate of Russia.\n\nCatherine [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire|annexed the Crimea]] in 1783, nine years after the [[Crimean Khanate]] had gained nominal independence\u2014which had been guaranteed by Russia\u2014from the Ottoman Empire as a result of her first war against the Turks. The palace of the Crimean khans passed into the hands of the Russians. In 1787, Catherine conducted a triumphal procession in the Crimea, which helped provoke the next Russo-Turkish War.\n\n[[File:\u041f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u041e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c \u041e\u0434\u0435\u0441\u0441\u044b.jpg|thumb|''[[Monument to the founders of Odessa]]'': Catherine and her companions [[Jos\u00e9 de Ribas]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Sainte de Wollant]], Platon Zubov and Grigory Potemkin]]\n[[File:1800_Novoros_gov.jpg|thumb|Catherine extended the borders of the Russian Empire southward to absorb the [[Crimean Khanate]]]]\nThe Ottomans restarted hostilities in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787\u20131792)|Russo-Turkish War of 1787\u201392]].

Catherine waged a new war [[Persian Expedition of 1796|against Persia]] in 1796 after they, under the new king [[Agha Mohammad Khan]], had [[Battle of Krtsanisi|again invaded Georgia]] and established rule [[Battle of Krtsanisi|in 1795]] and had expelled the newly established Russian garrisons in the Caucasus. The ultimate goal for the Russian government, however, was to topple the anti-Russian shah (king), and to replace him with a half-brother, [[Morteza Qoli Khan]], who had defected to Russia and was therefore pro-Russian.<ref>Cronin, Stephanie.

The Russian troops set out from [[Kizlyar]] in April 1796 [[Storming of Derbent|and stormed]] the key fortress of [[Derbent]] on 10 May. The event was glorified by the court poet [[Gavrila Derzhavin|Derzhavin]] in his famous ode; he later commented bitterly on Zubov's inglorious return from the expedition in another remarkable poem.\n\nBy mid-June, [[Prince Zubov|Zubov's]] troops overran without any resistance most of the territory of modern-day [[Azerbaijan]], including three principal cities\u2014[[Baku]], [[Shemakha]], and [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]]. By November, they were stationed at the confluence of the [[Araks]] and [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura Rivers]], poised to attack mainland [[Iran]]. In that month, the Empress of Russia died and her successor [[Paul I of Russia|Paul]], who detested that the [[Prince Zubov|Zubovs]] had other plans for the army, ordered the troops to retreat to Russia. This reversal aroused the frustration and enmity of the powerful Zubovs and other officers who took part in the campaign: many of them would be among the conspirators who arranged Paul's murder five years later.\n\n==== Relations with Western Europe ====\n{{See also|Russia in the American Revolutionary War#Russian Diplomacy during the War}}\n[[File:Taming-of-the-Shrew-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|left|A 1791 British caricature of an attempted mediation between Catherine (on the right, supported by Austria and France) and Turkey]]\n\nCatherine longed for recognition as an enlightened sovereign. She pioneered for Russia the role that Britain later played through most of the 19th and early 20th centuries as an international mediator in disputes that could, or did, lead to war. She acted as mediator in the [[War of the Bavarian Succession]] (1778\u201379) between the German states of Prussia and Austria. In 1780, she established a [[First League of Armed Neutrality|League of Armed Neutrality]], designed to defend neutral shipping from the [[Royal Navy|British Royal Navy]] during the [[American Revolution]].\n\nFrom 1788 to 1790, Russia fought a [[Russo-Swedish War (1788\u20131790)|war against Sweden]], a conflict instigated by Catherine's cousin, King [[Gustav III of Sweden]], who expected to simply overtake the Russian armies still engaged in war against the Ottoman Turks, and hoped to strike Saint Petersburg directly. But Russia's [[Baltic Fleet]] checked the Royal Swedish navy in a tied [[battle of Hogland]] (July 1788), and the Swedish army failed to advance. Denmark declared war on Sweden in 1788 (the [[Theater War|Theatre War]]). After the decisive defeat of the Russian fleet at the [[Battle of Svensksund]] in 1790, the parties signed the [[Treaty of V\u00e4r\u00e4l\u00e4]] (14 August 1790), returning all conquered territories to their respective owners and confirming the [[Treaty of \u00c5bo]]. Peace ensued for 20 years, aided by the assassination of Gustav III in 1792.\n\n==== Partitions of Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth ====\n{{Main|Partitions of Poland}}\n[[File:Rzeczpospolita Rozbiory 3.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Partitions of Poland|The partitions of Poland]], carried out by Russia, the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] in 1772, 1793 and 1795]]\nIn 1764, Catherine placed [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]], her former lover, on the [[List of Polish monarchs|Polish throne]]. Although the idea of partitioning Poland came from the King [[Frederick II of Prussia]], Catherine took a leading role in carrying it out in the 1790s. In 1768, she formally became protector of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], which provoked an [[Anti-Russian sentiment|anti-Russian]] uprising in Poland, the [[Bar Confederation|Confederation of Bar]] (1768\u201372). After the uprising broke down due to internal politics in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, she established in the ''Rzeczpospolita'', a system of government fully controlled by the Russian Empire through a [[Permanent Council]], under the supervision of her [[Ambassadors and envoys from Russia to Poland (1763\u20131794)|ambassadors and envoys]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Catherine the Great : life and legend|last=Alexander, John T.|date=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-505236-6|location=New York|oclc=17807369|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/catherinegreatli0000alex}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, Catherine rejected many principles of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] she had once viewed favourably. Afraid the [[Constitution of 3 May 1791|May Constitution of Poland]] (1791) might lead to a resurgence in the power of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth and the growing democratic movements inside the Commonwealth might become a threat to the European monarchies, Catherine decided to intervene in Poland. She provided support to a Polish anti-reform group known as the [[Targowica Confederation]]. After defeating Polish loyalist forces in the [[Polish\u2013Russian War of 1792]] and in the [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising]] (1794), Russia completed the partitioning of Poland, dividing all of the remaining Commonwealth territory with Prussia and Austria (1795).\n\n==== Relations with Japan ====\nIn the Far East, Russians became active in fur trapping in [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]] and the [[Kuril Islands]]. This spurred Russian interest in opening trade with Japan to the south for supplies and food. In 1783, storms drove a Japanese sea captain, [[Daikokuya K\u014dday\u016b]], ashore in the [[Aleutian Islands]], at that time Russian territory. Russian local authorities helped his party, and the Russian government decided to use him as a trade envoy. On 28 June 1791, Catherine granted Daikokuya an audience at [[Tsarskoye Selo]]. Subsequently, in 1792, the Russian government dispatched a trade mission to Japan, led by [[Adam Laxman]]. The [[Tokugawa shogunate]] received the mission, but negotiations failed.\n====Relations with China====\nThe [[Qianlong Emperor]] of China was committed to an expansionist policy in Central Asia and saw the Russian empire as a potential rival, making for difficult and unfriendly relations between Beijing and St. Petersburg.<ref>{{harvnb|Lim|2013|pp=55}}</ref> In 1762, he unilaterally abrogated the [[Treaty of Kyakhta (1727)|Treaty of Kyakhta]], which governed the caravan trade between the two empires.<ref>{{harvnb|Lim|2013|pp=55-56}}</ref> Another source of tension were Dzungar Mongol fugitives from the Chinese state who took refuge with the Russians.<ref>{{harvnb|Lim|2013|pp=56}}</ref> The [[Dzungar genocide]] by the Qing state had led many Dzungars to seek sanctuary in the Russian empire, and was one of the reasons for the abrogation of the Treaty of Kyakhta.

Historian Francois Cruzet writes that Russia under Catherine:\n{{quote|had neither a free peasantry, nor a significant middle class, nor legal norms hospitable to private enterprise. Still, there was a start of industry, mainly textiles around Moscow and ironworks in the Ural Mountains, with a labor force mainly of serfs, bound to the works.<ref>{{cite book|author=Fran\u00e7ois Crouzet|title=A History of the European Economy, 1000\u20132000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NiVWqSTea8oC&pg=PA75|year=2001|publisher=U of Virginia Press|page=75|isbn=978-0-8139-2190-7}}</ref>}}\n\nCatherine strongly encouraged the migration of the [[Volga Germans]], farmers from Germany who settled mostly in the Volga River Valley region. They indeed helped modernise the sector that totally dominated the Russian economy. They introduced numerous innovations regarding wheat production and flour milling, tobacco culture, sheep raising, and small-scale manufacturing.<ref>\"The Economic Contributions of the German Russians to the Imperial Russian Economy.\" ''Journal of the American Historical Society of Germans from Russia'' (2012) 35#2 pp. 1\u201334</ref><ref>Fred C. Koch, ''The Volga Germans: in Russia and the Americas, from 1763 to the present'' (Penn State Press, 2010).</ref>\n\nIn 1768, the [[:Saint Petersburg State University of Economics and Finance#Assignation Bank|Assignation Bank]] was given the task of issuing the first government paper money. It opened in St. Petersburg and Moscow in 1769. Several bank branches were afterwards established in other towns, called government towns. Paper notes were issued upon payment of similar sums in copper money, which were also refunded upon the presentation of those notes.\nThe emergence of these [[Assignation rubles]] was necessary due to large government spending on military needs, which led to a shortage of silver in the treasury (transactions, especially in foreign trade, were conducted almost exclusively in silver and gold coins). Assignation rubles circulated on equal footing with the silver ruble; a market exchange rate for these two currencies was ongoing. The use of these notes continued until 1849.<ref>James A.

The [[Hermitage Museum]], which {{As of|2009 |alt=now}} occupies the whole [[Winter Palace]], began as Catherine's personal collection. The Empress was a great lover of art and books, and ordered the construction the Hermitage in 1770 to house her ever expanding collection of paintings, sculpture, and books.<ref>{{harvnb|Rounding|2006|pp=222}}</ref> By 1790, the Hermitage was the home to 38,000 books, 10,000 gems, 10,000 drawings and two wings devoted to her collections of \"curiosities\".<ref>{{harvnb|Brechka|1969|pp=47}}</ref> Another interest was the English style of gardens, as she ordered the first \"English garden\" planted at Tsarskoye Selo in May 1770.<ref>{{harvnb|Rounding|2006|pp=222}}</ref> In a letter to Voltaire in 1772, she wrote: \"Right now I adore English gardens, curves, gentle slopes, ponds in the form of lakes, archipelagos on dry land, and I have a profound scorn for straight lines, symmetric avenues.

The leading economists of her day, such as [[Arthur Young (writer)|Arthur Young]] and [[Jacques Necker]], became foreign members of the [[Free Economic Society]], established on her suggestion in Saint Petersburg in 1765. She recruited the scientists [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Peter Simon Pallas]] from Berlin and [[Anders Johan Lexell]] from Sweden to the Russian capital.\n\nCatherine enlisted Voltaire to her cause, and corresponded with him for 15 years, from her accession to his death in 1778. He lauded her accomplishments, calling her \"The Star of the North\" and the \"[[Semiramis]] of Russia\" (in reference to the legendary Queen of [[Babylon]], a subject on which he published a tragedy in 1768). Though she never met him face to face, she mourned him bitterly when he died. She acquired his collection of books from his heirs, and placed them in the [[National Library of Russia]].\n\nCatherine read three sorts of books, namely those for pleasure, those for information and those to provide her with a philosophy.<ref>{{harvnb|Brechka|1969|pp=43}}</ref> In the first category, she read romances and comedies that were popular at the time, many of which were regarded as \"inconsequential\" by the critics both then and since.<ref>{{harvnb|Brechka|1969|pp=43}}</ref> She especially liked the work of German comic writers such as [[Moritz August von Th\u00fcmmel]] and [[Christoph Friedrich Nicolai]].<ref>{{harvnb|Brechka|1969|pp=43}}</ref> In the second category fell the work of [[Denis Diderot]], [[Jacques Necker]], [[Johann Bernhard Basedow]] and [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]].<ref>{{harvnb|Brechka|1969|pp=44}}</ref> Catherine expressed some frustration with the economists she read for what she regarded as their impractical theories, writing on the margin on one of Necker's books that if it was possible to solve all of the state's economic problems in one day, she would have done so a long time ago.<ref>{{harvnb|Brechka|1969|pp=44}}</ref> For information about particular nations that interested her, she read [[Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville]]'s ''Memoirs de Chine'' to learn about the vast and wealthy Chinese empire that bordered her empire; [[Fran\u00e7ois Baron de Tott]]'s ''Memoires de les Turcs et les Tartares'' for information about the Ottoman Empire and the Crimean khanate; the books of [[Frederick the Great]] praising himself to learn about Frederick just as much as to learn about Prussia; and the pamphlets of [[Benjamin Franklin]] denouncing the British Crown to understand the reasons for the American Revolution.<ref>{{harvnb|Brechka|1969|pp=44}}</ref> In the third category fell the work of [[Voltaire]], [[Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm]], [[Ferdinando Galiani]], [[Nicolas Baudeau]], and Sir [[William Blackstone]].<ref>{{harvnb|Brechka|1969|pp=44-45}}</ref> For philosophy, she liked books promoting what has been called \"enlightened despotism\" as she embraced as her ideal of an autocratic, but reformist government that would operate according to the rule of law, not the whims of the ruler, hence her interest in Blackstone's legal commentaries.<ref>{{harvnb|Brechka|1969|pp=44-45}}</ref>            \n\nWithin a few months of her accession in 1762, having heard the French government threatened to stop the publication of the famous French ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'' on account of its irreligious spirit, Catherine proposed to Diderot that he should complete his great work in Russia under her protection.\n\nFour years later, in 1766, she endeavoured to embody in legislation the principles of Enlightenment she learned from studying the French philosophers. She called together at Moscow a Grand Commission\u2014almost a consultative parliament\u2014composed of 652 members of all classes (officials, nobles, [[Bourgeoisie|burghers]], and [[peasant]]s) and of various nationalities. The Commission had to consider the needs of the Russian Empire and the means of satisfying them. The Empress herself prepared the [[Nakaz|\"Instructions for the Guidance of the Assembly\"]], pillaging (as she frankly admitted) the philosophers of Western Europe, especially [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] and [[Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria|Cesare Beccaria]].\n\n[[File:Portrait of Empress Catherine II(a).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Catherine II]]\nAs many of the democratic principles frightened her more moderate and experienced advisors, she refrained from immediately putting them into practice. After holding more than 200 sittings, the so-called Commission dissolved without getting beyond the realm of theory.\n\nIn spite of this, Catherine began issuing codes to address some of the modernisation trends suggested in her [[Nakaz]]. In 1775, the Empress decreed a Statute for the Administration of the Provinces of the Russian Empire. The statute sought to efficiently govern Russia by increasing population and dividing the country into provinces and districts. By the end of her reign, 50 provinces and nearly 500 districts were created, more than double the government officials were appointed, and they were spending six times as much as previously on local government. In 1785, Catherine conferred on the nobility the [[Charter to the Gentry|Charter to the Nobility]], increasing further the power of the landed oligarchs. Nobles in each district elected a Marshal of the Nobility, who spoke on their behalf to the monarch on issues of concern to them, mainly economic ones. In the same year, Catherine issued the Charter of the Towns, which distributed all people into six groups as a way to limit the power of nobles and create a middle estate. Catherine also issued the Code of Commercial Navigation and Salt Trade Code of 1781, the Police Ordinance of 1782, and the Statute of National Education of 1786. In 1777, the Empress described to Voltaire her legal innovations within a backward Russia as progressing \"little by little\".\n\nDuring Catherine's reign, Russians imported and studied the classical and European influences that inspired the [[Russian Enlightenment]]. [[Gavrila Derzhavin]], [[Denis Fonvizin]], and [[Ippolit Bogdanovich]] laid the groundwork for the great writers of the 19th century, especially for [[Alexander Pushkin]]. Catherine became a great patron of [[Russian opera]]. When [[Alexander Radishchev]] published his ''[[Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow]]'' in 1790 (one year after the start of the [[French Revolution]]) and warned of uprisings because of the deplorable social conditions of the peasants held as [[serfdom|serfs]], Catherine [[exile]]d him to [[Siberia]].\n\n[[File:Bolshoy Teatr.jpg|thumb|The Bolshoi Theatre in the early 19th century]]\nCatherine also received [[Elisabeth Vig\u00e9e Le Brun]] (formerly court painter to [[Marie Antoinette]]) at her [[Tsarskoye Selo]] residence in [[St Petersburg]], by whom she was painted shortly before her death. Madame Vig\u00e9e Le Brun vividly describes the empress in her memoirs: \"the sight of this famous woman so impressed me that I found it impossible to think of anything: I could only stare at her. Firstly I was very surprised at her small stature; I had imagined her to be very tall, as great as her fame. She was also very fat, but her face was still beautiful, and she wore her white hair up, framing it perfectly. Her genius seemed to rest on her forehead, which was both high and wide. Her eyes were soft and sensitive, her nose quite Greek, her colour high and her features expressive. She addressed me immediately in a voice full of sweetness, if a little throaty: \"I am delighted to welcome you here, Madame, your reputation runs before you. I am very fond of the arts, especially painting. I am no connoisseur, but I am a great art lover.\"\n\nMadame Vig\u00e9e Le Brun also describes the empress at a gala: \"The double doors opened and the Empress appeared. I have said that she was quite small, and yet on the days when she made her public appearances, with her head held high, her eagle-like stare and a countenance accustomed to command, all this gave her such an air of majesty that to me she might have been Queen of the World; she wore the sashes of three orders, and her costume was both simple and regal; it consisted of a muslin tunic embroidered with gold fastened by a diamond belt, and the full sleeves were folded back in the Asiatic style. Over this tunic she wore a red velvet dolman with very short sleeves. The bonnet which held her white hair was not decorated with ribbons, but with the most beautiful diamonds.\"\n\n=== Education ===\nCatherine held western European philosophies and culture close to her heart, and she wanted to surround herself with like-minded people within Russia.<ref>{{harvnb|Max|2006|pp=19\u201324}}</ref> She believed a 'new kind of person' could be created by inculcating Russian children with European education. Catherine believed education could change the hearts and minds of the Russian people and turn them away from backwardness. This meant developing individuals both intellectually and morally, providing them knowledge and skills, and fostering a sense of civic responsibility.<ref>Nicholas V. Riasanovsky, ''A History of Russia'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2011).</ref>\n\n[[File:E. Vorontsova-Dashkova by Dm. Levitsky (1784, Hillwood).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Yekaterina Vorontsova-Dashkova]], the closest female friend of Empress Catherine and a major figure of the Russian Enlightenment]]\n\nCatherine appointed [[Ivan Betskoy]] as her advisor on educational matters.<ref>{{harvnb|Madariaga|1979|pp=369\u201395}}</ref> Through him, she collected information from Russia and other countries about educational institutions. She also established a commission composed of T.N. Teplov, T. von Klingstedt, F.G. Dilthey, and the historian G. Muller. She consulted British education pioneers, particularly the Rev. [[Daniel Dumaresq]] and Dr John Brown.<ref>N. Hans, \"Dumaresq, Brown and Some Early Educational Projects of Catherine II\", ''Slavonic and East European Review'' (1961) : 229\u201335.</ref> In 1764, she sent for Dumaresq to come to Russia and then appointed him to the educational commission. The commission studied the reform projects previously installed by I.I. Shuvalov under Elizabeth and under Peter III. They submitted recommendations for the establishment of a general system of education for all Russian orthodox subjects from the age of 5 to 18, excluding serfs.<ref>{{harvnb|Madariaga|1979|p=374}}</ref> However, no action was taken on any recommendations put forth by the commission due to the calling of the Legislative Commission. In July 1765, Dumaresq wrote to Dr. John Brown about the commission's problems and received a long reply containing very general and sweeping suggestions for education and social reforms in Russia. Dr. Brown argued, in a democratic country, education ought to be under the state's control and based on an education code. He also placed great emphasis on the \"proper and effectual education of the female sex\"; two years prior, Catherine had commissioned Ivan Betskoy to draw up the General Programme for the Education of Young People of Both Sexes.<ref>Hans, \u201cDumaresq\u201d, 233.</ref> This work emphasised the fostering of the creation of a 'new kind of people' raised in isolation from the damaging influence of a backward Russian environment.<ref>{{harvnb|Dixon|2009|p=130}}</ref> The Establishment of the Moscow Foundling Home (Moscow Orphanage) was the first attempt at achieving that goal. It was charged with admitting destitute and extramarital children  to educate them in any way the state deemed fit. Since the Moscow Foundling Home was not established as a state-funded institution, it represented an opportunity to experiment with new educational theories. However, the Moscow Foundling Home was unsuccessful, mainly due to extremely high mortality rates, which prevented many of the children from living long enough to develop into the enlightened subjects the state desired.<ref>Catherine Evtuhov, ''A History of Russia: Peoples, Legends, Events, Forces'' (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2004).</ref>\n\n[[File:Moscow Orphanage asv2018-01.jpg|thumb|The [[Moscow Orphanage]]]]\n[[File:Galaktionov Smolny institute 1823.jpg|thumb|The [[Smolny Institute]], the first Russian [[Institute for Noble Maidens]] and the first European state higher education institution for women]]\nNot long after the Moscow Foundling Home, at the instigation of her factotum, [[Ivan Betskoy]], she wrote a manual for the education of young children, drawing from the ideas of [[John Locke]], and founded the famous [[Smolny Institute]] in 1764, first of its kind in Russia. At first, the Institute only admitted young girls of the noble elite, but eventually it began to admit girls of the petit-[[bourgeoisie]], as well.<ref>{{harvnb|Max|2006|p=20}}</ref> The girls who attended the Smolny Institute, Smolyanki, were often accused of being ignorant of anything that went on in the world outside the walls of the Smolny buildings. Within the walls of the Institute, they were taught impeccable French, musicianship, dancing, and complete awe of the Monarch. At the Institute, enforcement of strict discipline was central to its philosophy. Running and games were forbidden, and the building was kept particularly cold because too much warmth was  believed to be harmful to the developing body, as was excess play.<ref>{{harvnb|Max|2006|p=21}}</ref>\n\nDuring 1768\u20131774, no progress was made in setting up a national school system.<ref>{{harvnb|Madariaga|1979|p=379}}</ref> Catherine continued to investigate educational theory and practice of other countries. She made many educational reforms despite the lack of a national school system. The remodelling of the Cadet Corps 1766 initiated many educational reforms. It then began to take children from a very young age and educate them until the age of 21. The curriculum was broadened from the professional military curriculum to include the sciences, philosophy, ethics, history, and international law. This policy in the Cadet Corps influenced the teaching in the Naval Cadet Corps and in the Engineering and Artillery Schools. After the war and the defeat of Pugachev, Catherine laid the obligation to establish schools at the ''guberniya''\u2014a provincial subdivision of the Russian empire ruled by a governor\u2014on the Boards of Social Welfare set up with the participation of elected representatives from the three free estates.<ref>{{harvnb|Madariaga|1979|p=380}}</ref>\n\nBy 1782, Catherine arranged another advisory commission to study the information gathered about the educational systems of many different countries.<ref>{{harvnb|Madariaga|1979|p=383}}</ref> A system produced by a mathematician, [[Franz Aepinus]], stood out in particular. He was strongly in favor of the adoption of the Austrian three-tier model of trivial, real, and normal schools at the village, town, and provincial capital levels. In addition to the advisory commission, Catherine established a Commission of National Schools under [[Pyotr Zavadovsky]]. This commission was charged with organizing a national school network, training the teachers, and providing the textbooks. On 5 August 1786, the Russian Statute of National Education was promulgated.<ref name=\"Madariaga, Foundation, 385\">{{harvnb|Madariaga|1979|p=385}}</ref> The statute established a two-tier network of high schools and primary schools in ''guberniya'' capitals that were free of charge, open to all of the free classes (not serfs), and co-educational. It also regulated, in detail, the subjects to be taught at every age and the method of teaching. In addition to the textbooks translated by the commission, teachers were provided with the \"Guide to Teachers\". This work, divided into four parts, dealt with teaching methods, the subjects taught, the behaviour of the teacher, and the running of a school.<ref name=\"Madariaga, Foundation, 385\" />\n\nJudgment of the 19th century was generally critical, claiming that Catherine failed to supply enough money to support her educational programme.<ref>{{harvnb|Madariaga|1979|p=391}}</ref> Two years after the implementation of Catherine's programme, a member of the National Commission inspected the institutions established. Throughout Russia, the inspectors encountered a patchy response. While the nobility put up appreciable amounts of money for these institutions, they preferred to send their own children to private, more prestigious institutions. Also, the townspeople tended to turn against the junior schools and their pedagogical{{Clarify|date=August 2019}} methods. An estimated 62,000 pupils were being educated in some 549 state institutions near the end of Catherine's reign. This was only a minuscule number of people compared to the size of the Russian population.<ref>{{harvnb|Madariaga|1979|p=394}}</ref>\n\n=== Religious affairs ===\n[[File:Katharina II., die Gro\u00dfe.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Catherine II in the Russian national costume]]\n\nCatherine's apparent whole-hearted adoption of all things Russian (including [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodoxy]]) may have prompted her personal indifference to religion. She nationalised all of the church lands to help pay for her wars, largely emptied the monasteries, and forced most of the remaining clergymen to survive as farmers or from fees for baptisms and other services.  Very few members of the nobility entered the Church, which became even less important than before. She did not allow dissenters to build chapels, and she suppressed religious dissent after the onset of the French Revolution.<ref name=\"madariaga111\">{{harvnb|Madariaga|1981|pp=111\u201322}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Catherine promoted Christianity in her anti-Ottoman policy, promoting the protection and fostering of Christians under Turkish rule. She placed strictures on Roman Catholics (''[[Ukase|ukaz]]'' of 23 February 1769), mainly Polish, and attempted to assert and extend state control over them in the wake of the partitions of Poland.<ref name=newadvent>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13253a.htm|title=The Religion of Russia|accessdate=24 March 2007}}</ref> Nevertheless, Catherine's Russia provided an asylum and a base for regrouping to the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] following the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|suppression of the Jesuits]] in most of Europe in 1773.<ref name=newadvent />\n\n==== Islam ====\n{{Seealso|Islam in Russia}}\n[[File:\u0411\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043a\u0438 \u0432 \u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0435.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Bashkirs|Bashkir]] riders from the Ural steppes]]\nCatherine took many different approaches to Islam during her reign. Between 1762 and 1773, Muslims were actively prohibited from owning any Orthodox serfs. They were also pressured into Orthodoxy through monetary incentives.<ref>{{harvnb|Fisher|1968|p=544}}</ref> Catherine promised more serfs of all religions, as well as amnesty for convicts, if Muslims chose to convert to Orthodoxy.<ref name=\"Fisher, Alan W. 1968\">{{harvnb|Fisher|1968|p=545}}</ref> However, the Legislative Commission of 1767 offered several seats to people professing the Islamic faith. This commission promised to protect their religious rights, but did not do so. Many Orthodox peasants felt threatened by the sudden change, and burned mosques as a sign of their displeasure.<ref name=\"Fisher, Alan W. 1968\" /> Catherine chose to assimilate Islam into the state rather than eliminate it when public outcry became too disruptive. After the \"Toleration of All Faiths\" Edict of 1773, Muslims were permitted to build mosques and practise all of their traditions, the most obvious of these being the pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], which had been denied previously.<ref>{{harvnb|Fisher|1968|p=546}}</ref> Catherine created the [[Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly]] to help regulate Muslim-populated regions, as well as regulate the instruction and ideals of mullahs. The positions on the Assembly were appointed and paid for by Catherine and her government, as a way of regulating the religious affairs of her nation.<ref>{{harvnb|Fisher|1968|p=548}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Russian Empire 1792 Map.jpg|thumb|280px|Russian Empire in 1792]]\nIn 1785, Catherine approved the subsidising of new mosques and new town settlements for Muslims. This was another attempt to organise and passively control the outer fringes of her country. By building new settlements with mosques placed in them, Catherine attempted to ground many of the [[nomad]]ic people who wandered through southern Russia.<ref>{{harvnb|Fisher|1968|p=549}}</ref> In 1786, she assimilated the Islamic schools into the Russian public school system, to be regulated by the government. The plan was another attempt to force nomadic people to settle. This allowed the Russian government to control more people, especially those who previously had not fallen under the jurisdiction of Russian law.<ref>{{harvnb|Madariaga|1981|pp=508\u201311}}</ref>\n\n==== Judaism ====\n{{Seealso|Judaism in Russia}}\nRussia often treated Judaism as a separate entity, where Jews were maintained with a separate legal and bureaucratic system.  Although the government knew that Judaism existed, Catherine and her advisers had no real definition of what a \"Jew\" is, since the term meant many things during her reign.<ref>{{harvnb|Klier|1976|p=505}}</ref> Judaism was a small, if not nonexistent, religion in Russia until 1772. When Catherine agreed to the [[First Partition of Poland]], the large new Jewish element was treated as a separate people, defined by their religion. In keeping with their treatment in Poland, Catherine allowed the Jews to separate themselves from Orthodox society, with certain restrictions. She levied additional taxes on the followers of Judaism; if a family converted to the Orthodox faith, that additional tax was lifted.<ref>{{harvnb|Klier|1976|pp=506\u201307}}</ref> Jewish members of society were required to pay double the tax of their Orthodox neighbours. Converted Jews could gain permission to enter the merchant class and farm as free peasants under Russian rule.<ref>{{harvnb|Klier|1976|p=507}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Madariaga|1981|pp=504\u201308}}</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to assimilate the Jews into Russia's economy, Catherine included them under the rights and laws of the Charter of the Towns of 1782.<ref>{{harvnb|Klier|1976|p=511}}</ref> Orthodox Russians disliked the inclusion of Judaism, mainly for economic reasons. Catherine tried to keep the Jews away from certain economic spheres, even under the guise of equality; in 1790, she banned Jewish citizens from Moscow's middle class.<ref>{{harvnb|Klier|1976|p=512}}</ref>\n\nIn 1785, Catherine declared Jews to be officially foreigners, with foreigners' rights.<ref>{{harvnb|Klier|1976|p=515}}</ref> This re-established the separate identity that Judaism maintained in Russia throughout the Jewish [[Haskalah]]. Catherine's decree also denied Jews the rights of an Orthodox or naturalised citizen of Russia. Taxes doubled again for those of Jewish descent in 1794, and Catherine officially declared that Jews bore no relation to Russians.\n\n==== Russian Orthodoxy ====\n[[File:Kingsobor.jpg|thumb|left|upright|St. Catherine Cathedral in [[Kingisepp]], an example of Late Baroque architecture]]\n\nIn many ways, the Orthodox Church fared no better than its foreign counterparts during the reign of Catherine. Under her leadership, she completed what Peter III had started: the church's lands were expropriated, and the budget of both monasteries and bishoprics were controlled by the [[College of Economy]].<ref>Raeff, Mark. ''Catherine the Great: A Profile'' (New York: Hill and Wang, 1972), 293.</ref> Endowments from the government replaced income from privately held lands. The endowments were often much less than the original intended amount.<ref name=\"Hosking 231\">{{harvnb|Hosking|1997|p=231}}</ref> She closed 569 of 954 monasteries, of which only 161 received government money. Only 400,000 rubles of church wealth were paid back.<ref>Richard Pipes, ''Russia under the old regime'', p. 242</ref> While other religions (such as Islam) received invitations to the Legislative Commission, the Orthodox clergy did not receive a single seat.<ref name=\"Hosking 231\" /> Their place in government was restricted severely during the years of Catherine's reign.<ref name=\"madariaga111\" />\n\nIn 1762, to help mend the rift between the Orthodox church and a sect that called themselves the [[Old Believers]], Catherine passed an act that allowed Old Believers to practise their faith openly without interference.<ref name=\"Raeff, Marc 1972\">[[Marc Raeff]],  ''Catherine the Great: A Profile'' (New York: Hill and Wang, 1972), 294.</ref> While claiming religious tolerance, she intended to recall the Believers into the official church. They refused to comply, and in 1764, she deported over 20,000 Old Believers to Siberia on the grounds of their faith.<ref name=\"Raeff, Marc 1972\" /> In later years, Catherine amended her thoughts. Old Believers were allowed to hold elected municipal positions after the Urban Charter of 1785, and she promised religious freedom to those who wished to settle in Russia.<ref>{{harvnb|Hosking|1997|p=237}}</ref><ref>Raef, ''Catherine the Great: A Profile'' p. 296.</ref>\n\nReligious education was also strictly reviewed. At first, she simply attempted to revise clerical studies, proposing a reform of religious schools. This reform never progressed beyond the planning stages. By 1786, Catherine excluded all religion and clerical studies programmes from lay education.<ref>Raeff, Marc. ''Catherine the Great: A Profile'' (New York: Hill and Wang, 1972), 298.</ref> By separating the public interests from those of the church, Catherine began a secularisation of the day-to-day workings of Russia. She transformed the clergy from a group that wielded great power over the Russian government and its people to a segregated community forced to depend on the state for compensation.<ref name=\"Hosking 231\" />\n\n=== Personal life ===\n[[File:Orlov greg.jpeg|thumb|upright|Count [[Grigory Orlov]], by [[Fyodor Rokotov]]]]\n\nCatherine, throughout her long reign, took many lovers, often elevating them to high positions<ref>{{Cite journal |first=John |last=Alexander |title=Catherine the Great, life and legend |page=224 |ref=harv}}</ref> for as long as they held her interest, and then pensioning them off with gifts of serfs and large estates. The percentage of state money spent on the court increased from 10.4% in 1767 to 11.4% in 1781 to 13.5% in 1795. Catherine gave away 66,000 serfs from 1762\u201372, 202,000 from 1773\u201393, and 100,000 in one day: 18 August 1795.<ref name=\"Pipes\">{{Cite journal|first=Richard|last=Pipes|title=Russia under the old regime|ref=harv}}</ref>{{rp |119}} Catherine bought the support of the [[bureaucracy]]. From 19 April 1764, any bureaucrat holding the same rank for seven years or more was instantly promoted. On 13 September 1767, Catherine decreed that after seven years in one rank, civil servants would be automatically promoted regardless of office or merit.<ref>Richard Pipes, Russia under the old regime, page 135</ref>\n\nAfter her affair with her lover and adviser [[Grigory Potyomkin|Grigori Alexandrovich Potemkin]] ended in 1776, he allegedly selected a candidate-lover for her who had the physical beauty and mental faculties to hold her interest (such as [[Alexander Dmitriev-Mamonov]] and Nicholas Alexander Suk<ref>Bushkovitch, Paul. ''A Concise History of Russia''. New York, Oxford University Press, 2011</ref>). Some of these men loved her in return, and she always showed generosity towards them, even after the affair ended. One of her lovers, [[Pyotr Zavadovsky]], received 50,000 rubles, a pension of 5,000 rubles, and 4,000 peasants in Ukraine after she dismissed him in 1777.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Farquhar|first=Michael|year=2001|title=A Treasure of Royal Scandals|page=[https://archive.org/details/treasuryofroyals00farq/page/7 7]|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|place=New York|isbn=978-0-7394-2025-6|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/treasuryofroyals00farq/page/7}}</ref> The last of her lovers, [[Platon Zubov|Prince Zubov]], was 40 years her junior.

New  York: Oxford University Press, 1989, pp. 332\u201335</ref>\n\nCatherine kept her illegitimate son by Grigori Orlov ([[Bobrinsky|Alexis Bobrinsky]], later elevated to Count Bobrinsky by Paul I) near [[Tula, Russia|Tula]], away from her court.\n\n==== Poniatowski ====\n[[File:Stanislaw poniatowski bacciarelli.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]], the last King of [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]]]]\n\nSir [[Charles Hanbury Williams]], the British ambassador to Russia, offered Stanis\u0142aw Poniatowski a place in the embassy in return for gaining Catherine as an ally.  Poniatowski, through his mother's side, came from the [[Czartoryski family]], prominent members of the pro-Russian faction in Poland; Poniatowski and Catherine were eighth cousins, twice removed by their mutual ancestor King [[Christian I of Denmark]], by virtue of Poniatowski's maternal descent from the Scottish [[House of Stuart]]. Catherine, 26 years old and already married to the then-Grand Duke Peter for some 10 years, met the 22-year-old Poniatowski in 1755, therefore well before encountering the Orlov brothers. In 1757, Poniatowski served in the British forces during the [[Seven Years' War]], thus severing close relationships with Catherine. She bore him a daughter named Anna Petrovna in December 1757 (not to be confused with [[Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna of Russia]], the daughter of Peter I's second marriage).\n\nKing [[Augustus III of Poland]] died in 1763, so Poland needed to elect a new ruler. Catherine supported Poniatowski as a candidate to become the next king.  She sent the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian army]] into Poland to avoid possible disputes. Russia invaded Poland on 26 August 1764, threatening to fight, and imposing Poniatowski as king. Poniatowski accepted the throne, and thereby put himself under Catherine's control. News of Catherine's plan spread and Frederick II (others say the Ottoman [[sultan]]) warned her that if she tried to conquer Poland by marrying Poniatowski, all of Europe would oppose her. She had no intention of marrying him, having already given birth to Orlov's child and to the Grand Duke Paul by then.\n\nPrussia (through the agency of [[Prince Henry of Prussia (1726\u20131802)|Prince Henry]]), Russia (under Catherine), and Austria (under [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]]) began preparing the ground for the partitions of Poland. In the first partition, 1772, the three powers split {{convert|20000|sqmi|km2|order=flip|abbr=on}} between them. Russia got territories east of the line connecting, more or less, [[Riga]]\u2013[[Polotsk]]\u2013[[Mogilev]]. In the second partition, in 1793, Russia received the most land, from west of [[Minsk]] almost to [[Kiev]] and down the river [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]], leaving some spaces of [[steppe]] down south in front of [[Ochakiv|Ochakov]], on the [[Black Sea]]. Later uprisings in Poland led to the third partition in 1795, one year before Catherine's death. Poland ceased to exist as an independent nation [[Polish Independence Day|until 1918]], in the aftermath of World War I.\n\n==== Orlov ====\n[[File:Alexei borinsky.jpeg|thumb|upright|Catherine the Great's natural son by Count Orlov, [[Bobrinsky|Aleksey Grigorievich Bobrinsky]] (1762\u20131813 in his estate of Bogoroditsk, near Tula), born three months before the deposition and assassination by the Orlov brothers of her husband Peter III]]\n\n[[Grigory Orlov]], the grandson of a rebel in the [[Streltsy Uprising]] (1698) against Peter the Great, distinguished himself in the [[Battle of Zorndorf]] (25 August 1758), receiving three wounds. He represented an opposite to Peter's pro-Prussian sentiment, with which Catherine disagreed. By 1759, Catherine and he had become lovers; no one told Catherine's husband, the Grand Duke Peter. Catherine saw Orlov as very useful, and he became instrumental in 28 June 1762 ''coup d\u2019\u00e9tat'' against her husband, but she preferred to remain the Dowager Empress of Russia, rather than marrying anyone.\n\nGrigory Orlov and his other three brothers found themselves rewarded with titles, money, swords, and other gifts, but Catherine did not marry Grigory, who proved inept at politics and useless when asked for advice. He received a palace in Saint Petersburg when Catherine became Empress.\n\nOrlov died in 1783. Their son, Aleksey Grygoriovich Bobrinsky (1762\u20131813), had one daughter, [[Maria Alexeyeva Bobrinsky]] (Bobrinskaya) (1798\u20131835), who married in 1819 the 34-year-old Prince [[Nikolai Gagarin|Nikolai Sergeevich Gagarin]] (London, England, 1784\u20131842) who took part in the [[Battle of Borodino]] (7 September 1812) against [[Napoleon]], and later served as ambassador in [[Turin]], the capital of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]].\n\n==== Potemkin ====\n[[File:1000 Potiomkin.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Catherine II and Potemkin on the [[Millennium of Russia|Millennium Monument]] in [[Novgorod]]]]\n[[Grigory Potemkin]] was involved in the ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' of 1762. In 1772, Catherine's close friends informed her of Orlov's affairs with other women, and she dismissed him. By the winter of 1773, the [[Pugachev's Rebellion|Pugachev revolt]] had started to threaten. Catherine's son Paul had also started gaining support; both of these trends threatened her power. She called Potemkin for help\u2014mostly military\u2014and he became devoted to her.\n\nIn 1772, Catherine wrote to Potemkin. Days earlier, she had found out about an uprising in the Volga region. She appointed General [[Aleksandr Bibikov]] to put down the uprising, but she needed Potemkin's advice on [[military strategy]]. Potemkin quickly gained positions and awards. Russian poets wrote about his virtues, the court praised him, foreign ambassadors fought for his favour, and his family moved into the palace. He later became the de facto absolute ruler of [[Novorossiya|New Russia]], governing its colonisation.\n\nIn 1780, the son of Holy Roman Empress Maria Theresa, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]], toyed with the idea of determining whether or not to enter an alliance with Russia, and asked to meet Catherine. Potemkin had the task of briefing him and travelling with him to Saint Petersburg. Potemkin also convinced Catherine to expand the universities in Russia to increase the number of scientists.\n\nPotemkin fell very ill in August 1783. Catherine worried  he would not finish his work developing the south as he had planned. Potemkin died at the age of 52 in 1791.\n\n=== Serfs ===\n{{Seealso|Serfdom in Russia}}\nAccording to a census taken from 1754 to 1762, Catherine owned 500,000 serfs.  A further 2.8 million belonged to the Russian state.<ref>Massie, Robert K. (2011). ''Catherine the Great: Portrait of a Woman''. New York: Random House. p. 302</ref>\n\n==== Rights and conditions ====\n[[File:Supplice du Grand Knout.jpg|thumb|upright|Punishment with a [[knout]]]]At the time of Catherine's reign, the landowning noble class owned the serfs, who were bound to the land  they tilled. Children of serfs were born into [[serfdom]] and worked the same land their parents had. The serfs had very limited rights, but they were not exactly slaves. While the state did not technically allow them to own possessions, some serfs were able to accumulate enough wealth to pay for their freedom.<ref>Elise Kimerling Wirtschafter, \u201cLegal Identity and the Possession of Serfs in Imperial Russia,\u201d ''The Journal of Modern History'', Vol. 70, No. 3 (September 1998), 564</ref> The understanding of law in [[imperial Russia]] by all sections of society was often weak, confused, or nonexistent, particularly in the provinces where most serfs lived. This is why some serfs were able to do things such as accumulate wealth. To become serfs, people would give up their freedoms to a landowner in exchange for their protection and support in times of hardship. In addition, they would receive land to till, but would be taxed a certain percentage of their crops to give to their landowners. These were the privileges a serf was entitled to and that nobles were bound to carry out. All of this was true before Catherine's reign, and this is the system she inherited.\n\nCatherine did initiate some changes to serfdom. If a noble did not live up to his side of the deal, the serfs could file complaints against him by following the proper channels of law.<ref>Isabel de Madriaga, \u201cCatherine II and the Serfs: A Reconsideration of Some Problems\u201d, ''The Slavonic and East European Review'', Vol. 52, No. 126 (Jan. 1974), 48\u201351</ref> Catherine gave them this new right, but in exchange they could no longer appeal directly to her. She did this because she did not want to be bothered by the peasantry, but did not want to give them reason to revolt. In this act she gave the serfs a legitimate bureaucratic status they had lacked before.<ref>Witschafter, \u201cLegal Identity\u201d, 563\u201364</ref> Some serfs were able to use their new status to their advantage. For example, serfs could apply to be freed if they were under illegal ownership, and non-nobles were not allowed to own serfs.<ref>Witschafter, \u201cLegal Identity\u201d, 565\u201367</ref> Some serfs did apply for freedom and were successful. In addition, some governors listened to the complaints of serfs and punished nobles, but this was by no means universal.\n\nOther than these, the rights of a serf were very limited. A landowner could punish his serfs at his discretion, and under Catherine the Great gained the ability to sentence his serfs to hard labour in Siberia, a punishment normally reserved for convicted criminals.<ref>Madriaga, \u201cCatherine II\u201d, 42\u201346</ref> The only thing a noble could not do to his serfs was to kill them. The life of a serf belonged to the state. Historically, when the serfs faced problems they could not solve on their own (such as abusive masters), they often appealed to the autocrat, and continued doing so during Catherine's reign, though she signed legislation prohibiting it.<ref>Madriaga, \u201cCatherine II\u201d, 48\u201351</ref> Although she did not want to communicate directly with the serfs, she did create some measures to improve their conditions as a class and reduce the size of the institution of serfdom. For example, she took action to limit the number of new serfs; she eliminated many ways for people to become serfs, culminating in the manifesto of 17 March 1775, which prohibited a serf who had once been freed from becoming a serf again.<ref>Madriaga, \u201cCatherine II\u201d, 35</ref> However, she also restricted the freedoms of many peasants. During her reign, Catherine gave away many state-owned peasants to become private serfs (owned by a landowner), and while their ownership changed hands, a serf's location never did. However, peasants owned by the state generally had more freedoms than those owned by a noble.\n\nWhile the majority of serfs were farmers bound to the land, a noble could also have his serfs sent away to learn a trade or be educated at a school, in addition to employing them at businesses that paid wages.<ref>Witschafter, \u201cLegal Identity\u201d, 567</ref> This happened more often during Catherine's reign because of the new schools she established. Only in this way could a serf leave the farm for which he was responsible.\n\n==== Attitudes towards Catherine ====\n[[File:\u041f\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0421\u0443\u0434 \u041f\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0432\u0430 (\u0413\u0418\u041c).jpg|thumb|Pugachev's rebellion]]\n\nThe attitude of the serfs towards their [[Autocracy|autocrat]] had historically been a positive one.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Field|first1=Daniel|title=Rebels in the Name of the Tsar|date=1976|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-395-21986-7|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Rebels_in_the_name_of_the_tsar.html?id=yNhoAAAAMAAJ}}</ref>\nHowever, if the tsar's policies were too extreme or too disliked, he was not considered the true tsar. In these cases, it was necessary to replace this \u201cfake\u201d tsar with the \u201ctrue\u201d tsar, whoever he may be. Because the serfs had no political power, they rioted to get their message across. But usually, if the serfs did not like the policies of the tsar, they saw the nobles as corrupt and evil, preventing the people of Russia from communicating with the well-intentioned tsar and misinterpreting his decrees.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mamonova|first1=Natalia|title=Naive Monarchism and Rural Resistance In Contemporary Russia|journal=Rural Sociology|volume=81|issue=3|date=2016|pages=316\u201342|doi=10.1111/ruso.12097|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/297408651|accessdate=12 September 2017}}</ref> However, they were already suspicious of Catherine upon her accession, because she had annulled an act by Peter III that had essentially freed the serfs belonging to the Orthodox Church.<ref>Marc Raeff, \u201cPugachev\u2019s Rebellion,\u201d in ''Preconditions of Revolution in Early Europe'', The Johns Hopkins Press, 1972, 170</ref> Naturally, the serfs did not like it when Catherine tried to take away their right to petition her because they felt as though she had severed their connection to the autocrat, and their power to appeal to her. Far away from the capital, they were also confused as to the circumstances of her accession to the throne.<ref>{{harvnb|Madariaga|1981|pp=239\u201355}}</ref>\n\nThe peasants were discontented because of many other factors, as well, including crop failure, and epidemics, especially a major [[Plague Riot|epidemic in 1771]]. The nobles were also imposing a stricter rule than ever, reducing the land of each serf and restricting their freedoms further beginning around 1767.<ref>Raeff, \u201cPugachev\u2019s Rebellion\u201d, 166\u201369</ref> Their discontent led to widespread outbreaks of violence and rioting during [[Pugachev's Rebellion]] of 1774. The serfs probably followed someone who was pretending to be the true tsar because of their feelings of disconnection to Catherine and her policies empowering the nobles, but this was not the first time they followed a pretender under Catherine's reign.<ref>Raeff, \u201cPugachev\u2019s Rebellion\u201d, 171</ref> Pugachev had made stories about himself acting as a real tsar should, helping the common people, listening to their problems, praying for them, and generally acting saintly, and this helped rally the peasants and serfs, with their very conservative values, to his cause.<ref>Raeff, \u201cPugachev\u2019s Rebellion\u201d, 171\u201372</ref> With all this discontent in mind, Catherine did rule for 10 years before the anger of the serfs boiled over into a rebellion as extensive as Pugachev's. The rebellion ultimately failed and in fact backfired as Catherine was pushed even further away from the idea of serf liberation following the violent uprising. Under Catherine's rule, despite her enlightened ideals, the serfs were generally unhappy and discontented.\n\n== Final months and death ==\n[[File:Catherine II walking by V.Borovikovskiy (1794, Tretyakov gallery).jpg|thumb|upright|1794 portrait of Catherine, age approximately 65, with the [[Chesme Column]] in the background]]\n\nThough Catherine's life and reign included remarkable personal successes, they ended in two failures. Her Swedish cousin (once removed), King [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden|Gustav IV Adolph]], visited her in September 1796, the Empress's intention being that her granddaughter Alexandra should become Queen of Sweden by marriage. A ball was given at the imperial court on 11 September, when the engagement was supposed to be announced. Gustav Adolph felt pressured to accept that Alexandra would not convert to [[Lutheranism]], and though he was delighted by the young lady, he refused to appear at the ball and left for [[Stockholm]]. The frustration affected Catherine's health. She recovered well enough to begin to plan a ceremony which would establish her favourite grandson [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander]] as her heir, superseding her difficult son [[Paul I of Russia|Paul]], but she died before the announcement could be made, just over two months after the engagement ball.<ref name=\"Grande p. 427\">Henri Troyat in ''Catherine la Grande'' (Swedish translation by Harald Bohrn ''Katarina den stora : 1729\u2013796'' {{ISBN|978-91-1-952612-0}}) p. 427</ref>\n\nOn {{OldStyleDate|16 November|1796|5 November}}, Catherine rose early in the morning and had her usual morning coffee, soon settling down to work on papers; she told her lady's maid, [[Maria Perekusikhina]], that she had slept better than she had in a long time.<ref name=\"Rounding, p. 499\">{{harvnb|Rounding|2006|p=499}}</ref> Sometime after 9:00 she was found on the floor with her face purplish, her pulse weak, and her breathing shallow and laboured.<ref name=\"Rounding, p. 499\" /> The court physician diagnosed a stroke<ref name=\"Rounding, p. 499\" /><ref name=\"Dixon, p. 315\">{{harvnb|Dixon|2009|p=315}}</ref> and despite attempts to revive her she fell into a coma.

A popular insult to the Empress's legacy at the time is that she died after having sex with her horse. The story claimed that her maids believed that Catherine spent too much unsupervised time with her favorite horse, Dudley.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://allthatsinteresting.com/catherine-the-great | title=How Catherine the Great Shook up Europe's Male Power Structure| date=2 January 2017}}</ref> A German scholar [[Adam Olearius]] in his 1647 book ''Beschreibung der muscowitischen und persischen Reise'' claimed that Russians had fondness for sodomy, especially with horses.<ref>{{harvnb|Rounding|2006|p=508}}</ref> Olearius's claims about a supposed Russian tendency towards bestiality with horses was often repeated in anti-Russian literature throughout the 17th and 18th centuries to illustrate the alleged barbarous \"Asian\" nature of Russia.

Some authors believe that the enduring popularity of this supposed cause of death reflects strong misogynistic tendencies against female leaders that continues to this day.<ref>{{harvnb|Rounding|2006|p=508-509}}</ref>           \n\nCatherine's undated will, discovered in early 1792 by her secretary Alexander Vasilievich Khrapovitsky among her papers, gave specific instructions should she die: \"Lay out my corpse dressed in white, with a golden crown on my head, and on it inscribe my Christian name.

Pretenders plagued Catherine the Great's reign in a way unmatched by any other period in Russian history. At least seventeen of the twenty-six pretenders during Catherine's reign appeared in one of three clusters; six from 1764\u20131765, six from 1772\u20131774, and five from 1782\u20131786. Pretenders did not plague Catherine's reign because of her sex or nationality since pretenders never threatened other female rulers or rulers of foreign descent in the way that Catherine II was. The rise of pretenders was not related to war or famine as neither appeared consistently with the pretenders. If there tended to be any form of famine during a pretender's rise it was during their claim to power and not inspired by it. Catherine's illegitimate rise to power through the assassination of her husband, Peter III, did not inspire the pretenders since Elizabeth, who came to power in a similar fashion to Catherine, never had the same problem. Evidence suggests that pretenders plagued Catherine's reign for economic reasons. An important correlation between the three clusters is that the economic standing of serfs was declining. The condition of serfs worsened at the start of Catherine's reign because there was a sharp increase, 47%, in the number of peasants on state land and an establishment of a poll tax. The decline of pretenders illustrates the correlation between the conditions of serfs and the appearance of pretenders in the last third of Catherine's reign because she improved legal and economic conditions for the serfs to deter future pretenders. The serfs were not the only social group that suffered from worsening economic conditions. Leading into Catherine's reign both the odnodvortsy and Cossacks faced a harsh decline in their economic standing. The odnodvortsy were particularly upset about the decline in their economic standing because they were descendants of wealthy landowning servicemen. The odnodvortsy were angered even more in some regions of Russia as land lords expanded their property claiming odnodvortsy and peasants as serfs. The declining standing of the odnodvortsy and Cossacks created motivation to become pretenders especially during the 1760s. Even more importantly the odnodvortsy and Cossacks were vital support for pretenders because of their military experience.<ref>Philip Longworth, \u201cThe Pretender Phenomenon in Eighteenth-Century Russia,\u201d  ''Past & Present'' 66 (1975): 66\u201371.</ref>\n\nAt least sixteen pretenders during Catherine's reign claimed that they were the deposed tsar, Peter III. A less common position pretenders claimed during Catherine's reign was that of Ivan VI. Ivan VI was a potential threat to Catherine since he was exiled as an infant and could lay claim to the throne. Peter III was the more popular option for pretenders since there existed legends that he was not actually dead, allowing pretenders to convince discontented Russians they were Peter III. Peter III was also popular among Russians because of his benevolent rule. Pretenders claiming to be Peter III used his popularity among Russians to gain support. Pretenders had to be careful to establish themselves as the ruler they claimed to be without being recognised as a normal mortal and not of royal blood. One popular way to prevent recognition was to claim their right to royalty far from their home as both Emal'Ian Ivanovich Pugachev and the pretender Artem'ev did. Pretenders also had to account for where they had disappeared to for the time since their reported deaths. For example, Pugachev claimed that he spent the eleven years since Peter III's reported death wandering abroad as far as [[Egypt]] or [[Constantinople]].<ref>Philip Longworth, \u201cThe Pretender Phenomenon in Eighteenth-Century Russia,\u201d ''Past & Present'' 66 (1975): 70\u201377.</ref>\n\n==== Pretenders and royal marks ====\n[[File:Imperial Monogram of Empress Catherine II of Russia.svg|thumb|upright|Imperial monogram]]\n\nMany Russians believed that tsars and tsarevichs bore special marks on their bodies symbolising their royal status, which became known as royal marks. Four of the pretenders claiming to be Peter III showed royal marks to legitimise their claims. The first fake Peter to have royal marks was Gavrila Kremnev who Lev Evdokimov recognised because of a cross on Kremnev's foot. Lev Evdokimov claimed that he had worked as a chorister at the royal palace and had held the real Peter III in his arms as a child therefore giving credibility to Kremnev's claims. Despite Kremnev's marking, he never gained many supporters and was flogged and branded with the words, \u201cdeserter and pretender\u201d. The next fake Peter III to show a royal mark of some sort was Fedot Kazin-Bogomolov in 1772. He showed a prison guard a cross on his chest and claimed he had two more on his arm and head, allowing him to gain many supporters. The government branded Kazin-Bogomolov despite his markings. The third Peter III with royal marks was the most famous of the four and the most successful pretender of the time, Pugachev. In 1773 Pugachev staged a revealing of his royal identity to a Cossack, Eremina Kuritsa, leading other Cossacks to challenge Pugachev at dinner, which resulted in him showing scars on his chest and head to the Cossacks. Pugachev claimed the scars on his chest were caused from the coup against him and that the scars on his forehead were from smallpox. Pugachev's rational reasoning for his markings caused him to continually gain supporters throughout his stand as a pretender. Unlike the first two pretenders to show royal marks, Pugachev's efforts cost him his life since his punishment was execution. The final pretender during Catherine's reign to reveal royal marks was Makar Mosiakin in 1774. Mosiakin entered a peasant hut claiming to be Peter III and then showed the peasants crosses on his arms, claiming they represented royal inheritance. According to the official report of the Mosiakin he had made the cross marks himself to convince people that he was Peter III, and he actually had some success as he managed to gain followers from various villages, going from house to house.<ref>Maureen Perrie, \u201cRoyal Marks\u201d, ''Kritika: Explorations in Russian and Eurasian History'' 11 (2010): 535, 546\u201349.</ref>\n\n=== Succession to the throne ===\n[[File:\u041c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u043d\u044f\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0438 \u0415\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0442\u044b \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0435\u0432\u043d\u044b.jpg|thumb|Catherine, [[Elizabeth Alexeievna (Louise of Baden)|Louise of Baden]], Catherine's son Paul and grandson [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander]], 1795]]\nOn a date already set for a week before she died, Catherine had intended to formally announce<ref name=\"Grande p. 427\" /> that Paul would be excluded from the succession, and that the crown would go to her eldest grandson, Alexander (whom she greatly favoured, and who subsequently became the emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] in 1801).

In February 2017, the album was certified Platinum, after earning 1 million album-equivalent units (sales, streaming and track sales).\n\nOn November 25, 2016, Martinez released an EP titled [[Cry Baby (Melanie Martinez album)#Cry Baby's Extra Clutter|''Cry Baby's Extra Clutter'']]. The EP, released exclusively on vinyl, consisted of the three bonus tracks from ''Cry Baby'', and \"Gingerbread Man\", which was released for Christmas of 2015. The album was promoted by the Cry Baby Tour (2015\u20132017).\n\n==Background and production==\n{{expand section | additional citations|date=March 2017}}\nMartinez began recording for her debut album soon after she was eliminated from ''[[The Voice (American TV series)|The Voice]]''. She had an acoustic album completely done around 2013 and was ready to put it out, although she decided against it. Later, she finished her song \"Dollhouse\" and changed her whole sound after discovering how much she liked this new sound. She discarded the tracks from the finished album and began working on new music. In May 2014, Melanie put out her ''[[Dollhouse (Melanie Martinez EP)|Dollhouse EP]]'', and announced that summer that she hoped to have her album out around October. When October came, Melanie released the video for \"Carousel\" and postponed her release date for her album, and stated that she hoped to have it out in spring. That spring, Kinetics & One Love announced that all of the vocals for Melanie's album were finished, and Melanie officially announced that her album would be titled \"Cry Baby\". Melanie began teasing some titles for tracks. The first single was \"Pity Party\" and was confirmed on May 27, 2015. The music video was accidentally leaked by Melanie herself on May 29, but she later tweeted that she was happy and excited for the fans who had seen it and promised there was \"more to come\" during her livestream on June 1. It was officially released on the day of the livestream. During the livestream, Martinez announced that the release day of ''Cry Baby'' would be in August. The second single, \"Soap\", was confirmed in late June and it was announced soon before it was to be released on July 10. It leaked a day earlier. The one-shot music video came out the same day.\n\nOn July 16, the album art and release date were leaked on Amazon, although the release date was false. On July 17, the album art was officially revealed and merchandise bundles were available to pre-order on Martinez's website, with the digital pre-order on July 24. Before the 24th, the track list of the album was leaked, although the websites that leaked it replaced \"Tag, You're It\" with \"Jump Rope\" and \"Play Date\" with \"Half Hearted\". The track list was officially revealed on the 24th with the pre-order. Starting on July 27, Melanie released a snippet of each song (apart from the ones on the deluxe edition) on her [[Instagram]] page. On July 28, Melanie released the snippet for \"Sippy Cup\" and announced that it would be released on July 31. On July 30, [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] premiered the video and \"Sippy Cup\" was released the day after. The album was released on August 14. The CD was packaged as a storybook, with jewel case CDs available later. Both a picture disk and a standard black vinyl were released in the future. Cassettes were then released, advertised as being in yellow, blue, and pink. There is also a less common green cassette. All physical copies of the album are the standard explicit, with the deluxe and clean being digital exclusives.\n\n===Concept===\nThe album is about a character, named Cry Baby, a fantasy version of Martinez when she was a child, and a representation of her vulnerable and messed up side. Martinez described Cry Baby as \"a child who experiences adult things\". She claims that many of the things that have happened to Cry Baby are similar to the things that have happened in her own life, except the part where Cry Baby gets kidnapped and kills her kidnapper. Each song on the tracklist has a childhood-related title and contains childhood-related metaphors while the deeper messages being crossed to the listener carry more adult themes and problems. For example, the song \"Cry Baby\" refers to someone who is teased for openly displaying their emotions (as opposed to an actual baby), and the song \"Training Wheels\" is actually about taking a relationship to the next level. The story book available in the pre-order bundle features rhymes and illustrations based on the album, written by Martinez herself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://melaniemartinezmusic.com/crybaby/|title=Cry Baby by Melanie Martinez|accessdate=2 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150728004617/http://melaniemartinezmusic.com/crybaby/|archive-date=28 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe album was released on August 14, 2015, by [[Atlantic Records]], through [[Music download|digital download]], [[CD]], [[gramophone records|vinyl]] and audio cassette.<ref name=\"store\" /> The vinyl and CD have special packaging which includes a story book which follows the album by illustrator Chloe Tersigni.<ref name=\"popdust\" /> ''Cry Baby'' debuted at number 6 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 41,000 units sold in its first week; it also debuted at the top of the Alternative Albums Chart.

It was released on August 14, 2015, by [[Atlantic Records]] through [[Music download|digital download]], [[CD]], vinyl and audio cassette.<ref name=\"noiseyvice\" /><ref name=\"store\" /> The album was supported by the release of three [[Single (music)|singles]]. Two singles preceded the album's release: [[lead single]] \"[[Pity Party (song)|Pity Party]]\", was released on June 2, 2015,<ref name=\"iTunes\" /> while the second single, \"[[Soap (Melanie Martinez song)|Soap]]\", was released on July 10, 2015. The third and final single from the album, \"[[Sippy Cup (song)|Sippy Cup]]\" was released July 31, 2015. ''Cry Baby'' is a [[Music video|visual]] [[concept album]]. The album is labeled as an [[alternative pop]],<ref name=\"popdustreview\" />  [[electropop]],<ref name=\"abcreview\" /> and [[indie pop]]<ref name=\"underthegunreview\" /> release, and received generally positive reviews<!-- don't change to \"acclaim\", is not even on Metacritic--> from critics. In February 2017, the album was certified Platinum, after earning 1 million album-equivalent units (sales, streaming and track sales).\n\nOn November 25, 2016, Martinez released an EP titled [[Cry Baby (Melanie Martinez album)#Cry Baby's Extra Clutter|''Cry Baby's Extra Clutter'']]. The EP, released exclusively on vinyl, consisted of the three bonus tracks from ''Cry Baby'', and \"Gingerbread Man\", which was released for Christmas of 2015. The album was promoted by the Cry Baby Tour (2015\u20132017).\n\n==Background and production==\n{{expand section | additional citations|date=March 2017}}\nMartinez began recording for her debut album soon after she was eliminated from ''[[The Voice (American TV series)|The Voice]]''. She had an acoustic album completely done around 2013 and was ready to put it out, although she decided against it. Later, she finished her song \"Dollhouse\" and changed her whole sound after discovering how much she liked this new sound. She discarded the tracks from the finished album and began working on new music. In May 2014, Melanie put out her ''[[Dollhouse (Melanie Martinez EP)|Dollhouse EP]]'', and announced that summer that she hoped to have her album out around October. When October came, Melanie released the video for \"Carousel\" and postponed her release date for her album, and stated that she hoped to have it out in spring. That spring, Kinetics & One Love announced that all of the vocals for Melanie's album were finished, and Melanie officially announced that her album would be titled \"Cry Baby\". Melanie began teasing some titles for tracks. The first single was \"Pity Party\" and was confirmed on May 27, 2015. The music video was accidentally leaked by Melanie herself on May 29, but she later tweeted that she was happy and excited for the fans who had seen it and promised there was \"more to come\" during her livestream on June 1. It was officially released on the day of the livestream. During the livestream, Martinez announced that the release day of ''Cry Baby'' would be in August. The second single, \"Soap\", was confirmed in late June and it was announced soon before it was to be released on July 10. It leaked a day earlier. The one-shot music video came out the same day.\n\nOn July 16, the album art and release date were leaked on Amazon, although the release date was false. On July 17, the album art was officially revealed and merchandise bundles were available to pre-order on Martinez's website, with the digital pre-order on July 24. Before the 24th, the track list of the album was leaked, although the websites that leaked it replaced \"Tag, You're It\" with \"Jump Rope\" and \"Play Date\" with \"Half Hearted\". The track list was officially revealed on the 24th with the pre-order. Starting on July 27, Melanie released a snippet of each song (apart from the ones on the deluxe edition) on her [[Instagram]] page. On July 28, Melanie released the snippet for \"Sippy Cup\" and announced that it would be released on July 31. On July 30, [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] premiered the video and \"Sippy Cup\" was released the day after. The album was released on August 14. The CD was packaged as a storybook, with jewel case CDs available later. Both a picture disk and a standard black vinyl were released in the future. Cassettes were then released, advertised as being in yellow, blue, and pink. There is also a less common green cassette. All physical copies of the album are the standard explicit, with the deluxe and clean being digital exclusives.\n\n===Concept===\nThe album is about a character, named Cry Baby, a fantasy version of Martinez when she was a child, and a representation of her vulnerable and messed up side. Martinez described Cry Baby as \"a child who experiences adult things\". She claims that many of the things that have happened to Cry Baby are similar to the things that have happened in her own life, except the part where Cry Baby gets kidnapped and kills her kidnapper. Each song on the tracklist has a childhood-related title and contains childhood-related metaphors while the deeper messages being crossed to the listener carry more adult themes and problems. For example, the song \"Cry Baby\" refers to someone who is teased for openly displaying their emotions (as opposed to an actual baby), and the song \"Training Wheels\" is actually about taking a relationship to the next level. The story book available in the pre-order bundle features rhymes and illustrations based on the album, written by Martinez herself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://melaniemartinezmusic.com/crybaby/|title=Cry Baby by Melanie Martinez|accessdate=2 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150728004617/http://melaniemartinezmusic.com/crybaby/|archive-date=28 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe album was released on August 14, 2015, by [[Atlantic Records]], through [[Music download|digital download]], [[CD]], [[gramophone records|vinyl]] and audio cassette.<ref name=\"store\" /> The vinyl and CD have special packaging which includes a story book which follows the album by illustrator Chloe Tersigni.<ref name=\"popdust\" /> ''Cry Baby'' debuted at number 6 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 41,000 units sold in its first week; it also debuted at the top of the Alternative Albums Chart.
