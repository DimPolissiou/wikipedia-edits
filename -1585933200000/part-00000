The [[Riddles|riddle]] was a major, prestigious literary genre in Anglo-Saxon England, and riddles were written both in Latin and Old English verse. The most famous Anglo-Saxon riddles are in Old English and found in the tenth-century [[Exeter Book]], while the pre-eminent Anglo-Saxon composer of Latin riddles was the seventh- to eighth-century scholar [[Aldhelm]].\n\nSurviving riddles range from theological and scholarly to comical and obscene and attempt to provide new perspectives and viewpoints in describing the world. Some at least were probably meant to be performed rather than merely read to oneself and give us a glimpse into the life and culture of the era.<ref name=\"Broadview\"/>\n\nThe Old English riddles have been much more studied than the Latin ones, but recent work has argued that the two groups need to be understood together as 'a vigorous, common tradition of Old English and Anglo-Latin enigmatography'.<ref>Dieter Bitterli, ''Say what I am Called: The Old English Riddles of the Exeter Book and the Anglo-Latin Riddle Tradition'', Toronto Anglo-Saxon Series, 2 (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2009).</ref> Much past work on the Old English riddles has focused on finding and debating solutions,<ref>E.g. Patrick J. Murphy, ''Unriddling the Exteter Riddles'' (University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2011), p. 16, citing Glorie and Sorrell.</ref> but a new wave of work has started using riddles as a way to study Anglo-Saxon [[world-view]]s through the critical approaches of [[eco-criticism]].<ref>E.g. Helen Price, 'Human and NonHuman in Anglo-Saxon and British Postwar Poetry: Reshaping Literary Ecology' (unpublished PhD thesis, University of Leeds, 2013), http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/6607/.</ref>\n\n==Anglo-Latin ''enigmata''==\n\nThe earliest attested riddles in Anglo-Saxon England are in Latin, where they are known as ''enigmata'' ('enigmas') and formed a thriving literary genre which is likely to have inspired the later collection of vernacular riddles in the Exeter Book.<ref>Andy Orchard, \"Enigma Variations: The Anglo-Saxon Riddle-Tradition,\" in ''Latin Learning and English Lore: Studies in Anglo-Saxon Literature for Michael Lapidge'', ed. by Andy Orchard and Katherine O\u2019Brien O\u2019Keeffe, 2 vols (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2005), I 284-304.</ref> Unlike the Exeter Book riddles, the Anglo-Saxon ''enigmata'' are presented in manuscripts with their solutions as their title, and seldom close with a challenge to the reader to guess their solution.<ref name=\"Andy Orchard 2013\">Andy Orchard, 'Enigmata', in ''The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England'', ed. by Michael Lapidge, John Blair, Simon Keynes, and Donald Scragg, 2nd edn (Chichester: Wiley Blackwell, 2013), s.v.</ref>\n\n===Aldhelm===\n\nApparently inspired by the hundred ''Aenigmata'' of [[Symphosius]], another, possibly north-Italian collection of metrical Latin riddles known today as the [[Bern Riddles]], along with Byzantine literary riddling, the Anglo-Saxon aristocrat, scholar, abbot and bishop [[Aldhelm]] composed his own collection of a hundred (hexa)metrical ''enigmata''.<ref>Milovanovi\u0107-Barham, \u010celica, 'Aldhelm's ''Enigmata'' and Byzantine Riddles', ''Anglo-Saxon England'', 22 (1993), 51-64, {{DOI|10.1017/S0263675100004300}}.</ref> He included it in his ''Epistola ad Acircium'', a study of poetry dedicated to one Acircius, understood to be King [[Aldfrith of Northumbria]], and therefore presumably written during his reign (685-704/5); Aldhelm records that his riddles were composed early in his career 'as scholarly illustrations of the principles of Latin versification', and may have been the work where he established his poetic skill in Latin.<ref name=\"Andy Orchard 2013\"/> The letter consists of three treatises:\n*''De septenario'', treatise on the number seven in [[arithmology]].\n*''De metris'', treatise on metre, including the ''Enigmata''.\n*''De pedum regulis'', didactive treatise on [[metrical feet]], such as iambs and spondees.\nMany were directly inspired by Symphosius's, but overall, Aldhelm's collection is quite different in tone and purpose: as well as being an exposition of Latin poetic metres, diction, and techniques, it seems to be intended as an exploration of the wonders of God's creation.<ref>Whitman, F. H.  \u2018Medieval Riddling: Factors Underlying Its Development\u2019, ''Neuphilologische Mitteilungen'', 71 (1970), 177\u201385.</ref> The riddles generally become more metrically and linguistically complex as the collection proceeds. The first eight riddles deal with cosmology. Riddles 9-82 are more heterogeneous, covering a wide variety of animals, plants, artefacts, materials and phenomena, but can be seen to establish purposeful contrasts (for example between the light of a candle in Enigma 52 and that of the Great Bear in 53) or sequences (for example the animals of Enigmata 34-39: locust, screech-owl, midge, crab, pond-skater, lion). Riddles 81-99 seem all to concern monsters and wonders. Finally, the long hundredth riddle is \"Creatura\", the whole of Creation.<ref>Mercedes Salvador-Bello, 'Patterns of Compilation in Anglo-Latin ''Enigmata'' and the Evidence of A Source-Collection in Riddles 1-40 of the ''Exeter Book'', ''Viator'', 43 (2012), 339\u2013374 (pp. 341-46). 10.1484/J.VIATOR.1.102554.</ref> His most prominent themes were 'the natural world, daily life, church furniture, and the classroom. A bookish quality is evident in many of the other topics addressed, which would certainly have been outside the daily experience of Anglo-Saxon England'.<ref name=\"Andy Orchard 2013\"/> Aldhelm may have known the passage through his teacher [[Adrian of Canterbury|Hadrian]].<ref>Andy Orchard, ''The Poetic Art of Aldhelm'', Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1994 does not mention the ''[[Corpus Hermeticum]]''.</ref>\n\nPerhaps because of its use in Anglo-Saxon education, Aldhelm's collection inspired several more Anglo-Latin riddle collections: not long after Aldhelm composed his ''enigmata'', [[Saint Boniface]] composed his own, in the form of 'a series of ten poems on the Vices and ten on the Virtues produced for the moral instruction of an unnamed female correspondent', influenced greatly by [[Aldhelm]] and containing many references to works of [[Vergil]] (the ''[[Aeneid]]'', the ''[[Georgics]]'', and the ''[[Eclogues]]'').<ref name=\"Andy Orchard 2013\"/>\n\n====Example ''enigma''====\n\nAn example of an ''enigma'' by Aldhelm is his ''Elleborus'', by which word Aldhelm understood not the [[hellebore]], but [[woody nightshade]].<ref>Cameron, M.

There is speculation that there may once have been, or have been intended to be, 100 riddles in the book, since this would match the Latin collections discussed above. The riddles are all written in [[alliterative verse]], and frequently end with an injunction to 'say what I am called', suggesting that they were indeed recited as verbal entertainment; yet they clearly have diverse origins.<ref name=\"Broadview\">Black, Joseph, et al., eds.

''Riddling the voices of others: The Old English Exeter Book riddles and a pedagogy of the anonymous''. Diss. Illinois State University, 2007.</ref> The Exeter Book riddles can be situated within a wider tradition of 'speaking objects' in Anglo-Saxon culture and have much in common with poems such as ''The Dream of the Rood'' and ''The Husband's Message'' and with artefacts such as the Alfred Jewel or the Brussels Cross, which endow inanimate things with first-person voices.<ref>James Paz, ''Nonhuman Voices in Anglo-Saxon Literature and Material Culture'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2017), pp. 17-26; http://www.oapen.org/search?identifier=631090.</ref>\n\nThe Exeter Book riddles are varied in theme, but they are all used to engage and challenge the readers mentally. By representing the familiar, material world from an oblique angle, many not only draw on but also complicate or challenge social norms such as martial masculinity, patriarchal attitudes to women, lords' dominance over their servants, and humans' over animals.<ref>Helen Price, 'Human and NonHuman in Anglo-Saxon and British Postwar Poetry: Reshaping Literary Ecology' (unpublished doctoral thesis, University of Leeds, 2014), esp. ch. 2; http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/6607/; https://www.academia.edu/6827866.</ref> Thirteen, for example, have as their solution an implement, which speaks of itself through the riddle as a servant to its lord; but these sometimes also suggest the power of the servant to define the master.<ref>Jennifer Neville, 'The Unexpected Treasure of the \"Implement Trope\": Hierarchical Relationships in the Old English Riddles', ''Review of English Studies'', 62 [256] (2011), 505-519. doi: 10.1093/res/hgq131.</ref> Unlike the Latin Anglo-Saxon riddles, the Old English ones tend not to rely on intellectual obscurity to make the riddle more difficult for the reader,<ref name=\"Broadview\"/> rather focusing on describing processes of manufacture and transformation. The reader must be observant to any double meanings or \"hinge words\" in order to discover the answer to the riddle.<ref name=\"Lind\"/><ref>John D. Niles, '' Old English Enigmatic Poems and the Play of the Texts'', Studies in the early Middle Ages, 13 (Turnhout: Brepols, 2006).</ref> The search for answers to the riddles has been addressed at length by Patrick J. Murphy, focusing on thought patterns of the period, but there is still no unanimous agreement on some of them.<ref>Patrick J. Murphy. 2011. ''Unriddling the Exeter Riddles''.  University Park: Penn State University Press.</ref> Some of the riddles are translated from Latin, such as the [[Leiden Riddle]] (which is preserved both outside and within the Exeter Book); others seem to have come directly from vernacular tradition.\n\nThe Anglo Saxon riddles are notable for their use of compound nouns and adjectives. These word combinations became what could be considered riddles within the riddle itself. They offered a new perspective and would poetically personify their subject.<ref name=Rios>Rios, Alberto. [http://www.public.asu.edu/~aarios/formsofverse/furtherreading/page3.html Anglo-Saxon Prosody, \"Forms of Verse\".] Fall, 2000.</ref>\n\nThe majority of the riddles have religious themes and answers. Some of the religious contexts within the riddles are \"manuscript book (or Bible),\" \"soul and body,\" \"fish and river\" (fish are often used to symbolize Christ).<ref name=\"Broadview\"/> The riddles also were written about common objects, and even animals were used as inspiration for some of the riddles. One example of a typical, religious riddle is Riddle 41, which describes the soul and body:\n\n:A noble guest of great lineage dwells\n:In the house of man.  Grim hunger\n:Cannot harm him, nor feverish thirst,\n:Nor age, nor illness.  If the servant\n:Of the guest who rules, serves well\n:On the journey, they will find together\n:Bliss and well-being, a feast of fate;\n:If the slave will not as a brother be ruled\n:By a lord he should fear and follow\n:Then both will suffer and sire a family\n:Of sorrows when, springing from the world,\n:They leave the bright bosom of one kinswoman,\n:Mother and sister, who nourished them.\n:Let the man who knows noble words\n:Say what the guest and servant are called.<ref name=\"Broadview\"/>\n\n:<sup>Trans. by Craig Williamson, ''A Feast of Creatures: Anglo-Saxon Riddle-Songs'' (1982)</sup>\n\nWhile the Exeter Book was found in a cathedral library, and while it is clear that religious scribes worked on the riddles, not all of the riddles in the book are religiously themed.  Many of the answers to the riddles are everyday, common objects. There are also many double entendres, which can lead to an answer that is obscene. One example of this is Riddle 23:\n\n:I am wonderful help to women,\n:The hope of something to come. I harm\n:No citizen except my slayer.\n:Rooted I stand on a high bed.\n:I am shaggy below. Sometimes the beautiful\n:Peasant's daughter, an eager-armed,\n:Proud woman grabs my body,\n:Rushes my red skin, holds me hard,\n:Claims my head.

If the reader pays close attention to the wording in the latter half of the riddle, however, he or she may be led to believe that the answer is a man's penis. Both of these answers are perfectly legitimate answers to this riddle, but one is very innocent where the other is very obscene.  Even though some of the riddles contained obscene meanings, that is not to say that the majority of riddles in the Exeter Book were obscene. There were more religious and animalistic riddles than obscene riddles.\n\nSince the riddles were crammed into the pages of the manuscript with hardly any organization, many of the riddles vary in structure.  The boundaries between riddles were often unclear and translations are relatively rough.<ref name=Rios/> The object of the riddles is generally preserved despite these possible errors.  Notably, not a single one of the riddles found in the Exeter book were accompanied with answers.  In fact, some remain unanswered to this day, such as Riddle 91:\n\n:I am noble, known to rest in the quiet\n:Keeping of many men, humble and high born.\n:The plunderers\u2019 joy, hauled far from friends,\n:Rides richly on me, shines signifying power,\n:Whether I proclaim the grandeur of halls,\n:The wealth of cities, or the glory of God.\n:Now wise men love most my strange way\n:Of offering wisdom to many without voice.\n:Though the children of earth eagerly seek\n:To trace my trail, sometimes my tracks are dim.<ref name=\"Broadview\"/>\n\n:<sup>Trans. by Craig Williamson, ''A Feast of Creatures: Anglo-Saxon Riddle-Songs'' (1982)</sup>\n\n===Types of riddles in the Exeter Book===\nAccording to [[Archer Taylor]],<ref name=\"Lind\"/> most riddles from the Exeter Book are 'true riddles' and can be placed into five categories: \n* the true riddle \n* the [[neck-riddle]]\n* the arithmetical puzzle \n* the clever question\n* the [[wikt:conundrum|conundrum]] ([[joke riddle]])\n\n[[Nigel F.

The [[Riddles|riddle]] was a major, prestigious literary genre in Anglo-Saxon England, and riddles were written both in Latin and Old English verse. The most famous Anglo-Saxon riddles are in Old English and found in the tenth-century [[Exeter Book]], while the pre-eminent Anglo-Saxon composer of Latin riddles was the seventh- to eighth-century scholar [[Aldhelm]].\n\nSurviving riddles range from theological and scholarly to comical and obscene and attempt to provide new perspectives and viewpoints in describing the world. Some at least were probably meant to be performed rather than merely read to oneself and give us a glimpse into the life and culture of the era.<ref name=\"Broadview\"/>\n\nThe Old English riddles have been much more studied than the Latin ones, but recent work has argued that the two groups need to be understood together as 'a vigorous, common tradition of Old English and Anglo-Latin enigmatography'.<ref>Dieter Bitterli, ''Say what I am Called: The Old English Riddles of the Exeter Book and the Anglo-Latin Riddle Tradition'', Toronto Anglo-Saxon Series, 2 (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2009).</ref> Much past work on the Old English riddles has focused on finding and debating solutions,<ref>E.g. Patrick J. Murphy, ''Unriddling the Exteter Riddles'' (University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2011), p. 16, citing Glorie and Sorrell.</ref> but a new wave of work has started using riddles as a way to study Anglo-Saxon [[world-view]]s through the critical approaches of [[eco-criticism]].<ref>E.g. Helen Price, 'Human and NonHuman in Anglo-Saxon and British Postwar Poetry: Reshaping Literary Ecology' (unpublished PhD thesis, University of Leeds, 2013), http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/6607/.</ref>\n\n==Anglo-Latin ''enigmata''==\n\nThe earliest attested riddles in Anglo-Saxon England are in Latin, where they are known as ''enigmata'' ('enigmas') and formed a thriving literary genre which is likely to have inspired the later collection of vernacular riddles in the Exeter Book.<ref>Andy Orchard, \"Enigma Variations: The Anglo-Saxon Riddle-Tradition,\" in ''Latin Learning and English Lore: Studies in Anglo-Saxon Literature for Michael Lapidge'', ed. by Andy Orchard and Katherine O\u2019Brien O\u2019Keeffe, 2 vols (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2005), I 284-304.</ref> Unlike the Exeter Book riddles, the Anglo-Saxon ''enigmata'' are presented in manuscripts with their solutions as their title, and seldom close with a challenge to the reader to guess their solution.<ref name=\"Andy Orchard 2013\">Andy Orchard, 'Enigmata', in ''The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England'', ed. by Michael Lapidge, John Blair, Simon Keynes, and Donald Scragg, 2nd edn (Chichester: Wiley Blackwell, 2013), s.v.</ref>\n\n===Aldhelm===\n\nApparently inspired by the hundred ''Aenigmata'' of [[Symphosius]], another, possibly north-Italian collection of metrical Latin riddles known today as the [[Bern Riddles]], along with Byzantine literary riddling, the Anglo-Saxon aristocrat, scholar, abbot and bishop [[Aldhelm]] composed his own collection of a hundred (hexa)metrical ''enigmata''.<ref>Milovanovi\u0107-Barham, \u010celica, 'Aldhelm's ''Enigmata'' and Byzantine Riddles', ''Anglo-Saxon England'', 22 (1993), 51-64, {{DOI|10.1017/S0263675100004300}}.</ref> He included it in his ''Epistola ad Acircium'', a study of poetry dedicated to one Acircius, understood to be King [[Aldfrith of Northumbria]], and therefore presumably written during his reign (685-704/5); Aldhelm records that his riddles were composed early in his career 'as scholarly illustrations of the principles of Latin versification', and may have been the work where he established his poetic skill in Latin.<ref name=\"Andy Orchard 2013\"/> The letter consists of three treatises:\n*''De septenario'', treatise on the number seven in [[arithmology]].\n*''De metris'', treatise on metre, including the ''Enigmata''.\n*''De pedum regulis'', didactive treatise on [[metrical feet]], such as iambs and spondees.\nMany were directly inspired by Symphosius's, but overall, Aldhelm's collection is quite different in tone and purpose: as well as being an exposition of Latin poetic metres, diction, and techniques, it seems to be intended as an exploration of the wonders of God's creation.<ref>Whitman, F. H.  \u2018Medieval Riddling: Factors Underlying Its Development\u2019, ''Neuphilologische Mitteilungen'', 71 (1970), 177\u201385.</ref> The riddles generally become more metrically and linguistically complex as the collection proceeds. The first eight riddles deal with cosmology. Riddles 9-82 are more heterogeneous, covering a wide variety of animals, plants, artefacts, materials and phenomena, but can be seen to establish purposeful contrasts (for example between the light of a candle in Enigma 52 and that of the Great Bear in 53) or sequences (for example the animals of Enigmata 34-39: locust, screech-owl, midge, crab, pond-skater, lion). Riddles 81-99 seem all to concern monsters and wonders. Finally, the long hundredth riddle is \"Creatura\", the whole of Creation.<ref>Mercedes Salvador-Bello, 'Patterns of Compilation in Anglo-Latin ''Enigmata'' and the Evidence of A Source-Collection in Riddles 1-40 of the ''Exeter Book'', ''Viator'', 43 (2012), 339\u2013374 (pp. 341-46). 10.1484/J.VIATOR.1.102554.</ref> His most prominent themes were 'the natural world, daily life, church furniture, and the classroom. A bookish quality is evident in many of the other topics addressed, which would certainly have been outside the daily experience of Anglo-Saxon England'.<ref name=\"Andy Orchard 2013\"/> Aldhelm may have known the passage through his teacher [[Adrian of Canterbury|Hadrian]].<ref>Andy Orchard, ''The Poetic Art of Aldhelm'', Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1994 does not mention the ''[[Corpus Hermeticum]]''.</ref>\n\nPerhaps because of its use in Anglo-Saxon education, Aldhelm's collection inspired several more Anglo-Latin riddle collections: not long after Aldhelm composed his ''enigmata'', [[Saint Boniface]] composed his own, in the form of 'a series of ten poems on the Vices and ten on the Virtues produced for the moral instruction of an unnamed female correspondent', influenced greatly by [[Aldhelm]] and containing many references to works of [[Vergil]] (the ''[[Aeneid]]'', the ''[[Georgics]]'', and the ''[[Eclogues]]'').<ref name=\"Andy Orchard 2013\"/>\n\n====Example ''enigma''====\n\nAn example of an ''enigma'' by Aldhelm is his ''Elleborus'', by which word Aldhelm understood not the [[hellebore]], but [[woody nightshade]].<ref>Cameron, M.

There is speculation that there may once have been, or have been intended to be, 100 riddles in the book, since this would match the Latin collections discussed above. The riddles are all written in [[alliterative verse]], and frequently end with an injunction to 'say what I am called', suggesting that they were indeed recited as verbal entertainment; yet they clearly have diverse origins.<ref name=\"Broadview\">Black, Joseph, et al., eds. ''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: Volume 1: The Medieval Period''. 2nd ed. Ontario, Canada: Broadview Press,2009. Print.</ref><ref name=\"Lind\">Lind, Carol. ''Riddling the voices of others: The Old English Exeter Book riddles and a pedagogy of the anonymous''. Diss. Illinois State University, 2007.</ref> The Exeter Book riddles can be situated within a wider tradition of 'speaking objects' in Anglo-Saxon culture and have much in common with poems such as ''The Dream of the Rood'' and ''The Husband's Message'' and with artefacts such as the Alfred Jewel or the Brussels Cross, which endow inanimate things with first-person voices.<ref>James Paz, ''Nonhuman Voices in Anglo-Saxon Literature and Material Culture'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2017), pp. 17-26; http://www.oapen.org/search?identifier=631090.</ref>\n\nThe Exeter Book riddles are varied in theme, but they are all used to engage and challenge the readers mentally. By representing the familiar, material world from an oblique angle, many not only draw on but also complicate or challenge social norms such as martial masculinity, patriarchal attitudes to women, lords' dominance over their servants, and humans' over animals.<ref>Helen Price, 'Human and NonHuman in Anglo-Saxon and British Postwar Poetry: Reshaping Literary Ecology' (unpublished doctoral thesis, University of Leeds, 2014), esp. ch. 2; http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/6607/; https://www.academia.edu/6827866.</ref> Thirteen, for example, have as their solution an implement, which speaks of itself through the riddle as a servant to its lord; but these sometimes also suggest the power of the servant to define the master.<ref>Jennifer Neville, 'The Unexpected Treasure of the \"Implement Trope\": Hierarchical Relationships in the Old English Riddles', ''Review of English Studies'', 62 [256] (2011), 505-519. doi: 10.1093/res/hgq131.</ref> Unlike the Latin Anglo-Saxon riddles, the Old English ones tend not to rely on intellectual obscurity to make the riddle more difficult for the reader,<ref name=\"Broadview\"/> rather focusing on describing processes of manufacture and transformation. The reader must be observant to any double meanings or \"hinge words\" in order to discover the answer to the riddle.<ref name=\"Lind\"/><ref>John D. Niles, '' Old English Enigmatic Poems and the Play of the Texts'', Studies in the early Middle Ages, 13 (Turnhout: Brepols, 2006).</ref> The search for answers to the riddles has been addressed at length by Patrick J. Murphy, focusing on thought patterns of the period, but there is still no unanimous agreement on some of them.<ref>Patrick J. Murphy. 2011. ''Unriddling the Exeter Riddles''.  University Park: Penn State University Press.</ref> Some of the riddles are translated from Latin, such as the [[Leiden Riddle]] (which is preserved both outside and within the Exeter Book); others seem to have come directly from vernacular tradition.\n\nThe Anglo Saxon riddles are notable for their use of compound nouns and adjectives. These word combinations became what could be considered riddles within the riddle itself. They offered a new perspective and would poetically personify their subject.<ref name=Rios>Rios, Alberto. [http://www.public.asu.edu/~aarios/formsofverse/furtherreading/page3.html Anglo-Saxon Prosody, \"Forms of Verse\".] Fall, 2000.</ref>\n\nThe majority of the riddles have religious themes and answers. Some of the religious contexts within the riddles are \"manuscript book (or Bible),\" \"soul and body,\" \"fish and river\" (fish are often used to symbolize Christ).<ref name=\"Broadview\"/> The riddles also were written about common objects, and even animals were used as inspiration for some of the riddles. One example of a typical, religious riddle is Riddle 41, which describes the soul and body:\n\n:A noble guest of great lineage dwells\n:In the house of man.  Grim hunger\n:Cannot harm him, nor feverish thirst,\n:Nor age, nor illness.  If the servant\n:Of the guest who rules, serves well\n:On the journey, they will find together\n:Bliss and well-being, a feast of fate;\n:If the slave will not as a brother be ruled\n:By a lord he should fear and follow\n:Then both will suffer and sire a family\n:Of sorrows when, springing from the world,\n:They leave the bright bosom of one kinswoman,\n:Mother and sister, who nourished them.\n:Let the man who knows noble words\n:Say what the guest and servant are called.<ref name=\"Broadview\"/>\n\n:<sup>Trans. by Craig Williamson, ''A Feast of Creatures: Anglo-Saxon Riddle-Songs'' (1982)</sup>\n\nWhile the Exeter Book was found in a cathedral library, and while it is clear that religious scribes worked on the riddles, not all of the riddles in the book are religiously themed.  Many of the answers to the riddles are everyday, common objects. There are also many double entendres, which can lead to an answer that is obscene. One example of this is Riddle 23:\n\n:I am wonderful help to women,\n:The hope of something to come. I harm\n:No citizen except my slayer.\n:Rooted I stand on a high bed.\n:I am shaggy below. Sometimes the beautiful\n:Peasant's daughter, an eager-armed,\n:Proud woman grabs my body,\n:Rushes my red skin, holds me hard,\n:Claims my head. The curly-haired\n:Woman who catches me fast will feel\n:Our meeting. Her eye will be wet.<ref name=\"Broadview\"/>\n\n:<sup>Trans. by Craig Williamson, ''A Feast of Creatures: Anglo-Saxon Riddle-Songs'' (1982)</sup>\n\nOne of the first answers that readers might think of would be an onion. If the reader pays close attention to the wording in the latter half of the riddle, however, he or she may be led to believe that the answer is a man's penis. Both of these answers are perfectly legitimate answers to this riddle, but one is very innocent where the other is very obscene.  Even though some of the riddles contained obscene meanings, that is not to say that the majority of riddles in the Exeter Book were obscene. There were more religious and animalistic riddles than obscene riddles.\n\nSince the riddles were crammed into the pages of the manuscript with hardly any organization, many of the riddles vary in structure.  The boundaries between riddles were often unclear and translations are relatively rough.<ref name=Rios/> The object of the riddles is generally preserved despite these possible errors.  Notably, not a single one of the riddles found in the Exeter book were accompanied with answers.  In fact, some remain unanswered to this day, such as Riddle 91:\n\n:I am noble, known to rest in the quiet\n:Keeping of many men, humble and high born.\n:The plunderers\u2019 joy, hauled far from friends,\n:Rides richly on me, shines signifying power,\n:Whether I proclaim the grandeur of halls,\n:The wealth of cities, or the glory of God.\n:Now wise men love most my strange way\n:Of offering wisdom to many without voice.\n:Though the children of earth eagerly seek\n:To trace my trail, sometimes my tracks are dim.<ref name=\"Broadview\"/>\n\n:<sup>Trans. by Craig Williamson, ''A Feast of Creatures: Anglo-Saxon Riddle-Songs'' (1982)</sup>\n\n===Types of riddles in the Exeter Book===\nAccording to [[Archer Taylor]],<ref name=\"Lind\"/> most riddles from the Exeter Book are 'true riddles' and can be placed into five categories: \n* the true riddle \n* the [[neck-riddle]]\n* the arithmetical puzzle \n* the clever question\n* the [[wikt:conundrum|conundrum]] ([[joke riddle]])\n\n[[Nigel F.

Overall mortality of patients in the ZMapp and remdesivir groups were 49% and 53% compared to 34% and 29% for mAb114 and REGN-EB3.

While the study was not [[Power (statistics)|powered]] to determine whether there is any difference between REGN-EB3 and mAb114, the survival difference between those two therapies and ZMapp was significant.

of a number of [[religious war]]s initiated, supported and sometimes directed by the [[Latin Church]] in the [[medieval period]]. The initial objective was the recovery of the [[Holy Land]] from [[Muslim conquests|Islamic rule]]. These campaigns were subsequently given the name [[crusades]]. The first iniative for this crusade began in 1095 when the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]], [[Alexios I Komnenos]], requested military support from the [[Council of Piacenza]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]]'s conflict with the Seljuk Turks. This was followed later in that year by the Council of Clermont where Pope Urban supported this request for military assistance and also urged for an armed pilgrimage to Jerusalem. This call was met with an enthusiastic popular response across all social classes in western Europe. Mobs of predominantly poor Christians numbering in the thousands led by a [[Peter the Hermit]], a French priest, responded first. What has become known as known as the [[People's Crusade]] passed through Germany and indulged in wide-ranging [[History of the Jews in Germany|anti-Jewish]] activities and [[Rhineland massacres|massacres]]. On leaving Byzantine-controlled territory in [[Byzantine Anatolia|Anatolia]] they were annihilated in a Turkish ambush at the [[Battle of Civetot]] in October 1096.\n\nIn what has become known as the '''Princes' Crusade''' members of the high nobility and their followers embarked in late summer 1096 and arrived at [[Constantinople]] between November and April the following year. This was a feudal host led by five princes: [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]]; the [[Italo-Normans]] [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]] and his nephew [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]]; the brothers [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] and [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin]] who led forces from [[Lotharingia]] and [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]]. The army was further augmented by northern French forces under [[Robert Curthose]]; Count [[Stephen, Count of Blois]]; and [[Robert II, Count of Flanders|Robert]]. In total and including non-combatants the army could possible be estimated as numbering 100,000. The crusaders marched into Anatolia. While the [[List of Seljuk sultans of R\u00fbm|Seljuk Sultan of R\u00fbm]], [[Kilij Arslan I|Kilij Arslan]], was away resolving a dispute a Frankish [[Siege of Nicaea|siege]] and Byzantine naval assault captured [[Siege of Nicaea|captured ]] Nicea in June 1097. In marching through Anatolia, the crusaders suffered starvation, thirst and disease before gaining experience of the Turkish lightly armoured mounted archers at the [[Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)|Battle of Dorylaeum]]. Baldwin left with a small force to establish the [[County of Edessa]], the first Crusader state and [[Siege of Antioch|Antioch]] was captured in June 1098. Jerusalem was reached in June 1099 and the city was taken by [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|assault]] on 7 July 1099, massacring the defenders. A counter attack was repulsed at the [[Battle of Ascalon]]. After this the majority of the crusaders returned home.\n\nFour [[Crusader states]] were established in the [[Near East]]: the [[County of Edessa]], the [[Principality of Antioch]], the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and the [[County of Tripoli]]. The crusader presence remained in the region in some form until the city of [[Siege of Acre (1291)|Acre fell]] in 1291 leading to the rapid loss of all remaining territory in the [[Levant]]. There were no further substantive attempts to recover the Holy Land after this.\n\n==Historical context==\nThe causes of the Crusades in general, and particularly of the First Crusade, is [[#Historiographical debate|widely debated among historians]]. \nWhile the relative weight or importance of the various factors may be the subject of ongoing disputes, it is clear that the First Crusade came about from a combination of factors in both Europe and the Near East. Its origin is linked both with the political situation in Catholic Christendom, including the political and social situation in 11th-century Europe, the [[Gregorian Reform]] within the [[Pope|papacy]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Crusades and the expansion of Catholic Christendom|last=France|first=John|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|location=New York|pages=64}}</ref> as well as the military and religious confrontation of Christianity and Islam in the East.\n\nChristianity had been adopted throughout the [[Roman Empire]] in [[Late Antiquity]], but in the 7th to 8th centuries, the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] had [[Muslim conquest of Syria|conquered Syria]], [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]], and [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|North Africa]] from the predominantly Christian Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire, and [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Hispania]] from the [[Visigothic Kingdom]].<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=51\u201354}}.</ref> In North Africa, the Umayyad empire eventually collapsed and a number of smaller Muslim kingdoms emerged, such as the [[Aghlabids]], who attacked [[Italy]] in the [[Christianity in the 9th century|9th century]]. [[Pisa]], [[Genoa]], and the [[Principality of Catalonia]] began to battle various Muslim kingdoms for control of the [[Mediterranean Basin]], exemplified by the [[Mahdia campaign of 1087]] and battles at [[Majorca]] and [[Sardinia]].<ref>[[H.

At the same time, the reform-minded papacy came into conflict with the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s, resulting in the [[Investiture Controversy]]. Popes such as [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] justified the subsequent warfare against the Emperor's partisans in theological terms. It became acceptable for the Pope to utilize knights in the name of [[Christendom]], not only against political enemies of the Papacy, but also against [[Al-Andalus]], or, theoretically, against the [[Seljuq dynasty]] in the east.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1991|pp=5\u20138}}.</ref>\n\nTo the east of Europe lay the Byzantine Empire, composed of Christians who had long followed a separate [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] rite; the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches had been [[East\u2013West Schism|in schism]] since 1054.

The Seljuq Turks had taken over almost all of Anatolia after the Byzantine defeat at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071; however, their conquests were piecemeal and led by semi-independent warlords, rather than by the sultan.

There were signs of considerable co-operation between [[Rome]] and [[Constantinople]] in the years immediately before the crusade.<ref>{{harvnb|Frankopan|2012|pp=19\u201323}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1095, Urban turned to his homeland of France to recruit men for the expedition. His travels there culminated in the ten-day [[Council of Clermont]], where on Tuesday 27 November he gave an impassioned sermon to a large audience of French nobles and clergy. There are five versions of the speech recorded by people who may have been at the council ([[Baldric of Dol]], [[Guibert of Nogent]], [[Robert the Monk]], and [[Fulcher of Chartres]]) or who went on crusade (Fulcher and the anonymous author of the [[Gesta Francorum]]), as well as other versions found in later historians (such as [[William of Malmesbury]] and William of Tyre). All of these versions were written after Jerusalem had been captured. Thus it is difficult to know what was actually said and what was recreated in the aftermath of the successful crusade. The only contemporary records are a few letters written by Urban in 1095.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=32}}.</ref>\n\nThe five versions of the speech differ widely from one another in regard to particulars, but all versions except that in the Gesta Francorum agree that Urban talked about the violence of European society and the necessity of maintaining the Peace of God; about helping the Greeks, who had asked for assistance; about the crimes being committed against Christians in the east; and about a new kind of war, an armed pilgrimage, and of rewards in heaven, where remission of sins was offered to any who might die in the undertaking.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=31\u201339}}</ref> They do not all specifically mention Jerusalem as the ultimate goal.

Urban had planned the departure of the first crusade for 15 August 1096, the [[Assumption of Mary|Feast of the Assumption]], but months before this, a number of unexpected armies of peasants and petty nobles set off for Jerusalem on their own, led by a charismatic priest called [[Peter the Hermit]]. Peter was the most successful of the preachers of Urban's message, and developed an almost hysterical enthusiasm among his followers, although he was probably not an \"official\" preacher sanctioned by Urban at Clermont.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=78\u201382}}.</ref> It is commonly believed that Peter's followers purely consisted of a massive group of untrained and illiterate peasants who did not even have any idea where Jerusalem was, but there were also many knights among the peasants, including [[Walter Sans Avoir]], who was lieutenant to Peter and led a separate army.<ref name=\"Riley-Smith, p. 28\">{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=28}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=82}}.</ref>\n\nLacking military discipline, in what likely seemed to the participants a strange land (Eastern Europe), Peter's fledgling army quickly found itself in trouble despite the fact they were still in Christian territory. The army led by Walter fought with the Hungarians over food at [[Belgrade]], but otherwise arrived in Constantinople unharmed. Meanwhile, the army led by Peter, which marched separately from Walter's army, also fought with the Hungarians, and may have captured Belgrade. At [[Ni\u0161|Nish]] the Byzantine governor tried to supply them, but Peter had little control over his followers and Byzantine troops were needed to quell their attacks. Peter arrived at Constantinople in August, where his army joined with the one led by Walter, which had already arrived, as well as separate bands of crusaders from France, Germany, and Italy. Another army of [[Bohemia]]ns and [[Saxony|Saxons]] did not make it past Hungary before splitting up.<ref name=\"Riley-Smith, p. 28\" />\n\nThis unruly mob began to attack and pillage outside the city in search of supplies and food, prompting Alexios to hurriedly ferry the gathering across the [[Bosphorus|Bosporus]] one week later.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|pp=26\u201327}}.</ref> After crossing into Asia Minor, the crusaders split up and began to pillage the countryside, wandering into Seljuq territory around Nicaea. The greater experience of the Turks was overwhelming; and most of this group of the crusaders were massacred because of it. Some Italian and German crusaders were defeated and killed at Xerigordon at the end of August. Meanwhile, Walter and Peter's followers, who, although for the most part untrained in battle but led by about 50&nbsp;knights, fought a battle against the Turks [[Battle of Civetot|at Civetot]] in October. The Turkish archers destroyed the crusader army, and Walter was among the dead. Peter, who was absent in Constantinople at the time, later joined the main crusader army, along with the few survivors of Civetot.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=101\u2013103}}.</ref>\n\nAt a local level, the preaching of the First Crusade ignited the [[Rhineland massacres]] perpetrated against Jews, which some historians have deemed \"the first [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1991|p=50}}.</ref> At the end of 1095 and beginning of 1096, months before the departure of the official crusade in August, there were attacks on Jewish communities in France and Germany. In May 1096, [[Emicho|Emicho of Flonheim]] (sometimes incorrectly known as Emicho of Leiningen) attacked the Jews at Speyer and Worms. Other unofficial crusaders from Swabia, led by Hartmann of Dillingen, along with French, English, Lotharingian and Flemish volunteers, led by Drogo of Nesle and [[William the Carpenter]], as well as many locals, joined Emicho in the destruction of the Jewish community of Mainz at the end of May.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=84\u201385}}.</ref> In Mainz, one Jewish woman killed her children rather than see them killed; the chief rabbi, [[Kalonymus Ben Meshullam]], committed suicide in anticipation of being killed.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=102}}.</ref>\nEmicho's company then went on to Cologne, and others continued on to Trier, Metz, and other cities.<ref name=\"Tyerman, p. 103\">{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=103}}.</ref> Peter the Hermit may have been involved in violence against the Jews, and an army led by a priest named Folkmar also attacked Jews further east in Bohemia.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=24}}.</ref> Emicho's army eventually continued into Hungary but was defeated by the army of [[Coloman, King of Hungary|Coloman of Hungary]]. His followers dispersed; some eventually joined the main armies, although Emicho himself went home.<ref name=\"Tyerman, p. 103\" />\nMany of the attackers seem to have wanted to force the Jews to convert, although they were also interested in acquiring money from them. Physical violence against Jews was never part of the church hierarchy's official policy for crusading, and the Christian bishops, especially the Archbishop of Cologne, did their best to protect the Jews. A decade before, the Bishop of Speyer had taken the step of providing the Jews of that city with a walled ghetto to protect them from Christian violence and given their chief Rabbis the control of judicial matters in the quarter. Nevertheless, some also took money in return for their protection. The attacks may have originated in the belief that Jews and Muslims were equally enemies of Christ, and enemies were to be fought or converted to Christianity. Godfrey of Bouillon was rumoured to have extorted money from the Jews of Cologne and Mainz, and many of the Crusaders wondered why they should travel thousands of miles to fight non-believers when there were already non-believers closer to home.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=103\u2013106}}.</ref> \n\n==Princes' Crusade==\n{{anchor|Princes' Crusade}}\n[[File:First.Crusade.Map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Routes of the leaders of the First Crusade]]\n\nThe four main crusader armies left Europe around the appointed time in August 1096. They took different paths to Constantinople and gathered outside its [[Walls of Constantinople|city walls]] between November 1096 and April 1097; Hugh of Vermandois arrived first, followed by Godfrey, Raymond, and Bohemond. This time, Emperor Alexios was more prepared for the crusaders; there were fewer incidents of violence along the way.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=103\u2013105}}.</ref> It is impossible to estimate the numbers involved. Some historians put a figure of 70,000 to 80,000 on the number who left Western Europe in the year after Clermont, and more joined in the three year duration.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=75}} Estimates for the number of Knights range from 7,000 to 10,000; 35,000 to 50,000 foot soldiers; and including non-combatants a total of 60,000 to 100,000.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=42}}\n\n===Recruitment===\n{{see|Christian Forces of the First Crusades|Army of Godfrey of Bouillon|Army of Hugh the Great|Army of Robert Curthose|Armies of Bohemond of Taranto}}\nUrban's speech had been well-planned: he had discussed the crusade with [[Adhemar of Le Puy]] and [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]], and instantly the expedition had the support of two of southern France's most important leaders. Adhemar himself was present at the Council and was the first to \"take the cross\". During the rest of 1095 and into 1096, Urban spread the message throughout France, and urged his bishops and legates to preach in their own dioceses elsewhere in France, Germany, and Italy as well. However, it is clear that the response to the speech was much greater than even the Pope, let alone Alexios, expected. On his tour of France, Urban tried to forbid certain people (including women, monks, and the sick) from joining the crusade, but found this nearly impossible. In the end, most who took up the call were not knights, but peasants who were not wealthy and had little in the way of fighting skills, in an outpouring of a new emotional and personal piety that was not easily harnessed by the ecclesiastical and lay aristocracy.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=46\u201349}}.</ref> Typically, preaching would conclude with every volunteer taking a vow to complete a pilgrimage to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre; they were also given a cross, usually sewn onto their clothes.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=65\u201366}}.</ref>\n\nAs Thomas Asbridge wrote, \"Just as we can do nothing more than estimate the number of thousands who responded to the crusading ideal, so too, with the surviving evidence, we can gain only a limited insight into their motivation and intent.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=41}}.</ref> Previous generations of scholars argued that the crusaders were motivated by greed, hoping to find a better life away from the famines and warfare occurring in France, but as Asbridge notes, \"This image is ... profoundly misleading.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=68}}.</ref> He argues that greed was unlikely to have been a major factor because of the extremely high cost of travelling so far from home, and because almost all of the crusaders eventually returned home after completing their pilgrimage rather than trying to carve out possessions for themselves in the Holy Land.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=69}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1998|p=15}}.</ref> It is difficult or impossible to assess the motives of the thousands of poor for whom there is no historical record, or even those of important knights, whose stories were usually retold by monks or clerics. As the secular medieval world was so deeply ingrained with the spiritual world of the church, it is quite likely that personal piety was a major factor for many crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=69\u201371}}.</ref>\n\nDespite this popular enthusiasm, however, Urban ensured that there would be an army of knights, drawn from the French aristocracy. Aside from Adhemar and Raymond, other leaders he recruited throughout 1096 included [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]], a southern Italian ally of the reform popes; Bohemond's nephew [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]]; [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], who had previously been an anti-reform ally of the Holy Roman Emperor; his brother [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin of Boulogne]]; [[Hugh I, Count of Vermandois]], brother of the excommunicated [[Philip I of France]]; [[Robert Curthose]], brother of [[William II of England]]; and his relatives [[Stephen II, Count of Blois]] and [[Robert II, Count of Flanders]]. The crusaders represented northern and southern France, Flanders, Germany, and southern Italy, and so were divided into four separate armies that were not always cooperative, though they were held together by their common ultimate goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=55\u201365}}.</ref>\n\nThe motives of the nobility are somewhat clearer than those of the peasants; greed was apparently not a major factor. Runciman (1951) assumed that only younger members of a family went on crusade, looking for wealth and adventure elsewhere, as they had no prospects for advancement at home. Riley-Smith (1998) has shown that this was not always the case. The crusade was led by some of the most powerful nobles of France, who left everything behind, and it was often the case that entire families went on crusade at their own great expense.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1998|p=21}}.</ref> \nFor example, Robert of Normandy loaned the [[Duchy of Normandy]] to his brother William II of England, and Godfrey sold or mortgaged his property to the church.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=77}}.</ref> According to Tancred's biographer, he was worried about the sinful nature of knightly warfare, and was excited to find a holy outlet for violence.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=71}}.</ref> Tancred and Bohemond, as well as Godfrey, Baldwin, and their older brother [[Eustace III, Count of Boulogne]], are examples of families who crusaded together. Riley-Smith argues that the enthusiasm for the crusade was perhaps based on family relations, as most of the French crusaders were distant relatives.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1998|pp=93\u201397}}.</ref> Nevertheless, in at least some cases, personal advancement played a role in Crusaders' motives. For instance, Bohemond was motivated by the desire to carve himself out a territory in the east, and had previously campaigned against the Byzantines to try to achieve this. The Crusade gave him a further opportunity, which he took after the [[Siege of Antioch]], taking possession of the city and establishing the Principality of Antioch.<ref name=\"Neveux186\">{{harvnb|Neveux|2008|pp=186\u2013188}}.</ref>\n\nThe size of the entire crusader army is difficult to estimate; various numbers were given by the eyewitnesses, and equally various estimates have been offered by modern historians. Crusader military historian [[David Nicolle]] considers the armies to have consisted of about 30,000\u201335,000 crusaders, including 5,000 [[cavalry]]. Raymond had the largest contingent of about 8,500 [[infantry]] and 1,200 cavalry.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolle|2003|pp=21, 32}}.</ref>\n\nThe princes arrived in Constantinople with little food and expected provisions and help from Alexios. Alexios was understandably suspicious after his experiences with the People's Crusade, and also because the knights included his old Norman enemy, Bohemond, who had invaded Byzantine territory on numerous occasions with his father, [[Robert Guiscard]], and may have even attempted to organize an attack on Constantinople while encamped outside the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=106}}.</ref>\n\nThe crusaders may have expected Alexios to become their leader, but he had no interest in joining them, and was mainly concerned with transporting them into Asia Minor as quickly as possible.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=110}}.</ref> In return for food and supplies, Alexios requested the leaders to swear [[fealty]] to him and promise to return to the Byzantine Empire any land recovered from the Turks. Godfrey was the first to take the oath, and almost all the other leaders followed him, although they did so only after warfare had almost broken out in the city between the citizens and the crusaders, who were eager to pillage for supplies. Raymond alone avoided swearing the oath, instead pledging that he would simply cause no harm to the Empire. Before ensuring that the various armies were shuttled across the Bosporus, Alexios advised the leaders on how best to deal with the Seljuq armies that they would soon encounter.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=110\u2013113}}.</ref>\n\n===Siege of Nicaea===\n{{Main|Siege of Nicaea}}\n\nThe Crusader armies crossed over into Asia Minor during the first half of 1097, where they were joined by Peter the Hermit and the remainder of his relatively small army. In addition, Alexios also sent two of his own generals, [[Manuel Boutoumites]] and [[Tatikios]], to assist the crusaders. The first objective of their campaign was [[Nicaea]], previously a city under Byzantine rule, but which had become the capital of the Seljuq [[Sultanate of Rum]] under [[Kilij Arslan I]]. Arslan was away campaigning against the [[Danishmends]] in central Anatolia at the time, and had left behind his treasury and his family, underestimating the strength of these new crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=117\u2013120}}.</ref>\n\nSubsequently, upon the Crusaders' arrival, the city was subjected to a lengthy siege, and when Arslan had word of it he rushed back to Nicaea and attacked the crusader army on 16 May. He was driven back by the unexpectedly large crusader force, with heavy losses being suffered on both sides in the ensuing battle.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=124\u2013126}}.</ref> The siege continued, but the crusaders had little success as they found they could not blockade [[Lake \u0130znik|the lake]], which the city was situated on, and from which it could be provisioned.  To break the city, Alexios sent the Crusaders' ships rolled over land on logs, and at the sight of them the Turkish garrison finally surrendered on 18 June.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=126\u2013130}}.</ref> \n\nThere was some discontent amongst the Franks who were forbidden from looting the city. This was ameliorated by Alexius financially rewarding the crusaders. Later chronicles exagerate tension between the Greeks and Franks but Stephen of Blois, in a letter to his wife [[Adela of Normandy|Adela of Blois]]  confirms goodwill and cooperation continued at this point.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=55}} As Thomas Asbridge writes, \"the fall of Nicaea was a product of the successful policy of close co-operation between the crusaders and Byzantium.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=130}}.</ref> \n\n===Battle of Dorylaeum===\n{{Main|Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)}}\n\n[[File:Baldwin of Boulogne entering Edessa in Feb 1098.JPG|thumb|230px|right|[[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin of Boulogne]] entering [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] in 1098 ([[history painting]], [[Joseph-Nicolas Robert-Fleury]] 1840)]]\n\nAt the end of June, the crusaders marched on through Anatolia. They were accompanied by some Byzantine troops under Tatikios, and still harboured the hope that Alexios would send a full Byzantine army after them. They also divided the army into two more-easily managed groups\u2014one contingent led by the Normans, the other by the French.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=132\u201334}}.</ref> The two groups intended to meet again at [[Dorylaeum]], but on 1 July the Normans, who had marched ahead of the French, were attacked by Kilij Arslan. Arslan had gathered a much larger army than he previously had after his defeat at Nicaea, and now surrounded the Normans with his fast-moving mounted archers. The Normans \"deployed in a tight-knit defensive formation\",<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=135}}.</ref> surrounding all their equipment and the non-combatants who had followed them along the journey, and sent for help from the other group. When the French arrived, Godfrey broke through the Turkish lines and the legate Adhemar outflanked the Turks from the rear; thus the Turks, who had expected to destroy the Normans and did not anticipate the quick arrival of the French, fled rather than face the combined crusader army.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=135\u201337}}.</ref>\n\nThe crusaders' march through Anatolia was thereafter unopposed, but the journey was unpleasant, as Arslan had burned and destroyed everything he left behind in his army's flight. It was the middle of summer, and the crusaders had very little food and water; many men and horses died.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=138\u201339}}.</ref> Fellow Christians sometimes gave them gifts of food and money, but more often than not, the crusaders simply looted and pillaged whenever the opportunity presented itself. Individual leaders continued to dispute the overall leadership, although none of them were powerful enough to take command on their own, as Adhemar was always recognized as the spiritual leader. After passing through the [[Cilician Gates]], Baldwin of Boulogne set off on his own towards the Armenian lands around the [[Euphrates]]; his wife, his only claim to European lands and wealth, had died after the battle, giving Baldwin no incentive to return to Europe. Thus, he resolved to seize a fiefdom for himself in the Holy Land. Early in 1098, he was adopted as heir by [[Thoros of Edessa]], a ruler who was disliked by his Armenian subjects for his [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] religion. Thoros was later killed, during an uprising that Baldwin may have instigated.<ref name=\"Hindley37\">{{harvnb|Hindley|2004|p=37}}.</ref> Then, in March 1098, Baldwin became the new ruler, thus creating the [[County of Edessa]], the first of the crusader states.<ref name=\"Hindley37\" /><ref name=\"Runciman149\">{{harvnb|Runciman|1980|p=149}}.</ref>\n\n===Siege of Antioch===\n{{Main|Siege of Antioch|Ya\u011f\u0131s\u0131yan}}\n{{See also|Tafurs}}\n\n[[File:Gustave dore crusades bohemond alone mounts the rampart of antioch.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]] Alone Mounts the Rampart of [[Antioch]]'' by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] (1871)|alt=Bohemond of Taranto is illuminated in the engraving as he is shown being the only one climbing the rampart of Antioch.

Described by Stephen of Blois as \"a city great beyond belief, very strong and unassailable\", the idea of taking the city by assault was a discouraging one to the crusaders.<ref name=\"Hindley28\">{{harvnb|Hindley|2004|p=38}}.</ref> Hoping rather to force a capitulation, or find a traitor inside the city\u2014a tactic that had previously seen Antioch change to the control of the Byzantines and then the Seljuq Turks\u2014the crusader army set Antioch to siege on 20 October 1097.<ref name=\"Hindley39\">{{harvnb|Hindley|2004|p=39}}</ref> Antioch was so large that the crusaders did not have enough troops to fully surround it, and as a result it was able to stay partially supplied.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=135}}.</ref> \n\nBy January the attritional eight month siege led to hundreds, or possibly thousands, of crusaders dieing of starvation. Adhemar considered this was caused by their sinful nature; woman were expelled from the camp, fasting, prayer, almsgiving and procession undertaken. Many, such as Stephen of Blois,  deserted. Foraging systems eased the situation, as did supplies from Cicilia, Edessa, through the recently captured ports of [[Latakia]] and [[Port Saint Symeon]] and in March  a small English fleet.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=68\u201369}} The Franks benefited from disunity in the Muslim world and the possible misunderstanding that they were thought to be Byzantine merceneries. The Seljuk brothers,[[Duqaq]] of Syria and [[Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan]] of Aleppo dispatched separate relief armies in December and Febuary that if they had been combined would probably have been victorious.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=71}} In response to these failures the [[Atabeg]] of [[Mosul]] raised a coalition from southern Syria, nothern Iraq and Anatolia with the ambition of extending his power from Syria to the Mediterranean sea. Bohemond persuaded that other leaders that in Antioch fell he would keep it for himself and that an Armenian commander of a section of the cities walls had agreed to enable the crusaders to enter. Stephen of Blois had been his only competitor and while deserting his message to Alexius that the cause was lost persuaded the Emperor to halt his advance through Anatolia at [[Philomelium]] before returning to Constantinople. Alexius failure to reach the seige was used by Bohemond to rationalise his refusal to return the city to the Empire as promised.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=87\u201388}} The Armenian, [[Firouz]], helped Bohemond and a small party enter the city on the 2nd June and open a gate at which point horns were sounded, the city's Christian majority opened the other gates and the crusaders entered. In the sack they killed most of the Muslim inhabitants and many Christian Greeks, Syrians and Armenians in the confusion.\n\nOn 4 June the vanguard of Kerbogha's 40,000 strong army arrived surrounding the Franks. From the 10 Junes for 4 days waves of Kerbogha's men assailed the city walls from dawn until dusk. Bohemond and Adhemar barred the city gates to prevent mass desertions and managed to hold out. Kerbogha then changed tactics to trying to starve the crusaders out. Morale inside the city was low and defeat looked imminent but a peasant visionary called [[Peter Bartholomew]] claimed the apostle [[St Andrew]] came to him to show the location of the [[Holy Lance]] that had pierced Christ on the cross. This supposedly encouraged the crusaders but the accounts are misleading as it was two weeks before the final battle for the city. On the 24 June the Franks sought terms for surrender that were refused. On 28 June 1098 at dawn the Franks marched out of the city in four battle groups to engage the enemy. Kerbogha allowed them to deploy with the aim of destroying them in the open. However the discipline of the Muslim army did not hold and a disorderly attack was launched. Unable to overrun a bedraggled force they outnumbered two to one Muslims attacking the Bridge Gate fled through the advancing main body of the Muslim army. With very few casualities the Muslim army broke and fled the battle.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=74\u201382}} \n\nStephen of Blois, a Crusade leader, was in [[Alexandretta]] when he learned of the situation in Antioch. It seemed like their situation was hopeless so he left the Middle East, warning Alexios and his army on his way back to France.<ref>Madden 2006, 28</ref> Because of what looked like a massive betrayal, the leaders at Antioch, most notably Bohemond, argued that Alexios had deserted the Crusade and thus invalidated all of their oaths to him. While Bohemond asserted his claim to Antioch, not everyone agreed (most notably Raymond of Toulouse), so the crusade was delayed for the rest of the year while the nobles argued amongst themselves. When discussing this period, a common historiographical viewpoint advanced by some scholars is that the [[Franks]] of northern France, the [[Provence|Proven\u00e7als]] of southern France, and the [[Normans]] of southern Italy considered themselves separate \"nations\", creating turmoil as each tried to increase its individual status. Others argue that while this may have had something to do with the disputes, personal ambition among the Crusader leaders might just be as easily blamed.<ref name=\"Neveux186\" />\n\nMeanwhile, a plague broke out, killing many among the army, including the legate Adhemar, who died on 1 August.<ref name=\"Lock23\">{{harvnb|Lock|2006|p=23}}.</ref> There were now even fewer horses than before, and worse, the Muslim peasants in the area refused to supply the crusaders with food. Thus, in December, after the Arab town of [[Ma'arrat al-Numan]] was captured following [[Siege of Ma'arrat al-Numan|a siege]], history describes the first occurrence of [[cannibalism]] among the crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Runciman|1951|p=261}}.</ref> Radulph of Caen wrote, \"In Ma'arrat our troops boiled pagan adults in cooking pots; they impaled children on spits and devoured them grilled.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Hotaling|2003|p=114}}</ref> At the same time, the minor knights and soldiers had become increasingly restless and threatened to continue to Jerusalem without their squabbling leaders.

Here there was no prospect of relief, even as they feared an imminent attack by the local Fatimid rulers. There was no hope of trying to blockade the city as they had at Antioch; the crusaders had insufficient troops, supplies, and time. Rather, they resolved to take the city by assault.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" /> They might have been left with little choice, as by the time the Crusader army reached Jerusalem, it has been estimated that only about 12,000 men including 1,500 cavalry remained.<ref name=\"crusadearmy\">{{harvnb|Konstam|2004|p=133}}.</ref> These contingents, composed of men with differing origins and varying allegiances, were also approaching another low ebb in their camaraderie; e.g., while Godfrey and Tancred made camp to the north of the city, Raymond made his to the south. In addition, the Proven\u00e7al contingent did not take part in the initial assault on 13 June. This first assault was perhaps more speculative than determined, and after scaling the outer wall the Crusaders were repulsed from the inner one.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" />\n\nAfter the failure of the initial assault, a meeting between the various leaders was organized in which it was agreed upon that a more concerted attack would be required in the future. On 17 June, a party of Genoese mariners under [[Guglielmo Embriaco]] arrived at [[Jaffa]], and provided the Crusaders with skilled engineers, and perhaps more critically, supplies of timber (stripped from the ships) to build [[siege engine]]s.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" /> The Crusaders' morale was raised when a priest, Peter Desiderius, claimed to have had a divine vision, of Bishop Adhemar, instructing them to fast and then march in a barefoot procession around the city walls, after which the city would fall, following the Biblical story of [[Joshua]] at the siege of [[Tell es-Sultan|Jericho]].<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" /> After a three-day fast, on 8 July the crusaders performed the procession as they had been instructed by Desiderius, ending on the Mount of Olives where Peter the Hermit preached to them,<ref>Runciman284</ref> and shortly afterward the various bickering factions arrived at a public rapprochement. News arrived shortly after that a Fatimid relief army had set off from Egypt, giving the Crusaders a very strong incentive to make another assault on the city.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" />\n\nThe final assault on Jerusalem began on 13 July; Raymond's troops attacked the south gate while the other contingents attacked the northern wall. Initially the Proven\u00e7als at the southern gate made little headway, but the contingents at the northern wall fared better, with a slow but steady attrition of the defence. On 15 July, a final push was launched at both ends of the city, and eventually the inner rampart of the northern wall was captured. In the ensuing panic, the defenders abandoned the walls of the city at both ends, allowing the Crusaders to finally enter.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\">{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=157\u2013159}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1099 Siege of Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|Siege of Jerusalem]] as depicted in a medieval manuscript]]\nThe massacre that followed the capture of Jerusalem has attained particular notoriety, as a \"juxtaposition of extreme violence and anguished faith\".<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=159}}.</ref> The eyewitness accounts from the crusaders themselves leave little doubt that there was great slaughter in the aftermath of the siege. Nevertheless, some historians propose that the scale of the massacre has been exaggerated in later medieval sources.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Madden|2005|p=34}}</ref>\n\nAfter the successful assault on the northern wall, the defenders fled to the [[Temple Mount]], pursued by Tancred and his men. Arriving before the defenders could secure the area, Tancred's men assaulted the precinct, butchering many of the defenders, with the remainder taking refuge in the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]]. Tancred then called a halt to the slaughter, offering those in the mosque his protection.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" /> When the defenders on the southern wall heard of the fall of the northern wall, they fled to the citadel, allowing Raymond and the Proven\u00e7als to enter the city. [[Iftikhar al-Dawla]], the commander of the garrison, struck a deal with Raymond, surrendering the citadel in return for being granted safe passage to [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]].<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" />\n\nThe slaughter continued for the rest of the day; Muslims were indiscriminately killed, and Jews who had taken refuge in their synagogue died when it was burnt down by the Crusaders. The following day, Tancred's prisoners in the mosque were slaughtered. Nevertheless, it is clear that some Muslims and Jews of the city survived the massacre, either escaping or being taken prisoner to be ransomed.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" /> The Eastern Christian population of the city had been expelled before the siege by the governor, and thus escaped the massacre.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" />\n\n===Establishment of the Kingdom of Jerusalem===\n[[File:Crusader Graffiti in the Church of the holy supulchure Jerusalem Victor 2011 -1-21.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Crusader graffiti in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], [[Jerusalem]]]]\n\nOn 22 July, a council was held in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] to establish governance for Jerusalem. The death of the Greek Patriach meant there was no obvious candidate to establish an ecclesiastical realm the clergy contended. Raymond of Toulouse's support had waned since Arqa so Godfrey accepted the title [[Defender of the Holy Sepulchre]] and took secular power. Raymond was incensed at this development, attempted to seize the [[Tower of David]] before leaving the city.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=42}} The exact nature and meaning of Godfrey's title is somewhat controversial. Although it is widely claimed that he took the title ''Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri'' (\"advocate\" or \"defender\" of the Holy Sepulchre), this title is only used in a letter that was not written by Godfrey. Instead, Godfrey himself seems to have used the more ambiguous term ''princeps'', or simply retained his title of ''dux'' from Lower Lorraine. According to William of Tyre, writing in the later 12th century when Godfrey was already a legendary hero in crusader Jerusalem, he refused to wear \"a crown of gold\" where Christ had worn \"a crown of thorns\".<ref>William of Tyre, [http://thelatinlibrary.com/williamtyre/9.html#9 Book 9, Chapter 9].</ref> [[Robert the Monk]] is the only contemporary chronicler of the crusade to report that Godfrey took the title \"king\".<ref>Riley-Smith (1979), \"The Title of Godfrey of Bouillon\", ''Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research'' '''52''', pp. 83\u201386.</ref><ref>Murray, Alan V.

Outnumbered two to one the Franks launched a surprise dawn attack and routed the over confident and unprepared Muslim force. The opportunity was wasted though, as squabling between Raymond and Godfrey prevented an attempt by the city's garrison to surrender to the more trusted Raymond.

The life of Godfrey of Bouillon became legendary even within a few years of his death.<ref>{{harvnb|Baldwin|1969|pp=379\u2013380}}.</ref> In some cases, the political situation at home was greatly affected by crusader absences. For instance, while Robert Curthose was away on crusade the throne of England had passed to his brother [[Henry I of England]] instead, and their resultant conflict led to the [[Battle of Tinchebray]] in 1106.<ref>{{harvnb|Neveux|2008|pp=176\u2013177}}.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the establishment of the crusader states in the east helped ease Seljuq pressure on the Byzantine Empire, which had regained some of its Anatolian territory with crusader help, and experienced a period of relative peace and prosperity in the 12th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Baldwin|1969|pp=404\u2013405}}.</ref> The effect on the Muslim dynasties of the east was gradual but important. In the wake of the death of Malik Shah I in 1092, political instability and the division of the [[Great Seljuq Empire]] prevented a coherent defence against the Latin states. Cooperation between them remained difficult for many decades, but from Egypt to Syria to Baghdad there were calls for the expulsion of the crusaders,<ref>{{harvnb|Baldwin|1969|pp=443\u2013447}}.</ref> culminating in the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|recapture]] of Jerusalem under [[Saladin]] later in the century when the [[Ayyubid]]s had united the surrounding areas.<ref>{{harvnb|Baldwin|1969|pp=616\u2013620}}.</ref>\n\nThe success of the crusade inspired the literary imagination of poets in France, who, in the 12th century, began to compose various ''[[chansons de geste]]'' celebrating the exploits of Godfrey of Bouillon and other crusaders. Some of these, such as the [[Chanson d'Antioche]], are semi-historical, while others are completely fanciful, describing battles with a dragon or connecting Godfrey's ancestors to the legend of the [[Knight of the Swan]].

Following the [[Battle of Manzikert|defeat]] at [[Malazgirt|Manzikert]] in 1071, Muslims had taken half of the Byzantine Empire's territory, and such strategically and religiously important cities as Antioch and Nicaea had only fallen to Muslims in the decade before the [[Council of Piacenza]].<ref name=\"treadgold\" /> Moreover, the harrowing accounts of the atrocities committed by the invaders against the Anatolian population recorded by Eastern Christian chroniclers such as [[John Skylitzes]], [[Michael Attaleiates]], [[Matthew of Edessa]], Michael the Syrian and others (summarized Vryonis 1971) align with the primary motivation of relieving the acute distress suffered by the Byzantine empire.\nIn addition, the early 11th century saw a worsening of Muslim-Christian relations in the Levant; for example, in 1009 the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] had been [[Destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre 1009|destroyed]] by the Fatimid Caliph [[al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]]; [[Pope Sergius IV]] had supposedly already called for a military expedition in response to this.<ref>\nThe bull attributed to Sergius was considered genuine by Erdmann (1935), but its authenticity was later called into question.

A theory proposed by [[Carl Erdmann]] (1935), known as the \"Erdmann thesis\", links the First Crusade l to the [[Gregorian Reform]], the series of reforms initiated by [[Pope Gregory VII]] during c. 1050\u201380. These reforms re-established the [[Western Christianity|Western Church]], which had been [[Saeculum obscurum|much weakened]] during the 10th century, as a relevant power able to inspire and co-ordinate the crusades.<ref>Erdmann (1935), ''Die Entstehung des Kreuzzugsgedankens''. Translated into English as ''The Origin of the Idea of Crusade'' by Marshall W. Baldwin and Walter Goffart in 1977.</ref> \nThe \"Erdmann thesis\" proposes that the strengthened Western Church, combined with the weakened Byzantine Empire, permitted a projection of power from west to east, with the actual conquest of Jerusalem figuring at best as a secondary, popular goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1991|p=1}}.</ref>\n\nWhile it is clear that the motivations for and causes of the First Crusade are to be sought both in the East and in the West, there has still been much debate among historiographers of the later 20th century on how the relative impact of such causes should be weighed.\n\nThe very influential [[Steven Runciman]] (1951) significantly shaped the popular perception of the crusades in the later 20th century. Runciman represents the view that the motivation for the crusades was primarily that of a \"barbarian invasion\" motivated by greed and the desire for spoils and adventure among the Frankish nobles.<ref>Riddle (2008) says that for his day Runciman was the \"greatest historian of the Crusades.\" He reports that, \"Prior to Runciman, in the early part of the [20th] century, historians related the Crusades as an idealistic attempt of Christendom to push Islam back.\" Runciman regarded the Crusades \"as a barbarian invasion of a superior civilization, not that of the Muslims but of the Byzantines.\" {{cite book|author=John M Riddle|title=A History of the Middle Ages, 300\u20131500|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rhWpPr93KjMC&pg=PA315|year=2008|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishing Group, Incorporated|page=315|isbn=9780742554092}}. Madden (2005) stresses the impact of Runciman's style and viewpoint: as having \"single-handedly crafted the current popular concept of the crusades\" by painting the crusaders as \"simpletons or barbarians\". {{cite book|author=Thomas F Madden|title=The New Concise History of the Crusades|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fKYxKsgVpmMC&pg=PA216|year=2005|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|page=216|isbn=9780742538221}}</ref> Runciman argued that the crusade was motivated by a combination of theological justification for holy war and a \"general restlessness and taste for adventure\", especially among the Normans and the \"younger sons\" of the French nobility who had no other opportunities.<ref>{{harvnb|Runciman|1980|p=76}}.</ref> and goes as far as suggesting that there wasn't any immediate threat from the Islamic world, arguing that \"in the middle of the 11th century the lot of the Christians in Palestine had seldom been so pleasant\".<ref>{{harvnb|Runciman|1980|p=31}}.</ref> \n\nIn a similar vein, [[Thomas Asbridge]] (2004) argues that the First Crusade was a strategic attempt to expand the power of the Western Church, and reunite the churches of Rome and Constantinople, which had been in [[East\u2013West Schism|schism since 1054]]. According to this view, the Islamic conquests were of little importance in this, as \"Islam and Christendom had coexisted for centuries in relative equanimity\".<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=17}}; for Urban's personal motives, see pp.&nbsp;19\u201321.</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, historians of the second half of the 20th century, such as [[Speros Vryonis]] (1971), have emphasized the importance of the military threat of Islamic expansion and the atrocities and attacks against Christians in Anatolia and the Levant.<ref name=\"Vryonis\">{{harvnb|Vryonis|1971|pp=85\u2013117}}.</ref>\nSimilarly, [[Moshe Gil]] (1997) argues against Runciman on the basis of contemporary Jewish [[Cairo Geniza]] documents, as well as later Muslim accounts, concluding that the Seljuq invasion of Anatolia and the occupation of Palestine (c.&nbsp;1073\u20131098) was a period of \"slaughter and vandalism, of economic hardship, and the uprooting of populations\".<ref>{{harvnb|Gil|1997|p=420}}; for details on the Seljuq occupation of Palestine, see pp.&nbsp;410\u2013420.</ref> Indeed, drawing upon earlier writers such as Ignatius of Melitene, [[Michael the Syrian]] had recorded that the Seljuqs subjected Coele-Syria and the Palestinian coast to \"cruel destruction and pillage\".<ref>''Chronique de Michel le Syrien'', pp.&nbsp;170\u2013171.</ref>\n\n[[Thomas F. Madden]] (2005) represents a view almost diametrically opposed to that of Asbridge (2004); while the crusade was certainly linked to church reform and attempts to assert papal authority, he argues that it was most importantly a pious struggle to liberate fellow Christians, who, Madden claims, \"had suffered mightily at the hands of the Turks\". This argument distinguishes the relatively recent violence and warfare that followed the conquests of the Turks from the general advance of Islam in the early medieval period, the significance of which had been dismissed by Runciman and Asbridge.<ref>{{harvnb|Madden|2005|p=7}}.</ref>\n \n[[Christopher Tyerman]] (2006) attempted a resolution by arguing for compound causes, presenting the First Crusade as developing out of the Western church reform and theories of holy war as much as being a response to conflicts with the Islamic world throughout Europe and the Middle East.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=56\u201357}}.</ref>\n\nIn the view of [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]] (2005), additional contingencies such as poor harvests, overpopulation, and a pre-existing movement towards colonizing the frontier areas of Europe have also contributed to the crusade; however, he also takes care to say that \"most commentators then and a minority of historians now have maintained that the chief motivation was a genuine idealism\".<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=17}}.</ref>\n\n[[Peter Frankopan]] (2012) has argued that the First Crusade has been fundamentally distorted by the attention paid by historians to western (Latin) sources, rather than Greek, Syriac, Armenian, Arabic and Hebrew material from the late 11th and 12th centuries. The expedition to Jerusalem, he argues, was conceived of not by the Pope but by the Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]], in response to a dramatic deterioration of Byzantium's position in Asia Minor and also as a result of a state of near anarchy at the imperial court where plans to depose Alexios or even murder him were an open secret by 1094. \nThe appeal to Pope [[Urban II]] was a desperate move to shore up Emperor and Empire. Frankopan\nfurther argues that the primary military targets of the First Crusade in Asia Minor \u2014 [[Nicaea]] and [[Antioch]] \u2014 required large numbers of soldiers with experience in siege warfare, precisely the type of force recruited by Urban in France in his call to arms of 1095/6.<ref>{{harvnb|Frankopan|2012|pp=87\u2013101}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Commons category|First Crusade}}\n\n* [[Christian Forces of the First Crusades]]\n** [[The Crusader Army of Godfrey of Bouillon]]\n** [[The Crusader Army of Hugh the Great]]\n** [[Army of Robert Curthose on the First Crusade|The Crusader Army of Robert Curthose]]\n* [[Second Crusade]]\n* [[Battle of Civetot]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Asbridge |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Asbridge |title=The First Crusade: A New History |publisher=Oxford |year=2004 |isbn=0-19-517823-8 |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/firstcrusadenewh00asbr }}\n* {{cite book|last=Asbridge|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Asbridge|title=The Crusades: The War for the Holy Land|year=2012|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|isbn=978-1-84983-688-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rK8nA9U0OE4C&dq=thomas+asbridge+the+crusades&source=gbs_navlinks_s|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Baldwin |first=Marshall W. |title=A History of the Crusades: The First Hundred Years |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |location=Madison, Wisconsin |year=1969 |url=http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/History.CrusOne |isbn=978-0-299-04834-1 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Bartlett |first=Robert |author-link=Robert Bartlett (historian) |title=The Making of Europe: Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change 950\u20131350 |publisher=Princeton |year=1994 |isbn=0-691-03780-9}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Chazan |first=Robert |title=In the Year 1096: The First Crusade and the Jews |publisher=Jewish Publication Society |year=1997 |isbn=0-8276-0575-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/inyear1096firstc00chaz }}\n* {{Cite book|last=Frankopan |first=Peter |title=The First Crusade: The Call from the East |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2012 | isbn=978-0-674-05994-8 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Gil |first=Moshe |authorlink=Moshe Gil |title=A History of Palestine, 634\u20131099 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-521-59984-9 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last1=Hamilton |first1=Bernard |last2=France |first2=John |last3=Zajac |first3=William G. |title=The Crusades and their Sources: Essays Presented to Bernard Hamilton |publisher=Ashgate |year=1998 |isbn=0-86078-624-2}}\n* Harris, Jonathan (2014), ''Byzantium and the Crusades'', Bloomsbury, 2nd ed. {{ISBN|978-1-78093-767-0}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Hillenbrand |first=Carole |authorlink=Carole Hillenbrand |title=The Crusades: Islamic Perspectives |publisher=Routledge |year=2000 |isbn=0-415-92914-8}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Hindley |first=Geoffrey |title=A Brief History of the Crusades: Islam and Christianity in the Struggle for World Supremacy |year=2004 |publisher=Constable & Robinson |location=London |isbn=978-1-84119-766-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/briefhistoryofcr0000hind/page/300 300] |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/briefhistoryofcr0000hind/page/300 }}\n* {{Cite book|last=Holt |first=Peter M. |title=The Age of the Crusades: The Near East from the Eleventh Century to 1517 |publisher=Longman |year=1989 |isbn=0-582-49302-1 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Hotaling |first=Edward |title=Islam Without Illusions: Its Past, Its Present, and Its Challenge for the Future |publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]] |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-8156-0766-3 |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/islamwithoutillu0000hota }}\n* {{Cite book|last=Housley |first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Housley |title=Contesting the Crusades |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location=Malden, MA |year=2006 |isbn=1-4051-1189-5}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Konstam |first=Angus |author-link=Angus Konstam |title=Historical Atlas of the Crusades |publisher=Mercury Books |year=2004 |isbn=1-904668-00-3 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Lock |first=Peter |title=Routledge Companion to the Crusades |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2006 |isbn=0-415-39312-4 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Madden |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas F.

of a number of [[religious war]]s initiated, supported and sometimes directed by the [[Latin Church]] in the [[medieval period]]. The initial objective was the recovery of the [[Holy Land]] from [[Muslim conquests|Islamic rule]]. These campaigns were subsequently given the name [[crusades]]. The first iniative for this crusade began in 1095 when the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]], [[Alexios I Komnenos]], requested military support from the [[Council of Piacenza]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]]'s conflict with the Seljuk Turks. This was followed later in that year by the Council of Clermont where Pope Urban supported this request for military assistance and also urged for an armed pilgrimage to Jerusalem. This call was met with an enthusiastic popular response across all social classes in western Europe. Mobs of predominantly poor Christians numbering in the thousands led by a [[Peter the Hermit]], a French priest, responded first. What has become known as known as the [[People's Crusade]] passed through Germany and indulged in wide-ranging [[History of the Jews in Germany|anti-Jewish]] activities and [[Rhineland massacres|massacres]]. On leaving Byzantine-controlled territory in [[Byzantine Anatolia|Anatolia]] they were annihilated in a Turkish ambush at the [[Battle of Civetot]] in October 1096.\n\nIn what has become known as the '''Princes' Crusade''' members of the high nobility and their followers embarked in late summer 1096 and arrived at [[Constantinople]] between November and April the following year. This was a feudal host led by five princes: [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]]; the [[Italo-Normans]] [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]] and his nephew [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]]; the brothers [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] and [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin]] who led forces from [[Lotharingia]] and [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]]. The army was further augmented by northern French forces under [[Robert Curthose]]; Count [[Stephen, Count of Blois]]; and [[Robert II, Count of Flanders|Robert]]. In total and including non-combatants the army could possible be estimated as numbering 100,000. The crusaders marched into Anatolia. While the [[List of Seljuk sultans of R\u00fbm|Seljuk Sultan of R\u00fbm]], [[Kilij Arslan I|Kilij Arslan]], was away resolving a dispute a Frankish [[Siege of Nicaea|siege]] and Byzantine naval assault captured [[Siege of Nicaea|captured ]] Nicea in June 1097. In marching through Anatolia, the crusaders suffered starvation, thirst and disease before gaining experience of the Turkish lightly armoured mounted archers at the [[Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)|Battle of Dorylaeum]]. Baldwin left with a small force to establish the [[County of Edessa]], the first Crusader state and [[Siege of Antioch|Antioch]] was captured in June 1098. Jerusalem was reached in June 1099 and the city was taken by [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|assault]] on 7 July 1099, massacring the defenders. A counter attack was repulsed at the [[Battle of Ascalon]]. After this the majority of the crusaders returned home.\n\nFour [[Crusader states]] were established in the [[Near East]]: the [[County of Edessa]], the [[Principality of Antioch]], the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and the [[County of Tripoli]]. The crusader presence remained in the region in some form until the city of [[Siege of Acre (1291)|Acre fell]] in 1291 leading to the rapid loss of all remaining territory in the [[Levant]]. There were no further substantive attempts to recover the Holy Land after this.\n\n==Historical context==\nThe causes of the Crusades in general, and particularly of the First Crusade, is [[#Historiographical debate|widely debated among historians]]. \nWhile the relative weight or importance of the various factors may be the subject of ongoing disputes, it is clear that the First Crusade came about from a combination of factors in both Europe and the Near East. Its origin is linked both with the political situation in Catholic Christendom, including the political and social situation in 11th-century Europe, the [[Gregorian Reform]] within the [[Pope|papacy]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Crusades and the expansion of Catholic Christendom|last=France|first=John|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|location=New York|pages=64}}</ref> as well as the military and religious confrontation of Christianity and Islam in the East.\n\nChristianity had been adopted throughout the [[Roman Empire]] in [[Late Antiquity]], but in the 7th to 8th centuries, the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] had [[Muslim conquest of Syria|conquered Syria]], [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]], and [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|North Africa]] from the predominantly Christian Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire, and [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Hispania]] from the [[Visigothic Kingdom]].<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=51\u201354}}.</ref> In North Africa, the Umayyad empire eventually collapsed and a number of smaller Muslim kingdoms emerged, such as the [[Aghlabids]], who attacked [[Italy]] in the [[Christianity in the 9th century|9th century]].

At the same time, the reform-minded papacy came into conflict with the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s, resulting in the [[Investiture Controversy]]. Popes such as [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] justified the subsequent warfare against the Emperor's partisans in theological terms. It became acceptable for the Pope to utilize knights in the name of [[Christendom]], not only against political enemies of the Papacy, but also against [[Al-Andalus]], or, theoretically, against the [[Seljuq dynasty]] in the east.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1991|pp=5\u20138}}.</ref>\n\nTo the east of Europe lay the Byzantine Empire, composed of Christians who had long followed a separate [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] rite; the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches had been [[East\u2013West Schism|in schism]] since 1054.

The Seljuq Turks had taken over almost all of Anatolia after the Byzantine defeat at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071; however, their conquests were piecemeal and led by semi-independent warlords, rather than by the sultan.

There were signs of considerable co-operation between [[Rome]] and [[Constantinople]] in the years immediately before the crusade.<ref>{{harvnb|Frankopan|2012|pp=19\u201323}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1095, Urban turned to his homeland of France to recruit men for the expedition. His travels there culminated in the ten-day [[Council of Clermont]], where on Tuesday 27 November he gave an impassioned sermon to a large audience of French nobles and clergy. There are five versions of the speech recorded by people who may have been at the council ([[Baldric of Dol]], [[Guibert of Nogent]], [[Robert the Monk]], and [[Fulcher of Chartres]]) or who went on crusade (Fulcher and the anonymous author of the [[Gesta Francorum]]), as well as other versions found in later historians (such as [[William of Malmesbury]] and William of Tyre). All of these versions were written after Jerusalem had been captured. Thus it is difficult to know what was actually said and what was recreated in the aftermath of the successful crusade. The only contemporary records are a few letters written by Urban in 1095.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=32}}.</ref>\n\nThe five versions of the speech differ widely from one another in regard to particulars, but all versions except that in the Gesta Francorum agree that Urban talked about the violence of European society and the necessity of maintaining the Peace of God; about helping the Greeks, who had asked for assistance; about the crimes being committed against Christians in the east; and about a new kind of war, an armed pilgrimage, and of rewards in heaven, where remission of sins was offered to any who might die in the undertaking.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=31\u201339}}</ref> They do not all specifically mention Jerusalem as the ultimate goal. However, it has been argued that Urban's subsequent preaching reveals that he expected the expedition to reach Jerusalem all along.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=8}}.</ref> According to one version of the speech, the enthusiastic crowd responded with cries of ''[[Deus vult]]!''

Urban had planned the departure of the first crusade for 15 August 1096, the [[Assumption of Mary|Feast of the Assumption]], but months before this, a number of unexpected armies of peasants and petty nobles set off for Jerusalem on their own, led by a charismatic priest called [[Peter the Hermit]]. Peter was the most successful of the preachers of Urban's message, and developed an almost hysterical enthusiasm among his followers, although he was probably not an \"official\" preacher sanctioned by Urban at Clermont.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=78\u201382}}.</ref> It is commonly believed that Peter's followers purely consisted of a massive group of untrained and illiterate peasants who did not even have any idea where Jerusalem was, but there were also many knights among the peasants, including [[Walter Sans Avoir]], who was lieutenant to Peter and led a separate army.<ref name=\"Riley-Smith, p. 28\">{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=28}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=82}}.</ref>\n\nLacking military discipline, in what likely seemed to the participants a strange land (Eastern Europe), Peter's fledgling army quickly found itself in trouble despite the fact they were still in Christian territory. The army led by Walter fought with the Hungarians over food at [[Belgrade]], but otherwise arrived in Constantinople unharmed. Meanwhile, the army led by Peter, which marched separately from Walter's army, also fought with the Hungarians, and may have captured Belgrade. At [[Ni\u0161|Nish]] the Byzantine governor tried to supply them, but Peter had little control over his followers and Byzantine troops were needed to quell their attacks. Peter arrived at Constantinople in August, where his army joined with the one led by Walter, which had already arrived, as well as separate bands of crusaders from France, Germany, and Italy. Another army of [[Bohemia]]ns and [[Saxony|Saxons]] did not make it past Hungary before splitting up.<ref name=\"Riley-Smith, p. 28\" />\n\nThis unruly mob began to attack and pillage outside the city in search of supplies and food, prompting Alexios to hurriedly ferry the gathering across the [[Bosphorus|Bosporus]] one week later.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|pp=26\u201327}}.</ref> After crossing into Asia Minor, the crusaders split up and began to pillage the countryside, wandering into Seljuq territory around Nicaea. The greater experience of the Turks was overwhelming; and most of this group of the crusaders were massacred because of it. Some Italian and German crusaders were defeated and killed at Xerigordon at the end of August. Meanwhile, Walter and Peter's followers, who, although for the most part untrained in battle but led by about 50&nbsp;knights, fought a battle against the Turks [[Battle of Civetot|at Civetot]] in October. The Turkish archers destroyed the crusader army, and Walter was among the dead. Peter, who was absent in Constantinople at the time, later joined the main crusader army, along with the few survivors of Civetot.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=101\u2013103}}.</ref>\n\nAt a local level, the preaching of the First Crusade ignited the [[Rhineland massacres]] perpetrated against Jews, which some historians have deemed \"the first [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1991|p=50}}.</ref> At the end of 1095 and beginning of 1096, months before the departure of the official crusade in August, there were attacks on Jewish communities in France and Germany. In May 1096, [[Emicho|Emicho of Flonheim]] (sometimes incorrectly known as Emicho of Leiningen) attacked the Jews at Speyer and Worms. Other unofficial crusaders from Swabia, led by Hartmann of Dillingen, along with French, English, Lotharingian and Flemish volunteers, led by Drogo of Nesle and [[William the Carpenter]], as well as many locals, joined Emicho in the destruction of the Jewish community of Mainz at the end of May.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=84\u201385}}.</ref> In Mainz, one Jewish woman killed her children rather than see them killed; the chief rabbi, [[Kalonymus Ben Meshullam]], committed suicide in anticipation of being killed.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=102}}.</ref>\nEmicho's company then went on to Cologne, and others continued on to Trier, Metz, and other cities.<ref name=\"Tyerman, p. 103\">{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=103}}.</ref> Peter the Hermit may have been involved in violence against the Jews, and an army led by a priest named Folkmar also attacked Jews further east in Bohemia.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=24}}.</ref> Emicho's army eventually continued into Hungary but was defeated by the army of [[Coloman, King of Hungary|Coloman of Hungary]]. His followers dispersed; some eventually joined the main armies, although Emicho himself went home.<ref name=\"Tyerman, p. 103\" />\nMany of the attackers seem to have wanted to force the Jews to convert, although they were also interested in acquiring money from them. Physical violence against Jews was never part of the church hierarchy's official policy for crusading, and the Christian bishops, especially the Archbishop of Cologne, did their best to protect the Jews. A decade before, the Bishop of Speyer had taken the step of providing the Jews of that city with a walled ghetto to protect them from Christian violence and given their chief Rabbis the control of judicial matters in the quarter. Nevertheless, some also took money in return for their protection. The attacks may have originated in the belief that Jews and Muslims were equally enemies of Christ, and enemies were to be fought or converted to Christianity. Godfrey of Bouillon was rumoured to have extorted money from the Jews of Cologne and Mainz, and many of the Crusaders wondered why they should travel thousands of miles to fight non-believers when there were already non-believers closer to home.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=103\u2013106}}.</ref> \n\n==Princes' Crusade==\n{{anchor|Princes' Crusade}}\n[[File:First.Crusade.Map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Routes of the leaders of the First Crusade]]\n\nThe four main crusader armies left Europe around the appointed time in August 1096. They took different paths to Constantinople and gathered outside its [[Walls of Constantinople|city walls]] between November 1096 and April 1097; Hugh of Vermandois arrived first, followed by Godfrey, Raymond, and Bohemond. This time, Emperor Alexios was more prepared for the crusaders; there were fewer incidents of violence along the way.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=103\u2013105}}.</ref> It is impossible to estimate the numbers involved. Some historians put a figure of 70,000 to 80,000 on the number who left Western Europe in the year after Clermont, and more joined in the three year duration.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=75}} Estimates for the number of Knights range from 7,000 to 10,000; 35,000 to 50,000 foot soldiers; and including non-combatants a total of 60,000 to 100,000.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=42}}\n\n===Recruitment===\n{{see|Christian Forces of the First Crusades|Army of Godfrey of Bouillon|Army of Hugh the Great|Army of Robert Curthose|Armies of Bohemond of Taranto}}\nUrban's speech had been well-planned: he had discussed the crusade with [[Adhemar of Le Puy]] and [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]], and instantly the expedition had the support of two of southern France's most important leaders. Adhemar himself was present at the Council and was the first to \"take the cross\". During the rest of 1095 and into 1096, Urban spread the message throughout France, and urged his bishops and legates to preach in their own dioceses elsewhere in France, Germany, and Italy as well. However, it is clear that the response to the speech was much greater than even the Pope, let alone Alexios, expected. On his tour of France, Urban tried to forbid certain people (including women, monks, and the sick) from joining the crusade, but found this nearly impossible. In the end, most who took up the call were not knights, but peasants who were not wealthy and had little in the way of fighting skills, in an outpouring of a new emotional and personal piety that was not easily harnessed by the ecclesiastical and lay aristocracy.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=46\u201349}}.</ref> Typically, preaching would conclude with every volunteer taking a vow to complete a pilgrimage to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre; they were also given a cross, usually sewn onto their clothes.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=65\u201366}}.</ref>\n\nAs Thomas Asbridge wrote, \"Just as we can do nothing more than estimate the number of thousands who responded to the crusading ideal, so too, with the surviving evidence, we can gain only a limited insight into their motivation and intent.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=41}}.</ref> Previous generations of scholars argued that the crusaders were motivated by greed, hoping to find a better life away from the famines and warfare occurring in France, but as Asbridge notes, \"This image is ... profoundly misleading.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=68}}.</ref> He argues that greed was unlikely to have been a major factor because of the extremely high cost of travelling so far from home, and because almost all of the crusaders eventually returned home after completing their pilgrimage rather than trying to carve out possessions for themselves in the Holy Land.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=69}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1998|p=15}}.</ref> It is difficult or impossible to assess the motives of the thousands of poor for whom there is no historical record, or even those of important knights, whose stories were usually retold by monks or clerics. As the secular medieval world was so deeply ingrained with the spiritual world of the church, it is quite likely that personal piety was a major factor for many crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=69\u201371}}.</ref>\n\nDespite this popular enthusiasm, however, Urban ensured that there would be an army of knights, drawn from the French aristocracy. Aside from Adhemar and Raymond, other leaders he recruited throughout 1096 included [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]], a southern Italian ally of the reform popes; Bohemond's nephew [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]]; [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], who had previously been an anti-reform ally of the Holy Roman Emperor; his brother [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin of Boulogne]]; [[Hugh I, Count of Vermandois]], brother of the excommunicated [[Philip I of France]]; [[Robert Curthose]], brother of [[William II of England]]; and his relatives [[Stephen II, Count of Blois]] and [[Robert II, Count of Flanders]]. The crusaders represented northern and southern France, Flanders, Germany, and southern Italy, and so were divided into four separate armies that were not always cooperative, though they were held together by their common ultimate goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=55\u201365}}.</ref>\n\nThe motives of the nobility are somewhat clearer than those of the peasants; greed was apparently not a major factor. Runciman (1951) assumed that only younger members of a family went on crusade, looking for wealth and adventure elsewhere, as they had no prospects for advancement at home. Riley-Smith (1998) has shown that this was not always the case. The crusade was led by some of the most powerful nobles of France, who left everything behind, and it was often the case that entire families went on crusade at their own great expense.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1998|p=21}}.</ref> \nFor example, Robert of Normandy loaned the [[Duchy of Normandy]] to his brother William II of England, and Godfrey sold or mortgaged his property to the church.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=77}}.</ref> According to Tancred's biographer, he was worried about the sinful nature of knightly warfare, and was excited to find a holy outlet for violence.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=71}}.</ref> Tancred and Bohemond, as well as Godfrey, Baldwin, and their older brother [[Eustace III, Count of Boulogne]], are examples of families who crusaded together. Riley-Smith argues that the enthusiasm for the crusade was perhaps based on family relations, as most of the French crusaders were distant relatives.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1998|pp=93\u201397}}.</ref> Nevertheless, in at least some cases, personal advancement played a role in Crusaders' motives. For instance, Bohemond was motivated by the desire to carve himself out a territory in the east, and had previously campaigned against the Byzantines to try to achieve this. The Crusade gave him a further opportunity, which he took after the [[Siege of Antioch]], taking possession of the city and establishing the Principality of Antioch.<ref name=\"Neveux186\">{{harvnb|Neveux|2008|pp=186\u2013188}}.</ref>\n\nThe size of the entire crusader army is difficult to estimate; various numbers were given by the eyewitnesses, and equally various estimates have been offered by modern historians. Crusader military historian [[David Nicolle]] considers the armies to have consisted of about 30,000\u201335,000 crusaders, including 5,000 [[cavalry]]. Raymond had the largest contingent of about 8,500 [[infantry]] and 1,200 cavalry.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolle|2003|pp=21, 32}}.</ref>\n\nThe princes arrived in Constantinople with little food and expected provisions and help from Alexios. Alexios was understandably suspicious after his experiences with the People's Crusade, and also because the knights included his old Norman enemy, Bohemond, who had invaded Byzantine territory on numerous occasions with his father, [[Robert Guiscard]], and may have even attempted to organize an attack on Constantinople while encamped outside the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=106}}.</ref>\n\nThe crusaders may have expected Alexios to become their leader, but he had no interest in joining them, and was mainly concerned with transporting them into Asia Minor as quickly as possible.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=110}}.</ref> In return for food and supplies, Alexios requested the leaders to swear [[fealty]] to him and promise to return to the Byzantine Empire any land recovered from the Turks. Godfrey was the first to take the oath, and almost all the other leaders followed him, although they did so only after warfare had almost broken out in the city between the citizens and the crusaders, who were eager to pillage for supplies. Raymond alone avoided swearing the oath, instead pledging that he would simply cause no harm to the Empire. Before ensuring that the various armies were shuttled across the Bosporus, Alexios advised the leaders on how best to deal with the Seljuq armies that they would soon encounter.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=110\u2013113}}.</ref>\n\n===Siege of Nicaea===\n{{Main|Siege of Nicaea}}\n\nThe Crusader armies crossed over into Asia Minor during the first half of 1097, where they were joined by Peter the Hermit and the remainder of his relatively small army. In addition, Alexios also sent two of his own generals, [[Manuel Boutoumites]] and [[Tatikios]], to assist the crusaders. The first objective of their campaign was [[Nicaea]], previously a city under Byzantine rule, but which had become the capital of the Seljuq [[Sultanate of Rum]] under [[Kilij Arslan I]]. Arslan was away campaigning against the [[Danishmends]] in central Anatolia at the time, and had left behind his treasury and his family, underestimating the strength of these new crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=117\u2013120}}.</ref>\n\nSubsequently, upon the Crusaders' arrival, the city was subjected to a lengthy siege, and when Arslan had word of it he rushed back to Nicaea and attacked the crusader army on 16 May. He was driven back by the unexpectedly large crusader force, with heavy losses being suffered on both sides in the ensuing battle.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=124\u2013126}}.</ref> The siege continued, but the crusaders had little success as they found they could not blockade [[Lake \u0130znik|the lake]], which the city was situated on, and from which it could be provisioned.  To break the city, Alexios sent the Crusaders' ships rolled over land on logs, and at the sight of them the Turkish garrison finally surrendered on 18 June.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=126\u2013130}}.</ref> \n\nThere was some discontent amongst the Franks who were forbidden from looting the city. This was ameliorated by Alexius financially rewarding the crusaders. Later chronicles exagerate tension between the Greeks and Franks but Stephen of Blois, in a letter to his wife [[Adela of Normandy|Adela of Blois]]  confirms goodwill and cooperation continued at this point.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=55}} As Thomas Asbridge writes, \"the fall of Nicaea was a product of the successful policy of close co-operation between the crusaders and Byzantium.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=130}}.</ref> \n\n===Battle of Dorylaeum===\n{{Main|Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)}}\n\n[[File:Baldwin of Boulogne entering Edessa in Feb 1098.JPG|thumb|230px|right|[[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin of Boulogne]] entering [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] in 1098 ([[history painting]], [[Joseph-Nicolas Robert-Fleury]] 1840)]]\n\nAt the end of June, the crusaders marched on through Anatolia. They were accompanied by some Byzantine troops under Tatikios, and still harboured the hope that Alexios would send a full Byzantine army after them. They also divided the army into two more-easily managed groups\u2014one contingent led by the Normans, the other by the French.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=132\u201334}}.</ref> The two groups intended to meet again at [[Dorylaeum]], but on 1 July the Normans, who had marched ahead of the French, were attacked by Kilij Arslan. Arslan had gathered a much larger army than he previously had after his defeat at Nicaea, and now surrounded the Normans with his fast-moving mounted archers. The Normans \"deployed in a tight-knit defensive formation\",<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=135}}.</ref> surrounding all their equipment and the non-combatants who had followed them along the journey, and sent for help from the other group. When the French arrived, Godfrey broke through the Turkish lines and the legate Adhemar outflanked the Turks from the rear; thus the Turks, who had expected to destroy the Normans and did not anticipate the quick arrival of the French, fled rather than face the combined crusader army.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=135\u201337}}.</ref>\n\nThe crusaders' march through Anatolia was thereafter unopposed, but the journey was unpleasant, as Arslan had burned and destroyed everything he left behind in his army's flight. It was the middle of summer, and the crusaders had very little food and water; many men and horses died.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=138\u201339}}.</ref> Fellow Christians sometimes gave them gifts of food and money, but more often than not, the crusaders simply looted and pillaged whenever the opportunity presented itself. Individual leaders continued to dispute the overall leadership, although none of them were powerful enough to take command on their own, as Adhemar was always recognized as the spiritual leader. After passing through the [[Cilician Gates]], Baldwin of Boulogne set off on his own towards the Armenian lands around the [[Euphrates]]; his wife, his only claim to European lands and wealth, had died after the battle, giving Baldwin no incentive to return to Europe. Thus, he resolved to seize a fiefdom for himself in the Holy Land. Early in 1098, he was adopted as heir by [[Thoros of Edessa]], a ruler who was disliked by his Armenian subjects for his [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] religion. Thoros was later killed, during an uprising that Baldwin may have instigated.<ref name=\"Hindley37\">{{harvnb|Hindley|2004|p=37}}.</ref> Then, in March 1098, Baldwin became the new ruler, thus creating the [[County of Edessa]], the first of the crusader states.<ref name=\"Hindley37\" /><ref name=\"Runciman149\">{{harvnb|Runciman|1980|p=149}}.</ref>\n\n===Siege of Antioch===\n{{Main|Siege of Antioch|Ya\u011f\u0131s\u0131yan}}\n{{See also|Tafurs}}\n\n[[File:Gustave dore crusades bohemond alone mounts the rampart of antioch.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]] Alone Mounts the Rampart of [[Antioch]]'' by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] (1871)|alt=Bohemond of Taranto is illuminated in the engraving as he is shown being the only one climbing the rampart of Antioch.

Described by Stephen of Blois as \"a city great beyond belief, very strong and unassailable\", the idea of taking the city by assault was a discouraging one to the crusaders.<ref name=\"Hindley28\">{{harvnb|Hindley|2004|p=38}}.</ref> Hoping rather to force a capitulation, or find a traitor inside the city\u2014a tactic that had previously seen Antioch change to the control of the Byzantines and then the Seljuq Turks\u2014the crusader army set Antioch to siege on 20 October 1097.<ref name=\"Hindley39\">{{harvnb|Hindley|2004|p=39}}</ref> Antioch was so large that the crusaders did not have enough troops to fully surround it, and as a result it was able to stay partially supplied.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=135}}.</ref> \n\nBy January the attritional eight month siege led to hundreds, or possibly thousands, of crusaders dieing of starvation. Adhemar considered this was caused by their sinful nature; woman were expelled from the camp, fasting, prayer, almsgiving and procession undertaken. Many, such as Stephen of Blois,  deserted. Foraging systems eased the situation, as did supplies from Cicilia, Edessa, through the recently captured ports of [[Latakia]] and [[Port Saint Symeon]] and in March  a small English fleet.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=68\u201369}} The Franks benefited from disunity in the Muslim world and the possible misunderstanding that they were thought to be Byzantine merceneries. The Seljuk brothers,[[Duqaq]] of Syria and [[Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan]] of Aleppo dispatched separate relief armies in December and Febuary that if they had been combined would probably have been victorious.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=71}} In response to these failures the [[Atabeg]] of [[Mosul]] raised a coalition from southern Syria, nothern Iraq and Anatolia with the ambition of extending his power from Syria to the Mediterranean sea. Bohemond persuaded that other leaders that in Antioch fell he would keep it for himself and that an Armenian commander of a section of the cities walls had agreed to enable the crusaders to enter. Stephen of Blois had been his only competitor and while deserting his message to Alexius that the cause was lost persuaded the Emperor to halt his advance through Anatolia at [[Philomelium]] before returning to Constantinople. Alexius failure to reach the seige was used by Bohemond to rationalise his refusal to return the city to the Empire as promised.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=87\u201388}} The Armenian, [[Firouz]], helped Bohemond and a small party enter the city on the 2nd June and open a gate at which point horns were sounded, the city's Christian majority opened the other gates and the crusaders entered. In the sack they killed most of the Muslim inhabitants and many Christian Greeks, Syrians and Armenians in the confusion.\n\nOn 4 June the vanguard of Kerbogha's 40,000 strong army arrived surrounding the Franks. From the 10 Junes for 4 days waves of Kerbogha's men assailed the city walls from dawn until dusk. Bohemond and Adhemar barred the city gates to prevent mass desertions and managed to hold out. Kerbogha then changed tactics to trying to starve the crusaders out. Morale inside the city was low and defeat looked imminent but a peasant visionary called [[Peter Bartholomew]] claimed the apostle [[St Andrew]] came to him to show the location of the [[Holy Lance]] that had pierced Christ on the cross. This supposedly encouraged the crusaders but the accounts are misleading as it was two weeks before the final battle for the city. On the 24 June the Franks sought terms for surrender that were refused. On 28 June 1098 at dawn the Franks marched out of the city in four battle groups to engage the enemy. Kerbogha allowed them to deploy with the aim of destroying them in the open. However the discipline of the Muslim army did not hold and a disorderly attack was launched. Unable to overrun a bedraggled force they outnumbered two to one Muslims attacking the Bridge Gate fled through the advancing main body of the Muslim army. With very few casualities the Muslim army broke and fled the battle.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=74\u201382}} \n\nStephen of Blois, a Crusade leader, was in [[Alexandretta]] when he learned of the situation in Antioch. It seemed like their situation was hopeless so he left the Middle East, warning Alexios and his army on his way back to France.<ref>Madden 2006, 28</ref> Because of what looked like a massive betrayal, the leaders at Antioch, most notably Bohemond, argued that Alexios had deserted the Crusade and thus invalidated all of their oaths to him. While Bohemond asserted his claim to Antioch, not everyone agreed (most notably Raymond of Toulouse), so the crusade was delayed for the rest of the year while the nobles argued amongst themselves. When discussing this period, a common historiographical viewpoint advanced by some scholars is that the [[Franks]] of northern France, the [[Provence|Proven\u00e7als]] of southern France, and the [[Normans]] of southern Italy considered themselves separate \"nations\", creating turmoil as each tried to increase its individual status. Others argue that while this may have had something to do with the disputes, personal ambition among the Crusader leaders might just be as easily blamed.<ref name=\"Neveux186\" />\n\nMeanwhile, a plague broke out, killing many among the army, including the legate Adhemar, who died on 1 August.<ref name=\"Lock23\">{{harvnb|Lock|2006|p=23}}.</ref> There were now even fewer horses than before, and worse, the Muslim peasants in the area refused to supply the crusaders with food. Thus, in December, after the Arab town of [[Ma'arrat al-Numan]] was captured following [[Siege of Ma'arrat al-Numan|a siege]], history describes the first occurrence of [[cannibalism]] among the crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Runciman|1951|p=261}}.</ref> Radulph of Caen wrote, \"In Ma'arrat our troops boiled pagan adults in cooking pots; they impaled children on spits and devoured them grilled.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Hotaling|2003|p=114}}</ref> At the same time, the minor knights and soldiers had become increasingly restless and threatened to continue to Jerusalem without their squabbling leaders.

Here there was no prospect of relief, even as they feared an imminent attack by the local Fatimid rulers. There was no hope of trying to blockade the city as they had at Antioch; the crusaders had insufficient troops, supplies, and time. Rather, they resolved to take the city by assault.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" /> They might have been left with little choice, as by the time the Crusader army reached Jerusalem, it has been estimated that only about 12,000 men including 1,500 cavalry remained.<ref name=\"crusadearmy\">{{harvnb|Konstam|2004|p=133}}.</ref> These contingents, composed of men with differing origins and varying allegiances, were also approaching another low ebb in their camaraderie; e.g., while Godfrey and Tancred made camp to the north of the city, Raymond made his to the south. In addition, the Proven\u00e7al contingent did not take part in the initial assault on 13 June. This first assault was perhaps more speculative than determined, and after scaling the outer wall the Crusaders were repulsed from the inner one.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" />\n\nAfter the failure of the initial assault, a meeting between the various leaders was organized in which it was agreed upon that a more concerted attack would be required in the future. On 17 June, a party of Genoese mariners under [[Guglielmo Embriaco]] arrived at [[Jaffa]], and provided the Crusaders with skilled engineers, and perhaps more critically, supplies of timber (stripped from the ships) to build [[siege engine]]s.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" /> The Crusaders' morale was raised when a priest, Peter Desiderius, claimed to have had a divine vision, of Bishop Adhemar, instructing them to fast and then march in a barefoot procession around the city walls, after which the city would fall, following the Biblical story of [[Joshua]] at the siege of [[Tell es-Sultan|Jericho]].<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" /> After a three-day fast, on 8 July the crusaders performed the procession as they had been instructed by Desiderius, ending on the Mount of Olives where Peter the Hermit preached to them,<ref>Runciman284</ref> and shortly afterward the various bickering factions arrived at a public rapprochement. News arrived shortly after that a Fatimid relief army had set off from Egypt, giving the Crusaders a very strong incentive to make another assault on the city.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" />\n\nThe final assault on Jerusalem began on 13 July; Raymond's troops attacked the south gate while the other contingents attacked the northern wall. Initially the Proven\u00e7als at the southern gate made little headway, but the contingents at the northern wall fared better, with a slow but steady attrition of the defence. On 15 July, a final push was launched at both ends of the city, and eventually the inner rampart of the northern wall was captured. In the ensuing panic, the defenders abandoned the walls of the city at both ends, allowing the Crusaders to finally enter.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\">{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=157\u2013159}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1099 Siege of Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|Siege of Jerusalem]] as depicted in a medieval manuscript]]\nThe massacre that followed the capture of Jerusalem has attained particular notoriety, as a \"juxtaposition of extreme violence and anguished faith\".<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=159}}.</ref> The eyewitness accounts from the crusaders themselves leave little doubt that there was great slaughter in the aftermath of the siege. Nevertheless, some historians propose that the scale of the massacre has been exaggerated in later medieval sources.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Madden|2005|p=34}}</ref>\n\nAfter the successful assault on the northern wall, the defenders fled to the [[Temple Mount]], pursued by Tancred and his men. Arriving before the defenders could secure the area, Tancred's men assaulted the precinct, butchering many of the defenders, with the remainder taking refuge in the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]]. Tancred then called a halt to the slaughter, offering those in the mosque his protection.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" /> When the defenders on the southern wall heard of the fall of the northern wall, they fled to the citadel, allowing Raymond and the Proven\u00e7als to enter the city. [[Iftikhar al-Dawla]], the commander of the garrison, struck a deal with Raymond, surrendering the citadel in return for being granted safe passage to [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]].<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" />\n\nThe slaughter continued for the rest of the day; Muslims were indiscriminately killed, and Jews who had taken refuge in their synagogue died when it was burnt down by the Crusaders. The following day, Tancred's prisoners in the mosque were slaughtered. Nevertheless, it is clear that some Muslims and Jews of the city survived the massacre, either escaping or being taken prisoner to be ransomed.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" /> The Eastern Christian population of the city had been expelled before the siege by the governor, and thus escaped the massacre.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" />\n\n===Establishment of the Kingdom of Jerusalem===\n[[File:Crusader Graffiti in the Church of the holy supulchure Jerusalem Victor 2011 -1-21.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Crusader graffiti in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], [[Jerusalem]]]]\n\nOn 22 July, a council was held in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] to establish governance for Jerusalem. The death of the Greek Patriach meant there was no obvious candidate to establish an ecclesiastical realm the clergy contended. Raymond of Toulouse's support had waned since Arqa so Godfrey accepted the title [[Defender of the Holy Sepulchre]] and took secular power. Raymond was incensed at this development, attempted to seize the [[Tower of David]] before leaving the city.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=42}} The exact nature and meaning of Godfrey's title is somewhat controversial. Although it is widely claimed that he took the title ''Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri'' (\"advocate\" or \"defender\" of the Holy Sepulchre), this title is only used in a letter that was not written by Godfrey. Instead, Godfrey himself seems to have used the more ambiguous term ''princeps'', or simply retained his title of ''dux'' from Lower Lorraine. According to William of Tyre, writing in the later 12th century when Godfrey was already a legendary hero in crusader Jerusalem, he refused to wear \"a crown of gold\" where Christ had worn \"a crown of thorns\".<ref>William of Tyre, [http://thelatinlibrary.com/williamtyre/9.html#9 Book 9, Chapter 9].</ref> [[Robert the Monk]] is the only contemporary chronicler of the crusade to report that Godfrey took the title \"king\".<ref>Riley-Smith (1979), \"The Title of Godfrey of Bouillon\", ''Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research'' '''52''', pp. 83\u201386.</ref><ref>Murray, Alan V.

Outnumbered two to one the Franks launched a surprise dawn attack and routed the over confident and unprepared Muslim force. The opportunity was wasted though, as squabling between Raymond and Godfrey prevented an attempt by the city's garrison to surrender to the more trusted Raymond.

The life of Godfrey of Bouillon became legendary even within a few years of his death.<ref>{{harvnb|Baldwin|1969|pp=379\u2013380}}.</ref> In some cases, the political situation at home was greatly affected by crusader absences.

In the wake of the death of Malik Shah I in 1092, political instability and the division of the [[Great Seljuq Empire]] prevented a coherent defence against the Latin states.

Some of these, such as the [[Chanson d'Antioche]], are semi-historical, while others are completely fanciful, describing battles with a dragon or connecting Godfrey's ancestors to the legend of the [[Knight of the Swan]].

Following the [[Battle of Manzikert|defeat]] at [[Malazgirt|Manzikert]] in 1071, Muslims had taken half of the Byzantine Empire's territory, and such strategically and religiously important cities as Antioch and Nicaea had only fallen to Muslims in the decade before the [[Council of Piacenza]].<ref name=\"treadgold\" /> Moreover, the harrowing accounts of the atrocities committed by the invaders against the Anatolian population recorded by Eastern Christian chroniclers such as [[John Skylitzes]], [[Michael Attaleiates]], [[Matthew of Edessa]], Michael the Syrian and others (summarized Vryonis 1971) align with the primary motivation of relieving the acute distress suffered by the Byzantine empire.\nIn addition, the early 11th century saw a worsening of Muslim-Christian relations in the Levant; for example, in 1009 the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] had been [[Destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre 1009|destroyed]] by the Fatimid Caliph [[al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]]; [[Pope Sergius IV]] had supposedly already called for a military expedition in response to this.<ref>\nThe bull attributed to Sergius was considered genuine by Erdmann (1935), but its authenticity was later called into question.

A theory proposed by [[Carl Erdmann]] (1935), known as the \"Erdmann thesis\", links the First Crusade l to the [[Gregorian Reform]], the series of reforms initiated by [[Pope Gregory VII]] during c. 1050\u201380. These reforms re-established the [[Western Christianity|Western Church]], which had been [[Saeculum obscurum|much weakened]] during the 10th century, as a relevant power able to inspire and co-ordinate the crusades.<ref>Erdmann (1935), ''Die Entstehung des Kreuzzugsgedankens''. Translated into English as ''The Origin of the Idea of Crusade'' by Marshall W. Baldwin and Walter Goffart in 1977.</ref> \nThe \"Erdmann thesis\" proposes that the strengthened Western Church, combined with the weakened Byzantine Empire, permitted a projection of power from west to east, with the actual conquest of Jerusalem figuring at best as a secondary, popular goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1991|p=1}}.</ref>\n\nWhile it is clear that the motivations for and causes of the First Crusade are to be sought both in the East and in the West, there has still been much debate among historiographers of the later 20th century on how the relative impact of such causes should be weighed.\n\nThe very influential [[Steven Runciman]] (1951) significantly shaped the popular perception of the crusades in the later 20th century. Runciman represents the view that the motivation for the crusades was primarily that of a \"barbarian invasion\" motivated by greed and the desire for spoils and adventure among the Frankish nobles.<ref>Riddle (2008) says that for his day Runciman was the \"greatest historian of the Crusades.\" He reports that, \"Prior to Runciman, in the early part of the [20th] century, historians related the Crusades as an idealistic attempt of Christendom to push Islam back.\" Runciman regarded the Crusades \"as a barbarian invasion of a superior civilization, not that of the Muslims but of the Byzantines.\" {{cite book|author=John M Riddle|title=A History of the Middle Ages, 300\u20131500|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rhWpPr93KjMC&pg=PA315|year=2008|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishing Group, Incorporated|page=315|isbn=9780742554092}}. Madden (2005) stresses the impact of Runciman's style and viewpoint: as having \"single-handedly crafted the current popular concept of the crusades\" by painting the crusaders as \"simpletons or barbarians\". {{cite book|author=Thomas F Madden|title=The New Concise History of the Crusades|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fKYxKsgVpmMC&pg=PA216|year=2005|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|page=216|isbn=9780742538221}}</ref> Runciman argued that the crusade was motivated by a combination of theological justification for holy war and a \"general restlessness and taste for adventure\", especially among the Normans and the \"younger sons\" of the French nobility who had no other opportunities.<ref>{{harvnb|Runciman|1980|p=76}}.</ref> and goes as far as suggesting that there wasn't any immediate threat from the Islamic world, arguing that \"in the middle of the 11th century the lot of the Christians in Palestine had seldom been so pleasant\".<ref>{{harvnb|Runciman|1980|p=31}}.</ref> \n\nIn a similar vein, [[Thomas Asbridge]] (2004) argues that the First Crusade was a strategic attempt to expand the power of the Western Church, and reunite the churches of Rome and Constantinople, which had been in [[East\u2013West Schism|schism since 1054]]. According to this view, the Islamic conquests were of little importance in this, as \"Islam and Christendom had coexisted for centuries in relative equanimity\".<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=17}}; for Urban's personal motives, see pp.&nbsp;19\u201321.</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, historians of the second half of the 20th century, such as [[Speros Vryonis]] (1971), have emphasized the importance of the military threat of Islamic expansion and the atrocities and attacks against Christians in Anatolia and the Levant.<ref name=\"Vryonis\">{{harvnb|Vryonis|1971|pp=85\u2013117}}.</ref>\nSimilarly, [[Moshe Gil]] (1997) argues against Runciman on the basis of contemporary Jewish [[Cairo Geniza]] documents, as well as later Muslim accounts, concluding that the Seljuq invasion of Anatolia and the occupation of Palestine (c.&nbsp;1073\u20131098) was a period of \"slaughter and vandalism, of economic hardship, and the uprooting of populations\".<ref>{{harvnb|Gil|1997|p=420}}; for details on the Seljuq occupation of Palestine, see pp.&nbsp;410\u2013420.</ref> Indeed, drawing upon earlier writers such as Ignatius of Melitene, [[Michael the Syrian]] had recorded that the Seljuqs subjected Coele-Syria and the Palestinian coast to \"cruel destruction and pillage\".<ref>''Chronique de Michel le Syrien'', pp.&nbsp;170\u2013171.</ref>\n\n[[Thomas F. Madden]] (2005) represents a view almost diametrically opposed to that of Asbridge (2004); while the crusade was certainly linked to church reform and attempts to assert papal authority, he argues that it was most importantly a pious struggle to liberate fellow Christians, who, Madden claims, \"had suffered mightily at the hands of the Turks\". This argument distinguishes the relatively recent violence and warfare that followed the conquests of the Turks from the general advance of Islam in the early medieval period, the significance of which had been dismissed by Runciman and Asbridge.<ref>{{harvnb|Madden|2005|p=7}}.</ref>\n \n[[Christopher Tyerman]] (2006) attempted a resolution by arguing for compound causes, presenting the First Crusade as developing out of the Western church reform and theories of holy war as much as being a response to conflicts with the Islamic world throughout Europe and the Middle East.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=56\u201357}}.</ref>\n\nIn the view of [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]] (2005), additional contingencies such as poor harvests, overpopulation, and a pre-existing movement towards colonizing the frontier areas of Europe have also contributed to the crusade; however, he also takes care to say that \"most commentators then and a minority of historians now have maintained that the chief motivation was a genuine idealism\".<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=17}}.</ref>\n\n[[Peter Frankopan]] (2012) has argued that the First Crusade has been fundamentally distorted by the attention paid by historians to western (Latin) sources, rather than Greek, Syriac, Armenian, Arabic and Hebrew material from the late 11th and 12th centuries. The expedition to Jerusalem, he argues, was conceived of not by the Pope but by the Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]], in response to a dramatic deterioration of Byzantium's position in Asia Minor and also as a result of a state of near anarchy at the imperial court where plans to depose Alexios or even murder him were an open secret by 1094. \nThe appeal to Pope [[Urban II]] was a desperate move to shore up Emperor and Empire. Frankopan\nfurther argues that the primary military targets of the First Crusade in Asia Minor \u2014 [[Nicaea]] and [[Antioch]] \u2014 required large numbers of soldiers with experience in siege warfare, precisely the type of force recruited by Urban in France in his call to arms of 1095/6.<ref>{{harvnb|Frankopan|2012|pp=87\u2013101}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Commons category|First Crusade}}\n\n* [[Christian Forces of the First Crusades]]\n** [[The Crusader Army of Godfrey of Bouillon]]\n** [[The Crusader Army of Hugh the Great]]\n** [[Army of Robert Curthose on the First Crusade|The Crusader Army of Robert Curthose]]\n* [[Second Crusade]]\n* [[Battle of Civetot]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Asbridge |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Asbridge |title=The First Crusade: A New History |publisher=Oxford |year=2004 |isbn=0-19-517823-8 |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/firstcrusadenewh00asbr }}\n* {{cite book|last=Asbridge|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Asbridge|title=The Crusades: The War for the Holy Land|year=2012|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|isbn=978-1-84983-688-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rK8nA9U0OE4C&dq=thomas+asbridge+the+crusades&source=gbs_navlinks_s|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Baldwin |first=Marshall W. |title=A History of the Crusades: The First Hundred Years |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |location=Madison, Wisconsin |year=1969 |url=http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/History.CrusOne |isbn=978-0-299-04834-1 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Bartlett |first=Robert |author-link=Robert Bartlett (historian) |title=The Making of Europe: Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change 950\u20131350 |publisher=Princeton |year=1994 |isbn=0-691-03780-9}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Chazan |first=Robert |title=In the Year 1096: The First Crusade and the Jews |publisher=Jewish Publication Society |year=1997 |isbn=0-8276-0575-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/inyear1096firstc00chaz }}\n* {{Cite book|last=Frankopan |first=Peter |title=The First Crusade: The Call from the East |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2012 | isbn=978-0-674-05994-8 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Gil |first=Moshe |authorlink=Moshe Gil |title=A History of Palestine, 634\u20131099 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-521-59984-9 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last1=Hamilton |first1=Bernard |last2=France |first2=John |last3=Zajac |first3=William G. |title=The Crusades and their Sources: Essays Presented to Bernard Hamilton |publisher=Ashgate |year=1998 |isbn=0-86078-624-2}}\n* Harris, Jonathan (2014), ''Byzantium and the Crusades'', Bloomsbury, 2nd ed. {{ISBN|978-1-78093-767-0}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Hillenbrand |first=Carole |authorlink=Carole Hillenbrand |title=The Crusades: Islamic Perspectives |publisher=Routledge |year=2000 |isbn=0-415-92914-8}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Hindley |first=Geoffrey |title=A Brief History of the Crusades: Islam and Christianity in the Struggle for World Supremacy |year=2004 |publisher=Constable & Robinson |location=London |isbn=978-1-84119-766-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/briefhistoryofcr0000hind/page/300 300] |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/briefhistoryofcr0000hind/page/300 }}\n* {{Cite book|last=Holt |first=Peter M. |title=The Age of the Crusades: The Near East from the Eleventh Century to 1517 |publisher=Longman |year=1989 |isbn=0-582-49302-1 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Hotaling |first=Edward |title=Islam Without Illusions: Its Past, Its Present, and Its Challenge for the Future |publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]] |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-8156-0766-3 |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/islamwithoutillu0000hota }}\n* {{Cite book|last=Housley |first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Housley |title=Contesting the Crusades |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location=Malden, MA |year=2006 |isbn=1-4051-1189-5}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Konstam |first=Angus |author-link=Angus Konstam |title=Historical Atlas of the Crusades |publisher=Mercury Books |year=2004 |isbn=1-904668-00-3 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Lock |first=Peter |title=Routledge Companion to the Crusades |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2006 |isbn=0-415-39312-4 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Madden |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas F.
