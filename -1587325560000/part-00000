When reaching the age of 7, they learn how to ride and hunt; at age 14, they are looked after by four teachers of aristocratic stock, who teach them how to be \"wise, just, prudent and brave.\"{{sfn|Stoneman|2015|p=27}} Persian princes were also taught on the basics of the [[Zoroastrian]] religion, to be truthful, have self-restraint, and to be courageous.{{sfn|Stoneman|2015|p=27}} The dialogue further adds that \"Fear, for a Persian, is the equivalent of slavery.\"{{sfn|Stoneman|2015|p=27}} At the age of 16 or 17, they begin their \"national service\" for 10 years, which included practicing archery and javelin, competing for prizes, and hunting.{{sfn|Stoneman|2015|p=28}} Afterwards they serve in the military for around 25 years, and are then elevated to the status of elders and advisers of the king.{{sfn|Stoneman|2015|p=28}} \n\nThis account of education amongst the Persian elite is supported by [[Xenophon]]'s description of the 5th-century BC Achaemenid prince [[Cyrus the Younger]], whom he was well-acquainted with.{{sfn|Stoneman|2015|p=28}} Stoneman suggests that this was the type of upbringing and education that Xerxes experienced.{{sfn|Stoneman|2015|p=29}} It is unknown if Xerxes ever learned to read or write, with the Persians favouring oral history over written literature.{{sfn|Stoneman|2015|p=29}} Stoneman suggests that Xerxes' upbringing and education was possibly not much different from that of the later Iranian kings, such as [[Abbas the Great]], king of the [[Safavid Empire]] in the 17th-century AD.{{sfn|Stoneman|2015|p=29}} Starting from 498 BC, Xerxes resided in the royal palace of [[Babylon]].{{sfn|Dandamayev|1989|p=183}}\n\n=== Accession to the throne ===\nWhile Darius was preparing for another war against Greece, a revolt spurred in Egypt in 486&nbsp;BC due to heavy taxes and the deportation of craftsmen to build the royal palaces at Susa and Persepolis. Under Persian law, the king was required to choose a successor before setting out on dangerous expeditions. When Darius decided to leave (487\u2013486&nbsp;BC), he (Darius) prepared his tomb at [[Naqsh-e Rustam]] (five kilometers from his royal palace at Persepolis) and appointed Xerxes, his eldest son by [[Atossa]], as his successor. However, Darius could not lead the campaign due to his failing health and died in October 486&nbsp;BC at the age of 64.{{sfn|Dandamayev|1989|pp=178\u2013179}}\n\n[[Artobazan]] claimed the crown as the eldest of all the children; while Xerxes, on the other hand, argued that he was sprung from Atossa, the daughter of Cyrus, and that it was Cyrus who had won the Persians their freedom. Xerxes was also helped by a Spartan king in exile who was present in Persia at the time, Eurypontid king [[Demaratus]], who also argued that the eldest son does not universally mean they have claim to the crown, as Spartan law states that the first son born while the father is king is the heir to the kingship.<ref>[[Herodotus]] 7.1\u20135</ref>  Some modern scholars also view the unusual decision of Darius to give the throne to Xerxes to be a result of his consideration of the unique positions that Cyrus the Great and his daughter Atossa enjoyed.<ref>[[#refshabani-xerxes|R. Shabani]] Chapter I, p. 15</ref> [[Artobazan]] was born to \"Darius the subject\", while Xerxes was the eldest son [[born in the purple]] after Darius's rise to the throne, and Artobazan's mother was a commoner while Xerxes's mother was the daughter of the founder of the empire.<ref>[[#ref|Olmstead: The history of Persian empire]]</ref>\n\nXerxes was crowned and succeeded his father in October\u2013December 486&nbsp;BC<ref name=chi-v2>[[#refchi-v2google|''The Cambridge History of Iran'' vol. 2]]. p. 509.</ref> when he was about 36 years old.{{sfn|Dandamayev|1989|p=180}} The transition of power to Xerxes was smooth due again in part to the great authority of Atossa<ref name=atossa-EI>Schmitt, R., \"[[#refatossa-EI|Atossa]]\" in ''Encyclopaedia Iranica''.</ref> and his accession of royal power was not challenged by any person at court or in the Achaemenian family, or any subject nation.<ref>[[#refcah-vv|''The Cambridge Ancient History'' vol.

Fletcher, 1690]]\nAt Xerxes' accession, trouble was brewing in some of his domains. A revolt occurred in [[Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt|Egypt]], which seems to have been dangerous enough for Xerxes to personally lead the army to restore order (which also gave him the opportunity to begin his reign with a military campaign).{{sfn|Briant|2002|p=525}} Xerxes surpressed the revolt in January 484 BC, and appointed his full-brother [[Achaemenes (satrap)|Achaemenes]] as [[satrap]] of the country, replacing the previous satrap [[Pherendates]], who was reportedly killed during the revolt.{{sfn|Dandamayev|1983|p=414}}{{sfn|Dandamayev|1989|p=183}} The supression of the Egyptian revolt expended the army, which had been mobilized by Darius over the previous three years.{{sfn|Briant|2002|p=525}} Xerxes thus had to raise another army for his expedition into Greece, which would take four years.{{sfn|Briant|2002|p=525}} There was also unrest in Babylon, which revolted at least twice against Xerxes. The first revolt broke out in June or July of 484 BC and was led by a rebel of the name [[Bel-shimanni]]. Bel-shimmani's revolt was short-lived, Babylonian documents written during his reign only account for a period of two weeks.{{sfn|Dandamayev|1993|p=41}}\n\nTwo years later, Babylon produced another rebel leader, [[Shamash-eriba]]. Beginning in the summer of 482 BC, Shamash-eriba seized Babylon itself and other nearby cities, such as [[Borsippa]] and [[Dilbat]], and was only defeated in March 481 BC after a lengthy siege of Babylon.{{sfn|Dandamayev|1993|p=41}} The precise cause of the unrest in Babylon is uncertain.{{sfn|Briant|2002|p=525}} It may have been due to tax increase.{{sfn|Stoneman|2015|p=111}} Prior to these revolts, Babylon had occupied a special position within the Achaemenid Empire, the Achaemenid kings had been titled as \"[[King of Babylon]]\" and \"[[King of the Lands]]\", perceiving [[Babylonia]] as a somewhat separate entity within their empire, united with their own kingdom in a [[personal union]]. Xerxes dropped \"King of Babylon\" from his titulature and divided the previously large Babylonian satrapy (accounting for most of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]]'s territory) into smaller sub-units.{{sfn|Dandamayev|1989|pp=185\u2013186}}\n\nUsing texts written by classical authors, it is often assumed that Xerxes enacted a brutal vengeance on Babylon following the two revolts. According to ancient writers, Xerxes destroyed Babylon's fortifications and damaged the temples in the city.{{sfn|Dandamayev|1993|p=41}} The [[Esagila]] was allegedly exposed to great damage and Xerxes allegedly carried the [[statue of Marduk]] away from the city,{{sfn|Sancisi-Weerdenburg|2002|p=579}} possibly bringing it to Iran and melting it down (classical authors held that the statue was entirely made of gold, which would have made melting it down possible).{{sfn|Dandamayev|1993|p=41}} Modern historian [[Am\u00e9lie Kuhrt]] considers it unlikely that Xerxes destroyed the temples, but believes that the story of him doing so may derive from an anti-Persian sentiment among the Babylonians.{{sfn|Deloucas|2016|p=39}} It is doubtful if the statue was removed from Babylon at all{{sfn|Dandamayev|1993|p=41}} and some have even suggested that Xerxes did remove a statue from the city, but that this was the golden statue of a man rather than the statue of the god [[Marduk]].{{sfn|Waerzeggers|Seire|2018|p=3}}{{sfn|Briant|2002|p=544}} Though mentions of it are lacking considerably compared to earlier periods, contemporary documents suggest that the Babylonian [[Akitu|New Year's Festival]] continued in some form during the Achaemenid period.{{sfn|Deloucas|2016|p=40}} Because the change in rulership from the Babylonians themselves to the Persians and due to the replacement of the city's elite families by Xerxes following its revolt, it is possible that the festival's traditional rituals and events had changed considerably.{{sfn|Deloucas|2016|p=41}}\n\n==Campaigns==\n\n===Invasion of the Greek mainland===\n{{Main article|Second Persian invasion of Greece}}\n[[File:Xerxes all ethnicities.jpg|thumb|400px|The soldiers of Xerxes I, of all ethnicities,<ref>[http://www.iranicaonline.org/uploads/files/Clothing/v5f7a014_f1_300.jpg Soldiers with names], after Walser</ref> on the tomb of Xerxes I, at [[Naqsh-e Rostam]].<ref>The Achaemenid Empire in South Asia and Recent Excavations in Akra in Northwest Pakistan Peter Magee, Cameron Petrie, Robert Knox, Farid Khan, Ken Thomas [https://repository.brynmawr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1082&context=arch_pubs p. 713]</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Naq\u0161-e-Rostam \u2013 Encyclopaedia Iranica |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/naqs-e-rostam |language=en}}</ref>]]\nDarius died while in the process of preparing a second army to invade the Greek mainland, leaving to his son the task of punishing the [[Athens|Athenians]], [[Naxos Island|Naxians]], and [[Eretria]]ns for their interference in the [[Ionian Revolt]], the burning of [[Sardis]], and their victory over the Persians at [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]]. From 483&nbsp;BC, Xerxes prepared his expedition: The [[Xerxes Canal]] was dug through the [[isthmus]] of the peninsula of [[Mount Athos]], provisions were stored in the stations on the road through [[Thrace]], and two [[pontoon bridge]]s later known as [[Xerxes' Pontoon Bridges]] were built across the [[Hellespont]].

In retaliation, Xerxes ordered the Hellespont (the strait itself) whipped three hundred times, and had [[fetters]] thrown into the water.

[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].]]\nAt the [[Battle of Thermopylae]], a small force of Greek warriors led by King [[Leonidas I|Leonidas]] of [[Sparta]] resisted the much larger Persian forces, but were ultimately defeated. According to Herodotus, the Persians broke the Spartan [[phalanx]] after a Greek man called [[Ephialtes of Trachis|Ephialtes]] betrayed his country by telling the Persians of another pass around the mountains. At [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]], large storms had destroyed ships from the Greek side and so the battle stopped prematurely as the Greeks received news of the defeat at Thermopylae and retreated. \n\n[[File:Foundations of the Old Athena Temple (foreground).jpg|thumb|left|Foundations of the [[Old Temple of Athena]], destroyed by the armies of Xerxes I during the [[Destruction of Athens]] in 480 BC.]]\nAfter Thermopylae, [[Athens]] was captured. Most of the Athenians had abandoned the city and fled to the island of [[Salamis Island|Salamis]] before Xerxes arrived. A small group attempted to defend the [[Athenian Acropolis]], but they were defeated.

The [[Battle of Salamis]] (September, 480&nbsp;BC) was won by the Greek fleet, after which Xerxes set up a winter camp in [[Thessaly]].\n\nAccording to Herodotus, fearing that the Greeks might attack the bridges across the [[Hellespont]] and trap his army in Europe, Xerxes decided to retreat back to Asia, taking the greater part of the army with him.<ref name=VIII97>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231406;layout=;loc=8.96.1 VIII, 97]</ref> Another cause of the retreat might have been that the continued unrest in [[Babylon]], a key province of the [[Achaemenid Empire|empire]], required the king's personal attention.<ref name=\"livius\">{{cite web|url=https://www.livius.org/saa-san/samas-eriba/samas-eriba.html|publisher=livius.org|title=B\u00eal-\u0161im\u00e2nni and \u0160ama\u0161-eriba \u2013 Livius|accessdate=2016-09-07}}</ref>\nHe left behind a contingent in Greece to finish the campaign under [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]], who according to Herodotus had suggested the retreat in the first place.

He oversaw the building of the [[Gate of All Nations]] and the Hall of a Hundred Columns at Persepolis, which are the largest and most imposing structures of the palace. He oversaw the completion of the [[Apadana]], the [[Tachara]] (Palace of Darius) and the Treasury, all started by Darius, as well as having his own palace built which was twice the size of his father's.

Although Artabanus bore the same name as the famed uncle of Xerxes, a [[Hyrcanian]], his rise to prominence was due to his popularity in religious quarters of the court and harem intrigues. He put his seven sons in key positions and had a plan to dethrone the [[Achaemenid dynasty|Achaemenids]].<ref>[[#refkhshayayrsha|Iran-e-Bastan/Pirnia book 1 p. 873]]</ref>\n\nGreek historians give contradicting accounts of events. According to [[Ctesias]] (in Persica 20), Artabanus then accused the Crown Prince Darius, Xerxes's eldest son, of the murder and persuaded another of Xerxes's sons, [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes]], to avenge the patricide by killing Darius. But according to [[Aristotle]] (in Politics 5.1311b), Artabanus killed Darius first and then killed Xerxes.

Xerxes is the protagonist of the opera ''[[Serse]]'' by the German-English [[Baroque]] composer [[George Frideric Handel]]. It was first performed in the [[Her Majesty's Theatre|King's Theatre]] London on 15 April 1738. The famous [[aria]] \"[[Ombra mai f\u00f9]]\" opens the opera.\n\nThe murder of Xerxes by Artabanus (''Artabano''), execution of crown prince Darius (''Dario''), revolt by Megabyzus (''Megabise''), and subsequent succession of [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes I]] is romanticised by the Italian poet [[Metastasio]] in his opera libretto ''[[Artaserse]]'', which was first set to music by [[Leonardo Vinci]], and subsequently by other composers such as [[Johann Adolf Hasse]] and [[Johann Christian Bach]].{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe historical novel ''Xerxes of de Hoogmoed'' (1919) by Dutch writer [[Louis Couperus]] describes the Persian wars from the perspective of Xerxes. Though the account is fictionalised, Couperus nevertheless based himself on an extensive study of Herodotus. The English translation ''Arrogance: The Conquests of Xerxes'' by Frederick H. Martens appeared in 1930. \n\n[[File:Esther haram.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Queen [[Esther]], a [[Jewish]] queen of Xerxes.

He was played by [[David Farrar (actor)|David Farrar]] in the fictional film ''[[The 300 Spartans]]'' ([[1962 in film|1962]]), where he is portrayed as a cruel, power-crazed despot and an inept commander. He also features prominently in the graphic novels ''[[300 (comics)|300]]'' and ''[[Xerxes: The Fall of the House of Darius and the Rise of Alexander]]'' by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], as well as the film adaptation ''[[300 (film)|300]]'' ([[2007 in film|2007]]) and its sequel ''[[300: Rise of an Empire]]'' ([[2014 in film|2014]]), as portrayed by [[Brazil]]ian actor [[Rodrigo Santoro]], in which he is represented as a giant man with androgynous qualities, who claims to be a god-king. This portrayal has attracted controversy, especially in [[Iran]].<ref>Boucher, Geoff [http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2010/06/01/xerxes-300-frank-miller-300-zack-snyder-300/ \"Frank Miller returns to the '300' battlefield with 'Xerxes': 'I make no apologies whatsoever'\"], ''The Los Angeles Times'', June 1, 2010, accessed 2010-05-14.</ref> [[Ken Davitian]] plays Xerxes in ''[[Meet the Spartans]]'', a parody of the first ''300'' movie replete with sophomoric humour and deliberate [[anachronisms]].\n\nOther works dealing with the Persian Empire or the Biblical story of [[Esther]] have also featured or alluded to Xerxes, such as the video game ''[[Assassin's Creed II]]'' and the film ''[[One Night with the King]]'' ([[2006 in film|2006]]), in which [[Ahasuerus]] (Xerxes) was portrayed by British actor [[Luke Goss]]. He is the leader of the Persian Empire in the video game ''[[Civilization II]]'' and ''[[Civilization III|III]]'' (along with [[Scheherazade]]), although ''[[Civilization IV]]'' replaces him with [[Cyrus the Great]] and [[Darius I]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n[[File:Xerxes by Ernest Normand.jpg|thumb|upright|Xerxes ([[Ahasuerus]]) by [[Ernest Normand]], 1888 (detail).]]\n[[Gore Vidal]], in his historical fiction novel ''[[Creation (novel)|Creation]]'' (1981), describes at length the rise of the Achemenids, especially Darius I, and presents the life and death circumstances of Xerxes. Vidal's version of the Persian Wars, which diverges from the orthodoxy of the Greek histories, is told through the invented character of Cyrus Spitama, a half-Greek, half-Persian, and grandson of the prophet [[Zoroaster]]. Thanks to his family connection, Cyrus is brought up in the Persian court after the murder of Zoroaster, becoming the boyhood friend of Xerxes, and later a diplomat who is sent to India, and later to Greece, and who is thereby able to gain privileged access to many leading historical figures of the period.<ref>Gore Vidal, ''Creation: A Novel'' (Random House, 1981)</ref>\n\nXerxes ([[Ahasuerus]]) is portrayed by [[Richard Egan (actor)|Richard Egan]] in the 1960 film ''[[Esther and the King]]'' and by [[Joel Smallbone]] in the 2013 film, ''[[The Book of Esther (film)|The Book of Esther]]''.

When reaching the age of 7, they learn how to ride and hunt; at age 14, they are looked after by four teachers of aristocratic stock, who teach them how to be \"wise, just, prudent and brave.\"{{sfn|Stoneman|2015|p=27}} Persian princes were also taught on the basics of the [[Zoroastrian]] religion, to be truthful, have self-restraint, and to be courageous.{{sfn|Stoneman|2015|p=27}} The dialogue further adds that \"Fear, for a Persian, is the equivalent of slavery.\"{{sfn|Stoneman|2015|p=27}} At the age of 16 or 17, they begin their \"national service\" for 10 years, which included practicing archery and javelin, competing for prizes, and hunting.{{sfn|Stoneman|2015|p=28}} Afterwards they serve in the military for around 25 years, and are then elevated to the status of elders and advisers of the king.{{sfn|Stoneman|2015|p=28}} \n\nThis account of education amongst the Persian elite is supported by [[Xenophon]]'s description of the 5th-century BC Achaemenid prince [[Cyrus the Younger]], whom he was well-acquainted with.{{sfn|Stoneman|2015|p=28}} Stoneman suggests that this was the type of upbringing and education that Xerxes experienced.{{sfn|Stoneman|2015|p=29}} It is unknown if Xerxes ever learned to read or write, with the Persians favouring oral history over written literature.{{sfn|Stoneman|2015|p=29}} Stoneman suggests that Xerxes' upbringing and education was possibly not much different from that of the later Iranian kings, such as [[Abbas the Great]], king of the [[Safavid Empire]] in the 17th-century AD.{{sfn|Stoneman|2015|p=29}} Starting from 498 BC, Xerxes resided in the royal palace of [[Babylon]].{{sfn|Dandamayev|1989|p=183}}\n\n=== Accession to the throne ===\nWhile Darius was preparing for another war against Greece, a revolt spurred in Egypt in 486&nbsp;BC due to heavy taxes and the deportation of craftsmen to build the royal palaces at Susa and Persepolis. Under Persian law, the king was required to choose a successor before setting out on dangerous expeditions. When Darius decided to leave (487\u2013486&nbsp;BC), he (Darius) prepared his tomb at [[Naqsh-e Rustam]] (five kilometers from his royal palace at Persepolis) and appointed Xerxes, his eldest son by [[Atossa]], as his successor. However, Darius could not lead the campaign due to his failing health and died in October 486&nbsp;BC at the age of 64.{{sfn|Dandamayev|1989|pp=178\u2013179}}\n\n[[Artobazan]] claimed the crown as the eldest of all the children; while Xerxes, on the other hand, argued that he was sprung from Atossa, the daughter of Cyrus, and that it was Cyrus who had won the Persians their freedom. Xerxes was also helped by a Spartan king in exile who was present in Persia at the time, Eurypontid king [[Demaratus]], who also argued that the eldest son does not universally mean they have claim to the crown, as Spartan law states that the first son born while the father is king is the heir to the kingship.<ref>[[Herodotus]] 7.1\u20135</ref>  Some modern scholars also view the unusual decision of Darius to give the throne to Xerxes to be a result of his consideration of the unique positions that Cyrus the Great and his daughter Atossa enjoyed.<ref>[[#refshabani-xerxes|R.

Fletcher, 1690]]\nAt Xerxes' accession, trouble was brewing in some of his domains. A revolt occurred in [[Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt|Egypt]], which seems to have been dangerous enough for Xerxes to personally lead the army to restore order (which also gave him the opportunity to begin his reign with a military campaign).{{sfn|Briant|2002|p=525}} Xerxes surpressed the revolt in January 484 BC, and appointed his full-brother [[Achaemenes (satrap)|Achaemenes]] as [[satrap]] of the country, replacing the previous satrap [[Pherendates]], who was reportedly killed during the revolt.{{sfn|Dandamayev|1983|p=414}}{{sfn|Dandamayev|1989|p=183}} The supression of the Egyptian revolt expended the army, which had been mobilized by Darius over the previous three years.{{sfn|Briant|2002|p=525}} Xerxes thus had to raise another army for his expedition into Greece, which would take four years.{{sfn|Briant|2002|p=525}} There was also unrest in Babylon, which revolted at least twice against Xerxes. The first revolt broke out in June or July of 484 BC and was led by a rebel of the name [[Bel-shimanni]]. Bel-shimmani's revolt was short-lived, Babylonian documents written during his reign only account for a period of two weeks.{{sfn|Dandamayev|1993|p=41}}\n\nTwo years later, Babylon produced another rebel leader, [[Shamash-eriba]]. Beginning in the summer of 482 BC, Shamash-eriba seized Babylon itself and other nearby cities, such as [[Borsippa]] and [[Dilbat]], and was only defeated in March 481 BC after a lengthy siege of Babylon.{{sfn|Dandamayev|1993|p=41}} The precise cause of the unrest in Babylon is uncertain.{{sfn|Briant|2002|p=525}} It may have been due to tax increase.{{sfn|Stoneman|2015|p=111}} Prior to these revolts, Babylon had occupied a special position within the Achaemenid Empire, the Achaemenid kings had been titled as \"[[King of Babylon]]\" and \"[[King of the Lands]]\", perceiving [[Babylonia]] as a somewhat separate entity within their empire, united with their own kingdom in a [[personal union]]. Xerxes dropped \"King of Babylon\" from his titulature and divided the previously large Babylonian satrapy (accounting for most of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]]'s territory) into smaller sub-units.{{sfn|Dandamayev|1989|pp=185\u2013186}}\n\nUsing texts written by classical authors, it is often assumed that Xerxes enacted a brutal vengeance on Babylon following the two revolts. According to ancient writers, Xerxes destroyed Babylon's fortifications and damaged the temples in the city.{{sfn|Dandamayev|1993|p=41}} The [[Esagila]] was allegedly exposed to great damage and Xerxes allegedly carried the [[statue of Marduk]] away from the city,{{sfn|Sancisi-Weerdenburg|2002|p=579}} possibly bringing it to Iran and melting it down (classical authors held that the statue was entirely made of gold, which would have made melting it down possible).{{sfn|Dandamayev|1993|p=41}} Modern historian [[Am\u00e9lie Kuhrt]] considers it unlikely that Xerxes destroyed the temples, but believes that the story of him doing so may derive from an anti-Persian sentiment among the Babylonians.{{sfn|Deloucas|2016|p=39}} It is doubtful if the statue was removed from Babylon at all{{sfn|Dandamayev|1993|p=41}} and some have even suggested that Xerxes did remove a statue from the city, but that this was the golden statue of a man rather than the statue of the god [[Marduk]].{{sfn|Waerzeggers|Seire|2018|p=3}}{{sfn|Briant|2002|p=544}} Though mentions of it are lacking considerably compared to earlier periods, contemporary documents suggest that the Babylonian [[Akitu|New Year's Festival]] continued in some form during the Achaemenid period.{{sfn|Deloucas|2016|p=40}} Because the change in rulership from the Babylonians themselves to the Persians and due to the replacement of the city's elite families by Xerxes following its revolt, it is possible that the festival's traditional rituals and events had changed considerably.{{sfn|Deloucas|2016|p=41}}\n\n==Campaigns==\n\n===Invasion of the Greek mainland===\n{{Main article|Second Persian invasion of Greece}}\n[[File:Xerxes all ethnicities.jpg|thumb|400px|The soldiers of Xerxes I, of all ethnicities,<ref>[http://www.iranicaonline.org/uploads/files/Clothing/v5f7a014_f1_300.jpg Soldiers with names], after Walser</ref> on the tomb of Xerxes I, at [[Naqsh-e Rostam]].<ref>The Achaemenid Empire in South Asia and Recent Excavations in Akra in Northwest Pakistan Peter Magee, Cameron Petrie, Robert Knox, Farid Khan, Ken Thomas [https://repository.brynmawr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1082&context=arch_pubs p. 713]</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Naq\u0161-e-Rostam \u2013 Encyclopaedia Iranica |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/naqs-e-rostam |language=en}}</ref>]]\nDarius died while in the process of preparing a second army to invade the Greek mainland, leaving to his son the task of punishing the [[Athens|Athenians]], [[Naxos Island|Naxians]], and [[Eretria]]ns for their interference in the [[Ionian Revolt]], the burning of [[Sardis]], and their victory over the Persians at [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]].

According to Herodotus, the Persians broke the Spartan [[phalanx]] after a Greek man called [[Ephialtes of Trachis|Ephialtes]] betrayed his country by telling the Persians of another pass around the mountains. At [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]], large storms had destroyed ships from the Greek side and so the battle stopped prematurely as the Greeks received news of the defeat at Thermopylae and retreated. \n\n[[File:Foundations of the Old Athena Temple (foreground).jpg|thumb|left|Foundations of the [[Old Temple of Athena]], destroyed by the armies of Xerxes I during the [[Destruction of Athens]] in 480 BC.]]\nAfter Thermopylae, [[Athens]] was captured. Most of the Athenians had abandoned the city and fled to the island of [[Salamis Island|Salamis]] before Xerxes arrived. A small group attempted to defend the [[Athenian Acropolis]], but they were defeated. Xerxes ordered the [[Destruction of Athens]] and burnt the city, leaving an archaeologically attested destruction layer, known as the [[Perserschutt]].<ref>Martin Steskal, ''Der Zerst\u00f6rungsbefund 480/79 der Athener Akropolis.

The [[Battle of Salamis]] (September, 480&nbsp;BC) was won by the Greek fleet, after which Xerxes set up a winter camp in [[Thessaly]].\n\nAccording to Herodotus, fearing that the Greeks might attack the bridges across the [[Hellespont]] and trap his army in Europe, Xerxes decided to retreat back to Asia, taking the greater part of the army with him.<ref name=VIII97>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231406;layout=;loc=8.96.1 VIII, 97]</ref> Another cause of the retreat might have been that the continued unrest in [[Babylon]], a key province of the [[Achaemenid Empire|empire]], required the king's personal attention.<ref name=\"livius\">{{cite web|url=https://www.livius.org/saa-san/samas-eriba/samas-eriba.html|publisher=livius.org|title=B\u00eal-\u0161im\u00e2nni and \u0160ama\u0161-eriba \u2013 Livius|accessdate=2016-09-07}}</ref>\nHe left behind a contingent in Greece to finish the campaign under [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]], who according to Herodotus had suggested the retreat in the first place.

He oversaw the building of the [[Gate of All Nations]] and the Hall of a Hundred Columns at Persepolis, which are the largest and most imposing structures of the palace. He oversaw the completion of the [[Apadana]], the [[Tachara]] (Palace of Darius) and the Treasury, all started by Darius, as well as having his own palace built which was twice the size of his father's.

According to [[Ctesias]] (in Persica 20), Artabanus then accused the Crown Prince Darius, Xerxes's eldest son, of the murder and persuaded another of Xerxes's sons, [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes]], to avenge the patricide by killing Darius. But according to [[Aristotle]] (in Politics 5.1311b), Artabanus killed Darius first and then killed Xerxes.

Vidal's version of the Persian Wars, which diverges from the orthodoxy of the Greek histories, is told through the invented character of Cyrus Spitama, a half-Greek, half-Persian, and grandson of the prophet [[Zoroaster]]. Thanks to his family connection, Cyrus is brought up in the Persian court after the murder of Zoroaster, becoming the boyhood friend of Xerxes, and later a diplomat who is sent to India, and later to Greece, and who is thereby able to gain privileged access to many leading historical figures of the period.<ref>Gore Vidal, ''Creation: A Novel'' (Random House, 1981)</ref>\n\nXerxes ([[Ahasuerus]]) is portrayed by [[Richard Egan (actor)|Richard Egan]] in the 1960 film ''[[Esther and the King]]'' and by [[Joel Smallbone]] in the 2013 film, ''[[The Book of Esther (film)|The Book of Esther]]''.

It occurred early in the morning of July 11, 1804,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/jul11.html |title=Today in History: July 11 |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=April 23, 2007}}</ref> and was the culmination of a long and bitter rivalry between the two men. Vice President Burr shot Hamilton, while Hamilton's shot broke a tree branch directly above Burr's head. Hamilton was carried to the home of [[William Bayard Jr.]] where he died the next day.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Schuyler.jpg|thumb|[[Philip Schuyler]], Hamilton's father in law.]] \nThe Burr\u2013Hamilton duel is one of the most famous personal conflicts in American history. It was a pistol duel which arose from long-standing personal bitterness that developed between the two men over the course of several years. Tension rose with Hamilton's journalistic defamation of Burr's character during the 1804 New York gubernatorial race, in which Burr was a candidate.\n\nThe duel was fought at a time when the practice was being outlawed in the northern United States, and it had immense political ramifications. Burr survived the duel and was indicted for murder in both [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]], though these charges were later either dismissed or resulted in acquittal. The harsh criticism and animosity directed toward him following the duel brought an end to his political career. The [[Federalist Party]] was already weakened by the defeat of [[John Adams]] in the presidential election of 1800 and was further weakened by Hamilton's death.\n\nThe duel was the final skirmish of a long conflict between [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republicans]] and Federalists. The conflict began in 1791 when Burr won a United States Senate seat from [[Philip Schuyler]], Hamilton's father-in-law, who would have supported Federalist policies. (Hamilton was the Secretary of the Treasury at the time.) The [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] then deadlocked in the election of 1800, during which Hamilton's maneuvering in the House of Representatives caused [[Thomas Jefferson]] to be named president and Burr vice-president.<ref>See, for example, ''[http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/early-republic/resources/%E2%80%9Cjefferson-every-view-less-dangerous-burr%E2%80%9D-hamilton-election \"Jefferson is in every view less dangerous than Burr\": Hamilton on the election of 1800]'' (Letter from Alexander Hamilton to Harrison Gray Otis: December 23, 1800).</ref>\n\nHamilton's animosity toward Burr was severe and well-documented in personal letters to his friend and compatriot [[James McHenry]]. The following quotation from one of these letters on January 4, 1801, exemplifies his bitterness:\n\n<blockquote>Nothing has given me so much chagrin as the Intelligence that the Federal party were thinking seriously of supporting Mr. Burr for president.  I should consider the execution of the plan as [[wikt:devote#3|devoting]] the country and signing their own death warrant.  Mr. Burr will probably make stipulations, but he will laugh in his sleeve while he makes them and will break them the first moment it may serve his purpose.<ref name=\"Steiner\">Bernard C. Steiner and James McHenry, ''[https://archive.org/details/lifeandcorrespo02steigoog The life and correspondence of James McHenry]'' (Cleveland: Burrows Brothers Co., 1907).</ref></blockquote>\n\nHamilton details the many charges that he has against Burr in a more extensive letter written shortly afterward, calling him a \"profligate, a voluptuary in the extreme\", accusing him of corruptly serving the interests of the [[Holland Land Company]] while a member of the legislature, criticizing his military commission and accusing him of resigning it under false pretenses, and many more serious accusations.<ref name=\"Steiner\"/>\n\n[[File:Morgan Lewis (portrait by Henry Inman).png|thumb|right|[[Morgan Lewis (governor)|Morgan Lewis]], endorsed by Hamilton, defeated Burr in the 1804 New York gubernatorial election.]]\n\nIt became clear that Jefferson would drop Burr from his ticket in the 1804 election, so the Vice President ran for the governorship of New York instead.{{citation needed|date = January 2017}} Hamilton campaigned vigorously against Burr, who was running as an independent, causing him to lose to [[Morgan Lewis (governor)|Morgan Lewis]], a Democratic-Republican endorsed by Hamilton.{{Citation needed|date = January 2017}}\n\nBoth men had been involved in duels in the past. Hamilton had been the second in several duels, although never the duelist himself, but he was involved in more than a dozen affairs of honor<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freeman |first1=Joanne B. |title=Affairs of Honor: National Politics in the New Republic |date=2002 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=326-327}}</ref> prior to his fatal encounter with Burr, including disputes with [[William Gordon (New Hampshire politician)|William Gordon]] (1779), [[Aedanus Burke]] (1790), [[John Francis Mercer]] (1792\u20131793), [[James Nicholson (naval officer)|James Nicholson]] (1795), [[James Monroe]] (1797), and Ebenezer Purdy and [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] (1804). He also served as a second to [[John Laurens]] in a 1779 duel with General [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]], and to legal client John Auldjo in a 1787 duel with [[William Pierce (politician)|William Pierce]].<ref>Freeman, 1996, pp. 294\u2013295.</ref> Hamilton also claimed that he had one previous honor dispute with Burr,<ref>Nathaniel Pendleton to Van Ness.

''Papers of Aaron Burr'', 2: 887.</ref><ref>Additionally, Hamilton's son [[Philip Hamilton|Philip]] was killed in a November 23, 1801, duel with George I. Eacker, initiated after Philip and his friend Richard Price engaged in \"hooliganish\" behavior in Eacker's box at the [[Park Theatre (Manhattan, New York)]]. This was in response to a speech which Eacker had made on July 3, 1801, that was critical of Hamilton. Philip and his friend both challenged Eacker to duels when he called them \"damned rascals\" (Fleming, 1999, pp. 7\u20139). Price's duel (also at Weehawken) resulted in nothing more than four missed shots, and Hamilton advised his son to ''delope'' (throw away his shot). However, both Philip and Eacker stood shotless for a minute after the command \"present\", then Philip leveled his pistol, causing Eacker to fire, mortally wounding Philip and sending his shot awry.</ref>\n\n===Election of 1800===\n{{main|United States presidential election, 1800}}\n\nBurr and Hamilton first came into public opposition during the United States presidential election of 1800. Burr ran for Vice President on the Democratic-Republican ticket, along with Thomas Jefferson, against President John Adams (the Federalist incumbent) and his vice presidential running mate [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney|Charles C. Pinckney]]. Electoral College rules at the time gave each elector two votes for president. The candidate who received the second most votes became vice president.\n\nThe Democratic-Republican Party planned to have 72 of their 73 electors vote for both Jefferson and Burr, with the remaining elector voting only for Jefferson. The electors failed to execute this plan, so Burr and Jefferson were tied with 73 votes each. The Constitution stipulates that if no candidate wins a majority, the election is moved to the House of Representatives\u2014which was controlled by the Federalists, at this point, many of whom were loath to vote for Jefferson. Hamilton regarded Burr as far more dangerous than Jefferson and used all his influence to ensure Jefferson's election. On the 36th ballot, the House of Representatives gave Jefferson the presidency, with Burr becoming Vice President.\n\n===Charles Cooper's letter===\n{{Wikisourcehas|original texts related to|[[s:Hamilton-Burr duel correspondences|Hamilton\u2013Burr duel correspondences]]}}\nOn April 24, 1804, the ''Albany Register'' published a letter opposing Burr's candidacy<ref>Cooper, Charles D.

Van Ness which pointed particularly to the phrase \"more despicable\" and demanded \"a prompt and unqualified acknowledgment or denial of the use of any expression which would warrant the assertion of Dr. Cooper.\" Hamilton's verbose reply on June 20, 1804, indicated that he could not be held responsible for Cooper's interpretation of his words (yet he did not fault that interpretation), concluding that he would \"abide the consequences\" should Burr remain unsatisfied.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-26-02-0001-0205 |title=From Alexander Hamilton to Aaron Burr, 20 June 1804 |website=Founders.archives.gov |date=June 29, 2016 |accessdate=July 9, 2016}}</ref> A recurring theme in their correspondence is that Burr seeks avowal or disavowal of ''anything'' that could justify Cooper's characterization, while Hamilton protests that there are no ''specifics''.\n\nBurr replied on June 21, 1804, also delivered by Van Ness, stating that \"political opposition can never absolve gentlemen from the necessity of a rigid adherence to the laws of honor and the rules of decorum\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-26-02-0001-0207 |title=To Alexander Hamilton from Aaron Burr, 21 June 1804 |website=Founders.archives.gov |date=June 29, 2016 |accessdate=July 9, 2016}}</ref> Hamilton replied that he had \"no other answer to give than that which has already been given\".

General Hamilton cannot recollect distinctly the particulars of that conversation, so as to undertake to repeat them, without running the risk of varying or omitting what might be deemed important circumstances. The expressions are entirely forgotten, and the specific ideas imperfectly remembered; but to the best of his recollection it consisted of comments on the political principles and views of Colonel Burr, and the results that might be expected from them in the event of his election as Governor, without reference to any particular instance of past conduct or private character.<ref>Winfield, 1875, pp. 216\u2013217.</ref>}}\n\nEventually, Burr issued a formal challenge and Hamilton accepted.<ref>Winfield, 1875, p. 217.</ref> Many historians have considered the causes of the duel to be flimsy and have thus characterized Hamilton as \"suicidal\", Burr as \"malicious and murderous\", or both.<ref>Freeman, 1996, p. 290.</ref> Thomas Fleming offers the theory that Burr may have been attempting to recover his honor by challenging Hamilton, whom he considered to be the only gentleman among his detractors, in response to the slanderous attacks against his character published during the 1804 gubernatorial campaign.<ref>Fleming, p. 281</ref>\n\nHamilton's reasons for not engaging in a duel included his roles as father and husband, putting his creditors at risk, and placing his family's welfare in jeopardy, but he felt that it would be impossible to avoid a duel because he had made attacks on Burr which he was unable to recant, and because of Burr's behavior prior to the duel. He attempted to reconcile his moral and religious reasons and the codes of honor and politics. Joanne Freeman speculates that Hamilton intended to accept the duel and throw away his shot in order to satisfy his moral and political codes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dueling as Politics: Reinterpreting the Burr\u2013Hamilton Duel|last=Freeman|first=Joanne|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==The duel==\n[[File:Duel between Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton.jpg|thumb|left|Artistic impression of Burr's shot]]\nIn the early morning of July 11, 1804, Burr and Hamilton departed from Manhattan by separate boats and rowed across the [[Hudson River]] to a spot known as the Heights of [[Weehawken, New Jersey]], a popular dueling ground below the towering cliffs of the [[New Jersey Palisades]].<ref name=\"teachinghistory\">Buescher, John. \"[http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24404 Burr\u2013Hamilton Duel].\" [http://www.teachinghistory.org Teachinghistory.org]. Accessed July 11, 2011.</ref> Dueling had been prohibited in both New York and New Jersey, but Hamilton and Burr agreed to go to Weehawken because New Jersey was not as aggressive as New York in prosecuting dueling participants. The same site was used for 18 known duels between 1700 and 1845, including the 1801 duel that killed Hamilton's eldest son [[Philip Hamilton]].<ref>Demontreux, 2004, p. 3.</ref> They also took steps to give all witnesses plausible deniability in an attempt to shield themselves from prosecution. For example, the pistols were transported to the island in a portmanteau, enabling the rowers to say under oath that they had not seen any pistols. They also stood with their backs to the duelists.<ref>Chernow, p. 700.</ref>\n\nBurr, [[William Peter Van Ness]] (his [[second (duel)|second]]), Matthew L. Davis, another man (often identified as John Swarthout), and the rowers all reached the site at 6:30&nbsp;a.m., whereupon Swarthout and Van Ness started to clear the underbrush from the dueling ground. Hamilton, Judge [[Nathaniel Pendleton]] (his second), and [[David Hosack]] arrived a few minutes before seven. Lots were cast for the choice of position and which second should start the duel. Both were won by Hamilton's second, who chose the upper edge of the ledge for Hamilton, facing the city.<ref name=\"Winfield 219\">Winfield, 1874, p. 219.</ref> However, [[Joseph Ellis]] claims that Hamilton had been challenged and therefore had choice of both weapon and position. Under this account, it was Hamilton himself who chose the upstream or north side position.<ref name=\"Ellis 24\">Ellis, Joseph. Founding Brothers. p. 24</ref>\n\nAll first-hand accounts of the duel agree that two shots were fired, although the seconds disagreed on the intervening time between them. It was common for both principals in a duel to fire a shot at the ground to exemplify courage, and then the duel could come to an end. Hamilton apparently fired a shot above Burr's head. Burr returned fire and hit Hamilton in the lower abdomen above the right hip.<ref name=\"Winfield, 1874, pp. 219\u2013220\">Winfield, 1874, pp. 219\u2013220.</ref> The large-caliber lead ball ricocheted off Hamilton's third or second [[False ribs|false rib]], fracturing it and causing considerable damage to his internal organs, particularly his liver and diaphragm, before lodging in his first or second [[lumbar vertebra]]. According to Pendleton's account, Hamilton collapsed almost immediately, dropping the pistol involuntarily, and Burr moved toward him in a speechless manner (which Pendleton deemed to be indicative of regret) before being hustled away behind an umbrella by Van Ness because Hosack and the rowers were already approaching.<ref name=\"Winfield, 1874, pp. 219\u2013220\"/>\n\nIt is entirely uncertain which principal fired first, as both seconds' backs were to the duel in accordance with the pre-arranged regulations so that they could testify that they \"saw no fire\". After much research to determine the actual events of the duel, historian Joseph Ellis gives his best guess:\n\n{{quote|Hamilton did fire his weapon intentionally, and he fired first. But he aimed to miss Burr, sending his ball into the tree above and behind Burr's location. In so doing, he did not withhold his shot, but he did waste it, thereby honoring his pre-duel pledge. Meanwhile, Burr, who did not know about the pledge, did know that a projectile from Hamilton's gun had whizzed past him and crashed into the tree to his rear. According to the principles of the [[code duello]], Burr was perfectly justified in taking deadly aim at Hamilton and firing to kill.}}\n\n===David Hosack's account===\nHosack wrote his account on August 17, about one month after the duel had taken place. He testified that he had only seen Hamilton and the two seconds disappear \"into the wood\", heard two shots, and rushed to find a wounded Hamilton. He also testified that he had not seen Burr, who had been hidden behind an umbrella by Van Ness.<ref>''William P. Van Ness vs. The People''. 1805.</ref> He gives a very clear picture of the events in a letter to [[William Coleman (editor)|William Coleman]]:\n\n{{quote|When called to him upon his receiving the fatal wound, I found him half sitting on the ground, supported in the arms of Mr. Pendleton. His countenance of death I shall never forget. He had at that instant just strength to say, \"This is a mortal wound, doctor;\" when he sunk away, and became to all appearance lifeless. I immediately stripped up his clothes, and soon, alas I ascertained that the direction of the ball must have been through some vital part. His pulses were not to be felt, his respiration was entirely suspended, and, upon laying my hand on his heart and perceiving no motion there, I considered him as irrecoverably gone. I, however, observed to Mr. Pendleton, that the only chance for his reviving was immediately to get him upon the water. We therefore lifted him up, and carried him out of the wood to the margin of the bank, where the bargemen aided us in conveying him into the boat, which immediately put off. During all this time I could not discover the least symptom of returning life. I now rubbed his face, lips, and temples with [[spirits of hartshorn]], applied it to his neck and breast, and to the wrists and palms of his hands, and endeavoured to pour some into his mouth.<ref name=\"Hosack Coleman\">Dr. David Hosack to William Coleman, August 17, 1804</ref>}}\n\nHosack goes on to say that Hamilton had revived after a few minutes, either from the hartshorn or fresh air. He finishes his letter:\n\n{{quote|Soon after recovering his sight, he happened to cast his eye upon the case of pistols, and observing the one that he had had in his hand lying on the outside, he said, \"Take care of that pistol; it is undischarged, and still cocked; it may go off and do harm. Pendleton knows\" (attempting to turn his head towards him) \"that I did not intend to fire at him.\" \"Yes,\" said Mr. Pendleton, understanding his wish, \"I have already made Dr. Hosack acquainted with your determination as to that.\" He then closed his eyes and remained calm, without any disposition to speak; nor did he say much afterward, except in reply to my questions. He asked me once or twice how I found his pulse; and he informed me that his lower extremities had lost all feeling, manifesting to me that he entertained no hopes that he should long survive.<ref name=\"Hosack Coleman\" />}}\n\n===Statement to the press===\nPendleton and Van Ness issued a press statement about the events of the duel which pointed out the agreed-upon dueling rules and events that transpired. It stated that both participants were free to open fire once they had been given the order to present. After first fire had been given, the opponent's second would count to three, whereupon the opponent would fire or sacrifice his shot.<ref name=\"URL\">{{cite web |url=http://odur.let.rug.nl/~usa/B/hamilton/hamil43.htm |title=Document: Joint statement on the Duel < A Biography of Alexander Hamilton (1755\u20131804) < Biographies < American History From Revolution To Reconstruction and beyond |website=Odur.let.rug.nl |accessdate=July 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402062544/http://odur.let.rug.nl/%7Eusa/B/hamilton/hamil43.htm |archive-date=April 2, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Pendleton and Van Ness disagree as to who fired the first shot, but they concur that both men had fired \"within a few seconds of each other\" (as they must have; neither Pendleton nor Van Ness mentions counting down).<ref name=\"URL\" />\n\nIn Pendleton's amended version of the statement, he and a friend went to the site of the duel the day after Hamilton's death to discover where Hamilton's shot went. The statement reads: \n\n<blockquote>They ascertained that the ball passed through the limb of a cedar tree, at an elevation of about twelve feet and a half, perpendicularly from the ground, between thirteen and fourteen feet from the mark on which General Hamilton stood, and about four feet wide of the direct line between him and Col. Burr, on the right side; he having fallen on the left.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Nathaniel Pendleton's Amended Version of His and William P.

See Freeman, 1996, note 1.</ref> in which he stated that he was \"strongly opposed to the practice of dueling\" for both religious and practical reasons. \"I have resolved,\" it continued, \"if our interview is conducted in the usual manner, and it pleases God to give me the opportunity, to reserve and throw away my first fire, and I have thoughts even of reserving my second fire.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hamilton|first1=Alexander|title=Statement on Impending Duel with Aaron Burr, (28 June \u2013 10 July 1804)|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-26-02-0001-0241|website=Founders Online}}</ref><ref>Hamilton, 1804, 26:278.</ref>\n\nHamilton regained consciousness after being shot and told Dr. Hosack that his gun was still loaded and that \"Pendleton knows I did not mean to fire at him.\" This is evidence for the theory that Hamilton intended not to fire, honoring his pre-duel pledge, and only fired accidentally upon being hit.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Such an intention would have violated the protocol of the ''code duello'' and, when Burr learned of it, he responded: \"Contemptible, if true.\"<ref>Joseph Wheelan, ''Jefferson's Vendetta: The Pursuit of Aaron Burr and the Judiciary'', New York, Carroll & Graf Publishers, 2005, {{ISBN|0-7867-1437-9}}, p. 90</ref> Hamilton could have thrown away his shot by firing into the ground, thus possibly signaling Burr of his purpose.\n\nModern historians have debated to what extent Hamilton's statements and letter represent his true beliefs, and how much of this was a deliberate attempt to permanently ruin Burr if Hamilton were killed. An example of this may be seen in what one historian has considered to be deliberate attempts to provoke Burr on the dueling ground:\n\n{{quote|Hamilton performed a series of deliberately provocative actions to ensure a lethal outcome.

Hamilton made confidential statements against him, such as those enumerated in his letter to Supreme Court Justice Rutledge. In the attachment to that letter, Hamilton argued against Burr's character on numerous scores: he suspected Burr \"on strong grounds of having corruptly served the views of the Holland Company\"; \"his very friends do not insist on his integrity\"; \"he will court and employ able and daring scoundrels\"; he seeks \"Supreme power in his own person\" and \"will in all likelihood attempt a usurpation\", and so forth.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YbnPAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA251 |title=The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine |accessdate=April 20, 2015|year=1900 }}</ref>\n\n===Pistols===\n[[File:Hamilton-Burr pistols.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Wogdon & Barton]] pistols used in the duel]]\n[[File:Philip Hamilton.jpg|thumb|right|[[Philip Hamilton]] was killed in a duel three years before, near the spot of the Burr\u2013Hamilton duel.]]\nThe pistols used in the duel belonged to Hamilton's brother-in-law [[John Barker Church]], who was a business partner of both Hamilton and Burr.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaronburrassociation.org/duel%20description.htm|title=The two boats rowed back to New York City|website=www.aaronburrassociation.org|access-date=March 27, 2018}}</ref> Later legend claimed that these pistols were the same ones used in a 1799 duel between Church and Burr in which neither man was injured.<ref name=Lindsay>{{cite journal |last1=Lindsay |first1=Merrill |title=Pistols Shed Light on Famed Duel |journal=Smithsonian |date=November 1976 |pages=94\u201398 |url=http://www.aaronburrassociation.org/Smithsonian.htm}}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\">Alexander Hamilton, by Ron Chernow, p. 590</ref> Burr, however, wrote in his memoirs that he supplied the pistols for his duel with Church, and that they belonged to him.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burr|first1=Aaron|last2=Davis|first2=Matthew Livingston|title=Memoirs of Aaron Burr: With Miscellaneous Selections from His Correspondence, Volume 1|date=1837|publisher=Harper & Brothers|page=417|url=https://books.google.com/?id=il4SAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA417|accessdate=February 11, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThe [[Wogdon & Barton]] dueling pistols incorporated a [[wiktionary:hair-trigger|hair-trigger]] feature that could be set by the user.<ref name=Lindsay/><ref>For the [[United States Bicentennial]] in 1976, Chase Manhattan allowed the pistols to be removed and lent to the U.S. Bicentennial Society of Richmond.

It occurred early in the morning of July 11, 1804,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/jul11.html |title=Today in History: July 11 |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=April 23, 2007}}</ref> and was the culmination of a long and bitter rivalry between the two men. Vice President Burr shot Hamilton, while Hamilton's shot broke a tree branch directly above Burr's head. Hamilton was carried to the home of [[William Bayard Jr.]] where he died the next day.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Schuyler.jpg|thumb|[[Philip Schuyler]], Hamilton's father in law.]] \nThe Burr\u2013Hamilton duel is one of the most famous personal conflicts in American history. It was a pistol duel which arose from long-standing personal bitterness that developed between the two men over the course of several years. Tension rose with Hamilton's journalistic defamation of Burr's character during the 1804 New York gubernatorial race, in which Burr was a candidate.\n\nThe duel was fought at a time when the practice was being outlawed in the northern United States, and it had immense political ramifications. Burr survived the duel and was indicted for murder in both [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]], though these charges were later either dismissed or resulted in acquittal. The harsh criticism and animosity directed toward him following the duel brought an end to his political career. The [[Federalist Party]] was already weakened by the defeat of [[John Adams]] in the presidential election of 1800 and was further weakened by Hamilton's death.\n\nThe duel was the final skirmish of a long conflict between [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republicans]] and Federalists. The conflict began in 1791 when Burr won a United States Senate seat from [[Philip Schuyler]], Hamilton's father-in-law, who would have supported Federalist policies. (Hamilton was the Secretary of the Treasury at the time.) The [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] then deadlocked in the election of 1800, during which Hamilton's maneuvering in the House of Representatives caused [[Thomas Jefferson]] to be named president and Burr vice-president.<ref>See, for example, ''[http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/early-republic/resources/%E2%80%9Cjefferson-every-view-less-dangerous-burr%E2%80%9D-hamilton-election \"Jefferson is in every view less dangerous than Burr\": Hamilton on the election of 1800]'' (Letter from Alexander Hamilton to Harrison Gray Otis: December 23, 1800).</ref>\n\nHamilton's animosity toward Burr was severe and well-documented in personal letters to his friend and compatriot [[James McHenry]]. The following quotation from one of these letters on January 4, 1801, exemplifies his bitterness:\n\n<blockquote>Nothing has given me so much chagrin as the Intelligence that the Federal party were thinking seriously of supporting Mr. Burr for president.  I should consider the execution of the plan as [[wikt:devote#3|devoting]] the country and signing their own death warrant.  Mr. Burr will probably make stipulations, but he will laugh in his sleeve while he makes them and will break them the first moment it may serve his purpose.<ref name=\"Steiner\">Bernard C. Steiner and James McHenry, ''[https://archive.org/details/lifeandcorrespo02steigoog The life and correspondence of James McHenry]'' (Cleveland: Burrows Brothers Co., 1907).</ref></blockquote>\n\nHamilton details the many charges that he has against Burr in a more extensive letter written shortly afterward, calling him a \"profligate, a voluptuary in the extreme\", accusing him of corruptly serving the interests of the [[Holland Land Company]] while a member of the legislature, criticizing his military commission and accusing him of resigning it under false pretenses, and many more serious accusations.<ref name=\"Steiner\"/>\n\n[[File:Morgan Lewis (portrait by Henry Inman).png|thumb|right|[[Morgan Lewis (governor)|Morgan Lewis]], endorsed by Hamilton, defeated Burr in the 1804 New York gubernatorial election.]]\n\nIt became clear that Jefferson would drop Burr from his ticket in the 1804 election, so the Vice President ran for the governorship of New York instead.{{citation needed|date = January 2017}} Hamilton campaigned vigorously against Burr, who was running as an independent, causing him to lose to [[Morgan Lewis (governor)|Morgan Lewis]], a Democratic-Republican endorsed by Hamilton.{{Citation needed|date = January 2017}}\n\nBoth men had been involved in duels in the past. Hamilton had been the second in several duels, although never the duelist himself, but he was involved in more than a dozen affairs of honor<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freeman |first1=Joanne B. |title=Affairs of Honor: National Politics in the New Republic |date=2002 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=326-327}}</ref> prior to his fatal encounter with Burr, including disputes with [[William Gordon (New Hampshire politician)|William Gordon]] (1779), [[Aedanus Burke]] (1790), [[John Francis Mercer]] (1792\u20131793), [[James Nicholson (naval officer)|James Nicholson]] (1795), [[James Monroe]] (1797), and Ebenezer Purdy and [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] (1804). He also served as a second to [[John Laurens]] in a 1779 duel with General [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]], and to legal client John Auldjo in a 1787 duel with [[William Pierce (politician)|William Pierce]].<ref>Freeman, 1996, pp. 294\u2013295.</ref> Hamilton also claimed that he had one previous honor dispute with Burr,<ref>Nathaniel Pendleton to Van Ness.

''Papers of Aaron Burr'', 2: 887.</ref><ref>Additionally, Hamilton's son [[Philip Hamilton|Philip]] was killed in a November 23, 1801, duel with George I. Eacker, initiated after Philip and his friend Richard Price engaged in \"hooliganish\" behavior in Eacker's box at the [[Park Theatre (Manhattan, New York)]]. This was in response to a speech which Eacker had made on July 3, 1801, that was critical of Hamilton. Philip and his friend both challenged Eacker to duels when he called them \"damned rascals\" (Fleming, 1999, pp. 7\u20139). Price's duel (also at Weehawken) resulted in nothing more than four missed shots, and Hamilton advised his son to ''delope'' (throw away his shot). However, both Philip and Eacker stood shotless for a minute after the command \"present\", then Philip leveled his pistol, causing Eacker to fire, mortally wounding Philip and sending his shot awry.</ref>\n\n===Election of 1800===\n{{main|United States presidential election, 1800}}\n\nBurr and Hamilton first came into public opposition during the United States presidential election of 1800. Burr ran for Vice President on the Democratic-Republican ticket, along with Thomas Jefferson, against President John Adams (the Federalist incumbent) and his vice presidential running mate [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney|Charles C. Pinckney]]. Electoral College rules at the time gave each elector two votes for president. The candidate who received the second most votes became vice president.\n\nThe Democratic-Republican Party planned to have 72 of their 73 electors vote for both Jefferson and Burr, with the remaining elector voting only for Jefferson. The electors failed to execute this plan, so Burr and Jefferson were tied with 73 votes each. The Constitution stipulates that if no candidate wins a majority, the election is moved to the House of Representatives\u2014which was controlled by the Federalists, at this point, many of whom were loath to vote for Jefferson. Hamilton regarded Burr as far more dangerous than Jefferson and used all his influence to ensure Jefferson's election. On the 36th ballot, the House of Representatives gave Jefferson the presidency, with Burr becoming Vice President.\n\n===Charles Cooper's letter===\n{{Wikisourcehas|original texts related to|[[s:Hamilton-Burr duel correspondences|Hamilton\u2013Burr duel correspondences]]}}\nOn April 24, 1804, the ''Albany Register'' published a letter opposing Burr's candidacy<ref>Cooper, Charles D.

''Hamilton Papers''.

Van Ness which pointed particularly to the phrase \"more despicable\" and demanded \"a prompt and unqualified acknowledgment or denial of the use of any expression which would warrant the assertion of Dr. Cooper.\" Hamilton's verbose reply on June 20, 1804, indicated that he could not be held responsible for Cooper's interpretation of his words (yet he did not fault that interpretation), concluding that he would \"abide the consequences\" should Burr remain unsatisfied.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-26-02-0001-0205 |title=From Alexander Hamilton to Aaron Burr, 20 June 1804 |website=Founders.archives.gov |date=June 29, 2016 |accessdate=July 9, 2016}}</ref> A recurring theme in their correspondence is that Burr seeks avowal or disavowal of ''anything'' that could justify Cooper's characterization, while Hamilton protests that there are no ''specifics''.\n\nBurr replied on June 21, 1804, also delivered by Van Ness, stating that \"political opposition can never absolve gentlemen from the necessity of a rigid adherence to the laws of honor and the rules of decorum\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-26-02-0001-0207 |title=To Alexander Hamilton from Aaron Burr, 21 June 1804 |website=Founders.archives.gov |date=June 29, 2016 |accessdate=July 9, 2016}}</ref> Hamilton replied that he had \"no other answer to give than that which has already been given\".

General Hamilton cannot recollect distinctly the particulars of that conversation, so as to undertake to repeat them, without running the risk of varying or omitting what might be deemed important circumstances. The expressions are entirely forgotten, and the specific ideas imperfectly remembered; but to the best of his recollection it consisted of comments on the political principles and views of Colonel Burr, and the results that might be expected from them in the event of his election as Governor, without reference to any particular instance of past conduct or private character.<ref>Winfield, 1875, pp. 216\u2013217.</ref>}}\n\nEventually, Burr issued a formal challenge and Hamilton accepted.<ref>Winfield, 1875, p. 217.</ref> Many historians have considered the causes of the duel to be flimsy and have thus characterized Hamilton as \"suicidal\", Burr as \"malicious and murderous\", or both.<ref>Freeman, 1996, p. 290.</ref> Thomas Fleming offers the theory that Burr may have been attempting to recover his honor by challenging Hamilton, whom he considered to be the only gentleman among his detractors, in response to the slanderous attacks against his character published during the 1804 gubernatorial campaign.<ref>Fleming, p. 281</ref>\n\nHamilton's reasons for not engaging in a duel included his roles as father and husband, putting his creditors at risk, and placing his family's welfare in jeopardy, but he felt that it would be impossible to avoid a duel because he had made attacks on Burr which he was unable to recant, and because of Burr's behavior prior to the duel. He attempted to reconcile his moral and religious reasons and the codes of honor and politics. Joanne Freeman speculates that Hamilton intended to accept the duel and throw away his shot in order to satisfy his moral and political codes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dueling as Politics: Reinterpreting the Burr\u2013Hamilton Duel|last=Freeman|first=Joanne|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==The duel==\n[[File:Duel between Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton.jpg|thumb|left|Artistic impression of Burr's shot]]\nIn the early morning of July 11, 1804, Burr and Hamilton departed from Manhattan by separate boats and rowed across the [[Hudson River]] to a spot known as the Heights of [[Weehawken, New Jersey]], a popular dueling ground below the towering cliffs of the [[New Jersey Palisades]].<ref name=\"teachinghistory\">Buescher, John. \"[http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24404 Burr\u2013Hamilton Duel].\" [http://www.teachinghistory.org Teachinghistory.org]. Accessed July 11, 2011.</ref> Dueling had been prohibited in both New York and New Jersey, but Hamilton and Burr agreed to go to Weehawken because New Jersey was not as aggressive as New York in prosecuting dueling participants. The same site was used for 18 known duels between 1700 and 1845, including the 1801 duel that killed Hamilton's eldest son [[Philip Hamilton]].<ref>Demontreux, 2004, p. 3.</ref> They also took steps to give all witnesses plausible deniability in an attempt to shield themselves from prosecution. For example, the pistols were transported to the island in a portmanteau, enabling the rowers to say under oath that they had not seen any pistols. They also stood with their backs to the duelists.<ref>Chernow, p. 700.</ref>\n\nBurr, [[William Peter Van Ness]] (his [[second (duel)|second]]), Matthew L. Davis, another man (often identified as John Swarthout), and the rowers all reached the site at 6:30&nbsp;a.m., whereupon Swarthout and Van Ness started to clear the underbrush from the dueling ground. Hamilton, Judge [[Nathaniel Pendleton]] (his second), and [[David Hosack]] arrived a few minutes before seven. Lots were cast for the choice of position and which second should start the duel. Both were won by Hamilton's second, who chose the upper edge of the ledge for Hamilton, facing the city.<ref name=\"Winfield 219\">Winfield, 1874, p. 219.</ref> However, [[Joseph Ellis]] claims that Hamilton had been challenged and therefore had choice of both weapon and position. Under this account, it was Hamilton himself who chose the upstream or north side position.<ref name=\"Ellis 24\">Ellis, Joseph. Founding Brothers. p. 24</ref>\n\nAll first-hand accounts of the duel agree that two shots were fired, although the seconds disagreed on the intervening time between them. It was common for both principals in a duel to fire a shot at the ground to exemplify courage, and then the duel could come to an end. Hamilton apparently fired a shot above Burr's head. Burr returned fire and hit Hamilton in the lower abdomen above the right hip.<ref name=\"Winfield, 1874, pp. 219\u2013220\">Winfield, 1874, pp. 219\u2013220.</ref> The large-caliber lead ball ricocheted off Hamilton's third or second [[False ribs|false rib]], fracturing it and causing considerable damage to his internal organs, particularly his liver and diaphragm, before lodging in his first or second [[lumbar vertebra]]. According to Pendleton's account, Hamilton collapsed almost immediately, dropping the pistol involuntarily, and Burr moved toward him in a speechless manner (which Pendleton deemed to be indicative of regret) before being hustled away behind an umbrella by Van Ness because Hosack and the rowers were already approaching.<ref name=\"Winfield, 1874, pp. 219\u2013220\"/>\n\nIt is entirely uncertain which principal fired first, as both seconds' backs were to the duel in accordance with the pre-arranged regulations so that they could testify that they \"saw no fire\". After much research to determine the actual events of the duel, historian Joseph Ellis gives his best guess:\n\n{{quote|Hamilton did fire his weapon intentionally, and he fired first. But he aimed to miss Burr, sending his ball into the tree above and behind Burr's location. In so doing, he did not withhold his shot, but he did waste it, thereby honoring his pre-duel pledge. Meanwhile, Burr, who did not know about the pledge, did know that a projectile from Hamilton's gun had whizzed past him and crashed into the tree to his rear. According to the principles of the [[code duello]], Burr was perfectly justified in taking deadly aim at Hamilton and firing to kill.}}\n\n===David Hosack's account===\nHosack wrote his account on August 17, about one month after the duel had taken place. He testified that he had only seen Hamilton and the two seconds disappear \"into the wood\", heard two shots, and rushed to find a wounded Hamilton. He also testified that he had not seen Burr, who had been hidden behind an umbrella by Van Ness.<ref>''William P. Van Ness vs. The People''. 1805.</ref> He gives a very clear picture of the events in a letter to [[William Coleman (editor)|William Coleman]]:\n\n{{quote|When called to him upon his receiving the fatal wound, I found him half sitting on the ground, supported in the arms of Mr. Pendleton. His countenance of death I shall never forget. He had at that instant just strength to say, \"This is a mortal wound, doctor;\" when he sunk away, and became to all appearance lifeless. I immediately stripped up his clothes, and soon, alas I ascertained that the direction of the ball must have been through some vital part. His pulses were not to be felt, his respiration was entirely suspended, and, upon laying my hand on his heart and perceiving no motion there, I considered him as irrecoverably gone. I, however, observed to Mr. Pendleton, that the only chance for his reviving was immediately to get him upon the water. We therefore lifted him up, and carried him out of the wood to the margin of the bank, where the bargemen aided us in conveying him into the boat, which immediately put off. During all this time I could not discover the least symptom of returning life. I now rubbed his face, lips, and temples with [[spirits of hartshorn]], applied it to his neck and breast, and to the wrists and palms of his hands, and endeavoured to pour some into his mouth.<ref name=\"Hosack Coleman\">Dr. David Hosack to William Coleman, August 17, 1804</ref>}}\n\nHosack goes on to say that Hamilton had revived after a few minutes, either from the hartshorn or fresh air. He finishes his letter:\n\n{{quote|Soon after recovering his sight, he happened to cast his eye upon the case of pistols, and observing the one that he had had in his hand lying on the outside, he said, \"Take care of that pistol; it is undischarged, and still cocked; it may go off and do harm. Pendleton knows\" (attempting to turn his head towards him) \"that I did not intend to fire at him.\" \"Yes,\" said Mr. Pendleton, understanding his wish, \"I have already made Dr. Hosack acquainted with your determination as to that.\" He then closed his eyes and remained calm, without any disposition to speak; nor did he say much afterward, except in reply to my questions. He asked me once or twice how I found his pulse; and he informed me that his lower extremities had lost all feeling, manifesting to me that he entertained no hopes that he should long survive.<ref name=\"Hosack Coleman\" />}}\n\n===Statement to the press===\nPendleton and Van Ness issued a press statement about the events of the duel which pointed out the agreed-upon dueling rules and events that transpired. It stated that both participants were free to open fire once they had been given the order to present. After first fire had been given, the opponent's second would count to three, whereupon the opponent would fire or sacrifice his shot.<ref name=\"URL\">{{cite web |url=http://odur.let.rug.nl/~usa/B/hamilton/hamil43.htm |title=Document: Joint statement on the Duel < A Biography of Alexander Hamilton (1755\u20131804) < Biographies < American History From Revolution To Reconstruction and beyond |website=Odur.let.rug.nl |accessdate=July 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402062544/http://odur.let.rug.nl/%7Eusa/B/hamilton/hamil43.htm |archive-date=April 2, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Pendleton and Van Ness disagree as to who fired the first shot, but they concur that both men had fired \"within a few seconds of each other\" (as they must have; neither Pendleton nor Van Ness mentions counting down).<ref name=\"URL\" />\n\nIn Pendleton's amended version of the statement, he and a friend went to the site of the duel the day after Hamilton's death to discover where Hamilton's shot went. The statement reads: \n\n<blockquote>They ascertained that the ball passed through the limb of a cedar tree, at an elevation of about twelve feet and a half, perpendicularly from the ground, between thirteen and fourteen feet from the mark on which General Hamilton stood, and about four feet wide of the direct line between him and Col. Burr, on the right side; he having fallen on the left.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Nathaniel Pendleton's Amended Version of His and William P.

See Freeman, 1996, note 1.</ref> in which he stated that he was \"strongly opposed to the practice of dueling\" for both religious and practical reasons. \"I have resolved,\" it continued, \"if our interview is conducted in the usual manner, and it pleases God to give me the opportunity, to reserve and throw away my first fire, and I have thoughts even of reserving my second fire.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hamilton|first1=Alexander|title=Statement on Impending Duel with Aaron Burr, (28 June \u2013 10 July 1804)|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-26-02-0001-0241|website=Founders Online}}</ref><ref>Hamilton, 1804, 26:278.</ref>\n\nHamilton regained consciousness after being shot and told Dr. Hosack that his gun was still loaded and that \"Pendleton knows I did not mean to fire at him.\" This is evidence for the theory that Hamilton intended not to fire, honoring his pre-duel pledge, and only fired accidentally upon being hit.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Such an intention would have violated the protocol of the ''code duello'' and, when Burr learned of it, he responded: \"Contemptible, if true.\"<ref>Joseph Wheelan, ''Jefferson's Vendetta: The Pursuit of Aaron Burr and the Judiciary'', New York, Carroll & Graf Publishers, 2005, {{ISBN|0-7867-1437-9}}, p. 90</ref> Hamilton could have thrown away his shot by firing into the ground, thus possibly signaling Burr of his purpose.\n\nModern historians have debated to what extent Hamilton's statements and letter represent his true beliefs, and how much of this was a deliberate attempt to permanently ruin Burr if Hamilton were killed. An example of this may be seen in what one historian has considered to be deliberate attempts to provoke Burr on the dueling ground:\n\n{{quote|Hamilton performed a series of deliberately provocative actions to ensure a lethal outcome.

Hamilton made confidential statements against him, such as those enumerated in his letter to Supreme Court Justice Rutledge. In the attachment to that letter, Hamilton argued against Burr's character on numerous scores: he suspected Burr \"on strong grounds of having corruptly served the views of the Holland Company\"; \"his very friends do not insist on his integrity\"; \"he will court and employ able and daring scoundrels\"; he seeks \"Supreme power in his own person\" and \"will in all likelihood attempt a usurpation\", and so forth.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YbnPAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA251 |title=The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine |accessdate=April 20, 2015|year=1900 }}</ref>\n\n===Pistols===\n[[File:Hamilton-Burr pistols.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Wogdon & Barton]] pistols used in the duel]]\n[[File:Philip Hamilton.jpg|thumb|right|[[Philip Hamilton]] was killed in a duel three years before, near the spot of the Burr\u2013Hamilton duel.]]\nThe pistols used in the duel belonged to Hamilton's brother-in-law [[John Barker Church]], who was a business partner of both Hamilton and Burr.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaronburrassociation.org/duel%20description.htm|title=The two boats rowed back to New York City|website=www.aaronburrassociation.org|access-date=March 27, 2018}}</ref> Later legend claimed that these pistols were the same ones used in a 1799 duel between Church and Burr in which neither man was injured.<ref name=Lindsay>{{cite journal |last1=Lindsay |first1=Merrill |title=Pistols Shed Light on Famed Duel |journal=Smithsonian |date=November 1976 |pages=94\u201398 |url=http://www.aaronburrassociation.org/Smithsonian.htm}}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\">Alexander Hamilton, by Ron Chernow, p. 590</ref> Burr, however, wrote in his memoirs that he supplied the pistols for his duel with Church, and that they belonged to him.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burr|first1=Aaron|last2=Davis|first2=Matthew Livingston|title=Memoirs of Aaron Burr: With Miscellaneous Selections from His Correspondence, Volume 1|date=1837|publisher=Harper & Brothers|page=417|url=https://books.google.com/?id=il4SAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA417|accessdate=February 11, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThe [[Wogdon & Barton]] dueling pistols incorporated a [[wiktionary:hair-trigger|hair-trigger]] feature that could be set by the user.<ref name=Lindsay/><ref>For the [[United States Bicentennial]] in 1976, Chase Manhattan allowed the pistols to be removed and lent to the U.S. Bicentennial Society of Richmond.

Railroad tracks were laid directly through the site in 1870, and the boulder was hauled to the top of the Palisades where it remains today.<ref>Demontreux, 2004, p. 5.</ref> An iron fence was built around it in 1874, supplemented by a bust of Hamilton and a plaque. The bust was thrown over the cliff on October 14, 1934, by vandals and the head was never recovered; a new bust was installed on July 12, 1935.<ref>Demontreux, 2004, p. 6.</ref> The plaque was stolen by vandals in the 1980s and an abbreviated version of the text was inscribed on the indentation left in the boulder, which remained until the 1990s when a granite pedestal was added in front of the boulder and the bust was moved to the top of the pedestal.

[[Eliphalet Nott]], the pastor at an Albany church attended by Hamilton's father-in-law, [[Philip Schuyler]], gave a sermon that was soon reprinted, \"A Discourse, Delivered in the North Dutch Church, in the City of Albany, Occasioned by the Ever to be Lamented Death of General Alexander Hamilton, July 29, 1804\". In 1806, [[Lyman Beecher]] delivered an anti-dueling sermon, later reprinted in 1809 by the Anti-Dueling Association of New York.

The musical compresses the timeline for Burr and Hamilton's grievance, depicting Burr's challenge as a result of Hamilton's endorsement of Jefferson rather than the gubernatorial election. In ''Hamilton'', the duel is the penultimate scene, before the show's finale is sung. The result is the same, but Hamilton's actions are different: he aims his pistol at the sky, but it is too late and Burr has fired his shot.\n\nDescendants of Burr and Hamilton held a re-enactment of the duel near the Hudson River for the duel's bicentennial in 2004.

She was about an hour into her departure to start a cruise when she hit a rock. She was stuck on the rock and repeated attempts to free her were unsuccessful. As the tide ebbed yards were deployed to prevent her healing over, and anchors too with the intent of kedging her off once the tide returned. At the same time boats from other vessels came and took off her stores, guns, and ammunition. Lastly, her crew cut away her masts. As the tide returned it still proved impossible to free her and she started filling with water. Boats took off her crew and by 4pm she had disappeared beneath the water.{{sfnp|Hepper|1994|p=112}}\n\nThe court martial of Smith, his officers, and crew took place in Portsmouth ten days later.
