CD players were first sold to consumers in 1982. CDs typically contain recordings of audio material such as music or [[audiobook]]s. CD players may be part of home [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] systems, [[car audio]] systems, [[personal computer]]s, or [[portable CD player]]s such as CD [[boombox]]es. Most CD players produce an output signal via a [[headphone]] jack or [[RCA jack]]s. To use a CD player in a home stereo system, the user connects an RCA cable from the RCA jacks to a [[hi-fi]] (or other [[power amplifier|amplifier]]) and [[loudspeaker]]s for listening to music.  To listen to music using a CD player with a headphone output jack, the user plugs headphones or earphones into the headphone jack. \n\nModern units can play audio formats other than the original CD [[Pulse Code Modulation|PCM]] audio coding, such as [[MP3]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] and [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]]. [[DJ]]s playing [[dance music]] at clubs often use specialized players with an adjustable playback speed to alter the [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] and tempo of the music. [[Audio engineer]]s using CD players to play music for an event through a [[sound reinforcement system]] use professional audio-grade CD players. CD playback functionality is also available on CD-ROM/DVD-ROM drive equipped computers as well as on [[DVD player]]s and most optical disc-based [[game console]]s.\n\n==History==\n[[File:CDP101a.jpg|thumb|[[Sony CDP-101]], from 1982, the first commercially released [[CD]] player for [[consumer]]s]]\n[[File:JVC CD player.JPG|thumb|right|A [[JVC]] FS-SD5R CD player from the 1990s with a transparent plastic cover]]\nAmerican inventor [[James Russell (inventor)|James T.

Other newer video formats such as [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] use the same physical geometry as CD, and most DVD and Blu-ray players are [[backward compatible]] with audio CD.\n\nBy the early 2000s, the CD player had largely replaced the [[Compact Cassette|audio cassette]] player as standard equipment in new automobiles, with 2010 being the final model year for any car in the US to have a factory-equipped cassette player.<ref name=nyt20120718>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/automobiles/06AUDIO.html|title=For Car Cassette Decks, Play Time Is Over|last=Williams|first=Stephen|newspaper=New York Times|date=4 February 2011|accessdate=18 July 2012 }}</ref> Currently, with the increasing popularity of portable digital audio players, such as mobile phones, and solid state music storage, CD players are being phased out of automobiles in favor of minijack auxiliary inputs and connections to USB devices.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nSome CD players incorporate disc changers.

As of 2020, compact cassettes, vinyl records, and CDs are still being released by some musicians, primarily as merchandise, to allow fans to provide financial support while receiving something tangible in return.\n\n==Inner workings==\nThe process of playing an audio CD, touted as a digital audio storage medium, starts with the plastic polycarbonate compact disc, a medium that contains the digitally encoded data. The disc is placed in a tray which either opens up (as with portable CD players) or slides out (the norm with in-home CD players, computer disc drives and game consoles). In some systems, the user slides the disc into a slot (e.g., car stereo CD players). Once the disc is loaded into the tray, the data is read out by a mechanism that scans the spiral data track using a [[laser]] beam. An electric motor spins the disc. The tracking control is done by analogue servoamplifiers and then the high frequency analogue signal read from the disc is digitized, processed and decoded into analogue audio and digital control data which is used by the player to position the playback mechanism on the correct track, do the skip and seek functions and display track, time, index and, on newer players in the 2010s, display title and artist information on a display placed in the front panel.<ref>ISO/IEC Standard 60908</ref>\n\n===Analogue signal recovery from the disc===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\n[[File:Philips RAFOC CD Optical tracking device..png|thumb|Photodiode array on the Philips RAFOC single-beam tracking optical device used in many CDM optical assemblies]]\nTo read the data from the disc, a laser beam shines on the surface of the disc. Surface differences between discs being played, and tiny position differences once loaded, are handled by using a movable lens with a very close focal length to focus the light on the disc. A low mass lens coupled to an electromagnetic coil is in charge of keeping focused the beam on the 600&nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]] wide data track.\n\nWhen the player tries to read from a stop, it first does a focus seek program that moves the lens up and down from the surface of the disc until a reflection is detected; when there is a reflection, the servo electronics lock in place keeping the lens in perfect focus while the disc rotates and changes its relative height from the optical block.\n\nDifferent brands and models of optical assemblies use different methods of focus detection. On most players, the focus position detection is made using the difference in the current output of a block of four photodiodes. The photodiode block and the optics are arranged in such a way that a perfect focus projects a circular pattern on the block while a far or near focus projects an ellipse differing in the position of the long edge in north-south or west-southwest. That difference is the information that the servoamplifier uses to keep the lens at the proper reading distance during the playback operation, even if the disc is warped.<ref>Egon Strauss - Compact Disc, Digital storage medium, Ed. Quark 1998</ref>\n\nAnother servo mechanism in the player is in charge of keeping the focused beam centered on the data track.\n\nTwo optical pick-up designs exists, the original CDM series from Philips use a magnetic actuator mounted on a swing-arm to do coarse and fine tracking. Using only one laser beam and the 4 photodiode block, the servo knows if the track is centred by measuring side-by-side movement of the light of beam hitting on the block and corrects to keep the light on the centre.\n\nThe other design by Sony uses a diffraction grating to part the laser light into one main beam and two sub-beams. When focused, the two peripheral beams cover the border of the adjacent tracks a few [[micrometre|micrometer]]s apart from the main beam and reflect back on two photodiodes separated from the main block of four. The servo detects the RF signal being received on the peripheral receivers and the difference in output between these two diodes conform the tracking error signal that the system uses to keep the optics in the proper track. The tracking signal is fed to two systems, one integrated in the focus lens assembly can do fine tracking correction and the other system can move the entire optical assembly side by side to do coarse track jumps.\n\nThe sum of the output from the four photodiodes makes the RF or high frequency signal which is an electronic mirror of the pits and lands recorded on the disc. The RF signal, when observed on an oscilloscope, has a characteristic \"fish-eye\" pattern and its usefulness in servicing the machine is paramount for detecting and diagnosing problems, and calibrating CD players for operation.\n\n===Digital signal processing===\nThe first stage in the processing chain for the analog RF signal (from the photoreceptor device) is digitizing it. Using various circuits like a simple comparator or a data slicer, the analog signal becomes a chain of two binary digital values, 1 and 0. This signal carries all the information in a CD and is modulated using a system called [[Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation|EFM]] (Eight-to-fourteen modulation). The second stage is demodulating the EFM signal into a data frame that contains the audio samples, error correction parity bits, according with the [[Cross-interleaved Reed-Solomon coding|CIRC]] error correction code, and control data for the player display and micro-computer.\nThe EFM demodulator also decodes part of the CD signal and routes it to the proper circuits, separating audio, parity and control (subcode) data.\n\nAfter demodulating, a CIRC error corrector takes each audio data frame, stores it in a [[Shadow Random Access Memory|SRAM]] memory and verifies that it has been read correctly, if it is not, it takes the parity and correction bits and fixes the data, then it moves it out to a [[Digital-to-analog converter|DAC]] to be converted to an analog audio signal. If the data missing is enough to make recovery impossible, the correction is made by interpolating the data from subsequent frames so the missing part is not noticed. Each player has a different interpolation ability. If too many data frames are missing or unrecoverable, the audio signal may be impossible to fix by interpolation, so an audio mute flag is raised to mute the DAC to avoid invalid data to be played back.\n\nThe Redbook standard dictates that, if there is invalid, erroneous or missing audio data, it cannot be output to the speakers as digital noise, it has to be muted.\n\n===Player control===\nThe Audio CD format requires every player to have enough processing power to decode the CD data; this is normally made by application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). ASICs do not work by themselves, however; they require a main microcomputer or [[microcontroller]] to orchestrate the entire machine.\n\n==Tray design types==\n\n===Tray loading===\n[[File:Vintagedenon.jpg|thumb|250px|A 1980s-era [[Denon]] CD player with the chassis cover removed to show the electronic and mechanical components.]]\n\n[[Sony]] released its [[Sony CDP-101|CDP-101]] CD player<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cedmagic.com/history/sony-dp-101.html | title = CDP-101 The first Compact Disc Audio CD Player from 1982 | language =  | accessdate = 2007-02-05 | year = 2007 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> in 1982 with a slide-out tray design for the CD.

Although the Sony prototype design was never put into volume production, the concept was for a time adopted for production by a number of early Japanese CD player manufacturers, including [[Luxman|Alpine/Luxman]], [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]] under the [[Technics (brand)|Technics]] brand, [[Kenwood Corporation|Kenwood]] and [[Toshiba|Toshiba/Aurex]]. For the early vertical loading players, Alpine sourced their AD-7100 player designs for Luxman,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thevintageknob.org/DAD/DX104/DX104.html | title = Luxman DX-104 CD Player | language = | accessdate = 2007-02-17 | year = 2007}}</ref> Kenwood and Toshiba (using their Aurex brand).

The holder is closed manually by hand, by motor after pressing a button, or completely automatically. Some CD players combine vertical loading with slot loading due the disc being drawn further into the disc holder as it closes.\n\n===Top loading===\n[[File:Philips CD 100.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Philips CD100 Player]]\n\nIn 1983 [[Philips]], at the US and European launch of the CD format, showcased the first top loading CD tray designs with their CD100 CD player.<ref>[http://www.marantzphilips.nl/philips_cd100_first_cdplayer/ Philips CD100 Player\"] - Marantz-Philips Nederlands website</ref><ref>[http://www.research.philips.com/technologies/projects/cd/introduction.html \"The history of the CD - The introduction\"], Philips Research.</ref> (Philips audio products were sold as [[Magnavox]] in the US at the time.) The design had a clamp on the lid which meant the user had to close this over the CD when it was placed inside the machine. Later, [[Meridian Audio, Ltd.|Meridian]] introduced their MCD \"high end\" CD player,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meridian-audio.com/p_cd_history.htm |title=Meridian CD History |accessdate=2007-02-05 |year=2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204043147/http://www.meridian-audio.com/p_cd_history.htm |archivedate=2007-02-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> with Meridian electronics in the Philips CD100 chassis.\n\nTop-loading was adopted on various equipment designs such as mini systems and portable CD players, but among stereo component CD players, only a handful of top-loading models have been made.

They more closely mimic the physical arrangement and ergonomics of record turntables used in those applications.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Tray loading with sliding mechanism===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nThe Philips CD303 of 1983-1984 was the first player to adopt tray loading with a sliding play mechanism. Basically as the tray came out to collect the CD, the entire player's transport system also came out as one unit. The [[Meridian Audio, Ltd.|Meridian]]s 200 and 203 players were of this type. They were also the first to use a design in which the audio electronics were in a separate enclosure from the CD drive and pickup mechanism. A similar mechanism is used in slim optical disc drives (also known as slim internal DVD drive, optical drive or DVD burner),  which were once commonly used in laptop computers.\n\n===Slot loading===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nSlot loading is the preferred loading mechanism for car audio players. There is no tray that pops out, and a motor is used to assist disc insertion and removal. Some slot-loading mechanisms and changers can load and play back [[Mini CD|Mini-CDs]] without the need of an adapter but they may work with limited functionality (A disc changer will refuse to operate the changer until the Mini CD is removed for example).\n[[Shaped Compact Disc|Non-circular CDs]] cannot be used on such loaders because they cannot handle non-circular discs. When inserted, such discs may become stuck and damage the mechanism. It is also used on some laptop computers, the [[PlayStation 3 models|Playstation 3 original and Playstation 3 Slim]], all variants of the [[PlayStation 4]], in the [[Wii]] and [[Wii U]], and in the [[Xbox One]].\n\n==Pickup mechanisms==\n[[File:Optical Deck Bottom.jpg|thumb|left|Underside view showing a radial-type tracking mechanism with screw drive]]\n[[File:Philips CDM4 Swing Arm CD mechanism.jpg|thumb|Philips swing arm optical mechanism]]\n[[File:cdchip.jpg|thumb|The optical chip extracted from a CD player. The three dark rectangles are photosensitive, read the data from the disk and keep the beam focused. Electronic tracking, aided with the two photodiodes at the sides, keeps the laser beam centered on the middle of the data track.]]\nTwo types of optical tracking mechanisms exist:\n* The '''swing-arm mechanism''', originally designed by Philips<ref>{{cite web|url=http://siber-sonic.com/audio/swingarm.html |title=Swing-arm mechanism description |publisher=Siber-sonic.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}</ref>&nbsp;\u2013 the lens moves at the end of an arm, in a manner similar to the tone arm assembly of a [[Phonograph|record player]]. Used in earliest Philips CD players and later replaced with cheaper radial mechanisms.\n* The '''radial mechanism''', designed by Sony, which is the one used in most CD players in the 2000s \u2013 the lens moves on a radial rail being driven by a rotating gear from a motor or a linear magnetic assembly. The motor or linear magnetic assembly consists of a solenoid mounted to the moving laser assembly, wound over a permanent magnetic field attached to the base of the mechanism. It is also known as three-beam linear tracking.\n[[File:Philips 1 beam tracking Laser Optical Assembly.jpg|thumb|left|Philips one-beam laser assembly]]\nThe swing-arm mechanism has a distinctive advantage over the other in that it does not \"skip\" when the rail becomes dirty. The swing arm mechanisms tend to have a much longer life than their radial counterparts.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} The main difference between the two mechanisms is the way they read the data from the disc. The swing-arm mechanism uses a magnetic coil wound over a permanent magnet to provide the tracking movement to the laser assembly in a similar way a [[hard drive]] moves its head across the data tracks. It also uses another magnetic movement mechanism attached to the focusing lens to focus the laser beam on the disc surface. By operating the tracking or the focus actuators, the laser beam can be positioned on any part of the disc.\nThis mechanism employs a single laser beam and a set of four photodiodes to read, focus and keep track of the data coming from the disc.<ref>Philips CD100 Service Manual</ref>\n\n[[File:CD Player focusing lens assembly.jpg|thumb|left|Sharp laser optical assembly. All six focusing and tracking coils can be seen.]]\nThe linear tracking mechanism uses a motor and reduction gears to move the laser assembly radially across the tracks of the disc and it also has a set of six coils mounted in the focusing lens over a permanent magnetic field. One set of two coils moves the lens closer to the disc surface, providing the focusing motion, and the other set of coils moves the lens radially, providing a finer tracking motion. This mechanism uses the three-beam tracking method in which a main laser beam is used to read and focus the data track of the disc using three or four photodiodes, depending on the focus method, and two smaller beams read the adjacent tracks at each side to help the servo keep the tracking using two more \"helper\" [[photodiode]]s.<ref>Sony CDP-101 Service Manual</ref>\n\n==Mechanical components==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\n[[File:Dismantled Philips EXP2582 portable CD player.jpg|thumb|[[Philips]] Portable CD player disassembled]]\nA CD player has three major mechanical components : a '''drive motor''', a '''[[lens (optics)|lens]] system''' or pickup head, and a '''tracking mechanism'''.\nThe drive motor (also called spindle) spins the disc to a scanning velocity of 1.2\u20131.4&nbsp;m/s ([[constant linear velocity]]) \u2013 equivalent to approximately 500 RPM at the inside of the disc, and approximately 200 RPM at the outside edge. (A disc played from beginning to end slows its rotation rate during playback.) The tracking mechanism moves the lens system along the spiral tracks in which information is encoded, and the lens assembly reads the information using a [[laser beam]], typically produced by a [[laser diode]]. The laser reads information by focusing a beam on the CD, which is reflected off the disc's mirrored surface back to a [[photodiode]] array sensor. The sensor detects changes in the beam, and a digital processing chain interprets these changes as binary data. The data are processed, and eventually converted to [[sound]] using a [[digital-to-analog converter]] (DAC).\n\nA TOC or Table of Contents is located after the \"lead-in\" area of the disc, which is located in an inner ring of the disc, and contains roughly five kilobytes of available space. It is the first information that the player reads when the disc is loaded in the player and contains information on the total number of audio tracks, the running time on the CD, the running time of each track, and other information such as ISRC and the format structure of the disc. The TOC is of such vital importance for the disc that if it is not read correctly by the player, the CD could not be played back. That is why it is repeated 3 times before the first music program starts. The \"lead out\" area in the end (the outer peripheral) of the disc tells the player that disc has come to an end.\n\n==CD player features==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nCD players can employ a number of ways to improve performance, or reduce component count or price. Features such as oversampling, one-bit DACs, dual DACs, interpolation (error correction), anti-skip buffering, digital and optical outputs are, or were, likely to be found. Other features improve functionality, such as track programming, random play and repeat, or direct track access. Yet others are related to the CD player's intended target, such as anti-skip for car and portable CD players, pitch control and queuing for a DJ's CD player, remote and system integration for household players. Description of some features follows:\n\n*''[[Oversampling]]'' is a way to improve the performance of the low pass filter present at the output of most CD players. By using a higher sampling frequency, a multiple of the 44.1&nbsp;kHz used by CD encoding, it can employ a filter with much lower requirements.\n*''[[Delta-sigma modulation#Digital to analog conversion|One-bit DACs]]'' were less expensive than other types of DACs, while providing similar performance.\n*''Dual DACs'' were sometimes advertised as a feature because some of the early CD players used a single DAC, and switched it between channels. This required additional supporting circuits, possibly degrading sound quality.\n*''Anti-skip or Antishock'', is a way for the CD player to avoid interrupting the audio output when mechanical shock is experienced by the disc playback mechanism. It consists of an additional data processor and a [[RAM chip]] installed on the player that reads the disc at double speed and stores various frames of audio data in a RAM [[memory buffer]] for later decoding. Some players may compress the audio data prior to buffering to use lower capacity (and less expensive) RAM chips. Typical players can store about 44 seconds of audio data on a 16 mbit RAM chip.\n\n==Portable CD players==\n\n===Small portable players===\n[[File:Discman D121.jpg|thumb|upright|An early portable player, a [[Sony]] [[Discman]] model D-121]]\nA [[portable CD player]] is a [[portable audio player]] used to play [[compact disc]]s.

Beginning in the 1990s, boomboxes typically included a CD player. The boombox CD player is the only type of CD player which produces sound audible by the listener independently, without the need for [[headphones]] or an additional amplifier or speaker system. Designed for portability, boomboxes can be powered by [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] as well as by line current. The boombox was introduced to the American market during the mid-1970s. The desire for louder and heavier bass led to bigger and heavier boxes; by the 1980s, some boomboxes had reached the size of a [[suitcase]]. Most boomboxes were battery-operated, leading to extremely heavy, bulky boxes.<ref name=npr>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2009/04/22/103363836/a-eulogy-for-the-boombox|title=A Eulogy For The Boombox|date=22 April 2009|work=NPR.org|first=Frannie|last=Kelly|accessdate=November 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nMost boomboxes from the 2010s typically include a CD player compatible with [[CD-R]] and [[CD-RW]], which allows the user to carry their own music compilations on a higher fidelity medium.

CD players were first sold to consumers in 1982. CDs typically contain recordings of audio material such as music or [[audiobook]]s. CD players may be part of home [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] systems, [[car audio]] systems, [[personal computer]]s, or [[portable CD player]]s such as CD [[boombox]]es. Most CD players produce an output signal via a [[headphone]] jack or [[RCA jack]]s. To use a CD player in a home stereo system, the user connects an RCA cable from the RCA jacks to a [[hi-fi]] (or other [[power amplifier|amplifier]]) and [[loudspeaker]]s for listening to music.  To listen to music using a CD player with a headphone output jack, the user plugs headphones or earphones into the headphone jack. \n\nModern units can play audio formats other than the original CD [[Pulse Code Modulation|PCM]] audio coding, such as [[MP3]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] and [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]]. [[DJ]]s playing [[dance music]] at clubs often use specialized players with an adjustable playback speed to alter the [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] and tempo of the music. [[Audio engineer]]s using CD players to play music for an event through a [[sound reinforcement system]] use professional audio-grade CD players.

Other newer video formats such as [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] use the same physical geometry as CD, and most DVD and Blu-ray players are [[backward compatible]] with audio CD.\n\nBy the early 2000s, the CD player had largely replaced the [[Compact Cassette|audio cassette]] player as standard equipment in new automobiles, with 2010 being the final model year for any car in the US to have a factory-equipped cassette player.<ref name=nyt20120718>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/automobiles/06AUDIO.html|title=For Car Cassette Decks, Play Time Is Over|last=Williams|first=Stephen|newspaper=New York Times|date=4 February 2011|accessdate=18 July 2012 }}</ref> Currently, with the increasing popularity of portable digital audio players, such as mobile phones, and solid state music storage, CD players are being phased out of automobiles in favor of minijack auxiliary inputs and connections to USB devices.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nSome CD players incorporate disc changers.

As of 2020, compact cassettes, vinyl records, and CDs are still being released by some musicians, primarily as merchandise, to allow fans to provide financial support while receiving something tangible in return.\n\n==Inner workings==\nThe process of playing an audio CD, touted as a digital audio storage medium, starts with the plastic polycarbonate compact disc, a medium that contains the digitally encoded data. The disc is placed in a tray which either opens up (as with portable CD players) or slides out (the norm with in-home CD players, computer disc drives and game consoles). In some systems, the user slides the disc into a slot (e.g., car stereo CD players). Once the disc is loaded into the tray, the data is read out by a mechanism that scans the spiral data track using a [[laser]] beam. An electric motor spins the disc. The tracking control is done by analogue servoamplifiers and then the high frequency analogue signal read from the disc is digitized, processed and decoded into analogue audio and digital control data which is used by the player to position the playback mechanism on the correct track, do the skip and seek functions and display track, time, index and, on newer players in the 2010s, display title and artist information on a display placed in the front panel.<ref>ISO/IEC Standard 60908</ref>\n\n===Analogue signal recovery from the disc===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\n[[File:Philips RAFOC CD Optical tracking device..png|thumb|Photodiode array on the Philips RAFOC single-beam tracking optical device used in many CDM optical assemblies]]\nTo read the data from the disc, a laser beam shines on the surface of the disc. Surface differences between discs being played, and tiny position differences once loaded, are handled by using a movable lens with a very close focal length to focus the light on the disc. A low mass lens coupled to an electromagnetic coil is in charge of keeping focused the beam on the 600&nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]] wide data track.\n\nWhen the player tries to read from a stop, it first does a focus seek program that moves the lens up and down from the surface of the disc until a reflection is detected; when there is a reflection, the servo electronics lock in place keeping the lens in perfect focus while the disc rotates and changes its relative height from the optical block.\n\nDifferent brands and models of optical assemblies use different methods of focus detection. On most players, the focus position detection is made using the difference in the current output of a block of four photodiodes. The photodiode block and the optics are arranged in such a way that a perfect focus projects a circular pattern on the block while a far or near focus projects an ellipse differing in the position of the long edge in north-south or west-southwest. That difference is the information that the servoamplifier uses to keep the lens at the proper reading distance during the playback operation, even if the disc is warped.<ref>Egon Strauss - Compact Disc, Digital storage medium, Ed. Quark 1998</ref>\n\nAnother servo mechanism in the player is in charge of keeping the focused beam centered on the data track.\n\nTwo optical pick-up designs exists, the original CDM series from Philips use a magnetic actuator mounted on a swing-arm to do coarse and fine tracking. Using only one laser beam and the 4 photodiode block, the servo knows if the track is centred by measuring side-by-side movement of the light of beam hitting on the block and corrects to keep the light on the centre.\n\nThe other design by Sony uses a diffraction grating to part the laser light into one main beam and two sub-beams. When focused, the two peripheral beams cover the border of the adjacent tracks a few [[micrometre|micrometer]]s apart from the main beam and reflect back on two photodiodes separated from the main block of four. The servo detects the RF signal being received on the peripheral receivers and the difference in output between these two diodes conform the tracking error signal that the system uses to keep the optics in the proper track. The tracking signal is fed to two systems, one integrated in the focus lens assembly can do fine tracking correction and the other system can move the entire optical assembly side by side to do coarse track jumps.\n\nThe sum of the output from the four photodiodes makes the RF or high frequency signal which is an electronic mirror of the pits and lands recorded on the disc. The RF signal, when observed on an oscilloscope, has a characteristic \"fish-eye\" pattern and its usefulness in servicing the machine is paramount for detecting and diagnosing problems, and calibrating CD players for operation.\n\n===Digital signal processing===\nThe first stage in the processing chain for the analog RF signal (from the photoreceptor device) is digitizing it. Using various circuits like a simple comparator or a data slicer, the analog signal becomes a chain of two binary digital values, 1 and 0. This signal carries all the information in a CD and is modulated using a system called [[Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation|EFM]] (Eight-to-fourteen modulation). The second stage is demodulating the EFM signal into a data frame that contains the audio samples, error correction parity bits, according with the [[Cross-interleaved Reed-Solomon coding|CIRC]] error correction code, and control data for the player display and micro-computer.\nThe EFM demodulator also decodes part of the CD signal and routes it to the proper circuits, separating audio, parity and control (subcode) data.\n\nAfter demodulating, a CIRC error corrector takes each audio data frame, stores it in a [[Shadow Random Access Memory|SRAM]] memory and verifies that it has been read correctly, if it is not, it takes the parity and correction bits and fixes the data, then it moves it out to a [[Digital-to-analog converter|DAC]] to be converted to an analog audio signal. If the data missing is enough to make recovery impossible, the correction is made by interpolating the data from subsequent frames so the missing part is not noticed. Each player has a different interpolation ability. If too many data frames are missing or unrecoverable, the audio signal may be impossible to fix by interpolation, so an audio mute flag is raised to mute the DAC to avoid invalid data to be played back.\n\nThe Redbook standard dictates that, if there is invalid, erroneous or missing audio data, it cannot be output to the speakers as digital noise, it has to be muted.\n\n===Player control===\nThe Audio CD format requires every player to have enough processing power to decode the CD data; this is normally made by application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). ASICs do not work by themselves, however; they require a main microcomputer or [[microcontroller]] to orchestrate the entire machine.\n\n==Tray design types==\n\n===Tray loading===\n[[File:Vintagedenon.jpg|thumb|250px|A 1980s-era [[Denon]] CD player with the chassis cover removed to show the electronic and mechanical components.]]\n\n[[Sony]] released its [[Sony CDP-101|CDP-101]] CD player<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cedmagic.com/history/sony-dp-101.html | title = CDP-101 The first Compact Disc Audio CD Player from 1982 | language =  | accessdate = 2007-02-05 | year = 2007 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> in 1982 with a slide-out tray design for the CD.

Later, [[Meridian Audio, Ltd.|Meridian]] introduced their MCD \"high end\" CD player,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meridian-audio.com/p_cd_history.htm |title=Meridian CD History |accessdate=2007-02-05 |year=2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204043147/http://www.meridian-audio.com/p_cd_history.htm |archivedate=2007-02-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> with Meridian electronics in the Philips CD100 chassis.\n\nTop-loading was adopted on various equipment designs such as mini systems and portable CD players, but among stereo component CD players, only a handful of top-loading models have been made. Examples include [[Luxman]]'s D-500 and D-500X series<ref>{{cite web | url = http://k-nisi.hp.infoseek.co.jp/d-500-xs.html | title = Luxman D-500X (in Japanese) | language =  | accessdate = 2007-02-05 | year = 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070717004455/http://k-nisi.hp.infoseek.co.jp/d-500-xs.html | archive-date = 2007-07-17 | url-status = dead }}</ref> players and [[Denon]]'s DP-S1,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://denon.jp/museum/products/dps1.html | title = Denon Museum - Model History - 1993 - DP-S1 (in Japanese) | accessdate = 2007-02-05 | year = 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070204103139/http://denon.jp/museum/products/dps1.html | archive-date = 2007-02-04 | url-status = dead }}</ref> both launched in 1993.\nTop-loading is also common in players intended for broadcast and live sound \"DJ\" use, such as Technics' SL-P50 (1984\u20131985) and Technics SL-P1200 (1986\u20131992). They more closely mimic the physical arrangement and ergonomics of record turntables used in those applications.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Tray loading with sliding mechanism===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nThe Philips CD303 of 1983-1984 was the first player to adopt tray loading with a sliding play mechanism. Basically as the tray came out to collect the CD, the entire player's transport system also came out as one unit. The [[Meridian Audio, Ltd.|Meridian]]s 200 and 203 players were of this type. They were also the first to use a design in which the audio electronics were in a separate enclosure from the CD drive and pickup mechanism. A similar mechanism is used in slim optical disc drives (also known as slim internal DVD drive, optical drive or DVD burner),  which were once commonly used in laptop computers.\n\n===Slot loading===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nSlot loading is the preferred loading mechanism for car audio players. There is no tray that pops out, and a motor is used to assist disc insertion and removal. Some slot-loading mechanisms and changers can load and play back [[Mini CD|Mini-CDs]] without the need of an adapter but they may work with limited functionality (A disc changer will refuse to operate the changer until the Mini CD is removed for example).\n[[Shaped Compact Disc|Non-circular CDs]] cannot be used on such loaders because they cannot handle non-circular discs. When inserted, such discs may become stuck and damage the mechanism. It is also used on some laptop computers, the [[PlayStation 3 models|Playstation 3 original and Playstation 3 Slim]], all variants of the [[Playstation 4]], in the [[Wii]] and [[Wii U]], and in the [[Xbox One]].\n\n==Pickup mechanisms==\n[[File:Optical Deck Bottom.jpg|thumb|left|Underside view showing a radial-type tracking mechanism with screw drive]]\n[[File:Philips CDM4 Swing Arm CD mechanism.jpg|thumb|Philips swing arm optical mechanism]]\n[[File:cdchip.jpg|thumb|The optical chip extracted from a CD player. The three dark rectangles are photosensitive, read the data from the disk and keep the beam focused. Electronic tracking, aided with the two photodiodes at the sides, keeps the laser beam centered on the middle of the data track.]]\nTwo types of optical tracking mechanisms exist:\n* The '''swing-arm mechanism''', originally designed by Philips<ref>{{cite web|url=http://siber-sonic.com/audio/swingarm.html |title=Swing-arm mechanism description |publisher=Siber-sonic.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}</ref>&nbsp;\u2013 the lens moves at the end of an arm, in a manner similar to the tone arm assembly of a [[Phonograph|record player]]. Used in earliest Philips CD players and later replaced with cheaper radial mechanisms.\n* The '''radial mechanism''', designed by Sony, which is the one used in most CD players in the 2000s \u2013 the lens moves on a radial rail being driven by a rotating gear from a motor or a linear magnetic assembly. The motor or linear magnetic assembly consists of a solenoid mounted to the moving laser assembly, wound over a permanent magnetic field attached to the base of the mechanism. It is also known as three-beam linear tracking.\n[[File:Philips 1 beam tracking Laser Optical Assembly.jpg|thumb|left|Philips one-beam laser assembly]]\nThe swing-arm mechanism has a distinctive advantage over the other in that it does not \"skip\" when the rail becomes dirty. The swing arm mechanisms tend to have a much longer life than their radial counterparts.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} The main difference between the two mechanisms is the way they read the data from the disc. The swing-arm mechanism uses a magnetic coil wound over a permanent magnet to provide the tracking movement to the laser assembly in a similar way a [[hard drive]] moves its head across the data tracks. It also uses another magnetic movement mechanism attached to the focusing lens to focus the laser beam on the disc surface. By operating the tracking or the focus actuators, the laser beam can be positioned on any part of the disc.\nThis mechanism employs a single laser beam and a set of four photodiodes to read, focus and keep track of the data coming from the disc.<ref>Philips CD100 Service Manual</ref>\n\n[[File:CD Player focusing lens assembly.jpg|thumb|left|Sharp laser optical assembly. All six focusing and tracking coils can be seen.]]\nThe linear tracking mechanism uses a motor and reduction gears to move the laser assembly radially across the tracks of the disc and it also has a set of six coils mounted in the focusing lens over a permanent magnetic field. One set of two coils moves the lens closer to the disc surface, providing the focusing motion, and the other set of coils moves the lens radially, providing a finer tracking motion. This mechanism uses the three-beam tracking method in which a main laser beam is used to read and focus the data track of the disc using three or four photodiodes, depending on the focus method, and two smaller beams read the adjacent tracks at each side to help the servo keep the tracking using two more \"helper\" [[photodiode]]s.<ref>Sony CDP-101 Service Manual</ref>\n\n==Mechanical components==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\n[[File:Dismantled Philips EXP2582 portable CD player.jpg|thumb|[[Philips]] Portable CD player disassembled]]\nA CD player has three major mechanical components : a '''drive motor''', a '''[[lens (optics)|lens]] system''' or pickup head, and a '''tracking mechanism'''.\nThe drive motor (also called spindle) spins the disc to a scanning velocity of 1.2\u20131.4&nbsp;m/s ([[constant linear velocity]]) \u2013 equivalent to approximately 500 RPM at the inside of the disc, and approximately 200 RPM at the outside edge. (A disc played from beginning to end slows its rotation rate during playback.) The tracking mechanism moves the lens system along the spiral tracks in which information is encoded, and the lens assembly reads the information using a [[laser beam]], typically produced by a [[laser diode]]. The laser reads information by focusing a beam on the CD, which is reflected off the disc's mirrored surface back to a [[photodiode]] array sensor. The sensor detects changes in the beam, and a digital processing chain interprets these changes as binary data. The data are processed, and eventually converted to [[sound]] using a [[digital-to-analog converter]] (DAC).\n\nA TOC or Table of Contents is located after the \"lead-in\" area of the disc, which is located in an inner ring of the disc, and contains roughly five kilobytes of available space. It is the first information that the player reads when the disc is loaded in the player and contains information on the total number of audio tracks, the running time on the CD, the running time of each track, and other information such as ISRC and the format structure of the disc. The TOC is of such vital importance for the disc that if it is not read correctly by the player, the CD could not be played back. That is why it is repeated 3 times before the first music program starts. The \"lead out\" area in the end (the outer peripheral) of the disc tells the player that disc has come to an end.\n\n==CD player features==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nCD players can employ a number of ways to improve performance, or reduce component count or price. Features such as oversampling, one-bit DACs, dual DACs, interpolation (error correction), anti-skip buffering, digital and optical outputs are, or were, likely to be found. Other features improve functionality, such as track programming, random play and repeat, or direct track access. Yet others are related to the CD player's intended target, such as anti-skip for car and portable CD players, pitch control and queuing for a DJ's CD player, remote and system integration for household players. Description of some features follows:\n\n*''[[Oversampling]]'' is a way to improve the performance of the low pass filter present at the output of most CD players. By using a higher sampling frequency, a multiple of the 44.1&nbsp;kHz used by CD encoding, it can employ a filter with much lower requirements.\n*''[[Delta-sigma modulation#Digital to analog conversion|One-bit DACs]]'' were less expensive than other types of DACs, while providing similar performance.\n*''Dual DACs'' were sometimes advertised as a feature because some of the early CD players used a single DAC, and switched it between channels. This required additional supporting circuits, possibly degrading sound quality.\n*''Anti-skip or Antishock'', is a way for the CD player to avoid interrupting the audio output when mechanical shock is experienced by the disc playback mechanism. It consists of an additional data processor and a [[RAM chip]] installed on the player that reads the disc at double speed and stores various frames of audio data in a RAM [[memory buffer]] for later decoding. Some players may compress the audio data prior to buffering to use lower capacity (and less expensive) RAM chips. Typical players can store about 44 seconds of audio data on a 16 mbit RAM chip.\n\n==Portable CD players==\n\n===Small portable players===\n[[File:Discman D121.jpg|thumb|upright|An early portable player, a [[Sony]] [[Discman]] model D-121]]\nA [[portable CD player]] is a [[portable audio player]] used to play [[compact disc]]s.

Beginning in the 1990s, boomboxes typically included a CD player. The boombox CD player is the only type of CD player which produces sound audible by the listener independently, without the need for [[headphones]] or an additional amplifier or speaker system. Designed for portability, boomboxes can be powered by [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] as well as by line current. The boombox was introduced to the American market during the mid-1970s. The desire for louder and heavier bass led to bigger and heavier boxes; by the 1980s, some boomboxes had reached the size of a [[suitcase]]. Most boomboxes were battery-operated, leading to extremely heavy, bulky boxes.<ref name=npr>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2009/04/22/103363836/a-eulogy-for-the-boombox|title=A Eulogy For The Boombox|date=22 April 2009|work=NPR.org|first=Frannie|last=Kelly|accessdate=November 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nMost boomboxes from the 2010s typically include a CD player compatible with [[CD-R]] and [[CD-RW]], which allows the user to carry their own music compilations on a higher fidelity medium. Many also permit iPod and similar devices to be plugged into them through one or more auxiliary ports. Some also support formats such as [[MP3]] and [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]].

For example, defensive survival circuits exist to detect and respond to threats, and can be present in all organisms. However, only organisms that can be conscious of their own brain's activities can feel fear. Fear is a conscious experience and occurs the same way as any other kind of conscious experience: via cortical circuits that allow attention to certain forms of brain activity. He argues the only differences between an emotional and non-emotion state of consciousness are the underlying neural ingredients that contribute to the state.<ref>LeDoux JE (2015) [http://www.cns.nyu.edu/home/ledoux/pdf/daed_LeDoux_2015.pdf Feelings: What are they and how does the brain make them?] Daedalus 144.</ref> These ideas and their implications for understanding the neural foundations of pathological fear and anxiety are explained in his 2015 book, Anxious.<ref>LeDoux JE (2015) Anxious: Using the Brain to Understand and Treat Fear and Anxiety.

He attended St. Edmund's Elementary School and Eunice High School, graduating in 1967. LeDoux attended [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge]] where he majored in Business Administration and minored in Psychology. In 1972 he began work on a Masters of Science in Marketing from LSU. During this time, his interest in psychology grew and he volunteered in the laboratory of Robert Thompson, who introduced him to brain research.\n\n== Academic and professional history ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020|small=y}}\nIn the fall of 1974 LeDoux began a PhD program at the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]], and completed his degree in 1977. In 1978, LeDoux joined the Department of Neurology at [[Cornell Medical School]] as a postdoctoral fellow and remained there through the rank of associate professor until 1989. During most of his time at Cornell, he worked in the Neurobiology Laboratory where he received technical training in state-of-the-art neuroscience techniques and began the research program on the brain mechanism of emotional memory that he has pursued ever since. In 1989 he joined the newly formed Center for Neural Science at NYU as an associate professor. In 1991 he was promoted to full professor, and in 1996 he became the Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Science. In 2005, he was named university professor, the highest honor for a faculty member at NYU.\n\n== Personal life ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020|small=y}}\nIn 1971 LeDoux married LSU classmate Diana Steen. They divorced amicably in 1978. Since 1982 he has been married to art critic Nancy Princenthal. Currently they reside in the Williamsburg area of [[Brooklyn]]. They have two children, Jacob S. LeDoux (died 2005) and Milo E. LeDoux. Milo is a graduate of the [[University of Oxford]], where he studied classics, and is now pursuing a career in law.\n\n== Music ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020|small=y}}\nCajun/zydeco, country, R&B, rock, and their fusion into \"[[swamp pop]]\", were influences in LeDoux's childhood. In high school, he was a disc jockey at the local radio station, KEUN, and the rhythm guitarist of two bands: the Deadbeats and the Countdowns. Although he remained an avid music fan in later life, he did not actively play guitar for many years. In 2004, LeDoux and NYU Biology Professor [[Tyler Volk]] began performing as a cover band for small parties around NYU, and in 2006 they formed The Amygdaloids. The original band also included [[Daniela Schiller]], (then an NYU postdoctoral fellow), and graduate student Nina Curley. The band's lyrics, mostly written by LeDoux, are based on neuroscientific, psychological, and philosophical themes, and offer scholarly insights into the role of mind and brain in daily life. Their inaugural CD, Heavy Mental, was released in 2007. On their second CD, Theory of My Mind, LeDoux and Grammy winner Rosanne Cash sing \"Crime of Passion\" and \"Mind over Matter\", both written by LeDoux. In 2012, the band released All in Our Minds, an EP in which all songs had \"mind\" in their title. Anxious, a companion to LeDoux's book with the same title, was released in 2015 and explores some of the same scientific themes as the book, but through song. The band's unique focus on original songs about mind and brain has landed them considerable press. They play regularly in New York City, and have also performed in Washington DC, San Antonio TX, Indianapolis IN, Lafayette LA, and Montreal. LeDoux and Amygdaloids' bassist Colin Dempsey perform as an acoustic duo called So We Are.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140113054146/http://www.cns.nyu.edu/ledoux/ledoux_bio.htm LeDouxlab \u2014 LeDoux Biography]\n*[http://www.cns.nyu.edu/corefaculty/LeDoux.php NYU/NCS : Core Faculty : Joseph LeDoux]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/psychiatrylectures#p/c/6C554BA4850E7DA4/0/9_IIgXWdF-w LeDoux Lecture \"What fearful rats can tell us about psychiatric treatment\"]\n*[http://nousthepodcast.libsyn.com/joseph-ledoux-on-the-4-billion-year-journey-to-our-conscious-selves Joseph LeDoux interviewed on NOUS the podcast 'On the 4 billion year journey to our conscious selves']\n{{Psychology|state=uncollapsed}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ledoux, Joseph E.}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1949 births]]\n[[Category:Cognitive scientists]]\n[[Category:American neuroscientists]]\n[[Category:American psychologists]]\n[[Category:20th-century psychologists]]\n[[Category:21st-century psychologists]]\n[[Category:Stony Brook University alumni]]\n[[Category:New York University faculty]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science]]\n[[Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:Weill Medical College of Cornell University faculty]]\n", "text_old": "'''Joseph E.

New York: Plenum.</ref> Because techniques for studying the human brain were limited at the time, he turned to studies of rodents where the brain could be studied in detail. He chose to focus on a simple behavioral model, Pavlovian fear conditioning. This procedure allowed him to follow the flow of information about a stimulus through the brain as it comes to control behavioral responses by way of sensory pathways to the amygdala, and gave rise to the notion of two sensory roads to the amygdala, with the \"low road\" being a quick and dirty subcortical pathway for rapid activity behavioral responses to threats and the \"high road\" providing slower but highly processed cortical information.<ref>LeDoux JE (1994) Emotion, memory and the brain.

Neuron 73:653-676.</ref> The common practice of calling brain circuits that detect and respond to threats \"fear circuits\" implies that these circuits are responsible for feelings of fear. LeDoux has argued that so-called Pavlovian fear conditioning should be renamed Pavlovian threat conditioning to avoid the implication that \"fear\" is being acquired in rats or humans.<ref>LeDoux JE (2014) [http://www.pnas.org/content/111/8/2871.full Coming to terms with fear]. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 111:2871-2878.</ref>\n\nIn 2015 he emphasised the notion of survival functions mediated by survival circuits, the purpose of which is to keep organisms alive (rather than to make emotions). For example, defensive survival circuits exist to detect and respond to threats, and can be present in all organisms. However, only organisms that can be conscious of their own brain's activities can feel fear. Fear is a conscious experience and occurs the same way as any other kind of conscious experience: via cortical circuits that allow attention to certain forms of brain activity. He argues the only differences between an emotional and non-emotion state of consciousness are the underlying neural ingredients that contribute to the state.<ref>LeDoux JE (2015) [http://www.cns.nyu.edu/home/ledoux/pdf/daed_LeDoux_2015.pdf Feelings: What are they and how does the brain make them?] Daedalus 144.</ref> These ideas and their implications for understanding the neural foundations of pathological fear and anxiety are explained in his 2015 book, Anxious.<ref>LeDoux JE (2015) Anxious: Using the Brain to Understand and Treat Fear and Anxiety.

The book has themes of [[terminal illness]], based on Lowry's own experiences with her sister Helen.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /> Lowry continued to write about difficult topics in her next publication, ''[[Autumn Street]]'' (1979), which explores themes of coping with [[racism]], [[grief]], and [[fear]] at a young age.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /> The novel is told from the perspective of a young girl who is sent to live with her grandfather during [[World War II]], based on by Lowry's own experiences during the war.<ref name=\"Biography\" />\nThe same year she published ''[[Autumn Street]]'', Lowry also published her novel ''[[Anastasia Krupnik]]'', the first installment in the Anastasia series.<ref name=\"Biography\" /> The series continued until 1995.\n\nLowry's work ''[[Number the Stars]]'' was published in 1989, and received multiple awards, including the 1990 Newbery medal.<ref name=\"newbery\" /> Lowry received the Newbery medal again in 1994, for ''[[The Giver]]'' (1993).<ref name=\"newbery\" /> After writing ''[[The Giver]]'', she published two companion novels which take place in the same universe: ''[[Gathering Blue]]'' (2000) and ''[[Messenger (novel)|Messenger]]'' (2004).

He has released solo records under the moniker 'Masvidal' and previously led the alternative rock band [[\u00c6on Spoke]]. He is also known for having worked with the metal band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] as a guitarist.\n\n==Early life==\n\nPaul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban-American civic and business leader Raul Masvidal. Masvidal's early days were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar from an early age with Carlos Molina and in college, with guitar teacher, Dave Weissbrot who became a major influence and spurred Masvidal's love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to Buddhist philosophy. He became an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and has been a Buddhist practitioner since around 2000. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] and the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups Crypha and Seaweed.\n\nMasvidal talked in detail about his experiences in his early life in some posts in his Mett\u0101 Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].\n\n== Career ==\n\nCynic released four demos from 1988 through 1991, with Masvidal developing a reputation in the Florida music scene for his musicianship. In 1989, when Masvidal was in high school, he toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular underground act, but Masvidal stuck to his guns and claimed to firmly believe in Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (metal guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990, leading in 1991 to Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert being recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''.\u00a0Masvidal did extensive world tours, in addition to appearing in the [[music video]] for \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j8vUbMmOwM Lack of Comprehension]\". After finishing their world tour with Death, both Masvidal and Reinert returned to Cynic in 1992.\n[[File:CynicFocus.jpg|left|thumb|149x149px|Cynic - Focus]]\n1993 saw the release of [[Focus (Cynic album)|''Focus'']] on the [[Roadrunner Records|Roadrunner]] label, the only album Cynic recorded until 2008.

[[Roadrunner Records|''Roadrunner'']] released a reissue of ''Focus'' in 2004 as a special collector's edition due to high demand. \n\nMasvidal also recorded the Cynic spin-off Portal, but by 2007 Cynic returned to touring, featuring Masvidal and Reinert. Cynic took a 12 year hiatus in 1995 after recording ''The Portal Tapes'' demos and Masvidal moved to Los Angeles in the fall of 1996, upon being offered a full scholarship at [[Musicians Institute]] and began work as a session musician and composer for network TV and film. \n[[File:Aeon Spoke Band.jpg|left|thumb|152x152px|[[\u00c6on Spoke]]]]\n\n\n\nDuring Cynic's hiatus, Masvidal founded [[\u00c6on Spoke]], whose ethereal indie rock was heralded as \"beautiful, exquisite [and] destined for greatness\" by Janice Long, BBC Radio. In 2004, the band received airplay on BBC Radio 2 and XFM for the single \"Silence\". The following year, the track \"Emmanuel\" appeared in the indie breakout film ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]'' \u00c6on Spoke songs have also appeared on the Warner Bros. television series ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' and the motion picture ''[[Cry Wolf (2005 film)|Cry Wolf]]''. \u00a0Their self-titled debut LP was released in 2007 on SPV Records.\n\n<br />\n[[File:Cynic - Traced in Air.jpg|left|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Traced in Air]]\n[[File:Cynicretraced.jpg|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Re-Traced]]\nCynic reunited in 2008 after a 13-year break to record ''[[Traced in Air|Traced In Air]]'', their comeback opus.

The pair's singular points of view make for an intriguing synthesis of Eastern-influenced philosophy, symbolist poetry, American blues, jazz and experimental rock.

He has released solo records under the moniker 'Masvidal' and previously led the alternative rock band [[\u00c6on Spoke]]. He is also known for having worked with the metal band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] as a guitarist.\n\n==Early life==\n\nPaul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban-American civic and business leader Raul Masvidal. Masvidal's early days were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar from an early age with Carlos Molina and in college, with guitar teacher, Dave Weissbrot who became a major influence and spurred Masvidal's love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to Buddhist philosophy. He became an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and has been a Buddhist practitioner since around 2000. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] and the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups Crypha and Seaweed.\n\nMasvidal talked in detail about his experiences in his early life in some posts in his Mett\u0101 Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].\n\n== Career ==\n\nCynic released four demos from 1988 through 1991, with Masvidal developing a reputation in the Florida music scene for his musicianship. In 1989, when Masvidal was in high school, he toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular underground act, but Masvidal stuck to his guns and claimed to firmly believe in Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (metal guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990, leading in 1991 to Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert being recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''.\u00a0Masvidal did extensive world tours, in addition to appearing in the [[music video]] for \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j8vUbMmOwM Lack of Comprehension]\".

Originally a \"small but ancient fishing village\" surrounded by open farmland, it grew rapidly in the 19th century in response to the development of its eastern neighbour Brighton, and by the [[Victorian era]] it was a fully developed town with borough status.  Neighbouring parishes such as [[Aldrington]] and [[Hangleton]] were annexed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  In 1997, as part of [[1990s United Kingdom local government reform|local government reform]], the borough merged with [[Brighton]] to form the Borough of Brighton and Hove, and this unitary authority was granted [[city status in the United Kingdom|city status]] in 2000.\n\n==Name and etymology==\nOld spellings of Hove include Hou ([[Domesday Book]], 1086), la Houue (1288), Huua (13th century), Houve (13th and 14th centuries), Huve (14th and 15th centuries), Hova (16th century) and Hoova (1675).<ref name=\"VCH-Hove\">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/sussex/vol7/pp265-268|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 7, the Rape of Lewes.

Suggestions included an [[Old Norse]] word meaning \"hall\", \"sanctuary\" or \"[[Tumulus|barrow]]\", in reference to the [[Bronze Age]] barrow near the present [[Palmeira Square]]; an [[Old English]] phrase ''aet thaem hofe'' meaning \"at the hall\";{{#tag:ref|This suggestion was given in ''[https://archive.org/stream/placenamesofsuss00robeiala/placenamesofsuss00robeiala_djvu.txt The Place-Names of Sussex]'' (1914) by R.G.

No other places in Britain are called Hove, and single-syllable names as a whole are rare in Sussex.<ref name=\"EncH&Pv7p89\"/>  The modern name was originally pronounced \"Hoove\" ({{IPAc-en|'|h|u\u02d0|v}}).

After Hove became a borough and expanded to incorporate land from neighbouring parishes, the highest point was approximately {{convert|590|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=\"EncH&Pv7p90\"/>  There are no rivers in Hove, but Westbourne Gardens at the western boundary of the old parish is named after the \"West [[Bourne (stream)|Bourne]]\", which was still visible in the 19th century but which now runs underground, and a map of 1588 shows another stream called East Brook.<ref name=\"ASON1\">{{Harvnb|s.n.|1998|p=1.}}</ref>\n\nUntil the 19th century the {{convert|778|acre|ha|adj=on}} parish was mostly agricultural.  Three farms\u2014Wick, Goldstone and Long Barn\u2014dominated the area and owned most of the land, which was of good quality: agricultural writer [[Arthur Young (agriculturist)|Arthur Young]] described it as \"uncommonly rich\".  Crops including oats, barley, corn and various vegetables were grown.  Only in the 1870s were the last of the [[market garden]]s near Hove Street built over, and barley was grown near Eaton Road until the [[County Cricket Ground, Hove|county cricket ground]] was built.  Water was provided by wells west of Hove Street and between the coast road and the sea (the latter was destroyed in the [[Great Storm of 1703]]).  The [[chalybeate]] spring on the Wick Farm estate{{#tag:ref|Now the site of [[St. Ann's Well Gardens, Hove|St Ann's Well Gardens]].|group=note}} was also used, especially by shepherds who drove their sheep between Hove, the [[South Downs]] and nearby villages along ancient [[Drovers' road|drove roads]].<ref name=\"Middleton1\u20132\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|pp=1\u20132.}}</ref>  Some local shepherds supplemented their income by catching [[lark]]s and [[wheatear]]s and selling them for their meat; the latter were popular among fashionable visitors to Brighton. The birds were common on the hills and valleys around Hove, such as Goldstone Bottom. The practice died out when wheatears became a protected species in the late 18th century.<ref name=\"Middleton10\u201311\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|pp=10\u201311.}}</ref>  The urban growth of Hove has shifted sheep-farming to more isolated parts of the South Downs, but several drove roads survive today as roads or footpaths. Hove Street and its northward continuation Sackville Road were originally known as ''Hove Drove'' and led on to the Downs.  A long west\u2013east route which crossed [[West Blatchington]], Hove and Preston parishes on its way to [[Lewes]] now bears the names The Droveway, The Drove and Preston Drove.  The section called The Droveway, on which the [[British Engineerium|Goldstone Waterworks]] was built in the 1860s, had to be maintained as a right of way when [[Hove Park]] was built.  A long diagonal footpath once known as Dyer's Drove runs for several miles from Portslade-by-Sea on to the Downs, and Drove Road in Portslade village may have been used since Roman times.<ref name=\"EncH&Pv4p34\u201336\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|2002|loc=Vol. 4, pp. 34\u201336.}}</ref>\n\nA large [[Sarsen]] stone called the Goldstone stood on farmland northwest of the village, now part of [[Hove Park]].  Links with druids were claimed; and some 19th-century sources stated it was part of a ring of stones similar to [[Stonehenge]], and that the others were buried in a pond at Goldstone Bottom, one of the [[Combe|coombes]] (small dry valleys) between the Downs and the sea.<ref name=\"VCH-Hove\"/><ref name=\"Middleton28\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|p=28.}}</ref>  The Goldstone was dug up and buried by a farmer, but was unearthed and re-erected in a new position in the park{{#tag:ref|At {{coord|50.839433|-0.173735}}|group=note}} in 1906.<ref name=\"Middleton29\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|p=29.}}</ref>\n\nHove has little ancient woodland.

Hove remained insignificant for centuries, consisting of just a single street running north\u2013south some 250&nbsp;m from the church, which by the 16th century was recorded as being in ruins.\n[[Hangleton Manor Inn|Hangleton Manor]] is a well-preserved 16th-century [[flint]] manor building. It is believed to have been built c. 1540 for Richard Bel(l)ingham, twice [[High Sheriff of Sussex]], whose initials are carved into a fireplace, and whose [[coat of arms]] adorns a period plaster ceiling. The Manor is currently serving as a pub-restaurant and whilst it was once on open downland, it is now surrounded by the 20th-century [[Hangleton]] housing estate.\n\n===18th century===\nIn 1723 a traveller, the antiquary [[John Warburton (officer of arms)|John Warburton]], wrote, 'I passed through a ruinous village called Hove which the sea is daily eating up and is in a fair way of being quite deserted; but the church being quite large and a good distance from the shore may perhaps escape'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sussexhistory.co.uk/sussex-coast/sussex-coast%20-%200284.htm |title=THE SUSSEX COAST |accessdate=2015-12-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210200159/http://www.sussexhistory.co.uk/sussex-coast/sussex-coast%20-%200284.htm |archivedate=10 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Nevertheless, in around 1702 The Ship Inn had been built at the seaward end of the main street, and was therefore vulnerable to erosion of the coast.\n\nIn 1724, [[Daniel Defoe]] wrote in reference to the south coast, 'I do not find they have any foreign commerce, except it be what we call smuggling and roguing; which I may say, is the reigning commerce of all this part of the English coast, from the mouth of the Thames to the [[Land's End]] in [[Cornwall]].\"<ref>Defoe, Daniel (1724). ''A Tour Thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain: Letter III''. London.</ref>\n\n=== Regency and Victorian developments ===\nThe census of 1801 recorded only 101 residents. By 1821, the year the Prince Regent was crowned [[George IV]], the population had risen to 312 <ref name=\"Middleton J. 1983\">Middleton J. (1983) Hove in old picture postcards, introduction</ref> with the dwellings still clustered on Hove Street, surrounded by an otherwise empty landscape of open farmland. This isolated location was ideal for smuggling and there was considerable illicit activity. Hove smugglers became notorious, with contraband often being stored in the now partially repaired St. Andrew's Church. Tradition has it that The Ship Inn was a favourite rendezvous for the smugglers, and in 1794 soldiers were billeted there. In 1818 there was a pitched battle on Hove beach between revenue men and smugglers, from which the latter emerged as the victors. As part of the concerted drive by Parliament to combat smuggling, a coastguard station was opened at the southern end of Hove Street in 1831, next to The Ship Inn.\n\nAlso at the bottom of Hove Street was the bull-ring. At a bull-bait in 1810 the bull escaped, scattering spectators before being recaptured and dragged back to the ring. This was the last bull-bait to take place in Hove.\n\nThe fertile coastal plain west of the Brighton boundary had significant deposits of [[brickearth]] and by c.1770 a brickfield had been established on the site of what would become Brunswick Square. Later, other brickfields were established further west, remaining until displaced by housing development.\n\nIn the years following the Coronation of 1821 the [[Brunswick (Hove)|Brunswick estate]] of large [[Regency architecture|Regency]] houses boasting a theatre, riding schools and their own police was developed on the seafront near the boundary with Brighton. Although within Hove parish the residents of these elegant houses studiously avoided the name of the impoverished village a mile to the west as an address. Straggling development along the coast loosely connected the estate to fashionable Brighton, so that name was used instead.\n\nDating from 1822, the Brighton to Shoreham turnpike crossed the north of Hove parish along the route of the present Old Shoreham Road.\n\nThe Brighton General Gas Light Company was formed in 1825. Production of [[coal gas]] was notorious for the foul smell it produced, and was only sited in the poorest areas. The company acquired land in the fields between Hove Street and the ruins of St. Andrew's Church, and in 1832 built a gasworks on a two-acre site. The process required substantial tonnage of coal, delivered by horse-drawn cart on the unmade tracks in the vicinity, and removal of by-products including coke, coal tar, sulphur and ammonia by the same means. With a tall chimney and two gasometers next to the churchyard, this industrial site was a considerable intrusion on the impoverished populace of Hove, although not for rapidly growing but still-distant Brighton, which was the main centre of consumption. Being situated in Hove avoided the duty of \u00a31 per 8 tons levied on coal by the Brighton Town Act of 1773. A gasworks built east of Brighton in 1819, and therefore similarly exempt, was supplied by sailing brigs grounding at high tide, the crew tipping the coal down chutes into horse-drawn carts then re-floating on the next tide. This method, risky for the vessel and also inherently dirty and disruptive, may have been used at Hove until eventually superseded. The railway arrived in 1840 whilst several miles along the coast Shoreham Harbour was increasing its coal trade. By 1861 the site had doubled in size and there were now five gasometers, ranging in size from small to large. Due to spiralling demand, in 1871 a large new works was built at Portslade-by-Sea in Shoreham Harbour, and by 1885 all gas manufacture in Brighton and Hove had been transferred there. The Hove site, in a by now primarily residential area, was then used for storage only.\n\nBy 1831 the development of the eastern end of the parish had increased the population to 1,360 <ref name=\"Middleton J. 1983\"/> but this brought few economic benefits to Hove village itself, with the historian Thomas Horsfield describing it in 1835 as 'a mean and insignificant assemblage of huts'.\n\n[[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove|St Andrew's Church]] was reconstructed and enlarged to its present form in 1836, to the design of the architect [[George Basevi]] (1794\u20131845), and features prominently in the background of paintings of the period. About this time, a very substantial and tall wall was built between the churchyard and adjoining gasworks, remaining in place to this day.\n\nThe flat coastal plain was useful for sport as from 1848 to 1871 England's oldest county club, [[Sussex County Cricket Club]], used the [[Royal Brunswick Ground]] in Hove, situated roughly on the site of present-day Third and Fourth Avenues. In 1872 the club moved to the present [[County Cricket Ground, Hove]].\n\nTwo further large estates were developed between Hove village and Brunswick, and both avoided using the name Hove: Cliftonville was designed, laid out and initially developed under [[Frederick Banister]] from the late 1840s;<ref name=\"Federick Dale Banister\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Frederick_Dale_Banister|title=Federick Dale Banister|publisher=GracesGuide.co.uk|accessdate=10 February 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927154258/http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Frederick_Dale_Banister|archivedate=27 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and West Brighton Estate in the 1870s.\n\nWest of Brunswick, the seafront of West Brighton Estate forms the end of a series of avenues, in numerical order beginning with First Avenue, mostly composed of fine [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] villas built as another well-integrated housing scheme featuring mews for artisans and service buildings. Grand Avenue, The Drive, and the numbered avenues were developed through the 1870s and 1880s, with many of the buildings constructed by [[William Willett]].\n\nHove's wide boulevards contrast with the bustle of Brighton, although many of the grand Regency and Victorian mansions have been converted into flats. Marlborough Court was once the residence of the [[Consuelo Vanderbilt|Duchess of Marlborough]], aunt of [[Winston Churchill]]. The Irish nationalist leader and Home Rule MP [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] used to visit his lover, the already married [[Katharine O'Shea|Kitty O'Shea]] at the house she rented in 1883 in Medina Villas, Hove. In the subsequent divorce action the cook alleged that Captain O\u2019Shea returned home unexpectedly and Parnell beat a hasty retreat by climbing over the balcony and down a rope ladder.<ref name=\"Middleton J. 1983 p.37\">Middleton J.

After the armistice, the town established a war memorial committee to decide on commemoration of the dead. The committee commissioned [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]], the architect responsible for [[The Cenotaph, Whitehall|the Cenotaph]] on London's Whitehall which became the focus of [[national memory|national remembrance]] services. Lutyens proposed a similar cenotaph for Hove and went as far as constructing a wooden mock-up which was displayed on Hove Lawns but the committee rejected the design. The eventual result was a statue of Saint George atop a column, situated in the centre of Grand Avenue. The memorial does not contain the names of the fallen, which are instead recorded on a bronze plaque in Hove Library.<ref>{{National Heritage List for England |num=1187556 |desc=Hove War Memorial|accessdate=27 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Skelton|first1=Tim|last2=Gliddon|first2=Gerald|title=Lutyens and the Great War|year=2008|publisher=[[Frances Lincoln Publishers]]|location=London|isbn=9780711228788|pages=75, 169}}</ref>\n\n==Governance and politics==\n\n===Coat of arms===\nWhile it was still a separate entity, Hove had its own [[coat of arms]].  The [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon's]] official heraldic description is \"Tierced in [[Pall (heraldry)|pairle]]: 1. [[Or (heraldry)|Or]] a [[Saltire#Heraldry|saltire]] [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]] voided [[argent]]; 2. [[Gules]] two pairs of leg-irons interlaced argent; 3.

The design incorporates several features relevant to Hove's history.  The ships of the French raiders who repeatedly attacked the coast in the Brighton and Hove area in the 16th century are represented by the crest.  The [[saltire]] of [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]] and the leg-shackles of [[Leonard of Noblac]] refer to the ancient [[parish church]]es of Hove and [[Aldrington]], [[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove|St Andrew's]] and [[St Leonard's Church, Aldrington|St Leonard's]] respectively.

Some concern about the pedestrianisation and its impact (supposedly killing trade) was expressed by residents, the local newspaper [[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]], and small locally owned shops. However these fears proved unfounded. In 2003 these small shops were joined by the centre's first large supermarket (a [[Tesco]]), built on the site of a former [[gasometer]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/6728127.the-great-tesco-takeover/|title=The great Tesco takeover|website=The Argus|language=en|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Uk FloralClockHove.jpg|thumb|right|Floral Clock, [[Palmeira Square]]]]\n[[Image:Hovebeach.jpg|thumb|right|Hove [[Esplanade|promenade]] facing towards [[Brighton]]]]\n\n== Transport ==\n{{main|Transport in Brighton and Hove}}\n\nHove has a comprehensive public transport system including buses to all districts, a bus monitoring system accessible via the internet and with displays at some bus stops (a system integrated with Brighton), and taxis which are able to pick up across the city of Brighton and Hove.\n\nHove has three railway stations. [[Hove railway station]] has direct access to the [[Brighton main line]] to London via a loop eliminating the need to go through [[Brighton railway station|Brighton]]. Hove is on the [[West Coastway Line]], as are [[Aldrington railway station|Aldrington]] and [[Portslade railway station|Portslade and West Hove]] stations. A 'halt' stop at Holland Road, between Hove and Brighton, was in operation from 1905 to 1956. Direct train journeys to London take just over an hour, and to Brighton, a few minutes.\n\nBranching off close to Aldrington was formerly a branch line to [[Devil's Dyke, Sussex|Devil's Dyke]] which closed in 1938. The route of the line may be followed along a path alongside West Hove golf club; the path leads all the way to Devil's Dyke, and railway sleepers once used under the tracks may be seen to either side of the path, plus the remains of two of the stations still exist in places but are on private land.\n\n== Hove Museum and Art Gallery ==\n[[Hove Museum and Art Gallery]] houses a permanent collection of toys, contemporary crafts, fine art and local history artefacts, as well as holding temporary exhibitions of contemporary crafts.[http://www.hove.virtualmuseum.info/]\n\n== Education ==\nHove is home to around Eight [[primary school]]s: West Blatchington Primary and Nursery School, St. Andrew's CE School, West Hove Junior School, Benfield Junior School, Goldstone Primary School, Hangleton Junior School, Cottesmore St Mary's Catholic School, Mile Oak Primary School, [https://www.bilingualprimaryschool.org.uk Bilingual Primary School], Brunswick Primary School and well as Aldrington CE School.

Crops including oats, barley, corn and various vegetables were grown.  Only in the 1870s were the last of the [[market garden]]s near Hove Street built over, and barley was grown near Eaton Road until the [[County Cricket Ground, Hove|county cricket ground]] was built.  Water was provided by wells west of Hove Street and between the coast road and the sea (the latter was destroyed in the [[Great Storm of 1703]]).  The [[chalybeate]] spring on the Wick Farm estate{{#tag:ref|Now the site of [[St. Ann's Well Gardens, Hove|St Ann's Well Gardens]].|group=note}} was also used, especially by shepherds who drove their sheep between Hove, the [[South Downs]] and nearby villages along ancient [[Drovers' road|drove roads]].<ref name=\"Middleton1\u20132\">{{Harvnb|Middleton|1979|pp=1\u20132.}}</ref>  Some local shepherds supplemented their income by catching [[lark]]s and [[wheatear]]s and selling them for their meat; the latter were popular among fashionable visitors to Brighton.

Hove remained insignificant for centuries, consisting of just a single street running north\u2013south some 250&nbsp;m from the church, which by the 16th century was recorded as being in ruins.\n[[Hangleton Manor Inn|Hangleton Manor]] is a well-preserved 16th-century [[flint]] manor building. It is believed to have been built c. 1540 for Richard Bel(l)ingham, twice [[High Sheriff of Sussex]], whose initials are carved into a fireplace, and whose [[coat of arms]] adorns a period plaster ceiling. The Manor is currently serving as a pub-restaurant and whilst it was once on open downland, it is now surrounded by the 20th-century [[Hangleton]] housing estate.\n\n===18th century===\nIn 1723 a traveller, the antiquary [[John Warburton (officer of arms)|John Warburton]], wrote, 'I passed through a ruinous village called Hove which the sea is daily eating up and is in a fair way of being quite deserted; but the church being quite large and a good distance from the shore may perhaps escape'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sussexhistory.co.uk/sussex-coast/sussex-coast%20-%200284.htm |title=THE SUSSEX COAST |accessdate=2015-12-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210200159/http://www.sussexhistory.co.uk/sussex-coast/sussex-coast%20-%200284.htm |archivedate=10 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Nevertheless, in around 1702 The Ship Inn had been built at the seaward end of the main street, and was therefore vulnerable to erosion of the coast.\n\nIn 1724, [[Daniel Defoe]] wrote in reference to the south coast, 'I do not find they have any foreign commerce, except it be what we call smuggling and roguing; which I may say, is the reigning commerce of all this part of the English coast, from the mouth of the Thames to the [[Land's End]] in [[Cornwall]].\"<ref>Defoe, Daniel (1724). ''A Tour Thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain: Letter III''. London.</ref>\n\n=== Regency and Victorian developments ===\nThe census of 1801 recorded only 101 residents. By 1821, the year the Prince Regent was crowned [[George IV]], the population had risen to 312 <ref name=\"Middleton J. 1983\">Middleton J. (1983) Hove in old picture postcards, introduction</ref> with the dwellings still clustered on Hove Street, surrounded by an otherwise empty landscape of open farmland. This isolated location was ideal for smuggling and there was considerable illicit activity. Hove smugglers became notorious, with contraband often being stored in the now partially repaired St. Andrew's Church. Tradition has it that The Ship Inn was a favourite rendezvous for the smugglers, and in 1794 soldiers were billeted there. In 1818 there was a pitched battle on Hove beach between revenue men and smugglers, from which the latter emerged as the victors. As part of the concerted drive by Parliament to combat smuggling, a coastguard station was opened at the southern end of Hove Street in 1831, next to The Ship Inn.\n\nAlso at the bottom of Hove Street was the bull-ring. At a bull-bait in 1810 the bull escaped, scattering spectators before being recaptured and dragged back to the ring. This was the last bull-bait to take place in Hove.\n\nThe fertile coastal plain west of the Brighton boundary had significant deposits of [[brickearth]] and by c.1770 a brickfield had been established on the site of what would become Brunswick Square. Later, other brickfields were established further west, remaining until displaced by housing development.\n\nIn the years following the Coronation of 1821 the [[Brunswick (Hove)|Brunswick estate]] of large [[Regency architecture|Regency]] houses boasting a theatre, riding schools and their own police was developed on the seafront near the boundary with Brighton. Although within Hove parish the residents of these elegant houses studiously avoided the name of the impoverished village a mile to the west as an address. Straggling development along the coast loosely connected the estate to fashionable Brighton, so that name was used instead.\n\nDating from 1822, the Brighton to Shoreham turnpike crossed the north of Hove parish along the route of the present Old Shoreham Road.\n\nThe Brighton General Gas Light Company was formed in 1825. Production of [[coal gas]] was notorious for the foul smell it produced, and was only sited in the poorest areas. The company acquired land in the fields between Hove Street and the ruins of St. Andrew's Church, and in 1832 built a gasworks on a two-acre site. The process required substantial tonnage of coal, delivered by horse-drawn cart on the unmade tracks in the vicinity, and removal of by-products including coke, coal tar, sulphur and ammonia by the same means. With a tall chimney and two gasometers next to the churchyard, this industrial site was a considerable intrusion on the impoverished populace of Hove, although not for rapidly growing but still-distant Brighton, which was the main centre of consumption. Being situated in Hove avoided the duty of \u00a31 per 8 tons levied on coal by the Brighton Town Act of 1773. A gasworks built east of Brighton in 1819, and therefore similarly exempt, was supplied by sailing brigs grounding at high tide, the crew tipping the coal down chutes into horse-drawn carts then re-floating on the next tide. This method, risky for the vessel and also inherently dirty and disruptive, may have been used at Hove until eventually superseded. The railway arrived in 1840 whilst several miles along the coast Shoreham Harbour was increasing its coal trade. By 1861 the site had doubled in size and there were now five gasometers, ranging in size from small to large. Due to spiralling demand, in 1871 a large new works was built at Portslade-by-Sea in Shoreham Harbour, and by 1885 all gas manufacture in Brighton and Hove had been transferred there. The Hove site, in a by now primarily residential area, was then used for storage only.\n\nBy 1831 the development of the eastern end of the parish had increased the population to 1,360 <ref name=\"Middleton J. 1983\"/> but this brought few economic benefits to Hove village itself, with the historian Thomas Horsfield describing it in 1835 as 'a mean and insignificant assemblage of huts'.\n\n[[St Andrew's Church, Church Road, Hove|St Andrew's Church]] was reconstructed and enlarged to its present form in 1836, to the design of the architect [[George Basevi]] (1794\u20131845), and features prominently in the background of paintings of the period. About this time, a very substantial and tall wall was built between the churchyard and adjoining gasworks, remaining in place to this day.\n\nThe flat coastal plain was useful for sport as from 1848 to 1871 England's oldest county club, [[Sussex County Cricket Club]], used the [[Royal Brunswick Ground]] in Hove, situated roughly on the site of present-day Third and Fourth Avenues. In 1872 the club moved to the present [[County Cricket Ground, Hove]].\n\nTwo further large estates were developed between Hove village and Brunswick, and both avoided using the name Hove: Cliftonville was designed, laid out and initially developed under [[Frederick Banister]] from the late 1840s;<ref name=\"Federick Dale Banister\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Frederick_Dale_Banister|title=Federick Dale Banister|publisher=GracesGuide.co.uk|accessdate=10 February 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927154258/http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Frederick_Dale_Banister|archivedate=27 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and West Brighton Estate in the 1870s.\n\nWest of Brunswick, the seafront of West Brighton Estate forms the end of a series of avenues, in numerical order beginning with First Avenue, mostly composed of fine [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] villas built as another well-integrated housing scheme featuring mews for artisans and service buildings. Grand Avenue, The Drive, and the numbered avenues were developed through the 1870s and 1880s, with many of the buildings constructed by [[William Willett]].\n\nHove's wide boulevards contrast with the bustle of Brighton, although many of the grand Regency and Victorian mansions have been converted into flats. Marlborough Court was once the residence of the [[Consuelo Vanderbilt|Duchess of Marlborough]], aunt of [[Winston Churchill]]. The Irish nationalist leader and Home Rule MP [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] used to visit his lover, the already married [[Katharine O'Shea|Kitty O'Shea]] at the house she rented in 1883 in Medina Villas, Hove. In the subsequent divorce action the cook alleged that Captain O\u2019Shea returned home unexpectedly and Parnell beat a hasty retreat by climbing over the balcony and down a rope ladder.<ref name=\"Middleton J. 1983 p.37\">Middleton J.

The committee commissioned [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]], the architect responsible for [[The Cenotaph, Whitehall|the Cenotaph]] on London's Whitehall which became the focus of [[national memory|national remembrance]] services. Lutyens proposed a similar cenotaph for Hove and went as far as constructing a wooden mock-up which was displayed on Hove Lawns but the committee rejected the design. The eventual result was a statue of Saint George atop a column, situated in the centre of Grand Avenue. The memorial does not contain the names of the fallen, which are instead recorded on a bronze plaque in Hove Library.<ref>{{National Heritage List for England |num=1187556 |desc=Hove War Memorial|accessdate=27 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Skelton|first1=Tim|last2=Gliddon|first2=Gerald|title=Lutyens and the Great War|year=2008|publisher=[[Frances Lincoln Publishers]]|location=London|isbn=9780711228788|pages=75, 169}}</ref>\n\n==Governance and politics==\n\n===Coat of arms===\nWhile it was still a separate entity, Hove had its own [[coat of arms]].

Some concern about the pedestrianisation and its impact (supposedly killing trade) was expressed by residents, the local newspaper [[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]], and small locally owned shops. However these fears proved unfounded. In 2003 these small shops were joined by the centre's first large supermarket (a [[Tesco]]), built on the site of a former [[gasometer]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/6728127.the-great-tesco-takeover/|title=The great Tesco takeover|website=The Argus|language=en|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Uk FloralClockHove.jpg|thumb|right|Floral Clock, [[Palmeira Square]]]]\n[[Image:Hovebeach.jpg|thumb|right|Hove [[Esplanade|promenade]] facing towards [[Brighton]]]]\n\n== Transport ==\n{{main|Transport in Brighton and Hove}}\n\nHove has a comprehensive public transport system including buses to all districts, a bus monitoring system accessible via the internet and with displays at some bus stops (a system integrated with Brighton), and taxis which are able to pick up across the city of Brighton and Hove.\n\nHove has three railway stations.

Hove is on the [[West Coastway Line]], as are [[Aldrington railway station|Aldrington]] and [[Portslade railway station|Portslade and West Hove]] stations. A 'halt' stop at Holland Road, between Hove and Brighton, was in operation from 1905 to 1956. Direct train journeys to London take just over an hour, and to Brighton, a few minutes.\n\nBranching off close to Aldrington was formerly a branch line to [[Devil's Dyke, Sussex|Devil's Dyke]] which closed in 1938. The route of the line may be followed along a path alongside West Hove golf club; the path leads all the way to Devil's Dyke, and railway sleepers once used under the tracks may be seen to either side of the path, plus the remains of two of the stations still exist in places but are on private land.\n\n== Hove Museum and Art Gallery ==\n[[Hove Museum and Art Gallery]] houses a permanent collection of toys, contemporary crafts, fine art and local history artefacts, as well as holding temporary exhibitions of contemporary crafts.[http://www.hove.virtualmuseum.info/]\n\n== Education ==\nHove is home to around Eight [[primary school]]s: West Blatchington Primary and Nursery School, St. Andrew's CE School, West Hove Junior School, Benfield Junior School, Goldstone Primary School, Hangleton Junior School, Cottesmore St Mary's Catholic School, Mile Oak Primary School, [https://www.bilingualprimaryschool.org.uk Bilingual Primary School], Brunswick Primary School and well as Aldrington CE School.

James joined Healy for a two-year run in the Shubert revue ''A Night in Spain'' (1927\u20131928) where he worked alongside [[Shemp Howard]] and [[Larry Fine]]. Mousie joined with Healy from 1931 \u2013 1932  after [[Moe Howard]], [[Larry Fine]] and [[Shemp Howard]] had their first split with Ted, and with fellow Healy \"stooges\" Dick Hakins and Jack Wolfe, appeared in the Broadway shows ''The Gang's All Here'' and ''Billy Rose's Crazy Quilt''. Mousie, with Hakins and Sammy Glasser (aka Sammy Wolfe) rejoined Healy in 1937 for radio and personal appearances, until Healy's death in December 1937.\n\nSpike Jones's second wife, singer [[Helen Grayco]], performed in his stage and television shows. Jones had four children: Linda (by his first wife, Patricia), [[Spike Jones, Jr.|Spike Jr.]], Leslie Ann and Gina. Spike Jr. is a producer of live events and television broadcasts. [[Leslie Ann Jones|Leslie Ann]] is the Director of Music and Film Scoring at [[George Lucas]]' [[Skywalker Ranch]] in [[Marin County]].{{citation needed|date= June 2012}}\n\n==Record hits==\n\n===\"Der Fuehrer's Face\"===\nIn 1942, a strike by the [[American Federation of Musicians]] prevented Jones from making commercial recordings for over two years. He could, however, make records for radio broadcasts. These were released on the Standard Transcriptions label (1941\u20131946) and have been reissued on a CD compilation called ''(Not) Your Standard Spike Jones Collection''.\n\nRecorded just days before the recording ban, Jones scored a huge broadcast hit late in 1942 with \"[[Der Fuehrer's Face#Song|Der Fuehrer's Face]]\", a song ridiculing [[Adolf Hitler]], which followed every use of the word \"Heil\" with a derisive [[Blowing a raspberry|raspberry]] sound, as in the repeated phrase \"&nbsp;Heil, (raspberry), Heil (raspberry), right in Der Fuehrer's face!\".\n\n===More satirical songs===\n{{Listen\n  | filename = SpikeJones.CocktailsForTwo.excerpt.ogg\n  | title = Spike Jones and His City Slickers: Cocktails for Two\n  | description = 16-second sample, as the musical [[wikt:mayhem|mayhem]] begins\n  | format = [[ogg]]\n}}\nThe romantic ballad \"[[Cocktails for Two]]\", originally written to evoke an intimate romantic rendezvous, was re-recorded by Spike Jones in 1944 as a raucous, horn-honking, voice-gurgling, hiccuping hymn to the cocktail hour. The Jones version was a huge hit.\n\nOther Jones satires followed: \"[[Hawaiian War Chant]]\", \"[[Chlo-e (Song of the Swamp)|Chloe]]\", \"[[Holiday for Strings (song)|Holiday for Strings]]\", \"[[You Always Hurt the One You Love]]\",<ref name=pc1b>{{Pop Chronicles 40s|1|B}}</ref> \"My Old Flame\", referring to [[Peter Lorre]]'s voice (impersonated on the recording by [[Paul Frees]]) and eerie scenes in contemporary movies, and many more.\n\n===\"Ghost Riders\"===\nSpike's parody of [[Vaughn Monroe]]'s rendition of \"[[Ghost Riders in the Sky]]\" was performed as if sung by a drunkard and ridiculed Monroe by name in its final stanza:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222124210/http://www.ibras.dk/comedy/spike3.htm |title=Spike Jones Can't Stop Murdering |date=February 22, 2016 |website=Web.archive.org |accessdate=October 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>''Cocktails For Two'', Pro-Arte PCD 516,1990, Side 2, Track 5.</ref> <blockquote>\nCHORUS: 'Cause all we hear is \"Ghost Riders\" sung by Vaughn Monroe.<br />\nI.W.

(A few pressings containing the first ending were mistakenly released on the West Coast and are a prized rarity today.)\n\n===\"All I Want for Christmas\"===\nJones' recording, \"[[All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth]]\", with a piping vocal by [[George Rock]], was a number-one hit in 1948. ([[Dora Bryan]] recorded a 1963 variation, \"All I Want For Christmas is a [[The Beatles|Beatle]]\".)\n\n===Murdering the Classics===\n[[File:Spike Jones 1948.jpg|thumb|Jones with some of his musical instruments \u2013 empty tin cans \u2013 in the background]]\nAmong the series of recordings in the 1940s were humorous takes on the classics such as the adaptation of [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]'s ''[[Liebestr\u00e4ume|Liebestraum No. 3]]'', played at a breakneck pace on unusual instruments. Others followed: [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s ''William Tell Overture'' was rendered on kitchen implements using a [[horse race]] as a backdrop, with one of the \"horses\" in the \"race\" likely to have inspired the nickname of the lone [[chrome yellow]]-painted [[AT-6 Texan|SNJ]] aircraft flown by the U.S. Navy's [[Blue Angels#1940s|Blue Angels]] aerobatic team's shows in the late 1940s, \"Beetle Bomb\". In live shows Spike would acknowledge the applause with complete solemnity, saying \"Thank you, music lovers.\" An [[LP record|LP]] collection of twelve of these \"homicides\" was released by RCA (on its prestigious [[RCA Red Seal Records|Red Seal]] label) in 1971 as ''Spike Jones Is Murdering the Classics.'' They include such ''tours de force'' as Pal-Yat-Chee (''[[Pagliacci]]''), sung by the Hillbilly humorists [[Homer and Jethro]], Ponchielli's ''[[Dance of the Hours]]'', Tchaikovsky's ''[[None but the Lonely Heart (Tchaikovsky)|None but the Lonely Heart]]'', and Bizet's ''[[Carmen]]''.\n\nIn 1944 RCA Victor released his \"Spike Jones presents for the Kiddies\" version of Tchaikovsky's ''Nutcracker Suite'', in three 10 inch 78 rpm records, P-143, arrangement credited to Joe \"Country\" Washburne with lyrics by Foster Carling. It was released as a three 7 inch 45 rpm vinyl set in 1949 as WP-143 and as a one 45rpm extended play EPA-143 in 1952. An abridged and re-sequenced version is also included in the aforementioned 'classics' album, with the complete original version available on the CD collection ''Spiked: The Music of Spike Jones''.\n\n==Radio==\nAfter appearing as the house band on ''[[The Bob Burns Show]],'' Spike got his own radio show on [[NBC]], ''[[The Chase and Sanborn Hour|The Chase and Sanborn Program]]'', as [[Edgar Bergen]]'s summer replacement in 1945. [[Frances Langford]] was co-host and [[Groucho Marx]] was among the guests. The guest list for Jones's 1947\u201349 CBS program for [[Coca-Cola]] (originally ''The Spotlight Revue'', retitled ''The Spike Jones Show'' for its final season) included [[Frankie Laine]], [[Mel Torme]], Peter Lorre, [[Don Ameche]] and [[Burl Ives]]. [[Frank Sinatra]] appeared on the show in October 1948, and [[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]] in May 1949. Jones's resident \"girlsinger\" during this period was [[Dorothy Shay]], \"The Park Avenue Hillbillie.\" One of the announcers on Jones's CBS show was the young [[Mike Wallace]]. Writers included Eddie Maxwell, Eddie Brandt and [[Jay Sommers]]. The final program in the series was broadcast in June 1949.\n\n==Spike Jones and His Other Orchestra==\nWhile Jones enjoyed the fame and prosperity, he was annoyed that nobody seemed to see beyond the craziness. Determined to show the world that he was capable of producing legitimate \"pretty\" music, he formed a second group in 1946. Spike Jones and His Other Orchestra played lush arrangements of dance hits. This alternate group played nightclub engagements and was an artistic success, but the paying public preferred the City Slickers and stayed away. Jones wound up paying some of the band's expenses out of his own pocket. Some of the City Slickers band members appeared and recorded with the Other Orchestra, but most of the Other Orchestra personnel consisted of \"serious,\" accomplished studio musicians from the Los Angeles area.\n\nThe one outstanding recording by the Other Orchestra is \"Laura\", which features a serious first half (played exquisitely by the Other Orchestra) and a manic second half (played hilariously by the City Slickers).\n\nJones' son, Spike Jones Jr., called attention to the precision of his father's most outlandish musical arrangements: \"One of the things that people don't realize about Dad's kind of music is, when you replace a C-sharp with a gunshot, it has to be a C-sharp gunshot or it sounds awful.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-05-08-bk-55045-story.html |title=Brevity's Raincheck |date=May 8, 1994 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=October 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Movies==\nIn 1940, Jones had an uncredited bandleading part in the [[Dead End Kids]] film ''Give Us Wings'', appearing on camera for about four seconds.\n\nAs the band's fame grew, Hollywood producers hired the Slickers as a specialty act for feature films, including ''[[Thank Your Lucky Stars (1943 film)|Thank Your Lucky Stars]]'' (1943), ''[[Meet the People]]'' (1944), ''[[Bring on the Girls (film)|Bring on the Girls]]'' (1945), ''[[Breakfast in Hollywood]]'' (1946) and ''[[Variety Girl]]'' (1947). Jones was set to team with [[Abbott and Costello]] for a [[1954 in film|1954]] [[Universal Pictures]] comedy, but when Lou Costello withdrew for medical reasons, Universal replaced the comedy team with look-alikes [[Hugh O'Brian]] and [[Buddy Hackett]], and promoted Jones to the leading role. The finished film, ''[[Fireman Save My Child (1954 film)|Fireman Save My Child]]'', turned out to be Spike Jones's only top-billed theatrical movie.\n\n==Soundies==\nIn 1942, the Jones gang worked on numerous [[Soundies]], musical shorts similar to later [[music video]]s which were shown on coin-operated projectors in arcades, malt shops, and taverns. The band appeared on camera under their own name in four of the Soundies (\"Clink! Clink! Another Drink\", \"Pass the Biscuits, Mirandy\", \"The Sheik of Araby\", and \"Blacksmith Song\"), and, according to musicologist Mark Cantor, provided background music for at least thirteen others. [[Mel Blanc]], the voice of [[Bugs Bunny]] and other [[Warner Brothers]] cartoon characters, performed a drunken, hiccuping verse for 1942's \"Clink! Clink! Another Drink\" (reissued in 1949 as \"The Clink! Clink! Polka\").\n\n==Television==\n[[File:Spike Jones Bill Dana Helen Grayco Spike Jones Show 1960.JPG|thumb|180px|Jones and his wife, [[Helen Grayco]], with [[Bill Dana (comedian)|Bill Dana]] in 1960. Dana wrote and produced the summer replacement show, as well as performed on it.]]\nJones saw the potential of television and filmed two half-hour pilot films, ''Foreign Legion'' and ''Wild Bill Hiccup'', in the summer of 1950. Veteran comedy director [[Edward F. Cline|Eddie Cline]] worked on both, but neither was successful. The band fared much better on live television, where their spontaneous antics and crazy visual gags guaranteed the viewers a good time. Spike usually dressed in a suit with an enormous check pattern and was seen leaping around playing a washboard, cowbells, a suite of klaxons and foghorns, then xylophone, then shooting a pistol. The band starred in variety shows, such as ''[[The Colgate Comedy Hour]]'' (1951, 1955)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/C/htmlC/colgatecomed/colgatecomed.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009220817/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/C/htmlC/colgatecomed/colgatecomed.htm|url-status=dead|title=The Museum of Broadcast Communications.

Jones and his City Slickers also appeared on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Ford Show|The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford]]'' in the episode which aired on November 15, 1956.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ernieford.com/TEFTVGuests.htm |title=The Ford Show Guest Guide |publisher=ernieford.com |accessdate=November 23, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128190749/http://ernieford.com/TEFTVGuests.htm |archivedate=November 28, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>  In 1990, [[BBC Two|BBC2]] screened six compilation shows from these broadcasts; they were subsequently aired on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] stations.\n\n==Later years==\nThe decline of big bands and the rise of [[rock and roll]] in the early 1950s hurt Spike Jones' repertoire. Early rock songs were ''already'' novelties, and Jones could not satirise them the same way he had lampooned \"Cocktails for Two\", \"Chloe\" or \"Laura\". He played rock music for laughs when he presented \"for the first time on television, the bottom half of [[Elvis Presley]]!\" This was the cue for a pair of pants\u2014inhabited by dwarf actor [[Billy Barty]]\u2014to scamper across the stage.<ref>{{cite book |last=Young |first=Jordan R. |year=2005 |title=Spike Jones Off the Record: The Man Who Murdered Music |edition=3rd |location=Albany |publisher=BearManor Media |isbn=1-59393-012-7}}</ref>\n\nJones was always prepared to adapt to changing tastes. In 1950, when America was nostalgically looking back at the 1920s, Jones recorded a straight album of Charleston arrangements. In 1953, he responded to the growing market for children's records, with tunes aimed directly at kids (like \"Socko, the Smallest Snowball\"). Jones had become increasingly unhappy at RCA Victor due to management interfering with his choice of repertoire and other matters, and he left the label in 1955. His later recordings were issued by [[Verve Records|Verve]], [[Liberty Records|Liberty]] and [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] In 1956, Jones supervised an album of Christmas songs, many of which were performed seriously. In 1957, noting the television success of [[Lawrence Welk]] and his dance band, he revamped his own act for television. Gone was the old City Slickers mayhem, replaced by a more straightforward big-band sound, with tongue-in-cheek comic moments. The new band was known as Spike Jones and the Band that Plays for Fun. The last City Slickers record was the LP ''[[Dinner Music for People Who Aren't Very Hungry]]''. The whole field of comedy records changed from musical satires to spoken-word comedy ([[Bob Newhart]], [[Mort Sahl]], [[Stan Freberg]]). Spike Jones adapted to this, too; most of his later albums are spoken-word comedy, including the horror-genre sendup ''[[Spike Jones in Stereo]]'' (1959) and the send-up of television programs of the period in ''Omnibust'' (1960). Jones remained topical to the last: his final group, Spike Jones's New Band, recorded four LPs of brassy renditions of pop-folk tunes of the 1960s (including \"Washington Square\" and \"The Ballad of Jed Clampett\"). One of his New Band tracks in 1964 was a cover of \"[[Dominique]]\", a hit by [[The Singing Nun]], in which he not only plays part of the melody on a [[banjo]] but melds the melody successfully with \"[[When the Saints Go Marching In]]!\"\n\nJones was a lifelong heavy smoker, reportedly 4-5 packs a day, and eventually he developed [[emphysema]]. Never a very healthy person, his health would deteriorate to the point where he had to use an oxygen tank both offstage and onstage, and he was confined to a seat behind his drum set. In spite of his illness, he continued smoking for the rest of his life and he died in May 1965 at the age of 53. He is buried in [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City|Holy Cross Cemetery]], [[Culver City, California]].\n\n==Influence==\nThere is a clear line of influence from [[Harry Reser]]'s 1920s hot-comic \"Six Jumping Jacks\" band (whose drummer and vocalist was the distinctive [[Tom Stacks]], \"The Voice With a Smile\"), the [[Hoosier Hot Shots]], [[Freddie Fisher (musician)|Freddie Fisher]] and his [[Schnickelfritz Band|Schnickelfritzers]], and the [[Marx Brothers]] to Spike Jones&nbsp;\u2014 and to [[Stan Freberg]], [[Gerard Hoffnung]], [[Peter Schickele]]'s [[P.D.Q. Bach]], [[The Goons]], [[Joe Raposo]], [[Mr. Bungle]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band]], [[Oingo Boingo|The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo]], and [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]]. [[Billy Barty]] appeared in Yankovic's film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' and a video based on the movie. According to David Wild's review in Rolling Stone Magazine, [[Elvis Costello]]'s 1989 Album \"[[Spike (Elvis Costello album)|Spike]]\" was named partly in tribute to Jones.\n\nSyndicated radio personality [[Dr. Demento]] regularly features Jones' music on his program of comedy and novelty tracks. Jones is mentioned in [[The Band]]'s song, \"[[Up on Cripple Creek]]\". (The song's protagonist's paramour states of Jones: \"I can't take the way he sings, but I love to hear him talk.\") Novelist [[Thomas Pynchon]] is an admirer and wrote the liner notes for a 1994 reissue, ''Spiked!'' (BMG Catalyst). A scene in the romantic comedy ''[[I.Q. (film)|I.Q.]]'' shows a man demonstrating the sound of his new stereo to [[Meg Ryan]]'s character by playing a record of Jones' music.\n\nIn 1974, Tony Levin (future bass player for King Crimson), recording under the name, The Clams, released a Spike Jones tribute of him giving the songs, \"Close To You\", by The Carpenters, and, \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\", by Roberta Flack, the Jones treatment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/thb404f|title=The Clams - Close To You|website=45cat.com|accessdate=October 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1986, the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[synthpop]] group [[Telex (band)|Telex]] paid homage to Spike Jones in their album ''Looney Tunes'', with a song named after him.

Ballads receiving the Jones treatment were punctuated with gunshots, whistles, cowbells and outlandish and comedic vocals. Jones and his band recorded under the title '''Spike Jones and his City Slickers''' from the early 1940s to the mid-1950s, and toured the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] as ''The Musical Depreciation Revue''.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Spike Jones HS Yearbook.jpeg|thumb|Jones as a senior in high school, 1929]]\nJones' father was a [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] railroad agent.

In the 1930s he joined the [[Victor Young]] orchestra and got many offers to appear on radio shows, including [[Al Jolson]]'s ''Lifebuoy Program'', ''[[Burns and Allen]]'', and [[Bing Crosby]]'s ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]''.<ref name=Jones/>\n\nJones became bored playing the same music each night with the orchestras. He found other like-minded musicians and they began playing parodies of standard songs for their own entertainment. The musicians wanted their wives to share their enjoyment, so they recorded their weekly performances. One of the recordings made its way into the hands of an [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] executive, who offered the musicians a recording contract. One of the City Slickers' early recordings for the label was a [[Del Porter]] arrangement of  \"[[Der Fuehrer's Face#Song|Der Fuehrer's Face]]\".<ref name=Jones/> The record's success inspired Jones to become the band's leader. He initially thought the popularity the record brought them would fade. However, audiences kept asking for more, so Jones started working on more comic arrangements.<ref name=Jones/>\n\nFrom 1937 to 1942, Jones was the percussionist for [[the John Scott Trotter Orchestra]], which played on Bing Crosby's first recording of \"[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://community.mcckc.edu/crosby/trotter.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060724001618/http://community.mcckc.edu/crosby/trotter.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 July 2006 |title=Error 404 \u2013 Page Not Found |website=Community.mcckc.edu |accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref> He was part of a backing band for songwriter [[Cindy Walker]] during her early recording career with [[Decca Records]] and Standard Transcriptions.

They recorded extensively for the company until 1955. They also starred in various radio programs (1945\u20131949) and in their own [[NBC]] and [[CBS]] [[The Spike Jones Show (series)|television shows]] from 1954 to 1961.\n\nDuring the 1940s, prominent band members included:\n\n[[File:Spike Dyke Dick Tracy.jpg|right|thumb|300px|September 14, 1949 appearance of Spike Dyke, modeled on Spike Jones, in [[Chester Gould]]'s ''[[Dick Tracy]]'']]\n*[[George Rock]] (trumpet, and vocals from 1944 to 1960)\n*[[Mickey Katz]] (clarinet, vocals)\n*[[Doodles Weaver]] (vocals&nbsp;\u2014 specialized in playing sports commentators and absentminded singers who persistently scrambled their lyrics into [[malapropism]]s and digressed into [[stand-up comedy]])\n*[[Red Ingle]] (sax, vocals)\n*[[Frank Rehak]] (trombone)\n*[[Del Porter]] (clarinet, vocals)\n*Carl Grayson (violin, vocals)\n*Perry Botkin (banjo)\n*Country Washburne (tuba)\n*Luther \"Red\" Roundtree (banjo)\n*Earl Bennett, AKA Sir Frederick Gas (vocals)\n*Joe Siracusa (drums)\n*Joe Colvin (trombone)\n*Roger Donley (tuba)\n*Dick Gardner (sax, violin)\n*Paul Leu (piano)\n*Jack Golly (trumpet, clarinet)\n*John Stanley (trombone)\n*Don Anderson (trumpet)\n*Charlotte Tinsley (harp)\n*Eddie Metcalfe (saxophone)\n*Dick Morgan (banjo)\n*George Lescher (piano)\n*[[Freddy Morgan (musician)|Freddy Morgan]] (banjo, vocals)\n*[[Purv Pullen|A.

James joined Healy for a two-year run in the Shubert revue ''A Night in Spain'' (1927\u20131928) where he worked alongside [[Shemp Howard]] and [[Larry Fine]]. Mousie joined with Healy from 1931 \u2013 1932  after [[Moe Howard]], [[Larry Fine]] and [[Shemp Howard]] had their first split with Ted, and with fellow Healy \"stooges\" Dick Hakins and Jack Wolfe, appeared in the Broadway shows ''The Gang's All Here'' and ''Billy Rose's Crazy Quilt''. Mousie, with Hakins and Sammy Glasser (aka Sammy Wolfe) rejoined Healy in 1937 for radio and personal appearances, until Healy's death in December 1937.\n\nSpike Jones's second wife, singer [[Helen Grayco]], performed in his stage and television shows. Jones had four children: Linda (by his first wife, Patricia), [[Spike Jones, Jr.|Spike Jr.]], Leslie Ann and Gina. Spike Jr. is a producer of live events and television broadcasts. [[Leslie Ann Jones|Leslie Ann]] is the Director of Music and Film Scoring at [[George Lucas]]' [[Skywalker Ranch]] in [[Marin County]].{{citation needed|date= June 2012}}\n\n==Record hits==\n\n===\"Der Fuehrer's Face\"===\nIn 1942, a strike by the [[American Federation of Musicians]] prevented Jones from making commercial recordings for over two years. He could, however, make records for radio broadcasts. These were released on the Standard Transcriptions label (1941\u20131946) and have been reissued on a CD compilation called ''(Not) Your Standard Spike Jones Collection''.\n\nRecorded just days before the recording ban, Jones scored a huge broadcast hit late in 1942 with \"[[Der Fuehrer's Face#Song|Der Fuehrer's Face]]\", a song ridiculing [[Adolf Hitler]], which followed every use of the word \"Heil\" with a derisive [[Blowing a raspberry|raspberry]] sound, as in the repeated phrase \"&nbsp;Heil, (raspberry), Heil (raspberry), right in Der Fuehrer's face!\".\n\n===More satirical songs===\n{{Listen\n  | filename = SpikeJones.CocktailsForTwo.excerpt.ogg\n  | title = Spike Jones and His City Slickers: Cocktails for Two\n  | description = 16-second sample, as the musical [[wikt:mayhem|mayhem]] begins\n  | format = [[ogg]]\n}}\nThe romantic ballad \"[[Cocktails for Two]]\", originally written to evoke an intimate romantic rendezvous, was re-recorded by Spike Jones in 1944 as a raucous, horn-honking, voice-gurgling, hiccuping hymn to the cocktail hour. The Jones version was a huge hit.\n\nOther Jones satires followed: \"[[Hawaiian War Chant]]\", \"[[Chlo-e (Song of the Swamp)|Chloe]]\", \"[[Holiday for Strings (song)|Holiday for Strings]]\", \"[[You Always Hurt the One You Love]]\",<ref name=pc1b>{{Pop Chronicles 40s|1|B}}</ref> \"My Old Flame\", referring to [[Peter Lorre]]'s voice (impersonated on the recording by [[Paul Frees]]) and eerie scenes in contemporary movies, and many more.\n\n===\"Ghost Riders\"===\nSpike's parody of [[Vaughn Monroe]]'s rendition of \"[[Ghost Riders in the Sky]]\" was performed as if sung by a drunkard and ridiculed Monroe by name in its final stanza:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222124210/http://www.ibras.dk/comedy/spike3.htm |title=Spike Jones Can't Stop Murdering |date=February 22, 2016 |website=Web.archive.org |accessdate=October 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>''Cocktails For Two'', Pro-Arte PCD 516,1990, Side 2, Track 5.</ref> <blockquote>\nCHORUS: 'Cause all we hear is \"Ghost Riders\" sung by Vaughn Monroe.<br />\nI.W.

(A few pressings containing the first ending were mistakenly released on the West Coast and are a prized rarity today.)\n\n===\"All I Want for Christmas\"===\nJones' recording, \"[[All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth]]\", with a piping vocal by [[George Rock]], was a number-one hit in 1948. ([[Dora Bryan]] recorded a 1963 variation, \"All I Want For Christmas is a [[The Beatles|Beatle]]\".)\n\n===Murdering the Classics===\n[[File:Spike Jones 1948.jpg|thumb|Jones with some of his musical instruments \u2013 empty tin cans \u2013 in the background]]\nAmong the series of recordings in the 1940s were humorous takes on the classics such as the adaptation of [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]'s ''[[Liebestr\u00e4ume|Liebestraum No. 3]]'', played at a breakneck pace on unusual instruments. Others followed: [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s ''William Tell Overture'' was rendered on kitchen implements using a [[horse race]] as a backdrop, with one of the \"horses\" in the \"race\" likely to have inspired the nickname of the lone [[chrome yellow]]-painted [[AT-6 Texan|SNJ]] aircraft flown by the U.S. Navy's [[Blue Angels#1940s|Blue Angels]] aerobatic team's shows in the late 1940s, \"Beetle Bomb\". In live shows Spike would acknowledge the applause with complete solemnity, saying \"Thank you, music lovers.\" An [[LP record|LP]] collection of twelve of these \"homicides\" was released by RCA (on its prestigious [[RCA Red Seal Records|Red Seal]] label) in 1971 as ''Spike Jones Is Murdering the Classics.'' They include such ''tours de force'' as Pal-Yat-Chee (''[[Pagliacci]]''), sung by the Hillbilly humorists [[Homer and Jethro]], Ponchielli's ''[[Dance of the Hours]]'', Tchaikovsky's ''[[None but the Lonely Heart (Tchaikovsky)|None but the Lonely Heart]]'', and Bizet's ''[[Carmen]]''.\n\nIn 1944 RCA Victor released his \"Spike Jones presents for the Kiddies\" version of Tchaikovsky's ''Nutcracker Suite'', in three 10 inch 78 rpm records, P-143, arrangement credited to Joe \"Country\" Washburne with lyrics by Foster Carling. It was released as a three 7 inch 45 rpm vinyl set in 1949 as WP-143 and as a one 45rpm extended play EPA-143 in 1952. An abridged and re-sequenced version is also included in the aforementioned 'classics' album, with the complete original version available on the CD collection ''Spiked: The Music of Spike Jones''.\n\n==Radio==\nAfter appearing as the house band on ''[[The Bob Burns Show]],'' Spike got his own radio show on [[NBC]], ''[[The Chase and Sanborn Hour|The Chase and Sanborn Program]]'', as [[Edgar Bergen]]'s summer replacement in 1945. [[Frances Langford]] was co-host and [[Groucho Marx]] was among the guests. The guest list for Jones's 1947\u201349 CBS program for [[Coca-Cola]] (originally ''The Spotlight Revue'', retitled ''The Spike Jones Show'' for its final season) included [[Frankie Laine]], [[Mel Torme]], Peter Lorre, [[Don Ameche]] and [[Burl Ives]]. [[Frank Sinatra]] appeared on the show in October 1948, and [[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]] in May 1949. Jones's resident \"girlsinger\" during this period was [[Dorothy Shay]], \"The Park Avenue Hillbillie.\" One of the announcers on Jones's CBS show was the young [[Mike Wallace]]. Writers included Eddie Maxwell, Eddie Brandt and [[Jay Sommers]]. The final program in the series was broadcast in June 1949.\n\n==Spike Jones and His Other Orchestra==\nWhile Jones enjoyed the fame and prosperity, he was annoyed that nobody seemed to see beyond the craziness. Determined to show the world that he was capable of producing legitimate \"pretty\" music, he formed a second group in 1946. Spike Jones and His Other Orchestra played lush arrangements of dance hits. This alternate group played nightclub engagements and was an artistic success, but the paying public preferred the City Slickers and stayed away. Jones wound up paying some of the band's expenses out of his own pocket. Some of the City Slickers band members appeared and recorded with the Other Orchestra, but most of the Other Orchestra personnel consisted of \"serious,\" accomplished studio musicians from the Los Angeles area.\n\nThe one outstanding recording by the Other Orchestra is \"Laura\", which features a serious first half (played exquisitely by the Other Orchestra) and a manic second half (played hilariously by the City Slickers).\n\nJones' son, Spike Jones Jr., called attention to the precision of his father's most outlandish musical arrangements: \"One of the things that people don't realize about Dad's kind of music is, when you replace a C-sharp with a gunshot, it has to be a C-sharp gunshot or it sounds awful.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-05-08-bk-55045-story.html |title=Brevity's Raincheck |date=May 8, 1994 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=October 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Movies==\nIn 1940, Jones had an uncredited bandleading part in the [[Dead End Kids]] film ''Give Us Wings'', appearing on camera for about four seconds.\n\nAs the band's fame grew, Hollywood producers hired the Slickers as a specialty act for feature films, including ''[[Thank Your Lucky Stars (1943 film)|Thank Your Lucky Stars]]'' (1943), ''[[Meet the People]]'' (1944), ''[[Bring on the Girls (film)|Bring on the Girls]]'' (1945), ''[[Breakfast in Hollywood]]'' (1946) and ''[[Variety Girl]]'' (1947). Jones was set to team with [[Abbott and Costello]] for a [[1954 in film|1954]] [[Universal Pictures]] comedy, but when Lou Costello withdrew for medical reasons, Universal replaced the comedy team with look-alikes [[Hugh O'Brian]] and [[Buddy Hackett]], and promoted Jones to the leading role. The finished film, ''[[Fireman Save My Child (1954 film)|Fireman Save My Child]]'', turned out to be Spike Jones's only top-billed theatrical movie.\n\n==Soundies==\nIn 1942, the Jones gang worked on numerous [[Soundies]], musical shorts similar to later [[music video]]s which were shown on coin-operated projectors in arcades, malt shops, and taverns. The band appeared on camera under their own name in four of the Soundies (\"Clink! Clink! Another Drink\", \"Pass the Biscuits, Mirandy\", \"The Sheik of Araby\", and \"Blacksmith Song\"), and, according to musicologist Mark Cantor, provided background music for at least thirteen others. [[Mel Blanc]], the voice of [[Bugs Bunny]] and other [[Warner Brothers]] cartoon characters, performed a drunken, hiccuping verse for 1942's \"Clink! Clink!

Polka\").\n\n==Television==\n[[File:Spike Jones Bill Dana Helen Grayco Spike Jones Show 1960.JPG|thumb|180px|Jones and his wife, [[Helen Grayco]], with [[Bill Dana (comedian)|Bill Dana]] in 1960. Dana wrote and produced the summer replacement show, as well as performed on it.]]\nJones saw the potential of television and filmed two half-hour pilot films, ''Foreign Legion'' and ''Wild Bill Hiccup'', in the summer of 1950. Veteran comedy director [[Edward F. Cline|Eddie Cline]] worked on both, but neither was successful. The band fared much better on live television, where their spontaneous antics and crazy visual gags guaranteed the viewers a good time. Spike usually dressed in a suit with an enormous check pattern and was seen leaping around playing a washboard, cowbells, a suite of klaxons and foghorns, then xylophone, then shooting a pistol. The band starred in variety shows, such as ''[[The Colgate Comedy Hour]]'' (1951, 1955)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/C/htmlC/colgatecomed/colgatecomed.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009220817/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/C/htmlC/colgatecomed/colgatecomed.htm|url-status=dead|title=The Museum of Broadcast Communications.

Jones and his City Slickers also appeared on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Ford Show|The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford]]'' in the episode which aired on November 15, 1956.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ernieford.com/TEFTVGuests.htm |title=The Ford Show Guest Guide |publisher=ernieford.com |accessdate=November 23, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128190749/http://ernieford.com/TEFTVGuests.htm |archivedate=November 28, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>  In 1990, [[BBC Two|BBC2]] screened six compilation shows from these broadcasts; they were subsequently aired on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] stations.\n\n==Later years==\nThe decline of big bands and the rise of [[rock and roll]] in the early 1950s hurt Spike Jones' repertoire. Early rock songs were ''already'' novelties, and Jones could not satirise them the same way he had lampooned \"Cocktails for Two\", \"Chloe\" or \"Laura\". He played rock music for laughs when he presented \"for the first time on television, the bottom half of [[Elvis Presley]]!\" This was the cue for a pair of pants\u2014inhabited by dwarf actor [[Billy Barty]]\u2014to scamper across the stage.<ref>{{cite book |last=Young |first=Jordan R. |year=2005 |title=Spike Jones Off the Record: The Man Who Murdered Music |edition=3rd |location=Albany |publisher=BearManor Media |isbn=1-59393-012-7}}</ref>\n\nJones was always prepared to adapt to changing tastes. In 1950, when America was nostalgically looking back at the 1920s, Jones recorded a straight album of Charleston arrangements. In 1953, he responded to the growing market for children's records, with tunes aimed directly at kids (like \"Socko, the Smallest Snowball\"). Jones had become increasingly unhappy at RCA Victor due to management interfering with his choice of repertoire and other matters, and he left the label in 1955. His later recordings were issued by [[Verve Records|Verve]], [[Liberty Records|Liberty]] and [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] In 1956, Jones supervised an album of Christmas songs, many of which were performed seriously. In 1957, noting the television success of [[Lawrence Welk]] and his dance band, he revamped his own act for television. Gone was the old City Slickers mayhem, replaced by a more straightforward big-band sound, with tongue-in-cheek comic moments. The new band was known as Spike Jones and the Band that Plays for Fun. The last City Slickers record was the LP ''[[Dinner Music for People Who Aren't Very Hungry]]''. The whole field of comedy records changed from musical satires to spoken-word comedy ([[Bob Newhart]], [[Mort Sahl]], [[Stan Freberg]]). Spike Jones adapted to this, too; most of his later albums are spoken-word comedy, including the horror-genre sendup ''[[Spike Jones in Stereo]]'' (1959) and the send-up of television programs of the period in ''Omnibust'' (1960). Jones remained topical to the last: his final group, Spike Jones's New Band, recorded four LPs of brassy renditions of pop-folk tunes of the 1960s (including \"Washington Square\" and \"The Ballad of Jed Clampett\"). One of his New Band tracks in 1964 was a cover of \"[[Dominique]]\", a hit by [[The Singing Nun]], in which he not only plays part of the melody on a [[banjo]] but melds the melody successfully with \"[[When the Saints Go Marching In]]!\"\n\nJones was a lifelong heavy smoker, reportedly 4-5 packs a day, and eventually he developed [[emphysema]]. Never a very healthy person, his health would deteriorate to the point where he had to use an oxygen tank both offstage and onstage, and he was confined to a seat behind his drum set. In spite of his illness, he continued smoking for the rest of his life and he died in May 1965 at the age of 53. He is buried in [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City|Holy Cross Cemetery]], [[Culver City, California]].\n\n==Influence==\nThere is a clear line of influence from [[Harry Reser]]'s 1920s hot-comic \"Six Jumping Jacks\" band (whose drummer and vocalist was the distinctive [[Tom Stacks]], \"The Voice With a Smile\"), the [[Hoosier Hot Shots]], [[Freddie Fisher (musician)|Freddie Fisher]] and his [[Schnickelfritz Band|Schnickelfritzers]], and the [[Marx Brothers]] to Spike Jones&nbsp;\u2014 and to [[Stan Freberg]], [[Gerard Hoffnung]], [[Peter Schickele]]'s [[P.D.Q. Bach]], [[The Goons]], [[Joe Raposo]], [[Mr. Bungle]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band]], [[Oingo Boingo|The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo]], and [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]]. [[Billy Barty]] appeared in Yankovic's film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' and a video based on the movie. According to David Wild's review in Rolling Stone Magazine, [[Elvis Costello]]'s 1989 Album \"[[Spike (Elvis Costello album)|Spike]]\" was named partly in tribute to Jones.\n\nSyndicated radio personality [[Dr. Demento]] regularly features Jones' music on his program of comedy and novelty tracks. Jones is mentioned in [[The Band]]'s song, \"[[Up on Cripple Creek]]\". (The song's protagonist's paramour states of Jones: \"I can't take the way he sings, but I love to hear him talk.\") Novelist [[Thomas Pynchon]] is an admirer and wrote the liner notes for a 1994 reissue, ''Spiked!'' (BMG Catalyst). A scene in the romantic comedy ''[[I.Q. (film)|I.Q.]]'' shows a man demonstrating the sound of his new stereo to [[Meg Ryan]]'s character by playing a record of Jones' music.\n\nIn 1974, Tony Levin (future bass player for King Crimson), recording under the name, The Clams, released a Spike Jones tribute of him giving the songs, \"Close To You\", by The Carpenters, and, \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\", by Roberta Flack, the Jones treatment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/thb404f|title=The Clams - Close To You|website=45cat.com|accessdate=October 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1986, the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[synthpop]] group [[Telex (band)|Telex]] paid homage to Spike Jones in their album ''Looney Tunes'', with a song named after him. The intro of that song is a part of the intro from ''Camptown Races''.\n\nIn 1997, singers [[Artie Schroeck]] and [[Linda November]] directed a production in [[Atlantic City]] entitled \"The New City Slickers Present a Tribute to Spike Jones\", with a band that attempted to re-create the style and humor of Jones' music.<ref name=musician>{{cite news|title=He's a serious musician in search of funny sounds|url=http://articles.philly.com/1997-09-26/entertainment/25552440_1_spike-jones-music-big-bands|date=September 26, 1997|author=Lloyd, Jack|work=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]|accessdate=June 17, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527140520/http://articles.philly.com/1997-09-26/entertainment/25552440_1_spike-jones-music-big-bands |archivedate=May 27, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Celebrating Spike Jones at Harrah's|date=September 21, 1997|author=Alexander, Randy|work=[[The Times (New Jersey)|The Times]]}}</ref>\n\nBoth [[Spike Milligan]] and [[Spike Jonze]] were named in reference to Jones.\n\n==Discography==\n* ''Spike Jones Plays the Charleston'' (1950)\n* ''Bottoms Up, Polka'' (1952)\n* ''Spike Jones Murders Carmen and Kids the Classics'' (1953)\n* ''[[Dinner Music For People Who Aren't Very Hungry]]'' (1956)\n* ''Spike Jones Presents a Xmas Spectacular'' (1956) (reissued as ''It's a Spike Jones Christmas'' and ''Let's Sing a Song of Christmas'')\n* ''Hi Fi Polka Party'' (1957)\n* ''[[Spike Jones in Stereo]]'' (1959) (reissued as ''Spike Jones in Hi Fi'')\n* ''Omnibust'' (1960)\n* ''60 Years of \"Music America Hates Best\"'' (1960)\n* ''Thank You Music Lovers!''
