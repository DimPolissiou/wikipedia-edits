League]] (NFL). Over the course of his 38 years in the NFL, his teams competed in seven [[Super Bowl]]s (winning four times), beginning with the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] in 1966, [[Miami Dolphins]] in 1972 and 1973, [[Washington Redskins]] in 1982, 1983, and 1987, and the [[San Diego Chargers]] in 1994. He was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 2018.\n\n==Early life and playing career==\nBeathard was born in [[Zanesville, Ohio]], before moving to [[El Segundo, California]], at the age of four. He attended [[El Segundo High School]] but did not begin playing football until his sophomore year, as a [[Halfback (American football)|tailback]]. In college, he accepted a scholarship to play football for [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]], but returned home after summer practices after feeling homesick. He then enrolled at [[El Camino Junior College]] for a year before enrolling at [[Cal Poly Mustangs football|Cal Poly]], where he played football as a back-up running back and later the starting [[quarterback]] and [[defensive back]], leading Cal Poly to back-to-back 9\u20131 seasons. He went undrafted in 1959 and had pre-season stints with two professional teams, but was unable to find a spot, spending his early post-college years playing [[Semi-professional|semi-pro]] football and working various non-football jobs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/1981/04/12/bobby-beathard/7039d520-1ef8-4142-ba40-a418948c05f5/|title=BOBBY BEATHARD|first1=Paul|last1=Attner|first2=Leonard|last2=Shapiro|date=April 12, 1981|publisher=|access-date=December 25, 2017|via=www.WashingtonPost.com}}</ref>\n\n==Executive career==\n===Scout===\nBeathard first joined pro football in 1963 as a part-time scout for the Kansas City Chiefs. He left the Chiefs briefly to scout for the [[American Football League]] and returned to Kansas City full-time in 1966. He earned his first AFL championship ring as a member of the 1966 Chiefs organization.\n\nBeathard served as a scout for the [[Atlanta Falcons]] from 1968 through 1971. In 1972, Beathard was named director of player personnel for the Miami Dolphins. The Dolphins won the following two Super Bowls.\n\n===General manager===\nIn 1978, the Washington Redskins named Beathard general manager. During his tenure in Washington, Beathard, [[Russ Grimm]], [[Joe Gibbs]], and [[Art Monk]] helped lead the Redskins to three Super Bowl appearances and two championships. In addition, the 1991 championship team for the Redskins was primarily composed of players that Beathard had brought to the Redskins. Prominent draft picks for the Redskins under his tenure include [[Art Monk]], [[Mark May]], [[Russ Grimm]], [[Dexter Manley]], [[Charlie Brown (wide receiver)|Charlie Brown]], [[Darrell Green]], [[Charles Mann (American football)|Charles Mann]], and [[Gary Clark]]. Beathard resigned prior to the [[1989 NFL Draft]], and spent the year as a studio analyst with ''[[NFL on NBC]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Doerschuk |first1=Steve |title=Bobby Beathard had to fight his way to Hog Heaven |url=https://www.cantonrep.com/sports/20180731/bobby-beathard-had-to-fight-his-way-to-hog-heaven/1 |website=CantonRep.com |accessdate=7 January 2020}}</ref> In 1990, Beathard joined the [[San Diego Chargers]] as general manager.

On September 6, 1905, Albert D. Robinson of Lynn, Massachusetts submitted his patent for an Electric Candy-Spinning Machine. The patent was for a combination of an electronic starter, motor-driven rotatable bowl, that maintained heating efficiently. By May 1907 he transferred the rights to the General Electric Company of New York. His patent still remains today as the basic Cotton Candy machine.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLAAgp4QsAwC&pg=PA2226&dq=%22albert+d+robinson%22+electrical+patent&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi-vdK0ztbnAhX6lXIEHX3LCqAQ6AEwAHoECAYQAg#v=onepage&q=candy-%20spinning%20machine&f=false|title=Official Gazette of the United States Patent Office|date=1907|publisher=The Office|language=en}}</ref>\n\nJoseph Lascaux, a dentist from [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], invented a similar cotton candy machine in 1921.

Heaters near the rim of the head melt the sugar, which is squeezed out through tiny holes by [[centrifugal force]]. Colored sugar packaged specially for the process is milled with melting characteristics and a crystal size optimized for the head and heated holes; granulated sugar used in baking contains fine crystals which spin out unmelted, while rock sugar crystals are too large to properly contact the heater, slowing the production of cotton candy.\n\nThe molten sugar solidifies in the air and is caught in a larger bowl which totally surrounds the spinning head. Left to operate for a period, the cotton-like product builds up on the inside walls of the larger bowl, at which point machine operators twirl a stick or cone around the rim of the large catching bowl, gathering the sugar strands into portions which are served on stick or cone, or in plastic bags. As the sugar reserve bowl empties, the operator recharges it with more feedstock. The product is sensitive to humidity, and in humid summer locales, the process can be messy and sticky.\n\nModern innovations in cotton-candy equipment include vending machines which automatically produce single servings of the product, developed in [[Taiwan]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vendever.com/resources/VT_Article_April+2010.pdf |title=VendEver Rolls Out Cotton Candy Machine |accessdate=2012-12-17 |work=Vending Times |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426064024/http://www.vendever.com/resources/VT_Article_April%2B2010.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-26 }}</ref> and lighted or glowing sticks.\n\n== Flavoring ==\n[[File:Pink and blue cotton candy.jpg|thumb|Blue and pink cotton candy]]\nThe source material for candy mesh is usually both colored and flavored. When spun, cotton candy is white because it is made from sugar, but adding dye or coloring transforms the color. Originally, cotton candy was just white.   In the US, cotton candy is available in a wide variety of flavors, but two flavor-blend colors predominate \u2013 'blue raspberry' and 'pink vanilla'{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}, both originally formulated by the Gold Medal brand (which uses the names 'Boo Blue' and 'Silly Nilly'). Cotton candy may come out purple when mixed. Cotton candy machines were notoriously unreliable until Gold Medal's invention of a sprung base in 1949 - since then, they have manufactured nearly all commercial cotton candy machines and much of the cotton candy in the US.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1738/who-invented-cotton-candy |title=Who invented cotton candy? |publisher=The Straight Dope |date=2000-02-07 |accessdate=2017-03-16}}</ref>\n\nTypically, once spun, cotton candy is only marketed by color. Absent a clear name other than 'blue', the distinctive taste of the blue raspberry flavor mix has gone on to become a compound flavor that some other foods (gum, ice cream, rock candy, fluoride toothpaste) occasionally borrow (\"cotton-candy flavored ice cream\") to invoke the nostalgia of cotton candy.  Pink [[bubble gum]] went through a similar transition from specific branded product to a generic flavor that transcended the original confection, and 'bubble gum flavor' often shows up in the same product categories as 'cotton candy flavor'.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n== Machines ==\nIn 1978, the first automated machine was used for the production of cotton candy. Since then, the creations and innovations of this machine have become greater and greater. They range in sizes from counter-top accessible to party and carnival size. Modern machines that are made for commercial use can hold up to {{convert|3|lbs}} of sugar and have compartments for storage of extra flavors. The rotating bowl at the top spins at 3,450 revolutions per minute.<ref>{{cite web|last=Venzon |first=Christine |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/edible-innovations/cotton-candy3.htm |title=How Stuff Works Inc. \"Cotton Candy Machines and Marketing Today.\" Howstuffworks.com.

Wharton, and first introduced to a wide audience at the [[1904 World's Fair]] as \"Fairy Floss\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mcottoncandy.html |title=Cotton Candy |publisher=The Straight Dope |date=February 7, 2000 |accessdate=November 30, 2011}}</ref> with great success, selling 68,655 boxes at 25\u00a2 ({{Inflation|index=US|value=0.25|start_year=1904|fmt=eq|r=2}}) per box. On September 6, 1905, Albert D. Robinson of Lynn, Massachusetts submitted his patent for an Electric Candy-Spinning Machine. The patent was for a combination of an electronic starter, motor-driven rotatable bowl, that maintained heating efficiently. By May 1907 he transferred the rights to the General Electric Company of New York. His patent still remains today as the basic Cotton Candy machine.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLAAgp4QsAwC&pg=PA2226&dq=%22albert+d+robinson%22+electrical+patent&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi-vdK0ztbnAhX6lXIEHX3LCqAQ6AEwAHoECAYQAg#v=onepage&q=candy-%20spinning%20machine&f=false|title=Official Gazette of the United States Patent Office|date=1907|publisher=The Office|language=en}}</ref>\n\nJoseph Lascaux, a dentist from [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], invented a similar cotton candy machine in 1921.

Heaters near the rim of the head melt the sugar, which is squeezed out through tiny holes by [[centrifugal force]]. Colored sugar packaged specially for the process is milled with melting characteristics and a crystal size optimized for the head and heated holes; granulated sugar used in baking contains fine crystals which spin out unmelted, while rock sugar crystals are too large to properly contact the heater, slowing the production of cotton candy.\n\nThe molten sugar solidifies in the air and is caught in a larger bowl which totally surrounds the spinning head. Left to operate for a period, the cotton-like product builds up on the inside walls of the larger bowl, at which point machine operators twirl a stick or cone around the rim of the large catching bowl, gathering the sugar strands into portions which are served on stick or cone, or in plastic bags. As the sugar reserve bowl empties, the operator recharges it with more feedstock. The product is sensitive to humidity, and in humid summer locales, the process can be messy and sticky.\n\nModern innovations in cotton-candy equipment include vending machines which automatically produce single servings of the product, developed in [[Taiwan]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vendever.com/resources/VT_Article_April+2010.pdf |title=VendEver Rolls Out Cotton Candy Machine |accessdate=2012-12-17 |work=Vending Times |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426064024/http://www.vendever.com/resources/VT_Article_April%2B2010.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-26 }}</ref> and lighted or glowing sticks.\n\n== Flavoring ==\n[[File:Pink and blue cotton candy.jpg|thumb|Blue and pink cotton candy]]\nThe source material for candy mesh is usually both colored and flavored. When spun, cotton candy is white because it is made from sugar, but adding dye or coloring transforms the color. Originally, cotton candy was just white.   In the US, cotton candy is available in a wide variety of flavors, but two flavor-blend colors predominate \u2013 'blue raspberry' and 'pink vanilla'{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}, both originally formulated by the Gold Medal brand (which uses the names 'Boo Blue' and 'Silly Nilly'). Cotton candy may come out purple when mixed. Cotton candy machines were notoriously unreliable until Gold Medal's invention of a sprung base in 1949 - since then, they have manufactured nearly all commercial cotton candy machines and much of the cotton candy in the US.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1738/who-invented-cotton-candy |title=Who invented cotton candy? |publisher=The Straight Dope |date=2000-02-07 |accessdate=2017-03-16}}</ref>\n\nTypically, once spun, cotton candy is only marketed by color. Absent a clear name other than 'blue', the distinctive taste of the blue raspberry flavor mix has gone on to become a compound flavor that some other foods (gum, ice cream, rock candy, fluoride toothpaste) occasionally borrow (\"cotton-candy flavored ice cream\") to invoke the nostalgia of cotton candy.  Pink [[bubble gum]] went through a similar transition from specific branded product to a generic flavor that transcended the original confection, and 'bubble gum flavor' often shows up in the same product categories as 'cotton candy flavor'.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n== Machines ==\nIn 1978, the first automated machine was used for the production of cotton candy. Since then, the creations and innovations of this machine have become greater and greater. They range in sizes from counter-top accessible to party and carnival size. Modern machines that are made for commercial use can hold up to {{convert|3|lbs}} of sugar and have compartments for storage of extra flavors.

Parasurama entrusted 'Kshethra karyam' (Administration of the Temple) with seven Potti families - Koopakkara Potti, Vanchiyoor Athiyara Potti, Kollur Athiyara Potti, Muttavila Potti, Karuva Potti, Neythasseri Potti and Sreekaryathu Potti. King Adithya Vikrama of Vanchi (Venad) was directed by Parasurama to do 'Paripalanam' (Protection) of the Temple. Parasurama gave the Tantram of the Temple to Tharananallur Namboothiripad. This legend is narrated in detail in 'Kerala Mahathmyam' which forms part of 'Brahmanda Puranam'.\n \nAnother version regarding the consecration of the Main Idol of the Temple relates to the legendary sage Vilvamangalathu Swamiyar. Swamiyar, who resided near [[Ananthapura Lake Temple|Ananthapuram Temple]] in Kasaragod District, prayed to Lord Vishnu for his ''[[Dar\u015bana|darshan]]'' or \"auspicious sight\". The Lord is believed to have come in the guise of a little boy who was mischievous. The boy defiled the Idol which was kept for Puja. The sage became enraged at this and chased away the boy who disappeared before him. Realizing the boy was no ordinary mortal, the sage wept for forgiveness and asked for another darshan as a sign. He heard a voice say \"If you want to see me come to the Anathavana (the unending forest or ananthakadu). After a long search, when he was walking on the banks of [[Laccadive Sea]], he heard a ''[[pulaya]]'' lady warning her child that she would throw him in Ananthankadu. The moment the Swami heard the word Ananthankadu he was delighted. He proceeded to Ananthankadu based on the directions of the lady of whom he enquired. The Sage reached Ananthankadu searching for the boy. There he saw the boy merging into an Iluppa tree (Indian Butter Tree). The tree fell down and became Anantha Sayana Moorti (Vishnu reclining on the celestial snake [[Ananta (infinite)|Anantha]]). But the edifice that the Lord assumed was of an extraordinarily large size, with His head at Thiruvattar near Thuckalay Tamil Nadu, Body or Udal at Thiruvananthapuram, and lotus-feet at Thrippadapuram near Kulathoor and Technopark (Thrippappur), making him some eight miles in length. The Sage requested the Lord to shrink to a smaller proportion that would be thrice the length of his staff. Immediately the Lord shrank to the form of the Idol that is seen at present in the Temple. But even then many Iluppa trees obstructed a complete vision of the Lord. The Sage saw the Lord in three parts \u2013 thirumukham, thiruvudal and thrippadam. Swami prayed to Padmanabha to be forgiven. The Swami offered Rice Kanji and Uppumanga (salted mango pieces) in a coconut shell to the Perumal which he obtained from the pulaya woman. The spot where the Sage had darsan of the Lord belonged to Koopakkara Potti and Karuva Potti. With the assistance of the reigning King and some Brahmin households a Temple was constructed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spst.in/temple-history/ |title=Temple History}}</ref> The Ananthankadu Nagaraja Temple still exists to the north west of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple. The Samadhi (final resting place) of the Swamiyar exists to the west of the Padmanabha Temple. A Krishna Temple was built over the Samadhi. This Temple, known as Vilvamangalam Sri Krishna Swami Temple, belongs to Thrissur [[Naduvil Madhom]].<ref name=\"Aswathi\" />\n\n===Travancore royal family===\nIn the first half of the 18th century, in line with [[Nair|matrilineal customs]], Anizham Thirunal [[Marthanda Varma]], succeeded his uncle Rama Varma as king at the age of 23. He successfully suppressed the 700-year-old stranglehold of the [[Ettuveetil Pillamar]] (\"Lords of the Eight Houses\") and his cousins following the discovery of conspiracies which the lords were involved in against the royal house of Travancore (There are various legends and disputes about this stories but overall he took control and centralized the rule). The last major renovation of the Padmanabhaswamy temple commenced immediately after Anizham Thirunal's accession to the musnud and the idol was reconsecrated in 906 [[Malayalam calendar|ME]] (1731 CE). On 17 January 1750, Anizham Thirunal surrendered the kingdom of [[Travancore]] to Padmanabha Swamy, the deity at the temple, and pledged that he and his descendants would be vassals or agents of the deity who would serve the kingdom as ''Padmanabha Dasa''.<ref name=\"Temples of Kerala\" /> Since then, the name of every Travancore king was preceded by the title Sree Padmanabha Dasa; the female members of the royal family were called Sree Padmanabha Sevinis. The donation of the king to Padmanabhaswamy was known as Thrippadi-danam. The final wishes of Anizham Thirunal on his passing at the age of 53 clearly delineated the historical relationship between the Maharaja and the temple: \"That no deviation whatsoever should be made in regard to the dedication of the kingdom to Padmanabhaswamy and that all future territorial acquisitions should be made over to the Devaswom.\"\n\n==Temple structure==\n[[File:Thiruvanthapuram Temple Approach.JPG|thumb|200px|The approach road to the Padmanabhaswamy temple]]\n\n===Main shrine===\nIn the ''[[sanctum sanctorum]]'', Padmanabha reclines on the serpent ''[[Ananta (infinite)|Anantha]] '' or ''Adi Sesha''.<ref>{{Citation |last=Jayashanker|first1=S|title=Temples of Kerala|year=1999}}</ref> The serpent has five hoods facing inwards, signifying contemplation.

Thiruvambadi shrine enjoys an independent status and predates the shrine of Padmanabha. Thiruvambadi shrine has its own namaskara mandapam, bali stones and flagmast. The Lord of Thiruvambadi is Parthasarathi, the Divine Charioteer of [[Arjuna]]. The granite idol of the Lord of Thiruvambadi was brought from Gujarat by 72 families of Vrishni Vamsa Kshatriyas. As these Vrishnies belong to the lineage of Lord Krishna, they are known as Krishnan vakakkar. The two-armed granite idol, with one hand holding the whip and the other resting on the left thigh holding the conch close to it, is in standing posture. On [[Ekadasi]] days the Lord is dressed and decorated as [[Mohini]]. There are also shrines for [[Rama]] accompanied by [[Sita]], [[Lakshmana]] and [[Hanuman]], Vishwaksena (the Nirmalyadhari of Vishnu and Remover of Obstacles), [[Vyasa]], [[Ganapati]], [[Sasta]], and Kshetrapala (who guards the temple).

The major festivals are bi-annual. The ''Alpashy'' festival which is in October/November and the ''[[Panguni Uthiram|Panguni]]'' festival which is in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] month Panguni, March/April, lasts for 10 days each. On the ninth day the Maharajah of Travancore, in his capacity as Thrippappoor Mooppan, escorts the deities to the vettakkalam for Pallivetta. Centuries back, the Pallivetta procession was said to pass through Kaithamukku, Kuthiravattom (Kunnumpuram), [[Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram Temple|Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram]] and Putharikkandam. The festivals culminate with the ''Aarat'' (holy bath) procession to the [[Shankumugham Beach]]. The word ''Aarat'' refers to the purificatory immersion of the deities of the temple in sea. This event takes place in the evening. The Maharajah of Travancore escorts the ''Aarat'' procession on foot. The festival idols \"Utsava Vigrahas\" of Padmanabhaswamy, Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami are given a ritual bath in the sea, after the prescribed [[puja (Hinduism)|puja]]s. After this ceremony, the idols are taken back to the temple in a procession that is lit by traditional torches, marking the conclusion of the festival.<ref name=\"Aswathi\" />\n\nA major annual festival related to Padmanabha temple is the ''[[Navaratri]]'' festival. The idols of [[Saraswati]] Amman, Mun Uditha Nangai ([[Parasakti]] who appeared before Saraswati, [[Lakshmi]] and Parvati to help them identify their husbands who had been transformed into infants by the power of chastity of [[Anasuya]]) and Kumara Swami ([[Murugan]]) are brought to the ''Kuthira malika'' palace in front of Padmanabha temple as a procession. This festival lasts for 9 days. The famous Swathi music festival is held every year during this festival.\n\n[[File:Aaratu3.jpg|thumb|upright|Big idol of Pandavas displayed during Panguni festival]]\n\nThe biggest festival in this temple is ''laksha deepam'', which means hundred thousand (or one [[lakh]]) lamps. This festival is unique and commences once in 6 years. Prior to this festival, chanting of prayers and recitation of three [[vedas]] is done for 56 days (Murajapam). On the last day, hundred thousand oil lamps are lit in and around the temple premises. The next ''laksha deepam'' is slated in January 2020.\n\n===Priests===\nTemples where 'Swamiyar Pushpanjali' is conducted are claimants to extra sanctity. Sannyasins from [[Naduvil Madhom]] and Munchira Madhom do pushpanjali (flower worship) daily to Padmanabha, Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami. Tharananallur Nambuthiripads of Iranjalakkuda are the Tantris of the Temple. The Nambies, altogether four in number, are the Chief Priests of the Temple. Two Nambies - Periya Nambi and Panchagavyathu Nambi - are allotted to Padmanabha and one Nambi each to Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami. The Nambies hail from either side of the Chandragiri River.<ref name=\"Aswathi\" />\n\n<br />\n\n=== Temple entry ===\nIn line with the [[Temple Entry Proclamation]], only those who profess the Hindu faith are permitted entry to the temple and devotees have to strictly follow the dress code.<ref>Pippa De Bruyn, Keith Bain, David Allardice ''Frommer's India'' 2010 Page 281 \"Padmanabhaswamy Temple - This Tamil style Vishnu temple, said to be the largest in Kerala, may be off-limits to non-Hindus, but the \"temple guides\" manage to target foreigners with great ease, leading them to the obligatory spots from. \"</ref>\n\n==Temple management==\n{{Inline citations|date=October 2019}}\nThe Padmanabhaswamy Temple and its property were controlled by the [[Ettara Yogam]] (King and Council of Eight) with the assistance of [[Ettuveetil Pillamar]] (\"Lords of the Eight Houses\"). The Ettara Yogam consists of Pushpanjali Swamiyar, six member Thiruvananthapurathu Sabha, Sabhanjithan (Secretary) and Arachan (Maharaja of Travancore). Thiruvananthapurathu Sabha was primarily responsible for the administration of the Temple. Koopakkara Potti, Vanchiyoor Athiyara Potti, Kollur Athiyara Potti, Muttavila Potti, Karuva Potti and Neythasseri Potti are the members of the Sabha. The Pushpanjali Swamiyar presides over the meetings of the Sabha. Sreekaryathu Potti is the Sabhanjithan of the Sabha.<ref>Sri Padmanabha Swamy Kshethram Charithra Rekhakalilude by S. Uma Maheswari</ref> Any decision taken by the Sabha can be implemented only if the Maharaja of Travancore approves of it.<ref>Charithram Kuricha Sree Padmanabha Swamy Kshethram by Dr MG Sasibhooshan and Dr RP Raja</ref> It is believed that eight members of Ettara Yogam (seven Potties and the Maharaja of Travancore) received their rights from Lord Parashurama Himself.\n\nIn the past, only the Swamiyars of the [[Naduvil Madhom]] were appointed as Pushpanjali Swamiyars by the [[Maharaja of Travancore]]. Anizham Thirunal [[Marthanda Varma]] curtailed the authority of Ettara Yogam and liquidated the powerful Ettuveetil Pillamar. Ettara Yogam became an advisory and assenting body thereafter. Besides Naduvil Madhom, Munchira Madhom got the right to appoint Pushpanjali Swamiyars during his reign. In the recent past, [[Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma]] gave Pushpanjali rights to the Swamiyars of Thrikkaikattu Madhom and Thekke Madhom as well. Though the Maharaja is the appointing authority of the Pushpanjali Swamiyar, the former must do a Vechu Namaskaram when he sees the Swamiyar. With the passing away of Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma in December 2013, his nephew [[Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma]] became the titular Maharaja of Travancore in January 2014. Like his predecessors, Moolam Thirunal also got concurrence from the Ettara Yogam before assuming the title 'Maharaja'. In the presence of the Maharaja designate, the Yogathil Pottimar and the Tantri, the Pushpanjali Swamiyar Maravanchery Thekkedathu Neelakanta Bharatikal signed on the Neettu (Order) of the Ettara Yogam accepting Moolam Thirunal as ''Chirava Mootha Thiruvadi'' (Maharaja of Travancore) and ''Thrippappoor Mootha Thiruvadi'' (Protector of the Temple). This ceremony took place at Kulasekhara Mandapam in Padmanabha Swamy Temple. [[Revathi Thirunal Balagopal Varma]], grandson of Maharani Regent Pooradom Thirunal [[Sethu Lakshmi Bayi]], is the titular Elayaraja of Travancore.\n\n==Extant temple records==\n{{Inline citations|date=October 2019}}\nA pertinent event in the long history of the temple was the construction of a \"granta-pura\" (record-room) within the temple compound itself around 1425 A.D. by the then Venad King Veera Iravi Iravi Varma, to store the \"Mathilakam\" (within-the-walls) records, as the then existing temple records were known.<ref name=\"frontline.in\">{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2815/stories/20110729281512800.htm|title=Key to the past|publisher=}}</ref> A major portion of those records (over 3000 'Cadjan' leaf-records) from the Mathikalam had been donated later to the Archives Department in 1867 at the time of the formation of the latter. Each of these Cadjan leaf-records, which have been compiled over thousands of years, contains 10,000 documentations according to [[R._Nagaswamy]], noted archeologist and historian, totaling over 30 crores of records. Despite their cultural value, only a minuscule portion of these grantas (bundles) of cadjan leaf records, written mostly in ancient scripts of proto-[[Tamil script|Tamil]] and archaic-Malayalam, have been deciphered. The translations of this section of manuscripts by some scholars serve as a rare but very inadequate primary source material on the temple and its rich traditions.\n\nThe rest of these Mathilakam documents - segregated under 70 \"heads\" - is still lying idle with the Archives Department. According to Aswathi Thirunal Gouri Lakshmi Bayi, a member of the Travancore Royal Family and author of a book on the temple, from a very early period in recorded history the temple had employed two kinds of 'record writers'. One group was to record the proceedings and transactions of the Ettarayogam, a council of temple administrators, that included the then king. The other was to write and preserve the records of the day-to-day functioning of the temple, maintain correct accounts of the temple-treasury, and of temple-revenue-collections and temple-expenditure, and as well as write down all the other records, connected with the functioning of the temple.\n\n==Temple assets==\n{{Main article|Padmanabhaswamy Temple treasure}}\n{{wikinews|Hidden treasure worth billions of dollars discovered in Indian temple}}\nThe temple and its assets belong to Lord Padmanabhaswamy, and were for a long time controlled by a trust, headed by the [[Travancore royal family|Travancore Royal family]].

While vault B has been unopened over centuries, A was possibly opened in the 1930s, and vaults C to F have been opened from time to time over recent years. The two priests of the temple, the 'Periya Nambi' and the 'Thekkedathu Nambi', are the custodians of the four vaults, C to F, which are opened periodically. The Supreme Court had directed that \"the existing practices, procedures, and rituals\" of the temple be followed while opening vaults C to F and using the articles inside, while Vaults A and B would be opened only for the purpose of making an inventory of the articles and then closed. The review of the temple's underground vaults was undertaken by a seven-member panel appointed by the [[Supreme Court of India]] to generate an inventory, leading to the enumeration of a vast collection of articles that are traditionally kept under lock and key.

The small group of people including the King and the priests found a granary-sized structure almost full with mostly gold and some silver coins and jewels. Surmounted on top of it were hundreds of pure gold pots. There were four coffers filled with gold coins as well. Also found was a larger chest fixed to the ground with six sections in it.

Despite opposition from the Royal Family and the Tantries of the Temple, he pulled out a stone Yantra from the nearby Marthandan Madhom Palace and did pooja on it for several days. The Tantries explained that the Yantram had no connection with the Padmanabhaswami Temple and that it was for the protection of the Palace. But the Amicus Curiae insisted on having it installed in the Sanctum Sanctorum of the Temple. Due to severe opposition from the Tantries the Yantram remains where it was. Every morning, Lord Padmanabha is to be awakened only by blowing the conch shell and chanting the Sripada Sooktham. But the Amicus Curiae introduced the daily rendering of Venkatesa Suprabhatam to awaken the Lord. The Supreme Court requested the Tantri to take the final decision on whether the Suprabhatam could be sung. Following that, the Senior Tantri Nedumpilli Tharananalloor Parameswaran Namboothiripad directed the Temple authorities to stop the chanting of Suprabhatam forthwith, as it was causing 'Anya Mantra Yajana Dosham' (affliction due to worshipping the Deity with incompatible mantras) to the Presiding Deity and the Temple. As atonement for this dosham, the Tantri wants Vedic scholars to chant 12 'muras' each of Rig Veda and Yajur Veda. In his first report to the Supreme Court, the Amicus Curiae directed the Tantries to examine whether a [[Sri Yantra]] can be installed in the Sanctum Sanctorum, in front of the utsava moorthi.<ref>Report of the Amicus Curiae, Pg 63</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Padmanabhaswamy Temple treasure]]\n* [[Thirumal in Thiruvananthapuram]]\n* [[Temples of Kerala]]\n* [[Methan mani]], clock tower adjoining the temple\n* {{Portal-inline|India}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Padmanabhaswamy Temple}}\n* [http://spst.in/ Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple] (Official Website)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120416181925/http://www.sree-padmanabhaswamy.com/ Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple] (Information About Sree Padmanabhaswamy)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110709184850/http://www.247onlinenews.com/2011/07/padmanabhaswamy-temple-treasures-belong-to-royal-family-sankaracharya/ Padmanabhaswamy Temple treasures belong to royal family: Sankaracharya]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131227024931/http://mapkerala.in/page/padmanabhaswamy_temple Padmanabhaswamy temple tour information]\n* [https://templesblog.com/sree-padmanabhaswamy-temple-thiruvananthapuram Padmanabhaswamy temple tour information]\n{{Vishnu temples}}\n{{Hindu temples in Kerala}}\n{{Thiruvananthapuram}}\n{{Hinduism (compact)}}\n\n[[Category:Vishnu temples]]\n[[Category:Divya Desams]]\n[[Category:Hindu pilgrimage sites in India]]\n[[Category:Hindu temples in Thiruvananthapuram]]\n[[Category:Monuments of National Importance in Kerala]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Thiruvananthapuram]]\n[[Category:Vaishnavism]]\n[[Category:Travancore royal family]]\n[[Category:Tamilakam]]\n", "text_old": "{{manual|date=August 2017}}\n{{EngvarB|date=April 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2011}}\n{{Infobox temple\n| image              = TVM Padmanabhaswamy Temple.jpg\n| alt                =\n| caption            =\n| coordinates        ={{coord|8|28|58|N|76|56|37|E|type:landmark_region:IN|display=inline,title}}\n| country            = [[India]]\n| state              = [[Kerala]]\n| district           =\n| location           = [[Thiruvananthapuram]]\n| elevation_m        =\n| deity = [[Vishnu|Maha Vishnu]]\n| architecture       = Fusion of [[Architecture of Kerala|Kerala Architecture]] and [[ Architecture of Tamil Nadu|Tamil Architecture]]\n| inscriptions       =\n| creator            =\n| website            = [http://spst.in/ Official website]\n}}\n\n{{Vaishnavism}}\nThe '''Padmanabhaswamy temple''' is a [[Hindu temple]] located in [[Thiruvananthapuram]], the state capital of [[Kerala]], [[India]].

Parasurama entrusted 'Kshethra karyam' (Administration of the Temple) with seven Potti families - Koopakkara Potti, Vanchiyoor Athiyara Potti, Kollur Athiyara Potti, Muttavila Potti, Karuva Potti, Neythasseri Potti and Sreekaryathu Potti. King Adithya Vikrama of Vanchi (Venad) was directed by Parasurama to do 'Paripalanam' (Protection) of the Temple. Parasurama gave the Tantram of the Temple to Tharananallur Namboothiripad. This legend is narrated in detail in 'Kerala Mahathmyam' which forms part of 'Brahmanda Puranam'.\n \nAnother version regarding the consecration of the Main Idol of the Temple relates to the legendary sage Vilvamangalathu Swamiyar. Swamiyar, who resided near [[Ananthapura Lake Temple|Ananthapuram Temple]] in Kasaragod District, prayed to Lord Vishnu for his ''[[Dar\u015bana|darshan]]'' or \"auspicious sight\". The Lord is believed to have come in the guise of a little boy who was mischievous. The boy defiled the Idol which was kept for Puja. The sage became enraged at this and chased away the boy who disappeared before him. Realizing the boy was no ordinary mortal, the sage wept for forgiveness and asked for another darshan as a sign. He heard a voice say \"If you want to see me come to the Anathavana (the unending forest or ananthakadu). After a long search, when he was walking on the banks of [[Laccadive Sea]], he heard a ''[[pulaya]]'' lady warning her child that she would throw him in Ananthankadu. The moment the Swami heard the word Ananthankadu he was delighted. He proceeded to Ananthankadu based on the directions of the lady of whom he enquired. The Sage reached Ananthankadu searching for the boy. There he saw the boy merging into an Iluppa tree (Indian Butter Tree). The tree fell down and became Anantha Sayana Moorti (Vishnu reclining on the celestial snake [[Ananta (infinite)|Anantha]]). But the edifice that the Lord assumed was of an extraordinarily large size, with His head at Thiruvattar near Thuckalay Tamil Nadu, Body or Udal at Thiruvananthapuram, and lotus-feet at Thrippadapuram near Kulathoor and Technopark (Thrippappur), making him some eight miles in length. The Sage requested the Lord to shrink to a smaller proportion that would be thrice the length of his staff. Immediately the Lord shrank to the form of the Idol that is seen at present in the Temple. But even then many Iluppa trees obstructed a complete vision of the Lord. The Sage saw the Lord in three parts \u2013 thirumukham, thiruvudal and thrippadam. Swami prayed to Padmanabha to be forgiven. The Swami offered Rice Kanji and Uppumanga (salted mango pieces) in a coconut shell to the Perumal which he obtained from the pulaya woman. The spot where the Sage had darsan of the Lord belonged to Koopakkara Potti and Karuva Potti. With the assistance of the reigning King and some Brahmin households a Temple was constructed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spst.in/temple-history/ |title=Temple History}}</ref> The Ananthankadu Nagaraja Temple still exists to the north west of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple. The Samadhi (final resting place) of the Swamiyar exists to the west of the Padmanabha Temple. A Krishna Temple was built over the Samadhi. This Temple, known as Vilvamangalam Sri Krishna Swami Temple, belongs to Thrissur [[Naduvil Madhom]].<ref name=\"Aswathi\" />\n\n===Travancore royal family===\nIn the first half of the 18th century, in line with [[Nair|matrilineal customs]], Anizham Thirunal [[Marthanda Varma]], succeeded his uncle Rama Varma as king at the age of 23. He successfully suppressed the 700-year-old stranglehold of the [[Ettuveetil Pillamar]] (\"Lords of the Eight Houses\") and his cousins following the discovery of conspiracies which the lords were involved in against the royal house of Travancore (There are various legends and disputes about this stories but overall he took control and centralized the rule). The last major renovation of the Padmanabhaswamy temple commenced immediately after Anizham Thirunal's accession to the musnud and the idol was reconsecrated in 906 [[Malayalam calendar|ME]] (1731 CE). On 17 January 1750, Anizham Thirunal surrendered the kingdom of [[Travancore]] to Padmanabha Swamy, the deity at the temple, and pledged that he and his descendants would be vassals or agents of the deity who would serve the kingdom as ''Padmanabha Dasa''.<ref name=\"Temples of Kerala\" /> Since then, the name of every Travancore king was preceded by the title Sree Padmanabha Dasa; the female members of the royal family were called Sree Padmanabha Sevinis. The donation of the king to Padmanabhaswamy was known as Thrippadi-danam. The final wishes of Anizham Thirunal on his passing at the age of 53 clearly delineated the historical relationship between the Maharaja and the temple: \"That no deviation whatsoever should be made in regard to the dedication of the kingdom to Padmanabhaswamy and that all future territorial acquisitions should be made over to the Devaswom.\"\n\n==Temple structure==\n[[File:Thiruvanthapuram Temple Approach.JPG|thumb|200px|The approach road to the Padmanabhaswamy temple]]\n\n===Main shrine===\nIn the ''[[sanctum sanctorum]]'', Padmanabha reclines on the serpent ''[[Ananta (infinite)|Anantha]] '' or ''Adi Sesha''.<ref>{{Citation |last=Jayashanker|first1=S|title=Temples of Kerala|year=1999}}</ref> The serpent has five hoods facing inwards, signifying contemplation.

The Lord of Thiruvambadi is Parthasarathi, the Divine Charioteer of [[Arjuna]]. The granite idol of the Lord of Thiruvambadi was brought from Gujarat by 72 families of Vrishni Vamsa Kshatriyas. As these Vrishnies belong to the lineage of Lord Krishna, they are known as Krishnan vakakkar. The two-armed granite idol, with one hand holding the whip and the other resting on the left thigh holding the conch close to it, is in standing posture. On [[Ekadasi]] days the Lord is dressed and decorated as [[Mohini]]. There are also shrines for [[Rama]] accompanied by [[Sita]], [[Lakshmana]] and [[Hanuman]], Vishwaksena (the Nirmalyadhari of Vishnu and Remover of Obstacles), [[Vyasa]], [[Ganapati]], [[Sasta]], and Kshetrapala (who guards the temple).

The ground floor under the gopuram (main entrance in the eastern side) is known as the 'Nataka Sala' where the famous temple art [[Kathakali]] was staged in the night during the ten-day ''uthsavam'' (festival) conducted twice a year, during the [[Malayalam calendar#Months|Malayalam months]] of Meenam and Thulam.{{fact|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Temple rituals==\n{{Inline citations|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Festivals and rites===\n[[File:Aaratu1.jpg|thumb|Narasimha Swamy and Padmanabha Swamy after coming from Shankumuka Beach during Aarat Festival]]\nThere are many festivals related to this temple. The major festivals are bi-annual. The ''Alpashy'' festival which is in October/November and the ''[[Panguni Uthiram|Panguni]]'' festival which is in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] month Panguni, March/April, lasts for 10 days each. On the ninth day the Maharajah of Travancore, in his capacity as Thrippappoor Mooppan, escorts the deities to the vettakkalam for Pallivetta. Centuries back, the Pallivetta procession was said to pass through Kaithamukku, Kuthiravattom (Kunnumpuram), [[Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram Temple|Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram]] and Putharikkandam. The festivals culminate with the ''Aarat'' (holy bath) procession to the [[Shankumugham Beach]]. The word ''Aarat'' refers to the purificatory immersion of the deities of the temple in sea. This event takes place in the evening. The Maharajah of Travancore escorts the ''Aarat'' procession on foot. The festival idols \"Utsava Vigrahas\" of Padmanabhaswamy, Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami are given a ritual bath in the sea, after the prescribed [[puja (Hinduism)|puja]]s. After this ceremony, the idols are taken back to the temple in a procession that is lit by traditional torches, marking the conclusion of the festival.<ref name=\"Aswathi\" />\n\nA major annual festival related to Padmanabha temple is the ''[[Navaratri]]'' festival. The idols of [[Saraswati]] Amman, Mun Uditha Nangai ([[Parasakti]] who appeared before Saraswati, [[Lakshmi]] and Parvati to help them identify their husbands who had been transformed into infants by the power of chastity of [[Anasuya]]) and Kumara Swami ([[Murugan]]) are brought to the ''Kuthira malika'' palace in front of Padmanabha temple as a procession. This festival lasts for 9 days. The famous Swathi music festival is held every year during this festival.\n\n[[File:Aaratu3.jpg|thumb|upright|Big idol of Pandavas displayed during Panguni festival]]\n\nThe biggest festival in this temple is ''laksha deepam'', which means hundred thousand (or one [[lakh]]) lamps. This festival is unique and commences once in 6 years. Prior to this festival, chanting of prayers and recitation of three [[vedas]] is done for 56 days (Murajapam). On the last day, hundred thousand oil lamps are lit in and around the temple premises. The next ''laksha deepam'' is slated in January 2020.\n\n===Priests===\nTemples where 'Swamiyar Pushpanjali' is conducted are claimants to extra sanctity. Sannyasins from [[Naduvil Madhom]] and Munchira Madhom do pushpanjali (flower worship) daily to Padmanabha, Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami. Tharananallur Nambuthiripads of Iranjalakkuda are the Tantris of the Temple. The Nambies, altogether four in number, are the Chief Priests of the Temple. Two Nambies - Periya Nambi and Panchagavyathu Nambi - are allotted to Padmanabha and one Nambi each to Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami. The Nambies hail from either side of the Chandragiri River.<ref name=\"Aswathi\" />\n\n<br />\n\n=== Temple entry ===\nIn line with the [[Temple Entry Proclamation]], only those who profess the Hindu faith are permitted entry to the temple and devotees have to strictly follow the dress code.<ref>Pippa De Bruyn, Keith Bain, David Allardice ''Frommer's India'' 2010 Page 281 \"Padmanabhaswamy Temple - This Tamil style Vishnu temple, said to be the largest in Kerala, may be off-limits to non-Hindus, but the \"temple guides\" manage to target foreigners with great ease, leading them to the obligatory spots from. \"</ref>\n\n==Temple management==\n{{Inline citations|date=October 2019}}\nThe Padmanabhaswamy Temple and its property were controlled by the [[Ettara Yogam]] (King and Council of Eight) with the assistance of [[Ettuveetil Pillamar]] (\"Lords of the Eight Houses\"). The Ettara Yogam consists of Pushpanjali Swamiyar, six member Thiruvananthapurathu Sabha, Sabhanjithan (Secretary) and Arachan (Maharaja of Travancore). Thiruvananthapurathu Sabha was primarily responsible for the administration of the Temple. Koopakkara Potti, Vanchiyoor Athiyara Potti, Kollur Athiyara Potti, Muttavila Potti, Karuva Potti and Neythasseri Potti are the members of the Sabha. The Pushpanjali Swamiyar presides over the meetings of the Sabha. Sreekaryathu Potti is the Sabhanjithan of the Sabha.<ref>Sri Padmanabha Swamy Kshethram Charithra Rekhakalilude by S. Uma Maheswari</ref> Any decision taken by the Sabha can be implemented only if the Maharaja of Travancore approves of it.<ref>Charithram Kuricha Sree Padmanabha Swamy Kshethram by Dr MG Sasibhooshan and Dr RP Raja</ref> It is believed that eight members of Ettara Yogam (seven Potties and the Maharaja of Travancore) received their rights from Lord Parashurama Himself.\n\nIn the past, only the Swamiyars of the [[Naduvil Madhom]] were appointed as Pushpanjali Swamiyars by the [[Maharaja of Travancore]]. Anizham Thirunal [[Marthanda Varma]] curtailed the authority of Ettara Yogam and liquidated the powerful Ettuveetil Pillamar. Ettara Yogam became an advisory and assenting body thereafter. Besides Naduvil Madhom, Munchira Madhom got the right to appoint Pushpanjali Swamiyars during his reign. In the recent past, [[Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma]] gave Pushpanjali rights to the Swamiyars of Thrikkaikattu Madhom and Thekke Madhom as well. Though the Maharaja is the appointing authority of the Pushpanjali Swamiyar, the former must do a Vechu Namaskaram when he sees the Swamiyar. With the passing away of Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma in December 2013, his nephew [[Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma]] became the titular Maharaja of Travancore in January 2014. Like his predecessors, Moolam Thirunal also got concurrence from the Ettara Yogam before assuming the title 'Maharaja'. In the presence of the Maharaja designate, the Yogathil Pottimar and the Tantri, the Pushpanjali Swamiyar Maravanchery Thekkedathu Neelakanta Bharatikal signed on the Neettu (Order) of the Ettara Yogam accepting Moolam Thirunal as ''Chirava Mootha Thiruvadi'' (Maharaja of Travancore) and ''Thrippappoor Mootha Thiruvadi'' (Protector of the Temple). This ceremony took place at Kulasekhara Mandapam in Padmanabha Swamy Temple. [[Revathi Thirunal Balagopal Varma]], grandson of Maharani Regent Pooradom Thirunal [[Sethu Lakshmi Bayi]], is the titular Elayaraja of Travancore.\n\n==Extant temple records==\n{{Inline citations|date=October 2019}}\nA pertinent event in the long history of the temple was the construction of a \"granta-pura\" (record-room) within the temple compound itself around 1425 A.D. by the then Venad King Veera Iravi Iravi Varma, to store the \"Mathilakam\" (within-the-walls) records, as the then existing temple records were known.<ref name=\"frontline.in\">{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2815/stories/20110729281512800.htm|title=Key to the past|publisher=}}</ref> A major portion of those records (over 3000 'Cadjan' leaf-records) from the Mathikalam had been donated later to the Archives Department in 1867 at the time of the formation of the latter. Each of these Cadjan leaf-records, which have been compiled over thousands of years, contains 10,000 documentations according to [[R._Nagaswamy]], noted archeologist and historian, totaling over 30 crores of records. Despite their cultural value, only a minuscule portion of these grantas (bundles) of cadjan leaf records, written mostly in ancient scripts of proto-[[Tamil script|Tamil]] and archaic-Malayalam, have been deciphered. The translations of this section of manuscripts by some scholars serve as a rare but very inadequate primary source material on the temple and its rich traditions.\n\nThe rest of these Mathilakam documents - segregated under 70 \"heads\" - is still lying idle with the Archives Department. According to Aswathi Thirunal Gouri Lakshmi Bayi, a member of the Travancore Royal Family and author of a book on the temple, from a very early period in recorded history the temple had employed two kinds of 'record writers'. One group was to record the proceedings and transactions of the Ettarayogam, a council of temple administrators, that included the then king. The other was to write and preserve the records of the day-to-day functioning of the temple, maintain correct accounts of the temple-treasury, and of temple-revenue-collections and temple-expenditure, and as well as write down all the other records, connected with the functioning of the temple.\n\n==Temple assets==\n{{Main article|Padmanabhaswamy Temple treasure}}\n{{wikinews|Hidden treasure worth billions of dollars discovered in Indian temple}}\nThe temple and its assets belong to Lord Padmanabhaswamy, and were for a long time controlled by a trust, headed by the [[Travancore royal family|Travancore Royal family]].

While vault B has been unopened over centuries, A was possibly opened in the 1930s, and vaults C to F have been opened from time to time over recent years. The two priests of the temple, the 'Periya Nambi' and the 'Thekkedathu Nambi', are the custodians of the four vaults, C to F, which are opened periodically. The Supreme Court had directed that \"the existing practices, procedures, and rituals\" of the temple be followed while opening vaults C to F and using the articles inside, while Vaults A and B would be opened only for the purpose of making an inventory of the articles and then closed. The review of the temple's underground vaults was undertaken by a seven-member panel appointed by the [[Supreme Court of India]] to generate an inventory, leading to the enumeration of a vast collection of articles that are traditionally kept under lock and key. A detailed inventory of the temple assets, consisting of gold, jewels, and other valuables is yet to be made.\n\nWhile vault B remains unopened, vaults A, C, D, E and F were opened along with some of their antechambers.

The Malabar region (as a part of the \"Tamilakam\" region of recorded history) had several centers of trade and commerce since the Sumerian Period ranging from Vizhinjam in the South to Mangalore in the North. Also, at times like the invasion by Mysore in the late 1700s, the other related royal families (of the Travancore Royal Family) in Kerala and the Far South, like the Kolathiris, took refuge in Thiruvananthapuram and stored their temple-wealth for safekeeping in the Padmanabhaswamy Temple.<ref name=\"thehindu.com\"/><ref name=\"rediff.com\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"frontline.in\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"frontline.in1\"/><ref name=\"commodityonline.com\"/><ref>http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/why-sree-padmanabhaswamy-temple-s-mysterious-vault-b-should-be-opened-expert-explains-65521</ref> Also, much of the treasures housed in the much larger and as-yet-unopened vaults, as well as in the much smaller cellars that have been opened, date back to long before the institution of the so-called Travancore Kingdom, e.g. the {{cvt|800|kg}} hoard of gold coins from 200 B.C that was mentioned by [[Vinod Rai]]. Noted archaeologist and historian [[R. Nagaswamy]] has also stated that several records exist in Kerala, of offerings made to the Deity, from several parts of Kerala.<ref name=\"thehindu.com\"/> Lastly, it has to be remembered that in the Travancore Kingdom, a distinction was always made between the Government (State) Treasury (Karuvelam), the Royal Family Treasury (Chellam), and the Temple Treasury (Thiruvara Bhandaram or Sri Bhandaram). During the reign of Maharani [[Gowri Lakshmi Bayi]], hundreds of temples that were mismanaged in the Kerala region, were brought under the Government. The excess ornaments in these temples were also transferred to the Vaults of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple. Instead the funds of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple were utilised for the daily upkeep of these temples.\n\nOn 4 July 2011 the seven-member expert team tasked with taking stock of the temple assets decided to postpone opening of Chamber 'B'. This chamber is sealed with an iron door with the image of a cobra on it and it has not been opened, due to the belief opening it would result in much misfortune.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hayes|first=S|title=The Forgotten and Cursed Billion Treasure Trove Discovered Beneath Indian Temple|url=http://newsflavor.com/world/asia/the-forgotten-and-cursed-22-billion-treasure-trove-discovered-beneath-indian-temple/|accessdate=18 July 2011|newspaper=NewsFlavor|date=10 July 2011}}</ref> The royal family said that many legends were attached to the temple and that chamber B has a model of a snake on the main door and opening it could be a bad omen.<ref>{{cite news|title=Legend halts Kerala temple stocktaking|url=http://www.asianage.com/india/legend-halts-kerala-temple-stocktaking-150|accessdate=18 July 2011|newspaper=[[The Asian Age]]|date=4 July 2011}}</ref> The seven-member team will consult with some more experts on 8 July 2011 and then they may take the final decision on opening of chamber 'B'.<ref name=\"Sree Padmanabha Swamy temple: Lord's riches worth more than Rs 1 lakh cr\">{{cite news|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-07-05/news/29739016_1_market-value-Sree-padmanabha-swamy-treasure-trove|title=Sree Padmanabha Swamy temple: Lord's riches worth more than Rs 1 lakh cr|author=TNN|date=5 July 2011|newspaper=The Economic Times|accessdate=5 July 2011|location=New Delhi}}</ref> An Ashtamangala Devaprasnam conducted in the Temple to discern the will of the Lord revealed that any attempts to open Chamber 'B' would cause Divine displeasure and that the holy articles in the other chambers were defiled in the inventorying process.<ref name=\"Mathrubhumi Aug 12, 2011\"/> The original petitioner whose court action led to the inventory taking, T.P.

This was possibly an antechamber of any of the Vaults A or C or D or E or F that may not have been opened yet. This was necessitated due to the severe economic depression that India was going through as was the entire world. The Palace and State Treasuries had run almost dry. The small group of people including the King and the priests found a granary-sized structure almost full with mostly gold and some silver coins and jewels. Surmounted on top of it were hundreds of pure gold pots. There were four coffers filled with gold coins as well. Also found was a larger chest fixed to the ground with six sections in it. They were full of gold jewelry encrusted with diamonds, rubies, sapphires and emeralds. Besides these, were four more chests of old coins (not of gold), and they were carried back to the Palace and State Treasuries for counting from.<ref name=\"a.srivathsan\"/>\n\n===Vault (Nilavara) B (\"The Forbidden Zone\")===\nThe Bhagavata Purana says that Lord [[Balarama]] visited  Phalgunam (more commonly known as Thiruvananthapuram), took bath in Panchapsaras (Padmateertham) and made a gift of ten thousand cows to holy men.<ref>\"Srimad Bhagavata\" (Page 381 of Volume Three). Translated by Swami Tapasyananda. Published by Sri Ramakrishna Math, Chennai</ref> Though the sannidhyam of Lord Padmanabha has always been present in the holy land of Thiruvananthapuram making it a pilgrim spot even during the time of Balarama, the present-day Temple for the Lord came up later. The southwest part of the Chuttambalam was constructed at the holy spot where Lord Balarama is believed to have donated cows to holy men. This portion came to be known as Mahabharatakonam and covered the ground underneath which both Kallara B and Kallara A were situated.<ref>Letter of His Holiness the Pushpanjali Swamiyar to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan</ref>\n\nAccording to a popular legend, many Devas and Sages devoted to Lord Balarama visited Him on the banks of Padmateertham. They requested Him that they may be permitted to reside there worshipping the Lord. Balarama granted them their wish. It is believed that these Devas and Sages reside in Kallara B worshipping the Lord.

Lord Ugra [[Narasimha]] of Thekkedom is said to be the Protector of Kallara B. There is a serpent's image on Kallara B indicating danger to anyone who opens it. A four-day [[Ashtamangala prasnam|Ashtamangala Devaprasnam]] conducted in August 2011 declared Kallara B as \"forbidden zone\".<ref name=\"The Hindu dated July 7, 2011\">The Hindu dated July 7, 2011</ref>\n\nIn 2011, the antechamber to Kallara B was opened by the Observers appointed by the Supreme Court of India.<ref>The Hindu dated June 29, 2011</ref> But the Observers could not open Kallara B. However, Gopal Subramanium in his report submitted to the Supreme Court in April 2014, recommended its opening after conducting another Devaprasnam. The two Pushpanjali Swamiyars are the highest spiritual dignitaries of Padmanabha Swamy Temple. The Pushpanjali Swamiyar of Naduvil Madhom sent letters to the Chairperson of the Administrative Committee and the Executive Officer on February 8, 2016 expressing his strong opposition to the opening of Kallara B.<ref>Mathrubhumi, Thiruvananthapuram Edition dated February 26, 2016</ref> The Pushpanjali Swamiyar of Munchira Madhom led a Ratha Yathra from Kasaragod to Thiruvananthapuram in May 2018 campaigning against opening the sacred Kallara. [[Azhvanchery Thamprakkal]], the supreme spiritual leader of Kerala Brahmins, while addressing a meeting held in connection with the Ratha Yathra also demanded that faith should not be trampled upon by opening Kallara B.<ref>Mathrubhumi and Malayala Manorama, Thiruvananthapuram Edition dated May 14, 2018</ref>\n\n[[Mukilan's invasion of Venad|Mukilan]], a Muslim marauder, invaded vast chunks of Venad in 1680 AD.<ref>Menon, P Shungoonny.

Mukilan had plans to plunder the vaults of Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple and destroy it. But he was dissuaded from doing so by local Pathans loyal to the Royals of Venad.   Padmanabhan Thampi, arch rival of Anizhom Thirunal Marthanda Varma, marched to Thiruvananthapuram with his forces and tried to loot the vaults of the Temple. Thampi stayed at Sri Varaham and sent his mercenaries to Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple. It is said that divine serpents materialised in hundreds and scared away Thampi's men. Emboldened by this heavenly intervention, [[Pallichal Pillai]] and local people opposed Padmanabhan Thampi and ensured that the mercenaries did not proceed with the misadventure.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that Kallara B was opened after the 1880s. An article by Emily Gilchrist,  a visiting Englishwoman in the 1933, recalls in her book 'Travancore: A Guide Book for the Visitor' (Oxford University Press, 1933) about an unsuccessful attempt to open one Kallara in 1908: \"About 25 years ago, when the State needed additional money, it was thought expedient to open these chests and use the wealth they contained.\" \"A group of people\" got together and attempted to enter the vaults with torches.

Despite opposition from the Royal Family and the Tantries of the Temple, he pulled out a stone Yantra from the nearby Marthandan Madhom Palace and did pooja on it for several days. The Tantries explained that the Yantram had no connection with the Padmanabhaswami Temple and that it was for the protection of the Palace. But the Amicus Curiae insisted on having it installed in the Sanctum Sanctorum of the Temple. Due to severe opposition from the Tantries the Yantram remains where it was. Every morning, Lord Padmanabha is to be awakened only by blowing the conch shell and chanting the Sripada Sooktham. But the Amicus Curiae introduced the daily rendering of Venkatesa Suprabhatam to awaken the Lord. The Supreme Court requested the Tantri to take the final decision on whether the Suprabhatam could be sung. Following that, the Senior Tantri Nedumpilli Tharananalloor Parameswaran Namboothiripad directed the Temple authorities to stop the chanting of Suprabhatam forthwith, as it was causing 'Anya Mantra Yajana Dosham' (affliction due to worshipping the Deity with incompatible mantras) to the Presiding Deity and the Temple. As atonement for this dosham, the Tantri wants Vedic scholars to chant 12 'muras' each of Rig Veda and Yajur Veda. In his first report to the Supreme Court, the Amicus Curiae directed the Tantries to examine whether a [[Sri Yantra]] can be installed in the Sanctum Sanctorum, in front of the utsava moorthi.<ref>Report of the Amicus Curiae, Pg 63</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Padmanabhaswamy Temple treasure]]\n* [[Thirumal in Thiruvananthapuram]]\n* [[Temples of Kerala]]\n* [[Methan mani]], clock tower adjoining the temple\n* {{Portal-inline|India}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Padmanabhaswamy Temple}}\n* [http://spst.in/ Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple] (Official Website)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120416181925/http://www.sree-padmanabhaswamy.com/ Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple] (Information About Sree Padmanabhaswamy)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110709184850/http://www.247onlinenews.com/2011/07/padmanabhaswamy-temple-treasures-belong-to-royal-family-sankaracharya/ Padmanabhaswamy Temple treasures belong to royal family: Sankaracharya]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131227024931/http://mapkerala.in/page/padmanabhaswamy_temple Padmanabhaswamy temple tour information]\n* [https://templesblog.com/sree-padmanabhaswamy-temple-thiruvananthapuram Padmanabhaswamy temple tour information]\n{{Vishnu temples}}\n{{Hindu temples in Kerala}}\n{{Thiruvananthapuram}}\n{{Hinduism (compact)}}\n\n[[Category:Vishnu temples]]\n[[Category:Divya Desams]]\n[[Category:Hindu pilgrimage sites in India]]\n[[Category:Hindu temples in Thiruvananthapuram]]\n[[Category:Monuments of National Importance in Kerala]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Thiruvananthapuram]]\n[[Category:Vaishnavism]]\n[[Category:Travancore royal family]]\n[[Category:Tamilakam]]\n", "name_user": "IamRohitKamal", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padmanabhaswamy_Temple"}

The project was developed from early United States Air Force (USAF) and [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) concepts of crewed [[space station]]s to be used for [[reconnaissance]] purposes.  MOL evolved into a single-use laboratory, with which crews would be launched on 40-day missions and return to Earth using a '''Gemini B''' spacecraft, derived from NASA's [[Gemini spacecraft]].\n\nThe MOL program was announced to the public on 10 December 1963 as an inhabited platform to prove the utility of putting people in space for military missions. Astronauts selected for the program were later told of the reconnaissance mission for the program. The prime contractor for the spacecraft was [[McDonnell Aircraft]]; the laboratory was built by the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]]. The Gemini B was externally similar to NASA's Gemini spacecraft, although it underwent several modifications, including the addition of a circular hatch through the heat shield, which allowed passage between the spacecraft and the laboratory. [[Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 6]] was developed to permit launches into [[polar orbit]].\n\nMOL competed with the [[Vietnam War]] for funds, and was beset by budget cuts that caused the date of the first operational flight to be repeatedly postponed. A single [[OPS 0855|uncrewed test flight]] was launched on 3 November 1966. The program was canceled in June 1969, after it was demonstrated that automated [[reconnaissance satellite]]s were more cost-effective.\n\n== Background ==\nAt the height of the [[Cold War]] in the mid-1950s, the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) was particularly interested in reconnaissance from space, as there was intense interest in the [[Soviet Union]]'s military and industrial capabilities. In July 1957\u2014before anyone had flown in space\u2014the USAF [[Wright Air Development Center]] had published a paper the employment of space vehicles that considered the development of a space station equipped with telescopes and other observation devices.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=2}} The USAF already started a satellite program in 1956 called WS-117L. It had three components: [[Samos (satellite)|SAMOS]], a spy satellite; [[Corona (satellite)|Discoverer]], an experimental program to develop the technology; and [[Missile Defense Alarm System|MIDAS]], an early warning system.{{sfn|Divine|1993|p=11}}\n\n[[File:Bernard Adolph Schriever.jpg|thumb|right|General [[Bernard Adolph Schriever]] ]]\nThe launch of [[Sputnik 1]], the first [[satellite]], by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957, came as a profound shock to the American public, which had complacently assumed American technical superiority, and sparked a search for initiatives to counter its psychological impact.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=28\u201329, 37}}{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=1}} The [[Sputnik crisis]] had a silver lining: no government protested Sputnik's overflying their territory, thereby tacitly acknowledging the legality of satellites. While there was a big difference between the innocuous Sputnik and a spy satellite, it made it all that much harder for the Soviets to object to one.{{sfn|Divine|1993|pp=11\u201312}} Starting in 1956, the United States had conducted covert [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy plane overflights of the Soviet Union. Twenty-four U-2 missions produced images of about 15 percent of the country with a maximum resolution of {{convert|2|ft}} before the [[1960 U-2 incident|downing of a U-2 in 1960]] abruptly ended the program.{{sfn|David|2017|p=768}} This left a gap in American espionage capabilities that it was hoped that spy satellites would be able to fill.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=2\u20133}}  In February 1958, in the wake of Sputnik, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] ordered the USAF to proceed as quickly as possible with Discover (also known as Corona) as a joint [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA)-USAF interim project.{{sfn|Wheeldon|1998|p=33}}{{sfn|Day|1998|p=49}}\n\nOn 18 August 1958, Eisenhower decided to give responsibility for most forms of human space flight to the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA). [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald A. Quarles]] transferred $53.8 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|53,800,000|1958|r=2}} }} in {{Inflation/year|US}}) that that had been set aside for USAF space projects, including Man in Space Soonest to NASA.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=101\u2013102}} This left the USAF with a small number of programs with a direct military impact.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=4}} One was a delta-wing, rocket-propelled glider that came to be called the [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar]].{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=71}} The USAF remained interested in space, and March 1959, the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[Thomas D. White]] asked the USAF Director of Development Planning to prepare a long-range plan for a USAF space program. One project identified in the resulting document was a \"manned orbital laboratory\".{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=5}}\n\nThe USAF [[Air Research and Development Command]] (ARDC) issued a request to the [[Aeronautical Systems Division]] (ASD) at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] on 1 September 1959 for a formal study to be conducted of a military test space station (MTSS). The ASD asked components of the ARDC for suggestions as to what sort of experiments would be suitable for an MTSS, and 125 proposals were received. Twelve contractors made proposals. A [[request for proposal]] (RFP) was then issued on 19 February 1960, and twelve firms responded. On 15 August, [[General Electric]], [[Lockheed Aircraft]], [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin]], [[McDonnell Aircraft]], and [[General Dynamics]] were awarded $574,999 (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|574,999|1961}} }} in {{Inflation/year|US}}) for a study of the MTSS.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=5}} Their preliminary reports were submitted in January 1961, and final reports were received by July. With these in hand, on 16 August 1961 the USAF submitted a request for $5 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|5,000,000|1961|r=2}} }} in {{Inflation/year|US}}) in funding for space station studies in [[fiscal year]] 1963, but no funding was forthcoming.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=6\u20138}}\n\n[[File:MOL patch from NRO.jpg|thumb|left|MOL patch]]\nIn its 26 April 1961 project plan, Dyna-Soar was to be launched into space on a suborbital ballistic trajectory by a [[Titan I]] booster, with its first piloted suborbital flight in April 1965, followed by its first piloted orbital flight in April 1966,{{sfn|Houchin|1995|p=273}} but concerns were raised as to whether over whether permission to land in Brazil would be forthcoming.{{sfn|Houchin|1995|p=279}}  In a 22 February memorandum to the  [[Secretary of the Air Force]], [[Eugene Zuckert]], McNamara decided to fast track Dyna-Soar and save money by skipping the suborbital testing phase. Dyna-Soar would be launched into orbit by a [[Titan III]] booster.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=6\u20138}}{{sfn|Erickson|2005|p=353}}{{sfn|Houchin|1995|p=311}}\n\nThe same 22 February memorandum tacit approval for the development of a space station. With this in hand, the USAF staff and the [[Air Force Systems Command]] (AFSC) began planning for a space station, which was now known as a [[Manned Orbital Development System|military orbital development system]] (MODS). By the end of May, a proposed system package plan (PSPP) had been drawn up for MODS, which was designated Program 287. MODS consisted of a space station, a modified NASA [[Gemini spacecraft]] that became known as [[Blue Gemini]], and a Titan III launch vehicle. The space station was expected to provide a [[shirt-sleeve environment]] for a crew of four for up to 30 days.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=6\u20138}} On 25 August 1962, Zuckert informed General [[Bernard Adolph Schriever]], the commander of the AFSC, that he was to proceed with studies of the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) as the director of the program.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=10}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/2.pdf |title=Memorandum for Director, Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) Program \u2013 Subject: Authorization To Proceed With MOL Program |first=Eugene |last=Zuckert |author-link=Eugene Zuckert |publisher=Department of Defence |date=25 August 1962 |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 November 1962, Zuckert submitted his proposals to McNamara. For fiscal year 1964, he requested $75 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|75,000,000|1962|r=2}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}) in funding for MODS and $102 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|102,000,000|1961|r=2}} }} in {{Inflation/year|US}})  for Blue Gemini.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=10}} This involved some negotiation with NASA, but McNamara and [[NASA Administrator]] reached an agreement on cooperation on Project Gemini on 21 January 1963.{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|2010|pp=120\u2013122}} On 18 January 1963, McNamara called for a review of Dyna-Soar, specifically whether it had a military capability that could not be met by Gemini. In his 14 November response, the [[Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering|Director of Defense Research and Engineering]] (DDR&E), [[Harold Brown (Secretary of Defense)|Harold Brown]], examined various options for a space station. He preferred a four-man station that would be launched separately and crewed by astronauts arriving in Gemini spacecraft. Crews would rotate every 30 days, with resupply arriving every 120 days.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=25\u201327}}{{sfn|Erickson|2005|pp=370\u2013371}} On 10 December 1963, McNamara issued a press release that officially announced the cancellation of Dyna-Soar and the initiation the MOL program.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/6.pdf |title=Air Force to Develop Manned Orbiting Laboratory |publisher=Department of Defence |date=10 December 1963 |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nSoon after coming to office, the [[Kennedy administration]] tightened security regarding spy satellites in response to Soviet sensitivities.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=37\u201338}} No administration official could even admit they existed until President [[Jimmy Carter]] did so in 1978.{{sfn|Erickson|2005|pp=378\u2013379}} MOL therefore became a semi-secret project, with a public face but a covert reconnaissance mission, similar to that of the Discoverer/Corona spy satellite program.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=8}}\n\n==Planning==\n[[File:Major General Joseph S. Bleymaier Jr.jpg|thumb|right|Major General Joseph S. Bleymaier Jr.]]\nOn 16 December 1963, USAF Headquarters ordered Schriever to submit a development plan for the MOL.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=36}} About $6 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|6,000,000|1964|r=2}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}) was spent on preliminary studies, most of which were completed by September 1964. McDonnell prepared a study of the Gemini B spacecraft, [[Martin Marietta]] of the Titan III booster,{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=4\u20135}} and [[Eastman Kodak]] of camera optics.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=37\u201338}}  Other studies examined key MOL subsystems such as environmental control, electrical power, navigation, attitude control stabilization, guidance, communications, and radar.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=43\u201344}} The [[United States Under Secretary of the Air Force]] and the Director of the [[National Reconnaissance Office]] (NRO), [[Brockway McMillan]], asked the NRO Program A Director (responsible for the Air Force aspects of NRO activities), [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Robert Evans Greer]], to look into its potential reconnaissance capabilities.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=4\u20135}} In all, $3,237,716 (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|3,237,716|1964}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}) was expended on these studies. The most expensive was of the Gemini B spacecraft, which cost $1,189,500 (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|1,189,500|1964}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}), followed by the Titan III interface, which cost $910,000 (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|910,000|1964}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}).{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=43\u201344}}  \n\nWith these studies in hand, the USAF issued an RFP to twenty firms in January 1965. At the end of February, [[Boeing]], [[Douglas Aircraft|Douglas]], General Electric and [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] were selected to carry out design studies.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=4\u20135}} Covert NRO activities to be carried out by MOL were classified [[classified information#Secret|secret]] and given the code name \"Dorian\".{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=40}} In February 1969 the MOL was given a [[Key Hole]] designation as KH-10 Dorian.<ref>{{cite web |title= Designation of MOL as the KH-10 Photographic Reconnaissance Satellite System |date=14 February 1968 |first=James T. |last=Stewart |author-link=James T.

An MOL Experiments Working Group was created under Colonel William Brady. Some 400 experiments proposed by various agencies were examined. These were consolidated and reduced to 59, and twelve primary and eighteen secondary ones were selected. A 499-page report on the experiments was issued on 1 April 1964.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=40\u201341}}\n\nThe USAF recommended that the MOL use the Gemini B spacecraft with the Titan III booster. A program of six flights (one uncrewed and five crewed) was proposed, with the first flight taking place in 1966. The program was costed at $1.653 billion (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|1,653,000,000|1964|r=2}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}). The [[Science Advisor to the President]], [[Donald Hornig]], reviewed the USAF's submission. He noted that for the sophisticated reconnaissance missions proposed, a human-operated system was far superior to an automated one, but speculated that with sufficient effort, thr gap between the two could be reduced. He also noted that while the notion of satellites passing overhead was accepted, a crewed space station might be a different matter,{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=71\u201379}} but the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[Dean Rusk]], thought that this could be managed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Information and Publicity Controls |date=16 August 1965 |publisher=National Reconnaissance Office |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/125.pdf |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> There remained the question of whether the improved performance compared to the automated [[KH-8 Gambit 3]] satellite then under development justified the cost. The [[Director of Central Intelligence]], [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[William Raborn]] agreed that it might. McNamara took the proposal to President [[Lyndon Johnson]] on 24 August 1965, who approved it, and issued an official announcement at a press conference the following day.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=71\u201379}}<ref>{{cite press release |title=President Johnson's Statement on MOL |date=25 August 1965 |publisher=National Reconnaissance Office |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/129.pdf |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[File:MOL foot restraints.jpg|thumb|left|MOL training]]\n\nIn January 1965, Schriever had appointed [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Harry L.

Under this agreement, the Deputy Director MOL would forward black cost estimates to the NRO Controller, who had the authority to obligate NRO funds. This was followed by a corresponding MOL White Financial Procedures Agreement, which was approved by Flax in December and signed by [[Leonard Marks Jr.]], the [[Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Financial Management & Comptroller)]]. This provided for a more regular channel, with funds going through the AFSC to its Space Systems Division (SSD) and thence to the MOL SPO.  Thus far no definition contracts had been let, except for the Titan III booster. On 30 September, Brown released $12 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|12,000,000|1964|r=2}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}) in fiscal year 1965 funds and $50 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|50,000,000|1964|r=2}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}})  in fiscal year 1966 funds for the MOL definition phase activities.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=85\u201388}}\n\n[[File:MOL mockup.jpg|thumb|right|MOL mockups were used for training and refining the MOL design ]]\nThe President had announced two contractors: Douglas and General Electric.

The laboratory module was divided into two sections, but there was no division between the two, and the crew could move freely between them.<ref name=\"MOL LM\" />\n\nThey were both octagonal in shape, with eight bays: Bays 1 and 8 contained storage compartments; Bay 2, the environmental control system; Bay 3, the hygiene/waste compartment; Bay 4, the biochemical test console and work station; Bays 5 and 6, the airlock; and Bay 7, a [[glovebox]] for handling liquids handling; below that a secondary food console. In the \"lower\" (as it would have been on the launch pad), Bay 1 contained a motion chair that measured the mass of the crew; Bay 2, two performance test panels; Bay 3, the environmental control system controls; Bay 4, a physiology test console; Bay, an exercise device; Bay 6, two emergency oxygen masks; Bay 7, a view port and instrument panel; and Bay 8, the main spacecraft control station.<ref name=\"MOL LM\">{{cite web |title=MOL LM |website=Astronautix.com |url=http://www.astronautix.com/m/mollm.html |access-date=23 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nFrom its regular {{convert|80|nmi|km|adj=on}} ortbit, the main Dorian camera had a circular field of view {{convert|9000|ft|m}} across.

This was much smaller than many of targets that the NRO was interested in, like air bases, shipyards and missile ranges, so the astronauts had only limited time to respond as the MOL passed overherad. The astronauts would search for targets using the tracking and acquisition telescopes, which had a circular view of the landscape about {{convert|6.5|nmi|km}} across, with a resolution of about {{convert|30|ft}}. The main camera would then be brought to bear, providing a very high resolution image.

Nonetheless, Tyuratam was the sort of target that MOL was intended for. Of 159 [[KH-7 Gambit]] photographs of the area, only 9 percent showed missiles on the launch pads, and of 77 photographs of missile silos, only 21 percent were with the doors open. The analysts identified 60 MOL targets in the complex. Only two or three could be photographed on each pass, but the astronauts could select the most interesting ones on the spur of the moment, and photograph them with greater resolution than Gambit. It was hoped that valuable technical information would thereby be obtained. The major limitation was the amount of film that could be carried on each mission, since all of it had to be returned in the small Gemini B spacecraft.<ref name=\"The Measure of a Man (Part 2)\" />\n\n===Specifications===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*Crew: 2\n*Maximum duration: 40 days\n*Orbit: Polar\n*Length: {{convert|21.92|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n*Diameter: {{convert|3.05|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n*Habitable volume: {{convert|11.3|m3|cuft|abbr=on}}\n*Gross mass: {{convert|14476|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n*Payload: {{convert|2700|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n*Power: [[fuel cell]]s or [[solar cell]]s\n*Reaction control system: [[dinitrogen tetroxide|{{chem2|N2O4}}]]/[[Monomethylhydrazine|MMH]]\n*Reference:<ref name=-\"M-MOL\">{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/m/mol.html |title=MOL |website=Astronautix.com |access-date=5 April 2020}}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"220px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:MOL 01.jpg|MOL main features\nFile:Dorian 9.jpg|Gemini B layout\nFile:Dorian 21.jpg|Integral launch dual compartment laboratory\nFile:Dorian_25.jpg|MOL variations\n</gallery>\n\n==Spacecraft==\nThe Gemini capsule was redesigned for the MOL and named Gemini B. It would be launched together with the MOL modules. Once in orbit, the crew would power down the capsule and activate and enter the laboratory module. After about one month of space station operations, the crew would return to the Gemini B capsule, power it up, separate from the station, and perform [[atmospheric entry|reentry]]. Gemini B had an autonomy of about 14 hours once detached from MOL.<ref name=\"Gunter\" /><ref name=\"Gemini B RM\" /><ref name=\"Gemini B\" />\n\nExternally Gemini B was similar to Gemini, but there were many differences. The most noticeable was that it featured a rear hatch for the crew to enter MOL. Notches were cut into the ejection seat headrests to allow access to hatch. The seats were therefore a mirror image of each other instead of being the same. Gemini B also had a Larger diameter heat shield to handle higher energy reentry from polar orbit. The number of reentry control system thrusters was increased from four to six.  There was no [[orbit attitude and maneuvering system]] (OAMS), because capsule orientation for reentry was handled by the forward reentry control system thrusters, and the laboratory module had its own reaction control system for orientation.<ref name=\"Gunter\" /><ref name=\"Gemini B RM\" /><ref name=\"Gemini B\" />\n\nThe Gemini B systems were designed for long term orbital storage (40 days) but equipment for long duration flights was removed since Gemini B capsule itself was only to be used for launch and reentry. It had a different cockpit layout and instruments. As a result of the [[Apollo 1]] fire, the MOL was switched to use a [[Heliox|helium-oxygen]] atmosphere instead of pure oxygen one. At takeoff, the astronauts would breathe pure oxygen in their spacesuits while the cabin was presurized with helium. It would then be brought up to a helium-oxygen mix.<ref name=\"Gunter\">{{cite web |title=Gemini-B |url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/gemini-b.htm  |publisher=Gunter's Space Page. |access-date= 5 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Gemini B RM\">{{cite web |title=Gemini B RM |website=Astronautix.com |url=http://www.astronautix.com/g/geminibrm.html |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Gemini B\">{{cite web |url=http://www.space1.com/pdf/news1096.pdf |issue=1 |date=September 1996 |title=Gemini B NASA-Gemini's Air Force Twin |access-date=5 April 2020 |publisher=Historic Space Systems}}</ref>\n\n===Reentry module specifications===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*Crew: 2\n*Maximum duration: 40 days\n*Length: {{convert|3.35|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n*Diameter: {{convert|2.32|m|ftin|abbr=on}}\n*Cabin volume: {{convert|2.55|m3|cuft|abbr=on}}\n*Gross mass: {{convert|1983|kg|abbr=on}}\n*RCS thrusters: {{cvt|16|\u00d7|98|N}}\n*RCS impulse: {{convert|283|isp}}\n*Electric system: {{cvt|4|kWh}}\n*Battery: 180 [[Ampere hour|A\u00b7h]] ({{formatnum:{{#expr:180*3600}}}} [[Coulomb|C]])\n*''Source'':<ref name=\"Gemini B RM\" />\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160px\" >\nFile:Gemini2x.jpg|Flown [[Gemini spacecraft No. 2|Gemini B prototype]]\nFile: Blue Gemini Heat Shield.jpg|Heat shield with hatch\nFile: Blue Gemini Inside Display Panel.jpg|Display panel\nFile: Blue Gemini Nose.jpg|Gemini B nose\nFile:MOL control panel.jpg|Control panel\nFile:Gemini spacecraft interior.jpg|Spacecraft interior\n</gallery>\n\n==Spacesuits==\n[[File:MOL spacesuit.jpg|thumb|right|MOL MH-7 training spacesuit]]\nThe MOL program's requirements for a spacesuit were a product of the spacecraft design. The Gemini capsule had little room inside, and the MOL astronauts gained access to the laboratory through a hatch in the heat shield. This required a more flexible suit than those of NASA astronauts. The NASA astronauts had custom-made set of flight, training and backup suits, but for the MOL the intention was that spacesuits would be provided in standard sizes with adjustable elements. The USAF sounded out the [[David Clark Company]], [[International Latex Corporation]], [[B. F. Goodrich]] and [[Hamilton Standard]] in 1964. Hamilton Standard and David Clark each developed four prototype suits for the MOL.{{sfn|Thomas|McMann|2006|pp=212\u2013219}}\nA competition was held at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in January 1967, and a production contract awarded to Hamilton Standard. At least 17 blue MOL MH-7 training suits were delivered between May 1968 and July 1969. A single MH-8 flight configuration suit was delivered in October 1968 for certification testing. The flight suit was intended to be worn during launch and reentry.{{sfn|Thomas|McMann|2006|pp=223\u2013230}}\n\nThe contract for the launch/reentry suit was followed by a second competition in September 1967 for a suit for [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA).{{sfn|Thomas|McMann|2006|pp=230\u2013233}} This too was won by Hamilton Standard. The design was complicated by USAF concerns that a crew member might slip their tethers and float away. As a result, an  [[Astronaut propulsion unit#USAF Astronaut Maneuvering Unit|astronaut maneuvering unit]] (AMU) was developed and integrated with the life support system as an integrated maneuvering and life support system (IMLSS). The design was completed by October 1968, and a full prototype with cover garments was delivered in March 1969. The cover garments were never completed.{{sfn|Thomas|McMann|2006|pp=230\u2013233}}  \n==Astronauts==\n=== Selection ===\n{{see also|NASA Astronaut Group 7}}\n[[File:Manned Orbiting Laboratory Astronaut Group 1.jpg|thumb|right|First MOL astronaut group.

Four classes were conducted between June 1961, and May 1963. The third class received instruction on Dyna-Soar as part of the course. The USAF Experimental Test Pilot School was renamed the Aerospace Research Pilot School (ARPS) on 12 October 1961.{{sfn|Eppley|1963|pp=11\u201313}}{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=xxvi\u2013xxvii}} When it came to selecting astronauts for MOL, the commandant of the ARPS, Schriever took the advice of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Chuck Yeager|Charles E. \"Chuck\" Yeager]], the commandant of the ARPS, and restricted selection to ARPS graduates. No call for volunteers was issued; fifteen candidates were selected and ordered to report to [[Brooks Air Force Base]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]], for a week of medical evaluation in October 1964. The evaluations were similar to those conducted for the NASA astronaut groups.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=29}}{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nFor the selection of first three NASA astronaut groups in [[Mercury Seven|1959]], [[NASA Astronaut Group 2|1962]] and [[NASA Astronaut Group 3|1963]], the USAF had established a selection board to review candidates before forwarding their names to NASA. The Chief of Staff of the USAF, General [[John P. McConnell]], told Schriever he expected the selection of MOL astronauts to follow the same procedure. Accordingly, a selection board was convened in September 1965, chaired by Major General [[Jerry D. Page]]. On 15 September, the selection criteria for MOL was announced.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=5\u20136}} Candidates had to be:\n* Qualified military pilots;\n* Graduates of the ARPS;\n* Serving officers, recommended by their commanding officers; and\n* Holding US citizenship from birth.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=5\u20136}}\nIn October 1965, the MOL Policy Committee decided that MOL crew members would be designated a \"MOL Aerospace Research Pilots\" rather than astronauts.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=59}}\n\nThe names of the first group of eight MOL pilots were publicly announced on 12 November 1965:\n* [[Major (United States)|Major]] [[Michael J.

This time applications were called for, and the process was run concurrently with selection for [[NASA Astronaut Group 5]]. Over 500 applications were received, from which the names of 100 candidates were forwarded to USAF headquarters. The MOL program Office selected 25, who were sent to Brooks Air Force Base for physical evaluation in January and February 1966. Five were selected.

One was already attending; the other seven were sent to Edwards Air Force Base to join Class 66-B. They would be considered for the next MOL astronaut intake. The MOL Astronaut Selection Board met again on 11 May 1967, and recommended that four of the eight be appointed.

Phase II lasted for five months, and was conducted at the ARPS, where the astronauts were given technical training on the MOL vehicles and their operation procedures. This training was conducted in classrooms, in training flights, and win sessions on the T-27 space flight simulator. Phase III was continuous training on the MOL systems and providing crew input them. The pilots spent most of their time in this phase. Phase IV was training for specific missions. Simulators were developed for each of the different MOL systems. There was a Laboratory Module Simulator, Mission Payload Simulator, and Gemini B Procedures Simulator. Training was conducted in a [[zero-G]] environment on a [[Boeing C-135 Stratolifter]] [[reduced-gravity aircraft]]. A Flotation-Egress trainer allowed the astronauts to prepare for a splashdown and the possibility of the spacecraft sinking.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=54}}\n\nNASA had pioneered [[neutral buoyancy simulation as a training aid]] to simulate the space environment. The pilots were given [[scuba diving]] training at the U.S. Navy Underwater Swimmers School in [[Key West, Florida]]. Training was then conducted on a General Electric simulator on [[Buck Island National Wildlife Refuge|Buck Island]], near [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] in the [[United States Virgin Islands|US Virgin Islands]].  Water survival training was conducted at the USAF Sea Survival School at [[Homestead Air Force Base]] in Florida, and jungle survival training at the Tropical Survival School at [[Howard Air Force Base]] in the [[Panama Canal Zone]]. In July 1967, the pilots underwent training at the [[National Photographic Interpretation Center]] in Washington, DC.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=55\u201358}}\n\n==Facilities==\n===Launch complex===\n{{main|Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 6}}\nThe military director of the NRO, Brigadier General [[John L. Martin]] suggested that MOL launches be made from [[Cape Kennedy]], as launches from the West Coast would lead to the assumption that the mission was reconnaissance.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=37\u201338}} This was considered, but there were practical issues. MOL needed to be flown in a [[polar orbit]], but a launch due south from Cape Kennedy would overfly southern Florida, which raised safety concerns.<ref name=\"Vandenberg\" /> The [[TIROS]] [[weather satellite]]s had performed a \"dog leg\" maneuver, flying east and then south to avoid southern Florida. This required special State Department approval, as it meant overflying Cuba. The loss of a MOL with a classified payload over Cuba would not only be a danger to life and property, but a serious security concern as well. Moreover, the dog leg maneuver would reduce the {{convert|30000|lb|adj=on}} orbital payload by {{convert|2000|to|5000|lb|-2}}, reducing the equipment that could be carried or the duration of the mission or both. The cost of construction of a Titan III facility, including the purchase of the land, was estimated to cost $31 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|31,000,000|1966|r=2}} }} in {{Inflation/year|US}}), and the required supporting ground equipment would cost another $79 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|79,000,000|1966|r=2}} }} in {{Inflation/year|US}}).<ref name=\"Vandenberg\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/219.pdf |first=Harold |last=Brown |author-link=Harold Brown (Secretary of Defense)|title= Memorandum for Chairman Revers from Harold Brown, Subject: Determination of the Launch Site for MOL |date=14 March 1966 |publisher=National Reconnaissance Office |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>    \n\n[[File:SLC-6 in 1966.jpg|thumb|left|Space Launch Complex 6 under construction]]\nThe announcement that the MOL would be launched from the [[Western Test Range]] caused an outcry in the Florida news media, which decried it as a wasteful duplication of facilities, given that the recently completed $154 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|154,000,000|1966|r=2}} }} in {{Inflation/year|US}}) [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 41]] was specifically built to handle Titan III launches. The Chairman of the [[House Committee on Science and Astronautics]], Congressman [[George P. Miller]]from California, convened a special session on the MOL Program on 7 February 1966. The first witness, the Associate Administrator of NASA, [[Robert Seamans]], supported the MOL Program, and the decision to launch satellites into polar orbit from the West Coast, and said that NASA planned to launch weather satellites from there. He was followed by Schriever, who detailed the issues involved. The arguments did not satisfy Floridians. Hearings in the House were followed by ones in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] before the [[United States Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences|Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences]] on 24 February, chaired by the influential Senator [[Clinton P. Anderson]].   This time the witnesses were Seamans, Flax and [[John S. Foster Jr.]], Brown's successor as DDR&E. The logic of the arguments and the united front presented dampened criticism, and none of the nine members of the House from Florida opposed the 1966 MOL budget allocation.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=118\u2013123}}\n\nThe USAF attempted to purchase the land to the south of [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] for the new space launch complex from the owners, but negotiations failed to reach agreement on a suitable price. The government then went ahead and condemned the land under [[eminent domain]], compulsorily acquiring {{convert|14404.7|acre|ha}} from the Sudden Ranch and {{convert|499.1|acre|ha}} from the Scolari Ranch for $9,002,500 (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|9,002,500|1966}} }} in {{Inflation/year|US}}).

Brown soon received word that McNamara intended to limit the program to $150 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|150,000,000|1966|r=2}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}) in fiscal year 1967, the same allocation as in fiscal year 1966, in response to the rising cost of the [[Vietnam War]].{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=107}} In August 1965, the first uncrewed qualification flight had been expected to take place in late 1968, with the first crewed mission in early 1970,<ref name=\"Red Ink\" /><ref name=\"Chronology\" /> on the assumption that engineering development would commence in January 1966. Since this was now unlikely, McNamara saw no reason to continue with the original budget. Brown examined the schedules, and advised McNamara that a crewed mission in April 1969 would require a minimum of $294 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|294,000,000|1966|r=2}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}) in fiscal year 1967, and that the minimum budget that the MOL Program required was $230 million, which would impose a delay of the first flight of three to eighteen months. McNamara was unmoved, and $150 million was the sum requested in the President's budget submitted to Congress in January 1966.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=107}}\n\n[[File:MOL computers.jpg|thumb|left|The MOL program used state-of-the-art computers for design and simulation]]\nWhen the MOL engineering development phase commenced in September 1966, it became clear that the USAF estimates of project costs and those of the major contractors were a long way apart. McDonnell requested $205.5 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|205,500,000|1966|r=2}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}})for a fixed price plus incentive fee (FPIF) contract to design and build Gemini B, which the USAF budgeted $147.9 million; Douglas wanted $815.8 million for the laboratory vehicles which the USAF budgeted at $611.3 million; and General Electric sought $198 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|198,000,000|1966|r=2}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}) for work budgeted at $147.3 million. In response the MOL SPO reopened negotiations for systems not under contract, and halted the issuance of Dorian clearances to contractor personnel. This had the desired effect, and by December the major contractors had reduced their prices, bringing them closer to the USAF estimates. However, on 7 January, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) informed the MOL SPO that it intended to limit contracts in fiscal year 1968 to $430 million, which was $157 million short of what the MOL SPO wanted, and $381 below what the contractors wanted. This meant that the prime contracts had to be renegotiated,{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=143}}\n\nBudget cuts were not the only reason for the project's schedule slipping. On 9 December 1966, Eastman Kodak advised that it would not be able to deliver the optical sensors by the original target date of January 1969 for a crewed mission in April, and asked for a ten-month extension to October 1969, which pushed the date of the first crewed mission back to January 1970.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=108}} Eventually, $480 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|480,000,000|1966|r=2}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}) was found for fiscal year 1968, with $50 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|50,000,000|1966|r=2}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}) obtained by reprogramming funds from other programs, and $661 million agreed upon for fiscal year 1969.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=145}} To meet this, the date of the first qualification flight was pushed back still further, to December 1970, with the first crewed mission in August 1971.<ref name=\"Red Ink\">{{cite news |title=Blue Suits and Red Ink: Budget Overruns and Schedule Slips of the Manned Orbiting Laboratory Program |publisher=The Space Review |first=Dwayne |last=Day |author-link=Dwayne A.

This entailed yet another schedule slippage. On 15 July 1968, the MOL SPO convened a conference with major contractors in [[Valley Forge, Pennsylvania]], and it was agreed to defer the first crewed mission from August to December 1971.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=150\u2013151}}\n\n==Cancellation==\nA few months after MOL development began, the program also began developing an [[KH-10 Dorian|automated version]], replacing the crew compartment with film reentry vehicles. In February 1966, Schriever commissioned a report examining humans' usefulness on the station. The report, which was submitted on 25 May,  concluded that they would be useful in several ways, but implied that the program would always need to justify the cost and difficulty of manned MOL versus the unmanned version. Although it did not fly until July 1966, the authors were aware of the capabilities of the KH-8 Gambit 3.

Humans added flexibility, but complicated spacecraft design]]\nThe report pointed out that crewed systems had many advantages over automated ones, which lost up to half their images to cloud cover on a typical mission. A human could select the best angle for a photograph, and could switch between color and infrared, or some other special film, depending on the target. This was especially useful for dealing with camouflaged targets. The MOL also had the ability to change orbits, and could shift from its regular {{convert|80|nmi|km|adj=on}} orbit to a {{convert|200|to|300|nmi|km|adj=on}} one, giving it a view of the entire Soviet Union.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=102}} Experience on Projects [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], Gemini and the X-15 had demonstrated that crew initiative, innovation and improvisation was often the difference between success and failure of the mission.<ref name=\"The Measure of a Man (Part 1)\" /> The practicality of human recconnaisance from space was demonstrated on the [[Gemini 5]] mission, which conducted 17 USAF military experiments, including photographing missile launches from Vandenberg Air Force Base, and observations of the [[White Sands Proving Ground]].{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=148\u2013149}}\n\nDebate also persisted about the value of the very high resolution (VHR) imaging being developed for the MOL and [[KH-9 Hexagon]], or whether the resolution provided by Gambit 3 was sufficient.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=74\u201375}} In the wake of the [[Liberty incident|''Liberty'' incident]] in June 1967 and the [[Pueblo incident|''Pueblo'' incident]] in January 1968, there was an increased focus on intelligence gathering by satellite. The Director of Central Intelligence, [[Richard M. Helms]], commissioned a report on the value of VHR, which was completed in May 1968. It concluded that it would help identify smaller items and features, and increase the understanding of Soviet procedures and processes, and the capacities of some of its industrial facilities, it would not alter estimates of technical capabilities, or assessments of the size and deployment of forces. The question of whether the cost justified the benefit was left open.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=148\u2013149}}\n\n[[File:MOL hardware under construction.jpg|thumb|left|MOL hardware under construction]]\nOn 20 January 1969, [[Richard Nixon]] was sworn in as President.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=155}} He directed Director of the new  [[Bureau of the Budget]], [[Robert Mayo]], and Secretary of Defense, [[Melvin Laird]] to find ways to cut defense spending.{{sfn|David|2017|p=769}} The MOL was an obvious target; an article in the ''[[Washington Monthly]]'' titled \"How The Pentagon Can Save $9 Billion\", written by Robert S. Benson, a former Department of Defense employee, described the MOL as a program that \"receives a half a billion dollars a year and ought to rank dead last on any rational scale of national priorities.\"{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=157}} Stewart briefed the new [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense|Deputy Secretary of Defense]], [[David Packard]], on the MOL, which Stewart described as the best path to VHR at the earliest date. Laird, who as a Congressman had criticized McNamara for inadequately funding the MOL Program, was favorably disposed towards the MOL Program, as was Seamans, who was now the Secretary of the Air Force. On 6 March, Packard directed Foster to proceed on the basis of $556 million for fiscal year 1970 (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|556,000,000|1969|r=2}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}). This entailed postponement of the first crewed mission to February 1972.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\nThe Bureau of the Budget did not accept Laird's decision.  Mayo argued that the resolution provided by Gambit 3, and proposed canceling both the MOL and Hexagon. A MOL mission was expected to cost $150 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|150,000,000|1969|r=2}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}), but a Gambit 3 launch only cost $23 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|23,000,000|1969|r=2}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}). The value of VLR, Mayo argued, was not worth the additional cost. On 9 April, Nixon reduce the MOL's funding to $360 million, and canceled Hexagon. This meant further postponement of the first crewed flight, by up to a year, and the Bureau of the Budget continued to press for the MOL to be cancelled. In a last ditch attempt to save the MOL, Laird, Seamans and Stewart met with Nixon at the White House on 17 May, and briefed him on the history of the program. Seamans even offered to find $250 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|250,000,000|1969|r=2}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}) to continue the program from elsewhere in the USAF budget. They thought the meeting went well, but Nixon accepted the Bureau of the Budget's recommendation to cancel the MOL and proceed with Hexagon instead.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=158\u2013162}}\n\nOn 7 June, Stewart ordered Bleymaier to cease all work on Gemini B, the Titan IIIM, and the MOL spacesuit, and to cancel or curtail all other contracts. The official announcement that the MOL was canceled was made on 10 June.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=162\u2013163}}{{sfn|Heppenheimer|1998|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n== Legacy ==\nFollowing the decision to cancel the project, a committee was formed to handle the disposal of its property, valued at $12.5 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|12,500,000|1969|r=2}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}). The MOL's Acquisition and Tracking System, Mission Development Simulator, Laboratory Module Simulator and Mission Simulator were transferred to NASA by the end of 1973. The MOL program office at the Pentagon closed on 15 February 1970, and the office in Los Angeles on 30 September 1970.

The project was developed from early United States Air Force (USAF) and [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) concepts of crewed [[space station]]s to be used for [[reconnaissance]] purposes.  MOL evolved into a single-use laboratory, with which crews would be launched on 40-day missions and return to Earth using a '''Gemini B''' spacecraft, derived from NASA's [[Gemini spacecraft]].\n\nThe MOL program was announced to the public on 10 December 1963 as an inhabited platform to prove the utility of putting people in space for military missions. Astronauts selected for the program were later told of the reconnaissance mission for the program. The prime contractor for the spacecraft was [[McDonnell Aircraft]]; the laboratory was built by the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]]. The Gemini B was externally similar to NASA's Gemini spacecraft, although it underwent several modifications, including the addition of a circular hatch through the heat shield, which allowed passage between the spacecraft and the laboratory. [[Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 6]] was developed to permit launches into [[polar orbit]].\n\nMOL competed with the [[Vietnam War]] for funds, and was beset by budget cuts that caused the date of the first operational flight to be repeatedly postponed. A single [[OPS 0855|uncrewed test flight]] was launched on 3 November 1966. The program was canceled in June 1969, after it was demonstrated that automated [[reconnaissance satellite]]s were more cost-effective.\n\n== Background ==\nAt the height of the [[Cold War]] in the mid-1950s, the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) was particularly interested in reconnaissance from space, as there was intense interest in the [[Soviet Union]]'s military and industrial capabilities. In July 1957\u2014before anyone had flown in space\u2014the USAF [[Wright Air Development Center]] had published a paper the employment of space vehicles that considered the development of a space station equipped with telescopes and other observation devices.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=2}} The USAF already started a satellite program in 1956 called WS-117L. It had three components: [[Samos (satellite)|SAMOS]], a spy satellite; [[Corona (satellite)|Discoverer]], an experimental program to develop the technology; and [[Missile Defense Alarm System|MIDAS]], an early warning system.{{sfn|Divine|1993|p=11}}\n\n[[File:Bernard Adolph Schriever.jpg|thumb|right|General [[Bernard Adolph Schriever]] ]]\nThe launch of [[Sputnik 1]], the first [[satellite]], by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957, came as a profound shock to the American public, which had complacently assumed American technical superiority, and sparked a search for initiatives to counter its psychological impact.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=28\u201329, 37}}{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=1}} The [[Sputnik crisis]] had a silver lining: no government protested Sputnik's overflying their territory, thereby tacitly acknowledging the legality of satellites. While there was a big difference between the innocuous Sputnik and a spy satellite, it made it all that much harder for the Soviets to object to one.{{sfn|Divine|1993|pp=11\u201312}} Starting in 1956, the United States had conducted covert [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy plane overflights of the Soviet Union. Twenty-four U-2 missions produced images of about 15 percent of the country with a maximum resolution of {{convert|2|ft}} before the [[1960 U-2 incident|downing of a U-2 in 1960]] abruptly ended the program.{{sfn|David|2017|p=768}} This left a gap in American espionage capabilities that it was hoped that spy satellites would be able to fill.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=2\u20133}}  In February 1958, in the wake of Sputnik, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] ordered the USAF to proceed as quickly as possible with Discover (also known as Corona) as a joint [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA)-USAF interim project.{{sfn|Wheeldon|1998|p=33}}{{sfn|Day|1998|p=49}}\n\nOn 18 August 1958, Eisenhower decided to give responsibility for most forms of human space flight to the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA). [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald A. Quarles]] transferred $53.8 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|53,800,000|1958|r=2}} }} in {{Inflation/year|US}}) that that had been set aside for USAF space projects, including Man in Space Soonest to NASA.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=101\u2013102}} This left the USAF with a small number of programs with a direct military impact.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=4}} One was a delta-wing, rocket-propelled glider that came to be called the [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar]].{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=71}} The USAF remained interested in space, and March 1959, the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[Thomas D. White]] asked the USAF Director of Development Planning to prepare a long-range plan for a USAF space program. One project identified in the resulting document was a \"manned orbital laboratory\".{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=5}}\n\nThe USAF [[Air Research and Development Command]] (ARDC) issued a request to the [[Aeronautical Systems Division]] (ASD) at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] on 1 September 1959 for a formal study to be conducted of a military test space station (MTSS). The ASD asked components of the ARDC for suggestions as to what sort of experiments would be suitable for an MTSS, and 125 proposals were received. Twelve contractors made proposals. A [[request for proposal]] (RFP) was then issued on 19 February 1960, and twelve firms responded. On 15 August, [[General Electric]], [[Lockheed Aircraft]], [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin]], [[McDonnell Aircraft]], and [[General Dynamics]] were awarded $574,999 (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|574,999|1961}} }} in {{Inflation/year|US}}) for a study of the MTSS.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=5}} Their preliminary reports were submitted in January 1961, and final reports were received by July. With these in hand, on 16 August 1961 the USAF submitted a request for $5 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|5,000,000|1961|r=2}} }} in {{Inflation/year|US}}) in funding for space station studies in [[fiscal year]] 1963, but no funding was forthcoming.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=6\u20138}}\n\n[[File:MOL patch from NRO.jpg|thumb|left|MOL patch]]\nIn its 26 April 1961 project plan, Dyna-Soar was to be launched into space on a suborbital ballistic trajectory by a [[Titan I]] booster, with its first piloted suborbital flight in April 1965, followed by its first piloted orbital flight in April 1966,{{sfn|Houchin|1995|p=273}} but concerns were raised as to whether over whether permission to land in Brazil would be forthcoming.{{sfn|Houchin|1995|p=279}}  In a 22 February memorandum to the  [[Secretary of the Air Force]], [[Eugene Zuckert]], McNamara decided to fast track Dyna-Soar and save money by skipping the suborbital testing phase. Dyna-Soar would be launched into orbit by a [[Titan III]] booster.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=6\u20138}}{{sfn|Erickson|2005|p=353}}{{sfn|Houchin|1995|p=311}}\n\nThe same 22 February memorandum tacit approval for the development of a space station. With this in hand, the USAF staff and the [[Air Force Systems Command]] (AFSC) began planning for a space station, which was now known as a [[Manned Orbital Development System|military orbital development system]] (MODS). By the end of May, a proposed system package plan (PSPP) had been drawn up for MODS, which was designated Program 287. MODS consisted of a space station, a modified NASA [[Gemini spacecraft]] that became known as [[Blue Gemini]], and a Titan III launch vehicle. The space station was expected to provide a [[shirt-sleeve environment]] for a crew of four for up to 30 days.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=6\u20138}} On 25 August 1962, Zuckert informed General [[Bernard Adolph Schriever]], the commander of the AFSC, that he was to proceed with studies of the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) as the director of the program.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=10}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/2.pdf |title=Memorandum for Director, Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) Program \u2013 Subject: Authorization To Proceed With MOL Program |first=Eugene |last=Zuckert |author-link=Eugene Zuckert |publisher=Department of Defence |date=25 August 1962 |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 November 1962, Zuckert submitted his proposals to McNamara. For fiscal year 1964, he requested $75 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|75,000,000|1962|r=2}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}) in funding for MODS and $102 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|102,000,000|1961|r=2}} }} in {{Inflation/year|US}})  for Blue Gemini.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=10}} This involved some negotiation with NASA, but McNamara and [[NASA Administrator]] reached an agreement on cooperation on Project Gemini on 21 January 1963.{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|2010|pp=120\u2013122}} On 18 January 1963, McNamara called for a review of Dyna-Soar, specifically whether it had a military capability that could not be met by Gemini. In his 14 November response, the [[Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering|Director of Defense Research and Engineering]] (DDR&E), [[Harold Brown (Secretary of Defense)|Harold Brown]], examined various options for a space station. He preferred a four-man station that would be launched separately and crewed by astronauts arriving in Gemini spacecraft. Crews would rotate every 30 days, with resupply arriving every 120 days.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=25\u201327}}{{sfn|Erickson|2005|pp=370\u2013371}} On 10 December 1963, McNamara issued a press release that officially announced the cancellation of Dyna-Soar and the initiation the MOL program.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/6.pdf |title=Air Force to Develop Manned Orbiting Laboratory |publisher=Department of Defence |date=10 December 1963 |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nSoon after coming to office, the [[Kennedy administration]] tightened security regarding spy satellites in response to Soviet sensitivities.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=37\u201338}} No administration official could even admit they existed until President [[Jimmy Carter]] did so in 1978.{{sfn|Erickson|2005|pp=378\u2013379}} MOL therefore became a semi-secret project, with a public face but a covert reconnaissance mission, similar to that of the Discoverer/Corona spy satellite program.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=8}}\n\n==Planning==\n[[File:Major General Joseph S. Bleymaier Jr.jpg|thumb|right|Major General Joseph S. Bleymaier Jr.]]\nOn 16 December 1963, USAF Headquarters ordered Schriever to submit a development plan for the MOL.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=36}} About $6 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|6,000,000|1964|r=2}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}) was spent on preliminary studies, most of which were completed by September 1964. McDonnell prepared a study of the Gemini B spacecraft, [[Martin Marietta]] of the Titan III booster,{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=4\u20135}} and [[Eastman Kodak]] of camera optics.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=37\u201338}}  Other studies examined key MOL subsystems such as environmental control, electrical power, navigation, attitude control stabilization, guidance, communications, and radar.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=43\u201344}} The [[United States Under Secretary of the Air Force]] and the Director of the [[National Reconnaissance Office]] (NRO), [[Brockway McMillan]], asked the NRO Program A Director (responsible for the Air Force aspects of NRO activities), [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Robert Evans Greer]], to look into its potential reconnaissance capabilities.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=4\u20135}} In all, $3,237,716 (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|3,237,716|1964}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}) was expended on these studies. The most expensive was of the Gemini B spacecraft, which cost $1,189,500 (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|1,189,500|1964}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}), followed by the Titan III interface, which cost $910,000 (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|910,000|1964}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}).{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=43\u201344}}  \n\nWith these studies in hand, the USAF issued an RFP to twenty firms in January 1965. At the end of February, [[Boeing]], [[Douglas Aircraft|Douglas]], General Electric and [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] were selected to carry out design studies.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=4\u20135}} Covert NRO activities to be carried out by MOL were classified [[classified information#Secret|secret]] and given the code name \"Dorian\".{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=40}} In February 1969 the MOL was given a [[Key Hole]] designation as KH-10 Dorian.<ref>{{cite web |title= Designation of MOL as the KH-10 Photographic Reconnaissance Satellite System |date=14 February 1968 |first=James T. |last=Stewart |author-link=James T. Stewart |publisher=National Reconnaissance Office |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/680.pdf |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> The MOL needed some \"white\" experiments as cover. An MOL Experiments Working Group was created under Colonel William Brady. Some 400 experiments proposed by various agencies were examined. These were consolidated and reduced to 59, and twelve primary and eighteen secondary ones were selected. A 499-page report on the experiments was issued on 1 April 1964.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=40\u201341}}\n\nThe USAF recommended that the MOL use the Gemini B spacecraft with the Titan III booster. A program of six flights (one uncrewed and five crewed) was proposed, with the first flight taking place in 1966. The program was costed at $1.653 billion (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|1,653,000,000|1964|r=2}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}). The [[Science Advisor to the President]], [[Donald Hornig]], reviewed the USAF's submission. He noted that for the sophisticated reconnaissance missions proposed, a human-operated system was far superior to an automated one, but speculated that with sufficient effort, thr gap between the two could be reduced.

This was much smaller than many of targets that the NRO was interested in, like air bases, shipyards and missile ranges, so the astronauts had only limited time to respond as the MOL passed overherad.

Of 159 [[KH-7 Gambit]] photographs of the area, only 9 percent showed missiles on the launch pads, and of 77 photographs of missile silos, only 21 percent were with the doors open. The analysts identified 60 MOL targets in the complex. Only two or three could be photographed on each pass, but the astronauts could select the most interesting ones on the spur of the moment, and photograph them with greater resolution than Gambit.

It would be launched together with the MOL modules. Once in orbit, the crew would power down the capsule and activate and enter the laboratory module. After about one month of space station operations, the crew would return to the Gemini B capsule, power it up, separate from the station, and perform [[atmospheric entry|reentry]]. Gemini B had an autonomy of about 14 hours once detached from MOL.<ref name=\"Gunter\" /><ref name=\"Gemini B RM\" /><ref name=\"Gemini B\" />\n\nExternally Gemini B was similar to Gemini, but there were many differences. The most noticeable was that it featured a rear hatch for the crew to enter MOL. Notches were cut into the ejection seat headrests to allow access to hatch. The seats were therefore a mirror image of each other instead of being the same. Gemini B also had a Larger diameter heat shield to handle higher energy reentry from polar orbit. The number of reentry control system thrusters was increased from four to six.  There was no [[orbit attitude and maneuvering system]] (OAMS), because capsule orientation for reentry was handled by the forward reentry control system thrusters, and the laboratory module had its own reaction control system for orientation.<ref name=\"Gunter\" /><ref name=\"Gemini B RM\" /><ref name=\"Gemini B\" />\n\nThe Gemini B systems were designed for long term orbital storage (40 days) but equipment for long duration flights was removed since Gemini B capsule itself was only to be used for launch and reentry. It had a different cockpit layout and instruments. As a result of the [[Apollo 1]] fire, the MOL was switched to use a [[Heliox|helium-oxygen]] atmosphere instead of pure oxygen one. At takeoff, the astronauts would breathe pure oxygen in their spacesuits while the cabin was presurized with helium. It would then be brought up to a helium-oxygen mix.<ref name=\"Gunter\">{{cite web |title=Gemini-B |url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/gemini-b.htm  |publisher=Gunter's Space Page. |access-date= 5 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Gemini B RM\">{{cite web |title=Gemini B RM |website=Astronautix.com |url=http://www.astronautix.com/g/geminibrm.html |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Gemini B\">{{cite web |url=http://www.space1.com/pdf/news1096.pdf |issue=1 |date=September 1996 |title=Gemini B NASA-Gemini's Air Force Twin |access-date=5 April 2020 |publisher=Historic Space Systems}}</ref>\n\n===Reentry module specifications===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*Crew: 2\n*Maximum duration: 40 days\n*Length: {{convert|3.35|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n*Diameter: {{convert|2.32|m|ftin|abbr=on}}\n*Cabin volume: {{convert|2.55|m3|cuft|abbr=on}}\n*Gross mass: {{convert|1983|kg|abbr=on}}\n*RCS thrusters: {{cvt|16|\u00d7|98|N}}\n*RCS impulse: {{convert|283|isp}}\n*Electric system: {{cvt|4|kWh}}\n*Battery: 180 [[Ampere hour|A\u00b7h]] ({{formatnum:{{#expr:180*3600}}}} [[Coulomb|C]])\n*''Source'':<ref name=\"Gemini B RM\" />\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160px\" >\nFile:Gemini2x.jpg|Flown [[Gemini spacecraft No. 2|Gemini B prototype]]\nFile: Blue Gemini Heat Shield.jpg|Heat shield with hatch\nFile: Blue Gemini Inside Display Panel.jpg|Display panel\nFile: Blue Gemini Nose.jpg|Gemini B nose\nFile:MOL control panel.jpg|Control panel\nFile:Gemini spacecraft interior.jpg|Spacecraft interior\n</gallery>\n\n==Spacesuits==\n[[File:MOL spacesuit.jpg|thumb|right|MOL MH-7 training spacesuit]]\nThe MOL program's requirements for a spacesuit were a product of the spacecraft design. The Gemini capsule had little room inside, and the MOL astronauts gained access to the laboratory through a hatch in the heat shield. This required a more flexible suit than those of NASA astronauts. The NASA astronauts had custom-made set of flight, training and backup suits, but for the MOL the intention was that spacesuits would be provided in standard sizes with adjustable elements. The USAF sounded out the [[David Clark Company]], [[International Latex Corporation]], [[B. F. Goodrich]] and [[Hamilton Standard]] in 1964. Hamilton Standard and David Clark each developed four prototype suits for the MOL.{{sfn|Thomas|McMann|2006|pp=212\u2013219}}\nA competition was held at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in January 1967, and a production contract awarded to Hamilton Standard. At least 17 blue MOL MH-7 training suits were delivered between May 1968 and July 1969. A single MH-8 flight configuration suit was delivered in October 1968 for certification testing. The flight suit was intended to be worn during launch and reentry.{{sfn|Thomas|McMann|2006|pp=223\u2013230}}\n\nThe contract for the launch/reentry suit was followed by a second competition in September 1967 for a suit for [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA).{{sfn|Thomas|McMann|2006|pp=230\u2013233}} This too was won by Hamilton Standard. The design was complicated by USAF concerns that a crew member might slip their tethers and float away. As a result, an  [[Astronaut propulsion unit#USAF Astronaut Maneuvering Unit|astronaut maneuvering unit]] (AMU) was developed and integrated with the life support system as an integrated maneuvering and life support system (IMLSS). The design was completed by October 1968, and a full prototype with cover garments was delivered in March 1969. The cover garments were never completed.{{sfn|Thomas|McMann|2006|pp=230\u2013233}}  \n==Astronauts==\n=== Selection ===\n{{see also|NASA Astronaut Group 7}}\n[[File:Manned Orbiting Laboratory Astronaut Group 1.jpg|thumb|right|First MOL astronaut group.

Four classes were conducted between June 1961, and May 1963. The third class received instruction on Dyna-Soar as part of the course. The USAF Experimental Test Pilot School was renamed the Aerospace Research Pilot School (ARPS) on 12 October 1961.{{sfn|Eppley|1963|pp=11\u201313}}{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=xxvi\u2013xxvii}} When it came to selecting astronauts for MOL, the commandant of the ARPS, Schriever took the advice of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Chuck Yeager|Charles E. \"Chuck\" Yeager]], the commandant of the ARPS, and restricted selection to ARPS graduates. No call for volunteers was issued; fifteen candidates were selected and ordered to report to [[Brooks Air Force Base]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]], for a week of medical evaluation in October 1964. The evaluations were similar to those conducted for the NASA astronaut groups.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=29}}{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nFor the selection of first three NASA astronaut groups in [[Mercury Seven|1959]], [[NASA Astronaut Group 2|1962]] and [[NASA Astronaut Group 3|1963]], the USAF had established a selection board to review candidates before forwarding their names to NASA. The Chief of Staff of the USAF, General [[John P. McConnell]], told Schriever he expected the selection of MOL astronauts to follow the same procedure. Accordingly, a selection board was convened in September 1965, chaired by Major General [[Jerry D. Page]]. On 15 September, the selection criteria for MOL was announced.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=5\u20136}} Candidates had to be:\n* Qualified military pilots;\n* Graduates of the ARPS;\n* Serving officers, recommended by their commanding officers; and\n* Holding US citizenship from birth.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=5\u20136}}\nIn October 1965, the MOL Policy Committee decided that MOL crew members would be designated a \"MOL Aerospace Research Pilots\" rather than astronauts.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=59}}\n\nThe names of the first group of eight MOL pilots were publicly announced on 12 November 1965:\n* [[Major (United States)|Major]] [[Michael J.

This time applications were called for, and the process was run concurrently with selection for [[NASA Astronaut Group 5]]. Over 500 applications were received, from which the names of 100 candidates were forwarded to USAF headquarters. The MOL program Office selected 25, who were sent to Brooks Air Force Base for physical evaluation in January and February 1966. Five were selected. The names of the second group of MOL pilots were publicly announced on 17 June 1966:\n* Captain [[Karol J. Bobko]], USAF\n* Lieutenant [[Robert L. Crippen]], USN\n* Captain [[C.

One was already attending; the other seven were sent to Edwards Air Force Base to join Class 66-B. They would be considered for the next MOL astronaut intake. The MOL Astronaut Selection Board met again on 11 May 1967, and recommended that four of the eight be appointed. The MOL Program Office announced names of those selected for the third group of MOL astronauts on 30 June 1967, at a press conference in Los Angeles:\n* Major [[James A.

Phase II lasted for five months, and was conducted at the ARPS, where the astronauts were given technical training on the MOL vehicles and their operation procedures. This training was conducted in classrooms, in training flights, and win sessions on the T-27 space flight simulator. Phase III was continuous training on the MOL systems and providing crew input them. The pilots spent most of their time in this phase. Phase IV was training for specific missions. Simulators were developed for each of the different MOL systems. There was a Laboratory Module Simulator, Mission Payload Simulator, and Gemini B Procedures Simulator. Training was conducted in a [[zero-G]] environment on a [[Boeing C-135 Stratolifter]] [[reduced-gravity aircraft]]. A Flotation-Egress trainer allowed the astronauts to prepare for a splashdown and the possibility of the spacecraft sinking.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=54}}\n\nNASA had pioneered [[neutral buoyancy simulation as a training aid]] to simulate the space environment. The pilots were given [[scuba diving]] training at the U.S. Navy Underwater Swimmers School in [[Key West, Florida]]. Training was then conducted on a General Electric simulator on [[Buck Island National Wildlife Refuge|Buck Island]], near [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] in the [[United States Virgin Islands|US Virgin Islands]].  Water survival training was conducted at the USAF Sea Survival School at [[Homestead Air Force Base]] in Florida, and jungle survival training at the Tropical Survival School at [[Howard Air Force Base]] in the [[Panama Canal Zone]]. In July 1967, the pilots underwent training at the [[National Photographic Interpretation Center]] in Washington, DC.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=55\u201358}}\n\n==Facilities==\n===Launch complex===\n{{main|Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 6}}\nThe military director of the NRO, Brigadier General [[John L. Martin]] suggested that MOL launches be made from [[Cape Kennedy]], as launches from the West Coast would lead to the assumption that the mission was reconnaissance.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=37\u201338}} This was considered, but there were practical issues. MOL needed to be flown in a [[polar orbit]], but a launch due south from Cape Kennedy would overfly southern Florida, which raised safety concerns.<ref name=\"Vandenberg\" /> The [[TIROS]] [[weather satellite]]s had performed a \"dog leg\" maneuver, flying east and then south to avoid southern Florida. This required special State Department approval, as it meant overflying Cuba.

The Chairman of the [[House Committee on Science and Astronautics]], Congressman [[George P. Miller]]from California, convened a special session on the MOL Program on 7 February 1966. The first witness, the Associate Administrator of NASA, [[Robert Seamans]], supported the MOL Program, and the decision to launch satellites into polar orbit from the West Coast, and said that NASA planned to launch weather satellites from there. He was followed by Schriever, who detailed the issues involved. The arguments did not satisfy Floridians. Hearings in the House were followed by ones in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] before the [[United States Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences|Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences]] on 24 February, chaired by the influential Senator [[Clinton P.

In November 1965, Flax arbitrarily cut $20 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|20,000,000|1965|r=2}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}) from the MOL Program's fiscal year 1967 budget, bringing it down to $374 million. Brown soon received word that McNamara intended to limit the program to $150 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|150,000,000|1966|r=2}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}) in fiscal year 1967, the same allocation as in fiscal year 1966, in response to the rising cost of the [[Vietnam War]].{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=107}} In August 1965, the first uncrewed qualification flight had been expected to take place in late 1968, with the first crewed mission in early 1970,<ref name=\"Red Ink\" /><ref name=\"Chronology\" /> on the assumption that engineering development would commence in January 1966. Since this was now unlikely, McNamara saw no reason to continue with the original budget. Brown examined the schedules, and advised McNamara that a crewed mission in April 1969 would require a minimum of $294 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|294,000,000|1966|r=2}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}) in fiscal year 1967, and that the minimum budget that the MOL Program required was $230 million, which would impose a delay of the first flight of three to eighteen months. McNamara was unmoved, and $150 million was the sum requested in the President's budget submitted to Congress in January 1966.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=107}}\n\n[[File:MOL computers.jpg|thumb|left|The MOL program used state-of-the-art computers for design and simulation]]\nWhen the MOL engineering development phase commenced in September 1966, it became clear that the USAF estimates of project costs and those of the major contractors were a long way apart. McDonnell requested $205.5 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|205,500,000|1966|r=2}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}})for a fixed price plus incentive fee (FPIF) contract to design and build Gemini B, which the USAF budgeted $147.9 million; Douglas wanted $815.8 million for the laboratory vehicles which the USAF budgeted at $611.3 million; and General Electric sought $198 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|198,000,000|1966|r=2}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}) for work budgeted at $147.3 million. In response the MOL SPO reopened negotiations for systems not under contract, and halted the issuance of Dorian clearances to contractor personnel. This had the desired effect, and by December the major contractors had reduced their prices, bringing them closer to the USAF estimates. However, on 7 January, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) informed the MOL SPO that it intended to limit contracts in fiscal year 1968 to $430 million, which was $157 million short of what the MOL SPO wanted, and $381 below what the contractors wanted. This meant that the prime contracts had to be renegotiated,{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=143}}\n\nBudget cuts were not the only reason for the project's schedule slipping. On 9 December 1966, Eastman Kodak advised that it would not be able to deliver the optical sensors by the original target date of January 1969 for a crewed mission in April, and asked for a ten-month extension to October 1969, which pushed the date of the first crewed mission back to January 1970.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=108}} Eventually, $480 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|480,000,000|1966|r=2}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}) was found for fiscal year 1968, with $50 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|50,000,000|1966|r=2}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}) obtained by reprogramming funds from other programs, and $661 million agreed upon for fiscal year 1969.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=145}} To meet this, the date of the first qualification flight was pushed back still further, to December 1970, with the first crewed mission in August 1971.<ref name=\"Red Ink\">{{cite news |title=Blue Suits and Red Ink: Budget Overruns and Schedule Slips of the Manned Orbiting Laboratory Program |publisher=The Space Review |first=Dwayne |last=Day |author-link=Dwayne A.

A human could select the best angle for a photograph, and could switch between color and infrared, or some other special film, depending on the target. This was especially useful for dealing with camouflaged targets. The MOL also had the ability to change orbits, and could shift from its regular {{convert|80|nmi|km|adj=on}} orbit to a {{convert|200|to|300|nmi|km|adj=on}} one, giving it a view of the entire Soviet Union.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=102}} Experience on Projects [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], Gemini and the X-15 had demonstrated that crew initiative, innovation and improvisation was often the difference between success and failure of the mission.<ref name=\"The Measure of a Man (Part 1)\" /> The practicality of human recconnaisance from space was demonstrated on the [[Gemini 5]] mission, which conducted 17 USAF military experiments, including photographing missile launches from Vandenberg Air Force Base, and observations of the [[White Sands Proving Ground]].{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=148\u2013149}}\n\nDebate also persisted about the value of the very high resolution (VHR) imaging being developed for the MOL and [[KH-9 Hexagon]], or whether the resolution provided by Gambit 3 was sufficient.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=74\u201375}} In the wake of the [[Liberty incident|''Liberty'' incident]] in June 1967 and the [[Pueblo incident|''Pueblo'' incident]] in January 1968, there was an increased focus on intelligence gathering by satellite. The Director of Central Intelligence, [[Richard M. Helms]], commissioned a report on the value of VHR, which was completed in May 1968. It concluded that it would help identify smaller items and features, and increase the understanding of Soviet procedures and processes, and the capacities of some of its industrial facilities, it would not alter estimates of technical capabilities, or assessments of the size and deployment of forces. The question of whether the cost justified the benefit was left open.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=148\u2013149}}\n\n[[File:MOL hardware under construction.jpg|thumb|left|MOL hardware under construction]]\nOn 20 January 1969, [[Richard Nixon]] was sworn in as President.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=155}} He directed Director of the new  [[Bureau of the Budget]], [[Robert Mayo]], and Secretary of Defense, [[Melvin Laird]] to find ways to cut defense spending.{{sfn|David|2017|p=769}} The MOL was an obvious target; an article in the ''[[Washington Monthly]]'' titled \"How The Pentagon Can Save $9 Billion\", written by Robert S.

On 6 March, Packard directed Foster to proceed on the basis of $556 million for fiscal year 1970 (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|556,000,000|1969|r=2}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}). This entailed postponement of the first crewed mission to February 1972.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\nThe Bureau of the Budget did not accept Laird's decision.  Mayo argued that the resolution provided by Gambit 3, and proposed canceling both the MOL and Hexagon. A MOL mission was expected to cost $150 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|150,000,000|1969|r=2}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}), but a Gambit 3 launch only cost $23 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|23,000,000|1969|r=2}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}). The value of VLR, Mayo argued, was not worth the additional cost. On 9 April, Nixon reduce the MOL's funding to $360 million, and canceled Hexagon. This meant further postponement of the first crewed flight, by up to a year, and the Bureau of the Budget continued to press for the MOL to be cancelled. In a last ditch attempt to save the MOL, Laird, Seamans and Stewart met with Nixon at the White House on 17 May, and briefed him on the history of the program. Seamans even offered to find $250 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|250,000,000|1969|r=2}} }}  in {{Inflation/year|US}}) to continue the program from elsewhere in the USAF budget.
