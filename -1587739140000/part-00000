Celty learned from Izaya that an old street artist saw a [[dullahan]] missing its head. Celty quickly goes to find the artist, but cannot find him. Shizuo knows where the artist is and helps her talk to him. However, they find that the artist could not draw the head of the dullahan because he had no knowledge of its appearance.

A teacher named [[List of Durarara!! characters#Takashi Nasujima|Takashi Nasujima]] tries to molest Anri, but Masaomi prevents him from doing so. Mikado and Masaomi warn her to stay away from Nasujima. Anri tells them about Mika and her association with Seiji. Mika was previously using Anri to make herself look better. However, Mika disappeared shortly before school began due to being heartbroken, taking a vacation to relieve her grief, which is possibly referring to how Seiji rejected Mika because she stalked him. Mikado and Masaomi believe that the police should handle her disappearance. As Masaomi walks home, he tells himself that he must keep Mikado away from the dark side of the district because Masaomi himself has already been there, and he also notes that he gained courage since Mikado came to Ikebukuro.
