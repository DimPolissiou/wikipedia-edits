However, if a band of muscle forms around one of the coronary arteries during the fetal stage of development, then a myocardial bridge is formed - a \"bridge\" of heart muscle over the artery. Each time the heart squeezes to pump blood, the band of muscle exerts pressure and constricts the artery, reducing blood flow to the heart. This defect is present from birth. It is important to note that even a very thin ex. < 1&nbsp;mm and/or short ex. 20&nbsp;mm MB can cause significant symptoms. MBs can range from a few mm in length to 10&nbsp;cm or more.\n\n==Prevalence==\nThe true prevalence of MBs is still largely unknown, as studies have made vastly different assessments.

As a result of these studies and others, an estimated prevalence of approximately 25% is generally accepted.}}\n\n==Symptoms==\nWhile many people have very tiny myocardial bridges that cause no symptoms, others have longer and/or deeper bridges causing significant symptoms, including children.

These include:\n*angina pectoris (chest pain radiating from the heart)\n*endothelial dysfunction, which causes vasospasms - both sometimes very severe\n*arrhythmia (irregular heartbeats)\n*tachycardia (abnormally high heart rate)\n*plaque forming just before (proximal to) the myocardial bridge\n\nNote that studies have shown that plaque does not form inside myocardial bridges, yet there is virtually always plaque just before the myocardial bridge in adults.\n\nSome common triggers of myocardial bridge symptoms are:\n*exertion/exercise\n*anything that raises the heart rate, even positive events\n*low-oxygen environments ex. hot humid weather, high altitude\n*sitting/lying/doing nothing for long periods\n\nNotably, high heart rate or tachycardia greatly increases ischemia (low oxygen to the heart) caused by myocardial bridges.

Thus as the heart rate increases, the time the artery has to reopen (diastolic period) decreases dramatically - to the point that with very high heart rates, the artery never fully reopens and blood flow is constantly reduced.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nThere are three key tests currently used to diagnose myocardial bridges by Stanford University: CT scan, cardiac catheterization, and stress ultrasound.\n#CT scan - on which the myocardial bridge often appears as a compressed or squashed area of the artery in which, notably, the fatty areas surrounding the artery (shown in black on CT scans) disappear, since the artery is tunneling through muscle not fat in this area. CTs often allow an assessment of an approximate length and depth of the myocardial bridge, but compression cannot be assessed accurately from a CT scan.<ref>Myocardial Bridges on Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography-- Correlation with Intravascular Ultrasound and Fractional Flow Reserve.

It is critical to note that in order to be meaningful in diagnosing a myocardial bridge, it is critical to measure dFFR i.e. the diastolic period, not mean FFR. This is because, contrary to a common misconception, myocardial bridges cause compression of the artery during diastole as well as systole, as explained above.

Stanford's center for myocardial bridges has offered second opinion services from a distance for some ten years, including to numerous international patients.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nNotably, EKG is not a reliable or conclusive diagnostic tool for diagnosing MBs. Some symptomatic MB patients show normal EKG results and others abnormal.\n\nMany doctors have suggested that there is a need for more awareness of MBs among doctors and better testing, including testing of young people as the disease is congenital. According to a 2007 study by Ripa et al.: <br>\n\"Clinical suspicion of a myocardial bridge would be warranted in all cases of typical or atypical chest pain in subjects who have a low probability of atherosclerosis because they are free from the traditional cardiovascular risk factors, particularly in the young.\"<ref name=\"Ripa et al 2007\"/>\n\nIn a 2017 article in Stanford Medical Center's official blog Scope, Dr. Ingela Schnittger stated:<br>\n\"Many of these patients have these heartbreaking stories to tell.

Unroofing surgery today is done via open heart (sternum), thoracotomy (through the ribs), and also using robot-assisted surgery (through tiny keyholes in the chest). Full open heart surgery is usually reserved for very large myocardial bridges and/or specific situations which make thoracotomy difficult. By far, Stanford University has done more unroofing surgeries than any other hospital in the world, with over 200 unroofings completed since starting a decade ago. In 2019, University of Chicago surgeon Dr. Husam Balkhy emerged as a provider of robotic-assisted unroofing surgery, with some patients being possible candidates for this route.<ref>Robotic totally endoscopic off-pump unroofing of left anterior descending coronary artery myocardial bridge: A report of two cases.

Stanford University Medical Center's 2016 study by Pargaonkar et al.<ref>Pargaonkar et al. Effect of Surgical Unroofing of a Myocardial Bridge on Exercise Induced QT interval Dispersion and Anginal Symptoms in Patients with Angina in the Absence of Obstructive Coronary Artery Disease. Journal of the American College of Cardiology</ref> showed that unroofing surgery \u201csignificantly improves anginal symptoms\u201d and improves \u201call five dimensions of the SAQ\u201d i.e. Seattle Angina Questionnaire. Some residual symptoms caused by complications from a lifetime of living with a myocardial bridge may continue after unroofing surgery such as endothelial dysfunction, vasospasm, plaque, narrowed artery. However, these often improve slowly over a year or more once the myocardial bridge is gone.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nA few cases have occurred in various hospitals in which patients have not been completely unroofed, leaving segments of the MB, resulting in lingering symptoms.\n\nA critical point is that the endothelial dysfunction and vasospasms caused by myocardial bridges cannot start to heal until unroofing surgery is done, because the MB continues to squeeze on the artery, damaging the artery lining.\n\nBypass surgery is not the first line treatment for myocardial bridges for two main reasons:<ref name =\"Stanford Overview 2017\" />\n#Competitive flow problem - blood can flow the wrong way i.e. continue to flow down the original artery instead of the new artery that has been grafted on.\n#Jailed septal arteries still jailed - a jailed artery is a septal artery (a branch off the coronary artery) which lies inside the myocardial bridge and is thus also compressed with each heartbeat. Septal arteries are critical as they carry blood into the heart septum. Bypass surgery alone does not remedy jailed septal arteries, which still do not get blood flow.\n\nNotably, many myocardial bridge patients have had bypass surgery only to later need unroofing surgery after the bypass proved unsuccessful.<ref name =\"Stanford Overview 2017\" />\n\nHowever, papers by Ekeke et al., 2015 <ref>Myocardial bridging over the left anterior descending: Myotomy, bypass, or both?\nEkeke et al. 2015. Journal of Thoracic Cardiovascular Surgery.</ref> and others have shown bypass surgery is helpful as an addition to supplement unroofing surgery, but only when there is significant plaque just before (proximal to) the myocardial bridge or anatomic anomalies increase the risk of recurrence of such plaque.\n\nA 2013 Russian study by Bockeria et al.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bockeria |first1=Leo A. |last2=Sukhanov |first2=Sergey G. |last3=Orekhova |first3=Ekaterina N. |last4=Shatakhyan |first4=Mesrop P. |last5=Korotayev |first5=Dmitry A. |last6=Sternik |first6=Leonid |title=Results of Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting in Myocardial Bridging of Left Anterior Descending Artery |journal=Journal of Cardiac Surgery |date=May 2013 |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=218\u2013221 |doi=10.1111/jocs.12101 |pmid=23574298 }}</ref> concludes that this competitive flow problem is much more likely to occur if the LIMA artery is used for the graft rather than the SVG, so the SVG is recommended.\n\nStents are never indicated as a treatment for myocardial bridges because trials have shown they are prone to breaking when the artery is squeezed each heartbeat.<ref name =\"Stanford Overview 2017\" />\n\nUnroofing surgery has been performed in the United States, Belgium, Spain, Italy, England, China, Russia, United Arab Emirates among other countries.

But a great deal of science has emerged in the past decade to clarify the condition. In particular, Stanford has published over 15 articles on MBs since 2014. One commonly recurring reason for denial of treatment is the idea that myocardial bridges do not significantly affect blood flow. But this myth has been debunked by Stanford and also Daoud and Wafa 2012 who say:\n\n{{quote|Normally, only 15% of coronary blood flow occurs during systole and because myocardial bridging is a systolic event on angiography, its clinical significance and relevance have been questioned. [However] angiographic and intravascular ultrasonographic studies demonstrated that vessel compression during systole is followed by the delay in the increase in luminal diameter during diastole, thus affecting the predominant phase of coronary perfusion, especially during episodes of tachycardia. These data suggest that angina, acute coronary syndromes, and arrhythmias in patients with myocardial bridging may be explained by the reduced ischemic threshold.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Daoud |first1=Eid M. |last2=Wafa |first2=Ahmed A. |title=Does isolated myocardial bridge really interfere with coronary blood flow? |journal=The Egyptian Heart Journal |date=June 2013 |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=65\u201370 |doi=10.1016/j.ehj.2012.05.003 }}</ref>\n}}\n\nIn other words, while the myocardial bridge itself only compresses the artery while the heart squeezes (systolic period), which is only 15% of the time in the heartbeat cycle, in fact the artery stays compressed long after the heart relaxes. This is because arteries are sturdy and pliable, so after being compressed they are very slow to reopen, remaining in some level of semi-compression for most if not all of the diastolic period i.e. the other 85% of the heartbeat cycle (hence the critical need for dFFR testing in diagnosing myocardial bridges). Thus the coronary artery is fully open to allow normal blood flow for only a small percentage of each heartbeat cycle. This problem is further exacerbated by tachycardia (high heart rate), which can bring the duration of normal blood flow to zero, as explained below. Dr. Ingela Schnittger, head of the Myocardial Bridge Research Center at Stanford, has appeared on BBC Radio to explain this.\n\n==Patient Success Stories==\n\n\u2018I have my life back\u2019: Kathy Hoseth battled inexplicable chest pains much of her life\u2014until she finally found the cardiothoracic surgeon who could remedy her condition.<br>\nby Zinta Aistars<br>\nSpectrum Health Beat, September 2019<br>\nhttps://healthbeat.spectrumhealth.org/sharp-lifelong-chest-pain-myocardial-bridge-surgery-women-cardiac-disparities/?hootPostID=43ea49e6229634fc9c07a04f4d036b59\n\nTreating an Overlooked Condition<br>\nby Samantha Beal<br>\nStanford Children's Health, February 22, 2017<br>\nhttps://healthier.stanfordchildrens.org/en/treating-an-overlooked-heart-condition/\n\nAbu Dhabi surgeons complete Middle East's first robotic surgery for rare heart condition<br>\nCleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, December 13, 2017<br>\nhttps://www.clevelandclinicabudhabi.ae/en/media-center/news/pages/abu-dhabi-surgeons-complete-middle-easts-first-robotic-surgery-for-rare-heart-condition.aspx\n\nWhy Does Kyle Watson Keep Running?

Thus as the heart rate increases, the time the artery has to reopen (diastolic period) decreases dramatically - to the point that with very high heart rates, the artery never fully reopens and blood flow is constantly reduced.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nThere are three key tests currently used to diagnose myocardial bridges by Stanford University: CT scan, cardiac catheterization, and stress ultrasound.\n#CT scan - on which the myocardial bridge often appears as a compressed or squashed area of the artery in which, notably, the fatty areas surrounding the artery (shown in black on CT scans) disappear, since the artery is tunneling through muscle not fat in this area. CTs often allow an assessment of an approximate length and depth of the myocardial bridge, but compression cannot be assessed accurately from a CT scan.<ref>Myocardial Bridges on Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography-- Correlation with Intravascular Ultrasound and Fractional Flow Reserve.

It is critical to note that in order to be meaningful in diagnosing a myocardial bridge, it is critical to measure dFFR i.e. the diastolic period, not mean FFR. This is because, contrary to a common misconception, myocardial bridges cause compression of the artery during diastole as well as systole, as explained above.

Some symptomatic MB patients show normal EKG results and others abnormal.\n\nMany doctors have suggested that there is a need for more awareness of MBs among doctors and better testing, including testing of young people as the disease is congenital.

Unroofing surgery today is done via open heart (sternum), thoracotomy (through the ribs), and also using robot-assisted surgery (through tiny keyholes in the chest). Full open heart surgery is usually reserved for very large myocardial bridges and/or specific situations which make thoracotomy difficult. By far, Stanford University has done more unroofing surgeries than any other hospital in the world, with over 200 unroofings completed since starting a decade ago. In 2019, University of Chicago surgeon Dr. Husam Balkhy emerged as a provider of robotic-assisted unroofing surgery, with some patients being possible candidates for this route.<ref>Robotic totally endoscopic off-pump unroofing of left anterior descending coronary artery myocardial bridge: A report of two cases.

Stanford University Medical Center's 2016 study by Pargaonkar et al.<ref>Pargaonkar et al. Effect of Surgical Unroofing of a Myocardial Bridge on Exercise Induced QT interval Dispersion and Anginal Symptoms in Patients with Angina in the Absence of Obstructive Coronary Artery Disease. Journal of the American College of Cardiology</ref> showed that unroofing surgery \u201csignificantly improves anginal symptoms\u201d and improves \u201call five dimensions of the SAQ\u201d i.e. Seattle Angina Questionnaire. Some residual symptoms caused by complications from a lifetime of living with a myocardial bridge may continue after unroofing surgery such as endothelial dysfunction, vasospasm, plaque, narrowed artery. However, these often improve slowly over a year or more once the myocardial bridge is gone.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nA few cases have occurred in various hospitals in which patients have not been completely unroofed, leaving segments of the MB, resulting in lingering symptoms.\n\nA critical point is that the endothelial dysfunction and vasospasms caused by myocardial bridges cannot start to heal until unroofing surgery is done, because the MB continues to squeeze on the artery, damaging the artery lining.\n\nBypass surgery is not the first line treatment for myocardial bridges for two main reasons:<ref name =\"Stanford Overview 2017\" />\n#Competitive flow problem - blood can flow the wrong way i.e. continue to flow down the original artery instead of the new artery that has been grafted on.\n#Jailed septal arteries still jailed - a jailed artery is a septal artery (a branch off the coronary artery) which lies inside the myocardial bridge and is thus also compressed with each heartbeat. Septal arteries are critical as they carry blood into the heart septum. Bypass surgery alone does not remedy jailed septal arteries, which still do not get blood flow.\n\nNotably, many myocardial bridge patients have had bypass surgery only to later need unroofing surgery after the bypass proved unsuccessful.<ref name =\"Stanford Overview 2017\" />\n\nHowever, papers by Ekeke et al, 2015 <ref>Myocardial bridging over the left anterior descending: Myotomy, bypass, or both?\nEkeke et al. 2015. Journal of Thoracic Cardiovascular Surgery.</ref> and others have shown bypass surgery is helpful as an addition to supplement unroofing surgery, but only when there is significant plaque just before (proximal to) the myocardial bridge or anatomic anomalies increase the risk of recurrence of such plaque.\n\nA 2013 Russian study by Bockeria et al<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bockeria |first1=Leo A. |last2=Sukhanov |first2=Sergey G. |last3=Orekhova |first3=Ekaterina N. |last4=Shatakhyan |first4=Mesrop P. |last5=Korotayev |first5=Dmitry A. |last6=Sternik |first6=Leonid |title=Results of Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting in Myocardial Bridging of Left Anterior Descending Artery |journal=Journal of Cardiac Surgery |date=May 2013 |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=218\u2013221 |doi=10.1111/jocs.12101 |pmid=23574298 }}</ref> concludes that this competitive flow problem is much more likely to occur if the LIMA artery is used for the graft rather than the SVG, so the SVG is recommended.\n\nStents are never indicated as a treatment for myocardial bridges because trials have shown they are prone to breaking when the artery is squeezed each heartbeat.<ref name =\"Stanford Overview 2017\" />\n\nUnroofing surgery has been performed in the United States, Belgium, Spain, Italy, England, China, Russia, United Arab Emirates among other countries.

But a great deal of science has emerged in the past decade to clarify the condition. In particular, Stanford has published over 15 articles on MBs since 2014. One commonly recurring reason for denial of treatment is the idea that myocardial bridges do not significantly affect blood flow. But this myth has been debunked by Stanford and also Daoud and Wafa 2012 who say:\n\n{{quote|Normally, only 15% of coronary blood flow occurs during systole and because myocardial bridging is a systolic event on angiography, its clinical significance and relevance have been questioned. [However] angiographic and intravascular ultrasonographic studies demonstrated that vessel compression during systole is followed by the delay in the increase in luminal diameter during diastole, thus affecting the predominant phase of coronary perfusion, especially during episodes of tachycardia. These data suggest that angina, acute coronary syndromes, and arrhythmias in patients with myocardial bridging may be explained by the reduced ischemic threshold.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Daoud |first1=Eid M. |last2=Wafa |first2=Ahmed A. |title=Does isolated myocardial bridge really interfere with coronary blood flow? |journal=The Egyptian Heart Journal |date=June 2013 |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=65\u201370 |doi=10.1016/j.ehj.2012.05.003 }}</ref>\n}}\n\nIn other words, while the myocardial bridge itself only compresses the artery while the heart squeezes (systolic period), which is only 15% of the time in the heartbeat cycle, in fact the artery stays compressed long after the heart relaxes. This is because arteries are sturdy and pliable, so after being compressed they are very slow to reopen, remaining in some level of semi-compression for most if not all of the diastolic period i.e. the other 85% of the heartbeat cycle (hence the critical need for dFFR testing in diagnosing myocardial bridges). Thus the coronary artery is fully open to allow normal blood flow for only a small percentage of each heartbeat cycle. This problem is further exacerbated by tachycardia (high heart rate), which can bring the duration of normal blood flow to zero, as explained below. Dr. Ingela Schnittger, head of the Myocardial Bridge Research Center at Stanford, has appeared on BBC Radio to explain this.\n\n==Patient Success Stories==\n\n\u2018I have my life back\u2019: Kathy Hoseth battled inexplicable chest pains much of her life\u2014until she finally found the cardiothoracic surgeon who could remedy her condition.<br>\nby Zinta Aistars<br>\nSpectrum Health Beat, September 2019<br>\nhttps://healthbeat.spectrumhealth.org/sharp-lifelong-chest-pain-myocardial-bridge-surgery-women-cardiac-disparities/?hootPostID=43ea49e6229634fc9c07a04f4d036b59\n\nTreating an Overlooked Condition<br>\nby Samantha Beal<br>\nStanford Children's Health, February 22, 2017<br>\nhttps://healthier.stanfordchildrens.org/en/treating-an-overlooked-heart-condition/\n\nAbu Dhabi surgeons complete Middle East\u2019s first robotic surgery for rare heart condition<br>\nCleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, December 13, 2017<br>\nhttps://www.clevelandclinicabudhabi.ae/en/media-center/news/pages/abu-dhabi-surgeons-complete-middle-easts-first-robotic-surgery-for-rare-heart-condition.aspx\n\nWhy Does Kyle Watson Keep Running?
