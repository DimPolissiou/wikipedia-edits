She has nowhere to go. Meadow and Noah go to his room instead and she gives him her virginity. They try to help Caitlin; Meadow admires Noah's sensitivity. They take her out on her birthday: an encounter with a deranged homeless woman upsets her again. When Meadow is away, Caitlin persuades Noah to let her hang out in his room. She distracts him while he is working and he is furious and ashamed at the grade he gets: \"C-fucking-minus and it's all her fault!\" Meadow nervously meets Noah's father and in, reply to his question, says her father is in waste management. She is taken aback when Noah tells her his father has taken out a [[injunction|restraining order]] against Caitlin. Then, when they are together working in the library, Noah looks up and quietly tells Meadow he is breaking up with her because of her cynical, negative attitude. She is baffled and shocked but, in the library, controls her emotions. \n\nAt the bar at the [[Bada Bing]], [[Tony Soprano|Tony]] is approached by one of the pole dancers, [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Tracee|Tracee]]. She reminds him that he gave her some advice about her sick son, and to thank him gives him some [[Date palm#Fruits|date nut bread]] she has made. Tony explains that this is out of place; also, she is [[Ralph Cifaretto|Ralphie]]'s girl. When she has gone, he pushes the bread off the bar into a bin. Tracee still finds pretexts to speak to him. She tells him she is pregnant by Ralphie and asks for advice; Tony says that for the sake of future generations, she should not have Ralphie's child.\n\nRalphie's manic jokes offend the other mobsters. He is obsessed with the film ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'', and roughhouses with [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Georgie Santorelli|Georgie]]. Things become tense when he finds a length of chain and swings it at Georgie, injuring his eye. \n\nTracee misses work for three days, claiming to be sick, and stays at home with Ralphie. [[Silvio Dante|Silvio]] goes there, drags her out, and throws her into his car while Ralphie watches at a window, laughing. She next sees Ralphie three days later at the club; he hasn't been in touch and she insults him in front of the other men. Out in the carpark he soothes her and she tells him she loves him. Then he changes, and speaks of the daughter they will have, a whore like her mother. She slaps him; he laughs and she slaps harder. He knocks her down to the ground, then bashes her head against a metal guardrail until she is dead. Tony is furious and, in violation of [[American Mafia|Mafia]] code, assaults Ralphie, a [[made man]].\n\nHe speaks obliquely about the event to [[Jennifer Melfi|Dr. Melfi]]. \"Sad when they go so young,\" he says.\n\n==Deceased==\n*'''[[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Tracee|Tracee]]''': Bada Bing stripper murdered by Ralphie in the parking lot.\n\n==Title reference==\n* Much of the episode revolves around Meadow's university experiences.\n\n==Other cultural references==\n* In the first scene, Silvio points to \"[[Yo Yo Ma]]\" as evidence that the Chinese, like his fellow Italians, also have \"nicknames.\"\n* After being introduced to Meadow, Noah's father says he sat next to a talkative [[Tim Daly]] of ''[[Wings (NBC TV series)|Wings]]'' fame on his flight from [[Los Angeles]]. Noah also mentions that his father did Daly's deal for the short-lived TV series remake of ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)#2000 revival series|The Fugitive]]''.  Daly would later play the role of television writer J.T. Dolan on ''The Sopranos'', beginning with the episode \"[[In Camelot]].\"\n* Caitlin references the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]] while expressing to Meadow how she was worried about her missing.\n* During a scene in the family kitchen, A.J. wears a [[Nine Inch Nails]] [[Fragility Tour|Fragility tour]] T-shirt.\n* After dining out with Noah's father, Noah and Meadow see the [[Francis Ford Coppola]] film ''[[Dementia 13]]''.\n* Ralph watches [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'', starring [[Kirk Douglas]], which Christopher recommended as a good gladiator film.\n\n==Music==\n* The song played during Tracee's introduction and during the end credits is \"Living on a Thin Line\", from [[The Kinks]] 1984 album, ''[[Word of Mouth (The Kinks album)|Word of Mouth]]''.\n* The song playing in the background during the first scene between Noah and Meadow is \"[[The Dolphin's Cry]]\" by [[Live (band)|Live]].\n* When the stripper (Kelly Kole) is trying to get into the VIP room of the Bada Bing, \"[[You Shook Me All Night Long]]\" by [[AC/DC]] is playing in the background.\n* The song playing when Tracee shows Tony her new braces is [[Minnie Riperton]]'s \"Inside My Love\" (1975).\n* The song playing when Silvio is informed that Tracee had missed three days of work is \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\" by [[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive]].   \n* The song playing in the background when Meadow and Noah have dinner with Noah's father is \"Everybody's Jumpin\" by [[The Dave Brubeck Quartet]].\n* \"[[Powder Your Face with Sunshine]]\" by [[Dean Martin]] is used in a scene at the Bada Bing, where Ralph is telling the Custer joke.\n\n==Aftermath==\nAccording to actress [[Ariel Kiley]], who plays Tracee, the stripper murdered by Ralph Cifaretto, a lot of subscribers canceled their HBO service because of the episode.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uvm.edu/theview/article.php?id=1399 |title= Hollywood Holdout |last=Reidel|first=Jon |publisher=The View (University of Vermont) |date=October 18, 2004|accessdate=2009-11-21|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215070314/http://www.uvm.edu/theview/article.php?id=1399|archivedate=2007-12-15}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.hbo.com/the-sopranos/episodes/3/32-university/index.html \"University\"] at [[HBO]]\n*{{imdb episode|0705291|University}}\n*{{tv.com episode|the-sopranos/university-46365|University}}\n\n{{Sopranos}}\n\n[[Category:The Sopranos (season 3) episodes]]\n[[Category:2001 American television episodes]]\n", "text_old": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:University (''The Sopranos'')}}\n{{Infobox television episode\n| title = University\n| series = [[The Sopranos]]\n| season = 3\n| episode = 6\n| guests= ''see below''\n| airdate = April 1, 2001\n| length = 49 minutes\n| production = 306\n| teleplay = {{Unbulleted list|[[Terence Winter]]|Salvatore J.

She has nowhere to go. Meadow and Noah go to his room instead and she gives him her virginity. They try to help Caitlin; Meadow admires Noah's sensitivity. They take her out on her birthday: an encounter with a deranged homeless woman upsets her again. When Meadow is away, Caitlin persuades Noah to let her hang out in his room. She distracts him while he is working and he is furious and ashamed at the grade he gets: \"C-fucking-minus and it's all her fault!\" Meadow nervously meets Noah's father and in, reply to his question, says her father is in waste management. She is taken aback when Noah tells her his father has taken out a [[injunction|restraining order]] against Caitlin. Then, when they are together working in the library, Noah looks up and quietly tells Meadow he is breaking up with her because of her cynical, negative attitude. She is baffled and shocked but, in the library, controls her emotions. \n\nAt the bar at the [[Bada Bing]], [[Tony Soprano|Tony]] is approached by one of the pole dancers, [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Tracee|Tracee]]. She reminds him that he gave her some advice about her sick son, and to thank him gives him some [[Date palm#Fruits|date nut bread]] she has made. Tony explains that this is out of place; also, she is [[Ralph Cifaretto|Ralphie]]'s girl. When she has gone, he pushes the bread off the bar into a bin. Tracee still finds pretexts to speak to him. She tells him she is pregnant by Ralphie and asks for advice; Tony says that for the sake of future generations, she should not have Ralphie's child.\n\nRalphie's manic jokes offend the other mobsters. He is obsessed with the film ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'', and roughhouses with [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Georgie Santorelli|Georgie]]. Things become tense when he finds a length of chain and swings it at Georgie, injuring his eye. \n\nTracee misses work for three days, claiming to be sick, and stays at home with Ralphie. [[Silvio Dante|Silvio]] goes there, drags her out, and throws her into his car while Ralphie watches at a window, laughing. She next sees Ralphie three days later at the club; he hasn't been in touch and she insults him in front of the other men. Out in the carpark he soothes her and she tells him she loves him. Then he changes, and speaks of the daughter they will have, a whore like her mother. She slaps him; he laughs and she slaps harder. He knocks her down to the ground, then bashes her head against a metal guardrail until she is dead. Tony is furious and, in violation of [[American Mafia|Mafia]] code, assaults Ralphie, a [[made man]].\n\nHe speaks obliquely about the event to [[Jennifer Melfi|Dr. Melfi]]. \"Sad when they go so young,\" he says.\n\n==Deceased==\n*'''[[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Tracee|Tracee]]''': Bada Bing stripper murdered by Ralphie in the parking lot.\n\n==Title reference==\n* Much of the episode revolves around Meadow's university experiences.\n\n==Other cultural references==\n* In the first scene, Silvio points to \"[[Yo Yo Ma]]\" as evidence that the Chinese, like his fellow Italians, also have \"nicknames.\"\n* After being introduced to Meadow, Noah's father says he sat next to a talkative [[Tim Daly]] of ''[[Wings (NBC TV series)|Wings]]'' fame on his flight from [[Los Angeles]]. Noah also mentions that his father did Daly's deal for the short-lived TV series remake of ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)#2000 revival series|The Fugitive]]''.  Daly would later play the role of television writer J.T. Dolan on ''The Sopranos'', beginning with the episode \"[[In Camelot]].\"\n* Caitlin references the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]] while expressing to Meadow how she was worried about her missing.\n* During a scene in the family kitchen, A.J. wears a [[Nine Inch Nails]] [[Fragility Tour|Fragility tour]] T-shirt.\n* After dining out with Noah's father, Noah and Meadow see the [[Francis Ford Coppola]] film ''[[Dementia 13]]''.\n* Ralph watches [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'', starring [[Kirk Douglas]], which Christopher recommended as a good gladiator film.\n\n==Music==\n* The song played during Tracee's introduction and during the end credits is \"Living on a Thin Line\", from [[The Kinks]] 1984 album, ''[[Word of Mouth (The Kinks album)|Word of Mouth]]''.\n* The song playing in the background during the first scene between Noah and Meadow is \"[[The Dolphin's Cry]]\" by [[Live (band)|Live]].\n* When the stripper (Kelly Kole) is trying to get into the VIP room of the Bada Bing, \"[[You Shook Me All Night Long]]\" by [[AC/DC]] is playing in the background.\n* The song playing when Tracee shows Tony her new braces is [[Minnie Riperton]]'s \"Inside My Love\" (1975).\n* The song playing when Silvio is informed that Tracee had missed three days of work is \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\" by [[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive]].   \n* The song playing in the background when Meadow and Noah have dinner with Noah's father is \"Everybody's Jumpin\" by [[The Dave Brubeck Quartet]].\n* \"[[Powder Your Face with Sunshine]]\" by [[Dean Martin]] is used in a scene at the Bada Bing, where Ralph is telling the Custer joke.\n\n==Aftermath==\nAccording to actress [[Ariel Kiley]], who plays Tracee, the stripper murdered by Ralph Cifaretto, a lot of subscribers canceled their HBO service because of the episode.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uvm.edu/theview/article.php?id=1399 |title= Hollywood Holdout |last=Reidel|first=Jon |publisher=The View (University of Vermont) |date=October 18, 2004|accessdate=2009-11-21|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215070314/http://www.uvm.edu/theview/article.php?id=1399|archivedate=2007-12-15}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.hbo.com/the-sopranos/episodes/3/32-university/index.html \"University\"] at [[HBO]]\n*{{imdb episode|0705291|University}}\n*{{tv.com episode|the-sopranos/university-46365|University}}\n\n{{Sopranos}}\n\n[[Category:The Sopranos (season 3) episodes]]\n[[Category:2001 American television episodes]]\n", "name_user": "Fullmetal2887", "label": "safe", "comment": "image caption", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_(The_Sopranos)"}

An [[industrial robot]] is a prime example of a mechatronics system; it includes aspects of electronics, mechanics, and computing to do its day-to-day jobs.\n\n[[Engineering cybernetics]] deals with the question of control [[engineering]] of mechatronic systems. It is used to control or regulate such a system (see [[control theory]]). Through collaboration, the mechatronic modules perform the production goals and inherit flexible and agile manufacturing properties in the production scheme. Modern production equipment consists of mechatronic modules that are integrated according to a control architecture. The most known architectures involve [[hierarchy]], [[polyarchy]], [[heterarchy]], and hybrid. The methods for achieving a technical effect are described by control [[algorithm]]s, which might or might not utilize [[formal method]]s in their design. Hybrid systems important to mechatronics include [[Operations management#Production systems|production systems]], synergy drives,\n[[Mars Exploration Rover|planetary exploration rovers]], automotive subsystems such as [[anti-lock braking system]]s and spin-assist, and everyday equipment such as autofocus cameras, video, [[hard disk]]s, and CD players.\n\n==Course structure==\nMechatronics students take courses in various fields:\n\n*[[Mechanical engineering]] and [[materials science and engineering]]\n*[[Electronics engineering]]\n*[[Electrical engineering]]\n*[[Computer engineering]] (software & hardware engineering)\n*[[Computer science]]\n*[[Systems engineering]] \n*[[Control engineering]]\n*[[Optical engineering]]\n*[[Telecommunications]]\n\n==Applications==\n* [[Machine vision]]\n* [[Automation]] and [[robotics]]\n* [[servomechanism|Servo-mechanics]]\n* [[sensor|Sensing]] and [[control system]]s\n* [[Automotive engineering]], automotive equipment in the design of subsystems such as [[anti-lock braking system]]s\n* [[Building automation]] / [[Home automation]]\n* Computer-machine controls, such as computer driven machines like CNC milling machines, CNC waterjets, and CNC plasma cutters\n* Expert systems\n* Industrial goods\n* Consumer products\n* Mechatronics systems\n* Medical mechatronics, medical imaging systems\n* Structural dynamic systems\n* Transportation and vehicular systems\n* Mechatronics as the new language of the automobile\n* Computer aided and integrated manufacturing systems\n* [[Computer aided design|Computer-aided design]]\n* Engineering and manufacturing systems\n* Packaging\n* Microcontrollers / PLCs\n\n==Physical implementations==\nMechanical modeling calls for modeling and simulating physical complex phenomena in the scope of a multi-scale and multi-physical approach. This implies to implement and to manage modeling and optimization methods and tools, which are integrated in a systemic approach.\nThe specialty is aimed for students in mechanics who want to open their mind to systems engineering, and able to integrate different physics or technologies, as well as students in mechatronics who want to increase their knowledge in optimization and multidisciplinary simulation techniques.\nThe speciality educates students in robust and/or optimized conception methods for structures or many technological systems, and to the main modeling and simulation tools used in R&D. Special courses are also proposed for original applications (multi-materials composites, innovating transducers and [[actuator]]s, integrated systems, \u2026) to prepare the students to the coming breakthrough in the domains covering the materials and the systems.\nFor some mechatronic systems, the main issue is no longer how to implement a control system, but how to implement actuators. Within the mechatronic field, mainly two technologies are used to produce movement/motion.\n\n==Variant of the field==\nAn emerging variant of this field is [[biomechatronics]], whose purpose is to integrate mechanical parts with a human being, usually in the form of removable gadgets such as an [[exoskeleton]]. This is the \"real-life\" version of [[cyberware]].\n\nAnother variant that we can consider is Motion control for Advanced Mechatronics, which presently is recognized as a key technology in mechatronics. The robustness of motion control will be represented as a function of stiffness and a basis for practical realization. Target of motion is parameterized by control stiffness which could be variable according to the task reference. However, the system robustness of motion always requires very high stiffness in the controller.<ref>[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=491410 \u2033Motion Control and Advanced Mechatronics\u2033].</ref>\n\n[[Avionics]] is also considered a variant of mechatronics as it combines several fields such as [[Electronic engineering|electronics]] and telecom with [[Aerospace engineering]].\n\n==Internet of things==\nThe [[Internet of things]] (IoT) is the [[Internetworking|inter-networking]] of physical devices, [[Embedded system|embedded]] with [[electronics]], [[software]], [[sensor]]s, [[actuator]]s, and [[Internet access|network connectivity]] which enable these objects to collect and exchange [[data]].\n\nIoT and mechatronics are complementary. Many of the smart components associated with the Internet of Things will be essentially mechatronic. The development of the IoT is forcing mechatronics engineers, designers, practitioners and educators to research the ways in which mechatronic systems and components are perceived, designed and manufactured. This allows them to face up to new issues such as data security, machine ethics and the human-machine interface.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bradley|first1=David|last2=Russell|first2=David|last3=Ferguson|first3=Ian|title=The Internet of Things-The future or the end of mechatronics|journal=Mechatronics|volume=27|pages=57\u201374|date=March 2015|doi=10.1016/j.mechatronics.2015.02.005}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics}} \n* [[Cybernetics]]\n* [[Control theory]]\n* [[Ecomechatronics]]\n* [[Electromechanics]]\n* [[Materials engineering]] \n* [[Mechanical engineering technology]]\n* [[Robotics]] \n* [[Systems engineering]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Bradley, Dawson et al., ''Mechatronics, Electronics in products and processes'', Chapman and Hall Verlag, [[London]], 1991.\n* Karnopp, Dean C., Donald L.

An [[industrial robot]] is a prime example of a mechatronics system; it includes aspects of electronics, mechanics, and computing to do its day-to-day jobs.\n\n[[Engineering cybernetics]] deals with the question of control [[engineering]] of mechatronic systems. It is used to control or regulate such a system (see [[control theory]]). Through collaboration, the mechatronic modules perform the production goals and inherit flexible and agile manufacturing properties in the production scheme. Modern production equipment consists of mechatronic modules that are integrated according to a control architecture. The most known architectures involve [[hierarchy]], [[polyarchy]], [[heterarchy]], and hybrid. The methods for achieving a technical effect are described by control [[algorithm]]s, which might or might not utilize [[formal method]]s in their design. Hybrid systems important to mechatronics include [[Operations management#Production systems|production systems]], synergy drives,\n[[Mars Exploration Rover|planetary exploration rovers]], automotive subsystems such as [[anti-lock braking system]]s and spin-assist, and everyday equipment such as autofocus cameras, video, [[hard disk]]s, and CD players.\n\n==Course structure==\nMechatronics students take courses in various fields:\n\n*[[Mechanical engineering]] and [[materials science and engineering]]\n*[[Electronics engineering]]\n*[[Electrical engineering]]\n*[[Computer engineering]] (software & hardware engineering)\n*[[Computer science]]\n*[[Systems engineering]] \n*[[Control engineering]]\n*[[Optical engineering]]\n*[[Telecommunications]]\n\n==Applications==\n* [[Machine vision]]\n* [[Automation]] and [[robotics]]\n* [[servomechanism|Servo-mechanics]]\n* [[sensor|Sensing]] and [[control system]]s\n* [[Automotive engineering]], automotive equipment in the design of subsystems such as [[anti-lock braking system]]s\n* [[Building automation]] / [[Home automation]]\n* Computer-machine controls, such as computer driven machines like CNC milling machines, CNC waterjets, and CNC plasma cutters\n* Expert systems\n* Industrial goods\n* Consumer products\n* Mechatronics systems\n* Medical mechatronics, medical imaging systems\n* Structural dynamic systems\n* Transportation and vehicular systems\n* Mechatronics as the new language of the automobile\n* Computer aided and integrated manufacturing systems\n* [[Computer aided design|Computer-aided design]]\n* Engineering and manufacturing systems\n* Packaging\n* Microcontrollers / PLCs\n\n==Physical implementations==\nMechanical modeling calls for modeling and simulating physical complex phenomena in the scope of a multi-scale and multi-physical approach. This implies to implement and to manage modeling and optimization methods and tools, which are integrated in a systemic approach.\nThe specialty is aimed for students in mechanics who want to open their mind to systems engineering, and able to integrate different physics or technologies, as well as students in mechatronics who want to increase their knowledge in optimization and multidisciplinary simulation techniques.\nThe speciality educates students in robust and/or optimized conception methods for structures or many technological systems, and to the main modeling and simulation tools used in R&D. Special courses are also proposed for original applications (multi-materials composites, innovating transducers and [[actuator]]s, integrated systems, \u2026) to prepare the students to the coming breakthrough in the domains covering the materials and the systems.\nFor some mechatronic systems, the main issue is no longer how to implement a control system, but how to implement actuators. Within the mechatronic field, mainly two technologies are used to produce movement/motion.\n\n==Variant of the field==\nAn emerging variant of this field is [[biomechatronics]], whose purpose is to integrate mechanical parts with a human being, usually in the form of removable gadgets such as an [[exoskeleton]]. This is the \"real-life\" version of [[cyberware]].\n\nAnother variant that we can consider is Motion control for Advanced Mechatronics, which presently is recognized as a key technology in mechatronics. The robustness of motion control will be represented as a function of stiffness and a basis for practical realization. Target of motion is parameterized by control stiffness which could be variable according to the task reference. However, the system robustness of motion always requires very high stiffness in the controller.<ref>[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=491410 \u2033Motion Control and Advanced Mechatronics\u2033].</ref>\n\n[[Avionics]] is also considered a variant of mechatronics as it combines several fields such as [[Electronic engineering|electronics]] and telecom with [[Aerospace engineering]].\n\n==Internet of things==\nThe [[Internet of things]] (IoT) is the [[Internetworking|inter-networking]] of physical devices, [[Embedded system|embedded]] with [[electronics]], [[software]], [[sensor]]s, [[actuator]]s, and [[Internet access|network connectivity]] which enable these objects to collect and exchange [[data]].\n\nIoT and mechatronics are complementary. Many of the smart components associated with the Internet of Things will be essentially mechatronic. The development of the IoT is forcing mechatronics engineers, designers, practitioners and educators to research the ways in which mechatronic systems and components are perceived, designed and manufactured. This allows them to face up to new issues such as data security, machine ethics and the human-machine interface.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bradley|first1=David|last2=Russell|first2=David|last3=Ferguson|first3=Ian|title=The Internet of Things-The future or the end of mechatronics|journal=Mechatronics|volume=27|pages=57\u201374|date=March 2015|doi=10.1016/j.mechatronics.2015.02.005}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics}} \n* [[Cybernetics]]\n* [[Control theory]]\n* [[Ecomechatronics]]\n* [[Electromechanics]]\n* [[Materials engineering]] \n* [[Mechanical engineering technology]]\n* [[Robotics]] \n* [[Systems engineering]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Bradley, Dawson et al., ''Mechatronics, Electronics in products and processes'', Chapman and Hall Verlag, [[London]], 1991.\n* Karnopp, Dean C., Donald L.

It was formed by [[Chino Moreno]] (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), [[Stephen Carpenter]] (lead guitar), [[Abe Cunningham]] (drums) and Dominic Garcia (bass). During their first five years, the band's lineup changed several times, but stabilized in 1993 when Cunningham rejoined after his departure in 1990; by this time, [[Chi Cheng (musician)|Chi Cheng]] was bassist. The lineup remained stable for fifteen years, with the exception of keyboardist and turntablist [[Frank Delgado (American musician)|Frank Delgado]] being added in 1999. The band is known as one of the most experimental groups to have come from the alternative metal scene, and are sometimes dubbed by critics as \"the [[Radiohead]] of metal\".<ref name=\"insinginterview\" /><ref name=\"nmebeaumont\" />\n\nDeftones have released eight albums since their inception. After the lineup settled in 1993, the band secured a recording contract with [[Maverick Records]], and subsequently released their debut album ''[[Adrenaline (album)|Adrenaline]]'' in 1995. Promoting the album by touring exhaustively with other bands in the scene, Deftones managed to gain a dedicated fan base through word of mouth. Their sophomore album ''[[Around the Fur]]'' was released in 1997, reached chart positions along with its singles, and became the band's first to receive certification from the [[RIAA]]. The band found even further success with their third album ''[[White Pony]]'' (2000), which saw a transition away from their earlier, more aggressive sound into a more experimental direction. Its lead single \"[[Change (In the House of Flies)]]\" is the band's most commercially successful single, and the track \"[[Elite (song)|Elite]]\" won a [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance]]; it was also the band's first of three albums to be certified platinum in the United States.\n\nTheir [[Deftones (album)|self-titled fourth album]] was released in 2003. While the group's critical success continued, sales proved to be lackluster compared to ''White Pony''. The follow-up, ''[[Saturday Night Wrist]]'', was released in 2006 after a temporary falling out within the band due to creative tensions. Its completion was also delayed by personal issues within the band, some of which influenced its material. In 2008, while Deftones were working on an album tentatively titled ''[[Eros (Deftones album)|Eros]]'', Cheng was involved in a traffic collision. As a result, he was left in a minimally conscious state until his death in 2013 of [[cardiac arrest]]. After Cheng's accident, Deftones halted production on ''Eros''. [[Quicksand (band)|Quicksand]] bassist [[Sergio Vega (bassist)|Sergio Vega]], who had filled in as a touring member to replace Cheng, later became his permanent replacement. The band released ''[[Diamond Eyes]]'' and ''[[Koi No Yokan]]'' in 2010 and 2012 respectively. Their latest release, titled ''[[Gore (album)|Gore]]'', was released in 2016. They have sold over 10 million albums worldwide.<ref name=\"RIAA\"/>\n\n==History==\n===Early years (1988\u201393)===\nWhen [[Stephen Carpenter]] was 15 years old, he was hit by a car while [[skateboarding]].

After a break from touring, the band spent four months in the studio writing and recording it, the longest amount of time they had dedicated to an album thus far. Moreno said that the majority of this time was spent trying to write songs, and that the writing of \"[[Change (In the House of Flies)]]\" was the turning point where the band began working as a unit. Despite being pressured to release the album sooner, the band decided to take their time. Cheng explained, \"We didn't feel like we had anything to lose, so we made the record we wanted to make.\" Moreno did not have an overall lyrical theme in mind, but made a conscious decision to bring an element of fantasy into his lyrics: \"I basically didn't sing about myself on this record. I made up a lot of story lines and some dialogue, even. I took myself completely out of it and wrote about other things\".<ref name=\"AP\">Deftones&nbsp;\u2013 Ride On [interview].

The new release still had \"Pink Maggit\" as the final track and featured altered white cover art. Not entirely happy with re-releasing the album, the band negotiated to have \"Back to School\" made available as a free download for anyone who had already bought the original album. Moreno noted that \"Everybody's already downloaded our record before it came out anyway, otherwise I'd be kind of feelin' like, 'Man, why [are] we putting [out] all these different versions of the record?'

It was formed by [[Chino Moreno]] (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), [[Stephen Carpenter]] (lead guitar), [[Abe Cunningham]] (drums) and Dominic Garcia (bass). During their first five years, the band's lineup changed several times, but stabilized in 1993 when Cunningham rejoined after his departure in 1990; by this time, [[Chi Cheng (musician)|Chi Cheng]] was bassist. The lineup remained stable for fifteen years, with the exception of keyboardist and turntablist [[Frank Delgado (American musician)|Frank Delgado]] being added in 1999. The band is known as one of the most experimental groups to have come from the alternative metal scene, and are sometimes dubbed by critics as \"the [[Radiohead]] of metal\".<ref name=\"insinginterview\" /><ref name=\"nmebeaumont\" />\n\nDeftones have released eight albums since their inception. After the lineup settled in 1993, the band secured a recording contract with [[Maverick Records]], and subsequently released their debut album ''[[Adrenaline (album)|Adrenaline]]'' in 1995. Promoting the album by touring exhaustively with other bands in the scene, Deftones managed to gain a dedicated fan base through word of mouth. Their sophomore album ''[[Around the Fur]]'' was released in 1997, reached chart positions along with its singles, and became the band's first to receive certification from the [[RIAA]]. The band found even further success with their third album ''[[White Pony]]'' (2000), which saw a transition away from their earlier, more aggressive sound into a more experimental direction. Its lead single \"[[Change (In the House of Flies)]]\" is the band's most commercially successful single, and the track \"[[Elite (song)|Elite]]\" won a [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance]]; it was also the band's first of three albums to be certified platinum in the United States.\n\nTheir [[Deftones (album)|self-titled fourth album]] was released in 2003. While the group's critical success continued, sales proved to be lackluster compared to ''White Pony''. The follow-up, ''[[Saturday Night Wrist]]'', was released in 2006 after a temporary falling out within the band due to creative tensions. Its completion was also delayed by personal issues within the band, some of which influenced its material. In 2008, while Deftones were working on an album tentatively titled ''[[Eros (Deftones album)|Eros]]'', Cheng was involved in a traffic collision. As a result, he was left in a minimally conscious state until his death in 2013 of [[cardiac arrest]]. After Cheng's accident, Deftones halted production on ''Eros''. [[Quicksand (band)|Quicksand]] bassist [[Sergio Vega (bassist)|Sergio Vega]], who had filled in as a touring member to replace Cheng, later became his permanent replacement. The band released ''[[Diamond Eyes]]'' and ''[[Koi No Yokan]]'' in 2010 and 2012 respectively. Their latest release, titled ''[[Gore (album)|Gore]]'', was released in 2016. They have sold over 10 million albums worldwide.<ref name=\"RIAA\"/>\n\n==History==\n===Early years (1988\u201393)===\nWhen [[Stephen Carpenter]] was 15 years old, he was hit by a car while [[skateboarding]].

After a break from touring, the band spent four months in the studio writing and recording it, the longest amount of time they had dedicated to an album thus far. Moreno said that the majority of this time was spent trying to write songs, and that the writing of \"[[Change (In the House of Flies)]]\" was the turning point where the band began working as a unit. Despite being pressured to release the album sooner, the band decided to take their time. Cheng explained, \"We didn't feel like we had anything to lose, so we made the record we wanted to make.\" Moreno did not have an overall lyrical theme in mind, but made a conscious decision to bring an element of fantasy into his lyrics: \"I basically didn't sing about myself on this record. I made up a lot of story lines and some dialogue, even. I took myself completely out of it and wrote about other things\".<ref name=\"AP\">Deftones&nbsp;\u2013 Ride On [interview].

Dickson's sudden death just over a week later caused Barton to seek another Queenslander to join his ministry. Philp recommended that Drake be offered the position, and as a result he was appointed [[Postmaster-General of Australia|Postmaster-General]] on 5 February 1901. He was elected to the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] as a [[Protectionist Party|Protectionist]] at the [[1901 Australian federal election|inaugural federal election]] held the following month.<ref name=bio/>\n\nDrake was tasked with establishing a national post and telegraph system from the six existing colonial systems. He secured the passage of  the ''Post and Telegraph Act 1901'', in his [[second reading]] speech expressing the need for non-discrimination in the provision of services and the advantages of a publicly owned telegraph service. He was generally regarded as a competent administrator,<ref name=bio/> although his appointment of Queenslander [[Robert Scott (public servant)|Robert Scott]] as the inaugural head of the [[Postmaster-General's Department]] led to accusation of state bias. ''[[Melbourne Punch|Punch]]'' regarded him as \"a plodder \u2013 thorough rather than brilliant\".<ref name=adb/>\n\nFollowing a reshuffle in August 1903, Drake replaced [[John Forrest]] as [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]]. He held the position for only six weeks, as Attorney-General [[Alfred Deakin]] replaced Barton as prime minister the following month and appointed Drake as his successor. He presented the Commonwealth's arguments in ''[[D'Emden v Pedder]]'', one of the first significant constitutional cases decided by the [[High Court of Australia]].<ref name=adb/> Drake was a strong supporter of the [[White Australia policy]]. Days before the [[1903 Australian federal election|1903 federal election]], in response to the [[SS Petriana|''Petriana'']] affair, he stated that its provisions should even extend to shipwrecked sailors. ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'' reported he had told an election meeting in Sydney:<ref>{{cite journal|last=Foster|first=Leonie|title=Shipwrecks and the White Australia policy|journal=The Great Circle|publisher=The Australian Association for Maritime History|year=2014|volume=36|number=2|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24583070|page=74|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>It was undesirable that educated gentlemen who had been in gaol, or coloured men who had been shipwrecked, should land in Australia in defiance of the law. They intended to keep their race pure, and make Australia a place worth living in.</blockquote>\n\nDeakin's first government fell in April 1904. After a brief interlude of [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP) government led by [[Chris Watson]], opposition leader [[George Reid]] formed a coalition government of his [[Free Trade Party|Free Traders]] and the Protectionists willing to support him. Drake joined the government as [[Vice-President of the Executive Council]] and [[Leader of the Government in the Senate (Australia)|Leader of the Government in the Senate]], holding office until the government fell in July 1905. He was not invited to join the [[Second Deakin Ministry]], although in January 1906 he established ''Commonwealth'', a [[broadsheet]] designed to counter anti-federation feeling in Queensland. He lost [[preselection]] prior to the [[1906 Australian federal election|1906 federal election]], and decided to retire from federal politics rather than stand for re-election as an independent.<ref name=bio/>\n\n==Later life==\nDrake stood for the Queensland state seat of [[Electoral district of North Brisbane|North Brisbane]] in 1907, but only gained 137 votes.<ref name=adb/> He was state crown prosecutor from 1910 to 1920 and in 1912 was appointed Acting Deputy Judge of the [[District Court of Queensland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archivessearch.qld.gov.au/Search/ItemDetails.aspx?ItemId=2768641|title=Instrument of Appointment - Acting Deputy Judge, District Courts - James George Drake, Queensland State Archives Item ID2768641, Letters patent}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nHe died in [[Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital|Brisbane Hospital]] and was buried in [[Toowong Cemetery]].<ref name=bcc>[https://online.brisbane.qld.gov.au/cemeteries/cemeteries_step3.jsp?mapdisplay=148230 Drake James George] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608011916/https://online.brisbane.qld.gov.au/cemeteries/cemeteries_step3.jsp?mapdisplay=148230 |date=8 June 2012 }} \u2013 Brisbane City Council Grave Location Search.

Dickson's sudden death just over a week later caused Barton to seek another Queenslander to join his ministry. Philp recommended that Drake be offered the position, and as a result he was appointed [[Postmaster-General of Australia|Postmaster-General]] on 5 February 1901. He was elected to the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] as a [[Protectionist Party|Protectionist]] at the [[1901 Australian federal election|inaugural federal election]] held the following month.<ref name=bio/>\n\nDrake was tasked with establishing a national post and telegraph system from the six existing colonial systems. He secured the passage of  the ''Post and Telegraph Act 1901'', in his [[second reading]] speech expressing the need for non-discrimination in the provision of services and the advantages of a publicly owned telegraph service. He was generally regarded as a competent administrator,<ref name=bio/> although his appointment of Queenslander [[Robert Scott (public servant)|Robert Scott]] as the inaugural head of the [[Postmaster-General's Department]] led to accusation of state bias. ''[[Melbourne Punch|Punch]]'' regarded him as \"a plodder \u2013 thorough rather than brilliant\".<ref name=adb/>\n\nFollowing a reshuffle in August 1903, Drake replaced [[John Forrest]] as [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]]. He held the position for only six weeks, as Attorney-General [[Alfred Deakin]] replaced Barton as prime minister the following month and appointed Drake as his successor. He presented the Commonwealth's arguments in ''[[D'Emden v Pedder]]'', one of the first significant constitutional cases decided by the [[High Court of Australia]].<ref name=adb/> Drake was a strong supporter of the [[White Australia policy]]. Days before the [[1903 Australian federal election|1903 federal election]], in response to the [[SS Petriana|''Petriana'']] affair, he stated that its provisions should even extend to shipwrecked sailors. ''[[The Argus]]'' reported he had told an election meeting in Sydney:<ref>{{cite journal|last=Foster|first=Leonie|title=Shipwrecks and the White Australia policy|journal=The Great Circle|publisher=The Australian Association for Maritime History|year=2014|volume=36|number=2|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24583070|page=74|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>It was undesirable that educated gentlemen who had been in gaol, or coloured men who had been shipwrecked, should land in Australia in defiance of the law. They intended to keep their race pure, and make Australia a place worth living in.</blockquote>\n\nDeakin's first government fell in April 1904. After a brief interlude of [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP) government led by [[Chris Watson]], opposition leader [[George Reid]] formed a coalition government of his [[Free Trade Party|Free Traders]] and the Protectionists willing to support him. Drake joined the government as [[Vice-President of the Executive Council]] and [[Leader of the Government in the Senate (Australia)|Leader of the Government in the Senate]], holding office until the government fell in July 1905. He was not invited to join the [[Second Deakin Ministry]], although in January 1906 he established ''Commonwealth'', a [[broadsheet]] designed to counter anti-federation feeling in Queensland. He lost [[preselection]] prior to the [[1906 Australian federal election|1906 federal election]], and decided to retire from federal politics rather than stand for re-election as an independent.<ref name=bio/>\n\n==Later life==\nDrake stood for the Queensland state seat of [[Electoral district of North Brisbane|North Brisbane]] in 1907, but only gained 137 votes.<ref name=adb/> He was state crown prosecutor from 1910 to 1920 and in 1912 was appointed Acting Deputy Judge of the [[District Court of Queensland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archivessearch.qld.gov.au/Search/ItemDetails.aspx?ItemId=2768641|title=Instrument of Appointment - Acting Deputy Judge, District Courts - James George Drake, Queensland State Archives Item ID2768641, Letters patent}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nHe died in [[Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital|Brisbane Hospital]] and was buried in [[Toowong Cemetery]].<ref name=bcc>[https://online.brisbane.qld.gov.au/cemeteries/cemeteries_step3.jsp?mapdisplay=148230 Drake James George] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608011916/https://online.brisbane.qld.gov.au/cemeteries/cemeteries_step3.jsp?mapdisplay=148230 |date=8 June 2012 }} \u2013 Brisbane City Council Grave Location Search.
