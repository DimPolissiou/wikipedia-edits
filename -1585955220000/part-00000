Maakhir's other stated aim was to provide much-needed public services by opening up a treasury office in Badhan, to ensure governance structures for the safety and maintenance of [[Laasqoray]] Port, and the protection of private local enterprises whose operational management and ownership fall under the guidance of the private sector of Maakhir state.<ref>[http://www.laasqorayport.org/inner.asp?cat=operations Laas Qorey Port Operation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008115846/http://www.laasqorayport.org/inner.asp?cat=operations |date=8 October 2007 }}.</ref> A third objective was to manage the complex local conflicts by strengthening the already existing traditional mechanisms, which will be consolidated and run by the Department of Justice.\n\nMaakhir sought to structure consensus around peace, internal security, market stability, cooperation and unity of purpose with its neighbors; and build bridges of trust and social harmony across dividing political lines and between opposing interests and groupings.\n\nNeither Somaliland or Puntland have recognized the state.

The old capital of the Warsangali sultanate was Las Khorey.\n\nThe Sultanate of Mohamoud Ali Shire was considered by colonial authorities as having largely hegemonic authority over the other Harti sultanates, and the Warsangali played a large role in 19th century administration of [[Italian Somaliland|Italian]] and [[British Somaliland]]. As the 20th century began however, the British and Italians ended the independence of the semi-independent Sultanates, and the Harti Confederation was dissolved in the midst of Italian and British rule, ending the traditional role of the Warsangali. Sultan Mohamoud Ali Shireh was exiled to the [[Seychelles]] \u2013 \"the islands to which many prominent anti-colonial leaders used to be exiled\".<ref>[http://www.wardheernews.com/articles/may/20_Garaad%20Mohamoud%20Ali%20Shire.htm A Touching Glimpse of History and the Reunion of a Somali Royalty] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222936/http://wardheernews.com/articles/may/20_Garaad%20Mohamoud%20Ali%20Shire.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\nAfter independence, the Majeerteen emerged as the leaders of the Harti group following the USP's merger with SYL\u2014active political parties on the eve of Somali independence.

The development of cryo-electron microscopy techniques has allowed for increased resolution of the image, leading to a more precise method to determine structure. Different structural configurations of polyribosomes could reflect a variety in translation of mRNAs. An investigation of the ratio of polyribosomal shape elucidated that a high number of circular and zigzag polysomes were found after several rounds of translation. A longer period of translation caused the formation of densely packed 3-D helical polysomes<ref name=\":0\" />. Different cells produce different structures of polysomes.\n\n=== Prokaryotic Polysomes ===\nProkaryotic polysomes have been found to form double-row structures. In this conformation, the ribosomes are contacting each other through smaller subunits. These double row structures generally have a \u201csinusoidal\u201d (zigzag) or 3-D helical path. In the \u201csinusoidal\u201d path, there are two types of contact between the small subunits- \u201ctop-to-top\u201d or \u201ctop-to-bottom\u201d. In the 3-D helical path, only \u201ctop-to-top\u201d contact is observed<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n=== Eukaryotic Polysomes ===\n\n==== ''in situ'' ====\n''in situ'' (in cell) studies have shown that eukaryotic polysomes exhibit linear configurations. Densely packed 3-D helices and planar double-row polysomes were found with variable packing including \u201ctop-to-top\u201d contacts similar to prokaryotic polysomes. Eukaryotic 3-D polyribosomes are similar to prokaryotic 3-D polyribosomes in that they are \u201cdensely packed left-handed helices with four ribosomes per turn\u201d. This dense packing can determine their function as regulators of translation, with 3-D polyribosomes being found in sarcoma cells using fluorescence microscopy<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n==== ''in vitro'' ====\nAtomic force microscopy used in in vitro studies have shown that circular eukaryotic polysomes can be formed by free polyadenylated mRNA in the presence of initiation factor eIF4E bound to the 5\u2019 cap and PABP bound to the 3\u2019-poly(A) tail. However, this interaction between cap and poly(A)-tail mediated by a protein complex is not a unique way of circularizing polysomal mRNA. It has been found that topologically circular polyribosomes can be successfully formed in the translational system with mRNA with no cap and no poly(A) tail as well as a capped mRNA without a 3\u2019-poly(A) tail<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n=== Membrane-bound Polysomes ===\nPolyribosomes bound to membranes are restricted by a 2 dimensional space given by the membrane surface. The restriction of inter-ribosomal contacts causes a round-shape configuration that arranges ribosomes along the mRNA so that the entry and exit sites form a smooth pathway. Each ribosome is turned relative to the previous one, resembling a planar spiral<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n== Polysomal Profiling ==\nPolysomal Profiling is a technique that uses cycloheximide to arrest translation and a sucrose gradient to separate the resulting cell extract by centrifugation<ref name=\":1\" />. Ribosome-associated mRNAs migrate faster than free mRNAs and polysome associated mRNAs migrate faster than ribosome associated mRNAs. Several peaks corresponding to mRNA are revealed by the measurement of total protein across the gradient. The corresponding mRNA is associated with increasing numbers of ribosomes as polysomes. The presence of mRNA across the gradient reveals the translation of the mRNA.
