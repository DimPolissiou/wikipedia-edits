The model is used to generate predictions of sensory input that are compared to actual sensory input. This comparison results in prediction errors that are then used to update and revise the mental model.\n\n==Origins==\nTheoretical ancestors to predictive coding date back as early as 1860 with Helmholtz's concept of [[unconscious inference]]. Unconscious inference refers to the idea that the human brain fills in visual information to make sense of a scene. For example, if something is relatively smaller than another object in the visual field, the brain uses that information as a likely cue of depth, such that the perceiver ultimately (and involuntarily) experiences depth. The understanding of perception as the interaction between sensory stimuli (bottom-up) and conceptual knowledge (top-down) continued to be established by [[Jerome Bruner]] who, starting in the 1940s, studied the ways in which needs, motivations and expectations influence perception, research that came to be known as 'New Look' psychology. In 1981, [[James McClelland (psychologist)|McClelland]] and [[David Rumelhart|Rumelhart]] in their seminal paper{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} examined the interaction between processing features (lines and contours) which form letters, which in turn form words. While the features suggest the presence of a word, they found that when letters were situated in the context of a word, people were able to identify them faster than when they were situated in a non-word without semantic context. McClelland and Rumelhart's parallel processing model describes perception as the meeting of top-down (conceptual) and bottom-up (sensory) elements.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the idea of top-down and bottom-up processing was translated into a computational model of vision by [[Rajesh Rao|Rao]] and [[Dana H. Ballard|Ballard]] (1999). Their paper demonstrated that there could be a generative model of a scene (top-down processing), which would receive feedback via error signals (how much the visual input varied from the prediction), which would subsequently lead to updating the prediction. The computational model was able to replicate well-established receptive field effects, as well as less understood extra-classical receptive field effects such as [[Hypercomplex cell|end-stopping]]. Today, the fields of computer science and cognitive science incorporate these same concepts to create the multilayer generative models that underlie machine learning and neural nets ([[Geoff Hinton|Hinton]], 2010).\n\n== General framework ==\nMost of the research literature in the field has been about [[sensory perception]], particularly vision, which is more easily conceptualized. However, the predictive coding framework could also be applied to different neural systems. Taking the sensory system as an example, the brain solves the seemingly intractable problem of modelling distal causes of sensory input through a version of [[Bayesian inference]]. It does this by modelling predictions of lower-level sensory inputs via backward connections from relatively higher levels in a cortical hierarchy (Clark, 2013). \nConstrained by the statistical regularities of the outside world (and certain evolutionarily prepared predictions), the brain encodes top-down generative models at various temporal and spatial scales in order to predict and effectively suppress sensory inputs rising up from lower levels. A comparison between predictions (priors) and sensory input (likelihood) yields a difference measure (e.g. prediction error, free energy, or surprise) which, if it is sufficiently large beyond the levels of expected statistical noise, will cause the generative model to update so that it better predicts sensory input in the future.\n\nIf, instead, the model accurately predicts driving sensory signals, activity at higher levels cancels out activity at lower levels, and the posterior probability of the model is increased. Thus, predictive coding inverts the conventional view of perception as a mostly bottom-up process, suggesting that it is largely constrained by prior predictions, where signals from the external world only shape perception to the extent that they are propagated up the cortical hierarchy in the form of prediction error.\n\n===Precision weighting===\n \nExpectations about the precision (or inverse variance) of incoming sensory input are crucial for effectively minimizing prediction error in that the expected precision of a given prediction error can inform confidence in that error, which influences the extent to which the error is weighted in updating predictions (Feldman & Friston, 2010). Given that the world we live in is loaded with [[statistical noise]], precision expectations must be represented as part of the brain's generative models, and they should be able to flexibly adapt to changing contexts. For instance, the expected precision of visual prediction errors likely varies between dawn and dusk, such that greater conditional confidence is assigned to errors in broad daylight than errors in prediction at nightfall (Hohwy, 2012). It has recently been proposed that such weighting of prediction errors in proportion to their estimated precision is, in essence, attention (Friston, 2009), and that the process of devoting attention may be neurobiologically accomplished by ascending reticular activating systems (ARAS) optimizing the \u201cgain\u201d of prediction error units.\n\n===Active inference===\nThe same principle of prediction error minimization has been used to provide an account of behavior in which motor actions are not commands but descending proprioceptive predictions. In this scheme of [[active inference]], classical reflex arcs are coordinated so as to selectively sample sensory input in ways that better fulfill predictions, thereby minimizing proprioceptive prediction errors (Friston, 2009). Indeed, Adams et al. (2013) review evidence suggesting that this view of hierarchical predictive coding in the motor system provides a principled and neurally plausible framework for explaining the agranular organization of the motor cortex. This view suggests that \u201cperceptual and motor systems should not be regarded as separate but instead as a single active inference machine that tries to predict its sensory input in all domains: visual, auditory, somatosensory, interoceptive and, in the case of the motor system, proprioceptive\u201d (Adams, Shipp, & Friston, 2013).\n\n==Neural theory in predictive coding==\nEvaluating the empirical evidence that suggests a neurologically plausible basis for predictive coding is a broad and varied task. For one thing, and according to the model, predictive coding occurs at every iterative step in the perceptual and cognitive processes; accordingly, manifestations of predictive coding in the brain include genetics, specific cytoarchitecture of cells, systemic networks of neurons, and whole brain analyses. Due to this range of specificity, different methods of investigating the neural mechanisms of predictive coding have been applied, where available; more generally, however, and at least as it relates to humans, there are significant methodological limitations to investigating the potential evidence and much of the work is based on computational modeling of microcircuits in the brain. Notwithstanding, there has been substantial (theoretical) work that has been applied to understanding predictive coding mechanisms in the brain. This section will focus on specific evidence as it relates to the predictive coding phenomenon, rather than analogues, such as homeostasis (which are, nonetheless, integral to our overall understanding of Bayesian inference but already supported heavily; see Clark, 2012 for a review).\n\nMuch of the early work that applied a predictive coding framework to neural mechanisms came from sensory neurons, particularly in the visual cortex (e.g., Rao and Ballard, 1999; Bolz & Gilbert, 1986).\n\nMore generally, however, what seems to be required by the theory are (at least) two types of neurons (at every level of the perceptual hierarchy): one set of neurons that encode incoming sensory input, so called feed-forward projections; one set of neurons that send down predictions, so called feed-backward projections. It is important to note that these neurons must also carry properties of error detection; which class of neurons has these properties is still up for debate (see Koster-Hale & Saxe, 2013; Seth, 2013). These sort of neurons have found support in superficial and non-superficial pyramidal neurons.\n\nAt a more whole-brain level, there is evidence that different cortical layers (aka laminae) may facilitate the integration of feedforward and feed-backward projections across hierarchies. These cortical layers, divided into granular, agranular, and dysgranular, which house the subpopulations of neurons mentioned above, are divided into 6 main layers. The cytoarchitecture within these layers are the same, but they differ across layers. For example, layer 4 of the granular cortex contain granule cells which are excitatory and distribute thalamocortical inputs to the rest of the cortex. According to one model: <blockquote>\n\n\u201c...prediction neurons... in deep layers of agranular cortex drive active inference by sending sensory predictions via projections ...to supragranular layers of dysgranular and granular sensory cortices. Prediction-error neurons \u2026.in the supragranular layers of granular cortex compute the difference between the predicted and received sensory signal, and send prediction-error signals via projections...back to the deep layers of agranular cortical regions. Precision cells \u2026 tune the gain on predictions and prediction error dynamically, thereby giving these signals reduced (or, in some cases, greater) weight depending on the relative confidence in the descending predictions or the reliability of incoming sensory signals.\u201d (Barrett & Simmons, 2015)</blockquote>\n\nIn sum, the neural evidence is still in its infancy.\n\n==Applying predictive coding==\n===Perception===\nThe empirical evidence for predictive coding is most robust for perceptual processing. As early as 1999, Rao and Ballard proposed a hierarchical [[visual processing]] model in which higher-order visual cortical area sends down predictions and the feedforward connections carry the residual errors between the predictions and the actual lower-level activities (Rao and Ballard, 1999). According to this model, each level in the hierarchical model network (except the lowest level, which represents the image) attempts to predict the responses at the next lower level via feedback connections, and the error signal is used to correct the estimate of the input signal at each level concurrently (Rao and Ballard, 1999). Emberson et al. established the top-down modulation in infants using a cross-modal audiovisual omission paradigm, determining that even infant brains have expectation about future sensory input that is carried downstream from visual cortices and are capable of expectation-based feedback (Emberson et al., 2015). Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data showed that infant [[occipital cortex]] responded to unexpected visual omission (with no visual information input) but not to expected visual omission. These results establish that in a hierarchically organized perception system, higher-order neurons send down predictions to lower-order neurons, which in turn sends back up the prediction error signal.\n\n===Interoception===\n{{Main|Interoception}}\nThere have been several competing models for the role of predictive coding in [[interoception]].\n\nIn 2013, Anil Seth proposed that our subjective feeling states, otherwise known as emotions, are generated by predictive models that are actively built out of causal interoceptive appraisals.\nIn relation to how we attribute internal states of others to causes, Sasha Ondobaka, James Kilner, and Karl Friston (2015) proposed that the free energy principle requires the brain to produce a continuous series of predictions with the goal of reducing the amount of prediction error that manifests as \u201cfree energy\u201d. These errors are then used to model anticipatory information about what the state of the outside world will be and attributions of causes of that world state, including understanding of causes of others\u2019 behavior. This is especially necessary because, to create these attributions, our multimodal sensory systems need interoceptive predictions to organize themselves. Therefore, Ondobaka posits that predictive coding is key to understanding other people's internal states.\n\nIn 2015, Lisa Barrett and W. Kyle Simmons (2015) proposed the Embodied Predictive Interoception Coding model, a framework that unifies Bayesian active inference principles with a physiological framework of corticocortical connections. Using this model, they posited that agranular visceromotor cortices are responsible for generating predictions about interoception, thus, defining the experience of interoception.\n\nIn 2017, contrary to the inductive notion that emotion categories are biologically distinct, Barrett (2017) proposed the theory of constructed emotion, which is the account that a biological emotion category is constructed based on a conceptual category\u2014the accumulation of instances sharing a goal. In a predictive coding model, Barrett hypothesizes that, in interoception, our brains regulate our bodies by activating \"embodied simulations\" (full-bodied representations of sensory experience) to anticipate what our brains predict that the external world will throw at us sensorially and how we will respond to it with action. These simulations are either preserved if, based on our brain's predictions, they prepare us well for what actually subsequently occurs in the external world, or they, and our predictions, are adjusted to compensate for their error in comparison to what actually occurs in the external world and how well-prepared we were for it. Then, in a trial-error-adjust process, our bodies find similarities in goals among certain successful anticipatory simulations and group them together under conceptual categories. Every time a new experience arises, our brains use this past trial-error-adjust history to match the new experience to one of the categories of accumulated corrected simulations that is shares the most similarity with. Then, they apply the corrected simulation of that category to the new experience in the hopes of preparing our bodies for the rest of the experience. If it does not, the prediction, the simulation, and perhaps the boundaries of the conceptual category are revised in the hopes of higher accuracy next time, and the process continues. Barrett hypothesizes that, when prediction error for a certain category of simulations for x-like experiences is minimized, what results is a correction-informed simulation that the body will reenact for every x-like experience, resulting in a correction-informed full-bodied representation of sensory experience\u2014an emotion. In this sense, Barrett proposes that we construct our emotions because the conceptual category framework our brains use to compare new experiences, and to pick the appropriate predictive sensory simulation to activate, is built on the go.\n\n===Challenges===\nAs a mechanistic theory, predictive coding has not been mapped out physiologically on the neuronal level. One of the biggest challenges to the theory has been the imprecision of exactly how prediction error minimization works (Kogo & Trengove, 2015). In some studies, the increase in [[Blood-oxygen-level dependent imaging|BOLD]] signal has been interpreted as error signal while in others it indicates changes in the input representation (Kogo & Trengove, 2015). A crucial question that needs to be addressed is what exactly constitutes error signal and how it is computed at each level of information processing (Bastos et al., 2012). Another challenge that has been posed is predictive coding's computational tractability. According to Kwisthout and van Rooij, the subcomputation in each level of the predictive coding framework potentially hides a computationally intractable problem, which amounts to \u201cintractable hurdles\u201d that computational modelers have yet to overcome (Kwisthout & van Rooij, 2019). Ransom and Fazelpour (2015) indicate \"Three Problems for the Predictive Coding Theory of Attention\".\n\nFuture research could focus on clarifying the neurophysiological mechanism and computational model of predictive coding.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Blue Brain Project]]\n*[[Cognitive biology]]\n*[[Cognitive linguistics]]\n*[[Cognitive neuropsychology]]\n*[[Cognitive neuroscience]]\n*[[Cognitive science]]\n*[[Conceptual blending]]\n*[[Conceptual metaphor]]\n*[[Embodied bilingual language]]\n*[[Embodied cognitive science]]\n*[[Embodied Embedded Cognition]]\n*[[Embodied music cognition]]\n*[[Enactivism]]\n*[[Extended cognition]]\n*[[Extended mind thesis]]\n*[[Externalism]]\n*[[Image schema]]\n*[[Memory-prediction framework]]\n*[[Moravec's paradox]]\n*[[Neuroconstructivism]]\n*[[Neuropsychology]]\n*[[Neurophenomenology]]\n*[[Philosophy of mind]]\n*[[Plant cognition]]\n*[[Practopoiesis]]\n*[[Situated cognition]]\n*[[Where Mathematics Comes From]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n*Adams, R.

These simulations are either preserved if, based on our brain's predictions, they prepare us well for what actually subsequently occurs in the external world, or they, and our predictions, are adjusted to compensate for their error in comparison to what actually occurs in the external world and how well-prepared we were for it. Then, in a trial-error-adjust process, our bodies find similarities in goals among certain successful anticipatory simulations and group them together under conceptual categories. Every time a new experience arises, our brains use this past trial-error-adjust history to match the new experience to one of the categories of accumulated corrected simulations that is shares the most similarity with. Then, they apply the corrected simulation of that category to the new experience in the hopes of preparing our bodies for the rest of the experience. If it does not, the prediction, the simulation, and perhaps the boundaries of the conceptual category are revised in the hopes of higher accuracy next time, and the process continues. Barrett hypothesizes that, when prediction error for a certain category of simulations for x-like experiences is minimized, what results is a correction-informed simulation that the body will reenact for every x-like experience, resulting in a correction-informed full-bodied representation of sensory experience\u2014an emotion. In this sense, Barrett proposes that we construct our emotions because the conceptual category framework our brains use to compare new experiences, and to pick the appropriate predictive sensory simulation to activate, is built on the go.\n\n===Challenges===\nAs a mechanistic theory, predictive coding has not been mapped out physiologically on the neuronal level. One of the biggest challenges to the theory has been the imprecision of exactly how prediction error minimization works (Kogo & Trengove, 2015). In some studies, the increase in [[Blood-oxygen-level dependent imaging|BOLD]] signal has been interpreted as error signal while in others it indicates changes in the input representation (Kogo & Trengove, 2015). A crucial question that needs to be addressed is what exactly constitutes error signal and how it is computed at each level of information processing (Bastos et al., 2012). Another challenge that has been posed is predictive coding's computational tractability. According to Kwisthout and van Rooij, the subcomputation in each level of the predictive coding framework potentially hides a computationally intractable problem, which amounts to \u201cintractable hurdles\u201d that computational modelers have yet to overcome (Kwisthout & van Rooij, 2019). Ransom and Fazelpour (2015) indicate \"Three Problems for the Predictive Coding Theory of Attention\".\n\nFuture research could focus on clarifying the neurophysiological mechanism and computational model of predictive coding.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Blue Brain Project]]\n*[[Cognitive biology]]\n*[[Cognitive linguistics]]\n*[[Cognitive neuropsychology]]\n*[[Cognitive neuroscience]]\n*[[Cognitive science]]\n*[[Conceptual blending]]\n*[[Conceptual metaphor]]\n*[[Embodied bilingual language]]\n*[[Embodied cognitive science]]\n*[[Embodied Embedded Cognition]]\n*[[Embodied music cognition]]\n*[[Enactivism]]\n*[[Extended cognition]]\n*[[Extended mind thesis]]\n*[[Externalism]]\n*[[Image schema]]\n*[[Memory-prediction framework]]\n*[[Moravec's paradox]]\n*[[Neuroconstructivism]]\n*[[Neuropsychology]]\n*[[Neurophenomenology]]\n*[[Philosophy of mind]]\n*[[Plant cognition]]\n*[[Practopoiesis]]\n*[[Situated cognition]]\n*[[Where Mathematics Comes From]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n*Adams, R.

The story and emotional content of a musical&nbsp;\u2013 humor, [[pathos]], love, anger&nbsp;\u2013 are communicated through words, music, movement and technical aspects of the entertainment as an integrated whole. Although musical theatre overlaps with other theatrical forms like [[opera]] and dance, it may be distinguished by the equal importance given to the music as compared with the dialogue, movement and other elements. Since the early 20th century, musical theatre stage works have generally been called, simply, '''musicals'''.\n\nAlthough music has been a part of dramatic presentations since ancient times, modern Western musical theatre emerged during the 19th century, with many structural elements established by the works of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] in Britain and those of [[Edward Harrigan|Harrigan]] and [[Tony Hart (theater)|Hart]] in America. These were followed by the numerous [[Edwardian musical comedies]] and the musical theatre works of American creators like [[George M. Cohan]] at the turn of the 20th century. The [[Princess Theatre, New York City|Princess Theatre]] musicals (1915\u20131918) and other smart shows like ''[[Of Thee I Sing]]'' (1931) were artistic steps forward beyond [[revue]]s and other frothy entertainments of the early 20th century and led to such groundbreaking works as ''[[Show Boat]]'' (1927) and ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' (1943).  Some of the most famous musicals through the decades that followed include<!-- Please DO NOT ADD new names to the following list.

Make any suggestions for changes or updates on the talk page. -->\n\nMusicals are performed around the world. They may be presented in large venues, such as big-budget [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] or [[West End theatre|West End]] productions in New York City or London. Alternatively, musicals may be staged in smaller venues, such as [[fringe theatre]], [[Off-Broadway]], [[Off-Off-Broadway]], [[Regional theater in the United States|regional theatre]], or [[community theatre]] productions, or [[Touring theatre|on tour]]. Musicals are often presented by [[amateur theatre|amateur and school groups]] in churches, schools and other performance spaces. In addition to the United States and Britain, there are vibrant musical theatre scenes in continental Europe, Asia, Australasia, Canada and Latin America.\n{{TOC limit|4}}\n\n== Definitions and scope ==\n<span id=\"Definitions\"></span>\n\n=== Book musicals ===\n[[File:GaietyGirlDudleyHardy.jpg|thumb|''[[A Gaiety Girl]]'' (1893) was one of the first hit musicals]]\nSince the 20th century, the \"book musical\" has been defined as a musical play where songs and dances are fully integrated into a well-made story with serious dramatic goals that is able to evoke genuine emotions other than laughter.{{sfn|Everett|Laird|2002|p=137}}{{sfn|Rubin|Sol\u00f3rzano|2000|p=438}} The three main components of a book musical are its ''music'', ''lyrics'' and ''book''. The book or [[Script (performing arts)|script]] of a musical refers to the story, character development and dramatic structure, including the spoken dialogue and stage directions, but it can also refer to the dialogue and lyrics together, which are sometimes referred to as the ''[[libretto]]'' (Italian for \"little book\"). The music and lyrics together form the ''[[theatre music|score]]'' of a musical and include songs, [[incidental music]] and musical scenes, which are \"theatrical sequence[s] set to music, often combining song with spoken dialogue.\"<ref name=Continuum>{{cite book |last1=Shepherd |first1=John |last2=Horn |first2=David|year=2012| title=Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Volume 8: Genres: North America |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=__DTvryrBZkC&pg=PA104 |publisher=A&C Black| page=104 |isbn=978-1-4411-4874-2}}</ref> The interpretation of a musical is the responsibility of its creative team, which includes a [[theatre director|director]], a [[musical director]], usually a [[choreographer]] and sometimes an [[orchestrator]]. A musical's production is also creatively characterized by technical aspects, such as [[set design]], [[costume]]s, [[Theatrical property|stage properties (props)]], [[Stage lighting|lighting]] and sound. The creative team, designs and interpretations generally change from the original production to succeeding productions. Some production elements, however, may be retained from the original production, for example, [[Bob Fosse]]'s choreography in ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]''.\n\nThere is no fixed length for a musical. While it can range from a short one-act entertainment to several [[Act (theatre)|acts]] and several hours in length (or even a multi-evening presentation), most musicals range from one and a half to three hours. Musicals are usually presented in two acts, with one short [[intermission]], and the first act is frequently longer than the second. The first act generally introduces nearly all of the characters and most of the music and often ends with the introduction of a dramatic conflict or plot complication while the second act may introduce a few new songs but usually contains reprises of important musical themes and resolves the conflict or complication. A book musical is usually built around four to six main theme tunes that are reprised later in the show, although it sometimes consists of a series of songs not directly musically related. Spoken dialogue is generally interspersed between musical numbers, although \"sung dialogue\" or [[recitative]] may be used, especially in so-called \"[[sung-through]]\" musicals such as ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'', ''[[Falsettos]]'', ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|Les Mis\u00e9rables]]'', ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'' and ''[[Hamilton (musical)|Hamilton]]''. Several shorter musicals on Broadway and in the West End have been presented in one act in recent decades.\n\nMoments of greatest dramatic intensity in a book musical are often performed in song. Proverbially, \"when the emotion becomes too strong for speech, you sing; when it becomes too strong for song, you dance.\"<ref>Wattenberg, Ben. [https://www.pbs.org/thinktank/transcript1261.html ''The American Musical, Part 2''], PBS.org, May 24, 2007, accessed February 7, 2017</ref> In a book musical, a song is ideally crafted to suit the character (or characters) and their situation within the story; although there have been times in the history of the musical (e.g. from the 1890s to the 1920s) when this integration between music and story has been tenuous. As ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[Ben Brantley]] described the ideal of song in theatre when reviewing the 2008 revival of ''[[Gypsy (musical)|Gypsy]]'': \"There is no separation at all between song and character, which is what happens in those uncommon moments when musicals reach upward to achieve their ideal reasons to be.\"<ref>Brantley, Ben. [http://theater2.nytimes.com/2008/03/28/theater/reviews/28gyps.html?pagewanted=all \"Curtain Up! It's Patti's Turn at ''Gypsy''\"], ''The New York Times'', March 28, 2008, accessed May 26, 2009</ref> Typically, many fewer words are sung in a five-minute song than are spoken in a five-minute block of dialogue. Therefore, there is less time to develop drama in a musical than in a straight play of equivalent length, since a musical usually devotes more time to music than to dialogue. Within the compressed nature of a musical, the writers must develop the characters and the plot.\n\nThe material presented in a musical may be original, or it may be adapted from novels (''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'' and ''[[Man of La Mancha]]''), plays (''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' and ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]''), classic legends (''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]''), historical events (''Evita'') or films (''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'' and ''[[Billy Elliot the Musical|Billy Elliot]]''). On the other hand, many successful musical theatre works have been adapted for [[musical film]]s, such as ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'', ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'', ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'', ''[[Oliver! (film)|Oliver!]]'' and ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]''.\n\n=== Comparisons with opera ===\n[[File:George Gershwin 1937.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[George Gershwin]]]]\nMusical theatre is closely related to the theatrical form of [[opera]], but the two are usually distinguished by weighing a number of factors. First, musicals generally have a greater focus on spoken dialogue. Some musicals, however, are entirely accompanied and sung-through, while some operas, such as ''[[Die Zauberfl\u00f6te]]'', and most [[operetta]]s, have some unaccompanied dialogue.  Second, musicals also usually include more dancing as an essential part of the storytelling, particularly by the principal performers as well as the chorus. Third, musicals often use various genres of [[popular music]] or at least popular singing and musical styles.<ref>[[Anthony Tommasini|Tommasini, Anthony]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/10/theater/musical-or-opera-the-fine-line-that-divides-them.html \"Opera? Musical? Please Respect the Difference\"], ''The New York Times'', July 7, 2011, accessed December 13, 2017</ref>\n\nFinally, musicals usually avoid certain operatic conventions. In particular, a musical is almost always performed in the language of its audience. Musicals produced on Broadway or in the West End, for instance, are invariably sung in English, even if they were originally written in another language. While an opera singer is primarily a singer and only secondarily an actor (and rarely needs to dance), a musical theatre performer is often an actor first but must also be a singer and dancer. Someone who is equally accomplished at all three is referred to as a \"triple threat\". Composers of music for musicals often consider the vocal demands of roles with musical theatre performers in mind. Today, large theatres that stage musicals generally use [[microphone]]s and [[sound reinforcement system|amplification]] of the actors' singing voices in a way that would generally be disapproved of in an operatic context.<ref>Gamerman, Ellen.

Meanwhile, on the continent, [[singspiel]], [[com\u00e9die en vaudeville]], [[op\u00e9ra comique]], [[zarzuela]] and other forms of light musical entertainment were emerging.

He experimented with a modern-dress, family-friendly musical theatre style, with breezy, popular songs, snappy, romantic banter, and stylish spectacle at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety]] and his other theatres. These drew on the traditions of comic opera and used elements of burlesque and of the Harrigan and Hart pieces. He replaced the bawdy women of burlesque with his \"respectable\" corps of [[Gaiety Girls]] to complete the musical and visual fun. The success of the first of these, ''[[In Town (musical)|In Town]]'' (1892) and ''[[A Gaiety Girl]]'' (1893) set the style for the next three decades. The plots were generally light, romantic \"poor maiden loves aristocrat and wins him against all odds\" shows, with music by [[Ivan Caryll]], [[Sidney Jones (composer)|Sidney Jones]] and [[Lionel Monckton]]. These shows were immediately widely copied in America, and [[Edwardian musical comedy]] swept away the earlier musical forms of comic opera and operetta. ''[[The Geisha]]'' (1896) was one of the most successful in the 1890s, running for more than two years and achieving great international success.\n\n''[[The Belle of New York (musical)|The Belle of New York]]'' (1898) became the first American musical to run for over a year in London.

After the turn of the 20th century, [[Seymour Hicks]] joined forces with Edwardes and American producer [[Charles Frohman]] to create another decade of popular shows.

Harburg]] and [[Fred Saidy]] combined political satire with Irish whimsy for their fantasy ''[[Finian's Rainbow]]'' (1947, 725 performances); and Cole Porter found inspiration in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' for ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'' (1948, 1,077 performances). The American musicals overwhelmed the old-fashioned British Coward/Novello-style shows, one of the last big successes of which was Novello's ''[[Perchance to Dream (musical)|Perchance to Dream]]'' (1945, 1,021 performances).  The formula for the Golden Age musicals reflected one or more of four widely held perceptions of the \"American dream\": That stability and worth derives from a love relationship sanctioned and restricted by Protestant ideals of marriage; that a married couple should make a moral home with children away from the city in a suburb or small town; that the woman's function was as homemaker and mother; and that Americans incorporate an independent and pioneering spirit or that their success is self-made.{{sfn|Rubin|Sol\u00f3rzano|2000|pp=439\u2013440}}\n\n==== 1950s ====\n{{Further|Musical film}}\n[[File:JulieAndrews face.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Julie Andrews]]]]\nThe 1950s were crucial to the development of the American musical.<ref>Marks, Peter.

Popular Hollywood films were made of all of these musicals. This surpassed the run of two hits by British creators: ''[[The Boy Friend (musical)|The Boy Friend]]'' (1954), which ran for 2,078 performances in London and marked Andrews' American debut, was very briefly the third longest-running musical in West End or Broadway history (after ''Chu Chin Chow'' and ''Oklahoma!''), until ''[[Salad Days (musical)|Salad Days]]'' (1954) surpassed its run and became the new long-run record holder, with 2,283 performances.<ref name=Salad/>\n\nAnother record was set by ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', which ran for 2,707 performances, becoming the longest-running off-Broadway musical until ''[[The Fantasticks]]''. The production also broke ground by showing that musicals could be profitable off-Broadway in a small-scale, small orchestra format. This was confirmed in 1959 when a revival of [[Jerome Kern]] and [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Leave It to Jane]]'' ran for more than two years.

It ran for 1,443 performances and shared the Tony Award for Best Musical. Together with its extremely successful [[The Sound of Music (film)|1965 film version]], it has become one of the most popular musicals in history.\n\n==== 1960s ====\nIn 1960, ''The Fantasticks'' was first produced off-Broadway. This intimate allegorical show would quietly run for over 40 years at the Sullivan Street Theatre in [[Greenwich Village]], becoming by far the longest-running musical in history. Its authors produced other innovative works in the 1960s, such as ''[[Celebration (musical)|Celebration]]'' and ''[[I Do! I Do!]]'', the first two-character Broadway musical. The 1960s would see a number of blockbusters, like ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' (1964; 3,242 performances), ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' (1964; 2,844 performances), ''[[Funny Girl (musical)|Funny Girl]]'' (1964; 1,348 performances) and ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'' (1965; 2,328 performances), and some more risqu\u00e9 pieces like ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'', before ending with the emergence of the [[rock musical]]. Two men had considerable impact on musical theatre history beginning in this decade: [[Stephen Sondheim]] and [[Jerry Herman]].\n\n[[File:Peters in 08.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Bernadette Peters]] (shown in 2008) has starred in five Sondheim musicals]]\nThe first project for which Sondheim wrote both music and lyrics was ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' (1962, 964 performances), with a book based on the works of [[Plautus]] by [[Burt Shevelove]] and [[Larry Gelbart]], starring [[Zero Mostel]]. Sondheim moved the musical beyond its concentration on the romantic plots typical of earlier eras; his work tended to be darker, exploring the grittier sides of life both present and past. Other early Sondheim works include ''[[Anyone Can Whistle]]'' (1964, which ran only nine performances, despite having stars [[Lee Remick]] and [[Angela Lansbury]]), and the successful ''[[Company (musical)|Company]]'' (1970), ''[[Follies]]'' (1971) and ''[[A Little Night Music]]'' (1973). Later, Sondheim found inspiration in unlikely sources: the opening of [[Japan]] to Western trade for ''[[Pacific Overtures]]'' (1976), a legendary murderous barber seeking revenge in the [[Industrial Revolution|Industrial Age]] of London for ''[[Sweeney Todd (musical)|Sweeney Todd]]'' (1979), the paintings of [[Georges Seurat]] for ''[[Sunday in the Park with George]]'' (1984), fairy tales for ''[[Into the Woods]]'' (1987), and a collection of [[President of the United States|presidential]] assassins in ''[[Assassins (musical)|Assassins]]'' (1990).\n\nWhile some critics have argued that some of Sondheim's musicals lack commercial appeal, others have praised their lyrical sophistication and musical complexity, as well as the interplay of lyrics and music in his shows. Some of Sondheim's notable innovations include a show presented in reverse (''[[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'') and the above-mentioned ''Anyone Can Whistle'', in which the first act ends with the cast informing the audience that they are mad.\n\nJerry Herman played a significant role in American musical theatre, beginning with his first Broadway production, ''[[Milk and Honey (musical)|Milk and Honey]]'' (1961, 563 performances), about the founding of the state of [[Israel]], and continuing with the blockbuster hits ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' (1964, 2,844 performances), ''[[Mame (musical)|Mame]]'' (1966, 1,508 performances), and ''[[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|La Cage aux Folles]]'' (1983, 1,761 performances). Even his less successful shows like ''[[Dear World]]'' (1969) and ''[[Mack and Mabel]]'' (1974) have had memorable scores (''Mack and Mabel'' was later reworked into a London hit). Writing both words and music, many of Herman's [[show tune]]s have become popular standards, including \"[[Hello, Dolly! (song)|Hello, Dolly!]]\", \"We Need a Little Christmas\", \"I Am What I Am\", \"Mame\", \"The Best of Times\", \"Before the Parade Passes By\", \"Put On Your Sunday Clothes\", \"It Only Takes a Moment\", \"Bosom Buddies\" and \"I Won't Send Roses\", recorded by such artists as [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Eydie Gorm\u00e9]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Petula Clark]] and Bernadette Peters. Herman's songbook has been the subject of two popular musical revues, ''[[Jerry's Girls]]'' (Broadway, 1985) and ''[[Showtune]]'' (off-Broadway, 2003).\n{{listen|type=music\n|filename=Aquarius - Let the Sunshine In (song from Hair - sample).ogg\n|title=\"Aquarius\"\n|description=\"Aquarius\", chorus from the original Broadway cast of ''Hair''}}\n\nThe musical started to diverge from the relatively narrow confines of the 1950s. [[Rock music]] would be used in several Broadway musicals, beginning with ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', which featured not only rock music but also nudity and controversial opinions about the [[Vietnam War]], race relations and other social issues.<ref>Wollman, p. 12.</ref>\n\n=== Social themes ===\nAfter ''Show Boat'' and ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'', and as the struggle in America and elsewhere for minorities' [[civil rights]] progressed, Hammerstein, [[Harold Arlen]], [[Yip Harburg]] and others were emboldened to write more musicals and operas that aimed to normalize societal toleration of minorities and urged racial harmony. Early Golden Age works that focused on racial tolerance included ''[[Finian's Rainbow]]'' and ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]''. Towards the end of the Golden Age, several shows tackled Jewish subjects and issues, such as ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'', ''[[Milk and Honey (musical)|Milk and Honey]]'', ''[[Blitz!]]'' and later ''[[Rags (musical)|Rags]]''. The original concept that became ''[[West Side Story]]'' was set in the [[Lower East Side]] during Easter-Passover celebrations; the rival gangs were to be Jewish and [[Italian-American|Italian]] [[Catholic Church|Catholic]]. The creative team later decided that the Polish (white) vs. [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] conflict was fresher.<ref>{{cite news | title = The Growth of an Idea | first = Arthur | last = Laurents | authorlink = Arthur Laurents | url = http://www.leonardbernstein.com/studio/element.asp?FeatID=8&AssetID=18 | work = New York Herald Tribune | publisher = Primate, LLC | date = August 4, 1957 | accessdate = May 26, 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071212040338/http://www.leonardbernstein.com/studio/element.asp?FeatID=8&AssetID=18 | archivedate = December 12, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nTolerance as an important theme in musicals has continued in recent decades. The final expression of ''West Side Story'' left a message of racial tolerance. By the end of the 1960s, musicals became racially integrated, with black and white cast members even covering each other's roles, as they did in ''Hair''.<ref>Horn 1991, p. 134.</ref> Homosexuality has also been explored in musicals, starting with ''Hair'', and even more overtly in ''[[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|La Cage aux Folles]]'', ''[[Falsettos]]'', ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'', ''[[Hedwig and the Angry Inch (musical)|Hedwig and the Angry Inch]]'' and other shows in recent decades. ''[[Parade (musical)|Parade]]'' is a sensitive exploration of both [[anti-Semitism]] and historical American [[racism]], and ''[[Ragtime (musical)|Ragtime]]'' similarly explores the experience of immigrants and minorities in America.\n\n=== 1970s to present ===\n\n==== 1970s ====\n[[File:The Rocky Horror Show Broadway.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Original Broadway poster for ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'']]\nAfter the success of ''Hair'', [[rock musical]]s flourished in the 1970s, with ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'', ''[[Godspell]]'', ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'', ''Evita'' and ''[[Two Gentlemen of Verona (musical)|Two Gentlemen of Verona]]''. Some of those began as \"[[concept album]]s\" which were then adapted to the stage, most notably ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' and ''Evita''. Others had no dialogue or were otherwise reminiscent of opera, with dramatic, emotional themes; these sometimes started as concept albums and were referred to as [[rock opera]]s. Shows like ''[[Raisin (musical)|Raisin]]'', ''[[Dreamgirls (musical)|Dreamgirls]]'', ''[[Purlie]]'' and ''[[The Wiz]]'' brought a significant African-American influence to Broadway. More varied musical genres and styles were incorporated into musicals both on and especially off-Broadway.  At the same time, Stephen Sondheim found success with some of his musicals, as mentioned above.\n\nIn 1975, the dance musical ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' emerged from recorded group therapy-style sessions [[Michael Bennett (theater)|Michael Bennett]] conducted with \"gypsies\"&nbsp;\u2013 those who sing and dance in support of the leading players&nbsp;\u2013 from the Broadway community. From hundreds of hours of tapes, [[James Kirkwood Jr.]] and [[Nick Dante]] fashioned a book about an audition for a musical, incorporating many real-life stories from the sessions; some who attended the sessions eventually played variations of themselves or each other in the show. With music by [[Marvin Hamlisch]] and lyrics by [[Edward Kleban]], ''A Chorus Line'' first opened at [[Joseph Papp]]'s [[Public Theater]] in lower Manhattan. What initially had been planned as a limited engagement eventually moved to the [[Shubert Theatre (Broadway)|Shubert Theatre]] on Broadway<ref>Barnes, Clive.

[[John Kander]] and [[Fred Ebb]] explored the rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany in ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'', and murder and the media in [[Prohibition]]-era ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'', which relied on old [[vaudeville]] techniques. ''[[Pippin (musical)|Pippin]]'', by [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]], was set in the days of [[Charlemagne]]. [[Federico Fellini]]'s autobiographical film ''[[8\u00bd]]'' became [[Maury Yeston]]'s ''[[Nine (musical)|Nine]]''. At the end of the decade, ''Evita'' and ''Sweeney Todd'' were precursors of the darker, big budget musicals of the 1980s that depended on dramatic stories, sweeping scores and spectacular effects. At the same time, old-fashioned values were still embraced in such hits as ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'', ''[[42nd Street (musical)|42nd Street]]'', ''[[My One and Only (musical)|My One and Only]]'', and popular revivals of ''No, No, Nanette'' and ''Irene''.  Although many film versions of musicals were made in the 1970s, few were critical or box office successes, with the notable exceptions of ''[[Fiddler on the Roof (film)|Fiddler on the Roof]]'', ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'' and ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]''.<ref>Kenrick, John.

These typically feature a pop-influenced score, large casts and spectacular sets and special effects \u2013 a falling [[chandelier]] (in ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]''); a helicopter landing on stage (in ''[[Miss Saigon]]'') \u2013 and big budgets. Some were based on novels or other works of literature. The British team of composer [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and producer [[Cameron Mackintosh]] started the megamusical phenomenon with their 1981 musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'', based on the poems of [[T. S. Eliot]], which overtook ''A Chorus Line'' to become the longest-running Broadway show. Lloyd Webber followed up with ''[[Starlight Express]]'' (1984), performed on roller skates; ''The Phantom of the Opera'' (1986; also with Mackintosh), derived from the [[The Phantom of the Opera|novel of the same name]]; and ''[[Sunset Boulevard (musical)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1993), from the 1950 [[Sunset Boulevard (film)|film of the same name]]. ''Phantom'' would surpass ''Cats'' to become the longest-running show in Broadway history, a record it still holds.{{sfn|Everett|Laird|2002|p=250\u2013256}}{{sfn|Allain|Harvie|2014|p=206\u2013207}} The French team of [[Claude-Michel Sch\u00f6nberg]] and [[Alain Boublil]] wrote ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'', based on the [[Les Mis\u00e9rables|novel of the same name]], whose 1985 London production was produced by Mackintosh and became, and still is, the [[Long-running musical theatre productions|longest-running musical in West End and Broadway history]].

In earlier years, it was possible for a show to be considered a hit after a run of several hundred performances, but with multimillion-dollar production costs, a show must run for years simply to turn a profit. Megamusicals were also reproduced in productions around the world, multiplying their profit potential while expanding the global audience for musical theatre.{{sfn|Allain|Harvie|2014|p=206\u2013207}}\n\n==== 1990s ====\n[[File:Audra McDonald (1).jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Audra McDonald]]]]\nIn the 1990s, a new generation of theatrical composers emerged, including [[Jason Robert Brown]] and [[Michael John LaChiusa]], who began with productions Off-Broadway.  The most conspicuous success of these artists was [[Jonathan Larson]]'s show ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' (1996), a rock musical  (based on the opera ''[[La boh\u00e8me]]'') about a struggling community of artists in Manhattan.  While the cost of tickets to Broadway and West End musicals was escalating beyond the budget of many theatregoers, ''Rent'' was marketed to increase the popularity of musicals among a younger audience.  It featured a young cast and a heavily rock-influenced score; the musical became a hit.  Its young fans, many of them students, calling themselves RENTheads], camped out at the [[Nederlander Theatre]] in hopes of winning the lottery for $20 front row tickets, and some saw the show dozens of times.  Other shows on Broadway followed ''Rent'''s lead by offering heavily discounted day-of-performance or standing-room tickets, although often the discounts are offered only to students.<ref>{{cite news | title = Broadway Rush, Lottery and Standing Room Only Policies |url= http://www.playbill.com/celebritybuzz/article/82428-Broadway-Rush-Lottery-and-Standing-Room-Only-Policies| first = Matthew | last = Blank | publisher = PlayBill | date = March 1, 2011|accessdate=March 1, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe 1990s also saw the influence of large corporations on the production of musicals.

Corporate sponsors dominate Broadway, and often alliances are formed to stage musicals, which require an investment of $10&nbsp;million or more. In 2002, the credits for ''[[Thoroughly Modern Millie]]'' listed ten producers, and among those names were entities composed of several individuals.<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=13138 ''Thoroughly Modern Millie''] at the IBDB database</ref> Typically, off-Broadway and regional theatres tend to produce smaller and therefore less expensive musicals, and development of new musicals has increasingly taken place outside of New York and London or in smaller venues. For example, ''Spring Awakening'', ''Fun Home'' and ''Hamilton'' were developed Off-Broadway before being launched on Broadway.\n\nSeveral musicals returned to the spectacle format that was so successful in the 1980s, recalling [[extravaganza]]s that have been presented at times, throughout theatre history, since the ancient Romans staged mock sea battles. Examples include the musical adaptations of ''[[Lord of the Rings (musical)|Lord of the Rings]]'' (2007), ''[[Gone with the Wind (musical)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (2008) and ''[[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark]]'' (2011).  These musicals involved songwriters with little theatrical experience, and the expensive productions generally lost money. Conversely, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'', ''Avenue Q'', ''[[The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee]]'', ''Xanadu'' and ''Fun Home'', among others, have been presented in smaller-scale productions, mostly uninterrupted by an intermission, with short running times, and enjoyed financial success. In 2013, ''Time'' magazine reported that a trend Off-Broadway has been \"immersive\" theatre, citing shows such as ''[[Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812]]'' (2012) and ''[[Here Lies Love]]'' (2013) in which the staging takes place around and within the audience.<ref>Zoglin, Richard.

The story and emotional content of a musical&nbsp;\u2013 humor, [[pathos]], love, anger&nbsp;\u2013 are communicated through words, music, movement and technical aspects of the entertainment as an integrated whole. Although musical theatre overlaps with other theatrical forms like [[opera]] and dance, it may be distinguished by the equal importance given to the music as compared with the dialogue, movement and other elements. Since the early 20th century, musical theatre stage works have generally been called, simply, '''musicals'''.\n\nAlthough music has been a part of dramatic presentations since ancient times, modern Western musical theatre emerged during the 19th century, with many structural elements established by the works of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] in Britain and those of [[Edward Harrigan|Harrigan]] and [[Tony Hart (theater)|Hart]] in America. These were followed by the numerous [[Edwardian musical comedies]] and the musical theatre works of American creators like [[George M. Cohan]] at the turn of the 20th century. The [[Princess Theatre, New York City|Princess Theatre]] musicals (1915\u20131918) and other smart shows like ''[[Of Thee I Sing]]'' (1931) were artistic steps forward beyond [[revue]]s and other frothy entertainments of the early 20th century and led to such groundbreaking works as ''[[Show Boat]]'' (1927) and ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' (1943).  Some of the most famous musicals through the decades that followed include<!-- Please DO NOT ADD new names to the following list.

They may be presented in large venues, such as big-budget [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] or [[West End theatre|West End]] productions in New York City or London. Alternatively, musicals may be staged in smaller venues, such as [[fringe theatre]], [[Off-Broadway]], [[Off-Off-Broadway]], [[Regional theater in the United States|regional theatre]], or [[community theatre]] productions, or [[Touring theatre|on tour]]. Musicals are often presented by [[amateur theatre|amateur and school groups]] in churches, schools and other performance spaces. In addition to the United States and Britain, there are vibrant musical theatre scenes in continental Europe, Asia, Australasia, Canada and Latin America.\n{{TOC limit|4}}\n\n== Definitions and scope ==\n<span id=\"Definitions\"></span>\n\n=== Book musicals ===\n[[File:GaietyGirlDudleyHardy.jpg|thumb|''[[A Gaiety Girl]]'' (1893) was one of the first hit musicals]]\nSince the 20th century, the \"book musical\" has been defined as a musical play where songs and dances are fully integrated into a well-made story with serious dramatic goals that is able to evoke genuine emotions other than laughter.{{sfn|Everett|Laird|2002|p=137}}{{sfn|Rubin|Sol\u00f3rzano|2000|p=438}} The three main components of a book musical are its ''music'', ''lyrics'' and ''book''. The book or [[Script (performing arts)|script]] of a musical refers to the story, character development and dramatic structure, including the spoken dialogue and stage directions, but it can also refer to the dialogue and lyrics together, which are sometimes referred to as the ''[[libretto]]'' (Italian for \"little book\"). The music and lyrics together form the ''[[theatre music|score]]'' of a musical and include songs, [[incidental music]] and musical scenes, which are \"theatrical sequence[s] set to music, often combining song with spoken dialogue.\"<ref name=Continuum>{{cite book |last1=Shepherd |first1=John |last2=Horn |first2=David|year=2012| title=Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Volume 8: Genres: North America |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=__DTvryrBZkC&pg=PA104 |publisher=A&C Black| page=104 |isbn=978-1-4411-4874-2}}</ref> The interpretation of a musical is the responsibility of its creative team, which includes a [[theatre director|director]], a [[musical director]], usually a [[choreographer]] and sometimes an [[orchestrator]]. A musical's production is also creatively characterized by technical aspects, such as [[set design]], [[costume]]s, [[Theatrical property|stage properties (props)]], [[Stage lighting|lighting]] and sound. The creative team, designs and interpretations generally change from the original production to succeeding productions. Some production elements, however, may be retained from the original production, for example, [[Bob Fosse]]'s choreography in ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]''.\n\nThere is no fixed length for a musical. While it can range from a short one-act entertainment to several [[Act (theatre)|acts]] and several hours in length (or even a multi-evening presentation), most musicals range from one and a half to three hours. Musicals are usually presented in two acts, with one short [[intermission]], and the first act is frequently longer than the second. The first act generally introduces nearly all of the characters and most of the music and often ends with the introduction of a dramatic conflict or plot complication while the second act may introduce a few new songs but usually contains reprises of important musical themes and resolves the conflict or complication. A book musical is usually built around four to six main theme tunes that are reprised later in the show, although it sometimes consists of a series of songs not directly musically related. Spoken dialogue is generally interspersed between musical numbers, although \"sung dialogue\" or [[recitative]] may be used, especially in so-called \"[[sung-through]]\" musicals such as ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'', ''[[Falsettos]]'', ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|Les Mis\u00e9rables]]'', ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'' and ''[[Hamilton (musical)|Hamilton]]''. Several shorter musicals on Broadway and in the West End have been presented in one act in recent decades.\n\nMoments of greatest dramatic intensity in a book musical are often performed in song. Proverbially, \"when the emotion becomes too strong for speech, you sing; when it becomes too strong for song, you dance.\"<ref>Wattenberg, Ben. [https://www.pbs.org/thinktank/transcript1261.html ''The American Musical, Part 2''], PBS.org, May 24, 2007, accessed February 7, 2017</ref> In a book musical, a song is ideally crafted to suit the character (or characters) and their situation within the story; although there have been times in the history of the musical (e.g. from the 1890s to the 1920s) when this integration between music and story has been tenuous. As ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[Ben Brantley]] described the ideal of song in theatre when reviewing the 2008 revival of ''[[Gypsy (musical)|Gypsy]]'': \"There is no separation at all between song and character, which is what happens in those uncommon moments when musicals reach upward to achieve their ideal reasons to be.\"<ref>Brantley, Ben. [http://theater2.nytimes.com/2008/03/28/theater/reviews/28gyps.html?pagewanted=all \"Curtain Up! It's Patti's Turn at ''Gypsy''\"], ''The New York Times'', March 28, 2008, accessed May 26, 2009</ref> Typically, many fewer words are sung in a five-minute song than are spoken in a five-minute block of dialogue. Therefore, there is less time to develop drama in a musical than in a straight play of equivalent length, since a musical usually devotes more time to music than to dialogue. Within the compressed nature of a musical, the writers must develop the characters and the plot.\n\nThe material presented in a musical may be original, or it may be adapted from novels (''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'' and ''[[Man of La Mancha]]''), plays (''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' and ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]''), classic legends (''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]''), historical events (''Evita'') or films (''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'' and ''[[Billy Elliot the Musical|Billy Elliot]]''). On the other hand, many successful musical theatre works have been adapted for [[musical film]]s, such as ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'', ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'', ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'', ''[[Oliver! (film)|Oliver!]]'' and ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]''.\n\n=== Comparisons with opera ===\n[[File:George Gershwin 1937.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[George Gershwin]]]]\nMusical theatre is closely related to the theatrical form of [[opera]], but the two are usually distinguished by weighing a number of factors. First, musicals generally have a greater focus on spoken dialogue. Some musicals, however, are entirely accompanied and sung-through, while some operas, such as ''[[Die Zauberfl\u00f6te]]'', and most [[operetta]]s, have some unaccompanied dialogue.  Second, musicals also usually include more dancing as an essential part of the storytelling, particularly by the principal performers as well as the chorus. Third, musicals often use various genres of [[popular music]] or at least popular singing and musical styles.<ref>[[Anthony Tommasini|Tommasini, Anthony]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/10/theater/musical-or-opera-the-fine-line-that-divides-them.html \"Opera? Musical? Please Respect the Difference\"], ''The New York Times'', July 7, 2011, accessed December 13, 2017</ref>\n\nFinally, musicals usually avoid certain operatic conventions. In particular, a musical is almost always performed in the language of its audience. Musicals produced on Broadway or in the West End, for instance, are invariably sung in English, even if they were originally written in another language. While an opera singer is primarily a singer and only secondarily an actor (and rarely needs to dance), a musical theatre performer is often an actor first but must also be a singer and dancer. Someone who is equally accomplished at all three is referred to as a \"triple threat\". Composers of music for musicals often consider the vocal demands of roles with musical theatre performers in mind. Today, large theatres that stage musicals generally use [[microphone]]s and [[sound reinforcement system|amplification]] of the actors' singing voices in a way that would generally be disapproved of in an operatic context.<ref>Gamerman, Ellen.

He experimented with a modern-dress, family-friendly musical theatre style, with breezy, popular songs, snappy, romantic banter, and stylish spectacle at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety]] and his other theatres. These drew on the traditions of comic opera and used elements of burlesque and of the Harrigan and Hart pieces. He replaced the bawdy women of burlesque with his \"respectable\" corps of [[Gaiety Girls]] to complete the musical and visual fun. The success of the first of these, ''[[In Town (musical)|In Town]]'' (1892) and ''[[A Gaiety Girl]]'' (1893) set the style for the next three decades. The plots were generally light, romantic \"poor maiden loves aristocrat and wins him against all odds\" shows, with music by [[Ivan Caryll]], [[Sidney Jones (composer)|Sidney Jones]] and [[Lionel Monckton]]. These shows were immediately widely copied in America, and [[Edwardian musical comedy]] swept away the earlier musical forms of comic opera and operetta. ''[[The Geisha]]'' (1896) was one of the most successful in the 1890s, running for more than two years and achieving great international success.\n\n''[[The Belle of New York (musical)|The Belle of New York]]'' (1898) became the first American musical to run for over a year in London.

The examples they set in creating vital plays, often rich with social thought, provided the necessary encouragement for other gifted writers to create musical plays of their own\".<ref name=history/> The two collaborators created an extraordinary collection of some of musical theatre's best loved and most enduring classics, including ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'' (1945), ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' (1949), ''[[The King and I]]'' (1951) and ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' (1959). Some of these musicals treat more serious subject matter than most earlier shows: the villain in ''Oklahoma!'' is a suspected murderer and psychopath with a fondness for lewd post cards; ''Carousel'' deals with spousal abuse, thievery, suicide and the afterlife; ''South Pacific'' explores miscegenation even more thoroughly than ''Show Boat''; and the hero of ''The King and I'' dies onstage.\n\nThe show's creativity stimulated Rodgers and Hammerstein's contemporaries and ushered in the \"Golden Age\" of American musical theatre.<ref name=Heritage/> Americana was displayed on Broadway during the \"Golden Age\", as the wartime cycle of shows began to arrive. An example of this is ''[[On the Town (musical)|On the Town]]'' (1944), written by [[Betty Comden]] and [[Adolph Green]], composed by [[Leonard Bernstein]] and choreographed by [[Jerome Robbins]]. The story is set during wartime and concerns three sailors who are on a 24-hour shore leave in New York City, during which each falls in love. The show also gives the impression of a country with an uncertain future, as the sailors and their women also have. [[Irving Berlin]] used sharpshooter [[Annie Oakley]]'s career as a basis for his ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'' (1946, 1,147 performances); [[Burton Lane]], [[E. Y. Harburg]] and [[Fred Saidy]] combined political satire with Irish whimsy for their fantasy ''[[Finian's Rainbow]]'' (1947, 725 performances); and Cole Porter found inspiration in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' for ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'' (1948, 1,077 performances). The American musicals overwhelmed the old-fashioned British Coward/Novello-style shows, one of the last big successes of which was Novello's ''[[Perchance to Dream (musical)|Perchance to Dream]]'' (1945, 1,021 performances).  The formula for the Golden Age musicals reflected one or more of four widely held perceptions of the \"American dream\": That stability and worth derives from a love relationship sanctioned and restricted by Protestant ideals of marriage; that a married couple should make a moral home with children away from the city in a suburb or small town; that the woman's function was as homemaker and mother; and that Americans incorporate an independent and pioneering spirit or that their success is self-made.{{sfn|Rubin|Sol\u00f3rzano|2000|pp=439\u2013440}}\n\n==== 1950s ====\n{{Further|Musical film}}\n[[File:JulieAndrews face.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Julie Andrews]]]]\nThe 1950s were crucial to the development of the American musical.<ref>Marks, Peter.

The relatively brief seven-month run of that show didn't discourage [[Lerner and Loewe]] from collaborating again, this time on ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' (1956), an adaptation of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' starring [[Rex Harrison]] and [[Julie Andrews]], which at 2,717 performances held the long-run record for many years. Popular Hollywood films were made of all of these musicals. This surpassed the run of two hits by British creators: ''[[The Boy Friend (musical)|The Boy Friend]]'' (1954), which ran for 2,078 performances in London and marked Andrews' American debut, was very briefly the third longest-running musical in West End or Broadway history (after ''Chu Chin Chow'' and ''Oklahoma!''), until ''[[Salad Days (musical)|Salad Days]]'' (1954) surpassed its run and became the new long-run record holder, with 2,283 performances.<ref name=Salad/>\n\nAnother record was set by ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', which ran for 2,707 performances, becoming the longest-running off-Broadway musical until ''[[The Fantasticks]]''. The production also broke ground by showing that musicals could be profitable off-Broadway in a small-scale, small orchestra format. This was confirmed in 1959 when a revival of [[Jerome Kern]] and [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Leave It to Jane]]'' ran for more than two years. The 1959\u20131960 [[Off-Broadway]] season included a dozen musicals and revues including ''[[Little Mary Sunshine]]'', ''The Fantasticks'' and ''[[Ernest in Love]]'', a musical adaptation of [[Oscar Wilde]]'s 1895 hit ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]''.<ref>Suskin, Steven.

Together with its extremely successful [[The Sound of Music (film)|1965 film version]], it has become one of the most popular musicals in history.\n\n==== 1960s ====\nIn 1960, ''The Fantasticks'' was first produced off-Broadway. This intimate allegorical show would quietly run for over 40 years at the Sullivan Street Theatre in [[Greenwich Village]], becoming by far the longest-running musical in history. Its authors produced other innovative works in the 1960s, such as ''[[Celebration (musical)|Celebration]]'' and ''[[I Do! I Do!]]'', the first two-character Broadway musical. The 1960s would see a number of blockbusters, like ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' (1964; 3,242 performances), ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' (1964; 2,844 performances), ''[[Funny Girl (musical)|Funny Girl]]'' (1964; 1,348 performances) and ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'' (1965; 2,328 performances), and some more risqu\u00e9 pieces like ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'', before ending with the emergence of the [[rock musical]]. Two men had considerable impact on musical theatre history beginning in this decade: [[Stephen Sondheim]] and [[Jerry Herman]].\n\n[[File:Peters in 08.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Bernadette Peters]] (shown in 2008) has starred in five Sondheim musicals]]\nThe first project for which Sondheim wrote both music and lyrics was ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' (1962, 964 performances), with a book based on the works of [[Plautus]] by [[Burt Shevelove]] and [[Larry Gelbart]], starring [[Zero Mostel]]. Sondheim moved the musical beyond its concentration on the romantic plots typical of earlier eras; his work tended to be darker, exploring the grittier sides of life both present and past. Other early Sondheim works include ''[[Anyone Can Whistle]]'' (1964, which ran only nine performances, despite having stars [[Lee Remick]] and [[Angela Lansbury]]), and the successful ''[[Company (musical)|Company]]'' (1970), ''[[Follies]]'' (1971) and ''[[A Little Night Music]]'' (1973). Later, Sondheim found inspiration in unlikely sources: the opening of [[Japan]] to Western trade for ''[[Pacific Overtures]]'' (1976), a legendary murderous barber seeking revenge in the [[Industrial Revolution|Industrial Age]] of London for ''[[Sweeney Todd (musical)|Sweeney Todd]]'' (1979), the paintings of [[Georges Seurat]] for ''[[Sunday in the Park with George]]'' (1984), fairy tales for ''[[Into the Woods]]'' (1987), and a collection of [[President of the United States|presidential]] assassins in ''[[Assassins (musical)|Assassins]]'' (1990).\n\nWhile some critics have argued that some of Sondheim's musicals lack commercial appeal, others have praised their lyrical sophistication and musical complexity, as well as the interplay of lyrics and music in his shows. Some of Sondheim's notable innovations include a show presented in reverse (''[[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'') and the above-mentioned ''Anyone Can Whistle'', in which the first act ends with the cast informing the audience that they are mad.\n\nJerry Herman played a significant role in American musical theatre, beginning with his first Broadway production, ''[[Milk and Honey (musical)|Milk and Honey]]'' (1961, 563 performances), about the founding of the state of [[Israel]], and continuing with the blockbuster hits ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' (1964, 2,844 performances), ''[[Mame (musical)|Mame]]'' (1966, 1,508 performances), and ''[[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|La Cage aux Folles]]'' (1983, 1,761 performances). Even his less successful shows like ''[[Dear World]]'' (1969) and ''[[Mack and Mabel]]'' (1974) have had memorable scores (''Mack and Mabel'' was later reworked into a London hit). Writing both words and music, many of Herman's [[show tune]]s have become popular standards, including \"[[Hello, Dolly! (song)|Hello, Dolly!]]\", \"We Need a Little Christmas\", \"I Am What I Am\", \"Mame\", \"The Best of Times\", \"Before the Parade Passes By\", \"Put On Your Sunday Clothes\", \"It Only Takes a Moment\", \"Bosom Buddies\" and \"I Won't Send Roses\", recorded by such artists as [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Eydie Gorm\u00e9]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Petula Clark]] and Bernadette Peters. Herman's songbook has been the subject of two popular musical revues, ''[[Jerry's Girls]]'' (Broadway, 1985) and ''[[Showtune]]'' (off-Broadway, 2003).\n{{listen|type=music\n|filename=Aquarius - Let the Sunshine In (song from Hair - sample).ogg\n|title=\"Aquarius\"\n|description=\"Aquarius\", chorus from the original Broadway cast of ''Hair''}}\n\nThe musical started to diverge from the relatively narrow confines of the 1950s. [[Rock music]] would be used in several Broadway musicals, beginning with ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', which featured not only rock music but also nudity and controversial opinions about the [[Vietnam War]], race relations and other social issues.<ref>Wollman, p. 12.</ref>\n\n=== Social themes ===\nAfter ''Show Boat'' and ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'', and as the struggle in America and elsewhere for minorities' [[civil rights]] progressed, Hammerstein, [[Harold Arlen]], [[Yip Harburg]] and others were emboldened to write more musicals and operas that aimed to normalize societal toleration of minorities and urged racial harmony. Early Golden Age works that focused on racial tolerance included ''[[Finian's Rainbow]]'' and ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]''. Towards the end of the Golden Age, several shows tackled Jewish subjects and issues, such as ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'', ''[[Milk and Honey (musical)|Milk and Honey]]'', ''[[Blitz!]]'' and later ''[[Rags (musical)|Rags]]''. The original concept that became ''[[West Side Story]]'' was set in the [[Lower East Side]] during Easter-Passover celebrations; the rival gangs were to be Jewish and [[Italian-American|Italian]] [[Catholic Church|Catholic]].

The final expression of ''West Side Story'' left a message of racial tolerance.

''[[Parade (musical)|Parade]]'' is a sensitive exploration of both [[anti-Semitism]] and historical American [[racism]], and ''[[Ragtime (musical)|Ragtime]]'' similarly explores the experience of immigrants and minorities in America.\n\n=== 1970s to present ===\n\n==== 1970s ====\n[[File:The Rocky Horror Show Broadway.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Original Broadway poster for ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'']]\nAfter the success of ''Hair'', [[rock musical]]s flourished in the 1970s, with ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'', ''[[Godspell]]'', ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'', ''Evita'' and ''[[Two Gentlemen of Verona (musical)|Two Gentlemen of Verona]]''. Some of those began as \"[[concept album]]s\" which were then adapted to the stage, most notably ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' and ''Evita''. Others had no dialogue or were otherwise reminiscent of opera, with dramatic, emotional themes; these sometimes started as concept albums and were referred to as [[rock opera]]s. Shows like ''[[Raisin (musical)|Raisin]]'', ''[[Dreamgirls (musical)|Dreamgirls]]'', ''[[Purlie]]'' and ''[[The Wiz]]'' brought a significant African-American influence to Broadway. More varied musical genres and styles were incorporated into musicals both on and especially off-Broadway.  At the same time, Stephen Sondheim found success with some of his musicals, as mentioned above.\n\nIn 1975, the dance musical ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' emerged from recorded group therapy-style sessions [[Michael Bennett (theater)|Michael Bennett]] conducted with \"gypsies\"&nbsp;\u2013 those who sing and dance in support of the leading players&nbsp;\u2013 from the Broadway community. From hundreds of hours of tapes, [[James Kirkwood Jr.]] and [[Nick Dante]] fashioned a book about an audition for a musical, incorporating many real-life stories from the sessions; some who attended the sessions eventually played variations of themselves or each other in the show. With music by [[Marvin Hamlisch]] and lyrics by [[Edward Kleban]], ''A Chorus Line'' first opened at [[Joseph Papp]]'s [[Public Theater]] in lower Manhattan.

[[John Kander]] and [[Fred Ebb]] explored the rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany in ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'', and murder and the media in [[Prohibition]]-era ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'', which relied on old [[vaudeville]] techniques. ''[[Pippin (musical)|Pippin]]'', by [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]], was set in the days of [[Charlemagne]]. [[Federico Fellini]]'s autobiographical film ''[[8\u00bd]]'' became [[Maury Yeston]]'s ''[[Nine (musical)|Nine]]''. At the end of the decade, ''Evita'' and ''Sweeney Todd'' were precursors of the darker, big budget musicals of the 1980s that depended on dramatic stories, sweeping scores and spectacular effects. At the same time, old-fashioned values were still embraced in such hits as ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'', ''[[42nd Street (musical)|42nd Street]]'', ''[[My One and Only (musical)|My One and Only]]'', and popular revivals of ''No, No, Nanette'' and ''Irene''.  Although many film versions of musicals were made in the 1970s, few were critical or box office successes, with the notable exceptions of ''[[Fiddler on the Roof (film)|Fiddler on the Roof]]'', ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'' and ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]''.<ref>Kenrick, John.

Lloyd Webber followed up with ''[[Starlight Express]]'' (1984), performed on roller skates; ''The Phantom of the Opera'' (1986; also with Mackintosh), derived from the [[The Phantom of the Opera|novel of the same name]]; and ''[[Sunset Boulevard (musical)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1993), from the 1950 [[Sunset Boulevard (film)|film of the same name]]. ''Phantom'' would surpass ''Cats'' to become the longest-running show in Broadway history, a record it still holds.{{sfn|Everett|Laird|2002|p=250\u2013256}}{{sfn|Allain|Harvie|2014|p=206\u2013207}} The French team of [[Claude-Michel Sch\u00f6nberg]] and [[Alain Boublil]] wrote ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'', based on the [[Les Mis\u00e9rables|novel of the same name]], whose 1985 London production was produced by Mackintosh and became, and still is, the [[Long-running musical theatre productions|longest-running musical in West End and Broadway history]].

In earlier years, it was possible for a show to be considered a hit after a run of several hundred performances, but with multimillion-dollar production costs, a show must run for years simply to turn a profit. Megamusicals were also reproduced in productions around the world, multiplying their profit potential while expanding the global audience for musical theatre.{{sfn|Allain|Harvie|2014|p=206\u2013207}}\n\n==== 1990s ====\n[[File:Audra McDonald (1).jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Audra McDonald]]]]\nIn the 1990s, a new generation of theatrical composers emerged, including [[Jason Robert Brown]] and [[Michael John LaChiusa]], who began with productions Off-Broadway.  The most conspicuous success of these artists was [[Jonathan Larson]]'s show ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' (1996), a rock musical  (based on the opera ''[[La boh\u00e8me]]'') about a struggling community of artists in Manhattan.  While the cost of tickets to Broadway and West End musicals was escalating beyond the budget of many theatregoers, ''Rent'' was marketed to increase the popularity of musicals among a younger audience.  It featured a young cast and a heavily rock-influenced score; the musical became a hit.  Its young fans, many of them students, calling themselves RENTheads], camped out at the [[Nederlander Theatre]] in hopes of winning the lottery for $20 front row tickets, and some saw the show dozens of times.  Other shows on Broadway followed ''Rent'''s lead by offering heavily discounted day-of-performance or standing-room tickets, although often the discounts are offered only to students.<ref>{{cite news | title = Broadway Rush, Lottery and Standing Room Only Policies |url= http://www.playbill.com/celebritybuzz/article/82428-Broadway-Rush-Lottery-and-Standing-Room-Only-Policies| first = Matthew | last = Blank | publisher = PlayBill | date = March 1, 2011|accessdate=March 1, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe 1990s also saw the influence of large corporations on the production of musicals. The most important has been [[Disney Theatrical Productions]], which began adapting some of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] animated film musicals for the stage, starting with ''[[Beauty and the Beast (musical)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1994), ''[[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]]'' (1997) and ''[[Aida (musical)|Aida]]'' (2000), the latter two with music by [[Elton John]].

The topics of these pieces vary widely, and the music ranges from rock to pop, but they often are produced off-Broadway, or for smaller London theatres, and some of these stagings have been regarded as imaginative and innovative.<ref>{{cite news | title = A glorious musical romp \u2013 with bite! | first = Pete | last = Shaw | url = http://www.broadwaybaby.com/edinburgh/fringe/reviews/batboy | publisher = Broadway Baby | year = 2006 | accessdate = May 26, 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928043409/http://www.broadwaybaby.com/edinburgh/fringe/reviews/batboy | archivedate = September 28, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==== 2000s\u20132010s ====\n===== Trends =====\nIn the new century, familiarity has been embraced by producers and investors anxious to guarantee that they recoup their considerable investments.

This trend is especially persistent with film adaptations, including (''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'', ''[[Spamalot]]'', ''[[Hairspray (musical)|Hairspray]]'', ''[[Legally Blonde (musical)|Legally Blonde]]'', ''[[The Color Purple (musical)|The Color Purple]]'', ''[[Xanadu (musical)|Xanadu]]'', ''[[Billy Elliot the Musical|Billy Elliot]]'', ''[[Shrek (musical)|Shrek]]'', ''[[Waitress (musical)|Waitress]]'' and ''[[Groundhog Day (musical)|Groundhog Day]]'').<ref>Berman, Eliza. \"On Broadway, It's D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu All Over \u2013 and Not Just for ''Groundhog Day'', ''Time'' magazine, May 15, 2017 issue, pp. 51\u201352</ref> Some critics have argued that the reuse of film plots, especially those from Disney (such as ''[[Mary Poppins (musical)|Mary Poppins]]'' and ''[[The Little Mermaid (musical)|The Little Mermaid]]''), equate the Broadway and West End musical to a tourist attraction, rather than a creative outlet.<ref name=Kenrick/>\n\n[[File:Obama greets the cast and crew of Hamilton musical, 2015.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.35|The cast of ''[[Hamilton (musical)|Hamilton]]'' meets President Obama in 2015]]\nToday, it is less likely that a sole producer, such as [[David Merrick]] or [[Cameron Mackintosh]], backs a production. Corporate sponsors dominate Broadway, and often alliances are formed to stage musicals, which require an investment of $10 million or more. In 2002, the credits for ''[[Thoroughly Modern Millie]]'' listed ten producers, and among those names were entities composed of several individuals.<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=13138 ''Thoroughly Modern Millie''] at the IBDB database</ref> Typically, off-Broadway and regional theatres tend to produce smaller and therefore less expensive musicals, and development of new musicals has increasingly taken place outside of New York and London or in smaller venues. For example, ''Spring Awakening'', ''Fun Home'' and ''Hamilton'' were developed Off-Broadway before being launched on Broadway.\n\nSeveral musicals returned to the spectacle format that was so successful in the 1980s, recalling [[extravaganza]]s that have been presented at times, throughout theatre history, since the ancient Romans staged mock sea battles. Examples include the musical adaptations of ''[[Lord of the Rings (musical)|Lord of the Rings]]'' (2007), ''[[Gone with the Wind (musical)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (2008) and ''[[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark]]'' (2011).  These musicals involved songwriters with little theatrical experience, and the expensive productions generally lost money. Conversely, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'', ''Avenue Q'', ''[[The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee]]'', ''Xanadu'' and ''Fun Home'', among others, have been presented in smaller-scale productions, mostly uninterrupted by an intermission, with short running times, and enjoyed financial success. In 2013, ''Time'' magazine reported that a trend Off-Broadway has been \"immersive\" theatre, citing shows such as ''[[Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812]]'' (2012) and ''[[Here Lies Love]]'' (2013) in which the staging takes place around and within the audience.<ref>Zoglin, Richard.

They are a special type of very low-power [[smoothbore]] [[airgun]]s designed to shoot [[airsoft pellets|non-metallic spherical projectiles]] often colloquially (but incorrectly) referred to as \"[[BB (ammunition)|BB]]s\", which are typical\nmuzzle energy]] ratings (generally less than 1.5 [[Joule|J]], or 1.1 [[Foot-pound (energy)|ft\u22c5lb]]) and the pellets have significantly less [[penetration (weaponry)|penetrative]] and [[stopping power]]s than conventional airguns, and are generally safe for [[competitive sport]]ing and [[recreation]]al purposes if proper [[protective gear]] is worn.\n\nDepending on the design mechanism for pellet propulsion, airsoft guns can be categorized into two groups: mechanical, which consists of a [[coil spring]]-loaded [[piston pump|piston]] [[air pump]] that is either manually cocked (e.g. spring guns) or automatically cycled by a [[electric battery|battery]]-powered [[electric motor]] [[gearbox]] (e.g. AEGs); and [[pneumatic]], which operates by valve-controlled release of prefilled [[bottled gas]] such as [[compressed gas|compressed]] [[propane]] mixed with [[silicone oil]] (commonly known as \"Green Gas\") or [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] canisters (e.g. GBB guns).\n\nAs toy weapons, airsoft guns can often be designed to realistically resemble genuine firearms in external appearance, and it can be very difficult to visually distinguish from one despite the orange muzzle tips in some jurisdictions.  However, regardless of the cosmetic resemblance, airsoft guns cannot be functionally modified into real firearms due to its construction and design.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://airsoft-facts.com/airsoft-equipment-1|title=Airsoft Equipment|website=airsoft-facts.com|access-date=2018-04-06|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407182608/http://airsoft-facts.com/airsoft-equipment-1|archivedate=2018-04-07}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Usage ==\n[[File:Systema ptw01.jpg|thumbnail|[[Systema Engineering|Systema]] Professional Training Weapon System M4A1 MAX]]\n[[File:Flickr - The U.S. Army - Airsoft adds hard edge to combat training.jpg|thumb|Soldiers with the [[US Army]] 187th Ordnance Battalion prepared to clear a room during urban combat training at the battalion's Field Training Exercise site.

Airsoft guns also allow basic and advanced shooter training in a safer environment by reducing the risks of accidental injury or death from a [[negligent discharge]].\n\nThere are clubs, teams and even athletic associations devoted to airsoft events around the world. Europe is home to some of the largest events, with skirmishes of over 2,000 people participating. In North America, in 2012 alone, [[Fulda Gap]] Airsoft Game in [[Taylorsville, North Carolina]] had over 1,100 participants, and Operation Lion Claws Military Simulation Series (OLCMSS) had 800 people attend at [[George Air Force Base]] in [[Victorville, California]]. American Mil-sim, Black Sheep, and Ballahack also host large games. The attraction of the larger games is due to the intensity and variety in equipment that is used, ranging from small arms to armored vehicles.\n\nIn many countries, every airsoft gun owner and active enthusiast must be affiliated with an accredited airsoft association or federation. Most airsoft players host games at a registered field where combat situations are simulated using airsoft weaponry like replica [[pistol]]s, [[submachine guns]], [[carbine]]s/[[assault rifle]]s, [[designated marksman rifle|DMR]]s/[[sniper rifle]]s, [[light machine gun]]s, [[grenade]]s and [[landmine]]s. Great variety and profusion of [[militaria]] is usually used. [[Historical reenactment]] of famous war situations is another favorite of many airsoft players and clubs. In addition, a number of companies such as [[Systema Engineering]] and Celsius Technology manufacture ultra-realistic high-velocity airsoft rifles designed specifically for the police and military for non-lethal training purposes. People today can also use it as [[Theatrical property|props]] for [[film making]].\n\n== Types ==\n\n=== Spring-powered ===\n'''Spring-powered airsoft guns''' (or \"'''air-cocking guns'''\" as called by [[Tokyo Marui]]) are [[single-shot]] devices that use the [[elastic potential energy]] stored within a compressed [[coil spring]] to drive a [[piston pump|piston air pump]], which is released upon trigger-pull and rapidly pressurizes the air within the pump cylinder to in turn \"blow\" pellets down the [[gun barrel]].  These guns are almost identical (though simplified and underpowered) in design to [[air gun#Spring-piston|spring-piston air gun]]s and have the same operation principles. The user must manually recompress the spring under [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] prior to each shot, typically by pulling back the [[pistol slide|slide]] (pistols), [[cocking handle|bolt handle]] (rifles) or [[pump action|forend pump]] (shotguns) on the weapon, which cocks and readies the gun.  Because of this, spring guns are incapable of [[automatic firearm|automatic]] or [[semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] firing by design.\n\nSpring-powered airsoft guns are generally not as powerful as gas-powered ones, but are more powerful than electric airsoft guns because stiffer springs can often be used without the worry of overloading any motor-gearbox, although some spring [[shotgun]]s and [[bolt-action rifle]]s can be very powerful with [[muzzle velocity|muzzle velocities]] up to {{convert|400|\u2013|700|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. Spring guns are generally inexpensive (except the high-power sniper rifles and shotguns), and may not last long (depending on the build quality) due to the tension exerted on the gun parts by the recoiling of a powerful spring. However, many spring guns can be modified and upgraded to last longer and shoot more powerfully.\n\nWhile most electric airsoft guns also use springs to drive the air pump and propel the pellets, they use external power sources and are not considered to be in the same category as the single-shot manual spring guns. Low-end spring guns tend to be much cheaper than their electric equivalents due to their simplicity and lack of electrical components ([[electric motor]]/[[actuator]], spring-[[gearbox]] assembly, as well as battery and battery charger) and thus are widely available. These guns are less suited for competition because they are at a rate-of-fire disadvantage against automatic guns in close combat and do not provide enough accuracy and power for long-range use. There are some exceptions, however, as higher-end spring-powered airsoft rifles can be quite expensive; these guns are typically suited for \"marksman\" applications in airsoft matches and provide competitive muzzle velocities. Additionally, pump shotguns are sometimes used for both short and longer range engagements. In colder weather, spring pistols are more reliable than gas-powered pistols and even the batteries on automatic electric pistols (AEPs) both of which can be adversely affected by extreme low temperatures. This represents one of the major advantages of spring airsoft gun, as it can be fired in practically any situations without relying on [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] or [[bottled gas]]. This independence from external power sources causes some players to favor spring-powered guns. Spring guns are also less susceptible to the effects of water, where a battery-powered gun could [[short-circuit]] and malfunction when wet.\n\nSpring-powered weapons are often cheaper than electric or gas-powered weapons. They are also more readily available in most department stores.  Because of their low price, availability and simplicity, spring guns tend to act as \"training guns\" to bring new players to airsoft games and are considered the primary weapon of \"backyard skirmishes\". In the UK, they are affectionately known as \"springers\" and were often a player's introduction to the sport due to the entry-level cost in comparison to AEG and GBB weapons. Almost all airsoft players at some point owned a spring weapon, whether for its actual use in a competitive event or for the replica value since some airsoft weapons are only available as spring versions. However, some veteran airsoft players still rely on [[sniper rifle]] and [[shotgun]]-type spring guns as a primary weapon due to their reliability, high power, high accuracy and low noise, as well as their ease of repair and modification compared to AEGs and GBB guns.\n\nTo be eligible to purchase an airsoft gun in the United States, a person has to be of at least 18 years of age.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://airsofthow.com/where-is-airsoft-legal/|title=Legal Issues of Airsoft|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Battery-powered {{anchor|Electric guns}}===\n====Automatic electric guns====\n[[File:AEG.gif|thumb|left|An illustration of the working of a Version 2 electric motor gearbox]]\n[[File:Bi-3681.jpg|thumb|left|A Dboys M4A1 AEG]]\n[[File:Customised ARES L85.jpg|Customised ARES L85|thumb|left|An ARES L85 AEG customised with a Daniel Defense [[Rail Integration System|rail interface system]], replica [[Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight|ACOG]] sight, Grip Pod and [[Magpul]] PTS EMAG.]]\nElectrically powered airsoft guns use a spring-loaded piston pump just like spring guns, but instead of manual operation they typically use portable [[rechargeable battery|rechargeable]] [[battery pack]]s to power an internal [[electric motor]], which transmit through a [[gearbox]] to compress the pump spring and propel/load the pellets in a cyclic fashion. [[Selective fire]] options among [[automatic firearm|automatic]], 3-round [[burst fire|burst]] and [[semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] operations are all possible, which gives these guns the popular name \"'''automatic electric guns'''\", or '''AEGs'''.<ref name=\"airsplat\">{{cite web|url=http://www.airsplat.com/airsoft-definition.htm|title=Airsoft Guide and Information - What is Airsoft?|website=www.airsplat.com|accessdate=May 9, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119041212/http://www.airsplat.com/airsoft-definition.htm|archivedate=January 19, 2015}}</ref> These guns often attain muzzle velocities from {{convert|150|to|650|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} and [[rate of fire|rates of fire]] (RoF) between 100 and 1500 rounds per minute. They are the most commonly used and widely available type of airsoft gun.\n\nThe AEGs were developed in [[Japan]] and the Japanese company [[Tokyo Marui]] is credited with creating the original gearbox system. In a Tokyo Marui AEG, the motor drives a [[gear train|train]] of three [[gears]] mounted inside a gearbox, which then loads a pump piston against a spring. Once the spring is released, it pushes the piston plunger forward through the pump cylinder to propel a pellet resting within the [[chamber (firearms)|chamber]] forward through the barrel and out of the [[muzzle (firearms)|muzzle]]. Many manufacturers have now more or less replicated this basic model, adding reinforced parts or minor improvements.\n\nThe electric airsoft guns were powered primarily by [[nickel-metal hydride]] (NiMH) batteries with varying [[voltage]]s and [[milliampere-hour]] ratings. The most common battery is an 8.4&nbsp;V large [[battery pack]], with a capacity between 2200 and 5000 mAh. Also available are \"mini\" and \"stick\" batteries, which generally have 900 ~ 1600&nbsp;mAh capacities. Voltages for NiMH batteries range from 7.2&nbsp;V to 12&nbsp;V. The usual rule of thumb is that the higher the mAh rating, the longer the battery lasts; the higher the voltage, the higher the rate of fire.<ref name=\"BatteryLord\">{{in lang|en}}  {{cite web | title=How to Calculate Airsoft Battery Pack Recharge Time | year=2013 | work=www.batterylord.com | url=http://www.batterylord.com/index.php?route=information/information&information_id=15 | accessdate=2013-04-22 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020092953/http://www.batterylord.com/index.php?route=information%2Finformation&information_id=15 | archivedate=2013-10-20 }}</ref> Recently, however, the more energy-dense [[lithium polymer]] (Li-Po) batteries are becoming more popular in the airsoft world, since they last longer, have higher mAh and voltages, and can be charged more frequently without concerns for [[voltage depression]], while at the same time being small and lightweight. Li-Po batteries are usually rated at 7.4&nbsp;V or 11.1&nbsp;V, and varying between 500&nbsp;mAh and 6500&nbsp;mAh.\n\nExternal modifications, such as metal bodies and reinforced plastics that make AEGs look and feel even more realistic, have become very popular.  AEG manufacturers such as [[Classic Army]] and [[Tokyo Marui]] produce replicas that are visually nearly identical to their real counterparts. [[Tokyo Marui]] uses an [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] plastic, whereas [[Classic Army]] features full metal bodied guns and stronger furnishings. Most AEGs produced as of late are designed to be as visually realistic as possible.\n\nThe three most common AEGs on the field are the [[AR-15 variants|AR-15 series]] (such as [[M16 rifle]], [[M4 carbine]], etc.; sometimes referred to as the [[ArmaLite]] or [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] series), the [[Heckler & Koch|H&K]] [[Heckler & Koch MP5|MP5]] series, and the [[AK47|AK or Kalashnikov]] series. Also increasing popular is the [[Heckler & Koch G36|H&K G36]] and more recently, [[FN Herstal|FN]] [[FN P90|P90]] and [[Heckler & Koch MP7|H&K MP7]].  Subsequently, numerous parts for repairs and modifications are commonly available for these rifles. AEG models range from a simple pistol to a [[rocket propelled grenade]] all the way to a [[minigun]].\n\n====Low powered electric guns====\n[[File:Kwa boys commando.jpg|thumb|right|Dboys selective fire \"Boys\" Colt ninja electric rifle, approx. 3/4 scale, pictured with .12 gram Crosman ammunition and Cybergun]]\nSome airsoft guns are called ''low powered electric guns'' (LPEGs) to distinguish them from the original, more expensive and more powerful AEGs even though their mechanical/electrical design and operation is similar. They are not to be confused with ''[[#Mini electrics|mini electrics]]'' (described below). Originally they were only of novelty value, often regarded below spring-operated guns due to their construction and low velocities. Since there are spring action guns that can notably outperform the true low-end LPEGs and can be found at comparable prices, they are generally considered to be better choices.\n\n====Medium price electric guns====\nSome companies \u2013 like UTG with their popular [[Heckler & Koch MP5|MP5]] and [[AK-47]] models \u2013 have improved their quality to such an extent that some models are now considered simply as mid-ranged AEGs that are more affordable but still reasonably effective. Among airsofters, these are commonly called middle priced electric guns (MPEGs). Sometimes, MPEGs are copies or 'clones' of designs by full-price manufacturers like Tokyo Marui.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}  As of late 2008 a small number of MPEG brands such as Echo-1/Jing Gong, and CYMA are considered by many to approach the quality and match the performance of the originals, at less than half the price. \"Fully compatible\" MPEGs imitate the Marui or Classic Army originals so precisely that standard upgrade parts will work with them, making it possible to hot-rod an MPEG to well beyond stock out-of-the-box AEG performance.\n\n====Electric blowbacks====\nElectric blowbacks, also known as EBBs, are high-end AEGs which generally run from a rechargeable 9.6 volt battery. Most models utilizing this system are rifles. EBBs simulate the blowback action of a real pistol or rifle but generally have less of a kick. Essentially an AEG in design, EBBs are just as powerful. However, a drawback to having the blowback feature is that the battery is quickly depleted, additionally blowbacks can cause extra stress on the gear box which may result in the gearbox's shorter life span. The blowback system can be disabled with some tinkering.\n\nElectric blowback can also refer to a feature in some higher-end guns which offers more realistic operation. Companies such as G&G<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.airsofthow.com/top-10-best-airsoft-guns/|title=Best Airsoft Guns|last=|first=|date=|website=AirsoftHow|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> now offer guns such as the combat machine M4 and the combat machine \"RK47\" which has moving parts linked directly to the main mechanism of the gun, such as the bolt. Echo 1 has recently released a Blowback MP5SD. Also, APS (Accuracy Pneumatics Shooting) makes EBB M4A1, M4 Commando, and the AK47. The M4s also have three others with an RIS unit. These weapons perform identically to similar non-blowback offerings, with the added realism of reciprocating bolts and some recoil. Most models incorporate pneumatic blowback systems but some feature mechanical systems.\n\n====Mini electrics====\nRecently, the company Well, well known for its spring guns, began manufacturing a range of battery-powered guns in miniature size that fire only full automatic. They differ from GPMGs in that they are not replicas of real firearms, being miniaturized version of real firearms, mostly made of black or clear plastic.\n\nThey have a small bb capacity, usually between 50 and 100 rounds, but they have fair range and a functional hop-up. They have become very popular in recent years, and are now being manufactured by Tokyo Marui. These \u201cminis,\u201d as they are referred to, are not a viable option in games against AEGs since their small ammo capacity, short range and poor far range accuracy leave their wielder at a large disadvantage.  Mini electric guns are able to compete with spring pistols at close ranges however, primarily due to their higher rate of fire.\n\n====Automatic electric pistols====\nAutomatic electric pistols, abbreviated AEPs, were first introduced by [[Tokyo Marui]] in 2005 with their [[Glock 18#Variants|Glock 18C]] (followed later by a [[Beretta 93R]] model). They were the first handguns to incorporate an electrically powered system that is capable of fully automatic operation.\n\nIn cold weather, AEPs are often considered better sidearms than gas powered pistols, because batteries are not as badly affected by frigid weather. Gases like CO<sub>2</sub> and [[green gas]] are stored in liquid form and require heat in order to vaporize. A gas pistol at {{convert|10|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} will usually only get one to two usable shots from a full magazine, and even will be at reduced power because of the lowered pressure of the gas.\n\nBecause the AEP gearbox and battery are smaller, the velocity of AEP BBs (usually between 200 and {{convert|280|ft/s|m/s|1|abbr=on}}) is relatively slow by the standards of airsoft simulations, rendering them useful only for close-range simulation. However, the advanced hop up units on these new guns tend to compensate for the low power and can produce an effective range comparable to those of an AEG. CYMA has made a clone Glock 18C, which is a lower priced alternative.\n\nAn AEP differs from electric blow-backs because the AEP has a fixed slide (in which there is no external movement of the slide during operation), while an EBB simulates the \"blow back\" action in the slide experienced in a real pistol or Gas Blow Back (GBB). An AEP, however, has much more power and accuracy.\n\nOne of the newer AEP-styled guns is the Marui replica of the Heckler & Koch [[MP7]]. It is considerably larger than either of the other guns, and can be upgraded to a much higher power through the use of an external battery, but uses the same system as the AEP, so the classification is ambiguous. It is slightly more powerful than the others and is a suitable choice for [[CQB]] (Close Quarter Battle) games due to its small size and decent barrel- to gun-length ratio.\n\nSome [[semi-automatic pistol]]s can be modified to be automatic pistols. To make them more effective, they use rechargeable batteries supplied with the gun, and can be replaced with a larger battery to make their [[Rate of fire|ROF]] higher.\n\nDue to restrictions on size, either the electric motor or batteries have to occupy space in the hand grip, reducing the available space for a magazine. Because of this, most AEPs do not use a full size magazine found in most gas powered pistols.\n\nIn addition, most AEPs are constructed almost entirely of plastic and have a light, toy-like feeling to them.\n\n=== Gas-powered ===\n* '''Gas blowback'''\n[[File:USP Compact on flecktarn.JPG|200px|thumb|right|A gas blowback [[Heckler & Koch USP#USP Compact|Heckler & Koch USP Compact]] replica, made by KSC.]]\nGas-powered airsoft guns use the [[pneumatic]] [[potential energy]] stored within [[compressed gas]] to drive the shooting mechanism, and thus operate according to an entirely different design principle to spring- or electrically powered airsoft guns.  The most common type seen is the '''gas blowback''' ('''GBB''') guns.  These gas guns use an internal [[gas cylinder|canister]] (usually within the [[magazine (firearms)|magazine]]) that upon trigger-pull releases the prefilled [[bottled gas]] via a series of valves to propel the pellet and generate a [[blowback (firearms)|blowback]], which simulates [[recoil]] and cyclically loads the next shot.  They are capable of both automatic and semi-automatic operation.\n\nThe most common gases<ref name=\"gas\" /> used are \"[[green gas]]\" and [[propane]] which requires an adaptor. [[HFC-134a]] is also commonly used, particularly with pistols which have plastic sliders due to the lower pressure giving a smaller chance of damage to the weaker slide. Less commonly used gases include \"red gas\" (which is actually [[HCFC-22]]), [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] and [[nitrogen]]/high-pressure air. However it is unlawful to use HCFC-22 as a propellant in the US, as it is a Class II [[ozone-depleting substance]] and its use as an aerosol propellant has been banned since January 1994 under section 610(d) of Clean Air Act.<ref name=\"epa\" /> Red gas is usually avoided unless the airsoft gun has undergone modification, as its relatively high critical pressure can cause damage to the airsoft gun, such as breakage of the slide or bolt. CO<sub>2</sub>, nitrogen, and high pressure air are less common because they need to be stored at higher pressures than \"green gas\" or HFC-134a.\n\nThe first ever gas powered airsoft guns were commonly referred to as \"classic\" guns, owing to their age. These guns were most commonly powered by liquid propellants such as [[Dichlorodifluoromethane|R-12]] (which was marketed by the Japanese as FLON-12 or [[DuPont]] tradename Freon 12) [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]] feeding system with a majority of the configurations containing two tanks, one containing the R-12 and one used as an expansion tank, and the gun itself.  R-12 was a commonly used refrigerant for car air conditioning and refrigerators, and is considered a highly potent ozone-depleting substance and listed as a Class I Ozone Depleting Substance by the US EPA.  Its use as a general purpose aerosol propellant has been banned by the US EPA since March 1978 under 43 FR 11301 for use in aerosol use with a very few exceptions.<ref name=\"epa1\" />  Its use is also banned in many countries under United Nations treaties.  On December 31, 2008, the use of CFCs for medical inhalers were banned.\n\nLater users modified these old guns to be powered by regulated CO<sub>2</sub> canisters or nitrogen/high pressure air bottles to increase power and consistency. However, these guns have largely been superseded by the newer and more versatile AEGs, or automatic electric guns. One of the reasons for this is because the most commonly available propellant, R-12, is costly. Additionally, at high flow rates, liquid propellants tend to cool down, eventually freezing. As cooldown progresses, the rate of fire gradually decreases until the gun ceases operation. The user would then be forced to wait for the propellant to warm up again. CO<sub>2</sub> is not affected as badly by this tendency, and nitrogen/high pressure air is immune to it. Furthermore, if liquid propellant is introduced into the gun's mechanism, rubber parts can freeze and eventually damage the gun. However, it is unlikely for this to occur since once the gas is released from the containing cylinder it instantly turns back into its gaseous state, and expands rapidly. It is doubtful whether the retained pressure behind the BB before it begins to accelerate down the barrel is enough to keep the gas in a liquid form. Also, any gun that is expected to be exposed to the intense cold of de-pressurizing gas should have materials that can handle it.\n\nGas power tends to be used in airsoft pistols where size constraints make electric-powered mechanisms impractical. Other instances where gas is favored are where adjustable velocities are required or where a blowback feature is desired. A blowback feature is a mechanism which cycles a slide or bolt to better simulate a real firearm's operation. Because of the mechanical complexities involved with distributing and regulating gas, these guns have largely given way to electric guns for less specialized applications, however, they still remain favorable amongst most airsofters. They are not just limited to pistols; submachine guns, sniper rifles and assault rifles commonly use gas mechanisms. Whilst the submachine gun replicas typically feature a blowback mechanism similar to the pistol replicas, sniper rifle replicas usually omit the blowback mechanism in favor of reduced [[recoil]] and increased muzzle velocity.\n\nAlong with using gas to power guns, it is also applied for use in replica grenades. These grenades are either projectiles, fired from a grenade launcher such as the [[M203]] or [[GP-30|GP-25]], or throwable. The shells work on the system of an internal piston, filled with gas. Either a series of BB's or in some cases a rubber or soft foam head is seated in or on top of the shell. When the pressure is released the projectile(s) are shot from the launcher sent downrange.\n\nIn the case of the throwable grenades, inside the grenade there is a similar piston to the one used in the shells, but is on a literal \"timer\" that allows the user to clear the area of effect. BB's or powder act as the projectile in the case of these grenades. Currently both types of grenades are not very common, mostly because grenade launchers are quite expensive and the throwable grenades are not very reliable.\n\n* '''High pressure air systems'''\n'''High pressure air''' ('''HPA''') systems are a type of pneumatic airsoft weapon that use externally supplied high pressure air instead of internal gas canisters like the majority of gas-operated airsoft guns.  They work by using a separate high-pressure [[Pressure vessel|air tank]] that is connected to the airsoft gun with a hose, which is connected with a [[pneumatic motor]] inside the gun (called an \"engine\") at where the gearbox would be in a normal electric airsoft gun.  The engine is powered by a fire control unit that can adjust to the desired rates of fire as well as the [[Timing light|dwell]] that determines how much air is released with each individual shot.  There are several types of HPA systems and they vary in both price and performance. Popular HPA brands and engines include PolarStar (Fusion Engine, F1, Jack), Wolverine (Hydra, Bolt, Inferno, Wraith, SMP), Valken (V12), and Tippmann (M4 Carbine)\n\nIt is not definitive which style is more effective. It is more up to personal preference.\n\n=== Hybrid guns ===\nHybrid airsoft guns are the newest type of airsoft guns on the market.  They are basically standard AEGs or GBB guns with a \"little extra reality\" built in, and are usually more powerful.\n* '''AEG hybrid operation''': The magazine is loaded with shell cases, each containing a single plastic pellet.  These shell casings can have a small red cap, the same as those found in any child's toy [[cap gun]] placed on the top of them.  These hybrid guns feature an electrically powered, full blowback system and operate on a \"round-per-shell\" basis such that for every pellet fired, a shell casing is ejected and the cap is fired providing a realistic sound and smoke effect.  Since its debut, the only hybrid guns seen on the market are TOP M4A1, as well as [[M1 Garand]], [[Kar98]], and other rifle models.  These guns are the least common type of gun on the market today and are generally used by collectors and re-enactors rather than skirmishers.\n*  '''Gas blowback hybrid operation''': Hybrid gas blowback airsoft guns are quite similar with hybrid AEGs and their operations are similar with ordinary gas blowback airsoft guns.  A single 6&nbsp;mm pellet is still loaded to a shell casing.  Then it is placed into a magazine.  The airsoft replica itself also has a tank for compressed gas as propellant (such as [[green gas]]).  So as the [[slide (firearms)|slide]]/[[bolt (firearms)|bolt]] is pulled back, it loads a shell into the chamber.  As the trigger is pulled, it releases a small burst of propellant and the pellet is forced out the barrel.\n\n=== Training weapons ===\n[[File:CELCIUS CTW (M4A1 replica).JPG|thumb|right|An airsoft gun made by {{notatypo|Celcius}} Technology (Hong Kong).  This training weapon model is a replica of the [[M4A1]] and also has a G&G [[Trijicon]] [[Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight|ACOG]] scope replica.]]\nAirsoft gun manufacturer [[Systema Engineering]] (PTW) developed a line of airsoft guns and accessories intended for military and law enforcement training. These airsoft guns are made of aircraft-grade [[aluminum]] combined with [[stainless steel]] parts that gives strength, stability, weather protection, and easy maintenance.  These training weapons offer a more realistic display of military weapons. Unfortunately they have been plagued by reliability problems and parts availability.  They have also had models banned from the US for being capable of being converted into real firearms.  Two manufactures, King Arms and KWA, came out with [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]]-approved gas blowback [[AR-15]] replicas that allowed for correct weapons tear down, manipulation and function that were designed for military use, but were also legal for US citizens to own. The King Arms model required upgrade parts out of the parts to give it reliability, though the KWA was plagued by a weak [[hop-up (airsoft)|hop-up]] system, but otherwise reliable.\n\nIn November 5, 2018, the [[United States Coast Guard]], which has long used the [[.40 S&W|.40 caliber]] [[SIG P229]] as its duty sidearm, announced that it will acquire the SIG ProForce P229 CO<sub>2</sub> airsoft pistol (which was then produced under [[brand licensing]] by French [[airsoft]] manufacturer CyberGun, before SIG later ceased external licensing and took over the production in early 2019) as its new training pistol to give cadets and guardsmen the ability to practice gun handling, conduct target practice in various environments, and train in realistic force-on-force scenarios.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.military.com/kitup/2018/11/05/coast-guard-buys-sig-p229-airsoft-clone-its-new-training-sidearm.html|title=Coast Guard Buys Sig P229 Airsoft Clone as Its New Training Sidearm|author=Matthew Cox|publisher=Military.com|date=2018-11-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2018/11/05/coast-guard-airsoft-gun/|title=US Coast Guard Pick SIG P229 Airsoft Pistol for Training|author=Matthew Moss|publisher=The Firearm Blog|date=2019-02-04}}</ref>\n\n== Performance ==\nAirsoft guns shoot [[Airsoft pellets|plastic pellets]] at velocities from {{convert|30|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}} for a low-end spring pistol, to {{convert|200|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}} for heavily upgraded customized sniper rifles. Most non-upgraded AEGs are in the middle, producing velocities from {{convert|90|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}} to {{convert|120|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}}. The internal components of most guns can be upgraded which can increase the pellet velocity significantly. Using heavier pellets (.25&nbsp;g, .3&nbsp;g, etc.) will significantly reduce the gun's muzzle velocity, but can increase accuracy at range and reduce susceptibility to wind drift. Lighter pellets have less kinetic energy than their heavier pellets, despite their higher exit velocity. Decreasing the pellet's weight does not generally increase its range.\n\nA common upgrade done by players is in the \"[[hop-up (airsoft)|hop-up]]\" system, featured in most mid- to high-end AEG's, as well as gas guns and spring sniper rifles.  In this system, the wall of a rubber tube, called a bucking, is forced into the upper path of the pellet right before it begins flying down the inner barrel.  This contact imparts [[backspin]], which in turn gives the pellet a [[Magnus effect|Magnus]] [[lift (force)|lift]] to maintain a flatter trajectory for a longer period of time.  This is adjusted by screws or gears that cause the bucking to only show a small or large presence in the barrel.  Different degrees of firmness of the rubber are considered when a hop-up is being upgraded.\n\n== Safety concerns ==\n{{See also|Legal issues in airsoft}}\nAirsoft is safe when played with proper protective gear.  Most airsoft guns on the market are usually below {{convert|350|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}, but projectiles expelled from any type of airsoft gun can travel as slow as {{convert|65|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} to more than {{convert|700|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} and are capable of breaking skin at {{convert|350-400|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. For example, skirmish play in the United Kingdom has a maximum of 350&nbsp;ft/s, with some airsoft locations having a limit as low as 290&nbsp;ft/s.<ref>{{cite web|title=United Kingdom Airsoft Rules and Laws |url=http://spraythemag.co.uk/2015/11/03/united-kingdom-airsoft-rules-and-laws/ |accessdate=December 17, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419030027/http://spraythemag.co.uk/2015/11/03/united-kingdom-airsoft-rules-and-laws/ |archivedate=April 19, 2016 }}</ref> If under {{convert|300|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}, the hit would have to be within a short range. Blood can be drawn, but injuries that do occur are predominantly superficial. Full-seal protective eyewear (goggles or glasses) is widely considered the minimum protection for airsoft players, as the eyes may be injured by any type of impact. The least amount of protection a player should seek will meet or exceed ANSI/ISEA Z87.1 standards, which indicates the eyewear is rated for ballistic strikes. Mesh eyewear has also seen some limited use by players due to low cost and its inability to fog, although it has drawn some criticism for its non-impact rated construction and vulnerability to debris. Some impacts (particularly at close range with powerful guns) are capable of cracking or damaging teeth. Dentists have reported broken teeth that require root canal and crowns to repair damage. A face mask (like that used for paintball) is recommended to protect eyes and teeth. Metallic mesh masks and mouth guards have recently{{when|date=August 2019}} seen popular use.\n\nThere are [[legal issues in airsoft]] as well as several rules imposed in a game by game basis. Most indoor airsoft fields only allow up to {{convert|350|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}, and most outdoor fields begin capping near the 410&nbsp;ft/s (125&nbsp;m/s) for rifles and 525&nbsp;ft/s (160&nbsp;m/s) for long-range guns such as sniper rifles. Most outdoor fields also impose a minimum engagement distance for guns firing over a certain range, normally for squad support weapons and sniper rifles. In order for an airsoft gun to cause any serious injury, it would have to be well over these limits and in close proximity. To even reach such speeds, the gun would have to be highly modified. So it is therefore unlikely to cause permanent or serious damage with any stock airsoft gun. The use of metallic BBs, or any foreign objects, is very dangerous for the user and other people and property in close vicinity, and may damage the airsoft gun as well. However, specially designed and built metallic 6&nbsp;mm BBs for airsoft guns can be found on the market. These metallic BBs should not be used for airsoft play because they can break through goggles and other safety gear.\n\nAlthough airsoft guns in the United States are generally sold with a 6&nbsp;mm (0.24in.) or longer orange tip on the barrel in order to distinguish them from real firearms, this is not in fact required by federal law. There is some controversy on this topic as [[Title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations]], on foreign commerce and trade, stipulates that \"no person shall manufacture, enter into commerce, ship, transport, or receive any toy, look-alike, or imitation firearm\" without approved markings; these may include an orange tip, orange barrel plug, brightly colored exterior of the whole toy, or transparent construction (part 272.2, formerly part 1150.2). However, section 272.1 (formerly 1150.1) clearly indicates that these restrictions shall not apply to \"traditional b-b, paint-ball, or pellet-firing air guns that expel a projectile through the force of compressed air, compressed gas or mechanical spring action, or any combination thereof.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Title 15 Part 272 Marking of toy, look-alike and imitation firearms|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&SID=c7b9dfa1176c8b46b470823f9207f044&ty=HTML&h=L&n=15y1.2.2.8.9&r=PART|work=Electronic Code of Federal Regulations|publisher=US Government Printing Office|accessdate=November 24, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106024749/http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&SID=c7b9dfa1176c8b46b470823f9207f044&ty=HTML&h=L&n=15y1.2.2.8.9&r=PART|archivedate=January 6, 2015}}</ref> Local laws may differ by jurisdiction. Full or partial preventive painting of airsoft guns as a legal obligation to avoid confusion of the airsoft replicas with real lethal weapons is in practice in several jurisdictions around the world.\n\nA common controversy referred to as ''\"Pumping\"''  or ''\"Roping\"'' is the act of purposely cheating and/or firing 20+ airsoft rounds at one player until they run away or submit in pain. Popular videos such as '''''\"Rip Kid\"''<ref>{{Citation||title=Fuck you painter|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR3T1nfi0H8|access-date=2018-12-18}}</ref>''' and '''''\"SC Trip 2015\"'''<ref>{{Citation|last=TeamMIA3D|title=SC Trip 2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QNg3G2ewAA|access-date=2018-12-18}}</ref>'' have both documented the act of ''\"pumping\".'' Many are concerned over the safety of the player(s) on the other end, as well as their probability of returning to the hobby. Several Airsoft Arenas/Fields across the US have implemented strict \"Semi Auto Fire Only\" rules, as well as other rules aimed at deterring players who come out and intend to harm other players.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Airsoft guns.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Tokyo Marui]] [[M14 rifle|M14]], Marui [[MP5]]A4, G&P [[M4 Carbine|M4]]-[[CQBR]], Jing Gong [[Colt Commando|XM177E2]], Galaxy [[MP5K-PDW]], Maruzen [[M870]] BV, Tokyo Marui [[P226]], KSC [[Beretta 92FS|M92]] FS Elite IA, Kokusai [[Smith & Wesson Model 10|M10]] (2&nbsp;inch), MGC [[M1911]], Kokusai M10 (4&nbsp;inch), Tanaka [[Colt Python]] (4&nbsp;inch).]] -->\n\n=== Police shootings ===\n*On January 13, 2006, [[Christopher Penley]], a 15-year-old student with an airsoft gun painted entirely black, was killed by a SWAT team member at Milwee Middle School in Longwood, Florida.\n*On October 22, 2013, 13-year-old [[Shooting of Andy Lopez|Andy Lopez]] was shot by a Sonoma County sheriff's deputy Erick Gelhaus.

Certain companies such as [[Classic Army]] or ICS avoid this problem by licensing their replicas from the original manufacturers such as [[ArmaLite]] by license from ActionSportGames or [[Olympic Arms]]. The airsoft company ActionSportGames has licensed trademark rights from many well-known firearm manufacturers, such as Armalite, [[Dan Wesson Firearms|Dan Wesson]], [[\u010cesk\u00e1 zbrojovka firearms|CZ]], [[Steyr Mannlicher|Steyr]], [[STI International|STI]], [[Br\u00fcgger & Thomet|B&T]] and [[Franchi (firearms)|Franchi]].\n\nAnother company who licence the designs of gun companies is Evolution International.

Some end users have made attempts to sell their guns, some in the style of [[Glock]] pistols, only to find Glock blocking the sale and threatening legal action. In addition to these actions, Glock, as well as HK, have blocked the sale, trade and distribution of replicas bearing resemblance to their products.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.popularairsoft.com/umarex-wins-hk-trademark-use-lawsuits |title=Umarex Wins On H&K Trademark Use Lawsuits |author=Logan |date=December 6, 2012 |website=www.popularairsoft.com |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010004636/https://www.popularairsoft.com/umarex-wins-hk-trademark-use-lawsuits |archivedate=October 10, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rsairsoft.tumblr.com/post/37171317661/no-more-hk-guns|title=H&K is going the way of Glock!|website=Ranger Studios|language=en|access-date=2017-12-22|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304114923/http://rsairsoft.tumblr.com/post/37171317661/no-more-hk-guns|archivedate=2016-03-04}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Airsoft pellets]]\n* [[Legal issues in airsoft]]\n* [[Air gun]]\n* [[BB gun]]\n* [[Paintball]]\n* [[Gel ball shooter]]\n* [[Entertech]]\n* [[Xploderz]]\n* [[Nerf]], a similar gun that's closely and safely related to Airsoft.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"epa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/ozone/snap/aerosol/aerosol.pdf|title=Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) - US EPA |website=Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=May 9, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616125854/http://www.epa.gov/Ozone/snap/aerosol/aerosol.pdf|archivedate=June 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"epa1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/spdpublc/fedregstr/58fr50464.html|title=58 FR 50464 &#124; Ozone Layer Protection \u2013 Regulatory Programs &#124; US EPA|website=epa.gov|accessdate=May 9, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107152010/http://www.epa.gov/spdpublc/fedregstr/58fr50464.html|archivedate=January 7, 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"gas\">{{cite web |url=https://www.400fps.com/airsoft_blog/gas/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130116034504/https://www.400fps.com/airsoft_blog/gas/ |archivedate=2013-01-16 }} Gas descriptions</ref>\n\n}}\n\n[[Category:Airsoft]]\n[[Category:Pneumatic weapons]]\n[[Category:Airsoft guns]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=August 2019}}\n{{for|the sport|Airsoft}}\n{{More citations needed|date=June 2008}}\n[[File:ca m15a4.jpg|thumb|right|[[Classic Army]] M4 AEG with a replica [[Aimpoint CompM2]] [[red dot sight]]|200px]]\n'''Airsoft guns''' are [[replica]] [[toy gun|toy weapon]]s used in [[airsoft]] sports.  They are a special type of very low-power [[smoothbore]] [[airgun]]s designed to shoot [[airsoft pellets|non-metallic spherical projectiles]] often colloquially (but incorrectly) referred to as \"[[BB (ammunition)|BB]]s\", which are typically made of (but not limited to) [[plastic]] or [[biodegradable polymer|biodegradable]] [[resin]] materials. Airsoft gun powerplants are designed to have low [[muzzle energy]] ratings (generally less than 1.5 [[Joule|J]], or 1.1 [[Foot-pound (energy)|ft\u22c5lb]]) and the pellets have significantly less [[penetration (weaponry)|penetrative]] and [[stopping power]]s than conventional airguns, and are generally safe for [[competitive sport]]ing and [[recreation]]al purposes if proper [[protective gear]] is worn.\n\nDepending on the design mechanism for pellet propulsion, airsoft guns can be categorized into two groups: mechanical, which consists of a [[coil spring]]-loaded [[piston pump|piston]] [[air pump]] that is either manually cocked (e.g. spring guns) or automatically cycled by a [[electric battery|battery]]-powered [[electric motor]] [[gearbox]] (e.g. AEGs); and [[pneumatic]], which operates by valve-controlled release of prefilled [[bottled gas]] such as [[compressed gas|compressed]] [[propane]] mixed with [[silicone oil]] (commonly known as \"Green Gas\") or [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] canisters (e.g. GBB guns).\n\nAs toy weapons, airsoft guns can often be designed to realistically resemble genuine firearms in external appearance, and it can be very difficult to visually distinguish from one despite the orange muzzle tips in some jurisdictions.  However, regardless of the cosmetic resemblance, airsoft guns cannot be functionally modified into real firearms due to its construction and design.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://airsoft-facts.com/airsoft-equipment-1|title=Airsoft Equipment|website=airsoft-facts.com|access-date=2018-04-06|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407182608/http://airsoft-facts.com/airsoft-equipment-1|archivedate=2018-04-07}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Usage ==\n[[File:Systema ptw01.jpg|thumbnail|[[Systema Engineering|Systema]] Professional Training Weapon System M4A1 MAX]]\n[[File:Flickr - The U.S. Army - Airsoft adds hard edge to combat training.jpg|thumb|Soldiers with the [[US Army]] 187th Ordnance Battalion prepared to clear a room during urban combat training at the battalion's Field Training Exercise site.

In 2018, the [[United States Coast Guard]] has officially adopted [[SIG Sauer#SIG Air|SIG]]-branded P229 airsoft pistol for training.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.military.com/kitup/2018/11/05/coast-guard-buys-sig-p229-airsoft-clone-its-new-training-sidearm.html|title=Coast Guard Buys Sig P229 Airsoft Clone as Its New Training Sidearm|author=Matthew Cox|publisher=Military.com|date=2018-11-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2018/11/05/coast-guard-airsoft-gun/|title=US Coast Guard Pick SIG P229 Airsoft Pistol for Training|author=Matthew Moss|publisher=The Firearm Blog|date=2019-02-04}}</ref>  The GBB guns allowed for correct weapon manipulation drills, [[muscle memory]] training, [[Cognitive behavioral therapy#Stress inoculation training|stress inoculation]] and [[opposing force|force-on-force]] simulations for a fraction of the cost of conventional bolt conversion kits that use marking cartridges with [[wax bullet]]s from training ammunition manufacturers such as UTM and Simunition.  Airsoft guns also allow basic and advanced shooter training in a safer environment by reducing the risks of accidental injury or death from a [[negligent discharge]].\n\nThere are clubs, teams and even athletic associations devoted to airsoft events around the world. Europe is home to some of the largest events, with skirmishes of over 2,000 people participating. In North America, in 2012 alone, [[Fulda Gap]] Airsoft Game in [[Taylorsville, North Carolina]] had over 1,100 participants, and Operation Lion Claws Military Simulation Series (OLCMSS) had 800 people attend at [[George Air Force Base]] in [[Victorville, California]]. American Mil-sim, Black Sheep, and Ballahack also host large games. The attraction of the larger games is due to the intensity and variety in equipment that is used, ranging from small arms to armored vehicles.\n\nIn many countries, every airsoft gun owner and active enthusiast must be affiliated with an accredited airsoft association or federation. Most airsoft players host games at a registered field where combat situations are simulated using airsoft weaponry like replica [[pistol]]s, [[submachine guns]], [[carbine]]s/[[assault rifle]]s, [[designated marksman rifle|DMR]]s/[[sniper rifle]]s, [[light machine gun]]s, [[grenade]]s and [[landmine]]s. Great variety and profusion of [[militaria]] is usually used. [[Historical reenactment]] of famous war situations is another favorite of many airsoft players and clubs. In addition, a number of companies such as [[Systema Engineering]] and Celsius Technology manufacture ultra-realistic high-velocity airsoft rifles designed specifically for the police and military for non-lethal training purposes. People today can also use it as [[Theatrical property|props]] for [[film making]].\n\n== Types ==\n\n=== Spring-powered ===\n'''Spring-powered airsoft guns''' (or \"'''air-cocking guns'''\" as called by [[Tokyo Marui]]) are [[single-shot]] devices that use the [[elastic potential energy]] stored within a compressed [[coil spring]] to drive a [[piston pump|piston air pump]], which is released upon trigger-pull and rapidly pressurizes the air within the pump cylinder to in turn \"blow\" pellets down the [[gun barrel]].  These guns are almost identical (though simplified and underpowered) in design to [[air gun#Spring-piston|spring-piston air gun]]s and have the same operation principles. The user must manually recompress the spring under [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] prior to each shot, typically by pulling back the [[pistol slide|slide]] (pistols), [[cocking handle|bolt handle]] (rifles) or [[pump action|forend pump]] (shotguns) on the weapon, which cocks and readies the gun.  Because of this, spring guns are incapable of [[automatic firearm|automatic]] or [[semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] firing by design.\n\nSpring-powered airsoft guns are generally not as powerful as gas-powered ones, but are more powerful than electric airsoft guns because stiffer springs can often be used without the worry of overloading any motor-gearbox, although some spring [[shotgun]]s and [[bolt-action rifle]]s can be very powerful with [[muzzle velocity|muzzle velocities]] up to {{convert|400|\u2013|700|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. Spring guns are generally inexpensive (except the high-power sniper rifles and shotguns), and may not last long (depending on the build quality) due to the tension exerted on the gun parts by the recoiling of a powerful spring. However, many spring guns can be modified and upgraded to last longer and shoot more powerfully.\n\nWhile most electric airsoft guns also use springs to drive the air pump and propel the pellets, they use external power sources and are not considered to be in the same category as the single-shot manual spring guns. Low-end spring guns tend to be much cheaper than their electric equivalents due to their simplicity and lack of electrical components ([[electric motor]]/[[actuator]], spring-[[gearbox]] assembly, as well as battery and battery charger) and thus are widely available. These guns are less suited for competition because they are at a rate-of-fire disadvantage against automatic guns in close combat and do not provide enough accuracy and power for long-range use. There are some exceptions, however, as higher-end spring-powered airsoft rifles can be quite expensive; these guns are typically suited for \"marksman\" applications in airsoft matches and provide competitive muzzle velocities. Additionally, pump shotguns are sometimes used for both short and longer range engagements. In colder weather, spring pistols are more reliable than gas-powered pistols and even the batteries on automatic electric pistols (AEPs) both of which can be adversely affected by extreme low temperatures. This represents one of the major advantages of spring airsoft gun, as it can be fired in practically any situations without relying on [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] or [[bottled gas]]. This independence from external power sources causes some players to favor spring-powered guns. Spring guns are also less susceptible to the effects of water, where a battery-powered gun could [[short-circuit]] and malfunction when wet.\n\nSpring-powered weapons are often cheaper than electric or gas-powered weapons. They are also more readily available in most department stores.  Because of their low price, availability and simplicity, spring guns tend to act as \"training guns\" to bring new players to airsoft games and are considered the primary weapon of \"backyard skirmishes\". In the UK, they are affectionately known as \"springers\" and were often a player's introduction to the sport due to the entry-level cost in comparison to AEG and GBB weapons. Almost all airsoft players at some point owned a spring weapon, whether for its actual use in a competitive event or for the replica value since some airsoft weapons are only available as spring versions. However, some veteran airsoft players still rely on [[sniper rifle]] and [[shotgun]]-type spring guns as a primary weapon due to their reliability, high power, high accuracy and low noise, as well as their ease of repair and modification compared to AEGs and GBB guns.\n\nTo be eligible to purchase an airsoft gun in the United States, a person has to be of at least 18 years of age.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://airsofthow.com/where-is-airsoft-legal/|title=Legal Issues of Airsoft|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Battery-powered {{anchor|Electric guns}}===\n====Automatic electric guns====\n[[File:AEG.gif|thumb|left|An illustration of the working of a Version 2 electric motor gearbox]]\n[[File:Bi-3681.jpg|thumb|left|A Dboys M4A1 AEG]]\n[[File:Customised ARES L85.jpg|Customised ARES L85|thumb|left|An ARES L85 AEG customised with a Daniel Defense [[Rail Integration System|rail interface system]], replica [[Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight|ACOG]] sight, Grip Pod and [[Magpul]] PTS EMAG.]]\nElectrically powered airsoft guns use a spring-loaded piston pump just like spring guns, but instead of manual operation they typically use portable [[rechargeable battery|rechargeable]] [[battery pack]]s to power an internal [[electric motor]], which transmit through a [[gearbox]] to compress the pump spring and propel/load the pellets in a cyclic fashion. [[Selective fire]] options among [[automatic firearm|automatic]], 3-round [[burst fire|burst]] and [[semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] operations are all possible, which gives these guns the popular name \"'''automatic electric guns'''\", or '''AEGs'''.<ref name=\"airsplat\">{{cite web|url=http://www.airsplat.com/airsoft-definition.htm|title=Airsoft Guide and Information - What is Airsoft?|website=www.airsplat.com|accessdate=May 9, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119041212/http://www.airsplat.com/airsoft-definition.htm|archivedate=January 19, 2015}}</ref> These guns often attain muzzle velocities from {{convert|150|to|650|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} and [[rate of fire|rates of fire]] (RoF) between 100 and 1500 rounds per minute. They are the most commonly used and widely available type of airsoft gun.\n\nThe AEGs were developed in [[Japan]] and the Japanese company [[Tokyo Marui]] is credited with creating the original gearbox system. In a Tokyo Marui AEG, the motor drives a [[gear train|train]] of three [[gears]] mounted inside a gearbox, which then loads a pump piston against a spring. Once the spring is released, it pushes the piston plunger forward through the pump cylinder to propel a pellet resting within the [[chamber (firearms)|chamber]] forward through the barrel and out of the [[muzzle (firearms)|muzzle]]. Many manufacturers have now more or less replicated this basic model, adding reinforced parts or minor improvements.\n\nThe electric airsoft guns were powered primarily by [[nickel-metal hydride]] (NiMH) batteries with varying [[voltage]]s and [[milliampere-hour]] ratings. The most common battery is an 8.4&nbsp;V large [[battery pack]], with a capacity between 2200 and 5000 mAh. Also available are \"mini\" and \"stick\" batteries, which generally have 900 ~ 1600&nbsp;mAh capacities. Voltages for NiMH batteries range from 7.2&nbsp;V to 12&nbsp;V. The usual rule of thumb is that the higher the mAh rating, the longer the battery lasts; the higher the voltage, the higher the rate of fire.<ref name=\"BatteryLord\">{{in lang|en}}  {{cite web | title=How to Calculate Airsoft Battery Pack Recharge Time | year=2013 | work=www.batterylord.com | url=http://www.batterylord.com/index.php?route=information/information&information_id=15 | accessdate=2013-04-22 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020092953/http://www.batterylord.com/index.php?route=information%2Finformation&information_id=15 | archivedate=2013-10-20 }}</ref> Recently, however, the more energy-dense [[lithium polymer]] (Li-Po) batteries are becoming more popular in the airsoft world, since they last longer, have higher mAh and voltages, and can be charged more frequently without concerns for [[voltage depression]], while at the same time being small and lightweight. Li-Po batteries are usually rated at 7.4&nbsp;V or 11.1&nbsp;V, and varying between 500&nbsp;mAh and 6500&nbsp;mAh.\n\nExternal modifications, such as metal bodies and reinforced plastics that make AEGs look and feel even more realistic, have become very popular.  AEG manufacturers such as [[Classic Army]] and [[Tokyo Marui]] produce replicas that are visually nearly identical to their real counterparts. [[Tokyo Marui]] uses an [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] plastic, whereas [[Classic Army]] features full metal bodied guns and stronger furnishings. Most AEGs produced as of late are designed to be as visually realistic as possible.\n\nThe three most common AEGs on the field are the [[AR-15 variants|AR-15 series]] (such as [[M16 rifle]], [[M4 carbine]], etc.; sometimes referred to as the [[ArmaLite]] or [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] series), the [[Heckler & Koch|H&K]] [[Heckler & Koch MP5|MP5]] series, and the [[AK47|AK or Kalashnikov]] series. Also increasing popular is the [[Heckler & Koch G36|H&K G36]] and more recently, [[FN Herstal|FN]] [[FN P90|P90]] and [[Heckler & Koch MP7|H&K MP7]].  Subsequently, numerous parts for repairs and modifications are commonly available for these rifles. AEG models range from a simple pistol to a [[rocket propelled grenade]] all the way to a [[minigun]].\n\n====Low powered electric guns====\n[[File:Kwa boys commando.jpg|thumb|right|Dboys selective fire \"Boys\" Colt ninja electric rifle, approx. 3/4 scale, pictured with .12 gram Crosman ammunition and Cybergun]]\nSome airsoft guns are called ''low powered electric guns'' (LPEGs) to distinguish them from the original, more expensive and more powerful AEGs even though their mechanical/electrical design and operation is similar. They are not to be confused with ''[[#Mini electrics|mini electrics]]'' (described below). Originally they were only of novelty value, often regarded below spring-operated guns due to their construction and low velocities. Since there are spring action guns that can notably outperform the true low-end LPEGs and can be found at comparable prices, they are generally considered to be better choices.\n\n====Medium price electric guns====\nSome companies \u2013 like UTG with their popular [[Heckler & Koch MP5|MP5]] and [[AK-47]] models \u2013 have improved their quality to such an extent that some models are now considered simply as mid-ranged AEGs that are more affordable but still reasonably effective. Among airsofters, these are commonly called middle priced electric guns (MPEGs). Sometimes, MPEGs are copies or 'clones' of designs by full-price manufacturers like Tokyo Marui.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}  As of late 2008 a small number of MPEG brands such as Echo-1/Jing Gong, and CYMA are considered by many to approach the quality and match the performance of the originals, at less than half the price. \"Fully compatible\" MPEGs imitate the Marui or Classic Army originals so precisely that standard upgrade parts will work with them, making it possible to hot-rod an MPEG to well beyond stock out-of-the-box AEG performance.\n\n====Electric blowbacks====\nElectric blowbacks, also known as EBBs, are high-end AEGs which generally run from a rechargeable 9.6 volt battery. Most models utilizing this system are rifles. EBBs simulate the blowback action of a real pistol or rifle but generally have less of a kick. Essentially an AEG in design, EBBs are just as powerful. However, a drawback to having the blowback feature is that the battery is quickly depleted, additionally blowbacks can cause extra stress on the gear box which may result in the gearbox's shorter life span. The blowback system can be disabled with some tinkering.\n\nElectric blowback can also refer to a feature in some higher-end guns which offers more realistic operation. Companies such as G&G<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.airsofthow.com/top-10-best-airsoft-guns/|title=Best Airsoft Guns|last=|first=|date=|website=AirsoftHow|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> now offer guns such as the combat machine M4 and the combat machine \"RK47\" which has moving parts linked directly to the main mechanism of the gun, such as the bolt. Echo 1 has recently released a Blowback MP5SD. Also, APS (Accuracy Pneumatics Shooting) makes EBB M4A1, M4 Commando, and the AK47. The M4s also have three others with an RIS unit. These weapons perform identically to similar non-blowback offerings, with the added realism of reciprocating bolts and some recoil. Most models incorporate pneumatic blowback systems but some feature mechanical systems.\n\n====Mini electrics====\nRecently, the company Well, well known for its spring guns, began manufacturing a range of battery-powered guns in miniature size that fire only full automatic. They differ from GPMGs in that they are not replicas of real firearms, being miniaturized version of real firearms, mostly made of black or clear plastic.\n\nThey have a small bb capacity, usually between 50 and 100 rounds, but they have fair range and a functional hop-up. They have become very popular in recent years, and are now being manufactured by Tokyo Marui. These \u201cminis,\u201d as they are referred to, are not a viable option in games against AEGs since their small ammo capacity, short range and poor far range accuracy leave their wielder at a large disadvantage.  Mini electric guns are able to compete with spring pistols at close ranges however, primarily due to their higher rate of fire.\n\n====Automatic electric pistols====\nAutomatic electric pistols, abbreviated AEPs, were first introduced by [[Tokyo Marui]] in 2005 with their [[Glock 18#Variants|Glock 18C]] (followed later by a [[Beretta 93R]] model). They were the first handguns to incorporate an electrically powered system that is capable of fully automatic operation.\n\nIn cold weather, AEPs are often considered better sidearms than gas powered pistols, because batteries are not as badly affected by frigid weather. Gases like CO<sub>2</sub> and [[green gas]] are stored in liquid form and require heat in order to vaporize. A gas pistol at {{convert|10|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} will usually only get one to two usable shots from a full magazine, and even will be at reduced power because of the lowered pressure of the gas.\n\nBecause the AEP gearbox and battery are smaller, the velocity of AEP BBs (usually between 200 and {{convert|280|ft/s|m/s|1|abbr=on}}) is relatively slow by the standards of airsoft simulations, rendering them useful only for close-range simulation. However, the advanced hop up units on these new guns tend to compensate for the low power and can produce an effective range comparable to those of an AEG. CYMA has made a clone Glock 18C, which is a lower priced alternative.\n\nAn AEP differs from electric blow-backs because the AEP has a fixed slide (in which there is no external movement of the slide during operation), while an EBB simulates the \"blow back\" action in the slide experienced in a real pistol or Gas Blow Back (GBB). An AEP, however, has much more power and accuracy.\n\nOne of the newer AEP-styled guns is the Marui replica of the Heckler & Koch [[MP7]]. It is considerably larger than either of the other guns, and can be upgraded to a much higher power through the use of an external battery, but uses the same system as the AEP, so the classification is ambiguous. It is slightly more powerful than the others and is a suitable choice for [[CQB]] (Close Quarter Battle) games due to its small size and decent barrel- to gun-length ratio.\n\nSome [[semi-automatic pistol]]s can be modified to be automatic pistols. To make them more effective, they use rechargeable batteries supplied with the gun, and can be replaced with a larger battery to make their [[Rate of fire|ROF]] higher.\n\nDue to restrictions on size, either the electric motor or batteries have to occupy space in the hand grip, reducing the available space for a magazine. Because of this, most AEPs do not use a full size magazine found in most gas powered pistols.\n\nIn addition, most AEPs are constructed almost entirely of plastic and have a light, toy-like feeling to them.\n\n=== Gas-powered ===\n* '''Gas blowback'''\n[[File:USP Compact on flecktarn.JPG|200px|thumb|right|A gas blowback [[Heckler & Koch USP#USP Compact|Heckler & Koch USP Compact]] replica, made by KSC.]]\nGas-powered airsoft guns use the [[pneumatic]] [[potential energy]] stored within [[compressed gas]] to drive the shooting mechanism, and thus operate according to an entirely different design principle to spring- or electrically powered airsoft guns.  The most common type seen is the '''gas blowback''' ('''GBB''') guns.  These gas guns use an internal [[gas cylinder|canister]] (usually within the [[magazine (firearms)|magazine]]) that upon trigger-pull releases the prefilled [[bottled gas]] via a series of valves to propel the pellet and generate a [[blowback (firearms)|blowback]], which simulates [[recoil]] and cyclically loads the next shot.  They are capable of both automatic and semi-automatic operation.\n\nThe most common gases<ref name=\"gas\" /> used are \"[[green gas]]\" and [[propane]] which requires an adaptor. [[HFC-134a]] is also commonly used, particularly with pistols which have plastic sliders due to the lower pressure giving a smaller chance of damage to the weaker slide. Less commonly used gases include \"red gas\" (which is actually [[HCFC-22]]), [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] and [[nitrogen]]/high-pressure air. However it is unlawful to use HCFC-22 as a propellant in the US, as it is a Class II [[ozone-depleting substance]] and its use as an aerosol propellant has been banned since January 1994 under section 610(d) of Clean Air Act.<ref name=\"epa\" /> Red gas is usually avoided unless the airsoft gun has undergone modification, as its relatively high critical pressure can cause damage to the airsoft gun, such as breakage of the slide or bolt. CO<sub>2</sub>, nitrogen, and high pressure air are less common because they need to be stored at higher pressures than \"green gas\" or HFC-134a.\n\nThe first ever gas powered airsoft guns were commonly referred to as \"classic\" guns, owing to their age. These guns were most commonly powered by liquid propellants such as [[Dichlorodifluoromethane|R-12]] (which was marketed by the Japanese as FLON-12 or [[DuPont]] tradename Freon 12) [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]] feeding system with a majority of the configurations containing two tanks, one containing the R-12 and one used as an expansion tank, and the gun itself.  R-12 was a commonly used refrigerant for car air conditioning and refrigerators, and is considered a highly potent ozone-depleting substance and listed as a Class I Ozone Depleting Substance by the US EPA.  Its use as a general purpose aerosol propellant has been banned by the US EPA since March 1978 under 43 FR 11301 for use in aerosol use with a very few exceptions.<ref name=\"epa1\" />  Its use is also banned in many countries under United Nations treaties.  On December 31, 2008, the use of CFCs for medical inhalers were banned.\n\nLater users modified these old guns to be powered by regulated CO<sub>2</sub> canisters or nitrogen/high pressure air bottles to increase power and consistency. However, these guns have largely been superseded by the newer and more versatile AEGs, or automatic electric guns. One of the reasons for this is because the most commonly available propellant, R-12, is costly. Additionally, at high flow rates, liquid propellants tend to cool down, eventually freezing. As cooldown progresses, the rate of fire gradually decreases until the gun ceases operation. The user would then be forced to wait for the propellant to warm up again. CO<sub>2</sub> is not affected as badly by this tendency, and nitrogen/high pressure air is immune to it. Furthermore, if liquid propellant is introduced into the gun's mechanism, rubber parts can freeze and eventually damage the gun. However, it is unlikely for this to occur since once the gas is released from the containing cylinder it instantly turns back into its gaseous state, and expands rapidly. It is doubtful whether the retained pressure behind the BB before it begins to accelerate down the barrel is enough to keep the gas in a liquid form. Also, any gun that is expected to be exposed to the intense cold of de-pressurizing gas should have materials that can handle it.\n\nGas power tends to be used in airsoft pistols where size constraints make electric-powered mechanisms impractical. Other instances where gas is favored are where adjustable velocities are required or where a blowback feature is desired. A blowback feature is a mechanism which cycles a slide or bolt to better simulate a real firearm's operation. Because of the mechanical complexities involved with distributing and regulating gas, these guns have largely given way to electric guns for less specialized applications, however, they still remain favorable amongst most airsofters. They are not just limited to pistols; submachine guns, sniper rifles and assault rifles commonly use gas mechanisms. Whilst the submachine gun replicas typically feature a blowback mechanism similar to the pistol replicas, sniper rifle replicas usually omit the blowback mechanism in favor of reduced [[recoil]] and increased muzzle velocity.\n\nAlong with using gas to power guns, it is also applied for use in replica grenades. These grenades are either projectiles, fired from a grenade launcher such as the [[M203]] or [[GP-30|GP-25]], or throwable. The shells work on the system of an internal piston, filled with gas. Either a series of BB's or in some cases a rubber or soft foam head is seated in or on top of the shell. When the pressure is released the projectile(s) are shot from the launcher sent downrange.\n\nIn the case of the throwable grenades, inside the grenade there is a similar piston to the one used in the shells, but is on a literal \"timer\" that allows the user to clear the area of effect. BB's or powder act as the projectile in the case of these grenades. Currently both types of grenades are not very common, mostly because grenade launchers are quite expensive and the throwable grenades are not very reliable.\n\n* '''High pressure air systems'''\n'''High pressure air''' ('''HPA''') systems are a type of pneumatic airsoft weapon that use externally supplied high pressure air instead of internal gas canisters like the majority of gas-operated airsoft guns.  They work by using a separate high-pressure [[Pressure vessel|air tank]] that is connected to the airsoft gun with a hose, which is connected with a [[pneumatic motor]] inside the gun (called an \"engine\") at where the gearbox would be in a normal electric airsoft gun.  The engine is powered by a fire control unit that can adjust to the desired rates of fire as well as the [[Timing light|dwell]] that determines how much air is released with each individual shot.  There are several types of HPA systems and they vary in both price and performance. Popular HPA brands and engines include PolarStar (Fusion Engine, F1, Jack), Wolverine (Hydra, Bolt, Inferno, Wraith, SMP), Valken (V12), and Tippmann (M4 Carbine)\n\nIt is not definitive which style is more effective. It is more up to personal preference.\n\n=== Hybrid guns ===\nHybrid airsoft guns are the newest type of airsoft guns on the market.  They are basically standard AEGs or GBB guns with a \"little extra reality\" built in, and are usually more powerful.\n* '''AEG hybrid operation''': The magazine is loaded with shell cases, each containing a single plastic pellet.  These shell casings can have a small red cap, the same as those found in any child's toy [[cap gun]] placed on the top of them.  These hybrid guns feature an electrically powered, full blowback system and operate on a \"round-per-shell\" basis such that for every pellet fired, a shell casing is ejected and the cap is fired providing a realistic sound and smoke effect.  Since its debut, the only hybrid guns seen on the market are TOP M4A1, as well as [[M1 Garand]], [[Kar98]], and other rifle models.  These guns are the least common type of gun on the market today and are generally used by collectors and re-enactors rather than skirmishers.\n*  '''Gas blowback hybrid operation''': Hybrid gas blowback airsoft guns are quite similar with hybrid AEGs and their operations are similar with ordinary gas blowback airsoft guns.  A single 6&nbsp;mm pellet is still loaded to a shell casing.  Then it is placed into a magazine.  The airsoft replica itself also has a tank for compressed gas as propellant (such as [[green gas]]).  So as the [[slide (firearms)|slide]]/[[bolt (firearms)|bolt]] is pulled back, it loads a shell into the chamber.  As the trigger is pulled, it releases a small burst of propellant and the pellet is forced out the barrel.\n\n=== Training weapons ===\n[[File:CELCIUS CTW (M4A1 replica).JPG|thumb|right|An airsoft gun made by {{notatypo|Celcius}} Technology (Hong Kong).  This training weapon model is a replica of the [[M4A1]] and also has a G&G [[Trijicon]] [[Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight|ACOG]] scope replica.]]\nAirsoft gun manufacturer [[Systema Engineering]] (PTW) developed a line of airsoft guns and accessories intended for military and law enforcement training. These airsoft guns are made of aircraft-grade [[aluminum]] combined with [[stainless steel]] parts that gives strength, stability, weather protection, and easy maintenance.  These training weapons offer a more realistic display of military weapons. Unfortunately they have been plagued by reliability problems and parts availability.  They have also had models banned from the US for being capable of being converted into real firearms.  Two manufactures, King Arms and KWA, came out with [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]]-approved gas blowback [[AR-15]] replicas that allowed for correct weapons tear down, manipulation and function that were designed for military use, but were also legal for US citizens to own. The King Arms model required upgrade parts out of the parts to give it reliability, though the KWA was plagued by a weak [[hop-up (airsoft)|hop-up]] system, but otherwise reliable.\n\nIn November 5, 2018, the [[United States Coast Guard]], which has long used the [[.40 S&W|.40 caliber]] [[SIG P229]] as its duty sidearm, announced that it will acquire the SIG ProForce P229 CO<sub>2</sub> airsoft pistol (which was then produced under [[brand licensing]] by French [[airsoft]] manufacturer CyberGun, before SIG later ceased external licensing and took over the production in early 2019) as its new training pistol to give cadets and guardsmen the ability to practice gun handling, conduct target practice in various environments, and train in realistic force-on-force scenarios.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.military.com/kitup/2018/11/05/coast-guard-buys-sig-p229-airsoft-clone-its-new-training-sidearm.html|title=Coast Guard Buys Sig P229 Airsoft Clone as Its New Training Sidearm|author=Matthew Cox|publisher=Military.com|date=2018-11-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2018/11/05/coast-guard-airsoft-gun/|title=US Coast Guard Pick SIG P229 Airsoft Pistol for Training|author=Matthew Moss|publisher=The Firearm Blog|date=2019-02-04}}</ref>\n\n== Performance ==\nAirsoft guns shoot [[Airsoft pellets|plastic pellets]] at velocities from {{convert|30|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}} for a low-end spring pistol, to {{convert|200|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}} for heavily upgraded customized sniper rifles. Most non-upgraded AEGs are in the middle, producing velocities from {{convert|90|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}} to {{convert|120|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}}. The internal components of most guns can be upgraded which can increase the pellet velocity significantly. Using heavier pellets (.25&nbsp;g, .3&nbsp;g, etc.) will significantly reduce the gun's muzzle velocity, but can increase accuracy at range and reduce susceptibility to wind drift. Lighter pellets have less kinetic energy than their heavier pellets, despite their higher exit velocity. Decreasing the pellet's weight does not generally increase its range.\n\nA common upgrade done by players is in the \"[[hop-up (airsoft)|hop-up]]\" system, featured in most mid- to high-end AEG's, as well as gas guns and spring sniper rifles.  In this system, the wall of a rubber tube, called a bucking, is forced into the upper path of the pellet right before it begins flying down the inner barrel.  This contact imparts [[backspin]], which in turn gives the pellet a [[Magnus effect|Magnus]] [[lift (force)|lift]] to maintain a flatter trajectory for a longer period of time.  This is adjusted by screws or gears that cause the bucking to only show a small or large presence in the barrel.  Different degrees of firmness of the rubber are considered when a hop-up is being upgraded.\n\n== Safety concerns ==\n{{See also|Legal issues in airsoft}}\nAirsoft is safe when played with proper protective gear.  Most airsoft guns on the market are usually below {{convert|350|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}, but projectiles expelled from any type of airsoft gun can travel as slow as {{convert|65|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} to more than {{convert|700|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} and are capable of breaking skin at {{convert|350-400|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. For example, skirmish play in the United Kingdom has a maximum of 350&nbsp;ft/s, with some airsoft locations having a limit as low as 290&nbsp;ft/s.<ref>{{cite web|title=United Kingdom Airsoft Rules and Laws |url=http://spraythemag.co.uk/2015/11/03/united-kingdom-airsoft-rules-and-laws/ |accessdate=December 17, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419030027/http://spraythemag.co.uk/2015/11/03/united-kingdom-airsoft-rules-and-laws/ |archivedate=April 19, 2016 }}</ref> If under {{convert|300|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}, the hit would have to be within a short range. Blood can be drawn, but injuries that do occur are predominantly superficial. Full-seal protective eyewear (goggles or glasses) is widely considered the minimum protection for airsoft players, as the eyes may be injured by any type of impact. The least amount of protection a player should seek will meet or exceed ANSI/ISEA Z87.1 standards, which indicates the eyewear is rated for ballistic strikes. Mesh eyewear has also seen some limited use by players due to low cost and its inability to fog, although it has drawn some criticism for its non-impact rated construction and vulnerability to debris. Some impacts (particularly at close range with powerful guns) are capable of cracking or damaging teeth. Dentists have reported broken teeth that require root canal and crowns to repair damage. A face mask (like that used for paintball) is recommended to protect eyes and teeth. Metallic mesh masks and mouth guards have recently{{when|date=August 2019}} seen popular use.\n\nThere are [[legal issues in airsoft]] as well as several rules imposed in a game by game basis. Most indoor airsoft fields only allow up to {{convert|350|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}, and most outdoor fields begin capping near the 410&nbsp;ft/s (125&nbsp;m/s) for rifles and 525&nbsp;ft/s (160&nbsp;m/s) for long-range guns such as sniper rifles. Most outdoor fields also impose a minimum engagement distance for guns firing over a certain range, normally for squad support weapons and sniper rifles. In order for an airsoft gun to cause any serious injury, it would have to be well over these limits and in close proximity. To even reach such speeds, the gun would have to be highly modified. So it is therefore unlikely to cause permanent or serious damage with any stock airsoft gun. The use of metallic BBs, or any foreign objects, is very dangerous for the user and other people and property in close vicinity, and may damage the airsoft gun as well. However, specially designed and built metallic 6&nbsp;mm BBs for airsoft guns can be found on the market. These metallic BBs should not be used for airsoft play because they can break through goggles and other safety gear.\n\nAlthough airsoft guns in the United States are generally sold with a 6&nbsp;mm (0.24in.) or longer orange tip on the barrel in order to distinguish them from real firearms, this is not in fact required by federal law. There is some controversy on this topic as [[Title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations]], on foreign commerce and trade, stipulates that \"no person shall manufacture, enter into commerce, ship, transport, or receive any toy, look-alike, or imitation firearm\" without approved markings; these may include an orange tip, orange barrel plug, brightly colored exterior of the whole toy, or transparent construction (part 272.2, formerly part 1150.2). However, section 272.1 (formerly 1150.1) clearly indicates that these restrictions shall not apply to \"traditional b-b, paint-ball, or pellet-firing air guns that expel a projectile through the force of compressed air, compressed gas or mechanical spring action, or any combination thereof.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Title 15 Part 272 Marking of toy, look-alike and imitation firearms|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&SID=c7b9dfa1176c8b46b470823f9207f044&ty=HTML&h=L&n=15y1.2.2.8.9&r=PART|work=Electronic Code of Federal Regulations|publisher=US Government Printing Office|accessdate=November 24, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106024749/http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&SID=c7b9dfa1176c8b46b470823f9207f044&ty=HTML&h=L&n=15y1.2.2.8.9&r=PART|archivedate=January 6, 2015}}</ref> Local laws may differ by jurisdiction. Full or partial preventive painting of airsoft guns as a legal obligation to avoid confusion of the airsoft replicas with real lethal weapons is in practice in several jurisdictions around the world.\n\nA common controversy referred to as ''\"Pumping\"''  or ''\"Roping\"'' is the act of purposely cheating and/or firing 20+ airsoft rounds at one player until they run away or submit in pain. Popular videos such as '''''\"Rip Kid\"''<ref>{{Citation||title=Fuck you painter|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR3T1nfi0H8|access-date=2018-12-18}}</ref>''' and '''''\"SC Trip 2015\"'''<ref>{{Citation|last=TeamMIA3D|title=SC Trip 2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QNg3G2ewAA|access-date=2018-12-18}}</ref>'' have both documented the act of ''\"pumping\".'' Many are concerned over the safety of the player(s) on the other end, as well as their probability of returning to the hobby. Several Airsoft Arenas/Fields across the US have implemented strict \"Semi Auto Fire Only\" rules, as well as other rules aimed at deterring players who come out and intend to harm other players.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Airsoft guns.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Tokyo Marui]] [[M14 rifle|M14]], Marui [[MP5]]A4, G&P [[M4 Carbine|M4]]-[[CQBR]], Jing Gong [[Colt Commando|XM177E2]], Galaxy [[MP5K-PDW]], Maruzen [[M870]] BV, Tokyo Marui [[P226]], KSC [[Beretta 92FS|M92]] FS Elite IA, Kokusai [[Smith & Wesson Model 10|M10]] (2&nbsp;inch), MGC [[M1911]], Kokusai M10 (4&nbsp;inch), Tanaka [[Colt Python]] (4&nbsp;inch).]] -->\n\n=== Police shootings ===\n*On January 13, 2006, [[Christopher Penley]], a 15-year-old student with an airsoft gun painted entirely black, was killed by a SWAT team member at Milwee Middle School in Longwood, Florida.\n*On October 22, 2013, 13-year-old [[Shooting of Andy Lopez|Andy Lopez]] was shot by a Sonoma County sheriff's deputy Erick Gelhaus.

The airsoft company ActionSportGames has licensed trademark rights from many well-known firearm manufacturers, such as Armalite, [[Dan Wesson Firearms|Dan Wesson]], [[\u010cesk\u00e1 zbrojovka firearms|CZ]], [[Steyr Mannlicher|Steyr]], [[STI International|STI]], [[Br\u00fcgger & Thomet|B&T]] and [[Franchi (firearms)|Franchi]].\n\nAnother company who licence the designs of gun companies is Evolution International.

it defeated the incumbent Congress party in the [[1977 Indian general election|1977 general election]]. After three years in power, the Janata party dissolved in 1980 with the members of the erstwhile Jana Sangh reconvening to form the BJP. Although initially unsuccessful, winning only two seats in the [[1984 Indian general election|1984 general election]], it grew in strength on the back of the [[Ram Janmabhoomi|Ram Janmabhoomi movement]]. Following victories in several state elections and better performances in national elections, the BJP became the largest party in the parliament in 1996; however, it lacked a majority in the lower house of Parliament, and its government lasted only 13 days.\n\nAfter the [[1998 Indian general election|1998 general election]], the BJP-led coalition known as the [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA) under Prime Minister [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] formed a government that lasted for a year. Following fresh elections, the NDA government, again headed by Vajpayee, lasted for a full term in office; this was the first non-Congress government to do so. In the [[2004 Indian general election|2004 general election]], the NDA suffered an unexpected defeat, and for the next ten years the BJP was the principal opposition party. Long time [[Gujarat]] Chief Minister [[Narendra Modi]] led it to a landslide victory in the [[2014 Indian general election|2014 general election]]. Since that election, Modi has led the NDA government as Prime Minister and {{As of|2019|2|lc=y}}, the alliance governs 18 states.\n\nThe official ideology of the BJP is [[Integral humanism (India)|integral humanism]], first formulated by [[Deendayal Upadhyaya]] in 1965. The party expresses a commitment to [[Hindutva]], and its policy has historically reflected [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalist]] positions. The BJP advocates [[social conservatism]] and a foreign policy centred on nationalist principles. Its key issues have included the abrogation of the [[Article 370|special status to Jammu and Kashmir]], the building of a [[Ram Lalla Temple|Ram Temple]] in [[Ayodhya]] and the implementation of a [[Uniform civil code of India|uniform civil code]]. However, the 1998\u20132004 NDA government did not pursue any of these controversial issues. It instead focused on a largely [[economic liberalism|liberal]] economic policy prioritising [[globalisation]] and [[economic growth]] over social [[welfare]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Predecessors ===\n==== Bharatiya Jana Sangh (1951\u201377) ====\n{{main|Bharatiya Jana Sangh}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| header    = Influential figures\n| width     = 150\n| image1    = Syama Prasad Mookerjee.jpg\n| caption1  = [[Syama Prasad Mookerjee]], founder of the [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]]\n}}\nThe BJP's origins lie in the [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]], popularly known as the Jana Sangh, founded by [[Syama Prasad Mukherjee]] in 1951 in response to the politics of the dominant [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]]. It was founded in collaboration with the [[Hindu nationalist]] volunteer organisation, the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS), and was widely regarded as the political arm of the RSS.{{sfn|Noorani|1978|p=216}} The Jana Sangh's aims included the protection of India's \"Hindu\" cultural identity, in addition to countering what it perceived to be the appeasement of Muslim people and the country of [[Pakistan]] by the [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]] and then-Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]. The RSS loaned several of its leading ''[[pracharak]]s'', or full-time workers, to the Jana Sangh to get the new party off the ground. Prominent among these was [[Deendayal Upadhyaya]], who was appointed General Secretary. The Jana Sangh won only three [[Lok Sabha]] seats in the [[1952 Indian general election|first general elections in 1952]]. It maintained a minor presence in parliament until 1967.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|1996|pp=116\u2013119}}{{sfn|Guha|2007|p=136}}\n\nThe Jana Sangh's first major campaign, begun in early 1953, centred on a demand for the complete integration of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] into India.{{sfn|Guha|2007|p=250}} Mookerjee was arrested in May 1953 for violating orders from the state government restraining him from entering Kashmir. He died of a heart attack the following month, while still in jail.{{sfn|Guha|2007|p=250}} [[Mauli Chandra Sharma]] was elected to succeed Mookerjee; however, he was forced out of power by the RSS activists within the party, and the leadership went instead to Upadhyaya. Upadhyay remained the General Secretary until 1967, and worked to build a committed grassroots organisation in the image of the RSS. The party minimised engagement with the public, focusing instead on building its network of propagandists. Upadhyaya also articulated the philosophy of [[Integral humanism (India)|integral humanism]], which formed the official doctrine of the party.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|1996|pp=122\u2013126, 129\u2013130}} Younger leaders, such as [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] and [[L. K. Advani|Lal Krishna Advani]] also became involved with the leadership in this period, with Vajpayee succeeding Upadhyaya as president in 1968. The major themes on the party's agenda during this period were legislating a [[Uniform civil code of India|uniform civil code]], banning [[cow slaughter]] and abolishing the [[Article 370 of the Constitution of India|special status given to Jammu and Kashmir]].{{sfn|Guha|2007|pp=250, 352, 413}}\n\nAfter assembly elections across the country in 1967, the party entered into a coalition with several other parties, including the [[Swatantra Party]] and the socialists. It formed governments in various states across the [[Hindi heartland]], including [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Bihar]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]]. It was the first time the Jana Sangh held political office, albeit within a coalition; this caused the shelving of the Jana Sangh's more radical agenda.{{sfn|Guha|2007|pp=427\u2013428}}\n\n==== Janata Party (1977\u201380) ====\n{{Main|Janata Party}}\nIn 1975, Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] imposed a [[The Emergency (India)|state of emergency]]. The Jana Sangh took part in the widespread protests, with thousands of its members being imprisoned along with other agitators across the country. In 1977, the emergency was withdrawn and general elections were held. The Jana Sangh merged with parties from across the political spectrum, including the [[Socialist Party (India)|Socialist Party]], the [[Congress (O)]] and the [[Bharatiya Lok Dal]] to form the Janata Party, with its main agenda being defeating Indira Gandhi.{{sfn|Guha|2007|p=136}}\n\nThe Janata Party won a majority in 1977 and formed a government with [[Morarji Desai]] as Prime Minister. The former Jana Sangh contributed the largest tally to the Janata Party's parliamentary contingent, with 93 seats or 31% of its strength. [[Atal Behari Vajpayee|Vajpayee]], previously the leader of the Jana Sangh, was appointed the [[Minister of External Affairs (India)|Minister of External Affairs]].{{sfn|Guha|2007|pp=538\u2013540}}\n\nThe national leadership of the former Jana Sangh consciously renounced its identity, and attempted to integrate with the political culture of the Janata Party, based on Gandhian and Hindu traditionalist principles. According to [[Christophe Jaffrelot]], this proved to be an impossible assimilation.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|1996|pp=282\u2013283}} The state and local levels of the Jana Sangh remained relatively unchanged, retaining a strong association with the RSS, which did not sit well with the moderate centre-right constituents of the Party.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|1996|pp=292\u2013301, 312}} [[communal violence in India|Violence between Hindus and Muslims]] increased sharply during the years that the Janata Party formed the government, with former Jana Sangha members being implicated in the riots at [[Aligarh]] and [[Jamshedpur]] in 1978\u201379. The other major constituents of the Janata Party demanded that the Jana Sangh should break from the RSS, which the Jana Sangh refused to do. Eventually, a fragment of the Janata Party broke off to form the [[Janata Party (Secular)]]. The [[Morarji Desai]] government was reduced to a minority in the Parliament, forcing its resignation. Following a brief period of coalition rule, general elections were held in 1980, in which the Janata Party fared poorly, winning only 31 seats. In April 1980, shortly after the elections, the National Executive Council of the Janata Party banned its members from being 'dual members' of party and the RSS. In response, the former Jana Sangh members left  to create a new political party, known as the Bharatiya Janata Party.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|1996|pp=301\u2013312}}{{sfn|Guha|2007|pp=538\u2013540}}\n\n=== BJP (1980\u2013present) ===\n\n{{Photomontage\n|photo1a= Ab vajpayee.jpg\n|photo1b= Lkadvani.jpg\n| position = center\n| size = 300\n| color = #F5F5F5\n| border = 1\n| color_border = black\n| spacing = 3\n| foot_montage =  \n |text= {{center|[[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]], the first [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] from BJP (Right), [[L.

Historian [[Ramachandra Guha]] writes that the early 1980s were marked by a wave of violence between Hindus and Muslims. The BJP initially moderated the [[Hindu nationalist]] stance of its predecessor the Jana Sangh to gain a wider appeal, emphasising its links to the Janata Party and the ideology of [[Gandhian Socialism]].{{sfn|Malik|Singh|1992|pp=318\u2013336}} This was unsuccessful, as it won only two [[Lok Sabha]] seats in the [[1984 Indian general election|elections of 1984]].{{sfn|Malik|Singh|1992|pp=318\u2013336}} The [[assassination of Indira Gandhi]] a few months earlier resulted in a wave of support for the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] which won a record tally of 403 seats, contributing to the low number for the BJP.{{sfn|Guha|2007|p=579}}\n\n==== Ram Janmabhoomi movement and the Hindutva policies ====\n{{main|Ram Rath Yatra}} \n{{Further|Ayodhya dispute|Demolition of the Babri Masjid}}\n[[File:Advani Yatra 1990.svg|thumb|[[Ram Rath Yatra]]]] \nThe failure of Vajpayee's moderate strategy led to a shift in the ideology of the party toward a policy of more hardline Hindu nationalism.{{sfn|Malik|Singh|1992|pp=318\u2013336}}{{sfn|Pai|1996|pp=1170\u20131183}} In 1984, Advani was appointed president of the party, and under him it became the political voice of the [[Ram Janmabhoomi|Ram Janmabhoomi movement]]. In the early 1980s, the [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]] (VHP) began a campaign for the construction of a [[Ram Lalla Temple|temple]] dedicated to the Hindu deity [[Rama]] at the [[Ayodhya dispute|disputed site]] of the [[Babri Masjid|Babri Mosque]] in [[Ayodhya]]. The mosque had been constructed by the Mughal Emperor [[Babur]] in 1527. There is a dispute about whether a temple once stood there.{{sfn|Jha|2003}} The agitation was on the basis of the belief that the site is the birthplace of Rama, and that a temple had been demolished to construct the mosque.{{sfn|Flint|2005|p=165}} The BJP threw its support behind this campaign, and made it a part of their election platform. It won 86 Lok Sabha seats in 1989, a tally which made its support crucial to the [[National Front (India)|National Front]] government of [[V. P. Singh]].{{sfn|Guha|2007|pp=582\u2013598}}\n\nIn September 1990, Advani began a ''[[rath yatra]]'' (chariot journey) to Ayodhya in support of the Ram temple movement. According to Guha, the imagery employed by the ''yatra'' was \"religious, allusive, militant, masculine, and anti-Muslim\", and the speeches delivered by Advani during the ''yatra'' accused the government of appeasing Muslims and practising \"[[pseudo-secularism]]\" that obstructed the legitimate aspirations of Hindus.{{sfn|Guha|2007|pp=635}} Advani defended the yatra, stating that it had been free of incident from [[Somnath]] to [[Ayodhya]], and that the English media were to blame for the violence that followed.{{sfn|Reddy|2008}} Advani was placed under preventive detention on the orders of the then [[Bihar]] chief minister [[Lalu Prasad Yadav]]. A large number of ''[[kar sevak]]s'' nonetheless converged on Ayodhya. On the orders of [[Uttar Pradesh]] chief minister [[Mulayam Singh Yadav]], 150,000 of them were detained, yet half as many managed to reach Ayodhya and some attacked the mosque. Three days of fighting with the paramilitary forces ended with the deaths of several ''kar sevaks''. Hindus were urged by VHP to \"take revenge\" for these deaths, resulting in riots against Muslims across Uttar Pradesh. {{sfn|Guha|2007|pp=636}} The BJP withdrew its support from the V.P. Singh government, leading to fresh general elections. It once again increased its tally, to 120 seats, and won a majority in the [[Uttar Pradesh]] assembly.{{sfn|Guha|2007|pp=633\u2013659}}\n\nOn 6 December 1992, the RSS and its affiliates organised a rally involving more than 100,000 VHP and BJP activists at the site of the mosque.{{sfn|Guha|2007|pp=633\u2013659}} Under circumstances that are not entirely clear, the rally developed into a frenzied attack that ended with the [[Demolition of the Babri Masjid|demolition of the mosque]].{{sfn|Guha|2007|pp=633\u2013659}} Over the following weeks, waves of violence between Hindus and Muslims erupted all over the country, killing over 2,000 people.{{sfn|Guha|2007|pp=633\u2013659}} The government briefly banned the VHP, and many BJP leaders, including  Advani were arrested for making inflammatory speeches provoking the demolition.{{sfn|NDTV|2012}}{{sfn|Al Jazeera|2009}} Several historians have said that the demolition was the product of a conspiracy by the Sangh Parivar, and not a spontaneous act.{{sfn|Guha|2007|pp=633\u2013659}}\n\nA [[Liberhan Commission|2009 report]], authored by Justice [[Manmohan Singh Liberhan]], found that 68 people were responsible for the demolition, mostly leaders from the BJP.{{sfn|Al Jazeera|2009}} Among those named were Vajpayee, Advani, and [[Murli Manohar Joshi]]. The report also criticised [[Kalyan Singh]], Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh during the demolition.{{sfn|Al Jazeera|2009}} He was accused of posting bureaucrats and police officers who would stay silent during the demolition.{{sfn|Al Jazeera|2009}} Anju Gupta, an [[Indian Police Service]] officer in charge of Advani's security, appeared as a prominent witness before the commission. She said that Advani and Joshi made provocative speeches that were a major factor in the mob's behaviour.{{sfn|Venkatesan|2005}}\n\nIn the parliamentary elections in 1996, the BJP capitalised on the communal polarisation that followed the demolition to win 161 Lok Sabha seats, making it the largest party in parliament.{{sfn|Guha|2007|p=633}} Vajpayee was sworn in as Prime Minister, but was unable to attain a majority in the Lok Sabha, forcing the government to resign after 13 days.{{sfn|Guha|2007|p=633}}\n\n==== NDA government (1998\u20132004) ====\n{{further|National Democratic Alliance}}\n\nA coalition of regional parties formed the government in 1996, but this grouping was short lived, and mid-term polls were held in 1998. The BJP contested the elections leading a coalition called the [[National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA), which contained its existing allies like the [[Samata Party]], the [[Shiromani Akali Dal]], the [[Shiv Sena]] in addition to the [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (AIADMK) and the [[Biju Janata Dal]]. Among these regional parties, the Shiv Sena was the only one which had an ideology similar to the BJP; [[Amartya Sen]], for example, called the coalition an \"ad hoc\" grouping.{{sfn|Jones|2013}}{{sfn|Sen|2005|p=254}} The NDA had a majority with outside support from the [[Telugu Desam Party]] (TDP) and Vajpayee returned as Prime Minister.{{sfn|rediff.com|1998}} However, the coalition ruptured in May 1999 when the leader of AIADMK, [[Jayalalitha]], withdrew her support, and fresh elections were held again.{{sfn|Outlook|2013}}\n\nOn 13 October 1999, the NDA, without the AIADMK, won 303 seats in parliament and thus an outright majority. The BJP had its highest ever tally of 183. Vajpayee became Prime Minister for the third time; Advani became Deputy Prime Minister and [[Minister for Home Affairs (India)|Home Minister]]. This NDA government lasted its full term of five years. Its policy agenda included a more aggressive stance on defence and terror as well as [[neo-liberalism|neo-liberal]] economic policies.{{sfn|Sen|2005|pp=251\u2013272}}\n\nIn 2001, [[Bangaru Laxman]], then the BJP president, was filmed accepting a bribe of {{INRConvert|100,000|year=2001}}{{sfn|Outlook|2012}} to recommend the purchase of hand-held thermal imagers for the Indian Army to the Defence Ministry, in [[Operation West End|a sting operation by ''Tehelka'' journalists]].{{sfn|Kattakayam|2012}}{{sfn|India Today|2001}} The BJP was forced to make him resign and he was subsequently prosecuted.

The incident was seen as an attack upon Hindus, and sparked off massive anti-Muslim violence across the state of [[Gujarat]] that lasted several weeks.{{sfn|Ghassem-Fachandi|2012|pp=1\u201331}} The death toll estimated was as high as 2000, while 150,000 were displaced.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2013|p=16}} Rape, mutilation, and torture were also widespread.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2013|p=16}}{{sfn|Harris|2012}} The then-Gujarat chief minister [[Narendra Modi]] and several high-ranking government officials were accused of initiating and condoning the violence, as were police officers who allegedly directed the rioters and gave them lists of Muslim-owned properties.{{sfn|Krishnan|2012}} In April 2009, a Special Investigation Team (SIT) was appointed by the Supreme Court to investigate and expedite the Gujarat riots cases.

The NDA's campaign was based on the slogan \"[[India Shining]]\", which sought to depict it as responsible for a rapid economic transformation of the country.{{sfn|Ramesh|2004}} However, the NDA unexpectedly suffered a heavy defeat, winning only a 186 seats in the Lok Sabha, compared to the 222 of the Congress and its allies. [[Manmohan Singh]] succeeded Vajpayee as Prime Minister as the head of the [[United Progressive Alliance]].

There is a significant range of economic ideologies within the party. In the 1980s, like the Jana Sangh, it reflected the thinking of the RSS and its affiliates. It supported ''[[swadeshi]]'' (the promotion of indigenous industries and products) and a [[protectionist|protectionist export policy]]. However, it supported internal [[economic liberalisation]], and opposed the state-driven industrialisation favoured by the Congress.{{sfn|Shulman|2000|pp=365\u2013390}}\n\nDuring the 1996 elections, the BJP shifted its stance away from protectionism and towards [[globalisation]]; its election manifesto recommended increasing foreign investment in priority sectors, while restricting it in others. When the party was in power in 1998, it shifted its policy even further in favour of globalisation. The tenure of the NDA saw an unprecedented influx of foreign companies in India.{{sfn|Shulman|2000|pp=365\u2013390}} This was criticised by the left parties and the BJP's affiliates (the RSS and the Swadeshi Jagran Manch).{{sfn|Shulman|2000|pp=365\u2013390}} The communist parties said that the BJP was attempting to appease the [[World Bank]] and the United States government through its [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] policies.{{sfn|Shulman|2000|pp=365\u2013390}} Similarly, the RSS stated that the BJP was not being true to its ''swadeshi'' ideology.{{sfn|Shulman|2000|pp=365\u2013390}}\n\nThe two NDA governments in the period 1998\u20132004 introduced significant deregulation and privatisation of government owned enterprises. It also introduced tariff-reducing measures. These reforms built off of the initial economic liberalisation introduced by the Congress government in the early 1990s.{{sfn|Tiwari|2012}} India's GDP growth increased substantially during the tenure of the NDA.

They were seen as an attempt to display India's military prowess to the world, and a reflection of anti-Pakistan sentiment within the BJP.{{sfn|Ganguly|1999|pp=148\u2013177}}\n\nThe Vajpayee government ordered the Indian armed forces to expel the Pakistani soldiers occupying [[Kashmir]] territory, later known as the [[Kargil War]].{{sfn|Qadir|2002|pp=1\u201310}}{{sfn|Abbas|2004|p=173}} Although the government was later criticised for the intelligence failures that did not detect Pakistani presence, it was successful in ousting them from the previously Indian-controlled territory.{{sfn|Qadir|2002|pp=1\u201310}}{{sfn|Abbas|2004|p=173}} The Vajpayee administration also offered political support to the US War on Terror, in the hope of better addressing India's issues with terrorism and insurgency in Kashmir.

it defeated the incumbent Congress party in the [[1977 Indian general election|1977 general election]]. After three years in power, the Janata party dissolved in 1980 with the members of the erstwhile Jana Sangh reconvening to form the BJP. Although initially unsuccessful, winning only two seats in the [[1984 Indian general election|1984 general election]], it grew in strength on the back of the [[Ram Janmabhoomi|Ram Janmabhoomi movement]]. Following victories in several state elections and better performances in national elections, the BJP became the largest party in the parliament in 1996; however, it lacked a majority in the lower house of Parliament, and its government lasted only 13 days.\n\nAfter the [[1998 Indian general election|1998 general election]], the BJP-led coalition known as the [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA) under Prime Minister [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] formed a government that lasted for a year. Following fresh elections, the NDA government, again headed by Vajpayee, lasted for a full term in office; this was the first non-Congress government to do so. In the [[2004 Indian general election|2004 general election]], the NDA suffered an unexpected defeat, and for the next ten years the BJP was the principal opposition party. Long time [[Gujarat]] Chief Minister [[Narendra Modi]] led it to a landslide victory in the [[2014 Indian general election|2014 general election]]. Since that election, Modi has led the NDA government as Prime Minister and {{As of|2019|2|lc=y}}, the alliance governs 18 states.\n\nThe official ideology of the BJP is [[Integral humanism (India)|integral humanism]], first formulated by [[Deendayal Upadhyaya]] in 1965. The party expresses a commitment to [[Hindutva]], and its policy has historically reflected [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalist]] positions. The BJP advocates [[social conservatism]] and a foreign policy centred on nationalist principles. Its key issues have included the abrogation of the [[Article 370|special status to Jammu and Kashmir]], the building of a [[Ram Lalla Temple|Ram Temple]] in [[Ayodhya]] and the implementation of a [[Uniform civil code of India|uniform civil code]]. However, the 1998\u20132004 NDA government did not pursue any of these controversial issues. It instead focused on a largely [[economic liberalism|liberal]] economic policy prioritising [[globalisation]] and [[economic growth]] over social [[welfare]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Predecessors ===\n==== Bharatiya Jana Sangh (1951\u201377) ====\n{{main|Bharatiya Jana Sangh}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| header    = Influential figures\n| width     = 150\n| image1    = Syama Prasad Mookerjee.jpg\n| caption1  = [[Syama Prasad Mookerjee]], founder of the [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]]\n}}\nThe BJP's origins lie in the [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]], popularly known as the Jana Sangh, founded by [[Syama Prasad Mukherjee]] in 1951 in response to the politics of the dominant [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]]. It was founded in collaboration with the [[Hindu nationalist]] volunteer organisation, the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS), and was widely regarded as the political arm of the RSS.{{sfn|Noorani|1978|p=216}} The Jana Sangh's aims included the protection of India's \"Hindu\" cultural identity, in addition to countering what it perceived to be the appeasement of Muslim people and the country of [[Pakistan]] by the [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]] and then-Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]. The RSS loaned several of its leading ''[[pracharak]]s'', or full-time workers, to the Jana Sangh to get the new party off the ground. Prominent among these was [[Deendayal Upadhyaya]], who was appointed General Secretary. The Jana Sangh won only three [[Lok Sabha]] seats in the [[1952 Indian general election|first general elections in 1952]]. It maintained a minor presence in parliament until 1967.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|1996|pp=116\u2013119}}{{sfn|Guha|2007|p=136}}\n\nThe Jana Sangh's first major campaign, begun in early 1953, centred on a demand for the complete integration of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] into India.{{sfn|Guha|2007|p=250}} Mookerjee was arrested in May 1953 for violating orders from the state government restraining him from entering Kashmir. He died of a heart attack the following month, while still in jail.{{sfn|Guha|2007|p=250}} [[Mauli Chandra Sharma]] was elected to succeed Mookerjee; however, he was forced out of power by the RSS activists within the party, and the leadership went instead to Upadhyaya. Upadhyay remained the General Secretary until 1967, and worked to build a committed grassroots organisation in the image of the RSS. The party minimised engagement with the public, focusing instead on building its network of propagandists. Upadhyaya also articulated the philosophy of [[Integral humanism (India)|integral humanism]], which formed the official doctrine of the party.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|1996|pp=122\u2013126, 129\u2013130}} Younger leaders, such as [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] and [[L. K. Advani|Lal Krishna Advani]] also became involved with the leadership in this period, with Vajpayee succeeding Upadhyaya as president in 1968. The major themes on the party's agenda during this period were legislating a [[Uniform civil code of India|uniform civil code]], banning [[cow slaughter]] and abolishing the [[Article 370 of the Constitution of India|special status given to Jammu and Kashmir]].{{sfn|Guha|2007|pp=250, 352, 413}}\n\nAfter assembly elections across the country in 1967, the party entered into a coalition with several other parties, including the [[Swatantra Party]] and the socialists. It formed governments in various states across the [[Hindi heartland]], including [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Bihar]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]]. It was the first time the Jana Sangh held political office, albeit within a coalition; this caused the shelving of the Jana Sangh's more radical agenda.{{sfn|Guha|2007|pp=427\u2013428}}\n\n==== Janata Party (1977\u201380) ====\n{{Main|Janata Party}}\nIn 1975, Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] imposed a [[The Emergency (India)|state of emergency]]. The Jana Sangh took part in the widespread protests, with thousands of its members being imprisoned along with other agitators across the country. In 1977, the emergency was withdrawn and general elections were held. The Jana Sangh merged with parties from across the political spectrum, including the [[Socialist Party (India)|Socialist Party]], the [[Congress (O)]] and the [[Bharatiya Lok Dal]] to form the Janata Party, with its main agenda being defeating Indira Gandhi.{{sfn|Guha|2007|p=136}}\n\nThe Janata Party won a majority in 1977 and formed a government with [[Morarji Desai]] as Prime Minister. The former Jana Sangh contributed the largest tally to the Janata Party's parliamentary contingent, with 93 seats or 31% of its strength. [[Atal Behari Vajpayee|Vajpayee]], previously the leader of the Jana Sangh, was appointed the [[Minister of External Affairs (India)|Minister of External Affairs]].{{sfn|Guha|2007|pp=538\u2013540}}\n\nThe national leadership of the former Jana Sangh consciously renounced its identity, and attempted to integrate with the political culture of the Janata Party, based on Gandhian and Hindu traditionalist principles. According to [[Christophe Jaffrelot]], this proved to be an impossible assimilation.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|1996|pp=282\u2013283}} The state and local levels of the Jana Sangh remained relatively unchanged, retaining a strong association with the RSS, which did not sit well with the moderate centre-right constituents of the Party.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|1996|pp=292\u2013301, 312}} [[communal violence in India|Violence between Hindus and Muslims]] increased sharply during the years that the Janata Party formed the government, with former Jana Sangha members being implicated in the riots at [[Aligarh]] and [[Jamshedpur]] in 1978\u201379. The other major constituents of the Janata Party demanded that the Jana Sangh should break from the RSS, which the Jana Sangh refused to do. Eventually, a fragment of the Janata Party broke off to form the [[Janata Party (Secular)]]. The [[Morarji Desai]] government was reduced to a minority in the Parliament, forcing its resignation. Following a brief period of coalition rule, general elections were held in 1980, in which the Janata Party fared poorly, winning only 31 seats. In April 1980, shortly after the elections, the National Executive Council of the Janata Party banned its members from being 'dual members' of party and the RSS. In response, the former Jana Sangh members left  to create a new political party, known as the Bharatiya Janata Party.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|1996|pp=301\u2013312}}{{sfn|Guha|2007|pp=538\u2013540}}\n\n=== BJP (1980\u2013present) ===\n\n{{Photomontage\n|photo1a= Ab vajpayee.jpg\n|photo1b= Lkadvani.jpg\n| position = center\n| size = 300\n| color = #F5F5F5\n| border = 1\n| color_border = black\n| spacing = 3\n| foot_montage =  \n |text= {{center|[[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]], the first [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] from BJP (Right), [[L.

Historian [[Ramachandra Guha]] writes that the early 1980s were marked by a wave of violence between Hindus and Muslims. The BJP initially moderated the [[Hindu nationalist]] stance of its predecessor the Jana Sangh to gain a wider appeal, emphasising its links to the Janata Party and the ideology of [[Gandhian Socialism]].{{sfn|Malik|Singh|1992|pp=318\u2013336}} This was unsuccessful, as it won only two [[Lok Sabha]] seats in the [[1984 Indian general election|elections of 1984]].{{sfn|Malik|Singh|1992|pp=318\u2013336}} The [[assassination of Indira Gandhi]] a few months earlier resulted in a wave of support for the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] which won a record tally of 403 seats, contributing to the low number for the BJP.{{sfn|Guha|2007|p=579}}\n\n==== Ram Janmabhoomi movement and the Hindutva policies ====\n{{main|Ram Rath Yatra}} \n{{Further|Ayodhya dispute|Demolition of the Babri Masjid}}\n[[File:Advani Yatra 1990.svg|thumb|[[Ram Rath Yatra]]]] \nThe failure of Vajpayee's moderate strategy led to a shift in the ideology of the party toward a policy of more hardline Hindu nationalism.{{sfn|Malik|Singh|1992|pp=318\u2013336}}{{sfn|Pai|1996|pp=1170\u20131183}} In 1984, Advani was appointed president of the party, and under him it became the political voice of the [[Ram Janmabhoomi|Ram Janmabhoomi movement]]. In the early 1980s, the [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]] (VHP) began a campaign for the construction of a [[Ram Lalla Temple|temple]] dedicated to the Hindu deity [[Rama]] at the [[Ayodhya dispute|disputed site]] of the [[Babri Masjid|Babri Mosque]] in [[Ayodhya]]. The mosque had been constructed by the Mughal Emperor [[Babur]] in 1527. There is a dispute about whether a temple once stood there.{{sfn|Jha|2003}} The agitation was on the basis of the belief that the site is the birthplace of Rama, and that a temple had been demolished to construct the mosque.{{sfn|Flint|2005|p=165}} The BJP threw its support behind this campaign, and made it a part of their election platform. It won 86 Lok Sabha seats in 1989, a tally which made its support crucial to the [[National Front (India)|National Front]] government of [[V. P. Singh]].{{sfn|Guha|2007|pp=582\u2013598}}\n\nIn September 1990, Advani began a ''[[rath yatra]]'' (chariot journey) to Ayodhya in support of the Ram temple movement. According to Guha, the imagery employed by the ''yatra'' was \"religious, allusive, militant, masculine, and anti-Muslim\", and the speeches delivered by Advani during the ''yatra'' accused the government of appeasing Muslims and practising \"[[pseudo-secularism]]\" that obstructed the legitimate aspirations of Hindus.{{sfn|Guha|2007|pp=635}} Advani defended the yatra, stating that it had been free of incident from [[Somnath]] to [[Ayodhya]], and that the English media were to blame for the violence that followed.{{sfn|Reddy|2008}} Advani was placed under preventive detention on the orders of the then [[Bihar]] chief minister [[Lalu Prasad Yadav]]. A large number of ''[[kar sevak]]s'' nonetheless converged on Ayodhya. On the orders of [[Uttar Pradesh]] chief minister [[Mulayam Singh Yadav]], 150,000 of them were detained, yet half as many managed to reach Ayodhya and some attacked the mosque. Three days of fighting with the paramilitary forces ended with the deaths of several ''kar sevaks''. Hindus were urged by VHP to \"take revenge\" for these deaths, resulting in riots against Muslims across Uttar Pradesh. {{sfn|Guha|2007|pp=636}} The BJP withdrew its support from the V.P. Singh government, leading to fresh general elections. It once again increased its tally, to 120 seats, and won a majority in the [[Uttar Pradesh]] assembly.{{sfn|Guha|2007|pp=633\u2013659}}\n\nOn 6 December 1992, the RSS and its affiliates organised a rally involving more than 100,000 VHP and BJP activists at the site of the mosque.{{sfn|Guha|2007|pp=633\u2013659}} Under circumstances that are not entirely clear, the rally developed into a frenzied attack that ended with the [[Demolition of the Babri Masjid|demolition of the mosque]].{{sfn|Guha|2007|pp=633\u2013659}} Over the following weeks, waves of violence between Hindus and Muslims erupted all over the country, killing over 2,000 people.{{sfn|Guha|2007|pp=633\u2013659}} The government briefly banned the VHP, and many BJP leaders, including  Advani were arrested for making inflammatory speeches provoking the demolition.{{sfn|NDTV|2012}}{{sfn|Al Jazeera|2009}} Several historians have said that the demolition was the product of a conspiracy by the Sangh Parivar, and not a spontaneous act.{{sfn|Guha|2007|pp=633\u2013659}}\n\nA [[Liberhan Commission|2009 report]], authored by Justice [[Manmohan Singh Liberhan]], found that 68 people were responsible for the demolition, mostly leaders from the BJP.{{sfn|Al Jazeera|2009}} Among those named were Vajpayee, Advani, and [[Murli Manohar Joshi]]. The report also criticised [[Kalyan Singh]], Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh during the demolition.{{sfn|Al Jazeera|2009}} He was accused of posting bureaucrats and police officers who would stay silent during the demolition.{{sfn|Al Jazeera|2009}} Anju Gupta, an [[Indian Police Service]] officer in charge of Advani's security, appeared as a prominent witness before the commission. She said that Advani and Joshi made provocative speeches that were a major factor in the mob's behaviour.{{sfn|Venkatesan|2005}}\n\nIn the parliamentary elections in 1996, the BJP capitalised on the communal polarisation that followed the demolition to win 161 Lok Sabha seats, making it the largest party in parliament.{{sfn|Guha|2007|p=633}} Vajpayee was sworn in as Prime Minister, but was unable to attain a majority in the Lok Sabha, forcing the government to resign after 13 days.{{sfn|Guha|2007|p=633}}\n\n==== NDA government (1998\u20132004) ====\n{{further|National Democratic Alliance}}\n\nA coalition of regional parties formed the government in 1996, but this grouping was short lived, and mid-term polls were held in 1998. The BJP contested the elections leading a coalition called the [[National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA), which contained its existing allies like the [[Samata Party]], the [[Shiromani Akali Dal]], the [[Shiv Sena]] in addition to the [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (AIADMK) and the [[Biju Janata Dal]]. Among these regional parties, the Shiv Sena was the only one which had an ideology similar to the BJP; [[Amartya Sen]], for example, called the coalition an \"ad hoc\" grouping.{{sfn|Jones|2013}}{{sfn|Sen|2005|p=254}} The NDA had a majority with outside support from the [[Telugu Desam Party]] (TDP) and Vajpayee returned as Prime Minister.{{sfn|rediff.com|1998}} However, the coalition ruptured in May 1999 when the leader of AIADMK, [[Jayalalitha]], withdrew her support, and fresh elections were held again.{{sfn|Outlook|2013}}\n\nOn 13 October 1999, the NDA, without the AIADMK, won 303 seats in parliament and thus an outright majority. The BJP had its highest ever tally of 183. Vajpayee became Prime Minister for the third time; Advani became Deputy Prime Minister and [[Minister for Home Affairs (India)|Home Minister]]. This NDA government lasted its full term of five years. Its policy agenda included a more aggressive stance on defence and terror as well as [[neo-liberalism|neo-liberal]] economic policies.{{sfn|Sen|2005|pp=251\u2013272}}\n\nIn 2001, [[Bangaru Laxman]], then the BJP president, was filmed accepting a bribe of {{INRConvert|100,000|year=2001}}{{sfn|Outlook|2012}} to recommend the purchase of hand-held thermal imagers for the Indian Army to the Defence Ministry, in [[Operation West End|a sting operation by ''Tehelka'' journalists]].{{sfn|Kattakayam|2012}}{{sfn|India Today|2001}} The BJP was forced to make him resign and he was subsequently prosecuted.

There is a significant range of economic ideologies within the party. In the 1980s, like the Jana Sangh, it reflected the thinking of the RSS and its affiliates. It supported ''[[swadeshi]]'' (the promotion of indigenous industries and products) and a [[protectionist|protectionist export policy]]. However, it supported internal [[economic liberalisation]], and opposed the state-driven industrialisation favoured by the Congress.{{sfn|Shulman|2000|pp=365\u2013390}}\n\nDuring the 1996 elections, the BJP shifted its stance away from protectionism and towards [[globalisation]]; its election manifesto recommended increasing foreign investment in priority sectors, while restricting it in others. When the party was in power in 1998, it shifted its policy even further in favour of globalisation. The tenure of the NDA saw an unprecedented influx of foreign companies in India.{{sfn|Shulman|2000|pp=365\u2013390}} This was criticised by the left parties and the BJP's affiliates (the RSS and the Swadeshi Jagran Manch).{{sfn|Shulman|2000|pp=365\u2013390}} The communist parties said that the BJP was attempting to appease the [[World Bank]] and the United States government through its [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] policies.{{sfn|Shulman|2000|pp=365\u2013390}} Similarly, the RSS stated that the BJP was not being true to its ''swadeshi'' ideology.{{sfn|Shulman|2000|pp=365\u2013390}}\n\nThe two NDA governments in the period 1998\u20132004 introduced significant deregulation and privatisation of government owned enterprises. It also introduced tariff-reducing measures. These reforms built off of the initial economic liberalisation introduced by the Congress government in the early 1990s.{{sfn|Tiwari|2012}} India's GDP growth increased substantially during the tenure of the NDA. The 2004 campaign slogan [[India Shining]] was based on the party's belief that the free market would bring prosperity to all sectors of society.{{sfn|Guha|2007|pp=710\u2013720}} After its unexpected defeat, commentators said that it was punished for neglecting the needs of the poor and focusing too much on its corporate allies.{{sfn|Ramesh|2004}}{{sfn|The Hindu|2004}}{{sfn|Sen|2005|p=70}}\n\nThis shift in the economic policies of the BJP was also visible in state governments, especially in Gujarat, where the BJP held power for 16 years.{{sfn|Sheela Bhatt|2014}} Modi's government, in power from 2002 to 2014, followed a strongly neo-liberal agenda, presented as a drive towards development.{{sfn|Bobbio|2012|pp=652\u2013668}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2013|pp=79\u201395}} Its policies have included extensive privatisation of infrastructure and services, as well as a significant rollback of labour and environmental regulations. While this was praised by the business community, commentators criticised it as catering to the BJP's upper class constituency instead of the poor.{{sfn|Bobbio|2012|pp=652\u2013668}}\n\nUpon his election as Prime Minister in 2014, Modi has largely continued the reformist approach of the last two NDA governments, but unlike Vajpayee, \"prefers to bill himself as a messiah of the poor, and not as an economic liberaliser\".<ref>{{Cite web|work=[[Swarajya (magazine)|Swarajya]]|title=Atal Bihari Vajpayee, The Man Who Mainstreamed BJP And Bharatiyata|date=16 August 2018|url=https://swarajyamag.com/politics/atal-bihari-vajpayee-the-man-who-mainstreamed-bjp-and-bharatiyata}}</ref> Modi has been described as taking a more economically [[populist]] approach on healthcare and agricultural policy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Modi-rolls-out-his-populist-plans-with-a-second-term-in-mind|work=[[The Nikkei]]|title=Modi rolls out his populist plans with a second term in mind}}</ref>\n\n=== Defence and counterterrorism ===\nCompared to the Congress, the BJP takes a more aggressive and nationalistic position on defence policy and terrorism.{{sfn|Ganguly|1999|pp=148\u2013177}}{{sfn|Krishnan|2004|pp=1\u201337}} The Vajpayee-led NDA government carried out nuclear weapons tests, and enacted the [[Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002|Prevention of Terrorism Act]], which later came under heavy criticism.{{sfn|Ganguly|1999|pp=148\u2013177}}{{sfn|Krishnan|2004|pp=1\u201337}} It also deployed troops to evict infiltrators from Kargil, and supported the United States' [[War on Terror]].{{sfn|Kux|2002|pp=93\u2013106}}\n\nAlthough previous Congress governments developed the capability for a nuclear weapons test, the Vajpayee government broke with India's historical strategy of avoiding it and authorised [[Pokhran-II]], a series of five nuclear tests in 1998.{{sfn|Ganguly|1999|pp=148\u2013177}} The tests came soon after Pakistan tested a medium-range ballistic missile. They were seen as an attempt to display India's military prowess to the world, and a reflection of anti-Pakistan sentiment within the BJP.{{sfn|Ganguly|1999|pp=148\u2013177}}\n\nThe Vajpayee government ordered the Indian armed forces to expel the Pakistani soldiers occupying [[Kashmir]] territory, later known as the [[Kargil War]].{{sfn|Qadir|2002|pp=1\u201310}}{{sfn|Abbas|2004|p=173}} Although the government was later criticised for the intelligence failures that did not detect Pakistani presence, it was successful in ousting them from the previously Indian-controlled territory.{{sfn|Qadir|2002|pp=1\u201310}}{{sfn|Abbas|2004|p=173}} The Vajpayee administration also offered political support to the US War on Terror, in the hope of better addressing India's issues with terrorism and insurgency in Kashmir. This led to closer defence ties with the US, including negotiations for the sale of weapons.{{sfn|Kux|2002|pp=93\u2013106}}\n\nAfter the [[2001 Indian Parliament attack|terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament]] in December 2001, the NDA government passed the Prevention of Terrorism Act.{{sfn|Krishnan|2004|pp=1\u201337}} The aim of the act was to improve the government's ability to deal with terrorism.{{sfn|Krishnan|2004|pp=1\u201337}} It initially failed to pass in the [[Rajya Sabha]]; therefore, the NDA took the extraordinary step of convening a [[Joint session|joint session of the Parliament]], where the numerical superior [[Lok Sabha]] allowed the bill to pass.{{sfn|Krishnan|2004|pp=1\u201337}} The act was subsequently used to prosecute hundreds of people accused of terrorism.{{sfn|Krishnan|2004|pp=1\u201337}} However, it was criticised by opposition parties and scholars for being an infringement upon [[civil liberties]], and the [[National Human Rights Commission of India]] stated that it had been used to target Muslims.{{sfn|Krishnan|2004|pp=1\u201337}} It was later repealed by the Congress-led UPA government in 2004.{{sfn|Times of India|2002}}\n\n=== Foreign policy ===\nThe historical stance of the BJP towards [[foreign policy]], like the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, was based on an aggressive [[Hindu nationalism]] combined with economic protectionism.{{sfn|Chaulia|2002|pp=215\u2013234}} The Bharatiya Jana Sangh was founded with the explicit aim of reversing the [[partition of India]]; as a result, its official position was that the existence of Pakistan was illegitimate.{{sfn|Chaulia|2002|pp=215\u2013234}} This antagonism toward Pakistan remains a significant influence on the BJP's ideology.{{sfn|Chaulia|2002|pp=215\u2013234}}{{sfn|Harris|2005|pp=7\u201327}} During the Cold War, the party and its affiliates strongly opposed India's long standing policy of [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-alignment]], and instead advocated closeness to the [[United States]].{{sfn|Chaulia|2002|pp=215\u2013234}}\n\nThe Vajpayee government's foreign policy in many ways represented a radical shift from BJP orthodoxy, while maintaining some aspects of it.{{sfn|Shulman|2000|pp=365\u2013390}}{{sfn|Harris|2005|pp=7\u201327}} Its policy also represented a significant change from the [[Jawaharlal Nehru#Foreign policies|Nehruvian idealism]] of previous governments, opting instead for realism.{{sfn|Lall|2006}} His party criticised him for adopting a much more moderate stance with Pakistan.

In this more defensive role, his performances led to comparison with former German [[Sweeper (association football)|sweeper]] [[Franz Beckenbauer]] and likened his tendency to progress forward in possession, and ability to play-make, from defense to the German legend.<ref>[https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2018/7/7/17542760/profiling-barcelona-target-frenkie-de-jong Profiling Barcelona target Frenkie de Jong] Barca Blaugranes. 7 July 2018.

An extraordinary game-reader, he often makes offensive runs through the middle.\n\nHis other attributes include a penchant for long cross-field passes, creating space, and absorbing attacking pressure. His close control, accuracy, work rate, and movement has drawn comparisons with [[Andr\u00e9s Iniesta]] and [[Johan Cruyff]].

A natural passer, de Jong had a 91.4 percent pass accuracy, in all competitions, during his last season with Ajax. An extraordinary game-reader, he often makes offensive runs through the middle.\n\nHis other attributes include a penchant for long cross-field passes, creating space, and absorbing attacking pressure. His close control, accuracy, work rate, and movement has drawn comparisons with [[Andr\u00e9s Iniesta]] and [[Johan Cruyff]]. At Barcelona, he has primarily played on either side of a three-man central midfield. This has led experts and former players regard him as a player with \"Bar\u00e7a DNA\" who was \"born to play for Barcelona.\"<ref name=\"sensation\" />\n\n== Personal life ==\nDe Jong was born in [[Gorinchem]] and grew up in [[Arkel]], a town in South Holland, where he started playing football at a young age. Since he started playing professionally, De Jong has chosen 21 on his shirt as a tribute to his grandfather, who was born on 21 April.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{in lang|nl}} [https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2019/04/26/frenkie-goes-to-barcelona-a3958330 Frenkie goes to Barcelona] NRC Handelsblad, 26 april 2019</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/06/frenkie-de-jong-ajax-manchester-city-barcelona|title=Ajax\u2019s Frenkie de Jong: 'I try to have a picture of where everyone is'|last=Steinberg|first=Jacob|date=2018-12-06|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-11-26|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> He has a girlfriend named Mikky Kiemeny.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sportbible.com/football/reactions-news-take-a-bow-frenkie-de-jongs-girlfriend-has-been-there-since-day-one-20190706|title=Frenkie De Jong's Girlfriend Mikky Kiemeney Has Been There Since Day One|website=www.sportbible.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\n==Career statistics==\n===Club===\n{{updated|match played 7 March 2020}}<ref name=sw/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Continental<sup>1</sup>\n!colspan=\"2\"|Other<sup>2</sup>\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[Willem II (football club)|Willem II]]\n|[[2014\u201315 Willem II season|2014\u201315]]\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Eredivisie]]\n|1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||1||0\n|-\n|[[2015\u201316 Eredivisie|2015\u201316]]\n|1||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||2||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" |Total\n!2!!0!!1!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!3!!0\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[Jong Ajax]]\n|[[2015\u201316 Eerste Divisie|2015\u201316]]\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Eerste Divisie]]\n|15||2||colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||15||2\n|-\n|[[2016\u201317 Eerste Divisie|2016\u201317]]\n|31||6||colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||31||6\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!46!!8!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!46!!8\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|[[AFC Ajax|Ajax]]\n|[[2016\u201317 AFC Ajax season|2016\u201317]]\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[Eredivisie]]\n|4||1||3||0||4||0||0||0||11||1\n|-\n|[[2017\u201318 AFC Ajax season|2017\u201318]]\n|22||0||2||0||2||0||0||0||26||0\n|-\n|[[2018\u201319 AFC Ajax season|2018\u201319]]\n|31||4||4||0||17||0||0||0||52||4\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!57!!5!!9!!0!!23!!0!!0!!0!!89!!5\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|[[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]\n|[[2019\u201320 FC Barcelona season|2019\u201320]]\n|rowspan=\"1\"|[[La Liga]]\n|26||2||3||0||7||0||1||0||37||2\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"|Career total\n!131!!15!!13!!0!!30!!0!!1!!0!!175!!15\n|}\n:<small><sup>1</sup> Includes [[UEFA Champions League]] and [[UEFA Europa League]] matches.</small>\n:<small><sup>2</sup> Includes [[Johan Cruijff Shield]] and [[Eredivisie#Playoffs|Eredivisie playoffs]] matches.</small>\n\n===International===\n{{updated|match played 19 November 2019}}<ref name=sw/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]\n|-\n|2018||5||0\n|-\n|2019||10||1\n|-\n!colspan=2|Total!!15!!1\n|}\n\n====International goals====\n:''As of match played 6 September 2019.
