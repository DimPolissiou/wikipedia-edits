Previous to 2005 the building had been used for a long time for only funerals. Its size counted against it, as the church divided several times after its being built, starting with the [[Free_Church_of_Scotland_(1843\u20131900)|division]] between the Church of Scotland and the Free Church. The large kirk was no longer needed as other churches were built in the village. In addition to East Kirk and the old East Kirk, there are four more churches in Lochcarron, three currently active. The East Kirk was always notoriously hard to heat with 30 inch thick stone walls, and most remember it as a very cold building to be in. Hence, over its later life the building was rather neglected. From 2005 to 2018 it was left mostly untouched after that owner removed the pews, organ and plaster walls. All this was burnt. In 2018 it changed hands again and it now in a process of renovation. The current owners intend to restore it to original condition, although the roof has \"nail sickness\" and needs attention first. <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lochcarronchurch.com/about/|title=Lochcarronchurh.com|website=lochcarronchurch.com/about/|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.
