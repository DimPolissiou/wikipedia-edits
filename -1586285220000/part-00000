{"title_page": "Separation of church and state", "text_new": "{{Status of religious freedom|expanded=concepts}}\nThe '''separation of church and state''' is a philosophic and [[Jurisprudence|jurisprudential]] concept for defining political distance in the relationship between [[religious organizations]] and the [[nation state]]. Conceptually, the term refers to the creation of a [[secular state]] (with or without legally explicit church\u2013state separation) and to disestablishment, the changing of an existing, formal relationship between the church and the state.<ref>''The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States'' (1992), Kermit D. Hall, Ed. pp. 717\u201326</ref>\n\nIn a society, the degree of political separation between the church and the civil state is determined by the legal structures and prevalent legal views that define the proper relationship between organized religion and the state. The [[arm's length principle]] proposes a relationship wherein the two political entities interact as organizations each independent of the authority of the other. The strict application of the secular principle of ''[[la\u00efcit\u00e9]]'' ([[secularity]]) is used in [[France]], while secular societies, such as [[Denmark]] and the [[United Kingdom]], maintain a form of constitutional recognition of an official [[state religion]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelocal.no/page/view/norway-separates-church-and-state#.UPFSb-Q0VPE|title=Norway separates church and state|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe philosophy of the separation of the church from the civil state parallels the philosophies of [[secularism]], [[disestablishmentarianism]], [[religious liberty]], and [[religious pluralism]], by way of which the European states assumed some of the social roles of the church, the [[welfare state]], a social shift that produced a culturally secular population and [[public sphere]].<ref>''[http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=separationism Separationism]'', [http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn Princeton University WordNet] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508073028/http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn |date=May 8, 2016 }} reads: \"separationism: advocacy of a policy of strict separation of church and state.\"</ref> In practice, church\u2013state separation varies from total separation, mandated by the country's political [[constitution]], as in [[Religion in India|India]] and [[Religion in Singapore|Singapore]], to a state religion, as in [[Freedom of religion in the Maldives|the Maldives]].\n\n==History of the concept and term==\n{{More citations needed| date = August 2016}}\n\n===Late antiquity===\n[[File:Carlo Crivelli - St. Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|''St. Augustine'' by [[Carlo Crivelli]]]]\nAn important contributor to the discussion concerning the proper relationship between Church and state was St. [[Augustine]], who in ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'', Book XIX, Chapter 17, examined the ideal relationship between the \"earthly city\" and the \"city of God\". In this work, Augustine posited that major points of overlap were to be found between the \"earthly city\" and the \"city of God\", especially as people need to live together and get along on earth.  Thus, Augustine held that it was the work of the \"temporal city\" to make it possible for a \"heavenly city\" to be established on earth.<ref>Feldman (2009)</ref>\n\n===Medieval Europe===\n{{Main|Church and state in medieval Europe}}\nFor centuries, monarchs ruled by the idea of [[divine right of kings|divine right]]. Sometimes this began to be used by a monarch to support the notion that the king ruled both his own kingdom and Church within its boundaries, a theory known as [[caesaropapism]]. On the other side was the Catholic doctrine that the [[Bishop of Rome|Pope]], as the Vicar of Christ on earth, should have the ultimate authority over the Church, and indirectly over the state. Moreover, throughout the Middle Ages the [[Pope]] claimed the right to depose the Catholic kings of Western Europe and tried to exercise it, sometimes successfully (see the investiture controversy, below), sometimes not, such as was the case with [[Henry VIII of England]] and [[Henry IV of France|Henry III]] of [[Navarre]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/delineationroma01elligoog |title=Delineation of Roman Catholicism: Drawn from the authentic and acknowledged standards of the Church of Rome|publisher=Lane & Scott |first=Charles|last=Elliott|year=1877|page=[https://archive.org/details/delineationroma01elligoog/page/n169 165] |origyear=1851}}</ref>\n\nIn the West the issue of the separation of church and state during the medieval period centered on monarchs who [[sphere sovereignty|ruled in the secular sphere]] but encroached on the Church's rule of the spiritual sphere. This unresolved contradiction in ultimate control of the Church led to power struggles and crises of leadership, notably in the [[Investiture Controversy]], which was resolved in the [[Concordat of Worms]] in 1122. By this concordat, the Emperor renounced the right to invest ecclesiastics with ring and crosier, the symbols of their spiritual power, and guaranteed election by the canons of cathedral or abbey and free consecration.<ref>{{cite book |last= Berman |first= Harold J. |title= Law and Revolution: The Formation of the Western Legal Tradition |url= https://archive.org/details/lawrevolutionfor0000berm |url-access= registration |publisher= Harvard University Press |year= 1983 |isbn= 0-674-51774-1 |oclc= 185405865 }}</ref>\n\n===Reformation===\nAt the beginning of the Protestant [[Reformation]], [[Martin Luther]] articulated a [[doctrine of the two kingdoms]].

Some of these people voluntarily sailed to the American Colonies specifically for this purpose.

For Locke, this created a natural right in the liberty of conscience, which he argued must therefore remain protected from any government authority. These views on religious tolerance and the importance of individual conscience, along with his social contract, became particularly influential in the American colonies and the drafting of the [[United States Constitution]].<ref>Feldman, Noah (2005).

In that letter, referencing the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], Jefferson writes:\n\n<blockquote>Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, & not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus building a wall of separation between Church and State.<ref name=Jefferson11>{{cite web| url = https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9806/danpre.html| title = Jefferson's Letter to the Danbury Baptists| accessdate = 2006-11-30| last = Jefferson| first = Thomas| date = 1802-01-01| publisher = U.S. Library of Congress}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nJefferson was describing to the Baptists that the [[United States Bill of Rights]] prevents the establishment of a national church, and in so doing they did not have to fear government interference in their right to expressions of religious conscience. The Bill of Rights, adopted in 1791 as ten amendments to the [[Constitution of the United States]], was one of the earliest political expressions of religious freedom.  Others were the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]], also authored by Jefferson and adopted by Virginia in 1786; and the French [[Declaration of the Rights of the Man and of the Citizen of 1789]].\n\n==In various countries==\n{{See also|Secular state|La\u00efcit\u00e9|Secularism|Pseudo-Secularism|Secular humanism}}\nCountries have varying degrees of separation between government and religious institutions.

Powers to appoint high-ranking members of the state churches are also often still vested in the worldly governments. These powers may be slightly anachronistic or superficial, however, and disguise the true level of religious freedom the nation possesses.  In the case of Andorra there are two heads of state, neither of them native Andorrans. One is the Roman Catholic Bishop of Seu de Urgell, a town located in northern Spain. He has the title of Episcopalian Coprince (the other Coprince being the French Head of State).

Principle of separation of church and state is enshrined in Article 41 which states:\n\n<blockquote>All religious communities shall be equal before the law and clearly separated from the state. Religious communities shall be free, in compliance with law, to publicly conduct religious services, open schools, academies or other institutions, and welfare and charitable organizations and to manage them, and they shall enjoy the protection and assistance of the state in their activities.</blockquote>\n\nPublic schools allow religious teaching ({{lang-hr|Vjeronauk}}) in cooperation with religious communities having agreements with the state, but attendance is not mandated. Religion classes are organized widely in public elementary and secondary schools.\n\nThe public holidays also include religious festivals of: [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], [[Easter Monday]], [[Corpus Christi Day]], [[Assumption Day]], [[All Saints' Day]], [[Christmas]], and [[Boxing Day]]. The primary holidays are based on the Catholic liturgical year, but other believers are allowed to celebrate other major religious holidays as well.\n\nThe [[Roman Catholic Church in Croatia]] receives state financial support and other benefits established in [[concordat]]s between the Government and the Vatican.

Such inscriptions on a church are very rare; this one was restored during the 1989 bicentennial of the [[French Revolution]].]]\nThe French version of separation of church and state, called [[la\u00efcit\u00e9]], is a product of French history and philosophy. It was formalized in a [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State|1905 law]] providing for the separation of church and state, that is, the separation of religion from political power.\n\nThis model of a secularist state protects the religious institutions from state interference, but with public religious expression to some extent frowned upon. This aims to protect the public power from the influences of religious institutions, especially in public office. Religious views which contain no idea of public responsibility, or which consider religious opinion irrelevant to politics, are not impinged upon by this type of secularization of public discourse.\n\nFormer President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] criticised \"negative la\u00efcit\u00e9\" and talked about a \"positive la\u00efcit\u00e9\" that recognizes the contribution of faith to French culture, history and society, allows for faith in the public discourse and for government subsidies for faith-based groups.<ref name=\"christiantoday.com\">Beita, Peter B.

Catholic priests as well as the clergy of three other religions (the Lutheran [[EPCAAL]], the Calvinist [[EPRAL]], and Jewish [[Consistory (Judaism)|consistories]]) are paid by the state, and schools have religion courses. Moreover, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Metz|Catholic bishops of Metz]] and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Strasbourg|of Strasbourg]] are named (or rather, formally appointed) by the French Head of State on proposition of the Pope. In the same way, the presidents of the two official Protestant churches are appointed by the State, after proposition by their respective Churches. This makes the French President the only temporal power in the world to formally have retained the right to appoint Catholic bishops, all other Catholic bishops being appointed by the Pope.\n* In French Guyana the Royal Regulation of 1828 makes the French state pay for the Roman Catholic clergy, but not for the clergy of other religions.\n* In the French oversea departments and territories since the 1939 d\u00e9cret Mandel the French State supports the Churches.  \n* The French President is ''ex officio'' a [[co-prince of Andorra]], where Roman Catholicism has a status of state religion (the other co-prince being the [[Bishop of Urgell|Roman Catholic Bishop of Seu de Urgell]], Spain). Moreover, French heads of states are traditionally offered an honorary title of [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] of the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran|Papal Archbasilica of St. John Lateran]], Cathedral of Rome. Once this honour has been awarded to a newly elected president, France pays for a ''choir vicar'', a priest who occupies the seat in the canonical chapter of the Cathedral in lieu of the president (all French presidents have been male and at least formally Roman Catholic, but if one were not, this honour could most probably not be awarded to him or her.)  The French President also holds a seat in a few other canonical chapters in France.\n* Another example of the complex ties between France and the Catholic Church consists in the ''Pieux \u00c9tablissements de la France \u00e0 Rome et \u00e0 Lorette'': five churches in Rome ([[Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti]], St. Louis of the French, St. Ivo of the Bretons, St. Claude of the Free County of Burgundy, and St. Nicholas of the Lorrains) as well as a chapel in [[Loreto, Marche|Loreto]] belong to France, and are administered and paid for by a special foundation linked to the French embassy to the Holy See.\n* In [[Wallis and Futuna]], a French overseas territory, national education is conceded to the diocese, which gets paid for it by the State\n* A further entanglement consists in liturgical honours accorded to French consular officials under Capitations with the Ottoman Empire which persist for example in the Lebanon and in ownership of the Catholic cathedral in Smyrna (Izmir) and the extraterritoriality of St. Anne's in Jerusalem and more generally the diplomatic status of the Holy Places.\n\n===Germany===\n{{see also|Religion in Germany}}\n[[File:S95CrucifixCourtroomNuremberg.jpg|thumb|left|Courtroom with Crucifix in Nuremberg, Germany, June 2016]]\nThe [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German constitution]] guarantees [[freedom of religion]],<ref name=\"Section 4 of German Basic Law\">Section 4 of German Basic Law</ref> but there is not a complete separation of church and state in Germany.

The government will still provide funding for the church as it does with other faith-based institutions, but the responsibility for appointing bishops and provosts will now rest with the church instead of the government. Prior to 1997, the appointments of parish priests and residing chaplains was also the responsibility of the government, but the church was granted the right to hire such clergy directly with the new Church Law of 1997. The Church of Norway is regulated by its own law (''kirkeloven'') and all municipalities are required by law to support the activities of the Church of Norway and municipal authorities are represented in its local bodies.<ref>[[Church of Norway#Legal status|\"Church of Norway\"]]</ref>\n\n===Philippines===\n{{main|Religion in the Philippines|Catholic Church in the Philippines}}\nIn Article II \"Declaration of Principles and State Policies\", Section 6, the [[1987 Constitution of the Philippines]] declares, \"The separation of Church and State shall be inviolable.\" This reasserts, with minor differences  in wording and capitalization, a declaration made in Article XV, Section 15 of the 1973 Constitution.<ref name=1987constII>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/the-philippine-constitutions/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines-article-ii/|title=THE 1987 CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES \u2013 ARTICLE II|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref><ref name=1973const>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/the-philippine-constitutions/the-amended-1973-constitution/|title=The Amended 1973 Constitution|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, Article III, Section 5 declares, \"No law shall be made respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.

However, the role of religion in society is regulated by several articles of the Romanian Constitution.\n\nArt 29. Freedom of Conscience. (1) Freedom of thought and opinion, as well as freedom of religion, cannot be limited in any way. No one shall be coerced to adopt an opinion or adhere to a religious faith against their will.\n(5) Religious cults are autonomous in relation to the state, which provides support including the facilitation of religious assistance in the army, hospitals, penitentiaries, retirement homes and orphanages.\n\nArt 32.

In state schools, religious education is organized and guaranteed by law.\n\n===Saudi Arabia===\n{{main|Legal system of Saudi Arabia}}\nThe legal system of Saudi Arabia is based on [[Sharia]], [[Islam]]ic law derived from the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Sunnah]] (the traditions) of the [[Muhammad|Islamic prophet Muhammad]], and therefore no separation of church and state is present.\n\n===Singapore===\n{{main|Religion in Singapore}}\n[[Singapore]] is home to people of many religions and does not have any state religion. The [[government of Singapore]] has attempted to avoid giving any specific religions priority over the rest.\n\nIn 1972 the Singapore government de-registered and banned the activities of Jehovah's Witnesses in Singapore.

Religious freedom was guaranteed only [[1966 Spanish organic law referendum|in 1966]], nine years before the end of the regime.\n\nSince 1978, according to the [[Spanish Constitution]] (section 16.3) \"No religion shall have a state character. The public authorities shall take into account the religious beliefs of Spanish society and shall consequently maintain appropriate cooperation relations with the Catholic Church and other confessions.\"\n\n=== Sweden ===\nThe [[Church of Sweden]] was instigated by [[Gustav I of Sweden|King Gustav I]] (1523\u201360) and within the half century following his death had become established as a [[Lutheran]] state church with significant power in Swedish society, itself under the control of the state apparatus. A degree of freedom of worship (for foreign residents only) was achieved under the rule of [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] (1771\u201392), but it was not until the passage of the Dissenter Acts of 1860 and 1874 that Swedish citizens were allowed to leave the state church \u2013 and then only provided that those wishing to do so first registered their adhesion to another, officially approved denomination. Following years of discussions that began in 1995, the Church of Sweden was finally separated from the state as from 1 January 2000. However, the separation was not fully completed. Although the status of state religion came to an end, the Church of Sweden nevertheless remains Swedens national church, and as such is still regulated by the government through the law of the Church of Sweden. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to refer to a change of relation between state and church rather than a separation. Furthermore, the Swedish constitution still maintain that the Sovereign and the members of the royal family has to confess an evangelical Lutheran faith, which in practice means they need to be members of the Church of Sweden to remain in the line of succession. Thusly according to the ideas of [[cuius regio, eius religio]] one could argue that the symbolic connection between state and church still remains.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/januaryweb-only/11.0.html|title=Swedish Church State Separate|magazine=Christianity Today|first=Ted|last=Olsen|date=1 January 2000|accessdate=27 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Switzerland ===\n{{Main|Religion in Switzerland}}\nThe articles 8 (\"Equality before the law\") and 15 (\"Freedom of religion and conscience\") of the [[Federal Constitution of the Swiss Confederation]] guarantees individual freedom of beliefs.<ref name=CstCH>[https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19995395/index.html Federal Constitution of the Swiss Confederation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621000507/https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19995395/index.html |date=June 21, 2016 }}, status as of 14 June 2015, [[Federal Chancellery of Switzerland]] (page visited on 17 December 2015).</ref> It notably states that \" No person may be forced to join or belong to a religious community, to participate in a religious act or to follow religious teachings\".<ref name=CstCH/>\n\nChurches and state are separated at the federal level since 1848.

The State has a Department of Religious Affairs, directly under the Prime Minister bureaucratically, responsible for organizing the [[Sunni]] Muslim religion \u2013 including what will and will not be mentioned in sermons given at [[mosque]]s, especially on Fridays. Such an interpretation of secularism, where religion is under strict control of the State is very different from that of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], and is a good example of how secularism can be applied in a variety of ways in different regions of the world.\nThe exercise of their religion in Turkey by the Greek Orthodox and the Armenian Apostolic communities is partly regulated by the terms of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]]. No such official recognition extends to the Syriac communities.\n\nUnder [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]]'s tenure since 2003, Turkish secularism has come under heavy fire as a new [[Islamist]] [[right-wing populist]] mood has overtaken Turkish politics. Erdo\u011fan has pursued a suite of policies determined to give state backing to particular interpretations of Islam.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe [[Church of England]], a part of the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]], is an [[established church]], and the [[British monarchy|British Sovereign]] is the titular [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|Supreme Governor]], and cannot be a Roman Catholic. Until the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]], the monarch could not be married to a Catholic.\n\nIn state-run schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland (but not in privately run schools), there is a requirement for a daily act of worship that is \"wholly or mainly of a Christian character\", although non-Christian faith schools are exempt (instead having to have their own form of worship) and sixth-form pupils (in England and Wales) and parents of younger pupils can opt out.

The Lords Spiritual have a significant influence when they vote as a bloc on certain issues, notably moral issues like abortion and [[euthanasia]]. All of state-funded schools in England are religious school, too, and most are controlled by the Church of England, with significant numbers of state-funded Catholic, Muslim, and Jewish schools as well. The Anglican Church also has specific legal rights and responsibilities in solemnised marriages that are different from other faith organisations. Non-religious couples can have a [[civil wedding]] with no religious elements, but non-religious [[humanist celebrant|humanist weddings]] are not yet legally recognised in their own right.

However, though the Kirk is disestablished, Scotland is not a secular polity. The Kirk remains a [[national church]] to which the state has special obligations; it is conventional that the monarch, who is head of state, must attend the Church when she visits Scotland, and they swear in their accession oath to maintain and preserve the church. The state also gives numerous preferences to the Church of Scotland and Catholic Church, particularly in education. The [[blasphemy law]] has not been abolished in Scotland, though it has fallen into disuse. Non-religious couples can have a [[civil wedding]] with no religious elements, and [[humanist celebrant|humanist weddings]] have been legally recognised since 2005, and enshrined in Scottish law since 2017.

[T]his is a Christian nation.\"<ref name=\"Finkelman\">{{cite book |last1=Finkelman |first1=Paul |title=Religion and American Law: An Encyclopedia |date=2003 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781136919565 |page=76 |language=English}}</ref>\n\nLegal historian [[Paul Finkelman]] writes that: \n{{quotation|Brewer, the son of a Congregationalist missionary to Asia Minor, quoted several colonial charters, state constitutions, and court decisions that referred to the importance of Christian belief in the affairs of the American people; cited the practice of various legislative bodies of beginning their sessions with prayer, and noted the large number of churches and Christian charitable organizations that exist in every community in the country as evidence that this is a Christian nation. In doing so, Brewer expressed the prevailing nineteenth-century Protestant view that America is a Christian nation.<ref name=\"Finkelman\"/>}}\n\n====Use of the phrase====\nThe phrase \"separation of church and state\" is derived from a letter written by President [[Thomas Jefferson]] in 1802 to  [[Danbury Baptists|Baptists from Danbury, Connecticut]], and published in a Massachusetts newspaper soon thereafter. In that letter, referencing the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], Jefferson writes:\n\n{{quote|Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, & not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\", thus building a wall of separation between Church & State.<ref name=Jefferson11 />}}\n\nAnother early user of the term was [[James Madison]], the principal drafter of the [[United States Bill of Rights]].  In a 1789 debate in the House of Representatives regarding the draft of the First Amendment, the following was said:\n\n{{quote|August 15, 1789. Mr. [Peter] Sylvester [of New York] had some doubts. \u2026 He feared it [the First Amendment] might be thought to have a tendency to abolish religion altogether. \u2026 Mr. [Elbridge] Gerry [of Massachusetts] said it would read better if it was that \"no religious doctrine shall be established by law.\" \u2026 Mr. [James] Madison [of Virginia] said he apprehended the meaning of the words to be, that \"Congress should not establish a religion, and enforce the legal observation of it by law.\" \u2026 [T]he State[s] \u2026 seemed to entertain an opinion that under the clause of the Constitution. \u2026 it enabled them [Congress] to make laws of such a nature as might \u2026 establish a national religion; to prevent these effects he presumed the amendment was intended. \u2026 Mr. Madison thought if the word \"National\" was inserted before religion, it would satisfy the minds of honorable gentlemen. \u2026 He thought if the word \"national\" was introduced, it would point the amendment directly to the object it was intended to prevent.<ref>''Debates and Proceedings in the Congress of the United States'' (Washington, D.C.: Gales & Seaton, 1834, Vol. I pp. 757\u201359, August 15, 1789</ref>}}\n\nMadison contended \"Because if Religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendI_religions43.html |title=James Madison, Memorial and Remonstrance against Religious Assessments |publisher=Press-pubs.uchicago.edu |accessdate=2012-04-27}}</ref> Several years later he wrote of \"total separation of the church from the state\".<ref>(March 2, 1819 letter to [[Robert Walsh (diplomat)|Robert Walsh]]), {{cite book|last=Lambert|first=Frank|title=The founding fathers and the place of religion in America|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2003|page=[https://archive.org/details/foundin_lam_2003_00_2547/page/288 288]|isbn=978-0-691-08829-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1qse4fZ6eQgC|ref=harv}}</ref> \"Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion & Govt in the Constitution of the United States\", Madison wrote,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/jm/18191213_monopolies.htm|title=Monopolies Perpetuities Corporations \u2013 Ecclesiastical Endowments|first=James|last=Madison|publisher=constitution.org|accessdate=2008-06-16|ref=harv}}</ref> and he declared, \"practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government is essential to the purity of both, and as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States.\"<ref>(1811 letter to Baptist Churches)</ref> In a letter to [[Edward Livingston]] Madison further expanded,\n\n<blockquote>We are teaching the world the great truth that Govts. do better without Kings & Nobles than with them.

The inscription, as he stipulated, reads, \"Here was buried Thomas Jefferson, author of ... the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom|Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom]] ....\"]]\nThis attitude is further reflected in the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]], originally authored by Jefferson and championed by Madison, and guaranteeing that no one may be compelled to finance any religion or denomination.\n\n{{quote|\u2026 no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinion in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.<ref>J. F. Maclear, ''Church and state in the modern age: a documentary history'' (1995) p. 65</ref>}}\n\nUnder the [[United States Constitution]], the treatment of religion by the government is broken into two clauses: the [[establishment clause]] and the [[free exercise clause]].  Both are discussed in regard to whether certain state actions would amount to an impermissible government establishment of religion.\n\nThe phrase was also mentioned in an eloquent letter written by President [[John Tyler]] on July 10, 1843.<ref>Tyler wrote, \"The United States have adventured upon a great and noble experiment, which is believed to have been hazarded in the absence of all previous precedent \u2013 that of total separation of Church and State. No religious establishment by law exists among us. The conscience is left free from all restraint and each is permitted to worship his Maker after his own judgment. The offices of the Government are open alike to all. No tithes are levied to support an established Hierarchy, nor is the fallible judgment of man set up as the sure and infallible creed of faith. The Mahommedan, if he will to come among us would have the privilege guaranteed to him by the constitution to worship according to the Koran; and the East Indian might erect a shrine to Brahma if it so pleased him. Such is the spirit of toleration inculcated by our political Institutions . \u2026 The Hebrew persecuted and down trodden in other regions takes up his abode among us with none to make him afraid . \u2026 and the Aegis of the Government is over him to defend and protect him. Such is the great experiment which we have cried, and such are the happy fruits which have resulted from it; our system of free government would be imperfect without it.\") quoted in Nicole Gu\u00e9tin, ''Religious ideology in American politics: a history'' (2009) p. 85</ref> During the 1960 presidential campaign the potential influence of the Catholic Church on John F. Kennedy's presidency was raised. If elected, it would be the first time that a Catholic would occupy the highest office in the United States. [[John F. Kennedy]], in his [[s:Address of Senator John F. Kennedy to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association|Address to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association]] on 12 September 1960, addressed the question directly, saying,\n\n{{quote|I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute \u2013 where no Catholic prelate would tell the President (should he be Catholic) how to act, and no Protestant minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote \u2013 where no church or church school is granted any public funds or political preference \u2013 and where no man is denied public office merely because his religion differs from the President who might appoint him or the people who might elect him. I believe in an America that is officially neither Catholic, Protestant nor Jewish \u2013 where no public official either requests or accepts instructions on public policy from the Pope, the National Council of Churches or any other ecclesiastical source \u2013 where no religious body seeks to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of its officials \u2013 and where religious liberty is so indivisible that an act against one church is treated as an act against all. [\u2026] I do not speak for my church on public matters \u2013 and the church does not speak for me. Whatever issue may come before me as President \u2013 on birth control, divorce, censorship, gambling or any other subject \u2013 I will make my decision in accordance with these views, in accordance with what my conscience tells me to be the national interest, and without regard to outside religious pressures or dictates. And no power or threat of punishment could cause me to decide otherwise. But if the time should ever come \u2013 and I do not concede any conflict to be even remotely possible \u2013 when my office would require me to either violate my conscience or violate the national interest, then I would resign the office; and I hope any conscientious public servant would do the same.}}\n\nThe United States Supreme Court has referenced the separation of church and state metaphor more than 25 times, though not always fully embracing the principle, saying \"the metaphor itself is not a wholly accurate description of the practical aspects of the relationship that in fact exists between church and state\".<ref>* See [http://supreme.justia.com/us/465/668/case.html ''Lynch v.

United States|Reynolds]]'', the Court denied the free exercise claims of Mormons in the Utah territory who claimed [[polygamy]] was an aspect of their religious freedom.  The Court used the phrase again by Justice Hugo Black in 1947 in ''[[Everson v. Board of Education|Everson]]''. In a minority opinion in ''[[Wallace v. Jaffree]]'', Justice Rehnquist presented the view that the establishment clause was intended to protect local establishments of religion from federal interference.  Rehnquist made numerous citations of cases that rebutted the idea of a total wall of separation between Church and State. A result of such reasoning was Supreme Court support for government payments to faith-based community projects. [[Justice Scalia]] has criticized the metaphor as a bulldozer removing religion from American public life.<ref>[[Lee v. Weisman]], {{ussc|505|577|1992}}</ref>\n\n====Pledge of Allegiance====\nCritics of the American [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]] have argued that the use of the phrase \"under God\" violates the separation of church and state. While the pledge was created by [[Francis Bellamy]] in 1891, in 1954, the [[Knights of Columbus]], a Catholic organization, campaigned with other groups to have the words \"under God\" added to the pledge. On June 14, 1954, President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] signed the bill to make the addition.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-man-who-wrote-the-pledge-of-allegiance-93907224/|title=The Man Who Wrote the Pledge of Allegiance|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en}}</ref>\n\nSince then, critics have challenged the existence of the phrase in the Pledge. In 2004, [[Michael Newdow]], an ordained [[atheist]] minister of the [[Universal Life Church]] challenged a Californian law which required students to recite the pledge. He said the law violated his daughter's right to free speech. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the school system in ''[[Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow]]'', mainly due to the fact that the father could not claim sufficient custody of the child over his ex-wife who was the legal guardian and had opposed the lawsuit. Additionally, the Supreme Court stated that teachers leading students in the pledge was constitutional, and therefore the pledge should stay the same.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-latest-controversy-about-under-god-in-the-pledge-of-allegiance|title=The history of legal challenges to the Pledge of Allegiance \u2013 National Constitution Center|website=[[National Constitution Center]] \u2013 constitutioncenter.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}</ref>\n\n== Religious views ==\n\n===Islam: Ahmadiyya===\n[[File:Liwa-e-Ahmadiyya and Minarat-ul-Massih.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|The [[White Minaret (Qadian)|White Minaret]] and the Ahmadiyya Flag in [[Qadian]], [[India]].]]\nAccording to the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]]'s understanding of [[Islam]], Islamic principles state that the politics of government should be separate from the doctrine of religion.

Monsignor John A. Ryan speaks of this Catholic doctrine thusly: \"If there is only one true religion, and if its possession is the most important good in life, for states as well as individuals, then the public profession, protection, and promotion of this religion, and the legal prohibition of all direct assaults upon it, becomes one of the most obvious and fundamental duties of the state.

Hall, Ed. pp. 717\u201326</ref>\n\nIn a society, the degree of political separation between the church and the civil state is determined by the legal structures and prevalent legal views that define the proper relationship between organized religion and the state. The [[arm's length principle]] proposes a relationship wherein the two political entities interact as organizations each independent of the authority of the other. The strict application of the secular principle of ''[[la\u00efcit\u00e9]]'' ([[secularity]]) is used in [[France]], while secular societies, such as [[Denmark]] and the [[United Kingdom]], maintain a form of constitutional recognition of an official [[state religion]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelocal.no/page/view/norway-separates-church-and-state#.UPFSb-Q0VPE|title=Norway separates church and state|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe philosophy of the separation of the church from the civil state parallels the philosophies of [[secularism]], [[disestablishmentarianism]], [[religious liberty]], and [[religious pluralism]], by way of which the European states assumed some of the social roles of the church, the [[welfare state]], a social shift that produced a culturally secular population and [[public sphere]].<ref>''[http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=separationism Separationism]'', [http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn Princeton University WordNet] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508073028/http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn |date=May 8, 2016 }} reads: \"separationism: advocacy of a policy of strict separation of church and state.\"</ref> In practice, church\u2013state separation varies from total separation, mandated by the country's political [[constitution]], as in [[Religion in India|India]] and [[Religion in Singapore|Singapore]], to a state religion, as in [[Freedom of religion in the Maldives|the Maldives]].\n\n==History of the concept and term==\n{{More citations needed| date = August 2016}}\n\n===Late antiquity===\n[[File:Carlo Crivelli - St. Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|''St. Augustine'' by [[Carlo Crivelli]]]]\nAn important contributor to the discussion concerning the proper relationship between Church and state was St. [[Augustine]], who in ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'', Book XIX, Chapter 17, examined the ideal relationship between the \"earthly city\" and the \"city of God\". In this work, Augustine posited that major points of overlap were to be found between the \"earthly city\" and the \"city of God\", especially as people need to live together and get along on earth.  Thus, Augustine held that it was the work of the \"temporal city\" to make it possible for a \"heavenly city\" to be established on earth.<ref>Feldman (2009)</ref>\n\n===Medieval Europe===\n{{Main|Church and state in medieval Europe}}\nFor centuries, monarchs ruled by the idea of [[divine right of kings|divine right]]. Sometimes this began to be used by a monarch to support the notion that the king ruled both his own kingdom and Church within its boundaries, a theory known as [[caesaropapism]]. On the other side was the Catholic doctrine that the [[Bishop of Rome|Pope]], as the Vicar of Christ on earth, should have the ultimate authority over the Church, and indirectly over the state. Moreover, throughout the Middle Ages the [[Pope]] claimed the right to depose the Catholic kings of Western Europe and tried to exercise it, sometimes successfully (see the investiture controversy, below), sometimes not, such as was the case with [[Henry VIII of England]] and [[Henry IV of France|Henry III]] of [[Navarre]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/delineationroma01elligoog |title=Delineation of Roman Catholicism: Drawn from the authentic and acknowledged standards of the Church of Rome|publisher=Lane & Scott |first=Charles|last=Elliott|year=1877|page=[https://archive.org/details/delineationroma01elligoog/page/n169 165] |origyear=1851}}</ref>\n\nIn the West the issue of the separation of church and state during the medieval period centered on monarchs who [[sphere sovereignty|ruled in the secular sphere]] but encroached on the Church's rule of the spiritual sphere. This unresolved contradiction in ultimate control of the Church led to power struggles and crises of leadership, notably in the [[Investiture Controversy]], which was resolved in the [[Concordat of Worms]] in 1122. By this concordat, the Emperor renounced the right to invest ecclesiastics with ring and crosier, the symbols of their spiritual power, and guaranteed election by the canons of cathedral or abbey and free consecration.<ref>{{cite book |last= Berman |first= Harold J. |title= Law and Revolution: The Formation of the Western Legal Tradition |url= https://archive.org/details/lawrevolutionfor0000berm |url-access= registration |publisher= Harvard University Press |year= 1983 |isbn= 0-674-51774-1 |oclc= 185405865 }}</ref>\n\n===Reformation===\nAt the beginning of the Protestant [[Reformation]], [[Martin Luther]] articulated a [[doctrine of the two kingdoms]].

In that letter, referencing the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], Jefferson writes:\n\n<blockquote>Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, & not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus building a wall of separation between Church and State.<ref name=Jefferson11>{{cite web| url = https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9806/danpre.html| title = Jefferson's Letter to the Danbury Baptists| accessdate = 2006-11-30| last = Jefferson| first = Thomas| date = 1802-01-01| publisher = U.S. Library of Congress}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nJefferson was describing to the Baptists that the [[United States Bill of Rights]] prevents the establishment of a national church, and in so doing they did not have to fear government interference in their right to expressions of religious conscience. The Bill of Rights, adopted in 1791 as ten amendments to the [[Constitution of the United States]], was one of the earliest political expressions of religious freedom.  Others were the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]], also authored by Jefferson and adopted by Virginia in 1786; and the French [[Declaration of the Rights of the Man and of the Citizen of 1789]].\n\n==In various countries==\n{{See also|Secular state|La\u00efcit\u00e9|Secularism|Pseudo-Secularism|Secular humanism}}\nCountries have varying degrees of separation between government and religious institutions.  Since the 1780s  a number of countries have set up explicit barriers between church and state. The degree of actual separation between government and religion or religious institutions varies widely.  In some countries the two institutions remain heavily interconnected.

Powers to appoint high-ranking members of the state churches are also often still vested in the worldly governments. These powers may be slightly anachronistic or superficial, however, and disguise the true level of religious freedom the nation possesses.  In the case of Andorra there are two heads of state, neither of them native Andorrans. One is the Roman Catholic Bishop of Seu de Urgell, a town located in northern Spain. He has the title of Episcopalian Coprince (the other Coprince being the French Head of State). Coprinces enjoy political power in terms of law ratification and constitutional court designation, among others.\n\n===Australia===\n[[File:Hbhiggins.jpg|thumb|right|[[H. B.

Religious communities shall be free, in compliance with law, to publicly conduct religious services, open schools, academies or other institutions, and welfare and charitable organizations and to manage them, and they shall enjoy the protection and assistance of the state in their activities.</blockquote>\n\nPublic schools allow religious teaching ({{lang-hr|Vjeronauk}}) in cooperation with religious communities having agreements with the state, but attendance is not mandated.

It was formalized in a [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State|1905 law]] providing for the separation of church and state, that is, the separation of religion from political power.\n\nThis model of a secularist state protects the religious institutions from state interference, but with public religious expression to some extent frowned upon. This aims to protect the public power from the influences of religious institutions, especially in public office. Religious views which contain no idea of public responsibility, or which consider religious opinion irrelevant to politics, are not impinged upon by this type of secularization of public discourse.\n\nFormer President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] criticised \"negative la\u00efcit\u00e9\" and talked about a \"positive la\u00efcit\u00e9\" that recognizes the contribution of faith to French culture, history and society, allows for faith in the public discourse and for government subsidies for faith-based groups.<ref name=\"christiantoday.com\">Beita, Peter B.

Catholic priests as well as the clergy of three other religions (the Lutheran [[EPCAAL]], the Calvinist [[EPRAL]], and Jewish [[Consistory (Judaism)|consistories]]) are paid by the state, and schools have religion courses. Moreover, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Metz|Catholic bishops of Metz]] and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Strasbourg|of Strasbourg]] are named (or rather, formally appointed) by the French Head of State on proposition of the Pope. In the same way, the presidents of the two official Protestant churches are appointed by the State, after proposition by their respective Churches. This makes the French President the only temporal power in the world to formally have retained the right to appoint Catholic bishops, all other Catholic bishops being appointed by the Pope.\n* In French Guyana the Royal Regulation of 1828 makes the French state pay for the Roman Catholic clergy, but not for the clergy of other religions.\n* In the French oversea departments and territories since the 1939 d\u00e9cret Mandel the French State supports the Churches.  \n* The French President is ''ex officio'' a [[co-prince of Andorra]], where Roman Catholicism has a status of state religion (the other co-prince being the [[Bishop of Urgell|Roman Catholic Bishop of Seu de Urgell]], Spain). Moreover, French heads of states are traditionally offered an honorary title of [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] of the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran|Papal Archbasilica of St. John Lateran]], Cathedral of Rome. Once this honour has been awarded to a newly elected president, France pays for a ''choir vicar'', a priest who occupies the seat in the canonical chapter of the Cathedral in lieu of the president (all French presidents have been male and at least formally Roman Catholic, but if one were not, this honour could most probably not be awarded to him or her.)  The French President also holds a seat in a few other canonical chapters in France.\n* Another example of the complex ties between France and the Catholic Church consists in the ''Pieux \u00c9tablissements de la France \u00e0 Rome et \u00e0 Lorette'': five churches in Rome ([[Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti]], St. Louis of the French, St. Ivo of the Bretons, St. Claude of the Free County of Burgundy, and St. Nicholas of the Lorrains) as well as a chapel in [[Loreto, Marche|Loreto]] belong to France, and are administered and paid for by a special foundation linked to the French embassy to the Holy See.\n* In [[Wallis and Futuna]], a French overseas territory, national education is conceded to the diocese, which gets paid for it by the State\n* A further entanglement consists in liturgical honours accorded to French consular officials under Capitations with the Ottoman Empire which persist for example in the Lebanon and in ownership of the Catholic cathedral in Smyrna (Izmir) and the extraterritoriality of St. Anne's in Jerusalem and more generally the diplomatic status of the Holy Places.\n\n===Germany===\n{{see also|Religion in Germany}}\n[[File:S95CrucifixCourtroomNuremberg.jpg|thumb|left|Courtroom with Crucifix in Nuremberg, Germany, June 2016]]\nThe [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German constitution]] guarantees [[freedom of religion]],<ref name=\"Section 4 of German Basic Law\">Section 4 of German Basic Law</ref> but there is not a complete separation of church and state in Germany.

The law was unpopular; and several protesters from rural areas, fought against federal troops in what became known as the [[Cristero War]].

A degree of freedom of worship (for foreign residents only) was achieved under the rule of [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] (1771\u201392), but it was not until the passage of the Dissenter Acts of 1860 and 1874 that Swedish citizens were allowed to leave the state church \u2013 and then only provided that those wishing to do so first registered their adhesion to another, officially approved denomination. Following years of discussions that began in 1995, the Church of Sweden was finally separated from the state as from 1 January 2000. However, the separation was not fully completed. Although the status of state religion came to an end, the Church of Sweden nevertheless remains Swedens national church, and as such is still regulated by the government through the law of the Church of Sweden. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to refer to a change of relation between state and church rather than a separation. Furthermore, the Swedish constitution still maintain that the Sovereign and the members of the royal family has to confess an evangelical Lutheran faith, which in practice means they need to be members of the Church of Sweden to remain in the line of succession. Thusly according to the ideas of [[cuius regio, eius religio]] one could argue that the symbolic connection between state and church still remains.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/januaryweb-only/11.0.html|title=Swedish Church State Separate|magazine=Christianity Today|first=Ted|last=Olsen|date=1 January 2000|accessdate=27 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Switzerland ===\n{{Main|Religion in Switzerland}}\nThe articles 8 (\"Equality before the law\") and 15 (\"Freedom of religion and conscience\") of the [[Federal Constitution of the Swiss Confederation]] guarantees individual freedom of beliefs.<ref name=CstCH>[https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19995395/index.html Federal Constitution of the Swiss Confederation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621000507/https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19995395/index.html |date=June 21, 2016 }}, status as of 14 June 2015, [[Federal Chancellery of Switzerland]] (page visited on 17 December 2015).</ref> It notably states that \" No person may be forced to join or belong to a religious community, to participate in a religious act or to follow religious teachings\".<ref name=CstCH/>\n\nChurches and state are separated at the federal level since 1848.

The Lords Spiritual have a significant influence when they vote as a bloc on certain issues, notably moral issues like abortion and [[euthanasia]]. All of state-funded schools in England are religious school, too, and most are controlled by the Church of England, with significant numbers of state-funded Catholic, Muslim, and Jewish schools as well. The Anglican Church also has specific legal rights and responsibilities in solemnised marriages that are different from other faith organisations. Non-religious couples can have a [[civil wedding]] with no religious elements, but non-religious [[humanist celebrant|humanist weddings]] are not yet legally recognised in their own right.

However, though the Kirk is disestablished, Scotland is not a secular polity. The Kirk remains a [[national church]] to which the state has special obligations; it is conventional that the monarch, who is head of state, must attend the Church when she visits Scotland, and they swear in their accession oath to maintain and preserve the church. The state also gives numerous preferences to the Church of Scotland and Catholic Church, particularly in education. The [[blasphemy law]] has not been abolished in Scotland, though it has fallen into disuse.

In that letter, referencing the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], Jefferson writes:\n\n{{quote|Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, & not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\", thus building a wall of separation between Church & State.<ref name=Jefferson11 />}}\n\nAnother early user of the term was [[James Madison]], the principal drafter of the [[United States Bill of Rights]].  In a 1789 debate in the House of Representatives regarding the draft of the First Amendment, the following was said:\n\n{{quote|August 15, 1789. Mr. [Peter] Sylvester [of New York] had some doubts. \u2026 He feared it [the First Amendment] might be thought to have a tendency to abolish religion altogether. \u2026 Mr. [Elbridge] Gerry [of Massachusetts] said it would read better if it was that \"no religious doctrine shall be established by law.\" \u2026 Mr. [James] Madison [of Virginia] said he apprehended the meaning of the words to be, that \"Congress should not establish a religion, and enforce the legal observation of it by law.\" \u2026 [T]he State[s] \u2026 seemed to entertain an opinion that under the clause of the Constitution. \u2026 it enabled them [Congress] to make laws of such a nature as might \u2026 establish a national religion; to prevent these effects he presumed the amendment was intended. \u2026 Mr. Madison thought if the word \"National\" was inserted before religion, it would satisfy the minds of honorable gentlemen. \u2026 He thought if the word \"national\" was introduced, it would point the amendment directly to the object it was intended to prevent.<ref>''Debates and Proceedings in the Congress of the United States'' (Washington, D.C.: Gales & Seaton, 1834, Vol. I pp. 757\u201359, August 15, 1789</ref>}}\n\nMadison contended \"Because if Religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendI_religions43.html |title=James Madison, Memorial and Remonstrance against Religious Assessments |publisher=Press-pubs.uchicago.edu |accessdate=2012-04-27}}</ref> Several years later he wrote of \"total separation of the church from the state\".<ref>(March 2, 1819 letter to [[Robert Walsh (diplomat)|Robert Walsh]]), {{cite book|last=Lambert|first=Frank|title=The founding fathers and the place of religion in America|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2003|page=[https://archive.org/details/foundin_lam_2003_00_2547/page/288 288]|isbn=978-0-691-08829-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1qse4fZ6eQgC|ref=harv}}</ref> \"Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion & Govt in the Constitution of the United States\", Madison wrote,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/jm/18191213_monopolies.htm|title=Monopolies Perpetuities Corporations \u2013 Ecclesiastical Endowments|first=James|last=Madison|publisher=constitution.org|accessdate=2008-06-16|ref=harv}}</ref> and he declared, \"practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government is essential to the purity of both, and as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States.\"<ref>(1811 letter to Baptist Churches)</ref> In a letter to [[Edward Livingston]] Madison further expanded,\n\n<blockquote>We are teaching the world the great truth that Govts. do better without Kings & Nobles than with them.

F. Maclear, ''Church and state in the modern age: a documentary history'' (1995) p. 65</ref>}}\n\nUnder the [[United States Constitution]], the treatment of religion by the government is broken into two clauses: the [[establishment clause]] and the [[free exercise clause]].  Both are discussed in regard to whether certain state actions would amount to an impermissible government establishment of religion.\n\nThe phrase was also mentioned in an eloquent letter written by President [[John Tyler]] on July 10, 1843.<ref>Tyler wrote, \"The United States have adventured upon a great and noble experiment, which is believed to have been hazarded in the absence of all previous precedent \u2013 that of total separation of Church and State. No religious establishment by law exists among us. The conscience is left free from all restraint and each is permitted to worship his Maker after his own judgment. The offices of the Government are open alike to all. No tithes are levied to support an established Hierarchy, nor is the fallible judgment of man set up as the sure and infallible creed of faith. The Mahommedan, if he will to come among us would have the privilege guaranteed to him by the constitution to worship according to the Koran; and the East Indian might erect a shrine to Brahma if it so pleased him. Such is the spirit of toleration inculcated by our political Institutions . \u2026 The Hebrew persecuted and down trodden in other regions takes up his abode among us with none to make him afraid . \u2026 and the Aegis of the Government is over him to defend and protect him. Such is the great experiment which we have cried, and such are the happy fruits which have resulted from it; our system of free government would be imperfect without it.\") quoted in Nicole Gu\u00e9tin, ''Religious ideology in American politics: a history'' (2009) p. 85</ref> During the 1960 presidential campaign the potential influence of the Catholic Church on John F. Kennedy's presidency was raised. If elected, it would be the first time that a Catholic would occupy the highest office in the United States. [[John F. Kennedy]], in his [[s:Address of Senator John F. Kennedy to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association|Address to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association]] on 12 September 1960, addressed the question directly, saying,\n\n{{quote|I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute \u2013 where no Catholic prelate would tell the President (should he be Catholic) how to act, and no Protestant minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote \u2013 where no church or church school is granted any public funds or political preference \u2013 and where no man is denied public office merely because his religion differs from the President who might appoint him or the people who might elect him. I believe in an America that is officially neither Catholic, Protestant nor Jewish \u2013 where no public official either requests or accepts instructions on public policy from the Pope, the National Council of Churches or any other ecclesiastical source \u2013 where no religious body seeks to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of its officials \u2013 and where religious liberty is so indivisible that an act against one church is treated as an act against all.

While the pledge was created by [[Francis Bellamy]] in 1891, in 1954, the [[Knights of Columbus]], a Catholic organization, campaigned with other groups to have the words \"under God\" added to the pledge. On June 14, 1954, President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] signed the bill to make the addition.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-man-who-wrote-the-pledge-of-allegiance-93907224/|title=The Man Who Wrote the Pledge of Allegiance|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en}}</ref>\n\nSince then, critics have challenged the existence of the phrase in the Pledge. In 2004, [[Michael Newdow]], an ordained [[atheist]] minister of the [[Universal Life Church]] challenged a Californian law which required students to recite the pledge. He said the law violated his daughter's right to free speech. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the school system in ''[[Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow]]'', mainly due to the fact that the father could not claim sufficient custody of the child over his ex-wife who was the legal guardian and had opposed the lawsuit. Additionally, the Supreme Court stated that teachers leading students in the pledge was constitutional, and therefore the pledge should stay the same.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-latest-controversy-about-under-god-in-the-pledge-of-allegiance|title=The history of legal challenges to the Pledge of Allegiance \u2013 National Constitution Center|website=[[National Constitution Center]] \u2013 constitutioncenter.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}</ref>\n\n== Religious views ==\n\n===Islam: Ahmadiyya===\n[[File:Liwa-e-Ahmadiyya and Minarat-ul-Massih.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|The [[White Minaret (Qadian)|White Minaret]] and the Ahmadiyya Flag in [[Qadian]], [[India]].]]\nAccording to the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]]'s understanding of [[Islam]], Islamic principles state that the politics of government should be separate from the doctrine of religion.

Monsignor John A. Ryan speaks of this Catholic doctrine thusly: \"If there is only one true religion, and if its possession is the most important good in life, for states as well as individuals, then the public profession, protection, and promotion of this religion, and the legal prohibition of all direct assaults upon it, becomes one of the most obvious and fundamental duties of the state.

He served with the British forces in the War of 1812 as an assistant quartermaster-general, and in 1832 purchased some 14,000 acres of land in Nichol Township. He selected this area at the falls of the Grand River as a town site for his proposed settlement and named it Elora. It was laid out by Lewis Burwell, deputy provincial land surveyor, late in 1832, and the following year Gilkison established a sawmill and a general store. The founder of Elora died in April, 1833, before the full results of his foresight and enterprise were achieved.\n[[File:Reservists marshalled, in Elora Ontario, in 1862.jpg|thumb|Voluntary regiment in May 1862 in Elora, Ontario.

He had also served in the War of 1812. He bought 14,000 acres of land on the Grand River and settled on the east side of the river.

Over the years, approximately 1500 \"deserving\" poor, including those who were destitute, old and infirm or suffering from disabilities were housed here. The sixty bed house for \"inmates\" was surrounded by a 30-acre \"industrial\" farm with a barn for livestock that produced some of the food for the 70 residents and the staff and also provided work for them. Others worked in the House itself. According to a 2009 report by the [[Toronto Star]], \"pauperism was considered a moral failing that could be erased through order and hard work\". A hospital was added in 1892. A nearby cemetery has 271 plots for those who died. In 1947 the House was converted into the Wellington County Home for the Aged and in 1975 the building reopened as the Wellington County Museum and Archives.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/2009/01/03/when_poorhouse_wasnt_only_an_expression.html |title=When 'poorhouse' wasn't only an expression |publisher=The Toronto Star|date=January 3, 2009 |first=Tracey |last=Tyler |accessdate=November 30, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wellington.ca/en/discover/resources/handout_barn_2014_trifold.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Bank Barn and the Industrial Farm |publisher=Wellington County Museum and Archives |accessdate=November 30, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thespec.com/community-story/6754115-meet-the-ghosts-of-wellington-county-s-poor-house-in-elora/ |title=Meet the ghosts of Wellington County's Poor House in Elora |date=July 5, 2016 |work=The [[Hamilton Spectator]] |publisher=Metroland Media Group Ltd |accessdate=November 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nA historic plaque was erected at the museum, indicating that the \"government-supported poorhouse\" was \"the shelter of last resort for the homeless and destitute, who traded spartan accommodations for domestic or agricultural labour\".<ref name=\"WCHIR\">{{cite web |title=The Wellington County House of Industry and Refuge |url=http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_Wellington36.html |website=OntarioPlaques.com |publisher=Alan L.

The plan became the subject of much debate. The [[Centre Wellington Citizens Coalition]] was formed in opposition to the race track, primarily because of the inclusion of gambling facilities. A 4\u20133 decision to approve the opening was made by township council. It came down to a 3\u20133 decision and the mayor at the time voted in favour of it. The Grand River Raceway eventually opened in Elora in 2002, with Slots At Grand River Raceway offering 200 [[slot machine]]s operated by the [[Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation]] (OLG).\n\nGrand River Raceway is owned and operated by the Grand River Agricultural Society (G.R.A.S.), a not-for-profit corporation, incorporated under the Agricultural Societies Act of Ontario and operated by a volunteer board of directors. The Society operates the racetrack and other facilities. It leases space to the OLG for the slot machines; the OLG is the operator and employer for the slots operation.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Grand River Raceway |url=http://grandriverraceway.com/about/ |title=About Us |accessdate=December 30, 2017}}</ref> In 2009, the business paid $1.6 million in taxes and the OLG paid the Township an additional $1.78 million, being a share of the profits.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Racinos in Rural Canada: Economic Impacts of the Grand River Raceway on Elora, Ontario, Canada |url=http://journals.brandonu.ca/jrcd/article/view/536 |first1=Meghan |last1=Shannon |first2=Clare J.

He served with the British forces in the War of 1812 as an assistant quartermaster-general, and in 1832 purchased some 14,000 acres of land in Nichol Township. He selected this area at the falls of the Grand River as a town site for his proposed settlement and named it Elora. It was laid out by Lewis Burwell, deputy provincial land surveyor, late in 1832, and the following year Gilkison established a sawmill and a general store. The founder of Elora died in April, 1833, before the full results of his foresight and enterprise were achieved.\n[[File:Reservists marshalled, in Elora Ontario, in 1862.jpg|thumb|Voluntary regiment in May 1862 in Elora, Ontario.

Over the years, approximately 1500 \"deserving\" poor, including those who were destitute, old and infirm or suffering from disabilities were housed here. The sixty bed house for \"inmates\" was surrounded by a 30-acre \"industrial\" farm with a barn for livestock that produced some of the food for the 70 residents and the staff and also provided work for them. Others worked in the House itself. According to a 2009 report by the [[Toronto Star]], \"pauperism was considered a moral failing that could be erased through order and hard work\". A hospital was added in 1892. A nearby cemetery has 271 plots for those who died. In 1947 the House was converted into the Wellington County Home for the Aged and in 1975 the building reopened as the Wellington County Museum and Archives.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/2009/01/03/when_poorhouse_wasnt_only_an_expression.html |title=When 'poorhouse' wasn't only an expression |publisher=The Toronto Star|date=January 3, 2009 |first=Tracey |last=Tyler |accessdate=November 30, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wellington.ca/en/discover/resources/handout_barn_2014_trifold.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Bank Barn and the Industrial Farm |publisher=Wellington County Museum and Archives |accessdate=November 30, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thespec.com/community-story/6754115-meet-the-ghosts-of-wellington-county-s-poor-house-in-elora/ |title=Meet the ghosts of Wellington County's Poor House in Elora |date=July 5, 2016 |work=The [[Hamilton Spectator]] |publisher=Metroland Media Group Ltd |accessdate=November 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nA historic plaque was erected at the museum, indicating that the \"government-supported poorhouse\" was \"the shelter of last resort for the homeless and destitute, who traded spartan accommodations for domestic or agricultural labour\".<ref name=\"WCHIR\">{{cite web |title=The Wellington County House of Industry and Refuge |url=http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_Wellington36.html |website=OntarioPlaques.com |publisher=Alan L.

The plan became the subject of much debate. The [[Centre Wellington Citizens Coalition]] was formed in opposition to the race track, primarily because of the inclusion of gambling facilities. A 4\u20133 decision to approve the opening was made by township council. It came down to a 3\u20133 decision and the mayor at the time voted in favour of it. The Grand River Raceway eventually opened in Elora in 2002, with Slots At Grand River Raceway offering 200 [[slot machine]]s operated by the [[Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation]] (OLG).\n\nGrand River Raceway is owned and operated by the Grand River Agricultural Society (G.R.A.S.), a not-for-profit corporation, incorporated under the Agricultural Societies Act of Ontario and operated by a volunteer board of directors. The Society operates the racetrack and other facilities. It leases space to the OLG for the slot machines; the OLG is the operator and employer for the slots operation.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Grand River Raceway |url=http://grandriverraceway.com/about/ |title=About Us |accessdate=December 30, 2017}}</ref> In 2009, the business paid $1.6 million in taxes and the OLG paid the Township an additional $1.78 million, being a share of the profits.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Racinos in Rural Canada: Economic Impacts of the Grand River Raceway on Elora, Ontario, Canada |url=http://journals.brandonu.ca/jrcd/article/view/536 |first1=Meghan |last1=Shannon |first2=Clare J.

She generally selects sheltered places such as dark, hollow tree trunks. She first builds a series of cells (up to 50) out of chewed tree bark. The cells are arranged in horizontal layers named combs, each cell being vertical and closed at the top. An egg is then laid in each cell. After 5\u20138 days, the egg hatches, and in the next two weeks, the larva undergoes its five stages. During this time, the queen feeds it a protein-rich diet of insects. Then, the larva spins a silk cap over the cell's opening and, during the next two weeks, transforms into an adult, a process called [[Metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]]. The adult then eats its way through the silk cap. This first generation of workers, invariably females, now gradually undertakes all the tasks formerly carried out by the queen ([[foraging]], nest building, taking care of the [[brood (honeybee)|brood]], etc.) with the exception of [[Oviposition|egg-laying]], which remains exclusive to the queen.\n\n[[File:HornetLifeLyd.png|thumb|right|250px|Life history of ''[[Vespa crabro]]'']]\n\nAs the [[Group size measures|colony size]] grows, new combs are added, and an envelope is built around the cell layers until the nest is entirely covered, with the exception of an entry hole. To be able to build cells in total darkness, they apparently use gravity to aid them. At the peak of its population, which occurs in late summer, the colony can reach a size of 700 workers.\n\nAt this time, the queen starts producing the first reproductive individuals. Fertilized eggs develop into females (called \"[[gynes]]\" by entomologists), and unfertilized ones develop into males (sometimes called \"drones\"). Adult males do not participate in nest maintenance, foraging, or caretaking of the larvae. In early to mid autumn, they leave the nest and mate during \"[[nuptial flight]]s.\"\n\nOther temperate species (e.g., the [[Vespa simillima|yellow hornet]], ''V. simillima'', or the [[Oriental hornet]], ''V. orientalis'') have similar cycles. In the case of tropical species (e.g., ''V. tropica''), life histories may well differ, and in species with both tropical and temperate distributions (such as the [[Asian giant hornet]], ''Vespa mandarinia''), the cycle likely depends on latitude.\n\n==Distribution==\nHornets are found mainly in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. The common [[European hornet]] (''Vespa crabro'') is the best-known species, widely distributed in [[Europe]] (but is never found north of the [[63rd parallel north|63rd parallel]]), [[Ukraine]] and [[European Russia]] (except in extreme northern areas). In the east, the species' distribution area stretches over the [[Ural Mountains]] to [[West Siberian Plain|Western Siberia]] (found in the vicinity of [[Khanty-Mansiysk]]). In [[Asia]], the common European hornet is found in southern Siberia, as well as in [[East China|eastern China]]. The common European hornet was accidentally introduced to eastern North America about the middle of the 19th century and has lived there since at about the same latitudes as in Europe. However, it has never been found in western North America.\n\nThe [[Asian giant hornet]] (''Vespa mandarinia'') lives in the [[Primorsky Krai]], [[Khabarovsky Krai]] (southern part) and [[Jewish AO]] regions of Russia, China, Korea, [[Taiwan]], [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], Vietnam, [[Indochina]], [[India]], [[Nepal]], Sri Lanka and [[Thailand]], but is most commonly found in the mountains of Japan, where they are commonly known as the giant sparrow bee.\n\nThe [[Oriental hornet]] (''Vespa orientalis'') occurs in semi-dry sub-tropical areas of [[Central Asia]] ([[Armenia]], [[Dagestan]] in Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, [[Oman]], Pakistan, [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Kyrghyzstan]], southern [[Kazakhstan]]), [[southern Europe]] (Italy, [[Malta]], [[Albania]], Romania, Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, [[Cyprus]]), [[North Africa]] ([[Algeria]], Libya, Egypt, Sudan, [[Eritrea]], Somalia) and along the shores of the [[Gulf of Aden]] and in the [[Middle East]].

Allergic reactions are commonly treated with [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline) injection using a device such as an [[epinephrine autoinjector]], with prompt follow-up treatment in a hospital. In severe cases, allergic individuals may go into [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic shock]] and die unless treated promptly.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000033.htm|title=Insect bites and stings: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia}}</ref>\n\n==Attack pheromone==\nHornets, like many social wasps, can mobilize the entire nest to sting in defense, which is highly dangerous to humans and other animals. The attack [[pheromone]] is released in case of threat to the nest. In the case of the [[Asian giant hornet]] (''[[Asian giant hornet|Vespa mandarinia]]'') this is also used to mobilize many workers at once when attacking colonies of their prey, [[honey bee]]s and other ''Vespa'' species.<ref name=chemicals>{{cite web|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/critter/8137hornets.html|title=Volatile fragrance chemicals may attract unwanted attention from hornets and bees}}</ref> Three biologically active chemicals, 2-[[pentanol]], [[3-methyl-1-butanol]], and 1-methylbutyl 3-methylbutanoate, have been identified for this species. In field tests, 2-pentanol alone triggered mild alarm and defensive behavior, but adding the other two compounds increased aggressiveness in a [[Synergy|synergistic]] effect.<ref name=chemicals/> In the [[European hornet]] (''[[Vespa crabro]]'') the major compound of the alarm pheromone is 2-methyl-3-butene-2-ol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pherobase.com/database/genus/genus-Vespa.php|title=Vespa|work=pherobase.com}}</ref>\n\nIf a hornet is killed near a nest it may release pheromones that can cause the other hornets to attack. Materials that come in contact with these pheromones, such as clothes, skin, and dead prey or hornets, can also trigger an attack, as can certain food flavorings, such as banana and apple flavorings, and fragrances that contain [[Alcohol#Common names|C<sub>5</sub> alcohols]] and C<sub>10</sub> [[esters]].<ref name=chemicals/>\n\n==Diet and feeding==\nAdult hornets and their relatives (e.g., [[yellowjacket]]s) feed themselves with nectar and sugar-rich plant foods. Thus, they can often be found feeding on the sap of [[oak trees]], rotting sweet fruits, honey and any sugar-containing foodstuffs. Hornets frequently fly into orchards to feed on overripe fruit. Hornets tend to gnaw a hole into fruit to become totally immersed into its pulp. A person who accidentally plucks a fruit with a feeding hornet can be attacked by the disturbed insect. Hornets also produce [[jam]], similar to how [[bee]]s produce [[honey]] inside their hives; the flavour of the jam is dependant on the hornets diet.\n\nThe adults also attack various insects, which they kill with stings and jaws. Due to their size and the power of their venom, hornets are able to kill large insects such as [[honey bee]]s, [[grasshopper]]s, [[locust]]s and [[katydid]]s without difficulty. The victim is fully masticated and then fed to the [[larvae]] developing in the nest, rather than consumed by the adult hornets. Given that some of their prey are considered pests, hornets may be considered beneficial under some circumstances.\n\nThe larvae of hornets produce a sweet secretion containing sugars and amino acids that is consumed by the workers and queens.<ref>Wheeler, W.M.

Yellowjackets are generally smaller than hornets and are bright yellow and black, whereas hornets may often be black and white. There is also a related genus of Asian nocturnal vespines, ''[[Provespa]]'', which are referred to as \"night wasps\" or \"night hornets\",<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.vespa-bicolor.net/main/vespid/provespa.htm |title=Untitled Document}}</ref> though they are not true hornets.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Madl |first1=M |title=Notes on the genus ''Provespa'' Ashmead, 1903 (Insecta: Hymenoptera: Vespidae: Vespinae) based on the material of the Naturhistorisches Museum Wien (Austria)|journal=Annals Naturhistorisches Museum Wien|date=2012|volume=114|pages=27\u201335|url= http://www.zobodat.at/pdf/ANNA_114B_0027-0035.pdf |accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nSome other large wasps are sometimes referred to as hornets, most notably the [[bald-faced hornet]] (''Dolichovespula maculata'') found in North America. It is set apart by its black and ivory coloration. The name \"hornet\" is used for this and related species primarily because of their habit of making aerial nests (similar to the true hornets) rather than subterranean nests. Another example is the [[Australian hornet]] (''Abispa ephippium''), which is actually a species of [[potter wasp]].\n\n==Species (22 extant + 7 \u2020fossil; not including subspecies)==\n{{div col|colwidth=14em}}\n* ''[[Vespa affinis]]''\n* ''[[Vespa analis]]''\n* ''[[Vespa basalis]]''\n* ''[[Vespa bellicosa]]''\n* ''[[Vespa bicolor]]''\n* \u2020''[[Vespa bilineata]]''\n* ''[[Vespa binghami]]''\n* \u2020''[[Vespa ciliata]]''\n* \u2020''[[Vespa cordifera]]''\n* ''[[Vespa crabro]]''\n* \u2020''[[Vespa crabroniformis]]''\n* \u2020''[[Vespa dasypodia]]''\n* ''[[Vespa ducalis]]''\n* ''[[Vespa dybowskii]]''\n* ''[[Vespa fervida]]''\n* ''[[Vespa fumida]]''\n* ''[[Vespa luctuosa]]''\n* ''[[Vespa mandarinia]]''\n* ''[[Vespa mocsaryana]]''\n* ''[[Vespa multimaculata]]''\n* \u2020''[[Vespa nigra]]''\n* ''[[Vespa orientalis]]''\n* ''[[Vespa philippinensis]]''\n* \u2020''[[Vespa picea]]''\n* ''[[Vespa simillima]]''\n* ''[[Vespa soror]]''\n* ''[[Vespa tropica]]''\n* ''[[Vespa velutina]]''\n* ''[[Vespa vivax]]''\n{{div col end}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Notable species===\n* [[Asian giant hornet]] ''Vespa mandarinia''\n**''[[Vespa mandarinia japonica]]'' (sometimes known as ''Japanese giant hornet'') \u2013 the largest wasp, and the most venomous known insect (per sting).<ref name=\"toxicon\"/>\n* [[Asian predatory wasp]] ''Vespa velutina''\n* [[Black-bellied hornet]] ''Vespa basalis''\n* [[Vespa bicolor|Black shield wasp]] ''Vespa bicolor''\n* [[European hornet]] ''Vespa crabro'', (sometimes known as ''Old World Hornet'', or ''Brown Hornet'').\n* [[Greater banded hornet]] ''Vespa tropica''\n* [[Japanese hornet]] ''Vespa simillima'' (sometimes known as ''Japanese yellow hornet'').\n* [[Lesser banded hornet]] ''Vespa affinis''\n* [[Oriental hornet]] ''Vespa orientalis''\n* ''[[Vespa luctuosa]]'' the most lethal wasp venom (per volume).<ref name=\"toxicon\"/>\n* Black hornet ''Vespa dybowskii''\n\n== As food and medicine ==\nHornet larvae are widely accepted as food in mountainous regions in China. \nHornets and their nest are treated as medicine in Traditional Chinese Medicine.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Vespa basalis .jpg|Black-bellied hornet (''[[Vespa basalis]]''), Xingping\nFile:Asian predatory wasp (Vespa velutina var. nigrithorax).jpg|Asian predatory wasp ([[Vespa velutina|''Vespa velutina'' var.

Allergic reactions are commonly treated with [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline) injection using a device such as an [[epinephrine autoinjector]], with prompt follow-up treatment in a hospital. In severe cases, allergic individuals may go into [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic shock]] and die unless treated promptly.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000033.htm|title=Insect bites and stings: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia}}</ref>\n\n==Attack pheromone==\nHornets, like many social wasps, can mobilize the entire nest to sting in defense, which is highly dangerous to humans and other animals. The attack [[pheromone]] is released in case of threat to the nest. In the case of the [[Asian giant hornet]] (''[[Asian giant hornet|Vespa mandarinia]]'') this is also used to mobilize many workers at once when attacking colonies of their prey, [[honey bee]]s and other ''Vespa'' species.<ref name=chemicals>{{cite web|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/critter/8137hornets.html|title=Volatile fragrance chemicals may attract unwanted attention from hornets and bees}}</ref> Three biologically active chemicals, 2-[[pentanol]], [[3-methyl-1-butanol]], and 1-methylbutyl 3-methylbutanoate, have been identified for this species. In field tests, 2-pentanol alone triggered mild alarm and defensive behavior, but adding the other two compounds increased aggressiveness in a [[Synergy|synergistic]] effect.<ref name=chemicals/> In the [[European hornet]] (''[[Vespa crabro]]'') the major compound of the alarm pheromone is 2-methyl-3-butene-2-ol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pherobase.com/database/genus/genus-Vespa.php|title=Vespa|work=pherobase.com}}</ref>\n\nIf a hornet is killed near a nest it may release pheromones that can cause the other hornets to attack. Materials that come in contact with these pheromones, such as clothes, skin, and dead prey or hornets, can also trigger an attack, as can certain food flavorings, such as banana and apple flavorings, and fragrances that contain [[Alcohol#Common names|C<sub>5</sub> alcohols]] and C<sub>10</sub> [[esters]].<ref name=chemicals/>\n\n==Diet and feeding==\nAdult hornets and their relatives (e.g., [[yellowjacket]]s) feed themselves with nectar and sugar-rich plant foods. Thus, they can often be found feeding on the sap of [[oak trees]], rotting sweet fruits, honey and any sugar-containing foodstuffs. Hornets frequently fly into orchards to feed on overripe fruit. Hornets tend to gnaw a hole into fruit to become totally immersed into its pulp. A person who accidentally plucks a fruit with a feeding hornet can be attacked by the disturbed insect.\n\nThe adults also attack various insects, which they kill with stings and jaws. Due to their size and the power of their venom, hornets are able to kill large insects such as [[honey bee]]s, [[grasshopper]]s, [[locust]]s and [[katydid]]s without difficulty. The victim is fully masticated and then fed to the [[larvae]] developing in the nest, rather than consumed by the adult hornets. Given that some of their prey are considered pests, hornets may be considered beneficial under some circumstances.\n\nThe larvae of hornets produce a sweet secretion containing sugars and amino acids that is consumed by the workers and queens.<ref>Wheeler, W.M. (1922) Social Life Among the Insects. II. The Scientific Monthly 15(1): 68\u201388</ref>\n\n==Hornets and other Vespidae==\n[[File:Vespa crabro germana with prey Richard Bartz Crop.jpg|thumb|right|[[European hornet]] with the remnants of a [[Western honey bee|honey bee]].]]\n\n{{main|Characteristics of common wasps and bees}}\n\nWhile taxonomically well defined, there may be some confusion about the differences between hornets and other wasps of the family [[Vespidae]], specifically the [[yellowjacket]]s, which are members of the same subfamily. Yellowjackets are generally smaller than hornets and are bright yellow and black, whereas hornets may often be black and white. There is also a related genus of Asian nocturnal vespines, ''[[Provespa]]'', which are referred to as \"night wasps\" or \"night hornets\",<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.vespa-bicolor.net/main/vespid/provespa.htm |title=Untitled Document}}</ref> though they are not true hornets.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Madl |first1=M |title=Notes on the genus ''Provespa'' Ashmead, 1903 (Insecta: Hymenoptera: Vespidae: Vespinae) based on the material of the Naturhistorisches Museum Wien (Austria)|journal=Annals Naturhistorisches Museum Wien|date=2012|volume=114|pages=27\u201335|url= http://www.zobodat.at/pdf/ANNA_114B_0027-0035.pdf |accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nSome other large wasps are sometimes referred to as hornets, most notably the [[bald-faced hornet]] (''Dolichovespula maculata'') found in North America. It is set apart by its black and ivory coloration. The name \"hornet\" is used for this and related species primarily because of their habit of making aerial nests (similar to the true hornets) rather than subterranean nests. Another example is the [[Australian hornet]] (''Abispa ephippium''), which is actually a species of [[potter wasp]].\n\n==Species (22 extant + 7 \u2020fossil; not including subspecies)==\n{{div col|colwidth=14em}}\n* ''[[Vespa affinis]]''\n* ''[[Vespa analis]]''\n* ''[[Vespa basalis]]''\n* ''[[Vespa bellicosa]]''\n* ''[[Vespa bicolor]]''\n* \u2020''[[Vespa bilineata]]''\n* ''[[Vespa binghami]]''\n* \u2020''[[Vespa ciliata]]''\n* \u2020''[[Vespa cordifera]]''\n* ''[[Vespa crabro]]''\n* \u2020''[[Vespa crabroniformis]]''\n* \u2020''[[Vespa dasypodia]]''\n* ''[[Vespa ducalis]]''\n* ''[[Vespa dybowskii]]''\n* ''[[Vespa fervida]]''\n* ''[[Vespa fumida]]''\n* ''[[Vespa luctuosa]]''\n* ''[[Vespa mandarinia]]''\n* ''[[Vespa mocsaryana]]''\n* ''[[Vespa multimaculata]]''\n* \u2020''[[Vespa nigra]]''\n* ''[[Vespa orientalis]]''\n* ''[[Vespa philippinensis]]''\n* \u2020''[[Vespa picea]]''\n* ''[[Vespa simillima]]''\n* ''[[Vespa soror]]''\n* ''[[Vespa tropica]]''\n* ''[[Vespa velutina]]''\n* ''[[Vespa vivax]]''\n{{div col end}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Notable species===\n* [[Asian giant hornet]] ''Vespa mandarinia''\n**''[[Vespa mandarinia japonica]]'' (sometimes known as ''Japanese giant hornet'') \u2013 the largest wasp, and the most venomous known insect (per sting).<ref name=\"toxicon\"/>\n* [[Asian predatory wasp]] ''Vespa velutina''\n* [[Black-bellied hornet]] ''Vespa basalis''\n* [[Vespa bicolor|Black shield wasp]] ''Vespa bicolor''\n* [[European hornet]] ''Vespa crabro'', (sometimes known as ''Old World Hornet'', or ''Brown Hornet'').\n* [[Greater banded hornet]] ''Vespa tropica''\n* [[Japanese hornet]] ''Vespa simillima'' (sometimes known as ''Japanese yellow hornet'').\n* [[Lesser banded hornet]] ''Vespa affinis''\n* [[Oriental hornet]] ''Vespa orientalis''\n* ''[[Vespa luctuosa]]'' the most lethal wasp venom (per volume).<ref name=\"toxicon\"/>\n* Black hornet ''Vespa dybowskii''\n\n== As food and medicine ==\nHornet larvae are widely accepted as food in mountainous regions in China. \nHornets and their nest are treated as medicine in Traditional Chinese Medicine.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Vespa basalis .jpg|Black-bellied hornet (''[[Vespa basalis]]''), Xingping\nFile:Asian predatory wasp (Vespa velutina var. nigrithorax).jpg|Asian predatory wasp ([[Vespa velutina|''Vespa velutina'' var.

The tournament was inspired by [[Premier League Darts]], which is organized by the professional darts organisation, [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]]. The idea to play this tournament was created during the world-wide pandemic of [[COVID-19|Covid-19]]. The meaning of the competition is, apart from the fight against the coronavirus, also an introduction of more Czech players to the general public. For players it is a great opportunity to practice and compete during this hard time and to gain much needed experience for future years of their careers.<ref>https://isport.blesk.cz/clanek/ostatni-dalsi-sporty-sipky/377640/sipky-i-v-dobe-koronaviru-startuje-ceska-obdoba-premier-league.html</ref>\n\n== Format ==\nThe format of the tournament is very similar to Premier League Darts, which is organised by the [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]]. The main difference is the absence of a draw, each match has a winner and a loser. Each match starts with a [[bullseye (target)|bulls-eye]] shootout, which decides who will start the match. The first player to throw on the bulls-eye is the one that is listed as the first in the schedule. Values of the shootout are: 50 - the red middle; 25 - the green middle; outside. If both players score the same value, the shootout continues in the reversed order until the decision.\n\n'''Phase 1:'''  In the first phase of the competition (9 rounds), ten players play each other. Phase 1 matches have a maximum of eleven legs, allowing for the winner being first to six. At the end of Phase 1, the two bottom players are eliminated from the competition.\n\n'''Phase 2:''' In the second phase of the competition (7 rounds), eight remaining players play again each other. Phase 2 matches have a maximum of thirteen legs, allowing for the winner being first to seven. At the end of Phase 2, the bottom four players in the league table are eliminated from the competition. The first four players in the league table qualify for the Play-off.\n\n'''Play-off:''' The top four players in the league table contest the two knockout semi-finals with 1st playing 4th and 2nd playing 3rd. The semi-finals are first to 10 legs (best of 19). The two winning semi-finalists meet in the final which is also best of 19.\n\n== Venues ==\nDue to the [[coronavirus outbreak]] and regulations from the government of the [[Czech Republic]], all players will play from their home. All players have a [[webcam]] prepared in their home environment, through which it is possible to watch every thrown dart. After each throw, players announce their score. Viewers see both [[dartboard]]s at the same time, along with the scoreboard which is powered by [[DartConnect]].\n\n{{Location map+ | Czechia\n| width=700\n| caption=Map of player's locations\n| float=left\n| places =\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Fulnek\n    | lat_deg = 49.71\n    | lon_deg = 17.90 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Zderaz\n    | position=bottom\n    | lat_deg = 49.82\n    | lon_deg = 16.10 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = \u00davaly\n    | lat_deg = 50.07\n    | lon_deg = 14.73 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Prague\n    | position=left\n    | lat_deg = 50.08\n    | lon_deg = 14.41 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9\n    | lat_deg = 50.21\n    | lon_deg = 15.83 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = \u00dasobrno\n    | lat_deg = 49.59\n    | lon_deg = 16.78 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Bouzov\n    | position=left\n    | lat_deg = 49.70\n    | lon_deg = 16.89 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Po\u0159\u00ed\u010d\u00ed u Litomy\u0161le\n    | position=top\n    | lat_deg = 49.80\n    | lon_deg = 16.19 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Uni\u010dov\n    | position=top\n    | lat_deg = 49.77\n    | lon_deg = 17.12 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = N\u00e1vs\u00ed\n    | lat_deg = 49.58\n    | lon_deg = 18.76 }}\n}}\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n== Prize money ==\nThe first edition of the tournament does not include any prize money for players. On the contrary, the tournament has a charity meaning.

The tournament was inspired by [[Premier League Darts]], which is organized by the professional darts organisation, [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]]. The idea to play this tournament was created during the world-wide pandemic of [[COVID-19|Covid-19]]. The meaning of the competition is, apart from the fight against the coronavirus, also an introduction of more Czech players to the general public. For players it is a great opportunity to practice and compete during this hard time and to gain much needed experience for future years of their careers.<ref>https://isport.blesk.cz/clanek/ostatni-dalsi-sporty-sipky/377640/sipky-i-v-dobe-koronaviru-startuje-ceska-obdoba-premier-league.html</ref>\n\n== Format ==\nThe format of the tournament is very similar to Premier League Darts, which is organised by the [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]]. The main difference is the absence of a draw, each match has a winner and a loser. Each match starts with a [[bullseye (target)|bulls-eye]] shootout, which decides who will start the match. The first player to throw on the bulls-eye is the one that is listed as the first in the schedule. Values of the shootout are: 50 - the red middle; 25 - the green middle; outside. If both players score the same value, the shootout continues in the reversed order until the decision.\n\n'''Phase 1:'''  In the first phase of the competition (9 rounds), ten players play each other. Phase 1 matches have a maximum of eleven legs, allowing for the winner being first to six. At the end of Phase 1, the two bottom players are eliminated from the competition.\n\n'''Phase 2:''' In the second phase of the competition (7 rounds), eight remaining players play again each other. Phase 2 matches have a maximum of thirteen legs, allowing for the winner being first to seven. At the end of Phase 2, the bottom four players in the league table are eliminated from the competition. The first four players in the league table qualify for the Play-off.\n\n'''Play-off:''' The top four players in the league table contest the two knockout semi-finals with 1st playing 4th and 2nd playing 3rd. The semi-finals are first to 10 legs (best of 19). The two winning semi-finalists meet in the final which is also best of 19.\n\n== Venues ==\nDue to the [[coronavirus outbreak]] and regulations from the government of the [[Czech Republic]], all players will play from their home. All players have a [[webcam]] prepared in their home environment, through which it is possible to watch every thrown dart. After each throw, players announce their score. Viewers see both [[dartboard]]s at the same time, along with the scoreboard which is powered by [[DartConnect]].\n\n{{Location map+ | Czechia\n| width=700\n| caption=Map of player's locations\n| float=left\n| places =\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Fulnek\n    | lat_deg = 49.71\n    | lon_deg = 17.90 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Zderaz\n    | position=bottom\n    | lat_deg = 49.82\n    | lon_deg = 16.10 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = \u00davaly\n    | lat_deg = 50.07\n    | lon_deg = 14.73 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Prague\n    | position=left\n    | lat_deg = 50.08\n    | lon_deg = 14.41 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9\n    | lat_deg = 50.21\n    | lon_deg = 15.83 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = \u00dasobrno\n    | lat_deg = 49.59\n    | lon_deg = 16.78 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Bouzov\n    | position=left\n    | lat_deg = 49.70\n    | lon_deg = 16.89 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Po\u0159\u00ed\u010d\u00ed u Litomy\u0161le\n    | position=top\n    | lat_deg = 49.80\n    | lon_deg = 16.19 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Uni\u010dov\n    | position=top\n    | lat_deg = 49.77\n    | lon_deg = 17.12 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = N\u00e1vs\u00ed\n    | lat_deg = 49.58\n    | lon_deg = 18.76 }}\n}}\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n== Prize money ==\nThe first edition of the tournament does not include any prize money for players. On the contrary, the tournament has a charity meaning. For every thrown \"180\", the official partner of 2020 Tipsport Premier League, the company [[Tipsport]], donates 500 [[CZK]] for purchase of medical equipment (face masks, ventilators etc.) for the fight against the [[coronavirus]].<ref>https://www.irozhlas.cz/sport/ostatni-sporty/sipky-virtualni-serie-ceska-premier-league-pres-internet_2004030830_wei</ref>\n\n== Players==\nFor the first edition of Tipsport Premier League, 10 players have been chosen in advance including the former [[PDC World Youth Championship]] runner-up and [[JDC]]{{disambiguation needed|date=April 2020}} World Darts Championship runner-up, [[Adam Gawlas]] and the former [[PDC World Cup of Darts]] national team member, [[Pavel Jirkal]]. Other players have experience from international tournaments and are the best players in Czech Republic. The current Czech number one, [[Karel Sedl\u00e1\u010dek]], though invited, could not compete due to the contract obligations to [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]].<ref>https://sport.tn.nova.cz/clanek/ceske-sipky-spousti-svou-premier-league-zacina-se-uz-pristi-tyden.html</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Player\n|-\n|[[File:Daniel Barbo\u0159\u00e1k.jpg|100px|alt=Daniel Barbo\u0159\u00e1k|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Daniel Barbo\u0159\u00e1k]]\n|-\n|[[File:Adam Gawlas.jpg|100px|alt=Adam Gawlas|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Adam Gawlas]]\n|-\n|[[File:Pavel Jirkal.jpg|100px|alt=Pavel Jirkal|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Pavel Jirkal]]\n|-\n|[[File:Ond\u0159ej Kysilka.jpg|100px|alt=Ond\u0159ej Kysilka|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Ond\u0159ej Kysilka]]\n|-\n|[[File:Alexander Ma\u0161ek.jpg|100px|alt=Alexander Ma\u0161ek|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Alexander Ma\u0161ek]]\n|-\n|[[File:Michal Ondo.jpg|100px|alt=Michal Ondo|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Michal Ondo]]\n|-\n|[[File:David P\u00edsek.jpg|100px|alt=David P\u00edsek|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[David P\u00edsek]]\n|-\n|[[File:David Ros\u00ed.jpg|100px|alt=David Ros\u00ed|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[David Ros\u00ed]]\n|-\n|[[File:V\u00edt\u011bzslav Sedl\u00e1k.jpg|100px|alt=V\u00edt\u011bzslav Sedl\u00e1k|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[V\u00edt\u011bzslav Sedl\u00e1k]]\n|-\n|[[File:Michal \u0160mejda.jpg|100px|alt=Michal \u0160mejda|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Michal \u0160mejda]]\n|}\n\n== League stage ==\n\n=== 7.

The club was founded in 1964 as a merger between two local clubs and was promoted to the Danish top-flight football league in 1981.\n\nBr\u00f8ndby IF has won ten [[Danish football champions|Danish Championships]] and seven [[Danish Cup]]s. Br\u00f8ndby's most successful period was from 1985 to 2005 when, in twenty years, they won all of their ten league titles. In [[1990\u201391 UEFA Cup|1991]], Br\u00f8ndby reached the semi-finals of the [[UEFA Cup]] and became the first and only Danish club to ever reach a European semi-final.\n\nSince the founding of fellow [[Copenhagen]] club [[F.C. Copenhagen]] in 1992 (a merger between [[Kj\u00f8benhavns Boldklub]] and [[Boldklubben 1903|B 1903]]), they have had a fierce rivalry; matches between the two clubs are referred to as the [[Copenhagen Derby]].\n\n==History==\n===Formation (1964&ndash;1977)===\n[[File:Brondby_won_cup.jpg|thumb]]\nBr\u00f8ndbyernes Idr\u00e6tsforening was formed on 3 December 1964 following a merger between two local rivals \u2013 '''Br\u00f8ndby\u00f8ster IF''' and '''[[:da:Br\u00f8ndbyvester IF|Br\u00f8ndbyvester IF]]'''. The merger was to be completed as a prerequisite for the construction of a new stadium by [[Br\u00f8ndby Municipality]].<ref name=\"Brock\">{{cite book|url=|title=Br\u00f8ndby IF : drengene fra Vestegnen|date=2011|publisher=Gyldendal|isbn=978-87-02-10258-1|editor-last=Brock|editor-first=Jeppe Laursen}}</ref> Br\u00f8ndby IF spent its inaugural season as an amateur club in the 6th tier of the 11 Danish leagues, the Serie 1, where they finished their two first seasons in fourth place. Among the players of the early years was team captain [[Per Bjerregaard]], a doctor who had moved to Copenhagen from [[Randers]] in [[Jutland]], and Hans Gregersen, who was the mascot of the team until his death by [[syphilis]] in 1967. In 1967, the club hired coach [[Leif Andersen]] who instantly secured promotion to ''Sj\u00e6llandsserien'' (the [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] series). After a few mediocre years, a new coach, John Sinding, was brought in, and the club won promotion to ''Danmarksserien'' (the Denmark series).\n\nIn 1973, Per Bjerregaard stopped his active career at 27 years of age and became chairman of Br\u00f8ndby; his first action was to sack head coach Sinding. In his place, Br\u00f8ndby hired former professional and [[Denmark national football team|Denmark national team]] player [[Finn Laudrup]], who took over as head coach while he still took actively part in the matches as a player. Laudrup joined his brother-in-law [[Ebbe Skovdahl]] in the Br\u00f8ndby team, and he brought his two young sons [[Brian Laudrup|Brian]] and [[Michael Laudrup]] with him to the club. Under Finn Laudrup's influence, the club's playing style was changed to a more attacking strategy, even though Laudrup decided to fully concentrate his efforts as a player after only a year. After winning promotion in 1974, Laudrup left Br\u00f8ndby in the 3rd Division in 1976 to play for [[Kj\u00f8benhavns Boldklub|KB]] in the Danish top-flight league (then named the 1st Division) and a year later Michael Laudrup, the brightest talent in Danish football, followed.\n\n===Professional football (1977&ndash;1987)===\nIn 1977, Br\u00f8ndby moved up into the 2nd Division, and were one of the clubs who quickly adapted to the new times of paid football in the best Danish leagues in 1978. Per Bjerregaard persuaded Finn Laudrup into returning to Br\u00f8ndby in 1981 on a professional contract, and following a season of 85 goals in 30 matches, Br\u00f8ndby won promotion to the top-flight 1st Division under coach [[Tom K\u00f8hlert]]. Finn Laudrup subsequently ended his career at age 36, but in his place Michael Laudrup returned for the [[1982 in Danish football|1982 season]], being one of ten players leaving KB that year.\n\nBr\u00f8ndby won their 1st Division debut match 7\u20131 over fellow [[promotion (sports)|promoted]] team [[Boldklubben 1909|B 1909]] in a match which featured two goals from Michael Laudrup. He was subsequently called up for the Denmark national team, and on 15 June 1982 he became the first Br\u00f8ndby player to win a [[cap (football)|cap]] for the national team. Br\u00f8ndby finished their first 1st Division season in fourth place with Laudrup the league's third top goal scorer with 15 goals, earning him the [[Danish Player of the Year]] award. In 1983, Laudrup was sold to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in the then-biggest transfer deal in Denmark, giving Br\u00f8ndby the economic foundation to expand further.\n\nAfter four years in the top division, Br\u00f8ndby won their first Danish championship in [[Danish 1st Division 1985|1985]] and played its first European match when the club beat [[Hungary|Hungarian]] champions [[Budapest Honv\u00e9d FC|Budapest Honv\u00e9d]] 4\u20131 in the 1986 [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]. In 1986, Br\u00f8ndby became the first Danish club of fully professionals when ten players were signed full-time, and the club was introduced at the [[Copenhagen Stock Exchange]] in 1987.\n\n===European success (1987&ndash;1992)===\nThroughout the second half of the 1980s, the team dominated the league and did not finish lower than second place until 1992. The team was built around talented Danish players, and from 1987 to 1991 players from Br\u00f8ndby won the Danish Player of the Year award every year. The recipients formed the backbone of the Denmark national team which later won [[UEFA Euro 1992]], and was the first goalscorer in the 2\u20130 Euro 1992 final win [[John Jensen|John \"Faxe\" Jensen]] (1987), national team captain [[Lars Olsen]] (1988), the World's Best [[Goalkeeper (association football)|Goalkeeper]] 1992 and 1993 award winner [[Peter Schmeichel]] (1989), four-time Danish Player of the Year award winner Brian Laudrup (1990) and the second goalscorer of the [[UEFA Euro 1992 Final|Euro 1992 final]] [[Kim Vilfort]] (1991). The club became used to winning the national title and turned its attention towards European success.\n\nIn 1990, Br\u00f8ndby hired former national team captain [[Morten Olsen]] as coach, and under his reign, the [[1990\u201391 UEFA Cup]] became the high point in the short history of the club. Especially the meriting wins over German sides [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] and [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]], and Russian club [[FC Torpedo Moscow|Torpedo Moscow]] saw the many Danish profiles shine, and the club was minutes from qualifying for the final match of the tournament. In the 88th minute of the semi-final, however, a [[Rudi V\u00f6ller]] goal denied Br\u00f8ndby a trip to the UEFA Cup final in favour of [[A.S. Roma|Roma]]. Following the impressive European display by the comparatively small club, important members of the team, including Lars Olsen, top scoring [[Striker (association football)|striker]] [[Bent Christensen Arens\u00f8e|Bent \"Turbo\" Christensen]] and star goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel, left the club.\n\nThe following year, 1992, was the worst year in the club's history as the intended takeover of the Danish bank [[Interbank]] went awry. It was expected that European Cup success would boost the Br\u00f8ndby stock value in order to finance the buy, but as the club was beaten by [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] in the [[1991\u201392 European Cup]] qualification, the stocks never reached the value necessary to finalize the deal. It had been arranged for financial backers Hafnia Insurance Company to step in and take over the buy in case Br\u00f8ndby could not finance it, but as Hafnia went [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]], Br\u00f8ndby were forced to buy Interbank and financial collapse was imminent as club debts amassed to 400 million [[Danish krone|DKK]].<ref>{{in lang|da}} Henrik H. Brandt, \"Br\u00f8ndby IF: Mirakelkuren\", ''[[Jyllands-Posten]] article'', 1 June 1997</ref> A long-term rescue plan was initiated to save the club, but these events influenced the performance of the team and the championship, now called the Danish Superliga, was not won again until [[1995\u201396 Danish Superliga|1996]].\n\n===Rebuilding (1992&ndash;2002)===\nThe rebuilding of the team was led by head coach [[Ebbe Skovdahl]], who deployed the team in a [[Formation (association football)#4\u20134\u20132|4-4-2 formation]]. The return to the club of Euro 1992 veterans John Jensen and captain Lars Olsen combined with the emergence of goalkeeper [[Mogens Krogh]] and striker [[Ebbe Sand]] got the club back on its feet. The rebuilding culminated in the [[1995\u201396 UEFA Cup]] elimination of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], though Roma once again knocked Br\u00f8ndby out. Including that year, Br\u00f8ndby won three Danish championships in a row, and [[1996\u201397 UEFA Cup|the next year's UEFA Cup]] saw one of the biggest upsets in Br\u00f8ndby history, as a 3\u20131 home defeat to [[Karlsruher SC]] was changed to an aggregate win when Br\u00f8ndby beat the team of [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 1996]] winner [[Thomas H\u00e4\u00dfler]] 5\u20130 away in Germany. Most importantly for the club's economy, Br\u00f8ndby qualified for the new format of the European Cup, rebranded as the UEFA Champions League.<ref name=\"First CL qualification\">\n\nDanish club [[AaB Fodbold|Aalborg BK]] played in the [[1995\u201396 UEFA Champions League|1995\u201396 Champions League]] tournament as a result of the bribing scandal of Dynamo Kyiv, thus they did not qualify through the qualification rounds.</ref> The Champions League qualification meant six guaranteed matches in a [[Round-robin tournament|group stage]] with three of the biggest teams of Europe, and when they were paired with [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and later finalists [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], Br\u00f8ndby faced very economically attractive matches. Despite winning 2\u20131 over Bayern in the first match of the group stage, Br\u00f8ndby conceded 18 goals in 6 matches and were eliminated with a single win to their name.\n\nSkovdahl decided to take a stab at coaching at Scottish club [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] and Br\u00f8ndby took a more [[Scandinavia]]n approach, in search of stable success in the European competitions with Norwegian club [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]] the role model.<ref>{{in lang|da}} Kurt Lassen and Thorsten Dam, \"Br\u00f8ndby enig med Hareide\", ''[[Berlingske Tidende]] article'', 17 April 1999</ref> The club hired Norwegian manager [[\u00c5ge Hareide]] in 2000, who proclaimed a shift in line-up to a more attacking [[Formation (association football)#4\u20133\u20133|4\u20133\u20133 system]]. With Hareide came a handful of Scandinavian players of whom especially [[Sweden national football team|Sweden national team]] player [[Mattias Jonson]] became a fan favourite.\n\nThe year 2000 was also the year the club finalized a planned expansion of Br\u00f8ndby Stadium from a 20,000 to a 29,000 capacity, making it the second largest stadium in Denmark, only trailing the [[Parken Stadium]] of [[F.C. Copenhagen]]. At the cost of 250&nbsp;million DKK, the vast expenditure was seen as a sign that the club was out of its former financial crisis.<ref>{{in lang|da}} Christian H\u00fcttemeier, \"Supertanker p\u00e5 succeskurs\", ''[[Politiken]] article'', 22 October 2000</ref> The building project was finalized in Autumn 2000, and on 22 October, 28,416 spectators saw Br\u00f8ndby beat [[Akademisk Boldklub]] 4\u20132 in the opening match of the rebuilt stadium.\n\nHareide's visions of a 4\u20133\u20133 system never worked out, and the team soon returned to the well-known 4\u20134\u20132 setup. As he slowly lost hold of a ten-point lead to rivals F.C. Copenhagen, gained in a great first half of the [[2001\u201302 Danish Superliga|2001\u201302 Superliga season]], Hareide took his leave in spring 2002 before the last matches of the season.<ref>{{in lang|da}} Mikael B\u00f8rsting and Jesper Tornvig Ludvigsen, \"FORUDS\u00c5 HAREIDES FALD\", ''[[B.T. (tabloid)|B.T.]] article'', 16 April 2002</ref> He was replaced by youth team coach Tom K\u00f8hlert, who, though reluctant to take the job, gave first team debuts to the top youth team players, most notably [[Thomas Kahlenberg]], who helped the club narrowly secure the championship win on [[goal difference]].\n\n===The Laudrup years (2002\u20132006)===\nIn the 2002\u201303 pre-season, Br\u00f8ndby announced that Danish icon Michael Laudrup was taking the manager seat in his old club with John Jensen, also a club legend, as his assistant. In their first season, there were massive cuts from the very large squad; ten players were put in the reserves squad or sold and a talent squad was established. The club was to rely even more home grown players as Br\u00f8ndby was already famous for developing very talented players. In the process, Laudrup told several players to find new clubs as he thought they would not fit in the playing style he wanted to implement.\n\n[[File:Michael Laudrup, 2005.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Laudrup as Br\u00f8ndby manager]]\n\nDuring the Laudrup era, Br\u00f8ndby won the [[double (association football)|Double]] in 2005, the latest championship the club has won. The club was relatively successful in the European competitions as [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] was beaten 2\u20131<ref>[http://www.scorespro.com/soccer/livescore/br%C3%B8ndby-if-vs-fc-schalke-04/27-11-2003/ Brondby IF&nbsp;\u2013 FC Schalke 04 : 2\u20131 (Match report)] ScoresPro.com</ref> in the [[2003\u201304 UEFA Cup]] but was later beaten by Laudrup's former club Barcelona, 0\u20131.<ref>[http://www.scorespro.com/soccer/livescore/br%C3%B8ndby-if-vs-fc-barcelona/26-02-2004/ Brondby IF&nbsp;\u2013 FC Barcelona 04 : 0\u20131 (Match report)] ScoresPro.com</ref>\n\nIn May 2006 it was announced that Laudrup and Jensen could not agree with the board of Br\u00f8ndby regarding an extension of their contracts, and the duo left the club.\n\n===Years of crisis (2006&ndash;2013)===\nThe two were replaced by Dutch coach [[Ren\u00e9 Meulensteen]], who had a rough start in charge of the first team. Together with newly appointed Anders Bjerregaard&nbsp;\u2013 son of director [[Per Bjerregaard]]&nbsp;\u2013 Meulensteen bought a number of questionable players in the final days of the summer transfer window. In the first matches, the new coach struggled with injuries among the key players and the team had problems living up to the expectations.\n\nMeulensteen resigned after six months, leaving Br\u00f8ndby in seventh position halfway through the [[2006\u201307 Danish Superliga|2006\u201307 Superliga]]. The official explanation for his departure was that his family could not settle in Denmark,<ref>[http://www.brondby.com/article.asp?aid=39710 Br\u00f8ndby f\u00e5r ny cheftr\u00e6ner], [[Brondby IF - official website]], 5 January 2007</ref> but soon after, the former coach revealed major infrastructural problems in the club's organization, calling the club \"a very sick patient requiring immediate attention\",<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/footballeurope/news/kind=2/newsid=593131.html Rivals' pity highlights Br\u00f8ndby gloom], [[UEFA.com]], 25 September 2007</ref> as well as cliques inside the first team. In order to solve the clique problems, he had gone to director Per Bjerregaard to fire three key players&nbsp;\u2013 [[Marcus Lantz]], [[Thomas Rytter]] and one club man [[Per Nielsen]] \u2013 in order to reestablish the balance in the first team squad, a demand Danish football experts later described as the quickest way of getting sacked.\n\nTom K\u00f8hlert took the managerial reins once more, this time as a permanent solution on a two-and-a-half-year contract.\n\nAfter losing 2\u20134 to [[AC Horsens|Horsens]] on 26 August, their 23rd consecutive away match without a victory, the team was greeted by approximately 200 furious fans and cries like \"die mercenaries\" and \"we are Br\u00f8ndby, who are you?\" on their return to Br\u00f8ndby.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politiken.dk/fodbold/article366502.ece|title=Rasende fans belejrede Br\u00f8ndbys bus|language=Danish|date=27 August 2007|accessdate=27 August 2007|publisher=[[Politiken]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929084156/http://politiken.dk/fodbold/article366502.ece|archive-date=29 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 August 2007, Per Bjerregaard announced that he resigned from the director seat, and instead took over as chairman of the board in Br\u00f8ndby IF. Shortly after his resignation, Peter Schmeichel announced that he was ready to purchase Br\u00f8ndby and become a director. The announcement divided the fans. Some praised the former player for trying to save the club, while others criticized him for bringing investor Aldo Petersen along, a keen supporter and former stockholder of rivals F.C. Copenhagen. Schmeihel's offer, however, was rejected. On 1 April 2008, Hermann Haraldsson was appointed to the vacant position.<ref>{{in lang|da}} [http://www.brondby.com/upload/biffile_h8zlc6msaabfwk3aq9hj_46124.pdf Fondsb\u00f8rsmeddelelse September 2008], Br\u00f8ndbyernes IF Fodbold A/S, 13 March 2008</ref>\n\nFollowing a disappointing beginning of the [[2007\u201308 Danish Superliga|2007\u201308 Superliga season]] with only five points gained from seven matches, manager Tom K\u00f8hlert made it clear in August 2007 that the [[Danish Cup]] now had a higher priority for the club.<ref>{{in lang|da}} [http://politiken.dk/fodbold/article367318.ece Br\u00f8ndby opprioriterer pokalturneringen] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006134124/http://politiken.dk/fodbold/article367318.ece |date=6 October 2008 }}, politiken.dk, 28 June 2008</ref> The change of priorities was successful, and Br\u00f8ndby won their first domestic title in almost three years on 1 May 2008 when [[Esbjerg fB|Esbjerg]] were defeated 3\u20132 in the final of the [[2007\u201308 Danish Cup]].\n\nSoon after, manager K\u00f8hlert declared his job complete, prompting club chairman Bjerregaard to search for his replacement. On 16 June 2008, the club announced the appointment of former player and head coach of Horsens, [[Kent Nielsen]].<ref>[http://www.brondby.com/article.asp?aid=47333 FBM nr 13/2008: Kent Nielsen ny tr\u00e6ner pr. 1.1. 2009], [[Brondby - official website]], 16 June 2008</ref> Nielsen took charge of the first team on 1 January 2009. Former legendary coach K\u00f8hlert led Br\u00f8ndby to the first place, where they stayed until Nielsen arrived.\n\nOn 1 July 2008, KasiGroup replaced Codan as the main sponsor of the club. The partnership involved a cooperation with [[UNICEF]], making Br\u00f8ndby the third club in Europe next to Barcelona and Swedish side [[Hammarby Fotboll]] to wear the UNICEF logo on their shirts. Furthermore, KasiGroup entered a sponsorship for the stadium and promised substantial funds for taking the player squad to the next level. During the 2008 summer break, this contributed to Br\u00f8ndby transferring five new players with national team experience in order to strengthen the team.\n\nOn 30 December 2009, KasiGroup owner Jesper Nielsen got in trouble with Br\u00f8ndby and refused to pay the remainder of the money. On 31 August 2012, Br\u00f8ndby told the Danish media B.T. that KasiGroup now owes the club more than 45&nbsp;million DKK (\u20ac6,000,000 / \u00a35,000,000).<ref>[http://www.sporten.dk/fodbold/broendby-vi-skal-have-kasi-millioner Br\u00f8ndby: Vi skal have Kasi-millioner] 31 August 2012</ref> The two will meet in court next year. Nielsen told B.T. that he could recognize the amount but that his lawyer thought they could make a settlement at a much lower figure than the 45&nbsp;million.\n\nNielsen was the owner of [[AG K\u00f8benhavn]], which went bankrupt on 31 July 2012 due to his overuse of money. Nielsen is thus both chased by Br\u00f8ndby and the Danish tax authorities.<ref>[http://www.dr.dk/Sporten/Haandbold/Liga_maend/2012/08/06/083157.htm SKAT kr\u00e6ver 168 millioner af Kasi-familien] 6 August 2012</ref> Br\u00f8ndby is still looking for a new main sponsor as it has not been possible to find one yet.

A part of the merging of Br\u00f8ndbyvester IF and Br\u00f8ndby\u00f8ster IF was a promise by the Br\u00f8ndby municipality mayor to build a ground, and in 1965 it was ready for the club to play in. Through the first years in the secondary Danish leagues, the stadium was little more than a grass field with an [[sport of athletics|athletics]] track circling the field of play. It was not until 1978 that the main stand was built, sporting a capacity of 1,200 seated spectators. As newly promoted to the top Danish league in 1982, concrete terraces opposite the main stand were constructed, allowing for a crowd of 5,000 additional people. Following the first years of success in the top-flight, the athletic track was discarded and a further 2,000 seats were installed on top of the concrete stands from 1989 to 1990.\n\nWhen Br\u00f8ndby played matches against other successful European teams in the 1990\u201391 UEFA Cup, the then capacity of up to 10,000 spectators was quickly dwarfed by the ticket interest. As the Denmark national stadium [[Idr\u00e6tsparken]] in Copenhagen was being rebuilt, the club found no other way to host the matches but to get a dispensation to use [[scaffolding]] stands, which boosted the stadium capacity to 18,000 in the semi-final leg of the tournament, a 0\u20130 draw with Roma. Following the European adventure, the club inaugurated its end stands in 1992, allowing for a total of 22,000 spectators.\n\nIn May 1998, the club bought Br\u00f8ndby Stadium from the Br\u00f8ndby municipality for 23.5&nbsp;million DKK<ref>{{in lang|da}} Christian W. Larsen, \"Br\u00f8ndby f\u00e5r eget stadion\", ''[[Aktuelt]] article'', 14 May 1998</ref> and immediately spent double that amount to modernize the stadium. When the club qualified for the [[1998\u201399 UEFA Champions League]], the stadium was still under construction and the matches were moved to archrival F.C. Copenhagen's [[Parken Stadium]]. In 2000, all stands were standardized and built to the same height, allowing for crowds of 29,000 at domestic matches and 22,000 in the European matches, which allow only [[all-seater|all-seated]] crowds. Since then, the stadium has seen a number of lesser or larger infrastructural and technical enhancements, and the February 2004 European match against Barcelona was played in front of a 26,031-spectator crowd.\n\n==Organisation==\nBr\u00f8ndbyernes Idr\u00e6tsforening was founded on 3 December 1964 as a merger between two small clubs, Br\u00f8ndbyvester IF from 1909 and Br\u00f8ndby\u00f8ster IF from 1928, and was a broad sports association, including branches in football, [[team handball|handball]], gymnastics and badminton among others. In 1971 the club was split off into clubs for each individual sport, and Br\u00f8ndby mayor [[Kjeld Rasmussen]] became the first chairman of the footballing branch, which retained the name of Br\u00f8ndbyernes Idr\u00e6tsforening.\n\nWith the introduction of paid football in Denmark by the [[Danish Football Association]] in 1978, the club split into an amateur and a professional department. The amateurs consisted of the various youth departments which had been the trademark of the club since the 1964 merger, as well as the numerous volunteers who service every match of the professional club for free. In 1987 the professional department, Br\u00f8ndby IF Fodbold A/S, was the second football club in the world (with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] being the first) to float its [[share (finance)|shares]] on a public [[stock exchange]]. The shares were divided in A and B shares of equal value, with only the B shares for sale to the public. Each A share counts for ten votes and each B share counts for a single ownership vote, and the A shares were divided between three groups to prevent hostile takeovers; the volunteer amateur leaders of the club, the main sponsors of the club, and the company Euro Sportsholding, owned by Br\u00f8ndby IF itself. The A shares accounted for 64% of the votes,<ref>{{in lang|da}} Michael Aae, \"A/S FODBOLD ET HOLD TIL 70 MILLIONER\", ''[[B.T. (tabloid)|B.T.]] article'', 18 August 1991</ref> and thereby the power in the club.\n\nWhen the club was on the verge of financial collapse in 1992, the A shares posed as security to the creditors, until the club was saved and the shares were sold for the symbolic amount of 1 DKK<ref>{{in lang|da}} Steen Ankerdal, \"Fik br\u00f8ndby for en krone\", ''[[Ekstra Bladet]] article'', 7 May 1994</ref> to the newly founded Br\u00f8ndbyernes IF Fodbold Fond, which strives to keep Br\u00f8ndby IF controlled by the amateur department. The shares are currently divided into 355,000 A and 3,500,000 B shares, with Br\u00f8ndbyernes IF Fodbold Fond owning 300,000 of the A shares, accounting for 42.6% of the total votes.<ref>{{in lang|da}} [http://www.brondby.com/article.asp?aid=36 Distribution of shares], according to Brondby.com</ref>\n\n==Support==\nBr\u00f8ndby are the most widely popular football club in Denmark, with a 2015 study having showed that Br\u00f8ndby matches have by far the most viewers, both in the stadium and on TV.

The club was founded in 1964 as a merger between two local clubs and was promoted to the Danish top-flight football league in 1981.\n\nBr\u00f8ndby IF has won ten [[Danish football champions|Danish Championships]] and seven [[Danish Cup]]s. Br\u00f8ndby's most successful period was from 1985 to 2005 when, in twenty years, they won all of their ten league titles. In [[1990\u201391 UEFA Cup|1991]], Br\u00f8ndby reached the semi-finals of the [[UEFA Cup]] and became the first and only Danish club to ever reach a European semi-final.\n\nSince the founding of fellow [[Copenhagen]] club [[F.C. Copenhagen]] in 1992 (a merger between [[Kj\u00f8benhavns Boldklub]] and [[Boldklubben 1903|B 1903]]), they have had a fierce rivalry; matches between the two clubs are referred to as the [[Copenhagen Derby]].\n\n==History==\n===Formation (1964&ndash;1977)===\n[[File:Brondby_won_cup.jpg|thumb]]\nBr\u00f8ndbyernes Idr\u00e6tsforening was formed on 3 December 1964 following a merger between two local rivals \u2013 '''Br\u00f8ndby\u00f8ster IF''' and '''[[:da:Br\u00f8ndbyvester IF|Br\u00f8ndbyvester IF]]'''. The merger was to be completed as a prerequisite for the construction of a new stadium by [[Br\u00f8ndby Municipality]].<ref name=\"Brock\">{{cite book|url=|title=Br\u00f8ndby IF : drengene fra Vestegnen|date=2011|publisher=Gyldendal|isbn=978-87-02-10258-1|editor-last=Brock|editor-first=Jeppe Laursen}}</ref> Br\u00f8ndby IF spent its inaugural season as an amateur club in the 6th tier of the 11 Danish leagues, the Serie 1, where they finished their two first seasons in fourth place. Among the players of the early years was team captain [[Per Bjerregaard]], a doctor who had moved to Copenhagen from [[Randers]] in [[Jutland]], and Hans Gregersen, who was the mascot of the team until his death by [[syphilis]] in 1967. In 1967, the club hired coach [[Leif Andersen]] who instantly secured promotion to ''Sj\u00e6llandsserien'' (the [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] series). After a few mediocre years, a new coach, John Sinding, was brought in, and the club won promotion to ''Danmarksserien'' (the Denmark series).\n\nIn 1973, Per Bjerregaard stopped his active career at 27 years of age and became chairman of Br\u00f8ndby; his first action was to sack head coach Sinding. In his place, Br\u00f8ndby hired former professional and [[Denmark national football team|Denmark national team]] player [[Finn Laudrup]], who took over as head coach while he still took actively part in the matches as a player. Laudrup joined his brother-in-law [[Ebbe Skovdahl]] in the Br\u00f8ndby team, and he brought his two young sons [[Brian Laudrup|Brian]] and [[Michael Laudrup]] with him to the club. Under Finn Laudrup's influence, the club's playing style was changed to a more attacking strategy, even though Laudrup decided to fully concentrate his efforts as a player after only a year. After winning promotion in 1974, Laudrup left Br\u00f8ndby in the 3rd Division in 1976 to play for [[Kj\u00f8benhavns Boldklub|KB]] in the Danish top-flight league (then named the 1st Division) and a year later Michael Laudrup, the brightest talent in Danish football, followed.\n\n===Professional football (1977&ndash;1987)===\nIn 1977, Br\u00f8ndby moved up into the 2nd Division, and were one of the clubs who quickly adapted to the new times of paid football in the best Danish leagues in 1978. Per Bjerregaard persuaded Finn Laudrup into returning to Br\u00f8ndby in 1981 on a professional contract, and following a season of 85 goals in 30 matches, Br\u00f8ndby won promotion to the top-flight 1st Division under coach [[Tom K\u00f8hlert]]. Finn Laudrup subsequently ended his career at age 36, but in his place Michael Laudrup returned for the [[1982 in Danish football|1982 season]], being one of ten players leaving KB that year.\n\nBr\u00f8ndby won their 1st Division debut match 7\u20131 over fellow [[promotion (sports)|promoted]] team [[Boldklubben 1909|B 1909]] in a match which featured two goals from Michael Laudrup. He was subsequently called up for the Denmark national team, and on 15 June 1982 he became the first Br\u00f8ndby player to win a [[cap (football)|cap]] for the national team. Br\u00f8ndby finished their first 1st Division season in fourth place with Laudrup the league's third top goal scorer with 15 goals, earning him the [[Danish Player of the Year]] award. In 1983, Laudrup was sold to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in the then-biggest transfer deal in Denmark, giving Br\u00f8ndby the economic foundation to expand further.\n\nAfter four years in the top division, Br\u00f8ndby won their first Danish championship in [[Danish 1st Division 1985|1985]] and played its first European match when the club beat [[Hungary|Hungarian]] champions [[Budapest Honv\u00e9d FC|Budapest Honv\u00e9d]] 4\u20131 in the 1986 [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]. In 1986, Br\u00f8ndby became the first Danish club of fully professionals when ten players were signed full-time, and the club was introduced at the [[Copenhagen Stock Exchange]] in 1987.\n\n===European success (1987&ndash;1992)===\nThroughout the second half of the 1980s, the team dominated the league and did not finish lower than second place until 1992. The team was built around talented Danish players, and from 1987 to 1991 players from Br\u00f8ndby won the Danish Player of the Year award every year. The recipients formed the backbone of the Denmark national team which later won [[UEFA Euro 1992]], and was the first goalscorer in the 2\u20130 Euro 1992 final win [[John Jensen|John \"Faxe\" Jensen]] (1987), national team captain [[Lars Olsen]] (1988), the World's Best [[Goalkeeper (association football)|Goalkeeper]] 1992 and 1993 award winner [[Peter Schmeichel]] (1989), four-time Danish Player of the Year award winner Brian Laudrup (1990) and the second goalscorer of the [[UEFA Euro 1992 Final|Euro 1992 final]] [[Kim Vilfort]] (1991). The club became used to winning the national title and turned its attention towards European success.\n\nIn 1990, Br\u00f8ndby hired former national team captain [[Morten Olsen]] as coach, and under his reign, the [[1990\u201391 UEFA Cup]] became the high point in the short history of the club. Especially the meriting wins over German sides [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] and [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]], and Russian club [[FC Torpedo Moscow|Torpedo Moscow]] saw the many Danish profiles shine, and the club was minutes from qualifying for the final match of the tournament. In the 88th minute of the semi-final, however, a [[Rudi V\u00f6ller]] goal denied Br\u00f8ndby a trip to the UEFA Cup final in favour of [[A.S. Roma|Roma]]. Following the impressive European display by the comparatively small club, important members of the team, including Lars Olsen, top scoring [[Striker (association football)|striker]] [[Bent Christensen Arens\u00f8e|Bent \"Turbo\" Christensen]] and star goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel, left the club.\n\nThe following year, 1992, was the worst year in the club's history as the intended takeover of the Danish bank [[Interbank]] went awry. It was expected that European Cup success would boost the Br\u00f8ndby stock value in order to finance the buy, but as the club was beaten by [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] in the [[1991\u201392 European Cup]] qualification, the stocks never reached the value necessary to finalize the deal. It had been arranged for financial backers Hafnia Insurance Company to step in and take over the buy in case Br\u00f8ndby could not finance it, but as Hafnia went [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]], Br\u00f8ndby were forced to buy Interbank and financial collapse was imminent as club debts amassed to 400 million [[Danish krone|DKK]].<ref>{{in lang|da}} Henrik H. Brandt, \"Br\u00f8ndby IF: Mirakelkuren\", ''[[Jyllands-Posten]] article'', 1 June 1997</ref> A long-term rescue plan was initiated to save the club, but these events influenced the performance of the team and the championship, now called the Danish Superliga, was not won again until [[1995\u201396 Danish Superliga|1996]].\n\n===Rebuilding (1992&ndash;2002)===\nThe rebuilding of the team was led by head coach [[Ebbe Skovdahl]], who deployed the team in a [[Formation (association football)#4\u20134\u20132|4-4-2 formation]]. The return to the club of Euro 1992 veterans John Jensen and captain Lars Olsen combined with the emergence of goalkeeper [[Mogens Krogh]] and striker [[Ebbe Sand]] got the club back on its feet. The rebuilding culminated in the [[1995\u201396 UEFA Cup]] elimination of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], though Roma once again knocked Br\u00f8ndby out. Including that year, Br\u00f8ndby won three Danish championships in a row, and [[1996\u201397 UEFA Cup|the next year's UEFA Cup]] saw one of the biggest upsets in Br\u00f8ndby history, as a 3\u20131 home defeat to [[Karlsruher SC]] was changed to an aggregate win when Br\u00f8ndby beat the team of [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 1996]] winner [[Thomas H\u00e4\u00dfler]] 5\u20130 away in Germany. Most importantly for the club's economy, Br\u00f8ndby qualified for the new format of the European Cup, rebranded as the UEFA Champions League.<ref name=\"First CL qualification\">\n\nDanish club [[AaB Fodbold|Aalborg BK]] played in the [[1995\u201396 UEFA Champions League|1995\u201396 Champions League]] tournament as a result of the bribing scandal of Dynamo Kyiv, thus they did not qualify through the qualification rounds.</ref> The Champions League qualification meant six guaranteed matches in a [[Round-robin tournament|group stage]] with three of the biggest teams of Europe, and when they were paired with [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and later finalists [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], Br\u00f8ndby faced very economically attractive matches. Despite winning 2\u20131 over Bayern in the first match of the group stage, Br\u00f8ndby conceded 18 goals in 6 matches and were eliminated with a single win to their name.\n\nSkovdahl decided to take a stab at coaching at Scottish club [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] and Br\u00f8ndby took a more [[Scandinavia]]n approach, in search of stable success in the European competitions with Norwegian club [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]] the role model.<ref>{{in lang|da}} Kurt Lassen and Thorsten Dam, \"Br\u00f8ndby enig med Hareide\", ''[[Berlingske Tidende]] article'', 17 April 1999</ref> The club hired Norwegian manager [[\u00c5ge Hareide]] in 2000, who proclaimed a shift in line-up to a more attacking [[Formation (association football)#4\u20133\u20133|4\u20133\u20133 system]]. With Hareide came a handful of Scandinavian players of whom especially [[Sweden national football team|Sweden national team]] player [[Mattias Jonson]] became a fan favourite.\n\nThe year 2000 was also the year the club finalized a planned expansion of Br\u00f8ndby Stadium from a 20,000 to a 29,000 capacity, making it the second largest stadium in Denmark, only trailing the [[Parken Stadium]] of [[F.C. Copenhagen]]. At the cost of 250&nbsp;million DKK, the vast expenditure was seen as a sign that the club was out of its former financial crisis.<ref>{{in lang|da}} Christian H\u00fcttemeier, \"Supertanker p\u00e5 succeskurs\", ''[[Politiken]] article'', 22 October 2000</ref> The building project was finalized in Autumn 2000, and on 22 October, 28,416 spectators saw Br\u00f8ndby beat [[Akademisk Boldklub]] 4\u20132 in the opening match of the rebuilt stadium.\n\nHareide's visions of a 4\u20133\u20133 system never worked out, and the team soon returned to the well-known 4\u20134\u20132 setup. As he slowly lost hold of a ten-point lead to rivals F.C. Copenhagen, gained in a great first half of the [[2001\u201302 Danish Superliga|2001\u201302 Superliga season]], Hareide took his leave in spring 2002 before the last matches of the season.<ref>{{in lang|da}} Mikael B\u00f8rsting and Jesper Tornvig Ludvigsen, \"FORUDS\u00c5 HAREIDES FALD\", ''[[B.T.

In their first season, there were massive cuts from the very large squad; ten players were put in the reserves squad or sold and a talent squad was established. The club was to rely even more home grown players as Br\u00f8ndby was already famous for developing very talented players. In the process, Laudrup told several players to find new clubs as he thought they would not fit in the playing style he wanted to implement.\n\n[[File:Michael Laudrup, 2005.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Laudrup as Br\u00f8ndby manager]]\n\nDuring the Laudrup era, Br\u00f8ndby won the [[double (association football)|Double]] in 2005, the latest championship the club has won.

Together with newly appointed Anders Bjerregaard&nbsp;\u2013 son of director [[Per Bjerregaard]]&nbsp;\u2013 Meulensteen bought a number of questionable players in the final days of the summer transfer window. In the first matches, the new coach struggled with injuries among the key players and the team had problems living up to the expectations.\n\nMeulensteen resigned after six months, leaving Br\u00f8ndby in seventh position halfway through the [[2006\u201307 Danish Superliga|2006\u201307 Superliga]]. The official explanation for his departure was that his family could not settle in Denmark,<ref>[http://www.brondby.com/article.asp?aid=39710 Br\u00f8ndby f\u00e5r ny cheftr\u00e6ner], [[Brondby IF - official website]], 5 January 2007</ref> but soon after, the former coach revealed major infrastructural problems in the club's organization, calling the club \"a very sick patient requiring immediate attention\",<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/footballeurope/news/kind=2/newsid=593131.html Rivals' pity highlights Br\u00f8ndby gloom], [[UEFA.com]], 25 September 2007</ref> as well as cliques inside the first team. In order to solve the clique problems, he had gone to director Per Bjerregaard to fire three key players&nbsp;\u2013 [[Marcus Lantz]], [[Thomas Rytter]] and one club man [[Per Nielsen]] \u2013 in order to reestablish the balance in the first team squad, a demand Danish football experts later described as the quickest way of getting sacked.\n\nTom K\u00f8hlert took the managerial reins once more, this time as a permanent solution on a two-and-a-half-year contract.\n\nAfter losing 2\u20134 to [[AC Horsens|Horsens]] on 26 August, their 23rd consecutive away match without a victory, the team was greeted by approximately 200 furious fans and cries like \"die mercenaries\" and \"we are Br\u00f8ndby, who are you?\" on their return to Br\u00f8ndby.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politiken.dk/fodbold/article366502.ece|title=Rasende fans belejrede Br\u00f8ndbys bus|language=Danish|date=27 August 2007|accessdate=27 August 2007|publisher=[[Politiken]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929084156/http://politiken.dk/fodbold/article366502.ece|archive-date=29 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 August 2007, Per Bjerregaard announced that he resigned from the director seat, and instead took over as chairman of the board in Br\u00f8ndby IF. Shortly after his resignation, Peter Schmeichel announced that he was ready to purchase Br\u00f8ndby and become a director. The announcement divided the fans. Some praised the former player for trying to save the club, while others criticized him for bringing investor Aldo Petersen along, a keen supporter and former stockholder of rivals F.C. Copenhagen. Schmeihel's offer, however, was rejected.

On 16 June 2008, the club announced the appointment of former player and head coach of Horsens, [[Kent Nielsen]].<ref>[http://www.brondby.com/article.asp?aid=47333 FBM nr 13/2008: Kent Nielsen ny tr\u00e6ner pr. 1.1. 2009], [[Brondby - official website]], 16 June 2008</ref> Nielsen took charge of the first team on 1 January 2009. Former legendary coach K\u00f8hlert led Br\u00f8ndby to the first place, where they stayed until Nielsen arrived.\n\nOn 1 July 2008, KasiGroup replaced Codan as the main sponsor of the club. The partnership involved a cooperation with [[UNICEF]], making Br\u00f8ndby the third club in Europe next to Barcelona and Swedish side [[Hammarby Fotboll]] to wear the UNICEF logo on their shirts. Furthermore, KasiGroup entered a sponsorship for the stadium and promised substantial funds for taking the player squad to the next level. During the 2008 summer break, this contributed to Br\u00f8ndby transferring five new players with national team experience in order to strengthen the team.\n\nOn 30 December 2009, KasiGroup owner Jesper Nielsen got in trouble with Br\u00f8ndby and refused to pay the remainder of the money. On 31 August 2012, Br\u00f8ndby told the Danish media B.T. that KasiGroup now owes the club more than 45&nbsp;million DKK (\u20ac6,000,000 / \u00a35,000,000).<ref>[http://www.sporten.dk/fodbold/broendby-vi-skal-have-kasi-millioner Br\u00f8ndby: Vi skal have Kasi-millioner] 31 August 2012</ref> The two will meet in court next year. Nielsen told B.T. that he could recognize the amount but that his lawyer thought they could make a settlement at a much lower figure than the 45&nbsp;million.\n\nNielsen was the owner of [[AG K\u00f8benhavn]], which went bankrupt on 31 July 2012 due to his overuse of money. Nielsen is thus both chased by Br\u00f8ndby and the Danish tax authorities.<ref>[http://www.dr.dk/Sporten/Haandbold/Liga_maend/2012/08/06/083157.htm SKAT kr\u00e6ver 168 millioner af Kasi-familien] 6 August 2012</ref> Br\u00f8ndby is still looking for a new main sponsor as it has not been possible to find one yet.

A part of the merging of Br\u00f8ndbyvester IF and Br\u00f8ndby\u00f8ster IF was a promise by the Br\u00f8ndby municipality mayor to build a ground, and in 1965 it was ready for the club to play in. Through the first years in the secondary Danish leagues, the stadium was little more than a grass field with an [[sport of athletics|athletics]] track circling the field of play. It was not until 1978 that the main stand was built, sporting a capacity of 1,200 seated spectators. As newly promoted to the top Danish league in 1982, concrete terraces opposite the main stand were constructed, allowing for a crowd of 5,000 additional people. Following the first years of success in the top-flight, the athletic track was discarded and a further 2,000 seats were installed on top of the concrete stands from 1989 to 1990.\n\nWhen Br\u00f8ndby played matches against other successful European teams in the 1990\u201391 UEFA Cup, the then capacity of up to 10,000 spectators was quickly dwarfed by the ticket interest. As the Denmark national stadium [[Idr\u00e6tsparken]] in Copenhagen was being rebuilt, the club found no other way to host the matches but to get a dispensation to use [[scaffolding]] stands, which boosted the stadium capacity to 18,000 in the semi-final leg of the tournament, a 0\u20130 draw with Roma. Following the European adventure, the club inaugurated its end stands in 1992, allowing for a total of 22,000 spectators.\n\nIn May 1998, the club bought Br\u00f8ndby Stadium from the Br\u00f8ndby municipality for 23.5&nbsp;million DKK<ref>{{in lang|da}} Christian W. Larsen, \"Br\u00f8ndby f\u00e5r eget stadion\", ''[[Aktuelt]] article'', 14 May 1998</ref> and immediately spent double that amount to modernize the stadium. When the club qualified for the [[1998\u201399 UEFA Champions League]], the stadium was still under construction and the matches were moved to archrival F.C. Copenhagen's [[Parken Stadium]]. In 2000, all stands were standardized and built to the same height, allowing for crowds of 29,000 at domestic matches and 22,000 in the European matches, which allow only [[all-seater|all-seated]] crowds. Since then, the stadium has seen a number of lesser or larger infrastructural and technical enhancements, and the February 2004 European match against Barcelona was played in front of a 26,031-spectator crowd.\n\n==Organisation==\nBr\u00f8ndbyernes Idr\u00e6tsforening was founded on 3 December 1964 as a merger between two small clubs, Br\u00f8ndbyvester IF from 1909 and Br\u00f8ndby\u00f8ster IF from 1928, and was a broad sports association, including branches in football, [[team handball|handball]], gymnastics and badminton among others. In 1971 the club was split off into clubs for each individual sport, and Br\u00f8ndby mayor [[Kjeld Rasmussen]] became the first chairman of the footballing branch, which retained the name of Br\u00f8ndbyernes Idr\u00e6tsforening.\n\nWith the introduction of paid football in Denmark by the [[Danish Football Association]] in 1978, the club split into an amateur and a professional department. The amateurs consisted of the various youth departments which had been the trademark of the club since the 1964 merger, as well as the numerous volunteers who service every match of the professional club for free. In 1987 the professional department, Br\u00f8ndby IF Fodbold A/S, was the second football club in the world (with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] being the first) to float its [[share (finance)|shares]] on a public [[stock exchange]]. The shares were divided in A and B shares of equal value, with only the B shares for sale to the public. Each A share counts for ten votes and each B share counts for a single ownership vote, and the A shares were divided between three groups to prevent hostile takeovers; the volunteer amateur leaders of the club, the main sponsors of the club, and the company Euro Sportsholding, owned by Br\u00f8ndby IF itself. The A shares accounted for 64% of the votes,<ref>{{in lang|da}} Michael Aae, \"A/S FODBOLD ET HOLD TIL 70 MILLIONER\", ''[[B.T. (tabloid)|B.T.]] article'', 18 August 1991</ref> and thereby the power in the club.\n\nWhen the club was on the verge of financial collapse in 1992, the A shares posed as security to the creditors, until the club was saved and the shares were sold for the symbolic amount of 1 DKK<ref>{{in lang|da}} Steen Ankerdal, \"Fik br\u00f8ndby for en krone\", ''[[Ekstra Bladet]] article'', 7 May 1994</ref> to the newly founded Br\u00f8ndbyernes IF Fodbold Fond, which strives to keep Br\u00f8ndby IF controlled by the amateur department. The shares are currently divided into 355,000 A and 3,500,000 B shares, with Br\u00f8ndbyernes IF Fodbold Fond owning 300,000 of the A shares, accounting for 42.6% of the total votes.<ref>{{in lang|da}} [http://www.brondby.com/article.asp?aid=36 Distribution of shares], according to Brondby.com</ref>\n\n==Support==\nBr\u00f8ndby are the most widely popular football club in Denmark, with a 2015 study having showed that Br\u00f8ndby matches have by far the most viewers, both in the stadium and on TV.

The ashram grew out of a small community of disciples who had gathered around [[Sri Aurobindo]] after he retired from politics and settled in Pondicherry in 1910. On 24 November 1926, after a major spiritual realization, Sri Aurobindo withdrew from public view in order to continue his spiritual work. At this time he handed over the full responsibility for the inner and outer lives of the ''sadhaks'' (spiritual aspirants) and the ashram to his spiritual collaborator, \"the Mother\", earlier known as [[Mirra Alfassa]]. This date is therefore generally known as the founding-day of the ashram, though, as Sri Aurobindo himself wrote, it had \u201cless been created than grown around him as its centre.\u201d<ref>Sri Aurobindo, ''Autobiographical Notes and Other Writings of Historical Interest'' (Pondicherry: Sri Aurobindo Ashram, 2006), p. 9.</ref>\n\n== History ==\nLife in the community that preceded the ashram was informal. Sri Aurobindo spent most of his time in writing and meditation. The three or four young men who had followed him to Pondicherry in 1910 lived with him and looked after the household. Otherwise they were free to do as they wished. The Mother and French writer Paul Richard met Sri Aurobindo in 1914 and proposed that they bring out a monthly review; but after the outbreak of World War I, they were obliged to leave India, and Sri Aurobindo had to do almost all of the work on the review himself, helped a little by the young men who were living with him. In April 1920 the Mother returned to Pondicherry, and soon the community began to take the form of an ashram, more because the ''sadhaks'' \u201cdesired to entrust their whole inner and outer life to the Mother than from any intention or plan of hers or of Sri Aurobindo.\u201d<ref>''Autobiographical Notes'', p. 103.</ref> After the ashram was given formal shape in 1926, it experienced a period of rapid growth, increasing from around 24 in the beginning of 1927 to more than 150 in 1934.<ref>Sri Aurobindo, ''Letters on Himself and the Ashram'' (Pondicherry: Sri Aurobindo Ashram, 2011), p. 581.</ref> The membership leveled off in 1934 owing to a lack of suitable housing.\n\nDuring these years there was a regular routine. At 6:00 every morning the Mother appeared on the ashram balcony to initiate the day with her blessings. ''Sadhaks'' would have woken very early and completed a good portion of the day\u2019s work including meditation and then assembled under the balcony to receive her blessings.<ref>Karmayogi ''Life and Teachings of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother'', Mere Cie, Inc. [http://www.motherservice.org/Life%20&%20Teachings/Life%20and%20Teachings.htm online]</ref>\n\nAs the ashram grew, many departments came up and were looked after by the ''sadhaks'' as part of their ''sadhana'': the offices, library, dining room, book/photograph printing, workshops, sports/playground, art gallery, dispensary/nursing home, farms, dairies, flower gardens, guest houses, laundry, bakery, etc. The heads of the departments met the Mother in the morning and took her blessings and orders. She would meet the sadhaks individually again at 10 am and, in the evening at 5:30 pm, she would conduct meditation and meet the sadhaks.\n\nIn addition, four times a year Sri Aurobindo and the Mother used to give public [[Dar\u015bana|Darshan]]s (spiritual gatherings where the guru bestows blessings) to thousands of devotees gathered to receive grace.\n\n== Present ==\n[[File:Aurobindo Ashram Pondichery - Outside view.jpg|thumbnail|People waiting in a queue to get inside the ashram]]\nOnce confined to a few buildings in one corner of Pondicherry, the ashram\u2019s growth has caused it to expand physically in all directions. Today Ashramites live and work in more than 400 buildings spread throughout the town. The central focus of the community is one group of houses including those in which Sri Aurobindo and the Mother dwelt for most of their lives in Pondicherry. This interconnected block of houses \u2014 called \u201cthe Ashram main-building\u201d, or more usually just \u201cthe Ashram\u201d \u2014 surrounds a tree-shaded courtyard, at the centre of which lies the flower-covered \u201cSamadhi\u201d. This white marble shrine holds, in two separate chambers, the physical remains of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother.\n\nToday, Pondicherry has become an important destination for spiritual seekers as well as tourists. Thousands of visitors from all over the world come to the ashram.\n\nThe visiting hours for the visitors are from 8 am to 12 noon and then again from 2 pm to 6 pm.\n\n== Aims and ideals ==\nThe Ashram, according to Sri Aurobindo, \u201chas been created with another object than that ordinarily common to such institutions, not for the renunciation of the world but as a centre and a field of practice for the evolution of another kind and form of life which would in the final end be moved by a higher spiritual consciousness and embody a greater life of the spirit.\u201d<ref>''Letters on Himself and the Ashram'', p. 593.</ref>\n\nThe practice of Integral Yoga, Sri Aurobindo explained, \u201ddoes not proceed through any set mental teaching or prescribed forms of meditation, mantras or others, but by aspiration, by a self-concentration inwards or upwards, by self-opening to an Influence, to the Divine Power above us and its workings, to the Divine Presence in the heart, and by the rejection of all that is foreign to these things.\u201d<ref>Sri Aurobindo, ''Letters on Yoga \u2013 II'' (Pondicherry: Sri Aurobindo Ashram, 2013), p. 20.</ref>\n\n{{quotation|There are many things belonging to older systems that are necessary on the way \u2014 an opening of the mind to a greater wideness and to the sense of the Self and the Infinite, an emergence into what has been called the cosmic consciousness, mastery over the desires and passions; an outward asceticism is not essential, but the conquest of desire and attachment and a control over the body and its needs, greeds and instincts are indispensable. There is a combination of the principles of the old systems, the way of knowledge through the mind\u2019s discernment between Reality and the appearance, the heart\u2019s way of devotion, love and surrender and the way of works turning the will away from motives of self-interest to the Truth and the service of a greater Reality than the ego. For the whole being has to be trained so that it can respond and be transformed when it is possible for that greater Light and Force to work in the nature.|Sri Aurobindo<ref>''Autobiographical Notes'', p. 549.</ref>}}\n\nThe complete method of Integral Yoga aims to transform human life into a divine life. In Sri Aurobindo's yoga, the highest aim is the state of being one with the Divine, without the renunciation of life in the world. For such a fulfillment of the consciousness, the urge for perfection must not be confined to a few individuals. There must be \"a general spiritual awakening and aspiration in mankind\" as well as \"a dynamic re-creating of individual manhood in the spiritual type.\"<ref>Sri Aurobindo, ''The Human Cycle, The Ideal of Human Unity, War and Self-Determination'' (Pondicherry: Sri Aurobindo Ashram, 1997), p. 262.</ref> This would lead eventually to the emergence of a new type of being, the gnostic being, which \u201cwould be the hope of a more harmonious evolutionary order in terrestrial Nature\u201d.<ref>Sri Aurobindo, ''The Life Divine'' (Pondicherry: Sri Aurobindo Ashram, 2005), p. 1006.</ref>\n\n== Publications ==\nSri Aurobindo Ashram is the primary publisher of the works of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother. As of January 2015 it keeps some 200 publications in English in print, of which 78 are books by Sri Aurobindo, 44 books by the Mother, 27 compilations from their works, and 47 books by other authors. These books are printed at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram Press, which has been in operation since the 1940s. They are distributed by SABDA, the Ashram\u2019s book distribution service, which has been in operation since the 1950s. SABDA also carries books relating to Sri Aurobindo, the Mother, and their yoga brought out by other publishers, making the number of English books on their list more than 600. The Ashram also publishes books in 17 other European and Indian languages, for a total of more than 550 publications. SABDA carries these and other non-English titles: in all there are 1678 titles in 23 languages.\n\nThe photographs of Sri Aurobindo and The Mother are printed in house and is available from Ashram reception service. Sizes are available to suit table top to large wall frames.\n\n=== Collected works ===\nThe Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo are being issued in 37 volumes, of which 34 have been published. The Collected Works of the Mother have been issued in 17 volumes.\n\n=== Periodicals ===\nThe Ashram publishes a number of journals relating to the philosophy and yoga of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother. These are currently printed at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram Press, though several were earlier brought out in other cities. Some of Sri Aurobindo\u2019s works first appeared in these and other journals, among them ''[[The Advent (magazine)|The Advent]]'', a quarterly, which has recently ceased publication. The most important journals in English are:\n* ''[[Bulletin of Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education]]'' (English-French, formerly ''Bulletin of Physical Education''), quarterly, Pondicherry, since 1949\n* ''[[Mother India (journal)|Mother India]]'' (English), monthly, Pondicherry, since 1949\n\nThe Ashram press also prints several journals published by other organizations. These include:\n* ''[[All India Magazine]]'' (English and other languages), monthly, Pondicherry\n* ''[[Bartika]]'' (Bengali), quarterly, Calcutta, since 1942\n* ''[[Srinvantu]]'', quarterly, Calcutta, since 1956\n* ''[[World Union]]'' (English), monthly, Pondicherry\n\n== Governance ==\nDuring the early years of the community Sri Aurobindo and the Mother imposed very few rules on the ''sadhaks'', because they wished them to learn to direct their lives by looking for the divine guidance within. After 1926, written rules were circulated. The main rules were an absolute prohibition of alcohol, drugs, sex and politics.There were also a number of guidelines for the smooth functioning of the collective life of the community. These rules were collected in Rules and Regulations of Sri Aurobindo Ashram, copies of which are given to all members.\n\nThe Sri Aurobindo Ashram Trust was established in 1955 to administer the community and its assets. The trust board consists of five Trustees, the first of whom were chosen by the Mother herself. After her passing in 1973, the trustees have chosen replacements by consensus.\n\nThe main ashram departments are overseen by department heads who report to the Trustees.\n\nThe Ashram, a public charitable trust, is open to all. No distinctions of nationality, religion, caste, gender, or age are observed. Members come from every part of India and many foreign countries. A large number of devotees from Pondicherry and Tamil Nadu visit the Ashram every day, and support the activities of the Ashram in various ways.

The ashram grew out of a small community of disciples who had gathered around [[Sri Aurobindo]] after he retired from politics and settled in Pondicherry in 1910. On 24 November 1926, after a major spiritual realization, Sri Aurobindo withdrew from public view in order to continue his spiritual work. At this time he handed over the full responsibility for the inner and outer lives of the ''sadhaks'' (spiritual aspirants) and the ashram to his spiritual collaborator, \"the Mother\", earlier known as [[Mirra Alfassa]]. This date is therefore generally known as the founding-day of the ashram, though, as Sri Aurobindo himself wrote, it had \u201cless been created than grown around him as its centre.\u201d<ref>Sri Aurobindo, ''Autobiographical Notes and Other Writings of Historical Interest'' (Pondicherry: Sri Aurobindo Ashram, 2006), p. 9.</ref>\n\n== History ==\nLife in the community that preceded the ashram was informal. Sri Aurobindo spent most of his time in writing and meditation. The three or four young men who had followed him to Pondicherry in 1910 lived with him and looked after the household. Otherwise they were free to do as they wished. The Mother and French writer Paul Richard met Sri Aurobindo in 1914 and proposed that they bring out a monthly review; but after the outbreak of World War I, they were obliged to leave India, and Sri Aurobindo had to do almost all of the work on the review himself, helped a little by the young men who were living with him. In April 1920 the Mother returned to Pondicherry, and soon the community began to take the form of an ashram, more because the ''sadhaks'' \u201cdesired to entrust their whole inner and outer life to the Mother than from any intention or plan of hers or of Sri Aurobindo.\u201d<ref>''Autobiographical Notes'', p. 103.</ref> After the ashram was given formal shape in 1926, it experienced a period of rapid growth, increasing from around 24 in the beginning of 1927 to more than 150 in 1934.<ref>Sri Aurobindo, ''Letters on Himself and the Ashram'' (Pondicherry: Sri Aurobindo Ashram, 2011), p. 581.</ref> The membership leveled off in 1934 owing to a lack of suitable housing.\n\nDuring these years there was a regular routine. At 6:00 every morning the Mother appeared on the ashram balcony to initiate the day with her blessings. ''Sadhaks'' would have woken very early and completed a good portion of the day\u2019s work including meditation and then assembled under the balcony to receive her blessings.<ref>Karmayogi ''Life and Teachings of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother'', Mere Cie, Inc. [http://www.motherservice.org/Life%20&%20Teachings/Life%20and%20Teachings.htm online]</ref>\n\nAs the ashram grew, many departments came up and were looked after by the ''sadhaks'' as part of their ''sadhana'': the offices, library, dining room, book/photograph printing, workshops, sports/playground, art gallery, dispensary/nursing home, farms, dairies, flower gardens, guest houses, laundry, bakery, etc. The heads of the departments met the Mother in the morning and took her blessings and orders. She would meet the sadhaks individually again at 10 am and, in the evening at 5:30 pm, she would conduct meditation and meet the sadhaks.\n\nIn addition, four times a year Sri Aurobindo and the Mother used to give public [[Dar\u015bana|Darshan]]s (spiritual gatherings where the guru bestows blessings) to thousands of devotees gathered to receive grace.\n\n== Present ==\n[[File:Aurobindo Ashram Pondichery - Outside view.jpg|thumbnail|People waiting in a queue to get inside the ashram]]\nOnce confined to a few buildings in one corner of Pondicherry, the ashram\u2019s growth has caused it to expand physically in all directions. Today Ashramites live and work in more than 400 buildings spread throughout the town. The central focus of the community is one group of houses including those in which Sri Aurobindo and the Mother dwelt for most of their lives in Pondicherry. This interconnected block of houses \u2014 called \u201cthe Ashram main-building\u201d, or more usually just \u201cthe Ashram\u201d \u2014 surrounds a tree-shaded courtyard, at the centre of which lies the flower-covered \u201cSamadhi\u201d. This white marble shrine holds, in two separate chambers, the physical remains of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother.\n\nToday, Pondicherry has become an important destination for spiritual seekers as well as tourists. Thousands of visitors from all over the world come to the ashram.\n\nThe visiting hours for the visitors are from 8 am to 12 noon and then again from 2 pm to 6 pm.\n\n== Aims and ideals ==\nThe Ashram, according to Sri Aurobindo, \u201chas been created with another object than that ordinarily common to such institutions, not for the renunciation of the world but as a centre and a field of practice for the evolution of another kind and form of life which would in the final end be moved by a higher spiritual consciousness and embody a greater life of the spirit.\u201d<ref>''Letters on Himself and the Ashram'', p. 593.</ref>\n\nThe practice of Integral Yoga, Sri Aurobindo explained, \u201ddoes not proceed through any set mental teaching or prescribed forms of meditation, mantras or others, but by aspiration, by a self-concentration inwards or upwards, by self-opening to an Influence, to the Divine Power above us and its workings, to the Divine Presence in the heart, and by the rejection of all that is foreign to these things.\u201d<ref>Sri Aurobindo, ''Letters on Yoga \u2013 II'' (Pondicherry: Sri Aurobindo Ashram, 2013), p. 20.</ref>\n\n{{quotation|There are many things belonging to older systems that are necessary on the way \u2014 an opening of the mind to a greater wideness and to the sense of the Self and the Infinite, an emergence into what has been called the cosmic consciousness, mastery over the desires and passions; an outward asceticism is not essential, but the conquest of desire and attachment and a control over the body and its needs, greeds and instincts are indispensable. There is a combination of the principles of the old systems, the way of knowledge through the mind\u2019s discernment between Reality and the appearance, the heart\u2019s way of devotion, love and surrender and the way of works turning the will away from motives of self-interest to the Truth and the service of a greater Reality than the ego. For the whole being has to be trained so that it can respond and be transformed when it is possible for that greater Light and Force to work in the nature.|Sri Aurobindo<ref>''Autobiographical Notes'', p. 549.</ref>}}\n\nThe complete method of Integral Yoga aims to transform human life into a divine life. In Sri Aurobindo's yoga, the highest aim is the state of being one with the Divine, without the renunciation of life in the world. For such a fulfillment of the consciousness, the urge for perfection must not be confined to a few individuals. There must be \"a general spiritual awakening and aspiration in mankind\" as well as \"a dynamic re-creating of individual manhood in the spiritual type.\"<ref>Sri Aurobindo, ''The Human Cycle, The Ideal of Human Unity, War and Self-Determination'' (Pondicherry: Sri Aurobindo Ashram, 1997), p. 262.</ref> This would lead eventually to the emergence of a new type of being, the gnostic being, which \u201cwould be the hope of a more harmonious evolutionary order in terrestrial Nature\u201d.<ref>Sri Aurobindo, ''The Life Divine'' (Pondicherry: Sri Aurobindo Ashram, 2005), p. 1006.</ref>\n\n== Publications ==\nSri Aurobindo Ashram is the primary publisher of the works of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother. As of January 2015 it keeps some 200 publications in English in print, of which 78 are books by Sri Aurobindo, 44 books by the Mother, 27 compilations from their works, and 47 books by other authors. These books are printed at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram Press, which has been in operation since the 1940s. They are distributed by SABDA, the Ashram\u2019s book distribution service, which has been in operation since the 1950s. SABDA also carries books relating to Sri Aurobindo, the Mother, and their yoga brought out by other publishers, making the number of English books on their list more than 600. The Ashram also publishes books in 17 other European and Indian languages, for a total of more than 550 publications. SABDA carries these and other non-English titles: in all there are 1678 titles in 23 languages.\n\nThe photographs of Sri Aurobindo and The Mother are printed in house and is available from Ashram reception service. Sizes are available to suit table top to large wall frames.\n\n=== Collected works ===\nThe Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo are being issued in 37 volumes, of which 34 have been published. The Collected Works of the Mother have been issued in 17 volumes.\n\n=== Periodicals ===\nThe Ashram publishes a number of journals relating to the philosophy and yoga of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother. These are currently printed at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram Press, though several were earlier brought out in other cities. Some of Sri Aurobindo\u2019s works first appeared in these and other journals, among them ''[[The Advent (magazine)|The Advent]]'', a quarterly, which has recently ceased publication. The most important journals in English are:\n* ''[[Bulletin of Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education]]'' (English-French, formerly ''Bulletin of Physical Education''), quarterly, Pondicherry, since 1949\n* ''[[Mother India (journal)|Mother India]]'' (English), monthly, Pondicherry, since 1949\n\nThe Ashram press also prints several journals published by other organizations. These include:\n* ''[[All India Magazine]]'' (English and other languages), monthly, Pondicherry\n* ''[[Bartika]]'' (Bengali), quarterly, Calcutta, since 1942\n* ''[[Srinvantu]]'', quarterly, Calcutta, since 1956\n* ''[[World Union]]'' (English), monthly, Pondicherry\n\n== Governance ==\nDuring the early years of the community Sri Aurobindo and the Mother imposed very few rules on the ''sadhaks'', because they wished them to learn to direct their lives by looking for the divine guidance within. After 1926, written rules were circulated. The main rules were an absolute prohibition of alcohol, drugs, sex and politics.There were also a number of guidelines for the smooth functioning of the collective life of the community. These rules were collected in Rules and Regulations of Sri Aurobindo Ashram, copies of which are given to all members.\n\nThe Sri Aurobindo Ashram Trust was established in 1955 to administer the community and its assets. The trust board consists of five Trustees, the first of whom were chosen by the Mother herself. After her passing in 1973, the trustees have chosen replacements by consensus.\n\nThe main ashram departments are overseen by department heads who report to the Trustees.\n\nThe Ashram, a public charitable trust, is open to all. No distinctions of nationality, religion, caste, gender, or age are observed. Members come from every part of India and many foreign countries. A large number of devotees from Pondicherry and Tamil Nadu visit the Ashram every day, and support the activities of the Ashram in various ways. Many say that they have benefited from the teachings of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother.<ref>{{cite news|title=Momentous arrivals in Puducherry and the calm celebrations|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/momentous-arrivals-in-puducherry-and-the-calm-celebrations/article7070189.ece|accessdate=7 April 2015|publisher=The Hindu}}</ref> However, some feel that there is little mingling of ashramites and local people.

It was the first [[Band III|high-band]] VHF television station (channels 7-13) in the United States. A few months later, the station changed its call letters to '''WMAL-TV''' after its radio sisters. WMAL radio had been an affiliate of the [[NBC Blue Network]] since 1933, and remained with the network after it was spun off by NBC and evolved into ABC. However, channel 7 started as a [[CBS]] station since ABC had not yet established its television network. When ABC launched on television in 1948, WMAL-TV became ABC's third primary affiliate; the station continued to carry some CBS programming until WOIC (channel 9, now [[WUSA (TV)|WUSA]]) signed on in 1949.

In 1984, it saw a minor update with rounded ends on the \"7\" being modified to use sharp, straight edges, like the logo later used by [[Australia]]'s [[Seven Network]]. This version of the logo was probably the longest continuously used numeric logo in Washington's television history. The only real modification came in 1998, after it began calling itself \"ABC 7\" on-air and added the ABC logo to the left side. In 2001, WJLA-TV adopted the standard version of the \"Circle 7\" logo, refueling speculation that ABC would purchase the station, a deal that would never come to pass.

The station has the largest news team in the Washington area, which includes around 40 on-air staff members. As the flagship station of the Allbritton Communications station group, WJLA-TV provided all news reports for the Allbritton station group via its news-gathering service.\n\nPrior to 2001, WJLA-TV's newscasts had long placed third in the market's news ratings, behind WUSA and NBC-owned [[WRC-TV]]. The station hired [[Maureen Bunyan]], former longtime anchor at WUSA, and in 2003, former [[CNN]] anchor [[Leon Harris]] joined the station as an anchor. In 2004, WJLA-TV hired Bunyan's former anchor desk partner, [[Gordon Peterson (journalist)|Gordon Peterson]]; and reunited the two as anchors for the 6:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast. These personnel moves, combined with WUSA's recent ratings troubles, led to a resurgence in the ratings. In the May 2010 sweeps, it placed number one at 5:00&nbsp;p.m. in total viewers, and in the 25\u201354 demo.\n\nWJLA-TV became the second television station in the Washington, D.C. market (behind WUSA) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in [[high-definition television|high definition]] on December 8, 2008. The upgrade included the introduction of a new on-air graphics package as well as minor changes made to the news desk for better viewing quality with high definition. Field reports and [[Promo (media)|promotions]] for WJLA-TV's newscasts continued to be broadcast in [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] until the end of March 2013, when the station upgraded to HD field cameras for field shots and some news promotions.\n\nOn January 23, 2009, WJLA-TV [[layoff|laid off]] 26 staff members, including several on-air reporters, due to financial constraints. The laid off reporters included Andrea McCarren, [[Sarah Lee (reporter)|Sarah C. Lee]], Alisa Parenti, Emily Schmidt, Jennefer Donelan, and weekend sports anchor Greg Toland. Most of the dismissals took effect immediately, but some were allowed to serve out their contracts. WJLA-TV also announced a 4.9% salary cut for all remaining staff and a halt to company contributions to 401(k) retirement plans.<ref>{{cite news |title=Citing Economy, WJLA Fires 26 Staffers|first=Neely|last=Tucker|work=Washington Post|date=Jan 24, 2009|page=C1}}</ref>\n\nPost-acquisition, concerns began to emerge surrounding how Sinclair's historic [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] slant may affect WJLA-TV's news coverage. After Sinclair took over the station, WJLA-TV began to air conservative commentaries by Sinclair executive [[Mark E. Hyman]], along with stories from Sinclair's Washington bureau\u2014all of which were critical of the [[Obama administration]]. The station also partnered with the conservative ''[[Washington Times]]'' to feature its weekly \"Golden Hammer\" award\u2014highlighting \"the most egregious examples of government waste, fraud and abuse\", as a segment during its newscasts. WJLA-TV staff members felt that it was inappropriate for a station in Washington, D.C. to air stories that are critical of the federal government; one employee told ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that with these changes, the station may \"lose the trust they built up with people over years and years.

The station is owned by the [[Hunt Valley, Maryland|Hunt Valley]], [[Maryland]]-based [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]], which also operates local [[cable television|cable]] channel [[WJLA 24/7 News]]. The two outlets share studios on Wilson Boulevard in the [[Rosslyn, Virginia|Rosslyn]] section of [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]], [[Virginia]] (at the former headquarters of the [[Gannett|Gannett Company]] and its flagship newspaper ''[[USA Today]]''); WJLA-TV's transmitter is located in the [[Tenleytown]] neighborhood of [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|northwest Washington]].\n\nOn cable, the station is available on [[Xfinity|Comcast Xfinity]] channel 27 in Washington, D.C.

It was the first [[Band III|high-band]] VHF television station (channels 7-13) in the United States. A few months later, the station changed its call letters to '''WMAL-TV''' after its radio sisters. WMAL radio had been an affiliate of the [[NBC Blue Network]] since 1933, and remained with the network after it was spun off by NBC and evolved into ABC. However, channel 7 started as a [[CBS]] station since ABC had not yet established its television network. When ABC launched on television in 1948, WMAL-TV became ABC's third primary affiliate; the station continued to carry some CBS programming until WOIC (channel 9, now [[WUSA (TV)|WUSA]]) signed on in 1949. During the late 1950s, the station was also briefly affiliated with the [[NTA Film Network]].<ref name=\"Boxoffice7\">{{Cite journal|title=Require Prime Evening Time for NTA Films |journal=Boxoffice |page=13 |date=November 10, 1956 |url=http://issuu.com/boxoffice/docs/boxoffice_111056-1 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614204506/http://issuu.com:80/boxoffice/docs/boxoffice_111056-1 |archivedate=June 14, 2009 }}</ref> (''Note'': The [[WTVW]] call letters were later picked up by what is now [[WISN-TV]], the ABC affiliate in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], when it signed on in 1954.

From 1970 to 2001, WMAL-TV/WJLA-TV used its own version of the logo, with the \"7\" modified to accommodate the circle. In 1984, it saw a minor update with rounded ends on the \"7\" being modified to use sharp, straight edges, like the logo later used by [[Australia]]'s [[Seven Network]]. This version of the logo was probably the longest continuously used numeric logo in Washington's television history. The only real modification came in 1998, after it began calling itself \"ABC 7\" on-air and added the ABC logo to the left side. In 2001, WJLA-TV adopted the standard version of the \"Circle 7\" logo, refueling speculation that ABC would purchase the station, a deal that would never come to pass.

As the flagship station of the Allbritton Communications station group, WJLA-TV provided all news reports for the Allbritton station group via its news-gathering service.\n\nPrior to 2001, WJLA-TV's newscasts had long placed third in the market's news ratings, behind WUSA and NBC-owned [[WRC-TV]]. The station hired [[Maureen Bunyan]], former longtime anchor at WUSA, and in 2003, former [[CNN]] anchor [[Leon Harris]] joined the station as an anchor. In 2004, WJLA-TV hired Bunyan's former anchor desk partner, [[Gordon Peterson (journalist)|Gordon Peterson]]; and reunited the two as anchors for the 6:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast. These personnel moves, combined with WUSA's recent ratings troubles, led to a resurgence in the ratings. In the May 2010 sweeps, it placed number one at 5:00&nbsp;p.m. in total viewers, and in the 25\u201354 demo.\n\nWJLA-TV became the second television station in the Washington, D.C. market (behind WUSA) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in [[high-definition television|high definition]] on December 8, 2008. The upgrade included the introduction of a new on-air graphics package as well as minor changes made to the news desk for better viewing quality with high definition. Field reports and [[Promo (media)|promotions]] for WJLA-TV's newscasts continued to be broadcast in [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] until the end of March 2013, when the station upgraded to HD field cameras for field shots and some news promotions.\n\nOn January 23, 2009, WJLA-TV [[layoff|laid off]] 26 staff members, including several on-air reporters, due to financial constraints. The laid off reporters included Andrea McCarren, [[Sarah Lee (reporter)|Sarah C. Lee]], Alisa Parenti, Emily Schmidt, Jennefer Donelan, and weekend sports anchor Greg Toland. Most of the dismissals took effect immediately, but some were allowed to serve out their contracts.

The station also partnered with the conservative ''[[Washington Times]]'' to feature its weekly \"Golden Hammer\" award\u2014highlighting \"the most egregious examples of government waste, fraud and abuse\", as a segment during its newscasts. WJLA-TV staff members felt that it was inappropriate for a station in Washington, D.C. to air stories that are critical of the federal government; one employee told ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that with these changes, the station may \"lose the trust they built up with people over years and years.

The formation shows tides to the early Mesozoic Central Atlas rift, composed of  [[Paleozoic]] rocks which provided the majority of the clasts present on the layers. A mostly marine margin recovers transgressions present on the Middle Toarcian on the basin, with accumulation of limestone with [[Lamellibranchia]]ns, that extends to the limit with the lowersmost [[Aalenian]], along diverse sectors inside the Atlas Domain.

The tectonic processes on the high Atlas proabaly lead to most of the Volcanic manifestations locally.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/> \n\n===Stratigraphy===\nThe formation is subdivided on several stratigraphic levels, starting with the so called  facies of term A, composed by  [[Gypsum]] and [[Salt]], from Triassic age, supported by the presence of Volcanic Intercalations of basalt.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain0 /><ref name=Allain1 /><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Above that, there are carbonates of term B alternated at the first with [[Dolomite (rock)|Dolomite]]s, [[Pelite]]s and [[Limestone]]s along with Marly-[[Silt]] crimes with plant debris, which had regular influence  of a marine environment.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> That is proved by the presence of [[Ooid]]s, [[Oncolith]]s, debris of [[Mollusc]]s and benthic [[Foraminifer]]s, being dissolved and recrystallized as [[Sparite]].<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The third level shows a transition between marine and continental deposits, through carbonate palustrine levels and [[Caliche]] horizons, being continental layers superimposed in stratigraphic continuity over the marine carbonates of the lower Lias ([[Sinemurian]]-[[Hettangian]]).<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Those continental layers are rich in [[Coarse structure|Coarse]] Volcano-detrital episodes as result of a sedimentary  process of  high sedimentation rates, where the strata,  including the deposit with Dinosaur fossils, where deposited on a short time interval, where Middle Jurassic [[Bajocian]]-[[Bathonian]] carbonate levels, frequent within the Atlas domain, do not exist not in Toundoute.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The sedimentation on the Toundoute member have some characteristics, such as  lenticular channels with [[Sieve]]-[[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]] of ~5 m thick (\u2264 5m) for visible decametric, composed of several materials, like  Volcanic products, as  blocks of volcanic rocks such as sands made of [[Feldspar]]s, black ferruginous grains from the surface of volcanic rocks on dry periods, siliceous green fragments from post eruption processes  ([[Vein (geology)|Vein]]s, [[Microgeode]]s, [[Nippled Concretions]]), [[Limestone]] debris with traces of roots and cracks, where in some parts traces dark fine bushy algae filaments are still visible, similar to te genus [[Girvanella]] blue-green algae.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Other materials include [[Schist]] and Vein [[Quartz]], witouth bone and wood debris with a good cellular structure.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The [[Floodplain]]-like deposits are divided in two parts, with hard [[Limestone]] nodules, pink or brick and very irregular, typical of profiles of [[Calcimorph Soils]] formed on climates with pronounced dry phases. Those nodules had a visible reorganization in the channels, as a result of erosion of the alluvial plain by the fluvial network.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain0 /> Finally there are present interlays of fine sandstone often laminated that mark the [[Flood]] facies from channels in period of flood, being composed only by plagioclase [[Feldspar]]s and in a lesser proportion of [[Orthoclase]]s, along  with small ferruginous grains or fine silts of [[Quartz]].<ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 />\nThere is documentation of warm climatic conditions locally, that alternating wet and dry periods, as is seen on the other formations gave rise to soils with differentiated limestone profiles, such as [[Pedogenetic Nodules]] or [[Caliche]].<ref name=\"Montenat\"/> The accumulation in the channels from calcimorphic soil profiles shows the presence of an active erosion on soils with probably sparse vegetation.<ref name=\"Ettaki, M. 2000\"/><ref name=Allain0 /><ref name=Allain1 /> \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Stratigraphy of the Toundoute Continental Series\n!Unit \n!Lithology\n!Thickness (metres)\n!Dinosaur fossils\n|-\n|[[Alluvium]]\n|Holocene conglomerate\n|\n|\n|-\n|H\n|Clay-sandstone series\n|\u2265 100 \n|\n|-\n|G\n|Clay-sandstone series, with gypsum layer present at the top, just below this a second dinosaur bearing horizon is present with very similar lithology to unit F.\n|50 \n|''[[Tazoudasaurus]], [[Berberosaurus]]''<ref name=\"Taquet4\"/>\n|-\n|F\n|Greenish grey clay-marl, detrital gravel to pebble sized clasts with lignite and bones.\n|\u2264 5 \n|Present, indeterminate\n|-\n|E\n|Alternation of red brown clay, fine sandstone and sandstone coarse conglomerates\n|100 \n|\n|-\n|D\n|Clay, fine sandstone and conglomerate, large volcanic rocks present.<ref>Ellero, A., Ottria, G., Malus\u00e0, M.

The predominantly terrigenous deposits of this formation suggest they were  deposited in continental setting, influenced by at least 6 different river channels, that trace it's path to the Atlas Gulf. On the [[Toarcian]]-[[Aalenian]] transgression, the High Atlas domain experienced a long process of extension and rifting, recorded by the presence of marine carbonates and shales, found on the Wazzant Formation Beds. It is related to the formation of the [[Atlantic Rifting]] to the west and of the formation of the [[Tethys]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} to the north.<ref>El Harfi, A., Guiraud, M., & Lang, J. (2006).

{"title_page": "Shinto origins of sumo", "text_new": "[[File:Nomisukune14.JPG|thumb|upright|God of sumo, [[Nomi no Sukune]]]]\n'''The Shinto origins of sumo''' can easily be traced back through the centuries and many current [[sumo]] rituals are directly handed down from Shinto rituals. The [[Shinto]] religion has historically been used as a means to express Japanese nationalism and ethnic identity, especially prior to the end of [[World War II]]. In its association with Shinto, sumo has also been seen as a bulwark of Japanese tradition.<ref name=\"reader\">{{cite journal|last = Reader |first = Ian |date=December 1989 |title = Sumo: The Recent History of an Ethical Model for Japanese Society |journal=International Journal of the History of Sport |volume=6 |issue=3 |doi=10.1080/09523368908713700 |pages=285\u2013298}}</ref>\n\nSumo can be traced back to ancient Shinto rituals to ensure a bountiful harvest and honor the spirits known as [[kami]]. In modern times, the canopy over the sumo ring, called the [[dohy\u014d]] is reminiscent of a Shinto shrine, the officiator is dressed in garb very similar to that of a Shinto priest, and the throwing of salt before a bout is believed to purify the ring.<ref>{{cite newspaper|last = Kamiya|first = Setsuko|year = 2010| title = Steeped in tradition, Shinto, sumo is also scandal-stained|newspaper = Japan Times}}</ref>\n\nPrior to becoming a professional sport in the Tokugawa period, sumo was originally performed on the grounds of a shrine or temple. The present ''dohy\u014d'', which is still considered sacred, is in honor of the days when matches were held on the sacred grounds of shrines and temples. The roof over the ''dohy\u014d'' called ''yakata'' originally represented the sky for the purpose of emphasizing the sacred nature of ''dohy\u014d'', which symbolizes the earth. On the day before the beginning of each tournament, the ''dohy\u014d-matsuri'', a ring-blessing ceremony, is performed by sumo officials called [[gy\u014dji]]. They are the referees on the ''dohy\u014d'', who judge each sumo match. Their elaborate, colorful costumes are based on ceremonial court robes of the [[Heian period]] (AD 794 \u2013 1185). Also their black hats are exact copies of the hats worn by Shinto priests depicted in various Heian art. Dressed in the white robes of a Shinto priest ''gy\u014dji'' purify and bless the ''dohy\u014d'' in a solemn ceremony during which salt, kelp, dried squid and chestnuts are buried in the center of the ''dohy\u014d''.

The [[Shinto]] religion has historically been used as a means to express Japanese nationalism and ethnic identity, especially prior to the end of [[World War II]]. In its association with Shinto, sumo has also been seen as a bulwark of Japanese tradition.<ref name=\"reader\">{{cite journal|last = Reader |first = Ian |date=December 1989 |title = Sumo: The Recent History of an Ethical Model for Japanese Society |journal=International Journal of the History of Sport |volume=6 |issue=3 |doi=10.1080/09523368908713700 |pages=285\u2013298}}</ref>\n\nSumo can be traced back to ancient Shinto rituals to ensure a bountiful harvest and honor the spirits known as [[kami]]. In modern times, the canopy over the sumo ring, called the [[dohy\u014d]] is reminiscent of a Shinto shrine, the officiator is dressed in garb very similar to that of a Shinto priest, and the throwing of salt before a bout is believed to purify the ring.<ref>{{cite newspaper|last = Kamiya|first = Setsuko|year = 2010| title = Steeped in tradition, Shinto, sumo is also scandal-stained|newspaper = Japan Times}}</ref>\n\nPrior to becoming a professional sport in the Tokugawa period, sumo was originally performed on the grounds of a shrine or temple. The present ''dohy\u014d'', which is still considered sacred, is in honor of the days when matches were held on the sacred grounds of shrines and temples. The roof over the ''dohy\u014d'' called ''yakata'' originally represented the sky for the purpose of emphasizing the sacred nature of ''dohy\u014d'', which symbolizes the earth. On the day before the beginning of each tournament, the ''dohy\u014d-matsuri'', a ring-blessing ceremony, is performed by sumo officials called ''gy\u014dji''. They are the referees on the ''dohy\u014d'', who judge each sumo match. Their elaborate, colorful costumes are based on ceremonial court robes of the [[Heian period]] (AD 794 \u2013 1185). Also their black hats are exact copies of the hats worn by Shinto priests depicted in various Heian art. Dressed in the white robes of a Shinto priest ''gy\u014dji'' purify and bless the ''dohy\u014d'' in a solemn ceremony during which salt, kelp, dried squid and chestnuts are buried in the center of the ''dohy\u014d''. Observing officials and invited guests drink sake, Japanese traditional alcoholic drink as it is offered to each one in turn.
