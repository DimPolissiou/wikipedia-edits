Several months earlier, the first mission to the Salyut, [[Soyuz 10]], had failed to successfully dock with the station.<ref name=\"ten\">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,902953,00.html|title=A Troubled Salyut|accessdate=20 October 2007|work=Time Magazine|author=Time Magazine | date=10 May 1971}}</ref> Soyuz 11 successfully docked with Salyut 1 on 7 June and the cosmonauts remained on board for 22 days, setting space endurance records that would hold until the American [[Skylab 2]] mission in May\u2013June 1973.<ref name=\"time\" />\n\nUpon first entering the station, the crew encountered a smoky and burnt atmosphere and after replacing part of the ventilation system spent the next day back in their Soyuz until the air cleared. Their stay in Salyut was productive, including live television broadcasts. A fire broke out on day 11 of their stay, causing mission planners to consider abandoning the station. The planned highlight of the mission was to have been the observation of an [[N1 (rocket)|N1]] rocket launch, but the launch was postponed. The crew also found that using the exercise treadmill as they were required to twice a day caused the whole station to vibrate. ''[[Pravda]]'' released news of the mission and regular updates while it was in progress.\n\n==Death of crew==\n{{refimprove|section|date=June 2017}}\nOn 30 June 1971 (Moscow time), after an apparently normal [[atmospheric entry|reentry]] of the capsule of the Soyuz 11 mission, the recovery team opened the capsule to find the crew dead.<ref name=\"time\" /><ref name=\"nssdc\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-4209/ch5-6.htm|title=Soyuz 11: Triumph and Tragedy|accessdate=19 June 2013|publisher=NASA -[[National Space Science Data Center]]|year=2007|author=[[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA)}}</ref><ref name=\"usatoday\">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-02-01-accident-timeline_x.htm|title=Deadly accidents in the history of space exploration|accessdate=20 October 2007|work=USA Today|author=USA Today | date=1 February 2003}}</ref>\n\nKerim Kerimov, chair of the State Commission, recalled: \"Outwardly, there was no damage whatsoever.

Flight recorder data from the single cosmonaut outfitted with biomedical sensors showed cardiac arrest occurred within 40 seconds of pressure loss. By 15 minutes, 35 seconds after retrofire, the cabin pressure was zero, and remained there until the capsule entered the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]].<ref name=\"part\" /> Patsayev's body was found positioned near the valve, and he may have been attempting to close or block the valve at the time he lost consciousness.\n\nAn extensive investigation was conducted to study all components and systems of Soyuz 11 that could have caused the accident, although doctors quickly concluded that the cosmonauts had died of asphyxiation. Examination of the descent module showed that it was in excellent condition and there was no damage to it in the forms of cracks or ruptures of the hull.\n\nThe autopsies took place at Burdenko Military Hospital and found that the cause of death proper for the cosmonauts was [[Bleeding|hemorrhaging]] of the blood vessels in the brain, with lesser amounts of bleeding under their skin, in the inner ear, and in the nasal cavity, all of which occurred as exposure to a vacuum environment caused the oxygen and nitrogen in their bloodstreams to bubble and rupture vessels. Their blood was also found to contain heavy concentrations of [[lactic acid]], a sign of extreme physiologic stress. Although they could have remained conscious for almost a minute after decompression began, less than 20 seconds would have passed before the effects of oxygen starvation made it impossible for them to function.\n\nAlexei Leonov, who would have originally commanded Soyuz 11, had advised the cosmonauts before the flight that they should manually close the valves between the orbital and descent modules as he did not trust them to shut automatically, a procedure he thought up during extensive time in the Soyuz simulator. However, Dobrovolsky, Volkov, and Patsayev either chose to disregard his warnings or else forgot about them during the lengthy mission. After the flight, Leonov went back and tried closing one of the valves himself and found that it took nearly a minute to do, too long in an emergency situation with the spacecraft's atmosphere escaping fast.<ref name=\"Space Safety magazine\"/>\n\nThe Soviet state media attempted to downplay the tragic end of the mission and instead emphasized its accomplishments during the crew's stay aboard Salyut 1. Since they did not publicly announce the exact cause of the cosmonauts' deaths for almost two years afterwards, US space planners were extremely worried about the upcoming Skylab program as they could not be certain whether prolonged time in a micro-g environment had turned out to be fatal. However, NASA doctor Charles Berry maintained a firm conviction that the cosmonauts could not have died from spending too many weeks in weightlessness. Until the Soviets finally disclosed what had really happened, Dr. Berry theorized that the crew had died from inhaling toxic substances.\n\nA film that was later declassified showed support crews attempting [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] on the cosmonauts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Soyuz 11 CPR|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdhwbvKMe3I|website=Youtube|accessdate=30 December 2014}}</ref><ref>This footage was shown during the 1994 TV adaptation of the documentary ''[[Moon Shot]]'' by [[Alan Shepard]] and [[Deke Slayton]].</ref> It was not known until an [[autopsy]] that they had died because of a capsule depressurisation.

It will, I am sure, prove to have contributed greatly to the further achievements of the Soviet program for the exploration of space and thus to the widening of man's horizons.}}\n\nThe [[Soyuz program|Soyuz]] [[spacecraft]] was extensively redesigned after this incident to carry only two cosmonauts. The extra room meant that the crew could wear [[Sokol space suit]]s during launch and landing. The Sokol was a lightweight pressure suit intended for emergency use; updated versions of the suit remain in use to the present day. A Soyuz capsule would not hold three crew members again until the [[Soyuz-T]] redesign in 1980, which freed enough space for three people in lightweight pressure suits to travel in the capsule.\n\n==Memorials==\n\nThe Soyuz 11 landing coordinates are {{Coord|47.35663|N|70.12142|E}} which is 90&nbsp;km southwest of [[Karazhal]], [[Karagandy]], [[Kazakhstan]] and about 550&nbsp;km northeast of [[Baikonur]]. At the site was placed a memorial monument in the form of a three-sided metallic column, with the engraved image of the face of each crew member set into a stylized triangle on each of the three sides near the top.

A medical [[X-ray]] examination four days before launch suggested that Kubasov might have [[tuberculosis]], and according to the mission rules, the prime crew was replaced with the backup crew. For Dobrovolski and Patsayev, this was to be their first space mission. After the failure of [[Salyut 2]] to orbit, Kubasov and Leonov were reassigned to [[Soyuz 19]] for the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]] in 1975.\n\n==Mission highlights==\n\nThe [[Soyuz program|Soyuz]] [[Soyuz 7K-OKS|7K-OKS]] spacecraft was launched on 6 June 1971, from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in central [[Kazakh SSR]]. Several months earlier, the first mission to the Salyut, [[Soyuz 10]], had failed to successfully dock with the station.<ref name=\"ten\">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,902953,00.html|title=A Troubled Salyut|accessdate=20 October 2007|work=Time Magazine|author=Time Magazine | date=10 May 1971}}</ref> Soyuz 11 successfully docked with Salyut 1 on 7 June and the cosmonauts remained on board for 22 days, setting space endurance records that would hold until the American [[Skylab 2]] mission in May\u2013June 1973.<ref name=\"time\" />\n\nUpon first entering the station, the crew encountered a smoky and burnt atmosphere and after replacing part of the ventilation system spent the next day back in their Soyuz until the air cleared. Their stay in Salyut was productive, including live television broadcasts. A fire broke out on day 11 of their stay, causing mission planners to consider abandoning the station. The planned highlight of the mission was to have been the observation of an [[N1 (rocket)|N1]] rocket launch, but the launch was postponed. The crew also found that using the exercise treadmill as they were required to twice a day caused the whole station to vibrate. ''[[Pravda]]'' released news of the mission and regular updates while it was in progress.\n\n==Death of crew==\n{{refimprove|section|date=June 2017}}\nOn 30 June 1971 (Moscow time), after an apparently normal [[atmospheric entry|reentry]] of the capsule of the Soyuz 11 mission, the recovery team opened the capsule to find the crew dead.<ref name=\"time\" /><ref name=\"nssdc\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-4209/ch5-6.htm|title=Soyuz 11: Triumph and Tragedy|accessdate=19 June 2013|publisher=NASA -[[National Space Science Data Center]]|year=2007|author=[[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA)}}</ref><ref name=\"usatoday\">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-02-01-accident-timeline_x.htm|title=Deadly accidents in the history of space exploration|accessdate=20 October 2007|work=USA Today|author=USA Today | date=1 February 2003}}</ref>\n\nKerim Kerimov, chair of the State Commission, recalled: \"Outwardly, there was no damage whatsoever.

Flight recorder data from the single cosmonaut outfitted with biomedical sensors showed cardiac arrest occurred within 40 seconds of pressure loss. By 15 minutes, 35 seconds after retrofire, the cabin pressure was zero, and remained there until the capsule entered the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]].<ref name=\"part\" /> Patsayev's body was found positioned near the valve, and he may have been attempting to close or block the valve at the time he lost consciousness.\n\nAn extensive investigation was conducted to study all components and systems of Soyuz 11 that could have caused the accident, although doctors quickly concluded that the cosmonauts had died of asphyxiation. Examination of the descent module showed that it was in excellent condition and there was no damage to it in the forms of cracks or ruptures of the hull.\n\nThe autopsies took place at Burdenko Military Hospital and found that the cause of death proper for the cosmonauts was [[Bleeding|hemorrhaging]] of the blood vessels in the brain, with lesser amounts of bleeding under their skin, in the inner ear, and in the nasal cavity, all of which occurred as exposure to a vacuum environment caused the oxygen and nitrogen in their bloodstreams to bubble and rupture vessels. Their blood was also found to contain heavy concentrations of [[lactic acid]], a sign of extreme physiologic stress. Although they could have remained conscious for almost a minute after decompression began, less than 20 seconds would have passed before the effects of oxygen starvation made it impossible for them to function.\n\nAlexei Leonov, who would have originally commanded Soyuz 11, had advised the cosmonauts before the flight that they should manually close the valves between the orbital and descent modules as he did not trust them to shut automatically, a procedure he thought up during extensive time in the Soyuz simulator. However, Dobrovolsky, Volkov, and Patsayev either chose to disregard his warnings or else forgot about them during the lengthy mission. After the flight, Leonov went back and tried closing one of the valves himself and found that it took nearly a minute to do, too long in an emergency situation with the spacecraft's atmosphere escaping fast.<ref name=\"Space Safety magazine\"/>\n\nThe Soviet state media attempted to downplay the tragic end of the mission and instead emphasized its accomplishments during the crew's stay aboard Salyut 1. Since they did not publicly announce the exact cause of the cosmonauts' deaths for almost two years afterwards, US space planners were extremely worried about the upcoming Skylab program as they could not be certain whether prolonged time in zero gravity had turned out to be fatal. However, NASA doctor Charles Berry maintained a firm conviction that the cosmonauts could not have died from spending too many weeks in microgravity. Until the Soviets finally disclosed what had really happened, Dr. Berry theorized that the crew had died from inhaling toxic substances.\n\nA film that was later declassified showed support crews attempting [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] on the cosmonauts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Soyuz 11 CPR|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdhwbvKMe3I|website=Youtube|accessdate=30 December 2014}}</ref><ref>This footage was shown during the 1994 TV adaptation of the documentary ''[[Moon Shot]]'' by [[Alan Shepard]] and [[Deke Slayton]].</ref> It was not known until an [[autopsy]] that they had died because of a capsule depressurisation.

It will, I am sure, prove to have contributed greatly to the further achievements of the Soviet program for the exploration of space and thus to the widening of man's horizons.}}\n\nThe [[Soyuz program|Soyuz]] [[spacecraft]] was extensively redesigned after this incident to carry only two cosmonauts. The extra room meant that the crew could wear [[Sokol space suit]]s during launch and landing. The Sokol was a lightweight pressure suit intended for emergency use; updated versions of the suit remain in use to the present day. A Soyuz capsule would not hold three crew members again until the [[Soyuz-T]] redesign in 1980, which freed enough space for three people in lightweight pressure suits to travel in the capsule.\n\n==Memorials==\n\nThe Soyuz 11 landing coordinates are {{Coord|47.35663|N|70.12142|E}} which is 90&nbsp;km southwest of [[Karazhal]], [[Karagandy]], [[Kazakhstan]] and about 550&nbsp;km northeast of [[Baikonur]]. At the site was placed a memorial monument in the form of a three-sided metallic column, with the engraved image of the face of each crew member set into a stylized triangle on each of the three sides near the top.

For example, a Fire Weather Forecast, which have a forecast period covering up to seven days, is issued by local WFOs daily, with updates as needed. The forecasts contain weather information relevant to fire control and smoke management for the next 12 to 48 hours, such as wind direction and speed, and precipitation. The appropriate crews use this information to plan for staffing and equipment levels, the ability to conduct scheduled controlled burns, and assess the daily fire danger. Once per day, NWS meteorologists issue a coded fire weather forecast for specific [[United States Forest Service]] observation sites that are then input into the [[National Fire Danger Rating System]] (NFDRS). This computer model outputs the daily fire danger that is then conveyed to the public in one of five ratings: low, moderate, high, very high, or extreme.<ref name=\"nfdrs\">{{cite web|title=National Fire Danger Rating System|url=http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/sew/fire/olm/nfdrs.htm|website=NWS Western Region Headquarters|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration}}</ref>\n\nThe local Weather Forecast Offices of the NWS also, under a prescribed set of criteria, issue Fire Weather Watches and [[Red Flag Warning]]s as needed, in addition to issuing the daily fire weather forecasts for the local service area. These products alert the public and other agencies to conditions which create the potential for extreme fires. On the national level, the NWS [[Storm Prediction Center]] issues fire weather analyses for days one and two of the forecast period that provide supportive information to the local WFO forecasts regarding particular critical elements of fire weather conditions. These include large-scale areas that may experience critical fire weather conditions including the occurrence of \"dry thunderstorms,\" which usually occur in the [[Western United States|western U.S.]], and are not accompanied by any rain due to it [[virga|evaporating before reaching the surface]].<ref name=\"spcfire\">{{cite web|title=SPC and its Products|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/misc/about.html#FireWx |website=Storm Prediction Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=February 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:NWS-IMET-deployed.jpg|right|150px|thumb|NWS IMET Chris Gibson taking observations in the field.]]\n\nState and federal forestry officials sometimes request a forecast from a WFO for a specific location called a \"spot forecast,\" which are used to determine whether it will be safe to ignite a [[prescribed burn]] and how to situate crews during the controlling phase. Officials send in a request, usually during the early morning, containing the position coordinates of the proposed burn, the ignition time, and other pertinent information. The WFO composes a short-term fire weather forecast for the location and sends it back to the officials, usually within an hour of receiving the request.<ref name=\"spcfire\" />\n\nThe NWS assists officials at the scene of large wildfires or other disasters, including [[HAZMAT]] incidents, by providing on-site support through Incident Meteorologists (IMET).<ref name=\"flagstaffincident\">{{cite web|title=NWS Flagstaff|url=http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/fgz/office/imetpage.php?wfo=fgz |website=NWS Western Region Headquarters|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=February 22, 2013}}</ref> IMETs are NWS forecasters specially trained to work with Incident Management Teams during severe wildfire outbreaks or other disasters requiring on-site weather support.

Each WFO maintains a specific area of responsibility spanning multiple counties, parishes or other jurisdictions within the [[Continental United States]] \u2013 which, in some areas, cover multiple states \u2013 or individual possessions; the local offices handle responsibility of composing and disseminating forecasts and weather alerts to areas within their region of service. Some of the products that are only issued by the WFOs are [[severe thunderstorm warning|severe thunderstorm]] and [[Tornado Warning|tornado]] warnings, flood, [[flash flood warning|flash flood]], and winter weather watches and warnings, some aviation products, and local forecast grids. The forecasts issued by a WFO are available on their individual pages within the Weather.gov website, which can be accessed through either forecast landing pages (which identify the office that disseminates the weather data) or via the alert map featured on the main page of the National Weather Service website.\n{{clear left}}\n\n===National Centers for Environmental Prediction===\n{{main|National Centers for Environmental Prediction}}\n\n====Aviation====\n[[Image:Wea01302 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|Meteorologists preparing a forecast, early 20th century.]]\n\nThe NWS supports the aviation community through the production of several forecasts.

As opposed to a public weather forecast, a TAF only addresses weather elements critical to aviation; these include wind, [[visibility]], [[cloud|cloud cover]] and [[wind shear]].\n\nTwenty-one NWS Center Weather Service Units (CWSU) are collocated with the [[Federal Aviation Administration|Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)]] [[Area Control Center|Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC)]]. Their main responsibility is to provide up-to-the-minute weather information and briefings to the Traffic Management Units and control room supervisors. Special emphasis is given to weather conditions that could be hazardous to aviation or impede the flow of air traffic in the [[National Airspace System]]. Besides scheduled and unscheduled briefings for decision-makers in the ARTCC and other FAA facilities, CWSU meteorologists also issue two unscheduled products. The Center Weather Advisory (CWA) is an aviation weather warning for thunderstorms, icing, turbulence, and low [[ceiling (cloud)|cloud ceilings]] and visibilities. The Meteorological Impact Statement (MIS) is a two- to 12-hour forecast that outlines weather conditions expected to impact ARTCC operations.<ref name=\"awccwsus\">{{cite web|title=AWC \u2013 Center Weather Service Unit Products (CWA, MIS)|url=http://aviationweather.gov/products/cwsu/|website=Aviation Weather Center|publisher=National Weather Service|accessdate=December 11, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121226092742/http://aviationweather.gov/products/cwsu|archive-date=December 26, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe Aviation Weather Center (AWC), located in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], is a central aviation support facility operated by the National Weather Service, which issues two primary products:\n* [[AIRMET]] (Airmen's Meteorological Information) \u2013 Information on [[Icing conditions|icing]], [[turbulence]], mountain obscuration, low-level wind shear, [[instrument meteorological conditions]], and strong surface winds.\n* [[SIGMET]]s (Significant Meteorological Information) \u2013 Issued for significant weather that may affect an airport of flight path in an area:\n** Convective \u2013 Issued for an area of thunderstorms affecting an area of {{convert|3000|sqmi|km2}} or greater, a line of thunderstorms at least {{convert|60|nmi|km|abbr=on}} long, or severe or embedded thunderstorms affecting any area that are expected to last 30 minutes or longer.\n** Non-convective \u2013 Issued for severe turbulence over a {{convert|3000|sqmi|km2}} area, severe icing over a {{convert|3000|sqmi|km2}}, or instrument meteorological conditions over a {{convert|3000|sqmi|km2}} area due to dust, sand, or volcanic ash.\n\n====Storm Prediction Center====\n{{main|Storm Prediction Center}}\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center (SPC) in [[Norman, Oklahoma]] issues severe thunderstorm and tornado watches in cooperation with local WFOs which are responsible for delineating jurisdictions affected by the issued watch, and SPC also issues mesoscale discussions focused upon possible convective activity. SPC compiles reports of severe hail, wind, or tornadoes issued by local WFOs each day when thunderstorms producing such phenomena occur in a given area, and formats the data into text and graphical products. It also provides forecasts on convective activity through day eight of the forecast period (most prominently, the threat of severe thunderstorms, the risk of which is assessed through a tiered system conveyed among six categories \u2013 general thunderstorms, marginal, slight, enhanced, moderate, or high \u2013 based mainly on the expected number of storm reports and regional coverage of thunderstorm activity over a given forecast day), and is responsible for issuing fire weather outlooks, which support local WFOs in the determination of the need for Red Flag Warnings.\n\n====Weather Prediction Center====\n{{main|Weather Prediction Center}}\n\nThe [[Weather Prediction Center]] in [[College Park, Maryland]] provides guidance for future precipitation amounts and areas where excessive rainfall is likely,<ref name=\"AboutHPC\">{{cite web|title=About the HPC|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/html/about2.shtml|website=[[Hydrometeorological Prediction Center]] |accessdate=September 3, 2008}}</ref> while local NWS offices are responsible for issuing Flood Watches, Flash Flood Watches, Flood Warnings, Flash Flood Warnings, and Flood Advisories for their local County Warning Area, as well as the official rainfall forecast for areas within their warning area of responsibility. These products can and do emphasize different hydrologic issues depending on geographic area, land use, time of year, as well as other meteorological and non-meteorological factors (for example, during the early spring or late winter a Flood Warning can be issued for an [[ice jam]] that occurs on a river, while in the summer a Flood Warning will most likely be issued for excessive rainfall).\n\n[[File:2008-06-14 NOAA flooding overview.png|thumb|National AHPS map.]]\n\nIn recent years, the NWS has enhanced its dissemination of hydrologic information through the Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service (AHPS).<ref name=\"AHPShome\">{{cite web|title=About AHPS|url=http://www.weather.gov/ahps/about/about.php |publisher=National Weather Service|accessdate=December 19, 2008}}</ref> The AHPS allows anyone to view near real-time observation and forecast data for rivers, lakes and streams.

In addition to releasing routine outlooks and discussions, the guidance center initiates advisories and discussions on individual tropical cyclones, as needed. If a tropical cyclone threatens the United States or its territories, individual WFOs begin issuing statements detailing the expected effects within their local area of responsibility. The NHC and CPHC issue products including tropical cyclone advisories, forecasts, and formation predictions, and warnings for the areas in the Atlantic and parts of the Pacific.\n\n[[File:NOAA-CPC-seasonal-temp-outlook.gif|right|125px|thumb|Sample CPC 3.5-month temperature outlook.]]\n\n====Climate Prediction Center====\n{{main|Climate Prediction Center}}\n\nThe [[Climate Prediction Center]] (CPC) in [[College Park, Maryland]] is responsible for all of the NWS's climate-related forecasts. Their mission is to \"serve the public by assessing and forecasting the impacts of short-term climate variability, emphasizing enhanced risks of weather-related extreme events, for use in mitigating losses and maximizing economic gains.\" Their products cover time scales from a week to seasons, extending into the future as far as technically feasible, and cover the land, the ocean and the atmosphere, extending into the stratosphere. Most of the products issued by the center cover the [[Contiguous United States|Contiguous U.S.]] and [[Alaska]].\n\nAdditionally, Weather Forecast Offices issue daily and monthly climate reports for official climate stations within their area of responsibility. These generally include recorded highs, lows and other information (including historical temperature extremes, fifty-year temperature and precipitation averages, and [[degree day]]s). This information is considered preliminary until certified by the [[National Climatic Data Center]].\n\n==Data acquisition==\n\n===Surface observations===\n[[File:2008-07-01 Elko ASOS viewed from the south cropped.jpg|thumb|left|An Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS).]]\n\nThe primary network of surface weather observation stations in the United States is composed of [[Automated airport weather station#Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS)|Automated Surface Observing System]]s (ASOS). The ASOS program is a joint effort of the National Weather Service (NWS), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the Department of Defense (DOD).<ref name=\"asoshome\">{{cite web|title=NWS ASOS Program|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/asos/|publisher=National Weather Service|accessdate=December 19, 2008}}</ref> ASOS stations are designed to support weather forecast activities and aviation operations and, at the same time, support the needs of the meteorological, hydrological, and climatological research communities. ASOS was especially designed for the safety of the aviation community, therefore the sites are almost always located near airport runways. The system transmits routine hourly observations along with special observations when conditions exceed aviation weather thresholds (e.g. conditions change from [[visual meteorological conditions]] to [[instrument meteorological conditions]]). The basic weather elements observed are: sky condition, visibility, present weather, obstructions to vision, pressure, temperature, [[dew point]], wind direction and speed, precipitation accumulation, and selected significant remarks. The coded observations are issued as [[METAR]]s and look similar to this:\n METAR KNXX 121155Z 03018G29KT 1/4SM +TSSN FG VV002 M05/M07 A2957 RMK PK WND 01029/1143 SLP026\n SNINCR 2/10 RCRNR T2 SET 6///// 7//// 4/010 T10561067 11022 21056 55001 PWINO PNO FZRANO\n\n[[File:2013-10-14 12 33 44 National Weather Service Cooperative Observer site.JPG|thumb|A Cooperative Observer Program weather station.]]\n\nGetting more information on the atmosphere, more frequently, and from more locations is the key to improving forecasts and warnings. Due to the large installation and operating costs associated with ASOS, the stations are widely spaced. Therefore, the '''[[Cooperative Observer]] Program (COOP)''', a network of approximately 11,000 mostly volunteer weather observers, provides much of the meteorological and climatological data to the country. The program, which was established in 1890 under the Organic Act, currently has a twofold mission:\n* Provide observational meteorological data, usually consisting of daily maximum and minimum temperatures, snowfall, and 24-hour precipitation totals, required to define the climate of the United States and to help measure long-term climate changes.\n* Provide observational meteorological data in near real-time to support forecast, warning and other public service programs of the NWS.\n\nThe National Weather Service also maintains connections with privately operated [[mesonet]]s such as the [[Citizen Weather Observer Program]] for data collection, in part, through the [[Citizen Weather Observer Program#MADIS|Meteorological Assimilated Data Ingest System]] (MADIS). Funding is also provided to the [[Community Collaborative Rain, Hail and Snow Network|CoCoRaHS]] volunteer weather observer network through parent agency NOAA.\n\n===Marine observations===\n{{See also|Weather buoy|Weather ship}}\n[[Image:NOAA-NDBC-discus-buoy.jpg|left|135px|thumb|{{convert|3|m|adj=on}} discus buoy located off the Southeast U.S. coast.]]\n\nNWS forecasters need frequent, high-quality marine observations to examine conditions for forecast preparation and to verify their forecasts after they are produced. These observations are especially critical to the output of [[Numerical weather prediction|numerical weather models]] because large bodies of water have a profound impact on the weather. Other users rely on the observations and forecasts for commercial and recreational activities. To help meet these needs, the NWS's [[National Data Buoy Center]] (NDBC) in [[Hancock County, Mississippi]] operates a network of about 90 buoys and 60 land-based coastal observing systems (C-MAN). The stations measure wind speed, direction, and gust; barometric pressure; and air temperature.

An international program under World Meteorological Organization (WMO) marine auspices, the VOS has 49 countries as participants. The United States program is the largest in the world, with nearly 1,000 vessels. Observations are taken by deck officers, coded in a special format known as the \"ships synoptic code\", and transmitted in real-time to the NWS. They are then distributed on national and international circuits for use by meteorologists in weather forecasting, by oceanographers, ship routing services, fishermen, and many others. The observations are then forwarded for use by the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) in [[Asheville, North Carolina]].\n\n===Upper air observations===\n[[File:Radiosonde-wx-balloon.jpg|right|110px|thumb|A radiosonde shortly after launch.]]\n\nUpper air weather data is essential for weather forecasting and research. The NWS operates 92 [[radiosonde]] locations in [[North America]] and ten sites in [[the Caribbean]]. A small, expendable instrument package is suspended below a {{convert|2|m|ft}} wide balloon filled with [[hydrogen]] or [[helium]], then released daily at or shortly after 1100 and 2300 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], respectively. As the radiosonde rises at about 300 meters/minute (1,000&nbsp;ft/min), sensors on the radiosonde measure profiles of pressure, temperature, and relative humidity. These sensors are linked to a battery-powered radio transmitter that sends the sensor measurements to a ground receiver. By tracking the position of the radiosonde in flight, information on wind speed and direction aloft is also obtained. The flight can last longer than two hours, and during this time the radiosonde can ascend above {{convert|35|km|ft|abbr=on}} and drift more than {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the release point. When the balloon has expanded beyond its elastic limit and bursts (about {{convert|6|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} in diameter), a small parachute slows the descent of the radiosonde, minimizing the danger to lives and property. Data obtained during the flights is coded and disseminated, at which point it can be plotted on a [[Skew-T log-P diagram|Skew-T]] or Stuve diagram for analysis. In recent years, the National Weather Service has begun incorporating data from [[AMDAR]] in its numerical models (however, the raw data is not available to the public).\n\n==Event-driven products==\n{{Main|Severe weather terminology (United States)}}\n\nThe National Weather Service has developed a multi-tier concept for forecasting or alerting the public to all types of hazardous weather:\n* '''Outlook''' \u2013 Hazardous Weather Outlooks are issued daily by individual Weather Forecast Offices to address potentially hazardous weather or hydrologic events that may occur over the next seven days. The outlook will include information about the potential of convective thunderstorm activity (including the potential for severe thunderstorms), heavy rain or [[flood]]ing, winter weather, and extremes of heat or cold. It is intended to provide information to those who need considerable lead time to prepare for the event, including notification to storm spotter groups and local [[emergency management]] agencies on the recommendation of activation during severe weather situations in areas prone to such events. Other outlooks are issued on an event-driven basis, such as the Flood Potential Outlook and Severe Weather Outlook.\n* '''Advisory''' \u2013 An advisory is issued when a hazardous weather or hydrologic event is occurring, imminent, or likely. Advisories are for less serious conditions than warnings, that cause significant inconvenience and if caution is not exercised, could lead to situations that may threaten life or property.\n* '''Watch''' \u2013 A watch is used when the risk of a hazardous weather or hydrologic event has increased significantly, but its occurrence, location or timing is still uncertain. It is intended to provide enough lead time so those who need to set their safety plans in motion can do so in advance if a forecasted event should occur. A watch means that hazardous weather is possible, but not imminent. People should have a plan of action in case a storm threatens and monitor various avenues that provide NOAA-disseminated data to listen for later information and possible warnings, especially when planning travel or outdoor activities.\n* '''Warning''' \u2013 A warning is issued when a hazardous weather or hydrologic event is occurring, imminent or likely. A warning means weather conditions pose a threat to life or property. People in the path of the storm need to take protective action.\n* '''Special Weather Statement (or Significant Weather Advisory)''' \u2013 A special weather statement is issued when something rare or unusual is occurring. These are usually triggered by sudden changes in meteorological conditions. The statements are to be taken as warnings for residents of a specific area. Significant Weather Advisories are often issued for storms not severe enough for Severe Thunderstorm Warnings, but for strong winds and small hail. The warning generally states that an area might be at risk for a slight weather danger, though not all weather statements are warnings. Other times, statements describe informative facts about a weather system (such as local snowfall).\n\n===Weather warnings and advisories===\n{{Main|Severe weather terminology (United States)}}\nShort-fused [[weather warning]]s and advisories issued by local NWS forecast offices are generally less than {{convert|500|-|5000|sqmi|km2}} in area. Warnings for severe local storms are intended to be issued preceding the arrival of severe weather at a particular locale by one hour or less; the NWS also issues warnings and advisories for various hydrological and non-hydrological events including [[flood]]s, non-thunderstorm high winds, [[winter storm]]s, intense heat or cold, fire weather and marine hazards, which vary in timepsan depending on the weather situation ([[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches|inland and coastal warnings for tropical cyclones]] are issued by the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC), a guidance center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). The NWS defines a warning as a \"hazardous weather or hydrologic event [that] is occurring, is imminent, or has a very high probability of occurring\" and an advisory as \"[highlighting] special weather conditions that are less serious than a warning [...] for events that may cause significant inconvenience, and if caution is not exercised, [..] could lead to situations that may threaten life and/or property.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=National Weather Service Glossary: W|url=http://www.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?letter=w|website=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=May 26, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=National Weather Service Glossary: A|url=http://w1.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?letter=a|website=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=May 26, 2017}}</ref> In earnest, they indicate that hazardous weather conditions are occurring that may pose a risk to life and property, and are intended to direct the general public to take immediate action and heed safety precautions; it also has the side purpose of directing emergency management personnel to be on standby in case the weather situation leads to property damage or casualties. Severe thunderstorm and flood warnings indicate that organized severe thunderstorms or flooding are occurring, whereas tornado warnings are issued if a storm is indicated to be producing an observed tornado or exhibits strong, low-level rotation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Watch vs. Warning: What's the Difference|url=https://www.weatherworksinc.com/watch-vs-warning|website=WeatherWorks|date=June 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe process of issuing a warning or advisory begins with observations of a hydrological or extreme weather event that is either occurring at present (through radar imagery, reports from local television and radio stations, or ground observations by local law enforcement, civil defense officials, media outlets or storm spotters) or is forecast to occur within 12 to 24 hours. If after collaboration a warning or advisory is deemed necessary, the Weather Forecast Office will generate a bulletin product via the Advance Weather Interactive Processing System ([[AWIPS]]) and then disseminate the alert through various communication routes accessed by the media and various agencies, on the internet, to [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] satellites, and on [[NOAA Weather Radio]].<ref name=\"Dissemination\">{{cite web|title=NWS Dissemination Services|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/disemsys.shtml|website=NWS Office of Climate, Water, and Weather Services|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=January 10, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe product outlines the alert type, the issuing WFO, the sections of government subdivisions ([[County (United States)|county]], [[Parish (administrative division)|parish]] or [[borough]]s) covered by the alert, and its time of expiration (based on the local [[time zone]]). Some products \u2013 particularly for severe thunderstorm, tornado and flood warnings \u2013 include a tag requesting [[Emergency Alert System]] activation to trigger public alert messages via television, radio stations, NOAA Weather Radio, and smartphone apps and messaging services. For local storm events, the warning or advisory product also outlines a meteorological summary of the most recent storm location or local storm report issued prior to the product's issuance (including the approximate area in [[statute mile]]s and estimated speed and direction), associated hazards, impacts, municipalities and designated land areas (and, if applicable, highway mile markers) covered by the alert, and boilerplate action messages informing the public of safety precautions they need to take or advising them to be vigilant of any warnings or weather statements that may be issued by their local National Weather Service office. A statement may be issued as a follow-up message to a warning, watch, or emergency, which may update, extend, or cancel the previously issued product or be used as a notification of significant weather for which no type of alert is currently in effect for a given location or is expected to be in effect.\n\nIn situations where a forecaster indicates a significant threat of extremely severe and life-threatening weather with an ongoing local weather event, enhanced wording may be used to note the heightened threat by a significant local storm event. In April 2012, the NWS introduced the Impact Based Warning system at its Weather Forecast Offices in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] and [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], [[Kansas]], and [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]/[[Pleasant Hill, Missouri|Pleasant Hill]], [[Missouri]]; the pilot project \u2013 which would expand to 80 Weather Forecast Offices overseen by the Central, Eastern, Southern and Western Region Headquarters by the spring of 2015 \u2013 incorporate message tags within the main body of the product describing the source of the hazard report, damage potential, and if applicable, radar indications or physical observations of tornadoes or the possibility of a tornado; hazards are also summarized at the close of the product text (describing estimated maximum hail size and wind gusts, and if applicable, if a storm has the potential to produce a tornado or in the event of a tornado warning, the basis of the warning or its damage threat).<ref name=IBW>{{cite web|title=Impact Based Warnings|url=http://www.weather.gov/impacts/|website=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=March 12, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"NWS Expirements\">{{cite web|title=NWS Expirements|url=http://products.weather.gov/PDD/PDD_CR_IBW_011012.pdf|website=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=April 15, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413081255/http://products.weather.gov/PDD/PDD_CR_IBW_011012.pdf|archivedate=April 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title='CATASTROPHIC': Experimental Tornado Warnings to be Explicit|url=http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/catastrophic-and-unsurvivable/63553|author=y Jillian MacMath|website=[[AccuWeather]]|publisher=AccuWeather Inc.|date=April 5, 2012|accessdate=May 26, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=National Weather Service introduces impact-based warnings for tornadoes|url=https://www.earthmagazine.org/article/national-weather-service-introduces-impact-based-warnings-tornadoes|author=Nick Luchetti|periodical=Earth Magazine|publisher=[[American Geosciences Institute]]|date=April 15, 2013|accessdate=May 26, 2017}}</ref> The wording \"[[Particularly Dangerous Situation]]\" (PDS), which originated by the Storm Prediction Center for use in tornado watch products during expected high-end severe weather outbreaks, is subjectively issued.<ref name=\"PDS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/#2.7|title=Storm Prediction Center Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=April 18, 2004|accessdate=May 26, 2017}}</ref> It is occasionally issued with tornado warnings, normally if a large tornado capable of producing EF3 to EF5 damage or staying on the ground for long-duration \u2013 sometimes uninterrupted \u2013 paths has been reported (although a [[tornado emergency]] may be issued in such cases if the tornado is expected to track into a densely populated area).<ref name=\"PDS\"/> PDS warnings for other alerts occur with even less frequency, and their criteria varies depending on the alert type to which the wording is applied.<ref name=\"PDS\"/>\n\nUntil September 30, 2007, local offices of the National Weather Service issued warnings for severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, flash flooding and marine hazards using geopolitical boundaries. The implementation of storm-based warnings on October 1, 2007, saw alerts for these meteorological or hydrological threats be delineated by [[polygon]]al shapes in map-based weather hazard products, which outline the specified sections of government sub-jurisdictions that the warning covers, based on the projected path of a storm as determined by Doppler radar at the time of the warning's issuance; however, entire counties/parishes may sometimes be included in the warning polygon, especially if they encompass a small geographical area.<ref name=\"Storm-based\">{{cite web|title=Storm-Based Warnings: Why Storm-Based Warnings?|url=http://www.weather.gov/sbwarnings/|website=NOAA Warning Decision Training Branch|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=February 26, 2008|accessdate=January 11, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124141737/http://www.weather.gov/sbwarnings/|archive-date=January 24, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Warnings can be expanded, contracted (by removing jurisdictions where SPC and NWS forecasters no longer consider there to be a viable threat of severe weather, in which case, the storm-based warning may take on a [[trapezoid]]al representation in map-based watch products) or canceled before their set time of expiration by local NWS offices.\n\nThe NWS also releases Experimental Severe Weather Impact products for use on [[social media]] accounts maintained by local forecast offices as well as the Enhanced Data Display (EDD), an experimental pilot project created by the [[Charleston, West Virginia]] office's WeatherReady Nation initiative. The product provides a graphical depiction of short-fuse warnings and watches (specifically, tornado and severe thunderstorm watches and warnings, and flash flood warnings), showing a map of the warning area (outlined as a red polygon) and locations (including communities and interstate highways) that will be impacted. For severe thunderstorm, tornado and flash flood warnings, the estimated population count of the warned area and approximate totals of public schools and hospitals within the warning area as well as the maximum forecast intensity of hail size, wind gusts and potential tornadoes; tornado warnings referenced in the impact product also denote whether the warning was issued based on radar indication or ground confirmation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Experimental Severe Weather Impact Graphics|url=http://products.weather.gov/PDD/PDD-impact-graphics.pdf|publisher=National Weather Service|accessdate=May 26, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208073235/https://products.weather.gov/PDD/PDD-impact-graphics.pdf|archivedate=February 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Product dissemination==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}\n\n'''[[NOAA Weather Radio|NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards]] (NWR)''', promoted as \"The Voice of the National Weather Service\", is a special radio system that transmits uninterrupted weather watches, warnings and forecasts 24 hours a day directly from a nearby NWS office, with the broadcasts covering  across 95\u201397% of the United States' population. The system \u2013 which is owned and operated by the NWS \u2013 consists of 1,030 transmitters, covering all 50 states; adjacent coastal waters; [[Puerto Rico]]; the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]]; and the U.S. Pacific Territories of [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]] and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]. NWR requires a scanner or special radio receiver capable of picking up the signal. Individual NWR stations broadcast any one of seven allocated frequencies centered on 162 [[Megahertz|MHz]] (known collectively as \"weather band\") in the [[marine VHF radio]] band. In recent years, national emergency response agencies such as the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) and the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] have begun to take advantage of NWR's ability to efficiently reach a large portion of the U.S. population. When necessary, the system can also be used (in conjunction with the [[Emergency Alert System]]) to broadcast civil, natural and technological emergency and disaster alerts and information, in addition to those related to weather \u2013 hence the addition of the phrasing ''\"All Hazards\"'' to the name.\n\nThe '''NOAA Weather Wire Service (NWWS)''' is a satellite data collection and dissemination system operated by the National Weather Service, which was established in October 2000. Its purpose is to provide state and federal government, commercial users, media and private citizens with timely delivery of meteorological, hydrological, climatological and geophysical information. All products in the NWWS data stream are prioritized, with weather and hydrologic warnings receiving the highest priority (watches are next in priority). NWWS delivers [[severe weather]] and storm warnings to users in ten seconds or less from the time of their issuance, making it the fastest delivery system available. Products are broadcast to users via the [[SES Americom|AMC]]-4 satellite.\n\nThe '''Emergency Managers Weather Information Network ([[EMWIN]])''' is a system designed to provide the emergency management community with access to a set of NWS warnings, watches, forecasts and other products at no recurring cost. It can receive data via radio, internet, or a dedicated [[satellite dish]], depending on the needs and capabilities of the user.\n\n'''NOAAPORT''' is a one-way broadcast communication system which provides NOAA environmental data and information in near real-time to NOAA and external users. This broadcast service is implemented by a commercial provider of satellite communications utilizing [[C band (IEEE)|C band]].\n\nThe agency's online service, '''Weather.gov''', is a data rich website operated by the NWS that serves as a portal to hundreds of thousands of webpages and more than 300 different NWS websites. Through its homepage, users can access local forecasts by entering a place name in the main forecast search bar, view a rapidly updated map of active watches and warnings, and select areas related to graphical forecasts, national maps, radar displays, river and air quality data, satellite images and climate information. Also offered are XML data feeds of active watches and warnings, ASOS observations and digital forecasts for 5x5 kilometer grids. All of NWS local weather forecast offices operate their own region-tailored web pages, which provide access to current products and other information specific to the office's local area of responsibility. Weather.gov superseded the '''Interactive Weather Information Network (IWIN)''', the agency's early internet service which provided NWS data from the 1990s through the mid-2000s.\n\nSince 1983, the NWS has provided external user access to weather information obtained by or derived from the U.S. Government through a collection of data communication line services called the '''Family of Services (FOS)''', which is accessible via dedicated telecommunications access lines in the Washington, D.C., area. All FOS data services are driven by the NWS Telecommunication Gateway computer systems located at NWS headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland. Users may obtain any of the individual services from NWS for a one-time connection charge and an annual user fee.\n\n==Technology==\n[[Image:NWS-Mosaic-Radar-Composite.gif|thumb|200px|right|A NWS composite radar image of the [[w:Continental United States|Continental United States]], composed of many regional radars.]]\n\nThe WSR-88D [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] [[weather radar]] system, also called [[NEXRAD]], was developed by the National Weather Service during the mid-1980s, and fully deployed throughout the majority of the United States by 1997. There are 158 such [[radar]] sites in operation in the U.S., its various territorial possessions and selected overseas locations. This technology, because of its high resolution and ability to detect intra-cloud motions, is now the cornerstone of the agency's severe weather warning operations.\n\nNational Weather Service meteorologists use an advanced information processing, display and telecommunications system, the Advance Weather Interactive Processing System ([[AWIPS]]), to complete their work. These workstations allow them to easily view a multitude of weather and hydrologic information, as well as compose and disseminate products. The NWS [[Environmental Modeling Center]] was one of the early users of the [[ESMF]] common modeling infrastructure. The [[Global Forecast System]] (GFS) is one of the applications that is built on the framework.\n\nIn 2016, the NWS significantly increased the computational power of its supercomputers, spending $44 million on two new supercomputers from [[Cray]] and [[IBM]]. This was driven by relatively lower accuracy of NWS' [[Global Forecast System]] (GFS) [[numerical weather prediction]] model, compared to other global weather models.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Berger|first1=Eric|title=The US weather model is now the fourth best in the world|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/06/the-us-weather-model-is-now-the-fourth-best-in-the-world/ |website=Ars Technica|date=June 21, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Berger|first1=Eric|title=The European forecast model already kicking America's butt just improved|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/03/the-european-forecast-model-already-kicking-americas-butt-just-improved/ |accessdate=August 16, 2016|website=Ars Technica|date=March 11, 2016}}</ref> This was most notable in the GFS model incorrectly predicting [[Hurricane Sandy]] turning out to sea until four days before landfall; while the [[European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts]]' model predicted landfall correctly at seven days.

Under the proposal, 30% of NOAA's workforce would be reviewed for potential layoffs, and certain specialty forecasts of agricultural and economic importance would be eliminated. NOAA also proposed outsourcing of weather observation stations, NOAA Weather Radio and computerized surface analysis to private companies. The proposal was met with negative reaction among the public, members of Congress and consumer advocacy groups (including most notably, [[Ralph Nader]]), objecting to the possibility of weather information intended for the public domain being sold to private entities that would profit from the sale of the data.

The appropriate crews use this information to plan for staffing and equipment levels, the ability to conduct scheduled controlled burns, and assess the daily fire danger. Once per day, NWS meteorologists issue a coded fire weather forecast for specific [[United States Forest Service]] observation sites that are then input into the [[National Fire Danger Rating System]] (NFDRS).

These products alert the public and other agencies to conditions which create the potential for extreme fires. On the national level, the NWS [[Storm Prediction Center]] issues fire weather analyses for days one and two of the forecast period that provide supportive information to the local WFO forecasts regarding particular critical elements of fire weather conditions.

As opposed to a public weather forecast, a TAF only addresses weather elements critical to aviation; these include wind, [[visibility]], [[cloud|cloud cover]] and [[wind shear]].\n\nTwenty-one NWS Center Weather Service Units (CWSU) are collocated with the [[Federal Aviation Administration|Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)]] [[Area Control Center|Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC)]]. Their main responsibility is to provide up-to-the-minute weather information and briefings to the Traffic Management Units and control room supervisors. Special emphasis is given to weather conditions that could be hazardous to aviation or impede the flow of air traffic in the [[National Airspace System]]. Besides scheduled and unscheduled briefings for decision-makers in the ARTCC and other FAA facilities, CWSU meteorologists also issue two unscheduled products. The Center Weather Advisory (CWA) is an aviation weather warning for thunderstorms, icing, turbulence, and low [[ceiling (cloud)|cloud ceilings]] and visibilities.

The service also enables the NWS to provide long-range probabilistic information which can be used for long-range planning decisions.\n\n====River Forecast Centers====\nDaily river forecasts are issued by the thirteen River Forecast Centers (RFCs) using hydrologic models based on rainfall, soil characteristics, precipitation forecasts, and several other variables. The first such center was founded on September 23, 1946.<ref name=\"ERHhist\">{{cite web|title=History of OHRFC|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/ohrfc/history.html |publisher=National Weather Service|accessdate=February 26, 2012}}</ref> Some RFCs, especially those in mountainous regions, also provide seasonal snow pack and peak flow forecasts. These forecasts are used by a wide range of users, including those in [[agriculture]], [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric dam]] operation, and [[Water resources|water supply]] resources.\n\n====Ocean Prediction Center====\n[[File:NWSmarinezones.gif|thumb|The National Weather Service areas of marine weather forecasting responsibility.]]\n{{main|Ocean Prediction Center}}\n\nThe National Weather Service [[Ocean Prediction Center]] (OPC) in [[College Park, Maryland]]<ref name=\"OPChome\">{{cite web|title=Ocean Prediction Center|url=http://www.opc.ncep.noaa.gov/|website=[[National Centers for Environmental Prediction]]|publisher=National Weather Service|accessdate=December 15, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006170925/http://www.opc.ncep.noaa.gov/|archive-date=October 6, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> issues [[marine weather forecasting|marine products]] for areas that are within the national waters of the United States. NWS national centers or Weather Forecast Offices issue several marine products:\n* Coastal Waters Forecast (CWF) \u2013 a text product issued by all coastal WFOs to explicitly state expected weather conditions within their marine forecast area of responsibility through day five; it also addresses expected wave heights.\n* Offshore Waters Forecast (OFF) \u2013 a text product issued by the OPC that provides forecast and warning information to mariners who travel on the oceanic waters adjacent to the U.S. coastal waters through day five. \n* NAVTEX forecast \u2013 a text forecast issued by the OPC (combining data from the Coastal Waters and Offshore Waters Forecasts) designed to accommodate broadcast restrictions of [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] [[NAVTEX]] transmitters. \n* High Seas Forecast (HSF) \u2013 routine text product issued every six hours by OPC to provide warning and forecast information to mariners who travel on the oceanic waters.\n\n====National Hurricane Center====\n{{main|National Hurricane Center}}\n\nThe [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) and the [[Central Pacific Hurricane Center]] (CPHC), respectively based in [[Miami, Florida]] and [[Honolulu, Hawaii]], are responsible for monitoring tropical weather in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], and central and eastern [[Pacific Ocean]]s. In addition to releasing routine outlooks and discussions, the guidance center initiates advisories and discussions on individual tropical cyclones, as needed. If a tropical cyclone threatens the United States or its territories, individual WFOs begin issuing statements detailing the expected effects within their local area of responsibility. The NHC and CPHC issue products including tropical cyclone advisories, forecasts, and formation predictions, and warnings for the areas in the Atlantic and parts of the Pacific.\n\n[[File:NOAA-CPC-seasonal-temp-outlook.gif|right|125px|thumb|Sample CPC 3.5-month temperature outlook.]]\n\n====Climate Prediction Center====\n{{main|Climate Prediction Center}}\n\nThe [[Climate Prediction Center]] (CPC) in [[College Park, Maryland]] is responsible for all of the NWS's climate-related forecasts. Their mission is to \"serve the public by assessing and forecasting the impacts of short-term climate variability, emphasizing enhanced risks of weather-related extreme events, for use in mitigating losses and maximizing economic gains.\" Their products cover time scales from a week to seasons, extending into the future as far as technically feasible, and cover the land, the ocean and the atmosphere, extending into the stratosphere. Most of the products issued by the center cover the [[Contiguous United States|Contiguous U.S.]] and [[Alaska]].\n\nAdditionally, Weather Forecast Offices issue daily and monthly climate reports for official climate stations within their area of responsibility. These generally include recorded highs, lows and other information (including historical temperature extremes, fifty-year temperature and precipitation averages, and [[degree day]]s). This information is considered preliminary until certified by the [[National Climatic Data Center]].\n\n==Data acquisition==\n\n===Surface observations===\n[[File:2008-07-01 Elko ASOS viewed from the south cropped.jpg|thumb|left|An Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS).]]\n\nThe primary network of surface weather observation stations in the United States is composed of [[Automated airport weather station#Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS)|Automated Surface Observing System]]s (ASOS). The ASOS program is a joint effort of the National Weather Service (NWS), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the Department of Defense (DOD).<ref name=\"asoshome\">{{cite web|title=NWS ASOS Program|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/asos/|publisher=National Weather Service|accessdate=December 19, 2008}}</ref> ASOS stations are designed to support weather forecast activities and aviation operations and, at the same time, support the needs of the meteorological, hydrological, and climatological research communities. ASOS was especially designed for the safety of the aviation community, therefore the sites are almost always located near airport runways. The system transmits routine hourly observations along with special observations when conditions exceed aviation weather thresholds (e.g. conditions change from [[visual meteorological conditions]] to [[instrument meteorological conditions]]). The basic weather elements observed are: sky condition, visibility, present weather, obstructions to vision, pressure, temperature, [[dew point]], wind direction and speed, precipitation accumulation, and selected significant remarks. The coded observations are issued as [[METAR]]s and look similar to this:\n METAR KNXX 121155Z 03018G29KT 1/4SM +TSSN FG VV002 M05/M07 A2957 RMK PK WND 01029/1143 SLP026\n SNINCR 2/10 RCRNR T2 SET 6///// 7//// 4/010 T10561067 11022 21056 55001 PWINO PNO FZRANO\n\n[[File:2013-10-14 12 33 44 National Weather Service Cooperative Observer site.JPG|thumb|A Cooperative Observer Program weather station.]]\n\nGetting more information on the atmosphere, more frequently, and from more locations is the key to improving forecasts and warnings. Due to the large installation and operating costs associated with ASOS, the stations are widely spaced. Therefore, the '''[[Cooperative Observer]] Program (COOP)''', a network of approximately 11,000 mostly volunteer weather observers, provides much of the meteorological and climatological data to the country. The program, which was established in 1890 under the Organic Act, currently has a twofold mission:\n* Provide observational meteorological data, usually consisting of daily maximum and minimum temperatures, snowfall, and 24-hour precipitation totals, required to define the climate of the United States and to help measure long-term climate changes.\n* Provide observational meteorological data in near real-time to support forecast, warning and other public service programs of the NWS.\n\nThe National Weather Service also maintains connections with privately operated [[mesonet]]s such as the [[Citizen Weather Observer Program]] for data collection, in part, through the [[Citizen Weather Observer Program#MADIS|Meteorological Assimilated Data Ingest System]] (MADIS). Funding is also provided to the [[Community Collaborative Rain, Hail and Snow Network|CoCoRaHS]] volunteer weather observer network through parent agency NOAA.\n\n===Marine observations===\n{{See also|Weather buoy|Weather ship}}\n[[Image:NOAA-NDBC-discus-buoy.jpg|left|135px|thumb|{{convert|3|m|adj=on}} discus buoy located off the Southeast U.S. coast.]]\n\nNWS forecasters need frequent, high-quality marine observations to examine conditions for forecast preparation and to verify their forecasts after they are produced. These observations are especially critical to the output of [[Numerical weather prediction|numerical weather models]] because large bodies of water have a profound impact on the weather. Other users rely on the observations and forecasts for commercial and recreational activities. To help meet these needs, the NWS's [[National Data Buoy Center]] (NDBC) in [[Hancock County, Mississippi]] operates a network of about 90 buoys and 60 land-based coastal observing systems (C-MAN). The stations measure wind speed, direction, and gust; barometric pressure; and air temperature. In addition, all buoy and some C-MAN stations measure sea surface temperature, and wave height and period.<ref name=\"NDBCmr\">{{cite web|title=Moored Buoy Program|url=http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/mooredbuoy.shtml|website=[[National Data Buoy Center]]|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|date=February 4, 2008|accessdate=January 29, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103084317/http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/mooredbuoy.shtml|archive-date=January 3, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Conductivity and water current are measured at selected stations.

An international program under World Meteorological Organization (WMO) marine auspices, the VOS has 49 countries as participants. The United States program is the largest in the world, with nearly 1,000 vessels. Observations are taken by deck officers, coded in a special format known as the \"ships synoptic code\", and transmitted in real-time to the NWS. They are then distributed on national and international circuits for use by meteorologists in weather forecasting, by oceanographers, ship routing services, fishermen, and many others. The observations are then forwarded for use by the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) in [[Asheville, North Carolina]].\n\n===Upper air observations===\n[[File:Radiosonde-wx-balloon.jpg|right|110px|thumb|A radiosonde shortly after launch.]]\n\nUpper air weather data is essential for weather forecasting and research. The NWS operates 92 [[radiosonde]] locations in [[North America]] and ten sites in [[the Caribbean]]. A small, expendable instrument package is suspended below a {{convert|2|m|ft}} wide balloon filled with [[hydrogen]] or [[helium]], then released daily at or shortly after 1100 and 2300 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], respectively. As the radiosonde rises at about 300 meters/minute (1,000&nbsp;ft/min), sensors on the radiosonde measure profiles of pressure, temperature, and relative humidity. These sensors are linked to a battery-powered radio transmitter that sends the sensor measurements to a ground receiver. By tracking the position of the radiosonde in flight, information on wind speed and direction aloft is also obtained. The flight can last longer than two hours, and during this time the radiosonde can ascend above {{convert|35|km|ft|abbr=on}} and drift more than {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the release point. When the balloon has expanded beyond its elastic limit and bursts (about {{convert|6|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} in diameter), a small parachute slows the descent of the radiosonde, minimizing the danger to lives and property. Data obtained during the flights is coded and disseminated, at which point it can be plotted on a [[Skew-T log-P diagram|Skew-T]] or Stuve diagram for analysis. In recent years, the National Weather Service has begun incorporating data from [[AMDAR]] in its numerical models (however, the raw data is not available to the public).\n\n==Event-driven products==\n{{Main|Severe weather terminology (United States)}}\n\nThe National Weather Service has developed a multi-tier concept for forecasting or alerting the public to all types of hazardous weather:\n* '''Outlook''' \u2013 Hazardous Weather Outlooks are issued daily by individual Weather Forecast Offices to address potentially hazardous weather or hydrologic events that may occur over the next seven days. The outlook will include information about the potential of convective thunderstorm activity (including the potential for severe thunderstorms), heavy rain or [[flood]]ing, winter weather, and extremes of heat or cold. It is intended to provide information to those who need considerable lead time to prepare for the event, including notification to storm spotter groups and local [[emergency management]] agencies on the recommendation of activation during severe weather situations in areas prone to such events. Other outlooks are issued on an event-driven basis, such as the Flood Potential Outlook and Severe Weather Outlook.\n* '''Advisory''' \u2013 An advisory is issued when a hazardous weather or hydrologic event is occurring, imminent, or likely. Advisories are for less serious conditions than warnings, that cause significant inconvenience and if caution is not exercised, could lead to situations that may threaten life or property.\n* '''Watch''' \u2013 A watch is used when the risk of a hazardous weather or hydrologic event has increased significantly, but its occurrence, location or timing is still uncertain. It is intended to provide enough lead time so those who need to set their safety plans in motion can do so in advance if a forecasted event should occur. A watch means that hazardous weather is possible, but not imminent. People should have a plan of action in case a storm threatens and monitor various avenues that provide NOAA-disseminated data to listen for later information and possible warnings, especially when planning travel or outdoor activities.\n* '''Warning''' \u2013 A warning is issued when a hazardous weather or hydrologic event is occurring, imminent or likely. A warning means weather conditions pose a threat to life or property. People in the path of the storm need to take protective action.\n* '''Special Weather Statement (or Significant Weather Advisory)''' \u2013 A special weather statement is issued when something rare or unusual is occurring. These are usually triggered by sudden changes in meteorological conditions. The statements are to be taken as warnings for residents of a specific area. Significant Weather Advisories are often issued for storms not severe enough for Severe Thunderstorm Warnings, but for strong winds and small hail. The warning generally states that an area might be at risk for a slight weather danger, though not all weather statements are warnings. Other times, statements describe informative facts about a weather system (such as local snowfall).\n\n===Weather warnings and advisories===\n{{Main|Severe weather terminology (United States)}}\nShort-fused [[weather warning]]s and advisories issued by local NWS forecast offices are generally less than {{convert|500|-|5000|sqmi|km2}} in area. Warnings for severe local storms are intended to be issued preceding the arrival of severe weather at a particular locale by one hour or less; the NWS also issues warnings and advisories for various hydrological and non-hydrological events including [[flood]]s, non-thunderstorm high winds, [[winter storm]]s, intense heat or cold, fire weather and marine hazards, which vary in timepsan depending on the weather situation ([[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches|inland and coastal warnings for tropical cyclones]] are issued by the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC), a guidance center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). The NWS defines a warning as a \"hazardous weather or hydrologic event [that] is occurring, is imminent, or has a very high probability of occurring\" and an advisory as \"[highlighting] special weather conditions that are less serious than a warning [...] for events that may cause significant inconvenience, and if caution is not exercised, [..] could lead to situations that may threaten life and/or property.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=National Weather Service Glossary: W|url=http://www.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?letter=w|website=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=May 26, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=National Weather Service Glossary: A|url=http://w1.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?letter=a|website=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=May 26, 2017}}</ref> In earnest, they indicate that hazardous weather conditions are occurring that may pose a risk to life and property, and are intended to direct the general public to take immediate action and heed safety precautions; it also has the side purpose of directing emergency management personnel to be on standby in case the weather situation leads to property damage or casualties. Severe thunderstorm and flood warnings indicate that organized severe thunderstorms or flooding are occurring, whereas tornado warnings are issued if a storm is indicated to be producing an observed tornado or exhibits strong, low-level rotation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Watch vs. Warning: What's the Difference|url=https://www.weatherworksinc.com/watch-vs-warning|website=WeatherWorks|date=June 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe process of issuing a warning or advisory begins with observations of a hydrological or extreme weather event that is either occurring at present (through radar imagery, reports from local television and radio stations, or ground observations by local law enforcement, civil defense officials, media outlets or storm spotters) or is forecast to occur within 12 to 24 hours. If after collaboration a warning or advisory is deemed necessary, the Weather Forecast Office will generate a bulletin product via the Advance Weather Interactive Processing System ([[AWIPS]]) and then disseminate the alert through various communication routes accessed by the media and various agencies, on the internet, to [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] satellites, and on [[NOAA Weather Radio]].<ref name=\"Dissemination\">{{cite web|title=NWS Dissemination Services|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/disemsys.shtml|website=NWS Office of Climate, Water, and Weather Services|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=January 10, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe product outlines the alert type, the issuing WFO, the sections of government subdivisions ([[County (United States)|county]], [[Parish (administrative division)|parish]] or [[borough]]s) covered by the alert, and its time of expiration (based on the local [[time zone]]). Some products \u2013 particularly for severe thunderstorm, tornado and flood warnings \u2013 include a tag requesting [[Emergency Alert System]] activation to trigger public alert messages via television, radio stations, NOAA Weather Radio, and smartphone apps and messaging services. For local storm events, the warning or advisory product also outlines a meteorological summary of the most recent storm location or local storm report issued prior to the product's issuance (including the approximate area in [[statute mile]]s and estimated speed and direction), associated hazards, impacts, municipalities and designated land areas (and, if applicable, highway mile markers) covered by the alert, and boilerplate action messages informing the public of safety precautions they need to take or advising them to be vigilant of any warnings or weather statements that may be issued by their local National Weather Service office. A statement may be issued as a follow-up message to a warning, watch, or emergency, which may update, extend, or cancel the previously issued product or be used as a notification of significant weather for which no type of alert is currently in effect for a given location or is expected to be in effect.\n\nIn situations where a forecaster indicates a significant threat of extremely severe and life-threatening weather with an ongoing local weather event, enhanced wording may be used to note the heightened threat by a significant local storm event. In April 2012, the NWS introduced the Impact Based Warning system at its Weather Forecast Offices in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] and [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], [[Kansas]], and [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]/[[Pleasant Hill, Missouri|Pleasant Hill]], [[Missouri]]; the pilot project \u2013 which would expand to 80 Weather Forecast Offices overseen by the Central, Eastern, Southern and Western Region Headquarters by the spring of 2015 \u2013 incorporate message tags within the main body of the product describing the source of the hazard report, damage potential, and if applicable, radar indications or physical observations of tornadoes or the possibility of a tornado; hazards are also summarized at the close of the product text (describing estimated maximum hail size and wind gusts, and if applicable, if a storm has the potential to produce a tornado or in the event of a tornado warning, the basis of the warning or its damage threat).<ref name=IBW>{{cite web|title=Impact Based Warnings|url=http://www.weather.gov/impacts/|website=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=March 12, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"NWS Expirements\">{{cite web|title=NWS Expirements|url=http://products.weather.gov/PDD/PDD_CR_IBW_011012.pdf|website=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=April 15, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413081255/http://products.weather.gov/PDD/PDD_CR_IBW_011012.pdf|archivedate=April 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title='CATASTROPHIC': Experimental Tornado Warnings to be Explicit|url=http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/catastrophic-and-unsurvivable/63553|author=y Jillian MacMath|website=[[AccuWeather]]|publisher=AccuWeather Inc.|date=April 5, 2012|accessdate=May 26, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=National Weather Service introduces impact-based warnings for tornadoes|url=https://www.earthmagazine.org/article/national-weather-service-introduces-impact-based-warnings-tornadoes|author=Nick Luchetti|periodical=Earth Magazine|publisher=[[American Geosciences Institute]]|date=April 15, 2013|accessdate=May 26, 2017}}</ref> The wording \"[[Particularly Dangerous Situation]]\" (PDS), which originated by the Storm Prediction Center for use in tornado watch products during expected high-end severe weather outbreaks, is subjectively issued.<ref name=\"PDS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/#2.7|title=Storm Prediction Center Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=April 18, 2004|accessdate=May 26, 2017}}</ref> It is occasionally issued with tornado warnings, normally if a large tornado capable of producing EF3 to EF5 damage or staying on the ground for long-duration \u2013 sometimes uninterrupted \u2013 paths has been reported (although a [[tornado emergency]] may be issued in such cases if the tornado is expected to track into a densely populated area).<ref name=\"PDS\"/> PDS warnings for other alerts occur with even less frequency, and their criteria varies depending on the alert type to which the wording is applied.<ref name=\"PDS\"/>\n\nUntil September 30, 2007, local offices of the National Weather Service issued warnings for severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, flash flooding and marine hazards using geopolitical boundaries.

The system \u2013 which is owned and operated by the NWS \u2013 consists of 1,030 transmitters, covering all 50 states; adjacent coastal waters; [[Puerto Rico]]; the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]]; and the U.S. Pacific Territories of [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]] and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]. NWR requires a scanner or special radio receiver capable of picking up the signal. Individual NWR stations broadcast any one of seven allocated frequencies centered on 162 [[Megahertz|MHz]] (known collectively as \"weather band\") in the [[marine VHF radio]] band. In recent years, national emergency response agencies such as the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) and the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] have begun to take advantage of NWR's ability to efficiently reach a large portion of the U.S. population. When necessary, the system can also be used (in conjunction with the [[Emergency Alert System]]) to broadcast civil, natural and technological emergency and disaster alerts and information, in addition to those related to weather \u2013 hence the addition of the phrasing ''\"All Hazards\"'' to the name.\n\nThe '''NOAA Weather Wire Service (NWWS)''' is a satellite data collection and dissemination system operated by the National Weather Service, which was established in October 2000. Its purpose is to provide state and federal government, commercial users, media and private citizens with timely delivery of meteorological, hydrological, climatological and geophysical information. All products in the NWWS data stream are prioritized, with weather and hydrologic warnings receiving the highest priority (watches are next in priority). NWWS delivers [[severe weather]] and storm warnings to users in ten seconds or less from the time of their issuance, making it the fastest delivery system available. Products are broadcast to users via the [[SES Americom|AMC]]-4 satellite.\n\nThe '''Emergency Managers Weather Information Network ([[EMWIN]])''' is a system designed to provide the emergency management community with access to a set of NWS warnings, watches, forecasts and other products at no recurring cost. It can receive data via radio, internet, or a dedicated [[satellite dish]], depending on the needs and capabilities of the user.\n\n'''NOAAPORT''' is a one-way broadcast communication system which provides NOAA environmental data and information in near real-time to NOAA and external users. This broadcast service is implemented by a commercial provider of satellite communications utilizing [[C band (IEEE)|C band]].\n\nThe agency's online service, '''Weather.gov''', is a data rich website operated by the NWS that serves as a portal to hundreds of thousands of webpages and more than 300 different NWS websites. Through its homepage, users can access local forecasts by entering a place name in the main forecast search bar, view a rapidly updated map of active watches and warnings, and select areas related to graphical forecasts, national maps, radar displays, river and air quality data, satellite images and climate information. Also offered are XML data feeds of active watches and warnings, ASOS observations and digital forecasts for 5x5 kilometer grids. All of NWS local weather forecast offices operate their own region-tailored web pages, which provide access to current products and other information specific to the office's local area of responsibility. Weather.gov superseded the '''Interactive Weather Information Network (IWIN)''', the agency's early internet service which provided NWS data from the 1990s through the mid-2000s.\n\nSince 1983, the NWS has provided external user access to weather information obtained by or derived from the U.S. Government through a collection of data communication line services called the '''Family of Services (FOS)''', which is accessible via dedicated telecommunications access lines in the Washington, D.C., area. All FOS data services are driven by the NWS Telecommunication Gateway computer systems located at NWS headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland. Users may obtain any of the individual services from NWS for a one-time connection charge and an annual user fee.\n\n==Technology==\n[[Image:NWS-Mosaic-Radar-Composite.gif|thumb|200px|right|A NWS composite radar image of the [[w:Continental United States|Continental United States]], composed of many regional radars.]]\n\nThe WSR-88D [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] [[weather radar]] system, also called [[NEXRAD]], was developed by the National Weather Service during the mid-1980s, and fully deployed throughout the majority of the United States by 1997. There are 158 such [[radar]] sites in operation in the U.S., its various territorial possessions and selected overseas locations. This technology, because of its high resolution and ability to detect intra-cloud motions, is now the cornerstone of the agency's severe weather warning operations.\n\nNational Weather Service meteorologists use an advanced information processing, display and telecommunications system, the Advance Weather Interactive Processing System ([[AWIPS]]), to complete their work. These workstations allow them to easily view a multitude of weather and hydrologic information, as well as compose and disseminate products. The NWS [[Environmental Modeling Center]] was one of the early users of the [[ESMF]] common modeling infrastructure. The [[Global Forecast System]] (GFS) is one of the applications that is built on the framework.\n\nIn 2016, the NWS significantly increased the computational power of its supercomputers, spending $44 million on two new supercomputers from [[Cray]] and [[IBM]]. This was driven by relatively lower accuracy of NWS' [[Global Forecast System]] (GFS) [[numerical weather prediction]] model, compared to other global weather models.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Berger|first1=Eric|title=The US weather model is now the fourth best in the world|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/06/the-us-weather-model-is-now-the-fourth-best-in-the-world/ |website=Ars Technica|date=June 21, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Berger|first1=Eric|title=The European forecast model already kicking America's butt just improved|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/03/the-european-forecast-model-already-kicking-americas-butt-just-improved/ |accessdate=August 16, 2016|website=Ars Technica|date=March 11, 2016}}</ref> This was most notable in the GFS model incorrectly predicting [[Hurricane Sandy]] turning out to sea until four days before landfall; while the [[European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts]]' model predicted landfall correctly at seven days.

Byrne announced a proposal to sell all of the agency's weather satellites at auction with the intent to repurchase the weather data from private contractors that would acquire the satellites. Under the proposal, 30% of NOAA's workforce would be reviewed for potential layoffs, and certain specialty forecasts of agricultural and economic importance would be eliminated. NOAA also proposed outsourcing of weather observation stations, NOAA Weather Radio and computerized surface analysis to private companies. The proposal was met with negative reaction among the public, members of Congress and consumer advocacy groups (including most notably, [[Ralph Nader]]), objecting to the possibility of weather information intended for the public domain being sold to private entities that would profit from the sale of the data. The proposal to sell the satellite network failed in a Congressional vote, while other aspects of the proposal to dismantle portions of NOAA's agencies were eventually scuttled.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite book|title=Storm Warning: The Story of a Killer Tornado|author=Nancy Mathis|publisher=Touchstone|pages=[https://archive.org/details/stormwarningstor00math/page/90 90\u201391]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7432-8053-2|url=https://archive.org/details/stormwarningstor00math/page/90}}</ref>\n\n===Failed Santorum proposal===\n{{main|National Weather Service Duties Act of 2005}}\n\nIn 2005, [[Pennsylvania]] Senator [[Rick Santorum]] introduced the [[National Weather Service Duties Act of 2005]],<ref name=\"LOCNWSDA\">{{cite web|title=S.786 \u2013 National Weather Services Duties Act of 2005|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:S.786|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}</ref> a [[Bill (law)|bill]] which would have prohibited the NWS from freely distributing weather data.

He was educated at [[Bromsgrove School]] in [[Worcestershire]] (and later in life he became the \"President of the School\" from 1983 to 1994).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bromsgrovians.com/HistoryAndHeadmasters|title=The History and Headmasters of Bromsgrove School|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> His father was a landowner and [[Lord Mayor]] of [[Daventry]], who farmed 500 acres in [[Northamptonshire]].<ref name=Guardian>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/mar/12/guardianobituaries.conservatives|title=Lord Boardman|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=12 March 2003|accessdate=22 August 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"The Times\" /> Like many of his generation, Boardman's formative years were shaped by the increasingly real prospect of war. On leaving school, Boardman paid \u00a3500 to become an [[articled clerk]] with a local [[solicitor]], but in 1938, despite an early interest in the law and politics, enlisted into the [[British Army]] as a trooper in the 1st [[Northamptonshire Yeomanry]].<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" />\n\n==Military service==\n\nAt the start of the [[World War II]], Boardman was selected for training at the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], and commissioned as a [[Second Lieutenant]] on 14 September 1940.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=34950|supp=y|page=5632|date=20 September 1940}}</ref> He was promoted through the ranks to [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] and commanded the 1st Battalion [[Northamptonshire Yeomanry]] during the North West Europe campaign.<ref name=\"The Times\" /> He won the [[Military Cross]] (MC) in Normandy during [[Operation Overlord]], in the early part of the operation to trap German forces in the [[Falaise Pocket]].<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" />\n\nAfter the [[D-Day landings]] in 1944, Boardman was detailed to act as navigator for four armoured columns formed from the Northamptonshire Yeomanry, and [[Black Watch|1st Battalion Black Watch]]. The columns were to take [[Saint-Aignan-de-Cramesnil]], about 20 kilometres south of [[Caen]].<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" />\n\nOn 6 and 7 August 1944, Boardman conducted [[reconnaissance]] in [[no man's land]], despite German fire, to allow him to establish the route in darkness. In the night attack of 7/8 August, he then successfully spearheaded the columns forward through the Falaise Gap towards the village of St Aignan de Cramesnil, several times dismounting from his tank, and going back on foot to find parts of the columns which had lost touch. He had to illuminate the way forward with [[Very lights]], making himself a highly visible target for enemy fire. Having used all his flares, Boardman had to run back to the second tank in the column to find more, in so doing he almost fell into a slit trench full of Germans; but the objective was achieved.<ref name=\"The Telegraph\">{{cite news|title=Lord Boardman|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1424334/Lord-Boardman.html|accessdate=26 February 2017|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=12 March 2003}}</ref>\n\nOn 8 August 1944, [[Kurt Meyer]], of the [[SS Hitlerjugend Division]], ordered elements of his command to [[counterattack]] and recapture the high ground taken by [[the Allies (WWII)|The Allies]].{{sfn|Reid|2005|p=410}}{{sfn|Hart|2007|pp=52\u201369}} [[Michael Wittmann]] 'The Black Baron' a notable German [[Waffen-SS]] tank commander, led a group of seven [[Tiger I|Tiger tank]]s, from the Heavy SS-Panzer Battalion 101, supported by additional tanks and infantry. Boardman, with A Squadron 1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry, ambushed the Tigers crossing open terrain towards the high ground from the tree line.  It was Boardman's order to the gunner [[Joe Ekins]], which killed Wittman. According to the historian Hart, Boardman's unit was positioned in a wood on the right flank of the advancing Tiger tanks. At approximately 12:47, they engaged them, halting the attack, and killing Wittmann.{{sfn|Hart|2007|pp=60, 65}} Boardman's [[Squadron (army)|squadron]] (of which he was second in command) beat off the heavy counter-attack and the citation for his Military Cross gives much of the credit for this, and the destruction of 12 German tanks, to him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7705890|title=Documents Online\u2014Recommendations for Honours and Awards (Army)\u2014Image details: Boardman, Thomas Gray|accessdate=22 August 2008}}</ref> His MC was [[London Gazette|gazetted]] on 21 December 1944.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=36850|supp=y|pages=5854\u20135855|date=19 December 1944}}</ref>\n\nBoardman was later the [[Commanding Officer]] of the Northamptonshire Yeomanry, when they became part of the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]].<ref name=\"The Times\" />\n\n==Political Service==\n\nAt the end of the [[World War II]], Boardman took his law exams at Gibson & Wheldon (subsequently renamed [[The University of Law]])<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" />  and passed out top. He qualified and practised as a [[solicitor]] in [[Northampton]], and served on the boards of several companies; his sound judgment made him a valued contributor to business as director.<ref name=\"The Independent\" /> He became the Finance Director of [[Allied Breweries]] and, in 1958, he became chairman of Chamberlain Phipps, the [[Wellingborough]] manufacturer of adhesives, insulation, cladding and footwear components.<ref name=\"The Times\" /> He held this position until 1978.\n\nBoardman's interest in [[Conservative politics]] brought his adoption as the Conservative candidate for [[Leicester South-West]], where he fought [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour's]] [[Chief Whip]], [[Herbert Bowden]], in the 1964 and 1966 elections. Bowden was elevated to the [[House of Lords]] in 1967 and Boardman, at the age of 48, then won the parliamentary seat in a sensational [[by-election]] beating the Labour candidate Neville Sandelson and turning a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] majority into a Conservative majority of 3,939 (15.7 per cent).<ref name=\"The Independent\" />\n\nIt was a period of considerable Conservative success and Boardman consolidated his hold on the seat. In 1970, he beat off a fierce Labour challenge by just 106 votes.<ref name=\"The Independent\" />\n<ref name=\"Guardian\" /><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=45134|page=6946|date=23 June 1970}}</ref> By then, his fellow Conservatives had already elected him to the executive of the [[1922 Committee]] and he was chairman of the parliamentary panel of the [[Institute of Directors]]. Business commitments prevented him accepting the first government job offered to him, as [[Principal Private Secretary]] to [[Margaret Thatcher]].\n\nBoardman's skills had been rapidly recognised by the incoming Conservative government of [[Edward Heath]] in 1970. He quickly earned a reputation for speaking publicly only about subjects that he knew well, particularly in the realms of industry and commerce. In April 1972, he was made Minister for Industry at the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]], where he was seen by many as a powerful advocate of progress in industry.<ref name=\"The Times\" />  Heath brought Boardman in to help take forward the industrial expansion programme, in a reshuffle which followed the unveiling of the Industry Bill. This was Heath's notorious 'U-turn' on industrial policy, in which a free market approach was abandoned in favour of a return to intervention, subsidy for 'lame ducks' and price controls.<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" /><ref name=\"The Independent\">{{cite news|title=Lord Boardman|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/lord-boardman-36334.html|accessdate=26 February 2017|publisher=The Independent|date=12 March 2003}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Miners' strike|1972 miners' strike]], Boardman steered the Coal Industry Act through Parliament; it injected huge subsidies to keep the [[National Coal Board]] solvent. Having achieved a record pay award as part of that settlement, the miners were quiescent until the summer of 1973, when they demanded another 35 per cent.<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" />\n\nBoardman and his fellow junior minister, [[Peter Emery]], represented the government in the negotiations that followed, in which the National Coal Board tabled a formula which offered the maximum allowed by Heath's \"Stage Three\" pay code, plus a further slice linked to productivity. This left no room at all for further negotiation from the National Coal Board 's side. But any hope that the miners' leader, [[Joe Gormley (trade unionist)|Joe Gormley]], could persuade his executive to accept it was ended by the machinations of his hard-Left colleague [[Mick McGahey]], who told Heath that he wanted to see the government fall. Although others have criticised the National Coal Board for offering the miners too much too soon, Boardman always defended them, believing that the legislation made that inevitable and that any concessions would have to be found outside the code. He was also clear that if the mineworkers were made a special case, other unions would have been forced to exploit it. He had in mind [[Frank Chapple]] at the [[EETPU]], who told him bluntly that, \"''if those buggers get a farthing more''\" than his own workers, he could stop the country in 48 hours. Boardman took part in the talks with the miners and he evidently impressed Heath.<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" /><ref name=\"The Independent\" />\n\nMeanwhile, war had broken out in the Middle East, and Arab oil producers had dramatically raised the price of oil. This strengthened the miners' hand, and in November they instigated an overtime ban. With both oil and coal supplies threatened, the government declared a [[State of Emergency]]. In an atmosphere of extreme tension, Boardman bore the brunt of administering the emergency measures, which involved a ban on non-essential uses of electricity and restrictions on heating in shops and offices.<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" />\n\nThere was also a plan to cut heating in schools. But the education secretary, [[Margaret Thatcher]], who had heard the news on a radio programme, had not been consulted. Furious, she stormed into Boardman's office. \"''After what the diplomats would describe as frank exchanges, [I] had it stopped'',\" she recalled in her memoirs.<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" />\n\nBoardman was admired for his calmness under fire. He reassured the public that power-station coal stocks would hold out through the winter; and, when a row broke out about possible petrol rationing, he played down his ministry's preparations as \"''purely administrative action \u2026 officials are looking to see whether the mice have eaten the ration books''\".<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" />\n\nHe was frequently called to [[Downing Street]] to take part in talks with leaders of the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]], and with representatives of the oil sheikdoms. And he set a widely appreciated example at the height of the shortages by exchanging his ministerial car for a smaller model. He also made a point of letting it be known that he had turned down the thermostat on his oil-fired central heating.<ref name=\"The Times\">{{cite news|title=Lord Boardman|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article2078254.ece|accessdate=26 February 2017|publisher=The Times|date=12 March 2003}}</ref>\n\nBoardman showed his steel when he refused the gas workers a court of inquiry over their industrial dispute against Stage II of the prices and incomes policy: \"''There is nothing to inquire into'',\" he told the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Commons]]. He ran energy policy during the first great oil shock until Heath, against the wishes of both Lord Peter Walker and Boardman, decided that there should be a new energy ministry.<ref name=\"The Independent\" />\n\nBoardman was a politician of charm and ability, noted for his loyalty and for the meticulousness with which he prepared his case and redrafted every statement or document emanating from his office. He was also a very patient listener to the problems of industry, at a time of soaring costs and shop floor militancy. His only fault, according to his ministerial boss, Lord Walker, was that \"''he worked too hard and worried too much \u2026 I had great difficulty in seeing that Tom got enough sleep and relaxation at weekends\"<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" /> \nHis success as a minister was confirmed by promotion to be [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]] in the dying days of the Heath government,<ref name=Guardian /><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=46229|page=2988|date=7 March 1974}}</ref> but a long career on the front bench was denied him by the defeat of the Government in the February 1974 election and the loss of his own seat to the Labour Party's [[Jim Marshall (British politician)|Jim Marshall]]. Boardman had been a well-liked and respected Member of Parliament, but, with his party doomed to opposition his mainstream political career came to an end.<ref name=\"The Independent\" />\n\n==Businessman==\n\nBoardman rejoined the [[Allied Breweries]] board in 1974, rising to vice-chairman the next year.<ref name=\"The Times\" />  He also became joint honorary treasurer of the Conservative Party, a post he held until 1982.<ref name=\"The Times\" /> He managed to buy the Tory central office site at Smith Square from Westminster council for \u00a31.32m - enabling it to be sold for three times the amount only two years later.<ref name=Guardian /> He was president of the [[British Chambers of Commerce|Association of British Chambers of Commerce]] for three years from 1977<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" /> and served on the council of the [[Confederation of British Industry]].<ref name=\"The Times\" />\n\nBoardman remained politically involved. Announced in the 1980 [[Birthday Honours]], he was created a [[life peer]] as Baron Boardman, of [[Welford, Northamptonshire|Welford]] in the County of Northamptonshire on 10 July 1980.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=48212|supp=y|page=1|date=13 June 1980}}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=48286|page=11941|date=22 August 1980}}</ref>\n\nIn 1978, Boardman became chairman of the building materials group Steetley Industries (he had been a director since 1975), the construction materials group.<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" /><ref name=\"The Times\" />\n\nIn 1979, Boardman joined the board of the National Westminster Bank and followed [[Robin Leigh-Pemberton, Baron Kingsdown|Lord Kingsdown]] (who became [[Governor of the Bank of England]]) into the chair in 1983. This was a period in which NatWest was overtaking [[Barclays]] to become the market leader in High Street banking, and pursuing grand ambitions, notably in investment banking and in [[North America]]. \"''Our philosophy is, and was, and remains that we are going to be a major player in the global market,''\" Boardman proclaimed in 1988<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" /> Changes at National Westminster during the Boardman era included returning to Saturday opening in 1985 after 16 years; waiving charges on current accounts in credit; becoming involved in the International Stock Exchange through the \u201cBig Bang\u201d deregulation of 1986; meeting the requirements of the 1986 [[Financial Services Act 1986|Financial Services Act]]; and taking over First Jersey National Corporation of the US. In 1988 National Westminster's shares were listed on the [[Tokyo stock exchange]] for the first time. Boardman's avowed technique was to support his management team without getting involved in day-to-day management.<ref name=\"The Times\" />\n\nIn his decade with what was then the biggest high street bank, Boardman helped make Natwest the country's most profitable and dynamic. Unhappily though, some of his subordinates cut corners, notably at County Natwest, whose handling of the Blue Arrow takeover of Manpower was savaged by inspectors at the Department of Trade and Industry - to Boardman's fury. Three top executives resigned, and Boardman stepped down three months early in 1989. Although not personally implicated in the fraud, and ignorant of any wrongdoing, Boardman chose to resign a few months before his term of office was due to end.<ref name=Guardian />\n\nBoardman was chairman of the committee of London & Scottish Clearing Bankers from 1987 in the last two years of a very successful term of office until his resignation from NatWest in 1989.<ref name=\"The Independent\" />  He was also a director of MEPC, the property company. In 1993, at the instigation of NatWest and other banks, he became chairman of [[Heron International]], the troubled property group created by [[Gerald Ronson]].<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" />\n\nIn retirement, Boardman was active in the House of Lords almost until his death. He found more time to enjoy his life in Welford, Northamptonshire. A skilled horseman, he had ridden in earlier days in military [[Steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechases]]. He hunted with the [[Pytchley Hunt|Pytchley]] until he was well into his seventies, retiring only when his faithful mount Bramble became too old to continue.<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" /> Boardman lived in Northamptonshire all his life, becoming [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of the county in 1977,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=47229|page=7145|date=2 June 1977}}</ref> and [[High Sheriff of Northamptonshire]] in 1979.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=47795|pages=3547\u20133548|date=16 March 1979}}</ref> He was awarded [[honorary doctorates]] by Nottingham and City universities.<ref name=\"The Times\" /> Among his many charitable works, Boardman was chairman of the national appeal for the [[Prince's Youth Trust|Prince's Youth Business Trust]].<ref name=\"The Times\" />\n\n==Legal significance==\nBoardman is also noteworthy in being the appellant in ''[[Boardman v Phipps]]'' [1967] 2 AC 46 ([[House of Lords]]) a leading case on fiduciary duty and [[Constructive trusts in English law|constructive trusts]].

He was educated at [[Bromsgrove School]] in [[Worcestershire]] (and later in life he became the \"President of the School\" from 1983 to 1994).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bromsgrovians.com/HistoryAndHeadmasters|title=The History and Headmasters of Bromsgrove School|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> His father was a landowner and [[Lord Mayor]] of [[Daventry]], who farmed 500 acres in [[Northamptonshire]].<ref name=Guardian>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/mar/12/guardianobituaries.conservatives|title=Lord Boardman|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=12 March 2003|accessdate=22 August 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"The Times\" /> Like many of his generation, Boardman\u2019s formative years were shaped by the increasingly real prospect of war. On leaving school, Boardman paid \u00a3500 to become an [[articled clerk]] with a local [[solicitor]], but in 1938, despite an early interest in the law and politics, enlisted into the [[British Army]] as a trooper in the 1st [[Northamptonshire Yeomanry]].<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" />\n\n==Military service==\n\nAt the start of the [[World War II]], Boardman was selected for training at the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], and commissioned as a [[Second Lieutenant]] on 14 September 1940.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=34950|supp=y|page=5632|date=20 September 1940}}</ref> He was promoted through the ranks to [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] and commanded the 1st Battalion [[Northamptonshire Yeomanry]] during the North West Europe campaign.<ref name=\"The Times\" /> He won the [[Military Cross]] (MC) in Normandy during [[Operation Overlord]], in the early part of the operation to trap German forces in the [[Falaise Pocket]].<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" />\n\nAfter the [[D-Day landings]] in 1944, Boardman was detailed to act as navigator for four armoured columns formed from the Northamptonshire Yeomanry, and [[Black Watch|1st Battalion Black Watch]]. The columns were to take [[Saint-Aignan-de-Cramesnil]], about 20 kilometres south of [[Caen]].<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" />\n\nOn 6 and 7 August 1944, Boardman conducted [[reconnaissance]] in [[no man's land]], despite German fire, to allow him to establish the route in darkness. In the night attack of 7/8 August, he then successfully spearheaded the columns forward through the Falaise Gap towards the village of St Aignan de Cramesnil, several times dismounting from his tank, and going back on foot to find parts of the columns which had lost touch. He had to illuminate the way forward with [[Very lights]], making himself a highly visible target for enemy fire. Having used all his flares, Boardman had to run back to the second tank in the column to find more, in so doing he almost fell into a slit trench full of Germans; but the objective was achieved.<ref name=\"The Telegraph\">{{cite news|title=Lord Boardman|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1424334/Lord-Boardman.html|accessdate=26 February 2017|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=12 March 2003}}</ref>\n\nOn 8 August 1944, [[Kurt Meyer]], of the [[SS Hitlerjugend Division]], ordered elements of his command to [[counterattack]] and recapture the high ground taken by [[the Allies (WWII)|The Allies]].{{sfn|Reid|2005|p=410}}{{sfn|Hart|2007|pp=52\u201369}} [[Michael Wittmann]] 'The Black Baron' a notable German [[Waffen-SS]] tank commander, led a group of seven [[Tiger I|Tiger tank]]s, from the Heavy SS-Panzer Battalion 101, supported by additional tanks and infantry. Boardman, with A Squadron 1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry, ambushed the Tigers crossing open terrain towards the high ground from the tree line.  It was Boardman's order to the gunner [[Joe Ekins]], which killed Wittman. According to the historian Hart, Boardman's unit was positioned in a wood on the right flank of the advancing Tiger tanks. At approximately 12:47, they engaged them, halting the attack, and killing Wittmann.{{sfn|Hart|2007|pp=60, 65}} Boardman's [[Squadron (army)|squadron]] (of which he was second in command) beat off the heavy counter-attack and the citation for his Military Cross gives much of the credit for this, and the destruction of 12 German tanks, to him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7705890|title=Documents Online\u2014Recommendations for Honours and Awards (Army)\u2014Image details: Boardman, Thomas Gray|accessdate=22 August 2008}}</ref> His MC was [[London Gazette|gazetted]] on 21 December 1944.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=36850|supp=y|pages=5854\u20135855|date=19 December 1944}}</ref>\n\nBoardman was later the [[Commanding Officer]] of the Northamptonshire Yeomanry, when they became part of the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]].<ref name=\"The Times\" />\n\n==Political Service==\n\nAt the end of the [[World War II]], Boardman took his law exams at Gibson & Wheldon (subsequently renamed [[The University of Law]])<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" />  and passed out top. He qualified and practised as a [[solicitor]] in [[Northampton]], and served on the boards of several companies; his sound judgment made him a valued contributor to business as director.<ref name=\"The Independent\" /> He became the Finance Director of [[Allied Breweries]] and, in 1958, he became chairman of Chamberlain Phipps, the [[Wellingborough]] manufacturer of adhesives, insulation, cladding and footwear components.<ref name=\"The Times\" /> He held this position until 1978.\n\nBoardman's interest in [[Conservative politics]] brought his adoption as the Conservative candidate for [[Leicester South-West]], where he fought [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour's]] [[Chief Whip]], [[Herbert Bowden]], in the 1964 and 1966 elections. Bowden was elevated to the [[House of Lords]] in 1967 and Boardman, at the age of 48, then won the parliamentary seat in a sensational [[by-election]] beating the Labour candidate Neville Sandelson and turning a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] majority into a Conservative majority of 3,939 (15.7 per cent).<ref name=\"The Independent\" />\n\nIt was a period of considerable Conservative success and Boardman consolidated his hold on the seat. In 1970, he beat off a fierce Labour challenge by just 106 votes.<ref name=\"The Independent\" />\n<ref name=\"Guardian\" /><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=45134|page=6946|date=23 June 1970}}</ref> By then, his fellow Conservatives had already elected him to the executive of the [[1922 Committee]] and he was chairman of the parliamentary panel of the [[Institute of Directors]]. Business commitments prevented him accepting the first government job offered to him, as [[Principal Private Secretary]] to [[Margaret Thatcher]].\n\nBoardman\u2019s skills had been rapidly recognised by the incoming Conservative government of [[Edward Heath]] in 1970. He quickly earned a reputation for speaking publicly only about subjects that he knew well, particularly in the realms of industry and commerce. In April 1972, he was made Minister for Industry at the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]], where he was seen by many as a powerful advocate of progress in industry.<ref name=\"The Times\" />  Heath brought Boardman in to help take forward the industrial expansion programme, in a reshuffle which followed the unveiling of the Industry Bill. This was Heath's notorious 'U-turn' on industrial policy, in which a free market approach was abandoned in favour of a return to intervention, subsidy for 'lame ducks' and price controls.<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" /><ref name=\"The Independent\">{{cite news|title=Lord Boardman|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/lord-boardman-36334.html|accessdate=26 February 2017|publisher=The Independent|date=12 March 2003}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Miners' strike|1972 miners' strike]], Boardman steered the Coal Industry Act through Parliament; it injected huge subsidies to keep the [[National Coal Board]] solvent. Having achieved a record pay award as part of that settlement, the miners were quiescent until the summer of 1973, when they demanded another 35 per cent.<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" />\n\nBoardman and his fellow junior minister, [[Peter Emery]], represented the government in the negotiations that followed, in which the National Coal Board tabled a formula which offered the maximum allowed by Heath's \"Stage Three\" pay code, plus a further slice linked to productivity. This left no room at all for further negotiation from the National Coal Board 's side. But any hope that the miners' leader, [[Joe Gormley (trade unionist)|Joe Gormley]], could persuade his executive to accept it was ended by the machinations of his hard-Left colleague [[Mick McGahey]], who told Heath that he wanted to see the government fall. Although others have criticised the National Coal Board for offering the miners too much too soon, Boardman always defended them, believing that the legislation made that inevitable and that any concessions would have to be found outside the code. He was also clear that if the mineworkers were made a special case, other unions would have been forced to exploit it. He had in mind [[Frank Chapple]] at the [[EETPU]], who told him bluntly that, \"''if those buggers get a farthing more''\" than his own workers, he could stop the country in 48 hours. Boardman took part in the talks with the miners and he evidently impressed Heath.<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" /><ref name=\"The Independent\" />\n\nMeanwhile, war had broken out in the Middle East, and Arab oil producers had dramatically raised the price of oil. This strengthened the miners' hand, and in November they instigated an overtime ban. With both oil and coal supplies threatened, the government declared a [[State of Emergency]]. In an atmosphere of extreme tension, Boardman bore the brunt of administering the emergency measures, which involved a ban on non-essential uses of electricity and restrictions on heating in shops and offices.<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" />\n\nThere was also a plan to cut heating in schools. But the education secretary, [[Margaret Thatcher]], who had heard the news on a radio programme, had not been consulted. Furious, she stormed into Boardman's office. \"''After what the diplomats would describe as frank exchanges, [I] had it stopped'',\" she recalled in her memoirs.<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" />\n\nBoardman was admired for his calmness under fire. He reassured the public that power-station coal stocks would hold out through the winter; and, when a row broke out about possible petrol rationing, he played down his ministry's preparations as \"''purely administrative action \u2026 officials are looking to see whether the mice have eaten the ration books''\".<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" />\n\nHe was frequently called to [[Downing Street]] to take part in talks with leaders of the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]], and with representatives of the oil sheikdoms. And he set a widely appreciated example at the height of the shortages by exchanging his ministerial car for a smaller model. He also made a point of letting it be known that he had turned down the thermostat on his oil-fired central heating.<ref name=\"The Times\">{{cite news|title=Lord Boardman|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article2078254.ece|accessdate=26 February 2017|publisher=The Times|date=12 March 2003}}</ref>\n\nBoardman showed his steel when he refused the gas workers a court of inquiry over their industrial dispute against Stage II of the prices and incomes policy: \"''There is nothing to inquire into'',\" he told the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Commons]]. He ran energy policy during the first great oil shock until Heath, against the wishes of both Lord Peter Walker and Boardman, decided that there should be a new energy ministry.<ref name=\"The Independent\" />\n\nBoardman was a politician of charm and ability, noted for his loyalty and for the meticulousness with which he prepared his case and redrafted every statement or document emanating from his office. He was also a very patient listener to the problems of industry, at a time of soaring costs and shop floor militancy. His only fault, according to his ministerial boss, Lord Walker, was that \"''he worked too hard and worried too much \u2026 I had great difficulty in seeing that Tom got enough sleep and relaxation at weekends\"<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" /> \nHis success as a minister was confirmed by promotion to be [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]] in the dying days of the Heath government,<ref name=Guardian /><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=46229|page=2988|date=7 March 1974}}</ref> but a long career on the front bench was denied him by the defeat of the Government in the February 1974 election and the loss of his own seat to the Labour Party's [[Jim Marshall (British politician)|Jim Marshall]]. Boardman had been a well-liked and respected Member of Parliament, but, with his party doomed to opposition his mainstream political career came to an end.<ref name=\"The Independent\" />\n\n==Businessman==\n\nBoardman rejoined the [[Allied Breweries]] board in 1974, rising to vice-chairman the next year.<ref name=\"The Times\" />  He also became joint honorary treasurer of the Conservative Party, a post he held until 1982.<ref name=\"The Times\" /> He managed to buy the Tory central office site at Smith Square from Westminster council for \u00a31.32m - enabling it to be sold for three times the amount only two years later.<ref name=Guardian /> He was president of the [[British Chambers of Commerce|Association of British Chambers of Commerce]] for three years from 1977<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" /> and served on the council of the [[Confederation of British Industry]].<ref name=\"The Times\" />\n\nBoardman remained politically involved. Announced in the 1980 [[Birthday Honours]], he was created a [[life peer]] as Baron Boardman, of [[Welford, Northamptonshire|Welford]] in the County of Northamptonshire on 10 July 1980.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=48212|supp=y|page=1|date=13 June 1980}}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=48286|page=11941|date=22 August 1980}}</ref>\n\nIn 1978, Boardman became chairman of the building materials group Steetley Industries (he had been a director since 1975), the construction materials group.<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" /><ref name=\"The Times\" />\n\nIn 1979, Boardman joined the board of the National Westminster Bank and followed [[Robin Leigh-Pemberton, Baron Kingsdown|Lord Kingsdown]] (who became [[Governor of the Bank of England]]) into the chair in 1983. This was a period in which NatWest was overtaking [[Barclays]] to become the market leader in High Street banking, and pursuing grand ambitions, notably in investment banking and in [[North America]]. \"''Our philosophy is, and was, and remains that we are going to be a major player in the global market,''\" Boardman proclaimed in 1988<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" /> Changes at National Westminster during the Boardman era included returning to Saturday opening in 1985 after 16 years; waiving charges on current accounts in credit; becoming involved in the International Stock Exchange through the \u201cBig Bang\u201d deregulation of 1986; meeting the requirements of the 1986 [[Financial Services Act 1986|Financial Services Act]]; and taking over First Jersey National Corporation of the US. In 1988 National Westminster\u2019s shares were listed on the [[Tokyo stock exchange]] for the first time. Boardman\u2019s avowed technique was to support his management team without getting involved in day-to-day management.<ref name=\"The Times\" />\n\nIn his decade with what was then the biggest high street bank, Boardman helped make Natwest the country's most profitable and dynamic. Unhappily though, some of his subordinates cut corners, notably at County Natwest, whose handling of the Blue Arrow takeover of Manpower was savaged by inspectors at the Department of Trade and Industry - to Boardman's fury. Three top executives resigned, and Boardman stepped down three months early in 1989. Although not personally implicated in the fraud, and ignorant of any wrongdoing, Boardman chose to resign a few months before his term of office was due to end.<ref name=Guardian />\n\nBoardman was chairman of the committee of London & Scottish Clearing Bankers from 1987 in the last two years of a very successful term of office until his resignation from NatWest in 1989.<ref name=\"The Independent\" />  He was also a director of MEPC, the property company. In 1993, at the instigation of NatWest and other banks, he became chairman of [[Heron International]], the troubled property group created by [[Gerald Ronson]].<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" />\n\nIn retirement, Boardman was active in the House of Lords almost until his death. He found more time to enjoy his life in Welford, Northamptonshire. A skilled horseman, he had ridden in earlier days in military [[Steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechases]]. He hunted with the [[Pytchley Hunt|Pytchley]] until he was well into his seventies, retiring only when his faithful mount Bramble became too old to continue.<ref name=\"The Telegraph\" /> Boardman lived in Northamptonshire all his life, becoming [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of the county in 1977,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=47229|page=7145|date=2 June 1977}}</ref> and [[High Sheriff of Northamptonshire]] in 1979.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=47795|pages=3547\u20133548|date=16 March 1979}}</ref> He was awarded [[honorary doctorates]] by Nottingham and City universities.<ref name=\"The Times\" /> Among his many charitable works, Boardman was chairman of the national appeal for the [[Prince's Youth Trust|Prince\u2019s Youth Business Trust]].<ref name=\"The Times\" />\n\n==Legal significance==\nBoardman is also noteworthy in being the appellant in ''[[Boardman v Phipps]]'' [1967] 2 AC 46 ([[House of Lords]]) a leading case on fiduciary duty and [[Constructive trusts in English law|constructive trusts]]. Although he was ultimately required to account to the trust for additional benefits that accrued from his actions, the courts commended him for the service he had delivered to the beneficiaries, to whom the court held he owed [[fiduciary duties]].

Joining the [[British Army]], he served in the [[Korean War]] with the [[Argyll & Sutherland Highlanders]]. On 7 August 1954, he married Diana Tuck, daughter of a Royal Navy captain; they had four children.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=wEFuRPsYHwwC&pg=PA1389&lpg=PA1389&dq=Diana++1954+%22George+Younger%22&source=bl&ots=rZAEZyvZcV&sig=Lh9qWuEHEAvbhpGNrfijIbqS1Vk&hl=en&ei=rhbAS7qWOoSJnQeg3Yz6CQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CBUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Diana%201954%20%22George%20Younger%22&f=false \"Entry for George Younger, 4th Viscount Younger of Leckie\" ''Burke's Landed Gentry of Great Britain'' p. 1389] 9 April 2010.</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nHe first stood for Parliament, unsuccessfully, in [[North Lanarkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North Lanarkshire]] in the [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959 general election]]. Subsequently, he was initially selected to stand for the [[Kinross and Western Perthshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Kinross and West Perthshire]] seat in a [[1963 Kinross and Western Perthshire by-election|by-election in late 1963]], but agreed to stand aside to allow the new Prime Minister [[Alec Douglas-Home]] the chance to enter the House of Commons.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of his great-grandfather the 1st Viscount, Younger became [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Ayr (UK Parliament constituency)|Ayr]] in [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964]] and served as Margaret Thatcher's [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] for seven years. He subsequently succeeded [[Michael Heseltine]] as [[Secretary of State for Defence]] in 1986 when Heseltine resigned from the cabinet over a dispute about helicopters known as the [[Westland affair]]. In the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]], as part of a considerable swing away from the Conservatives in Scotland, he retained his seat after three recounts, by a majority of just 182 votes (having been almost 8,000 votes in [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]]). Incidentally, it was held by his successor [[Phil Gallie]] by an even smaller majority of 85 votes in [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]].\n\n==Later years==\nYounger quit the cabinet in 1989, and joined the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], becoming its chairman in 1992. He  was created  a [[life peer]] as '''Baron Younger of Prestwick''', of [[Ayr]] in the District of [[Kyle and Carrick]], on 7 July 1992, five years before succeeding to the viscountcy. As such, he continued to sit in the [[House of Lords]] after the passage of the [[House of Lords Act 1999]] which expelled most of the [[hereditary peer]]s. Younger was Chancellor of Edinburgh's Napier University from 1993 until his death, and Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland for 2001-2002\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Torrance, David, ''The Scottish Secretaries'' (Birlinn 2006)\n*''Burke's Peerage & Baronetage'' (106th edition, 1999).

After being educated at the [[High School of Glasgow]] and the [[University of Glasgow]], he worked as a journalist on the ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|Glasgow Herald]]'' and was a [[Glasgow City Council]]lor from 1960. He fought [[Glasgow Springburn (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Springburn]] at the [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959 general election]], but he was beaten by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour's]] [[John Forman (British politician)|John Forman]].\n\n==Parliamentary career==\nHe first entered Parliament in the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 election]] as MP for [[Glasgow Cathcart (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Cathcart]], at the time being the [[Baby of the House]], as at 27 he was the youngest MP, although not for long as [[David Steel]] who was 26 entered Parliament five months later. He became a [[Scottish Office]] minister in [[Edward Heath]]'s government. He resigned from this position in July 1971 in protest at the UK joining the [[European Economic Community]]. Because of his strong personal following, he held onto the working-class Glasgow constituency of Cathcart, one of only two Conservative seats in Glasgow in the 1970s.\n\nHe was a controversial figure in his time in [[Scottish politics]], sometimes known as \"dial-a-quote\", or for his calls to bring back [[corporal punishment|the birch]] (which had been abolished in 1947). [[Brian Wilson (Labour politician)|Brian Wilson]], journalist and later Labour MP, wrote that calling him by a nice cuddly name like \"[[teddy bear|Teddy]]\" was \"like calling the [[The Hound of the Baskervilles|hound of the Baskervilles]] 'Rover.'\" As Opposition Front Bench Spokesman on Scottish Affairs, Taylor said in November 1974 that a general directive to the [[National Coal Board]] should follow the guidelines of the [[Social Contract (Britain)|Social Contract]] in any wage settlement. He said that the [[Labour government, 1974-1979|Labour government]] were being \"thoroughly cowardly and hypocritical over the Social Contract\" and asked the government spokesman in the House of Commons whether it was \"just a sick joke\". He was politically close to [[Margaret Thatcher]] and served as her [[Shadow Cabinet|Shadow]] [[Secretary of State for Scotland]]. \n\nWhilst Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, the Conservatives stood on a policy staunchly against [[History of Scottish devolution|Scottish devolution]]. Although Taylor strongly agreed with this, he knew and warned Mrs Thatcher that by standing on a platform against devolution, which Labour were promising for at the next election, that moderate [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] voters who favoured devolution but not necessarily independence would switch to [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], hence endangering Taylor's marginal seat, which he had held by 1,757 votes in [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]]. He was expected to become Thatcher's Secretary of State for Scotland if he had held his seat at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 election]]. 20 years later, during a Commons debate on devolution in 1999 at the prelude of the [[Scottish Parliament]], he said: \u201cUnfortunately, as I warned [[Margaret Thatcher|Lady Thatcher]], making the SNP vote disappear meant that the then Member of Parliament for Glasgow, Cathcart had to disappear as well. However, it was a good bargain for Scotland to get rid of the SNP and devolution, even if it meant that I had to go as well.\u201d<ref> https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1999/may/11/devolution#column_209</ref> In any case, he was back in Parliament within a year of his defeat, although he would never again serve in government.\n\n===Monday Club===\nHe was a leading and early (pre-1966) young member of the old [[Conservative Monday Club]], and was on the platform at the Club's very successfully rally at the Scottish Conservative Party's annual conference at [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] on 17 May 1968. He was first co-opted onto the Club's Executive Council on 9 September 1968. He is listed in a Club circular as one of its members standing for parliament in the General Election on 9 June 1983, for Southend East, and was elected deputy Chairman of the Club on 23 June that year. He consistently opposed the EEC and the EU and campaigned for the UK to leave. He was a leading campaigner against joining the euro and had also campaigned against metrication. Throughout his career he fought hard for the interests of British fishermen. On behalf of the Monday Club, in June 1974, he launched an attack on vandalism, saying in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that those who defaced public buildings with aerosol paint should be made to clean the buildings themselves.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nTaylor sought leave to introduce a bill in parliament in October 1974 to restore [[capital punishment]]. The following January, referring to the murder of a London policeman by a [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] gunman, he said that \"the answer was return of capital punishment\" and added that \"if the police want arms, no government could now refuse\". He was on the editorial board that prepared the Club's October 1985 Conservative Party Conference issue of their newspaper, ''Right Ahead'', to which he contributed a lengthy article entitled ''How Tories are Subsidising the Soviet War Machine''. In the mid-1980s he said, \"[[Nelson Mandela]] should be shot.\"<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/from-terrorist-to-tea-with-the-queen-1327902.html Nelson Mandela: From 'terrorist' to tea with the Queen], ''[[The Independent]]'', 9 July 1996</ref> On 30 March 1990, he was the guest speaker at the Club's Surrey branch 21st Anniversary Dinner and was still a Vice-President in 1992. He was guest-of-honour at the South East Essex Monday Club's Annual Dinner on 4 July 1997.\n\n===Change of seats===\nAt the 1979 election, Scotland bucked the British trend by showing a slight swing from Conservative to Labour, and Taylor lost his seat, the only Conservative MP at that election (other than by-election victors) to do so. He had been widely expected to become the [[Secretary of State for Scotland]]. Taylor re-entered Parliament at [[1980 Southend East by-election|a 1980 by-election]] for [[Southend East (UK Parliament constituency)|Southend East]] following the death of [[Stephen McAdden]] and then, from 1997, represented [[Rochford and Southend East]]. He did not serve in government after his return but received a [[knighthood]] in 1991.\n\nPrior to being selected to fight the Southend by-election, Taylor had been a candidate for the [[Rector of the University of Dundee|Rectorship]] of the [[University of Dundee]]. He was favourite to win but pulled out of the election at the last minute to contest the parliamentary seat.<ref name=Dundee>{{cite web|title=Rectorial Elections|url=http://archives-records-artefacts.blogspot.co.uk/2010/02/rectorial-elections.html|website=Archives, Records and Artefacts at the University of Dundee|publisher=University of Dundee|accessdate=8 December 2014|date=15 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[John Major]]'s government, he was one of the [[Maastricht Rebels]] and was temporarily expelled from the parliamentary party, although he was later reinstated. Taylor stood down at the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]].\n\n==Later life==\n\nIn 1994, Taylor made an idiosyncratic appearance on the [[BBC]] comedy panel show ''[[Have I Got News for You]]''. He appeared to be unaware of the light-hearted nature of the programme and so attempted to use it as a forum for serious political debate.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} He was interviewed in 2012 as part of [[The History of Parliament]]'s oral history project.<ref name='HoPTaylor'>{{cite web|title=Oral history: TAYLOR, Teddy|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/oral-history/member/taylor-teddy-1926|publisher=[[The History of Parliament]]|accessdate=14 July 2016}}</ref><ref name='BLTaylor'>{{cite web|title=Lord Taverne interviewed by Jason Lower|url=http://cadensa.bl.uk/uhtbin/cgisirsi/?ps=HwnXmJr70P/WORKS-FILE/190390041/9|publisher=[[British Library Sound Archive]]|accessdate=14 July 2016}}</ref>  Taylor  campaigned for a 'leave' vote in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]].<ref>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-41350209</ref>\n\nTaylor was a big fan of [[Bob Marley]].<Ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/if-sir-teddy-taylor-is-elected-to-no-10-the-walls-will-thump-to-the-bass-of-bob-marley-1307868.html</ref>\n\nTaylor died on 20 September 2017, having been ill for some months.

After being educated at the [[High School of Glasgow]] and the [[University of Glasgow]], he worked as a journalist on the ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|Glasgow Herald]]'' and was a [[Glasgow City Council]]lor from 1960. He fought [[Glasgow Springburn (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Springburn]] at the [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959 general election]], but he was beaten by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour's]] [[John Forman (British politician)|John Forman]].\n\n==Parliamentary career==\nHe first entered Parliament in the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 election]] as MP for [[Glasgow Cathcart (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Cathcart]], at the time being the [[Baby of the House]], as at 27 he was the youngest MP, although not for long as [[David Steel]] who was 26 entered Parliament five months later. He became a [[Scottish Office]] minister in [[Edward Heath]]'s government. He resigned from this position in July 1971 in protest at the UK joining the [[European Economic Community]]. Because of his strong personal following, he held onto the working-class Glasgow constituency of Cathcart, one of only two Conservative seats in Glasgow in the 1970s.\n\nHe was a controversial figure in his time in [[Scottish politics]], sometimes known as \"dial-a-quote\", or for his calls to bring back [[corporal punishment|the birch]] (which had been abolished in 1947). [[Brian Wilson (Labour politician)|Brian Wilson]], journalist and later Labour MP, wrote that calling him by a nice cuddly name like \"[[teddy bear|Teddy]]\" was \"like calling the [[The Hound of the Baskervilles|hound of the Baskervilles]] 'Rover.'\" As Opposition Front Bench Spokesman on Scottish Affairs, Taylor said in November 1974 that a general directive to the [[National Coal Board]] should follow the guidelines of the [[Social Contract (Britain)|Social Contract]] in any wage settlement. He said that the [[Labour government, 1974-1979|Labour government]] were being \"thoroughly cowardly and hypocritical over the Social Contract\" and asked the government spokesman in the House of Commons whether it was \"just a sick joke\". He was politically close to [[Margaret Thatcher]] and served as her [[Shadow Cabinet|Shadow]] [[Secretary of State for Scotland]]. \n\nWhilst Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, the Conservatives stood on a policy staunchly against [[History of Scottish devolution|Scottish devolution]]. Although Taylor strongly agreed with this, he knew and warned Mrs Thatcher that by standing on a platform against devolution, which Labour were promising for at the next election, that moderate [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] voters who favoured devolution but not necessarily independence would switch to [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], hence endangering Taylor\u2019s marginal seat, which he had held by 1,757 votes in [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]].

Cormack won with a majority of 1,529.\n\nPrior to 1970, Cormack was a member of the [[Bow Group]] and the [[Conservative Monday Club]], resigning from both at the end of 1971.<ref>Copping, Robert, ''The Story of The Monday Club \u2013 The First Decade'', Current Affairs Information Unit, London, April 1972: 21 & 28</ref>\n\n===Parliamentary career===\nFrom 1970\u201373, Cormack served as a [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to the [[Department of Health and Social Security]].

However, he was unsuccessful in his bid for the Speakership, with the House instead choosing Labour MP [[Michael Martin, Baron Martin of Springburn|Michael Martin]] for the role. During the 2005\u201310 parliament, Cormack was the chairman of the [[Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee]].\n\nThe vote in Staffordshire South was postponed at the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]] due to the death of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] candidate Jo Harrison.

In February 2007, it was announced that Cormack had failed to win the readoption of his constituency party for the next general election.

Being a trained biologist, he started to make animation with embalmed insects for educational purposes, but soon realized the possibilities of this medium to become one of the undisputed masters of [[stop motion]] later in his life. His first few films, made in 1910, were [[black comedy|dark comedies]] on the family lives of cockroaches, and were so revolutionary that they earned him a decoration from [[Nicholas II of Russia]]. He produced a number of other popular animated films with insects at the [[Aleksandr Khanzhonkov]]'s studio where he also worked as a cinematographer and a director of life-action films, sometimes combining life action with stop motion animation, as in ''[[The Night Before Christmas (1913 film)|The Night Before Christmas]]'' and ''A Terrible Vengeance'' (both from 1913).

In 1993 [[Yuriy Norshteyn]], [[Fyodor Khitruk]], [[Andrei Khrzhanovsky]] and [[Eduard Nazarov]] founded the [[SHAR Studio]] meant for training animators and producing films.<ref>[http://sharstudio.com/en/about/ About School-Studio \u201cSHAR\u201d] at the official site</ref> [[Garri Bardin]] also founded the Stayer animation studio where he continued directing claymation and stop motion films.<ref>[http://www.bardin.ru/engbiograph.htm Biography of the film director Garri Bardin] at the official site</ref> Others joined [[Pilot (studio)|Pilot]], [[Christmas Films]], [[Animation Magic]] and similar companies that lived on advertisement and commissioned works for big studios from Western countries.\n\nIn 1992 Films by Jove, an [[America]]n company ran by [[Oleg Vidov]] and his wife Joan Borsten, signed a nine-year contract with the new Soyuzmultfilm director Stanislav Rozhkov that gave them exclusive distribution and editing rights for the major part of the studio's collection. They were supposed to share incomes, but only after their expenses would've been paid off. As a result, animators received nothing for their past works. In 1993 they elected a new director, a shady businessman Sergei Skulyabin who promised to turn the studio into a [[joint-stock company]]. Instead he signed a new contract with Vidov, extending it from nine to twenty years and returning a number of non-profitable films. His plan was to sell exclusive rights for all past and future films to his [[dummy corporation]] and bankcrupt the studio.<ref name='fight'>Olga Razumovskaya.

Skulyabin also refused to leave the director's chair up until 30 June 1999 when [[Sergei Stepashin]] finally signed a long-awaited order that turned Soyuzmultfilm into a [[unitary enterprise]]. By that time the production completely stopped.<ref name='goodbye' /> In 2001 the [[Supreme Court of Arbitration of Russia]] returned the rights to the whole collection back to Soyuzmultfilm which led to a legal battle with Films by Jove. Only in 2007 Vidov and Borsten agreed to sell the collection to the Russian business magnate [[Alisher Usmanov]] who donated it to the state-run children's channel [[Bibigon]].<ref name='fight' /><ref>[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20070905006228/en/Films-Jove-Sells-Award-Winning-Animation-Library Films By Jove Sells Award Winning Animation Library Rights to Russian Magnate] article at [[Business Wire]], September 05, 2007</ref> Around the same time the studio came back to life.\n\nNevertheless, there were a few very successful international co-productions, e.g. the aforementioned ''[[Shakespeare: The Animated Tales]]'' and [[Aleksandr Petrov (animator)|Aleksandr Petrov]]'s [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[The Old Man and the Sea (1999 film)|The Old Man and the Sea]]'' (1999). An ambitious project in 12 series ''[[Dunno#Adaptations|Dunno on the Moon]]'' was released between 1997 and 1999. Based on the Soviet sci-fi [[Dunno on the Moon|novel of the same name]], it was produced at [[Aleksei Guskov]]'s F.A.F. Entertainment in the best traditions of Soviet hand-made animation. Despite the hardships, Natalya Lukinykh has estimated that Russian animated films won about twice as many prestigious international awards in the 1990s as Russian live-action films.<ref>Natalya Lukinykh.

While the Russian animation community is yet far from reaching the splendor it possessed before the end of the Soviet Union, a significant recovery is being made and it is becoming more and more clear that the revived Russian animation industry will be very different from what it was in the late 1980s.  According to [[Andrei Dobrunov]], head of Solnechny Dom, several Russian studios are currently working on some ten animated feature films.<ref>Anna Smolchenko.

Being a trained biologist, he started to make animation with embalmed insects for educational purposes, but soon realized the possibilities of this medium to become one of the undisputed masters of [[stop motion]] later in his life. His first few films, made in 1910, were [[black comedy|dark comedies]] on the family lives of cockroaches, and were so revolutionary that they earned him a decoration from [[Nicholas II of Russia]]. He produced a number of other popular animated films with insects at the [[Aleksandr Khanzhonkov]]'s studio where he also worked as a cinematographer and a director of life-action films, sometimes combining life action with stop motion animation, as in ''[[The Night Before Christmas (1913 film)|The Night Before Christmas]]'' and ''A Terrible Vengeance'' (both from 1913).
