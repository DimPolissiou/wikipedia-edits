Although all medicine based on [[science]] has some degree of [[empirical evidence|empirical]] support, EBM goes further, classifying evidence by its [[epistemology|epistemologic]] strength and requiring that only the strongest types (coming from [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]], [[systematic review]]s, and [[randomized controlled trial]]s) can yield strong recommendations; weaker types (such as from [[case-control study|case-control studies]]) can yield only weak recommendations. The term was originally used to describe an approach to teaching the practice of medicine and improving decisions by individual physicians about individual patients.<ref name=\"Guyatt\">{{cite journal |title=Evidence-based medicine.

It thus tries to assure that a [[clinician]]'s opinion, which may be limited by knowledge gaps or biases, is supplemented with all available knowledge from the [[scientific literature]] so that [[best practice]] can be determined and applied. It promotes the use of formal, explicit methods to analyze evidence and makes it available to decision makers. It promotes programs to teach the methods to medical students, practitioners, and policy makers.\n\n== Background, history and definition ==\nIn its broadest form, evidence-based medicine is the application of the scientific method into healthcare decision-making.

For example, the strongest evidence for therapeutic interventions is provided by systematic review of [[randomized]], well-blinded, [[placebo-controlled trials]] with allocation concealment and complete follow-up involving a homogeneous patient population and medical condition. In contrast, patient testimonials, [[Case report|case reports]], and even expert opinion (however, some critics have argued that expert opinion \"does not belong in the rankings of the quality of [[empirical evidence]] because it does not represent a form of empirical evidence\" and continue that \"expert opinion would seem to be a separate, complex type of knowledge that would not fit into hierarchies otherwise limited to empirical evidence alone\")<ref name=\"Tonelli99\">{{cite journal |author=Tonelli MR |title=In defense of expert opinion |journal=Acad Med |volume=74 |issue=11 |pages=1187\u201392 |date=November 1999 |pmid=10587679  |doi=10.1097/00001888-199911000-00010}}</ref> have little value as proof because of the placebo effect, the biases inherent in observation and reporting of cases, difficulties in ascertaining who is an expert and more.\n\nSeveral organizations have developed grading systems for assessing the quality of evidence. For example, in 1989 the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) put forth the following:<ref name=\"USPrevServTaskForce\">{{cite book|author=U.S. Preventive Services Task Force|title=Guide to clinical preventive services: report of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQGJHgI_dR8C&pg=PR24 |date=August 1989|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-1-56806-297-6|pages=24\u2013}}</ref>\n\n* Level I: Evidence obtained from at least one properly designed [[randomized controlled trial]].\n* Level II-1: Evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without [[randomization]].\n* Level II-2: Evidence obtained from well-designed [[Cohort study|cohort studies]] or [[case-control]] studies, preferably from more than one center or research group.\n* Level II-3: Evidence obtained from multiple [[time series]] designs with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled trials might also be regarded as this type of evidence.\n* Level III: Opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees.\n\nAnother example is the [[Oxford CEBM Levels of Evidence|Oxford (UK) CEBM Levels of Evidence]]. First released in September 2000, the Oxford CEBM Levels of Evidence provides 'levels' of evidence for claims about prognosis, diagnosis, treatment benefits, treatment harms, and screening, which most grading schemes do not address. The original CEBM Levels was Evidence-Based On Call to make the process of finding evidence feasible and its results explicit. In 2011, an international team redesigned the Oxford CEBM Levels to make it more understandable and to take into account recent developments in evidence ranking schemes. The Oxford CEBM Levels of Evidence have been used by patients, clinicians and also to develop clinical guidelines including recommendations for the optimal use of phototherapy and topical therapy in [[psoriasis]]<ref>{{cite web |last=OCEBM Levels of Evidence Working Group |title=The Oxford Levels of Evidence 2' |url = http://www.cebm.net/index.aspx?o=5653|date=May 2016}}</ref> and guidelines for the use of the BCLC staging system for diagnosing and monitoring [[hepatocellular carcinoma]] in Canada.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Paul |first1=C. |author2=Gallini, A. |author3=Archier, E. |title = Evidence-Based Recommendations on Topical Treatment and Phototherapy of Psoriasis: Systematic Review and Expert Opinion of a Panel of Dermatologists|journal=Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology|year=2012|volume=26 |issue=Suppl 3|pages=1\u201310|pmid=22512675 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-3083.2012.04518.x|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, a system was developed by the [[GRADE]] (short for Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) working group and takes into account more dimensions than just the quality of medical research.<ref name=\"GRADE\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/|title=Welcome to the GRADE working group|accessdate=2007-09-24|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207191324/http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/|archivedate=2006-02-07|url-status=live|website=www.gradeworkinggroup.org}}</ref> It requires users of GRADE  who are performing an assessment of the quality of evidence, usually as part of a systematic review, to consider the impact of different factors on their confidence in the results.

This suggests that a further increase will likely bring about more effect.\n\nMeaning of the levels of quality of evidence as per GRADE:<ref name=\"balshem2011\"/>\n* High Quality Evidence: The authors are very confident that the estimate that is presented lies very close to the true value. One could interpret it as \"there is very low probability of further research completely changing the presented conclusions.\"\n* Moderate Quality Evidence: The authors are confident that the presented estimate lies close to the true value, but it is also possible that it may be substantially different. One could also interpret it as: further research may completely change the conclusions.\n* Low Quality Evidence: The authors are not confident in the effect estimate and the true value may be substantially different. One could interpret it as \"further research is likely to change the presented conclusions completely.\"\n* Very low quality Evidence: The authors do not have any confidence in the estimate and it is likely that the true value is substantially different from it. One could interpret it as \"new research will most probably change the presented conclusions completely.\"\n\n===Categories of recommendations===\nIn guidelines and other publications, recommendation for a clinical service is classified by the balance of risk versus benefit and the level of evidence on which this information is based. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force uses:<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sherman|first=M|author2=Burak K|author3=Maroun J|title=Multidisciplinary Canadian Consensus Recommendations for the Management and Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma'|journal=Current Oncology|year=2012|volume=18|issue=5|pages=228\u201340|pmc=3185900|doi=10.3747/co.v18i5.952|pmid=21980250|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n* Level A: Good scientific evidence suggests that the benefits of the clinical service substantially outweigh the potential risks. Clinicians should discuss the service with eligible patients.\n* Level B: At least fair scientific evidence suggests that the benefits of the clinical service outweighs the potential risks. Clinicians should discuss the service with eligible patients.\n* Level C: At least fair scientific evidence suggests that there are benefits provided by the clinical service, but the balance between benefits and risks are too close for making general recommendations. Clinicians need not offer it unless there are individual considerations.\n* Level D: At least fair scientific evidence suggests that the risks of the clinical service outweighs potential benefits. Clinicians should not routinely offer the service to asymptomatic patients.\n* Level I: Scientific evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, such that the risk versus benefit balance cannot be assessed. Clinicians should help patients understand the uncertainty surrounding the clinical service.\n\nGRADE guideline panelists may make strong or weak recommendations on the basis of further criteria. Some of the important criteria are the balance between desirable and undesirable effects (not considering cost), the quality of the evidence, values and preferences and costs (resource utilization).<ref name=\"GRADE Handbook\"/>\n\nDespite the differences between systems, the purposes are the same: to guide users of clinical research information on which studies are likely to be most valid. However, the individual studies still require careful critical appraisal.\n\n===Statistical measures===\nEvidence-based medicine attempts to express clinical benefits of tests and treatments using mathematical methods. Tools used by practitioners of evidence-based medicine include:\n\n*Likelihood ratio {{main|Likelihood ratios in diagnostic testing}} The [[pre-test odds]] of a particular diagnosis, multiplied by the likelihood ratio, determines the [[pre- and post-test probability|post-test odds]]. (Odds can be calculated from, and then converted to, the [more familiar] probability.) This reflects [[Bayes' theorem]]. The differences in likelihood ratio between clinical tests can be used to prioritize clinical tests according to their usefulness in a given clinical situation.\n*AUC-ROC The area under the [[receiver operating characteristic]] curve (AUC-ROC) reflects the relationship between [[sensitivity and specificity]] for a given test. High-quality tests will have an AUC-ROC approaching 1, and high-quality publications about clinical tests will provide information about the AUC-ROC. Cutoff values for positive and negative tests can influence specificity and sensitivity, but they do not affect AUC-ROC.\n*[[Number needed to treat]] (NNT)/[[Number needed to harm]] (NNH). Number needed to treat or number needed to harm are ways of expressing the effectiveness and safety, respectively, of interventions in a way that is clinically meaningful. NNT is the number of people who need to be treated in order to achieve the desired outcome (e.g. survival from cancer) in one patient. For example, if a treatment increases the chance of survival by 5%, then 20 people need to be treated in order to have 1 additional patient survive due to the treatment. The concept can also be applied to diagnostic tests. For example, if 1339 women age 50\u201359 have to be invited for breast cancer screening over a ten-year period in order to prevent one woman from dying of breast cancer,<ref name=\"BandolierStatins2004\">\"Patient Compliance with statins\" ''[[Bandolier (journal)|Bandolier]] [http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/cardiac/patcomp.html Review] 2004  {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20150512021122/http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/cardiac/patcomp.html |date=2015-05-12 }}</ref> then the NNT for being invited to breast cancer screening is 1339.\n\n===Quality of clinical trials===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\nEvidence-based medicine attempts to objectively evaluate the quality of clinical research by critically assessing techniques reported by researchers in their publications.\n\n*Trial design considerations. High-quality studies have clearly defined eligibility criteria and have minimal missing data.\n*Generalizability considerations. Studies may only be applicable to narrowly defined patient populations and may not be generalizable to other clinical contexts.\n*Follow-up. Sufficient time for defined outcomes to occur can influence the prospective study outcomes and the [[statistical power]] of a study to detect differences between a treatment and control arm.\n*Power. A mathematical calculation can determine if the number of patients is sufficient to detect a difference between treatment arms. A negative study may reflect a lack of benefit, or simply a lack of sufficient quantities of patients to detect a difference.\n\n==Limitations and criticism==\nAlthough evidence-based medicine is regarded as the [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] of [[conventional medicine|clinical practice]], there are a number of limitations and criticisms of its use.<ref name=\"Krauss, Alexander. 2018\">{{cite journal|title=Why all randomised controlled trials produce biased results|journal = Annals of Medicine|volume = 50|issue = 4|pages = 312\u2013322|author=Krauss, Alexander |date=2018|doi = 10.1080/07853890.2018.1453233|pmid = 29616838|url = http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/87196/1/Krauss_Why-all-randomised.pdf}}</ref><ref name=\"Timmermans2005\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Timmermans S, Mauck A |title=The promises and pitfalls of evidence-based medicine |journal=Health Aff (Millwood) |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=18\u201328 |year=2005 |pmid=15647212 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.1.18 }}</ref> Two widely cited categorization schemes for the various published critiques of EBM include the three-fold division of Straus and McAlister (\"limitations universal to the practice of medicine, limitations unique to evidence-based medicine and misperceptions of evidence-based-medicine\")<ref name=\"Straus-McAlister-2000\">{{cite journal|last1=Straus|first1=SE|last2=McAlister|first2=FA|title=Evidence-based medicine: a commentary on common criticisms|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|date=3 October 2000|volume=163|issue=7|pages=837\u201341|pmid=11033714|url=http://www.cmaj.ca/content/163/7/837.full.pdf|pmc=80509}}</ref> and the five-point categorization of Cohen, Stavri and Hersh (EBM is a poor philosophic basis for medicine, defines evidence too narrowly, is not evidence-based, is limited in usefulness when applied to individual patients, or reduces the autonomy of the doctor/patient relationship).<ref name=\"Cohen-2004\">{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=AM|last2=Stavri|first2=PZ|last3=Hersh|first3=WR|title=A categorization and analysis of the criticisms of Evidence-Based Medicine|journal=International Journal of Medical Informatics|date=February 2004|volume=73|issue=1|pages=35\u201343|doi=10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2003.11.002|pmid=15036077|url=http://skynet.ohsu.edu/~hersh/ijmi-04-ebm.pdf|df=|citeseerx=10.1.1.586.3699}}{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nIn no particular order, some published objections include:\n\n* The theoretical ideal of EBM (that every narrow clinical question, of which hundreds of thousands can exist, would be answered by meta-analysis and systematic reviews of multiple RCTs) faces the limitation that research (especially the RCTs themselves) is expensive; thus, in reality, for the foreseeable future, there will always be much more demand for EBM than supply, and the best humanity can do is to triage the application of scarce resources.\n* Research produced by EBM, such as from [[randomized controlled trial]]s (RCTs), may not be relevant for all treatment situations.<ref name=\"pmid11489034\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Upshur RE, VanDenKerkhof EG, Goel V |title=Meaning and measurement: an inclusive model of evidence in health care |journal=J Eval Clin Pract |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=91\u201396 |date=May 2001 |pmid=11489034 |issn=1356-1294 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2753.2001.00279.x}}</ref> Research tends to focus on specific populations, but individual persons can vary substantially from population norms.

For example, the strongest evidence for therapeutic interventions is provided by systematic review of [[randomized]], well-blinded, [[placebo-controlled trials]] with allocation concealment and complete follow-up involving a homogeneous patient population and medical condition. In contrast, patient testimonials, [[Case report|case reports]], and even expert opinion (however, some critics have argued that expert opinion \"does not belong in the rankings of the quality of [[empirical evidence]] because it does not represent a form of empirical evidence\" and continue that \"expert opinion would seem to be a separate, complex type of knowledge that would not fit into hierarchies otherwise limited to empirical evidence alone\")<ref name=\"Tonelli99\">{{cite journal |author=Tonelli MR |title=In defense of expert opinion |journal=Acad Med |volume=74 |issue=11 |pages=1187\u201392 |date=November 1999 |pmid=10587679  |doi=10.1097/00001888-199911000-00010}}</ref> have little value as proof because of the placebo effect, the biases inherent in observation and reporting of cases, difficulties in ascertaining who is an expert and more.\n\nSeveral organizations have developed grading systems for assessing the quality of evidence. For example, in 1989 the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) put forth the following:<ref name=\"USPrevServTaskForce\">{{cite book|author=U.S. Preventive Services Task Force|title=Guide to clinical preventive services: report of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQGJHgI_dR8C&pg=PR24 |date=August 1989|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-1-56806-297-6|pages=24\u2013}}</ref>\n\n* Level I: Evidence obtained from at least one properly designed [[randomized controlled trial]].\n* Level II-1: Evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without [[randomization]].\n* Level II-2: Evidence obtained from well-designed [[Cohort study|cohort studies]] or [[case-control]] studies, preferably from more than one center or research group.\n* Level II-3: Evidence obtained from multiple [[time series]] designs with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled trials might also be regarded as this type of evidence.\n* Level III: Opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees.\n\nAnother example is the [[Oxford CEBM Levels of Evidence|Oxford (UK) CEBM Levels of Evidence]]. First released in September 2000, the Oxford CEBM Levels of Evidence provides 'levels' of evidence for claims about prognosis, diagnosis, treatment benefits, treatment harms, and screening, which most grading schemes do not address. The original CEBM Levels was Evidence-Based On Call to make the process of finding evidence feasible and its results explicit. In 2011, an international team redesigned the Oxford CEBM Levels to make it more understandable and to take into account recent developments in evidence ranking schemes. The Oxford CEBM Levels of Evidence have been used by patients, clinicians and also to develop clinical guidelines including recommendations for the optimal use of phototherapy and topical therapy in [[psoriasis]]<ref>{{cite web |last=OCEBM Levels of Evidence Working Group |title=The Oxford Levels of Evidence 2' |url = http://www.cebm.net/index.aspx?o=5653|date=May 2016}}</ref> and guidelines for the use of the BCLC staging system for diagnosing and monitoring [[hepatocellular carcinoma]] in Canada.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Paul |first1=C. |author2=Gallini, A. |author3=Archier, E. |title = Evidence-Based Recommendations on Topical Treatment and Phototherapy of Psoriasis: Systematic Review and Expert Opinion of a Panel of Dermatologists|journal=Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology|year=2012|volume=26 |issue=Suppl 3|pages=1\u201310|pmid=22512675 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-3083.2012.04518.x|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, a system was developed by the [[GRADE]] (short for Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) working group and takes into account more dimensions than just the quality of medical research.<ref name=\"GRADE\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/|title=Welcome to the GRADE working group|accessdate=2007-09-24|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207191324/http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/|archivedate=2006-02-07|url-status=live|website=www.gradeworkinggroup.org}}</ref> It requires users of GRADE  who are performing an assessment of the quality of evidence, usually as part of a systematic review, to consider the impact of different factors on their confidence in the results.

This suggests that a further increase will likely bring about more effect.\n\nMeaning of the levels of quality of evidence as per GRADE:<ref name=\"balshem2011\"/>\n* High Quality Evidence: The authors are very confident that the estimate that is presented lies very close to the true value. One could interpret it as \"there is very low probability of further research completely changing the presented conclusions.\"\n* Moderate Quality Evidence: The authors are confident that the presented estimate lies close to the true value, but it is also possible that it may be substantially different. One could also interpret it as: further research may completely change the conclusions.\n* Low Quality Evidence: The authors are not confident in the effect estimate and the true value may be substantially different. One could interpret it as \"further research is likely to change the presented conclusions completely.\"\n* Very low quality Evidence: The authors do not have any confidence in the estimate and it is likely that the true value is substantially different from it. One could interpret it as \"new research will most probably change the presented conclusions completely.\"\n\n===Categories of recommendations===\nIn guidelines and other publications, recommendation for a clinical service is classified by the balance of risk versus benefit and the level of evidence on which this information is based. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force uses:<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sherman|first=M|author2=Burak K|author3=Maroun J|title=Multidisciplinary Canadian Consensus Recommendations for the Management and Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma'|journal=Current Oncology|year=2012|volume=18|issue=5|pages=228\u201340|pmc=3185900|doi=10.3747/co.v18i5.952|pmid=21980250|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n* Level A: Good scientific evidence suggests that the benefits of the clinical service substantially outweigh the potential risks. Clinicians should discuss the service with eligible patients.\n* Level B: At least fair scientific evidence suggests that the benefits of the clinical service outweighs the potential risks. Clinicians should discuss the service with eligible patients.\n* Level C: At least fair scientific evidence suggests that there are benefits provided by the clinical service, but the balance between benefits and risks are too close for making general recommendations. Clinicians need not offer it unless there are individual considerations.\n* Level D: At least fair scientific evidence suggests that the risks of the clinical service outweighs potential benefits. Clinicians should not routinely offer the service to asymptomatic patients.\n* Level I: Scientific evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, such that the risk versus benefit balance cannot be assessed. Clinicians should help patients understand the uncertainty surrounding the clinical service.\n\nGRADE guideline panelists may make strong or weak recommendations on the basis of further criteria. Some of the important criteria are the balance between desirable and undesirable effects (not considering cost), the quality of the evidence, values and preferences and costs (resource utilization).<ref name=\"GRADE Handbook\"/>\n\nDespite the differences between systems, the purposes are the same: to guide users of clinical research information on which studies are likely to be most valid. However, the individual studies still require careful critical appraisal.\n\n===Statistical measures===\nEvidence-based medicine attempts to express clinical benefits of tests and treatments using mathematical methods. Tools used by practitioners of evidence-based medicine include:\n\n*Likelihood ratio {{main|Likelihood ratios in diagnostic testing}} The [[pre-test odds]] of a particular diagnosis, multiplied by the likelihood ratio, determines the [[pre- and post-test probability|post-test odds]]. (Odds can be calculated from, and then converted to, the [more familiar] probability.) This reflects [[Bayes' theorem]]. The differences in likelihood ratio between clinical tests can be used to prioritize clinical tests according to their usefulness in a given clinical situation.\n*AUC-ROC The area under the [[receiver operating characteristic]] curve (AUC-ROC) reflects the relationship between [[sensitivity and specificity]] for a given test. High-quality tests will have an AUC-ROC approaching 1, and high-quality publications about clinical tests will provide information about the AUC-ROC. Cutoff values for positive and negative tests can influence specificity and sensitivity, but they do not affect AUC-ROC.\n*[[Number needed to treat]] (NNT)/[[Number needed to harm]] (NNH). Number needed to treat or number needed to harm are ways of expressing the effectiveness and safety, respectively, of interventions in a way that is clinically meaningful. NNT is the number of people who need to be treated in order to achieve the desired outcome (e.g. survival from cancer) in one patient. For example, if a treatment increases the chance of survival by 5%, then 20 people need to be treated in order to have 1 additional patient survive due to the treatment. The concept can also be applied to diagnostic tests. For example, if 1339 women age 50\u201359 have to be invited for breast cancer screening over a ten-year period in order to prevent one woman from dying of breast cancer,<ref name=\"BandolierStatins2004\">\"Patient Compliance with statins\" ''[[Bandolier (journal)|Bandolier]] [http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/cardiac/patcomp.html Review] 2004  {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20150512021122/http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/cardiac/patcomp.html |date=2015-05-12 }}</ref> then the NNT for being invited to breast cancer screening is 1339.\n\n===Quality of clinical trials===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\nEvidence-based medicine attempts to objectively evaluate the quality of clinical research by critically assessing techniques reported by researchers in their publications.\n\n*Trial design considerations. High-quality studies have clearly defined eligibility criteria and have minimal missing data.\n*Generalizability considerations. Studies may only be applicable to narrowly defined patient populations and may not be generalizable to other clinical contexts.\n*Follow-up. Sufficient time for defined outcomes to occur can influence the prospective study outcomes and the [[statistical power]] of a study to detect differences between a treatment and control arm.\n*Power. A mathematical calculation can determine if the number of patients is sufficient to detect a difference between treatment arms. A negative study may reflect a lack of benefit, or simply a lack of sufficient quantities of patients to detect a difference.\n\n==Limitations and criticism==\nAlthough evidence-based medicine is regarded as the [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] of [[conventional medicine|clinical practice]], there are a number of limitations and criticisms of its use.<ref name=\"Krauss, Alexander. 2018\">{{cite journal|title=Why all randomised controlled trials produce biased results|journal = Annals of Medicine|volume = 50|issue = 4|pages = 312\u2013322|author=Krauss, Alexander |date=2018|doi = 10.1080/07853890.2018.1453233|pmid = 29616838|url = http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/87196/1/Krauss_Why-all-randomised.pdf}}</ref><ref name=\"Timmermans2005\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Timmermans S, Mauck A |title=The promises and pitfalls of evidence-based medicine |journal=Health Aff (Millwood) |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=18\u201328 |year=2005 |pmid=15647212 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.1.18 }}</ref> Two widely cited categorization schemes for the various published critiques of EBM include the three-fold division of Straus and McAlister (\"limitations universal to the practice of medicine, limitations unique to evidence-based medicine and misperceptions of evidence-based-medicine\")<ref name=\"Straus-McAlister-2000\">{{cite journal|last1=Straus|first1=SE|last2=McAlister|first2=FA|title=Evidence-based medicine: a commentary on common criticisms|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|date=3 October 2000|volume=163|issue=7|pages=837\u201341|pmid=11033714|url=http://www.cmaj.ca/content/163/7/837.full.pdf|pmc=80509}}</ref> and the five-point categorization of Cohen, Stavri and Hersh (EBM is a poor philosophic basis for medicine, defines evidence too narrowly, is not evidence-based, is limited in usefulness when applied to individual patients, or reduces the autonomy of the doctor/patient relationship).<ref name=\"Cohen-2004\">{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=AM|last2=Stavri|first2=PZ|last3=Hersh|first3=WR|title=A categorization and analysis of the criticisms of Evidence-Based Medicine|journal=International Journal of Medical Informatics|date=February 2004|volume=73|issue=1|pages=35\u201343|doi=10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2003.11.002|pmid=15036077|url=http://skynet.ohsu.edu/~hersh/ijmi-04-ebm.pdf|df=|citeseerx=10.1.1.586.3699}}{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nIn no particular order, some published objections include:\n\n* The theoretical ideal of EBM (that every narrow clinical question, of which hundreds of thousands can exist, would be answered by meta-analysis and systematic reviews of multiple RCTs) faces the limitation that research (especially the RCTs themselves) is expensive; thus, in reality, for the foreseeable future, there will always be much more demand for EBM than supply, and the best humanity can do is to triage the application of scarce resources.\n* Research produced by EBM, such as from [[randomized controlled trial]]s (RCTs), may not be relevant for all treatment situations.<ref name=\"pmid11489034\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Upshur RE, VanDenKerkhof EG, Goel V |title=Meaning and measurement: an inclusive model of evidence in health care |journal=J Eval Clin Pract |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=91\u201396 |date=May 2001 |pmid=11489034 |issn=1356-1294 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2753.2001.00279.x}}</ref> Research tends to focus on specific populations, but individual persons can vary substantially from population norms.

Mike Dillard, a steelworker, talks about the dangers of his job. Some people get caught in a (Traffic Jam) on the highway. Some of the cars stop at an office building where Al Calinda, a parking lot attendant is working. He parks the cars and states that he has been parking cars his whole life, and probably will for the rest of his life (Lovin Al). On top of the parking lot there is an office building. Amanda McKenny is  displeased that people stereotype her with her job. She has a strained relationship with her boss, Rex Winship, who tells us he wants to be a teacher. Rose Hoffman, a teacher who has one year left until retirement, is unhappy with the changes she sees in the school system (Nobody Tells Me How). She remembers a student of hers, Babe Secoli, who is now a checker at the Treasure Island Supermarket. Babe explains that her job requires work from every part of the body (I'm Just Movin). Her bag boy, Roberto Nunez, is unhappy with the music that is playing in the market, which is the Cuban Revolution celebratory song along with  the hardships of working on a farm and hopes a better day will come (Un Mejor Dia Vendra). In the neighborhood, Conrad Swibel is on his UPS delivery route, talking about the perks of his job: meeting women, and the bad parts, getting chased by dogs. After he leaves, John Rushton delivers the newspaper and tells of his dreams for the future (Neat to be a Newsboy). His mother, Kate Rushton, a housewife, who complains that people doubt her intelligence because she chooses to stay at home and look after her family (Just a Housewife). Candy Cottingham says that she needs to separate people from their jobs for her job as a political fundraiser. Grace Clements explains that she does not want to see any young people doing her job as a millworker because of the physical stress on the body (Millwork). As evening rolls in, all the workers remember their dreams of old (If I Could've Been).\n\n;Act 2\n\nAnthony Coelho likes his job because in a hundred years people will still see his work (The Mason). On the highway, Frank Decker and Dave are driving their truck (Brother Trucker). Frank explains that he barely sees his family because of his schedule.

Dolores Dante loves her job and is proud to be a waitress (It's an Art). At the park Joe Zutty, a retired man, talks about his life (Joe). He spends his days as a volunteer firefighter. Tom Patrick, who also works as a firefighter, gets emotional talking about the lives he saved. Maggie Holmes talks about wanting a better life for her daughter (Cleanin' Woman).
