'''Metal Planet Music''' voiced that \"the first thing that strikes you is the music, great hard rock with melody and class, but it\u2019s the heart and emotion that will stay with you long after the last note rings out. Coming eight years after their debut, \u2018'''''The Burning'''''\u2019 is the second album by [[British Lion (Band)|British Lion]] and the [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] led quintet have made a record that is at once modern, nostalgic and timeless\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metalplanetmusic.com/2020/01/gig-review-british-lion-the-burning/|title=Album Review : British Lion \u2013 \u2018The Burning|last=Authoradmin|date=2020-01-22|website=Metal Planet Music|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n[[Kerrang!]] mainly spoke upon the vocals of the album stating that \"the band\u2019s debut was rather a baptism of fire for singer '''Richard Taylor''', who had to weather some predictable yet redundant criticisms comparing him to [[Bruce Dickinson]] from Steve\u2019s \u201cother\u201d band. He sings like he has a point to prove throughout '''''The Burning'''''. A telling sign of the frontman\u2019s burgeoning confidence comes on '''Elysium''' \u2013 a song that boasts a killer chorus but an even better final passage, as he belts out a series of absolutely massive sustained notes over a swelling choral section. Equally impressive is his ability to extract emotion from a song. Whether he\u2019s communing with lost souls on '''Lightning''' or offering a consolatory ear on closer '''Native Son''', he often brings a moving sense of fragility to the fore. Clearly, this particular lion has more at its disposal than claws alone\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kerrang.com/reviews/album-review-british-lion-the-burning/|title=Album Review: British Lion \u2013 The Burning|website=Kerrang!|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] rated the album a 4/5, and believes \"'''''The Burning''''' sounds vastly more punchy and powerful than its predecessor, while also giving the distinct impression that '''British Lion''' have evolved into a fiery and characterful ensemble with a strong identity of their own\". The review continued by stating that \"we are still firmly in traditional rock territory here, and [[Steve Harris (musician)|Harris]]\u2019s love of [[UFO (band)|UFO]] and [[Golden Earring]] remains as cheerfully conspicuous as ever, but thanks to a brighter, breezier sound and unmistakable hints of looseness and swagger, everything from the briskly uplifting title track to the brooding hulk of '''Bible Black''' sparkles with freshness and weirdly youthful vigour\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/british-lion-arrys-other-army-return-on-sizzling-form|title=British Lion: \u2018Arry\u2019s other army return on sizzling form|last=January 2020|first=Dom Lawson 17|website=Classic Rock Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n'''Metal Temple''' deemed the album a 9/10 saying '''\"''The Burning''\"''' is just what a sophomore album should be. A continuation, with enthusiasm, growth and development. [[Steve Harris (musician)|Harris]] is his usual subdued bass thumping brilliance. '''Hawkins''' and '''Leslie's''' dual guitar attack is on point, '''Dawson's''' drums precise and well deftly executed. '''Taylor's''' vocals add a final layer of confidence to the formula that seals the deal.

'''Metal Planet Music''' voiced that \"the first thing that strikes you is the music, great hard rock with melody and class, but it\u2019s the heart and emotion that will stay with you long after the last note rings out. Coming eight years after their debut, \u2018'''''The Burning'''''\u2019 is the second album by [[British Lion (Band)|British Lion]] and the [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] led quintet have made a record that is at once modern, nostalgic and timeless\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metalplanetmusic.com/2020/01/gig-review-british-lion-the-burning/|title=Album Review : British Lion \u2013 \u2018The Burning|last=Authoradmin|date=2020-01-22|website=Metal Planet Music|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n[[Kerrang!]] mainly spoke upon the vocals of the album stating that \"the band\u2019s debut was rather a baptism of fire for singer '''Richard Taylor''', who had to weather some predictable yet redundant criticisms comparing him to [[Bruce Dickinson]] from Steve\u2019s \u201cother\u201d band. He sings like he has a point to prove throughout '''''The Burning'''''. A telling sign of the frontman\u2019s burgeoning confidence comes on '''Elysium''' \u2013 a song that boasts a killer chorus but an even better final passage, as he belts out a series of absolutely massive sustained notes over a swelling choral section. Equally impressive is his ability to extract emotion from a song. Whether he\u2019s communing with lost souls on '''Lightning''' or offering a consolatory ear on closer '''Native Son''', he often brings a moving sense of fragility to the fore. Clearly, this particular lion has more at its disposal than claws alone\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kerrang.com/reviews/album-review-british-lion-the-burning/|title=Album Review: British Lion \u2013 The Burning|website=Kerrang!|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] rated the album a 4/5, and believes \"'''''The Burning''''' sounds vastly more punchy and powerful than its predecessor, while also giving the distinct impression that '''British Lion''' have evolved into a fiery and characterful ensemble with a strong identity of their own\". The review continued by stating that \"we are still firmly in traditional rock territory here, and [[Steve Harris (musician)|Harris]]\u2019s love of [[UFO (band)|UFO]] and [[Golden Earring]] remains as cheerfully conspicuous as ever, but thanks to a brighter, breezier sound and unmistakable hints of looseness and swagger, everything from the briskly uplifting title track to the brooding hulk of '''Bible Black''' sparkles with freshness and weirdly youthful vigour\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/british-lion-arrys-other-army-return-on-sizzling-form|title=British Lion: \u2018Arry\u2019s other army return on sizzling form|last=January 2020|first=Dom Lawson 17|website=Classic Rock Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n'''Metal Temple''' deemed the album a 9/10 saying '''\u201c''The Burning''\u201d''' is just what a sophomore album should be. A continuation, with enthusiasm, growth and development. [[Steve Harris (musician)|Harris]] is his usual subdued bass thumping brilliance. '''Hawkins''' and '''Leslie's''' dual guitar attack is on point, '''Dawson's''' drums precise and well deftly executed. '''Taylor's''' vocals add a final layer of confidence to the formula that seals the deal. '''British Lion's \u201c''The Burning''\u201d''' is refreshing in it's telling of the story, and hints of even better tales in the future.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metal-temple.com/site/catalogues/entry/reviews/cd_3/b_2/british-lion-the.htm|title=Metal-Temple.com :: British Lion \u2013 The Burning (CD Review)|last=bkarr272|website=www.metal-temple.com|language=EN|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n'''KNAC''' stated that \"good things come to those who wait\". \"'''''The Burning''''' is a molten magma of soaring and even syncopated vocals that hover over sometimes haunting neo-Celtic melodies and sometimes epic, wistful and melancholic lyrical themes\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=35238|title=British Lion - The Burning album review|last=|first=|date=|website=KNAC.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=15/04/2020}}</ref>\n\n=[[British Lion (Band)|British Lion Band]]=\nFollowing the initial announcement of the album's release in July 2012, ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' revealed that the project originated with a band, named [[British Lion (Band)|British Lion]], which Harris had been mentoring in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/maidens-harris-announces-solo-album/ |title=Maiden's Harris announces solo album |accessdate=8 September 2012 |last=Kielty |first=Martin |date=18 July 2012 |magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130119104531/http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/maidens-harris-announces-solo-album/ |archivedate=19 January 2013 }}</ref> Harris confirmed this during an interview with ''Classic Rock'' the following month, explaining that he became involved after \"Graham Leslie [guitar] came to me with a cassette of songs... and I thought they were really good, so I said I\u2019d try to help his band do something.

In 1984, the [[Israeli Central Elections Committee]] banned him from being a candidate on the grounds that Kach was a racist party, but the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] overturned the ban on the grounds that the committee was not authorized to ban Kahane's candidacy.<ref>Israel Court Drops Ban on 2 Political Parties, New York Times, June 29, 1984, p. 3</ref> The Supreme Court suggested that the Knesset pass a law excluding racist parties from future elections. The Knesset responded in 1985 by amending the \"Basic Law:Knesset\" to include a prohibition (paragraph 7a) against registration of parties that explicitly or implicitly incite racism.\n\n=== Election to Knesset ===\nIn the [[1984 Israeli legislative election|1984 legislative elections]], Kahane's Kach party received 25,907 votes, gaining one seat in the Knesset, which was taken by Kahane. He refused to take the standard [[oath of office]] and insisted on adding a Biblical verse from [[Psalms]] to indicate that national laws were overruled by the [[Torah]] if they conflict. Kahane's legislative proposals focused on Jewish education, an open economy, transferring the Arab population out of the [[Land of Israel]], revoking Israeli citizenship from non-Jews, and banning Jewish-Gentile marriages and sexual relations. \n\nWhile his popularity in Israel grew, Kahane was boycotted in the Knesset, where his speeches were often made to an assembly that was empty except for the duty chairman and the transcriptionist. Kahane's legislative proposals and motions of no-confidence against the government were ignored or rejected. Kahane often pejoratively called other Knesset members \"[[Hellenistic|Hellenists]], a reference to Jews who assimilated into [[Greek culture]] after [[Judea]]'s occupation by [[Alexander the Great]]. In 1987, Kahane opened a [[yeshiva]] (\"HaRaayon HaYehudi\") with funding from US supporters to teach \"the Authentic Jewish Idea\". Despite the boycott, his popularity grew among the Israeli public, especially for working-class [[Sephardi Jews]].<ref name=\"cut down\">[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20113657,00.html After a Career of Preaching Hatred for Arabs, Rabbi Meir Kahane Is Cut Down by An Assassin's Bullet] People Magazine</ref> Polls showed that Kach would have likely received anywhere from four to twelve seats in the coming November 1988 elections.<ref>[http://www.washington-report.org/backissues/0799/9907081.html Jewish Defense League Unleashes Campaign of Violence in America] New York Times, October 17, 1988</ref><ref>{{Google books |id=6iHOrDQghpcC |page=196 |title=Jew vs. Jew: the struggle for the soul of American Jewry }}, Samuel G.

The Central Elections Committee banned Kahane a second time, and he appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court. However, the Supreme Court this time ruled in favor of the committee, disqualifying Kach from running in the [[1988 Israeli legislative election|1988 legislative elections]]. Kahane was thus the first candidate in Israel to be barred from election for racism. The move was criticized as being anti-democratic by [[Alan M.

As a result of this legislation, Kahane renounced his United States citizenship. Following his banning from the Knesset, he tried to get his U.S. citizenship reinstated on the basis of the fact that he was compelled to relinquish it by the Knesset. It was not reinstated, but he was permitted to continue traveling to the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/immigrationlaw/chapter12.html |title=Concepts of Citizenship  |author=Weissbrodt, David and Danielson, Laura |date=2004 |website=University of Minnesota Human Rights Library  |publisher= |access-date=July 28, 2019|quote=Kahane was a U.S. citizen at birth.

Kahane, aware of the fact that accepting an office under a foreign government was an expatriating act listed in INA 349 (a)(4), communicated on several occasions with the State Department that he did not intend to give up his U.S. citizenship. The State Department nonetheless claimed that Kahane committed the expatriating act by shifting his allegiance to Israel. The court rejected this argument because an actor who contemporaneously with the expatriating act declares his intent to stay a U.S. citizen automatically preserves his citizenship. Kahane v. Shultz (E.D.N.Y.1987). One year later, the Israeli Parliament passed a law providing that its members could only be Israeli citizens. Kahane executed a formal oath of renunciation of his U.S. citizenship to remain eligible for a seat in the Parliament. After Kahane's party was barred, on different grounds, from running in the elections, Kahane tried to revoke his renunciation of U.S. citizenship claiming that the Israeli law compelled his act.

The objective of Judaism is to serve God and to make people better. These are two totally opposite conceptions of life.\"{{cite web|url=http://kahane.org/meir/interview.htm |title=God's Law: an Interview with Rabbi Meir Kahane |accessdate=December 18, 2012 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219141224/http://kahane.org/meir/interview.htm |archivedate=February 19, 2009}}</ref> Kahane also stressed the view that a Jewish state and a Western democracy were incompatible, since Western democracy is religion-blind, and a Jewish state is religion-oriented by its very name. He also warned of the danger of non-Jewish citizens becoming a majority and voting against the Jewish character of the state: \"The question is as follows: if the Arabs settle among us and make enough children to become a majority, will Israel continue to be a Jewish state? Do we have to accept that the Arab majority will decide?\"<ref name=\"kahane.org\">Kahane.org</ref> \"Western democracy has to be ruled out. For me, that's cut and dried: There's no question of setting up democracy in Israel, because democracy means equal rights for all, irrespective of racial or religious origins.\"\n\nKahane proposed an \"[[population transfer|exchange of populations]]\" that would continue the [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands]]: \"A total of some 750,000 Jews fled Arab lands since 1948. Surely it is time for Jews, worried over the huge growth of Arabs in Israel, to consider finishing the exchange of populations that began 35 years ago.\" Kahane proposed a $40,000 compensation plan for Arabs who would leave voluntarily, and forcible expulsion for those who \"don't want to leave\".<ref name=\"kahane.org\"/> He encouraged retaliatory violence against Arabs who attacked Jews: \"I approve of anybody who commits such acts of violence. Really, I don't think that we can sit back and watch Arabs throwing rocks at buses whenever they feel like it. They must understand that a bomb thrown at a Jewish bus is going to mean a bomb thrown at an Arab bus.\"<ref name=\"kahane.org\"/>\n\nIn some of his writings, Kahane argued that Israel should never start a war for territory but that if a war were launched against Israel, Biblical territory should be annexed.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kahane|first1=Meir|title=Palestine?|url=http://mkwords.com/text/?i=86&a=Palestine|website=mkwords.com|date=1974|quote=If there are those who wish to create something known as 'Palestine' they are welcome to do so in 'Jordan' which in itself is a fictitious state created by the imperialist British by cutting away, in 1921, the eastern part of the Land of Israel. The Arabs who call themselves 'Palestinians' had the opportunity to create a 'Palestine' in a far larger part of the Land of Israel, but refused to do so. They lost that chance forever and if they refuse to create a state in 'Jordan' now, but insist upon war, they will lose again and lose 'Jordan' in the process because - while we will never begin a war for those parts of the [[Land of Israel]] now under foreign rule, should the Arabs begin that war, and we liberate still other areas of the Land of Israel, then those will never be given up either.}}</ref> However, in an interview, he defined Israel's \"minimal borders\" as follows: \"The southern boundary goes up to El Arish, which takes in all of northern [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]], including [[Yamit]]. To the east, the frontier runs along the western part of the East Bank of the [[River Jordan|Jordan River]], hence part of what is now Jordan. [[Land of Israel|Eretz Yisrael]] also includes part of Lebanon and certain parts of Syria, and part of Iraq, all the way to the [[Euphrates River]].\"<ref name=\"kahane.org\"/> When critics suggested that following Kahane's plans would mean a perpetual war between Jews and Arabs, Kahane responded, \"There will be a perpetual war.

Eliyahu wrote an approbation to Kahane's [[Tanakh]] commentary, \"Perush Hamacabee\", where he refers to Kahane as \"HaRav HaGaon\" (\"the rabbinic genius\"), a praiseworthy title attributed to the very saintly. Eliyahu wrote, \"Only the Torah way interested Kahane, which he constantly toiled over and which served as his strength... When one considers the depth and clarity of [Kahane's] works, one is astonished at how he had the time to compile such.

The Knesset responded in 1985 by amending the \"Basic Law:Knesset\" to include a prohibition (paragraph 7a) against registration of parties that explicitly or implicitly incite racism.\n\n=== Election to Knesset ===\nIn the [[1984 Israeli legislative election|1984 legislative elections]], Kahane's Kach party received 25,907 votes, gaining one seat in the Knesset, which was taken by Kahane. He refused to take the standard [[oath of office]] and insisted on adding a Biblical verse from [[Psalms]] to indicate that national laws were overruled by the [[Torah]] if they conflict. Kahane's legislative proposals focused on Jewish education, an open economy, transferring the Arab population out of the [[Land of Israel]], revoking Israeli citizenship from non-Jews, and banning Jewish-Gentile marriages and sexual relations. \n\nWhile his popularity in Israel grew, Kahane was boycotted in the Knesset, where his speeches were often made to an assembly that was empty except for the duty chairman and the transcriptionist. Kahane's legislative proposals and motions of no-confidence against the government were ignored or rejected. Kahane often pejoratively called other Knesset members \"[[Hellenistic|Hellenists]], a reference to Jews who assimilated into [[Greek culture]] after [[Judea]]'s occupation by [[Alexander the Great]]. In 1987, Kahane opened a [[yeshiva]] (\"HaRaayon HaYehudi\") with funding from US supporters to teach \"the Authentic Jewish Idea\". Despite the boycott, his popularity grew among the Israeli public, especially for working-class [[Sephardi Jews]].<ref name=\"cut down\">[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20113657,00.html After a Career of Preaching Hatred for Arabs, Rabbi Meir Kahane Is Cut Down by An Assassin's Bullet] People Magazine</ref> Polls showed that Kach would have likely received anywhere from four to twelve seats in the coming November 1988 elections.<ref>[http://www.washington-report.org/backissues/0799/9907081.html Jewish Defense League Unleashes Campaign of Violence in America] New York Times, October 17, 1988</ref><ref>{{Google books |id=6iHOrDQghpcC |page=196 |title=Jew vs. Jew: the struggle for the soul of American Jewry }}, Samuel G.

The Central Elections Committee banned Kahane a second time, and he appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court. However, the Supreme Court this time ruled in favor of the committee, disqualifying Kach from running in the [[1988 Israeli legislative election|1988 legislative elections]]. Kahane was thus the first candidate in Israel to be barred from election for racism. The move was criticized as being anti-democratic by [[Alan M.

As a result of this legislation, Kahane renounced his United States citizenship. Following his banning from the Knesset, he tried to get his U.S. citizenship reinstated on the basis of the fact that he was compelled to relinquish it by the Knesset. It was not reinstated, but he was permitted to continue traveling to the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/immigrationlaw/chapter12.html |title=Concepts of Citizenship  |author=Weissbrodt, David and Danielson, Laura |date=2004 |website=University of Minnesota Human Rights Library  |publisher= |access-date=July 28, 2019|quote=Kahane was a U.S. citizen at birth. He moved to Israel where he became active in politics and was elected to the Israeli Parliament. Kahane, aware of the fact that accepting an office under a foreign government was an expatriating act listed in INA 349 (a)(4), communicated on several occasions with the State Department that he did not intend to give up his U.S. citizenship. The State Department nonetheless claimed that Kahane committed the expatriating act by shifting his allegiance to Israel. The court rejected this argument because an actor who contemporaneously with the expatriating act declares his intent to stay a U.S. citizen automatically preserves his citizenship. Kahane v. Shultz (E.D.N.Y.1987). One year later, the Israeli Parliament passed a law providing that its members could only be Israeli citizens. Kahane executed a formal oath of renunciation of his U.S. citizenship to remain eligible for a seat in the Parliament. After Kahane's party was barred, on different grounds, from running in the elections, Kahane tried to revoke his renunciation of U.S. citizenship claiming that the Israeli law compelled his act. The court ruled against Kahane, who remained expatriated, although he was permitted to visit the United States and was eventually assassinated in New York City. Kahane v.

He also noted, \"[[Democracy]] and [[Judaism]] are not the same thing.\"<ref>\"One absolutely cannot confuse them. The objective of a democratic state is to allow a person to do exactly as he wishes.

He also warned of the danger of non-Jewish citizens becoming a majority and voting against the Jewish character of the state: \"The question is as follows: if the Arabs settle among us and make enough children to become a majority, will Israel continue to be a Jewish state? Do we have to accept that the Arab majority will decide?\"<ref name=\"kahane.org\">Kahane.org</ref> \"Western democracy has to be ruled out. For me, that's cut and dried: There's no question of setting up democracy in Israel, because democracy means equal rights for all, irrespective of racial or religious origins.\"\n\nKahane proposed an \"[[population transfer|exchange of populations]]\" that would continue the [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands]]: \"A total of some 750,000 Jews fled Arab lands since 1948. Surely it is time for Jews, worried over the huge growth of Arabs in Israel, to consider finishing the exchange of populations that began 35 years ago.\" Kahane proposed a $40,000 compensation plan for Arabs who would leave voluntarily, and forcible expulsion for those who \"don't want to leave\".<ref name=\"kahane.org\"/> He encouraged retaliatory violence against Arabs who attacked Jews: \"I approve of anybody who commits such acts of violence. Really, I don't think that we can sit back and watch Arabs throwing rocks at buses whenever they feel like it. They must understand that a bomb thrown at a Jewish bus is going to mean a bomb thrown at an Arab bus.\"<ref name=\"kahane.org\"/>\n\nIn some of his writings, Kahane argued that Israel should never start a war for territory but that if a war were launched against Israel, Biblical territory should be annexed.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kahane|first1=Meir|title=Palestine?|url=http://mkwords.com/text/?i=86&a=Palestine|website=mkwords.com|date=1974|quote=If there are those who wish to create something known as 'Palestine' they are welcome to do so in 'Jordan' which in itself is a fictitious state created by the imperialist British by cutting away, in 1921, the eastern part of the Land of Israel.

They lost that chance forever and if they refuse to create a state in 'Jordan' now, but insist upon war, they will lose again and lose 'Jordan' in the process because - while we will never begin a war for those parts of the [[Land of Israel]] now under foreign rule, should the Arabs begin that war, and we liberate still other areas of the Land of Israel, then those will never be given up either.}}</ref> However, in an interview, he defined Israel's \"minimal borders\" as follows: \"The southern boundary goes up to El Arish, which takes in all of northern [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]], including [[Yamit]]. To the east, the frontier runs along the western part of the East Bank of the [[River Jordan|Jordan River]], hence part of what is now Jordan.
