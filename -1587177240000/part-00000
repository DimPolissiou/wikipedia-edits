In 1785, the astronomer [[William Herschel]] noted a faint reddish hue in the core region of Andromeda. He believed Andromeda to be the nearest of all the \"great [[nebula]]e\", and based on the color and magnitude of the nebula, he incorrectly guessed that it was no more than 2,000 times the distance of [[Sirius]], or roughly {{convert|18,000|ly|kpc|abbr=on|lk=on}}.<ref name=\"Herschel 1785\" /> In 1850, [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse]]  made the first drawing of Andromeda's [[Spiral galaxy#Structure|spiral structure]].\n\nIn 1864, [[William Huggins]] noted that the [[spectrum]] of Andromeda differed from that of a gaseous nebula.<ref name=\"Huggins & Miller 1864\" /> The spectra of Andromeda displays a [[wikt:continuum|continuum]] of [[frequency|frequencies]], superimposed with dark [[spectral line|absorption lines]] that help identify the chemical composition of an object. Andromeda's spectrum is very similar to the spectra of individual stars, and from this, it was deduced that Andromeda has a stellar nature. In 1885, a [[supernova]] (known as [[SN 1885A|S Andromedae]]) was seen in Andromeda, the first and so far only one observed in that galaxy. At the time Andromeda was considered to be a nearby object, so the cause was thought to be a much less luminous and unrelated event called a [[nova]], and was named accordingly; \"Nova 1885\".<ref name=\"Backhouse 1888\" />\n\nIn 1887, [[Isaac Roberts]] took the first photographs of Andromeda, which was still commonly thought to be a nebula within our galaxy. Roberts mistook Andromeda and similar spiral nebulae as solar systems being formed.{{citation needed |date=April 2012}} In 1912, [[Vesto Slipher]] used [[spectroscopy]] to measure the radial velocity of Andromeda with respect to our [[Solar System]]\u2014the largest velocity yet measured, at {{convert|300|km/s|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Slipher 1913\" />\n\n=== Island universe ===\n[[File: Andromeda constellation map.svg|thumb|right|Location of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) in the Andromeda constellation.]]\n\nIn 1917, [[Heber Doust Curtis|Heber Curtis]] observed a [[nova]] within Andromeda. Searching the photographic record, 11 more novae were discovered. Curtis noticed that these novae were, on average, 10 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitudes]] fainter than those that occurred elsewhere in the sky. As a result, he was able to come up with a distance estimate of {{convert|500000|ly|abbr=on}}. He became a proponent of the so-called \"island universes\" hypothesis, which held that [[Spiral galaxy#Spiral nebula|spiral nebulae]] were actually independent galaxies.<ref name=\"Curtis 1988\" />\n\n[[File:\u041d\u0430\u0434 VLT \u2013 \u0434\u0432\u0435 \u0433\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438, \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0438\u043c\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044b\u043c \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0437\u043e\u043c.jpg|thumb|left| Andromeda Galaxy above the [[Very Large Telescope]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Two naked-eye galaxies above the VLT |url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1342a/ |accessdate=22 October 2013 |newspaper=ESO Picture of the Week }}</ref> The [[Triangulum Galaxy]] is visible on the top.]]\n\nIn 1920, the [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Great Debate]] between [[Harlow Shapley]] and Curtis took place concerning the nature of the [[Milky Way]], spiral nebulae, and the dimensions of the [[Universe]]. To support his claim of the Great Andromeda Nebula being, in fact, an external galaxy, Curtis also noted the appearance of dark lanes within Andromeda which resembled the dust clouds in our own galaxy, as well as historical observations of Andromeda Galaxy's significant [[Doppler shift]]. In 1922 [[Ernst \u00d6pik]] presented a method to estimate the distance of Andromeda using the measured velocities of its stars. His result placed the Andromeda Nebula far outside our galaxy at a distance of about {{convert|450|kpc|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"\u00d6pik 1922\" /> [[Edwin Hubble]] settled the debate in 1925 when he identified extragalactic [[Cepheid variable star]]s for the first time on astronomical photos of Andromeda. These were made using the {{convert|2.5|m|adj=on}} [[Hooker telescope]], and they enabled the distance of Great Andromeda Nebula to be determined. His measurement demonstrated conclusively that this feature was not a cluster of stars and gas within our own galaxy, but an entirely separate galaxy located a significant distance from the Milky Way.<ref name=\"Hubble 1929\" />\n\nIn 1943, [[Walter Baade]] was the first person to resolve stars in the central region of the Andromeda Galaxy. Baade identified two distinct populations of stars based on their [[metallicity]], naming the young, high-velocity stars in the disk Type I and the older, red stars in the bulge Type II. This nomenclature was subsequently adopted for stars within the Milky Way, and elsewhere. (The existence of two distinct populations had been noted earlier by [[Jan Oort]].)<ref name=\"Baade 1944\" /> Baade also discovered that there were two types of Cepheid variables, which resulted in a doubling of the distance estimate to Andromeda, as well as the remainder of the Universe.<ref name=\"Gribbin 2001\" />\n\nIn 1950, radio emission from the Andromeda Galaxy was detected by [[Robert Hanbury Brown|Hanbury Brown]] and [[Cyril Hazard]] at [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]].<ref name=\"Brown & Hazard 1950\" /><ref name=\"Brown & Hazard 1951\" /> The first [[radio astronomy|radio maps]] of the galaxy were made in the 1950s by [[John E.

In the 1990s, measurements of both standard [[red giant]]s as well as [[red clump]] stars from the ''[[Hipparcos]]'' satellite measurements were used to calibrate the Cepheid distances.<ref name=\"Holland 1998\" /><ref name=\"Stanek & Garnavich 1998\" />\n\n=== Formation and history ===\n[[File:WISE- Andromeda.jpg|thumb|left|The Andromeda Galaxy as seen by [[NASA]]'s [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]].]]\n\nThe Andromeda Galaxy was formed roughly 10 billion years ago from the collision and subsequent merger of smaller [[protogalaxy|protogalaxies]].<ref name=\"Davidge & McCoonnachie 2012\">{{cite journal\n| last1 = Davidge | first1 = Timothy (Tim) J.\n| last2 = McConnachie | first2 = Alan W.\n| last3 = Fardal | first3 = Mark A.\n| display-authors=3\n| last4 = Fliri | first4 = J\u00fcrgen\n| last5 = Valls-Gabaud | first5 = David\n| last6 = Chapman | first6 = Scott C.\n| last7 = Lewis | first7 = Geraint F. \n| last8 = Rich | first8 = Robert Michael\n| date = 2012\n| title = The Recent Stellar Archeology of M31 \u2013 The Nearest Red Disk Galaxy\n| journal = [[The Astrophysical Journal]]\n| volume = 751\n| issue = 1\n| bibcode = 2012ApJ...751...74D\n| doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/751/1/74\n| arxiv = 1203.6081\n| pages = 74 }}</ref>\n\nThis violent collision formed most of the galaxy's (metal-rich) [[galactic halo]] and extended disk. During this epoch, its rate of [[star formation]] would have been [[Starburst galaxy|very high]], to the point of becoming a [[luminous infrared galaxy]] for roughly 100 million years. Andromeda and the [[Triangulum Galaxy]] had a very close passage 2\u20134 billion years ago. This event produced high rates of star formation across the Andromeda Galaxy's disk\u2014even some globular clusters\u2014and disturbed M33's outer disk.\n\nOver the past 2 billion years, star formation throughout Andromeda's disk is thought to have decreased to the point of near-inactivity. There have been interactions with satellite galaxies like M32, M110, or others that have already been absorbed by Andromeda Galaxy. These interactions have formed structures like [[List of stellar streams#Andromeda Galaxy streams|Andromeda's Giant Stellar Stream]]. A galactic merger roughly 100 million years ago is believed to be responsible for a counter-rotating disk of gas found in the center of Andromeda as well as the presence there of a relatively young (100 million years old) stellar population.<ref name=\"Davidge & McCoonnachie 2012\"/>\n\n=== Distance estimate ===\nAt least four distinct techniques have been used to estimate distances from Earth to the Andromeda Galaxy. In 2003, using the infrared [[surface brightness fluctuation]]s (I-SBF) and adjusting for the new period-luminosity value and a metallicity correction of \u22120.2 mag dex<sup>\u22121</sup> in (O/H), an estimate of {{convert|2.57|+/-|0.06|e6ly|lk=on|abbr=off}} was derived. A 2004 [[Cepheid variable]] method estimated the distance to be 2.51 \u00b1 0.13 million light-years (770 \u00b1 40 kpc).<ref name=\"Karachentsevetal2006\" /><ref name=\"karachentsevetal2004\" /> In 2005, an eclipsing [[binary star]] was discovered in the Andromeda Galaxy. The binary{{efn|name=M31VJ}} is two hot blue stars of [[stellar classification|types]] O and B. By studying the eclipses of the stars, astronomers were able to measure their sizes. Knowing the sizes and temperatures of the stars, they were able to measure their [[absolute magnitude]]. When the [[apparent magnitude|visual]] and absolute magnitudes are known, the distance to the star can be calculated.

The ultraviolet view shows that these arms more closely resemble the ring-like structure previously observed in infrared wavelengths with NASA's [[Spitzer Space Telescope]].

This constitutes evidence that there is a vast, extended stellar disk that makes the galaxy more than {{convert|220000|ly|kpc|lk=on|abbr=off}} in diameter.

Analysis of the cross-sectional shape of the galaxy appears to demonstrate a pronounced, S-shaped warp, rather than just a flat disk.<ref name=\"UC Santa Cruz 2001\" /> A possible cause of such a warp could be gravitational interaction with the satellite galaxies near the Andromeda Galaxy. The Galaxy [[Triangulum Galaxy|M33]] could be responsible for some warp in Andromeda's arms, though more precise distances and radial velocities are required.\n\nSpectroscopic studies have provided detailed measurements of the [[Galaxy rotation curve|rotational velocity of the Andromeda Galaxy]] as a function of radial distance from the core. The rotational velocity has a maximum value of {{convert|225|km/s|abbr=on}} at {{convert|1300|ly|lk=on|abbr=on}} from the core, and it has its minimum possibly as low as {{convert|50|km/s|abbr=on}} at {{convert|7000|ly|abbr=on}} from the core. Further out, rotational velocity rises out to a radius of {{convert|33000|ly|abbr=on}}, where it reaches a peak of {{convert|250|km/s|abbr=on}}. The velocities slowly decline beyond that distance, dropping to around {{convert|200|km/s|abbr=on}} at {{convert|80000|ly|abbr=on}}.

The brighter concentration, designated as P1, is offset from the center of the galaxy.

P2 also contains a compact disk of hot, [[stellar classification|spectral-class]] A stars.

In 1785, the astronomer [[William Herschel]] noted a faint reddish hue in the core region of Andromeda. He believed Andromeda to be the nearest of all the \"great [[nebula]]e\", and based on the color and magnitude of the nebula, he incorrectly guessed that it was no more than 2,000 times the distance of [[Sirius]], or roughly {{convert|18,000|ly|kpc|abbr=on|lk=on}}.<ref name=\"Herschel 1785\" /> In 1850, [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse]]  made the first drawing of Andromeda's [[Spiral galaxy#Structure|spiral structure]].\n\nIn 1864, [[William Huggins]] noted that the [[spectrum]] of Andromeda differed from that of a gaseous nebula.<ref name=\"Huggins & Miller 1864\" /> The spectra of Andromeda displays a [[wikt:continuum|continuum]] of [[frequency|frequencies]], superimposed with dark [[spectral line|absorption lines]] that help identify the chemical composition of an object. Andromeda's spectrum is very similar to the spectra of individual stars, and from this, it was deduced that Andromeda has a stellar nature. In 1885, a [[supernova]] (known as [[SN 1885A|S Andromedae]]) was seen in Andromeda, the first and so far only one observed in that galaxy. At the time Andromeda was considered to be a nearby object, so the cause was thought to be a much less luminous and unrelated event called a [[nova]], and was named accordingly; \"Nova 1885\".<ref name=\"Backhouse 1888\" />\n\nIn 1887, [[Isaac Roberts]] took the first photographs of Andromeda, which was still commonly thought to be a nebula within our galaxy. Roberts mistook Andromeda and similar spiral nebulae as solar systems being formed.{{citation needed |date=April 2012}} In 1912, [[Vesto Slipher]] used [[spectroscopy]] to measure the radial velocity of Andromeda with respect to our [[Solar System]]\u2014the largest velocity yet measured, at {{convert|300|km/s|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Slipher 1913\" />\n\n=== Island universe ===\n[[File: Andromeda constellation map.svg|thumb|right|Location of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) in the Andromeda constellation.]]\n\nIn 1917, [[Heber Doust Curtis|Heber Curtis]] observed a [[nova]] within Andromeda. Searching the photographic record, 11 more novae were discovered. Curtis noticed that these novae were, on average, 10 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitudes]] fainter than those that occurred elsewhere in the sky. As a result, he was able to come up with a distance estimate of {{convert|500000|ly|abbr=on}}. He became a proponent of the so-called \"island universes\" hypothesis, which held that [[Spiral galaxy#Spiral nebula|spiral nebulae]] were actually independent galaxies.<ref name=\"Curtis 1988\" />\n\n[[File:\u041d\u0430\u0434 VLT \u2013 \u0434\u0432\u0435 \u0433\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438, \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0438\u043c\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044b\u043c \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0437\u043e\u043c.jpg|thumb|left| Andromeda Galaxy above the [[Very Large Telescope]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Two naked-eye galaxies above the VLT |url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1342a/ |accessdate=22 October 2013 |newspaper=ESO Picture of the Week }}</ref> The [[Triangulum Galaxy]] is visible on the top.]]\n\nIn 1920, the [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Great Debate]] between [[Harlow Shapley]] and Curtis took place concerning the nature of the [[Milky Way]], spiral nebulae, and the dimensions of the [[Universe]]. To support his claim of the Great Andromeda Nebula being, in fact, an external galaxy, Curtis also noted the appearance of dark lanes within Andromeda which resembled the dust clouds in our own galaxy, as well as historical observations of Andromeda Galaxy's significant [[Doppler shift]]. In 1922 [[Ernst \u00d6pik]] presented a method to estimate the distance of Andromeda using the measured velocities of its stars. His result placed the Andromeda Nebula far outside our galaxy at a distance of about {{convert|450|kpc|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"\u00d6pik 1922\" /> [[Edwin Hubble]] settled the debate in 1925 when he identified extragalactic [[Cepheid variable star]]s for the first time on astronomical photos of Andromeda. These were made using the {{convert|2.5|m|adj=on}} [[Hooker telescope]], and they enabled the distance of Great Andromeda Nebula to be determined. His measurement demonstrated conclusively that this feature was not a cluster of stars and gas within our own galaxy, but an entirely separate galaxy located a significant distance from the Milky Way.<ref name=\"Hubble 1929\" />\n\nIn 1943, [[Walter Baade]] was the first person to resolve stars in the central region of the Andromeda Galaxy. Baade identified two distinct populations of stars based on their [[metallicity]], naming the young, high-velocity stars in the disk Type I and the older, red stars in the bulge Type II. This nomenclature was subsequently adopted for stars within the Milky Way, and elsewhere. (The existence of two distinct populations had been noted earlier by [[Jan Oort]].)<ref name=\"Baade 1944\" /> Baade also discovered that there were two types of Cepheid variables, which resulted in a doubling of the distance estimate to Andromeda, as well as the remainder of the Universe.<ref name=\"Gribbin 2001\" />\n\nIn 1950, radio emission from the Andromeda Galaxy was detected by [[Robert Hanbury Brown|Hanbury Brown]] and [[Cyril Hazard]] at [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]].<ref name=\"Brown & Hazard 1950\" /><ref name=\"Brown & Hazard 1951\" /> The first [[radio astronomy|radio maps]] of the galaxy were made in the 1950s by [[John E.

In 2009, the first planet may have been discovered in the Andromeda Galaxy. This was detected using a technique called [[microlensing]], which is caused by the deflection of light by a massive object.<ref name=\"Ingrosso 2009\" />\n\n== General ==\nThe estimated distance of the Andromeda Galaxy from our own was doubled in 1953 when it was discovered that there is another, dimmer type of [[Cepheid]]. In the 1990s, measurements of both standard [[red giant]]s as well as [[red clump]] stars from the ''[[Hipparcos]]'' satellite measurements were used to calibrate the Cepheid distances.<ref name=\"Holland 1998\" /><ref name=\"Stanek & Garnavich 1998\" />\n\n=== Formation and history ===\n[[File:WISE- Andromeda.jpg|thumb|left|The Andromeda Galaxy as seen by [[NASA]]'s [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]].]]\n\nThe Andromeda Galaxy was formed roughly 10 billion years ago from the collision and subsequent merger of smaller [[protogalaxy|protogalaxies]].<ref name=\"Davidge & McCoonnachie 2012\">{{cite journal\n| last1 = Davidge | first1 = Timothy (Tim) J.\n| last2 = McConnachie | first2 = Alan W.\n| last3 = Fardal | first3 = Mark A.\n| display-authors=3\n| last4 = Fliri | first4 = J\u00fcrgen\n| last5 = Valls-Gabaud | first5 = David\n| last6 = Chapman | first6 = Scott C.\n| last7 = Lewis | first7 = Geraint F. \n| last8 = Rich | first8 = Robert Michael\n| date = 2012\n| title = The Recent Stellar Archeology of M31 \u2013 The Nearest Red Disk Galaxy\n| journal = [[The Astrophysical Journal]]\n| volume = 751\n| issue = 1\n| bibcode = 2012ApJ...751...74D\n| doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/751/1/74\n| arxiv = 1203.6081\n| pages = 74 }}</ref>\n\nThis violent collision formed most of the galaxy's (metal-rich) [[galactic halo]] and extended disk. During this epoch, its rate of [[star formation]] would have been [[Starburst galaxy|very high]], to the point of becoming a [[luminous infrared galaxy]] for roughly 100 million years. Andromeda and the [[Triangulum Galaxy]] had a very close passage 2\u20134 billion years ago. This event produced high rates of star formation across the Andromeda Galaxy's disk\u2014even some globular clusters\u2014and disturbed M33's outer disk.\n\nOver the past 2 billion years, star formation throughout Andromeda's disk is thought to have decreased to the point of near-inactivity. There have been interactions with satellite galaxies like M32, M110, or others that have already been absorbed by Andromeda Galaxy. These interactions have formed structures like [[List of stellar streams#Andromeda Galaxy streams|Andromeda's Giant Stellar Stream]]. A galactic merger roughly 100 million years ago is believed to be responsible for a counter-rotating disk of gas found in the center of Andromeda as well as the presence there of a relatively young (100 million years old) stellar population.<ref name=\"Davidge & McCoonnachie 2012\"/>\n\n=== Distance estimate ===\nAt least four distinct techniques have been used to estimate distances from Earth to the Andromeda Galaxy. In 2003, using the infrared [[surface brightness fluctuation]]s (I-SBF) and adjusting for the new period-luminosity value and a metallicity correction of \u22120.2 mag dex<sup>\u22121</sup> in (O/H), an estimate of {{convert|2.57|+/-|0.06|e6ly|lk=on|abbr=off}} was derived. A 2004 [[Cepheid variable]] method estimated the distance to be 2.51 \u00b1 0.13 million light-years (770 \u00b1 40 kpc).<ref name=\"Karachentsevetal2006\" /><ref name=\"karachentsevetal2004\" /> In 2005, an eclipsing [[binary star]] was discovered in the Andromeda Galaxy. The binary{{efn|name=M31VJ}} is two hot blue stars of [[stellar classification|types]] O and B. By studying the eclipses of the stars, astronomers were able to measure their sizes. Knowing the sizes and temperatures of the stars, they were able to measure their [[absolute magnitude]].

The halo is enriched in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, formed from [[supernova]]e and its properties are those expected for a galaxy that lies in the \"green valley\" of the [[Galaxy color\u2013magnitude diagram]] (see [[Andromeda Galaxy#Luminosity|below]]). Supernovae erupt in Andromeda Galaxy's star-filled disk and eject these heavier elements into space.

Star formation activity in green valley galaxies is slowing as they run out of star-forming gas in the interstellar medium. In simulated galaxies with similar properties to Andromeda Galaxy, star formation is expected to extinguish within about five billion years from the now, even accounting for the expected, short-term increase in the rate of star formation due to the collision between Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way.<ref>{{cite journal \n|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/736/2/84 \n|title=The Mid-life Crisis of the Milky Way and M31 \n|date=2011 \n|last=Mutch |first=Simon J. \n|last2=Croton | first2=Darren J. \n|last3=Poole | first3=Gregory B.\n|journal=The Astrophysical Journal \n|volume=736 \n|issue=2 \n|bibcode = 2011ApJ...736...84M \n|arxiv = 1105.2564 \n|pages=84 }}</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\n[[File:Infraredandromeda.jpg|thumb|The Andromeda Galaxy seen in [[infrared]] by the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]], one of [[NASA]]'s four [[Great Observatories program|Great Space Observatories]].]]\n[[File:Andromeda galaxy Ssc2005-20a1.jpg|thumb|Image of the Andromeda Galaxy taken by Spitzer in infrared, 24 [[micrometre]]s (Credit:[[NASA]]/[[JPL]]\u2013[[Caltech]]/Karl D.

Dark blue-grey lanes of cooler dust show up starkly against these bright rings, tracing the regions where star formation is currently taking place in dense cloudy cocoons. When observed in visible light, Andromeda Galaxy's rings look more like spiral arms. The ultraviolet view shows that these arms more closely resemble the ring-like structure previously observed in infrared wavelengths with NASA's [[Spitzer Space Telescope]]. Astronomers using the latter interpreted these rings as evidence that the galaxy was involved in a direct collision with its neighbor, M32, more than 200 million years ago.]]\n\nBased on its appearance in visible light, the Andromeda Galaxy is classified as an SA(s)b galaxy in the [[Galaxy morphological classification#De Vaucouleurs system|de Vaucouleurs\u2013Sandage extended classification system]] of spiral galaxies.<ref name=\"ned\" /> However, infrared data from the [[2MASS]] survey and from the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] showed that Andromeda is actually a [[barred spiral galaxy]], like the Milky Way, with Andromeda's bar major axis oriented 55 degrees anti-clockwise from the disc major axis.<ref name=\"Beaton 2006\" />\n\nIn 2005, astronomers used the [[Keck telescopes]] to show that the tenuous sprinkle of stars extending outward from the galaxy is actually part of the main disk itself.<ref name=\"Chapman et al 2006\" /> This means that the spiral disk of stars in the Andromeda Galaxy is three times larger in diameter than previously estimated. This constitutes evidence that there is a vast, extended stellar disk that makes the galaxy more than {{convert|220000|ly|kpc|lk=on|abbr=off}} in diameter. Previously, estimates of the Andromeda Galaxy's size ranged from {{convert|70000|to|120000|ly|kpc}} across.\n\nThe galaxy is inclined an estimated 77\u00b0 relative to Earth (where an angle of 90\u00b0 would be viewed directly from the side). Analysis of the cross-sectional shape of the galaxy appears to demonstrate a pronounced, S-shaped warp, rather than just a flat disk.<ref name=\"UC Santa Cruz 2001\" /> A possible cause of such a warp could be gravitational interaction with the satellite galaxies near the Andromeda Galaxy. The Galaxy [[Triangulum Galaxy|M33]] could be responsible for some warp in Andromeda's arms, though more precise distances and radial velocities are required.\n\nSpectroscopic studies have provided detailed measurements of the [[Galaxy rotation curve|rotational velocity of the Andromeda Galaxy]] as a function of radial distance from the core. The rotational velocity has a maximum value of {{convert|225|km/s|abbr=on}} at {{convert|1300|ly|lk=on|abbr=on}} from the core, and it has its minimum possibly as low as {{convert|50|km/s|abbr=on}} at {{convert|7000|ly|abbr=on}} from the core. Further out, rotational velocity rises out to a radius of {{convert|33000|ly|abbr=on}}, where it reaches a peak of {{convert|250|km/s|abbr=on}}. The velocities slowly decline beyond that distance, dropping to around {{convert|200|km/s|abbr=on}} at {{convert|80000|ly|abbr=on}}. These velocity measurements imply a concentrated mass of about {{Solar mass|6{{e|9}}|link=y}} in the [[Galaxy nucleus|nucleus]]. The total mass of the galaxy increases [[linearity|linearly]] out to {{convert|45000|ly|abbr=on}}, then more slowly beyond that radius.<ref name=\"Rubin & Ford 1970\" />\n\nThe [[Spiral galaxy#Spiral arms|spiral arms]] of the Andromeda Galaxy are outlined by a series of [[H II region|HII regions]], first studied in great detail by [[Walter Baade]] and described by him as resembling \"beads on a string\".

[[NASA]]/[[European Space Agency|ESA]]&nbsp;photo.]]\n\nM31 is known to harbor a dense and compact star cluster at its very center. In a large telescope it creates a visual impression of a star embedded in the more diffuse surrounding bulge. In 1991, the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] was used to image Andromeda Galaxy's inner nucleus. The nucleus consists of two concentrations separated by {{convert|1.5|pc|lk=on|abbr=on}}. The brighter concentration, designated as P1, is offset from the center of the galaxy. The dimmer concentration, P2, falls at the true center of the galaxy and contains a [[black hole]] measured at 3\u20135 \u00d7 10<sup>7</sup> {{Solar mass}} in 1993,<ref name=\"Lauer\" /> and at 1.1\u20132.3 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup> {{Solar mass}} in 2005.<ref name=\"Bender et al 2005\" /> The [[velocity dispersion]] of material around it is measured to be \u2248 {{convert|160|km/s|abbr=on|lk=on}}.<ref name=\"Gebhardt et al 2000\" />\n\n[[File:M31 Core in X-rays.jpg|thumb|[[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra X-ray telescope]] image of the center of Andromeda Galaxy.

The blue source at the center is at the position of the [[supermassive black hole]].]]\n\nIt has been proposed that the observed double nucleus could be explained if P1 is the projection of a disk of stars in an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentric orbit]] around the central black hole.<ref name=\"Tremaine 1995\" /> The eccentricity is such that stars linger at the orbital [[apsis|apocenter]], creating a concentration of stars. P2 also contains a compact disk of hot, [[stellar classification|spectral-class]] A stars. The A stars are not evident in redder filters, but in blue and ultraviolet light they dominate the nucleus, causing P2 to appear more prominent than P1.<ref name=\"hubblesite 1993-07-20\" />\n\nWhile at the initial time of its discovery it was hypothesized that the brighter portion of the double nucleus is the remnant of a small galaxy \"cannibalized\" by Andromeda Galaxy,<ref name=\"Schewe & Stein 1993\" /> this is no longer considered a viable explanation, largely because such a nucleus would have an exceedingly short lifetime due to [[tidal force|tidal disruption]] by the central black hole. While this could be partially resolved if P1 had its own black hole to stabilize it, the distribution of stars in P1 does not suggest that there is a black hole at its center.<ref name=\"Tremaine 1995\" />\n\n== Discrete sources ==\n[[File:PIA20061 - Andromeda in High-Energy X-rays, Figure 1.jpg|thumb|center|400px|The Andromeda Galaxy in high-energy X-ray and ultraviolet light (released 5 January 2016).]]\n[[File: Andromeda active core.jpg|thumb|Artist's concept of the Andromeda Galaxy's core, showing a view across a disk of young, blue stars encircling a supermassive black hole.

The emission above 25 keV was later found to be originating from a single source named [[3XMM J004232.1+411314]], and identified as a binary system where a compact object (a [[neutron star]] or a [[black hole]]) accretes matter from a star.<ref name=\"Marelli et al. 2017\" />\n\nMultiple X-ray sources have since been detected in the Andromeda Galaxy, using observations from the [[European Space Agency]]'s (ESA) [[XMM-Newton]] orbiting observatory. [[Robin Barnard]] ''et al.'' hypothesized that these are candidate black holes or [[neutron star]]s, which are heating the incoming gas to millions of kelvins and emitting X-rays. Neutron stars and black holes can be distinguished mainly by measuring their masses.<ref name=\"Barnard Kolb & Osborne 2005\" /> An observation campaign of [[NuSTAR]] space mission identified 40 objects of this kind in the galaxy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Andromeda Galaxy Scanned with High-Energy X-ray Vision|url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4811|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref>\nIn 2012, a [[microquasar]], a radio burst emanating from a smaller black hole was detected in the Andromeda Galaxy.

As a senior, he helped lead the Bears to the NIT Championship.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/spurs/news/elson_060802.html ''Spurs sign Francisco Elson'', spurs.com], August 2, 2006</ref>  Elson was drafted in the second round of the [[1999 NBA Draft]] from [[University of California, Berkeley|Cal]] by the [[Denver Nuggets]], but did not commence play with them until the [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304 campaign]].

He is the diminutive, blond-haired [[caveman]] husband of [[Betty Rubble]] and adoptive father of [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble]]. His best friend is his next door neighbor, [[Fred Flintstone|Fred]].\n\nBarney's personality was based on that of [[Ed Norton (Honeymooners)|Ed Norton]] on the 1950s television series ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', played by [[Art Carney]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QWQYAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA387&q=barney%20rubble%20ed%20norton|title=The Greatest Sitcoms of All Time|first=Martin|last=Gitlin|date=7 November 2013|publisher=Scarecrow Press|accessdate=20 December 2016|via=Google Books}}</ref> Like Ralph Kramden on ''The Honeymooners'', Fred was constantly on the lookout for [[get-rich-quick scheme]]s, while Barney, like Norton, found life satisfactory as it was, but participated in said schemes because Fred was his friend. Usually, after Fred had hatched one of his plans, Barney showed his agreement by laughing and saying, \"uh hee hee hee... OK, Fred!\" or \"hee hee hee... whatever you say, Fred!\"\n\nIn early episodes, Barney had a [[New Jersey English|New Jersey]] accent but was soon changed to a deeper, more chuckle-like voice. In \"On the Rocks\" and the late 2000s his Jersey accent returns.\n\nBarney's interests included bowling, playing [[billiards|pool]], [[poker]], tinkering around in Fred's garage, and playing [[golf]] (though in some episodes, Barney did not know how to play golf).  He, like Fred, was also a member of the Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes lodge and its predecessor in earlier episodes, the Loyal Order of Dinosaurs. He is also a talented pianist and drummer.<ref>\"Hot Lips Hannigan,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 1</ref> In the first episode of the original series, he was an inventor of a human-powered helicopter. Although clearly depicted as being in better shape than Fred, he is not shown to be quite as enthusiastic a sportsman as Fred is. This distinction can be attributed to Fred's fondness for food, though Barney is shown to be almost as capable of excessive appetite on a number of occasions.\n\n==Biography==\nBarney grew up at 142 Boulder Avenue in Granitetown [north of Bedrock]. He was acknowledged to be the maternal nephew of Fred's Flintone\u2019s boss, Mr. Slate by Mr Slate himself.<ref>\"Fred's New Boss,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 3</ref> As young adults, Barney and Fred worked as bellhops at a resort, where they first met Wilma and Betty, who were working as cigarette girls.<ref>\"Bachelor Daze,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 4</ref> Eventually, Barney married Betty (as Fred did Wilma).\n\nSeveral episodes and spinoffs suggest that Barney, along with Fred, spent some time in the army early in their marriages, though said references may be to Barney and Fred's military service in the first-season episode \"The Astr'nuts.\"\n\nWhile the subject of Barney's occupation (or even if he had one) was never given during the original series, the majority of subsequent spinoffs suggest at some point after the original series, Barney went to work at the Slate Rock and Gravel Company quarry alongside Fred as a fellow dino-crane operator. An early episode of the original series does have a brief scene of Barney working at the Granite Building.<ref>\"The Babysitters,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 1</ref> When speaking to an upper-crust snob in another episode, Betty declares Barney is in \"top-secret\" work, but that might have been a cover for a low-level job or unemployment, or perhaps an in-joke meaning that Barney's job was unknown even to the show's writers. It could also be possible that both Fred and Barney work at the quarry, but may work in different sections of it, under different bosses. In one episode, Barney's boss tells him to \"put down his broom\", which implies some sort of janitorial work is involved.\n\nAlso, in season one, the first fifteen episodes or so, Barney's voice, done by [[Mel Blanc]] sounded similar to [[Elmer Fudd]]. Later that season, Barney's smart-alecky personality was slowly toned down and Barney's voice at times was like Elmer Fudd and other times in the same episode was Mel Blanc's real voice. At the end of the first season, Mel Blanc nearly died in a car crash so for the first episodes made in the 61-62 season (season 2), Barney sounds more like Yogi Bear as he is voiced by [[Daws Butler]]. When Mel Blanc resumed the role, Barney's voice was deeper as Mel used his actual voice from there on in.\n\nDuring the fourth season of the original series, Betty and Barney found an abandoned infant on their doorstep, by the name of \"Bam-Bam\". A court battle ensued between the couple and a wealthy man who also had wanted to adopt Bam-Bam. Barney and Betty were successful in their efforts to adopt Bam-Bam because the wealthy man gave up (after winning the case) upon learning his wife became pregnant, after which he became a staple character on the series.<ref>\"Little Bam-Bam,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 4</ref>  For the next nine episodes (though Bam-Bam aired on \"Kleptomaniac Pebbles\" in the opening scene teaser but not in the body of the episode but would return two episodes later) after Bam-Bam's debut, no sign of him is seen on the show. This was because, while \"Little Bam Bam\" was made after these episodes, it aired before. Once more episodes were made Bam-Bam aired regularly. In the fifth season, the family buys a pet hopparoo (a combination of a kangaroo and dinosaur) named [[Hoppy (The Flintstones)|Hoppy]].\n\nWhen Bam-Bam grows into a teenager, Barney joined the Bedrock police force with Fred for a period of time as part-time officers. Both characters were paired with the [[Shmoo]] from ''[[Li'l Abner]]''.<ref name=\"comedyshow\" /> He later became grandfather to Pebbles's and Bam-Bam's children, Chip and Roxy.<ref name=\"hollyrock\" />\n\nAlthough Fred and Barney are best friends, Barney loses his patience with Fred occasionally. The best example comes in \"[[I Yabba-Dabba Do!]]\": after losing his patience with Fred for ruining Pebbles's and Bam-Bam's wedding, Barney decides to leave Bedrock. He changes his mind after Fred apologizes. Fred is often annoyed by Barney's inveterate cheerfulness, but he does truly care for him.\n\nIn the series' original episodes until the end of season 5, Barney's eyes are drawn as ovals or (occasionally) dark circular outlines (similar to [[Little Orphan Annie]] in her comics). In other episodes, and on all the season 6 ones, they are solid black, similar to Wilma's eyes. On three occasions we see the whites of his eyes: in \"The Engagement Ring\", \"Ventriloquist Barney\", and \"A Haunted House Is Not a Home\".

He is the diminutive, blond-haired [[caveman]] husband of [[Betty Rubble]] and adoptive father of [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble]]. His best friend is his next door neighbor, [[Fred Flintstone|Fred]].\n\nBarney's personality was based on that of [[Ed Norton (Honeymooners)|Ed Norton]] on the 1950s television series ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', played by [[Art Carney]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QWQYAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA387&q=barney%20rubble%20ed%20norton|title=The Greatest Sitcoms of All Time|first=Martin|last=Gitlin|date=7 November 2013|publisher=Scarecrow Press|accessdate=20 December 2016|via=Google Books}}</ref> Like Ralph Kramden on ''The Honeymooners'', Fred was constantly on the lookout for [[get-rich-quick scheme]]s, while Barney, like Norton, found life satisfactory as it was, but participated in said schemes because Fred was his friend. Usually, after Fred had hatched one of his plans, Barney showed his agreement by laughing and saying, \"uh hee hee hee... OK, Fred!\" or \"hee hee hee... whatever you say, Fred!\"\n\nIn early episodes, Barney had a [[New Jersey English|New Jersey]] accent but was soon changed to a deeper, more chuckle-like voice. In \"On the Rocks\" and the late 2000s his Jersey accent returns.\n\nBarney's interests included bowling, playing [[billiards|pool]], [[poker]], tinkering around in Fred's garage, and playing [[golf]] (though in some episodes, Barney did not know how to play golf).  He, like Fred, was also a member of the Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes lodge and its predecessor in earlier episodes, the Loyal Order of Dinosaurs. He is also a talented pianist and drummer.<ref>\"Hot Lips Hannigan,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 1</ref> In the first episode of the original series, he was an inventor of a human-powered helicopter. Although clearly depicted as being in better shape than Fred, he is not shown to be quite as enthusiastic a sportsman as Fred is. This distinction can be attributed to Fred's fondness for food, though Barney is shown to be almost as capable of excessive appetite on a number of occasions.\n\n==Biography==\nBarney grew up at 142 Boulder Avenue in Granitetown [north of Bedrock]. He was acknowledged to be the maternal nephew of Fred's Flintone\u2019s boss, Mr. Slate by Mr Slate himself.<ref>\"Fred's New Boss,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 3</ref> As young adults, Barney and Fred worked as bellhops at a resort, where they first met Wilma and Betty, who were working as cigarette girls.<ref>\"Bachelor Daze,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 4</ref> Eventually, Barney married Betty (as Fred did Wilma).\n\nSeveral episodes and spinoffs suggest that Barney, along with Fred, spent some time in the army early in their marriages, though said references may be to Barney and Fred's military service in the first-season episode \"The Astr'nuts.\"\n\nWhile the subject of Barney's occupation (or even if he had one) was never given during the original series, the majority of subsequent spinoffs suggest at some point after the original series, Barney went to work at the Slate Rock and Gravel Company quarry alongside Fred as a fellow dino-crane operator. An early episode of the original series does have a brief scene of Barney working at the Granite Building.<ref>\"The Babysitters,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 1</ref> When speaking to an upper-crust snob in another episode, Betty declares Barney is in \"top-secret\" work, but that might have been a cover for a low-level job or unemployment, or perhaps an in-joke meaning that Barney's job was unknown even to the show's writers. It could also be possible that both Fred and Barney work at the quarry, but may work in different sections of it, under different bosses. In one episode, Barney's boss tells him to \"put down his broom\", which implies some sort of janitorial work is involved.\n\nAlso, in season one, the first fifteen episodes or so, Barney's voice, done by [[Mel Blanc]] sounded similar to [[Elmer Fudd]]. Later that season, Barney's smart-alecky personality was slowly toned down and Barney's voice at times was like Elmer Fudd and other times in the same episode was Mel Blanc's real voice. At the end of the first season, Mel Blanc nearly died in a car crash so for the first episodes made in the 61-62 season (season 2), Barney sounds more like Yogi Bear as he is voiced by [[Daws Butler]]. When Mel Blanc resumed the role, Barney's voice was deeper as Mel used his actual voice from there on in.\n\nDuring the fourth season of the original series, Betty and Barney found an abandoned infant on their doorstep, by the name of \"Bam-Bam\". A court battle ensued between the couple and a wealthy man who also had wanted to adopt Bam-Bam. Barney and Betty were successful in their efforts to adopt Bam-Bam because the wealthy man gave up (after winning the case) upon learning his wife became pregnant, after which he became a staple character on the series.<ref>\"Little Bam-Bam,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 4</ref>  For the next nine episodes (though Bam-Bam aired on \"Kleptomaniac Pebbles\" in the opening scene teaser but not in the body of the episode but would return two episodes later) after Bam-Bam's debut, no sign of him is seen on the show. This was because, while \"Little Bam Bam\" was made after these episodes, it aired before. Once more episodes were made Bam-Bam aired regularly. In the fifth season, the family buys a pet hopparoo (a combination of a kangaroo and dinosaur) named [[Hoppy (The Flintstones)|Hoppy]].\n\nWhen Bam-Bam grows into a teenager, Barney joined the Bedrock police force with Fred for a period of time as part-time officers. Both characters were paired with the [[Shmoo]] from ''[[Li'l Abner]]''.<ref name=\"comedyshow\" /> He later became grandfather to Pebbles's and Bam-Bam's children, Chip and Roxy.<ref name=\"hollyrock\" />\n\nAlthough Fred and Barney are best friends, Barney loses his patience with Fred occasionally. The best example comes in \"[[I Yabba-Dabba Do!]]\": after losing his patience with Fred for ruining Pebbles's and Bam-Bam's wedding, Barney decides to leave Bedrock. He changes his mind after Fred apologizes. Fred is often annoyed by Barney's inveterate cheerfulness, but he does truly care for him.\n\nIn the series' original episodes until the end of season 5, Barney's eyes are drawn as ovals or (occasionally) dark circular outlines (similar to [[Little Orphan Annie]] in her comics). In other episodes, and on all the season 6 ones, they are solid black, similar to Wilma's eyes. On three occasions we see the whites of his eyes: in \"The Engagement Ring\", \"Ventriloquist Barney\", and \"A Haunted House Is Not a Home\". In \"The Engagement Ring\", we see Barney's whites when Fred suggests that he spar with a fearsome boxer to earn enough money to buy Betty a belated engagement ring. In \"Ventriloquist Barney\", he describes the terrifying facial features of wrestler Bronto Crushrock. In \"A Haunted House Is Not a Home\", Barney frightens Fred by gargling in the bathroom too loudly, provoking Fred to hit Barney on the head.\n\n==Animated media==\n===Television shows===\n* ''[[The Flintstones|The Flagstones]]'' (1959)\n* ''[[The Flintstones]]'' (1960\u20131966)\n* ''[[The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show]]'' (1971\u20131972)\n* ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour]]'' (1972\u20131974)\n* ''[[Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics]]'' (1977\u20131978)\n* ''[[Fred Flintstone and Friends]]'' (1977\u20131978)\n* ''[[The New Fred and Barney Show]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Thing]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'' (1979\u20131980)\n* ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show]]'' (1980\u20131982)\n* ''[[The Flintstone Funnies]]'' (1982\u20131984)\n* ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'' (1986\u20131988)\n\n===Films and specials===\n* ''[[Alice in Wonderland or What's a Nice Kid Like You Doing in a Place Like This?]]'' (1966)\n* ''[[The Man Called Flintstone]]'' (1966)\n* ''[[The Flintstones on Ice]]'' (1973)\n* ''[[A Flintstone Christmas]]'' (1977)\n* ''[[Hanna-Barbera's All-Star Comedy Ice Revue]]'' (1978)\n* ''[[The Flintstones: Little Big League]]'' (1978)\n* ''[[Hanna-Barbera Educational Filmstrips]]'' \u2013 featuring ''Bamm-Bamm Tackles a Term Paper'', ''A Weighty Problem'', ''Fire Alarm'', ''Fire Escape'' and ''Driving Guide'' (1978\u20131980)\n* ''[[The Flintstones' New Neighbors]]'' (1980)\n* ''[[The Flintstones Meet Rockula and Frankenstone]]'' (1980)\n* ''[[The Flintstones: Fred's Final Fling]]'' (1980)\n* ''[[The Flintstones: Wind-Up Wilma]]'' (1981)\n* ''[[The Flintstones: Jogging Fever]]'' (1981)\n* ''[[Yogi Bear's All Star Comedy Christmas Caper]]'' (1982)\n* ''[[The Flintstones' 25th Anniversary Celebration]]'' (1986)\n* ''[[The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones]]'' (1987)\n* ''[[The Flintstone Kids' \"Just Say No\" Special]]'' (1988)\n* ''[[Hanna-Barbera's 50th: A Yabba Dabba Doo Celebration|A Yabba Dabba Doo Celebration: 50 Years of Hanna-Barbera]]'' (1989)\n* ''[[I Yabba-Dabba Do!]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[Hollyrock-a-Bye Baby]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[A Flintstone Family Christmas]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[The Flintstones (film)|The Flintstones]]'' (1994) (portrayed by [[Rick Moranis]])\n* ''[[A Flintstones Christmas Carol]]'' (1994) (playing as [[Bob Cratchit|Bob Cragit]])\n* ''[[The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas]]'' (2000) (portrayed by [[Stephen Baldwin]])\n* ''[[The Flintstones: On the Rocks]]'' (2001) (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]])\n* ''[[The Flintstones & WWE: Stone Age SmackDown!]]'' (2015)\n\n==Portrayal==\n[[Mel Blanc]] was the principal voice of Barney Rubble, although [[Daws Butler]] (who previously voiced Ned Morton, a mouse version of Ed Norton \u2014 the inspiration for Barney Rubble \u2014 in the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' short ''The Honey-Mousers'') briefly assumed the role while Blanc recovered from a car wreck.<ref>[http://www.povonline.com/cols/COL133.htm Mel Blanc<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205054010/http://www.povonline.com/cols/COL133.htm |date=December 5, 2006 }}</ref> Since Blanc's death, [[Frank Welker]], [[Jeff Bergman]], [[Stephen Stanton]], [[Kevin Michael Richardson]], Brad Abrell, and [[Scott Innes]] have all performed the role.
