Electrical plugs and sockets differ from one another in voltage and current rating, shape, size, and connector type. Different standard systems of plugs and sockets are used around the world.\n\nPlugs and sockets for portable appliances became available in the 1880s, to replace connections to light sockets with wall-mounted outlets. A proliferation of types developed for both convenience and protection from [[electrical injury]]. Today there are about 20 types in common use around the world, and many obsolete socket types are found in older buildings.  Coordination of technical standards has allowed some types of plug to be used across large regions to facilitate trade in electrical appliances, and for the convenience of travellers and consumers of imported electrical goods.\n\nSome multi-standard sockets allow use of several types of plug; improvised or unapproved adaptors between incompatible sockets balls and plugs may not provide the full safety and performance of an approved socket\u2013plug combination.\n\n==Concepts and terminology==\n{{multiple image\n| style=\"width:200px;\"| direction = vertical\n| image1 = Schuko plug and socket.png\n| image2 = French-power-socket.jpg\n| footer = Plugs and sockets may sometimes combine male and female contacts. Clockwise from top left: CEE 7/4 (German) plug; a matching CEE 7/3 socket with exposed earth (ground) projections on circumference of socket; CEE 7/5 (French) socket with projecting earth pin. Typically no energy is supplied to any exposed pins or terminals on the socket, for safety.}}\n\nA plug is the movable connector attached to an electrically operated device, and the socket is fixed on equipment or a building structure and connected to an energised electrical circuit. The plug is a [[gender of connectors and fasteners|''male'']] connector with protruding pins that match the openings and ''female'' contacts in a socket. Some plugs have female contacts that are used only for an [[ground (electricity)|earth ground connection]]. Some plugs have built-in [[Fuse (electrical)|fuses]] for safety.\n\nTo reduce the risk of [[electric shock]], plug and socket systems have safety features in addition to the recessed contacts of the energised socket. These may include plugs with [[insulator (electricity)|insulated]] sleeves, recessed sockets, or automatic shutters to block socket apertures when a plug is removed.\n\nA socket may be surrounded by a decorative or protective cover<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=HJEPglsuKN8C&pg=PT68 ''Smart Guide Wiring: step-by-step projects''], Fran J. Donegan, Creative Homeowner Press, 2004, p.74 (retrieved 2 February 2012 from Google Books)</ref> which may be integral with the socket.\n\n[[single-phase electric power|Single-phase]] sockets have two current-carrying connections to the power supply circuit, and may also have a third pin for a safety connection to earth ground. Depending on the supply system, one or both current-carrying connections may have significant voltage to earth ground.\n\n{{main|History of AC power plugs and sockets}}\nWhen commercial electric power was first introduced in the 1880s, it was used primarily for lighting. Other portable appliances (such as vacuum cleaners, electric fans, smoothing irons, and curling-tong heaters) were connected to light-bulb sockets.\n\nAs early as 1885 a two-pin plug and wall socket format was available on the British market. By about 1910 the first three-pin earthed (grounded) plugs appeared. Over time other safety improvements were gradually introduced to the market. The earliest national standard for plug and wall socket forms was set in 1915. {{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n== Application issues ==\n[[File:World map of electrical mains power plug types used.svg|thumb|500px|Types of power plugs and sockets used by country.]]\nDesigns of plugs and sockets have gradually developed to reduce the risk of electric shock and fire. Plugs are shaped to prevent finger contact with live parts, and sockets may be recessed. Some types can also include [[Fuse (electrical)|fuses]] and switches.\n\n===Shutters===\nShutters on the socket prevents foreign objects from contacting live contacts. The first shuttered socket was introduced by British manufacturer Crompton, in 1893.  Electrical insulation of the pin shanks to reduce live contact exposure was added to some designs, as early as 1905.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|title=The History of Electric Wiring|author=John Mellanby|date=1957|publisher=Macdonald|place=London}}</ref>\n\n===Earthing (grounding)===\nA third contact for a connection to [[Ground (electricity)|earth]] is intended to protect against insulation failure of the connected device. Some early unearthed plug and socket types were revised to include an earthing pin or phased out in favour of earthed types. The plug is often designed so that the earth ground contact connects before the energized circuit contacts.\n\nThe assigned IEC [[appliance classes|appliance class]] is governed by the requirement for earthing or equivalent protection. Class I equipment requires an earth contact in the plug and socket, while Class II equipment is unearthed and protects the user with [[double insulation]].\n\n==={{anchor|Polarization}} Polarization===\n{{main|Electrical polarity}}\nWhere a [[Ground and neutral|\"neutral\"]] conductor exists in supply wiring, polarization of the plug can improve safety by preserving the distinction in the equipment. For example, appliances may ensure that switches interrupt the line side of the circuit, or can connect the shell of a screw-base lampholder to neutral to reduce electric shock hazard. In some designs, polarized plugs cannot be mated with non-polarized sockets. Wiring systems where both circuit conductors have a significant potential with respect to earth, do not benefit from polarized plugs.\n\n===Universal sockets ===\n\"Universal\" or \"multi-standard\" sockets are intended to accommodate plugs of various types.  In some jurisdictions, they violate safety standards for sockets.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.spring.gov.sg/Building-Trust/Raising-Confidence/Safety-Tips-Alerts/Product-Safety-Alerts/Documents/SafetyAlert_Universal_Portable_Socket_Outlets.pdf |title=Alert noting non-compliant power strips |year=2009 |format=PDF |access-date=25 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306184839/https://www.spring.gov.sg/Building-Trust/Raising-Confidence/Safety-Tips-Alerts/Product-Safety-Alerts/Documents/SafetyAlert_Universal_Portable_Socket_Outlets.pdf |archive-date=6 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pucsl.gov.lk/english/news/sri-lanka-sets-national-standard-for-plugs-and-socket-outlets-for-non-industrial-applications-2/ |title=Sri Lanka Sets National Standard for Plugs and Socket Outlets |website=Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka |access-date=25 October 2019 |quote=Standardized on Type G; sale of non-compliant sockets is banned as of August, 2018, and buildings must re-wire by August, 2038.}}{{Dead link|date=October 2019}}</ref>\n\nSafety advocates, the United States Army<ref name=\"jennings\">{{cite web |url=http://www.almc.army.mil/alog/issues/MayJune12/Elelectrical_Safety.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223190700/http://www.almc.army.mil/alog/issues/MayJune12/Elelectrical_Safety.html |archive-date=23 February 2015 |author= James S.

Universal sockets may not meet technical standards for durability, plug retention force, temperature rise of components, or other performance requirements, as they are outside the scope of national and international technical standards.\n\nA technical standard may include compatibility of a socket with more than one form of plug. The Thai dual socket is specified in figure 4 of TIS 166-2549 (shown below) and is designed to accept Thai plugs, and also Type A, B and C plugs. Chinese dual sockets have both an unearthed socket complying with figure 5 of GB 1002-2008 (both flat pin and 4.8&nbsp;mm round pin), and an earthed socket complying with figure 4 of GB 1002-2008. The exception is that both Thai and Chinese dual sockets also accept 120&nbsp;V rated plugs, potentially causing an electrical incompatibility because both states use a 220&nbsp;V residential voltage.\n\n<gallery class=center>\nFile:Multi plug.jpg|A so-called 'universal socket', which meets no standard<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.extron.com/download/files/userman/Universal_AC_Outlet_68-1638-01_F.pdf |title=Universal AC Outlet \u2022 Setup Guide |publisher=Extron Electronics |location=Anaheim, CA|format=PDF |date=November 2017 |id=68-1638-01 Rev.

Although it may accept NEMA plugs, the Thai voltage is 220&nbsp;V and thus electrically incompatible with US devices.\nFile:Chinasocket.jpg|Chinese dual socket accepting both unearthed 2-pin (upper) and earthed 3-pin (lower) plugs.\n</gallery>\n{{Clear left}}\n\n===Voltage rating of plugs and power cords===\n[[File:NEMA Plug Ratings.jpg|thumb|NEMA 5-15 (type B) plugs with current and voltage ratings shown (left) on label (7 A 125 V) and (centre) on engagement face (10 A 125 V).  Also shown (right) is the rating on the C13 connector at the other end of the 10 A 125 V appliance cord.]]\nPlugs and [[power cord]]s have a rated voltage and current assigned to them by the manufacturer. Using a plug or power cord that is inappropriate for the load may be a safety hazard. For example, high-current equipment can cause a fire when plugged into an extension cord with a current rating lower than necessary. Sometimes the cords used to plug in dual voltage 120 V / 240 V equipment are rated only for 125 V, so care must be taken by travellers to use only cords with an appropriate voltage rating.\n\n===Appliance connections and extensions===\nSo that manufacturers need not build many similar appliances differing only in the type of plug fitted, a common strategy is to provide an [[IEC 60320]] inlet on the appliance and a detachable [[power cord]] (mains flex lead) and appropriate plug. The appliance need only to be tested to the power inlet. Some appliances have a switch for selection of voltage.  \n[[File:Tricklestar Plug Strip.jpg|thumb|A plug strip with 2 USB ports and built in [[Surge protector|surge protection]]]]\n[[Extension cord]]s (extension leads) are used for temporary connections when a socket is not within convenient reach of an appliance's power lead. A [[power strip]] with multiple sockets may also have a switch, surge voltage protection, or over-current protection.\n\n===Special purpose plugs and sockets===\nSpecial purpose sockets may be found in residential, industrial, commercial or institutional buildings. Examples of systems using special purpose sockets include:\n* \"Clean\" (low electrical noise) earth for use with computer systems,\n* [[Emergency power system|Emergency power supply]],\n* [[Uninterruptible power supply]] for critical or life-support equipment,\n* Isolated power for medical instruments, tools used in wet conditions, or electric razors,\n* [[Split-phase electric power#Balanced power|\"Balanced\" or \"technical\"]] power used in audio and video production studios,\n* [[Stage lighting|Theatrical lighting]],\n* [[IEC 60309]] (CEE 17) \"plugs, socket-outlets and couplers for industrial purposes\", used as a weather-resistant connector for [[Caravan (towed trailer)|Caravans]], [[Motorhome]]s, [[camper van]]s and [[tent]]s for mains hook-up at [[camp-site]]s.<ref>[https://www.campingandcaravanningclub.co.uk/helpandadvice/technicalhelp/datasheets/electricity-campers-caravanners/ Using electricity on a campsite] [[Camping and Caravanning Club]]</ref><ref>[https://www.campingandcaravanningclub.co.uk/travelabroad/camping-in-europe/european-campsites/electricity/ Electricity on European Campsites] [[Camping and Caravanning Club]] (UK, so \"European\" means mainland Europe)</ref>\n* Sockets for electric clothes dryers, electric ovens, and air conditioners with higher current rating.\n\nSpecial-purpose sockets may be labelled or coloured to identify a reserved use of a system, or may have keys or specially shaped pins to prevent use of unintended equipment.\n\n==={{anchor|shaver}}Shaver supply units===\n[[File:ShaverSocketUK.jpg|thumb|110px|Shaver supply unit for BS&nbsp;4573, US Type A, Australian two-pin, and Europlug Type C.]]\nNational wiring regulations sometimes prohibit the use of sockets adjacent to water taps, etc.  A special socket, with an [[isolation transformer]], may allow electric razors to be used near a sink. Because the isolation transformer is of low rating, such outlets are not suitable to operate higher-powered appliances such as [[blow dryer]]s.\n\nAn IEC standard 61558-2-5, adopted by [[CENELEC]] and as a national standard in some countries, describes one type of shaver supply unit. Shaver sockets may accept multiple two-pin plug types including Europlug (Type C), Australian (Type I) and [[BS&nbsp;4573]]. The isolation transformer often includes a 115&nbsp;V output accepting two-pin US plugs (Type A). Shaver supply units must also be current limited, IEC&nbsp;61558-2-5 specifies a minimum rating of 20&nbsp;[[Volt-ampere|VA]] and maximum of 50&nbsp;VA.<ref>IEC&nbsp;61558-2-5</ref> Sockets are marked with a shaver symbol, and may also say  \"shavers only\" .\n\nIsolation transformers and dedicated NEMA 1-15 shaver receptacles were once standard installation practice in North America, but now a [[GFCI]] receptacle is used instead. This provides the full capacity of a standard receptacle but protects the user of a razor or other appliance from leakage current.\n\n==Types in present use==\n\nThe plugs and sockets used in a given area are regulated by local governments.\n\nThe [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) maintains a guide with letter designations for generally compatible types of plugs,<ref name=\"World Plugs\">[http://www.iec.ch/worldplugs/ World Plugs] Retrieved on 27 March 2015.</ref> which expands on earlier guides published by the [[United States Department of Commerce]]. This is a ''de facto'' naming standard and guide to travellers. Some letter types correspond to several current ratings or different technical standards, so the letter does not uniquely identify a plug and socket within the type family, nor guarantee compatibility. Physical compatibility of the plug and socket does not ensure correct voltage, frequency, or current capacity. Not all plug and socket families have letters in the IEC guide, but those that have are noted in this article, as are some additional letters commonly used by retail vendors.<ref name=ECO>The letter system first appeared in such guides in 1967 ([http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b4263654 ''Electric Current Abroad''. [[United States Department of Commerce]], 1967]. Retrieved on 14 December 2013.) which designated types A 2-pin US, B (BS 546), and C (BS 1363). The 1984 edition ([http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b4263653 ''Electric Current Abroad''. [[United States Department of Commerce]], 1984]. Retrieved on 14 December 2013.) uses the letters A to G in the same manner as they are used today, and the last revision of the print series was in 1998 ({{cite web | title = Electric Current Abroad | url = http://trade.gov/publications/pdfs/current2002FINAL.pdf | publisher = US Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration (retrieved 9 October 2015)| format = PDF | year = 2002}}). The [[International Trade Administration]] of the US Department of Commerce now publishes a web version: [http://www.trade.gov/mas/ian/ecw/ Electric Current Worldwide], which differs slightly from the IEC list and from Wikipedia's list at [[Mains electricity by country]].</ref>\n\nIn Europe, [[CENELEC]] publishes a list of approved plug and socket technical standards used in the member countries.<ref>ftp://ftp.cencenelec.eu/CENELEC/TCs/61/PlugsSockets.pdf Plugs and socket types in each CENELEC country, Retrieved 15 February 2012.</ref>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Argentina IRAM 2073 and 2071 (Type I)===\n[[File:IRAM 2073 arragment.png|thumb|upright|Argentinian 1996 power plug arrangement]]\n\nThe plug and socket system used in Class&nbsp;1 applications in Argentina is defined by [[Instituto Argentino de Normalizaci\u00f3n y Certificaci\u00f3n|IRAM]] standards. These two standards are; IRAM 2073 \"Two pole plugs with earthing contact for domestic and similar purposes, rated 10 A and 20 A, 250 V AC\" and IRAM 2071 \"Two pole socket \u2013 outlets with earthing contact for 10 A and 20 A, 250 V AC., for fixed installations.\" The plug and socket system is similar in appearance to the Australian and Chinese plugs. It has an earthing pin and two flat current-carrying pins forming an inverted V-shape (120\u00b0). The flat pins for the 10 A version measure {{convert |6.25|by|1.55|mm|in|3|abbr= on}} and {{convert |8.0|by|1.9|mm|in|3|abbr= on}} for the 20 A version, and are set at 30\u00b0 to the vertical at a nominal pitch of {{convert |7.92|mm|in|3|abbr= on}}. The pin length is the same as in the Chinese version. The earthing pin length is {{convert |21.4|mm|in|3|abbr= on}} for the 10 A version and {{convert |21.8|mm|in|3|abbr= on}} for the 20 A version. On the plugs, the pole length is {{convert |18.2|mm|in|3|abbr= on}} for the 10 A version and {{convert |17.8|mm|in|3|abbr= on}} for the 20 A version. The most important difference from the Australian plug is that the Argentinian plug is wired with the line and neutral contacts reversed.\n\nIn Brazil, similar plugs and sockets are still commonly used for high-power appliances like air conditioners, dishwashers, and household ovens. Although being often called \"Argentinian plug,\" it is actually based on the American NEMA 10-20 standard, and is incompatible{{how|title=[[AS/NZS 3112]] states Argentinian, Australian and [[NEMA 10]] plugs are physically compatible|date=August 2019}} with Argentinian IRAM plugs. Since Brazil adopted the NBR 14136 standard which includes a 20 A version, the original motivation to use the NEMA 10-20 plug has ceased to exist.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n=== Australian/New Zealand standard AS/NZS 3112 (Type I), used in Australasia ===\n{{Details|AS/NZS 3112}}\n[[File:Aust AC plug.jpg|thumb|upright|Standard Australian 10&nbsp;A power plug with insulated pins]]\n[[File:Australian Dual Socket Outlet.jpg|thumb|left|Australasian switched 3-pin (10&nbsp;A) dual socket outlet]]\nThis Australian/New Zealand standard is used in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Tonga, Solomon Islands, and Papua New Guinea. It defines a plug with an earthing pin, and two flat current-carrying pins which form an inverted V-shape.<ref>AS/NZS 3112:2004, ''Approval and test specification&nbsp;\u2013 Plugs and socket-outlets'', [[Standards Australia]] and Standards New Zealand</ref> The flat pins measure {{convert |6.5|by|1.6|mm|in|3|abbr= on}} and are set at 30\u00b0 to the vertical at a nominal pitch of {{convert|13.7|mm|in|3|abbr=on}}. Australian and New Zealand wall sockets almost always have switches on them for extra safety, as in the UK. An unearthed version of this plug with two angled power pins but no earthing pin is used with double-insulated appliances, but the sockets always include an earth contact.\n\nThere are several AS/NZS 3112 plug variants, including ones with larger or differently shaped pins used for devices drawing 15, 20, 25 and 32 [[ampere|A]]. These sockets accept plugs of equal or lower current rating, but not higher. For example, a 10&nbsp;A plug will fit all sockets but a 20&nbsp;A plug will fit only 20, 25 and 32 A sockets. In New Zealand, PDL 940 \"tap-on\" or \"piggy-back\" plugs are available which allow a second 10&nbsp;A plug to be fitted to the rear of the plug. In Australia these piggy-back plugs are now available only on pre-made extension leads.\n\nAustralia's standard plug/socket system was originally codified as standard C112 (floated provisionally in 1937, and adopted as a formal standard in 1938), which was superseded by [[AS 3112|AS&nbsp;3112]] in 1990. The requirement for insulated pins was introduced in the 2004 revision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accesscomms.com.au/reference/insulated-pins.htm |title= Mains Plugs with Insulated Pins.

NBR 14136 does not require shutters on the apertures, a further aspect of non-compliance with IEC 60906-1. NBR 14136 was not enforced in that country until 2007, when its adoption was made optional for manufacturers. It became compulsory on 1 January 2010.\n\nFew private houses in Brazil have an earthed supply, so even if a three-pin socket is present it is not safe to assume that all three terminals are actually connected. Most large domestic appliances were sold with the option to fit a flying earth tail to be locally earthed, but many consumers were unsure how to use this and so didn't connect it. The new standard has an earth pin, which in theory eliminates the need for the flying earth tail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inmetro.gov.br/qualidade/pluguestomadas/perguntas.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 December 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305013445/http://www.inmetro.gov.br/qualidade/pluguestomadas/perguntas.asp |archivedate=5 March 2016  }} 9) Aquele fiozinho que tem pendurado atr\u00e1s da minha geladeira, vai desaparecer?</ref>\n\n{{gallery\n|width=200 |height=150\n|align=center\n|lines=3\n|File:NBR 14136 plugs and outlet.jpg | Brazilian 10 ampere socket and plugs\n|File:Tomada_Brasileira_-_NBR_14136,_20A,_250V.jpg| Brazilian 20 ampere socket}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n===British and compatible standards===\n{{Main|AC power plugs and sockets - British and related types}}\n\n====BS 546 and related types (Type D and M)====\n<!-- \neditors: Additional details should be added to [[AC power plugs and sockets - British and related types]]. \n-->\n[[File:BS 546 Plugs - 15A 5A 2A.png|thumb|BS 546 plugs.

Today, sockets without switch are allowed, but then it is a requirement that the sockets have a cavity to prevent touching the live pins. The shape of the plugs generally makes it difficult to touch the pins when connecting/disconnecting.\n\nSince the early 1990s earthed sockets have been required in all new electric installations in Denmark.

The electricity on the two supplies was separately metered, was sold at different tariffs, was taxed differently and was supplied through separate and different sockets.{{sfn|De Cesco|1975|pp=56\u201357}} Even though the two electric lines (and respective tariffs) were gradually unified beginning in the 1960s (the official, but purely theoretical date was the summer of 1974){{sfn|De Cesco|1975|p=93}} many houses had dual wiring and two electricity meters for years thereafter; in some zones of Lazio the 127&nbsp;V network was provided for lighting until 1999. The two gauges for plugs and sockets thus became a [[de facto standard]] which is now formalized under CEI&nbsp;23-50. Some older installations have sockets that are limited to either the 10&nbsp;A or the 16&nbsp;A style plug, requiring the use of an adaptor if the other gauge needs to be connected. Numerous cross adaptors were used.\n\nAlmost every appliance sold in Italy nowadays is equipped with CEE&nbsp;7/7 (German/French), CEE&nbsp;7/16 or CEE&nbsp;7/17 plugs, but the standard Italian sockets will not accept the first and the third ones since the pins of the CEE&nbsp;7/7 and CEE&nbsp;7/17 plugs are thicker (4.8&nbsp;mm) than the Italian ones (4&nbsp;mm); besides the pins are not sheathed and forcing them into a linear Italian socket may lead to electric shock. Adaptors are standardized in Italy under CEI&nbsp;23-57 which can be used to connect CEE&nbsp;7/7 and CEE&nbsp;7/17 and plugs to linear CEI&nbsp;23-50 sockets.\n\nEuroplugs are also in common use in Italy; they are standardized under CEI&nbsp;23-34 S 1 for use with the 10&nbsp;A socket and can be found fitted to Class II appliances with low current requirement (less than 2.5&nbsp;A).\n\nThe current Italian standards provide for sockets to have child-resistant shutters (\"Sicury\" patent).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vimar.de/de/de/article/article/detail/id/1259 |title=Bestreben Nach Sicherheit &#124; Vimar |publisher=Vimar.de |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Italian multiple standard sockets====\n{{multiple image\n | width=150\n | image1=Adapted schuko.jpg\n | caption1= CEI&nbsp;23-50&nbsp;17/11 (''Bipasso'') socket (#1) and CEI&nbsp;23-50 P&nbsp;40 (Italian adapted ''Schuko'') (#2) in a modern installation.\n | image2=VIMAR_universale.jpg\n | caption2= Italian ''Vimar universale'' socket accepting CEE&nbsp;7/4 (German), CEE&nbsp;7/7 (German/French), CEE&nbsp;7/16 (Europlug), CEE&nbsp;7/17 (German/French unearthed), NEMA&nbsp;1-15 (US/Japan), CEI 23-50&nbsp;S&nbsp;11&nbsp;(10&nbsp;A) and S&nbsp;17&nbsp;(16&nbsp;A) Italian plugs.\n | image3=4box side 4B.AM.H21 28-14.jpg\n | caption3=''4box side'' socket combining 1 Schuko and 2 CEI 23-50&nbsp;P 17/11 ''bipasso'' (Italian type plugs).\n}}\nIn modern installations in Italy (and in other countries where Type L plugs are used) it is usual to find sockets that can accept more than one standard.\n\nThe simplest type, designated CEI&nbsp;23-50 P&nbsp;17/11, has a central round hole flanked by two figure-8 shaped holes, allowing the insertion of CEI&nbsp;23-50 S&nbsp;10 (Italian 10&nbsp;A plug unearthed), CEI&nbsp;23-50 S&nbsp;11 (Italian 10&nbsp;A plug earthed), CEI&nbsp;23-50 S&nbsp;16 (Italian 16&nbsp;A plug unearthed), CEI&nbsp;23-50 S&nbsp;17 (Italian 16&nbsp;A plug earthed) and CEE 7/16 (Europlug).

Its drawback is that it is twice as large as a normal Italian socket, it does not accept 16&nbsp;A Italian plugs and the price is higher; for those reasons Schuko sockets have been rarely installed in Italy until recent times.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nOther types may push compatibility even further. The CEI&nbsp;23-50 P&nbsp;40 socket, which is quickly becoming the standard in Italy along with CEI&nbsp;23-50 P&nbsp;17/11, accepts CEE&nbsp;7/4, CEE&nbsp;7/7, CEE&nbsp;7/16, CEE&nbsp;7/17, CEI&nbsp;23-50 S&nbsp;10, CEI&nbsp;23-50 S&nbsp;11, CEI&nbsp;23-50 S&nbsp;16 and CEI 23-50&nbsp;S&nbsp;17 plugs; its drawback is that it does not accept SPA&nbsp;11, SPB&nbsp;11, SPA&nbsp;17 and SPB&nbsp;17 side-entry plugs; however almost no appliance is sold with these types, which are mainly used to replace existing plugs. The Vimar-brand ''universale'' (all purpose) socket accepts CEE&nbsp;7/4, CEE&nbsp;7/7, CEE&nbsp;7/16, CEE&nbsp;7/17, CEI&nbsp;23-50 S 10, CEI&nbsp;23-50 S 11, CEI&nbsp;23-50 S&nbsp;16, CEI 23-50&nbsp;S&nbsp;17 and also NEMA&nbsp;1-15 (US/Japan) plugs (older versions also had extra holes to accept UK shaver plugs).\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== North American and IEC 60906-2 ===\n{{main|NEMA connector}}\n\nMost of North America and Central America, and some of South America, use connectors standardized by the [[National Electrical Manufacturers Association]]. The devices are named using the format NEMA n-mmX, where ''n'' is an identifier for the configuration of pins and blades, ''mm'' is the maximum current rating, and ''X'' is either P for plug or R for receptacle. For example, NEMA 5-15R is a configuration type 5 receptacle supporting 15 A. Corresponding ''P'' and ''R'' versions are designed to be mated.  Within the series, the arrangement and size of pins will differ, to prevent accidental mating of devices with a higher current draw than the receptacle can support.\n\n==== NEMA 1-15 ungrounded (Type A) ====\n{{multiple image | footer = Polarized (left) and unpolarized NEMA 1-15 plugs | image1 = NEMA-1 plug polarized.agr.jpg | width1 = 180 | image2 = A plug.jpg | width2 = 240 }}\nNEMA-1 plugs have two parallel blades and are rated 15 A at 125 volts. They provide no ground connection but will fit a grounding NEMA 5-15 receptacle. Early versions were not polarized, but most plugs are polarized today via a wider neutral blade. (Unpolarized [[AC adaptor]]s are a common exception.)\n\nHarvey Hubbell patented a parallel blade plug in 1913, where the blades were equal width (US patent 1064833<ref>{{cite patent |url=http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=01064833|title=Separable Attachment Plug|number=1064833 |gdate=17 June 1913 |inventor=Harvey Hubbell |accessdate=4 June 2018 |status=patent |country=US}}</ref>). In 1916 Hubbell received a further patent for a polarized version where one blade was both longer and wider than the other (US patent 1180648<ref>{{cite patent |url=http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=01180648|title=Attachment Plug|number=1180648|gdate=25 April 1916|inventor=Harvey Hubbell |accessdate=19 February 2017|status=patent |country=US}}</ref>), in the polarized version of NEMA 1-15 both blades are the same length, only the width varies.\n\nUngrounded NEMA-1 outlets are not permitted in new construction in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], but can still be found in older buildings.\n\n==== NEMA 5-15 grounded (Type B) ====\n{{multiple image | footer = NEMA 5-15 plug, left. \"Decora\"-style duplex socket, with orientation as specified in NECA 130-2010, centre.

Physical compatibility does not ensure that the appliance and socket match in frequency or voltage. Adaptors allow travellers to connect devices to foreign sockets, but do not change voltage or frequency. A [[voltage converter]] is required for electrical compatibility in places with a different voltage than the device is designed for. Mismatch in frequency between supply and appliances may still cause problems even at the correct voltage.\n\n===Multisocket adaptors===\nMultisocket adaptors allow the connection of two or more plugs to a single socket. They are manufactured in various configurations, depending on the country and the region in which they are used, with various ratings. In Europe for example, they are called double or triple adaptors, and transform one socket into a multiple socket. This allows connecting more than one electrical consumer item to one single socket and is mainly used for low power devices (TV sets, table lamps, computers, etc.). They are usually rated at 6&nbsp;A 250&nbsp;V, 10&nbsp;A 250&nbsp;V, or 16&nbsp;A 250&nbsp;V, however this is the general rating of the adaptor (for example, if we have an adaptor for four sockets and it is marked 16&nbsp;A 250&nbsp;V, this means that the adaptor should not be loaded more than 16&nbsp;A, whether one, two, three or all sockets are used. Some people overload them, thus leading to accidents). In some countries these adaptors are banned and are not available in shops, as they may lead to fires due to overloading them. Adaptors can be made with ceramic, Bakelite, or other plastic bodies.\n\n==Unusual types==\n{{for|obsolete types|History of AC power plugs and sockets#Obsolete types}}\n\n===Lampholder plug===\n[[File:Lampholder plugs.jpg|thumb|left | Italian bypass lampholder plugs with Edison screw mount. Left: early type (porcelain and brass, c. 1930); right: late type (black plastic, c. 1970)]]\n\nA lampholder plug fits into a light socket in place of a [[light bulb]] to connect appliances to lighting circuits. Where a lower rate was applied to electric power used for lighting circuits, lampholder plugs enabled the consumers to reduce their electricity costs. Lampholder plugs are rarely fused. Edison screw lampholder adaptors (for NEMA 1-15 plugs) are still commonly used in the Americas.\n\n===Soviet adaptor plugs===\n[[File:Soviet power plug.JPG|thumb|left|Soviet adaptor plug]]\nSome appliances sold in the Soviet Union had a flat unearthed plug with an additional pass-through socket on the top, allowing a stacked arrangement of plugs. This design was very useful, because the usual Soviet apartment of the 1960s had very few sockets, but somewhat unsafe; the brass cylinders of the secondary socket were uncovered at the ends (to allow them to be unscrewed easily), recessed by only 3&nbsp;mm, and provided bad contact because they relied on the secondary plug's bisected expanding pins. The pins of the secondary plug (which lacked insulation sleeves) could not be inserted into the cylindrical sockets completely, leaving a 5&nbsp;mm gap between the primary and secondary plugs. The adaptors were mostly used for low power appliances (for example, connecting both a table lamp and a radio to a socket).\n{{clear}}\n\n===UK Walsall Gauge plug===\n[[File:WG13 PICT6943.jpg|thumb|Walsall Gauge 13 A plug (bottom) compared to regular BS 1363 plug]]\n\nUnlike the standard BS&nbsp;1363 plugs found in the UK, the earth pin is on a horizontal axis and the live and neutral pins on a vertical axis. This style of plug/socket was used by university laboratories (from batteries) and the [[BBC]], and is still in use on parts of the [[London Underground]] for 110 V AC voltage supply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plugsocketmuseum.nl/British2.html|title=Non-standard BS 1363 types|work=Museum of Plugs and Sockets|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=3 November 2019}}</ref> In the 1960s they were used for 240 V DC in the Power laboratory of the Electrical Engineering department of what was then University College, Cardiff. Power was supplied by the public 240 V DC mains which remained available in addition to the 240 V AC mains until circa 1969, and thereafter from in-house rectifiers. They were also used in the [[Ministry of Defence Main Building (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence Main Building]] on circuits powered from the standby generators to stop staff from plugging in unauthorised devices. They were also known to be used in some British Rail offices for the same reason.\n\n===Italian BTicino brand Magic security connector===\n{{multiple images\n|align = left\n|image1 = Bticino Magic 1.jpg\n|width1 = 56\n|image2 = Bticino Magic 2.jpg\n|width2 = 100\n|image3 = Bticino Magic 3.jpg\n|width3 = 100\n|footer = Left: Bticino Magic Security socket, detail.<br />Centre: assortment of Magic Security sockets (in orange, the industrial three-phase type).<br />Right: assortment of Magic Security plugs.\n}}\n\nThe Italian manufacturer BTicino in the 1960s introduced an alternative to the Europlug or CEI&nbsp;23-16 connectors then in use.{{sfn|De Cesco|1975|p=73}} The socket is rectangular, with lateral key pins and indentations to maintain polarization, and to prevent insertion of a plug with different current ratings. Three single-phase general purpose connectors were rated 10&nbsp;A, 16&nbsp;A and 20&nbsp;A; and a three-phase industrial connector rated 10&nbsp;A; all of them have different key-pin positioning so plugs and sockets cannot be mismatched.{{sfn|De Cesco|1975|p=75}} The socket is closed by a safety lid (bearing the word \u2018'Magic'\u2019 on it) which can be opened only with an even pressure on its surface, thus preventing the insertion of objects (except the plug itself) inside the socket. The contacts are positioned on both sides of the plug; the plug is energised only when it is inserted fully into the socket.\n\n[[File:Spina magic 02.jpg|thumb|On the left a BTicino Magic Security plug (10&nbsp;A), on the right a type L to Magic Security plug adaptor]]\n\nThe system is not compatible with Italian CEI plugs, nor with Europlugs. Appliances were never sold fitted with these security plugs, and the use of adaptors would defeat the safety features, so the supplied plugs had to be cut off and replaced with the security connector. Even so, the ''Magic'' security system had some success at first because its enhanced safety features appealed to customers; standard connectors of the day were considered not safe enough.{{sfn|De Cesco|1975|p=73}} The decline of the system occurred when safety lids similar to the Magic type were developed<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vimar.eu/index.php?l=it&module=articles&class=articles&event=__default&menu_item_id=134&content=20 |title=La ricerca della sicurezza. Il brevetto Sicury |website=www.vimar.eu. |access-date=12 February 2009}}</ref> for standard sockets.\n\nIn Italy, the system was never definitively abandoned. Though very rarely seen today, it is still marked as available in BTicino\u2019s catalogue,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bticino.assetbank-server.com/bticino/assetfile/50782.pdf |website=bticino.assetbank-server.com |title=Il Classico Dell\u2019Installazione Civile |access-date=20 May 2017}}</ref> (except for the three-phase version, which stopped production in July 2011).\n\nIn Chile, 10&nbsp;A Magic connectors are commonly used for computer/laboratory power networks, as well as for communications or data equipment. This allows delicate electronics equipment to be connected to an independent circuit breaker, usually including a [[surge protector]] or an [[uninterruptible power supply]] backup. The different style of plug makes it more difficult for office workers to connect computer equipment to a standard unprotected power line, or to overload the UPS by connecting other office appliances.\n\nIn Iceland, Magic plugs were widely used in homes and businesses alongside Europlug and Schuko installations. Their installation in new homes was still quite common even in the late 1980s.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Single phase electric stove plugs and sockets==\n[[File:Power connector Legrand 32A.jpg|thumb|left|Plug (sheet V) and socket (sheet VI) to French standard NF&nbsp;C&nbsp;61-315 (400 V, 32 A)]]\n{{multiple image | footer = Russian stove connectors rated 250&nbsp;V 25&nbsp;A AC.

If not hardwired to the supply, electric stoves may be connected to the mains with an appropriate high power connector. Some countries do not have wiring regulations for single-phase electric stoves. In Russia an electric stove can often be seen connected with a 25 to 32&nbsp;A connector.\n\nIn Norway and parts of Sweden a 25 A grounded connector, rectangular shaped with rounded corners, is used for single phase stoves. The connector has three rectangular pins in a row, with the grounding pin longer than other two. The corresponding socket is recessed to prevent shocks. The Norwegian standard is NEK&nbsp;502:2005 \u2013 standard sheet X (socket) and sheet XI (plug). They are also known as the two pole and earth variants of CEE&nbsp;7/10 (socket) and CEE&nbsp;7/11 (plug).\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n{{div col|colwidth=23em}}\n* [[DC connector]]\n* [[IEC 60309]] high-power industrial and polyphase connectors\n* [[IEC 60320]] appliance connectors\n* [[Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets]]\n* [[Mains electricity]]\n* [[Mains electricity by country]] lists voltage, frequency, and connector types for over 200 countries\n* [[Plug load]]\n* [[Polyphase system]]\n* [[Stage pin connector]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Mains connectors}}\n{{Wikibooks|Guide to electrical equipment for travellers}}\n* [http://www.plugsocketmuseum.nl/ Digital Museum of Plugs and Sockets] (comprehensive collection of plugs and sockets)\n* [http://www.electropedia.org Glossary of standards terms]\n* [https://www.gewinde-normen.de/en/e-thread.html Edison thread]\n\n{{Electronic components}}\n\n[[Category:Electrical standards]]\n[[Category:Electrical wiring]]\n[[Category:Mains power connectors]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|[[mains electricity|mains]] power connection devices used in domestic and light commercial environments|other types|Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{use British English|date=September 2012}}\n{{Electrical Wiring Sidebar}}\n\n'''AC power plugs and sockets''' connect electric equipment to the [[alternating current]] (AC) [[mains electricity|power supply]] in buildings and at other sites. Electrical plugs and sockets differ from one another in [[voltage]] and [[electric current|current]] rating, shape, size, and connector type. Different standard systems of plugs and sockets are used around the world.\n\nPlugs and sockets for portable appliances became available in the 1880s, to replace connections to light sockets with wall-mounted outlets. A proliferation of types developed for both convenience and protection from [[electrical injury]]. Today there are about 20 types in common use around the world, and many obsolete socket types are found in older buildings.  Coordination of technical standards has allowed some types of plug to be used across large regions to facilitate trade in electrical appliances, and for the convenience of travellers and consumers of imported electrical goods.\n\nSome multi-standard sockets allow use of several types of plug; improvised or unapproved adaptors between incompatible sockets and plugs may not provide the full safety and performance of an approved socket\u2013plug combination.\n\n==Concepts and terminology==\n{{multiple image\n| style=\"width:200px;\"| direction = vertical\n| image1 = Schuko plug and socket.png\n| image2 = French-power-socket.jpg\n| footer = Plugs and sockets may sometimes combine male and female contacts. Clockwise from top left: CEE 7/4 (German) plug; a matching CEE 7/3 socket with exposed earth (ground) projections on circumference of socket; CEE 7/5 (French) socket with projecting earth pin. Typically no energy is supplied to any exposed pins or terminals on the socket, for safety.}}\n\nA plug is the movable connector attached to an electrically operated device, and the socket is fixed on equipment or a building structure and connected to an energised electrical circuit. The plug is a [[gender of connectors and fasteners|''male'']] connector with protruding pins that match the openings and ''female'' contacts in a socket. Some plugs have female contacts that are used only for an [[ground (electricity)|earth ground connection]]. Some plugs have built-in [[Fuse (electrical)|fuses]] for safety.\n\nTo reduce the risk of [[electric shock]], plug and socket systems have safety features in addition to the recessed contacts of the energised socket. These may include plugs with [[insulator (electricity)|insulated]] sleeves, recessed sockets, or automatic shutters to block socket apertures when a plug is removed.\n\nA socket may be surrounded by a decorative or protective cover<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=HJEPglsuKN8C&pg=PT68 ''Smart Guide Wiring: step-by-step projects''], Fran J. Donegan, Creative Homeowner Press, 2004, p.74 (retrieved 2 February 2012 from Google Books)</ref> which may be integral with the socket.\n\n[[single-phase electric power|Single-phase]] sockets have two current-carrying connections to the power supply circuit, and may also have a third pin for a safety connection to earth ground. Depending on the supply system, one or both current-carrying connections may have significant voltage to earth ground.\n\n{{main|History of AC power plugs and sockets}}\nWhen commercial electric power was first introduced in the 1880s, it was used primarily for lighting. Other portable appliances (such as vacuum cleaners, electric fans, smoothing irons, and curling-tong heaters) were connected to light-bulb sockets.\n\nAs early as 1885 a two-pin plug and wall socket format was available on the British market. By about 1910 the first three-pin earthed (grounded) plugs appeared. Over time other safety improvements were gradually introduced to the market. The earliest national standard for plug and wall socket forms was set in 1915. {{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n== Application issues ==\n[[File:World map of electrical mains power plug types used.svg|thumb|500px|Types of power plugs and sockets used by country.]]\nDesigns of plugs and sockets have gradually developed to reduce the risk of electric shock and fire. Plugs are shaped to prevent finger contact with live parts, and sockets may be recessed. Some types can also include [[Fuse (electrical)|fuses]] and switches.\n\n===Shutters===\nShutters on the socket prevents foreign objects from contacting live contacts. The first shuttered socket was introduced by British manufacturer Crompton, in 1893.  Electrical insulation of the pin shanks to reduce live contact exposure was added to some designs, as early as 1905.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|title=The History of Electric Wiring|author=John Mellanby|date=1957|publisher=Macdonald|place=London}}</ref>\n\n===Earthing (grounding)===\nA third contact for a connection to [[Ground (electricity)|earth]] is intended to protect against insulation failure of the connected device. Some early unearthed plug and socket types were revised to include an earthing pin or phased out in favour of earthed types. The plug is often designed so that the earth ground contact connects before the energized circuit contacts.\n\nThe assigned IEC [[appliance classes|appliance class]] is governed by the requirement for earthing or equivalent protection. Class I equipment requires an earth contact in the plug and socket, while Class II equipment is unearthed and protects the user with [[double insulation]].\n\n==={{anchor|Polarization}} Polarization===\n{{main|Electrical polarity}}\nWhere a [[Ground and neutral|\"neutral\"]] conductor exists in supply wiring, polarization of the plug can improve safety by preserving the distinction in the equipment. For example, appliances may ensure that switches interrupt the line side of the circuit, or can connect the shell of a screw-base lampholder to neutral to reduce electric shock hazard. In some designs, polarized plugs cannot be mated with non-polarized sockets. Wiring systems where both circuit conductors have a significant potential with respect to earth, do not benefit from polarized plugs.\n\n===Universal sockets ===\n\"Universal\" or \"multi-standard\" sockets are intended to accommodate plugs of various types.  In some jurisdictions, they violate safety standards for sockets.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.spring.gov.sg/Building-Trust/Raising-Confidence/Safety-Tips-Alerts/Product-Safety-Alerts/Documents/SafetyAlert_Universal_Portable_Socket_Outlets.pdf |title=Alert noting non-compliant power strips |year=2009 |format=PDF |access-date=25 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306184839/https://www.spring.gov.sg/Building-Trust/Raising-Confidence/Safety-Tips-Alerts/Product-Safety-Alerts/Documents/SafetyAlert_Universal_Portable_Socket_Outlets.pdf |archive-date=6 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pucsl.gov.lk/english/news/sri-lanka-sets-national-standard-for-plugs-and-socket-outlets-for-non-industrial-applications-2/ |title=Sri Lanka Sets National Standard for Plugs and Socket Outlets |website=Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka |access-date=25 October 2019 |quote=Standardized on Type G; sale of non-compliant sockets is banned as of August, 2018, and buildings must re-wire by August, 2038.}}{{Dead link|date=October 2019}}</ref>\n\nSafety advocates, the United States Army<ref name=\"jennings\">{{cite web |url=http://www.almc.army.mil/alog/issues/MayJune12/Elelectrical_Safety.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223190700/http://www.almc.army.mil/alog/issues/MayJune12/Elelectrical_Safety.html |archive-date=23 February 2015 |author= James S.

Universal sockets may not meet technical standards for durability, plug retention force, temperature rise of components, or other performance requirements, as they are outside the scope of national and international technical standards.\n\nA technical standard may include compatibility of a socket with more than one form of plug. The Thai dual socket is specified in figure 4 of TIS 166-2549 (shown below) and is designed to accept Thai plugs, and also Type A, B and C plugs. Chinese dual sockets have both an unearthed socket complying with figure 5 of GB 1002-2008 (both flat pin and 4.8&nbsp;mm round pin), and an earthed socket complying with figure 4 of GB 1002-2008. The exception is that both Thai and Chinese dual sockets also accept 120&nbsp;V rated plugs, potentially causing an electrical incompatibility because both states use a 220&nbsp;V residential voltage.\n\n<gallery class=center>\nFile:Multi plug.jpg|A so-called 'universal socket', which meets no standard<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.extron.com/download/files/userman/Universal_AC_Outlet_68-1638-01_F.pdf |title=Universal AC Outlet \u2022 Setup Guide |publisher=Extron Electronics |location=Anaheim, CA|format=PDF |date=November 2017 |id=68-1638-01 Rev.

Although it may accept NEMA plugs, the Thai voltage is 220&nbsp;V and thus electrically incompatible with US devices.\nFile:Chinasocket.jpg|Chinese dual socket accepting both unearthed 2-pin (upper) and earthed 3-pin (lower) plugs.\n</gallery>\n{{Clear left}}\n\n===Voltage rating of plugs and power cords===\n[[File:NEMA Plug Ratings.jpg|thumb|NEMA 5-15 (type B) plugs with current and voltage ratings shown (left) on label (7 A 125 V) and (centre) on engagement face (10 A 125 V).  Also shown (right) is the rating on the C13 connector at the other end of the 10 A 125 V appliance cord.]]\nPlugs and [[power cord]]s have a rated voltage and current assigned to them by the manufacturer. Using a plug or power cord that is inappropriate for the load may be a safety hazard. For example, high-current equipment can cause a fire when plugged into an extension cord with a current rating lower than necessary. Sometimes the cords used to plug in dual voltage 120 V / 240 V equipment are rated only for 125 V, so care must be taken by travellers to use only cords with an appropriate voltage rating.\n\n===Appliance connections and extensions===\nSo that manufacturers need not build many similar appliances differing only in the type of plug fitted, a common strategy is to provide an [[IEC 60320]] inlet on the appliance and a detachable [[power cord]] (mains flex lead) and appropriate plug. The appliance need only to be tested to the power inlet. Some appliances have a switch for selection of voltage.  \n[[File:Tricklestar Plug Strip.jpg|thumb|A plug strip with 2 USB ports and built in [[Surge protector|surge protection]]]]\n[[Extension cord]]s (extension leads) are used for temporary connections when a socket is not within convenient reach of an appliance's power lead. A [[power strip]] with multiple sockets may also have a switch, surge voltage protection, or over-current protection.\n\n===Special purpose plugs and sockets===\nSpecial purpose sockets may be found in residential, industrial, commercial or institutional buildings. Examples of systems using special purpose sockets include:\n* \"Clean\" (low electrical noise) earth for use with computer systems,\n* [[Emergency power system|Emergency power supply]],\n* [[Uninterruptible power supply]] for critical or life-support equipment,\n* Isolated power for medical instruments, tools used in wet conditions, or electric razors,\n* [[Split-phase electric power#Balanced power|\"Balanced\" or \"technical\"]] power used in audio and video production studios,\n* [[Stage lighting|Theatrical lighting]],\n* [[IEC 60309]] (CEE 17) \"plugs, socket-outlets and couplers for industrial purposes\", used as a weather-resistant connector for [[Caravan (towed trailer)|Caravans]], [[Motorhome]]s, [[camper van]]s and [[tent]]s for mains hook-up at [[camp-site]]s.<ref>[https://www.campingandcaravanningclub.co.uk/helpandadvice/technicalhelp/datasheets/electricity-campers-caravanners/ Using electricity on a campsite] [[Camping and Caravanning Club]]</ref><ref>[https://www.campingandcaravanningclub.co.uk/travelabroad/camping-in-europe/european-campsites/electricity/ Electricity on European Campsites] [[Camping and Caravanning Club]] (UK, so \"European\" means mainland Europe)</ref>\n* Sockets for electric clothes dryers, electric ovens, and air conditioners with higher current rating.\n\nSpecial-purpose sockets may be labelled or coloured to identify a reserved use of a system, or may have keys or specially shaped pins to prevent use of unintended equipment.\n\n==={{anchor|shaver}}Shaver supply units===\n[[File:ShaverSocketUK.jpg|thumb|110px|Shaver supply unit for BS&nbsp;4573, US Type A, Australian two-pin, and Europlug Type C.]]\nNational wiring regulations sometimes prohibit the use of sockets adjacent to water taps, etc.  A special socket, with an [[isolation transformer]], may allow electric razors to be used near a sink. Because the isolation transformer is of low rating, such outlets are not suitable to operate higher-powered appliances such as [[blow dryer]]s.\n\nAn IEC standard 61558-2-5, adopted by [[CENELEC]] and as a national standard in some countries, describes one type of shaver supply unit. Shaver sockets may accept multiple two-pin plug types including Europlug (Type C), Australian (Type I) and [[BS&nbsp;4573]]. The isolation transformer often includes a 115&nbsp;V output accepting two-pin US plugs (Type A). Shaver supply units must also be current limited, IEC&nbsp;61558-2-5 specifies a minimum rating of 20&nbsp;[[Volt-ampere|VA]] and maximum of 50&nbsp;VA.<ref>IEC&nbsp;61558-2-5</ref> Sockets are marked with a shaver symbol, and may also say  \"shavers only\" .\n\nIsolation transformers and dedicated NEMA 1-15 shaver receptacles were once standard installation practice in North America, but now a [[GFCI]] receptacle is used instead. This provides the full capacity of a standard receptacle but protects the user of a razor or other appliance from leakage current.\n\n==Types in present use==\n\nThe plugs and sockets used in a given area are regulated by local governments.\n\nThe [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) maintains a guide with letter designations for generally compatible types of plugs,<ref name=\"World Plugs\">[http://www.iec.ch/worldplugs/ World Plugs] Retrieved on 27 March 2015.</ref> which expands on earlier guides published by the [[United States Department of Commerce]]. This is a ''de facto'' naming standard and guide to travellers. Some letter types correspond to several current ratings or different technical standards, so the letter does not uniquely identify a plug and socket within the type family, nor guarantee compatibility. Physical compatibility of the plug and socket does not ensure correct voltage, frequency, or current capacity. Not all plug and socket families have letters in the IEC guide, but those that have are noted in this article, as are some additional letters commonly used by retail vendors.<ref name=ECO>The letter system first appeared in such guides in 1967 ([http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b4263654 ''Electric Current Abroad''. [[United States Department of Commerce]], 1967]. Retrieved on 14 December 2013.) which designated types A 2-pin US, B (BS 546), and C (BS 1363). The 1984 edition ([http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b4263653 ''Electric Current Abroad''. [[United States Department of Commerce]], 1984]. Retrieved on 14 December 2013.) uses the letters A to G in the same manner as they are used today, and the last revision of the print series was in 1998 ({{cite web | title = Electric Current Abroad | url = http://trade.gov/publications/pdfs/current2002FINAL.pdf | publisher = US Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration (retrieved 9 October 2015)| format = PDF | year = 2002}}).

These two standards are; IRAM 2073 \"Two pole plugs with earthing contact for domestic and similar purposes, rated 10 A and 20 A, 250 V AC\" and IRAM 2071 \"Two pole socket \u2013 outlets with earthing contact for 10 A and 20 A, 250 V AC., for fixed installations.\" The plug and socket system is similar in appearance to the Australian and Chinese plugs. It has an earthing pin and two flat current-carrying pins forming an inverted V-shape (120\u00b0). The flat pins for the 10 A version measure {{convert |6.25|by|1.55|mm|in|3|abbr= on}} and {{convert |8.0|by|1.9|mm|in|3|abbr= on}} for the 20 A version, and are set at 30\u00b0 to the vertical at a nominal pitch of {{convert |7.92|mm|in|3|abbr= on}}. The pin length is the same as in the Chinese version. The earthing pin length is {{convert |21.4|mm|in|3|abbr= on}} for the 10 A version and {{convert |21.8|mm|in|3|abbr= on}} for the 20 A version. On the plugs, the pole length is {{convert |18.2|mm|in|3|abbr= on}} for the 10 A version and {{convert |17.8|mm|in|3|abbr= on}} for the 20 A version. The most important difference from the Australian plug is that the Argentinian plug is wired with the line and neutral contacts reversed.\n\nIn Brazil, similar plugs and sockets are still commonly used for high-power appliances like air conditioners, dishwashers, and household ovens. Although being often called \"Argentinian plug,\" it is actually based on the American NEMA 10-20 standard, and is incompatible{{how|title=[[AS/NZS 3112]] states Argentinian, Australian and [[NEMA 10]] plugs are physically compatible|date=August 2019}} with Argentinian IRAM plugs. Since Brazil adopted the NBR 14136 standard which includes a 20 A version, the original motivation to use the NEMA 10-20 plug has ceased to exist.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n=== Australian/New Zealand standard AS/NZS 3112 (Type I), used in Australasia ===\n{{Details|AS/NZS 3112}}\n[[File:Aust AC plug.jpg|thumb|upright|Standard Australian 10&nbsp;A power plug with insulated pins]]\n[[File:Australian Dual Socket Outlet.jpg|thumb|left|Australasian switched 3-pin (10&nbsp;A) dual socket outlet]]\nThis Australian/New Zealand standard is used in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Tonga, Solomon Islands, and Papua New Guinea. It defines a plug with an earthing pin, and two flat current-carrying pins which form an inverted V-shape.<ref>AS/NZS 3112:2004, ''Approval and test specification&nbsp;\u2013 Plugs and socket-outlets'', [[Standards Australia]] and Standards New Zealand</ref> The flat pins measure {{convert |6.5|by|1.6|mm|in|3|abbr= on}} and are set at 30\u00b0 to the vertical at a nominal pitch of {{convert|13.7|mm|in|3|abbr=on}}. Australian and New Zealand wall sockets almost always have switches on them for extra safety, as in the UK. An unearthed version of this plug with two angled power pins but no earthing pin is used with double-insulated appliances, but the sockets always include an earth contact.\n\nThere are several AS/NZS 3112 plug variants, including ones with larger or differently shaped pins used for devices drawing 15, 20, 25 and 32 [[ampere|A]]. These sockets accept plugs of equal or lower current rating, but not higher. For example, a 10&nbsp;A plug will fit all sockets but a 20&nbsp;A plug will fit only 20, 25 and 32 A sockets. In New Zealand, PDL 940 \"tap-on\" or \"piggy-back\" plugs are available which allow a second 10&nbsp;A plug to be fitted to the rear of the plug. In Australia these piggy-back plugs are now available only on pre-made extension leads.\n\nAustralia's standard plug/socket system was originally codified as standard C112 (floated provisionally in 1937, and adopted as a formal standard in 1938), which was superseded by [[AS 3112|AS&nbsp;3112]] in 1990. The requirement for insulated pins was introduced in the 2004 revision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accesscomms.com.au/reference/insulated-pins.htm |title= Mains Plugs with Insulated Pins.

NBR 14136 does not require shutters on the apertures, a further aspect of non-compliance with IEC 60906-1. NBR 14136 was not enforced in that country until 2007, when its adoption was made optional for manufacturers. It became compulsory on 1 January 2010.\n\nFew private houses in Brazil have an earthed supply, so even if a three-pin socket is present it is not safe to assume that all three terminals are actually connected. Most large domestic appliances were sold with the option to fit a flying earth tail to be locally earthed, but many consumers were unsure how to use this and so didn't connect it. The new standard has an earth pin, which in theory eliminates the need for the flying earth tail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inmetro.gov.br/qualidade/pluguestomadas/perguntas.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 December 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305013445/http://www.inmetro.gov.br/qualidade/pluguestomadas/perguntas.asp |archivedate=5 March 2016  }} 9) Aquele fiozinho que tem pendurado atr\u00e1s da minha geladeira, vai desaparecer?</ref>\n\n{{gallery\n|width=200 |height=150\n|align=center\n|lines=3\n|File:NBR 14136 plugs and outlet.jpg | Brazilian 10 ampere socket and plugs\n|File:Tomada_Brasileira_-_NBR_14136,_20A,_250V.jpg| Brazilian 20 ampere socket}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n===British and compatible standards===\n{{Main|AC power plugs and sockets - British and related types}}\n\n====BS 546 and related types (Type D and M)====\n<!-- \neditors: Additional details should be added to [[AC power plugs and sockets - British and related types]]. \n-->\n[[File:BS 546 Plugs - 15A 5A 2A.png|thumb|BS 546 plugs.

The Europlug is not rewirable and must be supplied with a flexible cord. It can be inserted in either direction, so line and neutral are connected arbitrarily. To improve contact with socket parts the Europlug has slightly flexible pins which converge toward their free ends.\n\nThere is no socket defined to accept only the Europlug. Instead, the Europlug fits a range of sockets in common use in Europe. These sockets, including the CEE&nbsp;7/1, CEE&nbsp;7/3 (German/\"Schuko\"), CEE&nbsp;7/5 (French), and most Israeli, Swiss, Danish and Italian sockets, were designed to accept pins of various diameters, mainly 4.8&nbsp;mm but also 4.0&nbsp;mm and 4.5&nbsp;mm, and are usually fed by final circuits with either 10 A or 16 A overcurrent protection devices.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.legrand.com/files/fck/File/pdf/Guide-International.pdf|title = International electrical standards and regulations|accessdate = 16 November 2015|website = |publisher = Legrand|pages = 14, 22, 30}}</ref>\n\nUK shaver sockets designed to accept BS 4573 shaver plugs also accept Europlugs for applications requiring less than 200&nbsp;mA, but is otherwise not permitted.\n\nThe Europlug is also used in the Middle East, Africa, South America, and Asia.{{Clear}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n===={{anchor|CEE 7/17 plug}}CEE 7/17 unearthed plug====\n[[File:CEE 7-17 plug.jpg|thumb|upright|Hybrid unearthed CEE 7/17 plug]]\nThis is a round plug compatible with CEE&nbsp;7/1, CEE&nbsp;7/3, and CEE&nbsp;7/5 sockets.

It fits into the corresponding computer socket and the normal socket, but normal plugs deliberately don't fit into the special computer socket. The plug is often used in companies, but rarely in private homes.\n\nThere is a variation for hospital equipment with a rectangular left pin, which is used for life support equipment.\n\nTraditionally all Danish sockets were equipped with a switch to prevent touching live pins when connecting/disconnecting the plug. Today, sockets without switch are allowed, but then it is a requirement that the sockets have a cavity to prevent touching the live pins. The shape of the plugs generally makes it difficult to touch the pins when connecting/disconnecting.\n\nSince the early 1990s earthed sockets have been required in all new electric installations in Denmark.

The electricity on the two supplies was separately metered, was sold at different tariffs, was taxed differently and was supplied through separate and different sockets.{{sfn|De Cesco|1975|pp=56\u201357}} Even though the two electric lines (and respective tariffs) were gradually unified beginning in the 1960s (the official, but purely theoretical date was the summer of 1974){{sfn|De Cesco|1975|p=93}} many houses had dual wiring and two electricity meters for years thereafter; in some zones of Lazio the 127&nbsp;V network was provided for lighting until 1999. The two gauges for plugs and sockets thus became a [[de facto standard]] which is now formalized under CEI&nbsp;23-50. Some older installations have sockets that are limited to either the 10&nbsp;A or the 16&nbsp;A style plug, requiring the use of an adaptor if the other gauge needs to be connected. Numerous cross adaptors were used.\n\nAlmost every appliance sold in Italy nowadays is equipped with CEE&nbsp;7/7 (German/French), CEE&nbsp;7/16 or CEE&nbsp;7/17 plugs, but the standard Italian sockets will not accept the first and the third ones since the pins of the CEE&nbsp;7/7 and CEE&nbsp;7/17 plugs are thicker (4.8&nbsp;mm) than the Italian ones (4&nbsp;mm); besides the pins are not sheathed and forcing them into a linear Italian socket may lead to electric shock. Adaptors are standardized in Italy under CEI&nbsp;23-57 which can be used to connect CEE&nbsp;7/7 and CEE&nbsp;7/17 and plugs to linear CEI&nbsp;23-50 sockets.\n\nEuroplugs are also in common use in Italy; they are standardized under CEI&nbsp;23-34 S 1 for use with the 10&nbsp;A socket and can be found fitted to Class II appliances with low current requirement (less than 2.5&nbsp;A).\n\nThe current Italian standards provide for sockets to have child-resistant shutters (\"Sicury\" patent).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vimar.de/de/de/article/article/detail/id/1259 |title=Bestreben Nach Sicherheit &#124; Vimar |publisher=Vimar.de |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Italian multiple standard sockets====\n{{multiple image\n | width=150\n | image1=Adapted schuko.jpg\n | caption1= CEI&nbsp;23-50&nbsp;17/11 (''Bipasso'') socket (#1) and CEI&nbsp;23-50 P&nbsp;40 (Italian adapted ''Schuko'') (#2) in a modern installation.\n | image2=VIMAR_universale.jpg\n | caption2= Italian ''Vimar universale'' socket accepting CEE&nbsp;7/4 (German), CEE&nbsp;7/7 (German/French), CEE&nbsp;7/16 (Europlug), CEE&nbsp;7/17 (German/French unearthed), NEMA&nbsp;1-15 (US/Japan), CEI 23-50&nbsp;S&nbsp;11&nbsp;(10&nbsp;A) and S&nbsp;17&nbsp;(16&nbsp;A) Italian plugs.\n | image3=4box side 4B.AM.H21 28-14.jpg\n | caption3=''4box side'' socket combining 1 Schuko and 2 CEI 23-50&nbsp;P 17/11 ''bipasso'' (Italian type plugs).\n}}\nIn modern installations in Italy (and in other countries where Type L plugs are used) it is usual to find sockets that can accept more than one standard.\n\nThe simplest type, designated CEI&nbsp;23-50 P&nbsp;17/11, has a central round hole flanked by two figure-8 shaped holes, allowing the insertion of CEI&nbsp;23-50 S&nbsp;10 (Italian 10&nbsp;A plug unearthed), CEI&nbsp;23-50 S&nbsp;11 (Italian 10&nbsp;A plug earthed), CEI&nbsp;23-50 S&nbsp;16 (Italian 16&nbsp;A plug unearthed), CEI&nbsp;23-50 S&nbsp;17 (Italian 16&nbsp;A plug earthed) and CEE 7/16 (Europlug).

Physical compatibility does not ensure that the appliance and socket match in frequency or voltage. Adaptors allow travellers to connect devices to foreign sockets, but do not change voltage or frequency. A [[voltage converter]] is required for electrical compatibility in places with a different voltage than the device is designed for. Mismatch in frequency between supply and appliances may still cause problems even at the correct voltage.\n\n===Multisocket adaptors===\nMultisocket adaptors allow the connection of two or more plugs to a single socket. They are manufactured in various configurations, depending on the country and the region in which they are used, with various ratings. In Europe for example, they are called double or triple adaptors, and transform one socket into a multiple socket. This allows connecting more than one electrical consumer item to one single socket and is mainly used for low power devices (TV sets, table lamps, computers, etc.). They are usually rated at 6&nbsp;A 250&nbsp;V, 10&nbsp;A 250&nbsp;V, or 16&nbsp;A 250&nbsp;V, however this is the general rating of the adaptor (for example, if we have an adaptor for four sockets and it is marked 16&nbsp;A 250&nbsp;V, this means that the adaptor should not be loaded more than 16&nbsp;A, whether one, two, three or all sockets are used. Some people overload them, thus leading to accidents). In some countries these adaptors are banned and are not available in shops, as they may lead to fires due to overloading them. Adaptors can be made with ceramic, Bakelite, or other plastic bodies.\n\n==Unusual types==\n{{for|obsolete types|History of AC power plugs and sockets#Obsolete types}}\n\n===Lampholder plug===\n[[File:Lampholder plugs.jpg|thumb|left | Italian bypass lampholder plugs with Edison screw mount. Left: early type (porcelain and brass, c. 1930); right: late type (black plastic, c. 1970)]]\n\nA lampholder plug fits into a light socket in place of a [[light bulb]] to connect appliances to lighting circuits. Where a lower rate was applied to electric power used for lighting circuits, lampholder plugs enabled the consumers to reduce their electricity costs. Lampholder plugs are rarely fused. Edison screw lampholder adaptors (for NEMA 1-15 plugs) are still commonly used in the Americas.\n\n===Soviet adaptor plugs===\n[[File:Soviet power plug.JPG|thumb|left|Soviet adaptor plug]]\nSome appliances sold in the Soviet Union had a flat unearthed plug with an additional pass-through socket on the top, allowing a stacked arrangement of plugs. This design was very useful, because the usual Soviet apartment of the 1960s had very few sockets, but somewhat unsafe; the brass cylinders of the secondary socket were uncovered at the ends (to allow them to be unscrewed easily), recessed by only 3&nbsp;mm, and provided bad contact because they relied on the secondary plug's bisected expanding pins. The pins of the secondary plug (which lacked insulation sleeves) could not be inserted into the cylindrical sockets completely, leaving a 5&nbsp;mm gap between the primary and secondary plugs. The adaptors were mostly used for low power appliances (for example, connecting both a table lamp and a radio to a socket).\n{{clear}}\n\n===UK Walsall Gauge plug===\n[[File:WG13 PICT6943.jpg|thumb|Walsall Gauge 13 A plug (bottom) compared to regular BS 1363 plug]]\n\nUnlike the standard BS&nbsp;1363 plugs found in the UK, the earth pin is on a horizontal axis and the live and neutral pins on a vertical axis. This style of plug/socket was used by university laboratories (from batteries) and the [[BBC]], and is still in use on parts of the [[London Underground]] for 110 V AC voltage supply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plugsocketmuseum.nl/British2.html|title=Non-standard BS 1363 types|work=Museum of Plugs and Sockets|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=3 November 2019}}</ref> In the 1960s they were used for 240 V DC in the Power laboratory of the Electrical Engineering department of what was then University College, Cardiff. Power was supplied by the public 240 V DC mains which remained available in addition to the 240 V AC mains until circa 1969, and thereafter from in-house rectifiers. They were also used in the [[Ministry of Defence Main Building (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence Main Building]] on circuits powered from the standby generators to stop staff from plugging in unauthorised devices. They were also known to be used in some British Rail offices for the same reason.\n\n===Italian BTicino brand Magic security connector===\n{{multiple images\n|align = left\n|image1 = Bticino Magic 1.jpg\n|width1 = 56\n|image2 = Bticino Magic 2.jpg\n|width2 = 100\n|image3 = Bticino Magic 3.jpg\n|width3 = 100\n|footer = Left: Bticino Magic Security socket, detail.<br />Centre: assortment of Magic Security sockets (in orange, the industrial three-phase type).<br />Right: assortment of Magic Security plugs.\n}}\n\nThe Italian manufacturer BTicino in the 1960s introduced an alternative to the Europlug or CEI&nbsp;23-16 connectors then in use.{{sfn|De Cesco|1975|p=73}} The socket is rectangular, with lateral key pins and indentations to maintain polarization, and to prevent insertion of a plug with different current ratings. Three single-phase general purpose connectors were rated 10&nbsp;A, 16&nbsp;A and 20&nbsp;A; and a three-phase industrial connector rated 10&nbsp;A; all of them have different key-pin positioning so plugs and sockets cannot be mismatched.{{sfn|De Cesco|1975|p=75}} The socket is closed by a safety lid (bearing the word \u2018'Magic'\u2019 on it) which can be opened only with an even pressure on its surface, thus preventing the insertion of objects (except the plug itself) inside the socket. The contacts are positioned on both sides of the plug; the plug is energised only when it is inserted fully into the socket.\n\n[[File:Spina magic 02.jpg|thumb|On the left a BTicino Magic Security plug (10&nbsp;A), on the right a type L to Magic Security plug adaptor]]\n\nThe system is not compatible with Italian CEI plugs, nor with Europlugs. Appliances were never sold fitted with these security plugs, and the use of adaptors would defeat the safety features, so the supplied plugs had to be cut off and replaced with the security connector. Even so, the ''Magic'' security system had some success at first because its enhanced safety features appealed to customers; standard connectors of the day were considered not safe enough.{{sfn|De Cesco|1975|p=73}} The decline of the system occurred when safety lids similar to the Magic type were developed<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vimar.eu/index.php?l=it&module=articles&class=articles&event=__default&menu_item_id=134&content=20 |title=La ricerca della sicurezza. Il brevetto Sicury |website=www.vimar.eu. |access-date=12 February 2009}}</ref> for standard sockets.\n\nIn Italy, the system was never definitively abandoned. Though very rarely seen today, it is still marked as available in BTicino\u2019s catalogue,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bticino.assetbank-server.com/bticino/assetfile/50782.pdf |website=bticino.assetbank-server.com |title=Il Classico Dell\u2019Installazione Civile |access-date=20 May 2017}}</ref> (except for the three-phase version, which stopped production in July 2011).\n\nIn Chile, 10&nbsp;A Magic connectors are commonly used for computer/laboratory power networks, as well as for communications or data equipment. This allows delicate electronics equipment to be connected to an independent circuit breaker, usually including a [[surge protector]] or an [[uninterruptible power supply]] backup. The different style of plug makes it more difficult for office workers to connect computer equipment to a standard unprotected power line, or to overload the UPS by connecting other office appliances.\n\nIn Iceland, Magic plugs were widely used in homes and businesses alongside Europlug and Schuko installations. Their installation in new homes was still quite common even in the late 1980s.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Single phase electric stove plugs and sockets==\n[[File:Power connector Legrand 32A.jpg|thumb|left|Plug (sheet V) and socket (sheet VI) to French standard NF&nbsp;C&nbsp;61-315 (400 V, 32 A)]]\n{{multiple image | footer = Russian stove connectors rated 250&nbsp;V 25&nbsp;A AC.

If not hardwired to the supply, electric stoves may be connected to the mains with an appropriate high power connector. Some countries do not have wiring regulations for single-phase electric stoves. In Russia an electric stove can often be seen connected with a 25 to 32&nbsp;A connector.\n\nIn Norway and parts of Sweden a 25 A grounded connector, rectangular shaped with rounded corners, is used for single phase stoves. The connector has three rectangular pins in a row, with the grounding pin longer than other two. The corresponding socket is recessed to prevent shocks. The Norwegian standard is NEK&nbsp;502:2005 \u2013 standard sheet X (socket) and sheet XI (plug). They are also known as the two pole and earth variants of CEE&nbsp;7/10 (socket) and CEE&nbsp;7/11 (plug).\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n{{div col|colwidth=23em}}\n* [[DC connector]]\n* [[IEC 60309]] high-power industrial and polyphase connectors\n* [[IEC 60320]] appliance connectors\n* [[Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets]]\n* [[Mains electricity]]\n* [[Mains electricity by country]] lists voltage, frequency, and connector types for over 200 countries\n* [[Plug load]]\n* [[Polyphase system]]\n* [[Stage pin connector]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Mains connectors}}\n{{Wikibooks|Guide to electrical equipment for travellers}}\n* [http://www.plugsocketmuseum.nl/ Digital Museum of Plugs and Sockets] (comprehensive collection of plugs and sockets)\n* [http://www.electropedia.org Glossary of standards terms]\n* [https://www.gewinde-normen.de/en/e-thread.html Edison thread]\n\n{{Electronic components}}\n\n[[Category:Electrical standards]]\n[[Category:Electrical wiring]]\n[[Category:Mains power connectors]]\n", "name_user": "128.76.194.53", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power_plugs_and_sockets"}

He is known for his starring role as Malik El Djebena in the 2009 award-winning [[Cinema of France|French]] movie ''[[A Prophet]]'' by [[Jacques Audiard]], FBI Agent [[Ali Soufan]] in ''[[The Looming Tower (miniseries)|The Looming Tower]]'', and for playing [[Judas]] in the film ''[[Mary Magdalene (2018 film)|Mary Magdalene]]'', written by [[Helen Edmundson]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/life/03/28/18/movie-review-mary-magdalene-seeks-to-redefine-distaff-disciple|title=Movie review: 'Mary Magdalene' seeks to redefine distaff disciple|first=Fred|last=Hawson|website=ABS-CBN News}}</ref> \n\nRahim has demonstrated multilingual skills and an ear for accents,  having acted in [[Corsican language|Corsican]] and [[Arabic]] in addition to French in ''[[A Prophet]]'', and in Scottish [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] for his role as the Seal Prince in [[Kevin Macdonald (director)|Kevin Macdonald]]'s ''[[The Eagle (2011 film)|The Eagle]]''. \n\n==Early life==\nRahim was born in [[Belfort]], France, into a family that had immigrated from the region of [[Oran]], [[Algeria]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpressiondz.com/article/3/2009-05-19/63883.html |title=L'Expression - Le Quotidien - 110 km d\u2019autoroute achev\u00e9s |publisher=Lexpressiondz.com |date=2009-05-19 |accessdate=2011-09-07}}</ref>\n\nAfter earning a [[Baccalaur\u00e9at]] at the [[Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet (Belfort)|Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet]] of Belfort, he enrolled first in Sports and then Computer Science programs. After two subsequent years of an unmotivated boredom with the subjects in Strasbourg and Marseille, Rahim decided to pursue his passion and began to study film at the [[Paul Val\u00e9ry University, Montpellier III|Paul Val\u00e9ry University]] of [[Montpellier]]. His life as a film student was chronicled in a documentary by fellow ''Belfortain'' [[Cyril Mennegun]] titled \"Tahar, student\", aired on French TV channel [[France 5]] in 2006. \n\nFollowing this, Rahim moved to Paris in 2005 and studied drama at the ''Laboratoire de l'Acteur'' under H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Zidi-Ch\u00e9ruy while working in a factory during the week, and in a night club on weekends to make ends meet.\n\n==Career==\n\nIn mid-2006, after signing with an agent, Rahim won a part in the hit [[Canal+]] television series ''La Commune'' written by Abdel Raouf Dafri. Dafri penned the first draft of the script to ''A Prophet''. Rahim then met Audiard when the two coincidentally shared a cab while leaving a set. Tahar introduced himself saying that \"I knew it was Audiard and I said I was a fan but I think I was a bit silly\" and was afterward very surprised that Audiard remembered him enough to contact him about ''A Prophet''. After a two-line appearance in 2008 horror movie ''[[Inside (2007 film)|Inside]]'' starring [[B\u00e9atrice Dalle]], he went through a gruelling three months of auditioning.

After two subsequent years of an unmotivated boredom with the subjects in Strasbourg and Marseille, Rahim decided to pursue his passion and began to study film at the [[Paul Val\u00e9ry University, Montpellier III|Paul Val\u00e9ry University]] of [[Montpellier]]. His life as a film student was chronicled in a documentary by fellow ''Belfortain'' [[Cyril Mennegun]] titled \"Tahar, student\", aired on French TV channel [[France 5]] in 2006. \n\nFollowing this, Rahim moved to Paris in 2005 and studied drama at the ''Laboratoire de l'Acteur'' under H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Zidi-Ch\u00e9ruy while working in a factory during the week, and in a night club on weekends to make ends meet.\n\n==Career==\n\nIn mid-2006, after signing with an agent, Rahim won a part in the hit [[Canal+]] television series ''La Commune'' written by Abdel Raouf Dafri. Dafri penned the first draft of the script to ''A Prophet''. Rahim then met Audiard when the two coincidentally shared a cab while leaving a set. Tahar introduced himself saying that \"I knew it was Audiard and I said I was a fan but I think I was a bit silly\" and was afterward very surprised that Audiard remembered him enough to contact him about ''A Prophet''. After a two-line appearance in 2008 horror movie ''[[Inside (2007 film)|Inside]]'' starring [[B\u00e9atrice Dalle]], he went through a gruelling three months of auditioning. After eight callbacks, he landed his breakthrough role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/culture/cinema/tahar-rahim-je-m-etais-donne-dix-ans-pour-y-arriver_852587.html |title=Tahar Rahim: \"Je m'\u00e9tais donn\u00e9 dix ans pour y arriver\" - L'EXPRESS |publisher=Lexpress.fr |date= |accessdate=2011-09-07}}</ref><ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article6988127.ece?print=yes&randnum=1151003209000] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615060510/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article6988127.ece?print=yes&randnum=1151003209000 |date=2011-06-15 }}</ref>\n\nRahim also starred in controversial Chinese director [[Lou Ye]]'s film ''[[Love and Bruises]]''.
