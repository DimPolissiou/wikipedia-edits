After the success of Williams around the world, especially in Europe, Williams was signed to [[Capitol Records]] in the United States, which was a part of [[EMI]] at the time. The album was released in May 1999 in the United States and Canada, and later issued worldwide. All tracks were previously released on Williams' first two albums, ''[[Life thru a Lens]]'' (1997) and ''[[I've Been Expecting You]]'' (1998).\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nWilliams embarked on a US Promotional Tour and when his first American single, \"[[Millennium (single)|Millennium]]\" was released, it peaked at No. 72 in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The album ''The Ego Has Landed'' was released in May 1999 in the United States and peaked at No. 63 in the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' albums chart]], not having the success that he enjoyed in Europe. Despite this, Williams enjoyed good video airplay and received a nomination for the [[MTV Video Music Awards]] for \"Best Male Video\"; he did not win, but the exposure helped the sales of the album. \n\nCapitol Records, trying to make Williams a bigger star, released a second single from the album, the ballad \"[[Angels (Robbie Williams song)|Angels]]\", for which Williams shot a new video. When it was released in the autumn of that year, the song became a somewhat bigger hit than \"Millennium\", charting at No. 53. However, this was not enough for Williams, so he concentrated on the rest of the world where he was already an established act. The album went on to sell 598,000 copies in the United States<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003286968 |title=Ask Billboard: Rude Americans |last=Caufield |first=Keith |date=23 October 2006 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=11 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234520/http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003286968 |archivedate=26 September 2007 }}</ref> being certified Gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in November of that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?artist=%22The+Ego+Has+Landed%22 |title=RIAA's Gold & Platinum Searchable Database: Williams, Robbie - 'The Ego Has Landed' |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] |accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe compilation was released worldwide (as a limited edition in Europe, pressings for the album are still going strong in Latin America, Asia and New Zealand to this day) and was a huge success in New Zealand, reaching No. 1 on the Official Albums Chart.<ref>[https://charts.nz/showitem.asp?key=7331&cat=a New Zealand Albums Chart]</ref> It went on to sell 140,000 copies being certified 9\u00d7 Platinum. In Australia, the album ensured platinum sales over 70,000 copies. The album was promoted in Latin America as well. Williams recorded a Spanish version of his hit \"Angels\" and it was included as a bonus track on the album and then released as a single (almost two years after its original release in English). The Spanish version was a substantial hit in most Latin American countries, but as the single had already been big in 1997, most video and radio outlets focused on the tracks from his album ''I've Been Expecting You''. Despite this, the compilation proved to be a medium success giving him Gold sales in Mexico and Argentina. It has sold over one million copies worldwide.\n\n== Track listing ==\n*All production by [[Guy Chambers]] and [[Steve Power]].\n\n{{Track listing\n| title1          = [[Lazy Days]]\n| writer1         = {{flat list|\n* [[Robbie Williams]]\n* Guy Chambers\n}}\n| length1         = 3:52\n\n| title2          = [[Millennium (song)|Millennium]]\n| writer2         = {{flat list|\n* Williams\n* Chambers\n* [[Leslie Bricusse]]\n* [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]]\n}}\n| length2         = 4:04\n\n| title3          = [[No Regrets (Robbie Williams song)|No Regrets]]\n| writer3         = {{flat list|\n* Williams\n* Chambers\n}}\n| length3         = 5:09\n\n| title4          = [[Strong (Robbie Williams song)|Strong]]\n| writer4         = {{flat list|\n* Williams\n* Chambers\n}}\n| length4         = 4:37\n\n| title5          = [[Angels (Robbie Williams song)|Angels]]\n| writer5         = {{flat list|\n* Williams\n* Chambers\n}}\n| length5         = 4:24\n\n| title6          = [[Win Some Lose Some]]\n| writer6         = {{flat list|\n* Williams\n* Chambers\n}}\n| length6         = 4:18\n\n| title7          = [[Let Me Entertain You (Robbie Williams song)|Let Me Entertain You]]\n| writer7         = {{flat list|\n* Williams\n* Chambers\n}}\n| length7         = 4:18\n\n| title8          = Jesus in a Camper Van\n| writer8         = {{flat list|\n* Williams\n* Chambers\n* [[Loudon Wainwright III]]\n}}\n| length8         = 3:38\n\n| title9          = [[Old Before I Die]]\n| writer9         = {{flat list|\n* Williams\n* [[Eric Bazilian]]\n* [[Desmond Child]]\n}}\n| length9         = 3:53\n\n| title10          = Killing Me\n| writer10         = {{flat list|\n* Williams\n* Chambers\n}}\n| length10         = 3:57\n\n| title11          = Man Machine\n| writer11         = {{flat list|\n* Williams\n* Chambers\n}}\n| length11         = 3:35\n\n| title12          = [[She's the One (World Party song)|She's the One]]\n| writer12         = [[Karl Wallinger]]\n| length12         = 4:18\n\n| title13          = Karma Killer\n| writer13         = {{Flat list|\n* Williams\n* Chambers\n}}\n| length13         = 4:28\n\n| title14          = One of God's Better People\n| writer14         = {{Flat list|\n* Williams\n* Chambers\n}}\n| length14         = 15:03\n| total_length     = 69:50\n}}\n\nTracks 1, 5, 7, 9, 10, and 14 are from ''[[Life thru a Lens]]'' (1997).<br> \nTracks 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 12, and 13 are from ''[[I've Been Expecting You]]'' (1998).<br>\n\n\"One of God's Better People\" runs 3:36.

After the success of Williams around the world, especially in Europe, Williams was signed to [[Capitol Records]] in the United States, which was a part of [[EMI]] at the time. The album was released in May 1999 in the United States and Canada, and later issued worldwide. All tracks were previously released on Williams' first two albums, ''[[Life thru a Lens]]'' (1997) and ''[[I've Been Expecting You]]'' (1998).\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nWilliams embarked on a US Promotional Tour and when his first American single, \"[[Millennium (single)|Millennium]]\" was released, it peaked at No. 72 in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The album ''The Ego Has Landed'' was released in May 1999 in the United States and peaked at No. 63 in the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' albums chart]], not having the success that he enjoyed in Europe. Despite this, Williams enjoyed good video airplay and received a nomination for the [[MTV Video Music Awards]] for \"Best Male Video\"; he did not win, but the exposure helped the sales of the album. \n\nCapitol Records, trying to make Williams a bigger star, released a second single from the album, the ballad \"[[Angels (Robbie Williams song)|Angels]]\", for which Williams shot a new video. When it was released in the autumn of that year, the song became a somewhat bigger hit than \"Millennium\", charting at No. 53. However, this was not enough for Williams, so he concentrated on the rest of the world where he was already an established act. The album went on to sell 598,000 copies in the United States<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003286968 |title=Ask Billboard: Rude Americans |last=Caufield |first=Keith |date=23 October 2006 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=11 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234520/http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003286968 |archivedate=26 September 2007 }}</ref> being certified Gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in November of that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?artist=%22The+Ego+Has+Landed%22 |title=RIAA's Gold & Platinum Searchable Database: Williams, Robbie - 'The Ego Has Landed' |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] |accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe compilation was released worldwide (as a limited edition in Europe, pressings for the album are still going strong in Latin America, Asia and New Zealand to this day) and was a huge success in New Zealand, reaching No. 1 on the Official Albums Chart.<ref>[https://charts.nz/showitem.asp?key=7331&cat=a New Zealand Albums Chart]</ref> It went on to sell 140,000 copies being certified 9\u00d7 Platinum. In Australia, the album ensured platinum sales over 70,000 copies. The album was promoted in Latin America as well. Williams recorded a Spanish version of his hit \"Angels\" and it was included as a bonus track on the album and then released as a single (almost two years after its original release in English). The Spanish version was a substantial hit in most Latin American countries, but as the single had already been big in 1997, most video and radio outlets focused on the tracks from his album ''I've Been Expecting You''. Despite this, the compilation proved to be a medium success giving him Gold sales in Mexico and Argentina. It has sold over one million copies worldwide.\n\n== Track listing ==\n*All production by [[Guy Chambers]] and [[Steve Power]].\n\n{{Track listing\n| title1          = [[Lazy Days]]\n| writer1         = {{flat list|\n* [[Robbie Williams]]\n* Guy Chambers\n}}\n| length1         = 3:52\n\n| title2          = [[Millennium (song)|Millennium]]\n| writer2         = {{flat list|\n* Williams\n* Chambers\n* [[Leslie Bricusse]]\n* [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]]\n}}\n| length2         = 4:04\n\n| title3          = [[No Regrets (Robbie Williams song)|No Regrets]]\n| writer3         = {{flat list|\n* Williams\n* Chambers\n}}\n| length3         = 5:09\n\n| title4          = [[Strong (Robbie Williams song)|Strong]]\n| writer4         = {{flat list|\n* Williams\n* Chambers\n}}\n| length4         = 4:37\n\n| title5          = [[Angels (Robbie Williams song)|Angels]]\n| writer5         = {{flat list|\n* Williams\n* Chambers\n}}\n| length5         = 4:24\n\n| title6          = [[Win Some Lose Some]]\n| writer6         = {{flat list|\n* Williams\n* Chambers\n}}\n| length6         = 4:18\n\n| title7          = [[Let Me Entertain You (Robbie Williams song)|Let Me Entertain You]]\n| writer7         = {{flat list|\n* Williams\n* Chambers\n}}\n| length7         = 4:18\n\n| title8          = Jesus in a Camper Van\n| writer8         = {{flat list|\n* Williams\n* Chambers\n* [[Loudon Wainwright III]]\n}}\n| length8         = 3:38\n\n| title9          = [[Old Before I Die]]\n| writer9         = {{flat list|\n* Williams\n* [[Eric Bazilian]]\n* [[Desmond Child]]\n}}\n| length9         = 3:53\n\n| title10          = Killing Me\n| writer10         = {{flat list|\n* Williams\n* Chambers\n}}\n| length10         = 3:57\n\n| title11          = Man Machine\n| writer11         = {{flat list|\n* Williams\n* Chambers\n}}\n| length11         = 3:35\n\n| title12          = [[She's the One (World Party song)|She's the One]]\n| writer12         = [[Karl Wallinger]]\n| length12         = 4:18\n\n| title13          = Karma Killer\n| writer13         = {{Flat list|\n* Williams\n* Chambers\n}}\n| length13         = 4:28\n\n| title14          = One of God's Better People\n| writer14         = {{Flat list|\n* Williams\n* Chambers\n}}\n| length14         = 15:03\n| total_length     = 69:50\n}}\n\nTracks 1, 5, 7, 9, 10, and 14 are from ''[[Life thru a Lens]]'' (1997).<br> \nTracks 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 12, and 13 are from ''[[I've Been Expecting You]]'' (1998).<br>\n\n\"One of God's Better People\" runs 3:36.

It is anticipated that remotely guided ultrasound scans will have application on Earth in emergency and rural care situations where access to a trained physician is difficult.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/ADUM.html |date=1 May 2009 |accessdate=1 October 2009 |author=Brooke Boen |publisher=NASA |title=Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity (ADUM) |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029061057/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/ADUM.html |archivedate=29 October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=A Pilot Study of Comprehensive Ultrasound Education at the Wayne State University School of Medicine |journal=Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine |first1=Sishir |last1=Rao |first2=Lodewijk |last2=van Holsbeeck |first3=Joseph L. |last3=Musial |first4=Alton |last4=Parker |first5=J.

To keep the internal temperature within workable limits, a passive thermal control system (PTCS) is made of external surface materials, insulation such as MLI, and heat pipes. If the PTCS cannot keep up with the heat load, an External Active Thermal Control System (EATCS) maintains the temperature. The EATCS consists of an internal, non-toxic, water coolant loop used to cool and dehumidify the atmosphere, which transfers collected heat into an external liquid [[ammonia]] loop. From the heat exchangers, ammonia is pumped into external radiators that emit heat as infrared radiation, then back to the station.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast21mar_1/ |title=Staying Cool on the ISS |publisher=NASA |first1=Steve |last1=Price |first2=Tony |last2=Phillips |first3=Gil |last3=Knier |date=21 March 2001 |accessdate=22 July 2016}}</ref> The EATCS provides cooling for all the US pressurised modules, including ''Kib\u014d'' and ''Columbus'', as well as the main power distribution electronics of the S0, S1 and P1 trusses.

Examples of ORUs are pumps, storage tanks, controller boxes, antennas, and battery units. Some units can be replaced using robotic arms. Most are stored outside the station, either on small pallets called [[ExPRESS Logistics Carrier]]s (ELCs) or share larger platforms called [[External Stowage Platform]]s which also hold science experiments. Both kinds of pallets provide electricity for many parts that could be damaged by the cold of space and require heating. The larger logistics carriers also have local area network (LAN) connections for telemetry to connect experiments. A heavy emphasis on stocking the USOS with ORU's occurred around 2011, before the end of the NASA shuttle programme, as its commercial replacements, [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] and [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon]], carry one tenth to one quarter the payload.\n\nUnexpected problems and failures have impacted the station's assembly time-line and work schedules leading to periods of reduced capabilities and, in some cases, could have forced abandonment of the station for safety reasons. Serious problems include an air leak from the USOS in 2004,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3882962 |title=Crew finds 'culprit' in space station leak |publisher=NBC News |date=11 January 2004 |first=James |last=Oberg |accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref> the venting of fumes from an ''[[Elektron (ISS)|Elektron]]'' oxygen generator in 2006,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/station/exp13/060918elektron.html |title=Oxygen Generator Problem Triggers Station Alarm |work=CBS News via Spaceflight Now |date=18 September 2006 |first=William |last=Harwood |accessdate=24 November 2008}}</ref> and the failure of the computers in the ROS in 2007 during [[STS-117]] that left the station without thruster, ''Elektron'', ''[[Vozdukh]]'' and other environmental control system operations.

The same valve was then used to vent the ammonia from the damaged panel, eliminating the possibility of an ammonia leak.<ref name=\"Radiator\" /> It is also known that a Service Module thruster cover struck the S1 radiator after being jettisoned during an EVA in 2008, but its effect, if any, has not been determined.\n\nEarly on 1 August 2010, a failure in cooling Loop A (starboard side), one of two external cooling loops, left the station with only half of its normal cooling capacity and zero redundancy in some systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1007/31station/ |title=Problem forces partial powerdown aboard station |publisher=Spaceflightnow.com |date=31 July 2010 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=34622 |title=NASA ISS On-Orbit Status 1 August 2010 (early edition) |publisher=Spaceref.com |date=31 July 2010 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/spacestation/systems/atcs.html |title=ISS Active Control System |publisher=Boeing |date=21 November 2006 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref> The problem appeared to be in the ammonia pump module that circulates the ammonia cooling fluid.

From an average distance of about {{convert|70,000|km|abbr=on}}, depending on Solar activity, the [[magnetosphere]] begins to deflect [[solar wind]] around Earth and ISS. [[coronal mass ejection|Solar flares]] are still a hazard to the crew, who may receive only a few minutes warning. In 2005, during the initial 'proton storm' of an X-3 class solar flare, the crew of [[Expedition 10]] took shelter in a more heavily shielded part of the [[Russian Orbital Segment|ROS]] designed for this purpose.<ref>{{cite web |title=Solar Flare Hits Earth and Mars |author=Ker Than |publisher=Space.com |date=23 February 2006 |url=http://www.space.com/2080-solar-flare-hits-earth-mars.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=A new kind of solar storm |publisher=NASA |date=10 June 2005 |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2005/10jun_newstorm/}}</ref>\n\nSubatomic charged particles, primarily [[proton]]s from [[cosmic ray]]s and solar wind, are normally absorbed by Earth's atmosphere. When they interact in sufficient quantity, their effect is visible to the naked eye in a phenomenon called an [[aurora]]. Outside Earth's atmosphere, crews are exposed to about 1 [[millisievert]] each day, which is about a year of natural exposure on Earth, resulting in a higher risk of cancer. Radiation can penetrate living tissue and damage the [[DNA]] and [[chromosome]]s of [[lymphocytes]]. These cells are central to the [[immune system]], and so any damage to them could contribute to the lower [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] experienced by astronauts. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of [[cataract]]s in astronauts. Protective shielding and drugs may lower risks to an acceptable level.<ref name=\"JCB\"/>\n\nRadiation levels on the ISS are about five times greater than those experienced by airline passengers and crew, as Earth's electromagnetic field provides almost the same level of protection against solar and other radiation in low Earth orbit as in the stratosphere. For example, on a 12-hour flight an airline passenger would experience 0.1 millisieverts of radiation, or a rate of 0.2 millisieverts per day; only 1/5 the rate experienced by an astronaut in LEO. Additionally, airline passengers experience this level of radiation for a few hours of flight, while ISS crew are exposed for their whole stay.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jag.cami.jccbi.gov./cariprofile.asp |title=Galactic Radiation Received in Flight |accessdate=20 May 2010 |publisher=FAA Civil Aeromedical Institute |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329130826/http://jag.cami.jccbi.gov/cariprofile.asp |archivedate=29 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Stress===\n[[File:Nikolai Budarin in a sleep station in Zvezda.jpg|thumb|Cosmonaut [[Nikolai Budarin]] at work inside ''[[Zvezda (ISS module)|Zvezda]]'' service module crew quarters]]\nThere is considerable evidence that [[psychosocial]] stressors are among the most important impediments to optimal crew morale and performance.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Peter Suedfeld1 |author2=Kasia E.

The latter is still often a cause of stress on the ISS, such as when the mother of NASA Astronaut [[Daniel M. Tani|Daniel Tani]] died in a car accident, and when Michael Fincke was forced to miss the birth of his second child.\n\nA study of the longest spaceflight concluded that the first three weeks are a critical period where attention is adversely affected because of the demand to adjust to the extreme change of environment.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Manzey |first1=D. |last2=Lorenz |first2=B. |last3=Poljakov |first3=V. |doi=10.1080/001401398186991 |title=Mental performance in extreme environments: Results from a performance monitoring study during a 438-day spaceflight |journal=Ergonomics |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=537\u2013559 |year=1998 |pmid=9557591 |pmc=}}</ref> ISS crew flights typically last about five to six months.\n\nThe ISS working environment includes further stress caused by living and working in cramped conditions with people from very different cultures who speak a different language.

Specifically, these goals have been the primary focus of the ISS Multilateral Medical Operations Panel (MMOP) Acoustics Subgroup since the first days of ISS assembly and operations.[https://web.archive.org/web/20200220193031/http://emits.sso.esa.int/emits-doc/ESTEC/AO6216-SoW-RD9.pdf]  [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039608.pdf] The effort includes contributions from [[Acoustical engineering|acoustical engineers]], [[Audiology|audiologists]], [[Industrial Hygienists|industrial hygienists]], and physicians who comprise the subgroup's membership from NASA, the [[Roscosmos|Russian Space Agency]] (RSA), the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), the [[JAXA|Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA), and the [[Canadian Space Agency]] (CSA).\n\nWhen compared to terrestrial environments, the noise levels incurred by astronauts and cosmonauts on the ISS may seem insignificant and typically occur at levels that would not be of major concern to [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|the Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] \u2013 rarely reaching 85 dBA.  But crew members are exposed to these levels 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with current missions averaging 6 months in duration.  These levels of noise also impose risks to crew health and performance in the form of sleep interference and communication, as well as reduced alarm [[Hearing|audibility]].\n\nOver the 19 plus year history of the ISS, significant efforts have been put forth to limit and reduce noise levels on the ISS.  During design and pre-flight activities, members of the Acoustic Subgroup have written acoustic limits and verification requirements, consulted to design and choose quietest available payloads, and then conducted acoustic verification tests prior to launch.[https://web.archive.org/web/20200220193031/http://emits.sso.esa.int/emits-doc/ESTEC/AO6216-SoW-RD9.pdf]  During spaceflights, the Acoustics Subgroup has assessed each ISS module's in flight sound levels, produced by a large number of vehicle and science experiment noise sources, to assure compliance with strict acoustic standards.   The acoustic environment on ISS changed when additional modules were added during its construction, and as additional spacecraft arrive at the ISS.  The Acoustics Subgroup has responded to this dynamic operations schedule by successfully designing and employing acoustic covers, absorptive materials, [[Noise barrier|noise barriers]], and vibration isolators to reduce noise levels. Moreover, when pumps, fans, and ventilation systems age and show increased noise levels,  this Acoustics Subgroup has guided ISS managers to replace the older, noisier instruments with quiet fan and pump technologies, significantly reducing [[Ambient noise level|ambient noise levels]].\n\nNASA has adopted most-conservative damage risk criteria (based on recommendations from the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] and the [[World Health Organization]]), in order to protect all crew members.  The MMOP Acoustics Subgroup has adjusted its approach to managing noise risks in this unique environment by applying, or modifying, terrestrial approaches for hearing loss prevention to set these conservative limits.  One innovative approach has been NASA's Noise Exposure Estimation Tool (NEET), in which noise exposures are calculated in a task-based approach to determine the need for [[Hearing protection device|hearing protection devices]] (HPDs).  Guidance for use of HPDs, either mandatory use or recommended, is then documented in the Noise Hazard Inventory, and posted for crew reference during their missions. The Acoustics Subgroup also tracks spacecraft noise exceedances, applies [[engineering controls]], and recommends hearing protective devices to reduce crew noise exposures. Finally, hearing thresholds are monitored on-orbit, during missions . \n\nThere have been no persistent mission-related hearing threshold shifts among US Orbital Segment crewmembers (JAXA, CSA, ESA, NASA) during what is approaching 20 years of ISS mission operations, or nearly 175,000 work hours. In 2020, the MMOP Acoustics Subgroup received the [[Safe-In-Sound Award]] for Innovation for their combined efforts to mitigate any health effects of noise.[https://www.safeinsound.us/winners.html]\n\n===Fire and toxic gases===\nAn onboard fire or a toxic gas leak are other potential hazards.

To keep the internal temperature within workable limits, a passive thermal control system (PTCS) is made of external surface materials, insulation such as MLI, and heat pipes. If the PTCS cannot keep up with the heat load, an External Active Thermal Control System (EATCS) maintains the temperature. The EATCS consists of an internal, non-toxic, water coolant loop used to cool and dehumidify the atmosphere, which transfers collected heat into an external liquid [[ammonia]] loop. From the heat exchangers, ammonia is pumped into external radiators that emit heat as infrared radiation, then back to the station.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast21mar_1/ |title=Staying Cool on the ISS |publisher=NASA |first1=Steve |last1=Price |first2=Tony |last2=Phillips |first3=Gil |last3=Knier |date=21 March 2001 |accessdate=22 July 2016}}</ref> The EATCS provides cooling for all the US pressurised modules, including ''Kib\u014d'' and ''Columbus'', as well as the main power distribution electronics of the S0, S1 and P1 trusses.

Examples of ORUs are pumps, storage tanks, controller boxes, antennas, and battery units. Some units can be replaced using robotic arms. Most are stored outside the station, either on small pallets called [[ExPRESS Logistics Carrier]]s (ELCs) or share larger platforms called [[External Stowage Platform]]s which also hold science experiments. Both kinds of pallets provide electricity for many parts that could be damaged by the cold of space and require heating. The larger logistics carriers also have local area network (LAN) connections for telemetry to connect experiments. A heavy emphasis on stocking the USOS with ORU's occurred around 2011, before the end of the NASA shuttle programme, as its commercial replacements, [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] and [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon]], carry one tenth to one quarter the payload.\n\nUnexpected problems and failures have impacted the station's assembly time-line and work schedules leading to periods of reduced capabilities and, in some cases, could have forced abandonment of the station for safety reasons. Serious problems include an air leak from the USOS in 2004,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3882962 |title=Crew finds 'culprit' in space station leak |publisher=NBC News |date=11 January 2004 |first=James |last=Oberg |accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref> the venting of fumes from an ''[[Elektron (ISS)|Elektron]]'' oxygen generator in 2006,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/station/exp13/060918elektron.html |title=Oxygen Generator Problem Triggers Station Alarm |work=CBS News via Spaceflight Now |date=18 September 2006 |first=William |last=Harwood |accessdate=24 November 2008}}</ref> and the failure of the computers in the ROS in 2007 during [[STS-117]] that left the station without thruster, ''Elektron'', ''[[Vozdukh]]'' and other environmental control system operations.

The same valve was then used to vent the ammonia from the damaged panel, eliminating the possibility of an ammonia leak.<ref name=\"Radiator\" /> It is also known that a Service Module thruster cover struck the S1 radiator after being jettisoned during an EVA in 2008, but its effect, if any, has not been determined.\n\nEarly on 1 August 2010, a failure in cooling Loop A (starboard side), one of two external cooling loops, left the station with only half of its normal cooling capacity and zero redundancy in some systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1007/31station/ |title=Problem forces partial powerdown aboard station |publisher=Spaceflightnow.com |date=31 July 2010 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=34622 |title=NASA ISS On-Orbit Status 1 August 2010 (early edition) |publisher=Spaceref.com |date=31 July 2010 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/spacestation/systems/atcs.html |title=ISS Active Control System |publisher=Boeing |date=21 November 2006 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref> The problem appeared to be in the ammonia pump module that circulates the ammonia cooling fluid.

From an average distance of about {{convert|70,000|km|abbr=on}}, depending on Solar activity, the [[magnetosphere]] begins to deflect [[solar wind]] around Earth and ISS. [[coronal mass ejection|Solar flares]] are still a hazard to the crew, who may receive only a few minutes warning. In 2005, during the initial 'proton storm' of an X-3 class solar flare, the crew of [[Expedition 10]] took shelter in a more heavily shielded part of the [[Russian Orbital Segment|ROS]] designed for this purpose.<ref>{{cite web |title=Solar Flare Hits Earth and Mars |author=Ker Than |publisher=Space.com |date=23 February 2006 |url=http://www.space.com/2080-solar-flare-hits-earth-mars.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=A new kind of solar storm |publisher=NASA |date=10 June 2005 |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2005/10jun_newstorm/}}</ref>\n\nSubatomic charged particles, primarily [[proton]]s from [[cosmic ray]]s and solar wind, are normally absorbed by Earth's atmosphere. When they interact in sufficient quantity, their effect is visible to the naked eye in a phenomenon called an [[aurora]]. Outside Earth's atmosphere, crews are exposed to about 1 [[millisievert]] each day, which is about a year of natural exposure on Earth, resulting in a higher risk of cancer. Radiation can penetrate living tissue and damage the [[DNA]] and [[chromosome]]s of [[lymphocytes]]. These cells are central to the [[immune system]], and so any damage to them could contribute to the lower [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] experienced by astronauts. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of [[cataract]]s in astronauts. Protective shielding and drugs may lower risks to an acceptable level.<ref name=\"JCB\"/>\n\nRadiation levels on the ISS are about five times greater than those experienced by airline passengers and crew, as Earth's electromagnetic field provides almost the same level of protection against solar and other radiation in low Earth orbit as in the stratosphere. For example, on a 12-hour flight an airline passenger would experience 0.1 millisieverts of radiation, or a rate of 0.2 millisieverts per day; only 1/5 the rate experienced by an astronaut in LEO. Additionally, airline passengers experience this level of radiation for a few hours of flight, while ISS crew are exposed for their whole stay.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jag.cami.jccbi.gov./cariprofile.asp |title=Galactic Radiation Received in Flight |accessdate=20 May 2010 |publisher=FAA Civil Aeromedical Institute |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329130826/http://jag.cami.jccbi.gov/cariprofile.asp |archivedate=29 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Stress===\n[[File:Nikolai Budarin in a sleep station in Zvezda.jpg|thumb|Cosmonaut [[Nikolai Budarin]] at work inside ''[[Zvezda (ISS module)|Zvezda]]'' service module crew quarters]]\nThere is considerable evidence that [[psychosocial]] stressors are among the most important impediments to optimal crew morale and performance.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Peter Suedfeld1 |author2=Kasia E.

The latter is still often a cause of stress on the ISS, such as when the mother of NASA Astronaut [[Daniel M.

Specifically, these goals have been the primary focus of the ISS Multilateral Medical Operations Panel (MMOP) Acoustics Subgroup since the first days of ISS assembly and operations.[https://web.archive.org/web/20200220193031/http://emits.sso.esa.int/emits-doc/ESTEC/AO6216-SoW-RD9.pdf]  [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039608.pdf] The effort includes contributions from [[Acoustical engineering|acoustical engineers]], [[Audiology|audiologists]], [[Industrial Hygienists|industrial hygienists]], and physicians who comprise the subgroup's membership from NASA, the [[Roscosmos|Russian Space Agency]] (RSA), the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), the [[JAXA|Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA), and the [[Canadian Space Agency]] (CSA).\n\nWhen compared to terrestrial environments, the noise levels incurred by astronauts and cosmonauts on the ISS may seem insignificant and typically occur at levels that would not be of major concern to [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|the Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] \u2013 rarely reaching 85 dBA.  But crew members are exposed to these levels 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with current missions averaging 6 months in duration.  These levels of noise also impose risks to crew health and performance in the form of sleep interference and communication, as well as reduced alarm [[Hearing|audibility]].\n\nOver the 19 plus year history of the ISS, significant efforts have been put forth to limit and reduce noise levels on the ISS.  During design and pre-flight activities, members of the Acoustic Subgroup have written acoustic limits and verification requirements, consulted to design and choose quietest available payloads, and then conducted acoustic verification tests prior to launch.[https://web.archive.org/web/20200220193031/http://emits.sso.esa.int/emits-doc/ESTEC/AO6216-SoW-RD9.pdf]  During spaceflights, the Acoustics Subgroup has assessed each ISS module's in flight sound levels, produced by a large number of vehicle and science experiment noise sources, to assure compliance with strict acoustic standards.   The acoustic environment on ISS changed when additional modules were added during its construction, and as additional spacecraft arrive at the ISS.  The Acoustics Subgroup has responded to this dynamic operations schedule by successfully designing and employing acoustic covers, absorptive materials, [[Noise barrier|noise barriers]], and vibration isolators to reduce noise levels. Moreover, when pumps, fans, and ventilation systems age and show increased noise levels,  this Acoustics Subgroup has guided ISS managers to replace the older, noisier instruments with quiet fan and pump technologies, significantly reducing [[Ambient noise level|ambient noise levels]].\n\nNASA has adopted most-conservative damage risk criteria (based on recommendations from the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] and the [[World Health Organization]]), in order to protect all crew members.  The MMOP Acoustics Subgroup has adjusted its approach to managing noise risks in this unique environment by applying, or modifying, terrestrial approaches for hearing loss prevention to set these conservative limits.  One innovative approach has been NASA's Noise Exposure Estimation Tool (NEET), in which noise exposures are calculated in a task-based approach to determine the need for [[Hearing protection device|hearing protection devices]] (HPDs).  Guidance for use of HPDs, either mandatory use or recommended, is then documented in the Noise Hazard Inventory, and posted for crew reference during their missions. The Acoustics Subgroup also tracks spacecraft noise exceedances, applies [[engineering controls]], and recommends hearing protective devices to reduce crew noise exposures. Finally, hearing thresholds are monitored on-orbit, during missions . \n\nThere have been no persistent mission-related hearing threshold shifts among US Orbital Segment crewmembers (JAXA, CSA, ESA, NASA) during what is approaching 20 years of ISS mission operations, or nearly 175,000 work hours. In 2020, the MMOP Acoustics Subgroup received the [[Safe-In-Sound Award]] for Innovation for their combined efforts to mitigate any health effects of noise.[https://www.safeinsound.us/winners.html]\n\n===Fire and toxic gases===\nAn onboard fire or a toxic gas leak are other potential hazards.

It was released on May 28, 2010 in Europe, in North America on June 14, and in Australia on August 26.<ref>http://www.jowood.at/?lang=en&site=10</ref><ref>http://www.gamefaqs.com/ds/960397-legend-of-kay/data</ref>\n\nThere were also [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] versions of the game released digitally in North America.\n\n==Plot==\nFor many generations, the mystical land of Yenching had been inhabited by many animals, mainly cats, hares, frogs, and pandas. Because of a religious code called the Way, these four races had prospered throughout the ages in their own separate towns. But as the years passed, the younger generations began to defect from the Way. Ultimately, with no protective code to guide the races, Yenching was invaded by the Gorillas and the Rats (known as the Din), led by Gorilla Minister Shun and Tak, the Rat Alchemist. Minister Shun now rules the majority of Yenching with an iron fist, and is said to reside in the volcanic mountain of Waa-Lo.\n\nThe story now focuses around a figure named Kay. Kay is a hotheaded young cat, and the Master's finest martial arts student. Like many of the people of the races, Kay does not believe in the Way, and likes to focus on physical skills and strength. This is what makes his friend, Su Ling, leave his town in disgust, hoping to find another town that would share her belief in resurrecting the Way. One day, in Kay's martial arts school, Shun's gorillas and the mayor of Kay's town declare that they must shut down the school because new 'Din schools' must soon be erected in the town. Kay is outraged, and even more so when his Master simply agrees to the new terms. And so, making up his mind, Kay sneaks into his Master's house at night (the Master is drunk, and asleep) and steals the mystical blade the Master keeps. Kay then jumps out of the town walls, and makes his way into the wilderness.\n\nKay's exploits vary from traversing to the Haretree (the secret residence of all the hares of Yenching), befriending a dragon (and almost getting fried in the process), traveling through dangerous swamps in order to reach Frog City (the city of frogs, obviously), and riding on a dragon to get to the Forbidden City (the city of pandas, located on a plateau), all the while defeating hordes of rats, crocodiles, turtles, bears, ladybugs, and gorillas. There, in the  Forbidden City, Kay finds his friend Su Ling, who is now a ringleader of the Avalanche, a group of pandas who are dedicated to the revival of the Way, and stopping Shun and the army of Din. After helping them out, the Avalanche begins its voyage to island of Waa-Lo, with Kay in tow. After an arduous voyage, Kay and the Avalanche begin to explore the caves of Waa-Lo, making their way to the center of the volcano. During the expedition, Kay finally catches up with Tak, the rat alchemist. After defeating him, Kay meets Shun in person. The two engage in a fierce duel, with Kay being the victor. Injured, Shun runs to the contraption he and Tak created. The fires of Waa-Lo power up the machine, and begin to fuse Shun and one of his bodyguards into a single, monstrous ape-like entity. With no choice left but to fight, Kay begins to do battle with the monster. As Kay strikes the final blow, Waa-Lo begins to erupt. Luckily, the Avalanche sends a rescue team, via a hot-air balloon.\n\nAs Kay, Su Ling, and the Avalanche (all back in the ship) stare across the horizon at the exploding volcano, the merchant (who the pandas have seemingly saved) tries to sell some souvenirs to Kay and Su Ling. With a grin, Kay pulls off the merchant's rice hat to reveal the Master himself. Kay jokes about finally having to ''master'' his abilities by outfoxing his master. Kay, Su Ling, and the Master all then begin to laugh, the ship returning for a free Yenching.\n\n== Remaster ==\n''Legend of Kay Anniversary'', a version of the game with improved graphics and online leaderboards for players to compare scores, was released on [[Personal computer|PC]], [[Mac OS|Mac]], [[PlayStation 4]], and the [[Nintendo Wii U]] on July 28, 2015.

{"title_page": "Gordon Tucker", "text_new": "{{for|the English footballer|Gordon Tucker (footballer)}}\n{{more footnotes|date=August 2012}}\n'''Gordon Tucker''' is a prominent [[rabbi]], with a reputation as both a political and a theological liberal in [[Conservative Judaism]]. He recently retired as the senior rabbi of Temple Israel Center in [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], [[New York (state)|New York]].\n\n==Education and career==\n\nA 1967 graduate of the [[Bronx High School of Science]], Tucker holds the [[A.B.]] degree from [[Harvard College]] and a [[PhD]]. (in Philosophy) from [[Princeton University]]. He was ordained a Rabbi in 1975 by The [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] (JTS). He has served on the faculty of JTS since 1976, currently serving as Adjunct Assistant Professor of [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[philosophy]], in addition to his duties as a congregational rabbi. From 1984 to 1992 he served as dean of the Rabbinical School at JTS.  He subsequently became rabbi of [[Temple Israel Center]] in White Plains, New York, following the retirement of Rabbi Arnold S.

[[Arnold Eisen]] was ultimately chosen for the position.\n\n== Philosophy of Conservative Judaism ==\nTucker, in his writings about the Torah and the nature of divine revelation, is a leader within [[Conservative Judaism]] in articulating a position between the traditional view that the Torah is of divine origin, and a secular view, in which the Torah is seen entirely as a work of human creation. He writes, \"It is the particular characteristic of Conservative Judaism to insist that religious authority is a partnership, that it comes from the reality of a revealing God and the equally inescapable reality of a seeking, evolving community through which God's words get expressed over time.\" The Torah, according to Tucker, \"is not a\nrecord of commanding utterances from God, but rather a record of the religious quests of a people, and of their understanding of how\nGod\u2019s will commands them.\"<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Tucker_Final.pdf \n |format=PDF \n |title=\u05d3\u05e8\u05d5\u05e9 \u05d5\u05e7\u05d1\u05dc \u05e9\u05db\u05e8: Halakhic and Metahalakhic Arguments Concerning  Judaism and Homosexuality \n |author=Gordon Tucker \n |accessdate=2007-03-07 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613204728/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Tucker_Final.pdf \n |archivedate=2007-06-13 \n}}</ref>\n\nTucker's liberalism and interest in philosophy reflect his role in Conservative Judaism as a leading scholar and interpreter of the works of [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]] (1907\u20131972). Heschel, a rabbi who escaped the Holocaust in Europe through the help of Hebrew Union College and ultimately joined the faculty of Jewish Theological Seminary, became famous not only for his many religious and philosophical commentaries, but also for his social activism and support of the [[Civil Rights]] movement.\n\nIn the 1950s and '60s, the two most famous scholars at [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]] were Heschel and [[Mordechai Kaplan]] (1881\u20131983). Gordon Tucker began his studies at Jewish Theological Seminary at a time when both Kaplan and Heschel were living. Both Kaplan and Heschel confronted more traditional elements within Conservative Judaism, but each of them sought to redefine Judaism in different ways. While Kaplan favored a positivist, rationalist, and scientific approach to Judaism, Heschel's approach was philosophical, mystical, and spiritual. In effect, Heschel and Kaplan offered competing approaches to the liberalization of Jewish theology.\n\nGordon Tucker's liberalism could be said to reflect Heschel's own political activism. According to [[Neil Gillman]], a historian of Conservative Judaism, \"Heschel insisted that his turn to political activism was prompted by his experience of living in Europe in the decades before World War II. He had been a personal witness to political oppression and was painfully aware that many otherwise good people stood on the sidelines and did not intervene. He was not going to repeat that pattern in America.\" Heschel's mystical spirituality lead him to become a champion within American Jewry of liberal causes and political activism.<ref>{{cite book | author=Neil Gillman | title=Conservative Judaism: The New Century | date=July 1993 | publisher=Behrman House Publishing | isbn=978-0-87441-547-6 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/conservativejuda0000gill }}</ref>\n\nBut Tucker is not a follower of Heschel, in the same sense that Kaplan had followers within Conservative Judaism. Rather, he is a follower of what he understands to be Heschel's tradition. For Tucker, Jewish law cannot be expressed solely through a ''positivist'' legal framework. It is motivated by an underlying and evolving sense of God's will through a process in which human beings play a critical role. To find precedent for changing Jewish law, Tucker analyzes evolving Jewish moral and legal traditions. Just as Heschel did, he turns to [[aggadah]], the non-legalistic writings that are part of the oral and written tradition of Torah scholarship. He writes that Judaism has developed a precedent over time that rejects \"the practice of punishing people, and causing them undue suffering, for things they are not responsible for.\" Ultimately, his proposal for a new halakhic response to homosexuality was based on this precedent.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Tucker_Final.pdf \n |format=PDF \n |title=Halakhic and Metahalakhic Arguments Concerning  Judaism and Homosexuality \n |author=Gordon Tucker \n |accessdate=March 7, 2007 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613204728/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Tucker_Final.pdf \n |archivedate=June 13, 2007 \n}}</ref>\n\n== Proposed takkanah on homosexuality ==\nTucker's prominence as both a political and theological liberal within Conservative Judaism is reflected in the role he played in the movement's recent debates on the issue of homosexuality. As a member of the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] (CJLS), he authored a proposed [[teshuvah]] (responsa) arguing that the biblical prohibition on male homosexuality should be overturned. In doing so, he proposed that the Conservative movement should accept a new, more liberal approach to halakhah (Jewish law). (Tucker originally offered his paper as a responsum, but the committee voted instead to consider it as a [[takkanah]], requiring 13 votes for adoption.)\n\nAn important difference between Conservative and Orthodox Judaism is that Conservative Judaism empowers modern rabbis to issue [[takkanah|takkanot]] (decrees) modifying Biblical prohibitions, when perceived to be necessary. However, such decrees must be rooted in halakhic process and precedent. Conservative Judaism has adopted takkanot only for a few exceptional matters, such as the abolition of the biblical category of [[mamzer]] (a child whose mother is married to a someone other than the biological father or is the product of an incestuous relationship). Orthodox Judaism takes a more limited view as to how law can be changed.\n\nBoth Conservative and Orthodox Judaism address most questions of Jewish law through [[responsa]], through a written, rabbinical interpretation of Jewish law, analogous to a court decision. In Orthodox Judaism, responsa are the product of individual rabbis, and their authority derives from the recognition of the author within the larger Orthodox community as a [[posek]] or decisor. In Conservative Judaism, both responsa and takkanot are products of the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, whose voting members are ordained rabbis within the Conservative movement.\n\nOn December 6, 2006, The CJLS adopted three different responsa, somewhat contradictory, on issues that address the participation of male homosexuals in Conservative Judaism:\n\n* By 13 of 25 votes, the minimum majority, the CJLS adopted a responsum authored by Rabbi [[Elliot N. Dorff]], [[Daniel Nevins]], and [[Avram Reisner]], lifting most restrictions on homosexual conduct and opening the way to the ordination of openly gay and lesbian rabbis and acceptance of homosexual unions, but stopping short of religiously recognizing gay marriage. The responsum maintained the Biblical prohibition on male-male anal sex.\n* Also by 13 of 25 votes, the committee adopted a traditionalist responsum, by Rabbi Joel Roth, reaffirming a general prohibition on homosexual conduct.\n* By six votes, the minimum for adoption as a minority position, the committee approved another responsum by Rabbi Leonard Levy, delineating ways in which to ensure that gays and lesbians would be accorded human dignity and a respected place in Conservative communities and institutions while maintaining the authority of the traditional prohibitions against same-sex sexual activity.\n\nThe Committee rejected Gordon Tucker's takkanah. Details of this issue are discussed in [[Conservative Halakha]]. Tucker's proposed takhanah became, in effect, a dissenting opinion.\n\n== Translation and commentary on Heschel ==\nRabbi Tucker's most widely known scholarly work is his translation with notes and commentaries of writings of [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]]. Tucker translated Heschel's ''Torah min HaShamayim BeAspaklariah shel HaDorot'' (''Heavenly Torah as Refracted through the Generations'') from the original Hebrew into English, and provided many notes, essays, and commentaries.\n\nIn her forward to ''Heavenly Torah'', Heschel's daughter [[Susannah Heschel]] describes the scope and magnitude of this translation.  \"Gordon Tucker (and Rabbi Leonard Levin) have done a superb job of assembling, editing, abridging, and translating a huge, not-quite-finished manuscript. Others literally died trying to translate this sprawling masterpiece. There may be some dissent from the inevitable omissions, some few typos, some doubts about Tucker's interpretations. But on the whole, the introductions to each chapter, the explanatory notes on almost every page (including identifying Heschel's often obscure sources) are wonderful aids in working through this massive work.\"\n\nHeschel differed with the more legalistic approach to Torah of the Lithuanian rabbis who dominated the interpretation of [[halacha]] and the exegesis of Torah in the 20th century. He emphasized [[aggadah]] and [[midrash]], the often speculative writings of the rabbinical sages that were outside the Torah's legal framework. Because these writings were not as heavily edited or redacted as the [[Mishna]] and [[Gemara]], Heschel's Hebrew manuscript reflects a variety of difficult Hebrew prose styles. Or N. Rose, a reviewer of ''Heavenly Torah'', praised Tucker and Levin for capturing the qualities of Heschel's original manuscript in their translation. \"Not only is this English version a lucid and thoughtful reworking of the original text, but Tucker and Levin even manage to introduce into their translation a measure of the poeticism readers have come to expect of Heschel.\"{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n==Family life==\n\nTucker is currently married to Dr. Amy Cohn, with whom he has a son and daughter, Micah and Becky. He was previously married to [[Hadassah Lieberman|Hadassah Freilich (now Lieberman)]], with whom he has a son, Rabbi [[Ethan Tucker]], a [[rosh yeshiva]] at [[Yeshivat Hadar]]. His first wife later married [[Joseph Lieberman|Senator Joseph Lieberman]], who became the first Jewish candidate for national office with a major political party.\n\n== References ==\n<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------\n  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for a\n  discussion of different citation methods and how to generate\n  footnotes using the <ref>, </ref> and  <reference /> tags\n----------------------------------------------------------- -->\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110615050224/http://www.thejewishweek.com/features/all_eyes_rabbi_tucker_panel  All Eyes On Rabbi Tucker At Panel], ''[[The Jewish Week]]''\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060303102720/http://hazon.org/go.php?q=%2Fabout%2Fz_bios%2FGordonTucker.html Hazon Bio]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060223120318/http://templeisraelcenter.org/about_us/who_we_are.php?page=133 Temple Israel of White Plains bio (official)]\n* [http://www.forward.com/articles/1673 Forward article]\n* Heschel, Abraham Joshua.

Alexander led Murray State for four seasons, posting a 45-54 record, including a 15-10 mark in 1955-56. But after his first team was Ohio Valley Conference regular-season and tournament runners-up, his teams never finished higher than third in the conference and he was replaced by DePauw University head coach Cal Luther on March 5, 1958. Alexander agreed to stay on as an assistant coach under Luther.\n\n===Luther era (1959\u20131974)===\n\nIn 1958, Murray State hired [[Cal Luther]], who had served the previous four seasons as head coach at [[DePauw Tigers|DePauw]]. In 16 seasons under Luther, Murray State won three OVC regular-season championships and made the NCAA Tournament in [[1964 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1964]] and [[1969 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1969]]. His 1970-71 team reached No. 17 in the [[Associated Press Poll|Associated Press poll]], entering the rankings after a thrilling 73-71 victory over [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|Western Kentucky]] in Murray. WKU would go on to reach the [[1971 NCAA Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] Final Four that season. A two-time OVC Coach of the Year, Luther led the Racers to a 241-134 record.\n\nLuther's most notable players were future professional players [[Dick Cunningham]], [[Claude Virden]] and [[Stew Johnson|Stewart Johnson]], as well as Racer greats Herb McPherson, Jim Jennings and Les Taylor.\n\nCal Luther was a firebrand of a coach. The standing joke at the university was the over and under of Cal throwing off his jacket during a game due to a call by a ref, or from frustration with a player. The latter part of his tenure was marred by an OVC issue with testing and which tests the schools in the OVC used to qualify athletes. During the 1973-74 season several players were disqualified for using an illegal testing equivalency. This happened across the OVC, and Murray was not the only school to lose student athletes. Most of the disqualified athletes were allowed to transfer by the NCAA to other schools, but OVC schools lost the services of those athletes who had not actually taken the SAT, but had taken the ACT.\n\n===Overton era (1975\u20131978)===\n\nAfter three seasons as an assistant under Cal Luther, [[Fred Overton]] was elevated to head coach in 1975. After a 9-17 first season, the Racers started the 1976-77 season with a 17-6 record before dropping their last four games for a 17-10 final ledger, finishing second in the OVC. But after the Racers posted an 8-17 in 1977-78, Overton was fired.<ref>[http://racerhistory.com Racerhistory.com]</ref>\n\n===Greene era (1978\u20131985)===\n[[Ron Greene]] returned to his alma mater fresh off earning the AP Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year award at Mississippi State in 1978.\n\nAfter managing only four wins in his first season as coach at Murray, Greene led the Racers to 23 wins the following year and an appearance in the [[National Invitation Tournament]]. The Racers knocked off Jacksonville and Alabama before losing to Illinois 65-63 in the quarterfinals, all on the road. Greene's Racers would win three Ohio Valley Conference regular-season titles and reach the NIT twice more under his guidance.\n\nA highlight of the 1981\u201382 season came when Murray State traveled to South Bend, Indiana, to play against [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]].  Murray State defeated a [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]] team coached by [[Digger Phelps]] 56-54.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/08/sports/murray-state-56-notre-dame-54.html | work=The New York Times | title=Murray State 56 Notre Dame 54 | date=8 December 1981}}</ref>\n\nHis overall record at Murray State was 119-78.

Martin did not make the team but impressed many with his performance.\n\nThe best-known player in the Newton era is [[Popeye Jones]].  While at Murray State, Jones scored 2,057 points which still ranks fourth all time for the Racers. He is also Murray State's all-time leader in rebounds with 1,374, and led the nation in that category in the 1990\u201391 season. Jones is the only player in MSU history to record more than 2,000 points and 1,000 rebounds.  Jones helped lead the Racers to OVC championships in 1991 and 1992. He went on to have a successful career in the NBA after being drafted in the second round by the [[Houston Rockets]] in the 1992 NBA Draft.\n\n===Edgar era (1992\u20131995)===\n\n[[Scott Edgar (basketball)|Scott Edgar]] was hired as head basketball coach after serving six seasons as an assistant coach under [[Nolan Richardson]] at [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|Arkansas]]. Bringing a version of Richardson's uptempo \"40 Minutes of Hell\" philosophy to Murray, Edgar led the Racers to two NCAA tournament appearances ([[1992 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1992]], [[1995 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1995]]) and one NIT appearance ([[1994 National Invitation Tournament|1994]]) in four seasons. His teams won three OVC regular-season championships (1992, 1994 and 1995), posting a 48-14 record in conference games during his tenure.\n\nEdgar recruited Racer greats [[Marcus Brown]] and Vincent Rainey to Murray State, with Brown averaging 22.4 points and Rainey 18.8 points in Edgar's final season at Murray.\n\nEdgar left Murray State after the 1994-95 season to become head coach at [[Duquesne Dukes men's basketball|Duquesne]].\n\n===Gottfried era (1995\u20131998)===\n[[Mark Gottfried]] was hired as head basketball coach after serving seven seasons as an assistant coach under [[Jim Harrick]] at [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]]. Gottfried was hired shortly after he finished the 1995 season with the Bruins, in which he helped lead the Bruins to an [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]]. Mark Gottfried was also the nephew of ESPN analyst and former Murray State football coach [[Mike Gottfried]].\n\nIn Gottfried's first season, the Racers returned four starters, including [[Marcus Brown]], from the Racer team that nearly upset North Carolina in the 1995 NCAA Tournament, and the team was picked to finished first in the OVC. The Racers won the Ohio Valley Conference regular season championship in 1996 for the third straight season; however, the Racers were defeated in the OVC tournament. In the final game of the tournament, Murray State's Vincent Rainey was charged with a foul with two-tenths of a second left on the clock in a tie game against the rival [[Austin Peay Governors]]. APSU's Reggie Crenshaw made two free throws and the Racers lost the game 70-68. As a result of the loss, the Racers did not reach the 1996 NCAA Tournament. The Racers lost to the [[Missouri Tigers]] in the opening round of the 1996 National Invitational Tournament, and finished the season 19-10. [[Marcus Brown]] finished his college playing career at the close of the 1996 season with 2,236 career points, which is third best in Murray State history.\n\nWith a November 23, 1996, victory over the [[Belmont Bruins men's basketball|Belmont Bruins]], the Racers began a 47-game home winning streak that would last into the 1999\u20132000 season. The Racers won the 1997 OVC Tournament with an overtime win over Austin Peay and earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nESPN's College Basketball Encyclopedia names the Racers 1997\u201398 season as having the best team in school history. OVC player of the year De'Teri Mayes led the 1997\u201398 team to 23 victories by double digit margins. Isaac Spencer was a freshman on the team. Spencer would go on to score 2,248 points over four seasons, which places him second place all time for the Racers. The Racers won both the OVC regular season and OVC tournament again in 1998; however, Murray State fell to number eight seed Rhode Island in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. The Racers finished the season a number 25 ranking in the final AP Poll. Mark Gottfried won three Ohio Valley Conference Championships in each of his three seasons, the only OVC coach to accomplish such a mark.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Mark Gottfried''|work=Rolltide.com|url=http://www.rolltide.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=8000&ATCLID=239593|date=2002-05-02|accessdate=2007-03-05}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>''ESPN College Basketball Encyclopedia: The Complete History of the Men's Game''. 2009. p 31.</ref>\n\nGottfried was hired by [[Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball|Alabama]] to be head basketball coach in March 1998. He had been a starting player for the Crimson Tide for three seasons between 1985 and 1987.\n\n===Anderson era (1998\u20132003)===\n[[Tevester Anderson]] was promoted to head coach of the Racers in March, 1998 after [[Mark Gottfried]] left Murray State to take the head coach position at the [[University of Alabama]]. Anderson, the first African American to serve as head coach of the Murray State men's basketball team, had previously served as an assistant coach under Gottfried during the previous three seasons. At age 61, Anderson was also the oldest rookie head coach in NCAA Division I basketball. In his first year as coach of the Racers, Anderson led the team to a 27-6 record, an Ohio Valley Conference championship, and an NCAA Tournament appearance. Anderson was named the OVC's Co-Coach of the Year and was named NABC District 7 Coach of the Year following the 1998\u201399 season.<ref>\"Anderson Hired at Murray State\". ''Kentucky New Era''. March 28, 1998. p 3B.</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1015130/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Rookie Of The Year | date=22 February 1999}}</ref>\n\nIn Anderson's second year as head coach, the Racers finished the 1999\u20132000 season with a 23-9 record. The record was good enough to capture a share of the OVC regular season championship, but the Racer's failed to win the OVC Tournament and earn a spot in the NCAA Tournament. Murray State home court winning streak, the longest in the nation, also came to an end in 2000 with a January 15 loss to [[Southeast Missouri State University]].\n\nOver the next three years under Anderson, the success of the Racer basketball program steadily declined, culminating in a low point during the 2002\u201303 season. The Racers finished the 2002\u201303 season with a 17-12 record, which was fourth-place in the OVC standings. The fourth-place finish was the worst finish in the OVC standings since the 1986\u201387 season. Amid rumors that Anderson would relinquish his coaching duties at Murray State under pressure from university officials, he resigned from the head coach position in March 2003.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://murrayledger.com/anderson-retires-as-racers-head-coach/article_07d9a74c-dd7b-575b-95a4-23568d84d141.html |title=Anderson retires as Racers' head coach - Murray Ledger & Times: Home |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2003-03-24 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref> Anderson was named as the new head coach at [[Jackson State University]] in April 2003.<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://murrayledger.com/anderson-to-take-over-at-jackson-state/article_a355ded1-0ab3-5b7c-982b-5d678d5c2169.html |title=Anderson to take over at Jackson State - Murray Ledger & Times: Home |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2003-04-09 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref>\n\n===Cronin era (2003\u20132006)===\nPreviously an assistant at [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati]] (1997\u20132001) under [[Bob Huggins]] and at [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]] (2001\u201303) under [[Rick Pitino]], Mick Cronin was introduced as the new head coach of the Racers on April 5, 2003. When he accepted the position, Cronin became the fourth youngest head coach in NCAA Division-I basketball. In Cronin's first season as head coach, the Racers won the OVC tournament and advanced to the first round of the NCAA Tournament where the Racers fell to No. 5 seeded Illinois. The success of the 2003\u201304 season was also tainted by arrests and suspensions. Just before the start of the 2004 NCAA Tournament, juniors Adam Chiles and Kelvin Brown were arrested on drug charges. Chiles was charged with hindering prosecution and possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, and Brown was charged with theft from an alleged gas drive-off, possession of marijuana, and his second offense of possession of drug paraphernalia. Both were arrested following a 911 hangup call from their apartment in which Chiles was found outside and Brown was found hiding in a closet. Chiles was cleared to play in the tournament, but Brown was suspended indefinitely and later dismissed from the team in April.<ref>\"Drugs, suspension taint Racers' glorious season\". The Murray State News. March 26, 2004. p 1</ref>\n\nProblems continued for the Racers in the 2004\u201305 season. The team's only returning starter, Adam Chiles, was dismissed from the team in November following his second arrest of 2004. Chiles was stopped by Kentucky State Police while driving on [[Western Kentucky Parkway]] near [[Leitchfield, Kentucky]]. Chiles was charged with driving under the influence, possession of marijuana, possession of an open alcoholic beverage container, and speeding. Chiles had averaged 10.1 points and 3.9 assists for the Racers in the previous season. The Racers went on to finish the 2004\u201305 season with a record of 20-10 and a first round loss in the OVC tournament.<ref>\"Murray State dismisses player after arrest\". Portsmouth Daily Times.

This was the first time that any Ohio Valley Conference team had advanced to the 2nd round of the NCAA Tournament since [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders|Middle Tennessee]] advanced in 1989. The Racers followed up a regular season conference championship for the second year in a row in 2011. The Racers were eliminated from the OVC tournament in 2011; however, they earned a number six seed in the [[National Invitational Tournament]] where the Racers suffered a first round loss to [[Missouri State University]].

Alexander led Murray State for four seasons, posting a 45-54 record, including a 15-10 mark in 1955-56. But after his first team was Ohio Valley Conference regular-season and tournament runners-up, his teams never finished higher than third in the conference and he was replaced by DePauw University head coach Cal Luther on March 5, 1958. Alexander agreed to stay on as an assistant coach under Luther.\n\n===Luther era (1959\u20131974)===\n\nIn 1958, Murray State hired [[Cal Luther]], who had served the previous four seasons as head coach at [[DePauw Tigers|DePauw]]. In 16 seasons under Luther, Murray State won three OVC regular-season championships and made the NCAA Tournament in [[1964 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1964]] and [[1969 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1969]]. His 1970-71 team reached No. 17 in the [[Associated Press Poll|Associated Press poll]], entering the rankings after a thrilling 73-71 victory over [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|Western Kentucky]] in Murray. WKU would go on to reach the [[1971 NCAA Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] Final Four that season. A two-time OVC Coach of the Year, Luther led the Racers to a 241-134 record.\n\nLuther's most notable players were future professional players [[Dick Cunningham]], [[Claude Virden]] and [[Stew Johnson|Stewart Johnson]], as well as Racer greats Herb McPherson, Jim Jennings and Les Taylor.\n\nCal Luther was a firebrand of a coach. The standing joke at the university was the over and under of Cal throwing off his jacket during a game due to a call by a ref, or from frustration with a player. The latter part of his tenure was marred by an OVC issue with testing and which tests the schools in the OVC used to qualify athletes. During the 1973-74 season several players were disqualified for using an illegal testing equivalency. This happened across the OVC, and Murray was not the only school to lose student athletes. Most of the disqualified athletes were allowed to transfer by the NCAA to other schools, but OVC schools lost the services of those athletes who had not actually taken the SAT, but had taken the ACT.\n\n===Overton era (1975\u20131978)===\n\nAfter three seasons as an assistant under Cal Luther, [[Fred Overton]] was elevated to head coach in 1975. After a 9-17 first season, the Racers started the 1976-77 season with a 17-6 record before dropping their last four games for a 17-10 final ledger, finishing second in the OVC. But after the Racers posted an 8-17 in 1977-78, Overton was fired.<ref>[http://racerhistory.com Racerhistory.com]</ref>\n\n===Greene era (1978\u20131985)===\n[[Ron Greene]] returned to his alma mater fresh off earning the AP Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year award at Mississippi State in 1978.\n\nAfter managing only four wins in his first season as coach at Murray, Greene led the Racers to 23 wins the following year and an appearance in the [[National Invitation Tournament]]. The Racers knocked off Jacksonville and Alabama before losing to Illinois 65-63 in the quarterfinals, all on the road. Greene's Racers would win three Ohio Valley Conference regular-season titles and reach the NIT twice more under his guidance.\n\nA highlight of the 1981\u201382 season came when Murray State traveled to South Bend, Indiana, to play against [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]].  Murray State defeated a [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]] team coached by [[Digger Phelps]] 56-54.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/08/sports/murray-state-56-notre-dame-54.html | work=The New York Times | title=Murray State 56 Notre Dame 54 | date=8 December 1981}}</ref>\n\nHis overall record at Murray State was 119-78.

He is also Murray State's all-time leader in rebounds with 1,374, and led the nation in that category in the 1990\u201391 season. Jones is the only player in MSU history to record more than 2,000 points and 1,000 rebounds.  Jones helped lead the Racers to OVC championships in 1991 and 1992. He went on to have a successful career in the NBA after being drafted in the second round by the [[Houston Rockets]] in the 1992 NBA Draft.\n\n===Edgar era (1992\u20131995)===\n\n[[Scott Edgar (basketball)|Scott Edgar]] was hired as head basketball coach after serving six seasons as an assistant coach under [[Nolan Richardson]] at [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|Arkansas]]. Bringing a version of Richardson's uptempo \"40 Minutes of Hell\" philosophy to Murray, Edgar led the Racers to two NCAA tournament appearances ([[1992 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1992]], [[1995 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1995]]) and one NIT appearance ([[1994 National Invitation Tournament|1994]]) in four seasons. His teams won three OVC regular-season championships (1992, 1994 and 1995), posting a 48-14 record in conference games during his tenure.\n\nEdgar recruited Racer greats [[Marcus Brown]] and Vincent Rainey to Murray State, with Brown averaging 22.4 points and Rainey 18.8 points in Edgar's final season at Murray.\n\nEdgar left Murray State after the 1994-95 season to become head coach at [[Duquesne Dukes men's basketball|Duquesne]].\n\n===Gottfried era (1995\u20131998)===\n[[Mark Gottfried]] was hired as head basketball coach after serving seven seasons as an assistant coach under [[Jim Harrick]] at [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]]. Gottfried was hired shortly after he finished the 1995 season with the Bruins, in which he helped lead the Bruins to an [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]]. Mark Gottfried was also the nephew of ESPN analyst and former Murray State football coach [[Mike Gottfried]].\n\nIn Gottfried's first season, the Racers returned four starters, including [[Marcus Brown]], from the Racer team that nearly upset North Carolina in the 1995 NCAA Tournament, and the team was picked to finished first in the OVC. The Racers won the Ohio Valley Conference regular season championship in 1996 for the third straight season; however, the Racers were defeated in the OVC tournament. In the final game of the tournament, Murray State's Vincent Rainey was charged with a foul with two-tenths of a second left on the clock in a tie game against the rival [[Austin Peay Governors]]. APSU's Reggie Crenshaw made two free throws and the Racers lost the game 70-68. As a result of the loss, the Racers did not reach the 1996 NCAA Tournament. The Racers lost to the [[Missouri Tigers]] in the opening round of the 1996 National Invitational Tournament, and finished the season 19-10. [[Marcus Brown]] finished his college playing career at the close of the 1996 season with 2,236 career points, which is third best in Murray State history.\n\nWith a November 23, 1996, victory over the [[Belmont Bruins men's basketball|Belmont Bruins]], the Racers began a 47-game home winning streak that would last into the 1999\u20132000 season. The Racers won the 1997 OVC Tournament with an overtime win over Austin Peay and earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nESPN's College Basketball Encyclopedia names the Racers 1997\u201398 season as having the best team in school history. OVC player of the year De'Teri Mayes led the 1997\u201398 team to 23 victories by double digit margins. Isaac Spencer was a freshman on the team. Spencer would go on to score 2,248 points over four seasons, which places him second place all time for the Racers. The Racers won both the OVC regular season and OVC tournament again in 1998; however, Murray State fell to number eight seed Rhode Island in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. The Racers finished the season a number 25 ranking in the final AP Poll. Mark Gottfried won three Ohio Valley Conference Championships in each of his three seasons, the only OVC coach to accomplish such a mark.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Mark Gottfried''|work=Rolltide.com|url=http://www.rolltide.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=8000&ATCLID=239593|date=2002-05-02|accessdate=2007-03-05}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>''ESPN College Basketball Encyclopedia: The Complete History of the Men's Game''. 2009. p 31.</ref>\n\nGottfried was hired by [[Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball|Alabama]] to be head basketball coach in March 1998. He had been a starting player for the Crimson Tide for three seasons between 1985 and 1987.\n\n===Anderson era (1998\u20132003)===\n[[Tevester Anderson]] was promoted to head coach of the Racers in March, 1998 after [[Mark Gottfried]] left Murray State to take the head coach position at the [[University of Alabama]]. Anderson, the first African American to serve as head coach of the Murray State men's basketball team, had previously served as an assistant coach under Gottfried during the previous three seasons. At age 61, Anderson was also the oldest rookie head coach in NCAA Division I basketball. In his first year as coach of the Racers, Anderson led the team to a 27-6 record, an Ohio Valley Conference championship, and an NCAA Tournament appearance. Anderson was named the OVC's Co-Coach of the Year and was named NABC District 7 Coach of the Year following the 1998\u201399 season.<ref>\"Anderson Hired at Murray State\". ''Kentucky New Era''.

The record was good enough to capture a share of the OVC regular season championship, but the Racer's failed to win the OVC Tournament and earn a spot in the NCAA Tournament. Murray State home court winning streak, the longest in the nation, also came to an end in 2000 with a January 15 loss to [[Southeast Missouri State University]].\n\nOver the next three years under Anderson, the success of the Racer basketball program steadily declined, culminating in a low point during the 2002\u201303 season. The Racers finished the 2002\u201303 season with a 17-12 record, which was fourth-place in the OVC standings. The fourth-place finish was the worst finish in the OVC standings since the 1986\u201387 season. Amid rumors that Anderson would relinquish his coaching duties at Murray State under pressure from university officials, he resigned from the head coach position in March 2003.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://murrayledger.com/anderson-retires-as-racers-head-coach/article_07d9a74c-dd7b-575b-95a4-23568d84d141.html |title=Anderson retires as Racers' head coach - Murray Ledger & Times: Home |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2003-03-24 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref> Anderson was named as the new head coach at [[Jackson State University]] in April 2003.<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://murrayledger.com/anderson-to-take-over-at-jackson-state/article_a355ded1-0ab3-5b7c-982b-5d678d5c2169.html |title=Anderson to take over at Jackson State - Murray Ledger & Times: Home |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2003-04-09 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref>\n\n===Cronin era (2003\u20132006)===\nPreviously an assistant at [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati]] (1997\u20132001) under [[Bob Huggins]] and at [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]] (2001\u201303) under [[Rick Pitino]], Mick Cronin was introduced as the new head coach of the Racers on April 5, 2003. When he accepted the position, Cronin became the fourth youngest head coach in NCAA Division-I basketball. In Cronin's first season as head coach, the Racers won the OVC tournament and advanced to the first round of the NCAA Tournament where the Racers fell to No. 5 seeded Illinois. The success of the 2003\u201304 season was also tainted by arrests and suspensions. Just before the start of the 2004 NCAA Tournament, juniors Adam Chiles and Kelvin Brown were arrested on drug charges. Chiles was charged with hindering prosecution and possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, and Brown was charged with theft from an alleged gas drive-off, possession of marijuana, and his second offense of possession of drug paraphernalia. Both were arrested following a 911 hangup call from their apartment in which Chiles was found outside and Brown was found hiding in a closet. Chiles was cleared to play in the tournament, but Brown was suspended indefinitely and later dismissed from the team in April.<ref>\"Drugs, suspension taint Racers' glorious season\". The Murray State News. March 26, 2004. p 1</ref>\n\nProblems continued for the Racers in the 2004\u201305 season. The team's only returning starter, Adam Chiles, was dismissed from the team in November following his second arrest of 2004. Chiles was stopped by Kentucky State Police while driving on [[Western Kentucky Parkway]] near [[Leitchfield, Kentucky]]. Chiles was charged with driving under the influence, possession of marijuana, possession of an open alcoholic beverage container, and speeding. Chiles had averaged 10.1 points and 3.9 assists for the Racers in the previous season. The Racers went on to finish the 2004\u201305 season with a record of 20-10 and a first round loss in the OVC tournament.<ref>\"Murray State dismisses player after arrest\". Portsmouth Daily Times.

This was the first time that any Ohio Valley Conference team had advanced to the 2nd round of the NCAA Tournament since [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders|Middle Tennessee]] advanced in 1989. The Racers followed up a regular season conference championship for the second year in a row in 2011. The Racers were eliminated from the OVC tournament in 2011; however, they earned a number six seed in the [[National Invitational Tournament]] where the Racers suffered a first round loss to [[Missouri State University]].

The team's 23-0 start under Prohm was the best start to a season in team history. The 23-0 start beat the previous best start record of 16-0 set by the 1935\u201336 men's basketball team under [[Carlisle Cutchin]].
