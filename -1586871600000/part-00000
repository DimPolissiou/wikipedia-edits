[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] were attracted to the water of the Prairie Dog Town Fork Red River, as well as the consequent ample game, edible plants, and protection from the weather the canyon provided.\n\nThe first European explorers to discover the canyon were members of the [[Francisco V\u00e1squez de Coronado|Coronado expedition]], who visited the canyon in 1541. [[Apache Tribe|Apache]] Indians lived in Palo Duro at the time, but they were later displaced by [[Comanche]] and [[Kiowa]] tribes, who had the advantage of owning [[horse]]s brought over by the Spanish. They had contact with traders, called [[Comanchero]]s, in nearby [[New Mexico]].\n\nA United States military team under [[Captain (U.S. Army)|Captain]] [[Randolph B. Marcy]] mapped the canyon in 1852 during their search for the headwaters of the Red River. The land remained under American Indian control until a military expedition led by [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Ranald S. Mackenzie]] was sent in 1874 to remove the Indians to reservations in [[Oklahoma]]. The Mackenzie expedition captured about 1,200 of the Indians' horses and slaughtered them in nearby Tule Canyon during the [[Battle of Palo Duro Canyon]]. The Comanche and Kiowa conceded and left the area.\n\nSoon after, in 1876, [[Charles Goodnight]] and a wealthy [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scot],] named [[John George Adair|John Adair]] established the [[JA Ranch]] in Palo Duro Canyon. Col. Goodnight helped manage the ranch until 1890.  Over the next half-century, the canyon remained in private hands but was an increasingly popular tourist spot for local residents.\n\n[[Masterson, Texas#Charles N. Gould|Charles N. Gould]] made a [[geologic map]] of the canyon and named the [[formation (geology)|formations]] in 1905.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gould |first1=Charles |title=Covered Wagon Geologist |date=2003 |publisher=Textbook Publishers |isbn=9780758117069}}</ref>\n\nIn 1931, a major landowner signed a two-year contract with the local chamber of commerce to allow public access to the canyon.<ref>, Steely, James Wright.

Four groups of veterans, two groups of African Americans, and one junior group, took part in various construction projects, starting with the construction of Park Road 5, a two-lane road from the rim to the floor of the canyon.  Other projects included the headquarters building, [[culvert]]s, low-water crossings, bridges, Spring House, Well House, the Coronado Lodge interpretive center, 4 overnight cabins known as Cow Camp, and the 3 rim cabins.  In addition, picnic and camping areas were built, complete with tables, seats, fireplaces and garbage receptacles.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brandimarte |first1=Cynthia |last2=Reed |first2=Angela |title=Texas State Parks and the CCC: The Legacy of the Civilian Conservation Corps |date=2013 |publisher=Texas A&M University Press |location=College Station |isbn=9781623492960 |pages=35,148\u2013149}}</ref>\n\nThe Texas Department of Transportation has built bridges over Water crossings 1, 2, and 6 to allow motorists easier access during and after heavy rains.

[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] were attracted to the water of the Prairie Dog Town Fork Red River, as well as the consequent ample game, edible plants, and protection from the weather the canyon provided.\n\nThe first European explorers to discover the canyon were members of the [[Francisco V\u00e1squez de Coronado|Coronado expedition]], who visited the canyon in 1541. [[Apache Tribe|Apache]] Indians lived in Palo Duro at the time, but they were later displaced by [[Comanche]] and [[Kiowa]] tribes, who had the advantage of owning [[horse]]s brought over by the Spanish. They had contact with traders, called [[Comanchero]]s, in nearby [[New Mexico]].\n\nA United States military team under [[Captain (U.S. Army)|Captain]] [[Randolph B. Marcy]] mapped the canyon in 1852 during their search for the headwaters of the Red River. The land remained under American Indian control until a military expedition led by [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Ranald S. Mackenzie]] was sent in 1874 to remove the Indians to reservations in [[Oklahoma]]. The Mackenzie expedition captured about 1,200 of the Indians' horses and slaughtered them in nearby Tule Canyon during the [[Battle of Palo Duro Canyon]]. The Comanche and Kiowa conceded and left the area.\n\nSoon after, in 1876, [[Charles Goodnight]] and a wealthy [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scot],] named [[John George Adair|John Adair]] established the [[JA Ranch]] in Palo Duro Canyon. Col. Goodnight helped manage the ranch until 1890.  Over the next half-century, the canyon remained in private hands but was an increasingly popular tourist spot for local residents.\n\n[[Masterson, Texas#Charles N. Gould|Charles N. Gould]] made a [[geologic map]] of the canyon and named the [[formation (geology)|formations]] in 1905.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gould |first1=Charles |title=Covered Wagon Geologist |date=2003 |publisher=Textbook Publishers |isbn=9780758117069}}</ref>\n\nIn 1931, a major landowner signed a two-year contract with the local chamber of commerce to allow public access to the canyon.<ref>, Steely, James Wright.

Four groups of veterans, two groups of African Americans, and one junior group, took part in various construction projects, starting with the construction of Park Road 5, a two-lane road from the rim to the floor of the canyon.  Other projects included the headquarters building, [[culvert]]s, low-water crossings, bridges, Spring House, Well House, the Coronado Lodge interpretive center, 4 overnight cabins known as Cow Camp, and the 3 rim cabins.  In addition, picnic and camping areas were built, complete with tables, seats, fireplaces and garbage receptacles.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brandimarte |first1=Cynthia |last2=Reed |first2=Angela |title=Texas State Parks and the CCC: The Legacy of the Civilian Conservation Corps |date=2013 |publisher=Texas A&M University Press |location=College Station |isbn=9781623492960 |pages=35,148\u2013149}}</ref>\n\nThe Texas Department of Transportation has built bridges over Water crossings 1, 2, and 6 to allow motorists easier access during and after heavy rains.

{"title_page": "Complete intersection", "text_new": "{{for|complete intersection rings in commutative algebra, |complete intersection ring}}\nIn mathematics, an [[algebraic variety]] ''V'' in [[projective space]] is a '''complete intersection''' if the ideal of V is generated by exactly ''codim V'' elements. That is, if ''V'' has [[dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension]] ''m'' and  lies in projective space ''P''<sup>''n''</sup>, there should exist ''n'' \u2212 ''m'' homogeneous polynomials\n\n:''F''<sub>''i''</sub>(''X''<sub>0</sub>, ..., ''X''<sub>''n''</sub>), 1 \u2264 ''i'' \u2264 ''n'' \u2212 ''m'',\n\nin the [[homogeneous coordinates]] ''X''<sub>''j''</sub>, which generate all other homogeneous polynomials that vanish on V.\n\nGeometrically, each ''F''<sub>''i''</sub> defines a [[hypersurface]]; the intersection of these hypersurfaces should be ''V''. The intersection of ''n''-''m'' hypersurfaces will always have dimension at least ''m'', assuming that the field of scalars is an [[algebraically closed field]] such as the [[complex number]]s. The question is essentially, can we get the dimension down to ''m'', with no  extra points in the intersection? This condition is fairly hard to check as soon as the codimension ''n'' \u2212 ''m''  \u2265 2. When ''n'' \u2212 ''m'' = 1 then ''V'' is automatically a hypersurface and there is nothing to prove.\n\n== Examples ==\nEasy examples of complete intersections are given by hypersurfaces which are defined by the vanishing locus of a single polynomial. For example,\n:<math>\\mathbb{V}(x_0^5 + \\cdots + x_4^5) = \\text{Proj}\\left(\\frac{\\mathbb{F}[x_0,\\ldots,x_4]}{(x_0^5 + \\cdots + x_4^5)}\\right) \\xrightarrow{i} \\mathbb{P}^4_\\mathbb{F}</math>\ngives an example of a quintic threefold. It can be difficult to find explicit examples of complete intersections of higher dimensional varieties using two or more explicit examples(bestiary), but, there is an explicit example of a 3-fold of type <math>(2,4)</math> given by \n:<math>\\mathbb{V}(x_0^2 + x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4x_5, x_4^4 + x_5^4 - 2x_0x_1x_2x_3)</math>\n\n==Non-Examples==\n\n=== Twisted Cubic ===\nOne method for constructing local complete intersections is to take a projective complete intersection variety and embed it into a higher dimensional projective space. A classic example of this is the [[twisted cubic]] in <math>\\mathbb{P}_R^3</math>: it is a smooth local complete intersection meaning in any chart it can be expressed as the vanishing locus of two polynomials, but globally it is expressed by the vanishing locus of more than two polynomials. We can construct it using the very ample line bundle <math>\\mathcal{O}(3)</math> over <math>\\mathbb{P}^1</math> giving the embedding\n:<math>\\mathbb{P}_R^1 \\to \\mathbb{P}_R^3</math> by <math>[s:t] \\mapsto [s^3:s^2t:st^2:t^3]</math>\nNote that <math>\\Gamma(\\mathcal{O}(3)) = \\text{Span}_R\\{s^3,s^2t,st^2,t^3 \\}</math>. If we let <math>\\mathbb{P}^3_R = \\text{Proj}(R[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3])</math> the embedding gives the following relations:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nf_1 &= x_0x_3 - x_1x_2 \\\\\nf_2 &= x_1^2 - x_0x_2 \\\\\nf_3 &= x_2^2 - x_1x_3\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nHence the twisted cubic is the projective scheme\n:<math>\\text{Proj}\\left( \\frac{R[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3]}{(f_1,f_2,f_3)} \\right)</math>\n\n=== Union of Varieties Differing in Dimension ===\nAnother convenient way to construct a non complete intersection, which can never be a local complete intersection, is by taking the union of two different varieties where their dimensions do not agree. For example, the union of a line and a plane intersecting at a point is a classic example of this phenomenon. It is given by the scheme\n:<math>\n\\text{Spec}\\left( \\frac{\\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]}{(xz,yz)} \\right)\n</math>\n\n==Multidegree==\n\nA complete intersection has a ''multidegree'', written as the [[tuple]] (properly though a [[multiset]]) of the degrees of defining hypersurfaces. For example, taking quadrics in ''P''<sup>3</sup> again, (2,2) is the multidegree of the complete intersection of two of them, which when they are in [[general position]] is an [[elliptic curve]]. The [[Hodge number]]s of complex smooth complete intersections were worked out by [[Kunihiko Kodaira]].\n\n==General position==\n\nFor more refined questions, the nature of the intersection has to be addressed more closely. The hypersurfaces may be required to satisfy a [[Transversality (mathematics)|transversality]] condition (like their [[tangent space]]s being in general position at intersection points). The intersection may be [[Scheme-theoretic intersection|scheme-theoretic]], in other words here the [[homogeneous ideal]] generated by the ''F''<sub>''i''</sub>(''X''<sub>0</sub>, ..., ''X''<sub>''n''</sub>) may be required to be the defining ideal of ''V'', and not just have the correct [[radical of an ideal|radical]]. In [[commutative algebra]], the complete intersection condition is translated into [[regular sequence (algebra)|regular sequence]] terms, allowing the definition of [[local complete intersection]], or after some [[localization of a ring|localization]] an ideal has defining regular sequences.\n\n==Topology==\n\n=== Homology ===\nSince complete intersections of dimension <math>n</math> in <math>\\mathbb{CP}^{n+m}</math> are the intersection of hyperplane sections, we can use the Lefschetz Hyperplane theorem to deduce that\n:<math>H^{2k}(X) = \\mathbb{Z}</math>\nfor <math>2k < n</math>. In addition, it can be checked that the homology groups are always torsion free using the universal coefficient theorem. This implies that the middle homology group is determined by the euler characteristic of the space.\n\n=== Euler Characteristic===\nHirzebruch gave a generating function computing the dimension of all complete intersections of multi-degree <math>(a_1,\\ldots,a_r)</math>. It reads\n:<math>\n\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\chi(X_n(a_1,\\ldots,a_r))z^n = \\frac{a_1 \\cdots a_r}{(1-z)^2}\\prod_{i=1}^r \\frac{1}{(1 + (a_i - 1)z)}\n</math>\n\n==References==\n*{{citation\n | last = Looijenga | first = E.

Its capital is [[Santa Cruz, Laguna|Santa Cruz]] and the province is situated southeast of [[Metro Manila]], south of the province of [[Rizal province|Rizal]], west of [[Quezon]], north of [[Batangas]] and east of [[Cavite]]. Laguna hugs the southern shores of [[Laguna de Bay]], the largest lake in the country.

It is also famous for attractions like [[Pagsanjan Falls]], the [[University of the Philippines Los Ba\u00f1os]] and the [[University of the Philippines Open University]] in [[Los Ba\u00f1os, Laguna|Los Ba\u00f1os]] , the hot spring resorts of [[Calamba City|Calamba]] on the slopes of [[Mount Makiling]], [[Pila, Laguna|Pila]] historic town plaza, Taytay Falls in [[Majayjay]], the wood carvings and ''[[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]]'' created by the people of [[Paete, Laguna|Paet\u00e9]], the annual ''[[Sampaguita]] Festival'' in [[San Pedro, Laguna|San Pedro]], the ''turumba'' of [[Pakil, Laguna|Pakil]], the ''tsinelas'' footwears from [[Liliw]], the ''Pandan Festival'' of [[Luisiana, Laguna|Luisiana]], the [[Seven Lakes of San Pablo]], and the [[Nagcarlan Underground Cemetery]] in [[Nagcarlan]].\n\n==History==\n===Pre-Hispanic Era===\nThe history of the province of Laguna, and that of the [[CALABARZON|Southern Tagalog]] region, dates as far back as 900 AD. The [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] is the oldest known written document found in the Philippines, which talks of its subject being released from a debt to the King of [[Kingdom of Tondo|Tondo]]. Pre-Hispanic settlement in the area can be dated to prehistoric times, as evidenced in the names of towns such as Pila, Laguna, whose name can be traced to the straight mounds of dirt that form the boundaries of the rice paddy, or ''Pilapil''.\n\nA prominent figure during the time of pre-Hispanic contact is [[Gat Pangil]], a chieftain in the area. The towns of [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]], [[Pangil, Laguna|Pangil]] and [[Pakil, Laguna|Pakil]] were reputed to have once been a part of his domain, although accounts vary on who exactly Gat Pangil was.\n\n===16th Century===\nThe Province of Laguna, which was formerly called ''La Laguna'' and ''La Provincia de la Laguna de Bay'', was named after [[Laguna de Bay]], the body of water that forms its northern boundary.<ref name=\"CalirayaLake\">{{cite web|title=History of Laguna|url=http://www.calirayalake.com/historylaguna.html|website=Calirayalake.com|accessdate=23 June 2016}}</ref> Laguna de Bay, in turn, was named after the town of [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]], the first provincial capital. Captain [[Juan de Salcedo]] with a band of one hundred Spanish-Mexican soldiers conquered the province and its surrounding regions for [[Spain]] in 1571. The province of La Laguna comprised the modern province of Laguna, as well as parts of what is now known as [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]] and [[Quezon (province)|Quezon]].\n\nIn 1577, the [[Franciscan]] [[missionaries]] arrived in [[Manila]], and in 1578 they started evangelizing Laguna, Morong (now [[Rizal]]), [[Tayabas Province|Tayabas]] (now [[Quezon]]) and the [[Bicol Peninsula]]. [[Juan de Plasencia]] and Diego de Oropesa were the earliest Franciscans sent to these places. From 1580, the towns of [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]], Caliraya, [[Majayjay, Laguna|Majayjay]], [[Nagcarlan, Laguna|Nagcarlan]], [[Liliw]], [[Pila, Laguna|Pila]], [[Santa Cruz, Laguna|Santa Cruz]], [[Lumban]], [[Pangil, Laguna|Pangil]] and [[Siniloan]] were founded.

Pagsanj\u00e1n would be the provincial seat until 1858 when it was moved once again to Santa Cruz.

A detachment of British troops under Captain Thomas Backhouse entered the province in search of the silver cargo of the galleon ''Filipina'' while Francisco de San Juan led a band of volunteers that fought them in several engagements in and around the then provincial capital of Pagsanjan. Backhouse plundered the town and burned its newly reconstructed church but San Juan succeeded in escaping with the precious hoard to Pampanga where the treasure greatly bolstered the defense effort of Governor-General [[Sim\u00f3n de Anda y Salazar]]. For his actions, San Juan was made a brigade commander and ''alcalde mayor'' of Tayabas (now [[Quezon]]) province.<ref name=\"HistoryWeebly\" />\n\n===19th Century===\nA major event in Laguna occurred in 1840, when religious intolerance led the people of Majayjay, Nagcarlan, [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]], and [[Bi\u00f1an]] to join the revolt of [[Hermano Pule]] ([[Apolinario de la Cruz]]) of [[Lucban]], Tayabas.<ref name=\"HistoryWeebly\" /> This revolt was eventually crushed by Governor-General [[Marcelino de Ora\u00e1 Lecumberri]].\n\nAs part of political restructuring during the 19th century, the municipalities of [[Morong, Rizal|Morong]], [[Pililla, Rizal|Pililla]], [[Tanay, Rizal|Tanay]], [[Baras, Rizal|Baras]], [[Binangonan]], [[Jalajala]], [[Angono]] and [[Cardona, Rizal|Cardona]] were separated from Laguna and re-organized to the province [[Distrito de Morong|Politico-Militar Distrito de Morong]]. In 1858, the provincial capital was once again moved from Pagsanjan to Santa Cruz, where it stands until today.\n\nIn 1861, [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]] was born in [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]] to Francisco Mercado and Teodora Alonso. Rizal would become one of the leading members of the [[Propaganda Movement]], who advocated political reforms for the colony. Rizal would go on to write two novels, ''[[Noli Me Tangere]]'' and ''[[El Filibusterismo]]'', which in part fueled additional anti-colonial sentiment, contributing to the eventual [[Philippine Revolution]]. In 1896, thousands of inhabitants, especially of Bay, [[Los Ba\u00f1os, Laguna|Los Ba\u00f1os]], [[Nagcarlan]], [[Magdalena, Laguna|Magdalena]], [[Santa Cruz, Laguna|Santa Cruz]], and Pagsanjan had joined the revolutionary [[Katipunan]].<ref name=\"HistoryWeebly\" /> Rizal was executed on December 30, 1896, on charges of rebellion.

Lawton]] fought and won in [[Battle of Santa Cruz (1899)|Santa Cruz]], [[Battle of Pagsanjan|Pagsanjan]], and [[Battle of Paete|Paete]], effectively securing the province for American forces. Resistance still occurred during this time. One of the province's [[folk heroes|folk hero]] during the continuing engagements was Teodoro Asedillo, who was considered a bandit by American forces.\n\nBy the end of the war, the entire country was occupied by American forces and was taken as a colony. The [[Taft Commission]] was established to govern the Philippines during the interim period, which appointed Juan Cailles as the provincial governor of Laguna. Act No. 83, or the Provincial Government Act, established a civilian government under American occupation. During this time, roads were built, schools were established, and in 1917, the [[Manila Railroad Company]] extended its line to Laguna as far as Pagsanjan.\n\nDuring the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]] (1942\u20131945), Laguna was a center of Filipino resistance despite the presence of [[Makapili]] collaborators.<ref name=\"HistoryWeebly\" />\n\nThe establishment of the military general headquarters and military camp bases of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the [[Philippine Constabulary]] is a military unit organization was founded on January 3, 1942 to June 30, 1946 in the province of Laguna, and aided of the local military regular units of the Philippine Commonwealth Army 4th and 42nd Infantry Division and the Philippine Constabulary 4th Constabulary Regiment.

Its capital is [[Santa Cruz, Laguna|Santa Cruz]] and the province is situated southeast of [[Metro Manila]], south of the province of [[Rizal province|Rizal]], west of [[Quezon]], north of [[Batangas]] and east of [[Cavite]]. Laguna hugs the southern shores of [[Laguna de Bay]], the largest lake in the country.

It is also famous for attractions like [[Pagsanjan Falls]], the [[University of the Philippines Los Ba\u00f1os]] and the [[University of the Philippines Open University]] in [[Los Ba\u00f1os, Laguna|Los Ba\u00f1os]] , the hot spring resorts of [[Calamba City|Calamba]] on the slopes of [[Mount Makiling]], [[Pila, Laguna|Pila]] historic town plaza, Taytay Falls in [[Majayjay]], the wood carvings and ''[[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]]'' created by the people of [[Paete, Laguna|Paet\u00e9]], the annual ''[[Sampaguita]] Festival'' in [[San Pedro, Laguna|San Pedro]], the ''turumba'' of [[Pakil, Laguna|Pakil]], the ''tsinelas'' footwears from [[Liliw]], the ''Pandan Festival'' of [[Luisiana, Laguna|Luisiana]], the [[Seven Lakes of San Pablo]], and the [[Nagcarlan Underground Cemetery]] in [[Nagcarlan]].\n\n==History==\n===Pre-Hispanic Era===\nThe history of the province of Laguna, and that of the [[CALABARZON|Southern Tagalog]] region, dates as far back as 900 AD. The [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] is the oldest known written document found in the Philippines, which talks of its subject being released from a debt to the King of [[Kingdom of Tondo|Tondo]]. Pre-Hispanic settlement in the area can be dated to prehistoric times, as evidenced in the names of towns such as Pila, Laguna, whose name can be traced to the straight mounds of dirt that form the boundaries of the rice paddy, or ''Pilapil''.\n\nA prominent figure during the time of pre-Hispanic contact is [[Gat Pangil]], a chieftain in the area. The towns of [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]], [[Pangil, Laguna|Pangil]] and [[Pakil, Laguna|Pakil]] were reputed to have once been a part of his domain, although accounts vary on who exactly Gat Pangil was.\n\n===16th Century===\nThe Province of Laguna, which was formerly called ''La Laguna'' and ''La Provincia de la Laguna de Bay'', was named after [[Laguna de Bay]], the body of water that forms its northern boundary.<ref name=\"CalirayaLake\">{{cite web|title=History of Laguna|url=http://www.calirayalake.com/historylaguna.html|website=Calirayalake.com|accessdate=23 June 2016}}</ref> Laguna de Bay, in turn, was named after the town of [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]], the first provincial capital. Captain [[Juan de Salcedo]] with a band of one hundred Spanish-Mexican soldiers conquered the province and its surrounding regions for [[Spain]] in 1571. The province of La Laguna comprised the modern province of Laguna, as well as parts of what is now known as [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]] and [[Quezon (province)|Quezon]].\n\nIn 1577, the [[Franciscan]] [[missionaries]] arrived in [[Manila]], and in 1578 they started evangelizing Laguna, Morong (now [[Rizal]]), [[Tayabas Province|Tayabas]] (now [[Quezon]]) and the [[Bicol Peninsula]]. [[Juan de Plasencia]] and Diego de Oropesa were the earliest Franciscans sent to these places. From 1580, the towns of [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]], Caliraya, [[Majayjay, Laguna|Majayjay]], [[Nagcarlan, Laguna|Nagcarlan]], [[Liliw]], [[Pila, Laguna|Pila]], [[Santa Cruz, Laguna|Santa Cruz]], [[Lumban]], [[Pangil, Laguna|Pangil]] and [[Siniloan]] were founded.

Pagsanj\u00e1n would be the provincial seat until 1858 when it was moved once again to Santa Cruz.

A detachment of British troops under Captain Thomas Backhouse entered the province in search of the silver cargo of the galleon ''Filipina'' while Francisco de San Juan led a band of volunteers that fought them in several engagements in and around the then provincial capital of Pagsanjan. Backhouse plundered the town and burned its newly reconstructed church but San Juan succeeded in escaping with the precious hoard to Pampanga where the treasure greatly bolstered the defense effort of Governor-General [[Sim\u00f3n de Anda y Salazar]]. For his actions, San Juan was made a brigade commander and ''alcalde mayor'' of Tayabas (now [[Quezon]]) province.<ref name=\"HistoryWeebly\" />\n\n===19th Century===\nA major event in Laguna occurred in 1840, when religious intolerance led the people of Majayjay, Nagcarlan, [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]], and [[Bi\u00f1an]] to join the revolt of [[Hermano Pule]] ([[Apolinario de la Cruz]]) of [[Lucban]], Tayabas.<ref name=\"HistoryWeebly\" /> This revolt was eventually crushed by Governor-General [[Marcelino de Ora\u00e1 Lecumberri]].\n\nAs part of political restructuring during the 19th century, the municipalities of [[Morong, Rizal|Morong]], [[Pililla, Rizal|Pililla]], [[Tanay, Rizal|Tanay]], [[Baras, Rizal|Baras]], [[Binangonan]], [[Jalajala]], [[Angono]] and [[Cardona, Rizal|Cardona]] were separated from Laguna and re-organized to the province [[Distrito de Morong|Politico-Militar Distrito de Morong]]. In 1858, the provincial capital was once again moved from Pagsanjan to Santa Cruz, where it stands until today.\n\nIn 1861, [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]] was born in [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]] to Francisco Mercado and Teodora Alonso. Rizal would become one of the leading members of the [[Propaganda Movement]], who advocated political reforms for the colony. Rizal would go on to write two novels, ''[[Noli Me Tangere]]'' and ''[[El Filibusterismo]]'', which in part fueled additional anti-colonial sentiment, contributing to the eventual [[Philippine Revolution]]. In 1896, thousands of inhabitants, especially of Bay, [[Los Ba\u00f1os, Laguna|Los Ba\u00f1os]], [[Nagcarlan]], [[Magdalena, Laguna|Magdalena]], [[Santa Cruz, Laguna|Santa Cruz]], and Pagsanjan had joined the revolutionary [[Katipunan]].<ref name=\"HistoryWeebly\" /> Rizal was executed on December 30, 1896, on charges of rebellion.

Lawton]] fought and won in [[Battle of Santa Cruz (1899)|Santa Cruz]], [[Battle of Pagsanjan|Pagsanjan]], and [[Battle of Paete|Paete]], effectively securing the province for American forces. Resistance still occurred during this time. One of the province's [[folk heroes|folk hero]] during the continuing engagements was Teodoro Asedillo, who was considered a bandit by American forces.\n\nBy the end of the war, the entire country was occupied by American forces and was taken as a colony. The [[Taft Commission]] was established to govern the Philippines during the interim period, which appointed Juan Cailles as the provincial governor of Laguna. Act No. 83, or the Provincial Government Act, established a civilian government under American occupation. During this time, roads were built, schools were established, and in 1917, the [[Manila Railroad Company]] extended its line to Laguna as far as Pagsanjan.\n\nDuring the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]] (1942\u20131945), Laguna was a center of Filipino resistance despite the presence of [[Makapili]] collaborators.<ref name=\"HistoryWeebly\" />\n\nThe establishment of the military general headquarters and military camp bases of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the [[Philippine Constabulary]] is a military unit organization was founded on January 3, 1942 to June 30, 1946 in the province of Laguna, and aided of the local military regular units of the Philippine Commonwealth Army 4th and 42nd Infantry Division and the Philippine Constabulary 4th Constabulary Regiment.
