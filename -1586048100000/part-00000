Prahlada was even more powerful than his father, Hiranyakashipu ever was. He enjoyed the love and respect of his subjects.\n\nWithout lifting a single weapon, and by virtue of his good behaviour, Prahlada conquered the three worlds easily and [[Indra]] ran away from the Heavens. Indra then deceived Prahlada into giving him the power of his behaviour and Prahlada lost control of the three worlds.\n\nThe Asuras grew angry at the Devas for taking advantage of their King's virtuous behaviour and invaded the heavens. The Devas, afraid of the Asuras, enlisted the help of human Kings such as Yayati, Raji and Kakutstha and defeated them.\n\nPrahlada always served thousands of Brahmins daily. One day, out of ignorance, Prahlada forgot to serve one Brahmin. The latter cursed the Asura that he would forget God Vishnu and become unrighteous. The curse would be broken if God Vishnu defeated Prahlada.\n\nPrahlada then personally attacked the gods and defeated [[Indra]] in battle, forcing the King of the Gods to run for his life. Indra sought help of God [[Vishnu]]. Infused with his power, Indra defeated Prahlada. The latter understood that God Vishnu was helping Indra in battle and he withdrew his forces. Prahlada first gave his kingdom to Andhaka, but the latter was defeated by Shiva. So Prahlada gave it to his son Virochana and undertook a Tirtha Yatra.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nWhen Prahlada found out that his blind and deformed cousin, [[Andhakasura]], had overcome his disabilities and became mighty and invincible due to the boon of Lord [[Brahma]], he voluntarily ceded his lordship over the Asuras to Andhaka and became a vassal. Prahlada, Virochana, Bali and Bana had fought against Lord Shiva and the other gods when Andhaka attacked Mt. Kailash. Prahlada had strongly advised to Andhaka against the invasion, but Andhaka refused. Andhaka was eventually defeated by Lord Shiva and Prahlada once more became King of the Asuras.\n\nPrahlada was present during the churning of the ocean and also fought in the Tarakamaya war against the Devas.\n\nPrahlada's son was Virochana, who was the father of [[Mahabali|Bali]].

Later on, Prahlada and Bali lived on Sutala Loka on instructions of God Vishnu.\n\nIt was Prahlada who asked Shukracharya to acquire the Mritasanjivani mantra from Lord Shiva, to save the Asuras from the Devas.\n\nAfter a long life, Prahlada attained moksha. Prahlada's great grandson was the thousand armed Bana, who was humbled in battle by [[Krishna]].

He enjoyed the love and respect of his subjects.\n\nWithout lifting a single weapon, and by virtue of his good behaviour, Prahlada conquered the three worlds easily and [[Indra]] ran away from the Heavens. Indra then deceived Prahlada into giving him the power of his behaviour and Prahlada lost control of the three worlds.\n\nThe Asuras grew angry at the Devas for taking advantage of their King's virtuous behaviour and invaded the heavens. The Devas, afraid of the Asuras, enlisted the help of human Kings such as Yayati, Raji and Kakutstha and defeated them.\n\nPrahlada always served thousands of Brahmins daily. One day, out of ignorance, Prahlada forgot to serve one Brahmin. The latter cursed the Asura that he would forget God Vishnu and become unrighteous. The curse would be broken if God Vishnu defeated Prahlada.\n\nPrahlada then personally attacked the gods and defeated [[Indra]] in battle, forcing the King of the Gods to run for his life. Indra sought help of God [[Vishnu]]. Infused with his power, Indra defeated Prahlada. The latter understood that God Vishnu was helping Indra in battle and he withdrew his forces. Prahlada first gave his kingdom to Andhaka, but the latter was defeated by Shiva. So Prahlada gave it to his son Virochana and undertook a Tirtha Yatra.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nWhen Prahlada found out that his blind and deformed cousin, [[Andhakasura]], had overcome his disabilities and became mighty and invincible due to the boon of Lord [[Brahma]], he voluntarily ceded his lordship over the Asuras to Andhaka and became a vassal. Prahlada, Virochana, Bali and Bana had fought against Lord Shiva and the other gods when Andhaka attacked Mt. Kailash. Prahlada had strongly advised to Andhaka against the invasion, but Andhaka refused. Andhaka was eventually defeated by Lord Shiva and Prahlada once more became King of the Asuras.\n\nPrahlada was present during the churning of the ocean and also fought in the Tarakamaya war against the Devas.\n\nPrahlada's son was Virochana, who was the father of [[Mahabali|Bali]]. The gods had Virochana killed by taking advantage of his generosity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://btg.krishna.com/lord-vamana-resolves-universal-conflict|title=Lord Vamana Resolves the Universal Conflict|last=|first=|date=|year=2008|website=btg.krishna.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-16|quote=They begged for his crown.

Later on, Prahlada and Bali lived on Sutala Loka on instructions of God Vishnu.\n\nIt was Prahlada who asked Shukracharya to acquire the Mritasanjivani mantra from Lord Shiva, to save the Asuras from the Devas.\n\nAfter a long life, Prahlada attained moksha. Prahlada's great grandson was the thousand armed Bana, who was humbled in battle by [[Krishna]]. Ultimately, as Prahlada is considered a non demonic being within Hinduism.\n\nGod [[Vishnu]] bestowed a boon upon him that in his next life he shall be next 'Manu' and help devotees.\n\n==Pilgrimage sites==\n\nThe following sites in [[Maharashtra]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Telangana]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]] in India, are associated with Prahl\u0101da or Narasi\u1e41ha as places of pilgrimage:\n*Prahlad Ghat, [[Hardoi]]\n*[[Shri Laxmi Narsimha Temple]]\n*[[Malakonda]]\n*[[Simhachalam]]\n*[[Ahobilam]]\n*[[Kadiri]]\n*[[Yadagirigutta Temple]]\n\n==In culture==\nThe '''[[Prahallada Nataka]]''' (also spelled as Prahlada-Na\u1e6daka), a folk dance-theatre from Ganjam, Odisha enacts the story of Narasimha and Hiranyakashipu.

He says, \"few medical men, few solicitors, few persons intended for commerce or trade, ever dreamed of passing through a university career.\" He quotes the Oxford University Commissioners in 1852 stating: \"The education imparted at Oxford was not such as to conduce to the advancement in life of many persons, except those intended for the ministry.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Sir Spencer Walpole|title=History of Twenty-Five Years: vol 4: 1870\u20131875|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dmQ4AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA137|year=1903|pages=136\u201337|access-date=3 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304050530/https://books.google.com/books?id=dmQ4AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA137|archive-date=4 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Nevertheless, Walpole argued: \n{{Quote | style=font-size:100%; | Among the many deficiencies attending a university education there was, however, one good thing about it, and that was the education which the undergraduates gave themselves. It was impossible to collect some thousand or twelve hundred of the best young men in England, to give them the opportunity of making acquaintance with one another, and full liberty to live their lives in their own way, without evolving in the best among them, some admirable qualities of loyalty, independence, and self-control. If the average undergraduate carried from University little or no learning, which was of any service to him, he carried from it a knowledge of men and respect for his fellows and himself, a reverence for the past, a code of honour for the present, which could not but be serviceable. He had enjoyed opportunities... of intercourse with men, some of whom were certain to rise to the highest places in the Senate, in the Church, or at the Bar. He might have mixed with them in his sports, in his studies, and perhaps in his debating society; and any associations which he had this formed had been useful to him at the time, and might be a source of satisfaction to him in after life.<ref>Walpole [https://archive.org/details/cu31924088010115/page/n163 ''History of Twenty-Five Years: vol 3: 1870\u20131875'' p.140]</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nOut of the students who matriculated in 1840, 65% were sons of professionals (34% were Anglican ministers).

[[Science]] students found this particularly burdensome and supported a separate science degree with [[Greek language]] study removed from their required courses. This concept of a [[bachelor of science]] had been adopted at other European universities ([[London University]] had implemented it in 1860) but an 1880 proposal at Oxford to replace the classical requirement with a modern language (like German or French) was unsuccessful. After considerable internal wrangling over the structure of the arts curriculum, in 1886 the \"natural science preliminary\" was recognized as a qualifying part of the first year examination.<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3bDAWHbXgi4C&pg=PA355 The history of the University of Oxford: Nineteenth-century Oxford, Volumes 6\u20137]'', page 355.</ref>\n\nAt the start of 1914 the university housed about 3,000 undergraduates and about 100 postgraduate students.

[[Archibald Campbell Tait]], former headmaster of Rugby School, was a key member of the Oxford Commission; he wanted Oxford to follow the German and Scottish model in which the professorship was paramount. The Commission's report envisioned a centralised university run predominantly by professors and faculties, with a much stronger emphasis on research. The professional staff should be strengthened and better paid. For students, restrictions on entry should be dropped, and more opportunity given to poorer families. It called for an enlargement of the curriculum, with honours to be awarded in many new fields. Undergraduate scholarships should be open to all Britons. Graduate fellowships should be opened up to all members of the university. It recommended that fellows be released from an obligation for ordination. Students were to be allowed to save money by boarding in the city, instead of in a college.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sir Spencer Walpole|title=History of Twenty-Five Years: vol 4: 1870\u20131875|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dmQ4AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA151|year=1903|pages=145\u201351|access-date=4 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305090139/https://books.google.com/books?id=dmQ4AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA151|archive-date=5 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 4127167|title = Oxford and the Idea of a University in Nineteenth Century Britain|journal = Oxford Review of Education|volume = 30|issue = 4|pages = 575\u2013592|last1 = Goldman|first1 = Lawrence|year = 2004}}</ref>\n\nThe system of separate [[Honour Moderations|honour schools]] for different subjects began in 1802, with Mathematics and [[Literae Humaniores]].<ref name=\"boase\"/> Schools of \"Natural Sciences\" and \"Law, and Modern History\" were added in 1853.<ref name=\"boase\">{{cite book |pages=208\u2013209 |last=Boase |first=Charles William |authorlink=Charles William Boase |year=1887 |title=Oxford |edition=2nd |url=http://purl.ox.ac.uk/uuid/743404c6bb6c4b16880e9dfce4000622 |accessdate=3 February 2013}}</ref> By 1872, the last of these had split into \"Jurisprudence\" and \"Modern History\".

Privy Council decisions in the 20th century (e.g. the abolition of compulsory daily worship, dissociation of the Regius Professorship of Hebrew from clerical status, diversion of colleges' theological bequests to other purposes) loosened the link with traditional belief and practice.

The [[Science Area, Oxford|Science Area]], in which most science departments are located, is the area that bears closest resemblance to a campus. The ten-acre (4-hectare) [[Radcliffe Observatory Quarter]] in the northwest of the city is currently under development. However, the larger colleges' sites are of similar size to these areas.\n\nIconic university buildings include the [[Radcliffe Camera]], the [[Sheldonian Theatre]] used for music concerts, lectures, and university ceremonies, and the [[Examination Schools]], where examinations and some lectures take place.

It is open to the public during daylight hours. As well as providing gardens and exotic plants, the Parks contains numerous sports fields, used for official and unofficial fixtures, and also contains sites of special interest including the Genetic Garden, an experimental garden to elucidate and investigate evolutionary processes.\n\nThe [[University of Oxford Botanic Garden|Botanic Garden]] on the [[High Street, Oxford|High Street]] is the oldest [[botanical garden|botanic garden]] in the UK. It contains over 8,000 different plant species on {{convert|1.8|ha|acre|frac=2|abbr=on}}.

The {{convert|1000|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Wytham Woods]] are owned by the university and used for research in [[zoology]] and [[climate change]].\n\nThere are also various collegiate-owned open spaces open to the public, including [[Bagley Wood]] and most notably [[Christ Church Meadow, Oxford|Christ Church Meadow]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/395-732/Biological-Sciences-.html |title=Biological Sciences \u2013 St John's College Oxford |publisher=Sjc.ox.ac.uk |accessdate=16 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018072117/http://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/395-732/Biological-Sciences-.html |archive-date=18 October 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Organisation== <!-- \"s\" spelling per talk page consensus on 20 April 2009 -->\n{{See also|Category:Departments of the University of Oxford}}\nAs a [[collegiate university]], Oxford's structure can be confusing to those unfamiliar with it. The university is a federation, comprising over forty self-governing [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|colleges]] and [[Permanent Private Hall|halls]], along with a central administration headed by the [[List of Vice-Chancellors of the University of Oxford|Vice-Chancellor]].\n\nAcademic departments are located centrally within the structure of the federation; they are not affiliated with any particular college. Departments provide facilities for teaching and research, determine the syllabi and guidelines for the teaching of students, perform research, and deliver lectures and seminars.\n\nColleges arrange the tutorial teaching for their undergraduates, and the members of an academic department are spread around many colleges. Though certain colleges do have subject alignments (e.g., [[Nuffield College]] as a centre for the social sciences), these are exceptions, and most colleges will have a broad mix of academics and students from a diverse range of subjects. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the central university (the [[Bodleian]]), by the departments (individual departmental libraries, such as the English Faculty Library), and by colleges (each of which maintains a multi-discipline library for the use of its members).\n\n===Central governance===\nThe university's formal head is the [[List of Chancellors of the University of Oxford|Chancellor]]{{anchor|Chancellor of the University of Oxford}}, currently [[Chris Patten|Lord Patten of Barnes]], though as at most British universities, the Chancellor is a titular figure and is not involved with the day-to-day running of the university. The Chancellor is elected by the members of [[Convocation]], a body comprising all graduates of the university, and holds office until death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B7kUAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA24#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Oxford University Calendar 1817|date=24 June 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Wellington Square Oxford 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wellington Square, Oxford|Wellington Square]], the name of which has become synonymous with the university's central administration]]\nThe [[List of Vice-Chancellors of the University of Oxford|Vice-Chancellor]], currently [[Louise Richardson]],<ref name=\"VCapproval\"/><ref name=\"NewVCLouiseRichardson\"/> is the ''de facto'' head of the university. Five pro-vice-chancellors have specific responsibilities for education; research; planning and resources; development and external affairs; and personnel and equal opportunities. The University Council is the executive policy-forming body, which consists of the vice-chancellor as well as heads of departments and other members elected by [[Congregation (university)|Congregation]], in addition to observers from the [[OUSU|students' union]]. Congregation, the \"parliament of the dons\", comprises over 3,700 members of the university's academic and administrative staff, and has ultimate responsibility for legislative matters: it discusses and pronounces on policies proposed by the University Council.\n\nTwo university [[Proctor of the University of Oxford|proctors]], elected annually on a rotating basis from two of the colleges, are the internal ombudsmen who make sure that the university and its members adhere to its statutes. This role incorporates student welfare and discipline, as well as oversight of the university's proceedings. The university's professors are collectively referred to as the [[List of professorships at the University of Oxford|Statutory Professors of the University of Oxford]]. They are particularly influential in the running of the university's graduate programmes. Examples of statutory professors are the [[Chichele Professorship]]s and the [[Drummond Professor of Political Economy]]. The various academic faculties, departments, and institutes are organised into four [[Divisions of the University of Oxford|divisions]], each with its own head and elected board. They are the Humanities Division; the Social Sciences Division; the Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences Division; and the Medical Sciences Division.\n\nThe University of Oxford is a \"public university\" in the sense that it receives some public money from the government, but it is a \"private university\" in the sense that it is entirely self-governing and, in theory, could choose to become entirely private by rejecting public funds.<ref name=\"OXCHEPS39\">{{cite web | url = http://oxcheps.new.ox.ac.uk/MainSite%20pages/Resources/OxCHEPS_OP39.pdf | title = OFFA and \u00a36000\u20139000 tuition fees | accessdate = 20 March 2011 | last = Dennis | first = Farrington | first2 = David | last2 = Palfreyman | date = 21 February 2011 | work = OxCHEPS Occasional Paper No. 39 | publisher = Oxford Centre for Higher Education Policy Studies | quote = Note, however, that any university which does not want funding from HEFCE can, as a private corporation, charge whatever tuition fees it likes (exactly as does, say, the University of Buckingham or BPP University College).

For example, some colleges have [[formal hall]] six times a week, but in others this only happens occasionally. At most colleges these formal meals require gowns to be worn, and a Latin grace is said.\n\n''Balls'' are major events held by colleges; the largest, held triennially in 9th week of Trinity Term, are called [[commemoration ball]]s; the dress code is usually [[white tie]]. Many other colleges hold smaller events during the year that they call summer balls or parties. These are usually held on an annual or irregular basis, and are usually [[black tie]].\n\n[[Punt (boat)|Punting]] is a common summer leisure activity.\n\nThere are several more or less quirky traditions peculiar to individual colleges, for example the [[All Souls College, Oxford#Customs|All Souls mallard song]].\n<!-- Ought here to explain Matriculation, make reference to [[May Morning]], and briefly mention Merton's time ceremony, Corpus' tortoise race, etc -->\n\n===Clubs and societies===\n{{See also|Category:Clubs and societies of the University of Oxford}}\n[[File:Eights 2005.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Rowing at Summer Eights, an annual intercollegiate [[bumps race]]]]\nSport is played between college teams, in tournaments known as [[cuppers]] (the term is also used for some non-sporting competitions). In addition to these there are higher standard [[:Category:Oxford student sports clubs|university wide groups]]. Significant focus is given to annual [[Varsity match|varsity]] matches played against Cambridge, the most famous of which is [[The Boat Race]], watched by a TV audience of between five and ten million viewers. This outside interest reflects the importance of rowing to many of those within the university. Much attention is given to the termly intercollegiate rowing regattas: Christ Church Regatta, [[Torpids]] and [[Summer Eights]]. A [[Blue (university sport)|blue]] is an award given to those who compete at the university team level in certain sports. As well as traditional sports, there are teams for activities such as [[Octopush]] and [[Quidditch (sport)|quidditch]].\n\nThere are two weekly student newspapers: the independent ''[[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]]'' and OUSU's ''[[The Oxford Student]]''. Other publications include the [[Isis magazine|''Isis'' magazine]], the satirical ''[[The Oxymoron|Oxymoron]]'', and the graduate ''[[The Oxonian Review of Books|Oxonian Review]]''. The [[Campus radio|student radio]] station is [[Oxide Radio]]. Most colleges have chapel choirs. Music, drama, and other arts societies exist both at collegiate level and as university-wide groups, such as [[Oxford University Dramatic Society]] and the [[Oxford Revue]]. Unlike most other collegiate societies, musical ensembles actively encourage players from other colleges.\n\n[[File:UnionBuildingsDebateChamber.jpg|thumb|The [[Oxford Union]]'s debating chamber]]\nMost academic areas have student societies of some form which are open to students studying all courses, for example the [[Oxford University Scientific Society|Scientific Society]]. There are groups for almost all faiths, political parties, countries and cultures.\n\nThe [[Oxford Union]] (not to be confused with the [[Oxford University Student Union]]) hosts weekly debates and high-profile speakers. There have historically been elite invite-only societies such as the [[Bullingdon Club]].\n\n===Student union and common rooms===\n\nThe [[Oxford University Student Union]], formerly better known by its acronym OUSU and now rebranded as Oxford SU,<ref name=\"OxfordSU\">{{cite news |url=http://cherwell.org/2017/08/17/dnp-ousu-is-dead-long-live-the-oxford-su/ |title=\"Oxford SU\" to replace OUSU brand |work=[[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]] |date=2017-08-17 |accessdate=2018-10-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181026222839/http://cherwell.org/2017/08/17/dnp-ousu-is-dead-long-live-the-oxford-su/ |archive-date=26 October 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> exists to represent students in the university's decision-making, to act as the voice for students in the national higher education policy debate, and to provide direct services to the student body. Reflecting the collegiate nature of the University of Oxford itself, OUSU is both an association of Oxford's more than 21,000 individual students and a federation of the affiliated college common rooms, and other affiliated organisations that represent subsets of the undergraduate and graduate students. The OUSU Executive Committee includes six full-time salaried sabbatical officers, who generally serve in the year following completion of their Final Examinations.\n\nThe importance of collegiate life is such that for many students their college JCR (Junior Common Room, for undergraduates) or MCR (Middle Common Room, for graduates) is seen as more important than OUSU. JCRs and MCRs each have a committee, with a president and other elected students representing their peers to college authorities. Additionally, they organise events and often have significant budgets to spend as they wish (money coming from their colleges and sometimes other sources such as student-run bars). (It is worth noting that JCR and MCR are terms that are used to refer to rooms for use by members, as well as the student bodies.) Not all colleges use this JCR/MCR structure, for example [[Wadham College]]'s entire student population is represented by a combined Students' Union and purely graduate colleges have different arrangements.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{Main|List of University of Oxford people}}\nThroughout its history, a sizeable number of Oxford alumni, known as Oxonians, have become notable in many varied fields, both academic and otherwise. A total of [[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation|69 Nobel prize-winners]] have studied or taught at Oxford, with prizes won in all six categories.<ref name=\"Famous\"/>\nMore information on notable members of the university can be found in the [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|individual college]] articles.

He says, \"few medical men, few solicitors, few persons intended for commerce or trade, ever dreamed of passing through a university career.\" He quotes the Oxford University Commissioners in 1852 stating: \"The education imparted at Oxford was not such as to conduce to the advancement in life of many persons, except those intended for the ministry.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Sir Spencer Walpole|title=History of Twenty-Five Years: vol 4: 1870\u20131875|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dmQ4AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA137|year=1903|pages=136\u201337|access-date=3 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304050530/https://books.google.com/books?id=dmQ4AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA137|archive-date=4 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Nevertheless, Walpole argued: \n{{Quote | style=font-size:100%; | Among the many deficiencies attending a university education there was, however, one good thing about it, and that was the education which the undergraduates gave themselves. It was impossible to collect some thousand or twelve hundred of the best young men in England, to give them the opportunity of making acquaintance with one another, and full liberty to live their lives in their own way, without evolving in the best among them, some admirable qualities of loyalty, independence, and self-control. If the average undergraduate carried from University little or no learning, which was of any service to him, he carried from it a knowledge of men and respect for his fellows and himself, a reverence for the past, a code of honour for the present, which could not but be serviceable. He had enjoyed opportunities... of intercourse with men, some of whom were certain to rise to the highest places in the Senate, in the Church, or at the Bar. He might have mixed with them in his sports, in his studies, and perhaps in his debating society; and any associations which he had this formed had been useful to him at the time, and might be a source of satisfaction to him in after life.<ref>Walpole [https://archive.org/details/cu31924088010115/page/n163 ''History of Twenty-Five Years: vol 3: 1870\u20131875'' p.140]</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nOut of the students who matriculated in 1840, 65% were sons of professionals (34% were Anglican ministers).

[[Science]] students found this particularly burdensome and supported a separate science degree with [[Greek language]] study removed from their required courses. This concept of a [[bachelor of science]] had been adopted at other European universities ([[London University]] had implemented it in 1860) but an 1880 proposal at Oxford to replace the classical requirement with a modern language (like German or French) was unsuccessful. After considerable internal wrangling over the structure of the arts curriculum, in 1886 the \"natural science preliminary\" was recognized as a qualifying part of the first year examination.<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3bDAWHbXgi4C&pg=PA355 The history of the University of Oxford: Nineteenth-century Oxford, Volumes 6\u20137]'', page 355.</ref>\n\nAt the start of 1914 the university housed about 3,000 undergraduates and about 100 postgraduate students.

[[Archibald Campbell Tait]], former headmaster of Rugby School, was a key member of the Oxford Commission; he wanted Oxford to follow the German and Scottish model in which the professorship was paramount. The Commission's report envisioned a centralised university run predominantly by professors and faculties, with a much stronger emphasis on research. The professional staff should be strengthened and better paid. For students, restrictions on entry should be dropped, and more opportunity given to poorer families. It called for an enlargement of the curriculum, with honours to be awarded in many new fields. Undergraduate scholarships should be open to all Britons. Graduate fellowships should be opened up to all members of the university. It recommended that fellows be released from an obligation for ordination. Students were to be allowed to save money by boarding in the city, instead of in a college.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sir Spencer Walpole|title=History of Twenty-Five Years: vol 4: 1870\u20131875|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dmQ4AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA151|year=1903|pages=145\u201351|access-date=4 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305090139/https://books.google.com/books?id=dmQ4AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA151|archive-date=5 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 4127167|title = Oxford and the Idea of a University in Nineteenth Century Britain|journal = Oxford Review of Education|volume = 30|issue = 4|pages = 575\u2013592|last1 = Goldman|first1 = Lawrence|year = 2004}}</ref>\n\nThe system of separate [[Honour Moderations|honour schools]] for different subjects began in 1802, with Mathematics and [[Literae Humaniores]].<ref name=\"boase\"/> Schools of \"Natural Sciences\" and \"Law, and Modern History\" were added in 1853.<ref name=\"boase\">{{cite book |pages=208\u2013209 |last=Boase |first=Charles William |authorlink=Charles William Boase |year=1887 |title=Oxford |edition=2nd |url=http://purl.ox.ac.uk/uuid/743404c6bb6c4b16880e9dfce4000622 |accessdate=3 February 2013}}</ref> By 1872, the last of these had split into \"Jurisprudence\" and \"Modern History\".

Privy Council decisions in the 20th century (e.g. the abolition of compulsory daily worship, dissociation of the Regius Professorship of Hebrew from clerical status, diversion of colleges' theological bequests to other purposes) loosened the link with traditional belief and practice.

The [[Science Area, Oxford|Science Area]], in which most science departments are located, is the area that bears closest resemblance to a campus. The ten-acre (4-hectare) [[Radcliffe Observatory Quarter]] in the northwest of the city is currently under development. However, the larger colleges' sites are of similar size to these areas.\n\nIconic university buildings include the [[Radcliffe Camera]], the [[Sheldonian Theatre]] used for music concerts, lectures, and university ceremonies, and the [[Examination Schools]], where examinations and some lectures take place.

It is open to the public during daylight hours. As well as providing gardens and exotic plants, the Parks contains numerous sports fields, used for official and unofficial fixtures, and also contains sites of special interest including the Genetic Garden, an experimental garden to elucidate and investigate evolutionary processes.\n\nThe [[University of Oxford Botanic Garden|Botanic Garden]] on the [[High Street, Oxford|High Street]] is the oldest [[botanical garden|botanic garden]] in the UK. It contains over 8,000 different plant species on {{convert|1.8|ha|acre|frac=2|abbr=on}}.

The {{convert|1000|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Wytham Woods]] are owned by the university and used for research in [[zoology]] and [[climate change]].\n\nThere are also various collegiate-owned open spaces open to the public, including [[Bagley Wood]] and most notably [[Christ Church Meadow, Oxford|Christ Church Meadow]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/395-732/Biological-Sciences-.html |title=Biological Sciences \u2013 St John's College Oxford |publisher=Sjc.ox.ac.uk |accessdate=16 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018072117/http://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/395-732/Biological-Sciences-.html |archive-date=18 October 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Organisation== <!-- \"s\" spelling per talk page consensus on 20 April 2009 -->\n{{See also|Category:Departments of the University of Oxford}}\nAs a [[collegiate university]], Oxford's structure can be confusing to those unfamiliar with it. The university is a federation, comprising over forty self-governing [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|colleges]] and [[Permanent Private Hall|halls]], along with a central administration headed by the [[List of Vice-Chancellors of the University of Oxford|Vice-Chancellor]].\n\nAcademic departments are located centrally within the structure of the federation; they are not affiliated with any particular college. Departments provide facilities for teaching and research, determine the syllabi and guidelines for the teaching of students, perform research, and deliver lectures and seminars.\n\nColleges arrange the tutorial teaching for their undergraduates, and the members of an academic department are spread around many colleges. Though certain colleges do have subject alignments (e.g., [[Nuffield College]] as a centre for the social sciences), these are exceptions, and most colleges will have a broad mix of academics and students from a diverse range of subjects. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the central university (the [[Bodleian]]), by the departments (individual departmental libraries, such as the English Faculty Library), and by colleges (each of which maintains a multi-discipline library for the use of its members).\n\n===Central governance===\nThe university's formal head is the [[List of Chancellors of the University of Oxford|Chancellor]]{{anchor|Chancellor of the University of Oxford}}, currently [[Chris Patten|Lord Patten of Barnes]], though as at most British universities, the Chancellor is a titular figure and is not involved with the day-to-day running of the university. The Chancellor is elected by the members of [[Convocation]], a body comprising all graduates of the university, and holds office until death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B7kUAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA24#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Oxford University Calendar 1817|date=24 June 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Wellington Square Oxford 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wellington Square, Oxford|Wellington Square]], the name of which has become synonymous with the university's central administration]]\nThe [[List of Vice-Chancellors of the University of Oxford|Vice-Chancellor]], currently [[Louise Richardson]],<ref name=\"VCapproval\"/><ref name=\"NewVCLouiseRichardson\"/> is the ''de facto'' head of the university. Five pro-vice-chancellors have specific responsibilities for education; research; planning and resources; development and external affairs; and personnel and equal opportunities. The University Council is the executive policy-forming body, which consists of the vice-chancellor as well as heads of departments and other members elected by [[Congregation (university)|Congregation]], in addition to observers from the [[OUSU|students' union]]. Congregation, the \"parliament of the dons\", comprises over 3,700 members of the university's academic and administrative staff, and has ultimate responsibility for legislative matters: it discusses and pronounces on policies proposed by the University Council.\n\nTwo university [[Proctor of the University of Oxford|proctors]], elected annually on a rotating basis from two of the colleges, are the internal ombudsmen who make sure that the university and its members adhere to its statutes. This role incorporates student welfare and discipline, as well as oversight of the university's proceedings. The university's professors are collectively referred to as the [[List of professorships at the University of Oxford|Statutory Professors of the University of Oxford]]. They are particularly influential in the running of the university's graduate programmes. Examples of statutory professors are the [[Chichele Professorship]]s and the [[Drummond Professor of Political Economy]]. The various academic faculties, departments, and institutes are organised into four [[Divisions of the University of Oxford|divisions]], each with its own head and elected board. They are the Humanities Division; the Social Sciences Division; the Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences Division; and the Medical Sciences Division.\n\nThe University of Oxford is a \"public university\" in the sense that it receives some public money from the government, but it is a \"private university\" in the sense that it is entirely self-governing and, in theory, could choose to become entirely private by rejecting public funds.<ref name=\"OXCHEPS39\">{{cite web | url = http://oxcheps.new.ox.ac.uk/MainSite%20pages/Resources/OxCHEPS_OP39.pdf | title = OFFA and \u00a36000\u20139000 tuition fees | accessdate = 20 March 2011 | last = Dennis | first = Farrington | first2 = David | last2 = Palfreyman | date = 21 February 2011 | work = OxCHEPS Occasional Paper No. 39 | publisher = Oxford Centre for Higher Education Policy Studies | quote = Note, however, that any university which does not want funding from HEFCE can, as a private corporation, charge whatever tuition fees it likes (exactly as does, say, the University of Buckingham or BPP University College).

For example, some colleges have [[formal hall]] six times a week, but in others this only happens occasionally. At most colleges these formal meals require gowns to be worn, and a Latin grace is said.\n\n''Balls'' are major events held by colleges; the largest, held triennially in 9th week of Trinity Term, are called [[commemoration ball]]s; the dress code is usually [[white tie]]. Many other colleges hold smaller events during the year that they call summer balls or parties. These are usually held on an annual or irregular basis, and are usually [[black tie]].\n\n[[Punt (boat)|Punting]] is a common summer leisure activity.\n\nThere are several more or less quirky traditions peculiar to individual colleges, for example the [[All Souls College, Oxford#Customs|All Souls mallard song]].\n<!-- Ought here to explain Matriculation, make reference to [[May Morning]], and briefly mention Merton's time ceremony, Corpus' tortoise race, etc -->\n\n===Clubs and societies===\n{{See also|Category:Clubs and societies of the University of Oxford}}\n[[File:Eights 2005.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Rowing at Summer Eights, an annual intercollegiate [[bumps race]]]]\nSport is played between college teams, in tournaments known as [[cuppers]] (the term is also used for some non-sporting competitions). In addition to these there are higher standard [[:Category:Oxford student sports clubs|university wide groups]]. Significant focus is given to annual [[Varsity match|varsity]] matches played against Cambridge, the most famous of which is [[The Boat Race]], watched by a TV audience of between five and ten million viewers. This outside interest reflects the importance of rowing to many of those within the university. Much attention is given to the termly intercollegiate rowing regattas: Christ Church Regatta, [[Torpids]] and [[Summer Eights]]. A [[Blue (university sport)|blue]] is an award given to those who compete at the university team level in certain sports. As well as traditional sports, there are teams for activities such as [[Octopush]] and [[Quidditch (sport)|quidditch]].\n\nThere are two weekly student newspapers: the independent ''[[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]]'' and OUSU's ''[[The Oxford Student]]''. Other publications include the [[Isis magazine|''Isis'' magazine]], the satirical ''[[The Oxymoron|Oxymoron]]'', and the graduate ''[[The Oxonian Review of Books|Oxonian Review]]''. The [[Campus radio|student radio]] station is [[Oxide Radio]]. Most colleges have chapel choirs. Music, drama, and other arts societies exist both at collegiate level and as university-wide groups, such as [[Oxford University Dramatic Society]] and the [[Oxford Revue]]. Unlike most other collegiate societies, musical ensembles actively encourage players from other colleges.\n\n[[File:UnionBuildingsDebateChamber.jpg|thumb|The [[Oxford Union]]'s debating chamber]]\nMost academic areas have student societies of some form which are open to students studying all courses, for example the [[Oxford University Scientific Society|Scientific Society]]. There are groups for almost all faiths, political parties, countries and cultures.\n\nThe [[Oxford Union]] (not to be confused with the [[Oxford University Student Union]]) hosts weekly debates and high-profile speakers. There have historically been elite invite-only societies such as the [[Bullingdon Club]].\n\n===Student union and common rooms===\n\nThe [[Oxford University Student Union]], formerly better known by its acronym OUSU and now rebranded as Oxford SU,<ref name=\"OxfordSU\">{{cite news |url=http://cherwell.org/2017/08/17/dnp-ousu-is-dead-long-live-the-oxford-su/ |title=\"Oxford SU\" to replace OUSU brand |work=[[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]] |date=2017-08-17 |accessdate=2018-10-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181026222839/http://cherwell.org/2017/08/17/dnp-ousu-is-dead-long-live-the-oxford-su/ |archive-date=26 October 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> exists to represent students in the university's decision-making, to act as the voice for students in the national higher education policy debate, and to provide direct services to the student body. Reflecting the collegiate nature of the University of Oxford itself, OUSU is both an association of Oxford's more than 21,000 individual students and a federation of the affiliated college common rooms, and other affiliated organisations that represent subsets of the undergraduate and graduate students. The OUSU Executive Committee includes six full-time salaried sabbatical officers, who generally serve in the year following completion of their Final Examinations.\n\nThe importance of collegiate life is such that for many students their college JCR (Junior Common Room, for undergraduates) or MCR (Middle Common Room, for graduates) is seen as more important than OUSU. JCRs and MCRs each have a committee, with a president and other elected students representing their peers to college authorities. Additionally, they organise events and often have significant budgets to spend as they wish (money coming from their colleges and sometimes other sources such as student-run bars). (It is worth noting that JCR and MCR are terms that are used to refer to rooms for use by members, as well as the student bodies.) Not all colleges use this JCR/MCR structure, for example [[Wadham College]]'s entire student population is represented by a combined Students' Union and purely graduate colleges have different arrangements.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{Main|List of University of Oxford people}}\nThroughout its history, a sizeable number of Oxford alumni, known as Oxonians, have become notable in many varied fields, both academic and otherwise. A total of [[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation|69 Nobel prize-winners]] have studied or taught at Oxford, with prizes won in all six categories.<ref name=\"Famous\"/>\nMore information on notable members of the university can be found in the [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|individual college]] articles.
