There he met a boy who said that if Heracles slew the Nemean lion and returned alive within 30 days, the town would sacrifice a lion to Zeus; but if he did not return within 30 days or he died, the boy would sacrifice himself to Zeus.<ref name=\"Apollod 2.5.1\"/> Another version claims that he met Molorchos, a shepherd who had lost his son to the lion, saying that if he came back within 30 days, a ram would be sacrificed to [[Zeus]]. If he did not return within 30 days, it would be sacrificed to the dead Heracles as a mourning offering.\n\nWhile searching for the lion, Heracles fetched some arrows to use against it, not knowing that its golden fur was impenetrable; when he found the lion and shot at it with his bow, he discovered the fur's protective property when the arrow bounced harmlessly off the creature's thigh. After some time, Heracles made the lion return to his cave. The cave had two entrances, one of which Heracles blocked; he then entered the other. In those dark and close quarters, Heracles stunned the beast with his club. During the fight, the lion bit off one of his fingers. He eventually killed the lion by strangling it with his bare hands.\n\nAfter slaying the lion, he tried to skin it with a knife from his belt, but failed. He then tried sharpening the knife with a stone and even tried with the stone itself. Finally, [[Athena]], noticing the hero's plight, told Heracles to use one of the lion's own claws to skin the pelt.\n\nWhen he returned on the thirtieth day, carrying the carcass of the lion on his shoulders, King Eurystheus was amazed and terrified. Eurystheus forbade him ever again to enter the city; in the future, he was to display the fruits of his labours outside the city gates. Eurystheus warned him that the tasks set for him would become increasingly difficult. He then sent Heracles off to complete his next quest, which was to destroy the [[Lernaean hydra]].\n\nHeracles wore the Nemean lion's coat after killing it, as it was impervious to the elements and all but the most powerful weapons. Others say that Heracles' armour was, in fact, the hide of the lion of [[Cithaeron]].\n\nAccording to [[Alexander of Myndus]], Heracles was helped in this labour by an [[Gaia (mythology)|Earth]]-born [[Dragons in Greek mythology|serpent]], which followed him to [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and settled down in [[Aulis (ancient Greece)|Aulis]]. It was later identified as the water snake which devoured the sparrows and was turned into stone in the prophecy about the [[Trojan War]].<ref>Daniel Ogden, ''Drakon: Dragon Myth and Serpent Cult in the Greek and Roman Worlds''</ref>\n\n==In art==\n<gallery>\nFile:Herakles Nemean lion BM B621.jpg|[[Oinochoe]], 520\u2013500 BC, from [[Vulci]]\nFile:Met, gandhara, hercules and the nemean lion, 1st century.JPG|[[Gandhara]], India, 1st century\nFile:Mathura statue of Herakles strangling the Nemaean lion.jpg|[[Mathura Herakles|Herakles fighting the Nemean lion]], [[Mathura art]], India.<ref>http://www2.nau.edu/~d-ctel/hum/hum362/slideshows/Kushan_Mathura/images/img0073.jpg</ref>\nFile:Antalya Museum - Sarkophag 3 Herkules und Nem\u00e4ischer L\u00f6we.jpg|[[Roman Empire|Roman-era]] [[relief sculpture|relief]], 2nd century\nFile:Il moderno, ercole con il leone neemeo, 1488-89.JPG|[[Renaissance]] plaque by Galeazzo Mondella\nFile:H\u00e9rcules lucha con el le\u00f3n de Nemea, por Zurbar\u00e1n.jpg|Painting by [[Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n]] (1634)\nFile:Lucha de Heracles con el le\u00f3n de Nemea.jpg|Marble by [[:es:Jos\u00e9 Manuel F\u00e9lix Magdalena|J.M.

It was eventually killed by [[Heracles]]. It could not be killed with mortals' weapons because its golden fur was impervious to attack. Its claws were sharper than mortals' swords and could cut through any armor.\n\nToday, [[lion]]s are not part of the [[List of mammals of Greece|Greek fauna]]. The [[Asiatic lion]] subspecies formerly ranged in southeastern Europe. According to [[Herodotus]], lion populations were extant in [[Ancient Greece]]. George Schaller asserts that they may have been present in the area until circa. 100 BC.<ref>{{cite book |last=Schaller |first=George B. |authorlink=George Schaller|year=1972 |title= The Serengeti lion: A study of predator\u2013prey relations|publisher= University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago |isbn=0226736393}}</ref>\n\n==Origin==\nThe origins of the Nemean lion differ on the sources.

There he met a boy who said that if Heracles slew the Nemean lion and returned alive within 30 days, the town would sacrifice a lion to Zeus; but if he did not return within 30 days or he died, the boy would sacrifice himself to Zeus.<ref name=\"Apollod 2.5.1\"/> Another version claims that he met Molorchos, a shepherd who had lost his son to the lion, saying that if he came back within 30 days, a ram would be sacrificed to [[Zeus]]. If he did not return within 30 days, it would be sacrificed to the dead Heracles as a mourning offering.\n\nWhile searching for the lion, Heracles fetched some arrows to use against it, not knowing that its golden fur was impenetrable; when he found the lion and shot at it with his bow, he discovered the fur's protective property when the arrow bounced harmlessly off the creature's thigh. After some time, Heracles made the lion return to his cave. The cave had two entrances, one of which Heracles blocked; he then entered the other. In those dark and close quarters, Heracles stunned the beast with his club. During the fight, the lion bit off one of his fingers. He eventually killed the lion by strangling it with his bare hands.\n\nAfter slaying the lion, he tried to skin it with a knife from his belt, but failed. He then tried sharpening the knife with a stone and even tried with the stone itself. Finally, [[Athena]], noticing the hero's plight, told Heracles to use one of the lion's own claws to skin the pelt.\n\nWhen he returned on the thirtieth day, carrying the carcass of the lion on his shoulders, King Eurystheus was amazed and terrified. Eurystheus forbade him ever again to enter the city; in the future, he was to display the fruits of his labours outside the city gates. Eurystheus warned him that the tasks set for him would become increasingly difficult. He then sent Heracles off to complete his next quest, which was to destroy the [[Lernaean hydra]].\n\nHeracles wore the Nemean lion's coat after killing it, as it was impervious to the elements and all but the most powerful weapons. Others say that Heracles' armour was, in fact, the hide of the lion of [[Cithaeron]].\n\nAccording to [[Alexander of Myndus]], Heracles was helped in this labour by an [[Gaia (mythology)|Earth]]-born [[Dragons in Greek mythology|serpent]], which followed him to [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and settled down in [[Aulis (ancient Greece)|Aulis]]. It was later identified as the water snake which devoured the sparrows and was turned into stone in the prophecy about the [[Trojan War]].<ref>Daniel Ogden, ''Drakon: Dragon Myth and Serpent Cult in the Greek and Roman Worlds''</ref>\n\n==In art==\n<gallery>\nFile:Herakles Nemean lion BM B621.jpg|[[Oinochoe]], 520\u2013500 BC, from [[Vulci]]\nFile:Met, gandhara, hercules and the nemean lion, 1st century.JPG|[[Gandhara]], India, 1st century\nFile:Mathura statue of Herakles strangling the Nemaean lion.jpg|[[Mathura Herakles|Herakles fighting the Nemean lion]], [[Mathura art]], India.<ref>http://www2.nau.edu/~d-ctel/hum/hum362/slideshows/Kushan_Mathura/images/img0073.jpg</ref>\nFile:Antalya Museum - Sarkophag 3 Herkules und Nem\u00e4ischer L\u00f6we.jpg|[[Roman Empire|Roman-era]] [[relief sculpture|relief]], 2nd century\nFile:Il moderno, ercole con il leone neemeo, 1488-89.JPG|[[Renaissance]] plaque by Galeazzo Mondella\nFile:H\u00e9rcules lucha con el le\u00f3n de Nemea, por Zurbar\u00e1n.jpg|Painting by [[Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n]] (1634)\nFile:Lucha de Heracles con el le\u00f3n de Nemea.jpg|Marble by [[:es:Jos\u00e9 Manuel F\u00e9lix Magdalena|J.M.
