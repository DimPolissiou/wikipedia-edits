They also formed a friendship, which led to a bond they would never forget. Going through several orphanages in [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]] and seeing thousands of Vietnam street children, Dubeck changed his view and idea about the world and felt sympathetic towards the children, even though they were not his son. This experience also caused him to befriend a women named Margeret Sheen ([[Rita Tushingham]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ritatushingham.com/1970.htm|title=The Rita Tushingham Home Page - Credits & Photos 1970 - 1979|website=ritatushingham.com|access-date=2016-06-17}}</ref> who worked for an orphanage.\n\nEventually, after he found that his son with Em Thug was dead, and Em Thug already moved on and had a baby with another American pilot, he decided to go back to the U.S. alone. At the last moment, he realized whom he really regarded as his son \u2013 Trung \u2013 and took Trung back to the US with him.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* {{IMDb title|0074590}}\n\n\n[[Category:1977 television films]]\n[[Category:American television films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:Peabody Award-winning broadcasts]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Erman]]\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Eyes_(1977_film)"}

The airline began operating commercial aircraft in 1983 under the name [[Channel Express]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dartgroup.co.uk|title=Welcome - Dart Group plc|work=dartgroup.co.uk}}</ref> when it was purchased by the Dart Group's current Executive Chairman, Philip Meeson. Initially a freight operator, from 2001 the airline also began operating passenger charter services using [[Boeing]] aircraft to international destinations on mainly short and medium-haul routes.\n\n===Formative years===\n[[File:Jet2 737 Leeds Bradford Airport.jpg|thumb|A Jet2.com [[Boeing 737-300]] in the former livery|alt=]]\nIn 2002, [[Channel Express]] established the Jet2.com brand from [[Leeds Bradford International Airport]]. The re-branded Jet2.com began operating as a leisure airline with its first flight from Leeds Bradford to Amsterdam on 12 February 2003, which operated a twice daily rotation with two [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]] aircraft. During 2003, further scheduled flights were launched to seven European sun and city break destinations.\n\nIn 2004, a second base was opened at [[Manchester Airport]] with the airline operating from Terminal 1. The airline also acquired further Boeing 737 and 757 aircraft and opened a base at [[Belfast International Airport]].\n\nIn 2005, Jet2.com opened a third base at [[Newcastle International Airport|Newcastle]]. Later in the year, the company acquired two [[Boeing 757|Boeing 757-200]] aircraft, enabling it to fly medium-long haul destinations as well as carrying more passengers on popular existing routes. These aircraft helped the company to open two more bases at [[Blackpool Airport|Blackpool]] and [[Edinburgh Airport|Edinburgh]].\n\nIn 2006 the company relocated from [[Bournemouth]] to [[Leeds]] and was renamed Jet2.com Limited.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/b5eb00126cd2a251a7e4256abf67587c/compdetails |title=Companies House - English Company 02739537 |publisher=Wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=26 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Expansion ===\nIn November 2008 Jet2.com changed its slogan from \"The North's Low Cost Airline\" to \"Friendly Low Fares\".

The airline began operating commercial aircraft in 1983 under the name [[Channel Express]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dartgroup.co.uk|title=Welcome - Dart Group plc|work=dartgroup.co.uk}}</ref> when it was purchased by the Dart Group's current Executive Chairman, Philip Meeson. Initially a freight operator, from 2001 the airline also began operating passenger charter services using [[Boeing]] aircraft to international destinations on mainly short and medium-haul routes.\n\n===Formative years===\n[[File:Jet2 737 Leeds Bradford Airport.jpg|thumb|A Jet2.com [[Boeing 737-300]] in the former livery|alt=]]\nIn 2002, [[Channel Express]] established the Jet2.com brand from [[Leeds Bradford International Airport]]. The re-branded Jet2.com began operating as a leisure airline with its first flight from Leeds Bradford to Amsterdam on 12 February 2003, which operated a twice daily rotation with two [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]] aircraft. During 2003, further scheduled flights were launched to seven European sun and city break destinations.\n\nIn 2004, a second base was opened at [[Manchester Airport]] with the airline operating from Terminal 1. The airline also acquired further Boeing 737 and 757 aircraft and opened a base at [[Belfast International Airport]].\n\nIn 2005, Jet2.com opened a third base at [[Newcastle International Airport|Newcastle]]. Later in the year, the company acquired two [[Boeing 757|Boeing 757-200]] aircraft, enabling it to fly medium-long haul destinations as well as carrying more passengers on popular existing routes. These aircraft helped the company to open two more bases at [[Blackpool Airport|Blackpool]] and [[Edinburgh Airport|Edinburgh]].\n\nIn 2006 the company relocated from [[Bournemouth]] to [[Leeds]] and was renamed Jet2.com Limited.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/b5eb00126cd2a251a7e4256abf67587c/compdetails |title=Companies House - English Company 02739537 |publisher=Wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=26 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Expansion ===\nIn November 2008 Jet2.com changed its slogan from \"The North's Low Cost Airline\" to \"Friendly Low Fares\". This preceded the announcement of opening a hub at [[East Midlands Airport]], the first of the airline's outside the North of England and Scotland.

Pilgrimage to these meccas declined after the [[Edo period]]. But recently, the [[Shikoku Pilgrimage]] of the eighty-eight temple sites (commonly known as ''ohenro-san'') has become fashionable.

(c. 1840s, School of [[Hokusai]])]]\n\nAs in most developed nations, it is increasingly difficult to find living storytellers of oral tradition. But there is a wealth of folktales collected through the ages. The name ''mukashi-banashi'' (tales of \"long ago\" or from \"bygone times\") has been applied to the common folktale, since they typically open with the formula \"Mukashi...\"<ref name=heibonsha-mukashi>{{Harvnb|Heibonsha|1964}} encyclopedia, vol.21, p.499-502, \"mukashibanashi\", by Katsumi Masuda</ref> (akin to \"Once upon a time...\"). They also close with some set phrase like \"''dotto harai''\"<ref name=heibonsha-mukashi/> (a variant form being [[Dondo Hare]]).\n\nThese tales had been told in their local dialects, which may be difficult to understand to outsiders, both because of intonation and pronunciation differences, conjugations, and vocabulary. Many folktales collected from the field are actually \"translations\" into standard Japanese (or more like adaptations, merging several collected versions).\n\n===Classic folktales===\nClassic folktales such as ''[[Momotar\u014d]]'', which most Japanese today are familiarized through pictured children's storybooks, manga, or other popularizations, can be traced to [[E-hon|picture-books]] printed in the [[Edo period]], though their prototypical stories may go back much further. The versions retold by children's story author ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Sazanami Iwaya|ja|3=\u5dcc\u8c37\u5c0f\u6ce2|vertical-align=sup}}'' (1870\u20131933)<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Kinoshita|first=Junji|title=''Hy\u014dronshu'' (collected criticisms 1956~1957)|volume=4|publisher=Miraisha(\u672a\u6765\u793e)|year=1974|format=snippet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ubk1AQAAIAAJ}}, p.82, quote:\"\u76f4\u63a5\u6c11\u8846\u306e\u8a9e\u308b\u7269\u8a9e\u304b\u3089\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f)\u5dcc\u8c37\u5c0f\u6ce2\u304c\u5b9a\u578b\u5316\u3057\u3001\u305d\u308c\u304c\u56fd\u5b9a \u6559\u79d1\u66f8\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u5e83\u304f\u666e\u53ca\u3055\u308c\u305f\u305d\u3046\u3044\u3046\u6843\u592a\u90ce\u306e\u8a71\"</ref> had a strong hand in establishing the forms usually known today.\n\n===Animals in folktales===\nTwo creatures are particularly known for their abilities to transform into humans or other beings and objects, the ''[[kitsune]]'' (fox) and ''[[bake-danuki|tanuki]]'' (the [[Japanese raccoon dog]]; pictured). They occur frequently in folktales of humorous nature.\n\nMarriages between humans and non-humans ({{Nihongo|''irui konin tan''|[[:ja:\u7570\u985e\u5a5a\u59fb\u8b5a|\u7570\u985e\u5a5a\u59fb\u8b5a]]|\"tales of heterotype marriages\"}}) comprise a major category or motif in Japanese folklore. Japanese heterotype examples such as the crane story describes a sustained period of married life between the interspecies couple, in contrast to Western examples like [[The Frog Prince (story)|Frog Prince]] or the [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]] myth where the supernatural encounter is brief. An unusual pairing occurs in the story of the {{Nihongo|''{{Interlanguage link multi|Hamaguri ny\u014dbo|ja|3=\u86e4\u5973\u623f|vertical-align=sup}}''|\u86e4\u5973\u623f|\"clam wife\"}}, which exist in both a politer written version (''[[otogi-z\u014dshi]]'') and in a more rustic and vulgar oral tale. The gender is reversed in the tale of ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Tanishi ch\u014dja|ja|3=\u7530\u87ba\u9577\u8005|vertical-align=sup}}'' where a bride is wedded to a tiny ''tanishi'' ([[river snail]]).\n\n===Modern renditions===\nA number of folktales were adapted for stage performance by playwright [[Junji Kinoshita]], notably ''Y\u016bzuru'' (''[[Twilight Crane]]'', 1949),<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Keene|first=Donald|title=Dawn to the West: Japanese Literature of the Modern Era|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1999|format=preview|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kw7q73qBIMoC&pg=PA482|isbn= 978-0-231-11439-4}}, p.482-3</ref> based on the folktale ''[[Tsuru no Ongaeshi]]'' or \"a crane who repaid its gratitude\".\n\nIn the [[American television series]] called ''[[The Yokai King]]'', starring by [[Shin Koyamada]], the characters are based on the Japanese folklore creatures.\n\n===Fantastic creatures===\n{{About||monsters and ghostly creatures in general|Y\u014dkai|horror or ghost stories|Kaidan}}\n[[File:Kuniyoshi The Ghosts.jpg|thumb|330px|[[Kuniyoshi Utagawa]], ''The Ghosts'', c. 1850.]]\n\nA great deal of interest currently gravitates towards Japanese monsters taken from traditional Japanese sources. Some of the ''y\u014dkai'' or strange beings are the stuff of folklore, orally transmitted and propagated among the populace. But one must realize that many beings or stories about them were spun and deliberately invented by professional writers during the [[Edo Period]] and earlier, and they are not folkloric in the strict sense.\n\n==Folk art and craft==\nSome well-known craft objects such as [[netsuke]], [[raccoon dog]] earthenware ([[Shigaraki ware]]), may be classed as \n[[Japanese craft|traditional Japanese crafts]].\n\nA number of articles of daily household use ({{Nihongo|''mingu''|\u6c11\u5177}}), amassed by [[Keizo Shibusawa]], became the Attic Museum collection, now mostly housed in the [[National Museum of Ethnology (Japan)|National Museum of Ethnology]] in [[Suita, Osaka]].

(c. 1840s, School of [[Hokusai]])]]\n\nAs in most developed nations, it is increasingly difficult to find living storytellers of oral tradition. But there is a wealth of folktales collected through the ages. The name ''mukashi-banashi'' (tales of \"long ago\" or from \"bygone times\") has been applied to the common folktale, since they typically open with the formula \"Mukashi...\"<ref name=heibonsha-mukashi>{{Harvnb|Heibonsha|1964}} encyclopedia, vol.21, p.499-502, \"mukashibanashi\", by Katsumi Masuda</ref> (akin to \"Once upon a time...\"). They also close with some set phrase like \"''dotto harai''\"<ref name=heibonsha-mukashi/> (a variant form being [[Dondo Hare]]).\n\nThese tales had been told in their local dialects, which may be difficult to understand to outsiders, both because of intonation and pronunciation differences, conjugations, and vocabulary. Many folktales collected from the field are actually \"translations\" into standard Japanese (or more like adaptations, merging several collected versions).\n\n===Classic folktales===\nClassic folktales such as ''[[Momotar\u014d]]'', which most Japanese today are familiarized through pictured children's storybooks, manga, or other popularizations, can be traced to [[E-hon|picture-books]] printed in the [[Edo period]], though their prototypical stories may go back much further. The versions retold by children's story author ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Sazanami Iwaya|ja|3=\u5dcc\u8c37\u5c0f\u6ce2|vertical-align=sup}}'' (1870\u20131933)<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Kinoshita|first=Junji|title=''Hy\u014dronshu'' (collected criticisms 1956~1957)|volume=4|publisher=Miraisha(\u672a\u6765\u793e)|year=1974|format=snippet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ubk1AQAAIAAJ}}, p.82, quote:\"\u76f4\u63a5\u6c11\u8846\u306e\u8a9e\u308b\u7269\u8a9e\u304b\u3089\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f)\u5dcc\u8c37\u5c0f\u6ce2\u304c\u5b9a\u578b\u5316\u3057\u3001\u305d\u308c\u304c\u56fd\u5b9a \u6559\u79d1\u66f8\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u5e83\u304f\u666e\u53ca\u3055\u308c\u305f\u305d\u3046\u3044\u3046\u6843\u592a\u90ce\u306e\u8a71\"</ref> had a strong hand in establishing the forms usually known today.\n\n===Animals in folktales===\nTwo creatures are particularly known for their abilities to transform into humans or other beings and objects, the ''[[kitsune]]'' (fox) and ''[[bake-danuki|tanuki]]'' (the [[Japanese raccoon dog]]; pictured). They occur frequently in folktales of humorous nature.\n\nMarriages between humans and non-humans ({{Nihongo|''irui konin tan''|[[:ja:\u7570\u985e\u5a5a\u59fb\u8b5a|\u7570\u985e\u5a5a\u59fb\u8b5a]]|\"tales of heterotype marriages\"}}) comprise a major category or motif in Japanese folklore. Japanese heterotype examples such as the crane story describes a sustained period of married life between the interspecies couple, in contrast to Western examples like [[The Frog Prince (story)|Frog Prince]] or the [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]] myth where the supernatural encounter is brief. An unusual pairing occurs in the story of the {{Nihongo|''{{Interlanguage link multi|Hamaguri ny\u014dbo|ja|3=\u86e4\u5973\u623f|vertical-align=sup}}''|\u86e4\u5973\u623f|\"clam wife\"}}, which exist in both a politer written version (''[[otogi-z\u014dshi]]'') and in a more rustic and vulgar oral tale. The gender is reversed in the tale of ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Tanishi ch\u014dja|ja|3=\u7530\u87ba\u9577\u8005|vertical-align=sup}}'' where a bride is wedded to a tiny ''tanishi'' ([[river snail]]).\n\n===Modern renditions===\nA number of folktales were adapted for stage performance by playwright [[Junji Kinoshita]], notably ''Y\u016bzuru'' (''[[Twilight Crane]]'', 1949),<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Keene|first=Donald|title=Dawn to the West: Japanese Literature of the Modern Era|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1999|format=preview|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kw7q73qBIMoC&pg=PA482|isbn= 978-0-231-11439-4}}, p.482-3</ref> based on the folktale ''[[Tsuru no Ongaeshi]]'' or \"a crane who repaid its gratitude\".\n\nIn the [[American television series]] called ''[[The Yokai King]]'', starring by [[Shin Koyamada]], the characters are based on the Japanese folklore creatures.\n\n===Fantastic creatures===\n{{About||monsters and ghostly creatures in general|Y\u014dkai|horror or ghost stories|Kaidan}}\n[[File:Kuniyoshi The Ghosts.jpg|thumb|330px|[[Kuniyoshi Utagawa]], ''The Ghosts'', c. 1850.]]\n\nA great deal of interest currently gravitates towards Japanese monsters taken from traditional Japanese sources. Some of the ''y\u014dkai'' or strange beings are the stuff of folklore, orally transmitted and propagated among the populace. But one must realize that many beings or stories about them were spun and deliberately invented by professional writers during the [[Edo Period]] and earlier, and they are not folkloric in the strict sense.\n\n==Folk art and craft==\nSome well-known craft objects such as [[netsuke]], [[raccoon dog]] earthenware ([[Shigaraki ware]]), may be classed as \n[[Japanese craft|traditional Japanese crafts]].\n\nA number of articles of daily household use ({{Nihongo|''mingu''|\u6c11\u5177}}), amassed by [[Keizo Shibusawa]], became the Attic Museum collection, now mostly housed in the [[National Museum of Ethnology (Japan)|National Museum of Ethnology]] in [[Suita, Osaka]].

The Canarii called the island '''Tamar\u00e1n''' ('land of the brave\").\n\nIn the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]], after over a century of European incursions and attempts at conquest, the island was conquered on April 29, 1483 by the [[Crown of Castile]], under [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella I]]. The conquest succeeded after a campaign that lasted five years, and it was an important step towards the expansion of the unified Spain.\n\nThe capital city of [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] was founded on June 24, 1478, under the name \"Real de Las Palmas\", by [[Juan Rej\u00f3n]], head of the invading [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] army. In 1492, [[Christopher Columbus]] anchored in the [[Port of Las Palmas]] (and spent some time on the island) on his first trip to the Americas. Las Palmas de Gran Canaria is, jointly with [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]], the capital of the [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of the Canary Islands.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Gc01.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Topography of Gran Canaria]]\n[[File:Gran Canaria 3D version1.gif|thumb|left|Gran Canaria 3D]]\n\nGran Canaria is located in the [[Canary Islands]] archipelago southeast of [[Tenerife]] and west of [[Fuerteventura]]. The island is of [[volcano|volcanic]] origin, mostly made of [[fissure vent]]s. It has a round shape, with a diameter of approximately {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} and a surface area of {{convert|1,560|km2|abbr=on}}. Gran Canaria's maximum elevation is {{convert|1,956|m}} at [[Morro de la Agujereada]], although the nearby [[Pico de las Nieves]] has traditionally been considered the island's tallest peak.\n\n=== Geology ===\nAbout 80% of the volume of the island was formed during the [[Miocene]] period eruptions, between 14 and 9 million years ago. This is called the \"Old Cycle\" and is estimated to have lasted some 200,000 years and have emitted about {{convert|1000|km3|abbr=on}}, mostly of fissural [[alkali basalt]]. This cycle continued with the emission of [[trachyte]]s, [[phonolite]]s and [[peralkaline]] rocks. This period was followed by one of erosion, which lasted some 4 million years.<ref name=\"canarian_volcanoes\">Ara\u00f1a, V and Carracedo, J.C: ''Canarian Volcanoes'', Volume 3: Gran Canaria, pp. 8, 24. Editorial Rueda, Madrid, 1978.</ref>\n\nA second cycle of volcanic eruptions, known as the \"Roque Nublo cycle\", took place between 4.5 and 3.4 million years ago. This shorter cycle emitted about {{convert|100|km3|abbr=on}}. Most of the inland peaks were formed by erosion from these materials. This period also started with fissural basalts, but ended with violent eruptions of [[pyroclastic flows]]. Some phonolitic features, like the Risco Blanco, were also formed in its last stages.<ref name=\"canarian_volcanoes\"/>\n\nThe third or recent cycle is held to have started some 2.8 million years ago and is considered to be still active. The last eruptions are held to have occurred some 3,500 years ago.<ref name=\"canarian_volcanoes\"/>\n\nThe changes in volume and, therefore, weight of the island have also caused the island to rise above the previous sea level during erosive periods and to sink during eruptive periods. Some of these \"fossil beaches\" can be seen in the cliff faces of the more eroded northern coast.<ref name=\"canarian_volcanoes_sealevel\">Oscillations of up to {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the level corresponding to sea level have occurred in geological history. The highest point known is in the Bay of El Confital, Las Palmas ({{convert|130|m|ft|disp=comma|abbr=on}} above current sea level) while subaerial materials have been extracted from a well at {{convert|230|m|ft|abbr=on}} below sea level in the area of La Aldea.

Gran Canaria is noted for its rich variety of [[microclimate]]s. Generally speaking though, the average daytime high ranges from {{convert|20|C|F}} in winter to {{convert|26|C|F}} in summer. Some cool nights occur in winter, but lows below {{convert|10|C|F}} are unknown near the coast. Inland the climate is still mild but mountainous areas see the occasional frost or snow.

Its feast is celebrated on September 8.\n\nThe town of [[Ag\u00fcimes]], on the eastern part of the island, has been carefully restored and its town centre, centered on its old church and a peaceful square, now evokes the quiet living of a traditional Canarian town.

The Canarii called the island '''Tamar\u00e1n''' (\"Land of the Brave\").\n\nIn the [[Medieval period]], after over a century of European incursions and attempts at conquest, the island was conquered on April 29, 1483 by the [[Crown of Castile]], under [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella I]]. The conquest succeeded after a campaign that lasted five years, and it was an important step towards the expansion of the unified Spain.\n\nThe capital city of [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] was founded on June 24, 1478, under the name \"Real de Las Palmas\", by [[Juan Rej\u00f3n]], head of the invading [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] army. In 1492, [[Christopher Columbus]] anchored in the [[Port of Las Palmas]] (and spent some time on the island) on his first trip to the Americas. Las Palmas de Gran Canaria is, jointly with [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]], the capital of the [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of the Canary Islands.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Gc01.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Topography of Gran Canaria]]\n[[File:Gran Canaria 3D version1.gif|thumb|left|Gran Canaria 3D]]\n\nGran Canaria is located in the [[Canary Islands]] archipelago southeast of [[Tenerife]] and west of [[Fuerteventura]]. The island is of [[volcano|volcanic]] origin, mostly made of [[fissure vent]]s. It has a round shape, with a diameter of approximately {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} and a surface area of {{convert|1,560|km2|abbr=on}}. Gran Canaria's maximum elevation is {{convert|1,956|m}} at [[Morro de la Agujereada]], although the nearby [[Pico de las Nieves]] has traditionally been considered the island's tallest peak.\n\n=== Geology ===\nAbout 80% of the volume of the island was formed during the [[Miocene]] period eruptions, between 14 and 9 million years ago. This is called the \"Old Cycle\" and is estimated to have lasted some 200,000 years and have emitted about {{convert|1000|km3|abbr=on}}, mostly of fissural [[alkali basalt]]. This cycle continued with the emission of [[trachyte]]s, [[phonolite]]s and [[peralkaline]] rocks. This period was followed by one of erosion, which lasted some 4 million years.<ref name=\"canarian_volcanoes\">Ara\u00f1a, V and Carracedo, J.C: ''Canarian Volcanoes'', Volume 3: Gran Canaria, pp. 8, 24.

Gran Canaria is noted for its rich variety of [[microclimate]]s. Generally speaking though, the average daytime high ranges from {{convert|20|C|F}} in winter to {{convert|26|C|F}} in summer. Some cool nights occur in winter, but lows below {{convert|10|C|F}} are unknown near the coast. Inland the climate is still mild but mountainous areas see the occasional frost or snow. Annual rainfall averages {{convert|228|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, most of this falling in the cooler months, with July, August and September normally rainless. Rainfall is unevenly distributed through the island with some areas being much drier than others.\nCloud cover and sunshine is often quite variable during the cooler months, and there can be several rather cloudy days at times in winter. Summers are generally quite sunny however, with the south of the island being most favoured.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Gran Canaria Airport (1981\u20132010)\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C = 20.8\n|Feb high C = 21.2\n|Mar high C = 22.3\n|Apr high C = 22.6\n|May high C = 23.6\n|Jun high C = 25.3\n|Jul high C = 26.9\n|Aug high C = 27.5\n|Sep high C = 27.2\n|Oct high C = 26.2\n|Nov high C = 24.2\n|Dec high C = 22.2\n|year high C = 24.2\n|Jan mean C = 17.9\n|Feb mean C = 18.2\n|Mar mean C = 19.0\n|Apr mean C = 19.4\n|May mean C = 20.4\n|Jun mean C = 22.2\n|Jul mean C = 23.8\n|Aug mean C = 24.6\n|Sep mean C = 24.3\n|Oct mean C = 23.1\n|Nov mean C = 21.2\n|Dec mean C = 19.2\n|year mean C = 21.2\n|Jan low C = 15.0\n|Feb low C = 15.0\n|Mar low C = 15.7\n|Apr low C = 16.2\n|May low C = 17.3\n|Jun low C = 19.2\n|Jul low C = 20.8\n|Aug low C = 21.6\n|Sep low C = 21.4\n|Oct low C = 20.1\n|Nov low C = 18.1\n|Dec low C = 16.2\n|year low C = 18.2\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 25\n|Feb precipitation mm = 24\n|Mar precipitation mm = 13\n|Apr precipitation mm = 6\n|May precipitation mm = 1\n|Jun precipitation mm = 0\n|Jul precipitation mm = 0\n|Aug precipitation mm = 0\n|Sep precipitation mm = 9\n|Oct precipitation mm = 16\n|Nov precipitation mm = 22\n|Dec precipitation mm = 31\n|year precipitation mm = 151\n|Jan precipitation days = 3\n|Feb precipitation days = 3\n|Mar precipitation days = 2\n|Apr precipitation days = 1\n|May precipitation days = 0\n|Jun precipitation days = 0\n|Jul precipitation days = 0\n|Aug precipitation days = 0\n|Sep precipitation days = 1\n|Oct precipitation days = 2\n|Nov precipitation days = 4\n|Dec precipitation days = 5\n|unit precipitation days = 1&nbsp;mm\n|year precipitation days = 21\n|Jan sun = 184\n|Feb sun = 191\n|Mar sun = 229\n|Apr sun = 228\n|May sun = 272\n|Jun sun = 284\n|Jul sun = 308\n|Aug sun = 300\n|Sep sun = 241\n|Oct sun = 220\n|Nov sun = 185\n|Dec sun = 179\n|year sun = 2821\n|source 1 = [[Agencia Estatal de Meteorolog\u00eda]] ,<ref>{{cite web\n  |url=http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=C649I&k=coo\n  |title=Standard Climate Values.

It was the first stop of Christopher Columbus' expedition on his way back from the Americas,{{sfn|Andrews & Quintero|2007|p=29}} a commemoration of which is the Hermitage of San Antonio Abad, where the navigator prayed, and the ''Casa de Col\u00f3n''. Other attractions in the capital city include the ''Museo Canario'' (the most important archaeology museum in the archipelago), the cathedral and the ''Plaza del Esp\u00edritu Santo''. In [[Teror]] the shrine of ''[[Virgen del Pino]]'' (\"Virgin of the Pine\"), patron saint of Gran Canaria, can be found. Its feast is celebrated on September 8.\n\nThe town of [[Ag\u00fcimes]], on the eastern part of the island, has been carefully restored and its town centre, centered on its old church and a peaceful square, now evokes the quiet living of a traditional Canarian town. The district also has some of the best preserved cave dwellings, in the protected area of the [[Guayadeque ravine]], where even the church has been built into the mountainside and visitors can find a number of popular cave restaurants. The district also includes the most renowned scuba diving area on the island: the marine reserve at the ''playa de El Cabr\u00f3n'' just outside the town of Arinaga.\n\nOther important towns are [[Telde]], known among other things for their [[Surfing|surf]] schools in Salinetas, Vecindario (within the municipality of Santa Luc\u00eda de Tirajana) and [[G\u00e1ldar]], that contains an important diving zone. In [[Arucas]] there is a Neogothic temple, popularly known as \"Arucas' Cathedral\", as well as a large fertile plain where bananas are grown. In [[G\u00e1ldar]] and its surroundings there is also a banana-growing plain and some remarkable archaeological remains,<ref name=\"estodotuyoMap\">[http://www.estodotuyo.com/mapa-del-patrimonio/ Interactive map of Heritage sites on Grand Canary island] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818133842/http://www.estodotuyo.com/mapa-del-patrimonio/ |date=2016-08-18 }}.
