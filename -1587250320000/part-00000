The reflex of producing goose bumps is known as '''piloerection''' or the '''pilomotor reflex''', or, more traditionally, horripilification. It occurs in many mammals; a prominent example is porcupines, which raise their quills when threatened, or sea otters when they encounter sharks or other predators.\n[[File:PilioerectionAnimation.gif|thumb|1) [[Epidermis]] 2) [[Arrector pili muscle]] 3) [[Hair follicle]] 4) [[Dermis]]  The diagram shows that the arrector pili muscle is connected to the hair follicle and the epidermis resulting in the erection of the hair during muscle contraction causing goosebumps.]]\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[File:Chaire de poule.jpg|thumb|Moderate goose bumps]]\nThe phrase \"goose bumps\" derives from the phenomenon's association with goose skin. Goose feathers grow from spores in the epidermis which resemble human [[hair follicle]]s. When a goose's feathers are plucked, its skin has protrusions where the feathers were, and these bumps are what the human phenomenon resembles.\n\nIt is not clear why the particular fowl, goose, was chosen in English, as most other birds share this same anatomical feature.

For instance, \"hen\" is used in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (''piel de gallina''), [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (''pele de galinha''), [[Romanian language|Romanian]] (''piele de g\u0103in\u0103''), [[French language|French]] (''chair de poule''), [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (''pell de gallina''), [[Slovene language|Slovene]] (''kurja polt'') and in [[Central Italy]] (''ciccia di gallina'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dialettando.com/dizionario/detail.lasso?id=62481|title=Dizionario dei dialetti}}</ref> \"Chicken\" is used in Dutch (''kippenvel''), Chinese (\u96de\u76ae\u7599\u7629, lit. \"lumps on chicken skin\"), [[Finnish language|Finnish]] (''kananliha''), [[Estonian language|Estonian]] (''kananahk''), [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] (''hoendervleis'') and Korean (\ub2ed\uc0b4, ''daksal''). In Hindi/Urdu it is called ''rongtey khade ho jaana''.  The equivalent Japanese term, \u9ce5\u808c, ''torihada'', translates literally as \"bird skin\". In Arabic it is called ''kash'arirah'' (\u0642\u0634\u0639\u0631\u064a\u0631\u0629), while in Hebrew it is called \"duck skin\" (\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05d5\u05d6).

The reflex of producing goose bumps is known as '''piloerection''' or the '''pilomotor reflex''', or, more traditionally, horripilification.

Goose feathers grow from spores in the epidermis which resemble human [[hair follicle]]s.

In an extremely [[stress (biology)|stressful]] situation, the body can employ the \"[[fight-or-flight response|fight or flight]]\" response. As the body prepares itself for either fighting or running, the [[sympathetic nervous system]] floods the blood with [[adrenaline]] (epinephrine), a hormone that speeds up heart rate, [[metabolism]], and body temperature in the presence of extreme stress.  Then the sympathetic nervous system also causes the piloerection reflex, which makes the muscles attached to the base of each hair follicle contract and force the hair up.\n\n=== Music ===\nCanadian researchers have suggested that when humans are moved by music their brains behave as if reacting to delicious [[food]], psychoactive [[drugs]], or [[money]].<ref name=\"SalimpoorEtAl2011\">{{cite journal|last1=Salimpoor|first1=Valorie N.|last2=Benovoy|first2=Mitchel|last3=Larcher|first3=Kevin|last4=Dagher|first4=Alain|last5=Zatorre|first5=Robert J|title=Anatomically distinct dopamine release during anticipation and experience of peak emotion to music|journal=[[Nature Neuroscience]]|date=2011-01-09|volume=14|issue=2|pages=257\u201362|doi=10.1038/nn.2726|pmid=21217764}}</ref> The pleasure experience is driven by the chemical [[dopamine]], which produces physical effects known as \"chills\" that cause changes in heart rate, [[breathing]], temperature and the skin's electrical conductance.

In fact it has to be traced back to the time of Japanese colonization. At that time there was the establishment of Eastern Police Office, Western Police Office, Marine Police Office and Fire Police Office.\n\nAfter the end of Japanese colonization in October 1945, they were used continuously until the official establishment of Police Office of [[Kaohsiung City]] on 8 November 1945. This new police office was in charge of the maintenance of law and order of the whole city. On 14 February 1946, there was the establishment of the 1st and 2nd Precincts, Marine Branch Office and Fire Office. In 1958 the Police Office of [[Kaohsiung City]] was permitted to be promoted as a police department of Grade B system. Meanwhile, two more Precinct Offices were added.\n\nOn 1 July 1970 the police office was furthermore promoted as the only one belonging to Grade A system in Taiwan Police System. Under it, there were 7 Police Precincts established. On 1 July 1979 [[Kaohsiung City]] was officially promoted as a special municipal city under the central government. The Police Office of [[Kaohsiung City]] was officially named as [http://www.kmph.gov.tw/  Kaohsiung Municipal Police Department].\n\n====Island Police Departments in Fujian====\n[[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands|Lien-chiang County]] Police Departments are two local agencies which are historically out of the mainstream of Taiwan police system. The local police forces were merged into the two respective military theater garrison commands once or twice.\n\nSince the direct travel between [[mainland China]] and [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] was opened in 2002, the local police departments are put on heavier duty of border security and immigration checking.\n\n=====[https://web.archive.org/web/20170213164613/http://web.kinmen.gov.tw/Layout/sub_D/index.aspx?frame=79 Kinmen County Police Department]=====\nIts root can be traced back to China in 1915. The local police department was once disbanded in 1949 and replaced by the military security forces under the [[Kinmen]] garrison command. Then, in 1953, along with the reinstatement of [[Kinmen]] County government, [[Kinmen]] PD was detached from military command and assigned to the county government, which was still under the oversight of [[Kinmen]] military committee until 1992.\n\nToday, its table of organization contains 312 police officers and three field police brigades: Forces of \"Criminal Investigation\", \"Special Police\" and \"Traffic Police.\"\n\nThere is no police precincts(\u5206\u5c40) in [[Kinmen]].

In the early years of Japanese rule, rebellions were common especially in rural areas. With the passage of the \"Bandit Laws\", police forces as well as garrison units from the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese military]] were tasked with suppression of rebels, though large scale rebellions had largely died out by 1902. Military and police forces were also involved in the efforts of the colonial government to secure control over the mountainous regions of Taiwan from the [[Taiwanese aborigine]]s around 1910, and a series of smaller attempted rebellions and civil disorders between 1912 and 1916 [https://web.archive.org/web/20050411102623/http://www.educ.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~koma/taiwanpaper.htm]. With the gradual acceptance of Japanese rule sinking in among the general populace by the 1920s, most agitators turned to seeking political change and reform within the established system in the home rule movement, [[Secret police]] forces were tasked with keeping a close watch<ref name=\"Search_Lines\"/> on political groups and agitators.\n\nMost of the members of the police forces during this time were expatriate Japanese, though towards the latter period of Japanese rule, locals began to be recruited. Throughout much of this time, the police forces were granted broad power and authority and allegations of [[police brutality]] were common, especially during the earlier periods of Japanese rule. Consequently, they were not particularly liked by the general populace,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Haddon, R. | title=Mimesis and Motivation in Taiwan Colonial Fiction | publisher=B. C.

Nonetheless, Japan was generally credited for formally establishing law and order in what had previously been a hotbed of rebellion and lawlessness during [[Qing Dynasty]] rule. Much of the law enforcement infrastructure and traditions developed during this time would continue to be used under postwar [[Republic of China|ROC]] rule.\n\n===Police in the early ROC===\n{{see also|Law enforcement in China}}\nThe ROC's law enforcement system built upon the foundations laid down during the [[Qing Dynasty]] with the establishment of the [[Peking]] Public Inspection Headquarters in 1902. Following the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty and the establishment of the Republic in 1912, a National Police Department was established under the auspices of the Ministry of the Interior. This early centralized system consisted of a national headquarters in the capital, provincial police administrations for each province, police departments and bureaus at the municipal and county level respectively. This system was extended to Taiwan following its transfer to ROC control in 1947, two years after the close of hostilities in [[World War II]], though the basic system from the Japanese era was retained.<ref name=\"Search_Lines\"/><ref name=\"Official_History\">{{cite web | title=History | work=National Police Agency, ROC Ministry of the Interior | url=http://www.npa.gov.tw/NPAGip/wSite/ct?xItem=26862&ctNode=11687 | accessdate=2008-04-08| date=2008-03-28 }}</ref>\n\n===Martial Law===\nDuring the period between 19 May 1949 and 14 July 1987, the Taiwan police system had a controversial page in Taiwan history.\n\nBetween 1945 and 1988, police officers in Taiwan wore [[khaki]] uniforms with khaki combination caps similar to those worn by naval officers, or with white plastic helmets similar to the [[U.S. Navy]] [[Shore patrol]]. Critics noted the similarity to military uniforms, eventually leading to the revision of police uniforms in 1988.\n\nOn 5 February 1951, by the power of the now-abolished law of contravention, police officers could grab men with long hairdo and use scissors to cut the men's long hair.

Nevertheless, the governmental body of Taiwan police system back then was and still is subjective to the supervision and coordination of [[National Security Bureau (Republic of China)|National Security Bureau]] of the [[Republic of China|ROC]] National Security Council. The main secret-police work were held up by other security units listed below. Several units in the past like [[National Security Bureau (Republic of China)|National Security Bureau]] or [[Bureau Of Investigation (Taiwan)|National Bureau of Investigation]] were much more fearful or despicable to the people of Taiwan. However, by the end of the Martial-Law era, these so-called \"secret police\" units were legalized, transformed into intelligence-oriented or law-enforcement units, or even disbanded.\n\nThe typical secret-police example of the involvement from several security units is [[Peng Ming-min]], the famous Taiwanese political prisoner since the 1960s. Tipped off by several civilians, Peng was at first arrested by a police detail from local police station in Taipei City. Immediately, he was sent to [[Taiwan Garrison Command]] for interrogation, which was led by its Division of Political Warfare. Sequentially, Peng was courted-martial by a military tribunal organized by \"Division of Judge Advocate General\" of [[Taiwan Garrison Command]]. Peng was pardoned in 1965 but put under house arrest. In 1966, Peng's case was then discussed by National Security Council and transferred from [[Taiwan Garrison Command]] to [[Bureau Of Investigation (Taiwan)|Bureau of Investigation]]. Until his escape in January, 1970, Peng was under the regular visits from local policemen and constant surveillance from agents of [[Bureau Of Investigation (Taiwan)|Bureau of Investigation]].<ref name=peng>{{cite web\n|last=Peng\n|first=Ming-min\n|work=A TASTE OF FREEDOM\n|title=Surveillance\n|date=January 1972\n|url=http://www.hi-on.org.tw/ad/ATASTE.htm#t11\n|accessdate=2008-07-02\n}}</ref>\n\n=====[[Taiwan Garrison Command]]=====\nThe influence to Taiwan of this infamous late [[Taiwan Garrison Command]] under [[ROC Ministry of National Defense|the Ministry of National Defense]] is much too wide, including every aspect like politics, society, economics, culture, and even education, not just confined to the Taiwan police system.

Naturally these military instructors are also commissioned officers in active duty either dispatched from or trained by the branch of Political Warfare. Before 1995, one of their missions at school is to closely watch, report, or even suppress any possible anti-government or political activity launched by students on or off campus.\n\n=====[[Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau]]=====\nThe [[Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau]] was originated from the other controversial [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]] security unit, the [[Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics]], so-called \"Zhong-Tong\" or literally \"Central Statistics\" Zhong-Tong was subordinate to the Central Executive Committee of [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist Party]] before 1949.\n\n=====[[National Security Bureau (Republic of China)|National Security Bureau]]=====\nThe [[National Security Bureau (Republic of China)|National Security Bureau]] of the ROC National Security Council was established at the suggestion of [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] in 1956. This bureau served as the primary intelligence unit in Taiwan and headed by Cheng Jie-Min (\u912d\u4ecb\u6c11), a heavy-weight three-star army general from '''Military-Statistics'''. The purpose of creating such a new intelligence agency was to settle the inter-agency rivalry among the intelligence community in Taiwan and allow more direct access for [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and [[Chiang Ching-kuo]].\n\n===Post-Martial Law era reforms===\nIn 1990, Chuang Heng-dai (\u838a\u4ea8\u5cb1), by then the Commissioner of Railway Police Bureau, became the first career police officer with the background of a criminal investigator to take over the chief of NPA. Since then, all the successive directors-general of NPA are promoted from career police officers in active duty within the Taiwan police system.<ref name=\"badges\"/>\n\nThe Taiwan Provincial Police Administration was again separated from the NPA in 1995 with the implementation of local autonomy statutes in the [[Constitution of the Republic of China|ROC Constitution]]. [[Fire fighting|Fire-fighting]] units also ceased to be part of the NPA from that year and were reorganized into a separate [[fire department]]. [[National Fire Agency]] of Ministry of Interior was established on 1 March 1995 to be responsible for fire prevention, disaster rescue and emergency medical service.\n\nIn 1999, with the downsizing of the provincial level of government, the Taiwan Provincial Police Administration was dissolved and its personnel and responsibilities were once again transferred to the National Police Agency.<ref name=\"Official_History\"/>\n\nAn increase in crime and liberalization of the mass media in the 1990s led to many questions concerning the effectiveness of the police force in investigating and fighting crime, as opposed to its prior concentration on crowd and [[riot control]], a carryover from the martial law era.\n\n===Recent years===\nWith increased media coverage in recent years and the proliferation of tabloid newspapers and 24-hour cable news channels throughout Taiwan, the police force has been faced with new challenges involving high-profile crimes, and increased media involvement.<ref>\n{{cite news \n|last=Lin\n|first=Jean\n|title=MOI details new rules on media access to airport\n|date=2006-02-28 \n|newspaper=The Taipei Times\n|page=2\n|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2006/02/28/2003295000\n}}</ref> Past concerns of police corruption have largely been replaced by concerns of police ineffectiveness, particularly in light of several high-profile cases in recent years.

The four stood in the center of the river for three hours, waiting for a helicopter that never came, and were finally washed away at around 7:08pm in sight of family members, helpless would-be rescuers, and the lens of news cameras on the riverbank.<ref>\n{{cite news \n|last=Jou\n|first= Ying-cheng\n|title=Outrage over river tragedy\n|date= 2000-07-24 \n|newspaper=The Taipei Times\n|page=1\n|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2000/07/24/44920\n}}</ref> The delay was attributed to bureaucratic [[red tape]] and three top government officials resigned, including [[Yu Shyi-kun]], the vice Premier of [[Executive Yuan]] and two Director-Generals from National Police Agency and National Fire Agency. This Pachang-Creek incident ([[:zh:\u516b\u638c\u6eaa\u4e8b\u4ef6]]) caused a field day for the news media in Taiwan and triggered a reform of the airborne emergency management system. On 10 March 2004, the newly formed '''National Airborne Service Corps''' (NASC) of the Ministry of Interior absorbed four civil airborne squadrons\n:The Airborne Squadron of National Police Agency,\n:The Preparatory Office of the Airborne Fire Fighting Squadron of National Fire Agency,\n:The Aviation Team of Civil Aeronautics Administration of Ministry of Transportation and Communications,\n:The Air Patrol Squadron of the Coast Guard Administration.\nNASC takes over the responsibilities of five major airborne tasks:Search and Rescue, Disaster Relief, Emergency Medical Services, Reconnaissance and Patrol, and Transportation.\n\nOn 26 July 2004, members of the Criminal Investigation Bureau engaged in what was arguably the largest gun battle in the history of modern Taiwan with members of a kidnapping gang in [[Kaohsiung County]] (now part of [[Kaohsiung City]]). Though they held a numerical advantage, the officers found themselves outgunned by the suspects who possessed bulletproof vests and [[M16 (rifle)|M16]]'s. In the ensuing gunfight four police officers were injured, and two suspects were shot and arrested. However the ringleader of the gang managed to escape along with a cohort after holding a passing civilian hostage and escaping in a hijacked car on live TV.<ref name=\"Zhang_Xi_Ming\"/> The ensuing manhunt was widely covered, the ringleader {{ill|Chang Hsi-ming|zh|\u5f35\u932b\u9298}}) was finally arrested following another gun battle with police on 13 July 2005.<ref>{{cite news \n|last=Chuang\n|first=Jimmy\n|title=Dreaded gangster caught after gunfight \n|date=  2005-07-14 |newspaper= The Taipei Times\n|url= http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2005/07/14/2003263424\n|page= 1\n|accessdate=2007-01-16\n}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 February 2006, [[Hou You-yi]], the Criminal Investigation Bureau Commissioner, assumed command as the director-general of the National Police Agency.<ref>\n{{cite news \n|title=Hou Yu-ih becomes youngest-ever NPA director-general \n|date=2006-02-28 \n|newspaper=The Taipei Times\n|page=3\n|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2006/02/28/2003295011\n}}</ref> He, a career criminal investigator, is the youngest-ever to hold that post. {{ill|Wang Cho-chiun|zh|\u738b\u5353\u921e}}, Chief of Taipei City Police Department, was named as the new director-general effective June 2008.<ref>\n{{cite news \n|title=Taipei police chief to head NPA\n|date=2008-05-10 \n|newspaper=China Post\n|page=1\n|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national%20news/2008/05/10/155737/Taipei-police.htm\n}}</ref>\n\nOn 2 Jan 2007, according to \"the Organic Law of the National Immigration Agency\" enacted on 30 Nov 2005, the NPA's former '''Immigration Office''' was expanded to become the [[National Immigration Agency]] under the direct control of the Ministry of the Interior, and Wu Cheng-chi (\u5433\u632f\u5409) was named the first director general of NIA.\n\n==Policing in the ROC==\n[[Image:Taipei police car.jpg|thumb|Police car on night patrol in Taipei.]]\n[[Image:Taipei Police New Years Eve.jpg|thumb|Taipei police officers performing crowd control during New Year's Eve celebrations.]]\n[[Image:Ford Mondeo of Fifth Precinct, Taichung City Police Bureau Y3-8640 20051115.jpg|thumb|An NPA patrol car (5th Precinct, Taichung City Police Department).]]\n\n===General information===\nIn addition to normal law enforcement duties, police in the ROC are charged with other slightly more unusual duties such as taking [[census]] data, as well as immigration and visa related issues.<ref>{{cite web|title=Regulations Governing the Inspection and Registration of Alien's Residence or Permanent Residence |work=National Police Agency, ROC Ministry of the Interior |url=http://www.npa.gov.tw/eng/law1.htm#c |accessdate=2006-03-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212103545/http://www.npa.gov.tw/eng/law1.htm |archivedate=February 12, 2006 }} \"The inspection and registration affairs as prescribed in these Regulations shall be planned by the National Police Agency (NPA) of the Ministry of the Interior, and executed by city or county (city) police under the supervision of the NPA before the Bureau of Immigration of the Ministry of the Interior is established.\"</ref> Most jurisdictions also have a Foreign Affairs squad staffed by English speaking officers tasked with visa enforcement and issues relating to foreigners or the foreign community in Taiwan.\n\nWith the exception of traffic police in some local departments, all police officers carry small firearms (notably the [[Walther PPQ]] pistol, [[Smith & Wesson M&P]] compact or [[Glock]] sidearms for detectives) and batons. A criticism that has emerged in recent years is that police officers generally do not carry any [[nonlethal weapons]] aside from batons such as [[taser]]s or [[pepper spray]], limiting their options when dealing with violent criminals. Police in Taiwan have sometimes been known to fire warning shots or at the legs of fleeing suspects, though this practice has reportedly decreased in recent years.\n\nMost police officers patrol in marked [[police car]]s or small [[motorscooter]]s. [[Motorcycles]] are typically used only by the traffic police. Police officers patrol with the [[light bar]]s on their cars turned on. Like many other nations in the Asia Pacific region, the emergency number for police in Taiwan is [[1-1-0]].\n\n====Local Stations====\nIn Taiwan, including islands of [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]], there are a total of 1,615 various local police stations.<ref name=stations/>\n\nTypically, there are 16 police officers, including a station chief and a sergeant, in a local police station.\n\nUsually, a counter is placed in the 24-hour-opened main entrance and a pistol-armed police officer would sit there as the station duty officer, or '''watch commander''', on a 2-or-4-hour watch. The '''watch commander''' is the main funnel between that station and civilians within its area of responsibility. He or she is in charge of the safety of the station, including the security of firearms and ammunition. The station duty officer must answer all personal or telephone complaints from civilians, delegate those reports to proper desk police officers, dispatch police officers on patrol to respond, or provide legal advice to common citizens. Also, the station duty officer would reply to all information requests concerning suspicious persons or vehicles over radio communication.\n\nIn remote areas or due to manpower shortage, some local stations are allowed by regulation to close the main gate between 2200 and 0600 hrs, but one police officer must remain inside.\n\n===Selection and training===\nCareer police officers are trained at either the [[Taiwan Police College]] in Taipei City or the [[Central Police University]] in Taoyuan City. The Taiwan Police College provides basic training for entry level police officers assigned to patrol duty, while the Police University provides more advanced training for manager level or active duty officers in [[forensics]], [[Administration (business)|administration]], traffic control, fire control and science, border police, crime investigation, maritime police, [[foreign policy]], [[information management]], [[law]] and other related subjects.\n\nIn 2006, police selection criteria were amended to include all persons with a high school diploma between ages 18\u201328 able to pass a police civil service exam and undergo one year of training. This removed the past requirement where only graduates of specialized police colleges and universities were allowed to become police officers.<ref>{{cite web| title=\u8b66\u5bdf\u7279\u8003\u5927\u5e45\u653e\u5bec\u61c9\u8003\u8cc7\u683c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u5fd7\u8b66\u5bdf\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u65b0\u9078\u64c7| work=ROC Ministry of Examination| url=http://wwwc.moex.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=10865&ctNode=928| accessdate=2007-11-04| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928025411/http://wwwc.moex.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=10865&ctNode=928| archivedate=2007-09-28}}</ref>\n\nConscripts may also choose to fulfill their mandatory twenty month national service requirement in the Police Department following basic training. Conscripts are typically deployed to assist local officers in positions such as traffic control, riot control, secretarial work, and basic patrol. Conscripts serving in the police force are generally not issued firearms.\n\n===Uniforms===\n[[Image:Train and police at Platform 1B, THSR Taichung Station 20070105b.jpg|thumb|NPA railway police officers at HSR Taichung Station.]]\n\nMost police officers, since 1988, wear the standard uniform which consists of dark blue pants, the [[Combination cap]] with a gold band or a baseball cap, a jacket or an overcoat in winter, and a light Grey shirt. Dark-blue or yellow windbreakers attached white reflective strips are sometimes also issued, with white letters \"POLICE\" and \"\u8b66\u5bdf\" on the back. All uniform buttons or decorations are golden yellow. A golden rank insignia is worn over the right breast pocket of the shirt. Two patches are worn, one on each shoulder: one with the golden NPA insignia, department name, and serial number. The second patch may be optional and is specific to the squad or unit the officer belongs to.\n\nCourt bailiffs, volunteer police officers, and civil defense personnel wear the same uniforms with small variations. The cap insignia worn by volunteer police officers is silver white rather than gold, as are the decorations and the shoulder patches. Instead of the golden rank insignia over the right breast pocket, volunteer policemen wear name tags.\n\nVolunteer traffic police personnel wear similar uniforms with same style but with a high visibility orange shirt, and usually bear no rank.\n\nMembers of certain [[SWAT]] units will usually wear dark blue [[Battle Dress Uniform|BDU]] style uniforms rather than the regular one. Detectives typically dress in plainclothes.\n\nConscripts serving alternative national service with the police wear [[khaki]] uniforms instead of the standard police blue.\n\n==Interdepartmental cooperation==\n\n===Bureau of Investigation===\n{{main|Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau}}\n\n[[File:MJIB.jpg|thumb|Bureau of Investigation]]\n\nRegarding drugs, corruptions, espionage, and economic crimes, the Investigative Bureau of Ministry of Justice (MJIB) has developed stronger capability to cover cases in those categories for decades. The investigation of these cases, police corruption included, are usually transferred to or led by the Bureau of Investigation.\n\nMJIB officers are equipped with a strong laboratory-testing capacity regarding controlled substances. This gives a necessary advantage and training for the investigators of MJIB. However, the police forces in the ROC still maintain several active drug enforcement squads at the local police departments and the Criminal Investigation Bureau of NPA.\n\nHistorically, counter-intelligence affairs are under the turf of MJIB. Different from \"[[Special Branch|special branch]]\" in the [[Policing in the United Kingdom|police system in United Kingdom]], the security divisions at all levels of Taiwan police system are mainly staff units, not fielded police details. Under the supervision of [[National Security Bureau (Republic of China)|National Security Bureau]], all non-mililary cases of espionage would soon be moved to the Bureau of Investigation.\n\nA few years ago, high-ranking police officials tried to develop the strength of investigating [[white-collar crime]]s in the ROC police system but gained unnoticed progress. The MJIB is still in the lead position of cracking economic crimes or money-laundry. However, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of NPA has built fair reputation on [[copyright]] protection and the safety of computers and networks. Also, regarding the [[copyright]] issue, the 1st brigade of the 2nd special police corps is especially tasked for the enforcement related to intellectual property.\n\n=== Military Police ===\n{{main|Republic of China Military Police}}\n[[File:ROC Military Police Headquarters Main Gate 20100718.jpg|thumb|Military Police]]\n\nIn the ROC, the usual cases for local police to bring in the military police are military deserters or traffic accidents involving military vehicles or personnel.\n\nThe latter one is a very interesting situation, in that ROC civilians tend to shake down the related military units when such kind of accidents occur. For some paranoid thinking, people in the ROC military presume that the local policemen would side with civilians. As an unofficial rule in all ROC armed forces, all military drivers, and commissioned or non-commissioned officers are frequently instructed to call in the military police when they find themselves are in the middle of such a vehicular incident.\n\nContrary to common belief, military police can actively go after civilian criminals, although usually they choose not to muddle the gray area after the lifting of martial law on 15 July 1987. According to the \"Law of the dispatching of Judicial Police Personnel,\" military police can deal with civilian affairs under the supervision of the public prosecutor(s) from all court prosecutors' offices at all levels under the Ministry of Justice. Sometimes public prosecutors will direct military police to handle large-scale searches or arrests when investigating cases of police-related crimes, prostitution, or fugitive recovery.<ref>{{cite news\n |script-title = zh:\u61b2\u8abf\u7d44 \u56db\u6708\u8d77\u4f75\u5165\u61b2\u5175\u968a\n |author       = \u8a31\u7d39\u8ed2\n |date         = 2005-02-25\n |publisher    = The Liberty Times\n |url          = http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2005/new/feb/25/today-p11.htm\n |page         = 11\n |language     = Chinese\n |accessdate   = 2007-07-18\n |url-status      = dead\n |archiveurl   = https://web.archive.org/web/20080311045332/http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2005/new/feb/25/today-p11.htm\n |archivedate  = 2008-03-11\n}}</ref>\n\nRegarding [[counter-terrorism]], there are three company-size troops of [[special forces]] under the operational control of [[ROC Ministry of National Defense|the Ministry of National Defense]]:<ref>{{cite news\n |script-title = zh:\u9678\u8ecd\u72d9\u64ca\u5175 \u795e\u7955\u66dd\u5149\n |author       = \u9673\u5b97\u9038\n |date         = 2006-10-19\n |publisher    = New Taiwan News Weekly\n |url          = http://www.newtaiwan.com.tw/bulletinview.jsp?bulletinid=64391\n |language     = Chinese\n |accessdate   = 2008-07-03\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110718161615/http://www.newtaiwan.com.tw/bulletinview.jsp?bulletinid=64391\n |archive-date = 2011-07-18\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n |script-title = zh:\u6a21\u64ec\u6a5f\u5834\u653b\u53f0 \u4e2d\u570b\u6e96\u5099\u597d\u4e86\uff1f\n |author       = \u9673\u5b97\u9038\n |date         = 2008-07-03\n |publisher    = New Taiwan News Weekly\n |url          = http://www.newtaiwan.com.tw/bulletinview.jsp?bulletinid=81113\n |language     = Chinese\n |accessdate   = 2008-07-03\n |url-status      = dead\n |archiveurl   = https://web.archive.org/web/20110718161512/http://www.newtaiwan.com.tw/bulletinview.jsp?bulletinid=81113\n |archivedate  = 2011-07-18\n}}</ref>\n* Northern Taiwan: Military Police Special Service Company ([[MPSSC]], Code Name: '''Night Hawk'''), [[Republic of China Military Police|Military Police Command]].\n* Central Taiwan: Special Warfare Special Service Company, Aviation, Airborne and Special Warfare Command of the [[Republic of China Army]].\n* Southern Taiwan: Marine Special Service Company, [[Republic of China Marine Corps|Marine Corps Command]] of the [[Republic of China Navy]].\nThese three are tasked to handle combat situations involving international terrorists, mercenary or para-military criminals. Bound by laws, currently only [[MPSSC|the Military Police Special Service Company]] can react to non-military cases, like airplane hijacking.\n\n===Coast Guard===\n{{main|Coast Guard Administration (Taiwan)}}\n[[File:2007-11-13 Headquarters of Coast Guard Administration, Executive Yuan.jpg|thumb|Coast Guard]]\n\nThe shore lines of Taiwan are under multiple protections from several law enforcement units in Taiwan.\n\nThe history of Taiwan's [[Coast Guard Administration (Taiwan)|Coast Guard Administration]] can be traced back to several origins. One of these is the former 7th [[Special Police]] Corps, which was expanded from the late and unique River Patrol squadron of the [[Taipei County]] (now New Taipei City) Police Department. The land branches of Coast Guard Administration originate from the controversial [[Taiwan Garrison Command]], which no longer exists, but the formations of land patrol forces were inherited from the ROC Army. Because of its interesting and complicated origins, the Coast Guard Administration does not always go along well with the police, especially when problems related to legal jurisdiction on land occur.\n\nSmuggling and arms trafficking has been a long been an issue in Taiwan. Human-trafficking and its counterpart, prostitution, are increasingly serious problems in Taiwan. The maritime patrol of the Coast Guard Administration have the responsibility to stop those crimes at sea, and the coastal patrol of Coast Guard Administration are responsible for intercepting such criminal cases along the coast of Taiwan. The in-land territory of Taiwan should be the responsibility of individual local police departments or national law enforcement units from the NPA or MJIB.\n\nCases like smuggling and human-trafficking may cause turf wars between competing law enforcement agencies. In some examples, when brothels were raided by plain-clothes peace officers, the pimp would quietly go to the local police station and gather possible information about his girls in detention, but sometimes the pimp would later find that his girls were held up by the local coastal patrol units.\n\n===Fire Brigades===\n{{main|National Fire Agency}}\n[[File:Fire engines of Fuxing Branch, Taipei City Fire Department 20100721a.jpg|thumb|Fire brigades]]\n\nTaiwan Firemen were a part of the Taiwan Police before 1995. At that time, the Fire Policemen were not the most favorite people in the eyes of certain police chiefs. The most extreme case was in [[Taipei County]] (now New Taipei City) Police Department: the [[Taipei County]] Police Commissioner Yao Kao-Chiao (\u59da\u9ad8\u6a4b) assigned all his fire policemen to kitchen duty because he felt his fire policemen were doing nothing except waiting for a fire to happen.\n\nIt is worth to point out that Yao Kao-Chiao was the Directors-General of [[Central Police University]] from May 1995 to June 1996, of National Police Agency from June 1996 to 1997, and of [[Republic of China Coast Guard|Coast Guard Administration]] from 28 January 2000 until 21 May 2000.\n\nAlso, in Taiwan, another contradiction was the radio call signs for the fire trucks or rescue vehicles. For reasons to avoid unwanted attentions and to remain secrecy, all radio call signs for all police vehicles were uncorrelated with the missions of the subject vehicles, unnecessarily including fire trucks, rescue vehicles, and ambulances of fire brigades.

In fact it has to be traced back to the time of Japanese colonization. At that time there was the establishment of Eastern Police Office, Western Police Office, Marine Police Office and Fire Police Office.\n\nAfter the end of Japanese colonization in October 1945, they were used continuously until the official establishment of Police Office of [[Kaohsiung City]] on 8 November 1945. This new police office was in charge of the maintenance of law and order of the whole city. On 14 February 1946, there was the establishment of the 1st and 2nd Precincts, Marine Branch Office and Fire Office.

In the early years of Japanese rule, rebellions were common especially in rural areas. With the passage of the \"Bandit Laws\", police forces as well as garrison units from the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese military]] were tasked with suppression of rebels, though large scale rebellions had largely died out by 1902. Military and police forces were also involved in the efforts of the colonial government to secure control over the mountainous regions of Taiwan from the [[Taiwanese aborigine]]s around 1910, and a series of smaller attempted rebellions and civil disorders between 1912 and 1916 [https://web.archive.org/web/20050411102623/http://www.educ.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~koma/taiwanpaper.htm].

Throughout much of this time, the police forces were granted broad power and authority and allegations of [[police brutality]] were common, especially during the earlier periods of Japanese rule. Consequently, they were not particularly liked by the general populace,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Haddon, R. | title=Mimesis and Motivation in Taiwan Colonial Fiction | publisher=B. C.

Nonetheless, Japan was generally credited for formally establishing law and order in what had previously been a hotbed of rebellion and lawlessness during [[Qing Dynasty]] rule. Much of the law enforcement infrastructure and traditions developed during this time would continue to be used under postwar [[Republic of China|ROC]] rule.\n\n===Police in the early ROC===\n{{see also|Law enforcement in China}}\nThe ROC's law enforcement system built upon the foundations laid down during the [[Qing Dynasty]] with the establishment of the [[Peking]] Public Inspection Headquarters in 1902. Following the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty and the establishment of the Republic in 1912, a National Police Department was established under the auspices of the Ministry of the Interior. This early centralized system consisted of a national headquarters in the capital, provincial police administrations for each province, police departments and bureaus at the municipal and county level respectively. This system was extended to Taiwan following its transfer to ROC control in 1947, two years after the close of hostilities in [[World War II]], though the basic system from the Japanese era was retained.<ref name=\"Search_Lines\"/><ref name=\"Official_History\">{{cite web | title=History | work=National Police Agency, ROC Ministry of the Interior | url=http://www.npa.gov.tw/NPAGip/wSite/ct?xItem=26862&ctNode=11687 | accessdate=2008-04-08| date=2008-03-28 }}</ref>\n\n===Martial Law===\nDuring the period between 19 May 1949 and 14 July 1987, the Taiwan police system had a controversial page in Taiwan history.\n\nBetween 1945 and 1988, police officers in Taiwan wore [[khaki]] uniforms with khaki combination caps similar to those worn by naval officers, or with white plastic helmets similar to the [[U.S. Navy]] [[Shore patrol]]. Critics noted the similarity to military uniforms, eventually leading to the revision of police uniforms in 1988.\n\nOn 5 February 1951, by the power of the now-abolished law of contravention, police officers could grab men with long hairdo and use scissors to cut the men's long hair.

Nevertheless, the governmental body of Taiwan police system back then was and still is subjective to the supervision and coordination of [[National Security Bureau (Republic of China)|National Security Bureau]] of the [[Republic of China|ROC]] National Security Council. The main secret-police work were held up by other security units listed below. Several units in the past like [[National Security Bureau (Republic of China)|National Security Bureau]] or [[Bureau Of Investigation (Taiwan)|National Bureau of Investigation]] were much more fearful or despicable to the people of Taiwan. However, by the end of the Martial-Law era, these so-called \"secret police\" units were legalized, transformed into intelligence-oriented or law-enforcement units, or even disbanded.\n\nThe typical secret-police example of the involvement from several security units is [[Peng Ming-min]], the famous Taiwanese political prisoner since the 1960s. Tipped off by several civilians, Peng was at first arrested by a police detail from local police station in Taipei City. Immediately, he was sent to [[Taiwan Garrison Command]] for interrogation, which was led by its Division of Political Warfare. Sequentially, Peng was courted-martial by a military tribunal organized by \"Division of Judge Advocate General\" of [[Taiwan Garrison Command]]. Peng was pardoned in 1965 but put under house arrest. In 1966, Peng's case was then discussed by National Security Council and transferred from [[Taiwan Garrison Command]] to [[Bureau Of Investigation (Taiwan)|Bureau of Investigation]]. Until his escape in January, 1970, Peng was under the regular visits from local policemen and constant surveillance from agents of [[Bureau Of Investigation (Taiwan)|Bureau of Investigation]].<ref name=peng>{{cite web\n|last=Peng\n|first=Ming-min\n|work=A TASTE OF FREEDOM\n|title=Surveillance\n|date=January 1972\n|url=http://www.hi-on.org.tw/ad/ATASTE.htm#t11\n|accessdate=2008-07-02\n}}</ref>\n\n=====[[Taiwan Garrison Command]]=====\nThe influence to Taiwan of this infamous late [[Taiwan Garrison Command]] under [[ROC Ministry of National Defense|the Ministry of National Defense]] is much too wide, including every aspect like politics, society, economics, culture, and even education, not just confined to the Taiwan police system.

On 10 March 2004, the newly formed '''National Airborne Service Corps''' (NASC) of the Ministry of Interior absorbed four civil airborne squadrons\n:The Airborne Squadron of National Police Agency,\n:The Preparatory Office of the Airborne Fire Fighting Squadron of National Fire Agency,\n:The Aviation Team of Civil Aeronautics Administration of Ministry of Transportation and Communications,\n:The Air Patrol Squadron of the Coast Guard Administration.\nNASC takes over the responsibilities of five major airborne tasks\uff1aSearch and Rescue, Disaster Relief, Emergency Medical Services, Reconnaissance and Patrol, and Transportation.\n\nOn 26 July 2004, members of the Criminal Investigation Bureau engaged in what was arguably the largest gun battle in the history of modern Taiwan with members of a kidnapping gang in [[Kaohsiung County]] (now part of [[Kaohsiung City]]). Though they held a numerical advantage, the officers found themselves outgunned by the suspects who possessed bulletproof vests and [[M16 (rifle)|M16]]'s. In the ensuing gunfight four police officers were injured, and two suspects were shot and arrested. However the ringleader of the gang managed to escape along with a cohort after holding a passing civilian hostage and escaping in a hijacked car on live TV.<ref name=\"Zhang_Xi_Ming\"/> The ensuing manhunt was widely covered, the ringleader {{ill|Chang Hsi-ming|zh|\u5f35\u932b\u9298}}) was finally arrested following another gun battle with police on 13 July 2005.<ref>{{cite news \n|last=Chuang\n|first=Jimmy\n|title=Dreaded gangster caught after gunfight \n|date=  2005-07-14 |newspaper= The Taipei Times\n|url= http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2005/07/14/2003263424\n|page= 1\n|accessdate=2007-01-16\n}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 February 2006, [[Hou You-yi]], the Criminal Investigation Bureau Commissioner, assumed command as the director-general of the National Police Agency.<ref>\n{{cite news \n|title=Hou Yu-ih becomes youngest-ever NPA director-general \n|date=2006-02-28 \n|newspaper=The Taipei Times\n|page=3\n|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2006/02/28/2003295011\n}}</ref> He, a career criminal investigator, is the youngest-ever to hold that post. {{ill|Wang Cho-chiun|zh|\u738b\u5353\u921e}}, Chief of Taipei City Police Department, was named as the new director-general effective June 2008.<ref>\n{{cite news \n|title=Taipei police chief to head NPA\n|date=2008-05-10 \n|newspaper=China Post\n|page=1\n|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national%20news/2008/05/10/155737/Taipei-police.htm\n}}</ref>\n\nOn 2 Jan 2007, according to \"the Organic Law of the National Immigration Agency\" enacted on 30 Nov 2005, the NPA's former '''Immigration Office''' was expanded to become the [[National Immigration Agency]] under the direct control of the Ministry of the Interior, and Wu Cheng-chi (\u5433\u632f\u5409) was named the first director general of NIA.\n\n==Policing in the ROC==\n[[Image:Taipei police car.jpg|thumb|Police car on night patrol in Taipei.]]\n[[Image:Taipei Police New Years Eve.jpg|thumb|Taipei police officers performing crowd control during New Year's Eve celebrations.]]\n[[Image:Ford Mondeo of Fifth Precinct, Taichung City Police Bureau Y3-8640 20051115.jpg|thumb|An NPA patrol car (5th Precinct, Taichung City Police Department).]]\n\n===General information===\nIn addition to normal law enforcement duties, police in the ROC are charged with other slightly more unusual duties such as taking [[census]] data, as well as immigration and visa related issues.<ref>{{cite web|title=Regulations Governing the Inspection and Registration of Alien's Residence or Permanent Residence |work=National Police Agency, ROC Ministry of the Interior |url=http://www.npa.gov.tw/eng/law1.htm#c |accessdate=2006-03-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212103545/http://www.npa.gov.tw/eng/law1.htm |archivedate=February 12, 2006 }} \"The inspection and registration affairs as prescribed in these Regulations shall be planned by the National Police Agency (NPA) of the Ministry of the Interior, and executed by city or county (city) police under the supervision of the NPA before the Bureau of Immigration of the Ministry of the Interior is established.\"</ref> Most jurisdictions also have a Foreign Affairs squad staffed by English speaking officers tasked with visa enforcement and issues relating to foreigners or the foreign community in Taiwan.\n\nWith the exception of traffic police in some local departments, all police officers carry small firearms (notably the [[Walther PPQ]] pistol, [[Smith & Wesson M&P]] compact or [[Glock]] sidearms for detectives) and batons. A criticism that has emerged in recent years is that police officers generally do not carry any [[nonlethal weapons]] aside from batons such as [[taser]]s or [[pepper spray]], limiting their options when dealing with violent criminals. Police in Taiwan have sometimes been known to fire warning shots or at the legs of fleeing suspects, though this practice has reportedly decreased in recent years.\n\nMost police officers patrol in marked [[police car]]s or small [[motorscooter]]s. [[Motorcycles]] are typically used only by the traffic police. Police officers patrol with the [[light bar]]s on their cars turned on. Like many other nations in the Asia Pacific region, the emergency number for police in Taiwan is [[1-1-0]].\n\n====Local Stations====\nIn Taiwan, including islands of [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]], there are a total of 1,615 various local police stations.<ref name=stations/>\n\nTypically, there are 16 police officers, including a station chief and a sergeant, in a local police station.\n\nUsually, a counter is placed in the 24-hour-opened main entrance and a pistol-armed police officer would sit there as the station duty officer, or '''watch commander''', on a 2-or-4-hour watch. The '''watch commander''' is the main funnel between that station and civilians within its area of responsibility. He or she is in charge of the safety of the station, including the security of firearms and ammunition. The station duty officer must answer all personal or telephone complaints from civilians, delegate those reports to proper desk police officers, dispatch police officers on patrol to respond, or provide legal advice to common citizens. Also, the station duty officer would reply to all information requests concerning suspicious persons or vehicles over radio communication.\n\nIn remote areas or due to manpower shortage, some local stations are allowed by regulation to close the main gate between 2200 and 0600 hrs, but one police officer must remain inside.\n\n===Selection and training===\nCareer police officers are trained at either the [[Taiwan Police College]] in Taipei City or the [[Central Police University]] in Taoyuan City. The Taiwan Police College provides basic training for entry level police officers assigned to patrol duty, while the Police University provides more advanced training for manager level or active duty officers in [[forensics]], [[Administration (business)|administration]], traffic control, fire control and science, border police, crime investigation, maritime police, [[foreign policy]], [[information management]], [[law]] and other related subjects.\n\nIn 2006, police selection criteria were amended to include all persons with a high school diploma between ages 18\u201328 able to pass a police civil service exam and undergo one year of training. This removed the past requirement where only graduates of specialized police colleges and universities were allowed to become police officers.<ref>{{cite web| title=\u8b66\u5bdf\u7279\u8003\u5927\u5e45\u653e\u5bec\u61c9\u8003\u8cc7\u683c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u5fd7\u8b66\u5bdf\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u65b0\u9078\u64c7| work=ROC Ministry of Examination| url=http://wwwc.moex.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=10865&ctNode=928| accessdate=2007-11-04| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928025411/http://wwwc.moex.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=10865&ctNode=928| archivedate=2007-09-28}}</ref>\n\nConscripts may also choose to fulfill their mandatory twenty month national service requirement in the Police Department following basic training. Conscripts are typically deployed to assist local officers in positions such as traffic control, riot control, secretarial work, and basic patrol. Conscripts serving in the police force are generally not issued firearms.\n\n===Uniforms===\n[[Image:Train and police at Platform 1B, THSR Taichung Station 20070105b.jpg|thumb|NPA railway police officers at HSR Taichung Station.]]\n\nMost police officers, since 1988, wear the standard uniform which consists of dark blue pants, the [[Combination cap]] with a gold band or a baseball cap, a jacket or an overcoat in winter, and a light Grey shirt. Dark-blue or yellow windbreakers attached white reflective strips are sometimes also issued, with white letters \"POLICE\" and \"\u8b66\u5bdf\" on the back. All uniform buttons or decorations are golden yellow. A golden rank insignia is worn over the right breast pocket of the shirt. Two patches are worn, one on each shoulder: one with the golden NPA insignia, department name, and serial number. The second patch may be optional and is specific to the squad or unit the officer belongs to.\n\nCourt bailiffs, volunteer police officers, and civil defense personnel wear the same uniforms with small variations. The cap insignia worn by volunteer police officers is silver white rather than gold, as are the decorations and the shoulder patches. Instead of the golden rank insignia over the right breast pocket, volunteer policemen wear name tags.\n\nVolunteer traffic police personnel wear similar uniforms with same style but with a high visibility orange shirt, and usually bear no rank.\n\nMembers of certain [[SWAT]] units will usually wear dark blue [[Battle Dress Uniform|BDU]] style uniforms rather than the regular one. Detectives typically dress in plainclothes.\n\nConscripts serving alternative national service with the police wear [[khaki]] uniforms instead of the standard police blue.\n\n==Interdepartmental cooperation==\n\n===Bureau of Investigation===\n{{main article|Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau}}\n\n[[File:MJIB.jpg|thumb|Bureau of Investigation]]\n\nRegarding drugs, corruptions, espionage, and economic crimes, the Investigative Bureau of Ministry of Justice (MJIB) has developed stronger capability to cover cases in those categories for decades. The investigation of these cases, police corruption included, are usually transferred to or led by the Bureau of Investigation.\n\nMJIB officers are equipped with a strong laboratory-testing capacity regarding controlled substances. This gives a necessary advantage and training for the investigators of MJIB. However, the police forces in the ROC still maintain several active drug enforcement squads at the local police departments and the Criminal Investigation Bureau of NPA.\n\nHistorically, counter-intelligence affairs are under the turf of MJIB. Different from \"[[Special Branch|special branch]]\" in the [[Policing in the United Kingdom|police system in United Kingdom]], the security divisions at all levels of Taiwan police system are mainly staff units, not fielded police details. Under the supervision of [[National Security Bureau (Republic of China)|National Security Bureau]], all non-mililary cases of espionage would soon be moved to the Bureau of Investigation.\n\nA few years ago, high-ranking police officials tried to develop the strength of investigating [[white-collar crime]]s in the ROC police system but gained unnoticed progress. The MJIB is still in the lead position of cracking economic crimes or money-laundry. However, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of NPA has built fair reputation on [[copyright]] protection and the safety of computers and networks. Also, regarding the [[copyright]] issue, the 1st brigade of the 2nd special police corps is especially tasked for the enforcement related to intellectual property.\n\n=== Military Police ===\n{{main article|Republic of China Military Police}}\n[[File:ROC Military Police Headquarters Main Gate 20100718.jpg|thumb|Military Police]]\n\nIn the ROC, the usual cases for local police to bring in the military police are military deserters or traffic accidents involving military vehicles or personnel.\n\nThe latter one is a very interesting situation, in that ROC civilians tend to shake down the related military units when such kind of accidents occur. For some paranoid thinking, people in the ROC military presume that the local policemen would side with civilians. As an unofficial rule in all ROC armed forces, all military drivers, and commissioned or non-commissioned officers are frequently instructed to call in the military police when they find themselves are in the middle of such a vehicular incident.\n\nContrary to common belief, military police can actively go after civilian criminals, although usually they choose not to muddle the gray area after the lifting of martial law on 15 July 1987. According to the \"Law of the dispatching of Judicial Police Personnel,\" military police can deal with civilian affairs under the supervision of the public prosecutor(s) from all court prosecutors' offices at all levels under the Ministry of Justice. Sometimes public prosecutors will direct military police to handle large-scale searches or arrests when investigating cases of police-related crimes, prostitution, or fugitive recovery.<ref>{{cite news\n |script-title = zh:\u61b2\u8abf\u7d44 \u56db\u6708\u8d77\u4f75\u5165\u61b2\u5175\u968a\n |author       = \u8a31\u7d39\u8ed2\n |date         = 2005-02-25\n |publisher    = The Liberty Times\n |url          = http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2005/new/feb/25/today-p11.htm\n |page         = 11\n |language     = Chinese\n |accessdate   = 2007-07-18\n |url-status      = dead\n |archiveurl   = https://web.archive.org/web/20080311045332/http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2005/new/feb/25/today-p11.htm\n |archivedate  = 2008-03-11\n}}</ref>\n\nRegarding [[counter-terrorism]], there are three company-size troops of [[special forces]] under the operational control of [[ROC Ministry of National Defense|the Ministry of National Defense]]:<ref>{{cite news\n |script-title = zh:\u9678\u8ecd\u72d9\u64ca\u5175 \u795e\u7955\u66dd\u5149\n |author       = \u9673\u5b97\u9038\n |date         = 2006-10-19\n |publisher    = New Taiwan News Weekly\n |url          = http://www.newtaiwan.com.tw/bulletinview.jsp?bulletinid=64391\n |language     = Chinese\n |accessdate   = 2008-07-03\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110718161615/http://www.newtaiwan.com.tw/bulletinview.jsp?bulletinid=64391\n |archive-date = 2011-07-18\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n |script-title = zh:\u6a21\u64ec\u6a5f\u5834\u653b\u53f0 \u4e2d\u570b\u6e96\u5099\u597d\u4e86\uff1f\n |author       = \u9673\u5b97\u9038\n |date         = 2008-07-03\n |publisher    = New Taiwan News Weekly\n |url          = http://www.newtaiwan.com.tw/bulletinview.jsp?bulletinid=81113\n |language     = Chinese\n |accessdate   = 2008-07-03\n |url-status      = dead\n |archiveurl   = https://web.archive.org/web/20110718161512/http://www.newtaiwan.com.tw/bulletinview.jsp?bulletinid=81113\n |archivedate  = 2011-07-18\n}}</ref>\n* Northern Taiwan: Military Police Special Service Company ([[MPSSC]], Code Name: '''Night Hawk'''), [[Republic of China Military Police|Military Police Command]].\n* Central Taiwan: Special Warfare Special Service Company, Aviation, Airborne and Special Warfare Command of the [[Republic of China Army]].\n* Southern Taiwan: Marine Special Service Company, [[Republic of China Marine Corps|Marine Corps Command]] of the [[Republic of China Navy]].\nThese three are tasked to handle combat situations involving international terrorists, mercenary or para-military criminals. Bound by laws, currently only [[MPSSC|the Military Police Special Service Company]] can react to non-military cases, like airplane hijacking.\n\n===Coast Guard===\n{{main article|Coast Guard Administration (Taiwan)}}\n[[File:2007-11-13 Headquarters of Coast Guard Administration, Executive Yuan.jpg|thumb|Coast Guard]]\n\nThe shore lines of Taiwan are under multiple protections from several law enforcement units in Taiwan.\n\nThe history of Taiwan's [[Coast Guard Administration (Taiwan)|Coast Guard Administration]] can be traced back to several origins. One of these is the former 7th [[Special Police]] Corps, which was expanded from the late and unique River Patrol squadron of the [[Taipei County]] (now New Taipei City) Police Department. The land branches of Coast Guard Administration originate from the controversial [[Taiwan Garrison Command]], which no longer exists, but the formations of land patrol forces were inherited from the ROC Army. Because of its interesting and complicated origins, the Coast Guard Administration does not always go along well with the police, especially when problems related to legal jurisdiction on land occur.\n\nSmuggling and arms trafficking has been a long been an issue in Taiwan. Human-trafficking and its counterpart, prostitution, are increasingly serious problems in Taiwan. The maritime patrol of the Coast Guard Administration have the responsibility to stop those crimes at sea, and the coastal patrol of Coast Guard Administration are responsible for intercepting such criminal cases along the coast of Taiwan. The in-land territory of Taiwan should be the responsibility of individual local police departments or national law enforcement units from the NPA or MJIB.\n\nCases like smuggling and human-trafficking may cause turf wars between competing law enforcement agencies. In some examples, when brothels were raided by plain-clothes peace officers, the pimp would quietly go to the local police station and gather possible information about his girls in detention, but sometimes the pimp would later find that his girls were held up by the local coastal patrol units.\n\n===Fire Brigades===\n{{main article|National Fire Agency}}\n[[File:Fire engines of Fuxing Branch, Taipei City Fire Department 20100721a.jpg|thumb|Fire brigades]]\n\nTaiwan Firemen were a part of the Taiwan Police before 1995. At that time, the Fire Policemen were not the most favorite people in the eyes of certain police chiefs. The most extreme case was in [[Taipei County]] (now New Taipei City) Police Department: the [[Taipei County]] Police Commissioner Yao Kao-Chiao (\u59da\u9ad8\u6a4b) assigned all his fire policemen to kitchen duty because he felt his fire policemen were doing nothing except waiting for a fire to happen.\n\nIt is worth to point out that Yao Kao-Chiao was the Directors-General of [[Central Police University]] from May 1995 to June 1996, of National Police Agency from June 1996 to 1997, and of [[Republic of China Coast Guard|Coast Guard Administration]] from 28 January 2000 until 21 May 2000.\n\nAlso, in Taiwan, another contradiction was the radio call signs for the fire trucks or rescue vehicles. For reasons to avoid unwanted attentions and to remain secrecy, all radio call signs for all police vehicles were uncorrelated with the missions of the subject vehicles, unnecessarily including fire trucks, rescue vehicles, and ambulances of fire brigades. When fire police teams were responding to an emergency situation, these confusing call signs inevitably led to chaos and time delay. A successful fire chief, Chao Kang (\u8d99\u92fc),<ref>{{cite news\n|script-title=zh:\u5167\u653f\u90e8\u4e00\u7d1a\u4e3b\u7ba1\u5927\u642c\u98a8\n|author=\u738b\u745e\u5fb7\n|date=2002-09-14 \n|publisher=The Liberty Times\n|url=http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2002/new/sep/14/today-p4.htm\n|language=Chinese \n|accessdate=2007-07-10}}</ref> convinced the police high command to rearrange the radio call sign assignment for all fire vehicles. Chao Kang then was appointed as the Commissioner of Taiwan Provincial Fire Administration, and the Director-General of [[National Fire Agency]] from 10 September 2000 to September 2002.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ministry of the Interior (Taiwan)]]\n* [[Executive Yuan]]\n* [[Republic of China Military Police]]\n* [[Coast Guard Administration (Taiwan)]]\n* [[Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau]]\n* [[Law enforcement agency|Law Enforcement]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|National Police Agency (Republic of China)}}\n* [http://www.npa.gov.tw National Police Agency, MOI] {{in lang|zh-tw}}\n* [http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/taiwan/npa.htm National Police Administration] from GlobalSecurity.org\n\n{{police}}\n{{Asia topic|Law enforcement in}}\n[[Category:Law enforcement agencies of Taiwan]]\n[[Category:Executive Yuan]]\n[[Category:National Central Bureaus of Interpol]]\n", "name_user": "Danielt998", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up, replaced: \uff1a \u2192 :", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Police_Agency_(Taiwan)"}

It was the seventh race of the [[2001 Formula One World Championship]] and the 59th running of the [[Monaco Grand Prix|event]].  [[Michael Schumacher]] won the 78-lap race for the [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] team. His teammate [[Rubens Barrichello]] finished second with [[Jaguar Racing|Jaguar]]'s [[Eddie Irvine]] third.\n\n[[David Coulthard]], who qualified in [[pole position]] by setting the fastest lap in qualifying, [[Stall (engine)|stalled]] at the start of the [[Parade lap|formation lap]] because of an electronic [[Launch control (automotive)|launch control system]] fault, leading to Schumacher inheriting his position. Schumacher maintained the lead in the first laps with [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]] second and Barrichello third. H\u00e4kkinen responded to Schumacher's pace before he lost second to Barrichello on lap 13 because his car pulled to the right. Schumacher continued to lead until he made a [[pit stop]] on the 55th lap, relinquishing it to Barrichello for four laps. He then retook it and held it to claim his fourth victory of the season, his fifth at the Monaco Grand Prix, and the 48th of his career.\n\nAs a consequence of the race, Michael Schumacher extended his lead in the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Drivers' Championship]] from four to twelve [[List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems|points]] over Coulthard. Barrichello maintained third and [[Ralf Schumacher]] remained in fourth after he retired late in the event. In the [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|Constructors' Championship]], Ferrari extended their lead over [[McLaren]] to 32 points. [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] and [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]] kept third and fourth and [[Sauber]] maintained fifth with ten races remaining in the season.\n\n==Background==\nThe 2001 [[Monaco Grand Prix]] was the 7th of the 17 races in the [[2001 Formula One World Championship]] and the 59th edition of the event.

[[Michael Schumacher]] won the 78-lap race for the [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] team. His teammate [[Rubens Barrichello]] finished second with [[Jaguar Racing|Jaguar]]'s [[Eddie Irvine]] third.\n\n[[David Coulthard]], who qualified in [[pole position]] by setting the fastest lap in qualifying, [[Stall (engine)|stalled]] at the start of the [[Parade lap|formation lap]] because of an electronic [[Launch control (automotive)|launch control system]] fault, leading to Schumacher inheriting his position.

H\u00e4kkinen responded to Schumacher's pace before he lost second to Barrichello on lap 13 because his car pulled to the right. Schumacher continued to lead until he made a [[pit stop]] on the 55th lap, relinquishing it to Barrichello for four laps. He then retook it and held it to claim his fourth victory of the season, his fifth at the Monaco Grand Prix, and the 48th of his career.\n\nAs a consequence of the race, Michael Schumacher extended his lead in the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Drivers' Championship]] from four to twelve [[List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems|points]] over Coulthard. Barrichello maintained third and [[Ralf Schumacher]] remained in fourth after he retired late in the event.

Until the 20th century it was thought to depict [[Ludovico Sforza]], a [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]] and employer of Leonardo. During a 1904\u20131905 restoration, the removal of overpainting revealed a hand holding [[sheet music]], indicated that the sitter may be a musician.\n\nThe painting has attracted much intrigue and mystery as no contemporary records of its [[commission (art)|commission]] exist. Strong stylistic similarities to other works by Leonardo have secured him at least a partial attribution. The hesitation for a universal consensus in attribution is due to the stiff, rigid and lifeless qualities of the figure's body. While the unfinished nature of the painting may explain this, scholars believe it was likely completed by a [[Leonardeschi| student of Leonardo's]].\n\nThe portrait contains the dark background portrait typical of Leonardo's time in Milan. [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]] are other examples of this, but the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is the only one to still reside in Milan, where it has been housed at the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] since at least 1672. Over the centuries, many Italian musicians and politicians to have been proposed as the sitter. [[Franchinus Gaffurius]] was the most convincing suggestion throughout the 20th century, but scholarly opinion has shifted to [[Atalante Migliorotti]], who has been the leading candidate throughout the 21st century. Other notable suggestions include [[Josquin des Prez]] and [[Gaspar van Weerbeke]] but there is no decisive evidence to confirm any claims.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}\n\n==Description==\n===Composition===\nThis painting was made with [[oil painting|oils]] on a [[Juglans#Wood|walnut]] wood panel, a medium which Leonardo had begun to favor at the time of the painting's creation.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}} The portrait depicts a young man in a bust length, three-quarter position while his right hand holds a folded [[sheet music|musical score]] of some kind.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}} It is reminiscent of his other portraits from his time in [[Milan]], such as the [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]], from their shared black background, while also differing in the angled, rather than profile view.{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}}\n\n===The musician===\n[[File:Ritratto di musico 02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Detail of the musical score]]The man has curly shoulder length hair, sporting a red hat on his mostly finished face that intently stares at something outside the spectator's field of vision.{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=105}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}} He wears a tight white undershirt with an unfinished black [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]] and only an [[underpaint]]ed brownish-orange [[Academic stole|stole]].{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=73}}{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}} The mouth hints at the start of a smile or suggests that perhaps the man is about to sing or has just sung.{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}} A notable feature of the musician's face is the effect on his eyes from the light outside the frame. The light causes both eyes to be dilated but the left eye to a far greater extent than the right, something that is not humanly possible. Some defend Leonardo, claiming that this is simply for dramatic effect, so the viewer feels a sense of motion from the musician's left to right side of his face.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=239}}\n\n===The musical score===\nThe stiffly folded piece of paper is held in an odd and delicate manner and is at least one part of a [[sheet music|musical score]], with [[musical notes]] and letters written on it.{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} Due to the poor [[art conservation|conservation]] of the lower part of the painting, the notes and letters are largely illegible.{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=105}}{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} This has not stopped various scholars from hypothesizing as to what the letters say, often using their interpretations to support their theory of the musician's identity.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|pp=75\u201376}} The notes on the other hand have offered little clarity into the painting, other than strongly suggesting the subject to be a musician.{{sfn|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana}} The notes are also undoubtedly in measural notation and therefore likely representative of [[polyphonic music]].{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=73}} But since comparisons of Leonardo's notation of music from drawings{{#tag:ref|Drawings that are kept in the [[Royal Library, Windsor|Royal Library of Windsor]], to be exact.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}}|group=n}} does not resemble that of the painting, he is probably not the author, leaving the author and the significance of the music, unknown.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}}\n\n==History==\n===Attribution and date===\n[[File:Portrait of a Lady - Ambrogio de Predis.png|thumb|upright=1.0|''Portrait of a Lady'' by [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]]. Originally thought to also be by Leonardo and paired with ''Portrait of a Musician'']]\t\nWhile once controversial, modern scholars generally agree that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is by Leonardo da Vinci.{{sfn|Kemp|2003}}{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}}{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=105}} This controversy stemmed from the rigid and stoicness of the painting,{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} something which scholars address by proposing that the clothing and torso were done by a [[Leonardeschi| student of his]], perhaps [[Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio]] or [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]].{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=99}}{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}}{{sfn|Wallace}} But it is universally agreed that if Leonardo did not create the whole painting, then he at least painted the face.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}}\n\nWhile no recording of a [[commission (art)|commission]] exists,{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}} this attribution comes from various stylistic similarities to Leonardo's other works, notably the angel and St. Jerome's face from [[Virgin of the Rocks]] and [[Saint Jerome in the Wilderness]] respectively, as well as the portrait having hair reminiscent of that in [[Ginevra de' Benci]].{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=99}}{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}} The dark background of the portrait, a style popularized by Leonardo, furthers this attribution as it appears in other portraits from his time in Milan, such as [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]].{{sfn|Kemp|2003}} The shared quality of these portraits suggests that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' was likely done in Milan as well, meaning after 1482, the year he arrived there. Leonardo's lack of anatomical detail suggests that the Portrait of a Musician is from before 1490, the year where he would engage in a study of the [[anatomy|human body structure]], especially the [[skull]]. In fact, the later Lady with an Ermine, from 1489-1490, is representative of this refined and articulate dedication to accuracy in painting the human form, further suggesting the painting to be from before 1490. It can be further narrowed down due to the similarity in treatment of [[chiaroscuro]] from works in the mid 1840s, such [[Virgin of the Rocks]] and sketches for a [[Leonardo's horse|bronze horse sculpture]] making the painting safe to date to 1895-1890.{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=99}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}}\n\n===Ambrosiana===\nThis is Leonardo's only portrait to remain in Milan, and was catalogued into the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] in 1672. Its whereabouts before are unknown but it was listed with a description of being \"the face of the [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]], with such elegance, that perhaps the living Duke would have wanted it for himself,\" which implied the subject to be [[Ludovico Sforza]], the duke at the time.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}} The theory was that it was a counterpart to the ''Portrait of a Lady'', now attributed to [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]] but at the time was thought to be a Leonardo portrait of [[Beatrix d'Este|Beatrice d'Este]], Ludovico's wife.{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}}\n\nThese assumptions were taken without question until [[Luigi Cavenaghi]]'s 1904\u20131905 [[Conservation and restoration of paintings|restoration]] removed a layer of black paint and revealed a hand holding a [[sheet music|musical score]],{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}} which led to the identification of the subject as a musician.{{sfn|Z\u00f6llner|2015|p=45}} Since this discovery, numerous candidates have been proposed as the sitter.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}\n\n==Possible subjects==\n{{multiple image|total_width=300\n|image1=Portrait of a Youth in Profile - Francesco Napoletano.jpg\n|image2=Bust of a Youth in Profile - Leonardo da Vinci.jpg\n|footer=Two drawings, thought to depict the same person as the ''Portrait of a Musician''. Left by [[Francesco Napoletano|Napoletano]] and right by [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]].}}\nAfter [[Luigi Cavenaghi]]'s 1904\u20131905 [[Conservation and restoration of paintings|restoration]] removed a layer of black paint and revealed a hand holding a [[sheet music|musical score]],{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}} the man was widely declared to be a musician.{{sfn|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana}}{{sfn|Z\u00f6llner|2015|p=45}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} While the subject's identity is uncertain, the subject himself may appear in other works. Scholars at the [[National Gallery]] have suggested that [[Francesco Napoletano]]'s drawing of ''Portrait of a Youth in Profile'' and Leonardo's drawing of a ''Bust of a Youth in Profile'' depict the same figure as the ''Portrait of a Musician''.{{sfn|National Gallery|2011|p=5}} However the identity of the sitter himself remains unknown and not only have various candidates been proposed but even the idea that the subject is simply anonymous has also been explored.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}\n\n===Franchinus Gaffurius===\nThroughout the 20th century, the leading candidate, suggested by [[Luca Beltrami]] in 1906, was [[Franchinus Gaffurius]], a priest, music theorist and  court musician for [[Ludovico Sforza]] and ''[[maestro di cappella]]'' of [[Milan Cathedral]].{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}} Gaffurius and Leonardo were known to have been friends, both entering the Duke's service only a year or two apart from each other. In fact, Gaffurius' celebrated 1496 music treatise, ''Practica Musica'', contains various [[woodcuts]] by Leonardo.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=31}} Additionally, the letters \"Cant\" and \"Ang\" have been deciphered on the sheet music which could by an abbreviation for Cantum Angelicum. This may be to be in reference to ''Angelicum ac divinum opus'', a music treatise published in 1508.{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}}\n\n<imagemap>\nImage:Portrait of a Musician Candidates.jpg|thumb|left|alt=''Portrait of a Musician'' and four proposed candidates of the subject.|Sforza, Gaffurius, Josquin and Galeazzo.{{#tag:ref|This portrait, by [[Andrea Solari]], has often been suggested to be [[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin|Galeazzo di Sanseverino]], another candidate for the sitter in Leonardo's painting.{{sfn|Shephard|2019}}|group=n}} (Left to right, ''Portrait of a Musician'' center) have each been proposed as the subject. <small>''(Clickable image\u2014use cursor to identify.)''</small>\npoly 10 10 218 10 218 192 150 192 149 278 10 278 [[Ludovico Sforza]]\npoly 220 10 424 10 424 278 284 278 284 192 220 192 [[Franchinus Gaffurius]]\nrect 150 192 284 372[[Portrait of a Musician]]\npoly 10 282 149 282 149 380 218 380 218 554 10 554 [[Josquin des Prez]]\npoly 284 282 424 282 424 554 220 554 220 380 284 372 [[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin]]\n</imagemap>\nThe issues that have since discredited this theory are the treatise being published at least 18 years after the painting's creation and no physical descriptions from Gaffurius' lifetime matching the ''Portrait of a Musician.''{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Also, the issues of Gaffurius, a priest, not being depicted in [[Clerical clothing|clerical robe]] and that Gaffurius would have been in his mid thirties at the time, make him likely too old to be the young man of the painting.{{sfn|Blackburn|2001}}{{sfn|Pooler|2014|pp=31\u201332}}\n\n===Atalante Migliorotti===\nSince Pietro C. Marani's theory in 2000,{{sfn|Marani|2000|p=165}} [[Atalante Migliorotti]], a [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] [[lute|lutist]], actor, lyricist and singer, has been the most widely accepted identity of the musician.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}} In 1482, Migliarotti and Leonardo left [[Florence]] together for [[Milan]] to serve in the court of [[Ludovico Sforza]], the [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]].{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}} Furthermore, Leonardo is thought to have taught Migliarotti the [[lute]] and [[lyre]] and known to be friends.{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}}{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}{{sfn|Harr\u00e1n|2001}} During the painting's conception, Migliarotti would have been in his late teens or early twenties, making him a fitting candidate to be the young man in the painting.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Additionally, in a 1482 inventory from the [[Codex Atlanticus]]{{#tag:ref|Folio 888 recto (ex 324 recto) to be exact.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}|group=n}} Leonardo listed \"a portrait of Atalante with his face raised.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}{{#tag:ref|Alternatively translated as: \"a portrait of Atalante with his upturned face.\"{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|pp=75\u201376}} or \"a head portrayed from Atalante who raises his face.\"{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}}|group=n}} This has been considered by many to have been some kind of study or start of the later ''Portrait of a Musician''.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}\n\nThe only issues with this theory are that the subject's face is not raised, as Leonardo wrote in his notes, and this note was written 3 years prior to the earliest estimated date of completion{{#tag:ref|The earliest being 1485 with the latest at 1490.{{sfn|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana}}{{sfn|Syson|2011}}{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}}|group=n}} for the ''Portrait of a Musician''.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}} However, these are by no means outstanding issues, as Leonardo was known to make numerous revisions and often took many years to complete a painting.{{sfn|Kalb|2019}}{{sfn|Selvaggio|2018}}{{#tag:ref|Often, like ''The Portrait of a Musician'', not even finishing his paintings.{{sfn|Cotter|2019}}|group=n}} Therefore, since the widespread rejection of Franchinus Gaffurius as the leading candidate, Migliarotti is now considered the most likely.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}{{sfn|Blackburn|2001}}\n\n===Josquin des Prez===\nIn 1972, [[Josquin des Prez]], French singer and composer, was suggested as the subject by [[Belgian]] musicologist, Suzanne Clercx-Lejeune.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Josquin worked in the service of the [[House of Sforza|Sforza family]] during various periods of the 1480s,{{sfn|Macey|2001}} consequently working at the same time as Leonardo.{{sfn|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana}} Suzanne Clercx-Lejeune proposed that the words on the [[sheet music|musical score]] where the abbreviations of \"Cont,\" \"Cantuz,\" and \"A Z\" appear in reference to the words \"[[Contratenor]],\" \"Cantuz\" and [[Alto|Altuz]]. She claimed that this meant they were associated with a song with a descending melodic line, such as [[Mass (music)|masses]], [[motets]] and songs by Josquin.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}{{#tag:ref|With Josquin's motet ''Illibata Dei Virgo nutrix'' suggested as a piece that exemplifies this.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}|group=n}}\n\nThis theory has been strongly discredited as the notation in the painting being largely illegible, while many composers of the time were writing the same forms in this manner.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Additionally, this theory runs into the same issues as those of Gaffurius', in that Josquin was also a priest in his mid 30s at the time, making the young man depicted without [[Clerical clothing|clerical robes]] unlikely to be Josquin.{{sfn|Macey|2001}}\n\n===Gaspar van Weerbeke===\nLaure Fagnart suggested in 2019 that the sitter's identity is [[Gaspar van Weerbeke]], a [[Netherlandish]] composer and singer. Gaspar worked for the [[House of Sforza|Sforza family]] at the same time as Leonardo, and they where likely knew each other due to their shared employer.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}} This theory cites letters from [[Galeazzo Maria Sforza]] to Gotardo Panigarola concerning the attire of musicians for the court, with one stating, \"Gotardo. To Gaspar, our singer, we would like to give a dark velvet robe, such as you have given to the Abbot [Antonio Guinati] and to Cordier, both of them also our sing-ers.\" As Fagnart points out, this letter is too vague to defiantly link Gaspar to the portrait, additionally, Gaspar runs into the same issue as Gaffurius and Josquin, as he would have also been in his 30s and probably too old to be the young man in the painting.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}\n\n===Others===\n[[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin]] has been suggested as the sitter, since Leonardo lived with him while in Milan. Not only is there no direct evidence to support this, but the uncovering of the musical score makes this very unlikely as Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin was not known to be a musician.{{sfn|Shephard|2019}} [[Francesco Canova da Milano]], an Italian [[lute]]nist and composer, has also been suggested as the subject since he was an important musician also working in [[Milan]] when Leonardo was there.{{sfn|Wallace}} However, there is no strong evidence to support this claim.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}{{sfn|Wallace}} The a Dutch illustrator [[Siegfried Woldhek]]  proposed that ''Portrait of a Musician'' is one of three self portraits by Leonardo, {{sfn|Woldhek|2008}} although this theory is considered highly improbable.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}\n\n==Interpretation==\nGiven the lack of contemporary records, scholars have proposed various theories. A number believed that the tension in the subject's face is due to intense thought on music that was either just performed, about to be performed or being performed.{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} The painting has also been proposed as representative of Leonardo's self proclaimed ideology in the superiority of painting over other art forms like [[poetry]], [[sculpture]] and [[music]].{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=77}} Leonardo famously declared in the beginning of his uncompleted ''[[A Treatise on Painting|Libro de pittura]]'', \n\n{{Quote\n|text=How Music Ought to be Called the Sister and Junior to Painting. Music is to be re-garded none other than the sitter of painting since it is subject to hearing, a sense second to the eye, and since it composes harmony from the conjunction of its proportional parts operating at the same time. [These parts] are constrained to arise and to die in one or more harmonic tempos which surround a proportionality by its members; such a har-mony is composed not differently from the circumferential lines which generate human beauty by its [respective] members. Yet painting excels and rules over music, because it does not immediately die after its creation the way unfortunately music does. To the contrary, painting stays in existence, and will show you as being alive what is, in fact, on a single surface. \n|author=Leonardo da Vinci\n|source=''[[A Treatise on Painting]]'' (1490-92)\n}}\n\nThese words seemingly disapprove of music for its ephemeral nature, and positions painting as having a materiel, permanent physical quality. This theory suggests that the sadness in the young man's eyes is due to this proposed idea that music simply disappears after a finished performance.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=77}}\n\nAnother interpretation is that Leonardo was simply moved to depict the a young man's beauty and curly hair.

Until the 20th century it was thought to depict [[Ludovico Sforza]], a [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]] and employer of Leonardo. During a 1904\u20131905 restoration, the removal of overpainting revealed a hand holding [[sheet music]], indicated that the sitter may be a musician.\n\nThe painting has attracted much intrigue and mystery as no contemporary records of its [[commission (art)|commission]] exist. Strong stylistic similarities to other works by Leonardo have secured him at least a partial attribution. The hesitation for a universal consensus in attribution is due to the stiff, rigid and lifeless qualities of the figure's body. While the unfinished nature of the painting may explain this, scholars believe it was likely completed by a [[Leonardeschi| student of Leonardo's]].\n\nThe portrait contains the dark background portrait typical of Leonardo's time in Milan. [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]] are other examples of this, but the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is the only one to still reside in Milan, where it has been housed at the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] since at least 1672. Over the centuries, many Italian musicians and politicians to have been proposed as the sitter. [[Franchinus Gaffurius]] was the most convincing suggestion throughout the 20th century, but scholarly opinion has shifted to [[Atalante Migliorotti]], who has been the leading candidate throughout the 21st century. Other notable suggestions include [[Josquin des Prez]] and [[Gaspar van Weerbeke]] but there is no decisive evidence to confirm any claims.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}\n\n==Description==\n===Composition===\nThis painting was made with [[oil painting|oils]] on a [[Juglans#Wood|walnut]] wood panel, a medium which Leonardo had begun to favor at the time of the painting's creation.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}} The portrait depicts a young man in a bust length, three-quarter position while his right hand holds a folded [[sheet music|musical score]] of some kind.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}} It is reminiscent of his other portraits from his time in [[Milan]], such as the [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]], from their shared black background, while also differing in the angled, rather than profile view.{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}}\n\n===The musician===\n[[File:Ritratto di musico 02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Detail of the musical score]]The man has curly shoulder length hair, sporting a red hat on his mostly finished face that intently stares at something outside the spectator's field of vision.{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=105}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}} He wears a tight white undershirt with an unfinished black [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]] and only an [[underpaint]]ed brownish-orange [[Academic stole|stole]].{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=73}}{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}} The mouth hints at the start of a smile or suggests that perhaps the man is about to sing or has just sung.{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}} A notable feature of the musician's face is the effect on his eyes from the light outside the frame. The light causes both eyes to be dilated but the left eye to a far greater extent than the right, something that is not humanly possible. Some defend Leonardo, claiming that this is simply for dramatic effect, so the viewer feels a sense of motion from the musician's left to right side of his face.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=239}}\n\n===The musical score===\nThe stiffly folded piece of paper is held in an odd and delicate manner and is at least one part of a [[sheet music|musical score]], with [[musical notes]] and letters written on it.{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} Due to the poor [[art conservation|conservation]] of the lower part of the painting, the notes and letters are largely illegible.{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=105}}{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} This has not stopped various scholars from hypothesizing as to what the letters say, often using their interpretations to support their theory of the musician's identity.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|pp=75\u201376}} The notes on the other hand have offered little clarity into the painting, other than strongly suggesting the subject to be a musician.{{sfn|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana}} The notes are also undoubtedly in measural notation and therefore likely representative of [[polyphonic music]].{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=73}} But since comparisons of Leonardo's notation of music from drawings{{#tag:ref|Drawings that are kept in the [[Royal Library, Windsor|Royal Library of Windsor]], to be exact.|group=n}} does not resemble that of the painting, he is probably not the author, leaving the author and the significance of the music, unknown.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}}\n\n==History==\n===Attribution and date===\n[[File:Portrait of a Lady - Ambrogio de Predis.png|thumb|upright=1.0|''Portrait of a Lady'' by [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]]. Originally thought to also be by Leonardo and paired with ''Portrait of a Musician'']]\t\nWhile once controversial, modern scholars generally agree that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is by Leonardo da Vinci.{{sfn|Kemp|2003}}{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}}{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=105}} This controversy stemmed from the rigid and stoicness of the painting,{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} something which scholars address by proposing that the clothing and torso were done by a [[Leonardeschi| student of his]], perhaps [[Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio]] or [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]].{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=99}}{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}}{{sfn|Wallace}} But it is universally agreed that if Leonardo did not create the whole painting, then he at least painted the face.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}}\n\nWhile no recording of a [[commission (art)|commission]] exists,{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}} this attribution comes from various stylistic similarities to Leonardo's other works, notably the angel and St. Jerome's face from [[Virgin of the Rocks]] and [[Saint Jerome in the Wilderness]] respectively, as well as the portrait having hair reminiscent of that in [[Ginevra de' Benci]].{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=99}}{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}} The dark background of the portrait, a style popularized by Leonardo, furthers this attribution as it appears in other portraits from his time in Milan, such as [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]].{{sfn|Kemp|2003}} The shared quality of these portraits suggests that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' was likely done in Milan as well, meaning after 1482, the year he arrived there. Leonardo's lack of anatomical detail suggests that the Portrait of a Musician is from before 1490, the year where he would engage in a study of the [[anatomy|human body structure]], especially the [[skull]]. In fact, the later Lady with an Ermine, from 1489-1490, is representative of this refined and articulate dedication to accuracy in painting the human form, further suggesting the painting to be from before 1490. It can be further narrowed down due to the similarity in treatment of [[chiaroscuro]] from works in the mid 1840s, such [[Virgin of the Rocks]] and sketches for a [[Leonardo's horse|bronze horse sculpture]] making the painting safe to date to 1895-1890.{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=99}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}}\n\n===Ambrosiana===\nThis is Leonardo's only portrait to remain in Milan, and was catalogued into the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] in 1672. Its whereabouts before are unknown but it was listed with a description of being \"the face of the [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]], with such elegance, that perhaps the living Duke would have wanted it for himself,\" which implied the subject to be [[Ludovico Sforza]], the duke at the time.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}} The theory was that it was a counterpart to the ''Portrait of a Lady'', now attributed to [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]] but at the time was thought to be a Leonardo portrait of [[Beatrix d'Este|Beatrice d'Este]], Ludovico's wife.{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}}\n\nThese assumptions were taken without question until [[Luigi Cavenaghi]]'s 1904\u20131905 [[Conservation and restoration of paintings|restoration]] removed a layer of black paint and revealed a hand holding a [[sheet music|musical score]],{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}} which led to the identification of the subject as a musician.{{sfn|Z\u00f6llner|2015|p=45}} Since this discovery, numerous candidates have been proposed as the sitter.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}\n\n==Possible subjects==\n{{multiple image|total_width=300\n|image1=Portrait of a Youth in Profile - Francesco Napoletano.jpg\n|image2=Bust of a Youth in Profile - Leonardo da Vinci.jpg\n|footer=Two drawings, thought to depict the same person as the ''Portrait of a Musician''. Left by [[Francesco Napoletano|Napoletano]] and right by [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]].}}\nAfter [[Luigi Cavenaghi]]'s 1904\u20131905 [[Conservation and restoration of paintings|restoration]] removed a layer of black paint and revealed a hand holding a [[sheet music|musical score]],{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}} the man was widely declared to be a musician.{{sfn|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana}}{{sfn|Z\u00f6llner|2015|p=45}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} While the subject's identity is uncertain, the subject himself may appear in other works. Scholars at the [[National Gallery]] have suggested that [[Francesco Napoletano]]'s drawing of ''Portrait of a Youth in Profile'' and Leonardo's drawing of a ''Bust of a Youth in Profile'' depict the same figure as the ''Portrait of a Musician''.{{sfn|National Gallery|2011|p=5}} However the identity of the sitter himself remains unknown and not only have various candidates been proposed but even the idea that the subject is simply anonymous has also been explored.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}\n\n===Franchinus Gaffurius===\nThroughout the 20th century, the leading candidate, suggested by [[Luca Beltrami]] in 1906, was [[Franchinus Gaffurius]], a priest, music theorist and  court musician for [[Ludovico Sforza]] and ''[[maestro di cappella]]'' of [[Milan Cathedral]].{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}} Gaffurius and Leonardo were known to have been friends, both entering the Duke's service only a year or two apart from each other. In fact, Gaffurius' celebrated 1496 music treatise, ''Practica Musica'', contains various [[woodcuts]] by Leonardo.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=31}} Additionally, the letters \"Cant\" and \"Ang\" have been deciphered on the sheet music which could by an abbreviation for Cantum Angelicum. This may be to be in reference to ''Angelicum ac divinum opus'', a music treatise published in 1508.{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}}\n\n<imagemap>\nImage:Portrait of a Musician Candidates.jpg|thumb|left|alt=''Portrait of a Musician'' and four proposed candidates of the subject.|Sforza, Gaffurius, Josquin and Galeazzo.{{#tag:ref|This portrait, by [[Andrea Solari]], has often been suggested to be [[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin|Galeazzo di Sanseverino]], another candidate for the sitter in Leonardo's painting.|group=n}} (Left to right, ''Portrait of a Musician'' center) have each been proposed as the subject. <small>''(Clickable image\u2014use cursor to identify.)''</small>\npoly 10 10 218 10 218 192 150 192 149 278 10 278 [[Ludovico Sforza]]\npoly 220 10 424 10 424 278 284 278 284 192 220 192 [[Franchinus Gaffurius]]\nrect 150 192 284 372[[Portrait of a Musician]]\npoly 10 282 149 282 149 380 218 380 218 554 10 554 [[Josquin des Prez]]\npoly 284 282 424 282 424 554 220 554 220 380 284 372 [[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin]]\n</imagemap>\nThe issues that have since discredited this theory are the treatise being published at least 18 years after the painting's creation and no physical descriptions from Gaffurius' lifetime matching the ''Portrait of a Musician.''{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Also, the issues of Gaffurius, a priest, not being depicted in [[Clerical clothing|clerical robe]] and that Gaffurius would have been in his mid thirties at the time, make him likely too old to be the young man of the painting.{{sfn|Blackburn|2001}}{{sfn|Pooler|2014|pp=31\u201332}}\n\n===Atalante Migliorotti===\nSince Pietro C. Marani's theory in 2000,{{sfn|Marani|2000|p=165}} [[Atalante Migliorotti]], a [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] [[lute|lutist]], actor, lyricist and singer, has been the most widely accepted identity of the musician.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}} In 1482, Migliarotti and Leonardo left [[Florence]] together for [[Milan]] to serve in the court of [[Ludovico Sforza]], the [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]].{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}} Furthermore, Leonardo is thought to have taught Migliarotti the [[lute]] and [[lyre]] and known to be friends.{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}}{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}{{sfn|Harr\u00e1n|2001}}{{#tag:ref|This was claimed by [[Anonimo Gaddiano]], one of the earliest biographers of Leonardo Da Vinci.|group=n}} During the painting's conception, Migliarotti would have been in his late teens or early twenties{{#tag:ref|His age being 19\u201324 depending on the accepted year as 1485\u20131490.|group=n}} making him a fitting candidate to be the young man in the painting.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Additionally, in a 1482 inventory from the [[Codex Atlanticus]]{{#tag:ref|Folio 888 recto (ex 324 recto) to be exact.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}|group=n}} Leonardo listed \"a portrait of Atalante with his face raised.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}{{#tag:ref|Alternatively translated as: \"a portrait of Atalante with his upturned face.\"{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|pp=75\u201376}} or \"a head portrayed from Atalante who raises his face.\"{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}}|group=n}} This has been considered by many to have been some kind of study or start of the later ''Portrait of a Musician''.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}\n\nThe only issues with this theory are that the subject's face is not raised, as Leonardo wrote in his notes, and this note was written 3 years prior to the earliest estimated date of completion{{#tag:ref|The earliest being 1485 with the latest at 1490.|group=n}} for the ''Portrait of a Musician''.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}} However, these are by no means outstanding issues, as Leonardo was known to make numerous revisions and often took many years to complete a painting.{{sfn|Kalb|2019}}{{sfn|Selvaggio|2018}}{{#tag:ref|Often, like ''The Portrait of a Musician'', not even finishing his paintings.{{sfn|Cotter|2019}}|group=n}} Therefore, since the widespread rejection of Franchinus Gaffurius as the leading candidate, Migliarotti is now considered the most likely.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}{{sfn|Blackburn|2001}}\n\n===Josquin des Prez===\nIn 1972, [[Josquin des Prez]], French singer and composer, was suggested as the subject by [[Belgian]] musicologist, Suzanne Clercx-Lejeune.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Josquin worked in the service of the [[House of Sforza|Sforza family]] during various periods of the 1480s,{{sfn|Macey|2001}} consequently working at the same time as Leonardo.{{sfn|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana}} Suzanne Clercx-Lejeune proposed that the words on the [[sheet music|musical score]] where the abbreviations of \"Cont,\" \"Cantuz,\" and \"A Z\" appear in reference to the words \"[[Contratenor]],\" \"Cantuz\" and [[Alto|Altuz]]. She claimed that this meant they were associated with a song with a descending melodic line, such as [[Mass (music)|masses]], [[motets]] and songs by Josquin.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}{{#tag:ref|With Josquin's motet ''Illibata Dei Virgo nutrix'' suggested as a piece that exemplifies this.|group=n}}\n\nThis theory has been strongly discredited as the notation in the painting being largely illegible, while many composers of the time were writing the same forms in this manner.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Additionally, this theory runs into the same issues as those of Gaffurius', in that Josquin was also a priest in his mid 30s at the time, making the young man depicted without [[Clerical clothing|clerical robes]] unlikely to be Josquin.{{sfn|Macey|2001}}\n\n===Gaspar van Weerbeke===\nLaure Fagnart suggested in 2019 that the sitter's identity is [[Gaspar van Weerbeke]], a [[Netherlandish]] composer and singer. Gaspar worked for the [[House of Sforza|Sforza family]] at the same time as Leonardo, and they where likely knew each other due to their shared employer.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}} This theory cites letters from [[Galeazzo Maria Sforza]] to Gotardo Panigarola concerning the attire of musicians for the court, with one stating, \"Gotardo. To Gaspar, our singer, we would like to give a dark velvet robe, such as you have given to the Abbot [Antonio Guinati] and to Cordier, both of them also our sing-ers.\" As Fagnart points out, this letter is too vague to defiantly link Gaspar to the portrait, additionally, Gaspar runs into the same issue as Gaffurius and Josquin, as he would have also been in his 30s and probably too old to be the young man in the painting.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}\n\n===Others===\n[[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin]] has been suggested as the sitter, since Leonardo lived with him while in Milan. Not only is there no direct evidence to support this, but the uncovering of the musical score makes this very unlikely as Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin was not known to be a musician.{{sfn|Shephard|2019}} [[Francesco Canova da Milano]], an Italian [[lute]]nist and composer, has also been suggested as the subject since he was an important musician also working in [[Milan]] when Leonardo was there.{{sfn|Wallace}} However, there is no strong evidence to support this claim.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}{{sfn|Wallace}} The a Dutch illustrator [[Siegfried Woldhek]]  proposed that ''Portrait of a Musician'' is one of three self portraits by Leonardo, {{sfn|Woldhek|2008}} although this theory is considered highly improbable.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}\n\n==Interpretation==\nGiven the lack of contemporary records, scholars have proposed various theories. A number believed that the tension in the subject's face is due to intense thought on music that was either just performed, about to be performed or being performed.{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} The painting has also been proposed as representative of Leonardo's self proclaimed ideology in the superiority of painting over other art forms like [[poetry]], [[sculpture]] and [[music]].{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=77}} Leonardo famously declared in the beginning of his uncompleted ''[[A Treatise on Painting|Libro de pittura]]'', \n\n{{Quote\n|text=How Music Ought to be Called the Sister and Junior to Painting. Music is to be re-garded none other than the sitter of painting since it is subject to hearing, a sense second to the eye, and since it composes harmony from the conjunction of its proportional parts operating at the same time. [These parts] are constrained to arise and to die in one or more harmonic tempos which surround a proportionality by its members; such a har-mony is composed not differently from the circumferential lines which generate human beauty by its [respective] members. Yet painting excels and rules over music, because it does not immediately die after its creation the way unfortunately music does. To the contrary, painting stays in existence, and will show you as being alive what is, in fact, on a single surface. \n|author=Leonardo da Vinci\n|source=''[[A Treatise on Painting]]'' (1490-92)\n}}\n\nThese words seemingly disapprove of music for its ephemeral nature, and positions painting as having a materiel, permanent physical quality. This theory suggests that the sadness in the young man's eyes is due to this proposed idea that music simply disappears after a finished performance.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=77}}\n\nAnother interpretation is that Leonardo was simply moved to depict the a young man's beauty and curly hair. But more likely, due to the odd and seemingly intimate aesthetic of the painting, is that it was a personal gift for a close friend.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} This would fit with a lot of the proposed subjects, especially [[Atalante Migliorotti]], a close friend of Leonardo's and one likely not financially able to commission a portrait himself.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=n|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''Books'''\n*{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=Kenneth |authorlink1=Kenneth Clark |last2=Kemp |first2=Martin |authorlink2=Martin Kemp (art historian) |year=1989\n |title=Leonardo da Vinci: Revised Edition |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]] |language=English |location=City of Westminster, London, England |isbn=978-0140169829 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fXifCgAAQBAJ&lpg=PR99&dq=martin%20kemp%20%22portrait%20of%20a%20musician%22&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false |ref={{sfnRef|Clark|1989}}}}\n\n*{{cite book |last=Fagnart |first=Laure |editor-last1=Lindmayr-Brandl |editor-first1=Andrea |editor-last2=Kolb |editor-first2=Paul |year=2019\n |chapter=Gaspar Depicted?
