Mapping of variation over an area is valuable in detecting structures obscured by overlying material. The magnetic variation in successive bands of ocean floor parallel with [[mid-ocean ridge]]s is important evidence supporting the theory of [[seafloor spreading]], central to [[plate tectonics]].\n\n==Measurement==\nMagnetic anomalies are generally  a small fraction of the magnetic field.

On land, it is often oriented vertically, while in aircraft, ships and satellites it is usually oriented so the axis is in the direction of the field. It measures the magnetic field continuously, but drifts over time. One way to correct for drift is to take repeated measurements at the same place during the survey.<ref name=Mussett/>{{rp|163\u2013165}}<ref name=Telford/>{{rp|75\u201377}}\n# The [[proton precession magnetometer]] measures the strength of the field but not its direction, so it does not need to be oriented.

They are used on satellites and in most [[aeromagnetic survey]]s.<ref name=Telford/>{{rp|78\u201379}}\n\n==Data acquisition==\n\n===Ground-based===\nIn ground-based surveys, measurements are made at a series of stations, typically 15 to 60&nbsp;m apart. Usually a proton precession magnetometer is used and it is often mounted on a pole. Raising the magnetometer reduces the influence of small ferrous objects that were discarded by humans. To further reduce unwanted signals, they do not carry objects such as keys, knives or compasses. In addition, objects such as motor vehicles, railway lines, and barbed wire fences are avoided. If some such contaminant is overlooked, it often shows up as a sharp spike in the anomaly, so such features are treated with suspicion. The main application for ground-based surveys is detailed search for minerals.<ref name=Mussett/>{{rp|163}}<ref name=Telford/>{{rp|83&ndash;84}}\n\n[[File:Novatem CGJDD.jpg|thumb]]\n===Aeromagnetic===\n{{Main|Aeromagnetic survey}}\n\nAirborne magnetic surveys are often used in oil surveys to provide preliminary information for seismic surveys. In some countries such as Canada, government agencies have made systematic surveys of large areas. The survey generally involves making a series of parallel runs at a constant height and intervals of anywhere from a hundred meters to several kilometers. These are crossed by occasional tie lines, perpendicular to the main survey, to check for errors. The plane is a source of magnetism, so sensors are either mounted on a boom (as in the figure) or towed behind on a cable. Aeromagnetic surveys have a lower spatial resolution of ground surveys, but this can be an advantage for a regional survey of deeper rocks.<ref name=Mussett/>{{rp|166}}<ref name=Telford/>{{rp|81&ndash;83}}\n\n===Shipborne===\nIn shipborne surveys, a magnetometer is towed a few hundred meters behind a ship in a device called a ''fish''. The sensor is kept at a constant depth of about 15&nbsp;m. Otherwise, the procedure is similar to that used in aeromagnetic surveys.<ref name=Mussett/>{{rp|167}}<ref name=Telford/>{{rp|83}}\n\n===Spacecraft===\nThe [[Sputnik 3]] spacecraft in 1958 was the first to carry a magnetometer.<ref name=\"Dicati\">{{cite book|last1=Dicati|first1=Renato|title=Stamping the Earth from Space|date=2017|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319207568}}</ref>{{rp|155}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Purucker|first=Michael E.|last2=Whaler|first2=Kathryn A. |chapter=6.

The first is remove short-term variations in the field from external sources. There are ''diurnal variations'' that have a period of 24&nbsp;hours and magnitudes of up to 30&nbsp;nT, probably from the action of the [[solar wind]] on the [[ionosphere]].<ref name=Telford/>{{rp|72}} In addition, [[magnetic storm]]s can have peak magnitudes of 1000&nbsp;nT and can last for several days. Their contribution can be measured by returning to a base station repeatedly or by having another magnetometer that periodically measures the field at a fixed location.<ref name=Mussett/>{{rp|167}}\n\nThe anomaly is the local contribution to the magnetic field, so the main geomagnetic field must be subtracted from it. Usually the [[International Geomagnetic Reference Field]] is used for this purpose. This is a large-scale, time-averaged mathematical model of the Earth's field based on measurements from satellites, magnetic observatories and other surveys.<ref name=Mussett/>{{rp|167}}\n\nSome corrections that are needed for [[gravity anomaly|gravity anomalies]] are less important for magnetic anomalies.

Mapping of variation over an area is valuable in detecting structures obscured by overlying material. The magnetic variation in successive bands of ocean floor parallel with [[mid-ocean ridge]]s is important evidence supporting the theory of [[seafloor spreading]], central to [[plate tectonics]].\n\n==Measurement==\nMagnetic anomalies are generally  a small fraction of the magnetic field.

On land, it is often oriented vertically, while in aircraft, ships and satellites it is usually oriented so the axis is in the direction of the field. It measures the magnetic field continuously, but drifts over time. One way to correct for drift is to take repeated measurements at the same place during the survey.<ref name=Mussett/>{{rp|163\u2013165}}<ref name=Telford/>{{rp|75\u201377}}\n# The [[proton precession magnetometer]] measures the strength of the field but not its direction, so it does not need to be oriented.

They are used on satellites and in most [[aeromagnetic survey]]s.<ref name=Telford/>{{rp|78\u201379}}\n\n==Data acquisition==\n\n===Ground-based===\nIn ground-based surveys, measurements are made at a series of stations, typically 15 to 60&nbsp;m apart. Usually a proton precession magnetometer is used and it is often mounted on a pole. Raising the magnetometer reduces the influence of small ferrous objects that were discarded by humans. To further reduce unwanted signals, they do not carry objects such as keys, knives or compasses. In addition, objects such as motor vehicles, railway lines, and barbed wire fences are avoided. If some such contaminant is overlooked, it often shows up as a sharp spike in the anomaly, so such features are treated with suspicion. The main application for ground-based surveys is detailed search for minerals.<ref name=Mussett/>{{rp|163}}<ref name=Telford/>{{rp|83&ndash;84}}\n\n[[File:Novatem CGJDD.jpg|thumb]]\n===Aeromagnetic===\n{{Main|Aeromagnetic survey}}\n\nAirborne magnetic surveys are often used in oil surveys to provide preliminary information for seismic surveys. In some countries such as Canada, government agencies have made systematic surveys of large areas. The survey generally involves making a series of parallel runs at a constant height and intervals of anywhere from a hundred meters to several kilometers. These are crossed by occasional tie lines, perpendicular to the main survey, to check for errors. The plane is a source of magnetism, so sensors are either mounted on a boom (as in the figure) or towed behind on a cable. Aeromagnetic surveys have a lower spatial resolution of ground surveys, but this can be an advantage for a regional survey of deeper rocks.<ref name=Mussett/>{{rp|166}}<ref name=Telford/>{{rp|81&ndash;83}}\n\n===Shipborne===\nIn shipborne surveys, a magnetometer is towed a few hundred meters behind a ship in a device called a ''fish''. The sensor is kept at a constant depth of about 15&nbsp;m. Otherwise, the procedure is similar to that used in aeromagnetic surveys.<ref name=Mussett/>{{rp|167}}<ref name=Telford/>{{rp|83}}\n\n===Spacecraft===\nThe [[Sputnik 3]] spacecraft in 1958 was the first to carry a magnetometer.<ref name=\"Dicati\">{{cite book|last1=Dicati|first1=Renato|title=Stamping the Earth from Space|date=2017|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319207568}}</ref>{{rp|155}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Purucker|first=Michael E.|last2=Whaler|first2=Kathryn A. |chapter=6.

The first is remove short-term variations in the field from external sources. There are ''diurnal variations'' that have a period of 24&nbsp;hours and magnitudes of up to 30&nbsp;nT, probably from the action of the [[solar wind]] on the [[ionosphere]].<ref name=Telford/>{{rp|72}} In addition, [[magnetic storm]]s can have peak magnitudes of 1000&nbsp;nT and can last for several days. Their contribution can be measured by returning to a base station repeatedly or by having another magnetometer that periodically measures the field at a fixed location.<ref name=Mussett/>{{rp|167}}\n\nThe anomaly is the local contribution to the magnetic field, so the main geomagnetic field must be subtracted from it. Usually the [[International Geomagnetic Reference Field]] is used for this purpose. This is a large-scale, time-averaged mathematical model of the Earth's field based on measurements from satellites, magnetic observatories and other surveys.<ref name=Mussett/>{{rp|167}}\n\nSome corrections that are needed for [[gravity anomaly|gravity anomalies]] are less important for magnetic anomalies.
