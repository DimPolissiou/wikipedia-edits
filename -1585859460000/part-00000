As a sign of the growing strength of the electronic media sector, GEO TV is planning to start an additional 10 channels and for this purpose is setting up a {{convert|50|acre|m2|sing=on}} studio in the city.\n\n==Karachi Stock Exchange==\n[[Karachi Stock Exchange]] is Pakistan's largest and oldest stock exchange, with many Pakistani as well as overseas listings. In 2002, it was declared the \u201cBest Performing Stock Market of the World for the year 2002\u201d{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Pakistan ranked third in 2014.

Other industrial zones are located in Landhi, Korangi, FB Area, North Karachi and Port Qasim.\n\nKarachi is also home of major [[automobile]] manufacturing companies. [[Toyota]] is in the process of increasing production capacity to over 120,000 units per annum. [[Suzuki]] Motor Company is also located in Karachi. The manufacturing plant located in Bin Qasim has a production capacity of 150,000 vehicles per year. Among others, Millat Tractors, [[Daihatsu]], HinoPak Buses and Trucks manufacturing plants are also located in Karachi. The now-defunct [[Adam Motor Company]] was formerly located in the city.\n\nWork is being done to promote the development of higher value added textile products, most notably by [[Ayesha Tammy Haq]], an attorney who also has a television talk show.

As a sign of the growing strength of the electronic media sector, GEO TV is planning to start an additional 10 channels and for this purpose is setting up a {{convert|50|acre|m2|sing=on}} studio in the city.\n\n==Karachi Stock Exchange==\n[[Karachi Stock Exchange]] is Pakistan's largest and oldest stock exchange, with many Pakistani as well as overseas listings. In 2002, it was declared the \u201cBest Performing Stock Market of the World for the year 2002\u201d{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Pakistan ranked third in 2014.

An [[Exhibition|expo center]] has also been set up in Karachi, which hosts many regional and international exhibitions including the [[International Defence Exhibition and Seminar|IDEAS]] Defence Exhibition.

Other industrial zones are located in Landhi, Korangi, FB Area, North Karachi and Port Qasim.\n\nKarachi is also home of major [[automobile]] manufacturing companies. [[Toyota]] is in the process of increasing production capacity to over 120,000 units per annum. [[Suzuki]] Motor Company is also located in Karachi. The manufacturing plant located in Bin Qasim has a production capacity of 150,000 vehicles per year. Among others, Millat Tractors, [[Daihatsu]], HinoPak Buses and Trucks manufacturing plants are also located in Karachi. The now-defunct [[Adam Motor Company]] was formerly located in the city.\n\nWork is being done to promote the development of higher value added textile products, most notably by [[Ayesha Tammy Haq]], an attorney who also has a television talk show.

At the time, and being a professor of classical dance, she became part of the play ''Ballet del Teatro Argentino''.

In 2010 for a magazine she named [[N\u00e9lida Roca]] as her biggest inspiration as a vedette while she was also making a tribute to her:\n\n<blockquote>\"I am not at the height of N\u00e9lida, but I wish to be so one day.

When Guerrero was just two years old, they separated. Her father continued his life in the north country and she, with her mother and brother Emiliano, returned to Buenos Aires.<ref>[http://www.fotolog.com.br/bellasdelplata/49920587/bellas-de-la-plata/ Bellas de La Plata]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nHer brother went to live in Mar del Plata and left her and her mother alone. After a difficult illness, Guerrero's mother died three days before Guerrero's birthday, leaving her alone in Buenos Aires.\n\nIn 2009 Guerrero's father died, which got her to see the world in a more [[spirituality|spiritual]] way.\n\nGuerrero has said that her mother taught her yoga and reading at age 13 years, and at age of 7 her mother took her to her first dance lessons because she was always playing street soccer. Guerrero studied [[psychology]] as an alternative career future, which was never finalized. She has commented that she will finish her studies when possible. She confirmed on February 15, 2014 that she was currently finishing her studies in psychology.<ref name=\"Adabel Guerrero \u00a1extravagante!\"/>\n\nHer brother Emiliando was attacking Guerrero in 2011 in the media, talking about her \"very dark\" past and saying that people didn't know the real Adabel Guerrero.

Guerrero studied [[psychology]] as an alternative career future, which was never finalized. She has commented that she will finish her studies when possible.

The judiciary consists of two systems: regular courts and administrative courts. The judiciary's two systems are headed by the [[Supreme Court of Finland|Supreme Court]] and the [[Supreme Administrative Court of Finland|Supreme Administrative Court]], respectively. Administrative courts process cases in which official decisions are contested. There is no constitutional court in [[Finland]] \u2013 the constitutionality of a law can be contested only as applied to an individual court case.\n\nThe citizens of Finland enjoy many individual and political freedoms, and [[suffrage]] is universal at age 18; Finnish women became the first in the world to have unrestricted rights both to vote and to run for public office.\n\nThe country's population is ethnically homogeneous with no sizable immigrant population. Few tensions exist between the [[Finnish language|Finnish]]-speaking majority and the [[Finland Swedish|Swedish]]-speaking minority, although in certain circles there is an unending debate about the status of the [[Finland Swedish|Swedish language]].{{Clarify|reason=What circles?|date=March 2018}}\n\nFinland's labor agreements are based on [[collective bargaining]]. Bargaining is highly centralized and often the government participates to coordinate [[fiscal policy]]. Finland has [[Collective agreement|universal validity of collective labour agreements]] and often, but not always, the trade unions, employers, and the Government reach a [[national income policy agreement]]. Significant Finnish trade unions include [[Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions|SAK]], [[Finnish Confederation of Salaried Employees|STTK]], [[Confederation of Unions for Academic Professionals in Finland|AKAVA]], and [[Confederation of Finnish Industries|EK]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.expat-finland.com/employment/unions.html|title=Finnish Trade Unions: Structure, purpose, and which one to join|last=Finland|first=Stuart Allt Web Design, Turku|website=www.expat-finland.com|access-date=2018-03-21}}</ref>\n\n{{Democracy Index rating|Finland|full democracy|2019}}\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Autonomous but under Russian rule ===\n\nA Finnish political identity and distinctively Finnish politics first developed under the Russian rule in the country from 1809 to 1917. During the era Finland had an autonomous position within the Russian Empire with its own legislative powers. However, all bills had to be signed into law by the Russian Emperor who was the Grand Duke of Finland. Also, military power was firmly in Russian hands. Previously Finland had been a part of Sweden and did not have any political institutions of its own, rather people of Finnish ethnicity participated in Swedish politics.<ref name=\"LOC\">Text from [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Template:PD-USGov PD] source: US Library of Congress: ''[https://cdn.loc.gov/master/frd/frdcstdy/fi/finlandcountryst00sols/finlandcountryst00sols.pdf A Country Study: Finland]'', Library of Congress Call Number DL1012 .A74 1990. {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Russian rule, political activism gradually grew demanding more autonomy and eventually independence for Finland. However, several generations of struggle were needed before the Finnish nationalist movement realized its objectives. One form of activism was the underscoring of Finnish language, also at the expense of the primacy of Swedish language that was still widely spoken and the official language of the country. Numerous members of the Swedish-speaking community entered the campaign, adopting Finnish as their language and exchanging their Swedish family names for Finnish ones. Finnish journals were founded, and Finnish became an official language in 1863. By the end of the century, there was a slight majority of Finnish-speaking students at the University of Helsinki, and Finnish-speakers made up sizable portions of the professions.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\n[[File:Schauman shoots Bobrikov.jpg|thumb|A culmination of the activism of the militant wing of the Fennomans was the assassination of General Governor [[Bobrikov]] by [[Eugen Schauman]].]] Finland's first political parties grew out of the language struggle. Those advocating full rights for Finnish-speakers formed the so-called [[Fennoman]] group that by the 1890s had split into the Old Finns and the Young Finns, the former mainly concerned with the language question, the latter urging the introduction of political liberalism. The Swedish-speaking community formed a short-lived Liberal Party. As the century drew to a close and the Fennoman movement had achieved its principal goals, economic issues and relations with the tsarist empire came to dominate politics.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nOver time Finland's modernizing economy encouraged the formation of social groups with specific, and sometimes opposing, interests. In addition to the Finnish movement's Old and Young Finns, other political organizations came into being. Because the existing political groups did not adequately represent labor's interests, a workers' party was formed at the end of the century. In 1903 it became the Finnish Social Democratic Party ([[Suomen Sosialidemokraattinen Puolue]] or SDP). At the same time labor was organizing itself, the farmers began a cooperative movement; in 1907 they formed the Agrarian Party ([[Maalaisliitto]]). The Swedish People's Party ([[Svenska Folkpartiet]] or SFP), also dating from this period, was formed to serve the entire Swedish-speaking population.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nThe Grand Duchy's relationship with St. Petersburg began to deteriorate in the 1890s. The nervousness of tsarist officials about Finnish loyalty in wartime prompted measures to bind Finland more closely to the empire. The campaign of \"Russification\" ended only with Finland's independence in 1917. In retrospect, the campaign can be seen as a failure, but for several decades it caused much turmoil within Finland, reaching its most extreme point with the assassination of the governor general in 1904. The first Russian revolution, that of 1905, allowed Finns to discard their antiquated Diet and to replace it with a unicameral legislature, the Eduskunta, elected through universal suffrage. Finland became the first European nation in which women had the franchise. The first national election, that of 1907, yielded Europe's largest social democratic parliamentary faction. In a single step, Finland went from being one of Europe's most politically backward countries to being one of its most advanced. Nonetheless, frequent dissolutions at the hands of the tsar permitted the Eduskunta to achieve little before independence.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\n=== Independence and the inter-war period ===\n\n[[File:Tampere_destroyed_in_Civil_War.jpg|thumb|[[Tampere]] in ruins. The Civil War brought destruction and suffering to the country.]] The second Russian revolution allowed Finland to break away from the Russian empire, and independence was declared on December 6, 1917. Within weeks, domestic political differences led to a [[Finnish Civil War]] that lasted until May 1918, when right-wing forces, with some German assistance, were able to claim victory. As a consequence, Finland began its existence as an independent state with a considerable segment of its people estranged from the holders of power, a circumstance that caused much strife in Finnish politics.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nAfter right-wing dreams of a monarchy based on the coronation of German prince as the king of Finland came crumbling down with the German defeat in the World War, a republic was formed. In mid-1919, Finns agreed on a new Constitution, one that constructed a modern parliamentary system of government from existing political institutions and traditions. The 200-seat unicameral parliament, the Eduskunta, was retained. A cabinet, the Council \nof State, was fashioned from the Senate of the tsarist period. A powerful presidency, derived, in part at least, from the office of governor general, was created and provided with a mixture of powers and duties that, in other countries, might be shared by such figures as king, president, and prime minister. Also included in the new governmental system was an independent judiciary. The powers of the three branches of government were controlled through \nan overlapping of powers, rather than a strict separation of powers.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nFinland faced numerous political and economic difficulties in the interwar years, but it surmounted them better than many other European countries. Despite the instability of many short-lived governments, the political system held together during the first decades of independence. While other countries succumbed to right-wing forces, Finland had only a brush with fascism. Communist organizations were banned, and their representatives in the Eduskunta arrested, but the SDP was able to recover from wounds sustained during the Civil War and was returned to power. In 1937 the party formed the first of the so-called Red-Earth coalitions with the Agrarian League, the most common party combination of the next fifty years, one that brought together the parties representing the two largest social groups. The language problem was largely resolved by provisions in the Constitution that protected the rights of the Swedish-speaking minority.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\n=== World War II and the Cold War period ===\n\nFinland's official foreign policy of neutrality in the interwar period could not offset the strategic importance of the country's territory to Nazi Germany and to the Soviet Union. The latter was convinced that it had a defensive \nneed to ensure that Finland would not be used as an avenue for attack on its northwestern areas, especially on Leningrad. Moreover, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union had agreed in the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] to divide the countries of Eastern Europe between themselves. Accordingly, the Soviet Union launched an attack of Finland in November 1939. A valiant Finnish defense slowed the invaders, but in March 1940 the Winter War ended when Finland agreed to cede to the Soviets about 10 percent of Finnish territory and to permit a Soviet military base on Finnish soil. In June 1941 Finland joined Germany as cobelligerent in its attack on the Soviet Union. In what Finns call the Continuation War, Finland confined its military actions to areas near its prewar borders. In the fall of 1944, Finland made a separate peace with the Soviet Union, one that was conditional on its ceding territory, granting basing rights, agreeing to onerous reparation payments, and expelling German forces from its territory. Nevertheless, Finland succeeded in being one of only two belligerents in Europe that stayed never occupied, independent and with its democracy intact throughout the war, the other being the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nBy the early 1950s, the patterns of postwar Finnish politics were established. No one group was dominant, but the Agrarian League held the presidency under [[Urho Kekkonen]] for a quarter century. Kekkonen first became president in 1956, and secured a place for the conservative Agrarian League as almost a permanent governing party until the late 1980s. In 1966 it changed its name to the Center Party ([[Keskustapuolue]] or Keskusta) in an attempt to appeal to a broader segment of the electorate, but it still was not successful in penetrating southern coastal Finland. Meanwhile, the Social Democratic Party historically the largest party, still remained strong but it was often riven by dissension. In addition, it had to share the leftist vote with the Communist Party of Finland ([[Suomen Kommunistinen Puolue]] or SKP). As a consequence, right-wing parties never had to face a united left. In the 1980s, the communists had severe problems adjusting to new social conditions, and they split into several warring groups. As a result, their movement had a marginal position in Finnish politics. The SFP, a moderate centrist party with liberal and conservative wings, had a slightly declining number of seats in the parliament [[Eduskunta]], but its position in the middle of the political spectrum often made it indispensable for coalition governments. The National Coalition Party (Kansallinen Kokoomuspuolue or Kokoomus), rigidly conservative in the interwar period, gradually became more moderate and grew stronger, surpassing the Center Party in the number of parliamentary seats in 1979. Excluded from a role in government for decades, possibly because it had been more right-wing earlier, the Kokoomus participated in the government formed after the national elections of 1987, supplying the prime minister, [[Harri Holkeri]]. The Liberal Party of the postwar period was never strong, and it had a negligible role by the 1980s and eventually was dissolved.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\n[[File:ETYK-Finland-delegation-1975.jpg|thumb|350px|right|The Finnish delegation to the [[OSCE]] included both prime minister Sorsa on the left and president Kekkonen on the right. Sorsa came from the SDP which was the largest party for most of the post-war era but through the presidency the Center Party nevertheless held a dominant role.]]\n\nA number of smaller parties, protest parties, and parties representing quite distinct groups filled out the list of about a dozen organizations that regularly vied for public office. Pensioners and activist Christians each had their own party, and environmentalists won several seats in the 1983 and the 1987 national elections \u2014 a movement which later grew to the modern Green Party during the 1990s. The most active of the protest parties was the Finnish Rural Party ([[Suomen Maaseudun Puolue]] or SMP), which managed to take votes from both the Center Party and leftist parties. It scored its first big successes in the 1970 national elections. Since then its electoral results \nhave varied considerably. By late 1980s, it seemed a spent force, but arose again as a populist right-wing party after changing its name to Perussuomalaiset or [[True Finns]].<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nAfter the 1966 national elections President Kekkonen succeeded in forming a popular front coalition government that contained communists, socialists, and members of the Center Party. Although this government lasted only two years and was succeeded for another decade by short-lived coalition and caretaker civil service governments, it was the beginning of what Finns call the politics of consensus. By the 1980s, consensus politics had become so dominant that some observers claimed that Finnish politics, long so bitter and contentious, had become the most boring in Western Europe. Although the larger parties differed on specific issues, and personal rivalries could be poisonous, there was broad agreement about domestic and foreign policy. The cabinet put in place after the 1983 elections, consisting mainly of social democrats and members of the Center Party, completed its whole term of office, the first government to do so in the postwar period. This ushered in an era of relatively long lasting governments where leadership changes took place mainly through regular elections.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nA foundation of the politics of consensus was the success of the system of broad incomes agreements that has characterized Finland's employee-employer relations in recent decades. The first of these, the [[Liinamaa Agreement]], dated from 1968. By the 1980s, the process was so regular as to seem institutionalized. With about 80 percent of the work force as members, unions negotiated incomes agreements with employers' organizations. The government often helped in the talks and subsequently proposed legislation embodying social welfare measures or financial measures that underpinned the agreements. The process was successful at increasing labor peace in a country that had been \nracked by strikes for the first decades after World War II. Although there were complaints that the agreements bypassed political channels or excluded minority opinion, the obvious prosperity they had helped bring about made the incomes policy system and the politics of consensus highly popular.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\n==Constitution==\n{{main|Constitution of Finland}}\nThe current version of the constitution of Finland was written on March 1, 2000. The first iteration of the constitution was adopted on July 17, 1919. The original comprised four constitutional laws and several amendments, which the latter replaced.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oikeusministerio.fi/material/attachments/om/toiminta/laitjalainvalmistelunkehittaminen/6HC1ymikp/Nousiainen_english.pdf |title=The Finnish System of Government: From a Mixed Constitution to Parliamentarism |last1=Nousiainen |first1=Jaakko |publisher=MInistry of Justice |access-date=3 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the constitution, the legislative powers are exercised by the Parliament, the governmental powers are exercised by the President of the Republic and the Government, and the judicial powers are exercised by government-independent courts of law.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1999/en19990731.pdf  |title=The Constitution of Finland - unofficial translation |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=1999\u20132011 |website=Finlex |publisher=The Ministry of Justice |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> The Supreme Court may request legislation that interprets or modifies existing laws.

In principle, the constitutionality of laws in Finland is verified by a simple vote by Parliament (see ''[[parliamentary sovereignty]]''). However, the Parliament's Constitutional Law Committee reviews any doubtful bills and recommends changes, if needed. In practice, the Constitutional Law Committee fulfils the duties of a constitutional court. A Finnish peculiarity is the possibility of making exceptions to the constitution in ordinary laws that are enacted in the same procedure as constitutional amendments. An example of such a law is the State of Preparedness Act, which gives the Government certain exceptional powers in cases of national emergency. As these powers, which correspond to US executive orders, affect constitutional basic rights, the law was enacted in the same manner as a constitutional amendment. However, it can be repealed in the same manner as an ordinary law. In addition to preview by the Constitutional Law Committee, all Finnish courts are obligated to give precedence to the constitution when there is an obvious conflict between the constitution and a regular law. Such a case is, however, very rare.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nSome matters are decided by the [[President of Finland]], the Head of State, in plenary meetings with the government, echoing the constitutional history of a [[privy council]]. The President is otherwise not present in the government, but decides on issues such as personal appointments and pardons on the advice of the relevant [[Political minister|minister]]. In the ministries, matters of secondary importance are decided by individual ministers, advised by the minister's [[Secretary of State#Finland|State Secretary]]. The Prime Minister and the other ministers in the government are responsible for their actions in office to the [[Parliament of Finland|Parliament]].\n\n==Executive branch==\nFinland has a [[parliamentary system]], even if the [[President of Finland]] is formally responsible for [[Foreign policy of Finland|foreign policy]]. Most executive power lies in the [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] (the [[Finnish Government]]) headed by the [[Prime Minister of Finland|prime minister]]. Responsibility for forming the cabinet out of several political parties and negotiating its platform is granted to the leader of the party gaining largest support in the elections for the parliament. This person also becomes prime minister of the cabinet. Any minister and the cabinet as a whole, however, must have continuing trust of the [[Parliament of Finland|parliament]] and may be voted out, resign or be replaced. The Government is made up of the prime minister and the ministers for the various departments of the central government as well as an ''ex officio'' member, the [[Chancellor of Justice#Finland|Chancellor of Justice]].\n\nIn the official usage, the \"cabinet\" (''valtioneuvosto'') are the ministers including the prime minister and the Chancellor of Justice, while the \"government\" (''hallitus'') is the cabinet presided by the president. In the popular usage, ''hallitus'' (with the president) may also refer to ''valtioneuvosto'' (without the president).\n\n===President===\n{{main|President of Finland}}\n\nThough Finland has a primarily parliamentary system, the President has some notable powers. The foreign policy is led by the President in co-operation with the government, and the same applies to matters concerning [[national security]]. The main executive power lies in the cabinet, which is headed by the Prime Minister. Before the 2000 constitutional rewrite, the President enjoyed more governing power.\n\nElected for a six-year term, the president:\n*Handles [[Foreign relations of Finland|Finland's foreign affairs]] in cooperation with the Cabinet, except for certain international agreements and decisions of [[peace]] or [[war]], which must be submitted to the parliament\n*Is [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the armed forces;\n*Has some decree and appointive powers\n*Approves laws, and may call extraordinary parliamentary sessions\n*Formally appoints the [[Prime Minister of Finland]] selected by the Parliament, and formally appoints the rest of the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] (Government) as proposed by the Prime Minister\n\n===Government===\n{{main|Finnish Government}}\n\nThe Government is made up of the Prime Minister and other ministers for the various ministries of the central government as well as an ''ex officio'' member, the Chancellor of Justice.

The parliament may alter the [[Constitution of Finland]], bring about the resignation of the Government, and override presidential vetoes. Its acts are not subject to judicial review. [[Legislation]] may be initiated by the Government, or one of members of Parliament, who are elected for a four-year term on the basis of proportional representation through [[open list]] multi-member districts. Persons 18 or older, except military personnel on active duty and a few high judicial officials, are eligible for election. The regular parliamentary term is four years; however, the president may dissolve the eduskunta and order new elections at the request of the prime minister and after consulting the speaker of parliament.\n\nThe parliament has, since [[equal and common suffrage]] was introduced in 1906, been dominated by [[National Coalition Party (Finland)|secular Conservatives]], [[Centre Party of Finland|the Centre Party (former Agrarian Union)]], and [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democrats]]. Nevertheless, none of these has held a single-party majority, with the notable exception of [[1916 Finnish parliamentary election|1916 elections]] where Social Democrats gained 103 of the 200 seats. After 1944, [[Communist Party of Finland|Communists]] were a factor to consider for a few decades, and the [[Finnish People's Democratic League]], formed by Communists and others to the left of Social Democrats, was the largest party after [[1958 Finnish parliamentary election|1958 elections]]. Support for Communists decreased sharply in the early 1980s, while later on the same decade environmentalists formed the [[Green League]], which is now one of the largest parties. The [[Swedish People's Party in Finland|Swedish People's Party]] represents the [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Finland-Swedes]], especially in [[language politics]]. The relative strengths of the parties vary only slightly in the elections due to the proportional election from multi-member districts, but there are some visible long-term trends.\n\nThere is no [[constitutional court]]; matters concerning constitutional rights or constitutional law are processed by the Constitutional Committee of the Parliament (''perustuslakivaliokunta''). Additionally, the Constitutional Committee has the sole power to refer a case to the [[High Court of Impeachment]] (''valtakunnanoikeus'') and to authorize police investigations for this purpose.\n\nIn addition to the parliament, the Cabinet and President may produce [[regulation]]s (''asetus'') through a [[rulemaking]] process. These give more specific instructions on how to apply statutes, which often explicitly [[Delegated legislation|delegate regulation of specific details]] to the government. Regulations must be based on an existing law, and they can clarify and specify, but not contradict the statute. Furthermore, the rights of an individual must always be based on a statute, not a regulation. Often the statute and the regulation come in similarly named pairs. For example, the law on primary education lists the subjects to the taught, and the regulation specifies the required number of teaching hours. Most of regulations are given by the Cabinet, but the President may give regulations concerning national security. Before 2000, the President had the right to enact regulations on matters not governed by parliamentary law, but this power was removed, and existing regulations were converted into regular statutes by the Parliament.\n\n==Political parties and elections==\n{{main|2018 Finnish presidential election|Finnish parliamentary election, 2019}}\n{{elect|List of political parties in Finland|Elections in Finland}}\n\nFinland's proportional representation system encourages a multitude of [[political party|political parties]] and hasnts has been short, but since about 1980 the trend has been that the same coalition rules for the whole period between elections.\n\nFinland elects on national level a [[head of state]]\u2014the [[President (government title)|president]]\u2014and a [[legislature]].

The [[Parliament of Finland|Parliament]] has 200 members, elected for a four-year term by [[proportional representation]] in multi-seat [[constituency|constituencies]]. Finland has a [[multi-party]] system, with multiple strong parties, in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and [[political parties|parties]] must work with each other to form [[coalition government]]s.\n\nIn addition to the presidential and parliamentary elections, there are [[Elections in the European Union|European Parliament elections]] every five years, and local municipal elections (held simultaneously in every [[municipalities of Finland|municipality]]) every four years.\n\n==Judiciary==\n{{main|Judicial system of Finland}}\n\nFinland has a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system, which is based on Swedish law, with the judiciary exercising limited powers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oikeus.fi/en/index/esitteet/olauspetrintuomarinohjeet.html |title= 450-year-old judicial instructions  |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= 2013 |website=oikeus.fi |publisher=Ministry of Justice |access-date=3 September 2016}}</ref> Proceedings are [[Inquisitorial system|inquisitorial]], where judges preside, conduct finding of fact, adjudication and giving of sanctions such as sentences; no juries are used.

For further detention, a court must order the imprisonment. One does not have the right for one phonecall: the police officer leading the investigation may inform relatives or similar if the investigation permits. However, a lawyer can be invited. Search warrants are not strictly needed, and are usually issued by a police officer. Wiretapping does need a court order.\n\nFinland has a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] (Roman law) system with an inquisitorial procedure.

After the [[history of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, Finland freed itself from the last restrictions imposed on it by the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris peace treaties of 1947]]. The Finnish-Soviet Agreement of Friendship, Co-operation, and Mutual Assistance (and the restrictions included therein) was annulled but Finland recognised the Russian Federation as the successor of the USSR and was quick to draft bilateral treaties of goodwill as well as reallocating Soviet debts.\n\nFinland deepened her participation in the European integration by joining the [[European Union]] with Sweden and Austria in 1995. It could be perhaps said that the country's policy of neutrality has been moderated to \"military non-alignment\" with an emphasis on maintaining a competent independent defence. [[Peacekeeping]] under the auspices of the [[United Nations]] is the only real extra-national military responsibility which Finland undertakes.\n\nFinland is highly dependent on foreign trade and actively participates in international cooperation.

During the era Finland had an autonomous position within the Russian Empire with its own legislative powers. However, all bills had to be signed into law by the Russian Emperor who was the Grand Duke of Finland. Also, military power was firmly in Russian hands. Previously Finland had been a part of Sweden and did not have any political institutions of its own, rather people of Finnish ethnicity participated in Swedish politics.<ref name=\"LOC\">Text from [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Template:PD-USGov PD] source: US Library of Congress: ''[https://cdn.loc.gov/master/frd/frdcstdy/fi/finlandcountryst00sols/finlandcountryst00sols.pdf A Country Study: Finland]'', Library of Congress Call Number DL1012 .A74 1990. {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Russian rule, political activism gradually grew demanding more autonomy and eventually independence for Finland. However, several generations of struggle were needed before the Finnish nationalist movement realized its objectives. One form of activism was the underscoring of Finnish language, also at the expense of the primacy of Swedish language that was still widely spoken and the official language of the country. Numerous members of the Swedish-speaking community entered the campaign, adopting Finnish as their language and exchanging their Swedish family names for Finnish ones. Finnish journals were founded, and Finnish became an official language in 1863. By the end of the century, there was a slight majority of Finnish-speaking students at the University of Helsinki, and Finnish-speakers made up sizable portions of the professions.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\n[[File:Schauman shoots Bobrikov.jpg|thumb|A culmination of the activism of the militant wing of the Fennomans was the assassination of General Governor [[Bobrikov]] by [[Eugen Schauman]].]] Finland's first political parties grew out of the language struggle. Those advocating full rights for Finnish-speakers formed the so-called [[Fennoman]] group that by the 1890s had split into the Old Finns and the Young Finns, the former mainly concerned with the language question, the latter urging the introduction of political liberalism. The Swedish-speaking community formed a short-lived Liberal Party. As the century drew to a close and the Fennoman movement had achieved its principal goals, economic issues and relations with the tsarist empire came to dominate politics.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nOver time Finland's modernizing economy encouraged the formation of social groups with specific, and sometimes opposing, interests. In addition to the Finnish movement's Old and Young Finns, other political organizations came into being. Because the existing political groups did not adequately represent labor's interests, a workers' party was formed at the end of the century. In 1903 it became the Finnish Social Democratic Party ([[Suomen Sosialidemokraattinen Puolue]] or SDP). At the same time labor was organizing itself, the farmers began a cooperative movement; in 1907 they formed the Agrarian Party ([[Maalaisliitto]]). The Swedish People's Party ([[Svenska Folkpartiet]] or SFP), also dating from this period, was formed to serve the entire Swedish-speaking population.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nThe Grand Duchy's relationship with St. Petersburg began to deteriorate in the 1890s. The nervousness of tsarist officials about Finnish loyalty in wartime prompted measures to bind Finland more closely to the empire. The campaign of \"Russification\" ended only with Finland's independence in 1917. In retrospect, the campaign can be seen as a failure, but for several decades it caused much turmoil within Finland, reaching its most extreme point with the assassination of the governor general in 1904. The first Russian revolution, that of 1905, allowed Finns to discard their antiquated Diet and to replace it with a unicameral legislature, the Eduskunta, elected through universal suffrage. Finland became the first European nation in which women had the franchise. The first national election, that of 1907, yielded Europe's largest social democratic parliamentary faction. In a single step, Finland went from being one of Europe's most politically backward countries to being one of its most advanced. Nonetheless, frequent dissolutions at the hands of the tsar permitted the Eduskunta to achieve little before independence.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\n=== Independence and the inter-war period ===\n\n[[File:Tampere_destroyed_in_Civil_War.jpg|thumb|[[Tampere]] in ruins. The Civil War brought destruction and suffering to the country.]] The second Russian revolution allowed Finland to break away from the Russian empire, and independence was declared on December 6, 1917. Within weeks, domestic political differences led to a [[Finnish Civil War]] that lasted until May 1918, when right-wing forces, with some German assistance, were able to claim victory. As a consequence, Finland began its existence as an independent state with a considerable segment of its people estranged from the holders of power, a circumstance that caused much strife in Finnish politics.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nAfter right-wing dreams of a monarchy based on the coronation of German prince as the king of Finland came crumbling down with the German defeat in the World War, a republic was formed. In mid-1919, Finns agreed on a new Constitution, one that constructed a modern parliamentary system of government from existing political institutions and traditions. The 200-seat unicameral parliament, the Eduskunta, was retained. A cabinet, the Council \nof State, was fashioned from the Senate of the tsarist period. A powerful presidency, derived, in part at least, from the office of governor general, was created and provided with a mixture of powers and duties that, in other countries, might be shared by such figures as king, president, and prime minister. Also included in the new governmental system was an independent judiciary. The powers of the three branches of government were controlled through \nan overlapping of powers, rather than a strict separation of powers.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nFinland faced numerous political and economic difficulties in the interwar years, but it surmounted them better than many other European countries. Despite the instability of many short-lived governments, the political system held together during the first decades of independence. While other countries succumbed to right-wing forces, Finland had only a brush with fascism. Communist organizations were banned, and their representatives in the Eduskunta arrested, but the SDP was able to recover from wounds sustained during the Civil War and was returned to power. In 1937 the party formed the first of the so-called Red-Earth coalitions with the Agrarian League, the most common party combination of the next fifty years, one that brought together the parties representing the two largest social groups. The language problem was largely resolved by provisions in the Constitution that protected the rights of the Swedish-speaking minority.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\n=== World War II and the Cold War period ===\n\nFinland's official foreign policy of neutrality in the interwar period could not offset the strategic importance of the country's territory to Nazi Germany and to the Soviet Union. The latter was convinced that it had a defensive \nneed to ensure that Finland would not be used as an avenue for attack on its northwestern areas, especially on Leningrad. Moreover, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union had agreed in the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] to divide the countries of Eastern Europe between themselves. Accordingly, the Soviet Union launched an attack of Finland in November 1939. A valiant Finnish defense slowed the invaders, but in March 1940 the Winter War ended when Finland agreed to cede to the Soviets about 10 percent of Finnish territory and to permit a Soviet military base on Finnish soil. In June 1941 Finland joined Germany as cobelligerent in its attack on the Soviet Union. In what Finns call the Continuation War, Finland confined its military actions to areas near its prewar borders. In the fall of 1944, Finland made a separate peace with the Soviet Union, one that was conditional on its ceding territory, granting basing rights, agreeing to onerous reparation payments, and expelling German forces from its territory. Nevertheless, Finland succeeded in being one of only two belligerents in Europe that stayed never occupied, independent and with its democracy intact throughout the war, the other being the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nBy the early 1950s, the patterns of postwar Finnish politics were established. No one group was dominant, but the Agrarian League held the presidency under [[Urho Kekkonen]] for a quarter century. Kekkonen first became president in 1956, and secured a place for the conservative Agrarian League as almost a permanent governing party until the late 1980s. In 1966 it changed its name to the Center Party ([[Keskustapuolue]] or Keskusta) in an attempt to appeal to a broader segment of the electorate, but it still was not successful in penetrating southern coastal Finland. Meanwhile, the Social Democratic Party historically the largest party, still remained strong but it was often riven by dissension. In addition, it had to share the leftist vote with the Communist Party of Finland ([[Suomen Kommunistinen Puolue]] or SKP). As a consequence, right-wing parties never had to face a united left. In the 1980s, the communists had severe problems adjusting to new social conditions, and they split into several warring groups. As a result, their movement had a marginal position in Finnish politics. The SFP, a moderate centrist party with liberal and conservative wings, had a slightly declining number of seats in the parliament [[Eduskunta]], but its position in the middle of the political spectrum often made it indispensable for coalition governments. The National Coalition Party (Kansallinen Kokoomuspuolue or Kokoomus), rigidly conservative in the interwar period, gradually became more moderate and grew stronger, surpassing the Center Party in the number of parliamentary seats in 1979. Excluded from a role in government for decades, possibly because it had been more right-wing earlier, the Kokoomus participated in the government formed after the national elections of 1987, supplying the prime minister, [[Harri Holkeri]]. The Liberal Party of the postwar period was never strong, and it had a negligible role by the 1980s and eventually was dissolved.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\n[[File:ETYK-Finland-delegation-1975.jpg|thumb|350px|right|The Finnish delegation to the [[OSCE]] included both prime minister Sorsa on the left and president Kekkonen on the right. Sorsa came from the SDP which was the largest party for most of the post-war era but through the presidency the Center Party nevertheless held a dominant role.]]\n\nA number of smaller parties, protest parties, and parties representing quite distinct groups filled out the list of about a dozen organizations that regularly vied for public office. Pensioners and activist Christians each had their own party, and environmentalists won several seats in the 1983 and the 1987 national elections \u2014 a movement which later grew to the modern Green Party during the 1990s. The most active of the protest parties was the Finnish Rural Party ([[Suomen Maaseudun Puolue]] or SMP), which managed to take votes from both the Center Party and leftist parties. It scored its first big successes in the 1970 national elections. Since then its electoral results \nhave varied considerably. By late 1980s, it seemed a spent force, but arose again as a populist right-wing party after changing its name to Perussuomalaiset or [[True Finns]].<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nAfter the 1966 national elections President Kekkonen succeeded in forming a popular front coalition government that contained communists, socialists, and members of the Center Party. Although this government lasted only two years and was succeeded for another decade by short-lived coalition and caretaker civil service governments, it was the beginning of what Finns call the politics of consensus. By the 1980s, consensus politics had become so dominant that some observers claimed that Finnish politics, long so bitter and contentious, had become the most boring in Western Europe. Although the larger parties differed on specific issues, and personal rivalries could be poisonous, there was broad agreement about domestic and foreign policy. The cabinet put in place after the 1983 elections, consisting mainly of social democrats and members of the Center Party, completed its whole term of office, the first government to do so in the postwar period. This ushered in an era of relatively long lasting governments where leadership changes took place mainly through regular elections.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nA foundation of the politics of consensus was the success of the system of broad incomes agreements that has characterized Finland's employee-employer relations in recent decades. The first of these, the [[Liinamaa Agreement]], dated from 1968. By the 1980s, the process was so regular as to seem institutionalized. With about 80 percent of the work force as members, unions negotiated incomes agreements with employers' organizations. The government often helped in the talks and subsequently proposed legislation embodying social welfare measures or financial measures that underpinned the agreements. The process was successful at increasing labor peace in a country that had been \nracked by strikes for the first decades after World War II. Although there were complaints that the agreements bypassed political channels or excluded minority opinion, the obvious prosperity they had helped bring about made the incomes policy system and the politics of consensus highly popular.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\n==Constitution==\n{{main|Constitution of Finland}}\nThe current version of the constitution of Finland was written on March 1, 2000. The first iteration of the constitution was adopted on July 17, 1919. The original comprised four constitutional laws and several amendments, which the latter replaced.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oikeusministerio.fi/material/attachments/om/toiminta/laitjalainvalmistelunkehittaminen/6HC1ymikp/Nousiainen_english.pdf |title=The Finnish System of Government: From a Mixed Constitution to Parliamentarism |last1=Nousiainen |first1=Jaakko |publisher=MInistry of Justice |access-date=3 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the constitution, the legislative powers are exercised by the Parliament, the governmental powers are exercised by the President of the Republic and the Government, and the judicial powers are exercised by government-independent courts of law.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1999/en19990731.pdf  |title=The Constitution of Finland - unofficial translation |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=1999\u20132011 |website=Finlex |publisher=The Ministry of Justice |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> The Supreme Court may request legislation that interprets or modifies existing laws.

In principle, the constitutionality of laws in Finland is verified by a simple vote by Parliament (see ''[[parliamentary sovereignty]]''). However, the Parliament's Constitutional Law Committee reviews any doubtful bills and recommends changes, if needed. In practice, the Constitutional Law Committee fulfils the duties of a constitutional court. A Finnish peculiarity is the possibility of making exceptions to the constitution in ordinary laws that are enacted in the same procedure as constitutional amendments. An example of such a law is the State of Preparedness Act, which gives the Government certain exceptional powers in cases of national emergency. As these powers, which correspond to US executive orders, affect constitutional basic rights, the law was enacted in the same manner as a constitutional amendment. However, it can be repealed in the same manner as an ordinary law. In addition to preview by the Constitutional Law Committee, all Finnish courts are obligated to give precedence to the constitution when there is an obvious conflict between the constitution and a regular law. Such a case is, however, very rare.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nSome matters are decided by the [[President of Finland]], the Head of State, in plenary meetings with the government, echoing the constitutional history of a [[privy council]]. The President is otherwise not present in the government, but decides on issues such as personal appointments and pardons on the advice of the relevant [[Political minister|minister]]. In the ministries, matters of secondary importance are decided by individual ministers, advised by the minister's [[Secretary of State#Finland|State Secretary]]. The Prime Minister and the other ministers in the government are responsible for their actions in office to the [[Parliament of Finland|Parliament]].\n\n==Executive branch==\nFinland has a [[parliamentary system]], even if the [[President of Finland]] is formally responsible for [[Foreign policy of Finland|foreign policy]]. Most executive power lies in the [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] (the [[Finnish Government]]) headed by the [[Prime Minister of Finland|prime minister]]. Responsibility for forming the cabinet out of several political parties and negotiating its platform is granted to the leader of the party gaining largest support in the elections for the parliament. This person also becomes prime minister of the cabinet. Any minister and the cabinet as a whole, however, must have continuing trust of the [[Parliament of Finland|parliament]] and may be voted out, resign or be replaced. The Government is made up of the prime minister and the ministers for the various departments of the central government as well as an ''ex officio'' member, the [[Chancellor of Justice#Finland|Chancellor of Justice]].\n\nIn the official usage, the \"cabinet\" (''valtioneuvosto'') are the ministers including the prime minister and the Chancellor of Justice, while the \"government\" (''hallitus'') is the cabinet presided by the president. In the popular usage, ''hallitus'' (with the president) may also refer to ''valtioneuvosto'' (without the president).\n\n===President===\n{{main|President of Finland}}\n\nThough Finland has a primarily parliamentary system, the President has some notable powers. The foreign policy is led by the President in co-operation with the government, and the same applies to matters concerning [[national security]]. The main executive power lies in the cabinet, which is headed by the Prime Minister. Before the 2000 constitutional rewrite, the President enjoyed more governing power.\n\nElected for a six-year term, the president:\n*Handles [[Foreign relations of Finland|Finland's foreign affairs]] in cooperation with the Cabinet, except for certain international agreements and decisions of [[peace]] or [[war]], which must be submitted to the parliament\n*Is [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the armed forces;\n*Has some decree and appointive powers\n*Approves laws, and may call extraordinary parliamentary sessions\n*Formally appoints the [[Prime Minister of Finland]] selected by the Parliament, and formally appoints the rest of the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] (Government) as proposed by the Prime Minister\n\n===Government===\n{{main|Finnish Government}}\n\nThe Government is made up of the Prime Minister and other ministers for the various ministries of the central government as well as an ''ex officio'' member, the Chancellor of Justice. Ministers are not obliged to be members of [[Parliament of Finland|Parliament]] and need not be formally identified with any political party.\n\nThe Government produces most of the material that the Parliament deals with, such as proposals for new laws or legislative reforms, and the annual budget.

It is the supreme legislative authority in Finland. The parliament may alter the [[Constitution of Finland]], bring about the resignation of the Government, and override presidential vetoes. Its acts are not subject to judicial review. [[Legislation]] may be initiated by the Government, or one of members of Parliament, who are elected for a four-year term on the basis of proportional representation through [[open list]] multi-member districts. Persons 18 or older, except military personnel on active duty and a few high judicial officials, are eligible for election. The regular parliamentary term is four years; however, the president may dissolve the eduskunta and order new elections at the request of the prime minister and after consulting the speaker of parliament.\n\nThe parliament has, since [[equal and common suffrage]] was introduced in 1906, been dominated by [[National Coalition Party (Finland)|secular Conservatives]], [[Centre Party of Finland|the Centre Party (former Agrarian Union)]], and [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democrats]]. Nevertheless, none of these has held a single-party majority, with the notable exception of [[1916 Finnish parliamentary election|1916 elections]] where Social Democrats gained 103 of the 200 seats. After 1944, [[Communist Party of Finland|Communists]] were a factor to consider for a few decades, and the [[Finnish People's Democratic League]], formed by Communists and others to the left of Social Democrats, was the largest party after [[1958 Finnish parliamentary election|1958 elections]]. Support for Communists decreased sharply in the early 1980s, while later on the same decade environmentalists formed the [[Green League]], which is now one of the largest parties. The [[Swedish People's Party in Finland|Swedish People's Party]] represents the [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Finland-Swedes]], especially in [[language politics]]. The relative strengths of the parties vary only slightly in the elections due to the proportional election from multi-member districts, but there are some visible long-term trends.\n\nThere is no [[constitutional court]]; matters concerning constitutional rights or constitutional law are processed by the Constitutional Committee of the Parliament (''perustuslakivaliokunta''). Additionally, the Constitutional Committee has the sole power to refer a case to the [[High Court of Impeachment]] (''valtakunnanoikeus'') and to authorize police investigations for this purpose.\n\nIn addition to the parliament, the Cabinet and President may produce [[regulation]]s (''asetus'') through a [[rulemaking]] process. These give more specific instructions on how to apply statutes, which often explicitly [[Delegated legislation|delegate regulation of specific details]] to the government. Regulations must be based on an existing law, and they can clarify and specify, but not contradict the statute. Furthermore, the rights of an individual must always be based on a statute, not a regulation. Often the statute and the regulation come in similarly named pairs. For example, the law on primary education lists the subjects to the taught, and the regulation specifies the required number of teaching hours. Most of regulations are given by the Cabinet, but the President may give regulations concerning national security. Before 2000, the President had the right to enact regulations on matters not governed by parliamentary law, but this power was removed, and existing regulations were converted into regular statutes by the Parliament.\n\n==Political parties and elections==\n{{main|2018 Finnish presidential election|Finnish parliamentary election, 2019}}\n{{elect|List of political parties in Finland|Elections in Finland}}\n\nFinland's proportional representation system encourages a multitude of [[political party|political parties]] and hasnts has been short, but since about 1980 the trend has been that the same coalition rules for the whole period between elections.\n\nFinland elects on national level a [[head of state]]\u2014the [[President (government title)|president]]\u2014and a [[legislature]]. The president is elected for a six-year term by the people. The [[Parliament of Finland|Parliament]] has 200 members, elected for a four-year term by [[proportional representation]] in multi-seat [[constituency|constituencies]]. Finland has a [[multi-party]] system, with multiple strong parties, in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and [[political parties|parties]] must work with each other to form [[coalition government]]s.\n\nIn addition to the presidential and parliamentary elections, there are [[Elections in the European Union|European Parliament elections]] every five years, and local municipal elections (held simultaneously in every [[municipalities of Finland|municipality]]) every four years.\n\n==Judiciary==\n{{main|Judicial system of Finland}}\n\nFinland has a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system, which is based on Swedish law, with the judiciary exercising limited powers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oikeus.fi/en/index/esitteet/olauspetrintuomarinohjeet.html |title= 450-year-old judicial instructions  |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= 2013 |website=oikeus.fi |publisher=Ministry of Justice |access-date=3 September 2016}}</ref> Proceedings are [[Inquisitorial system|inquisitorial]], where judges preside, conduct finding of fact, adjudication and giving of sanctions such as sentences; no juries are used.

Precedent is not binding, with the exception of Supreme Court and Supreme Administrative Court decisions.\n\nThe judicial system of Finland is divided between [[court (judicial)|courts]] with regular civil and criminal jurisdiction and [[administrative court]]s with responsibility for litigation between the individuals and the administrative organs of the state and the communities. Finnish law is codified and its court system consists of local courts, regional appellate courts, and the [[Judicial system of Finland#Supreme Court|Supreme Court]]. The administrative branch of justice consists of administrative courts and the [[Judicial system of Finland#Supreme Administrative Court|Supreme Administrative Court]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oikeus.fi/tuomioistuimet/en/index.html |title= Finnish courts  |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=oikeus.fi |publisher=Ministry of Justice |access-date=3 September 2016}}</ref>  The administrative process has more popularity as it is cheaper and has lower financial risk to the person making claims. In addition to the regular courts, there are a few special courts in certain branches of administration. There is also a [[Judicial system of Finland#High Court of Impeachment|High Court of Impeachment]] for criminal charges (for an offence in office) against the President of the Republic, the justices of the supreme courts, members of the Government, the [[Chancellor of Justice#Finland|Chancellor of Justice]] and the [[Ombudsman#Finland|Ombudsman]] of Parliament.\n\nAlthough there is no writ of [[habeas corpus]] or [[bail]], the maximum period of pre-trial detention has been reduced to four days. For further detention, a court must order the imprisonment. One does not have the right for one phonecall: the police officer leading the investigation may inform relatives or similar if the investigation permits. However, a lawyer can be invited. Search warrants are not strictly needed, and are usually issued by a police officer. Wiretapping does need a court order.\n\nFinland has a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] (Roman law) system with an inquisitorial procedure. In accordance with the [[separation of powers]], the ''trias politica'' principle, courts of law are independent of other administration. They base their decisions solely on the law in force.<ref name=\"SANDM3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.suomi.fi/suomifi/english/state_and_municipalities/index.html|title=State and municipalities|website=suomi.fi|access-date=19 January 2017}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> Criminal cases, civil cases and petitionary matters are dealt in 27 district courts, and then, if the decision is not satisfactory to the involved parties, can be applied in six Courts of Appeal.

Regional state administrative agencies have mostly law enforcement, rescue and judicial duties: police, fire and rescue, emergency readiness, basic services, environmental permits and enforcement and occupational health and safety protection. The Centres implement labor and industrial policy, provide employment and immigration services, and promote culture; maintain highways, other transport networks and infrastructure; and protect, monitor and manage the environment, land use and water resources.\n\nThe [[\u00c5land Islands]] are located near the 60th parallel between [[Sweden]] and Finland.

After the [[history of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, Finland freed itself from the last restrictions imposed on it by the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris peace treaties of 1947]]. The Finnish-Soviet Agreement of Friendship, Co-operation, and Mutual Assistance (and the restrictions included therein) was annulled but Finland recognised the Russian Federation as the successor of the USSR and was quick to draft bilateral treaties of goodwill as well as reallocating Soviet debts.\n\nFinland deepened her participation in the European integration by joining the [[European Union]] with Sweden and Austria in 1995. It could be perhaps said that the country's policy of neutrality has been moderated to \"military non-alignment\" with an emphasis on maintaining a competent independent defence. [[Peacekeeping]] under the auspices of the [[United Nations]] is the only real extra-national military responsibility which Finland undertakes.\n\nFinland is highly dependent on foreign trade and actively participates in international cooperation.
