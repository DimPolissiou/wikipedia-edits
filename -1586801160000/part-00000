The film features an [[all-star]] cast with [[Matthew Modine]], [[Eric Stoltz]], and [[Harry Connick Jr.]] (in his film debut) in leading roles. ''Memphis Belle'' is a fictionalization of the 1944 [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''[[Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress]]'' by director [[William Wyler]], about the 25th and last mission of an American [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] [[bomber]], the ''[[Memphis Belle (aircraft)|Memphis Belle]]'', based in [[England]] during [[World War II]].<ref>Orriss 1984, p. 83.</ref> The 1990 version was co-produced by David Puttnam and Wyler's daughter Catherine and dedicated to her father. The film<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parkcircus.com/film/110046-Memphis-Belle|title=Memphis Belle|website=Park Circus|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> closes with a dedication to all airmen, friend or foe, who fought in the skies above Europe during World War II.\n\n==Plot==\nIn May 1943, the crew of the ''Memphis Belle'', a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress of the [[United States Army Air Forces|US Army Air Force]], are grounded in England while their aircraft is repaired. The group is under the command of Col. Craig Harriman ([[David Strathairn]]), a no-nonsense, stoical leader who has been given the task of keeping the pressure on Adolf targets. An Army publicist, Lt. Col. Bruce Derringer ([[John Lithgow]]) is visiting the base, to interview the ''Belle'' crew in anticipation of their flying their 25th mission, a requirement to complete their tour of duty. Derringer is eager to use the crew on a war bonds tour stateside. He believes their success would help the war effort and confides to Harriman that many people back home are upset at the losses the Air Force has suffered. Some are beginning to think [[Combined Bomber Offensive|daylight bombing]] is ineffective, while Harriman openly favors it. Derringer informs him that it's his job to show this to the American public as a means of getting their support.\n\nThe officers of the squadron are informed the target for the day will be [[Bremen]], Germany. After a delay due to poor weather over the target, the ''Memphis Belle'' and her squadron are airborne. They are soon assembled in formation with bomb group and their escort of [[North American P-51 Mustang]] fighters. They face frequent harassment by defending German [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighters along the way. Eventually, the escorting fighters, low on fuel, turn away, while the bombers continue alone.\n\nBack at the base, Harriman and Derringer have harsh words after the latter starts decorating the mess hall for a celebration upon the Belle's return. Derringer accuses Harriman of being cold-hearted, concerned only with advancing his military career, and not really knowing the men under his command. In response, Harriman brings Derringer into his office and angrily dumps a pile of letters on his desk, then forces Derringer to read one of them. They are replies Harriman received from the grieving families of lost airmen to the condolence letters which he had sent, and partway through the first, Derringer is struck by the realization that the colonel had in fact known even the enlisted men who had been killed. The words of other letters are voiced by those who had written them, over film footage of actual Luftwaffe attacks on B-17s. \n\nMeanwhile, the bombers have suffered significant losses. The German interceptors focus their attacks on the leading aircraft in the formation. The first lead bomber, ''Windy City'', loses its engines and explodes in front of the ''Belle'', piloted by Captain Dennis Dearborn ([[Matthew Modine]]) and co-pilot 1st Lt. Luke Sinclair ([[Tate Donovan]]). More attacks ensue, and the replacement lead bomber, ''C Cup'', is forced to break formation when its nose is damaged by gunfire from an attacking Bf 109. The crew of the ''Belle'' watch in horror when they see an airman fall out of the stricken aircraft without a parachute. The ''Belle'' is then given the task of leading the formation to the target.\n\nFinding the target \u2013 an aircraft assembly plant \u2013 becomes difficult as bombardier 1st Lt. Val Kozlowski ([[Billy Zane]]) can't see the target because of a smokescreen the Germans have created. Dearborn aborts the initial bomb run and orders the formation to circle around for a second attempt, which frustrates the Belle crew who have had to endure the ongoing attacks from the Germans. On the second run, Kozlowski spots the assembly plant through a gap in the smokescreen and the bombers successfully hit their target. Once clear of the anti-aircraft fire, they are again attacked by fighters. Staff Sgt. Richard \"Rascal\" Moore's ([[Sean Astin]]) ball turret is destroyed, but he is saved by the safety strap. The attacks continue, blasting a hole in the fuselage, tearing off a large chunk of the tail, and setting the number four engine on fire. Radio operator Staff Sgt. (T/3) Danny \"Danny Boy\" Daly ([[Eric Stoltz]]), is wounded in the attacks, which puts Kozlowski in a difficult position when the crew enlists his self-exaggerated medical \"expertise\" to save the injured radioman. Meanwhile, Dearborn and Sinclair skillfully drop the aircraft into a steep dive and put the fire out, despite great risk of losing the aircraft.\n\nAs the B-17 limps closer to base, the crew find that the wheels cannot be lowered due to electrical failure caused by battle damage, but they are able to manually crank their [[landing gear]] down just before landing. The ground crew and a humbled Lt. Colonel Derringer race to greet them with jubilant cheers. The crew exits the battered bomber and celebrate their victory with Daly on an ambulance.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Matthew Modine]] as Captain Dennis Dearborn, pilot: A humourless and socially inept perfectionist.\n* [[Tate Donovan]] as 1st Lt. Luke Sinclair, co-pilot: The carefree former lifeguard believes himself to be undervalued by Dearborn.\n* [[D.B. Sweeney]] as 1st Lt. Phil Lowenthal, navigator: Lowenthal is nervous before their final mission and convinced that he is doomed to die.\n* [[Billy Zane]] as 1st Lt. Val Kozlowski, bombardier: While everyone believes the confident, self-assured Kozlowski to be a doctor, it is later revealed he attended only two weeks of medical school before enlisting.\n* [[Eric Stoltz]] as Staff Sgt. (T/3) Danny \"Danny Boy\" Daly, radio operator: An earnest [[Irish Americans|Irish-American]], Daly was editor of the school paper, a valedictorian, and joined up right after graduating college.\n* [[Reed Diamond]] as Staff Sgt. (T/3) Virgil \"Virge\" or \"Virgin\" Hoogesteger, top turret gunner and flight engineer: Hoogesteger worked for his family's restaurant and plans to open a chain of identical restaurants after the war despite his crew-mate's warnings that such an unheard of enterprise could never succeed.\n* [[Sean Astin]] as Staff Sgt. Richard \"Rascal\" Moore, [[ball turret]] gunner: The diminutive, often crude gunner considers himself a ladies' man and delights in teasing his crewmates.\n* [[Courtney Gains]] as Staff Sgt. Eugene \"Genie\" McVey, right waist gunner. A religious and superstitious Irish-American.\n* [[Neil Giuntoli]] as Sgt. Jack Bocci, left waist gunner: A hot-tempered [[Chicago]] hoodlum, Bocci appears to look out only for himself but proves surprisingly kind to his fellow waist gunner McVey. \n* [[Harry Connick, Jr.]] as Staff Sgt.

Two were located in America (N3703G and N17W), two were in France (F-BEEA, which was destroyed in a takeoff accident<ref name=\"AAIB 11/89\">[http://www.aaib.gov.uk/cms_resources/Boeing%20B17G%20Flying%20Fortress,%20F-BEEA%2011-89.pdf \"Boeing B17G Flying Fortress, F-BEEA 11-89 .\"] ''[[Air Accident Investigation Branch]]''. Retrieved: 27 October 2014.)</ref> and F-AZDX [[The Pink Lady (aircraft)|''The Pink Lady'']]), and one was in England (G-BEDF ''[[Sally B]]''). The original Memphis Belle was a B-17F model, so any B-17Gs used in the film were heavily modified to look like an earlier F model, having chin turrets removed, tail gun positions retrofitted with older designs and being painted olive drab green. During filming, two B-17s portrayed the Belle (one was the movie version of the ''Memphis Belle'' (N3703G) and the other was ''Sally B'' for scenes requiring pyrotechnics such as smoke and sparks indicating machine gun \"hits\" while the rest had nose art and squadron markings changed numerous times to make it appear there were more aircraft.<ref>Farmer 1990. p. 31.</ref>\n\nGround sequences for the movie (including takeoff and landing scenes) were filmed at the non-operational [[RAF Binbrook]] in [[Lincolnshire]], England with a period control tower and vehicles being placed on site. Flying sequences were flown from the airfield site of the [[Imperial War Museum Duxford]]. All the [[Extra (actor)|extras]] for the film were obtained from auditions held in the area and included current and former members of the [[Royal Air Force]]. The filmmakers also used [[Pinewood Studios]] to shoot interior scenes and to shoot various models of B-17s.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/83270/Memphis-Belle/original-print-info.html \"Original print information: Memphis Belle (1990).\"] ''Turner Classic Movies''. Retrieved: 27 October 2014.</ref>\n\nA [[North American B-25 Mitchell]] was used to film the majority of the aerial scenes with several fixed and trainable cameras also mounted on the available B-17s and fighter aircraft for action shots. A [[Grumman TBM Avenger]] (with its tail section painted the same olive drab tones used on the B-17s) was used as back-up for a short time when the B-25 became unserviceable during filming.<ref>Carlson 2012 p. 120.</ref>\n\nThe film pilots were warbird display pilots coming from the UK, USA, France, Germany, New Zealand and Norway, the roster changing several times as pilots had to return to their full-time jobs during filming. The flying sequences were devised and planned under the coordination of Old Flying Machine Company (OFMC) pilots [[Ray Hanna]] and his son Mark, who also acted as chief pilots for the fighter aircraft used and flew the camera-equipped fighter and TBM Avenger aircraft during filming.<ref>Farmer 1990. p. 37.</ref>\n\nDue to a shortage of actual B-17 airframes, wooden [[silhouette]] mock-ups were made and placed at distant parts of the airfield.\n\n===Filming accident===\nA French B-17G (F-BEEA), used as a filming platform, hit a tree and a pile of gravel after losing engine power and swinging during takeoff from Binbrook and was destroyed by the subsequent fire. All 10 of the crew escaped with only minor injuries, the most serious of which being a broken leg. While lined up on runway 21 awaiting takeoff, a puff of smoke was observed by a ground engineer from the vicinity of engine three which he conjectured could have been due to an over-boost. The aircraft commenced its ground roll and after about 100 yards swung slightly to the left, which the commander (the handling pilot) corrected with the rudder and by reducing power to number 3 and 4 engines. Once corrected full power on all engines was resumed but the aircraft swung right. The commander applied corrective rudder and reduced power to number 1 and 2 engines, but this was not immediately effective and the aircraft left the runway before straightening, parallel to the runway. Knowing that the aircraft was capable of being operated from grass landing strips, the pilot opted to continue the takeoff; however, after 400\u2013500 yards and at an airspeed of 90-95&nbsp;mph the aircraft swung right and its course was obstructed by a tree which was hit by the left wing and a pile of gravel which was hit by the number 4 propeller. The aircraft yawed to the right and came to rest in a cornfield; the fuselage broke into two sections aft of the bomb bay and caught fire.<ref name=\"AAIB 11/89\" />\n\n==Historical accuracy==\nWith the exception of the aircraft names, this film is fiction based only very loosely on fact. The characters are composites, the names are not those of the real crew of the ''Memphis Belle'' and the incidents shown are supposed to be representative of B-17 missions in general. Indeed, the characters and situations of the film bear little resemblance to the crew of the actual ''Memphis Belle,'' the nature of her final mission, the accuracy of strategic bombing, or Allied policy on the bombing of civilians. No optimistic official celebration on the evening before the ''Belle's'' 25th mission occurred, and there was no special welcome for the crew when the mission was over. The aircraft's participation in the [[Bombing of Bremen in World War II|Bremen campaign]] occurred in April 1943; the final, 25th mission of the ''Belle'' was a month later to Lorient, France before being flown back to the United States.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nFor the fighters, seven P-51 Mustangs were used, five of the P-51s were painted in the markings of the first USAAF Merlin-engined Mustang squadron to operate in Britain (a few months later in 1943 than the actual mission).{{#tag:ref|[[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47 Thunderbolts]] were the escort at the time in 1943.<ref>Farmer 1990. p. 32.</ref>|group=N}} As there were no surviving flyable Messerschmitt Bf 109s, Luftwaffe fighter aircraft were represented by [[Hispano Aviaci\u00f3n HA-1112|Ha-1112]]s, a Spanish version of the Bf 109 (which were also used to represent Bf 109s in the 1969 film [[Battle of Britain (film)|''Battle of Britain'']]) in mid-war generic paint schemes.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Memphis Belle (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| type       = [[soundtrack]]\n| artist     = [[George Fenton]]\n| cover      =\n| caption    = {{deletable image-caption|Friday, 12 April 2019|PROD}}\n| alt        =\n| released   = 1 October 1990\n| recorded   = [[Abbey Road Studios]],<br />CTS Studios, and<br />[[Angel Recording Studios]],<br />[[London, England]]\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Soundtrack]]\n| length     = 42:47\n| label      = [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]]\n| producer   = {{plainlist|\n* [[George Fenton]]\n* [[Eliza Thompson]]\n}}\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\n\"The Chestnut Tree\", performed by [[Glenn Miller Orchestra|Glenn Miller And His Orchestra]] and written by [[Tommie Connor]], [[Jimmy Kennedy]] and Hamilton Kennedy is featured in the film playing over the Memphis Belle's radio, but isn't on the soundtrack album.

''Roger Ebert.com'', 12 October 1990.</ref> UK film reviewer Andy Webb had similar reservations. \"Despite its good intentions to highlight the risks and heroics of the brave men who flew dangerous bombing missions deep into enemy soil during World War II, the one thing which you can't miss about ''Memphis Belle'' is that it is a cliche commercial production.\"<ref>Webb, Andy. \"[http://www.themoviescene.co.uk/reviews/memphis-belle/memphis-belle.html Memphis Belle (1990)]\".

The ''Belle'' is then given the task of leading the formation to the target.\n\nFinding the target \u2013 an aircraft assembly plant \u2013 becomes difficult as bombardier 1st Lt. Val Kozlowski ([[Billy Zane]]) can't see the target because of a smokescreen the Germans have created. Dearborn aborts the initial bomb run and orders the formation to circle around for a second attempt, which frustrates the Belle crew who have had to endure the ongoing attacks from the Germans. On the second run, Kozlowski spots the assembly plant through a gap in the smokescreen and the bombers successfully hit their target. Once clear of the anti-aircraft fire, they are again attacked by fighters. Staff Sgt. Richard \"Rascal\" Moore's ([[Sean Astin]]) ball turret is destroyed, but he is saved by the safety strap. The attacks continue, blasting a hole in the fuselage, tearing off a large chunk of the tail, and setting the number four engine on fire. Radio operator Staff Sgt. (T/3) Danny \"Danny Boy\" Daly ([[Eric Stoltz]]), is wounded in the attacks, which puts Kozlowski in a difficult position when the crew enlists his self-exaggerated medical \"expertise\" to save the injured radioman. Meanwhile, Dearborn and Sinclair skillfully drop the aircraft into a steep dive and put the fire out, despite great risk of losing the aircraft.\n\nAs the B-17 limps closer to base, the crew find that the wheels cannot be lowered due to electrical failure caused by battle damage, but they are able to manually crank their [[landing gear]] down just before landing. The ground crew and a humbled Lt. Colonel Derringer race to greet them with jubilant cheers. The crew exits the battered bomber and celebrate their victory with Daly on an ambulance.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Matthew Modine]] as Captain Dennis Dearborn, pilot: A humourless and socially inept perfectionist.\n* [[Tate Donovan]] as 1st Lt.

Two were located in America (N3703G and N17W), two were in France (F-BEEA, which was destroyed in a takeoff accident<ref name=\"AAIB 11/89\">[http://www.aaib.gov.uk/cms_resources/Boeing%20B17G%20Flying%20Fortress,%20F-BEEA%2011-89.pdf \"Boeing B17G Flying Fortress, F-BEEA 11-89 .\"] ''[[Air Accident Investigation Branch]]''. Retrieved: 27 October 2014.)</ref> and F-AZDX [[The Pink Lady (aircraft)|''The Pink Lady'']]), and one was in England (G-BEDF ''[[Sally B]]''). The original Memphis Belle was a B-17F model, so any B-17Gs used in the film were heavily modified to look like an earlier F model, having chin turrets removed, tail gun positions retrofitted with older designs and being painted olive drab green. During filming, two B-17s portrayed the Belle (one was the movie version of the ''Memphis Belle'' (N3703G) and the other was ''Sally B'' for scenes requiring pyrotechnics such as smoke and sparks indicating machine gun \"hits\" while the rest had nose art and squadron markings changed numerous times to make it appear there were more aircraft.<ref>Farmer 1990. p. 31.</ref>\n\nGround sequences for the movie (including takeoff and landing scenes) were filmed at the non-operational [[RAF Binbrook]] in [[Lincolnshire]], England with a period control tower and vehicles being placed on site. Flying sequences were flown from the airfield site of the [[Imperial War Museum Duxford]]. All the [[Extra (actor)|extras]] for the film were obtained from auditions held in the area and included current and former members of the [[Royal Air Force]]. The filmmakers also used [[Pinewood Studios]] to shoot interior scenes and to shoot various models of B-17s.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/83270/Memphis-Belle/original-print-info.html \"Original print information: Memphis Belle (1990).\"] ''Turner Classic Movies''. Retrieved: 27 October 2014.</ref>\n\nA [[North American B-25 Mitchell]] was used to film the majority of the aerial scenes with several fixed and trainable cameras also mounted on the available B-17s and fighter aircraft for action shots. A [[Grumman TBM Avenger]] (with its tail section painted the same olive drab tones used on the B-17s) was used as back-up for a short time when the B-25 became unserviceable during filming.<ref>Carlson 2012 p. 120.</ref>\n\nThe film pilots were warbird display pilots coming from the UK, USA, France, Germany, New Zealand and Norway, the roster changing several times as pilots had to return to their full-time jobs during filming. The flying sequences were devised and planned under the coordination of Old Flying Machine Company (OFMC) pilots [[Ray Hanna]] and his son Mark, who also acted as chief pilots for the fighter aircraft used and flew the camera-equipped fighter and TBM Avenger aircraft during filming.<ref>Farmer 1990. p. 37.</ref>\n\nDue to a shortage of actual B-17 airframes, wooden [[silhouette]] mock-ups were made and placed at distant parts of the airfield.\n\n===Filming accident===\nA French B-17G (F-BEEA), used as a filming platform, hit a tree and a pile of gravel after losing engine power and swinging during takeoff from Binbrook and was destroyed by the subsequent fire. All 10 of the crew escaped with only minor injuries, the most serious of which being a broken leg. While lined up on runway 21 awaiting takeoff, a puff of smoke was observed by a ground engineer from the vicinity of engine three which he conjectured could have been due to an over-boost. The aircraft commenced its ground roll and after about 100 yards swung slightly to the left, which the commander (the handling pilot) corrected with the rudder and by reducing power to number 3 and 4 engines. Once corrected full power on all engines was resumed but the aircraft swung right. The commander applied corrective rudder and reduced power to number 1 and 2 engines, but this was not immediately effective and the aircraft left the runway before straightening, parallel to the runway. Knowing that the aircraft was capable of being operated from grass landing strips, the pilot opted to continue the takeoff; however, after 400\u2013500 yards and at an airspeed of 90-95&nbsp;mph the aircraft swung right and its course was obstructed by a tree which was hit by the left wing and a pile of gravel which was hit by the number 4 propeller. The aircraft yawed to the right and came to rest in a cornfield; the fuselage broke into two sections aft of the bomb bay and caught fire.<ref name=\"AAIB 11/89\" />\n\n==Historical accuracy==\nWith the exception of the aircraft names, this film is fiction based only very loosely on fact. The characters are composites, the names are not those of the real crew of the ''Memphis Belle'' and the incidents shown are supposed to be representative of B-17 missions in general. Indeed, the characters and situations of the film bear little resemblance to the crew of the actual ''Memphis Belle,'' the nature of her final mission, the accuracy of strategic bombing, or Allied policy on the bombing of civilians. No optimistic official celebration on the evening before the ''Belle's'' 25th mission occurred, and there was no special welcome for the crew when the mission was over. The aircraft's participation in the [[Bombing of Bremen in World War II|Bremen campaign]] occurred in April 1943; the final, 25th mission of the ''Belle'' was a month later to Lorient, France before being flown back to the United States.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nFor the fighters, seven P-51 Mustangs were used, five of the P-51s were painted in the markings of the first USAAF Merlin-engined Mustang squadron to operate in Britain (a few months later in 1943 than the actual mission).{{#tag:ref|[[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47 Thunderbolts]] were the escort at the time in 1943.<ref>Farmer 1990. p. 32.</ref>|group=N}} As there were no surviving flyable Messerschmitt Bf 109s, Luftwaffe fighter aircraft were represented by [[Hispano Aviaci\u00f3n HA-1112|Ha-1112]]s, a Spanish version of the Bf 109 (which were also used to represent Bf 109s in the 1969 film [[Battle of Britain (film)|''Battle of Britain'']]) in mid-war generic paint schemes.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Memphis Belle (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| type       = [[soundtrack]]\n| artist     = [[George Fenton]]\n| cover      =\n| caption    = {{deletable image-caption|Friday, 12 April 2019|PROD}}\n| alt        =\n| released   = 1 October 1990\n| recorded   = [[Abbey Road Studios]],<br />CTS Studios, and<br />[[Angel Recording Studios]],<br />[[London, England]]\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Soundtrack]]\n| length     = 42:47\n| label      = [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]]\n| producer   = {{plainlist|\n* [[George Fenton]]\n* [[Eliza Thompson]]\n}}\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\n\"The Chestnut Tree\", performed by [[Glenn Miller Orchestra|Glenn Miller And His Orchestra]] and written by [[Tommie Connor]], [[Jimmy Kennedy]] and Hamilton Kennedy is featured in the film playing over the Memphis Belle's radio, but isn't on the soundtrack album.

''Roger Ebert.com'', 12 October 1990.</ref> UK film reviewer Andy Webb had similar reservations. \"Despite its good intentions to highlight the risks and heroics of the brave men who flew dangerous bombing missions deep into enemy soil during World War II, the one thing which you can't miss about ''Memphis Belle'' is that it is a cliche commercial production.\"<ref>Webb, Andy. \"[http://www.themoviescene.co.uk/reviews/memphis-belle/memphis-belle.html Memphis Belle (1990)]\".

Indeed, indigenous peoples were often recognized as sovereign peoples by states, as witnessed by the hundreds of treaties concluded between indigenous peoples and the governments of the United States, Canada, New Zealand and others.<ref name=\":0\">[https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/SOWIP_web.pdf State of the World's Indigenous Peoples, Secretariat of Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, UN, 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215113446/http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/SOWIP_web.pdf |date=15 February 2010 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn May 2016, the Fifteenth Session of the [[United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues]] (UNPFII) affirmed that indigenous people (also termed aboriginal people, native people, or autochthonous people) are distinctive groups protected in international or national legislation as having a set of specific rights based on their linguistic and historical ties to a particular territory, prior to later settlement, development, and or occupation of a region.<ref name=\"Coates\">Coates 2004:12</ref> The session affirms that, since indigenous peoples are vulnerable to exploitation, [[Social exclusion|marginalization]], oppression, forced [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], and [[genocide]] by nation states formed from colonizing populations or by different, politically dominant ethnic groups, individuals and communities maintaining ways of life indigenous to their regions are entitled to special protection.\n\n==History==\n\n===Classical antiquity===\nGreek sources of the [[Classical Greece|Classical]] period acknowledge the prior existence of indigenous people(s), whom they referred to as \"[[Pelasgian]]s\". These peoples inhabited lands surrounding the [[Aegean Sea]] before the subsequent migrations of the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] ancestors claimed by these authors. The disposition and precise identity of this former group is elusive, and sources such as [[Homer]], [[Hesiod]] and [[Herodotus]] give varying, partially mythological accounts. However, it is clear that cultures existed whose indigenous characteristics were distinguished by the subsequent Hellenic cultures (and distinct from non-Greek speaking \"foreigners\", termed \"[[barbarian]]s\" by the historical Greeks).\n\n[[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] society flourished between 250&nbsp;BCE and 480&nbsp;CE and commanded successive waves of conquests that gripped more than half of the globe. But because already existent populations within other parts of Europe at the time of [[classical antiquity]] had more in common culturally speaking with the Greco-Roman world, the intricacies involved in expansion across the European frontier were not so contentious relative to indigenous issues.<ref>Hall, Gillette, and Harry Anthony Patrinos. Indigenous Peoples, Poverty and Human Development in Latin America. New York: Palgrave MacMillan, n.d. Google Scholar. Web. 11 Mar. 2013</ref>\n\nHowever, when it came to expansion in other parts of the world, namely Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, then totally new cultural dynamics had entered into the equation, and this expansion became a forerunner of what was to take the Americas, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific by storm in more recent times. Thus, the idea that expansionist societies may encounter peoples who possess cultural customs and racial appearances strikingly different from those of the colonizing power was not new to the [[Renaissance]] or the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].\n\n[[File:AlonsoFernandezdeLugo2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Lugo]] presenting the captured [[Guanches|Guanche]] kings of [[Tenerife]] to [[Ferdinand and Isabella]].]]\n\n===European expansion and colonialism===\n{{See also|Columbian exchange}}\nThe rapid and extensive spread of the various European powers from the early 15th century onward had a profound impact upon many of the indigenous cultures with whom they came into contact. The [[Age of Discovery|exploratory]] and colonial ventures in the Americas, Africa, Asia and the Pacific often resulted in territorial and cultural conflict, and the intentional or unintentional displacement and devastation of the indigenous populations.\n\nEncounters between explorers and indigenous populations in the rest of the world often introduced new [[Infection|infectious diseases]], which sometimes caused local epidemics of extraordinary virulence. For example, [[smallpox]], [[measles]], malaria, yellow fever, and others were unknown in pre-Columbian America and Australia.\n\nThe [[Canary Islands]] had an indigenous population called the [[Guanches]] whose origin is still the subject of discussion among historians and linguists.<ref>[https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/oldwrld/colonists/canary.html Old World Contacts/Colonists/Canary Islands] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013124301/http://ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/oldwrld/colonists/canary.html |date=13 October 2007 }}.

The United Nations estimates that there are over 370 million indigenous people living in over 70 countries worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/5session_factsheet1.pdf|title=Who are indigenous peoples?|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref> This would equate to just fewer than 6% of the total [[world population]].

Many indigenous populations have undergone a dramatic decline and even extinction, and remain threatened in many parts of the world. Some have also been assimilated by other populations or have undergone many other changes. In other cases, indigenous populations are undergoing a recovery or expansion in numbers.\n\nCertain indigenous societies survive even though they may no longer inhabit their \"traditional\" lands, owing to migration, relocation, forced resettlement or having been supplanted by other cultural groups.  In many other respects, the [[transformation of culture]] of indigenous groups is ongoing, and includes permanent loss of language, loss of lands, encroachment on traditional territories, and disruption in traditional ways of life due to contamination and pollution of waters and lands.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Environmental and economic benefits of having indigenous peoples tend land===\n{{See also|Climate change and indigenous peoples}}\nA WRI report mentions that \u201ctenure-secure\u201d indigenous lands generates billions and sometimes trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of benefits in the form of carbon sequestration, reduced pollution, clean water and more.

The numbers, condition and experience of indigenous groups may vary widely within a given region. A comprehensive survey is further complicated by sometimes contentious membership and identification.\n\n===Africa===\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples of Africa}}\n{{See also|:Category:Indigenous peoples of Africa}}[[File:BushmenSan.jpg|thumb|Starting fire by hand, [[San people]] in Botswana.]]\nIn the post-colonial period, the concept of specific indigenous peoples within the African continent has gained wider acceptance, although not without controversy. The highly diverse and numerous ethnic groups that comprise most modern, independent African states contain within them various peoples whose situation, cultures and [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] or [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyles are generally marginalized and set apart from the dominant political and economic structures of the nation. Since the late 20th century these peoples have increasingly sought recognition of their rights as distinct indigenous peoples, in both national and international contexts.\n\nThough the vast majority of African peoples are indigenous in the sense that they originate from that continent, in practice, identity as an ''indigenous people'' per the modern definition is more restrictive, and certainly not every African ethnic group claims identification under these terms. Groups and communities who do claim this recognition are those who, by a variety of historical and environmental circumstances, have been placed outside of the dominant state systems, and whose traditional practices and land claims often come into conflict with the objectives and policies implemented by governments, companies and surrounding dominant societies.\n\n===Americas===\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\n{{See also|:Category:Indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\n[[File:Quechuawomanandchild.jpg|thumb|left|[[Quechuas|Quechua]] woman and child in the [[Sacred Valley]], Andes, Peru.]]\nIndigenous peoples of the American continent are broadly recognized as being those groups and their descendants who inhabited the region before the arrival of European colonizers and settlers (i.e., [[Pre-Columbian]]). Indigenous peoples who maintain, or seek to maintain, traditional ways of life are found from the high Arctic north to the southern extremities of [[Tierra del Fuego]].\n\nThe impact of [[European colonization of the Americas]] on the indigenous communities has been in general quite severe, with many authorities estimating ranges of significant [[Population history of American indigenous peoples|population decline]] primarily due to disease but also violence. The extent of this impact is the subject of much continuing debate. Several peoples shortly thereafter became extinct, or very nearly so.\n\nAll nations in North and South America have populations of indigenous peoples within their borders. In some countries (particularly in Latin American), indigenous peoples form a sizable component of the overall national population \u2014 in Bolivia they account for an estimated 56\u201370% of the total nation, and at least half of the population in Guatemala and the Andean and Amazonian nations of Peru. In English, indigenous peoples are collectively referred to by different names that vary by region and include such ethnonyms as [[Native Americans (Americas)|Native Americans]], [[Amerindians]], and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]]. In Spanish or Portuguese speaking countries one finds the use of terms such as ''pueblos [[wikt:ind\u00edgena|ind\u00edgenas]]'', ''amerindios'', ''povos nativos'', ''povos ind\u00edgenas'', and, in Peru, ''Comunidades Nativas'' (Native Communities), particularly among Amazonian societies like the [[Urarina]]<ref>Dean, Bartholomew 2009 ''Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia'', Gainesville: University Press of Florida {{ISBN|978-0-8130-3378-5}} [http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07]</ref> and [[Mats\u00e9s]]. In Chile there are indigenous peoples like the [[Mapuches]] in the Center-South and the [[Aymaras]] in the North; also the [[Rapa Nui people|Rapa Nui]] indigenous to [[Easter Island]] are a [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] people.\n\nIn Brazil, the Portuguese term ''\u00edndio'' is used by most of the population, the media, the indigenous peoples themselves and even the government ([[FUNAI]] is an acronym for the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional do '''\u00cdndio'''), although its Hispanic equivalent ''indio'' is widely considered not politically correct and is falling into disuse.\n\n[[Indigenous peoples in Canada]] comprise the [[First Nations]],<ref name=\"First Nations Culture Areas Index\">{{cite web\n| title = Civilization.ca \u2013 Gateway to Aboriginal Heritage\u2013Culture\n| work = Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation\n| publisher = Government of Canada\n| date = 12 May 2006\n| url = http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/exhibitions/tresors/ethno/etb0170e.shtml\n| accessdate =18 September 2009 }}</ref> [[Inuit]]<ref name=\"ICCcharter\">{{cite web\n |title=Inuit Circumpolar Council (Canada) \u2013 ICC Charter\n |work=Inuit Circumpolar Council > ICC Charter and By-laws > ICC Charter\n |year=2007\n |url=http://inuitcircumpolar.com/index.php?auto_slide=&ID=374&Lang=En&Parent_ID=&current_slide_num=\n |accessdate=18 September 2009\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305060320/http://inuitcircumpolar.com/index.php?auto_slide=&ID=374&Lang=En&Parent_ID=&current_slide_num=\n |archivedate=5 March 2010\n |df=dmy-all\n}}\n</ref> and [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]].<ref>{{cite web\n |title=In the Kawaskimhon Aboriginal Moot Court Factum of the Federal Crown Canada\n |work=Faculty of Law\n |publisher=[[University of Manitoba]]\n |year=2007\n |url=http://www.umanitoba.ca/law/newsite/kawaskimhon_factums/FINALWrittenSubmissionsofFederalCrown_windsor.pdf\n |page=2\n |accessdate=18 September 2009\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326043230/http://www.umanitoba.ca/law/newsite/kawaskimhon_factums/FINALWrittenSubmissionsofFederalCrown_windsor.pdf\n |archivedate=26 March 2009\n |df=dmy-all\n}}\n</ref> The descriptors \"Indian\"  and \"[[Eskimo]]\" have fallen into disuse in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|title=Words First An Evolving Terminology Relating to Aboriginal Peoples in Canada |url=http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/pr/pub/wf/trmrslt_e.asp?term=12 |archive-url=http://webarchive.bac-lac.gc.ca:8080/wayback/20071114225541/http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/pr/pub/wf/trmrslt_e.asp?term=12 |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 November 2007 |publisher=Communications Branch of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada |year=2004 |accessdate=26 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=Indian>{{cite web|title=Terminology of First Nations, Native, Aboriginal and M\u00e9tis |url=http://www.aidp.bc.ca/terminology_of_native_aboriginal_metis.pdf |publisher=Aboriginal Infant Development Programs of BC |year=2009 |accessdate=26 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714021655/http://www.aidp.bc.ca/terminology_of_native_aboriginal_metis.pdf |archivedate=14 July 2010 }}</ref> According to the 2016 Census, there are around 1\u2009670\u2009000 Aboriginal people.<ref>Statistics Canada, ''[https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/index.cfm?Lang=E Canada]'' (table), ''Census Profile'', 2016 Census of Population, Catalogue \u2116 98-316-X2016001 (Ottawa: 2017\u201111\u201129);

These groups are often together spoken of as [[Indigenous Australians]].\n\nMany of the present-day Pacific Island nations in the Oceania region were originally populated by [[Polynesia]]n, [[Melanesia]]n and [[Micronesia]]n peoples over the course of thousands of years. European colonial expansion in the Pacific brought many of these under non-indigenous administration. During the 20th century several of these former colonies gained independence and nation-states were formed under local control. However, various peoples have put forward claims for indigenous recognition where their islands are still under external administration; examples include the [[Chamorros]] of [[Guam]] and the [[Northern Marianas]], and the [[Marshallese people|Marshallese]] of the [[Marshall Islands]].\n\nThe remains of at least 25 miniature humans, who lived between 1,000 and 3,000 years ago, were recently found on the islands of [[Palau]] in Micronesia.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/mar/12/fossils Pygmy human remains found on rock islands], Science | The Guardian</ref>\n\nIn most parts of Oceania, indigenous peoples outnumber the descendants of colonists. Exceptions include Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii. According to the 2013 census, New Zealand [[M\u0101ori people|Maori]] make up 14.9% of the population of New Zealand, with less than half (46.5%) of all Maori residents identifying solely as Maori. The Maori are indigenous to Polynesia and settled New Zealand relatively recently, the migrations were thought to have occurred in the 13th century CE. In New Zealand pre-contact Maori peoples were not a single people, thus the more recent grouping into tribal (iwi) arrangements has become a more formal arrangement in more recent times. Many Maori national leaders signed a treaty with the British, the [[Treaty of Waitangi]], which formed the modern geo-political entity that is New Zealand.\n\nA majority of the [[Papua New Guinea]] (PNG) population is indigenous, with more than 700 different nationalities recognized out of a total population of 8 million.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-15436981|title=Papua New Guinea country profile|date=2018|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en-GB}}</ref> The country's Constitution and key statutes identify traditional or custom-based practices and land tenure, and explicitly set out to promote the viability of these traditional societies within the modern state.

Some challenges are specific to particular groups; however, other challenges are commonly experienced.<ref>Bartholomew Dean and Jerome Levi (eds.) ''At the Risk of Being Heard: Indigenous Rights, Identity and Postcolonial States'' University of Michigan Press (2003)[https://web.archive.org/web/20060821225323/http://www.press.umich.edu/titleDetailDesc.do;jsessionid=1ADB525E82D520F3CE8B1393F0EAA914?id=11605]</ref>  These issues include cultural and linguistic preservation, [[land rights]], ownership and exploitation of natural resources, political determination and autonomy, environmental degradation and incursion, poverty, health, and discrimination.\n\nThe interaction between indigenous and non-indigenous societies throughout history has been complex, ranging from outright conflict and subjugation to some degree of mutual benefit and cultural transfer. A particular aspect of [[Anthropology|anthropological study]] involves investigation into the ramifications of what is termed [[First contact (anthropology)|''first contact'']], the study of what occurs when two cultures first encounter one another. The situation can be further confused when there is a complicated or contested history of migration and population of a given region, which can give rise to disputes about primacy and ownership of the land and resources.\n\nWherever indigenous cultural identity is asserted, common societal issues and concerns arise from the indigenous status. These concerns are often not unique to indigenous groups. Despite the diversity of indigenous peoples, it may be noted that they share common problems and issues in dealing with the prevailing, or invading, society. They are generally concerned that the cultures of indigenous peoples are being lost and that indigenous peoples suffer both discrimination and pressure to assimilate into their surrounding societies. This is borne out by the fact that the lands and cultures of nearly all of the peoples listed at the end of this article are under threat. Notable exceptions are the [[Yakuts|Sakha]] and [[Komi peoples]] (two northern [[indigenous peoples of Russia]]), who now control their own autonomous republics within the Russian state, and the Canadian [[Inuit]], who form a majority of the territory of [[Nunavut]] (created in 1999). Despite the control of their territories, many Sakha people have lost their lands as a result of the [[Russian Homestead Act]], which allows any Russian citizen to own any land in the Far Eastern region of Russia. In Australia, a landmark case, ''Mabo'' v ''Queensland'' (No 2),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCATrans/1991/23.pdf|title=Mabo v Queensland|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref> saw the High Court of Australia reject the idea of {{Lang|la|terra nullius}}.

This situation can persist even in the case where the indigenous population outnumbers that of the other inhabitants of the region or state; the defining notion here is one of separation from decision and regulatory processes that have some, at least titular, influence over aspects of their community and [[land rights]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/indigenouspeoples|title=Indigenous Peoples|website=World Bank|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nIn a ground-breaking 1997 decision involving the [[Ainu people#Litigation|Ainu people]] of Japan, the Japanese courts recognized their claim in law, stating that \"If one minority group lived in an area prior to being ruled over by a majority group and preserved its distinct ethnic culture even after being ruled over by the majority group, while another came to live in an area ruled over by a majority after consenting to the majority rule, it must be recognized that it is only natural that the distinct ethnic culture of the former group requires greater consideration.\"<ref>Judgment of the Sapporo District Court, Civil Division No. 3, 27 March 1997, in (1999) 38 ILM, p. 419</ref>\n\nIn Russia, definition of \"indigenous peoples\" is contested largely referring to a number of population (less than 50 000 people), and neglecting self-identification, origin from indigenous populations who inhabited the country or region upon invasion, colonization or establishment of state frontiers, distinctive social, economic and cultural institutions.<ref>IWGIA (2012).

These peoples inhabited lands surrounding the [[Aegean Sea]] before the subsequent migrations of the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] ancestors claimed by these authors. The disposition and precise identity of this former group is elusive, and sources such as [[Homer]], [[Hesiod]] and [[Herodotus]] give varying, partially mythological accounts. However, it is clear that cultures existed whose indigenous characteristics were distinguished by the subsequent Hellenic cultures (and distinct from non-Greek speaking \"foreigners\", termed \"[[barbarian]]s\" by the historical Greeks).\n\n[[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] society flourished between 250&nbsp;BCE and 480&nbsp;CE and commanded successive waves of conquests that gripped more than half of the globe. But because already existent populations within other parts of Europe at the time of [[classical antiquity]] had more in common culturally speaking with the Greco-Roman world, the intricacies involved in expansion across the European frontier were not so contentious relative to indigenous issues.<ref>Hall, Gillette, and Harry Anthony Patrinos. Indigenous Peoples, Poverty and Human Development in Latin America. New York: Palgrave MacMillan, n.d. Google Scholar. Web. 11 Mar. 2013</ref>\n\nHowever, when it came to expansion in other parts of the world, namely Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, then totally new cultural dynamics had entered into the equation, and this expansion became a forerunner of what was to take the Americas, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific by storm in more recent times. Thus, the idea that expansionist societies may encounter peoples who possess cultural customs and racial appearances strikingly different from those of the colonizing power was not new to the [[Renaissance]] or the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].\n\n[[File:AlonsoFernandezdeLugo2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Lugo]] presenting the captured [[Guanches|Guanche]] kings of [[Tenerife]] to [[Ferdinand and Isabella]].]]\n\n===European expansion and colonialism===\n{{See also|Columbian exchange}}\nThe rapid and extensive spread of the various European powers from the early 15th century onward had a profound impact upon many of the indigenous cultures with whom they came into contact. The [[Age of Discovery|exploratory]] and colonial ventures in the Americas, Africa, Asia and the Pacific often resulted in territorial and cultural conflict, and the intentional or unintentional displacement and devastation of the indigenous populations.\n\nEncounters between explorers and indigenous populations in the rest of the world often introduced new [[Infection|infectious diseases]], which sometimes caused local epidemics of extraordinary virulence. For example, [[smallpox]], [[measles]], malaria, yellow fever, and others were unknown in pre-Columbian America and Australia.\n\nThe [[Canary Islands]] had an indigenous population called the [[Guanches]] whose origin is still the subject of discussion among historians and linguists.<ref>[https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/oldwrld/colonists/canary.html Old World Contacts/Colonists/Canary Islands] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013124301/http://ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/oldwrld/colonists/canary.html |date=13 October 2007 }}.

Many indigenous populations have undergone a dramatic decline and even extinction, and remain threatened in many parts of the world. Some have also been assimilated by other populations or have undergone many other changes. In other cases, indigenous populations are undergoing a recovery or expansion in numbers.\n\nCertain indigenous societies survive even though they may no longer inhabit their \"traditional\" lands, owing to migration, relocation, forced resettlement or having been supplanted by other cultural groups.  In many other respects, the [[transformation of culture]] of indigenous groups is ongoing, and includes permanent loss of language, loss of lands, encroachment on traditional territories, and disruption in traditional ways of life due to contamination and pollution of waters and lands.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Environmental and economic benefits of having indigenous peoples tend land===\n{{See also|Climate change and indigenous peoples}}\nA WRI report mentions that \u201ctenure-secure\u201d indigenous lands generates billions and sometimes trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of benefits in the form of carbon sequestration, reduced pollution, clean water and more.

Since the late 20th century these peoples have increasingly sought recognition of their rights as distinct indigenous peoples, in both national and international contexts.\n\nThough the vast majority of African peoples are indigenous in the sense that they originate from that continent, in practice, identity as an ''indigenous people'' per the modern definition is more restrictive, and certainly not every African ethnic group claims identification under these terms. Groups and communities who do claim this recognition are those who, by a variety of historical and environmental circumstances, have been placed outside of the dominant state systems, and whose traditional practices and land claims often come into conflict with the objectives and policies implemented by governments, companies and surrounding dominant societies.\n\n===Americas===\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\n{{See also|:Category:Indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\n[[File:Quechuawomanandchild.jpg|thumb|left|[[Quechuas|Quechua]] woman and child in the [[Sacred Valley]], Andes, Peru.]]\nIndigenous peoples of the American continent are broadly recognized as being those groups and their descendants who inhabited the region before the arrival of European colonizers and settlers (i.e., [[Pre-Columbian]]). Indigenous peoples who maintain, or seek to maintain, traditional ways of life are found from the high Arctic north to the southern extremities of [[Tierra del Fuego]].\n\nThe impact of [[European colonization of the Americas]] on the indigenous communities has been in general quite severe, with many authorities estimating ranges of significant [[Population history of American indigenous peoples|population decline]] primarily due to disease but also violence. The extent of this impact is the subject of much continuing debate. Several peoples shortly thereafter became extinct, or very nearly so.\n\nAll nations in North and South America have populations of indigenous peoples within their borders. In some countries (particularly in Latin American), indigenous peoples form a sizable component of the overall national population \u2014 in Bolivia they account for an estimated 56\u201370% of the total nation, and at least half of the population in Guatemala and the Andean and Amazonian nations of Peru. In English, indigenous peoples are collectively referred to by different names that vary by region and include such ethnonyms as [[Native Americans (Americas)|Native Americans]], [[Amerindians]], and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]]. In Spanish or Portuguese speaking countries one finds the use of terms such as ''pueblos [[wikt:ind\u00edgena|ind\u00edgenas]]'', ''amerindios'', ''povos nativos'', ''povos ind\u00edgenas'', and, in Peru, ''Comunidades Nativas'' (Native Communities), particularly among Amazonian societies like the [[Urarina]]<ref>Dean, Bartholomew 2009 ''Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia'', Gainesville: University Press of Florida {{ISBN|978-0-8130-3378-5}} [http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07]</ref> and [[Mats\u00e9s]].

In New Zealand pre-contact Maori peoples were not a single people, thus the more recent grouping into tribal (iwi) arrangements has become a more formal arrangement in more recent times. Many Maori national leaders signed a treaty with the British, the [[Treaty of Waitangi]], which formed the modern geo-political entity that is New Zealand.\n\nA majority of the [[Papua New Guinea]] (PNG) population is indigenous, with more than 700 different nationalities recognized out of a total population of 8 million.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-15436981|title=Papua New Guinea country profile|date=2018|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en-GB}}</ref> The country's Constitution and key statutes identify traditional or custom-based practices and land tenure, and explicitly set out to promote the viability of these traditional societies within the modern state.

The situation can be further confused when there is a complicated or contested history of migration and population of a given region, which can give rise to disputes about primacy and ownership of the land and resources.\n\nWherever indigenous cultural identity is asserted, common societal issues and concerns arise from the indigenous status. These concerns are often not unique to indigenous groups. Despite the diversity of indigenous peoples, it may be noted that they share common problems and issues in dealing with the prevailing, or invading, society. They are generally concerned that the cultures of indigenous peoples are being lost and that indigenous peoples suffer both discrimination and pressure to assimilate into their surrounding societies. This is borne out by the fact that the lands and cultures of nearly all of the peoples listed at the end of this article are under threat. Notable exceptions are the [[Yakuts|Sakha]] and [[Komi peoples]] (two northern [[indigenous peoples of Russia]]), who now control their own autonomous republics within the Russian state, and the Canadian [[Inuit]], who form a majority of the territory of [[Nunavut]] (created in 1999). Despite the control of their territories, many Sakha people have lost their lands as a result of the [[Russian Homestead Act]], which allows any Russian citizen to own any land in the Far Eastern region of Russia. In Australia, a landmark case, ''Mabo'' v ''Queensland'' (No 2),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCATrans/1991/23.pdf|title=Mabo v Queensland|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref> saw the High Court of Australia reject the idea of {{Lang|la|terra nullius}}. This rejection ended up recognizing that there was a pre-existing system of law practised by the Meriam people.\n\nA 2009 United Nations publication says \"''Although indigenous peoples are often portrayed as a hindrance to development, their cultures and traditional knowledge are also increasingly seen as assets. It is argued that it is important for the human species as a whole to preserve as wide a range of [[cultural diversity]] as possible, and that the protection of indigenous cultures is vital to this enterprise.\"''<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Human rights violations===\n\nThe Bangladesh Government has stated that there are \"no indigenous peoples in Bangladesh.\"<ref name=\"Shafiq\">[http://bdnews24.com/details.php?id=198775&cid=3 No 'indigenous', reiterates Shafique] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319055434/http://bdnews24.com/details.php?id=198775&cid=3 |date=19 March 2012 }}. bdnews24.com (18 June 2011).

Some philosophers, such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588-1679), considered indigenous people to be merely \"savages\". Others (especially literary figures in the 18th century) popularised the concept of \"[[noble savage]]s\". Those who were close to the Hobbesian view tended to believe themselves to have a duty to \"civilize\" and \"modernize\" the indigenous.
