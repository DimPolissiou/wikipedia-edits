While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays. Ritter graduated in 1970.<ref name=lipton>{{cite magazine| last=Lipton| first=Michael A.| title=Acting His Age| url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| magazine=People| date=December 16, 2002| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107160642/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| archivedate=November 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Film and television===\n[[File:John Ritter 1977.jpg|thumb|Ritter as [[Jack Tripper]], 1977]]\nRitter headlined several stage performances. After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays.

After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

[[Sparta]] and its allies defeated an army led by [[Argos]] and [[Athens]].\n\n==Prelude to the battle==\nAfter the conclusion of the alliance between the Argives, Achaeans, Eleans and Athens, the humiliation of the Spartans in the 420 [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]]<ref>Elis vetoed the Spartan participation, preventing them from making due sacrifices at Zeus temple (Thucydides, ''[[The History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' 5:49-50)</ref> and the invasion of [[Epidaurus]] by the allies, the Spartans were compelled to move against them, fearing an alliance with Corinth and having amassed an army that was, according to [[Thucydides]], 'the best army ever assembled in Greece to that time'. However, the Spartan king [[Agis II|Agis]] (son of [[Archidamus II|Archidamus]]) instead concluded the first campaign with a truce, without explaining his actions to the army or his allies; the army thus returned home. Immediately afterwards, the Argives denounced the truce and resumed the war, capturing the key town of [[Orchomenus (Arcadia)|Orchomenus]]; as a result, anger at Agis was such that he was on the verge of being fined 100,000 [[drachma]]s and having his house destroyed.  Agis managed to forestall this punishment, promising to redeem himself with a victory elsewhere.<ref>Thucydides, ''The History of the Peloponnesian War'' 5:63</ref>  The [[ephors]] consented, but in an unprecedented move, placed Agis under the supervision of ten advisors, called ''[[xymbouloi]]'', whose consent was required for whatever military action he wished to take.\n\n==The battle==\nLate in 418, the Argives and their allies marched against [[Tegea]], where a faction was ready to turn the city over to the [[Argive alliance]]. Tegea   controlled the exit from Laconia. Enemy control of the town would mean that the Spartans would be unable to move out of their home city and would effectively mean the demise of the Peloponnesian coalition that fought the [[Peloponnesian War#The \"Archidamian War\"|Archidamian War]].\n\nAgis marched the whole of the Spartan army, together with the [[neodamodeis]] and everyone who was able to fight in Sparta out to [[Tegea]] where he was joined by his allies from [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadia]], and he sent for help from his northern allies, [[ancient Corinth|Corinth]], [[Boeotia]], [[Phocis]], and [[Locris]]. However, the northern army could not arrive quickly to the scene, as they had not expected the call and would have to pass through enemy territory (Argos and Orchomenus). On the whole, the army of the allies of Sparta would have numbered around 9,000 hoplites.\n\nIn the meantime, the Eleans decided to attack [[Lepreum]], a contested border town with Sparta. So, they chose to withdraw their contingent of 3,000 hoplites. Agis took advantage of it and sent a sixth of his army, with the youngest and the oldest hoplites home to guard Sparta proper. They were called back soon after, as Agis or the xymbouloi realized that the Eleans would soon be back on the side of the Argives, but did not arrive in time for the battle.\n\nAgis could have bided his time inside the walls of Tegea, waiting for his northern allies. However, he was already discredited and could not show the slightest sign of shying away from battle. So he invaded and ravaged the territory around [[Mantinea]], about 15&nbsp;km north of Tegea and a member of the Argive alliance, in order to force a pitched battle with the Argives and their allies. The Argive army, however, was situated on ground \"steep and hard to get at\" and would not be drawn into battle, probably because the grain harvest had already been stored (the battle probably took place in the end of September 418). Agis, who was desperate for a victory to redeem his embarrassment at Argos, charged ahead; but according to Thucydides, when the armies had closed to a stone's throw, \"one of the elder Spartans\"<ref>Thucydides, ''History of the Peloponnesian War'' 5:65</ref> (the [[xymboulos]] [[Pharax]], according to Diodorus<ref>Diodorus Siculus, ''Library'' 12.79.6</ref>) advised him not to try to correct one error (his former defeat) with another.  The Spartans therefore retreated, and went off to find a way to draw out the Argive army to a battle. So they diverted the Sarandapotamos River to the bed of the smaller Zanovistas river, or, they just filled up the sinkholes in which Zanovistas flowed, in order to flood the Mantinean territory.\n\nInstead of allowing Mantinea to be flooded, the Argive army moved more quickly than the Spartans anticipated, as the Argive hoplites were very angry at their generals for not pursuing the Spartan army and accused them of treason. They surprised their enemies by drawing up as the Spartans emerged from a nearby wood. The Spartans quickly organized themselves, with no time to wait for their other allies. Brasidas' veterans (Brasidas himself had been killed at the [[Battle of Amphipolis]]), and the [[Sciritae]] (an elite unit of Spartan troops) formed the left wing, the Spartans, Arcadians, Heraeans and [[Maenalon|Maenalians]] in the centre, and the Tegeans, who were fighting for their homeland took the position of honour on the right wing. The Argive lines were formed by the Mantineans on the right, the Argives in the centre, and the Athenians on the left. [[Thucydides]] did not know the exact numbers of men on each side, but estimated that there were about 9,000 men on the Spartan side (the Spartan army must have numbered about 3,500, with 600 Sciritae, about 2,000 neodamodeis and Brasideans and about 3,000 Arcadians on the whole) with somewhat fewer men on the Argive and Athenian side (about 8,000), according to [[Donald Kagan]]. Other scholars, such as [[Victor Davis Hanson]], give slightly bigger numbers.\n\nAs the battle began, each side's right wing began to outflank the other's left, due to the erratic movements of each [[hoplite]] trying to cover himself with the shield of the man beside him. Agis tried to strengthen the line by ordering the Sciritae and his left to break off contact from the rest of the army and match the length of the Argive line. To cover the void created, he ordered the companies of Hipponoidas and Aristocles to leave their positions in the center and cover the line. This however was not achieved, for the two captains were unable, or unwilling to complete these manoeuvres on such short notice. This kind of manoeuvre was unprecedented in the history of Greek warfare. Donald Kagan considers it a most ill-advised move and gives credit to the two captains for disobeying orders that would have probably lost the battle for the Spartans. Others consider it a move that could have succeeded.\n\nIn any case, the Mantineans and the right part of the Argives, the elite Argive Thousand entered the gap and routed the Brasideans and the Sciritae and pursued them for a long distance. In the meantime, the Tegeans and the regular Spartan army routed the Athenians and the Arcadians that formed the left part of the Argive army. Most of them did not even stand to fight, but they fled as the Spartans approached; some were even trampled in their hurry to get away before the enemy reached them.\n\nThen the Spartans turned left and broke the Argive right which fled in total disarray. The Spartans did not pursue the enemy for long after the battle was won.\n\n--gay--\nThe Argive side lost about 1,100 men (700 Argives and Arcadians, 200 Athenians and 200 Mantineans) and the Spartans about 300.\n\nThe Spartans sent an embassy to Argos and the Argives accepted a truce by the terms of which they gave up Orchomenus, all their hostages and joined up with the Spartans in evicting the Athenians from Epidaurus. They also renounced their alliance with Elis and Athens.

[[Sparta]] and its allies defeated an army led by [[Argos]] and [[Athens]].\n\n==Prelude to the battle==\nAfter the conclusion of the alliance between the Argives, Achaeans, Eleans and Athens, the humiliation of the Spartans in the 420 [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]]<ref>Elis vetoed the Spartan participation, preventing them from making due sacrifices at Zeus temple (Thucydides, ''[[The History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' 5:49-50)</ref> and the invasion of [[Epidaurus]] by the allies, the Spartans were compelled to move against them, fearing an alliance with Corinth and having amassed an army that was, according to [[Thucydides]], 'the best army ever assembled in Greece to that time'. However, the Spartan king [[Agis II|Agis]] (son of [[Archidamus II|Archidamus]]) instead concluded the first campaign with a truce, without explaining his actions to the army or his allies; the army thus returned home. Immediately afterwards, the Argives denounced the truce and resumed the war, capturing the key town of [[Orchomenus (Arcadia)|Orchomenus]]; as a result, anger at Agis was such that he was on the verge of being fined 100,000 [[drachma]]s and having his house destroyed.  Agis managed to forestall this punishment, promising to redeem himself with a victory elsewhere.<ref>Thucydides, ''The History of the Peloponnesian War'' 5:63</ref>  The [[ephors]] consented, but in an unprecedented move, placed Agis under the supervision of ten advisors, called ''[[xymbouloi]]'', whose consent was required for whatever military action he wished to take.\n\n==The battle==\nLate in 418, the Argives and their allies marched against [[Tegea]], where a faction was ready to turn the city over to the [[Argive alliance]]. Tegea   controlled the exit from Laconia. Enemy control of the town would mean that the Spartans would be unable to move out of their home city and would effectively mean the demise of the Peloponnesian coalition that fought the [[Peloponnesian War#The \"Archidamian War\"|Archidamian War]].\n\nAgis marched the whole of the Spartan army, together with the [[neodamodeis]] and everyone who was able to fight in Sparta out to [[Tegea]] where he was joined by his allies from [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadia]], and he sent for help from his northern allies, [[ancient Corinth|Corinth]], [[Boeotia]], [[Phocis]], and [[Locris]]. However, the northern army could not arrive quickly to the scene, as they had not expected the call and would have to pass through enemy territory (Argos and Orchomenus). On the whole, the army of the allies of Sparta would have numbered around 9,000 hoplites.\n\nIn the meantime, the Eleans decided to attack [[Lepreum]], a contested border town with Sparta. So, they chose to withdraw their contingent of 3,000 hoplites. Agis took advantage of it and sent a sixth of his army, with the youngest and the oldest hoplites home to guard Sparta proper. They were called back soon after, as Agis or the xymbouloi realized that the Eleans would soon be back on the side of the Argives, but did not arrive in time for the battle.\n\nAgis could have bided his time inside the walls of Tegea, waiting for his northern allies. However, he was already discredited and could not show the slightest sign of shying away from battle. So he invaded and ravaged the territory around [[Mantinea]], about 15&nbsp;km north of Tegea and a member of the Argive alliance, in order to force a pitched battle with the Argives and their allies. The Argive army, however, was situated on ground \"steep and hard to get at\" and would not be drawn into battle, probably because the grain harvest had already been stored (the battle probably took place in the end of September 418). Agis, who was desperate for a victory to redeem his embarrassment at Argos, charged ahead; but according to Thucydides, when the armies had closed to a stone's throw, \"one of the elder Spartans\"<ref>Thucydides, ''History of the Peloponnesian War'' 5:65</ref> (the [[xymboulos]] [[Pharax]], according to Diodorus<ref>Diodorus Siculus, ''Library'' 12.79.6</ref>) advised him not to try to correct one error (his former defeat) with another.  The Spartans therefore retreated, and went off to find a way to draw out the Argive army to a battle. So they diverted the Sarandapotamos River to the bed of the smaller Zanovistas river, or, they just filled up the sinkholes in which Zanovistas flowed, in order to flood the Mantinean territory.\n\nInstead of allowing Mantinea to be flooded, the Argive army moved more quickly than the Spartans anticipated, as the Argive hoplites were very angry at their generals for not pursuing the Spartan army and accused them of treason. They surprised their enemies by drawing up as the Spartans emerged from a nearby wood. The Spartans quickly organized themselves, with no time to wait for their other allies. Brasidas' veterans (Brasidas himself had been killed at the [[Battle of Amphipolis]]), and the [[Sciritae]] (an elite unit of Spartan troops) formed the left wing, the Spartans, Arcadians, Heraeans and [[Maenalon|Maenalians]] in the centre, and the Tegeans, who were fighting for their homeland took the position of honour on the right wing. The Argive lines were formed by the Mantineans on the right, the Argives in the centre, and the Athenians on the left. [[Thucydides]] did not know the exact numbers of men on each side, but estimated that there were about 9,000 men on the Spartan side (the Spartan army must have numbered about 3,500, with 600 Sciritae, about 2,000 neodamodeis and Brasideans and about 3,000 Arcadians on the whole) with somewhat fewer men on the Argive and Athenian side (about 8,000), according to [[Donald Kagan]]. Other scholars, such as [[Victor Davis Hanson]], give slightly bigger numbers.\n\nAs the battle began, each side's right wing began to outflank the other's left, due to the erratic movements of each [[hoplite]] trying to cover himself with the shield of the man beside him. Agis tried to strengthen the line by ordering the Sciritae and his left to break off contact from the rest of the army and match the length of the Argive line. To cover the void created, he ordered the companies of Hipponoidas and Aristocles to leave their positions in the center and cover the line. This however was not achieved, for the two captains were unable, or unwilling to complete these manoeuvres on such short notice. This kind of manoeuvre was unprecedented in the history of Greek warfare. Donald Kagan considers it a most ill-advised move and gives credit to the two captains for disobeying orders that would have probably lost the battle for the Spartans. Others consider it a move that could have succeeded.\n\nIn any case, the Mantineans and the right part of the Argives, the elite Argive Thousand entered the gap and routed the Brasideans and the Sciritae and pursued them for a long distance. In the meantime, the Tegeans and the regular Spartan army routed the Athenians and the Arcadians that formed the left part of the Argive army. Most of them did not even stand to fight, but they fled as the Spartans approached; some were even trampled in their hurry to get away before the enemy reached them.\n\nThen the Spartans turned left and broke the Argive right which fled in total disarray. The Spartans did not pursue the enemy for long after the battle was won.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Argive side lost about 1,100 men (700 Argives and Arcadians, 200 Athenians and 200 Mantineans) and the Spartans about 300.\n\nThe Spartans sent an embassy to Argos and the Argives accepted a truce by the terms of which they gave up Orchomenus, all their hostages and joined up with the Spartans in evicting the Athenians from Epidaurus. They also renounced their alliance with Elis and Athens. After deposing the democratic government of Sicyon, the Argive Thousand staged a coup against the democratic rule of Argos, where the democrats' morale was low, because of the bad performance of the common army and the Athenians in the battle. \n\nIn more general terms, the battle was a considerable boost to the Lacedaemonians' morale and prestige, since after the disaster at Pylos they had been considered cowardly and incompetent in battle. Their success at Mantinea marked a reversal of the trend.\n\n==Sources==\n*Thucydides, ''The Peloponnesian War''. Athens, Philippos Pappas, Nikolaos Philippas; Athens, Papyros. 1953.\n*Kagan, Donald.

their curricula differ in that they emphasize the works of their respective [[Rebbe]]. \nParallel to their academic content, most Seminaries also focus on [[Hashkafa#Gender_roles|the role of women in Torah]] - covering topics such as ''[[Tzniut]]'' (modesty), ''[[Shalom Bayit]]'' (\"domestic peace\") and ''[[Chinuch]]'' (education of one's children) - with these classes emphasizing ''values'', as opposed to sources. <ref name=\"Lilith\"/>\n(Several ''Midrashot'' similarly.<ref name =\"tal\"/>)\n\nMany diaspora-based Orthodox Jewish girls attend a ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrasha}}'', or \u201csem\u201d, in Israel for a year or more following high school; \nseveral ''midrashot'' and seminaries offer special programs, for example ''Shana Ba'aretz'' at Nishmat, or  the \"Overseas Program\" at [[Midreshet HaRova]].\nAdditional to Torah study, these usually include <ref name=\"Lilith\"/> [[Tourism_in_Israel|touring of Israel]], [[Shabbaton]]s in various communities, and often volunteer work in local schools and hospitals, and seminars with journalists and politicians.\nSome institutions accommodate  [[baal teshuva|the newly observant]] with similar year-programs, designed to build knowledge and skills;

\nthese institutions then also assign less weight to textual skills,<ref name=\"Lilith\"/> with content delivered primarily via lecture.\n(See [[Bais Yaakov #Curriculum]], [[Women in Judaism #Yisrael Meir Kagan]].)\n[[Bais_Yaakov#Hasidic_schools|Hasidic-aligned institutions]], for example [[Beth Rivkah]], are similarly positioned; their curricula differ in that they emphasize the works of their respective [[Rebbe]]. \nParallel to their academic content, most Seminaries also focus on [[Hashkafa#Gender_roles|the role of women in Torah]] - covering topics such as ''[[Tzniut]]'' (modesty), ''[[Shalom Bayit]]'' (\"domestic peace\") and ''[[Chinuch]]'' (education of one's children) - with these classes emphasizing ''values'', as opposed to sources. <ref name=\"Lilith\"/>\n(Several ''Midrashot'' similarly.<ref name =\"tal\"/>)\n\nMany diaspora-based Orthodox Jewish girls attend a ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrasha}}'', or \u201csem\u201d, in Israel for a year or more following high school; \nseveral ''midrashot'' and seminaries offer special programs, for example ''Shana Ba'aretz'' at Nishmat, or  the \"Overseas Program\" at [[Midreshet HaRova]].\nAdditional to Torah study, these usually include <ref name=\"Lilith\"/> [[Tourism_in_Israel|touring of Israel]], [[Shabbaton]]s in various communities, and often volunteer work in local schools and hospitals, and seminars with journalists and politicians.\nSome institutions accommodate  [[baal teshuva|the newly observant]] with similar year-programs, designed to build knowledge and skills; well known are [[Neve Yerushalayim]], [[Mayanot]], and [[Machon Roni]].\n\n===Certifications===\nIn the Religious Zionist community women often continue their studies at one of the midrasha-affiliated [[List_of_universities_and_colleges_in_Israel#Colleges|teacher training colleges]], which offer a Torah-program in conjunction with the [[B.Ed.]] degree; \n([[masters degree|masters' level]]) specializations are often offered in ''Tanakh''  or ''Machshavah''. \n[[Bar-Ilan University]] operates a ''midrasha'', and students in all disciplines may then continue Torah study in parallel with their academic studies (with a requirement of at least seven courses in Judaism<ref>[https://midrasha.biu.ac.il/en/node/406 Bar-Ilan ''Midrasha'']</ref>).\n[[Machon Tal]], <ref name =\"tal\">[https://www.jct.ac.il/%d7%a7%d7%9e%d7%a4%d7%95%d7%a1%d7%99%d7%9d/%d7%a7%d7%9e%d7%a4%d7%95%d7%a1-%d7%98%d7%9c/%d7%9e%d7%93%d7%a8%d7%a9%d7%aa-%d7%98%d7%9c/%d7%90%d7%95%d7%93%d7%95%d7%aa \u05de\u05d3\u05e8\u05e9\u05ea-\u05d8\u05dc], jct.ac.il</ref> associated with JCT, the [[Jerusalem College of Technology]], similarly offers degrees in engineering and management. \n\nMost Haredi and Hasidic seminaries likewise offer certificates, and sometimes degrees, in Education. \nThe two year certificates are through the [[:he:\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df \u05d4\u05e0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d9\u05d8\u05d4 \u05e1\u05d0\u05dc\u05d3 |Szold Institute]], and are recognized by the [[Israel Ministry of Education]] as equivalent to the [[bagrut|national matriculation]].<ref>[https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/1395928/ministry-education-recognizes-teaching-certificates-matriculation-paves-way-charedi-women-pursue-college-israel.html discussion in the theyeshivaworld.com]</ref>\nBeth Rivkah offers a B.Ed. jointly with the [[:He:\u05e9\u05d0\u05e0\u05df_-_\u05d4\u05de\u05db\u05dc\u05dc\u05d4_\u05d4\u05d0\u05e7\u05d3\u05de\u05d9\u05ea_\u05d4\u05d3\u05ea\u05d9\u05ea_\u05dc\u05d7\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5\u05da|Shaanan Religious College of Education]].\n[[Jerusalem_College_of_Technology#Branches|JCT's Lustig Campus]] in [[Ramat Gan]] hosts degree programs for Haredi and Hasidic women;\nsee also [[The Haredi Campus - The Academic College Ono]].\n\nMost ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot}}'' for English-speaking students are accredited by American colleges; see [[Yeshiva #College credit]]. \nSome ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot}}'' offer second-year programs with religious-studies classes in the morning and general-studies classes in the afternoons, allowing students to pursue a religious education and a general-studies education leading to a college degree simultaneously.\nThe Modern Orthodox [[Stern College for Women]] - in Manhattan, New York - combines Torah and University studies, as at Bar-Ilan;\nthe Haredi [[Touro_College_and_University_System#Undergraduate_schools|Lander College for Women]] similarly.\n\n==Other Programs==\nAs above, the term ''Midrasha'' is sometimes used for [[Cultural Judaism|pluralistic]], as opposed to [[orthodox Judaism|orthodox]], institutions.
