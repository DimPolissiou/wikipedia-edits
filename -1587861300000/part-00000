He is a member of the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], won four [[Stanley Cup]]s,  was [[captain (ice hockey)|captain]] of the Canadiens for eight years and was voted to the [[NHL All-Star Team]] four times. Although having a reputation as a clean player, he was also one of the strongest players and best body-checkers of his era. He excelled as a defensive defenceman, had superior passing skills and was known for his leadership and mentoring of younger players. In his early years in the NHL, Bouchard was one of the players who made a major contribution to reinvigorating what was at the time an ailing Canadien franchise.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Douglas|title=\nChampions: the illustrated history of hockey's greatest dynasties|publisher=Penguin Group|year=1997}}</ref><ref name=\"hhof_bio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p196603&type=Player&page=bio&list=#photo|title=Butch Bouchard Biography|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|accessdate=12 August 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"hab_hero\">{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Ken|title=Hab Heroes: the greatest Canadiens ever from 1 to 100 (Hockey News)|publisher=Transcontinental Books|page=115|isbn=978-0-9809924-0-3}}</ref>\n\nHe was born in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], and at the time his death resided in [[Saint-Lambert, Quebec]].

I can respond to players, not be a yes-man for the proprietor.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=Chris|last=Mcdonell|title=Hockey Allstars: the NHL honor roll|publisher=Firefly Books|page=31|year=2000}}</ref> He missed a large part of the 1948\u201349 season after a severe knee injury which threatened his career. Despite medical opinion that he might not be able to continue to play he trained hard and was able to strengthen the knee enough to return to the Canadiens.<ref name=\"hhof\"/>\n\nIn 1951, Bouchard was involved in a legal first when he was a defendant in a lawsuit brought by a [[New York Rangers]] fan. The fan claimed Bouchard had struck him with his stick when he was waving to a friend watching the game on TV. Bouchard said the fan had actually raised his fist towards a fellow Canadiens player who was being taken off the ice with an injury and his stick hit the fan accidentally as he tried to ward off the blow. In what may have been the first time in legal history, evidence was taken during a trial from someone witnessing an event on a television as the fan's friend testified he'd seen Bouchard strike the blow. Bouchard won the case when Otis Guernsey, president of [[History of Abercrombie & Fitch|Abercrombie and Fitch]], who was at the game testified he heard \"vile language\" and saw the fan raise his fist and not wave.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Montreal Gazette|date=30 January 1951|title=Television Testimony Doesn't Help;Butch Bouchard Cleared|author=New York Times Service|page=16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Day (New London Evening Day)|agency=Associated Press|date=30 January 1951|title=TV Evidence Accepted in Hockey Suit|page=6}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 February 1953, the Canadiens had a \"Bouchard Night at the Forum\". Bouchard was honoured in a ceremony during the second intermission in a game against the Detroit Red Wings. It was presided over by Montreal Mayor [[Camillien Houde]] and broadcast nationally live over the CBC. Among the gifts Bouchard received was a Buick automobile which was driven out onto the ice. The organizer's plan was to have Bouchard drive off in the car at the end of the ceremony. However, sitting in the car Bouchard discovered the keys were missing. To the roar of the crowd [[Ted Lindsay]], captain of the Red Wings, returned the keys he had stolen and congratulated Bouchard on behalf of the Red Wings<ref name=\"Star_Feb28_53_Dunnell\"/><ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Montreal Gazette|date=2 March 1953|page=24|title=Crowds Demonstrate as Canadiens Lose to Detroit 4\u20133}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1952\u201353 NHL season|1952\u201353]], Montreal and Detroit battled for first place with Detroit coming out on top by the end of the season. In the first round of the playoffs the heavily favoured Detroit Red Wings were upset by the Boston Bruins and Montreal won a close seven-game series over the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]]. The Canadiens then defeated Boston in five games and Bouchard won his third Stanley Cup.<ref>{{cite web|title=1952-53 NHL Season Summary|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_1953.html|publisher=Sports Reference|accessdate=7 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nEventually injuries began to take their toll and at the conclusion of the 1954\u201355 season he considered retirement. Toe Blake, who had taken over as coach, talked him into playing one more season to assist the younger players. Bouchard recognized Blake's value as a \"player's coach\" and used his leadership as captain to ease the transition and encourage Blake's acceptance by the Canadiens players.<ref name=\"Denault\"/> Due to physical problems Bouchard was forced to miss the last half of the season and the playoffs. However, in the deciding game of the Stanley Cup final against Detroit, Blake dressed Bouchard.

They finished in fourth place with a record of 19 wins, 19 losses and 12 ties.

Richard was not just an exciting player to watch which served to increase attendance, but also had the offensive skills needed to turn the Canadiens into an exceptional team.<ref>{{cite web|title=Maurice Richard bio at Legends of Hockey|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p196108&type=Player&page=bio&list=#photo|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|accessdate=16 August 2009}}</ref> The Canadiens proceeded to dominate the regular season finishing well ahead of second-place Detroit. In the playoffs in the first round against [[Toronto Maple Leafs|Toronto]], after losing the opening game, they won the next four straight to win the series. Then, in the final they swept Detroit in four games to win their first [[Stanley Cup]] in thirteen years. While the [[Punch line (ice hockey)|\"Punch Line\"]] of Richard, [[Toe Blake]] and Lach provided the offensive power it was Bouchard and goal-tender [[Bill Durnan]] who kept the goals out.

He would be named to the NHL First All Star team, as one of the best defencemen in the league, for the next three seasons.<ref name=\"Total Hockey\"/> He won his second Stanley Cup in 1945\u201346.<ref name=\"hhof\"/>\n\nAs physical on the ice as Bouchard was, he was also regarded as a clean player and only rarely participated in [[Fighting in ice hockey|hockey fights]]. Immensely strong, most players avoided engaging him in fights and Bouchard more often would be the person to break up combatants.<ref name=\"hhof_bio\"/> However, it was a fight involving Bouchard which led to a significant change in the role of [[Official (ice hockey)|referees]]. During the 1946\u201347 season, Bouchard became involved in a prolonged and one-sided fight with Boston's [[Terry Reardon]]. Due to the fight, [[Clarence Campbell]], president of the NHL, added to the duties of referees; for the first time they had the responsibility of breaking up fights.<ref>{{cite book|title=Years of Glory: 1942\u20131967 the National Hockey League's official book of the six-team era|first=Dan|last=Diamond|year=1994|page=26|publisher=McClelland & Stewart Inc.|isbn=0-7710-2817-2}}</ref> Then there was the time in March 1947, in a game in Boston, as the Canadiens were coming back onto the ice for the beginning of the third period, a female fan attacked Bouchard spearing him with a hat pin. Bouchard responded by pushing the woman away forcefully. A few moments later, Boston police were leading Bouchard out to a police car. According to Bouchard, [[Pat Egan]] of the [[Boston Bruins]], interceded and talked the police out of the arrest.<ref>{{cite news|last=Carroll|first=Dink|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/48503840/p-16/|title=Playing the Field: Butch Is Pinched|date=31 March 1947|newspaper=[[Montreal Gazette|The Gazette]]|access-date=11 April 2020|url-status=live|location=Montreal|page=16}}</ref>\n\nFor the [[1947\u201348 NHL season|1947\u201348 season]], defenceman [[Doug Harvey (ice hockey)|Doug Harvey]] joined the team. Within a couple years Harvey would become the best offensive-oriented defenceman in the NHL and he and Bouchard would form a long-time and very effective defensive pairing.<ref name=\"hhof\"/> Whenever Harvey undertook one of the offensive rushes for which he became famous, he was confident in the knowledge that Bouchard was backing him up if he was to lose the puck.<ref name=\"hab_hero\"/>\n\n===Leader and mentor===\nIn 1948, Bouchard became the first Quebec-born [[captain (ice hockey)|captain]] of the Canadiens, a position he retained for eight years until his retirement. At the time of his retirement no player had served more years as captain of the Canadiens than Bouchard.<ref name=\"hab_hero\"/> Hall of Famer [[Jean B\u00e9liveau]], a teammate of Bouchard for Beliveau's early years with the Canadiens, said Bouchard was the model for his time as captain in the 1960s.<ref name=\"hhof\"/> Bouchard was a well-respected leader and played a role in supporting and mentoring the younger players.<ref name=\"hon_can\"/><ref name=\"Denault\">{{cite book|last=Denault|first=Todd|title=Jacques Plante|page=81|publisher=McClelland & Stewart|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7710-2633-1}}</ref> Never afraid to speak up to management, in 1950 on Bouchard's recommendation to Selke to \"give the kid a shot\", [[Bernie Geoffrion]] was given a tryout and eventually joined the Canadiens.<ref name=\"hhof\"/> Geoffrion won the [[Calder Memorial Trophy|Calder]] for rookie of the year and would be near the top of league scoring for years to come. Bouchard commenting on the fact that he was nominated for captain by his teammates: \"I don't agree with management nominating you. I can respond to players, not be a yes-man for the proprietor.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=Chris|last=Mcdonell|title=Hockey Allstars: the NHL honor roll|publisher=Firefly Books|page=31|year=2000}}</ref> He missed a large part of the 1948\u201349 season after a severe knee injury which threatened his career. Despite medical opinion that he might not be able to continue to play he trained hard and was able to strengthen the knee enough to return to the Canadiens.<ref name=\"hhof\"/>\n\nIn 1951, Bouchard was involved in a legal first when he was a defendant in a lawsuit brought by a [[New York Rangers]] fan. The fan claimed Bouchard had struck him with his stick when he was waving to a friend watching the game on TV. Bouchard said the fan had actually raised his fist towards a fellow Canadiens player who was being taken off the ice with an injury and his stick hit the fan accidentally as he tried to ward off the blow. In what may have been the first time in legal history, evidence was taken during a trial from someone witnessing an event on a television as the fan's friend testified he'd seen Bouchard strike the blow. Bouchard won the case when Otis Guernsey, president of [[History of Abercrombie & Fitch|Abercrombie and Fitch]], who was at the game testified he heard \"vile language\" and saw the fan raise his fist and not wave.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Montreal Gazette|date=30 January 1951|title=Television Testimony Doesn't Help;Butch Bouchard Cleared|author=New York Times Service|page=16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Day (New London Evening Day)|agency=Associated Press|date=30 January 1951|title=TV Evidence Accepted in Hockey Suit|page=6}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 February 1953, the Canadiens had a \"Bouchard Night at the Forum\". Bouchard was honoured in a ceremony during the second intermission in a game against the Detroit Red Wings. It was presided over by Montreal Mayor [[Camillien Houde]] and broadcast nationally live over the CBC. Among the gifts Bouchard received was a Buick automobile which was driven out onto the ice. The organizer's plan was to have Bouchard drive off in the car at the end of the ceremony. However, sitting in the car Bouchard discovered the keys were missing. To the roar of the crowd [[Ted Lindsay]], captain of the Red Wings, returned the keys he had stolen and congratulated Bouchard on behalf of the Red Wings<ref name=\"Star_Feb28_53_Dunnell\"/><ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Montreal Gazette|date=2 March 1953|page=24|title=Crowds Demonstrate as Canadiens Lose to Detroit 4\u20133}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1952\u201353 NHL season|1952\u201353]], Montreal and Detroit battled for first place with Detroit coming out on top by the end of the season. In the first round of the playoffs the heavily favoured Detroit Red Wings were upset by the Boston Bruins and Montreal won a close seven-game series over the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]]. The Canadiens then defeated Boston in five games and Bouchard won his third Stanley Cup.<ref>{{cite web|title=1952-53 NHL Season Summary|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_1953.html|publisher=Sports Reference|accessdate=7 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nEventually injuries began to take their toll and at the conclusion of the 1954\u201355 season he considered retirement. Toe Blake, who had taken over as coach, talked him into playing one more season to assist the younger players. Bouchard recognized Blake's value as a \"player's coach\" and used his leadership as captain to ease the transition and encourage Blake's acceptance by the Canadiens players.<ref name=\"Denault\"/> Due to physical problems Bouchard was forced to miss the last half of the season and the playoffs. However, in the deciding game of the Stanley Cup final against Detroit, Blake dressed Bouchard. As the final seconds counted down, with Montreal up 3\u20131, Blake put Bouchard on the ice and he was able to end his career with one more Stanley Cup celebration.<ref name=\"hhof\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1947, Bouchard married Marie-Claire Macbeth, a painter.<ref name=Star_CP_Apr1412>{{cite news|title=Emile (Butch) Bouchard, former Montreal Canadiens captain, dead at 92|publisher=The Star|author=Canadian Press|location=Toronto|date= 14 April 2012 |accessdate=14 April 2012|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/hockey/nhl/article/1161693--emile-butch-bouchard-former-montreal-canadiens-captain-dead-at-92}}</ref> They had five children, \u00c9mile Jr., Jean, Michel, Pierre and Susan.<ref name=\"EBB_bio\"/><ref name=\"RDS_Jan96\">{{cite web|author=RDS.ca|title=\u00c9MILE \"BUTCH\" BOUCHARD, HOCKEY|language=french|publisher=CTVglobemedia|url=http://www.rds.ca/pantheon/chroniques/204863.html|date=1 January 1996|accessdate=15 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, his son [[Pierre Bouchard]], also a defenceman, played for the Montreal Canadiens.

In 1957, after an [[International League]] game in Toronto between his Montreal Royals and the [[Toronto Maple Leafs (International League)|Maple Leafs baseball team]] President Bouchard complained about Toronto's excessive conference trips to the mound.

When the Mafia of the day in Montreal attempted to intimidate him into hiring their people for his restaurant, Bouchard invited the head man to Chez Butch Bouchard for dinner. Bouchard's wife, Marie-Claire, recalled he told them, \"Il lui a dit over my dead body.

{"title_page": "Quaternion algebra", "text_new": "{{Short description|generalization of quaternions to other fields}}\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''quaternion algebra''' over a field ''F'' is a [[central simple algebra]] ''A'' over ''F''<ref>See Peirce. Associative algebras. Springer. Lemma at page 14.</ref><ref>See Milies & Sehgal, An introduction to group rings, exercise 17, chapter 2.</ref> that has dimension 4 over ''F''. Every quaternion algebra becomes a matrix algebra by ''[[Scalar extension|extending scalars]]'' (equivalently, [[tensor product of algebras|tensoring]] with a field extension), i.e. for a suitable [[field extension]] ''K'' of ''F'', <math>A \\otimes_F K</math> is isomorphic to the 2\u00d72 [[matrix algebra]] over ''K''.\n\nThe notion of a quaternion algebra can be seen as a generalization of Hamilton's [[quaternion]]s to an arbitrary [[base field]]. The Hamilton quaternions are a quaternion algebra (in the above sense) over <math>F = \\mathbb{R}</math> (the [[real number field]]), and indeed the only one over <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> apart from the 2\u00d72 [[real matrix]] algebra, up to [[isomorphism]]. When <math>F = \\mathbb{C}</math>, then the [[biquaternion]]s form the quaternion algebra over ''F''.\n\n==Structure==\n''Quaternion algebra'' here means something more general than the algebra of Hamilton's [[quaternions]]. When the [[coefficient field]] ''F'' does not have characteristic 2, every quaternion algebra over ''F'' can be described as a 4-dimensional ''F''-[[vector space]] with basis <math>\\{ 1, i, j, k\\}</math>, with the following multiplication rules:\n:<math>i^2=a</math>\n:<math>j^2=b</math>\n:<math>ij=k</math>\n:<math>ji=-k</math>\n\nwhere ''a'' and ''b'' are any given nonzero elements of ''F''.  From these rules we get:\n:<math>k^2=ijij=-iijj=-ab</math>\n\nThe classical instances where <math>F=\\mathbb{R}</math> are Hamilton's quaternions (''a'' = ''b'' = \u22121) and [[split-quaternion]]s (''a'' = \u22121, ''b'' = +1). In split-quaternions, <math>k^2 = +1</math> and <math>j k = - i </math>, contrary to Hamilton's equations.\n\nThe algebra defined in this way is denoted (''a'',''b'')<sub>''F''</sub> or simply (''a'',''b'').<ref name=GS2>Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.2</ref>  When ''F'' has characteristic 2, a different explicit description in terms of a basis of 4 elements is also possible, but in any event the definition of a quaternion algebra over ''F'' as a 4-dimensional central simple algebra over ''F'' applies uniformly in all characteristics.\n\nA quaternion algebra (''a'',''b'')<sub>''F''</sub> is either a [[division algebra]] or isomorphic to the [[matrix algebra]] of 2\u00d72 matrices over ''F'': the latter case is termed ''split''.<ref name=GS3>Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.3</ref>  The ''norm form''\n:<math>N(t + xi +yj + zk) = t^2 - ax^2 - by^2 + abz^2 \\ </math>\ndefines a structure of [[division algebra]] if and only if the norm is an [[anisotropic quadratic form]], that is, zero only on the zero element.  The [[conic section|conic]] ''C''(''a'',''b'') defined by\n:<math>a x^2 + b y^2 = z^2 \\ </math>\nhas a point (''x'',''y'',''z'') with coordinates in ''F'' in the split case.<ref name=GS7>Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.7</ref>\n\n==Application==\nQuaternion algebras are applied in [[number theory]], particularly to [[quadratic form]]s. They are concrete structures that generate the elements of order two in the [[Brauer group]] of ''F''.  For some fields, including algebraic number fields, every element of order 2 in its Brauer group is represented by a quaternion algebra. A theorem of [[Alexander Merkurjev]] implies that each element of order 2 in the Brauer group of any field is represented by a [[tensor product]] of quaternion algebras.<ref name=Lam139>Lam (2005) p.139</ref>  In particular, over [[p-adic field|''p''-adic field]]s the construction of quaternion algebras can be viewed as the quadratic [[Hilbert symbol]] of [[local class field theory]].\n\n==Classification==\nIt is a theorem of [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius|Frobenius]] that there are only two real quaternion algebras: 2\u00d72 matrices over the reals and Hamilton's real quaternions.\n\nIn a similar way, over any [[local field]] ''F'' there are exactly two quaternion algebras: the 2\u00d72 matrices over ''F'' and a division algebra.\nBut the quaternion division algebra over a local field is usually ''not'' Hamilton's quaternions over the field.  For example, over the ''p''-adic numbers Hamilton's quaternions are a division algebra only when ''p'' is 2.  For odd prime ''p'', the ''p''-adic Hamilton quaternions are isomorphic to the 2\u00d72 matrices over the ''p''-adics. To see the ''p''-adic Hamilton quaternions are not a division algebra for odd prime ''p'', observe that the congruence ''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''y''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121 mod ''p'' is solvable and therefore by [[Hensel's lemma]] \u2014 here is where ''p'' being odd is needed \u2014 the equation\n\n:''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''y''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121\n\nis solvable in the ''p''-adic numbers. Therefore the quaternion\n\n:''xi'' + ''yj'' + ''k''\n\nhas norm 0 and hence doesn't have a [[multiplicative inverse]].\n\nOne way to classify the [[Algebra homomorphism|''F''-algebra isomorphism]] [[equivalence class|classes]] of all quaternion algebras for a given field, ''F'' is to use the one-to-one correspondence between isomorphism classes of quaternion algebras over ''F'' and isomorphism classes of their ''norm forms''.\n\nTo every quaternion algebra ''A'', one can associate a quadratic form ''N'' (called the ''[[norm form]]'') on ''A'' such that\n\n:<math>N(xy) = N(x)N(y)</math>\n\nfor all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''A''. It turns out that the possible norm forms for quaternion ''F''-algebras are exactly the [[Pfister form|Pfister 2-forms]].\n\n==Quaternion algebras over the rational numbers==\nQuaternion algebras over the rational numbers have an arithmetic theory similar to, but more complicated than, that of quadratic extensions of <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math>.\n\nLet <math>B</math> be a quaternion algebra over <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math> and let <math>\\nu</math> be a [[Place (mathematics)|place]] of <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math>, with completion <math>\\mathbb{Q}_\\nu</math>  (so it is either the ''p''-adic numbers <math>\\mathbb{Q}_p</math> for some prime ''p'' or the real numbers <math>\\mathbb{R}</math>).  Define <math>B_\\nu:= \\mathbb{Q}_\\nu \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Q}} B</math>, which is a quaternion algebra over <math>\\mathbb{Q}_\\nu</math>.  So there are two choices for\n<math>B_\\nu</math>:  the 2 by 2 matrices over <math>\\mathbb{Q}_\\nu</math> or a [[division algebra]].\n\nWe say that <math>B</math> is '''split''' (or '''unramified''') at <math>\\nu</math> if <math>B_\\nu</math> is isomorphic to the 2\u00d72 matrices over <math>\\mathbb{Q}_\\nu</math>.  We say that ''B'' is '''non-split''' (or '''ramified''') at <math>\\nu</math> if <math>B_\\nu</math> is the quaternion division algebra over <math>\\mathbb{Q}_\\nu</math>.  For example, the rational Hamilton quaternions is non-split at 2 and at <math>\\infty</math> and split at all odd primes. The rational 2 by 2 matrices are split at all places.\n\nA quaternion algebra over the rationals which splits at <math>\\infty</math> is analogous to a real [[quadratic field]] and one which is non-split at <math>\\infty</math> is analogous to an imaginary quadratic field. The analogy comes from a quadratic field having real embeddings when the minimal polynomial for a  generator splits over the reals and having non-real embeddings otherwise.  One illustration of the strength of this analogy concerns [[unit group]]s in an order of a rational quaternion algebra:\nit is infinite if the quaternion algebra splits at <math>\\infty</math>{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} and it is finite otherwise{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}, just as the unit group of an order in a quadratic ring is infinite in the real quadratic case and finite otherwise.\n\nThe number of places where a quaternion algebra over the rationals ramifies is always even, and this is equivalent to the [[quadratic reciprocity law]] over the rationals.\nMoreover, the places where ''B'' ramifies determines ''B'' up to isomorphism as an algebra.  (In other words, non-isomorphic quaternion algebras over the rationals do not share the same set of ramified places.) The product of the primes at which ''B'' ramifies is called the '''discriminant''' of ''B''.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Composition algebra]]\n*[[Cyclic algebra]]\n*[[Octonion algebra]]\n*[[Hurwitz quaternion order]]\n*[[Hurwitz quaternion]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | last1=Gille | first1=Philippe | last2=Szamuely | first2=Tam\u00e1s | title=Central simple algebras and Galois cohomology | series=Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematics | volume=101 | location=Cambridge | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=2006 | isbn=0-521-86103-9 | zbl=1137.12001 | doi=10.1017/CBO9780511607219}}\n* {{cite book | first=Tsit-Yuen | last=Lam | authorlink=Tsit Yuen Lam | title=Introduction to Quadratic Forms over Fields | volume=67 | series=[[Graduate Studies in Mathematics]] | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | year=2005 | isbn=0-8218-1095-2 | zbl=1068.11023 | mr = 2104929 }}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{wikibooks|Associative Composition Algebra|Quaternions|Quaternion algebras over R and C}}\n* {{cite book | last1=Knus | first1=Max-Albert | last2=Merkurjev | first2=Alexander | author2-link=Alexander Merkurjev | last3=Rost | first3=Markus | author3-link=Markus Rost | last4=Tignol | first4=Jean-Pierre | title=The book of involutions | others=With a preface by J.

He failed to make an appearance for Spurs and after loan spells at [[Dulwich Hamlet F.C.|Dulwich Hamlet]] and Swedish club [[IFK H\u00e4ssleholm]] he joined [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]. After QPR were relegated at the end of the 2000\u201301 season, [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] acquired him in a transfer deal worth \u00a31.5&nbsp;million. He had a strong first season at [[Fratton Park]], and after scoring 19 goals for the club, he joined [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in March 2002 for \u00a35&nbsp;million. He had a relatively poor spell at Villa, however, and was loaned out to [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in 2003 before making a move to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], where he regained his form, which would ultimately prompt his joining [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in July 2005. At Liverpool he enjoyed considerable success, winning the [[FA Cup]] and [[FA Community Shield]] in 2006, and also gaining a runners-up medal in the [[2007 UEFA Champions League Final]].\n\nAfter scoring 42 goals in three seasons at [[Anfield]], [[Portsmouth F.C|Portsmouth]] re-acquired Crouch for \u00a311&nbsp;million, where he forged an effective partnership with fellow England international [[Jermain Defoe]]. He spent just one season in his second spell at Portsmouth and left for Tottenham Hotspur, where he again linked up with Defoe and [[Harry Redknapp]]. He scored a vital goal for Tottenham against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] which earned the club a place in the [[UEFA Champions League]]. He scored seven goals in ten European matches for Spurs in 2010\u201311, but was unable to replicate this form in the Premier League. He joined [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in August 2011, for a club record fee of \u00a310&nbsp;million. In his first season with Stoke, he scored 14 goals and won the club's [[Stoke City F.C.

He scored eight in [[2012\u201313 Stoke City F.C. season|2012\u201313]] and ten in both the [[2013\u201314 Stoke City F.C. season|2013\u201314]] and [[2014\u201315 Stoke City F.C. season|2014\u201315 seasons]].

He failed to make an appearance for Spurs and after loan spells at [[Dulwich Hamlet F.C.|Dulwich Hamlet]] and Swedish club [[IFK H\u00e4ssleholm]] he joined [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]. After QPR were relegated at the end of the 2000\u201301 season, [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] acquired him in a transfer deal worth \u00a31.5&nbsp;million. He had a strong first season at [[Fratton Park]], and after scoring 19 goals for the club, he joined [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in March 2002 for \u00a35&nbsp;million. He had a relatively poor spell at Villa, however, and was loaned out to [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in 2003 before making a move to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], where he regained his form, which would ultimately prompt his joining [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in July 2005. At Liverpool he enjoyed considerable success, winning the [[FA Cup]] and [[FA Community Shield]] in 2006, and also gaining a runners-up medal in the [[2007 UEFA Champions League Final]].\n\nAfter scoring 42 goals in three seasons at [[Anfield]], [[Portsmouth F.C|Portsmouth]] re-acquired Crouch for \u00a311&nbsp;million, where he forged an effective partnership with fellow England international [[Jermain Defoe]]. He spent just one season in his second spell at Portsmouth and left for Tottenham Hotspur, where he again linked up with Defoe and [[Harry Redknapp]]. He scored a vital goal for Tottenham against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] which earned the club a place in the [[UEFA Champions League]]. He scored seven goals in ten European matches for Spurs in 2010\u201311, but was unable to replicate this form in the Premier League. He joined [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in August 2011, for a club record fee of \u00a310&nbsp;million. In his first season with Stoke, he scored 14 goals and won the club's [[Stoke City F.C.

He scored eight in [[2012\u201313 Stoke City F.C. season|2012\u201313]] and ten in both the [[2013\u201314 Stoke City F.C. season|2013\u201314]] and [[2014\u201315 Stoke City F.C. season|2014\u201315 seasons]].

It is usually translated as a '''commandery'''.\n\nCountries around China have adopted administrative divisions based on or named after the ''j\u00f9n''. See [[\u90e1 (disambiguation)|\u90e1]]<!--intentional link to DAB page--> for further information.\n\n==History and development==\n[[File:Qin Dynasty.png|thumb|Commanderies of Qin Dynasty.]]\n\n===China===\n\n====Eastern Zhou====\nDuring the [[Eastern Zhou]]'s [[Spring and Autumn period]] from the 8th to 5th centuries BCE, the larger and more powerful of the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]]'s [[Chinese feudalism|vassal states]]&mdash;including [[Qin (state)|Qin]], [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]] and [[Wei (state)|Wei]]&mdash;began annexing their smaller rivals. These new lands were not part of their original [[fief]]s and were instead organized into [[Counties of the People's Republic of China#History|counties]] (''xi\u00e0n''<!--Hanzi available by link-->).<ref>{{cite book|last1=L\u00fc|first1=Simian|authorlink1=L\u00fc Simian|title=History of the Three Kingdoms (\u4e09\u56fd\u53f2\u8bdd)|date=2009|publisher=Zhonghua Publishing House (\u4e2d\u534e\u4e66\u5c40)|location=China|isbn=9787101066890|language=Chinese|chapter=Geography of the Later Han (\u540e\u6c49\u7684\u5730\u7406)}}</ref> Eventually, jun were developed as [[marchland]]s between the [[Warring States|major realms]]. Despite having smaller populations and ranking lower on the official hierarchies, the jun were larger and boasted greater military strength than the counties.\n\nAs each state's territory gradually took shape in the 5th- to 3rd-century BCE [[Warring States period]], the jun at the borders flourished. This gave rise to a two-tier administrative system with counties subordinate to jun. Each of the states' territories was by now comparatively larger, hence there was no need for the military might of a jun in the inner regions where counties were established. The border jun's military and strategic significance became more important than those of counties.<ref>''Shi Ji'' vol. 71.</ref>\n\n====Qin dynasty====\nFollowing the unification of China in 221 BCE under the [[Qin Empire]], the Qin government still had to engage in military activity because there were rebels from among the six former states who were unwilling to submit to Qin rule. As a result, the [[Shi Huangdi|First Emperor]] set up 36 jun in the Qin Empire, each subdivided into counties. This established the first two-tier administrative system known to exist in China.\n\n====Han dynasty and Three Kingdoms period====\n[[File:Han_foreign_relations_CE_2_chinese.jpg|thumb|Commanderies (yellow), vassal states (green) and protectorates (orange) in 2 CE.]]\nWhen the [[Han dynasty]] [[Chu-Han contention|triumphed over Chu]] in 206 BCE, the [[Chinese feudalism|Zhou feudal system]] was initially reinstated, with [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Emperor Gao]] recognizing nearly independent [[wang (Chinese title)|kings]] and granting large territories to his relatives. These two sets of kingdoms were placed under hereditary rulers assisted by a [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] (''xi\u00e0ng''<!--Hanzi available by link-->). Parallel to these, some Qin jun were continued, placed under a governor appointed directly by the central government.\n\nBy the Eastern Han dynasty, the jun were [[history of the administrative divisions of China|subordinated to a new division]], the province (''[[zhou (country subdivision)|zh\u014du]]'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/html/1885/42048/northern_front.html|title=The government and geography of the northern frontier of Late Han|last=de Crespigny|first=Rafe|date=2004|website=The government and geography of the northern frontier of Late Han|publisher=Australian National University|access-date=18 February 2016}}</ref> &mdash; establishing a three-tier system composed of provinces (zhou), commanderies (jun), and counties (xian). Based upon [[Chinese legend|legendary accounts]] of the [[Yellow Emperor]]'s [[Nine Provinces (China)|Nine Provinces]] which were geographic rather than formal political areas, there were initially 13 ''zh\u014du'' and roughly 100 jun.\n\n====Jin dynasty and the Southern and Northern Dynasties====\nChina was greatly divided during the following five centuries, during the [[Jin Dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin]] and [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] period. The number of administrative units drastically increased due to intense warfare, fluid political boundaries, forced migrations, widespread population loss, and the loss of central government control in many areas particularly during the [[Sixteen Kingdoms]]. Although the legacy three-tier system was still in formal effect, rulers of various kingdoms had defined and re-defined provinces until they became increasingly sub-divided, blurring the distinction between provinces (zhou) and commanderies (jun) and reflecting the chaos of China at the time.\n\n====Sui and Tang dynasties====\nChina was finally re-united by [[Emperor Wen of Sui|Emperor Wen]] of the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] (581\u2013618) in 589. As there were already over 100 provinces, the province and commandery levels of the administration were merged into one level, typically rendered in English as prefecture, marking the end of the commandery.

See [[\u90e1 (disambiguation)|\u90e1]]<!--intentional link to DAB page--> for further information.\n\n==History and development==\n[[File:Qin Dynasty.png|thumb|Commanderies of Qin Dynasty.]]\n\n===China===\n\n====Eastern Zhou====\nDuring the [[Eastern Zhou]]'s [[Spring and Autumn period]] from the 8th to 5th centuries BCE, the larger and more powerful of the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]]'s [[Chinese feudalism|vassal states]]&mdash;including [[Qin (state)|Qin]], [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]] and [[Wei (state)|Wei]]&mdash;began annexing their smaller rivals. These new lands were not part of their original [[fief]]s and were instead organized into [[Counties of the People's Republic of China#History|counties]] (''xi\u00e0n''<!--Hanzi available by link-->).<ref>{{cite book|last1=L\u00fc|first1=Simian|authorlink1=L\u00fc Simian|title=History of the Three Kingdoms (\u4e09\u56fd\u53f2\u8bdd)|date=2009|publisher=Zhonghua Publishing House (\u4e2d\u534e\u4e66\u5c40)|location=China|isbn=9787101066890|language=Chinese|chapter=Geography of the Later Han (\u540e\u6c49\u7684\u5730\u7406)}}</ref> Eventually, jun were developed as [[marchland]]s between the [[Warring States|major realms]]. Despite having smaller populations and ranking lower on the official hierarchies, the jun were larger and boasted greater military strength than the counties.\n\nAs each state's territory gradually took shape in the 5th- to 3rd-century BCE [[Warring States period]], the jun at the borders flourished. This gave rise to a two-tier administrative system with counties subordinate to jun. Each of the states' territories was by now comparatively larger, hence there was no need for the military might of a jun in the inner regions where counties were established. The border jun's military and strategic significance became more important than those of counties.<ref>''Shi Ji'' vol. 71.</ref>\n\n====Qin dynasty====\nFollowing the unification of China in 221 BCE under the [[Qin Empire]], the Qin government still had to engage in military activity because there were rebels from among the six former states who were unwilling to submit to Qin rule. As a result, the [[Shi Huangdi|First Emperor]] set up 36 jun in the Qin Empire, each subdivided into counties. This established the first two-tier administrative system known to exist in China.\n\n====Han dynasty and Three Kingdoms period====\n[[File:Han_foreign_relations_CE_2_chinese.jpg|thumb|Commanderies (yellow), vassal states (green) and protectorates (orange) in 2 CE.]]\nWhen the [[Han dynasty]] [[Chu-Han contention|triumphed over Chu]] in 206 BCE, the [[Chinese feudalism|Zhou feudal system]] was initially reinstated, with [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Emperor Gao]] recognizing nearly independent [[wang (Chinese title)|kings]] and granting large territories to his relatives. These two sets of kingdoms were placed under hereditary rulers assisted by a [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] (''xi\u00e0ng''<!--Hanzi available by link-->). Parallel to these, some Qin jun were continued, placed under a governor appointed directly by the central government.\n\nBy the Eastern Han dynasty, the jun were [[history of the administrative divisions of China|subordinated to a new division]], the province (''[[zhou (country subdivision)|zh\u014du]]'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/html/1885/42048/northern_front.html|title=The government and geography of the northern frontier of Late Han|last=de Crespigny|first=Rafe|date=2004|website=The government and geography of the northern frontier of Late Han|publisher=Australian National University|access-date=18 February 2016}}</ref> &mdash; establishing a three-tier system composed of provinces (zhou), commanderies (jun), and counties (xian). Based upon [[Chinese legend|legendary accounts]] of the [[Yellow Emperor]]'s [[Nine Provinces (China)|Nine Provinces]] which were geographic rather than formal political areas, there were initially 13 ''zh\u014du'' and roughly 100 jun.\n\n====Jin dynasty and the Southern and Northern Dynasties====\nChina was greatly divided during the following five centuries, during the [[Jin Dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin]] and [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] period. The number of administrative units drastically increased due to intense warfare, fluid political boundaries, forced migrations, widespread population loss, and the loss of central government control in many areas particularly during the [[Sixteen Kingdoms]]. Although the legacy three-tier system was still in formal effect, rulers of various kingdoms had defined and re-defined provinces until they became increasingly sub-divided, blurring the distinction between provinces (zhou) and commanderies (jun) and reflecting the chaos of China at the time.\n\n====Sui and Tang dynasties====\nChina was finally re-united by [[Emperor Wen of Sui|Emperor Wen]] of the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] (581\u2013618) in 589. As there were already over 100 provinces, the province and commandery levels of the administration were merged into one level, typically rendered in English as prefecture, marking the end of the commandery. Some Emperors preferred \"jun\" to refer to this level of administration, but most used \"zhou\" and the political function was the same, regardless. By the end of the Tang Dynasty the term jun saw no more use in China (and a new higher tier of administrative unit, the circuit (dao) had been introduced, bringing back a three-tier system).\n\n===Taiwan (1920\u20131945)===\n{{Main|Political divisions of Taiwan (1895\u20131945)#Sh\u016b and Ch\u014d (1920\u20131945)}}\nDuring 1920\u20131945, when Taiwan was [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|under Japanese rule]], there were divisions called \u90e1 ([[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]: j\u00f9n, [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: gun).

Since ancient times, Chengdu has been known as \"the Abundant Land\" owing to its fertile soil, favorable climate, and novel Dujiangyan Irrigation System.\n\nChengdu is located at the western edge of the [[Sichuan Basin]] and sits on the [[Chengdu Plain]]; the dominating terrain is plains. The [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#Prefecture level|prefecture]] ranges in latitude from 30\u00b0 05' to 31\u00b0 26' N, while its longitude ranges from 102\u00b0 54' to 104\u00b0 53' E, stretching for {{convert|192|km}} from east to west and {{convert|166|km|abbr=on}} south to north, administering {{convert|12390|km2}} of land. Neighbouring prefectures are [[Deyang]] (NE), [[Ziyang, Sichuan|Ziyang]] (SE), [[Meishan]] (S), [[Ya'an]] (SW), and the [[Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture]] (N). The urban area, with an elevation of {{convert|500|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}, features a few rivers, three of them being the [[Jin River (Sichuan)|Jin]], [[Fu River (Sichuan)|Fu]], and [[Sha River]]s. Outside of the immediate urban area, the topography becomes more complex: to the east lies the [[Longquan Mountains]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u9f99\u6cc9\u5c71\u8109}}) and the Penzhong Hills ({{lang|zh|\u76c6\u4e2d\u4e18\u9675}}); to the west lie the [[Qionglai Mountains]], which rise to {{convert|5364|m|abbr=on}} in Dayi County. The lowest point in Chengdu Prefecture, at {{convert|378|m|abbr=on}}, lies in the southeast in Jintang County.\n\n===Climate===\nChengdu has a [[monsoon]]-influenced [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Cwa'') and is largely warm with high [[relative humidity]] all year. It has four distinct seasons, with moderate rainfall concentrated mainly in the warmer months, and relieved from both sweltering summers and freezing winters. The [[Qin Mountains]] (Qinling) to the far north help shield the city from cold [[Siberian anticyclone|Siberian winds]] in the winter; because of this, the short winter is milder than in the Lower [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]]. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in January is {{convert|5.6|\u00b0C|1}}, and snow is rare but there are a few periods of frost each winter. The summer is hot and humid, but not to the extent of the \"[[Three Furnaces]]\" cities of [[Chongqing]], [[Wuhan]], and [[Nanjing]], all which lie in the Yangtze basin.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.gzkp.org.cn/show.aspx?id=180&cid=5 |script-title = zh:\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u91cd\u5e86\u3001\u6b66\u6c49\u3001\u5357\u4eac\u6709\"\u4e09\u5927\u706b\u7089\"\u4e4b\u79f0\uff1f |publisher = Guangzhou Popular Science News Net ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5e7f\u5dde\u79d1\u666e\u8d44\u8baf\u7f51}}) |language = zh-cn |date = 12 September 2007 |accessdate = 29 November 2010 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141112042247/http://www.gzkp.org.cn/show.aspx?id=180&cid=5 |archivedate = 12 November 2014 |df = dmy-all\n}}</ref> The 24-hour daily mean temperature in July and August is around {{convert|25|\u00b0C}}, with afternoon highs sometimes reaching {{convert|33|\u00b0C}}; sustained heat as found in much of eastern China is rare. Rainfall is common year-round but is the greatest in July and August, with very little of it in the cooler months. Chengdu also has one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, with less sunshine annually than much of Northern Europe, and most days are overcast even if without rain. This is especially so in the winter months, when it is nearly continuously grey, compounded by the poor air quality. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 16 percent in December to 38 percent in August, the city receives 1,073 hours of bright sunshine annually. Spring (March\u2013April) tends to be sunnier and warmer in the day than autumn (October\u2013November). The annual mean is {{convert|16.27|\u00b0C|1}}, and extremes have ranged from {{convert|\u22124.6|\u00b0C|0}} to {{convert|37.5|\u00b0C}}.\n\n{{Weather box\n|metric first=y\n|single line=y \n|collapsed = Y\n|location = Chengdu (Shuangliu District, 1981\u20132010 normals)\n|Jan high C =  9.4\n|Feb high C = 11.8\n|Mar high C = 16.3\n|Apr high C = 21.9\n|May high C = 26.6\n|Jun high C = 28.1\n|Jul high C = 29.8\n|Aug high C = 29.6\n|Sep high C = 25.8\n|Oct high C = 20.9\n|Nov high C = 16.3\n|Dec high C = 10.7\n\n|Jan mean C =  5.6\n|Feb mean C =  7.9\n|Mar mean C = 11.5\n|Apr mean C = 16.6\n|May mean C = 21.3\n|Jun mean C = 23.8\n|Jul mean C = 25.4\n|Aug mean C = 24.9\n|Sep mean C = 21.6\n|Oct mean C = 17.2\n|Nov mean C = 12.4\n|Dec mean C =  7.1\n\n|Jan low C =  2.9\n|Feb low C =  5.1\n|Mar low C =  8.1\n|Apr low C = 12.7\n|May low C = 17.3\n|Jun low C = 20.6\n|Jul low C = 22.2\n|Aug low C = 21.7\n|Sep low C = 18.9\n|Oct low C = 14.8\n|Nov low C =  9.8\n|Dec low C =  4.5\n|Jan record high C = 18.9 |Jan record low C = \u22124.6\n|Feb record high C = 24.0 |Feb record low C = \u22122.6\n|Mar record high C = 31.8 |Mar record low C = \u22121.8\n|Apr record high C = 32.5 |Apr record low C =  4.0\n|May record high C = 35.2 |May record low C =  6.3\n|Jun record high C = 37.5 |Jun record low C = 14.2\n|Jul record high C = 37.3 |Jul record low C = 16.6\n|Aug record high C = 36.6 |Aug record low C = 16.0\n|Sep record high C = 36.2 |Sep record low C = 12.2\n|Oct record high C = 30.1 |Oct record low C =  3.1\n|Nov record high C = 26.2 |Nov record low C =  0.2\n|Dec record high C = 18.4 |Dec record low C = \u22124.1\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm =   8.9\n|Feb precipitation mm =  12.9\n|Mar precipitation mm =  22.4\n|Apr precipitation mm =  47.6\n|May precipitation mm =  76.9\n|Jun precipitation mm = 114.3\n|Jul precipitation mm = 208.1\n|Aug precipitation mm = 197.2\n|Sep precipitation mm = 111.0\n|Oct precipitation mm =  35.5\n|Nov precipitation mm =  14.8\n|Dec precipitation mm =   6.1\n|Jan humidity = 85\n|Feb humidity = 83\n|Mar humidity = 81\n|Apr humidity = 80\n|May humidity = 77\n|Jun humidity = 82\n|Jul humidity = 86\n|Aug humidity = 86\n|Sep humidity = 85\n|Oct humidity = 85\n|Nov humidity = 84\n|Dec humidity = 85\n|unit precipitation days = 0.1 mm\n|Jan precipitation days =  7.0\n|Feb precipitation days =  8.5\n|Mar precipitation days = 10.9\n|Apr precipitation days = 13.0\n|May precipitation days = 14.7\n|Jun precipitation days = 15.2\n|Jul precipitation days = 17.6\n|Aug precipitation days = 15.8\n|Sep precipitation days = 15.6\n|Oct precipitation days = 13.1\n|Nov precipitation days =  7.7\n|Dec precipitation days =  5.2\n|Jan sun =  53.3 |Jan percentsun = 17\n|Feb sun =  51.4 |Feb percentsun = 17\n|Mar sun =  83.1 |Mar percentsun = 23\n|Apr sun = 113.9 |Apr percentsun = 30\n|May sun = 121.7 |May percentsun = 29\n|Jun sun = 117.2 |Jun percentsun = 28\n|Jul sun = 131.9 |Jul percentsun = 31\n|Aug sun = 155.0 |Aug percentsun = 38\n|Sep sun =  77.6 |Sep percentsun = 21\n|Oct sun =  59.4 |Oct percentsun = 17\n|Nov sun =  57.2 |Nov percentsun = 18\n|Dec sun =  51.6 |Dec percentsun = 16\n                 |year percentsun= 24\n|source 1 = China Meteorological Administration (precipitation days and sunshine 1971&ndash;2000)<ref name=\"cma graphical\">{{cite web|url=http://data.cma.cn/data/weatherBk.html |script-title=zh:\u4e2d\u56fd\u6c14\u8c61\u6570\u636e\u7f51 -

The city has been home to literary giants, such as [[Sima Xiangru]] and [[Yang Xiong (author)|Yang Xiong]], two masters of [[Fu (poetry)|Fu]], a mixture of descriptive prose and verse during the Han dynasty; [[Li Bai]] and [[Su Shi]], the most eminent poets of the Tang and Song dynasties respectively; [[Yang Shen'an]], a famous scholar of the Ming dynasty; and [[Guo Moruo]] and [[Ba Jin]], two well-known modern writers. [[Chang Qu]], a historian of Chengdu during the Jin dynasty, compiled the earliest local historical records, the [[Record of Hua Yang State]]. [[Zhao Chongzuo]], a poet in Chengdu during the Later Shu Kingdom, edited [[Among the Flowers]], the first anthology of [[Ci (poetry)|Ci]] in China's history. [[Meng Chang]], the king of Later Shu, wrote the first couplet for the Spring Festival, which says, \"A harvest year accepts celebrations, good festivals foreshadow long springs.\"\n\n===Fine art===\nDuring the period of the Five Dynasties, Huang Quan, a painter in Chengdu, initiated the [[Fine-Brush Flower-and-Bird Painting school]] with other painters.

In February 1891, Dr. Virgil Hart, who had been Superintendent of the New York Methodist Mission Society of Central China recommended that Chengtu be its first Mission sight. During the meeting, it was proposed he lead this contingency; having built western hospitals, Boy's and Girl's schools at Missions he established on the Yangtze and Gan Rivers from 1866 \u2013 1888. On 9 May 1891 Dr. Virgil Hart arrived in Chengtu and two weeks later bought a home and had it subdivided into living quarters and a dispensary, for the later arriving Missionary staff to move into.\n\nOn 24 June 1892, the doors of Chengtu's first Protestant Mission Headquarters were opened with over one thousand people of the community attending. The first Methodist religious service was held the following Sunday with only several attendants. The first western dispensary in Sichuan was opened 3 November 1892 with sixteen patients seeking care. The mission site became so popular that a larger space was secured near Chengtu's East Gate in the spring of 1893. This site is where the city's first Methodist church and hospital were built. These were later raized by rioting Chinese in 1895 and the Mission staff retreated to Chongqing and later Shanghai to escape the marauders. Dr. Virgil Hart traveled to Peking to demand redress and full payment of retribution was collected from Sichuan Viceroy Liu Ping Chang. The mission compound was quickly rebuilt only to be destroyed once more in the riots of 1901. These were rebuilt a third time and later missionaries would relocate and expand the Boys' and Girls' Schools just south of the city, dedicating the Divinity College as Hart College in 1914; a part of the West China Union University, that is now Sichuan University and the West China School of Medicine (Huaxiyida).<ref>\"Man on a Mission\" by Stanley Crawford</ref>\n\nThe Methodist Church near the East Gate would be closed by the CCP and became a grain storage facility. It was reopened as a Methodist church in the mid-1980s.\n\nIn December 2018 the authorities attempted to close a 500-member underground church: \"The Early Rain Covenant Church\", led by [[Wang Yi (pastor)|Pastor Wang Yi]]. Over 100 members of the church were arrested including the pastor and his wife. The church's kindergarten and theological college were raided and the church's media outlets were closed down. Before his arrest, church member Li Yingqiang declared: \"Even if we are down to our last five, worship and gatherings will still go on because our faith is real. [\u2026] Persecution is a price worth paying for the Lord\". Police are said to have told one member that the church had been declared an illegal organisation. Chinese media were banned from reporting the events. Video footage which found its way onto western social media showed arrests and photographs alleged to be of injuries inflicted by the police.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/2177897/chinese-pastor-wang-yis-wife-accused-inciting-subversion-and |title=Chinese pastor's wife accused of subversion, held in unknown location |access-date=14 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215213043/https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/2177897/chinese-pastor-wang-yis-wife-accused-inciting-subversion-and |archive-date=15 December 2018 |url-status=live|date=13 December 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"scmp.com\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/2177520/underground-chinese-church-members-vow-defy-crackdown-and-keep |title=Members of unofficial Chinese church vow to keep meeting |access-date=14 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181213082423/https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/2177520/underground-chinese-church-members-vow-defy-crackdown-and-keep |archive-date=13 December 2018 |url-status=live|date=11 December 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"scmp.com\"/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2018/12/minitrue-no-reports-on-chengdu-house-church-crackdown/ |title=Minitrue: No Reports on Chengdu Church Crackdown \u2013 China Digital Times (CDT) |access-date=14 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181214164908/https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2018/12/minitrue-no-reports-on-chengdu-house-church-crackdown/ |archive-date=14 December 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> From a photo of {{M|s|link=y}}.

On sunny days, local people like to play Mahjong on the sidewalks to enjoy the sunshine and also the time with friends. Almost every person aims to play Mahjong with money.\n\nMahjong is the most popular entertainment choice among locals for several reasons. Chengdu locals have simplified the rules and made it easier to play as compared to, Cantonese Mahjong. Also, Mahjong in Chengdu is a way to meet old friends and to strengthen family relationships.

The western mountainous area is also home to a large primitive forest with abundant biological resources and a [[giant panda]] habitat. East of Chengdu stands the low [[Longquan Mountains]] and the west bordering area of the hilly land of middle reaches of [[Min River (Sichuan)|Min River]], an area noted by several converging rivers. Since ancient times, Chengdu has been known as \"the Abundant Land\" owing to its fertile soil, favorable climate, and novel Dujiangyan Irrigation System.\n\nChengdu is located at the western edge of the [[Sichuan Basin]] and sits on the [[Chengdu Plain]]; the dominating terrain is plains. The [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#Prefecture level|prefecture]] ranges in latitude from 30\u00b0 05' to 31\u00b0 26' N, while its longitude ranges from 102\u00b0 54' to 104\u00b0 53' E, stretching for {{convert|192|km}} from east to west and {{convert|166|km|abbr=on}} south to north, administering {{convert|12390|km2}} of land. Neighbouring prefectures are [[Deyang]] (NE), [[Ziyang, Sichuan|Ziyang]] (SE), [[Meishan]] (S), [[Ya'an]] (SW), and the [[Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture]] (N). The urban area, with an elevation of {{convert|500|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}, features a few rivers, three of them being the [[Jin River (Sichuan)|Jin]], [[Fu River (Sichuan)|Fu]], and [[Sha River]]s. Outside of the immediate urban area, the topography becomes more complex: to the east lies the [[Longquan Mountains]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u9f99\u6cc9\u5c71\u8109}}) and the Penzhong Hills ({{lang|zh|\u76c6\u4e2d\u4e18\u9675}}); to the west lie the [[Qionglai Mountains]], which rise to {{convert|5364|m|abbr=on}} in Dayi County. The lowest point in Chengdu Prefecture, at {{convert|378|m|abbr=on}}, lies in the southeast in Jintang County.\n\n===Climate===\nChengdu has a [[monsoon]]-influenced [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Cwa'') and is largely warm with high [[relative humidity]] all year. It has four distinct seasons, with moderate rainfall concentrated mainly in the warmer months, and relieved from both sweltering summers and freezing winters. The [[Qin Mountains]] (Qinling) to the far north help shield the city from cold [[Siberian anticyclone|Siberian winds]] in the winter; because of this, the short winter is milder than in the Lower [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]]. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in January is {{convert|5.6|\u00b0C|1}}, and snow is rare but there are a few periods of frost each winter.

Rainfall is common year-round but is the greatest in July and August, with very little of it in the cooler months. Chengdu also has one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, with less sunshine annually than much of Northern Europe, and most days are overcast even if without rain. This is especially so in the winter months, when it is nearly continuously grey, compounded by the poor air quality.

The city has been home to literary giants, such as [[Sima Xiangru]] and [[Yang Xiong (author)|Yang Xiong]], two masters of [[Fu (poetry)|Fu]], a mixture of descriptive prose and verse during the Han dynasty; [[Li Bai]] and [[Su Shi]], the most eminent poets of the Tang and Song dynasties respectively; [[Yang Shen'an]], a famous scholar of the Ming dynasty; and [[Guo Moruo]] and [[Ba Jin]], two well-known modern writers. [[Chang Qu]], a historian of Chengdu during the Jin dynasty, compiled the earliest local historical records, the [[Record of Hua Yang State]]. [[Zhao Chongzuo]], a poet in Chengdu during the Later Shu Kingdom, edited [[Among the Flowers]], the first anthology of [[Ci (poetry)|Ci]] in China's history. [[Meng Chang]], the king of Later Shu, wrote the first couplet for the Spring Festival, which says, \"A harvest year accepts celebrations, good festivals foreshadow long springs.\"\n\n===Fine art===\nDuring the period of the Five Dynasties, Huang Quan, a painter in Chengdu, initiated the [[Fine-Brush Flower-and-Bird Painting school]] with other painters.

In February 1891, Dr. Virgil Hart, who had been Superintendent of the New York Methodist Mission Society of Central China recommended that Chengtu be its first Mission sight. During the meeting, it was proposed he lead this contingency; having built western hospitals, Boy's and Girl's schools at Missions he established on the Yangtze and Gan Rivers from 1866 \u2013 1888. On 9 May 1891 Dr. Virgil Hart arrived in Chengtu and two weeks later bought a home and had it subdivided into living quarters and a dispensary, for the later arriving Missionary staff to move into.\n\nOn 24 June 1892, the doors of Chengtu's first Protestant Mission Headquarters were opened with over one thousand people of the community attending. The first Methodist religious service was held the following Sunday with only several attendants. The first western dispensary in Sichuan was opened 3 November 1892 with sixteen patients seeking care. The mission site became so popular that a larger space was secured near Chengtu's East Gate in the spring of 1893. This site is where the city's first Methodist church and hospital were built. These were later raized by rioting Chinese in 1895 and the Mission staff retreated to Chongqing and later Shanghai to escape the marauders. Dr. Virgil Hart traveled to Peking to demand redress and full payment of retribution was collected from Sichuan Viceroy Liu Ping Chang. The mission compound was quickly rebuilt only to be destroyed once more in the riots of 1901. These were rebuilt a third time and later missionaries would relocate and expand the Boys' and Girls' Schools just south of the city, dedicating the Divinity College as Hart College in 1914; a part of the West China Union University, that is now Sichuan University and the West China School of Medicine (Huaxiyida).<ref>\"Man on a Mission\" by Stanley Crawford</ref>\n\nThe Methodist Church near the East Gate would be closed by the CCP and became a grain storage facility. It was reopened as a Methodist church in the mid-1980s.\n\nIn December 2018 the authorities attempted to close a 500-member underground church: \"The Early Rain Covenant Church\", led by [[Wang Yi (pastor)|Pastor Wang Yi]]. Over 100 members of the church were arrested including the pastor and his wife. The church's kindergarten and theological college were raided and the church's media outlets were closed down. Before his arrest, church member Li Yingqiang declared: \"Even if we are down to our last five, worship and gatherings will still go on because our faith is real. [\u2026] Persecution is a price worth paying for the Lord\". Police are said to have told one member that the church had been declared an illegal organisation. Chinese media were banned from reporting the events. Video footage which found its way onto western social media showed arrests and photographs alleged to be of injuries inflicted by the police.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/2177897/chinese-pastor-wang-yis-wife-accused-inciting-subversion-and |title=Chinese pastor's wife accused of subversion, held in unknown location |access-date=14 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215213043/https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/2177897/chinese-pastor-wang-yis-wife-accused-inciting-subversion-and |archive-date=15 December 2018 |url-status=live|date=13 December 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"scmp.com\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/2177520/underground-chinese-church-members-vow-defy-crackdown-and-keep |title=Members of unofficial Chinese church vow to keep meeting |access-date=14 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181213082423/https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/2177520/underground-chinese-church-members-vow-defy-crackdown-and-keep |archive-date=13 December 2018 |url-status=live|date=11 December 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"scmp.com\"/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2018/12/minitrue-no-reports-on-chengdu-house-church-crackdown/ |title=Minitrue: No Reports on Chengdu Church Crackdown \u2013 China Digital Times (CDT) |access-date=14 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181214164908/https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2018/12/minitrue-no-reports-on-chengdu-house-church-crackdown/ |archive-date=14 December 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> From a photo of {{M|s|link=y}}.

Almost every person aims to play Mahjong with money.\n\nMahjong is the most popular entertainment choice among locals for several reasons. Chengdu locals have simplified the rules and made it easier to play as compared to, Cantonese Mahjong. Also, Mahjong in Chengdu is a way to meet old friends and to strengthen family relationships.
