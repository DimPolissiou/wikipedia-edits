There are two versions of this story, one published in 1902 and the other in 1908. The story written in 1908 has become an often anthologized classic, while the 1902 story is less well known. The 1908 version is about an unnamed male protagonist who ventures out in the subzero [[boreal forest]] of the [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]]. He is followed by a native dog and is en route to visit his friends\u2014ignoring warnings from an older man [an elder from the Sulphur Creek]<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |date=29 May 1902 Hundesohn|url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> about the dangers of hiking alone in extreme cold. The protagonist underestimates the harsh conditions and slowly begins to freeze to death. After building a fire and leaving it to continue his journey, he later attempts to build another fails, then tries to kill the dog to gain access to its body heat, but fails to do either. He slips into [[unconsciousness]] and dies of [[hypothermia]].\n\nThe 1902 version describes a similar situation with a different plot. Though the structure and story line are similar in both, in 1902 the weather is not as cold and horrendous, no dog follows the protagonist, the fire is not doused, and the man (named Tom Vincent) suffers only from permanent [[frostbite]] and survives to become a more melancholic but wiser person.\n\nThe 1908 \"To Build a Fire\" is an oft-cited example of the [[naturalism (literature)|naturalist movement]] that portrays the conflict of [[Man vs. Nature|man vs. nature]]. It also reflects what London learned in the [[Yukon Territory]].\n\n==1908 version plot==\nAn unnamed man sets out to hike through the forests bordering the [[Yukon River]] on a winter day whose temperature has fallen to \u221275&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u221259&nbsp;\u00b0C). Having ignored warnings against traveling alone in such conditions, he is accompanied only by a large [[husky]] dog. The animal's instincts warn it about the dangers of the extreme cold, but the dog follows the man unwillingly. As they follow the course of a frozen creek, the man is careful to avoid patches of thin ice hidden by the snow that cover pockets of unfrozen water. His goal is to reach a group of prospectors (\"the boys\") at their camp by six o'clock that evening.\n\nAt half past noon, the man stops and builds a fire so he can warm up and eat his lunch. Shortly after resuming his hike, he accidentally breaks through the ice and soaks his feet and lower legs, forcing him to stop and build another fire\u2014this one under a tree\u2014in order to dry himself. As he pulls twigs from the brush pile around the tree to feed the flames, the vibrations eventually cause the snow to tumble down from the branches overhead and extinguish the fire. The man quickly begins to lose sensation in his extremities and hurries to light another fire, now starting to understand the warnings about the life-threatening danger posed by the extreme cold. He lights the fire, igniting all of his matches and burning himself in the process due to the numbness in his hands. While trying to remove a piece of moss from the fire, he inadvertently pokes the burning twigs apart and extinguishes them. With no way to start another fire, the man tries to kill the dog and use its body heat to save himself, but his hands are so stiff that he can neither strangle the animal nor draw his knife to cut its throat. Finally, he tries to restore his circulation by running toward the camp, but stumbles and falls multiple times in the snow. The man dies of [[hypothermia]], imagining himself standing with \"the boys\" as they find his body, and the dog leaves the body after dark to find food and shelter at the camp.\n\n==Character relationships==\nThe protagonist and the old man of Sulphur Creek are seen in the beginning of the story. The old man of Sulphur Creek warns the protagonist about the danger of travelling alone in such cold temperatures, but being ignorant the protagonist scoffs at the advice of the old man. The protagonist is seen reflecting on his advice towards his demise, and realizes that the old man of Sulphur Creek was right in his warning.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe man and the dog's relationship is followed throughout the story. The man has strict control of the dog, as explicitly mentioned by London. The dog is almost like the man's slave.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ulicne|first1=Chris|title=The Unmentioned|url=http://blogs.setonhill.edu/ChristopherUlicne/coursework007137.html|website=Stone Hill College|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref> The dog is shown cowering before the man and following orders. There is no physical intimacy or compassion between the two. The man does not pet the dog or treat it fondly. In fact, the man forces the dog to go ahead of him when he suspects the ice will break. This helps to build the idea that the man believes nature is intended to serve him.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fleissner|first1=Jennifer|title=\"To Build a Fire\": An Environmentalist Interpretation|url=http://americainclass.org/to-build-a-fire-an-environmentalist-interpretation/|website=America In Class|accessdate=5 April 2018|date=January 2013}}</ref> The man's interactions in this relationship is how the reader discovers the man's personality and character. By including the dog, the author makes the man less likable. He was cruel towards the dog by having the dog walk in extreme temperatures. Moreover, in the end, he tried to kill the dog for his own benefit. London even describes the dog as his \"toil-slave\".<ref name=\"story\">{{cite magazine|date=August 1908|title=To Build a Fire|volume=76|last=London|first=Jack|magazine=The Century Magazine |pages=525\u2013534 |url=http://london.sonoma.edu/Writings/LostFace/fire.html |access-date=April 16, 2019 |via=London.Sonoma.edu}} Full text of the famous second version, published for an adult audience.</ref>\n\nWhile the man sees the dog only as his slave on the journey, the dog sees the man as a provider of his needs, which helps follow his [[instincts]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Placing the dog in the story allowed London to show the wisdom of nature over the [[arrogance]] of the man, which eventually leads to his demise. <ref>{{cite magazine |title=\"Never Travel Alone\": Naturalism, Jack London, and the White Silence |author=Jeanne Campbell Reesman |magazine=American Literary Realism, 1870\u20131910 |volume=29 |issue=2 |date=Winter 1997 |pages=33\u201349 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |jstor=27746687 }}</ref> Doing so, allowed London to show that animals survive through instinct.

The protagonist decides to face the brutally cold temperatures of the [[Yukon Territory]], despite being warned by an older man. The short story depicts the protagonist's battle of life and death while highlighting the importance of the fire.\n\nOne theme illustrated in the story is the man's sense of judgment contrasted with the dog's animal [[instinct]]s. Throughout the story, London hints that the dog has more knowledge of survival than the man. The judgment-versus-instinct theme is evident when the man builds the first fire. While the dog wants to stay by the fire to keep warm, the man is determined to keep moving. As the dog reluctantly follows the man across a frozen river, the dog is more cautious than the man.\n\nThe protagonist's desperation is evident throughout the majority of the story. It is noticeable soon after the man falls into a frozen-over river. In order to save himself, he scrambles to build a fire but is too busy worrying about his survival to notice the mistake of building a fire underneath a tree which has collected an enormous amount of snow. After the first fire is put out, his desperation becomes more defined as he seemingly will do anything to survive, including attempting to kill his dog for warmth and using all his matches at once in a final attempt to light his last fire. His desperation for survival and his fear of death cause him to panic, leading to his final demise as he freezes to death at the end of the story.<ref name=\"story\" />\n\n\"[[Perseverance (virtue)|Perseverance]]\" Another evident theme in the story is perseverance. Although the man makes several mistakes and is getting frostbite in his fingers and toes, he continues to fight for survival.

For example, he goes through the extremely cold territory alone, despite going for the first time. He laughs off the crucial advice from the old man of Sulphur Creek about traveling with an acquaintance because he thinks he knows what he's doing. This arrogance results in the protagonist putting himself in a dangerous situation that was preventable. At first, he thinks it's nothing and that everything will be fine. By the end of the story, he dies as a result of his arrogance. Through this story, London shows how the man's demise is due to his humanity and lack of thought when going into this journey. Also, he shows that the dog survives because of following its instincts which is something that the man does not pay attention to.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bowen |first1=James |title='To Build a Fire': Epistemology and the White Wilderness |journal=Western American Literature |date=1971 |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=287\u2013289|doi=10.1353/wal.1971.0004 }}</ref> Another example of arrogance occurs when the protagonist disregards the possibility that there may be situations he cannot overcome. The old man warns the protagonist of this and also seems to have a better understanding of the natural world, respecting the fact that there are some situations the man will be unable to control. Not only does the old man see the protagonist's stupidity, but the dog notices the man's lack of knowledge about the terrain and its obstacles after he fails to keep a fire going.\n\nSuccumbing to death is another theme in the story: more specifically the peace that may be found in death. London foreshadows the death of the man early in the story, so it is not a surprise that the man dies. However, London depicts death quite differently than many other authors do. The man drifts off into a calm, peaceful slumber devoid of suffering and pain. London's use of relaxing words dissuades the reader from feeling a great deal of sympathy for the man, as the death is merciful and graciously anticipated, rather than sad. In contrast to more dramatic depictions of death, London's depiction reveals death as a peaceful escape from tumult and pain.\n\nIndividualism is another common theme London portrays in the story. The man only relies on himself to get him through the Yukon; he doesn't believe that he needs any help. This theme can also be connected to the theme mentioned above of the man's judgment, and the man's arrogance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://commons.lib.jmu.edu/cgi/cview.cgi/jmurj/vol4/iss1/7|title=James Madison University \u2013 Log in |publisher=Berkeley Electronic Press |website=commons.lib.jmu.edu |url-access=registration |access-date=2018-04-10}}</ref>\n\n==1902 version==\nThe earlier version was first published in ''[[The Youth's Companion]]'' on May 29, 1902.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=London |first=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |url=http://london.sonoma.edu/writings/Uncollected/tobuildafire.html |magazine=Youth's Companion |volume=76 |date=May 29, 1902 |access-date=April 16, 2019 |via=London.Sonoma.edu}} Full text of the first, more juvenile version.</ref> Although it differs in some details, the general structure and storyline are similar; the primary differences are as follows: in the first version it is not as cold, there is no dog, the fire is not doused, and the man (named Tom Vincent) suffers some permanent frostbite damage but survives, sad but wiser.\n\n==Films==\n*''[[:fr:Construire un feu (film, 1928)|Construire un feu]]'' (1927\u20131928) is an early short film by [[Claude Autant-Lara]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unifrance.org/film/34430/construire-un-feu |title=Construire un feu |language=fr |website=UNIFRANCE |access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019787/combined |title=Construire un feu (1930) |website=Internet Movie Database}}</ref> \n*''To Build a Fire'' (1969) was made by [[David Cobham]], with [[Ian Hogg (actor)|Ian Hogg]] as the man and [[Orson Welles]] as the narrator.<ref name=\"Yahoo\">{{cite web |url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800395257/info |title=To Build a Fire (1969) |website=Yahoo!

There are two versions of this story, one published in 1902 and the other in 1908. The story written in 1908 has become an often anthologized classic, while the 1902 story is less well known. The 1908 version is about an unnamed male protagonist who ventures out in the subzero [[boreal forest]] of the [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]]. He is followed by a native dog and is en route to visit his friends\u2014ignoring warnings from an older man [an elder from the Sulphur Creek]<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |date=29 May 1902 Hundesohn|url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> about the dangers of hiking alone in extreme cold. The protagonist underestimates the harsh conditions and slowly begins to freeze to death. After building one fire and leaving it to continue his journey, he later attempts to build another fails, then tries to kill the dog to gain access to its body heat, but fails to do either. He slips into [[unconsciousness]] and dies of [[hypothermia]].\n\nThe 1902 version describes a similar situation with a different plot. Though the structure and story line are similar in both, in 1902 the weather is not as cold and horrendous, no dog follows the protagonist, the fire is not doused, and the man (named Tom Vincent) suffers only from permanent [[frostbite]] and survives to become a more melancholic but wiser person.\n\nThe 1908 \"To Build a Fire\" is an oft-cited example of the [[naturalism (literature)|naturalist movement]] that portrays the conflict of [[Man vs. Nature|man vs. nature]]. It also reflects what London learned in the [[Yukon Territory]].\n\n==1908 version plot==\nAn unnamed man sets out to hike through the forests bordering the [[Yukon River]] on a winter day whose temperature has fallen to \u221275&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u221259&nbsp;\u00b0C). Having ignored warnings against traveling alone in such conditions, he is accompanied only by a large [[husky]] dog. The animal's instincts warn it about the dangers of the extreme cold, but the dog follows the man unwillingly. As they follow the course of a frozen creek, the man is careful to avoid patches of thin ice hidden by the snow that cover pockets of unfrozen water. His goal is to reach a group of prospectors (\"the boys\") at their camp by six o'clock that evening.\n\nAt half past noon, the man stops and builds a fire so he can warm up and eat his lunch. Shortly after resuming his hike, he accidentally breaks through the ice and soaks his feet and lower legs, forcing him to stop and build another fire\u2014this one under a tree\u2014in order to dry himself. As he pulls twigs from the brush pile around the tree to feed the flames, the vibrations eventually cause the snow to tumble down from the branches overhead and extinguish the fire. The man quickly begins to lose sensation in his extremities and hurries to light another fire, now starting to understand the warnings about the life-threatening danger posed by the extreme cold. He lights the fire, igniting all of his matches and burning himself in the process due to the numbness in his hands. While trying to remove a piece of moss from the fire, he inadvertently pokes the burning twigs apart and extinguishes them. With no way to start another fire, the man tries to kill the dog and use its body heat to save himself, but his hands are so stiff that he can neither strangle the animal nor draw his knife to cut its throat. Finally, he tries to restore his circulation by running toward the camp, but stumbles and falls multiple times in the snow. The man dies of [[hypothermia]], imagining himself standing with \"the boys\" as they find his body, and the dog leaves the body after dark to find food and shelter at the camp.\n\n==Character relationships==\nThe protagonist and the old man of Sulphur Creek are seen in the beginning of the story. The old man of Sulphur Creek warns the protagonist about the danger of travelling alone in such cold temperatures, but being ignorant the protagonist scoffs at the advice of the old man. The protagonist is seen reflecting on his advice towards his demise, and realizes that the old man of Sulphur Creek was right in his warning.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe man and the dog's relationship is followed throughout the story. The man has strict control of the dog, as explicitly mentioned by London. The dog is almost like the man's slave.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ulicne|first1=Chris|title=The Unmentioned|url=http://blogs.setonhill.edu/ChristopherUlicne/coursework007137.html|website=Stone Hill College|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref> The dog is shown cowering before the man and following orders. There is no physical intimacy or compassion between the two. The man does not pet the dog or treat it fondly. In fact, the man forces the dog to go ahead of him when he suspects the ice will break. This helps to build the idea that the man believes nature is intended to serve him.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fleissner|first1=Jennifer|title=\"To Build a Fire\": An Environmentalist Interpretation|url=http://americainclass.org/to-build-a-fire-an-environmentalist-interpretation/|website=America In Class|accessdate=5 April 2018|date=January 2013}}</ref> The man's interactions in this relationship is how the reader discovers the man's personality and character. By including the dog, the author makes the man less likable. He was cruel towards the dog by having the dog walk in extreme temperatures. Moreover, in the end, he tried to kill the dog for his own benefit. London even describes the dog as his \"toil-slave\".<ref name=\"story\">{{cite magazine|date=August 1908|title=To Build a Fire|volume=76|last=London|first=Jack|magazine=The Century Magazine |pages=525\u2013534 |url=http://london.sonoma.edu/Writings/LostFace/fire.html |access-date=April 16, 2019 |via=London.Sonoma.edu}} Full text of the famous second version, published for an adult audience.</ref>\n\nWhile the man sees the dog only as his slave on the journey, the dog sees the man as a provider of his needs, which helps follow his [[instincts]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Placing the dog in the story allowed London to show the wisdom of nature over the [[arrogance]] of the man, which eventually leads to his demise. <ref>{{cite magazine |title=\"Never Travel Alone\": Naturalism, Jack London, and the White Silence |author=Jeanne Campbell Reesman |magazine=American Literary Realism, 1870\u20131910 |volume=29 |issue=2 |date=Winter 1997 |pages=33\u201349 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |jstor=27746687 }}</ref> Doing so, allowed London to show that animals survive through instinct.

The protagonist decides to face the brutally cold temperatures of the [[Yukon Territory]], despite being warned by an older man. The short story depicts the protagonist's battle of life and death while highlighting the importance of the fire.\n\nOne theme illustrated in the story is the man's sense of judgment contrasted with the dog's animal [[instinct]]s. Throughout the story, London hints that the dog has more knowledge of survival than the man. The judgment-versus-instinct theme is evident when the man builds the first fire. While the dog wants to stay by the fire to keep warm, the man is determined to keep moving. As the dog reluctantly follows the man across a frozen river, the dog is more cautious than the man.\n\nThe protagonist's desperation is evident throughout the majority of the story. It is noticeable soon after the man falls into a frozen-over river. In order to save himself, he scrambles to build a fire but is too busy worrying about his survival to notice the mistake of building a fire underneath a tree which has collected an enormous amount of snow. After the first fire is put out, his desperation becomes more defined as he seemingly will do anything to survive, including attempting to kill his dog for warmth and using all his matches at once in a final attempt to light his last fire. His desperation for survival and his fear of death cause him to panic, leading to his final demise as he freezes to death at the end of the story.<ref name=\"story\" />\n\n\"[[Perseverance (virtue)|Perseverance]]\" Another evident theme in the story is perseverance. Although the man makes several mistakes and is getting frostbite in his fingers and toes, he continues to fight for survival. He ignored all the signs that he would not make it to the village he was headed to. For instance, London described \u201cHe did not bare his fingers more than a minute and was surprised to find that they were numb.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |date=29 May 1902 |url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> In less than 60 seconds his fingers were numb indicating to him that it is too dangerous for him to be outside.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shmoop.com/to-build-a-fire/perseverance-theme.html|title=To Build a Fire Theme of Perseverance|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> \n\n\"[[Wisdom and Experience]]\" Another theme that is present is that of wisdom and experience. London shows us throughout the story that the man lacks the knowledge in order to survive in the Yukon.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Welsh |first1=James |title=Masterplots II: Short Story Series |journal=Revised Edition |date=2004 |volume=1 |pages=1\u20133 |url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.unh-proxy01.newhaven.edu:2048/lrc/detail/detail?vid=6&sid=2ee11b99-9eb2-45d3-9942-5949eaec8c5a%40pdc-v-sessmgr03&bdata=JnNpdGU9bHJjLWxpdmU%3d#AN=103331MSS23119240001174&db=lfh |accessdate=16 April 2019}}</ref> Based on instincts, the dog knew that it was too cold to travel in the snow.

It features vocals from American rapper [[Kanye West]]. The song was written by Estelle, West, [[will.i.am]], [[John Legend]], Josh Lopez, Caleb Speir, and [[Keith Harris (record producer)|Keith Harris]]. It was produced by will.i.am, and uses the beat from the song \"Impatient\" from his own third studio album ''[[Songs About Girls]]'' (2007). \"American Boy\" is a breezy [[disco]]-[[funk]] song that lyrically describes a romance with an American suitor. The song's conception came after Legend, Estelle's mentor, suggested she write a song about meeting an American man.\n\n\"American Boy\" was released by [[Atlantic Records]] as the album's second single on 31 March 2008. The song received positive reviews from [[music critics]], who praised its fresh sound and production. The song reached the top five in many European and Oceanic markets, and peaked at number-one in Belgium and Estelle's native United Kingdom. It also achieved success in the United States, peaking at number nine on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] and becoming Estelle's breakout song in the country. The song earned many nominations, and ultimately won a [[51st Annual Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration|Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]]. The music video, featuring a variety of celebrity guests, earned a [[2008 MTV Video Music Awards|Video Music Award]] nomination for Best UK Video. Estelle and West performed the song at the [[2008 MTV Europe Music Awards]] and [[51st Annual Grammy Awards|2008 Grammy Awards]]. \"American Boy\" was featured in the 2009 film  ''[[Obsessed (2009 film)|Obsessed]]''.\n\n==Background and composition==\n{{Quote box|width=330px|align=left|quote=\"It\u2019s a song as breezy as air, so carefree its gorgeously channeled vocals practically float off from the grounded four-on-the-floor disco beat and Quincy-Jones-producing-Michael-Jackson funk bass.  It\u2019s a pure pop gem with a joyful bounce, verdant in textures (particularly the sunglassed analogue synth stabs), contagiously catchy, danceable and singable, and lyrically devoid of depth or scope, like an aimlessly pleasant walk in the park.\"|source=\u2014 Timothy Gabriele of ''[[PopMatters]]'' commenting about \"American Boy\".<ref name=popmatters/>}}\n\"American Boy\" was written by [[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]], [[will.i.am]], [[John Legend]], [[Kanye West]], Josh Lopez, Caleb Speir and Keith Harris. It was also produced by will.i.am and recorded over the instrumental of his song \"Impatient\", from his third studio album ''[[Songs About Girls]]'' (2007). The credits of Lopez, Speir, and Harris were the result of this sampling.<ref name=about/> In a 2008 interview with Pete Lewis of ''[[Blues & Soul]]'', Estelle explained how the song came to fruition: \"We were just messing about in the studio, joking around. And John (Legend) just said to me 'Why don't you write a song about meeting an American boy?'. So I was like 'Well, that's pretty easy' - because I have a lot of male friends out there in New York.

It features vocals from American rapper [[Kanye West]]. The song was written by Estelle, West, [[will.i.am]], [[John Legend]], Josh Lopez, Caleb Speir, and [[Keith Harris (record producer)|Keith Harris]]. It was produced by will.i.am, and uses the beat from the song \"Impatient\" from his own third studio album ''[[Songs About Girls]]'' (2007). \"American Boy\" is a breezy [[disco]]-[[funk]] song that lyrically describes a romance with an American suitor. The song's conception came after Legend, Estelle's mentor, suggested she write a song about meeting an American man.\n\n\"American Boy\" was released by [[Atlantic Records]] as the album's second single on 31 March 2008. The song received positive reviews from [[music critics]], who praised its fresh sound and production. The song reached the top five in many European and Oceanic markets, and peaked at number-one in Belgium and Estelle's native United Kingdom. It also achieved success in the United States, peaking at number nine on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] and becoming Estelle's breakout song in the country. The song earned many nominations, and ultimately won a [[51st Annual Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration|Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]]. The music video, featuring a variety of celebrity guests, earned a [[2008 MTV Video Music Awards|Video Music Award]] nomination for Best UK Video. Estelle and West performed the song at the [[2008 MTV Europe Music Awards]] and [[51st Annual Grammy Awards|2008 Grammy Awards]]. \"American Boy\" was featured in the 2009 film  ''[[Obsessed (2009 film)|Obsessed]]''.\n\n==Background and composition==\n{{Quote box|width=330px|align=left|quote=\"It\u2019s a song as breezy as air, so carefree its gorgeously channeled vocals practically float off from the grounded four-on-the-floor disco beat and Quincy-Jones-producing-Michael-Jackson funk bass.  It\u2019s a pure pop gem with a joyful bounce, verdant in textures (particularly the sunglassed analogue synth stabs), contagiously catchy, danceable and singable, and lyrically devoid of depth or scope, like an aimlessly pleasant walk in the park.\"|source=\u2014 Timothy Gabriele of ''[[PopMatters]]'' commenting about \"American Boy\".<ref name=popmatters/>}}\n\"American Boy\" was written by [[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]], [[will.i.am]], [[John Legend]], [[Kanye West]], Josh Lopez, Caleb Speir and Keith Harris. It was also produced by will.i.am and recorded over the instrumental of his song \"Impatient\", from his third studio album ''[[Songs About Girls]]'' (2007). The credits of Lopez, Speir, and Harris were the result of this sampling.<ref name=about/> In a 2008 interview with Pete Lewis of ''[[Blues & Soul]]'', Estelle explained how the song came to fruition: \"We were just messing about in the studio, joking around. And John (Legend) just said to me 'Why don't you write a song about meeting an American boy?'. So I was like 'Well, that's pretty easy' - because I have a lot of male friends out there in New York.

She also spoke about West's involvement on the song, commenting \"Kanye basically just brought his own cheeky self to the track, his own sense of humour.

In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], it is also colloquially referred to as ''M\u011bi-Ji\u0101-y\u00edng'' (\u7f8e\u52a0\u71df) &ndash; \u201cAmerica and Canada Camp\u201d &ndash;  a reference to the origin of most participants. The program is held at the Chientan Youth Activity Center<ref>[http://chientan.cyh.org.tw/?lang=en Chientan Youth Activity Center Official Website(Chinese)]</ref>(\u528d\u6f6d) in [[Taipei]] which is not to be confused with [[Jiantan Station|Jiantan]] subway station.\n\n==Origins of the Study Tour==\n[[File:Lb1969c.jpg|thumb|Cover of the 1969 Roster Book of the Overseas Chinese Youth Language Training and Study Tour.

The primary goal of the program was to acquaint, or re-acquaint, young people of Chinese descent living in other parts of the world with Chinese culture and language. Thus, participants take brief courses in language and arts, attend lectures, and take scenic tours of Taiwan. This however, is the popular perception of the program. The alternate and original purpose for the Taiwan Government's subsidizing of the program was to shore up [[Overseas Chinese]] support for its cross-strait political policies, particularly those of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) party in regards to its tense relations with China. Accordingly, participants were to attend lectures on cross-strait relations which others might perceive as propaganda. The program was conceived by the Taiwan Government in part because the [[Kuomintang]] for many decades had recognized the historical importance of the [[Overseas Chinese]] community not only for its financing but also for its political support.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23462345?seq=1 Taiwan and Overseas Chinese during the Cold War Era]</ref>  In fact Dr. [[Sun Yat-Sen]],<ref>[http://chinatown.library.uvic.ca/index.html%3Fq=sun_yat-sen.html Dr. Sun Yat-Sen]</ref> the founder of the [[Kuomintang]] as well as the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)]], recognized early the importance of [[Overseas Chinese]] support<ref>[https://www.straight.com/blogra/faces-vancouver-kuomintang-building-chinatown Sun Yat-Sen and Overseas Chinese history]</ref> and went as far as to say that \"Overseas Chinese are the Mother of the Revolution.<ref>[http://www.heroesofconfederation.com/Sun_Yat_Sen/sun_mission(1).html Sun Yat-Sen acknowledgement of Overseas Chinese]</ref>\"  However, beyond the political origins of the Study Tour, the program is most famous for its historically positive influence on Chinese American identity in addition to its \"[[Loveboat]]\" reputation of spawning many relationships as well hosting a frenetic nightlife scene which many participants indulged in.\n\n==Changes from 1967 to 1999==\n[[File:Lb1969a.jpg|thumb|Official 1969 Certificate of attendance for the Overseas Chinese Youth Language Training and Study Tour. Photo permission provided by [[Jan Wong]] and the Chinese Canadian Archive]]The Study Tour has gone through many changes over the years which correspond with Taiwan's changing politics and economy. After an experimental trial run in 1966 of only 5 students from North America<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/4271166/_Chinese_American_Transnationalism_Aboard_the_Love_Boat_The_Overseas_Youth_Language_Training_and_Study_Tour_to_the_Republic_of_China_ Chinese American Transnationalism aboard the Loveboat]</ref>, the [[China Youth Corps]] conducted the first official Study Tour in 1967 which hosted 70-100 participants from America and Canada, with an age range of between 14 and 25.  According to journalist [[Jan Wong]], a 1969 Study Tour participant, the first few years of the Study Tour program were held at [[Fu Jen Catholic University]]. As the popularity of the program grew, the number of participants increased and the headquarters moved to the Chientan Youth Activity Center in the 1970s located in the [[Shilin District]] near modern day [[Jiantan Station|Jiantan]] station.  During this time, the [[China Youth Corps]] had changed the name of the Study Tour to become \"Overseas Chinese Youth Language Training and Study Tour to the Republic of China,\" to be more in line with their political ideology. By the 1970s and 1980s, the average size of the program slowly grew to 300\u2013500 students up until 1988 and then in 1989 peaked exponentially at 1,200 participants. Due to the overwhelming increase in demand participants had to be placed in two separate campuses in 1990, one remaining at Chientan Campus and the other new one held at Taipei's [[Tam Kang Campus]].  During this time, and due to the increase in student size, the [[China Youth Corps]] came to share sponsoring responsibilities with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, which has since been renamed the [[Overseas Community Affairs Council]].\n\n[[File:Chientan.jpg|thumb|Chientan Youth Activity Center]]\nThis increase in enrolment coincided with both Taiwan's 1987 lifting of [[martial law]] and also its astronomical economic rise in the technology boom which greatly increased the island's reputation and prosperity. Further, because many originally skeptical participants were returning home with a greater appreciation of Taiwanese culture, improved Chinese language skills and were raving about the quality of the Tour to their family, this consequently led to good word of mouth about the program being spread within the international Chinese community.<ref>[http://www.click2asia.com/about/popup.php?x=news3 Direct link to August 3rd, 2004 Toronto Star article \"Finding a Mate Offshore\" by William Lin]</ref> This was especially pertinent in the 1970s and 1980s when Chinese communities were smaller than present day and a clear sense of \"Asian American identity\" for many North American born Chinese was nebulous at best. Many American-born Chinese who initially did not have any Chinese language skills and who refused to date a fellow Asian, returned from the Tour not only expressing a greater appreciation of Chinese language and culture but also a greater willingness to date within the Asian community.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20011209130536/http://www.geocities.com/jodeman.geo/loveboat.htm 'A More Complete Description of The Love Boat\" (English)]</ref>  There were many reasons for this, but especially for those participants who came from communities without many Chinese, the Study Tour provided a unique forum to share their common \"Chinese North American Experience\" of growing up and needing to reconcile both North American and Asian Cultures in a predominantly Caucasian society. This bonding not only produced several relationships but it also created many lifelong friendships. In addition, it did not hurt that during the trip, students were treated as \"little diplomats.\" This was witnessed during their police escorted bus trips to local Taipei landmarks where local traffic was essentially stopped for the convenience of their journey and to the relative chagrin of local Taiwanese commuters. This same sense of diplomacy was bestowed upon them at various military installations and cultural performances that students attended and were attempts by the program to ingratiate students with the people and culture of Taiwan. These various aspects of the Study Tour combined with the fact that 6 weeks of room and board (excluding airfare) only cost the participant $400 US dollars, due to Taiwan government subsidization, also led to increased popularity for the trip, as most agreed it was an excellent deal. \n[[File:224273 9461070452 3021 n.jpg|thumb|Students sneaking out of Chientan Campus at night to party]]\nHowever, a by-product of the Study Tour's increased popularity was increased competition by parents to register their children especially at large urban centers in New York and California. In fact, there were often waiting lists to get on the program and for some parents getting their child on the program became a symbol of status and often pertinent or high-ranking connections facilitated the application process for their child.  Some parents desiring their children to find a \"suitable Chinese spouse\"<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113166784230094239 The Loveboat Wall Street Journal Article]</ref> sent their unsuspecting children on the trip while telling them it was chiefly a Language Study Tour.  Conversely, some students who were interested in attending would often neglect to inform their parents about the Study Tour's [[Love Boat]] reputation for fear of not being allowed to go.  These concerns by some parents came from rumours that a few participants engaged in sexually promiscuous activity. On the other side of the spectrum, several Study Tour attendees did happen to fall in love and end up marrying each other. All these instances led to the Study Tour gaining its [[Love Boat]] nickname and reputation.<ref>[http://www.click2asia.com/about/index.php?y=inthenews ''Toronto Star'' 3 August 2004 article on the Study Tour re-published by Click2Asia.  Click2Asia indicates date and source of material (Toronto Star) in this link]</ref> Several unplanned pregnancies were however documented on the 1996 Study Tour which resulted in more stringent rules for subsequent tours; including rules against the opposite sex being present in the same dorm room and more strictly administered curfews. \n\n[[File:Loveboatclub.jpg|thumb|Study Tour students of the Love Boat enjoying an evening at a Taipei Dance Club]]\nThe job of implementing these many rules has traditionally been overseen by many local college-aged Taiwan counselors whose responsibilities, from early morning to late at night, consisted of organizing all the various logistics of the students' itinerary. This included organizing language/cultural classes, trips outings, speech contests, meals, medical care, guest speakers, and enforcing discipline which included trying to prevent (in vain) the students from sneaking out of the campus in the evening to enjoy the Taipei nightlife. Due to the sheer volume of minor misdeeds many counselors had to turn a blind eye and instead focused their energies on ensuring the safety and well being of the students. Becoming a Study Tour counselor for local Taiwanese was considered by many a badge of honour, as throughout the 1960s to the 1990s, the [[China Youth Corps]] only accepted local Taiwan applicants from the best Taiwan universities and degree programs in a rigorous selection process. For many counselors, the Study Tour was their very first contact with Chinese from abroad and many found the cultural exchange as life-changing as did the students who attended.\n\nAnother prerequisite of the Study Tour by the 1980s had become mandatory [[university]] enrolment, with a preference for students in [[Ivy League]] universities and students in their final year of university and thus near the age limit. Students with high academic achievements such as Presidential Scholars, Rhodes Scholars, or Truman Scholars were also given higher priority and were able to attend the Study Tour without charge.  Further rules stipulated that a family could only send one of its children at a time during any particular tour year so as to avoiding hoarding of spots by families. Exceptions were made however to twins and siblings from Europe. Participation had gradually increased from Europe, especially countries such as France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the UK. Countries such as Australia and those from South America and Africa also began sending small numbers of Study Tour participants. This contributed greatly to the sense of international community among [[Overseas Chinese]] worldwide.\n[[File:222318 9461130452 2683 n.jpg|thumb|CYC President Dr. Jeanne Li giving her final speech during the 2000 Study Tour Closing Ceremony]]\nBy the 1990s, the Study Tour had become a 6 week long program with an enrolment of 1200 participants aged from 18\u201323 with a management staff of over 80 Counselors.  As the size of the program expanded, more cultural classes were added to the existing language class education schedule. These classes now included calligraphy, cooking, Chinese medicine, Chinese yo-yo, fan dancing, flute, kung-fu, painting, paper cutting, stick-fighting, southern fiddle, sword-fighting, Taiwanese aboriginal dance, ribbon dancing, zither, and several others.  After 4 weeks of training, some students would perform what they learned during the \"Closing Ceremony\" in front of an audience of Study Tour participants and several high-level government officials at the Chientan Youth Activity Center auditorium.  This Closing Ceremony preceded the famous \"9 day trip down South\" which took all 1,200 study tour participants, in 4 separate groups, on a bus tour around the entire island of Taiwan to see the major scenic areas. These scenic attractions included [[Taroko National Park]], [[Sun Moon Lake]], [[Kenting National Park]], and [[Sanxiantai]], among others.  The end of the 9 day trip down South coincided with the end of the Study Tour and with all the students shortly returning (sometimes tearfully) to their countries of origin.\n\n==Addition of Ocean Campus in 1992==\n[[File:Ocean2.jpg|thumb|National Taiwan Ocean University Campus]]Starting in 1992, another memorable change occurred in the Study Tour in that Tam Kang Campus was replaced in use by [[Ocean Campus]] in [[Keelung]].  Many recall with fondness or revulsion the facilities of Ocean Campus.<ref>[http://www.explode.com/passport/taiwan.shtml Explode.com Study Tour Article \"Fear and Loathing in Taiwan\" (English)]</ref>  But by popular opinion, those students who were placed in Chientan Campus had the more comfortable facilities and the convenience to the nearby Shilin night market in Taipei.  In comparison, those students at Ocean Campus experienced slightly less convenient facilities albeit theirs did include more athletic and outdoor activities but unfortunately were a good cab ride away from the Taipei nightlife.  Without such amenities as Chientan campus, students at Ocean Campus often had no choice but to use their greater opportunities and free time at Ocean campus to communicate and bond.  Unfortunately, the idea and logistics behind a Campus switch between Chientan and Ocean would not come to fruition until the Study tour of 1996. During this switch, participants at Ocean and Chientan would switch campuses half-way during the Tour.  This type of switch would continue until the 2001 Study Tour.\n\n==Death of student in 1993 and subsequent lawsuit==\n[[File:Kenting.jpg|thumb|Bay of [[Kenting]], one of the scenic sites during \"The 9 day trip down South\"]]\nOne other reason for stricter rules involved the death of a student.  According to Valerie Soe's 2019 documentary \"Loveboat Taiwan<ref>[https://www.loveboat-taiwan.com/about Loveboat Taiwan documentary Official Website ]</ref>\", in August 1993 during that year's \"9 day trip down south\", a participant went against the wishes of the counselors to swim in the bay of [[Kenting]].  The student was caught in an undertow and subsequently drowned while others were attempting to rescue him.  His body was not found until it washed up several days later.  This embroiled the Study tour in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit which lasted many years and ended in a settlement.  Thus, stricter rules were created for the Study Tour overall not only for legal purposes but also for the protection of the students.  Although complete enforcement is extremely difficult for the counselors of the Tour,<ref>[http://www.click2asia.com/studytour/studytourfeature.html Article detailing Studytour in Mid 1990s (English)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070408160336/http://www.click2asia.com/studytour/studytourfeature.html |date=2007-04-08 }}</ref> students caught breaking major rules such as fighting, stealing, or sexual harassment are immediately sent home.\n\n==Changes from 2000 to 2012==\n[[File:Ktvtpe.jpg|thumb|Study Tour students enjoying a night at a Taipei KTV]]\nThe program maintained its number of participants and its program structure throughout the 1990s but this changed after the [[1999 Jiji earthquake]]. As a result, many parents were hesitant of sending their children to Taiwan. As a result, the number of participants in the year 2000 tour dropped to 800 as anyone who applied was accepted.  Further problems for the Study tour continued.  The Study Tour had historically been funded and supported by Taiwan's [[Kuomintang]] party since its inception in 1967.  After the 2000 Taiwan election, the incoming change of administration of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) did not fully support the aims or goals of the Study Tour.  As a result, funding was drastically cut and enrolment for the tour of 2001 was limited to 800 students.<ref>[http://www.heychristine.com/journals/06-13-01.html Article detailing study tour history (English)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116232224/http://www.heychristine.com/journals/06-13-01.html |date=2006-11-16 }}</ref> To cut costs, most students of that year were removed from the traditional Chientan building and moved to a smaller adjacent one that historically hosted the \"Baby Boat\", a much younger Study Tour, where participants were aged between 12\u201318. The cuts did not end there.  In 2002, due to lack of government support, the [[China Youth Corps]] which usually ran the program announced that it could no longer support a sizable number of students at Chientan for its 2002 Study Tour and that other organizations would have to pick up the slack.\n[[File:Militarytpe.jpg|thumb|Love Boat participants at a Taiwan military base in [[Kaoshiung]].  To meet its ideological aims, the Study Tour required students to attend demonstrations at various military bases and to attend lectures. ]]\nAs a result, in 2002 the Chientan campus hosted  about 100 students with other tour participants going to three other different campuses; including one campus near the Taipei Zoo and another in [[Taichung]].  The fourth group was the most unusual as they did not have a specific or permanent home base and spent most of their trip traveling around the island by bus.  This fourth group therefore, did not get nor require a \"Trip down South.\" There was no campus switch for this 2002 Study tour and each group hosted approximately 100 members.\n\nIn the over 50 year history of the Taiwan Study Tour, the students have survived through many travails such as earthquakes, typhoons, localized disease outbreaks, and even \nmissile threats/military posturing from China.  However, no Study Tour year was ever canceled due to these incidents except the 2003 year.  In 2003, the worldwide SARS outbreak caused the only ever cancellation of a Study Tour before it even began.  Parents were hesitant to send their children to Taiwan at the time and Tour organizers recognized the logistical nightmare due to widespread quarantine conditions.\n\nThe Study Tour resumed in 2004 with two groups and a new official name of \"Overseas Compatriot Youth Summer Formosa Study Tour.\"  One group remained at Chientan Campus which on this year included more strictly enforced 11pm bed checks.  Another group was located at Taichung.  The enrolment slowly increased with Chientan campus eventually housing up to 200 Study tour students with the potential for greater expansion. Due to the insistence by the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] between 2005-2007 there was increased pressure on the Study Tour to offer language classes in the Taiwanese dialect.  These changes did not last when the [[Kuomintang]] party returned to power in 2008 and the traditional classes in mandarin were again re-established.\n\n==Changes to Chientan Campus==\n[[File:Shilinloveboat.jpg|thumb|Students enjoying the famous [[Shilin Night Market]] near Chientan Campus]]\nThe Chientan Youth Activity Center has been a fixture in the [[Shilin District]] for decades since the [[China Youth Corps]] first acquired property rights to 65% of the land it sits on prior to 1988 with the remaining 35% being state owned in a relationship that was complex.  In 2015, there were calls by Taipei City politicians to demolish and remove the Chientan Youth Activity Center<ref>[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/05/03/2003617375Remove China Youth Corps\u2019 center: Taipei councilor]</ref> and to replace it with an arts center and park<ref>[https://www.eco-business.com/news/taipei-city-mulls-shilin-district-urban-renewal-plan/ Taipei City mulls Shilin District urban renewal plan</ref>.  Complicated negotiations between the [[China Youth Corps]] and the [[Taipei City Government]] continued into September 2016 until finally coming to a compromise.<ref>[https://english.geo.gov.taipei/News_Content.aspx?n=73D3E2CB30F6953F&sms=DFFA119D1FD5602C&s=127DCA87C2E42784] Taipei City Government has agreed on land resumption of Chientan Youth Activity Center and will continue the lease according to law</ref> Their agreement stipulated that by the end of 2024, all property rights to the Chientan Youth Activity Center would be transferred without compensation from the [[China Youth Corps]] to the [[Taipei City Government]].  What fate may lie for the Chientan Youth Activity Center after the beginning of 2025, whether it be renewal or demolition, remains unknown.\n\n==Changes from 2013 to current program==\n[[File:Loveboatclass.jpg|thumb|A typical Study Tour mandarin language class]]\nThe documentary \"Loveboat Taiwan\" further goes on to describe the dwindling number of students attending the Study Tour during the late 2000s up to the last larger-scale Study Tour year in 2013 which numbered at about 350 participants.  The number of Study Tour attendees dropped drastically after that year and currently sits at around 70-100 students accepted each summer.  Ironically, the current Study Tour being organized annually is similar in size to the very first Study Tour held in 1967 and is currently named \"Overseas Compatriot Youth Taiwan Study Tour.<ref>[https://www.ocac.gov.tw/OCAC/Eng/Pages/VDetail.aspx?nodeid=2169&pid=35039 \"Compatriot Youth Taiwan Study Tour Official Website\"]</ref>\"  It is now solely run by the [[Overseas Community Affairs Council]](OCAC) of Taiwan and according to its Official website<ref>[https://www.ocac.gov.tw/OCAC/Eng/ Overseas Community Affairs Council Official Website]</ref> the Study Tour is now only a 3 week long program with an age group of between 18 and 25 years old.  It is also just one of the OCAC's many \"expatriate\" programs it runs for visiting international students in the summer and throughout the year.   Due to the shorter period of time, language training is less stressed than in previous years and with comparatively less emphasis on cross-straight relations.  With far fewer cultural classes offered as in past Study Tours due to the much smaller number of students, the current Tour focuses on introducing participants to Taiwan history, culture, landmarks, and also includes \"participation in earth environmental activities and charitable activities\" as described in the OCAC's application form. Participants also get the unique opportunity to visit the Office of the President of Taiwan, re-establishing the important historical link between Overseas Chinese and Taiwanese to Taiwan's goal of establishing greater international support and recognition.\n\nEven though Chinese communities in North America now enjoy greater mainstream acceptance than they did over 50 years ago, and despite the fact modern Chinese North Americans youths may take associating with each other for granted as well as an unquestioned way of life, the goals and endeavours of the Taiwan Study Tour remain the same.\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe documentary [https://www.loveboat-taiwan.com/ ''Loveboat Taiwan''] by Valerie Soe was released in 2019 to film festivals internationally and to public acclaim receiving several awards.<ref>[ http://urbannomad.tw/2019urbannomadawards/?lang=en Audience choice award for Loveboat Taiwan]</ref>\n\nOn January 7, 2020 Harper Collins published Abigail Hing Wen's debut novel, [https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/23559994-loveboat-taipei ''Loveboat, Taipei''],<ref>[https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062957276/loveboat-taipei/ Loveboat, Taipei Novel]</ref> which made the New York Times best Top Ten best seller's list for Young Adult fiction.

The primary goal of the program was to acquaint, or re-acquaint, young people of Chinese descent living in other parts of the world with Chinese culture and language. Thus, participants take brief courses in language and arts, attend lectures, and take scenic tours of Taiwan. This however, is the popular perception of the program. The alternate and original purpose for the Taiwan Government's subsidizing of the program was to shore up [[Overseas Chinese]] support for its cross-strait political policies, particularly those of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) party in regards to its tense relations with China. Accordingly, participants were to attend lectures on cross-strait relations which others might perceive as propaganda. The program was conceived by the Taiwan Government in part because the [[Kuomintang]] for many decades had recognized the historical importance of the [[Overseas Chinese]] community not only for its financing but also for its political support.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23462345?seq=1 Taiwan and Overseas Chinese during the Cold War Era]</ref>  In fact Dr. [[Sun Yat-Sen]],<ref>[http://chinatown.library.uvic.ca/index.html%3Fq=sun_yat-sen.html Dr. Sun Yat-Sen]</ref> the founder of the [[Kuomintang]] as well as the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)]], recognized early the importance of [[Overseas Chinese]] support<ref>[https://www.straight.com/blogra/faces-vancouver-kuomintang-building-chinatown Sun Yat-Sen and Overseas Chinese history]</ref> and went as far as to say that \"Overseas Chinese are the Mother of the Revolution.<ref>[http://www.heroesofconfederation.com/Sun_Yat_Sen/sun_mission(1).html Sun Yat-Sen acknowledgement of Overseas Chinese]</ref>\"  However, beyond the political origins of the Study Tour, the program is most famous for its historically positive influence on Chinese American identity in addition to its \"[[Loveboat]]\" reputation of spawning many relationships as well hosting a frenetic nightlife scene which many participants indulged in.\n\n==Changes from 1967 to 1999==\n[[File:Lb1969a.jpg|thumb|Official 1969 Certificate of attendance for the Overseas Chinese Youth Language Training and Study Tour. Photo permission provided by [[Jan Wong]] and the Chinese Canadian Archive]]The Study Tour has gone through many changes over the years which correspond with Taiwan's changing politics and economy. After an experimental trial run in 1966 of only 5 students from North America<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/4271166/_Chinese_American_Transnationalism_Aboard_the_Love_Boat_The_Overseas_Youth_Language_Training_and_Study_Tour_to_the_Republic_of_China_ Chinese American Transnationalism aboard the Loveboat]</ref>, the [[China Youth Corps]] conducted the first official Study Tour in 1967 which hosted 70-100 participants from America and Canada, with an age range of between 14 and 25.  According to journalist [[Jan Wong]], a 1969 Study Tour participant, the first few years of the Study Tour program were held at [[Fu Jen Catholic University]]. As the popularity of the program grew, the number of participants increased and the headquarters moved to the Chientan Youth Activity Center in the 1970s located in the [[Shilin District]] near modern day [[Jiantan Station|Jiantan]] station.  During this time, the [[China Youth Corps]] had changed the name of the Study Tour to become \"Overseas Chinese Youth Language Training and Study Tour to the Republic of China,\" to be more in line with their political ideology. By the 1970s and 1980s, the average size of the program slowly grew to 300\u2013500 students up until 1988 and then in 1989 peaked exponentially at 1,200 participants. Due to the overwhelming increase in demand participants had to be placed in two separate campuses in 1990, one remaining at Chientan Campus and the other new one held at Taipei's [[Tam Kang Campus]].  During this time, and due to the increase in student size, the [[China Youth Corps]] came to share sponsoring responsibilities with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, which has since been renamed the [[Overseas Community Affairs Council]].\n\n[[File:Chientan.jpg|thumb|Chientan Youth Activity Center]]\nThis increase in enrolment coincided with both Taiwan's 1987 lifting of [[martial law]] and also its astronomical economic rise in the technology boom which greatly increased the island's reputation and prosperity. Further, because many originally skeptical participants were returning home with a greater appreciation of Taiwanese culture, improved Chinese language skills and were raving about the quality of the Tour to their family, this consequently led to good word of mouth about the program being spread within the international Chinese community.<ref>[http://www.click2asia.com/about/popup.php?x=news3 Direct link to August 3rd, 2004 Toronto Star article \"Finding a Mate Offshore\" by William Lin]</ref> This was especially pertinent in the 1970s and 1980s when Chinese communities were smaller than present day and a clear sense of \"Asian American identity\" for many North American born Chinese was nebulous at best. Many American-born Chinese who initially did not have any Chinese language skills and who refused to date a fellow Asian, returned from the Tour not only expressing a greater appreciation of Chinese language and culture but also a greater willingness to date within the Asian community.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20011209130536/http://www.geocities.com/jodeman.geo/loveboat.htm 'A More Complete Description of The Love Boat\" (English)]</ref>  There were many reasons for this, but especially for those participants who came from communities without many Chinese, the Study Tour provided a unique forum to share their common \"Chinese North American Experience\" of growing up and needing to reconcile both North American and Asian Cultures in a predominantly Caucasian society. This bonding not only produced several relationships but it also created many lifelong friendships.  In addition, it did not hurt that during the trip, students were treated as \"little diplomats.\"  This was witnessed during their police escorted bus trips to local Taipei landmarks where local traffic was essentially stopped for the convenience of their journey and to the relative chagrin of local Taiwanese commuters.  This same sense of diplomacy was bestowed upon them at various military installations and cultural performances that students attended and were attempts by the program to ingratiate students with the people and culture of Taiwan.  These various aspects of the Study Tour combined with the fact that 6 weeks of room and board(excluding airfare) only cost the participant $400 US dollars, due to Taiwan Government subsidization, also led to an increased popularity for the trip as most agreed it was an excellent deal. \n[[File:224273 9461070452 3021 n.jpg|thumb|Students sneaking out of Chientan Campus at night to party]]\nHowever, a by-product of the Study Tour's increased popularity was increased competition by parents to register their children especially at large urban centers in New York and California. In fact, there were often waiting lists to get on the program and for some parents getting their child on the program became a symbol of status and often pertinent or high-ranking connections facilitated the application process for their child.  Some parents desiring their children to find a \"suitable Chinese spouse\"<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113166784230094239 The Loveboat Wall Street Journal Article]</ref> sent their unsuspecting children on the trip while telling them it was chiefly a Language Study Tour.  Conversely, some students who were interested in attending would often neglect to inform their parents about the Study Tour's [[Love Boat]] reputation for fear of not being allowed to go.  These concerns by some parents came from rumours that a few participants engaged in sexually promiscuous activity. On the other side of the spectrum, several Study Tour attendees did happen to fall in love and end up marrying each other.  All these instances led to the Study Tour gaining its [[Love Boat]] nickname and reputation.<ref>[http://www.click2asia.com/about/index.php?y=inthenews ''Toronto Star'' 3 August 2004 article on the Study Tour re-published by Click2Asia.  Click2Asia indicates date and source of material (Toronto Star) in this link]</ref> Several unplanned pregnancies were however documented on the 1996 Study Tour which resulted in more stringent rules for subsequent tours; including rules against the opposite sex being present in the same dorm room and more strictly administered curfews. \n\n[[File:Loveboatclub.jpg|thumb|Study Tour students of the Love Boat enjoying an evening at a Taipei Dance Club]]\nThe job of implementing these many rules has traditionally been overseen by many local college-aged Taiwan counselors whose responsibilities, from early morning to late at night, consisted of organizing all the various logistics of the students' itinerary. This included organizing language/cultural classes, trips outings, speech contests, meals, medical care, guest speakers, and enforcing discipline which included trying to prevent(in vain) the students from sneaking out of the campus in the evening to enjoy the Taipei nightlife. Due to the sheer volume of minor misdeeds many counselors had to turn a blind eye and instead focused their energies on insuring the safety and well being of the students. Becoming a Study Tour counselor for local Taiwanese was considered by many a badge of honour, as throughout the 1960s to the 1990s, the [[China Youth Corps]] only accepted local Taiwan applicants from the best Taiwan universities and degree programs in a rigorous selection process. For many counselors, the Study Tour was their very first contact with Chinese from abroad and many found the cultural exchange as life-changing as did the students who attended.\n\nAnother prerequisite of the Study Tour by the 1980s had become mandatory [[university]] enrolment, with a preference for students in [[Ivy League]] universities and students in their final year of university and thus near the age limit. Students with high academic achievements such as Presidential Scholars, Rhodes Scholars, or Truman Scholars were also given higher priority and were able to attend the Study Tour without charge.  Further rules stipulated that a family could only send one of its children at a time during any particular tour year so as to avoiding hoarding of spots by families.  Exceptions were made however to twins and siblings from Europe.  Participation had gradually increased from Europe especially from the countries such as England, France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, and the Netherlands.  Countries such as Australia and those from South America and Africa also began sending small numbers of Study Tour participants.  This contributed greatly to the sense of international community among [[Overseas Chinese]] worldwide.\n[[File:222318 9461130452 2683 n.jpg|thumb|CYC President Dr. Jeanne Li giving her final speech during the 2000 Study Tour Closing Ceremony]]\nBy the 1990s, the Study Tour had become a 6 week long program with an enrolment of 1200 participants aged from 18\u201323 with a management staff of over 80 Counselors.  As the size of the program expanded, more cultural classes were added to the existing language class education schedule. These classes now included calligraphy, cooking, Chinese medicine, Chinese yo-yo, fan dancing, flute, kung-fu, painting, paper cutting, stick-fighting, southern fiddle, sword-fighting, Taiwanese aboriginal dance, ribbon dancing, zither, and several others.  After 4 weeks of training, some students would perform what they learned during the \"Closing Ceremony\" in front of an audience of Study Tour participants and several high-level government officials at the Chientan Youth Activity Center auditorium.  This Closing Ceremony preceded the famous \"9 day trip down South\" which took all 1,200 study tour participants, in 4 separate groups, on a bus tour around the entire island of Taiwan to see the major scenic areas. These scenic attractions included [[Taroko National Park]], [[Sun Moon Lake]], [[Kenting National Park]], and [[Sanxiantai]], among others.  The end of the 9 day trip down South coincided with the end of the Study Tour and with all the students shortly returning (sometimes tearfully) to their countries of origin.\n\n==Addition of Ocean Campus in 1992==\n[[File:Ocean2.jpg|thumb|National Taiwan Ocean University Campus]]Starting in 1992, another memorable change occurred in the Study Tour in that Tam Kang Campus was replaced in use by [[Ocean Campus]] in [[Keelung]].  Many recall with fondness or revulsion the facilities of Ocean Campus.<ref>[http://www.explode.com/passport/taiwan.shtml Explode.com Study Tour Article \"Fear and Loathing in Taiwan\" (English)]</ref>  But by popular opinion, those students who were placed in Chientan Campus had the more comfortable facilities and the convenience to the nearby Shilin night market in Taipei.  In comparison, those students at Ocean Campus experienced slightly less convenient facilities albeit theirs did include more athletic and outdoor activities but unfortunately were a good cab ride away from the Taipei nightlife.  Without such amenities as Chientan campus, students at Ocean Campus often had no choice but to use their greater opportunities and free time at Ocean campus to communicate and bond.  Unfortunately, the idea and logistics behind a Campus switch between Chientan and Ocean would not come to fruition until the Study tour of 1996. During this switch, participants at Ocean and Chientan would switch campuses half-way during the Tour.  This type of switch would continue until the 2001 Study Tour.\n\n==Death of student in 1993 and subsequent lawsuit==\n[[File:Kenting.jpg|thumb|Bay of [[Kenting]], one of the scenic sites during \"The 9 day trip down South\"]]\nOne other reason for stricter rules involved the death of a student.  According to Valerie Soe's 2019 documentary \"Loveboat Taiwan<ref>[https://www.loveboat-taiwan.com/about Loveboat Taiwan documentary Official Website ]</ref>\", in August 1993 during that year's \"9 day trip down south\", a participant went against the wishes of the counselors to swim in the bay of [[Kenting]].  The student was caught in an undertow and subsequently drowned while others were attempting to rescue him.  His body was not found until it washed up several days later.  This embroiled the Study tour in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit which lasted many years and ended in a settlement.  Thus, stricter rules were created for the Study Tour overall not only for legal purposes but also for the protection of the students.  Although complete enforcement is extremely difficult for the counselors of the Tour,<ref>[http://www.click2asia.com/studytour/studytourfeature.html Article detailing Studytour in Mid 1990s (English)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070408160336/http://www.click2asia.com/studytour/studytourfeature.html |date=2007-04-08 }}</ref> students caught breaking major rules such as fighting, stealing, or sexual harassment are immediately sent home.\n\n==Changes from 2000 to 2012==\n[[File:Ktvtpe.jpg|thumb|Study Tour students enjoying a night at a Taipei KTV]]\nThe program maintained its number of participants and its program structure throughout the 1990s but this changed after the [[1999 Jiji earthquake]]. As a result, many parents were hesitant of sending their children to Taiwan. As a result, the number of participants in the year 2000 tour dropped to 800 as anyone who applied was accepted.  Further problems for the Study tour continued.  The Study Tour had historically been funded and supported by Taiwan's [[Kuomintang]] party since its inception in 1967.  After the 2000 Taiwan election, the incoming change of administration of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) did not fully support the aims or goals of the Study Tour.  As a result, funding was drastically cut and enrolment for the tour of 2001 was limited to 800 students.<ref>[http://www.heychristine.com/journals/06-13-01.html Article detailing study tour history (English)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116232224/http://www.heychristine.com/journals/06-13-01.html |date=2006-11-16 }}</ref> To cut costs, most students of that year were removed from the traditional Chientan building and moved to a smaller adjacent one that historically hosted the \"Baby Boat\", a much younger Study Tour, where participants were aged between 12\u201318. The cuts did not end there.  In 2002, due to lack of government support, the [[China Youth Corps]] which usually ran the program announced that it could no longer support a sizable number of students at Chientan for its 2002 Study Tour and that other organizations would have to pick up the slack.\n[[File:Militarytpe.jpg|thumb|Love Boat participants at a Taiwan military base in [[Kaoshiung]].  To meet its ideological aims, the Study Tour required students to attend demonstrations at various military bases and to attend lectures. ]]\nAs a result, in 2002 the Chientan campus hosted  about 100 students with other tour participants going to three other different campuses; including one campus near the Taipei Zoo and another in [[Taichung]].  The fourth group was the most unusual as they did not have a specific or permanent home base and spent most of their trip traveling around the island by bus.  This fourth group therefore, did not get nor require a \"Trip down South.\" There was no campus switch for this 2002 Study tour and each group hosted approximately 100 members.\n\nIn the over 50 year history of the Taiwan Study Tour, the students have survived through many travails such as earthquakes, typhoons, localized disease outbreaks, and even \nmissile threats/military posturing from China.  However, no Study Tour year was ever canceled due to these incidents except the 2003 year.  In 2003, the worldwide SARS outbreak caused the only ever cancellation of a Study Tour before it even began.  Parents were hesitant to send their children to Taiwan at the time and Tour organizers recognized the logistical nightmare due to widespread quarantine conditions.\n\nThe Study Tour resumed in 2004 with two groups and a new official name of \"Overseas Compatriot Youth Summer Formosa Study Tour.\"  One group remained at Chientan Campus which on this year included more strictly enforced 11pm bed checks.  Another group was located at Taichung.  The enrolment slowly increased with Chientan campus eventually housing up to 200 Study tour students with the potential for greater expansion. Due to the insistence by the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] between 2005-2007 there was increased pressure on the Study Tour to offer language classes in the Taiwanese dialect.  These changes did not last when the [[Kuomintang]] party returned to power in 2008 and the traditional classes in mandarin were again re-established.\n\n==Changes to Chientan Campus==\n[[File:Shilinloveboat.jpg|thumb|Students enjoying the famous [[Shilin Night Market]] near Chientan Campus]]\nThe Chientan Youth Activity Center has been a fixture in the [[Shilin District]] for decades since the [[China Youth Corps]] first acquired property rights to 65% of the land it sits on prior to 1988 with the remaining 35% being state owned in a relationship that was complex.  In 2015, there were calls by Taipei City politicians to demolish and remove the Chientan Youth Activity Center<ref>[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/05/03/2003617375Remove China Youth Corps\u2019 center: Taipei councilor]</ref> and to replace it with an arts center and park<ref>[https://www.eco-business.com/news/taipei-city-mulls-shilin-district-urban-renewal-plan/ Taipei City mulls Shilin District urban renewal plan</ref>.  Complicated negotiations between the [[China Youth Corps]] and the [[Taipei City Government]] continued into September 2016 until finally coming to a compromise.<ref>[https://english.geo.gov.taipei/News_Content.aspx?n=73D3E2CB30F6953F&sms=DFFA119D1FD5602C&s=127DCA87C2E42784] Taipei City Government has agreed on land resumption of Chientan Youth Activity Center and will continue the lease according to law</ref> Their agreement stipulated that by the end of 2024, all property rights to the Chientan Youth Activity Center would be transferred without compensation from the [[China Youth Corps]] to the [[Taipei City Government]].  What fate may lie for the Chientan Youth Activity Center after the beginning of 2025, whether it be renewal or demolition, remains unknown.\n\n==Changes from 2013 to current program==\n[[File:Loveboatclass.jpg|thumb|A typical Study Tour mandarin language class]]\nThe documentary \"Loveboat Taiwan\" further goes on to describe the dwindling number of students attending the Study Tour during the late 2000s up to the last larger-scale Study Tour year in 2013 which numbered at about 350 participants.  The number of Study Tour attendees dropped drastically after that year and currently sits at around 70-100 students accepted each summer.  Ironically, the current Study Tour being organized annually is similar in size to the very first Study Tour held in 1967 and is currently named \"Overseas Compatriot Youth Taiwan Study Tour.<ref>[https://www.ocac.gov.tw/OCAC/Eng/Pages/VDetail.aspx?nodeid=2169&pid=35039 \"Compatriot Youth Taiwan Study Tour Official Website\"]</ref>\"  It is now solely run by the [[Overseas Community Affairs Council]](OCAC) of Taiwan and according to its Official website<ref>[https://www.ocac.gov.tw/OCAC/Eng/ Overseas Community Affairs Council Official Website]</ref> the Study Tour is now only a 3 week long program with an age group of between 18 and 25 years old.  It is also just one of the OCAC's many \"expatriate\" programs it runs for visiting international students in the summer and throughout the year.   Due to the shorter period of time, language training is less stressed than in previous years and with comparatively less emphasis on cross-straight relations.  With far fewer cultural classes offered as in past Study Tours due to the much smaller number of students, the current Tour focuses on introducing participants to Taiwan history, culture, landmarks, and also includes \"participation in earth environmental activities and charitable activities\" as described in the OCAC's application form. Participants also get the unique opportunity to visit the Office of the President of Taiwan, re-establishing the important historical link between Overseas Chinese and Taiwanese to Taiwan's goal of establishing greater international support and recognition.\n\nEven though Chinese communities in North America now enjoy greater mainstream acceptance than they did over 50 years ago, and despite the fact modern Chinese North Americans youths may take associating with each other for granted as well as an unquestioned way of life, the goals and endeavours of the Taiwan Study Tour remain the same.\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe documentary [https://www.loveboat-taiwan.com/ ''Loveboat Taiwan''] by Valerie Soe was released in 2019 to film festivals internationally and to public acclaim receiving several awards.<ref>[ http://urbannomad.tw/2019urbannomadawards/?lang=en Audience choice award for Loveboat Taiwan]</ref>\n\nOn January 7, 2020 Harper Collins published Abigail Hing Wen's debut novel, [https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/23559994-loveboat-taipei ''Loveboat, Taipei''],<ref>[https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062957276/loveboat-taipei/ Loveboat, Taipei Novel]</ref> which made the New York Times best Top Ten best seller's list for Young Adult fiction.
