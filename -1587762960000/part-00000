{"title_page": "Eleutheran Adventurers", "text_new": "{{short description|Group of English Puritans who left Bermuda for the Bahamas in the 1640s}}\n{{Refimprove|date=May 2010}}\n{{History of the Bahamas}}\nThe '''Eleutheran Adventurers''' were a group of English [[Puritan]]s and religious [[Independent (religion)|Independents]] who left [[Bermuda]] to settle on the island of [[Eleuthera]] in the [[Bahamas]] in the late 1640s.  The small group of Puritan settlers, led by a man named [[William Sayle]], were expelled from Bermuda for their failure to swear allegiance to the Crown, and left in search of a place in which they could freely practice their faith. This group represented the first concerted European effort to colonize [[the Bahamas]].\n\n==Background==\nThe mid-17th century was a  period of constant religious and political turmoil in [[England]], culminating in the [[English Civil War]]. The first part of the conflict was fought between King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and the [[Parliament of England]], and led ultimately to the [[The Protectorate|Protectorship]] of the Puritan general, [[Oliver Cromwell]]. This conflict spread to Bermuda, where a period of civil strife resulted in a victory for the supporters of the [[Cavalier|Loyalist]] party. The struggle eventually led to the expulsion of  the colony's Puritans and independents to the Bahamas, which the English had laid claim to in 1629, but had not permanently settled. Earlier in 1644, the [[Bermuda|Bermudian]] Independent Puritans had sent an expedition to explore these new islands, but one vessel was lost and the other failed to find a suitable island.\n\n==Establishment of the colony== \nNevertheless, sometime between spring 1646 and autumn 1648, Sayle took some seventy people to settle in the Bahamas. They made landfall on the island called Cigateo, which they named [[Eleutheria]], from the Greek word for \"freedom\", although the name later became Eleuthera.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eleuthera-map.com/eleuthera-island.htm|title=Eleuthera Island :: History Notes|author=|date=|work=eleuthera-map.com|accessdate=6 January 2017}}</ref> The island's original inhabitants, the [[Lucayan people|Lucayans]], had been decimated through the slaving activities of the Spanish and the numerous European diseases, especially [[smallpox]], that followed.\n\nWilliam Sayle and his assistant Captain Butler were the persons who began a voyage to The Bahamas in two different vessels. William Sayle's vessel was called the ''William''. During the voyage Captain Butler and William Sayle had an argument with each other about what religious freedom means. As a solution to this problem, Sayle left Captain Butler and went forward to reach the Bahamian Islands. The settlers ran into trouble before they even landed, when they encountered a storm and their ship ran aground onto rocks, later called the Devil's Backbone, north of [[Spanish Wells]]. The adventurers found their way ashore and took refuge in what was later called Preacher's Cave, where a religious service was held every year for the next 100 years on the anniversary in thankfulness for their survival. However, although the settlers had shelter, they had lost their provisions so they had no food. Sayle took eight men in a small boat and went to Virginia to help, where he got a ship and supplies and went to relieve the others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jabezcorner.com/Grand_Bahama/1647_articles.htm|title=Articles and Orders, Bahamas 1647|author=|date=|work=jabezcorner.com|accessdate=6 January 2017}}</ref> More colonists expelled from Bermuda arrived in 1649 and also faced the predicament of inadequate supplies.

On the contrary, the articles speak of the rules governing  the ''Members of the Republick'' and the ''Magistracie or officers of the Republicke''. The articles established freedom of religion and opinion, three hundred acres of land per settler, governance under a governor and twelve councillors chosen from a senate composed of the first 100 settlers, and humane treatment of any indigenous people still on the island. It has been noted that if Sayle's settlement had been successful, then he would have created in the Bahamas \"the first democratic state in the New World\", some 130 years before the American Revolution.<ref>{{cite book | authors = Riley, Sandra  (foreword by Thelma B.

McMillan was elected by peers to lead the Nuclear Security Enterprise Integration Council.\nEstablished in 1943 as part of the Manhattan Project, Los Alamos National Laboratory is a principal contributor to NNSAs' programs to maintain the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile and to reduce the international dangers posed by weapons of mass destruction.<ref>http://www.nnsa.energy.gov/</ref>\n\n[[File:Charles McMillan United States Senate testimony.jpg|thumb|right|Charles F.

The service we provide to the nation is as important now as it ever was.\"\n\nSumming up his philosophy on how science is best managed, McMillan quoted from the collection of Lewis Thomas essays, Lives of a Cell: \"What [research] needs is for the air to be made right. If you want a bee to make honey, you do not issue protocols on solar navigation or carbohydrate chemistry, you put him together with other bees . . . and you do what you can to arrange the general environment around the hive. If the air is right, the science will come in its own season, like pure honey.\"\n\n==Events==\nDr. Charles F.

McMillan had been Principal Associate Director for Weapons Programs at Los Alamos and joined the laboratory in 2006, where he was responsible for directing the science, technology, engineering, and infrastructure that enables the Laboratory to deliver on its core mission of ensuring the safety, reliability, and performance of the nation's nuclear deterrent. McMillan was elected by peers to lead the Nuclear Security Enterprise Integration Council.\nEstablished in 1943 as part of the Manhattan Project, Los Alamos National Laboratory is a principal contributor to NNSAs' programs to maintain the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile and to reduce the international dangers posed by weapons of mass destruction.<ref>http://www.nnsa.energy.gov/</ref>\n\n[[File:Charles McMillan United States Senate testimony.jpg|thumb|right|Charles F.

He is married with three college-age children. He is also an avid photographer and accomplished musician, playing piano, organ, and recorder. McMillan continues to perform in a baroque chamber music ensemble.\n\n==Quotes==\n\"I have great optimism for the future,\" said McMillan. \"This is a complicated time but also a time of great opportunity for the program, an opportunity to work with the Administration to shape tomorrow\u2019s nuclear security complex while effectively managing the nuclear stockpile along the way. The service we provide to the nation is as important now as it ever was.\"\n\nSumming up his philosophy on how science is best managed, McMillan quoted from the collection of Lewis Thomas essays, Lives of a Cell: \"What [research] needs is for the air to be made right. If you want a bee to make honey, you do not issue protocols on solar navigation or carbohydrate chemistry, you put him together with other bees . . . and you do what you can to arrange the general environment around the hive. If the air is right, the science will come in its own season, like pure honey.\"\n\n==Events==\nDr. Charles F. McMillan presented a lecture on: \"The Timeline of Technology\", offering examples of how innovations in the 20th century are used in this century to solve national and global security, energy and environmental issues, on October 1, 2014, at [[Howard H.
