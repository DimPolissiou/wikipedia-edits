It was seen necessary that a cultural reorganisation of the nation should come through the institutional infrastructure of the state. The state patronage was not for the art, but for the artists, who using the physical environment and infrastructural facilities\u00a0 provided to them could carry on with their art. Unlike private institutions which could change their program of support depending on market conditions, the Lalit Kala Akademi sought to support all forms of art \u2014 studio, experimental, developmental, \u2018folk\u2019, \u2018tribal\u2019, etc.\n\nIn constructing a national heritage of India, \u2014 ancient, medieval, as well as modern lineages were to be taken into account. In the wake of the [[Indian independence movement|anti-colonial independence movement]], the developments in Modern Art drew from the underlying currents that linked modernity with an inherited, indigenous past. The art-historian [http://parthamitter.com Partha Mitter],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Art and nationalism in colonial India 1850-1922 : occidental orientations|last=Mitter, Partha.|date=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521443547|oclc=780034304}}</ref> has argued that Modern Art in India developed through a series of interactions and frictions between \u201ccolonial hegemony and national self-image\u201d. Emerging out of the colonial encounter with the Western \u201cother\u201d, the options available were within the confines of colonial ideologies as well as colonial institutions of art.\n\n[https://www.anubhamehta.com Anubha Mehta] notes that the Gandhian movement was a political one, and not a social one. There were only a few phases when the artists were directly involved. Most important was the moment of [[Nandalal Bose]]\u2019s involvement. From 1920, some occasional exhibitions of paintings coincided with the sessions of the [[History of the Indian National Congress|Indian National Congress]]. In 1936, [[Nandalal Bose]] responded to [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]]\u2019s summons to organise an exhibition of Indian art at the Lucknow session of the INC. From hereon, the project of placing exhibitions of a continuous history of Indian art became important.<ref name=\":0\">Mehta, Anubha. ''State and culture : a case study of Lalit Kala Akademi ; the national academy of visual arts, New Delhi (1954-1999)'' (New Delhi: Jawaharlal Nehru University, 2000. Unpublished.)</ref> In 1937, the entire Congress township at Faizpur in Maharashtra was designed as an ideological statement by prominent Modern artists. By 1938, the INC pavilions at [[Haripura]] were decorated by artists from [[Santiniketan Art Movement|Shantiniketan]] led by [[Nandalal Bose]]. Drawing stylistic inspiration from \u2018folk\u2019 art, the subject matter was rural life, and ordinary people. This was an important moment in India's history of Modern Art as it revelled in the affinity with folk, which seemed to underline an imaginative and technical range that had a richer visual vocabulary that of [[Academic art|Western Academism]]. This art made to appeal both the connoisseur and the common man. This came to be the nationalist alternative that was firmly in opposition to the colonial art establishment. The multiplicity of responses of the Indian artists to western modes of art served as a catalytic force and created a foundation for exploring what could be the specific Indian character of modern Indian art. This very cause, of the Indian character, was taken up by the Lalit Kala Akademi when it was established in 1954.<ref name=\":0\" /> \u00a0\n\nArtists like [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Jamini Roy]], [[Abanindranath Tagore]] came to be seen as \u2018authentic\u2019 because their subject matter incorporated many folk idioms that they inculcated overtime through their involvement in the Gandhian phase of the nationalist movement after 1920. These idioms were accommodated, aestheticised, and modernised into the canon of Indian Modernism. The selective focus of the official cultural discourse became a major factor in defining Modern Art in India. In 1950, the President commissioned [[Nandalal Bose]] to do a set of paintings for the original hand written manuscript of the Indian constitution. He was later bestowed with various national awards and his work was celebrated as that of a \u2018national artist\u2019. The Lalit Kala Akademi sold his paintings as a special portfolio (1982\u201383) in all their centenary publications as a landmark in modern art.\n\nIn adherence to this idea of nationalism in modern Indian art, [[Abul Kalam Azad|Maulana Azad]], the Minister of Education set up the Lalit Kala Akademi so that the state could carry forward the cultural renaissance in India and patronise art with an impact and reach across India.\n\nBy the 1940s, there was an emergence of organised groups of artists in Calcutta, Bombay, Delhi, and Madras. There were some prominent organisations in Delhi which worked towards the promotion of visual arts in the country. Important among them were the Sarada Ukil School of art, the All India Fine Arts and Crafts Society and the Delhi Shilpi Chakra. The Minister of Education had also set up an art department in the Delhi Polytechnic in 1942.\n\n== Formation ==\nAs the national academy of fine arts, the Lalit Kala Akademi was envisioned with a clear perspective regarding its purpose as a National institutions. It was established on August 5, 1954. [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] envisioned the LKA as being democratic in its reach, membership and functioning, whereas [[Abul Kalam Azad|Azad]]\u2019s idea of it was based on the line of the [[French academies|French Academy]] which had a rather exclusivist criteria. Contradictions like these abound. While one of the constitutional objects of the LKA in 1954 was to preserve and project art forms of surviving indigenous craftsmen, painters, and sculptors, the \u201cCreative Arts\u201d as defined in the 1954 constitution are only paintings, sculpture, and graphics. In 1978, the rules of participation of the Triennial stated that the art forms constantly referred to as \u2018folk\u2019, \u2018tribal\u2019, and \u2018tradition\u2019 would not be allowed as they are not in the ambit of the \"contemporary\". Even as the organisation wanted to organise itself at an All India level, there is not a single official document professing linkages between the State Lalit Kala Akademis, Regional Centres, and the Zonal Cultural Centres.<ref name=\":0\" /> The orientations of the officials at the helm of the organisation and their professional credentials have constantly affected the nature of design, legislation, and implementation of LKA's programmes. The initial thrust of LKA's responsibilities emerged from conceptual framework of the founding father. [[Abul Kalam Azad|Azad]] defined the role of LKA as\u00a0 \u201cproviding facilities for training the sensibilities by the practise of one of the fine arts\u201d. The purpose was to develop finer aspects of the citizen's personality.\n\nThe conflict in the constitutional objectives led to much confusion about its policy perspective especially in determining its nature as either an exclusive, elite organisation or as a one that was democratic in approach and functioning. In an absence of a clearly stated programme, LKA ended up being both.<ref name=\":0\" /> Both Nehru and Azad agreed in granting the members of the LKA total autonomy regarding internal functioning and programme legislation. Majority of the programmer were designed and carried forwards within the elite circuits of art forms and artists. This elite orientation also affected the forms of visual arts incorporated. For instance, in the 1940s and 50s, the contemporary art scene saw a predominance of painters. Consequently, the artists accommodated in the official rolls of the newly founded LKA ended up being mostly painters. Therefore, LKA was established largely as an Akademi of painters.\n\nThe constitutional objectives along with the institutional functioning of the LKA have been reviewed on three occasions by committees appointed by the government of India.\n\n* Bhabha committee in 1962\n* Khosla committee National Exhibition of Artin 1972\n* Haksar committee in 1992\n\n== Activities ==\n\n=== National Exhibition of Art ===\nIn the formative years, a lot of emphasis was laid on the Exhibitions to establish the institutional personality of the LKA. The first seven years saw a lot of fanfare in terms of activities and were always inaugurated by the president and vice-president of India. As early as 1955\u201356, LKA sent its first exhibition abroad with a two-member delegation for the period of one year to six countries. Through its international exhibitions programme, it sought National Exhibition of Art to justify itself not only to India but to the world.\n\nThe National Exhibition of Art (NEA) is the most prestigious annual event organised by the LKA. Every year it exhibits and awards artists. From 1958 until the 1980s, the LKA followed a practice of purchasing works during the NEAs annually to add to their permanent collection. The objective was to created a museum of acclaimed artworks with the LKA that was purchased through its own exhibitions. From the 1980s, the LKA developed a practice of carrying exhibitions of artworks from their permanent collection under a particular theme. In 1997, the government took over the management fo the LKA for some years and the programme of purchasing artworks was abandoned, among the reasons cited was the kind of control commanded by private art galleries over the art market.\n\n=== Rashtriya Kala Melas ===\nThe Rashtriya Kala Mela, as art fairs became a regular complementary feature of the Triennale. They were seen as events that widened the scope of the Triennale and formed the basis of a national cultural festival that could emrace of the arts.\n\n=== Garhi Studios ===\nThe LKA provided for the Garhi Studios as an institutional facility for the organisation of semianrs, artist workshops, lecture demonstrations, and exhibitions. Beginning with the establishment of eight studios at Bistidari Malcha Mahal in New Delhi, it was expanded to thirty six studios \u2014 including thirty two individual studios and four community studios. It has become a center for arranging exhibitions, ceremonial events, artists\u2019 camps, semiars etc. The functions it performs are much beyond the scope of a studio. For instance, in the 1978 Triennale, the Garhi center was a major activity hub. Souvenirs were made by these studios for the foreign dignitaries and its grounds were used to hist meetings, camps, on-the-spot workshops, and displays.\n\n== The Triennale-India ==\nIn 1968, the LKA started its ambitious programme aiming to enter the international art circuit with the Triennale-India exhibitions. In these exhibitions, a host of countries were invited to participate in New Delhi at regular intervals of 3\u20134 years. It began at a point in time when the purposed of such international exhibitions in the west was already being questioned.<ref name=\":0\" /> There were however many who believed in the potential of the Triennale as a pre-requisite for an internationalism of the arts. With the end of colonialism, new dimensions, context and idioms were developing - and the Triennale aimed not only at creating a meeting ground for artists from the global south but also for those of the industrially developed countries.\n\n[[Nancy Adajania]] writes how the Triennale echos the rhetoric surrounding internationalism as not necessarily a monopoly of the industrially advanced societies of West Europe and North America.<ref name=\":1\">Nancy Adajania, \u2018Globalism Before Globalisation: The Ambivalent Fate of Triennale India\u2019 in Shanay Jhaveri ed.,Western Artists and India: Creative Inspirations in Art and Design (Bombay: The Shoestring Publisher, 2013).</ref> It was an assertion that the societies of the [[global South]] could stake an equal claim in articulating a vision of the world. The Triennale had its roots in the [[Non-Aligned Movement|Non-Alignment Movement]]\u2019s notion of the third-way or third position in global politics. '''[[Mulk Raj Anand]]''', who proposed and founded the Triennale saw treated non-alignment as a \u201cgenealogical matrix\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> Centered around Anand's creative humanist approach, the first edition of Triennale India brought together 609 works from 31 countries.\n\nIn the 1970s, [[Vivan Sundaram]]\u2019s protest\u00a0 against the Triennale was emanting from the emphasis on the international that overlooked and marginalised Indian's own complex history. Among the many reasons behind the protest was also to call for a democratisation of the working of the LKA. The acclaimed art-crtitc [[Geeta Kapur]] emerged as one of the most vehement critics of the Triennale as she recognised their narrow economism as an extension of the international art exhibitions with vested commercial interests of commercial art dealers operating at the behest of both public and private, individual and national agents. \u00a0\n\nBecause of this international outlook, the Triennale became a priority overshadowing other roles and responsibilities. It became more important than the constitutional objectives of development, encouragement, and promotion of existing forms of contemporary Indian Art. The representations at the Triennale were to be a reputed and acclaimed stature, and this led to a shift in focus from the art form to the artist. It was in the mid-60s through the Triennale that the LKA made a statement on the state of arts in India. According to LKA, the contemporary Indian art had taken a definitive turn towards the individual experiences and ideas. In March 1977, the Triennale Committee declared that a strong Indian section could only be presented if the Triennale was not treated as a ground for exploring new talent, something that the NEA could take care of.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Centers<ref>[http://www.lalitkala.gov.in/history/activities.html About us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011045918/http://www.lalitkala.gov.in/history/activities.html |date=2011-10-11 }}</ref> ==\n\n*[[Bhubaneswar]]\n*[[Chennai]]\n*[[Bangalore]]\n*Garhi [[Delhi]]\n*[[Kolkata]]\n*[[Lucknow]]\n*[[Shimla]]\n\n==Chairman==\n* On 17 May 2018 Honorable President [[Ram Nath Kovind]] has appointed [[Uttam Pacharne]], an Artist, and sculptor as chairman of the Lalit Kala Akademi.

He was charged with misappropriation of funds. So, in mid-2017, the ministry had instituted a three-member inquiry committee to probe some allegations of misuse of finances against Setty. Later, this order was withdrawn on 16 August 2017. The Delhi high court, which has been hearing a PIL alleging misappropriation of funds at the national arts body, had sought an explanation from the ministry on 24 August 2017, about it. However, the ministry hasn't replied. The next date of hearing of the case was 8 May. So, the ministry finally decided to let Setty go in the first week of April 2018, after the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), in 2017, took note of repeated complaints, including missing artworks of the celebrated painter M.F. Husain from the Akademi. But in a reply to a newspaper, He said, \"M.F. Husain\u2019s work disappeared (from the Lalit Kala Akademi) long ago.

In April 2015, [[Government of India]] took over management control of Lalit Kala Akademi citing complaints regarding alleged administrative and financial irregularities in its functioning.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/govt-takes-over-lalit-kala-akademi-s-management-115040601123_1.html | title=Govt takes over Lalit Kala Akademi's management | date=6 April 2015 | newspaper=Business Standard | author=Press Trust of India | accessdate=28 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAfter achieving independence in 1947, the leaders of the nationalist movement realised the value of culture as a vehicle of interaction and its importance in shaping not only the Indian identity on its own, but also carving out an sphere of interaction where other art forms would further the cause of national unity. It was seen necessary that a cultural reorganisation of the nation should come through the institutional infrastructure of the state. The state patronage was not for the art, but for the artists, who using the physical environment and infrastructural facilities\u00a0 provided to them could carry on with their art. Unlike private institutions which could change their program of support depending on market conditions, the Lalit Kala Akademi sought to support all forms of art \u2014 studio, experimental, developmental, \u2018folk\u2019, \u2018tribal\u2019, etc.\n\nIn constructing a national heritage of India, \u2014 ancient, medieval, as well as modern lineages were to be taken into account. In the wake of the [[Indian independence movement|anti-colonial independence movement]], the developments in Modern Art drew from the underlying currents that linked modernity with an inherited, indigenous past. The art-historian [http://parthamitter.com Partha Mitter],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Art and nationalism in colonial India 1850-1922 : occidental orientations|last=Mitter, Partha.|date=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521443547|oclc=780034304}}</ref> has argued that Modern Art in India developed through a series of interactions and frictions between \u201ccolonial hegemony and national self-image\u201d. Emerging out of the colonial encounter with the Western \u201cother\u201d, the options available were within the confines of colonial ideologies as well as colonial institutions of art.\n\n[https://www.anubhamehta.com Anubha Mehta] notes that the Gandhian movement was a political one, and not a social one. There were only a few phases when the artists were directly involved. Most important was the moment of [[Nandalal Bose]]\u2019s involvement. From 1920, some occasional exhibitions of paintings coincided with the sessions of the [[History of the Indian National Congress|Indian National Congress]]. In 1936, [[Nandalal Bose]] responded to [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]]\u2019s summons to organise an exhibition of Indian art at the Lucknow session of the INC. From hereon, the project of placing exhibitions of a continuous history of Indian art became important.<ref name=\":0\">Mehta, Anubha. ''State and culture : a case study of Lalit Kala Akademi ; the national academy of visual arts, New Delhi (1954-1999)'' (New Delhi: Jawaharlal Nehru University, 2000. Unpublished.)</ref> In 1937, the entire Congress township at Faizpur in Maharashtra was designed as an ideological statement by prominent Modern artists. By 1938, the INC pavilions at [[Haripura]] were decorated by artists from [[Santiniketan Art Movement|Shantiniketan]] led by [[Nandalal Bose]]. Drawing stylistic inspiration from \u2018folk\u2019 art, the subject matter was rural life, and ordinary people. This was an important moment in India's history of Modern Art as it revelled in the affinity with folk, which seemed to underline an imaginative and technical range that had a richer visual vocabulary that of [[Academic art|Western Academism]]. This art made to appeal both the connoisseur and the common man. This came to be the nationalist alternative that was firmly in opposition to the colonial art establishment. The multiplicity of responses of the Indian artists to western modes of art served as a catalytic force and created a foundation for exploring what could be the specific Indian character of modern Indian art. This very cause, of the Indian character, was taken up by the Lalit Kala Akademi when it was established in 1954.<ref name=\":0\" /> \u00a0\n\nArtists like [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Jamini Roy]], [[Abanindranath Tagore]] came to be seen as \u2018authentic\u2019 because their subject matter incorporated many folk idioms that they inculcated overtime through their involvement in the Gandhian phase of the nationalist movement after 1920. These idioms were accommodated, aestheticised, and modernised into the canon of Indian Modernism. The selective focus of the official cultural discourse became a major factor in defining Modern Art in India. In 1950, the President commissioned [[Nandalal Bose]] to do a set of paintings for the original hand written manuscript of the Indian constitution. He was later bestowed with various national awards and his work was celebrated as that of a \u2018national artist\u2019. The Lalit Kala Akademi sold his paintings as a special portfolio (1982\u201383) in all their centenary publications as a landmark in modern art.\n\nIn adherence to this idea of nationalism in modern Indian art, [[Abul Kalam Azad|Maulana Azad]], the Minister of Education set up the Lalit Kala Akademi so that the state could carry forward the cultural renaissance in India and patronise art with an impact and reach across India.\n\nBy the 1940s, there was an emergence of organised groups of artists in Calcutta, Bombay, Delhi, and Madras. There were some prominent organisations in Delhi which worked towards the promotion of visual arts in the country. Important among them were the Sarada Ukil School of art, the All India Fine Arts and Crafts Society and the Delhi Shilpi Chakra. The Minister of Education had also set up an art department in the Delhi Polytechnic in 1942.\n\n== Formation ==\nAs the national academy of fine arts, the Lalit Kala Akademi was envisioned with a clear perspective regarding its purpose as a National institutions. It was established on August 5, 1954. [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] envisioned the LKA as being democratic in its reach, membership and functioning, whereas [[Abul Kalam Azad|Azad]]\u2019s idea of it was based on the line of the [[French academies|French Academy]] which had a rather exclusivist criteria. Contradictions like these abound. While one of the constitutional objects of the LKA in 1954 was to preserve and project art forms of surviving indigenous craftsmen, painters, and sculptors, the \u201cCreative Arts\u201d as defined in the 1954 constitution are only paintings, sculpture, and graphics. In 1978, the rules of participation of the Triennial stated that the art forms constantly referred to as \u2018folk\u2019, \u2018tribal\u2019, and \u2018tradition\u2019 would not be allowed as they are not in the ambit of the \"contemporary\". Even as the organisation wanted to organise itself at an All India level, there is not a single official document professing linkages between the State Lalit Kala Akademis, Regional Centres, and the Zonal Cultural Centres.<ref name=\":0\" /> The orientations of the officials at the helm of the organisation and their professional credentials have constantly affected the nature of design, legislation, and implementation of LKA's programmes. The initial thrust of LKA's responsibilities emerged from conceptual framework of the founding father. [[Abul Kalam Azad|Azad]] defined the role of LKA as\u00a0 \u201cproviding facilities for training the sensibilities by the practise of one of the fine arts\u201d. The purpose was to develop finer aspects of the citizen's personality.\n\nThe conflict in the constitutional objectives led to much confusion about its policy perspective especially in determining its nature as either an exclusive, elite organisation or as a one that was democratic in approach and functioning. In an absence of a clearly stated programme, LKA ended up being both.<ref name=\":0\" /> Both Nehru and Azad agreed in granting the members of the LKA total autonomy regarding internal functioning and programme legislation. Majority of the programmer were designed and carried forwards within the elite circuits of art forms and artists. This elite orientation also affected the forms of visual arts incorporated. For instance, in the 1940s and 50s, the contemporary art scene saw a predominance of painters. Consequently, the artists accommodated in the official rolls of the newly founded LKA ended up being mostly painters. Therefore, LKA was established largely as an Akademi of painters.\n\nThe constitutional objectives along with the institutional functioning of the LKA have been reviewed on three occasions by committees appointed by the government of India.\n\n* Bhabha committee in 1962\n* Khosla committee National Exhibition of Artin 1972\n* Haksar committee in 1992\n\n== Activities ==\n\n=== National Exhibition of Art ===\nIn the formative years, a lot of emphasis was laid on the Exhibitions to establish the institutional personality of the LKA. The first seven years saw a lot of fanfare in terms of activities and were always inaugurated by the president and vice-president of India. As early as 1955-56, LKA sent its first exhibition abroad with a two-member delegation for the period of one year to six countries. Through its international exhibitions programme, it sought National Exhibition of Art to justify itself not only to India but to the world.\n\nThe National Exhibition of Art (NEA) is the most prestigious annual event organised by the LKA. Every year it exhibits and awards artists. From 1958 until the 1980s, the LKA followed a practice of purchasing works during the NEAs annually to add to their permanent collection. The objective was to created a museum of acclaimed artworks with the LKA that was purchased through its own exhibitions. From the 1980s, the LKA developed a practice of carrying exhibitions of artworks from their permanent collection under a particular theme. In 1997, the government took over the management fo the LKA for some years and the programme of purchasing artworks was abandoned, among the reasons cited was the kind of control commanded by private art galleries over the art market.\n\n=== Rashtriya Kala Melas ===\nThe Rashtriya Kala Mela, as art fairs became a regular complementary feature of the Triennale. They were seen as events that widened the scope of the Triennale and formed the basis of a national cultural festival that could emrace of the arts.\n\n=== Garhi Studios ===\nThe LKA provided for the Garhi Studios as an institutional facility for the organisation of semianrs, artist workshops, lecture demonstrations, and exhibitions. Beginning with the establishment of eight studios at Bistidari Malcha Mahal in New Delhi, it was expanded to thirty six studios \u2014 including thirty two individual studios and four community studios. It has become a center for arranging exhibitions, ceremonial events, artists\u2019 camps, semiars etc. The functions it performs are much beyond the scope of a studio. For instance, in the 1978 Triennale, the Garhi center was a major activity hub. Souvenirs were made by these studios for the foreign dignitaries and its grounds were used to hist meetings, camps, on-the-spot workshops, and displays.\n\n== The Triennale-India ==\nIn 1968, the LKA started its ambitious programme aiming to enter the international art circuit with the Triennale-India exhibitions. In these exhibitions, a host of countries were invited to participate in New Delhi at regular intervals of 3\u20134 years. It began at a point in time when the purposed of such international exhibitions in the west was already being questioned.<ref name=\":0\" /> There were however many who believed in the potential of the Triennale as a pre-requisite for an internationalism of the arts. With the end of colonialism, new dimensions, context and idioms were developing - and the Triennale aimed not only at creating a meeting ground for artists from the global south but also for those of the industrially developed countries.\n\n[[Nancy Adajania]] writes how the Triennale echos the rhetoric surrounding internationalism as not necessarily a monopoly of the industrially advanced societies of West Europe and North America.<ref name=\":1\">Nancy Adajania, \u2018Globalism Before Globalisation: The Ambivalent Fate of Triennale India\u2019 in Shanay Jhaveri ed.,Western Artists and India: Creative Inspirations in Art and Design (Bombay: The Shoestring Publisher, 2013).</ref> It was an assertion that the societies of the [[global South]] could stake an equal claim in articulating a vision of the world. The Triennale had its roots in the [[Non-Aligned Movement|Non-Alignment Movement]]\u2019s notion of the third-way or third position in global politics. '''[[Mulk Raj Anand]]''', who proposed and founded the Triennale saw treated non-alignment as a \u201cgenealogical matrix\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> Centered around Anand's creative humanist approach, the first edition of Triennale India brought together 609 works from 31 countries.\n\nIn the 1970s, [[Vivan Sundaram]]\u2019s protest\u00a0 against the Triennale was emanting from the emphasis on the international that overlooked and marginalised Indian's own complex history. Among the many reasons behind the protest was also to call for a democratisation of the working of the LKA. The acclaimed art-crtitc [[Geeta Kapur]] emerged as one of the most vehement critics of the Triennale as she recognised their narrow economism as an extension of the international art exhibitions with vested commercial interests of commercial art dealers operating at the behest of both public and private, individual and national agents. \u00a0\n\nBecause of this international outlook, the Triennale became a priority overshadowing other roles and responsibilities. It became more important than the constitutional objectives of development, encouragement, and promotion of existing forms of contemporary Indian Art. The representations at the Triennale were to be a reputed and acclaimed stature, and this led to a shift in focus from the art form to the artist. It was in the mid-60s through the Triennale that the LKA made a statement on the state of arts in India. According to LKA, the contemporary Indian art had taken a definitive turn towards the individual experiences and ideas. In March 1977, the Triennale Committee declared that a strong Indian section could only be presented if the Triennale was not treated as a ground for exploring new talent, something that the NEA could take care of.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Centers<ref>[http://www.lalitkala.gov.in/history/activities.html About us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011045918/http://www.lalitkala.gov.in/history/activities.html |date=2011-10-11 }}</ref> ==\n\n*[[Bhubaneswar]]\n*[[Chennai]]\n*[[Bangalore]]\n*Garhi [[Delhi]]\n*[[Kolkata]]\n*[[Lucknow]]\n*[[Shimla]]\n\n==Chairman==\n* On 17 May 2018 Honorable President [[Ram Nath Kovind]] has appointed [[Uttam Pacharne]], an Artist, and sculptor as chairman of the Lalit Kala Akademi.

He was charged with misappropriation of funds. So, in mid-2017, the ministry had instituted a three-member inquiry committee to probe some allegations of misuse of finances against Setty. Later, this order was withdrawn on 16 August 2017. The Delhi high court, which has been hearing a PIL alleging misappropriation of funds at the national arts body, had sought an explanation from the ministry on 24 August 2017, about it. However, the ministry hasn't replied. The next date of hearing of the case was 8 May. So, the ministry finally decided to let Setty go in the first week of April 2018, after the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), in 2017, took note of repeated complaints, including missing artworks of the celebrated painter M.F. Husain from the Akademi. But in a reply to a newspaper, He said, \"M.F. Husain\u2019s work disappeared (from the Lalit Kala Akademi) long ago.

He wrote ''[[Himnusz]]'', the national anthem of Hungary in 1823.\n\n== Biography ==\nK\u00f6lcsey was born in [[Sz\u0151demeter]], [[Hungary]] (now [[S\u0103uca]], [[Romania]]). He was [[orphan]]ed at an early age and handicapped by the loss of an eye to [[smallpox]]. At age fifteen, he made the acquaintance of [[Ferenc Kazinczy]] and adopted his linguistic reforms. In 1809 K\u00f6lcsey went to [[Pest (city)|Pest]] and became a [[notary]] to the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Royal]] board. He was disenchanted with the office, and, while in [[Szatm\u00e1rcseke]], he devoted his time to aesthetical study, [[poetry]], criticism, and the defense of Kazinczy's theories.\n\nK\u00f6lcsey's early metrical pieces contributed to the ''Transylvanian Museum'' did not attract much attention, while his severe criticisms of [[Mih\u00e1ly Csokonai Vit\u00e9z]], [[J\u00e1nos Kis]], and especially [[D\u00e1niel Berzsenyi]], published in 1817, rendered him very unpopular. From 1821 to 1826 he published many separate poems of great beauty in the ''Aurora, Hebe, Aspasia'', and other magazines of polite [[literature]]. He joined [[P\u00e1l Szemere]] in a new periodical, styled ''\u00c9let \u00e9s Literat\u00fara'' (''Life and Literature''), which appeared from 1826 to 1829, in 4 vols., and gained for K\u00f6lcsey the highest reputation as a critical writer.\n\nFrom 1832 to 1835 he sat in the [[Diet of Hungary|Hungarian Diet]], where his extreme [[Classical liberalism|liberal]] views and his eloquence soon rendered him famous as a [[parliament]]ary leader. Elected on 17 November 1830 a member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]], he took part in its first grand meeting; in 1832, he delivered his famous oration on Kazinczy, and in 1836 that on his former opponent D\u00e1niel Berzsenyi. In 1838, when the opposition leader [[Mikl\u00f3s Wessel\u00e9nyi]] was thrown into prison upon a disputed charge of [[treason]], K\u00f6lcsey conducted his defense with noted eloquence, but without success. He died about a week afterwards at Szatm\u00e1rcseke, from internal inflammation.\n\nK\u00f6lcsey's strong moral sense and deep devotion to his country are reflected in his poems, his often severe but masterly literary criticism, and his funeral orations and parliamentary speeches. His collected works, in 6 volumes, were published at Pest, 1840\u20131848, and his journal of the Diet of 1832\u20131836 appeared in 1848. The first collected edition of all his works appeared in 1886\u201387.\n\nA [[monument]] erected to the memory of K\u00f6lcsey was unveiled at [[Satu Mare|Szatm\u00e1rn\u00e9meti]] on 25 September 1864. His poem ''[[Himnusz]]'' (1823), evoking the glory of Hungary's past, became the [[national anthem]] of Hungary.\n\n== Famous works ==\n* ''Vanitatum Vanitas'' 1823.\n* ''Himnusz'' 1823.

He joined [[P\u00e1l Szemere]] in a new periodical, styled ''\u00c9let \u00e9s Literat\u00fara'' (''Life and Literature''), which appeared from 1826 to 1829, in 4 vols., and gained for K\u00f6lcsey the highest reputation as a critical writer.\n\nFrom 1832 to 1835 he sat in the [[Diet of Hungary|Hungarian Diet]], where his extreme [[Classical liberalism|liberal]] views and his eloquence soon rendered him famous as a [[parliament]]ary leader. Elected on 17 November 1830 a member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]], he took part in its first grand meeting; in 1832, he delivered his famous oration on Kazinczy, and in 1836 that on his former opponent D\u00e1niel Berzsenyi. In 1838, when the opposition leader [[Mikl\u00f3s Wessel\u00e9nyi]] was thrown into prison upon a disputed charge of [[treason]], K\u00f6lcsey conducted his defense with noted eloquence, but without success. He died about a week afterwards at Szatm\u00e1rcseke, from internal inflammation.\n\nK\u00f6lcsey's strong moral sense and deep devotion to his country are reflected in his poems, his often severe but masterly literary criticism, and his funeral orations and parliamentary speeches. His collected works, in 6 volumes, were published at Pest, 1840\u20131848, and his journal of the Diet of 1832\u20131836 appeared in 1848. The first collected edition of all his works appeared in 1886\u201387.\n\nA [[monument]] erected to the memory of K\u00f6lcsey was unveiled at [[Satu Mare|Szatm\u00e1rn\u00e9meti]] on 25 September 1864. His poem ''[[Himnusz]]'' (1823), evoking the glory of Hungary's past, became the [[national anthem]] of Hungary.\n\n== Famous works ==\n* ''Vanitatum Vanitas'' 1823.\n* ''Himnusz'' 1823.
