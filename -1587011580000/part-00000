It was the first home of the Art Museum of Toronto. Today, it is part of the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]]. The structure was built in 1817, making it the [[List of oldest buildings and structures in Toronto|12th oldest surviving building in Toronto and the oldest remaining brick house]]. It was built for [[D'Arcy Boulton (1785\u20131846)|D'Arcy Boulton]] (1785\u20131846), one of the town's leading citizens and part of the powerful Boulton family that played an important role in the [[Family Compact]]. Originally, it was considerably west of the city, but over time, the city grew and Boulton sold his considerable land holdings surrounding the manor at great profit.\n\nThe house was inherited by D'Arcy's son and Toronto mayor, [[William Henry Boulton]]. When he died in 1874, the house passed to his widow, Hariette Boulton. She remarried the prominent scholar [[Goldwin Smith]], and the couple lived in The Grange for the rest of their lives. Upon Goldwin's Smith's death in 1910, the couple bequeathed the building to the Art Museum of Toronto (now known as the Art Gallery of Ontario) and The Grange became the new home of the gallery. The building also served as the first home of the Ontario College of Art and Design, now [[OCAD University]]. Since the early 20th century, the Art Gallery of Ontario has been expanded a number of times and the original manor makes up only a small part of the structure.\n\nThe expanse of lawn to the south of the building, what is left of the grounds, is operated by the city as [[Grange Park (Toronto)|Grange Park]]. Also on the old grounds is St. George Church, which was founded by the Boultons and which burned down in 1956. Only the tower and original Sunday school building remain.\n\nIn 1970, The Grange was designated a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site of Canada]] in recognition of the house's significance to the [[history of Toronto]].<ref>[http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/lhn-nhs/det_E.asp?oqSID=0549&oqeName=The+Grange&oqfName=The+Grange The Grange]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of Canada</ref><ref>[http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=7529&pid=0 The Grange], National Register of Historic Places</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early history (1817\u20131910)===\nThe Grange was built in 1817 as the home of D'Arcy Boulton (1785\u20131846; son of [[G. D'Arcy Boulton]]), his wife, Sarah Anne, and their eight children. It was located on 100 acres (40 ha) of land that extended from Queen Street in the south to Bloor Street in the north and from Beverley Street east to McCaul Street. The north section of the property was sold to Bishop Strachan in 1828, to be used for the establishment of King\u2019s College, an Anglican university. Property to the south was donated in the 1830s and 1840s for St. George the Martyr Church and [[St. Patrick's Market]], both still in existence.\n\nSarah Anne Robinson was born in Lower Canada in 1789 to a [[United Empire Loyalists|loyalist]] family who had previously moved north from Virginia after the American Revolution. D\u2019Arcy Boulton, in contrast, immigrated to Canada in 1797 when he was 12 years old. The two met through Sara Anne\u2019s older brother Peter Robinson and settled at The Grange (so named for the Boulton family estate in Lincolnshire, England) in 1817.<ref name=\"House Guests\" />\n\nSarah Anne quickly established herself as a superior hostess and The Grange became a central site for the social and political happenings of early Toronto. Over the course of their lives, the Boultons had eight children. D\u2019Arcy Boulton made his living running a dry good store and obtaining three governments posts. He died in 1846 after a rough decade of family deaths, a cholera epidemic and financial strain. When D\u2019Arcy died, the house was left to Sarah Anne. She put the house and the land around it in trust for her daughter-in-law, Harriette, as a marriage settlement. Thus, the house was under Harriette\u2019s control and it was Harriette who bequeathed the house to the Art Museum of Toronto. The head of the household was now his eldest son, William Henry Boulton.<ref name=\"House Guests\" />\n[[File:Smith and friends.jpg|thumb|[[Goldwin Smith]] (centre foreground) at The Grange with friends. Smith lived on the property in the late 19th century]]\nOver the course of his life William was mayor of Toronto three times in 1845, 1846, 1847 and was a member of the [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada]].<ref name=\"House Guests\" /> In 1846, William married Harriette Mann Dixon from Boston, yet the couple never had any children. William, however, was fond of gambling and Harriette and her mother-in-law, Sarah Anne, spent much time trying to keep The Grange in Boulton hands.<ref name=\"House Guests\" /> William died in 1874, leaving Harriette as the sole owner of The Grange.\n\nIn 1875, Harriette married [[Goldwin Smith]], British scholar and political writer. Goldwin Smith was once [[regius professor of history]] at [[Oxford University]] and personal tutor to the [[Prince of Wales]]. However, he decided to settle in Toronto in 1871. Smith was a proud supporter of the arts in Toronto and founded journals and encouraged young artists to paint Canadian subjects.<ref name=\"House Guests\" /> The couple lived happily in The Grange until their deaths in 1909 (Harriette) and 1910 (Goldwin).\n\n===Re-purposing into an art gallery (1911\u2013present)===\n{{main|Art Gallery of Ontario}}\n[[File:People visiting the Grange.jpg|thumb|The Grange in 1910, shortly before it was transformed into an art museum]]\nBy the turn of the 20th century, it was decided that Toronto should have an art gallery, much like many other major cities at the time. By 1900, local artist George Reid was the president of the Ontario Society of Artists and was pushing for the creation of an art gallery. Between Reid and Edmund Walker (prominent banker and champion of the arts), a campaign was established to raise money for the gallery scheme. In 1902, the Smiths joined the cause and decided to bequeath The Grange as the first location of the Art Museum of Toronto. It wasn\u2019t until 1913 that the museum held its first exhibition, composed of Smith\u2019s own collection.<ref name=\"House Guests\" /> By 1966, The Art Museum of Toronto was renamed the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) and The Grange now sits on the south side of the larger AGO building.\n\nFrom the early days of the Art Museum of Toronto until the restoration of the 1960s, The Grange underwent a variety of changes, including electrification and the inclusion of an apartment for a live-in caretaker. In 1918 and 1926 respectively, additional gallery wings were added to the AGO and several rooms in The Grange were used as staff offices. A tea room was also established in the drawing room and breakfast parlour.\n\nBy the 1960s, the AGO was once again expanding, therefore forging a new path for The Grange. This was a time in Ontario of increased interest in heritage preservation and so the Junior Women's Committee raised $650 000 for a restoration project. This money was used to restore The Grange to how it would have looked in 1835. In 1970, The Grange was named a [[National Historic Site of Canada]].<ref name=\"House Guests\" /> Designated by the City of Toronto under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]'' by By-law 130-91<ref>[http://app.toronto.ca/HeritagePreservation/details.do?folderRsn=2435769&propertyRsn=666769 317 Dundas Street West], City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties</ref>\n\nToday, The Grange houses the Norma Ridley Members\u2019 Lounge and exhibit spaces. While it is no longer furnished as a historic house depicting the 1830s, it retains its historic roots and architectural integrity. Visitors to the AGO are free to enjoy The Grange and explore the exhibits, take a tour, and speak to a volunteer about The Grange history.\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:AGO Grange.jpg|thumb|The [[Art Gallery of Ontario]]'s five-storey main building situated behind The Grange, a two-storey [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]]-styled residence]]\nThe original house, designed by an unknown architect, was two storeys high, 60 by 40 feet (18&nbsp;m \u00d7&nbsp;12&nbsp;m) in area, with a low hipped roof containing a circular window. It is likely that the bricks were made on the property from the heavily clayed soil. The windows are double-hung with brick lintels and louvered wooden shutters. They are 12-over-12 sash on the main floor and 8-over-8 sash on the second. The front door has a moulded reveal and a semi-circular fanlight, with separate sidelights.  Originally, the gate of the building extended to Queen Street, however the gates have been crowded back to the head of John Street.  As was the custom at the time, The Grange was built in the middle of a hundred-acre park lot. It received the name \"The Grange\" after a family estate in England.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Peppiatt|first1=Liam|title=Chapter 19: A Sketch of The Grange|url=http://www.landmarksoftoronto.com/a-sketch-of-the-grange|website=Robertson's Landmarks of Toronto Revisited|access-date=2015-07-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180927125237/http://www.landmarksoftoronto.com/a-sketch-of-the-grange|archive-date=2018-09-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nReflecting a sense of Georgian balance, the front door opened onto a central hall with the dining room on the left and the drawing room on the right. At the back of the house and on the second floor were bedrooms for the family. There were also four large rooms in the attic, probably for the servants. The kitchen, food storage areas and scullery were in the basement.\n\nThe property saw two major expansions, with the first series of expansions occurring in the 1840s. Several additions were made to the house, possibly because there had been a fire (this is difficult to confirm). These changes included the enlargement of the drawing room; the elimination of three bedrooms to create a large second-floor assembly room; and an addition on the west end to house an office. William Boulton, who was mayor of Toronto four times and a Member of Parliament, might have needed such a space. The front hall was also enlarged and a new central staircase installed. The painted glass window depicting the family crest was also added. This crest is a [[canting arms|visual play on the name]] Boulton, as it shows a barrel pierced by an arrow, or ''bolt'', with a hogshead of wine or ''tun''. The family motto&nbsp;\u2014 ''\"Dux vitae ratio\"'' (\"The guide to life is reason\")&nbsp;\u2014 rests below the crest, always reminding the Boultons of their British ancestry.<ref name=\"House Guests\">[Charlotte Gray.

The house stood on raised ground with terraces, as it does today. Around it was a mix of open spaces, stands of trees and flower gardens. Behind the house were vegetable and fruit gardens and, farther north, an orchard. The front lawn of The Grange, now known as the Grange Park, was central to Grange activities. This was the site for many garden parties, church school picnics and even a royal visit.\n\nSeveral images of The Grange show a domed glass conservatory on the east side of the house, which would have been filled with plants readily available from catalogues. One 1827 catalogue advertised 79 varieties of apple among other fruit and ornamental trees, as well as a wide variety of shrubs, flowers and greenhouse plants. We know that there was an orchard house on the property growing peaches, nectarines and grapes. William Boulton won prizes at the 1844 Toronto Horticultural Society Show for geraniums, roses, greenhouse plants and pansies. The gardener, John Gray, named a geranium he developed ''[[Pelargonium]] boultonianum'' after the Boultons.\n\nWith the sale of the southern part of the property in the mid-19th century, a new entrance to The Grange was created, which included a lodge \u2014 home to William Chin, the butler, and his family. Other buildings included a stable, a root house, a tool house and a drive shed. Later in the century, cottages for married servants were also erected.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[http://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDMDC-PICTURES-R-246&R=DC-PICTURES-R-246 The Grange, 1909, from the Toronto Public Gallery]\n*[http://www.ago.net/grange Art Gallery of Ontario: The Grange]\n\n{{NHSC}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Grange}}\n[[Category:Houses in Toronto]]\n[[Category:Museums in Toronto]]\n[[Category:Historic house museums in Ontario]]\n[[Category:National Historic Sites in Ontario]]\n[[Category:Georgian architecture in Canada]]\n[[Category:Art Gallery of Ontario]]\n[[Category:Designated heritage properties in Ontario]]\n", "text_old": "{{more footnotes|date=December 2011}}\n{{Infobox historic site\n| name = The Grange\n| image = The Grange.JPG\n| caption = The Grange in 2005\n| coordinates = {{coord|43|39|11|N|79|23|33|W|region:CA-ON_type:landmark|display=inline,title}}\n| location = {{comma separated entries|1=|2=[[Toronto]]|3=[[Ontario]]}}\n| nearest_city = [[Toronto]]\n| beginning_label = Established\n| built = 1817\n| original_use = [[Manor house]]\n| current_use = A wing of the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]]\n| governing_body = Art Gallery of Ontario\n| designation1 = National Historic Site of Canada\n| designation1_date = 1970\n}}\n\n'''The Grange''' is a historic [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] manor in downtown [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]].

It is located to the north of the [[Waitemat\u0101 Harbour]], \n\n{{Convert|15|km|mi}} northwest of the Auckland city centre. The suburb is in the Albany ward, one of the thirteen administrative divisions of [[Auckland Council]].  One of the city's newest suburbs, it was until relatively recently a town in its own right, and still has a feeling of not being truly a part of the city, which lies predominantly to the southeast of it. Much of the land to the north of Albany is still semi-rural.\n\nThe [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] name for the area was Okahukura (literally, 'place of rainbows' or 'place of butterflies'). The town was originally known as Lucas Creek. By 1890 it was a fruit-growing area and in that year it was renamed 'Albany' after the fruit-growing district called [[Albany, Western Australia|'Albany' in Australia]], pronounced with a short 'a' as in ''Albert''.<ref>{{cite journal\n| title = Edge city\n| journal= New Zealand Geographic\n| issue= 37 \n| publisher = \n| date = 1998\n| url = https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/edge-city/\n| accessdate = 17 August 2017\n| first=Liz\n| last=Mahoney\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=History books offer 'definite' guidance on pronunciation of Albany |first=Amy |last=Baker |url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/national/95706530/History-books-offer-definite-guidance-on-pronunciation-of-Albany |newspaper=Stuff |date=22 August 2017 |accessdate=24 August 2017}}</ref> The name ''Albany'' derives from ''[[Alba]]'' (Gaelic for Scotland) and its Latinisation.\n\n==City planning==\nIn 2005, there were plans to turn a major swath of Albany into a planned mini-urban centre, described as a \"happy mix of businesses, hotels, shops, apartments, and entertainment (including) an environment of parks and lakes and of tree-lined streets, paths and cycleways linking to the new [[Albany Busway Station|park-and-ride bus station]] and the [[Northern Busway, Auckland|rapid-busway lanes]] along the Northern Motorway to downtown Auckland\", according to a newspaper report.<ref name=twsSEPxvx37>{{cite news\n| author = Wayne Thompson\n| title = Albany blueprint gets green light\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald\n| date = 25 Oct 2005\n| url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/commercial-construction/news/article.cfm?c_id=693&objectid=10351837\n| accessdate = 2009-09-15\n}}</ref> It would be home to 10,000 people.<ref name=twsSEPxvx37/> Authorities wanted sound-proofed apartments against outside noise.<ref name=twsSEPxvx37/> Initial plans called for hotels, library, municipal swimming pool as well as the headquarters for the North Shore City Council.<ref name=twsSEPxvx37/> In some respects, development has proceeded accordingly, but the 2008\u201309 economic downturn has blunted some of this activity.\n\n===Demographics===\nThe population was 3,057 in the 2013 Census, an increase of 888 from the 2006 Census.<ref name=twsSEPxvx01>{{NZ Quickstats2013|13255|Albany}}</ref> There were 1,092 occupied dwellings in Albany in 2013,<ref name=twsSEPxvx01 /> and demographic makeup was 73% European, 5% Maori, 2% Pacific peoples, 22% Asian, 3% Middle Eastern/Latin American/African, and 1% other.<ref name=twsSEPxvx01/> The median income of $32,600 was higher than for the Auckland Region of $29,600.<ref name=twsSEPxvx01/> Unemployment in Albany was 7.0%, lower than the Auckland average of 8.1%.<ref name=twsSEPxvx01/> 91% had internet access and 88% had cell phones.<ref name=twsSEPxvx01/> Cars were prevalent.<ref name=twsSEPxvx01/> A near majority (48%) were born overseas.<ref name=twsSEPxvx01/> Ethnically, in keeping with the wider North Shore, Albany was predominantly [[Pakeha]] and Asian, and had a relatively high proportion of recent migrants from both elsewhere in New Zealand and overseas.\n\n===Retail and commercial activity===\nAlbany has become, in some respects, a substantial shopping and retail zone within the northwestern Auckland area.\n\nThe area (the future 'Albany Town Centre') is fast-growing in terms of its population and the development of the built environment, following planning decisions and land sales made by central and local governments in the 1980s and 1990s. Through the 1990s industrial and retail areas were rapidly produced, predominantly owned and occupied by local and foreign corporate capital.

It is located to the north of the [[Waitemat\u0101 Harbour]], \n\n{{Convert|15|km|mi}} northwest of the Auckland city centre. The suburb is in the Albany ward, one of the thirteen administrative divisions of [[Auckland Council]].  One of the city's newest suburbs, it was until relatively recently a town in its own right, and still has a feeling of not being truly a part of the city, which lies predominantly to the southeast of it. Much of the land to the north of Albany is still semi-rural.\n\nThe [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] name for the area was Okahukura (literally, 'place of rainbows' or 'place of butterflies'). The town was originally known as Lucas Creek. By 1890 it was a fruit-growing area and in that year it was renamed 'Albany' after the fruit-growing district called [[Albany, Western Australia|'Albany' in Australia]], pronounced with a short 'a' as in ''Albert''.<ref>{{cite journal\n| title = Edge city\n| journal= New Zealand Geographic\n| issue= 37 \n| publisher = \n| date = 1998\n| url = https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/edge-city/\n| accessdate = 17 August 2017\n| first=Liz\n| last=Mahoney\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=History books offer 'definite' guidance on pronunciation of Albany |first=Amy |last=Baker |url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/national/95706530/History-books-offer-definite-guidance-on-pronunciation-of-Albany |newspaper=Stuff |date=22 August 2017 |accessdate=24 August 2017}}</ref> The name ''Albany'' derives from ''[[Alba]]'' (Gaelic for Scotland) and its Latinisation.\n\n==City planning==\nIn 2005, there were plans to turn a major swath of Albany into a planned mini-urban centre, described as a \"happy mix of businesses, hotels, shops, apartments, and entertainment (including) an environment of parks and lakes and of tree-lined streets, paths and cycleways linking to the new [[Albany Busway Station|park-and-ride bus station]] and the [[Northern Busway, Auckland|rapid-busway lanes]] along the Northern Motorway to downtown Auckland\", according to a newspaper report.<ref name=twsSEPxvx37>{{cite news\n| author = Wayne Thompson\n| title = Albany blueprint gets green light\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald\n| date = 25 Oct 2005\n| url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/commercial-construction/news/article.cfm?c_id=693&objectid=10351837\n| accessdate = 2009-09-15\n}}</ref> It would be home to 10,000 people.<ref name=twsSEPxvx37/> Authorities wanted sound-proofed apartments against outside noise.<ref name=twsSEPxvx37/> Initial plans called for hotels, library, municipal swimming pool as well as the headquarters for the North Shore City Council.<ref name=twsSEPxvx37/> In some respects, development has proceeded accordingly, but the 2008\u201309 economic downturn has blunted some of this activity.\n\n===Demographics===\nThe population was 3,057 in the 2013 Census, an increase of 888 from the 2006 Census.<ref name=twsSEPxvx01>{{NZ Quickstats2013|13255|Albany}}</ref> There were 1,092 occupied dwellings in Albany in 2013,<ref name=twsSEPxvx01 /> and demographic makeup was 73% European, 5% Maori, 2% Pacific peoples, 22% Asian, 3% Middle Eastern/Latin American/African, and 1% other.<ref name=twsSEPxvx01/> The median income of $32,600 was higher than for the Auckland Region of $29,600.<ref name=twsSEPxvx01/> Unemployment in Albany was 7.0%, lower than the Auckland average of 8.1%.<ref name=twsSEPxvx01/> 91% had internet access and 88% had cell phones.<ref name=twsSEPxvx01/> Cars were prevalent.<ref name=twsSEPxvx01/> A near majority (48%) were born overseas.<ref name=twsSEPxvx01/> Ethnically, in keeping with the wider North Shore, Albany was predominantly [[Pakeha]] and Asian, and had a relatively high proportion of recent migrants from both elsewhere in New Zealand and overseas.\n\n===Retail and commercial activity===\nAlbany has become, in some respects, a substantial shopping and retail zone within the northwestern Auckland area.\n\nThe area (the future 'Albany Town Centre') is fast-growing in terms of its population and the development of the built environment, following planning decisions and land sales made by central and local governments in the 1980s and 1990s. Through the 1990s industrial and retail areas were rapidly produced, predominantly owned and occupied by local and foreign corporate capital. A major [[Shopping mall|shopping centre]] hub was opened in the late 1990s and has since expanded, with [[Westfield Albany]] becoming New Zealand's largest shopping centre.

{"title_page": "Beyond the Stellar Empire (play-by-mail game)", "text_new": "{{short description|Fantasy role-playing game}}\n{{Italic title}}\n'''''Beyond the Stellar Empire''''' (or '''''BSE''''') was a [[play-by-mail]] (PBM) game published by Adventures By Mail. ''BSE'' was an [[Open-ended (gameplay)|open-ended]] \"space opera\" with a single available game that began in playtesting in 1981.<ref>[[#Mar87|Marte 1987]]. p. 6.</ref> According to Stephen Marte, like \"[[The Tribes of Crane|Tribes of Crane]] and [[Midgard (game)|Midgard]], BSE is the stomping ground of many of PBM's best power gamers\".<ref>[[#Mar87|Marte 1987]]. p. 6., Marte bolded Tribes of Crane, Midgard, and BSE in the original text.</ref> The game comprised two variants, one monitored by Game Masters who imposed artificial constraints, and another without constraints. Gameplay took place on a vast space stage where [[mega-corporation]]s formed the dominant organizing framework, alongside various other groups that players could join to pursue tasks to advance, collaborate with other players, and progress to more senior positions such as colony governors. ''Beyond the Stellar Empire'' placed #5 and #11 in 1987 and 1988, respectively, in ''[[Paper Mayhem]]'', a magazine for play-by-mail games, for Best PBM Game of the Year. In subsequent years, the game did not score well in ''Paper Mayhem'' reader ratings for playability, use, and product understanding. ''Beyond the Stellar Empire: The New System'' won the [[Origins Award]] for Best New Play-By-Mail Game of 1989.\n\n==Development==\nReviewer Stephen Marte stated in 1987 that he had contact information for 150 PBM players but speculated that as many as 450 actually played the game.<ref>[[#Mui13|Muir 2013]]. p. 14.</ref>\n\nIn the January/February 1990 issue of ''[[Paper Mayhem]]'', a magazine for [[Play-by-mail game|play-by-mail games]], Mike Popolizio, Liz Leblanc, and Marti Popolizio described a redesign conducted on ''BSE''.<ref name=Poplizio>[[#Pop90|Popolizio, Leblanc, and Popolizio1990]]. p. 8\u201310.</ref> The overhaul included faster turnaround times for turns, additional options for diplomacy, increased ability to implement player suggestions, introduction of black-markets, and other changes.<ref name=Poplizio/> \n\nIn a 1992 issue of ''Paper Mayhem'', Wayne Alexander identified two variants of ''Beyond the Stellar Empire'': the Capellan Periphery and the Draconian Variant.<ref>[[#Ale92|Alexander 1992]]. p. 31.</ref> Alexander noted that the Capellan Periphery was the initial variant and was open-ended in the sense that it had no victory conditions\u2013players could continue to progress through work and expenditures, requesting and completing assignments, acquiring larger ships and colonies, etc.<ref>[[#Ale92|Alexander 1992]]. p. 31.</ref> However, he lamented that the Capellan Periphery was not truly open-ended in that the Game Masters (GMs) eventually would impose an artificial constraint on play that he called \"The Wall\".<ref>[[#Ale92|Alexander 1992]]. p. 31.</ref> This didn't prevent the players from having an enjoyable playing experience, but it limited \"power players\".<ref>[[#Ale92|Alexander 1992]]. p. 31.</ref> In other words, according to Alexander, \"The Capellan Periphery has a lot of sizzle, but the steak is just dog meat.\"<ref>[[#Ale92|Alexander 1992]]. p. 31.</ref> The Draconian Variant, while nascent in 1992, and saddled with some minor gameplay challenges, put players on the \"ground floor\" of a truly open-ended game, causing Alexander to describe it as one \"with very little sizzle at this point, but the steak is filet mignon in potential\".<ref>[[#Ale92|Alexander 1992]]. p. 31.</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe game took place on a vast space stage. Stephen Marte stated the following about the field of play in 1987: <blockquote>The playing field consists of 80 systems. Each system is 30X30 hexes and each hex is 46,000 square miles. Five hundred planets, moons, and gas giants have been found in the 52 systems of the Capellan Periphery and it is estimated there are another 500 worlds in the 38 systems of the less explored Transhole Region.

''BSE'' was an [[Open-ended (gameplay)|open-ended]] \"space opera\" with a single available game that began in playtesting in 1981.<ref>[[#Mar87|Marte 1987]]. p. 6.</ref> According to Stephen Marte, like \"[[The Tribes of Crane|Tribes of Crane]] and [[Midgard (game)|Midgard]], BSE is the stomping ground of many of PBM's best power gamers\".<ref>[[#Mar87|Marte 1987]]. p. 6., Marte bolded Tribes of Crane, Midgard, and BSE in the original text.</ref> The game comprised two variants, one monitored by Game Masters who imposed artificial constraints, and another without constraints. Gameplay took place on a vast space stage where [[mega-corporation]]s formed the dominant organizing framework, alongside various other groups that players could join to pursue tasks to advance, collaborate with other players, and progress to more senior positions such as colony governors. ''Beyond the Stellar Empire'' placed #5 and #11 in 1987 and 1988, respectively, in ''[[Paper Mayhem]]'', a magazine for play-by-mail games, for Best PBM Game of the Year. In subsequent years, the game did not score well in ''Paper Mayhem'' reader ratings for playability, use, and product understanding. ''Beyond the Stellar Empire: The New System'' won the [[Origins Award]] for Best New Play-By-Mail Game of 1989.\n\n==Development==\nReviewer Stephen Marte stated in 1987 that he had contact information for 150 PBM players but speculated that as many as 450 actually played the game.<ref>[[#Mui13|Muir 2013]]. p. 14.</ref>\n\nIn the January/February 1990 issue of ''[[Paper Mayhem]]'', a magazine for [[Play-by-mail game|play-by-mail games]], Mike Popolizio, Liz Leblanc, and Marti Popolizio described a redesign conducted on ''BSE''.<ref name=Poplizio>[[#Pop90|Popolizio, Leblanc, and Popolizio1990]]. p. 8\u201310.</ref> The overhaul included faster turnaround times for turns, additional options for diplomacy, increased ability to implement player suggestions, introduction of black-markets, and other changes.<ref name=Poplizio/> \n\nIn a 1992 issue of ''Paper Mayhem'', Wayne Alexander identified two variants of ''Beyond the Stellar Empire'': the Capellan Periphery and the Draconian Variant.<ref>[[#Ale92|Alexander 1992]]. p. 31.</ref> Alexander noted that the Capellan Periphery was the initial variant and was open-ended in the sense that it had no victory conditions\u2013players could continue to progress through work and expenditures, requesting and completing assignments, acquiring larger ships and colonies, etc.<ref>[[#Ale92|Alexander 1992]]. p. 31.</ref> However, he lamented that the Capellan Periphery was not truly open-ended in that the Game Masters (GMs) eventually would impose an artificial constraint on play that he called \"The Wall\".<ref>[[#Ale92|Alexander 1992]]. p. 31.</ref> This didn't prevent the players from having an enjoyable playing experience, but it limited \"power players\".<ref>[[#Ale92|Alexander 1992]]. p. 31.</ref> In other words, according to Alexander, \"The Capellan Periphery has a lot of sizzle, but the steak is just dog meat.\"<ref>[[#Ale92|Alexander 1992]]. p. 31.</ref> The Draconian Variant, while nascent in 1992, and saddled with some minor gameplay challenges, put players on the \"ground floor\" of a truly open-ended game, causing Alexander to describe it as one \"with very little sizzle at this point, but the steak is filet mignon in potential\".<ref>[[#Ale92|Alexander 1992]]. p. 31.</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe game took place on a vast space stage. Stephen Marte stated the following about the field of play in 1987: <blockquote>The playing field consists of 80 systems. Each system is 30X30 hexes and each hex is 46,000 square miles. Five hundred planets, moons, and gas giants have been found in the 52 systems of the Capellan Periphery and it is estimated there are another 500 worlds in the 38 systems of the less explored Transhole Region. Planets and moons may be mapped, scanned, and geologically proved down to a 10 square mile sector.

Modifications were made to the building to be more adequately equipped for postal delivery, after it was altered by the Department of National Defence. After the work was completed in 1948, the building now possessed the capability and equipment for proper mail sorting and other mailing functions. The building was strategically located south of Union Station and was connected directly to the train platforms via an underground tunnel. Trains would be able to directly unload mail and move it directly to the mail sorting centre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tayloronhistory.com/2013/02/12/torontos-architectural-gemsthe-postal-delivery-building-now-the-acc/|title=History|language=en|access-date=April 16, 2020}}</ref>  \n\n====1990s Transition to Stadium====\nIn the early 1990s, the building needed major renovations. To cut costs, Canada Post decided to close the facility and move operations to an alternate letter processing plant, which had been constructed in the 1970s on Eastern Avenue.  Eventually, all of the old building's work was transferred here.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the early 1990s, real estate developers [[Bramalea (company)|Bramalea Ltd]] and [[Trizec Properties|Trizec]] arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post, and redevelop the site into a {{convert|230,000|m2|sqft|adj=on}} office, retail and residential space.

In 1995, it had been decided that the NBA would expand into Canada. The Toronto Raptors were created and would need an indoor arena to play in. The Canada Post building was chosen to be the new home of the Raptors due to its downtown location and lot size. Other venues such as [[Exhibition Place]], North York Centre, Bay and Wellesley, and Bay and Dundas were also considered.

The original building is protected under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.\n\n===Arena 'Wars'===\nWhen MLGL ([[Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment|Maple Leaf Gardens, Limited]] at the time the controlling company of the Toronto Maple Leafs) lost out on their desire to be the franchise owners of the Raptors, competition between the two organizations heated up centred around venues. MLGL declined to allow Maple Leaf Gardens to be used for the NBA upstart as a result pushing Bitove to secure rights to have the Raptors' opening seasons played at SkyDome until construction of the new stadium to be complete.\n\nThe 1930s-era Maple Leaf Gardens was showing its age; the Maple Leafs in desperate desire for a new facility began developing plans for building an all-new stadium with one of the key criteria for the new location that it must be within close walking proximity to both the subway system and GO Transit. During the early stages of construction, MLGL floated to the media plans for their own plans to build a competing single-use stadium on adjacent property just to the north of the stadium atop the train sheds at Union Station (similar to how [[Madison Square Garden]] was constructed) as the new home for the Toronto Maple Leafs.<ref name=ArenaWars>{{cite news|title=Leafs ready to Move (Page 2)|first=Craig|last=Daniels|date=April 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Toronto Sun]]}}</ref> The reaction from Raptors was nothing but anger. \"This proposed (Maple Leaf) location really disturbs us\" stated team president Richard Peddie, who went on to say that they would fight the Leafs \"every step of the way\" and he didn't understand why the Leafs have refused to join with the Raptors at their site; claiming that the Leafs want to \"build virtually on top of us\".<ref name=\"ArenaWars\" /> The major problem of the Union Station proposal is the land that the stadium would be built on was actually City of Toronto land that was leased out to CN Rail and CP Rail, which were in a major, long-standing dispute over rent payments (dating back to 1969). As a result, MLGL offered the city $156 Million (1997 CAD) in cash & assets to settle any and all outstanding claims and to buy the air rights above the Union Station train platforms.\n\nDuring this period John Bitove who disputed over the future of the arena who as a result of a [[shotgun clause]] was forced to sell his stake to Allan Slaight (who wanted a joint arena deal with MLGL) and now with majority ownership immediately went into talks with MLGL which eventually purchased both the Raptors and their partially completed arena, which subsequently resulted in major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217&nbsp;million, MLGL increased the budget to $265&nbsp;million after taking control.<ref name=cost>{{cite news|title=Upgrades added to cost|first=David|last=Shoalts|date=February 17, 1999|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> The Raptors were twice fined a million dollars (which were donated to their charitable foundation) by the NBA for missing deadlines to begin construction of their new arena.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors' arena bites dust|last=Christe|first=James|date=May 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, a strange twist of scheduling conflicts had the Toronto Raptors playing their final regular-season game at [[Copps Coliseum]] in Hamilton, as the Toronto Blue Jays had first right of refusal for all SkyDome dates.

Dolphin]]). The Canada Post building was built in 1938, to assist in the recent population growth of Toronto and its surrounding area.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotiabankarena.com/venue-information/about/history|title=History {{!}} Scotiabank Arena|last=Arena|first=Scotiabank|website=www.scotiabankarena.com|language=en|access-date=November 15, 2018}}</ref> The building was handed over to Department of National Defence for war storage purposes upon completion in 1941, but returned to Canada Post in 1946. Modifications were made to the building to be more adequately equipped for postal delivery, after it was altered by the Department of National Defence. After the work was completed in 1948, the building now possessed the capability and equipment for proper mail sorting and other mailing functions. The building was strategically located south of Union Station and was connected directly to the train platforms via an underground tunnel. Trains would be able to directly unload mail and move it directly to the mail sorting centre.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://tayloronhistory.com/2013/02/12/torontos-architectural-gemsthe-postal-delivery-building-now-the-acc/|title=History|language=en|access-date=April 16, 2020}}</ref>  \n\n====1990s Transition to Stadium====\nIn the early 1990s, the building needed major renovations. To cut costs, Canada Post decided to close the facility and move operations to an alternate letter processing plant, which had been constructed in the 1970s on Eastern Avenue.  Eventually, all of the old building's work was transferred here.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the early 1990s, real estate developers [[Bramalea (company)|Bramalea Ltd]] and [[Trizec Properties|Trizec]] arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post, and redevelop the site into a {{convert|230,000|m2|sqft|adj=on}} office, retail and residential space. Financial and development details of the purchase imposed various conditions prior to development, including rezoning by the city, remediation of soil contamination by Canada Post.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bramalea's Moves Shake Taxpayers|first=Stevie|last=Cameron|date=November 15, 1992|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\nDue to financial difficulties, the building's ownership was returned to Canada Post in 1993. The Toronto Raptors purchased the building from Canada Post the next year.<ref name=\"rapnba\">{{cite web| url=http://www.nba.com/raptors/history/raptors_history.html/| title=Laying the Groundwork for the NBA in Toronto| website=nba.com| accessdate=October 14, 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Postal terminal now Air Canada Centre.jpg|thumb|left|The arena retains the eastern wall of the original postal structure built in 1941, through a process of [[facadism]].]]\nConstruction of the arena was started by the Toronto Raptors, under their initial ownership group headed by Canadian businessman [[John Bitove]]. In 1995, it had been decided that the NBA would expand into Canada. The Toronto Raptors were created and would need an indoor arena to play in. The Canada Post building was chosen to be the new home of the Raptors due to its downtown location and lot size. Other venues such as [[Exhibition Place]], North York Centre, Bay and Wellesley, and Bay and Dundas were also considered. The Canada Post building was purchased for {{CAD|60}} million.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Raptors initially played in SkyDome (now [[Rogers Centre]]) while the arena was constructed.<ref name=\"blogTo\">{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Bateman|title=That time the Raptors and the Maple Leafs moved to the ACC|url=http://www.blogto.com/city/2014/02/that_time_the_raptors_and_leafs_moved_to_the_acc/|website=blogTo|date=February 22, 2014|accessdate=December 4, 2017}}</ref> Groundbreaking took place in March 1997. The building retained the [[Art Deco]] facade of the Toronto Postal Delivery Building along the east (along [[Bay Street]]) and south ([[Lake Shore Boulevard]]) walls of that structure, but the rest of the building (facing [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]]) was removed to make room for the arena, through the process of [[facadism]]. The original building is protected under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.\n\n===Arena 'Wars'===\nWhen MLGL ([[Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment|Maple Leaf Gardens, Limited]] at the time the controlling company of the Toronto Maple Leafs) lost out on their desire to be the franchise owners of the Raptors, competition between the two organizations heated up centred around venues. MLGL declined to allow Maple Leaf Gardens to be used for the NBA upstart as a result pushing Bitove to secure rights to have the Raptors' opening seasons played at SkyDome until construction of the new stadium to be complete.\n\nThe 1930s-era Maple Leaf Gardens was showing its age; the Maple Leafs in desperate desire for a new facility began developing plans for building an all-new stadium with one of the key criteria for the new location that it must be within close walking proximity to both the subway system and GO Transit. During the early stages of construction, MLGL floated to the media plans for their own plans to build a competing single-use stadium on adjacent property just to the north of the stadium atop the train sheds at Union Station (similar to how [[Madison Square Garden]] was constructed) as the new home for the Toronto Maple Leafs.<ref name=ArenaWars>{{cite news|title=Leafs ready to Move (Page 2)|first=Craig|last=Daniels|date=April 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Toronto Sun]]}}</ref> The reaction from Raptors was nothing but anger. \"This proposed (Maple Leaf) location really disturbs us\" stated team president Richard Peddie, who went on to say that they would fight the Leafs \"every step of the way\" and he didn't understand why the Leafs have refused to join with the Raptors at their site; claiming that the Leafs want to \"build virtually on top of us\".<ref name=\"ArenaWars\" /> The major problem of the Union Station proposal is the land that the stadium would be built on was actually City of Toronto land that was leased out to CN Rail and CP Rail, which were in a major, long-standing dispute over rent payments (dating back to 1969). As a result, MLGL offered the city $156 Million (1997 CAD) in cash & assets to settle any and all outstanding claims and to buy the air rights above the Union Station train platforms.\n\nDuring this period John Bitove who disputed over the future of the arena who as a result of a [[shotgun clause]] was forced to sell his stake to Allan Slaight (who wanted a joint arena deal with MLGL) and now with majority ownership immediately went into talks with MLGL which eventually purchased both the Raptors and their partially completed arena, which subsequently resulted in major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217&nbsp;million, MLGL increased the budget to $265&nbsp;million after taking control.<ref name=cost>{{cite news|title=Upgrades added to cost|first=David|last=Shoalts|date=February 17, 1999|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> The Raptors were twice fined a million dollars (which were donated to their charitable foundation) by the NBA for missing deadlines to begin construction of their new arena.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors' arena bites dust|last=Christe|first=James|date=May 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, a strange twist of scheduling conflicts had the Toronto Raptors playing their final regular-season game at [[Copps Coliseum]] in Hamilton, as the Toronto Blue Jays had first right of refusal for all SkyDome dates.

This boosted Toronto's economy and led to further construction in the downtown core. Many projects in the area were completed ahead of schedule as a result of a desire to increase the infrastructure of downtown Toronto, and also from private funding (approximately $13&nbsp;million) that was invested in seeing the economic growth of Toronto.

Louisiana slowly developed, over millions of years, from water into land, and from north to south.<ref name=\"Keddy 2008\" /> The oldest rocks are exposed in the north, in areas such as the [[Kisatchie National Forest]]. The oldest rocks date back to the early [[Cenozoic Era]], some 60 million years ago. The history of the formation of these rocks can be found in D.

In general, the northern terraces have had sufficient time for rivers to cut deep channels, while the newer terraces tend to be much flatter.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Holland |first=W.C. |date=1944 |title=Physiographic divisions of the Quaternary lowlands of Louisiana |journal=Proceedings of the Louisiana Academy of Sciences |volume=8 |pages=10\u201324 }}</ref>\n\n[[Salt dome]]s are also found in Louisiana.

The alluvial region includes low swamp lands, coastal marshlands and beaches, and [[barrier islands]] that cover about {{convert|20000|sqmi|km2}}. This area lies principally along the Gulf of Mexico and the [[Mississippi River]], which traverses the state from north to south for a distance of about {{convert|600|mi|-1|abbr=on}} and empties into the Gulf of Mexico; the [[Red River of the South|Red River]]; the [[Ouachita River]] and its branches; and other minor streams (some of which are called [[bayous]]).\n\nThe breadth of the alluvial region along the Mississippi is from 10 to 60 miles (15 to 100&nbsp;km), and along the other rivers, the alluvial region averages about 10 miles (15&nbsp;km) across. The Mississippi River flows along a ridge formed by its natural deposits (known as a [[levee]]), from which the lands decline toward a river beyond at an average fall of six feet per mile (3&nbsp;m/km). The alluvial lands along other streams present similar features.\n\nThe higher and contiguous hill lands of the north and northwestern part of the state have an area of more than {{convert|25000|sqmi|km2}}. They consist of prairie and woodlands. The elevations above sea level range from 10 feet (3&nbsp;m) at the coast and swamp lands to 50 and 60 feet (15\u201318&nbsp;m) at the prairie and alluvial lands. In the uplands and hills, the elevations rise to [[Driskill Mountain]], the highest point in the state only 535 feet (163&nbsp;m) above sea level. From 1932 to 2010 the state lost 1,800 square miles due to rises in sea level and [[erosion]]. The [[Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority]] (CPRA) spends around $1&nbsp;billion per year to help shore up and protect Louisiana [[shore]]line and land in both federal and state funding.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21727099-has-lessons-americas-climate-change-policy-louisiana-fights-sea-and-loses|title=Louisiana fights the sea, and loses|website=The Economist|access-date=August 28, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828163535/https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21727099-has-lessons-americas-climate-change-policy-louisiana-fights-sea-and-loses|archive-date=August 28, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBesides the waterways already named, there are the [[Sabine River (Texas-Louisiana)|Sabine]], forming the western boundary; and the [[Pearl River (Mississippi-Louisiana)|Pearl]], the eastern boundary; the [[Calcasieu River|Calcasieu]], the [[Mermentau River|Mermentau]], the [[Vermilion River (Louisiana)|Vermilion]], [[Bayou Teche]], the [[Atchafalaya River|Atchafalaya]], the [[Boeuf River|Boeuf]], [[Bayou Lafourche]], the Courtableau River, Bayou D'Arbonne, the Macon River, the [[Tensas River|Tensas]], [[Amite River]], the [[Tchefuncte River|Tchefuncte]], the [[Tickfaw River|Tickfaw]], the [[Natalbany River]], and a number of other smaller streams, constituting a natural system of navigable waterways, aggregating over {{convert|4000|mi|km}} long.\n\nThe state also has political jurisdiction over the approximately {{convert|3|mi|km|adj=on}}-wide portion of [[subsea]] land of the [[Outer continental shelf|inner continental shelf]] in the Gulf of Mexico.

Swamps have been extensively logged, leaving canals and ditches that allow salt water to move inland. Canals dug for the oil and gas industry also allow storms to move sea water inland, where it damages swamps and marshes. Rising sea waters have exacerbated the problem. Some researchers estimate that the state is losing a landmass equivalent to 30 football fields every day. There are many proposals to save coastal areas by reducing human damage, including restoring natural floods from the Mississippi. Without such restoration, coastal communities will continue to disappear.<ref>Boesch, D. F., Josselyn, M. N., Mehta, A. J., Morris, J. T., Nuttle, W. K., Simenstad, C. A., and Swift, D. P. J.

The subtropical characteristics of the state are due to its low latitude, low lying topography, and the influence of the [[Gulf of Mexico]], which at its farthest point is no more than {{convert|200|mi|-1|abbr=on}} away.\n\nRain is frequent throughout the year, although from April to September is slightly wetter than the rest of the year, which is the state's [[wet season]]. There is a dip in precipitation in October. In summer, thunderstorms build during the heat of the day and bring intense but brief, tropical downpours. In winter, rainfall is more frontal and less intense.\n\nSummers in southern Louisiana have high temperatures from June through September averaging 90&nbsp;\u00b0F (32&nbsp;\u00b0C) or more, and overnight lows averaging above 70&nbsp;\u00b0F (22&nbsp;\u00b0C). At times, temperatures in the 90s F, combined with [[dew points]] in the upper 70s F, create sensible temperatures over {{convert|120|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}. The humid, thick, jungle-like heat in southern Louisiana is a famous subject of countless stories and movies.\n\nTemperatures are generally warm in the winter in the southern part of the state, with highs around New Orleans, Baton Rouge, the rest of south Louisiana, and the Gulf of Mexico averaging 66&nbsp;\u00b0F (19&nbsp;\u00b0C). The northern part of the state is mildly cool in the winter, with highs averaging 59&nbsp;\u00b0F (15&nbsp;\u00b0C). The overnight lows in the winter average well above freezing throughout the state, with 46&nbsp;\u00b0F (8&nbsp;\u00b0C) the average near the Gulf and an average low of 37&nbsp;\u00b0F (3&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the winter in the northern part of the state.\n\nOn occasion, cold fronts from low-pressure centers to the north, reach Louisiana in winter. Low temperatures near 20&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u22128&nbsp;\u00b0C) occur on occasion in the northern part of the state but rarely do so in the southern part of the state. [[Snow in Louisiana|Snow]] is rare near the Gulf of Mexico, although residents in the northern parts of the state might receive a dusting of snow a few times each decade. Louisiana's highest recorded temperature is {{convert|114|F|C}} in [[Plain Dealing, Louisiana|Plain Dealing]] on August 10, 1936, while the coldest recorded temperature is {{convert|-16|F|C}} at [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]] on February 13, 1899.\n\nLouisiana is often affected by [[tropical cyclone]]s and is very vulnerable to strikes by major [[Atlantic hurricane|hurricanes]], particularly the lowlands around and in the New Orleans area. The unique geography of the region, with the many bayous, marshes and inlets, can result in water damage across a wide area from major hurricanes. The area is also prone to frequent thunderstorms, especially in the summer.<ref name=\"Annual average number of tornadoes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |title=NOAA National Climatic Data Center |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016174155/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |archive-date=October 16, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe entire state averages over 60 days of thunderstorms a year, more than any other state except Florida.

In 1542, [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]]'s expedition skirted to the north and west of the state (encountering Caddo and Tunica groups) and then followed the Mississippi River down to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in 1543.

With its first settlements, France laid claim to a vast region of North America and set out to establish a commercial empire and French nation stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada.\n\nIn 1682, the French explorer [[Robert Cavelier de La Salle]] named the region Louisiana to honor [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]] of France. The first permanent settlement, Fort Maurepas (at what is now [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi]], near [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]]), was founded in 1699 by [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]], a French military officer from Canada.

The French settlement had two purposes: to establish trade with the Spanish in [[Texas]] via the Old San Antonio Road, and to deter Spanish advances into Louisiana. The settlement soon became a flourishing river port and crossroads, giving rise to vast cotton kingdoms along the river that were worked by imported African slaves. Over time, planters developed large plantations and built fine homes in a growing town. This became a pattern repeated in New Orleans and other places, although the commodity crop in the south was primarily sugar cane.\n[[File:Atchafalaya Basin.jpg|thumb|French Acadians, who came to be known as [[Cajuns]], settled the swamps of southern Louisiana, especially in the [[Atchafalaya Basin]].]]\n\nLouisiana's French settlements contributed to further exploration and outposts, concentrated along the banks of the Mississippi and its major tributaries, from Louisiana to as far north as the region called the [[Illinois Country]], around present-day [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. The latter was settled by French colonists from Illinois.\n\nInitially, [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] and then [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]] served as the capital of La Louisiane. Recognizing the importance of the Mississippi River to trade and military interests, and wanting to protect the capital from severe coastal storms, France developed New Orleans from 1722 as the seat of civilian and military authority south of the Great Lakes. From then until the United States acquired the territory in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, France and Spain jockeyed for control of New Orleans and the lands west of the Mississippi.\n\nIn the 1720s, German immigrants settled along the Mississippi River, in a region referred to as the [[German Coast]].\n\nFrance ceded most of its territory to the east of the Mississippi to Great Britain in 1763, in the aftermath of [[Great Britain in the Seven Years War|Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War]] (generally referred to in North America as the [[French and Indian War]]). The rest of Louisiana, including the area around New Orleans and the parishes around [[Lake Pontchartrain]], had become a colony of Spain by the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]] (1762). The transfer of power on either side of the river would be delayed until later in the decade.\n\nIn 1765, during Spanish rule, several thousand French-speaking refugees from the region of [[Acadia]] (now [[Nova Scotia]], New Brunswick, and [[Prince Edward Island]], Canada) made their way to Louisiana after having been [[Expulsion of the Acadians|expelled]] from their homelands by the British during the French and Indian War. They settled chiefly in the southwestern Louisiana region now called [[Acadiana]]. The Spanish, eager to gain more Catholic settlers, welcomed the [[Acadian]] refugees, the ancestors of Louisiana's [[Cajun]]s.\n\nSpanish Canary Islanders, called [[Isle\u00f1os]], emigrated from the Canary Islands of Spain to Louisiana under the Spanish crown between 1778 and 1783.\n\nIn 1800, France's [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] reacquired Louisiana from Spain in the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso|Treaty of San Ildefonso]], an arrangement kept secret for two years.\n\n===Expansion of slavery===\n\n{{main|History of slavery in Louisiana}}\n\n[[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville]] brought the first two African slaves to Louisiana in 1708, transporting them from a French colony in the West Indies. In 1709, French financier [[Antoine Crozat]] obtained a monopoly of commerce in [[La Louisiane]], which extended from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to what is now [[Illinois]]. \"That concession allowed him to bring in a cargo of blacks from Africa every year,\" the British historian [[Hugh Thomas (writer)|Hugh Thomas]] wrote.<ref>''The Slave Trade: The Story of the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1440\u20131870'' by Hugh Thomas. 1997: Simon and Schuster. p. 242-43</ref> Physical conditions, including disease, were so harsh there was high mortality among both the colonists and the slaves, resulting in continuing demand and importation of slaves.\n\nStarting in 1719, traders began to import slaves in higher numbers; two French ships, the ''Du Maine'' and the ''Aurore'', arrived in New Orleans carrying more than 500 black slaves coming from Africa. Previous slaves in Louisiana had been transported from French colonies in the West Indies. By the end of 1721, New Orleans counted 1,256 inhabitants, of whom about half were slaves.\n\nIn 1724, the French government issued a law called the [[Code Noir]] (\"Black Code\" in English) which \"regulate[d] the interaction of whites [blancs] and blacks [noirs] in its colony of Louisiana<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.knowlouisiana.org/entry/code-noir-of-louisiana|title=Code Noir of Louisiana\u2014Know Louisiana|publisher=|access-date=April 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518041714/http://www.knowlouisiana.org/entry/code-noir-of-louisiana|archive-date=May 18, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> (which was much larger than the current state of Louisiana). The law consisted of 57 articles, which regulated religion in the colony, outlawed \"interracial\" marriages (those between people of different skin color, the varying shades of which were also defined by law), restricted [[manumission]], outlined legal punishment of slaves for various offenses, and defined some obligations of owners to their slaves. The main intent of the French government was to assert control over the slave system of agriculture in Louisiana and to impose restrictions on slaveowners there. In practice, the Code Noir was exceedingly difficult to enforce from afar. Some priests continued to perform interracial marriage ceremonies, for example, and some slaveholders continued to manumit slaves without permission while others punished slaves brutally.\n\nArticle II of the Code Noir of 1724 required owners to provide their slaves with religious education in the state religion, Roman Catholicism. Sunday was to be a day of rest for slaves. On days off, slaves were expected to feed and take care of themselves. During the 1740s economic crisis in the colony, owners had trouble feeding their slaves and themselves. Giving them time off also effectively gave more power to slaves, who started cultivating their own gardens and crafting items for sale as their own property. They began to participate in the economic development of the colony while at the same time increasing independence and self-subsistence.\n\nArticle VI of the Code Noir forbade mixed marriages, forbade but did little to protect slave women from rape by their owners, overseers or other slaves. On balance, the Code benefitted the owners but had more protections and flexibility than did the institution of slavery in the southern [[Thirteen Colonies]].\n\nThe Louisiana Black Code of 1806 made the cruel punishment of slaves a crime, but owners and overseers were seldom prosecuted for such acts.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=The law of slavery\u2014Master\u2013slave legal relationships |url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24164 |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007003400/http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24164 |archivedate=October 7, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nFugitive slaves, called maroons, could easily hide in the backcountry of the bayous and survive in small settlements. The word \"maroon\" comes from the Spanish \"cimarron\", meaning \"fugitive cattle\".\n\nIn the late 18th century, the last Spanish governor of the Louisiana territory wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Truly, it is impossible for lower Louisiana to get along without slaves and with the use of slaves, the colony had been making great strides toward prosperity and wealth.<ref name=\"The Slave Trade p. 548\"/></blockquote>\n\nWhen the United States [[Louisiana Purchase|purchased Louisiana]] in 1803, it was soon accepted that enslaved Africans could be brought to Louisiana as easily as they were brought to neighboring [[Mississippi]], though it violated U.S. law to do so.<ref name=\"The Slave Trade p. 548\">Hugh Thomas, ''The Slave Trade: The Story of the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1440\u20131870'', Simon and Schuster, 1997, p. 548.</ref> Despite demands by United States Rep. [[James Hillhouse]] and by the pamphleteer [[Thomas Paine]] to enforce existing federal law against slavery in the newly acquired territory,<ref name=\"The Slave Trade p. 548\" /> slavery prevailed because it was the source of great profits and the lowest-cost labor.\n\nAt the start of the 19th century, Louisiana was a small producer of sugar with a relatively small number of slaves, compared to Saint-Domingue and the West Indies. It soon thereafter became a major sugar producer as new settlers arrived to develop plantations. [[William C. C. Claiborne]], Louisiana's first United States governor, said African slave labor was needed because white laborers \"cannot be had in this unhealthy climate\".<ref>Thomas (1997), ''The Slave Trade'', p. 549.</ref> Hugh Thomas wrote that Claiborne was unable to enforce the abolition of the African slave trade, which the U.S. and Great Britain adopted in 1808. The United States continued to protect the domestic slave trade, including the coastwise trade\u2014the transport of slaves by ship along the Atlantic Coast and to New Orleans and other Gulf ports.\n\nBy 1840, New Orleans had the biggest slave market in the United States, which contributed greatly to the economy of the city and of the state. New Orleans had become one of the wealthiest cities, and the third largest city, in the nation.<ref>Walter Johnson, ''Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1999, p.2</ref> The ban on the African slave trade and importation of slaves had increased demand in the domestic market.

Many sold slaves to traders to take to the Deep South. Slaves were driven by traders overland from the Upper South or transported to New Orleans and other coastal markets by ship in the [[coastwise slave trade]]. After sales in New Orleans, steamboats operating on the Mississippi transported slaves upstream to markets or plantation destinations at Natchez and Memphis.\n\nAs the [[Deep South]] was developed for cotton and sugar in the first half of the nineteenth century, demand for slaves increased. This resulted in a massive forced migration (through the slave trade) of more than one million African Americans from the [[Upper South]] to the Deep South. Many traders brought slaves to New Orleans for domestic sale, and by 1840, New Orleans had the largest slave market in the country, was the third-largest city, and was one of the wealthiest cities.\n[[File:Free Woman of Color with daughter NOLA Collage.jpg|thumb|[[Free people of color|Free woman of color]] with [[mixed-race]] daughter; late 18th-century collage painting, New Orleans]]\n\n===Haitian migration and influence===\n\nSpanish occupation of Louisiana lasted from 1769 to 1800. Beginning in the 1790s, waves of immigration took place from [[Saint-Domingue]], following a [[Haitian Revolution|slave rebellion]] that started in 1791. Over the next decade, thousands of migrants landed in Louisiana from the island, including ethnic Europeans, [[free people of color]], and African slaves, some of the latter brought in by each free group. They greatly increased the French-speaking population in New Orleans and Louisiana, as well as the number of Africans, and the slaves reinforced African culture in the city. The process of gaining independence in Saint-Domingue was complex, but uprisings continued. In 1803, France pulled out its surviving troops from the island, having suffered the loss of two-thirds sent to the island two years before, mostly to [[yellow fever]].

As American settlers pushed west, they found that the [[Appalachian Mountains]] provided a barrier to shipping goods eastward. The easiest way to ship produce was to use a [[flatboat]] to float it down the [[Ohio river|Ohio]] and Mississippi Rivers to the port of New Orleans, where goods could be put on ocean-going vessels. The problem with this route was that the Spanish owned both sides of the Mississippi below [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]].\n\nNapoleon's ambitions in Louisiana involved the creation of a new empire centered on the [[Caribbean]] [[sugar trade]]. By the terms of the Treaty of Amiens of 1802, Great Britain returned ownership of the islands of [[Martinique]] and [[Guadaloupe]] to the French. Napoleon looked upon Louisiana as a depot for these sugar islands, and as a buffer to U.S. settlement. In October 1801 he sent a large military force to take back Saint-Domingue, then under control of Toussaint Louverture after a slave rebellion.\nWhen the army led by Napoleon's brother-in-law Leclerc was defeated, Napoleon decided to sell Louisiana.\n[[File:Louisiane 1800.png|thumb|Map of Louisiana in 1800]]\n\n[[Thomas Jefferson]], third president of the United States, was disturbed by Napoleon's plans to re-establish French colonies in America. With the possession of New Orleans, Napoleon could close the Mississippi to U.S. commerce at any time. Jefferson authorized [[Robert Livingston (1746\u20131813)|Robert R. Livingston]], U.S. Minister to France, to negotiate for the purchase of the City of New Orleans, portions of the east bank of the Mississippi, and free navigation of the river for U.S. commerce. Livingston was authorized to pay up to $2&nbsp;million.\n\nAn official transfer of Louisiana to French ownership had not yet taken place, and Napoleon's deal with the Spanish was a poorly kept secret on the frontier. On October 18, 1802, however, Juan Ventura Morales, Acting Intendant of Louisiana, made public the intention of Spain to revoke the right of deposit at New Orleans for all cargo from the United States. The closure of this vital port to the United States caused anger and consternation. Commerce in the west was virtually blockaded. Historians believe the revocation of the right of deposit was prompted by abuses by the Americans, particularly smuggling, and not by French intrigues as was believed at the time. President Jefferson ignored public pressure for war with France, and appointed [[James Monroe]] a special envoy to Napoleon, to assist in obtaining New Orleans for the United States. Jefferson also raised the authorized expenditure to $10&nbsp;million.\n\nHowever, on April 11, 1803, French Foreign Minister [[Talleyrand]] surprised Livingston by asking how much the United States was prepared to pay for the '''entirety''' of Louisiana, not just New Orleans and the surrounding area (as Livingston's instructions covered). Monroe agreed with Livingston that Napoleon might withdraw this offer at any time (leaving them with no ability to obtain the desired New Orleans area), and that approval from President Jefferson might take months, so Livingston and Monroe decided to open negotiations immediately. By April 30, they closed a deal for the purchase of the entire Louisiana territory of {{convert|828000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} for 60 million [[French franc|Francs]] (approximately $15&nbsp;million).\n\nPart of this sum, $3.5&nbsp;million, was used to forgive debts owed by France to the United States.<ref>Peter Kastor, ''The Nation's Crucible: The Louisiana Purchase and the Creation of America'', (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004) 40</ref> The payment was made in United States [[Government bond|bonds]], which Napoleon sold at face value to the Dutch firm of [[Hope & Co.|Hope and Company]], and the [[Barings Bank|British banking house of Baring]], at a discount of 87\u00bd per each $100 unit. As a result, France received only $8,831,250 in cash for Louisiana. English banker [[Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton|Alexander Baring]] conferred with Marbois in Paris, shuttled to the United States to pick up the bonds, took them to Britain, and returned to France with the money\u2014which Napoleon used to wage war against Baring's own country.\n[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - Louisiana Purchase, 1803.jpg|thumb|Louisiana Purchase, 1803]]\n\nWhen news of the purchase reached the United States, Jefferson was surprised. He had authorized the expenditure of $10&nbsp;million for a port city, and instead received treaties committing the government to spend $15&nbsp;million on a land package which would double the size of the country. Jefferson's political opponents in the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]] argued the Louisiana purchase was a worthless desert,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AsY9Vh9X8ZYC&dq=%22louisiana+purchase%22+federalist+desert+jefferson&q=worthless+desert |title=The American pageant: a history of the republic\u2014Thomas A.

What really worried the opposition was the new states which would inevitably be carved from the Louisiana territory, strengthening Western and Southern interests in Congress, and further reducing the influence of New England Federalists in national affairs. President Jefferson was an enthusiastic supporter of westward expansion, and held firm in his support for the treaty. Despite Federalist objections, the U.S. Senate ratified the Louisiana treaty on October 20, 1803.\n\nBy statute enacted on October 31, 1803, President Thomas Jefferson was authorized to take possession of the territories ceded by France and provide for initial governance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002/llsl002.db&recNum=282|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774\u20131875|website=memory.loc.gov|access-date=December 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220085715/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002%2Fllsl002.db&recNum=282|archive-date=December 20, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> A transfer ceremony was held in New Orleans on November 29, 1803. Since the Louisiana territory had never officially been turned over to the French, the Spanish took down their flag, and the French raised theirs. The following day, [[General James Wilkinson]] accepted possession of New Orleans for the United States. A similar ceremony was held in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] on March 9, 1804, when a French tricolor was raised near the river, replacing the Spanish national flag. The following day, [[Captain (U.S. Army)|Captain]] [[Amos Stoddard]] of the First U.S. Artillery marched his troops into town and had the American flag run up the fort's flagpole. The Louisiana territory was officially transferred to the United States government, represented by [[Meriwether Lewis]].\n\nThe Louisiana Territory, purchased for less than three cents an acre, doubled the size of the United States overnight, without a war or the loss of a single American life, and set a precedent for the purchase of territory. It opened the way for the eventual expansion of the United States across the continent to the Pacific.\n\nShortly after the United States took possession, the area was divided into two territories along the [[33rd parallel north]] on March 26, 1804, thereby organizing the [[Territory of Orleans]] to the south and the [[District of Louisiana]] (subsequently formed as the [[Louisiana Territory]]) to the north.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002/llsl002.db&recNum=320|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774\u20131875|website=rs6.loc.gov|access-date=December 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220091706/http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002%2Fllsl002.db&recNum=320|archive-date=December 20, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Statehood (1812)===\n\n{{Main|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|Seminole Wars|Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty}}\n\nLouisiana became the eighteenth U.S. state on April 30, 1812; the Territory of Orleans became the State of Louisiana and the Louisiana Territory was simultaneously renamed the [[Missouri Territory]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002/llsl002.db&recNum=738|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774\u20131875|website=memory.loc.gov|access-date=December 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105021747/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002%2Fllsl002.db&recNum=738|archive-date=January 5, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> An area known as the [[Florida Parishes]] was soon annexed into the state of Louisiana on April 14, 1812.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002/llsl002.db&recNum=745|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774\u20131875|website=memory.loc.gov|access-date=December 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202191512/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002%2Fllsl002.db&recNum=745|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1824 to 1861, Louisiana moved from a political system based on personality and ethnicity to a distinct two-party system, with Democrats competing first against ''Whigs'', then ''Know Nothings'', and finally only other [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].<ref>John M.

Federal troops captured New Orleans on April 25, 1862. Because a large part of the population had Union sympathies (or compatible commercial interests), the federal government took the unusual step of designating the areas of Louisiana under federal control as a state within the Union, with its own elected representatives to the [[U.S. Congress]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n===Post-Civil War to mid-20th century (1865\u20131945)===\n\nFollowing the Civil War and emancipation of slaves, violence rose in the South as the war was carried on by insurgent private and paramilitary groups. Initially state legislatures were dominated by former Confederates, who passed Black Codes to regulate [[freedmen]] and generally refused to give the vote. They refused to extend voting rights to African Americans who had been free before the war and had sometimes obtained education and property (as in New Orleans.) Following the [[Memphis riots of 1866]] and the [[New Orleans riot]] the same year, the Fourteenth Amendment was passed that provided suffrage and full citizenship for freedmen. Congress passed the Reconstruction Act, establishing military districts for those states where conditions were considered the worst, including Louisiana. It was grouped with [[Texas]] in what was administered as the [[Fifth Military District]].\n\nAfrican Americans began to live as citizens with some measure of equality before the law. Both [[freedmen]] and [[free people of color|people of color]] who had been free before the war began to make more advances in education, family stability and jobs. At the same time, there was tremendous social volatility in the aftermath of war, with many whites actively resisting defeat and the free labor market. White [[insurgents]] mobilized to enforce [[white supremacy]], first in [[Ku Klux Klan]] chapters.\n\nBy 1877, when federal forces were withdrawn, white Democrats in Louisiana and other states had regained control of state legislatures, often by paramilitary groups such as the [[White League]], which suppressed black voting through intimidation and violence. Following Mississippi's example in 1890, in 1898, the white Democratic, planter-dominated legislature passed a new constitution that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] people of color, by raising barriers to voter registration, such as [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], residency requirements and [[literacy tests]]. The effect was immediate and long lasting. In 1896, there were 130,334 black voters on the rolls and about the same number of white voters, in proportion to the state population, which was evenly divided.<ref>{{Cite journal|ssrn=224731 |title=Richard H.

Protestants are concentrated in the northern and central parts of the state and in the northern tier of the [[Florida Parishes]]. Because of French and Spanish heritage, and their descendants the Creoles, and later Irish, Italian, Portuguese and German immigrants, southern Louisiana and the greater New Orleans area are predominantly Catholic.<ref>For Louisiana's position in a larger religious context, see [[Bible Belt]].</ref>\n\nSince Creoles were the first settlers, planters and leaders of the territory, they have traditionally been well represented in politics. For instance, most of the early governors were Creole Catholics.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Louisiana}}</ref> Because Catholics still constitute a significant fraction of Louisiana's population, they have continued to be influential in state politics. {{As of|2008}} both Senators and the governor were Catholic. The high proportion and influence of the Catholic population makes Louisiana distinct among Southern states.<ref>Other Southern states have longstanding indigenous Catholic populations, and Florida's largely Catholic population of Cuban emigres has been influential since the 1960s. Yet, Louisiana is still unusual or exceptional in its extent of aboriginal Catholic settlement and influence. Among states in the [[Deep South]] (discounting [[Florida Panhandle|Florida's Panhandle]] and much of Texas) the historic role of Catholicism in Louisiana is unparalleled and unique. Among the states of the Union, Louisiana's unique use of the term ''parish'' (French ''la parouche'' or \"la paroisse\") for ''county'' is rooted in the pre-statehood role of Catholic church parishes in the administration of government.</ref>\n\n[[Jewish]] communities are established in the state's larger cities, notably New Orleans and Baton Rouge.<ref>Isaacs, Ronald H.

Neighboring states and the amount of federal spending received per dollar of federal tax collected were: Texas ($0.94), Arkansas ($1.41), and Mississippi ($2.02).

Petroleum and gas deposits are found in abundance both onshore and offshore in State-owned waters. In addition, vast petroleum and natural gas reserves are found offshore from Louisiana in the federally administered [[Outer Continental Shelf]] (OCS) in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. According to the [[Energy Information Administration]], the Gulf of Mexico OCS is the largest U.S. petroleum-producing region. Excluding the Gulf of Mexico OCS, Louisiana ranks fourth in petroleum production and is home to about two percent of the total U.S. petroleum reserves.\n\nLouisiana's natural gas reserves account for about five percent of the U.S. total. The recent discovery of the [[Haynesville Shale]] formation in parts of or all of Caddo, Bossier, Bienville, Sabine, De Soto, Red River, and Natchitoches parishes have made it the world's fourth largest gas field with some wells initially producing over 25 million cubic feet of gas daily.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/state_energy_profiles.cfm?sid=LA |title=EIA State Energy Profiles: Louisiana |date=June 12, 2008 |accessdate=June 24, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206050811/http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/state_energy_profiles.cfm?sid=LA |archive-date=February 6, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nLouisiana was the first site of [[Oil well|petroleum drilling]] over water in the world, on [[Caddo Lake]] in the northwest corner of the state. The petroleum and gas industry, as well as its subsidiary industries such as transport and [[Oil refinery|refining]], have dominated Louisiana's economy since the 1940s. Beginning in 1950, Louisiana was sued several times by the [[United States Department of the Interior|U.S. Interior Department]], in efforts by the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] to strip Louisiana of its submerged land property rights. These control vast stores of reservoirs of petroleum and natural gas.\n\nWhen petroleum and gas [[1973 oil crisis|boomed]] in the 1970s, so did Louisiana's economy. The Louisiana economy as well as its politics of the last half-century cannot be understood without thoroughly accounting for the influence of the petroleum and gas industries. Since the 1980s, these industries' headquarters have consolidated in [[Houston]], but many of the jobs that operate or provide logistical support to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico crude-oil-and-gas industry remained in Louisiana {{as of|lc=y|2010}}.\n\n==Law and government==\n\n{{Politics of Louisiana}}\n<!--This section is linked from [[Law of the United Kingdom]]-->\n:{{Further|List of Louisiana Governors|Louisiana law|Louisiana Constitution}}\n[[File:Louisiana State Capitol Building.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Louisiana State Capitol]] in Baton Rouge, the [[Heights of state capitols|tallest state capitol building]] in the United States]]\n[[File:LAGovMansion.JPG|right|thumb|The Louisiana Governor's Mansion]]\n\nIn 1849, the state moved the capital from New Orleans to [[Baton Rouge]]. [[Donaldsonville, Louisiana|Donaldsonville]], [[Opelousas, Louisiana|Opelousas]], and [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] have briefly served as the seat of Louisiana state government. The [[Louisiana State Capitol]] and the [[Louisiana Governor's Mansion]] are both located in Baton Rouge. The [[Louisiana Supreme Court]], however, did not move to Baton Rouge but remains headquartered in New Orleans.\n\nLouisiana and California (whose supreme court is seated in San Francisco) are the only two states whose high courts are not headquartered in the state capital.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe current Louisiana governor is [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[John Bel Edwards]]. The current [[United States Senate|United States senators]] are Republicans [[John Neely Kennedy]] and [[Bill Cassidy]]. Louisiana has six [[congressional district]]s and is represented in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] by five Republicans and one Democrat. Louisiana had eight votes in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] for the [[2012 United States presidential election in Louisiana|2012 election]]. It lost one House seat due to stagnant population growth in the 2010 Census.\n\n===Administrative divisions===\n\nLouisiana is divided into 64 [[Parish (administrative division)|parishes]] (the equivalent of [[County (United States)|counties]] in most other states).<ref name=\"nativeamericans\">{{Handbook of Texas|id=bzi04|name=Native Americans}}</ref>\n* [[List of parishes in Louisiana]]\n* [[Louisiana census statistical areas]]\n\nMost parishes have an elected government known as the Police Jury, dating from the colonial days. It is the legislative and executive government of the parish, and is elected by the voters. Its members are called Jurors, and together they elect a president as their chairman.\n\nA more limited number of parishes operate under [[home rule]] charters, electing various forms of government. This include mayor\u2013council, council\u2013manager (in which the council hires a professional operating manager for the parish), and others.\n\n===Civil law===\n\nThe Louisiana political and legal structure has maintained several elements from the times of French and Spanish governance. One is the use of the term \"[[parish (Louisiana)|parish]]\" (from the French: ''paroisse'') in place of \"[[County (United States)|county]]\" for administrative subdivision. Another is the legal system of [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] based on French, German, and Spanish [[legal code]]s and ultimately [[Roman law]], as opposed to English [[common law]].\n\nLouisiana's civil law system is what the majority of nations in the world use, especially in Europe and its former colonies, excluding those that derive from the [[British Empire]]. However, it is incorrect to equate the Louisiana Civil Code with the [[Napoleonic Code]]. Although the Napoleonic Code and Louisiana law draw from common legal roots, the Napoleonic Code was never in force in Louisiana, as it was enacted in 1804, after the United States had [[Louisiana Purchase|purchased]] and annexed Louisiana in 1803.\n\nWhile the Louisiana Civil Code of 1808 has been continuously revised and updated since its enactment, it is still considered the controlling authority in the state. Differences are found between Louisianan civil law and the common law found in the other U.S. states. While some of these differences have been bridged due to the strong influence of common law tradition,<ref name=\"kinsellalaw\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kinsellalaw.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/dictionary.pdf |title=A Civil Law to Common Law Dictionary |accessdate=December 7, 2010 |last=Kinsella |first=Norman |year=1997 |website=KinsellaLaw.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225105448/http://www.kinsellalaw.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/dictionary.pdf |archivedate=December 25, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> the civil law tradition is still deeply rooted in most aspects of Louisiana private law. Thus property, contractual, business entities structure, much of civil procedure, and family law, as well as some aspects of criminal law, are still based mostly on traditional Roman legal thinking.\n\n===Marriage===\n\nIn 1997, Louisiana became the first state to offer the option of a traditional marriage or a [[covenant marriage]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marriage.about.com/cs/covenantmarriage/a/covenant.htm |title=Covenant Marriage\u2014Pros and Cons |publisher=Marriage.about.com |date=January 1, 2012 |accessdate=February 18, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307225008/http://marriage.about.com/cs/covenantmarriage/a/covenant.htm |archive-date=March 7, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> In a covenant marriage, the couple waives their right to a \"no-fault\" divorce after six months of separation, which is available in a traditional marriage.

The franchise for whites was expanded somewhat during these decades, but blacks remained essentially disfranchised until after the [[civil rights movement]] of the mid-20th century, gaining enforcement of their constitutional rights through passage by Congress of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].\n\nSince the 1960s, when civil rights legislation was passed under President [[Lyndon Johnson]] to protect voting and civil rights, most African Americans in the state have affiliated with the Democratic Party. In the same years, many white social conservatives have moved to support Republican Party candidates in national, gubernatorial and statewide elections. In 2004, [[David Vitter]] was the first Republican in Louisiana to be popularly elected as a U.S. senator. The previous Republican senator, [[John S. Harris]], who took office in 1868 during Reconstruction, was chosen by the state legislature under the rules of the 19th century.\n\nLouisiana is unique among U.S. states in using a system for its state and local elections similar to that of modern France. All candidates, regardless of party affiliation, run in a [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] (or \"jungle primary\") on Election Day. If no candidate has more than 50% of the vote, the two candidates with the highest vote totals compete in a runoff election approximately one month later. This run-off method does not take into account party identification; therefore, it is not uncommon for a Democrat to be in a runoff with a fellow Democrat or a Republican to be in a runoff with a fellow Republican.\n\nCongressional races have also been held under the jungle primary system. All other states (except [[Washington Initiative 872 (2004)|Washington]], [[California Proposition 14 (2010)|California]], and [[Maine]]) use single-party primaries followed by a general election between party candidates, each conducted by either a [[plurality voting system]] or [[Two-round system|runoff voting]], to elect senators, representatives, and statewide officials. Between 2008 and 2010, federal [[United States Congress|congressional]] elections were run under a closed primary system\u2014limited to registered party members. However, upon the passage of House Bill 292, Louisiana again adopted a nonpartisan blanket primary for its federal congressional elections.\n\nLouisiana has six seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, five of which are currently held by Republicans and one by a Democrat. The state lost a House seat at the end of the [[112th Congress]] due to stagnant population growth as recorded by the [[2010 United States Census]]. Louisiana is not classified as a \"[[swing state]]\" for future presidential elections, as since the late 20th century, it has regularly supported Republican candidates. The state's two U.S. senators are [[Bill Cassidy]] (R) [[John Neely Kennedy]] (R).\n\n===Law enforcement===\n\n{{See also|List of law enforcement agencies in Louisiana}}\n\nLouisiana's statewide police force is the [[Louisiana State Police]]. It began in 1922 with the creation of the Highway Commission. In 1927, a second branch, the Bureau of Criminal Investigations, was formed. In 1932, the State Highway Patrol was authorized to carry weapons.\n\nOn July 28, 1936, the two branches were consolidated to form the Louisiana Department of State Police; its motto was \"courtesy, loyalty, service\". In 1942, this office was abolished and became a division of the Department of Public Safety, called the Louisiana State Police. In 1988, the Criminal Investigation Bureau was reorganized.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lsp.org/about_hist.html |title=Louisiana State Police\u2014About Us\u2014LSP History |publisher=Lsp.org |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504001036/http://www.lsp.org/about_hist.html |archive-date=May 4, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Its troopers have statewide jurisdiction with power to enforce all laws of the state, including city and parish ordinances. Each year, they patrol over 12 million miles (20&nbsp;million km) of roadway and arrest about 10,000 impaired drivers. The State Police are primarily a traffic enforcement agency, with other sections that delve into trucking safety, narcotics enforcement, and gaming oversight.\n\nThe elected sheriff in each parish is the chief law enforcement officer in the parish. They are the keepers of the local parish prisons, which house felony and misdemeanor prisoners. They are the primary criminal patrol and first responder agency in all matters criminal and civil. They are also the official tax collectors in each parish. The sheriffs are responsible for general law enforcement in their respective parishes. Orleans Parish is an exception, as the general law enforcement duties fall to the New Orleans Police Department. Before 2010, Orleans parish was the only parish to have two sheriff's offices. Orleans Parish divided sheriffs' duties between criminal and civil, with a different elected sheriff overseeing each aspect. In 2006, a bill was passed which eventually consolidated the two sheriff's departments into one parish sheriff responsible for both civil and criminal matters.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn 2015, Louisiana had a higher murder rate (10.3 per 100,000) than any other state in the country for the 27th straight year.

Conditions were harsh, the climate and soil were unsuitable for certain crops the colonists knew, and they suffered from regional tropical diseases. Both colonists and the slaves they imported had high mortality rates. The settlers kept importing slaves, which resulted in a high proportion of native Africans from West Africa, who continued to practice their culture in new surroundings. As described by historian [[Gwendolyn Midlo Hall]], they developed a marked Afro-Creole culture in the colonial era.<ref>Gwendolyn Midlo Hall, ''Africans in Colonial Louisiana: The Development of Afro-Creole Culture in the Eighteenth Century'' (1992)</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/laslave/|title=Afro-Louisiana History and Genealogy|website=www.ibiblio.org|accessdate=October 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190430233835/http://www.ibiblio.org/laslave/|archive-date=April 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAt the turn of the 18th century and in the early 1800s, New Orleans received a major influx of white and mixed-race refugees fleeing the violence of the [[Haitian Revolution]], many of whom brought their slaves with them. This added another infusion of African culture to the city, as more slaves in [[Saint-Domingue]] were from Africa than in the United States. They strongly influenced the African-American culture of the city in terms of dance, music and religious practices.\n\n===Louisiana Creole culture===\n\n[[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]] culture is an amalgamation of French, African, Spanish (and other European), and Native American cultures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laheritage.org/CreoleHeritage/index.html |title=French Creole Heritage |publisher=Laheritage.org |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140830084559/http://www.laheritage.org/CreoleHeritage/index.html |archivedate=August 30, 2014 }}</ref> Creole comes from the Portuguese word ''crioulo''; originally it referred to a colonist of European (specifically French) descent who was born in the New World, in comparison to immigrants from France.<ref>Delehanty, Randolph. ''New Orleans: Elegance and Decadence, Chronicle Books'', 1995, pg. 14</ref> The oldest Louisiana manuscript to use the word \"Creole\", from 1782, applied it to a slave born in the French colony.<ref>Kein, Sybil. ''Creole: The History and Legacy of Louisiana's Free People of Color'', Louisiana State University Press, 2009, p. 73.</ref> But originally it referred more generally to the French colonists born in Louisiana.\n\nOver time, there developed in the French colony a relatively large group of [[Creoles of Color]] (''gens de couleur libres''), who were primarily descended from African slave women and French men (later other Europeans became part of the mix, as well as some Native Americans.) Often the French would free their concubines and [[mixed-race]] children, and pass on social capital to them. They might educate sons in France, for instance, and help them enter the French Army for a career. They also settled capital or property on their mistresses and children. The free people of color gained more rights in the colony and sometimes education; they generally spoke French and were Roman Catholic. Many became artisans and property owners. Over time, the term \"Creole\" became associated with this class of [[Creoles of Color]], many of whom achieved freedom long before the Civil War.\n\nWealthy French Creoles generally maintained town houses in [[New Orleans]] as well as houses on their large sugar plantations outside town along the Mississippi River. New Orleans had the largest population of free people of color in the region; they could find work there and created their own culture, marrying among themselves for decades.\n\n===Acadian culture===\n\nThe ancestors of [[Cajun]]s immigrated mostly from west central France to New France, where they settled in the Atlantic provinces of [[New Brunswick]], [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Prince Edward Island]], known originally as [[Acadia]]. After the British defeated France in the [[French and Indian War]] ([[Seven Years' War]]) in 1763, France ceded its territory east of the Mississippi River to Britain. The British forcibly separated families and evicted them from Acadia because they refused to vow loyalty to the new British regime. The Acadians were deported to England, New England, and France. Some escaped the British remained in [[French Canada]].\n\nOthers scattered, to France, Canada, Mexico, or the Falkland Islands. Many Acadian refugees settled in south Louisiana in the region around [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]] and the LaFourche Bayou country. They developed a distinct rural culture there, different from the French Creole colonists of New Orleans. Intermarrying with others in the area, they developed what was called Cajun music, cuisine and culture. Until the 1970s, the term \"Cajun\" was considered somewhat derogatory.\n\n===Isle\u00f1o culture===\n\n{{Main|Isle\u00f1o (Louisiana)}}\n[[File:El_Museo_de_los_Isle\u00f1os.jpg|alt=|thumb|El Museo de los Isle\u00f1os (Isle\u00f1o Museum) in [[Saint Bernard, Louisiana|Saint Bernard]]]]\n\nA third distinct culture in Louisiana is that of the Isle\u00f1os. Its members are descendants of colonists from the [[Canary Islands]] who settled in [[Spanish Louisiana]] between 1778 and 1783 and intermarried with other communities such as [[French people|Frenchman]], [[Acadians]], [[Louisiana Creole people|Creoles]], [[Spaniards]], and other groups, mainly through the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nIn Louisiana, the Isle\u00f1os originally settled in four communities which included Galveztown, Valenzuela, Barataria, and San Bernardo. Of those settlements, Valenzuela and San Bernardo were the most successful as the other two were plagued with both disease and flooding. The large migration of [[Acadian]] refugees to [[Bayou Lafourche]] led to the rapid gallicization of the Valenzuela community while the community of San Bernardo ([[Saint Bernard Parish, Louisiana|Saint Bernard]]) was able to preserve much of its unique culture and language into the 21st century. This being said, the transmission of Spanish and other customs has completely halted in St. Bernard with those having competency in Spanish being octogenarians.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite book|title=The Language of the Isle\u00f1os: Vestigial Spanish in Louisiana|last1=Lipski|first1=John|date=July 1, 1990|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|isbn=0807115347|location=|pages=i, 4}}</ref>\n\nThrough the centuries, the various Isle\u00f1o communities of Louisiana have kept alive different elements of their Canary Islander heritage while also adopting and building upon the customs and traditions of the communities that surround them. Today two heritage associates exist for the communities: Los Isle\u00f1os Heritage and Cultural Society of St. Bernard as well as the Canary Islanders Heritage Society of Louisiana. The [[Isle\u00f1os Fiesta|Fiesta de los Isle\u00f1os]] is celebrated annually in St. Bernard Parish which features heritage performances from local groups and the Canary Islands.\n\n===Languages===\n\n[[File:Native Languages of Louisiana.svg|thumbnail|The languages of historic Native American tribes that occupied what is now Louisiana include: Tunica, Caddo, Natchez, Choctaw, Atakapa, Chitimacha and Houma.]]\n\nAccording to a 2010 study by the Modern Language Association, among persons five years old and older,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mla.org/map_data|title=United States|publisher=[[Modern Language Association]]|accessdate=September 2, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201170638/http://www.mla.org/map_data|archive-date=December 1, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> 91.26% of Louisiana residents speak only English at home, 3.45% speak French (standard French, French Creole, or Cajun French), 3.30% speak Spanish, and 0.59% speak [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]].\n\nHistorically, Native American peoples in the area at the time of European encounter were seven tribes distinguished by their languages: [[Caddo language|Caddo]], [[Tunica language|Tunica]], [[Natchez language|Natchez]], [[Houma language|Houma]], [[Choctaw language|Choctaw]], [[Atakapa language|Atakapa]], and [[Chitimacha language|Chitimacha]]. Of these, only Tunica, Caddo and Choctaw still have living native speakers, although several other tribes are working to teach and revitalize their languages. Other Native American peoples migrated into the region, escaping from European pressure from the east. Among these were [[Alabama language|Alabama]], Biloxi, Koasati, and Ofo peoples.\n\nStarting in the 1700s, French colonists began to settle along the coast and founded New Orleans. They established French culture and language institutions. They imported thousands of slaves from tribes of West Africa, who spoke several different languages. In the creolization process, the slaves developed a Louisiana Creole dialect incorporating both French and African forms, which colonists adopted to communicate with them, and which persisted beyond slavery. In the 20th century, there were still people of mixed race, particularly, who spoke Louisiana Creole French.\n\nDuring the 19th century after the [[Louisiana Purchase]] by the United States, English gradually gained prominence for business and government due to the shift in population with settlement by numerous Americans who were English speakers. Many ethnic French families continued to use French in private. Slaves and some free people of color also spoke Louisiana Creole French. The [[Constitution of Louisiana#Louisiana Constitution of 1812|State Constitution of 1812]] gave English official status in legal proceedings, but use of French remained widespread. Subsequent state constitutions reflect the diminishing importance of French. The 1868 constitution, passed during the [[Reconstruction era]] before Louisiana was re-admitted to the Union, banned laws requiring the publication of legal proceedings in languages other than English. Subsequently, the legal status of French recovered somewhat, but it never regained its pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] prominence.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5694&context=lalrev |title=The French Language in Louisiana Law and Legal Education: A Requiem |first=Roger K |last=Ward |journal=Louisiana Law Review |volume=57 |issue=4 |date=Summer 1997 |access-date=October 11, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621233419/http://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5694&context=lalrev |archive-date=June 21, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nSeveral unique dialects of French, Creole, and English are spoken in Louisiana. Dialects of the French language are: [[Colonial French]] and Houma French. [[Louisiana Creole French]] is the term for one of the Creole languages. Two unique dialects developed of the English language: [[Cajun English|Louisiana English]], a French-influenced variety of English in which dropping of postvocalic /r/ is common ; and what is informally known as [[Yat (New Orleans)|Yat]], which resembles the [[New York City English|New York City dialect]] sometimes with southern influences, particularly that of historical [[Brooklyn]]. Both accents were influenced by large communities of immigrant Irish and Italians, but the Yat dialect, which developed in New Orleans, was also influenced by French and Spanish.\n[[File:Signalisation routi\u00e8re bilingue \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e de la Louisiane.jpg|thumb|Louisiana's bilingual state welcome sign, recognizing its French heritage]]\n\n[[Colonial French]] was the dominant language of white settlers in [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] during the French colonial period; it was spoken primarily by the French Creoles (native-born). In addition to this dialect, the mixed-race people and slaves developed [[Louisiana Creole French|Louisiana Creole]], with a base in West African languages. The limited years of Spanish rule at the end of the 18th century did not result in widespread adoption of the Spanish language. French and Louisiana Creole are still used in modern-day Louisiana, often in family gatherings. English and its associated dialects became predominant after the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, after which the area became dominated by numerous English speakers. In some regions, English was influenced by French, as seen with Louisiana English. [[Colonial French]], although mistakenly named Cajun French by some Cajuns, has persisted alongside English.\n\nRenewed interest in the French language in Louisiana has led to the establishment of Canadian-modeled [[French immersion]] schools, as well as bilingual signage in the historic French neighborhoods of New Orleans and [[Lafayette (Louisiana)|Lafayette]]. In addition to private organizations, since 1968 the state has maintained the [[Council for the Development of French in Louisiana]] (CODOFIL), which promotes use of the French language in the state's tourism, economic development, culture, education and international relations. Through that office's efforts, in 2018 the state became the first in the nation to join the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] as an observer.<ref name=\"OIFlouisiane\">{{cite magazine|magazine=France-Am\u00e9rique|location=New York|language=French|url=https://france-amerique.com/fr/la-francophonie-decision-confirms-the-rebirth-of-french-in-louisiana/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190524100821/https://france-amerique.com/fr/la-francophonie-decision-confirms-the-rebirth-of-french-in-louisiana/|archive-date=May 24, 2019|date=October 18, 2018|last=Thiery|first=Cl\u00e9ment|title=La d\u00e9cision de l'OIF confirme la renaissance du fran\u00e7ais en Louisiane}}</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n\n{{Main|Literature of Louisiana}}\n\n===Music===\n\n{{Main|Music of Louisiana}}\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Portal|United States}}\n* [[Louisiana (New France)]]\n* [[Index of Louisiana-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of Louisiana]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n* ''The Sugar Masters: Planters and Slaves in Louisiana's Cane World, 1820\u20131860'' by Richard Follett, Louisiana State University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-8071-3247-0}}\n* ''The Slave Trade: The Story of the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1440\u20131870'' by Hugh Thomas. 1997: Simon and Schuster. p.&nbsp;548.\n* ''[[Inhuman Bondage: The Rise and Fall of Slavery in the New World]]'' by [[David Brion Davis]] 2006: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-533944-4}}\n* [[Yiannopoulos, A.N.]], ''The Civil Codes of Louisiana'' (reprinted from Civil Law System: Louisiana and Comparative law, A Coursebook: Texts, Cases and Materials, 3d Edition; similar to version in preface to Louisiana Civil Code, ed. by Yiannopoulos)\n* Rodolfo Batiza, \"The Louisiana Civil Code of 1808: Its Actual Sources and Present Relevance\", 46 ''TUL.

The alluvial region includes low swamp lands, coastal marshlands and beaches, and [[barrier islands]] that cover about {{convert|20000|sqmi|km2}}. This area lies principally along the Gulf of Mexico and the [[Mississippi River]], which traverses the state from north to south for a distance of about {{convert|600|mi|-1|abbr=on}} and empties into the Gulf of Mexico; the [[Red River of the South|Red River]]; the [[Ouachita River]] and its branches; and other minor streams (some of which are called [[bayous]]).\n\nThe breadth of the alluvial region along the Mississippi is from 10 to 60 miles (15 to 100&nbsp;km), and along the other rivers, the alluvial region averages about 10 miles (15&nbsp;km) across. The Mississippi River flows along a ridge formed by its natural deposits (known as a [[levee]]), from which the lands decline toward a river beyond at an average fall of six feet per mile (3&nbsp;m/km). The alluvial lands along other streams present similar features.\n\nThe higher and contiguous hill lands of the north and northwestern part of the state have an area of more than {{convert|25000|sqmi|km2}}. They consist of prairie and woodlands. The elevations above sea level range from 10 feet (3&nbsp;m) at the coast and swamp lands to 50 and 60 feet (15\u201318&nbsp;m) at the prairie and alluvial lands. In the uplands and hills, the elevations rise to [[Driskill Mountain]], the highest point in the state only 535 feet (163&nbsp;m) above sea level. From 1932 to 2010 the state lost 1,800 square miles due to rises in sea level and [[erosion]]. The [[Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority]] (CPRA) spends around $1&nbsp;billion per year to help shore up and protect Louisiana [[shore]]line and land in both federal and state funding.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21727099-has-lessons-americas-climate-change-policy-louisiana-fights-sea-and-loses|title=Louisiana fights the sea, and loses|website=The Economist|access-date=August 28, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828163535/https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21727099-has-lessons-americas-climate-change-policy-louisiana-fights-sea-and-loses|archive-date=August 28, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBesides the waterways already named, there are the [[Sabine River (Texas-Louisiana)|Sabine]], forming the western boundary; and the [[Pearl River (Mississippi-Louisiana)|Pearl]], the eastern boundary; the [[Calcasieu River|Calcasieu]], the [[Mermentau River|Mermentau]], the [[Vermilion River (Louisiana)|Vermilion]], [[Bayou Teche]], the [[Atchafalaya River|Atchafalaya]], the [[Boeuf River|Boeuf]], [[Bayou Lafourche]], the Courtableau River, Bayou D'Arbonne, the Macon River, the [[Tensas River|Tensas]], [[Amite River]], the [[Tchefuncte River|Tchefuncte]], the [[Tickfaw River|Tickfaw]], the [[Natalbany River]], and a number of other smaller streams, constituting a natural system of navigable waterways, aggregating over {{convert|4000|mi|km}} long.\n\nThe state also has political jurisdiction over the approximately {{convert|3|mi|km|adj=on}}-wide portion of [[subsea]] land of the [[Outer continental shelf|inner continental shelf]] in the Gulf of Mexico.

Swamps have been extensively logged, leaving canals and ditches that allow salt water to move inland. Canals dug for the oil and gas industry also allow storms to move sea water inland, where it damages swamps and marshes. Rising sea waters have exacerbated the problem. Some researchers estimate that the state is losing a landmass equivalent to 30 football fields every day. There are many proposals to save coastal areas by reducing human damage, including restoring natural floods from the Mississippi. Without such restoration, coastal communities will continue to disappear.<ref>Boesch, D. F., Josselyn, M. N., Mehta, A. J., Morris, J. T., Nuttle, W. K., Simenstad, C. A., and Swift, D. P. J.

The subtropical characteristics of the state are due to its low latitude, low lying topography, and the influence of the [[Gulf of Mexico]], which at its farthest point is no more than {{convert|200|mi|-1|abbr=on}} away.\n\nRain is frequent throughout the year, although from April to September is slightly wetter than the rest of the year, which is the state's [[wet season]]. There is a dip in precipitation in October. In summer, thunderstorms build during the heat of the day and bring intense but brief, tropical downpours. In winter, rainfall is more frontal and less intense.\n\nSummers in southern Louisiana have high temperatures from June through September averaging 90&nbsp;\u00b0F (32&nbsp;\u00b0C) or more, and overnight lows averaging above 70&nbsp;\u00b0F (22&nbsp;\u00b0C). At times, temperatures in the 90s F, combined with [[dew points]] in the upper 70s F, create sensible temperatures over {{convert|120|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}. The humid, thick, jungle-like heat in southern Louisiana is a famous subject of countless stories and movies.\n\nTemperatures are generally warm in the winter in the southern part of the state, with highs around New Orleans, Baton Rouge, the rest of south Louisiana, and the Gulf of Mexico averaging 66&nbsp;\u00b0F (19&nbsp;\u00b0C). The northern part of the state is mildly cool in the winter, with highs averaging 59&nbsp;\u00b0F (15&nbsp;\u00b0C). The overnight lows in the winter average well above freezing throughout the state, with 46&nbsp;\u00b0F (8&nbsp;\u00b0C) the average near the Gulf and an average low of 37&nbsp;\u00b0F (3&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the winter in the northern part of the state.\n\nOn occasion, cold fronts from low-pressure centers to the north, reach Louisiana in winter. Low temperatures near 20&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u22128&nbsp;\u00b0C) occur on occasion in the northern part of the state but rarely do so in the southern part of the state. [[Snow in Louisiana|Snow]] is rare near the Gulf of Mexico, although residents in the northern parts of the state might receive a dusting of snow a few times each decade. Louisiana's highest recorded temperature is {{convert|114|F|C}} in [[Plain Dealing, Louisiana|Plain Dealing]] on August 10, 1936, while the coldest recorded temperature is {{convert|-16|F|C}} at [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]] on February 13, 1899.\n\nLouisiana is often affected by [[tropical cyclone]]s and is very vulnerable to strikes by major [[Atlantic hurricane|hurricanes]], particularly the lowlands around and in the New Orleans area. The unique geography of the region, with the many bayous, marshes and inlets, can result in water damage across a wide area from major hurricanes. The area is also prone to frequent thunderstorms, especially in the summer.<ref name=\"Annual average number of tornadoes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |title=NOAA National Climatic Data Center |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016174155/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |archive-date=October 16, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe entire state averages over 60 days of thunderstorms a year, more than any other state except Florida. Louisiana averages 27 [[tornado]]es annually. The entire state is vulnerable to a tornado strike, with the extreme southern portion of the state slightly less so than the rest of the state.

The first permanent settlement, Fort Maurepas (at what is now [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi]], near [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]]), was founded in 1699 by [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]], a French military officer from Canada.

The French settlement had two purposes: to establish trade with the Spanish in [[Texas]] via the Old San Antonio Road, and to deter Spanish advances into Louisiana. The settlement soon became a flourishing river port and crossroads, giving rise to vast cotton kingdoms along the river that were worked by imported African slaves. Over time, planters developed large plantations and built fine homes in a growing town. This became a pattern repeated in New Orleans and other places, although the commodity crop in the south was primarily sugar cane.\n[[File:Atchafalaya Basin.jpg|thumb|French Acadians, who came to be known as [[Cajuns]], settled the swamps of southern Louisiana, especially in the [[Atchafalaya Basin]].]]\n\nLouisiana's French settlements contributed to further exploration and outposts, concentrated along the banks of the Mississippi and its major tributaries, from Louisiana to as far north as the region called the [[Illinois Country]], around present-day [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. The latter was settled by French colonists from Illinois.\n\nInitially, [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] and then [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]] served as the capital of La Louisiane. Recognizing the importance of the Mississippi River to trade and military interests, and wanting to protect the capital from severe coastal storms, France developed New Orleans from 1722 as the seat of civilian and military authority south of the Great Lakes. From then until the United States acquired the territory in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, France and Spain jockeyed for control of New Orleans and the lands west of the Mississippi.\n\nIn the 1720s, German immigrants settled along the Mississippi River, in a region referred to as the [[German Coast]].\n\nFrance ceded most of its territory to the east of the Mississippi to Great Britain in 1763, in the aftermath of [[Great Britain in the Seven Years War|Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War]] (generally referred to in North America as the [[French and Indian War]]). The rest of Louisiana, including the area around New Orleans and the parishes around [[Lake Pontchartrain]], had become a colony of Spain by the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]] (1762). The transfer of power on either side of the river would be delayed until later in the decade.\n\nIn 1765, during Spanish rule, several thousand French-speaking refugees from the region of [[Acadia]] (now [[Nova Scotia]], New Brunswick, and [[Prince Edward Island]], Canada) made their way to Louisiana after having been [[Expulsion of the Acadians|expelled]] from their homelands by the British during the French and Indian War. They settled chiefly in the southwestern Louisiana region now called [[Acadiana]]. The Spanish, eager to gain more Catholic settlers, welcomed the [[Acadian]] refugees, the ancestors of Louisiana's [[Cajun]]s.\n\nSpanish Canary Islanders, called [[Isle\u00f1os]], emigrated from the Canary Islands of Spain to Louisiana under the Spanish crown between 1778 and 1783.\n\nIn 1800, France's [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] reacquired Louisiana from Spain in the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso|Treaty of San Ildefonso]], an arrangement kept secret for two years.\n\n===Expansion of slavery===\n\n{{main|History of slavery in Louisiana}}\n\n[[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville]] brought the first two African slaves to Louisiana in 1708, transporting them from a French colony in the West Indies. In 1709, French financier [[Antoine Crozat]] obtained a monopoly of commerce in [[La Louisiane]], which extended from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to what is now [[Illinois]]. \"That concession allowed him to bring in a cargo of blacks from Africa every year,\" the British historian [[Hugh Thomas (writer)|Hugh Thomas]] wrote.<ref>''The Slave Trade: The Story of the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1440\u20131870'' by Hugh Thomas. 1997: Simon and Schuster. p. 242-43</ref> Physical conditions, including disease, were so harsh there was high mortality among both the colonists and the slaves, resulting in continuing demand and importation of slaves.\n\nStarting in 1719, traders began to import slaves in higher numbers; two French ships, the ''Du Maine'' and the ''Aurore'', arrived in New Orleans carrying more than 500 black slaves coming from Africa. Previous slaves in Louisiana had been transported from French colonies in the West Indies. By the end of 1721, New Orleans counted 1,256 inhabitants, of whom about half were slaves.\n\nIn 1724, the French government issued a law called the [[Code Noir]] (\"Black Code\" in English) which \"regulate[d] the interaction of whites [blancs] and blacks [noirs] in its colony of Louisiana<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.knowlouisiana.org/entry/code-noir-of-louisiana|title=Code Noir of Louisiana\u2014Know Louisiana|publisher=|access-date=April 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518041714/http://www.knowlouisiana.org/entry/code-noir-of-louisiana|archive-date=May 18, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> (which was much larger than the current state of Louisiana). The law consisted of 57 articles, which regulated religion in the colony, outlawed \"interracial\" marriages (those between people of different skin color, the varying shades of which were also defined by law), restricted [[manumission]], outlined legal punishment of slaves for various offenses, and defined some obligations of owners to their slaves. The main intent of the French government was to assert control over the slave system of agriculture in Louisiana and to impose restrictions on slaveowners there. In practice, the Code Noir was exceedingly difficult to enforce from afar. Some priests continued to perform interracial marriage ceremonies, for example, and some slaveholders continued to manumit slaves without permission while others punished slaves brutally.\n\nArticle II of the Code Noir of 1724 required owners to provide their slaves with religious education in the state religion, Roman Catholicism. Sunday was to be a day of rest for slaves. On days off, slaves were expected to feed and take care of themselves. During the 1740s economic crisis in the colony, owners had trouble feeding their slaves and themselves. Giving them time off also effectively gave more power to slaves, who started cultivating their own gardens and crafting items for sale as their own property. They began to participate in the economic development of the colony while at the same time increasing independence and self-subsistence.\n\nArticle VI of the Code Noir forbade mixed marriages, forbade but did little to protect slave women from rape by their owners, overseers or other slaves. On balance, the Code benefitted the owners but had more protections and flexibility than did the institution of slavery in the southern [[Thirteen Colonies]].\n\nThe Louisiana Black Code of 1806 made the cruel punishment of slaves a crime, but owners and overseers were seldom prosecuted for such acts.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=The law of slavery\u2014Master\u2013slave legal relationships |url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24164 |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007003400/http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24164 |archivedate=October 7, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nFugitive slaves, called maroons, could easily hide in the backcountry of the bayous and survive in small settlements. The word \"maroon\" comes from the Spanish \"cimarron\", meaning \"fugitive cattle\".\n\nIn the late 18th century, the last Spanish governor of the Louisiana territory wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Truly, it is impossible for lower Louisiana to get along without slaves and with the use of slaves, the colony had been making great strides toward prosperity and wealth.<ref name=\"The Slave Trade p. 548\"/></blockquote>\n\nWhen the United States [[Louisiana Purchase|purchased Louisiana]] in 1803, it was soon accepted that enslaved Africans could be brought to Louisiana as easily as they were brought to neighboring [[Mississippi]], though it violated U.S. law to do so.<ref name=\"The Slave Trade p. 548\">Hugh Thomas, ''The Slave Trade: The Story of the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1440\u20131870'', Simon and Schuster, 1997, p. 548.</ref> Despite demands by United States Rep. [[James Hillhouse]] and by the pamphleteer [[Thomas Paine]] to enforce existing federal law against slavery in the newly acquired territory,<ref name=\"The Slave Trade p. 548\" /> slavery prevailed because it was the source of great profits and the lowest-cost labor.\n\nAt the start of the 19th century, Louisiana was a small producer of sugar with a relatively small number of slaves, compared to Saint-Domingue and the West Indies. It soon thereafter became a major sugar producer as new settlers arrived to develop plantations. [[William C. C. Claiborne]], Louisiana's first United States governor, said African slave labor was needed because white laborers \"cannot be had in this unhealthy climate\".<ref>Thomas (1997), ''The Slave Trade'', p. 549.</ref> Hugh Thomas wrote that Claiborne was unable to enforce the abolition of the African slave trade, which the U.S. and Great Britain adopted in 1808. The United States continued to protect the domestic slave trade, including the coastwise trade\u2014the transport of slaves by ship along the Atlantic Coast and to New Orleans and other Gulf ports.\n\nBy 1840, New Orleans had the biggest slave market in the United States, which contributed greatly to the economy of the city and of the state. New Orleans had become one of the wealthiest cities, and the third largest city, in the nation.<ref>Walter Johnson, ''Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1999, p.2</ref> The ban on the African slave trade and importation of slaves had increased demand in the domestic market.

Many sold slaves to traders to take to the Deep South. Slaves were driven by traders overland from the Upper South or transported to New Orleans and other coastal markets by ship in the [[coastwise slave trade]]. After sales in New Orleans, steamboats operating on the Mississippi transported slaves upstream to markets or plantation destinations at Natchez and Memphis.\n\nAs the [[Deep South]] was developed for cotton and sugar in the first half of the nineteenth century, demand for slaves increased. This resulted in a massive forced migration (through the slave trade) of more than one million African Americans from the [[Upper South]] to the Deep South. Many traders brought slaves to New Orleans for domestic sale, and by 1840, New Orleans had the largest slave market in the country, was the third-largest city, and was one of the wealthiest cities.\n[[File:Free Woman of Color with daughter NOLA Collage.jpg|thumb|[[Free people of color|Free woman of color]] with [[mixed-race]] daughter; late 18th-century collage painting, New Orleans]]\n\n===Haitian migration and influence===\n\nSpanish occupation of Louisiana lasted from 1769 to 1800. Beginning in the 1790s, waves of immigration took place from [[Saint-Domingue]], following a [[Haitian Revolution|slave rebellion]] that started in 1791. Over the next decade, thousands of migrants landed in Louisiana from the island, including ethnic Europeans, [[free people of color]], and African slaves, some of the latter brought in by each free group. They greatly increased the French-speaking population in New Orleans and Louisiana, as well as the number of Africans, and the slaves reinforced African culture in the city.

As American settlers pushed west, they found that the [[Appalachian Mountains]] provided a barrier to shipping goods eastward. The easiest way to ship produce was to use a [[flatboat]] to float it down the [[Ohio river|Ohio]] and Mississippi Rivers to the port of New Orleans, where goods could be put on ocean-going vessels. The problem with this route was that the Spanish owned both sides of the Mississippi below [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]].\n\nNapoleon's ambitions in Louisiana involved the creation of a new empire centered on the [[Caribbean]] [[sugar trade]]. By the terms of the Treaty of Amiens of 1802, Great Britain returned ownership of the islands of [[Martinique]] and [[Guadaloupe]] to the French. Napoleon looked upon Louisiana as a depot for these sugar islands, and as a buffer to U.S. settlement. In October 1801 he sent a large military force to take back Saint-Domingue, then under control of Toussaint Louverture after a slave rebellion.\nWhen the army led by Napoleon's brother-in-law Leclerc was defeated, Napoleon decided to sell Louisiana.\n[[File:Louisiane 1800.png|thumb|Map of Louisiana in 1800]]\n\n[[Thomas Jefferson]], third president of the United States, was disturbed by Napoleon's plans to re-establish French colonies in America. With the possession of New Orleans, Napoleon could close the Mississippi to U.S. commerce at any time. Jefferson authorized [[Robert Livingston (1746\u20131813)|Robert R. Livingston]], U.S. Minister to France, to negotiate for the purchase of the City of New Orleans, portions of the east bank of the Mississippi, and free navigation of the river for U.S. commerce. Livingston was authorized to pay up to $2&nbsp;million.\n\nAn official transfer of Louisiana to French ownership had not yet taken place, and Napoleon's deal with the Spanish was a poorly kept secret on the frontier. On October 18, 1802, however, Juan Ventura Morales, Acting Intendant of Louisiana, made public the intention of Spain to revoke the right of deposit at New Orleans for all cargo from the United States. The closure of this vital port to the United States caused anger and consternation. Commerce in the west was virtually blockaded. Historians believe the revocation of the right of deposit was prompted by abuses by the Americans, particularly smuggling, and not by French intrigues as was believed at the time. President Jefferson ignored public pressure for war with France, and appointed [[James Monroe]] a special envoy to Napoleon, to assist in obtaining New Orleans for the United States. Jefferson also raised the authorized expenditure to $10&nbsp;million.\n\nHowever, on April 11, 1803, French Foreign Minister [[Talleyrand]] surprised Livingston by asking how much the United States was prepared to pay for the '''entirety''' of Louisiana, not just New Orleans and the surrounding area (as Livingston's instructions covered). Monroe agreed with Livingston that Napoleon might withdraw this offer at any time (leaving them with no ability to obtain the desired New Orleans area), and that approval from President Jefferson might take months, so Livingston and Monroe decided to open negotiations immediately. By April 30, they closed a deal for the purchase of the entire Louisiana territory of {{convert|828000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} for 60 million [[French franc|Francs]] (approximately $15&nbsp;million).\n\nPart of this sum, $3.5&nbsp;million, was used to forgive debts owed by France to the United States.<ref>Peter Kastor, ''The Nation's Crucible: The Louisiana Purchase and the Creation of America'', (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004) 40</ref> The payment was made in United States [[Government bond|bonds]], which Napoleon sold at face value to the Dutch firm of [[Hope & Co.|Hope and Company]], and the [[Barings Bank|British banking house of Baring]], at a discount of 87\u00bd per each $100 unit. As a result, France received only $8,831,250 in cash for Louisiana. English banker [[Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton|Alexander Baring]] conferred with Marbois in Paris, shuttled to the United States to pick up the bonds, took them to Britain, and returned to France with the money\u2014which Napoleon used to wage war against Baring's own country.\n[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - Louisiana Purchase, 1803.jpg|thumb|Louisiana Purchase, 1803]]\n\nWhen news of the purchase reached the United States, Jefferson was surprised. He had authorized the expenditure of $10&nbsp;million for a port city, and instead received treaties committing the government to spend $15&nbsp;million on a land package which would double the size of the country. Jefferson's political opponents in the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]] argued the Louisiana purchase was a worthless desert,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AsY9Vh9X8ZYC&dq=%22louisiana+purchase%22+federalist+desert+jefferson&q=worthless+desert |title=The American pageant: a history of the republic\u2014Thomas A.

What really worried the opposition was the new states which would inevitably be carved from the Louisiana territory, strengthening Western and Southern interests in Congress, and further reducing the influence of New England Federalists in national affairs. President Jefferson was an enthusiastic supporter of westward expansion, and held firm in his support for the treaty. Despite Federalist objections, the U.S. Senate ratified the Louisiana treaty on October 20, 1803.\n\nBy statute enacted on October 31, 1803, President Thomas Jefferson was authorized to take possession of the territories ceded by France and provide for initial governance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002/llsl002.db&recNum=282|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774\u20131875|website=memory.loc.gov|access-date=December 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220085715/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002%2Fllsl002.db&recNum=282|archive-date=December 20, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> A transfer ceremony was held in New Orleans on November 29, 1803. Since the Louisiana territory had never officially been turned over to the French, the Spanish took down their flag, and the French raised theirs. The following day, [[General James Wilkinson]] accepted possession of New Orleans for the United States. A similar ceremony was held in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] on March 9, 1804, when a French tricolor was raised near the river, replacing the Spanish national flag. The following day, [[Captain (U.S. Army)|Captain]] [[Amos Stoddard]] of the First U.S. Artillery marched his troops into town and had the American flag run up the fort's flagpole. The Louisiana territory was officially transferred to the United States government, represented by [[Meriwether Lewis]].\n\nThe Louisiana Territory, purchased for less than three cents an acre, doubled the size of the United States overnight, without a war or the loss of a single American life, and set a precedent for the purchase of territory. It opened the way for the eventual expansion of the United States across the continent to the Pacific.\n\nShortly after the United States took possession, the area was divided into two territories along the [[33rd parallel north]] on March 26, 1804, thereby organizing the [[Territory of Orleans]] to the south and the [[District of Louisiana]] (subsequently formed as the [[Louisiana Territory]]) to the north.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002/llsl002.db&recNum=320|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774\u20131875|website=rs6.loc.gov|access-date=December 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220091706/http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002%2Fllsl002.db&recNum=320|archive-date=December 20, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Statehood (1812)===\n\n{{Main|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|Seminole Wars|Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty}}\n\nLouisiana became the eighteenth U.S. state on April 30, 1812; the Territory of Orleans became the State of Louisiana and the Louisiana Territory was simultaneously renamed the [[Missouri Territory]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002/llsl002.db&recNum=738|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774\u20131875|website=memory.loc.gov|access-date=December 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105021747/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002%2Fllsl002.db&recNum=738|archive-date=January 5, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> An area known as the [[Florida Parishes]] was soon annexed into the state of Louisiana on April 14, 1812.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002/llsl002.db&recNum=745|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774\u20131875|website=memory.loc.gov|access-date=December 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202191512/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002%2Fllsl002.db&recNum=745|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1824 to 1861, Louisiana moved from a political system based on personality and ethnicity to a distinct two-party system, with Democrats competing first against ''Whigs'', then ''Know Nothings'', and finally only other [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].<ref>John M.

Initially state legislatures were dominated by former Confederates, who passed Black Codes to regulate [[freedmen]] and generally refused to give the vote. They refused to extend voting rights to African Americans who had been free before the war and had sometimes obtained education and property (as in New Orleans.) Following the [[Memphis riots of 1866]] and the [[New Orleans riot]] the same year, the Fourteenth Amendment was passed that provided suffrage and full citizenship for freedmen. Congress passed the Reconstruction Act, establishing military districts for those states where conditions were considered the worst, including Louisiana. It was grouped with [[Texas]] in what was administered as the [[Fifth Military District]].\n\nAfrican Americans began to live as citizens with some measure of equality before the law. Both [[freedmen]] and [[free people of color|people of color]] who had been free before the war began to make more advances in education, family stability and jobs. At the same time, there was tremendous social volatility in the aftermath of war, with many whites actively resisting defeat and the free labor market. White [[insurgents]] mobilized to enforce [[white supremacy]], first in [[Ku Klux Klan]] chapters.\n\nBy 1877, when federal forces were withdrawn, white Democrats in Louisiana and other states had regained control of state legislatures, often by paramilitary groups such as the [[White League]], which suppressed black voting through intimidation and violence. Following Mississippi's example in 1890, in 1898, the white Democratic, planter-dominated legislature passed a new constitution that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] people of color, by raising barriers to voter registration, such as [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], residency requirements and [[literacy tests]]. The effect was immediate and long lasting. In 1896, there were 130,334 black voters on the rolls and about the same number of white voters, in proportion to the state population, which was evenly divided.<ref>{{Cite journal|ssrn=224731 |title=Richard H.

Because of French and Spanish heritage, and their descendants the Creoles, and later Irish, Italian, Portuguese and German immigrants, southern Louisiana and the greater New Orleans area are predominantly Catholic.<ref>For Louisiana's position in a larger religious context, see [[Bible Belt]].</ref>\n\nSince Creoles were the first settlers, planters and leaders of the territory, they have traditionally been well represented in politics. For instance, most of the early governors were Creole Catholics.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Louisiana}}</ref> Because Catholics still constitute a significant fraction of Louisiana's population, they have continued to be influential in state politics. {{As of|2008}} both Senators and the governor were Catholic. The high proportion and influence of the Catholic population makes Louisiana distinct among Southern states.<ref>Other Southern states have longstanding indigenous Catholic populations, and Florida's largely Catholic population of Cuban emigres has been influential since the 1960s. Yet, Louisiana is still unusual or exceptional in its extent of aboriginal Catholic settlement and influence. Among states in the [[Deep South]] (discounting [[Florida Panhandle|Florida's Panhandle]] and much of Texas) the historic role of Catholicism in Louisiana is unparalleled and unique. Among the states of the Union, Louisiana's unique use of the term ''parish'' (French ''la parouche'' or \"la paroisse\") for ''county'' is rooted in the pre-statehood role of Catholic church parishes in the administration of government.</ref>\n\n[[Jewish]] communities are established in the state's larger cities, notably New Orleans and Baton Rouge.<ref>Isaacs, Ronald H.

Neighboring states and the amount of federal spending received per dollar of federal tax collected were: Texas ($0.94), Arkansas ($1.41), and Mississippi ($2.02).

Petroleum and gas deposits are found in abundance both onshore and offshore in State-owned waters. In addition, vast petroleum and natural gas reserves are found offshore from Louisiana in the federally administered [[Outer Continental Shelf]] (OCS) in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. According to the [[Energy Information Administration]], the Gulf of Mexico OCS is the largest U.S. petroleum-producing region. Excluding the Gulf of Mexico OCS, Louisiana ranks fourth in petroleum production and is home to about two percent of the total U.S. petroleum reserves.\n\nLouisiana's natural gas reserves account for about five percent of the U.S. total. The recent discovery of the [[Haynesville Shale]] formation in parts of or all of Caddo, Bossier, Bienville, Sabine, De Soto, Red River, and Natchitoches parishes have made it the world's fourth largest gas field with some wells initially producing over 25 million cubic feet of gas daily.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/state_energy_profiles.cfm?sid=LA |title=EIA State Energy Profiles: Louisiana |date=June 12, 2008 |accessdate=June 24, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206050811/http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/state_energy_profiles.cfm?sid=LA |archive-date=February 6, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nLouisiana was the first site of [[Oil well|petroleum drilling]] over water in the world, on [[Caddo Lake]] in the northwest corner of the state. The petroleum and gas industry, as well as its subsidiary industries such as transport and [[Oil refinery|refining]], have dominated Louisiana's economy since the 1940s. Beginning in 1950, Louisiana was sued several times by the [[United States Department of the Interior|U.S. Interior Department]], in efforts by the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] to strip Louisiana of its submerged land property rights. These control vast stores of reservoirs of petroleum and natural gas.\n\nWhen petroleum and gas [[1973 oil crisis|boomed]] in the 1970s, so did Louisiana's economy. The Louisiana economy as well as its politics of the last half-century cannot be understood without thoroughly accounting for the influence of the petroleum and gas industries. Since the 1980s, these industries' headquarters have consolidated in [[Houston]], but many of the jobs that operate or provide logistical support to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico crude-oil-and-gas industry remained in Louisiana {{as of|lc=y|2010}}.\n\n==Law and government==\n\n{{Politics of Louisiana}}\n<!--This section is linked from [[Law of the United Kingdom]]-->\n:{{Further|List of Louisiana Governors|Louisiana law|Louisiana Constitution}}\n[[File:Louisiana State Capitol Building.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Louisiana State Capitol]] in Baton Rouge, the [[Heights of state capitols|tallest state capitol building]] in the United States]]\n[[File:LAGovMansion.JPG|right|thumb|The Louisiana Governor's Mansion]]\n\nIn 1849, the state moved the capital from New Orleans to [[Baton Rouge]]. [[Donaldsonville, Louisiana|Donaldsonville]], [[Opelousas, Louisiana|Opelousas]], and [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] have briefly served as the seat of Louisiana state government. The [[Louisiana State Capitol]] and the [[Louisiana Governor's Mansion]] are both located in Baton Rouge. The [[Louisiana Supreme Court]], however, did not move to Baton Rouge but remains headquartered in New Orleans.\n\nLouisiana and California (whose supreme court is seated in San Francisco) are the only two states whose high courts are not headquartered in the state capital.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe current Louisiana governor is [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[John Bel Edwards]]. The current [[United States Senate|United States senators]] are Republicans [[John Neely Kennedy]] and [[Bill Cassidy]]. Louisiana has six [[congressional district]]s and is represented in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] by five Republicans and one Democrat. Louisiana had eight votes in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] for the [[2012 United States presidential election in Louisiana|2012 election]]. It lost one House seat due to stagnant population growth in the 2010 Census.\n\n===Administrative divisions===\n\nLouisiana is divided into 64 [[Parish (administrative division)|parishes]] (the equivalent of [[County (United States)|counties]] in most other states).<ref name=\"nativeamericans\">{{Handbook of Texas|id=bzi04|name=Native Americans}}</ref>\n* [[List of parishes in Louisiana]]\n* [[Louisiana census statistical areas]]\n\nMost parishes have an elected government known as the Police Jury, dating from the colonial days. It is the legislative and executive government of the parish, and is elected by the voters. Its members are called Jurors, and together they elect a president as their chairman.\n\nA more limited number of parishes operate under [[home rule]] charters, electing various forms of government. This include mayor\u2013council, council\u2013manager (in which the council hires a professional operating manager for the parish), and others.\n\n===Civil law===\n\nThe Louisiana political and legal structure has maintained several elements from the times of French and Spanish governance. One is the use of the term \"[[parish (Louisiana)|parish]]\" (from the French: ''paroisse'') in place of \"[[County (United States)|county]]\" for administrative subdivision. Another is the legal system of [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] based on French, German, and Spanish [[legal code]]s and ultimately [[Roman law]], as opposed to English [[common law]].\n\nLouisiana's civil law system is what the majority of nations in the world use, especially in Europe and its former colonies, excluding those that derive from the [[British Empire]]. However, it is incorrect to equate the Louisiana Civil Code with the [[Napoleonic Code]]. Although the Napoleonic Code and Louisiana law draw from common legal roots, the Napoleonic Code was never in force in Louisiana, as it was enacted in 1804, after the United States had [[Louisiana Purchase|purchased]] and annexed Louisiana in 1803.\n\nWhile the Louisiana Civil Code of 1808 has been continuously revised and updated since its enactment, it is still considered the controlling authority in the state. Differences are found between Louisianan civil law and the common law found in the other U.S. states. While some of these differences have been bridged due to the strong influence of common law tradition,<ref name=\"kinsellalaw\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kinsellalaw.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/dictionary.pdf |title=A Civil Law to Common Law Dictionary |accessdate=December 7, 2010 |last=Kinsella |first=Norman |year=1997 |website=KinsellaLaw.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225105448/http://www.kinsellalaw.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/dictionary.pdf |archivedate=December 25, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> the civil law tradition is still deeply rooted in most aspects of Louisiana private law. Thus property, contractual, business entities structure, much of civil procedure, and family law, as well as some aspects of criminal law, are still based mostly on traditional Roman legal thinking.\n\n===Marriage===\n\nIn 1997, Louisiana became the first state to offer the option of a traditional marriage or a [[covenant marriage]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marriage.about.com/cs/covenantmarriage/a/covenant.htm |title=Covenant Marriage\u2014Pros and Cons |publisher=Marriage.about.com |date=January 1, 2012 |accessdate=February 18, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307225008/http://marriage.about.com/cs/covenantmarriage/a/covenant.htm |archive-date=March 7, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> In a covenant marriage, the couple waives their right to a \"no-fault\" divorce after six months of separation, which is available in a traditional marriage.

The franchise for whites was expanded somewhat during these decades, but blacks remained essentially disfranchised until after the [[civil rights movement]] of the mid-20th century, gaining enforcement of their constitutional rights through passage by Congress of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].\n\nSince the 1960s, when civil rights legislation was passed under President [[Lyndon Johnson]] to protect voting and civil rights, most African Americans in the state have affiliated with the Democratic Party. In the same years, many white social conservatives have moved to support Republican Party candidates in national, gubernatorial and statewide elections. In 2004, [[David Vitter]] was the first Republican in Louisiana to be popularly elected as a U.S. senator. The previous Republican senator, [[John S. Harris]], who took office in 1868 during Reconstruction, was chosen by the state legislature under the rules of the 19th century.\n\nLouisiana is unique among U.S. states in using a system for its state and local elections similar to that of modern France. All candidates, regardless of party affiliation, run in a [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] (or \"jungle primary\") on Election Day. If no candidate has more than 50% of the vote, the two candidates with the highest vote totals compete in a runoff election approximately one month later. This run-off method does not take into account party identification; therefore, it is not uncommon for a Democrat to be in a runoff with a fellow Democrat or a Republican to be in a runoff with a fellow Republican.\n\nCongressional races have also been held under the jungle primary system. All other states (except [[Washington Initiative 872 (2004)|Washington]], [[California Proposition 14 (2010)|California]], and [[Maine]]) use single-party primaries followed by a general election between party candidates, each conducted by either a [[plurality voting system]] or [[Two-round system|runoff voting]], to elect senators, representatives, and statewide officials. Between 2008 and 2010, federal [[United States Congress|congressional]] elections were run under a closed primary system\u2014limited to registered party members. However, upon the passage of House Bill 292, Louisiana again adopted a nonpartisan blanket primary for its federal congressional elections.\n\nLouisiana has six seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, five of which are currently held by Republicans and one by a Democrat. The state lost a House seat at the end of the [[112th Congress]] due to stagnant population growth as recorded by the [[2010 United States Census]]. Louisiana is not classified as a \"[[swing state]]\" for future presidential elections, as since the late 20th century, it has regularly supported Republican candidates. The state's two U.S. senators are [[Bill Cassidy]] (R) [[John Neely Kennedy]] (R).\n\n===Law enforcement===\n\n{{See also|List of law enforcement agencies in Louisiana}}\n\nLouisiana's statewide police force is the [[Louisiana State Police]]. It began in 1922 with the creation of the Highway Commission. In 1927, a second branch, the Bureau of Criminal Investigations, was formed. In 1932, the State Highway Patrol was authorized to carry weapons.\n\nOn July 28, 1936, the two branches were consolidated to form the Louisiana Department of State Police; its motto was \"courtesy, loyalty, service\". In 1942, this office was abolished and became a division of the Department of Public Safety, called the Louisiana State Police. In 1988, the Criminal Investigation Bureau was reorganized.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lsp.org/about_hist.html |title=Louisiana State Police\u2014About Us\u2014LSP History |publisher=Lsp.org |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504001036/http://www.lsp.org/about_hist.html |archive-date=May 4, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Its troopers have statewide jurisdiction with power to enforce all laws of the state, including city and parish ordinances. Each year, they patrol over 12 million miles (20&nbsp;million km) of roadway and arrest about 10,000 impaired drivers. The State Police are primarily a traffic enforcement agency, with other sections that delve into trucking safety, narcotics enforcement, and gaming oversight.\n\nThe elected sheriff in each parish is the chief law enforcement officer in the parish. They are the keepers of the local parish prisons, which house felony and misdemeanor prisoners. They are the primary criminal patrol and first responder agency in all matters criminal and civil. They are also the official tax collectors in each parish. The sheriffs are responsible for general law enforcement in their respective parishes. Orleans Parish is an exception, as the general law enforcement duties fall to the New Orleans Police Department. Before 2010, Orleans parish was the only parish to have two sheriff's offices. Orleans Parish divided sheriffs' duties between criminal and civil, with a different elected sheriff overseeing each aspect. In 2006, a bill was passed which eventually consolidated the two sheriff's departments into one parish sheriff responsible for both civil and criminal matters.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn 2015, Louisiana had a higher murder rate (10.3 per 100,000) than any other state in the country for the 27th straight year.

Conditions were harsh, the climate and soil were unsuitable for certain crops the colonists knew, and they suffered from regional tropical diseases. Both colonists and the slaves they imported had high mortality rates. The settlers kept importing slaves, which resulted in a high proportion of native Africans from West Africa, who continued to practice their culture in new surroundings. As described by historian [[Gwendolyn Midlo Hall]], they developed a marked Afro-Creole culture in the colonial era.<ref>Gwendolyn Midlo Hall, ''Africans in Colonial Louisiana: The Development of Afro-Creole Culture in the Eighteenth Century'' (1992)</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/laslave/|title=Afro-Louisiana History and Genealogy|website=www.ibiblio.org|accessdate=October 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190430233835/http://www.ibiblio.org/laslave/|archive-date=April 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAt the turn of the 18th century and in the early 1800s, New Orleans received a major influx of white and mixed-race refugees fleeing the violence of the [[Haitian Revolution]], many of whom brought their slaves with them. This added another infusion of African culture to the city, as more slaves in [[Saint-Domingue]] were from Africa than in the United States. They strongly influenced the African-American culture of the city in terms of dance, music and religious practices.\n\n===Louisiana Creole culture===\n\n[[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]] culture is an amalgamation of French, African, Spanish (and other European), and Native American cultures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laheritage.org/CreoleHeritage/index.html |title=French Creole Heritage |publisher=Laheritage.org |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140830084559/http://www.laheritage.org/CreoleHeritage/index.html |archivedate=August 30, 2014 }}</ref> Creole comes from the Portuguese word ''crioulo''; originally it referred to a colonist of European (specifically French) descent who was born in the New World, in comparison to immigrants from France.<ref>Delehanty, Randolph. ''New Orleans: Elegance and Decadence, Chronicle Books'', 1995, pg. 14</ref> The oldest Louisiana manuscript to use the word \"Creole\", from 1782, applied it to a slave born in the French colony.<ref>Kein, Sybil. ''Creole: The History and Legacy of Louisiana's Free People of Color'', Louisiana State University Press, 2009, p. 73.</ref> But originally it referred more generally to the French colonists born in Louisiana.\n\nOver time, there developed in the French colony a relatively large group of [[Creoles of Color]] (''gens de couleur libres''), who were primarily descended from African slave women and French men (later other Europeans became part of the mix, as well as some Native Americans.) Often the French would free their concubines and [[mixed-race]] children, and pass on social capital to them. They might educate sons in France, for instance, and help them enter the French Army for a career. They also settled capital or property on their mistresses and children. The free people of color gained more rights in the colony and sometimes education; they generally spoke French and were Roman Catholic. Many became artisans and property owners. Over time, the term \"Creole\" became associated with this class of [[Creoles of Color]], many of whom achieved freedom long before the Civil War.\n\nWealthy French Creoles generally maintained town houses in [[New Orleans]] as well as houses on their large sugar plantations outside town along the Mississippi River. New Orleans had the largest population of free people of color in the region; they could find work there and created their own culture, marrying among themselves for decades.\n\n===Acadian culture===\n\nThe ancestors of [[Cajun]]s immigrated mostly from west central France to New France, where they settled in the Atlantic provinces of [[New Brunswick]], [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Prince Edward Island]], known originally as [[Acadia]]. After the British defeated France in the [[French and Indian War]] ([[Seven Years' War]]) in 1763, France ceded its territory east of the Mississippi River to Britain. The British forcibly separated families and evicted them from Acadia because they refused to vow loyalty to the new British regime. The Acadians were deported to England, New England, and France. Some escaped the British remained in [[French Canada]].\n\nOthers scattered, to France, Canada, Mexico, or the Falkland Islands. Many Acadian refugees settled in south Louisiana in the region around [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]] and the LaFourche Bayou country. They developed a distinct rural culture there, different from the French Creole colonists of New Orleans. Intermarrying with others in the area, they developed what was called Cajun music, cuisine and culture. Until the 1970s, the term \"Cajun\" was considered somewhat derogatory.\n\n===Isle\u00f1o culture===\n\n{{Main|Isle\u00f1o (Louisiana)}}\n[[File:El_Museo_de_los_Isle\u00f1os.jpg|alt=|thumb|El Museo de los Isle\u00f1os (Isle\u00f1o Museum) in [[Saint Bernard, Louisiana|Saint Bernard]]]]\n\nA third distinct culture in Louisiana is that of the Isle\u00f1os. Its members are descendants of colonists from the [[Canary Islands]] who settled in [[Spanish Louisiana]] between 1778 and 1783 and intermarried with other communities such as [[French people|Frenchman]], [[Acadians]], [[Louisiana Creole people|Creoles]], [[Spaniards]], and other groups, mainly through the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nIn Louisiana, the Isle\u00f1os originally settled in four communities which included Galveztown, Valenzuela, Barataria, and San Bernardo. Of those settlements, Valenzuela and San Bernardo were the most successful as the other two were plagued with both disease and flooding. The large migration of [[Acadian]] refugees to [[Bayou Lafourche]] led to the rapid gallicization of the Valenzuela community while the community of San Bernardo ([[Saint Bernard Parish, Louisiana|Saint Bernard]]) was able to preserve much of its unique culture and language into the 21st century. This being said, the transmission of Spanish and other customs has completely halted in St. Bernard with those having competency in Spanish being octogenarians.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite book|title=The Language of the Isle\u00f1os: Vestigial Spanish in Louisiana|last1=Lipski|first1=John|date=July 1, 1990|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|isbn=0807115347|location=|pages=i, 4}}</ref>\n\nThrough the centuries, the various Isle\u00f1o communities of Louisiana have kept alive different elements of their Canary Islander heritage while also adopting and building upon the customs and traditions of the communities that surround them. Today two heritage associates exist for the communities: Los Isle\u00f1os Heritage and Cultural Society of St. Bernard as well as the Canary Islanders Heritage Society of Louisiana. The [[Isle\u00f1os Fiesta|Fiesta de los Isle\u00f1os]] is celebrated annually in St. Bernard Parish which features heritage performances from local groups and the Canary Islands.\n\n===Languages===\n\n[[File:Native Languages of Louisiana.svg|thumbnail|The languages of historic Native American tribes that occupied what is now Louisiana include: Tunica, Caddo, Natchez, Choctaw, Atakapa, Chitimacha and Houma.]]\n\nAccording to a 2010 study by the Modern Language Association, among persons five years old and older,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mla.org/map_data|title=United States|publisher=[[Modern Language Association]]|accessdate=September 2, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201170638/http://www.mla.org/map_data|archive-date=December 1, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> 91.26% of Louisiana residents speak only English at home, 3.45% speak French (standard French, French Creole, or Cajun French), 3.30% speak Spanish, and 0.59% speak [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]].\n\nHistorically, Native American peoples in the area at the time of European encounter were seven tribes distinguished by their languages: [[Caddo language|Caddo]], [[Tunica language|Tunica]], [[Natchez language|Natchez]], [[Houma language|Houma]], [[Choctaw language|Choctaw]], [[Atakapa language|Atakapa]], and [[Chitimacha language|Chitimacha]]. Of these, only Tunica, Caddo and Choctaw still have living native speakers, although several other tribes are working to teach and revitalize their languages. Other Native American peoples migrated into the region, escaping from European pressure from the east. Among these were [[Alabama language|Alabama]], Biloxi, Koasati, and Ofo peoples.\n\nStarting in the 1700s, French colonists began to settle along the coast and founded New Orleans. They established French culture and language institutions. They imported thousands of slaves from tribes of West Africa, who spoke several different languages. In the creolization process, the slaves developed a Louisiana Creole dialect incorporating both French and African forms, which colonists adopted to communicate with them, and which persisted beyond slavery. In the 20th century, there were still people of mixed race, particularly, who spoke Louisiana Creole French.\n\nDuring the 19th century after the [[Louisiana Purchase]] by the United States, English gradually gained prominence for business and government due to the shift in population with settlement by numerous Americans who were English speakers. Many ethnic French families continued to use French in private. Slaves and some free people of color also spoke Louisiana Creole French. The [[Constitution of Louisiana#Louisiana Constitution of 1812|State Constitution of 1812]] gave English official status in legal proceedings, but use of French remained widespread. Subsequent state constitutions reflect the diminishing importance of French. The 1868 constitution, passed during the [[Reconstruction era]] before Louisiana was re-admitted to the Union, banned laws requiring the publication of legal proceedings in languages other than English. Subsequently, the legal status of French recovered somewhat, but it never regained its pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] prominence.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5694&context=lalrev |title=The French Language in Louisiana Law and Legal Education: A Requiem |first=Roger K |last=Ward |journal=Louisiana Law Review |volume=57 |issue=4 |date=Summer 1997 |access-date=October 11, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621233419/http://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5694&context=lalrev |archive-date=June 21, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nSeveral unique dialects of French, Creole, and English are spoken in Louisiana. Dialects of the French language are: [[Colonial French]] and Houma French. [[Louisiana Creole French]] is the term for one of the Creole languages. Two unique dialects developed of the English language: [[Cajun English|Louisiana English]], a French-influenced variety of English in which dropping of postvocalic /r/ is common ; and what is informally known as [[Yat (New Orleans)|Yat]], which resembles the [[New York City English|New York City dialect]] sometimes with southern influences, particularly that of historical [[Brooklyn]]. Both accents were influenced by large communities of immigrant Irish and Italians, but the Yat dialect, which developed in New Orleans, was also influenced by French and Spanish.\n[[File:Signalisation routi\u00e8re bilingue \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e de la Louisiane.jpg|thumb|Louisiana's bilingual state welcome sign, recognizing its French heritage]]\n\n[[Colonial French]] was the dominant language of white settlers in [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] during the French colonial period; it was spoken primarily by the French Creoles (native-born). In addition to this dialect, the mixed-race people and slaves developed [[Louisiana Creole French|Louisiana Creole]], with a base in West African languages. The limited years of Spanish rule at the end of the 18th century did not result in widespread adoption of the Spanish language. French and Louisiana Creole are still used in modern-day Louisiana, often in family gatherings. English and its associated dialects became predominant after the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, after which the area became dominated by numerous English speakers. In some regions, English was influenced by French, as seen with Louisiana English. [[Colonial French]], although mistakenly named Cajun French by some Cajuns, has persisted alongside English.\n\nRenewed interest in the French language in Louisiana has led to the establishment of Canadian-modeled [[French immersion]] schools, as well as bilingual signage in the historic French neighborhoods of New Orleans and [[Lafayette (Louisiana)|Lafayette]]. In addition to private organizations, since 1968 the state has maintained the [[Council for the Development of French in Louisiana]] (CODOFIL), which promotes use of the French language in the state's tourism, economic development, culture, education and international relations. Through that office's efforts, in 2018 the state became the first in the nation to join the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] as an observer.<ref name=\"OIFlouisiane\">{{cite magazine|magazine=France-Am\u00e9rique|location=New York|language=French|url=https://france-amerique.com/fr/la-francophonie-decision-confirms-the-rebirth-of-french-in-louisiana/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190524100821/https://france-amerique.com/fr/la-francophonie-decision-confirms-the-rebirth-of-french-in-louisiana/|archive-date=May 24, 2019|date=October 18, 2018|last=Thiery|first=Cl\u00e9ment|title=La d\u00e9cision de l'OIF confirme la renaissance du fran\u00e7ais en Louisiane}}</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n\n{{Main|Literature of Louisiana}}\n\n===Music===\n\n{{Main|Music of Louisiana}}\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Portal|United States}}\n* [[Louisiana (New France)]]\n* [[Index of Louisiana-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of Louisiana]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n* ''The Sugar Masters: Planters and Slaves in Louisiana's Cane World, 1820\u20131860'' by Richard Follett, Louisiana State University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-8071-3247-0}}\n* ''The Slave Trade: The Story of the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1440\u20131870'' by Hugh Thomas. 1997: Simon and Schuster. p.&nbsp;548.\n* ''[[Inhuman Bondage: The Rise and Fall of Slavery in the New World]]'' by [[David Brion Davis]] 2006: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-533944-4}}\n* [[Yiannopoulos, A.N.]], ''The Civil Codes of Louisiana'' (reprinted from Civil Law System: Louisiana and Comparative law, A Coursebook: Texts, Cases and Materials, 3d Edition; similar to version in preface to Louisiana Civil Code, ed. by Yiannopoulos)\n* Rodolfo Batiza, \"The Louisiana Civil Code of 1808: Its Actual Sources and Present Relevance\", 46 ''TUL.
