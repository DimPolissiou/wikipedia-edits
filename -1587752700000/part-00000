She was constructed at [[Forges et Chantiers de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e]], La Seyne. Created as [[protected cruiser]] and used as French [[flagship]] in the [[Far East]]. Polish school [[Hulk (ship type)|hulk]], altered from French [[cruiser]] ''D'Entrecasteaux'' in 1927. Largest warship in [[Second Polish Republic|Second Polish Republic's]] [[Polish Navy|Navy]] and the only cruiser in it. Scrapped in 1942 by [[Nazi Germany|Germans]].\n\n==Design==\nIn the mid-1880s, elements in the French naval command argued over future warship construction; the {{lang|fr|[[Jeune \u00c9cole]]}} advocated building long-range and fast [[protected cruiser]]s for use as [[commerce raider]]s on foreign stations while a traditionalist faction preferred larger [[armored cruiser]]s and small fleet scouts, both of which were to operate as part of the main fleet in home waters. By the end of the decade and into the early 1890s, the traditionalists were ascendant, leading to the construction of several armored cruisers of the {{sclass-|Amiral Charner|cruiser|4}}, though the supporters of the {{lang|fr|Jeune \u00c9cole}} secured approval for one large cruiser built according to their ideas, which became ''D'Entrecasteaux''.{{sfn|Ropp|p=284}}\n\nA [[sister ship]] to ''D'Entrecasteaux'' was approved in 1895, but the new naval minister, [[\u00c9douard Lockroy]], cancelled the ship in early 1896 in favor of another armored cruiser without consulting the {{lang|fr|Conseil de Traveaux}} (Council of Works), which oversaw naval construction. Lockroy was replaced as naval minister in April 1896, and his successor, [[Armand Besnard]], attempted to secure parliamentary approval for another ''D'Entrecasteaux''-class cruiser, but the [[Chamber of Deputies (France)|Chamber of Deputies]] refused, ending the project.{{sfn|Ropp|pp=284, 286}}\n\n===General characteristics and machinery===\n[[File:D'Entrecasteaux Brasseys1902.png|thumb|left|Plan and profile drawing of ''D'Entrecasteaux'']]\n\n''D'Entrecasteaux'' was {{cvt|117|m|ftin}} [[long between perpendiculars]], with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{cvt|17.83|m|ftin}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{cvt|7.5|m|ftin}}. She [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{cvt|7995|LT|t|lk=on}}. Her [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] had a [[flush deck]] and a pronounced [[naval ram|ram bow]], and was sheathed in wood and a [[copper sheathing|copper layer]] to protect it from [[biofouling]] on long voyages overseas. As was typical for French warships of the period, she had a significant [[tumblehome]] shape.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=312}}\n\nThe ship proved to be poorly ventilated and thus very hot in service, necessitating cooling equipment in her [[magazine (artillery)|ammunition magazines]]. ''D'Entrecasteaux'' was fitted with a pair of light pole [[mast (sailing)|masts]] for observation and signalling purposes. Her [[superstructure]] was fairly minimal, consisting of a small [[conning tower]] and [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] structure forward and a smaller, secondary conning position aft. Her crew numbered 559&nbsp;officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=312}}\n\nThe ship's propulsion system consisted of a pair of vertical [[triple-expansion steam engine]]s driving two [[screw propeller]]s. Steam was provided by five coal-burning, double-ended [[fire-tube boiler]]s; four were placed further forward, ducting into two [[funnel (ship)|funnels]], and the fifth boiler was further aft, with its own funnel. Her machinery was rated to produce {{convert|14500|ihp|lk=on}} for a top speed of {{convert|19.2|kn|lk=in}}, her maximum speed reached during [[sea trials]] in 1899. Coal storage amounted to {{cvt|980|LT|t}}.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=312}}{{sfn|Leyland & Brassey|p=35}}\n\n===Armament and armor===\nThe ship was armed with a [[main battery]] of two {{cvt|240|mm}} 40-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] (cal.) M1893 guns, which were placed in single-[[gun turret]]s, one forward and one aft on the [[centerline (nautical)|centerline]]. These were supported by a [[battleship secondary armament|secondary battery]] of twelve {{cvt|140|mm}} 30-cal. guns, eight of which were carried in individual [[casemate]]s in the main deck. The other four were in [[gun shield]]-protected mounts on the upper deck. For close-range defense against [[torpedo boat]]s, she carried twelve [[QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss|{{cvt|47|mm}} 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns]] and six [[QF 1-pounder pom-pom|{{cvt|37|mm}} 1-pounder guns]]. She was also armed with two {{cvt|457|mm|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s in her hull below the [[waterline]].{{sfn|Gardiner|p=312}} \n\nArmor protection consisted of [[nickel steel]] armor. She had a curved armor deck that was {{cvt|55|mm}} thick on the flat portion. Toward the sides of the hull, it sloped downward to provide a measure of vertical protection and increased in thickness to {{cvt|100|mm|0}}. A second {{cvt|20|mm}} deck was above the flat portion of the main deck with a [[cofferdam]] connecting it to the main deck. The forward conning tower was protected by {{cvt|254|mm|0}} on the sides. ''D'Entrecasteaux''{{'}}s main battery turrets had 254&nbsp;mm on the sides, while the casemate guns received 55&nbsp;mm of protection; the gun shields for the upper deck guns were also 55&nbsp;mm thick.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=312}}\n\n== Service history==\n===French career===\n[[File:French cruiser D'Entrecasteaux underway.jpg|thumb|left|''D'Entrecasteaux'' underway during [[sea trials]] in 1898]]\n\n''D'Entrecasteaux'' was built at the {{lang|fr|[[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e]]}} shipyard in [[La Seyne-sur-Mer]]. She was [[keel laying|laid down]] in September 1894,{{sfn|Gardiner|p=310}} was [[ship launching|launched]] on 13 June 1896,{{sfn|Gardiner & Gray|p=193}} and after completing [[fitting-out]], began sea trials in 1898. During testing on 28 April, one of her boilers burst, scalding four stokers badly and delaying her completion by six months.{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=56}} The ship was completed in early 1899.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=310}} She was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 15 February and was immediately deployed to the Far East to join the {{lang|fr|Division navale d'Extr\u00eame-Orient et du Pacifique occidental}} (Naval Division of the Far East and Western Pacific) and serve as its [[flagship]]. After departing on 6 April, she reached [[Saigon]] in [[French Indochina]] on 12 May, where she joined the protected cruisers {{ship|French cruiser|Descartes||2}}, {{ship|French cruiser|Pascal||2}}, and {{ship|French cruiser|Jean Bart||2}}. [[Rear Admiral]] de Courejolles hoisted his flag aboard ''D'Entrecasteaux'' on 1 June and she thereafter embarked on a long voyage around East Asia, sailing as far north as [[Qing China|China]].{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=57}}\n\nShe took part in the colonialist response to the [[Boxer Uprising]] in China in 1900, joining in the [[Battle of the Taku Forts (1900)|Battle of the Taku Forts]] in June.{{sfn|Robinson|p=394}} During the bombardment, she suffered problems with her main battery guns' breech blocks and locking mechanisms. These deficiencies compelled ''D'Entrecasteaux''{{'}}s return to [[Toulon]] for repairs that lasted from January to June 1901. She then returned to East Asia, arriving in Saigon on 8 August. The ship spent the next four two in the region, taking cruises in Chinese and Japanese waters in 1901 and 1902 before returning to Toulon in 1903 for a major overhaul that lasted through 1905.{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=57}}\n\nAfter emerging from the shipyard, ''D'Entrecasteaux'' sailed on 25 November 1905 for French Indochina, by way of a brief assignment to the Indian Ocean command. She then moved to the Naval Division of the Far East and Western Pacific. On 15 August, she resumed flagship duties when Rear Admiral Boisse transferred from the protected cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Guichen|1897|2}}. The unit also included the armored cruisers {{ship|French cruiser|Bruix||2}} and {{ship|French cruiser|Dupetit-Thouars||2}}, the protected cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Alger||2}}, four [[gunboat]]s, and five [[destroyer]]s. ''D'Entrecasteaux'' served on the station for the next four years, and during this period, she was involved in the unsuccessful attempt to re-float the armored cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Chanzy||2}} on 20 May 1907, which had [[ship grounding|run aground]] off the coast of China. ''D'Entrecasteaux'' departed Saigon on 25 October 1909 to return to Toulon.{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=57}}\n\nThe French Navy considered converting ''D'Entrecasteaux'' into a [[training ship]] for [[naval cadet]]s following her return home in 1909 to replace the armored cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Jeanne d'Arc||2}}, but the plan came to nothing. She instead underwent an extensive overhaul that included repairs to her propulsion system and her hull. Cooling systems for her secondary battery magazines were also installed, along with improved fire-control systems, a new Barr & Stroud [[rangefinder]], and a [[wireless telegraphy]] compartment. Her torpedo tubes were also removed, as she had never used them. The ship was recommissioned on 1 January 1912 to serve as the flagship of the Training Division of the Mediterranean Squadron, flying the flag of Rear Admiral Sourrieu. In early 1914, the Navy considered using ''D'Entrecasteaux'' to replace the armored cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Pothuau||2}} as a gunnery training vessel, but the changes had not been made by the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August.{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=57}}\n\n====World War I====\n[[File:Entrecasteaux IMG 1551.jpg|thumb|Model of ''D'Entrecasteaux'']]\n\nAt the start of World War I in August 1914, ''D'Entrecasteaux'' was part of the {{lang|fr|Division sp\u00e9ciale}}, along with the old [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|French battleship|Jaur\u00e9guiberry||2}} and {{ship|French battleship|Charlemagne||2}} and ''Pothuau''. Both of the cruisers required refits before they would be ready for active service, which were completed by the end of the month. On 5 November, France and Britain declared war on the [[Ottoman Empire]], and ''D'Entrecasteaux'' was sent to the coast of [[Ottoman Syria]], arriving there on 29 November to join the {{lang|fr|Division de Syrie}} (Syrian Division) with the armored cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Amiral Charner||2}}. The two cruisers were tasked with patrolling the {{cvt|600|km}} length of coastline between [[Jaffa]] to [[Alexandretta]].{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|pp=218\u2013219, 233}}\n\n''D'Entrecasteaux'' was sent to [[Port Said]] at the northern entrance to the [[Suez Canal]] in January 1915 to reinforce the defenses there against an impending Ottoman attack. During this period, on 31 January, French naval forces in the region were reorganized as the 3<sup>''e''</sup> {{lang|fr|Escadre}} (3rd Squadron) and ''D'Entrecasteaux'' became the flagship of [[Vice Admiral]] [[Louis Dartige du Fournet]]. She and the old [[coastal defense ship]] {{ship|French ironclad|Requin||2}} played a critical role in defeating the Ottoman infantry in their assault on 3 February. Their gunfire broke up the advancing Ottoman columns and ''Requin'' silenced the Ottoman heavy artillery battery. ''D'Entrecasteaux'' fired a total of five 240&nbsp;mm shells and thirty-six 138&nbsp;mm rounds at a range of {{cvt|6300|to|6700|m}} in the course of the action. The next day, Dartige du Fournet transferred to the pre-dreadnought {{ship|French battleship|Saint Louis||2}}.{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=233}}\n\nOn 25 March, ''D'Entrecasteaux'' bombarded Ottoman positions in [[Gaza]]. Dartige du Fournet established a set of three patrol zones to cover the Syrian coast on 6 May, and ''D'Entrecasteaux'' was assigned to the first sector, which covered the area between the Suez Canal and [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]. The French declared a [[blockade]] of the coast on 25 June. The ship was detached for a refit in [[Brest, France|Brest]] late in the year. As additional forces arrived in the region, the French reorganized the squadron into two divisions, ''D'Entrecasteaux'' being assigned to the 2nd Division in November. She became the flagship of Rear Admiral de Spitz, though she did not arrive on the Syrian coast until 20 December.{{Sfn|Jordan & Caresse|pp=235\u2013246}}\n\nVice Admiral [[Frederic Moreau]], the squadron commander by early 1916, opposed continuing patrols of the Syrian coast, as Ottoman maritime traffic had essentially stopped and he could not justify the expenditure of coal. The sinking of ''Amiral Charner'' by a German [[U-boat]] on 8 February strengthened his position, and further patrols were curtailed. ''D'Entrecasteaux'' was again detached in March for another refit.{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=240}} After its conclusion, the ship was assigned to the Moroccan Naval Division, but on 14 September, the protected cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Lavoisier||2}} arrived in Tangier to relieve her.{{sfn|Meirat|p=22}} ''D'Entrecasteaux'' was sent to [[Ethiopia]] with ''Pothuau'' in October in response to unrest in the country, but pressure from Britain, which feared that France was trying to assert influence in the country, led the French to withdraw the cruisers.{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=240}}\n\nIn late 1916, Ottoman forces had made significant progress toward defeating the Arabs who had rebelled against Ottoman rule at the instigation of the British. Vice Admiral [[Rosslyn Wemyss, 1st Baron Wester Wemyss|Rosslyn Wemyss]] requested French assistance in the form of ''D'Entrecasteaux'' and ''Pothuau'', which the French Navy dispatched to the [[Red Sea]] to provide fire support to the beleaguered Arab forces. The two cruisers operated out of [[Port Suez]]; one was on station at either of the main Arab cities of [[Jeddah]] and [[Rabegh]] while the other replenished coal at Port Suez. On 11 February 1917, the cruisers were released from these duties, as the Arabs had secured their position and the cruisers were needed elsewhere. They were then sent to the [[Gulf of Aden]] to strengthen the vessels available for [[convoy]] escort in the Indian Ocean. They were joined there by the cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|D'Estr\u00e9es||2}} ''D'Entrecasteaux'' and ''D'Estr\u00e9es'' escorted convoys from Madagascar to [[Djibouti]] through May. ''D'Entrecasteaux'' was sent home for another refit in July, her place in the area eventually being taken by the cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Du Chayla||2}}.{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=247}}\n\n===Postwar career and service in the Belgian and Polish navies===\n''D'Entrecasteaux'' was sent to [[Durazzo]] and [[Cattaro]] on 25 January 1919 as part of the fleet that monitored the transfer of ex-[[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ships to the victorious [[Allies of World War I|Allied powers]]. She was later involved in the repatriation of elements of the {{lang|fr|[[Arm\u00e9e d'Orient (1915\u201319)|Arm\u00e9e d'Orient]]}} (Army of the East). On 2 July, the ship was placed in reserve at Brest and was decommissioned on 1 June 1921. She was struck from the [[naval register]] on 27 October 1922 and transferred temporarily to the [[Belgian Navy]] the following year, being towed to [[Zeebrugge]] on 24 May 1923. She was used as a [[depot ship]] for Belgian torpedo boats until early 1926, when the Belgians returned her. Significant reductions in the naval budget prevented them from being able to maintain her. The ship was towed to [[Cherbourg]] on 4 February, where she remained until 7 March 1927, when the French sold her to the [[Polish Navy]].{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=256}}{{sfn|Gardiner & Gray|pp=193\u2013194}}\n\nIn the early 1920s, the [[Polish Navy]] explored the possibility of buying a cruiser from France to strengthen the nascent Polish fleet. The naval command initially wanted a vessel that could be used as a [[submarine tender]] to support their submarines, but the early plans fell through.{{sfn|Twardowski|p=56}} After the Poles purchased ''D'Entrecasteaux'', she was renamed ''Kr\u00f3l W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV'' and was then towed to [[Gdynia]].{{sfn|Gardiner & Gray|p=194}}{{sfn|Neumann|p=213}} The [[Minister of National Defence (Poland)|Minister for Military Affairs]], Daniel Konarzewski, renamed her ''Ba\u0142tyk'' on 17 September 1927 as a result of the growing influence of royalist elements in the Polish parliament. By that time, the ship was armed with only six of her 47&nbsp;mm guns; plans in the late 1920s to rearm her with a battery of eight {{cvt|75|mm|0}} [[anti-aircraft gun]]s to use her as a floating anti-aircraft battery came to nothing due to fears that she would be too vulnerable to air attack. The vessel was instead used as a stationary training ship in Gdynia beginning in early 1929. She became the headquarters for the naval specialists school on 1 April 1930, and during this period, she served as the flagship of [[Commander]] [[J\u00f3zef Unrug]].{{sfn|Twardowski|pp=57\u201360}}\n\nDuring the [[German invasion of Poland]] that began on 1 September 1939, ''Ba\u0142tyk'' was hit by a bomb on her [[quarterdeck]], which started a small fire. Her crew remained aboard to help defend Gdynia from German [[bomber]]s before abandoning her on 11 September as she was a large target in the harbor. Her crew thereafter served ashore and saw action at the [[Battle of K\u0119pa Oksywska]]. German artillery bombarded the ship on 16\u201317 September, and on the 19th, German forces occupied the port and seized the ship. She was then used as a [[barracks ship]] by the Germans.{{sfn|Twardowski|pp=59\u201360}} The ship was ultimately [[ship breaking|broken up]] for scrap by the Germans by around 1942.{{sfn|Gardiner & Gray|p=194}}{{sfn|Neumann|p=213}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Friedman\n  | first = Norman\n  | authorlink=Norman Friedman\n  | year = 2011\n  | title = Naval Weapons of World War One: Guns, Torpedoes, Mines and ASW Weapons of All Nations; An Illustrated Directory\n  | publisher = Naval Institute Press\n  | location = Annapolis\n  | isbn = 978-1-84832-100-7\n  | ref ={{sfnRef|Friedman}}\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | editor1-last = Gardiner\n  | editor1-first = Robert\n  | year = 1979\n  | title = Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1860\u20131905\n  | publisher = Conway Maritime Press\n  | location = London\n  | isbn = 978-0-85177-133-5\n  | ref = {{sfnRef|Gardiner}}\n  | url-access = registration\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/conwaysallworlds0000unse_l2e2\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  |editor1-last=Gardiner\n  |editor1-first=Robert\n  |editor2-last=Gray\n  |editor2-first=Randal\n  |title=Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships: 1906\u20131921\n  |year=1985\n  |location=Annapolis\n  |publisher=Naval Institute Press\n  |isbn=0-87021-907-3\n  |lastauthoramp=y\n  | ref = {{sfnRef|Gardiner & Gray}}\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  |last1=Jordan\n  |first1=John\n  |last2=Caresse\n  |first2=Philippe\n  |title=French Armoured Cruisers 1887\u20131932\n  |date=2019\n  |publisher=Seaforth Publishing\n  |location=Barnsley\n  |isbn=978-1-5267-4118-9\n  |lastauthoramp=y\n  |ref={{sfnRef|Jordan & Caresse}}\n  }}\n* {{cite journal\n  |last1=Leyland\n  |first1=John\n  |last2=Brassey\n  |first2=Thomas A.\n  |title=Chapter II: The Progress of Foreign Navies\n  |journal=The Naval Annual\n  |year=1898\n  |location=Portsmouth\n  |publisher=J.

She was constructed at [[Forges et Chantiers de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e]], La Seyne. Created as [[protected cruiser]] and used as French [[flagship]] in the [[Far East]]. Polish school [[Hulk (ship type)|hulk]], altered from French [[cruiser]] ''D'Entrecasteaux'' in 1927. Largest warship in [[Second Polish Republic|Second Polish Republic's]] [[Polish Navy|Navy]] and the only cruiser in it. Scrapped in 1942 by [[Nazi Germany|Germans]].\n\n==Design==\nIn the mid-1880s, elements in the French naval command argued over future warship construction; the {{lang|fr|[[Jeune \u00c9cole]]}} advocated building long-range and fast [[protected cruiser]]s for use as [[commerce raider]]s on foreign stations while a traditionalist faction preferred larger [[armored cruiser]]s and small fleet scouts, both of which were to operate as part of the main fleet in home waters. By the end of the decade and into the early 1890s, the traditionalists were ascendant, leading to the construction of several armored cruisers of the {{sclass-|Amiral Charner|cruiser|4}}, though the supporters of the {{lang|fr|Jeune \u00c9cole}} secured approval for one large cruiser built according to their ideas, which became ''D'Entrecasteaux''.{{sfn|Ropp|p=284}}\n\nA [[sister ship]] to ''D'Entrecasteaux'' was approved in 1895, but the new naval minister, [[\u00c9douard Lockroy]], cancelled the ship in early 1896 in favor of another armored cruiser without consulting the {{lang|fr|Conseil de Traveaux}} (Council of Works), which oversaw naval construction. Lockroy was replaced as naval minister in April 1896, and his successor, [[Armand Besnard]], attempted to secure parliamentary approval for another ''D'Entrecasteaux''-class cruiser, but the [[Chamber of Deputies (France)|Chamber of Deputies]] refused, ending the project.{{sfn|Ropp|pp=284, 286}}\n\n===General characteristics and machinery===\n[[File:D'Entrecasteaux Brasseys1902.png|thumb|left|Plan and profile drawing of ''D'Entrecasteaux'']]\n\n''D'Entrecasteaux'' was {{cvt|117|m|ftin}} [[long between perpendiculars]], with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{cvt|17.83|m|ftin}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{cvt|7.5|m|ftin}}. She [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{cvt|7995|LT|t|lk=on}}. Her [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] had a [[flush deck]] and a pronounced [[naval ram|ram bow]], and was sheathed in wood and a [[copper sheathing|copper layer]] to protect it from [[biofouling]] on long voyages overseas. As was typical for French warships of the period, she had a significant [[tumblehome]] shape.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=312}}\n\nThe ship proved to be poorly ventilated and thus very hot in service, necessitating cooling equipment in her [[magazine (artillery)|ammunition magazines]]. ''D'Entrecasteaux'' was fitted with a pair of light pole [[mast (sailing)|masts]] for observation and signalling purposes. Her [[superstructure]] was fairly minimal, consisting of a small [[conning tower]] and [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] structure forward and a smaller, secondary conning position aft. Her crew numbered 559&nbsp;officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=312}}\n\nThe ship's propulsion system consisted of a pair of vertical [[triple-expansion steam engine]]s driving two [[screw propeller]]s. Steam was provided by five coal-burning, double-ended [[fire-tube boiler]]s; four were placed further forward, ducting into two [[funnel (ship)|funnels]], and the fifth boiler was further aft, with its own funnel. Her machinery was rated to produce {{convert|14500|ihp|lk=on}} for a top speed of {{convert|19.2|kn|lk=in}}, her maximum speed reached during [[sea trials]] in 1899. Coal storage amounted to {{cvt|980|LT|t}}.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=312}}{{sfn|Leyland & Brassey|p=35}}\n\n===Armament and armor===\nThe ship was armed with a [[main battery]] of two {{cvt|240|mm}} 40-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] (cal.) M1893 guns, which were placed in single-[[gun turret]]s, one forward and one aft on the [[centerline (nautical)|centerline]]. These were supported by a [[battleship secondary armament|secondary battery]] of twelve {{cvt|140|mm}} 30-cal. guns, eight of which were carried in individual [[casemate]]s in the main deck. The other four were in [[gun shield]]-protected mounts on the upper deck. For close-range defense against [[torpedo boat]]s, she carried twelve [[QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss|{{cvt|47|mm}} 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns]] and six [[QF 1-pounder pom-pom|{{cvt|37|mm}} 1-pounder guns]]. She was also armed with two {{cvt|457|mm|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s in her hull below the [[waterline]].{{sfn|Gardiner|p=312}} \n\nArmor protection consisted of [[nickel steel]] armor. She had a curved armor deck that was {{cvt|55|mm}} thick on the flat portion. Toward the sides of the hull, it sloped downward to provide a measure of vertical protection and increased in thickness to {{cvt|100|mm|0}}. A second {{cvt|20|mm}} deck was above the flat portion of the main deck with a [[cofferdam]] connecting it to the main deck. The forward conning tower was protected by {{cvt|254|mm|0}} on the sides. ''D'Entrecasteaux''{{'}}s main battery turrets had 254&nbsp;mm on the sides, while the casemate guns received 55&nbsp;mm of protection; the gun shields for the upper deck guns were also 55&nbsp;mm thick.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=312}}\n\n== Service history==\n===French career===\n[[File:French cruiser D'Entrecasteaux underway.jpg|thumb|left|''D'Entrecasteaux'' underway during [[sea trials]] in 1898]]\n\n''D'Entrecasteaux'' was built at the {{lang|fr|[[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e]]}} shipyard in [[La Seyne-sur-Mer]]. She was [[keel laying|laid down]] in September 1894,{{sfn|Gardiner|p=310}} was [[ship launching|launched]] on 13 June 1896,{{sfn|Gardiner & Gray|p=193}} and after completing [[fitting-out]], began sea trials in 1898. During testing on 28 April, one of her boilers burst, scalding four stokers badly and delaying her completion by six months.{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=56}} The ship was completed in early 1899.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=310}} She was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 15 February and was immediately deployed to the Far East to join the {{lang|fr|Division navale d'Extr\u00eame-Orient et du Pacifique occidental}} (Naval Division of the Far East and Western Pacific) and serve as its [[flagship]]. After departing on 6 April, she reached [[Saigon]] in [[French Indochina]] on 12 May, where she joined the protected cruisers {{ship|French cruiser|Descartes||2}}, {{ship|French cruiser|Pascal||2}}, and {{ship|French cruiser|Jean Bart||2}}. [[Rear Admiral]] de Courejolles hoisted his flag aboard ''D'Entrecasteaux'' on 1 June and she thereafter embarked on a long voyage around East Asia, sailing as far north as [[Qing China|China]].{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=57}}\n\nShe took part in the colonialist response to the [[Boxer Uprising]] in China in 1900, joining in the [[Battle of the Taku Forts (1900)|Battle of the Taku Forts]] in June.{{sfn|Robinson|p=394}} During the bombardment, she suffered problems with her main battery guns' breech blocks and locking mechanisms. These deficiencies compelled ''D'Entrecasteaux''{{'}}s return to [[Toulon]] for repairs that lasted from January to June 1901. She then returned to East Asia, arriving in Saigon on 8 August. The ship spent the next four two in the region, taking cruises in Chinese and Japanese waters in 1901 and 1902 before returning to Toulon in 1903 for a major overhaul that lasted through 1905.{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=57}}\n\nAfter emerging from the shipyard, ''D'Entrecasteaux'' sailed on 25 November 1905 for French Indochina, by way of a brief assignment to the Indian Ocean command. She then moved to the Naval Division of the Far East and Western Pacific. On 15 August, she resumed flagship duties when Rear Admiral Boisse transferred from the protected cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Guichen|1897|2}}. The unit also included the armored cruisers {{ship|French cruiser|Bruix||2}} and {{ship|French cruiser|Dupetit-Thouars||2}}, the protected cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Alger||2}}, four [[gunboat]]s, and five [[destroyer]]s. ''D'Entrecasteaux'' served on the station for the next four years, and during this period, she was involved in the unsuccessful attempt to re-float the armored cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Chanzy||2}} on 20 May 1907, which had [[ship grounding|run aground]] off the coast of China. ''D'Entrecasteaux'' departed Saigon on 25 October 1909 to return to Toulon.{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=57}}\n\nThe French Navy considered converting ''D'Entrecasteaux'' into a [[training ship]] for [[naval cadet]]s following her return home in 1909 to replace the armored cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Jeanne d'Arc||2}}, but the plan came to nothing. She instead underwent an extensive overhaul that included repairs to her propulsion system and her hull. Cooling systems for her secondary battery magazines were also installed, along with improved fire-control systems, a new Barr & Stroud [[rangefinder]], and a [[wireless telegraphy]] comparment. Her torpedo tubes were also removed, as she had never used them. The ship was recommissioned on 1 January 1912 to serve as the flagship of the Training Division of the Mediterranean Squadron, flying the flag of Rear Admiral Sourrieu. In early 1914, the Navy considered using ''D'Entrecasteaux'' to replace the armored cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Pothuau||2}} as a gunnery training vessel, but the changes had not been made by the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August.{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=57}}\n\n====World War I====\n[[File:Entrecasteaux IMG 1551.jpg|thumb|Model of ''D'Entrecasteaux'']]\n\nAt the start of World War I in August 1914, ''D'Entrecasteaux'' was part of the {{lang|fr|Division sp\u00e9ciale}}, along with the old [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s {{ship|French battleship|Jaur\u00e9guiberry||2}} and {{ship|French battleship|Charlemagne||2}} and ''Pothuau''. Both of the cruisers required refits before they would be ready for active service, which were completed by the end of the month. On 5 November, France and Britain declared war on the [[Ottoman Empire]], and ''D'Entrecasteaux'' was sent to the coast of [[Ottoman Syria]], arriving there on 29 November to join the {{lang|fr|Division de Syrie}} (Syrian Division) with the armored cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Amiral Charner||2}}. The two cruisers were tasked with patrolling the {{cvt|600|km}} length of coastline between [[Jaffa]] to [[Alexandretta]].{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|pp=218\u2013219, 233}}\n\n''D'Entrecasteaux'' was sent to [[Port Said]] at the northern entrance to the [[Suez Canal]] in January 1915 to reinforce the defenses there against an impending Ottoman attack. During this period, on 31 January, French naval forces in the region were reorganized as the 3<sup>''e''</sup> {{lang|fr|Escadre}} (3rd Squadron) and ''D'Entrecasteaux'' became the flagship of [[Vice Admiral]] [[Louis Dartige du Fournet]]. She and the old [[coastal defense ship]] {{ship|French ironclad|Requin||2}} played a critical role in defeating the Ottoman infantry in their assault on 3 February. Their gunfire broke up the advancing Ottoman columns and ''Requin'' silenced the Ottoman heavy artillery battery. ''D'Entrecasteaux'' fired a total of five 240&nbsp;mm shells and thirty-six 138&nbsp;mm rounds at a range of {{cvt|6300|to|6700|m}} in the course of the action. The next day, Dartige du Fournet transferred to the pre-dreadnought {{ship|French battleship|Saint Louis||2}}.{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=233}}\n\nOn 25 March, ''D'Entrecasteaux'' bombarded Ottoman positions in [[Gaza]]. Dartige du Fournet established a set of three patrol zones to cover the Syrian coast on 6 May, and ''D'Entrecasteaux'' was assigned to the first sector, which covered the area between the Suez Canal and [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]. The French declared a [[blockade]] of the coast on 25 June. The ship was detached for a refit in [[Brest, France|Brest]] late in the year. As additional forces arrived in the region, the French reorganized the squadron into two divisions, ''D'Entrecasteaux'' being assigned to the 2nd Division in November. She became the flagship of Rear Admiral de Spitz, though she did not arrive on the Syrian coast until 20 December.{{Sfn|Jordan & Caresse|pp=235\u2013246}}\n\nVice Admiral [[Frederic Moreau]], the squadron commander by early 1916, opposed continuing patrols of the Syrian coast, as Ottoman maritime traffic had essentially stopped and he could not justify the expenditure of coal. The sinking of ''Amiral Charner'' by a German [[U-boat]] on 8 February strengthened his position, and further patrols were curtailed. ''D'Entrecasteaux'' was again detached in March for another refit.{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=240}} After its conclusion, the ship was assigned to the Moroccan Naval Division, but on 14 September, the protected cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Lavoisier||2}} arrived in Tangier to relieve her.{{sfn|Meirat|p=22}} ''D'Entrecasteaux'' was sent to [[Ethiopia]] with ''Pothuau'' in October in response to unrest in the country, but pressure from Britain, which feared that France was trying to assert influence in the country, led the French to withdraw the cruisers.{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=240}}\n\nIn late 1916, Ottoman forces had made significant progress toward defeating the Arabs who had rebelled against Ottoman rule at the instigation of the British. Vice Admiral [[Rosslyn Wemyss, 1st Baron Wester Wemyss|Rosslyn Wemyss]] requested French assistance in the form of ''D'Entrecasteaux'' and ''Pothuau'', which the French Navy dispatched to the [[Red Sea]] to provide fire support to the beleaguered Arab forces. The two cruisers operated out of [[Port Suez]]; one was on station at either of the main Arab cities of [[Jeddah]] and [[Rabegh]] while the other replenished coal at Port Suez. On 11 February 1917, the cruisers were released from these duties, as the Arabs had secured their position and the cruisers were needed elsewhere. They were then sent to the [[Gulf of Aden]] to strengthen the vessels available for [[convoy]] escort in the Indian Ocean. They were joined there by the cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|D'Estr\u00e9es||2}} ''D'Entrecasteaux'' and ''D'Estr\u00e9es'' escorted convoys from Madagascar to [[Djibouti]] through May. ''D'Entrecasteaux'' was sent home for another refit in July, her place in the area eventually being taken by the cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Du Chayla||2}}.{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=247}}\n\n===Postwar career and service in the Belgian and Polish navies===\n''D'Entrecasteaux'' was sent to [[Durazzo]] and [[Cattaro]] on 25 January 1919 as part of the fleet that monitored the transfer of ex-[[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ships to the victorious [[Allies of World War I|Allied powers]]. She was later involved in the repatriation of elements of the {{lang|fr|[[Arm\u00e9e d'Orient (1915\u201319)|Arm\u00e9e d'Orient]]}} (Army of the East). On 2 July, the ship was placed in reserve at Brest and was decommissioned on 1 June 1921. She was struck from the [[naval register]] on 27 October 1922 and transferred temporarily to the [[Belgian Navy]] the following year, being towed to [[Zeebrugge]] on 24 May 1923. She was used as a [[depot ship]] for Belgian torpedo boats until early 1926, when the Belgians returned her. Significant reductions in the naval budget prevented them from being able to maintain her. The ship was towed to [[Cherbourg]] on 4 February, where she remained until 7 March 1927, when the French sold her to the [[Polish Navy]].{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=256}}{{sfn|Gardiner & Gray|pp=193\u2013194}}\n\nIn the early 1920s, the [[Polish Navy]] explored the possibility of buying a cruiser from France to strengthen the nascent Polish fleet. The naval command initially wanted a vessel that could be used as a [[submarine tender]] to support their submarines, but the early plans fell through.{{sfn|Twardowski|p=56}} After the Poles purchased ''D'Entrecasteaux'', she was renamed ''Kr\u00f3l W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV'' and was then towed to [[Gdynia]].{{sfn|Gardiner & Gray|p=194}}{{sfn|Neumann|p=213}} The [[Minister of National Defence (Poland)|Minister for Military Affairs]], Daniel Konarzewski, renamed her ''Ba\u0142tyk'' on 17 September 1927 as a result of the growing influence of royalist elements in the Polish parliament. By that time, the ship was armed with only six of her 47&nbsp;mm guns; plans in the late 1920s to rearm her with a battery of eight {{cvt|75|mm|0}} [[anti-aircraft gun]]s to use her as a floating anti-aircraft battery came to nothing due to fears that she would be too vulnerable to air attack. The vessel was instead used as a stationary training ship in Gdynia beginning in early 1929. She became the headquarters for the naval specialists school on 1 April 1930, and during this period, she served as the flagship of [[Commander]] [[J\u00f3zef Unrug]].{{sfn|Twardowski|pp=57\u201360}}\n\nDuring the [[German invasion of Poland]] that began on 1 September 1939, ''Ba\u0142tyk'' was hit by a bomb on her [[quarterdeck]], which started a small fire. Her crew remained aboard to help defend Gdynia from German [[bomber]]s before abandoning her on 11 September as she was a large target in the harbor. Her crew thereafter served ashore and saw action at the [[Battle of K\u0119pa Oksywska]]. German artillery bombarded the ship on 16\u201317 September, and on the 19th, German forces occupied the port and seized the ship. She was then used as a [[barracks ship]] by the Germans.{{sfn|Twardowski|pp=59\u201360}} The ship was ultimately [[ship breaking|broken up]] for scrap by the Germans by around 1942.{{sfn|Gardiner & Gray|p=194}}{{sfn|Neumann|p=213}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Friedman\n  | first = Norman\n  | authorlink=Norman Friedman\n  | year = 2011\n  | title = Naval Weapons of World War One: Guns, Torpedoes, Mines and ASW Weapons of All Nations; An Illustrated Directory\n  | publisher = Naval Institute Press\n  | location = Annapolis\n  | isbn = 978-1-84832-100-7\n  | ref ={{sfnRef|Friedman}}\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | editor1-last = Gardiner\n  | editor1-first = Robert\n  | year = 1979\n  | title = Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1860\u20131905\n  | publisher = Conway Maritime Press\n  | location = London\n  | isbn = 978-0-85177-133-5\n  | ref = {{sfnRef|Gardiner}}\n  | url-access = registration\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/conwaysallworlds0000unse_l2e2\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  |editor1-last=Gardiner\n  |editor1-first=Robert\n  |editor2-last=Gray\n  |editor2-first=Randal\n  |title=Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships: 1906\u20131921\n  |year=1985\n  |location=Annapolis\n  |publisher=Naval Institute Press\n  |isbn=0-87021-907-3\n  |lastauthoramp=y\n  | ref = {{sfnRef|Gardiner & Gray}}\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  |last1=Jordan\n  |first1=John\n  |last2=Caresse\n  |first2=Philippe\n  |title=French Armoured Cruisers 1887\u20131932\n  |date=2019\n  |publisher=Seaforth Publishing\n  |location=Barnsley\n  |isbn=978-1-5267-4118-9\n  |lastauthoramp=y\n  |ref={{sfnRef|Jordan & Caresse}}\n  }}\n* {{cite journal\n  |last1=Leyland\n  |first1=John\n  |last2=Brassey\n  |first2=Thomas A.\n  |title=Chapter II: The Progress of Foreign Navies\n  |journal=The Naval Annual\n  |year=1898\n  |location=Portsmouth\n  |publisher=J.

Based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the unit was authorized on September 15, 1915, as an exclusively Canadian Grenadier Guards (CGG) formation with Guards uniforms and accoutrements approved by The [[Governor General of Canada]], HRH, Duke of Connaught (Colonel of the Canadian Grenadier Guards). Mobilization and recruiting for soldiers began on October 23, 1915.   \n  \nMore than 4,213 men served in the 87th Battalion, representing all regions of Canada, but predominantly Ontario, until&nbsp; the last few months of the&nbsp; war&nbsp; when the balance was furnished by soldiers from Quebec (included the need to form a&nbsp; francophone coy.) The Battalion earned 17  Battle Honours at a cost&nbsp; of 886 dead & 2,246 wounded, many of them wounded multiple times.  \n[[File:87th Battalion badges.jpg|thumb|Badges of the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF - Hayes-Rivet (MHR) collection]]\n\n== Unit distinctions & achievements ==\nThe 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF holds several distinctions in compared to other CEF battalions:\n* CGG was one of only 7 Militia Regiments (out of 51 CEF units) to recruit their own battalions that fought as a distinct unit within the Canadian Corps.\n* The 87th Battalion was one of only 3 Canadian units authorized by the Minister of Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, to recruit across all of Canada. The other 2 were the [[Royal Canadian Regiment]] and [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]].\n* The 87th Battalion was the only Canadian Foot Guards CEF unit active during The Great War. The Governor Generals Foot Guards (GGFG) contributed volunteers for the 2nd Battalion (Eastern Ontario Regiment), CEF, and the 77th Battalion CEF (Ottawa), CEF. The Governor Generals Horse Guards (GGHG) contributed men for the 4th and 7th Canadian Mounted Rifles (Bantams) CEF, but these were composite or regional units (more on that later) and none bore the title or accoutrements of Guards.\n* Title of 'Guardsman' was awarded by [[King George V]] in 1919 as a permanent distinction in conjunction with all other Guards units, in recognition of their collective contributions to victory in the Great War.\n* 87th Battalion were the first to liberate Belgium on 5 November, 1918. Patrols from the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards), of the 4th Division, crossed the River Aunelle, thereby marking the liberation, by the Canadians, of the first part of occupied Belgium.\n\n== Unit milestones ==\n=== Mobilization and England ===\nThe 87th Battalion departed Canada after boarding R.M.S. [[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|''Empress of Britain'']] on April 23, 1916 and arrived in Liverpool, England on May 5, 1916. The battalion arrived and billeted on May 27 at Bramshott Military Camp as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade (until June 1916) and then designated as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in August of the same year. During the period in England, the battalion received training from an officer and four drill sergeants from the British Grenadier Guards, all trench veterans, all previously wounded in action (WIA). On August 11/12, the battalion crossed over to France and landed at Le Havre, France on August 13, 1916 with a total strength of 1,090 all ranks. The battalion served the duration of the war as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Infantry Division.\n\n=== First Actions & casualties ===\nFollowing the [[Battle of Mont Sorrel]], 303 members of the 87th Battalion were detached to reinforce the [[1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment), CEF]]. Of these CGG members, two, 177281 Private John Leitch, (later KIA 9 April, 1917), and 178218 Private William Anson Ogilvie, would distinguish themselves with the 1st Battalion during the Battle of the Somme and win multiple Military Medals for bravery in the field. The initial loss of men were replaced by 391 officers & men from the 77th, Battalion, (Ottawa) CEF, from the GGFG. The battalion was introduced and indoctrinated into trench warfare beginning August 18, 1916 in the Ypres area. Their first casualties, two wounded, occurred that same day. The first 87th Battalion fatality occurred on August 26, 1916. Total casualties for the first weeks of the war were eventually 17 KIA / 25 WIA. On September 16, 1916, the 87th battalion participated in their first trench raid resulting in 36 casualties out of 60 engaged unit members.\n\n===  Battle of the Somme ===\nOn 10 October, 1916, the 87th Battalion was relocated to Albert area along the Ancre area and on the 21 October, attacked and took a section of Regina Trench. The first gallantry awards earned by the 87th Battalion were awarded to four members for the attack on Regina Trench, CSM W. Blaney, Sgt. J.C. Noon, Ptes J.E. Blaney, and J.D. Hunter. After some routine activities and tours along the front, on November 18, the 87th Battalion was assigned to capture a section of Desire Trench, as well as its support systems. The attack was launched from Regina Trench. It succeeded well beyond expectations, and in addition to capturing Desire, Major Franklin Hall, with 41 volunteers, with only their rifles, bayonets, grenades and 2 Lewis Guns advanced a further 500 yards and captured part of Grandcourt Trench, including taking 115 prisoners. 80 of these were taken unaided by four privates; Roy, Thompson, Garneau and Winke.  \n[[File:Plan of Attack Vimy Ridge.jpg|thumb|87th Battalion was to advance as part of the 11th Brigage, 4th Division. (2nd from top) Plan of Attack for Vimy Ridge 9 April 1917]]\n\n=== Battle of Vimy Ridge ===\nThe Battle of Vimy Ridge was a terrible tragedy for the battalion. Progress on the right was slow because, for a time and in part, the centre had practically collapsed.The 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) were in the first wave but for some reason, a section of enemy trench barely a hundred metres in front of them had been left untouched by the artillery bombardment. (it has been suggested that the 87th Battalion commanding officer, Major Harold Leroy Shaw wanted to use it as a first-aid station and battalion headquarters later on.) Subsequently,the company assaulting it was virtually wiped out in just six minutes, and \u2018sixty per cent of its strength lay dead on the ground.\u2019It was not a good beginning, delaying the other guardsmen so that they lost the barrage, and those who tried to continue the advance were cut down by German machine gunners firing from positions of relative safety in the untouched trenches.   \n\nThe 87th Battalion War diaries reports that six of the seven officers leading the 87th into battle were killed or wounded within the first hours. \"Word had been received that Captain Harry Sare, (Officer Commanding the Assault), had been shot through the head with a bullet and could no longer carry on. Lieutenant Yonkles had also been hit in the left arm, Majors Joy and Ross and Lieut. Savage had been killed, and Lieut.

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of his generation and was inducted into the [[English Football Hall of Fame]] in 2002.\n\nBorn in [[Birkenhead]], he began his career at his hometown club [[Tranmere Rovers]] before moving on to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], the club he had supported as a child. He was particularly known for scoring goals with his head and being a pedo. Dean played the majority of his career at Everton before injuries caught up with him and he moved on to new challenges at [[Notts County]]. He is best known for his exploits during the 1927\u201328 season, which saw him score a record 60 league goals. He also scored 18 goals in 16 appearances for England.\n\nA statue of Dean was unveiled outside [[Goodison Park]] in May 2001. A year later, he became one of 22 players inducted into the inaugural [[English Football Hall of Fame]]. Dean was the first Everton player to wear the number-9 shirt, which in later years would become iconic at the club.\n\n==Early years==\nDean was born at 313 Laird Street in [[Birkenhead]], [[Cheshire]], across the [[River Mersey]] from [[Liverpool]]. Dean's family on both sides hailed from [[Chester]]. He was the grandson of Ralph Brett, a train driver who drove the royal train during the reign of [[George V]]. Dean grew up as a supporter of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] thanks to the efforts of his father, William Sr., who took him to a match during the 1914\u20131915 title-winning season.\n\nDean's childhood coincided with the [[World War I|First World War]], and between the ages of 7 and 11 he delivered cow's milk to local families as part of the \"war effort: \"Well, it was war time you see, so you were grafting all the time. I used to take milk out. I'd be up at half-past four in the morning and go down and get the ponies and the milk floats, then I'd come out to this place in Upton, between [[Upton, Merseyside|Upton]] and [[Arrowe Park]], and Burgess' Farm was there. We used to collect the milk in the big urns and take it out to people's houses, serving it out of the ladle. And not only that, you had an allotment, and that was in school time. And there was no such thing as pinching and stealing and all that bloody caper. In those days, you were growing all that stuff and you needed it for the war time.\"<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingintelligence.com/2010/03/09/dixie-dean-i-never-had-any-lessons-at-school-no-maths-no-english-nothing-except-football/|title=Interview with John Roberts|last=Roberts|first=John|publisher=SportingIntelligence.com|accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nDean attended Laird Street School,{{sfn|Keith|2003|p=10}} but felt he received no formal education: \"My only lesson was football&nbsp;... I used to give the pens out on Friday afternoons&nbsp;... the ink, and the chalks. That was the only job I had in school&nbsp;... I never had any lessons.\"<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> When he turned 11 he attended Albert (Memorial) Industrial School, a [[borstal]] school in Birkenhead, because of the football facilities on offer. The Dean family home had little room for him due to the family's size; Dean was happy with the arrangement, since he could play on the school's football team.{{sfn|Keith|2003|p=10}} Dean falsely told fellow pupils he had been caught stealing, since he wanted to be \"one of the boys\".{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nHe left school at 14 and worked for [[Wirral Railway]] as an apprentice fitter; his father also worked there, and had been working since he was 11 years old<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> for [[Great Western Railway]]. The elder Dean later became a train driver before moving to Birkenhead to work for Wirral Railway, to be closer to his future wife (and William Jr.'s mother) Sarah. Dean's father would later retire with the company.{{sfn|Keith|2003|p=10}}\n\nDean took a night job so that he could concentrate on his first love, football: \"The other two apprentice fitters, they didn't like the night job because there were too many bloody rats around there, coming out of the Anglo-Oil company and the Vacuum Oil Company &nbsp;... rats as big as whippets. So I took their night job, and of course, I could always have a game of football then.\"<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> Dean would kick the trespassing rats against the wall.\n\nThe sons of Dean's manager at Wirral Railway were directors of [[New Brighton A.F.C.]], and they were interested in signing Dean. However, Dean told the club he was not interested in signing and instead played for local team Pensby United in [[Pensby, Merseyside|Pensby]]. It was at Pensby United where Dean attracted the attention of a Tranmere Rovers scout.<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/>\n\n===\"Dixie\" nickname===\nSome said that Dean and his family disliked his nickname, and preferred people to call him \"Bill\" or \"Billy\". The popular theory regarding how Dean acquired his nickname is that he did so in his youth, perhaps due to his dark complexion and hair (which bore a resemblance to people from the [[Southern United States]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/everton-fc/everton-dixie-dean/2007/01/23/footballing-world-wakes-up-to-dixie-100252-18518223/2/|title=Footballing world wakes up to Dixie|last=Prentice|first=David|date=23 January 2007|work=Liverpool Echo|accessdate=10 June 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In Dean's obituary in ''[[The Times]]'', [[Geoffrey Green]] suggested that the nickname was taken from a \"Dixie\" song that was popular during Dean's childhood; there was \"something of the [[Uncle Tom]] about his features\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Mr Dixie Dean|last=Green|first=Geoffrey|work=The Times|page=16}}</ref>\n\nAlternatively, Tranmere Rovers club historian Gilbert Upton uncovered evidence, verified by Dean's late Godmother, that the name \"Dixie\" was a corruption of his childhood nickname, Digsy (acquired from his approach to the children's game of tag, where Dean would dig his fist into a girl's back\u2014 hence \"Digsy\").{{sfn|Upton|1992}}\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Tranmere Rovers===\nHe played football for Laird Street School, Moreton Bible Class, Heswell and Pensby United. He then joined the pro ranks with his local club, [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] in November 1923. He was 16 at the time.\n\nWhilst at Tranmere, he was on the receiving end of a tough challenge which resulted in him losing a [[testicle]] in a reserve game against [[Altrincham F.C.|Altrincham]].{{sfn|Keith|2003|p=8}}<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/may/18/seven-sins-football-wrath-part-two|title=The seven deadly sins of football: Wrath&nbsp;\u2013 From Big Jack Charlton to the fan's hand grenade at Millwall |date=18 May 2009|work=The Guardian|accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref> Immediately following the challenge, a teammate rubbed the area to ease the pain. Dean shouted \"Don't rub 'em, count 'em!\".{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nIn his 16 months at Tranmere spanning seasons 1923/24 and 1924/25 he scored 27 goals in 30 league appearances. All 27 were in the second of those two seasons in which he averaged exactly a goal per game. His exploits attracted the interest of many clubs across England, including [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> Upon leaving Tranmere Rovers, secretary [[Bert Cooke]] reneged on an agreement to pay 10 percent of the transfer fee to Dean. Dean was paid one percent of the fee, which he gave to his parents (who donated it to [[Birkenhead General Hospital]]).\n\n===Everton===\nHis father had taken him to a league game at [[Goodison Park]] when he was eight years old. It was a dream come true for Dean when Everton secretary [[Thomas H. McIntosh]] arranged to meet him at the Woodside Hotel in 1925. Dean was so excited that he ran the {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} distance from his home in north Birkenhead to the riverside to meet him.<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> He signed for Everton in March 1925 having just turned 18.\n\nHe later revealed that he expected a \u00a3300 signing fee to be given to his parents when he transferred to Everton. They received only \u00a330, and Tranmere Rovers manager Bert Cooke told him \"that's all the League will allow\". Dean appealed to John McKenna, chairman of [[the Football Association]], but was told \"I'm afraid you've signed, and that's it.\"<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> Dean signed for Everton for \u00a33,000, then a record fee received for Tranmere Rovers. He made an immediate impact, scoring 32 goals in his first full season. A motorcycling accident at [[Holywell, Flintshire|Holywell]], [[North Wales]] in summer 1926 left Dean with a fractured skull and jaw, and doctors were unsure whether he would be able to play again. In his next game for Everton he scored using his head, leading Evertonians to joke that the doctor left a metal plate in Dean's head.\n\nDean's greatest point of note is that he is still the only player in English football to score 60 league goals in one season ([[1927-28 in English football|1927\u201328]]).<ref name=\"English League Leading Goalscorers 1889-2007\">{{cite web\n| title = English League Leading Goalscorers 1889\u20132007\n| url = http://rsssf.com/tablese/engtops.html\n| publisher = RSSSF\n| accessdate =14 August 2007}}</ref> At that season's end he was 21 years old. Middlesbrough's [[George Camsell]], who holds the highest goals-to-games ratio for England, had scored 59 league goals the previous season, although this was in the Second Division.\n\nIn that 1927-28 season Everton won the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] title. When they were relegated to [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in 1930 Dean stayed with them. The club went on to immediately win the Second Division in [[1930-31 in English football|1931]], followed by the First Division again in [[1931-32 in English football|1932]]. They then immediately won the [[FA Cup]] in [[1933 FA Cup Final|1933]] (in which he scored in the [[1933 FA Cup Final|final]]) \u2013 a sequence unmatched since.\n\nIn December 1933, Dean issued a public appeal to have stolen goods returned to him. ''[[The Times]]'' issued a statement: \"Dixie Dean, the Everton and England forward appeals to the thief who robbed him of an international cap and presentation clock to return them. His house in Caldy Road, Walton, Liverpool was entered in his absence over Christmas, and the thief left behind gold watches and jewelry (sic).\"<ref>{{cite news|title=News in brief|date=30 December 1933|work=The Times|page=7}}</ref> By then, Dean was captain of the side. However, the harsh physical demands of the game (as it was played then) took their toll and he was dropped from the first team in 1937.\n\n===Notts County===\nDean went on to play for [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] for one season, in which he scored three goals in nine games.\n\n===Sligo Rovers===\nAt age 32, Dean signed for Irish team Sligo Rovers in January 1939 to help the club in their FAI Cup campaign. On his arrival, the Railway station in [[Sligo]] was said to be filled with locals trying to catch a glimpse of him. Dean scored ten goals in seven games for the club,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/amateur-football/2009/12/09/the-cameo-that-shaped-seamus-100252-25354309/|title=The cameo that shaped Seamus|last=Randles|first=Dave|date=9 December 2009|publisher=Liverpool Echo|accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref> including five in a 7\u20131 win over [[Waterford F.C.|Waterford]] (which remains a club record for the most goals scored in a single game). He also played in four Cup matches, scoring once (in the 1\u20131 final against [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]], who won the replay 1\u20130). Dean's runner-up medal was later stolen from his hotel room; on a return trip to Ireland to watch Rovers 39 years later in the 1978 [[FAI Cup]] final, a package was delivered to his hotel room with the medal inside.\n\n===Hurst===\nDean ended his professional playing days with [[Ashton United F.C.|Hurst]] (now [[Ashton United F.C.|Ashton United]]) in the [[Cheshire County League]] 1939\u201340 season, managing two games (and one goal) before the outbreak of war truncated his career. He made his debut in a 4\u20130 loss to [[Stalybridge Celtic F.C.|Stalybridge Celtic]]; 5,600 people attended the game, paying sixpence, earning the club gate receipts of \u00a3140.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ashtonutd.com/dixiedean.htm|title=Dixie Dean|publisher=Ashton United|accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n==International career==\nDean made his d\u00e9but for the [[England national football team]] against British rivals Wales at the [[Racecourse Ground]] in [[Wrexham]] in February 1927, less than a month after his 20th birthday. His final game for England came in a 1\u20130 victory over Ireland in October 1932 at [[Blackpool F.C.]]'s [[Bloomfield Road]], when Dean was 25 years old.\n\nDean was involved in the [[1927 British Home Championship|1927]] and [[1929 British Home Championship|1929]] editions of the [[British Home Championship]]. During the 1927 edition, Dean scored four goals in his two games for England and scored twice against Scotland at Hampden Park. Despite the loss, the Scots won the competition overall and applauded Dean (who finished the tournament as top scorer). In the 1929 edition, he scored in his only outing against Ireland at Goodison Park.\n\nThe only international competitions outside the British Home Championship during Dean's international career were the 1928 and 1936 Olympic Games and the inaugural [[FIFA World Cup]], which took place in [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]]; however, neither [[Great Britain national football team|Great Britain]] nor England participated. Dean represented England 16 times, scoring 18 goals in 8 games (including [[hat-trick]]s against Belgium and Luxembourg).\n\n[[Image:dixie-dean-wix-cigarettes.png|thumb|150px|right|alt=Dean. arms folded, in 1928 Wix Cigarettes newspaper advertisement|Dean in 1928 newspaper advertisement for Wix Cigarettes]]\n\n==Personal life and post-football career==\nDean became a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] in 1931 while playing for Everton and England. He was initiated in Randle Holme Lodge, No. 3261 on 18 February 1931 in Birkenhead,The Wirral.<ref>Article \"The Beautiful Game\" by Patrick Kidd and Matthew Scanlan, published in \"Freemasonry Today,\" No.11, Summer 2010</ref>\n\nAfter retiring, he went on to run the Dublin Packet [[public house|pub]] in [[Chester]] (Everton and the Dublin Packet commemorate this with memorabilia) and work at [[Littlewoods]] [[football pools]] as a porter at their Walton Hall Avenue offices (where he was remembered by fellow workers as a quiet, unassuming man).\n\n==Declining health and death==\n\nIn January 1972, Dean was admitted to St. Catherine's hospital in Birkenhead suffering from the effects of [[influenza]]<ref>{{cite news|title=News in brief|date=20 January 1972|work=The Times|page=2}}</ref> and was released a month later.<ref>{{cite news|title=News in brief|date=21 February 1972|work=The Times|page=4}}</ref> In November 1976, he had his right leg amputated due to a [[thrombosis|blood clot]]; Dean's health was declining, and he became increasingly homebound.\n\nDean died on 1 March 1980 at age 73 after suffering a [[heart attack]] at Everton's home ground [[Goodison Park]] whilst watching a match against their closest rivals, [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].

March 1980) was an English [[association football|footballer]] who played as a centre forward. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of his generation and was inducted into the [[English Football Hall of Fame]] in 2002.\n\nBorn in [[Birkenhead]], he began his career at his hometown club [[Tranmere Rovers]] before moving on to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], the club he had supported as a child. He was particularly known for scoring goals with his head. Dean played the majority of his career at Everton before injuries caught up with him and he moved on to new challenges at [[Notts County]]. He is best known for his exploits during the 1927\u201328 season, which saw him score a record 60 league goals. He also scored 18 goals in 16 appearances for England.\n\nA statue of Dean was unveiled outside [[Goodison Park]] in May 2001. A year later, he became one of 22 players inducted into the inaugural [[English Football Hall of Fame]]. Dean was the first Everton player to wear the number-9 shirt, which in later years would become iconic at the club.\n\n==Early years==\nDean was born at 313 Laird Street in [[Birkenhead]], [[Cheshire]], across the [[River Mersey]] from [[Liverpool]]. Dean's family on both sides hailed from [[Chester]]. He was the grandson of Ralph Brett, a train driver who drove the royal train during the reign of [[George V]]. Dean grew up as a supporter of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] thanks to the efforts of his father, William Sr., who took him to a match during the 1914\u20131915 title-winning season.\n\nDean's childhood coincided with the [[World War I|First World War]], and between the ages of 7 and 11 he delivered cow's milk to local families as part of the \"war effort: \"Well, it was war time you see, so you were grafting all the time. I used to take milk out. I'd be up at half-past four in the morning and go down and get the ponies and the milk floats, then I'd come out to this place in Upton, between [[Upton, Merseyside|Upton]] and [[Arrowe Park]], and Burgess' Farm was there. We used to collect the milk in the big urns and take it out to people's houses, serving it out of the ladle. And not only that, you had an allotment, and that was in school time. And there was no such thing as pinching and stealing and all that bloody caper. In those days, you were growing all that stuff and you needed it for the war time.\"<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingintelligence.com/2010/03/09/dixie-dean-i-never-had-any-lessons-at-school-no-maths-no-english-nothing-except-football/|title=Interview with John Roberts|last=Roberts|first=John|publisher=SportingIntelligence.com|accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nDean attended Laird Street School,{{sfn|Keith|2003|p=10}} but felt he received no formal education: \"My only lesson was football&nbsp;... I used to give the pens out on Friday afternoons&nbsp;... the ink, and the chalks. That was the only job I had in school&nbsp;... I never had any lessons.\"<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> When he turned 11 he attended Albert (Memorial) Industrial School, a [[borstal]] school in Birkenhead, because of the football facilities on offer. The Dean family home had little room for him due to the family's size; Dean was happy with the arrangement, since he could play on the school's football team.{{sfn|Keith|2003|p=10}} Dean falsely told fellow pupils he had been caught stealing, since he wanted to be \"one of the boys\".{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nHe left school at 14 and worked for [[Wirral Railway]] as an apprentice fitter; his father also worked there, and had been working since he was 11 years old<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> for [[Great Western Railway]]. The elder Dean later became a train driver before moving to Birkenhead to work for Wirral Railway, to be closer to his future wife (and William Jr.'s mother) Sarah. Dean's father would later retire with the company.{{sfn|Keith|2003|p=10}}\n\nDean took a night job so that he could concentrate on his first love, football: \"The other two apprentice fitters, they didn't like the night job because there were too many bloody rats around there, coming out of the Anglo-Oil company and the Vacuum Oil Company &nbsp;... rats as big as whippets. So I took their night job, and of course, I could always have a game of football then.\"<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> Dean would kick the trespassing rats against the wall.\n\nThe sons of Dean's manager at Wirral Railway were directors of [[New Brighton A.F.C.]], and they were interested in signing Dean. However, Dean told the club he was not interested in signing and instead played for local team Pensby United in [[Pensby, Merseyside|Pensby]]. It was at Pensby United where Dean attracted the attention of a Tranmere Rovers scout.<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/>\n\n===\"Dixie\" nickname===\nSome said that Dean and his family disliked his nickname, and preferred people to call him \"Bill\" or \"Billy\". The popular theory regarding how Dean acquired his nickname is that he did so in his youth, perhaps due to his dark complexion and hair (which bore a resemblance to people from the [[Southern United States]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/everton-fc/everton-dixie-dean/2007/01/23/footballing-world-wakes-up-to-dixie-100252-18518223/2/|title=Footballing world wakes up to Dixie|last=Prentice|first=David|date=23 January 2007|work=Liverpool Echo|accessdate=10 June 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In Dean's obituary in ''[[The Times]]'', [[Geoffrey Green]] suggested that the nickname was taken from a \"Dixie\" song that was popular during Dean's childhood; there was \"something of the [[Uncle Tom]] about his features\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Mr Dixie Dean|last=Green|first=Geoffrey|work=The Times|page=16}}</ref>\n\nAlternatively, Tranmere Rovers club historian Gilbert Upton uncovered evidence, verified by Dean's late Godmother, that the name \"Dixie\" was a corruption of his childhood nickname, Digsy (acquired from his approach to the children's game of tag, where Dean would dig his fist into a girl's back\u2014 hence \"Digsy\").{{sfn|Upton|1992}}\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Tranmere Rovers===\nHe played football for Laird Street School, Moreton Bible Class, Heswell and Pensby United. He then joined the pro ranks with his local club, [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] in November 1923. He was 16 at the time.\n\nWhilst at Tranmere, he was on the receiving end of a tough challenge which resulted in him losing a [[testicle]] in a reserve game against [[Altrincham F.C.|Altrincham]].{{sfn|Keith|2003|p=8}}<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/may/18/seven-sins-football-wrath-part-two|title=The seven deadly sins of football: Wrath&nbsp;\u2013 From Big Jack Charlton to the fan's hand grenade at Millwall |date=18 May 2009|work=The Guardian|accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref> Immediately following the challenge, a teammate rubbed the area to ease the pain. Dean shouted \"Don't rub 'em, count 'em!\".{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nIn his 16 months at Tranmere spanning seasons 1923/24 and 1924/25 he scored 27 goals in 30 league appearances. All 27 were in the second of those two seasons in which he averaged exactly a goal per game. His exploits attracted the interest of many clubs across England, including [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> Upon leaving Tranmere Rovers, secretary [[Bert Cooke]] reneged on an agreement to pay 10 percent of the transfer fee to Dean. Dean was paid one percent of the fee, which he gave to his parents (who donated it to [[Birkenhead General Hospital]]).\n\n===Everton===\nHis father had taken him to a league game at [[Goodison Park]] when he was eight years old. It was a dream come true for Dean when Everton secretary [[Thomas H. McIntosh]] arranged to meet him at the Woodside Hotel in 1925. Dean was so excited that he ran the {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} distance from his home in north Birkenhead to the riverside to meet him.<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> He signed for Everton in March 1925 having just turned 18.\n\nHe later revealed that he expected a \u00a3300 signing fee to be given to his parents when he transferred to Everton. They received only \u00a330, and Tranmere Rovers manager Bert Cooke told him \"that's all the League will allow\". Dean appealed to John McKenna, chairman of [[the Football Association]], but was told \"I'm afraid you've signed, and that's it.\"<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> Dean signed for Everton for \u00a33,000, then a record fee received for Tranmere Rovers. He made an immediate impact, scoring 32 goals in his first full season. A motorcycling accident at [[Holywell, Flintshire|Holywell]], [[North Wales]] in summer 1926 left Dean with a fractured skull and jaw, and doctors were unsure whether he would be able to play again. In his next game for Everton he scored using his head, leading Evertonians to joke that the doctor left a metal plate in Dean's head.\n\nDean's greatest point of note is that he is still the only player in English football to score 60 league goals in one season ([[1927-28 in English football|1927\u201328]]).<ref name=\"English League Leading Goalscorers 1889-2007\">{{cite web\n| title = English League Leading Goalscorers 1889\u20132007\n| url = http://rsssf.com/tablese/engtops.html\n| publisher = RSSSF\n| accessdate =14 August 2007}}</ref> At that season's end he was 21 years old. Middlesbrough's [[George Camsell]], who holds the highest goals-to-games ratio for England, had scored 59 league goals the previous season, although this was in the Second Division.\n\nIn that 1927-28 season Everton won the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] title. When they were relegated to [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in 1930 Dean stayed with them. The club went on to immediately win the Second Division in [[1930-31 in English football|1931]], followed by the First Division again in [[1931-32 in English football|1932]]. They then immediately won the [[FA Cup]] in [[1933 FA Cup Final|1933]] (in which he scored in the [[1933 FA Cup Final|final]]) \u2013 a sequence unmatched since.\n\nIn December 1933, Dean issued a public appeal to have stolen goods returned to him. ''[[The Times]]'' issued a statement: \"Dixie Dean, the Everton and England forward appeals to the thief who robbed him of an international cap and presentation clock to return them. His house in Caldy Road, Walton, Liverpool was entered in his absence over Christmas, and the thief left behind gold watches and jewelry (sic).\"<ref>{{cite news|title=News in brief|date=30 December 1933|work=The Times|page=7}}</ref> By then, Dean was captain of the side. However, the harsh physical demands of the game (as it was played then) took their toll and he was dropped from the first team in 1937.\n\n===Notts County===\nDean went on to play for [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] for one season, in which he scored three goals in nine games.\n\n===Sligo Rovers===\nAt age 32, Dean signed for Irish team Sligo Rovers in January 1939 to help the club in their FAI Cup campaign. On his arrival, the Railway station in [[Sligo]] was said to be filled with locals trying to catch a glimpse of him. Dean scored ten goals in seven games for the club,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/amateur-football/2009/12/09/the-cameo-that-shaped-seamus-100252-25354309/|title=The cameo that shaped Seamus|last=Randles|first=Dave|date=9 December 2009|publisher=Liverpool Echo|accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref> including five in a 7\u20131 win over [[Waterford F.C.|Waterford]] (which remains a club record for the most goals scored in a single game). He also played in four Cup matches, scoring once (in the 1\u20131 final against [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]], who won the replay 1\u20130). Dean's runner-up medal was later stolen from his hotel room; on a return trip to Ireland to watch Rovers 39 years later in the 1978 [[FAI Cup]] final, a package was delivered to his hotel room with the medal inside.\n\n===Hurst===\nDean ended his professional playing days with [[Ashton United F.C.|Hurst]] (now [[Ashton United F.C.|Ashton United]]) in the [[Cheshire County League]] 1939\u201340 season, managing two games (and one goal) before the outbreak of war truncated his career. He made his debut in a 4\u20130 loss to [[Stalybridge Celtic F.C.|Stalybridge Celtic]]; 5,600 people attended the game, paying sixpence, earning the club gate receipts of \u00a3140.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ashtonutd.com/dixiedean.htm|title=Dixie Dean|publisher=Ashton United|accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n==International career==\nDean made his d\u00e9but for the [[England national football team]] against British rivals Wales at the [[Racecourse Ground]] in [[Wrexham]] in February 1927, less than a month after his 20th birthday. His final game for England came in a 1\u20130 victory over Ireland in October 1932 at [[Blackpool F.C.]]'s [[Bloomfield Road]], when Dean was 25 years old.\n\nDean was involved in the [[1927 British Home Championship|1927]] and [[1929 British Home Championship|1929]] editions of the [[British Home Championship]]. During the 1927 edition, Dean scored four goals in his two games for England and scored twice against Scotland at Hampden Park. Despite the loss, the Scots won the competition overall and applauded Dean (who finished the tournament as top scorer). In the 1929 edition, he scored in his only outing against Ireland at Goodison Park.\n\nThe only international competitions outside the British Home Championship during Dean's international career were the 1928 and 1936 Olympic Games and the inaugural [[FIFA World Cup]], which took place in [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]]; however, neither [[Great Britain national football team|Great Britain]] nor England participated. Dean represented England 16 times, scoring 18 goals in 8 games (including [[hat-trick]]s against Belgium and Luxembourg).\n\n[[Image:dixie-dean-wix-cigarettes.png|thumb|150px|right|alt=Dean. arms folded, in 1928 Wix Cigarettes newspaper advertisement|Dean in 1928 newspaper advertisement for Wix Cigarettes]]\n\n==Personal life and post-football career==\nDean became a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] in 1931 while playing for Everton and England. He was initiated in Randle Holme Lodge, No. 3261 on 18 February 1931 in Birkenhead,The Wirral.<ref>Article \"The Beautiful Game\" by Patrick Kidd and Matthew Scanlan, published in \"Freemasonry Today,\" No.11, Summer 2010</ref>\n\nAfter retiring, he went on to run the Dublin Packet [[public house|pub]] in [[Chester]] (Everton and the Dublin Packet commemorate this with memorabilia) and work at [[Littlewoods]] [[football pools]] as a porter at their Walton Hall Avenue offices (where he was remembered by fellow workers as a quiet, unassuming man).\n\n==Declining health and death==\n\nIn January 1972, Dean was admitted to St. Catherine's hospital in Birkenhead suffering from the effects of [[influenza]]<ref>{{cite news|title=News in brief|date=20 January 1972|work=The Times|page=2}}</ref> and was released a month later.<ref>{{cite news|title=News in brief|date=21 February 1972|work=The Times|page=4}}</ref> In November 1976, he had his right leg amputated due to a [[thrombosis|blood clot]]; Dean's health was declining, and he became increasingly homebound.\n\nDean died on 1 March 1980 at age 73 after suffering a [[heart attack]] at Everton's home ground [[Goodison Park]] whilst watching a match against their closest rivals, [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. It was the first time that Dean had visited Goodison Park in several years, due to ill health. \"He belongs to the company of the supremely great, like [[Ludwig Van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Rembrandt]]\", said [[Bill Shankly]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalfootballmuseum.com/pages/fame/Inductees/dixiedean.htm |title=Hall of fame inductee: Dixie Dean |year=2002 |publisher=nationalfootballmuseum.com |accessdate=9 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803235613/http://www.nationalfootballmuseum.com/pages/fame/Inductees/dixiedean.htm |archivedate=3 August 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref> His funeral took place at St. James' Church on Laird Street (the street where he was born) in Birkenhead.<ref>{{cite news|title=News in brief|date=8 March 1980|page=3|work=The Times}}</ref> Dean was survived by his four children: William, Geoffrey, Ralph and Barbara; he outlived his wife Ethel, who died of a heart attack in 1974 after 43 years of marriage.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.vintagebluekipper.com/dixie/legend.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=26 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820131444/http://www.vintagebluekipper.com/dixie/legend.htm |archive-date=20 August 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Image:Dixie Dean Monument.jpg|thumb|right|Dixie Dean statue outside Goodison Park|alt=Statue of Dean in football kit with ball]]\nDean was an internationally known figure.

These colonies were formally known as '''British America''' and the '''British West Indies''' before the [[Thirteen Colonies]] fought for their independence in the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u20131783) and formed the United States of America.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Summary View of the Rights of British America \u2013 Thomas Jefferson|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch14s10.html}}</ref> After the [[American Revolution]], the term [[British North America]] referred to the remainder of Great Britain's Canadian possessions. That term was first used informally in 1783, but it was uncommon before the ''Report on the Affairs of British North America'' (1839), generally known as the ''[[Durham Report]]''.\n\nBritish America gained large amounts of territory with the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]], which ended the [[French and Indian War]] in America and the [[Seven Years' War]] in Europe. At the start of the Revolutionary War in 1775, the British Empire included 23 colonies and territories on the North American continent. The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] ended the war, and Britain lost much of this territory to the newly formed United States. In addition, Britain ceded [[East Florida|East]] and [[West Florida]] to the Kingdom of Spain, which in turn ceded them to the United States in 1821.

bass at fourteen. As a young man in Europe, Vitou\u0161 was a competitive swimmer. One of his early music groups was the Junior Trio with his brother Alan on drums and [[Jan Hammer]] on keyboards. He studied music at the [[Prague Conservatory]] (under Franti\u0161ek Po\u0161ta),<ref>{{cite web|title=Miroslav Vitous: It Comes Down to Taste |publisher=All About Jazz |first=Paul |last=Olsen |url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=27881 |date=7 January 2008 |accessdate=2010-06-20}}</ref> and won a music contest in Vienna that gave him a scholarship to the [[Berklee College of Music]].<ref name=\"AAJ\" />\n\nIn 1967, in Chicago, [[Miles Davis]] saw Vitou\u0161 playing with [[Clark Terry]] and invited him to join his group for a residency at [[The Village Gate]] in New York City.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecmrecords.com/Background/2013.php |title=ECM |work=ecmrecords.com |accessdate=23 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224010021/http://www.ecmrecords.com/Background/2013.php |archive-date=24 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n \nHis 1970 Embryo/Atlantic album ''[[Infinite Search]]''<ref name=\"AAJ\" /> aka \u201cMountain In The Clouds\u201d was recorded with [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Jack DeJohnette]], and [[Joe Henderson]]. That year, he also recorded \u201c[[Purple]]\u201d for Columbia Records with McLaughlin, Billy Cobham and Joe Zawinul.\n\nHe has also worked with [[Chick Corea]], [[Larry Coryell]], [[Jan Garbarek]], [[Freddie Hubbard]], [[Michel Petrucciani]], [[Terje Rypdal]], [[Wayne Shorter]], and [[Joe Zawinul]]\n\nIn 1970 he was a founding member of the group [[Weather Report]].<ref name=\"AAJ\" /> In 1973 he was replaced by [[Alphonso Johnson]]. He stated, \"I enjoyed the beginning of it very much, but it turned into a little bit of a drag in the end because Joe Zawinul wanted to go in another direction. The band was seeking success and fame and they basically changed their music to go a commercial way into a black funk thing\". He also felt aggrieved financially. \"I was an equal partner and basically, I didn't get anything. We had a corporation together that was completely ignored. If you have a company and three people own it, and then two people say 'Okay, we don't want to work like this anymore. It's just two of us now', normally, they break down the stock and pay off the third person\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Prasad |first1=Anil |title=Miroslav Vitous \u2013 Freeing the Muse|url=http://www.innerviews.org/inner/vitous.html |website=Inner Views |accessdate=2015-01-07}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Roy Haynes Quintet 1981.jpg|left|thumb|Vitous with Roy Haynes Quintet 1981]]\nIn 1981 he performed at the [[Woodstock Jazz Festival]] held in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the [[Creative Music Studio]].
