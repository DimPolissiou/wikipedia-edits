Barcelona: Llotja de Mar.]]\n\nAccording to Roman tradition, '''Lucretia''' ({{IPAc-en|l|u\u02d0|\u02c8|k|r|i\u02d0|\u0283|\u0259}} {{respell|loo|KREE|sh\u0259}}, {{IPA-la|l\u028a\u02c8kre\u02d0t\u026a.a|classical}}; died {{circa|510&nbsp;BC}}), anglicized as '''Lucrece''', was a [[Women in ancient Rome|noblewoman in ancient Rome]] whose rape by [[Sextus Tarquinius]] (Tarquin), an Etruscan king's son, was the cause of a rebellion that [[Overthrow of the Roman monarchy|overthrew the Roman monarchy]] and led to the transition of Roman government from a [[Roman Kingdom|kingdom]] to a [[Roman Republic|republic]]. There are no contemporary sources; information regarding Lucretia, her rape and suicide, and the consequence of this being the start of the Roman Republic, come from the later accounts of Roman historian [[Livy]] and Greco-Roman historian [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]].\n\nThe incident kindled the flames of dissatisfaction over the tyrannical methods of the last king of Rome, [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]]. As a result, the prominent families instituted a republic, drove the extensive royal family of Tarquin from Rome, and successfully defended the republic against attempted [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] and [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] intervention. The rape itself became a major theme in European art and literature.\n\nOne of the first two [[consul]]s of the Roman Republic, [[Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus]] was Lucretia's husband. All the numerous sources on the establishment of the republic reiterate the basic events of Lucretia's story, though accounts vary slightly. Lucretia's story is not considered a [[myth]] by most historians, but rather a historical [[legend]] about an early history that was already a major part of Roman [[folklore]] before it was first written about. The evidence points to the historical existence of a woman named Lucretia and a historical incident that played a critical part in the real downfall of a real monarchy. Many of the specific details, though, are debatable, and vary depending on the writer. Post-Roman uses of the legend typically became mythical in portrayal, being of artistic rather than historical merit.\n\nAs the events of the story move rapidly, the date of the incident is probably the same year as the first of the ''[[fasti]]''. Dionysius of Halicarnassus, a major source, sets this year \"at the beginning of the sixty-eighth [[Olympiad]] ... [[Isagoras]] being the annual [[archon]] at [[Athens]]\";<ref>D.H. V.1.</ref> that is, 508/507&nbsp;BC (the ancient calendars split years over modern ones). According to this source Lucretia therefore died in 508&nbsp;BC. The other historical sources tend to support this date, but the year is debatable within a range of about five years.<ref>{{cite book |first=Timothy J |last=Cornell |title=The Beginnings of Rome: Italy and Rome from the Bronze Age to the Punic Wars (c. 1000\u2013264&nbsp;BC) |series=The Routledge History of the Ancient World |chapter=9.

The most common type of depiction.]]\n[[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]], last king of Rome, being engaged in the siege of [[Ardea (RM)|Ardea]], sent his son, [[Sextus Tarquinius|Tarquin]], on a military errand to [[Collatia]]. Tarquin was received with great hospitality at the governor's mansion, home of [[Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus]], son of the king's nephew, [[Arruns Tarquinius (Egerius)|Arruns Tarquinius]], former governor of Collatia and first of the [[Tarquinius|Tarquinii Collatini]]. Collatinus' wife, Lucretia, daughter of [[Spurius Lucretius]], prefect of Rome, \"a man of distinction,\"<ref name=DHIV64>D.H. IV.64.</ref> made sure that the king's son was treated as became his rank, although her husband was away at the siege.\n\nIn a variant of the story,<ref>T.L. I.57.</ref> Tarquin and Collatinus, at a wine party on furlough, were debating the virtues of wives when Collatinus volunteered to settle the debate by all of them riding to his home to see what Lucretia was doing. She was weaving with her maids. The party awarded her the palm of victory and Collatinus invited them to visit, but for the time being they returned to camp.\n\nAt night, Tarquin entered her bedroom by stealth, quietly going around the slaves who were sleeping at her door. She awakened. He identified himself and offered her two choices: she could submit to his sexual advances and become his wife and future queen, or he would kill her and one of her slaves and place the bodies together, then claim he had caught her having adulterous sex (see [[sexuality in ancient Rome]] for Roman attitudes toward sex). In the alternative story, he returned from camp a few days later with one companion to take Collatinus up on his invitation to visit and was lodged in a guest bedroom. He entered Lucretia's room while she lay naked in her bed and started to wash her belly with water, which woke her up.\n\n==Consequences==\nTarquin returned to camp. The next day Lucretia dressed in black and went to her father's house in Rome and cast herself down in the supplicant's position (embracing the knees), weeping. Asked to explain herself, she insisted on first summoning witnesses and after disclosing the rape, called on them for vengeance, a plea that could not be ignored, as she was speaking to the chief magistrate of Rome. While they were debating the proper course of action, she drew a concealed dagger and stabbed herself in the heart. She died in her father's arms, with the women present [[keening]] and lamenting. \"This dreadful scene struck the Romans who were present with so much horror and compassion that they all cried out with one voice that they would rather die a thousand deaths in defence of their liberty than suffer such outrages to be committed by the tyrants.\"<ref>D.H. IV.66.</ref>\n\nIn the alternative version, she did not go to Rome, but sent for her father and her husband asking them to bring one friend each. Those selected were [[Publius Valerius Publicola]] from Rome and [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] from the camp at Ardea. They found Lucretia in her room. She explained what had happened and after exacting an oath of vengeance\u2014\"Pledge me your solemn word that the adulterer shall not go unpunished.\"\u2014<ref name=TLI58>T.L. I.58.</ref> and while they were discussing the matter, drew the poignard and stabbed herself in her heart.\n\nIn another version Collatinus and Brutus were encountered returning to Rome unaware, were briefed, and were brought to the death scene. Brutus happened to be a politically motivated participant. By kinship he was a Tarquin on his mother's side, the son of Tarquinia, daughter of [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus]], the third king before last. He was a candidate for the throne if anything should happen to Superbus. By law, however, as he was a Junius on his father's side, he was not a Tarquin and therefore could later propose the exile of the Tarquins without fear for himself. Superbus had taken his inheritance and left him a pittance, keeping him at court for entertainment.<ref>D.H. IV.68.</ref>\n\n[[File:N03Brutus-u-Lucretia.jpg|thumb|left|The less common subject of [[Lucius Junius Brutus|Brutus]] holding the dead Lucretia and swearing the oath]]\nCollatinus, seeing his wife dead, became distraught. He held her, kissed her, called her name and spoke to her. Seeing the hand of Destiny in these events, his friend Brutus called the grieving party to order, explained that his simplicity had been a sham, and proposed that they drive the Tarquins from Rome. Grasping the bloody dagger,<ref>D.H. IV.70.</ref> he swore by Mars and all the other gods that he would do everything in his power to overthrow the dominion of the Tarquinii and that he would neither be reconciled to the tyrants himself nor tolerate any who should be reconciled to them, but would look upon every man who thought otherwise as an enemy and till his death would pursue with unrelenting hatred both the tyranny and its abettors; and if he should violate his oath, he prayed that he and his children might meet with the same end as Lucretia.\n\nHe passed the dagger around and each mourner swore the same oath by it. The two stories agree on this point: Livy's version is:<ref name=TLI59>T.L. I.59.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>By this blood\u2014most pure before the outrage wrought by the king's son\u2014I swear, and you, O gods, I call to witness that I will drive hence Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, together with his cursed wife and his whole blood, with fire and sword and every means in my power, and I will not suffer them or anyone else to reign in Rome.</blockquote>\n\n==Revolution==\n[[File:7031 Lucrecia romana.jpg|thumbnail|right|''Lucretia'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] ]]\n[[File:Gentileschi-Lucrezia-Potsdam.jpg|thumb|The rape, by [[Artemisia Gentileschi]]]]\n{{Main article|Overthrow of the Roman monarchy}}\nThe newly sworn revolutionary committee paraded the bloody corpse to the [[Roman Forum]] and arriving there heard grievances against the Tarquins and began to enlist an army. Brutus \"urged them to act as men and Romans and take up arms against their insolent foes.\"<ref name=TLI59/> The gates of Rome were blockaded by the new revolutionary soldiers and more were sent to guard Collatia. By now a crowd had gathered in the forum; the presence of the magistrates among the revolutionaries kept them in good order.\n\nBrutus happened to be Tribune of the Celeres, a minor office of some religious duties, but one which as a magistracy gave him the theoretical power to summon the [[curiae]], an organization of patrician families used mainly to ratify the decrees of the king. Summoning them on the spot he transformed the crowd into an authoritative legislative assembly and began to harangue them in one of the more noted and effective speeches of ancient Rome.\n\nHe began by revealing that his pose as fool was a sham designed to protect him against an evil king. He levelled a number of charges against the king and his family: the outrage against Lucretia, whom everyone could see on the dais, the king's tyranny, the forced labor of the [[plebeians]] in the ditches and sewers of Rome. He pointed out that Superbus had come to rule by the murder of [[Servius Tullius]], his wife's father, next-to-the-last king of Rome. He \"solemnly invoked the gods as the avengers of murdered parents.\" The king's wife, [[Tullia (daughter of Servius Tullius)|Tullia]], was in fact in Rome and probably was a witness to the proceedings from her palace near the forum. Seeing herself the target of so much animosity she fled from the palace in fear of her life and proceeded to the camp at Ardea.<ref name=TLI59/>\n\nBrutus opened a debate on the form of government Rome ought to have, a debate at which many [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] spoke. In summation he proposed the banishment of the Tarquins from all the territories of Rome and appointment of an [[interrex]] to nominate new magistrates and conduct an election of ratification. They had decided on a republican form of government with two consuls in place of a king executing the will of a patrician senate. This was a temporary measure until they could consider the details more carefully. Brutus renounced all right to the throne. In subsequent years the powers of the king were divided among various elected magistracies.\n\nA final vote of the curiae carried the interim constitution. Spurius Lucretius was swiftly elected interrex; he was prefect of the city already. He proposed Brutus and Collatinus as the first two consuls and that choice was ratified by the curiae. Needing to acquire the assent of the population as a whole, they paraded Lucretia through the streets summoning the plebeians to legal assembly in the forum. Once there they heard a constitutional speech by Brutus not unlike many speeches and documents of western civilization subsequently. It began:<ref>D.H. IV.78.</ref>\n\n{{quote|In as much as Tarquinius neither obtained the sovereignty in accordance with our ancestral customs and laws, nor, since he obtained it\u2014in whatever manner he got it\u2014has he been exercising it in an honourable or kingly manner, but has surpassed in insolence and lawlessness all the tyrants the world ever saw, we patricians met together and resolved to deprive him of his power, a thing we ought to have done long ago, but are doing now when a favourable opportunity has offered. And we have called you together, plebeians, in order to declare our own decision and then ask for your assistance in achieving liberty for our country ....}}\n\nA general election was held. The vote was for the republic. The monarchy was at an end, even while Lucretia was still displayed in the forum.\n\nThe constitutional consequences of this event were, formally at least, to reverberate for more than two thousand years. Rome would never again have a hereditary \"king,\" even if [[Roman Empire|later emperors]] were absolute rulers in all but name. This constitutional tradition prevented both [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Octavian Augustus]] from accepting a crown; instead they had to devise a confluence of several [[Roman Republic|republican offices]] onto their persons in order to secure absolute power. Their [[Roman emperor|successors]] both in [[Western Roman Empire|Rome]] and in [[Byzantine Emperor|Constantinople]] adhered to this tradition in form if not in essence, and even the office of German [[Holy Roman Emperor]] remained typically elective rather than hereditary\u2014up to its abolition in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], over 2300 years later.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Sandro Botticelli 078.jpg|thumb|Detail of ''[[The Story of Lucretia (Botticelli)|The Story of Lucretia]]'' ({{circa|1500\u201301}}), by [[Sandro Botticelli]].

The gates of Rome being barred and armed men on the wall, they returned to camp. Meanwhile, letters had arrived from the revolutionary committee and were read to the troops by Herminius and Horatius. The men were assembled by unit for a vote, by which the revolution was confirmed. In one story the Tarquins escaped to Gabii. A 15-year truce was made with Ardea. The troops returned to Rome.\n\nSuperbus was not long in Gabii. He had to retire with his men to [[Tarquinii]], where he raised the standard of intervention among the Etruscans. In an alternative story he went directly to Tarquinii with two of his sons; the third, Tarquin, attempted to resume control of Gabii, but was assassinated. The Romans had to face one intervention by the Etruscans ([[Horatius Cocles]]) and another by the [[Latin League]] ([[Battle of Lake Regillus]]). Sentiment ran high against the Tarquins. Collatinus was asked to resign over constitutional issues. He complied and was replaced by [[Publius Valerius Publicola]].\n\n==In literature and music==\n[[File:Lucretia MR.jpg|thumb|[[Marcantonio Raimondi]]'s 1534 engraving of her suicide]]\n\n[[Livy]]'s account in ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita Libri]]'' (c. 25\u20138 BC) is the earliest surviving full historical treatment. In his account her husband has boasted of the virtue of his wife to Tarquin and others. Livy contrasts the virtue of the Roman Lucretia, who remained in her room weaving, with the Etruscan ladies who feasted with friends. Ovid recounts the story of Lucretia in Book II of his ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', published in 8 AD, concentrating on the bold over-reaching character of Tarquin. Later, [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] made use of the figure of Lucretia in ''[[The City of God]]'' (published 426 AD) to defend the honour of Christian women who had been raped in the sack of Rome and had not committed suicide.\n\nThe story of Lucretia was a popular moral tale in the later Middle Ages.  Lucretia appears to [[Dante]] in the section of Limbo reserved to the nobles of Rome and other \"virtuous pagans\" in Canto IV of the [[Inferno (Dante)|''Inferno'']]. [[Christine de Pizan]] used Lucretia just as St. Augustine of Hippo did in her ''City of Ladies'', defending a woman's sanctity.\n\nIt is recounted in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]'', [[John Gower]]'s ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' (Book VII), and [[John Lydgate]]'s ''[[Fall of Princes]]''. Lucretia's rape and suicide is also the subject of William Shakespeare's 1594 long poem ''[[The Rape of Lucrece]]'', which draws extensively on Ovid's treatment of the story;<ref>Shakespeare's Poems: Venus and Adonis, ''The Rape of Lucrece and the Shorter Poems'', ed. by Katherine Duncan Jones (Arden Shakespeare, 3rd edn., 2007), 'Introduction', passim.</ref> he also mentioned her in ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'', in ''[[As You Like It]]'', and in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' in which Malvolio authenticates his fateful letter by spotting Olivia's Lucrece seal, and alludes to her in ''[[Macbeth]]'', and in ''[[Cymbeline]]'' he further refers to the story, though without mentioning Lucretia by name. Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli's comedy [[The Mandrake|''La Mandragola'']] is loosely based on the Lucretia story.\n\nShe is also mentioned in the poem \"[[Appius and Virginia]]\" by [[John Webster]] and [[Thomas Heywood]], which includes the following lines:\n\n{{quote|<poem>Two fair, but ladies most infortunate,\nHave in their ruins rais'd declining Rome,\nLucretia and [[Verginia|Virginia]], both renown'd\nFor chastity.<ref>John Webster ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=w_5ADgAAQBAJ&pg=PT171&lpg=PT171&dq=%22ladies+most+infortunate%22&source=bl&ots=b14T7Zh4hk&sig=TNFhQWg5Lte4Lr8O-yyNjfsBRy0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjmi87Zu4zaAhUHmrQKHYJzDvQQ6AEIMTAC Appius and Virginia]'' 5.3.224</ref></poem>}}\n\n[[Thomas Heywood]]'s play ''The Rape of Lucretia'' dates from 1607. The subject also enjoyed a revival in the mid twentieth century; [[Andr\u00e9 Obey]]'s 1931 play ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Le Viol de Lucr\u00e8ce|fr}}'' was adapted by librettist [[Ronald Duncan]] for ''[[The Rape of Lucretia]]'', a 1946 opera by [[Benjamin Britten]] which premiered at Glyndebourne. [[Ernst Krenek]] set [[Emmet Lavery]]'s [[libretto]] ''[[Tarquin (opera)|Tarquin]]'' (1940), a version in a contemporary setting.\n\n[[Jacques Gallot]] (died {{circa|1690}}) composed the allemandes \"[[Lucr\u00e8ce]]\" and \"[[Tarquin (Gallot)|Tarquin]]\" for baroque lute.\n\nIn [[Samuel Richardson]]'s 1740 novel ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded|Pamela]]'', Mr. B. cites the story of Lucretia as a reason why Pamela ought not fear for her reputation, should he rape her. Pamela quickly sets him straight with a better reading of the story. Colonial Mexican poet [[Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz]] also mentions Lucrecia in her poem \"Redondillas,\" a commentary on prostitution and who is to blame.\n\nIn 1769, doctor [[Joan Ramis]] wrote a tragedy in [[Menorca]] entitled ''Lucrecia''. The play is written in the [[Catalan language]] using a neoclassical style and is the most important work of the eighteenth century written in this language.\n\nIn 1932, the play ''Lucrece'' was produced on Broadway starring legendary actress [[Katharine Cornell]] in the title part. It was mostly performed in [[pantomime]].\n\nIn [[Donna Leon]]'s 2009 Venetian novel, ''About Face'', Franca Marinello refers to the tale of Tarquin and Lucrezia, as recounted in [[Ovid]]'s '' Fasti '' (Book II, for February 24, \"Regifugium\") to explain her actions to Commissario Brunetti.\n\n==Subject in art==\nSince the Renaissance, the suicide of Lucretia has been an enduring subject for visual artists, including [[Titian]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer|D\u00fcrer]], [[Raphael]], [[Botticelli]], [[J\u00f6rg Breu the Elder]], [[Johannes Moreelse]], [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], [[Dami\u00e0 Campeny]], [[Eduardo Rosales]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], and others. Most commonly, either the moment of the rape is shown or Lucretia is shown alone at the moment of her suicide. In either situation, her clothing is loosened or absent, while Tarquin is normally clothed.\n\nThe subject was one of a group showing women from legend or the Bible who were either powerless or only able to escape their situations by suicide, such as [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna]], [[Dido of Carthage]], and [[Verginia]].<ref>Russell, Nos 1\u201314</ref> These formed a counterpoint to, or sub-group of, the set of subjects known as the [[Power of Women]], showing female violence against, or domination of, men. These were often depicted by the same artists, and especially popular in [[Northern Renaissance]] art. The story of [[Esther]] lay somewhere between these two extremes.<ref>Russell, Nos 1, 15, 16</ref>\n\nThe subject of Lucretia spinning, with her ladies, is sometimes depicted, as in a series of four engravings of her story by [[Hendrick Goltzius]], which also includes a banquet.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=1853,0312.230 British Museum], ''Story of Lucretia''.</ref>\n\n;Examples with articles\n\n*[[Tarquin and Lucretia]]\u2014 life-size image of the rape by [[Titian]]\n*[[The Story of Lucretia (Botticelli)]]\u2014three scenes, of the rape, Brutus arousing the people, and the suicide\n*[[The Suicide of Lucretia (D\u00fcrer)]]\u2014single figure painting\n*[[Lucretia and her Husband]]\u2014distinctive depiction of Lucretia with a knife, and a shadowy male figure just behind.

There are no contemporary sources; information regarding Lucretia, her rape and suicide, and the consequence of this being the start of the Roman Republic, come from the later accounts of Roman historian [[Livy]] and Greco-Roman historian [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]].\n\nThe incident kindled the flames of dissatisfaction over the tyrannical methods of the last king of Rome, [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]]. As a result, the prominent families instituted a republic, drove the extensive royal family of Tarquin from Rome, and successfully defended the republic against attempted [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] and [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] intervention. As a result of its sheer impact, the rape itself became a major theme in European art and literature.\n\nOne of the first two [[consul]]s of the Roman Republic, [[Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus]] was Lucretia's husband. All the numerous sources on the establishment of the republic reiterate the basic events of Lucretia's story, though accounts vary slightly. Lucretia's story is not considered a [[myth]] by most historians, but rather a historical [[legend]] about an early history that was already a major part of Roman [[folklore]] before it was first written about. The evidence points to the historical existence of a woman named Lucretia and a historical incident that played a critical part in the real downfall of a real monarchy. Many of the specific details, though, are debatable, and vary depending on the writer. Post-Roman uses of the legend typically became mythical in portrayal, being of artistic rather than historical merit.\n\nAs the events of the story move rapidly, the date of the incident is probably the same year as the first of the ''[[fasti]]''. Dionysius of Halicarnassus, a major source, sets this year \"at the beginning of the sixty-eighth [[Olympiad]] ... [[Isagoras]] being the annual [[archon]] at [[Athens]]\";<ref>D.H. V.1.</ref> that is, 508/507&nbsp;BC (the ancient calendars split years over modern ones). Lucretia therefore died in 508&nbsp;BC. The other historical sources tend to support this date, but the year is debatable within a range of about five years.<ref>{{cite book |first=Timothy J |last=Cornell |title=The Beginnings of Rome: Italy and Rome from the Bronze Age to the Punic Wars (c. 1000\u2013264&nbsp;BC) |series=The Routledge History of the Ancient World |chapter=9.

The most common type of depiction.]]\n[[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]], last king of Rome, being engaged in the siege of [[Ardea (RM)|Ardea]], sent his son, [[Sextus Tarquinius|Tarquin]], on a military errand to [[Collatia]]. Tarquin was received with great hospitality at the governor's mansion, home of [[Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus]], son of the king's nephew, [[Arruns Tarquinius (Egerius)|Arruns Tarquinius]], former governor of Collatia and first of the [[Tarquinius|Tarquinii Collatini]]. Collatinus' wife, Lucretia, daughter of [[Spurius Lucretius]], prefect of Rome, \"a man of distinction,\"<ref name=DHIV64>D.H. IV.64.</ref> made sure that the king's son was treated as became his rank, although her husband was away at the siege.\n\nIn a variant of the story,<ref>T.L. I.57.</ref> Tarquin and Collatinus, at a wine party on furlough, were debating the virtues of wives when Collatinus volunteered to settle the debate by all of them riding to his home to see what Lucretia was doing. She was weaving with her maids. The party awarded her the palm of victory and Collatinus invited them to visit, but for the time being they returned to camp.\n\nAt night, Tarquin entered her bedroom by stealth, quietly going around the slaves who were sleeping at her door. She awakened. He identified himself and offered her two choices: she could submit to his sexual advances and become his wife and future queen, or he would kill her and one of her slaves and place the bodies together, then claim he had caught her having adulterous sex (see [[sexuality in ancient Rome]] for Roman attitudes toward sex). In the alternative story, he returned from camp a few days later with one companion to take Collatinus up on his invitation to visit and was lodged in a guest bedroom. He entered Lucretia's room while she lay naked in her bed and started to wash her belly with water, which woke her up.\n\n==Consequences==\nTarquin returned to camp. The next day Lucretia dressed in black and went to her father's house in Rome and cast herself down in the supplicant's position (embracing the knees), weeping. Asked to explain herself, she insisted on first summoning witnesses and after disclosing the rape, called on them for vengeance, a plea that could not be ignored, as she was speaking to the chief magistrate of Rome. While they were debating the proper course of action, she drew a concealed dagger and stabbed herself in the heart. She died in her father's arms, with the women present [[keening]] and lamenting. \"This dreadful scene struck the Romans who were present with so much horror and compassion that they all cried out with one voice that they would rather die a thousand deaths in defence of their liberty than suffer such outrages to be committed by the tyrants.\"<ref>D.H. IV.66.</ref>\n\nIn the alternative version, she did not go to Rome, but sent for her father and her husband asking them to bring one friend each. Those selected were [[Publius Valerius Publicola]] from Rome and [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] from the camp at Ardea. They found Lucretia in her room. She explained what had happened and after exacting an oath of vengeance\u2014\"Pledge me your solemn word that the adulterer shall not go unpunished.\"\u2014<ref name=TLI58>T.L. I.58.</ref> and while they were discussing the matter, drew the poignard and stabbed herself in her heart.\n\nIn another version Collatinus and Brutus were encountered returning to Rome unaware, were briefed, and were brought to the death scene. Brutus happened to be a politically motivated participant. By kinship he was a Tarquin on his mother's side, the son of Tarquinia, daughter of [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus]], the third king before last. He was a candidate for the throne if anything should happen to Superbus. By law, however, as he was a Junius on his father's side, he was not a Tarquin and therefore could later propose the exile of the Tarquins without fear for himself. Superbus had taken his inheritance and left him a pittance, keeping him at court for entertainment.<ref>D.H. IV.68.</ref>\n\n[[File:N03Brutus-u-Lucretia.jpg|thumb|left|The less common subject of [[Lucius Junius Brutus|Brutus]] holding the dead Lucretia and swearing the oath]]\nCollatinus, seeing his wife dead, became distraught. He held her, kissed her, called her name and spoke to her. Seeing the hand of Destiny in these events, his friend Brutus called the grieving party to order, explained that his simplicity had been a sham, and proposed that they drive the Tarquins from Rome. Grasping the bloody dagger,<ref>D.H. IV.70.</ref> he swore by Mars and all the other gods that he would do everything in his power to overthrow the dominion of the Tarquinii and that he would neither be reconciled to the tyrants himself nor tolerate any who should be reconciled to them, but would look upon every man who thought otherwise as an enemy and till his death would pursue with unrelenting hatred both the tyranny and its abettors; and if he should violate his oath, he prayed that he and his children might meet with the same end as Lucretia.\n\nHe passed the dagger around and each mourner swore the same oath by it. The two stories agree on this point: Livy's version is:<ref name=TLI59>T.L. I.59.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>By this blood\u2014most pure before the outrage wrought by the king's son\u2014I swear, and you, O gods, I call to witness that I will drive hence Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, together with his cursed wife and his whole blood, with fire and sword and every means in my power, and I will not suffer them or anyone else to reign in Rome.</blockquote>\n\n==Revolution==\n[[File:7031 Lucrecia romana.jpg|thumbnail|right|''Lucretia'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] ]]\n[[File:Gentileschi-Lucrezia-Potsdam.jpg|thumb|The rape, by [[Artemisia Gentileschi]]]]\n{{Main article|Overthrow of the Roman monarchy}}\nThe newly sworn revolutionary committee paraded the bloody corpse to the [[Roman Forum]] and arriving there heard grievances against the Tarquins and began to enlist an army. Brutus \"urged them to act as men and Romans and take up arms against their insolent foes.\"<ref name=TLI59/> The gates of Rome were blockaded by the new revolutionary soldiers and more were sent to guard Collatia. By now a crowd had gathered in the forum; the presence of the magistrates among the revolutionaries kept them in good order.\n\nBrutus happened to be Tribune of the Celeres, a minor office of some religious duties, but one which as a magistracy gave him the theoretical power to summon the [[curiae]], an organization of patrician families used mainly to ratify the decrees of the king. Summoning them on the spot he transformed the crowd into an authoritative legislative assembly and began to harangue them in one of the more noted and effective speeches of ancient Rome.\n\nHe began by revealing that his pose as fool was a sham designed to protect him against an evil king. He levelled a number of charges against the king and his family: the outrage against Lucretia, whom everyone could see on the dais, the king's tyranny, the forced labor of the [[plebeians]] in the ditches and sewers of Rome. He pointed out that Superbus had come to rule by the murder of [[Servius Tullius]], his wife's father, next-to-the-last king of Rome. He \"solemnly invoked the gods as the avengers of murdered parents.\" The king's wife, [[Tullia (daughter of Servius Tullius)|Tullia]], was in fact in Rome and probably was a witness to the proceedings from her palace near the forum. Seeing herself the target of so much animosity she fled from the palace in fear of her life and proceeded to the camp at Ardea.<ref name=TLI59/>\n\nBrutus opened a debate on the form of government Rome ought to have, a debate at which many [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] spoke. In summation he proposed the banishment of the Tarquins from all the territories of Rome and appointment of an [[interrex]] to nominate new magistrates and conduct an election of ratification. They had decided on a republican form of government with two consuls in place of a king executing the will of a patrician senate. This was a temporary measure until they could consider the details more carefully. Brutus renounced all right to the throne. In subsequent years the powers of the king were divided among various elected magistracies.\n\nA final vote of the curiae carried the interim constitution. Spurius Lucretius was swiftly elected interrex; he was prefect of the city already. He proposed Brutus and Collatinus as the first two consuls and that choice was ratified by the curiae. Needing to acquire the assent of the population as a whole, they paraded Lucretia through the streets summoning the plebeians to legal assembly in the forum. Once there they heard a constitutional speech by Brutus not unlike many speeches and documents of western civilization subsequently. It began:<ref>D.H. IV.78.</ref>\n\n{{quote|In as much as Tarquinius neither obtained the sovereignty in accordance with our ancestral customs and laws, nor, since he obtained it\u2014in whatever manner he got it\u2014has he been exercising it in an honourable or kingly manner, but has surpassed in insolence and lawlessness all the tyrants the world ever saw, we patricians met together and resolved to deprive him of his power, a thing we ought to have done long ago, but are doing now when a favourable opportunity has offered. And we have called you together, plebeians, in order to declare our own decision and then ask for your assistance in achieving liberty for our country ....}}\n\nA general election was held. The vote was for the republic. The monarchy was at an end, even while Lucretia was still displayed in the forum.\n\nThe constitutional consequences of this event were, formally at least, to reverberate for more than two thousand years. Rome would never again have a hereditary \"king,\" even if [[Roman Empire|later emperors]] were absolute rulers in all but name. This constitutional tradition prevented both [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Octavian Augustus]] from accepting a crown; instead they had to devise a confluence of several [[Roman Republic|republican offices]] onto their persons in order to secure absolute power. Their [[Roman emperor|successors]] both in [[Western Roman Empire|Rome]] and in [[Byzantine Emperor|Constantinople]] adhered to this tradition in form if not in essence, and even the office of German [[Holy Roman Emperor]] remained typically elective rather than hereditary\u2014up to its abolition in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], over 2300 years later.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Sandro Botticelli 078.jpg|thumb|Detail of ''[[The Story of Lucretia (Botticelli)|The Story of Lucretia]]'' ({{circa|1500\u201301}}), by [[Sandro Botticelli]].

Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli's comedy [[The Mandrake|''La Mandragola'']] is loosely based on the Lucretia story.\n\nShe is also mentioned in the poem \"[[Appius and Virginia]]\" by [[John Webster]] and [[Thomas Heywood]], which includes the following lines:\n\n{{quote|<poem>Two fair, but ladies most infortunate,\nHave in their ruins rais'd declining Rome,\nLucretia and [[Verginia|Virginia]], both renown'd\nFor chastity.<ref>John Webster ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=w_5ADgAAQBAJ&pg=PT171&lpg=PT171&dq=%22ladies+most+infortunate%22&source=bl&ots=b14T7Zh4hk&sig=TNFhQWg5Lte4Lr8O-yyNjfsBRy0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjmi87Zu4zaAhUHmrQKHYJzDvQQ6AEIMTAC Appius and Virginia]'' 5.3.224</ref></poem>}}\n\n[[Thomas Heywood]]'s play ''The Rape of Lucretia'' dates from 1607. The subject also enjoyed a revival in the mid twentieth century; [[Andr\u00e9 Obey]]'s 1931 play ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Le Viol de Lucr\u00e8ce|fr}}'' was adapted by librettist [[Ronald Duncan]] for ''[[The Rape of Lucretia]]'', a 1946 opera by [[Benjamin Britten]] which premiered at Glyndebourne. [[Ernst Krenek]] set [[Emmet Lavery]]'s [[libretto]] ''[[Tarquin (opera)|Tarquin]]'' (1940), a version in a contemporary setting.\n\n[[Jacques Gallot]] (died {{circa|1690}}) composed the allemandes \"[[Lucr\u00e8ce]]\" and \"[[Tarquin (Gallot)|Tarquin]]\" for baroque lute.\n\nIn [[Samuel Richardson]]'s 1740 novel ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded|Pamela]]'', Mr. B. cites the story of Lucretia as a reason why Pamela ought not fear for her reputation, should he rape her. Pamela quickly sets him straight with a better reading of the story. Colonial Mexican poet [[Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz]] also mentions Lucrecia in her poem \"Redondillas,\" a commentary on prostitution and who is to blame.\n\nIn 1769, doctor [[Joan Ramis]] wrote a tragedy in [[Menorca]] entitled ''Lucrecia''. The play is written in the [[Catalan language]] using a neoclassical style and is the most important work of the eighteenth century written in this language.\n\nIn 1932, the play ''Lucrece'' was produced on Broadway starring legendary actress [[Katharine Cornell]] in the title part. It was mostly performed in [[pantomime]].\n\nIn [[Donna Leon]]'s 2009 Venetian novel, ''About Face'', Franca Marinello refers to the tale of Tarquin and Lucrezia, as recounted in [[Ovid]]'s '' Fasti '' (Book II, for February 24, \"Regifugium\") to explain her actions to Commissario Brunetti.\n\n==Subject in art==\nSince the Renaissance, the suicide of Lucretia has been an enduring subject for visual artists, including [[Titian]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer|D\u00fcrer]], [[Raphael]], [[Botticelli]], [[J\u00f6rg Breu the Elder]], [[Johannes Moreelse]], [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], [[Dami\u00e0 Campeny]], [[Eduardo Rosales]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], and others. Most commonly, either the moment of the rape is shown or Lucretia is shown alone at the moment of her suicide. In either situation, her clothing is loosened or absent, while Tarquin is normally clothed.\n\nThe subject was one of a group showing women from legend or the Bible who were either powerless or only able to escape their situations by suicide, such as [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna]], [[Dido of Carthage]], and [[Verginia]].<ref>Russell, Nos 1\u201314</ref> These formed a counterpoint to, or sub-group of, the set of subjects known as the [[Power of Women]], showing female violence against, or domination of, men. These were often depicted by the same artists, and especially popular in [[Northern Renaissance]] art. The story of [[Esther]] lay somewhere between these two extremes.<ref>Russell, Nos 1, 15, 16</ref>\n\nThe subject of Lucretia spinning, with her ladies, is sometimes depicted, as in a series of four engravings of her story by [[Hendrick Goltzius]], which also includes a banquet.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=1853,0312.230 British Museum], ''Story of Lucretia''.</ref>\n\n;Examples with articles\n\n*[[Tarquin and Lucretia]]\u2014 life-size image of the rape by [[Titian]]\n*[[The Story of Lucretia (Botticelli)]]\u2014three scenes, of the rape, Brutus arousing the people, and the suicide\n*[[The Suicide of Lucretia (D\u00fcrer)]]\u2014single figure painting\n*[[Lucretia and her Husband]]\u2014distinctive depiction of Lucretia with a knife, and a shadowy male figure just behind.

His brother Jack Hilsdon also played for West Ham at this time. Hilsdon transferred to [[Chelsea FC|Chelsea]] in 1906, and was the first player to score 100 goals for the West London club, reaching a then-record 108 goals from 164 games by the time of his return to West Ham in 1912. His career was ended by the [[First World War]], to which he was conscripted in 1914 and crucially injured by a gas attack.\n\nHilsdon was nicknamed \"'''Gatling Gun'''\" because his shots \"were simply unstoppable and which travel like shots from a [[Gatling gun|gun]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n===Club===\nIn 1906, Hilsdon was recommended to then-[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] manager [[John Robertson (footballer born 1877)|John Robertson]], who had been advised that Hilsdon would be available for transfer; so enthralled was Robertson with Hilsdon's ability that he promised to turn him into Chelsea's next centre forward. Hilsdon joined Chelsea later that year on [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]4 a week wages. He scored five goals on his debut in a 9\u20132 win over [[Glossop North End F.C.|Glossop North End]], and would later score six in an [[FA Cup]] tie with [[Worksop Town F.C.|Worksop Town]], a club record which remains unequalled. The club programme described him as \"living proof that to become a first-class footballer it is not necessary to be born north of the [[River Tweed|Tweed]]\".\n\nHilsdon scored 27 goals that season, which helped earn Chelsea promotion to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in their second year of professional football. Within three years he had scored 76 goals in 99 appearances. His later days with Chelsea were hindered by problems with injuries and his personal life, including a battle with alcoholism, though he did score 19 goals in [[1910-11 in English football|1910\u201311]]. He became the first Chelsea player to score 100 goals, and ended his time there with 108 from 164 games. He is currently the club's [[Chelsea F.C. statistics#All-time Goalscorers|9th highest goal scorer of all time]].\n\nIn 1912, Hilsdon returned to West Ham, and was top scorer for them in the [[1912-13 in English football|1912\u201313]] season, scoring 17 goals in 36 games. He was known at this point as the \"old international\", even though he was still only 27 years of age. Hilsdon played for West Ham until 1915, and during his two spells there he recorded 92 [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] appearances, and scored 35 goals. Hilsdon also played in four [[World War I]] games for the East London club. He is also credited with helping the development of young West Ham striker [[Syd Puddefoot]].\n\n===International===\nHilsdon received international recognition for [[England national football team|England]], often playing alongside his Chelsea teammate, [[Jimmy Windridge]]. Shortly after joining Chelsea he was selected to play for a [[Football League XI]], for whom he hit a [[hat-trick]] in a 6\u20130 win over the [[Irish Football League|Irish League]] on his debut. He made his England debut in February 1907, against Ireland. He scored four goals for England in a 7\u20130 win over [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] and two apiece in wins over [[Ireland national football team (IFA)|Ireland]], [[Austria national football team|Austria]], [[Wales national football team|Wales]] and [[Czech Republic national football team|Bohemia]]. In all, he scored 14 times in just eight international games for England, eight of his goals coming from games in [[1907-08 in English football#National team|England's first overseas tour]] in 1908.\n\n==Military service and later life==\nDuring the [[First World War]] Hilsdon tried to avoid active service and was caught by the police hiding in a chicken run, and was called up. He fought on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] where he was attacked by gas. This affected him greatly, and in the words of his son, he \"copped the [[mustard gas]] at Arras\".\n\nThe gas attack caused sufficient damage to Hilsdon to end his footballing career. After the War, he worked as a teaboy on building sites, ran a [[Public house|pub]] and organised raffles in [[East End of London|East End]] pubs.\n\nHe died in [[Leicester]] in 1941 and only four people came to his funeral. In October 2015 Chelsea supporters raised funds for a headstone to mark his grave. A [[weather vane]] modelled on Hilsdon is still a feature of [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]], Chelsea's home ground. It was said to cause great misfortune if removed, and when it had to be removed during renovation in the late 1970s, Chelsea suffered financial and footballing difficulties.<ref>Rough Guide 11s: Chelsea</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{cite book | author=Kerrigan, Colm| title=Gattling Gun George Hilsdon | publisher=Football Lives | year=| isbn=0-9530718-0-4}}\n*{{cite book |author1=Blows, Kirk  |author2=Hogg, Tony| title=The Essential History of West Ham United | publisher=Headline | year=2000| isbn=0-7472-7036-8}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120204083326/http://www.lalamy.demon.co.uk/whulist.htm West Ham United F.C.

It is home to many [[High tech|high-tech]] industries, higher education institutions, and historical landmarks. The city has an extensive system of public transport and infrastructure, including the [[Kiev Metro]].\n\nThe city's name is said to derive from the name of [[Kyi, Shchek and Khoryv|Kyi]], one of its four legendary founders. During [[History of Kiev|its history]], Kiev, one of the oldest cities in Eastern Europe, passed through several stages of prominence and obscurity. The city probably existed as a commercial center as early as the 5th century. A [[Slavs|Slavic]] settlement on the great trade route between [[Scandinavia]] and [[Constantinople]], Kiev was a tributary of the [[Khazars]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/kiev|title=Kiev|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|accessdate=4 July 2015}}</ref> until its capture by the [[Varangians]] ([[Vikings]]) in the mid-9th century. Under Varangian rule, the city became a capital of the [[Kievan Rus']], the first [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] state. Completely destroyed during the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol invasions]] in 1240, the city lost most of its influence for the centuries to come. It was a provincial capital of marginal importance in the outskirts of the territories controlled by its powerful neighbours, first [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], then [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poland]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Kyiv|title=Kyiv - History|last=|first=|date=|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref>\n\nThe city prospered again during the [[Russian Empire]]'s [[Industrial Revolution]] in the late 19th century. In 1918, after the [[Ukrainian National Republic]] declared independence from [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]], Kiev became its capital. From 1921 onwards Kiev was a city of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], which was proclaimed by the [[Red Army]], and, from 1934, Kiev was its capital. The city was almost completely ruined during [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]] but quickly recovered in the postwar years, remaining the [[Soviet Union]]'s third-largest city.\n\nFollowing [[Collapse of the Soviet Union (1985\u20131991)|the collapse of the Soviet Union]] and [[History of Ukraine|Ukrainian independence]] in 1991, Kiev remained Ukraine's capital and experienced a steady influx of ethnic Ukrainian migrants from other regions of the country.<ref name=\"History of Ukraine\">{{cite book|last=Magocsi|first=Paul Robert|title=A History of Ukraine: The Land and Its Peoples|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0mKRsElYNkC&pg=PT481|edition=2nd, Revised|year=2010|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-1-4426-9879-6|page=481}}</ref> During the country's transformation to a [[market economy]] and [[electoral democracy]], Kiev has continued to be Ukraine's largest and wealthiest city.

Scattered [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] settlements existed in the area from the 6th century, but it is unclear whether any of them later developed into the city. The ''Primary Chronicle'' (a main source of information about the early history of the area) mentions Slavic Kievans telling [[Askold and Dir]] that they lived without a local ruler and paid a tribute to the Khazars in an entry attributed to the 9th century. At least during the 8th and 9th centuries Kiev functioned as an outpost of the Khazar empire. A hill-fortress, called Sambat (Old Turkic for \"High Place\") was built to defend the area. At some point during the late 9th or early 10th century Kiev fell under the rule of [[Varangians]] (see [[Askold and Dir]], and [[Oleg of Novgorod]]) and became the nucleus of the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] polity. The ''Primary Chronicle'' dates Oleg's conquest of the town in 882, but some historians, such as [[Omeljan Pritsak]] and [[Constantine Zuckerman]], dispute this and maintain that Khazar rule continued as late as the 920s (documentary evidence exists to support this assertion \u2013 see the [[Kievian Letter]] and [[Schechter Letter]]). Other historians suggest that Magyar tribes ruled the city between 840 and 878, before migrating with some [[Khazars|Khazar]] tribes to [[Hungary]]. According to these scholars the building of the fortress of Kiev was finished in 840 under the leadership of Ke\u0151 (Keve), Cs\u00e1k and Ger\u00e9b, the three brothers, possibly members of the [[Tarj\u00e1n tribe]]. The three names appear in the Kiev Chronicle as [[Kyi, Shchek and Khoryv]] \u2013 none of these names are Slavic, and Russian historians have always struggled to account for their meanings and origins. Their names were put into the Kiev Chronicle in the 12th century and they were identified as old-Russian mythological heroes.<ref>dr.

(Shevchenko worked as a field researcher and editor for the geography department). The medical faculty of the Saint Vladimir University, separated into an independent institution in 1919\u20131921 during the Soviet period, became the [[Bogomolets National Medical University]] in 1995.\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries the [[Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|Russian military]] and ecclesiastical authorities dominated city life;{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] had involvement in a significant part of Kiev's infrastructure and commercial activity. In the late 1840s the historian, [[Nikolay Kostomarov|Mykola Kostomarov]] ''({{lang-ru|link=no|Nikolay Kostomarov}})'', founded a secret political society, the Brotherhood of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Saint Cyril]] and [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Methodius]], whose members put forward the idea of a federation of free Slavic peoples with Ukrainians as a distinct and separate group rather than a subordinate part of the Russian nation; the Russian authorities quickly suppressed the society.\n\nFollowing the gradual loss of Ukraine's autonomy, Kiev experienced growing Russification in the 19th century by means of Russian migration, administrative actions and social modernization. At the beginning of the 20th century the [[Russian language|Russian]]-speaking part of the population dominated the city centre, while the [[Social class|lower classes]] living on the outskirts retained Ukrainian [[folk culture]] to a significant extent.{{Citation needed|date= April 2011}} However, enthusiasts among ethnic Ukrainian nobles, military and merchants made recurrent attempts to preserve native culture in Kiev (by clandestine book-printing, amateur theatre, folk studies etc.)\n\n[[File:Kiev downtown.jpg|thumb|right|Kiev in the late 19th century]]\nDuring the [[Russian industrial revolution]] in the late 19th century, Kiev became an important trade and transportation centre of the [[Russian Empire]], specialising in sugar and grain export by railway and on the Dnieper river. By 1900 the city had also become a significant industrial centre, having a population of 250,000. Landmarks of that period include the railway infrastructure, the foundation of numerous educational and cultural facilities as well as notable architectural monuments (mostly merchant-oriented). In 1892 the [[Kiev tram|first electric tram line]] of the Russian Empire started running in Kiev (the 3rd in the world).\n\nKiev prospered during the late 19th century [[Industrial Revolution]] in the [[Russian Empire]], when it became the third most important city of the Empire and the major centre of commerce of its southwest. In the [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution|turbulent period]] following the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|1917 Russian Revolution]], Kiev became the capital of several [[Ukrainian People's Republic|successive Ukrainian states]] and was caught in the middle of several conflicts: [[World War I]], during which German soldiers occupied it from 2 March 1918 to November 1918, the [[Russian Civil War]] of 1917 to 1922, and the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] of 1919\u20131921.

In 2004\u20132005, the city played host to the largest post-Soviet public demonstrations up to that time, in support of the [[Orange Revolution]].

However, the city's unique landscape distinguishes it from the surrounding region. Kiev is completely surrounded by [[Kiev Oblast]].\n\nOriginally on the west bank, today Kiev is located on both sides of the [[Dnieper]], which flows southwards through the city towards the [[Black Sea]]. The older and higher western part of the city sits on numerous wooded hills ([[Kiev Mountains|Kiev Hills]]), with ravines and small rivers. Kiev's geographical relief contributed to its [[toponym]]s, such as Podil (means lower), Pechersk (caves), and uzviz (a steep street, \"descent\"). Kiev is a part of the larger [[Dnieper Upland]] adjoining the western bank of the Dnieper in its mid-flow, and which contributes to the city's elevation change. The northern outskirts of the city border the [[Polesian Lowland]]. Kiev expanded into the [[Dnieper Lowland]] on the left bank (''to the east'') as late as the 20th century. The whole portion of Kiev on the left bank of the Dnieper is generally referred to as ''Left bank'' ({{lang-uk|\u041b\u0456\u0432\u0438\u0439 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0433}}, Livyi bereh). Significant areas of the left bank Dnieper valley were artificially sand-deposited, and are protected by dams.\n\nWithin the city the Dnieper River forms a branching system of [[tributary|tributaries]], isles, and harbors within the city limits. The city is close to the mouth of the [[Desna River]] and the [[Kiev Reservoir]] in the north, and the [[Kaniv Reservoir]] in the south. Both the Dnieper and Desna rivers are [[navigation|navigable]] at Kiev, although regulated by the reservoir shipping locks and limited by winter freeze-over.\n\nIn total, there are 448 bodies of open water within the boundaries of Kiev, which include the Dnieper itself, its reservoirs, and several small rivers, dozens of lakes and artificially created ponds. They occupy 7949 hectares. Additionally, the city has 16 developed beaches (totalling 140 hectares) and 35 near-water recreational areas (covering more than 1,000 hectares). Many are used for pleasure and recreation, although some of the bodies of water are not suitable for swimming.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Design by Maxim Tkachuk |author2=web-architecture by Volkova Dasha |author3=templated by Alexey Kovtanets |author4=programming by Irina Batvina |author5=Maxim Bielushkin |author6=Sergey Bogatyrchuk |author7=Vitaliy Galkin |author8=Victor Lushkin |author9=Dmitry Medun |author10=Igor Sitnikov |author11=Vladimir Tarasov |author12=Alexander Filippov |author13=Sergei Koshelev |url=http://korrespondent.net/kyiv/155583 |title=\u0413\u0434\u0435 \u0432 \u041a\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0435 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \" \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0432 \u041a\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0435 \u2013 \u041a\u043e\u0440\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442 |publisher=Korrespondent.net |accessdate=23 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[UN]] 2011 evaluation, there were no risks of [[natural disaster]]s in Kiev and [[Kiev metropolitan area|its metropolitan area]]<ref name=\"UN Urban agglomerations types of natural risks\">{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/unpd/wup/CD-ROM/WUP2011-F23-City_Risk_Natural-Disasters.xls |title=Urban agglomerations with 750,000 inhabitants or more in 2011 and types of natural risks |publisher=United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division |date=April 2012 |accessdate=1 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006152606/http://esa.un.org/unpd/wup/CD-ROM/WUP2011-F23-City_Risk_Natural-Disasters.xls |archivedate=6 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\n\nKiev has a warm-summer [[continental climate|humid continental]] [[climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfb'').<ref>{{cite journal| last = Kottek | first = M.|author2=J.

Historically located on the western right bank of the river, the city expanded into the left bank only in the 20th century. Most of Kiev's attractions as well as the majority of business and governmental institutions are located on the right bank. The eastern 'Left Bank' is predominantly residential. There are large industrial and green areas in both the Right Bank and the Left Bank.\n\nKiev is further informally divided into historical or territorial neighbourhoods, each housing from about 5,000 to 100,000 inhabitants.\n\n{{Panorama\n|image=File:\u041f\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0433\u0430.jpg\n|fullwidth=14570\n|fullheight=2000\n|caption=<center>A [[Panorama|panoramic]] view of Right-Bank Kiev, where the city centre is located (May 2011)</center>\n|alt=\n|height=210\n}}\n\n====Formal subdivision====\n\n{|class=\"infobox bordered\" style=\"font-size:88%;\"\n|+ {{resize|110%|The ten [[Subdivisions of Kiev|raions (districts) of Kiev]]}}\n|style=\"padding-right:1em;\" |\n:''\u0413''&nbsp;\u2014 [[Holosiiv Raion]]\n:''\u041e''&nbsp;\u2014 [[Obolon Raion]]\n:''\u041f\u0435\u0447''&nbsp;\u2014 [[Pechersk Raion]]\n:''\u041f\u043e\u0434''&nbsp;\u2014 [[Podil Raion]]\n:''\u0428''&nbsp;\u2014 [[Shevchenko Raion, Kiev|Shevchenko Raion]]\n:''\u0421\u0432''&nbsp;\u2014 [[Sviatoshyn Raion]]\n:''\u0421\u043e\u043b''&nbsp;\u2014 [[Solomianka Raion]]\n'''Left-bank districts'''\n:''\u0414\u0430\u0440''&nbsp;\u2014 [[Darnytsia Raion]]\n:''\u0414\u0435\u0441''&nbsp;\u2014 [[Desna Raion, Kiev|Desna Raion]]\n:''\u0414\u043d''&nbsp;\u2014 [[Dnipro Raion, Kiev|Dnipro Raion]]\n|[[File:\u0410\u0434\u043c\u0456\u043d\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0456\u043b \u041a\u0438\u0454\u0432\u0430.gif|280px]]\n|}\n\nThe first known formal subdivision of Kiev dates to 1810 when the city was subdivided into 4 parts: [[Pechersk, Kiev|Pechersk]], Starokyiv, and the first and the second parts of [[Podil]]. In 1833\u20131834 according to [[Russian tsar|Tsar]] [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]'s decree, Kiev was subdivided into 6 police [[raion]]s (districts); later being increased to 10. In 1917, there were 8 Raion Councils (''Duma''), which were reorganised by [[bolshevik]]s into 6 Party-Territory Raions.\n\nDuring the Soviet era, as the city was expanding, the number of raions also gradually increased. These newer districts of the city, along with some older areas were then named in honour of prominent communists and socialist-revolutionary figures; however, due to the way in which many communist party members eventually, after a certain period of time, fell out of favour and so were replaced with new, fresher minds, so too did the names of Kiev's districts change accordingly.\n\nThe last raion reform took place in 2001 when the number of raions has been decreased from 14 to 10.\n\nUnder [[Oleksandr Omelchenko]] ([[Mayor of Kiev|mayor]] from 1999 to 2006), there were further plans for the merger of some raions and revision of their boundaries, and the total number of raions had been planned to be decreased from 10 to 7. With the election of the new mayor-elect ([[Leonid Chernovetskyi|Leonid Chernovetsky]]) in 2006, these plans were shelved.\n\nEach raion has its own [[local government|locally elected government]] with jurisdiction over a limited scope of affairs.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{See also|Kiev metropolitan area}}\nAccording to the official [[Resident registration|registration]] statistics, there were 2,847,200 residents within the city limits of Kiev in July 2013.<ref name=\"Kiev statistical report\"/>\n\n===Historical population===\n{{Historical populations\n|state=collapsed\n|shading=on\n|10xx|100000\n|1647|15000\n|1666|10000\n|1763|42000\n|1797|19000\n|1835|36500\n|1845|50000\n|1856|56000\n|1865|71300\n|1874|127500\n|1884|154500\n|1897|247700\n|1905|450000\n|1909|468000\n|1912|442000\n|1914|626300\n|1917|430500\n|1919|544000\n|1922|366000\n|1923|413000\n|1926|513000\n|1930|578000\n|1940|930000\n|1943|180000\n|1956|991000\n|1959|1104300\n|1965|1367200\n|1970|1632000\n|1975|1947000\n|1980|2191500\n|1985|2461000\n|1991|2593400\n|1996|2637900\n|2000|2615300\n|2005|2596400\n|2010|2786518\n|2015|2890432\n|footnote=at 1 January of respective year.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Vilenchuk|first1=S.

There is also an [[Kiev Urban Electric Train|intra-city ring railway service]].\n\nThe publicly owned and operated Kiev Metro is the fastest, the most convenient and affordable network that covers most, but not all, of the city. The Metro is continuously expanding towards the city limits to meet growing demand, currently having three lines with a total length of {{convert|66.1|km|abbr=off}} and 51 stations (some of which are renowned architectural landmarks). The Metro carries around 1.422 million passengers daily<ref name=\"update\">{{in lang|uk}} [http://gorstat.kiev.ua/p.php3?c=2257&lang=1 Kyiv General Department of Statistics, 2011]</ref> accounting for 38% of the Kiev's public transport load. In 2011, the total number of trips exceeded 519 million.\n\nThe historic [[Kiev Tramway|Kiev tram system]] was the first electric tramway in the former Russian Empire and the third one in Europe after the [[Berlin Stra\u00dfenbahn]] and the [[Budapest]] tramway. The tram system currently consists of {{convert|139.9|km|mi|abbr=on}} of track,<ref>For a 2004 plan of the Kiev tram, please see [http://www.mashke.org/kievtram/history/schemes/2004/2004-tram.jpg mashke.org]</ref> including {{convert|14|km|mi|abbr=on}} two [[Kiev Light Rail|Rapid Tram]] lines, served by 21 routes with the use of 523 tram cars. Once a well maintained and widely used method of transport, the system is now gradually being phased out in favor of buses and trolleybuses.\n\nThe [[Kiev funicular]] was constructed during 1902\u20131905. It connects the historic [[Old Kiev|Uppertown]], and the lower commercial neighborhood of [[Podil]] through the steep [[Volodymyrska Hill]] overseeing the Dnieper River. The line consists of only two stations.\n\nAll public road transport (except for some minibuses) is operated by the united [[Kyivpastrans]] municipal company. It is heavily subsidized by the city.\n\nThe Kiev public transport system, except for taxi, uses a simple [[flat rate]] tariff system regardless of distance traveled: tickets or tokens must be purchased each time a vehicle is boarded. [[Digital ticket]] system is already established in Kiev Metro, with plans for other transport modes. Discount passes are available for grade school and higher education students. Pensioners use public transportation free. There are monthly passes in all combinations of public transportation. Ticket prices are regulated by the city government, and the cost of one ride is far lower than in Western Europe.\n\nThe [[Taxicab|taxi]] market in Kiev is expansive but not regulated. In particular, the taxi fare per kilometer is not regulated. There is a fierce competition between private taxi companies.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:\u0417\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0456 \u0412\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0430.jpg|[[Zoloti Vorota (Kiev Metro)|Zoloti Vorota Metro Station Cental Hall]]\nFile:Pozniaky metro station Kiev 2011 02.jpg|Pozniaky metro station\nFile:MAZ-215 Marshala Rokossovskoho avenue Kyiv 20190705.jpg|[[MAZ-215]] Bus in Kiev\nFile:17-07-02-Maidan Nezalezhnosti RR74409.jpg|Taxi and trolleybus \nFile:Kiev Funicular.jpeg|Kiev funicular\nFile:\u0424\u0443\u043d\u0456\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0435\u0440.jpg|Station of Kiev funicular\nFile:KyivTram2018.jpg|A modern Pesa Tram in Kiev\nFile:Podil's'kyi district, Kiev, Ukraine - panoramio (5).jpg|A ship near the [[Kiev River Port]] passenger terminal \nFile:\u041c\u0456\u0441\u0442 \u041f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0437 \u043d\u0456\u0447\u043d\u043e\u044e \u0430\u0440\u0445\u0456\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0440\u043d\u043e\u044e \u043f\u0456\u0434\u0441\u0432\u0456\u0442\u043a\u043e\u044e \u0442\u0430 \u043f\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u041b\u0456\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0433\u0430.jpg|[[Paton Bridge]], the world's first all-[[Welding|welded]] bridge\nFile:\u0414\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0446\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0456\u0441\u04422.jpg|The [[New Darnytskyi Bridge|Novo-Darnytskyi Bridge]] over the Dnieper river\nFile:\u041f\u0456\u0432\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0456\u0441\u0442 (\u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432).jpg|[[Pivdennyi Bridge (Kiev)|Pivdennyi (Southern) Bridge]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Roads and bridges===\nKiev represents the focal point of Ukraine's \"national roads\" system, thus linked by road to all cities of the country.

It is home to many [[High tech|high-tech]] industries, higher education institutions, and historical landmarks. The city has an extensive system of public transport and infrastructure, including the [[Kiev Metro]].\n\nThe city's name is said to derive from the name of [[Kyi, Shchek and Khoryv|Kyi]], one of its four legendary founders. During [[History of Kiev|its history]], Kiev, one of the oldest cities in Eastern Europe, passed through several stages of prominence and obscurity. The city probably existed as a commercial center as early as the 5th century. A [[Slavs|Slavic]] settlement on the great trade route between [[Scandinavia]] and [[Constantinople]], Kiev was a tributary of the [[Khazars]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/kiev|title=Kiev|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|accessdate=4 July 2015}}</ref> until its capture by the [[Varangians]] ([[Vikings]]) in the mid-9th century. Under Varangian rule, the city became a capital of the [[Kievan Rus']], the first [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] state. Completely destroyed during the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol invasions]] in 1240, the city lost most of its influence for the centuries to come. It was a provincial capital of marginal importance in the outskirts of the territories controlled by its powerful neighbours, first [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], then [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poland]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Kyiv|title=Kyiv - History|last=|first=|date=|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref>\n\nThe city prospered again during the [[Russian Empire]]'s [[Industrial Revolution]] in the late 19th century. In 1918, after the [[Ukrainian National Republic]] declared independence from [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]], Kiev became its capital. From 1921 onwards Kiev was a city of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], which was proclaimed by the [[Red Army]], and, from 1934, Kiev was its capital. The city was almost completely ruined during [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]] but quickly recovered in the postwar years, remaining the [[Soviet Union]]'s third-largest city.\n\nFollowing [[Collapse of the Soviet Union (1985\u20131991)|the collapse of the Soviet Union]] and [[History of Ukraine|Ukrainian independence]] in 1991, Kiev remained Ukraine's capital and experienced a steady influx of ethnic Ukrainian migrants from other regions of the country.<ref name=\"History of Ukraine\">{{cite book|last=Magocsi|first=Paul Robert|title=A History of Ukraine: The Land and Its Peoples|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0mKRsElYNkC&pg=PT481|edition=2nd, Revised|year=2010|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-1-4426-9879-6|page=481}}</ref> During the country's transformation to a [[market economy]] and [[electoral democracy]], Kiev has continued to be Ukraine's largest and wealthiest city.

Scattered [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] settlements existed in the area from the 6th century, but it is unclear whether any of them later developed into the city. The ''Primary Chronicle'' (a main source of information about the early history of the area) mentions Slavic Kievans telling [[Askold and Dir]] that they lived without a local ruler and paid a tribute to the Khazars in an entry attributed to the 9th century. At least during the 8th and 9th centuries Kiev functioned as an outpost of the Khazar empire. A hill-fortress, called Sambat (Old Turkic for \"High Place\") was built to defend the area. At some point during the late 9th or early 10th century Kiev fell under the rule of [[Varangians]] (see [[Askold and Dir]], and [[Oleg of Novgorod]]) and became the nucleus of the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] polity. The ''Primary Chronicle'' dates Oleg's conquest of the town in 882, but some historians, such as [[Omeljan Pritsak]] and [[Constantine Zuckerman]], dispute this and maintain that Khazar rule continued as late as the 920s (documentary evidence exists to support this assertion \u2013 see the [[Kievian Letter]] and [[Schechter Letter]]). Other historians suggest that Magyar tribes ruled the city between 840 and 878, before migrating with some [[Khazars|Khazar]] tribes to [[Hungary]]. According to these scholars the building of the fortress of Kiev was finished in 840 under the leadership of Ke\u0151 (Keve), Cs\u00e1k and Ger\u00e9b, the three brothers, possibly members of the [[Tarj\u00e1n tribe]]. The three names appear in the Kiev Chronicle as [[Kyi, Shchek and Khoryv]] \u2013 none of these names are Slavic, and Russian historians have always struggled to account for their meanings and origins. Their names were put into the Kiev Chronicle in the 12th century and they were identified as old-Russian mythological heroes.<ref>dr.

In 1892 the [[Kiev tram|first electric tram line]] of the Russian Empire started running in Kiev (the 3rd in the world).\n\nKiev prospered during the late 19th century [[Industrial Revolution]] in the [[Russian Empire]], when it became the third most important city of the Empire and the major centre of commerce of its southwest. In the [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution|turbulent period]] following the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|1917 Russian Revolution]], Kiev became the capital of several [[Ukrainian People's Republic|successive Ukrainian states]] and was caught in the middle of several conflicts: [[World War I]], during which German soldiers occupied it from 2 March 1918 to November 1918, the [[Russian Civil War]] of 1917 to 1922, and the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] of 1919\u20131921. During the last three months of 1919, Kiev was intermittently controlled by the [[White Army]]. Kiev changed hands sixteen times from the end of 1918 to August 1920.<ref>{{cite book |title= Walking Since Daybreak|url= https://archive.org/details/walkingsincedayb0000ekst|url-access= registration|last= Eksteins|first= Modris|year= 1999|publisher= [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]]|isbn= 0-618-08231-X|page= [https://archive.org/details/walkingsincedayb0000ekst/page/87 87]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Kiev Radyanskaya pl approx1930.jpg|thumb|right|Kiev's council chambers in 1930]]\nFrom 1921 to 1991 the city formed part of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], which became a founding republic of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1922.

The [[Chernobyl disaster|catastrophic accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] in 1986 occurred only {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of the city. However, the prevailing northward winds blew most of the radioactive debris away from Kiev.\n\nIn the course of the [[Collapse of the Soviet Union (1985\u20131991)|collapse of the Soviet Union]] the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian parliament]] proclaimed the [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine]] in the city on 24 August 1991. In 2004\u20132005, the city played host to the largest post-Soviet public demonstrations up to that time, in support of the [[Orange Revolution]]. From November 2013 until February 2014, central Kiev became the primary location of [[Euromaidan]].\n\n==Environment==\n{{see also|Kiev Mountains}}\n\n===Geography===\n[[File:Kiev L7 20010914.jpg|thumb|left|[[Landsat 7]] image of Kiev and the [[Dnieper]]]]\nGeographically, Kiev is located on the border of the [[Polesia]] woodland ecological zone, a part of the European mixed woods area, and the East European [[forest steppe]] [[biome]]. However, the city's unique landscape distinguishes it from the surrounding region. Kiev is completely surrounded by [[Kiev Oblast]].\n\nOriginally on the west bank, today Kiev is located on both sides of the [[Dnieper]], which flows southwards through the city towards the [[Black Sea]]. The older and higher western part of the city sits on numerous wooded hills ([[Kiev Mountains|Kiev Hills]]), with ravines and small rivers. Kiev's geographical relief contributed to its [[toponym]]s, such as Podil (means lower), Pechersk (caves), and uzviz (a steep street, \"descent\"). Kiev is a part of the larger [[Dnieper Upland]] adjoining the western bank of the Dnieper in its mid-flow, and which contributes to the city's elevation change. The northern outskirts of the city border the [[Polesian Lowland]]. Kiev expanded into the [[Dnieper Lowland]] on the left bank (''to the east'') as late as the 20th century. The whole portion of Kiev on the left bank of the Dnieper is generally referred to as ''Left bank'' ({{lang-uk|\u041b\u0456\u0432\u0438\u0439 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0433}}, Livyi bereh). Significant areas of the left bank Dnieper valley were artificially sand-deposited, and are protected by dams.\n\nWithin the city the Dnieper River forms a branching system of [[tributary|tributaries]], isles, and harbors within the city limits. The city is close to the mouth of the [[Desna River]] and the [[Kiev Reservoir]] in the north, and the [[Kaniv Reservoir]] in the south. Both the Dnieper and Desna rivers are [[navigation|navigable]] at Kiev, although regulated by the reservoir shipping locks and limited by winter freeze-over.\n\nIn total, there are 448 bodies of open water within the boundaries of Kiev, which include the Dnieper itself, its reservoirs, and several small rivers, dozens of lakes and artificially created ponds. They occupy 7949 hectares. Additionally, the city has 16 developed beaches (totalling 140 hectares) and 35 near-water recreational areas (covering more than 1,000 hectares). Many are used for pleasure and recreation, although some of the bodies of water are not suitable for swimming.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Design by Maxim Tkachuk |author2=web-architecture by Volkova Dasha |author3=templated by Alexey Kovtanets |author4=programming by Irina Batvina |author5=Maxim Bielushkin |author6=Sergey Bogatyrchuk |author7=Vitaliy Galkin |author8=Victor Lushkin |author9=Dmitry Medun |author10=Igor Sitnikov |author11=Vladimir Tarasov |author12=Alexander Filippov |author13=Sergei Koshelev |url=http://korrespondent.net/kyiv/155583 |title=\u0413\u0434\u0435 \u0432 \u041a\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0435 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \" \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0432 \u041a\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0435 \u2013 \u041a\u043e\u0440\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442 |publisher=Korrespondent.net |accessdate=23 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[UN]] 2011 evaluation, there were no risks of [[natural disaster]]s in Kiev and [[Kiev metropolitan area|its metropolitan area]]<ref name=\"UN Urban agglomerations types of natural risks\">{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/unpd/wup/CD-ROM/WUP2011-F23-City_Risk_Natural-Disasters.xls |title=Urban agglomerations with 750,000 inhabitants or more in 2011 and types of natural risks |publisher=United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division |date=April 2012 |accessdate=1 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006152606/http://esa.un.org/unpd/wup/CD-ROM/WUP2011-F23-City_Risk_Natural-Disasters.xls |archivedate=6 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\n\nKiev has a warm-summer [[continental climate|humid continental]] [[climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfb'').<ref>{{cite journal| last = Kottek | first = M.|author2=J.

In 1833\u20131834 according to [[Russian tsar|Tsar]] [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]'s decree, Kiev was subdivided into 6 police [[raion]]s (districts); later being increased to 10. In 1917, there were 8 Raion Councils (''Duma''), which were reorganised by [[bolshevik]]s into 6 Party-Territory Raions.\n\nDuring the Soviet era, as the city was expanding, the number of raions also gradually increased. These newer districts of the city, along with some older areas were then named in honour of prominent communists and socialist-revolutionary figures; however, due to the way in which many communist party members eventually, after a certain period of time, fell out of favour and so were replaced with new, fresher minds, so too did the names of Kiev's districts change accordingly.\n\nThe last raion reform took place in 2001 when the number of raions has been decreased from 14 to 10.\n\nUnder [[Oleksandr Omelchenko]] ([[Mayor of Kiev|mayor]] from 1999 to 2006), there were further plans for the merger of some raions and revision of their boundaries, and the total number of raions had been planned to be decreased from 10 to 7. With the election of the new mayor-elect ([[Leonid Chernovetskyi|Leonid Chernovetsky]]) in 2006, these plans were shelved.\n\nEach raion has its own [[local government|locally elected government]] with jurisdiction over a limited scope of affairs.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{See also|Kiev metropolitan area}}\nAccording to the official [[Resident registration|registration]] statistics, there were 2,847,200 residents within the city limits of Kiev in July 2013.<ref name=\"Kiev statistical report\"/>\n\n===Historical population===\n{{Historical populations\n|state=collapsed\n|shading=on\n|10xx|100000\n|1647|15000\n|1666|10000\n|1763|42000\n|1797|19000\n|1835|36500\n|1845|50000\n|1856|56000\n|1865|71300\n|1874|127500\n|1884|154500\n|1897|247700\n|1905|450000\n|1909|468000\n|1912|442000\n|1914|626300\n|1917|430500\n|1919|544000\n|1922|366000\n|1923|413000\n|1926|513000\n|1930|578000\n|1940|930000\n|1943|180000\n|1956|991000\n|1959|1104300\n|1965|1367200\n|1970|1632000\n|1975|1947000\n|1980|2191500\n|1985|2461000\n|1991|2593400\n|1996|2637900\n|2000|2615300\n|2005|2596400\n|2010|2786518\n|2015|2890432\n|footnote=at 1 January of respective year.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Vilenchuk|first1=S.

Pensioners use public transportation free. There are monthly passes in all combinations of public transportation. Ticket prices are regulated by the city government, and the cost of one ride is far lower than in Western Europe.\n\nThe [[Taxicab|taxi]] market in Kiev is expansive but not regulated.

He is an NCIS [[Special Agent in Charge]], and the senior agent assigned to the Office of Special Projects. O'Donnell made his first appearance during ''NCIS''{{'}} sixth-season episode \"Legend (Part 1)\".\n\n== Background ==\nBefore working at NCIS, Callen previously worked for the CIA, DEA and FBI.  Several episodes across the seasons reference his stint with the Agency and in seasons one and two, it is revealed that whilst with the CIA, Callen worked alongside recurring ''NCIS'' character, Trent Kort ([[David Dayan Fisher]]), and was partnered with Tracy Rosetti ([[Marisol Nichols]]).  As part of their undercover mission in Uzbekistan, Callen and Tracy \"married\", using the surname Keller. Following this mission, where Callen accused Tracy of placing the success of the operation above both their professional and personal partnerships, the two 'divorced', with Callen joking that in the settlement Tracy received custody of Buddy, their dog. The marriage and subsequent divorce were of course fake.  In season one, Callen is revealed to have worked with the DEA (on a joint operation with the CIA, where he first met Arkady Kolchek) and the FBI.\n\nCallen once served with his good friend [[Leroy Jethro Gibbs]], who now works at the NCIS Headquarters located in the [[Washington Navy Yard]]. Callen specializes in deep undercover work.  Prior to the series commencing, G. Callen and Sam Hanna had been partnered for two years (as per the season three episode \"Partner\") where they celebrate their five-year partnership.\n\nG. Callen grew up in foster care, never knowing who his parents were or even his first name.  In the show's first episode \"Identity\", it is revealed that he is called \"G\" not because he dislikes his first name, but because he does not actually know what it stands for, as the system never told him. Further insights in to his childhood come in season one's \"Pushback\", where Hetty Lange and Operational Psychologist Dr Nate Getz discuss how Callen lived in thirty seven foster homes from the age of five to the age of eighteen, sometimes moving every few days.  The longest he ever stayed in one place was for three months at fourteen, when he lived with the family of a Russian girl named Alina Rostoff (whom he called \"little sister\").  A flashback in the finale of season one forces Callen to recall he had an older sister who unfortunately died by drowning in a river.

During the season six episode Rage, an undercover operation in prison sees him encounter a youth whose situation causes him to recall his troubled teenage years.  Callen ran away from his last foster family, was arrested for robbing a storage locker and sent to a juvenile detention center, which he described as hell.

George Callen was [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] (which later became the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]) and hunted Romanian war criminals after WWII and killed Comescus.

The real Amy had died at the age of 11 when the two friends sneaked out at night to play in the nearby river, and Amy had been swept away in an accident.

The same list showed the various orphanages and foster homes where the real and fake Amy, including the last foster home where Amy (aka Hannah) stayed for many years, indicating this person did not know about the switch between Hannah and Amy. In season 3 \"Deadline\", Callen discovers that Hetty had kept an eye on him during his youth (confirmed in season 6 \"Rage\"), and also knew his sister died. But in season 5's \"Reznikov, N.\" it is revealed that Hans Schreiber also kept track of Callen's life, as a favor to Callen's father. It has not been confirmed who actually wrote the list of foster homes and orphanages however it is assumed that he wrote the list as Nate Getz analysed the list as having been written with an aging hand, as and when the changes of homes took place.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\nIn the season two premiere \"Human Traffic\", Hetty makes arrangements for Callen to purchase a house of his own\u2014the very same house where he lived with Alina Rostoff as a foster child.\n\nThe second season mostly revolves around Callen, who has been stalked by someone he does not know. He sees someone near the grave of his sister, and over the course of the season, runs into people who seem to know more about his past than he does. When Hetty resigns and takes off to [[Prague]], Callen finds out from Director Vance that Hetty has started her own investigation, Operation Comescu, which is all about Callen. Callen and the team then resign too when Vance refuses to fly them to Prague to get Hetty. Arriving in Prague, the team discovers that Hetty has been taken by the Comescus and that the Comescus have been in a decades-long [[blood feud]] with the Callens, of which G is the last one. The team tracks their safe house down to a house on the beach, and Callen starts to remember things from his past, as he realizes he has been on this beach before. Inside the house, Hetty fails to convince Alexa Comescu, the matriarch of the Comescu family, that Callen died three weeks ago, showing her a clip of the attempted assassination and a death certificate.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\nIn the third-season premiere, \"[[List of NCIS: Los Angeles episodes#ep25|Lange, H.]]\", it is revealed that Callen's grandfather was an [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] agent stationed in Romania. In the third-season episode number 4 \"Deadline\", Hetty Lange reveals to Callen that his grandfather was named George Callen and that he parachuted into Romania during the War, and at the end took part in hunting those guilty of war crimes, he subsequently found and killed several members of the Comescu family. In 1947 he met and married a 'Roma Girl' (Callen's grandmother, name unknown). George Callen was murdered by the Comescu family. The remainder of Callen's family (his grandmother and her daughter, Callen's mother, Clara) fled to America where years later Clara was recruited by the CIA. She returned to Romania and then a year later vanished for six years. The Comescu family had not forgotten their grudge and came looking for the Callens. One of Callen's most vivid memories of his childhood is of being given a toy soldier by a stranger while he played on the beach. He realizes that the beach is not in California as he had always assumed, but on the [[Black Sea]] coast, and that the toy was given to him to distract him while a Comescu assassin killed his mother. It is never explained why the Comescu family let Callen and his sister live, though Alexa Comescu describes it as \"a mistake\". Callen confronts Alexa, both holding guns on each other, and Alexa claims to know everything about him.  Her words persuade him to lower his weapon providing Alexa the opportunity she needs to kill the last Callen.  Before she can pull the trigger, Hunter shoots her dead.\n\nBack in LA, Hunter is the acting Operations Manager until Hetty returns to work after sustaining a gunshot during Operation Comescu. Callen does not trust Hunter and wants to know more about himself and what was on the laptop that she retrieved at the Comescu house. Hunter later tells him that all the contents of the laptop were concerning the family's illegal activities and not about Callen. Hetty later returns when Hunter leaves for another undercover operation in Europe and offers to tell Callen everything starting with the reason she was trying to protect him: she had failed to protect his mother. She then gives him his mother's name: Clara. She also tells him that his mother was a CIA agent and that Hetty had been her handler when Clara had gone back on assignment to Romania. After a year of the mission, Clara vanished for six years and resurfaced with two children, desperate to get out of Romania. Hetty had been sent to meet her on the beach where the Comescus killed her. She also says that she doesn't know how he and his sister came to the U.S. and that she had no idea who his father is but that she was the one responsible for getting him out of the orphanage and into foster homes.\n\nIn the third-season finale, \"[[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 3)#ep72|Sans Voir]]\", Agent Mike Renko and former Operations Manager Lauren Hunter are both murdered at the hands of Marcel Janvier, also known as \"The Chameleon\". Callen appears to gun down Janvier following a prisoner exchange. The episode ends with Callen being arrested by LAPD and Hetty resigning her position at OSP.\n\n=== Season 4 ===\nA series of flashbacks in the season four opening episode \"Endgame\" reveal that Janvier's death was faked. After Janvier and Callen are traded back to their respective sides in a prisoner exchange, Callen\u2014following his fake suspension\u2014returns to lead the OSP team once again. Janvier returns again at the end of season 4.\n\n=== Season 5 ===\nIn the season 5 opener, Janvier reminds Callen that he will be seeking his revenge, even if he has to wait many years to exact it.\n\nIn the season five episode \"[[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 5)#ep100|Reznikov, N.]]\", a man named Michael Reinhardt appears. Reinhardt claims that his true name is Nikita Alexsandr Reznikov and that he is Callen's father. He is kidnapped and killed by one of the surviving members of the Comescu family, Vasile. At the end of the episode, Hetty and Arkady Kolcheck explain to Callen that the real Reznikov was a KGB major who was arrested and sent to a Soviet gulag in 1974, around the time Callen and his sister came to America. Reinhardt (actually named Hans Schreiber) was a former East German who owed Reznikov a favor and repaid it by keeping track of Callen and his sister. The Comescus mistook him for Reznikov, who kept up the ruse to protect Callen. In Reinhardt's house, Deeks discovered an 8&nbsp;mm film of Callen and Amy playing with Reznikov. Hetty gave it to Callen.\n\nIn \"War Cries\", Sam, Michelle, and Hetty set Callen up on a blind date with Joelle Taylor, a friend of the Hannas and their daughter's former kindergarten teacher. Both aware of the trick, they nevertheless get on well although Callen immediately makes up a fake career to protect his role. Throughout season five, Joelle is mentioned as Callen's girlfriend.\n\n=== Season 6 ===\nIn \"Humbug\", an armed robber threatens Joelle in public after stealing some malware from a defense contractor. When it is learned that the robber placed the stolen malware on Joelle, Callen is forced to put himself in danger to protect her, eventually being forced to reveal to her that he is an NCIS agent. Although she appears hurt by this revelation of Callen's deception, she eventually accepts to continue their relationship as long as he tells her more about himself. Callen and Joelle are confirmed to be still together by both Sam and Callen himself. Callen later tells the team he would not be against starting a family with Joelle.\n\nCallen realises Arkady Kolchek knows more about his father than he's revealed. When a mission to find a ship with stolen barrels of oil leads to Russia, Arkady accompanies the team. Whilst there, Arkady takes Callen to a coffee shop and shows him a photo of Callen's father (Reznikov) from the 1980s, long after he was supposedly sent to the Gulag. Through Eric's hacking, Hetty discovers that Reznikov took the name of Chernoff. Callen realises he was working in Moscow at the same time his father frequented the city.\n\n=== Season 7 ===\nIn season seven, Callen admits that he and Joelle are fighting a lot. They break up off screen but still spend Christmas together to avoid being lonely. In \"Matryoshka, Part 2\", Callen meets Reznikov in Russia. He reveals that Callen's birth name is Grisha Aleksandrovich Nikolaev, but has to leave before he could find out any more information. Callen has since updated his personnel records and credentials with his full name.<ref name=\"Where There's Smoke\"/>\n\n=== Season 8 ===\nCallen reunites with Reznikov in \"Glasnost\", where he shoots a man who went after a woman victim he was visiting and reveals he had been in touch with Arkady Kolcheck since the Russia incident back in Season Seven. Callen interrogates his father, who admits he's in LA for work\u2014not to see his son. After Hetty takes over the interrogation, she allows Reznikov to escape to finish what he started. Callen and Sam go to his rescue, and Callen discovers that Reznikov helped a woman move to the U.S. and fathered a child with her. That child has since become a parent, so Callen has a half-sister and is now an uncle. In the episode \"Payback\", Callen learns from Hetty that Joelle is an undercover CIA agent who has been assigned by rogue agency moles to spy on him. Feeling betrayed, Callen permanently severs his ties with Joelle.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{NCIS television}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Callen, G.}}\n[[Category:Fictional American people of Russian descent]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2009]]\n[[Category:Fictional Central Intelligence Agency personnel]]\n[[Category:Fictional Drug Enforcement Administration personnel]]\n[[Category:Fictional immigrants to the United States]]\n[[Category:Fictional Naval Criminal Investigative Service personnel]]\n[[Category:Fictional Romanian people]]\n[[Category:Fictional secret agents and spies]]\n[[Category:NCIS (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:NCIS: Los Angeles characters]]\n[[Category:Crossover characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{in-universe|date=April 2016}}\n{{primary sources|date=April 2016}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Grisha  \"G.\" Callen\n| series             = [[NCIS: Los Angeles]]\n| image              = G-callen-promo-pic.jpg\n| alt                = \n| caption            = Chris O'Donnell as G.

He is an NCIS [[Special Agent in Charge]], and the senior agent assigned to the Office of Special Projects. O'Donnell made his first appearance during ''NCIS''{{'}} sixth-season episode \"Legend (Part 1)\".\n\n== Background ==\nBefore working at NCIS, Callen previously worked for the CIA, DEA and FBI.  Several episodes across the seasons reference his stint with the Agency and in seasons one and two, it is revealed that whilst with the CIA, Callen worked alongside recurring ''NCIS'' character, Trent Kort ([[David Dayan Fisher]]), and was partnered with Tracy Rosetti ([[Marisol Nichols]]).  As part of their undercover mission in Uzbekistan, Callen and Tracy \"married\", using the surname Keller. Following this mission, where Callen accused Tracy of placing the success of the operation above both their professional and personal partnerships, the two 'divorced', with Callen joking that in the settlement Tracy received custody of Buddy, their dog. The marriage and subsequent divorce were of course fake.  In season one, Callen is revealed to have worked with the DEA (on a joint operation with the CIA, where he first met Arkady Kolchek) and the FBI.\n\nCallen once served with his good friend [[Leroy Jethro Gibbs]], who now works at the NCIS Headquarters located in the [[Washington Navy Yard]]. Callen specializes in deep undercover work.  Prior to the series commencing, G. Callen and Sam Hanna had been partnered for two years (as per the season three episode \"Partner\") where they celebrate their five-year partnership.\n\nG. Callen grew up in foster care, never knowing who his parents were or even his first name.  In the show's first episode \"Identity\", it is revealed that he is called \"G\" not because he dislikes his first name, but because he does not actually know what it stands for, as the system never told him. Further insights in to his childhood come in season one's \"Pushback\", where Hetty Lange and Operational Psychologist Dr Nate Getz discuss how Callen lived in thirty seven foster homes from the age of five to the age of eighteen, sometimes moving every few days.  The longest he ever stayed in one place was for three months at fourteen, when he lived with the family of a Russian girl named Alina Rostoff (whom he called \"little sister\").  A flashback in the finale of season one forces Callen to recall he had an older sister who unfortunately died by drowning in a river.  She was buried with the name of Hannah Lawson, whilst the real Hannah lived with the assumed name of her dead foster friend, Amy Callen.  It has not yet been revealed why the two siblings were split up and sent to opposite sides of America, although it can be assumed this was on instruction of their father, in order to keep them safe from the Comescu family.\n\nCallen's childhood was fraught with abuse which is referenced during various episodes.  He readily identifies with characters who share a similar upbringing, understanding why kids join gangs or the military and knows exactly where runaway teens gather in LA.

The same list showed the various orphanages and foster homes where the real and fake Amy, including the last foster home where Amy (aka Hannah) stayed for many years, indicating this person did not know about the switch between Hannah and Amy. In season 3 \"Deadline\", Callen discovers that Hetty had kept an eye on him during his youth (confirmed in season 6 \"Rage\"), and also knew his sister died. But in season 5's \"Reznikov, N.\" it is revealed that Hans Schreiber also kept track of Callen's life, as a favor to Callen's father. It has not been confirmed who actually wrote the list of foster homes and orphanages however it is assumed that he wrote the list as Nate Getz analysed the list as having been written with an aging hand, as and when the changes of homes took place.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\nIn the season two premiere \"Human Traffic\", Hetty makes arrangements for Callen to purchase a house of his own\u2014the very same house where he lived with Alina Rostoff as a foster child.\n\nThe second season mostly revolves around Callen, who has been stalked by someone he does not know. He sees someone near the grave of his sister, and over the course of the season, runs into people who seem to know more about his past than he does. When Hetty resigns and takes off to [[Prague]], Callen finds out from Director Vance that Hetty has started her own investigation, Operation Comescu, which is all about Callen. Callen and the team then resign too when Vance refuses to fly them to Prague to get Hetty. Arriving in Prague, the team discovers that Hetty has been taken by the Comescus and that the Comescus have been in a decades-long [[blood feud]] with the Callens, of which G is the last one. The team tracks their safe house down to a house on the beach, and Callen starts to remember things from his past, as he realizes he has been on this beach before. Inside the house, Hetty fails to convince Alexa Comescu, the matriarch of the Comescu family, that Callen died three weeks ago, showing her a clip of the attempted assassination and a death certificate.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\nIn the third-season premiere, \"[[List of NCIS: Los Angeles episodes#ep25|Lange, H.]]\", it is revealed that Callen's grandfather was an [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] agent stationed in Romania. In the third-season episode number 4 \"Deadline\", Hetty Lange reveals to Callen that his grandfather was named George Callen and that he parachuted into Romania during the War, and at the end took part in hunting those guilty of war crimes, he subsequently found and killed several members of the Comescu family. In 1947 he met and married a 'Roma Girl' (Callen's grandmother, name unknown). George Callen was murdered by the Comescu family. The remainder of Callen's family (his grandmother and her daughter, Callen's mother, Clara) fled to America where years later Clara was recruited by the CIA. She returned to Romania and then a year later vanished for six years. The Comescu family had not forgotten their grudge and came looking for the Callens. One of Callen's most vivid memories of his childhood is of being given a toy soldier by a stranger while he played on the beach. He realizes that the beach is not in California as he had always assumed, but on the [[Black Sea]] coast, and that the toy was given to him to distract him while a Comescu assassin killed his mother. It is never explained why the Comescu family let Callen and his sister live, though Alexa Comescu describes it as \"a mistake\". Callen confronts Alexa, both holding guns on each other, and Alexa claims to know everything about him.  Her words persuade him to lower his weapon providing Alexa the opportunity she needs to kill the last Callen.  Before she can pull the trigger, Hunter shoots her dead.\n\nBack in LA, Hunter is the acting Operations Manager until Hetty returns to work after sustaining a gunshot during Operation Comescu. Callen does not trust Hunter and wants to know more about himself and what was on the laptop that she retrieved at the Comescu house. Hunter later tells him that all the contents of the laptop were concerning the family's illegal activities and not about Callen. Hetty later returns when Hunter leaves for another undercover operation in Europe and offers to tell Callen everything starting with the reason she was trying to protect him: she had failed to protect his mother. She then gives him his mother's name: Clara. She also tells him that his mother was a CIA agent and that Hetty had been her handler when Clara had gone back on assignment to Romania. After a year of the mission, Clara vanished for six years and resurfaced with two children, desperate to get out of Romania. Hetty had been sent to meet her on the beach where the Comescus killed her. She also says that she doesn't know how he and his sister came to the U.S. and that she had no idea who his father is but that she was the one responsible for getting him out of the orphanage and into foster homes.\n\nIn the third-season finale, \"[[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 3)#ep72|Sans Voir]]\", Agent Mike Renko and former Operations Manager Lauren Hunter are both murdered at the hands of Marcel Janvier, also known as \"The Chameleon\". Callen appears to gun down Janvier following a prisoner exchange. The episode ends with Callen being arrested by LAPD and Hetty resigning her position at OSP.\n\n=== Season 4 ===\nA series of flashbacks in the season four opening episode \"Endgame\" reveal that Janvier's death was faked. After Janvier and Callen are traded back to their respective sides in a prisoner exchange, Callen\u2014following his fake suspension\u2014returns to lead the OSP team once again. Janvier returns again at the end of season 4.\n\n=== Season 5 ===\nIn the season 5 opener, Janvier reminds Callen that he will be seeking his revenge, even if he has to wait many years to exact it.\n\nIn the season five episode \"[[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 5)#ep100|Reznikov, N.]]\", a man named Michael Reinhardt appears. Reinhardt claims that his true name is Nikita Alexsandr Reznikov and that he is Callen's father. He is kidnapped and killed by one of the surviving members of the Comescu family, Vasile. At the end of the episode, Hetty and Arkady Kolcheck explain to Callen that the real Reznikov was a KGB major who was arrested and sent to a Soviet gulag in 1974, around the time Callen and his sister came to America. Reinhardt (actually named Hans Schreiber) was a former East German who owed Reznikov a favor and repaid it by keeping track of Callen and his sister. The Comescus mistook him for Reznikov, who kept up the ruse to protect Callen. In Reinhardt's house, Deeks discovered an 8&nbsp;mm film of Callen and Amy playing with Reznikov. Hetty gave it to Callen.\n\nIn \"War Cries\", Sam, Michelle, and Hetty set Callen up on a blind date with Joelle Taylor, a friend of the Hannas and their daughter's former kindergarten teacher. Both aware of the trick, they nevertheless get on well although Callen immediately makes up a fake career to protect his role. Throughout season five, Joelle is mentioned as Callen's girlfriend.\n\n=== Season 6 ===\nIn \"Humbug\", an armed robber threatens Joelle in public after stealing some malware from a defense contractor. When it is learned that the robber placed the stolen malware on Joelle, Callen is forced to put himself in danger to protect her, eventually being forced to reveal to her that he is an NCIS agent. Although she appears hurt by this revelation of Callen's deception, she eventually accepts to continue their relationship as long as he tells her more about himself. Callen and Joelle are confirmed to be still together by both Sam and Callen himself. Callen later tells the team he would not be against starting a family with Joelle.\n\nCallen realises Arkady Kolchek knows more about his father than he's revealed. When a mission to find a ship with stolen barrels of oil leads to Russia, Arkady accompanies the team. Whilst there, Arkady takes Callen to a coffee shop and shows him a photo of Callen's father (Reznikov) from the 1980s, long after he was supposedly sent to the Gulag. Through Eric's hacking, Hetty discovers that Reznikov took the name of Chernoff. Callen realises he was working in Moscow at the same time his father frequented the city.\n\n=== Season 7 ===\nIn season seven, Callen admits that he and Joelle are fighting a lot. They break up off screen but still spend Christmas together to avoid being lonely. In \"Matryoshka, Part 2\", Callen meets Reznikov in Russia. He reveals that Callen's birth name is Grisha Aleksandrovich Nikolaev, but has to leave before he could find out any more information. Callen has since updated his personnel records and credentials with his full name.<ref name=\"Where There's Smoke\"/>\n\n=== Season 8 ===\nCallen reunites with Reznikov in \"Glasnost\", where he shoots a man who went after a woman victim he was visiting and reveals he had been in touch with Arkady Kolcheck since the Russia incident back in Season Seven. Callen interrogates his father, who admits he's in LA for work\u2014not to see his son. After Hetty takes over the interrogation, she allows Reznikov to escape to finish what he started. Callen and Sam go to his rescue, and Callen discovers that Reznikov helped a woman move to the U.S. and fathered a child with her. That child has since become a parent, so Callen has a half-sister and is now an uncle. In the episode \"Payback\", Callen learns from Hetty that Joelle is an undercover CIA agent who has been assigned by rogue agency moles to spy on him. Feeling betrayed, Callen permanently severs his ties with Joelle.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{NCIS television}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Callen, G.}}\n[[Category:Fictional American people of Russian descent]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2009]]\n[[Category:Fictional Central Intelligence Agency personnel]]\n[[Category:Fictional Drug Enforcement Administration personnel]]\n[[Category:Fictional immigrants to the United States]]\n[[Category:Fictional Naval Criminal Investigative Service personnel]]\n[[Category:Fictional Romanian people]]\n[[Category:Fictional secret agents and spies]]\n[[Category:NCIS (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:NCIS: Los Angeles characters]]\n[[Category:Crossover characters in television]]\n", "name_user": "Lover of crimance", "label": "safe", "comment": "Nationality", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._Callen"}

Death is often a boss fought toward the end of the game. He is considered Dracula's second-in-command and most trusted minion. Sometimes he has played an important role to the storyline, such as ''[[Castlevania: Lament of Innocence]]''. He is a playable character as the skeletal knight in ''[[Castlevania Judgment]]''.\n\nIn most of his appearances, Death closely resembles the cultural personification of the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]], being a legless skeleton in a hooded cloak with a [[scythe]]. Like Dracula, but in a lot fewer games, he can change into a second form upon being defeated in the game.\n\nHe is voiced by Dennis Falt in ''Symphony of the Night'', Patrick Seitz in ''The Dracula X Chronicles'' and ''Order of Ecclesia'', [[Douglas Rye]] in ''Judgment'' and [[Tom Wyner]] in earlier games. Death also appears in the 2018 crossover [[fighting game]] ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' as a stage character.<ref name=\"SmashBros\"/>\n\nThe character of Zobek, Lord of the Dead (voiced by [[Patrick Stewart]]) in the reboot ''Castlevania: Lords of Shadow'' has been speculated to be the version of Death of this universe, due to his relationship with Dracula. Additionally, the Lord of the Necromancers is at one point referred to as \"Death itself\". In the game's [[Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2|sequel]], when Gabriel Belmont is forced into a confrontation with Zobek sheds his human form and takes on a more traditionalized appearance of Death (including wielding a large scythe).\n\n===Simon Belmont===\n[[File:CVGoS Simon Belmont.png|thumb|right|Simon Belmont is the first protagonist to appear in the ''Castlevania'' series.]]\n{{nihongo|'''Simon Belmont'''|\u30b7\u30e2\u30f3\u30fb\u30d9\u30eb\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9|Shimon Berumondo|Simon Belmondo}} is the first protagonist to appear in the series. He has appeared in ''[[Castlevania (1986 video game)|Castlevania]]'', ''[[Vampire Killer]]'', ''[[Haunted Castle (video game)|Haunted Castle]]'', ''[[Castlevania II: Simon's Quest]]'', ''[[Super Castlevania IV]]'', ''[[Castlevania Chronicles]]'', ''[[Castlevania Judgment]]'', and ''[[Castlevania: Harmony of Despair]]''.\n\nSimon initially kills Dracula in the year 1691, an event that is told in multiple games (''[[Castlevania (1986 video game)|Castlevania]]'', ''[[Vampire Killer]]'', ''[[Haunted Castle (video game)|Haunted Castle]]'', ''[[Super Castlevania IV]]'', and ''[[Castlevania Chronicles]]''). In ''Castlevania II: Simon's Quest'', it is revealed that Dracula placed a curse on Simon and all of Transylvania after he was defeated by him. To break the curse, Simon must gather the remains of Dracula in order to burn them at the ruins of Dracula's castle &ndash; though the fact that this will cause Dracula to return is unknown to Simon (Dracula's Fang). In the best and canonical ending, Simon breaks the curse, and Transylvania recognizes his bravery, though it is hinted that Dracula will inevitably return, as his skinless hand rises from his grave. Simon is one of only two Belmonts to have faced Dracula twice in his lifetime, the other being his ancestor Christopher. \n\nIn ''[[Haunted Castle (video game)|Haunted Castle]]'', Simon is blue-haired and has a wife called Selena, who is kidnapped by Dracula directly after their marriage. It is actually unknown if this is Simon at all. The guide to the game calls him Simons, a descendant of the canonical  Simon, while a newsletter by Konami itself names him William. <ref>{{cite video|title=Game Simulation Video series: Akumaj\u014d Dracula (arcade version)|language=Japanese|url=http://castlevaniadungeon.net/Images/Scans/HC/hctape.jpg}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Simon is the first Belmont to appear in a Castlevania game, in the Belmont lineage, [[Leon Belmont]] originates the direct bloodline of the clan. It can then be presumed that he is followed by Trevor, Christopher, Soleil, Simon, Juste, Richter, and then Julius. In ''[[Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance]]'', Simon is playable in the Boss Rush mode, looking exactly as he did in ''[[Castlevania (1986 video game)|Castlevania]]''. In ''[[Castlevania: Harmony of Despair]]'', Simon is an extra character purchased as downloadable content, the sprite from the original game also being reused here. A special stage that recreates the game's castle layout can also be purchased.\n\nSimon Belmont appears in the rebooted series ''[[Castlevania: Lords of Shadow \u2013 Mirror of Fate]]'' (voiced by [[Alec Newman]]), as the son of Trevor Belmont, and grandson of Gabriel Belmont, later known as Dracula. He seeks revenge for the murder of his parents and throughout the game is unaware that Dracula is his grandfather.\n\nSimon's ''[[Castlevania Judgment]]'' incarnation (voiced by [[Keith Silverstein]]) was designed by ''[[Death Note]]'' artist [[Takeshi Obata]]. He has red-orange hair comparable to that of [[Light Yagami|Light Yagami]] (the protagonist of Death Note), a jacket with many belts on it that exposes his muscular chest, and bandages on his forearms. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=22836|title=Interview: Noisycroak On Traversing Castlevania's Musical Timeline}}</ref> Series director [[Koji Igarashi]] emphasized that these designs were different from what he envisioned, Simon in particular, but commented that this was how Obata envisioned them.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2008/07/why-a-wii-fight|title=Why a Fighting Game?

He is depicted as an arrogant and egotistical vampire hunter who competes with the main character Kevin Keene for the heroine Princess Lana, who he carries a torch for.  Simon has a whip and a backpack of resources which he uses throughout the series. His appearance in the cartoon was met with criticism. Ben Rhudy of Monsters and Critics stated that he looks nothing like his video game counterpart, and that the show's creator [[DiC]] should have consulted the game before choosing this design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/reviews/article_1262477.php/DVD_Review_Captain_N_The_Game_Master_-_The_Complete_Series |title=DVD Review: Captain N The Game Master \u2013 The Complete Series |publisher=Monsters and Critics |date=2007-02-12 |accessdate=2013-08-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211054536/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/reviews/article_1262477.php/DVD_Review_Captain_N_The_Game_Master_-_The_Complete_Series |archivedate=December 11, 2013 }}</ref> Simon also appears in several games outside the ''Castlevania'' franchise including the 2003 [[GameCube]] crossover [[fighting game]] ''[[DreamMix TV World Fighters]]'',<ref>{{cite web | author=Gantayat, Anoop | date=January 12, 2004 | title=''World Fighters'' | url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/01/12/world-fighters | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140405162602/https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/01/12/world-fighters | archive-date=April 5, 2014 | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=May 6, 2019}}</ref> the 2017 [[Nintendo Switch]] [[action game]] ''[[Super Bomberman R]]'',<ref>{{cite web | author=McWhertor | date=April 21, 2017 | title=Pyramid Head, Simon Belmont and Vic Viper coming to ''Bomberman'' for Switch | url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/21/15383898/super-bomberman-r-silent-hill-castlevania-gradius-characters-nintendo-switch-update | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424020854/http://www.polygon.com/2017/4/21/15383898/super-bomberman-r-silent-hill-castlevania-gradius-characters-nintendo-switch-update | archive-date=April 24, 2017 | publisher=[[Vox Media]] | work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | accessdate=May 6, 2019}}</ref> and the 2018 Nintendo Switch crossover fighting game ''[[Super Smash Bros.

She is a servant of Dracula. Her name is a reference to the title character of the 1872 novel ''[[Carmilla]]'', which predated Bram Stoker's ''[[Dracula]]'' by 25 years. Her first appearance was as an antagonist in ''[[Castlevania II: Simon's Quest]]''.<ref>Castlevania Judgement manual, pg 23</ref> She later reappeared in ''[[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood#Castlevania: Dracula X|Castlevania: Dracula X]]'', and ''[[Castlevania: Circle of the Moon]]'' (non-canon), and ''[[Castlevania Judgment]]''.  She is a devoted worshiper of chaos and [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]].\n\nIn 1830, she successfully resurrected Dracula in her [[Austria]]n castle, although he hadn't regained his full power.  To restore it, they planned to sacrifice the vampire hunter Morris Baldwin, father to Hugh Baldwin and mentor to Nathan Graves, during a [[lunar eclipse]] of the full moon.  As Nathan began making headway in the effort to rescue his master, Carmilla brainwashed Hugh to do her bidding and challenged Nathan to a battle in the Underground Waterway.  Although she died, Carmilla relished the fact that the rite to restore Dracula's power was nearly finished.\n\nCarmilla's appearances and names have differed. In ''Simon's Quest'', Carmilla was originally known as {{nihongo|Vampira|\u5973\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Jo Ky\u016bketsuki|lit. \"Female Vampire\"}} in the instruction manual, though the in-game hidden clue refers to her as Carmilla.  Her appearance was interpreted as a mask that leaked tears of blood. Until the release of ''Rondo of Blood'', Carmilla and her mask were available in the game as a [[boss (video games)|boss]]. This was the first time in the series she was referenced by the name.\n\nIn ''Rondo of Blood'', Carmilla has a blue-haired companion called {{nihongo|Laura|\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9|R\u014dra}}. Laura was the central protagonist and narrator from the original novel, ''Carmilla''. She is a particularly vicious non-boss enemy in ''Portrait of Ruin'', but is referred to as \"Carmilla's eternal servant\" in her bestiary entry. In the reboot ''Lords of Shadow'', Laura is Carmilla's daughter, who challenges the main character Gabriel with dangerous games. She appears in the 2018 crossover [[fighting game]] ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' as a stage character, based on her appearance in ''[[Castlevania II: Simon's Quest]]''.<ref name=\"SmashBros\"/>\n\nShe is voiced by [[Karen Strassman]] in ''Judgment''.\n\nIn the reboot of ''Lords of Shadow'', Carmilla is played by [[Sally Knyvette]]. She is one of the titular Lords, ruling over the vampires and is the second lord faced by the protagonist, Gabriel Belmont. She has a vampire \"daughter\" named Laura. Before sacrificing her soul to heaven, she was known to be a kind woman who loved all of Earth's creatures, and became the opposite as a Lord of Shadow. This is a marked departure from the description of her in life in the original novel. However, the explicit sexuality sometimes attributed to her (seen especially in Castlevania: Judgment) is a direct (albeit exaggerated) reference to her characterization in the novel. She appears again in the sequel, ''[[Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2]]'', albeit with a different appearance.\n\nShe appears in the ''Castlevania'' animated series, voiced by [[Jaime Murray]], having a distinct disloyalty to Dracula as she considered him a madman whose genocidal vendetta against the humans is threatening their race. She tricks Hector into helping in her attempt to take out Dracula, taking the human as her slave during the aftermath in the season two finale.\n\n===Ferryman===\nThe {{nihongo|'''Ferryman'''|\u6e21\u3057\u5b88|Watashimori}} is a character whose task is to carry people across dangerous rivers. He takes characters to \"meet their destiny\". He first appeared in ''Simon's Quest'' helping Simon reach Rover Mansion. He was later seen in ''[[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood|Rondo of Blood]]'' (and its remake, ''[[Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles|The Dracula X Chronicles]])'', ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night|Symphony of the Night]]'' and '' [[Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness|Legacy of Darkness]]''.\n\n==''The Adventure'' and ''Belmont's Revenge''==\n{{main|Castlevania: The Adventure|Castlevania II: Belmont's Revenge}}\n\n===Christopher Belmont===\n{{nihongo|'''Christopher Belmont'''|\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30fb\u30d9\u30eb\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9|Kurisutof\u0101 Berumondo|Christopher Belmondo}} starred in three ''Castlevania'' games as a protagonist, two for the Game Boy system and one for the Wii. The two Game Boy games were ''[[Castlevania: The Adventure]]'' and ''[[Castlevania II: Belmont's Revenge]]''. In the latter, Christopher has to rescue his son, Soleil Belmont, after he was kidnapped by Count Dracula. He appears in Nintendo Wii's ''[[Castlevania: The Adventure ReBirth]]''. He also was the protagonist in the limited ''Castlevania: The Belmont Legacy'' comic book series released by IDW Publishing. Christopher was a pre-existing character in the ''Castlevania'' universe even before the games he starred in were released, as he is mentioned by name in the Japanese manual for the first Famicom ''Castlevania'' title, as the last Belmont to have defeated Dracula, a hundred years before Simon.\n\n===Soleil Belmont===\n{{nihongo|'''Soleil Belmont'''|\u30bd\u30ec\u30a4\u30e6\u30fb\u30d9\u30eb\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9|Soreiyu Berumondo|Soleil Belmondo}} appears as a non-playable character in ''[[Castlevania II: Belmont's Revenge]]'', which was released for the [[Game Boy line|Game Boy]] in 1991.  He was called Soleiyu in the original release of ''Belmont's Revenge'' and was later correct to Soleil (French for sun) in the 1998 [[Konami GB Collection#Vol. 3|re-release]] of the game for the European market.\n\nIn 1591, Soleil, who recently celebrated his coming of age, was captured by [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]]'s minions and bewitched to do the Count's evil bidding. With the youth's help, Dracula was able to take human form once again. Christopher Belmont, his father, ultimately rescued him.\n\n==''Dracula's Curse'' and ''Curse of Darkness''==\n{{main|Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse|Castlevania: Curse of Darkness|Castlevania (TV series)}}\n\n===Trevor Belmont===\n'''Trevor Belmont''', known as {{nihongo|'''Ralph C. Belmondo'''|\u30e9\u30eb\u30d5\u30fbC\u30fb\u30d9\u30eb\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9|Rarufu Sh\u012b Berumondo}} in Japan, appears in ''[[Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse]]'', ''Castlevania: Judgment'', ''Akumajo Dracula Pachislot'', and is a supporting character in ''[[Castlevania: Curse of Darkness]].''\n\nTrevor defeated Dracula in ''Castlevania III''. This was accomplished with the aid of Grant Danasty, Sypha Belnades and [[Alucard (Castlevania)|Alucard]]. He would later marry Sypha Belnades and have children with her, adding the prodigious magical powers of the Belnades line to the Belmont line, which would be most prominently seen in [[List of Castlevania characters#Juste Belmont|Juste Belmont]].\n\nHe later plays a secondary role in ''Curse of Darkness'', where he is investigating the rise of Dracula in the region. He confronts the Devil Forgemaster Hector, and although he initially treats Hector with contempt, he aids him in his quest. After being injured by Isaac, Julia LaForeze gets to him in time, but he is unable to do anything for the remainder of the battle. Meanwhile, Hector succeeds in stopping Isaac and sending Dracula's castle back into the abyss, effectively lifting the curse placed three years prior. So, despite his nearly fatal defeat, Trevor's mission was accomplished. In the game, he is unlocked after beating the game with Hector.\n\nHe, along with Sypha Belnades and Grant Danasty, later makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]'' when zombies impersonate the trio to antagonize [[Alucard Tepes|Alucard]]. The same zombie impersonators also appear in ''[[Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin]]'' when [[List of Castlevania characters#Jonathan Morris|Jonathan Morris]] and Charlotte Aulin trek the Nest of Evil.\n\nBy Simon Belmont's era (as shown in ''Castlevania: Judgment''), Trevor Belmont is looked up to by his future descendants, along with his wife Sypha, his ally Alucard and his friend Grant, known as the \"Greatest Three\". This pushes Simon, who is trapped in the Time Rift, to seek them to prove his worthiness.\n\nIn the ''Lords of Shadow'' series, Trevor is the son of Gabriel Belmont. He makes his debut in ''Mirror of Fate'' where it is revealed that, under orders from Pan, who foresaw Gabriel's turn to darkness, Trevor's existence was kept secret from his father by the Brotherhood of Light, and he was not told of his parentage until adulthood. Shamed by his lineage, he ventured to Dracula's castle to defeat his father and avenge his mother, but falls to Dracula and is impaled by his own combat cross. The Mirror of Fate reveals the truth of his father's circumstances to Trevor, leading him to pity Dracula and reveal his identity as he dies. Horrified, Dracula attempts to revive Trevor by making him drink his blood, but seemingly fails. Never knowing Trevor's true name, Dracula buries him within his castle in a coffin bearing the name \"Alucard\". Trevor reawakens thirty years later as a vampire, taking the name engraved on the coffin. He returns in the sequel ''Lords of Shadow 2'' where he plays an important part in his father's journey of redemption.\n\nIn the animated adaptation, Trevor is the last of House Belmont; a noble house whose dedication in protecting the citizens of Wallachia led to the Church excommunicating them and evicting them from their ancestral lands (as they were accused of practicing black magic.) He first appears as a lazy drunkard, though eventually sobers to reveal his great skill in slaying monsters.\n\nTrevor is voiced by [[Richard Madden]] in ''Mirror of Fate'' and [[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]] in the [[Castlevania (TV series)|''Castlevania'' animated series]].\n\n===Grant Danasty===\n{{nihongo|'''Grant Danasty'''|\u30b0\u30e9\u30f3\u30c8\u30fb\u30c0\u30ca\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3|Guranto Danasuti}} is a character in ''Castlevania III'' and ''Castlevania: Judgment''. A young [[pirate]] (listed as an acrobat in the ending sequence of the ''Castlevania III'' Japanese version) and skilled knife fighter whose ship was corrupted by Dracula's magic, he was transformed into a demon and took over a clock tower in Wallachia. When defeated by Trevor Belmont, he became human again and decided to travel with Trevor to Dracula's castle. After Dracula's defeat, he oversaw the restoration of the lands that had been affected by Dracula's evil. In ''[[Castlevania Judgement]]'', it is revealed that he had loved Sypha and wanted to marry her. Because of this, he was jealous toward Trevor and chose not to go to their wedding. While rebuilding the nation, he ended up in a time rift and was challenged to fight several champions. He believed that the time rift would give him a chance to change history, allowing him to marry Sypha instead. But his encounters led to battle with both Sypha and Trevor. After defeating them, he learned to forgive his friend. After Grant was returned to his own time, he was later remembered not as the one who had helped defeat Dracula but as the man who had rebuilt Wallachia. Despite this, Simon Belmont is clearly shown to remember him as one of the \"Greatest Three\", forever linked to the Belmont Family as a dear friend of his ancestors and a strong warrior. His surname is likely a reference to the historical [[House of D\u0103ne\u015fti]], who were persecuted by the historical Vlad III. Dracula is very similar to Vlad the Impaler in game, and is said to have killed Grant\u2019s family. This mirrors the real life Vlad Dracula who killed the whole D\u0103ne\u015fti Clan, who were the cousins of the family Vlad\u2019s grandfather usurped.\n\nWhile he has yet to appear in the Animated Series, Grant is referenced in Season 3 by both Trevor Belmont and Saint Germain, said to have \"a Horse-Drawn Sail-Boat on wheels and called himself 'The Pirate of the Roads'\". Writer Warren Ellis has confirmed this to be a nod to the character.\n\n===Sypha Belnades===\n{{nihongo|'''Sypha Belnades'''|\u30b5\u30a4\u30d5\u30a1\u30fb\u30f4\u30a7\u30eb\u30ca\u30f3\u30c7\u30b9|Saifa Verunandesu}} appears in ''Castlevania III'' and ''Castlevania: Judgment''. A [[priest]]ess (although she introduces herself as a vampire hunter to Trevor in the ''Castlevania III'' Japanese version) and [[witch]] of the church who uses elemental magic in battle, Sypha hid her gender to become a vampire hunter. She fought for the church to destroy evil, though her sister witches were hunted down by the church. She went on a journey to confront and destroy Dracula. On her way to the battle, she ended up in the Time Rift and decided to take it upon herself to defeat those tainted by darkness, despite which side they were on. Upon the defeat of the Time Reaper, she was returned to her own era (Judgment). She continued her journey to destroy Dracula, but was defeated by his minion, the [[Cyclops]], and imprisoned in stone. She was freed when Trevor Belmont killed the Cyclops and aided Trevor in his battle against Dracula. After Dracula's death, she and Trevor married, adding her magical [[aptitude]] to the Belmont bloodline.\n\nIn the manual included with the Japanese ''Dracula's Curse'', it is stated that she lost her parents when she was young and was found wandering near a monastery in Wallachia. She was adopted by the monks there. Judgment elaborates that she belonged to a coven of witches who were executed as a result of Dracula's scheming. In the Judgment storyline, it is revealed that Grant actually carried a torch for her since their first meeting in Castlevania, but lacking the resolve to confess to her his feelings, he lets her slip into Trevor Belmont's arms. Despite this, Sypha is said to have missed her friend when he chose to refuse his invitation to her marriage, patching up their friendship only after Grant's return from the Rift. Despite this brief moment of confusion, Sypha, Grant and Trevor are known in Belmont history as ''The Greatest Three'', friends and warriors supreme, an example to all her descendants to follow.\n\nIn ''Lords of Shadow \u2013 Mirror of Fate'', Sypha Belmont, n\u00e9e Belnades, is the wife of Trevor and the mother of Simon. She tries to comfort Trevor when he learns of his parents' fate, and sees him off as he ventures forth to battle Dracula. Following Trevor's death, Dracula's forces are unleashed and she is attacked, telling Simon to escape as she is killed by one of Dracula's werewolves. Years later, her soul is found by Simon beneath Dracula's castle, though he is unaware of her identity, and she joins him to protect him on his quest.\n\nIn the animated adaptation, Sypha is a member of a group of nomad scholars known as the Speakers who are demonized by the Church as they are falsely accused causing the attacks conducted by Dracula's army. She seeks out the \"sleeping soldier\" that she hopes will stop Dracula's attack, only to be turned to stone by a cyclops before being saved by Trevor Belmont, who helps her find Alucard and release him from his prison. In the Belmont estate's repository of knowledge, she finds an incomplete spell meant to force Dracula's castle to appear in a given place and trap it there. Completing the spell, she successfully casts it, allowing the trio to confront Dracula. After Alucard drives a wooden stake through Dracula's heart and Trevor beheads him, Sypha burns what's left with her magic.\n\nShe is voiced by Charlotte Emerson in ''Lords of Shadow \u2013 Mirror of Fate'' and Alejandra Reynoso in the [[Castlevania (TV series)|''Castlevania'' animated series]].\n\n===Alucard===\n{{Main|Alucard (Castlevania)}}\n{{nihongo|'''Alucard'''|\u30a2\u30eb\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9|Aruk\u0101do}} is Dracula's only child, the half-vampire son of the count and a human woman named Lisa. He appears in Castlevania III, Aria of Sorrow, Dawn of Sorrow, Judgment & Legends, and stars in Symphony of the Night. He is voiced by [[Robert Belgrade]] (Symphony of the Night) and [[Yuri Lowenthal]] (all other roles). A reference to the 1940s movie \"Son of Dracula\", Alucard is \"Dracula\" spelled backwards. This is a title Alucard seems to have adopted for himself, as his actual full name is Adrian Fahrenheit \u0162epe\u015f.\n\nAlucard also appeared in ''[[Captain N: The Game Master]]'' voiced by [[Ian James Corlett]].\n\nAlucard appears in ''[[Mirror of Fate]]'', the second game in the ''[[Lords of Shadow]]'' reboot series. It is revealed that this version of Alucard was originally Trevor Belmont, the son of Gabriel and Marie Belmont, before being turned into a vampire. Trevor grew up not knowing of his true origin until the Brotherhood of Light reveals to him who his parents were. Believing that Dracula murdered his mother in cold blood, he decides to pursue him, in the hopes of destroying him and bringing peace. During the fight, Trevor is defeated and stabbed with his Combat Cross. Dying and gazing at the Mirror of Fate, he finally realizes the truth of what really happened to Gabriel and feels sorry for him, calling him his father. Dracula, feeling confused, gazes at the mirror as well and learns who Trevor was all along. Remorseful for killing his own son who had been unknown to him the entire time, Dracula tries to bring him back to life by making him drink his blood, which seems to be in vain. Dracula mourns over his loss, and places Trevor in a coffin with the name Alucard, since he never learned his son's real name. Many years later, Alucard awakens, with pale white skin, white hair, and glowing orange eyes. He meets up with Dracula and his own son, Simon. Alucard tries to finish what he started, angry that his father turned him into a vampire. Dracula asks Alucard to join him in remaking the world and destroying the Brotherhood, but Alucard refuses. Dracula proceeds to attack Simon for being a Belmont, wishing to end the Belmont bloodline due to his hatred of his past life. Alucard and Simon manage to defeat Dracula, and part ways as Dracula's castle crumbles.\n\nAlucard also appears as a supporting character in the sequel, ''[[Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2]]'', playing an important role in his father's journey of redemption. He is playable in the DLC ''Revelations'' taking place shortly prior to the events of the main game. In the ''Lords of Shadow'' series Alucard is voiced by ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' actor [[Richard Madden]].\n\nAlucard also appears in the [[Castlevania (TV series)|''Castlevania'' animated series]] voiced by [[James Callis]]. He opposes Dracula's mission to eradicate humanity, but loses their first confrontation, forcing him into slumber to heal his wounds. He is awakened by Trevor Belmont and Sypha Belnades, and after testing them in battle, joins them in a quest to stop Dracula.\n\n===Hector===\n{{nihongo|'''Hector'''|\u30d8\u30af\u30bf\u30fc|Hekut\u0101}} is the devil forgemaster and the main protagonist of ''Curse of Darkness''. He betrayed Dracula and left for a normal life. He took back his devil forgemaster powers to defeat Isaac and once again bring peace back to the land. The player controls Hector in the normal play mode. He has silver hair and wields a war hammer or sword.\n\nIn the ''Castlevania'' animated series (voiced by [[Theo James]]) Hector is portrayed as a forgemaster for Dracula's castle, creating monsters from dead corpses. As a child, he was beaten and isolated for his penchant of resurrecting dead animals as pets. After burning down his house (parents included), he worked to perfect his craft in Necromancy, leading to his eventual recruitment into Dracula's Castle.\n\n===Isaac===\n{{nihongo|'''Isaac'''|\u30a2\u30a4\u30b6\u30c3\u30af|Aizakku}} appears in Curse of Darkness and Akumajo Dracula Pachislot. He is Hector's villainous rival who stayed loyal to Dracula after Trevor defeated him a few years before the start of the game. The player will fight Isaac a few times over the course of the game.\n\nIn the ''Castlevania'' animated series, (voiced by [[Adetokumboh M'Cormack]]), Isaac is portrayed as a former African slave who was whipped regularly for small offenses. His suffering led to him developing a complete disdain for humanity, and soon kills his master. Working as one of Dracula's generals, his loyalty comes from Dracula treating him with far more respect than any other human.\n\n===Julia Laforeze===\n{{nihongo|'''Julia Laforeze'''|\u30b8\u30e5\u30ea\u30a2\u30fb\u30e9\u30d5\u30a9\u30ec\u30fc\u30bc|Juria Rafor\u0113ze}} is Isaac's sister and a [[Witchcraft|witch]]. She provides items for the player in a shop. Hector notes she bears a resemblance to Rosaly, his deceased lover.\n\n===Saint Germain===\n{{nihongo|'''Saint Germain'''|\u30b5\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30eb\u30de\u30f3|Sanjeruman}} appears in Curse of Darkness and Akumajo Dracula Pachislot. He is a person against Death. He can travel through time. He constantly asks Hector to abandon his quest, but never succeeds.  He does fight Hector at one point in the game. His name is likely a reference to [[Comte de Saint-Germain|the historical figure of the same name]].\n\nHe is voiced by [[Bill Nighy]] in the animated series.\n\n===Angela===\n'''Angela''' is a magical dancing girl from the Akumajo Dracula Pachislot games. She aids Ralph C. Belmont on his quest to stop Dracula, who has prematurely risen again. She casts a spell that annihilates a horde of skeletons and during Ralph's battle with Dracula, she is able to use magic to resuscitate him to continue the battle.\n\n===Lenore===\n\nLenore is one of the four members in the Council of Sisters in Netflix's animated series. She is in charge of watching over their slave Hector and convincing him to forge them an army. Going against Carmilla, Lenore then gives Hector clothes and moves him to a candle-lit cell with a desk and a blanket. Over time, Hector falls for Lenore's charms. She tricks Hector by slipping a magic ring onto his finger as they are having sex, which enslaves him. Lenore presents the council with rings she had forged to make Hector's night creatures loyal to them. The ring will also instantly kill Hector if he attempts to run away from them. She is voiced by [[Jessica Brown Findlay]].\n\n===Sumi and Taka===\n\nIn Netflix's animated series, Sumi and Taka are Japanese vampire hunters who travel to Transylvania to be trained by Alucard. They were once enslaved by a vampire named Ch\u014d, who actually enlisted into Dracula's army, but was killed by Alucard in the previous season finale. Alucard originally suspected they were thieves but began to bond with them, going as far as showing them the Belmont Hold. While he was in his bed one night, they entered his room and proceeded to have sex with him, but they then suddenly restrain Alucard by using a trap. Taka and Sumi accuse Alucard of witholding his knowledge of magic from them and not teaching them how to operate the castle. Before they can stake him, he uses his sword to slit their throats. Following their betrayal, Alucard is later seen prostate and weeping on the floor. The series ends with Alucard at the castle's entrance, where he has left the impaled bodies of Sumi and Taka as a warning to future visitors. Sumi is voiced by [[Rila Fukushima]] and Taka is voiced by Toru Uchikado.\n\n==''Kid Dracula''==\n{{main|Kid Dracula (1990 video game)}}\nKid Dracula is a lighthearted spinoff of the Castlevania series set sometime in the distant future. In Japan, the series is called ''Akumaj\u014d Dracula Special: Boku Dracula-kun''. Though elements from the series have been referenced throughout the main Castlevania series, the series has not been listed on any timeline published by Konami.\n\n===Kid Dracula===\n'''Kid Dracula''' is a 10,009 year old being and the lord of Castlevania. He had to retake the castle from Galamoth to return to his throne. In the Game Boy sequel, Kid Dracula defeated Galamoth a second time after the being attempted to capture the castle again. Throughout the series, Kid Dracula makes references to his \"father\", hinting at him to be an alternative version of Alucard.\n\nIn ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'', Kid Dracula's shadow can sometimes be seen in the background of the Dracula's Castle stage, and he can also be obtained as a collectible Spirit.\n\n===Galamoth===\n{{nihongo|'''Galamoth'''|\u5927\u9b54\u738b\u30ac\u30e9\u30e2\u30b9|Daima\u014d Garamosu}} (aka Garamoth) is the Lord of Space. He is originally from the Kid Dracula series. Sometime in the distant future, Galamoth tried to take over the Dracula's Castle to become the new Demonlord, but was defeated by Kid Dracula (Kid Dracula Famicom/Mobile phones). He tried to retake the castle again, but was defeated a second time (Kid Dracula GB). Galamoth later appeared as an optional boss in Symphony of the Night, located in the Floating Catacombs. Galamoth appeared in Aria of Sorrow as a soul that allowed Soma Cruz to see past areas blocked by time.\n\nHe is referred to by name in ''Castlevania Judgment'' when the Time Reaper is defeated. He is implied to be the one who sent the Time Reaper back 10,000 years into the past destroy Dracula and erase history.\n\n==''Rondo of Blood'' and ''Symphony of the Night''==\n{{main|Castlevania: Rondo of Blood|Castlevania: Symphony of the Night}}\n\n===Richter Belmont===\n[[File:richter-rondosotn.jpg|right|thumb|120px|Richter Belmont, as he appears in ''[[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood|Rondo of Blood]]'' (top) and ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night|Symphony of the Night]]'' (bottom).]]\n{{nihongo|'''Richter Belmont'''|\u30ea\u30d2\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30d9\u30eb\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9|Rihit\u0101 Berumondo|Richter Belmondo}} has starred as a protagonist in ''Castlevania: Rondo of Blood'' (and its remakes), ''Symphony of the Night'', and ''Akumaj\u014d Dracula: The Medal'' (an arcade medallion slot game). His first appearance is the main character in ''[[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood]]''.  In ''Symphony of the Night'', a direct sequel which takes place five years later, he became a brainwashed primary antagonist; however, completing the game unlocks an option to play the entire game as Richter. However, there is an alternate ending to ''Symphony of the Night'' that suggests that he was the cause of Dracula's return. He is also playable in an extra mode in ''[[Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin]]''.\n\nHero of the ''[[Castlevania: Dracula X]]'' games and a major character in ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]'', Richter had to battle legions of [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]]'s monsters to save his love interest Annette. In ''Symphony of the Night'', Richter mysteriously disappears upon investigating Dracula's recently reconstructed castle. It is later revealed that he was brainwashed by Shaft, a dark priest and servant of Dracula. Players will end up facing Richter: killing him will result in one of two bad endings, whereas saving him will continue the game.\n\nIn his first two appearances, as well as the prologue for the third, Richter wears a headband and a blue uniform. In ''Symphony of the Night'', only in the Saturn version following the prologue, his hair is noticeably longer and his attire appears more regal. He also gains a few new abilities, notably a dash, a slide attack, and a super jump that doubles as an uppercut.\n\nIn ''Portrait of Ruin'', Jonathan Morris fights a recreation of Richter (called \"Whip's Memory\") in a test created by Stella and Loretta Lecarde to unlock the Vampire Killer's full power, as he is the last known Belmont to wield the whip before [[List of characters in Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow and Dawn of Sorrow#Julius Belmont|Julius Belmont]] killed Dracula in 1999. Richter also appears in the game as one of the Five Greatest. Richter appears in the 2018 crossover [[fighting game]] ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' as a playable character alongside his ancestor Simon.<ref name=\"SmashBros\"/>\n\nRichter is voiced by [[David Vincent (voice actor)|David Vincent]] in the PSP remake of ''Rondo of Blood'', the PSP version of ''Symphony of the Night'', and ''Super Smash Bros. Ultimate''. His height is 5\u20194 in game, however in Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, he is 5\u20196.\n\n===Maria Renard===\n{{nihongo|'''Maria Renard'''|\u30de\u30ea\u30a2\uff65\u30e9\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c9|Maria R\u0101neddo}} is a local village girl with the power to control the [[Four Symbols (China)]] of [[Chinese mythology]]. She appears in the PC Engine video game ''Akumaj\u014d Dracula X: Rondo of Blood'' (and its remakes ''Dracula X Chronicles'' for PSP and ''Castlevania Dracula X'' for Super NES), as well as in ''Symphony of the Night'', ''Castlevania Judgment'', and ''Akumaj\u014d Dracula: The Medal''. She is a distant blood relative of the Belmont clan<ref>{{cite web |title=''Rondo of Blood'' manual |website=The CastleVania Dungeon |url=http://castlevaniadungeon.net/games/rondomanual.html |access-date=2006-08-15}}</ref><ref>Castlevania Judgement Manual, pg 21</ref> (no mention of that connection is to be found in ''[[Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles]]'', where she is instead said to be the daughter of a local lord). In the Super NES version of ''[[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood#Castlevania: Dracula X|Castlevania: Dracula X]]'', she's also said to be the sister of Richter's beloved Annette, a detail that's not alluded to in the other games. She was later adopted by the Belmont family in ''[[Castlevania Judgment]]''.\n\nIn 1792, Maria's parents were killed, and she was captured, along with several other young women, and taken to Dracula's castle. Richter Belmont saved Maria from Shaft, one of Dracula's servants, who was attempting to cast a spell on her. Once Maria is rescued, she becomes playable and uses various magically enhanced animal attacks for combat. There exists an ending in which Maria confronts and defeats the Count instead of Richter. In the introduction sequence to ''Symphony of the Night'' (a retelling of the final boss battle ''Rondo of Blood''), if Richter's health completely runs out, a 12-year-old Maria will appear and amplify Richter with her magic in his effort to defeat Dracula. ''Judgment'' further explains that she fought alongside Richter in defeating Dracula and has power that rivals the Belmonts. Unlike Annette, if you fail to save her in ''Rondo of Blood'', you will not face her at the end.\n\nFour years after the defeat of Dracula, Richter vanished. Maria immediately set out to find him. After a year of searching, in 1797, she finally found Castlevania. In the castle she learned that Richter was working in concert with the dark forces.  With Maria's help, the half-vampire [[Alucard (Castlevania)|Alucard]] was able to break Shaft's hold on Richter and defeat Dracula. Depending on certain player actions in Symphony, the player will receive different endings. In one, Maria will admit to not being able to live without Alucard and go after him. In another, she will resign herself due to the fact that she cannot ease his torment and returns home with Richter.\n\nMaria also appears in ''Judgment,'' with a more bratty personality. She constantly trips and miscalculates her powerful magics, for comedic effect, and she acts mostly unaware of the Time Rift's nature, for example believing that Simon and Trevor merely stole the Vampire Killer from her friend Richter. She is also seemingly obsessed with her young age and diminutive body, going so far to openly complain against Carmilla and Shanoa for their developed bodies, and claim that Sypha's large breasts are a \"gift from God\", lashing out to her for suggesting that her beauty may pose a liability in combat.\n\n===Shaft===\n{{nihongo|'''Shaft'''|\u30b7\u30e3\u30d5\u30c8|Shafuto}} is a dark priest that appears as antagonist in ''[[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood|Akumaj\u014d Dracula X Chi no Rondo]]'' and ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]''. In 1792, Shaft aids [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]] in his plans to kidnap several young women. He is defeated by Richter after conjuring several [[monsters]] in an attempt to defeat him. Later in the game, Shaft's ghost makes a final attempt to stop the hero.\n\nIn 1797, Dracula's monsters kidnap Richter and [[brainwashing|brainwash]] him. Shaft is instrumental in using his evil powers to control Richter, turning him against anyone who seeks to defy Dracula. Maria guesses that he is under their influence and helps Alucard to see past Shaft's deception. Alucard is able to save Richter instead of killing him, and goes on to defeat Shaft, although not before Shaft successfully revives Dracula just before being stopped for good.\n\n===Annette===\n{{nihongo|'''Annette'''|\u30a2\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8|Anetto}} is Richter's fianc\u00e9e.  In ''[[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood]]''\u2014and also ''Dracula X'' for the SNES and ''Dracula X Chronicles'' for the PSP\u2014she was kidnapped by Dracula's minions, along with Maria, Iris, and Terra. Failing to save her will result in having to face her as a possessed vampiress in ''Dracula X'' and ''The Dracula X Chronicles''. In the English localization of the SNES game ''[[Castlevania: Dracula X]]'', her name was spelled as \"'''Anett'''\" during the game's intro storyline. Depicted as a purple haired young girl in her original ''Rondo of Blood'' design, she was redesigned as a blonde in the same way as Maria, and wearing more aristocratic attire in ''Dracula X'' for the SNES and in ''Chronicles'' for the PSP.\n\n===Iris and Tera===\n{{nihongo|'''Tera'''|\u30c6\u30e9|Tera}} is the head nun of Richter's village, and {{nihongo|'''Iris'''|\u30a4\u30ea\u30b9|Irisu}} is the doctor's daughter. They were kidnapped by Dracula's minions to taunt Richter, along with Annette and Maria. Tera sees Richter as a warrior of God and Maria as angel sent by Heaven, thanking them both for saving her. Iris, being a doctor's daughter, helps heal the wounds of the duo when they rescue her as a show of thanks.\n\n===Lisa===\n{{nihongo|'''Lisa'''|\u30ea\u30b5|Risa}} is Alucard's mother and Dracula's second wife, seeing past her husband's personality to see the lonely man he truly is. She was executed on the charge of witchcraft after healing villagers with [[penicillin]], spurring Dracula's genocidal vendetta against humanity. Alucard witnessed her death and promised her not to hate humans and tells Dracula she will love him for eternity, which Alucard relays in ''Symphony of the Night''.\n\nIn the animated adaptation, her story remains the same with the exception that she was accused of witchcraft because she reverse engineered the more advanced technology Dracula possessed to improve the lives of the Wallachian people which the church condemned as the devil's work.\n\nShe is voiced by [[Emily Swallow]] in the [[Castlevania (TV series)|''Castlevania'' animated series]].\n\n===Golem===\n'''[[Golem]]''' is a recurring character found throughout the Castlevania series. His first appearance was in Rondo of Blood.<ref>Castlevania Judgement Manual, pg 24</ref> Golem was originally created by Carmilla to be a mindless guard of ancient ruins. When he was pulled into the time rift by Aeon, the rift gives him self-awareness. He fought the champions to become human, and discover the meaning of his existence. He lost his self-awareness, after being returned to his own time frame (Castlevania Judgment). IGA says he is based on Golem-type monsters, like the Franken, from Castlevania I.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cubed3.com/news/11037 |title=Interview: IGA-san Talks Castlevania Judgment on Nintendo Wii |author=Adam Riley |date=November 7, 2008 |work=Cubed3 |publisher= |access-date=October 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Master Librarian===\nThe {{nihongo|'''Master [[Librarian]]'''|\u56f3\u66f8\u9928\u306e\u4e3b|Toshokan no Aruji}} is the loyal servant of Dracula in charge of the knowledge of the library.

He is a descendant of the Belmont family, and wields the Vampire Killer whip, much like his ancestors. John died some time after the events of ''Bloodlines'', as it was revealed his wounds wouldn't heal. This was caused by his using the [[Vampire Killer whip]], which would sap the strength of someone that was not a full-blooded descendant of the Belmont lineage, but by the time John learned this, it was too late.\n\n''Bloodlines'' is deeply intertwined with the storyline of Bram Stoker's [[Dracula]].  As such, the father of John Morris is Quincy Morris, a character from the novel. It is only known that the Morrises are somehow of Belmont lineage. In the novel, Quincy stabs Dracula at the cost of his life, while Harker cuts off Dracula's head. However, that fact he managed to unknowingly deal a crippling blow to Dracula may have been the foundation for his part in the ''Castlevania'' version of these events.\n\n===Eric Lecarde===\n{{nihongo|'''Eric Lecarde'''|\u30a8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30ea\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9|Erikku Rik\u0101do}} appears in Bloodlines, Portrait of Ruin, and Judgment. Born on May 3, 1892 in Segovia, Spain, he uses the Alucard Spear (mistranslated as \"Alcarde Spear\" in ''Bloodlines''). The spear was created by Alucard to complement the power of the Vampire Killer, and fight alongside the Morris line. When Elizabeth Bartley attempted to revive Dracula, Eric volunteered to fight alongside his friend John Morris in the hunt. However, he had not told John the real reason behind his appetite for vengeance: the Countess turned the love of his life, Gwendolyn, into a vampire.\n\nYears later, Eric set out towards Dracula's Castle to investigate its reappearance, but was slain by the vampire Brauner. Unbeknownst to him, Eric's daughters had followed him into the castle and bore witness to his death, but both were then bitten by Brauner and turned into vampires. Unable to cross into the afterlife, Eric's ghost remained in the castle and was later met by Jonathan Morris and Charlotte Aulin. Initially calling himself \"Wind\", Eric tested the pair's abilities with various side-quests. After being confronted by Jonathan following a skirmish with Stella, in which a locket holding a photo of him and his daughters was recovered, Eric disclosed his true identity and the full story behind himself, his daughters, and Jonathan's father. Once his daughters are rescued and Brauner and Dracula are both destroyed, Eric appears before his friends and family and gives them one last heartfelt moment together before crossing over into the afterlife.\n\nIn ''Judgment'', Eric believed that the spear's potential was greater than the whip, and sought to prove that. While training he found himself in a time rift, having been brought there by Aeon. Eric believed the rift would give him a chance to prove the spear's potential against the Vampire Killer. After the defeat of Galamoth he was returned to his own time (Judgment).\n\n===Elizabeth Bartley===\nAccording to the game's story, {{nihongo|'''Elizabeth Bartley'''|\u30a8\u30ea\u30b6\u30d9\u30fc\u30c8\u30fb\u30d0\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc|Erisab\u0113to B\u0101tor\u012b}} is Dracula's niece, raised back from the dead by her servant {{nihongo|Drolta Tzuentes|\u30c9\u30ed\u30c6\u30a2\u30fb\u30c4\u30a7\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9|Dorotea Tsentesu}}. She triggered the start of [[World War I]] by assassinating the Crown Prince of Austria, then gathered the souls of those who died in the war to revive Dracula. In the final stage, she initially fights John and Eric in the form of a Medusa, then attacks with elemental spells before ultimately being killed.\n\nShe is based on the actual Countess [[Erzs\u00e9bet B\u00e1thory]], and was likely intended to ''be'' her, as B\u00e1thory's first name is commonly anglicized to \"Elizabeth\", and the name \"Bartley\" likely being a mistranslation.\n\n===Drolta Tzuentes===\n\n'''Drolta Tzuentes''' is a subservient witch of [[List of Castlevania characters#Elizabeth Bartley|Elizabeth Bartley]] (the American ''Castlevania: Bloodlines'' instruction book gives contradictory information, saying that she is an \"amateur witch\" who \"casts a spell which inadvertently brings Elizabeth Bartley back to life\"), who resurrects her master. Drolta then accompanies Elizabeth in their plot to resurrect Count Dracula.\n\nDrolta Tzuentes is based on Dorottya Szentes (Dorottya Semt\u00e9sz) who is one of the servants of [[Erzs\u00e9bet B\u00e1thory]] (the historical version of Elizabeth Bartley) who, along with 2 others, are said to have been tried, convicted, and executed as accomplices to the crimes down by the noblewoman.\n\n===Jonathan Morris===\n{{nihongo|'''Jonathan Morris'''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30ca\u30b5\u30f3\u30fb\u30e2\u30ea\u30b9|Jonasan Morisu}} is a member of the Morris family of vampire hunters and appears in ''[[Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin]]''. The wielder of the Vampire Killer in 1944, Jonathan received basic training from his father John Morris as a child. He tends to be a reckless youth, a trait which makes his childhood friend Charlotte Aulin worry about his well being much of the time. He can, however, be very observant. After his father died, Jonathan grew to resent him, though neither he nor Charlotte knew that the soul-sapping effects of a non-Belmont using the Vampire Killer in battle resulted in his death.\n\nAfter learning the truth about his father and the Vampire Killer from Eric, Jonathan gained a new found respect for his father. Jonathan may then choose whether or not to battle the whip's memory of Richter Belmont, the last Belmont to wield the whip, and successfully unleash the full power of the Vampire Killer, knowing full well that he may perish from using it, though it is up to the player to decide whether to engage this optional encounter, and the canonical choice is unknown. Regardless, Jonathan and Charlotte traveled to the top of Dracula's Castle, and battled the combined forces of Count Dracula and [[Death (Castlevania)|Death]], which had not previously occurred before according to Charlotte. When Dracula was vanquished, his castle was destroyed and Jonathan and the others escaped unscathed.\n\n===Charlotte Aulin===\n{{nihongo|'''Charlotte Aulin'''|\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30aa\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3|Sh\u0101rotto \u014crin}} is a magic user said to be descended from the Belnades clan. She shows strong potential as a sorceress. Along with Jonathan, she ventures into the castle to destroy Dracula. She is a smart girl who relies on enchanted books for information, to cast spells, and to summon weapons for close-range attacks. She also tends to be a nosy and talkative person, which is how she found out about Jonathan and the Vampire Killer, something which, according to Jonathan, she was supposed to keep secret. Charlotte is concerned about Jonathan's ability to wield the whip and assists him with the best she can, but she hates getting treated as (or even being called) a child. She tends to take things rationally and logically, which makes her seem unemotional but she is in fact a caring and compassionate young woman.\n\n===Brauner===\n{{nihongo|'''Brauner'''|\u30d6\u30ed\u30fc\u30cd\u30eb|Bur\u014dneru}} is a famous painter who forsook his humanity after losing his daughters during World War I. Now a vampire, he screams for vengeance upon humanity for their deaths.\n\nWhen Dracula's Castle first appeared, Brauner used his special paintings to keep Dracula sealed so that he could keep the dark lord's power all for himself. Eric Lecarde set off to investigate the castle, but was ambushed by Brauner and slain. At the same time, Eric's daughters Stella and Loretta arrived to bear witness to their father's death, and Brauner bit both girls so as to turn them into his new vampiric \"daughters\".\n\nWhen Jonathan and Charlotte finally confront Brauner, he flies into a rage over having lost his \"daughters\" again and attacks the pair. As he is defeated, Brauner explains the reasons for his actions, but is then slain by Death in order to revive Dracula.\n\n===Stella and Loretta===\n{{nihongo|'''Stella'''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30e9|Sutera}} and {{nihongo|'''Loretta'''|\u30ed\u30ec\u30c3\u30bf|Roretta}} are the daughters of Eric Lecarde, the older sister Stella being a master swordswoman with powerful wind-based attacks while Loretta wields powerful ice spells while serving as Stella's support. The vampire Brauner believe the two of them to be the reincarnations of his deceased daughters, having turned them to vampires and subjected them to a spell that causes their past lives to take control of them.\n\nBrauner's \"daughters\" initially prevent Jonathan and Charlotte from investigating the castle. After a short fight with Stella, the two learn of the sisters' true identities when they find a locket containing a picture with both girls and Eric Lecarde, prompting Eric's ghost to reveal what happened to his daughters. The four of them later confront each other in the highest areas of the castle. While it is possible to kill the sisters (triggering a bad ending), Jonathan and Charlotte must use the \"Sanctuary\" spell to restore Stella and Loretta to their true selves. Their minds and humanity restored, the sisters open a door that leads to Brauner's studio and also offer Jonathan a way to unlock the true power of the Vampire Killer.\n\nUpon defeating Dracula, Jonathan, Charlotte, Stella, and Loretta escape the castle, where Eric appears before them and tells his daughters to not burden themselves over their actions and move. Eric passes to the other side, leaving Stella and Loretta in tears, but they soon recover and thank Jonathan and Charlotte.\n\nStella and Loretta are playable in \"Sisters Mode\", which takes place before the main game and chronicles their search for their missing father. Unlike Jonathan and Charlotte, the player use the stylus to attack and the D-Pad to move them around, as they can also fly. As Stella, the player attacks enemies by slicing enemies with the stylus, and as Loretta, the player points at enemies to shoot a beam of ice.\n\n===Vincent Dorin===\n{{nihongo|'''Vincent Dorin'''|\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8\u30fb\u30c9\u30ea\u30f3|Vinsento Dorin}} is a [[priest]] that serves as the game merchant. Jonathan and Charlotte meet him in front of the castle and then near the entrance. Vincent is a rather greedy person, even if he explains that it is for the church. He also get bitten during the game and begs the two heroes to cure him (the player can choose to cure him or not, and while it affects the ending, it is not something noticeable). Even when cured, he isn't as much in debt concerning his merchandise.\n\nHis name was reused for an abbot in the reboot, ''Lords of Shadow''. He went insane by isolating himself and protecting a priceless artifact, while his townspeople were being slaughtered by supernatural creatures.\n\n==''Castlevania (Nintendo 64)'' and ''Legacy of Darkness''==\n{{main|Castlevania (Nintendo 64)|Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness}}\nIGA claimed in 2006 that ''Castlevania'' and ''Legacy of Darkness'' for the [[Nintendo 64]] were considered side projects to his timeline.<ref name=\"1up.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=4&cId=3152109 |title=Tales From The Crypt: Castlevania 20th Anniversary Blowout from |publisher=1UP.com |date=1997-10-31 |accessdate=2013-08-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215534/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=4&cId=3152109 |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}</ref> However, the games were later listed on the 20th Anniversary Timeline, without any description.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/puyo/314073086/in/set-72157594405290664/ |title=DSC01722 &#124; Flickr \u2013 Condivisione di foto! |publisher=Flickr.com |date=2006-12-04 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref> IGA later clarified that he looks at the titles as \"...a Castlevania \"gaiden\" (subseries)\" and complemented them by stating \"...they both have a really unique take on the Castlevania world.\"<ref>Nintendo Power, July 2008</ref>  Iga later included Cornell in Castlevania Judgment (Nov 2008) (drawn from his era of the timeline by magical forces<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coveritlive.com/index2.php?option=com_altcaster&task=viewaltcast&altcast_code=9cfac7534b&ipod=y |title=Viewer \u2013 Konami's E3 press conference |publisher=Coveritlive.com |date=2008-07-16 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref>). The game and manual makes references to Legacy of Darkness story.

Legacy of Darkness is said to be Cornell's previous appearance in the manual.<ref>\"Appearances: Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness\", Castlevania Judgment manual, pg 23</ref>\n\n===Reinhardt Schneider===\nThough the Belmont surname may no longer follow {{nihongo|'''Reinhardt Schneider'''|\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30cf\u30eb\u30c8\u30fb\u30b7\u30e5\u30ca\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc|Rainharuto Shunaid\u0101}}, the blood inside of his veins remains the same, and his destiny is no different. He is the son of Michael Gelhart Schneider. Villagers have been found mutilated and drained of blood near Dracula's castle, and Reinhardt has to stop it.  He carries the typical Vampire Killer whip but can also wield a shortsword for close-range combat for which the whip may prove unsuitable; although the surname \"Schneider\" usually carries the same connotation as does the English surname \"Tailor,\" its literal translation from German is the more general \"one who cuts.\"\n\nHe is voiced by Andrew Hanikson.\n\n===Carrie Fern\u00e1ndez===\n{{nihongo|'''Carrie Fern\u00e1ndez'''|\u30ad\u30e3\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30f4\u30a7\u30eb\u30ca\u30f3\u30c7\u30b9|Kyar\u012b Verunandesu}} is a magic-wielding girl descended from the Belnades clan. She was estranged from the populace of Wallachia for her affinity with magic, her mother dying to protect her from an angry mob. She turned her back on others, but when she learned that Dracula had once again risen, she took it upon herself to use her powers to stop him. She is Camilla Fern\u00e1ndez's cousin, who is also captured by a vampire and turned into one.\n\nShe is voiced by [[Bianca Allen]].\n\n===Actrise===\n{{nihongo|'''Actrise'''|\u30a2\u30af\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30bb|Akutor\u012bse}} is a Dracula's [[Witchcraft|witch]] servant, she sacrificed her own child to become immortal. She plays an antagonist role in Carrie's quest, offering her a chance to join Dracula, in which Carrie refuses. In the Castle Center, Actrise sics a Fern\u00e1ndez warrior, who became a vampire, on Carrie in an attempt to stop her from reaching Dracula. After Carrie defeats her cousin, she and Actrise do battle on top of one of the castle towers, in which Actrise is overwhelmed and killed by Carrie. She also appears in Cornell's quest and taunts him, and is revealed to be responsible for turning Henry's father into a vampire.\n\n===Rosa===\n{{nihongo|'''Rosa'''|\u30ed\u30fc\u30bc|R\u014dze|Rose}} is a woman who was recently turned into a [[vampire]]. She meets Reinhardt and Carrie in the Villa, watering flowers with blood. She plays a major role in Reinhardt's quest. She is seen next attempting to kill herself, walking into sunlight. Reinhardt stops her. She is then encountered with Death in the Castle Center in which she and Reinhardt do battle. She is defeated by him but is spared before Death takes her away. When Death ambushes Reinhardt, Rosa sacrifices herself by throwing herself into the path of Death's scythes. Rosa is comforted by Reinhardt as she dies, and then Death is defeated by a vengeful Reinhardt. In the end, after Dracula's defeat, Rosa is seen restored into human form and she and Reinhardt look upon Dracula's sunken castle.\n\n===Gilles de Rais===\n{{nihongo|'''Gilles de Rais'''|\u30b8\u30eb\u30fb\u30c9\u30ec|Jiru Dore}} is one of Dracula's servants. He used Cornell's power to reincarnate his master in the body of Malus. He later disguises himself as Dracula in preparation for his lord's eventual resurrection and kidnapped children to offer them as sacrifice and thus resurrect his master. He is later defeated by Reinhardt and Carrie in Dracula's throne room, where it is revealed he was an imposter.\n\n===Renon===\n{{nihongo|'''Renon'''|\u30ec\u30ce\u30f3|Renon}} is a demonic salesman who appears intermittently throughout the game. He claims that \"one needs gold even in Hell these days\", and will gladly sell the player various power-ups such as spells and potions. Renon can be summoned by picking up a contract scroll that appears in various levels. The scroll then turns into an open briefcase. If the player spends more than 30,000 gold pieces before encountering Dracula, Renon transforms into his demon form and attempts to claim your soul for Hell.\n\n===Charles Vincent===\n{{nihongo|'''Charles Vincent'''|\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30eb\u30ba\u30d3\u30f3\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8|Ch\u0101ruzu Vinsento}} is a vampire hunter. His mannerisms seem to indicate that he is very intelligent, but lacks real experience with vampires or other evils. Charles plays a key role in the game.\n\nIf the player takes less time in reaching the Castle Keep and defeats Dracula for the first time, he changes back into Malus, but Charles douses him with holy water, before Dracula warps the player to an alternate dimension for the final battle. After Dracula's defeat, Charles' fate is unknown.\n\nHowever, if the player takes more time in reaching the Castle Keep, Charles will arrive before them. He will fail in his attempt to subdue Dracula, and will be turned into a vampire instead. The player will be forced to fight and kill Charles. If this happens, then the heroes will not see through Dracula's illusions and ultimately fail in their quest.\n\n===Cornell===\n{{nihongo|'''Cornell'''|\u30b3\u30fc\u30cd\u30eb|K\u014dneru}}, also known as \"Blue Crescent Moon\", is a [[werewolf]] seen in both ''[[Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness]]'' and ''[[Castlevania Judgment]]''. He is a member of a warrior clan cursed to turn into beastmen. He is the only member of his clan who had the ability to control his change. He was the only one of his brethren who refused to join the forces of Dracula. He honed his skills in the hopes of finding a cure for his clan and to protect his sister Ada. One day while out training he found himself unable to control his powers and was stuck in beast form (''Castlevania Judgement''). He encountered Aeon, a time traveler, who told him he had entered a time rift. Aeon challenged him, and told him the time rift would let him learn more about the nature of the curse. After encountering several champions from different eras, he learns from Camilla and Death that they still need him, and is told that there is a possibility of a cure for him (though he doesn't trust them). After the defeat of the Time Reaper, Cornell was returned to his own era, 1844. He returned to find his village in flame, and his sister Ada kidnapped. He then journeyed after the kidnappers to save his sister. He discovered that Dracula's castle had risen again, and that his fellow man-beast Ortega had kidnapped his sister. During his battles he saves the young Henry Oldrey, and later defeats Ortega. He learned from Ortega, that Death, Gilles De Rais, and Actrise had plotted the kidnapping of Ada to empower a newly raised Dracula. Dracula later reveals to the audience that his sister is not a blood relative. Cornell fights Dracula to save her causing Dracula to be pulled into a vortex of energy. Dracula traps Cornell with his last power and tries to take Ada with him. The beast within Cornell freed itself from his body and saves Ada, but is captured and pulled into the vortex by Dracula. Cornell had become fully human, and was able to live the rest of a normal life with Ada (Legacy of Darkness).\n\nAccording to IGA, \"I believe many people did not expect to see Cornell.

The rivalry caused Ortega an increasing amount of frustration, as he was constantly being outdone on every occasion, and he started searching for a way to gain the kind of powers that would make him stronger than even Cornell.\n\nThis search led him on the path of darkness, as the only one able to grant him the request proved to be Dracula. As a condition for gaining the new powers, Dracula demanded of Ortega to aid his demons on their mission to kidnap Cornell's sister Ada and destroy the village. He was also to stop Cornell from rescuing Ada. Ortega accepted these conditions, and thus sealed his pact with the devil, gaining amazing power, but losing his humanity.\n\nOrtega eventually fights Cornell as a Chimera on top one of the castle towers, but is defeated by him. Ortega accepts his defeat, but with his powers becoming out of control, he leaps off the castle tower to his death.\n\n===Henry Oldrey===\n{{nihongo|'''Henry Oldrey'''|\u30d8\u30f3\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30aa\u30eb\u30c9\u30ec\u30fc|Henr\u012b Orudor\u0113}} is the son of Mary and J.

He is responsible for unwillingly triggering the events that take place in 1748, during ''Harmony of Dissonance'', by wishing to relieve Juste of his fate and become more powerful than he is. Inspired by the tale of Simon Belmont, Maxim gathered the cursed remains of Count Dracula so he could destroy them, and in doing so created an evil Maxim in his soul that hungered for power and destruction like Dracula did.\n\nIn the best ending, Juste helps Maxim overcome his dark influence by wearing their bracelets as a reminder of their friendship. Though not at full power, the evil Maxim takes Dracula's remains (gathered by Juste during his quest) and turns into a ghostly incarnation of Dracula (Dracula Wraith), then into a giant creature made of the body parts before finally being slain. Maxim is restored to normal afterwards.\n\nMaxim is playable in a secret gameplay mode of ''Harmony of Dissonance''. His Stellar Sword is also an obtainable weapon in ''Portrait of Ruin''.

He lost both parents at a very young age, and was knighted at the age of 16. When his love interest Sara Trantoul is kidnapped by the vampire [[Walter Bernhard]] he enters the castle grounds unarmed, but is given a whip that is blessed with the power of alchemy by the old man Rinaldo Gandolfi, who lives on the grounds. Rinaldo also enchants Leon's left gauntlet with the power to absorb magical attacks. Using the whip and his magic gauntlet, he enters the castle hoping to rescue his fianc\u00e9e.\n\nWithin the castle, Leon fights five guardians: Medusa, a Succubus, a Golem, the vampire [[Joachim Armster]] (Walter Bernhard's former ally), and an undead parasite. He gets a magical orb from each of them that unlocks the way to Walter's lair. When he gets past the initial barrier, Walter is there with Sara, who appears to be in some sort of trance. Walter returns Sara to Leon, who finds out that Sara has been tainted and will soon become a vampire. In an act of self-sacrifice, Sara offers her soul to Leon in a ritual that will make Rinaldo's magic whip deadly to vampires and thus allow Leon to defeat Walter. This is where the whip officially becomes \"Vampire Killer.\"  Leon, armed with the powerful whip, Rinaldo's grief, and his anger for Sara's death, defeats Walter. However, Walter's death was in actuality orchestrated by Leon's friend [[Mathias Cronqvist]] to get Walter's Soul, and absorb its powers to become a powerful vampire through the Crimson Stone, (an artifact that allowed a person to steal a Vampire's soul and make their power theirs, at the price of becoming a vampire themselves) and Vampire Killer can now sense his having abandoned Humanity. He offers Leon eternal life, which Leon refuses, saying that eternal life would be empty without Sara. Mathias then sends his servant Death after Leon, who is defeated by him and gives him a message to pass on to Mathias. Leon swears that his clan and the whip he now carries will destroy Mathias one day, and from that day onward the Belmont clan would hunt the night.

She is the most prodigious member of the Order of Ecclesia, a secret organization devoted to stop Dracula from reviving after the Belmont clan disappeared. She is also a glyph user, capable of absorbing sigil-like characters and using them as weapons. She is chosen by Barlowe to bear Dominus, a series of glyphs designed to destroy Dracula, but her fellow member Albus interferes during the ceremony and steals the glyphs. As a result, Shanoa becomes an amnesiac who is only able to simulate emotions (she cannot truly feel them).\n\nAfter being retrained by Barlowe, Shanoa is dispatched to seek out and retrieve Dominus from Albus by any means necessary. As she travels, she slowly learns Albus's true intentions and the dark reality behind Ecclesia, but she is unable to stop the return of Dracula.

Initially, Barlowe promised Albus that he would receive the Dominus seal, but changed his mind without his consent and chose Shanoa instead. After stealing Dominus from Ecclesia during the ceremony in which it was to be implanted within Shanoa, Albus flees with the glyph and becomes the enemy of Ecclesia. He spends much of the time researching the Dominus glyph and devising a way to incorporate it into himself. However, when he absorbs one part of the glyph (as he had given the other two away in order to observe how glyphs are absorbed) he is driven mad and Shanoa is forced to slay him.\n\nIf Shanoa kills Albus after rescuing all of the villagers, Albus will speak to her through Dominus and reveal his intentions in stealing the glyph. He had acted the way he did in order to protect Shanoa, who was raised as his younger sister, from the soul-stealing effects of the glyph, as channeling it would kill the user. He also has her promise not to use Dominus, as it would kill her. She also gains Albus' memories, some of which correlate with the ones she had lost. As it transpires, Albus's soul remains within Shanoa as she explores Dracula's castle, and he uses this opportunity to find a way to unlock her emotions, though her own memories are forever lost. When Shanoa uses Dominus to destroy Dracula, Albus offers his own soul as sacrifice, allowing Shanoa to live. Before his soul vanishes, Albus restores Shanoa's emotions and asks that she smile for him, which she manages through deep tears.\n\nHe is voiced by [[Keith Silverstein]].\n\n===Barlowe===\n{{nihongo|'''Barlowe'''|\u30d0\u30fc\u30ed\u30a6|B\u0101rou}} is Ecclesia's leader, who has been tasked with seeking a way to combat Dracula's power in the absence of the Belmont clan. To this end, he created the Dominus glyph out of Dracula's power and was in the process of giving them to Shanoa when Albus interfered and made off with the glyphs. When Shanoa returns after learning the truth about Dominus and the cost for its use, Barlowe reveals that he himself has been corrupted by Dracula's power, and that his goal all along was to have Shanoa sacrifice her soul to Dracula through Dominus so the evil count can return once more. After Shanoa critically wounds him in battle, Barlowe uses the last of his strength to bring Dracula to life again.\n\n===Villagers of Wygol===\nIn her travels, Shanoa encounters villagers from a location called Wygol, whom Albus captures and takes blood from in his studies on Dominus. After being rescued, the villagers will offer various side-quests for Shanoa to complete in exchange for money and special items. Shanoa must rescue all thirteen of the villagers in order to continue the storyline after defeating Albus.\n\nAfter Albus's death, the villagers are revealed to be indirect descendants of the Belmont clan, and their blood is what allows Albus's soul to live within Shanoa after he himself is killed.\n\n==''Judgment''==\n{{main|Castlevania Judgment}}\nAccording to Iga, \"So as many of you know, the Castlevania timeline goes over 1000 years\", \"And there is a character trying to destroy that timeline.

It is not known who his original parents were. Some suspect he was the unwanted child of a local wealthy landowner, most likely from the Cronqvist family, though this has never been proven. The Order named the boy after the blessed Archangel Gabriel and raised him as one of their own. The precocious child quickly proved to be extremely talented, developing a mastery of the fighting arts unprecedented in the Brotherhood. Gabriel took the surname of Belmont, due to his love for mountains and the high places of the world. The name Belmont is of French origin, and it means \"beautiful mountain\". The name is the union of two French words: ''bel'', meaning beautiful and ''mont'' meaning mountain.\n\nProne to dark moods and occasional ambivalence, Gabriel was deeply affected by the death of his childhood sweetheart, Marie.

Her spirit guides him on his quest to rid the land of evil.\n\nVoiced by [[Natascha McElhone]].\n\n===Pan===\n{{nihongo|'''[[Pan (god)|Pan]]'''|\u30d1\u30f3|Pan}} is the ancient Greek god of the old forest who may hold a clue to the circumstances surrounding the death of Gabriel's wife. Pan has contacted the Brotherhood of the Light to tell them that Marie Belmont calls from the other side and wishes to speak to her husband, so Gabriel searches for Pan's hidden grotto to seek the truth. During Gabriel's journey, Pan assumes several forms including a [[horse]], an [[eagle]], and an armor clad [[knight]].\n\nVoiced by Aleksander Mikic.\n\n===Claudia===\n{{nihongo|'''Claudia'''|\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2|Kur\u014ddia}} is a mysterious barefoot mute girl who has the ability to speak to Gabriel telepathically. when they first meet she keeps hiding and running away from Gabriel, but later wants to help him in his journey. after she decides to help, she requests that he find several crystals to fight against the supernatural creatures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/player/703749 |title=Castlevania: Lords of Shadow Video \u2013 Preview Walkthrough |publisher=GameTrailers |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref>\n\nShe is later known to be one of the last Aghartians, a now extinct race that created vast technologies ahead of its time; they were later wiped out after the lords of shadow took over the earth.\n\nShe is guarded by her Golem knight fabricated by her father shortly before his death, the golem lives on dead souls of supernatural creatures.\n\nVoiced by [[Emma Ferguson]].\n\n===Baba Yaga===\n{{nihongo|'''[[Baba Yaga]]'''|\u30d0\u30d0\u30fb\u30e4\u30fc\u30ac|Baba Y\u0101ga}} mysterious old [[hag]], who is later seen as a mystical [[Witchcraft|witch]]. She will help Gabriel, but wants a blue rose to make her young again for a temporary amount of time.\n\nShe is known to be wicked, but will help someone as long as they help her in return.\n\nVoiced by [[Eve Karpf]].\n\n===Satan===\n{{nihongo|'''[[Satan]]'''|\u30b5\u30bf\u30f3|Satan}} is the main antagonist of the series, and plotted all of the events of the first game. He is also the final boss.\n\nSatan's primary motivation seems to be to have his vengeance against God for being cast out of Heaven. He reveals himself as the manipulator of the first game's events in the end. After he is defeated by Gabriel Belmont, he drops the God Mask, which Gabriel uses to speak to his deceased wife for a short time. He reappears in ''Lords of Shadow 2'', where he serves as the main antagonist and final boss again. After his Acolytes manage to summon him to the mortal world, this time Satan chooses to possess Alucard, the son of Gabriel, who is now known as the powerful vampire Dracula. After his defeat, he flees from Alucard's body and is killed by Dracula, who uses his old Vampire Killer weapon to deliver the final blow.\n\nVoiced by [[Jason Isaacs]].\n\n===Victor Belmont===\nVictor Belmont is a descendant of Gabriel Belmont, although his exact relation is unknown. Victor claims to be the last of the Belmont lineage.\n\nVoiced by [[Anthony Howell (actor)|Anthony Howell]].\n\n===Toy Maker===\n\nAt a time, the Toy Maker was the brightest pupil of Rinaldo Gandolfi;  Though, he much preferred to build toys for children and the skill that gave him his name made him legendary across the lands.  However, hearing of his skill was Walter Bernhard, a member of the Bernhard family who offered the Toy Maker a place in his Castle to make his craft.\n\nIn time, the Toy Maker realized that Walter came from a family of dark occultists. Walter summoned a demon to possess the Toy Maker's kindly soul, thereby twisting his craft in the darkest way and making weapons of death and destruction, some being the Dark Pain, the Stopwatch, the Macabre Puppet, and Gargoyles.\n\nThe demon, however, was unable to completely corrupt the Toy Maker's soul, resulting in something of a split personality; the original kind old man and the childish, sadistic demon within. Sometime during this period, the Toy Maker was touched by the puppet of a child seeking to free his soul from the demon and escape Walter Bernhard. He then discovered he had regained his innocence and Walter removed his heart, putting the Toy Maker into a deep slumber.\n\nHis fate is unknown when Carmilla took over the castle, and only then until Gabriel Belmont, rechristened as Dracula, took over as well.\n\nVoiced by Mark Healy.\n\n===Agreus===\n\nAgreus is the brother of the deceased Pan, coming to Dracula's Castle to seek revenge against his killer, the vampire lord Dracula. First Agreus lures Dracula into the Castle's gardens with a fragment of the Mirror of Fate knowing that he would seek the fragment for his son Trevor Belmont. As Dracula attempts to claim the fragment, Agreus steals it from him and informs the vampire that he intends to avenge Pan's death. Dracula tries to reason with Agreus that his brother chose to sacrifice himself for a cause that he believed in, but Agreus retorts that Pan only died to serve his quest for power. Declaring that Dracula would pay for what he had done, Agreus retreats into the maze, goading the vampire to follow him.\n\nNow trapped inside the maze with the vengeful God, Dracula is forced to evade him in order to escape. Agreus taunts the vampire, claiming that he would relish hunting him down but Dracula manages to avoid him long enough to reclaim the fragment from his Owl Familiar. Enraged, Agreus vows to destroy Dracula and challenges him to a final battle. Eventually the two warriors tumble off the edge of the cliff but Dracula uses Agreus to break his fall. With the Old God weakened and unable to fight back, Dracula proceeds to crush Agreus' skull, killing him.\n\nVoiced by Aleksander Mikic.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Castlevania series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Characters In The Castlevania Series}}\n[[Category:Castlevania characters| ]]\n[[Category:Lists of Konami characters|Castlevania]]\n[[Category:Fictional vampire hunters]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Castlevania'' characters}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=July 2008}}\n{{overly detailed|date=February 2010}}\n}}\nListed below are characters from all of the ''[[Castlevania]]'' video games in the order of their introduction and the game's release.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==''Castlevania'' and ''Simon's Quest''==\n{{Main|Castlevania (1986 video game)|Castlevania II: Simon's Quest}}\n\n===Dracula===\n{{Main|Dracula (Castlevania)}}\nThe main antagonist of the ''Castlevania'' series is {{nihongo|'''Dracula'''|\u30c9\u30e9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e9|Dorakyura}}, based on the [[Count Dracula|original character]] by [[Bram Stoker]] and his depictions in film.<ref name=\"DenOfGeek\">{{cite web |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/games/castlevania/258652/castlevania-a-dracula-masterpiece-90-years-in-the-making |title=Castlevania: A Dracula Masterpiece 90 Years in the Making |work=Den of Geek! |accessdate=September 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180926200259/http://www.denofgeek.com/us/games/castlevania/258652/castlevania-a-dracula-masterpiece-90-years-in-the-making |archive-date=2018-09-26 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"CVStory\">{{cite web | title=Castlevania Storyline | url=http://castlevaniadungeon.net/storyline.html | work=The Castlevania Dungeon | accessdate=2007-08-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718050007/http://www.castlevaniadungeon.net/storyline.html | archive-date=2009-07-18 | url-status=live }}</ref> His real name is Dracula Vlad Tepes, and is extimated to be over 800-years old by ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]'' (1997).<ref name=\"SOTNManualCast\"/> With a few exceptions, he has starred in every title.<ref name=\"CVStory\"/> The series mainly takes place in the eponymous castle of Count Dracula,<ref name=\"DenOfGeek\"/> who resurrects every hundred years to take over the world.<ref>{{cite book| title=Castlevania Chronicles instruction manual| year=2001| publisher=Konami| id=SLUS-01384 | pages=4\u20135}}</ref> Players often assume the role of the Belmonts, a family of vampire hunters who have defeated Dracula for centuries with the Vampire Killer, a legendary whip.<ref name=\"IGNHistory\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/en/feature/21098/ign-presents-the-history-of-castlevania/4 |title=IGN Presents the History of Castlevania |last=Ciolek |first=Todd |date=February 25, 2014 |website=[[IGN]] |access-date=March 6, 2014}}</ref> \n\nFirst seen in ''[[Castlevania (1986 video game)|Castlevania]]'' (1986), Dracula is a vampire who was once defeated by Christopher Belmont a hundred years ago in [[Transylvania]].<ref name=\"Akumajo1Manual\">{{cite book| title=Akumaj\u014d Dracula instruction manual| year=1986| publisher=Konami| language=Japanese| id=KDS-AKM | pages=5\u20138}}</ref> He rises from the dead after his followers hold a black mass.<ref name=\"Akumajo1Manual\"/> Christopher's descendant, Simon Belmont, enters Dracula's castle<ref name=\"Akumajo1Manual\"/> and defeats him.<ref name=\"NP250\"/> Later titles introduce Dracula's  son, the [[dhampir]] Alucard, who sided with Trevor Belmont against his father.<ref name=\"GameSpotCastlevaniaHistoryP5\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/history_castlevania/p5_01.html |title=The History of Castlevania \u2013 Page 5 |website=[[GameSpot]] |author=Whalen, Mike |author2=Varanici, Giancarlo |date=September 10, 1998 |accessdate=February 16, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705064549/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/history_castlevania/p5_01.html |archivedate=July 5, 2008 }}</ref> In ''Symphony of the Night'', Alucard's mother was revealed to be Lisa, a human Dracula fell in love with.<ref name=\"SOTNManualCast\">{{cite book| title=Castlevania: Symphony of the Night instruction manual| year=1997| publisher=Konami| language=English| id=SLUS-00067 | pages=9-12}}</ref> Her execution for false charges of witchcraft left him griefstricken.<ref name=\"SOTNManualCast\"/>\n\nThe 2010 reboot, ''[[Castlevania: Lords of Shadow]]'', reintroduces Dracula as Gabriel Belmont.

Death is often a boss fought toward the end of the game. He is considered Dracula's second-in-command and most trusted minion. Sometimes he has played an important role to the storyline, such as ''[[Castlevania: Lament of Innocence]]''. He is a playable character as the skeletal knight in ''[[Castlevania Judgment]]''.\n\nIn most of his appearances, Death closely resembles the cultural personification of the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]], being a legless skeleton in a hooded cloak with a [[scythe]]. Like Dracula, but in a lot fewer games, he can change into a second form upon being defeated in the game.\n\nHe is voiced by Dennis Falt in ''Symphony of the Night'', Patrick Seitz in ''The Dracula X Chronicles'' and ''Order of Ecclesia'', [[Douglas Rye]] in ''Judgment'' and [[Tom Wyner]] in earlier games. Death also appears in the 2018 crossover [[fighting game]] ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' as a stage character.<ref name=\"SmashBros\"/>\n\nThe character of Zobek, Lord of the Dead (voiced by [[Patrick Stewart]]) in the reboot ''Castlevania: Lords of Shadow'' has been speculated to be the version of Death of this universe, due to his relationship with Dracula. Additionally, the Lord of the Necromancers is at one point referred to as \"Death itself\". In the game's [[Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2|sequel]], when Gabriel Belmont is forced into a confrontation with Zobek sheds his human form and takes on a more traditionalized appearance of Death (including wielding a large scythe).\n\n===Simon Belmont===\n[[File:CVGoS Simon Belmont.png|thumb|right|Simon Belmont is the first protagonist to appear in the ''Castlevania'' series.]]\n{{nihongo|'''Simon Belmont'''|\u30b7\u30e2\u30f3\u30fb\u30d9\u30eb\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9|Shimon Berumondo|Simon Belmondo}} is the first protagonist to appear in the series. He has appeared in ''[[Castlevania (1986 video game)|Castlevania]]'', ''[[Vampire Killer]]'', ''[[Haunted Castle (video game)|Haunted Castle]]'', ''[[Castlevania II: Simon's Quest]]'', ''[[Super Castlevania IV]]'', ''[[Castlevania Chronicles]]'', ''[[Castlevania Judgment]]'', and ''[[Castlevania: Harmony of Despair]]''.\n\nSimon initially kills Dracula in the year 1691, an event that is told in multiple games (''[[Castlevania (1986 video game)|Castlevania]]'', ''[[Vampire Killer]]'', ''[[Haunted Castle (video game)|Haunted Castle]]'', ''[[Super Castlevania IV]]'', and ''[[Castlevania Chronicles]]''). In ''Castlevania II: Simon's Quest'', it is revealed that Dracula placed a curse on Simon and all of Transylvania after he was defeated by him. To break the curse, Simon must gather the remains of Dracula in order to burn them at the ruins of Dracula's castle &ndash; though the fact that this will cause Dracula to return is unknown to Simon (Dracula's Fang). In the best and canonical ending, Simon breaks the curse, and Transylvania recognizes his bravery, though it is hinted that Dracula will inevitably return, as his skinless hand rises from his grave. Simon is one of only two Belmonts to have faced Dracula twice in his lifetime, the other being his ancestor Christopher. \n\nIn ''[[Haunted Castle (video game)|Haunted Castle]]'', Simon is blue-haired and has a wife called Selena, who is kidnapped by Dracula directly after their marriage. It is actually unknown if this is Simon at all. The guide to the game calls him Simons, a descendant of the canonical  Simon, while a newsletter by Konami itself names him William. <ref>{{cite video|title=Game Simulation Video series: Akumaj\u014d Dracula (arcade version)|language=Japanese|url=http://castlevaniadungeon.net/Images/Scans/HC/hctape.jpg}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Simon is the first Belmont to appear in a Castlevania game, in the Belmont lineage, [[Leon Belmont]] originates the direct bloodline of the clan. It can then be presumed that he is followed by Trevor, Christopher, Soleil, Simon, Juste, Richter, and then Julius. In ''[[Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance]]'', Simon is playable in the Boss Rush mode, looking exactly as he did in ''[[Castlevania (1986 video game)|Castlevania]]''. In ''[[Castlevania: Harmony of Despair]]'', Simon is an extra character purchased as downloadable content, the sprite from the original game also being reused here. A special stage that recreates the game's castle layout can also be purchased.\n\nSimon Belmont appears in the rebooted series ''[[Castlevania: Lords of Shadow \u2013 Mirror of Fate]]'' (voiced by [[Alec Newman]]), as the son of Trevor Belmont, and grandson of Gabriel Belmont, later known as Dracula. He seeks revenge for the murder of his parents and throughout the game is unaware that Dracula is his grandfather.\n\nSimon's ''[[Castlevania Judgment]]'' incarnation (voiced by [[Keith Silverstein]]) was designed by ''[[Death Note]]'' artist [[Takeshi Obata]]. He has red-orange hair comparable to that of [[Light Yagami|Light Yagami]] (the protagonist of Death Note), a jacket with many belts on it that exposes his muscular chest, and bandages on his forearms. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=22836|title=Interview: Noisycroak On Traversing Castlevania's Musical Timeline}}</ref> Series director [[Koji Igarashi]] emphasized that these designs were different from what he envisioned, Simon in particular, but commented that this was how Obata envisioned them.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2008/07/why-a-wii-fight|title=Why a Fighting Game?

He is depicted as an arrogant and egotistical vampire hunter who competes with the main character Kevin Keene for the heroine Princess Lana, who he carries a torch for.  Simon has a whip and a backpack of resources which he uses throughout the series. His appearance in the cartoon was met with criticism. Ben Rhudy of Monsters and Critics stated that he looks nothing like his video game counterpart, and that the show's creator [[DiC]] should have consulted the game before choosing this design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/reviews/article_1262477.php/DVD_Review_Captain_N_The_Game_Master_-_The_Complete_Series |title=DVD Review: Captain N The Game Master \u2013 The Complete Series |publisher=Monsters and Critics |date=2007-02-12 |accessdate=2013-08-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211054536/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/reviews/article_1262477.php/DVD_Review_Captain_N_The_Game_Master_-_The_Complete_Series |archivedate=December 11, 2013 }}</ref> Simon also appears in several games outside the ''Castlevania'' franchise including the 2003 [[GameCube]] crossover [[fighting game]] ''[[DreamMix TV World Fighters]]'',<ref>{{cite web | author=Gantayat, Anoop | date=January 12, 2004 | title=''World Fighters'' | url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/01/12/world-fighters | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140405162602/https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/01/12/world-fighters | archive-date=April 5, 2014 | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=May 6, 2019}}</ref> the 2017 [[Nintendo Switch]] [[action game]] ''[[Super Bomberman R]]'',<ref>{{cite web | author=McWhertor | date=April 21, 2017 | title=Pyramid Head, Simon Belmont and Vic Viper coming to ''Bomberman'' for Switch | url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/21/15383898/super-bomberman-r-silent-hill-castlevania-gradius-characters-nintendo-switch-update | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424020854/http://www.polygon.com/2017/4/21/15383898/super-bomberman-r-silent-hill-castlevania-gradius-characters-nintendo-switch-update | archive-date=April 24, 2017 | publisher=[[Vox Media]] | work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | accessdate=May 6, 2019}}</ref> and the 2018 Nintendo Switch crossover fighting game ''[[Super Smash Bros.

She is a servant of Dracula. Her name is a reference to the title character of the 1872 novel ''[[Carmilla]]'', which predated Bram Stoker's ''[[Dracula]]'' by 25 years. Her first appearance was as an antagonist in ''[[Castlevania II: Simon's Quest]]''.<ref>Castlevania Judgement manual, pg 23</ref> She later reappeared in ''[[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood#Castlevania: Dracula X|Castlevania: Dracula X]]'', and ''[[Castlevania: Circle of the Moon]]'' (non-canon), and ''[[Castlevania Judgment]]''.  She is a devoted worshiper of chaos and [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]].\n\nIn 1830, she successfully resurrected Dracula in her [[Austria]]n castle, although he hadn't regained his full power.  To restore it, they planned to sacrifice the vampire hunter Morris Baldwin, father to Hugh Baldwin and mentor to Nathan Graves, during a [[lunar eclipse]] of the full moon.  As Nathan began making headway in the effort to rescue his master, Carmilla brainwashed Hugh to do her bidding and challenged Nathan to a battle in the Underground Waterway.  Although she died, Carmilla relished the fact that the rite to restore Dracula's power was nearly finished.\n\nCarmilla's appearances and names have differed. In ''Simon's Quest'', Carmilla was originally known as {{nihongo|Vampira|\u5973\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Jo Ky\u016bketsuki|lit. \"Female Vampire\"}} in the instruction manual, though the in-game hidden clue refers to her as Carmilla.  Her appearance was interpreted as a mask that leaked tears of blood. Until the release of ''Rondo of Blood'', Carmilla and her mask were available in the game as a [[boss (video games)|boss]]. This was the first time in the series she was referenced by the name.\n\nIn ''Rondo of Blood'', Carmilla has a blue-haired companion called {{nihongo|Laura|\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9|R\u014dra}}. Laura was the central protagonist and narrator from the original novel, ''Carmilla''. She is a particularly vicious non-boss enemy in ''Portrait of Ruin'', but is referred to as \"Carmilla's eternal servant\" in her bestiary entry. In the reboot ''Lords of Shadow'', Laura is Carmilla's daughter, who challenges the main character Gabriel with dangerous games. She appears in the 2018 crossover [[fighting game]] ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' as a stage character, based on her appearance in ''[[Castlevania II: Simon's Quest]]''.<ref name=\"SmashBros\"/>\n\nShe is voiced by [[Karen Strassman]] in ''Judgment''.\n\nIn the reboot of ''Lords of Shadow'', Carmilla is played by [[Sally Knyvette]]. She is one of the titular Lords, ruling over the vampires and is the second lord faced by the protagonist, Gabriel Belmont. She has a vampire \"daughter\" named Laura. Before sacrificing her soul to heaven, she was known to be a kind woman who loved all of Earth's creatures, and became the opposite as a Lord of Shadow. This is a marked departure from the description of her in life in the original novel. However, the explicit sexuality sometimes attributed to her (seen especially in Castlevania: Judgment) is a direct (albeit exaggerated) reference to her characterization in the novel. She appears again in the sequel, ''[[Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2]]'', albeit with a different appearance.\n\nShe appears in the ''Castlevania'' animated series, voiced by [[Jaime Murray]], having a distinct disloyalty to Dracula as she considered him a madman whose genocidal vendetta against the humans is threatening their race. She tricks Hector into helping in her attempt to take out Dracula, taking the human as her slave during the aftermath in the season two finale.\n\n===Ferryman===\nThe {{nihongo|'''Ferryman'''|\u6e21\u3057\u5b88|Watashimori}} is a character whose task is to carry people across dangerous rivers. He takes characters to \"meet their destiny\". He first appeared in ''Simon's Quest'' helping Simon reach Rover Mansion. He was later seen in ''[[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood|Rondo of Blood]]'' (and its remake, ''[[Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles|The Dracula X Chronicles]])'', ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night|Symphony of the Night]]'' and '' [[Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness|Legacy of Darkness]]''.\n\n==''The Adventure'' and ''Belmont's Revenge''==\n{{main|Castlevania: The Adventure|Castlevania II: Belmont's Revenge}}\n\n===Christopher Belmont===\n{{nihongo|'''Christopher Belmont'''|\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30fb\u30d9\u30eb\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9|Kurisutof\u0101 Berumondo|Christopher Belmondo}} starred in three ''Castlevania'' games as a protagonist, two for the Game Boy system and one for the Wii. The two Game Boy games were ''[[Castlevania: The Adventure]]'' and ''[[Castlevania II: Belmont's Revenge]]''. In the latter, Christopher has to rescue his son, Soleil Belmont, after he was kidnapped by Count Dracula. He appears in Nintendo Wii's ''[[Castlevania: The Adventure ReBirth]]''. He also was the protagonist in the limited ''Castlevania: The Belmont Legacy'' comic book series released by IDW Publishing. Christopher was a pre-existing character in the ''Castlevania'' universe even before the games he starred in were released, as he is mentioned by name in the Japanese manual for the first Famicom ''Castlevania'' title, as the last Belmont to have defeated Dracula, a hundred years before Simon.\n\n===Soleil Belmont===\n{{nihongo|'''Soleil Belmont'''|\u30bd\u30ec\u30a4\u30e6\u30fb\u30d9\u30eb\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9|Soreiyu Berumondo|Soleil Belmondo}} appears as a non-playable character in ''[[Castlevania II: Belmont's Revenge]]'', which was released for the [[Game Boy line|Game Boy]] in 1991.  He was called Soleiyu in the original release of ''Belmont's Revenge'' and was later correct to Soleil (French for sun) in the 1998 [[Konami GB Collection#Vol. 3|re-release]] of the game for the European market.\n\nIn 1591, Soleil, who recently celebrated his coming of age, was captured by [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]]'s minions and bewitched to do the Count's evil bidding. With the youth's help, Dracula was able to take human form once again. Christopher Belmont, his father, ultimately rescued him.\n\n==''Dracula's Curse'' and ''Curse of Darkness''==\n{{main|Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse|Castlevania: Curse of Darkness|Castlevania (TV series)}}\n\n===Trevor Belmont===\n'''Trevor Belmont''', known as {{nihongo|'''Ralph C. Belmondo'''|\u30e9\u30eb\u30d5\u30fbC\u30fb\u30d9\u30eb\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9|Rarufu Sh\u012b Berumondo}} in Japan, appears in ''[[Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse]]'', ''Castlevania: Judgment'', ''Akumajo Dracula Pachislot'', and is a supporting character in ''[[Castlevania: Curse of Darkness]].''\n\nTrevor defeated Dracula in ''Castlevania III''. This was accomplished with the aid of Grant Danasty, Sypha Belnades and [[Alucard (Castlevania)|Alucard]]. He would later marry Sypha Belnades and have children with her, adding the prodigious magical powers of the Belnades line to the Belmont line, which would be most prominently seen in [[List of Castlevania characters#Juste Belmont|Juste Belmont]].\n\nHe later plays a secondary role in ''Curse of Darkness'', where he is investigating the rise of Dracula in the region. He confronts the Devil Forgemaster Hector, and although he initially treats Hector with contempt, he aids him in his quest. After being injured by Isaac, Julia LaForeze gets to him in time, but he is unable to do anything for the remainder of the battle. Meanwhile, Hector succeeds in stopping Isaac and sending Dracula's castle back into the abyss, effectively lifting the curse placed three years prior. So, despite his nearly fatal defeat, Trevor's mission was accomplished. In the game, he is unlocked after beating the game with Hector.\n\nHe, along with Sypha Belnades and Grant Danasty, later makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]'' when zombies impersonate the trio to antagonize [[Alucard Tepes|Alucard]]. The same zombie impersonators also appear in ''[[Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin]]'' when [[List of Castlevania characters#Jonathan Morris|Jonathan Morris]] and Charlotte Aulin trek the Nest of Evil.\n\nBy Simon Belmont's era (as shown in ''Castlevania: Judgment''), Trevor Belmont is looked up to by his future descendants, along with his wife Sypha, his ally Alucard and his friend Grant, known as the \"Greatest Three\". This pushes Simon, who is trapped in the Time Rift, to seek them to prove his worthiness.\n\nIn the ''Lords of Shadow'' series, Trevor is the son of Gabriel Belmont. He makes his debut in ''Mirror of Fate'' where it is revealed that, under orders from Pan, who foresaw Gabriel's turn to darkness, Trevor's existence was kept secret from his father by the Brotherhood of Light, and he was not told of his parentage until adulthood. Shamed by his lineage, he ventured to Dracula's castle to defeat his father and avenge his mother, but falls to Dracula and is impaled by his own combat cross. The Mirror of Fate reveals the truth of his father's circumstances to Trevor, leading him to pity Dracula and reveal his identity as he dies. Horrified, Dracula attempts to revive Trevor by making him drink his blood, but seemingly fails. Never knowing Trevor's true name, Dracula buries him within his castle in a coffin bearing the name \"Alucard\". Trevor reawakens thirty years later as a vampire, taking the name engraved on the coffin. He returns in the sequel ''Lords of Shadow 2'' where he plays an important part in his father's journey of redemption.\n\nIn the animated adaptation, Trevor is the last of House Belmont; a noble house whose dedication in protecting the citizens of Wallachia led to the Church excommunicating them and evicting them from their ancestral lands (as they were accused of practicing black magic.) He first appears as a lazy drunkard, though eventually sobers to reveal his great skill in slaying monsters.\n\nTrevor is voiced by [[Richard Madden]] in ''Mirror of Fate'' and [[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]] in the [[Castlevania (TV series)|''Castlevania'' animated series]].\n\n===Grant Danasty===\n{{nihongo|'''Grant Danasty'''|\u30b0\u30e9\u30f3\u30c8\u30fb\u30c0\u30ca\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3|Guranto Danasuti}} is a character in ''Castlevania III'' and ''Castlevania: Judgment''. A young [[pirate]] (listed as an acrobat in the ending sequence of the ''Castlevania III'' Japanese version) and skilled knife fighter whose ship was corrupted by Dracula's magic, he was transformed into a demon and took over a clock tower in Wallachia. When defeated by Trevor Belmont, he became human again and decided to travel with Trevor to Dracula's castle. After Dracula's defeat, he oversaw the restoration of the lands that had been affected by Dracula's evil. In ''[[Castlevania Judgement]]'', it is revealed that he had loved Sypha and wanted to marry her. Because of this, he was jealous toward Trevor and chose not to go to their wedding. While rebuilding the nation, he ended up in a time rift and was challenged to fight several champions. He believed that the time rift would give him a chance to change history, allowing him to marry Sypha instead. But his encounters led to battle with both Sypha and Trevor. After defeating them, he learned to forgive his friend. After Grant was returned to his own time, he was later remembered not as the one who had helped defeat Dracula but as the man who had rebuilt Wallachia. Despite this, Simon Belmont is clearly shown to remember him as one of the \"Greatest Three\", forever linked to the Belmont Family as a dear friend of his ancestors and a strong warrior. His surname is likely a reference to the historical [[House of D\u0103ne\u015fti]], who were persecuted by the historical Vlad III. Dracula is very similar to Vlad the Impaler in game, and is said to have killed Grant\u2019s family. This mirrors the real life Vlad Dracula who killed the whole D\u0103ne\u015fti Clan, who were the cousins of the family Vlad\u2019s grandfather usurped.\n\nWhile he has yet to appear in the Animated Series, Grant is referenced in Season 3 by both Trevor Belmont and Saint Germain, said to have \"a Horse-Drawn Sail-Boat on wheels and called himself 'The Pirate of the Roads'\". Writer Warren Ellis has confirmed this to be a nod to the character.\n\n===Sypha Belnades===\n{{nihongo|'''Sypha Belnades'''|\u30b5\u30a4\u30d5\u30a1\u30fb\u30f4\u30a7\u30eb\u30ca\u30f3\u30c7\u30b9|Saifa Verunandesu}} appears in ''Castlevania III'' and ''Castlevania: Judgment''. A [[priest]]ess (although she introduces herself as a vampire hunter to Trevor in the ''Castlevania III'' Japanese version) and [[witch]] of the church who uses elemental magic in battle, Sypha hid her gender to become a vampire hunter. She fought for the church to destroy evil, though her sister witches were hunted down by the church. She went on a journey to confront and destroy Dracula. On her way to the battle, she ended up in the Time Rift and decided to take it upon herself to defeat those tainted by darkness, despite which side they were on. Upon the defeat of the Time Reaper, she was returned to her own era (Judgment). She continued her journey to destroy Dracula, but was defeated by his minion, the [[Cyclops]], and imprisoned in stone. She was freed when Trevor Belmont killed the Cyclops and aided Trevor in his battle against Dracula. After Dracula's death, she and Trevor married, adding her magical [[aptitude]] to the Belmont bloodline.\n\nIn the manual included with the Japanese ''Dracula's Curse'', it is stated that she lost her parents when she was young and was found wandering near a monastery in Wallachia. She was adopted by the monks there. Judgment elaborates that she belonged to a coven of witches who were executed as a result of Dracula's scheming. In the Judgment storyline, it is revealed that Grant actually carried a torch for her since their first meeting in Castlevania, but lacking the resolve to confess to her his feelings, he lets her slip into Trevor Belmont's arms. Despite this, Sypha is said to have missed her friend when he chose to refuse his invitation to her marriage, patching up their friendship only after Grant's return from the Rift. Despite this brief moment of confusion, Sypha, Grant and Trevor are known in Belmont history as ''The Greatest Three'', friends and warriors supreme, an example to all her descendants to follow.\n\nIn ''Lords of Shadow \u2013 Mirror of Fate'', Sypha Belmont, n\u00e9e Belnades, is the wife of Trevor and the mother of Simon. She tries to comfort Trevor when he learns of his parents' fate, and sees him off as he ventures forth to battle Dracula. Following Trevor's death, Dracula's forces are unleashed and she is attacked, telling Simon to escape as she is killed by one of Dracula's werewolves. Years later, her soul is found by Simon beneath Dracula's castle, though he is unaware of her identity, and she joins him to protect him on his quest.\n\nIn the animated adaptation, Sypha is a member of a group of nomad scholars known as the Speakers who are demonized by the Church as they are falsely accused causing the attacks conducted by Dracula's army. She seeks out the \"sleeping soldier\" that she hopes will stop Dracula's attack, only to be turned to stone by a cyclops before being saved by Trevor Belmont, who helps her find Alucard and release him from his prison. In the Belmont estate's repository of knowledge, she finds an incomplete spell meant to force Dracula's castle to appear in a given place and trap it there. Completing the spell, she successfully casts it, allowing the trio to confront Dracula. After Alucard drives a wooden stake through Dracula's heart and Trevor beheads him, Sypha burns what's left with her magic.\n\nShe is voiced by Charlotte Emerson in ''Lords of Shadow \u2013 Mirror of Fate'' and Alejandra Reynoso in the [[Castlevania (TV series)|''Castlevania'' animated series]].\n\n===Alucard===\n{{Main|Alucard (Castlevania)}}\n{{nihongo|'''Alucard'''|\u30a2\u30eb\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9|Aruk\u0101do}} is Dracula's only child, the half-vampire son of the count and a human woman named Lisa. He appears in Castlevania III, Aria of Sorrow, Dawn of Sorrow, Judgment & Legends, and stars in Symphony of the Night. He is voiced by [[Robert Belgrade]] (Symphony of the Night) and [[Yuri Lowenthal]] (all other roles). A reference to the 1940s movie \"Son of Dracula\", Alucard is \"Dracula\" spelled backwards. This is a title Alucard seems to have adopted for himself, as his actual full name is Adrian Fahrenheit \u0162epe\u015f.\n\nAlucard also appeared in ''[[Captain N: The Game Master]]'' voiced by [[Ian James Corlett]].\n\nAlucard appears in ''[[Mirror of Fate]]'', the second game in the ''[[Lords of Shadow]]'' reboot series. It is revealed that this version of Alucard was originally Trevor Belmont, the son of Gabriel and Marie Belmont, before being turned into a vampire. Trevor grew up not knowing of his true origin until the Brotherhood of Light reveals to him who his parents were. Believing that Dracula murdered his mother in cold blood, he decides to pursue him, in the hopes of destroying him and bringing peace. During the fight, Trevor is defeated and stabbed with his Combat Cross. Dying and gazing at the Mirror of Fate, he finally realizes the truth of what really happened to Gabriel and feels sorry for him, calling him his father. Dracula, feeling confused, gazes at the mirror as well and learns who Trevor was all along. Remorseful for killing his own son who had been unknown to him the entire time, Dracula tries to bring him back to life by making him drink his blood, which seems to be in vain. Dracula mourns over his loss, and places Trevor in a coffin with the name Alucard, since he never learned his son's real name. Many years later, Alucard awakens, with pale white skin, white hair, and glowing orange eyes. He meets up with Dracula and his own son, Simon. Alucard tries to finish what he started, angry that his father turned him into a vampire. Dracula asks Alucard to join him in remaking the world and destroying the Brotherhood, but Alucard refuses. Dracula proceeds to attack Simon for being a Belmont, wishing to end the Belmont bloodline due to his hatred of his past life. Alucard and Simon manage to defeat Dracula, and part ways as Dracula's castle crumbles.\n\nAlucard also appears as a supporting character in the sequel, ''[[Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2]]'', playing an important role in his father's journey of redemption. He is playable in the DLC ''Revelations'' taking place shortly prior to the events of the main game. In the ''Lords of Shadow'' series Alucard is voiced by ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' actor [[Richard Madden]].\n\nAlucard also appears in the [[Castlevania (TV series)|''Castlevania'' animated series]] voiced by [[James Callis]]. He opposes Dracula's mission to eradicate humanity, but loses their first confrontation, forcing him into slumber to heal his wounds. He is awakened by Trevor Belmont and Sypha Belnades, and after testing them in battle, joins them in a quest to stop Dracula.\n\n===Hector===\n{{nihongo|'''Hector'''|\u30d8\u30af\u30bf\u30fc|Hekut\u0101}} is the devil forgemaster and the main protagonist of ''Curse of Darkness''. He betrayed Dracula and left for a normal life. He took back his devil forgemaster powers to defeat Isaac and once again bring peace back to the land. The player controls Hector in the normal play mode. He has silver hair and wields a war hammer or sword.\n\nIn the ''Castlevania'' animated series (voiced by [[Theo James]]) Hector is portrayed as a forgemaster for Dracula's castle, creating monsters from dead corpses. As a child, he was beaten and isolated for his penchant of resurrecting dead animals as pets. After burning down his house (parents included), he worked to perfect his craft in Necromancy, leading to his eventual recruitment into Dracula's Castle.\n\n===Isaac===\n{{nihongo|'''Isaac'''|\u30a2\u30a4\u30b6\u30c3\u30af|Aizakku}} appears in Curse of Darkness and Akumajo Dracula Pachislot. He is Hector's villainous rival who stayed loyal to Dracula after Trevor defeated him a few years before the start of the game. The player will fight Isaac a few times over the course of the game.\n\nIn the ''Castlevania'' animated series, (voiced by [[Adetokumboh M'Cormack]]), Isaac is portrayed as a former African slave who was whipped regularly for small offenses. His suffering led to him developing a complete disdain for humanity, and soon kills his master. Working as one of Dracula's generals, his loyalty comes from Dracula treating him with far more respect than any other human.\n\n===Julia Laforeze===\n{{nihongo|'''Julia Laforeze'''|\u30b8\u30e5\u30ea\u30a2\u30fb\u30e9\u30d5\u30a9\u30ec\u30fc\u30bc|Juria Rafor\u0113ze}} is Isaac's sister and a [[Witchcraft|witch]]. She provides items for the player in a shop. Hector notes she bears a resemblance to Rosaly, his deceased lover.\n\n===Saint Germain===\n{{nihongo|'''Saint Germain'''|\u30b5\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30eb\u30de\u30f3|Sanjeruman}} appears in Curse of Darkness and Akumajo Dracula Pachislot. He is a person against Death. He can travel through time. He constantly asks Hector to abandon his quest, but never succeeds.  He does fight Hector at one point in the game. His name is likely a reference to [[Comte de Saint-Germain|the historical figure of the same name]].\n\nHe is voiced by [[Bill Nighy]] in the animated series.\n\n===Angela===\n'''Angela''' is a magical dancing girl from the Akumajo Dracula Pachislot games. She aids Ralph C. Belmont on his quest to stop Dracula, who has prematurely risen again. She casts a spell that annihilates a horde of skeletons and during Ralph's battle with Dracula, she is able to use magic to resuscitate him to continue the battle.\n\n===Lenore===\n\nLenore is one of the four members in the Council of Sisters in Netflix's animated series. She is in charge of watching over their slave Hector and convincing him to forge them an army. Going against Carmilla, Lenore then gives Hector clothes and moves him to a candle-lit cell with a desk and a blanket. Over time, Hector falls for Lenore's charms. She tricks Hector by slipping a magic ring onto his finger as they are having sex, which enslaves him. Lenore presents the council with rings she had forged to make Hector's night creatures loyal to them. The ring will also instantly kill Hector if he attempts to run away from them. She is voiced by [[Jessica Brown Findlay]].\n\n===Sumi and Taka===\n\nIn Netflix's animated series, Sumi and Taka are Japanese vampire hunters who travel to Transylvania to be trained by Alucard. They were once enslaved by a vampire named Ch\u014d, who actually enlisted into Dracula's army, but was killed by Alucard in the previous season finale. Alucard originally suspected they were thieves but began to bond with them, going as far as showing them the Belmont Hold. While he was in his bed one night, they entered his room and proceeded to have sex with him, but they then suddenly restrain Alucard by using a trap. Taka and Sumi accuse Alucard of witholding his knowledge of magic from them and not teaching them how to operate the castle. Before they can stake him, he uses his sword to slit their throats. Following their betrayal, Alucard is later seen prostate and weeping on the floor. The series ends with Alucard at the castle's entrance, where he has left the impaled bodies of Sumi and Taka as a warning to future visitors. Sumi is voiced by [[Rila Fukushima]] and Taka is voiced by Toru Uchikado.\n\n==''Kid Dracula''==\n{{main|Kid Dracula (1990 video game)}}\nKid Dracula is a lighthearted spinoff of the Castlevania series set sometime in the distant future. In Japan, the series is called ''Akumaj\u014d Dracula Special: Boku Dracula-kun''. Though elements from the series have been referenced throughout the main Castlevania series, the series has not been listed on any timeline published by Konami.\n\n===Kid Dracula===\n'''Kid Dracula''' is a 10,009 year old being and the lord of Castlevania. He had to retake the castle from Galamoth to return to his throne. In the Game Boy sequel, Kid Dracula defeated Galamoth a second time after the being attempted to capture the castle again. Throughout the series, Kid Dracula makes references to his \"father\", hinting at him to be an alternative version of Alucard.\n\nIn ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'', Kid Dracula's shadow can sometimes be seen in the background of the Dracula's Castle stage, and he can also be obtained as a collectible Spirit.\n\n===Galamoth===\n{{nihongo|'''Galamoth'''|\u5927\u9b54\u738b\u30ac\u30e9\u30e2\u30b9|Daima\u014d Garamosu}} (aka Garamoth) is the Lord of Space. He is originally from the Kid Dracula series. Sometime in the distant future, Galamoth tried to take over the Dracula's Castle to become the new Demonlord, but was defeated by Kid Dracula (Kid Dracula Famicom/Mobile phones). He tried to retake the castle again, but was defeated a second time (Kid Dracula GB). Galamoth later appeared as an optional boss in Symphony of the Night, located in the Floating Catacombs. Galamoth appeared in Aria of Sorrow as a soul that allowed Soma Cruz to see past areas blocked by time.\n\nHe is referred to by name in ''Castlevania Judgment'' when the Time Reaper is defeated. He is implied to be the one who sent the Time Reaper back 10,000 years into the past destroy Dracula and erase history.\n\n==''Rondo of Blood'' and ''Symphony of the Night''==\n{{main|Castlevania: Rondo of Blood|Castlevania: Symphony of the Night}}\n\n===Richter Belmont===\n[[File:richter-rondosotn.jpg|right|thumb|120px|Richter Belmont, as he appears in ''[[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood|Rondo of Blood]]'' (top) and ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night|Symphony of the Night]]'' (bottom).]]\n{{nihongo|'''Richter Belmont'''|\u30ea\u30d2\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30d9\u30eb\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9|Rihit\u0101 Berumondo|Richter Belmondo}} has starred as a protagonist in ''Castlevania: Rondo of Blood'' (and its remakes), ''Symphony of the Night'', and ''Akumaj\u014d Dracula: The Medal'' (an arcade medallion slot game). His first appearance is the main character in ''[[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood]]''.  In ''Symphony of the Night'', a direct sequel which takes place five years later, he became a brainwashed primary antagonist; however, completing the game unlocks an option to play the entire game as Richter. However, there is an alternate ending to ''Symphony of the Night'' that suggests that he was the cause of Dracula's return. He is also playable in an extra mode in ''[[Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin]]''.\n\nHero of the ''[[Castlevania: Dracula X]]'' games and a major character in ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]'', Richter had to battle legions of [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]]'s monsters to save his love interest Annette. In ''Symphony of the Night'', Richter mysteriously disappears upon investigating Dracula's recently reconstructed castle. It is later revealed that he was brainwashed by Shaft, a dark priest and servant of Dracula. Players will end up facing Richter: killing him will result in one of two bad endings, whereas saving him will continue the game.\n\nIn his first two appearances, as well as the prologue for the third, Richter wears a headband and a blue uniform. In ''Symphony of the Night'', only in the Saturn version following the prologue, his hair is noticeably longer and his attire appears more regal. He also gains a few new abilities, notably a dash, a slide attack, and a super jump that doubles as an uppercut.\n\nIn ''Portrait of Ruin'', Jonathan Morris fights a recreation of Richter (called \"Whip's Memory\") in a test created by Stella and Loretta Lecarde to unlock the Vampire Killer's full power, as he is the last known Belmont to wield the whip before [[List of characters in Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow and Dawn of Sorrow#Julius Belmont|Julius Belmont]] killed Dracula in 1999. Richter also appears in the game as one of the Five Greatest. Richter appears in the 2018 crossover [[fighting game]] ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' as a playable character alongside his ancestor Simon.<ref name=\"SmashBros\"/>\n\nRichter is voiced by [[David Vincent (voice actor)|David Vincent]] in the PSP remake of ''Rondo of Blood'', the PSP version of ''Symphony of the Night'', and ''Super Smash Bros. Ultimate''. His height is 5\u20194 in game, however in Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, he is 5\u20196.\n\n===Maria Renard===\n{{nihongo|'''Maria Renard'''|\u30de\u30ea\u30a2\uff65\u30e9\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c9|Maria R\u0101neddo}} is a local village girl with the power to control the [[Four Symbols (China)]] of [[Chinese mythology]]. She appears in the PC Engine video game ''Akumaj\u014d Dracula X: Rondo of Blood'' (and its remakes ''Dracula X Chronicles'' for PSP and ''Castlevania Dracula X'' for Super NES), as well as in ''Symphony of the Night'', ''Castlevania Judgment'', and ''Akumaj\u014d Dracula: The Medal''. She is a distant blood relative of the Belmont clan<ref>{{cite web |title=''Rondo of Blood'' manual |website=The CastleVania Dungeon |url=http://castlevaniadungeon.net/games/rondomanual.html |access-date=2006-08-15}}</ref><ref>Castlevania Judgement Manual, pg 21</ref> (no mention of that connection is to be found in ''[[Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles]]'', where she is instead said to be the daughter of a local lord). In the Super NES version of ''[[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood#Castlevania: Dracula X|Castlevania: Dracula X]]'', she's also said to be the sister of Richter's beloved Annette, a detail that's not alluded to in the other games. She was later adopted by the Belmont family in ''[[Castlevania Judgment]]''.\n\nIn 1792, Maria's parents were killed, and she was captured, along with several other young women, and taken to Dracula's castle. Richter Belmont saved Maria from Shaft, one of Dracula's servants, who was attempting to cast a spell on her. Once Maria is rescued, she becomes playable and uses various magically enhanced animal attacks for combat. There exists an ending in which Maria confronts and defeats the Count instead of Richter. In the introduction sequence to ''Symphony of the Night'' (a retelling of the final boss battle ''Rondo of Blood''), if Richter's health completely runs out, a 12-year-old Maria will appear and amplify Richter with her magic in his effort to defeat Dracula. ''Judgment'' further explains that she fought alongside Richter in defeating Dracula and has power that rivals the Belmonts. Unlike Annette, if you fail to save her in ''Rondo of Blood'', you will not face her at the end.\n\nFour years after the defeat of Dracula, Richter vanished. Maria immediately set out to find him. After a year of searching, in 1797, she finally found Castlevania. In the castle she learned that Richter was working in concert with the dark forces.  With Maria's help, the half-vampire [[Alucard (Castlevania)|Alucard]] was able to break Shaft's hold on Richter and defeat Dracula. Depending on certain player actions in Symphony, the player will receive different endings. In one, Maria will admit to not being able to live without Alucard and go after him. In another, she will resign herself due to the fact that she cannot ease his torment and returns home with Richter.\n\nMaria also appears in ''Judgment,'' with a more bratty personality. She constantly trips and miscalculates her powerful magics, for comedic effect, and she acts mostly unaware of the Time Rift's nature, for example believing that Simon and Trevor merely stole the Vampire Killer from her friend Richter. She is also seemingly obsessed with her young age and diminutive body, going so far to openly complain against Carmilla and Shanoa for their developed bodies, and claim that Sypha's large breasts are a \"gift from God\", lashing out to her for suggesting that her beauty may pose a liability in combat.\n\n===Shaft===\n{{nihongo|'''Shaft'''|\u30b7\u30e3\u30d5\u30c8|Shafuto}} is a dark priest that appears as antagonist in ''[[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood|Akumaj\u014d Dracula X Chi no Rondo]]'' and ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]''. In 1792, Shaft aids [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]] in his plans to kidnap several young women. He is defeated by Richter after conjuring several [[monsters]] in an attempt to defeat him. Later in the game, Shaft's ghost makes a final attempt to stop the hero.\n\nIn 1797, Dracula's monsters kidnap Richter and [[brainwashing|brainwash]] him. Shaft is instrumental in using his evil powers to control Richter, turning him against anyone who seeks to defy Dracula. Maria guesses that he is under their influence and helps Alucard to see past Shaft's deception. Alucard is able to save Richter instead of killing him, and goes on to defeat Shaft, although not before Shaft successfully revives Dracula just before being stopped for good.\n\n===Annette===\n{{nihongo|'''Annette'''|\u30a2\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8|Anetto}} is Richter's fianc\u00e9e.  In ''[[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood]]''\u2014and also ''Dracula X'' for the SNES and ''Dracula X Chronicles'' for the PSP\u2014she was kidnapped by Dracula's minions, along with Maria, Iris, and Terra. Failing to save her will result in having to face her as a possessed vampiress in ''Dracula X'' and ''The Dracula X Chronicles''. In the English localization of the SNES game ''[[Castlevania: Dracula X]]'', her name was spelled as \"'''Anett'''\" during the game's intro storyline. Depicted as a purple haired young girl in her original ''Rondo of Blood'' design, she was redesigned as a blonde in the same way as Maria, and wearing more aristocratic attire in ''Dracula X'' for the SNES and in ''Chronicles'' for the PSP.\n\n===Iris and Tera===\n{{nihongo|'''Tera'''|\u30c6\u30e9|Tera}} is the head nun of Richter's village, and {{nihongo|'''Iris'''|\u30a4\u30ea\u30b9|Irisu}} is the doctor's daughter. They were kidnapped by Dracula's minions to taunt Richter, along with Annette and Maria. Tera sees Richter as a warrior of God and Maria as angel sent by Heaven, thanking them both for saving her. Iris, being a doctor's daughter, helps heal the wounds of the duo when they rescue her as a show of thanks.\n\n===Lisa===\n{{nihongo|'''Lisa'''|\u30ea\u30b5|Risa}} is Alucard's mother and Dracula's second wife, seeing past her husband's personality to see the lonely man he truly is. She was executed on the charge of witchcraft after healing villagers with [[penicillin]], spurring Dracula's genocidal vendetta against humanity. Alucard witnessed her death and promised her not to hate humans and tells Dracula she will love him for eternity, which Alucard relays in ''Symphony of the Night''.\n\nIn the animated adaptation, her story remains the same with the exception that she was accused of witchcraft because she reverse engineered the more advanced technology Dracula possessed to improve the lives of the Wallachian people which the church condemned as the devil's work.\n\nShe is voiced by [[Emily Swallow]] in the [[Castlevania (TV series)|''Castlevania'' animated series]].\n\n===Golem===\n'''[[Golem]]''' is a recurring character found throughout the Castlevania series. His first appearance was in Rondo of Blood.<ref>Castlevania Judgement Manual, pg 24</ref> Golem was originally created by Carmilla to be a mindless guard of ancient ruins.

He is a descendant of the Belmont family, and wields the Vampire Killer whip, much like his ancestors. John died some time after the events of ''Bloodlines'', as it was revealed his wounds wouldn't heal. This was caused by his using the [[Vampire Killer whip]], which would sap the strength of someone that was not a full-blooded descendant of the Belmont lineage, but by the time John learned this, it was too late.\n\n''Bloodlines'' is deeply intertwined with the storyline of Bram Stoker's [[Dracula]].  As such, the father of John Morris is Quincy Morris, a character from the novel. It is only known that the Morrises are somehow of Belmont lineage. In the novel, Quincy stabs Dracula at the cost of his life, while Harker cuts off Dracula's head. However, that fact he managed to unknowingly deal a crippling blow to Dracula may have been the foundation for his part in the ''Castlevania'' version of these events.\n\n===Eric Lecarde===\n{{nihongo|'''Eric Lecarde'''|\u30a8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30ea\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9|Erikku Rik\u0101do}} appears in Bloodlines, Portrait of Ruin, and Judgment. Born on May 3, 1892 in Segovia, Spain, he uses the Alucard Spear (mistranslated as \"Alcarde Spear\" in ''Bloodlines''). The spear was created by Alucard to complement the power of the Vampire Killer, and fight alongside the Morris line. When Elizabeth Bartley attempted to revive Dracula, Eric volunteered to fight alongside his friend John Morris in the hunt. However, he had not told John the real reason behind his appetite for vengeance: the Countess turned the love of his life, Gwendolyn, into a vampire.\n\nYears later, Eric set out towards Dracula's Castle to investigate its reappearance, but was slain by the vampire Brauner. Unbeknownst to him, Eric's daughters had followed him into the castle and bore witness to his death, but both were then bitten by Brauner and turned into vampires. Unable to cross into the afterlife, Eric's ghost remained in the castle and was later met by Jonathan Morris and Charlotte Aulin. Initially calling himself \"Wind\", Eric tested the pair's abilities with various side-quests. After being confronted by Jonathan following a skirmish with Stella, in which a locket holding a photo of him and his daughters was recovered, Eric disclosed his true identity and the full story behind himself, his daughters, and Jonathan's father. Once his daughters are rescued and Brauner and Dracula are both destroyed, Eric appears before his friends and family and gives them one last heartfelt moment together before crossing over into the afterlife.\n\nIn ''Judgment'', Eric believed that the spear's potential was greater than the whip, and sought to prove that. While training he found himself in a time rift, having been brought there by Aeon. Eric believed the rift would give him a chance to prove the spear's potential against the Vampire Killer. After the defeat of Galamoth he was returned to his own time (Judgment).\n\n===Elizabeth Bartley===\nAccording to the game's story, {{nihongo|'''Elizabeth Bartley'''|\u30a8\u30ea\u30b6\u30d9\u30fc\u30c8\u30fb\u30d0\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc|Erisab\u0113to B\u0101tor\u012b}} is Dracula's niece, raised back from the dead by her servant {{nihongo|Drolta Tzuentes|\u30c9\u30ed\u30c6\u30a2\u30fb\u30c4\u30a7\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9|Dorotea Tsentesu}}. She triggered the start of [[World War I]] by assassinating the Crown Prince of Austria, then gathered the souls of those who died in the war to revive Dracula. In the final stage, she initially fights John and Eric in the form of a Medusa, then attacks with elemental spells before ultimately being killed.\n\nShe is based on the actual Countess [[Erzs\u00e9bet B\u00e1thory]], and was likely intended to ''be'' her, as B\u00e1thory's first name is commonly anglicized to \"Elizabeth\", and the name \"Bartley\" likely being a mistranslation.\n\n===Drolta Tzuentes===\n\n'''Drolta Tzuentes''' is a subservient witch of [[List of Castlevania characters#Elizabeth Bartley|Elizabeth Bartley]] (the American ''Castlevania: Bloodlines'' instruction book gives contradictory information, saying that she is an \"amateur witch\" who \"casts a spell which inadvertently brings Elizabeth Bartley back to life\"), who resurrects her master. Drolta then accompanies Elizabeth in their plot to resurrect Count Dracula.\n\nDrolta Tzuentes is based on Dorottya Szentes (Dorottya Semt\u00e9sz) who is one of the servants of [[Erzs\u00e9bet B\u00e1thory]] (the historical version of Elizabeth Bartley) who, along with 2 others, are said to have been tried, convicted, and executed as accomplices to the crimes down by the noblewoman.\n\n===Jonathan Morris===\n{{nihongo|'''Jonathan Morris'''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30ca\u30b5\u30f3\u30fb\u30e2\u30ea\u30b9|Jonasan Morisu}} is a member of the Morris family of vampire hunters and appears in ''[[Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin]]''. The wielder of the Vampire Killer in 1944, Jonathan received basic training from his father John Morris as a child. He tends to be a reckless youth, a trait which makes his childhood friend Charlotte Aulin worry about his well being much of the time. He can, however, be very observant. After his father died, Jonathan grew to resent him, though neither he nor Charlotte knew that the soul-sapping effects of a non-Belmont using the Vampire Killer in battle resulted in his death.\n\nAfter learning the truth about his father and the Vampire Killer from Eric, Jonathan gained a new found respect for his father. Jonathan may then choose whether or not to battle the whip's memory of Richter Belmont, the last Belmont to wield the whip, and successfully unleash the full power of the Vampire Killer, knowing full well that he may perish from using it, though it is up to the player to decide whether to engage this optional encounter, and the canonical choice is unknown. Regardless, Jonathan and Charlotte traveled to the top of Dracula's Castle, and battled the combined forces of Count Dracula and [[Death (Castlevania)|Death]], which had not previously occurred before according to Charlotte. When Dracula was vanquished, his castle was destroyed and Jonathan and the others escaped unscathed.\n\n===Charlotte Aulin===\n{{nihongo|'''Charlotte Aulin'''|\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30aa\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3|Sh\u0101rotto \u014crin}} is a magic user said to be descended from the Belnades clan. She shows strong potential as a sorceress. Along with Jonathan, she ventures into the castle to destroy Dracula. She is a smart girl who relies on enchanted books for information, to cast spells, and to summon weapons for close-range attacks. She also tends to be a nosy and talkative person, which is how she found out about Jonathan and the Vampire Killer, something which, according to Jonathan, she was supposed to keep secret. Charlotte is concerned about Jonathan's ability to wield the whip and assists him with the best she can, but she hates getting treated as (or even being called) a child. She tends to take things rationally and logically, which makes her seem unemotional but she is in fact a caring and compassionate young woman.\n\n===Brauner===\n{{nihongo|'''Brauner'''|\u30d6\u30ed\u30fc\u30cd\u30eb|Bur\u014dneru}} is a famous painter who forsook his humanity after losing his daughters during World War I. Now a vampire, he screams for vengeance upon humanity for their deaths.\n\nWhen Dracula's Castle first appeared, Brauner used his special paintings to keep Dracula sealed so that he could keep the dark lord's power all for himself. Eric Lecarde set off to investigate the castle, but was ambushed by Brauner and slain. At the same time, Eric's daughters Stella and Loretta arrived to bear witness to their father's death, and Brauner bit both girls so as to turn them into his new vampiric \"daughters\".\n\nWhen Jonathan and Charlotte finally confront Brauner, he flies into a rage over having lost his \"daughters\" again and attacks the pair. As he is defeated, Brauner explains the reasons for his actions, but is then slain by Death in order to revive Dracula.\n\n===Stella and Loretta===\n{{nihongo|'''Stella'''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30e9|Sutera}} and {{nihongo|'''Loretta'''|\u30ed\u30ec\u30c3\u30bf|Roretta}} are the daughters of Eric Lecarde, the older sister Stella being a master swordswoman with powerful wind-based attacks while Loretta wields powerful ice spells while serving as Stella's support. The vampire Brauner believe the two of them to be the reincarnations of his deceased daughters, having turned them to vampires and subjected them to a spell that causes their past lives to take control of them.\n\nBrauner's \"daughters\" initially prevent Jonathan and Charlotte from investigating the castle. After a short fight with Stella, the two learn of the sisters' true identities when they find a locket containing a picture with both girls and Eric Lecarde, prompting Eric's ghost to reveal what happened to his daughters. The four of them later confront each other in the highest areas of the castle. While it is possible to kill the sisters (triggering a bad ending), Jonathan and Charlotte must use the \"Sanctuary\" spell to restore Stella and Loretta to their true selves. Their minds and humanity restored, the sisters open a door that leads to Brauner's studio and also offer Jonathan a way to unlock the true power of the Vampire Killer.\n\nUpon defeating Dracula, Jonathan, Charlotte, Stella, and Loretta escape the castle, where Eric appears before them and tells his daughters to not burden themselves over their actions and move. Eric passes to the other side, leaving Stella and Loretta in tears, but they soon recover and thank Jonathan and Charlotte.\n\nStella and Loretta are playable in \"Sisters Mode\", which takes place before the main game and chronicles their search for their missing father. Unlike Jonathan and Charlotte, the player use the stylus to attack and the D-Pad to move them around, as they can also fly. As Stella, the player attacks enemies by slicing enemies with the stylus, and as Loretta, the player points at enemies to shoot a beam of ice.\n\n===Vincent Dorin===\n{{nihongo|'''Vincent Dorin'''|\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8\u30fb\u30c9\u30ea\u30f3|Vinsento Dorin}} is a [[priest]] that serves as the game merchant. Jonathan and Charlotte meet him in front of the castle and then near the entrance. Vincent is a rather greedy person, even if he explains that it is for the church. He also get bitten during the game and begs the two heroes to cure him (the player can choose to cure him or not, and while it affects the ending, it is not something noticeable). Even when cured, he isn't as much in debt concerning his merchandise.\n\nHis name was reused for an abbot in the reboot, ''Lords of Shadow''. He went insane by isolating himself and protecting a priceless artifact, while his townspeople were being slaughtered by supernatural creatures.\n\n==''Castlevania (Nintendo 64)'' and ''Legacy of Darkness''==\n{{main|Castlevania (Nintendo 64)|Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness}}\nIGA claimed in 2006 that ''Castlevania'' and ''Legacy of Darkness'' for the [[Nintendo 64]] were considered side projects to his timeline.<ref name=\"1up.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=4&cId=3152109 |title=Tales From The Crypt: Castlevania 20th Anniversary Blowout from |publisher=1UP.com |date=1997-10-31 |accessdate=2013-08-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215534/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=4&cId=3152109 |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}</ref> However, the games were later listed on the 20th Anniversary Timeline, without any description.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/puyo/314073086/in/set-72157594405290664/ |title=DSC01722 &#124; Flickr \u2013 Condivisione di foto! |publisher=Flickr.com |date=2006-12-04 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref> IGA later clarified that he looks at the titles as \"...a Castlevania \"gaiden\" (subseries)\" and complemented them by stating \"...they both have a really unique take on the Castlevania world.\"<ref>Nintendo Power, July 2008</ref>  Iga later included Cornell in Castlevania Judgment (Nov 2008) (drawn from his era of the timeline by magical forces<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coveritlive.com/index2.php?option=com_altcaster&task=viewaltcast&altcast_code=9cfac7534b&ipod=y |title=Viewer \u2013 Konami's E3 press conference |publisher=Coveritlive.com |date=2008-07-16 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref>). The game and manual makes references to Legacy of Darkness story.

He is the son of Michael Gelhart Schneider. Villagers have been found mutilated and drained of blood near Dracula's castle, and Reinhardt has to stop it.  He carries the typical Vampire Killer whip but can also wield a shortsword for close-range combat for which the whip may prove unsuitable; although the surname \"Schneider\" usually carries the same connotation as does the English surname \"Tailor,\" its literal translation from German is the more general \"one who cuts.\"\n\nHe is voiced by Andrew Hanikson.\n\n===Carrie Fern\u00e1ndez===\n{{nihongo|'''Carrie Fern\u00e1ndez'''|\u30ad\u30e3\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30f4\u30a7\u30eb\u30ca\u30f3\u30c7\u30b9|Kyar\u012b Verunandesu}} is a magic-wielding girl descended from the Belnades clan. She was estranged from the populace of Wallachia for her affinity with magic, her mother dying to protect her from an angry mob. She turned her back on others, but when she learned that Dracula had once again risen, she took it upon herself to use her powers to stop him. She is Camilla Fern\u00e1ndez's cousin, who is also captured by a vampire and turned into one.\n\nShe is voiced by [[Bianca Allen]].\n\n===Actrise===\n{{nihongo|'''Actrise'''|\u30a2\u30af\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30bb|Akutor\u012bse}} is a Dracula's [[Witchcraft|witch]] servant, she sacrificed her own child to become immortal. She plays an antagonist role in Carrie's quest, offering her a chance to join Dracula, in which Carrie refuses. In the Castle Center, Actrise sics a Fern\u00e1ndez warrior, who became a vampire, on Carrie in an attempt to stop her from reaching Dracula. After Carrie defeats her cousin, she and Actrise do battle on top of one of the castle towers, in which Actrise is overwhelmed and killed by Carrie. She also appears in Cornell's quest and taunts him, and is revealed to be responsible for turning Henry's father into a vampire.\n\n===Rosa===\n{{nihongo|'''Rosa'''|\u30ed\u30fc\u30bc|R\u014dze|Rose}} is a woman who was recently turned into a [[vampire]]. She meets Reinhardt and Carrie in the Villa, watering flowers with blood. She plays a major role in Reinhardt's quest. She is seen next attempting to kill herself, walking into sunlight. Reinhardt stops her. She is then encountered with Death in the Castle Center in which she and Reinhardt do battle. She is defeated by him but is spared before Death takes her away. When Death ambushes Reinhardt, Rosa sacrifices herself by throwing herself into the path of Death's scythes. Rosa is comforted by Reinhardt as she dies, and then Death is defeated by a vengeful Reinhardt. In the end, after Dracula's defeat, Rosa is seen restored into human form and she and Reinhardt look upon Dracula's sunken castle.\n\n===Gilles de Rais===\n{{nihongo|'''Gilles de Rais'''|\u30b8\u30eb\u30fb\u30c9\u30ec|Jiru Dore}} is one of Dracula's servants. He used Cornell's power to reincarnate his master in the body of Malus. He later disguises himself as Dracula in preparation for his lord's eventual resurrection and kidnapped children to offer them as sacrifice and thus resurrect his master. He is later defeated by Reinhardt and Carrie in Dracula's throne room, where it is revealed he was an imposter.\n\n===Renon===\n{{nihongo|'''Renon'''|\u30ec\u30ce\u30f3|Renon}} is a demonic salesman who appears intermittently throughout the game. He claims that \"one needs gold even in Hell these days\", and will gladly sell the player various power-ups such as spells and potions. Renon can be summoned by picking up a contract scroll that appears in various levels. The scroll then turns into an open briefcase. If the player spends more than 30,000 gold pieces before encountering Dracula, Renon transforms into his demon form and attempts to claim your soul for Hell.\n\n===Charles Vincent===\n{{nihongo|'''Charles Vincent'''|\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30eb\u30ba\u30d3\u30f3\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8|Ch\u0101ruzu Vinsento}} is a vampire hunter. His mannerisms seem to indicate that he is very intelligent, but lacks real experience with vampires or other evils. Charles plays a key role in the game.\n\nIf the player takes less time in reaching the Castle Keep and defeats Dracula for the first time, he changes back into Malus, but Charles douses him with holy water, before Dracula warps the player to an alternate dimension for the final battle. After Dracula's defeat, Charles' fate is unknown.\n\nHowever, if the player takes more time in reaching the Castle Keep, Charles will arrive before them. He will fail in his attempt to subdue Dracula, and will be turned into a vampire instead. The player will be forced to fight and kill Charles. If this happens, then the heroes will not see through Dracula's illusions and ultimately fail in their quest.\n\n===Cornell===\n{{nihongo|'''Cornell'''|\u30b3\u30fc\u30cd\u30eb|K\u014dneru}}, also known as \"Blue Crescent Moon\", is a [[werewolf]] seen in both ''[[Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness]]'' and ''[[Castlevania Judgment]]''. He is a member of a warrior clan cursed to turn into beastmen. He is the only member of his clan who had the ability to control his change. He was the only one of his brethren who refused to join the forces of Dracula. He honed his skills in the hopes of finding a cure for his clan and to protect his sister Ada. One day while out training he found himself unable to control his powers and was stuck in beast form (''Castlevania Judgement''). He encountered Aeon, a time traveler, who told him he had entered a time rift. Aeon challenged him, and told him the time rift would let him learn more about the nature of the curse. After encountering several champions from different eras, he learns from Camilla and Death that they still need him, and is told that there is a possibility of a cure for him (though he doesn't trust them). After the defeat of the Time Reaper, Cornell was returned to his own era, 1844. He returned to find his village in flame, and his sister Ada kidnapped. He then journeyed after the kidnappers to save his sister. He discovered that Dracula's castle had risen again, and that his fellow man-beast Ortega had kidnapped his sister. During his battles he saves the young Henry Oldrey, and later defeats Ortega. He learned from Ortega, that Death, Gilles De Rais, and Actrise had plotted the kidnapping of Ada to empower a newly raised Dracula. Dracula later reveals to the audience that his sister is not a blood relative. Cornell fights Dracula to save her causing Dracula to be pulled into a vortex of energy. Dracula traps Cornell with his last power and tries to take Ada with him. The beast within Cornell freed itself from his body and saves Ada, but is captured and pulled into the vortex by Dracula. Cornell had become fully human, and was able to live the rest of a normal life with Ada (Legacy of Darkness).\n\nAccording to IGA, \"I believe many people did not expect to see Cornell. I really wanted to include a beast man type character, so I picked him.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cubed3.com/news/11037 |title=Interview: IGA-san Talks Castlevania Judgment on Nintendo Wii #1 at Nintendo Cubed3 |publisher=Cubed3.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref>\n\nHe is voiced by John Nuzzo (Legacy of Darkness).\n\nA new version of Cornell appears in Lords of Shadow, voiced by [[Richard Ridings]]. He is the Dark Lord of the Lycans and the first Lords of Shadow Gabriel encounters.\n\n===Ortega===\n{{nihongo|'''Ortega'''|\u30aa\u30eb\u30c6\u30ac|Orutega}} grew up in the same village as Cornell, a fellow man-beast, being a friend of his, but also a rival. The rivalry caused Ortega an increasing amount of frustration, as he was constantly being outdone on every occasion, and he started searching for a way to gain the kind of powers that would make him stronger than even Cornell.\n\nThis search led him on the path of darkness, as the only one able to grant him the request proved to be Dracula. As a condition for gaining the new powers, Dracula demanded of Ortega to aid his demons on their mission to kidnap Cornell's sister Ada and destroy the village. He was also to stop Cornell from rescuing Ada. Ortega accepted these conditions, and thus sealed his pact with the devil, gaining amazing power, but losing his humanity.\n\nOrtega eventually fights Cornell as a Chimera on top one of the castle towers, but is defeated by him. Ortega accepts his defeat, but with his powers becoming out of control, he leaps off the castle tower to his death.\n\n===Henry Oldrey===\n{{nihongo|'''Henry Oldrey'''|\u30d8\u30f3\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30aa\u30eb\u30c9\u30ec\u30fc|Henr\u012b Orudor\u0113}} is the son of Mary and J.

He lost both parents at a very young age, and was knighted at the age of 16. When his love interest Sara Trantoul is kidnapped by the vampire [[Walter Bernhard]] he enters the castle grounds unarmed, but is given a whip that is blessed with the power of alchemy by the old man Rinaldo Gandolfi, who lives on the grounds. Rinaldo also enchants Leon's left gauntlet with the power to absorb magical attacks. Using the whip and his magic gauntlet, he enters the castle hoping to rescue his fianc\u00e9e.\n\nWithin the castle, Leon fights five guardians: Medusa, a Succubus, a Golem, the vampire [[Joachim Armster]] (Walter Bernhard's former ally), and an undead parasite. He gets a magical orb from each of them that unlocks the way to Walter's lair. When he gets past the initial barrier, Walter is there with Sara, who appears to be in some sort of trance. Walter returns Sara to Leon, who finds out that Sara has been tainted and will soon become a vampire. In an act of self-sacrifice, Sara offers her soul to Leon in a ritual that will make Rinaldo's magic whip deadly to vampires and thus allow Leon to defeat Walter. This is where the whip officially becomes \"Vampire Killer.\"  Leon, armed with the powerful whip, Rinaldo's grief, and his anger for Sara's death, defeats Walter. However, Walter's death was in actuality orchestrated by Leon's friend [[Mathias Cronqvist]] to get Walter's Soul, and absorb its powers to become a powerful vampire through the Crimson Stone, (an artifact that allowed a person to steal a Vampire's soul and make their power theirs, at the price of becoming a vampire themselves) and Vampire Killer can now sense his having abandoned Humanity. He offers Leon eternal life, which Leon refuses, saying that eternal life would be empty without Sara. Mathias then sends his servant Death after Leon, who is defeated by him and gives him a message to pass on to Mathias. Leon swears that his clan and the whip he now carries will destroy Mathias one day, and from that day onward the Belmont clan would hunt the night.

She is the most prodigious member of the Order of Ecclesia, a secret organization devoted to stop Dracula from reviving after the Belmont clan disappeared. She is also a glyph user, capable of absorbing sigil-like characters and using them as weapons. She is chosen by Barlowe to bear Dominus, a series of glyphs designed to destroy Dracula, but her fellow member Albus interferes during the ceremony and steals the glyphs. As a result, Shanoa becomes an amnesiac who is only able to simulate emotions (she cannot truly feel them).\n\nAfter being retrained by Barlowe, Shanoa is dispatched to seek out and retrieve Dominus from Albus by any means necessary. As she travels, she slowly learns Albus's true intentions and the dark reality behind Ecclesia, but she is unable to stop the return of Dracula. With nothing left to her except her mission, Shanoa enters Dracula's castle and destroys the evil count using Dominus.\n\nShe is voiced by [[Houko Kuwashima]].\n\n===Albus===\n{{nihongo|'''Albus'''|\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30b9|Arubasu}} is one of Ecclesia's veteran members.

Initially, Barlowe promised Albus that he would receive the Dominus seal, but changed his mind without his consent and chose Shanoa instead. After stealing Dominus from Ecclesia during the ceremony in which it was to be implanted within Shanoa, Albus flees with the glyph and becomes the enemy of Ecclesia. He spends much of the time researching the Dominus glyph and devising a way to incorporate it into himself. However, when he absorbs one part of the glyph (as he had given the other two away in order to observe how glyphs are absorbed) he is driven mad and Shanoa is forced to slay him.\n\nIf Shanoa kills Albus after rescuing all of the villagers, Albus will speak to her through Dominus and reveal his intentions in stealing the glyph. He had acted the way he did in order to protect Shanoa, who was raised as his younger sister, from the soul-stealing effects of the glyph, as channeling it would kill the user. He also has her promise not to use Dominus, as it would kill her. She also gains Albus' memories, some of which correlate with the ones she had lost. As it transpires, Albus's soul remains within Shanoa as she explores Dracula's castle, and he uses this opportunity to find a way to unlock her emotions, though her own memories are forever lost. When Shanoa uses Dominus to destroy Dracula, Albus offers his own soul as sacrifice, allowing Shanoa to live. Before his soul vanishes, Albus restores Shanoa's emotions and asks that she smile for him, which she manages through deep tears.\n\nHe is voiced by [[Keith Silverstein]].\n\n===Barlowe===\n{{nihongo|'''Barlowe'''|\u30d0\u30fc\u30ed\u30a6|B\u0101rou}} is Ecclesia's leader, who has been tasked with seeking a way to combat Dracula's power in the absence of the Belmont clan. To this end, he created the Dominus glyph out of Dracula's power and was in the process of giving them to Shanoa when Albus interfered and made off with the glyphs. When Shanoa returns after learning the truth about Dominus and the cost for its use, Barlowe reveals that he himself has been corrupted by Dracula's power, and that his goal all along was to have Shanoa sacrifice her soul to Dracula through Dominus so the evil count can return once more. After Shanoa critically wounds him in battle, Barlowe uses the last of his strength to bring Dracula to life again.\n\n===Villagers of Wygol===\nIn her travels, Shanoa encounters villagers from a location called Wygol, whom Albus captures and takes blood from in his studies on Dominus. After being rescued, the villagers will offer various side-quests for Shanoa to complete in exchange for money and special items. Shanoa must rescue all thirteen of the villagers in order to continue the storyline after defeating Albus.\n\nAfter Albus's death, the villagers are revealed to be indirect descendants of the Belmont clan, and their blood is what allows Albus's soul to live within Shanoa after he himself is killed.\n\n==''Judgment''==\n{{main|Castlevania Judgment}}\nAccording to Iga, \"So as many of you know, the Castlevania timeline goes over 1000 years\", \"And there is a character trying to destroy that timeline.

It is not known who his original parents were. Some suspect he was the unwanted child of a local wealthy landowner, most likely from the Cronqvist family, though this has never been proven. The Order named the boy after the blessed Archangel Gabriel and raised him as one of their own. The precocious child quickly proved to be extremely talented, developing a mastery of the fighting arts unprecedented in the Brotherhood. Gabriel took the surname of Belmont, due to his love for mountains and the high places of the world. The name Belmont is of French origin, and it means \"beautiful mountain\". The name is the union of two French words: ''bel'', meaning beautiful and ''mont'' meaning mountain.\n\nProne to dark moods and occasional ambivalence, Gabriel was deeply affected by the death of his childhood sweetheart, Marie.

After his Acolytes manage to summon him to the mortal world, this time Satan chooses to possess Alucard, the son of Gabriel, who is now known as the powerful vampire Dracula. After his defeat, he flees from Alucard's body and is killed by Dracula, who uses his old Vampire Killer weapon to deliver the final blow.\n\nVoiced by [[Jason Isaacs]].\n\n===Victor Belmont===\nVictor Belmont is a descendant of Gabriel Belmont, although his exact relation is unknown. Victor claims to be the last of the Belmont lineage.\n\nVoiced by [[Anthony Howell (actor)|Anthony Howell]].\n\n===Toy Maker===\n\nAt a time, the Toy Maker was the brightest pupil of Rinaldo Gandolfi;  Though, he much preferred to build toys for children and the skill that gave him his name made him legendary across the lands.  However, hearing of his skill was Walter Bernhard, a member of the Bernhard family who offered the Toy Maker a place in his Castle to make his craft.\n\nIn time, the Toy Maker realized that Walter came from a family of dark occultists. Walter summoned a demon to possess the Toy Maker's kindly soul, thereby twisting his craft in the darkest way and making weapons of death and destruction, some being the Dark Pain, the Stopwatch, the Macabre Puppet, and Gargoyles.\n\nThe demon, however, was unable to completely corrupt the Toy Maker's soul, resulting in something of a split personality; the original kind old man and the childish, sadistic demon within. Sometime during this period, the Toy Maker was touched by the puppet of a child seeking to free his soul from the demon and escape Walter Bernhard. He then discovered he had regained his innocence and Walter removed his heart, putting the Toy Maker into a deep slumber.\n\nHis fate is unknown when Carmilla took over the castle, and only then until Gabriel Belmont, rechristened as Dracula, took over as well.\n\nVoiced by Mark Healy.\n\n===Agreus===\n\nAgreus is the brother of the deceased Pan, coming to Dracula's Castle to seek revenge against his killer, the vampire lord Dracula. First Agreus lures Dracula into the Castle's gardens with a fragment of the Mirror of Fate knowing that he would seek the fragment for his son Trevor Belmont. As Dracula attempts to claim the fragment, Agreus steals it from him and informs the vampire that he intends to avenge Pan's death. Dracula tries to reason with Agreus that his brother chose to sacrifice himself for a cause that he believed in, but Agreus retorts that Pan only died to serve his quest for power. Declaring that Dracula would pay for what he had done, Agreus retreats into the maze, goading the vampire to follow him.\n\nNow trapped inside the maze with the vengeful God, Dracula is forced to evade him in order to escape. Agreus taunts the vampire, claiming that he would relish hunting him down but Dracula manages to avoid him long enough to reclaim the fragment from his Owl Familiar. Enraged, Agreus vows to destroy Dracula and challenges him to a final battle. Eventually the two warriors tumble off the edge of the cliff but Dracula uses Agreus to break his fall. With the Old God weakened and unable to fight back, Dracula proceeds to crush Agreus' skull, killing him.\n\nVoiced by Aleksander Mikic.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Castlevania series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Characters In The Castlevania Series}}\n[[Category:Castlevania characters| ]]\n[[Category:Lists of Konami characters|Castlevania]]\n[[Category:Fictional vampire hunters]]\n", "name_user": "Memomick", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDracula", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Castlevania_characters"}

The \"four Doctors\" became a commonplace notion among [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] theologians, and a decree of [[Boniface VIII]] (1298) ordering their feasts to be kept as [[Double feast|doubles]] throughout the Latin Church is contained in his sixth book of Decretals (cap. \"Gloriosus\", de relique. et vener. sanctorum, in Sexto, III, 22).<ref name=\"CathEn\">[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05075a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia article, ''Doctor of the Church'']</ref>\n\nIn the [[Byzantine Church]]{{dn|date=April 2020}}, three Doctors were pre-eminent: [[Saint John Chrysostom]], [[Saint Basil the Great]], and [[Gregory of Nazianzus]]. The feasts of these three saints were made obligatory throughout the Eastern Empire by [[Leo VI the Wise]]. A common feast was later instituted in their honour on 30 January, called \"the feast of the [[three Hierarchs]]\". In the Menaea for that day it is related that the three Doctors appeared in a dream to [[John Mauropous]], Bishop of [[Euchaita]], and commanded him to institute a festival in their honour, in order to put a stop to the rivalries of their votaries and panegyrists. This was under [[Alexius Comnenus]] (1081\u20131118; see \"Acta SS.\", 14 June, under St. Basil, c. xxxviii). But sermons for the feast are attributed in manuscripts to [[Cosmas Vestitor]], who flourished in the tenth century. The three are as common in Eastern art as the four are in Western. [[Guillaume Durand|Durandus]] (i, 3) remarks that Doctors should be represented with books in their hands. In the West analogy led to the veneration of four Eastern Doctors, [[Saint Athanasius]] being added to the three hierarchs.<ref name=\"CathEn\" />\n\n== Catholic Church ==\n[[File:Pier Francesco Sacchi - Dottori della Chiesa - ca. 1516.jpg|thumb|The Four Great Doctors of the Western Church were often depicted in art, here by [[Pier Francesco Sacchi]], c. 1516. From the left: [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]], [[Pope Gregory I]], [[Jerome|Saint Jerome]], and [[Ambrose|Saint Ambrose]], with their [[emblem|attributes]].]]\n\nThe details of the title, ''Doctor of the Church'', vary from one [[Particular church|autonomous ritual church]] to another.\n\n=== Latin Church ===\n\nIn the [[Latin Church]], the four Latin Doctors \"had already long been recognized\" in the [[Latin rite|liturgy]] when the four Great Doctors of the Eastern Church, [[John Chrysostom]], [[Basil the Great]], [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], and [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] were recognized in 1568 by [[Pope Pius V]].\n\nTo these names others have subsequently been added, originally with liturgical effects. The requisite conditions are enumerated as three: ''eminens doctrina'', ''insignis vitae sanctitas'', ''Ecclesiae declaratio'' (i.e. eminent learning, a high degree of sanctity, and proclamation by the Church). [[Benedict XIV]] explains the third as a declaration by the [[supreme pontiff]] or by a [[ecumenical council|general council]]. But though general councils have acclaimed the writings of certain Doctors, no council has actually conferred the title of Doctor of the Church. The procedure involved extending to the universal Church the use of the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] and [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] of the saint in which the title of doctor is applied to him. The decree is issued by the [[Congregation for the Causes of the Saints]] and approved by the pope, after a careful examination, if necessary, of the saint's writings. It is not in any way an ''[[ex cathedra]]'' decision, nor does it even amount to a declaration that no error is to be found in the teaching of the Doctor. It is, indeed, well known that the very greatest of them are not wholly immune from error. No [[martyr]] is in the list, since formerly the Office and the Mass were for [[Confessor of the Faith|Confessors]]. Hence, as Benedict XIV points out, [[Saint Ignatius of Antioch]], [[Irenaeus|Saint Irenaeus of Lyons]], and [[Cyprian|Saint Cyprian of Carthage]] are not called Doctors of the Church.\nThe Doctors' works vary greatly in subject and form. Some, such as Pope Gregory the Great and St Ambrose of Milan, were prominent writers of letters and short treatises. Saints [[Catherine of Siena]] and [[John of the Cross]] wrote [[mystical theology]]. Saints Augustine of Hippo and [[Robert Bellarmine|Bellarmine]] defended the Church against [[heresy]]. [[Bede]] wrote biblical commentaries and theological treatises. Systematic theologians include the Scholastic philosophers [[Anselm of Canterbury|Saint Anselm of Canterbury]], [[Albertus Magnus|Saint Albert the Great]], and [[Thomas Aquinas|Saint Thomas Aquinas]].\n\nUntil 1970, no woman had been named a doctor in the church, but since then four additions to the list have been women: Saints [[Teresa of \u00c1vila]] (St. Teresa of Jesus) and [[Catherine of Siena]] by [[Pope Paul VI]]; [[Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Lisieux]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thereseoflisieux.org/doctor-of-the-universal-church/|title=St. Therese, Doctor of the Universal Church \u2013 Saint Therese of Lisieux|work=thereseoflisieux.org}}</ref> (St. Therese of the Child Jesus and of the Holy Face), \"the Little Flower\" by [[Pope John Paul II]]; and [[Hildegard of Bingen]] by [[Benedict XVI]]. Saints Teresa and Therese were both [[Discalced Carmelite]]s, St. Catherine was a [[Third Order of Saint Dominic|lay Dominican]], and Hildegard was a [[Benedictine]].\n\nTraditionally, in the [[Liturgy]], the Office of Doctors was distinguished from that of [[Confessor of the Faith|Confessors]] by two changes: the Gospel reading ''Vos estis sal terrae'' (\"You are the salt of the earth\"), Matthew 5:13\u201319, and the eighth Respond at Matins, from Ecclesiasticus 15:5, ''In medio Ecclesiae aperuit os ejus, * Et implevit eum Deus spiritu sapientiae et intellectus. * Jucunditatem et exsultationem thesaurizavit super eum.'' (\"In the midst of the Church he opened his mouth, * And God filled him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding. * He heaped upon him a treasure of joy and gladness.\") The [[Nicene Creed]] was also recited at Mass, which is normally not said except on Sundays and the highest-ranking feast days. The 1962 revisions to the Missal dropped the Creed from feasts of Doctors and abolished the title and the Common of [[Confessor of the Faith|Confessors]], instituting a distinct Common of Doctors.\n\n{{As of|2015}}, the Catholic Church has named 36 Doctors of the Church. Of these, the 17 who died before the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] of 1054 are also held in high esteem by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], although it does not use the formal title \"Doctor of the Church\" in the same way that Catholics do.\n\nAmong these 36 are 27 from the West and 9 from the East; 4 women; 18 bishops, 12 priests, 1 deacon, 3 nuns, 1 consecrated virgin; 26 from Europe, 3 from Africa, 7 from Asia. More Doctors (12) lived during the 4th century than any other; eminent Christian writers of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd centuries are usually referred to as the [[Ante-Nicene Fathers]], while the 9th, and 20th centuries have so far produced no Doctors at all. The shortest period between death and nomination was that of [[Alphonsus Liguori]], who died in 1787 and was named a Doctor of the Church in 1871 \u2013 a period of 84 years; the longest was that of [[Ephrem the Syrian]], which took fifteen and a half centuries.\n\nOn 20 August 2011, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] announced that he would soon declare [[John of Avila|St. John of \u00c1vila]] a Doctor of the Church.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pope to proclaim St John of Avila Doctor of the Universal Church|url=http://www.news.va/en/news/pope-proclaims-st-john-of-\u00c1vila-doctor-of-the-univ|work=News.va|publisher=Holy See|accessdate=21 August 2011|date=20 August 2011}}</ref>  Although no official announcement was given, it was reported in December 2011 that Pope Benedict intended to declare [[Hildegard of Bingen]] as a Doctor of the Church despite her not yet having been officially canonized.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pope to Canonize and Name Hildegard of Bingen as Doctor of the Church|url=http://www.romereports.com/palio/pope-to-canonize-and-name-hildegard-of-bingen-as-doctor-of-the-church-english-5666.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107171906/http://www.romereports.com/palio/pope-to-canonize-and-name-hildegard-of-bingen-as-doctor-of-the-church-english-5666.html|archivedate=2012-01-07}}</ref> St. Hildegard of Bingen was officially declared to be a Saint of the universal Church by Pope Benedict XVI on 10 May 2012, clearing the way for her to be named a Doctor of the Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romereports.com/palio/benedict-xvi-officially-declares-hildegard-of-bingen-a-saint-english-6759.html|title=ROME REPORTS TV News Agency|work=www.romereports.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512215802/http://www.romereports.com/palio/benedict-xvi-officially-declares-hildegard-of-bingen-a-saint-english-6759.html|archivedate=2012-05-12}}</ref>  Pope Benedict formally declared St. John of \u00c1vila and Hildegard of Bingen to be Doctors of the Church on 7 October 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.va/en/news/pope-two-new-doctors-of-the-church|title=Pope : Two new Doctors of the Church|work=news.va}}</ref>\n\n[[Pope Francis]] declared the 10th century Armenian monk [[Gregory of Narek|Saint Gregory of Narek]] to be the 36th Doctor of the Church on 21 February 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=San Gregorio di Narek Dottore della Chiesa Universale, 23.02.2015|url=http://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/it/bollettino/pubblico/2015/02/23/0143/00314.html|publisher=Holy See Press Office|language=Italian|date=23 February 2015}}</ref> The decision was somewhat controversial. According to critics of Pope Francis' decision, Saint Gregory was monk of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], which, like other [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]], split off from the rest of Christendom over the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451 AD. Therefore, Saint Gregory is seen by some as a [[Monophysite]] who was in union with neither Catholic or Eastern Orthodox Christians at the time of his death in 1003. The [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches, which the Armenian Church is an integral part of, are [[Miaphysite]]s. Defenders of the decision, however, have cited historical evidence that [[Narekavank|Narek Monastery]], where Saint Gregory lived and died, was a center of opposition to [[Monophysitism]] from inside the Armenian Church. It is also cited that Saint Gregory of Narek is listed in the [[Roman Martyrology]] with a feast day of February 27 and that members of the [[Armenian Catholic Church]] have always had a strong devotion to him and his writings.\n\nIn October 2019, the Polish Catholic Bishops Conference formally petitioned Pope Francis to consider making [[Saint Pope John Paul II]] a Doctor of the Church in an official proclamation, in recognition of his contributions to theology, philosophy, and Catholic literature, as well as the formal documents (encyclicals, apostolic letters, bulls, [[motu proprio]] documents, homilies, and speeches) that he issued.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/polish-bishops-call-for-john-paul-ii-to-be-named-a-doctor-of-the-church-80686 | title=Polish bishops call for John Paul II to be named a doctor of the Church}}</ref> Also, the Archbishop of San Salvador, El Salvador has petitioned Pope Francis to name Saint Archbishop [[Oscar Arnulfo Romero y Galdamez]], martyred in 1980 while he was Archbishop there, who held a doctorate and was a reliably orthodox figure even as he grew to advocate for the plight of his people during the civil war there, as a Doctor of the Church.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.catholicnews.com/services/englishnews/2018/salvadoran-archbishop-asks-pope-to-make-romero-doctor-of-the-church.cfm | title=Salvadoran archbishop asks pope to make Romero 'doctor of the church'}}</ref> Romero and John Paul II are known to be widely respected figures today, even by many in the Eastern Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant denominations, or who are not religious or are agnostic.\n\nIn a departure from previous practice, neither Benedict XVI nor Francis ordered the Doctors of the Church they had created to be inscribed in the [[General Roman Calendar]].\n\n==== List of Doctors ====\n''(For earlier authorities on Christian doctrine, see [[Church Fathers]] and [[Ante-Nicene Fathers]])''\n[[File:Teresa of Avila dsc01644.jpg|thumb|right|[[Teresa of \u00c1vila|St. Teresa of \u00c1vila]] (1515\u20131582) by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] ([[Kunsthistorisches Museum]])]]\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> indicates a saint who died before 1054, and is therefore also held in high esteem by the Eastern Orthodox Church.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

The \"four Doctors\" became a commonplace notion among [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] theologians, and a decree of [[Boniface VIII]] (1298) ordering their feasts to be kept as [[Double feast|doubles]] throughout the Latin Church is contained in his sixth book of Decretals (cap. \"Gloriosus\", de relique. et vener. sanctorum, in Sexto, III, 22).<ref name=\"CathEn\">[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05075a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia article, ''Doctor of the Church'']</ref>\n\nIn the [[Byzantine Church]]{{dn|date=April 2020}}, three Doctors were pre-eminent: [[Saint John Chrysostom]], [[Saint Basil the Great]], and [[Gregory of Nazianzus]]. The feasts of these three saints were made obligatory throughout the Eastern Empire by [[Leo VI the Wise]]. A common feast was later instituted in their honour on 30 January, called \"the feast of the [[three Hierarchs]]\". In the Menaea for that day it is related that the three Doctors appeared in a dream to [[John Mauropous]], Bishop of [[Euchaita]], and commanded him to institute a festival in their honour, in order to put a stop to the rivalries of their votaries and panegyrists. This was under [[Alexius Comnenus]] (1081\u20131118; see \"Acta SS.\", 14 June, under St. Basil, c. xxxviii). But sermons for the feast are attributed in manuscripts to [[Cosmas Vestitor]], who flourished in the tenth century. The three are as common in Eastern art as the four are in Western. [[Guillaume Durand|Durandus]] (i, 3) remarks that Doctors should be represented with books in their hands. In the West analogy led to the veneration of four Eastern Doctors, [[Saint Athanasius]] being added to the three hierarchs.<ref name=\"CathEn\" />\n\n== Catholic Church ==\n[[File:Pier Francesco Sacchi - Dottori della Chiesa - ca. 1516.jpg|thumb|The Four Great Doctors of the Western Church were often depicted in art, here by [[Pier Francesco Sacchi]], c. 1516. From the left: [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]], [[Pope Gregory I]], [[Jerome|Saint Jerome]], and [[Ambrose|Saint Ambrose]], with their [[emblem|attributes]].]]\n\nThe details of the title, ''Doctor of the Church'', vary from one [[Particular church|autonomous ritual church]] to another.\n\n=== Latin Church ===\n\nIn the [[Latin Church]], the four Latin Doctors \"had already long been recognized\" in the [[Latin rite|liturgy]] when the four Great Doctors of the Eastern Church, [[John Chrysostom]], [[Basil the Great]], [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], and [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] were recognized in 1568 by [[Pope Pius V]].\n\nTo these names others have subsequently been added, originally with liturgical effects. The requisite conditions are enumerated as three: ''eminens doctrina'', ''insignis vitae sanctitas'', ''Ecclesiae declaratio'' (i.e. eminent learning, a high degree of sanctity, and proclamation by the Church). [[Benedict XIV]] explains the third as a declaration by the [[supreme pontiff]] or by a [[ecumenical council|general council]]. But though general councils have acclaimed the writings of certain Doctors, no council has actually conferred the title of Doctor of the Church. The procedure involved extending to the universal Church the use of the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] and [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] of the saint in which the title of doctor is applied to him. The decree is issued by the [[Congregation for the Causes of the Saints]] and approved by the pope, after a careful examination, if necessary, of the saint's writings. It is not in any way an ''[[ex cathedra]]'' decision, nor does it even amount to a declaration that no error is to be found in the teaching of the Doctor. It is, indeed, well known that the very greatest of them are not wholly immune from error. No [[martyr]] is in the list, since formerly the Office and the Mass were for [[Confessor of the Faith|Confessors]]. Hence, as Benedict XIV points out, [[Saint Ignatius of Antioch]], [[Irenaeus|Saint Irenaeus of Lyons]], and [[Cyprian|Saint Cyprian of Carthage]] are not called Doctors of the Church.\nThe Doctors' works vary greatly in subject and form. Some, such as Pope Gregory the Great and St Ambrose of Milan, were prominent writers of letters and short treatises. Saints [[Catherine of Siena]] and [[John of the Cross]] wrote [[mystical theology]]. Saints Augustine of Hippo and [[Robert Bellarmine|Bellarmine]] defended the Church against [[heresy]]. [[Bede]] wrote biblical commentaries and theological treatises. Systematic theologians include the Scholastic philosophers [[Anselm of Canterbury|Saint Anselm of Canterbury]], [[Albertus Magnus|Saint Albert the Great]], and [[Thomas Aquinas|Saint Thomas Aquinas]].\n\nUntil 1970, no woman had been named a doctor in the church, but since then four additions to the list have been women: Saints [[Teresa of \u00c1vila]] (St. Teresa of Jesus) and [[Catherine of Siena]] by [[Pope Paul VI]]; [[Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Lisieux]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thereseoflisieux.org/doctor-of-the-universal-church/|title=St. Therese, Doctor of the Universal Church \u2013 Saint Therese of Lisieux|work=thereseoflisieux.org}}</ref> (St. Therese of the Child Jesus and of the Holy Face), \"the Little Flower\" by [[Pope John Paul II]]; and [[Hildegard of Bingen]] by [[Benedict XVI]]. Saints Teresa and Therese were both [[Discalced Carmelite]]s, St. Catherine was a [[Third Order of Saint Dominic|lay Dominican]], and Hildegard was a [[Benedictine]].\n\nTraditionally, in the [[Liturgy]], the Office of Doctors was distinguished from that of [[Confessor of the Faith|Confessors]] by two changes: the Gospel reading ''Vos estis sal terrae'' (\"You are the salt of the earth\"), Matthew 5:13\u201319, and the eighth Respond at Matins, from Ecclesiasticus 15:5, ''In medio Ecclesiae aperuit os ejus, * Et implevit eum Deus spiritu sapientiae et intellectus. * Jucunditatem et exsultationem thesaurizavit super eum.'' (\"In the midst of the Church he opened his mouth, * And God filled him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding. * He heaped upon him a treasure of joy and gladness.\") The [[Nicene Creed]] was also recited at Mass, which is normally not said except on Sundays and the highest-ranking feast days. The 1962 revisions to the Missal dropped the Creed from feasts of Doctors and abolished the title and the Common of [[Confessor of the Faith|Confessors]], instituting a distinct Common of Doctors.\n\n{{As of|2015}}, the Catholic Church has named 36 Doctors of the Church. Of these, the 17 who died before the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] of 1054 are also held in high esteem by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], although it does not use the formal title \"Doctor of the Church\" in the same way that Catholics do.\n\nAmong these 36 are 27 from the West and 9 from the East; 4 women; 18 bishops, 12 priests, 1 deacon, 3 nuns, 1 consecrated virgin; 26 from Europe, 3 from Africa, 7 from Asia. More Doctors (12) lived during the 4th century than any other; eminent Christian writers of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd centuries are usually referred to as the [[Ante-Nicene Fathers]], while the 9th, and 20th centuries have so far produced no Doctors at all. The shortest period between death and nomination was that of [[Alphonsus Liguori]], who died in 1787 and was named a Doctor of the Church in 1871 \u2013 a period of 84 years; the longest was that of [[Ephrem the Syrian]], which took fifteen and a half centuries.\n\nOn 20 August 2011, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] announced that he would soon declare [[John of Avila|St. John of \u00c1vila]] a Doctor of the Church.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pope to proclaim St John of Avila Doctor of the Universal Church|url=http://www.news.va/en/news/pope-proclaims-st-john-of-\u00c1vila-doctor-of-the-univ|work=News.va|publisher=Holy See|accessdate=21 August 2011|date=20 August 2011}}</ref>  Although no official announcement was given, it was reported in December 2011 that Pope Benedict intended to declare [[Hildegard of Bingen]] as a Doctor of the Church despite her not yet having been officially canonized.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pope to Canonize and Name Hildegard of Bingen as Doctor of the Church|url=http://www.romereports.com/palio/pope-to-canonize-and-name-hildegard-of-bingen-as-doctor-of-the-church-english-5666.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107171906/http://www.romereports.com/palio/pope-to-canonize-and-name-hildegard-of-bingen-as-doctor-of-the-church-english-5666.html|archivedate=2012-01-07}}</ref> St. Hildegard of Bingen was officially declared to be a Saint of the universal Church by Pope Benedict XVI on 10 May 2012, clearing the way for her to be named a Doctor of the Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romereports.com/palio/benedict-xvi-officially-declares-hildegard-of-bingen-a-saint-english-6759.html|title=ROME REPORTS TV News Agency|work=www.romereports.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512215802/http://www.romereports.com/palio/benedict-xvi-officially-declares-hildegard-of-bingen-a-saint-english-6759.html|archivedate=2012-05-12}}</ref>  Pope Benedict formally declared St. John of \u00c1vila and Hildegard of Bingen to be Doctors of the Church on 7 October 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.va/en/news/pope-two-new-doctors-of-the-church|title=Pope : Two new Doctors of the Church|work=news.va}}</ref>\n\n[[Pope Francis]] declared the 10th century Armenian monk [[Gregory of Narek|Saint Gregory of Narek]] to be the 36th Doctor of the Church on 21 February 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=San Gregorio di Narek Dottore della Chiesa Universale, 23.02.2015|url=http://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/it/bollettino/pubblico/2015/02/23/0143/00314.html|publisher=Holy See Press Office|language=Italian|date=23 February 2015}}</ref> The decision was somewhat controversial. According to critics of Pope Francis' decision, Saint Gregory was monk of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], which, like other [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]], split off from the rest of Christendom over the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451 AD. Therefore, Saint Gregory is seen by some as a [[Monophysite]] who was in union with neither Catholic or Eastern Orthodox Christians at the time of his death in 1003. The [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches, which the Armenian Church is an integral part of, are [[Miaphysite]]s. Defenders of the decision, however, have cited historical evidence that [[Narekavank|Narek Monastery]], where Saint Gregory lived and died, was a center of opposition to [[Monophysitism]] from inside the Armenian Church. It is also cited that Saint Gregory of Narek is listed in the [[Roman Martyrology]] with a feast day of February 27 and that members of the [[Armenian Catholic Church]] have always had a strong devotion to him and his writings.\n\nIn October 2019, the Polish Catholic Bishops Conference formally petitioned Pope Francis to consider making [[Saint Pope John Paul II]] a Doctor of the Church in an official proclamation, in recognition of his contributions to theology, philosophy, and Catholic literature, as well as the formal documents (encyclicals, apostolic letters, bulls, [[motu proprio]] documents, homilies, and speeches) that he issued.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/polish-bishops-call-for-john-paul-ii-to-be-named-a-doctor-of-the-church-80686 | title=Polish bishops call for John Paul II to be named a doctor of the Church}}</ref> Also, the Archbishop of San Salvador, El Salvador has petitioned Pope Francis to name Saint Archbishop [[Oscar Arnulfo Romero y Galdamez]], martyred in 1980 while he was Archbishop there, who held a doctorate and was a reliably orthodox figure even as he grew to advocate for the plight of his people during the civil war there, as a Doctor of the Church.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.catholicnews.com/services/englishnews/2018/salvadoran-archbishop-asks-pope-to-make-romero-doctor-of-the-church.cfm | title=Salvadoran archbishop asks pope to make Romero 'doctor of the church'}}</ref> Romero and John Paul II are known to be widely respected figures today, even by many in the Eastern Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant denominations, or who are not religious or are agnostic.\n\nIn a departure from previous practice, neither Benedict XVI nor Francis ordered the Doctors of the Church they had created to be inscribed in the [[General Roman Calendar]].\n\n==== List of Doctors ====\n''(For earlier authorities on Christian doctrine, see [[Church Fathers]] and [[Ante-Nicene Fathers]])''\n[[File:Teresa of Avila dsc01644.jpg|thumb|right|[[Teresa of \u00c1vila|St. Teresa of \u00c1vila]] (1515\u20131582) by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] ([[Kunsthistorisches Museum]])]]\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> indicates a saint who died before 1054, and is therefore also held in high esteem by the Eastern Orthodox Church.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

The [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] version of this suggests that there were in fact 70 sons of the Most High God sent to rule over the 70 nations of the Earth. This idea of the 70 nations of Earth, each ruled over by one of the Elohim (sons of God), is also found in Ugaritic texts. The [[Arslan Tash]] inscription suggests that each of the 70 sons of El Elyon was bound to their people by a covenant.

The marriage of the deity with the city seems to have biblical parallels with the stories that link [[Melkart]] with [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], [[Yahweh (Canaanite deity)|Yahweh]] with [[Jerusalem]], and [[Tanit]] and [[Baal Hammon]] with [[Carthage]]. [[El Elyon]] is mentioned (as ''God Most High'') in Genesis 14.18\u201319 as the God whose priest was [[Melchizedek]], king of Salem.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nPhilo states that the union of El Elyon and his consort resulted in the birth of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] and [[Gaia (mythology)|Ge]] (Greek names for ''Heaven'' and ''Earth''). This closely parallels the opening verse of the Hebrew Bible, [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:1\u2014\"In the beginning God ([[Elohim]]) created the [[Heaven]]s (''[[Shemayim]]'') and the Earth\" (''Eretz''). It also parallels the story of the Babylonian [[Anunaki]] gods.\n\n==Abrahamic religions==\n{{Further|Panbabylonism}}\nThe ''[[Enuma Elish]]'' has been compared to the [[Genesis creation narrative]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crivoice.org/enumaelish.html |title=The Enuma Elish: The Babylonian Creation Myth |publisher=Crivoice.org |date=2011-11-11 |accessdate=2011-12-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stenudd.com/myth/enumaelish/enumaelish-4.htm |title=ENUMA ELISH - Babylonian Creation Myth - Theories |publisher=Stenudd.com |accessdate=2011-12-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122033206/http://stenudd.com/myth/enumaelish/enumaelish-4.htm |archivedate=22 November 2011 }}</ref><ref>Sharpes, Donald K.

The [[Masoretic Text]]s suggest:\n\n<blockquote>When the Most High ('Ely\u014dn) divided to the nations their inheritance, he separated the sons of man (\u0100d\u0101m); he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the sons of Israel.</blockquote>\n\nRather than \"sons of [[Israel]]\", the [[Septuagint]], the Greek Old Testament, suggests the \"angel\u014dn theou,\" or \"angels of God\", and a few versions even have ''hui\u014dn theou'' ([[sons of God]]). The [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] version of this suggests that there were in fact 70 sons of the Most High God sent to rule over the 70 nations of the Earth. This idea of the 70 nations of Earth, each ruled over by one of the Elohim (sons of God), is also found in Ugaritic texts. The [[Arslan Tash]] inscription suggests that each of the 70 sons of El Elyon was bound to their people by a covenant. Thus, Crossan{{Who|date=May 2016}} translates:\n\n<blockquote><poem>The Eternal One ('Olam) has made a covenant oath with us,\nAsherah has made (a pact) with us.\nAnd all the sons of El,\nAnd the great council of all the Holy Ones ([[Qetesh|Qedesh]]).\nWith oaths of Heaven and Ancient Earth.</poem></blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mythology|Asia}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ancient Egyptian religion]]\n* [[Arabian mythology]]\n* [[History of Judaism]]\n* ''[[Moses and Monotheism]]''\n* [[Names of God in Judaism]]\n* [[Origins of Judaism]]\n* [[Prehistoric religion]]\n* [[Religions of the ancient Near East]]\n* [[Semitic Neopaganism]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Donald A.

Further outside but more difficult to calculate, [[David Neville (athlete)|David Neville]] was also out fast, while Merritt was even relative to the stagger against [[Chris Brown (athlete)|Chris Brown]] in lanes 4 and 5.  Around the final turn Merritt separated from the others and the three Americans were ahead, with Neville in first as the turn was ending.  Once they hit the straightaway, it was Merritt who had the speed, sprinting away with a high knee action that increased his gap over Wariner and Neville.  Wariner had no answer, Neville looked depleted, while Brown was steadily gaining.  Merritt sped away to a personal best 43.75, Wariner gave up the chase and jogged across the finish line in second, barely ahead of Brown, who looked like he had passed Neville.  In the last two steps, Neville fell right at the finish line, his hands technically crossing the line ahead of Wariner.  But it is the torso that counts and Neville's body crossed the line in third, .04 ahead of Brown and .06 behind Wariner.  Merritt had gained just shy of a full second on Wariner over the last 90 metres for the win.  Neville completed an American [[List of medal sweeps in Olympic athletics|sweep]] of the event.<ref>Ramsak, Bob (2008-08-21).

Further outside but more difficult to calculate, [[David Neville (athlete)|David Neville]] was also out fast, while Merritt was even relative to the stagger against [[Chris Brown (athlete)|Chris Brown]] in lanes 4 and 5.  Around the final turn Merritt separated from the others and the three Americans were ahead, with Neville in first as the turn was ending.  Once they hit the straightaway, it was Merritt who had the speed, sprinting away with a high knee action that increased his gap over Wariner and Neville.  Wariner had no answer, Neville looked depleted, while Brown was steadily gaining.  Merritt sped away to a personal best 43.75, Wariner gave up the chase and jogged across the finish line in second, barely ahead of Brown, who looked like he had passed Neville.  In the last two steps, Neville desperately leaned into a headlong dive across the finish line, his hands technically crossing the line ahead of Wariner.  But it is the torso that counts and Neville's body crossed the line in third, .04 ahead of Brown and .06 behind Wariner.  Merritt had gained just shy of a full second on Wariner over the last 90 metres for the win.  Neville completed an American [[List of medal sweeps in Olympic athletics|sweep]] of the event.<ref>Ramsak, Bob (2008-08-21).

Some bigamy statutes are broad enough to potentially encompass polyamorous relationships involving [[cohabitation]], even if none of the participants claim marriage to more than one partner.\n\nIn most countries, it is legal for three or more people to form and share a sexual relationship (subject sometimes to laws against [[homosexuality]] or [[adultery]] if two of the three are married). With only minor exceptions no developed countries permit ''marriage'' among more than two people, nor do the majority of countries give legal protection (e.g., of rights relating to children) to non-married partners. Individuals involved in polyamorous relationships are generally considered by the law to be no different from people who live together, or \"[[Dating|date]]\", under other circumstances.

Accordingly, they include parallel entitlements, obligations, and limitations. Among the latter, as in the case of the New Zealand Civil Union Act 2005, there are parallel prohibitions on civil unions with more than one partner, which is considered bigamy, or dual marriage/civil union hybrids with more than one person. Both are banned under Sections 205\u2013206 of the Crimes Act 1961. In jurisdictions where [[same-sex marriage]] proper exists, bigamous same-sex marriages fall under the same set of legal prohibitions as bigamous heterosexual marriages. As yet, there is no case law applicable to these issues.<ref>Andrew Webb ''et al.''

In jurisdictions where civil unions or registered partnerships are recognized, the same principle applies to divorce in those contexts.

Unequal power dynamics, such as financial dependence, can also inappropriately influence a person to agree to a polyamorous relationship against their true desires.   Even in more equal power dynamic relationships, the reluctant partner may feel coerced into a proposed non-monogamous arrangement due to the implication that if they refuse, the proposer will pursue other partners anyway, will break off the relationship, or that the one refusing will be accused of intolerance.<ref name=\"Sizemore\">{{cite journal | last=Sizemore | first=Kayla M. | last2=Olmstead | first2=Spencer B. | title=Willingness of Emerging Adults to Engage in Consensual Non-Monogamy: A Mixed-Methods Analysis | journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume=47 | issue=5 | date=2017-10-06 | issn=0004-0002 | doi=10.1007/s10508-017-1075-5 | pmid=28986760 | pages=1423\u20131438 | quote=   The final reason given by those in the 'Willing' group was that their engagement in CNM would be a sacrifice for their partner or for their relationship.

Some bigamy statutes are broad enough to potentially encompass polyamorous relationships involving [[cohabitation]], even if none of the participants claim marriage to more than one partner.\n\nIn most countries, it is legal for three or more people to form and share a sexual relationship (subject sometimes to laws against [[homosexuality]] or [[adultery]] if two of the three are married). With only minor exceptions no developed countries permit ''marriage'' among more than two people, nor do the majority of countries give legal protection (e.g., of rights relating to children) to non-married partners.

Accordingly, they include parallel entitlements, obligations, and limitations. Among the latter, as in the case of the New Zealand Civil Union Act 2005, there are parallel prohibitions on civil unions with more than one partner, which is considered bigamy, or dual marriage/civil union hybrids with more than one person. Both are banned under Sections 205\u2013206 of the Crimes Act 1961. In jurisdictions where [[same-sex marriage]] proper exists, bigamous same-sex marriages fall under the same set of legal prohibitions as bigamous heterosexual marriages.

Unequal power dynamics, such as financial dependence, can also inappropriately influence a person to agree to a polyamorous relationship against their true desires.   Even in more equal power dynamic relationships, the reluctant partner may feel coerced into a proposed non-monogamous arrangement due to the implication that if they refuse, the proposer will pursue other partners anyway, will break off the relationship, or that the one refusing will be accused of intolerance.<ref name=\"Sizemore\">{{cite journal | last=Sizemore | first=Kayla M. | last2=Olmstead | first2=Spencer B. | title=Willingness of Emerging Adults to Engage in Consensual Non-Monogamy: A Mixed-Methods Analysis | journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume=47 | issue=5 | date=2017-10-06 | issn=0004-0002 | doi=10.1007/s10508-017-1075-5 | pmid=28986760 | pages=1423\u20131438 | quote=   The final reason given by those in the 'Willing' group was that their engagement in CNM would be a sacrifice for their partner or for their relationship.

The road connects Tennessee's three largest cities\u2014[[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], and [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]\u2014and crosses all of Tennessee's physiographical provinces and [[Grand Divisions of Tennessee|Grand Divisions]]\u2014the [[Mississippi Embayment]] and [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] in [[West Tennessee]], the [[Highland Rim]] and [[Nashville Basin]] in [[Middle Tennessee]], and the [[Cumberland Plateau]], [[Appalachian Valley and Ridge Province]], and [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge Province]] in [[East Tennessee]]. The Tennessee section of I-40 is {{convert|452|mi|km}} long, the longest of any state on the route.\n\n==Route description==\n\n===West Tennessee===\n====Memphis====\n[[File:Hernando de Soto Bridge Memphis.jpg|thumb|left|The Hernando de Soto Bridge, where I-40 crosses the [[Mississippi River]] into [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]]]\n\nI-40 enters Tennessee via the six lane [[Hernando de Soto Bridge]], which spans the Mississippi River at river mile 736. Immediately within the city of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], the interstate passes across the southern half of [[Mud Island, Memphis|Mud Island]] before crossing the [[Wolf River (Tennessee)|Wolf River Harbor]] into downtown Memphis. Throughout Memphis, the highway contains a minimum of six through lanes, except through major interchanges. Upon reaching Memphis, I-40 immediately has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 51 in Tennessee|U.S. Route&nbsp;51]] (US&nbsp;51), and {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} from the state line is an interchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate 240 (Tennessee)|I-240]], where I-40 abruptly turns north, following a route formerly designated as part of I-240. (For the next {{convert|10|mi|km|disp=sqbr}}, this segment is designated as the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Expressway.) About one mile later, I-40 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 14|State Route 14]] (SR&nbsp;14, Jackson Avenue), and about {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond this point, the highway crosses the Wolf River again and has an interchange with the eastern terminus of [[Tennessee State Route 300|SR&nbsp;300]], a controlled-access connector to US&nbsp;51. At this interchange, the Interstate turns sharp east. Passing first near the neighborhoods of [[Frayser, Memphis|Frayser]] and [[Raleigh, Memphis|Raleigh]], about {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} later, I-40 crosses the Wolf River for a third time as the highway turns southeast, and has an interchange with SR&nbsp;14 again. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 204|SR&nbsp;204]] (Covington Pike), and {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond this point, I-40 comes to a complicated interchange with [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;64]]/[[U.S. Route 70 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;70]]/[[U.S. Route 79 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;79]], I-240 southbound and Sam Cooper Boulevard eastbound, and turns sharp northeast, leaving Memphis. For the next several miles the highway is known as the Isaac Hayes Memorial Highway and is eight lanes, the left lanes functioning as [[HOV lane]]s during [[rush hour]], passing through several major suburbs of Memphis, including [[Bartlett, Tennessee|Bartlett]], [[Cordova, Tennessee|Cordova]], and [[Lakeland, Tennessee|Lakeland]]. At exit 18, which is US&nbsp;64, the highway narrows to six lanes, and to four lanes a short distance beyond. Several miles later, near [[Arlington, Tennessee|Arlington]], at exit 24, is a [[cloverleaf interchange]] with [[Interstate 269|I-269]]/[[Tennessee State Route 385|SR&nbsp;385]].\n\n====Gulf coastal plain====\n\nAbout one mile east of Arlington, I-40 enters [[Fayette County, Tennessee|Fayette County]], and about another mile later crosses the [[Loosahatchie River]] and leaves the Memphis area, traversing through the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] in a very flat and straight stretch of mostly farmland with some rural woodlands, bypassing most cities and communities. At exit 35 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 59|SR 59]], which connects to [[Covington, Tennessee|Covington]] and  [[Somerville, Tennessee|Somerville]]. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Haywood County, Tennessee|Haywood County]], and about {{convert|10|mi|km}} later, the highway turns north and enters the [[Hatchie National Wildlife Refuge]] and crosses the [[Hatchie River]]. Upon exiting the refuge about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later, I-40 turns east and passes just southeast of Brownsville, where it has an interchange first with [[Tennessee State Route 76|SR 76]], which also connects to Somerville. Eight miles later is an interchange with US 70, and {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Madison County, Tennessee|Madison County]]. Entering [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], at mile marker 78, the crosses the [[South Fork of the Forked Deer River|South Fork]] of the [[Forked Deer River]]. Passing through the northern half of the city, I-40 has a total of six exits in Jackson. First, at mile 79, is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 412 in Tennessee|US 412]] (which connects to [[Alamo, Tennessee|Alamo]] and [[Dyersburg, Tennessee|Dyersburg]]), then about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later an interchange with the [[Tennessee State Route 186#U.S. Route 45 Bypass|US 45 Bypass]]. About {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 45|US 45]], which also connects to [[Humboldt, Tennessee|Humboldt]] and [[Milan, Tennessee|Milan]], and about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US 70, which also connects to Huntington, Tennessee|Huntington]], and I-40 leaves Jackson at this point. From this point, I-40 continues east northeast through a sparsely populated area of farmland and woodlands, and about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later enters [[Henderson County, Tennessee|Henderson County]]. About {{convert|15|mi|km}} later, near the community of [[Parkers Crossroads, Tennessee|Parkers Crossroads]], I-40 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 22|SR 22]], a major north-south connector route in west Tennessee, which, at this interchange, is signed as a connector to [[Lexington, Tennessee|Lexington]] and Huntington. A few miles later, I-40 crosses the [[Big Sandy River (Tennessee)|Big Sandy River]] before proceeding through the northern half of the [[Natchez Trace State Park]], and around milepost 120 enters [[Decatur County, Tennessee|Decatur County]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 641|US 641]]/[[Tennessee State Route 69|SR 69]], another major north-south corridor, which at this point connects to [[Camden, Tennessee|Camden]] and [[Decaturville, Tennessee|Decaturville]]. I-40 then enters [[Benton County, Tennessee|Benton County]], and about {{convert|6|mi|km}} later,   descends about {{convert|400|ft|m}} on a steep grade over the course of a mile, the westbound lanes gaining a [[truck climbing lane]], before crossing the [[Tennessee River]] into [[Middle Tennessee]] on the {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} [[Jimmy Mann Evans Memorial Bridge]]. This river crossing is also located within the [[Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge]].\n\n===Middle Tennessee===\n====Western highland rim====\n\nUpon crossing the Tennessee River into [[Humphreys County, Tennessee|Humphreys County]], I-40 traverses through mostly vast woodlands in the rugged hills of the Western [[Highland Rim]] for a considerable distance. This section is characterized by several noticeable upgrades and downgrades, with mostly minor curves. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} beyond the Tennessee River is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 13|SR 13]], which connects to [[Linden, Tennessee|Linden]] and [[Waverly, Tennessee|Waverly]]. About {{convert|5|mi|km}} later, I-40 crosses into [[Hickman County, Tennessee|Hickman County]] and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 50|SR 50]], which connects to [[Centerville, Tennessee|Centerville]]. I-40 then crosses the [[Duck River (Tennessee)|Duck River]], traveling through mostly wooded areas characterized by further rugged terrain, and at mile 163 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 48|SR 48]], the first exit for [[Dickson, Tennessee|Dickson]]. I-40 then enters [[Dickson County, Tennessee|Dickson County]], and shortly beyond this point crosses the [[Piney River (Middle Tennessee)|Piney River]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 46|SR 46]], the second Dickson exit which also connects to Centerville and [[Columbia, Tennessee|Columbia]]. Approaching the urban parts of the [[Nashville metropolitan area]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} later is the western terminus of [[Interstate 840 (Tennessee)|Interstate 840]], the outer southern beltway around Nashville. The highway continues through mostly woodlands and rugged terrain, and crossing into [[Williamson County, Tennessee|Williamson County]], I-40 briefly enters a steep ascent, gaining a truck climbing lane on the eastbound side, and {{convert|6|mi|km}} beyond I-840 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 96|SR 96]], which connects to the Nashville suburbs of [[Fairview, Tennessee|Fairview]] and [[Franklin, Tennessee|Franklin]]. A few miles later, I-40 enters [[Cheatham County, Tennessee|Cheatham County]], and descends into the [[Nashville Basin]] between mile markers 186 and 188, and still in a predominantly rural area, has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 248|SR 248]] in [[Kingston Springs, Tennessee|Kingston Springs]]. I-40 the crosses the [[Harpeth River]] twice over a distsnce of about {{convert|1|mi|km}}.\n\n====Nashville====\n[[File:Destinations from Interstate 40-65 (Exit 209, 209A, 209B) in Nashville.JPG|thumb|right|Destination sign for exit 209/209A/209B in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]]]\nAround milepost 191, I-40 enters [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]], and a few miles later crosses the Harpeth River for a third time. About a mile later, near\n[[Bellevue, Tennessee|Bellevue]], I-40 widens to six lanes, entering the urban outskirts of Nashville, and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 70S|US 70S]]. Three miles later is an exit with [[Tennessee State Route 251|SR 251]] ([[Old Hickory Boulevard]]), and {{convert|2|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US 70. Widening to eight lanes, three miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 155|SR 155]] (Briley Pkwy, White Bridge Road), including the western terminus of the northern controlled-access beltway around Nashville. About two miles later is the western terminus of [[Interstate 440 (Tennessee)|I-440]], the southern loop around central Nashville. Two miles later, I-40 enters [[Downtown Nashville]], and begins a brief concurrency with [[Interstate 65 in Tennessee|I-65]], turning southeast. As part of the route around downtown Nashville known locally as the Downtown Loop, the two concurrent routs have interchanges with US 70 (Charlotte Avenue) and US 70S/[[U.S. Route 431 in Tennessee|431]] (Broadway), as well as two surface streets, Church Street and Demonbreun Street. About two miles later the two concurrent routes turn east northeast, and I-65 splits off and heads south. Briefly on its own for about {{convert|1|mi|km}}, I-40 crosses a long viaduct, and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 31A|US 31A]]/[[U.S. Route 41 Alternate (Monteagle, Tennessee\u2013Hopkinsville, Kentucky)|41A]] (4th Avenue, 2nd Avenue), before beginning a brief concurrency with [[Interstate 24#Tennessee|I-24]] and turning southeast. About {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, I-24 splits off, and I-40 turns east. The eastern terminus of I-440 is also directly accessible from the east bound lanes of I-40 at this interchange, and [[U.S. Route 41 in Tennessee|US 41]], which crosses I-24 before this interchange, is also directly accessible from I-40 at this interchange.\n[[File:Interstate 40 @ Beckwith.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 near Mount Juliet, east of Nashville.]]\nAbout {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later, I-40 has an interchange with SR 155 (Briley Parkway) near the [[Nashville International Airport]], and about a mile later, the eastbound lanes have a direct access partial-y exit to a surface road to the airport. The westbound lanes of I-40 are only accessible from this interchange. Less than a half mile later is an exit with [[Tennessee State Route 255|SR 255]] (Donelson Pike), and beginning here, the left lanes of I-40 function as HOV lanes during rush hour. Passing near [[J. Percy Priest Dam]], I-40 has an interchange with Stewarts Ferry Pike, then crosses the [[Stones River]], and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 45|SR 45]] (Old Hickory Boulevard). Also at this interchange is a separate partial y interchange which provides access to SR 45 via a bypass which junctions with SR 45 about {{convert|3/4|mi|km}} north of I-40. This bypass is only accessible via the eastbound lanes of I-40, and the westbound lanes are only accessible from it. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Wilson County, Tennessee|Wilson County]], and few miles later has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 171|SR 171]] near the Nashville suburb of [[Mount Juliet, Tennessee|Mount Juliet]]. Six miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 109|SR 109]], which connects to [[Gallatin, Tennessee|Gallatin]].  About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later and about {{convert|25|mi|km}} east of Nashville, the route narrows back to four lanes and has an interchange with the eastern terminus of I-840 a few miles east of [[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon]]. I-40 the enters Lebanon and has interchanges with [[U.S. Route 231|US 231]] and US 70.\n\n====Western Highland Rim and Cumberland Plateau====\nFor the next roughly {{convert|50|mi|km}}, I-40 continues across mostly open farmland, passing near mostly small communities. About {{convert|10|mi|km}} east of Lebanon, I-40 enters [[Smith County, Tennessee|Smith County]], and less than {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later I-40 begins a steep ascent where the eastbound lanes gain a truck climbing lane. This lane terminates about {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} later, and about {{convert|5.5|mi|km}} beyond this point is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 53|SR 53]] near [[Carthage, Tennessee|Carthage]] and [[Gordonsville, Tennessee|Gordonsville]]. Between mileposts 263 and 266, I-40 crosses the meandering [[Caney Fork River]] five times before crossing into [[Putnam County, Tennessee|Putnam County]] and beginning its ascent out of the [[Eastern Highland Rim]] onto the [[Cumberland Plateau]]. At milepost 268, I-40 has an interchange once again with SR 96, and a few miles later reaches an elevation of {{convert|1000|ft|m}} for the first time in the state near [[Silver Point, Tennessee|Silver Point]], and beginning at the edge of the table-top rim at mile marker 272 near [[Baxter, Tennessee|Baxter]], the interstate remains relatively flat across the plateau. I-40 then immediately has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 56|SR 56]] southbound/[[Tennessee State Route 141|SR 141]], which connect to [[Smithville, Tennessee|Smithville]] and [[McMinnville, Tennessee|McMinnville]]. Beginning a concurrency with SR 56 at this point, the latter route splits off {{convert|7|mi|km}} later, heading north towards [[Gainesboro, Tennessee|Gainesboro]]. Reaching [[Cookeville, Tennessee|Cookeville]] about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later, I-40 has a total of five interchanges,\nincluding with [[Tennessee State Route 111|SR 111]], a major north-south connector to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and US [[U.S. Route 70N|70N]]. Beginning a few miles beyond this point, I-40 begins another steep uphill ascent, protracted over a distance of about {{convert|5|mi}}, reaching an elevation of nearly {{convert|2,000|ft|m}}. Through this section, the speed limit reduces to 65 mph, and 55 mph for trucks on the westbound descent. Continuing through a predominantly wooded area, continues for about {{convert|10|mi|km}} through a predominantly wooded area, before reaching [[Monterey, Tennessee|Monterey]] a few miles later, where the route has two interchanges with US 70N, which contain concurrencies with [[Tennessee State Route 84|SR 84]] and [[Tennessee State Route 62|SR 62]], respectively. A short distance later, I-40 reaches an elevation of over {{convert|2,000|ft|m}} for the first time in Tennessee, before crossing into [[Cumberland County, Tennessee|Cumberland County]] and [[East Tennessee]] about {{convert|1/4|mi|km}}.\n\n===East Tennessee===\n\n====Cumberland Plateau and Tennessee Valley====\n[[File:Cumberland-plateau-i40-tn1.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 descending [[Walden Ridge]], miles 341\u2013346]]\n\nAfter ascending further up into the Walden Ridge/Cumberland Plateau and passing through Monterey, I-40 remains relatively flat and straight as it continues across the Cumberland Plateau. At mile 308, I-40 crosses the [[Tennessee Divide]], where the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] and [[Tennessee River]] watersheds meet. The divide is marked in the eastbound lanes with a sign reading \"Entering [[Emory River]] watershed.\" In the westbound counterparts is a sign noting the beginning of the Caney Fork watershed. About ten miles later, I-40 reaches [[Crossville, Tennessee|Crossville]], and has three interchanges, including one  with [[U.S. Route 127 in Tennessee|US 127]], which also conbects to [[Jamestown, Tennessee|Jamestown]]. \nEast of Crossville, the [[Crab Orchard Mountains]], the southern fringe of the [[Cumberland Mountains]], come into view as the road descends several hundred feet. At mile 329, the interstate enters Crab Orchard Gap and proceeds through a narrow valley once prone to [[landslide|rockslide]]s. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-40 gas an interchange with US 70 near the town of [[Crab Orchard, Tennessee|Crab Orchard]]. At mile 340, the Interstate crosses into [[Roane County, Tennessee|Roane County]] entering the [[Eastern Time Zone]], and shortly thereafter the road begins its descent of the Cumberland Plateau into the [[Tennessee Valley]] and the speed limit is 60&nbsp;mph to 70&nbsp;mph. I-40 hugs the slopes of the plateau's [[Walden Ridge]] escarpment for several miles, containing what some describe as dramatic views of the Tennessee Valley below to the south, before reaching the base of the plateau at mile 347 between [[Harriman, Tennessee|Harriman]] and [[Rockwood, Tennessee|Rockwood]], and containing an interchange with [[U.S. Route 27 in Tennessee|US 27]]. As it enters the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians|Ridge-and-Valley]] province of the Appalachians, of which the Tennessee Valley is a part, I-40 crosses a series of ridges and valleys characteristic of the region's topography. About {{convert|4|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 29|SR 29]], and about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, the road crosses the Clinch River, with the [[Kingston Fossil Plant]] and its {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} twin smokestacks dominating the view to the north. About {{convert|1|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 58|SR 58]] southbound in [[Kingston, Tennessee|Kingston]], and at this point, I-40 begins a brief concurrency with SR 58. After ascending a short and relatively steep ridge out of the Clinch River Valley, SR 58 splits off to the north about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later, heading towards [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]]. Continuing through the relatively rugged terrain of the Great Appalachian Valley and crossing additional ridges, I-40 crosses into [[Loudon County, Tennessee|Loudon County]] about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 321|US 321]]/[[Tennessee State Route 95|SR 95]] near Lenoir city, before reaching I-75 about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later.\n\n====Knoxville====\n{{See also|Interstate 75 in Tennessee#Knoxville}}\nAt exit 368, about 20 miles west southwest of downtown Knoxville, I-40 merges with [[Interstate 75 in Tennessee|I-75]], which continues to the southwest to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and the two routes turn east northeast, carrying six through lanes, and cross into [[Knox County, Tennessee|Knox County]] a short distance later. Throughout this concurrency, exits are numbered according to I-40 mileage. The two highways pass through several of the western suburbs of Knoxville,  including [[Farragut, Tennessee|Farragut]], and have interchanges with a few surface streets. At exit 374 ([[Tennessee State Route 131|SR 131]]/Lovell Road), the highway widens to eight lanes and at the next exit, about {{convert|1.25|mi|km}} later, is an interchange with the [[Pellissippi Parkway]] (SR 162 westbound, I-140 eastbound), which connects to Oak Ridge and [[Maryville, Tennessee|Maryville]], respectively. Continuing through western Knoxville, the two rputes have interchanges with additional surface streets, before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11 in Tennessee|US 11]]/70 {{convert|4|mi|km}} later near the [[West Hills, Knoxville|West Hills]] neighborhood. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 332|SR 332]] (Northshore Drive), and the separate Papermill Drive and Weisgarber Road. Two miles later, at exit 385, is an interchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate 640|I-640]], a beltway which passes northwest of downtown Knoxville. Also at this exit, I-75 splits off from I-40 onto a concurrency with I-640, splitting off a few miles later and heading towards [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. The route then enters downtown Knoxville, containing a minimum of six through lanes through the entirety of central Knoxville, as well as several short segments of [[auxiliary lane]]s between exits. Passing near the main campus of the [[University of Tennessee]], as well as several residential neighborhoods, about \n{{convert|1.5|mi|km}} past I-640 is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 129 in Tennessee|US 129]], which connects to [[McGhee Tyson Airport]] and is a route to the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]. One mile later is an interchange with SR 62 (Western Avenue), and a mile beyond this point is an interchange with [[Interstate 275 (Tennessee)|I-275]]. About {{convert|1/4|mi|km}} later, in a complicated interchange, I-40 has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 441 in Tennessee|US 441]] south (Henley Street), and begins a brief concurrency with this route, which splits off about {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later, along with [[Tennessee State Route 158|SR 158]] westbound, as controlled-access [[James White Parkway]]. I-40 then curves sharp north, and about {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later, sharp east again before coming to an interchange with a connector road to US 441. I-40 then crosses a long viaduct, and has an interchange with a surface street before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11W|US 11W]] (Rutledge Pike). The highway then enters a predominantly residential area, passing next to the [[Knoxville Zoo]], before coming to an interchange with the eastern terminus of I-640 and leaving Knoxville less than {{convert|1|mi|km}} later. Also at this interchange, I-40 begins a brief (unsigned) concurrency with [[U.S. Route 25W|US 25W]], which splits off a little over {{convert|1|mi|km}} later at an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11E|US 11E]]/70 (Asheville Highway). Leaving Knoxville, I-40 crosses the [[Holston River]] about {{convert|2|mi|km}} later.\n\n====Smoky Mountains and Pigeon River gorge====\n[[File:Mount-cammerer-I40-tn1.jpg|thumb|right|I-40 near mile 441, with [[Mount Cammerer]] rising in the distance]]\nContinuing east as a six-lane highway, I-40 travels through a semi-rural residential area before crossing into [[Sevier County, Tennessee|Sevier County]]. A few miles later, at exit 407, near [[Sevierville, Tennessee|Sevierville]], I-40 has an interchange with the northern terminus of the [[Great Smoky Mountains Parkway]] ([[Tennessee State Route 66|SR 66]]). This interchange is the primary means of access to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, as well as the tourist attractions in the cities of Sevierville, [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee|Pigeon Forge]] and [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee|Gatlinburg]], and, as a result, is reportedly one of the busiest and most congested non-interstate exits in the state. A few miles later, I-40 crosses into [[Jefferson County, Tennessee|Jefferson County]], and about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US25W/70 in [[Dandridge, Tennessee|Dandridge]]. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 92|SR 92]], also in Dandridge. Four miles later, at exit 421 is the interchange with the southern terminus of [[Interstate 81 in Tennessee|I-81]], which runs into [[Northeast Tennessee]] to the so called \"[[Tri-Cities, Tennessee|Tri-Cities]]\" of [[Bristol, Tennessee|Bristol]], [[Kingsport, Tennessee|Kingsport]], and [[Johnson City, Tennessee|Johnson City]]. At this interchange, I-40 reduces back to four lanes and turns sharp southeast, crossing the [[Douglas Dam]] impoundment of the [[French Broad River]] about {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} later, as well as into [[Cocke County, Tennessee|Cocke County]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 411 in Tennessee|US 411]]/70S/25 near [[Newport, Tennessee|Newport]]. Traveling along the northern base of English Mountain for a few miles, I-40 has an interchange with US 321 three miles later. About {{convert|5|mi|km}} later the road has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 73|SR 73]] near [[Cosby, Tennessee|Cosby]], and turns south through the gap between English Mountain and Stone Mountain, revealing a dramatic view of the {{convert|4928|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Mount Cammerer]] at the northeastern end of the Great Smokies range. Also at this point, I-40 enters thr [[Cherokee National Forest]] and proceeds into the [[Pigeon River (Tennessee\u2013North Carolina)|Pigeon River Gorge]] through the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], closely following the north bank of the river. This section is extremely curvy and the speed limit reduces to 55&nbsp;mph due to its susceptibility to accidents. This stretch is also prone to rockslides, and contains mesh nets along some of the cliff slopes as preventative measures. A few miles later I-40 crosses the Pigeon River and has an interchange with the [[Foothills Parkway]], before crossing the pigeon river again about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later and curving sharply to the east. A bout {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, the route curves to the south again near the unincorporated community of [[Hartford, Tennessee|Hartford]] before entering North Carolina about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later.\n\n===Music Highway===\nThe term '''Music Highway''' refers to a section of I-40 between Memphis and Nashville. I-40 was designated as such by an act of the Tennessee Legislature in 1997 \"from the eastern boundary of [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]] to the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]],\" a distance of about {{convert|222|mi|km}}. I-40 is designated as such because of the rich music history in Memphis, Nashville, and the areas in between. Memphis is known as \"the Home of the Blues and the Birthplace of Rock and Roll.\" Nashville is known as \"Music City USA\" for its influence on numerous types of music, especially [[Country music|country]]. Several cities and towns between the two, such as [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], [[Brownsville, Tennessee|Brownsville]], [[Nutbush, Tennessee|Nutbush]], [[Waverly, Tennessee|Waverly]] and others were birthplaces or homes of numerous singers and songwriters. Signs that display the words \"Music Highway\" along with music notes are erected in both directions along I-40, especially at the borders of [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]] and [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]].<ref name=MH>{{cite web |url = http://www.tn.gov/sos/acts/100/pub/Pubc0124.HTM |title = Public Chapter 124 Senate Bill No. 122 |publisher = State of Tennessee |access-date = September 26, 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111014104711/http://www.tn.gov/sos/acts/100/pub/Pubc0124.HTM |archive-date = October 14, 2011 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:I-40 EB-I-75 NB 1 mile to TN 332.jpg|thumb|left|[[Interstate 75 in Tennessee|I-75]] north running [[Concurrency (road)|concurrently]] with I-40 east in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]]]\n\n===Construction and early history===\n\nThe Tennessee leg of I-40 was part of the original {{convert|1047|mi|km}} of Interstate Highways authorized for Tennessee by the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]].

Fearing that the interstate's construction would upset the park's fragile ecological balance, environmentalists, backed by the organization [[Citizens to Preserve Overton Park]], waged a 12-year legal battle to prevent highway construction in the park, culminating in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision, ''[[Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe]]''. The Supreme Court remanded the case to the District Court for further review, and it ruled that the highway commission had not adequately explored alternative routes. In 1981, the highway commission abandoned plans to route I-40 through Overton Park, and instead redesignated the northern portion of [[Interstate 240 (Tennessee)|I-240]] as I-40.<ref>{{harvp|Moore|1994|pp=112\u2013113}}.</ref> For over 20 years, I-40 signage existed on the dead-end route toward Overton Park.

The road connects Tennessee's three largest cities\u2014[[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], and [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]\u2014and crosses all of Tennessee's physiographical provinces and [[Grand Divisions of Tennessee|Grand Divisions]]\u2014the [[Mississippi Embayment]] and [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] in [[West Tennessee]], the [[Highland Rim]] and [[Nashville Basin]] in [[Middle Tennessee]], and the [[Cumberland Plateau]], [[Appalachian Valley and Ridge Province]], and [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge Province]] in [[East Tennessee]]. The Tennessee section of I-40 is {{convert|452|mi|km}} long, the longest of any state on the route.\n\n==Route description==\n\n===West Tennessee===\n====Memphis====\n[[File:Hernando de Soto Bridge Memphis.jpg|thumb|left|The Hernando de Soto Bridge, where I-40 crosses the [[Mississippi River]] into [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]]]\n\nI-40 enters Tennessee via the six lane [[Hernando de Soto Bridge]], which spans the Mississippi River at river mile 736. Immediately within the city of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], the interstate passes across the southern half of [[Mud Island, Memphis|Mud Island]] before crossing the [[Wolf River (Tennessee)|Wolf River Harbor]] into downtown Memphis. Throughout Memphis, the highway contains a minimum of six through lanes, except through major interchanges. Upon reaching Memphis, I-40 immediately has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 51 in Tennessee|U.S. Route&nbsp;51]] (US&nbsp;51), and {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} from the state line is an interchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate 240 (Tennessee)|I-240]], where I-40 abruptly turns north, following a route formerly designated as part of I-240. (For the next {{convert|10|mi|km|disp=sqbr}}, this segment is designated as the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Expressway.) About one mile later, I-40 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 14|State Route 14]] (SR&nbsp;14, Jackson Avenue), and about {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond this point, the highway crosses the Wolf River again and has an interchange with the eastern terminus of [[Tennessee State Route 300|SR&nbsp;300]], a controlled-access connector to US&nbsp;51. At this interchange, the Interstate turns sharp east. Passing first near the neighborhoods of [[Frayser, Memphis|Frayser]] and [[Raleigh, Memphis|Raleigh]], about {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} later, I-40 crosses the Wolf River for a third time as the highway turns southeast, and has an interchange with SR&nbsp;14 again. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 204|SR&nbsp;204]] (Covington Pike), and {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond this point, I-40 comes to a complicated interchange with [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;64]]/[[U.S. Route 70 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;70]]/[[U.S. Route 79 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;79]], I-240 southbound and Sam Cooper Boulevard eastbound, and turns sharp northeast, leaving Memphis. For the next several miles the highway is known as the Isaac Hayes Memorial Highway and is eight lanes, the left lanes functioning as [[HOV lane]]s during [[rush hour]], passing through several major suburbs of Memphis, including [[Bartlett, Tennessee|Bartlett]], [[Cordova, Tennessee|Cordova]], and [[Lakeland, Tennessee|Lakeland]]. At exit 18, which is US&nbsp;64, the highway narrows to six lanes, and to four lanes a short distance beyond. Several miles later, near [[Arlington, Tennessee|Arlington]], at exit 24, is a [[cloverleaf interchange]] with [[Interstate 269|I-269]]/[[Tennessee State Route 385|SR&nbsp;385]].\n\n====Gulf coastal plain====\n\nAbout one mile east of Arlington, I-40 enters [[Fayette County, Tennessee|Fayette County]], and about another mile later crosses the [[Loosahatchie River]] and leaves the Memphis area, traversing through the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] in a very flat and straight stretch of mostly farmland with some rural woodlands, bypassing most cities and communities. At exit 35 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 59|SR 59]], which connects to [[Covington, Tennessee|Covington]] and  [[Somerville, Tennessee|Somerville]]. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Haywood County, Tennessee|Haywood County]], and about {{convert|10|mi|km}} later, the highway turns north and enters the [[Hatchie National Wildlife Refuge]] and crosses the [[Hatchie River]]. Upon exiting the refuge about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later, I-40 turns east and passes just southeast of Brownsville, where it has an interchange first with [[Tennessee State Route 76|SR 76]], which also connects to Somerville. Eight miles later is an interchange with US 70, and {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Madison County, Tennessee|Madison County]]. Entering [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], at mile marker 78, the crosses the [[South Fork of the Forked Deer River|South Fork]] of the [[Forked Deer River]]. Passing through the northern half of the city, I-40 has a total of six exits in Jackson. First, at mile 79, is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 412 in Tennessee|US 412]] (which connects to [[Alamo, Tennessee|Alamo]] and [[Dyersburg, Tennessee|Dyersburg]]), then about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later an interchange with the [[Tennessee State Route 186#U.S. Route 45 Bypass|US 45 Bypass]]. About {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 45|US 45]], which also connects to [[Humboldt, Tennessee|Humboldt]] and [[Milan, Tennessee|Milan]], and about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US 70, which also connects to Huntington, Tennessee|Huntington]], and I-40 leaves Jackson at this point. From this point, I-40 continues east northeast through a sparsely populated area of farmland and woodlands, and about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later enters [[Henderson County, Tennessee|Henderson County]]. About {{convert|15|mi|km}} later, near the community of [[Parkers Crossroads, Tennessee|Parkers Crossroads]], I-40 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 22|SR 22]], a major north-south connector route in west Tennessee, which, at this interchange, is signed as a connector to [[Lexington, Tennessee|Lexington]] and Huntington. A few miles later, I-40 crosses the [[Big Sandy River (Tennessee)|Big Sandy River]] before proceeding through the northern half of the [[Natchez Trace State Park]], and around milepost 120 enters [[Decatur County, Tennessee|Decatur County]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 641|US 641]]/[[Tennessee State Route 69|SR 69]], another major north-south corridor, which at this point connects to [[Camden, Tennessee|Camden]] and [[Decaturville, Tennessee|Decaturville]]. I-40 then enters [[Benton County, Tennessee|Benton County]], and about {{convert|6|mi|km}} later,   descends about {{convert|400|ft|m}} on a steep grade over the course of a mile, the westbound lanes gaining a [[truck climbing lane]], before crossing the [[Tennessee River]] into [[Middle Tennessee]] on the {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} [[Jimmy Mann Evans Memorial Bridge]]. This river crossing is also located within the [[Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge]].\n\n===Middle Tennessee===\n====Western highland rim====\n\nUpon crossing the Tennessee River into [[Humphreys County, Tennessee|Humphreys County]], I-40 traverses through mostly vast woodlands in the rugged hills of the Western [[Highland Rim]] for a considerable distance. This section is characterized by several noticeable upgrades and downgrades, with mostly minor curves. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} beyond the Tennessee River is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 13|SR 13]], which connects to [[Linden, Tennessee|Linden]] and [[Waverly, Tennessee|Waverly]]. About {{convert|5|mi|km}} later, I-40 crosses into [[Hickman County, Tennessee|Hickman County]] and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 50|SR 50]], which connects to [[Centerville, Tennessee|Centerville]]. I-40 then crosses the [[Duck River (Tennessee)|Duck River]], traveling through mostly wooded areas characterized by further rugged terrain, and at mile 163 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 48|SR 48]], the first exit for [[Dickson, Tennessee|Dickson]]. I-40 then enters [[Dickson County, Tennessee|Dickson County]], and shortly beyond this point crosses the [[Piney River (Middle Tennessee)|Piney River]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 46|SR 46]], the second Dickson exit which also connects to Centerville and [[Columbia, Tennessee|Columbia]]. Approaching the urban parts of the [[Nashville metropolitan area]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} later is the western terminus of [[Interstate 840 (Tennessee)|Interstate 840]], the outer southern beltway around Nashville. The highway continues through mostly woodlands and rugged terrain, and crossing into [[Williamson County, Tennessee|Williamson County]], I-40 briefly enters a steep ascent, gaining a truck climbing lane on the eastbound side, and {{convert|6|mi|km}} beyond I-840 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 96|SR 96]], which connects to the Nashville suburbs of [[Fairview, Tennessee|Fairview]] and [[Franklin, Tennessee|Franklin]]. A few miles later, I-40 enters [[Cheatham County, Tennessee|Cheatham County]], and descends into the [[Nashville Basin]] between mile markers 186 and 188, and still in a predominantly rural area, has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 248|SR 248]] in [[Kingston Springs, Tennessee|Kingston Springs]]. I-40 the crosses the [[Harpeth River]] twice over a distsnce of about {{convert|1|mi|km}}.\n\n====Nashville====\n[[File:Destinations from Interstate 40-65 (Exit 209, 209A, 209B) in Nashville.JPG|thumb|right|Destination sign for exit 209/209A/209B in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]]]\nAround milepost 191, I-40 enters [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]], and a few miles later crosses the Harpeth River for a third time. About a mile later, near\n[[Bellevue, Tennessee|Bellevue]], I-40 widens to six lanes, entering the urban outskirts of Nashville, and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 70S|US 70S]]. Three miles later is an exit with [[Tennessee State Route 251|SR 251]] ([[Old Hickory Boulevard]]), and {{convert|2|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US 70. Widening to eight lanes, three miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 155|SR 155]] (Briley Pkwy, White Bridge Road), including the western terminus of the northern controlled-access beltway around Nashville. About two miles later is the western terminus of [[Interstate 440 (Tennessee)|I-440]], the southern loop around central Nashville. Two miles later, I-40 enters [[Downtown Nashville]], and begins a brief concurrency with [[Interstate 65 in Tennessee|I-65]], turning southeast. As part of the route around downtown Nashville known locally as the Downtown Loop, the two concurrent routs have interchanges with US 70 (Charlotte Avenue) and US 70S/[[U.S. Route 431 in Tennessee|431]] (Broadway), as well as two surface streets, Church Street and Demonbreun Street. About two miles later the two concurrent routes turn east northeast, and I-65 splits off and heads south. Briefly on its own for about {{convert|1|mi|km}}, I-40 crosses a long viaduct, and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 31A|US 31A]]/[[U.S. Route 41 Alternate (Monteagle, Tennessee\u2013Hopkinsville, Kentucky)|41A]] (4th Avenue, 2nd Avenue), before beginning a brief concurrency with [[Interstate 24#Tennessee|I-24]] and turning southeast. About {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, I-24 splits off, and I-40 turns east. The eastern terminus of I-440 is also directly accessible from the east bound lanes of I-40 at this interchange, and [[U.S. Route 41 in Tennessee|US 41]], which crosses I-24 before this interchange, is also directly accessible from I-40 at this interchange.\n[[File:Interstate 40 @ Beckwith.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 near Mount Juliet, east of Nashville.]]\nAbout {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later, I-40 has an interchange with SR 155 (Briley Parkway) near the [[Nashville International Airport]], and about a mile later, the eastbound lanes have a direct access partial-y exit to a surface road to the airport. The westbound lanes of I-40 are only accessible from this interchange. Less than a half mile later is an exit with [[Tennessee State Route 255|SR 255]] (Donelson Pike), and beginning here, the left lanes of I-40 function as HOV lanes during rush hour. Passing near [[J. Percy Priest Dam]], I-40 has an interchange with Stewarts Ferry Pike, then crosses the [[Stones River]], and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 45|SR 45]] (Old Hickory Boulevard). Also at this interchange is a separate partial y interchange which provides access to SR 45 via a bypass which junctions with SR 45 about {{convert|3/4|mi|km}} north of I-40. This bypass is only accessible via the eastbound lanes of I-40, and the westbound lanes are only accessible from it. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Wilson County, Tennessee|Wilson County]], and few miles later has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 171|SR 171]] near the Nashville suburb of [[Mount Juliet, Tennessee|Mount Juliet]]. Six miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 109|SR 109]], which connects to [[Gallatin, Tennessee|Gallatin]].  About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later and about {{convert|25|mi|km}} east of Nashville, the route narrows back to four lanes and has an interchange with the eastern terminus of I-840 a few miles east of [[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon]]. I-40 the enters Lebanon and has interchanges with [[U.S. Route 231|US 231]] and US 70.\n\n====Western Highland Rim and Cumberland Plateau====\nFor the next roughly {{convert|50|mi|km}}, I-40 continues across mostly open farmland, passing near mostly small communities. About {{convert|10|mi|km}} east of Lebanon, I-40 enters [[Smith County, Tennessee|Smith County]], and less than {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later I-40 begins a steep ascent where the eastbound lanes gain a truck climbing lane. This lane terminates about {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} later, and about {{convert|5.5|mi|km}} beyond this point is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 53|SR 53]] near [[Carthage, Tennessee|Carthage]] and [[Gordonsville, Tennessee|Gordonsville]]. Between mileposts 263 and 266, I-40 crosses the meandering [[Caney Fork River]] five times before crossing into [[Putnam County, Tennessee|Putnam County]] and beginning its ascent out of the [[Eastern Highland Rim]] onto the [[Cumberland Plateau]]. At milepost 268, I-40 has an interchange once again with SR 96, and a few miles later reaches an elevation of {{convert|1000|ft|m}} for the first time in the state near [[Silver Point, Tennessee|Silver Point]], and beginning at the edge of the table-top rim at mile marker 272 near [[Baxter, Tennessee|Baxter]], the interstate remains relatively flat across the plateau. I-40 then immediately has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 56|SR 56]] southbound/[[Tennessee State Route 141|SR 141]], which connect to [[Smithville, Tennessee|Smithville]] and [[McMinnville, Tennessee|McMinnville]]. Beginning a concurrency with SR 56 at this point, the latter route splits off {{convert|7|mi|km}} later, heading north towards [[Gainesboro, Tennessee|Gainesboro]]. Reaching [[Cookeville, Tennessee|Cookeville]] about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later, I-40 has a total of five interchanges,\nincluding with [[Tennessee State Route 111|SR 111]], a major north-south connector to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and US [[U.S. Route 70N|70N]]. Beginning a few miles beyond this point, I-40 begins another steep uphill ascent, protracted over a distance of about {{convert|5|mi}}, reaching an elevation of more than {{convert|2,000|ft|m}}. Through this section, the speed limit reduces to 65 mph, and 55 mph for trucks on the westbound descent. Continuing through a predominantly wooded area, continues for about {{convert|10|mi|km}} through a predominantly wooded area, before reaching [[Monterey, Tennessee|Monterey]] a few miles later, where the route has two interchanges with US 70N, which contain concurrencies with [[Tennessee State Route 84|SR 84]] and [[Tennessee State Route 62|SR 62]], respectively. A short distance later, I-40 crosses into [[Cumberland County, Tennessee|Cumberland County]] and [[East Tennessee]].\n\n===East Tennessee===\n\n====Cumberland Plateau and Tennessee Valley====\n[[File:Cumberland-plateau-i40-tn1.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 descending [[Walden Ridge]], miles 341\u2013346]]\n\nAfter ascending further up into the Walden Ridge/Cumberland Plateau and passing through Monterey, I-40 remains relatively flat and straight as it continues across the Cumberland Plateau. At mile 308, I-40 crosses the [[Tennessee Divide]], where the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] and [[Tennessee River]] watersheds meet. The divide is marked in the eastbound lanes with a sign reading \"Entering [[Emory River]] watershed.\" In the westbound counterparts is a sign noting the beginning of the Caney Fork watershed. About ten miles later, I-40 reaches [[Crossville, Tennessee|Crossville]], and has three interchanges, including one  with [[U.S. Route 127 in Tennessee|US 127]], which also conbects to [[Jamestown, Tennessee|Jamestown]]. \nEast of Crossville, the [[Crab Orchard Mountains]], the southern fringe of the [[Cumberland Mountains]], come into view as the road descends several hundred feet. At mile 329, the interstate enters Crab Orchard Gap and proceeds through a narrow valley once prone to [[landslide|rockslide]]s. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-40 gas an interchange with US 70 near the town of [[Crab Orchard, Tennessee|Crab Orchard]]. At mile 340, the Interstate crosses into [[Roane County, Tennessee|Roane County]] entering the [[Eastern Time Zone]], and shortly thereafter the road begins its descent of the Cumberland Plateau into the [[Tennessee Valley]] and the speed limit is 60&nbsp;mph to 70&nbsp;mph. I-40 hugs the slopes of the plateau's [[Walden Ridge]] escarpment for several miles, containing what some describe as dramatic views of the Tennessee Valley below to the south, before reaching the base of the plateau at mile 347 between [[Harriman, Tennessee|Harriman]] and [[Rockwood, Tennessee|Rockwood]], and containing an interchange with [[U.S. Route 27 in Tennessee|US 27]]. As it enters the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians|Ridge-and-Valley]] province of the Appalachians, of which the Tennessee Valley is a part, I-40 crosses a series of ridges and valleys characteristic of the region's topography. About {{convert|4|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 29|SR 29]], and about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, the road crosses the Clinch River, with the [[Kingston Fossil Plant]] and its {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} twin smokestacks dominating the view to the north. About {{convert|1|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 58|SR 58]] southbound in [[Kingston, Tennessee|Kingston]], and at this point, I-40 begins a brief concurrency with SR 58. After ascending a short and relatively steep ridge out of the Clinch River Valley, SR 58 splits off to the north about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later, heading towards [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]]. Continuing through the relatively rugged terrain of the Great Appalachian Valley and crossing additional ridges, I-40 crosses into [[Loudon County, Tennessee|Loudon County]] about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 321|US 321]]/[[Tennessee State Route 95|SR 95]] near Lenoir city, before reaching I-75 about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later.\n\n====Knoxville====\n{{See also|Interstate 75 in Tennessee#Knoxville}}\nAt exit 368, about 20 miles west southwest of downtown Knoxville, I-40 merges with [[Interstate 75 in Tennessee|I-75]], which continues to the southwest to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and the two routes turn east northeast, carrying six through lanes, and cross into [[Knox County, Tennessee|Knox County]] a short distance later. Throughout this concurrency, exits are numbered according to I-40 mileage. The two highways pass through several of the western suburbs of Knoxville,  including [[Farragut, Tennessee|Farragut]], and have interchanges with a few surface streets. At exit 374 ([[Tennessee State Route 131|SR 131]]/Lovell Road), the highway widens to eight lanes and at the next exit, about {{convert|1.25|mi|km}} later, is an interchange with the [[Pellissippi Parkway]] (SR 162 westbound, I-140 eastbound), which connects to Oak Ridge and [[Maryville, Tennessee|Maryville]], respectively. Continuing through western Knoxville, the two rputes have interchanges with additional surface streets, before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11 in Tennessee|US 11]]/70 {{convert|4|mi|km}} later near the [[West Hills, Knoxville|West Hills]] neighborhood. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 332|SR 332]] (Northshore Drive), and the separate Papermill Drive and Weisgarber Road. Two miles later, at exit 385, is an interchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate 640|I-640]], a beltway which passes northwest of downtown Knoxville. Also at this exit, I-75 splits off from I-40 onto a concurrency with I-640, splitting off a few miles later and heading towards [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. The route then enters downtown Knoxville, containing a minimum of six through lanes through the entirety of central Knoxville, as well as several short segments of [[auxiliary lane]]s between exits. Passing near the main campus of the [[University of Tennessee]], as well as several residential neighborhoods, about \n{{convert|1.5|mi|km}} past I-640 is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 129 in Tennessee|US 129]], which connects to [[McGhee Tyson Airport]] and is a route to the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]. One mile later is an interchange with SR 62 (Western Avenue), and a mile beyond this point is an interchange with [[Interstate 275 (Tennessee)|I-275]]. About {{convert|1/4|mi|km}} later, in a complicated interchange, I-40 has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 441 in Tennessee|US 441]] south (Henley Street), and begins a brief concurrency with this route, which splits off about {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later, along with [[Tennessee State Route 158|SR 158]] westbound, as controlled-access [[James White Parkway]]. I-40 then curves sharp north, and about {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later, sharp east again before coming to an interchange with a connector road to US 441. I-40 then crosses a long viaduct, and has an interchange with a surface street before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11W|US 11W]] (Rutledge Pike). The highway then enters a predominantly residential area, passing next to the [[Knoxville Zoo]], before coming to an interchange with the eastern terminus of I-640 and leaving Knoxville less than {{convert|1|mi|km}} later. Also at this interchange, I-40 begins a brief (unsigned) concurrency with [[U.S. Route 25W|US 25W]], which splits off a little over {{convert|1|mi|km}} later at an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11E|US 11E]]/70 (Asheville Highway). Leaving Knoxville, I-40 crosses the [[Holston River]] about {{convert|2|mi|km}} later.\n\n====Smoky Mountains and Pigeon River gorge====\n[[File:Mount-cammerer-I40-tn1.jpg|thumb|right|I-40 near mile 441, with [[Mount Cammerer]] rising in the distance]]\nContinuing east as a six-lane highway, I-40 travels through a semi-rural residential area before crossing into [[Sevier County, Tennessee|Sevier County]]. A few miles later, at exit 407, near [[Sevierville, Tennessee|Sevierville]], I-40 has an interchange with the northern terminus of the [[Great Smoky Mountains Parkway]] ([[Tennessee State Route 66|SR 66]]). This interchange is the primary means of access to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, as well as the tourist attractions in the cities of Sevierville, [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee|Pigeon Forge]] and [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee|Gatlinburg]], and, as a result, is reportedly one of the busiest and most congested non-interstate exits in the state. A few miles later, I-40 crosses into [[Jefferson County, Tennessee|Jefferson County]], and about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US25W/70 in [[Dandridge, Tennessee|Dandridge]]. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 92|SR 92]], also in Dandridge. Four miles later, at exit 421 is the interchange with the southern terminus of [[Interstate 81 in Tennessee|I-81]], which runs into [[Northeast Tennessee]] to the so called \"[[Tri-Cities, Tennessee|Tri-Cities]]\" of [[Bristol, Tennessee|Bristol]], [[Kingsport, Tennessee|Kingsport]], and [[Johnson City, Tennessee|Johnson City]]. At this interchange, I-40 reduces back to four lanes and turns sharp southeast, crossing the [[Douglas Dam]] impoundment of the [[French Broad River]] about {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} later, as well as into [[Cocke County, Tennessee|Cocke County]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 411 in Tennessee|US 411]]/70S/25 near [[Newport, Tennessee|Newport]]. Traveling along the northern base of English Mountain for a few miles, I-40 has an interchange with US 321 three miles later. About {{convert|5|mi|km}} later the road has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 73|SR 73]] near [[Cosby, Tennessee|Cosby]], and turns south through the gap between English Mountain and Stone Mountain, revealing a dramatic view of the {{convert|4928|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Mount Cammerer]] at the northeastern end of the Great Smokies range. Also at this point, I-40 enters thr [[Cherokee National Forest]] and proceeds into the [[Pigeon River (Tennessee\u2013North Carolina)|Pigeon River Gorge]] through the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], closely following the north bank of the river. This section is extremely curvy and the speed limit reduces to 55&nbsp;mph due to its susceptibility to accidents. This stretch is also prone to rockslides, and contains mesh nets along some of the cliff slopes as preventative measures. A few miles later I-40 crosses the Pigeon River and has an interchange with the [[Foothills Parkway]], before crossing the pigeon river again about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later and curving sharply to the east. A bout {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, the route curves to the south again near the unincorporated community of [[Hartford, Tennessee|Hartford]] before entering North Carolina about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later.\n\n===Music Highway===\nThe term '''Music Highway''' refers to a section of I-40 between Memphis and Nashville. I-40 was designated as such by an act of the Tennessee Legislature in 1997 \"from the eastern boundary of [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]] to the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]],\" a distance of about {{convert|222|mi|km}}. I-40 is designated as such because of the rich music history in Memphis, Nashville, and the areas in between. Memphis is known as \"the Home of the Blues and the Birthplace of Rock and Roll.\" Nashville is known as \"Music City USA\" for its influence on numerous types of music, especially [[Country music|country]]. Several cities and towns between the two, such as [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], [[Brownsville, Tennessee|Brownsville]], [[Nutbush, Tennessee|Nutbush]], [[Waverly, Tennessee|Waverly]] and others were birthplaces or homes of numerous singers and songwriters. Signs that display the words \"Music Highway\" along with music notes are erected in both directions along I-40, especially at the borders of [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]] and [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]].<ref name=MH>{{cite web |url = http://www.tn.gov/sos/acts/100/pub/Pubc0124.HTM |title = Public Chapter 124 Senate Bill No. 122 |publisher = State of Tennessee |access-date = September 26, 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111014104711/http://www.tn.gov/sos/acts/100/pub/Pubc0124.HTM |archive-date = October 14, 2011 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:I-40 EB-I-75 NB 1 mile to TN 332.jpg|thumb|left|[[Interstate 75 in Tennessee|I-75]] north running [[Concurrency (road)|concurrently]] with I-40 east in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]]]\n\n===Construction and early history===\n\nThe Tennessee leg of I-40 was part of the original {{convert|1047|mi|km}} of Interstate Highways authorized for Tennessee by the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]].

Fearing that the interstate's construction would upset the park's fragile ecological balance, environmentalists, backed by the organization [[Citizens to Preserve Overton Park]], waged a 12-year legal battle to prevent highway construction in the park, culminating in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision, ''[[Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe]]''. The Supreme Court remanded the case to the District Court for further review, and it ruled that the highway commission had not adequately explored alternative routes. In 1981, the highway commission abandoned plans to route I-40 through Overton Park, and instead redesignated the northern portion of [[Interstate 240 (Tennessee)|I-240]] as I-40.<ref>{{harvp|Moore|1994|pp=112\u2013113}}.</ref> For over 20 years, I-40 signage existed on the dead-end route toward Overton Park.

It is now deserted, the last resident having left in 1938. Its history dates back to the [[12th century]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe earliest form of Pitmiddle's name was ''Petmeodhel'' (''pet'' being a [[Pict]]ish word meaning ''piece of land'', while the origin of ''meodhel'' is unknown).<ref name=psns/>\n\n==Geography==\nLocated southwest of [[Abernyte]] in the centre of the parish of [[Kinnaird, Gowrie|Kinnaird]], Pitmiddle \"was once a thriving hilltop community and home to several hundred people\",<ref name=courier>''[[The Courier (Dundee)|The Courier]]'', 11 April 2020, pp. 22 & 23</ref> but its remote location eventually led to its [[abandoned village|abandonment]].<ref name=courier/> The hills referenced are the Braes of the Carse, which reach heights of around {{convert|180|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns>[http://www.psns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/PSNS-Pitmiddle-Village-and-Elcho-Nunnery-1988-complete-book.pdf \"Pitmiddle Village and Elcho Nunnery - Research and Excavation on Tayside\"] - Perthshire Society of Natural Science (1988)</ref>\n\nThe location is on a slope overlooking the [[River Tay]], but sheltered from the south by Guardswell Hill and to the north by Pitmiddle Hill, which rises to over {{convert|275|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns/> \n\n==History==\nAlthough Pitmiddle was first called a [[toun]] in 1425,<ref name=psns/> the earliest reference to Pitmiddle is in a charter dating from 1172 to 1174. In it, [[William the Lion]] granted Ralph Rufus \"Kinnaird in its right divisions except ''Petmeodhel'' belonging to Richard my clerk\". This demonstrates that Pitmiddle and Kinnaird were originally [[royal land]]s. Pitmiddle belonged to the [[laird]] of [[Inchture|Inchmartine]]; Kinnaird to the laird of [[Fingask]]. Pitmiddle was held by the Inchmartines for around 150 years. The village itself was never a [[Barony (county division)|barony]], but was likely dealt with as a detached part of the barony of [[Longforgan]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nTenants paid ''cain'' and ''conveth''. Cain was originally a donation to a lord in recognition of his position. Conveth was a hospitality payment made to a lord on his annual visit to his estate. These were originally [[payment]] [[in kind]], in produce from the land.<ref name=psns/> Some tenants may have been [[free tenant|free]], but most were held in some degree of [[serfdom]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe Ogilvy family owned five-sixths of Inchmartine and Pitmiddle in the late [[15th century]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe village was not involved in the [[Jacobite risings]] of 1715 and 1745, but the neighbouring estate of Kinnaird was lost after 1715 due to its owner, Threipland of Fingask, being a supporter of the Jacobite movement.<ref name=psns/>\n\nAgricultural changes in the [[18th century]] affected the nature of the community, eventually leading to its abandonment.<ref name=psns/>\n\nBy 1783, two more touns had been established on land belonging to Pitmiddle, effectively  depriving it of most of its farmland. These were Newtown (now Outfield) to the northeast and Bank (now Guardswell) to the southeast.<ref name=psns/>\n\nAfter the [[Scottish Reformation]], Kinnaird became a separate parish.<ref name=psns/>\n\nToday, hidden amongst farmland and woods, the only remnants of the community are a few crumbling walls and the wild [[redcurrant]] and [[gooseberry]] bushes that once grew in the residents' gardens.<ref name=courier/>\n\n===Settlement and families===\nWilliam Thomassoun was living in Pitmiddle in the 15th century as a \"small but free tenant\". He had a son, Richard.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn 1691, around 250 people lived in the village, along with the hamlet of Craigdallie, which was at the bottom of the hill.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nOn a 1783 map by James Stobie, Pitmiddle appeared as an irregularly shaped cluster of dwellings. The buildings would have been single-storied, made of [[wattle-and-daub]], roofed with turf or thatch. There would be a single room for living space, with one end cordoned-off for animals. An open hearth would have provided heat, possibly with a hole in the roof to extract smoke. Domestic rubbish would have been thrown onto a [[midden]] near the entrance. Attached to the hut was a yard where hens or pigs foraged and vegetables were grown. Enclosing the settlement was a ditch, beyond which was the arable land, and separated from it by the head [[dyke]] was the pasture.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe main crops grown at Pitmeddle, per three [[17th century|17th-century]] rent rolls, were [[Bere (grain)|bere]] (a four-eared variety of barley) and oats. These also formed the basis of the peasants' diets. [[Wheat]] was later also grown.<ref name=psns/>\n\nPitmiddle is believe to have had a [[shieling]] on Blacklaw (Black Hill) to the north. By 1609, these had been turned into a sheep farm.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the [[16th century]], wright Androu Benbie (possibly Benvie) was living as a [[wright]]. Edmund Jackson was fined ten [[shilling]]s for \"striking the common hird on the [[Sabbath]]\".<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the 17th century, due to a greater survival in documentary evidence, more family names are known. These include: Anderson, Christal, Mores (possibly Morris or Moreis), Morton (possibly Mortoun), Millar, Blair, Mitchell, Whittet, Duncan, Paterson, Ogilvy, Young, Boug, Deucat (possibly Deugatt), Smyth, Christie, Robertson, Matthew, Thom, Gairdner (possibly Gardiner), Bowack (possibly Book, Boug or Boyok), Will, Hall, Muir (possibly Moor or Mure), Pirie (possibly Pierie), Martine and Lawson (possibly Lousone). In 1650, there were 19 tenants.<ref name=psns/>\n\nEarly in the 19th century, the homes at Pitmiddle were rebuilt in stone, seemingly on the site of their timber predecessors. They were single storey and thatched. The floors were stone flagged and the fireplaces were built into the gables. The houses were divided into two rooms by box beds. The kitchen fireplace had hooks for kettles and pans. Ashes were kept back by a piece of iron. Around the fireplace was a fender, with a fender stool. The 1861 census showed that all households had two rooms with windows, except John Soutar's farmhouse, which had three. By 1891, there were three families each living in a cottage with three rooms with windows and two families with only one such room, the rest still having two such rooms.

It is now deserted, the last resident having left in 1938. Its history dates back to the [[12th century]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe earliest form of Pitmiddle's name was ''Petmeodhel'' (''pet'' being a [[Pict]]ish word meaning ''piece of land'', while the origin of ''meodhel'' is unknown).<ref name=psns/>\n\n==Geography==\nLocated southwest of [[Abernyte]] in the centre of the parish of [[Kinnaird, Gowrie|Kinnaird]], Pitmiddle \"was once a thriving hilltop community and home to several hundred people\",<ref name=courier>''[[The Courier (Dundee)|The Courier]]'', 11 April 2020, pp. 22 & 23</ref> but its remote location eventually led to its [[abandoned village|abandonment]].<ref name=courier/> The hills referenced are the Braes of the Carse, which reach heights of around {{convert|180|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns>[http://www.psns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/PSNS-Pitmiddle-Village-and-Elcho-Nunnery-1988-complete-book.pdf \"Pitmiddle Village and Elcho Nunnery - Research and Excavation on Tayside\"] - Perthshire Society of Natural Science (1988)</ref>\n\nThe location is on a slope overlooking the [[River Tay]], but sheltered from the south by Guardswell Hill and to the north by Pitmiddle Hill, which rises to over {{convert|275|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns/> \n\n==History==\nAlthough Pitmiddle was first called a [[toun]] in 1425,<ref name=psns/> the earliest reference to Pitmiddle is in a charter dating from 1172 to 1174. In it, [[William the Lion]] granted Ralph Rufus \"Kinnaird in its right divisions except ''Petmeodhel'' belonging to Richard my clerk\". This demonstrates that Pitmiddle and Kinnaird were originally [[royal land]]s. Pitmiddle belonged to the [[laird]] of [[Inchture|Inchmartine]]; Kinnaird to the laird of [[Fingask]]. Pitmiddle was held by the Inchmartines for around 150 years. The village itself was never a [[Barony (county division)|barony]], but was likely dealt with as a detached part of the barony of [[Longforgan]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nTenants paid ''cain'' and ''conveth''. Cain was originally a donation to a lord in recognition of his position. Conveth was a hospitality payment made to a lord on his annual visit to his estate. These were originally [[payment]] [[in kind]], in produce from the land.<ref name=psns/> Some tenants may have been [[free tenant|free]], but most were held in some degree of [[serfdom]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe Ogilvy family owned five-sixths of Inchmartine and Pitmiddle in the late [[15th century]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe village was not involved in the [[Jacobite risings]] of 1715 and 1745, but the neighbouring estate of Kinnaird was lost after 1715 due to its owner, Threipland of Fingask, being a supporter of the Jacobite movement.<ref name=psns/>\n\nAgricultural changes in the [[18th century]] affected the nature of the community, eventually leading to its abandonment.<ref name=psns/>\n\nBy 1783, two more touns had been established on land belonging to Pitmiddle, effectively  depriving it of most of its farmland. These were Newtown (now Outfield) to the northeast and Bank (now Guardswell) to the southeast.<ref name=psns/>\n\nAfter the [[Scottish Reformation]], Kinnaird became a separate parish.<ref name=psns/>\n\nToday, hidden amongst farmland and woods, the only remnants of the community are a few crumbling walls and the wild [[redcurrant]] and [[gooseberry]] bushes that once grew in the residents' gardens.<ref name=courier/>\n\n===Settlement and families===\nWilliam Thomassoun was living in Pitmiddle in the 15th century as a \"small but free tenant\". He had a son, Richard.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn 1691, around 250 people lived in the village, along with the hamlet of Craigdallie, which was at the bottom of the hill.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nOn a 1783 map by James Stobie, Pitmiddle appeared as an irregularly shaped cluster of dwellings. The buildings would have been single-storied, made of [[wattle-and-daub]], roofed with turf or thatch. There would be a single room for living space, with one end cordoned-off for animals. An open hearth would have provided heat, possibly with a hole in the roof to extract smoke. Domestic rubbish would have been thrown onto a [[midden]] near the entrance. Attached to the hut was a yard where hens or pigs foraged and vegetables were grown. Enclosing the settlement was a ditch, beyond which was the arable land, and separated from it by the head [[dyke]] was the pasture.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe main crops grown at Pitmeddle, per three [[17th century|17th-century]] rent rolls, were [[Bere (grain)|bere]] (a four-eared variety of barley) and oats. These also formed the basis of the peasants' diets. [[Wheat]] was later also grown.<ref name=psns/>\n\nPitmiddle is believe to have had a [[shieling]] on Blacklaw (Black Hill) to the north. By 1609, these had been turned into a sheep farm.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the [[16th century]], wright Androu Benbie (possibly Benvie) was living as a [[wright]]. Edmund Jackson was fined ten [[shilling]]s for \"striking the common hird on the [[Sabbath]]\".<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the 17th century, due to a greater survival in documentary evidence, more family names are known. These include: Anderson, Christal, Mores (possibly Morris or Moreis), Morton (possibly Mortoun), Millar, Blair, Mitchell, Whittet, Duncan, Paterson, Ogilvy, Young, Boug, Deucat (possibly Deugatt), Smyth, Christie, Robertson, Matthew, Thom, Gairdner (possibly Gardiner), Bowack (possibly Book, Boug or Boyok), Will, Hall, Muir (possibly Moor or Mure), Pirie (possibly Pierie), Martine and Lawson (possibly Lousone). In 1650, there were 19 tenants.<ref name=psns/>\n\nEarly in the 19th century, the homes at Pitmiddle were rebuilt in stone, seemingly on the site of their timber predecessors. They were single storey and thatched. The floors were stone flagged and the fireplaces were built into the gables. The houses were divided into two rooms by box beds. The kitchen fireplace had hooks for kettles and pans. Ashes were kept back by a piece of iron. Around the fireplace was a fender, with a fender stool. The 1861 census showed that all households had two rooms with windows, except John Soutar's farmhouse, which had three. By 1891, there were three families each living in a cottage with three rooms with windows and two families with only one such room, the rest still having two such rooms. Attached to the houses were wooden sheds, [[byre]]s and small gardens. The village's water supply was sourced from three wells.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe rebuilding of the village failed to halt Pitmiddle's demise. A once-thriving community of weavers, a blacksmith, two joiners, a tailor, a butcher and a public house<ref name=scotsman/> was now seeing young people leaving to work in the factories in nearby [[Dundee]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nJust under one hundred people, living in 26 households, made up Pitmiddle's population in 1841.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nIn December 1896, ''[[The Dundee Courier]]'' sent two reporters to Pitmiddle (which had seven families living there at the time) to investigate its living conditions after reports of \"clearance-style\" conditions on the hill.
