The FILMPLOT guideline recommends 700 words at most. -->\nA pampered [[Jack Russell Terrier]] named Max lives with his owner Katie in a [[Manhattan]] apartment. While Katie is at work during the day, Max hangs out with other pets in the building: [[tabby cat]] Chloe, [[pug]] Mel, [[dachshund]] Buddy, and [[budgerigar]] Sweet Pea. One day, Katie adopts Duke, a large [[Newfoundland dog|Newfoundland]] [[mongrel|mix]] from the pound, leaving Max jealous because of her divided focus on Duke. Enraged by Max's attitude towards him, Duke tries to abandon Max in an alley, but they are both attacked by cats led by [[Sphynx cat]] Ozone who steals both dogs' collars and leaves them to be caught by Animal Control. Duke fears that he will be [[animal euthanasia|killed]] if he goes back to the pound. When Gidget, a white [[Pomeranian (dog)|Pomeranian]] who has a crush on Max, discovers that he is missing, she decides to find him.\n\nAfter the van crashes in an alleyway, Max and Duke are rescued by a white rabbit named Snowball, the leader of \"The Flushed Pets\"\u2014a cult of feral sewer-dwelling animals who hate humans because their owners mistreated and abandoned them. After Max and Duke pretend to despise humans as much as they do by saying they killed their owners, the Flushed Pets invite them to join. Before they can prove their loyalty by [[Snakebite|allowing a one-fanged viper to bite them]], the alley cats barge in and inform Snowball that Max and Duke are still pets. Their cover blown, the two dogs escape the sewers and board a ferry to Brooklyn, inadvertently killing the viper in the process. Snowball vows vengeance to kill them and leads the Flushed Pets after them.\n\nMeanwhile, Gidget befriends a [[red-tailed hawk]] named Tiberius to find Max, and soon locates Ozone, whom Gidget coerces into telling what he knows about the dogs. They then enlist Mel, Buddy, Chloe, [[guinea pig]] Norman and Sweet Pea. On the way, they meet Pops, an old [[Basset Hound]] who helps Gidget and the pets find Max. Gidget and her team encounter Snowball, who vows to kill them as well, and Norman is captured as the rest of Gidget's team flees.\n\nIn the meantime, Max and Duke raid a sausage factory for food. While there, Duke tells Max about his previous owner, Fred, an elderly man who adopted him as a puppy and loved spending time with him. One day, Duke got lost while chasing a butterfly and was caught by Animal Control, but Fred never came to claim him. Max convinces him to visit Fred's house in a nearby neighborhood, confident Fred will still love him and take him back. When they arrive at Fred's house, they learn from the resident cat Reginald that Fred has died. Heartbroken, Duke accuses Max of attempting to get rid of him and barks at the new homeowners who have just returned to the house and called Animal Control. The handlers catch Max, but Duke interferes long enough for Max to escape and ends up being captured instead.\n\nWhile trying to rescue Duke as he follows the Animal Control van, Max is attacked by Snowball who tries to kill him. However, when his gang is captured, Snowball realizes that he and Max must work together to rescue them. They drive a city bus into the van on the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], stopping traffic. The Flushed Pets encircle Max, unaware of his partnership with Snowball, who is currently unconscious, but Gidget and her team save him. Upon seeing Gidget using her kung-fu fighting skills, Max starts to fall in love with her. The van gets stuck in scaffolding and the Flushed Pets escape. As soon as Max gets the keys to Duke's cage, the van plummets into the [[East River]] with him inside. Max is unable to free Duke, so Snowball jumps into the river to retrieve the keys, allowing them to escape the sinking van.\n\nThe entire group returns to the apartment block by pig-driven taxi. Max expresses his love for Gidget, who returns his affection. Snowball and the Flushed Pets then come up with a new plan to annihilate all humans, but a woman and her daughter named Molly arrives and adopts Snowball and the remaining Flushed Pets return to the sewers. At first, Snowball resists, but gives in and lets himself become a domesticated pet once again. Snowball soon goes home with Molly and her mother while the other pets return to their homes and embrace their owners, and Max and Duke finally reunite with Katie, sparking a true friendship as brothers. \n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Buddy and Mel show up in costume at a party in poodle Leonard's apartment, hosted by a now-friendlier Snowball.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Please see the Talk page before

The FILMPLOT guideline recommends 700 words at most. -->\nA pampered [[Jack Russell Terrier]] named Max lives with his owner Katie in a [[Manhattan]] apartment. While Katie is at work during the day, Max hangs out with other pets in the building: [[tabby cat]] Chloe, [[pug]] Mel, [[dachshund]] Buddy, and [[budgerigar]] Sweet Pea. One day, Katie adopts Duke, a large [[Newfoundland dog|Newfoundland]] [[mongrel|mix]] from the pound, leaving Max jealous because of her divided focus on Duke. Enraged by Max's attitude towards him, Duke tries to abandon Max in an alley, but they are both attacked by cats led by [[Sphynx cat]] Ozone who steals both dogs' collars and leaves them to be caught by Animal Control. Duke fears that he will be [[animal euthanasia|killed]] if he goes back to the pound. When Gidget, a white [[Pomeranian (dog)|Pomeranian]] who has a crush on Max, discovers that he is missing, she decides to find him.\n\nAfter the van crashes in an alleyway, Max and Duke are rescued by a white rabbit named Snowball, the leader of \"The Flushed Pets\"\u2014a cult of feral sewer-dwelling animals who hate humans because their owners mistreated and abandoned them. After Max and Duke pretend to despise humans as much as they do by saying they killed their owners, the Flushed Pets invite them to join. Before they can prove their loyalty by allowing a one-fanged viper to bite them, the alley cats barge in and inform Snowball that Max and Duke are still pets. Their cover blown, the two dogs escape the sewers and board a ferry to Brooklyn, inadvertently killing the viper in the process. Snowball vows vengeance to kill them and leads the Flushed Pets after them.\n\nMeanwhile, Gidget befriends a [[red-tailed hawk]] named Tiberius to find Max, and soon locates Ozone, whom Gidget coerces into telling what he knows about the dogs. They then enlist Mel, Buddy, Chloe, [[guinea pig]] Norman and Sweet Pea. On the way, they meet Pops, an old [[Basset Hound]] who helps Gidget and the pets find Max. Gidget and her team encounter Snowball, who vows to kill them as well, and Norman is captured as the rest of Gidget's team flees.\n\nIn the meantime, Max and Duke raid a sausage factory for food. While there, Duke tells Max about his previous owner, Fred, an elderly man who adopted him as a puppy and loved spending time with him. One day, Duke got lost while chasing a butterfly and was caught by Animal Control, but Fred never came to claim him. Max convinces him to visit Fred's house in a nearby neighborhood, confident Fred will still love him and take him back. When they arrive at Fred's house, they learn from the resident cat Reginald that Fred has died. Heartbroken, Duke accuses Max of attempting to get rid of him and barks at the new homeowners who have just returned to the house and called Animal Control. The handlers catch Max, but Duke interferes long enough for Max to escape and ends up being captured instead.\n\nWhile trying to rescue Duke as he follows the Animal Control van, Max is attacked by Snowball who tries to kill him. However, when his gang is captured, Snowball realizes that he and Max must work together to rescue them. They drive a city bus into the van on the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], stopping traffic. The Flushed Pets encircle Max, unaware of his partnership with Snowball, who is currently unconscious, but Gidget and her team save him. Upon seeing Gidget using her kung-fu fighting skills, Max starts to fall in love with her. The van gets stuck in scaffolding and the Flushed Pets escape. As soon as Max gets the keys to Duke's cage, the van plummets into the [[East River]] with him inside. Max is unable to free Duke, so Snowball jumps into the river to retrieve the keys, allowing them to escape the sinking van.\n\nThe entire group returns to the apartment block by pig-driven taxi. Max expresses his love for Gidget, who returns his affection. Snowball and the Flushed Pets then come up with a new plan to annihilate all humans, but a woman and her daughter named Molly arrives and adopts Snowball and the remaining Flushed Pets return to the sewers. At first, Snowball resists, but gives in and lets himself become a domesticated pet once again. Snowball soon goes home with Molly and her mother while the other pets return to their homes and embrace their owners, and Max and Duke finally reunite with Katie, sparking a true friendship as brothers. \n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Buddy and Mel show up in costume at a party in poodle Leonard's apartment, hosted by a now-friendlier Snowball.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Please see the Talk page before

In the 28th minute, [[Hattan Bahebri]] dribbled past [[Ri Il-jin]] and sent a curler from the left to give Saudi Arabia the lead. [[Housain Al-Mogahwi]]\u2019s free-kick from just outside the box sailed into the box and [[Mohammed Al-Fatil]] diverted it into the net with a back heel to double Saudi Arabia's advantage. Just a minute before the break [[Han Kwang-song]] received a second yellow card for a tackle on Al-Mogahwi, and North Korea were reduced to 10 men. North Korea came close in the 64th minute through skipper [[Jong Il-gwan]] but the Saudi defenders regrouped to deny him. Moments later, Saudi Arabia had a missed opportunity with [[Fahad Al-Muwallad]] sidestepping defender [[Kim Chol-bom]] and goalkeeper [[Ri Myong-guk]], but his shot flew wide. In the 70th minute, [[Salem Al-Dawsari]] was left unmarked and the Saudi captain made no mistake from the centre of the box to make it 3\u20130. In the 87th minute, defender [[Kim Song-gi]] failed to clear [[Hamdan Al-Shamrani]]\u2019s cross into the box, and Al-Muwallad slammed the ball into the back of the net to seal Saudi Arabia's first opening AFC Asian Cup match win since they emerged champions in 1996.<ref>{{cite web |title=Saudi Arabia 4\u20130 DPR Korea |url=http://www.the-afc.com/asiancup/news/group-e-saudi-arabia-4-0-dpr-korea |work=AFC |accessdate=9 January 2019 |date=8 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n<section begin=e1 />{{Football box\n|date       = {{Start date|2019|1|8|df=y}}\n|time       = 20:00\n|team1      = {{fb-rt|KSA}}\n|score      = {{score link|2019 AFC Asian Cup Group E#Saudi Arabia vs North Korea|4\u20130}}\n|team2      = {{fb|PRK}}\n|goals1     =\n*[[Hattan Bahebri|Bahebri]] {{goal|28}}\n*[[Mohammed Al-Fatil|Al-Fatil]] {{goal|37}}\n*[[Salem Al-Dawsari|Al-Dawsari]] {{goal|70}}\n*[[Fahad Al-Muwallad|Al-Muwallad]] {{goal|87}}\n|goals2     =\n|stadium    = [[Rashid Stadium]], [[Dubai]]\n|attendance = 5,075\n|referee    = [[Peter Green (referee)|Peter Green]] ([[Football Federation Australia|Australia]])\n|report     = http://stats.the-afc.com/match_report/13279\n}}<section end=e1 />\n\n{| width=92%\n|-\n|{{Football kit\n |pattern_la = _sarab18h\n |pattern_b  = _sarab18h\n |pattern_ra = _sarab18h\n |pattern_sh =\n |pattern_so = _ksa18h\n |leftarm    = FFFFFF\n |body       = FFFFFF\n |rightarm   = FFFFFF\n |shorts     = FFFFFF\n |socks      = FFFFFF\n |title      = {{nowrap|Saudi Arabia}}\n}}\n|{{Football kit\n |pattern_la = _dpr1617a\n |pattern_b  = _dpr1617a\n |pattern_ra = _dpr1617a\n |pattern_sh = _dpr1617a\n |pattern_so =\n |leftarm    = FF0000\n |body       = FF0000\n |rightarm   = FF0000\n |shorts     = FF0000\n |socks      = FF0000\n |title      = {{nowrap|North Korea}}\n}}\n|}\n\n{| width=\"100%\"\n|valign=\"top\" width=\"40%\"|\n{| style=\"font-size:90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|-\n!width=25| !!width=25|\n|-\n|GK ||'''21'''||[[Mohammed Al-Owais]]\n|-\n|RB ||'''2''' ||[[Mohammed Al-Breik]]\n|-\n|CB ||'''4''' ||[[Ali Al-Bulaihi]]\n|-\n|CB ||'''23'''||[[Mohammed Al-Fatil]]\n|-\n|LB ||'''13'''||[[Yasser Al-Shahrani]] || || {{suboff|82}}\n|-\n|DM ||'''14'''||[[Abdullah Otayf]]\n|-\n|RM ||'''11'''||[[Hattan Bahebri]] || || {{suboff|78}}\n|-\n|CM ||'''10'''||[[Salem Al-Dawsari]] ([[Captain (association football)|c]]) || {{yel|45+1}}\n|-\n|CM ||'''20'''||[[Abdulaziz Al-Bishi]] || || {{suboff|71}}\n|-\n|LM ||'''16'''||[[Housain Al-Mogahwi]]\n|-\n|CF ||'''19'''||[[Fahad Al-Muwallad]]\n|-\n|colspan=3|'''Substitutions:'''\n|-\n|MF ||'''18'''||[[Abdulrahman Ghareeb]] || || {{subon|71}}\n|-\n|FW ||'''9''' ||[[Mohammed Al-Saiari]] || || {{subon|78}}\n|-\n|DF ||'''12'''||[[Hamdan Al-Shamrani]] || || {{subon|82}}\n|-\n|colspan=3|'''Manager:'''\n|-\n|colspan=3|{{flagicon|ESP}} [[Juan Antonio Pizzi]]\n|}\n|valign=\"top\"|[[File:KSA-PRK 2019-01-08.svg|300px]]\n|valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n{| style=\"font-size:90%;

Maatouk pulled the trigger on an effort of his own just before half-time, but his scissor kick flew high over the bar. Two minutes after the hour mark, the 2018 AFC Player of the Year, [[Abdelkarim Hassan]] was introduced from the bench for [[Abdulkarim Al-Ali]] and within three minutes the Qataris took the lead from [[Bassam Al-Rawi]]'s strike from a free kick.
