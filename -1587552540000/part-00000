More than half of the original Erie Canal was destroyed or abandoned at the time of construction of the [[New York State Barge Canal]] in the early 20th century. The sections of the original route remaining in use, mostly west of Syracuse, were widened significantly, with bridges over the canal rebuilt and locks replaced.\n\nAt the time, it was called the Barge Canal. With the disappearance of commercial traffic and its replacement with recreational travel in the later 20th century, the original name returned, and Barge Canal is rarely used.\na\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Erie-canal 1840 map.jpg|thumb|left|Erie Canal map c. 1840]]\nFrom the first days of the expansion of the [[Thirteen Colonies|British colonies]] from the coast of North America into the heartland of the continent, a recurring problem was that of transportation between the coastal ports and the interior. This was not unique to the Americas, and the problem still exists in those parts of the world where [[muscle power]] provides a primary means of transportation within a region. An equally ancient solution was implemented in many cultures{{spnd}}floating vessels move more easily than land vehicles since friction is significantly less. Close to the seacoast, rivers often provided adequate waterways, but the [[Appalachian Mountains]], {{convert|400|mi}} inland, running over {{convert|1500|mi}} long as a [[barrier range]] with just five places where [[Mule#Mule train|mule trains]] or [[wagon road]]s could be routed,<ref name=FiveXings>The five east\u2013west crossings of the Appalachians are: <br />{{bull\n}}Plains of Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi (around the bottom), <br />{{bull\n}}the [[Cumberland Gap]] pass connecting [[North Carolina]]/Southern [[Virginia]] with [[Kentucky]]/[[Tennessee]], <br />{{bull\n}}the [[Cumberland Narrows]] pass connecting [[Cumberland, Maryland]] (in [[Western Maryland]]) and [[Northern Virginia]] with [[West Virginia]] and [[Western Pennsylvania]] via [[Brownsville, Pennsylvania]] and the [[Monongahela River]] or the [[Youghiogheny River]] valley (both of the Ohio & Mississippi river system), <br />{{bull\n}}the [[gaps of the Allegheny]] connecting the [[Susquehanna River]] Valley in central Pennsylvania with the [[Allegheny River]] valley (and again the [[Ohio Country]]), <br />{{bull\n}}and lastly, the [[Mohawk River]] [[water gap]] and valley tributary of the [[Hudson River]], creating what later advertising would call the level water route westwards.\n\n</ref> presented a great challenge. Passengers and freight had to travel overland, a journey made more difficult by the rough condition of the roads. In 1800, it typically took 2\u00bd weeks to travel overland from New York to [[Cleveland, Ohio]], ({{convert|460|mi}}) and 4 weeks to [[Detroit]] ({{convert|612|mi}}).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://railroads.unl.edu/documents/view_document.php?id=rail.str.0241|title=Railroads and the Making of Modern America &#124; Search|website=railroads.unl.edu}}</ref>\n\nThe principal exportable product of the [[Ohio Valley]] was grain, which was a high-volume, low-priced commodity, bolstered by supplies from the coast. Frequently it was not worth the cost of transporting it to far-away population centers. This was a factor leading to farmers in the west turning their grains into [[whiskey]] for easier transport and higher sales, and later the [[Whiskey Rebellion]]. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, it became clear to coastal residents that the city or state that succeeded in developing a cheap, reliable route to the West would enjoy economic success, and the port at the seaward end of such a route would see business increase greatly.<ref>Joel Achenbach, \"America's River; From [[George Washington|Washington]] and [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]] to the Army Corps of Engineers, everyone had grandiose plans to tame the [[Potomac River|Potomac]].

The idea of a canal to tie the East Coast to the new western settlements was discussed as early as 1724: New York provincial official [[Cadwallader Colden]] made a passing reference (in a report on fur trading) to improving the natural waterways of western New York.\n\n[[Gouverneur Morris]] and [[Elkanah Watson]] were early proponents of a canal along the Mohawk River. Their efforts led to the creation of the \"Western and Northern Inland Lock Navigation Companies\" in 1792, which took the first steps to improve navigation on the Mohawk and construct a canal between the Mohawk and Lake Ontario,<ref>Calhoun, Daniel Hovey. The American civil engineer: Origins and conflict. Technology Press, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1960.</ref> but it was soon discovered that private financing was insufficient.\n[[Christopher Colles]] (who was familiar with the Bridgewater Canal) surveyed the Mohawk Valley, and made a presentation to the New York state legislature in 1784, proposing a shorter canal from [[Lake Ontario]]. The proposal drew attention and some action but was never implemented.\n\n[[Jesse Hawley (merchant)|Jesse Hawley]] had envisioned encouraging the growing of large quantities of grain on the western New York plains (then largely unsettled) for sale on the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern seaboard]]. However, he went [[bankrupt]] trying to ship grain to the coast. While in [[Canandaigua (city), New York|Canandaigua]] [[debtors' prison]], Hawley began pressing for the construction of a canal along the {{convert|90|mi|adj=on}}-long [[Mohawk River]] valley with support from [[Joseph Ellicott]] (agent for the [[Holland Land Company]] in [[Batavia (city), New York|Batavia]]). Ellicott realized that a canal would add value to the land he was selling in the western part of the state. He later became the first canal commissioner.\n\nNew York legislators became interested in the possibility of building a canal across New York in the first decade of the 19th century. Shipping goods west from Albany was a costly and tedious affair; there was no railroad yet, and to cover the distance from Buffalo to New York City by stagecoach took two weeks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/erie-canal-opens|title=Erie Canal opens|last=History.com Editors|first=|date=2019-07-27|website=HISTORY|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref>\n\n===Engineering requirements===\n\n[[File:New_York_Relief_1.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Relief map of New York State.|The [[Mohawk Valley]], running east and west, cuts a natural pathway ([[Wind gap (topography)|water gap]]) between the [[Catskill Mountains]] to the south and the [[Adirondack Mountains]] to the north]]\n\nThe Mohawk River (a tributary of the Hudson) rises near Lake Ontario and runs in a [[Quaternary glaciation|glacial meltwater]] channel just north of the [[Catskills|Catskill range]] of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], separating them from the geologically distinct [[Adirondacks]] to the north. The Mohawk and Hudson valleys form the only cut across the Appalachians north of [[Alabama]], allowing an almost complete water route from New York City in the south to Lake Ontario and Lake Erie in the west. Along its course and from these lakes, other Great Lakes, and to a lesser degree, related rivers, a large part of the continent's interior (and many settlements) would be made well connected to the Eastern seaboard.\n\nThe problem was that the land rises about {{convert|600|ft|m}} from the Hudson to Lake Erie. Locks at the time could handle up to {{convert|12|ft|m}} of lift, so even with the heftiest [[cutting (transportation)|cuttings]] and [[viaduct]]s, fifty locks would be required along the {{convert|360|mi|km|adj=on}} canal. Such a canal would be expensive to build even with modern technology; in 1800, the expense was barely imaginable. President [[Thomas Jefferson]] called it \"little short of madness\" and rejected it;<ref>{{cite web |last1=Berkes |first1=Anna |title=Little short of madness...(Quotation) |url=https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/little-short-madnessquotation |website=Monticello.org |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref> however, Hawley interested New York Governor [[DeWitt Clinton]] in the project. There was much opposition, and the project was ridiculed as \"Clinton's folly\" and \"Clinton's ditch.\" In 1817, though, Clinton received approval from the legislature for $7 million for construction.<ref name=\"Finch\"/>\n\nThe original canal was {{convert|363|mi|km}} long, from Albany on the Hudson to Buffalo on Lake Erie. The channel was cut {{convert|40|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|4|ft|m}} deep, with removed soil piled on the downhill side to form a walkway known as a [[towpath]].<ref name=\"Finch\"/>\n\nIts construction, through [[limestone]] and mountains, proved a daunting task. In 1823 construction reached the [[Niagara Escarpment]], necessitating the building of five locks along a {{convert|3|mi|adj=on}} corridor to carry the canal over the escarpment. To move earth, animals pulled a \"slip scraper\" (similar to a bulldozer). The sides of the canal were lined with stone set in clay, and the bottom was also lined with clay. The stonework required hundreds of German masons, who later built many of New York's buildings.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} All labor on the canal depended upon human (and animal) power or the force of water. Engineering techniques developed during its construction included the building of [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueducts]] to redirect water; one aqueduct was {{convert|950|ft}} long to span {{convert|800|ft}} of river. As the canal progressed, the crews and engineers working on the project developed expertise and became a skilled labor force.\n\n[[File:1832 Erie Canal.jpg|thumb|center|upright=4.1|Profile of the original canal|alt=Elevation drawing of the canal's length]]\n\n===Freight boats===\n[[File:Lockport bartlett color crop.jpg|thumb|Operations at [[Lockport (city), New York|Lockport, New York]] in 1839]]\n\nCanal boats up to {{convert|3.5|ft|m}} in draft were pulled by horses and mules walking on the towpath. The canal had one towpath, generally on the north side. When [[barge|canal boats]] met, the boat with the right of way<!--How was this determined? A: good q. One would guess it was the boat traveling west as right dominates on all navigations, but one could also have afforded the bigger vessel priority, a citation is needed.--> remained on the towpath side of the canal. The other boat steered toward the berm (or heelpath) side of the canal. The driver (or \"hoggee\", pronounced HO-gee) of the privileged boat kept his towpath team by the canalside edge of the towpath, while the hoggee of the other boat moved to the outside of the towpath and stopped his team. His towline would be unhitched from the horses, go slack, fall into the water and sink to the bottom, while his boat coasted with its remaining momentum. The privileged boat's team would step over the other boat's towline, with its horses pulling the boat over the sunken towline without stopping. Once clear, the other boat's team would continue on its way.\n\nPulled by teams of horses, canal boats moved slowly, but methodically, shrinking time and distance. Efficiently, the smooth, nonstop method of transportation cut the travel time between Albany and Buffalo nearly in half, moving by day and by night. Migrants took passage on freight boats, camping on deck or on top of crates.\n\n===Passenger boats===\nPacket boats, serving passengers exclusively, reached speeds of up to five miles an hour, and ran at much more frequent intervals than the cramped, bumpy stagecoach wagons.<ref name=\"Sheriff\">{{Cite book|title=The Artificial River: The Erie Canal and the Paradox of Progress 1817\u20131862|last=Sheriff|first=Carol|publisher=Hill & Wang|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8090-2753-8|location=|url=https://archive.org/details/artificialrivere00sher|url-access=registration}}</ref>{{rp|54}} Packet boats, measuring up to 78 feet long and 14.5 feet wide, made ingenious use of space, accommodating up to 40 passengers at night and up to three times as many in the daytime.<ref name=\"Sheriff\" />{{rp|59}} The best examples, furnished with carpeted floors, stuffed chairs, and mahogany tables stocked with books and current newspapers, served as sitting rooms during the days.

At that rate, the canal would not be finished for 30 years. The main delays were caused by felling trees to clear a path through [[virgin forest]] and moving excavated soil, which took longer than expected, but the builders devised ways to solve these problems. To fell a tree, they threw rope over the top branches and winched it down. They pulled out the stumps with an innovative [[Stump harvesting|stump puller]]. Two huge wheels were mounted loose on the ends of an axle. A third wheel, slightly smaller than the others, was fixed to the center of the axle. A chain was wrapped around the axle and hooked to the stump. A rope was wrapped around the center wheel and hooked to a team of oxen. The [[mechanical advantage]] (torque) obtained ripped the stumps out of the soil. Soil to be moved was shoveled into large wheelbarrows that were dumped into mule-pulled carts. Using a scraper and a plow, a three-man team with oxen, horses and mules could build a mile in a year.<ref name = \"Hunter 1991\">{{cite book|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930, Vol. 3: The Transmission of Power |last=Hunter |first=Louis C. |authorlink= |author2=Bryant, Lynwood |year=1991 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts, London |isbn=978-0-262-08198-6 |page=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OrFHAAAAYAAJ }}</ref>\n\nThe remaining problem was finding labor; increased [[immigration]] helped fill the need.

Buffalo expended great energy to widen and deepen [[Buffalo River (New York)|Buffalo Creek]] to make it navigable and to create a harbor at its mouth. Buffalo won over Black Rock, and grew into a large city, eventually encompassing its former rival.\n\nThe entire canal was officially completed on October 26, 1825. The event was marked by a statewide \"Grand Celebration,\" culminating in a series of cannon shots along the length of the canal and the Hudson, a 90-minute [[cannonade]] from Buffalo to New York City. A flotilla of boats, led by Governor Dewitt Clinton aboard ''Seneca Chief'', sailed from Buffalo to New York City over ten days. Clinton then ceremonially poured Lake Erie water into New York Harbor to mark the \"Wedding of the Waters.\" On its return trip, ''Seneca Chief'' brought back a keg of [[Atlantic Ocean]] water, which was poured into Lake Erie by Buffalo's Judge [[Samuel Wilkeson]], who would later become mayor.\n\nThe Erie Canal was thus completed in eight years at a cost of $7.143 million<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ransom |first1=Roger |title=Canals and Development: A Discussion of the Issues |journal=American Economic Review |date=May 1964 |volume=54 |issue=3 |page=375}}</ref> ({{Inflation|US|7143000|1817|fmt=eq|r=-6}}).{{Inflation-fn|US}}  It was acclaimed as an engineering marvel that united the country and helped New York City develop as an international trade center.<ref name=\"Finch\"/>\n\n==Route==\n[[File:Erie Canal Map 1853.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|1853 Map of New York canals emboldened, center: the Erie Canal; other lines: railroads, rivers and county borders]]\n[[File:Erie canal lockport c1855.jpg|thumb|Lithograph of the Erie Canal at Lockport, New York c.1855.

At [[Cohoes, New York|Cohoes]], it climbed the escarpment on the west side of the Hudson River\u201416 locks rising {{convert|140|ft}}\u2014and then turned west along the south shore of the Mohawk River, crossing to the north side at [[Crescent, New York|Crescent]] and again to the south at [[Rexford, New York|Rexford]]. The canal continued west near the south shore of the Mohawk River all the way to Rome, where the Mohawk turns north.<ref name=\"Finch\"/>\n\nAt [[Rome, New York|Rome]], the canal continued west parallel to [[Wood Creek]], which flows westward into [[Oneida Lake]], and turned southwest and west cross-country to avoid the lake. From [[Canastota, New York|Canastota]] west, it ran roughly along the north (lower) edge of the [[Onondaga Formation|Onondaga Escarpment]], passing through Syracuse, [[Onondaga Lake]], and Rochester. Before reaching Rochester, the canal uses a series of natural ridges to cross the deep valley of [[Irondequoit Creek]]. At [[Lockport (city), New York|Lockport]] the canal turned southwest to rise to the top of the [[Niagara Escarpment]], using the ravine of [[Eighteen Mile Creek (Niagara County)|Eighteen Mile Creek]].<ref name=\"Finch\"/>\n\nThe canal continued south-southwest to [[Pendleton, New York|Pendleton]], where it turned west and southwest, mainly using the channel of [[Tonawanda Creek]]. From the [[City of Tonawanda|Tonawanda]] south toward Buffalo, it ran just east of the Niagara River, where it reached its \"Western Terminus\" at Little Buffalo Creek (later it became the [[Commercial Slip]]), which discharged into the [[Buffalo River (New York)|Buffalo River]] just above its confluence with [[Lake Erie]].<ref name=\"Finch\"/> With Buffalo's re-excavation of the Commercial Slip, completed in 2008, the Canal's original terminus is now re-watered and again accessible by boats. With several miles of the Canal inland of this location still lying under 20th-century fill and urban construction, the effective western navigable terminus of the Erie Canal is found at Tonawanda.\n\nThe Erie made use of the favorable conditions of New York's unique topography, which provided that area with the only break in the [[Appalachian mountains|Appalachians]] south of the [[Saint Lawrence River]]. The Hudson is tidal to [[Troy, New York|Troy]], and Albany is west of the Appalachians.

Leaks developed along the entire length of the canal, but these were sealed using [[cement]] that hardened underwater ([[hydraulic cement]]). Erosion on the clay bottom proved to be a problem and the speed was limited to {{convert|4|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe original design planned for an annual tonnage of 1.5 million tons (1.36 million metric tons), but this was exceeded immediately. An ambitious program to improve the canal began in 1834. During this massive series of construction projects, known as the First Enlargement, the canal was widened from {{convert|40|to|70|ft|m}} and deepened from {{convert|4|to|7|ft|m}}. Locks were widened and/or rebuilt in new locations, and many new [[navigable aqueduct]]s were constructed. The canal was straightened and slightly re-routed in some stretches, resulting in the abandonment of short segments of the original 1825 canal. The First Enlargement was completed in 1862, with further minor enlargements in later decades.\n\nToday, the reconfiguration of the canal created during the First Enlargement is commonly referred to as the \"Improved Erie Canal\" or the \"[[Old Erie Canal State Historic Park|Old Erie Canal]]\", to distinguish it from the canal's modern-day course. Existing remains of the 1825 canal abandoned during the Enlargement are officially referred to today as \"Clinton's Ditch\" (which was also the popular nickname for the entire Erie Canal project during its original 1817\u20131825 construction).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/vinylboy20/14342144437/|title=Clintons Ditch (1)|date=June 14, 2014|via=Flickr}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Erie Canal, Lock 32.jpg|thumb|right|Upstream view of the downstream lock at Lock 32, [[Pittsford (village), New York|Pittsford, New York]]]]\n\nAdditional feeder canals soon extended the Erie Canal into a system. These included the Cayuga-Seneca Canal south to the [[Finger Lakes]], the Oswego Canal from Three Rivers north to Lake Ontario at [[Oswego, New York|Oswego]], and the Champlain Canal from [[Troy, New York|Troy]] north to Lake Champlain. From 1833 to 1877, the short Crooked Lake Canal connected [[Keuka Lake]] and [[Seneca Lake (New York)|Seneca Lake]]. The [[Chemung Canal]] connected the south end of Seneca Lake to [[Elmira, New York|Elmira]] in 1833, and was an important route for Pennsylvania [[coal]] and [[timber]] into the canal system. The [[Chenango Canal]] in 1836 connected the Erie Canal at Utica to [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]] and caused a business boom in the [[Chenango River]] valley. The Chenango and Chemung canals linked the Erie with the [[Susquehanna River]] system. The [[Black River Canal]] connected the [[Black River (New York)|Black River]] to the Erie Canal at Rome and remained in operation until the 1920s. The [[Genesee Valley Canal]] was run along the [[Genesee River]] to connect with the [[Allegheny River]] at [[Olean, New York|Olean]], but the Allegheny section, which would have connected to the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, was never built. The Genesee Valley Canal was later abandoned and became the route of the [[Genesee Valley Canal Railroad]].\n\nIn 1903 the New York State legislature authorized construction of the [[New York State Barge Canal]] as the \"Improvement of the Erie, the Oswego, the Champlain, and the Cayuga and Seneca Canals\".<ref name=\"Whiteford\">{{Cite book |title=History of the Barge Canal of New York State |last=Whiteford |first=Noble E. |year=1922 |publisher=J.

Those cities and their states started projects to compete with the Erie Canal. In Pennsylvania, the [[Main Line of Public Works]] was a combined canal and railroad running west from Philadelphia to [[Pittsburgh]] on the [[Ohio River]], opened in 1834. In Maryland, the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] ran west to [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], then a part of Virginia, also on the Ohio River, and was completed in 1853.\n\nOther competition was more direct. The [[Mohawk and Hudson Railroad]] opened in 1837, providing a bypass to the slowest part of the canal between Albany and Schenectady. Other railroads were soon chartered and built to continue the line west to Buffalo, and in 1842 a continuous line (which later became the [[New York Central Railroad]] and its [[Auburn and Syracuse Railroad#Auburn road|Auburn Road]] in 1853) was open the whole way to Buffalo. As the railroad served the same general route as the canal, but provided for faster travel, passengers soon switched to it. However, as late as 1852, the canal carried thirteen times more freight tonnage than all the railroads in New York State combined; it continued to compete well with the railroads through 1902, when tolls were abolished.\n\nDuring [[John D. Rockefeller|Rockefeller's]] consolidations of the late 1860s and early 1870s, he used the canal as a cheaper form of transportation \u2013 in the summer months when it was not frozen \u2013 to get his refined oil from Cleveland to New York City. In the winter months his only options were the three trunk lines: the [[Erie Railroad]], the [[New York Central Railroad]], or the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hawke|first=David Freeman|title=John D.

However, it went bankrupt and was acquired the next year by the New York Central.\n\n==Impact==\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2012}}\n[[File:Rochester erie canal aqueduct circa 1890.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rochester, New York]] aqueduct circa 1890]]\nThe Erie Canal greatly lowered the cost of shipping between the Midwest and the Northeast, bringing much lower food costs to Eastern cities and allowing the East to economically ship machinery and manufactured goods to the Midwest. The canal also made an immense contribution to the wealth and importance of New York City, Buffalo and New York State. Its impact went much further, increasing trade throughout the nation by opening eastern and overseas markets to Midwestern farm products and by enabling migration to the West.<ref name=\"Taylor 1951\">{{cite book |title=The Transportation Revolution, 1815\u20131860 |last=Taylor |first=George Rogers |authorlink= |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-0-87332-101-3 |pages=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nHonAQAAIAAJ |year=1951 }}\n</ref><ref name=\"North1966\">\n{{cite book |title=The Economic Growth of the United States 1790\u20131860 |last=North |first=Douglas C. |authorlink= |year=1966 |publisher=W.

Tolls collected on freight had already exceeded the state's construction debt in its first year of official operation.<ref name=\"Sheriff\" />{{rp|52}} By 1828, import duties collected at the New York Customs House supported federal government operations and provided funds for all the expenses in Washington except the interest on the national debt.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fordham: A history of the Jesuit university of New York: 841\u20132003|last=Shelley|first=Thomas|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780823271511|location=New York|page=51|quote=|via=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RvsmDAAAQBAJ}}</ref> Additionally, New York State's initial loan for the original canal had been paid by 1837.<ref name=\"Sheriff\" />{{rp|52}} Although it had been envisioned as primarily a commercial channel for freight boats, passengers also traveled on the canal's packet boats. In 1825 more than 40,000 passengers took advantage of the convenience and beauty of canal travel.<ref name=\"Sheriff\" />{{rp|52}} The canal's steady flow of tourists, businessmen and settlers lent it to uses never imagined by its initial sponsors. Evangelical preachers made their circuits of the upstate region, and the canal served as the last leg of the Underground Railroad ferrying runaway slaves to Buffalo near the Canada\u2013US border.<ref name=\"Sheriff\" />{{rp|53}} Aspiring merchants found that tourists were reliable customers. Vendors moved from boat to boat peddling items such as books, watches and fruit, while less scrupulous \"confidence men\" sold remedies for foot corns or passed off counterfeit bills.<ref name=\"Sheriff\" />{{rp|53}} Tourists were carried along the \"northern tour,\" which ultimately led to the popular honeymoon destination Niagara Falls, just north of Buffalo.\n\nConsisting of a massive stone aqueduct which carried boats over incredible cascades, Little Falls was one of the most popular stops for American and foreign tourists. This is shown in Scene 4 of William Dunlap's play ''A Trip to Niagara'', where he depicts the general preference of tourists to travel by canal so that they could experience a combination of artificial and natural sights.<ref name=\"Sheriff\" />{{rp|55}} Canal travel was, for many, an opportunity to take in the sublime and commune with nature. The play also reflects the less enthusiastic view of some who saw movement on the canal as tedious.\n\nNew ethnic Irish communities formed in some towns along its route after completion, as Irish immigrants were a large portion of the construction labor force. Earth extracted from the canal was transported to the New York City area and used as landfill in New York and New Jersey.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} A plaque honoring the canal's construction is located in [[The Battery (Manhattan)|Battery Park]] in southern Manhattan.\n\nBecause so many immigrants traveled on the canal, many [[genealogist]]s have sought copies of canal passenger lists. Apart from the years 1827\u20131829, canal boat operators were not required to record passenger names or report them to the government, which, in this case, was the state of New York. Some passenger lists survive today in the New York State Archives, and other sources of traveler information are sometimes available.\n\nThe Canal also helped bind the still-new nation closer to Britain and Europe. Repeal of Britain's [[Corn Law]] resulted in a huge increase in exports of Midwestern wheat to Britain. Trade between the United States and Canada also increased as a result of the repeal and a reciprocity (free-trade) agreement signed in 1854. Much of this trade flowed along the Erie.\n\nIts success also prompted imitation: a rash of canal-building followed. Also, the many technical hurdles that had to be overcome made heroes of those whose innovations made the canal possible. This led to an increased public esteem for practical education. [[Chicago]], among other [[Great Lakes]] cities, recognized the importance of the canal to its economy, and two [[Chicago Loop|West Loop]] streets are named \"Canal\" and \"Clinton\" (for canal proponent DeWitt Clinton).\n\nConcern that erosion caused by logging in the [[Adirondack Mountains|Adirondacks]] could silt up the canal contributed to the creation in 1885 of another New York National Historic Landmark, the [[Adirondack Park]].\n\n[[File:Erie Canal Lift Bridge Lockport July 2010.JPG|thumb|right|Two \"low\" lift bridges in [[Lockport, New York]] July 2010]]\nMany notable authors wrote about the canal, including [[Herman Melville]], [[Frances Trollope]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Samuel Hopkins Adams]] and the [[Marquis de Lafayette]], and many tales and songs were written about life on the canal. The popular song \"[[Low Bridge]]\" by [[Thomas S. Allen]] was written in 1905 to memorialize the canal's early heyday, when barges were pulled by mules rather than engines.\n\n==Sunday closing debate==\nThe New York State Legislature debated closing the locks of the Erie Canal on Sundays, when they convened in 1858. However, George Jeremiah and Dwight Bacheller, two of the bill's opponents, argued that the state had no right to stop canal traffic on the grounds that the Erie Canal and its tributaries had ceased to be wards of the state. The canal at its inception had been imagined as an extension of nature, an artificial river where there had been none. The canal succeeded by sharing more in common with lakes and seas than it had with public roads. Jeremiah and Bacheller argued, successfully, that just as it was unthinkable to halt oceangoing navigation on Sunday, it was so with the canal.<ref name=\"Sheriff\" />{{rp|172}}\n\n==20th century==\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2013}}\n[[File:BaldwinsvilleLock24.jpg|thumb|right|<!--max img sz-->The modern Erie Canal has 34 locks, which are painted with the blue and gold colors of the [[New York State Canal System]]]]\nIn 1918, the Canal was replaced by the larger [[New York State Canal System|New York State Barge Canal]]. This new canal replaced much of the original route, leaving many abandoned sections (most notably between Syracuse and Rome). New digging and flood control technologies allowed engineers to [[river engineering|canalize]] rivers that the original canal had sought to avoid, such as the Mohawk, [[Seneca River (New York)|Seneca]], and [[Clyde River (New York)|Clyde]] rivers, and Oneida Lake. In sections that did not consist of canalized rivers<ref name=\"Whiteford\" /> (particularly between Rochester and Buffalo), the original Erie Canal channel was enlarged to {{convert|120|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|12|ft|m}} deep. The expansion allowed barges up to {{convert|2000|ST|t}} to use the Canal. This expensive project was politically unpopular in parts of the state not served by the canal, and failed to save it from becoming obsolete for commercial shipping.\n\nThe new alignment began on the Hudson River at the border between Cohoes and [[Waterford, New York|Waterford]], where it ran northwest with five locks (the so-called \"Waterford Flight\"), running into the Mohawk River east of [[Crescent, New York|Crescent]]. The Waterford Flight is claimed to be one of the steepest series of locks in the world.<ref name=ASCE-RPI>{{cite web|title=Dedication of the Flight of Five Locks as a Civil Engineering Landmark (9/9/2012) |url=http://rpiasce.weebly.com/recent-asce-events.html |work=ASCE Rennselaer |publisher=American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), RPI Chapter |accessdate=March 2, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216071318/http://rpiasce.weebly.com/recent-asce-events.html |archivedate=December 16, 2013 }}</ref><!-- Previous interim reference should be improved --><ref name=\"Finch\" />{{rp|19}}<ref name=\"Williams\" />{{rp|267}}\n\n[[File:Sunset over the Erie Canal in North Tonawanda, NY..jpg|thumb|left|Gateway Harbor in [[North Tonawanda, New York|North Tonawanda]], about 1000 feet from the present day western terminus of the Erie Canal where it connects to the Niagara River]]\n\nWhile the old Canal ran next to the Mohawk all the way to Rome, the new canal ran through the river, which was straightened or widened where necessary.<ref name=\"Finch\" />{{rp|13}} At [[Ilion, New York|Ilion]], the new canal left the river for good, but continued to run on a new alignment parallel to both the river and the old canal to Rome. From Rome, the new route continued almost due west, merging with [[Fish Creek (New York)|Fish Creek]] just east of its entry into Oneida Lake.<ref name=\"ECAsystem\" />\n\nFrom Oneida Lake, the new canal ran west along the [[Oneida River]], with cutoffs to shorten the route. At [[Three Rivers, New York|Three Rivers]] the Oneida River turns northwest, and was deepened for the Oswego Canal to Lake Ontario. The new Erie Canal turned south there along the Seneca River, which turns west near Syracuse and continues west to a point in the [[Montezuma Marsh]]. There the Cayuga and Seneca Canal continued south with the Seneca River, and the new Erie Canal again ran parallel to the old canal along the bottom of the Niagara Escarpment, in some places running along the Clyde River, and in some places replacing the old canal. At [[Pittsford (village), New York|Pittsford]], southeast of Rochester, the canal turned west to run around the south side of Rochester, rather than through downtown. The canal crosses the [[Genesee River]] at the [[Genesee Valley Park]], then rejoins the old path near [[North Gates, New York|North Gates]].\n\nFrom there it was again roughly an upgrade to the original canal, running west to Lockport.<ref name=\"NYPA\" /> This reach of 64.2 miles from Henrietta to Lockport is called \"the 60\u2011mile level\" since there are no locks and the water level rises only two feet over the entire segment. Diversions from and to adjacent natural streams along the way are used to maintain the canal's level. It runs southwest to [[City of Tonawanda|Tonawanda]], where the new alignment discharges into the Niagara River, which is navigable upstream to the [[New York Barge Canal]]'s Black Rock Lock and thence to the Canal's original \"Western Terminus\" at Buffalo's [[Erie Canal Harbor|Inner Harbor]].\n\nThe growth of railroads and highways across the state, and the opening of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]], caused commercial traffic on the canal to decline dramatically during the second half of the 20th century.\n\n===New York State Canal System===\nIn 1992, the New York State Barge Canal was renamed the [[New York State Canal System]] (including the Erie, [[Cayuga-Seneca Canal|Cayuga-Seneca]], Oswego, and Champlain canals) and placed under the newly created [[New York State Canal Corporation]], a subsidiary of the [[New York State Thruway|New York State Thruway Authority]]. While part of the Thruway, the canal system was operated using money generated by Thruway tolls.\n\n==21st century==\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2012}}\n\nSince the 1990s, the canal system has been used primarily by recreational traffic, although a small but growing amount of cargo traffic still uses it.\n\nToday, the [[Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor]] covers {{convert|524|mi|km}} of navigable water from Lake Champlain to the [[Capital District, New York|Capital Region]] and west to Buffalo. The area has a population of 2.7 million: about 75% of Central and Western New York's population lives within {{convert|25|mi|km}} of the Erie Canal.\n\nThe Erie Canal is open to small craft and some larger vessels from May through November each year. During winter, water is drained from parts of the canal for maintenance. The Champlain Canal, Lake Champlain, and the [[Chambly Canal]], and [[Richelieu River]] in Canada form the [[Lakes to Locks Passage]], making a tourist attraction of the former waterway linking eastern Canada to the Erie Canal. In 2006 recreational boating fees were eliminated to attract more visitors.\n\nTravel on the canal's middle section (particularly in the Mohawk Valley) was severely hampered by flooding in late June and early July 2006. Flood damage to the canal and its facilities was estimated as at least $15 million.\n\nThere were some 42 commercial shipments on the canal in 2008, compared to 15 such shipments in 2007 and more than 33,000 shipments in 1855, the canal's peak year. The new growth in commercial traffic is due to the rising cost of diesel fuel. Canal barges can carry a short ton of cargo {{convert|514|mi}} on one gallon of diesel fuel, while a gallon allows a train to haul the same amount of cargo {{convert|202|mi}} and a truck {{convert|59|mi}}.

It was enlarged between 1834 and 1862. The canal's peak year was 1855, when 33,000 commercial shipments took place. In 1918, the western part of the canal was enlarged to become part of the [[New York State Barge Canal]], which also extended to the Hudson River running parallel to the eastern half of the Erie Canal.\n\nIn 2000, the [[United States Congress]] designated the [[Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor]]<ref name=eriecanalway>{{cite web |url=http://www.eriecanalway.org |title=Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor |accessdate=September 25, 2012}}</ref> to recognize the national significance of the canal system as the most successful and influential human-built waterway and one of the most important works of [[civil engineering]] and construction in North America.<ref name=eriecanalway/> The canal has been mainly used by recreational watercraft since the retirement of the last large commercial ship, ''[[Day Peckinpaugh (canal motorship)|Day Peckinpaugh]]'', in 1994.

More than half of the original Erie Canal was destroyed or abandoned at the time of construction of the [[New York State Barge Canal]] in the early 20th century. The sections of the original route remaining in use, mostly west of Syracuse, were widened significantly, with bridges over the canal rebuilt and locks replaced.\n\nAt the time, it was called the Barge Canal. With the disappearance of commercial traffic and its replacement with recreational travel in the later 20th century, the original name returned, and Barge Canal is rarely used.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Erie-canal 1840 map.jpg|thumb|left|Erie Canal map c. 1840]]\nFrom the first days of the expansion of the [[Thirteen Colonies|British colonies]] from the coast of North America into the heartland of the continent, a recurring problem was that of transportation between the coastal ports and the interior. This was not unique to the Americas, and the problem still exists in those parts of the world where [[muscle power]] provides a primary means of transportation within a region. An equally ancient solution was implemented in many cultures{{spnd}}floating vessels move more easily than land vehicles since friction is significantly less. Close to the seacoast, rivers often provided adequate waterways, but the [[Appalachian Mountains]], {{convert|400|mi}} inland, running over {{convert|1500|mi}} long as a [[barrier range]] with just five places where [[Mule#Mule train|mule trains]] or [[wagon road]]s could be routed,<ref name=FiveXings>The five east\u2013west crossings of the Appalachians are: <br />{{bull\n}}Plains of Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi (around the bottom), <br />{{bull\n}}the [[Cumberland Gap]] pass connecting [[North Carolina]]/Southern [[Virginia]] with [[Kentucky]]/[[Tennessee]], <br />{{bull\n}}the [[Cumberland Narrows]] pass connecting [[Cumberland, Maryland]] (in [[Western Maryland]]) and [[Northern Virginia]] with [[West Virginia]] and [[Western Pennsylvania]] via [[Brownsville, Pennsylvania]] and the [[Monongahela River]] or the [[Youghiogheny River]] valley (both of the Ohio & Mississippi river system), <br />{{bull\n}}the [[gaps of the Allegheny]] connecting the [[Susquehanna River]] Valley in central Pennsylvania with the [[Allegheny River]] valley (and again the [[Ohio Country]]), <br />{{bull\n}}and lastly, the [[Mohawk River]] [[water gap]] and valley tributary of the [[Hudson River]], creating what later advertising would call the level water route westwards.\n\n</ref> presented a great challenge. Passengers and freight had to travel overland, a journey made more difficult by the rough condition of the roads. In 1800, it typically took 2\u00bd weeks to travel overland from New York to [[Cleveland, Ohio]], ({{convert|460|mi}}) and 4 weeks to [[Detroit]] ({{convert|612|mi}}).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://railroads.unl.edu/documents/view_document.php?id=rail.str.0241|title=Railroads and the Making of Modern America &#124; Search|website=railroads.unl.edu}}</ref>\n\nThe principal exportable product of the [[Ohio Valley]] was grain, which was a high-volume, low-priced commodity, bolstered by supplies from the coast. Frequently it was not worth the cost of transporting it to far-away population centers. This was a factor leading to farmers in the west turning their grains into [[whiskey]] for easier transport and higher sales, and later the [[Whiskey Rebellion]]. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, it became clear to coastal residents that the city or state that succeeded in developing a cheap, reliable route to the West would enjoy economic success, and the port at the seaward end of such a route would see business increase greatly.<ref>Joel Achenbach, \"America's River; From [[George Washington|Washington]] and [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]] to the Army Corps of Engineers, everyone had grandiose plans to tame the [[Potomac River|Potomac]].

The idea of a canal to tie the East Coast to the new western settlements was discussed as early as 1724: New York provincial official [[Cadwallader Colden]] made a passing reference (in a report on fur trading) to improving the natural waterways of western New York.\n\n[[Gouverneur Morris]] and [[Elkanah Watson]] were early proponents of a canal along the Mohawk River. Their efforts led to the creation of the \"Western and Northern Inland Lock Navigation Companies\" in 1792, which took the first steps to improve navigation on the Mohawk and construct a canal between the Mohawk and Lake Ontario,<ref>Calhoun, Daniel Hovey. The American civil engineer: Origins and conflict. Technology Press, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1960.</ref> but it was soon discovered that private financing was insufficient.\n[[Christopher Colles]] (who was familiar with the Bridgewater Canal) surveyed the Mohawk Valley, and made a presentation to the New York state legislature in 1784, proposing a shorter canal from [[Lake Ontario]]. The proposal drew attention and some action but was never implemented.\n\n[[Jesse Hawley (merchant)|Jesse Hawley]] had envisioned encouraging the growing of large quantities of grain on the western New York plains (then largely unsettled) for sale on the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern seaboard]]. However, he went [[bankrupt]] trying to ship grain to the coast. While in [[Canandaigua (city), New York|Canandaigua]] [[debtors' prison]], Hawley began pressing for the construction of a canal along the {{convert|90|mi|adj=on}}-long [[Mohawk River]] valley with support from [[Joseph Ellicott]] (agent for the [[Holland Land Company]] in [[Batavia (city), New York|Batavia]]). Ellicott realized that a canal would add value to the land he was selling in the western part of the state. He later became the first canal commissioner.\n\nNew York legislators became interested in the possibility of building a canal across New York in the first decade of the 19th century. Shipping goods west from Albany was a costly and tedious affair; there was no railroad yet, and to cover the distance from Buffalo to New York City by stagecoach took two weeks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/erie-canal-opens|title=Erie Canal opens|last=History.com Editors|first=|date=2019-07-27|website=HISTORY|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref>\n\n===Engineering requirements===\n\n[[File:New_York_Relief_1.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Relief map of New York State.|The [[Mohawk Valley]], running east and west, cuts a natural pathway ([[Wind gap (topography)|water gap]]) between the [[Catskill Mountains]] to the south and the [[Adirondack Mountains]] to the north]]\n\nThe Mohawk River (a tributary of the Hudson) rises near Lake Ontario and runs in a [[Quaternary glaciation|glacial meltwater]] channel just north of the [[Catskills|Catskill range]] of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], separating them from the geologically distinct [[Adirondacks]] to the north. The Mohawk and Hudson valleys form the only cut across the Appalachians north of [[Alabama]], allowing an almost complete water route from New York City in the south to Lake Ontario and Lake Erie in the west. Along its course and from these lakes, other Great Lakes, and to a lesser degree, related rivers, a large part of the continent's interior (and many settlements) would be made well connected to the Eastern seaboard.\n\nThe problem was that the land rises about {{convert|600|ft|m}} from the Hudson to Lake Erie.

There was much opposition, and the project was ridiculed as \"Clinton's folly\" and \"Clinton's ditch.\" In 1817, though, Clinton received approval from the legislature for $7 million for construction.<ref name=\"Finch\"/>\n\nThe original canal was {{convert|363|mi|km}} long, from Albany on the Hudson to Buffalo on Lake Erie.

In 1823 construction reached the [[Niagara Escarpment]], necessitating the building of five locks along a {{convert|3|mi|adj=on}} corridor to carry the canal over the escarpment. To move earth, animals pulled a \"slip scraper\" (similar to a bulldozer). The sides of the canal were lined with stone set in clay, and the bottom was also lined with clay. The stonework required hundreds of German masons, who later built many of New York's buildings.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} All labor on the canal depended upon human (and animal) power or the force of water. Engineering techniques developed during its construction included the building of [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueducts]] to redirect water; one aqueduct was {{convert|950|ft}} long to span {{convert|800|ft}} of river. As the canal progressed, the crews and engineers working on the project developed expertise and became a skilled labor force.\n\n[[File:1832 Erie Canal.jpg|thumb|center|upright=4.1|Profile of the original canal|alt=Elevation drawing of the canal's length]]\n\n===Freight boats===\n[[File:Lockport bartlett color crop.jpg|thumb|Operations at [[Lockport (city), New York|Lockport, New York]] in 1839]]\n\nCanal boats up to {{convert|3.5|ft|m}} in draft were pulled by horses and mules walking on the towpath. The canal had one towpath, generally on the north side. When [[barge|canal boats]] met, the boat with the right of way<!--How was this determined? A: good q. One would guess it was the boat traveling west as right dominates on all navigations, but one could also have afforded the bigger vessel priority, a citation is needed.--> remained on the towpath side of the canal. The other boat steered toward the berm (or heelpath) side of the canal. The driver (or \"hoggee\", pronounced HO-gee) of the privileged boat kept his towpath team by the canalside edge of the towpath, while the hoggee of the other boat moved to the outside of the towpath and stopped his team. His towline would be unhitched from the horses, go slack, fall into the water and sink to the bottom, while his boat coasted with its remaining momentum. The privileged boat's team would step over the other boat's towline, with its horses pulling the boat over the sunken towline without stopping. Once clear, the other boat's team would continue on its way.\n\nPulled by teams of horses, canal boats moved slowly, but methodically, shrinking time and distance. Efficiently, the smooth, nonstop method of transportation cut the travel time between Albany and Buffalo nearly in half, moving by day and by night. Migrants took passage on freight boats, camping on deck or on top of crates.\n\n===Passenger boats===\nPacket boats, serving passengers exclusively, reached speeds of up to five miles an hour, and ran at much more frequent intervals than the cramped, bumpy stagecoach wagons.<ref name=\"Sheriff\">{{Cite book|title=The Artificial River: The Erie Canal and the Paradox of Progress 1817\u20131862|last=Sheriff|first=Carol|publisher=Hill & Wang|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8090-2753-8|location=|url=https://archive.org/details/artificialrivere00sher|url-access=registration}}</ref>{{rp|54}} Packet boats, measuring up to 78 feet long and 14.5 feet wide, made ingenious use of space, accommodating up to 40 passengers at night and up to three times as many in the daytime.<ref name=\"Sheriff\" />{{rp|59}} The best examples, furnished with carpeted floors, stuffed chairs, and mahogany tables stocked with books and current newspapers, served as sitting rooms during the days.

At that rate, the canal would not be finished for 30 years. The main delays were caused by felling trees to clear a path through [[virgin forest]] and moving excavated soil, which took longer than expected, but the builders devised ways to solve these problems. To fell a tree, they threw rope over the top branches and winched it down. They pulled out the stumps with an innovative [[Stump harvesting|stump puller]]. Two huge wheels were mounted loose on the ends of an axle. A third wheel, slightly smaller than the others, was fixed to the center of the axle. A chain was wrapped around the axle and hooked to the stump. A rope was wrapped around the center wheel and hooked to a team of oxen. The [[mechanical advantage]] (torque) obtained ripped the stumps out of the soil. Soil to be moved was shoveled into large wheelbarrows that were dumped into mule-pulled carts. Using a scraper and a plow, a three-man team with oxen, horses and mules could build a mile in a year.<ref name = \"Hunter 1991\">{{cite book|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930, Vol. 3: The Transmission of Power |last=Hunter |first=Louis C. |authorlink= |author2=Bryant, Lynwood |year=1991 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts, London |isbn=978-0-262-08198-6 |page=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OrFHAAAAYAAJ }}</ref>\n\nThe remaining problem was finding labor; increased [[immigration]] helped fill the need.

Buffalo expended great energy to widen and deepen [[Buffalo River (New York)|Buffalo Creek]] to make it navigable and to create a harbor at its mouth. Buffalo won over Black Rock, and grew into a large city, eventually encompassing its former rival.\n\nThe entire canal was officially completed on October 26, 1825. The event was marked by a statewide \"Grand Celebration,\" culminating in a series of cannon shots along the length of the canal and the Hudson, a 90-minute [[cannonade]] from Buffalo to New York City. A flotilla of boats, led by Governor Dewitt Clinton aboard ''Seneca Chief'', sailed from Buffalo to New York City over ten days. Clinton then ceremonially poured Lake Erie water into New York Harbor to mark the \"Wedding of the Waters.\" On its return trip, ''Seneca Chief'' brought back a keg of [[Atlantic Ocean]] water, which was poured into Lake Erie by Buffalo's Judge [[Samuel Wilkeson]], who would later become mayor.\n\nThe Erie Canal was thus completed in eight years at a cost of $7.143 million<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ransom |first1=Roger |title=Canals and Development: A Discussion of the Issues |journal=American Economic Review |date=May 1964 |volume=54 |issue=3 |page=375}}</ref> ({{Inflation|US|7143000|1817|fmt=eq|r=-6}}).{{Inflation-fn|US}}  It was acclaimed as an engineering marvel that united the country and helped New York City develop as an international trade center.<ref name=\"Finch\"/>\n\n==Route==\n[[File:Erie Canal Map 1853.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|1853 Map of New York canals emboldened, center: the Erie Canal; other lines: railroads, rivers and county borders]]\n[[File:Erie canal lockport c1855.jpg|thumb|Lithograph of the Erie Canal at Lockport, New York c.1855.

At [[Cohoes, New York|Cohoes]], it climbed the escarpment on the west side of the Hudson River\u201416 locks rising {{convert|140|ft}}\u2014and then turned west along the south shore of the Mohawk River, crossing to the north side at [[Crescent, New York|Crescent]] and again to the south at [[Rexford, New York|Rexford]]. The canal continued west near the south shore of the Mohawk River all the way to Rome, where the Mohawk turns north.<ref name=\"Finch\"/>\n\nAt [[Rome, New York|Rome]], the canal continued west parallel to [[Wood Creek]], which flows westward into [[Oneida Lake]], and turned southwest and west cross-country to avoid the lake. From [[Canastota, New York|Canastota]] west, it ran roughly along the north (lower) edge of the [[Onondaga Formation|Onondaga Escarpment]], passing through Syracuse, [[Onondaga Lake]], and Rochester. Before reaching Rochester, the canal uses a series of natural ridges to cross the deep valley of [[Irondequoit Creek]]. At [[Lockport (city), New York|Lockport]] the canal turned southwest to rise to the top of the [[Niagara Escarpment]], using the ravine of [[Eighteen Mile Creek (Niagara County)|Eighteen Mile Creek]].<ref name=\"Finch\"/>\n\nThe canal continued south-southwest to [[Pendleton, New York|Pendleton]], where it turned west and southwest, mainly using the channel of [[Tonawanda Creek]]. From the [[City of Tonawanda|Tonawanda]] south toward Buffalo, it ran just east of the Niagara River, where it reached its \"Western Terminus\" at Little Buffalo Creek (later it became the [[Commercial Slip]]), which discharged into the [[Buffalo River (New York)|Buffalo River]] just above its confluence with [[Lake Erie]].<ref name=\"Finch\"/> With Buffalo's re-excavation of the Commercial Slip, completed in 2008, the Canal's original terminus is now re-watered and again accessible by boats. With several miles of the Canal inland of this location still lying under 20th-century fill and urban construction, the effective western navigable terminus of the Erie Canal is found at Tonawanda.\n\nThe Erie made use of the favorable conditions of New York's unique topography, which provided that area with the only break in the [[Appalachian mountains|Appalachians]] south of the [[Saint Lawrence River]].

Leaks developed along the entire length of the canal, but these were sealed using [[cement]] that hardened underwater ([[hydraulic cement]]). Erosion on the clay bottom proved to be a problem and the speed was limited to {{convert|4|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe original design planned for an annual tonnage of 1.5 million tons (1.36 million metric tons), but this was exceeded immediately. An ambitious program to improve the canal began in 1834. During this massive series of construction projects, known as the First Enlargement, the canal was widened from {{convert|40|to|70|ft|m}} and deepened from {{convert|4|to|7|ft|m}}. Locks were widened and/or rebuilt in new locations, and many new [[navigable aqueduct]]s were constructed. The canal was straightened and slightly re-routed in some stretches, resulting in the abandonment of short segments of the original 1825 canal. The First Enlargement was completed in 1862, with further minor enlargements in later decades.\n\nToday, the reconfiguration of the canal created during the First Enlargement is commonly referred to as the \"Improved Erie Canal\" or the \"[[Old Erie Canal State Historic Park|Old Erie Canal]]\", to distinguish it from the canal's modern-day course. Existing remains of the 1825 canal abandoned during the Enlargement are officially referred to today as \"Clinton's Ditch\" (which was also the popular nickname for the entire Erie Canal project during its original 1817\u20131825 construction).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/vinylboy20/14342144437/|title=Clintons Ditch (1)|date=June 14, 2014|via=Flickr}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Erie Canal, Lock 32.jpg|thumb|right|Upstream view of the downstream lock at Lock 32, [[Pittsford (village), New York|Pittsford, New York]]]]\n\nAdditional feeder canals soon extended the Erie Canal into a system. These included the Cayuga-Seneca Canal south to the [[Finger Lakes]], the Oswego Canal from Three Rivers north to Lake Ontario at [[Oswego, New York|Oswego]], and the Champlain Canal from [[Troy, New York|Troy]] north to Lake Champlain. From 1833 to 1877, the short Crooked Lake Canal connected [[Keuka Lake]] and [[Seneca Lake (New York)|Seneca Lake]]. The [[Chemung Canal]] connected the south end of Seneca Lake to [[Elmira, New York|Elmira]] in 1833, and was an important route for Pennsylvania [[coal]] and [[timber]] into the canal system. The [[Chenango Canal]] in 1836 connected the Erie Canal at Utica to [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]] and caused a business boom in the [[Chenango River]] valley. The Chenango and Chemung canals linked the Erie with the [[Susquehanna River]] system. The [[Black River Canal]] connected the [[Black River (New York)|Black River]] to the Erie Canal at Rome and remained in operation until the 1920s. The [[Genesee Valley Canal]] was run along the [[Genesee River]] to connect with the [[Allegheny River]] at [[Olean, New York|Olean]], but the Allegheny section, which would have connected to the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, was never built. The Genesee Valley Canal was later abandoned and became the route of the [[Genesee Valley Canal Railroad]].\n\nIn 1903 the New York State legislature authorized construction of the [[New York State Barge Canal]] as the \"Improvement of the Erie, the Oswego, the Champlain, and the Cayuga and Seneca Canals\".<ref name=\"Whiteford\">{{Cite book |title=History of the Barge Canal of New York State |last=Whiteford |first=Noble E. |year=1922 |publisher=J.

Those cities and their states started projects to compete with the Erie Canal. In Pennsylvania, the [[Main Line of Public Works]] was a combined canal and railroad running west from Philadelphia to [[Pittsburgh]] on the [[Ohio River]], opened in 1834. In Maryland, the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] ran west to [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], then a part of Virginia, also on the Ohio River, and was completed in 1853.\n\nOther competition was more direct. The [[Mohawk and Hudson Railroad]] opened in 1837, providing a bypass to the slowest part of the canal between Albany and Schenectady. Other railroads were soon chartered and built to continue the line west to Buffalo, and in 1842 a continuous line (which later became the [[New York Central Railroad]] and its [[Auburn and Syracuse Railroad#Auburn road|Auburn Road]] in 1853) was open the whole way to Buffalo. As the railroad served the same general route as the canal, but provided for faster travel, passengers soon switched to it. However, as late as 1852, the canal carried thirteen times more freight tonnage than all the railroads in New York State combined; it continued to compete well with the railroads through 1902, when tolls were abolished.\n\nDuring [[John D. Rockefeller|Rockefeller's]] consolidations of the late 1860s and early 1870s, he used the canal as a cheaper form of transportation \u2013 in the summer months when it was not frozen \u2013 to get his refined oil from Cleveland to New York City. In the winter months his only options were the three trunk lines: the [[Erie Railroad]], the [[New York Central Railroad]], or the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hawke|first=David Freeman|title=John D.

The canal also made an immense contribution to the wealth and importance of New York City, Buffalo and New York State.

Evangelical preachers made their circuits of the upstate region, and the canal served as the last leg of the Underground Railroad ferrying runaway slaves to Buffalo near the Canada\u2013US border.<ref name=\"Sheriff\" />{{rp|53}} Aspiring merchants found that tourists were reliable customers. Vendors moved from boat to boat peddling items such as books, watches and fruit, while less scrupulous \"confidence men\" sold remedies for foot corns or passed off counterfeit bills.<ref name=\"Sheriff\" />{{rp|53}} Tourists were carried along the \"northern tour,\" which ultimately led to the popular honeymoon destination Niagara Falls, just north of Buffalo.\n\nConsisting of a massive stone aqueduct which carried boats over incredible cascades, Little Falls was one of the most popular stops for American and foreign tourists. This is shown in Scene 4 of William Dunlap's play ''A Trip to Niagara'', where he depicts the general preference of tourists to travel by canal so that they could experience a combination of artificial and natural sights.<ref name=\"Sheriff\" />{{rp|55}} Canal travel was, for many, an opportunity to take in the sublime and commune with nature. The play also reflects the less enthusiastic view of some who saw movement on the canal as tedious.\n\nNew ethnic Irish communities formed in some towns along its route after completion, as Irish immigrants were a large portion of the construction labor force. Earth extracted from the canal was transported to the New York City area and used as landfill in New York and New Jersey.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} A plaque honoring the canal's construction is located in [[The Battery (Manhattan)|Battery Park]] in southern Manhattan.\n\nBecause so many immigrants traveled on the canal, many [[genealogist]]s have sought copies of canal passenger lists. Apart from the years 1827\u20131829, canal boat operators were not required to record passenger names or report them to the government, which, in this case, was the state of New York. Some passenger lists survive today in the New York State Archives, and other sources of traveler information are sometimes available.\n\nThe Canal also helped bind the still-new nation closer to Britain and Europe. Repeal of Britain's [[Corn Law]] resulted in a huge increase in exports of Midwestern wheat to Britain. Trade between the United States and Canada also increased as a result of the repeal and a reciprocity (free-trade) agreement signed in 1854. Much of this trade flowed along the Erie.\n\nIts success also prompted imitation: a rash of canal-building followed. Also, the many technical hurdles that had to be overcome made heroes of those whose innovations made the canal possible. This led to an increased public esteem for practical education. [[Chicago]], among other [[Great Lakes]] cities, recognized the importance of the canal to its economy, and two [[Chicago Loop|West Loop]] streets are named \"Canal\" and \"Clinton\" (for canal proponent DeWitt Clinton).\n\nConcern that erosion caused by logging in the [[Adirondack Mountains|Adirondacks]] could silt up the canal contributed to the creation in 1885 of another New York National Historic Landmark, the [[Adirondack Park]].\n\n[[File:Erie Canal Lift Bridge Lockport July 2010.JPG|thumb|right|Two \"low\" lift bridges in [[Lockport, New York]] July 2010]]\nMany notable authors wrote about the canal, including [[Herman Melville]], [[Frances Trollope]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Samuel Hopkins Adams]] and the [[Marquis de Lafayette]], and many tales and songs were written about life on the canal.

Allen]] was written in 1905 to memorialize the canal's early heyday, when barges were pulled by mules rather than engines.\n\n==Sunday closing debate==\nThe New York State Legislature debated closing the locks of the Erie Canal on Sundays, when they convened in 1858. However, George Jeremiah and Dwight Bacheller, two of the bill's opponents, argued that the state had no right to stop canal traffic on the grounds that the Erie Canal and its tributaries had ceased to be wards of the state. The canal at its inception had been imagined as an extension of nature, an artificial river where there had been none. The canal succeeded by sharing more in common with lakes and seas than it had with public roads. Jeremiah and Bacheller argued, successfully, that just as it was unthinkable to halt oceangoing navigation on Sunday, it was so with the canal.<ref name=\"Sheriff\" />{{rp|172}}\n\n==20th century==\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2013}}\n[[File:BaldwinsvilleLock24.jpg|thumb|right|<!--max img sz-->The modern Erie Canal has 34 locks, which are painted with the blue and gold colors of the [[New York State Canal System]]]]\nIn 1918, the Canal was replaced by the larger [[New York State Canal System|New York State Barge Canal]]. This new canal replaced much of the original route, leaving many abandoned sections (most notably between Syracuse and Rome). New digging and flood control technologies allowed engineers to [[river engineering|canalize]] rivers that the original canal had sought to avoid, such as the Mohawk, [[Seneca River (New York)|Seneca]], and [[Clyde River (New York)|Clyde]] rivers, and Oneida Lake. In sections that did not consist of canalized rivers<ref name=\"Whiteford\" /> (particularly between Rochester and Buffalo), the original Erie Canal channel was enlarged to {{convert|120|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|12|ft|m}} deep. The expansion allowed barges up to {{convert|2000|ST|t}} to use the Canal. This expensive project was politically unpopular in parts of the state not served by the canal, and failed to save it from becoming obsolete for commercial shipping.\n\nThe new alignment began on the Hudson River at the border between Cohoes and [[Waterford, New York|Waterford]], where it ran northwest with five locks (the so-called \"Waterford Flight\"), running into the Mohawk River east of [[Crescent, New York|Crescent]]. The Waterford Flight is claimed to be one of the steepest series of locks in the world.<ref name=ASCE-RPI>{{cite web|title=Dedication of the Flight of Five Locks as a Civil Engineering Landmark (9/9/2012) |url=http://rpiasce.weebly.com/recent-asce-events.html |work=ASCE Rennselaer |publisher=American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), RPI Chapter |accessdate=March 2, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216071318/http://rpiasce.weebly.com/recent-asce-events.html |archivedate=December 16, 2013 }}</ref><!-- Previous interim reference should be improved --><ref name=\"Finch\" />{{rp|19}}<ref name=\"Williams\" />{{rp|267}}\n\n[[File:Sunset over the Erie Canal in North Tonawanda, NY..jpg|thumb|left|Gateway Harbor in [[North Tonawanda, New York|North Tonawanda]], about 1000 feet from the present day western terminus of the Erie Canal where it connects to the Niagara River]]\n\nWhile the old Canal ran next to the Mohawk all the way to Rome, the new canal ran through the river, which was straightened or widened where necessary.<ref name=\"Finch\" />{{rp|13}} At [[Ilion, New York|Ilion]], the new canal left the river for good, but continued to run on a new alignment parallel to both the river and the old canal to Rome. From Rome, the new route continued almost due west, merging with [[Fish Creek (New York)|Fish Creek]] just east of its entry into Oneida Lake.<ref name=\"ECAsystem\" />\n\nFrom Oneida Lake, the new canal ran west along the [[Oneida River]], with cutoffs to shorten the route. At [[Three Rivers, New York|Three Rivers]] the Oneida River turns northwest, and was deepened for the Oswego Canal to Lake Ontario. The new Erie Canal turned south there along the Seneca River, which turns west near Syracuse and continues west to a point in the [[Montezuma Marsh]]. There the Cayuga and Seneca Canal continued south with the Seneca River, and the new Erie Canal again ran parallel to the old canal along the bottom of the Niagara Escarpment, in some places running along the Clyde River, and in some places replacing the old canal. At [[Pittsford (village), New York|Pittsford]], southeast of Rochester, the canal turned west to run around the south side of Rochester, rather than through downtown. The canal crosses the [[Genesee River]] at the [[Genesee Valley Park]], then rejoins the old path near [[North Gates, New York|North Gates]].\n\nFrom there it was again roughly an upgrade to the original canal, running west to Lockport.<ref name=\"NYPA\" /> This reach of 64.2 miles from Henrietta to Lockport is called \"the 60\u2011mile level\" since there are no locks and the water level rises only two feet over the entire segment. Diversions from and to adjacent natural streams along the way are used to maintain the canal's level. It runs southwest to [[City of Tonawanda|Tonawanda]], where the new alignment discharges into the Niagara River, which is navigable upstream to the [[New York Barge Canal]]'s Black Rock Lock and thence to the Canal's original \"Western Terminus\" at Buffalo's [[Erie Canal Harbor|Inner Harbor]].\n\nThe growth of railroads and highways across the state, and the opening of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]], caused commercial traffic on the canal to decline dramatically during the second half of the 20th century.\n\n===New York State Canal System===\nIn 1992, the New York State Barge Canal was renamed the [[New York State Canal System]] (including the Erie, [[Cayuga-Seneca Canal|Cayuga-Seneca]], Oswego, and Champlain canals) and placed under the newly created [[New York State Canal Corporation]], a subsidiary of the [[New York State Thruway|New York State Thruway Authority]]. While part of the Thruway, the canal system was operated using money generated by Thruway tolls.\n\n==21st century==\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2012}}\n\nSince the 1990s, the canal system has been used primarily by recreational traffic, although a small but growing amount of cargo traffic still uses it.\n\nToday, the [[Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor]] covers {{convert|524|mi|km}} of navigable water from Lake Champlain to the [[Capital District, New York|Capital Region]] and west to Buffalo. The area has a population of 2.7 million: about 75% of Central and Western New York's population lives within {{convert|25|mi|km}} of the Erie Canal.\n\nThe Erie Canal is open to small craft and some larger vessels from May through November each year. During winter, water is drained from parts of the canal for maintenance. The Champlain Canal, Lake Champlain, and the [[Chambly Canal]], and [[Richelieu River]] in Canada form the [[Lakes to Locks Passage]], making a tourist attraction of the former waterway linking eastern Canada to the Erie Canal. In 2006 recreational boating fees were eliminated to attract more visitors.\n\nTravel on the canal's middle section (particularly in the Mohawk Valley) was severely hampered by flooding in late June and early July 2006. Flood damage to the canal and its facilities was estimated as at least $15 million.\n\nThere were some 42 commercial shipments on the canal in 2008, compared to 15 such shipments in 2007 and more than 33,000 shipments in 1855, the canal's peak year. The new growth in commercial traffic is due to the rising cost of diesel fuel. Canal barges can carry a short ton of cargo {{convert|514|mi}} on one gallon of diesel fuel, while a gallon allows a train to haul the same amount of cargo {{convert|202|mi}} and a truck {{convert|59|mi}}. Canal barges can carry loads up to {{convert|3000|ST|LT}}, and are used to transport objects that would be too large for road or rail shipment.<ref name=\"NYTimes\" /> Today, the system is served by several commercial towing companies.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.canals.ny.gov/business/shipping.html |title=Commercial Shipping and Towing - New York State Canals |website=www.canals.ny.gov |access-date=2019-01-24}}</ref> In 2012, the [[New York State Canal System]] (which consists of the Erie Canal and a few smaller canals) was used to ship 42,000 tons of cargo.<ref name = \"Benefit Report\">New York State Canal Corporation, [http://www.canals.ny.gov/economic-benefit-report.pdf Report on Economic Benefits of Non\u2010Tourism Use of the NYS Canal System]</ref>\n\n{|\n|-\n| [[File:Erie Canal over Genesee River RochNY.jpg|thumb|upright|Erie Canal Aqueduct crossing the [[Genesee River]] in [[Rochester, New York]].

Calves are born after a [[gestation]] period of up to nearly two years.<ref name=Macdonald /> The calves are cared for by their mother and other young females in the group, known as [[allomothering]].<ref name=Douglas-Hamilton1972/>\n\nAfrican elephants show [[sexual dimorphism]] in weight and shoulder height by age 20, due to the rapid early growth of males. By age 25, males are double the weight of females; however, both sexes continue to grow throughout their lives.\n\nFemale African elephants are able to start reproducing at around 10 to 12 years of age,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Benedict |first=F. G. |title=The physiology of the elephant |year=1936 |journal=Carnegie Inst. Washington Pub. No. 474 |volume=1}}</ref> and are in estrus for about 2 to 7 days. They do not mate at a specific time; however, they are less likely to reproduce in times of drought than when water is plentiful. The gestation period of an elephant is 22 months and fertile females usually give birth every 3\u20136 years, so if they live to around 50 years of age, they may produce 7 offspring. Females are a scarce and mobile resource for the males so there is intense competition to gain access to estrous females.\n\nPost sexual maturity, males begin to experience [[musth]], a physical and behavioral condition that is characterized by elevated testosterone, aggression and more sexual activity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hollister-Smith |first1=J.

Males sire few offspring in periods when they are not in musth. During the middle of estrus, female elephants look for males in musth to guard them. The females will yell, in a loud, low way to attract males from far away. Male elephants can also smell the hormones of a female ready for breeding. This leads males to compete with each other to mate, which results in the females mating with older, healthier males.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Poole |first=Joyce H. |title=Mate guarding, reproductive success and female choice in African elephants |journal=Animal Behaviour |year=1989 |volume=37 |pages=842\u2013849 |doi=10.1016/0003-3472(89)90068-7}}</ref> Females choose to a point who they mate with, since they are the ones who try to get males to compete to guard them.

Less than a third of the population of female elephants will be in estrus at any given time and gestation period of an elephant is long, so it makes more evolutionary sense for a male to search for as many females as possible rather than stay with one group.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n== Threats ==\n[[File:Ivory trade.jpg|thumb|upright|Men with African elephant tusks in [[Dar es Salaam]], {{Circa|1900|lk=yes}}]]\nBased on vegetation types that provide suitable habitat for African elephants, it was estimated that in the early 19th century a maximum of 26,913,000 African elephants might have been present from the [[Sahel]] in the north to the [[Highveld]] in the south.
