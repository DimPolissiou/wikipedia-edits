Traditionally known in French (an official language of the Yukon territory) as '''La ru\u00e9e vers l'or du Klondike'''.}} was a [[Human migration|migration]] by an estimated 100,000 prospectors to the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike region]] of the [[Yukon]], in north-western [[Canada]], between 1896 and 1899. [[Gold]] was discovered there by local miners on August 16, 1896, and, when news reached [[Seattle]] and [[San Francisco]] the following year, it triggered a stampede of prospectors. Some became wealthy, but the majority went in vain. It has been immortalized in artifacts, films, games, literature, and photographs.\n\nTo reach the gold fields, most prospectors took the route through the ports of [[Dyea, Alaska|Dyea]] and [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]], in [[Southeast Alaska]]. Here, the Klondikers could follow either the [[Chilkoot Trail|Chilkoot]] or the [[White Pass Trail|White Pass]] trails to the [[Yukon River]], and sail down to the Klondike. The Canadian authorities required each of them to bring a year's supply of food, in order to prevent starvation. In all, the Klondikers' equipment weighed close to a ton, which most carried themselves, in stages. Performing this task, and contending with the mountainous terrain and cold climate, meant those who persisted did not arrive until summer 1898. Once there, they found few opportunities, and many left disappointed.\n\nMining was challenging, as the ore was distributed unevenly, and [[permafrost]] made\ndigging slow. Consequently, some miners chose to buy and sell [[Land claim|claims]], build up huge investments, and let others do the work. \n\nTo accommodate the prospectors, [[Boomtown|boom towns]] sprang up along the routes. At their terminus, [[Dawson City]] was founded at the confluence of the Klondike and the Yukon Rivers. From a population of 500 in 1896, the town grew to house approximately 30,000 people by summer 1898. Built of wood, isolated, and unsanitary, Dawson suffered from fires, high prices, and epidemics. \n\nDespite this, the wealthiest prospectors spent extravagantly, gambling and drinking in the [[Western saloon|saloons]]. The Native [[H\u00e4n people]], on the other hand, suffered from the rush; they were forcibly moved into a [[Indian reserve|reserve]] to make way for the stampeders, and many died.\n\nFrom 1898, the newspapers that had encouraged so many to travel to the Klondike lost interest in it. In the summer of 1899, [[Nome Gold Rush|gold was discovered around Nome]] in west [[Alaska]], and many prospectors left the Klondike for the new goldfields, marking the end of the Klondike Rush. The boom towns declined, and the population of Dawson City fell. \n\nGold mining production in the Klondike peaked in 1903, after heavier equipment was brought in. Since then, the Klondike has been mined on and off, and today the legacy draws tourists to the region and contributes to its prosperity.{{refn | group = n |An estimated {{convert|14000000|oz}} of gold has been taken from the area (until 2013) of which half came from Bonanza Creek, and a quarter from Hunker Creek.<ref name=CSWA/>}}\n\n==Background==\n[[FIle:Tlingit-map-modify.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|alt=Map of people and places at the time of discovery of gold in the [[Yukon]].|Yukon at the time of discovery.]]\n\nThe [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|indigenous peoples in north-west America]] had traded in [[copper]] nuggets prior to [[Age of Discovery|European expansion]].

Of these, no more than 4,000 struck gold and only a few hundred became rich.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=396}} By the time most of the stampeders arrived in 1898, the best creeks had all been claimed, either by the long-term miners in the region, or by the first arrivals of the year before.{{sfn|Allen|2007|p=3}} The Bonanza, Eldorado, Hunker and Dominion Creeks were all taken, with almost 10,000 claims recorded by the authorities by July 1898; a new prospector would have to look further afield to find a claim of his own.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|pp=154, 165}}\n\nGeologically, the region was permeated with veins of gold, forced to the surface by [[volcano|volcanic]] action and then worn away by the action of rivers and streams, leaving nuggets and gold dust in deposits known as [[placer gold]].{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=1}}{{refn | group = n |Often most of the gold will be left in uneroded quartz ores, called mother lodes; however, at Klondike a mother lode has never been found.<ref name=CSWA/>}} Some ores lay along the creek beds in lines of soil, typically {{convert|15|ft}} to {{convert|30|ft}} beneath the surface.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|pp=158\u2013160}} Others, formed by even older streams, lay along the hilltops; these deposits were called \"bench gold\".{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=158}} Finding the gold was challenging. Initially, miners had assumed that all the gold would be along the existing creeks, and it was not until late in 1897 that the hilltops began to be mined.{{sfn|Berton|2001|pp=179\u2013180}} Gold was also unevenly distributed in the areas where it was found, which made prediction of good mining sites even more uncertain.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|pp=158\u2013159}} The only way to be certain that gold was present was to conduct exploratory digging.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=160}}\n\n=== Methods ===\n{{See also|Mining methods of the Klondike Gold Rush}}\n[[File:Underground-mining-klondike.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Photograph of miners|Mining in a shaft, 1898.]]\n\nMining began with clearing the ground of vegetation and debris.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=159}} Prospect holes were then dug in an attempt to find the ore or \"pay streak\".{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=159}} If these holes looked productive, proper digging could commence, aiming down to the bedrock, where the majority of the gold was found.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=159}} The digging would be carefully monitored in case the operation needed to be shifted to allow for changes in the flow.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=159}}\n\nIn the sub-Arctic climate of the Klondike, a layer of hard permafrost lay only {{convert|6|ft}} below the surface.{{sfn|Allen|2007|p=11}}{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=169}} Traditionally, this had meant that mining in the region only occurred during the summer months, but the pressure of the gold rush made such a delay unacceptable.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=160}} Late 19th century technology existed for dealing with this problem, including hydraulic mining and stripping, and [[Gold dredge|dredging]], but the heavy equipment required for this could not be brought into the Klondike during the gold rush.{{sfn|Allen|2007|p=11}}{{sfn|Morse|2003|p=92}}\n\nInstead, the miners relied on wood fires to soften the ground to a depth of about {{convert|14|in}} and then removing the resulting gravel. The process was repeated until the gold was reached. In theory, no support of the shaft was necessary because of the permafrost although in practice sometimes the fire melted the permafrost and caused collapses.{{sfn|Morse|2003|p=99}} Fires could also produce noxious gases, which had to be removed by bellows or other tools.{{sfn|The Chicago Record|1897|p=17}}{{sfn|Allen|2007|pp=11\u201312}} The resulting \"dirt\" brought out of the mines froze quickly in winter and could be processed only during the warmer summer months.{{sfn|Allen|2007|pp=11\u201312}}{{refn| group = n | In the summer, the sunshine would slowly thaw exposed permafrost at around the rate of {{convert|2|ft}} every 12 hours; some miners felt this too slow, and used burning techniques during the summer months as well.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=169}}}} An alternative, more efficient, approach called steam thawing was devised between 1897 and 1898; this used a furnace to pump steam directly into the ground, but since it required additional equipment it was not a widespread technique during the years of the rush.{{sfn|Adney|1994|p=419}}\n\n[[File:Thawing-eldorado-creek-1898.jpg|thumb|Thawing with steam, 1898]]\nIn the summer, water would be used to sluice and pan the dirt, separating out the heavier gold from gravel.{{sfn|Allen|2007|p=12}} This required miners to construct sluices, which were sequences of wooden boxes {{convert|15|ft}} long, through which the dirt would be washed; up to 20 of these might be needed for each mining operation.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=170}} The sluices in turn required lots of water, usually produced by creating a dam and ditches or crude pipes.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=172}} \"Bench gold\" mining on the hill sides could not use sluice lines because water could not be pumped that high up. Instead, these mines used rockers, boxes that moved back and forth like a cradle, to create the motion needed for separation.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=171}} Finally, the resulting gold dust could be exported out of the Klondike; exchanged for paper money at the rate of $16 ($430) per troy ounce (ozt)<!--gold is measured in troy ounces--> through one of the major banks that opened in Dawson City, or simply used as money when dealing with local traders.{{sfn|Berton|2001|pp=288\u2013289}}{{refn| group = n | Only pure gold dust was bought by banks the rate being $16 ($430) per oz. \"Commercial dust\", still containing black sand, was bought by banks at $11 ($300) per oz. Local traders accepted commercial dust at the pure dust rate, but made up for this by under weighing.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=289}} }}\n\n=== Business ===\n\nSuccessful mining took time and capital, particularly once most of the timber around the Klondike had been cut down.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=172}} A realistic mining operation required $1,500 ($42,000) for wood to be burned to melt the ground, along with around $1,000 ($28,000) to construct a dam, $1,500 ($42,000) for ditches and up to $600 ($16,800) for sluice boxes, a total of $4,600.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=172}} The attraction of the Klondike to a prospector, however, was that when gold was found, it was often highly concentrated.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=236}} Some of the creeks in the Klondike were fifteen times richer in gold than those in [[California Gold Rush|California]], and richer still than those in [[Witwatersrand Gold Rush|South Africa]].{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=236}} In just two years, for example, $230,000 ($6,440,000) worth of gold was brought up from claim 29 on the Eldorado Creek.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=168}}{{refn | group = n |The claim belonged to the Swedish miner Charlie Anderson known as the \"Lucky Swede\", who bought it unproved while too drunk to remember.

Should the prospector leave the claim for more than three days without good reason, another miner could make a claim on the land.{{sfn|Allen|2007|p=9}} The Canadian government also charged a [[Royalties|royalty]] of between 10 and 20 percent on the value of gold taken from a claim.{{sfn|The Chicago Record|1897|p=148}}\n\nTraditionally, a mining claim had been granted over a {{convert|500|ft|adj=on}} long stretch of a creek, including the land from one side of the valley to another. The Canadian authorities had tried to reduce this length to {{convert|150|ft}}, but under pressure from miners had been forced to agree to {{convert|250|ft}}. The only exception to this was a \"Discovery\" claim, the first to be made on a  creek, which could be {{convert|500|ft}} long.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|pp=181\u2013182}}{{refn| group = n | Despite the tensions over the sizes of claims in the Klondike, the position of miners was in fact more secure than in the California Gold Rush of 1848\u201352, where an influx of prospectors could lead to a reduction in size of existing claims.{{sfn|Allen|2007|p=15}}}} The exact lengths of claims were often challenged and when the government [[Surveying|surveyor]] [[William Ogilvie (surveyor)|William Ogilvie]] conducted surveys to settle disputes, he found some claims exceeded the official limit.{{sfn|Berton|2001|pp=72\u201374}} The excess fractions of land then became available as claims and were sometimes quite valuable.{{sfn|Berton|2001|pp=72\u201374}}\n\nClaims could be bought. However, their price depended on whether they had been yet proved to contain gold.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=165}} A prospector with capital might consider taking a risk on an \"unproved\" claim on one of the better creeks for $5,000 ($140,000); a wealthier miner could buy a \"proved\" mine for $50,000 ($1,400,000).{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=165}} The well known claim eight on Eldorado Creek was sold for as much as $350,000 ($9,800,000).{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=165}} Prospectors were also allowed to hire others to work for them.{{sfn|Allen|2007|pp=14\u201315}} Enterprising miners such as [[Alex McDonald (prospector)|Alex McDonald]] set about amassing mines and employees.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=78}} [[Leverage (finance)|Leveraging]] his acquisitions with short term loans, by the autumn of 1897 McDonald had purchased 28 claims, estimated to be worth millions.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=78}} [[Bill Gates (frontiersman)|Swiftwater Bill Gates]] famously borrowed heavily against his claim on the Eldorado creek, relying on hired hands to mine the gold to keep up his interest payments.{{sfn|Berton|2001|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nThe less fortunate or less well funded prospectors rapidly found themselves destitute. Some chose to sell their equipment and return south.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=173}} Others took jobs as manual workers, either in mines or in Dawson; the typical daily pay of $15 ($410) was high by external standards, but low compared to the cost of living in the Klondike.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=173}} The possibility that a new creek might suddenly produce gold, however, continued to tempt poorer prospectors.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=173}} Smaller stampedes around the Klondike continued throughout the gold rush, when rumours <!--rumors--> of new strikes would cause a small mob to descend on fresh sites, hoping to be able to stake out a high value claim.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=174}}\n\n== Life in the Klondike ==\nThe massive influx of prospectors drove the formation of boom towns along the routes of the stampede, with Dawson City in the Klondike the largest.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=139}}{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=140}} The new towns were crowded, often chaotic and many disappeared just as soon as they came.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=354}} Most stampeders were men but women also travelled<!-- US: traveled --> to the region, typically as the wife of a prospector.{{sfn|Porsild|1998|p=20}} Some women entertained in gambling and dance halls built by business men and women who were encouraged by the lavish spending of successful miners.{{sfn|Berton|2001|pp=352\u2013253}}\n\nDawson remained relatively lawful, protected by the Canadian NWMP, which meant that gambling and prostitution were accepted while robbery and murder were kept low. By contrast, especially the port of Skagway under US jurisdiction in Southeast Alaska became infamous for its criminal underworld.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=142}}{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=306}} The extreme climate and remoteness of the region in general meant that supplies and communication with the outside world including news and mail were scarce.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=140}}{{sfn|Allen|2007|p=8}}\n\n=== Boomtowns ===\n[[File:Skagway-view-1898-2.jpg|thumb|right|alt=View of Skagway, 1898|View of Skagway, 1898]]\n\nThe ports of Dyea and Skagway, through which most of the prospectors entered, were tiny settlements before the gold rush, each consisting of only one log cabin.{{sfn|Berton|2001|pp=134\u2013135}} Because there were no [[wharf|docking facilities]], ships had to unload their cargo directly onto the beach, where people tried to move their goods before high tide.{{sfn|Berton|2001|pp=137\u2013138}} Inevitably [[cargos]] were lost in the process.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=137}} Some travellers had arrived intending to supply goods and services to the would-be miners; some of these in turn, realizing how difficult it would be to reach Dawson, chose to do the same.{{sfn|Berton|2001|pp=137\u2013138}} Within weeks, storehouses, saloons, and offices lined the muddy streets of Dyea and Skagway, surrounded by tents and [[wiktionary:hovel|hovels]].{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=139}}\n\nSkagway became famous in international media; the author [[John Muir]] described the town as \"a nest of ants taken into a strange country and stirred up by a stick\".{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=137}} While Dyea remained a transit point throughout the winter, Skagway began to take on a more permanent character.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=145}} Skagway also built wharves out into the bay in order to attract a greater share of the prospectors.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=98}} The town was effectively lawless, dominated by drinking, gunfire and prostitution.{{sfn|Berton|2001|pp=148\u2013149}} The visiting NWMP Superintendent [[Sam Steele]] noted that it was \"little better than a hell on earth&nbsp;... about the roughest place in the world\".{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=149}} Nonetheless, by the summer of 1898, with a population\u2014including migrants\u2014of between 15,000 and 20,000, Skagway was the largest city in Alaska.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=99}}\n\nIn late summer 1897 Skagway and Dyea fell under the control of [[Soapy Smith|Jefferson Randolph \"Soapy\" Smith]] and his men, who arrived from Seattle shortly after Skagway began to expand.{{sfn|Smith|2009|p=532}}{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=150}} He was an American [[Confidence trick|confidence man]] whose gang, 200 to 300 strong, cheated and stole from the prospectors travelling through the region.{{sfn|Berton|2001|pp=150\u2013151, 153, 331}}{{refn | group = n |By region is meant from the ships that sailed along the west coast to the Canada\u2013US border at the Chilkoot and White Pass.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=chp. 5.4}}}} He maintained the illusion of being an upstanding member of the community, opening three saloons as well as creating fake businesses to assist in his operations.{{sfn|Smith|2009|pp=454\u2013455}}{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=152}} One of his scams was a fake [[Telegraphy|telegraph office]] charging to send messages all over the US and Canada, often pretending to receive a reply.{{sfn|Berton|2001|pp=152\u2013153}} Opposition to Smith steadily grew and, after weeks of [[vigilante]] activity, he was killed in Skagway during the [[shootout on Juneau Wharf]] on July 8, 1898.{{sfn|Smith|2009|p=532}}{{sfn|Berton|2001|pp=327\u2013329}}\n\nOther towns also boomed.

During the first months of the stampede in 1897, it was said that no news was too old to be read. In the lack of newspapers, some prospectors would read can labels until they knew them by heart.{{sfn|The Chicago Record|1897|p=274}} The following year, two teams fought their way over the passes to reach Dawson City first, complete with [[printing-press]]es, with the aim of gaining control of the newspaper market.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=274}} Gene Kelly, the editor of the ''Klondike Nugget'' arrived first, but without his equipment, and it was the team behind the ''Midnight Sun'' who produced the first daily newspaper in Dawson.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=274}}{{sfn|Macdonald|O'Keefe|1996|pp=13\u201314}}{{sfn|Alia|1999|p=125}} The ''Dawson Miner'' followed shortly after, bringing the number of daily newspapers in the town during the gold rush up to three.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=150}} The ''Nugget'' sold for $24 ($680) as an annual subscription, and became well known for championing miners and for its lucid coverage of scandals.{{sfn|Macdonald|O'Keefe|1996|p=15}} Paper was often hard to find and during the winter of 1898\u201399, the ''Nugget'' had to be printed on butcher's wrapping paper.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=390}} News could also be told. In June, 1898, a prospector bought an edition of the [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] at an auction and charged spectators a dollar each to have it read aloud in one of Dawson's halls.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=chp. 10.1}}\n\nMail service was chaotic during the stampede.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=313}} Apart from the number of prospectors, two major obstacles stood in its way.

From here it was then distributed by the [[United States Post Office Department|US Post Office]] back up to Dawson.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=314}} The huge distances involved resulted in delays of several months and frequently the loss of protective envelopes and their addresses.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=314}} The second problem was in Dawson itself, which initially lacked a post office and therefore relied on two stores and a saloon to act as informal delivery points.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=314}} The NWMP were tasked to run the mail system by October 1897, but they were ill-trained to do so.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=314}} Up to 5,700 letters might arrive in a single shipment, all of which had to be collected in person from the post office. This resulted in huge queues, with claimants lining up outside the office for up to three days.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=314}} Those who had no time and could afford it would pay others to stand in line for them, preferably a woman since they were allowed to get ahead in line out of politeness.{{sfn|Adney|1994|p=434}} Postage stamps, like paper in general, were scarce and rationed to two per customer.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=314}} By 1899, trained postal staff took over mail delivery and relieved the NWMP of this task.{{sfn|Ross|May|1988|p=16}}\n\n=== Role of women ===\n[[File:Actresses travelling on the Klondike Gold Rush.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of actresses|Actresses travelling to Dawson, 1898]]\nIn 1898 eight percent of those living in the Klondike territory were women, and in towns like Dawson this rose to 12 percent.{{sfn|Porsild|1998|p=20}} Many women arrived with their husbands or families, but others travelled<!-- US: traveled --> alone.{{sfn|Porsild|1998|p=194}} Most came to the Klondike for similar economic and social reasons as male prospectors, but they attracted particular media interest.{{sfn|Backhouse|1995|pp=14\u201315}} The gender imbalance in the Klondike encouraged business proposals to ship young, single women into the region to marry newly wealthy miners; few, if any, of these marriages ever took place, but some single women appear to have travelled<!-- US: traveled --> on their own in the hope of finding prosperous husbands.{{sfn|Backhouse|1995|pp=58\u201361}} Guidebooks gave recommendations for what practical clothes women should take to the Klondike: the female dress code of the time was formal, emphasising <!--US: emphasizing--> long skirts and corsets, but most women adapted this for the conditions of the trails.{{sfn|Backhouse|1995|pp=16\u201318}} Regardless of experience, women in a party were typically expected to cook for the group.{{sfn|Backhouse|1995|p=22}} Few mothers brought their children with them to the Klondike, due to the risks of the travel and the remote location.{{sfn|Backhouse|1995|pp=50\u201351}}\n\nOnce in the Klondike, very few women\u2014less than one percent\u2014actually worked as miners.{{sfn|Porsild|1998|pp=84, 87}} Many were married to miners; however, their lives as partners on the gold fields were still hard and often lonely.

In August 1898, gold had been found at [[Atlin, British Columbia|Atlin Lake]] at the head of the Yukon River, generating a flurry of interest, but during the winter of 1898\u201399 much larger quantities were found [[Nome Gold Rush|at Nome]] at the mouth of the Yukon.{{sfn|Allen|2007|p=3}}{{sfn|Berton|2001|pp=391\u2013392}}{{sfn|Harvey|1999|p=155}} In 1899, a flood of prospectors from across the region left for Nome, 8,000 from Dawson alone during a single week in August.{{sfn|Allen|2007|p=3}}{{sfn|Berton|2001|pp=391\u2013392}} The Klondike gold rush was over.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=393}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n=== People ===\n[[File:Jim Mason plaque.jpg|thumb|Plaque to Skookum Jim, Yukon, 2005]]\n\nOnly a handful of the 100,000 people who left for the Klondike during the gold rush became rich.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=396}} They typically spent $1,000 ($27,000) each reaching the region, which when combined exceeded what was produced from the gold fields between 1897 and 1901.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=412}} At the same time, most of those who did find gold lost their fortunes in the subsequent years.{{sfn|Berton|2001|pp=396\u2013397}} They often died penniless, attempting to reproduce their earlier good fortune in fresh mining opportunities.{{sfn|Berton|2001|pp=396\u2013397}} Businessman and miner Alex McDonald, for example, continued to accumulate land after the boom until his money ran out; he died in poverty, still prospecting.

George Carmack left his wife Kate\u2014who had found it difficult to adapt to their new lifestyle\u2014remarried and lived in relative prosperity; Skookum Jim had a huge income from his mining royalties but refused to settle and continued to prospect until his death in 1916; Dawson Charlie spent lavishly and died in an alcohol-related accident.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=406}}{{refn|group = n|Robert Henderson, the prospector who gave the discoverers the idea to look for gold at Klondike River, was ill for much of the rush, but was later awarded $200 ($5,400) a month for life by the Canadian government for his part of the discovery.{{sfn|Mole|2009|p=134}}{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=149}}}}\n\nThe richest of the Klondike saloon owners, businessmen and gamblers also typically lost their fortunes and died in poverty.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=401}} Gene Allen, for example, the editor of the ''Klondike Nugget'', became [[bankrupt]] and spent the rest of his career in smaller newspapers; the prominent gambler and saloon owner Sam Bonnifield suffered a [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]] and died in extreme poverty.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=401}} Nonetheless, some of those who joined the gold rush prospered.

Service created well-known poems about the gold rush, among them ''[[Songs of a Sourdough]]'', one of the bestselling books of poetry in the first decade of the 20th century, along with his novel, ''The Trail of '98'', which was written by hand on wallpaper in one of Dawson's log cabins.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=132}}{{sfn|Berton|1974|p=71}}{{sfn|Cameron|1997|pp=95\u201396}} The Canadian historian [[Pierre Berton]] grew up in Dawson where his father had been a prospector, and wrote several historical books about the gold rush, such as ''The Last Great Gold Rush''.{{sfn|Berton|2001|pp=424\u2013425}} The experiences of the Irish [[Mic\u00ed Mac Gabhann]] resulted the posthumous work ''Rotha M\u00f3r an tSaoil'' (translated into English as ''The Hard Road to Klondike'' in 1962), a vivid description of the period.{{sfn|Bowden|2008|pp=532\u2013533}}\n\nSome terminology from the stampede made its way into North American English like \"[[wikt:cheechako|Cheechakos]]\", referring to newly arrived miners, and \"[[wikt:sourdough|Sourdoughs]]\", experienced miners.{{sfn|Porsild|1998|pp=15\u201316}}{{refn | group = n | Jack London famously captured the origins of these terms, describing how \"the men who came ashore from the steamers were newcomers.

Traditionally known in French (an official language of the Yukon territory) as '''La ru\u00e9e vers l'or du Klondike'''.}} was a [[Human migration|migration]] by an estimated 100,000 prospectors to the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike region]] of the [[Yukon]], in north-western [[Canada]], between 1896 and 1899. [[Gold]] was discovered there by local miners on August 16, 1896, and, when news reached [[Seattle]] and [[San Francisco]] the following year, it triggered a stampede of prospectors. Some became wealthy, but the majority went in vain. It has been immortalized in artifacts, films, games, literature, and photographs.\n\nTo reach the gold fields, most prospectors took the route through the ports of [[Dyea, Alaska|Dyea]] and [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]], in [[Southeast Alaska]]. Here, the Klondikers could follow either the [[Chilkoot Trail|Chilkoot]] or the [[White Pass Trail|White Pass]] trails to the [[Yukon River]], and sail down to the Klondike. The Canadian authorities required each of them to bring a year's supply of food, in order to prevent starvation. In all, the Klondikers' equipment weighed close to a ton, which most carried themselves, in stages. Performing this task, and contending with the mountainous terrain and cold climate, meant those who persisted did not arrive until summer 1898. Once there, they found few opportunities, and many left disappointed.\n\nMining was challenging, as the ore was distributed unevenly, and [[permafrost]] made\ndigging slow. Consequently, some miners chose to buy and sell [[Land claim|claims]], build up huge investments, and let others do the work. \n\nTo accommodate the prospectors, [[Boomtown|boom towns]] sprang up along the routes. At their terminus, [[Dawson City]] was founded at the confluence of the Klondike and the Yukon Rivers. From a population of 500 in 1896, the town grew to house approximately 30,000 people by summer 1898. Built of wood, isolated, and unsanitary, Dawson suffered from fires, high prices, and epidemics. \n\nDespite this, the wealthiest prospectors spent extravagantly, gambling and drinking in the [[Western saloon|saloons]]. The Native [[H\u00e4n people]], on the other hand, suffered from the rush; they were forcibly moved into a [[Indian reserve|reserve]] to make way for the stampeders, and many died.\n\nFrom 1898, the newspapers that had encouraged so many to travel to the Klondike lost interest in it. In the summer of 1899, [[Nome Gold Rush|gold was discovered around Nome]] in west [[Alaska]], and many prospectors left the Klondike for the new goldfields, marking the end of the Klondike Rush. The boom towns declined, and the population of Dawson City fell. \n\nGold mining production in the Klondike peaked in 1903, after heavier equipment was brought in. Since then, the Klondike has been mined on and off, and today the legacy draws tourists to the region and contributes to its prosperity.{{refn | group = n |An estimated {{convert|14000000|oz}} of gold has been taken from the area (until 2013) of which half came from Bonanza Creek, and a quarter from Hunker Creek.<ref name=CSWA/>}}\n\n==Background==\n[[FIle:Tlingit-map-modify.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|alt=Map of people and places at the time of discovery of gold in the [[Yukon]].|Yukon at the time of discovery.]]\n\nThe [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|indigenous peoples in north-west America]] had traded in [[copper]] nuggets prior to [[Age of Discovery|European expansion]].

Economically, the news had reached the US at the height of a series of financial recessions and bank failures in the 1890s. The [[gold standard]] of the time tied paper money to the production of gold and shortages towards the end of the 19th century meant that gold dollars were rapidly increasing in value ahead of paper currencies and being hoarded.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=94}} This had contributed to the [[Panic of 1893]] and [[Panic of 1896]], which caused unemployment and financial uncertainty.{{sfn|Morse|2003|p=122}} There was a huge, unresolved demand for gold across the developed world that the Klondike promised to fulfil <!--US: fulfill-->and, for individuals, the region promised higher wages or financial security.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=94}}{{sfn|Morse|2003|p=122}}\n\n[[File:Seattle Post Intelligencer newspaper front page for July 17 1897 announcing the arrival of the steamer PORTLAND in Seattle from the Klondike gold fields.png|thumb|upright|[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer|Seattle newspaper]] announcing the arrival of gold from Klondike, July 17, 1897]]\n\nPsychologically, the Klondike, as historian [[Pierre Berton]] describes, was \"just far enough away to be romantic and just close enough to be accessible.\" Furthermore, the Pacific ports closest to the gold strikes were desperate to encourage trade and travel to the region.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=95}} The mass journalism of the period promoted the event and the human interest stories that lay behind it. A worldwide publicity campaign engineered largely by [[Erastus Brainerd]], a Seattle newspaperman, helped establish that city as the premier supply centre and the departure point for the gold fields.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=102}}{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=96}}\n\nThe prospectors came from many nations, although an estimated majority of 60 to 80 percent were Americans or recent immigrants to America.{{sfn|Fetherling|1997|p=125}}{{sfn|Porsild|1998|p=201}}{{refn |group = n |Traditional historical analysis, as outlined by George Fetherling, has suggested around 80 percent were US citizens or recent immigrants to America.

As Charlene Porsild has described, however, the census data for the period is inconsistent in how it asked questions about citizenship and place of birth. Porsild argues that the level of participation from those born in the US, as opposed to recent immigrants or temporary residents, may have been as low as 43 percent, with Canadian and British born members of the gold rush in the majority.{{sfn|Fetherling|1997|p=125}}{{sfn|Porsild|1998|pp=200\u2013204}}}} Most had no experience in the mining industry, being clerks or salesmen.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=112}} Mass resignations of staff to join the gold rush became notorious.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=101}} In Seattle, this included the mayor, twelve policemen, and a significant percentage of the city's streetcar drivers.{{sfn|Berton|2001|pp=101\u2013102}}\n\nSome stampeders were famous: [[John McGraw (governor)|John McGraw]], the former governor of Washington joined, together with the prominent lawyer and sportsman A.

In theory, no support of the shaft was necessary because of the permafrost although in practice sometimes the fire melted the permafrost and caused collapses.{{sfn|Morse|2003|p=99}} Fires could also produce noxious gases, which had to be removed by bellows or other tools.{{sfn|The Chicago Record|1897|p=17}}{{sfn|Allen|2007|pp=11\u201312}} The resulting \"dirt\" brought out of the mines froze quickly in winter and could be processed only during the warmer summer months.{{sfn|Allen|2007|pp=11\u201312}}{{refn| group = n | In the summer, the sunshine would slowly thaw exposed permafrost at around the rate of {{convert|2|ft}} every 12 hours; some miners felt this too slow, and used burning techniques during the summer months as well.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=169}}}} An alternative, more efficient, approach called steam thawing was devised between 1897 and 1898; this used a furnace to pump steam directly into the ground, but since it required additional equipment it was not a widespread technique during the years of the rush.{{sfn|Adney|1994|p=419}}\n\n[[File:Thawing-eldorado-creek-1898.jpg|thumb|Thawing with steam, 1898]]\nIn the summer, water would be used to sluice and pan the dirt, separating out the heavier gold from gravel.{{sfn|Allen|2007|p=12}} This required miners to construct sluices, which were sequences of wooden boxes {{convert|15|ft}} long, through which the dirt would be washed; up to 20 of these might be needed for each mining operation.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=170}} The sluices in turn required lots of water, usually produced by creating a dam and ditches or crude pipes.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=172}} \"Bench gold\" mining on the hill sides could not use sluice lines because water could not be pumped that high up. Instead, these mines used rockers, boxes that moved back and forth like a cradle, to create the motion needed for separation.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=171}} Finally, the resulting gold dust could be exported out of the Klondike; exchanged for paper money at the rate of $16 ($430) per troy ounce (ozt)<!--gold is measured in troy ounces--> through one of the major banks that opened in Dawson City, or simply used as money when dealing with local traders.{{sfn|Berton|2001|pp=288\u2013289}}{{refn| group = n | Only pure gold dust was bought by banks the rate being $16 ($430) per oz. \"Commercial dust\", still containing black sand, was bought by banks at $11 ($300) per oz.

Many buildings in the center of the town reflect the style of the era.{{sfn|Evans|2010|pp=165, 170}} Klondike River valley is affected by the gold rush by the heavy dredging that occurred after it.{{sfn|Berton|1974|p=415}}\n\nThe port of Skagway also shrank after the rush, but remains a well-preserved period town, centered on the tourist industry and sight-seeing trips from visiting [[cruise ship]]s.{{sfn|Wright|2005|p=70}} Restoration work by the [[National Park Service]] began in 2010 on Jeff Smith's Parlor, from which the famous con man \"Soapy\" Smith once operated.<ref name=\"AutoRZ-15\" /> Skagway also has one of the two visitor centres forming the [[Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park]]; the other is located in Seattle, and both focus on the human interest stories behind the gold rush.{{sfn|Runte|2011|p=132}} By contrast, Dyea, Skagway's neighbour <!--US: neighbor--> and former rival, was abandoned after the gold rush and is now a ghost town.{{sfn|Evans|2010|p=234}} The railway built for prospectors through White Pass in the last year of the rush reopened in 1988 and is today only used by tourists, closely linked to the Chilkoot trail which is a popular [[hiking]] route.{{sfn|Evans|2010|pp=71, 233}}\n\n=== Culture === <!-- Please don't add to this section without discussion in Talk.

The writer Jack London incorporated scenes from the gold rush into his novels and short stories set in the Klondike, including ''[[The Call of the Wild]]'', a novel about a sled<!--US: sled--> dog.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=132}}{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=465}} His colleague, poet [[Robert W. Service]], did not join the rush himself, although he made his home in Dawson City in 1908. Service created well-known poems about the gold rush, among them ''[[Songs of a Sourdough]]'', one of the bestselling books of poetry in the first decade of the 20th century, along with his novel, ''The Trail of '98'', which was written by hand on wallpaper in one of Dawson's log cabins.{{sfn|Winslow|1952|p=132}}{{sfn|Berton|1974|p=71}}{{sfn|Cameron|1997|pp=95\u201396}} The Canadian historian [[Pierre Berton]] grew up in Dawson where his father had been a prospector, and wrote several historical books about the gold rush, such as ''The Last Great Gold Rush''.{{sfn|Berton|2001|pp=424\u2013425}} The experiences of the Irish [[Mic\u00ed Mac Gabhann]] resulted the posthumous work ''Rotha M\u00f3r an tSaoil'' (translated into English as ''The Hard Road to Klondike'' in 1962), a vivid description of the period.{{sfn|Bowden|2008|pp=532\u2013533}}\n\nSome terminology from the stampede made its way into North American English like \"[[wikt:cheechako|Cheechakos]]\", referring to newly arrived miners, and \"[[wikt:sourdough|Sourdoughs]]\", experienced miners.{{sfn|Porsild|1998|pp=15\u201316}}{{refn | group = n | Jack London famously captured the origins of these terms, describing how \"the men who came ashore from the steamers were newcomers. They were known as ''chechaquos'', and they always wilted at the application of the name. They made their bread with baking-powder. This was the invidious distinction between them and the Sour-doughs, who, forsooth, made their bread from sour-dough because they had no baking-powder.\"{{sfn|London|2004b|p=266}} }}\nThe photographs taken during the Klondike gold rush heavily influenced later cultural approaches to the stampede.{{sfn|Porsild|1998|pp=6\u20137}} The gold rush was vividly recorded by several early photographers, for instance [[Eric A. Hegg]]; these stark, black-and-white photographs showing the ascent of the Chilkoot pass rapidly became iconic images and were widely distributed.{{sfn|Porsild|1998|p=3}} These pictures in turn inspired [[Charlie Chaplin]] to make ''[[The Gold Rush]]'', a silent movie, which uses the background of the Klondike to combine physical comedy with its character's desperate battle for survival in the harsh conditions of the stampede.{{sfn|Kamin|2008|pp=126\u2013127}} The photographs reappear in the documentary ''[[City of Gold (1957 film)|City of Gold]]'' from 1957 which, narrated by [[Pierre Berton]], won prizes for pioneering the incorporation of still images into documentary film-making.{{sfn|Tibbetts|1996|pp=123\u2013124}} The Klondike gold rush, however, has not been widely covered in later fictional films; even ''[[The Far Country]]'', a [[Western (genre)|Western]] from 1955 set in the Klondike, largely ignores the unique features of the gold rush in favour<!--US: favors--> of a traditional Western plot.{{sfn|Wright|1975|p=39}} Indeed, much of the popular literature on the gold rush approaches the stampede simply as a final phase of the expansion of the American West, a perception critiqued by modern historians such as Charlene Porsild.{{sfn|Porsild|1998|p=17}}\n\n== Appendix ==\n{{hidden begin|title={{center|Maps, charts, tables and lists}}|style=border:solid 1px #aaa}}\n\n===Maps of routes and goldfields===\n'''Dyea/Skagway routes and Dalton trail'''\n<gallery widths=\"900\" heights=\"440\">\nFile:Dyea-skagway-map.jpg|alt=Map of Dyea/Skagway routes|Overview and close up of Dyea/Skagway route (middle route on left section of map).
