The topics include video games (under the ''James & Mike Mondays'' series), video game peripherals such as [[Future Vision Technologies|the VictorMaxx Stuntmaster headset]], and films. One of Rolfe's other series is ''Board James'', where he and Mike Matei review old board games in a humorous way, often with recurring characters.

Each year, he has adopted a different theme for ''Monster Madness''. 2007 was the history of horror. 2008 was ''Godzillathon'', in which he reviewed all of the Godzilla films chronologically. 2009 was ''Monster Madness Three'', which dealt with a variety of popular and little known films of horror. 2010 was ''Camp Cult'', which dealt with both campy horror films as well as cult classic films, such as ''Troll 2''. 2011 was ''Sequel-A-Thon'', which dealt with horror sequels. And 2012 was ''80's-a-Thon'', which included only movies made in the 1980s. While the first five years of ''Monster Madness'' have been one film review per day for the entirety of the month of October 2012's ''80's-a-Thon'' series of ''Monster Madness'' was reduced to every other day of October due to the production of ''The Angry Video Game Nerd Movie''. Despite the decreased number of film reviews, the film reviews in ''80's-a-Thon'' were longer than previous reviews on ''Monster Madness''.<ref name=\"career\" /> With October 2013's ''Sequel-A-Thon 2'', ''Monster Madness'' has returned to one review per day. 2013 was ''Sequel-A-Thon 2'', which dealt with more horror sequels. The final 31 marathon ''Monster Madness'' series ran during October 2016. Rolfe expressed his desire to move onto other Halloween-themed projects and reviews in the future, but said that ''Monster Madness'' will always live on in some way.<ref>{{cite news | first=Mike | last=Matei | title=Monster Madness X Promo | website=Cinemassacre.com | date=2016-09-22 | url=https://cinemassacre.com/2016/09/22/monster-madness-x-promo/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023035023/https://cinemassacre.com/2016/09/22/monster-madness-x-promo/ | archive-date=October 23, 2016 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, ''Son of Monster Madness'' debuted, which consisted simply of five new reviews, with the rest of October bulked by reuploads of older reviews previously not available on YouTube.  ''Monster Madness'', under the original branding despite not having videos posted everyday, returned in October 2019, now having Rolfe with a guest talk about the films.\n\nOn May 17, 2016, James uploaded a video to Cinemassacre's YouTube channel in which he expressed unhappiness with the [[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|2016 ''Ghostbusters'' reboot film]] and how he planned on not seeing it or releasing a review. Rolfe criticized the film's lack of originality but had no problem with the female cast. This stance was criticized by some in the entertainment industry, with many theorizing that a significant portion of fan backlash against the movie was being grounded in sexism.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sims |first=Davis |date=May 18, 2016 |title=The Ongoing Outcry Against the Ghostbusters Remake |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/05/the-sexist-outcry-against-the-ghostbusters-remake-gets-louder/483270/ |publisher=The Atlantic |access-date=July 25, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725230551/http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/05/the-sexist-outcry-against-the-ghostbusters-remake-gets-louder/483270/ |archive-date=July 25, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nHe attended the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|University of the Arts]] in [[Philadelphia]] from 1999 to 2004.

Indeed, it might be only a small step from saying, \"Ain't we got fun\" in the midst of hardship to the idea that the poor are happier than the rich\u2014because, as the [[Beatles]] intoned, \"Money can't buy me love.\" It is possible that \"Aint We Got Fun,\" a product of the music industry (as opposed to \"[[working-class culture]]\") was part of a complex resolution of crisis in capitalist society. Far from revealing the indomitable spirit of working people, it figured into the means with which they were controlled. It is a problem of interpretation laying at the heart of popular music, one which emerged with particular clarity at the time of the English [[Industrial Revolution]].\n<ref name=\"portis\" />|Larry Portis|Soul Trains}}\n\nHowever, others concentrate on the fun that they got.

Historian [[John Wheeler-Bennett]] says that since the 1740s:\n:Relations between Russia and Germany...have been a series of alienations,  distinguished for their bitterness, and of rapprochements, remarkable for their warmth....A cardinal factor in the relationship has been the existence of an independent Poland...when separated by a buffer state the two great Powers of eastern Europe have  been friendly, whereas a contiguity of frontiers has bred hostility.<ref>John W. Wheeler-Bennett,  \"Twenty Years of Russo-German Relations: 1919-1939\" ''Foreign Affairs'' 25#1  (1946), pp. 23-43. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20030017 online]</ref>\n\nRussia helped liberate Germany in 1812\u201315 in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the two were generally friendly for a century, especially during the time of [[Otto von Bismarck]] who established the [[League of Three Emperors]] in 1873 with Russia, Germany, and Austria-Hungary. But after Bismarck's dismissal in 1890, his successors chose to support Austria against Russia over competing influence in the Balkans. Germany fought against Russia in [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918). Relations were warm in the 1920s, very cold in the 1930s, friendly in 1939\u201341,<ref>Chubarov refers to \"friendly relations\" 1939-41; {{cite book|author=Alexander Chubarov|title=Russia's Bitter Path to Modernity: A History of the Soviet and Post-Soviet Eras|publisher=A&C Black|url=https://archive.org/details/russiasbitterpat0000chub|url-access=registration|year=2001|page=[https://archive.org/details/russiasbitterpat0000chub/page/111 111]}}</ref> and then turned into war to the death in 1941\u201345. In the 1920s both countries co-operated with each other in trade and (secretly) in military affairs.  Hostilities escalated in the 1930s as the Nazis sponsored by Berlin and the Communists sponsored by Moscow fought each other across the world, most famously in the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936\u201339).  In a stunning turnabout in August 1939, [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|both countries came to an agreement]], and divided up the previously independent nations of Eastern Europe. That d\u00e9tente collapsed [[Operation Barbarossa|in 1941 when Germany invaded the USSR]]. The Soviets survived however and formed an alliance with Britain and the U.S., and pushed the Germans back, [[Battle of Berlin|capturing Berlin in May 1945]].\n\nDuring the [[Cold War]] 1947-1991, Germany was divided, with [[East Germany]] under Communist control and under the close watch of Moscow, which stationed a large military force there and [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|repressed an uprising in 1953]].  Since the end of the [[Cold War]] and [[German reunification]], in 1989-91, [[History of Germany|Germany]] and [[History of Russia|Russia]] have developed a \"Strategic Partnership\" in which energy is indisputably one of the most important factors. Germany and Russia depend on each other for energy, namely in Germany's need for energy from Russia and Russia's need for heavy German investment to develop its energy infrastructure.\n\nAccording to a 2014 BBC World Service poll, only 21% of Germans view Russia's influence positively, with 67% expressing a negative view. Russians, however, have a much more positive view of Germany than Germans do of Russia, with 57% viewing Germany's influence positively and 12% negatively.<ref>[http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/country-rating-poll.pdf 2014 World Service Poll] ''[[BBC]]''</ref>\n\nRelations turned highly negative in 2014 in response to Russia's seizure of Crimea from Ukraine and support for insurgents in Ukraine.  Germany was a leader between [[NATO Quint]] in imposing round after round of increasingly harsh European Union sanctions against the Russian oil and banking industries and top allies of [[President of Russia|President]] [[Vladimir Putin]]. Russia responded by cutting food imports from the EU.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe earliest contact between [[Germans]] and [[Slavs]] is unknown.  Substantive contact goes back to the [[Teutonic Order|Teutonic Knights]]' campaigns in the [[Baltic region|Baltic]], where they took control of the land. Prince [[Alexander Nevsky]] defeated the Teutonic Knights at the [[Battle of the Ice]] in 1242\n\nRussia before the mid 18th century was aloof from German affairs, while Germany was divided into numerous small states under the nominal leadership of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\nAfter the [[Great Northern War]] with Sweden, however, Russia's power spread into the Baltic.\n\n[[File:Alexander I, venerates the mortal remains of Frederick the Great in presence of King Frederick William III and Queen Louisa.PNG|166px|thumb|right|Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia]] venerates the mortal remains of [[Frederick the Great]] in presence of King [[Frederick William III]] and [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]] in 1805]]\n\n===German migrations eastward===\nOver the centuries there was a steady [[Ostsiedlung|movement of Germans eastward]], often into mostly Slavic areas and areas near to or controlled by Russia. Flegel, points out that German farmers, traders and entrepreneurs moved into East and West Prussia, the Baltic region (Lithuania, Latvia and Estonian), the Danzig and Vistula River region, Galicia, Slovenia, the Banat, the Bachka, Bukovina, Transylvania, the Volga River district of Russia, Posen, the Duchy of Warsaw, Polish and Ukrainian Volhynia, Bessarabia, and the Mount Ararat region between the 17th and the 20th centuries. Often they came at the invitation of the Russian government. The Germans typically became the dominant factors in land owning and business enterprise. Some groups, such as the Mennonites, migrated to North American 1860-1914.  The Germans in the Baltic states returned home voluntarily in 1940. Some 12 to 14 million were brutally [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u201350)|expelled]] from Poland, Czechoslovakia and other countries in Eastern Europe in 1944-46, with the death of 500,000 or more.<ref>R.

Russia defeated Sweden and Prussia defeated Austria. Russia and Prussia again were at odds during the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u20131763) and fought the battles of  [[Battle of Gross-J\u00e4gersdorf|Gross-J\u00e4gersdorf]], [[Battle of Zorndorf|Zorndorf]], [[Battle of Kay|Kay]] and [[Battle of Kunersdorf|Kunersdorf]].  However, when Russian Tsar [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]] came to power, he made peace with Prussia by signing the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1762)|Treaty of Saint Petersburg]], allowing Prussian King [[Frederick the Great]] to concentrate on his other enemies.\n\nPrussia and Russia in agreement with Austria then cooperated to [[Partitions of Poland|carve up Poland-Lithuania]] between them in 1772, 1793, and 1795. Poland disappeared from the map.\n[[File:1839 Krafft Siegesmeldung nach der Schlacht bei Leipzig 1813 anagoria.JPG|thumb|[[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick III]] of Prussia, [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] of Russia and [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] of Austria after the [[battle of Leipzig]], 1813]]\nBoth Russia and Prussia had [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]] that reacted sharply when the [[French Revolution]] executed the king. They at first were part of the coalition against the new French regime during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and later the [[Napoleonic Wars]].  During the Napoleonic era (1799 to 1815) Austria, Prussia, and Russia were at one time or another in coalition with Napoleon against his arch-enemy Great Britain. In the end, the two German states of Austria and Prussia united with Russia and Britain in opposing Napoleon. That coalition was primarily a matter of convenience for each nation.  The key matchmaker was the Austrian Chancellor Klemens von Metternich,  who forged a united front that proved decisive in overthrowing Napoleon, 1813-1814.<ref>Philip G.

The revolutions of 1848 did not reach Russia, but its political and economic system was inadequate to maintain a modern army.  It did poorly in the [[Crimean War]].

Prussia was shaken by the [[Revolutions of 1848]] but was able to withstand the revolutionaries' call to war against Russia.  Prussia did go to war with Denmark, however, and was only stopped by British and Russian pressure. Prussia remained neutral in the Crimean War.\n\nPrussia's successes in the [[Unification of Germany|Wars of German Unification]] in the 1860s were facilitated by Russia's lack of involvement.  The creation of the [[German Empire]] under Prussian dominance in 1871, however, greatly changed the relations between the two countries.\n\n===The German and Russian Empires===\n[[Image:Triple Alliance.png|thumb|The Triple Alliance (shown in red) was constructed by Germany to isolate France; it responded by a new alliance, the [[Triple Entente]] with Britain and Russia.

German Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] formed the  [[League of the Three Emperors]] in 1872 binding together Russia, Austria, and Germany. The League stated that [[republicanism]] and [[socialism]] were common enemies, and that the three powers would discuss any matters concerning foreign policy.

This upset the British in particular, as they were long concerned with preserving the [[Ottoman Empire]] and preventing a Russian takeover of the [[Bosphorus]]. Germany hosted the [[Congress of Berlin]] (1878), whereby a more moderate peace settlement was agreed to. Germany had no direct interest in the Balkans, however, which was largely an Austrian and Russian sphere of influence.<ref>E.

The establishment of the Dual Alliance led Russia to take a more conciliatory stance, and in 1887, the so-called [[Reinsurance Treaty]] was signed between Germany and Russia: in it, the two powers agreed on mutual military support in the case that France attacked Germany, or in case of an Austrian attack on Russia.  Russia turned its attention eastward to Asia and remained largely inactive in European politics for the next 25 years.<ref>{{Citation | first=Patricia A. | last=Weitsman | title=Dangerous alliances: proponents of peace, weapons of war | year=2004 | page=79}}</ref>\n\nGermany was somewhat worried about Russia's potential industrialization\u2014it had far more potential soldiers\u2014while Russia feared Germany's already established industrial power.

German chancellor [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]] placed high value on relations with Russia and worked for the completion of the [[Nord Stream]] gas pipeline between them.  His successor [[Angela Merkel]], an Easterner and former dissident, has been more critical and clashed with Russian [[President of Russia|president]] [[Vladimir Putin]] over [[Human rights in Russia|human rights]] and other issues. However, she, like her predecessor, always put a high value on the Nordstream pipeline, due to its ability to increase Russian influence, and most importantly her lobbying fee, for which she would find a way to be compensated for. Most of the human rights issues, could be seen as side-shows for the public - whilst the end-goal was always the completion of, and compensation for NordStream. The project under both the Bush and Obama administration moved forward at rapid pace, but with only 300km left, the Trump Administration halted the project by putting pressure on the Danish company overseeing the completion of the pipeline.<ref>https://www.worldoil.com/news/2019/12/24/trump-s-sanctions-lead-allseas-to-halt-nord-stream-2-work </ref> Germany\u2019s relations with Russia were never likely to be as cozy under Angela Merkel as under her predecessor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, who adopted a 3-year-old Russian girl and, on his 60th birthday, invited President Vladimir V.

Relations turned highly negative in 2014 in response to Russia's seizure of Crimea from Ukraine and support for insurgents in Ukraine.  Germany was a leader  between  [[NATO Quint]]  in imposing round after round of increasingly harsh sanctions against the Russian oil and banking industries and top allies of President Putin.

The ''Los Angeles Times'' reported that:\n:Merkel and her fellow Western leaders are angered by Russia's actions in Ukraine, especially its seizure of Crimea, support for pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine and fresh military incursion. Moscow's denial that it has any involvement in Ukraine's blood conflict only irks them more. The German chancellor has signaled a tougher stance toward Russia, spelling out her willingness to sacrifice German economic interests and further boost sanctions to send a strong message that Moscow's actions are unacceptable.

The annual trade turnover between the two countries had exceeded the $80 billion-level just before the sanctions were imposed. It is estimated that mutual sanctions entailed the decline in the bilateral trade volume of up to 20% that meant billions of losses for the German economy and, obviously, many jobs being cut.

Historian [[John Wheeler-Bennett]] says that since the 1740s:\n:Relations between Russia and Germany...have been a series of alienations,  distinguished for their bitterness, and of rapprochements, remarkable for their warmth....A cardinal factor in the relationship has been the existence of an independent Poland...when separated by a buffer state the two great Powers of eastern Europe have  been friendly, whereas a contiguity of frontiers has bred hostility.<ref>John W. Wheeler-Bennett,  \"Twenty Years of Russo-German Relations: 1919-1939\" ''Foreign Affairs'' 25#1  (1946), pp. 23-43. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20030017 online]</ref>\n\nRussia helped liberate Germany in 1812\u201315 in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the two were generally friendly for a century, especially during the time of [[Otto von Bismarck]] who established the [[League of Three Emperors]] in 1873 with Russia, Germany, and Austria-Hungary. But after Bismarck's dismissal in 1890, his successors chose to support Austria against Russia over competing influence in the Balkans. Germany fought against Russia in [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918). Relations were warm in the 1920s, very cold in the 1930s, friendly in 1939\u201341,<ref>Chubarov refers to \"friendly relations\" 1939-41; {{cite book|author=Alexander Chubarov|title=Russia's Bitter Path to Modernity: A History of the Soviet and Post-Soviet Eras|publisher=A&C Black|url=https://archive.org/details/russiasbitterpat0000chub|url-access=registration|year=2001|page=[https://archive.org/details/russiasbitterpat0000chub/page/111 111]}}</ref> and then turned into war to the death in 1941\u201345. In the 1920s both countries co-operated with each other in trade and (secretly) in military affairs.  Hostilities escalated in the 1930s as the Nazis sponsored by Berlin and the Communists sponsored by Moscow fought each other across the world, most famously in the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936\u201339).  In a stunning turnabout in August 1939, [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|both countries came to an agreement]], and divided up the previously independent nations of Eastern Europe. That d\u00e9tente collapsed [[Operation Barbarossa|in 1941 when Germany invaded the USSR]]. The Soviets survived however and formed an alliance with Britain and the U.S., and pushed the Germans back, [[Battle of Berlin|capturing Berlin in May 1945]].\n\nDuring the [[Cold War]] 1947-1991, Germany was divided, with [[East Germany]] under Communist control and under the close watch of Moscow, which stationed a large military force there and [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|repressed an uprising in 1953]].  Since the end of the [[Cold War]] and [[German reunification]], in 1989-91, [[History of Germany|Germany]] and [[History of Russia|Russia]] have developed a \"Strategic Partnership\" in which energy is indisputably one of the most important factors. Germany and Russia depend on each other for energy, namely in Germany's need for energy from Russia and Russia's need for heavy German investment to develop its energy infrastructure.\n\nAccording to a 2014 BBC World Service poll, only 21% of Germans view Russia's influence positively, with 67% expressing a negative view. Russians, however, have a much more positive view of Germany than Germans do of Russia, with 57% viewing Germany's influence positively and 12% negatively.<ref>[http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/country-rating-poll.pdf 2014 World Service Poll] ''[[BBC]]''</ref>\n\nRelations turned highly negative in 2014 in response to Russia's seizure of Crimea from Ukraine and support for insurgents in Ukraine.  Germany was a leader between [[NATO Quint]] in imposing round after round of increasingly harsh European Union sanctions against the Russian oil and banking industries and top allies of [[President of Russia|President]] [[Vladimir Putin]]. Russia responded by cutting food imports from the EU.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe earliest contact between [[Germans]] and [[Slavs]] is unknown.  Substantive contact goes back to the [[Teutonic Order|Teutonic Knights]]' campaigns in the [[Baltic region|Baltic]], where they took control of the land. Prince [[Alexander Nevsky]] defeated the Teutonic Knights at the [[Battle of the Ice]] in 1242\n\nRussia before the mid 18th century was aloof from German affairs, while Germany was divided into numerous small states under the nominal leadership of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\nAfter the [[Great Northern War]] with Sweden, however, Russia's power spread into the Baltic.\n\n[[File:Alexander I, venerates the mortal remains of Frederick the Great in presence of King Frederick William III and Queen Louisa.PNG|166px|thumb|right|Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia]] venerates the mortal remains of [[Frederick the Great]] in presence of King [[Frederick William III]] and [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]] in 1805]]\n\n===German migrations eastward===\nOver the centuries there was a steady [[Ostsiedlung|movement of Germans eastward]], often into mostly Slavic areas and areas near to or controlled by Russia. Flegel, points out that German farmers, traders and entrepreneurs moved into East and West Prussia, the Baltic region (Lithuania, Latvia and Estonian), the Danzig and Vistula River region, Galicia, Slovenia, the Banat, the Bachka, Bukovina, Transylvania, the Volga River district of Russia, Posen, the Duchy of Warsaw, Polish and Ukrainian Volhynia, Bessarabia, and the Mount Ararat region between the 17th and the 20th centuries. Often they came at the invitation of the Russian government. The Germans typically became the dominant factors in land owning and business enterprise. Some groups, such as the Mennonites, migrated to North American 1860-1914.  The Germans in the Baltic states returned home voluntarily in 1940. Some 12 to 14 million were brutally [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u201350)|expelled]] from Poland, Czechoslovakia and other countries in Eastern Europe in 1944-46, with the death of 500,000 or more.<ref>R.

Russia defeated Sweden and Prussia defeated Austria. Russia and Prussia again were at odds during the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u20131763) and fought the battles of  [[Battle of Gross-J\u00e4gersdorf|Gross-J\u00e4gersdorf]], [[Battle of Zorndorf|Zorndorf]], [[Battle of Kay|Kay]] and [[Battle of Kunersdorf|Kunersdorf]].  However, when Russian Tsar [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]] came to power, he made peace with Prussia by signing the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1762)|Treaty of Saint Petersburg]], allowing Prussian King [[Frederick the Great]] to concentrate on his other enemies.\n\nPrussia and Russia in agreement with Austria then cooperated to [[Partitions of Poland|carve up Poland-Lithuania]] between them in 1772, 1793, and 1795. Poland disappeared from the map.\n[[File:1839 Krafft Siegesmeldung nach der Schlacht bei Leipzig 1813 anagoria.JPG|thumb|[[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick III]] of Prussia, [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] of Russia and [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] of Austria after the [[battle of Leipzig]], 1813]]\nBoth Russia and Prussia had [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]] that reacted sharply when the [[French Revolution]] executed the king. They at first were part of the coalition against the new French regime during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and later the [[Napoleonic Wars]].  During the Napoleonic era (1799 to 1815) Austria, Prussia, and Russia were at one time or another in coalition with Napoleon against his arch-enemy Great Britain. In the end, the two German states of Austria and Prussia united with Russia and Britain in opposing Napoleon. That coalition was primarily a matter of convenience for each nation.  The key matchmaker was the Austrian Chancellor Klemens von Metternich,  who forged a united front that proved decisive in overthrowing Napoleon, 1813-1814.<ref>Philip G.

The revolutions of 1848 did not reach Russia, but its political and economic system was inadequate to maintain a modern army.  It did poorly in the [[Crimean War]].  As Fuller notes, \"Russia had been beaten on the Crimean peninsula, and the military feared that it would inevitably be beaten again unless steps were taken to surmount its military weakness.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=William C.

Prussia was shaken by the [[Revolutions of 1848]] but was able to withstand the revolutionaries' call to war against Russia.  Prussia did go to war with Denmark, however, and was only stopped by British and Russian pressure. Prussia remained neutral in the Crimean War.\n\nPrussia's successes in the [[Unification of Germany|Wars of German Unification]] in the 1860s were facilitated by Russia's lack of involvement.  The creation of the [[German Empire]] under Prussian dominance in 1871, however, greatly changed the relations between the two countries.\n\n===The German and Russian Empires===\n[[Image:Triple Alliance.png|thumb|The Triple Alliance (shown in red) was constructed by Germany to isolate France; it responded by a new alliance, the [[Triple Entente]] with Britain and Russia.

German Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] formed the  [[League of the Three Emperors]] in 1872 binding together Russia, Austria, and Germany. The League stated that [[republicanism]] and [[socialism]] were common enemies, and that the three powers would discuss any matters concerning foreign policy.

This upset the British in particular, as they were long concerned with preserving the [[Ottoman Empire]] and preventing a Russian takeover of the [[Bosphorus]]. Germany hosted the [[Congress of Berlin]] (1878), whereby a more moderate peace settlement was agreed to. Germany had no direct interest in the Balkans, however, which was largely an Austrian and Russian sphere of influence.<ref>E.

The establishment of the Dual Alliance led Russia to take a more conciliatory stance, and in 1887, the so-called [[Reinsurance Treaty]] was signed between Germany and Russia: in it, the two powers agreed on mutual military support in the case that France attacked Germany, or in case of an Austrian attack on Russia.  Russia turned its attention eastward to Asia and remained largely inactive in European politics for the next 25 years.<ref>{{Citation | first=Patricia A. | last=Weitsman | title=Dangerous alliances: proponents of peace, weapons of war | year=2004 | page=79}}</ref>\n\nGermany was somewhat worried about Russia's potential industrialization\u2014it had far more potential soldiers\u2014while Russia feared Germany's already established industrial power.  In 1907 Russia went into a coalition with Britain and France, the [[Triple Entente]].<ref>Bernadotte Schmitt, ''Triple Alliance and Triple Entente'' (1971)</ref>\n\nThe ultimate result of this was that Russia and Germany became enemies in [[World War I]]. The [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] saw Germany successful, with victories at [[Battle of Tannenberg|Tannenberg]], [[First Battle of the Masurian Lakes|First]] and [[Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes|Second Masurian Lakes]] and [[Lake Naroch Offensive|Lake Naroch]]. The czarist system collapsed in 1917. The Bolsheviks came to power in the [[October Revolution]].

However, she, like her predecessor, always put a high value on the Nordstream pipeline, due to it's ability to increase Russian influence, and most importantly her lobbying fee, for which she would find a way to be compensated for. Most of the human rights issues, could be seen as side-shows for the public - whilst the end-goal was always the completion of, and compensation for NordStream. The project under both the Bush and Obama administration moved forward at rapid pace, but with only 300km left, the Trump Administration halted the project by putting pressure on the Danish company overseeing the completion of the pipeline.<ref>https://www.worldoil.com/news/2019/12/24/trump-s-sanctions-lead-allseas-to-halt-nord-stream-2-work </ref> Germany\u2019s relations with Russia were never likely to be as cozy under Angela Merkel as under her predecessor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, who adopted a 3-year-old Russian girl and, on his 60th birthday, invited President Vladimir V. Putin home to celebrate.\n\n===21st century===\n\n{{main|Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation}}\nRelations were normal in the first part of the new century, with expanding trade relations and an increasing German reliance on pipeline shipments of Russian natural gas. Relations turned highly negative in 2014 in response to Russia's seizure of Crimea from Ukraine and support for insurgents in Ukraine.  Germany was a leader  between  [[NATO Quint]]  in imposing round after round of increasingly harsh sanctions against the Russian oil and banking industries and top allies of President Putin. Russia responded by cutting food imports from the EU.\n\nSince the crisis began, Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] told President Putin that the [[2014 Crimean status referendum|referendum on accession of Crimea to Russia]] is illegal.<ref>[https://news.yahoo.com/cold-war-kids-merkel-and-putin-square-off-over-crimean-crisis-205925438.html Cold War kids Merkel and Putin square off over Crimean crisis]</ref>\n\n===2014 sanctions===\n{{main|International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis}}\nThe European Union, the United States and their allies began using economic sanctions to force Russia to reverse course regarding the Ukraine and stop supporting [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine]].  The ''Los Angeles Times'' reported that:\n:Merkel and her fellow Western leaders are angered by Russia's actions in Ukraine, especially its seizure of Crimea, support for pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine and fresh military incursion. Moscow's denial that it has any involvement in Ukraine's blood conflict only irks them more. The German chancellor has signaled a tougher stance toward Russia, spelling out her willingness to sacrifice German economic interests and further boost sanctions to send a strong message that Moscow's actions are unacceptable. [She said,] \"Being able to change borders in Europe without consequences, and attacking other countries with troops, is in my view a far greater danger than having to accept certain disadvantages for the economy.\"<ref>Robyn Dixon, \"As NATO talks near, Merkel appears to be losing patience with Putin,\" [http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-germany-merkel-putin-20140904-story.html#page=1 ''Los Angeles Times,'' Sept 3, 2014]</ref>\n\nOn the left, however, former Social Democrat Chancellor [[Gerhard Schroeder]] announced his understanding of Russian policies and support for Putin. The ''New York Times'' editorialized that Schr\u00f6der's decision to \"embrace him [Putin] in a bear hug sent an unacceptable signal that some prominent Europeans are willing to ignore Mr. Putin's brutish ways.\"<ref>Ralf Neukirch, \"The Wrong Impression: Schr\u00f6der's Russia Ties Are Bad Politics,\" [http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/embrace-of-putin-by-schroeder-bad-for-german-foreign-policy-a-967900.html ''Spiegel Online International May 6, 2014], with a photo of the \"bear hug.\"</ref>  According to the Russian news agency [[Russian News Agency TASS|ITAR/TASS]], Russia's Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev admits the sanctions are hurting the Russian economy and slowing its growth. However he expects support oil industries that are hurt, to seek financing and high technology from Asia, and to import food from new sources.<ref>ITAR-TASS, \"Sanctions likely to pose risks for Russia to fall behind in technology \u2014 Medvedev,\" [http://en.itar-tass.com/russia/750401 September 19, 2014, online] and \"Russian economy grows badly, GDP rise not to exceed 0.5% in 2014 \u2014 Medvedev\" [http://en.itar-tass.com/economy/750358 September 19, 2014]</ref>\n\nGermany has traditionally been one of Russia's key economic partners. The annual trade turnover between the two countries had exceeded the $80 billion-level just before the sanctions were imposed. It is estimated that mutual sanctions entailed the decline in the bilateral trade volume of up to 20% that meant billions of losses for the German economy and, obviously, many jobs being cut. By early 2014, when the conflict was about to start, not only did German exports to Russia constitute the third of the whole EU's, but more than 6,200 German firms operated in Russia itself.<ref>Murad Muradov, \"Ukraine: Germany`s Russian lobby\"[http://thepoliticon.net/analytics/234-germanys-russian-lobby.html ''The Politicon,'' 26 November 2015]</ref> In 2017, for the first time since the introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in 2014, bilateral trade increased - by 22.8%, amounting to about $ 50 billion. In the first eight months of 2018, the volume of mutual trade between Russia and Germany increased by almost a quarter compared to the same period last year. At the same time, Russian exports to Germany in 2018 increased by 35% to $22.1 billion, while imports rose by 12% to $16.9 billion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ru-eu.org:443/news/48053/|title=\u041f\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043d \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0447\u0435 \u0441 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043e\u043c \u043e\u0431\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e-\u044d\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0420\u0424 \u0438 \u0424\u0420\u0413|website=www.ru-eu.org|language=ru|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref>\n\nRussians believe their main enemies in the world\u00a0are the U.S., Ukraine, Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, with 62 percent of Russians polled have\u00a0a poor opinion of\u00a0the EU, while Germany is rated poorly, according to a Levada Center\u00a0poll that measures sentiments towards other countries.

Russia regards Germany as its foremost European partner; conversely, Russia is an important trading partner for Germany.\n*Germany and Russia are cooperating in building the [[Nord Stream]] gas pipeline.\n*Many former East Germans have a good command of the [[Russian language]] and considerable knowledge about Russia. The [[German language]] is in a firm second place (behind English) at Russian schools.

This accord aims at stepping up bilateral cooperation in the education sector, particularly in training specialist and executive personnel.\n*Germany has a heavy industry with the size and capacity to modernize infrastructure in Russia.

Created by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], it first appeared in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] [[video game]] ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', where it dropped enemies called Spinies on the stage. It has a striped green shell, wears aviator goggles, and rides around in a smiling [[cloud]]. He has since appeared in several main ''Mario'' titles since, as well as ''Mario'' spin-off titles, notably the ''[[Mario Kart]]'' series where he acts as the referee and a playable character in ''[[Mario Kart 7]]'', ''[[Mario Kart 8]]'' and ''[[Mario Kart Tour]]''. He has appeared in non-''Mario'' titles, including the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series as an assist trophy in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'', ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]''.\n\nSince appearing in ''Super Mario Bros.'', Lakitu has received somewhat positive reception. It has appeared in the form of several kinds of merchandise, including on [[t-shirt]]s, [[sticker]]s, and a [[dry erase board]]. While he has been regarded as one of the best ''Mario'' villains by [[GameDaily]], he has been decried by several editors for being a troublesome enemy, including [[1UP.com]] editor Jeremy Parish and [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4TV]] editor Andrew Pfister.\n\n==Concept and description==\nLakitu is a [[Koopa Troopa|Koopa]] who rides in a cloud and drops creatures called Spinies on the ground. It has a green [[turtle shell]] and yellow skin like most Koopas, but is differentiated by a thick pair of glasses (or goggles) and a different shell design. Its [[cloud]] \"vehicle\" has a smiling face on it. Lakitus come in several varieties as well. Some Lakitus can be seen coming out of pipes, while others use a [[fishing pole]] for a variety of things, such as holding a [[1-Up Mushroom]] or a [[traffic light]] (in ''[[Mario Kart]]'' games). An early variation of the Lakitu features Lakitu riding a plane. Lakitus frequently also utilize the ability to produce electricity. A variation of the Lakitu is the Fishin' Boo, a ghost that rides a cloud. ''Mario'' series creator [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] commented that Lakitu was the game character who represented him best. He described Lakitu as \"very free, floating in the air, going anywhere.

A playable Paper Lakitu appears in the first ''[[Paper Mario]]'' game called Lakilester. While he acts antagonistically towards Paper Mario, it eventually joins him after his girlfriend, Lakilulu, convinces him. The playable Lakitu in ''Mario Kart 7'', ''Mario Kart 8'', and ''Mario Kart Tour'' has a red shell, though the differences between red and green shelled Lakitus are unknown. Lakitu has also made appearances in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series starting with the [[Super Smash Bros.

Created by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], it first appeared in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] [[video game]] ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', where it dropped enemies called Spinies on the stage. It has a striped green shell, wears aviator goggles, and rides around in a smiling [[cloud]]. He has since appeared in several main ''Mario'' titles since, as well as ''Mario'' spin-off titles, notably the ''[[Mario Kart]]'' series where he acts as the referee and a playable character in ''[[Mario Kart 7]]'', ''[[Mario Kart 8]]'' and ''[[Mario Kart Tour]]''. He has appeared in non-''Mario'' titles, including the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series as an assist trophy in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'', ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]''.\n\nSince appearing in ''Super Mario Bros.'', Lakitu has received somewhat positive reception. It has appeared in the form of several kinds of merchandise, including on [[t-shirt]]s, [[sticker]]s, and a [[dry erase board]]. While he has been regarded as one of the best ''Mario'' villains by [[GameDaily]], he has been decried by several editors for being a troublesome enemy, including [[1UP.com]] editor Jeremy Parish and [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4TV]] editor Andrew Pfister.\n\n==Concept and description==\nLakitu is a [[Koopa Troopa|Koopa]] who rides in a cloud and drops creatures called Spinies on the ground. It has a green [[turtle shell]] and yellow skin like most Koopas, but is differentiated by a thick pair of glasses (or goggles) and a different shell design. Its [[cloud]] \"vehicle\" has a smiling face on it. Lakitus come in several varieties as well. Some Lakitus can be seen coming out of pipes, while others use a [[fishing pole]] for a variety of things, such as holding a [[1-Up Mushroom]] or a [[traffic light]] (in ''[[Mario Kart]]'' games). An early variation of the Lakitu features Lakitu riding a plane. Lakitus frequently also utilize the ability to produce electricity. A variation of the Lakitu is the Fishin' Boo, a ghost that rides a cloud. ''Mario'' series creator [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] commented that Lakitu was the game character who represented him best. He described Lakitu as \"very free, floating in the air, going anywhere. And that's me, that is.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.n-sider.com/contentview.php?contentid=223 |title=Profile: Shigeru Miyamoto |publisher=N-Sider.com |date=1952-11-16 |accessdate=2010-09-08}}</ref> The Spinies that it drops are typically red turtles with spikes on their backs that hatch from \"Spiny Eggs.\"\n\n==Appearances==\n[[File:Lakitu in Super Mario Bros.

In ''[[Super Mario World]]'' for the [[Super NES]], its cloud can be stolen by the player-character and used as a flying vehicle for a period of time.
