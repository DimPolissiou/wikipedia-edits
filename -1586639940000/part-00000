The purpose of the fortress was to provide a secure naval base for the Russian [[Baltic fleet]] and to protect Helsinki and block routes to [[Saint Petersburg]] from a possible [[Germany|German]] invasion. Krepost Sveaborg was part of [[Peter the Great's Naval Fortress]], a coastal fortification system protecting access to Saint Petersburg by sea. The central part of Krepost Sveaborg was the old fortress of [[Suomenlinna]] where the fortress headquarters were located. Due to technological advances in artillery the old fortress was no longer capable of providing a sufficient protection, and a new main defensive line was built well beyond the old fortress boundaries. New [[coastal artillery]] guns built on outlying islands protected Krepost Sveaborg from the sea, while fortified lines constructed around Helsinki were intended to stop any attacks on land. The primary coastal guns were [[254mm 45 caliber Pattern 1891|{{convert|10|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} model 1891 guns]] and [[152 mm 45 caliber Pattern 1892|{{convert|6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} model 1892]] [[Canet gun]]s. Older [[11-inch gun M1877|{{convert|11|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} model 1877 guns]] were also used. In summer 1917 the fortress had two hundred coastal or anti-landing guns, of which 24 were 10-inch guns in six batteries, 16 were 6-inch Canet guns in four batteries and twelve were 11-inch guns in three batteries.<ref name=\"Manninen\">{{Cite book | last = Manninen | first = Markus | title = Viapori - Merilinnoitus ensimm\u00e4isess\u00e4 maailmansodassa 1914\u20141918 [Viapori - Sea fortress during the First World War 1914-1918] | publisher = Sotamuseo | year = 2000 | isbn = 951-25-1137-1}}</ref>{{rp|31}} The artillery used in land fortifications included older coastal guns, old fixed carriage guns and newer light field guns.

Some further construction work was carried out during the remaining year, but all work halted during the [[October Revolution]]. Following the [[Finnish Declaration of Independence]], parts of the land fortifications were used in the [[Finnish Civil War]]. The coastal fortifications were later taken over by Finland to protect Helsinki, while the land fortifications were mostly abandoned and disarmed.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://weegee.espoo.fi/museot/verkko/valli/vamik.htm | title = Miksi linnoitteet rakennettiin? | work = Kuka kaivoi vallihaudat | publisher = Espoon kaupunginmuseo | language = Finnish | trans-title = Why the fortifications were built | accessdate = 2010-05-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100717235328/http://weegee.espoo.fi/museot/verkko/valli/vamik.htm | archive-date = 2010-07-17 | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref name=\"rky\">{{cite web | url = http://www.rky.fi/read/asp/r_kohde_det.aspx?KOHDE_ID=1570 | title = P\u00e4\u00e4kaupunkiseudun I maailmansodan linnoitteet | date = 2009-12-22 | work = Valtakunnallisesti merkitt\u00e4v\u00e4t rakennetut kulttuuriymp\u00e4rist\u00f6t\n| publisher   = [[Finnish National Board of Antiquities|Museovirasto]]| language = Finnish |trans-title=First World War fortifications in the capital area | accessdate = 2010-05-23}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\n[[Sweden]] had ceded [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] to [[Russian Empire]] as the result of the [[Finnish War]] of 1808\u20141809 and along with it the fortress of [[Sveaborg]], {{lang-fi|'''Viapori'''}}, the present day Suomenlinna. The fortress protected the southern Finland and became a naval base for the Russian Baltic Fleet. After the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] many new buildings were built to improve the living conditions on the fortress, but the fortifications were neglected. After the start of the [[Crimean War]] in 1853 construction of new fortifications began on the other nearby islands and on the southern shore of Helsinki peninsula. In 1854 an Anglo-French naval fleet entered the [[Baltic Sea]], hastening the work. These fortifications protected the flanks of the fortress and provided depth to the defence, but the problem of obsolescent artillery was not solved. Thus when the fleet attacked the fortress on the 6th of August 1855 they were able to bombard the fortress for two days from a distance of {{convert|4|-|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} while the best Russian guns had a maximum range of {{convert|2500|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|9\u201311}}<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.suomenlinna.fi/linnoitus/linnoitusjarjestelma/krimin_sota | title = Linnoitus vuosina 1808 - 1856 | work = Suomenlinnan merilinnoituksen viralliset sivut | publisher = Suomenlinnan hoitokunta | language = Finnish | trans-title = Fortress between 1808 - 1856 | accessdate = 2010-05-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100504091302/http://www.suomenlinna.fi/linnoitus/linnoitusjarjestelma/krimin_sota | archive-date = 2010-05-04 | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Suomenlinna_vallanvaihdosta_krimin_sotaan\">{{cite web | url = http://www.suomenlinna.fi/linnoitus/historia/venajan_vallan_aika/vallanvaihdosta_krimin_sotaan | title = Vallanvaihdosta Krimin sotaan | work = Suomenlinnan merilinnoituksen viralliset sivut | publisher = Suomenlinnan hoitokunta | language = Finnish | trans-title = From change of authority to Crimean War | accessdate = 2010-05-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100504090347/http://www.suomenlinna.fi/linnoitus/historia/venajan_vallan_aika/vallanvaihdosta_krimin_sotaan | archive-date = 2010-05-04 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nAfter Crimean War fortifications of Viapori were improved by building artillery [[casemate]]s and new bomb-proof buildings. Vallisaari just east of Suomenlinna was the site of the first new construction works. The harsh suppression of the [[Poland|Polish]] [[January Uprising]] of 1863 and the resulting criticism soured the relationships between Russia and western Europe and hastened the fortification works. Between 1863 and 1864 [[redoubt]]s were built on Vallisaari, Kuninkaansaari and Santahamina islands. In 1860s and 1870s Russia purchased and then built under license new [[Prussia]]n [[Krupp]] rifled breech loading guns which were also used in Viapori. A total of 32 new bomb-proof stone powder cellars were built by the beginning of the 1870s, further improving the defences. The [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878]] was the next crisis that threatened the peace between Russia and England, with new batteries being built at Viapori on Kuninkaansaari and older ones improved or rebuilt. New technology in the form of [[Electrical telegraph|telegraph]], [[railway]] lines and [[searchlight]]s began to be used. Improvements in artillery and ammunition forced improving the gun positions by covering the old walls and fortifications with a thick earthen walls. With high-explosive shells appearing at the end of the 19th century earth and stone were no longer sufficient and first concrete fortifications with steel doors were built in Viapori. Continually improving guns resulted increased range, necessitating [[Coincidence rangefinder|rangefinder]]s, while heavier guns and ammunition required improving piers, roads, cranes and ammunition carts to transport the guns or move ammunition from magazines to guns. Despite the improvements the funds and resources allocated to the fortress were not sufficient to keep pace with the evolution of military technology. While parts of the fortress or were improved and new weapons or equipment were received, the overall condition of the fortress became ever more obsolescent, and the vulnerability of the flanks and rear were a lasting problem. By the end of 1880s and early 1890s Viapori could no longer be considered a proper fortress but only a coastal position, capable of defending only against an enemy coming directly from the sea. The primary role of the fortress became more one of internal politics, as it helped the Russians maintain control of Helsinki.<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|12\u201315}}<ref name=\"Suomenlinna_vallanvaihdosta_krimin_sotaan\"/><ref name=\"Suomenlinna_sodan_jalkeiset_uudistukset\">{{cite web | url = http://www.suomenlinna.fi/linnoitus/linnoitusjarjestelma/sodan_jalkeiset_uudistukset | title = Sodan j\u00e4lkeiset uudistukset | work = Suomenlinnan merilinnoituksen viralliset sivut | publisher = Suomenlinnan hoitokunta | language = Finnish | trans-title = Improvements after the war | accessdate = 2010-05-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100504091007/http://www.suomenlinna.fi/linnoitus/linnoitusjarjestelma/sodan_jalkeiset_uudistukset | archive-date = 2010-05-04 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n==Krepost Sveaborg==\n\nIn the 1890s the priority of the fortification works in the Baltic Sea had been the protection of the ice-free port of [[Liep\u0101ja]], and the [[Kronstadt]] fortress protecting Saint Petersburg, relegating Viapori to a secondary status. After the losses during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] and in light of the rising might of the [[Imperial German Navy]], Liep\u0101ja was considered too vulnerable for a main fleet base, and the decision to build Peter the Great's Naval Fortress was made. In the new plans the main line of defence against the enemy was at the [[Porkkala]]-[[Tallinn]] line with Tallinn also the new main base for the Russian Baltic Fleet. Helsinki was to be a base for torpedo boat flotillas. The construction of the Tallinn naval base was delayed however, and with the new ships being constructed to replace the losses suffered against Japan the Russian Navy was forced to rely more on Helsinki despite the obsolete armament and inadequate fortifications at Viapori. As the threat of war in Europe grew, it became essential to expand the fortress to provide a necessary protection for the naval base. Until 1910, when the first 152&nbsp;mm Canet guns arrived, the only modern weapons at Viapori were [[QF 6 pounder Nordenfelt|57 mm quick fire guns]] with the rest of the artillery designs dating from the Russo-Turkish War. The first new 254&nbsp;mm guns arrived in 1913, but it was not until early 1914 that construction of the first new batteries began on [[Melkki]] and [[Isosaari]]. During the First World War the new '''Krepost Sveaborg''' was built to substantially expand the old fortress. A new ''main line of defence'' was constructed on the outlying islands, pushing the defensive line several kilometers southward, thus providing a secure outer anchorage south of the old fortress for larger warships without the need to navigate the narrow straits leading to the inner anchorage at Kruunuvuorenselk\u00e4. The older parts of the fortress became a ''second line of defence'' and the main storage areas. The rear of the fortress was finally protected by land fortifications, at first field fortifications on the Helsinki peninsula built in 1914, and, later, an outer line of fixed fortifications.<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|15\u201317}}<ref name=\"rky\"/><ref name=\"Suomenlinna_linnoitus_i_maailmansodassa\">{{cite web | url = http://www.suomenlinna.fi/linnoitus/linnoitusjarjestelma/linnoitus_i_maailmansodassa | title = Linnoitus I maailmansodassa | work = Suomenlinnan merilinnoituksen viralliset sivut | publisher = Suomenlinnan hoitokunta | language = Finnish | trans-title = The fortress during the First World War | accessdate = 2010-05-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100504090710/http://www.suomenlinna.fi/linnoitus/linnoitusjarjestelma/linnoitus_i_maailmansodassa | archive-date = 2010-05-04 | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Suomenlinna_i_maailmansota\">{{cite web | url = http://www.suomenlinna.fi/linnoitus/historia/venajan_vallan_aika/i_maailmansota | title = I maailmansota | work = Suomenlinnan merilinnoituksen viralliset sivut | publisher = Suomenlinnan hoitokunta | language = Finnish | trans-title = First World War | accessdate = 2010-05-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110529163054/http://www.suomenlinna.fi/linnoitus/historia/venajan_vallan_aika/i_maailmansota | archive-date = 2011-05-29 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n==Troops and organization==\n\nAt the start of the First World War Krepost Sveaborg was subordinated to the Russian [[6th Army (Russian Empire)|6th Army]]. In summer 1916 Krepost Sveaborg was subordinated to Baltic Fleet. At the start of the war Krepost Sveaborg was divided into three defensive areas, with the sea front forming one defensive area and the land front divided to [[Pasila]] and [[Laajasalo]]-[[Herttoniemi]] areas. The sea front was further divided into six sectors, with sectors 1\u20134 at the old fortress, sector 5 at Melkki and sector 6 at Isosaari. The sea front was divided into main line of defence from Melkki to Isosaari and second line of defence from [[Lauttasaari]] to [[Santahamina]] at the end of 1914. As the new batteries were constructed Melkki was relegated to second line of defence and Lauttasaari to land front in spring 1915. At the land front new defensive lines were constructed from 1915 onward further away from the city center. The new land front was divided into three sectors: eastern, northern and western.<ref name=\"viapori/vyohyke\">{{cite web | url         = http://www.novision.fi/viapori/vyohyke.htm | title = Maarintaman linnoitusvy\u00f6hykkeet | first1 = John | last1 = Lagerstedt | first2 = Markku | last2 = Saari | year = 2000 | work = Krepost Sveaborg | language = Finnish |trans-title=Land front fortification zones | accessdate = 2010-05-23}}</ref> Krepost Sveaborg was also responsible for a larger fortification district that included coast line west of the fortress until [[Hanko]].<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|23\u201324}}\n\nAt the start of the war the fortification artillery units manning the fortress were organized into nine artillery companies and a machine gun detachment. In April 1915 the fortification artillery units were reorganized into a single fortification artillery regiment with three battalions and a machine gun company. Four companies manned the coastal forts at sea front. In June 1916 the regiment was divided in two, with 1st regiment responsible for the seaward defence and the 2nd for the landward defence. Both regiments had ten companies in three battalions. The 1st regiment was divided into three defence detachments, with south-western and south-eastern detachments responsible for the main line of defence on the outlying islands with the newest guns, while the third detachment manned the second line on the old fortress. The artillery regiments had a common supply unit responsible for the weapons, ammunition, transportation between islands etc. A signals company built and maintained the communication lines. The [[Naval mine|minefields]] around the fortress were built by the Krepost Sveaborg mine company, from 1915 a mine battalion. In 1916 the fortress was reinforced by the mine battalion from [[Vladivostok]] fortress. Construction and engineering department of the fortress headquarters organized the construction works of the fortress with engineering and sapper units as well as the civilian workers.<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|24\u201325}}\n\nInfantry units at the fortress manned the landward defences and provided detachments on the coastal forts for anti-landing and close defence duties. The peacetime Krepost Sveaborg fortress infantry regiment was reinforced by conscript units, which in 1915 were organized as the 427th and 428th infantry regiments to a new 107th infantry division which was sent to front line after a training period. In spring 1916 regiments from the new 116th division manned the fortress. At the autumn of 1916 units from different fortresses were brought to Krepost Sveaborg and organized into the 128th infantry division. In July 1917 the fortress was manned by the fortress infantry regiment and the 428th Lodeynoye Pole infantry regiment of the 128th division. In October 1917 the 128th was replaced by the [[29th Infantry Division (Russian Empire)|29th infantry division]], badly mauled at the front and brought to Krepost Sveaborg for rest. At January\u2013February 1918, when Finland gained its independence, Krepost Sveaborg had six infantry regiments: the 696th revolutionary regiment, the fortress infantry regiment and 113th, 114th, 115th and 116th regiments of the 29th infantry division.<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|24\u201326}}\n\nConstruction workers included Russian soldiers but also Finnish civilian workers and forced labour using prisoners transported from far east. Finns were exempt from conscription, and thus there was available manpower for fortification works. The payment for fortification works was slightly above average for manual labour, and made it an attractive option particularly for many rural workers. In 1915 when large scale construction of fortifications around Finland began Russians instituted a work responsibility for Finns based on wartime emergency law to obtain the necessary labour force. To ease the manpower shortage Russians brought convicted prisoners from far east to Finland in summer 1916 as forced labour. Approximately 2000-3000 men, including Chinese, Kyrgyz and Tatars, were employed as [[lumberjack]]s around Espoo and [[Sipoo]]. Kyrgyz were mainly guards. Asian workers were transported back to Russia already in 1917 however, citing the workers to be unaccustomed to the northern climate and possible threat of rebellion. The total number of workers in not known, but an estimated 10 000 to 15 000 men were used in construction works around Helsinki and up to 100 000 total in Finland. Complicated bureaucracy delayed the construction works, and the supervision of the works was also poor, leading to a widespread graft.<ref name=\"viapori/rakentajat\">{{cite web| url = http://www.novision.fi/viapori/rakentajat.htm | title = Linnoitusty\u00f6t | first1 = John | last1 = Lagerstedt | first2 = Markku | last2 = Saari | year = 2000 | work = Krepost Sveaborg | language = Finnish |trans-title=Fortification works | accessdate = 2010-05-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://weegee.espoo.fi/museot/verkko/valli/vakuk.htm | title = Kuka kaivoi vallihaudat? | work = Kuka kaivoi vallihaudat | publisher = Espoon kaupunginmuseo | language = Finnish | trans-title = Who built the trenches? | accessdate = 2010-05-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110720181349/http://weegee.espoo.fi/museot/verkko/valli/vakuk.htm | archive-date = 2011-07-20 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n==Armament==\n\n===Coastal guns===\n\nThe most powerful coastal guns used at Krepost Sveaborg were the {{convert|10|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} 45 caliber model 1891 guns. They had a maximum range of {{convert|21|km|mi|abbr=on}} but suffered from primitive mountings: the heavy guns, weighing {{convert|51|MT|ST}}, were completely hand-operated resulting in slow traverse and elevation rates and exhausting the gun crews. The rate of fire was only one shot every two minutes and they were also not capable of penetrating the armour of newer warships: at the range of {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} they could penetrate {{convert|127|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} of armour at 90\u00b0 angle. First four guns were transported to the fortress in 1913 from Kronstadt fortress, two guns each from Constantin and Obrutshev forts. Twelve guns were transported from Vladivostok in 1914 and eight more arrived in 1915, with a total of 24 guns in six four-gun batteries.<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|34\u201336}} These guns formed the primary armament of the sea front main line of defence.

These guns were [[France|French]] [[Canet guns]] and had a maximum range of {{convert|13|-|14|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Unlike the 10&nbsp;inch guns, the 6&nbsp;inch guns had a modern counter-recoil system and achieved a rate of fire of five shots per minute. The six inch guns were intended against [[destroyer]]s and other smaller vessels. They were installed in four batteries of four guns each at the sea front on [[Miessaari]], [[Harmaja]], Isosaari and [[Santahamina]]. A fifth battery was under construction on the mainland at Skatanniemi cape. The guns for this battery arrived, bringing the total sea front number to twenty, but the construction was not completed before the war ended. Further seventeen guns on lower ship deck mountings with lower maximum elevation were used on the land front. The guns used at Krepost Sveaborg included both Russian [[Obukhov State Plant|Obukhov]] licence-produced guns and French [[Schneider-Creusot|Schneider]] guns.<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|27\u201328,34\u201336}}\n\nThe older heavy coastal artillery pieces, the {{convert|9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|11|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} model 1867 and 1877 guns and the [[9-inch mortar M1877|{{convert|9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}]] and [[11-inch mortar M1877|{{convert|11|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}]] model 1877 coastal mortars, were mostly transferred to land front or placed in reserve. Three batteries (twelve guns) of 11&nbsp;inch model 1877 guns were used throughout the war at the sea front second line of defence at Kustaanmiekka, Kuninkaansaari and Vallisaari.

Gun models included both older fixed carriage guns and more modern weapons with counter-recoil systems. The most common models were the 6&nbsp;inch siege gun model 1877 with a 190 [[pood]] version used on both field and fortress mounts and a lighter 120 pood barrel version on field carriage. 42 [[Line (length)|line]] ({{convert|107|mm|in|1|abbr=on|disp=or}}) battery gun model 1877 and [[87 mm light field gun M1877|34 line ({{convert|87|mm|in|1|abbr=on|disp=or}}) light field gun model 1877]] were other older field artillery pieces used at the fortress. [[76 mm divisional gun M1902|76 mm model 1902]] gun was a newer rapid fire field gun with a counter recoil system. The 76&nbsp;mm model 1902 gun was also used as an anti-aircraft gun on a modified \"Rosenberg\" mount. The land front weaponry also included a variety of smaller caliber anti-storming guns, caponier guns and other mixed artillery pieces. The reserve guns included different older models up to bronze-barrelled mortars.<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|34}}<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.novision.fi/viapori/aseet.htm | title = Krepost-Sveaborgin aseet | first1 = John | last1 = Lagerstedt | first2 = Markku | last2 = Saari | year = 2000 | work = Krepost Sveaborg | language = Finnish |trans-title=Weapons of Krepost-Sveaborg | accessdate = 2010-05-23}}</ref>\n\n{{Gallery\n| title = Field guns of Krepost Sveaborg\n|File:152mm m1877 190 pood gun 2.jpg|6 inch 190 pood barrel model 1877 siege gun\n|File:6-inch siege gun M1877 120 pood version 1.JPG|6 inch 120 pood barrel model 1877 siege gun\n|File:152 22 D Suomenlinna 2.JPG|6 inch model 1877 siege gun on fortress carriage\n|File:Model 1877 107mm gun 2.jpg|42 line model 1877 battery gun\n|File:Model 1877 87 mm Russian Field Gun 2.jpg|34 line model 1877 field gun\n|File:76 mm m1902 suomenlinna helsinki 1.jpg|76 mm model 1902 field gun\n}}\n\n===Mines===\n\n[[Naval mine]]s were also used to protect Krepost Sveaborg from an attack from the sea. An outer line of contact mines was laid approximately {{convert|15|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} outside the main line of defence. Shore detonated [[controlled mines]] were used to create an inner mine barrier to protect the entrances to the outer anchorage. These mines were laid typically in three rows with {{convert|200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} separation between rows and {{convert|60|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} between mines in a row. Controlled mines required an extensive cabling system to the shore stations where the command to detonate the mines was given. Fortified electrical stations provided the necessary electricity for the mine control network. Electricity was also used for communication systems, searchlights, electrical ammunition lifts and in barracks and crew shelters.<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|45\u201347}}<ref name=\"Suomenlinna_linnoitus_i_maailmansodassa\"/>\n\n==Equipment==\n\n===Rangefinders===\n\n[[Depression position finder|Vertical based rangefinders]], where the known base length is the height of the [[rangefinder]] from sea level, were first used at Viapori in the 1880s. Vertical based rangefinders required only one instrument, but they were susceptible to interference from vibration caused by firing of the guns. Vertical based rangefinders also required a substantially high measurement site that was a problem on the low islands. To measure distance with reasonable accuracy to a target {{convert|10|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} away the rangefinder had to be at least 10 [[fathom]]s ({{convert|21.3|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and preferably 20 fathoms ({{convert|42.6|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) high - often impossible to achieve. Measurement sites had usually the rangefinder on a stone or masonry column {{convert|110|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} high lying on a granite foundation. The measurement pavilions had simple wooden walls and sheet metal roof protecting them from the elements and were {{convert|4|-|6|m2|sqft|0|abbr=on}} in size. Vertical rangefinders were no longer used on the new forts built on the outer islands.<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|40}}\n\nDistance measurement at the {{convert|10|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} model 1891 batteries was based on horizontal [[triangulation]] from two different points, a primary and secondary, on separate islands. The rangefinders used were general von der Launitz's models 1903 and 1905\u201307. The average distance between the two points at Krepost Sveaborg was {{convert|5.5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. Target information was sent from the primary point to the battery command point. If the primary point was located away from the battery or directing a different battery a rangefinder converter designed by colonel Kovanko was used to calculate the firing solution. A weakness in using two measurement points was that any malfunctions in either of the rangefinders or in the telephone system would render the system inoperable. Target indication between the primary and secondary points could also pose problems, as there would often be several similar target ships. The system was also not capable of measuring distances to targets in the rear of the battery; a maximum measurement sector was 140\u00b0.<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|41\u201342}}\n\nOn the smaller {{convert|6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} model 1892 Canet gun and anti-aircraft batteries {{convert|3|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] [[Coincidence rangefinder|stereoscopic rangefinders]] were used. Maximum distance that could be reliably measured with three meter rangefinders was {{convert|8|-|10|km|mi|abbr=on}}, while the maximum range of the six inch guns was {{convert|13|-|14|km|mi|abbr=on}}. A single {{convert|6|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} rangefinder was used by the commander of the artillery in a central fire control station at Kuivasaari. Six meter rangefinders were also planned for the 10&nbsp;inch batteries later in the war but never obtained.<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|42\u201343}}\n\n===Searchlights===\n\nSearchlights were first used at Viapori during the Russo-Turkish War in 1878, and they were originally intended for guarding the controlled mine barriers. During the First World War fortified searchlight positions were part of the coastal forts. The main line of defence had larger two {{convert|200|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} searchlights at Rys\u00e4kari and Kuivasaari and an additional six smaller {{convert|150|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} searchlights beside them and on the other islands. Miessaari 150&nbsp;cm searchlight position was not completed during the war. In the second line 150&nbsp;cm searchlights were used on Kuninkaansaari and Vallisaari, while other forts had {{convert|110|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} or {{convert|90|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} searchlights. [[Diesel generator]]s provided the necessary electrical power to operate the searchlights. Searchlights were used in disappearing positions, where the searchlight was normally in a shelter and only exposed when needed for illumination. The disappearing positions had two types: either the searchlight was raised from the shelter by a lifting mechanism, or it was moved by rails from the shelter to position.<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|43\u201344}}\n\n===Communications===\n\nTelephone and telegraph system linked the various parts of the fortress. Krepost Sveaborg had both a regular telephone system and a second, independent telephone network dedicated for fire control. The primary telephone exchange was located on Iso Mustasaari. The various island forts had their own telephone exchanges, while Kuivasaari and Isosaari had central coastal telephone exchanges with links to other main line of defence forts. The telephone cabels on main line of defence were usually buried, while second line used overhead lines. Besides telephone [[optical telegraph]]s, [[signal lamp]]s and [[signal flag]]s were also used.<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|46}}\n\n==Land front==\n\nTo protect Krepost Sveaborg and the naval base in particular from a German attack from land the fortifications were built to protect the fortress. The first fortifications were hastily built in 1914 to block access to the Helsinki peninsula and to guard the eastern flank of [[Laajasalo]] and [[Santahamina]] by a scarce line of fortifications at [[Ruskeasuo]]-[[Pasila]]-[[K\u00e4pyl\u00e4]]-[[Koskela]]-[[Viikki]]-[[Herttoniemi]]-[[Roihuvuori]]. [[Lauttasaari]], [[Meilahti]] and Laajasalo were also fortified to some extent. It was also planned to fortify [[Kulosaari]] and [[Vartiosaari]]. These first fortifications were field fortifications located {{convert|6|-|7|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city center, with the defence concentrated at fortified hilltop [[redoubt]]s.<ref name=\"rky\"/><ref name=\"viapori/vyohyke\"/>\n\nIn early 1915 it was decided to build new defenses further away from the city center. The new defenses were stronger fixed fortifications with positions quarried into rock or dug into ground. Fortifications were built from wood and stone masonry as well as concrete. New fortifications had a network of defensive structures, with trenches, rifle pits, machine gun nests, [[Wire obstacle|barbed wire obstacles]], shelters and roads. Artillery batteries were located {{convert|0.5|-|1.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} behind the front line, often located on reverse slope. Artillery batteries had 2\u20136, typically four, guns. Heavily fortified caponiers providing flanking fire were built on places of the front line. First a northern line was built at [[Lepp\u00e4vaara]]-[[Kaarela]]-[[Pakila]]-[[Pukinm\u00e4ki]]-[[Myllypuro]]-[[Vartiokyl\u00e4]]. Construction on a western line from Lepp\u00e4vaara to [[Westend, Espoo|Westend]] via [[Tapiola]] began shortly afterwards. In late 1915 it was decided to build an outer line of defence on the northern and eastern sectors, extending the fortifications northward and in the east from Pukinm\u00e4ki to [[Malmi, Helsinki|Malmi]], [[Mellunkyl\u00e4]] and [[Vuosaari]]. Fortification works continued until the February revolution of 1917, and some work was done until early 1918. The land front was divided into three sectors, eastern, northern and western with 36 bases, numbered I-XXXVII. The bases were usually centered on hilltops with the strongest defences.<ref name=\"rky\"/><ref name=\"viapori/vyohyke\"/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.novision.fi/viapori/system.htm | title  = Linnoitusj\u00e4rjestelm\u00e4 | first1 = John | last1 = Lagerstedt | first2 = Markku | last2 = Saari | year = 2000 | work = Krepost Sveaborg | language = Finnish |trans-title=Fortification system | accessdate  = 2010-05-23}}</ref><ref name=\"vallihaudat/linnoitteet\">{{cite web | url = http://weegee.espoo.fi/museot/verkko/valli/vamuo.htm | title = Mist\u00e4 linnoitteet muodostuivat? | work = Kuka kaivoi vallihaudat | publisher = Espoon kaupunginmuseo | language = Finnish | trans-title = What structures formed the fortifications? | accessdate = 2010-05-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110720181513/http://weegee.espoo.fi/museot/verkko/valli/vamuo.htm | archive-date = 2011-07-20 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nThe basic front line fortifications were open or covered machine gun nests, rifle pits, observation posts and shelters.

During the war new fortifications were built on the outlying islands pushing the defences outward to protect the ships in the harbour from new modern guns. During the First World War the naval front of the fortress was modernized almost completely. The new gun batteries can be divided into four types: heavy long range batteries, close range batteries, anti-landing batteries equipped with field guns and anti-aircraft batteries which appeared during the war for the first time. The naval front was divided into six sectors at the start of the war with sectors 1-4 comprising the old fortress, sector 5 Isosaari and sector 6 Melkki. The central fire control post was located in Vallisaari. As the new coastal forts were completed the organization changed and the naval front was divided into two parts: an outer main line of defence from Melkki to Isosaari and an inner second line of defence from Lauttasaari to Santahamina. The naval front command post was located in Vallisaari and the main artillery command post in Kuivasaari.<ref name=\"Manninen\"/>{{rp|23\u201324}}\n\nThe long range batteries of {{convert|10|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} guns included ten batteries with six 10&nbsp;inch batteries and four 6&nbsp;inch batteries, with one more under construction. The basic shape of the batteries is four guns in a row protected from the front by a concrete parapet of approximately {{convert|5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} thick with traversal walls between the gun positions. The batteries had no rear protection. Shelter for crew and ammunition cellars were built into and under the front parapet and the traversal walls. While the basic plan is similar, each battery is unique depending on the terrain. For the 10&nbsp;inch guns the average distance between guns is {{convert|40|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, but on smaller island such as Katajaluoto the guns are only {{convert|30|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} apart while the larger Isosaari battery (No 1) has guns {{convert|50|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} apart. Similarly the 6&nbsp;inch batteries have guns {{convert|35|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} apart on average, but in the very cramped Harmaja battery the distance between guns is only {{convert|20|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and the battery is not built on straight line but in a crooked L-shape. Many batteries have an [[icon]] closet framed with granite.<ref name=\"Manninen\"/>{{rp|27\u201328}}\n\n===Main line of defence===\n\nThe main line of defence was the outer seaward defence of Krepost Sveaborg. The main line of defence had the newest fortifications and the heaviest and most modern armament. At the end of the war, it comprised (from west to east): Miessaari and Py\u00f6r\u00e4saari, Rys\u00e4kari, katajaluoto, Harmaja, Kuivasaari, Isosaari, Santahamina and It\u00e4-Villinki islands and Skatanniemi cape.<ref name=\"Manninen\"/>{{rp|51}} The living conditions on the small, exposed islands were often poor, and the food supply was arranged from the older parts of the fortification with a week's supply of canned food, sugar and other compact food products stored on the islands.

They are located near the coast of [[Espoo]], and protected the coastal routes on the western flank of the fortress. Miessaari naval front battery number 40 had four {{convert|6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} Canet guns, while Py\u00f6r\u00e4saari had two two-gun batteries of light 57&nbsp;mm guns. Py\u00f6r\u00e4saari was connected to Miessaari by a bridge in 1917. The construction of the Canet gun battery began in spring 1915, the guns were installed in May 1916 and the construction was mostly finished by early 1917, though some work on the interior shelters continued until summer 1917. Py\u00f6r\u00e4saari 57&nbsp;mm gun positions were quarried in late autumn 1915 and completed in June 1916. The islands also formed the seam between naval and land fronts, and Miessaari had also a land-facing battery number 115 of six {{convert|6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} 190 pood model 1877 siege guns, supporting the base XXXIV in [[Haukilahti]]-[[Westend, Espoo|Westend]] area.<ref name=\"Manninen\"/>{{rp|51\u201354}}<ref>{{cite web | url = http://weegee.espoo.fi/museot/verkko/valli/vamer.htm | title = Merilinnoitteet Espoossa | work = Kuka kaivoi vallihaudat | publisher = Espoon kaupunginmuseo | language = Finnish | trans-title = Coastal fortifications in Espoo | accessdate = 2010-05-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721050041/http://weegee.espoo.fi/museot/verkko/valli/vamer.htm | archive-date = 2011-07-21 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n====Rys\u00e4kari====\n\n[[Rys\u00e4kari]] island {{coord|60|6|3.95|N|24|49|55.27|E|region:FI_type:isle|display=inline}} had the westernmost 10-inch battery, and could command the western sea routes up to south-western shores of [[Porkkala]]nniemi peninsula. Construction of the battery located in the middle of the island began shortly after the war broke up, in October 1914. The guns, transported from Vladivostok, were installed by January 1915 and the entire battery with ammunition cellars and concrete command tower was finished in spring 1916.

A 10-inch battery built on the widest part divides the island into northern and southern parts. The construction of the battery began in October 1914 and the guns were placed on their foundations in early 1915 with the parapet and traversal walls completed in autumn 1915. Katajaluoto battery is the narrowest of the 10-inch batteries. The northern shore of the island has a heavily fortified concrete bunker used as mine control bunker, telephone exchange and electrical station. The island had a 150&nbsp;cm searchlight.

The island has been used as a pilot station and the current lighthouse was built in 1883. At the start of the war two {{convert|75|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} guns were placed on the island. These were relocated in October 1914 when construction of a 6-inch Canet battery began. The small island did not have the necessary building materials, and sand, gravel and cement had to be brought in with barges. The guns were installed in February 1915 and the battery was finished in September 1916.

After the war began construction of a 10-inch battery began on the western shore of the island. The guns, transported from Vladivostok, were placed on their foundations in February 1915 and the battery was finished in early winter of 1915. The main fire control station of the fortress with the only {{convert|6|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} rangefinder was located in Kuivasaari. The island also had a 150&nbsp;cm searchlight. Kuivasaari telephone exchange was also the central gunnery telephone exchange. A four-gun 75&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft battery on wooden platforms was located on the northern part of the island.<ref name=\"Manninen\"/>{{rp|62\u201365}}\n\n====Isosaari====\n\n[[Isosaari]] {{coord|60|6|7.19|N|25|3|8.76|E|region:FI_type:isle|display=inline}} is the largest of the outlying islands. The island's central location and size made it the most heavily armed coastal fort and it was part of the plans for expanding Krepost Sveaborg already in 1909. In May 1914 construction of four concrete fortified batteries began: one 10&nbsp;inch battery, one 11&nbsp;inch battery and two 6&nbsp;inch batteries. The start of the war hastened the consctruction works that had progressed slowly, and three 10&nbsp;inch guns were placed on temporary wooden platforms. The concrete batteries were finished by autumn 1915, but a change in plans resulted in the second 6-inch battery being located in Santahamina instead. In January 1916 work began to modify the 11-inch battery (battery number 2) for 10-inch guns, with the modifications complete in 1916. The first 10-inch battery is located on the south-western tip of the island, while the other two batteries are on the south-eastern shore. A 150&nbsp;cm searchlight was located near the first 10-inch battery and a 200&nbsp;cm searchlight near the two other batteries. A narrow gauge [[Trench railways|military railway]] was built on the island to transport supplies and ammunition.<ref name=\"Manninen\"/>{{rp|65\u201371}}\n\n====Santahamina====\n\n[[Santahamina]] {{coord|60|8|44.18|N|25|3|1.96|E|region:FI_type:isle|display=inline}} was the largest single island in Krepost Sveaborg, and is located south of [[Laajasalo]]. Because of the size of the island Santahamina could be considered to belong to both main line of defence and the second line of defence. Santahamina was fortified during the Crimean War, and several gun batteries were built on the island during the decades between Crimean War and First World War. Most of the older guns, including eleven 6&nbsp;inch 190 pood siege guns and thirteen 9&nbsp;inch coastal mortars, were transported to the land front of the fortress shortly after the start of war. The remaining batteries were a 6-inch Canet battery, originally intended for Isosaari, at It\u00e4niemi on the south-eastern part of the island and a 75&nbsp;mm battery on the eastern shore. These batteries covered the sea east of Isosaari. Santahamina had a large garrison area and a substantial number of troops and supplies were located on the island.<ref name=\"Manninen\"/>{{rp|71\u201377}}\n\n====It\u00e4-Villinki====\n\n[[It\u00e4-Villinki]] {{coord|60|9|28.63|N|25|8|15.9|E|region:FI_type:isle|display=inline}} is located just east of the larger [[Villinki]] island. The island was a summer house district and the land had to be expropriated from the owners. Resistance by the land owners delayed the process, and was still not fully complete by late 1916. Fortification works for an 11-inch battery began in April 1915, but the battery was changed to 10&nbsp;inch guns in autumn of the same year. 10&nbsp;inch battery is built on a rock hilltop at the centre of the island.

The fighting power of the second line was limited to quick-firing 75&nbsp;mm and 57&nbsp;mm guns and old 11&nbsp;inch cannons and mortars. The primary combat objective of the batteries on the second line was to prevent enemy ships from passing through Kustaanmiekansalmi or S\u00e4rk\u00e4nsalmi straits to the inner anchorage on Kruunuvuorenselk\u00e4.

During the First World War the only battery was a land front battery number 116 at Vaskiniemi, armed with four {{convert|9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} model 1867 guns in March 1915. This battery supported base XXXVII located in southern Espoo at [[Tapiola]]\u2014[[Otaniemi]] area. The only naval front connection Lauttasaari had was an unfinished searchlight station in L\u00e4nsiulapanniemi and bakery constructed between 1916 and 1917 near the land front battery that was also used to supply the coastal forts on the nearby islands.<ref name=\"Manninen\"/>{{rp|83\u201385}} Lauttasaari was officially delegated to land front already in spring 1915.<ref name=\"Manninen\"/>{{rp|23\u201324}}\n\n====Melkki====\n\n[[Melkki]] {{coord|60|7|54.65|N|24|53|17.97|E|region:FI_type:isle|display=inline}} is located south of Lauttasaari.

The Canet battery was relocated to Harmaja, and the 11&nbsp;inch guns were used only for a short period on temporary wooden platforms. A 75&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft battery was located on the island in October 1914.

As the war began the 6&nbsp;inch guns were relocated to the land front while the 9&nbsp;inch guns were decommissioned and left in their positions. The two 57&nbsp;mm guns and two more guns from Vallisaari were relocated to a new field fortified battery on the southern tip of the island.

It included the islands of Kustaanmiekka, Susisaari, Iso Mustasaari, Pikku Mustasaari, L\u00e4nsi-Mustasaari, S\u00e4rkk\u00e4 and the [[skerry]] of Pormestarinluoto. Except for the smaller S\u00e4rkk\u00e4 and Pormestarinluoto the islands were connected by bridges or joined together. The islands housed the fortress commander and headquarters along with the main telephone exchange and the largest dry dock in Finland at the time. The citadel also had weapons and ammunition depots and other storage areas. Most of the fortification works were concentrated on other islands, and of the older armament only one battery of three 11&nbsp;inch guns remained in active service in Kustaanmiekka island. To guard Kustaanmiekansalmi strait two batteries of 57&nbsp;mm guns were built, one on Kustaanmiekka and one on Iso-Mustasaari island.

The two islands were joined by a [[causeway]] across Kukisalmi strait at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. From the late 19th century until the First World War Vallisaari was the most heavily fortified island of the fortress. Construction of a 6-inch Canet battery on the island began in 1912, but the guns were relocated to the outer islands on the new main line of defence at the beginning of the war. Of the older guns a five-gun battery of 11&nbsp;inch model 1877 guns and six-gun battery of 11&nbsp;inch mortars were still used during the war. Two of the mortars were transported to the land front in early 1915, and the rest were decommissioned and abandoned on their positions in 1916. A six-gun battery of 6&nbsp;inch model 1877 siege guns on fortress carriages were transported to the land front by the end of 1914. Newer artillery included two 57&nbsp;mm guns that were replaced with four 75&nbsp;mm guns in October 1914. Of the Kuninkaansaari batteries one four-gun battery of 11&nbsp;inch model 1877 guns was kept in service. Two of the five 11&nbsp;inch mortars were also in use until 1915. The rest of the guns - five 9&nbsp;inch model 1867 guns, four 6&nbsp;inch model 1877 siege guns, two (possibly four) 9&nbsp;inch mortars and three 11&nbsp;inch mortars were moved to the land front shortly after the start of the war. Both Vallisaari and Kuninkaansaari had a 150&nbsp;cm searchlight stations.

The island is located in Kruunuvuorenselk\u00e4 where the inner anchorage of the fortress was, between Suomenlinna, Santahamina and Laajasalo. Three large fuel oil tanks served the naval base and two smaller diesel tanks provided fuel for the mine company (later battalion) ships of the fortress. A pumping station powered by steam engine was connected to the tanks. Eight storage magazines housed weapons, ammunition, mines and torpedoes with a narrow gauge railway built on the island connecting them to the main pier. At the start of the war a 57&nbsp;mm quick fire battery was located on the island, replaced by a 75&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft battery in spring 1915. The anti-aircraft battery was relocated in summer 1916. A 90&nbsp;cm searchlight was also located on the island.<ref name=\"Manninen\"/>{{rp|109\u2013117}}\n\n==Finnish Civil War==\n\nKrepost Sveaborg never did see action against Germany in Russian hands. After the Russian revolution the [[treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] ended Russia's participation in the First World War. The treaty affirmed the independence of Finland and required Russian troops to leave from the country. Of the approximately 35 000 Russian soldiers and sailors who were around Helsinki in January 1918 most were demobilized and sent home or simply left by 15 March. Around one thousand joined the Finnish [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red Guards]] in the Finnish Civil War. The Soviet leadership ordered Krepost Sveaborg headquarters to begin preparations to abandon the fortress and destroy what could not be evacuated in case it would fall into German hands. Some field guns were transported to Russia, but all the coastal guns were left. On 3 April 1918 German [[Baltic Sea Division]] landed in [[Hanko]], after being requested by the White [[Senate of Finland|Senate of Vaasa]] to participate in the Finnish Civil War against the Reds. Russian Baltic fleet officers had made an agreement with the Germans allowing a safe departure for the warships and disarming the fortress. Most of the Russian ships left by mid-April, but the last ships left only in May\u2013June 1918. The disarmament - removing locks from the guns, cutting the cables controlling the mines and destroying the mine control stations - had to be done in secret as an agreement between Soviet government and Finnish Red Guards had promised the latter all the fortifications. When the Germans arrived in Helsinki the Red Guard could only use some of the land front fortifications in Lepp\u00e4vaara and Ruskeasuo, and the Germans with a well equipped and trained numerically superior force quickly captured Helsinki between 11th and 13 April. The Russian guards ceded the coastal forts to Germans according to their agreement. The disarmament of Krepost Sveaborg, denying the Reds from using it, was used in White [[propaganda]] by how [[Allan Staffans]] had duped the Russians and removed the locks without authorization; but actually the disarmament occurred with the order of the fortress commander and with the knowledge of naval headquarters.<ref>{{cite news |last=Salonen |first=Juha |title=Riisuttiinko Viapori aseista huijauksella vai merilinnakkeen johdon tietoisella tuella? |url=http://www.hs.fi/paivanlehti/arkisto/Riisuttiinko+Viapori+aseista+huijauksella+vai+merilinnakkeen+johdon+tietoisella+tuella/aaHS20080322SI2KA0286n?src=haku&ref=arkisto%2F |accessdate=2014-03-30 |date=2008-03-22 |newspaper=[[Helsingin Sanomat]] |publisher=Sanoma News Oy |language=Finnish |trans-title=Was Viapori disarmed with a ploy or with knowledge and support of the sea fortress command?}}</ref> On 12 May Krepost Sveaborg was renamed ''Suomenlinna'' to celebrate the new independency.<ref name=\"Manninen\"/>{{rp|20\u201321}}<ref name=\"rky\"/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://weegee.espoo.fi/museot/verkko/valli/vakay.htm | title = Linnoituslaitteet k\u00e4yt\u00f6ss\u00e4 - ensimm\u00e4isen ja ainoan kerran | work = Kuka kaivoi vallihaudat | publisher = Espoon kaupunginmuseo | language = Finnish | trans-title = Fortification in action - for the first and last time | accessdate = 2010-05-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721050117/http://weegee.espoo.fi/museot/verkko/valli/vakay.htm | archive-date = 2011-07-21 | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.novision.fi/viapori/sotilaat.htm | title = Sotilaat ja taistelut | first1 = John | last1 = Lagerstedt | first2 = Markku | last2 = Saari | year = 2000 | work = Krepost Sveaborg | language = Finnish |trans-title=Soldiers and battles | accessdate = 2010-05-23}}</ref>\n\n==Later history==\n\nAfter First World War the fortifications of Krepost Sveaborg were taken over by Finland. Most of the land front fortifications were disarmed, stripped of useful equipment and abandoned. Much of the land front fortifications with steel reinforcements were destroyed in the inter war period and the steel sold as scrap. During the [[Second World War]] an inventory of the land front fortifications was conducted regarding their usefulness, with the larger shelters quarried into the rock under particular interest as facilities for war industry, emergency hospitals or storage. Some of the land front shelters are still used as storage space. As settlement spread during the urbanization after the Second World War many of the fortifications were destroyed as new suburbs were constructed. The coastal fortifications were used by the Finnish coastal artillery to protect Helsinki. Most of the islands remained in military use and were thus spared from vandalism. All structures of the Krepost Sveaborg fortifications around Helsinki, both land and sea fronts, were declared protected historical sites by the [[Finnish National Board of Antiquities]] in 1971.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://weegee.espoo.fi/museot/verkko/valli/va80.htm | title = Linnoituksen asema 80 vuotta my\u00f6hemmin | work = Kuka kaivoi vallihaudat | publisher = Espoon kaupunginmuseo | language = Finnish | trans-title = Fortification 80 years later | accessdate = 2010-05-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721050127/http://weegee.espoo.fi/museot/verkko/valli/va80.htm | archive-date = 2011-07-21 | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref name=\"viapori/nyky\u00e4\u00e4n\">{{cite web | url = http://www.novision.fi/viapori/nyky.htm | title = Helsingin maa- ja merilinnoitus nyky\u00e4\u00e4n | first1 = John\n| last1 = Lagerstedt | first2 = Markku | last2 = Saari | year = 2000 | work = Krepost Sveaborg | language = Finnish |trans-title=Helsinki land and sea fortress today | accessdate = 2010-05-23}}</ref>\n\n===Present day condition===\n\nWhile much of land front fortifications have been destroyed, many areas have been more or less preserved and some sections have been partly restored.

In Helsinki trees threatening the structure of one of the older 1914 redoubts in Rajakallio have been cut, and the city planning department has made a plan regarding the maintenance of the cleared areas and restoring new ones. Of the coastal forts, all main line of defence islands except Py\u00f6r\u00e4saari and Harmaja are still in military use and forbidden from civilians, and Harmaja is used by the Finnish Maritime Administration as a pilot station. A coastal artillery museum has been built on Kuivasaari and the island is no longer in active military use, but still officially restricted area. Visitors are allowed but only in organized tours. It is planned to transfer Kuivasaari, together with Rys\u00e4kari, into civilian authorities. Skatanniemi cape is the only area of the main line of defence that is easily visited.

The purpose of the fortress was to provide a secure naval base for the Russian [[Baltic fleet]] and to protect Helsinki and block routes to [[Saint Petersburg]] from a possible [[Germany|German]] invasion. Krepost Sveaborg was part of [[Peter the Great's Naval Fortress]], a coastal fortification system protecting access to Saint Petersburg by sea. The central part of Krepost Sveaborg was the old fortress of [[Suomenlinna]] where the fortress headquarters were located. Due to technological advances in artillery the old fortress was no longer capable of providing a sufficient protection, and a new main defensive line was built well beyond the old fortress boundaries. New [[coastal artillery]] guns built on outlying islands protected Krepost Sveaborg from the sea, while fortified lines constructed around Helsinki were intended to stop any attacks on land. The primary coastal guns were [[254mm 45 caliber Pattern 1891|{{convert|10|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} model 1891 guns]] and [[152 mm 45 caliber Pattern 1892|{{convert|6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} model 1892]] [[Canet gun]]s. Older [[11-inch gun M1877|{{convert|11|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} model 1877 guns]] were also used. In summer 1917 the fortress had two hundred coastal or anti-landing guns, of which 24 were 10-inch guns in six batteries, 16 were 6-inch Canet guns in four batteries and twelve were 11-inch guns in three batteries.<ref name=\"Manninen\">{{Cite book | last = Manninen | first = Markus | title = Viapori - Merilinnoitus ensimm\u00e4isess\u00e4 maailmansodassa 1914\u20141918 [Viapori - Sea fortress during the First World War 1914-1918] | publisher = Sotamuseo | year = 2000 | isbn = 951-25-1137-1}}</ref>{{rp|31}} The artillery used in land fortifications included older coastal guns, old fixed carriage guns and newer light field guns.

Some further construction work was carried out during the remaining year, but all work halted during the [[October Revolution]]. Following the [[Finnish Declaration of Independence]], parts of the land fortifications were used in the [[Finnish Civil War]]. The coastal fortifications were later taken over by Finland to protect Helsinki, while the land fortifications were mostly abandoned and disarmed.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://weegee.espoo.fi/museot/verkko/valli/vamik.htm | title = Miksi linnoitteet rakennettiin? | work = Kuka kaivoi vallihaudat | publisher = Espoon kaupunginmuseo | language = Finnish | trans-title = Why the fortifications were built | accessdate = 2010-05-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100717235328/http://weegee.espoo.fi/museot/verkko/valli/vamik.htm | archive-date = 2010-07-17 | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref name=\"rky\">{{cite web | url = http://www.rky.fi/read/asp/r_kohde_det.aspx?KOHDE_ID=1570 | title = P\u00e4\u00e4kaupunkiseudun I maailmansodan linnoitteet | date = 2009-12-22 | work = Valtakunnallisesti merkitt\u00e4v\u00e4t rakennetut kulttuuriymp\u00e4rist\u00f6t\n| publisher   = [[Finnish National Board of Antiquities|Museovirasto]]| language = Finnish |trans-title=First World War fortifications in the capital area | accessdate = 2010-05-23}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\n[[Sweden]] had ceded [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] to [[Russian Empire]] as the result of the [[Finnish War]] of 1808\u20141809 and along with it the fortress of [[Sveaborg]], {{lang-fi|'''Viapori'''}}, the present day Suomenlinna. The fortress protected the southern Finland and became a naval base for the Russian Baltic Fleet. After the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] many new buildings were built to improve the living conditions on the fortress, but the fortifications were neglected. After the start of the [[Crimean War]] in 1853 construction of new fortifications began on the other nearby islands and on the southern shore of Helsinki peninsula. In 1854 an Anglo-French naval fleet entered the [[Baltic Sea]], hastening the work. These fortifications protected the flanks of the fortress and provided depth to the defence, but the problem of obsolescent artillery was not solved. Thus when the fleet attacked the fortress on the 6th of August 1855 they were able to bombard the fortress for two days from a distance of {{convert|4|-|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} while the best Russian guns had a maximum range of {{convert|2500|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|9\u201311}}<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.suomenlinna.fi/linnoitus/linnoitusjarjestelma/krimin_sota | title = Linnoitus vuosina 1808 - 1856 | work = Suomenlinnan merilinnoituksen viralliset sivut | publisher = Suomenlinnan hoitokunta | language = Finnish | trans-title = Fortress between 1808 - 1856 | accessdate = 2010-05-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100504091302/http://www.suomenlinna.fi/linnoitus/linnoitusjarjestelma/krimin_sota | archive-date = 2010-05-04 | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Suomenlinna_vallanvaihdosta_krimin_sotaan\">{{cite web | url = http://www.suomenlinna.fi/linnoitus/historia/venajan_vallan_aika/vallanvaihdosta_krimin_sotaan | title = Vallanvaihdosta Krimin sotaan | work = Suomenlinnan merilinnoituksen viralliset sivut | publisher = Suomenlinnan hoitokunta | language = Finnish | trans-title = From change of authority to Crimean War | accessdate = 2010-05-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100504090347/http://www.suomenlinna.fi/linnoitus/historia/venajan_vallan_aika/vallanvaihdosta_krimin_sotaan | archive-date = 2010-05-04 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nAfter Crimean War fortifications of Viapori were improved by building artillery [[casemate]]s and new bomb-proof buildings. Vallisaari just east of Suomenlinna was the site of the first new construction works. The harsh suppression of the [[Poland|Polish]] [[January Uprising]] of 1863 and the resulting criticism soured the relationships between Russia and western Europe and hastened the fortification works. Between 1863 and 1864 [[redoubt]]s were built on Vallisaari, Kuninkaansaari and Santahamina islands. In 1860s and 1870s Russia purchased and then built under license new [[Prussia]]n [[Krupp]] rifled breech loading guns which were also used in Viapori. A total of 32 new bomb-proof stone powder cellars were built by the beginning of the 1870s, further improving the defences. The [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878]] was the next crisis that threatened the peace between Russia and England, with new batteries being built at Viapori on Kuninkaansaari and older ones improved or rebuilt. New technology in the form of [[Electrical telegraph|telegraph]], [[railway]] lines and [[searchlight]]s began to be used. Improvements in artillery and ammunition forced improving the gun positions by covering the old walls and fortifications with a thick earthen walls. With high-explosive shells appearing at the end of the 19th century earth and stone were no longer sufficient and first concrete fortifications with steel doors were built in Viapori. Continually improving guns resulted increased range, necessitating [[Coincidence rangefinder|rangefinder]]s, while heavier guns and ammunition required improving piers, roads, cranes and ammunition carts to transport the guns or move ammunition from magazines to guns. Despite the improvements the funds and resources allocated to the fortress were not sufficient to keep pace with the evolution of military technology. While parts of the fortress or were improved and new weapons or equipment were received, the overall condition of the fortress became ever more obsolescent, and the vulnerability of the flanks and rear were a lasting problem. By the end of 1880s and early 1890s Viapori could no longer be considered a proper fortress but only a coastal position, capable of defending only against an enemy coming directly from the sea. The primary role of the fortress became more one of internal politics, as it helped the Russians maintain control of Helsinki.<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|12\u201315}}<ref name=\"Suomenlinna_vallanvaihdosta_krimin_sotaan\"/><ref name=\"Suomenlinna_sodan_jalkeiset_uudistukset\">{{cite web | url = http://www.suomenlinna.fi/linnoitus/linnoitusjarjestelma/sodan_jalkeiset_uudistukset | title = Sodan j\u00e4lkeiset uudistukset | work = Suomenlinnan merilinnoituksen viralliset sivut | publisher = Suomenlinnan hoitokunta | language = Finnish | trans-title = Improvements after the war | accessdate = 2010-05-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100504091007/http://www.suomenlinna.fi/linnoitus/linnoitusjarjestelma/sodan_jalkeiset_uudistukset | archive-date = 2010-05-04 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n==Krepost Sveaborg==\n\nIn the 1890s the priority of the fortification works in the Baltic Sea had been the protection of the ice-free port of [[Liep\u0101ja]], and the [[Kronstadt]] fortress protecting Saint Petersburg, relegating Viapori to a secondary status. After the losses during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] and in light of the rising might of the [[Imperial German Navy]], Liep\u0101ja was considered too vulnerable for a main fleet base, and the decision to build Peter the Great's Naval Fortress was made. In the new plans the main line of defence against the enemy was at the [[Porkkala]]-[[Tallinn]] line with Tallinn also the new main base for the Russian Baltic Fleet. Helsinki was to be a base for torpedo boat flotillas. The construction of the Tallinn naval base was delayed however, and with the new ships being constructed to replace the losses suffered against Japan the Russian Navy was forced to rely more on Helsinki despite the obsolete armament and inadequate fortifications at Viapori. As the threat of war in Europe grew, it became essential to expand the fortress to provide a necessary protection for the naval base. Until 1910, when the first 152&nbsp;mm Canet guns arrived, the only modern weapons at Viapori were [[QF 6 pounder Nordenfelt|57 mm quick fire guns]] with the rest of the artillery designs dating from the Russo-Turkish War. The first new 254&nbsp;mm guns arrived in 1913, but it was not until early 1914 that construction of the first new batteries began on [[Melkki]] and [[Isosaari]]. During the First World War the new '''Krepost Sveaborg''' was built to substantially expand the old fortress. A new ''main line of defence'' was constructed on the outlying islands, pushing the defensive line several kilometers southward, thus providing a secure outer anchorage south of the old fortress for larger warships without the need to navigate the narrow straits leading to the inner anchorage at Kruunuvuorenselk\u00e4. The older parts of the fortress became a ''second line of defence'' and the main storage areas. The rear of the fortress was finally protected by land fortifications, at first field fortifications on the Helsinki peninsula built in 1914, and, later, an outer line of fixed fortifications.<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|15\u201317}}<ref name=\"rky\"/><ref name=\"Suomenlinna_linnoitus_i_maailmansodassa\">{{cite web | url = http://www.suomenlinna.fi/linnoitus/linnoitusjarjestelma/linnoitus_i_maailmansodassa | title = Linnoitus I maailmansodassa | work = Suomenlinnan merilinnoituksen viralliset sivut | publisher = Suomenlinnan hoitokunta | language = Finnish | trans-title = The fortress during the First World War | accessdate = 2010-05-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100504090710/http://www.suomenlinna.fi/linnoitus/linnoitusjarjestelma/linnoitus_i_maailmansodassa | archive-date = 2010-05-04 | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Suomenlinna_i_maailmansota\">{{cite web | url = http://www.suomenlinna.fi/linnoitus/historia/venajan_vallan_aika/i_maailmansota | title = I maailmansota | work = Suomenlinnan merilinnoituksen viralliset sivut | publisher = Suomenlinnan hoitokunta | language = Finnish | trans-title = First World War | accessdate = 2010-05-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110529163054/http://www.suomenlinna.fi/linnoitus/historia/venajan_vallan_aika/i_maailmansota | archive-date = 2011-05-29 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n==Troops and organization==\n\nAt the start of the First World War Krepost Sveaborg was subordinated to the Russian [[6th Army (Russian Empire)|6th Army]]. In summer 1916 Krepost Sveaborg was subordinated to Baltic Fleet. At the start of the war Krepost Sveaborg was divided into three defensive areas, with the sea front forming one defensive area and the land front divided to [[Pasila]] and [[Laajasalo]]-[[Herttoniemi]] areas. The sea front was further divided into six sectors, with sectors 1-4 at the old fortress, sector 5 at Melkki and sector 6 at Isosaari. The sea front was divided into main line of defence from Melkki to Isosaari and second line of defence from [[Lauttasaari]] to [[Santahamina]] at the end of 1914. As the new batteries were constructed Melkki was relegated to second line of defence and Lauttasaari to land front in spring 1915. At the land front new defensive lines were constructed from 1915 onward further away from the city center. The new land front was divided into three sectors: eastern, northern and western.<ref name=\"viapori/vyohyke\">{{cite web | url         = http://www.novision.fi/viapori/vyohyke.htm | title = Maarintaman linnoitusvy\u00f6hykkeet | first1 = John | last1 = Lagerstedt | first2 = Markku | last2 = Saari | year = 2000 | work = Krepost Sveaborg | language = Finnish |trans-title=Land front fortification zones | accessdate = 2010-05-23}}</ref> Krepost Sveaborg was also responsible for a larger fortification district that included coast line west of the fortress until [[Hanko]].<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|23\u201324}}\n\nAt the start of the war the fortification artillery units manning the fortress were organized into nine artillery companies and a machine gun detachment. In April 1915 the fortification artillery units were reorganized into a single fortification artillery regiment with three battalions and a machine gun company. Four companies manned the coastal forts at sea front. In June 1916 the regiment was divided in two, with 1st regiment responsible for the seaward defence and the 2nd for the landward defence. Both regiments had ten companies in three battalions. The 1st regiment was divided into three defence detachments, with south-western and south-eastern detachments responsible for the main line of defence on the outlying islands with the newest guns, while the third detachment manned the second line on the old fortress. The artillery regiments had a common supply unit responsible for the weapons, ammunition, transportation between islands etc. A signals company built and maintained the communication lines. The [[Naval mine|minefields]] around the fortress were built by the Krepost Sveaborg mine company, from 1915 a mine battalion. In 1916 the fortress was reinforced by the mine battalion from [[Vladivostok]] fortress. Construction and engineering department of the fortress headquarters organized the construction works of the fortress with engineering and sapper units as well as the civilian workers.<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|24\u201325}}\n\nInfantry units at the fortress manned the landward defences and provided detachments on the coastal forts for anti-landing and close defence duties. The peacetime Krepost Sveaborg fortress infantry regiment was reinforced by conscript units, which in 1915 were organized as the 427th and 428th infantry regiments to a new 107th infantry division which was sent to front line after a training period. In spring 1916 regiments from the new 116th division manned the fortress. At the autumn of 1916 units from different fortresses were brought to Krepost Sveaborg and organized into the 128th infantry division. In July 1917 the fortress was manned by the fortress infantry regiment and the 428th Lodeynoye Pole infantry regiment of the 128th division. In October 1917 the 128th was replaced by the [[29th Infantry Division (Russian Empire)|29th infantry division]], badly mauled at the front and brought to Krepost Sveaborg for rest. At January\u2013February 1918, when Finland gained its independence, Krepost Sveaborg had six infantry regiments: the 696th revolutionary regiment, the fortress infantry regiment and 113th, 114th, 115th and 116th regiments of the 29th infantry division.<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|24\u201326}}\n\nConstruction workers included Russian soldiers but also Finnish civilian workers and forced labour using prisoners transported from far east. Finns were exempt from conscription, and thus there was available manpower for fortification works. The payment for fortification works was slightly above average for manual labour, and made it an attractive option particularly for many rural workers. In 1915 when large scale construction of fortifications around Finland began Russians instituted a work responsibility for Finns based on wartime emergency law to obtain the necessary labour force. To ease the manpower shortage Russians brought convicted prisoners from far east to Finland in summer 1916 as forced labour. Approximately 2000-3000 men, including Chinese, Kyrgyz and Tatars, were employed as [[lumberjack]]s around Espoo and [[Sipoo]]. Kyrgyz were mainly guards. Asian workers were transported back to Russia already in 1917 however, citing the workers to be unaccustomed to the northern climate and possible threat of rebellion. The total number of workers in not known, but an estimated 10 000 to 15 000 men were used in construction works around Helsinki and up to 100 000 total in Finland. Complicated bureaucracy delayed the construction works, and the supervision of the works was also poor, leading to a widespread graft.<ref name=\"viapori/rakentajat\">{{cite web| url = http://www.novision.fi/viapori/rakentajat.htm | title = Linnoitusty\u00f6t | first1 = John | last1 = Lagerstedt | first2 = Markku | last2 = Saari | year = 2000 | work = Krepost Sveaborg | language = Finnish |trans-title=Fortification works | accessdate = 2010-05-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://weegee.espoo.fi/museot/verkko/valli/vakuk.htm | title = Kuka kaivoi vallihaudat? | work = Kuka kaivoi vallihaudat | publisher = Espoon kaupunginmuseo | language = Finnish | trans-title = Who built the trenches? | accessdate = 2010-05-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110720181349/http://weegee.espoo.fi/museot/verkko/valli/vakuk.htm | archive-date = 2011-07-20 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n==Armament==\n\n===Coastal guns===\n\nThe most powerful coastal guns used at Krepost Sveaborg were the {{convert|10|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} 45 caliber model 1891 guns. They had a maximum range of {{convert|21|km|mi|abbr=on}} but suffered from primitive mountings: the heavy guns, weighing {{convert|51|MT|ST}}, were completely hand-operated resulting in slow traverse and elevation rates and exhausting the gun crews. The rate of fire was only one shot every two minutes and they were also not capable of penetrating the armour of newer warships: at the range of {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} they could penetrate {{convert|127|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} of armour at 90\u00b0 angle. First four guns were transported to the fortress in 1913 from Kronstadt fortress, two guns each from Constantin and Obrutshev forts. Twelve guns were transported from Vladivostok in 1914 and eight more arrived in 1915, with a total of 24 guns in six four-gun batteries.<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|34\u201336}} These guns formed the primary armament of the sea front main line of defence. The batteries were located on [[Rys\u00e4kari]], [[Katajaluoto]], [[Kuivasaari]], Isosaari (two batteries) and [[It\u00e4-Villinki]].<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|27\u201328}}\n\nThe [[152 mm 45 caliber Pattern 1892|{{convert|6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} 45 caliber model 1892]] guns supplemented the 10&nbsp;inch guns of the sea front main line of defence. These guns were [[France|French]] [[Canet guns]] and had a maximum range of {{convert|13|-|14|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Unlike the 10&nbsp;inch guns, the 6&nbsp;inch guns had a modern counter-recoil system and achieved a rate of fire of five shots per minute. The six inch guns were intended against [[destroyer]]s and other smaller vessels. They were installed in four batteries of four guns each at the sea front on [[Miessaari]], [[Harmaja]], Isosaari and [[Santahamina]]. A fifth battery was under construction on the mainland at Skatanniemi cape. The guns for this battery arrived, bringing the total sea front number to twenty, but the construction was not completed before the war ended. Further seventeen guns on lower ship deck mountings with lower maximum elevation were used on the land front. The guns used at Krepost Sveaborg included both Russian [[Obukhov State Plant|Obukhov]] licence-produced guns and French [[Schneider-Creusot|Schneider]] guns.<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|27\u201328,34\u201336}}\n\nThe older heavy coastal artillery pieces, the {{convert|9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|11|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} model 1867 and 1877 guns and the [[9-inch mortar M1877|{{convert|9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}]] and [[11-inch mortar M1877|{{convert|11|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}]] model 1877 coastal mortars, were mostly transferred to land front or placed in reserve. Three batteries (twelve guns) of 11&nbsp;inch model 1877 guns were used throughout the war at the sea front second line of defence at Kustaanmiekka, Kuninkaansaari and Vallisaari. At the start of the war 11&nbsp;inch guns were also used at the main line of defence on Isosaari before 10&nbsp;inch model 1891 guns replaced them.<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|65\u201366}} Two batteries of 11&nbsp;inch coastal mortars remained in use until 1916 in Vallisaari and Kuninkaansaari. The mortars were also capable of firing to the rear of the fortress and were intended to keep the citizens of Helsinki loyal. The heavy shells of the mortars were considered to have a \"suitable moral effect\" ({{lang-fi|asianmukaisen moraalisen vaikutuksen}})<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|33}} on civilians. [[6 inch siege gun M1877|{{convert|6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} 22 caliber siege gun model 1877]] was primarily an army weapon used on wheeled carriage on land front, but some guns mounted on fortification mounts were also used on sea front at the start of the war.<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|33,37}}\n\nLight coastal guns used at Krepost Sveaborg included [[QF 6 pounder Nordenfelt|57 mm Nordenfelt]] guns, fifteen guns at the beginning of the war and twenty by the end of the war. {{convert|75|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} [[75mm 50 caliber Pattern 1892|50 caliber model 1892]] Canet guns were similar to the six inch model 1892 gun.

Gun models included both older fixed carriage guns and more modern weapons with counter-recoil systems. The most common models were the 6&nbsp;inch siege gun model 1877 with a 190 [[pood]] version used on both field and fortress mounts and a lighter 120 pood barrel version on field carriage. 42 [[Line (length)|line]] ({{convert|107|mm|in|1|abbr=on|disp=or}}) battery gun model 1877 and [[87 mm light field gun M1877|34 line ({{convert|87|mm|in|1|abbr=on|disp=or}}) light field gun model 1877]] were other older field artillery pieces used at the fortress. [[76 mm divisional gun M1902|76 mm model 1902]] gun was a newer rapid fire field gun with a counter recoil system. The 76&nbsp;mm model 1902 gun was also used as an anti-aircraft gun on a modified \"Rosenberg\" mount. The land front weaponry also included a variety of smaller caliber anti-storming guns, caponier guns and other mixed artillery pieces. The reserve guns included different older models up to bronze-barrelled mortars.<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|34}}<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.novision.fi/viapori/aseet.htm | title = Krepost-Sveaborgin aseet | first1 = John | last1 = Lagerstedt | first2 = Markku | last2 = Saari | year = 2000 | work = Krepost Sveaborg | language = Finnish |trans-title=Weapons of Krepost-Sveaborg | accessdate = 2010-05-23}}</ref>\n\n{{Gallery\n| title = Field guns of Krepost Sveaborg\n|File:152mm m1877 190 pood gun 2.jpg|6 inch 190 pood barrel model 1877 siege gun\n|File:6-inch siege gun M1877 120 pood version 1.JPG|6 inch 120 pood barrel model 1877 siege gun\n|File:152 22 D Suomenlinna 2.JPG|6 inch model 1877 siege gun on fortress carriage\n|File:Model 1877 107mm gun 2.jpg|42 line model 1877 battery gun\n|File:Model 1877 87 mm Russian Field Gun 2.jpg|34 line model 1877 field gun\n|File:76 mm m1902 suomenlinna helsinki 1.jpg|76 mm model 1902 field gun\n}}\n\n===Mines===\n\n[[Naval mine]]s were also used to protect Krepost Sveaborg from an attack from the sea. An outer line of contact mines was laid approximately {{convert|15|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} outside the main line of defence. Shore detonated [[controlled mines]] were used to create an inner mine barrier to protect the entrances to the outer anchorage. These mines were laid typically in three rows with {{convert|200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} separation between rows and {{convert|60|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} between mines in a row. Controlled mines required an extensive cabling system to the shore stations where the command to detonate the mines was given. Fortified electrical stations provided the necessary electricity for the mine control network. Electricity was also used for communication systems, searchlights, electrical ammunition lifts and in barracks and crew shelters.<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|45\u201347}}<ref name=\"Suomenlinna_linnoitus_i_maailmansodassa\"/>\n\n==Equipment==\n\n===Rangefinders===\n\n[[Depression position finder|Vertical based rangefinders]], where the known base length is the height of the [[rangefinder]] from sea level, were first used at Viapori in the 1880s. Vertical based rangefinders required only one instrument, but they were susceptible to interference from vibration caused by firing of the guns. Vertical based rangefinders also required a substantially high measurement site that was a problem on the low islands. To measure distance with reasonable accuracy to a target {{convert|10|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} away the rangefinder had to be at least 10 [[fathom]]s ({{convert|21.3|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and preferably 20 fathoms ({{convert|42.6|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) high - often impossible to achieve. Measurement sites had usually the rangefinder on a stone or masonry column {{convert|110|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} high lying on a granite foundation. The measurement pavilions had simple wooden walls and sheet metal roof protecting them from the elements and were {{convert|4|-|6|m2|sqft|0|abbr=on}} in size. Vertical rangefinders were no longer used on the new forts built on the outer islands.<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|40}}\n\nDistance measurement at the {{convert|10|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} model 1891 batteries was based on horizontal [[triangulation]] from two different points, a primary and secondary, on separate islands. The rangefinders used were general von der Launitz's models 1903 and 1905-07. The average distance between the two points at Krepost Sveaborg was {{convert|5.5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. Target information was sent from the primary point to the battery command point. If the primary point was located away from the battery or directing a different battery a rangefinder converter designed by colonel Kovanko was used to calculate the firing solution. A weakness in using two measurement points was that any malfunctions in either of the rangefinders or in the telephone system would render the system inoperable. Target indication between the primary and secondary points could also pose problems, as there would often be several similar target ships. The system was also not capable of measuring distances to targets in the rear of the battery; a maximum measurement sector was 140\u00b0.<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|41\u201342}}\n\nOn the smaller {{convert|6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} model 1892 Canet gun and anti-aircraft batteries {{convert|3|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] [[Coincidence rangefinder|stereoscopic rangefinders]] were used. Maximum distance that could be reliably measured with three meter rangefinders was {{convert|8|-|10|km|mi|abbr=on}}, while the maximum range of the six inch guns was {{convert|13|-|14|km|mi|abbr=on}}. A single {{convert|6|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} rangefinder was used by the commander of the artillery in a central fire control station at Kuivasaari. Six meter rangefinders were also planned for the 10&nbsp;inch batteries later in the war but never obtained.<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|42\u201343}}\n\n===Searchlights===\n\nSearchlights were first used at Viapori during the Russo-Turkish War in 1878, and they were originally intended for guarding the controlled mine barriers. During the First World War fortified searchlight positions were part of the coastal forts. The main line of defence had larger two {{convert|200|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} searchlights at Rys\u00e4kari and Kuivasaari and an additional six smaller {{convert|150|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} searchlights beside them and on the other islands. Miessaari 150&nbsp;cm searchlight position was not completed during the war. In the second line 150&nbsp;cm searchlights were used on Kuninkaansaari and Vallisaari, while other forts had {{convert|110|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} or {{convert|90|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} searchlights. [[Diesel generator]]s provided the necessary electrical power to operate the searchlights. Searchlights were used in disappearing positions, where the searchlight was normally in a shelter and only exposed when needed for illumination. The disappearing positions had two types: either the searchlight was raised from the shelter by a lifting mechanism, or it was moved by rails from the shelter to position.<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|43\u201344}}\n\n===Communications===\n\nTelephone and telegraph system linked the various parts of the fortress. Krepost Sveaborg had both a regular telephone system and a second, independent telephone network dedicated for fire control. The primary telephone exchange was located on Iso Mustasaari. The various island forts had their own telephone exchanges, while Kuivasaari and Isosaari had central coastal telephone exchanges with links to other main line of defence forts. The telephone cabels on main line of defence were usually buried, while second line used overhead lines. Besides telephone [[optical telegraph]]s, [[signal lamp]]s and [[signal flag]]s were also used.<ref name=\"Manninen\" />{{rp|46}}\n\n==Land front==\n\nTo protect Krepost Sveaborg and the naval base in particular from a German attack from land the fortifications were built to protect the fortress. The first fortifications were hastily built in 1914 to block access to the Helsinki peninsula and to guard the eastern flank of [[Laajasalo]] and [[Santahamina]] by a scarce line of fortifications at [[Ruskeasuo]]-[[Pasila]]-[[K\u00e4pyl\u00e4]]-[[Koskela]]-[[Viikki]]-[[Herttoniemi]]-[[Roihuvuori]]. [[Lauttasaari]], [[Meilahti]] and Laajasalo were also fortified to some extent. It was also planned to fortify [[Kulosaari]] and [[Vartiosaari]]. These first fortifications were field fortifications located {{convert|6|-|7|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city center, with the defence concentrated at fortified hilltop [[redoubt]]s.<ref name=\"rky\"/><ref name=\"viapori/vyohyke\"/>\n\nIn early 1915 it was decided to build new defenses further away from the city center. The new defenses were stronger fixed fortifications with positions quarried into rock or dug into ground. Fortifications were built from wood and stone masonry as well as concrete. New fortifications had a network of defensive structures, with trenches, rifle pits, machine gun nests, [[Wire obstacle|barbed wire obstacles]], shelters and roads. Artillery batteries were located {{convert|0.5|-|1.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} behind the front line, often located on reverse slope. Artillery batteries had 2-6, typically four, guns. Heavily fortified caponiers providing flanking fire were built on places of the front line. First a northern line was built at [[Lepp\u00e4vaara]]-[[Kaarela]]-[[Pakila]]-[[Pukinm\u00e4ki]]-[[Myllypuro]]-[[Vartiokyl\u00e4]]. Construction on a western line from Lepp\u00e4vaara to [[Westend, Espoo|Westend]] via [[Tapiola]] began shortly afterwards. In late 1915 it was decided to build an outer line of defence on the northern and eastern sectors, extending the fortifications northward and in the east from Pukinm\u00e4ki to [[Malmi, Helsinki|Malmi]], [[Mellunkyl\u00e4]] and [[Vuosaari]]. Fortification works continued until the February revolution of 1917, and some work was done until early 1918. The land front was divided into three sectors, eastern, northern and western with 36 bases, numbered I-XXXVII. The bases were usually centered on hilltops with the strongest defences.<ref name=\"rky\"/><ref name=\"viapori/vyohyke\"/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.novision.fi/viapori/system.htm | title  = Linnoitusj\u00e4rjestelm\u00e4 | first1 = John | last1 = Lagerstedt | first2 = Markku | last2 = Saari | year = 2000 | work = Krepost Sveaborg | language = Finnish |trans-title=Fortification system | accessdate  = 2010-05-23}}</ref><ref name=\"vallihaudat/linnoitteet\">{{cite web | url = http://weegee.espoo.fi/museot/verkko/valli/vamuo.htm | title = Mist\u00e4 linnoitteet muodostuivat? | work = Kuka kaivoi vallihaudat | publisher = Espoon kaupunginmuseo | language = Finnish | trans-title = What structures formed the fortifications? | accessdate = 2010-05-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110720181513/http://weegee.espoo.fi/museot/verkko/valli/vamuo.htm | archive-date = 2011-07-20 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nThe basic front line fortifications were open or covered machine gun nests, rifle pits, observation posts and shelters. Most of the structures were designed to be covered with a concrete roof poured on wooden planks occasionally reinforced with railway tracks. Some of the positions were built with stone or logs.

During the war new fortifications were built on the outlying islands pushing the defences outward to protect the ships in the harbour from new modern guns. During the First World War the naval front of the fortress was modernized almost completely. The new gun batteries can be divided into four types: heavy long range batteries, close range batteries, anti-landing batteries equipped with field guns and anti-aircraft batteries which appeared during the war for the first time. The naval front was divided into six sectors at the start of the war with sectors 1-4 comprising the old fortress, sector 5 Isosaari and sector 6 Melkki. The central fire control post was located in Vallisaari. As the new coastal forts were completed the organization changed and the naval front was divided into two parts: an outer main line of defence from Melkki to Isosaari and an inner second line of defence from Lauttasaari to Santahamina. The naval front command post was located in Vallisaari and the main artillery command post in Kuivasaari.<ref name=\"Manninen\"/>{{rp|23\u201324}}\n\nThe long range batteries of {{convert|10|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} guns included ten batteries with six 10&nbsp;inch batteries and four 6&nbsp;inch batteries, with one more under construction. The basic shape of the batteries is four guns in a row protected from the front by a concrete parapet of approximately {{convert|5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} thick with traversal walls between the gun positions. The batteries had no rear protection. Shelter for crew and ammunition cellars were built into and under the front parapet and the traversal walls. While the basic plan is similar, each battery is unique depending on the terrain. For the 10&nbsp;inch guns the average distance between guns is {{convert|40|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, but on smaller island such as Katajaluoto the guns are only {{convert|30|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} apart while the larger Isosaari battery (No 1) has guns {{convert|50|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} apart. Similarly the 6&nbsp;inch batteries have guns {{convert|35|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} apart on average, but in the very cramped Harmaja battery the distance between guns is only {{convert|20|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and the battery is not built on straight line but in a crooked L-shape. Many batteries have an [[icon]] closet framed with granite.<ref name=\"Manninen\"/>{{rp|27\u201328}}\n\n===Main line of defence===\n\nThe main line of defence was the outer seaward defence of Krepost Sveaborg. The main line of defence had the newest fortifications and the heaviest and most modern armament. At the end of the war, it comprised (from west to east): Miessaari and Py\u00f6r\u00e4saari, Rys\u00e4kari, katajaluoto, Harmaja, Kuivasaari, Isosaari, Santahamina and It\u00e4-Villinki islands and Skatanniemi cape.<ref name=\"Manninen\"/>{{rp|51}} The living conditions on the small, exposed islands were often poor, and the food supply was arranged from the older parts of the fortification with a week's supply of canned food, sugar and other compact food products stored on the islands. Construction of bakeries on the outer forts began after the February revolution as a result of the demand of an artillery regiment committee formed by the soldiers.<ref name=\"Manninen\"/>{{rp|48}}\n\n====Miessaari and Py\u00f6r\u00e4saari====\n\n[[Miessaari]] {{coord|60|7|55.88|N|24|46|50.49|E|region:FI_type:isle|display=inline}} and the small [[Py\u00f6r\u00e4saari]] {{coord|60|7|40.18|N|24|46|11.56|E|region:FI_type:isle|display=inline}} formed the western reach of the naval front main line of defence. They are located near the coast of [[Espoo]], and protected the coastal routes on the western flank of the fortress. Miessaari naval front battery number 40 had four {{convert|6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} Canet guns, while Py\u00f6r\u00e4saari had two two-gun batteries of light 57&nbsp;mm guns. Py\u00f6r\u00e4saari was connected to Miessaari by a bridge in 1917. The construction of the Canet gun battery began in spring 1915, the guns were installed in May 1916 and the construction was mostly finished by early 1917, though some work on the interior shelters continued until summer 1917. Py\u00f6r\u00e4saari 57&nbsp;mm gun positions were quarried in late autumn 1915 and completed in June 1916. The islands also formed the seam between naval and land fronts, and Miessaari had also a land-facing battery number 115 of six {{convert|6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} 190 pood model 1877 siege guns, supporting the base XXXIV in [[Haukilahti]]-[[Westend, Espoo|Westend]] area.<ref name=\"Manninen\"/>{{rp|51\u201354}}<ref>{{cite web | url = http://weegee.espoo.fi/museot/verkko/valli/vamer.htm | title = Merilinnoitteet Espoossa | work = Kuka kaivoi vallihaudat | publisher = Espoon kaupunginmuseo | language = Finnish | trans-title = Coastal fortifications in Espoo | accessdate = 2010-05-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721050041/http://weegee.espoo.fi/museot/verkko/valli/vamer.htm | archive-date = 2011-07-21 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n====Rys\u00e4kari====\n\n[[Rys\u00e4kari]] island {{coord|60|6|3.95|N|24|49|55.27|E|region:FI_type:isle|display=inline}} had the westernmost 10-inch battery, and could command the western sea routes up to south-western shores of [[Porkkala]]nniemi peninsula. Construction of the battery located in the middle of the island began shortly after the war broke up, in October 1914. The guns, transported from Vladivostok, were installed by January 1915 and the entire battery with ammunition cellars and concrete command tower was finished in spring 1916.

A 10-inch battery built on the widest part divides the island into northern and southern parts. The construction of the battery began in October 1914 and the guns were placed on their foundations in early 1915 with the parapet and traversal walls completed in autumn 1915. Katajaluoto battery is the narrowest of the 10-inch batteries. The northern shore of the island has a heavily fortified concrete bunker used as mine control bunker, telephone exchange and electrical station. The island had a 150&nbsp;cm searchlight.

The small island did not have the necessary building materials, and sand, gravel and cement had to be brought in with barges. The guns were installed in February 1915 and the battery was finished in September 1916.

After the war began construction of a 10-inch battery began on the western shore of the island. The guns, transported from Vladivostok, were placed on their foundations in February 1915 and the battery was finished in early winter of 1915. The main fire control station of the fortress with the only {{convert|6|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} rangefinder was located in Kuivasaari. The island also had a 150&nbsp;cm searchlight. Kuivasaari telephone exchange was also the central gunnery telephone exchange. A four-gun 75&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft battery on wooden platforms was located on the northern part of the island.<ref name=\"Manninen\"/>{{rp|62\u201365}}\n\n====Isosaari====\n\n[[Isosaari]] {{coord|60|6|7.19|N|25|3|8.76|E|region:FI_type:isle|display=inline}} is the largest of the outlying islands. The island's central location and size made it the most heavily armed coastal fort and it was part of the plans for expanding Krepost Sveaborg already in 1909. In May 1914 construction of four concrete fortified batteries began: one 10&nbsp;inch battery, one 11&nbsp;inch battery and two 6&nbsp;inch batteries. The start of the war hastened the consctruction works that had progressed slowly, and three 10&nbsp;inch guns were placed on temporary wooden platforms. The concrete batteries were finished by autumn 1915, but a change in plans resulted in the second 6-inch battery being located in Santahamina instead. In January 1916 work began to modify the 11-inch battery (battery number 2) for 10-inch guns, with the modifications complete in 1916. The first 10-inch battery is located on the south-western tip of the island, while the other two batteries are on the south-eastern shore. A 150&nbsp;cm searchlight was located near the first 10-inch battery and a 200&nbsp;cm searchlight near the two other batteries. A narrow gauge [[Trench railways|military railway]] was built on the island to transport supplies and ammunition.<ref name=\"Manninen\"/>{{rp|65\u201371}}\n\n====Santahamina====\n\n[[Santahamina]] {{coord|60|8|44.18|N|25|3|1.96|E|region:FI_type:isle|display=inline}} was the largest single island in Krepost Sveaborg, and is located south of [[Laajasalo]]. Because of the size of the island Santahamina could be considered to belong to both main line of defence and the second line of defence. Santahamina was fortified during the Crimean War, and several gun batteries were built on the island during the decades between Crimean War and First World War. Most of the older guns, including eleven 6&nbsp;inch 190 pood siege guns and thirteen 9&nbsp;inch coastal mortars, were transported to the land front of the fortress shortly after the start of war. The remaining batteries were a 6-inch Canet battery, originally intended for Isosaari, at It\u00e4niemi on the south-eastern part of the island and a 75&nbsp;mm battery on the eastern shore. These batteries covered the sea east of Isosaari. Santahamina had a large garrison area and a substantial number of troops and supplies were located on the island.<ref name=\"Manninen\"/>{{rp|71\u201377}}\n\n====It\u00e4-Villinki====\n\n[[It\u00e4-Villinki]] {{coord|60|9|28.63|N|25|8|15.9|E|region:FI_type:isle|display=inline}} is located just east of the larger [[Villinki]] island. The island was a summer house district and the land had to be expropriated from the owners. Resistance by the land owners delayed the process, and was still not fully complete by late 1916. Fortification works for an 11-inch battery began in April 1915, but the battery was changed to 10&nbsp;inch guns in autumn of the same year. 10&nbsp;inch battery is built on a rock hilltop at the centre of the island. In July 1915 construction of a smaller battery for 75&nbsp;mm guns (originally planned for 57&nbsp;mm guns) on the eastern tip of the island began.<ref name=\"Manninen\"/>{{rp|77\u201380}}\n\n====Skatanniemi====\n\nSkatanniemi peninsula {{coord|60|11|34.81|N|25|10|40.46|E|region:FI|display=inline}} in [[Uutela]] is the only place of the main line of defence on the mainland. Construction of a 6-inch Canet battery began in late 1916. The battery fortifications, the parapet and traversal walls, were finished but the command points and most other auxiliary structures were not. The guns had arrived at the battery but were never installed and were reported stored nearby on the shore and pier in 1918.<ref>[[#Manninen 2000|Manninen 2000]], pp. 81\u201381.</ref>\n\n===Second line of defence===\n\nThe second line of defence included the older parts of the fortress and contained most of the storage and supply areas and other rear line functions. The fighting power of the second line was limited to quick-firing 75&nbsp;mm and 57&nbsp;mm guns and old 11&nbsp;inch cannons and mortars. The primary combat objective of the batteries on the second line was to prevent enemy ships from passing through Kustaanmiekansalmi or S\u00e4rk\u00e4nsalmi straits to the inner anchorage on Kruunuvuorenselk\u00e4. The second line included Lauttasaari, Melkki, Pihlajasaaret, Harakka, the central citadel at Suomenlinna, Lonna, Vallisaari, Kuninkaansaari, Nuottasaari and Vasikkasaari.<ref name=\"Manninen\"/>{{rp|23\u201324,32\u201333,48}}\n\n====Lauttasaari====\n\n[[Lauttasaari]] was fortified during the Crimean War, but had been disarmed in 1895. During the First World War the only battery was a land front battery number 116 at Vaskiniemi, armed with four {{convert|9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} model 1867 guns in March 1915. This battery supported base XXXVII located in southern Espoo at [[Tapiola]]\u2014[[Otaniemi]] area. The only naval front connection Lauttasaari had was an unfinished searchlight station in L\u00e4nsiulapanniemi and bakery constructed between 1916 and 1917 near the land front battery that was also used to supply the coastal forts on the nearby islands.<ref name=\"Manninen\"/>{{rp|83\u201385}} Lauttasaari was officially delegated to land front already in spring 1915.<ref name=\"Manninen\"/>{{rp|23\u201324}}\n\n====Melkki====\n\n[[Melkki]] {{coord|60|7|54.65|N|24|53|17.97|E|region:FI_type:isle|display=inline}} is located south of Lauttasaari. Construction of a 6-inch Canet battery and 11&nbsp;inch model 1877 battery began in May 1914, but the work was halted after the war began. The Canet battery was relocated to Harmaja, and the 11&nbsp;inch guns were used only for a short period on temporary wooden platforms. A 75&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft battery was located on the island in October 1914. In summer 1916 the guns were removed and the island was turned over for use as part of the naval base harbour facilities with machine shops and a naval mine depot.<ref name=\"Manninen\"/>{{rp|85\u201388}}\n\n====Pihlajasaaret====\n\n[[Pihlajasaari|Pihlajasaaret]] is a group of islands south of [[J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari]]. In summer 1916 the 75&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft battery on Melkki was relocated to It\u00e4inen Pihlajasaari {{coord|60|8|23.03|N|24|55|20.02|E|region:FI_type:isle|display=inline}}. The guns were on temporary wooden platforms, and the battery was relocated already in August as construction of new fortified concrete anti-aircraft positions and shelters began.

In the years before First World War the island had three batteries with five {{convert|9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} model 1867 guns, four 6&nbsp;inch 190 pood guns and two 57&nbsp;mm quick-firing guns. As the war began the 6&nbsp;inch guns were relocated to the land front while the 9&nbsp;inch guns were decommissioned and left in their positions. The two 57&nbsp;mm guns and two more guns from Vallisaari were relocated to a new field fortified battery on the southern tip of the island. Additionally the island had 2-4 antiaircraft guns of 75&nbsp;mm or {{convert|3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} during the war. The island had also a 110&nbsp;cm searchlight.<ref name=\"Manninen\"/>{{rp|90\u201391}}\n\n[[File:Suomenlinna aerial.JPG|thumb|Suomenlinna]]\n\n====The central citadel====\n\nThe central citadel of Krepost Sveaborg was formed on the old Swedish fortress of Sveaborg, modern [[Suomenlinna]] {{coord|60|08|37|N|24|59|04|E|region:FI_type:isle|display=inline}}. It included the islands of Kustaanmiekka, Susisaari, Iso Mustasaari, Pikku Mustasaari, L\u00e4nsi-Mustasaari, S\u00e4rkk\u00e4 and the [[skerry]] of Pormestarinluoto. Except for the smaller S\u00e4rkk\u00e4 and Pormestarinluoto the islands were connected by bridges or joined together. The islands housed the fortress commander and headquarters along with the main telephone exchange and the largest dry dock in Finland at the time. The citadel also had weapons and ammunition depots and other storage areas. Most of the fortification works were concentrated on other islands, and of the older armament only one battery of three 11&nbsp;inch guns remained in active service in Kustaanmiekka island. To guard Kustaanmiekansalmi strait two batteries of 57&nbsp;mm guns were built, one on Kustaanmiekka and one on Iso-Mustasaari island. A third battery of 57&nbsp;mm guns on L\u00e4nsi-Mustasaari guarded S\u00e4rk\u00e4nsalmi strait.<ref name=\"Manninen\"/>{{rp|92\u201396}}\n\n====Lonna====\n\n[[Lonna]] {{coord|60|9|16.17|N|24|59|23.2|E|region:FI_type:isle|display=inline}} is a small island north of Iso Mustasaari that was used as the main naval mine depot of Krepost Sveaborg. The island had three masonry and one wooden mine storage magazines and workshops, living quarters and equipment storage for mine company ships. At the end of the war the magazines had nearly 500 mines stored with another 650 mines in the open.<ref name=\"Manninen\"/>{{rp|96}}\n\n====Vallisaari, Kuninkaansaari and Nuottasaari====\n\n[[Vallisaari]] {{coord|60|8|8.96|N|25|0|6.45|E|region:FI_type:isle|display=inline}} and [[Kuninkaansaari]] {{coord|60|8|4.95|N|25|1|5.78|E|region:FI_type:isle|display=inline}} are located between Suomenlinna and Santahamina. The two islands were joined by a [[causeway]] across Kukisalmi strait at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. From the late 19th century until the First World War Vallisaari was the most heavily fortified island of the fortress. Construction of a 6-inch Canet battery on the island began in 1912, but the guns were relocated to the outer islands on the new main line of defence at the beginning of the war. Of the older guns a five-gun battery of 11&nbsp;inch model 1877 guns and six-gun battery of 11&nbsp;inch mortars were still used during the war. Two of the mortars were transported to the land front in early 1915, and the rest were decommissioned and abandoned on their positions in 1916. A six-gun battery of 6&nbsp;inch model 1877 siege guns on fortress carriages were transported to the land front by the end of 1914. Newer artillery included two 57&nbsp;mm guns that were replaced with four 75&nbsp;mm guns in October 1914. Of the Kuninkaansaari batteries one four-gun battery of 11&nbsp;inch model 1877 guns was kept in service. Two of the five 11&nbsp;inch mortars were also in use until 1915. The rest of the guns - five 9&nbsp;inch model 1867 guns, four 6&nbsp;inch model 1877 siege guns, two (possibly four) 9&nbsp;inch mortars and three 11&nbsp;inch mortars were moved to the land front shortly after the start of the war. Both Vallisaari and Kuninkaansaari had a 150&nbsp;cm searchlight stations. Small [[Nuottasaari, Helsinki|Nuottasaari]] island {{coord|60|8|28.34|N|25|1|34.21|E|region:FI_type:isle|display=inline}} north of Haminasalmi strait between Kuninkaansaari and Santahamina was armed with four 8&nbsp;inch model 1867 guns in 1887, but the island had been disarmed by 1914.<ref name=\"Manninen\"/>{{rp|97\u2013109}}\n\n====Vasikkasaari====\n\n[[Vasikkasaari]] {{coord|60|9|10.48|N|25|0|46.93|E|region:FI_type:isle|display=inline}} was used as a fuel and ammunition depot of Krepost Sveaborg. The island is located in Kruunuvuorenselk\u00e4 where the inner anchorage of the fortress was, between Suomenlinna, Santahamina and Laajasalo. Three large fuel oil tanks served the naval base and two smaller diesel tanks provided fuel for the mine company (later battalion) ships of the fortress. A pumping station powered by steam engine was connected to the tanks. Eight storage magazines housed weapons, ammunition, mines and torpedoes with a narrow gauge railway built on the island connecting them to the main pier. At the start of the war a 57&nbsp;mm quick fire battery was located on the island, replaced by a 75&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft battery in spring 1915. The anti-aircraft battery was relocated in summer 1916. A 90&nbsp;cm searchlight was also located on the island.<ref name=\"Manninen\"/>{{rp|109\u2013117}}\n\n==Finnish Civil War==\n\nKrepost Sveaborg never did see action against Germany in Russian hands. After the Russian revolution the [[treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] ended Russia's participation in the First World War. The treaty affirmed the independence of Finland and required Russian troops to leave from the country. Of the approximately 35 000 Russian soldiers and sailors who were around Helsinki in January 1918 most were demobilized and sent home or simply left by 15 March. Around one thousand joined the Finnish [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red Guards]] in the Finnish Civil War. The Soviet leadership ordered Krepost Sveaborg headquarters to begin preparations to abandon the fortress and destroy what could not be evacuated in case it would fall into German hands. Some field guns were transported to Russia, but all the coastal guns were left. On 3 April 1918 German [[Baltic Sea Division]] landed in [[Hanko]], after being requested by the White [[Senate of Finland|Senate of Vaasa]] to participate in the Finnish Civil War against the Reds. Russian Baltic fleet officers had made an agreement with the Germans allowing a safe departure for the warships and disarming the fortress. Most of the Russian ships left by mid-April, but the last ships left only in May\u2013June 1918. The disarmament - removing locks from the guns, cutting the cables controlling the mines and destroying the mine control stations - had to be done in secret as an agreement between Soviet government and Finnish Red Guards had promised the latter all the fortifications. When the Germans arrived in Helsinki the Red Guard could only use some of the land front fortifications in Lepp\u00e4vaara and Ruskeasuo, and the Germans with a well equipped and trained numerically superior force quickly captured Helsinki between 11th and 13 April. The Russian guards ceded the coastal forts to Germans according to their agreement. The disarmament of Krepost Sveaborg, denying the Reds from using it, was used in White [[propaganda]] by how [[Allan Staffans]] had duped the Russians and removed the locks without authorization; but actually the disarmament occurred with the order of the fortress commander and with the knowledge of naval headquarters.<ref>{{cite news |last=Salonen |first=Juha |title=Riisuttiinko Viapori aseista huijauksella vai merilinnakkeen johdon tietoisella tuella? |url=http://www.hs.fi/paivanlehti/arkisto/Riisuttiinko+Viapori+aseista+huijauksella+vai+merilinnakkeen+johdon+tietoisella+tuella/aaHS20080322SI2KA0286n?src=haku&ref=arkisto%2F |accessdate=2014-03-30 |date=2008-03-22 |newspaper=[[Helsingin Sanomat]] |publisher=Sanoma News Oy |language=Finnish |trans-title=Was Viapori disarmed with a ploy or with knowledge and support of the sea fortress command?}}</ref> On 12 May Krepost Sveaborg was renamed ''Suomenlinna'' to celebrate the new independency.<ref name=\"Manninen\"/>{{rp|20\u201321}}<ref name=\"rky\"/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://weegee.espoo.fi/museot/verkko/valli/vakay.htm | title = Linnoituslaitteet k\u00e4yt\u00f6ss\u00e4 - ensimm\u00e4isen ja ainoan kerran | work = Kuka kaivoi vallihaudat | publisher = Espoon kaupunginmuseo | language = Finnish | trans-title = Fortification in action - for the first and last time | accessdate = 2010-05-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721050117/http://weegee.espoo.fi/museot/verkko/valli/vakay.htm | archive-date = 2011-07-21 | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.novision.fi/viapori/sotilaat.htm | title = Sotilaat ja taistelut | first1 = John | last1 = Lagerstedt | first2 = Markku | last2 = Saari | year = 2000 | work = Krepost Sveaborg | language = Finnish |trans-title=Soldiers and battles | accessdate = 2010-05-23}}</ref>\n\n==Later history==\n\nAfter First World War the fortifications of Krepost Sveaborg were taken over by Finland. Most of the land front fortifications were disarmed, stripped of useful equipment and abandoned. Much of the land front fortifications with steel reinforcements were destroyed in the inter war period and the steel sold as scrap. During the [[Second World War]] an inventory of the land front fortifications was conducted regarding their usefulness, with the larger shelters quarried into the rock under particular interest as facilities for war industry, emergency hospitals or storage. Some of the land front shelters are still used as storage space. As settlement spread during the urbanization after the Second World War many of the fortifications were destroyed as new suburbs were constructed. The coastal fortifications were used by the Finnish coastal artillery to protect Helsinki. Most of the islands remained in military use and were thus spared from vandalism. All structures of the Krepost Sveaborg fortifications around Helsinki, both land and sea fronts, were declared protected historical sites by the [[Finnish National Board of Antiquities]] in 1971.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://weegee.espoo.fi/museot/verkko/valli/va80.htm | title = Linnoituksen asema 80 vuotta my\u00f6hemmin | work = Kuka kaivoi vallihaudat | publisher = Espoon kaupunginmuseo | language = Finnish | trans-title = Fortification 80 years later | accessdate = 2010-05-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721050127/http://weegee.espoo.fi/museot/verkko/valli/va80.htm | archive-date = 2011-07-21 | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref name=\"viapori/nyky\u00e4\u00e4n\">{{cite web | url = http://www.novision.fi/viapori/nyky.htm | title = Helsingin maa- ja merilinnoitus nyky\u00e4\u00e4n | first1 = John\n| last1 = Lagerstedt | first2 = Markku | last2 = Saari | year = 2000 | work = Krepost Sveaborg | language = Finnish |trans-title=Helsinki land and sea fortress today | accessdate = 2010-05-23}}</ref>\n\n===Present day condition===\n\nWhile much of land front fortifications have been destroyed, many areas have been more or less preserved and some sections have been partly restored. In Vantaa L\u00e4nsiniemi and Rajakyl\u00e4 areas have been cleared from rubbish and vegetation. In Espoo Laajalahti, M\u00e4kkyl\u00e4, Ormberget and Ruukinranta areas have also been cleared. In Helsinki trees threatening the structure of one of the older 1914 redoubts in Rajakallio have been cut, and the city planning department has made a plan regarding the maintenance of the cleared areas and restoring new ones. Of the coastal forts, all main line of defence islands except Py\u00f6r\u00e4saari and Harmaja are still in military use and forbidden from civilians, and Harmaja is used by the Finnish Maritime Administration as a pilot station. A coastal artillery museum has been built on Kuivasaari and the island is no longer in active military use, but still officially restricted area. Visitors are allowed but only in organized tours. It is planned to transfer Kuivasaari, together with Rys\u00e4kari, into civilian authorities. Skatanniemi cape is the only area of the main line of defence that is easily visited. The central citadel of Suomenlinna is a major tourist attraction and [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] with regular ferry connection. The islands of Vallisaari and Kuninkaansaari are also currently being transferred to civilian authorities, with military tentatively scheduled to leave the islands by 2012. Pihlajasaaret is a Helsinki city recreation area open to public with regular ferry connection during summertime.

It is based on the [[Bad Ronald (novel)|novel of the same title]] by [[Jack Vance]]. \n\nAfter being out of print for years following its initial [[VHS]] release in the 1980s, the film was reissued on [[DVD]] in August 2009, as part of the manufacture-on-demand [[Warner Archive Collection]].  The title was also released on blu-ray on October 9th, 2018.\n\n==Plot==\nRonald Wilby ([[Scott Jacoby (actor)|Scott Jacoby]]) is a socially inept, awkward high school youth with budding artistic talent and a predilection for fantasy, who is often ridiculed for his behavior and mannerisms. His overprotective mother, Elaine ([[Kim Hunter]]), needs surgery and plans for Ronald to become a doctor and cure her illness. Ronald's father has not been heard from in years, having divorced his mother and agreeing to terminate his parental rights in exchange for not having to pay child support.\n\nOne afternoon, while asking out Laurie Matthews (Shelley Spurlock), Ronald is rejected and then ridiculed by her friends. As he returns home, he accidentally knocks over her younger sister Carol (Angela Hoffman). Carol, like Laurie, taunts Ronald. He pushes her over, inadvertently killing her when she strikes her head on a concrete block. He buries the body and confesses to his mother. Fearing the police will not believe that it was accidental, Ronald and his mother wallpaper the door frame to the downstairs bathroom and convert the closed-off space to a living quarters for Ronald, with a concealed trapdoor in the pantry through which Ronald can escape in an emergency. The plan is for him to hide in the room until the incident blows over. Mrs. Wilby tells the police that Ronald ran away.\n\nRonald's mother pays attention to what neighbors, particularly the nosy Mrs. Schumacher ([[Linda Watkins]]), and others are saying about the girl's disappearance and tells Ronald that when it's safe, he can return to a normal life. One afternoon, she is taken into a hospital for gallbladder surgery, from which she unexpectedly dies. In the meantime, Ronald has created a fantasy world in his head consisting of a prince and a princess that live happily until an evil duke appears and a struggle begins.\n\nShortly after Mrs. Wilby's death, the house is sold to the Wood family, consisting of a mother ([[Pippa Scott]]), father ([[Dabney Coleman]]) and three teenage daughters: Babs ([[Cindy Fisher (actress)|Cindy Fisher]]), Althea (Cindy Eilbacher) and Ellen ([[Lisa Eilbacher]]). \nAs Ronald needs food and begins to crave human interaction, disappearances of food and odd noises are experienced by the new family. \n\nBabs, the youngest of the Wood daughters, becomes identified with Ronald's princess and he identifies himself as the prince. Duane Matthews ([[Ted Eccles]]) (who is well liked by the family), oldest daughter Ellen's boyfriend and brother of the Matthews girls, becomes identified with the evil duke that threatens their happiness. Ronald's goal is to \"regain\" his princess and remove anything, including the members of her family, that stops his dream from becoming reality. During this time, neighbor Mrs. Schumacher sees Ronald and dies of a heart attack from the shock; fearing the police will blame him, Ronald buries her too.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Wood make plans to go out of town for a couple of days, leaving the girls on their own. Ronald confronts Babs when she is alone in the house and tells her she is his princess. She flees to Mrs. Schumacher's house next door (unaware of her demise), but Ronald locks her in the basement and forges a note for her sisters to find, claiming she has run away. Both Ellen and Althea are skeptical of the note, but the police refuse to do anything. Ronald later attacks Duane when he is alone in the house. He knocks him out, binds and gags him, and hides him in his hidden living space. The police now suspect something is wrong and advise Ellen and Althea to check into a hotel; they refuse. \n\nShortly after the police leave, the girls hear noises downstairs as Duane tries to free himself and fights with Ronald. Althea notices one of the many peepholes Ronald has drilled. When she approaches it, she sees Ronald's eye staring back at her and screams in terror as Ronald breaks through the wall. The police, who have been watching the house, hear the screams and rush back. Ronald is captured as he tries to flee, crying out for his mother. Babs is found after escaping from Mrs. Schumacher's basement, and Duane is found in the living space, both shaken but not seriously harmed.\n\n==Reception==\nIn his book ''What Were They Thinking?

The title was also released on blu-ray on October 9th, 2018.\n\n==Plot==\nRonald Wilby ([[Scott Jacoby (actor)|Scott Jacoby]]) is a socially inept, awkward high school youth with budding artistic talent and a predilection for fantasy, who is often ridiculed for his behavior and mannerisms. His overprotective mother, Elaine ([[Kim Hunter]]), needs surgery and plans for Ronald to become a doctor and cure her illness. Ronald's father has not been heard from in years, having divorced his mother and agreeing to terminate his parental rights in exchange for not having to pay child support.\n\nOne afternoon, while asking out Laurie Matthews (Shelley Spurlock), Ronald is rejected and then ridiculed by her friends. As he returns home, he accidentally knocks over her younger sister Carol (Angela Hoffman). Carol, like Laurie, taunts Ronald. He pushes her over, inadvertently killing her when she strikes her head on a concrete block. He buries the body and confesses to his mother. Fearing the police will not believe that it was accidental, Ronald and his mother wallpaper the door frame to the downstairs bathroom and convert the closed-off space to a living quarters for Ronald, with a concealed trapdoor in the pantry through which Ronald can escape in an emergency. The plan is for him to hide in the room until the incident blows over. Mrs. Wilby tells the police that Ronald ran away.\n\nRonald's mother pays attention to what neighbors, particularly the nosy Mrs. Schumacher ([[Linda Watkins]]), and others are saying about the girl's disappearance and tells Ronald that when it's safe, he can return to a normal life. One afternoon, she is taken into a hospital for gallbladder surgery, from which she unexpectedly dies. In the meantime, Ronald has created a fantasy world in his head consisting of a prince and a princess that live happily until an evil duke appears and a struggle begins.\n\nShortly after Mrs. Wilby's death, the house is sold to the Wood family, consisting of a mother ([[Pippa Scott]]), father ([[Dabney Coleman]]) and three teenage daughters: Babs ([[Cindy Fisher (actress)|Cindy Fisher]]), Althea (Cindy Eilbacher) and Ellen ([[Lisa Eilbacher]]). \nAs Ronald needs food and begins to crave human interaction, disappearances of food and odd noises are experienced by the new family. \n\nBabs, the youngest of the Wood daughters, becomes identified with Ronald's princess and he identifies himself as the prince. Duane Matthews ([[Ted Eccles]]) (who is well liked by the family), oldest daughter Ellen's boyfriend and brother of the Matthews girls, becomes identified with the evil duke that threatens their happiness. Ronald's goal is to \"regain\" his princess and remove anything, including the members of her family, that stops his dream from becoming reality. During this time, neighbor Mrs. Schumacher sees Ronald and dies of a heart attack from the shock; fearing the police will blame him, Ronald buries her too.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Wood make plans to go out of town for a couple of days, leaving the girls on their own. Ronald confronts Babs when she is alone in the house and tells her she is his princess. She flees to Mrs. Schumacher's house next door (unaware of her demise), but Ronald locks her in the basement and forges a note for her sisters to find, claiming she has run away. Both Ellen and Althea are skeptical of the note, but the police refuse to do anything. Ronald later attacks Duane when he is alone in the house. He knocks him out, binds and gags him, and hides him in his hidden living space. The police now suspect something is wrong and advise Ellen and Althea to check into a hotel; they refuse. \n\nShortly after the police leave, the girls hear noises downstairs as Duane tries to free himself and fights with Ronald. Althea notices one of the many peepholes Ronald has drilled. When she approaches it, she sees Ronald's eye staring back at her and screams in terror as Ronald breaks through the wall. The police, who have been watching the house, hear the screams and rush back. Ronald is captured as he tries to flee, crying out for his mother. Babs is found after escaping from Mrs. Schumacher's basement, and Duane is found in the living space, both shaken but not seriously harmed.\n\n==Reception==\nIn his book ''What Were They Thinking?

Although their weekly radio series ended in 1997 and  their television series ended in 2008, the troupe remained active  until 2019, with annual [[New Year's Eve]] specials on [[CBC Television]]. CBC announced that, due to budgetary constraints, the special scheduled to air on December 30, 2019 would be the final in the series.<ref name=finale>{{cite news |last1=Brioux |first1=Bill |title=CBC cancels Air Farce New Year's Eve special, troupe gets one last hurrah on Dec. 30 |url=https://www.timescolonist.com/cbc-cancels-air-farce-new-year-s-eve-special-troupe-gets-one-last-hurrah-on-dec-30-1.23967222 |accessdate=October 5, 2019 |work=(Victoria) Times-Colonist |agency=Canadian Press |date=October 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Theatre revue and radio years ===\nThe group started in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] in 1970 as an improvisational theatre revue called ''The Jest Society'', a pun on then-[[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s famous goal of making Canada a [[Just society#Canadian usage|\"just society\"]]. The original cast was [[John Morgan (comedian)|John Morgan]], [[Martin Bronstein]], [[Patrick Conlon (journalist)|Patrick Conlon]], [[Gay Claitman]], and [[Roger Abbott]]. The troupe moved to Toronto where it had a long-term residency at the [[Poor Alex Theatre]].  Steve Whistance-Smith was briefly a member, replacing Patrick Conlon who declined to continue commuting to Toronto from Montreal, and then [[Don Ferguson (actor)|Don Ferguson]] joined when Whistance-Smith left.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbc.ca/programguide/personality/don_ferguson |title=Don Ferguson |work=CBC Program Guide |accessdate=December 29, 2019}}</ref> The show was favourably reviewed by local theatre critics, attracting the attention of [[CBC Radio]], which commissioned the troupe to perform sketches on its weekly variety show, ''[[The Entertainers (radio program)|The Entertainers]]''; the sketches were taped at a CBC studio without a live audience.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://torontoguardian.com/2017/06/air-farce-canada-150-ferguson/ |title=Don Ferguson, Air Farce and 150 Years of Funny |date=June 30, 2017 |first=Dean |last=Young |publisher=Toronto Guardian|accessdate=December 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter a number of personnel changes, the group became the \"Royal Canadian Air Farce\" in 1973 when the troupe was given its own show, taped in front of a live audience at the Curtain Club in [[Richmond Hill, Ontario]]. The CBC gives the date of the first broadcast as December 9, 1973.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://airfarce.com/about#intro |title=About: Intro |website=airfarce.com|access-date=April 28, 2019 }}</ref> By this time the lineup consisted of Roger Abbott, [[Luba Goy]], John Morgan, [[Dave Broadfoot]], and Martin Bronstein. At this point  Don Ferguson was a writer on the show. They quickly became one of the network's most popular programs. Most of their later shows were based in Toronto and recorded in CBC's [[Cabbagetown (Toronto)|Cabbagetown]] Studios; however as the troupe became more popular, they frequently travelled throughout the country to record their weekly radio broadcasts, which featured a mixture of political and cultural satire heavily influenced by the style of [[Wayne and Shuster]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Desiring Canada: CBC Contests, Hockey Violence and Other Stately Pleasures|page=176|author=Patricia Cormack and James Cosgrave|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1442663305}}</ref> The touring show also often included one or more sketches satirizing local culture or politics, which were not aired on the national radio broadcast.\n\nBronstein ceased performing with the troupe in 1974 to pursue a full-time journalism career, but continued to write for the Air Farce until the late 1970s. Ferguson, who had been a writer on the show's first season, swapped placed with Bronstein, becoming a writer-performer.<ref>[http://www.squashtalk.com/html/news/bronsteinbio.htm Martin Bronstein's Bio 1999-2003 copyright SquashTalk.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121184359/http://www.squashtalk.com/html/news/bronsteinbio.htm |date=2008-11-21 }}</ref> In 1977, non-performing writers [[Gord Holtam]] and [[Rick Olsen]] joined the crew. In the late 1970s during a trip to [[Los Angeles]], Abbott and Ferguson were offered jobs writing for the new television sitcom ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]'', but opted to remain with ''Air Farce'' instead.<ref>\"Remembering Roger Abbott\". ''[[Q (radio show)|Q]]'', March 28, 2011.</ref>\n\n[[Recurring character]]s included addle-brained hockey player Big Bobby Clobber (Broadfoot), [[Sgt. Renfrew#Parody|Sgt. Renfrew]] of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (Broadfoot), and socialite Amy De La Pompa (Morgan), along with political figures such as [[Brian Mulroney]], [[Joe Clark]], and [[Pierre Trudeau]]. Additional characters included Prof. Hieronymus Wombat of the [[National Research Council of Canada|National Research Council]] and funeral director Hector Baggley.\n\nAnother recurring character, making vacant-minded political comments, was the Honourable David J. Broadfoot, Member of Parliament for [[Kicking Horse Pass]] and leader of the [[New Apathetic Party]]. Broadfoot had been performing as this character for years, and had appeared on Canadian and American television as \"The Honourable Member\" as early as the 1950s, long before his tenure with Air Farce.\n\nAir Farce Productions Inc., which was incorporated in 1978, is the legal owner of the Royal Canadian Air Farce and owns the troupe's output. John Morgan, Roger Abbott, and Don Ferguson were the long-time business partners. Morgan sold his share of the company to Abbot and Ferguson, when he retired in 2001. Since the death of Abbot in 2011, Don Ferguson has been the company's sole owner. Ferguson has been the producer of the Air Farce television series since 2004 and has been the executive producer of the annual Air Farce New Year's Eve specials since 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0272416/ |title=Don Ferguson |website=IMDB.com |accessdate=December 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Trying out TV ===\nIn 1977, Air Farce writers Abbott, Broadfoot, Ferguson, and Morgan adapted several of their radio sketches for television, in addition to writing new material. The sketches were aired as the first two episodes of the six-part CBC series ''[[Krazy House]]'', a compendium of sketch comedy pieces from various Canadian writers and performers that aired in January and February 1977. Broadfoot was the only Air Farce cast member to appear on-camera in these two episodes, which also starred [[Billy Van]], amongst others. The fifth episode of ''Krazy House'' was written entirely by Morgan, and featured Air Farce cast member Luba Goy along with Billy Van, [[Harvey Atkin]], and others.\n \nThe Farce troupe recorded a one-hour television special in 1980, which evolved into a ten-week series and two sequel specials in addition to their regular radio series. The shows were performed in front of a live studio audience, mixing fully produced sketches with some sketches that were essentially staged versions of the radio show, featuring the cast members standing around a microphone reading from scripts rather than acting out the roles. Despite the decent ratings for the initial special, simply staging the radio sketches did not translate well on television, and the Air Farce faded from CBC TV by 1983. In 1984, the troupe's live Toronto stage show was videotaped as a pay-TV special, and subsequently broadcast on Ontario's [[Global Television Network]].<ref name=history>{{cite web |url=http://www.airfarce.com/history.html |title=History of Air Farce |accessdate=2014-12-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205080424/http://www.airfarce.com/history.html |archivedate=2014-12-05 }}</ref>\n\nThe troupe continued on radio though, where they flourished for the next decade. While the first decade of the show was largely recorded before a live audience at CBC Radio's Cabbagetown studio in Toronto, from 1984 to 1992 the show was recorded for broadcast on the road in communities across Canada. In this period, troupe also performed in non-broadcast concert and theatrical performances across North America.<ref name=history/> Some popular sketches in the late 1980s and early 1990s included \"joint broadcasts\" by CTV and CBC, overlaying opening theme music. When ''[[The Journal (Canadian TV show)|The Journal]]'' debuted on CBC in 1982, Air Farce spoofed the program's repeated use of the \"sounder\", and the use of satellite to connect people to talk to one another (including husband in living room to wife in the kitchen), as well as the seeming similarity between original hosts [[Barbara Frum]] and [[Mary Lou Finlay]].\n\nIn the early 1980s, Air Farce's summer radio hiatus periods were filled by another comedy troupe, [[The Frantics (comedy)|the Frantics]], who later moved on to their own TV series, ''[[Four on the Floor (Canadian TV series)|Four on the Floor]]''. Later summer hiatus periods, however, were filled by Ferguson and Abbott playing classic comedy recordings, or by newer comedy troupes such as [[Radio Free Vestibule]]. In the late 1980s, CBC Radio launched another 30-minutes weekly political satire, ''[[Double Exposure (comedy series)|Double Exposure]]''.\n\nBroadfoot retired from the troupe in 1989, although he continued to make guest appearances with Air Farce for many years afterward, on both radio and TV. [[Barbara Budd]] was also a frequent guest of the troupe, appearing in many radio episodes of the 1980s and early 1990s, although she was never an official cast member.\n\n=== Success with TV ===\n\nIn 1992, Air Farce took a second plunge into television with ''1992: Year of the Farce'', a satirical [[New Year's Eve]] special. This time, the troupe elected to perform all their sketches in a more traditional (if low-budget) TV style, rather than performing some of them in front of a radio microphone. A ratings smash, the special led the troupe to produce another weekly television series, which debuted in 1993. However, this time the move to television was permanent. The radio series continued alongside the TV show for four seasons until May 1997, when it was discontinued.\n\nThe practice of having a show on New Year's Eve continued to the end of the program, and such episodes were typically titled \"Year of the Farce\". In recent years, Air Farce also had the honour of counting down the seconds before the New Year on CBC.\n\nRecurring characters on the TV series included the slow Albertan Mike, from Canmore (Morgan) and angry Scot Jock McBile (Morgan), self-righteous movie critic Gilbert Smythe Bite-Me (Abbott), and chain-smoking bingo player Brenda (Goy). Though these characters would occasionally feature in sketches of their own, usually they were used at the beginning of the show to deliver a stream of [[one-line joke]]s commenting on the news of that week.\n\nThe show also featured frequent sketches with politicians, who were portrayed as various extreme [[caricature]]s of their most infamous personality quirks. Notable re-occurring figures included Prime Minister [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]] (Abbott), who could barely speak a single sentence of English without committing at least a dozen outlandish pronunciation and grammatical errors; the nasally voiced [[Preston Manning]] (Ferguson) who loved to shout \"REFOOOOOOORM!\"; a screaming, bitchy [[Sheila Copps]] (Goy); the tyrannical [[Lucien Bouchard]]; the dopey and overly image conscious [[Stockwell Day]]; the strutting, clucking, pompous [[Joe Clark]]; and the power-hungry [[Paul Martin]] (all Ferguson). Many of the real politicians also made guest appearances on the show, often interacting directly with their parodic counterparts: for example, in one sketch late in the show's run, Ferguson played [[Jack Layton]] answering questions at a press conference; midway through the sketch he requested a moment to consult with his \"top advisor\", and out came the real Jack Layton.\n\nHowever, Colonel \"Teresa\" Stacy (Ferguson) quickly emerged as the show's most popular character\u2014each time he appeared, Stacy would load up the Chicken Cannon and fire [[rubber chicken]]s and other assorted projectiles at whomever he deemed the most annoying public figure of the week (or year).\n\nMorgan retired from Air Farce in 2001, and the remaining three members carried on with a rotating stable of guest stars until [[Jessica Holmes]] joined the show in 2003. Holmes added celebrity figures such as [[Paris Hilton]] and [[Liza Minnelli]], and Canadian politicians such as [[Belinda Stronach]], to the troupe's roster of characters.\n\nLater, in 2005, after a [[lockout (industry)|lockout]] at CBC, Air Farce gained two new cast members, who had previously appeared on the show as recurring guest stars: [[Alan Park]] and [[Craig Lauzon]]. The addition of these two newcomers brought the total number of performers in the troupe to six. Park initially only signed on to do rant-like segments, saying in interviews that he'd never play a character, but ended up taking on roles including [[Barack Obama]]. Lauzon regularly portrayed Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]], taking his stiff public persona and creating a generally [[robotic]] character.\n\nWhile the show was held up as ''de facto'' Canadian tradition, some critics felt that the television show's quality had diminished over the past few seasons, especially since the breakdown of the original four-actor quartet. However, it still continued to draw solid ratings each week.\n\nOn March 30, 2007, the Air Farce celebrated their 300th episode by doing the show on live television (except in Western Canada) for one hour. Roger Abbott and Luba Goy began the show with a brief history of the show, closing with \"the scariest three words on television: AIR FARCE LIVE!\".\n\nAfter this experimental episode, CBC announced that the 15th season of the series would be aired live for the entire season, with a name change to ''[[Air Farce Live]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://entertainment1.sympatico.msn.ca/Air+Farce+goes+for+a+name+change/TV_Guide/TVNews/Articles/070918_airfarce_GD.htm?isfa=1 |title=Air Farce: TV News: TV: Entertainment: Sympatico / MSN<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-10-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009161720/http://entertainment1.sympatico.msn.ca/Air+Farce+goes+for+a+name+change/TV_Guide/TVNews/Articles/070918_airfarce_GD.htm?isfa=1 |archive-date=2007-10-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref> With the new live format, [[Penelope Corrin]], who filled in for Holmes during her pregnancy in early 2007, officially joined the troupe, increasing its number to seven.\n\nAbbott, Morgan, Goy, Ferguson, and Broadfoot had cameo appearances in ''[[The Red Green Show]]'''s movie spinoff ''[[Duct Tape Forever]]''.\n\nOn April 1, 2008, the CBC and Air Farce jointly announced that the Royal Canadian Air Farce would wrap up its weekly television show in the 2008/2009 season. The plan as announced was for nine new Air Farce shows to be produced for the fall of 2008, and then the series would end with a New Year's Eve special at the end of 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2008/04/01/air-farce.html |work=CBC News |title=Royal Canadian Air Farce set to end |date=April 1, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506093913/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2008/04/01/air-farce.html |archivedate=May 6, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Television/TV_Shows/R/Royal_Canadian_Air_Farce/2008/04/02/5170791-sun.html |title=CBC comedy 'Air Farce' grounded |access-date=2008-04-01 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710210412/http://jam.canoe.ca/Television/TV_Shows/R/Royal_Canadian_Air_Farce/2008/04/02/5170791-sun.html |archive-date=2012-07-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===New Year's Eve reunion specials===\nAir Farce returned on December 31, 2009 for a New Year's special, featuring the return of most of the original cast (excluding Jessica Holmes, who had a theatrical commitment).

Although their weekly radio series ended in 1997 and  their television series ended in 2008, the troupe remained active  until 2019, with annual [[New Year's Eve]] specials on [[CBC Television]]. CBC announced that, due to budgetary constraints, the special scheduled to air on December 30, 2019 would be the final in the series.<ref name=finale>{{cite news |last1=Brioux |first1=Bill |title=CBC cancels Air Farce New Year's Eve special, troupe gets one last hurrah on Dec. 30 |url=https://www.timescolonist.com/cbc-cancels-air-farce-new-year-s-eve-special-troupe-gets-one-last-hurrah-on-dec-30-1.23967222 |accessdate=October 5, 2019 |work=(Victoria) Times-Colonist |agency=Canadian Press |date=October 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Theatre revue and radio years ===\nThe group started in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] in 1970 as an improvisational theatre revue called ''The Jest Society'', a pun on then-[[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s famous goal of making Canada a [[Just society#Canadian usage|\"just society\"]]. The original cast was [[John Morgan (comedian)|John Morgan]], [[Martin Bronstein]], [[Patrick Conlon (journalist)|Patrick Conlon]], [[Gay Claitman]], and [[Roger Abbott]]. The troupe moved to Toronto where it had a long-term residency at the [[Poor Alex Theatre]].  Steve Whistance-Smith was briefly a member, replacing Patrick Conlon who declined to continue commuting to Toronto from Montreal, and then [[Don Ferguson (actor)|Don Ferguson]] joined when Whistance-Smith left.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbc.ca/programguide/personality/don_ferguson |title=Don Ferguson |work=CBC Program Guide |accessdate=December 29, 2019}}</ref> The show was favourably reviewed by local theatre critics, attracting the attention of [[CBC Radio]], which commissioned the troupe to perform sketches on its weekly variety show, ''[[The Entertainers (radio program)|The Entertainers]]''; the sketches were taped at a CBC studio without a live audience.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://torontoguardian.com/2017/06/air-farce-canada-150-ferguson/ |title=Don Ferguson, Air Farce and 150 Years of Funny |date=June 30, 2017 |first=Dean |last=Young |publisher=Toronto Guardian|accessdate=December 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter a number of personnel changes, the group became the \"Royal Canadian Air Farce\" in 1973 when the troupe was given its own show, taped in front of a live audience at the Curtain Club in [[Richmond Hill, Ontario]]. The CBC gives the date of the first broadcast as December 9, 1973.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://airfarce.com/about#intro |title=About: Intro |website=airfarce.com|access-date=April 28, 2019 }}</ref> By this time the lineup consisted of Roger Abbott, [[Luba Goy]], John Morgan, [[Dave Broadfoot]], and Martin Bronstein. At this point  Don Ferguson was a writer on the show. They quickly became one of the network's most popular programs. Most of their later shows were based in Toronto and recorded in CBC's [[Cabbagetown (Toronto)|Cabbagetown]] Studios; however as the troupe became more popular, they frequently travelled throughout the country to record their weekly radio broadcasts, which featured a mixture of political and cultural satire heavily influenced by the style of [[Wayne and Shuster]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Desiring Canada: CBC Contests, Hockey Violence and Other Stately Pleasures|page=176|author=Patricia Cormack and James Cosgrave|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1442663305}}</ref> The touring show also often included one or more sketches satirizing local culture or politics, which were not aired on the national radio broadcast.\n\nBronstein ceased performing with the troupe in 1974 to pursue a full-time journalism career, but continued to write for the Air Farce until the late 1970s. Ferguson, who had been a writer on the show's first season, swapped placed with Bronstein, becoming a writer-performer.<ref>[http://www.squashtalk.com/html/news/bronsteinbio.htm Martin Bronstein's Bio 1999-2003 copyright SquashTalk.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121184359/http://www.squashtalk.com/html/news/bronsteinbio.htm |date=2008-11-21 }}</ref> In 1977, non-performing writers [[Gord Holtam]] and [[Rick Olsen]] joined the crew. In the late 1970s during a trip to [[Los Angeles]], Abbott and Ferguson were offered jobs writing for the new television sitcom ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]'', but opted to remain with ''Air Farce'' instead.<ref>\"Remembering Roger Abbott\". ''[[Q (radio show)|Q]]'', March 28, 2011.</ref>\n\n[[Recurring character]]s included addle-brained hockey player Big Bobby Clobber (Broadfoot), [[Sgt. Renfrew#Parody|Sgt. Renfrew]] of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (Broadfoot), and socialite Amy De La Pompa (Morgan), along with political figures such as [[Brian Mulroney]], [[Joe Clark]], and [[Pierre Trudeau]]. Additional characters included Prof. Hieronymus Wombat of the [[National Research Council of Canada|National Research Council]] and funeral director Hector Baggley.\n\nAnother recurring character, making vacant-minded political comments, was the Honourable David J. Broadfoot, Member of Parliament for [[Kicking Horse Pass]] and leader of the [[New Apathetic Party]]. Broadfoot had been performing as this character for years, and had appeared on Canadian and American television as \"The Honourable Member\" as early as the 1950s, long before his tenure with Air Farce.\n\nAir Farce Productions Inc., which was incorporated in 1978, is the legal owner of the Royal Canadian Air Farce and owns the troupe's output. John Morgan, Roger Abbott, and Don Ferguson were the long-time business partners. Morgan sold his share of the company to Abbot and Ferguson, when he retired din 2001. Since the death of Abbot in 2011, Don Ferguson has been the company's sole owner. Ferguson has been the producer of the Air Farce television series since 2004 and has been the executive producer of the annual Air Farce New Year's Eve specials since 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0272416/ |title=Don Ferguson |website=IMDB.com |accessdate=December 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Trying out TV ===\nIn 1977, Air Farce writers Abbott, Broadfoot, Ferguson, and Morgan adapted several of their radio sketches for television, in addition to writing new material. The sketches were aired as the first two episodes of the six-part CBC series ''[[Krazy House]]'', a compendium of sketch comedy pieces from various Canadian writers and performers that aired in January and February 1977. Broadfoot was the only Air Farce cast member to appear on-camera in these two episodes, which also starred [[Billy Van]], amongst others. The fifth episode of ''Krazy House'' was written entirely by Morgan, and featured Air Farce cast member Luba Goy along with Billy Van, [[Harvey Atkin]], and others.\n \nThe Farce troupe recorded a one-hour television special in 1980, which evolved into a ten-week series and two sequel specials in addition to their regular radio series. The shows were performed in front of a live studio audience, mixing fully produced sketches with some sketches that were essentially staged versions of the radio show, featuring the cast members standing around a microphone reading from scripts rather than acting out the roles. Despite the decent ratings for the initial special, simply staging the radio sketches did not translate well on television, and the Air Farce faded from CBC TV by 1983. In 1984, the troupe's live Toronto stage show was videotaped as a pay-TV special, and subsequently broadcast on Ontario's [[Global Television Network]].<ref name=history>{{cite web |url=http://www.airfarce.com/history.html |title=History of Air Farce |accessdate=2014-12-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205080424/http://www.airfarce.com/history.html |archivedate=2014-12-05 }}</ref>\n\nThe troupe continued on radio though, where they flourished for the next decade. While the first decade of the show was largely recorded before a live audience at CBC Radio's Cabbagetown studio in Toronto, from 1984 to 1992 the show was recorded for broadcast on the road in communities across Canada. In this period, troupe also performed in non-broadcast concert and theatrical performances across North America.<ref name=history/> Some popular sketches in the late 1980s and early 1990s included \"joint broadcasts\" by CTV and CBC, overlaying opening theme music. When ''[[The Journal (Canadian TV show)|The Journal]]'' debuted on CBC in 1982, Air Farce spoofed the program's repeated use of the \"sounder\", and the use of satellite to connect people to talk to one another (including husband in living room to wife in the kitchen), as well as the seeming similarity between original hosts [[Barbara Frum]] and [[Mary Lou Finlay]].\n\nIn the early 1980s, Air Farce's summer radio hiatus periods were filled by another comedy troupe, [[The Frantics (comedy)|the Frantics]], who later moved on to their own TV series, ''[[Four on the Floor (Canadian TV series)|Four on the Floor]]''. Later summer hiatus periods, however, were filled by Ferguson and Abbott playing classic comedy recordings, or by newer comedy troupes such as [[Radio Free Vestibule]]. In the late 1980s, CBC Radio launched another 30-minutes weekly political satire, ''[[Double Exposure (comedy series)|Double Exposure]]''.\n\nBroadfoot retired from the troupe in 1989, although he continued to make guest appearances with Air Farce for many years afterward, on both radio and TV. [[Barbara Budd]] was also a frequent guest of the troupe, appearing in many radio episodes of the 1980s and early 1990s, although she was never an official cast member.\n\n=== Success with TV ===\n\nIn 1992, Air Farce took a second plunge into television with ''1992: Year of the Farce'', a satirical [[New Year's Eve]] special. This time, the troupe elected to perform all their sketches in a more traditional (if low-budget) TV style, rather than performing some of them in front of a radio microphone. A ratings smash, the special led the troupe to produce another weekly television series, which debuted in 1993. However, this time the move to television was permanent. The radio series continued alongside the TV show for four seasons until May 1997, when it was discontinued.\n\nThe practice of having a show on New Year's Eve continued to the end of the program, and such episodes were typically titled \"Year of the Farce\". In recent years, Air Farce also had the honour of counting down the seconds before the New Year on CBC.\n\nRecurring characters on the TV series included the slow Albertan Mike, from Canmore (Morgan) and angry Scot Jock McBile (Morgan), self-righteous movie critic Gilbert Smythe Bite-Me (Abbott), and chain-smoking bingo player Brenda (Goy). Though these characters would occasionally feature in sketches of their own, usually they were used at the beginning of the show to deliver a stream of [[one-line joke]]s commenting on the news of that week.\n\nThe show also featured frequent sketches with politicians, who were portrayed as various extreme [[caricature]]s of their most infamous personality quirks. Notable re-occurring figures included Prime Minister [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]] (Abbott), who could barely speak a single sentence of English without committing at least a dozen outlandish pronunciation and grammatical errors; the nasally voiced [[Preston Manning]] (Ferguson) who loved to shout \"REFOOOOOOORM!\"; a screaming, bitchy [[Sheila Copps]] (Goy); the tyrannical [[Lucien Bouchard]]; the dopey and overly image conscious [[Stockwell Day]]; the strutting, clucking, pompous [[Joe Clark]]; and the power-hungry [[Paul Martin]] (all Ferguson). Many of the real politicians also made guest appearances on the show, often interacting directly with their parodic counterparts: for example, in one sketch late in the show's run, Ferguson played [[Jack Layton]] answering questions at a press conference; midway through the sketch he requested a moment to consult with his \"top advisor\", and out came the real Jack Layton.\n\nHowever, Colonel \"Teresa\" Stacy (Ferguson) quickly emerged as the show's most popular character\u2014each time he appeared, Stacy would load up the Chicken Cannon and fire [[rubber chicken]]s and other assorted projectiles at whomever he deemed the most annoying public figure of the week (or year).\n\nMorgan retired from Air Farce in 2001, and the remaining three members carried on with a rotating stable of guest stars until [[Jessica Holmes]] joined the show in 2003. Holmes added celebrity figures such as [[Paris Hilton]] and [[Liza Minnelli]], and Canadian politicians such as [[Belinda Stronach]], to the troupe's roster of characters.\n\nLater, in 2005, after a [[lockout (industry)|lockout]] at CBC, Air Farce gained two new cast members, who had previously appeared on the show as recurring guest stars: [[Alan Park]] and [[Craig Lauzon]]. The addition of these two newcomers brought the total number of performers in the troupe to six. Park initially only signed on to do rant-like segments, saying in interviews that he'd never play a character, but ended up taking on roles including [[Barack Obama]]. Lauzon regularly portrayed Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]], taking his stiff public persona and creating a generally [[robotic]] character.\n\nWhile the show was held up as ''de facto'' Canadian tradition, some critics felt that the television show's quality had diminished over the past few seasons, especially since the breakdown of the original four-actor quartet. However, it still continued to draw solid ratings each week.\n\nOn March 30, 2007, the Air Farce celebrated their 300th episode by doing the show on live television (except in Western Canada) for one hour. Roger Abbott and Luba Goy began the show with a brief history of the show, closing with \"the scariest three words on television: AIR FARCE LIVE!\".\n\nAfter this experimental episode, CBC announced that the 15th season of the series would be aired live for the entire season, with a name change to ''[[Air Farce Live]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://entertainment1.sympatico.msn.ca/Air+Farce+goes+for+a+name+change/TV_Guide/TVNews/Articles/070918_airfarce_GD.htm?isfa=1 |title=Air Farce: TV News: TV: Entertainment: Sympatico / MSN<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-10-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009161720/http://entertainment1.sympatico.msn.ca/Air+Farce+goes+for+a+name+change/TV_Guide/TVNews/Articles/070918_airfarce_GD.htm?isfa=1 |archive-date=2007-10-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref> With the new live format, [[Penelope Corrin]], who filled in for Holmes during her pregnancy in early 2007, officially joined the troupe, increasing its number to seven.\n\nAbbott, Morgan, Goy, Ferguson, and Broadfoot had cameo appearances in ''[[The Red Green Show]]'''s movie spinoff ''[[Duct Tape Forever]]''.\n\nOn April 1, 2008, the CBC and Air Farce jointly announced that the Royal Canadian Air Farce would wrap up its weekly television show in the 2008/2009 season. The plan as announced was for nine new Air Farce shows to be produced for the fall of 2008, and then the series would end with a New Year's Eve special at the end of 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2008/04/01/air-farce.html |work=CBC News |title=Royal Canadian Air Farce set to end |date=April 1, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506093913/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2008/04/01/air-farce.html |archivedate=May 6, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Television/TV_Shows/R/Royal_Canadian_Air_Farce/2008/04/02/5170791-sun.html |title=CBC comedy 'Air Farce' grounded |access-date=2008-04-01 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710210412/http://jam.canoe.ca/Television/TV_Shows/R/Royal_Canadian_Air_Farce/2008/04/02/5170791-sun.html |archive-date=2012-07-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===New Year's Eve reunion specials===\nAir Farce returned on December 31, 2009 for a New Year's special, featuring the return of most of the original cast (excluding Jessica Holmes, who had a theatrical commitment).

Flight time to [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] is 3 hours or longer, depending on weather. Adak is the southernmost community in Alaska and on the same latitude as [[Haida Gwaii]] in Canada, and [[Brussels]], Belgium. It is less than three degrees of latitude north of the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]], which forms the western part of the land border between the [[Contiguous United States]] and Canada. \n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|127.3|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|122.4|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|4.9|sqmi|km2}} (3.87%) is water.\n\n==Climate==\nAdak lies in the [[subpolar oceanic climate]] zone, characterized by persistently overcast skies, moderated temperatures, high winds, significant precipitation and frequent [[Aleutian Low|cyclonic storms]]. Winter squalls produce wind gusts in excess of {{convert|100|kn|mph km/h|lk=in|-1}}. During the summer, extensive fog forms over the [[Bering Sea]] and [[North Pacific]]. Average temperatures range from {{convert|20|to|60|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, but [[wind chill]] factors can be severe. Average annual precipitation is {{convert|65.6|in|mm}} annually, concentrated markedly in fall and winter. December is the wettest single month on average, while June and July are markedly the driest months, with thunderstorms virtually unknown here. Snowfall averages nearly {{convert|100|in|mm}} per winter season, which however tends to melt soon after falling. With 263 rainy days per year, Adak has the second highest number of any inhabited locality in the United States after [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo]], [[Hawaii]].\n\n{{Weather box|location = Adak, Alaska|width=77%\n|single line = y\n|Jan record high F = 50\n|Feb record high F = 51\n|Mar record high F = 51\n|Apr record high F = 56\n|May record high F = 65\n|Jun record high F = 67\n|Jul record high F = 73\n|Aug record high F = 75\n|Sep record high F = 71\n|Oct record high F = 61\n|Nov record high F = 57\n|Dec record high F = 55\n|year record high F =75\n|Jan high F = 37.2\n|Feb high F = 37.0\n|Mar high F = 38.6\n|Apr high F = 41.3\n|May high F = 45.1\n|Jun high F = 49.1\n|Jul high F = 54.0\n|Aug high F = 55.8\n|Sep high F = 52.3\n|Oct high F = 46.9\n|Nov high F = 41.4\n|Dec high F = 38.0\n|year high F =44.7\n|Jan mean F = 33.1\n|Feb mean F = 32.8\n|Mar mean F = 34.4\n|Apr mean F = 37.1\n|May mean F = 40.9\n|Jun mean F = 45.0\n|Jul mean F = 49.4\n|Aug mean F = 51.2\n|Sep mean F = 48.0\n|Oct mean F = 42.6\n|Nov mean F = 37.2\n|Dec mean F = 34.0\n|year mean F = 40.5\n|Jan low F = 28.9\n|Feb low F = 28.5\n|Mar low F = 30.1\n|Apr low F = 32.9\n|May low F = 36.6\n|Jun low F = 40.8\n|Jul low F = 44.7\n|Aug low F = 46.6\n|Sep low F = 43.6\n|Oct low F = 38.2\n|Nov low F = 33.0\n|Dec low F = 29.9\n|year low F =36.2\n|Jan record low F =  3\n|Feb record low F =  3\n|Mar record low F = 12\n|Apr record low F = 20\n|May record low F = 20\n|Jun record low F = 29\n|Jul record low F = 33\n|Aug record low F = 34\n|Sep record low F = 28\n|Oct record low F = 22\n|Nov record low F = 12\n|Dec record low F =  8\n|year record low F = 3\n|precipitation colour=green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 6.74\n|Feb precipitation inch = 5.43\n|Mar precipitation inch = 6.14\n|Apr precipitation inch = 4.33\n|May precipitation inch = 4.84\n|Jun precipitation inch = 3.34\n|Jul precipitation inch = 2.99\n|Aug precipitation inch = 4.30\n|Sep precipitation inch = 5.52\n|Oct precipitation inch = 7.00\n|Nov precipitation inch = 7.33\n|Dec precipitation inch = 7.66\n|Jan precipitation days = 24\n|Feb precipitation days = 22\n|Mar precipitation days = 25\n|Apr precipitation days = 22\n|May precipitation days = 22\n|Jun precipitation days = 17\n|Jul precipitation days = 16\n|Aug precipitation days = 19\n|Sep precipitation days = 21\n|Oct precipitation days = 25\n|Nov precipitation days = 25\n|Dec precipitation days = 25\n|unit precipitation days = 0.01 inch\n|Jan snow inch = 18.1\n|Feb snow inch = 18.4\n|Mar snow inch = 20.1\n|Apr snow inch = 10.0\n|May snow inch =  1.5\n|Jun snow inch =  0\n|Jul snow inch =  0\n|Aug snow inch =  0\n|Sep snow inch =  0.1\n|Oct snow inch =  1.5\n|Nov snow inch = 10.4\n|Dec snow inch = 19.3\n|source = WRCC<ref name = \"ADAK, ALASKA\" >{{cite web| url = http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?akadak| title = ADAK, ALASKA (500026)| publisher = Western Regional Climate Centre | accessdate = 2011-10-31| format = PDF}}</ref> |date=September 2011}}\n\n==History and culture==\n'''19th century'''\n\nThe Aleutian Islands were historically occupied by the [[Aleut people|Unanga]], more commonly known now as the Aleuts. The once heavily populated island was eventually abandoned in the early 19th century as the Aleutian Island hunters followed the Russian fur trade eastward, and famine set in on the Andreanof Island group. However, they continued to hunt and fish actively around the island over the years, until [[World War II]] broke out.\n\n'''Military involvement and the naval station'''\n\nAdak Army installations allowed U.S. forces to mount a successful offensive against the [[Japan]]ese-held islands of [[Kiska]] and [[Attu Island|Attu]]. After the war, Adak was developed as a [[Naval Air Facility Adak|naval air station]], playing an important role during the [[Cold War]] as a [[SOSUS|submarine surveillance center]]. Large earthquakes rocked the island in 1957, 1964 and 1977.\n\n[[File:Abandoned military facilities on Adak Island. Aleutian Islands, Alaska.jpg|thumb|alt=A series of large concrete buildings with peeling paint, clearly in a state of disrepair|Abandoned military buildings on Adak Island. These buildings house a basketball court, squash court, saunas, bowling alley, and more, all in an unusable state of disrepair.]]At its peak, the station housed over 6,000 naval and Coast Guard personnel and their families. In 1994, the base was downsized, and both family housing and schools were closed. The station officially closed on March 31, 1997, as a result of [[1995 Base Realignment and Closure Commission]] (BRAC). [[The Aleut Corporation]] purchased Adak's facilities under a land transfer agreement with the Department of the Interior and the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]]/[[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. This agreement was finalized in March, 2004. About 30 families with children relocated to Adak in September 1998, most of them Aleut Corp. shareholders, and the former high school was reopened at that time as a K-12 institution. The community incorporated as a second-class city in April, 2001. Substantially all of the infrastructure and facilities on Adak are owned by Aleut Corporation, which is currently developing Adak as a commercial center via their subsidiary companies. For example, properties in active use are leased by Adak Commercial Properties, LLC.\n\nSince World War II, the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard developed facilities and recreation opportunities at Adak. At its peak, Adak had a college, a [[McDonald's]] restaurant, a Baskin-Robbins ice cream stand, movie theater, roller skating rink, swimming pool, ski lodge, bowling alleys, skeet range, auto hobby shop, photo lab, and racquetball & tennis courts. A new $18-million hospital was built in 1990, just seven years prior to the closure of the station. By March 2003, six years after the closure of the station, most of these facilities had closed.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population|align=left\n|1970= 2249\n|1980= 3315\n|1990= 4633\n|2000= 316\n|2010= 326\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=329\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAdak first appeared on the 2000 U.S. Census as a census-designated place (CDP),<ref>https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/phc-1-3.pdf</ref> although it previously was the Adak Naval Station from 1970<ref>https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1970a_ak-01.pdf</ref><ref>https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1980a_akABCD-01.pdf</ref> to 1990.<ref>https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph5/cph-5-3.pdf</ref> In 2001, it formally incorporated as a city.

The racial makeup of the city was 49.68% [[Race (United States Census)|White]], 1.27% [[Race (United States Census)|Black]] or [[Race (United States Census)|African American]], 35.13% [[Race (United States Census)|Native American]], 9.81% [[Race (United States Census)|Asian]], 1.90% [[Race (United States Census)|Pacific Islander]], and 2.22% from two or more races.  5.06% of the population were [[Race (United States Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Race (United States Census)|Latino]] of any race.\n\nOf the 159 households 18.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 28.9% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 2.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 61.6% were non-families. 46.5% of all households were made up of individuals and none had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 1.99 and the average family size was 2.90.\n\nIn the city, the population was spread out with 18.7% under the age of 18, 9.5% from 18 to 24, 44.3% from 25 to 44, 26.3% from 45 to 64, and 1.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females, there were 184.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 188.8 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the city was $52,727, and the median income for a family was $53,889. Males had a median income of $46,429 versus $35,000 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $31,747. About 3.3% of families and 4.7% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], none of whom were under the age of eighteen or over the age of sixty-five.\n\n==Utilities, schools, and health care==\n'''Water'''\nWater is derived from Lake Bonnie Rose, Lake De Marie, and Nurses Creek, stored in seven water tanks throughout the community, and piped to facilities and housing units. The wastewater treatment system discharges through a marine outfall line to Kuluk Bay. Adak's water system is reported to have<!--to avoid false positives in search for 'have led/lead' typo --> lead in it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://adak-ak.us/content/pbntc/160509.pdf|title=City of Adak, Alaska Adak Municipal Utilities|last=|first=|date=2013|website=adak-ak.us|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n'''Waste'''\nWaste was previously removed of by a permitted landfill site; This site was operated on Adak Island under Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (Alaska DEC) solid waste regulations. The landfill operated from the early 1950s until 1972 and from 1975 until 2002. The site was used to dispose of sanitary trash, metal debris, batteries, solvents, waste paints, and construction rubble. From 1975 on, the landfill only accepted sanitary trash.\n\nThe landfill was closed in 1997 by placing a low permeability soil cover over the landfill, implementing access restrictions, installing surface erosion controls, and placing a vegetative cover. In March 2002, the State of Alaska approved resumption of operations at Roberts Landfill through 2002 to dispose of inert demolition waste monofill and one cell for disposal of approximately 10 cubic yards of asbestos-containing material. Alaska DEC approved closure of the landfill in 2002.\n\n'''Identified Contaminants'''\nMetals and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in groundwater and surface water.\n\n'''Current Actions'''\nThe Navy inspects institutional controls (ICs) annually. The Navy conducts groundwater monitoring at four wells and surface water monitoring at five locations annually.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://adak-ak.us/www/ICs/swmu25_example.html|title=SWMU 25 - Roberts Landfill ADEC Solid Waste Site {{!}} Institutional Controls {{!}} Adak Island|website=adak-ak.us|access-date=2019-11-24}}</ref>\n\n'''Electricity'''\nElectricity is provided by TDX who have invested over 1 million dollars in improving generating and distribution systems. The price of electricity has been reported to have been reduced due to a greater reliance on wind power.\n\n'''Schools''' \nThere is one school located in the community: Adak School, operated by the [[Aleutian Region School District]].<ref>\"[http://www.aleutregion.org/about_us_111334 Adak School Information].\" [[Aleutian Region School District]].

Overage use is extremely expensive, and a [[monopoly]] exists because personal satellite internet is not available due to the satellite locations. Solar activity blocks communications during [[equinox]] seasons for several days of both spring and fall seasons. Due to its remoteness the internet connection is very poor, applications that require high bandwidth will not work as intended, and can only be picked up in various \"hot spots\" within the town.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://adak-ak.us/content/info/visitinfo15.pdf|title=Adak Visitor Information}}</ref>\n\nThere are no radio stations within 200 miles (320&nbsp;km) of Adak; radio can be received in Adak only through satellite or shortwave receivers.\n\n'''Healthcare''' \nThere is no hospital; however there is Adak Community Health Center, managed by [[Eastern Aleutian Tribes]], Inc (EAT).\n\nThe health center provides Family Medicine, Chronic Care and urgent care services, and is staffed by a physician-assistant or, at times, by a community health practitioner. There is no doctor, no blood supply, and limited medications to stabilize a patient awaiting a medical evacuation, weather permitting. Behavioral Health is also provided via tele-video and quarterly site visits.  EAT sends a dentist to Adak one week per year to provide limited dental services; otherwise, dental services must be referred outside of Adak. Tele-Radiology (X-ray) and Tele-Medicine are also present.  Limited lab, pharmacy, and public health services are also available. The pharmacy medications are limited to acute medications. Filling of prescriptions from outside facilities usually cannot be accommodated. All visitors should bring plenty of their own medications as the health center stocks a very limited supply of chronic medications. Auxiliary emergency health care is provided by Adak Volunteer Fire Department.\n\n==Facilities, economy and transportation==\n[[File:EAT Logo.jpg|thumb|Logo on side of vehicle owned by Eastern Aleutian Tribes Inc.]]A land exchange between Aleut Corp., the U.S. Navy, and the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] transferred most of the former naval facilities to the Aleut Corp. in March 2004. A portion of the island remains within the [[Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge]], managed by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]. The U.S. Navy retains part of the north end of Adak Island (Parcel 4) and does annual sweeps of the [[Andrew Lake (Alaska)|Andrew Lake]] Seawall for unexploded ordnance. Their website lists the Institutional Controls in place for all of Adak as part of the land exchange or Interim Conveyance. The Navy provides the trail maps as part of the ordnance awareness information required to be shown to all Adak residents and visitors. Adak currently provides a fueling port and crew transfer facility for a combination of Seattle and Alaskan based [[fishing]] fleet &mdash; an [[Adak Airport|airport]], docks, housing facilities, restaurant, grocery, and ship supply store are available. Golden Harvest Alaska Seafood, LLC, a family-owned and -operated Alaskan Seafood Facility, has revived the community of Adak and employs over 250 Americans from all over the US. Golden Harvest's 144,000-square-foot processing facility is fully equipped with a massive dock, allowing them to service fishing vessels and ocean freight barges of all sizes. It has access to the airplane strip, allowing them to air freight orders. Golden Harvest is working with the Alaskan Government to make Adak a User-Free Facility, allowing them to bring in large cargo planes and barges to ship direct from Adak to world markets. They have successfully chartered entire planes full of Live King Crab to China. Golden Harvest processes Pacific cod, pollock, mackerel, halibut, snow and king crabs. Four residents hold commercial fishing permits, primarily for groundfish; however, commercial fishing vessels based out of Seattle and other parts of Alaska provide most of the work for the fish plant by regularly offloading their catch in Adak.\n\nBecause of its naval aviation past, Adak has an unusually large and sophisticated airport for the Aleutian Islands. [[File:Alaska Airlines at Adak.jpg|thumb|Alaska Airlines at Adak Airport]] The airport is currently operated by the State of Alaska Department of Transportation. Complete with an [[Instrument Landing System]], [[Adak Airport]] has no control tower and two 200' wide asphalt paved runways at 19' elevation. One runway measures 7,790' long while the other runway measures 7,605'. Alaska Airlines operates twice-weekly Boeing 737 passenger jet service from Anchorage. At present, flights operate each Wednesday and Saturday, weather permitting. Occasionally, extra seasonal flights are operated to meet the demand of the fishing season.\n\nOther facilities in Adak include three deep water docks and fueling facilities. The city has requested funds to greatly expand the Sweeper Cove small boat harbor, including new breakwaters, a {{convert|315|ft|m|0|adj=on}} dock and new moorage floats {{Attribution needed|date=August 2010}}. There are approximately {{convert|16|mi|km|0}} of paved and primitive roads on Adak, all privately owned by the Aleut Corporation.\n\nThe Aleut are also seeking to develop their water system, which has been well-maintained and -designed for a larger Naval population, as an export industry.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Alaska Journal of Commerce |date=August 20, 2010 |title=Aleut Corp. wants to export Adak water |author=Wesley Loy |url=http://www.alaskajournal.com/stories/082010/loc_adw.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823223357/http://www.alaskajournal.com/stories/082010/loc_adw.shtml |archivedate=2010-08-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Tourism==\n{{manual|date=January 2020}}\n{{more footnotes|date=May 2015}}\n[[Image:Kuluk Bowl Adak Aug 2007.jpg|thumb|right|At Kuluk Bowl for bowling August 2007]]\n\n[[File:A hunter at sunrise on Adak, with Mt.

There are no radio stations within 200 miles (320 km) of Adak; radio can be received in Adak only through satellite or shortwave receivers.\"\n\nThere are multiple different locations to stay in the city; the former naval base housing can be rented by various companies for long and short stays. Unfortunately cabins that were once maintained by Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge have fallen into disrepair and are unsafe to occupy. Camping is legal without a permit on the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge land but due to the harsh climate it is not recommended to do so. The wind on Adak is highly variable and often unpredictable (the record speed is unknown because the wind ripped the anemometer off of the tower).\n\nBirdwatchers often travel to Adak and nearby Attu Island, as many vagrant birds from Asia and elsewhere can be spotted there. Bald Eagles exist there in high numbers.\n\nDeveloped trails are limited and most are not maintained. It is possible to hike on the tundra, but visitors are advised both to prepare for frequent weather changes and to never hike alone.\n\nNightlife and dining opportunities are few on Adak. The Adak General Store is open sporadically during the week. Two restaurants operate in Adak: the Bay 5 (which is housed in the same annex building with the liquor store) and Blue Bird Cafe.\n\nHunting and fishing continue in Adak, especially [[caribou]]. There is no bag limit for cows, but in 2007, the Board of Game passed new regulations for bulls. Hunting access to the south end of the island involves two licensed local boat charter services: either Aleutian Adventure Tours or Homeward Bound Charters. Anglers can access halibut in the [[Kagalaska Straits]].\n\nHunters must possess an Alaska state hunting license and a harvest ticket for each animal taken; non-residents of Alaska must also possess the appropriate big game tag. Anglers require a sport fishing license. All areas of the island with roads are owned by the Aleut Corporation, and a special permit is required for all non-residents accessing this private property. No ATVs are permitted within the wildlife refuge and the Aleut Corporation only allows ATVs on the roads and trails, not on the tundra. Under Alaska state law, [[wikt:wastage|wastage]] is illegal.<ref name=\"WR1\">{{cite web|url=https://weekendroady.com/2016/10/14/adak-americas-fringe//|publisher=Weekend Roady|accessdate=2017-04-14|date=2016-10-16|title=ADAK \u2013 AMERICA\u2019S FRINGE}}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n* [[David Vann (writer)|David Vann]]: author\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Alaska}}\n* [https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/dcra/DCRAExternal/community/Details/3f694e33-bff6-4cb8-a468-60cb72e9f571 Adak] and [https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/dcra/DCRAExternal/community/Details/8dd56833-769f-45ba-a7e0-23e5a558afde Adak Station] at the Community Database Online from the [[Alaska Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development|Alaska Division of Community and Regional Affairs]]\n* Maps from the [[Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development]]: [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304201029/http://labor.alaska.gov/research/alari/images/maps/6_2_1map.pdf 2000], [https://web.archive.org/web/20151222092405/http://labor.alaska.gov/research/census/placemaps/00065.pdf 2010]\n* [http://www.adakisland.com/ Aleut Corporation's official Adak page]\n* [http://climate.gi.alaska.edu/history/aleutians/adak.html Adak Maps]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130810223218/http://alaskamaritime.fws.gov/visitors-educators/caribhunting/adak.htm Fish and Wildlife Service information for Adak hunters]\n* [http://www.adakupdate.com/ US Navy site documenting Adak environmental hazards]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100823223357/http://www.alaskajournal.com/stories/082010/loc_adw.shtml Alaska Journal: Aleut seek to export Adak Water]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150725180424/http://www.adak-ak.gov/ City Website]\n* [http://navycthistory.com/adakhoyt01.html  Article and pictures of visit to Adak July 2006 by retired Navy veteran]\n* [http://www.tprophet.org/dialtone/adak.htm Narrative travelogue of Adak trip taken August, 2006]\n* [http://www.tprophet.org/alaska2006/adak/ Pictures of Adak taken August, 2006]\n* [http://www.geocities.ws/kwajsurf/Marine_Barracks_Adak_Alaska.html MARINE BARRACKS ADAK ALASKA]\n* [http://www.orneveien.org/adak Photographs of Adak from 1944 from many contributors.]\n* [http://www.adakmemoirs.com/ Adak Memoirs] Memoirs and photos of Adak wanted to preserve history, Nov 2011\n\n{{Aleutians West Census Area, Alaska}}\n\n{{Coord|51.872|N|176.636|W|region:US-AK_type:city(70)_scale:30000|display=title}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cities in Alaska]]\n[[Category:Adak, Alaska| ]]\n[[Category:Cities in Aleutians West Census Area, Alaska]]\n[[Category:Cities in Unorganized Borough, Alaska]]\n[[Category:Populated coastal places in Alaska]]\n[[Category:Road-inaccessible communities of Alaska]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|City in Alaska, United States}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name                            = Adak, Alaska\n| settlement_type                 = [[City (Alaska)|City]]\n| nickname                        = \n| motto                           = <!-- Images -->\n| image_skyline                   = Adak -

Flight time to [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] is 3 hours or longer, depending on weather. Adak is the southernmost community in Alaska and on the same latitude as [[Haida Gwaii]] in Canada, and [[Brussels]], Belgium. It is less than three degrees of latitude north of the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]], which forms the western part of the land border between the [[Contiguous United States]] and Canada. \n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|127.3|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|122.4|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|4.9|sqmi|km2}} (3.87%) is water.\n\n==Climate==\nAdak lies in the [[subpolar oceanic climate]] zone, characterized by persistently overcast skies, moderated temperatures, high winds, significant precipitation and frequent [[Aleutian Low|cyclonic storms]]. Winter squalls produce wind gusts in excess of {{convert|100|kn|mph km/h|lk=in|-1}}. During the summer, extensive fog forms over the [[Bering Sea]] and [[North Pacific]]. Average temperatures range from {{convert|20|to|60|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, but [[wind chill]] factors can be severe. Average annual precipitation is {{convert|65.6|in|mm}} annually, concentrated markedly in fall and winter. December is the wettest single month on average, while June and July are markedly the driest months, with thunderstorms virtually unknown here. Snowfall averages nearly {{convert|100|in|mm}} per winter season, which however tends to melt soon after falling.

The once heavily populated island was eventually abandoned in the early 19th century as the Aleutian Island hunters followed the Russian fur trade eastward, and famine set in on the Andreanof Island group. However, they continued to hunt and fish actively around the island over the years, until [[World War II]] broke out.\n\n'''Military involvement and the naval station'''\n\nAdak Army installations allowed U.S. forces to mount a successful offensive against the [[Japan]]ese-held islands of [[Kiska]] and [[Attu Island|Attu]]. After the war, Adak was developed as a [[Naval Air Facility Adak|naval air station]], playing an important role during the [[Cold War]] as a [[SOSUS|submarine surveillance center]]. Large earthquakes rocked the island in 1957, 1964 and 1977.\n\n[[File:Abandoned military facilities on Adak Island. Aleutian Islands, Alaska.jpg|thumb|alt=A series of large concrete buildings with peeling paint, clearly in a state of disrepair|Abandoned military buildings on Adak Island. These buildings house a basketball court, squash court, saunas, bowling alley, and more, all in an unusable state of disrepair.]]At its peak, the station housed over 6,000 naval and Coast Guard personnel and their families. In 1994, the base was downsized, and both family housing and schools were closed. The station officially closed on March 31, 1997, as a result of [[1995 Base Realignment and Closure Commission]] (BRAC). [[The Aleut Corporation]] purchased Adak's facilities under a land transfer agreement with the Department of the Interior and the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]]/[[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. This agreement was finalized in March, 2004. About 30 families with children relocated to Adak in September 1998, most of them Aleut Corp. shareholders, and the former high school was reopened at that time as a K-12 institution. The community incorporated as a second-class city in April, 2001. Substantially all of the infrastructure and facilities on Adak are owned by Aleut Corporation, which is currently developing Adak as a commercial center via their subsidiary companies. For example, properties in active use are leased by Adak Commercial Properties, LLC.\n\nSince World War II, the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard developed facilities and recreation opportunities at Adak. At its peak, Adak had a college, a [[McDonald's]] restaurant, a Baskin-Robbins ice cream stand, movie theater, roller skating rink, swimming pool, ski lodge, bowling alleys, skeet range, auto hobby shop, photo lab, and racquetball & tennis courts. A new $18-million hospital was built in 1990, just seven years prior to the closure of the station. By March 2003, six years after the closure of the station, most of these facilities had closed.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population|align=left\n|1970= 2249\n|1980= 3315\n|1990= 4633\n|2000= 316\n|2010= 326\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=329\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAdak first appeared on the 2000 U.S. Census as a census-designated place (CDP),<ref>https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/phc-1-3.pdf</ref> although it previously was the Adak Naval Station from 1970<ref>https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1970a_ak-01.pdf</ref><ref>https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1980a_akABCD-01.pdf</ref> to 1990.<ref>https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph5/cph-5-3.pdf</ref> In 2001, it formally incorporated as a city.

Males had a median income of $46,429 versus $35,000 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $31,747. About 3.3% of families and 4.7% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], none of whom were under the age of eighteen or over the age of sixty-five.\n\n==Utilities, schools, and health care==\n'''Water'''\nWater is derived from Lake Bonnie Rose, Lake De Marie, and Nurses Creek, stored in seven water tanks throughout the community, and piped to facilities and housing units.

The landfill operated from the early 1950s until 1972 and from 1975 until 2002. The site was used to dispose of sanitary trash, metal debris, batteries, solvents, waste paints, and construction rubble. From 1975 on, the landfill only accepted sanitary trash.\n\nThe landfill was closed in 1997 by placing a low permeability soil cover over the landfill, implementing access restrictions, installing surface erosion controls, and placing a vegetative cover. In March 2002, the State of Alaska approved resumption of operations at Roberts Landfill through 2002 to dispose of inert demolition waste monofill and one cell for disposal of approximately 10 cubic yards of asbestos-containing material. Alaska DEC approved closure of the landfill in 2002.\n\n'''Identified Contaminants'''\nMetals and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in groundwater and surface water.\n\n'''Current Actions'''\nThe Navy inspects institutional controls (ICs) annually.

Overage use is extremely expensive, and a [[monopoly]] exists because personal satellite internet is not available due to the satellite locations. Solar activity blocks communications during [[equinox]] seasons for several days of both spring and fall seasons. Due to its remoteness the internet connection is very poor, applications that require high bandwidth will not work as intended, and can only be picked up in various \"hot spots\" within the town.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://adak-ak.us/content/info/visitinfo15.pdf|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThere are no radio stations within 200 miles (320&nbsp;km) of Adak; radio can be received in Adak only through satellite or shortwave receivers.\n\n'''Healthcare''' \nThere is no hospital; however there is Adak Community Health Center, managed by [[Eastern Aleutian Tribes]], Inc (EAT).\n\nThe health center provides Family Medicine, Chronic Care and urgent care services, and is staffed by a physician-assistant or, at times, by a community health practitioner. There is no doctor, no blood supply, and limited medications to stabilize a patient awaiting a medical evacuation, weather permitting. Behavioral Health is also provided via tele-video and quarterly site visits.  EAT sends a dentist to Adak one week per year to provide limited dental services; otherwise, dental services must be referred outside of Adak. Tele-Radiology (X-ray) and Tele-Medicine are also present.  Limited lab, pharmacy, and public health services are also available. The pharmacy medications are limited to acute medications. Filling of prescriptions from outside facilities usually cannot be accommodated. All visitors should bring plenty of their own medications as the health center stocks a very limited supply of chronic medications. Auxiliary emergency health care is provided by Adak Volunteer Fire Department.\n\n==Facilities, economy and transportation==\n[[File:EAT Logo.jpg|thumb|Logo on side of vehicle owned by Eastern Aleutian Tribes Inc.]]A land exchange between Aleut Corp., the U.S. Navy, and the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] transferred most of the former naval facilities to the Aleut Corp. in March 2004. A portion of the island remains within the [[Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge]], managed by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]. The U.S. Navy retains part of the north end of Adak Island (Parcel 4) and does annual sweeps of the [[Andrew Lake (Alaska)|Andrew Lake]] Seawall for unexploded ordnance. Their website lists the Institutional Controls in place for all of Adak as part of the land exchange or Interim Conveyance. The Navy provides the trail maps as part of the ordnance awareness information required to be shown to all Adak residents and visitors. Adak currently provides a fueling port and crew transfer facility for a combination of Seattle and Alaskan based [[fishing]] fleet &mdash; an [[Adak Airport|airport]], docks, housing facilities, restaurant, grocery, and ship supply store are available. Golden Harvest Alaska Seafood, LLC, a family-owned and -operated Alaskan Seafood Facility, has revived the community of Adak and employs over 250 Americans from all over the US. Golden Harvest's 144,000-square-foot processing facility is fully equipped with a massive dock, allowing them to service fishing vessels and ocean freight barges of all sizes. It has access to the airplane strip, allowing them to air freight orders. Golden Harvest is working with the Alaskan Government to make Adak a User-Free Facility, allowing them to bring in large cargo planes and barges to ship direct from Adak to world markets. They have successfully chartered entire planes full of Live King Crab to China. Golden Harvest processes Pacific cod, pollock, mackerel, halibut, snow and king crabs. Four residents hold commercial fishing permits, primarily for groundfish; however, commercial fishing vessels based out of Seattle and other parts of Alaska provide most of the work for the fish plant by regularly offloading their catch in Adak.\n\nBecause of its naval aviation past, Adak has an unusually large and sophisticated airport for the Aleutian Islands. [[File:Alaska Airlines at Adak.jpg|thumb|Alaska Airlines at Adak Airport]] The airport is currently operated by the State of Alaska Department of Transportation. Complete with an [[Instrument Landing System]], [[Adak Airport]] has no control tower and two 200' wide asphalt paved runways at 19' elevation. One runway measures 7,790' long while the other runway measures 7,605'. Alaska Airlines operates twice-weekly Boeing 737 passenger jet service from Anchorage. At present, flights operate each Wednesday and Saturday, weather permitting. Occasionally, extra seasonal flights are operated to meet the demand of the fishing season.\n\nOther facilities in Adak include three deep water docks and fueling facilities. The city has requested funds to greatly expand the Sweeper Cove small boat harbor, including new breakwaters, a {{convert|315|ft|m|0|adj=on}} dock and new moorage floats {{Attribution needed|date=August 2010}}. There are approximately {{convert|16|mi|km|0}} of paved and primitive roads on Adak, all privately owned by the Aleut Corporation.\n\nThe Aleut are also seeking to develop their water system, which has been well-maintained and -designed for a larger Naval population, as an export industry.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Alaska Journal of Commerce |date=August 20, 2010 |title=Aleut Corp. wants to export Adak water |author=Wesley Loy |url=http://www.alaskajournal.com/stories/082010/loc_adw.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823223357/http://www.alaskajournal.com/stories/082010/loc_adw.shtml |archivedate=2010-08-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Tourism==\n{{manual|date=January 2020}}\n{{more footnotes|date=May 2015}}\n[[Image:Kuluk Bowl Adak Aug 2007.jpg|thumb|right|At Kuluk Bowl for bowling August 2007]]\n\n[[File:A hunter at sunrise on Adak, with Mt.

There are no radio stations within 200 miles (320 km) of Adak; radio can be received in Adak only through satellite or shortwave receivers.\"\n\nThere are multiple different locations to stay in the city; the former naval base housing can be rented by various companies for long and short stays. Unfortunately cabins that were once maintained by Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge have fallen into disrepair and are unsafe to occupy. Camping is legal without a permit on the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge land but due to the harsh climate it is not recommended to do so. The wind on Adak is highly variable and often unpredictable (the record speed is unknown because the wind ripped the anemometer off of the tower).\n\nBirdwatchers often travel to Adak and nearby Attu Island, as many vagrant birds from Asia and elsewhere can be spotted there. Bald Eagles exist there in high numbers.\n\nDeveloped trails are limited and most are not maintained. It is possible to hike on the tundra, but visitors are advised both to prepare for frequent weather changes and to never hike alone.\n\nNightlife and dining opportunities are few on Adak. The Adak General Store is open sporadically during the week. Two restaurants operate in Adak: the Bay 5 (which is housed in the same annex building with the liquor store) and Blue Bird Cafe.\n\nHunting and fishing continue in Adak, especially [[caribou]]. There is no bag limit for cows, but in 2007, the Board of Game passed new regulations for bulls. Hunting access to the south end of the island involves two licensed local boat charter services: either Aleutian Adventure Tours or Homeward Bound Charters. Anglers can access halibut in the [[Kagalaska Straits]].\n\nHunters must possess an Alaska state hunting license and a harvest ticket for each animal taken; non-residents of Alaska must also possess the appropriate big game tag. Anglers require a sport fishing license. All areas of the island with roads are owned by the Aleut Corporation, and a special permit is required for all non-residents accessing this private property. No ATVs are permitted within the wildlife refuge and the Aleut Corporation only allows ATVs on the roads and trails, not on the tundra. Under Alaska state law, [[wikt:wastage|wastage]] is illegal.<ref name=\"WR1\">{{cite web|url=https://weekendroady.com/2016/10/14/adak-americas-fringe//|publisher=Weekend Roady|accessdate=2017-04-14|date=2016-10-16|title=ADAK \u2013 AMERICA\u2019S FRINGE}}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n* [[David Vann (writer)|David Vann]]: author\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Alaska}}\n* [https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/dcra/DCRAExternal/community/Details/3f694e33-bff6-4cb8-a468-60cb72e9f571 Adak] and [https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/dcra/DCRAExternal/community/Details/8dd56833-769f-45ba-a7e0-23e5a558afde Adak Station] at the Community Database Online from the [[Alaska Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development|Alaska Division of Community and Regional Affairs]]\n* Maps from the [[Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development]]: [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304201029/http://labor.alaska.gov/research/alari/images/maps/6_2_1map.pdf 2000], [https://web.archive.org/web/20151222092405/http://labor.alaska.gov/research/census/placemaps/00065.pdf 2010]\n* [http://www.adakisland.com/ Aleut Corporation's official Adak page]\n* [http://climate.gi.alaska.edu/history/aleutians/adak.html Adak Maps]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130810223218/http://alaskamaritime.fws.gov/visitors-educators/caribhunting/adak.htm Fish and Wildlife Service information for Adak hunters]\n* [http://www.adakupdate.com/ US Navy site documenting Adak environmental hazards]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100823223357/http://www.alaskajournal.com/stories/082010/loc_adw.shtml Alaska Journal: Aleut seek to export Adak Water]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150725180424/http://www.adak-ak.gov/ City Website]\n* [http://navycthistory.com/adakhoyt01.html  Article and pictures of visit to Adak July 2006 by retired Navy veteran]\n* [http://www.tprophet.org/dialtone/adak.htm Narrative travelogue of Adak trip taken August, 2006]\n* [http://www.tprophet.org/alaska2006/adak/ Pictures of Adak taken August, 2006]\n* [http://www.geocities.ws/kwajsurf/Marine_Barracks_Adak_Alaska.html MARINE BARRACKS ADAK ALASKA]\n* [http://www.orneveien.org/adak Photographs of Adak from 1944 from many contributors.]\n* [http://www.adakmemoirs.com/ Adak Memoirs] Memoirs and photos of Adak wanted to preserve history, Nov 2011\n\n{{Aleutians West Census Area, Alaska}}\n\n{{Coord|51.872|N|176.636|W|region:US-AK_type:city(70)_scale:30000|display=title}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cities in Alaska]]\n[[Category:Adak, Alaska| ]]\n[[Category:Cities in Aleutians West Census Area, Alaska]]\n[[Category:Cities in Unorganized Borough, Alaska]]\n[[Category:Populated coastal places in Alaska]]\n[[Category:Road-inaccessible communities of Alaska]]\n", "name_user": "Daknalo", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eUtilities, schools, and health care:Fix CS1 error", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adak,_Alaska"}
